Subtitles by MacRellen Translation by google, and a bit of imagination. Turn my eyes away from seeing vanity; with Your ways sustain me. Fulfill for Your servant Your words, So I shall be in awe of You. Keep me from bringing shame upon myself, For Your laws are good. Rachel, we must be strong for our father. Father. Drink, it will do you good. My youngest daughter, Naomi. In late summer, with God's help, we'll celebrate her wedding to Michael. Naomi, I know that losing your mother is very hard. But my mother will be glad to help with the wedding. Invitations, table seatings,... You got me out here for this? It is hard for me to... -I understand that, but it is necessary. -Sorry, but I can't think about it now. I can think for the both of us. Isaac, Jonathan, go to your grandfather! I didn't see...I shall leave. It's all right. Touching without intent is not a sin. No, God forbid I was thinking that! Of course you respect the rules. Naomi, no one is more modest than her. For five years she did not go to the synagogue in her shiny shoes,... ..afraid they would reflect... - Rachel! I think this is women's talk. I'll go back to your father. Exuse me. "Women's talk"...as if we were idiots. Naomi, you have an enviable and desirable fiance. In seven years, he will be head of a Yeshiva (religious school), like father. And you and your children, four, maybe five, with God's help,... ..you will wait for him all night. -Rachel, that's enough, now! What is "enough"? What's wrong? It's just... You said "head of a Yeshiva". When I was little, I wanted to become head of a Yeshiva, like father. Well, you were young. Remember how you used to scratch your chin, as if you had a beard? Naomi, why aren't you asleep? It's late. I'm not tired. And this calms me down. Let me help you. No, father, why? Go to bed, it's been a hard week. We have had a hard week. But we must return to our lives,... ..staying on the right path, the path of God. But I don't need to lecture you, right? I like to listen to your words. So...How about a passage from the Gemara (a part of the Talmud)? In the Gemara it is said: Why try to be without grief and sorrow? For there is no love without sorrow. And there is no true comfort, without repentance. -But the question is... -Father... Sorry to interrupt, but I want to ask you something. Ask me about what? The marriage... If we could... ..postpone it for a while. Not drop it, just delay it. So that in the meantime, I can study at a midrasha (religious school for women). Naomi. You can not let emotions control your life. What we have been through these last months,... -It can shake the faith. - No, father, my faith is strong! But before starting a family, I want to devote myself to studying. I want to experience God, like you have. And not just an hour here, an hour there. And in a place with no distractions, in an atmosphere of holiness. Naomi, I am very proud of you. I have been able to give you a love for learning. But you don't need to study the Midrash. Your mother did not complete her studies, before we got married. She was a wonderful wife, a devoted mother. -Nothing is more important than family. -I know. -"The wise woman builds her house" - I know. But, father, "One can not take a woman to wife without her consent". Even when you were little,... ..when you asked a question, you already had the answer. Which midrasha? The main thing in life is to be happy. Sing, my sister. No. Believe me, if I start to sing, no one will be happy. Why? Sing! Everyone sings. Can you not sing? *quoting something* Sing! Excuse me, but you use the phrase out of context. *quoting something better* Understand? Do I look like I'm fasting? Though a little fasting would probably do me good. Such command of the Biblical Law. Bravo. Look, there, on the mountain. Is that Safed? It's beautiful. -Excuse me? -Yes? -Where is midrasha "Daat-Emmet" ? -Over there. Excuse me, I heard you asking for directions. I didn't mean to eavesdrop, God forbid, but I too am going to "Daat Emet". Do you want to share a taxi? It's not far. We can walk. -Naomi. -Sheine. You can call me "Sheine-shmeyna" (fatty). I may as well tell you, before you come up with it yourself. Not that I'm that fat, but I could lose weight in a few places... Look, how beautiful. Do you think this is a sign for us? -I'm engaged. -Engaged to be married? Congratulations! By the way, if your husband has any unmarried friends,... ..feel free to introduce them to me. My unmarried girlfriends have asked me to pray for them here. They have heard that in Safed there is a direct line to the Lord. -What do you want? -Help me! What do you want? I have told you, again and again. It's not possible! -Goodbye! -If you won't help, what can I do? You tell me God says "no". God says, God says! I do not know what God says. I only know God's law. Understand? I have a lot of work. Good bye! You're an educated man. And wise. Please, tell me what to do. I'm so sorry for what I did. Please believe me. I am sure... -Don't touch! -I need God's help! -Do you want some snacks? -No, thanks. I have a lot, so if you want anything, help yourself. -Hello. -Hello. -Is this room 6? -Yes. -My name is Sigi. -Sheine. Welcome. -Naomi. -Sigi. Oh, thank God I'm here. -May I? -It's Sheine's. -Feel free. -Thanks. You can feel the spirituality in this city, can't you? Have you met the rabbanit? There is a meeting with her in half an hour. This woman is a saint, she saved me. If not for her, my life would be a mess. They say she knows the Torah very well, and is a great matchmaker. You forgot a blessing. Blessed are you, Lord, who creates the fruit of the tree. I'm just recently into religion, so I have my flaws. I forget many things. So please correct me, OK? I swear I will do my best. It is forbidden to swear. So I say: "God willing". Right, OK. Thank you for telling me. It's important. "God willing". Thank you. I am very proud of you, that you're here. Is there anyone here who just told her parents:... .."I want to go to study in a midrasha". And her parents without arguing said:... .."Please, go and learn?" Of course not. Clearly you had family members who opposed it. Who said you'd be wasting your time. Who said it has no practical use. That it leads to no degree, and no profession. So why do you, dear girls, go against the tide? We are here. This is midrasha 'Daat-Emmet'. Rabbi Meir told us:... .."One is required to bless God for the bad just like for the good". This means that God is with us in both good and bad. Well done! I would like to... Come in, please. There is a place, please sit down. Let's go on. What is the relationship between love and fear? Like with parents, obedience to God can be out of love, or out of fear. In the Torah we are told both to fear God, and to love him. Why is obedianc out of love better than obediance out of fear? Anybody else? Girls? Ok, go ahead. Relying on fear alone, is not a good path. Rashi said that he who serves out of fear is lesser than he who serves out of love. For if the task is demanding, he who serves out of fear will flee,... ..while he who serves out of love, will always return. In other words... A dog in here? Where is he? It's just a telephone ringtone. Excuse me, we have a few rules in here. One being that cell phones are only allowed in your rooms, OK? Is that clear? Look, it's the new girl. -What is she doing? -Looking for a suite with a jacuzzi. Sorry for talking crap. It's because of the exitement, the first day here. Excuse me, but this is our room. Do you need any help? -Is it possible to open the windows here? -Yes. Good. Since it's just you three, there's room for me, too. In the room I got, the windows won't open, so the smoke bothers the other girls. Do you smoke cigarettes? No, I smoke fish. Is there a problem with that? Yes, it's a problem. Naomi is asthmatic. So I'll open a window, OK? The winter is very cold, so we cannot leave the windows open. In Europe, the winters are much colder. And I slept with the windows open, there. Besides, if you have asthma, fresh air is good for you, right? Don't give me that look! In Europe, you didn't learn to respect others? What an idiot! Easy girls. Remember that you should love your neighbours. Come on in. You can take the bed next to mine. -Thanks. -You're welcome. Girls, stay together, so you don't get lost. I don't understand why I have to stay in this dump. Not only do we have to study all day,... ..we also have to prepare and distribute food to the needy. I've had enough! # And the Lord alone shall be exalted in that day # # And Jacob was alone, and wrestled with a man # # until the break of day # Ever since the midrasha was established,... ..it has been important that the students not only learn here,... ..but that they also give something of themselves. Which is why we run the soup kitchen. It really is a blessed work. Watch it! Are you not normal? -I'm sorry, it was an accident. -But it still hurted! I said it was an accident! What is wrong with you? -Sorry, it was an accident. -Nice, you have matching answers. -I'm warning you! -Oh, I'm really scared! Bloody bithces! God forgive me my language! Have you all lost your minds? Girls of your age, what a disgrace! To be able to help you, I need your help, Michal. Michelle, not Michal. Michelle. I understand that you did not wish to come here. From what your father told me, you had some problems in Lyon. No problems, just different opinions. Understand that behaviour like this afternoon's,... ..will give you a bad reputation,... ...and make it difficult to find you a decent suitor. So is that why he sent me here? Do not worry. I will make sure that Dad will give you a fine donation,... ..even if you don't find me a match. OK? Why is it so cold? Are you mad? It's freezing! Michal, could you close the window? It's cold. Michal! Michal, it's like Siberia! Michelle! Michelle, not Michal. Are you cold? Put on a sweater. On top of this? With your figure it hardly matters. What? Michelle, we are four people in here. Can you not smoke outside? Thanks for the ruining my last cigarette. Have I complained about the noise, when she's munching cookies at night? Chocolate, cookies...do you not get enough dinner? Eating all night! ?If one shames another person in public, it is as though he sheds his blood.? Are you reciting these phrases, because you have no thoughts of your own? -Easy, girls. Calm down. You shouldn't... -Sigi! As I recall, you were not supposed to stay in this room. So any problem is yours. My problem is that I wanted to smoke a cigarette before going to bed. And now, I have. Is there any shop open at night, in this dump? I hate people who invent new rules. Are there not enough in the halakha? (jewish religous law) Such people, like Naomi, they... I do not know what it is in Hebrew, but in french we say:... .."ma merde n'a pas d'odeur". -My own shit has no smell? You speak French? My grandmother was from Morocco, and I spoke french with my mother. Stop, the shop is this way. How is that you speak hebrew so well? I was born in Israel. We moved to France when I was 12 years old. My father found work there, and we have family there. You're not from a religious home, right? -It shows? -Not really. I just had a feeling. No matter what I do, people will not see me as righteous. Is it because of things you have done with boys? I do not want to talk about it. Why not? You did it out of love, right? In secular society, it's not always easy to distinguish lust from love. It's beautiful! Sure, let's go. -Could you buy me Marlboros? -No problem. What? Why? You can not play klezmer like Elvis Presler. Presley. Elvis Presley. -OK, Presley. -How do you know about Elvis Presley? Did he also play with his mother at weddings? -Do you have a light? There you go. Thank you. You speak French? Yes, I'm from Paris, and you? From Lyon. I've lived there the last few years. Are you here on vacation? No, I study here. So what is it you study, exactly? How to be a good mother and wife, after the jewish law? No. I ask, because when I was in Safed a few years ago,... ..there were no colleges for girls. We are studying the Torah and the Talmud - exactly like men do. But I thought that among the orthodox,... ..women were not allowed to study to become rabbis. Like among the catholics, the men prefer to save all knowledge for themselves. Actually, it's a true revolution. So you study, like the rabbis? -Michelle. -It's late, and I delay you. Sorry. -Good night. -Good night. Who was that apparition? In this city, no matter how strange you are, there is always someone stranger. Hawa, Shifra, Shlomit. Shane, Sigi. This woman, to whom you will bring food, has some problems. So I decided to send someone responsible, that's you. She has been in jail, for many years, abroad. This morning, she called and asked to be added to our list of needy. She doesn't speak Hebrew too well. So she asked to have sent someone who spoke French. So I'm sending Michal with you. You are in the same room, right? Yes. She's been in jail,...why? As far as I know, she was arrested for murder. But she's not dangerous, she is very ill. Good morning. -What? -Good morning! Good morning to you, too. I wonder if she killed only once, or if she's a serial killer? The rabbanit did not say who she killed, did she? Who, what does that matter? Doesn't matter, I'm just wondering. I'm coming. Oh, we have met before! Yes, at the square. -You know her? -We brought you food. -We can help you unpack... -What's going on? Calm down. I just offered to help her unpack the food. Unpack? But we're not maids, we're just supposed to deliver the food. What's the problem? What are you afraid of? Would you like a cup of tea? Everything is kosher, I'm a vegetarian. Yes, thank you. How long have you lived here Nearly two months But I also lived here many years ago. Why? I lived with someone. An artist. We lived in the artists' quarter. We're finished, we should go. Why should we go? She's made us tea. -Aren't you gonna drink? -You drink yourself! It's not polite. Sitting here without touching your tea! Michelle, that's enough! You're not well? Shall I bring you anything? No, no, it will pass. Is she praying for me? She's reciting psalms for you. Each passage is devoted to some part of the body. And all this she knows by heart? -You too? -Me? I'm not even close! She is gifted, though not polite. But when it comes to the Torah, she's a master. Thank you. -Did it help? -Possibly. However, it usually passes. Michelle, we must go, we have a lesson. OK, I just need to visit the toilet. Excuse me, but where is the toilet? To the left. I'm sorry, but there is no door. After being in prison, I can't stand doors. Sit, sit! Pardon. Thank you for the words that you said. You know a lot of..."secrets". "Secrets"? No, it's no secret. Study. -Let's go! -Wait, let's stay a little longer. -Michelle, we're late. -Just a little while, we have time. Should you be smoking? When the doctor found that I have a weak heart, he told me not to smoke. But when I got diagnosed with cancer, he said I can do whatever I want. You have both? When God is angry, he is truly angry. What did she say? I only know that his name is Ephraim, and that he studies at the Yeshiva. The rabbi says he's a good man. That is already a bad sign. I've been with too many "good men". Each one turned out to be worse than the previous one. OK, but why not give him a chance. With this attitude, you'll scare him off. Believe me, it's not my attitude that scares them off. I look awful! There are two things on my body that I really hate - my chin. -I know who she killed. -What? I went on the internet, and found her case. It was big news in France. So who did she kill? Amen. She killed this artist, about whom she talked. A certain Joseph Cohen. He was her lover. -What? She killed him in Safed? -No, no. She was married to an accountant. They had a normal life: home, children, a car. Then she met this artist. Passionate love. She left her husband and children. Then they travelled here, and lived in Safed for three years. And then he left her and returned to France. She went after him. The newspaper wrote that his skull was broken with a blunt object. In court, she said that they had a fight, and that he slipped. Slipped? Well, one usually slips when hit on the head. So she broke his skull? Yes, she did. Quite romantic, is it not? Girls, girls, excuse me! I am pleased to be the bearer of good news tonight. We congratulate Bracha, our beloved teacher. Last night, she got engaged. # Many women have done worthily, but you surpass them all # Great, that's farewell to my engagement. Statistically, there can't be two engagements in one day. Why not take it as a good sign? Go on, ask for her blessing. Let's go! I don't want to, Sigi...Well, OK. # And the Lord alone shall be exalted in that day # # And Jacob was alone, and wrestled with a man # # until the break of day # It is fascinating that she killed because of love. Could you kill your fiance if he left you? -I couldn't kill someone. -I'm speaking hypothetically. Let's say it's this great love,... ..that you just can't live without. I have never thought about it. Thought about what? Love? Do you not love your fiance? So you've given up on love? Such a beautiful, clever, and promising girl like you? Clever? Me? I thought that I had no thoughts of my own, so I just recite phrases. Listen. At my bat mitzvah my mother bought me a poster. It had a guilded frame, very beautiful. And on the poster was written:... .."God, please, shut my big mouth before it is too late." What is your interest - the painting or the painter? I am sorry. The rabbanit told us a little. And I searched the internet. Don't believe everything you read. Journalists wants the sensational, and that's not always the truth. Not that I am completely innocent. I only defended myself. I did not murder him. And even after 15 years in prison... Naomi, bring some water. What's wrong with her? Why did you reopen her wounds? I did not pry. She started to tell me. I am sorry that I reminded you of all that. They say that...time heals all. But in my heart, time leaves marks. And now, when my time has nearly come,... ..the thought of dying,... ..without God's forgiveness,... ..it terrifies me. If only... ..someone could help me... ..to connect with God. To feel him. To talk to him. Maybe you? Maybe you could help me? -Naomi, wait, let's talk. -What do you want to talk about? About what? This poor woman begged us to help her. -She's alone, she has nobody. - She has nobody, because she's a killer. How can you be so cold? Have you got no heart? She is looking for redemption. She is looking for the path to forgiveness. -That is between her and God. And not us! -Look, all of this can not be coincidental. You putting off the wedding and deciding to come here to Safed. And me coming here, when I usually go against my father's wishes. And this poor woman from France, living right opposite the midrasha. And so? And the rabbanit picks you and me, and sends both of us to help her. -To bring her food, not to help her. -Call it "to bring her food", if you like. It's not logical. Why is it suddenly now, she decides that she needs the Lord's forgiveness. And why does she want us to help her? What does she think we can do? It all seems suspicious to me. -Suspicious? Don't be paranoid! -What do you want? Together we can help her find redemption. We can help her cleanse herself through tikkun. (kabbalistic cleansing / healing rituals) Are you crazy? tikkun? What are you talking about? Do you think I'm Holy Saint Naomi? Wow, a sense of humor! Bravo, welcome to the club! -The first sign of humanity. -Michelle. OK, so maybe I don't know what I'm talking about. But everyone knows you're brilliant. It won't be hard for you searching the books for ways to help her. What? Are you crazy? Nowadays, every other person seems to think they are religious experts. To do this, we need years of studying. We need comprehensive knowledge of the mishna and the gemara. (The two parts of the Talmud) To me it seems you know a bit about it. -And even then it can be dangerous. -I'm not asking you to create a golem. I just want us to do a good deed. Please... Please... Repentance amends for your sins, and usually they can be rectified at once. But sometimes you need time, suffering, or even death for atonement. And? The Rambam (Maimonides) wrote about the stages of repentance. 1, you must leave the sin. 2, you must intend to not repeat it. 3, you must regret having done it. And additionally, it must be put into words, spoken. -So, no problems? -Yes, there is. When you sin against other people, you should also seek their forgiveness. -Which is hard when it comes to murder... -Sigi, studying hard? However, insanity might be redeeming. Killing out of love, out of madness. That's insanity, right? And did not the Ari (Isaac Luria) say that for every sin there is a fix, a tikkun? No need to be alone. Go sit with them. What are you doing? -What are you studying, my dear girls? -We're not studying, just looking. -Do you need any help? -If we do, we'll ask you. -Naomi? -Yes? We still haven't talked in private. Would you come see me tonight? -With pleasure. -Good. I have lived in Safed for nearly 20 years. But I am still touched by the holiness and spirituality of this city. -Please, have a seat. -Thank you. I feel that behind your calm face, you are hiding a big grief, right? My mother died 10 years ago, bless her. -But still there is a huge void. -Yes. The first year is very difficult. I think you made a wice decision, coming here. I hope so. Blessed are you, Lord, by whose word everything comes to be. When I was your age, there was no such possibility. And I know that our liberation is more complicated than that of secular women. We face not only male dominance, but also the laws of Halakha,... ..written by men 2000 years ago, reflecting their views on women's place. -I hope, I'm not scaring you? -No, no, quite contrary. We are now in the middle of a quiet revolution. We cannot speak out loudly. But maybe, God willing,... ..already in our generation, we will se a woman become a real rabbi. Imagine... Naomi. What did she want? Nothing, really. I've been reading more on healing, and I have a great plan. Come. Now, come! It's a great plan, I must tell you! It's cold! I promise the window will stay closed, until easter. Would you like to come under the blanket? I have been thinking. And first of all she needs a spiritual cleansing. We need to take her to a mikveh. (ritual pool) Any ritual bath will not do. We need a mikveh, with living water from natural sources. When did you get so learned? You think you're the only one who's clever? And I thought that we should take her to the Ari's Mikveh. That's interesting, but the Ari's Mikveh is for men only. -Women are not allowed to enter it. -I know. But I have a plan. Do you want to hear it? I'm not sure. And how do you know that this water will cleanse me? Inside, I mean. It's not a bit simple? I know women bath to cleanse themselves after menstruation. But this is different. The blood is not mine. She wants to know why water is needed. Tikkun is filled with symbolic acts. The idea is to enter another state of consciousness. When entering a mikveh, you are cleansed, ritually and spiritually. She says the ritual purifies you, also spiritually. -It symbolizes rebirth. -It's a sort of rebirth. But is it not dangerous to enter the Ari's mikveh? It's not for women, right? -Is it not guarded? -There is an attendant, but we go at night. And also, I heard that for 400 shekels, the attendant might take a small nap. I'll bring the tea. Your mother, did she ever take you to a mikveh? Once. When I was 8 years old. Because I insisted on it. I have to comb you, to remove any tangles. Do you have a brush? My children,... ..they don't want to see me. They hate me. For many years, I've been trying to contact them. I wrote them letters. But for answers...nothing. Children are not able to understand a mother's love. Even a bad mother's love. No love can compare to it. You don't understand? I'll call Michelle. Are you OK? I don't understand a word she says. Don't leave me alone with her! All right, calm down. This prescription is for Anouk Kesner. But none of you are Anouk Kesner. That's right. But she sent us to pick up her medicine. She's in pain, and out of medicine. Do you want her phone number? I need it in writing. Go back and bring a written permission. But we have class in 15 minutes. Wait a moment, I've seen you somewhere! We met just the other morning on the stairs, right? So you're the pharmacist? -Six m's. -What? m's. Six m's. I have a habit: when I hear phrases, I count how many times the letter m is used. And you used six m's. It's a hobby. Charming. One m. That's interesting, but we're in a hurry. Sorry for my nonsense. How may I help you? -There's this woman... -You cannot help them. We're from the midrasha. When we last met, you saw us carrying bags, bringing food for Anouk Kesner. Tell her! Yes, that's true. It's OK, they are from the midrasha. It's not OK. I'll do it, but it is not OK. "It is not OK." I heard you playing the clarinet the other night. You play beautifully. Thank you. Where did you hear me play? At some event? A Bar Mitzvah? No, I saw you in the window. You played with an older woman. An older woman. Yes, that's my mother. -Will it take long? -Just a minute. We need to undress,... ..say a prayer,... ..enter the water,... ..and immerse ourselves in a fetal position. And we must only pray. Do not speak. Normally, you would enter the water alone. But since you are sick, Naomi thought we should go with you. I did not think it would be so difficult. For many years no one has seen me naked. In my youth, I was very proud of my body. But now, it has betrayed me. What does she say? It's difficult to undress. She is ashamed of her own body. My mother, bless her, used to say... ..that immersion in the mikveh taught her to be at peace with her body. After giving birth, during her illness. Tell her. -She says... -Wait. I trust her. Be gracious to me, O God, according to Your kindness. According to Your great mercies, erase my transgressions. Wash me thoroughly of my iniquity, and purify me of my sin. For I know my transgressions, and my sin is always before me. Blessed are You, Lord, King of the Universe,... ..who makes us holy by embracing us in living waters. You don't feel well? Do you want painkillers? No, I'm not hurting. I don't know why, but I'm not hurting. When I was in the water,... ..it felt as if it entered my body, and cleansed me in some way. I don't understand, but I feel it. Tell her that what she did,... ..even if I don't understand,... ..that it worked. She says she feels good. It worked, right? I think so. You think so? Just look at her! I know it's late, but I would like to continue. I don't want to wait. She wants to continue now. No way, she needs to rest. And we need to reflect to understand. So what should I say to her? When do we proceed? Tell her that she should go to sleep, and so should we. She said that you need to rest. Better not to argue with her. Don't be afraid, but I want to ask you... It has been so long since anyone... I want to embrace you. Please. Don't panic. She wants to hug. Me first, OK? To remove sickness of the soul, the Ari says the medicine is:... .."fasts, sackcloth, ashes and stripes, ritual immersions and purifications". While the Rambam says that for some sins pain is necessary for forgiveness. And he quotes the Psalms:... .."I shall punish their misdeeds with a rod, and their iniquity with stripes". You know what this means? It means that tikkun, the process of restoration, it may require suffering. By mortifying the flesh, we destroy our desire to sin. Michelle, get some sleep. Well, I will not leave you here alone. Wake me up before morning prayer. -I think this might scare her off. -Not if she is serious. -Michelle, I am not the same size as he. -That's no problem. It's itchy! That's the idea. -Shalom aleichem -Shalom. Safed is a small town, so we keep meeting each other. 4 m's. What? 4 m's? Be careful, or you may make a maniac. For me, it started in classes in Yeshiva. I counted m's, to keep from falling asleep. Tell me when next time you're playing, so we can come and listen. -Really? -Yes. What? "What?" You're just spinning his head. -Me? -Yes. And who cancelled meeting her fiance? Twice already? Don't remind me. He'll come next week. For sure. He is a good person. But we have nothing to talk about. So I don't want to be alone with him. -So maybe I should come, too? -What? That's stupid, Michelle! Why? Listen, it'll be cool. I'll ask the rabbanit if she can get me a date with Mr. Pharmacist. And we'll go together. Wait a minute, I don't understand! How did you find a tikkun-ritual, when there is none for her sins? It wasn't me who found it, it was her. Naomi is brilliant! It relies on the Ari's words, that for every sin there is tikkun. It is put together from four different rituals:... ..for the dying who can not leave this world,... ..for the dead who has been excommunicated,... ..for women who has killed their children,... ..and for souls who cannot find rest. From this she created a new ritual,... ..of cleansing, fasting, suffering and confession. Amazing! She could be one of the women the rabbanit talked about, who will change the world. -You are a genius! -Totally! How did you to hide it from us? Thank the Lord, for putting me in the same room as you. For only this, coming here was worthwhile. And for a husband, of course. -We want in. -Michelle said it's OK. I know we agreed not to tell anyone, but Sigi and Sheine can be trusted. Michelle, this is not OK. It won't make much difference if they join us, no? No. So what's the matter? Is something wrong? Naomi, are you OK? Are you OK? You're not mad at me, are you? What is it? What is this? Why are you wearing this? It's for me. What do you mean it's for you? How can I help with her tikkun, if I myself... Sit down, sit down. Raise your arms. You're crazy. Why? I'm a horrible person, I think only of myself. -That's not true. -In the mikveh, I realized it. Did you know, I did not even cry at my mother's funeral? Enough. I have an ointment. It's itchy. It is uncomfortable, but that's the point. You mortify the body, to break down the resistance... ..that stands like an obstacle between yourself and the truth. Are you all right? You have been fasting since yesterday, right? But with all the medicine you're on,... ..if you will feel unwell, you can break the fast. I don't want to stop fasting. I want to follow the whole ritual, with every detail. You shouldn't pity me. It's open, Naomi. Maybe it's pathetic, but every time I hear a knock on the door,... ..I hope it's my son, coming to surprise me. When I hear footsteps outside, or a car, I rush to the window, to see if it's him. This thing is quite painful, but necessary, I know. There is something else. I am afraid that the truth will shock you... But to help me, you should to know everything. I only hope it won't scare you off. What is she doing? There is something she has hidden from us. Whatever it is, we won't run away. OK? My last souvenir from Joseph,... ..and what was between us. It's some paintings he left here in Safed, at an art gallery. I couldn't throw them away, I don't know why. Before you purify me, so that I can be forgiven,... ..I should show these to you. Even if you are disgusted. Perhaps it is necessary, for me to be forgiven. In this picture, it looks like you're in pain. But your face expresses exctasy and excitement. The body has its own life. One can not always control it. I told you that I hate my own body. I have a feeling, that it is hiding something from me. Hiding what? Maybe we should add a little red? -No, Michelle! -It'll look very nice. -No, I don't use lipstick! -Come on, it will look great! -Michelle, it's not who I am! -It won't change who you are! -All right, then. -Good! -But just a little! -Just a little. -How are you? -Good. And you? Blessed be the Lord. Your father asked... What's that on your lips? You don't like it? Is that how girls do around here? Your father is holding a series of lectures on wisdom and justice. The discussions can go on all night, straight on till morning. Yes, that's how it is here, too. Really? Yes. What's with the condescending face? God forbid, not condescending... But you cannot compare the lessons in the midrasha, with those of your father. Nor our discussions with yours. Do you think I cannot learn like you? Well, you're different. But in general women should not study like men? It is not I who say so. It's written in the Talmud. Shalom. Sorry for being late. That's OK. I was half an hour early. It doesn't matter if I wait a half or a whole hour. Besides, somethimes there's a sweetness in waiting. You know, I was rather surprised when the rabbanit talked to my mother. You're not a local, and it is not common for... I apologize if anything confused you or your mother... No, don't apologize. It's all right. Tell me, can I ask you something personal? How come a good-looking guy like me is not married? How come, in this town, with the yeshiva,... ..you're playing... Why am I a klezmer-musician, and not a rabbi? My grandfather was a well-known klezmer-musician. My grandmother wanted to kill him, for being obsessed with music. But as I child, I loved to hear him play. And you know;... ..music that comes from the heart, lifts you higher than a prayer. -The kabbalists say so. -They do? Interesting. -13 m's, -Michelle? Naomi! I don't believe my eyes. What are you doing here? This is Michael. -Well met. -Well met. There are no free tables... You can join us. You don't mind, do you? No, not at all. Please have a seat. -Well met. -Well met. -Yanki Meyzlish. -Michael Reznick. -You look familiar. -Yanki is a brilliant clarinet player. Thank you. Klezmer? Wonderful. But I used to study at a yeshiva, The Ponovich. So, the studies didn't work out, and you started... That's right, yes. I'm studying in Bnei Brak, where her father is head of the yeshiva. Before that, I studied in Jerusalem. I am from Jerusalem, of course. Ah, a jeruslamist? -Is that a klezmer expression? -Enough, I'm hungry! Waiter! Jeruslamist! Where have you been all my life? Shall we split the bill? Fifty-fifty? No, it's OK. It's on me. -It's only fair fifty-fifty. -No, it's OK. Klezmer might not be the most respected music,... ..but it pays well enough, Thank God. Waiter...please? -Your store... -It's not a store, it's a pharmacy. I'm not talking about that. Your pants,...the store is open. My bus will be leaving soon, so we should pay. I'll pay. Fifty-fifty. -I'll pay. -Please, fifty-fifty. What's so funny? I'm sorry, it's just... No, it's my fault, sorry. I just told her a joke. Naomi! You're still in mourning. Watch it! Look what you did! Sorry, sorry! What's so funny? -Naomi, why so tense? -I'm OK. -No, you're not. -Yes, I am. I can see that you're not. -Sheine and Sigi won't say anything. -I'm not worried. Sigi's becoming devoted, maybe fanatically. Enough, Michelle. The Lord is Truth. He keeps His word. -How repugnant! -And when it's someone we know... -Exactly. -That makes it feel more sickening. And all souls he created shall praise Him. Not to return to these sins,... ..for ever more. And I repent. I am filled with remorse. By all the strength of my heart,... ..I am ready to atone. I shall wear sackcloth,... ..on my skin,... ..as a reminder... ..that I have sinned... ..against what is sacred. Let Your will be,... ..our God and God of our ancestors. For your judgements... ..are fair judgements,... ..and you are the only Judge. May it be Your will,... ..to forgive our sins,... ..and pardon our iniquities. Forgive us, Lord. Grant us atonement. After mother's funeral... ..I had an asthma attack. It may sound crazy, but... I felt that I saw her there. I wanted to stay and hug her. I didn't want to breathe again. Now, do you see why I'm so cold? Now I understand why I returned to Safed. I knew that this place could bring me closer to God. It has been years since I could breathe like this,... ..without pain in my chest. -What is she saying? -She says you're brilliant. -I'll get dressed. -Do you want something to eat? What's that? Someone is playing. Why is he playing here? Is he serenading someone? It's indecent, playing to the girls. It's so romantic. I keep thinking about the next tikkun. What about you? I don't know. What don't you know? It feel she's not telling us the whole truth. How so? It might have taken her some time,... ..but she did tell us about Joseph, and show us those paintings. Michelle... She's not jewish. What? How do you know? In the photo with her children, she's wearing a necklace with a cross. And if she doesn't tell the truth, the tikkun is worthless. So what does she want from us? That worries me. -Naomi. -What? You're the cleverest girl in the world, but... ..sometimes you think too much. It's all right. What matters are her intentions. Even if she isn't jewish. Perhaps she's not telling us, because she's afraid we wouldn't help her if we knew? Right? -It's cute. -What? Always when you think, so do your eyebrows. Michelle, let me do that. You're our guest. Guest? You just told me I should make myself at home. -Let me... -No, no! Were you just being polite? Don't treat me like I'm a guest. Your friend is just like you. There's no arguing with her. Rachel. Your cooking resembles your mother's. It's the same love and joy that she brought to the shabbat. -Thanks, Dad. -You should teach Naomi. And me, too. I love to cook. Please, teach me... I remember coming in to the kitchen one day. Mother was standing here, head in her hands,...crying. So what? Sometimes even she had a bad day. It happens to anyone. -Why do you always focus on the bad? -I don't. I didn't think mean to spoil the mood. Of course not. Sometimes it's hard to cope with grief. But we can't give in to it. Which is why it's said that it's a great mitzvah to be happy. (mitzvah = duty, commandment) And there is joy in keeping the mitzvahs. Tomorrow morning, Naomi, we'll stay at home and study together. And your dear friend can join us. -Good night to you all. -Good night. Let's go, Michael. -Naomi, when will you stop... -You have a wonderful father. Lucky you. In my family at festive meals they always discuss business. Even when we eat, they only think about work. Does anyone want two second-hand children, in good condition? You know, I never had a friend for a sleepover. Really? I feel like I'm in the sixth grade. Oh my! We haven't done our homework. Oh, your hair is loose. I'll take a photo. -No, Michelle, stop. -We need a memory from the sixth grade. What are you thinking about? About mother. I'm sorry you find yourself in the midst of a family drama. It's just that the memories came back,... ..memories I didn't expect. I hope it didn't make you feel uncomfortable. Not at all. I'm an expert on family drama. Would you rub my back? Do you like that? ?Rab asked Rabbi Hiyya: Whereby do women earn merit?" "By sending their children to learn in the synagogue,... ..and their husbands to study in the schools of the rabbis." What does this mean, exactly? How does a woman earn a place in the next world? We know how a man earns his place through studies of the Torah,... ..and observance of the mitzvahs. Why are women exempt from this? It may be that women... I am very sorry,... This morning I spoke with my father. He had told my aunt and uncle that I was here. And they were hurt that I hadn't come to visit them. So we agreed that they will pick me up here,... ..and I'll stay with them for the rest of the holiday. I am sorry for leaving so abrubtly. -Is this because of last night? -Nothing happened. Michelle, let's talk about this. Wait a minute. -Not now, they're waiting for me. -What, are you angry with me? Why the rush to leave? I'll sleep on the sofa. -It has nothing to do with that. -Well, really? You always talk about feelings, and now you just leave? Naomi, calm down. We'll talk in Safed, OK? Tell your father I said thank you so much. Michelle. Now, when we're alone, Naomi, I want to ask you about something. You said last night that you saw your mother crying in the kitchen. What did you mean by that? I have been thinking of... ..of mother's misery. That we could have helped her. But her cry for help was so quiet, it was easier to just not hear it. To let her continue to cook, and clean, and...to just ignore it. Not that we meant to neglect her, but... Naomi, what happened to your mother was a tragedy. But it was God's will. Why are you always looking for faults? -Because I feel that I... -But you said "we" In plural. In fact, you say that I am to blame, too. That is what you mean, right? Anouk! You're back before the holiday's finished. So are you. -I went to Anouk. She's not at home. -I know, I was there. -So where is she? -I don't know. Have you tried calling the hospital? I was sitting,... ..when suddenly I felt a pain in the chest. Then I started sweating cold. And my heart was beating really fast. I tried to get up... And somehow I managed to call an ambulance. I was afraid...of not having time to complete my penance. And I thought of you two,... I thought of you two, and of my children. I asked the doctor to let me go home. They can no longer do anything to help me. But we have a task to complete. Her condition is not good. I have been living alone for so long. Loneliness is a punishment. But, perhaps, thanks to you... ..because of what you've done for me,... ..I might see my son again,... ..and my daughter. Before I die. That's all I want. -Do you mind if I turn off the light? -No. I can't take this any longer. -Let's talk. -You said nothing happened. Why are you making such a big deal of this? Big deal? So what is it to you, a small thing? -How many times have you done this? -Are you crazy? Never before have I... Not even in my mind. And neither have I. I didn't even think that I could feel like this. -So for you this was just a game? -God forbid! -But this is forbidden. -Nowhere is it written that it's forbidden. I have checked. -That can't be right. -It is. The Torah states that you shall not lie with a man as with a woman. Rashi condemns only sodomy, and not other sexual acts between men. Sodomy is forbidden, because the "wasting of seed" prevents procreation. But for women, there are no seeds, so there is no prohibition. -So what we did, it's not a sin? -No. If you would ever open a book,... Why do you talk to me like that? Look at me! I'm devastated. And you never cry. If I could... No, don't. What do you want from me? I want you to forgive me. I'm coming. Michel? Mother, we must forget about the past. Either way, we cannot change it. And I love you very much. -These are for you. -Thank you. You remember what flowers I love. -A hug? -But of course. I'm coming. It's open. My son Michel is here. He came on a surprise visit. He is in there, looking around. Go meet him! -Her son has arrived. -Her son? What an amazing surprise! These wonderful girls are helping me. But there's no one here. But that's not possible. He's there. He should be here. It's a prank, right? He's probably in the bathroom. Michel? I don't understand. Michelle, get some water. In the hospital, she was probably given lots of medicine. But I thought... My son... I thought... I was sure... I'm sorry. You should rest. No, let's continue. Is the only thing that protects me from myself. Without you, I would have gone crazy. I'm ready. This penance is more difficult than the others. Tonight I know that I shall face the truth. The absolute truth. And I know that truth is inside me, but I don't know how to find it. It is therefore we chose the cave of Shem and Ever. This is an extraordinary place in Safed. -Is this it? -Yes. According to tradition, this is the first Beit Midrash. When others still were pagans, and worshipped idols,... ..we were here, searching for the truth. We brought the Tanakh (Bible), to give you strength during the ceremony. Thank you, I'll need it. Coming here in her condition, she's resolute. One can't forget she's a murderer, but still... She must see this through to the end, or else it's worthless. I also had to repent, when I became religious. # Guardian of Israel # # Guardian of Israel # # Protect the remnant of Israel # # Protect the remnant of Israel # # With love, with love # # Those who say, 'Hear O Israel' # The most terrible thing I did,... ..was abandoning my children. Even if I did not mean to. It is a horrible thing. That I had,... ..taken a life,... ..That I had killed,... ..For a long time,... ..I could not admit what I had done. Don't stop. Confess all this filth, the dirty paintings,... ..what you did, what made you do it. Translate it to her. Continue. Tell it all. The paintings,... ..all the horrible things you have done, and why you did it. Free yourself. I want to cleanse myself. Truly. But... ..my love for Joseph,... ..my desire for Joseph,... ..I don't know why, but... ..I don't feel the need to... ..to ask penance for that. I don't regret anything. Wait a minute, "regrette rien"? What she does not regret? Love is love. And my love for Joseph... -Sigi, enough! Tell her to stop. Michelle, what is she's saying? She says that love is not something she repents. These filthy paintings, are they of love? It's disgusting. Tell her! -Sigi, stop shouting, we should... -It's not love! It's not love! It's bad! -We can't continue unless she repents. -Sigi, calm down. With these paintings, how can I be calm? This is her tikkun. Let her do it the way she feels it should be done. What "as she feels"? I also feel different things, but i control myself. Sigi, calm down! If we don't tell her, she will think that what she did with that man is normal. Listen, it's not like this, not good. Like this, is not good. -God is very angry! -Sigi, don't meddle. It would be easy to say that I regret. But we decided to tell the truth, and I think God will... Don't tell me "God"! Don't say God. Don't talk about God. -I really... -Sigi, stop it! -It's not up to her what to repent. -Sigi, it's not your business! If she wasn't telling the truth, and if she doesn't repent everything,... ..we should leave immediately. Because now we are desecrating this site, and she is still holding the Tanakh! Stop it, Sigi! What are you doing? You are wrong. This is a tikkun, Sigi. And you come from religious families. Phoneys! Let me go, Sigi! Get up. This woman came to me, asking me to save her. I told her I could not, that it is up to God. That her sins are so grave, halakha says she should be punished by death. Both for the adultery, and even more so for the murder. -But there's always... -Be silent! Now listen to me carefully. You have caused much damage. A few months in the midrasha, and you think you are experts in kabbalah? Is that what you teach them here? What a disgrace! The tikkun is based on the teachings of the Ari and the Rambam. Do you compare yourself to the Ari? Honoured Rabbi, I will split the girls up. And of course, they will not return to that woman. -But who will bring her food? -Someone else! It is only out of respect for your father, that I don't ask for your expulsion. And for the closing of the midrasha! But if one more time, only one more time... It is clear, it is clear, honoured Rabbi. Neither Naomi nor Michal,... ..wants to be expelled from the midrasha. Right? Right!? I'm coming. Naomi and Michelle, I'm coming. I understand that you're mad at me, but I had to tell the rabbanit. God willing, someday you'll understand that I did it to save you. -I don't expect you to understand now. -Is that so? As a snitch who just recently became religious,... ..I find it hard to believe that God made you his personal secretary. Easy now, girls. Easy. Michelle? Michelle? You frightened me, jerk. -Shalom. -Hey. -I missed you. -So did I. -What shall we do? -I don't know. -I called her after the evening prayer. -And? She sounded weak and confused. I told her we can't continue, but she didn't understand. She kept talking about the last tikkun. I don't know how, but we have to help her. No matter what. Talking about "no matter what", I have news. What? I'm not getting married. Are you serious? I'd like to get an education, and if you want to,... ..if it doesn't make you panic,... ..we could find a flat together. What, does it scare you? Yes, a little. Look, if we move in together, and then one of us wants to date some guy,... ..that is all right, of course. -Of course. If you don't want to, you don't have to. Don't be silly. Hello, I am Moshe, a medic in an ambulance. I'm calling for...what's your name.. ..Anouk? Anouk. She is now on her way to the hospital, and asks you to come. What? Urgent? It is urgent. Did anyone see you leave? I don't think so. Thank you for coming. But before I die,... ..we must finish what we started. I want to be ready...to meet God. What does she say? She wants the final tikkun. Tell her that I'm not prepared. I did not bring the books. I'll tell her that we'll come back later. Excuse me. We'll be back later this evening,... ..but if there's a worsening in the condition of Anouk Kessner,... ..please give me a call. Here is my number. She can't call you. It's Friday. I'll put the phone on vibrate. When I see this number, we'll come. Vibrate? You know phones are forbidden. I know, but this is about saving her life. I'll write down my number. What if she calls in the middle of the shabbat meeting? What do we tell the rabbanit? What do we say? Michelle, don't! # messengers of the Most High # # of the Supreme King of Kings # # the Holy One, blessed be He # # Peace be upon you # # ministering angels # # messengers of the Most High # # of the Supreme King of Kings # # the Holy One, blessed be He # # Clothe yourself in fine garments as we light and bless the candles # # We finish all our labours, on Shabbat we will not work # # To rejoice with delicacies, fowl, quail and fish # # To rejoice with delicacies, fowl, quail and fish # # messengers of the Most High # # of the Supreme King of Kings # # the Holy One, blessed be He # # Peace be upon you, ministering angels # # messengers of the Most High # Where are you going? Now? Excuse me, girls. I know it's shabbat, but she insisted that you come. Blessed are You, Lord, King of the Universe, who sanctified us with Your commandments,... ..and commanded us concerning the washing of hands. Amen. Naomi. Don't leave. We are here for you. We are with you. God is no longer angry with me. My girls. My dear ones. Thank you. Blessed be the righteous judge. Dear girls,... ..we are all saddened by the expulsion of Naomi and Michal from the midrasha,... ..but let us not dwell on this, but get back to our studies. Please open tractate Berakhot, as I want to start right away. Page 54. Wait! Wait. How lucky that I caught you. I just heard this morning what happened to you,... ..so I quickly ran to say shalom. You're sweet. I would prefer impressive, courageous and unforgettable. But sweet is also OK. I brought you something. This is so you don't forget Safed. -It's not great, but it's OK. -Thanks. You're really really sweet. And? And...impressive and courageous,... ..and manly. I brought you a letter. To read on the road. Open it later. Fine. I must not miss my plane... No, of course. Have a nice journey. -Thank you. -Bye. Please, driver. Would you play this disc? I've missed you. My love. Look, what a beautiful home I have arranged for us, right? You must be tired from the flight. You want something to drink? Nothing? Where are your bags? And why didn't you want me to pick you up at the airport? Michelle, you worry me. What happened? What happened, darling? I did not arrive today. What do you mean? -Then when? You said that... -Four days ago. So where have you been? In Safed. I...I don't understand. -I'm terribly sorry. -What? -Michelle, what happened? -I don't know where to start. Where to start? Tell me what happened. Come on, Michelle, you're scaring me! Listen. I've been thinking about it. Well? I don't like this. What "this"? What do you mean, "this"? "This" what? "This" what, Michelle? -Well, I'll just say it. -Tell me. You're very, very dear to me. But I'm going to marry Yanki. I just cannot do it. Understand? I just want to... I want to have a normal family. And I'm not normal? Michelle? I'm not normal? Naomi? What are you doing here? I looked for father in the yeshiva, and they said he hasn't been there all week. Is everything all right? Ruth said: "wherever you go, I will go, and wherever you lodge, I will lodge,... ..your people shall be my people and your God my God." Father, I don't want to interrupt, but... Father, if this is not a good time,... Something to drink? Hot, cold? I'll go put the kettle on. We have some cake left from the shabbat. Nothing is better to relieve the tension. -I think I'd better go. -No, stay. If our visitor has something to say, it should first of all be to you. I'll go lie down. Dad... Michael... You know that I respect you very much. -And I do appreciate you. -Do you have any idea what you have done? Do you know how much harm you have caused to me? To your family? To your father? Who gave you everything. -I'm sorry, I'm did not mean to... -Did not mean to! Such a smart woman like you, and you "did not mean to"? This is all a result of your heresy. -Heresy? -Heresy. Or do you have another word for these systematic attempts... ..to harm and undermine the way of life prescribed by the Torah? Rabbis and sages, the likes of which do not exist today,... ..have established laws with defined roles for men and women. And you join this idiot dream that a woman can become a rabbi? Who gave you the authority? Anyway,...that's me. But your father... Your father is filled with guilt. -He feels guilty, for teaching you. -If he feels guilt, that is not why. How can you say that! Have you completely lost your mind? How dare you? How? Do you know that you could lose everything? Is it worth it? It's open. The vacant room is on the left. Feel free to look around. Shalom, Naomi. I am sorry for coming unannounced,... ..but I thought that if I called to ask, you would not agree to see me. I left the door open, to avoid us being alone,... ..so that you may feel at ease. If ever you can feel at ease with me, now. What do you want? In fact, I haven't come for myself, but for Michelle. I know she can't take coming here, so I decided to do it for her. Well, I shall not beat around the bush. I know that we sent you an invitation by mail,... ..but I have come here to personally ask you to come to the wedding. Thanks, but I can't come. I expected you would say that, but... ..I wanted to say that you are very important to her. And Michelle will be very sad if you don't come. She loves you. She loves you even more than me. You talked about me? If you mean whether I know, than yes, I know. I was shocked when she told me. Even I was shocked. I'll not lie to you. And I don't know why she told me. I know that she loves you, truly. I don't want to talk about it. By the way, you don't need to worry. Nobody knows, but me. I understand that you are hurt and angry... I couldn't come, even if I wanted to. And I don't want to And if I came, I would only ruin things. I can't control myself. Now, please leave. Can I say one last thing? You know, I'm not an expert on love, but... ..when it comes to music, I know a little. When it comes to music, you are taught to play the right way. But sometimes, if you don't play it right, ...that is also right. # She opens her mouth in wisdom, the teaching of kindness on her tongue # # She watches over the ways of her household # # and she does not eat the bread of idleness # # She opens her mouth in wisdom # # and the teaching of kindness is on her tongue # # She watches over the ways of her household # # and she does not eat the bread of idleness # # Her children rise up and celebrate her # # Her husband praises her # # Many women have done worthily # # but you surpass them all # # Her children rise up and celebrate her # # Her husband praises her # # Many women have done worthily # # but you surpass them all # # She opens her mouth in wisdom # # and the teaching of kindness is on her tongue # # She watches over the ways of her household # # and she does not eat the bread of idleness # # Many women have done worthily # # but you surpass them all # Naomi, wait. I thought you might pass through here on your way to Michal's wedding. Michelle. Naomi, in a few years, when you look back on what happened... ..you will understand that what I did was right. There was no other way, Naomi. Do you know how many rabbis would be happy to put down the midrasha? When you grow up you will realize that you can not bang your head through a wall. And in order to achieve a higher goal... It is OK to leave a dying woman alone, so as not to make people angry? God forbid, we did not leave her alone. We continued to send her food, even though we new that she... That she wasn't jewish. Well, that was the problem, right? I understand how you feel. You are so like me, when I was your age. No, I'm not like you. I am not a coward. May the barren one (Jerusalem) rejoice, when her children gather in joy around her. Blessed are You, Lord, who causes Zion to rejoice with her children. Let these beloved companions rejoice,... ..as you made your creations rejoice in the Garden of Eden. Blessed are You, Lord, causing joy to the bride and groom. Blessed are You, Lord, King of the Universe,.. ..who created joy and celebration, groom and bride, rejoicing,... ..jubilation, pleasure and delight, love and harmony, peace and friendship. Blessed are You, Lord,... ..who makes the couple rejoice together. -Amen. "If I forget you, Jerusalem, may my right hand forget its skill. May my tongue cling to the roof of my mouth, if I do not remember you,... ..if I set not Jerusalem above my highest joy." Congratulations! Want to dance? Michelle has a cousin she wants to introduce me to. Charles. Doesn't it sound romantic,...Charles. Put me down. Excuse us, Sheine. Thank you for coming. You forgive me? No. WARNING: Beware of the beguiling mackerel! Don't let yourself be led astray by her sweet tongue. "She swayes him with her pretty words; she seduces him with her smooth talk."
