[analog audio buzz] [dramatic music] ♫ [percussive synthesizer] ♪ [electro-saxaphone] - I'm sorry. I'm very very sorry. I know I was wrong, Don Carlo. I didn't intend to hurt you! I... You know I'll make it up! I'll make back all the money! You know I'm good for it! [sharp exhale] Oh, God. I'm sorry! I truly am! Please! You gotta believe me! [sighs, whispers] Oh God! Look, I know I should have come to you first. I know that. But you're a very busy man, and I didn't want to bother you with my problems! I just needed a few things! That's all. Oh, Don Carlo. Please forgive me! You know, it... it's not all my fault! You know... You see... I have this problem. [nervous chuckle] Yes. I have this... drug problem. I know it's a bad thing! But, I'm taking care of it! [deep sigh] An-and that's why I didn't come to you before! I thought I had it under control. And like I said, you're a busy man, you don't need to b-be bothered with something like this! [Don Carlo] Tanya, you're right. You're right! You're right about one thing! I don't have time for all this. - You see where I'm coming from! That's why I didn't want to trouble you! [nervous chuckle] You are a busy man! You have so much to think about! You don't need me to bother you with some drug problem! And like I said, I finally got it under control! - So, you buy your shit from Salazo? You come here, [mocks] 'Oh, I'm sorry!' You don't think that hurts the family? - Hey! What's the matter with you? Where did I go wrong? Huh?! I took you in off the streets! Gave you a place to stay, three squares a day. And, all the clothes you could want. And, this is how you say, 'thank you?' This is how you repay me? - I said I was sorry! I'll pay you back all of it! - I never wanted your money. It's not a money issue! All I ever wanted was your respect. Vinnie, come here. You never let anybody know, outside the family, what you are thinking, ever again. - All right. Sorry. ♫ [ominous] - Now, Tanya, do you really want to make up for your mistake? - Oh yes, Don Carlo! I do! Anything you ask, I'll do it! Just ask! All I want is your forgiveness. - My son here is not very happy. Now, it would make me happy, if you made him happy. Could you do that? - Oh. [nervous chuckle] Yes! Oh! Thank you! Thank you so much, Don Carlo! You are the best! Oh! [laughs] God! I can do that. I can do that for you! [whispers] Thank you! You know, you can join in, if you want. - I'm just here to watch. - Oh, that's too bad. You're going to miss out on all the fun! [Tony chuckles] - My loss! - Thank you so much for believing in me. What will make Vinnie happy today? I think I know. This should do the trick. [silence] [thuds] [softly] - Oh, yeah! [Vinnie pants] [Tanya grunts] Want me to do this, Dad? Huh? ♫ Want me to do this, Dad? Huh? - Oh, and another thing. [speaks Italian] [gunshot] [Vinnie pants & thrusts] [softly moans] [sighs] [Don whispers] Tom's a copper. Just throwing that one by you. Get Tony and Guido, and you know what to do about it. [Vinnie whispers] - Right Away. Come on, Tommy. We've got some business to do. - What kind of business? [nervous chuckles] - Hey! I'm just asking. - Are you gonna sit and talk or you gonna come with me? - I'm coming. Goodbye, Don Carlo. - Arrivederci! [door shuts] Khopper! [engine cuts] [doors close] - Vinnie, what the fuck are we doing here? - You are just full of fucking questions today, aren't cha? [scoffs] - Hey man, take it easy! I'm feeling a bit left out of the decision making process, all right? - I'm sorry, Tom. You're right. From now on, I'll let you in on all of the decisions. - Vinnie, I don't need to be in on all the decisions. I just... [airplane] - What the fuck are they doing here? - Decision number one: Beaten, or, shot? - Vinnie, what the fuck is going on? - Just what I thought. He can't make up his mind. [slams] [Guido] - Come on Tony! - Fucker! Little shit! Hold him! Hold him! Ok, go! [Tommy groans] [Guido] - Get him! [pained cries] Get him! [Tony] - Piece of shit! [Guido] - There ya go! [Tony] - Give me that bat! Fucking pig! Piece of shit! [Vinnie] - Okay, all right. [coughs, gasps] - Hey, Fucko! Got me all sweaty, ya cock sucker! Nice suit! [Guido] - I got a date tonight. - Nice suit, pig! Piece of shit! [Guido laughs] [coughing] - Fuck you! [Tony] - You're the one getting fucked, pig! [Vinnie] - Guido, don't get any blood on that suit of yours. [Tony] - Fucking pig. - Eh! How do I look, huh? [Tony] Ya' look good! [spits] [Tommy] - Fucking Guinea bastards. [Tony] - Guinea? [Guido laughs] - Guinea bastards are standing over you. [Guido] - Look at him! Does he look Italian? [Tony] - He looks like a piece of shit to me. Eh? Eh!? You wanna squeal for me? C'mon pig, squeal! Squeal. Come on! C'mon, I said fucking squeal! You fuck! [Tommy spits] [Tony] Piece of shit! - Decision number two: Shoot you or let you bleed to death? [Vinnie] Oh, he can't fucking make up his mind? Huh? That's why we don't let you make the decisions. You can't think. Cops are too stupid. I think we'll never find out what Tommy found out. ♫ [speaks in Italian] Guido, take care of this fucking shit. - NO! NOOOOOO! [gunshot] [Mayor] - Now what am I going to do? How can I tell my constituents that it's safe, when our own cops are being killedt? - And, three of the best cops that we ever had. People understand that undercover work is very dangerous. - And, it's not that they're not valuable police officers and great people. It's just that, in our line of work, sometimes people get killed. People have to know that, and they just have to accept that! - I know! It's just the press has been saying that I'm too soft on crime. And now in the last few months, these three cops get killed. Well, I'm beginning to get more heat than ever. - Look, we're doing what we can! - It's not enough! You don't know what it's like trying to get elected these days! You have to lie to everyone, even your wife! It's to the point you have to break the law, in order to get into a position to make the law. - Sir, I understand what you're saying, but we have to work within the law. - I'm the law! I give you permission to do whatever you have to! I just want Don Carlo brought to justice. [Officer Marge] With all due respect, sir, we have rules we have to work within. - Now, you can help us bend the rules, but we still have to play fair. - Ah. Well, I don't give a shit how you get him! You can get the wives of the dead cops, for all I care! But. Get. Don. Carlo. ♫ [ominous] [Jasmine] - What are we gonna do now? [Asia] - I don't know, my money's running out. [Jasmine] - Well, it'll be okay. I mean, we just have to be there for one another. You know? I don't know, maybe we could move in together? - Well, that's a possibility. But, I mean, ever since my husband died, my regular income isn't coming in. I mean, I can't live off of his insurance forever. You know? Besides, [sighs] Money's not the only thing that I'm missing. It's getting really lonely at night. - God, I know what you mean. Just last night, I rolled over and I had no one to hold. ♫ [saxophone] God, I miss those late night lovemaking sessions. - We still need money. What are we gonna do? - Fuck! Why don't we try stripping, or something? - That's probably what I'll end up doing. - I'd do it with you. [Jasmine] - Are you guys crazy? [scoffs] Stripping? Are you out of your mind? - Jasmine, our husbands are dead. Nothing's gonna change that. We have to think about ourselves and what we're gonna do. - You're right. Guess I need to start living my dreams. You know, I just still miss Tom. And, I don't know. I just wish it were different. - We all do. [cell phone rings] [beeps] - Hello? Oh, yes. Hi. I'm fine. Thank you! Uh, well, as a matter of fact, they're here with me right now. Oh, okay, hold on. Can you go down to the station now? - What do they want? - They want to talk to us about something. - Sure. - Why not? - Okay, we'll be there in 30 minutes. Okay, thank you. Buh-bye. That was strange. - Yeah. I wonder what they wanted? - I don't know, sounds like they want us for something. - Maybe it's a fundraiser, or something. - Well, we'll never know if we stay here! - Yeah, let's go. I'll drive. [Officer Ryan] - I don't know if it's a good idea. I mean, if these women go undercover, and something happens, we could lose our jobs. - The ladies are more than competent. They're cops' wives. They know what it takes. - I hear what you're saying. I just don't want more innocent people getting killed, just so the mayor can get re-elected. - They. Won't. Get. Killed. - I hope you truly believe what you're saying, and it's not just wishful thinking. - Well, it's partly both. [phone rings] - Ryan. Yep. Take them to the conference room. Okay. [hangs up] - They're here. - Let's do it. [Ryan] Ladies, we'd like to thank you for coming. I'm gonna cut to the chase. We have something we'd like to discuss with you. - First of all, we want you to know you have our most sincere condolences. Your husbands were the best cops we've ever had on the force, and, the city and I will be forever grateful. - Marge and I have a plan we'd like to discuss with you. - Now the city is faced with one problem. We know who's responsible for killing your husbands, but we can't get him. He's very powerful, and he has a lot of influential friends. His name is Don Carlo. He's head of the strongest mafia family in this city. They call him "the Godfather." - What does that have to do with us? [Officer Ryan] - We'd like to ask you a favor. - What kind of favor? - We'd like to offer you a job. - A job?! - Oh, this is a different kind of job. - Different kind? - We'd like to see if you'd be interested in going undercover. - What? - Undercover? Like our husbands? - Yes, but, um, this will be in another capacity. It's a little bit different. - How different? - Let's just explain the jobs we need, and then you can decide to take it, okay? - I don't know. - Well, wait, Jasmine, let's just hear him out. But I definitely know I'm in! - So, uhm, let's hear what the jobs are. - First, the assignment is a difficult one. We can't contact you until its over. If we contact you before then? Then, it's over. - So, you mean it's dangerous? - Well, every undercover job can be dangerous. - Come on, Jazz. I mean, what do we have to lose? - Our lives, that's what! - Hey, we don't believe it's going to be that dangerous. [Officer Ryan] - What we need is for one of you to be a prostitute. Another one will have to be a drug dealer. And the other one will have to be Don Carlo's sex slave, so to speak. [Keylee chuckles] - You guys don't mess around. [Jasmine scoffs] - What kind of options are those? [Asia] - I'll do the drug dealing. I think that's the most dangerous job. - That is the most dangerous. Thank you for accepting. - Now, how about you two? - I don't think I'm up for this. - Jasmine, what is it? Are you afraid to get hurt? How dangerous could it be, being a sex slave? [Jasmine scoffs] How old is this guy? - He's 55. Hey, he probably just wants to watch you masturbate, that's all! - I don't know. - Come on, Jazz. I mean, look at Asia. She's gonna be hanging out with drug dealers. I'm going to be getting into strange cars with even stranger men. All you have to do is dress up in outfits and dance around for some limp old dick. - Jasmine, if you don't feel comfortable, you don't have to do this. - You two are really going to do this? - Hell yeah! [Keylee] - I always wanted to know what it's like to sell my body. I wonder how much I can ask for. - Keylee, listen to yourself! - Jasmine, I don't want to sit around and grow old! I want fun! Excitement! Adventure! - Keylee, I want all those things, too, but, there are better ways to get them! - Come on, Jazz! It could really be fun and exciting. - We'd like you to join us. We're doing this. But if you don't want to, then, that's okay. - You guys are really gonna do this. - Yep! [airplane] - Well, if you guys are gonna do this, then, I guess I have to do it, too. - Okay, great. Look, you guys have gotta get some rest. You're gonna need it. [Asia] - Okay girls, let's get started. - All right, thanks for coming in. Good luck. - You'll be in touch? - Yeah, thanks again. We will be in touch. - All right, thank you. - Thanks! ♫ [ominous] - It was easier than I thought it would be. [Ryan chuckles] - Now the tough part, keeping them alive. ♫ [ends] [Don Carlo] - Ahhh, Trixie, that feels so good! - I know what you like. I make it my business, my life, to know what you like. - And you're good at it, too! - Mmmm. - You've been very good to me. Never a problem, never a complaint. How'd I get to be so lucky? - Mmm, I'm the lucky one, Don Carlo. And, you know that I'll always be loyal to you. It's because I love you. And I want to see you happy. - Oh, I'm happy. How could I not be? [knocks at door] [Trixie groans] - Who's that? - Eh, it's Vincent. I got a few important things to talk to him about. [Trixie sighs] - Want me to go? [Don Carlo] - Nah, you can stay. Come on in. - Dad, did you want to see me about something? - Yeah, I need to talk to you about the family, and this business. You want a cup of coffee or a drink? - No, I'm fine. I'm all right. [relaxed exhale] [lips smack] - First of all, we control most of the prostitution in the city. And what I want to do is, I want... - Wait, wait, wait! Don't you think we should be alone? - She's family. - She's not my fucking family. - Oh, fuck you, Vinnie. [Vinnie] - Fuck you! - You're the fucking whore. - You're a fucking idiot! - Wait a minute! Wait a minute! Shit, you two are gonna give me a heart attack! I wish you two would quit the fighting, and just get along! Try, for me! Will you do that? - Not even fucking important. - Please? Will you try?! [Trixie] - For you, Don. I'll try to get along. - Good. Now, can we get back to business? Can we get back to business? All right. There's one problem I see on the horizon. It's that Sch-lazo punk. He's moving in on our cocaine business. He's taking over the west side. He's gonna want more. - I say we take him out. - Not now! The cops are still hot about those three undercover dicks we castrated. So let's lay low, continue to deal, and if Salazo gets in the way, then we'll act! - If I were you... - For now we lay low! - Dad, if I were you, I would take him out right now. - Well, you're not me! So listen up. One move by you and you won't have a father. Capiche? [mutters] - Capiche. - Don't do anything stupid. Women and children can be foolish, not men. And, I'm not as young as I used to be. So, I just think you should know a few things, before it gets to be too late. I want to be buried in Sicily, next to Teresa. [Vinnie] - I know that, dad. [Don Carlo] - I have a plot of land next to her's, and, I know you know. I just want to go over it with you one last time. You need to slow down and think before you act. This job takes guts, but more importantly, it takes brains. And a lot of patience. This book here has all my dealings in it. Everything. All the money we spent, all the money we took in gambling, drugs, prostitution, everything. ♫ [ominous] We made 50 million dollars last year. [Don chuckles] But, the IRS thinks we made only $50,000. If this book gets in the wrong hands, I'm finished. - Well, I better get going. I want to hit the streets before it gets too late. Vinnie, you'll have to drive me. It's Tony's night off. - Yeah dad, I better go too. Is that all you wanted? - That's about it. Just remember what I said. Relax. Take it slow. [Trixie] - Bye baby. I'll be back later. - Okay. [Vinnie] - Don't get any fucking ideas about that book! [Trixie] - Fuck you! - I saw you, don't fucking deny it! - What are you talking about? - Yeah, right! - You're a fucking sicko. They should lock you up before you hurt yourself. - You'd like that, wouldn't you? Then, you could finish off dad and take over. [scoffs] - Fuck you! - I'm onto your game. You've got dad by the balls, literally. And, you're blowing Tony and Guido for insurance! - At least they have something to blow. - Ooooh, ooh. All that coke must'a fogged up your memory. You remember choking on this for the job? - Oh, you-you are sick! You're fucking sick! [Vinnie laughs] - I'm late for work, so let's go. Don't drive like a fucking maniac, either. - You can suck my dick while I'm driving. - Oh, fuck off. [horn honks] - Go on, girl! He wants you! - I just got here! - Well, perfect! Time is money! Hey, I wish I was that lucky. Go! [shuts] [door shuts] [footsteps approach] - Busy day? [Keylee chuckles] - Yeah. I'm lucky, I guess! - If you were lucky, you wouldn't be here. There's nothing lucky about being a prostitute. - Yeah, I guess you're right. - I'm Trixie - Keylee. This is my first day. - I could tell. So, what's your story? Y'know? Why? What happened? Is it drugs? - No, no drugs. My husband left me. - Ooooh, I'm sorry. - I'm not! [Trixie chuckles] - Hey! Good girl! But you know, it's dangerous out here. You have someone to protect you? You know, someone to look after you? - Like, who? - Like, a pimp, you know? Someone to care for you, to look after you, and, bail you out, if you need it. - Uh-uh! No. Uh-uh, do you? - Oh, yes. ♫ [ominous] I've got a pimp. - Really? - He's the most powerful man in the city. - Really? - Mhm, he doesn't hurt you, he never harms you in any way. He's a nice guy. - Think he'd mind taking on another girl? - I don't know. Why don't you come back with me, and you can talk to him? - Sure, let's go! - C'mon. ♫ [Don Carlo] - Let me get this straight. Your husband left you without a penny? [Keylee] - Yep. - He just left? Got up one day and left, and took all the money with him? - Eh, he left a little bit. - Oh, I see. - She does great on the street. ♫ [ends] [Don Carlo] - Okay. [clears throat] There are some rules in the house. Everything I have is yours. And, everything that you make is mine. - Sounds good to me. - One more thing. If you come with me, you can never go back to your other life. Ever. [knock at door] - That's fine with me. [Vinnie] - I'll get it, Tony. - Hey, man! - How ya been? - Fine. - Good, good! [Vinnie] - Hey, hey! Oh, whoa! Who's this? [Guido] She's ah, friend of a friend. - We met through a friend, in Miami. - Who the fuck's your friend? - A friend! I was living in New York and he came up from Miami, said he had some work me to do. I moved to Miami, and I worked for him, for 3 years. [Vinnie] - What's his fucking name? - Who the fuck are you? - Hey look, bitch! - Vinnie! [Don Carlo] - Guido, if you say she's okay, then I'll take that as your guarantee. But if she's a cop, you're dead. ♫ [ominous] Now, Trixie, Kim, if you'll ple... - It's Keylee. - Keylee. Will you please excuse me while I do some business? - Sure. I'll show her to her room. - Thank you. - You're welcome! Now, run along and let me do my business. [clicks tongue] [door shuts] So, Guido. What have you got? - All right, Don Carlo. This is great. We got Salazo! He's selling about a million in blow. I say we buy. Double our money. It's easy. - Are you gonna take her with you? - And Tony. - I can fucking handle myself, okay? I'm carrying a piece and I'm not afraid to use it. [Tony] - Whoa, whoa, whoa! [Don Carlo] - Okay, okay! Let's keep it civil. We don't need any shootouts in here. Besides, you're not gonna scare anyone around here, little girl. When does it go down? - Tomorrow. One o'clock. - All right. Keep an eye on her. [Guido clicks tongue] - Oh yeah. [Asia chuckles] - And I'll keep an eye on Guido for you, ok? [chuckles] - Okay. You do that. And tonight, you stay in Kim's room. - I think her name is Keylee. - Kim, Keyley. Keylee, Kim. Whatever! It's a piece of ass, by any name. - Come on. I'll show you where her room is. - Thank you. ♫ - I don't know, dad. That's a problem, there. That's a fucking problem. [relieved sigh] - By the way, have I thanked you? - Well, you thanked me last night. But, you can thank me again, if you want. ♫ [saxophone] [Guido moans] - Your gun's stickin' in me. [chuckles] - Yeah? Well yours is sticking in mine too. - Oh, you're welcome. [Asia chuckles] - Let's get out of here. - Okay! - All right! [Vinnie] - That is a fucking problem. Something's fishy about that. [Tony] - Gotta nip that one in the bud. [Don sucks teeth] - Let me worry about that. ♫ [ends] - Keep an eye on Guido. He's thinking with his dick again. - He always does. Always does. - Just keep an eye on him! - I will! I will! [softer] I will, I will. - We don't even know who this bitch is! - I know, I know. - We don't even know who she is! - I know. - Just keep an eye on him. Just do it. - I'll talk to him. I WILL! [softer] I will, Vinnie. - Hey, there's uh, someone here to see Don Carlo about a job. - Well, unless you're leaving, we're not hiring. - Not leaving. It's not that kind of 'somebody.' It's a girl. - A girl, or a woman? - You better check this one out for yourself. - All right. Show her in. - Yeah, you got it. ♫ [saxophone] - This is Vinnie, Don Carlo's son. Vinnie, this is? - Tony it's ok, it's ok. I think I can take over from here, now. [soft] - Jasmine. - I'll be outside. - All right. [speaks in Italian] - Thank you, I guess. - Um, why don't you have a seat? Want something to drink? You okay? - Oh. No thank you, I'm fine. - All right. So, tell me. What uh... What brings a beautiful woman like you here? - Um, I'm in need of work. - What can you do? - Well, I don't really do much of anything. But, I need work. I mean, I don't do typing, or anything. - So, why'd you come here? - I heard your dad is a fair man. - That's it? My dad's a fair man, so I have to give you a job? - Well, if I could just, talk to him in private, I'm sure... - Look, if you need to say anything to him, you can say it to me first, okay? [stumbles] - It-It... It's just that it's kind of personal. - Do you want a job, or don't ya? - Yes! - Then, tell me why I should hire you. - I like the same things that he likes. - What do you mean? - Things. Sex things. - Ohhhh! Now I get it. Great! I thought that was going to be a lot harder than that. - Well it's, um, it's gonna have to be a lot harder than... this. - What do you mean? - I mean, everything that goes to my dad, goes through me. Everything. - You mean if I want an interview with your dad, I'm gonna have to... - Show me your résumé. [nervous laugh] - Well, hmm. That's the strangest job interview I've ever heard! But, um, I guess I'll give it my best shot. ♫ [ominous] I'm sorry, I'm really nervous. - That-that's okay, that's okay. Just take your time. ♫ [intensifies] Ah, here. Hey, I'll tell you what... Have a seat. Have a seat a second. Um. I'll probably get in trouble for this. But, uh. Don't say this to anybody. Just, um. I'll get you in to see my dad, and we'll get you a job. Just do me a favor. Don't tell anybody about this, okay? [whispers] - Thank you. ♫ [Don Carlo] - So Jasmine you had a tour of the house? Good. I understand you're highly qualified. [chuckles] So, you're probably wondering what it's all about. Well, let me just say that I'm not that demanding. I just like to have you here when I want. Now that means, if you wanna go anyplace, you have to check in with me before you leave. - That's fine. I mean, I probably won't want to leave, anyway. This place is so peaceful. - Good! What do you say you come over here and tell me what you like? [Jasmine murmurs] - Uh. I guess clothes, I could do without. - Mhmm. - Leather. Um, leather's always a nice touch. And uh, I have an assortment of whips. And uh, you know? Maybe a mask. - Huh. That'd be different. - And, uh, the rest, I'll just leave it up to surprise. - All right. Nothing wrong with surprises. [Salazo] - Little personal gift, my friend. - Ah, you are too kind, my friend! Too kind! - Tony, make sure he shares that with you. - Oh, I will. - Got a little something for you! - I suspect you probably do! I'll uh, trust you on the amount? - I hope so! - Take care of that, will ya? - Yes, sir. - Good doing business! - And as always, this was a real pleasure. Next time! - See you later? - Yeah! - Nice seeing you too Tony. - Definitely. I'll see you guys out. [Asia] - Just a second, gentlemen! I need to test this shit out. ♫ [ominous] Okay. It's good shit. - Well, thank you for your opinion! Guido, next time, keep your fucking pussy at home. - Hey, fuck you! - Would you like to? [Asia scoffs] - Yeah, as a matter of fact, I would. - It's about time you came around! - You just can't really be too careful about these things. Y'know? - Just come on over here to daddy, and I'll take care of you. [yelps in pain] [Guido] - Whoa, hey! It's all right! Calm down, everything's all right Just take it easy! It's all right... Tony! - Fuck that! What is she doing? - What kind of fucking shit is this?! - Just everyone easy, put your guns down! Asia! Asia, put your fucking gun down! - This sorry fuck better apologize to me otherwise I'm putting lead in his head! [Salazo] - Okay! All right! Relax, relax! - Put the gun down! - No, she's right! I was out of line! Just relax. [Asia] - Okay! That's better! Now get the fuck out of here. It was good doing business with you. [Henchman] - You know... [Salazo] - It's all right. Hey. - Buh bye, dickheads! - Guido! - Asia. [chuckles] Um, if you ever EVER pull a stupid stunt like that again, I'll kill ya. You know what? [sighs] Good job! - Hey, Don Carlo, sir! How about a little afternoon delight?! [Don groans] - Are you all right? - Hmm? Did you say something? [Don Carlo moans quietly] [Trixie giggles] [Jasmine] - What the fuck?! [playful hum] - Oooh! How thoughtful! - Fuck off. [knock on door] - Come on in. - Hi! I'm your date for the day! - Hello. But, I only have an hour. - We can do it in an hour. You look really familiar. - I have one of those faces. - I don't really see many faces. - How about this? - That doesn't look familiar. We'll have to talk price first. - There's two thousand dollars there on the desk. - Two thousand? - Yes. - For two thousand, we'll get really aquainted. [approaching footsteps] - Hey, why don't you get your own corner? - Why don't you mind your own business? - Look, if it wasn't for me, you would still be out here unprotected! - Thank you so much for saving my life. What would I have done without you? [car honks] That must be for me! - Ungrateful bitch. - You didn't have to do what you did. I would've made it just fine without you! - Yeah? Well, just watch your back around me from now on. Okay? [Keylee laughs] - A threat? I'm scared! [helicopter] [Asia] - Oh man! [relaxed sigh] - Another day, another deal! - Did you really sell coke today? - Yeah! [chuckles] Yep. - Man, I can't believe what we're doing. - Oh, I can. I've always dreamed of doing something like this since I was little. - Well, why didn't you? - Because I got married. - But, you loved your husband. - Yeah I loved my husband, I just loved him too much that I gave up my dreams for his. - Wait a minute. Your "big dream" was selling drugs? - No... not quite. [both laugh] But, just doing undercover work, you know? - Hey, Asia! - Hey! How's it going? - Fine, don't say hi to me! [Asia chuckles] - Did you make any cash today? - About six thousand. - No shit! - Oh you guys, we need to go into business for ourselves! - No, thanks! - No, I'm serious! I'm serious. - You really mean it, Asia? - Yeah! Hell yeah! We could make a lot of money, you guys. - And have old, stinky men laying on us all day? - Well, we'd pick out the men. - You know, though? We would need protection. Like... like Vinnie, or someone! - No, fuck that shit! We don't need anybody. We do it ourselves! - No, really! Really. I mean, there are ins-and-outs, do's and don't's... things like that. - Come on, guys! Let's stay focused. We need to get some information on Don and his illegal activities! - Fuck that! I always wanted to have my own business. I mean, I need to start thinking about my future. Our future. - I'm beginning to think you guys are all fucking crazy. Let's not forget what we're here for! - What are we here for? [car door closes, drives off] [footsteps approach] [horn honks] - Oh, am I the popular one! - Fuck you, bitch! - It would cost you! - Oh, hey, Vinnie. - Hey, Jazz! What are you dressed for? - Your dad, work. - Oh. Well, um, have a good time. - Bye. Hey, Vinnie! - Uh huh? - Um. I was wondering if you might wanna maybe, like, go for a cup of coffee, or something? [Vinnie sighs] - Look, Jazz. My dad owns you! All right?! If I were to fuck with ya, I'd be in trouble. - But, um what if I like, like you? - I still can't. - Not ever? - Maybe, you never know. But, who knows? - You mean, you might w-want, I mean, if you cou... - What? What are you saying, here? I might want you? - Yeah. - Of course. You're gorgeous. Who wouldn't? But... - But your dad. - Right. - Well, it's too bad. So, I better go. ♫ [whip cracks] - I hear you've been a bad boy. - What are you doing here? - A little discipline. - You just can't come in... - Shut. Your. Mouth. I didn't give you permission to speak! [sing song] Handcuff time! - Eh, I don't, I'm not... - Ah! Do as I say! Handcuff time. That's a good boy. [clicks] [purrs] How's that? - It was okay. - Something isn't quite right yet. I know. Yeah, I think we're ready now. [chuckles] Hmmm. Assume the position. Assume the position! Be a good boy! - You're not gonna hurt me, are ya? - Oh. [chuckles] I'll do it in a way that feels gooood. [Don grunts] - Ow! [pained grunt] - How do you like it? [grunts] - Ah! [pained laugh] - It's... it's okay. - Just okay?! [grunts] - It's getting better! [Don laughs] - What are you going to do for me tonight? - Oh! Whatever you want me to, baby! - You're speaking to me as a peasant. - I'll give you a bath, how about that? - What else?! That's not good enough! What else?! - Well, I could lick your face! How's that? How about if I lick your face?! - Lick my toes! [pained cries] - Get it right next time! - Ow! - Speed it up!? - Yeah! A little more, baby! Come on, a little more! Fuck, baby! Pick it up! Pick it up! [cries] [continued cries] Yeah! [painful laugh] Ow! Ow! I guess... All right! You win! I-I'll lick under your armpits! - Hey, you! - Uh huh? - It's only 50 for head, and 100 for a fuck! - I don't got 100! But I've got five thousand in there. - I never knew a man with so much money! Maybe I can get a permanent position with your office? - I think I could arrange that. We'll just have to keep it quiet. You know? Keep it undercover. - I can do that! - 'Cause I'm not as worried about the puiblic finding out as I am about my wife! She'd shoot me! - My lips are sealed. Well, sometimes they are! - Wait, wait wait! We can't do it here! - Be bold Daring! [moans] - Mmmm. [moans] - Hey, sweetie? I was wondering if I could have a minute of your time? There's something I want to talk to you about. - Okay, what is it? - It's about that new girl, Keylee. - What about her? - Well, I just think it'd be better if she found another place to work. She's moving in on my territory, and she's stealing all my clients. - It's a free street. - Yeah I know, but, couldn't you just ask her to stay off my street? - You know, you wouldn't want me to do that to you. Would you? - No. But I want you to do this for me. [sighs] - She's making a lot of money for me. Now if it's because she's on that corner, then that's where she'll stay. - Look, I make money, too! - Not as much lately! - Yeah, because she's there! - Well, maybe you should start to look for another line of work. - What are you saying? - I'm just saying you're not making the kind of money you used to be. [lightly scoffs] - Fine. Fine. So this is what I get for being loyal to you all these years? - Trixie, it has nothing... - You are making a big mistake! Because, I'm better than this. I'll show you! I can still out-fuck any of these girls. - Tony, tell me you're not gonna wear that suit tonight. - What's wrong with my suit, Guido? - Everything! It looks like you're gonna try to fuck a librarian! You're gonna plain ruin my style, here. I mean, I... - You have no style, Guido. - Man come on, I get laid every night! - And that's your problem, you think with this head too much. Never with this one. It's always about business. Always. - No, see, it's all about business for you. See, here you go. See this? That's making business, Tony. Now, the business day's over. We can go out. - This is how I do business. - Okay? - Ah, yeah. - This means something. Twenty, fourty, for Guido. That's yours for tonight. - Wait a minute! All right! You're gonna be like that? All right! This gun's pretty nice, though. I kind of like it. Hey, Tony! Stick em up! - You're such an asshole, I swear to god! - Oh boy, I'll tell ya. - Oh, you guys are funny! - Hey, Trixie! - Hey! - What's up? - I don't know. Just hangin out. - Yeah? You don't really hang out with us. [Tony] - Whatcha want, Trix? - What? What makes you think I want something? - You only come around when you want something. - Maybe I do want something! Maybe I want both of you. You know, the Don has been neglecting me lately. And, I just thought that you guys might be up for a little fun! - I'm up for some fun! I am up for some fun!! - Mmmmm. - You're always up for some fun. - Good! But first, I wanna talk. - I knew it! I knew it! You always want something! Never around unless you want something. What is it this time, Trix? - Hmmm, well! It's about those those new girls. And, the way that Don's been treating you guys. - I don't know about you, but the Don's treating us good. - It doesn't... It's none of your goddamn business how the Don treats us. - Oh, really? You don't care that they're making more money than you guys, and that when the Don's gonna retire, they're gonna be making even more money? More money, more power, more control. Mhmmm? - What are you trying to say to us, Trixie? - Nothing! - It's not nothing, Trix! Come on! - Oh, only that... Y'know. You guys have worked for the Don for lots of years. You've worked very hard! And uh, sometimes, you've even put your life on the line for him. And, for what? To get fucked over? Huh? - We're not gonna get fucked... The Don's not gonna fuck us, Trix. - If those girls get their way, you will. - And, how do you know all of this, Trixie? Hm? - I sleep with the Don. I know. Even I'm getting pushed out. [Trixie sighs] - How do we know it's not you getting pushed out? And, you're just here begging for some help? - Maybe I am, maybe I'm not. Either way, I'm gonna make it up to the both of you. - How you gonna do that Trix? - Yeah, how are you gonna do that, Trix? - You just leave it up to me! Okay? - Okay! - I'll even get you guys more money. - I could use a little more money, Tony! Huh?! - Yeah, the money's all right. But, what else, Trix? Come on. What else you got for us? - That's it. I just need to know you guys are behind me. Okay? - Pfft. I'll be behind ya. Or under you, or, on top of you. [Guido laughs] [Trixie] - Good. All right, we'll talk later. - Oh no, come on! - I've gotta go! - Oh, come on, Trixie! Trixie, please! - Bye! - Let her go, let her go. [disappointed sigh] - That ass. - I'm up for this! I say we do it! Make a little money. - You don't know what she wants us to do. - Oh, I know what she wants. Come on, huh! You have no idea what we have to do for it. So let's just hear her out first, and take it from there. - Alright alright. - It's like I told you before. Stop with this, more with this. - Tony, I'm with ya. Okay? Relax! Alright? - Just give me my gun. - You can take your fucking gun. [Don Carlo] - What are you doing in here? - I'm looking for my earring. - It's not in here. Now, get out. I have business. - I want to talk to you about something. - Talk to me later. - It's about... - About what?! - It's about the new girls! - Get the fuck out of here. - Look... [footsteps] - You heard him. Get out! [Jasmine sighs] Now, it's time for your lesson. - Yeeeah? Well, I think I'm ready! Now, don't forget my ABC's. I'm a little rusty on those. - Ah ah ah! Don't you remember that you're supposed to raise your hand in class? - Oh, certainly. I'll raise my hand. - You're staying after school. It's detention for you! - Oh, no! Not again! - Hmmm! You've been a bad boy. - Well, maybe you could give me some discipline? - Mhm! Oh, you're gonna get discipline, all right. [Don chuckles] - Get up! - All right! Ahh! [paper roll spanking] - You're bad!! [Guido sighs] - Whew! I have been waiting to do this all day! - Left. I'm always on your left. [Guido groans] - Fucking cry baby! [Trixie] - There's a book with all his business transactions. ♫ [ominous] Under his mattress. Now, if I can get him into the office, and keep him busy, you guys go in, take the ledger, and then you send it to the police. - Sounds fine to me. - When? [Trixie] - Tomorrow, at one o'clock. - Hm. You sure this is gonna work? - It's gotta, it's the only chance we've got. [Trixie] - Look, just get the ledger, and I'll take care of the rest. And then we can take care of those two other bitches later. [footsteps] [Guido long sighs] [Guido groans] - Uhh-huh. [Tony clears throat] [Guido] - Ohhh! [Tony] - So, I guess that's it. [Guido] - That's it! - Just like that? - Piece of cake, Tony! Piece of cake. - What now? - Don't worry about it! It's gonna work out, okay? [Guido continues] And, this time tomorrow? No worries! [gunfire] [explosion] [Guido] - What the fuck is going on? [Asia] - I didn't like those guys. - What!? I don't give a shit who or what you like! This is a business, for Christ's sake! Oh shit, you fucked up, Asia! The Don is not going to be happy... I didn't like those guys, okay?! ♫ [ominous] [gunshot] ♫ - I warned you about that bitch! Told you. Nothin but trouble. Ya don't wanna fucking listen to me? Well this is what happens. The Don is not gonna be happy. - This is not a good time, Tony! - Nothing but trouble since day one! - She's fucking dead! Give it a rest! - Yeah!? But this shit never should've happened! Never should've fucking happened! You let shit get like this all the fucking time! God damn it! It's not only your ass! It's fucking Asia's ass, and it's mine! Don's gonna come down on me! You're with me, she's w... - I fucking know! - No, you don't. - For Christ's sake, I heard ya! Just shut up! ♫ [upbeat] ♫ ♫ [phone rings] ♫ [ends] - Some people just don't know when they're being rude. [rings] Hello? This better be good. Yeah. How'd it go? What happened? And it's done? What about the money? [Don whispers] Shit. Who? Asia? [sighs] Did you kill her for that? ♫ [ominous] Good. Okay. Get home right away. Yeah. And, Guido? Good job. [phone sets on receiver] [tired long sigh] Okay. Now uh, where were we? - Wait a minute! Wait a minute. Ah... did somebody get hurt? - Someone got in the way. - Who? - Never ask me about my business. - I thought I was your business. - You are. A small part of it. A very small part of it. And, you know all you need to know. You don't need to be bothered by all these little things. Now, come on. Come back over here. Remember where we were. That's right! [relaxed] Ahhhh. ♫ [ominous] [Keylee] - Hey Jazz, what's up? - I think I want out. - What? What happened? Did they hurt you? - They hurt Asia. - Asia? What? Where is she? - I think she's dead. - What?! Dead? - I was on the phone, with Don. Ah, I think he was talking to Guido. And um... He said... 'Did you kill her for that?' I mean, those were his exact words. So I-I think Asia did something wrong, and Guido wacked her. - So, what now? Do we get up and leave? Do we finish the job? What? - I don't know. I mean, you're asking the wrong person. - I say we finish it. If, for nothing else, we finish it for Asia. - You're right. [sighs] But how do we do that? - We need to get some information on Don and his illegal activities. ♫ [ends] We need to get our hands on a ledger. Something, y'know, that shows how much money runs in and out of this place. [Jasmine] - It won't hurt Vinne, will it? [Keylee] - No. Speaking of Vinnie, you think he would help us? [Jasmine] God. I don't know. - Hey, Vinnie. - Hey Vinnie, what's going on? - Got a lot on my mind. Gotta do some thinking. [Jasmine] - Hmmm. Sorry to bother you but, Keylee and I have something important to discuss with you. If you don't mind. - What's it about? - Some things. - All right. You mind coming with me? You want to go to the beach or something just to get away from here for a bit? - Yeah let's get outta here. [Trixie] - I'm telling you it's not in the bedroom. He must've moved it to the front room. So, I'm gonna go check it out. And if it's there, we're back on schedule. - And if it's not? - Then we're fucked! - It's gonna be there. Tomorrow at one o'clock. ♫ [ominous] ♫ [ominous] [inaudible] ♫ [saxophone] - Man, I can't believe it. You guys were married to those guys that we killed? - Yep. - That's the thing when you kill people, you don't... You don't think that they have, like, families and wives. [Vinnie speaks in Italian] - What is that? - "Revenge of the wives." My dad must be getting soft, too. - Originally, I really wanted to hurt him. But now, I'd settle just to put him away. - Yeah, Vinnie. We don't want you. We just want your dad. I just don't know if I can turn on my dad. I just don't know. I don't know, just give me a little minute to think this over. All right? I just need a few minutes. [Jasmine chuckles] - How are you doing? - Alright. - You know Vinnie, you'd be in charge of everything. Everything your dad has would be yours. Everything. - I know but, I just... I still just can't turn him in. - Come on, Vinnie. If we don't get him, someone else will. - I guess he has been slipping up lately. - Yeah, it's better to have him in prison than, y'know, wind up in a grave. - It's more likely I'm saving my own life. Anyway, what do we need? - We need some evidence. Something to show that he broke the law. But not-y'know-not something that's gonna get him the gas chamber. - Alright. Well, he's got this ledger. Keeps all the financial dealings. All the money that comes in, all the money that goes out. Let's just say, he hasn't been honest to Uncle Sam. Anyway, he keeps it in a credenza in the front room. - That's perfect! Let's get it! - Wait you can't just go in there. - Why not? - What if he's in there? - You're right! - I know! Um, I'll keep your dad busy, while Keylee goes in and gets it. - All right. Sounds good. - Well, we better get going! - Aw. You know, I really wanted to enjoy the sun first. - Okay. Why don't you two stay here? Y'know? I'm kind of hungry, anyway. I'll go get a bite to eat. I'll find a way back. - How? - I have my ways. - I don't know about you, Keylee. Besides. I really wanna discuss some things with you. - I can't believe I'm turning in my dad. - I know you don't see this right now Vinnie, but you're doing the right thing. In the long run, you'll see. And besides... you should be thinking about something else for a while. ♫ [saxophone] ♫ ♫ [Tony] - Over there. Go over there! [Guido] - All right, fuck! Hey Tony. Think this is the Don's, huh?! Huh?! - Guido, stop fucking around, and find the book! - All right! - God damn it. Fuck! - Relax. [papers shuffle] [Tony] - Guido! Somebody's coming! - What are you doing here?! - Oh, I was uh... Well, just gonna ask you the same thing! I don't think the Don will be too happy about this! Let's just see! - We ain't supposed to be in here!! God damn it!! - All right! You're right, you're right. Let's uh... - We're taking her to Trixie, she'll tell us what to do! - That's a good idea. That's why you're... That's why I'm in charge! Right! [Trixie] - Whoa whoa! What is going on here? - Uhhhhh. - She caught us in here, that's what! - We'll have to kill her. But first, did you get the book? - I got it. - Ahhhh! Good! Let's send it to the police with a little note saying: "Here's some information that may be of some use." Hmmm? - When do we get to kill her? - Tonight. But first, let's get the book to the police. - All right! Let's go! - You got it. Take her out. - Vinnie! I don't know where Keylee is! - You think she went to the police? - We were planning to go together. - Y'think she went anyway and turned us in? - I mean, I don't know. I mean I wouldn't think that she would, but ya never know. - You never know. Shit! Y'know I knew I shouldn't have agreed to this. [mutters] Son of a bitch! - My ledger's gone! Somebody stole my fucking ledger! [Vinnie] - It's gone? - Yeah!! It's gone!! - Well how do you know someone took it dad? - It's not here, is it?! - Now dad, come on! - I'm finished! [panicked breaths] If that gets to the police I'm finished! I'll kill the motherfucker who did it! When I find out I'll kill the motherfucker! - Dad! Now, calm down! - Calm down?! Calm down?! It's not your goddamn neck in the noose! Now you find that son of a bitch and book before it leaves this house! - It's probably already gone. - I don't give a shit! Find it! - Uh, Don Carlo? - What!? - Um, I think I know who took it. - Who!? - Keylee. And, she's probably already on her way to the police right now. - Get Tony and Guido on her, right away! [singsong] - Ah-ah-ah! Tony and Guido work for me, now. So, if you want something from them, it'll have to be approved by me, first! - The fuck are you talking about? - I'm talking about your ledger. It's on its way to the IRS, and it looks like you're on your way to the big house, hm? - Trixie, you are nothing but a fucking whore. - Yeah, but I'm gonna be a rich whore! - I thought you said you knew this "Keylee" bitch? [Trixie scoffs, laughs] - Oh yeah, her. Well, she'll be dead by sundown. - What!? - Mhm! - You mean, she's not with you? - No, I only hire smart whores. - She's not a whore! - She looks like a whore... she acts like a whore... therefore, she must be a whore! - Trixie, why are you doing this? - Don Carlo by tomorrow, I'm gonna be the boss. And you guys are gonna be out. So, I don't really have to answer any more of your little questions! Hey, look! [laughs] I got a new line of work! You told me to start looking. I just thought it would take longer than it did. Maybe I'm smarter than I look. 'Cause this boss thing is easy. ♫ [ominous] Anyway, I gotta go! I have an empire to run! So I'll see you all later. - Hey, Trixie! [gunshot] ♫ - She had it coming. I guess I better get ready to go to prison. Oh, and Vinnie! You better find Tony and Guido. You probably have to get some new help. ♫ Why did you think it was Keylee? - I don't know! - How would she have known about the ledger? - Look dad, it wasn't her and she's probably already dead so it doesn't matter. [chuckles] - Yeah, I... I guess it doesn't matter. ♫ [ends] [sighs] Finally your turn, kid. Take good care of the family. Sometimes, that's all you've got. - He knows it was me. - How do you know? - I know he knows. I stabbed him right in the fucking back! - No, you didn't! Trixie did! And besides, you can make him proud by doing well with the business. - I guess you're right. - I know I am. And besides, you'll see... Oh my god, we forgot about Keylee! - You're right! Here! You ever used one of these before? - No. - Well, just point and shoot. - I don't know if I can. - Just don't look 'em in the eyes, all right? You go down the hall and I'll check downstairs. All right? - All right. - Cool. - Oh, and Vinnie? Be careful. ♫ [ominous] - Shit! [chatter] - They got to the ledger first! We gotta get out of here! [Jasmine] - Where are they?

Your brains will be on that back wall before you press the trigger. Put it down! I do not play games with people like you! Get the gun. - So, this is the bitch we've heard so much about? [Tony] - Yeah, this is Keylee! Look at that mouth. Look at it. Does wonders with that. Take her to the bathroom and find out. [Keylee] - Fuck you! - Way I see it, you don't have much of a choice, sweet pea. Get in the bathroom! - You know Trixie's dead? And Vinnie's gonna kill you, too! - Not if Guido gets to him first. - What about me? - You could do her right here. - Yeah, sounds good to me. - I guess I don't have much of a choice either! - Not the way I see it. [grunts] Oh, yeah! Oh man, I wish my bitch had a body like this! - Your bitch?! - Yeah, my old lady. Aw, fuck! - Oh, you like this? - Oh, yeah. - Well, how is that? - Oh, let's do this.

Untie em! - All right! - Untie 'em, Tony! - Whatever you say, boss. - You're fucking damn right! - Come on, let's get out of here. Come on, Keeley.

It's done. - You've got a lot of making up to do. - Whatever you say boss. ♫ [percussive guitar] - You were really gonna fucking shoot me. [Mayor] - Today... Don Carlo... the most dangerous man in the city, was arrested for tax evasion. This brings to an end... the reign of one of the most powerful mafia leaders of all time. He was responsible for the deaths of hundreds of people, which included many police officers. The arrest was made possible... by the work of three extraordinary citizens... who went undercover and risked their lives, with one of them making the ultimate sacrifice for the city's safety. Now, I would like to take this time to thank them, personally. - Thank you. - Thank you, sir. - And especially you, for all of your hard work. - It was my pleasure. - I might have a job for you, if you want. The city could use your talents. - Maybe, just maybe. - We'll talk. Take care of yourself. - You, too. - From every citizen in the city, thank you. [Jasmine] - Thank you. - Y'know, you guys did a great job. - You were the best and the most undercover cops we've ever had on the force. - Thank you! But... - But what? - It's just, we've lost a dear friend in the process. - We know. We can't bring her back... but we are gonna dedicate... a new wing of the police station in her name. - It'll house the drug and addiction department. - I think she would've liked that. - Well, we better let them get on with their lives. - Again, thank you. - Thank you. - Thank you. - Thank you. - Thanks, so much. - Thank you. - Thank you. - It was fun. I don't think I'd ever do it again. But, it was fun. ♫ [heavy bass guitar] - We've been through a lot these past few weeks. I guess this is it. - Yeah, I guess it is. - We'll keep in touch. - Yeah, don't be a stranger! I've got your number. I'll give you a call. - I've got yours. - Actually, you don't. 'Cause ah, I'm moving! - To where? - I'm moving in with him! ♫ [saxophone] [Keylee] - Vinnie? - Yeah, I think I'm in love. - I don't believe it. [Jasmine chuckles] - But um, you know? I just decided I don't want to be alone anymore. I can either wait 'til I'm ninety years old, and do nothing with my life, Or, y'know, I can take some chances while I'm still young. And um... I don't know. We'll see! Y'know, it's strange. Because, I feel like I've known him for a really long time. And y'know, I really love him. - Well, if you're happy, that's really all that matters. - I am. And uh... y'know... maybe I can try to get him into another line of work? I mean, we'll see. But, what about you? What are you gonna do? - Oh, I think I'll take the mayor up on his offer. Hell, I've already slept with the boss! - Keylee, you're gonna go places. I can tell. - Ah, I'll miss you. - You, too. ♫ [saxaphone synthwave] ♫ [ominous music]
