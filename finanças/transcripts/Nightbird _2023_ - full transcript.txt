We learned that an archeological artifact found in Australia shall be returned to us. - Hey, bestie. - Hey besties, what's up? - You're finally here. - Bestie, let's meet up later? Where? It is a traditional headhunter ax, or an ax used in hunting... - The usual place. - What time? this ax dates back its creation to the 1900's. It was stolen from the Philippines and sold illegally. A few years later... After end of shift. 4:00 p.m. Interpol tracked down the location of the artifact and in cooperation with the Australian government, Please. I'm sick of taking calls. the suspects were caught and the so-called headhunter ax was recovered. - Alright. See you. - Yay! See you Rach. as Filipinos, we should treasure and appreciate not only the present but also our past and beginnings. - Jesus, why do you keep following us? - Sir? Ma'am? - We told you, we didn't break that! - It was that way when we saw it. - No, sir. That's not true. - You're such a pest. We're your regular customers. What's wrong with you? You can't make me pay for something you broke. I don't care what you say-- But it wasn't us. Why do you keep blaming us? We didn't break it. That's how we saw it. It was already broken. - Ma'am, please don't do this. - We don't care. Ma'am, sir! You have to pay for this! You broke it! Ma'am, sir! Please wait! It's snapped, look. Are you messing with me? I told you, it was already like that! But sir, it was your wife who held this last. You liar! I didn't break that! Ma'am, I am not a liar. This was a good quality-- Call your manager! I want to speak to her! Go! Wait here, sir. You don't need to call the manager, babe. - Was it you who broke it? - Yeah. - You stupid little... how much was it? - 1800 pesos. Come on, let's go. I thought you said you'll wait for the manager? Who the hell are you? Nosy bitch! Sir, we welcome all tourists here with open hearts. And what we want in return is respect. Who do you think you are? I'm Rachel. - So? - I'm from here. Okay? And the way you insulted the saleslady back there, speaks of how lowly you think of us. Let's just go. Ouch! Oh my god, miss! Please stop! The lady had every right to demand you pay! And can you not be rude to everyone here? Have some manners! Just because you're not from here, doesn?t mean you can get away with everything! Please, stop fighting. We understand, miss. We'll pay. I'm sorry. We'll pay it. We're gonna pay for it. Ouch! They said they'll pay for it. - This is your fault. - Thank you, sir. We shouldn't have come here. Goddamnit. Sorry, babe. Oh, please. We're the locals. I can't believe he had the gall to be angry! As if! It was their fault. I swear, some people-- Sis, choose your battles. Take it easy! I know, but I just can't help it. I'm not generalizing, but some people are just downright disrespectful. Somebody has to look out for our own. They can't just treat people like that! Sis, are you an anthropologist or an activist? Sis, it's not about principles. It's about dignity. It's about being human. Sis, calm down. I gotta go. Bye. Okay. Who'd you beat up now? Nobody, uncle. Just some rude tourists. I swear to god, kid. Do we have everything from Mama's list? Yeah! I got everything. The line was crazy at Sir Inggo's! - Your mom and her shopping lists. - You know how she is. Hi, dear! Yes, Ma. Isn't it late for lunch? How are you? I'm good. Let's eat. Did you get everything I told you to get? Yes. The watermelons and the papaya soap? You can take a Pinoy out of the Philippines but you really can't take Philippines out of Pinoys, huh? What was that? Ma, there's a Filipino store in Melbourne, right? Too pricey! Fine, I'll shop here. But I won't bring much, okay? I don't wanna lug around all that food and soap. It's taking forever. I'm so excited to see you. Sleep it off over the weekend, Ma. I'll be there when you wake up. I can't wait to see you and hug you! - You know it's just for two years, right? - I'm so happy that you finally decided to leave Baguio. A lot can happen in two years, sweetie. Who knows, you might meet someone here. Ma, I'm going there for my Masters! And please, women aren't built to just stay home, have kids, and cook. I just want you to have a partner, sweetie! It's different when you have someone to come home to. Ma, I can take care of myself. Don't worry about me. I can't wait to have a grandchild and for you to have a partner! Marina? Marina! Here it is! I bought your favorite Baguio longganisa! Look! Say something to your daughter. She got herself in trouble again! What?! She's too hard-headed! You're at it again! - See you, Ma. Talk to you later. - You're just like your father! Wait out here for a bit, okay? I won't take long. Good morning! Good morning, sir. Yes, I called earlier. I was gonna ask about your rates. Please wait, sir. Thank you. Okay! Great, thanks. Thanks, sir. Come on, sweetie. I have a surprise for you. Really? I think you'll love it. You'll have loads of fun. Get in. Not in front of the kid! Papa! Papa! Papa! Papa! Papa! This was recovered mid-19th century and the axe used for wood carving and hunting made by our Ifugao communities. The axe, or as they call it, "lingua" reflects the value systems and traditions passed through generations. And we are thankful to the Australian government for returning it because it was stolen and it has been returned to its proper home now. This speaks for our cultural heritage between Philippines and Australia. A heritage that was formed and bonded by our respective ancestors. - Thank you, ma'am Rachel. - Thank you, ma'am Rachel. Thank you so much. If you need anything else, just message me, and we can discuss via Zoom. - Thanks. - Thank you. Oh, by the way, I just wanted to thank you for doing the interview today. I really believe you are the right resource person for doing the interview. Really appreciate it. Thank you, Rome. By the way, are you... are you pushing through with your trip to Melbourne? - Yes. - You're absolutely sure? Yeah. Why? I just hate this feeling, you know? What feeling? Of goodbyes. And it's you who's leaving, so? Rome, you know it's just a temporary one, right? Yeah, but still. I mean-- You do know there's social media, right? We can talk anytime. Besides, why don't you pursue your Guggenheim Fellowship? Well, honestly, I'm still thinking about it. We'll see how it goes. What's there to think about? It's a once in a lifetime opportunity so, go. I guess so. - I have an idea. - Yeah? Why don't I take you out for breakfast tomorrow? Just you and me. - Yeah, sure. - Yeah? Good idea. Ask Grace, too. Come on, now. Till now, do you still think of me that way? Don't be silly, Rome. You're like a brother to me. And besides, you mentored me. And to be honest, I thought you and Grace were already dating. I see your sweet posts about her. Well, honestly, we're getting to know each other, but you know, that's it. But... So are you dating or not? Honestly, you'll have to ask her. Don't worry, I'll hype you up. I'll tell her it's her loss if she lets you get away. Wow. Promise. - Deal. - I swear. No, it was twelve when we managed to get away-- Too bad, it could've been your gift to him. Right, then it turned into trauma. What a gift! - Hey, girls! - Hi! Hello! Are you feeling better? Yes, I'm good. Why? What happened? I'll tell you in a bit, okay? Is she on a rampage again? What else? Isn't she always? Must be a black-belter thing. She's so gutsy. You know why. She's always been that way. So, what happened? Who needed defending this time? Sis, we're not in university anymore. Girls, you don't leave your principles in school. You don't just run out of it, y'know? Forget what I said. Your fault for bringing it up. Well, sorry. Anyway, girls. Clear your schedule tonight. We have an important date. Am I included in this? No, just her... Come with me tonight, yeah? I meant all three of us, duh! Okay. Where? Double- I mean, we're going on a triple date. I set this up for you. Sorry, guys. I can't make it. You know I got tons to do, right? I haven't even packed everything. Come on, Rach. Just this last time before you go? It's literally our last night together. - She's right. - Come on! Let's have some fun, please? Okay, okay. - Here's your coffee, ma'am. - Thank you. Who are you trying to set us up with? I met someone. His name is Julius. He's pretty cool. Manila boy. He's with a couple of friends. Says they're site-viewing. For a business proposal or something. Monkey business, probably. Don't be such a downer. Girls, you know those types. They dig around for gold in Baguio put up their businesses, then exploit their workers, and as soon as they cash in, that's it. - Can you chill out? - We're left to clean up after them. You bet. Don't speak for everybody, bestie. Exactly. It's just a date! You know what, you really need to get laid. You're too upright! I swear, you need to get laid. - I don't need to water anything. - You're so gross! It's true, though! We're not getting any younger, are we? - Speak for yourself! - Speak for yourself! Yes, fine. It's always me, isn't it? But see, I really wanna find 'the one'! - The one? - So I can finally settle down, be a bride? Be a mother! You're the one to talk! As for me, I don't wanna get married yet. All I want is a new boyfriend. That's because you're going to the nunnery! Stop it! It's your own business, okay? Rach, what's wrong with having a partner in life? Just because you're looking for a daddy, not a boyfriend! Girls, will you be mad at me if I don't make it tonight? Of course! It's out last night out. Come on! Yeah. Please? Okay. What time? Yes! Beats. 7:00 p.m. - 7:00 p.m? - Yes! It's so early. So we can party harder, jeez. It's our last chance. As if she'll actually go home with anyone. - Right? She always backs out last minute. - True. Hey sister, shh. Have some respect. Don't undress her-- - I'll miss you girls. - We'll miss you more. Just stay here. Yeah. - Please? - Please? Just stay with us! - How could you leave us. - Yeah, just stay here. I'll really miss you. Look out for each other, okay? You look out for yourself. You should calm down and stop fighting everyone. No nun friends there. Pa, I'm going now. But I'll come back soon. Two years will go by really quickly. And... I left Uncle Oscar in charge of the house. Don't worry, Pa. I'll be fine. Besides. You taught me to be brave, to take care of myself and to survive. I'll never forget that, Pa. I love you very much. Oh my god! Finally! - Sorry, sis. - I've rotted in my seat waiting for you! We thought you were ditching us for your bed! Almost. Your bed isn't gonna make you happy! Look around! Plenty of boys and men in here. Sis, boys are just a bonus. I only care about being here with you. And please, stop making men as the center of everything! The world evolves, so you should, too! Hey, Rach? Count me out of that talk, alright? All I want right now is to get laid! - You foul-mouthed bitch! - That's not what I meant! You guys are so serious! We're gonna miss you. You're gonna make me cry. Anna, it's not like I'll be gone for good. Besides, we have messenger and viber, you know! Nothing beats having you with us in the flesh! Alright, for tonight, I will enjoy myself so let's go, guys! That's more like it. Hi! - Hello. - How's it going? Meet my friends Rachel, Hannah. Hello. Hello. Come meet my friends. Glad you could make it. Yeah, Rachel made us wait for so long. We couldn't wait to see you. Let's go! - This is Vince-- - Hi, ladies! Si Dennis. Rachel and Hannah. Nice to meet you. It's good! Super good! Do you come here often? Yeah, this is where we hang out. Really glad you guys showed up. Rachel held us up a bit. Let's go! Don't be a killjoy! - Cheers! - Cheers! It's really good, I promise. Both of us, come on! Okay. I never knew it was an actual thing. What do you mean? The only anthropologist I know is Indiana Jones. Correction, he's an archaelogist. - What? - Yes! It's the same thing! They're different fields but interrelated. You know what I mean? Nope! But okay. So does your work take you to the field a lot? Not always. It largely depends on getting a research grant. Why do you ask? Nothing, just curious. Did I crush your prejudice against my type of profession? Or were you expecting an old lady fiddling with bones and fossils all day? No, of course not. - A little bit. - Well, people and their expectations. What? What's that supposed to mean? Nah, I'm guilty of that, too, sometimes? About prejudice and expectations, you know? Especially towards outsiders. So just because I?m from Manila, means I'm a threat? Is that it? Okay. How many years have you been working? Two years here and abroad. - Abroad? - Yeah. Melbourne for Masterals. - Where? - Melbourne. So when are you leaving for Manila? Don't think about that. Important thing is, we're together right now. Slow down. I don't want my friends to see. Let them be. They're all adults. You want? I don?t want it. I love it. Don't forget later, then. Which one? Give me what I want. It depends. Come on. But I'm not yet ready. I'll take care of you, don't worry. I told you we'd have a great time. Right? - Wait, hang on. - What's the matter? What's the matter? Everyone's looking. - That's alright, silly. - You're too fast. Huh? I'm too fast? Yeah. Okay. It's fine, actually. May I ask, how old are you again? I'm 18. Wow! 18. Wow! We're the same age, then. Really now? You know, I had my first sexual experience when I was 18. You're unbelievable. I'm unbelievable. Wow. I had my first kiss when I was 21. Hang on, I thought you were 18? Now you're 21. - Which is it? - Sorry. - So how old are you really? - Truth is, I'm 23. - Yeah. - Well, you don't look 23 for me. I'm feeling shy, actually. Don't be. We're all here to enjoy ourselves. Okay? Cheers? Engineer or architect? Why? Is it because of the way I look? - Yeah. - And I'm the prejudiced one? - Also an R.K. - R.K.? Okay, wait. Aspiring architect- you got that right. But R.K., no. I'm not a rich kid. My parents, sure. They're rich. Yeah, right. But I'm not. Yeah, right. We gotta work hard to earn things, right? Money, especially. I thought you were a rich kid. Your friends certainly look like they are. They're rich kids, alright. For sure. Especially that one. They're my college friends. Cool people but super rowdy. This one's the naughtiest. This one's the naughtiest. Look at his face-- Hear that? That beat. Hey guys, let's go! Let's dance! Come on! Guys!

I was just waiting for you. You're the flaky one. You wanna fly? How? Like a ghost? A bird? - Someone might come in. What's that? - Who cares. This will calm you down. You first. Sure. See? Nothing happened to me. Why'd you waste that? - Why did you spit it out? - It's bitter! The hell is that? Of course it's bitter. It's a tablet. You can't be in here. I know. Jealous bitch. I'll pull your hair. What's going on here? Men aren't allowed here. - I know. - This is the ladies' room, sir. Go! I told you you can't be here. Go on, get out of here! You cool? Can you handle him? Let's go! Let's go! Are you sure? He's not even drunk yet! You ain't seen nothing yet. You want a drink? You okay? - Yeah. - You okay? - Yeah. - Sure? Let me get your drink.
