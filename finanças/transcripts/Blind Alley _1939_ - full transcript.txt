[♪♪♪] [♪♪♪] So you see, most people don't know how abnormal they are. Most people don't know they're abnormal. No, gentlemen, there's no way of knowing. That's been my purpose in today's lecture, to prove to you that the difference between the normal mind and the abnormal is so slight, the threads supporting them so delicate, it would take an extremely acute perception to distinguish between the two. Furthermore, abnormality is more or less relative to the person, time and place. For instance, the other day, I was walking along the corridor. I saw a student. I could tell you his name, but I think perhaps I'd better not. He was singing at the top of his voice and performing gyrations in a most fantastic manner. He was shaking his forefinger in midair while his body was possessed by the most incredible contortions. [STUDENTS LAUGHING] At first, I thought the student had been seized by a fit, but upon questioning another observer, I found it was nothing more than an exhibition of a new song and dance called the jitterbug jive. [ALL LAUGHING] Now, I know enough about American song and dance to accept as perfectly normal the performing of the jitterbug jive. But if some visiting professor from, let's say Norway, were to run into the same student, what would he think? I'm sure you know the answer. [STUDENTS CHUCKLE] Now, for some more examples. When the first man crossed the Atlantic, it would have been thought madness if he hadn't crossed safely. But once he landed, however, he was a fearless, courageous pioneer. Uh... If a Chinese girl were to see some of the so-called hats of our young American girls, she certainly would say "cuckoo", wouldn't she? [STUDENTS LAUGH] And what would our young American girls say about her and her hats? The same thing. Or let's take the most common form of temporary insanity known to man. It's ordinary name is love. Love? You mean like...? [ALL LAUGH] SHELBY: Exactly. When one falls in love, there's a definite suspension of his powers of rationalization. For instance, Holmes, have you been eating and sleeping well lately? And do you find you're not doing as good work as you might? [ALL LAUGH] No. The lover exhibits, all in all, many of the same symptoms as the acute neurotic. For instance, Holmes, if I were to ask you why you're in love with Miss Such-and-Such, what would you answer? Uh, I... I don't know. [ALL LAUGHING] You see, uh... Well, I mean... That is... You... Look, you see... There you are. He's lost his reason. He's mad. [ALL LAUGHING] Well, Professor Shelby, I was thinking perhaps... [BELL RINGING] Just try and hold that thought till next week. That's all for today, gentlemen. [CHATTERING INDISTINCTLY] MAN 1: So long, Fred. MAN 2: Have a good trip. MAN 3: Congratulations. FRED: Thanks, fellas. MAN 4: So long, Fred. [CHATTERING INDISTINCTLY] Fred. Yes, sir? For someone who's about to start his professional career in a few days, you're a very sad-looking young man. Anything wrong? Well, I suppose it's just I hate going away. I sort of like being here with you. I sort of like having you too, but if Dr. Hobbs wants you, you belong with him. After all, he selected you from 300 candidates. I know it's a great opportunity to be his assistant. Then you'd better not turn it down, or I might be tempted to psychoanalyze you. I guess you're right. Well, I've got a million things to do. Wait. Say hello to Mrs. Shelby and Davy. They're over here in my office. Here? Oh, I'd love to. You studying to be a psychologist too, Davy? No, Uncle Fred. I wanna be an animal trainer. Mrs. Shelby. Hello. I didn't expect to see you until tonight. Well, don't let this stop you from coming. I'll be over after I have dinner with Mother. Davy and I have to continue Alice in Wonderland. We're up to the best part. I'll finish it for you after Uncle Fred is gone. I have to run along. We all have to go. We'll be expecting you after dinner. Will you take me to the car, Uncle Fred? Sure. Come along. Piggyback, please? Oh, no. I'm afraid we have to be more dignified than that. After all, this is a university. Aw. Oh, but now you pretend that you're a professor like your dad. Now, let's see you walk down the hall like Dr. Shelby Jr. Brilliant boy. He'll go far. You know, there's something unfair about it. Unfair about what? You work four years developing a student and then lose him to the world. It's like marrying off one's son. But I'm glad he's getting this opportunity with Dr. Hobbs. Davy will miss him terribly. But as you say... What are you taking all that home for? You know, we have guests over the weekend. Guests? Who? Linda and George Curtis. Oh. What about Holbrook? Don't tell me Linda's given him back to the Indians? No. He's coming, all right. I thought so. I do wish Linda wouldn't bring him to our house too often. Why? Oh, I don't know. It doesn't seem very discreet. Oh, nonsense. George Curtis knows all about it. You're taking it a lot more seriously than he does. I'm afraid it's more serious than you think. You're getting an obsession about it. Linda's a high-spirited young girl married to a settled conservative. Holbrook has a certain romantic appeal for her. After all, you must admit that George Curtis is no Casanova. Yes, but George loves Linda. And Linda loves George. She just misses a certain romance, that's all. It's far better she gets it this way, through a harmless flirtation than by rebelling against her husband. That really would be serious. This way, no one's affected. And in the end, Linda will discover that one George Curtis is worth a half a dozen Holbrooks. How long are you gonna be away, Uncle Fred? Oh, for a long time, I guess. Why do you have to be away for so long? Heh. Well, I wanna be a smart man. Can't you be smart here? [CHUCKLES] My daddy's smart here, and I'm smart too. Look, I can read. K-I-L-L-E-R. What's that mean, Uncle Fred? Let's see that, Davy. Have any trouble? Nah. It worked like a charm. [CHUCKLES] Didn't it, warden? Do like I told you? Don't I always? Sure, you're okay. How about Frankie and the boat? [MOUTHS]What about him? Aah. We'll make the lake after dark and wait there till he comes. Where do we hide? Under the water? There's a house on the lake. We'll hang around there till Frankie gets across. Good. There's people in it. - Huh? Nothing to worry about. Just a man, his wife and kid. Well, I guess it's okay. Whose house is it? Who lives there? Some college professor. His name's Shelby. Hey, Hal, what about his Nibs here? That's right. Yeah, we don't need him anymore. Well, warden, here's where you get off. Stop the car. So long, warden. Thanks for the help. [GUNSHOT] [PIANO PLAYING] Lucky you don't have to earn your living as a dancer, Tony. Can I help it if Mr. Chopin didn't write his waltzes for waltzers? I think you dance divinely. There, you see? I'm a tap dancer too. [STOMPING] Shh. You'll awaken Davy. Don't worry about the noise, Linda. Davy won't shut his eyes until Fred gets here. Ready? Say, Tony, what do you think of this? Thanks, pal. Excuse me. [LINDA PLAYING PIANO] [GASPS] None of that. Somebody screamed. Yes, it seemed to come from... Shut up. Get up, both of you. Get in there. Men aren't born that way, George. There's something in his background, his early environment, that's given him a queer, twisted way of thinking. That's what makes Hal Wilson the killer he is today. BUCK: Stick them up. Don't move. George! Never mind him. Get up against that wall. Come on, you too. AGNES: Dr. Shelby. MARY: Get over there. BUCK: Face the wall. Turn around. The baby... Okay, frisk 'em. What is this? HAL: Who wants to know? This all of them? Yeah. You Shelby? Yes. You're Hal Wilson. Smart guy. College professor, huh? That's right. I teach at the university of... Nobody cares what you do. Who are all these people? This is Mrs. Shelby, my wife. These are weekend guests and our help. Let me see your faces. Turn around, all of you, and put your hands down. You a teacher too? I'm a businessman. [SCOFFS] What's your line? I'm a writer. Reporter? No, I write books. Teachers, writers, screwballs. This your wife? No. Any more servants around? Never mind him. Speak up for yourself. No. Expecting any more company tonight? No. Just a minute, dear. One of my pupils is leaving town tonight. He's driving out to say goodbye to us. Yeah? I can phone him and tell him not to come. Sure, and tip him off there's something wrong here, huh? What if he walks into all this? That's his tough luck. Listen, you... Take it easy. Okay, Buck. What's eating you, fella? I wanna know what this is about. Is that so? You're making a getaway. We know that. But where do we come in? If this is a holdup, take what you want and get out. Don't stay here bullying women. Now, shut up and stay shut! When I want any advice, I'll ask for it, see? Now, get this, all of you. I am making a getaway, across that lake. I'm waiting here for a boat to pick me up. It may take one hour, it may take two. But it's coming, and until it does, I'm staying. Now, if you're all quiet and do like I tell you, there won't be no trouble, see? But if you get out of line... Now get this, wise guy. ...if anybody makes a false move, they're gonna get it, understand? Mommy, is that Uncle Fred? Davy. That's my son. You said you got everyone. Oh, he's only a kid. Wilson... Shut up. Hal, please. Shut up, I said. You said I could come down when Uncle Fred got here. I know, dear. Come here, kid. Is that man with Uncle Fred? Let that kid go. Oh, look, Mommy. Does that shoot real bullets? Huh? Yeah, sure. Shoot something. What? I got a target upstairs. I'll go get it. Davy. Let the boy go to bed, Wilson. Aw, I want him to shoot. Let's get organized here. Where can I see the lake from? Here? No, upstairs. From the guestroom. And the road? Upstairs too. What room? Nursery. Right. Now, this is it. Nick, Buck, take this mob upstairs, split them up between the guestroom and the nursery. Professor, you stay down here with me. Come on, get going. Move. You too. Mary, take these kitchen mechanics out and rustle up some grub. Come on. Take your filthy hands off me. Oh, yeah? Hold it a minute, Buck. Come back. Take these dames down to the cellar. Tie them up. There's enough women here as it is. BUCK: Come on, loudmouth. MAN [OVER RADIO]: Calling all cars assigned to Lake District. Calling all cars assigned to Lake District. Wilson's car reported seen earlier in the evening. Headed for lake. Calling Car 39. Calling Car 39. Call headquarters at once. That's all. What's wrong, officer? Let's see your driver's license. Oh, looking for Hal Wilson, eh? You guessed it. Where you heading? For Dr. Shelby's at the lake front. Is Wilson supposed to be around here? He was heading this way. Okay. If I see Wilson, I'll bring him back in my rumble seat. Yeah, you do that. What time is it? SHELBY: Eight forty-five. Say, what's eating you? Nothing. That's what I mean. You ain't got the jitters like everyone else. I'm just taking you at your word, Wilson. My word? You said you were waiting for a boat. If we behaved ourselves, nothing would happen to us. I'm behaving myself. Where do you want it? Oh, put it anywhere. On the piano's all right. What's keeping Frankie with that boat? Quit worrying. He'll be along. It's early yet. Yeah. I didn't expect him much before 10:00. He had to wait till dark. Eat some... I don't want nothing. You said you was hungry. Now eat. It's gonna be a long night. I'll take something up to Nick and Buck. Well, what you staring at? Ain't you never seen a guy eat before? I'm sorry, Wilson. You see, you interest me. I can't help thinking of you as a case. What do you mean a "case"? A patient. I'm a doctor, you know. Oh, I thought you said you was a teacher. I'm both. I teach psychology. You're a screwball. There's one thing puzzling me. That's too bad. Why didn't you lock us all up in the cellar? Heh. You'd have been a great help in this racket. Suppose the cops come or someone else. I wanna have you all handy so everything looks hunky-dory, see. Just you and the folks. That's fine organization, Wilson. Good tactics. You'd go far in the Army. You'd be a general in no time. Aw, you talk too much. Mind if I do some work? Work? I want to read some case histories I brought home. They're over there in my briefcase. Okay, go ahead. Hey, keep away from there. What are you trying to do? My briefcase is in there. Huh? Thanks. Anytime you want anything, just ask for it. "There was a table set out under a tree in front of the house, and the March Hare and the Hatter were having tea at it: a Dormouse was sitting between them, fast asleep, and the other two were using it as a cushion, resting their elbows on it, and talking over its head. Very uncomfortable for the Dormouse, thought Alice, only, as it's asleep, I suppose it doesn't mind." Hey, be careful there. That's my toy. Be quiet, Davy. I don't care. He can't be... Shut your trap, kid, and go to sleep. Mommy. Lie down, Davy. NICK: Drop it. Mommy. Get back in that room. Try anything like that again, and I'll push your kid's face in. Hey, what's this gadget? It's a game called chess. Yeah? [CHUCKLES] What's this, Seabiscuit? They call that a knight. It's very important if you know how to use it properly. Hurt your hand? Keep your nose clean, professor. I'm sorry. Huh? NICK: Hey, Hal. Yeah? A car coming. Heading for this house? Yeah. Slowing down to turn in the driveway. Bring everyone down excepting the kid. Mary. Get upstairs, look after the kid. Make it snappy. Right. Must be the boy I told you was coming. Move. All right, over by the fireplace, all of you. Hurry up. Buck, take the kitchen. Nick, in the dining room. Now, get this, all of you. Act natural, as if nothing had happened. We'll be watching you, see? [KNOCKS ON DOOR] Remember what I told you now. Good evening, Dr. Shelby. Am I too late? Has Davy gone to bed? Come in, Fred. Thank you. Well, my trunk's packed and down at the station. This is my last stop. Good evening, Mrs. Shelby. Hello, Fred. I brought something for Davy. Sort of a going-away present. How nice of you. Well, I'd like to give it to him myself, say goodbye, you know. I haven't met your guests, Dr. Shelby. Oh, I'm sorry, Fred. Mr. and Mrs. Curtis, Mr. Holbrook, Mr. Fred Landis... Hello, Fred. How do you do? ...my star pupil. Is there anything wrong, doctor? Am I intruding? No, of course not. Well, heh, you asked me to come. Did you forget? You're always welcome here, Fred. You know that. It's just... We were telling ghost stories when you arrived. Oh, heh, heh! And telling them so well you frightened yourselves, eh? Yes, that's right. This is the night for weird stories. I was stopped on my way out here. Stopped? A holdup? No. The police. You see, they've barricaded all the roads. They're looking for Hal Wilson. The killer who broke jail today. They know Wilson's around this neighborhood? What time's your train leaving? Well, I... What about Davy? May I run up and say goodbye to him now? I'm sure he must be asleep by now. Couldn't I just tell him? But he'll be so disappointed, doctor, and well, so will I. Now, I'll only stay with him a minute. Fred, I don't want you to go upstairs. There is something wrong here. What's the matter, doctor? It's Davy. HAL: That's far enough. Get back here. What are you listening to? Shut up, kid. Go to sleep. Why don't you go to sleep? Yeah. Why don't I? You're pretty brave with that gun. Why you... Wait a minute. You think you're a hero. Well, I think you're yellow. Yellow as they come. What would you do if I didn't have the gun? Beat the daylights out of you. Give me a crack at him. SHELBY: Stop it. Don't worry. I'm itching to go to work on these heroes. Hal. Okay, Buck, give me your gun. Don't let them do this. What's the matter? This your boyfriend? He asked for it, didn't he? Get back. Give him some room. That kid has got spunk. I wish I could help him. He's a fool. [SCOFFS] [GASPING] You're next, Wilson. Put down your gun. [GUNSHOT] [FRED THUDS] REPORTER [ON RADIO]: Since early today, Hal Wilson has blazed a trail of... ...cold-blooded murder so brutal and fiendish, that the whole nation stands aghast. In breaking out, this bad man killed two guards, and took along as a shield Warden Cass. The hunt for him continues with undiminished activity. This afternoon, special agents arrived from Washington. Federal authorities joined with state and local police in the hunt. Federal Bureau of Investigation... Hey, Hal! Are you listening to the radio? Shut up! REPORTER:...Warden Cass. He carried him across the state line before he murdered him. There's no telling what this killer will do next. I can't go on with this, Tony. I can't. Quiet, dear. Hey, what time is it? Twelve-thirty. I'm gonna stop him. I don't understand. He murdered Fred, but I can see that he doesn't kill anyone else. I'm gonna destroy him. Take his brain apart and show him the pieces. Tony. It's the only weapon I have. But Davy, what if he...? I've thought of him. But I'm thinking of Fred too. And all the others who will have to die if Wilson leaves this house. I'm going up to Davy. Hey, where do you think you're going? Upstairs to my son. Did I say you could? I want to be with my son. Sit down. Doris. Say, listen, sister. I ain't playing games. Go back and sit down and shut up. Doris, please. All right, go on upstairs. I've got enough to worry about. Try and get some rest, dear. [SOBBING] It ain't finished yet. There are still some of both kinds left. That isn't checkers, Wilson. It's chess. Aw, kid's stuff. Why don't you play with trains? That's a game for intelligent people. People like you and me. Besides, there's nothing I know that'll relax you more. If you're worried or overstrained... The way you are now. ...there's nothing quite so restful. You have to concentrate. Shut everything else from your mind. Is that why you was playing just now? Possibly. You was pretty mad because I killed the kid? I was upset. But you ain't now? No. After all, you didn't harm Landis. Death is only an escape of sorts. What do you mean "escape"? Aw, more of that screwball talk. Not screwball, Wilson, just different talk. And all these books. Say, what is your job, anyhow? First you're a doctor, then a professor, and always a screwball. It's just the reverse, Wilson. I cure screwballs. You mean you're a bug doctor? I'm the fellow that keeps people from going bugs. I don't get you. I'm what they call a psychiatrist. I practice psychology. I cure sick minds by psychoanalysis. What do you give them? Castor oil? I'll show you. Pull up a chair. Nah. I'll stay like I am. Who's that? It could be anybody. Let's say it's you. This is where you do your thinking. All the everyday stuff. Eating, smoking, planning getaways. They call this the conscious mind. You know everything that goes on up here. Now, this part here is called the unconscious or subconscious mind. You don't know anything about this part down here. What's more, the upper part, the conscious, absolutely refuses to have anything to do with the lower part if it can possibly help it. So to stop anything from pushing through, the conscious builds a sort of a wall across here. We call that the censor band. Aw, that don't make sense. Sounds screwy to me. Hey, look. Supposing them two parts was in a guy's bean, see, why don't the top dingus know what's in the bottom? Because it doesn't want to. It's afraid of what's in the lower part. Afraid? - The lower part is full of things that the top half wants to forget. Things you pushed into the lower part when you were a child because they frightened you. Made you remember something you wanted to forget, things that make you feel you're not such a big shot after all. So what? That's what makes my job necessary. Sometimes the censor band doesn't do its work properly. Thoughts and ideas creep into the top half and raise Cain. You mean it might drive a guy nutty? Sometimes. Eh... They can do other things too. They can even affect your body. What you giving me, professor? Like your fingers, for instance. I told you to lay off my fingers, didn't I? They was hurt, see? In an auto wreck. No they weren't, Wilson. That wasn't caused by any accident. They're paralyzed. Shut up, do you hear? What's the time? One fifteen. Would it be asking too much...? Huh? A match... Go on, go away, go away. Pleasant fellow. Can't say I enjoy having my bedroom crowded with tourists. George. How can you be so facetious at a time like this? I couldn't be serious when my life is threatened by a charming baboon. Just a minute... Don't pay attention to Curtis. He has a habit of saying silly things he doesn't mean. I wonder how silly I sound compared to the babblings of our romantic fellows. Look here, Curtis... Stop it, George. Haven't we enough trouble without you two fighting? I'm merely making observations. This is the first since I've known Dick that he isn't eager to be the center of attention. At a time like this, I don't find your stupid kind of humor admirable. If that's the way you're gonna spend the night, I'm going to stay with Doris. Linda. Take it easy, Miss America. You'll do all your visiting... George! Just a minute. Maybe a little lead will keep you all quiet. You've got us all in danger. A gunshot might attract the curious at 1:30 in the morning. One thirty? Where's that guy? One thirty. Make yourself comfortable, my dear. Looks like we should be here some time. How's that? Wrong again. You can't do that. Aah. Who thought of that screwy game, anyhow? That's a queer trick you have, Wilson. What do you mean? What trick? Calling everything and everybody you don't understand screwy or screwball. You talk too much. [WHISTLING] See anything yet? Nothing. What do you think about Frankie? Don't worry. He'll get here. Tell Mary I want her. Stay upstairs with the dame and the kid. You don't suppose nothing could've happened to that boat? Beat it. Hal? Is anything wrong? Nah, just punch-drunk, that's all. You ought to sleep, kid. Yeah. That's why I sent for you. I want you to keep tabs on the professor here. Sure. HAL: Everything all right upstairs? MARY: Sure. That's no way to rest. There. Go to sleep. You'll stick around now? You know I will. Go to sleep. Stay there where I can watch you, professor. [♪♪♪] [♪♪♪] Bad dreams. Nervous exhaustion. Same dream he's always having. It scares him. Scares him? That doesn't sound like Wilson. You'd be scared too if you kept dreaming the same thing over since you was a kid. It keeps coming to him regular. He don't even wanna go to sleep sometimes. Funny too, when he tells it to you. It don't seem like nothing. Oh, it's queer, all right, but nothing to get so scared about. He says it always starts with him walking alone. [♪♪♪] MARY: All of a sudden, it starts to rain. Sheets of rain, drops as big as half dollars. He tries to run away from it, then, right ahead of him, it starts to rain too. No matter where he turns, the rain keeps coming at him. He can't get away from it. And then, without knowing how he got there, he's under an umbrella. He hides under it 'cause he knows he can't let any of those drops touch him. But there's a hole in the umbrella. And some of the drops keep coming through. Hal keeps ducking and dodging, trying to get out of the way. But he knows they'll get him soon if he don't do something to stop up the hole. He's scared stiff, see? But he raises his arm. He's gonna try and stop the drops with his hand. Something's gonna happen. He knows that. But he can't keep his hand there 'cause it hurts him. This...this pain in his hand makes him wanna get out from under the umbrella and run blind like some animal, he says. Only he can't. 'Cause when he starts to get out, he finds bars. All around the umbrella, iron bars have sprung up, just like in prison. And he can't get out. He's trapped. That's it. Sounds kind of silly, don't it? It isn't silly. Wilson's dream has a very definite meaning. Close association with something in his early life. NICK: Hal. Hey, Hal! Quiet. Hal's asleep. What's wrong? There's a car coming down the road. I'll wake him up. Hal. Hal. Wake up. Mm. Hal, wake up. Wake up. Huh? Take it easy, kid. There's a car coming. It's slowing down. I think it's gonna stop. Mary, upstairs with the dame and kid. Buck, stay there. Keep that mob quiet. You, cover from the kitchen. Throw me that rifle. All right, professor. Whoever it is, get rid of them, and do it right. No tricks, or Mary'll know what to do. [KNOCKS ON DOOR] Dr. Shelby? That's right. What's the trouble? Sorry to bother you so late, but we're just checking up. Checking up? What for? OFFICER: You heard about Hal Wilson breaking jail? Hal Wilson? Oh, yes, I think I remember reading something in the papers about him. They think he's in this neighborhood. Really? Yes. We're making a house-to-house checkup. Does this face on the lake, doctor? Yes, we're right on the shore. Can you see it from the living room here? Yes, you can. JOE: Haven't heard or seen anything out of the ordinary, have you? SHELBY: No, not a thing. I'm afraid we haven't any criminals for you. Curtis. Not a peep out of you, or I'll finish him. OFFICER: Come on, Joe. Let's get going. SHELBY: Have a drink before you go? Oh, no thanks, doc. Not on duty. SHELBY: I hope you get him. I hope so too. Good night. Sorry to have bothered you. It's all right. Well, what are you looking at? You waiting for a boat too? There's a storm coming up. Rain. So what? Supposing it does rain, what of it? Rain seems to bother you, Wilson. Shut up. I once had a patient who had a curious dread of rain. He used to dream about it. Yeah? He must've been a screwba... Aw, you give me the itch. He thought he was going mad, but I fixed him up, all right. What do you mean "fixed him up"? I found out what he was really dreaming about, what the rain really meant in his nightmares. He was all right after that. Aah, you... There's a meaning to nightmares, you know, Wilson. They're symbols of something in the subconscious mind, the lower part of that sketch I drew for you. Go on, talk your head off. Everything all right upstairs? Yeah. But no sign of the boat. Wait'll that Frankie gets here, keeping me waiting like this. What's he gabbing about? Aah, some guff about nightmares. He thinks he's a swami fortune-teller. I was talking about people who have the same terrifying dream over and over. Unless they go to a psychiatrist, a mind doctor, like me, they sometimes end up by going insane. [GUN THUDS] You mean if they was to come to you, you could fix 'em up? In some cases, yes. Suppose... Suppose they wasn't batty, though. Just... Just plain folks who keep having the same nightmare over and over? You couldn't do nothing about that? Lay off, will you? You'll get him talking again. But I'm kind of interested. Aah. Do you have recurrent nightmares? Me? Of course not. But I... I got a cousin who does. Keeps dreaming the same thing night after night. Think you could help him? Any psychiatrist could undoubtedly help him, if your cousin really wants to be helped. What sort of nightmares does your cousin have? It's about... Pipe down. It's me she's talking about. Really? Yeah. I'd like to hear about it. Well, it's like this, see. I... Aw, forget it. Why don't you tell him, Hal? Maybe he can help you. Hey, lookit. You mean... You mean you could fix it so I don't have that dream no more? Probably, if you're completely frank. What do you mean? You'd have to answer some questions that might seem screwy to you. But if you didn't answer them, there's nothing I can do to help you. Go on. I can take it if you can. First, describe the nightmare. Well, it's been going on ever since I was a kid, see? The same thing, night after night. I... Go on, scram, will you? Okay, boy. See how them kitchen mechanics is doing down in the cellar. [SOBBING] How is it now? It's getting looser, but for goodness' sake, stop sniveling. I can't help it. I'm too frightened. Afraid of them? If my hands were free, I'd teach them a lesson they wouldn't forget the rest of their... Everything under control, girls? I'm glad you two ain't trying any funny stuff. How long do you think you'll keep us here? What's the matter? Don't you like it here? You just wait. You'll get what you deserve. The government knows what to do with people like you. Try and act like a lady, even if it hurts. I'm sensitive, and I don't like your attitude. One more word out of you and... You'll do what? [GASPS] [SIGHS] [WHIMPERS] Stop your whining or I'll have to gag you, and it don't taste good. Just wait'll I get out of here. I'll show them. SHELBY: What about your father? Tell me what you remember about him. He was no good, an all-time heel. Ain't got nothing to do with this. He still alive? Nah. Kicked off when I was a kid. How old were you when he died? How'd I know? I was a kid, I told you. Ain't you got nothing to say? It's no use, Wilson. I can't do anything for anyone without cooperation. Who ain't cooperating? What did your father do? His work? Ain't I told you? He was a heel. He didn't do nothing, except hang around racetracks and small-time fights, and whale the daylights out of me. Did he mistreat your mother too? Not him. They was like two lovebirds together, him and the old woman. Is your mother still alive? Nah, cashed in two years ago. Did she die peacefully? Yeah. Say, what's she gotta do with all this? She's dead. I hated the sight of her. Leave her out of it. I don't wanna talk about her. Are you sure you hated her? Yes, I hated her! Well, maybe when I was a kid, I used to like it, before the old man come home and started using me as a punching bag. Was she fond of you? Yeah, I guess so. She was always making over me. Making over you? Yeah, kissing me, stroking me, all that sort of thing. You said your father was away when you were small? Yeah. It was after he came back that your mother stopped making over you? Yeah, that's right Every time he was around, she had no use for me. And every time I tried to... Aah, this don't make no sense. What's all this got to do with my dreaming about rain? All right, go on. Ask me some more questions. When were you first afraid you were going mad? One more crack like that... It won't help to lose your temper, Wilson. Aw, I was nutty to talk to you in the first place. That book fascinates you, Wilson. Do you know how many times you've looked at it? So what? It was your interest in that book that made me realize your constant fear of madness. Pulling that trigger won't solve your problem, Wilson. George, darling, you should lie down again. I'm all right, my dear. Thanks. What time is it? It's, uh... It's almost 3:00. We seem to be breaking the endurance record for an unpleasant situation. It wouldn't be if you didn't go out of your way to make trouble. I didn't have to go very far. You should rest. Talking makes you weak. Weak? If he talks any more, he'll be sick. Now, look here, although you're an unpleasant character... Now, just a moment. Can't we discuss this rationally? Discuss what? I'm a practical man. At times, perhaps too practical. Now, it's my job to deal in stocks and bonds, But it might be more interesting to deal in human lives. Mine for instance, and my wife's and her constant companion. What's the gag? I want our freedom. For us and every member of this house. I'm willing to pay for it, anything you like. What about it? Curtis, don't provoke him again. You stay out of this. Ask him again, George. Maybe he'll do it. So you want your freedom. Yes. So do we. First, we wanna get away, then maybe someday later we'll get together and do business. I think I'll stick to stocks and bonds. How's the patient? Is he behaving? He's talking business. He wants to make a deal. He thinks his life is worth money. What did he offer? Two bucks? What kind of woman are you anyway? How can you stand there, your hands covered with blood and joke about the danger you've put us in. You're the lowest creature I've ever seen. What's so hot about you? Curtis, will you please ask Linda to stop? Now, girls, don't you two start anything. You don't look to me like no angel from heaven. You ought to be ashamed of yourself. You're so mean and miserable, I feel sorry for you. Ah, don't waste your pity on me. It don't take much to see the kind of life you lead. Mine ain't so bad. I've got Hal, and that's all I want, see? I've been with him now for eight years. Eight years, I've been waiting for him in and out of prisons. Sure, I know, it ain't a pretty life, but that's the life he picked, and whatever's his is mine. And I ain't never run out on him, see? And what's more, I ain't never wanted to. There's a great deal in what she says. Loyalty's a rare virtue in this 20th century. Definitely not enough of it around. Still, it can be developed. Where was your loyalty? Endangering your wife's safety through selfish bravado. Are you trying to say that you were concerned for me? Well, I... Don't bother. You're very unconvincing. By the time you're finished worrying about your own frightened life, it's too late for anyone else. Linda... Don't say anything. That's a good idea. From now on, let nobody say nothing. You're scared. Who is? I ain't never been scared in my life, see? Yes, you have. You're scared right now. Frightened as a child. It's that nightmare, I'm telling you. If I could sleep right, my head'd be right. That's all it is. You're like a man running down a blind alley in the dark, running away from something you refuse to remember. What is it, man? What is it? I don't know, I'm telling you. It's nothing. What's the matter? What's he been saying? Leave me alone. What's this got to do with having nightmares? Everything. You gotta snap out of this. It's after 3, no sign of Frankie. What if the boat don't come till morning? You gotta make plans. Aw, lay off. I'll take care of all that later. Your nightmare is caused by something that happened when you were a child, something you're ashamed of, something you don't want to remember. So you locked it away in your unconscious. To make sure it doesn't get out, you placed a special guard over it. The censor band. All day, he keeps the old memory down there, but when night comes and you go to sleep, the censor gets tired and he relaxes too. Hal, make him stop. Now, your old memory sees its chance. He knows he can't get by the censor in his true colors, so he disguises himself and slips out into your mind as a dream. Hal, don't listen. He's trying to... - Shut up. Your dream is just a masquerade party. Every thought wears a false face. The rain in your dream is a symbol for something else. So's the umbrella and the bars around the umbrella. If we can just find out what those symbols stand for, we'll know what your dream means. Then you'll never dream it again for the rest of your life. What do you want me to do? What do you want me to do? I want you to think. I want to find out what happened when you were a child. Nothing. Why don't you leave me alone? You shut your trap and leave him alone. Kid, it's all right. Maybe I can help you think. You're heading for trouble. I'm warning you. Perhaps the memory that causes your dream has something to do with your family. Your mother maybe? We've been through all that. We're finished with her. Oh, no. You never will be. She never meant nothing to me when she was alive. She's the only woman you ever loved. All the other women were only substitutes for her. What are you talking about? Since your mother's death, no woman has meant anything to you as herself. I warned you. You shut your trap. It's true, isn't it? One woman means no more to you than another. Why, you... Here, give me that. Now, get out! [GASPS, CRIES] I was right, wasn't I? It was your mother. There was nothing, see? There was something. There must have been. There was nothing, I tell you. I don't remember. Hey, Mary. I wanna ask you something. Yeah? Well, save it. Wait a minute. I wanna know what Hal's up to. What's the matter? You losing your nerve? I'm fed up with those monkeys in there. What's the matter with you? You look like... Forget it. Okay. How about taking over? I'll go talk to Hal. I got no time. Get back there. Leave it to Hal. He knows what to do. No sign of Frankie yet? No. Then that settles it. He ain't coming. Let's forget about the boat, and make a run for it while we still got the chance. Stalling around won't get us nowhere. Easy. What's the matter with you guys? You're all beginning to break. We gotta get out of here. Hal's figuring out a way. Is he? Yeah. Is he? Honest? So we don't have to wait for the boat? Yeah. As a matter of fact, he wants you to go down and take a last look around, and then he has other ideas. Sure, I'll go down. You stay here, huh? Yeah. What are you bawling about? Mind your own business. Go down the back way. Hal's talking with the professor. Do you like your husband? 'Cause if you do, better make him shut his trap. He talks too much, and I don't like it. What harm is there in my husband's...? I don't like it. He's talking him deaf, dumb and blind. Make him cut it out before I do it myself. If I do, I'll shut him up for good. But why? He's making Hal act like he never did before. He ain't the same. You'll wake up my baby. What do you mean he isn't the same? He threw me out of that room like I was poison to him. He ain't done... He ain't never done that before. That's why you do like I say, see, or so help me, I'll... But I can't go down. If he threw you out of the room, what chance do I stand there? [SIGHS] You love him very much, don't you? I wish I could help you. I really do. Give it to me straight, will you? What's he trying to get out of Hal? He's not trying to drive him out of his mind, is he? It's my husband's job to save people's minds. He's done it before. But how are we gonna get out of here? Here. Get me the hammer. This catch is stuck. Get me that chair. Don't leave me here. I'm afraid. Stop bawling. I'm gonna get the cops. Give me the bucket. But if you go out there, they'll kill you. Oh, not if I see them first. How can I help you if you won't tell me what I ask? Aw, lay off. Just 'cause a guy can't remember don't mean he's going bugs. Did you ever know a man to tell a lie so often he came to believe it himself? Huh? Sure I have. You've done just the opposite. You've wiped a memory right out of your mind. You've convinced yourself it never happened. You talk and talk till a guy can't see straight. I'm going right on talking till we find out what those dream symbols stand for. There are three of them. The rain, the bars, the umbrella. What's the first thing that comes to your mind when I say the word "bars"? What do you mean? How can a guy think with you at him all the time? All right. I don't want you to think this time. Just tell me the first thing that comes into your head after I've spoken. Suppose I were to say the word "black," what's the first thing that comes to your mind? Black. Aw, white. Hot. Cold. Gun. Bullet. That's fine. Now, for your dream. Those bars. Prison. Prison? Guards. Standing all around me so that I can't get out. Then what? Nothing. Just cops standing all around me so that I can't get out. Cops? You said guards before. I can't help it. You told me to tell you the first thing that came into my head. Are the bars like policemen around you? No. Yeah, that's it. Only I can't see 'em, really. Just their legs, standing all around me. That explains one of the symbols. The bars around the umbrella are policemen's legs. What do you remember about the umbrella? What are you doing under it? Hiding. I'm trying to keep the rain off with my hand. Aren't you holding the umbrella? No. It stands up by itself. Like it had legs. I can't think. You're getting it. Where did you hide? I don't know. Somewhere on a dirty floor. There was sawdust all over it. What else do you see? I see lots of smoke, bottles. A saloon. That's it. I hid in a saloon. Where did you hide? Under the bar? You were under something. No, under the umbrella. It had legs. It was a table. This ain't right, is it? Of course it is. You can feel when it's right. You see how it works? Now we know the bars are policemen's legs, and the umbrella is a table that you're under. Now, why are you hiding? I don't know. Afraid of the cops? No, I ain't afraid of the cops. Just the rain. What does the rain mean to you? Nothing. I just hate it worse than anything. Where do you see this rain? I don't know. It makes me think of... Aw, this don't make no sense. That doesn't matter. Tell me anyway. Well, the rain makes me think of the saloon again and... ...beer being spilled on the floor. Yeah. Did you spill the beer? I was under the table, and I know I spilled it, all right. It... It dripped down on me. It was warm... and red. Blood. Itwasblood. And it came dripping through the top of the table. That's it. I remember. I hated him. I took the cops there. They promised me some dough if I'd take them to where he was hiding. I was just a kid, so I did it. [♪♪♪] We started down the street, and I turned around to see if they was following me. They was. We went into the saloon. I seen him over in the corner, sitting at a table, drinking and playing cards. His back was to me when I come in. The guys playing with him saw the cops and got up slowly and left the table. But he didn't move. He didn't move. Then, all of a sudden, he stood up and whirled around. I got scared because he got his gun and there was a wild stare in his eyes. Insane-like. So I dived under the table. He stood there shooting it out with 'em. Then, suddenly, I saw his knees buckle. He staggered. Then he fell right across the table I hid under. He dropped his gun. And I picked it up. I wanted to get out, but they was all standing around. Their legs were in the way. There must have been a crack or something in the top of the table because I... I felt something wet drop on me. Wet and warm. I looked up. It was blood. His blood, dropping on me. I put up my hand, I tried to stop it, but I couldn't. More blood come through. Right on my hand. Yeah. Yeah, that's what did it. The blood. We got it, didn't we? That's... That's what the dream meant, huh? That's right. The bars were the legs. Yeah. The umbrella was the table. The rain was the blood. And... And I won't get it no more? The nightmare, I mean? Who was that man, Wilson? I told you. He was a heel. And he lived across the street. You're lying. That man was your father. You don't know what you're talking about. Don't lie. It was your father. You know it. No, I tell you. You murdered your own father. All right, all right, it was the old man. So what? That's what you've been running away from. That's the shameful memory that caused your nightmare. I ain't ashamed of nothing, see? - Yes you are. Your sense of guilt is what's twisted your fingers. Well, he had it coming to him. After he was knocked off, things was different with me. I wasn't kicked around no more. I was head man. If the old lady needed dough, I got it for her. You've killed a lot of men since then. Sure I have. I told you I wasn't knocked around no more, see. I plugged 'em if they got in my way, cops or anyone else. I know. That gun is your symbol for power. When you stole it from your father, you took his place. And in your warped mind, anyone who opposes you becomes your father. Trying to take back his gun, trying to regain his power over you. So what? What do you mean? Simply this. Every time you kill a man, you're killing your father over again. Supposing you're right, am I gonna get that thing again? The nightmare I mean? You'll never have that dream again. Heh. You mean...? BUCK: Hal! Yeah? BUCK: Hal! [♪♪♪] What is it? Cops are outside, all around the house. Yeah? Go back to the room, pick 'em off through the windows. I'll take care of this part. You're crazy. Go do what I tell you. Curtis, we'll never get out alive. Will you stop? [WHISPERING] Will you shut up? Why take chances? The police are here now. This is a personal matter. Some unfinished business. [♪♪♪] [GLASS SHATTERS] Don't shoot unless you have to. Be careful with your fire. There are other people in the house. What are you gonna do? Blast my way to the car and make a run for it. Don't do it, Wilson. Give yourself up. Eh... It's too late. What do you mean "too late"? You're cured. You know now that every time you kill, you're murdering your father. Heh. So what? You'll never kill another man. You can't. Hal. So I can't kill no one, huh? Every guy I kill is my old man? Why, you dope. If they was all my old man, it'd be a pleasure. Hal, don't do it. Don't go out there. Watch my smoke, professor. [♪♪♪] [GUNFIRE] MARY: Hal. [MARY SOBBING] [♪♪♪] Is this all of them, professor? There's some more upstairs. GEORGE: Come on, get a move on. Is he one of them? Oh, no, he's a writer. He writes adventure stories. CRONIN: Hello. Give me the lieutenant. [SOBBING] Tony. Lieutenant, this is Cronin. Yeah. You can stop worrying. We got Wilson. Yeah. [♪♪♪]
