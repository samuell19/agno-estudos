(Keane laughing) (Keane groaning) Reminder about what? - I guess, I don't know, how- (sirens blaring) (shoes scuffling) - [Officer] Allie, stop. (Alison sighing) What's the use running, Allie? You know everybody knows everybody around here, right? - Yeah. When did you join the force? - [Officer] About a year now. It's good to see you, it's been a while. You visiting, or? - I'm not sure yet. Gonna check in with some elders. See what happens next. - Yeah. - You like it? - No, tribe's been cracking down on tagging lately. I can't turn a blind eye to this. I really don't understand it. "Playtime's over"? There ain't no playtime around here. - So what happens next? - You got your ID on you? (phone camera clicking) (phone keyboard clacking) This some kind of competition? - What do you mean? - [Officer] Says you've been in trouble twice within the last month. DUI in California and some other crazy nonsense. - Do what you gotta do. - Yeah, what I gotta do is paperwork. It's cool. We'll figure out a time you can come out, repaint the wall, make it right. The other thing I gotta do is take you home. Your brother ran off and dusted you. - Yeah, he's always been faster than me. - Yeah, come on, let's get you in the back. - So, tell me about those pickle slushies. (Officer chuckling) - [Officer] Never tried them.

You were stumbling around. - Al just got back into town. We kinda celebrated. It wasn't that late though. You were asleep. - [Melanie] I still heard you. (Keane sighing) - Sorry, Mel. I know you need your beauty sleep. (distant rooster crowing) (Keane sighing softly) (feet padding) (uplifting ambient music) (kettle whistling) - [John] You didn't forget, right? - [Keane] Well, I tried to, but it didn't work. - [John] That's not funny. I gave you the application two weeks ago. Today is the last day. They're not taking them anymore after that. - I'm just kidding. I didn't forget. - I don't know what you're waiting for, but you're going to Globe today and you're going to get that job. - [Mina] Morning. - [Keane] Good morning, Mimi, how'd you sleep? - Good, kinda woke up when you came home last night. - [Keane] Oh really? I was catching up with your Auntie Al. - Auntie Al, she's back? - Yeah, she is back. - Great, Auntie Al's back. - Mina, come get something to eat. Come get some breakfast. Mina-bina! - Morning, grandpa. - Good morning, big girl. - You know what your dad just said to me? He's gonna choke me out if I don't get that job today in Globe. Like, what the hell's wrong with him? - You know what, Key? He just wants to make sure we're all taken care of. - You want to look professional. - [Melanie] Try to eat it all, okay? - [John] I don't think he gets it. - He gets it. - Doesn't seem like it. He's dreaming. He needs to give up this artsy crap. - It's good. People like it. - Yeah, they really like it. What, he sold a piece like six months ago for 20 bucks? I don't know what was wrong with Jimmy Reed. He's got two trucks. He's got a motorcycle. He works at Forestry. Nobody cares about Native American art. This training program is a good thing. I don't think he understands that. - [Melanie] He's grateful. If that means going out and getting a job in Globe and putting on a suit and tie, then he's gonna do it because he loves us. - You should have stayed with Jimmy Reed.

What's the job? - [Keane] Um, it's at the mine. - [Alison] Dope, who are those? - [Keane] These? - [Alison] Yeah. - [Keane] John Riley's. Yeah, it must be important to him. It's not to me though, I don't really care. - It's probably the coolest thing that John Riley owns. Peridot. - Yeah, probably. - Hey, Tan's at the center. Let me stop by and say what's up to him. - Yeah, I mean, you can start walking right now. - Psh, come on. I haven't seen him in years. I heard he's not doing too hot. - All right, I guess. - [Alison] Come on, it'll only take a second. You can wait in the car. - I got a lot to do today, Al. - "I got a lot to do today, Al." Psh.

Holy ground members sing this song, all right? (Uncle Max singing in Apache) (violin strings humming) This song they sing, all of them, in church. Even the kids come to church. They can dance around if they want to 'cause they're so happy. - Hey Tan. - Fresh from California, huh? (Alison greeting in Apache language) (Tan greeting in Apache language) How have you been? - Good, and you? - [Tan] Same. Same, same. How does this place look to you with your fresh eyes? - It's different. It's like, I don't have words for it yet. - Well, you've been gone for a while. You've been coming and going. - Ha-ah. - I found that when I came back from Vegas, it wasn't where my feet were, but where my head is at. (Tan coughing) - Are you okay? - Yeah, I'm all right. I gotta tell ya, I need some help. I gotta find an assistant. Would you consider coming back? - Can't do it, Tan. Not even for you. I gotta keep following that music I hear out there. You know that. - [Tan] As you should. I was just asking. - What about Keane? - [Tan] He'd be perfect too. Do you think he'd be interested? - He would. - Hmm. - It's really good to see you, Tan. - Wait, I've got something for you. - Are you ready? - Just wait, hold up a second. (Keane sighing) What's wrong, little bro? - I gotta get some stuff copied before that interview. - Today? - Today, yes, right now. I gotta go. - [Alison] Hold on, hold on. We got some time. I'm riding with you, bro. How about that Simon last night? I can't believe that crazy dude became an officer. - Shit, yeah, it's funny, right? Simon, the craziest one out of the whole crew I used to run with. Hell, not even that long ago. - Lucky thing it was him. I got some recent priors and definitely don't need some more headaches. - [Keane] Are you serious? And you tagged up that whole wall downtown? You crazy? - Simon thought so. - What were you thinking? - [Alison] That's kind of why I'm here, so I can clear my head a bit, figure out what's next. (traditional Apache string music) (Uncle Max singing in Apache) So it means just like every prayer, safe, where you can be home, everywhere you go, you can be safe. My father used to be a medicine man. He was lead player and a singer. So that's how I learned. (Uncle Max singing in Apache) - [Tan] For you. - What? For me? (Alison thanking in Apache) - You're welcome. - Well, we better get going, but I'll come and visit soon. - Okay. (Alison speaking Apache) - See you later, Tan. - All right.

It's been a long time. - Hey Kash, what's up? - Hey, what's going on? - [Keane] Hey, I need a quick favor. I need to print out a job application if that's okay with you. - You guys know this is a gas station, right? (bell chiming) - It's gonna be real, real quick. - How much are you gonna donate? - I mean, I got this dollar. (bell chiming) - All right, this one time. - Thank you.

Long time. - [Alison] Hey guys, what's going on? (students chattering) How's school? - Eh, I just want to go home and party. - Yeah? - Yeah. - When did they put that here?

Al! - Hey Miss Yancey. - [Miss Yancey] Hey! - How you doing? - How you been? - Good. - Good, good to see you. - You too. - So, how long are you here for? - I'm not sure yet. - And you're still in school, right? - You know it. - [Miss Yancey] Getting those grades? - Yes ma'am. - That's my girl. - Hey, so we stopped at the Cultural Center and we ran into Tan. How's he doing? - [Miss Yancey] Not good. Not good. He does so much for the community. It's so hard to see him that way. Keep him in your prayers, okay? - We will. - Hey Miss Yancey, I came here to get a transcript. You think you could? - [Miss Yancey] Yes. - Because I really need to get that job today. - Okay, I'll be back. (heels clacking) (intercom beeping) - Hey, check out the new logo. - It changed. - Yeah. - Hmm. - [Miss Yancey] Okay, here they are. - Thanks. - You got this.

(oil sizzling) (tortilla slapping) (car creaking) (Keane sighing) - [Keane] Hey, where the hell did I work before the sanitation? Do you remember? - [Alison] Wasn't it the clinic? - Oh yeah, that's right. God, that sucked. I could never figure out the phone system. - [Taco Vendor] Indian taco! - Mmm. - I feel like she wants to leave me. - Hmm? What makes you say that? - She said she wants to take classes on the main campus. That's like six hours away. I don't know. I feel like something's changing. - She loves you. She wouldn't do that. You and Mimi are so close. - I don't know, I mean, I know she loves me, but that doesn't mean she wouldn't take that step. She's kinda like you in a way. The outside is calling her. - Now, is that why you have that fancy shirt on today? - Yeah, I guess you could say that. (Keane muttering in frustration) - [Alison] Can I get aluminum foil? - You ready? - Yeah. - I think I missed these more than I missed you. - Ha ha ha ha. - Uncle, look. She's looking at me. Her eyes are talking. They say, "I don't want this." I am? (engine whirring) - Why you gotta leave the res? - Already done every job here, remember? I gotta do this. - Okay, it's your life. Hey, maybe don't say anything about your job interview today. - Why? You ashamed of that? - It's just, I love you. - [Tan] So, what are you two up to today? - [Tan] How's your knee? (Tan coughing) I'm okay for the moment. Hey, if you guys find some peridot up there, bring it back. I can help you make some jewelry. - Okay, well, you guys be careful up there. - We'll be fine. - Okay, you guys. (Tan coughing) Watch your knee. - [Mina] Uncle, that was so cool. - Yeah.

It looks pretty bad, I'm taking her to the ER. She's gonna be all right. - Hi, can I help you? - Yeah, I'm Keane, here about that training program. - Well, we do the training and the staffing of 22 different institutes and training programs across Gila County. So you can see on our poster, those are the companies that we work with. - Um, I don't know the name of it exactly. - Well, which category of training was it for? We have light industrial, electrical, HVAC, logistics. - John Riley. He made a call for me. He talked to the head man. They said I'm supposed to have a slot reserved for the program. - I'm sorry, honey, but I don't know who John Riley is and I don't know who he would've talked to. All our programs involve the same application process. I wanna help you, I do, but I can't unless you can tell me which program you want. You know, maybe if I could see the forms you brought in, maybe that might help. - [John] I made a lot of phone calls. I made a lot of appointments. I set this all up for you. I put my name out there for you. (tense, dissonant music) - Fuckin' bullshit! (door slamming) (dissonant music intensifying) (horse whinnying) (fire crackling) (distant screaming) (Keane panting) (door clanking) (fist knocking) - I'm looking for my brother. - [Woman] Keane? - Yes. - He's come and gone.

(rocks crunching) (Keane sniffling) (Keane panting) (gravel crunching) Hey Simon, I owe you one. Or two. - [Simon] No, we're good. (Keane weeping) - [Alison] I knew you'd be here. Takes an Apache to catch an Apache. - Leave me the fuck alone. - Never. - No, not never. You always leave me. Next you'll be a hairstylist in Sacramento... Whatever! You bounced for like a year, then you show up outta the blue. How many times was that? - Five. Five times. - Yeah, five. You always say stupid stuff like that, like you're never gonna leave me. I needed you. (Keane sobbing) - [Alison] Remember when Dad used to take us camping? And he'd tell us the story of our ancestors? Of how sacred this place was? I knew you'd be here. When Uncle got in that car accident, you were here. When they told us Dad was gone, you were here. - Mm. - Remember when we used to go camping, you used to try to sneak those pudding cups? He would catch you. - Mm-hmm. - Snatch it right outta your hand. "Our ancestors didn't have no pudding cups. So we don't need no pudding cups here either." (Keane chuckling) What do you think ever happened to those pudding cups? - He ate all of them. - Hell yeah, he did. (both chuckling) - Yeah. Good memories. - I miss him. - I do too. - But he's here. He's here with us. Oh, hey, I got something for you. You dropped that. The lady was kind enough at the office to give that back to me after you tore that place up. (Keane chuckling) You know what? I don't think they're gonna give you that job. - No shit. (both chuckling) - Hey, um, Mimi got bit by a scorpion. - What? What the hell!? - It's okay! It was a tiny one. You dropped your phone when you got in that fight with Jason. You were gone already! I charged up your phone, Melanie called. Uncle Max took her up to the peridot mines. It's okay, John Riley took her to the hospital. (Keane sighing) - John Riley. - [Alison] Here. - Let's go to the hospital, then. - All right, let's go. (wistful piano music) (crickets chirping) (phone vibrating) (Keane sighing) - Yeah, Mel. Yeah, Al just told me, I'm heading back right now. - Where are you? - I'm at Oak Flat. - What the hell are you doing up there? - How's Mimi? Is she okay? - [Melanie] Yeah, she's fine now. Dad's got her. We're making supper now. - Good. Jesus. She must have been so scared. - [Melanie] She was. Everyone was. No one could get ahold of you. - I know. I'm sorry. I dropped my phone. - Keane, please. Please tell me you got the job. At least tell me that. - I didn't. - [Melanie] Did or didn't? - He did not get the job. - Shut up, Alison. - I know, I'm sorry, Mel. When I get back home, we can talk about all of this then. I can feel something different. - Yeah, me too. (water boiling on stove) - [Alison] I'll drive. Something better. - Let me guess. - You don't have to. You already know. - What are you gonna do? - I don't know. - [Mina] Mommy, where's the good pens? - Uh, third shelf, baby, in the cup. - [Mina] Thanks, Mom. (Mina's footsteps receding) (water continues boiling) (calming music begins) - [Keane] So what happened with school and everything? Aren't you supposed to go back? - I don't know. - You're like the Queen of I-don't-know Land. - [Alison] Psh, and you're the prince. - True. But you got a big scholarship and everything. That's a lot to walk away from. - I get to a big city, right? All these lights. I know no one. Don't have a job, no money. Nada. I like that feeling. Freedom. I really, I mean, I really, really like that. - [Keane] Yeah? - [Alison] Yeah. I mean, I hit up some parties, get to know a few people, but then, I don't know. Things start... I don't know, like... I'm in a box. Just... Everyone thinks they know me. So what do I do? I run. I run. - [Keane] Damn. Every time? - I'm not sure if they're gonna let me back this semester to tell you the truth. Yeah. I guess we're both fucked. (Alison chuckling) (Keane chuckling) - Yo, you hear Mel's voice? She sounds so mad. - You both love each other. No matter what. You're so hard on yourself. You've always been. I think the reason why, I think you can't even see how great you are. Everybody sees it but you. It's like a dude walking down a street full of emeralds. It's like, "Look down, dummy. Just pick it up." It's right there. - Yeah. - I got a job for you, by the way. - Don't mess with me. - I'm not kidding. Tan said they need help at the Cultural Center. Somebody with artistic skills to help out with the exhibits and murals. - Like a part-time job? - No, full-time job. - That would've been real helpful before I talked to my wife! - What can I say? I'm a piece of work. - Piece of something. That's, that's amazing. - [John] Hey, Uncle Max. That's a really nice peridot rock you got there. It is. I'm gonna make a lot of jewelry out of this and I'll be rich. (John chuckling) - Rich is good. - [Uncle Max] It is. (mellow hip-hop music) - [Alison] You ready for this? - [Keane] I think so. - [Mina] Daddy! And Auntie Al! - [Keane] Hey, baby. I'm so sorry I wasn't there when you got hurt. How's your leg? You okay? - It feels fine now. They just gave me some medicine and put some cream on it. - What happened in Globe? - I didn't get it. - That's right you didn't get it, you trashed the place. I called. - You called!? Right. You basically set me up for failure. They didn't know who I was. - Are you kidding? - [John] Well, I guess that's the end of that. You know what? You can't stay here anymore. - My daughter lives here. What are you talking about? - Come on, Mimi. - I can't stay here with my wife and my child? - That's not your wife. You're not even legally married. You're just shacking up. And that's not your real daughter. And my granddaughter and my daughter need a real man to really take care of them. - Come stay with me and Uncle Max. - Dammit! (fist thudding) I'm not leaving without those two. What the hell were you thinking, Max? Bringing Mina all the way up to peridot mine? I told you it was dangerous, you just did it anyway. - [Alison] Keane, stop. (backpack thudding) What the hell, man? - Pack your stuff. You're done here. - [Melanie] I'm done too. Me and Mina are gonna go live with Mom. (poignant piano music) She takes care of us. She sends Mina money. You two need to get it together. I have one child, not three. - Please don't take her away from me. - Key, you need to grow up. I love you, but I don't understand why you act the way you do. I'm tired of waiting. - I thought her Mom was dead. - That is what you tell people that don't come around much, isn't it? That she's dead. That's disgusting. - Please don't run away. - [John] You're right. She walked out. She just left. I wasn't a good husband. - You weren't always unhappy. - Just put the bag down. It's late. It's a long drive. The baby's tired. We can talk about it in the morning, later. Whatever you want. Keane. We need to go for a ride. - Where? - [John] Don't worry about it. I have some things I need to tell you. Just down by the tracks. You can come too, Al. You probably need to. - [Keane] I need to be with Mina and Mel. What are we doing here? - I know, I know. - This place looks familiar. - [John] Fortuna. This is an old mine. It's a little bit overgrown, but this is the place. - [Alison] I think Dad used to work here. Why'd you bring us here? - [John] Your Dad and I... Man, we were so close. We were like brothers. He had my back, I had his. (John chuckling) We even snuck off to Mexico one time. We were scared the whole time. But it was fun, it was crazy. I was a knucklehead. But we both got jobs right outta high school. Well, actually, that's not true. He got a job right outta high school. I was always in trouble. Jail, arrested, fights, and he pulled me out of it. He got me a job. - That's how he was. - [John] Oh man. That's how he was, though. Everybody respected him. And I watched him. I wanted to be like him. But I was good at math too, and I wanted to be in management. But your dad, all he cared about was you and your sister and your mom. And I told him, "We need to get this job done right on schedule." And I pushed him and I pushed him and he said, "John, it's too dangerous, man. We need more people, man. We don't even have the right equipment." But no, I wanted to be a bigshot. I wanted to be a company guy. - What? What are you talking about? - [John] They called me in and they told me to tell everyone it was an 'Act of God'. The newspaper said it was because of the effects of a lightning strike. It wasn't no Act of God. It was criminal negligence. The air was poisoned. He suffocated. I let him down and I left him in that hole. So I quit. I got a job in the stinking prison in Florence, and I felt like that's where I belonged. - You're damn right. - [Keane] You forced me to go to Globe? Take my family away from me? You tell me you fuckin' killed my Pops? So what the fuck happens to me now? (eerie whirring intensifies) (twinkling ambient music) (whirring continues) (moccasins running on gravel) (wind gusting) (distant Apache violin playing) (twinkling ambient music continues) (wind blows intensely) ('Apache Tear' stones falling to ground) (door creaks open) - What are you drawing, Mimi? - It's a picture of somebody. Uncle Max told me all about her at the mesa. - What was her name? - [Mina] Loosen? - Oh, Lozen? What did he tell you about her? - That she was super brave and she had powers in her spirit and how she could see things far away. - She's very special, just like you. Oh, you're getting really good at your drawing, no joke. - I wanna make things like Dad does. Everything he does is beautiful. - [John] I wasn't hard on you because I didn't care. I was hard on you because I messed up too. I never hated you. I just wanted you to be the man that he wanted you to be. I could see him in you, and it was just too much. But I never hated you. Sometimes I can hear him, I can hear his laugh, and sometimes I can see him, and I can see his smile, and I see it in you. - [Keane] Do you think you can get over that? Seeing my face? - I got no choice. You're a part of the family now. You ready to go? - [Alison] Let's go. - [John] All right. (stones clinking) (door opening) (Uncle Max snoring faintly) (John sighs) - Al, you can stay here. I'll get you some blankets. - You all right? - Weirdly, yeah. You? - Better. - Goodnight, sis. I love you. - Love you too. Hey, good luck in there. (door creaks open) - Hey. - Hey Mel. I didn't mean to wake you up. - What happened? (door closes) - Playtime is over. - Playtime? (Keane sighs) - Got a job today at the Cultural Center. - Really? - Yeah. - Sounds like a good fit. It's getting late. (shoes falling on floor) (mattress springs creaking) (lamp switch clicks off) (gentle synth music) (radio tuner crackling) (poignant ambient music) (gravel crunching) (engine whirring) - Hey Mimi, don't forget your sketch. - Oh wait. Can I hold that one? - [Alison] Here you go, Mimi, thank you. (cans rattling) Okay, let's go. - [Keane] Whoo, this could take awhile. (Alison chuckling) Let's get it, let's get it. Hand me the caps in there. (spraypaint can rattling) Yeah, thank you. [Alison] Come on, Keane! Open up that can. (Alison laughing) (cans rattling) [Alison] Okay, Mimi, let's look at your sketch. [Mina] So, the base will maybe be right here. [Alison] Mm hmm. [Mina] Right there on the top it passes on the line or something like that. [Alison] Mm hmm. (cans rattling) [Mina] So it'll be like right there. [Mina] Like in the middle, and a little bit up top. (orchestral music swells) (group laughing) (cans rattling) (radio tuner crackling) (uplifting, ambient hip-hop music) (Anthony Logan singing traditional Apache song) [Native Arts Film Academy Students] We're speeding! [Students] Speeding. Action! [Chris McIntosh] Academy Interview, take four. (laughter and clapping) [Christian Rozier] Okay, cut! Thank you so much. (traditional Apache singing continues) (gentle ambient music) (windchime tinkling) (sonic crescendo)
