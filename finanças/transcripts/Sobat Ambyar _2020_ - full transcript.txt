Sobat Ambyar! There's no discrimination in songs. All songs from any genre depend on how we present them, and now those songs are being visualized through a movie. For me, that is an achievement. Everybody came. The director and the whole team came. It's amazing. We're a package deal, and I really love that. I will try to adapt and keep learning. -Your heart feels it. -Yes. Amen. -Thank you! Sobat Ambyar! -Sobat Ambyar! I hope this movie will be widely accepted. To traditional artists out there, never get discouraged! Keep creating masterpieces. Traditional songs can make it to the big screen and can be presented not just to local but also to international audiences. Thank you, and a Sobat Ambyar salute to you! NETFLIX PRESENTS A gold necklace Dangling on your neck Now has turned blue Faded away like your love Faded away like your heart Now that you have forgotten me Together. My heart aches The pain runs deep The pain Creeps deep into my chest I cried It's all because of you It's unbearable What did I do? What have I done? Son of a bitch! What just happened? What's wrong with that kid? Jat? Jat? Excuse me… Kid, just stay here. Can you tell me what's going on? This is what happened, sir. 1 MONTH AGO My cafe is as quiet as a graveyard. No, it's not. It's just delayed rush hour. Jat, money is like a magnet. It's attracted to positive thoughts. I'll prove it. This cafe will be full. Customers will come. Kopet is a good boy. Kopet will be successful. See? What did I tell you? Let me. -Good evening, sir. -What do you sell here? We sell coffee, sir. What kind? We have cappuccino, mochaccino, and latte. Arabica or Robusta? Arabica and Robusta. We have everything. What are the sizes? Regular, grande, venti. Is there a restroom here? Go straight, turn left, it's on your right. Thank you. Sir? Your coffee? I'm not buying any. He just needs to use the restroom. I'll call La Vittoria tomorrow. I'll tell them we don't need to restock. You mean we're closing up shop, Jat? What else can we do? We don't have customers. Are you giving up? This is so not like you, Jat. This is me, Pet. This is my reality. No way. I'm your life's witness, Jat. We've been friends since elementary. Remember selling kebabs on the streets? Now you have this great franchise. I've always been there for you. Then you should've witnessed that I've been losing money too. I'm paying your salary bit by bit. I feel like paying in installments. -Forget that, what's important-- -Anjani will be in college next year! That's enough. Buying this franchise was a bad decision. That's not true, Jat. Pet, we're open from 8:00 a.m. to 10:00 p.m. Who came this morning? Three kids who even asked for discounts. Tonight? A guy who just wanted to use the toilet. All right. Whatever. Turn it off, Pet. Pet! Turn it off! What? I said turn it off. You said we're closing. It's only 8:00 p.m. We close at 10:00 p.m. What's wrong with you, Jat? Why are you playing campursari in an Italian cafe? Just leave it! Why did you turn the music off? Can't you play it some more? Our franchise policy states that playing music isn't allowed so customers can peacefully talk to each other. I see. Those are usual drinks. What's your house specialty? Our house specialty is one of a kind in Indonesia. -It's our ancestor's original recipe. -Could you excuse us for a minute? -Ouch! -What are you doing? You know what I'm doing, Jat. What if she doesn't like it? You won't get a girl if you're pessimistic. -Shit, don't say that. -Just look at her. Look! That girl looks healthy. She's gorgeous too. You're not healthy if you're not attracted to her. Got it? Go to the storage room and make that coffee. Ask for her name, her number, and strike up a conversation. Got that? This coffee should be served hot and should only be served in medium size so your taste buds won't get bored. What name should I write? The People of Indonesia. I'll be waiting. Thank you. Order for the People of Indonesia. Okay. Here's your coffee. Thank you. What's this coffee's name? Tembang Manis. So cute. I meant the coffee's name. It's time. Just ask, Jat. This isn't life or death. You're so full of crap! Do it right. This is heavy. Get going, sir. That's just a flower pot. Be careful. Excuse me, sir. -Watch it. Careful. -Jat. -Right here, sir. -Miko. Who is she? She's just like my wife, so mean and such a pain in the ass. That's my sister, Anjani. Don't mind her. She's just upset. Why? She's against me closing the shop. She's pissed at you. -Me? -Because I can't get any leniency. -Are you talking about me? -No, you heard it wrong. -Do you want to know what I'm feeling? -Enough! Stop it! Honey! Stay out of it! I'm not! I'm not interfering! Excuse me! Is the cafe closing down? It's open. We just finished renovating. All the furniture will be placed inside in 15 minutes, right? Yes, close your mouth. Come on. Let's go inside. -Come on! Get the stuff back inside! -Okay. -You can't even pay. Why be fierce? -Sir… -No way! -Hey! You're a big guy! Why are you so useless? So that's it? Do I have to carry everything myself? Order for Congo and its neighborhood. Yes. It's still sweet like before, right? Yes. Thank you. You're welcome. -Can I start teasing you now? -What are you talking about? What about Mr. Faris? Relax, Jat. We still have a month. How's that possible? I pawned our car registration to Mr. Faris. Why did you do that? What if we can't pay him back? -That is dad's favorite car, Anjani. -Come on, Jat. That's more important. Get to know her. Go on. Just go to your practice! I'll go after I see you get her number. It's no use. Your brother is too shy. -Move it. -What are you doing? -Come on. -No! -One, two-- -I won't do it. -Jat! -Why… The first love Is never easy to forget Till this moment… For Love. The heart will always remember Only you Only you Nobody else Nobody ever will Till this moment Till death comes This love is irreplaceable… Your girl left! You're taking forever, Jat. Only you Nobody else Nobody ever will "You're in France, I'm in Lawang Sewu." "Pretty girl, what's your name?" That's the pick-up line I used when I met your sister. That's what made her attracted to me. -What am I supposed to do with this? -Give it to her. No way. This is so tacky. All right. I'll give it to her then. No, don't. Either you talk to her or I will. Go. Now! Those who understand and feel it Together in laughter and tears Only me… Never mind. Jat. What's that? Isn't that for me? Yes. Well, no. It's your receipt, but I got the wrong item. This is not your order. I was going to get the correct one. -Is there a side door here? -Yes, over there. Come on. Let's go. ALL-WOMEN BOARDING HOUSE Fried rice! Fried rice! -I'm selling fried rice here! -You're too loud! -What are you doing? -This is weird! Satay vendors yell, not fried rice vendors! -Are you protesting or buying? -Can you stop yelling? Someone is sleeping. That girl lives here, but why is she sleeping in the car? -Don't tell her what to do. -You're telling me what to do! I'm not. I'm just asking. -You are! -I'm not! -Let's just fight this off! -Okay. As long as I win. -We all want to win! -What do you want? -Pay for my fried rice. -How much is it? -Ten thousand rupiah. -Here's 20,000 rupiah. Keep the change, and eat that fried rice. Stop yelling here and get going. Go away. You're so arrogant. I can give you 50,000 rupiah. No, I don't want it. -Take this! -No! -Are you sure? -Yes. -I'm leaving. -Yes, just go. Are you sure you won't regret this? This is taking too long. Give me back my money. I was just kidding. Excuse me, I'll be going now. Just go, you noisy jerk. I'll go now. -Fried rice! -Hey! What an asshole. It's already dark? Yes. You were fast asleep. Wait! That door is a bit tricky. Oh, I'm sorry about what happened earlier. You've said "I'm sorry" a thousand times. I think you won't stop unless I give you a door prize. But I think I owe you a thousand times too. A thousand thank yous. See you soon. Will you come to the cafe tomorrow? Well… you said see you soon. Actually, it's like this. I can't work on my paper at my apartment. Just go to the cafe and work on your paper there. Wait, just hear me out. I came to your cafe because I thought they wouldn't… They? -They or he? -They. That's what happened. Once they see me, they will become so dramatic. Sooner or later, you'll see. What if whoever they are or he is won't come to the cafe again? How would you know that? I promise, they won't. Promise? Okay, I'll be going now. You think too much. Saras. Jatmiko. That's how it goes, Jat. If you focus on positive things, the universe will side with you. You still have a long way to go, Jat. That's why I have a task for you both. That duck shit guy that came here yesterday-- Duck shit? I have prospected him. What does he mean? He befriended him so he would be a regular here. You invited him here? What are you doing? Do you want your car registration back? He is rich. Welcome. Saras, I know you're sick of my IG stories for the last three months. They have been all about you, even when I'm just nothing to you. For Pete's sake. We have a queer bawling his eyes out. What a drama queen. -Who is that? -No idea. Why is a construction worker like you stalking me? Explain! Do you think your overblown, poetic IG stories will make Saras fall for you? You're disgusting. -They're going to fight. -Will exposing your six packs in IG make Saras love you? You're full of shit! -Bastard! -Asshole! Jat! -Here, Pet. -Why me? Please calm down, guys! -I'll gouge your eyes out! -You're just talking shit! Would you like Americano, mochaccino, cappuccino? -What is Saras' usual? -Usually… -Get it straight! -Americano! -I'll have two Americanos! -Two Americanos. I'll take four! Scratch my two orders. I'll take ten! Hold on! If you take too much, you'll have acid reflux! This is coffee, not a coconut drink! I don't care. I have lots of friends. I'll bring them all here. You jerk! -What? -Go breastfeed on your mom! How old are you anyway? You're not suitable for Saras! -Hold on! Chill out, guys! Istikharah! -It's istighfar! That's what I meant. Ras! It's you. I was about to go to your cafe. At the cafe, there's… -What? -That guy yesterday. -Tommy? -Yes, and another guy. Who else? A muscled man, like a construction worker. -Does he have tattoos? -Yes. -He does? -Yes. Oh, my god. Anton? You told them to get lost, right? You promised me. That's why I'm here. I came here to apologize. My paper's deadline is so close. I lost all the data of the interview I conducted. I only have three weeks to find another subject. I can't change my title. I need to find a local product that is decades old. I have to find the contacts, licenses, and permits. Can you use coffee as your local product? The coffee you drank yesterday, Tembang Manis, was my parent's legacy. That's a 15-year-old recipe. Will you just stand there until my defense? Defense? Are you in some kind of trouble? My thesis defense. Right. -May I come in? -Yes, of course. Please. Sorry, this door is stuck. I can only open one side. Please. This is kopi beras. It's better known as green bean. We use three types of coffee. This one is Robusta from Banaran. This one is Arabica. This is from Temanggung. And the last one is Excelsa. -Excelsa? -Yes. This is from Wonosobo. Now coffee beans are processed by machines, but this is how we do it. This process is called digongseng. It means roasting. Can I try it? So this is how you roast them? Am I doing it right? I'm not? Oh, dear. You're sweating. It's very hot in here. -I'm sorry. -Do you have to roast it on the ground? -No, they just fell. -Okay, I'll pick them up. Don't. They are hot. -It's okay. -No, don't. I'll do it. -You delivered coffee using a motorbike? -Yes. When I was a kid, my dad would let me ride on the back of his motorbike after school. We went to the bus stations and villages and traveled all over Solo to sell coffee. Whenever my dad roasted coffee beans, my sister, Anjani, would wait here for the coffee to cool down. Once they cool down, we put them in here. We usually store them for up to two weeks, depending on the type of coffee, then we process them. What's your role then? I… My role is to grind them, and my parents pack them up. My mom would sit here, and my dad would be over there. Your mom… sat over here? So your mom and dad… when did they die? Five years ago. After my soccer game, my uncle said they died in a car crash. I envy you, Jat. Ever since I was a kid… it's always been my mom and me, just the two of us. What about your dad? My dad… He left us. He came by once when I was in junior high. Then he left again. Here's some tissue, Ras. No, thanks. They'll eventually dry up. I'll make some coffee for you. This is mixed with ginger, lemongrass, cardamom, and cinnamon. Is this Tinari coffee? No. This is Sari Sore. Tinari is a coffee brand, not a recipe. What does Tinari mean in Indonesian? Blessed compatibility. This coffee is named Tinari because my parents' birth cycles were compatible. Dad processed the coffee, and mom made the recipes. The spices made my heart… all warm inside. Why didn't you sell your family's coffee? My dad has one made in the same year. Really? Please, ma'am and sir. That is a perfect honeymoon souvenir. -No, sir. We're just… -Engaged? -No, sir. -In a relationship? -Do we look great together, sir? -It depends. If you buy my stuff, I'll say you do. Isn't it gorgeous? It's vintage. It's like a necklace from an ancient kingdom. Look. That lamp is beautiful, right? Hey. Why are you so quiet? Don't you feel comfortable going out with me? I like going out with you. Jat… do you like me? The Somalian president is on TV. If you like me… what are you going to do? Do you… want me to be your girlfriend? No. I mean, I do! No, Ras. Just a second. Ras? Ras! Hey. -Come on. Laugh. -I did. -All done? -Yes. Your name is written here. Thank you. No. Thank you. Here's some Tembang Manis to keep you company tonight. I can taste your mom and dad's love in this cup. I hope everything goes smoothly during your thesis defense tomorrow. -Amen. -Amen. Thank you, Jat. TINARI COFFEE Saras? How was it? Ras? I passed, Jat! -Take good care of her! -Will do! Finally. The four years of torture I went through has finally ended. Here's something to keep you smiling all day. Jat, thank you! What's wrong? It's nothing. -Can you put it on me? -Sure, I'll put it on you. How sweet! -We're getting caught! -Are you guys on a honeymoon? If a couple is in love Erupting volcanoes wouldn't bother them If a couple likes each other A nuclear war wouldn't bother them Even with no money They would try to give everything They said when it's meant to be They will own the world Who owns that pointy nose? It belongs to you Who owns those thin lips? It belongs to you Who owns that strong chin? It belongs to you Who owns that waist? It belongs to you What about these? Who do they belong to? They must belong to someone What about these? Who do they belong to? They must belong to someone What about these? I'm going very slow here. You want to get better, don't you? You shouldn't have played in the rain yesterday. You're right. I didn't know I would get sick easily. That hurts. I don't want to be your nurse. Who's going to make my coffee if you're sick? Ras? Why do you want to be my girlfriend? Because you're always there for me and because you always make time for me when I need you. When I come back from Surabaya, I don't want to see you like this again. When will you leave? What will you do there? I'm leaving tomorrow. I've never returned to Surabaya ever since I studied here. When will you be back? Hey. My birthday is coming up in two weeks. I promise I'll be back a day before my birthday so we can celebrate together. Okay? Why the long face? Don't give me that look. I want to see your smile, Jat. Okay? DON'T GET SICK WHERE ARE YOU NOW? Ton, hold on. What are you doing? That's the guy! -Pet. -Jat? Enough. -Pet. -Jat? Pet! Jat! -What is your name? -Jat! What is your name? -Jatmiko! -Keep it together. Listen! I need your help. I'm leaving Saras in your hands. Please take care of her. Will you, please? Please help me! Come on, Ton. You're a Muay Thai instructor. What if your students see you like this? Come on. Ton, you're the one crying, but I'm the one who's embarrassed. It's a done deal. I promise. I will take care of Saras with all my heart. With my life. Thank you. Ton, that's enough. Let's just go home. You survived, Jat. -Come on. Let's go. -Come on, Ton. Let's go home. -Come on. -Let's go home. That's enough, Ton. Stop embarrassing yourself. Let me go, Pet. WHERE ARE YOU? A WEEK FEELS LIKE A CENTURY. Jat? -Jat? -That's rude! What is it? Mr. Faris called and asked for his money. Pet, just listen to me first. You're not just lying to me. You're lying to Anjani too. Are you going mad, Jat? Is Ras' gold necklace more important than the cafe? More important than Anjani's daily needs? -I'll talk to Mr. Faris. -It's no use. Tomorrow, you have to give up your car. Pet, just calm down. We can talk everything out. Mr. Faris doesn't want to talk to you. He wants your money. Just trust me. Mr. Faris just needs a heart-to-heart talk. That won't do! Pet, a man like Mr. Faris would understand if we just reached out to his heart. No way, Jat! I sincerely ask for your understanding, sir. Please don't, sir. I don't care! My wife is vicious, Jat. She even yelled at a goat yesterday. It turned into a tengkleng. Give me your SMNRK. It's STNK, sir. Yes, that. Give it to me! Good afternoon. Sorry to interrupt. Jat, this is important. We need you to name your price. Anton and I want to hold a major event here. It's called Munas Loro Ati. -You mean a national conference… -For the brokenhearted? Jat, you have such good luck. Here are your vehicle ownership documents. Thank you, sir. All right. I don't know what would've happened to me if it weren't for them. Why would they want to talk about heartaches? That's weird. Why? My heart aches The pain runs deep The pain creeps Deep into my chest These tears He has formally proposed to me in front of my family. Invitations were already sent. Is it because I'm so pretty? Is it because I'm famous? Why did my friends backstab me? This caused me so much pain! But our marriage got canceled just because our birth cycle doesn't match! Ambyar! This is my story. Back then, many girls came to me. But they only used me! I drove and picked them up. I paid for their breakfast, lunch, and even their dinner! I carried their shopping bags! Both my hands were full of bags, but they still asked me to hold their mobile phones. Where could I put those? They said I could put it in my tummy. So they would take their mobile phones, touch my tummy, and put their mobile phones here. My tummy swallowed it. I was humiliated! Ambyar! I want to be like this chunky dude! I want to graduate! I have to graduate! Jat. I wish you all the happiness, Jat. I have to graduate this Munas Loro Ati. -Right? -Right! For those with broken hearts! For those with tortured souls! It was meant to be… Ambyar! This heart Was meant to suffer WHAT ARE YOU DOING? WHY HAVEN'T YOU SENT ME NEWS? Jat, just ask the shop to send the item to Surabaya. You don't have to take it to her yourself. At least she will see my effort, Pet. I'll get the item at the store and go straight to Surabaya. I'll ask you one more time, Jat. Are you sure you want to go to her? I have to find out what's going on. I can't stop thinking about her. My head is about to explode. Okay? All right. I'll leave you in charge of the cafe. -Be careful. -You should be careful! Sir? This is not the road on the map! You're such a nag! This is a shortcut! Dear god. -Can you be patient? -This is not just a doll. This is my hope, my love. Don't act like you've never been in love. I get what love is, but I don't bother other people with it. You're an asshole! I'm really sorry, sir! Hold the cake. Make a wish. -I'll just put this here. -Not there. Set it down here. You can sit over there. What would you like to drink? Scoot over a bit. Tell me, why haven't you replied to my texts? I was busy applying for jobs here. So how were your interviews? What did they ask you? -When will the result-- -I got the job. Why didn't you tell me, Ras? I could've helped you with your application and prepped you for the interview. Abdul! That hurts. Happy birthday, sweetheart. Thank you. May you always be happy. -Who is he? -I should be asking that. Who is he, Ras? This is Abdul. He's my boss. I'm Abdul. And me? I'm the CEO of an almost bankrupt cafe. What am I to you? -Why ask that? -Answer me! Who am I? Hey. -You don't need to yell. -I want an answer! Does Saras still want to be with me or not? Why don't you settle your business here? I'll wait inside. Can't I be happy, Jat? So… So were you just pretending to be happy with me? Come on, Jat. I do care a lot for you. You're kind, and you care a lot about me. But Abdul understands what I really want. This is about feelings, Jat. You can't force feelings. Am I wrong to follow my heart? You asked me to take care of myself, but you're the one hurting me, Ras. You have to choose. Will you choose me… or him? Ras? Jat! Jat! I can forgive you, Ras. -But please promise-- -Can you take the bear? It's so huge. Where would I put it? As it should be This heart suffers The person that I love Broke her promise Don't you remember All those moments When love blooms in our hearts What did I do wrong? To make you break your promise Is it because of my life? I have no money My life is so different from your life I'm suffering Because I'm deeply in love with you I never thought I'd be hurt I'm suffering Because I'm deeply in love with you I never thought I'd be hurt -Babe! -Hey, babe. Is Jat not here yet? -Jat? -Jatmiko? -Come here. -Jat… What is it, Jat? Please help me. Look for information on this Abdul guy, Pet. What's his favorite food and hobbies? What does he do all day? Whatever you need, I'll cover the cost. Sounds good, right? Have you lost your mind, Jat? I just need a confirmation. What you need is common sense, Jat. Come on, you'll go crazy if you keep thinking about her. You going crazy is contagious. We'll all go mad because of you. Everyone in Solo will go crazy because of you. You don't know what it's like to have a broken heart, Pet. Everyone knows that you're hurting, Jat. The problem is, do you want to get better? I have been trying to forget her. Jat. Do you think Mom and Dad would be happy… to see you like this? That's enough, Jat. Anjani and I have a plan for you so you can forget Saras. The problem is, do you want that? I do. Actually, I don't really like being set up on a date like this especially by a student who is a regular at my canteen. But since Anjani always pays for her meals and said you're a decent guy, I agreed to meet you. It's been ages since I went on a date with a cute guy like you. By the way, it's okay if you're not comfortable with me. I understand. No, Ras. I'm okay. Ras? Who is Ras? I'm sorry, ma'am. Why are you speaking so formally? Pardon my expression, ma'am. I deeply apologize. Am I your grandma? Why are you using formal Javanese to me? It's only been five minutes since we've known each other. How could you forget my name already? Just so you know, I've been trying for more than a year now, but I still can't forget him. Sorry, I didn't mean to vent to you. Okay, let me just be frank with you. I can't accept you. My heart is shattered, torn, and pulled like a kite by my ex! Do you understand that? I understand. I know. I gave him money when he was poor. I paid for his meals. I bought him a camera for his YouTube channel. Meanwhile, I almost had no money left for my canteen business. Have I not given him enough? What a goat! Do you sell alcohol? This is just a small stall. Please don't get drunk here. You suck. He now has one million subscribers. I was betrayed and replaced with a prettier YouTuber. I'm okay though. I'm strong. I will not cry. That bastard doesn't deserve my tears. -Am I right? -Yes. But… But my heart hurts so bad! Hey, do you have some tissue? I only have this. That's a rag, not a tissue! A rag is fine! All men are just like rags anyway! What is this? MR. CHAE'S FOOD STALL It's okay, Jat. It's a start. I'll introduce you to other girls. I have a teacher who is single. Our school librarian is also single. -Also-- -That's enough, Anjani. Please don't set me up anymore. You don't need that. You can only forget her if you're determined. It is hard, but it can be done if you put your mind to it. All it takes is 21 days. Are you serious? I'm serious. There's a theory about it. The Law of 21 Days. The challenge is living up to the rules. What are the rules, Pet? Anjani, Jat needs to block all of Saras' social media accounts for 21 days. "My oath for 21 days." "First, I won't chat with her on WhatsApp and Line, and I won't stalk her on Instagram, Twitter, and Facebook." "Second, I won't engage in any activity that will bring me closer to Saras." "Third, I will delete all pictures and discard any memories of her." "I will do all this for 21 days." Sign that. Don't forget to get rid of that bear too. Don't let your memories ruin your future. Are you still mad? Should I engage in your lame chit chat? Ever since I got on the train last night… all I can think about is you. You lied to me, Ras. You betrayed me. Do you think you deserve to be here? I understand, Jat. I did something wrong. But a guilty person can still miss someone, right? You miss me? Do you think I am a doormat that you can stomp on with "I miss you"? I get it. I get why you hate me. But I just want… to spend time with someone I truly love before I leave this city. But you're absolutely right. I'm not worthy of you anymore. Forgive me, Jat. I'm sorry for wasting your time. You… Take care of your health. Don't get sick. If you get sick… I'd be really sad. Ras. Where are you going? Let me drive you. Can I ask you for two things? First, I'd like you to come to my graduation. -Why? -Well… you helped me finish my paper. Okay. The second one? The second one… I miss your coffee. Someone's looking more handsome. How are things? Do we have a lot of customers? No, we just opened. The smell of someone who has moved on is certainly different. Amazing! I need to talk to you. I know, it's hard. Just listen first. I understand. You don't have to explain. You are so restless, I think… Kopet? I have to use the toilet first. I know how you feel, but please understand me, Pet. You just got robbed, Jat. But you just handed that robber a torch to burn your house down. That what's happening. Sorry, Jat. I don't want to understand this. Listen, Pet. I still have a chance. All I need is some time. No, what you need is someone who will smack your head and wake you up. -Why did you say that? -Why not? Where is the optimistic Kopet that I know? Don't talk about being optimistic this time, Jat. You need to be realistic! You're wrong! This is my chance, Pet, my chance to prove to Saras that I'm an amazing guy. Am I right? Amazing, my ass. You've disappointed me, Jat. You've disappointed me. Hey… Jat? -Yes? -Is the coffee ready? Yes. I mean, not yet. I'm making it now. Okay. Saras! -Congratulations! -This flower is for you. This is for you, Saras. -Ras! -Jat! Thank goodness you're here. -Thank you for coming. -Sure. This is for you. They're gorgeous. The flowers smell wonderful. Abdul? Abdul! You said you weren't coming. I wanted to surprise you. Congratulations. Thank you, Abdul. It's that boy again. Hey. Jat, can you take our picture? Here, just a moment. Okay? Come on, Abdul. Here's something to keep you smiling all day. Jat… do you like me? Do you… Do you want me to be your girlfriend? No. I mean, I do! Why do you want to be my girlfriend? Because you're always there for me and because you always make time for me when I need you. Please take care of your health. Don't get sick. You asked me to take care of myself, but you're the one hurting me, Ras. DAMN IT I know Saras came here. Because of her, you never picked up my calls. I didn't say anything… because I wanted to know… how long can you keep your words. Who pawned the vehicle ownership documents? Who forced me to get to know her? Now all you do is blame me. Blame you? All I do is blame you? I have been working my ass off this week, covering for you at the cafe. I'm behind on my studies because I've been getting home late. My teacher even got mad at me for falling asleep in class. -I-- -Did I ever ask you to cover for me? The flowers in front of the house never asked to be watered. That's just how I am. I know you're sad. You were miserable, so I tried to help. But I was wrong. I wasn't helping the brother that I know. Maybe I'm not your sister anymore. CLOSED FOR RENT Jatmiko? Jat. I want to take you and Anjani to see Lord Didi's concert, let's go. I got free tickets from Sobat Ambyar, Jat. Go talk to your sister, Jat. Ask how she is. Have dinner together.

Do you remember me telling you this before you bought Cafe La Vittoria? I told you that this coffee from Tinari tastes… absolutely delicious! You didn't drink this coffee when your heart was broken, right? Only your mom and dad's coffee could fix your broken heart. What? What's wrong with you, Jat? Are you possessed or something? -Let's find a shaman. -Come with me, Pet. Something is missing. I bought that gold necklace Especially just for you My love was so deep Just for you… He's crying.
