My children... From the very beginning... It was the children who gave me my power. The Springwood slasher... That's what they called me. My reign of terror was legendary. Dozens of children would fall by my blades. Then the parents of Springwood came for me... Taking justice into their own hands. When I was alive, I might have been a little naughty... But after they killed me, I became something much, much worse-- the stuff nightmares are made of. The children still feared me, and their fear gave me the power to invade their dreams. And that's when the fun really began! Aah! Until they figured out a way to forget about me! To erase me completely! Being dead wasn't a problem. But being forgotten-- now, that's a bitch! Aah! It's only a dream! Die, motherfucker! I can't come back if nobody remembers me! I can't come back... If nobody's afraid! I had to search the bowels of hell... But I found someone... Someone who'll make 'em remember. He may get the blood, but I'll get the glory. And that fear is my ticket home. Mike? Is that you? All right, fuck you, then. I'm heading in. Mike? Come on, it's not funny anymore. Ohh-aaah-aaah, aaah! Aah! Ohh... Oh... No! Jason. I should've been watching them, not drinking. Not meeting a boy at the lake. I deserve to be punished. We all deserved to be punished. Jason. My special, special boy. Do you know what your gift is? No matter what they do to you, you cannot die. You can never die. You've just been sleeping, honey. But now the time has come to wake up. Mommy has something she wants you to do. I need you to go to elm street. The children have been very bad on elm street. Rise up, Jason! Your work isn't finished! Hear my voice and live again! Make them remember me, Jason. Make them remember what fear tastes like. Ha ha ha ha ha ha. I've been away from my children for far too long. Marry, fuck, or kill? Your choices are-- your choices are the 3 stooges. Go, Kia. Oh, God... Uh, which one had the super bad toupee hair? Harry, moe-- no! No, no, no. It was moe. Either one, I'd kill him. Ok, who'd you fuck then? This is stupid, y'all. Come on. Come on. Oh, God. Whatever, look. I'd fuck the bald guy, and I'd marry Larry. Jesus. Is this what we're doing all night? 'Cause, y'all, this is really stank. Hey! Gibb, what are you doing? I thought you were gonna quit? I only smoke when I drink now. But you're always drinking. Yeah, well, I'll work on that next. Hey, ok. I got another one. Fred, Scooby, or shaggy. Oh! I'm not answering that, and neither is she. Do you guys think I should get a nose job? Oh, my God. Oh, please, Kia, what you need is a lobotomy. I think I'm gonna get some candles. I'm gonna get some beer. You guys want anything? Are you sure you should be driving? I'm so under the limit, Lori. Surprise. Oh, Trey. You answered my prayers. Thank you. Whoa, babe! What'd I tell you about kissing me after you smoked, huh? Lighten up. They're menthols. Yeah. I brought Blake. Where's Linda? It's Lori. This is her house, so don't be a total cocksmith. Whatever. Where are the ladies? Relax, they'll be here. I'm relaxed, man. I'm just wet. Did you know they were coming over? Listen, you gotta be quiet. Hey, we knew you were be here all alone this weekend. Blake's cute. He's not my type. Oh! Who is? No one's ever gonna live up to the fuzzy memory of your first love, Lori. You were fucking 14, so get over it. Yeah, I know we were young, but what will and I had was real. Well, correct me if I'm wrong, but didn't Mr. real just drop-kick your ass without so much as a good-bye handshake? He ever even call or maybe even write to you after he moved? Send you an e-mail? No. You see my point? It's time to leave the convent, Lori. You need to meet a guy. Uhh. Hey, Lori, I, uh, I like the... Flow of your place. Got good feng shui. Yeah. You know about feng shui? Oh, oh! Oh, you should see her bedroom! Hmm? Great flow in there. Lori, why don't you go upstairs and show Blake your feng shui. Shut up! I got a kink in my neck. Come on. You can massage it out for me. I think I need a few more drinks before there'll be any massaging. What do you see in him? I don't know, but he has a cute ass. Babe, don't make me ask you twice, ok? So, Lori... Am I gonna get that grand tour or what? Yeah. You know, why don't you start in the kitchen, and get us some beers. Cool. Oh, my God, Kia, he is a total idiot. Get him out of here. Oh, Lori, come on, give him a chance. I don't like him. You know what? You don't like anybody. I mean, Lori, you've barely gone out since-- since what? Since my mom died? Yeah, well, you know what? My dad needs me. So I can't just go out with guys all the time, and if I did, it would not be with somebody like Blake. Yeah, fuck me, baby! Aah! Aah! Your back door was open. I closed it. Mm. Babe, you know I don't like to be touched after, ok? Fine. I'll go have a shower then. Good. Your hair smells like menthols, anyway. Asshole. Ahh. Ohh! Aah! Unh! Aah! Ack! Aah! Trey! What the hell are you doing? Aah! Aah! Help us! Help us! Oh, my God! Over here! Please help us! Help us! You kids need some assistance? What the fuck do you think?! We need to lock this down now. Keep it contained, you hear me? Killed in bed. Jesus. It's even the same damn house. 1428 elm. It's gotta be him, right? It's gotta be Freddy Krueger. Hey! Don't even say that son of a bitch's name out loud. Let's just keep it together. We've been through too much to let this thing spread now. Take all the kids down to the station. Keep them separate. Do it now. Yes, sir. We'll be in touch. Thank you. Let's go home. So? She doesn't know anything. None of them do. I'm pretty sure we're good. Pretty sure? You better make damn sure none of those kids knows anything, or I'll send your ass up to westin hills with them. Knows what? What do you mean? Good work there tonight, Stubbs. Right place, right time. But we'll take it from here, all right? Your father's on his way. Do they know who did this? No, not yet. But I thought I heard one of the officers mention a name. You know, to tell you the truth, Lori, I--I just moved here about a month ago, but if they have a suspect, I'd be the first to know. But they asked me all these really weird questions, like about my dreams-- What was the name? What was the name? Freddy. Hello? Are you ok? Ohh! His name is Freddy Krueger. And he loves children, especially little girls. Freddy's coming back. Soon he'll be strong enough. It's ok to be afraid. We were all afraid. Warn your friends. Warn everyone. Aah! Aah! Ohh! ? 1, 2, Freddy's coming for you ? ? 3, 4, better lock the door ? ? 5, 6, grab a crucifix ? 7, 8, try to stay up late ? ? 9, 10, never sleep again ? 1, 2, Freddy's coming for you ? aah! Ohh! Ohh. Blake, we have to talk. What the hell were you doing over there? You were supposed to be watching your sister. Were you drinking? My best friend was just killed, dad! So how about giving me some fucking space. You watch yourself, boy. I'm gonna get him for you, Trey. Cop let it slip. It was somebody named Freddy. I'm gonna take him out myself, Trey. I swear to God. Who is that? Someone there? Ohh! Jesus. Ha ha ha ha ha! I'm ok. I'm all right. Not strong enough yet. Well, I will be soon enough. Until then... Heh heh heh! I'll let Jason have some fun. Dad? Aah! Aah! Aah! Hypnocil. What does this shit do, anyway? How come we all have to take it? It keeps you nice and docile while I kick your little ass. I'm fine with that. We interrupt this program for a special report. After tonight's murder in this neighborhood of Springwood, the sheriff's department has confirmed that there is one victim... Hey, turn that up, man. Remain sketchy, but the sheriff-- sorry, will. You know the rules. Turn that back on. I know somebody that lives in that house. Come on, turn it back on, man! I never ask for anything. Just turn on the fucking TV, please! Fuck you, man! What the fuck is your problem?! What are you doing, man? You want 10cc's of that pink tranquilizer in your ass? That was Lori's house. They said something about a murder. I gotta-- I gotta go to her. I gotta see if she's ok. Back to Springwood? Do you want me to start having nightmares again? Don't start with that dream demon shit again. Ok? You know that's all just in your head. Yeah, yeah, and who are you, the poster boy for sanity? You're the one that told the cops Lori's dad killed his wife. Yeah, right, and now it looks like someone else got killed in the same house. You think that's a coincidence? 2 murders in one house? Kurt, how many times do I have to tell you, man? I don't do checkers. I'm an uno guy, all right? So go grab the fucking uno deck and we'll play, ok? Please. Thank you. Look at us, will. Look around you, man. We're institutionalized. We're stuck here. We're not going anywhere. I do miss my family, man. I mean, it's been 4 years since I've seen 'em, you know. All these years, and you're still convinced you saw her father do that? I know what I saw, mark. Fuck what the doctors try to get me to believe. I need to know if she's ok. You want to play? Uhh. Sweet dreams, monkey boy. What the hell was that for, man? Heh heh heh! You're a fucking lunatic, you know that? I know you are, but what am I? Are you sure you didn't see anyone? No, dad, none of us did. I already went over this with the police. It's just... I don't know what I'd do without you. You're all I have left. Dad, I'm not going anywhere. I promise. Look at you. You're exhausted. Lori. We need to get you to bed! Ohh! Oh! Um... I don't want to go to sleep, dad. I just want to see my friends. I don't think it's a good idea for you to go to school today. You've just been through a very traumatic experience. Dad, please... I just need to get out of the house, ok? I'll be fine. I promise. Well, at least drink your juice. Will rollins and the Davis boy escaped from westin hills last night. Oh, Jesus. It's all coming apart again. Don't worry. We'll find them. Keep this thing contained. Lori! Oh, my God! God, you guys, I'm so glad you're here. Uh, Blake's dead, too. What? Yeah, he-- he was stabbed to death late last night. Um, same with his dad. What? Shit, shit! This is bullshit! The police are blaming everything on Blake like its some kind of columbine thing or something. They're saying he went crazy. Killed Trey, killed his dad, and then took his own life? This is so fucking messed up. This is messed up. Excuse me. Sorry. Uh, Lori? What is it, Linderman? Um, well, I heard what happened, and I just wanted to express how, um-- well, to tell you how sorry I was. Thank you. That's sweet. Right. You know, actually, if you need anybody to talk to or-- whoa, Linderman, let me give you a tip. Place your hormones back in the box and quit while you're ahead, ok? We don't have time for date-a-dork right now. Thanks. Right. Uh, sorry. I swear, every day it's the same thing. He's like one of those fucking frou-frou dogs that keeps humping your leg. Give a couple to some ladies. Thanks, man. I see what you're saying, Gibb, but that's exactly why you should go. I mean, be amongst friends where it's safe. There's gonna be a whole lot of loving there for you and my boy Trey, all right? Yeah. Yeah, you're right. I should go. I could use a few dozen drinks. That a girl. Let your freak flag fly. See you there. You want to go? No, I don't think so. I--I didn't get much sleep last night, and when I did sleep, I had the most terrible nightmares. Lori, you had to sleep at a police station. I'd have nightmares, too. No, no, no, it wasn't like that. I mean, this was really real. I mean, there was this man, but he more like a monster really, and they kept calling him Freddy, and he was so real. Shh! What did he look like? He--he had this... Dark brown hat, and... His skin was terribly burnt, and on this right hand he had this like these razor fingers, and-- You must be tripping. No, no, no! And then there were these little girls... It's ok. It was a bad dream. They were singing like this--this song like-- ? 1, 2, Freddy's coming for you ? you know why they sing that? Because that's when he comes for you... In your dreams. You're lucky to be alive. Who is he? He's a child murderer that some parents from around here burned alive, but then he came back. Back for revenge in our nightmares. Funny no one ever told us about him, huh? Ok, thank you! No! Want some free advice? Coffee. Make friends with it. Mark! That's enough. You're scaring her. Will? Hey. Uh... I thought you might be in trouble, so we-- Lori! Oh, my God! Lori, honey, wake up! Someone get help, please! Someone get some help, please! The principal! Will, let's go, let's go! Please, somebody help her. Lori? How much longer is it gonna take? Is she ok or what? Shh. Tsk! For nose jobs, what kind of anesthesia do the doctors use? They put you all the way under, right? Ohh! Got your nose! Aah! Ohh! Strong work, man. I came to make sure she's ok and you put her in the infirmary. What were you thinking about, telling her all that stuff, man? I mean, we're not in group. Because I'm thinking for the first time in my life that maybe I'm not crazy, that my brother wasn't crazy. She had the same dream, will. Will rollins! Mark Davis! This doesn't make any sense. There's nothing on Krueger. Not his arrest, his death, not even a birth certificate. Whole sections of the records are gone. Look at all these blacked-out obituaries. January 18th. That's the day my brother committed suicide. Why isn't that in here? I don't know! But I'm sure there's a good reason. I mean, remember in group when they told us not to jump to conclusions. Listen to yourself. You're holding onto that psychobabble bullshit like it's some kind of security blanket, man. Let it go. They covered him up, will. They never told us about Freddy because that's how they decided to beat him. They treated him like he was a fucking disease, and they locked up all the kids who had made contact with him so they wouldn't infect the others. That's crazy? Is it? How come we were never allowed to call any of our friends, man? How come none of our friends ever called us? We were in a fucking quarantine, man. That's what westin hills was for. Well, even if all you're saying is true, then why didn't Freddy kill Lori? Maybe he's not strong enough yet. My brother said it's our fear that gives him his power. Yeah, well, you sure as hell spread enough fear today at school. Holy shit. You're right. They wanted to forget Freddy so they wouldn't fear him-- what if I screwed up the town's plan? No. Fuck! This fucker's gonna spread like the plague, man. Kids are gonna start falling asleep, it's gonna-- let's leave, man, let's leave right now. No, I can't leave. Why not? I gotta go talk to Lori. I gotta see if she's ok. Well, is she worth dying for? Because if you fall asleep, you ain't waking up. Yeah, well, if that's the case, how come you're not dead? Or any of the freaks at westin, huh? When's the last time you even had a nightmare? I don't know. I can't remember my dreams anymore. Look, just give me one night, ok? Just let me find Lori, and then we're out of here. I swear. All right. If your ass isn't back here by dawn, I'm gone. We clear on that? This baby's my brother's pride and joy, so be careful. Oh, shit. Linderman! Uh, shack, I don't drink. Hi, Lori. Didn't think I'd see you here. Uh, can I get you something to drink? Smooth opening, but, you know, we're already taken care of. What happened to your clothes? Oh, this. Uh... I was playing a drinking game with some of the, uh, lower primates, and I guess I'm penalized for my ability to read above a fourth grade level. Linderman, you know, I always pictured you as a straight up bed wetter. You know what, Kia? I used to think you hated me because you thought I wasn't good enough for Lori, but that's not it. You see, you tear me down to make yourself feel better because you really hate yourself, which is kind of pathetic when you actually stop and think about it, assuming, of course, you can think with all that make-up weighing down your head. The cops said Blake committed suicide. Apparently, it was grief over Trey. No, man, that's bullshit. I heard some guy Krueger killed them both. Said his name to my parents, they almost shit themselves. Yeah, yeah, yeah, man, and I heard that Freddy freak, he used to live here. Fucking gutted Trey like a goddamn Turkey, man. Like I heard his intestines and shit was on the floor-- oh, shit. I'm sorry. Oh, my God. Look who's here. Look who's here! What are you looking at? Come on, come on, let's dance. Come on, Linderman, let's go. Where have you been, will? Didn't you get my letters? What letters? They must've never even mailed them. Heh! Who? The... Doctors at westin hills. I've been in a psychiatric hospital. Uh, mark was with me there. Some other kids, too. I don't understand. Well, I saw on the news the other night, I mean, that kid that was killed at your house. I mean, I needed to know that you were safe. What happened? I don't know. I don't know. Nobody knows. Nobody saw what happened, and the police have been acting really weird, like they know something, and I heard them mention some name. Some... Freddy. Freddy Krueger. Where was your dad? Out of town. Are you sure? What is going on, will? Well, look, 4 years ago, I thought I-- Enough with this bullshit talk. Let's go shake our ass on the dance floor. Come on! I'm dead one day and you're already out getting shit-faced? Same old Gibb! Trey, I-- I can't believe it-- come on, let's go. Babe, don't make me ask you twice, ok? Now! Trey? Trey? Oh. Trey? Trey? Trey! Ohh! Aah! No! Open the door! Please, the door-- aah! Ohh! Aah! Aah! Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha! No! No! Aah! You're the one that killed Trey! Oh, don't worry about my little errand boy. The only to fear is fear himself! Aah! Uhh! Oh. Aah! Aah! Aah! No! She's mine. Mine! Mine! This everclear is kicking my ass. This--ha ha ha! Check out this fucking guy. Well, hey, Jethro! This is a rave, not a Halloween party. Why don't you go find yourself a pig to fuck? Yeah! Invite only, cornpoke. And you weren't invite-- son of a bitch. Uhh! Yeah! Burn, mother fucker! Ohh! No! Uhh! Run, man, run! Aah! Freak! You killed my brother! Whoa! Gibb! Oh, my God! Oh, Gibb! No! Let's go! Let's go, come on! Was that him? The guy you were talking about? Freddy Krueger? No, that wasn't the guy in my dream. That was somebody else! Who cares about some fucking dream guy, ok? That psycho in the hockey mask was real. Dude, that goalie was pissed about something. We need to find the police. No, no! Fuck the police! Just take me home, will. Gibb, I-- I can't believe she... I know. I know. Look, call me later, ok? Please? Just to check in. Ok. Bye, will. Be careful. Will, I'm gonna go inside now. No, I think that's the last thing you should do right now. Oh, will, please. After everything that's happened, I just want to go to-- there's more to it than that. Look, I tried to tell you this earlier. The reason I was sent to westin is because I saw your dad kill your mom. Will, my mom died in a car accident. No, that's what he wanted you to believe, but I was there, Lori. I was sneaking up to your room like I used to do. Only you weren't there. I saw him kill her. Dad! Get out of the van. Get out of the van! Where were you? What are you doing? I've been looking all over for you! Get away from her! You're in a helluva lot of trouble, you know that? Yeah, like I give a shit anymore. Get in the house! You! I'm taking you back to westin. No! No way! You can't trust him, Lori. Whatever you do, don't go home with him! No, listen to me! Lori, he was the one who had me committed! See, you didn't understand. You still don't. You were confused! Stop it! Both of you, stop it! Damn it, will! I am not gonna let you endanger my daughter again! Not after everything that's happened! Stop it! Stop it! Fuck! Lori! Lori! Lori! Lori! I--I-- did mom die in a car accident? Yes. Of course she did. Prove it. Show me a death certificate. Show me an autopsy report. Lori, I don't think now is the right time-- really, dad? Because I think it's a perfect time! Why didn't you tell me about westin hills? Do you work there? Because I thought you were a fucking general practitioner! Yes, I... I do some consulting there now, but... It's--it isn't what you think. Oh, my God. So you knew about will this whole time. Lori, listen to me. You're upset. We both are. Now I think what you need now more than anything is to get some rest. Why don't I give you some pills, and that'll help you sleep, and then we talk about it in the morning? I don't want to sleep, dad! I want to know why you've been lying to me! We'll talk about it in the morning! Now do what I say! Lori! Lori! Lori! Open this door. Open this door! Go away! Damn it, Lori! Let me in! Lori! Goddamn it! Lori! Lori! Aah! It's ok, it's me. It's me, shh! Shh! You ok? Are you ok? It's me, all right? I don't know how your father's connected to all this, but I think mark was right. There's some kind of cover-up going on here with Krueger. We can't trust the police. We can't trust any of the adults. So what do we do? We gotta get to mark. He's the expert in all of this. He'll know what's going on. You always looked out for me, bro. Man, ghostly: Hey, mark. Just stay awake. Shit! Shit! Shit! Hey, mark. You didn't forget about me, did you? Oh, God. Oh, that's right! Everyone forgot! That's why they weren't afraid anymore! That's why I needed Jason to kill for me to get them to remember. But now he just won't stop, that hockey puck! Aah! Ha ha ha! Ha ha ha! This isn't... Real. Somebody, please, wake me up! Please! Mark! Mark, wake up! I need you to send a little message for me. That's all, just a little message. I'm not gonna do it. I won't do it! No?! I won't do it. I'll have to pass that message myself. Won't I, hmm? Aah! Uhh! Aah! Ha ha ha! Aah! Let go of me! Aah! Help... Me. Mark! Ohh! Aah! Pass on a little message for me, will ya? Uh, sheriff, I've been compiling info based on eyewitness reports of the hockey mask killer. We already know who did this. Sheriff, we closed down the school and set up a curfew for anyone under 18. Good. Now I want 24 hour roadblocks set up. Nobody leaves town, nobody gets in. We're gonna contain this son of a bitch before he spreads any further. Yes, sir. Sir, shouldn't we have the FBI come in and-- no outsiders, Stubbs. We can handle this. We've stopped him before. Ok, I'm a little lost here. Stopped who before? We don't say his name out loud. You're not from around here. I don't expect you to understand. With all due resect, sheriff, I think we have a copycat of the old Jason Voorhess crystal lake killer on our hands-- you listen to me. We do things around here a certain way for a reason. And that's given us 4 years of peace. So you either do your job and keep your mouth shut or, so help me God, I will lock you up! Do you understand me?! Do you understand?! Yes, sir. Why don't we all just leave? No, even if we leave, Freddy can still get us. We all know about him, we're all afraid of him. It was our fear that gave him his power. We're marked now. Man, screw that clown. I mean, what kind of a pussy comes after you in your dreams anyway? Now that big ass mother fucker back at the cornfield, all right, that's who we should be afraid of. Tell me who the fuck that was. His name was Jason Voorhess. Uh, shit, man... Um... How'd you know we were here? Nothing personal, but the Scooby van out back wasn't exactly subtle. And never keep your keys in the door. Great, so now we're completely fucked. No, you're not. I'm here to help you. Now, this Jason Voorhess supposedly drowned at camp crystal lake back in 1957 when he was 11 years old. The counselors weren't watching him, then they made the mistake of killing his mother. The legend has it that Jason kept returning from his grave to punish whoever returned to the camp. I think we're dealing with a copycat here. No. No. No, no, no. He's not a copycat. I've seen what he can do. He's the real Jason. That's impossible, Linderman. Jason is dead. Yeah. Well, you'd better start thinking outside your little box, dude. 'Cause somebody's definitely breaking the fucking reality rules, ok? It makes sense in a way. I mean, what if Freddy brought Jason back because he was too weak to go after us on his own, so he used Jason. I mean, he knew that we'd think it was him, that we'd spread the fear again. And now that it's working, it's like he can't shut Jason back down. Wait a minute. Freddy died by fire, Jason by water. How can we use that? I think we should concentrate on Jason first. But I thought we decided that Freddy was the one pulling the strings. Shouldn't we go after him first? I don't know, maybe what we need to do is to offer Freddy a sacrifice. Yeah, yeah, totally. Like a virgin, right? Someone pure. Dude, don't look at me. Even if you pay for it, it still counts. Oh, come on. Look, we all know who the real virgin is here. Kia! Come on, Lori. I know you never made it with will. Why would he want to when he can fuck somebody like me? Let's tie the bitch up. What? Don't worry, angel. You've still got me. Come on, give daddy a kiss. Aah! Your eyes say no-no, but my mouth says yes-yes. Aah! Aaaaah! Lori, are you all right? You fell asleep. Ohh! Oh, shit! I pulled that out of my dream. How is that possible? Anything is possible now! God, you just don't get it! Oh, God, y'all, 2 killers? We're not safe awake or asleep. It's not the sleep that's killing us, it's our dreams. At westin, mark and I never had dreams. Were you on any drugs? Yeah, but there's something called hypnocil. They never told us what it was for, but everyone there was taking it. Hypnocil. Experimental drug... Not even approved yet by the fda. Oh, shit. Used for... Suppression of dreams. We need those pills. Enough for all of us. Can you get us back to westin hills? All right, this isn't it, guys. Come on, let's go. Hey, dude. Let's take a little j-break, huh? No, man. He's a cop. Oh, come on. What's he gonna do, arrest me? Hold up. Hang on a second. Fuck. Oh, that's better. Where's freeburg? Come on. Come on! This is d-wing. These are the ones who wouldn't stop dreaming. Are they dead? They're in a coma. It says they were given too much hypnocil. Who would do this to people? Your dad's name is at the bottom of both of these charts. Cool... Yeah. What the fuck? Nice. Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah. Hold up, man. What? What do you want? No, I don't know where the hypnocil is, ok? I can't pour these down the drain. We need this stuff. Uhh! Freeburg! Freeburg! Freeburg, what are you doing? We need those drugs! Dude, no! Dude-- aah! Go on! Get out of here! Go! Ohh! Aah! Aah! What was that? Let's go check it out. Let's go. Get back! Shit! Hell! Fucker! Help me! Shit! They're all empty! We gotta keep looking. Maybe there's some down here. Damn, it's gotta be here somewhere. Aah! Aah! Freeburg, come on! Come on! Come on! What are you waiting for, come on! Freeburg, time to go. We gotta go! Now, come on! Let me handle this, bitch. What? Come on, come on! Ok, let's go! Let's go. No, wait, wait! Look. Come to Freddy. These are my children, Jason. Go back where you belong! Ohh! Fuck you! Linderman... These are my children, Jason. Go back where you belong. Jason... Jason... My special, special boy. I'm disappointed in you, Jason. You disobeyed me. You were supposed to come back home, just kill a few of them! But I blame myself. I should've known you wouldn't be able to stop killing! You are like a big, stupid dog who can't stop eating, even though your master said you've had enough! Ha ha ha. Now it's time to put this bad dog to sleep... For good! Haaa! Aah! Aah! Not my arm! Aah! Ha! Welcome to my nightmare. Penny for your thoughts, chief! Uhh! Oh, scary. Ha ha ha ha ha! Uhh! Ha! Ah ha ha ha ha! Ah ha! Ha ha ha! Ha! Ohh... Tilt. Ahh! Ah ha ha ha ha! Why won't you die?! Aah! Argh! Aah! Uhh! Come on. Come on! Ahh. So you are afraid of something after all, huh? Ah ha ha ha ha! How in the fuck did I let y'all talk me into this? Why don't we just try and do it here? Why go all the way to crystal lake? - Best-case - Jason wins. He'll already be home, back where he belongs. I mean, why follow us anymore? And if Freddy wins? At least Jason has home-field advantage. Ahh. Aww... How sweet. You ugly little shit. Now there's a face... Only a mother could love! Ha ha ha ha ha! Yeah! Now we're getting somewhere. Let's see what really scares you. Ohh. And dig a little deeper. I'm dying to see what skeletons are hidden in your closet. Ok, we're seriously running out of tranq here, guys. Ok? I got maybe one dose, plus enough for Lori. Well, we're almost there. Then I better get going. No, no, just... I don't want you to go. I'm coming back. Just give me 15 minutes, then wake me up. I'll bring that bastard Freddy back through. Just make sure Jason's waiting for him. Now I lay me down to sleep. Children, chanting: Freak show! Freak show! Freak show! Freak show! Bull's-eye! Freak show! Freak show! Freak show! Try this on! Ohh! Freak show! Freak show! Freak show! Stupid! Ohh! Ohh! Aren't you gonna help the kid?! Can't you see I'm busy here? You mean you're not coming? It's not my fault this bitch is dead on her feet. Ha ha ha ha ha! Aah! It's been 5 minutes. Well, that was the last of the tranq, ok? We're out. Calm down! Ok? Just relax! Heeeeelp! Wait! Give me your hand! Give me your hand! Aah! Help! Jason? Aah! Jason vorhees! Aah! Aah! Y'all... Y'all... Y'all, something's wrong. It's like he's drowning or something. Freddy must be killing him. We need him alive! Dude, what do you want me to do? Like, give him mouth-to-mouth or something? Um... Hell no. Why are you-- no! No, I'm not gonna do that. No! Kia, look, I would do it myself, but I've had asthma since I was 6, ok? I don't have the lung power. No. Kia, he has asthma! Ooh! Ooh... Look, you can do this, ok? You can do this. You just-- shut up! You're not the one that has to do this. I know, but I-- shut up! Aah! Oh, my God. Ohh, God! Oh, man. Oh, shit. Oh, shit. Aah! Aah! You! Aah! What's wrong, Lori? Miss your wake-up call? Aah! Hunh! Wake me up! I got him! I got him! No! Lori, come on! Wake up! Lori, wake up, please! Look! Guys, look. We're almost there. Help me. Come on. We gotta get her up. Come on. Start running. Start running. Wake me up! Daddy, don't! Daddy! No, daddy, don't! Freddy! It was you! I've always had a thing for the whores that live in this house. Aah! Lori, wake up! Oh, shit. It's him. He's here. Lori, come on! You gotta wake up! Uhh! Uhh... Ha ha ha! Oh, yes. Aah! My God! Ohh. Come on, Lori, wake up! Lori, please. Wake up! Lori, please. Lori, please. Aah! Go! Go, go, go! Ohh! Lori! Oh, you fuckin' asshole! Goddamn it! Aah! Welcome to my world, bitch. I should warn you, princess, the first time tends to get a little... Messy. Yah! Get away from her! Gah! Uhh! Linderman. Unh! Oh! Oh, no! Aah! Ahh! Die, you little bitch. Ha ha ha ha! Uhh! Ohh! Aah! Aah! Jesus, Linderman. You-- you're really hurt. No. No, no, no. Don't worry about me. Just a scratch. Just go get help, ok? What? You don't think-- look, I'm just gonna rest here a minute. Linderman-- I'm fine, Kia. Really. Now get out of here. Go get help. But you-- just go. Ok, ok, but... I'm gonna be back as soon as I can. Lori! Think you're so smart, huh, bitch? Freddy! How sweet... Dark meat. No! Kia! Let's go! Nooo! So you're the one everyone's afraid of? Tell me something. What kind of faggot runs around in a Christmas sweater? I mean, come on. Get real. You're not even scary. You're not even scary. And let's talk about the butter knives. What is with the butter knives? You trying to compensate for something? Maybe coming up a little short there between the legs, Mr. Krueger? Hmm. I mean, you got these teensy-weensy little things, and Jason has got this big ol' thing that's like... Ohh. Kia! No! No! Come on! Come on, Lori. Let's go. We can't help her anymore. No! I'm staying! Are you crazy? You got what you wanted. You pulled Freddy out, and now he's fighting Jason. Come on! What more do you want? He killed my mother, Will! It was Freddy. My dad covered it up to protect me. He didn't do it. Look, he has taken everything from us! He has ruined both of our pasts-- and I am not leaving until I see him die! Uhh! Unh! Uhh! Aah! Man the torpedoes. Hey, asshole! Up here! Aha! Ahh! Yeah. Ah, give me a break. Uhh! Ohh! Ahh! Aah! Ohh! Ohh! Aah! Aah! Aah! Aah! Ohh! Oh, no. Ohh, noooo! Ahh! Oh! Aah! Ohh! Lori, get the tanks! Give it up! Freddy! Go to hell! Ohh! Gah! Ohh... Uhh! Argh! Ahh! It's ok. It's ok. Aah! You... Ohh! Aah! Aah! Ohh! Welcome to my world, bitch!
