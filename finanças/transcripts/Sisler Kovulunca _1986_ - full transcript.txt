The Houses and Craftsmen of Old The Eastern Black Sea Region "When the Fog is Swept Away" We want Mother Good Luck, From God we want the sun. To him who gives - A thousand bounties. May foul rats devour the butter and cheese of him who does not give. When fog descends and you can hardly see The children come out and say the Sun Prayer When the fog is swept away... "We want Mother Good Luck, From God we want the sun." The children receive gifts of butter, cheese But we want the heroes of tomorrow's tales, the houses and craftsmen of old. Tastan Temur, the master-builder from Savsat. He's 104. He worked until he was 60, and gave up smoking at 75. He's glad to see his grandchildren's grandchildren, and that the houses he built are still standing. He can't remember just how many. My memory's gone. I'm getting old. The man who taught me was Master Sukru. Houses were built according to the log - cabin system, can be found mainly on the high plateau and inland areas of the region. In the buildings where nail-less dovetail technique is applied, generally chestnut and pitch pine are used. There is a corridor on the first floor. On the left, there are stables, cowsheds and fold. The floor slopes and channels to make cleaning easy. On the right are the winter quarters. The fireplaces in these rooms are used only in winter, open into stone chimneys. In summer, an important part of everyday life is spent in the porch of the second floor entrance. From the porch we enter into a large hall, of which a number of rooms open. The stoves on this floor open into the same chimneys as the ones on the floor below. At one end of the hall, with a very high threshold, there is a storeroom comprising many sections. In the bedrooms, under some of the divans, there are bathtubs covered by a flap. To keep everything stinky out of the house, the lavatories are, cell-like structures with a shutter, suspended from the balconies. Well, we built things - houses, schools, peace be to you! In Eastern Black Sea region, villages tend to be rather spread out. Densely built villages can only be found on plains at the foot of mountains or on inland areas on high plateau Even in August, snow can be seen on high plateau of the mountain ridge. Small water falls and streams flow by the snow that melts and the rain that falls all year round. Because of the steep slopes and the shortage of cultivatable land the settlements tend to have a dispersed pattern and the villages and small towns generally consist of scattered units. Because natural conditions are very harsh, the local people are very enterprising and very creative. In places where there are no bridges, They have to be creative enough to improvize cable lifts powered by simple motors, or even by their own muscles! When summer comes a migration starts from the coastal area to the plateau on the mountains in order to escape from the unbearable heat and humidity to find new pastures from the animals, to prepare hay for winter and to take part in festivities that are held on the mountain tops on certain days of the year. Neighbourhoods, villages and clans that have been separated from one another for a whole year by streams, valleys, peaks and the struggle of everyday life, come together, embrace and relieve the pain of separation. It is here that young men choose their future wives. On the temporary settlement which is a stopping place during the migration, or on the plateau, the houses are made of timber and are simple in design. Even the roofs are clad with shingles. Nowadays, these old wooden tiles are replaced by sheet iron. This is Ali Yagci the master-builder from Camlihemsin. He is 60. He can build a house in 1,5 - 2 months with the aid of his 3 assistants. I learnt my job from my uncle. I've built 87 houses far. I taught myself to read and write. We just visualize the sort of house we want here. There's no need for drawings. We use wooden pins here. We use dovetail joints in the vital points of the structure. Those particular joints stay tightly integrated -no matter what happens Houses where this joint technique is used stand up to earthquakes or blows of any kind. Concrete buildings aren't healthy to live in. Because it's damp here. You need to use wood. Chestnut is a very sound wood. It'll last for 150-200 years. When you're choosing a plot, you've got to remember that it snows a lot here, you've got to watch out for avalanches, blizzards, landslides, flooding. My name is Kasim Tavukcuoglu. I'm 98. I learned the building trade from my father. Kasim Tavukcuoglu, who gave up his job 8 years ago when he was 90, still lives with his wife in the house he built himself 60 years ago in the village of Ikizdere. Among the building techniques that Kasim uses are cellular half-timbered construction, a common practice in the region. Cells are infilled with a mixture of stone and adobe. The infilling is then plastered with lime. I do a sound job. I've built 160 houses, and nobody has ever complained. Everybody said: "May God reward you" A house that Kasim and his father built in 3 months in 1919 is still standing. My father was Halil. He was a real craftsman. They said, "Master Halil, your apprentice is better than you!" "You are right," he would say. "Sons are always better than their fathers." In the cellular half-timbered construction technique wealthy people prefer infilling with special hewn stones... The infilling is of either stone, adobe or hewn stone, it was all done according to a certain standard. Whether the house was to have 9 or 99 windows, certain standards were borne in mind when building these old houses. And no master-builder ever deviated from these standards, he couldn't. Master builder Kasim Tavukcuoglu says: "if there's no infilling, the house is cold Despite the interior wooden paneling the cold gets in between the timbers. When it's filled, the wind can't get in. You can't live in concrete in this region because of the humidity. The concrete will pull you like a magnet. Stone and wood... The people of the Eastern Black Sea region use those two basic building materials throughout the house, for health purposes. With those two noble elements, The masters have achieved new synthesis reflecting aesthetic values. An inseparable part of the old houses is the "serender", or barn. Foodstuffs such as hazelnuts, maize, flour, potatoes and beans are kept in these buildings. "Serender"s are built with the nail-less dovetail technique like most wooden houses. When necessary, they can be dismantled and rebuilt elsewhere. All necessary measures are taken to prevent vermin, mainly mice from getting at the foodstuff in the serender. At the same time, it has grids which ensure constant ventilation to protect the stored food from mold and rotting due to the humidity. Another component is "merek" a structure where hay or straw can be stored. The creative intelligence of the people of this region can also be seen in their tobacco-drying racks. These racks are set on wooden slipways which enable them to be brought to a vertical position under cover when it starts to rain. With a similar creativity, movable drying racks have been installed on the balconies of some houses. Dilaver brothers: Muslim the master builder is 78 and his brother Ismail is 68. They live in the house they built themselves in a village near Surmene. The technique they mostly use is "muska" subdivision of a half timbered structure. The triangular frames are filled with a mixture of mud and stones. As a rule, metal nails are used to fix the diagonals in this type of construction which is wide-spread in the region. The Dilaver brothers have built more than 400 houses to date They are proud to say that not a single house they built has ever collapsed. Nobody has ever said there was a defect in the work I did for him. I've built 487 houses - it's written in my diaries My father always said to me: "One window in a room should be without bars. If there is a fire, you can't get out if all windows have got bars" Omer Kelesoglu is from lkizdere. He is 81. Because the active population of the village has gone away to work in big cities, he volunteers for a number of jobs such as making the stairs for the village school. Since it's too rainy during the school season, The children would often slip and fall down coming to school, he says. Omer also deals with running repairs on his neighbours' houses Omer's expertise is seen mainly in the houses he built, where he used the "cakatura" technique. This involves filling the spaces between the vertical members of the structure with a mixture of mud and stones. Omer says that he always visualized the house in his mind, and never made any drawings. I'm getting old. My life is coming to an end, and so is my work. If had my life all over again, I'd go into the same trade. I'd like to learn my trade even better and make even better buildings for the prosperity of the people. I had no education, and education is an important thing. This is Ali Riza Alioglu, the master-builder from Surmene, and the house he built using the "muska" technique. This house was his first work. This old house and its creator have withstood the ravages of time together for 70 years and continue to do so. Ali Riza, who is 92, says: I built this house first of all. I spent my wedding night here... My wife died in this house... I shall die in this house, too. I started to learn my trade when I was 13. Ali Riza, who started with triangular framed half timbered construction, later built houses using the "bagdadi" technique. Ali Riza says that he owes his health and sprightliness to the house that he built with his own hands and has lived in ever since. As he said: The houses and barns that he built are just like living people - they breathe. Fifty years ago, when Ali Riza was adding an extra storey to a house in Surmene, he became famous. I didn't add that extra floor to the top of the house, but to the bottom! he says I raised the house and propped it up on both sides. The whole of Surmene crowded round to watch. The mayor himself came and warned me if anyone got hurt, I would got the blame. And I got the job done in 2 days! That famous house, has been standing for the past 50 years! The craftsmen of old made everything themselves, from door and window frames to the decorations on the eaves. Ali Riza wanted to immortalize the hand of his beloved daughter, who was just 3 days old at the time: this he did by carving the hand reaching a bunch of grapes on the door of a house he built The old town houses in the Eastern Black Sea region were usually built according to the "bagdadi" technique. In this technique thin strips of wood that have been nailed to "muska" or "cakatura" type walls plastered over. It provides heat and sound insulation. We can see a large number of welcoming houses in Akcaabat, built according to the "bagdadi" technique. The layout of these houses, which do not block one mother's outlook, are constantly ventilated by skylight windows adheres to the traditional division into women's quarters (harem) and men's quarters (selamlik) The two rooms which open into the entrance hall were the "men's quarters" of old. On the second floor there were bedrooms that also belonged to the "men's quarters" In the "women's quarters" there was kitchen accommodation and living rooms opening off the ground floor corridor and bedrooms on the either side of the corridor above. This is master Kahraman, the mason. He is 60. He has been wielding a hammer since he was 9. It is intelligence that matters more than strength in a mason's work. Your intelligence tells you how to tum a stone easily that a wrestler couldn't turn. Kahraman learnt his craft from his father and he in turn learnt it from his own father. Two master builders can built a normal house with stone walls in a month. If there is going to be stone carving, it'll take two master builders three months to do it. The old stone masons would proudly sign their names on all their works. In this region, stone was the symbol of nobility, wealth and power. The craftsmen of old have created magnificent examples of harmony in wood and stone. The climatic conditions in this region require the eaves of a house should be as broad as possible. This to a great extent prevents rainwater from running down the walls. Some builders, in order to ensure ventilation for the house, do not cover the facing boards on the underside of the eaves. Others do, especially where the location is windy. But the covering of the facing boards would be left convex, in accordance with the rules of aerodynamics. The fireplace occupied a very important place in these old houses and while the house was lived in, it never went out. The big room which the fireplace was located was the place where the family and their guests took their meals together and enjoyed themselves. The rooms and halls on this floor were also placed around of this common area. In this region at one time there were waterside residences too. Houses built by old craftsmen that has faced the rough waves of Black Sea for generations. However, in recent years many of them have been rooted by the coastal road and only a handful have survived to tell the tale. This is 86 year-old master builder Mustafa Turna from Rize. He is also known by his carpenter's tools which he made with his own hands. I started in this trade when I was 15. I built my own house without even serving as an apprentice to a master. After that, people said: "It's not acceptable, you must serve as an apprentice." Then I joined to a master and worked for him. After making a few houses we split up. Mustafa says that the good old days are gone for them. When our Patron Saint "Habib-un Neccar" made a mistake then. According to the myth, our Patron came across Saint Elijah. His basket was full of money, he had earned. Saint Elijah asked him what was that in his basket. He didn't say there's money in it. He said, "There's sawdust." Elijah said: "May God bless your sawdust!" Since then, whatever we make we get a pile of sawdust!" One day in 1940 he had been asked to build a house with large windows. But he refused to build such a non-standard house. When the landowner insisted, He made his first compromise and it was he who built Rize's first large-windowed house. On the other hand, 92 year-old Ali Riza who became famous by adding an extra storey to the bottom of a house in Surmene still refuses to compromise. Until now, he has denied to even set foot in the modern building designed and built by his architect grandson in the garden of his house. "This region is so damp and rainy. So we can not live in concrete buildings. If you go to that house, the doctor goes in, too." he says, and is then lost in thought. It's hard to understand whether he is thinking about the past or the future. When fog descends and you can hardly see The children come out and say the Sun Prayer When the fog is swept away... We want Mother Good Luck, From God we want the sun. As gifts for the children, We want tales of the houses and craftsmen of old.
