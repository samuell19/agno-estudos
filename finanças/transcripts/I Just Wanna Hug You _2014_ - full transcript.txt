English subs by AyuWorld @ KeikoWorld. Re-edited by KL. Enjoy! "This is based on a true story." January 25, 2014 Foul! Foul! Foul! Free pass! Ow, Ow... That hurts. Ah, Nagomi! - What are you doing? - Sorry... Please take care of him. If he keeps on doing this, we could lose. We told him not to, but he still does it. It can't be helped since he's your son, after all. You never listened to anyone either. If you don't behave, I'll tell your mother in heaven! Ah, I'm sorry. Got it? Ah, so loud! - Ah... Nagomi! - Here he is! Let's drink, Uncle. You've drunk a lot already. The beer is like plain water. Right, Nagomi? Whatever... Nago-chan, come here! Come on! Masami, hey! Why did you take him?! Look, he just takes him away. Nagomi. Nagomi! - Wanna drink? - Okay. Actually, I used to like Tsukasa a little bit. I knew that. Toshio too, right? No... Tsukasa was really a very strong person. I always got scolded by her. If only Tsukasa was alive again... I won't lose to her this time. Impossible. Maybe... This time, I'll certainly defeat her. Okay, let's drink. Okay, thank you. Nagomi, no. That's an offering for your mom. Come on, give it back. Why did Mom die? We talked about this many times already, didn't we? Can't she come back to life again? That's not something that can happen. Nagomi. If you wanna know more about your mom, then look at this. Read this. What is it? I've read this to you before, you remember? Yeah. Want to read it again? Yes. Okay. Listen carefully till the end, okay? "October 2nd, sunny day. Boccia training." (Boccia: game like lawn balls for disabled people) "That Toshio..." "If he didn't have the desire, he should just stop playing." February 10, 2008 I'm going to change clothes. You don't have to! It's useless even if you change now. I reserved it first. We are going to use this place. You can't. We also have reserved it on the internet. We called the people here and already talked about it, and rightfully reserved this place. Right, Toshio? Yes! What do you think? We gave the priority to these people already. Alright, just give it to them. What does that mean? This is not our fault, but the way talked with that under-estimating tone... I can't accept it. Huh? I didn't mean it like that. If it bothered you, sorry. You! You think that we're disturbing and want to quickly get off of here, right? If so, what should I do? Anyway, can we go now? Um... can we just divide the place in two? Although, it may be smaller than usual. Concentrate, Toshio. You have to throw it properly. Don't throw like we're in training. Do the same tension when throwing in the actual competition. That's the trick to winning. Do you have someone to pick you up? (Tsukasa thought he asked, "Do you have a leg?") I still got my leg. That's not what I mean. How do you get home? I have to go buy something first. I usually call the taxi to go home. Oh! If so, you want a ride? You want me to get angry? No, you don't have to pay me. Anyway, my working hours for today has finished. Sorry. - Pull the white one. - This one? Okay. I'm going to lift you up. Ready, go. - I'm going to put you down. - Okay. Sorry. Have we met before? Nope, why? You seem very nice to me. Ah, really. - I'm going to close it. - Okay. Can you fold it? Ah, yes. I'll try. Where's your house? Kitami direction. Eh, Kitami? Not the city direction? Didn't I tell you I gotta buy something? The muffler (scarf) fits you well. It's cheap stuff. Oh, I see. But... Thank you. You're welcome. Can you look forward while driving? I don't want to get into an accident again. Okay. I forgot. What? I forgot what I wanted to buy. Eh? - Here. - Thank you. Then, you forgot to write on the memo, so you wouldn't forget things? Well... yeah. My memory, sometimes, it just disappears like that. Lately, it has started to improve, but sometimes, it happens. But, nevermind. - Is that so? - Yeah. Whoa, this is delicious. Right? This is delicious, isn't it? Really delicious. How to say it... The sweet taste is very soft? Yeah. It's very soft. But you're great. You can remember and say things like that. Eh? No... Is that so? But this is really good. So there's also a store like this. It seems your place is close to my house. Where is it? At the corner near the bank, there's a mini-mart, right? My house is in the building behind it. The building that's in the same line with it? Yes, the second floor from the front. Um, the key... Oh, put it there. Okay, and these? Hey, have tea first. Eh? But... Hurry up! It's cold. Then, ojamashimasu. (greeting used when entering someone's house) Please sit over there. Okay. Can you help me turn on the heater? Sure. - Done? - Yes. It's on. I can take it. Thank you for the food. - Hot, isn't it? - Yep. Seems that you live alone. I have someone to help around the house, but she's gone home now. But... I can handle it if it's just like this. Really? Hey, Boccia, that's the game earlier, right? If you want, I can carry you to the bed. It's fine. Good-bye. Why does she never notice my kindness? What? You've been dumped again? I'm thinking to be a taxi driver in Hawaii. Eh, really? It's too cold in Hokkaido. The women's hearts here are cold too. In a warm place, their hearts may be warm. By only listening to it, you'll be able to speak English. How are you doing? What? That's useless, apparently. Even if it's not through words, it surely can be overcome. I don't really need words. Communication is through feeling. This CD has 12 sets. I'll give it to you for only 20,000 yen! What? Hey, if it outs, then it's out, okay? Next, you guys. - Which one? Which one? - Red, red. - Correct? - It's close to blue, right? - I wanna play. I wanna play. - I wanna play too. Wait, who's next? Who is it, who? Kurumi-chan! Looks like the blue one is closer. - How was it? Are you doing okay? - I'm fine. If anything, just call me, okay? - Okay. - Alright. Tsukasa... Why do you want to be a volunteer? Because it's fun being with you guys. That means we're the people who encourage you. Want some? Give it to me. - Here. - Thank you. Not good. Yukari, in a moment, she will be out of here. In the end, a cute kid like her, whose parents died in an accident is being adopted. Not like me, who's ugly and has a parent who was a former convict. That's just sad. If so, why don't you try studying or playing sports? I don't like to study and I'm not good at sports. Then, you can be someone's bride. You can save money and then, do plastic surgery for your face. - Plastic surgery? - Yes. - You're right. - Yeah. Words can be expressed, but feelings can be contradictory. True, right? What's with you? Things are not going smooth with your girlfriend? Okay, tell me. If it's about love, just leave it to me. Can I tell my love life problems to you? Keep calm. Someone who has never been a professional preacher can be a pro consultant. Then, can I ask you something? Yes. - Tonden-san... - What? Honestly, what's love? How is it? In other words, it's the encounter of a man and woman, right? You feel it in your heart. You always wanna be with her that it becomes unbearable to be apart. Then, you realize... that you were born to meet with this person. You always wanna be with her and you wanna do something for her. With that kind of thinking, that is love, right? The moment you start to think like that, that's when you start to fall in love. Oh, I see. But, Tonden-san... How do we know what we feel in our heart is real love or not? Look, Masami, you just have to continue to believe it. Until the answer is there... Prepare yourself and step on the pedal as hard as you can. What you have to do is just believe it. Abashiri public gymnasium, woman in a wheelchair, one person, in the name of Yamamoto... I repeat, Abashiri public gymnasium, woman in a wheelchair, one person... Okay, Taxi 105 will be heading to Abashiri public gymnasium. Roger. Tonden-san, I'll go there. I wanna go to Kitami again today. Let's go! Do you remember what you need this time? Yes, I do. This one? Okay, let's go. Okay, I'm going to put you down. Here you go. The curry is delicious, right? The other day, we ate sweet desserts. Today is spicy food. Look! But... is it true that my measurement is the same as Toshio-san? It should be fine. Tsukasa-san, you really like to play boccia, right? During high school, I was allowed to ride my friend's car. The car ignored the red light. Then... Suddenly, it crashed. At the hospital, my consciousness gradually began to return. I was thinking that I'd been kicked by God. I was upset and said, "I will repay it." - Repay it? - Yes. How? By winning the gold medal in boccia. Even though boccia looks easy, but actually, it's pretty tough. If we hit the ball and reverse the position at the end... Then... Sorry. Wait for a bit, okay? Hello. Oh, really? It's okay if you really want to do it. But in another two weeks, I have a lot of work too. Sorry. If this works out, I want to work on it since it's a big contract. Still, I really love you, Masami. You love me too, right? Yeah. You are working now, right? Yes, till then... Who's that? Seems like he's an acquaintance, but I don't remember him. Eh? Just how many times we've met, I can't remember that person at all. Don't know why. Your memory just comes and goes like that. - Yes. - So you forgot him, huh? Maybe, one day, when I greet you, you might forget me too. This is Yoko-san, my helper. Hello. Well, see you later. Don't think nonsense. We are just friends. Oh, really? "We are just friends." Why are you dumping me? In fact, I've checked the salaries, loans and your apartment. I'm sorry. Ah! That hurts... Ow... Ow! I don't know how you can live alone. Anyway, our house is nearby. You can always come home once in a while. Plus, today is my day off, so you can stay here. Didn't you have a girlfriend? Actually, how should I say this... Honey, if you want to brush him... Here, don't forget to clean Tama's fur using this. Alright. Stop it already. His fur is all over the table. It's better than it being all over the floor. Yes, but it's easier to clean using that thing. - It's easier to collect it... - We have our meals here. - Eh? - I'm leaving. I'll come visit again. - Leaving already? - Yeah. - Going on a date? - What? "Will you go shopping with me if you are free tomorrow?" Hey, if I listen to this too, will I be able to speak English well? If I said "impossible," you'll surely study hard, right? Okay... We'll take turns, okay? Ow! Who was it? Who?! Ow, ow, ow... Apparently, Koyanagi is your friend too, huh? So what type of person was he during high school? He was very popular because he was the basketball champion. So tired... The children's energy is incredible. Yep, this is my job. They have children here in the evening too. Tsukasa, are you going out with this guy? Yes, she is. Am I? It does look like we're going out, huh? So since that moment, what happened? She doesn't talk when we're in the car and she doesn't answer my phone calls. Of course, she's like that, you idiot. Meeting a guy like you whom she only met three times and you easily talking about something like that in front of others... How does she know you're being sincere? You're too reckless. You haven't changed at all since high school. So how's your relationship with Saki? How did you know about it? This is a small city. Before this, she worked in Kinoshita. We broke up already. It happened right here. Then, are you serious with Tsukasa? It's true that I'm a stupid person, but I'm not that stupid to fool around with a person like Tsukasa. I'm thinking about it properly. Also, I know that she's afraid to love someone. But it depends on the person. I've tried my best to gather all my feelings. I know that you're not a bad guy. But you're too reckless. Do you understand? Hey, don't sleep! Wake up, stupid! You're here. What are you saying? You'll freeze out here! Wait a minute. - Are you okay? - Yeah. So cold... - Here, wipe your face. - Okay. I'll take this off, okay? Okay. Are you okay? Can you feel anything? No, it's weird. No? Wait a sec. Okay. It's frozen. Yeah, it's cold. If you need me, just call me. Please. If you call me, I'll come directly. But I can't if I have passengers. If not, I'll surely come as soon as possible. What's your answer? I need you anyway. What? I forgot. You forgot? Yeah, I forgot. Is that so? I'll help you. Hey, are we going out? What, you remember now? But I don't remember the moment you said you love me. I... want to go out with you, Yamamoto Tsukasa. Can we? I'll think about it. Eh? I will think about it. You want tea or coffee? Tea. I... wanna hug you. Then... Only three seconds. One... two... three. Okay, done! You didn't give into the mood at all. Because we're not officially going out. I'm going to measure it. Isn't this shirt's color too striking? Because you're too plain. With this color, it makes you look good. Really? Yes. How about me? It suits you well. Thank you. Next, Tsukasa-san. Okay. ♪ I'll take you away~ ♪ So come to me~ I thought you were already on the road. Why are you still upset? I'm not. How about you? Still haven't found new love yet? What did you say? Every second I live is filled with love. There's a professor I know who's really beautiful. She'd like to come here from Shanghai to examine clione (sea butterfly). Although I used to say that words aren't needed, there are words that you need to say, right? Yeah. "Wo ai ni (I love you)." Do you understand the meaning of these words? These are the most important words in life. "Wo ai ni?" Yes, "Wo ai ni." "Wo ai ni." Your voice is too soft. Say it directly from your diaphragm. "Wo ai ni." "Wo ai ni." "Wo ai ni." "I love you." "Wo ai ni." Wo ai ni. "Maa-san, have you ever read Helen Keller's autobiography? "Helen Keller who's blind and deaf asked Sullivan the meaning of the word "love." "Is love something like the smell of this flower?" Wow, a carousel. I can't wait to ride it. Yes, it's okay. Just bring it along. - Hello. - Hello, welcome. - Welcome. - Wow, carousel. Ah, sorry... I'm sorry. Welcome to the Dream Carousel. - Here's the ticket. - Here. Okay. Please enjoy it. - Thank you. - Thank you. Okay, which one? This pink one. - Pink? This one? - Wait. - What? - Please wait. Oh... We're sorry. This is for safety reasons, but the ride isn't allowed for this woman. Eh, why? It's nothing. Plus, there's someone accompanying her. What did you say? You didn't learn during your training, did you? We're sorry, but maybe, you can enjoy another ride. - But... - Wait. I can accept it if this is the jet coaster. Why can't she go on this kind of harmless ride? When there is someone accompanying her, it's weird. Are you saying that a person with this kind of body can't go on this ride here? I understand your feelings, but... We have to think about the security of our visitors here. This is the operational policy. Yes, but... Enough, Maa-san. It's okay. Alright, then we'll try something else. What are you doing? I thought that would make things interesting for you. Do it again then. Okay. Maa-san, you're great. Eh? How is it? Feel better? Yes, a lot better. Good. Maa-san. I don't know why I suddenly remember many things... As if I came here before. Eh? When did I go? With who? I remember now. What? The person who was with me at the theme park at the time... He was my boyfriend during high school. Oh, really? I went out with him for about a year during my third year in high school. When I was involved in the accident and regained my consciousness... One rainy day... Even though he didn't meet me anymore, I tried to call him. Actually, I did it without my mom knowing when I called him. And I asked, "Are we still in a relationship?" And he answered... "Yes, we're still in a relationship." I asked again, "Really? We're still in a relationship?" "But is it enough with the way things are going?" So I said to him... "It's better if we break up, right?" Then, he answered... "Yeah, seems so." Although, I didn't think that he would simply agree. Don't give me that face. This is not a sad story. It's just a story of the past. Hello, we meet again. I've noticed from earlier, but wasn't sure whether I should greet or not... Hello. Looks like you guys are having fun. At the theme park, right? Yes. I went there today too, bringing them along. Because my day off is during the weekdays, I lied to their kindergarten that they both caught a fever. Okay, well... If I leave them alone, I don't know what they'll do. Till we meet again then. Enjoy your dinner. Okay. So? Somehow, I feel that he's familiar... but as I thought, I still can't remember him. Over here. Are you sure it'll be okay? It's okay. If I get yelled at, I'll write to the newspaper to submit about this issue. I'm always with you at the rehabilitation center. But it seems that you don't recognize me. What's your name? I'm Junpei. - Junpei-kun. - Yes! - Junpei-kun, let's walk! - Yes, I'm Junpei. Okay. - Oh, it's on! - How beautiful. Okay, you're safe. - Yay. - Yay. Alright, let's send you guys to a beautiful dream world. Carousel, start! It's starting. Whoa, it's moving. Wow, that's high. - This is great, isn't it, Maa-san?! - Yeah. Hey, Maa-san... If you wanna run away, this is the right time. - What is this? - Huh? - What are you doing? - What? Can't reach. Yeah, pass the ball! Pass! Nice shot! Yes, nice shot! Keep going. Masami is late again? Yeah, but it can't be helped. Maybe, he's driving his passenger to a distant place. - Move, move! - Goro-san, look. She's my girlfriend. - Masami. - Yes? How about the beautiful girl from the real estate company? We broke up already. You're really moving beyond prediction, aren't you? I haven't even been accepted yet. Ah! Toshio, Shinta. Junpei! - Here, here. - Yep, we'll go there. Short skit of Toshio and Shinta. "At The Hospital." Next patient, please come in. What is it? - Doctor. - Yes? - Since yesterday... - Yes? - My body feels hot. - Your body feels hot... - I'm coughing. - You are coughing. My body is trembling. Your body is trembling... Alright. What's wrong with me? Yes, this is Cerebral Palsy. (a brain disease) This is a fever. Short skit. "At The Hospital, Part 2." Doctor, what's wrong with me? Nothing, you just caught a little fever. - Oh, fever, is it? - Yes. Doctor, I got work after this. So I have to get well as soon as possible. Can't I just get an injection? - Ah, alright. - Okay. - I'm going to inject you. - Yes, please. Alright, I'm going to start now. Ah, enough already. Thank you very much! - Is the Sake enough? - Everyone can take a shot. You wanna drink? Did everyone get some? Guys, don't force yourself to drink so much. Tsukasa too. Didn't you drink a lot already? Are you okay? Are you guys all drinking? Come on. Today, we are motivated. As drunk as this... I'm sorry. Are you Tsukasa's friend? Yes. I'm sorry. I'm Tsukasa's mother. Nice to meet you, I'm Koyanagi Masami. Maa-san, hold... I allowed her to live alone, so that she could become stronger, but... I'm sorry. Looks like you guys were drinking alone. No, there was other people too. I want to declare my relationship with Tsukasa-san. You shouldn't say something like that when you are drunk. Just go back now. Okay. I'm sorry. Excuse me. "Yesterday night, after a long time, I feel like I'm floating in the sky and dreaming." "Under my feet lies a sea of white ice. And there's a really big polar bear chasing me." "Then, my body is pulled by the polar bear. Maa-san, I'll be eaten by the bear. Help me!" Finally, I remember who he is. Honey. Tama's litter has run out. That's because your spending on Sake has increased. Changing it once a day is enough, right? How can I do that? If the toilet is dirty, Tama can't do his business comfortably. It's okay, right, Tama? Yes?! Sorry, it's me. Just come in. Is it my stupid son? She's my girlfriend. This is my dad, this is my mom. Nice to meet you, I'm Yamamoto Tsukasa. Your girlfriend? Ah, your friend, right? I want to marry her. What did you say? I said, I want to marry her. But, you... Why not? Dad, Mom... You guys won't allow me to marry her? We never said that we wouldn't allow you. But this is just too sudden. Honey... Mom, please take care of Tsukasa. Wait, Masami. Want to use the cushion? Sorry for the trouble. Thank you. Sorry, I didn't really understand... I'll make Japanese tea, okay? - Okay. - Alright. Dad, wait! Don't go! Don't follow me! What are you thinking? Of all people, why must it be someone like that? Is it possible for me to see my grandchildren's faces?! Hey, old fart. Take back your words. Don't call me old fart, you idiot! Then, what should I call you? Should I call you "stupid?" Hey, stupid! What kind of son are you, replying to your parent like that?! That's because you didn't let me call you old fart, so I'm calling you stupid, stupid! Who's stupid, stupid?! What?! Ah, dangerous! I can fall! It's dangerous! I can fall. Fall... Wait... I said, I can fall! So fast. This girl is really not bad. Just take Tsukasa home for today. Okay. This is your fault, Maa-san. You decided by yourself without any compromise. I'm cold. I want to marry Tsukasa-san. This girl, she can't do anything by herself. That's not true! It's true. Even now, she insists to live a life by herself because the helper and I are here, so she can get through it. Tsukasa is getting older now. Her body may have a possibility of getting better or getting worse. So you... might not like her for being like that. If you don't leave her... you're probably going to suffer later. "Maybe, maybe, maybe..." What's that supposed to mean?! Tsukasa! Mom, you are too much! Why do you always think about the bad things?! Even people like me... can be a good wife for Maa-san! I can make tea. Wait... Aren't you burnt? Let me see. Enough, Mom. It's alright. I can make tea by myself. But when there's time, Tsukasa can definitely make it. Mom. Whatever you say, I'll determine my own life. I will live my life my own way. If so, just be patient this year. If after a year, your feelings don't change, we will talk about it again. I don't want to! Try to be patient! This is... Tsukasa's memories since the accident happened until now. The moment when the doctor said that her consciousness wouldn't return. You don't know, right? How I'm living my life all this time? Watch and learn. Wait, why are you giving this to Maa-san at a moment like this? You don't have to watch! Tsukasa. Tsukasa? Until when do you want to sleep? Hey, Tsukasa. Good morning. Good morning. Tsukasa's eyes didn't open at all. What is this? Wearing things like this... This is proof that Tsukasa is still alive. Tsukasa? Tsukasa is still sleeping. Tsukasa-san? Please answer if you understand, okay? Where do you think you are? How old are you? Tsukasa-san? Why do you think you're here now? Tsukasa-san. Tsukasa? How did you get here? Tsukasa? Tsukasa-san? Tsukasa. Tsukasa, how did you get here? Okay, try to use this stuff... and move it like how I told you to. Do you understand? Then, let's get started. Move the pen next to the toothbrush. Move the pen next to the toothbrush. Alright. Tsukasa is fighting now. She's working hard to eat. Come on. Come on, Tsukasa. Just a little more, don't give up. Come on. Hold it right. Come on. One more time, one more time. A little more. Just a little more. Yes, like that. Okay, now, hand towards the mouth. Yes, but unfortunately, it didn't reach. Okay, one more time. Again. Don't give up. Yes, like that, Tsukasa. Great. You're eating properly! Wow, is it delicious? See, you made it, right? If you want to do it, you surely can, right, Tsukasa? Come on, one more time. Again. Do it right. A little bit higher. Just a little bit... You did it, you did it! If you want to, you can, right? It worked well, didn't it? If you yourself want to fight, we can definitely go home. Alright, one more time. Work hard. Stand up, you can do it! Yes, a little more. Yes, a little more. Wow, you're standing! You're standing! You did it, you did it! Then, move your supporting tool forward. Come on, use your energy. A little bit more. Move a little bit more. How was it? The right leg. Let's try to move forward a little bit more. See, you can walk. You're using your left leg. Succeeded one step. Alright, one more time. Once more. Use your right hand's energy to move the cane forward, okay? Keep it steady... Wait... Just a moment. Try to be patient for a moment. Patient. Slowly balance it. Yes, good. Good. Just relax. You can do it. It's okay. Slowly... Yes, like that. How about your right leg, Tsukasa? The right leg... You made it. A little bit more. A little bit more. One more time... You're good. You made it. We can go home! Tsukasa! Look at that... Five steps already. You are doing great. Come on. One more time... The cane on the right side, move it forward. Yes. Right, move it... Try to step. Step. A little bit more... It must be difficult, but that'll be your strength. That will be your strength. See if you can sustain it. You are great, Tsukasa! Wow, you made it! We can go home. Home! Tsukasa! Tsukasa, what are you doing? Where did you want to go? - Go home. - Let's get up. - I wanna go home. - Go home? You'll go home together with me later. I wanna see Mom. I wanna see Mom. Tsukasa, Mom is here. This is me. No! You're not my mom! Tsukasa! I wanna see my mom! Hey! Then, who am I? Who? Go home. No! No! Control yourself! I'm here. Come on, get up! I wanna go back home! You'll go back home with me! Mom... Then, who am I? No! No! Control yourself, Tsukasa! Try to remember! No! Tsukasa, look at me. See... see... Mom. I'm here with you. Look, this is your mom. No, no, don't be like that. Look... I'm your mom, right? Mom? Yes, it's me. Do you remember? Look... It's true, right? I can't stand it anymore. I wanna go home... Yeah, we will go back together. When? Soon. You just have to fight a little bit more. "Love is not a fragrance of a flower. That's what Sullivan said and so, Helen Keller thought..." "Is love like the warmth of the sun?" The electric blanket switch is down there. Oh, okay. Thank you. Your stupid dad gave him a little bit of Sake. Sorry. Did Nagomi understand? That he can't meet Tsukasa anymore? He definitely understands. He understands, but he pretended not to understand. Come on, pass it here. Pass... Yes, shoot! Thank you for the food. Okay. - I'll go first. - Alright. Mom, I'm going to be a father. What? Please tell Dad this too. See you later. Okay. Here. Don't forget to eat it, okay? This is your favorite, so I made it. Mom... I... have it. What is it? Child with Maa... Maa-san's child... Your grandchild will be born. So... Mom, you can be happy again. I can't forgive you. I can't forgive you two for what you have done. Even so, what should I do? I only have to accept it, right? Is there any other way? It's always the parents who are disadvantaged. Seriously... Children growing up by themselves... Don't tell this to anyone. Keep this between us. I need to get back to work. Mother. (The polite form used when talking to parents) Actually... Tsukasa and I are also afraid, but we didn't have any choice. It's true like you said. But we... We don't want to give up. If you can, I want you to always help us. Please. Thank you for this. I got lost. Where's the subway station? I got lost. Where's the subway station? Where is the subway station? Go straight and turn right at the second corner. You will see the subway station. Go straight and turn right at the second corner. You will see the subway station. It's opened now. Hello. Please come in. Want me to make tea? Yes. You can clean up by yourself? Even though I'm handicapped, I don't want to be looked at as a slob. Who said that to you? I don't want my child who's going to be born later, to say that to me. Okay. Please, don't hesitate. Okay. Sorry. Um... Yes. Then... Good-bye. Eh? Wait. Uh, Father... Hello. Masami. Yes. Yes. Oh, really. Whatever the gender, a girl or a boy, when this child is born later, we'll give that child the name "Nagomi." So he can make everyone feel at ease. Yes, we found that name after reading a book given by Dad. So how about Tsukasa-chan's health? Good? Thank goodness, then. Oh, right! Don't forget to call Tsukasa's mom too. Okay. They said they saw it from the book you gave them. Eh? No, I was talking to your dad. Wanna talk? Is it okay? Alright. What did you say? Don't talk like that? Poor him... Yes, I know your feelings, but... Yes, you... Try to look at Tsukasa's condition properly. The baby's body is very soft, so even if treated a little rough, he's gonna be okay. You came at the right time, so she can practice. Auntie. Isn't Toma-chan bigger now? My Masami is the biggest. But Masami, isn't he quiet, but a little nasty? Seiko! Because he was like that growing up. He's someone who didn't know how to talk or even know how to express his love. But strangely, he was very popular and well-treated. Isn't he always like that? Hey, Tsukasa. Has he ever said, "I love you" or "I like you?" Eh? He treated me gently. But... I don't know if it's because he's shy or what. I can't stand guys who can't express their feelings with words. Doesn't that make you lonely? Well, we're married. And I think he must have other reasons why he can't express himself with words. What are you talking about? You've been divorced for three months. That's not your problem, right? It's not that. Because I've failed before, so I can give a little advice. If you say so... Then, how about your uncle? Since we got married, he has never said, "I love you" even once. He always forgets our anniversary each year. He only pays attention to Sake. Right? Because of that, because Uncle is like that, Masami must have followed him. I'm just giving you my advice. Right, about the wedding reception, have you guys discussed it? We talked of doing it before the child is born, but nothing else. Don't be half-way like that. Guys, if we let them be like that, he'll pretend he didn't know about it later. Then, you will think... "Looks like I can't continue the marriage with this kind of person." That's what happened to me. Sorry. You haven't changed. What makes you look so nervous like that? I'm happy to hear you say that. Sorry to make you wait. Hello, I'm Morimoto. Hello. He's my ex-boyfriend. I'm her boyfriend now. I heard from my college that Saki is single, so I have replaced you now. Sorry. It's okay. I'm home. Alas, today's sales were not good. What's wrong? I've been thinking about this matter for a long time. Until Nagomi is born, is it okay if we go back to Mom's house for a while? You don't know what will happen later. What are you looking for? Turn it off. Why? Turn it off! I'm looking for a wallet. I'm looking for a wallet. What's wrong with you? I can do everything by myself. After this child is born... I don't want to rely on anyone. What do you mean? What's the matter with you? - Who's that person? - What? The person who was with you at the restaurant... Who is she? My ex-girlfriend. No, no, it's not like that. Wait, wait. Wait a minute! No, it's not like that! Look at this. See, see this. "Disabled" Apartment. What? "Disabled" Apartment. This apartment. Apartment? I'm thinking of buying it if I continue to work. For now, maybe not, but I want to save money for the deposit. And one more thing... This one too. It's empty on November 2nd. Even though it's not on a good day, but because it's a trial day that day, it may be okay. Meanie. You're mean, Maa-san. I'm happy, but you're mean. You always decide everything on your own. If you keep going on like this, I think... I'll definitely lose my consciousness. Sorry. - Please move. - Sorry, sorry. I'm sorry. - Take everything that fell. - Alright. It's okay, I'll take it. - I'm looking at this. - Yeah, just take a look. I've lost to you. I give lots of advice to others. I didn't even have the courage to step forward on my own. Always blaming others, pretending not to see my own fault... However, I'm starting to get serious now. I've finally realized it. Tonden, the day of victory is near. Don't forget to write a letter when you arrive in Hawaii. I'll definitely reply back. - Okay. - And one more thing. Actually, I wanted to give back the English-listening CD, but Tsukasa seems to be interested. It's okay, I got a new set. Alright. Then, we part here. Okay. Bless you guys. Thanks. Mom. Yes? Thank you. - Congratulations! - Thank you. - Congratulations. - Thank you. Congratulations. Kicking... He's kicking. Nagomi's kicking my belly! God, he's kicking! Feel it. What?! It's true, he's kicking! Kicking... He's kicking! Shizuka! - How is she? - She will give birth soon. Come on! How's her condition? How is she? - Not yet. - Not yet? It's been a long time. Hello. Still isn't born yet. How'd it go? Is he born yet? Yes. You did it! - Born? Already born? - Finally! A girl? A girl? A boy? - A boy. - Congratulations. Congratulations. Congrats! Congratulations. Thank you very much. Thank you, Maa-san. Thank you. Good job. Good job. Thank goodness! Then, just wait for a minute. - Wow, so cute! - Tsukasa. Listen, okay? Don't touch. Listen. Just look first! - Dad. - It's nothing. - What? - It's alright. Really? - Congratulations. - Wow, so cute. He's smiling! No... After all... It should be you first. Eh? Wow... he's cute! He's a healthy baby. You worked hard, Tsukasa. So cute! Wow~ He's very cute. He's smiling! Cute, right? You worked hard. After the moment everyone held Nagomi and celebrated, we returned to the hospital. After sending them away, I made an extra bed next to Tsukasa's bed and laid there. I started to think about Nagomi who had been brought to the baby nursery on the upper floor. Maa-san. Yes? How are you doing? I'm fine, and you? Very, very good. Maa-san. I love you so much. So, so, so much. And... Wo ai ni. And you? Wo ai ni? Wo ai ni, Tsukasa. Maa-san. I'm sleepy. I'll sleep for a while. "One hour later, Tsukasa's condition suddenly changed and she was unconscious." "She got acute liver failure disease during pregnancy." "It had nothing to do with her disability." "One from thousands of pregnant woman may have this rare disease." "10 days later, Tsukasa lost consciousness for the second time. Then, she went to heaven." Hey, Maa-san. Nagomi is strong, but he's also gentle. We will raise him to be a child who can be close to anyone. For sure. February 1, 2014 Double shot. One shot. Five years since that moment, I still think about it until now. Is it because of our encounter that took Tsukasa's life? If we hadn't met, would Tsukasa still be alive now? But later... After a long time... Little by little, I heard a voice say... "If you didn't meet with Tsukasa... Nagomi wouldn't be born into this world." But if I continue to think about it... In the end, will I be able to feel Tsukasa's presence by my side? Eat up. This curry is delicious, isn't it? We can have dinner outside once in a while, but in exchange, you have to help me prepare the bento tomorrow morning, okay? Nagomi, you have to eat when it's meal-time. Hey. Look! Let's eat. Let's eat. Come on. Good boy. The main cause of the fight was because they fought for the same toy. But the one who started it was Nagomi. Kenta didn't want to lose and fought back. Forgive my son. Next is Kitahama. This is the last stop. Kitahama, last stop. Come on. Whatever reason it is, you're the one who started it first. So you have to apologize to Kenta first. I'm going to apologize too. Is it true that you're going to buy me a new toy? Yes. Let's go. Here. Here. Let's go over there. Okay. I'm sorry, my son has... No, I'm also sorry. My son is wrong too. No, I'm sorry. Kenta always talks about Nagomi. Today, he did this with Nagomi or tomorrow, what will he do together with Nagomi... Or he wants the same shoes like Nagomi. Or he wants the same shirt like Nagomi or anything else... Sonomura-san. My basketball friends will have a BBQ party. All have children of the same age. If you don't mind, you could join us. Of course, with Kenta and your wife. I don't have a wife. Oh... She died last year because of an illness. Same with me. It seems so. For the offer earlier, I would like to join. Sure. The event is fun. There will be a lot who will come. Hey, Nagomi! Kenta! What did you do that for? Seriously... What's wrong? You guys were friends just now, right? It's okay. Okay, okay, okay. Enough, you guys. You shouldn't fight anymore. Look, we're spinning. Wow! Seriously! I'm spinning, I'm spinning, I'm spinning. Watch out, watch out. Ow, it hurts. Sorry. Take this, Dad! - Ow! - Take this. Tsukasa. To be honest, I don't know what will happen to us from now on. But we will surely continue to live. Nagomi and I will continue to live. So whatever happens after this... To Tsukasa, forever... I love you. Sorry, can you get a little closer? Sure. Yes, like that. You two match each other. It's like we're in a wedding reception. Seems so. Alright, I'll take the picture.
