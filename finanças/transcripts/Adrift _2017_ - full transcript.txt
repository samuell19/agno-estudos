ADRIFT Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to Porto Santo. We hope you enjoy your stay. Stop crying. Please, stop crying. Come on, baby! Why don't you pick him up? Do you want me to pick him up in a moving car? Where did you read that? What are you doing? Don't you want him to stop crying? Why stop here in the middle of nowhere? Alright... Alright. Daddy's here. Alright. Alright, baby. What's the matter? Are you hungry? Is that all hunger? Let's go and look at the sea. What is it? Alright. Look. Have you seen the sea? It's so pretty. We're going for a ride. You didn't poop. You didn't poop. What is it? You just wanted attention? Did you just want attention? Alright, you're fine now. You're fine now. What is it? It's not fair making me feel this way. It's easy being dad of the year when you're only with him part-time. - Listen, Ana... - No, Jaime! Don't 'listen Ana' me! We probably shouldn't have come. Why are we here with such a tiny baby? They're your friends. We can go back to the airport if you want. It's fine by me. What do you want to do? Today is the first day Of the rest of your life You make it a challenge You face life From beginning to end You drift with no sea A sail or a ship You drink to courage Out of an empty cup Do you remember? Remember what? Nothing, forget it. Come on, man. Just go, don't fuck with me. Just go. It's Laura! So cool! I just realised how much I missed her. - Is that Daniel? - No. It can only be Vasco speeding on a motorbike. I told you that he works in a hotel on the island. I think that Daniel spent the night on a boat. Okay, nice. It's good to know. Why? Do you want to get to know him? Of course. I really want to meet your ex and spend days on a boat with him. A guy who had better things to do than come to our wedding. It's the perfect scenario. I can't even think of anything better as our first holiday since the birth. It's so nice... Knowing that you're still in touch. It's important to stay connected with your teenage roots. It's nice. They didn't invent those shitty social networks that you like for no reason. - Are you done? - Yes, I'm done. Today is the first day Of the rest of your life Will you stop singing that crap? It's Sergio Godinho. Why don't you go by yourself? What do you mean? I'll stay in the island with Henrique. I'll pay for a hotel room and enjoy the view. You'll spend these days alone with your friends and unwind. I've already rented a car. I don't need the boat. Jaime, I'm not in the mood for all this drama and acting out. - Stop it! - I'm serious. It could be good for us. I don't know. It's what I think. It could be something. We have to do something. We can't go on like this. I... I know... Jaime, please. This isn't the time or the place. I want to spend these days with you. That's what makes sense. I'll go with you. Motherhood seems to work for her. What is it, man? What are you going to give me? Nothing. The nerve! You're lucky to have me here. That's your gift. And it's a pretty good one. I like being here with you. You're looking good. Vasquinho! Two things. First, you already said that when you picked me up from the airport. And secondly, we're Facebook friends, so this 'haven't see you in a long time' thing... When did it stop making sense? Around 2003? That was so profound. But you're right. The internet's amazing. You're absolutely right. I know where you are, what part of the world, what country. I can like your pictures in the Amazon. You look beautiful in the jungle. But I must confess something... Meeting in person is a whole different thing. Don't push it, just because it's your birthday, Vasquinho. Will you stop calling me Vasquinho? Do I need to shorten my name just because I'm the youngest? - Yeah, you do. - Don't you dare. - I didn't say anything. - I know your twisted mind. Are you going to call Daniel? There they are! I missed you so much! There's the kid! What's up, kiddo? - Happy Birthday! - Thanks, mate. - How was your trip? - Very peaceful. - The kid's an angel. - Happy Birthday, Vasquinho! - What's up? - Long time, no see! You bet, long time no see! When did you two get married? - Three years ago. - Holy crap! He's not crying. Here, I'm not good with kids. Where's Daniel? I just called him and he didn't answer. He's probably sleeping. He didn't want to go out last night, he said he was too tired from the trip and I think he had some business to take care of. I think! Do you think he's bringing someone? I don't know. Why did you rent a car? You should have taken a cab. It's a little out of it, right? We're taking a boat and you rented... Since Daniel isn't answering his phone, why don't we go and get beer and cigarettes for the weekend? - Fine by me. - What about the suitcases? - We'll take them later. - Yeah, leave them there. We'll go and you stay here, alright? - Fine, go, see you. - Bye. Listen, I know that men aren't good for anything. Hey, keep your eyes on the bike. Alright. See you. Are you okay? Yes, I'm fine. Just work. Alright... Really. It's been a rough year. - It's not easy with the kid. - Listen... I know you haven't spent that much time with us. But you're among friends. It'll be fine. I'm almost sure there used to be a supermarket around here. This way. This isn't about Daniel, right? They dated when they were teenagers. What's the big deal? Okay, he's from one of the wealthiest families in Portugal. He buys companies every week and now he's taking us on his yacht, just because he feels like it. Do you really think someone would be impressed by that? I'm kidding. The look on your face... That's not what I'm worried about. I'm just kidding. - It's him. - Daniel? He says he's on the boat and tells us to wait 30 minutes. To be honest, I still can't believe that you're here. Why wouldn't I be here? We're all adults now, nobody remembers it anymore. No, I don't mean Daniel. I meant that a few years ago you wouldn't even swim in the kids' pool. I'm still not very fond of it, but... This is a little like being on a highway, right? There's no way I'll walk there, but it's fine once inside a car. Are you going to stay on the boat? Of course. Okay, then. Look... I think that's Daniel's boat. How can you tell? Don't you remember our band? Don't you remember what it was called? Come on! This has to be a joke. Come on, Ana. You've got to get in the car if you want to take the highway. Come on, I'll help you. Come on, Ana! Giddy up! Wait... Just a little bit. The hat. Be careful. Geez! He's really well-behaved. Go on, give me your hands. It's alright. Be careful, put your foot here. There you go. Life's going well for Daniel. Hey. This is beautiful. Come on. Look! I might have thought they wouldn't need to get drinks. This is the proof. Did you hear this? Wait. Is that a good idea? He's probably still asleep. He'll get the fright of his life. Wait there. Stay still. Didn't I ask you for 30 minutes? Laura, Ana. This is Margarida. Hi Margarida! What's up? Hi! Margarida, this is... Well, you heard, right? You were paying attention. Could you, I don't know, put some shorts on? Come on, Ana! You sound as if we've never seen each other naked. - Oh, no, no. - No. No, of course not... Vasquinho! Happy Birthday! Give us a hug! You don't turn 30 every day. Don't worry about it, I'll put the beer in the fridge. Vasco... Margarida... Hi! Hi! I hope you don't mind. I told Daniel that it would be awkward but he insisted so much that I came. Of course we don't mind. The more, the merrier. So, have you known each other long? Three weeks. We met at a party, I don't think I've even been home since. That's nice. I warned him it would be weird, but I'm... I'm at a stage where I want to take each day as it comes. I didn't say anything. Here. - Isn't it a little early for this? - Thanks. Early? Why? Any reason is a good reason for drinking in the daytime, right? So, tell me... How long have you known Daniel? I'm decent now. Do you want to go in? - Do you want me to pick him up? - No. You can put the baby here, if you want. Do you have plastic walkie talkies? Yes, we do. I'm sorry, I didn't say hello properly with all this mess. - We never met, did we? - I don't think so. I'm sorry, Ana, I said I'd come to the wedding and I didn't. You know what it's like with meetings and whatnot. Yeah, I know, don't worry about it. He's amazing! Hello! Let's sing Happy Birthday to Vasco. - We'll be there in a minute. - Okay. Look, I'll take this. This way the kid can sing the birthday song too. I had dinner with this guy three times before the wedding. Yeah, don't listen to him. He likes acting like a jerk. And he's very good at it. Jaime, I would really love to be in a good mood this weekend, okay? And am I stopping you? You're not helping. Take care of your son. It's better this way. We'll take the cake and get this over with. Grab some beer. There's a bucket of ice right next to it. Wouldn't you rather call your friend? I think that Vasquinho would prefer it if she was in charge of the party. Come on, baby, don't you worry. Margarida's bikini looks good on you too. Leave it like this. It doesn't need to be in a straight line, right? Can I help? No, we've got it under control. - I'll light it up. - No, it's a one-person job. If this falls, then it'll be more complicated. Let's get the party started. Happy birthday to you! Happy birthday to you! Happy birthday... Vasquinho! Now, please make a speech. You're old enough to do so. - Wait a minute. - You're old enough to speak. First of all, what are you going to get me? He was taking his time... It's my 30th. You've got to get me something. You've got to be kidding me. Seriously, you must be kidding. Do you have any idea how much it costs to put this baby in the sea? And even worse, I'm picking you up from home, in Porto Santo. This is probably the most expensive gift anyone has ever given you. This is a Fnac customer card, right? What do you give when you don't know what to buy? A Fnac customer card. FYI, next time you can give me 50 Euros and say: "Go spend it on whatever you want". Would you rather I gave you a shirt or some socks that you would never wear? - I'm kidding, thanks. - Happy Birthday, Vasquinho. Thanks. The important thing is that you're all here. This goes for you too, Jaime. Thanks! And thanks, Margarida. That bikini's a great gift. Really? Here's your gift, then. I never, ever let you down, Vasquinho. Never! I'm always thinking about my friends, about their gifts. Why don't you try the bikini as well? I'm sure it would look great on you. Laura... Don't be... - I'm not jealous. - Laura? Don't be jealous, come here! Don't be jealous. I'm not jealous. Shut your mouth! Then, what is it? Jealousy isn't the right word for it. - No? Then what is it? - I don't know. Sexism, being a smarty pants, whatever you want. Pick one. What's up, guys? Are we going into the sea? Hey, come on! Baby? Put some lotion on. Put some lotion on, the sun is heating up. I'm waiting for you to put some on me, my love. I like it when you put some on... I'll wait for you. Come on. Come on. I wasn't being serious. When? Just now, when I said that to Margarida. I was kidding. And do you really think I don't know that? But I wasn't kidding when I said that to you. It's true. You're looking good. I like being with you. You're repeating yourself, Vasquinho. I can repeat myself, can't I? It's my birthday and I can do what I want to. Isn't that how the song goes? If it's the song I'm thinking about, I don't think so. I think it says... You can cry if you want to, right? Yeah, that's it. That's right. No, that's not the song I was thinking about. No? What was it, then? Okay, I confess that's the song. I just couldn't remember the lyrics. That's what I thought. You look so nice when you smile. What can I do to make you smile more often? What is it? Is it me, or are you hitting on me? Of course not. That's what I thought. That's all I needed. What if I weren't? If you weren't what, Vasquinho? Kidding. Then, we'd talk. Wait, you just lost me. What do you mean by that? Well, if you like making me smile, and so on, and you want to... be taken seriously, maybe you should start by cutting the stupid jokes, maybe that would be a good starting point. No? This will make anyone nervous. Put out the cigarette. Are you kidding me? No, I'm not. I'm very serious. What are you afraid of? That I'll set fire to the boat? As if there wasn't enough water around. Stop fooling about, a lot of stuff can get ruined because of a cigarette. Wood. Fibre. I don't want black pillows. Put it out. I'll be in the corner. There's nothing there. What is it? Are you kidding me? I've noticed you smoke half throughout this charade. Alright, fine. We don't want Daddy to be mad at you because someone smoked on the boat. This was from the bonus of last year's companies. Daddy was never here. Could you, at least, pretend to have fun? Come on, my love, I'm doing the best I can, believe it or not. Try harder. I know you can do it. So, we're just pretending we're a happy couple, is that it? Isn't that what married people do? Or most of them, anyway? Yeah. What was that in the newspapers about you being investigated? You're reading the paper, now? Nice one, kid. Ana, weren't you afraid of the water? At the beach, you wouldn't even check to see if the water was cold. Yeah, that was me, Vasco. Thanks for reminding me. Ana... Ana... You should get over that fear. Come on, let's go for a swim. I'll come with you. Ana... It's my birthday, man! Let's go for a swim. Vasquinho, come on! Are you serious? Alright, fine, I'm sorry. You seem a little tense, that's all. It's nothing. Ana's fine. You're fine, aren't you, Ana? - Ana's doing great. - That's right, I'm doing great. Guys, I'm just letting you know that we almost don't have any connection, and forget about Wi-Fi. Wasn't that the whole point? Six friends, one ship... into the vast ocean. What's the point of wearing a bikini if there's no one to like it? See, Vasquinho? That bikini's funnier than you. No need to go on about it, I get it. Stop it! - What are you doing? - Margarida... Turn your Facebook and Instagram accounts off. I don't care about that shit, I want music! Vasco, did you hear the lady? I don't know if I understood well, but I think she said something about music. She wants it, she has it. Okay? I want that too. Don't tell me that now all the little buddies are going to remember what they used to listen to when they were young. Happy Couple! Remember the deal we made? No. No? I don't know. We're on a boat with all my friends. We don't have much of a choice. So, we can't really let that part go? We really can't? No? This kid is really talented. I found him. Not in a dumpster, but almost. He didn't use to be like this. He used to be thin with a spotty face. Look at him now, ripped and pumped. Yeah, man! Puberty's fucked up! You've been there too. - I didn't have any spots. - Sing that one... Sing it or play it, although you can only play three notes... Are you okay? I'm allergic to rich smarty pants. I'm sorry, I shouldn't have said this crap. - I should have just thought it. - No, there's no need. He can be a bit... intense. But think that it's only for a weekend and then you'll be back home while Daniel is stuck with being Daniel for the rest of his life. Is that what you're also going to do when the weekend's over? Going back home? I don't know, we'll see. I quite like intense, you know? It's the only way to know how much you're worth. And why are you being nice to me? Why shouldn't I be? Especially because we're the only two that weren't in the band. - We have to stick together. - That's true. It's hot. - Wait a minute. - Dani, can we go for a swim? No, you can't, sweetheart, you can't. We can't stop if we want to get there tomorrow by lunchtime. - Go on! - Be careful, Jaime! It's just a quick swim, sweetheart! - Now, it's really going to happen. - Are you all stupid? Do you think this is a car? You just put on the brakes and that's it! - Calm down. - Let me stop this first. - Wait. - Just calm down. Why should I calm down? This isn't a car! We're here to have fun. We might as well make the most of it. - Have fun. Enjoy your swim. - I'm going! Do you have a float or swim goggles? Downstairs! Leave the float and help me here! Baby! Ana... keep the knife. Defend this boat against the barnacles when we get there. Alright? I'll do my best, captain! No shellfish will enter this boat without my permission. If you were a captain, you'd have helped me to lower the sail, just like you lot. You didn't do anything. This is a riot, Daniel. It's a riot! - It's a riot! - You're crazy. Where's Margarida? - Margarida! - What is it? How's the water? - Great! - Cool! Vasquinho, Vasquinho... Giddy up. Let's go in the water. Let's go and play. Are you really sure you don't want to go for a swim, Ana? I'm very sure I don't want to go for a swim. Actually, as you probably can hear, I'm not the only one on-board. I'll go and check on him. Laurinha, can I ask you something? Go on. But seriously. Seriously? What's up? Do you think that if we hadn't met when I was 13 and you were 18, I would have stood a chance? Do you think that's why I didn't fall for you? Wasn't it? No. It was... I actually liked you. I mean, I didn't like you when you were 13, geez. That would have been too weird. It was later on. When I was almost done with college and you were about to go to college. Sorry, I don't understand. I dropped out of med school because I wanted to travel around the world. If we'd gotten involved, what do you think would have happened? I would have changed plans, right? I'd probably be doing double shifts in a hospital and sleeping 3 hours per night. - What about now? - Now... There's still a lot of the world that I haven't seen, right? There's an endless world out there. There's an endless world out there. But... But... What? I've come to the conclusion that we might not need to see the whole world. Shall we go in the water? With the dolphin. Vasquinho! What's wrong? What's wrong? Are you sleepy? Are you sleepy? You just want to sleep, isn't that right, my love? The kid's really cute. He looks so much like you! It's funny. What? You're holding your son. Your husband's out there. I look at you and still see that 18-year-old that I knew. We talked about this, remember? About what? About having kids. - Daniel... - What? It's impossible not to think about the past when we're all together. It's actually possible. You just need to remember your girlfriend out there. Do you remember what it was like? Yes, I remember. We used to fight all the time and you cheated on me about seven times! I was a kid. You're being a kid right now. Do you know why? It's because of you. You're making me feel like this. Like a kid. Let's go upstairs, Daniel. That's not what I was talking about, and you know it. - No, I don't. - Yes, you do. - No, I don't. - You know perfectly well. - Stop, Daniel! - You know very well. - Stop, Daniel! - You know it. Why do you have goose bumps? There's another reason for us to go upstairs. Stop it! Why? Don't you ever do that again. Don't even think about it, Daniel! - Calm down. I come in peace. - Stop, Daniel. - Don't worry. A swim will do us... - Stop it! Daniel! Stop it! You think you're so funny! Come on! You're okay, aren't you, Ana? She's fine. Are you okay, Ana? Is she okay? She's fine, look at her. Give her some space. She's having a panic attack. Ana, are you okay? Please give her some space. - You're all over her... - She's panicking. - Can you hold her? - I've got her. - Big deal! - Ana? - It's okay. - Help me, Vasco. Help me get this vest on her. - Go away, give her space. - Space for what? You're making such a big deal! It's the other way round, turn it the other way. I'll look for the ladder. - What ladder? - The boat's ladder. Where is it? - It's on the other side. - I'll be right back. Hold this, Margarida. I told you to give her some space. She needs space. Okay, calm down... This way. Let's take her to the ladder. Fuck. Fuck! - Stop it, Ana. - Daniel! Give her some space. I don't see any ladder. What do you mean, you don't see any ladder? - Wait. - It's there. You lowered the ladder, didn't you? Daniel... Daniel! Did you lower the ladder or not? Where's the ladder? Fucking hell, you forgot! - Daniel... - Calm down. We didn't know we were going for a swim. How could I have known? Just calm down for fuck's sake! Are you saying that it's my fault? I'm not saying that it's anyone's fault, but don't blame me. Daniel, Ana was supposed to have stayed on the boat. - Alright! - Ana should have stayed there. We all fucked up, man. Just calm down! Let's all keep calm. It's alright, Ana. It's alright. We'll find a way. I was just playing around. You can do it, Vasco. It's like a game. Just imagine it. Try to gain balance underwater. - You can swim underwater. - Push me up, Daniel. Help, Daniel. - How? - With your hand. - Go again! - This was better. Daniel... - And? - It wasn't enough. - Again. - Try again. Wait a minute. Help me. Wait, wait, not yet. It's a game. You do the counting. One... Two... Three! Damn it! Ana! Are you okay? Ana's feeling better. Keep going, sweetie. Don't you worry. This is one of those situations that seem disturbing, but someday we'll laugh about it, you'll see. Things are never as bad as they seem. I promise. Promise. Are you pretending that we're a happy couple? I'm not that good at pretending. I know you're not. You're a terrible liar. It's one of the things I hate the most about you. I don't know why you try so hard. Henrique's up there by himself. Don't worry about him. He's fine. He's asleep. Don't worry about him. We'll be with him in two minutes. Take it easy. Come here, I need the dolphin. - No. - I'm going to need the dolphin. No, please. I'm begging you, don't take the dolphin away. Please, let me keep it. I'm not a good swimmer like you. Please, let me keep the dolphin. Calm down... Okay? I've got a plan, okay? I'm sorry. I'm sorry, this wasn't exactly the adventurous weekend I'd planned for us. Why did you even invite me? Why? To get to know you better, baby. I don't know. Calm down. It's going to be fine. Okay? It's going to be fine. It's going to be fine. Calm down. Here's your shitty dolphin, okay? Calm down. Calm down. I've got a plan. I'm going to try and climb up. Wait a minute! - Go on, hold on to it! - Laura's lighter than you. - Hold on. Do you have a grip? - Yes. Wait... Wait... No, grab it, for God's sake. Turn it that way. Take it easy. Give it here. Wait. - Wait, it's losing air. - Calm down! - Take it easy, Daniel! - I'm holding on to it. - Let's go! - Wait. No, you're holding my leg! - Hold on. Give it here. - Don't fuck with me! - Daniel, stop it! - Calm down... Fuck, man, I'm sorry! - Hold on to me. Did I hurt you? - Don't worry about it. - You're hurt. I'm sorry! - Just keep trying! - Let's go. Let's go. - Take it easy. - It's losing air. - No, it's not. Come on. Hold me, Vasco. - It's losing air. - I've got you. Come on. Wait. I've got an idea. I've got an idea! It's out of air! Forget it! No! Come on! Come on, Vasco! Vasco, don't lose your strength over it. I've got another idea. Come on! Damn it, Vasco, stay still! I'm sorry... I'm sorry... Vasco! - We're gonna do it. - Go on! - Go on. - Wait! - One... - The wind's up. Let it calm down. Let's wait for the moment when the wind is calmer. Save your energy, so that we can do this. - Breathe... - Go on, we're gonna make it. - It'll work. - Now! Now! Three! Go on and help them. No way, I'm not leaving you. I'm fine, Jaime, really. Help them. No. No, Ana. Hold on to me. You almost did it. You can do it, Vasco. - Let's go. - One... Two... Three! Wait. Go, go. Wait. Go. Harder. Easy... - We did it! - Keep going! - Easy! - Keep going! Go on! Great! No! Crap! Fuck! What's this? - What? - What's this? - What happened? - I felt something. - Calm down. Calm down. - It's just fish. It's alright. You didn't feel anything. Calm down. There might be sharks... There aren't any sharks, calm down. I know there are sharks in the Canary islands! No, there aren't. Damn it! I'll check. Just calm down. - I'll go and check. - No, don't go! - Your nose is bleeding. - No, it's not. - Don't go! - I'm not bleeding anymore. Just calm down, I'll go and check. There can't be any sharks in here, Margarida. There aren't any, here. I know I felt something. Please! I'm not crazy. We're in the sea. There are plenty of fish around. - I'm sure they're not sharks. - It's not a shark, it's fish! It might be. There are sharks here. - Calm down! - I'll check. - Damn it! - Calm down. It's Vasco underwater. It's not a shark. - There is nothing there. - Damn it! I'm tired. Are you okay, baby? I'm tired. How long do you think we've been here? Four hours. This is so stupid... Calm down. You need to calm down. How am I supposed to keep calm, goddamn it? This is stupid. You've got a boat, but you don't know that you're meant to lower the ladder so that people can get back on it. How can that be, you son of a bitch? You grab a girl and throw yourself off the boat without her consent! Calm down? How am I supposed to calm down? I don't even know you lot. Don't you see? I don't even know you lot. You're here among friends, but I don't even know you. What if we die here? We're going to die like this, in such a... Fuck. Why? Why and for what am I to die among total strangers? What have I done? Fuck! Why am I dying like this? No one's dying, Margarida. Shut up! We're together. I promise. No, Vasco. We're not together. We're not together. I shouldn't even be here, you see? I shouldn't be here. I only said yes to stop thinking about Hugo. I was with you so that I wouldn't think about Hugo. And now there's nothing else I can do but think of him. I should call him, apologise, and tell him I'm ready for us to be together but how am I supposed to do that now? And none of you know what I'm talking about, and this is why it's so sad. Dying among strangers is just crap. No one's dying, Margarida. Shut up! Easy for you to say. You've got the vest. I bet your legs aren't getting numb, are they? And do you still feel your arms? I can't feel mine anymore. Why are you the only one entitled to it? Why are you the only one entitled to it? - Hey, don't do that! - Why are you entitled to it? Cut it out! Please, cut it out! Is she more important? She's not, is she? I want the vest! Calm down. I need time. I just want some time. That's what I told him. That I needed time. What time? What time? I told him... I'm not ready, I need time. What time? There is no time left. There is no time... It's such a beautiful day, isn't it? He would love to be here. He's always liked beautiful days like this one. He would love to be here. No. No... No one would like to be here, right? I'm so stupid. No one would like to be here, right? No one'd like to be here. I'm stupid. I'm so stupid! - What was I thinking? - Look at me, Margarida. Look me in the eyes and listen... We're going to survive this, but you've got to save your energy. For crying out loud, you've got to save your energy. We're going to make it! We're going to make it. A boat will eventually show up or something. A boat will... Please, Margarida! You've got to save your energy. A boat... A boat will show up. A boat will show up. A boat will show up. Save your energy. We're going to make it. We're going to survive, I... I just know it, a boat will show up... A boat will show up. Vasco. A boat will show up. Wait... I hear music. Wait! - Can't you hear it? - It's my phone! It's the sound of my phone, I'm sure of it. It's in the pocket of my shirt. Where is it? Be careful. Be careful with the swell. - Let's go. - Be careful. Let's go. - You can do this, Vasco. - Help me! Daniel, do that thing with your hand. - Quickly! - On the count of three. - Let's go. Let's go. - I'll count. One... Two... No... Go on! Again! One more try. Let's go! Fuck. - Hello! - Help! We need help. - I can't hear a thing. - Shut up, for fuck's sake! Shut up, goddamn it! No, this isn't Jaime. Listen... We need help. Hello? - Hello? - Please help us. - Please help us. - Hello? - Fuck! - Let me try. - Let me try. - What for? The phone's all fucked up. Let me give it a try. Fuck, bollocks! Vasco? Vasco! Why didn't you let me give it a try, man? Why didn't you let me give it a try? That was very smart! That was really, really smart. Shut up. Don't you say another word! Why? What are you going to do? - Are you going to do something? - Cut that crap! - Vasco! - Stop! We're here because of you, motherfucker! Do you see anything? What are you looking at? - What's wrong, Jaime? - Just give me a minute. - Talk to me, what's wrong? - Nothing, just give me a minute. It's a cramp. It'll go away, my love. It'll go away. Just stay like this... It's a simple thing... It's a simple thing. Henrique. I bet our son is really hungry, Jaime. What were you staring at? Are you okay? Did you see something? I'm feeling better. I'm feeling much better. I'm fine. I'm not even cold anymore. - I'm fine. - Try to float. Try to float. Try to float, okay? Try to float. Try to float. Vasco. Vasquinho! I need you to calm down. I need you to calm down. How am I supposed to calm down? That motherfucker got us into this mess. What is it? Why waste time now? Let's do whatever we want. What do we want to do? Stay alive? I was thinking... I was thinking about that thing. If you're thinking about that thing, then you believe that we'll make it. And we're going to make it. But we need to stay calm and believe. Margarida, take off your bikini. Margarida, did you hear me? Margarida, come here. Look at me. Look at me. Focus. Baby, take off your bikini. What's the idea? We'll make a line with all our clothes. Take off your shorts too. Margarida, Look at me. Come here. Stay with me. Focus. Okay? Take off your bikini. - The knife! - What knife? When you threw Ana into the sea, she had a knife. Where is it? Vasco's the one with the knife. Vasco! Vasco! Take off your bikini. She's taking it off. Take it off. If we rip up the bathing suits, the line will be bigger. What's going on? The knife! Do you have the knife? What for? We're making a line with our shorts. But do you really think you'll be able to attach it somewhere? - We'll have to. - Good idea. A line. Let's make a line. Give it here. Give it here. I'm putting them all together. Give it here. Easy. Careful. We've already got two pieces. - Don't lose it. - I won't lose it. It's all here. Calm down. - It's all here. - Let me cut it. Cut this one. Be careful... Don't lose it. There's not much of it. Be careful with the clothes. Margarida, give it here. Here's Margarida's. Here. Give me the other one. - Give me the other one. - Calm down. - Calm down, you two. - Here. Give me the clothes. Yeah, hold it. - It's better if we cut it. - I'll make the line. It'll be longer if we cut it. Cut it. Cut this one. Listen... Has anyone checked the hull? The hull? Why do I care about the hull, man? There could be something down there. Hold this. Do you think I know the boat hull? Maybe some shit could help us up. - I don't know what's on the boat. - You don't know your own boat? Of course not. Do you think I changed the oil down there? Pass the goggles. I'll go down there. - Be careful, don't lose them. - Give it here! What is it? You're going now? - All of a sudden you woke up? - Shut the fuck up! Shut up! My son is in there. While you try to climb up, I'll go down there to see if there's anything. Hold this. Fuck! Fuck, man! Stop! Please! I can't believe it! I can't believe it! I can't take it anymore! Calm down. This won't change anything. Did you hear me? This won't change anything! Did you hear me, Daniel? While you try to climb up, I'll go down there to see if there's anything. Fuck it, we're not giving up. - Let's make a line. - We're not giving up. I can't do it alone. I need help to make a line. I need help. - Please help me, Vasco. - I'm going down there for a bit. It'll be fine. I'll just go for a swim and a quick dive. Careful... Three! Again. Stretch it. Stretch it. It's probably heavy due to the water. Then squeeze it. Squeeze it. Let's squeeze it a little. - Put it out there. That's it. - Let's go. Ready? One... Two... Three! - Almost! - We did it. We're gonna make it. Go on, Vasquinho. Harder. Let's do it. Wait. Squeeze it. Stretch it. Stretch it. Stretch it. Get the water out. Ana, press this to get the water out. I'll throw it. I'll throw it. The side with the shorts will probably work better. One... Two... Three! - We did it! - Be careful. Wait. Don't try it. Don't try it. Let Margarida give it a try. Margarida, you do it. - Be careful. - Margarida. - Margarida? - Finally. - Where is she? - Margarida? Margarida? - I'll hold on... - But take it easy. Yes, I know! Let me just check if it's securely attached. Come on. Come on. Come on. Out. Out. Let's go... - Where is she? - Where's Margarida? Let's go. - Where's Margarida? - Fuck, let's go! Let's go! Let go! We've got to get back on-board now. This can't be happening. It's attached. We're getting back. Margarida?! - Where is Jaime? - Margarida! No! Fuck! Fuck! Stop it. - Shut up! - Stop it. It's no use, man. Can you, at least, shut up? Let's look for Jaime. Let's look for Jaime. - Margarida! - Jaime! - I'm going back there. - To do what? Jaime! Jaime? Jaime... Jaime! Jaime! - Jaime! - Calm down, Ana. - What's wrong, Jaime? - He's bleeding. - Jaime, are you okay? - Calm down. Calm down, Ana. Jaime, can you hear me? Jaime, look at me. Please, Ana. Please. Jaime, did you hit your head? If you can hear me, then look me in the eyes. - Jaime? - Jaime. Jaime, talk to me, sweetie. Stay with him for a little bit, Ana. Calm down. It'll be fine, but he needs to recover from the impact. It was just a bump. - Talk to me, sweetie. - Stay with him, but keep calm. It was a horrible impact. A very horrible impact. What's wrong? It's probably a skull fracture. What? How do you know? He's disoriented. One pupil is bigger than the other. We've got to take him to a hospital. How are we going to get out now? Oh my God, how are we going to get out? How can this... Breathe. Breathe. Stop that! Stop it! - I can't take this shit any longer! - Stop it! - Let me go! - Stop it! Stop it! Give me the knife! Stop it! Let me go! - Stop it! - Daniel! Leave me alone! Fuck, leave me alone! - Stop it! - Leave me alone! - Stop! - Shit! Daniel, go! - I told you to stop! - Vasco... Why did you get the knife, man? Why did you get the knife? No! Vasco! The line! The clothes! Bring me the clothes! The clothes, for God's sake, the line of clothes! Vasquinho! Vasquinho, stay with me. Vasquinho... Vasquinho... Don't close your eyes. Stay with me. Talk to me. What did I miss? What you missed? I don't understand. Your trips... All the things you saw. You're going to see them. What I should have seen and didn't. You're going to see so many things. You're going to see so many things, Vasco. Look... When we get out of here... We'll get an atlas, what do you think about that? One of those old, paper atlas. You know... We'll open it on a random page and we'll visit the first country that comes up, what do you think? We'll go on a trip with no stress. Vasco! Let's stay here. It's okay. What are we going to do? I don't know, Jaime. I don't know... Vasco! I'm sorry. I'm sorry. Our son... Our son's all alone. I'm sorry. Margarida... We've got to help Margarida. We've got to help Margarida. Margarida's no longer with us. Margarida's no longer with us, Jaime. Margarida's no longer with us. Son of a bitch... I'm so thirsty. I'm so thirsty. I'll drink it. I'm so thirsty. I'm so thirsty. You're going to kill us all! You're going to kill us all! I can't hear you. - You're going to kill us all! - I can't hear you. Is it worth it? Is it worth it? Is your shitty money worth us all dying? Your shitty boat? Are you going to save us now? You're going to kill us all, Daniel! We're going to die here. Your shitty boat and shitty money. There's no money! There's no money anymore! There's no money! There's no boat! Go away! Go away! Get the fuck away! The boat was sold. The boat... The boat's not mine. The boat's been sold. This was the last weekend, don't you see? The money's all gone. My dad's going to jail on Monday. This was the last weekend. I'm sick and tired of demands. I'm not a bad guy, damn it. I'm not a bad guy. I'm not... Breathe. Breathe. I'm with you, sweetie. I'm right here. I'm right here. Breathe. I'm right here. We're going to be fine. We're going to be fine. I'm so thirsty. I know. I know. So am I. I'm so tired. Henrique's still crying. I can hear him. Can you hear him? Yes. I hear him too. Shit! Shit, I can't... What? Talk to me. What can't you do, sweetie? Tell me. I can't remember... the song. The song that he likes. That one... By Sergio Godinho? - By Sergio Godinho? - Yes. The one you sang to me right at the beginning? We started dating right after, do you remember? The second time we slept together, I had insomnia. Do you remember? That's right... Yes. You held me tight. You pulled me so close. You sang softly. And I felt peaceful. I felt so peaceful. I felt so peaceful for the first time in a very long time. Today is the first day Of the rest of your life Today is the first day Of the rest of your life You pick a choice And you make it a challenge You face life From beginning to end You drift with no sea A sail or a ship You drink to courage Out of an empty cup And an ordinary phrase Comes to mind Today is the first day Of the rest of your life I'm off. - Laura... - I'm off. Where to? I'm swimming. I'm swimming ahead. Keep going strong. Where are you going? - I'm going to get help. - Where are you going? Wait for me here. - Where are you going? - I'm... I'm off. - Don't go. - But I'll get help. - Why now? - No. No. Try to rest. - Don't go, Laura. - I'm going to get help. I must make the most while I still have strength. - Laura, it doesn't make sense. - I'm off. - It doesn't make sense. - It's fine, really. It doesn't make sense. Just rest for a while. - Daniel... - Night has come, you should rest. - Daniel? - Yes? Don't go. Rest for a while. I'll be back. I'll be back with help. It doesn't make sense. Night has come, you should rest. Jaime? Jaime? Jaime? Jaime? Jaime? Please wake up, Jaime! Don't leave me, sweetie. Please don't leave me! Jaime? Jaime! Don't leave me! Calm down... Calm down. He's only resting. Don't touch me! Don't touch me! Jaime, Jaime... No, no... No! Don't touch me! Lay your back here and sleep. Seriously, lay your back here. You'll rest. My...

I've got to get out of here. Calm down. Stop that. Stop! Stop! Don't waste your energy. Night has come. Get some sleep. Don't touch me! Don't touch me! It's all your fault! Your fault! You're the reason why we're here. You're a jerk! You're worthless. You've always been a jerk. Son of a bitch. I lost everything! I lost everything! Daniel? Daniel! Daniel! Daniel? Let me go, seriously. I just want to sleep for a little while. I deserve to sleep. I deserve it. It's my fault. Hold on here. Hold on. It's my... It's my fault... I should have been the first to go.
