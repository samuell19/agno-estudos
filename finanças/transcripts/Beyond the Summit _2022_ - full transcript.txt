"LA SALVAJE" BEACH ALTITUDE: 0 METRES And the boots. I think this is it. Yes, yes... - You can't fit all of this. - Yes, Mom, it'll fit. - Everything is calculated. - He knows. - Just relax. - Sure, relax... - I won't relax until you're back. - Mom... Ok, Teresa, let's go. He'd better get this ready and go to bed. Exactly. He leaves early tomorrow. - Yes. And I can't miss the flight. - Look, Mateo, your mother made you some food. "Some"? Vacuum-sealed, to take with you. They won't let me go through the gates with it. Put what you want in your bag and freeze the rest. For when you get back. I'll miss these meatballs when I'm up there. Maybe, and, please, come down quickly. That's the idea, dear. Up and down. Get out of my house, you pains. I thought you weren't going anymore. Mom... Son... Be careful, son. Ok? Go on, go. BEYOND THE SUMMIT NARCHYANG - NEPAL ALTITUDE: 3142 METRES SHELTER - BASE OF ANNAPURNA ALTITUDE: 3862 METRES What is it, Lurra? Lurra! What is it, Lurra? Huh? What do you see? Jesus... I can't see anything. Spaniard? - Easy, you're safe. - Everything's black. Who are you? It may be a temporary injury. Once the storm's past, I'll call for some help. No, no, no, I'm fine. I'm fine, really. Here we go. - Want some water? - Yes. Here. Thank you. Where are we? We're close to where I found you. At the base of Annapurna. Hello. - Hello. - I have to pee. Are you feeling better than yesterday? Ok, this way. Give me a minute. - Here. - Thank you. Wait. When it stops snowing, I'll call for a hospital transport. I don't need a hospital. I'm fine. I'll be better tomorrow. I'm sure, but I don't need to be playing nurse for a stranger. You're right. I'm Mateo. Lone. "Lone"? Yes, lone, lone. Bergara? Lone, just lone. I see. It has stopped snowing. In a couple of days you will be able to leave. Well, you can get by on your own, right? Come on, Lurra. Come on. Fuck! Come on, outside. - Outside, Lurra! - Lone... Come on, let's go outside. - Come on. - Lone, wait. Go on, outside. Lone, don't leave her outside, Jesus. She'll be fine outside. Sorry, I spilled it. You don't have to leave her outside. - She'll be fine outside. - She's happier inside. Sure, a bunch of yaks are happier inside too. It's not the end of the world. I thought we could have hummus for dinner tonight. I'm going to bed. Lone, lone... Come on, get in bed. Go on. Hello. I didn't know you were sleeping on the floor. Thank you. What are you doing? Making a nice breakfast to thank you. I mean here, on Annapurna. Climbing to the top. So, you fell in a crevasse as soon as you got to base camp and you think you'll get to the top alone, with no oxygen and half blind? I wasn't meant to die here. I owe you one. I have ham. Want some? Have you done an eight-thousander? Yes. Everest, five years ago. South Summit. With the 700 tourists each season. Yep. So, nothing serious. I know who you are. I really respect you, what you've done is incredible. The fastest at climbing the 14 eight-thousands. There are much easier ways to die, if that's what you want. I don't want to die. Then you must be an idiot. I've been training in the Alps in order to ascend quickly. I did several shorter summits around here before the earthquake. I'm not trying to prove anything. But I don't want you to think I'm a fool. And you? What about me? Why are you alone up here mid-winter? Your last ascent was announced months ago. You should be at home celebrating with your people. What are you doing here? To be alone, actually. Or at least try to. I made rice. Aren't you hungry? Good morning. It looks clear today. It's a good time for you to head home. Once I reach the top, I will. Hey, what's your problem? What's your problem? What's my problem? Why do you talk to me like that? What did I do to you? How do I talk to you? Forget it, don't worry. I'm off in two days and you'll be alone. How long have you been here? How long? Three months. Three months. I've spent seven years... on eight-thousanders, I've done all 14. It's over. I've got nothing left. Now I have nothing. Listen, lone... It must be hard to come back to the real world after all you have been through. If you could withstand your climbing partner for six hours as dead weight on K2, you can do anything. How do you know that? My girlfriend told me. Michelle, Michelle Ottel is your girlfriend? That's great. She's the one who relieved the weight. Give her a hug for me. How is she? She died. What happened? A year ago, we had an accident in the Alps. I was with her for hours, but when we reached the shelter, it was too late. I'm sorry. We're both messed up. Thanks. Why do you want to go up now, Mateo? In the spring, with Sherpas, you'd have a chance. We were going to climb here exactly three years ago. Mateo, do you want to die? I want to live. And leave you alone, of course. Come here. Look, do you see the rock wall? There, look. Yes. It's 7300 metres to that point. You should go set up camp and come down to gradually acclimatize. You know, more people die from not acclimatizing correctly than from accidents. Mhm. Hey, what's that up there, ice? - Let's see... - Look. On the right. Yeah, it forms along the rock. It wasn't there a month ago, but the ice actually helps you because you can easily follow the line up. Are you any good on ice? - Yes. - Ok. Let's see how good you are. Who would have thought that someone like me would get you moving? Want to race? Sure. The last one to arrive makes lunch. Aren't you cocky? I'll see you up there! Come on, Mateo! What's wrong? Are you ok? What are you doing? Come on, lone! Come on! Come on, let's go! Jump! Jump, lone! No... No. No! Know what I miss here? Tell me. Music. You miss music? - What are you doing? - Wait. - No, no! Hey, hey! - Stay there. Hang on! - What? - Hang on for a second. You're scaring me. Come. Come here, come. Look what I have here. Here. I have one bar of battery left and one song because I specifically saved it to do hara-kiri while thinking of the Yankee. No... Oh! Before continuing I have to tell you something That's it. Something that happened And hurts with each step Each little step In this life of high steps That is... That long night I spotted you at the end of the street I wanted to run away But love wasn't that shy What is going on? What is going on? It's happening again You were all the way up there At the end of a hill Offering me your hand Holding a white hanky Here. Come on, take it. What? I'm going to sleep. To sleep. To bed. There. It's over. Well? He'll call back. Tea? Yes. Would you prefer brandy? Some whiskey? No. I'll seize the two days. Mateo, you can't acclimatize in 48 hours, much less summit. Understand? Are you coming climbing? No. Lurra, let's go! Lurra? Lurra! Lone, Lurra is hurt! - Easy, Lurra, easy. - Hold her. Lurra, easy. - Ok... - Easy. There, there. There. There, that's it. There you go, there you go. There you go, there you go. - It's ok. - Easy, Lurra. It's ok, Lurra. Tell me you're not still thinking of climbing, Mateo. We'll see how Lurra is doing. You know what happened here 50 million years ago? What about your family? I doubt they're thrilled you're risking your life here. The Indian tectonic plate slowly started approaching the Eurasian one. I won't go up looking for you, Mateo. I don't want to die. And I can't carry you. Everything was still for millions of years. And then suddenly... they collided. How amazing. Don't worry about me nor Lurra. Thank you. What is it? Nothing, nothing. I'll give Lurra some sedatives, you go back to sleep. Open up, open up... Open up. Lurra, no... What did you do? GOING TO TOWN TO GET ANTIBIOTICS. I'LL BE BACK TOMORROW. Lurra, the bandage. Let's see... There. Perfect. Shit... TENT - ANNAPURNA ALTITUDE: 7314 METRES ALARM CLOCK Mateo! Mateo! Mateo! Mateo! Mateo! Mateo! Mateo... Mateo. Mateo. Mateo... Mateo, wake up. Mateo... Mateo... Mateo, wake up. Mateo... Mateo... I finally found you. I've been looking everywhere for you. I summitted. I saw her. I saw her. Lone... Michelle I saw her. I was so tired, I couldn't go any further. Her hands touched my face... I almost couldn't remember her voice... - Mateo... - Michelle... She told me the tent was nearby. She brought me here. She brought me. It's the alarm for the Dexa. You had some early cerebral edema. But you're reacting well. You're going to save me twice. Yes. I've finally made you climb again. You must have really loved her to do something as crazy as this. It was amazing. Yesterday marked one year since she died. I had to do it. We'll get through this. Tomorrow's another day. Let's eat. Look, grilled lamb cutlets. Goshua? Croquettes? - Snails? - Snails. - Snails? - Snails. Stewed ones? Coming right up. An order of snails. The most delicious thing I've eaten above 7000 metres. You didn't make this. - My mother. - Your mother. We have two or three hours of clear weather. Ok? I'm going to call. You've heard him. They can't come. But we need to move. There is not enough oxygen up here. The lower we are, the less risk of edema. We don't want you to collapse, do we? Let's go. How do you feel? Dexa is... the best drug. - Let's go. - I'll take the tent, just in case. - I'm getting warmed up. - Yes. I'm getting warmed up. Mateo! Mateo... Mateo... I want to call home. Of course. +34... 65055... 3566. Hello? Dad, it's me. Mateo! So happy to hear you. How are you, my son? Are you alright? - I'm at 7000 metres. - Teresa, it's Mateo. Mateo... Are you ok, sweetie? Mom... Are you at the top, son? I summitted. You summitted? I did, Mom. I summitted. You would have loved to see it. I thought I wouldn't reach it but Michelle gave me strength. It was incredible. I did it, Mom. I summitted. ANNAPURNA'S SUMMITT ALTITUDE: 8091 METRES But where are you now, son? Son? Son, answer me... Son? Hello, this is lone. Hello, I'm Manoel. What's going on? He needs oxygen. His brain is really suffering from the altitude. Help is coming tomorrow. But he is going to get better, right? I'm doing everything I can. Thank you for helping our son. Thank you so much. I'll put Mateo on. - Mateo? - Mateo... We are very proud of you. We'll wait for you home. You need to hang in there. I love you both. We love you so much, son. Hang in there. What did you say? What? I'm talking to God. And is he answering? Not yet. But he will soon. Tell him to help us out. Do you believe in God? I don't need to believe in God to believe in God right now. Listen... What? If we get out of here, I promise to shave. Before continuing I have to tell you something Something that cries with each step Each little step In this life of high steps Oh, I messed up. Higher and higher I always mess up. Always. That long night I spotted you at the end of the street I wanted to run away But love wasn't that...
