Man: There are thousands of interpretations that have been given throughout the years about the power of being in love. The Ancient Greeks realized that power and made love a god, god Eros. Because of him, wars have been fought. Many lives have been lost. Entire worlds have changed. All because no one could ever conquer his power. We all seem so different at first, but we are so much alike when we fall in love.

( man speaks Greek ) ( explosions ) Reporter: The global community keeps witnessing the crisis in the Middle East, while the civil war in Syria continues for the fifth consecutive year with thousands of citizens abandoning their country. Greece is one of the main transit countries receiving a huge number of illegal immigrants. Unfortunately, policy makers in Europe have not acknowledged the issue and thus do not indicate a willingness to support countries like Greece and Italy, which are now facing the biggest incoming immigration problem. Just in 2016, the immigration wave is expected to rise to 4,000 immigrants arriving every day to entry-point countries as their sole solution. In the absence of a coordinated EU approach, fascism keeps rising all over Europe. Fascist attacks in places where migrants usually gather is one of the many problems, and in many cases the situation gets out of control. ( crowd screaming ) - ( crashing ) - ( women screaming ) ( men shouting ) ( Lumin's "Stojnele' Stokole" playing ) Reporter on tablet: Desperate immigrants are trying to escape, risking their own lives while trying to hide in different parts of the city. From one warzone to another, many of them try to find a way to leave Greece, aiming to reach countries like Canada where their asylum-seeking requests will be approved more easily. ( speaking Arabic ) ( horns honking ) Daphne: Do you speak Greek? Farris: No. ( speaks Greek ) Only a little English. Where are you from? Syria. I'm Christian. Things are very difficult for us right now. I know. In-- in my country things are very difficult also. No. Your country is much more easy. You don't, uh, have a big war between same people. Same family. Civil war. Yes, civil war. Did you study in Syria? Oh, yes. I-- I was in-- at a art school for a year. I... - Drawing. - Drawing! Yes, yes. - ( laughing ) - Drawing. Yes. Thank you. You-- do you study here? Yes, at the university. Politics. Politics no good. Many lies. I agree. Things changed all over the world. Politics, many unhappy people. Politics, many dead people. Yes, that, too. Politics cut people two parts. This is very stupid. Your family? I have to go. Where do you stay? It was nice meeting you, Daphne. Do you take same bus every day? Yes, I do. Maybe... tomorrow if you are there-- - Yes, yes! Yes, yes. - ( laughing ) - I-- I will be there. - Okay. * - You did all this? - Yes. When I see something I like, I want to keep it. Make it more beautiful in my mind. Take one. Any one you like. Here. I'll give you my favorite. This one. ( speaks Greek ) Yes, yes! Eros. You know, the Greek ancient god. Do you know the story about Eros and Soul? Yes, I've read it in Syria. I love that story. Me, too. Farris... how long are you going to stay in Greece? I don't know. I mean, I wish I could stay forever, but... you know, it's a little bit difficult for me here.

This is a non-smoking bar. No, it's not. Of course it is. There is a law prohibiting smoking in food and beverage establishments. Please put out your cigarette. ( speaking Greek ) Thank you. You're welcome. ( gasps ) Shit! Sorry. Do you happen to have an iPad charger by any chance? No, I'm sorry. Thank you. ( laughs ) Hi. Hi. Sorry. I fell asleep. I think it's time for you to go. Right now? Yes. I don't really like sleeping with strangers. Are you sure? Positive. Don't get me wrong, it was great. I just prefer to sleep alone. Huh. Okay. ( clears throat ) - Where are you from? - Sweden. ( speaking Greek ) - It's the climate. - The what? The climate, the climate. You know. You're from the north part of Europe, I'm from the south part of Europe. You are colder people, we are warmer people. You have rain all the time, we have sun all the time. - Are you drunk? - Eh? - You are drunk? - A little bit, yes. I don't think the climate has anything to do with this. Don't take it personally. I don't know you, you don't know me. It was a one-night stand, that's that. Are you in Greece on business? Yes. Are you gonna stay long? A few months. A few months, that's good. ( sighs ) Don't you wanna know my name? Hi. My name is Giorgos. - Elise. - Elise? My pleasure. Elise, I had a great time. And if you want, we can do this again sometime. Maybe. Okay. Do you want me to give you my phone number? - You can give me your phone number-- - Good night. Ah, good night. Right, okay. Ah! And I don't want you to get upset now that I'm leaving, - and you're gonna be all alone. - I'll try. Ah, a sense of humor. That's a very good thing. You see, we already have something in common, you and me. - How about-- - Good night. Okay, good night. Good night. Good night! ( sighs ) ( Sophia Vembo's "Zito Na Se Ksehaso" playing in distance ) ( outside chatter ) ( Gadjo Dilo's "To Minore Tis Avgis" plays ) ( singing in Greek ) No, no, no, no, no, you don't understand. It's a very nice apartment, but there is too much noise. I'd like to be accommodated somewhere else. ( doorbell rings ) - Hello? - Giorgos: Hello? - Who's this? - Hi! It's Giorgos. The guy you had the one-night stand with last night and then you kicked out in the middle of the night? Did you happen to find, by any chance, a small packet of Loseft pills? - You've got to be kidding me. - No, no, no. If you threw them out, don't worry. It was a great excuse for me to come over and ask you to come down for a drink. ( doorbell rings ) What now? Are you coming down for a drink? ( Gadjo Dilo's "Si Mou Harakses Poria" playing ) Antidepressants? Yes. Every night at 11:00 exactly. You don't seem to need them. That means they're doing a good job. Have you ever taken any? No. I never understood why some people take this kind of medication. Maybe because sometimes life is not that easy. Maybe that's a good excuse. Do you sleep well at night? Usually, yes. Okay, then. Imagine yourself in the middle of the night sleeping safe and sound in your room when someone bursts in and grabs you. He throws you down and starts kicking you while yelling that the reality you knew so far no longer exists, everything you worked for in your life is gone, that it's your fault, and that now you have to start from scratch. This is the reality I face every day in my country. Could you handle it? - This intruder... - Mm-hmm. ...how did he get into my house? Did I forget to lock the door? Or did I just leave it open because I couldn't care less? Aren't I somehow responsible? We live in a free world. Everyone is accountable for their fate. You really believe that we live in a free world? Yes, I do. That's very convenient for you to say, considering that two-thirds of the planet are suffering this very moment. Good thing you're taking those pills. I know. Giorgos. Giorgos, time for you to go. My job here is to make your company more productive and more efficient in order to get it to a point where it will be beneficial for my partners to buy out the share you want to sell. No international fund ever risks investing in unhealthy companies such as yours. All of your departments are overstaffed. Mitigation is a given. I need the cooperation of each department's manager in order to begin evaluating their staff. Each manager has a better picture of their employees and how productive and efficient they are. I fully believe in cooperation, but not when personal interests or relationships get in the way. I don't do favors, I don't show sympathy, and I don't work in favor of anyone or anything other than my company's interests. ( no audible dialogue ) ( elevator dings ) ( cell phone beeps ) ( elevator dings ) ( distant siren wailing ) ( speaking Greek ) Ah. ( chuckles ) * ( door opens ) ( door closes ) ( elevator dings ) Hi. Would it be unprofessional if I asked you for a favor regarding a friend of mine? Yes, it would. His name is Odysseas. He's in accounting. And he's a very close friend. ( boots stomping ) ( man shouting indistinctly ) Man on phone: The only thing possible is mitigation. Some departments need to combine, and some others need to be abolished. And I absolutely agree. Then why is there such a long delay? Because it's not as easy as we thought it would be in the beginning. I've managed to reduce the staff by 14% and-- Our goal is 35%. And we will reach that. I guarantee it. Please get back to us with better results A.S.A.P. - Thank you, Elise. - ( clicks ) * ( sighs ) ( Sofia Vembo's "Adika, Adika" playing ) Can I ask you something? Mm-hmm. How come you never ask me about my wife and son? Why should I care about something I can't understand? You wear your wedding ring at the office, pretending you're happily married. You lie to your child, your parents, and everyone else. I only care about things I can comprehend. You don't believe that people may have weaknesses? Of course I do. I just have no respect for weak people. I'm not weak. - ( chuckles ) - Do you think I'm weak? You find it comforting to be like other people and it's easier for you to take a pill in order to handle it. If that's not weak, then what is? So you don't believe that falling in love - can change everything? - No. Did you just say something in Greek so I don't understand? - Yes. - And you won't translate it? Nope. - Weak. - No, I'm not. - Weak. - I'm not. - Yes, you are. Coward. - I'm not. - Big coward. - I'm not. Coward. Pussy. ( squeals ) No! No! No! ( laughing ) No, no, no. English, English. - Say you're sorry. Say you're sorry. - No. ( elevator dings ) ( Billie Holiday's "I'm A Fool To Want You" playing ) ( elevator dings ) * ( doorbell rings ) ( Nat King Cole's "I'm Through With Love" playing ) ( doorbell rings ) ( bell tolling ) ( crowd singing "O! Gliki Mou Ear" ) My father was always absent. We may have lived in the same house, but... it was like he was never there. I always knew there was something missing. I don't want the same for my son. How will I do it? By telling him the truth. Is it that hard? Yes, it is. You're doing to your son exactly what your father did to you. Don't you realize? You don't really care about anybody. You only care about yourself. Your son is just an excuse. ( knocks ) Uh-huh. ( sniffles ) ( door opens ) ( door closes ) Male reporter: The objections regarding the economic politics employed by the European Union against the Southern European countries have risen. Indisputable example is Greece, which, for many, acts as the guinea pig of cruel financial politics that gradually have started to expand to the rest of Europe. Suicide, a previously non-existent phenomenon in Greece, is now reaching sky-high levels. Fear and pressure have immobilized the entire nation due to the inhuman austerity measures. Is this a democracy that has the nation's health as a goal? Is the European Union falling apart? Is this what globalization is all about? Is it possible that things are not exactly how we thought they were? The crisis is now affecting, little by little, even the developed countries, a political plan striking back at the powerful ones who are now unable to handle it. How can people deal with this situation? Is this new global reality going to influence and define our decisions and, generally, human relations? ( thunder crashes ) * ( door opens ) ( door slams ) Man over phone: I understand, and I am very sorry for the loss of the employee, but this has nothing to do with our program, which has to continue as planned. Productivity is still ridiculously low. Payroll to revenue is still much higher than we initially budgeted. Why? Why haven't you shut down the division we discussed last time? Why is it taking so long to reach our final numbers? We just received a revised list from H.R. where there were still names that shouldn't be there. Elise, you should have let these people go by now. We gave you the authority and all the necessary time to do this job. Why hasn't anything changed yet? Elise, are you still capable of doing this job? Man: Excuse me? Excuse me? Can you help, please? Do you speak English? I understand, but not speak good. I have a problem with my back. With what? My-- yes. Bad back. - Bad back. - Ah, back. - Yes. - Okay. Are you German? Yes. German. Hello. Hello. ( speaks Greek ) Thank you. You are-- you are angry. You seem very angry. Yes, I'm very angry. Very angry. All the day here, only this. This, you see? Only this. - Yeah. - Nothing. All the people here cry, cry, very sad. I'm sorry. You are absolutely right. I right, I know. I don't understand a word, but I love your expressions. - Okay. - Sebastian. Maria. - Maria. - Maria. Maria, coffee? No, no, no. Coffee with me? You, me, sit inside, talk. No, no, no, no. Thank you. Go. I go. Okay. Other time? You come again here? Yes, I come every week here. I come, not buy. I come. Okay. Next week? Same day? Same hour? Please come. I would love to see you again. My bus. This my bus. I go. Thank you. Bye. Bye. * I used to come to Greece every year on vacation since 1980 until this year. I decided to move here permanently. I love this city a lot. I haven't learned to speak modern Greek yet, but I am beginning. You understand? No. Yes, yes, a little. I taught at the University in Munchen for many years. This year, I retired. I said, Sebastian, go leave everything behind. Go live in Greece. I am, um... historian. - Historikos. - Ah. I am now a consultant in the research department at the National Library. - You? - You. No you. No you. No me. You, you, you. No, no, no, I am asking only you-- what you do? Ah, you, me, what I do? - Yeah. - I am housewife. Very sorry housewife. - Family? - Yes, family. Married? Married. Children, yes, yes. This is nice. Greek family is very strong thing. Because of the crisis? I am unhappy. - Why? - ( sighs ) My... my life bad. If you don't like it, then why don't you change it? - You are married? - No, I am a bachelor. I was... almost married once. When I was a young man, I was-- I was in love. But... I was too afraid. I love that we say what we feel in our own language. And even if we don't understand the words, it's okay. We know-- we know the feeling. - I go now. - Okay. - Ah. - ( grunts ) For your back. For your back. Thank you. Oh, oh, oh! Yes. Small tomatoes for you. I had nothing to buy here today, but I came to get these for you. I was very anxious to-- you don't understand me now, but I don't mind. - Thank you. - Thank you. - I go. - Next week? - Next week? Same day? Here? - Yes. Okay. Go. Bye. Bye. Ah. No, no, no. This, this. This. Greek product. ( speaks Greek ) Soap. - Okay. - Thank you. - Two. - Two. The truth is Greece could have had the most powerful production of goods. You know Greece has the most fertile soil? Yeah, soil... - "Gea"? - ( speaks Greek ) "Gi," yes. People from all over the world - use words that come from Greek words. - Mm-hmm. ( speaks German ) Geography. Geometry. Geomagnetic. Geophysic. - ( speaks Greek ) - Yes, gi. What a grand impact has your country had on the rest of the world. Maria, have you ever been to the National Library? Me? No. I picked this for you. For me? Thank you. If you like it, next time I will bring you another one. You're German? Sure? Maria, do not confuse German people with German politics. Besides, I like to live where I feel happy, not where I am told to. Maria, I want you to come with me to the National Library. In there you will find your country's history. There is so much I want to share with you. And when you read, you gain knowledge. Knowledge, you know? Me, no gnosi. Me, faith. Faith, yes. So important. And you give me faith. And when we have knowledge also, then-- then we can understand the world around us, you know? We-- we know what makes us happy. Socrates, Plato, Parmenides, Heraclitus, all the ancient philosophers. The history of culture and balance is written by you, the Greeks. I like love stories. I love love stories. Really? Beautiful. From there, please. From there. * Sebastian: All the greatest human passions are in these books. Here. Do you know the story of Eros and Soul? No. This is one of my favorite myths. It's not widely known, but it has so many meanings. Do you know what Eros meant for the ancient Greeks? "Neikos" and "Filotita." "Neikos" in ancient Greek is conflict, dispute. "Filotita" is friendship, union, something sacred, something good. Eros had both. That's why the ancient Greeks made him a god, the god of the whole. According to the myth, Soul was mortal. But she was so beautiful that everyone worshiped her. And Venus, being the goddess of beauty, got jealous of Soul. ( fades ) She commanded her son, Eros... * Sebastian: God Eros did as he was told by his mother. But as soon as he saw Soul, he was so overtaken by her beauty that he accidentally pricked himself with his arrow and fell in love with her. Eros took Soul with him in his palace, spending magical nights together under the condition that she would never look at his face. Soul, however, did not keep her word, and one night, under the oil lamp's light, she peaked at his face while he was sleeping. Soul saw the face of god Eros, and he was even more handsome than she had imagined him to be. She was so moved, she accidentally spilled some oil from the lamp on his shoulder, burning his skin. Eros immediately awoke. And with great pain, he told her that she had betrayed him and that they can no longer be together. God Eros, hurt, abandoned her. And Soul, desolate, made it her life's goal to find again her lost happiness with god Eros, to have a second chance with him. For many years Soul journeyed all over the land in search of god Eros, enduring many hardships, even journeying to Hades in search of her lost love. And god Eros was still in love with Soul, too. So he asked Zeus for help. Zeus was touched by their love story and decided to give them a second chance. After all her hardships, Soul had proven that her love for god Eros was true. Zeus made Soul immortal. And they were married. Together, at last. The happy couple soon enough gave birth to a little girl. They named her Pleasure. Maria, would you like some time to meet outside of the supermarket? You and me, out. - Out? Exo? - Yes. You and me? From here? Yes, yes. I would like to see you outside of here. I am 65 years old. May I ask? I am... 55. And is this enough for you? Sebastian, I... ( speaks Greek ) I'm afraid out. You and me out. I understand, but haven't you missed doing something crazy? Crazy. Yes, I know, I am crazy. No, no, no. Not you crazy. No, no, no. To do something crazy. You know? Something you would not do under normal circumstances. Tell me what is the most crazy thing that you would like to do? - ( crickets chirping ) - ( distant dog barking ) Come, come. Maria, come, come. Don't worry. Don't stress-- Maria, we have all night. I paid the guard. Madame. Your crazy fantasy.

Mm. - Sex. - No, no, no, no, no. This is international word everybody knows. - It still counts. Sex. - No, no, no, no. It's a beautiful word. Beautiful, yes. Me, no memory. Ah. Don't you miss it? Yeah. Maria... may I kiss you? * ( speaks Greek ) ( speaks German ) For you. I know, but this one's not translated yet and I want you to have it. It's a beautiful novel. - "Second... Chance." - Yes. Exactly. That's what the story is about, a second chance. Yes, but it big, big, big. Two years for me to read it. It's okay. I will help. The story is simple. It's a love story about two people... just like us. We do it together, okay? ( speaks Greek ) This is what I would like. I hope. Maria... I know it might sound silly to you, but... I am in love with you. And I no longer have the time I once had. I know it is difficult for you, but... I want to meet you outside of the supermarket. All week long I miss you. ( speaks Greek ) I miss you, too. All the time. ( group singing "O! Gliki Mou Ear" ) What does "ear" mean? Ear. Spring. Ear like Eros? We all have made mistakes. But we all deserve a second chance. Maria, I believe that everything starts from falling in love. No matter how old we are. ( Sophia Vembo's "Poso Lipame" playing ) ( thunder rumbling ) ( TV playing ) ( laughter, chatter ) * Elise: Up to now, I did my job in the belief that something good would be achieved. Things didn't turn out the way I thought they would. I talked to my partners and I asked them to send my replacement. This should not affect our initial deal. What we agreed on must be done, but not by me. We're done.

( fades ) Please do not smoke in the terminal building. * Sebastian: Our first love becomes immortal. It defines us and we always keep it with us. Sometimes fear can give birth to the love of the moment, which is not there to last but to provoke change. The love of transformation. And then there is the love of the second chance. * Because of him, wars have been fought. Many lives have been lost. Entire worlds have changed. All because no one could ever conquer his power. ( no audible dialogue ) Sebastian: We might be worlds apart, but it's impossible to fall apart before falling together, before recognizing something familiar in each other, a universal love. The ancient Greeks understood that power and made love a god. God Eros. *
