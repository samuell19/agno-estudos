Revolutionary Calendar, year 228. After the battle of Slonim, Leila, Akito and the others were stranded in Warsaw, where their experiences deepened their bonds of trust. Meanwhile, riots engulfed Europia as a result of a cunning scheme by Britannia 's military advisor, Julius Kingsley. Akito and the others leave for the Ark to prevent a Britannian invasion. 1,000 kilometers south of Saint Petersburg Euro Britannian Territory Dnieper Upland Course is clear. Holy Order of Michael forward operating base You will be able to reach altitude of 10, 000 meters in one go. A Float System, eh? The homeland isn't to be trifled with, I see. Commencing countdown. Destination coordinates entry complete. Auto-nav system activation confirmed. Hilda, Chloe, give me a final check on the Alexander Variants. - Everything's okay, Boss! - They're working perfectly! T-minus 8 minutes to liftoff! Countdown to liftoff has commenced! All systems nominal! Joe Wise, better safe than sorry. Confirm BRS. It looks fine, Dr. Randle. - Ten. Nine. Eight. - Make sure you come home safely. - Seven. Six. Five. - Let's keep our fingers crossed... - Four. Three. Two. One. - All systems ready! Main engine start! So, that's Apollo's Chariot... It's beautiful. T-minus 30 seconds to fairing separation. 27. 26. 25. Capsule reentry in 10 seconds! Eight! Seven! Over the North Sea I know you're coming... Akito Hyuga. Separation from capsules successful! All units confirmed! All Alexanders show green! Wyvern Squad has detected the Ark! Commencing countdown! 25! 24! 23! 22! 21! High-altitude observation balloon has a lock on Wyvern Squad! Lt. Hyuga has arrived at the Ark! Does this seem strange to you? Continuing to close in! Ark interior scan data received! Capt. Clement! I've analyzed the data, - ...but it's strange. - How so? Its mass is too small in relation to its volume. It's almost as if... It's as if it's hollow. Wyvern Squad is requesting weapons authorization! The Alexanders' power plants have gone to combat output! I was wondering if anyone was home! There's more than I thought. They appear to be engaging the enemy! Engaging who? And how many? Still analyzing data! Master Ashley... Good luck to you. Joannes, I bet you're lonely over there all by yourself. - Master Ashley! - Master Ashley! Why?! Why can 't we go with you?! - We'll go with you! - Master Ashley! Don 't make me repeat myself! I'm going alone! Just you wait... I'll avenge you. Mark my words! This is... Commander! Emergency transmission from Joint HQ! Joint HQ? Who is it from? It's a direct line from Gen. Smilas! Put it on the main screen! Thank goodness you're safe, Gen. Smilas. lam, anyway. But the government and military are no longer functioning. The city of Paris is one big riot. Nevertheless, I will not flee. General, the cause of the riots, the Ark Fleet, is a plot concocted by the Euro-Britannian Army. Can you prove that? A mission is underway to get the Wyvern Squad onto the Ark. We also have confirmation that they are engaging Britannian Knightmares. We must tell the people of Europia what we have learned! Laying out the facts at this point might not help... Leila. People are always looking for an opportunity to vent their frustrations. It 's human nature. But there must still be a chance! If it comes from you, it might work. You should have the words in you that will get through to them. After all, you are the daughter of Bradow Von Breisgau. If there are Knightmares here, it means Britannia is behind this! Ayano! Damn, they're quick to turn tail, ain't they! This thing is a... Those are drones! They must not think much of us! There's a ton of these things! Hey! Do you read me? It's about time. I was getting sick of waiting! I'll blow you away! Die! Akito! Ryo! Die! Die! That's... It's that red Knightmare... I don't believe it! Schrötter Steel armor?! People of Europia, there is something that I must tell you. Please understand how foolish it is to start rioting in response to Britannian media manipulation. We are a unit that fights Euro-Britannia covertly. - We're connected! - Link to all of Europia confirmed! What 's more, our soldiers, the ones fighting on the front lines, United Republic of Europia Paris are the people we call Elevens and keep segregated in internment camps: Japanese. Out of fear of Britannia, we are robbing the Japanese of their freedom. You're not getting away from me! I'll kill you! He's after Akito! Yukiya! Ryo! Cover me! Ayano?! It's all yours, Akito! Britannia 's flying weapon does not exist. After controlling the people of Europia with fear and causing them to riot, they will invade and occupy us militarily. Normal rounds won't work, huh? Let's try these. Die, damn it! Are you kidding me?! You're pissing me off! Oh, no you don't! Why do we hurt one another? Are human beings really that sad? Die... Die! We mustn't be ruled by hatred! Go to hell! Akito! We should have freedom in all respects. Die! However, with freedom comes responsibility. Die! So that we may live like human beings! So that we may make this world a better place! Die! My father, Bradow Von Breisgau, believed that this was the freedom championed by Europia. Die... Die! This is... - It's happening again! - Die! No! Akito! I'm seeing a spike in Akito's brainwave pattern! The neuro-devices are out of control! The BRS has activated? Joe Wise! Record it! Dr. Randle, there's no time! Die! Die! You damn angel of death! Die. Die! You won't take me! Die. Don't do it, Akito! Joannes... You killed Joannes! Kill me, go on! Kill me like you killed Joannes, angel of death! Die. Joannes... Akito... Die. Die! Don 't! Don 't do it, Akito! There 's been enough killing, Akito! If you kill him, it'll be the same as killing yourself! Akito! Akito! Akito, live! Live with us! Now is the time when we must claim true freedom for ourselves! I won't give up. I won't run away. My name is Leila Breisgau. Andlstand with you. That's the daughter of Assemblyman Breisgau? Leila Breisgau! Leila Breisgau! Leila Breisgau! Leila Breisgau! Leila Breisgau! Leila Breisgau! Leila Breisgau! Go ahead, shoot. I'm the one who killed your teammate. It was me. Crap, I'm out of bullets. This just isn't my day. Right, Joannes? For the love of... What a corny plot twist. - Don't poke fun, Yukiya! - Fine, whatever... All Wyvern Squad beacons have vanished! - What in the world happened? - Ark status? It disappeared at the same time! Re-scanning now! Did the Ark explode? Akito... Why? Why have we lost their vitals? Everyone's biometrics, they're... Signals from the Alexander aren't coming back online! It's a bug. It has to be. Olivia! Any luck? No. I can't pick up the guide, either. It's too soon to give up on the wZERO Unit! What is it?! Units with unknown IFF codes have breached security perimeter! - They're heading our way? - Yes. Most likely Britannian... ...Knightmares? Let us go together, Alice. Yes, Mother. He's in an unusual hurry... Get up! The enemy is here! Issue orders! I... I can't... Suck it up! Get on your feet! You still have your duties here to perform. You have a responsibility to protect the lives of the people here. The responsibility that comes with being a commander. So protect them. Report enemy position! Yes, ma'am! Leila... Enemy is to the northeast! Distance, 25km! Closing in at a speed of 140kph! 140kph? Through a forest?! Your thoughts, Capt. Clement? If it's a four-legged Knightmare that can gallop like an animal, it could run at speed on rough terrain. A four-legged Knightmare? Brother... The minefield... Activate the minefield to the southeast. No, activate all defense systems! Use everything we have to halt their approach! They detected us already, eh? They seem smarter than Europia's main force fools. These will be worth crushing. - Enemy speed is not decreasing! - Approaching minefield! Minefield reaction confirmed! Enemy rate of movement is not slowing! It's running faster than the mines can detonate?! Enemy is changing course! It's shifting 12 degrees eastward! Lord Hyuga! You've gone out too far ahead! Lord Hyuga! Jean, support fire. These coordinates. Commencing support fire! Area around front gate hit! System Sigma-3 is down! Defensive wall activation in 90 seconds! Lord Hyuga! Lord Hyuga, are you all right? Lord Hyuga! A wall has sprouted around the castle. Scout it. Right away, Lord Hyuga! The commander of this castle appears to be more formidable than I thought. Defensive wall deployment completion confirmed! We have visuals of enemy Knightmare! You'll have to try harder than that to get over that wall. Remain at highest state of alert. 24-hour standby. Also, keep hailing Wyvern Squad. Roger. Commander, don't you think you should get a little rest? I'm not-- I'll handle things here. This will be your only chance to get any rest. Lt. Col. Warwick... Sara? - You and I will be staying here! - Yes, sir! The rest of you, take a quick break! Go on, Commander. Keep an eye on things here, Lt. Col. Warwick. Lt. Colonel. Do you think Akito and the others will manage to make it back? Come on, those guys would never die that easily. As soon as the Order arrives, we will launch a full-scale assault. Jean, I'll leave command of the operation to you. Yes, Lord! Akito... Are you still alive? Eliza... Akito, he... Akito... Sorry about this, Sara. You and Olivia are the only actual military personnel. It's fine. I've been trained to handle long-duration missions. You have, huh? Still, I'd rather not have this castle turned into a battlefield. Suzaku... Say, Suzaku... It's hot again today, don't you think? Look, Suzaku. Look at the sunflower. Isn't it pretty? Suzaku, isn't it pretty? The Order of Michael's Black, Blue, and White Regiments have arrived. Have all troops take up their assigned positions. Remain on 24-hour combat alert. Tell them not to forget that this is enemy territory. Yes, Lord! Leila Breisgau! Leila Breisgau! United Republic of Europia Paris Leila Breisgau! Leila Breisgau! Leila Breisgau! Let us see Breisgau! Show us our Leila! Soldier, take these flowers! Give these flowers to Leila Breisgau! Please stand by for an emergency broadcast. Élysée Palace, Presidential Office The provisional government has an important message for you, the citizens. Citizens of Europia, there is sad news that I must report to you. The woman who kindled the fires of courage and hope within us all, Leila Breisgau, is dead. Leila Breisgau... ... is dead. Leila Breisgau is dead. We have confirmed reports that Weiswolf Castle Base, where Leila Breisgau was stationed, came under Euro-Britannian attack and was destroyed. Even though Weiswolf Castle is located some 1000km away from our border with Euro-Britannia, our enemy crossed the border and attacked it. I shall continue what Leila Breisgau started. Euro-Britannia killed our Leila, and I will make them pay. For untold years, our ancestors were exploited by royals and nobility. And they righted that injustice by means of the Revolution. Much blood was spilled in the Revolution, and those who spilled it called for still more. They tried to avenge a millennium of grudges by killing royals, killing nobles, killing all they could. But the descendants of the kings and nobles who escaped to the New World have been waiting for the right time to take their revenge! Looks like Gen. Smilas' regime has assumed full control of Europia. The descendants of those fiends will attack us to reclaim the lands they were driven from by the Revolution! The General's cut a deal with Britannia... Do you have proof of that? I sold intel on this place to Britannia. If the General really did care for you, he wouldn't have made me your second in command. You did it to pay for your daughter's medical bills, didn't you? You knew everything, but you left me at large? People can change. They never change! Once scum, always scum! Just hand over the castle and the secret weapon. That's what Euro-Britannia wants. That's the only way you guys are getting out of this alive. If Euro-Britannia gets their hands on the ultra-long range transport, war will spread to every corner of the globe. You risking your neck to fight here isn't gonna change anything. The world's not that nice a place. - I'll-- - Listen! Just worry about saving your life and the lives of the people here! That's more than enough! Nobody could fault you for that! Do not hesitate to lay down your lives in the name of freedom! Even if your life is extinguished, the light of your resolve will shine on! Will you cling to your lives and be slaves?! lam determined to fight! For freedom! Rabble-rousers like him are never the ones who die. They pile up corpses underfoot and use them as a steppingstone to reach the high fruit they're after. My fellow citizens! Rise up! For the tomorrow that Breisgau tried to protect, fight! The General's trying to make himself emperor of Europia. You were just a means to that end. I'm going to set up negotiations with Euro-Britannia. Please draw up a letter of surrender. We would like to see Lord Shaing. If there is an issue, I shall see to it. The Grand Master is now forced to busy himself with Euro-Britannian government affairs. You don't have to tell us that. We're perfectly aware. That is just it. We wish to ask him why we must cross the border to take this castle in the middle of nowhere! If you do not know why, will you be afraid to fight? You dare insult the Three Swordmasters of Michael? Is it not poor form for a knight to draw his sword lightly? Is this what Lord Manfredi taught you? - Why, you little-- - Enough, Scholtz! We won't allow anyone to mock our master, Lord Manfredi! Lord Manfredi is dead. In addition, his will bequeathed the title of Grand Master of the Holy Order of Michael to Lord Shaing. In which case, you are honor-bound as knights to obey Lord Shaing's orders. Prove on the field of battle that the reputation of the Three Swordmasters is not a lie. When will the battle be, then?! I cannot tell you that just yet. But I'm sure that the Three Swordmasters will be ready and waiting when the battle finally comes. Shin... Shin... My most beloved child. Shin! My Shin... I didn't want you to turn out as your father did. Forgive me! Away with you. I thought I told you that a woman like you is no mother of mine. I know, so please protect Akito. By betraying Father? Akito 's father was kind to me. But he was killed by your father. Oh, he was killed... And then I was killed by you... Me, the woman who gave birth to you! Begone, ghost! Shin... My younger brother. Shin Hyuga. Lord Manfredi. Hurry to my side, Shin. I wish to be reunited with you soon. It won't be long. Soon, I can join you, Manfredi. I am also waiting. I may only be your foster mother, but I love you all the same. And I you, Maria. I wish to be reunited with you soon Brother... I miss you, too. It 's so very cold here... Hurry. Please hurry and join us, Brother. If I can... I love you. Lord Hyuga! Please stop that, Lord Hyuga! Ghosts were speaking to me. No, surely there can be no such thing as ghosts. This world is not so wonderful that the dead would cling to it. If it let me be with you, I would follow you into the gates of Hell. Please stand back a bit! Leila, be careful. Don't worry, Anna. Prep the Alexanders so they are ready to be disarmed. As soon as the cease-fire negotiations are over, do it immediately. If you go with the Commander, who will be in charge of Weiswolf Castle if something goes wrong? If it comes to that, you do it, Maj. Hammel. I'm not qualified! I don't think it'll come to that, though. Keep an eye on things. It's gotten colder. I hope this snow doesn't stick. You're the Schwarzwald Mole? Yeah. This is the draft of the Commander's surrender document. Our only condition is that you allow all base personnel to leave unharmed. Where is the base's decryption cypher? It's in there if you want to have it. I assume this also contains data on Apollo's Chariot? Yeah. Since you were our spy, I could arrange for asylum in Euro-Britannia if you wish. True... I might take you up on that. Ancient Roman ruins... You have excellent taste, Lt. Col. Malcal. Do you find my terms acceptable? There is no need to rush. We have time. To think that a girl like you planned the Ghost of Hannibal operations... It's quite a surprise. We Euro-Britannians suffered heavy losses as a result. No, please don't misunderstand. I have no desire for revenge against you. On the contrary, I wish to thank you. Thank me? The foolish Euro-Britannian nobles refuse to let go of that chivalry nonsense that's a relic of the Middle Ages. You struck fear into their hearts. It was most entertaining. Plus, Euro-Britannia fell into my hands even sooner than I had planned. Lord Shaing, this is the second time we have met. I see. You were in that Knightmare in that battle, were you? Lt. Hyuga... Akito called you his bro-- Akito is dead. I have no need for a brother who would disobey his brother's orders. Akito is alive. What do you know about it? Akito promised me that he would return. Akito was very worried about you. He said he wanted to stop you. What of it? Akito will come back. I believe in him. How revolting. When I look at a simpleton like you, it makes me want to vomit. You believe in him? You still do not understand? That you have been betrayed? You're referring to Gen. Smilas? Allow me to edify you. Belief in others is an illusion concocted by the clever to exploit the stupid. Do you honestly feel that humans are worth believing in? If you believe in others, they're sure to reciprocate. That is why you are betrayed and exploited! You need to learn that humanity isn't the least bit worth believing in. With people, it's every man for himself. If you have plenty, to hell with others. No, it goes beyond that. The more miserable others are, the more convinced they are that they themselves are happy. What contemptible creatures they are. That is so sad. What is? You are! Don't move! You're hopeless, I see. Then believe what you will. You will be gone from this world before he returns. Die! What was that?! Lord Hyuga! Are you all right, Lord Hyuga? Yes... What did you do? Lord Shaing, what do you hope to attack using Apollo's Chariot? Pendragon. Pendragon, the capital of Britannia? That's right. You're planning to kill the emperor? If the emperor died now, Britannia will... No, not just Britannia. The resulting chaos would engulf the entire world and huge wars would break out around the planet! That's precisely what I want. I want the world to be buried in corpses. You're insane... I do not accept your surrender. We will conquer that castle and kill everyone in it! Anything I require, I will take by force! Jean. Kill those two. Commander, I'm sorry. Surrender by yourself! Not even a guy like me could do something that shameful. Stand back. Things look dicey down there. Kill them all. But Lord Hyuga, we can still use them if they're alive! - Shoot them dead! - Yes, sir! You don't know when to give up, do you? Lord Hyuga... Take cover! Am I crazy, or was that an explosion shockwave? Yeah, I think it must have been. I'm receiving some kind of transmission! The Alexander beacons are back online? Whose Alexander? Synchronized! Guys! Do you read me? Wyvern Squad here! If you read me, respond! Yukiya! Hey, Sara! Long time, no hear! You 're sounding well. What was that? From overhead, huh? Lord Hyuga? Akito, eh? He's alive... Did you see a flash of light just now? Yes, I'm sure of it. What do you suppose it was? An Alexander! Akito! Akito? It's Akito?! But how?! Why didn't you radio us before now?! Sorry! "To deceive one 's enemies, begin with one 's allies "and all that. - That's mean! - We were worried sick! They're... They're all alive. What a relief! - It sure is, Joe. - Don't cry, Joe! What wonderful news, Leila. I see it, Akito! Brother... Akito! Tell me, why are we trusting that guy? That Ashley guy, I mean. Jealousy is an ugly thing, Ayano. Who 's being jealous of who?! You're an open book, Ayano. If you don 't control your emotions better, you 'll never be able to play the game of love. I never imagined the day would come when I'd hear those words from you! Ayano, it 's time. Let's bail. Yukiya, when we get back, we're gonna have a nice, long chat! Yeah, yeah... We 'll be waiting for you on the ground, Yukiya! Roger that. I'll bail out as planned, so I'll see you later. Yukiya. Don 't keep us waiting. Well, Jean? Isn't it exactly as I said? Oh, crap! It's a Knightmare! Commander! It's the Vercingetorix! Akito! Commander? Akito... Lord Shaing! You've got some nerve, blowing the Ark while I was still on it! Jean! Watch it! Shut your mouth, traitor! I'll kill you myself! Get real! You're the traitor! Who the hell is that? Lt. Col, get to the boat! Hey, wait a damn minute! Pops! Akito sent me! Let's get out of here! Who are you? You haven 't changed one bit since then. You 're still a child. You have no idea how the world works. You're wrong, Brother. Fighting can't change anything. I can't allow the people of the world to go on following the same foolish rulers. Akito, if you are my little brother, you ought to understand what I am trying to do. Brother... Akito! Commander? Don't do it, Akito! You're not like him! Akito, kill that woman! No one can give you orders but me. Kill her! Kill her! Commander. Akito! I'm getting us out of here. Hang on tight. Lt. Col. Warwick! Akito, jump on! Commander, hold on. I'm going to jump.
