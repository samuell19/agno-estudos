Camille, could you tell us what we're looking at? Ashtray... shells... alarm clock... plants... hibiscus... Nothing. Nothing. Nothing. What do you mean, nothing? Camille... What? You don't lick your plate. I thought you could do anything on your birthday. Who told you that? Someone. You can never do all you want to. I was joking. Can't you joke on your birthday? Mummy, do you remember what time I was born? Three-thirty... Right? In an hour... So in an hour, you could say I'll be born. Want some more? It's Serge. Hello! I'll be right there. He's got presents! I'm sorry. An emergency. Happy birthday Camille. How are you? - You all right? - OK. - We didn't expect you. - Did you eat? Just as well. No, but it's okay. Would you like some cake right away? It's very good. You've changed the painting? Do you like it? Yes, it's all right. It's nice, isn't it? Serge, I'm telling you, you missed something very, very special. And what was that? Tell your uncle what you showed us. He showed us his masterpiece. Don't be ironic. It was very good. It wasn't anything. It seemed a little abstract. You finally decided to show your cassettes? One. It's just the beginning. That's great. Can I see them too? Paul, are you there? Camille, your uncle asked you a question. Leave him alone! It's not serious. Did you know I brought you into the world? I was a medical student. We ran like mad. What a panic! And you were there, too, Mummy, when I was born? What a question! Why do you ask me that? Why? Don't you want to answer? Yes, of course I want to answer you. So then, Mummy, were you there? Tell me. Yes. I was lying there... and then they showed me my baby. I showed you the baby. Like this. Above me, like a little flying angel. I couldn't get over it. How? Like this? A real vision! And then I wondered who you looked like. - Who I looked like? - You looked like no one! Everyone thought, I'm sorry, "He's got Serge's face." But you just told me I looked like no one! Camille, what's got into you? He's just agitated, that's all. Are you listening to me? I asked you something. I'm just agitated, that's all. Incredible! The child's not nine yet and he's mocking his father! I'm not mocking. It's more like you're mocking me! Good for you, Camille! It's a conspiracy! Well said. Here's to Camille's good health! This isn't hide-and-seek. Mummy, can we go out for a walk, soon? Yes, that's a good idea. H?l?ne! H?l?ne, come here. Go take him to the garden. And I'll meet you later, okay? Because I've got to talk to Serge. About his new life. It keeps on changing since he left Chantal. Mummy, you promised me. I'll be there. I'll meet you on the Champs de Mars in an hour. In an hour I'll be born. Yes, that's right. - What'll we do when I'm born? - We'll stroll where you like. - Where I want? - Where you like, my love. Camille! Don't you want to photograph me? It's not a photograph. Yes, I know. It moves. I'm being serious. I know. It's strange. Everyone's making fun of me today. Even though it's my birthday. Maybe that's why. I didn't say anything. You're thinking it. You know what I think? I think you don't like me. How can you say something like that! I like you a lot. You won't even photograph me. Don't you think I'm pretty enough? What are you filming? Don't go too far off! Paul, are you there? My god! The time just passed. Where's Camille? There, by the statues. Guess who. That was a good one. What time is it? Six o'clock. Are you angry? I'm sorry my love. I made you wait. Now, I'm all yours. Shall we go? Shall we go? What's come over you? I don't like that, Camille! What's wrong? You tired? Ariane, I want to go back to my home. Of course. We'll go home right now. My home. Why do you say that? You want to get even? I'm sorry I made you wait. It's not very nice on your birthday, but you know Serge. He talks and talks. You must have the wrong child. What's come over you? You're not my mummy. What have you done to him, H?l?ne? This won't do! I don't understand. Everything was fine before you came. That's enough. Let's go back. Are you asleep? Paul! Paul, I've been waiting half an hour for you. I'm sorry Alexandre. I'm running a little late. Why are you screaming like that? Oh, I'm sorry. Did I scare you? I had a nightmare. That's okay. - All right, sweet heart? - Yes, all right. Feeling better? Do you remember that you were a bit ill? I'm dying of hunger. I feel like I haven't eaten in a week. This is impossible. I put it there! It couldn't have just disappeared! It's here, Pierre. Well, what do you know. Thanks. - Are you leaving? - Yes, but not for long. I'll bring you back a present, if you like. What was wrong with you yesterday? You scared us, you know? I don't remember. Why are you leaving so soon? I'd rather stay, but you can't always do what you want to. Sweetheart, rest a bit. You're too nervous lately. And decide about the house. It's been going on for a year! Tell me something. Is that man your husband? What man? That man, "Daddy". He's your daddy, Camille. You mustn't be awake yet. All right. Enough is enough. I've got to go back to my home now. It's long. Too long. She'll get impatient. Who are you talking about? I'm having trouble following you. Mummy. She's very nervous. She goes crazy over nothing. I see. Really! I think it's funny. Yes, very funny. I suppose you'll take me home. Of course. And where is your home? It's pretty far from here. Do you know the address? Do you know where you want to go? Can we go, please? I'd like to go to 18 rue Brochet, please. You said rue Brochet? Could you show me the way? It's near the St Gilles Church. I think it's toward Belleville. We can ask. Rue Brochet, rue Brochet! This is it! It's that way! It's this one, I think. I don't know. See, you were wrong. You've never been here. Your home's not here. It's another one of your ideas. Excuse me, Ma'am, I'll stop and ask. Excuse me, sir... Do you know where's rue Brochet? It's... after the market, you turn... on the second street on your left. This is my street, here. I'll show you my house. Here it is. See, I know where my home is. You see, that's my mother. VIOLIN LESSONS Hello. I'm sorry to bother you. Do you know if anyone's home? No, no one's here right now. Are you a member of the family? No, not exactly, no. I don't feel very well. Could we come in for a moment? My head's spinning. Come in. Sit down. I'll get you some water. I've got asthma. Don't worry, I'll catch my breath. - This'll do you good. - No, no pills. Are you feeling better? Yes, better. What have you come for, exactly? If I'm right, she gives violin lessons? Isabella? That depends when. But you know her? You're friends, probably. Yes. But we haven't seen each other in a long time. I don't want to be indiscreet, and don't feel obliged to answer. In truth, I don't really want to know... All the same, could I ask something? - Sure. - Are you expected? No. It was a surprise. I see. I see, very well. Could we go in? To do what? You're dying to go in there. Or am I wrong? We can't? Of course not, Camille. The lady told us she's not home. She left the keys with me. That's great! We can go in, then. That's my mummy. That's strange. It's like he knows her. Does he know her? No, of course not. Why? It's nothing. Anyway, I don't really want to know. There's nothing to know! I know that, I know. Have you had asthma a long time? It comes and goes. Come and see. Here it is! "Here it is", what? He's behaving strangely. Is he always like this? That's just it, no. All these photos... It's her son. He's everywhere. She lost him two years ago. But, you knew that? That she lost her son? You hadn't heard? Then it's really quite a long time since you've seen her. You had an argument, perhaps? She's not always easy. Actually, I don't really want to know, but... Why do you say that? She often spoke about someone like you. I mean... like you. That's not possible. I told you we lost contact. That's how I understood it. You must be mistaken. Do you live in Paris? In a large house. Hold on! What's all this about? It's nothing. I'm sorry. It must have been someone else. Let's forget it. Are you ill? It's starting again. You should be careful. Have you seen a doctor? Lt'll pass. I'm... l'm feeling better. I'm upsetting you. Why, not at all. What an idea! Isabella always says, "Stop, Laurence, you're upsetting me." In my opinion, that's because I'm discreet. Too discreet, and that can seem the opposite, can't it? You said her son died two years ago? Yes. An accident? Yes again. That upsets you. The poor woman! I think I'd go mad in her place. Isn't that true! It's late. Could we phone for a taxi? There's a station nearby. I'll phone them. Camille, we have to go. This isn't our home. Yes, Mummy. Come on. I'm sleepy. I am too. We're going home. The taxi will be here in five minutes. Leave a note for Isabella. I'll fax her to let her know about your visit. No, I'll do it myself. And come back. It'll do her good, a little distraction. All that, that's a very good idea. Paul, you shouldn't have done that. Who are you talking to, Camille? >From now on, I'm going to call you Ariane. "Ariane", I like "Ariane". What? Why are you saying that? I can't bear that! A child calling his mother by her name. Your husband's right. You need a rest. Yes, and why not? H?l?ne, have you seen Camille? Isn't he in his room? No, that's just it! Madam, a telegram came for you. I put it on your desk. It was Camille who opened it, not me. How did she get my address? I'LL SEE YOU THIS EVENING AT SIX. ISABELLA Madam, he's on the staircase. Hello, my love. Did you sleep well? Yes, quite well. So, are you ready for the big day? You opened a telegram addressed to Mummy. One doesn't do that. I'm sorry, Ariane. Why are you smiling like that? Because you're so nervous. It's normal. Today you're finally going to meet Mummy. You look like two lovebirds. Hello, my beauty. Sorry to just pop in. I forgot my glasses last night. I've got a surprise, Camille. Hello, H?l?ne. Look at this. Could you find my glasses, please? I got you two seats for the circus. That'd be fun, wouldn't it? That sounds good, doesn't it Camille? It sounds real good. It's too bad that we can't go. - I didn't know you were busy. - He's right. We are. - What? - We have to go see a friend. A friend of yours? I could take Camille. No, he's got to come with me. But it's nice of you. Thanks very much. Me, too. Thanks, Serge. Maybe another time. I found them. What's going on? Come here. Was it you who gave that car to Camille? No, I promise, it wasn't. So, who did? Serge, really... All right then! Let's be quite clear! If Camille's fed up with his computer games, cameras or whatever, let him say so! But don't touch my things! Hold on Serge, please. What, it was you? No, but isn't this a little silly? H?l?ne, put this in the chest upstairs, please. What? We're not to play with your old toys, is that it? - You know it's not about that. - What, then? No, I'm just being foolish. Put this back. I'm sorry. Once again, I apologise. He can really be silly, can't he! That was a close one, Ariane! "Ariane", I like "Ariane". Come in. Don't stand there. Ow! You're hurting me. Mummy! See, I'm here! Yes, I see. Why didn't you come sooner? I've been waiting two days. Isn't that right, Ariane? Good evening. Good evening. We received your telegram, and... Here we are. This is my friend Ariane. She helped me find you. Come on! You've surely got a lot to talk about. I'll go play. Camille absolutely wanted to come here. You know we came two days ago? Yes, I know. I've been waiting for you, too. Is that so? So, here we are. Finally. Finally? In your opinion, why did he want so to come? He thinks that he used to live here. I don't know this side of town. But he seems to recognise it all. It's incredible! Was it him who gave you the address? Yes. How could he know the address? He's been like this for two days. You heard that? Heard what? My child called you "Mummy". Would you like to drink something? Whisky? Water? I don't have a lot. No thank you. I don't know what's come over him. Every once in a while he gets sudden impulses. Maybe it's the age. We celebrated his birthday on the 12th. He was nine. But to this extreme... My son would've been nine as well. Yes, he died, two years ago. He was born on the 12th, too. I'm sorry. That's terrible. He drowned. He fell off a barge, just in front of my eyes. We couldn't do anything. I'm sorry. I'm sorry I upset you. It's late. We have to go home. Camille, we're leaving! Paul. Yes, Mummy? The lady has something to tell you. They're waiting for us. My brother expects us. Mummy? Yes, my love? What if we invite Ariane? She can sleep here tonight. She was so nice to me. I'm sure she'd be happy to stay with us. Yes, of course, my love. That's enough now! Camille, we're going. You know you can't leave like that. You're exhausted. There's a couch over there... Don't come near me! Ariane... Ariane. I'd like to be named Ariane. You're beautiful. I'd really like to be you. It'd be easier. And him? Who? Paul. How did he die, exactly? Why talk about it, since he's here? No, he died! How did he die? Drowned. I know. But I want to know exactly. Where was he? On a barge. What barge? A barge. It belonged to a friend. A close friend? You want to know it all? Yes. What was this barge called? It's funny. I forgot it all. But now that I think, it was called Ariane, My friend Georgio renamed it. And now it's called the Santa Rita or something. But he died. Sorry to insist. No, he's back. Thanks to you. You don't have a prayer with this game. And you know it. He was handsome, your little Paul. Bigger than Camille. Mummy! Yes, my love? What about Ariane? Ariane's going to stay with us. Great! Can I sleep in your bed? Yes, my love, you can. You see, you can't leave. You can't hate me. You thought you had a child, but he was mine. You know it's really not my fault this happened to you. I would've preferred to save you all this sorrow. But it's not up to me, you see. I like you a lot! You don't mind me being familiar? No, not at all. Look how well we get on together. I've got an idea. If you want, really want, he can belong to us both. You know... it's been a very long time since I played the violin. Well, tonight I'll play for you. I had a good night's sleep. It's obvious I really needed it. Good morning, Mummy. Good morning, Mummy. Good morning, Paul. I have to go home. I understand. With Camille. Isn't that so, Camille? Yes. I don't know why I slept here. What will I make up? Shall we go? Yes, Ariane. Yes, let's go! Just introduce me as a long-lost friend. What do you think? Yes, that'll be fun. We can't part again, can we? I don't know. Yes, Ariane! Say yes! Lt'll be fun. Yes, it'll be fun. Oh yes. I'm so happy. I'm content. Want some bread and butter? Yes, please. H?l?ne, I must have driven you mad. The time just flew. In the end, we slept at my friend's. We'll have lunch at one-thirty. Make something simple. Ham... carrots, a little salad, and... that bread I like so much. Isabella, this is H?l?ne. Camille, show Isabella the house. I've got some phone calls to make. Come on, Mummy. Here's the living room. Pierre and Ariane have coffee here. The paintings were done by Ariane. Ariane, it's Fran?ois. I'm sorry, but I'm going back to London. We'll have our little party when I get back. Come on, Mummy. This is the dining room. The kitchen's this way. Serge? I've got to talk to you. No, I've got to see you. It's very very urgent. Okay? No, I can't leave here. Call me back. Let's go outside. Now, on the bounce. Want to go for a walk? Camille and Isabella, are you coming? Yes, be right there. Be patient. We mustn't hurt her. What are we waiting for? We've got plenty of time. Look who's here with me, sweetheart. You're making a face! Something wrong, kid? Are you making a face, Camille? We were going to take a walk. At least you can say hello. I'm hurt. Serge, my brother. Isabella, a friend. Sit down, next to me, so we talk a little. Did he sleep well? Yes, last night he slept very well. No nausea? No headaches? Isn't that right? No problems. I'm fine! So, are things going as you like? Are you happy to be on vacation? Anything you want to tell me? I've got nothing to tell you! H?l?ne, are you there? I think Serge is going to eat with us. Very good, Madam. We'll lunch around 1:15. It'll be ready. I told you could work in my studio. It'd be quieter for you. Thank you Madam, but I feel fine here. With all these drafts? Don't worry. I'm fine here. What are you doing? - Funny. You're playing dice. - It helps me. - Do what? - Probability calculations. I see. I know nothing about it. Is she having lunch? Of course. What a question! And tonight will she be staying? - I think so. - And tomorrow? I don't know. Do you want to annoy me? I'm sorry. H?l?ne, I wanted to tell you... You like playing the maid. You're a part of the family. Why won't you eat with us? I prefer not to. It's your right, but it shocks my friends. Is it intentional? If it's disturbing, I can eat with you, but I'm very happy this way. It's a game. You like to play. Well, you're young. Do you play with dolls, too? I allow myself. I like this doll. - Yes, but you shouldn't have! - I'm sorry. These objects aren't toys. I use them for my work. I'll put it back where it belongs. - Excuse me, I was a bit harsh. - It's normal. You're a strange young girl, H?l?ne. That's possible. That's curious. It's been like this for a while. Are you worried? It won't last for long. You said your brother's a psychiatrist. Yes. Is that why you're worried? It's normal. But consider all that's going on with us... I mean, it's not that normal, either. If you let us go things will fall back in place. What? Right, of course. So then, you're sulking? I don't like being asked questions. As you like. Would you rather ask the questions? Ask me then. In your opinion, can you have two mothers? Lmpossible. Impossible, always impossible. Why? Would you want two mothers? No, not at all. What an idea! So, why do you ask the question? Because I heard Ariane... Your mother... She told Mummy that I could... I mean... that I could be the son of two mothers. I think that's strange. You only have one mother, right? Which? That's for me to choose. Absolutely not. You don't choose your mother. And that's it! Of course. I was joking. So, everything's clear? So, who's your mother? Camille, I'm talking to you. I'm going to get angry. We're not leaving until this is settled. My name's Paul. Look, what's going on with you? You want to come with me? Come under the water. It's deep. You'll like it. Come here! They went down the street. She stole him from me! He didn't want to! It's her... Thief! I'll rip her eyes out! I'll kill her! She knows he's mine! I won't let her do it! No one can take him from me! He's mine. What's wrong? You? I thought you'd left. Why would we leave, Ariane? Yes, why... Never leave me again. Promise? Come on, promise. We'll make a pact. I don't want to lose him. You've won. Move in with us. I found him. He was peeing like the "Mankenpiss". Are you all right? You look all pale. No, no, I'm all right. It's my great-grandmother's house. My grandmother's portrait was there. My grandfather was a painter, when I was little his paintings were all over. It was a bit annoying. He died not long ago. In fact, he outlived my parents. He was hardy. My mother called him the Eternal Father. And she's dead? Who? Your grandmother. Yes. She died at 36. All her belongings went into the cellar. The portrait, the paintings, the furniture. In the end, the whole house is in the cellar. That's amusing. So it's all there, beneath us? They say she let herself die of sorrow. A tale of incest. You always have these stories in families. A house like this becomes unliveable. We want to change it all. Because, I didn't tell you, I'm a theatre designer. It's obvious, huh? Maybe it's better that way. Me, I don't have a home, or at least not a real home, I mean. I'm a bit wild. I have nor mother or grandmother. My father took me away. That's how it is. I never really felt I missed a mother. Still... These paintings are strange. Really? What do you think of them? I don't know. They're like pregnant women. It's me who did them. I paint. A little. Have a look. You've done a lot of work! Yes, it'll wind up a bit overwhelming like with my grandfather. No, I didn't say that. They really make you think of pregnant women? That's funny. I went to get my things. Would you like a drink? No, thanks. I don't believe we can separate until this is settled for good. Yes, that's what I think. Sorry I'm late. That's all right. Camille's over there. Just don't lose sight of him. He likes to disappear. Who's that lady? He often talks with people. Okay, I'm off. Now it's me who's late. Sorry. That's all right. Where's Camille? Over there. You know, it's not easy. He just vanishes. I lost him for a while. Yes, I know. - Thanks a lot. - Forget it. Tom Thumb went off, one day. Why? He was fed up. With what? He lived all alone in an empty house. So he decided to take a trip. To do what, to look for what? He was looking for his mummy. He had no mummy? Not really. You change everything. Last time you told the story he had a mummy. Now she's not there. She left? Where to? I don't know. She went to the theatre and didn't come home. Tom Thumb went off. He found a witch. A witch? That's it. That's all? Yes. The End. Camille, do you think I'm a witch? No, not you. Are you sure? Because I love you. Can I kiss you? Yes and no. Let's go to my study. It's calmer there. What weather! I'm fed up. I know. What are they doing? They're talking. Are they talking about us? I'm fed up. I know. You're not being nice to me. You told me something fantastic was going to happen. It will. I don't see anything fantastic. It'll come. You always say that. I know. I'm fed up. Legally, there's no cause for an action. The child is with you, hence there's no kidnapping. I'm more disturbed that this woman has moved into your home. It's not rational. The problem is Camille. He'll follow her. It's as if he's possessed. Yes, but you've got to react. Your son's under an influence. And so are you. What do you think, Serge? It certainly comes at a bad time. If we want to sell the house, someone shouldn't move in. It won't make life any easier for us. You have to ask her to leave and not let this go on. She's not a long-lost friend, whose child died. You don't owe her anything! And if she refuses, you'll have to act. You don't lick your plate. I was thinking that... I thought that the Solomon,,, What's wrong with that painting? It wasn't there before. I don't remember seeing it. Well, no. It was in Mom's room. I brought it down. I think it's good there, don't you? Well, I suppose, yes. What's it called, in fact? The Judgement of Solomon. Ah, right. Maybe it's not the best time to put it there. It's a little too pertinent. Isabella likes it a lot. Is that so? How about a coffee in the living room? So you've decided to stay a while with us? Not for long. What do you want? My son. He's dead. He's here. And you know it. You really do have great powers of persuasion. Don't I? You realise that all this can't go on. Yes, I know. You're mad. So are you. Everyone is in this house. What are you looking for? I don't know. A father for my son. What son? I'm joking. I don't like that kind of joke. Please, Isabella, get out. We're going to the merry-go-round. And Mummy Isabella, is she coming too? She's waiting for us downstairs. Hurry up! How about Mummy? I thought she was downstairs. Call her. She must be in her room. Mummy! Come on, Mummy. Hurry up! Get in, get in. She's coming. I've come to pick you up. Why did they leave without me? The doctor had an urgent call. I know them, urgent calls. An accident. I'm his secretary. What's your name? Martine. What shall we do, Martine? We'll meet them. It's not far. If I understand, I don't have a choice. It's Serge. I just dropped Camille off. Is he there? No, I don't see him. Go look. I'm telling you I just dropped him off. I've got something to tell you. Listen. Isabella had to leave. - I don't believe you anymore! - But she'll come back. Oh yeah, sure! She'd leave without telling me? Mummy would do that? She did it. You're lying! She left, I'm telling you. Liar! I'm through talking to you! You have no right to hit me. You're not my mother. You'll pay for that. Excuse me, Camille. You can blame me for a lot, but that's going too far. Stop, Camille, please! We're here. You're useless! You get on my nerves! Please bring them into the office. Why am I here? You're surprised? It's just a friend's house. You think I'm blind? I'm in the mad house! It's a very special home. No surveillance, no guard. Patients leave when they want to. So I can go? Okay, listen. Sit down. We'll talk a little. You should rest first. You need to learn about yourself. Learn. This is a school for the mad? I just wanted to put you in observation for a while. I decided to help you, to sort yourself out. And if I don't want to learn about myself? That wouldn't be very reasonable. No, of course not. I'm raving mad. You're not very well. I want to leave! I want to go back to my child. I was much too nice to Ariane. Right. But first you'll have to take a few tests, okay? We'll help you untangle all that. You've got to unravel, find the thread. And if I refuse? It wouldn't be wise. But you said the people could leave. That's not your case. For that, you have to be admitted. And as I'm not admitted, I can't leave. You like playing with people? Above all, you like to play. So how'd it go? Very well. And Camille? Where is he? I don't know. In his room, I suppose. - How'd he take it? - Very very badly. I'll go talk to him. He won't answer you. He's gone mute. What'll we do? I don't know. It's absurd. I don't dare speak to my colleagues. You know what I think? She's bewitched us. At least she's there and he's here. I wouldn't mind a pick-me-up. Me either. A whisky? Yes, that'd do us some good. Am I bothering you? Hello, H?l?ne. You look worried. I'm looking for Camille. He's not in his room. He slipped out again? He's not in the house or the garden. What's this? Who tore this painting? Ariane, look at this! - Hello, Martine. - Hello, doctor. Call Isabella Stirner, please. Yes, doctor. Yes, it's Serge. Any news? Is Ariane there? She didn't leave a message? If there's no news about Camille by four, I'll call the police. Say nothing to Ariane. Don't upset her. Are you okay? Hi Pierre. You're getting back when? I'll meet you at the airport. That way we can talk in the car. Okay. See you. So, where is she? She must be out for a walk. We can't find her. You looked in nearby rooms? She was with the woman from number 10. They had tea. Since then, nothing. I don't believe it! We've absolutely got to find her! Well, you really are useless! Why do you always talk that way? I'll talk to you as I like! Get your act together and find her. You lost your diary here? No diary. I must be wrong. Probably so. Have a good look. I've got the time. Anyway, you look for one thing and find something else. Those toys interest you? They look like my son's. He must have left them here. In fact, they're my brother's toys. Well, that changes everything. Camille liked to nick his toys as a joke. He was a funny little boy. You talk about him in the past tense. That's true. That's strange. Isn't it? I have to go. I understand you. Anyway... If I were in your place... What? But I'm not in your place. Go ahead, say it. No. It wouldn't be discreet of me. In any event, I understand you. I've looked everywhere. Nothing. No cassettes. We have to start again. Come on. It's our last chance. You shouldn't worry about Camille. You think he's far off, but perhaps that's when he's closest to you, that he loves you the most. He's very far away. Whatever happens, he's very far away. Everything's so changed. You know, Madam, probability can be inverted. Always. Who's playing the piano? Sit down. You must be Ariane. You're Alexandre, I suppose. That's right. Camille spoke a lot about you. And I thought he invented you. He holds you in great esteem. Perhaps you're unaware, but he designated you as his sole heiress. And, in case of trouble, I should give you these cassettes. You scaring me. Why do you say, "in case of trouble"? Camille never missed any of our meetings. He often spoke of these meetings, but I thought you were imaginary. He'd say, "I'm seeing Alexandre", so I'd say, "Okay, go ahead sweetheart". And he'd go into his room. He'd go out the window. But for two days now, nothing. He must have left. Lately he was always talking about his trip to the beyond. To find Paul. He'd say, "There's a guy following me". And then he'd say, "He's like a ghost". I pointed out that a ghost was just a hallucination, brought on by an unbalanced diet. He didn't want to believe me. He held on to his ghost. That's it. Then he disappeared. I place this treasure in your hands. My mission is accomplished. Goodnight, Madam. Goodnight, Alexandre. I hope I haven't upset you too much. No, I'm all right. Good, then. Where are you going? It's this way. I prefer leaving through the window. We've found the cassettes! What's your name? Camille. I'm not sure it's Camille. I think it's Paul. Why do you call me Paul? My name's Camille. You can be very stubborn, Paul! Come on! Stop. I don't want to play anymore. Come on! H?l?ne, when could that have been? How? I don't know. I never left him alone more than ten minutes. I never lost sight of him. I swear. It's hard to believe you. Come on, get on. I don't want to. I'm scared today. There's no reason to be. Just relax. Come on. Get on. You see, there's nothing to fear. Who's he? This is Yannick. He's the boss on the barge. Hi Paul. Hi. My name's Camille. Really? I thought your name was Paul. Paul, come and look. This is where you fell. Give me the camera. I'll give it back later. I'm leaving. Mummy's waiting for me. But you know I'm your mummy. There's no reason to be afraid. Stop it, Isabella! You see he's terrified. He's shaking. Why are you so afraid, Paul? Enough of this acting! See, it was easy. You just had to get through that. I'm cold. Your clothes will dry in a second. I bet you enjoyed that. Didn't you? Yeah, it was fun. I even thought Yannick was going to drop me. No, he just wanted to remind you how it was when you fell in. Anyway, it was you who wanted to, wasn't it? Okay. We know what happened. Now we have to find him. He's on that barge. Hello, Serge. Did I wake you? Were you asleep? No, me either. I have to see you. I know where Camille is. - So we go? - No, not right away, please. Are you all right? The most frequently visited Internet site was set up by a ten-year-old boy in Brittany. It all fits... We've just learned that the director Mark Rudkin died in a car accident in Marrakech last night. He'd just completed a play, to be performed in Avignon. My God! Mark's dead! That's awful. We'll have to phone Lea. Yes, awful. How old was he? Forty-something. It's horrible to die like that. But you always spoke ill of him. I liked him. When did you last see him? I don't know. A few weeks ago. He seemed really well. He told me I hadn't changed. I thought you two were angry. Not at all! Sometimes he was a little difficult. He didn't like Pierre. Not at all! Isabella, the taxi's here. So long. Don't move! We've only come for Camille. All right. I got it. - Hello, Mummy. - Hello, my child. That hurts! Have a coffee. Don't stand out in the cold. Not for too long. We have to get back home. I've got a meeting with Alexandre. It's very important. All right. Sit down. Isabella, I wanted to tell you... I don't know how. I do. You don't hate me. Right? No. Yes, but it's more complicated. Anyway, it doesn't matter. Camille's changed his mind. He wanted to leave you, but now it's me he's leaving. I was taking him back to you. Really? Between him and me, it didn't work. He must have wanted something else. I don't know, but... it didn't work. I saw his cassettes. What do they show? We could send you to prison. It wouldn't be worse. We're not going to. Thank you. I've got to go. I have a lot to do. I just lost a friend. I'm sorry. A car crash. These kinds of things happen. But your child's back. That's what counts. Yes. Of course. Ariane, I wanted to say something. This really isn't my fault. And you're asking me to believe you? I know it's hard. But at the bottom of all this, he's the one who's responsible. Mummy! 1152: I'm coming, my love. I really love you. I love you a lot. We could have got on very well together. I'm coming, sweetheart. He wanted to sleep here. He's exhausted. Me too. I'm burnt out. I phoned Lea, Mark's wife. But the line's always busy. Put him in his bed, H?l?ne. I'll have another look at the cassettes. - Goodnight, Madam. - Goodnight, H?l?ne. You again? That's right, me again. I'll say this nicely. I don't want to hurt you, but you upset me. Why do you always follow me? Don't you have a mummy? Sometimes I wonder. And... you're not going to believe me. I'd really like to change. Camille, I can't be your mummy. Give me that. Where are you? I don't see you. You're late. Ariane's keeping an eye on me. We've got to be very careful. I'm sure of it now. She's not my mummy. She couldn't be my mummy. Ariane? Pierre, where are you? On the plane. Did everything go all right? Yes, everything went all right. Well, not exactly. What happened? Nothing serious, I hope. Yes, something serious. Mark died. My god! Cancer? Not AIDS? No, an accident. A stupid accident. Poor man. But that's how the worst things happen. As accidents. Stupid accidents. Are you all right? Yes, quite all right. And Camille? He's sleeping. Serge said he was a little nervous? A little. But he's doing better. He needs a father. Like everyone does. That was your father. He's coming tomorrow.
