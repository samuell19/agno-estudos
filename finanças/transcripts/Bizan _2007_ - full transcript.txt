I was 14 years old then. On the night of Awa Odori, I saw my mother crying as she danced. Hello. Thanks for calling. Thanks for you help. Look at the first plan. The targets are couples in their forties and fifties. A tour of the world's heritages plus making ceramics. They reach hotels early... so they have enough time to rest. But they have loans to pay back and school expenses for children. A little too expensive. No more cost-cutting in food with middle-aged tourists. Cut down the air fare? I tried to, but no. No stopover shopping? Squeeze one in the course, and you'll get a kickback. Well, I'll negotiate... Remake the plan with revised costs. Certainly. Sakiko. I found some new entertainment facilities. I see. I'll make reservations. We'll make a new price list tomorrow. Alright. Thanks. I'll be going. Goodbye. Bye. Hello. Sakiko? This is Matsu in Tokushima. Matsu? Why at this time of night? Sakiko. Calm down and listen... Your mom's been hospitalized. What's the matter with her? Don't take it too seriously. The doc said... "Tokushima" Sakiko! Your mom wants to see the Awa Odori festival. It's festival season. Two months to go, but we're already in the festive mood. You used to dance with your mom. It was fun. Although I don't know why. Mt. Bizan welcomes you. "Tokushima Hospital" See you. Thanks. "Tatsuko Kono" Sakiko? Keiko. I thought you'd come tomorrow. Matsu? He returned to his shop. Go there for a drink later. He's waiting for you. I'm telling you it hurts. I told you before. It hurts, so don't do it again. Miss Sakai. You're taking care of sick old men and women like me. I know you're a good nurse. But don't follow the doctors blindly. The patients are watching you. You're young, pretty and bright. You must know that. Hi, Sakiko. Welcome back. Sit down here. Don't stand there. You're in the way. Behave yourself, Mother. Save your lectures now. You're in a hospital, not your shop! So I behave like a patient. Mother! All right. Excuse me. I'm tired. Let me sleep. How about tea? We wanted to tell that nurse about her way of treating us. Tatsuko is great. She really talks like a boss. Let's dry the laundry. She's selfish. This is your mother's stomach. There's a dark shadow in the liver. This is the pancreas. A little dark and vague. This must be the origin. Malignant tumors. The lungs. There are many tumors. They're spreading all over her body. I don't think any operation will be effective. Let's nurse her as we check her physical strength. Are you all right? Will she live? Through this summer. I know a similar patient who survived for a year. But I'm not sure. What'll we do? Shall we let her know? If you have a family to consult with... None. We're alone. The two of us. My father... He's dead. "The little girl was asked..." "Where are you from?" "The girl replied," "I'm from Tokushima, Awa Province." That's all for today. Very nice! Let us hear it again. You're really good. How's your mother? They're still examining her. You must take care of yourself. Thank you. How long will you be here? Business is the stage for women. Don't leave it easily. I know. My disease is merely liver trouble. So don't worry. Aren't you needed back home? I have Keiko here. I'm not so busy at this time of year. I can stay longer. -I have something to tell you, -Say it. I was really shocked. I want to quit. Why? You're doing all right. You're a good nurse. You help me a lot. A patient scolded me. She didn't let me inject her. As if I were hurting her on purpose. You're cold. I'll really quit. Wherever you work... you'll disagree with someone. Be a nice nurse to your patients. All right. I understand. It won't be long before her bed becomes empty. That's the spirit. What did you say? "Her bed becomes empty?" I mean... No, just words. She doesn't mean it. What's that? Are you a doctor? I'm sorry. I want to know what you meant. "Just words?" What did you become a doctor for? Just words? Don't tell lies to your patients. We patients depend on doctors and nurses in the hospital. Many of us are afraid every day of how they treat us. This is the humble request of a dying old woman. Doctor. Nurse. There might be some patients you like or dislike. But we were created equal. So treat us equally... Equally. Please watch over your poor patients. Mother... -Thank you. -I'll come again! They are finished... oh, no! Great! Just like Tatsuko. We were all surprised. She's got guts. Some became her fans because she scolded them. I wish I'd have seen them. Some years ago... A popular singer came to her place. His song was popular. He was with his friends. She tried to make them quiet, but she left them alone. I hit my wife. She looked at me coldly and laughed. Why? It doesn't make sense. What a nuisance! He spoils the mood. We have no liquor for kids. Come on, don't call us kids. I call kids kids. Do you know why he's crying? Who knows? He has good reason to cry. Your song is popular, but don't be so proud. How dare you... Shut up, idiot. How dare you call me that! Let's not drink at such a lousy place. Let's get out. They say it's the best shop here. They're wrong. So is your song, because you don't know people have tears at heart. Don't talk like a preacher! -Matsu, bring salt. -Alright. Just get out! "Conference with the teacher" That was his only hit song. He became an actor, but it wasn't an easy job. At the Awa Odori festival four years later, he visited her with a bouquet. Who is he? Saburo Yoshino. He comes every year. Saburo Yoshino? I know him. If Tatsuko gets well, let's go to the festival all together. Why don't we dance? My muscles would ache. Something wrong? Miss Kono. Miss Kono. I'm sorry. Doctor, don't bow to me. You scolded me. I'm ashamed of what I said. Please forgive me. I was worried and defeated. Scared, too. I didn't know what to say to you. I was afraid you might want to change hospitals. My name is Daisuke Terasawa. I'm a pediatrician. I'm Sakiko Kono. That young doctor... came to me in the ward and said, "I'm ashamed of myself for what I said." "Thank you for scolding me." Some character! I felt he got me. I was surprised. But on closer view, he's handsome. Don't you think so, Sakiko? Are you turning 34? What? "Miracle on 34th Street." Yes! Sorry. I'm 32. You got a lover? No. I'm not interested in marriage. You won't be able to see your grandchild. Devils will laugh if you talk about the future. You've gotten well. You'll be able to play soccer again. Really? So try hard. I will. No more medicines. Alright. Come here. Dr. Terasawa. -Chief Obata wants you. -Thanks. Excuse me. Good morning. Here's your lunch. Eat it. Oh, thank you. A chicken bowl again. What? By the way, I hear you offended Tatsuko. Tatsuko? Yeah. Did you apologize? Yes. If she got angry with you, it was certainly your fault. -Regret it. -Yeah. That's all right. It's like a routine. She was like that to me before. I want her to take a private room. But she hates it. "All the patients are equal," she says. Oh, it looks delicious. Eat it. -Terasawa. -Yeah? She's joined the Dream Grass Society. -Pass. -Here! So do l! Last card! Great! -Pass. -You pass? I won! I'm a millionaire. I am the second one! See! Tell me the truth. Why don't we have... a picture of my father? You said he died long ago and you lost his pictures. Tell me the truth. As a matter of fact, I didn't marry your father. And he had another home elsewhere. But, Sakiko... it's not something sad or regretful. I loved your father very much. And you're the child of the man I really loved. Then, why did you lie to me? You were ashamed. You did a bad thing. Sakiko! He's dead. Your father is gone. I want to see him. I want to see him. I want to see him. Let me check your blood sugar level. Miss Kono. Help me. Guess who? I win! Wait! I came here before I left Tokushima. It was a long time ago. I loved the view of the sea here. It told me the world was spreading far and wide. So you became a travel agent? Maybe so. When I came home from school one day, my mother was wearing makeup. She said "hello" over her shoulder. I didn't want to see it again, so I came home late. When she was out, I felt relieved. What a bad daughter I was! After autumn... she won't live. Did you tell her that? Maybe that's what she wants. But I don't know... how to tell her...what to say. Have you ever heard of the Dream Grass Society? No. About self-dedication? Self-dedication? To leave a body to science. One agrees to dedicate one's body to the university after one dies. The Dream Grass Society supports the system. Tatsuko... Your mother wants to do that. What would happen to her body? Medical students would dissect it. Dissect? Her family can refuse it. Tatsuko needs her daughter's agreement to her dedication. I think she did it all by herself. There are many delicate problems. It takes one to three years for the body to return to its family. It's not a short time for the bereaved family. What's this "message sheet?" A kind of letter from the dedicator to the students. She can write anything. Anything? Yes. Cheering words, a poem, a story of her dog, anything. The students will read it first, then will dissect her body. Tatsuko, see you tomorrow. Thank you, and take care. Good bye. Tatsuko entrusted me with this. She called me about this time last year. She wanted me to give it to you. Why didn't she call me? She wanted me... to give it to you after she dies. I'm back. I'm soaking. Hello. She told me to keep it a secret until she dies. I don't know what it is. But... I thought I should give it to you earlier than that. Kojiro Shinozaki. "Kojiro Shinozaki" Tokyo. My birthday. "To Tatsuko" K.S. Kojiro Shinozaki. "Bizan, June 15, 197 1" The year before I was born. Father! "Who are your parents?" "What are their names?" "My father is Jurobei of Awa." "My mother is Oyumi." Oyumi was surprised. Puppet Joruri. You're right. She should go out of the hospital for exercise once in a while. Thank you. She's tough, so she doesn't show the pain on her face. But, actually, it must be painful. Take care of her. "She remembered the mole on her forehead." "Oh, you are my daughter!" "She was about to say that." "But she stopped..." I'm sorry. I can't eat it all. Will you eat it? Why the sour look? Mother. Tell me the truth. My father is alive, isn't he? Why did you say he was dead? "She could not call her her daughter." "The mother took the high road and the child took the low..." Mother! "the low road." We're even. You lied to me, didn't you? When Dr. Shimada told you I'd die? So we're even. Cut it out. You don't need me? You closed the shop without telling me. You didn't tell me when you got hospitalized. You make decisions alone. It's on me. I enjoyed it. I want it too! Give it to me! Right. I said cruel things to my mother. When I'm with her, I feel... as if I were alone in the world. So l... You told her how you felt? I regret it... But I couldn't tell her any other way. It was better than telling her nothing. I think so. She must have a hard time for being unable to tell you about your father. But she had some reasons. Only she knew. No one but your mother. No one else knew. Not even you, her daughter. May be. She's lonely. A very lonely person. Good morning. Good morning... This is your book. Thank you. Mother. I'll return to Tokyo. I have work to do. You will? That's better. Business is the stage for women, right? Work hard. Sakiko. Good morning. Are you leaving? So suddenly? Is somebody nice waiting? Change your towels. Thank you very much. You're welcome. I'll take care of your mother. Tokyo isn't very far. I'll call you if something happens. Thanks. I'll call you even nothing happens. Thanks. The next station is arriving. Tatsuko! I'm a terrible mother. I've worried my daughter for a long time because of vanity. When she glared at me the other day, I was scared. She told me that she said a terrible thing to you. She did. She's stubborn. She doesn't change her opinions easily. But, in fact, she's simple and obedient. I'm glad she doesn't resemble me on that point. "Dear Tatsuko," "I'm writing this letter as soon as we parted." "I'm glad we met today." "l usually walk the path to the shrine," "but when you were with me..." "it looked different." "You walked up the steps." "What did you pray for at the shrine?" "I'm looking forward to seeing you soon." "I'll call you." "My signal will ring twice." K.S. "Time flies when we're together." "l miss you so much. I'm dying to see you." "Tomorrow, come quickly." Please release the shutter. "lt was a pleasant trip." "I'll send you the photo." "l wish I could hand it to you." "There's only one photo of us together." "l can't forget Mt. Bizan when we saw it together." "How did you like my home?" "I'm sorry I can't go." "l have no time to spare." "How are you?" "l want to hear your voice..." "5-32, Hongou" "5-32, Hongou, Tokyo" "Shinozaki's Clinic" Self-dedication? To leave a body to science. One dedicates one's body to the university after one dies. Students need bodies to dissect to become doctors. Your mother understands the surgery so deeply. Consultation? Your first visit? Let me make your card. Fill out this paper please. Your health insurance card. Yeah, again. -See you next week. -Thank you. Take the medicine regularly. Don't stop it midway. It bothers me. I'll take it. Thank you, doctor. Are you all sick? Our knees hurt together, because we're good friends. So you'll get cured together. Then, must I cure just one lady? That'll be me. Will you wait a little longer? Next patient, please. What is it? It's my throat. It aches. No previous illness. Allergies? "Name: Sakiko Kono" Is your name Kono? Yes. Where you from? Tokushima. "Date of birth: May 9, 1972" I took the old lady to the bus stop. Really? Your family? I have a mother. She's not well. Fortunately, she has a good doctor. Your throat seems all right. No medicine is needed. Don't cool yourself too much. The festival season is coming. In Tokushima. I haven't seen the dances for thirty years. If you have time, please come to see them. "Are you on Yumeko Bridge now?" "I'm writing this letter in Tokyo." "l wanted to marry you..." "even at the cost of all I have now." "But I can't even realize your wish..." "to see Awa Odori together." "Tatsuko..." "I'm sorry." "But I can't leave this small clinic..." "or turn down my devoted wife." "l can't betray her trust." How's her? In the lCU on the third floor. This way. Mother. Stupid. You didn't have to come.
