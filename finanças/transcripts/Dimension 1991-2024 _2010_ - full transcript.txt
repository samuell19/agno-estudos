The pork roast is gone. - Hi Jane. - Hi. - Can we have a word with you? - Go away. I don't like either of you, and the only reason I'm talking to you is cause you're friends of Eddie. We used to be, he cheated us. Of course he did, three times actually. Three times! - Well, yeah, expenses. - Three times. As long as no one found out, there was no harm done. Well, last time they found out and it's giving us hill. Gotta find the real stuff, you know what's supposed to be inside that parcel? I've no idea. He must've sold it. Not this time. Sat in front of that parcel for three days. Said it wasn't for sale. I used to live a decent lfie. I'm tired to be shot at. It's very kind of Jane to help us. Oh, this has nothing to do with it. Why don't you open the parcel? Find out what was there. Sometimes it's better not to look. Where do you think it went to? Abroad, of course. Maybe his family took it. Or the man that bought his horse. And where did the family go? I don't know. And the horse? Sweden. You didn't talk to anybody else about this, did you? Bitch. Is that him? Go and talk to him. You two are in big trouble, especially you. Do you remember me? Have you come to give me my money back? You have a shit bruise. This horse has never won anything in its life. I've come to ask you what you've done with the parcel that Eddie gave to you. What parcel? The parcel that Eddie gave you to bring back or whatever, I don't know. I have no idea what you're talking about. And don't say hello to Eddie from me! Don't worry, he's dead. Good. Well? Well what? - Did he talk? - No. Where is he going now? Home? No. He's going to his office, he won't be home until five o'clock. Can I go now? Thought so. Can we see that it's opening? There, thanks. Thanks, thanks.
