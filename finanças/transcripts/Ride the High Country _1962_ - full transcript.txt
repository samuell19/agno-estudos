[SHOUTING] [BELLY DANCING MUSIC PLAYING] [CROWD CHEERING] Come on, kids! Out of the street. Come on, kids. Get back there. Hey, you! Get out of there! POLICEMAN: Stay out of the street! Out of the street! Get out of the street! Clear the street! Get away from there! Watch out! Get out of the way, old man. Can't you hear? Can't you see you're in the way? All right! Out of the way! [CROWD CHEERING] [CARNIVAL MUSIC PLAYING] [CAR HORN BEEPS] Watch out, old-timer! You got a good horse there, cowboy, but not good enough. I'll have that dollar. I'm figuring these races smell pretty bad. That thing never loses, and it's been running since breakfast. You had your chance. Let's say I'm a poor loser, so if you want this dollar, come right on over here and get it, Sonny boy. [BELLY DANCING MUSIC PLAYING] BARKER: Right this way, folks! Come one, come all. Step right up and try your luck. Everybody welcome. See the Oregon kid in person. Right this way, folks! Come one, come all. Step right up and outshoot the famous Oregon kid, the last of the Western town tamers. Fatten your wallets and be a hero to your family. Everybody welcome. Step up. Try your luck. All you gotta do is hit the plate, and you win the money. Quit the sermon and turn her loose. $1.00 on the yellow. Shooting against you is like sneaking licorice whips from a baby girl. Care to try again? Uh, mister, could I make a 10-cent bet? A whole dime? You're a plunger, sir. Well, you see, I ain't sure I could hit a moving target without buckshot. I used to be fair to middlin' with a scatter gun, but that was when the bird wasn't too far away or flying too fast. With them plates, I just don't see how you manage. Well, I'll be damned. How are you, Gil? No great complaints. How long has it been? Glory, I'd hate to say. Quite some time. Where you been all these years? Oh, here and there. Quite a little enterprise you got. Well, Steve, it's easier than punching cows, and it pays off with free drinks every time I walk into a saloon. Would it surprise you to know the Oregon kid is the envy of every small-minded ribbon clerk and shirttailed towhead from here to Pocatello? Well, why not? All these single-handed exploits. Tell me, Gil, who was the Omaha gang? I don't seem to recollect them fellers. Flagstaff, Monterey, Hondo-- I remember we worked them places. Dodge city and Wichita? Did you ever run with the Earp boys, Gil? You gotta allow for a little exaggeration. That's part of playing this game. It's not much of a game. A blind man couldn't miss using buckshot. Must be something important to bring you here. Looks like you've been riding a long time but not getting far. Job. You mean you're still at it-- federal marshal? No. I'm working for the bank. You, a bank guard? I'm transporting gold from the mining camp up there to the bank down here. Gold bullion. $250,000 worth, the way the letter put it. A quarter of a million. And I could use some help. Can you recommend anyone? I'll give it some thought. You do that, will you? And let me know. I will, Steve. I surely will. Well, what do you figure we're going to do? Drink champagne, kid, and only the best-- about $250,000 worth. [CAR APPROACHES] [CAR HORN BEEPS] I'd like to see Mr. Samson, please. He's busy. Would you tell him it's Mr. Judd? Steven Judd. Oh. Just one minute. Ahem. Excuse me, sir... Mr. Judd. MR. SAMSON: Let him come in, Abner. Mr. Samson will see you. Thank you. How do you do, Mr. Judd? I'm Luther Samson, and this is my son Abner. He's the vice president. I'm pleased to meet you, Mr. Judd-- well, I-- I must say, Mr. Judd, I expected a much younger man. Well, I used to be. We all used to be. Ah, yes. Yes, of course. Mr. Judd, we're familiar with your reputation-- thank you. But that was made many years ago. We're dealing in the present, not the past. What's the problem, gentlemen? The coarse gold strike is on the crest of the sierras. There's only one trail. One in, one out. 6 miners have been killed trying to get their gold down to us-- 6 miners killed and robbed, Mr. Judd. Several weeks ago, we petitioned for a marshal, but nothing happened. The only law up there is too drunk to hit the ground with his hat. The man we send up there must be completely reliable, to say nothing of being honest. We're speaking of gold, Mr. Judd, $20,000 worth. 20,000? Why, I thought your letter said 250,000. Our original estimate was overly enthusiastic. The strike is not a mother lode, but it is productive, slow and steady. And we intend to get our share. The days of the Forty- Niners are past. And the days of the steady businessmen have arrived. My usual fee is $20 a day. I'll have to charge you 40. $40? For what? For 2 extra men. I don't intend to go 4 days without sleeping. The question is-- the question is, can I do it? I can't answer that by talking about it, only by doing it. If you 2 want to talk about it, go ahead. I'll read the contract. Well, I--I guess that will be all right. In private, if you please. Why...Well, you can go in there. Whew. [TOILET FLUSHES] Well, the contract's all right. How about me? Any doubts? If not, I'll sign it. Oh. Well, I guess it's all right. That old man is Steve Judd? He don't look like much to me. Son, I wore a star for 6 years with that old man. I was his deputy most of the time. Once, he was mine. Don't ever play him short. I just don't figure him to be any trouble, that's all. I hope you're right, boy. I surely hope you're right. I'll be at the line. You demonstrate how impressed you are and keep your mouth shut. Hi, Mr. Westrum. Evening, honey. Hello, Heck. Stop that! What did I do? Never mind what you did. Don't do it in here. HECK: Can I pick you up in an hour? I think so. Too bad 'cause Heck won't be there. Why not? Because if I can't, you won't. Still keeping records, eh? You know me. Creature of habit. There's somebody else who wants to know you-- my partner, Heck Longtree. You'd blush to hear the way he admires you. How do you do? Howdy. Have a chair. Showing your age, aren't you? Huh? Interfering in a young man's love life. He's got more important things on his mind. Haven't you? Haven't you? Yes, sir, and so have I. Been considering your problem. Think maybe I can solve half of it, perhaps the whole thing. I know a fellow who's got an overwhelming hankering for a little old-time activity. It seems to me a man would have to be hard up to want to risk his life for $10 a day. $10 a day? [WHISTLES] Not hard up, just fed up. Outshooting the rubes for nickels and dimes-- it takes free drinks to sleep at night. My partner feels the same way. Don't you? Yeah. I don't think I'd want to hire a boy. Boy? What do you mean--a boy? Steve, this boy's a good deal less than green. He can't have too much behind him. That's where you're wrong. He's been dogging after me for better than 3 years. Pretty. Too bad he can't keep it clean. Boys nowadays... No pride, no self-respect. Plenty of gall, but no sand. Now, you take that race today. What about that race? Well, at that distance, no horse in the world could beat a camel. [CHAIR FALLS OVER] Are you calling me a cheat? Well, if he don't, I will. [MAN SPEAKING CHINESE] [SPEAKING CHINESE] Go get them, tiger. You're doing fine, just fine. What do you think, Steve? I think he's wonderful. He'll do. He'll do just fine. STEVE: What's the matter, partner? Your rheumatism bothering you? I'm used to working with my brain, not my backside. You think you can talk him into it? One way or another. I'd just as soon we split it 2 ways instead of 3. Kid, you got an awful lot to learn. [CHICKENS CLUCKING] [HORSES APPROACHING] Good afternoon. Good afternoon. Joshua Knudsen's the name. This is Gil Westrum and Heck Longtree. My name is Judd-- Steven Judd. I've heard the name. We're on our way to coarse gold. Wondered if you could furnish accommodations for the night? Well, I've got no room in the house, but I have no objections to you staying in the barn. Thank you, sir. If you could spare us a few eggs, we'd be glad to pay for them. One you can have, because the lord's bounty is not for sale. The rest are a dollar each. A dollar each? How do those short-legged chickens lay eggs so high? The levity of the young is like unto a dry gourd, with the seeds rattling round. [WHISTLES] My daughter, Elsa. How do you do? Pleased to meet you. Likewise. Go start supper, and change that dress. Change it? What for? For the good reason I told you to. Now, did you hear what I said? HECK: I think it's a real pretty dress. Thank you. JOSHUA: You can put your horses in the corral yonder. Supper will be ready in an hour. No charge. Lord's bounty-- is not for sale. Thank you, sir. HECK: Think of all that going to waste up here. Like the fellow said, gold is where you find it. And if it's not yours, don't covet it. Don't worry, boy. The lord's bounty may not be for sale, but the devil's is, if you can pay the price. GIL: There's a lot of truth in those words, Heck. Yeah? Yeah. ELSA: Supper's ready. Gentlemen... Heavenly father, we thank thee for the food on this table. Teach thy children to be grateful for thy goodness, to walk in thy path, that they may not suffer thy wrath... And thy vengeance. Bless us, o lord, and these, our guests, and forgive them the mercenary desires which brought them here. Amen. Thank you for entering a plea on our behalf, Mr. Knudsen, but what's this about mercenary desires? Ain't you on your way to coarse gold? Yes. Men only travel there to traffic in gold, which to possess is to live in fear, to desire, to live in sorrow. But we're not trafficking, sir, merely transporting. It says in the book, "Gold is a stumbling block "to them that sacrifice to it. And every fool shall be taken therewith." "A good name is rather to be chosen "than great riches, and loving favor rather than silver and gold." Proverbs, chapter 22. "Into the land of trouble and anguish "come the old lions, "and they shall carry their riches "on the shoulders of young asses to a people that shall not profit them." Isaiah 30:6. That mining town is a sinkhole of depravity, a place of shame and sin. According to my father, every place outside this farm is sinful. JOSHUA: That will do. You don't have to preach at everybody. That will do! You cook a lovely ham hock, miss Knudsen. Just lovely. Appetite, chapter 1. Give me a towel, and I'll dry. Shh! Thanks just the same. You hadn't better. Must be pretty lonely living up here. Sometimes, I get to thinking there's nobody left in the world but my father and me. You know, it's a crime-- a girl like you being stuck up on this old stump ranch. A girl like you ought to be living in the city-- San Francisco, say. You've been there? Uh-huh. Plenty of times. I never been anywhere. He won't even take me to town when he goes after supplies. Says the men would stare at me. Suppose-- suppose on the way back, I was to pick you up and take you to San Francisco or Denver or Chicago, even. JOSHUA: Elsa, who are you talking to in there? To myself. You better go. I'll meet you outside later. I can't! I'll wait for you by the corral. That boy you trained personally shows a substantial lack of judgment. Kind of showing your age, aren't you? Interfering with a young man's love life. Well, I'm not paying him $10 a day to go mooning after some girl whose old man's about to hind-end him with a load of buckshot. Know who she reminds me of, Steve? No. Sarah Truedale. Well, there's no resemblance at all. Maybe not in the features, but the way she smiles. There's the same look in her eyes when you're talking to her-- the kind of look that makes you feel you've said something really important. You and Sarah always looked so right together. Course, I can't say I blamed her for not marrying you. Forgetting the lousy money we made, what woman wants to sit around waiting for a husband to be brought home with his head shot off? I wonder if I can get these fixed in coarse gold. I guess losing Sarah was what you might call a hazard of our profession. That rancher she married-- uh...Stacy, is it? He's doing fine up in Idaho. Got a big ranch there. Raises blooded horses. Children, too, I hear. Grandchildren now. 3 of them. That right, Steve? Yep, that's right. 3 grandchildren. Think she's happy, Steve? If my sleeping bothers you, don't you bother to let me know. Sorry. Evening. You surely took your time. I shouldn't be here at all. Why? Does the night air bother you? If it does, come on up in the hay. I love the night air. The thing is, I'm what you might call engaged. Sure, you are. It's the truth. His name is Billy Hammond. He asked me to marry him... Several times. I said I thought I probably would. You'll see him in coarse gold. He's a miner up at the strike and doing real well. Well, if he's in coarse gold... And you're here, I don't see any harm in talking. You! Get in the barn and stay there! And you... Go to the house. [DOG HOWLING] "The mouth of a strange woman is a deep pit. Him that is abhorred of the lord shall fall therein." Won't you never learn any decency? We were only going to talk! Talk! The likes of him don't stop at talking. The likes of him? Every man I meet becomes "the likes of him"! He's no good. I can see it. That's all you see in anyone! Billy Hammond came here twice. You said he was evil! Sinful! I'm your father. I've got to keep the dirt away, protect you from the wrong kind of men. That means everyone, doesn't it? Every man is the wrong kind of man, except you! Aah... I promised the next time you hit me, you'd be sorry for it. "From my mouth shall speak truth, and wickedness is an abomination to my lips." "All the words of my mouth are in righteousness." Elsa... I'm sorry. "Receive my instruction, "not silver, knowledge rather than choice gold..." "For wisdom is better than rubies." Ahh... In 30 years, you'll like the feel of it, too! Pick that up! These mountains don't need your trash. Dandy pair of boots you got here. Juan Fernandez made those for me in San Antone, special order. I had a hell of a time getting him to put that hole in there. A fine craftsman, Juan, but he never did understand the principle of ventilation. I remember Juan. Always felt the boot should cover the foot. Short-sighted. Remember old doc Franklin-- the fancy boots he wore with the flaps over the toes? Had them made in Boston. Old doc-- know what happened to him? I heard he died. That's right. Old doc gave 30 years of his life to make the west safe for decent people. You'd have wept to see the way they turned out to pay him tribute, all 3 of them-- the mortician, the gravedigger, and me. Well, when I'm buried-- uh! I won't much care who comes to the funeral. I was commenting on the fairest flower that grows within the human heart-- gratitude. The only gratitude I expect is my paycheck-- $20 worth. That satisfies you? Well, I guess that's all I can hope for. Is it? According to my contract, it is. Come on. Let's get moving. [NICKER] You're just wasting your breath. He don't even know what you're talking about. He will in time. Let's bend a gun over his head and take off with the gold. Kid, you couldn't get close enough to Steve Judd to saddle his horse. Well, you could. Yes, I could, but I won't... Unless I have to. I hope heaven forgives us for earning this easy money. I seem to remember a man hankering for some old-time activity. I'd like to see some old-time mountains. As I recall, they sure were a lot easier to get around in. You sure complain a lot in your old age. Well, I got something to complain about. You're earning twice the money for taking the same risk. Plus possessing... All the other rewards you've gathered... During your years of loyal service-- a bluegrass thoroughbred, silver mounted saddle, magnificent wardrobe. I'm envious. What more can a man expect? What more can a man hope for? You forgot to mention my $2.00 watch. Waste of breath. What else can a man expect? I got to thinking about that one time. Well, sir, I keep records. When I became a lawman, the world lost a first-class bookkeeper. So, just to pass the time one day, I calculated what it was worth getting shot at. I figured it about $100 a shot. You'd have earned quite a sum by now. Getting hit-- I figure that's worth anywhere from 1,000 on up. That's 3,000 I know you got coming. 4 brings it up to date, and you tally up all those fights and bushwhackings and cold camps... That time in Lincoln county-- 5 weeks in the hospital and 6 months out of work. You add them all up, and I'd figure I was owed about all the gold we could carry out of these mountains. Something to dream about. Sure is. ELSA: Hey! Do you mind if I keep you company? HECK: I don't mind! I do. I'll second that. My advice to you, honey, is, turn around and ride back where you belong. I'm not going back to my father. I'm going to coarse gold to marry Billy Hammond. What do you want to do that for? ELSA: That's my affair. She's right, Heck. Our business is gold, not girls. Thanks for paying back our hospitality-- those lovely ham hocks and everything. I'm a strong believer in young love and gratitude, but not strong enough to bring you along in this country under these conditions. I'll ride by myself. We can make another 3 or 4 Miles before it gets dark. Right. Got to cover ground. Got a gun? No, I don't have a gun. Too bad. This is certainly Mountain lion country. It sure is. Build a fire. Chances are, it will scare them off. You both go on ahead. I couldn't sleep tonight with Elsa out here by herself. I'll stay with her and meet you in coarse gold. Go on ahead. Those Mountain lions-- some don't scare so easy. Come along, girl. Do you remember old man Teaford? Oh, yeah. Ha ha ha! Ha ha ha! "All night, Logan." Ha ha ha! "Way up, Logan." Ha ha ha! You know, the way you do your hair looks real nice. You think so? Mm-hmm. Pa had me cut it short. Sort of it fits the shape of your head when you see it from the side. Yeah, like that. You know, most girls don't know the first thing about their hair. I guess you're an authority on what most girls do. Well, I've studied the subject-- not just what they do, but why. Now, you take this getting married. You think it's such a good idea? If I didn't, I wouldn't be here. I guess you're doing it to get away from your pa-- to get even, maybe. I guess your guess is as good as anybody's. Well, if it's wrong, how come you ran away? Because my father doesn't want me to get married. Oh, he says he does... If I can find a decent young man... But nobody's decent according to him. You included. Said you were no good. Said the likes of you don't stop at talking. You know, he has a point there. Don't move! Don't move, Elsa. No! Heck, no! Let me go! No! No! Heck, no! No! Let me go! My, oh, my. When I questioned you about that boy, I should have gone a bit deeper into the subject of character. I hope that's a mistake I won't live to regret. Good fight. I enjoyed it. That old man? That old man is about half-rough. You learned a lesson, didn't you? I surely did. Got room for another? Let her fly. We're not here for romance. Understand me, son? Yes, sir. I hope Mr. Judd didn't hurt you too bad. I guess it's kind of my fault. What do you mean, kind of? I acted silly. I'm sorry. I do like you, Heck. Save the sugar-talk for your Billy-boy because I don't need it. I guess not! What you need's a girl who'd go with you to San Francisco or Denver! Right. There's plenty of them. I changed my mind. You got just what you deserve! You got something to say? No. I think she about covered everything. [DOG BARKING] Lovely place. Beauty spot of nature. A garden of Eden for the sore in heart and short of cash. We didn't come here to enjoy the scenery. [SPLASH] [WOMEN LAUGHING] I see our crochet and garden society seems to be having their weekly meeting. When we get located, pass the word around that we're in camp and ready for business. And you! Find the Hammond claim and take her there. Why me? Because Steve and I will be busy collecting gold. It's not too late. You can change your mind. I came to coarse gold to be married, and that's what I'll be--married. Well, good luck, then. All the happiness in the world. [WOMAN LAUGHING] Welcome to coarse gold! This seems to be the place to find it. You might be in for a big surprise. How do you know Billy-boy still wants to marry you? What do you care? I don't! Is this the Hammond claim? Who wants to know? I do. I'm looking for Billy Hammond. You found him! Billy! BILLY: Howdy, Elsa! I can't believe it, honey! MAN: Looks like the girl he's been going down the Mountain to see. I'll say one thing. She's sure worth the trip. Wish I'd got there first. Looks like a warm one. Hey, where's your pa at? Back home. You mean you run off and come all the way here just to see me? ELSA: See you? I brought my mother's wedding dress... If you still want to. If I want to! If he don't, you got 4 others to choose from! A sweet thing like you would have the pick of the litter! No rush about making up your mind. BILLY: Don't you listen to them! We're going to get married tonight! I guess that will be all, Mr. Longtree. By the way... Just who is Mr. Longtree? I rode up with him from the farm. That's a couple of days on the trail, ain't it? That's right. 2 days and 2 nights. MAN: Couple of nights? Couple of nights on the trail. ELSA: Billy! There were two other men with us from the bank in town! Besides... Mr. Longtree was a perfect gentleman. How come? Something wrong with him? Well, now, I don't think I ever met a perfect gentleman before, Mr. Longtree. [LAUGHTER] You come back and see us real soon, now, you hear, Mr. Longtree? Jimmy, Sylvus, Elder, come on down here! I want you to meet my woman! Ha ha ha! Come on. Elsa, honey, this is Jimmy. He's sort of the baby of the family, and that there's Sylvus. He's been doing our cooking, as you can see. The one on the end is Elder. He's the head of the clan. I want you to meet my favorite brother. Henry! Get down here, now! Come on! Henry's sort of our banker, you might say. Come on, honey. I'll show you my tent. [LAUGHING] [CAW CAW] Looks like you've got a pretty good claim. Ha ha! It's a gold mine, honey. Why don't you come over and take a look? You're invited, too. Ha ha ha! GIL: Find Billy Hammond? Yeah. STEVE: What's he like? What difference does it make? She wanted him. Now she's got him. I don't want to shave! Jimmy, you'll shave whether you want to or not. You been running around with that peach fuzz long enough. I want that girl to know she's marrying into a family of men! Ha ha ha! Hey, Billy. Thank you, Sylvus. Now haul it. What's that for? You're leaving. Go on. I see no sense in moving out just because you're honeymooning here. I don't have time to explain it to you. Just get out! I ain't going. You just did! [CAW] Takes care of him. I got to clean up in here! Plenty of time for that later, honey! No, uh... I want to do it now. No, you don't. But the place is filthy! It will wait. It will wait! Let go, Billy. Billy, let me go! All right. Calm down. Come on, honey. See you later. If you need any help... Fastening up your wedding dress, you just holler, you hear? I'll manage. HENRY: First drink is best, east or west! Let him go! Turn him loose! Jimmy, it's going to make a man of you, now! Say, Henry. I been wanting to ask you something. Something's been on my mind. Was you planning to bathe for the wedding? No, sir. You weren't going to clean up for your brother's wedding? No, sir, I ain't. I didn't wash when cousin got wed back home. That bride didn't seem to mind none, did she, Billy? Now, there will be none of that. None of what? You know something, Sylvus? Billy is getting small-minded about that woman. And a might feisty. A few drinks under his belt will change his mind, and liquor always did have a softening effect on Billy. I'd hate to get married with my brother smelling bad enough to gag a dog off a gutwagon. Yeah, that's so. Now, you wouldn't want that sweet little thing to think we're less than quality, would you? All I know is that after tonight, she ain't going to be able to think enough about me. Huh? Ha ha ha! Ha ha ha! Ha ha ha! Yeah! Yeah! Pick him up! Yeah! Get him in there! Yeah! Oh! Ha ha ha! Hoo! Hey! Ha ha ha! All right, let him up. Let me out! I ought to cut you! BILLY: Look at that, Henry. Henry, Henry. Come on now, Henry. SYLVIUS: Oh, easy now, Henry. Oh, we's just funning you, Henry. Be easy. Put the knife up, Henry. You could cut yourself. Is that a smile I see coming on? How about it there, Henry? Hey, Henry, come on. Easy, now, Henry!

It'll do you good. BILLY: Cheers, Elsa. Heck. 11,486. That's a far cry from a quarter of a million. Fortunes of war. Hardly worth it. All depends on where you stand. I guess that's right. To a poor man, 11,000 is just as far away as 250,000. Where are you going? Out for some fresh air. Any objections? We're gathered here in the high mountains in the presence of this August company to join this man and this woman in matrimony. Now, I'm not a man of the cloth, and this is not a religious ceremony. It's a civil marriage. But it's not to be entered into unadvisedly, but reverently and soberly. A good marriage has a kind of simple glory about it. A good marriage is like a rare animal. It's hard to find. It's almost impossible to keep. You see, people change. That's important for you to know at the beginning. People change. The glory of a good marriage don't come at the beginning. It comes later on, and it's hard work. Billy, do you take this woman to be your lawful wedded wife till God by death shall separate you? I do. And...What's your name again? Elsa Knudsen. Do you, Elsa, promise to take this man to be your lawful wedded husband till death does separate you? I do. Oh...You have a ring? By the authority vested in me, I hereby pronounce you man and wife. [CHEERING] KATE: All right, girls, change your clothes. Ha ha ha! Henry! Henry! Henry! Move, Henry. No, Sylvus, Sylvus. Now, that's enough, Sylvus. Don't go messing in here. Get out of the way. [KATE LAUGHING] [MUSIC PLAYING] MAN: Hee hee ha! Hey, bartender, pour a little more. No use standing here tormenting yourself, son. Come on. I'll buy you a drink. Ha ha! What a party! We got to have a wedding in this family every week! Come on, Billy. Get over there and get her crated around. Ha ha ha! Let me in there. Ha ha ha! Ha ha ha! Have fun, honey. Billy! Billy! Now, come on. It's my turn, Sylvus. I told you not to do that! Sylvus, behave yourself. Looks like Jimmy's making a man out of himself. Be a nice boy, Sylvus. Go comb your hair. You look terrible. I told you not to do that! Don't be like that, Sylvus. Aw, come on, now. Sylvus, we got a nice party now. Why don't you behave yourself? You can't hit my brother! Don't leave me. I wish I'd known more about those brothers. It's too late now. She's married. I'm glad they didn't invite me to the ceremony. I always cry at weddings. You know, Mr. Westrum, the more I am around you, the more I can do without your sense of humor. Come on, break it up! Come on, boys, get over there. I said break it up, and I mean it. Sylvus, get over here and behave yourself. Get over there! MAN: I haven't seen Jimmy. Where is he? No, Billy. Come on. No. Well, now, get on in there. Ah! Easy now, Elsa. Listen, Elsa, you come here! No, Billy. No, Billy. No. Not here. No, Billy! Now, you straighten out, you hear me? MAN: Where's Billy? Ho ho ho ha ha! Ha ha ha! I got some prying brothers. [ELSA SCREAMING] You stay here. [SCREAMING] She's mine! She's mine! Henry, turn me loose! SYLVIUS: Come back, Elsa! Get ahold of that girl! Billy, get your bride. Hold it. Let her go. Where you going with my wife? She's staying with us tonight. I'm taking her back to her father. Like hell she will. You can't take a wife away from her husband. TOLLIVER: A clear case of breaking and entering. Ha ha ha! They're legally married, right, Judge? I now pronounce you man and wife, and don't you forget it. Go along, Elsa. Heck. You're not leaving this camp with her, I'll promise you that. Don't you forget it. Ha ha ha! Come on, Billy. Billy, wake up, Billy. What happened? You all right, Billy? Where is she? Where is she? I'll kill her! Where'd they go with her? Huh? Are you letting them get away with her? The marriage didn't work out. We'll take her back to her father. Steve, we've got our hands full already. I don't like it any better than you do. Oh! [SOBBING] Too big, huh? What are they doing there? We're willing to abide by the court's decision if you are. We'll abide. Don't be scared. What's wrong? Billy Hammond wants Elsa. They've appointed a miner's court to decide the issue. Miner's court? That's the law in places like this. Who says? They do, and there's a lot more of them than us. Billy's very sorry about last night. He swears nothing like it will ever happen again. I believe him. I wouldn't believe-- I don't want to go back to him! You were legally married of your own free will. Please. You can't let him take me back. You can't! We'll do the best we can, but whatever they decide will have to be it. No, it don't. She's not going with him. She stays with us. She stays here. We're packing gold, not petticoats. If she stays, I stay. Well, let's hope the court lets her go with us. Otherwise, we'll be a little short-handed. All right, gentlemen, we can proceed. In the first place, I married this gal here last night at Kate's place... Where can I find Judge Tolliver? The end of the hall, mister. ...married us legal and proper. [GRUNTING] Easy. Sit up. A little more. Ahh... Thank you, sir. What can I do for you? Clear up a little technicality, if you will, about that marriage last night. They're holding a miner's court, and they'll want to know if it was legal. Course it's legal. Well, I believe that, but the court may want proof in the form of a license. You got one? Mm-hmm. Signed by the governor of California. Yes, sir, there's no question at all about the legality of this document. Judge, when you testify before that miner's court, I'm going to ask you one question-- do you possess a license to marry people in California? And you're going to answer no. Am I clear? That's a lie. No, it isn't. You don't possess it. I do. Now, see here-- listen to me, you fat-gutted soak. You'll do as you're told. Now, do you recall the question I'm going to ask? And what do you answer? No. Very good. Let's go. [FIGHTING SOUNDS] According to the law, she's still married to Billy Hammond. You and the law. She can get it nullified. Will that satisfy your ironbound code of ethics? My code satisfies pretty easy, partner. Would it surprise you to know that I was once a lawbreaker? Ha ha! Well, bless my stars. About the age of that boy back there, skinny as a snake and just about as mean. Ran around with the hole in the wall bunch. Gun-happy, looking for trouble or a pretty ankle. Had the world by the tail, so to speak. Then one night, Paul Staniford picked me up. He was sheriff for madera county then. There'd been a fight, and I was drunk, sicker than a fat dog. Well, sir, he dried me out in jail, and then we went out back, and he kicked the bitter hell right out of me. Ha ha! That took some doing. Not much. See, he was right. I was wrong. That makes the difference. Who says so? Nobody. That's something you just know. Anyhow, when I was able to walk again, I realized I'd learned a lesson from him-- the value of self-respect. What's that worth on the open market? Nothing to some people. A great deal to me. But I lost it. These last years, the only work I was able to get was places like Kate's back there-- bartender, stick man, bouncer, what have you. Not much to brag on. But now I'm getting back a little respect for myself, and I intend to keep it with the help of you and that boy back there. Good to be working again, Gil. Yeah. Partner, do you know what's on the back of a poor man when he dies? The clothes of pride. And they're not a bit warmer to him dead than they were when he was alive. Is that all you want, Steve? All I want is to enter my house justified. Thank you. Will you stay in town when we get back? I'm not just certain. Why? You're right, kid. Been wasting my breath. Tonight, we move. I don't know. You don't know what? I started out thinking he was an old mossback, but I changed my mind. I kind of hate to turn against him. Are you with me or not? What'll happen to Elsa? He'll deliver her to her father. The thing for you to remember is that we made a deal. Yes, sir. It all pointed this way-- all that talk about old doc Franklin, ungrateful citizens, what we had coming but never got paid. It's the truth, isn't it, Steve? I knew in my bones what you were aiming for, but I wouldn't believe it. I kept telling myself you were a good man. You were my friend. This is bank money, not yours. And what they don't know won't hurt them-- not them, only me! Take off your gun belt and toss it over here. What are you going to do? You always fancied yourself faster than me. Go ahead. Draw. Draw, you damn tinhorn! That was your second mistake tonight and the last chance you'll ever get from me. I'm going to put you behind bars, Gil. You'll play hell getting it done. Move! My, oh, my. Will you look who's here? Howdy. You made pure fools out of us, stealing that license from Tolliver, but the Judge says there's another one on file in Sacramento. That means she's still my wife. Come on, honey. Let's go home. She stays with us. Looks to me like you people been having some trouble. Looks to me like somebody got their finger caught in the cookie jar. You're short-handed, old-timer, but she's all we want-- all we want provided we get her now! You heard me. We'll get her sooner or later. Like hell you will! Ha ha ha! You better cut yourself a switch, Mr. Longtree. I don't think you could handle me barehanded, but you'll get a chance to try directly. Come on. Heck, do I have your word you'll return your gun when this is over? Yes, sir. I reckon you do. I'll go along. You bet you'll go along. We're moving in to the rocks. Steve! Shut up! Move! Move out! [GUN CLICKS] [GUN CLICKS] GIL: You're really showing your age, partner. Back in the old days, you'd have checked those rifles before we left camp. I'll get around behind them. Don't waste your time. They're too far away. Yah! He's going around behind us. Steve, cut me loose and give me a gun. I'll get a rifle for you. Start shooting. Sylvus! Sylvus! He was carrying a rifle. Let's get out of here! [GUNSHOTS] Looks like they got Sylvus! I know that. Come on! We're getting out! You're getting out? You got 2 brothers dead. You're talking about running? Come on! [CLANK] I wonder where those other 3 went. All I hope is that they're not still following us. GIL: Calm your fears, honey. I'd guess they gave up and went back to coarse gold. Assuming that's so, I'll have your gun back. Did you hear me, boy? Sorry, Mr. Judd. I guess I was showing off. What happens when we get back to town? STEVE: That's up to the sheriff. He's turning us in. You know that. So do I. Ever hear of Folsom Prison, Heck? No. Well, it's solid rock. During the years we spend there, we'll discuss the events of the past few minutes at great length. By the time you get out, you won't like them any better than I do now, which isn't one hell of a lot. Where do I sleep? STEVE: Up there. I don't want to see you till breakfast. Cut me loose, Steve. Why? Because I don't sleep so good anymore. HECK: Night. Night. My father says there's only right and wrong, good and evil-- nothing in-between. It isn't that simple, is it? No, it isn't. It should be, but it isn't. What's going to happen to him? The boy? I'll testify for him. They shouldn't be too hard. Will you testify for Mr. Westrum? No, I won't. Why? Because he was my friend. How come he don't tie us up? What for? No place to go. He's got the horses, and he's got the guns, and it wouldn't take long for Steve Judd to find us. Wait a minute, kid. I just had a thought. Well, keep it to yourself. I'm fed up with you and your ideas. That's all right. That's all right. Morning. HECK: Morning. STEVE: Where's Gil? Gone. ELSA: Why didn't you go with him? Because I didn't see any future in our partnership. Come along. Get up there. You wait here. I'll go down and take a look around. The old gent's taken quite a chance. I don't think so. Neither does he. I never figured it would turn out this way. Chances are, I'll be locked up for quite a while. I've got no call to bring it up, but maybe when I get out... I'll be there. I saw your father. Everything's all right. What are you doing? That's strange. What? He goes to her grave every day, but always in the morning, never in the afternoon. We're going to the ditch. Now! I walked right into it. [GUNSHOTS] I'll try for the corral. Oh! [BIRD SQUAWKING] Hey! I got him. Well, where's the rifle? On the horse. Bad? Not yet. [GUNSHOTS] Partner, what do you think? Let's meet them head-on, halfway, just like always. My sentiments exactly. You Hammonds! What do you want, old man? He wants a shovel and 6 feet of dirt! You redneck peckerwoods! You're too chicken-gutted to finish this thing out in the open! Two old men against all 3 of you boys! If them odds ain't enough for you damn dry-gulchin' Southern trash, we'll send out the girl! We're coming! You hear me, Henry? I hear you. You don't have to ask me twice! Now, you hold on, Billy. We'll catch them when they raise up. Ain't you got no sense of family honor? Start the ball, old man! How'd we figure? $1,000 a shot? Yeah. Those boys sure made me a lot of money. They put them all in one spot. I don't want them to see this. I'll go it alone. Don't worry about anything. I'll take care of it just like you would have. Hell, I know that. I always did. You just forgot it for a while, that's all. So long, partner. I'll see you later.
