- 911, what's your emergency? - Yes, I have an emergency. There's someone in my house. - And where are you? - I'm in my bedroom. He has a gun, please help me. - Can you get out? - No, I'm upstairs, there's no way out. - Now, since you're on a cellphone, sweetheart, I need your exact address. - 91505 Sharer's Drive. Please send the entire police force. I'm really scared, please. - All right, sweetheart. They are already on their way. - Thank you, thank you so much. - Now, what I need you to do is lock the door if you can and hid in the closet. The police will be there in minutes. - Okay, thank you. Bye. - No, no, no. I'm gonna stay on the phone with you until they get there. - No, that's okay. It's better if I stop talking. - No, it's protocol, please don't hang up. That's how we have direct communication with you just in case. - Just in case what? - Just in case there is a hostage situation. I hear them on your street right now, sweetheart. All right, hang tight. You hang with me. - Sure, thanks. I'm gonna hang up now. Bye. - No, it's. - Hold your positions! - My God, you're a genius. - Martinez, come on. I need you out back. - Go, go, go, go! - All clear, clear! - How'd you know that would work? - I saw it on TV once. It's called swatting. - This is the Calabasas Police Department. We have the house surrounded. Come out with your hands up. - We could get into serious trouble. - Put down your weapons. - No, we can't. - And come out with your hands up. - They don't know it was us. - Sure, they do, they could track your phone. They'll be here next. - I have an app on my phone that makes it untraceable. - Look, the front door's opening. - Get 'em up! Let's go, move your feet. - On the ground! - Don't shoot! - Let's go, move! - Get down on the ground! - Hands up! - Don't move! - Come out slowly. - Yes, sir, we've got them now. Near the house. Move! Move! - Get 'em up, both of you! Let's go. - On your feet! On your feet! - Clear the house! - Come on! - Scotty is seriously pissed. Did you see his face? - He knows it was us. - He can't prove it. Anyway, if he dares tell anyone it was us, I'll tell the police that it was him who broke into Ms. Augmore's house and stole her English test. - Are you sure? - How long have we been friends? - A long time. - And have I ever done anything to betray your trust? - Well, there was that one time you told on me... - We were six years old. - I can't believe we're actually moving to Los Angeles. - It's not so bad, Sierra. In fact, it's not that much different than Denver, you know? There are movie theaters and restaurants and... - Really? It's dirty, full of traffic, and it's loaded with stuck-up people. - Not where we're going. - Mom, don't sugarcoat it. - Hey, sweetheart, can we please try to find something positive in all this, - No, I can't. - Come here. Hey, I'll be there and when I get there, hopefully, you can introduce me to all your new friends and show me all the new cool hangouts. - I don't think so. - Please, you have to try, okay? - Okay, Mom, I'll try. - I love you, peanut. - I love you, Mom. - Okay, now, drive safely. - I will. - And remember that it's winter, so the roads are gonna be dangerous through the Rockies. And, okay, make sure he doesn't fall asleep. And make that house real pretty for me, all right? With a girl's a touch. - What? You think if Sierra wasn't comin' with me, the place would look like a bachelor pad? - Yeah. - I love you. - Love you. - Okay. I'll see ya in a week. Muah! - See ya soon, sweetheart. - Love you so much, see you soon. - Okay. - And we're here. - This is it? - This is it. - Well, what do ya think? - It's bigger and prettier than the pictures. - Yeah, ya like it? - I mean, it's no Aurora, but it's nice. You did good, I'm impressed. - Come on, let's get the truck unloaded. - Kaitlyn, come on, we have to stop at my house before cheer practice. What are you looking at? Colorado plates? - That's a long drive. - She's pretty. Let's go meet her. - I don't know. - Why not? She's your neighbor. - Okay, but if she turns out to be the neighbor from hell, it's your fault. - Sure, but you're still gonna have to live with her. - Hi. - Hi. - I'm Kaitlyn, I live across the street. And this is Alexis. What's your name? - I'm Sierra. It's nice to meet you. - So what are you into? - Clothing, boys, movies. - Well, it sounds like you'll fit in perfectly here. Hey, a bunch of us are going to the rollerskating rink tonight. You wanna come? I don't know, I. - Come on, it'll be a great chance to meet some of the kids you'll be going to school with. - Sure, that sounds really fun. - Great, meet us at the roller rink on Westlake Drive at 6:00 p.m. - Got it. - Bye. - Bye. - Bye. - Well, look at that. Makin' friends already, Come on, don't fall. - So many more things to unload. - That's not my problem. - Yeah. Thanks for driving me. - Well, I've been told that's what dads do. Yeah? Whoa, there, young lady. - What? You gonna give me one of those stereotypical parent talks? - Just remember, I was a teenager once, too, you know? Please be smart. - Dad. - I have the app, I know where you are at all times. - Really? You're gonna use the app here, too? Dad. - Just tell me you'll be safe and smart. - Yes, I'll be safe and smart. - No, no, no. You're just sayin' that to get rid of me. Come on, say it with some conviction. - I love you, everything will be fine. - I love you, too. - Bye. - Bye. - Yeah, yeah. - Yo, B. - Hey, you made it. - Hey. - You look so cute. - Thanks, you, too. - Come on, I'll introduce you to everyone. - Great. - Hey, guys. This is my new neighbor, Sierra. She's from Colorado. - Hey, Colorado. - Hi, Colorado. - Hi. - Hi, everyone. - Anyways, this is Terri, Cindy, Aubrey. Lance. - Hey. - David, Marcy, Jade, Michael, Jonathan, Kayla, Jana, and Tamra. - Hello. - Hi, Lexi. - Alexis, you can't call me Lexi yet. You have to earn that right. Earn it, Colorado. Okay, how do I do that? - It's all about trust. There's a lotta gossip that goes on in a town like Calabasas, so I need to know whose side you're on. - There's sides? - There's a lotta cliques. You'll find out eventually. - But don't worry. Right now, you're in our group. - Until they throw you out and kick you to the ground. - Nice burn, Erin. - She crossed me, that's why she's not in the group. - What did she do? - She turned me in for cheating. - That wasn't very nice of her. Were you? - Was I what? - Cheating? - Of course, I was. Doesn't everyone? I'll never forgive her. Anyway, enough about her. Tell me about you. Come on. - Bye. - Bye, Colorado. - Later, Colorado. Go, Colorado! Go, Colorado, go! Go, Colorado! Go, Colorado, go! Hey! - Whoa! - Go, Colorado, go! Hey, hey, hey! - See that girl over there? In the pink shirt? - Yeah. - That's Shannon O'Neill. She crossed me once, too. - What did she do? - She stole my boyfriend. - That's not cool. - No, it wasn't. And now she has to pay for it. - Pay for it, what do you mean? - Just watch. Keep your eyes on Kaitlyn. - I'm so good! - Woo-hoo! - My God! - I don't know what I did now. - What's happening? - Just watch carefully. This is gonna be great. - Hey, Brutus! - Just give it a few seconds. It needs time to dry. - Are you sure about that? - I tested it 10 times. - Woo-hoo! - Come on. - Help me! - It worked perfectly. Nice work, Kaitlyn. - Thanks. - Shannon, are you okay? Whoa! Are you okay, Shannon? - What'd you think? - I mean, I thought it was funny. I just hope nobody got hurt. - She's fine. Anyway, she hurt me plenty. - Come on, guys, I love this song. - What about you, Cindy? - Hey, so a few of us are coming back to my place to hang out, smoke a little weed, have a drink. - I wish I could, but my dad is coming to get me. - Call and tell him you're gonna stay at my place. - Your parents would be okay with that? - My dad's not around anymore and my mom's outta town this week. So, yeah, it's fine. - Your mom let you stay home alone for a whole week? - Are you that sheltered? - No, but, well, I just thought that... - Don't worry about it. It's sort of endearing. - Well, I should probably get going. Thank you for inviting me. I just don't think my dad would be ready for me staying the night yet. - Of course, I totally understand. See ya later? - Yeah, definitely. - Okay. - Good night, everyone. - Bye. - Bye, Colorado. - Great to meet you. - She's cool? - Yeah, I like her. Bit naive, but she's malleable. - Malleable? - In no time, I can turn her into one of us. Lexi, how late were we drinking? - I don't know, why? - My God, I have the worst headache. - That's because you can't handle your alcohol. - I hardly had any. - My point exactly. I wanna show you something. Why the hell are you home already? - Is that any way to talk to your mother? - Are you my mother? I forgot, I mean, most mothers are with their children, instead of screwing everything that moves. - I only screw the good-lookin' ones. - When did you stop drinking? This morning? - It's none of your business. Now, you leave me the hell alone and clean up this mess. You kids are a bunch of slobs. Get up! Clean up my house. - You're stalking Sierra? - Sure, why not? - Why would you stalk her? - You're serious, right? You're telling me you don't stalk people when you first meet them? - Okay, I guess, you're right. - Anyway, look what I found. Read it. - "I have to get out of Denver. "The pressure is just too much. "Everyone knows it's not my fault, "but they're still treating me like some pariah." - Read this post. - "Thank God my father got a job in Los Angeles. "I can finally get past this and move on with my life." That's so heartbreaking. I mean, it sounds like she was having a really hard time. I wonder what she's talking about. - Cry me a river. It sounds to me like she did something and won't admit that it was her fault. - I mean, maybe she just wasn't fitting in with the kids at school. - What makes her think she could fit in with us if she couldn't fit in there? - Well, I mean, she's my neighbor now. It'd be really awkward if she wasn't a part of the group and she lives right across the street from me. - Okay, we'll give her a chance. But if she does anything to cross us, she's going down. Hard. - I haven't even seen houses this big in Cherry Creek. - What'd you say? I'm sorry. Hi, I'm Lance. We met at the roller rink the other night. - Hi, I remember you. You left early though, right? - Yeah, I had to go home. It was a shame we couldn't hang out more. - Do you always creep up on girls like that? - Only when they're talking to themselves. What were you saying? - I was just saying how much I admire Lexi's house. - Well, her dad is a wealthy businessman who cheated on Lexi's mom with the nanny. Now, they live here alone, together. - That explains some things. - Explains what? - Well, Lexi has a lotta freedom. My parents are on me 100% of the time. - Yeah, so are mine. I guess they care. What do ya say we get in there and get this party started? - I mean, the party doesn't start without us, right? - Right. Let's go. - Okay. Wow. This is amazing. - This is what money buys you. - Hey! - Hey. - Did you two come together? - No, we just arrived at the same time. - Don't worry, Lexi, we aren't dating yet. - Yet? - Well, I mean, we just met. - Well, knowing you, you've already made a move on this sweet, innocent girl. - Hey, I'm not that innocent. - We'll see. Come on, Colorado. How 'bout I pour you a drink? - You have so many friends. - Yeah, I know, right? - And this house is just amazing. - You should come stay the night sometime. - Really? - Of course. We're friends now, aren't we? - Yeah. There's a lotta people here. - Yeah, well, I like to invite everyone. - That's nice of you. Okay, so who should I know? Who should I not know? Who should I date? - See those kids over there? They're the jocks. They're cool, but they can't do anything by themselves. - They have rocks for brains. - Over there are the dweebs. They're the gamers and theater geeks. If you wanna be really bored, hang with them. - Who's that guy standing by himself? - That's Jake. - What category does he fall into? - He's pretty much in his own category. - What does that mean? - It means he's weird. No one really hangs out with him. - That's sad. Why'd you invite him? - I mean, we've all pretty much known each other our entire lives. - Yeah, he's just always been around. - I know that face. - What face? - It's that, "I have a prank face." - Come here. Jake! Come on. Yeah, you, over here. - Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa! Whoa, man. - Hey, Jake, I want you to meet the new girl. Jake, this is Sierra. Sierra, this is Jake. - Hi, how ya doin'? - Good, thanks for asking. - What ya drinkin'? - Just a beer. Hey, Kaitlyn, would you wanna go out sometime? Sorry, I honestly didn't mean nothing by that. I just kinda thought we've all known each other for so long that, well, I just... Damn, I messed up again. - No, you didn't, it's fine. Listen, just relax and I'll go over there and hang out for a little while. - Sure, that'd be fine. Thanks. - Bye. - I'll be right back. I'm just gonna run to the restroom. - Any second now, he won't know what hit him. And, then, you can take advantage of him. - Over my dead body. - Yeah, he was out havin' a little too much. - It happens. - Aw, man. Happens every time. - Exactly, every. - It's a whole bunch of different things. It's just somewhere else. - Hey, what's goin' on, man? How you doin'? - My God! Someone's at the bottom of the pool! Please, help, he's gonna die! Come on! - Let's go, let's go! - Dammit. - Man, you're kidding me. Let's go, let's go! Come on! That's it, come on! - Does anyone know CPR? - I do! I do! Come on, come on, stay with us. - Lance, hello? Is he okay? - Stay with us, come on. - Someone call 911, someone! - How long was he under? How long? - Lance, it's gonna be okay. - Come on, stay with us. Stay with us. - What happened? - Okay, come on. - If you tell anyone what we did, you'll be very sorry. - Come on, man, come on. Come on! - What we did? - Yes, what we did. - You're the one who put the GHB in his drink. - I'm trying, but he's not coming back. - You were there, you could've stopped me, but you didn't. - Lance. - So could she. - Lance, is he okay? Is he all right? - You're both just as culpable, so you better not say anything. - Is he all right? - Got it? - Come on. - Should we call the cops? - I think so. - Yes, I've got it. I won't tell anyone. - Come on. - You better not. Come on. - Hang on. - My God. Stay with us! - Jake? - Do not give up. - Come on. - He's not dead, man. - Come on, man. - Okay, so you gave the victim CPR, but he was not responsive. - Yes, sir. - Was he acting strangely or was he doing any drugs? - I'm not sure... - Lexi, what the hell is going on here? - I am so sorry, Mom. A boy drowned in our pool and I... - Drowned, what was he doing? - I don't know, someone found him at the bottom. - Dammit, Lexi, I thought I could trust you. - It's not my fault, I didn't do it! Where are you going? - I'm gonna deal with the police and try to clean up your mess. - But, Mom! - Sorry your first day of school was so dreary. - So what did the cops ask you after the party? - They just wanted to know what I saw. - Yeah, they just asked me some basic questions. - Me, too. They said they wouldn't really know anything until after the autopsy. - Autopsy? - Sure. They always do an autopsy when they don't know the exact cause of death. - What do you mean? He drowned. - The detective said he probably had drugs and alcohol in his system. - Well, duh, he was drinking beer the entire night. What more are they gonna find out? Don't they have better things to spend our tax money on? - Jake was a good kid. I can't believe he's gone. - Were you friends with him? - We were friends through elementary school. But he was a loner in junior high. I tried to help him, but I think something serious was going on at home. - That was really nice of you to try. - Thanks. - You have got to be kidding me, Lance. I don't remember you ever trying to help Jake. In fact, I distinctly remember you and your buddies bullying him. - That's ridiculous, Lexi. Don't spread garbage you know isn't true. - You callin' me a liar? - Yes, I am. - What exactly did you tell the police? - What do you mean? I just told them what I saw. - Well, you didn't tell them you saw Jake getting the alcohol from my house, did you? - I mean, they didn't ask me that. - Well, you better not. What's so funny? - I just find it really amusing that Lexi, the queen of the school, is actually the most insecure person I've ever met. - I am not insecure. What are you laughing at? - Actually, I didn't laugh, but all your so-called friends did. - Come on, Kaitlyn. - Good bye. You just stood up to Lexi Cooper, impressive. - You did, too. - I've been wanting to do that for years. She's the menace of this school. She'll be back to her old tricks soon enough. Anyway. How about I drop you off after school? Come on. This is it, right? - Yeah. - This is where Scotty used to live. - Scotty? - Yeah. He was a buddy of mine, but his parents just got up and left when there was a swatting prank played on them. - Swatting? - Yeah, it's when someone calls the police about an intruder or something, and the entire SWAT team shows up. - Bet that made the police mad. - Sure, it did. It also horrified Scotty's parents. They could've easily gotten shot. - So who do you think called in the prank? - Who do you think? - Lexi? - Of course, she did. - I don't know exactly, but what if Lexi put something in Jake's drink that night? - You think she spiked his drink with something? - She was definitely up to something. - I mean, swatting is one thing, but drugging someone's drink is a whole other thing. - Thank you for today. - For what? - You could've easily turned away like all the others did. You're different than the others. Why is that? - I don't know. I guess you'll have to figure that out. How about I meet you here in the morning and drive you to school? - I'd like that. - So would I. How does 7:30 sound? - Bye. - Bye. - He dropped her off. - I hate him! - Lexi, I'm really worried about that autopsy report. - There's nothing to worry about because we didn't kill Jake! - Mom! - Sierra, honey. - Mom, I thought you weren't gonna be here until Thursday. - Yeah, well, I pulled every resource I could and completed my project so I could be here with you and Dad. That's some hug. Are you all right? - Yes and no. - Honey, Dad told me what happened at the party. That's horrible. - Yeah. That was the hardest first day I've ever had. Not just because of Jake, but some of the girls were hating on me. - I'm so sorry, sweetie. - Well, one good thing did happen. - Yeah, that's my girl. Always a silver lining, tell me. - I met a boy. - On the first day? - Well, we met last week at the roller rink and then, again, at a party. But he just drove me home from school. - Well, that was nice of him. - Yeah, it was. - Well, I'm glad that something went well and things are only gonna get better. - How do you like the house? - You did a great job, and I especially love how you arranged the living room. - You should be lucky that I was here. Dad was putting all the furniture in all the wrong places. - Of course, he was. Come here. Show me the upstairs. - Yeah. - Okay. - Let's do it. - As reported yesterday, Jake Thompson, a senior here at Hidden Hills High School, died Saturday night in a pool at a home during a house party. We just received the coroner's report from the autopsy and as suspected, they did find traces of alcohol in his system. More importantly, though, they also found traces of GHB. The question for the detectives on this case is whether or not the young man took this drug voluntarily. We will continue to follow this case as more information comes in. This Anne Billing signing off. - Wow, I can't believe this happened at your school. - Those aren't your normal high school drugs. - No, he had GHB in his system. - I think I've heard of that. Don't they call it something else? - Well, it's also known as liquid ecstasy. It's the date-rape drug. It'll knock you out so much you can't... - Can't swim. - Yeah, or save yourself from drowning. - Do you think someone mighta slipped that into his drink? - No. I mean, people were drinking, but no one was doing any drugs. - So kids were drinking alcohol? Her mother let them have alcohol at the party? She can go to jail for that. - Her mother wasn't at the party. Mom, it's my fault. I begged Dad to let me go to that party. I thought it would be a good opportunity to meet everyone. - Well, you should've left the moment that you knew they were drinking. - Right, so just get up and leave? - Yes. - Exactly. - It's not as easy as you think. - Hey. - Did you see the news? - You mean about Jake? - Yep, he had GHB in his system. - Yeah, I saw that. - You know it was Lexi. And she could've done that to any one of us. - Do you think she's done it before? - Definitely, I've been to other parties where I've seen guys acting completely out of it. I mean, we just assumed that they were drunk, but what if she dropped something in their drinks, too? - This is awful. It's just too much to take in. I move here, I try to make new friends, and now I'm in the middle of a police investigation. - I just think you shouldn't say anything and stay out of it. - No, I can't do that. I need to tell the police what I saw and heard. - Well, what'd you see? - I mean, I saw something suspicious, but maybe I'm just being paranoid. - Well, if you didn't see her put the GHB in his drink, then I don't think you should say anything. - Yeah, I guess you're right. - Well, it's late. Why don't you get some sleep and I'll pick you up in the morning? School's going to be very interesting tomorrow. - Sounds good. - In the meantime, I'll put some feelers out and see if I can find out who sold her the GHB. - You know those kinds of people? - Yeah, of course, we all do. - Sierra! - My mom is calling me, I should probably go. - Okay, yeah, sounds good. - Lance? - Yeah? - Thanks. - For what? - For watchin' out for me, for caring, for being a nice guy. Well, I'll see you in the morning. - Yeah, yeah, yeah, sounds good. - Bye. - Bye. Lexi, how did you get in here? - You think I'm guilty, don't you? - No, no, I don't. - Yes, you do, just admit it! - Please, Lexi, I didn't see anything. I don't even know what you're talking about. - Do you think I drugged Jake? Do you think it's my fault that he drowned? - No, no, I don't think you would ever do something like that. - Well, you're wrong. I did kill Jake and I'm gonna kill you, too! No, I'm gonna be late. I'm so tired. - Me, too, late nights. - I haven't been sleeping a lot lately. - It's this whole GHB thing. - Yeah, I'm having weird dreams, too. - It's exhausting. - They're back. - Well, they'll be here until they find out who gave Jake the GHB. - Did you figure it out? - I'm actually getting closer. I'm pretty certain that it's a kid that got expelled last year. She definitely knew him. - The kid drowned, it's not my fault. - Lexi, it is your fault. You had a party at the house without me there. - Looks like there's trouble in paradise. - It's time for you to go live with your dad. Let him take care of you, I'm done. - Mom, he doesn't want me either. - Come on, we don't wanna be late for school. - We appreciate you comin' to the school today. You know, as you know... - Did I have a choice? - Ma'am, a student from this high school died in your pool with drugs and alcohol in his system. - I wasn't even there. I didn't know that my daughter was gonna throw a party while I was gone. - Really, Mother? Now you're going to throw me under the bus? - What am I supposed to do? Go to prison for one of your idiotic decisions? - No, but I would think that my mother would... - That your mother would what? Save your ass time and time again? I'm tired of it, Lexi. You're a big girl now. Time for you to start paying for your own mistakes. - Well, actually, ma'am, your daughter's under 18. So, unfortunately, the responsibility falls with you. In fact, once this homicide investigation is complete, you will most likely be charged with serving alcohol to minors. - I'm not answering any more of your questions until my lawyer's present. - Mrs. Cooper, don't you have any compassion for the young man and his family? - I'm done here. If you're gonna press charges, then press charges. But if you don't have anything, then leave me alone. And feel free to interview my daughter. I give you permission. - Mother! - Good bye, Lexi. - Can I go now? - Not yet. Answer the question. Were minors drinking or doing drugs at the party? - Sure, I saw kids drinking beer and hard stuff, but I didn't see any drugs. - Come on. You're telling me that there were no drugs at that party? - I swear to you. No one was even smoking a joint. - Do you use drugs? - No, I don't use drugs. My parents would kill me if I did any drugs. - And you didn't see anyone giving Jake GHB? - No, I mean, I wouldn't know if someone did. I don't even know what GHB looks like. - Okay. You can go now. Thank you for your honesty. - Sure. - All right, move, move! Hustle, run, run! - It's not even due 'til tomorrow. It's crazy. - What the hell are they trying to solve? A kid did some drugs and drowned. - He didn't just drown. - What do you mean? - Someone gave him that GHB. - Kaitlyn, come on. We don't have time for Nancy Drew. - Why would anyone wanna kill Jake? - Did you have something to do with it? - No, how dare you accuse me of that! - Lexi, what are you doing? - I'm trying to get to the truth. - Are you trying to cover for something that you did? I knew you were up to something that night. I saw you. Is that what this is about? - Whoa, you just need to chill out. There are way too many conspiracy theories going around. Maybe Jake was just stoned out of his mind when he walked into that pool. Maybe he just wanted to kill himself in front of the entire school. What do you think of that, new girl? - Stop calling me the new girl. - You are, aren't you, new girl? - Stop calling me that right now. - Or what, what are ya gonna do about it, new girl? - Stop that! - Come on, troublemaker. - Lexi, stop! This is getting way out of hand. - Why should I? - Stop this now, Lexi. - No! I had nothing to do with it. It was her. She must've dropped something in his drink. They were pulling a prank on Jake. I mean, maybe they didn't mean to kill him, but they did. - Keep talkin', Sierra. No one's going to believe that. But they'll believe that you did it because you had a motive. - Why would I ever do such a thing? - Look, poor little Colorado is crying. - Who the hell do you think you are? - How dare you even put one hand on me, you bitch! - How dare you accuse me of something so heinous, especially when you did it! You know you did. - Lexi! - Hey, hey, hey, hey! Hey, what the hell are you doing? - Go to hell, Lance! - Get outta here. - Come on, Lexi. - Nobody likes you. Yeah, you, too, Kaitlyn. - What were you thinking? - What? Don't you have class to go to? Get outta here! Hey, hey. - I think I'm gonna throw up. - Hey, don't worry, don't worry. Everything will be okay. - You promise? - Scout's honor. - Everyone out of the building, Dan, Andy! Andy, come on, catch up with the students. This is not a drill. Come on, let's do everything that we practice, and we'll be okay. Mary, come on, this is not a drill. Move, move, we'll catch up with the students. Let's go. Let's go quickly. Let's go quickly, young people. Let's move it. Let's go, come on. Move, go, go, go, go. The fire department is going to be here shortly and if you follow the drill the way that we have practiced, there will be no problems. Come on, let's move quickly. Follow the drill as practiced. Hello, I appreciate the three of you coming in to speak with us here. I understand a lot has been happening as you've moved into your new home, but we have something very important that we need to discuss with the three of you. - I know that look. What's going on? - We got an anonymous tip and we checked Sierra's locker, and we found this. - What is it? - It's GHB. - GHB? No, it can't be. Someone must've put it there. - Wait, wait, I don't understand. Sierra, what is going on? - That's not mine. Why would I have this stuff in my locker. - Ms. Wilkins, our daughter does not do drugs. - Sir, we've just found drugs in your daughter's locker. What am I supposed to believe? - Sierra, you need to give us more information so we can help you. - Well, someone must've planted it there. - You think someone got your combination and stuffed it in your locker to set you up? - Yes, I do. My God, I bet it was Lexi. - Why would she do that? - Well, she's trying to set me up to take the fall for Jake's death. She was the one who gave it to him. - Well, you saw her give it to him. - Not exactly, but I... - Sierra. If you have no evidence, you can't just accuse someone. - Of course, I can. - Are you sure about that? Or did you offer to hold the GHB for someone without knowing what it was? That happens all the time. Your father and I would completely understand if that's what happened. - My God, I had nothing to do with Jake's death. This is a setup. Why don't you guys believe me? - Sweetie, we believe you, but... - I told you it's not mine and that I had nothing to do with it. - Okay, well, unfortunately, I have no other choice but to suspend Sierra pending further investigation. - I've had enough. - Sierra, you just can't up and leave. Sierra, Sierra, this is a very serious matter! - Thanks for the ride. - Hey, hey, aren't ya gonna say good bye? - I'm sorry. I'm just freaking out over what my parents are gonna do. You should've seen the look on their faces when I left that meeting. - Well, I'm still looking for the drug dealer and I'm here to help you. Whatever you need me to do, I'm yours. - Thanks, you're sweet. That bitch is watching us. - Those girls are up to something. Hey, hey, hey, hey! What are ya gonna do? - I don't know. But I'm not gonna take the fall for Jake's death. - Well, I won't let that happen to you. - Thanks. Bye. Open up! I know you're in there, I saw you in the window! - Dammit. - Open the door! - I've got it. - Open the door! - Shh! - How the hell did a bottle of GHB get in my locker? - I don't know what you're talking about. - You know exactly what I'm talking about. - No, I don't. - You guys put GHB in my locker. - You guys? I don't know anything about it. - Come on, Kaitlyn. I'm not stupid. I know Lexi tells you everything. - No, she doesn't. And I don't know anything about any GHB. - I don't believe you. - You don't have to. In fact, I really don't care. - Hey, where are you going? - I'm gonna go tell Lexi that you accused me of putting GHB in your locker. - No, don't do that! - Why not? - Because. - Because it's yours and you're blaming us for it? - What? My God, you girls are seriously messed up around here. - Then, why don't you go back to Colorado. - Hey, wait! Maybe I will, but not until I get Lexi to confess. I'm so sorry, Mom. - Honey, you don't have to apologize. We know it wasn't you. We believe you, sweetheart. - You do? - Yes, they know nothing about you. And it wasn't fair for the detectives and the principal to corner you like that. - Thank you, Mom and Dad. I love you guys. - We love you so much. - And we'll figure this out together, okay? - Come on, you must be exhausted. - Why the hell did they let her run outta school? Why didn't they arrest her? - Because they obviously have doubts about her guilt. - Why is that? - Because she didn't do it. - Well, I didn't kill him. - Shh, your mom might be home. - Do you actually think she's home? She's out drunk somewhere. - Well, you put the GHB in his drink. - So what? - That's manslaughter, Lexi. You don't get it, do you? Look, Jake died because your prank went awry. - He died because he drowned. - Stop kidding yourself. He only drowned because you put the GHB in his drink. - Well, I didn't do it, Kaitlyn. Sierra did it. - So, you've convinced yourself that your own lies are real? - It is now the new truth. Why do you think I put the GHB in her locker? - I have an idea. We should call Sierra and meet up with her. - Why would we do that? - Because we need a pact between the three of us. Look, we all need to be on the same page. It's the only way to make sure that none of us goes to jail. - Yes. You're right. We need to make sure that Sierra keeps her mouth shut. None of us should ever speak about it ever again. The police will never find out it was us if we refuse to talk about it. - Right. - Okay, set it up. - Why are you calling me? - Listen, things are getting out of control. I mean, at this point, all three of us can go to jail. - She's brainwashed you, hasn't she? - No, I can think for myself. - No, you can't. She did it, we had nothing to do with it. She should go to jail. - Please, Sierra, just think straight. Look, just meet with us, okay? We need to make a pact. We need to all agree to never talk about this again. If we don't, we'll all three go to jail. - I am not going to jail. - Yes, you will. Lexi always gets what she wants. If she wants you in jail, she'll make sure you take the fall. - She's disgusting. - Yeah, she is. But there's nothing I can do. I mean, she's like a freight train that can't be stopped. Look, the only way is for all three of us to agree to never talk about this again. They can't prove where the GHB came from if we don't talk. Please, Sierra? Look, I'm scared. This is my only chance. And if we don't meet, she'll take me down, too. - How do we believe her? - She's desperate. I mean, I've never seen her like this before. - Well, why do we have to meet up? Can't we just agree right now? - She needs to see your face. I mean, she needs to be sure that you're not gonna say anything. - Where are we meeting? - Let's meet at the furthest south point of Lake Sherwood tonight at midnight. I'll send you a pin. - Fine, I'll be there. - And don't bring your boyfriend. - Don't worry. This will all be over tonight. Don't worry, Sierra. We're all friends here, aren't we? Okay, let's get down to business. All three of us can go to jail for Jake's death if anyone finds out we gave him the GHB. - You gave him the GHB. At least admit to it already. It's only the three of us here. - Okay, fine, it was me! Are you happy now? But you were there. You could've stopped me, but you didn't. - I didn't know what you were doing. - You saw me give him the GHB. You knew exactly what I was going to do with it. You knew it was a prank and you thought it was funny. - No, no, I didn't. I didn't see anything so... - Yes, you did! - Stop, okay, just stop. Look, that was the past. Let's just talk about why we're here. - Fine, Kaitlyn and I agree that best strategy is if we all agree to never talk about it. Don't speak to the police again, never admit to anything, and never throw either of us under the bus. - And you think that'll stop the police from pointing the finger at us? - Yes, I do. They can't prove that I put that drug in his drink. And they can't prove that it was my GHB or your GHB. - Yeah, nice trick putting that GHB in my locker. - What can I say? I needed some insurance. - Well, it worked. - We know all about your troubles back in Denver. Pushing that poor girl over causing her to crack her skull. Sounds like you have some anger issues you needed to take control of. - It was an accident. - Sure, it was. And that's why your parents are paying her off, right? What are you up to? What's your plan this time? - I don't have a plan. - Well, you can't pay me off. - Stop! - Stop. Stop! - Stop. - What is that? - It's a cellphone. - Get off. - It's my phone. - Give it to me! - Let go! - Get off! - Stop! It's her cellphone. - There's a microphone app on it. Were you recording me? - No, I wasn't. - You were gonna turn this in to the police. I came here to make a truce and your intention was to set me up? - A truce? Why would I make a truce when I did nothing? - Where are you going? - I gave you a chance to get out of this, but you set me up! Where are you going? - I'm getting out of here. - What do you think you're doing? You need to help me with the body. - What do you mean? - If you don't, we'll both go to jail for killing Jake and Sierra. - My God. My God. - Would you shut up already? Stop freaking out. - How can I stop freaking out when my life is completely over now? - Your life will be completely over if you don't help me put her in her car now. Come on, grab her legs and I'll grab her arms. - Is she dead? - No, she's still alive. But you grab one arm and I'll grab the other. Okay, legs. Okay, okay, pull her up. All right. Okay. - What are you doing? - I'm helping our friend commit suicide. - Are you crazy? - You're a part of this now. Do as I say, all right? Go to the back and start pushing. Okay, one, two, three. Keep pushing! Push! - It's heavy. - Push. You better keep your mouth shut unless you wanna commit suicide, too. Are you coming? Now, let it go. - Sierra, Sierra, wake up! It's 7:30, you're gonna be late. - Melissa, your car's gone. - What? - Where's Sierra? - Sierra. - Dammit. - Hey, it's Sierra. Leave a message and I'll call you back. - Sierra, where are you? Call me immediately. Where is she? - I don't know. It's okay, it's okay. Come on, let's go. - Okay. - Lexi, where are you? Lexi? - Yes, Mother? - Don't, "Yes, Mother," me. - What's wrong? - Did you put drugs in that boy's drink? - No, I told you that I didn't. Don't you believe me? - No, no, I don't. The detectives just called me. They're pressing charges against me for serving alcohol to minors. - That's ridiculous. - No. No, no, you're ridiculous and I want you out of this house. - What, Mother? You're acting irrational. - No, no, no, no. I am perfectly lucid. As a matter of fact, I haven't thought this clearly for a really long time. You're gonna be 18 in a few weeks. I'm done. I don't have to take care of you anymore. - That's funny, Mother. When did you ever take care of me? I have been taking care of you since I was 10 years old. - Say whatever you want. I want you out of this house by tonight. - Sure, Mom, I think that's what's best for the both of us. I'll just go grab some things. - Good, I'm glad you're thinking clearly now. - Good bye, Mother. Daddy always told you to be careful on the stairs. - Honey, where is she? - I don't know. - My God, where are we? - In the middle of nowhere. What the hell is she doing out here? - I don't know. Where is this? Where are we? - Hey, look at me. Look at me. It's gonna be fine. We're gonna find her, okay? - Let's check your app. - Give it to me. - What's it say? - Okay, we're still a little ways out, but we're heading in the right direction. It says she's right here. Hang on. - Sierra! - Sierra! - Sierra! My God, Jeremy, my car! My God, Sierra! - Sierra, answer me! - Sierra! - No. - What is it? - No, no, no, no, no, no, no. - My God. Sierra! - Sierra! - Sierra! - Sierra! - Mom? Mom! Dad! - Sierra, where are you? - Mom, I'm down here. - Give me your hand. Give me your hand. - Baby, we're coming. Honey, are you okay? - My God. - Baby. - How did you find me? - That app you don't like me using, that's how. - Honey, what happened? - Lexi, she hit my head. - My God. My God. - Okay, baby, I'm gonna lift you up nice and slow. - Yeah, come on, baby. - Here we go. - Let's get outta here. - Here we go now. Yeah, nice and easy. - Come on. - Nice and easy. I got ya, I got ya. - My head really hurts. - All right, just nice and easy, sweetheart. - Miss Hanson, to reception area, please. Miss Hanson. - You've got a hard head, young lady. You're very lucky that she didn't crack your skull. - Feels like she did. She definitely hit at least a triple. - Well, if she hit a home run, we probably wouldn't be talking right now. - Okay, enough with the baseball analogies. Is she gonna be all right? - She will be fine as long as she takes it easy for the next two weeks. It's definitely a concussion. The brain needs time to repair itself. - But can I go home? - We'll have to run a few tests on you first. But as long as they come back clear, we'll be able to release you, 'kay? - You almost died, Sierra. We're gonna do exactly what the doctor orders, okay? - Got it. Thank you, doctor. - Sure thing. - Thank you. - Absolutely. - Thank God you're okay, baby. - What about Lexi? - Hey, I don't care about her right now. - She might come back for me if she finds out I survived. - Hey, you'll be safe here. The police are out searching for her. She should be in their custody in no time, okay? - Okay. - It's gonna be okay, okay? - It looked like an accident, but she could've easily been pushed by her daughter. - We need initials here to secure the scene. - Yes, 12-AL79 need clearance. Female, 81, up there on Cloud Drive. - What's up, Tanner? - Lance? You lookin' for some goods? - No, I'm looking for some information. - Information ain't free. - Lexi Cooper, she buy GHB from you? - Now, why would I tell you that? - Because she gave it to Jake, and Jake was your friend. - I knew I couldn't trust her. She bought it right before her party. - What'd you think she was gonna do with it? - I don't ask questions. - Well, maybe you should because now Jake's dead. - Well, it ain't my fault. - Maybe it is. - Sure, yeah, whatever you say. tthole! - Way to go, KC. - Forget about it, go long! - Kaitlyn! - Down to go. We came here for football, let's go! - What's wrong, why are you backing away from me? - You know exactly why. - No, I don't. Why don't you tell me. Tell me, Kaitlyn, why are you walking away from me? We're in this together! What are you gonna do? Call the police? - You don't belong there! - Or did you already? - Maybe. - Now, why would you do a thing like that? - Look, this has to end now. - It is over, Sierra is dead. Why are you so worried? - My God. You don't know, do you? - Don't know what? - Sierra isn't dead. Her car didn't sink entirely. She got out, she's alive. She's in the hospital, you screwed up. And now she probably told the police that we tried to kill... - You're lying! You're making it all up. How could you know she's alive? - Duh, genius, 'cause my father works at the hospital. He told me. - So now you're going to the police. - What else can I do? - So now meek, little Kaitlyn has grown some balls. - I guess you could say that. I think it's time Kaitlyn starts looking after Kaitlyn. I've followed you and I've saved your butt almost my entire life. Well, I'm done. - Yes, you are done. - What's that supposed to mean? Get the hell off me. - I am not going to jail. - Lexi, please, stop! - Hey, what's going on over there? Lexi, what are you doing? - You're lucky. I was going to kill you. Now, if you don't keep your mouth shut, I will next time and it won't be as pleasant as this was. - What'd she say? - Are you okay? Are you good? - I'm fine. I'm fine. - Kaitlyn, where are you going? Are you okay? - Should we chase her? - Damn, man,. - Throw me the ball. - Let's play ball. - I can't stress enough. You're daughter's very lucky and should be fine. - Well, thank you. So just to review, bed rest for the first couple days? - Absolutely, I would avoid any strenuous exercise. Try to avoid extended periods of direct sun, okay? - Okay. - All right. Other than that, I will see you folks in one week's time. - Thank you, doctor. - Absolutely. - Thank you so much. - Absolutely. Best of luck, all right? - Let's get outta here. - Yes. - I'll come around to you, okay? - Thanks, Dad. - Wait, Sierra, let me help you. - My head. - You okay? Yeah? - Yeah. - They placed a police officer in front of our house. - In case she comes here to kill me? - Hey, just take it easy? - Thank you. I love you both. - We love you so much. Come here. - Come on, let's get you inside. - Hey, honey, you have a visitor. - Hey. - Hi. - All right, I'll let you two have some privacy. I heard they tried to kill you. - How did you hear that? - From Kaitlyn. Lexi almost killed her, too, but the football team stopped her and she got away. - Well, Kaitlyn's no saint either. They're both gonna go to jail for a very long time. - Yeah, and I already told the police who sold her the GHB. She's toast. - I knew you'd find the dealer. - So why didn't you call me for help? - I thought I could handle it on my own. - Well, that was very dangerous. But impressive. - You think? - I know. Get some rest. I'll see you in the morning. - 911, what is your emergency? - Yes, I have an emergency. There's someone in my house. He's downstairs, he has a gun. Please, come fast. - You're on a cellphone. What's your address? - 18555 Veloz Avenue, Calabasas. Please, come quickly! - Units are on the way. - There's a report of an intruder in your vicinity at 18555 Veloz Avenue. Are you able to respond? - Copy, that's just right around the corner. I can check it out. But can you send backup to relieve me once I'm there, over? - Units are in route. - You poor thing. Let's change this. Sorry, honey. - What was that? - You guys hear that? What's goin' on? - Yeah, we did. What's happening, Jeremy? - Why'd the cop leave? - Sierra! - Jeremy, who is that? - She's here, it's her. It's Lexi! - We don't know that. - Open up, Sierra, we have some unfinished business. Open up! - My God. - Mom. - I know you're all home. Mr. Reynolds, Mrs. Reynolds, I would really appreciate it if I could have a conversation with your daughter. - She's trying to kill me, she's insane. - What are we gonna do? - Keep your voices down, call the police, and no matter what you do, do not open this door, do you understand me? - Jeremy, be careful. - Dad. - I'm waiting. - What do you want, Lexi? - I want your daughter to confess what she did. - She didn't do anything. - We made a pact. We all agreed never to talk about it anymore. But your daughter broke that pact. Sierra, the most important thing you have in this life is your word. That's it, it's all about trust. Do you remember when we first met? I thought I could trust you, but I was wrong. - Lexi, the police are on their way. Just put down the gun, please. - Shut up, Jeremy. I'm not interested in talking to you. Now tell your daughter to come out of her room, now! - Sierra's not coming out. We'll just wait here for the police to show up. - The cops aren't going to show up. I sent 'em away. - Lexi! - Okay, I'm done waiting. Sierra, if you don't come outta your room now, I'm going to kill you. - No, no, you're not going out there. Your dad'll handle it. Sierra, what are you doing? - We have to get out of here. - We're not going that way, it's way too dangerous. - I have a plan. - Shh, she's gonna hear us. What are you doing, Sierra! - You're not getting away this time. - Sierra, she's coming! - Sierra! I know you're in here. Dammit! Dammit! You can run, but I will find you. - My God, is she dead? - I don't know. - I'll call the police. Come on, let's get Dad. - Dad! - My God! Jeremy, are you all right? - Little bitch shot me! God, you guys okay? - Yeah, yeah. - Thank you so much for the party. Of course. - Sierra. - Look who's here. - Aw. - These are for you. - They're so beautiful. Thank you. I'm so sorry. I hugged you too hard. - No worries, I'm still a little sore, but I'll be okay. - Good. Well, everybody's waiting. - Come on, guys! - You ready to have some fun? - This way. - Hey, you guys! - Hey, dude, what's up? - Hey! - What's up, guys? - Hi. - Hey, Erin. - Yo! - The only... - Get away from this, come on. - Hey, I heard there was a new girl. - Hey, girls, hey. - Come on. - Check out the new girl. - Don't look much. - Yeah,. - Initiation maybe? - We're gonna have fun with her.
