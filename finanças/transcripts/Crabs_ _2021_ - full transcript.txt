Oh. Oh, why are you stopping? Keep it going. Keep it going. - Wait! No, wait! - Keep it going. - Hold on. Sequoia, wait. - Ah. - What? - What is that thing? Uh... groovy little crab. Well, let him watch if he wants. Whatever floats your boat, little dude. - Yeah, you know... - Ah, what the fuck? Yeah, yeah. - That's disgusting. - Don't freak out. It's dead. Babe, you gotta take a picture with this. - No, I don't want to touch it. - Come on. Just do it. Hmm... - Fine. - Yeah. - Just be quick. - Okay. Ugh. Wait for a second. - Okay, okay, okay. - Come on. Babe, you better put that down. Ah, babe. Come on, babe. Babe. Hon, are you okay? Babe? I'm sorry. Hey, watch it. You are the fucking kids. Oh, come on! Come on. Fuck you, you little crab. Sucker! Ha-ha! Oh, no, no, no shit. Hey, Deputy. Put your damn game down and dig up over. - Sheriff, I'm here. - I'm about to swing by Johnny B's and pick your brother up. - Do you want anything? - Same for me. Hey, Mr. West? Hey, Mr. West. Oh, no, Mr. West. Oh, not again. Damn it! Mr. West, I did a breakfast burrito. Please slow down. Damn it, Hunter! Maddy, would you mind taking that down? Thank you. De nada. Hay, Maddy... ...remember that thing I was telling you about? Yes, is that it? Ah! Do you want to try it out? - Let's do it. - Good. This changes everything, Maddy. All my effort is finally going to pay off. - Our effort. - You know, that's what I meant. - Do you really think it'll work? - It better. I had to convince Flannigan to bribe four customs agents just to get it into the country. - Uh... really? - Oh, yeah. See what's in this box could theoretically fuel a military grade giant robot, ten stories tall for weeks. Phil, just in case it doesn't work. You know, life will go on either way. Right? - Whether you're able to walk... - It'll work. - Trust me. - I do. I'm just saying. Don't forget, you always have two left feet. - Hey, Maddy. Would you mind, um... - Oh. You want them? - Yeah. - You want them? - Yes. - Then stand up and get them. That's not cool. - Thanks. - No, problemo. It does see a shit in here, Phil. Yeah, it's a barn. I hope you're ready for this. Oh. Get this. It is only mapped to my thumbprint. - Whoa. - There we go. Wow. All right. Oh. Amorium Clustergram. In all of her beauty. Ready? Okay. Yeah! - Bloody Barton Jesus! - Flannigan. What the hell was that, Phil? Damn near blew my nuts off. - Not like you get much use out of them anymore. - Yeah, now, it's that's a nice thank you for me bringing you supper. - Oh, thanks. - Hi, Flannigan. Maddy, man, you're not encouraging him now, are you? Says the man who helped him procure the damn thing. - Is that what that was? - Maybe. Hey, how come why don't we just use your old man's shop instead of holding yourself up in your little cubby, huh? I have everything I need in my cubby. Well, I'm just saying it's a shame to let all that stuff go unused. Doesn't matter. Hunter's gonna sell it all anyway. You might ought a patch that hole up though before your brother gets back. Oh, you're fucked. Howdy, partner? Sheriff. Phil, will you quit ripping up the damn signs? I'm not. You're not? Then who is? - Maddy. - Hey, you told me to. You know, we can't afford to keep this place. Take it easy, Deputy. - Yeah. - All available units. We have a 19-243 down on Lunar Beach. What? A 19-243? That's a cat in a tree. Marjorie, we've talked about this. Nobody else is on these channels. So stop using the freaking codes. Ain't got time for it. Sorry, Sheriff. A dead whale washed up with a nasty slice in its belly. Bunch of folks called it and they all freaked out. Cat in the tree, huh? - Let's roll that, Deputy! - Phil, please go hang this up. You okay? Yeah, I am okay. See you tomorrow. Sure. Not like we had plans or anything. That is one big ass dead mother fucking whale. Smells like fresh asshole, too. All right. Sure as hell wasn't no shark done that. Yeah, I'm guessing not. Giant squid, maybe. Those aren't real. Are they? How the fuck would I know? Look like a guy who knows jack about fish. Fish sticks maybe. I've been working out. I'm gonna poke it with a stick. - Hey, don't be poking it with the stick. - It's a scientific observation. - I saw it in the movie. - Don't be poking and shit. - You know what I think did it? - What? Aliens... ...for sure. The truth is... ...something's out there. That's for damn sure. - This thing stinks. - Let's get out of here. - Yeah, I'll buy you some fish sticks for lunch. - No. Yeah? - It's me. - Don't come in. I'm jerking off. Shut up, I am coming in. Can I help you? - Breakfast pizza? - Gross. So, dude, uh, what the hell happened to the door? I don't know what you're talking about. Don't be difficult. Just fix it, Okay? Right. Good talk, Phil. Ugh. Um, that is gross. Well. - What's up? It's late. - Hey, Maddy. - I'm sorry I got... - Yeah, yeah, yeah, whatever. My only demand is unquestionable rights to the movie choice next week. - Okay, but I refused to watch... - Uh-uh, no, no, no. No exceptions. Fine. You know, you can wait for me at the top, - like, I can do this myself. - Hmm. Pushing your lazy ass around is the only workout I can handle. Seriously, fuck running. Next. Next. No heads-up this morning? Oh, hey, we're going to be playing with dead things today. Maybe don't wear your favorite shirt. No? - Thanks, Mom. - Have fun. All right. Now everyone has one specimen for group, right? If you look at the diagram in your lab packet, you'll see the instructions... It's a... a mighty fine pussy you got there. - Ew! - I am so sorry. That was... That was awful. Oh, please be careful with the scalpel and make sure you pin down the... Oh, Radu. I thought you were going to warn me next time. I, I am sorry, Miss Menrath, but these things, I mean, I cannot. The, the garbage is three feet away. You used to think he was cute. Aw. Is someone feeling jealous? Well, you know where the health office is. Come on. Leave it. Feel better, all right. Thanks, Mindy. What's going over here? Fine, Mom. Go away! Hush, daughter. Maybe I wanted to talk to McCalister. Oh, if this is about the Geiger counter incident, I... Oh, no, no, no. I see that you didn't sign the registration sheet for the dance yet. - And I know Maddy doesn't... - Mama. Ferme la bouche. Seriously, go away. Alright, Fine. Get over yourself. What up, Filibuster? I got to ask you something. Good after lunch time, my classmates Philip. - Hi, Radu. - Hey! Good after lunchtime to you too Madeleine. I am have begging your pardon, but Radu is in this time not having a lady partner for the disco evening in days coming, uh, Radu have asked many of my classmates and have many female classmates said to Radu, "No way." Thanks, Radu. But I already have a date. - You do? - Yes, you. But he cannot walk. Uh... but then serious, this fellow cannot for the life of him, this go simple, hokey-pokey. You'd be surprised. You smell like a mermaid. America. This is super fucked up. Stop messing with the evidence, Deputy. I was just... Sorry, sir. Well... ...goes that way. Shall we? What do you think could've done it? Well... - I think it's a seal. - A what? - A seal. - If it was a seal, there'd be flapper tracks. Yeah. I guess that's right. Maybe covered them up, though. I hear they're highly intelligent. Ever heard of a man eating seal? Don't rule it out. I heard they can be vicious, man. Think again, dumb ass. Okay. All right, fine. I'll drop this. Watch your step. - Tide hasn't washed away the blood yet. - Yeah. All right, then... ...get on up in there. I'll cover you from back here. Fine. Ah. Fuck! What the fuck? Oh, God. What the fuck is this? Excuse me. Miss? Miss, you all right? Miss. Excuse me, Miss. Crabs! Crabs. Sheriff? Sheriff? And then his mother shook the goat and said to Radu, "Radu, now you must clean father's dirty hole." Can friends guess what Radu do after this? What the fuck you talking about, dude? The question I was asking is what do Radu do and choose after his mother said to Radu, "Radu, you put the goat back in the goat house. Are you cleaning the dirty hole of the father?" - Dude, why do we invite him? - Come on. He's funny. Ew. - Shrooms? - Sweets? - Something like that. - Here. Oh, my boy, my boy. - What was that? - Do not be afraid. His only badger, Radu, good fight. He's not badger. Holy fuck. Mommy! Hey, Maddy, come on in. Door's open. - Hey, Phil. - Uh. Hey, I'll, I'll fix the door tomorrow. Whoa. Did you build all these? Yes, I did. - What you're working on? - The same old stuff. Can I see? Problem with my last iteration was that I neglected to take into account the increase in power consumption when I changed out the radio carbine undulator with the new Kanako brand. Lux pistons that I got from that Korean website. But then I got this. A fancy D battery. Hey! Whoa. That's like comparing a firework to an atom bomb. Now this it's the Amorium Clustergram, piece of tech way ahead of its time. This thing can rapidly convert joules of energy into bit fueled streams of particles. Phil, you know I don't speak nerd. English. Please. Careful. Grab the legs. - Okay. - Okay. Yeah. Now that... Nice and tight, Nice and tight. - Hunter, that's not my leg. - Oh, I'm sorry. - Now what? - Uh, well, pass me the Amorium Clustergram The shiny dude. Oh, yeah, it's... Yeah. Okay. - You know the hole in the door? - Yeah. Yeah, I would take a step back. - Aah... - This shit is for real. Phil, you know, maybe we shouldn't... - Seriously, Phil. Just stop, okay? - And to right... Oh, God. Careful. Are you okay, Phil? - I'm good. Good. - Here, let me here... - No. Don't. I need to do it myself. - Okay. Okay. - Can I, can I just help? - No, just... Oh, my God. - Phil! - It's working. - I can't believe it. - Easy, okay, okay. Baby steps, baby steps, baby steps -I am walking. I'm walking. Phil! - Calm down. - Stop. Fuck. - Stop. - Fine. Okay, okay. Fine, I'm sorry. Hey, come on. At least you didn't blow your leg off. Phil, come back. Philip. Philip? Where's he going? - I don't know. - I'll be right back. - We'll be here. - -Phil, hey, Phil, wait up! Deputy... everything under control? - Obviously. - Sorry, this was a bad time. She told me that she borrowed his English notebook or something. Yeah. I think it was an excuse just to come by. Ah. Hormones and all of that. Yeah. They might be gone a while. I just, um... ...if you, if you want to come inside. - Why not? - Yeah? - Yeah. - O... okay. Um... Watch your step. Make yourself at home. Do you want a beer? I am fine with this if you are. Um, yes. Very much so. - This is wild. - What is it? I just never thought I would be getting high with one of my old teachers. - Old? - No, I didn't, I didn't mean like that. I just mean like... I never thought you'd end up being a cop. What's that supposed to mean? Nothing. I just... You always seemed a bit too... open minded. At least to get stuck around here. I'm not stuck. Everyone's still here is stuck. I'm guessing these aren't yours. Uh, no. Those are my dad's. Phil's read them although, so they might as well be his now. "The molecular response to non-dimensional... ...tubular optics and their effect on postmodern orbital theories." I knew he was smart, but damn... Is this... Oh, let's... Let's not... This is from when you graduated, right? Oh, my God. I remember how pissed they were. - It's got to be in here. - I really hope it's not. It has to be in here somewhere here. Oh. Oh, my God. It's better than I remembered. Does young and stupid count as a good excuse? - If you ignore my nerd glasses... - Oh, yeah, um, I don't think that's this year. No, it... Oh. - Did someone have a little crush on teacher? - F... whatever. Bobby Lutz drew that. So, like, whatever... Liar. Oh, um... I don't want my daughter to smell the weed on you, so let's, uh, go for a walk? Yes. Um... yeah, okay. Dude, wait up. Fuck! Let it out. Fuck. Cock. I'm sorry. I'm just in a really shitty mood. Wait. Really? I couldn't tell. Shut up. - Do you want me to leave you alone? - No. I am okay. Do you want to go watch homeless people have sex on the beach? I guess. All right, Then come on, Debbie Downer. Our friends is food for the ocean demon. What the fuck did he just say? I says American children is yum-yum for the... - Are you all right? - Please I is needing of alcohol. - How old are you? - Radu? No, Radu is twenty-one years of age. - Legal drinking for the United States government. - I smell a lie. I smell you was dirty poop hole. Bullshit. Get the hell out of my bar - before I call the sheriff. - Yes. Yes, call the law enforcement, please. Yes. Man, don't make me get up and kick your ass. - Yeah, okay. Okay. - You need to leave. All right. Be it so. But if Radu die tonight, the blood of Radu is on your wet hands. - Wet Radu blood. - Get out. Get the fuck out of here. Boy, we get all kinds, huh? Curse you. Curse you and your many children. Hey! What was that? Did you try adding a defibrillating layer to the inner knee shock module? The legs keep breaking around the inception point anchor. - I don't think adding it... - Exactly. The defib would help control the force output and stop the Clustergram from overloading. - Would that really work? - Yeah, I'm genius. Remember? Fuck. Thank God, you Jesus fuckers. We are needing to be running. Radu is flesh from attack. Listen to Radu and do this shit, okay? 'Cause we are about to go poofed out. - Wait. What? - Call number for American Imperial Forces. - Who is attacking you? - Piss off, Radu. Don't encourage him. Shut your dirty chair face. I am trying to help you right now. I run to you. I give you a tip and you tell me to piss off. Why people say to piss off to Radu? I warned about the ocean Demon and, no, "Just piss off, Radu." Radu is sick of America. We are going to die. It's kind of cute. - Monster that eats skin is cute? - Hey, Maddy, please be careful. Guys, come check this out. I can taste clouds. Hey there, little guy. What exactly are you? Oh, your face is about to go. Bye-bye. - Well, poor thing is injured. - Kill it with fire. - Kill it. - You guys are scaring it. Fucking kill it. Don't be afraid. Game over. Radu? I'm not gonna hurt you. There you go. Come on. Come on. Madeline, slaughter are your demons. She has the magic thoughts. When this shit start hitting the fan, Radu is putting his last on the girl. What the hell did I just see? Radu, you should go home. I hope you find your friends. Okay, bye. Great. You want me to help from the dance? - Seriously. - Come on. It'll be really fun. Let me check my calendar. - You don't have a calendar. - Hmm. See, I think I can move - some things around and squeeze you in. - Oh, really? - Uh-oh. - Oh. Hi, sweetie cakes. Oh, Philip, are you excited about the dance? - You already told your mom? - Oh, don't read into it. - Ready, Mom? - Sure, sweaty cake. - Got lots of papers to grade. - Goodnight, Maddy. Good tonight. Good night, Mrs. Menrath. - It's Miss Menrath. - Mama, ew. - Mom. - Yeah. I need your help with something really important. What? Anything, my obnoxiously cryptic daughter. - You're freaking me out a little. - Okay. Come on. Mom, duck, don't be dumb. Don't talk to your mother like that. Don't hit your daughter like that. - Where are we going? - Shush. - Are we playing a game? - No. I think that is locked. - Oh, is it now? - Ye of little faith. - What? Honey, where did you get that key? I borrowed it. - Come on. - If I wasn't aggressively high right now, you would be grounded. - But is this a mini nuclear reactor? - Mom, don't touch that. - I... - Just don't touch anything. - Is that even legal? - Mom, we have work to do. These legs aren't gonna build themselves. You are Poseidon's mistake. Did you know that? Poseidon, he wake up every morning and he looked at you and say, "I fuck up." You know, know that Radu is ninja. You are dead and I'm a ninja. You look like my grandmother's neck. You killed my friend. Why did you do that? You have more legs than you need, you greedy piece of shit. You think you're tough because you have spine and you have the tail? You know who else have spine and tail? Bitches. Radu is warrior, and he's not afraid of you no more. Going to cut you up into little pieces. I'm going to cook you and make a stew and then throw it out because orphans don't want to eat you.

I think it's all over. They are all dead. What the fuck is that? Did it just molt? No, no, no. What the fuck is that thing? - We got to get out. - Go, go, go. Go, Phil, go. Maddy, check the doors. - The gears are locked. - It's locked. - Let's go, buddy. You're almost there. - They're malfunctioning. Hunter, they're locking up. I can't run. Phil. Let me help. - I got him. I got him. Go. - Guys, I found one. - Damn, fucking wheel. - Phil, what kind of space bumper is this? - Look out! - Shit. Hunter, just go. It's okay. - Go now! - Hunter! Damn it! Get out of here! - Don't be stupid! Run! - Get Phil! No! Hunter, no. Thanks for that. Thanks, Radu. Where'd you get the sword? Who does not have a ninja sword? - Come on. We gotta go. - Okay, come on, let's go. - Maddy, don't forget the Clustergram. - Two steps ahead of you. - Maddy, get me that chair over there. - Got it. - Here. - -I'm so glad you're not dead with the others. - Radu, what the hell is going on? - Here's to Radu. He has been on front line fighting war - mother fuck on ocean demons. - What are these things? - My guess is some unknown species of Limulidae. - What's a Limuli... like, what? Look, they're called horseshoe crabs, and they've been totally harmless for the last four hundred and fifty million years. Until today, apparently. I, I'm no expert, but I've never seen a six foot tall crab. These are more closely related to spiders or scorpions, not crabs, so... Well, I seriously doubt these things are closely related to jack or shit anymore. Can we just move on? Oh, Radu have attempt to escape. But bridge to rest of America is poof! - No more. - Miss Menrath, something's wrong. This thing is really hot. Yes, it keeps Radu nice and toasty. But arthropods are cold blooded. Exactly. And that's just the exoskeleton. - Of course. - Miss Menrath, do you still have my Geiger counter? - I was thinking the same thing. - Radu glad we are on same page. - Phil, what's a Geiger counter? - It detects and measures the amount of radiation, and it's just a hunch. But it might tell us why this thing is hot. - Oh. - Oh, shit. I'm not gonna get cancer, am I? Well, I wouldn't touch it again. No, no, no, Radu do not get cancer. Real talk. Radu now get cancer - to grow or transform... - These measurements are off the charts. - What could have caused it to be so irradiated? - Uh... These things wouldn't happen to have an uncle, would they? - Like the size of a jumbo jet? - What do you mean, Hunter? Flannigan and I found a beached whale yesterday, and it had a bite taken out of it that was huge. - Can you show us? - Uh, yes. Um... Looks like we have three different types. First, you've got the little bastards that fucked up prom. And then... Uh... This one right here just chased us down the hallway. And then there's the one that eats whales. Something like that. All the fucking no. Radu is out. - We need to call the army. - And tell them what? That we're being attacked by a man-eating crabs? Oh, and by the way, there's some giant Sea Monster - out there as well. - Yes. Perfect plan. No, they is not believing, are, are they? No, Radu, they is not believing. So what do we do? Hold on, Hunter, bring me the projector. Thank you. Okay. Um... You said these Limuli... - The damn crabs are ancient, right? - Right. Okay, let's just assume that the radiation has caused them to evolve for the first time in millions of years, that, that they are forced to adapt to a new environment, a radiated environment that would make them, uh... - Faster. - Yes. - Stronger. - Leaner. - Blue. - No. Wait. So these perfectly adapted animals are now supercharged in attacking our town. Yes. And what can stop something so jacked up? Another perfectly evolved predator. Yes, supercharged. - Oh, shit. - Everybody, head -Come on, Maddy. - Come on. Let's go. - Radu, let's go. This is not good. Mr. Norbert? What the fuck? Oh, there is them. Run! Oh, he is going to be the deadest. - So close. - -Get us safe to your home. Oh, God. We can't let this happen. We have to stop them. Oh, they see us. Go back to it, oh, that's better. - Thank you. I have to get out of here. - Mr. Beckett. Thank God, Jesus Christ and all the saints - and all the - Mr. Beckett, look out. And then I put this song out of a tree stop and the bird, bird say - "You are the king. - " -Radu, shh, I'm trying to listen. Reports are coming in. Fisherman all along the coast... - Stay in the car. - ...ocean liner sized... Phil, is this crazy plan even stand a chance? It will work if we build it together. - Trust me. - ...and can we stop them? - Okay. I trust you. - These are the questions we're still asking here at WSQK News. - Next up, Carol with the weather. - -Um... Come on. Come on. We have a lot to do and not enough time. ...raining crabs. Why are we still here? Here's the. - Thanks. Where are you going? - I need to go check on the sheriff. - But, Hunter, I... I need your help. No... ...you don't. Come on. He'll be okay. Let's get inside. Yeah. Let's do this. Radu cannot see. Where is Radu? Phil, this place is amazing. - Radu give thanks. - Yeah. Thanks. Okay. Here's what we gotta do. Oh, fuck. Pirate ship. Oh. - Radu, no, put that down. - Eh. Hell, yes. Bang, bang. You are different. Right here. Um, Phillip. - Here. - Let's try it. Just keep it there. Aren't you supposed to be a genius? Okay, I got it. - No. Uh-uh. No. - Come right off. Okay. Yeah. Unlike your legs, my hands have feeling in them, so... I have feelings. Faucet handle. Speedometer. It's looking great. Success. Much better. Radu. Propeller blade. Flotation device. Knot. CB radio. Over and out. Saw and... ...stuff. Amorium Clustergram. Hey, Flannigan, are you here, buddy? Shit. Sheriff. Oh, fuck. Fuck you, you little crab. Sherriff? Flannigan, is that you? Oh, no. What the fuck? I am sorry, buddy. I am sorry, Flannigan. Let's fucking do this. I am sorry, Miss Menrath, I, I give this to you - as the, the present. Do you know? - Thank you. This for the price of marriage for your daughter. - Oh, no, no, no, no. - It is done now. No, she needs more than a wrench. Shitty balls. What was that? Big bad crab monster? Radu know his purpose. Radu save females and little robot boy from evil. Radu, I'll be back. Most likely scenario. Hey, bottom feeders. What the fuck? No. Smarty bitch. That's everywhere. Come on. We gotta get outside. - Where is Phil? - Just go. Phil, get it now. What the fuck? Hey, turd licker. You just fucked with the wrong handicapable. Oh! Oh, no, he beat you like uncle beat the dog. Kick that crab bitch's ass! Make him your friend and then back stab him. Make him your friend and then back stab him. Back stab that bitch. - Fucking cool violent. - Come on. - Philip. - Come on. Come on. No, come on. -Come on, Philip, -It's okay. - It's going to be a okay. - Mom. Philip, Philip, set the victory out this shit hole. All right. Really? Fuck. Okay, All right. Red to yellow, um... Which damn wire is it? I can get this right. I wish Maddy was here. Okay. You think this is it? Got it. - Yes. Yes, this is a good step. - Yeah, that was awesome. All right. Come on. Come on. Where did Philip get the sword? Who doesn't have a ninja sword? She looks pissed. Oh, that's not good. So it's like that, huh? Okay. Come on. Let's play. Friends. Fuck. Fuck. Philip! Philip! Do like this! No. No. No, no, no. - Philip. Mom. - No, no, no. Be careful. I got some drawn butter in the trunk. - And now I'm hungry. - Hunter. Don't mess with my little brother, you ugly fuck! Holy shit! Oh! Yes. - Yes! Yes! - Yes! Yes! - Come on! Punch it, Philip! - Pun... punch in the tit. Punch in the tit, Philip! - Do it! - Come on, Philip. You know, I'm getting really tired of this shit. Today was shaping up to be the best day of my life. Then your ugly ass showed up. You're not going to take that away from me? Not some wheelchair, not some damn crabs. And definitely not you, piece of shit. This is my home and you can just get the fuck out. Come on. Let's go, let's go. Holly shit. You did that.
