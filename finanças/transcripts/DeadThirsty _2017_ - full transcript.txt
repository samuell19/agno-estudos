I come to this house of the people to speak to you and all Americans. Certain that we stand in a defining hour. We are Americans. Part of something larger than ourselves. And when someone has so recently endorsed Nazism it is inconceivable this extra person can legitimately inspire to leadership. Tonight, we lead the world in facing down a threat to decency. It is a big idea. A new world order, peace and security, freedom... And worthy of our children's future. Tonight, we work to achieve another victory. A victory over tyranny and savage aggression. Months after the tragic events in Ruby Ridge took three.. At the 14-year old. Stop! Prosecution of the.. Branson, just go over there. Park over there. The shooting of his dog. Investigations are ongoing as government officials review the rules of engagement that were employed in the incident. You embarrassed me. Your obsession, it ruined dinner. They shot the dog. They shot the dog and then they shot that little boy, Rachel. Who does that? Come on, that's enough. Haven't you been following the news? That stuff in the place called Ruby Ridge. The government can't come in and just do whatever they want. I mean, it's like.. Then stop it! This party is going to be off the hook. You're going to love it. All I'm saying is, it might take bloodshed. A revolution is coming if things don't change. Even on my birthday, you don't want me to have fun, can you just roll with it for just one night? That is all I'm asking. Sometimes it's like.. For one night, enough with the conspiracy talk. Geez! It's a fantasy world, Rachel. No one is paying attention. Bran, I did your weekend in D.C. with those people. Tonight it's about me and what I want. And I want to party. This is a mistake. You are such a buzzkill. Here, put this on. I'll see you inside. I love you. I hate that smile. I hate, I hate when you give me that smile. Rach, don't go in there alone. Look at me! This is our country and we have to take it back. (Foreign language) Fuck!

Help, help me, help me! Somebody help me! I can't breathe. I can't breathe. Help! I'm here! I'm here outside. Help! Help me! Hold on. I'm here, I'm here. You okay? You okay? No, no. You hurt? Are you hurt? No, get me out, get me home. Okay, okay, hold on. Just hold up. Ow. Let's go that way, come on. Oh my God, my leg. Come on, we have to go, let's go. Somebody is messing with us. Try that door. What's going on? These doors are locked. I don't remember anything. Come on, let's go. I can't remember anything. Let's go. The last thing I remember is taking a pill. Okay, okay. It's just in and out. Stop asking me questions, all right? Let's fucking go. We've got to go. My head hurts so bad. Come on! This is so weird. Oh my God. There's something wrong with my leg. I'll help you, come on. What is that? Oh, my God. What does that mean? What does that mean? It's just paint, look. It's just paint. Come on. Come on, it's just paint. Let's go. I can't move this fast. Thomas, slow down. Hey! Who are you? I'm Clare. Were you both at the party last night? Yeah. And we woke up here and now we're lost. Yeah, me too. She's really hurt. Let's see if we can find you some bandages or something. Hello! Anybody home? Let's check in here. Have a seat. Check this out. Hey, give me that. Who are you? Ack. I saw him coming out of the restroom. I remember him. He fell into me. Yeah, I'm Philip. Uh, I can't remember much. It's a fog. Okay, this is scary. We've got to get out of here right now. You're bleeding. Yeah. I think I saw some supplies. We need to get this scrubbed. There's so much you can catch in here. We need to get this wrapped. I don't know, you guys. There's something about that guy. He might be one of those workers. There's something really weird about him. I think (mumbles). He's coming back. Hold on, I got this. Rachel, give me your leg. Okay, ow. Did you wake up here? What do you mean? I woke up in a fucking morgue drawer. Oh, my God, what's that? All right, we need to get the hell out of here before more crazy shit happens. Thomas. All right, hurry. (Foreign language) Hello! Oh this is good right here. What are all these wires? Oh, not to make matters worse but, these wires are rigged to blow. What? There was a sign when you came in. Did you miss it? Yeah, I guess so. Who's doing this? Definition of a moron. What did you just say? Idiot, moron, definition. Somebody who repeatedly pushes an elevator button when it doesn't work. You better shut up before I jack you up, you fucking bitch. Shut the fuck up, Thomas. Why don't we just take the stairs? Let me help you. Shit, oh shit. Hold up, I think I can get my hand through here. Come on. Is it fucking opening? Come on, let me help. I can't get... All right, let's pull it together, on three. One, two, three. Go that way. Okay, okay. Jerk. Don't touch that, it's gross. Big lie. What is happening? She's gonna cluck. You! Wait, hey! You're dead, you're dead meat. What the hell, Rachel? Branson, just stop it, stop it. Are you okay? Yeah, I'm okay. Why are you asking him? I saw you. I saw you two together. Branson, just stop it. Come on, we've got to get out of here. I ain't going with him. Are you okay? Are you bleeding? What.. There's a dead body in the stairway. What? What do you mean a dead body in.. I don't know. I don't know, I'm not going back the way I came. Come on. Come on! Let's go this way. What a dick. He's always been like that. He smothers me. Where did all the blood come from? I don't care, Man. I just want out of here. You know, how do I know you didn't rob us? How do we know you're not the one into this, huh? You god damn weirdo. Thomas, just stop. You don't want to make it worse. Just, we'll find an exit. Ground floor, finally. Stop, let me out! Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. Wait, let's take a look at this.. Wait for what, huh? I don't need you second guessing me, all right? Step off! Geez. It's not fair. Your loss. You just don't get it. I just don't understand it. I've got this taste for blood but I can't get it out. Just breathe okay. You need to calm.. Don't tell me to calm down, Bitch. What'd you get me into, huh? What are you trying to do to me, huh? I didn't get you into anything. Sorry, it's not fair. Okay, I'm sorry. It's okay. It's okay. You're okay, you're okay. Ah. I'm sorry. You hear that? Yeah, what is that? Oh shit! Bran, run! Go, go! Hold it. Hold the door. Get the door, let's go. What's going on? If I hadn't seen the dead guy, I would've thought it was a joke. What are you doing? Breathing exercises. I don't know, Clare, it's going to take a little more than harnessing your chi to get out of this one. Look around. Is there anything we can use as a weapon? He has an ax, we can't even get close enough. We gotta try. You can get it open. I can't. It sounds clear. No, no, no, we should wait here. It's one guy. With an ax. I'll go check it out. No. I'll go check it out. No, no, no, no. Don't leave me! You'll be safe. Trust me. It looks clear. No! Branson, no! No, no! No, no, no, no, no, no. Just, it's not gonna help. Stop! Come on. Come on. You can do this. You can do this. You can do this. It's somebody playing, let's go. I'm trying. Slow down, Thomas. I can't... What is it? It's locked. Try it again. Try it again! I did. I don't wanna be in here. I don't wanna be in here anymore. Let's just go. Slow down. Hurry up! I can't move as fast as you! What the fuck? What is it? Oh, my God. No, we need to go. I don't wanna go up. I don't wanna go up. Rachel! I don't wanna go, we're gonna die, Thomas. I've never seen a dead guy before. I haven't either. I just want a slice of pizza. Do you think anyone knows we're here? I don't know. Let's go this way. What is this? It's the ICU. A phone. There's a dial tone. Cool, call 9-1-1. It's ringing. No, Thomas, no. No! No! 9-1-1, what's your emergency? 9-1-1. 9-1-1 what's your emergency? I think he's after me. Wait, wait, listen. What are we listening for? Making sure nobody follows us. He killed Thomas. He killed Thomas. He slit his throat. He killed Thomas. I can't. Let's go, come on. Get up. Getup, come on! He killed Thomas. Come on, come on. Come on. Just... Come on. Are we, are we... We're outside. Maybe we can find a ladder and get to the roof. Okay, okay. Let's go. He's still coming. Run, run! Help! Run. What are you doing? I'm ending this. No! No, no. Ah! It's Branson. Branson, no. It's Branson. No! Why won't you just die? It's Branson. Die, die. Die, die. Oh, my God. Branson. He's behind you. Watching that is doing you no good. It's getting in your head. Those people are crazy. Rachel. I know you're in here. Rachel! I'm sorry, Baby. I should have told you everything. Remember that rally in Washington? 1,000 ports of light, Babe. All those community organizations spread throughout the nation, doing good. Doing good! You were a brighter point of light, Babe. You were. But then... They killed a little boy. Ruby Ridge. That girl, she messed me up real good. Let's work together, get outta here. Rach? Rach! We have to stop this new world order. He showed me... That we have to preserve a way of life. I have purpose now. All that suffering... It was worth it. It makes us who and what we are, Rachel. Rachel. Rachel, Rachel. I don't even recognize you anymore. And you desecrated your body with all those markings. I don't even recognize you. I'm glad you lost the baby. You would've made a terrible mother. Fuck you! No, no! No! Stop it! Don't look at me. Branson, Branson! 9-1-1, did you call for emergency? There's no emergency. This number is from the old hospital where we received a call. I didn't call. Ma'am, Ma'am, hello? Do you need help? There's no emergency. Certain that we stand at a defining hour. Halfway around the world, we are engaged in a great struggle in the skies and on the seas and sands. We know why we're there. We are Americans, part of something larger than ourselves. For two centuries, we've done the hard work of freedom. And tonight, we lead the world in facing down a threat to decency and humanity. What is at stake is more than one small country. It is a big idea. A new world order, where diverse nations are drawn together in common cause to achieve the universal aspirations of mankind. Peace and security, freedom, and the rule of law. Such is a world worthy of our struggle and worthy of our children's future. I have spoken of a Thousand Points of Light, of all the community organizations that are spread like stars throughout the Nation, doing good. We will work hand in hand, encouraging, sometimes leading, sometimes being led, rewarding. We will work on this in the White House, in the Cabinet agencies. I will go to the people and the programs that are the brighter points of light and I'll ask every member of my government to become involved. The old ideas are new again because they're not old, they are timeless. Duty, sacrifice, commitment, and a patriotism that finds its expressions in taking part and pitching in. I want to continue to build a lasting basis for U.S. Soviet cooperation for a more peaceful future for all mankind. The triumph of democratic ideas in eastern Europe and Latin America and the continuing struggle for freedom elsewhere, all around the world, all confirm the wisdom of our nation's founders. Tonight, we work to achieve another victory. A victory over tyranny and savage aggression. I'm coming for you! What did you think you'd do, just stab a girl in the back and slip away? This building is going to be your tomb, not mine. Come out and face me, you fucking coward. Talk to me, Philip, you fucking twerp. I know it's you, you little shit. I should have let Thomas beat the shit out of you when he could. Actually, it was your boyfriend who did Thomas in. Ironic, isn't it? You fuck him, he kills him, life is heavy. Why, why are you doing this? What did we do to you? That is such a cliche question. Only those people have to have a reason to kill. It is a new world order now, after all. I've made you a killer. I'm not a fucking killer, you're a killer. You are a killer. You killed your boyfriend, and now you want to kill me. Do it. Your brainwash shit is not gonna work on me. I think it already is. Do it. Come on, Rachel. You see, governments have to have reasons to convince people to kill, but their reasons never seem to make sense. Your reasons here, so pure. Hate is in your heart, Rachel, let it in. Think about all the killings in the Sudan, Somalia, Guatemala. Those numbers never seem to add up, but the bodies, they add up. They number in the thousands. Some reasons are personal, like with Branson. Convincing him was easy because you were such a monster to him. But Branson was weak, constantly needed his itty bitty little ego stroked. Why don't you come over here and I'll stroke your ego. Another time perhaps. So, what, what's your reason? Me? All my reasons are fundamental. After my time in the desert as a soldier, the government made me invisible. And being invisible makes me.. The perfect killer. I can't go any further. It's done. Carrying out the judgement is the true way to salvation. Remember, they for those with knowledge and control those without it. You have laid the cornerstone in the revolution. I hate you, I hate you! Philip, you bastard! 45 seconds, no timeouts. How about that quarterback. I tell you, just right down. Good clock management there, so.. Hey, what's taking you guys so long? One more week. Yeah, we're waiting on the security guard to give us the all clear on the final walkthrough. Some creepy cripple who's taking his sweet time, so I'm not sure how much longer it's gonna be. I'll let you know as soon as we get something. All clear, Boss, let's blow this thing. Hey, we got the all clear. Let's get all the trucks out of here. Philip, I know it's you. I fucking hate you, bastard! I hate you! An undetermined number of young adults were killed yesterday in the demolition of an abandoned hospital located in a suburb outside Atlanta, Georgia. Local police and FBI are working together to ascertain why the young adults had gathered in the empty facility. Breaking news, an illegal rave was held the night before the hospital tragedy. First responders on the scene reported seeing Dead Thirsty graffiti in the rubble. A source close to the investigation reported the FBI is labeling this tragedy as a domestic terror event. FBI link an anti-government movement to the illegal rave movement known as Dead Thirsty. This new extremist group is known for its violently revolutionary ideas. In a rare moment of bipartisan cooperation, President Elect Bill Clinton joined outgoing president, George H.W. Bush to condemn the attacks. It was an act of cowardice, and it was evil. The United States will not tolerate it. And I will not allow the people of this country to be intimidated by evil cowards. Authorities believe the Dead Thirsty group employs an ecstasy-like drug to entice young people to attend illegal raves often held in abandoned properties related to the current economic downturn. In FBI briefings, Dead Thirsty is reported to have carefully planned the Atlanta terror attack for some time. Found in the debris was evidence of bomb making materials. Raiders have spoken out about the tragedy, attempting to distance themselves from the Dead Thirsty movement. I don't understand these people. They're full of so much hate. Think of something wonderful and fun. Don't put it into something evil. So, when you can, party hard, party with the ones you love. Because Dead Thirsty is not gonna stop us. In the first film, we were angry. We were 60s guys and we were angry, but really, it's only the last sort of 20 minutes of that film where it was handheld and trying to imitate news footage, and talking, really, about our anger and the anger that was in the world. You know, all of a sudden, we thought we maybe had changed the world in a positive way.
