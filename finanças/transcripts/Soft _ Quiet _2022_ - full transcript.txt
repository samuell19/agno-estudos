(heart beating) (house creaking) (crying and whimpering) (heels clicking) (door opens) (sniffing) (paper crinkling) (heavy breathing) (urinating) (softly): Come on. Come on, come on, come on. (whimpering) (shaky breathing) (heels clicking) (sniffing) (toilet flushes) (cart rumbling) (birds chirping) (foliage rustling) - Brian. - Hi, Miss Reif. - Is your mom running late? - Yeah. Oh! Well, you don't have to sit out here all alone. You know, next time she's late, come see me in your old classroom, right? You know, we can start your homework... go over history lessons, yeah? Yeah. What's that? Oh, this is a surprise for my friends that I'm meeting. Do you want to see it? - Yeah, sure. (foil crinkling) Well, that looks good. (Emily chuckling) Hey, put that phone away. I mean, you still like reading, don't you? - Yeah. - Yeah. Well, I... just finished my first children's book. And I want you to be the first to read it. "Little Snow was a smart and a happy little puppy. (cart rumbling) He had a beautiful coat of fur. (indistinct) (cart rumbling loudly) ...nice and smart and happy too." Hey, Brian. Do you see that janitor inside? Yeah. I want you to go up to her and tell her that she is not to mop the floors until after you leave. You could've slipped and really hurt yourself. I need you to be a big man here, you know? Teach people how to respect you. Stand up for yourself. Go on. Go on. I'll be right here. (birds chirping) (footsteps approaching) - Hi. - Hey. What's he doing? That woman was mopping right where he was walking. He almost slipped and really hurt himself. - Oh, God. - I know. Well, he's such a sweet kid, right? And he's the first to help his classmates when they're struggling and it's just, with kids like him, I really try and get them to be assertive. Stand up for themselves. Especially when it involves their safety. (footsteps) - Right, okay. Thank you. - Hi, Mom. - Hi, honey. I'm sorry, I'm late. - I'm tired. - I know, buddy. Go get your stuff, we'll go home, okay? Thank you for keeping him company. - No problem. - You're gonna make a great mom. Thanks. Thank you. Have such a good night. You too. Hey, Brian. Don't play too many video games, okay? Okay. Bye. (tense music) (sighs softly) (phone vibrating) This is a prepaid call from... Jeff. ...an inmate at the County Correctional Facility. All phone calls are subject to recording and monitoring. To decline this call press 9 now. And to accept this call pr... (tense music intensifies) (tense music fades out) (birds chirping) (leaves crunching under footsteps) (footsteps approaching) (leaves rustling) (Emily): Hello? (Leslie): Hello. (Emily): Hi. (Leslie): Hi. (Emily): I'm sorry. Can I help you? Oh, no. I'm good. Thanks. Yeah, are you lost? No. I'm just meeting a friend. Okay. Who's your friend? Kim. Oh! (laughing) I'm sorry. I'm meeting Kim too. Why? No, I organized the meeting. The get-together. Oh! (chuckling): Yeah. - Okay. - I'm sorry. - It's good. - Yeah, she mentioned to me that she was... she was inviting someone else, um... I'm Emily. - Hey. Leslie. - Nice to meet you. Nice to meet you. Um, do you need any help with any of this? - Oh, sure. Yeah. Um... - Yeah. Do you want me to carry this? - No, no, no. I got that. Um, you can take this. - Sure. And I'll give you this too. Thank you. - Yeah. Um, so, how do you know Kim? Oh, I work with her down at the store. Oh, wonderful. Yeah, she... she said she was looking for someone to help her out. - Yeah. - So, how long have you been in town? Um, about two weeks, but I used to come through here all the time on my way to Jackson Hole. So it's really familiar. You married? (laughing): No. - What? Um, well, any guy that wants to marry me is fucking crazy. And I don't feel like dating a crazy man. So, no. - Well, do you like the burly type or the lanky type? Um... (chuckling): Hm? - I don't know, lanky? - Oh! Well, I've got seven guys off the top of my head who would kill for a date with you. (scoffs) - No. They're all friends of my husband's. They're great guys. - All right. Well, just let me see pictures first, 'cause I'm not about the blind date. (laughing) - I'm sorry, of course. Remind me after the meeting. - Okay. (sighs): We are upstairs. (softly): Wow. - Leslie! - Sorry. (clears throat) Um, so, how do you know Kim? Oh, I taught her kiddos. - Oh, are you like a teacher? - You bet. Oh, so, you must be like really smart. (chuckles): Yeah. (indistinct chatter) (knocking) Knock knock. Oh, yay! - How are you? - There they are. Look at those pretty girls. Here, let me take this from you. - Got it. - Thank you. We have been snackin' and waitin' for 25 minutes. I'm sorry, there was a straggler at school. You know how that goes. - Mm-hmm. Oh my God. This bitch is hilarious. - Marjorie. - And she brought pie. - I did! - I've got an insane sweet tooth. You love to outdo yourself. You're so good. I thought this was, you know, the perfect thing for our first meeting. (foil crinkling) You know, my way of saying thank you for coming. Oh, fuck. That looks amazing! (Kim): Leslie, we're in a church. Oh, sorry. I'm sorry. It just, it looks so good. (Marjorie): Wait, is this for real? (laughs) (Emily): Why? Can no one take a joke anymore? Why is everyone so serious all the time? (all laughing) (Marjorie): Okay. Let's dig in. (Emily): This is not meant for decoration. Let's eat it. (Alice): We should make this a tradition! Pie for the meetings. - ...as soon as I can, I guess. (Emily): Alice, thank you so much for talking to Father Marcus. This is perfect. - Oh, so easy! Don't mention it. (Kim): Everybody, this is Leslie. She has been helping me and Dylan out at the store. (Jessica): It's so nice to meet you. (Alice): Nice to meet you. (Jessica): Leslie, will you grab me like a little cupcake or something? Oh, yeah. Do you need help sitting down? - I might. - You look like you're caring a little... - Well... - ...a little extra. I am. Thank you so much. (Alice): Look at this. (Kim): Isn't that beautiful? Oh, my goodness. She worked all day and made pie? Oh, my goodness. (Emily): Thank you, Alice. (Jessica): Oh, my goodness. Hm... Ah! (laughing) (Leslie): So good. (Marjorie): So good. - Butter. - Mm-hmm. - Am I right? - Yeah. I mean how can something... so delicious be so bad for you? (chuckling) (sighs) I am really, really happy that we are finally doing this. (Kim): Yes. Um, today I just want us to... introduce ourselves, you know, get to know each other. There's... There's no agenda that needs to be accomplished. We are here to support each other through this multicultural warfare. - That's right. - Mm-hmm. Now, I... I have been brainwashed to feel ashamed of my heritage. To feel... guilt for the prosperity that our husbands, our fathers, our brothers, created in the Western world and that everyone else benefitted from. (Kim): We're all brainwashed. All of us. Um... I'm a teacher down at the school and... Um... I, um... (voice shaking): I really want to be a mom. And, um... getting pregnant is taking a little bit longer than we expected, so... maybe God is giving me a higher purpose, right? (Kim): That's right. (Alice): Right. This club. (chuckling) Yeah. (Alice): Well, I like the name. It has a sense of moving through generations. Yeah. Um... Well, do we want to go around and introduce ourselves? Sort of, I don't know, throw out ideas for what we might want this to be. (Marjorie): Um... (chuckling) I... (Emily): Caught you off guard. I'm Marjorie, um... I'm actually not sure I belong here. I'm sorry, I don't want to make you mad. Just... - No. You can never make me mad, Marjorie. No, I mean that. No, this doesn't have to be anything other than what you want it to be. I mean, is there a particular reason why you did come today? Oh, I just wanted advice with a work thing. Um? Well, do you want to explain what happened and we can talk it out? Um... yeah. Okay, so... I work in town, um... Well, first off I want to say I don't hate her. I don't hate anyone, um... But, yeah, I work in town and I take the bus an hour each way and I have been busting my ass for two years and... so that I could get manager pay. And it's not her fault, but um... but this Colombian girl, she started around the same time as me. Me a little bit before her, well... so she got promoted and I didn't. (Jessica): Of course. (Emily): That's not fair. That's how I felt. (Kim): So did the Colombian woman stick up for you and say, "Hey, she was hired before I was?" (chuckling) - Nope. No, so, I... Quick question. Nobody's gonna post about this, right? Oh, Marjorie. Our constitution was designed to protect you. - Yeah. - Right? You have feelings. Those feelings, they're not wrong. Right. Hmm... Right. So, anyway, I decided to stand up for myself... - Good. - And I asked my manager why she got promoted and I didn't. And he said it was because she has better leadership skills than I do. (laughing) Um... I don't know what happened, but I just kinda snapped, you know? Mm-hmm. - It's 'cause she's brown. - Thank you! And nobody would stand up for me. You know, my co-workers didn't have my back and I... I just felt crazy. (Emily): No. No, you're not crazy. (Alice): You're not crazy. - Yeah. No, it's just like diversity. Inclusion. It's like they're speaking in fucking code. You know what I mean? It's on every fucking form, you know. Every government form, every employment form. Every fucking receipt. You know what I mean? And... Yeah, so I just, I don't know what to do and I... I guess that's why I'm here. Hey. Thank you for sharing. And for speaking up for yourself. I'd like to also add, you know, Mexicans and Blacks can get away with saying things like, you know, "White people are so awful." (Kim): All the time. - Yes! Or "White..." This is my favourite. "White people are the worst." And no one says anything. But the minute we offer up any sort of critique... Ouh! People shout, "racist." (chuckles) (Kim): Yep. Marjorie just know you are in good company, okay? We all kind of feel how you feel and anything you gotta say, you're safe to get it out here. You know, it's like... the Asians come over, they take over companies... get us sick, I don't say anything, you know? And then... (sighs) Urban kids, right? They can't even spell their name and they get into better colleges than me. And it's like okay still, fine. I don't say anything. - Mm-hmm. - Now every brown bitch gets special treatment because they've convinced people to feel sorry for her and it's like... I... then I'm the racist? It's like, there's nothing left for me in this country. Yeah, I'm a good person. I work hard. But I refuse to grow old this poor and have people tell me that I've got it good! I don't. I'm struggling. I work paycheque to paycheque. (sighs) (Kim): Oh, boy. (birds chirping outside) (chuckling) (all laughing) (Jessica): Oh, it is wonderful to see young people in the movement. I can't believe you're not married. Oh, well, don't worry about that. We're gonna help with that. Leslie is in the same boat. (Jessica): I know plenty of great single men who'd just eat you up. (Kim): Well, it's slim pickings for me, but I got a couple if you don't mind older. (all chuckling) (Marjorie): Actually, I only date older men so... Hey! Listen up. How about we all come to the meeting with a list of, like, 10 great guys. (Kim): Yes, great. Great. - Yep. Alice. Hi. I'm Alice up on Owen Street. And, um... I'm tired. I spend a lot of my time alone. In my own thoughts. We're really not supposed to live like that. So... I hope that we can keep growing and keep bringing new people in because just being here with you all, hearing your inspiring ideas, Em... I already feel more like myself. (Jessica): Oh, me too, hon. (Kim): It is so hard being a mom. You can be so isolated. I mean, that's why we need to recruit. (Emily): Yeah, we gotta keep growing. (Kim): You don't have to be going through this alone. Maybe talk to your friends. Start building a little bit more community. Help them pick up groceries. Have them help you pick up kiddos and... - Yeah. You know, you can really introduce concepts anywhere. And of course... (Jessica): At yoga class. (Kim): Yeah! Right. That's perfect. I mean, they're the ones who started Black Lives Matter. They're the ones who are creating this divide. They lit a fuse and then let their kids run wild with it. Emily's life matters. So does mine. All lives matter. (Emily): Yes. We have better doctors. We live longer. We take better care of each other. These are facts. Does acknowledging facts make me a bad person? (Emily): No. Jeez, no. - Oh, my goodness, no. Come here. Come here. (teary laugh) - Thank you. Hi. - I'm Jessica. (all laughing) Well, I wasn't sure what to expect but Miss Emily was real persistent. Um... okay, okay. (sighs) My daddy was the chapter President of the KKK in Valentine, Nebraska, and I have been a member my whole life. I'm more active in Storm front since our lives are online. And I don't normally tell people that because I know what people think about us and, you know, the media loves to portray us as these like big scary monsters. (laughing) But am I really that scary? I'm a mother of four, pregnant with number five right here, and... (sighs) this club just really appeals to me, because, well, it's like I always say, it starts with the mommas and what they're teaching their babies. (Kim): God bless you. Thank God. And I'm not here to cause a fuss. I'm not here to say, "Oh, you know, lynch 'em all," you know, like people might think. No, I'm just... I'm just here to talk common sense. Multiculturalism doesn't work. (Emily): That's right. It's never worked, it's not going to work. They sure as hell don't like us, and... the feeling's mutual. (Emily): Exactly. So... (Kim): I got two kids. You're a momma too? - Yeah. - Oh! Here, I'll pass this to you then. I wanted to have more, but, you know, they are expensive. So, you know, you try to get loans, but, you try getting a loan from the Jew banks. They love saying no. They love it. (chuckling) (Emily): I mean, I cannot laugh. It's true, though. I mean, I don't know when it happened, but we founded this country in 1776, right? (Emily): That's right. And now we're watching it being taken from under our noses in plain sight. Mm-hmm. Dylan, you know, he runs our store and we can barely stay afloat. You see it. (Marjorie): I mean, it's because all the illegal immigrants, they steal. Yes, they do. (groaning): And... oh, God! It's just the whining and the disrespect you get from these coloured kids who come into the store. - (groans) - They just come and barge in, and they're so freaking loud. They're... what is the point of being so loud? And they're doing it just to make sure you can't think straight. I think an ethnic state is the most successful state. I think that's how you ensure unity. I think that's how you regulate the markets. Mm-hmm. I've got a journalism degree. Hm? (all laughing) (Marjorie): That's nice. - And I was thinking about, you know, using it to help out our group. And first thing you got to do, obviously, is take the media back from the Jews. - Mm-hmm. - But Emily and I were thinking about starting a newsletter or a magazine that contains some of our ideas. And if we can get 'em on the shelves, we can start reaching people. - Yeah. - Right. I didn't meet you. I'm Kim, by the way. (all laughing) (Jessica): Hi, Kim. Good to meet you. Leslie. Oh, me? Sorry. I'm Leslie. And... I'm sorry, what am I supposed to say? (laughing) (Kim): Tell whatever you want. Whatever you want. Why you're here. (Emily): Yes, there are no wrong answers, Leslie. I mean that. Okay? - Okay. Well, I'm here because, well, Kim invited me, honestly. And... you know, I've been lucky that I've... I've been very lucky with the friendships that I've made. I guess it's karma for my shitty family. But, um... when I was in prison, I got close with a group of people that really got my head straight. And I really miss that way of life, you know, being told what to do, where to go, it just makes sense for me. So... a friend of mine knew that I needed that out here, so she introduced me to Kim. - Mm-hmm. And that's what she is to me, you know, my stability. And, I love her kids like they were my own. (mouthing): They love her. - I would kill for those babies. And... you know, I want to have a family like that one day. Yeah, I mean, they just... They took me in. No questions asked, so... - No, no. - I'm just here to help. - Aw! You know, in any way that I can. (Emily): Aw! Thank you for sharing, Leslie. - Yeah. - For being here. Um... I would also like to add this. (Alice): Really important. (Kim): Yes. Yeah. You know, these... these libs say that they're fighting for women's rights, right? They're just trying to make us masculine. (laughing) Well, think about it. Who would a guy rather be with? Hm? Marjorie? (chuckles) Leslie? Or some, I don't... blubbering brown whale coming in from God knows what country, with what type of disgusting disease. Ew! For our men's strength and resources... they get this. (all chuckling) Ephesians 5. (Alice): Yes. Yes. Now this, this is the only gender balance that has proven to build strong families. Yeah. (quiet sob) And we need strong families. (Kim): Aw, honey. (choking): You know, it goes back to the 1960s with the, you know, the... the decay of the traditional family which had this... Hm. It really messed us up. (Alice): It did. (Kim): You are such a resource. Beauty and brains. Look at that. I just want to take a minute here to acknowledge all the work you did in organizing this and getting all of our butts into one room. Making pie. (all laughing) Listen, you're really making a difference, okay? For me anyway. - Thank you, Kim. Yeah. (Leslie): And you make really great pie. (chuckling) (Alice): I'm gonna take notes and I'll email everyone afterwards. (Jessica): No. I don't... Maybe we shouldn't have a trail like that. I'm sorry. What have we done that's wrong? No, name one thing that we've said here or done here today that's illegal. Tell me. - You're right. I'm sorry. - No. Tell me. - Um, I... - No. I'm sorry. I just, I'm more... - Emily. Maybe we can talk about the newsletter. Um, I would really appreciate, I don't know about you guys, but I need home schooling materials immediately. Because you should hear what they are teaching my children. Oh, I can only imagine. I can only imagine. I will help you with curriculum. It's... it's actually always been a... a dream of mine to write a children's book. - Aw! - Really? (chuckling) You know you should, um... You should just make your own school. You know, like, really, really like dream big. - Yes! - Put it all out there. Yes! That is a great idea, Leslie. Thank you. Yeah. Um, I... I've actually already started on the book. (Alice): What? - Yeah. Just, you know, after school. Sort of sketching, um... (Jessica): Oh, my gosh. (Marjorie): Let me see. It's really rough, but... (Marjorie): Oh my God. These are amazing, Emily. - He's a cute dog. Aw! (all laughing) How did you learn how to draw like this? My brother. He's the real talent. How creative you both are. All right. (clears throat) The magazine. - Yes! Should we, like, make a list of all the illegal immigrants around the area? So everybody knows where they live and stuff. Um, no, no! Hold on. That's the idea and, you know, everything thus far has been a step in the right direction in the magazine, but we want to be careful with this first issue, right? We want to engage the mainstream, right? We can't come on too strong, okay? Soft on the outside so vigorous ideas can be digested more easily. Hm. Now we are the best secret weapon that no one checks at the door because we tread quietly. Hm. I don't know where this fits into everything, but I think it's important to scold the spic and African parents in front of their kids. That way the child will see the parent as the root cause for their embarrassment and naturally distance themselves and their similarities as they assimilate more quickly. (clamouring) - I'm sorry. (laughing) Wow, Alice... (thud) - Oh my God. - Alice. - It's on me. It's all down my back. - I'm so sorry. (Father Marcus): Emily. I'm so, I'm so sorry. No, I'm sure it's my fault in some way. - Jeez. - I got it. Oh, my gosh. (voices trailing off) - Father, thank you... - Please go. - I'm sorry, we... - Please. I don't want any trouble. - I don't understand, what... - Please, just... I mean it. Just go right now and I won't report you. But right now. (ominous music) (chatter getting louder) Good. I'm glad I didn't ruin the sofa too. (music stops abruptly) - Ladies! Ladies. (Kim): What? - Should be we go back to my place for some wine? Yeah! (Jessica): I would love to, but I can't. Kiddos. - Ow! - Next time. - Next time. - Yeah, I'm sorry. Lars and I have a date night. - Ow! - We'll do it again. - I mean, I'm game. - You sound like an ape when you speak like that. Oh, God, yeah. I guess you're right. Well, I'll help you work on that. I wish I could. Really do, but duty calls. (Jessica): Do we need to clean up? (Emily): Oh, God! No, leave it. - Are you sure? Okay. - Yes! They have staff. Um, Leslie, my dear, are you gonna join us? - Yeah. - Oh, great! - Yeah, sure. - Great. (Alice): We should get the guys together sometime soon, yes? Find me one first, would you? (laughing) (Alice): I have always loved James for you. Wait, wait, the guy that works at the gasoline store? - Yes. Yeah, that's the redhead. - God. Horrible hands. - Marjorie! - Do you think I would like him? - Beggars can't be choosers. - I mean, if you like short and fat fingers. Yes, I think you'd really like him. Sometimes I do. (laughs) Okay. Well, then James is your guy. No, Leslie. Don't listen to her. James would be great for you. - He's sweet. - He deserves a good girl. I get it, I get it. (Leslie): I just want to see pictures first. Yeah. It's always weird when you show up and they're kind of like fucking ew looking. Trust me. - Yeah. Or then when they smile and you see their teeth. - Oh my God. Oh my God! I know exactly what you mean. I've walked out because it's like, ugh! Here. Do you want some? - Yeah. Thanks. - Always pack some extras. - Oh! - Yeah? - It really gets you down to the bones. - Ah! - Look at that moon. That was the first time I've been in a church in... I think since I was like seven. Well, I'm surprised I didn't burn up and go straight to hell. So... (laughs) - God. I feel the same way actually. (laughing) Yeah. - God has maybe forgiven us. I don't know. I mean, he should after going through that. Thank you. Ladies, I'll email you all with the notes later. So nice to meet you both. - Jess, safe home. Have a wonderful night, ladies. Jess! (chuckling) You're so bad. Oh! (chuckling) Um, thanks for inviting me. It actually was kind of cool. Well, it was either this or kill myself. Kim, are you going to the store? - Yeah, for a minute. Why? - We need some more wine. - Yeah. Always more wine. Can we get a ride with you real quick? - Yeah. Yeah. - Do you guys mind a quick detour? I'm sorry. Not at all! (Marjorie): Shotgun! - Damn it! - (laughs) I was just going for it! Okay... Hey! Oh, no. Yeah. No, it went great. Yes, yes, yes, but, Kimmy is actually giving me a ride to the store to pick up some things. So can you pick me up there? Great. Oh, um... Yeah. And actually some of the girls are gonna come over for some wine. Is that okay? Yeah, well, I don't know. Yeah. Yeah. Okay. All right. Yeah. I love you too, babe. (chuckles) Bye. See you soon. (Kim, mocking): See you soon. - Craig... Hey! Craig is excited to meet my new friends. - Oh, he's a sweetheart. - He is. Thank you for coming on into the mom van. Sorry it's so messy. I didn't expect company. Also, sorry about the smell. It's pretty much our family's locker room. So, that's why it smells like feet, I guess. I'm used to this smell. (all laughing) The backroom at the store smells like it too. It's really Dylan. She says it's the kids, it's not. (all laughing) (Kim): Oh, no! Throw him under the bus. - You're funny. Thanks. So, how long have you been teaching? - About five years now. - Wow, that's a long time. - Yeah. - What grades do you do? I do kindergarten. Yeah, really early. - That's so cute. - I know! - They're so, so little. - They're so little. They're so sweet! Ah! I love it. That's awesome. (Marjorie): What age do you teach? Sorry. Kindergarten. Yeah, so like five or six depending on, you know... - Yeah, yeah. ...their birth date. Yeah. Hey, you know... I actually have all of these vintage clothes that I've been wanting to sell and make an online store. - Oh? - And... I don't know, like, I was thinking maybe we could put the money for it towards... the school or the magazine, or something like that. Oh. (Kim): That's a really good idea. - You know, towards the cause. - You would do that? - Yeah. - I mean, I can contribute stuff too. I've got a lot of stuff lying around. (Leslie): That would be awesome. - Yeah. Yeah. And I mean, I still need to take pictures to post them, but... I mean, I don't know, maybe... maybe you'd want to. I mean, you're so pretty. You're basically like a model. - What? What? No. - Yes! - You're being silly! - Emily, you have literally the best genes of anybody I know. Just fishing for compliments! - Kim. No. - You don't look like that. - I am not! - You're like Barbie made real. (scoffs) - Yeah! I should just take you guys around with me all the time. (all laughing) But seriously, we all have great genes, right? (Kim): Yes, we do. Marjorie, I... I don't mean to be staring at your tits, but you have great tits. (Leslie): It's true. And I'm not a dyke. (laughing) (Marjorie): Small but mighty I always say. So will you do it? Will you model the clothes? Yeah. Yeah. (sighs) Gosh, I just... Ah, I want my own school! (Marjorie): You'd be perfect. You really would. I don't know, ladies. (Marjorie): If there's anybody who could do it... And you know what? If niggers can have their own colleges and Jews can have their own community centres and Islam can have its own laws, we can have our own goddamn elementary school, yeah? (Leslie): Yeah. (Marjorie): Amen. (Emily): Um, Leslie, do you have a type of wine you prefer? Um... I don't really. Okay. (Leslie): Red, white, rosé. (Emily): Oh, rosé. (cars passing by) (bell chimes) - I'll be in. Okay. (Kim): Did you do the... (Leslie): I called him, he's coming on Tuesday at 3 o'clock. Okay. (Kim and Leslie chattering) (clears throat) (heels clicking) I'll ring you up. Thank you, Kim. (Marjorie): Oh, hey! (Leslie): I can do it myself. (Marjorie): They're closed. (Kim): Excuse me. (Marjorie): They're closed. (Kim): We're closed. Really? We're just gonna be real quick. We're just getting a bottle of wine. (Kim): I don't care how quick you're gonna be. We're closed. - You're checking her out. Yeah, but I work here. I'm sorry. Do you speak English or do we need to speak slower for you? What? (small chuckle) Look, I had a long day at work too. I understand. Let's just... Can I just get a quick bottle of wine? I'll get the most expensive one. (Kim): This is my store and I can refuse service to anyone. I understand that... but legally you need to have a better reason than being an old, tired cunt. Lily, stop. (Leslie): Excuse me? (Kim): What? Did...? What? (Leslie): Are you fucking serious? (Anne): Let's go. (Leslie): You just walk into our store saying that shit? (Lily): Come on. (Anne): Let's go. You always just take it. Stand up for yourself. That's his sister. Let's go. No. Buy your wine. You said you're going to buy... the most expensive bottle of wine. I mean... (scoffs) Isn't that what she said to you, Kim? - Uh, yes. - Yeah. (Leslie): That's what I heard. You don't need to get it. Come on, let's go. It's all right. I got it. That's $300. (Leslie): Well, that's a really good deal. That's fucking ridiculous, Anne. Come on, let's go. Hold on. Hold on, hold on. (mutters while counting) Okay. We're good. (Emily): Thanks. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. The only people who carry $300 in cash are either whores or thieves. Or waitresses. Sorry, wait a second. (scoffs) What even are you? Yeah. Kinda looks like a chink fucked a wetback. (chuckles) Whatever you think I am is how you're gonna treat me. So I guess that's what I am. - Just let us go. - Hey! Say thank you, faggots. We're sisters. You fucking idiot. What the fuck did you just call me? - Don't fucking touch her! - Get off of me. (struggling) Get off of me! - Get off! - Get off of me! (gun clicks) (screaming) Let go of her fucking purse, you fucking animal. Get the fuck out. - Get the fuck out! - Come, let's go. - Get out! The fuck! - Fuck you! - Emily Reif, you know what they do to rapists like your brother in prison? He's never gonna be able to take a solid shit again. Fuck you! (Leslie): Fuck you! Holy fucking shit! Are you fucking kidding me? (tense music) - No. She's a fucking slut! (enraged screaming) She's a fucking liar. (Craig): Hey. Hey! Hey! - She's a liar. (Craig): What's going on, Kim? (Marjorie): Disrespectful. That was so fucking disrespectful. - You're okay? (Marjorie): The fuck! - What's going on? (Kim): Your brother would never touch that girl. - What's going on? - Much less rape her. What's going on? (Emily): She was threatening me. Who was threatening you? (Kim): The bitch who put Jeff in jail. She was just in here. She just walked in here. I didn't know what she wanted. She walked in here with somebody else. And I didn't recognize her at first. But... I got it. I got it. Hey, we had a long week, okay? Let's go get some wine and go home. - Wait... - Okay? Craig, Craig, you should freaking see all of 'em. They hang outside of Clark's and they just... they are so loud and like animals. - Wait, wait, wait. - Drinking all this... - So you know these guys? - No, I don't know 'em. But she went to school with Anne. I... I didn't know the other one. Hold on, hold on! It's okay. It's okay. That bitch needs to shut her carpet munching fucking face. Okay? You know where she lives? - I... yeah. - Yeah? Yeah? - Yeah. - Let's go. Let's go. Come on. All we'll do is take a shit in her tub or like, steal her fucking passport or something. - Hey. Hey. - She'll never know that it's us. - Come on, now. - No. She cannot talk to her like that. - She can't use that disrespect. - Sweetheart, let's go home. - We shouldn't. - No. We should. What do you mean, you shouldn't? I can go alone, if everyone wants, okay? I can just do it myself. But she cannot be talking to you like that. No. You know what, I'm fucking game. I'm sorry, I'm in. (giggle) I'm in. - Emily. - It'll be fun. - Teach the bitch a lesson. - I'll do it if you do it. - Yeah. Fuck that shit. - Just for a minute. - Okay. Yes, yes, yes. I'll go. - Yes! - I'll go. I'll go. I'll go. - What are you... - This is just like high school! - Let's go get supplies. Oh, man, we're riding again. (heavy music) What? What? (music stops) I didn't say anything. Then what's with this mopey thing? Huh? Do you know what you're talking about here, sweetheart? It's a practical joke. No. It's a fucking felony, honey. Look at me. We had a rough call from the doctor this week... and I think maybe we're not thinking straight. But that's why we'll go home... - This has nothing to do with that. You're so fucking stupid. You want to be a little fairy here? No, that's fine, okay? You want your wife... to look at you every day like a pussy bitch? No, I can live like that. Yeah. But I'm not sure that you can. - Okay. Okay. - You need to be a big man here... and teach people how to respect you. Nobody talks to your wife the way that she did, because that is disrespecting you. Do you understand me? Yeah. Hey. Hey, look at me. (trembling voice): Do you want me to look at you like a fucking faggot, babe? - No. - No. No, you don't. Okay. (sniffle) Yeah. (Kim): You guys are gonna make the tallest, prettiest babies. (laughing) - Oh, Kim. - You are. (Marjorie): Are we ready? We're gonna do it. - I'm ready. - Leave your phones. Hey. Hey! (Leslie): What? - Leave your phones here. - Why? So they can't trace that you've been there. (giggle) (Leslie): That's really smart. (Marjorie): Okay. Okay, Craig. (Leslie): That's actually really, really smart. - Copy that. - Yeah. Cheer up, softy. Let's fucking do this. Fuck. I love you. - Oh, God. - My lady. - Why, thank you, my dear. - Your chariot awaits. Here I come. (laughs) Ahem. (giggle) (Marjorie): Hell yeah. (sighs) (Emily): Ladies. (Leslie): Yeah. (Kim): Oh my God, I can't believe we're doing this! (Emily): No. Kim. (Kim): What? (Emily): This stays here, right? (Kim): Yeah, obviously. (Leslie): Of course it does. (Marjorie): Yeah. Of course, Em. I can't believe we're doing this. I love you guys. Let's turn that music on. (upbeat song) Oh my God. I fucking love this song. Yeah! It's so fucking good. (She raises the volume.) (exclamations) Hey. Hey. Shh! Shut up. Kim, can you turn the music off, please? Fucking Jesus. Turn it off, please. Fuck. - Sorry. - Craig... Buzzkill. (sigh) You know, it's not a big deal. Okay, it's a little bit of a big deal that Alice spilled all over me... and ruined my favourite sweater, but... - I think it'll come out. - Yeah. I just feel like she's kind of clumsy. Is she the person that we want to have taking our notes? Yeah. She is physically clumsy, but she is organized. Hey, hey, hey. Slow down. (Kim): What? - It's right here. Slow down. - Sorry. Where? Left, right? What? - Right. Right. Turn right. Yeah. Turn it slow. It's steep. (Kim): Oh, dear, that is steep. (Marjorie): Holy fuck. (Emily): Kim, we can talk about Alice later, okay? - All right. - Wait a second. Wait a second. This bitch lives on the hill? Yeah. She lives on the hill. (Leslie): What? - I'm in a fucking duplex. And she lives on the fucking hill. Yeah. Yeah. All of this is hers. - Jesus. - I bet she can see the lake from up here. - She can. - How do you know that? (Kim): We just passed by a sign that said: "Leave all your troubles behind." I check up on her. You know, I keep tabs on her. (laughs) (Marjorie): I'm in trouble. You gotta let that go, baby. (Marjorie): Fuck that shit. Is this the only entrance to the property? Well, to the street. Yeah. That's fucking risky, don't you think? If somebody comes home, we're stuck here. Well, then, okay. Well, then, someone needs to stand watch. It's simple. This is it. This is it. - Kim, hold on. (Marjorie): Fucking shit. - That's it? - Yeah. (Marjorie): That shed is fucking bigger than my fucking apartment. Are there pets in there? I don't think so. No. No. I don't know. She lives by herself? (sigh) - Yeah, I don't know. Yes, she lives by her... - It really matters that you know that. Yeah. Okay. She lives by herself. She inherited this place when her mom died. So, yes. She lives here alone, Craig. (sigh, laughs) (Marjorie): Prosecutor over here, Jesus. Just an inquisition here. Fuck. All right. It's as good a time as any, I guess. Five minutes and not a second longer than that. Hold on. I'm gonna wait outside. I don't want to know what the fuck you guys were doing in there. When I come get you, we're leaving. Okay? (laughs) - Yeah. - Okay? Yes. Yes, this is my sexy man! (Marjorie): Oh my God. There's the fucking lake. He's gonna stand watch for us. (Marjorie): That is fucked up. (Leslie): I'm sorry, but I have a question. (Craig): Just pull it up here and kill the engine. If she isn't even home, why do we only have to be five minutes? Is she a good idea? Honestly. - Craig, she is fine. She's fine. (Kim): Craig, she works hard. She's totally solid. (Marjorie): Craig, you need to fucking loosen up, man. Yeah, Craig. I'm solid. Five minutes and not a second longer than that. What do you think of that? (Leslie): I'll bring the wine. (Marjorie): Jesus, man. (Emily): Babe! We're just fucking having a good time, man. Babe, use your upper body strength. Kim, you're in the back. (Kim): What? Okay. (birds chirping) Fuck. (heavy music) (Kim): She has a kayak! - Shut the fuck up. (Leslie): Why do we need to be so quiet? She's not even home. - Just shut the fuck up. (Leslie): I know, right? So dumb. - Hold on. Hold on. What? What? I fucking hate this. I have a really bad feeling. There's too much space between the house and the road. We're not gonna get everybody out unseen. Emily... (♪) (dog barking) Does she have a dog? I don't know. Shut up. Shut up. (Leslie): It's a puppy. (Marjorie): What? You can't take a dog, Craig? Shh, shh, hey, buddy. He's so cute. (Leslie): Wait, should I grab a rock? And we can fucking throw it through the window. (Craig): No. You should look for a hide-a-key. (Marjorie): A hide-a-key? What the fuck is that? (Leslie): Seriously? (laughs) - Leslie! Shh... - I found it. It was really right the fuck there? Really right the fuck there. I'm surprised this bitch hasn't been burgled before. (laughs) - Shut the fuck up. What? (Craig shushing) (Emily): He's excited to see us. - Get the dog. Hello. Hello. Come here. (Marjorie): Oh. It's a big house. (Kim): Oh my God. - Baby. - Oh my God. - Oh, wow. Look at these floors. That's beautiful. Hey. Hey. Four minutes and I'm gonna wait outside. - Cool. - Kim, I'm not fucking around. Okay? - I know. - Man, you have lost a lot of your sense of humour these days. Oh my God. She has a washer and a dryer. - Nice. - Front loaders. I wonder if it's one of those smart ones where you can control it on your phone. What I would give... never to go to the laundromat again. That's shitty art. (Emily): Aw, sweet baby. - This is very shitty art. - It's shitty art. - Let's see if we have anything to... Yes! (exclamations) Save one of those beers for me. Will you? - Maybe. We'll see. - Sweet baby. Look at this baby boy. Look at this sweet baby boy. - He's cute. He's so scared. Where is your mommy? She left you alone. Why did she leave you alone? (Kim): Wait, what are we... (loud thump) - Jesus Christ! - Fuck, Marjorie. Fuck me. - Let me in. (laughs) - Get in here. I'm sorry, am I being too loud? Craig. Craig! (shushing) Fuck! Are you fucking kidding me? How do you turn... Fuck. Are you fucking kidding me? I always wanted a fucking piano... (plays off-key) but we could never afford one. (glass breaking) (Leslie): Oh, fuck! (laughing) I'm sorry. I'm sorry. It just... fell. I'm sorry. - What did you do? - I just dropped the glass. - Just clean it up, okay? Okay. I'm cleaning it up. (Marjorie): No, this piano is a... - Kim. - Yeah? Yes, Emily. - Help me find the passport. I'm gonna check upstairs. (Marjorie plays a song on the piano.) Can you hide in here? Yeah. (Marjorie): I always wanted to play piano, but... (Kim, from afar): It's freezing up here. Kim! (Kim): Yeah! Are you upstairs? (Kim): Yeah. Did you find anything? (Kim): Not yet. It's dark. And, ooh, cold. It's very... Did you check under the bed? (Kim): Yeah. I just did. But I didn't see anything there. You checked the... Ouch! See? See? - What is with this ceiling? - Us, tall, blonde models gotta worry about that, don't we? - Kim. Did you check in here? - No. I mean, no, not there. - Oh, God. - Found her underwear drawer. Eww! I bet they smell. Let's see. Let's see. It's like... (high-pitched scream) What? - I found it! I found it! - You found it? - I found it. - Wait! - Oh my God! You found it. - You found it? - What are we doing with this? (excited laughter) Yes. - We found it! We found the passport. (Kim, singing): 'Cause we know this bitch is not American! Oh, we found the passport! I'm just playing the fucking piano. Jesus Christ. - Who has a lighter? - No, no, no. Let me do it. - Oh my God, are we burning it? - Hey! - Let me do it. - Kim. - I saw matches. - That was not five minutes, Craig. It absolutely was. Please, can we go? - It wasn't five. - We shouldn't burn it here because there's like smoke alarms. (intertwined chatter and screams) - Leslie! Sorry. I'm not gonna burn the house down. - Emily! Let's go! We'll burn it... - Oh, my gosh. Let's burn it in your fire pit at home. (car approaching) - Shh! - But we should check... Shh! What? (car door opening) - Hide. - What? - Hide right now! - Oh my God. - Hide and get out when you can. - Oh my God. This way. - Fuck! - Shit. - Fuck! Oh, shit. - Move, move, move. - Shit. Fuck! I fucking told you. Is that better? Fuck! Fuck! (whimpering) (footsteps approaching) Willie? Willie? (tongue clicks) (Craig): She's leaving. Stop her. Get her. Get her. (panicked chatter) - Get her. - Fuck, fuck, fuck. Shit. (screams) Oh my God. (Craig): It's okay. Just don't move. It's okay. It's okay. It's okay. - Grab a chair. - Here. - Put her right there. - I got it. I got it. (Craig shushing) - Give me your hands. - Shut the fuck up. It's okay. - Give me your hands. - I'm sorry. It's okay. It's just a practical joke, okay? It's just a joke. I'm sorry. We're leaving. Okay? - Emily. What the fuck? - We're leaving. What are you fucking doing? (Leslie): What do you think I'm fucking doing? I'm fucking holding her down. Kim, let's go. Let's go. - Sorry. Let's go. - Let's fucking go. Kim, what the fuck are you doing? (screams) Shut up or I will fucking kill you! Do you fucking hear me? This is all because you fucking sassed us back there. Do you fucking understand this? This is not funny anymore at all. This is big trouble. - Okay. It's okay. - What are we doing? - Okay, I love my fucking job. - Em? - And Terry needs me. I don't want to go to fucking jail. It's okay. Just stop it. Just stop it, Craig. Stop whining and whimpering like a fucking cunt! I'm sick of it! - Emily! - We were just joking around. - What are we doing? - What the fuck are you doing? What do you mean, what am I doing? I don't know what I'm doing. I'm trying to help. Kim! (Anne whimpers.) Let's go. (whimper) (Marjorie): Where is he going? (Leslie): He's fucking scared. (Craig): Jesus fucking Christ. (shaky breathing) Hey. Hey. It's okay. It's okay. Stay. Stay, stay. (Lily): Help! Leave me alone! (Craig): Shh! It's okay. (Lily): Stop! (Craig): I'll explain. I can explain, okay? We're gonna go inside now. I'm gonna explain. Just please, come with me. Come with me. - Stop! Stop! Please stop! Yeah, just come inside and I'll fucking explain it to you. Okay? Please? Just come with me. I'm sorry. I'm fucking sorry. I'm sorry. It's just... Hold still. Okay? Please! Fucking please! - Please stop! - I don't wanna fucking hurt you. Okay? Please don't make me fucking hurt you. Okay? Okay? Just come on. I'm sorry. I'm fucking sorry. Let's go inside. Let's go inside. Here. Okay? Okay. Okay. What the fuck? (screams, panicked whimpers) Don't worry, you'll be fine. Stop. Stop. Stop. Stop it. (whimpers) Stop it. (Marjorie): Did you just shove me, you fucking bitch? (loud thumps) - What the fuck is this? (whimpers) Hey. Hey. Hey, babe. Get the fuck off of me. Get the fuck off of me! (whimpering) Craig, where are you going? Craig, Jesus! - Craig! - Craig! Craig! Craig! Craig! We don't need him. Okay? We don't fucking need him. You don't need him. You are better than him. He is a little fucking pussy. Do you understand? We don't need him. (heavy breathing) (whimpers) (Marjorie): Shut up, shut up. Outside. Everyone, outside to talk. Don't move. Don't move. Outside now. All of you. We are fucking watching you! Do you fucking understand that? That gun is on you at all fucking times! Kim! - Yes. - Keep it on them! - Yes. I got them. I got them. Okay. They're moving closer. We gotta scare the shit out of them. They have seen our faces. They know who we are. Is that really gonna work if we just scare them? Yeah. We just have to scare the shit of them. I don't know. I don't know. She's tough, you know, she has... Then we really scare the shit out of them. (shaky breathing) I can't, I can't. Kim. Kim. I need my babies. I can't. I understand. And you can do this. I need you. I can't do this alone, Kim. Okay? - Stop looking at me! Okay, I need you to calm down and think. - Yeah. Yeah, I am calm! - Okay? You're calm. Okay. I think it's the only way. Emily, it's the only way. We just gotta go really hard and scare the shit out of them and just fucking commit. I mean, is there anything else we're not thinking of? (crying): They weren't supposed to be fucking home. Okay, listen. Okay. Everyone just needs to relax. All right? This shit isn't that complicated. Kim. Kim, you are tight with every single fucking cop that comes into the store. I have seen it. If they ask us anything, we'll deny it. All right? - Yeah. We will get rid of all of our evidence. Get rid of our fingerprints... everything that we ever fucking touched in here. Get rid of our trash and that's it. All right? It's their word against ours with no evidence. And trust me, by the time I'm fucking done with these bitches, I swear to God, they will fucking leave town. All right? All right? - Yeah. - I'm gonna fix this. (whimpers and cries) Kim, I'm gonna fix this. All right? And this part will be fun. Oh my God. - We need to... - Okay. - We need to... - Shh. Let's scare the shit out of them. We clean up. And we're out. - We should leave right now. We should leave right now. - Yeah. Then leave. Just go. Shit. Okay. Are we gonna do it? Why would you show up for a meeting dressed like a fucking whore? Disrespect! Get the fuck in here! - Oh my God. Fuck! (Kim): Will you help me? Please, Marjorie? I just wanted some fucking wine! Jesus fucking Christ! - They're touching each other. - Okay. I got it! I got it! Kim! I got it! - Jesus Christ! - Let go. Let go. - Get the fuck off of her. - Jesus. Jesus fucking Christ. Stop moving! This is all because you decided to stand the fuck up for yourself. Calm down. (indistinctly): Emily. Emily. - Hey, little bitch. Hey, little bitch. I need your fucking phone. I need to play some fucking music. Oh! Hold on. You know what? I bet you her phone is in her purse. Wonder if you have any more whore money. Okay. Fuck. Okay. This is the United States of America. - Oh, shit. - It's not your fucking country, is it? - Okay. Wait. Will you take her phone? - Wait. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. Yeah. That's... (Emily): What kind of tunes do you like, honey? - Emily! Emily, please just let my sister go! - Got it! All right, let's see... - Oh, wait... - Got it. You want us to let your sister go? (♪ Behind My Eyes by Apashe & LIA) (Leslie): You want her to be let go? Okay. Maybe we should let her go. Well, you know what actually, you look so frail. How about we feed her? - Yeah. - Yeah. Maybe get some food in her. It's protein. Yeah. How about you, Marjorie? How about we feed her? (screams) Shut up. Get the fuck away from me. Stop moving. Stop fucking with your sister. Calm down. I'm not gonna break you. I'm just gonna fucking feed you. (whimpers, intertwined chatter) Get her fucking hands. Open up. Open your mouth. (coughing) - Here you go. How about a banana? Yeah. You wanna come with us and eat a banana? - Have some banana. - I think she's finding it a little dry. A little liquid. A little liquid. (intense coughing) Oh. There it is. Here you go. Are you fucking thirsty? Get it open. Here you go. Here you go. She's thirsty. Your hair is so dry, baby doll. (Kim): Did you steal that whiskey from my fucking store? Let's moisturize it for you. (intense coughing) (whimpers) (♪) (indistinct chatter, cries) (laughter) (wheezing, coughing) (panicked screaming) There you go. There you go. Stop moving! Stop it! Marjorie! What are you doing? I'm taking a video with her phone. What are you doing? What did you not understand about leaving no trace? - Well, I just thought it was a fucking video. - Jesus fucking Christ. (wheezing) Hey! Look at me. Look at me. Look at me. Look at me. Were we ever here? - Were we ever here? - Were we ever here? - Were we ever fucking here? - Were we ever here? - You liar. - Are you ever gonna fucking say anything? You are a lying little whore, aren't you? Were we ever here? She's choking. - She's choking. She is choking. Oh my God. Hit her on the back. Hit her on the back. - Get it off. Get it off. A little help here! Fuck! Fuck! What is wrong with her? What is wrong with her? - What is wrong with her? - What is wrong? - Get her up. She's choking. Oh my God. Oh my God. What's wrong with her? Peanuts! Peanuts. She's allergic to peanuts. Oh, fuck! Oh, fuck! Get her EpiPen in the purse in my room, please. (Leslie): I'm sorry. I can't hear you. Please. Please. Please. (Leslie): I can't...

Give it to her! Kinda looks like we're too late though. (screeching) (whimpers) No. Oh, no, no, no. (cries) - Fuck. Fuck! - Oh, no, baby. - Shit. Oh my God. - Lily. - Oh, my fucking God. - Lily, wake up. - What's happened to her? - Oh, no, no, no. What did you do? Oh, God. You did it to yourselves. She fucking resisted. She fought back. It would've been easier for her if she'd stopped and had some respect. - Why did you do this? - It's her fault. It's her fault. No, baby. Wake up, Lily. I love you. No, no, no, no, no. Wake up. Wake up. Oh, no, no, no. (cries) Oh, no. (Emily): Kim, what are you doing? (Kim): We have to make sure that... (Leslie): Take these. (Kim): Okay. (Emily): What are you doing? (Kim): We have to make sure this place is spotless. We have to wipe down every surface. We have to take all of our trash. (Emily): What about her? (Kim): I am not losing my kids. Do you understand me? I'm not. None of this has gone the way I wanted it to go. (indistinct screaming) - Try to relax! Okay? You! You! You did this! - I didn't do anything! - You did this! You trash! We did this for you! - No, I didn't! - You did this! You did! We did this for your ass so fuck you! Shut up! Shut up! It is nobody's fucking fault! We didn't fucking know that she was fucking allergic to peanuts. So shut up! (sound decreasing) (inaudible) (sound increasing) Marjorie. Marjorie! (teary voice): Get in here! Kim. - What? Come here. We all need to get gloves on, okay? What? Put gloves on. (heavy breathing) Oh my God. We need to make it look like a rape. What? No one's ever gonna suspect women if they're raped. Why are you looking at me? I'm not gonna fucking do it. Kim, I'm not asking you to do it. I can't... I can't... We should go. No! We need to clean up our mess. Look, it's no one's fault, okay? Just do it. I'm going to. - I am helping clean. - I need a fucking carrot. I'll just keep cleaning. Oh, God. We shouldn't have worn shoes. I'll tell you that much. (Anne): No. No. No. Shut the fuck up. Shut up! (Anne): No! No! This is how you learn. (Anne screams and cries in pain.) You deserve it. Oh, God. Oh my God. Oh my God. Oh my God. Oh my God. Oh my God. (piano notes being struck) Oh my God. (sniffles) Bitch. (whimpers) (shaky breathing) I'm... I'm really sorry that I yelled at you. Okay? - Okay. I was just really, really panicked. I know. And you didn't do anything wrong. And I don't think I can do it. And... I know that you're really strong. So... Yeah. Yeah, I'll do it. I'll do this for you. And then you'll model my clothes for me. (retching) - What? My clothes. For the online store. You'll model them. (Kim): Oh, God. - Yeah. (Kim): Oh, God. (retching) (Emily): I'm gonna throw up. Kim. Go outside and find something for the body. Okay? Oh, Jesus. Fuck. (whimpers) (grunting) (Anne's whimpers stop.) (heavy breathing) (Emily): Fuck. (Kim): I found this. I don't know what to do. - That works. That works. Okay. Okay. - Marjorie. - What? Come help me. Come help me. Come help me. - What the fuck? All of our trash goes in here. Okay? Oh my God. Oh my God. Oh my God. Oh my God. Breathe. (heavy breathing) Breathe. I need you to breathe. Okay? Can you carry these cans? - Okay. - Can you carry these cans? Okay. Good. Good.

Just get in the fucking car. (insects chirping) Get in the fucking car! (shaky breathing) (Kim): Did you get everything? (Emily): I got everything. (Kim): After we dump them, we gotta come back here and we gotta clean everything. (Emily): Okay. (Kim): Carefully. Okay? - Okay. Yes. (crying): Every single inch and we'll erase fingerprints. Everything will be spotless. (Kim): Everything. (Emily): It will be fine. No one. No one will know we were there. No one will ever find out. Okay? Oh, fuck. (shaky breathing) You're okay. We're okay.
