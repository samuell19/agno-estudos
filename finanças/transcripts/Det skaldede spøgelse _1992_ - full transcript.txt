Aron, it's I, Jasper. You'll remain here. Manuscript by THE BALD GHOST Producer Dear God, It's I, Jasper. Aron must not be dead! Couldn't you make him just apparently dead? You can see that he must wake up. Otherwise his boat will sink. This is the best knife in the world. I’ll give it to your Witch’s Claw, if I can get Aron back. Aron? Prust! Well, Prust. Jasper, get some sleep will you. Aron has peace in his coffin. Do as your mother says, Jasper. - How about that! - Three aces ... You are cheating! - Good morning. - Good morning. - Good morning. Sigumhøj, our teacher came along, and we are short of time. - Well, there is time for some coffee I hope? - I don't drink coffee this early. - I follow the vicar. - Hello Maurids. Aron’s old adultery cat. He always wished to be buried in his cupboard. Over my dead body ... so to speak. An ungodly thought! You can be buried with your belongings. In the chapel you only enter in a proper coffin. Stop! He's only apparently dead! There, there. Aron. Aron! That's loyalty if you ask me! To be buried with his own master. But that wasn't Aron’s wish. No, he's your now, Jasper, and that was Aron’s wish. He often said that. - Take good care of him. - "In eastern sky the sun will rise, "and sprinkle gold on clouds." "on rolling sea and mountain top, "lights up both land and towns." I'll take care of you. I promise; just as well as Aron did. Will he be burned or be a skeleton? Aron will rest in a grave for the unknown, and there's only room for the ashes. Prust will soon be happy again. He's got you now. Don't forget school! You saw him too, Prust, the man in the boat this morning. Do you think that the Witch’s Claw took him? I really will miss him! School! You stay here, Prust. You're never in time, Jasper! That's no good, no good at all. You'll be left behind on everything. I had to settle things with Aron and Prust. Aron is dead, and don't blame the dead. Be seated. "Begone all witches. Begone all trolls." That's what we say when we wish to separate good from evil. The Midsummer bonfire is a heathen custom. - But the celebration of St Hans is in fact a holy feast that belongs ... - Sir! Yes boy. When you're speaking of good and evil, sir you could think of Jasper. He's done a good deed today you see. That's why he was late. He did a good deed, and separated good from evil. I don't quite follow you, Maurids. What good deed? Jasper has drowned the adultery cat. That's a lie! Order! You are disturbing, Jasper, and so are Maurids and Thorkild. We have serious matters to discuss. It's summer and you will all bathe in the stream. Not being able to swim is dangerous. You cannot handle the currents and whirls if you cannot swim. See how I do it. I'll lie down on the desk. Lie down on your desks, and do as I do. - Prust. - I turn around. Turn around and lie down all of you. We start with the arms. Arms forward, then backwards and stretch your legs. - Arms forward and stretch your legs. - I don’t have to attend gymnastic class, and I can swim. Kick your legs backwards, arms forward and stretch your legs. Good, once more. Arms forward and stretch your legs. Adultery cat! Where are you going, Jasper? Prust! Aron? There, Prust. There. Did he hit you with the stone? You mustn’t roam around like that. That's dangerous. Forgive me, Mr Spider, but I need your cobweb. Aron has told me that cobweb is good on wounds. Look, Prust. Now he will make a new web. That's good for you, Prust. It helps. Look, Prust. It's dead ... like Aron. Prust! You have eaten what should have been buried ... ... almost. Dear Lord God, Prust and I have buried a fish that couldn't swim. Make it swim again in the stream where the unknown are! That's were Aron is. If Aron has no boat there, get him his old boat back by some magic. And greet him from Prust and me. Amen. Daddy! In ancient days people often was buried with their belongings. That would have been easier even now. You keep this. It's too nice to burn. Don't be afraid, Prust. You are worth quite a lot, and I'll take care of you. Prust is an old cat, Jasper. Don't put a too high a value on him. A... r... o... n... - Aron is an unusual name. From where did he get it? - Well ... - People have lots of different names ... - Sigumhøj finds my name odd too. - Well, that teacher of yours ... - I use to ask him about my name. You should be quiet and attentive! - But that is my name! - When I’m finished for today, I'll show you the origin of your name. Here comes my helping hand. Off you go, so we don’t trip over you. I take Prust, so he won't trip over you. Well, Prust, what do you say about this? A lady visit. - Hello, girls! - Hello, teeny! - It's fun. Is it yours, Jasper? - Yes. It was Aron’s before. It’s cool, isn't it? It becomes you, Beatrice. Is it a lover’s gift, Jasper? Isn't it dangerous to swim here? Here it's OK, but downside the pier it's dangerous, and near the Witch’s Claw it's deadly! The stream has taken a lot of people. The Witch’s Claw captures people, and drags them into the whirls. - What's the matter? Stop it! - Thorkild! Jesper is a dim-witted mealworm. It is OK to swim here. Stop showing off for the girls, Jasper! You'll pay for this! - Snatch it if you can! - Let him go! You're so wicked, Maurids! That's dangerous! Serves you right. He could have caught it. Come here, Jasper! - I wonder what’s in it. - It’s a “monster piece”! There you are, Jasper. Get the key to the cupboard, will you. - Strange! - Aron took the key when he died ... or one of the unknown did. This’ll be the biggest St Hans bonfire in living memory. Is the cupboard for the bonfire too? No, it's almost too nice. Maybe someone can make use of it. - And now a nice game of cards. - Well no, I have my book-keeping. - How about tomorrow? I need you at the school. - OK. - See you! You promised you'd show me something ... my name. It's getting late, Jasper. We long for home. You must keep a promise. You've said that yourself. I keep mine to Prust. Prust stays here! Is it in the vicarage? No, you only go to the vicarage if you really have to. Let's go, Jasper. Well, Prust, please avoid the “Holy Cat” in the vicarage will you! Don’t forget about Maurids. He’ll cut your ears away! Let's go, Jasper. Does my name come from the dead? All names do. Is this the grave for the unknown, daddy? Peace be with you, Aron. I don’t think he has peace, daddy. Yes, Jasper, Aron is resting in peace. It's us, the living, that do not. Now we must be quiet, Jasper. We won’t wake up the dead beneath the floor. Marvellous, isn't it? See, I can almost make it come to life. You don't have to tell me today, dad. Look, here it is. It’s very old. We learned the text in school. Listen. - "An unknown man of God came to the town at the ford ..." - Our town? Yes, our town. "An unknown man of God came to the town at the ford ..." "The sickness and the ‘suht’ made halt at the stream.” “Neither man nor beast died thenceforth ...” Now it's about you. “and the name of that man of God was Jasper.” “He was henceforth a blessing for the parish.” “God bless his soul with eternal bliss.” “Amen” What is "suht" really? - "Suht"? - Yes. - Well, "suht", that is ... "suht" ... ‘Suht’ is and old Nordic word for 'sickness'. “ ...the sickness and the ‘suht’ made halt at the stream.” Do you understand? No, not quite. "Oops, a bend is on my way," “there’s my house where I will stay." Here you’ll live from now ... with Jasper and with the best mom and dad in the world. You must never swim on the other side of the pier! What if the Witch’s Claw had caught you! - Prust has got a wound. - Well, "there are many ways of skinning a cat." That’s his only concern. He definitely is a stray cat, and the father to all the kittens in town ... to those in the vicarage too. I believe he misses Aron. Now I will tickle you! Stop that, please. I’m calculating taxes, and percent and denominations! Refuge! This is for you, Prust. - Prust and I will go to bed now. - Good night. Your home is up here from now on, with Jasper. You miss Aron, don't you? So do I. But I can tell you that it helps being two. Be happy you have me. Aron is with the unknown, and we don't know much about them. Otherwise they'd no longer be unknown. Or he might dwell among the stars. The sky is a very, very large place. You are indeed two night-owls. Look! - This is Prust's own bed. - Thank you. Get under the blanket, Jasper. Sleep tight ... both of you. Say good night to daddy. You are an old stray cat, but you're a nice cat anyhow. Go and make your usual evening tour, but beware of the vicarage. Dad. Dad! Dad are you asleep! Yes, we are asleep ... almost. Jasper, why aren't you in your bed? - There is someone outside. - That's just drivel, Jasper. I hear sounds as from a thief. You had a dream. He's making sounds and sounds can’t come from nowhere. Fine, fine. Well then, let’s stick our nose out, and scare your ghostly thief away. Then we'll have some peace and quiet. OK? Well then? Here he is, your thief! Leave it! You know the key is missing. In you go. - But dad ... - No, come on ... - There is something ... Dad, the door was ajar! - But dad ... - No more ghost stories. Go to your room. - But dad ... In you go. - Thorkild! Put up your hand before you speak! - It's nice to know where your name comes from. My name is written on a stone in the church, so it's a very old name. - My father read it ... - Unbelievable. Mealworm's father can read! There's a painting by him in the church. See it for yourself. The name of that man of God is Jasper. It says so. He appeared from the unknown; nobody knows from where. If his name was Jasper, he must have come from Loonyland. Amen in the church and that's it! - Silence, Maurids. No cursing in school! Jasper could have a point in this. The man on that stone was surely a wise man. - One day we'll go there, and I'll guide you around. - If he was so wise, his name couldn't have been Jasper. If you have something to say, Maurids, you put up your hand. My father! Sit down, Jasper. At once! My father is here with Aron’s old cupboard. - With Aron’s old shit. - You hold up with that, Maurids! - Be seated, Jasper, and put up your hand if you have anything to say. - There is my father. Class dismissed! - Hello., This is Aron’s cupboard. - Yes. Well ... The town council wants everything cleared away there. We’ll put most of it in the fire. But we found this too nice to burn, and then we thought of you. - Yes, it could come in handy in the school. - It could also be of some value. Yes ... it looks interesting. Could we have it in our classroom, sir? It's a very special cupboard ... isn't it? Yes ... These is no ... The key is missing, sir. Aron has it, and now he dwells among the unknown. And one of those ... lives in the cupboard. Let's have it in our classroom, sir. Otherwise, someone else might want it. My father would have it. Darn, has the vicar really said that? Yes, I heard him say that. Well if the vicar wants it, to the vicarage it shall go. - But if the children could enjoy it in the school ... - We already have a lot of cupboards. - But, sir ...! "... hold. We want peace for all lands," "Sanctus Hans, Sanctus Hans." "It can be found,” "if our hearts never doubt and turn cold." - Have you seen Prust? - He was at home when we left. - This'll just take a moment, Jasper. - There you are at last ... - I hope you'll be content. ... So this is the renowned cupboard ... It's filthy and dirty. - Why did you bring it here? - But dear, it's an antiquity. It must have some cleaning up. - I’ll just ... - Do you have the key, please? - Well, something is amiss; the key is gone. Take it away, and that's final! Come back, Prust! The adultery cat is stealing our food! Take that filthy cat away. And off you go all of you! What did you think of? Bringing a cupboard without a key! It's worthless! I knew we'd get a problem with this cupboard. What’ll do to Prust? He’s always running away. Don't worry, a cat will always find its way back home. A sausage from the vicarage ...! - It's your fault. - Come in at once, Jasper. We will not be in debt to the vicarage! You go there and give them another sausage. - What will I say to them? - You'll just give them the sausage. Apologize for your cat's manners, and for that you didn't look after him properly. But that's not true! I apologize on my cat's behalf ... and its manners ... and on my own behalf for not looking after it. I apologize on my cat's behalf ... and its manners ... and on my own behalf for ... for ... Here’s another sausage. Aron. Aron, it's I, Jasper. I miss you. If you can hear me. I don't know how things are among the unknown. If they can hear. I must tell you about Prust. He too miss you. He’s whining and goes his own ways. To be responsible is not that easy. Now they say that he has stolen a sausage at the vicar's. But that's not true. I apologize on my cat's behalf, for its manners and for not having properly looked after it. I apologize ... Sleep tight, Aron. I apologize on my cat's behalf, for its manners and for not having properly looked ... I bring another sausage, in replace for the eaten one ... the almost eaten one ... from my mother. I apologize on my cat's behalf, for its manners ... So, Jasper Mealworm! This is a sausage from my mother. - What are you doing here? - You enticed Prust. Prust commits adultery. He is condemned! You'd better realize that. - Condemned to death! - You cannot do that! You’re just jealous! We don't eat cat fodder, little sissy Jasper! Why don't you go swimming with the girls, and show them your little mealworm! And pretend you have a girlfriend, you idiot. Monkey face! What's happened, Jasper? Nothing. I want to go home. Could I get some peace and quite, please? I've polished it. - Can I see it? - Yes be careful. I think one of the unknown lost it, and I actually saw one of them. You see so many exciting things, Jasper. Pooh, it's some old junk. It is a greeting from the unknown. The moon was shining on it on our garden walk. It's a big fat lie! - It's nice, isn't it? - Yes it is. Beatrice, Penelope and Jasper, we’re having a swimming lesson! Look what Jasper has found, sir. He claims he's got it from the unknown. Yes, all of a sudden it was there! Oh dear! It's really shining, Jasper. What could it be, sir? I've no idea, but it looks old. It could be an ancient find, a so called Dana-find. - Oh, Jasper has found a Dame’s behind! - No Thorkild, not at all. A can opener. An ancient Nordic beer can opener! I’ll put it in my pocket. One day we’ll pay the museum a visit and find out what this really is, this found of Jasper’s. Let's go swimming. - What, Maurids? - I don't have to swim. - Then you can be my assistant instead. Come! "The most gorgeous ... The most heinous tomcat in the world," "condemned to a miserable death ..." "if ... if you put a value on his life," "you can find him in the church." "at midnight." - Have you seen Prust? - No. He just ran off. I call that truancy! What is wrong with that boy? - That's not our Jasper; running away like that. There must be an explanation. Explanation? He shirked from the swimming lesson, from the books and his clothes. It must due to some cause. - Shall I take that as an accusation? - Those are your words, Sigumhøj. I won't tolerate this any more. I see you kept Aron’s cupboard for yourself. That's theft! A mean theft! I've had enough of this wretched cupboard! I'll get rid of it now. Now! Stop that talk! You know Sigumhøj, don't you? I'll take this cupboard back to where it came from ... Now! Don’t you dare blame the boy. It must be something we probably don’t understand. Hello, Jasper. - What are you doing with Aron’s cupboard? This cupboard stays here, where it came from. Well, nobody wants it anyhow. Prust is gone. He's always roaming about. - He's held captive in the vicarage. - Captive? Yes, captive. Prust and the Holy Cat are lovers. I dare you he's there of his own free will. "The most heinous tomcat in the world," "condemned to a miserable death." "if you put a value on his life," "you can find him in the church." "at midnight." Dear Lord God. Please give me Prust back. Good night, Jasper, and sleep tight. And when you wake up tomorrow, I'm sure Prust is back. Aron, it's I, Jasper. Please don't be afraid. I've come to get Prust. Prust, it's I, Jasper. I'll pay Maurids for this. Have you seen Prust? He was Aron’s cat. I'm taking care of him. Maurids has condemned him to death. - I'll pay him for that! - I can clearly understand your wrath. But vengeance is a bad thought. - My name is Jasper. - Jasper. - It could be the name of a rare flower. - Or a holy man. - Right. Vengeance is never a good thing. - But see what he has done! - Vengeance leads to vengeance, and so the evil will never die. There's one sole way to fight evil ... and that is to fight for the good. Who are you? - My name is Innocence. - Innocence? An old name that means 'the innocent'. - Is that why you are bald? - No ... Wish to touch it? Are you one of the unknown? Then you must know Aron? He too is one of them. Aron and you were friends? Yes ... Now Prust has only me. Wakey, wakey, Jasper. So ... you are dressed already? And Prust ...! Do you see? I was right. He's safely back. You feel hot. I bet you got a fever. Go to sleep, and you'll get better again. Innocence! Are you asleep, Innocence? Hello, Jasper ... You are spotted! Come ... if you dare. Come, Jasper it's nice and warm. Are you shy? Afraid of water? We won't touch you, will we Beatrice? Now it's my turn. I bet you cannot swim all the way to the pier. A piece of cake! Under the water. Here comes Jasper! - Ouch! - Do you enjoy yourself, Jasper Mealworm? - Let go of me! Shouldn't you show off for the girls? Tell them a new lying ghost story. - Darn, we had that fun! - Or did you find more girls? Let go of me. You are just a little skirt chaser. A skirt chaser. Help! The Witch's Claw! He will drown! For you, life has much more to give, and you will make other people happy. And when you get old and sick ... death comes as a liberator. Where is Prust? I have to find him. We've been petrified of fear! We thought you had drowned. You are alive. That’s what matters. Where is Prust? - He's at home. - The boy is safe! Thanks everyone! Come ... let's go home, to him. There, Prust. I think you're sick. This will help. If you suffer from it, you might die of grief. Maybe we should help him. - We have ... - We have let the air out on lots of cats. It's done in no time. Nobody must let the air out of you. That's a promise. Aron, it's I, Jasper. I have a problem. If you guess on Prust, you’re right. Hear for yourself. I know you cannot be of much help, when you are dead and want to be left alone. I just wanted to tell you. Innocence, Prust is ... sick. Look Prust! I did it all by myself! Look! There, Prust, let's quietly wait for Innocence. Quietly. I ... I ... could have ... - What did you do in there? - It's only Prust and me. - And now it's all ruined! - Do you realize that could have ... - How did you get in? - I just did. Darn! You really gave me a shock. What about Prust and me? I tell you, that Prust can decide when he shall die. - He has the right to. - Of course. Of course Prust can decide that himself. That's a promise. Go to sleep now, Prust ... so you might feel better. - Good morning. - I don't go to school today ... because Prust ... Of course you do. You're all go on an excursion today. I can't leave Prust all alone. What if ... if ... mom and I took care of Prust at work. He can be in the car. Do we have a deal? Off you go, Jasper. Now the nannies will take over. There you are, Jasper. We are in a bit of a hurry. - Come on, Jasper. - Don't wait for that sissy. Maurids! Have a nice day! - Look after Prust. - We will. We go in a line, not abreast all of you! Oh look! They're fucking! Jasper and Beatrice, for how long will you lie there, if I may ask? Thank you. Well, Jesper Mealworm, we had to go to this shit museum, and listen to all this crap because of your lousy beer can opener. Dame’s behind! Did I ever claim what it is? - Do you know, Maurids? - It is a beer can opener, and Hell, Jasper goes in the stream afterwards. But if it really is an old object, then you will be thrown in the stream. Right, Maurids? Maurids must do that ... at the Witch's Claw! - A bet, yes! - Yes, Maurids. That's OK with me. But you can count on that it is the Mealworm who will be ‘baptized’. Don't linger, children. Be attentive! - Come! Who found it? - He did ... Jasper found it. - Small but agile! So, your name is Jasper. The museum will give you a gift, as a reward. Take this, and thank you very much. Maurids in the water! Maurids in the water! Maurids in the water! You're all bullies! Shove him in! Such a find is as noble as a knightly tournament! It renders glory to our school. Maurids in the water! Maurids in the water! Maurids in the water ...! That's enough, do you hear me? Maurids! - I cannot swim! - Try to get closer! Maurids, come here, come closer! Help! Help! -Maurids, just a second! Hold it, Maurids! - Hold on to it! - Sombody help! Hurry! Thorkild, you help them! Get the swimming pole! I am stuck. Hurry, Thorkild! We will get you, Maurids. Guide the pole, Jasper. We’ve got him! Here he is. A little bit more. Oh no! Bloody hell! Be careful! Innocence! - So you have come for him now? - Yes. Now we leave, Jasper. His time has come. First Aron, and then you with Prust. Does it have to be like that? Will he go to the unknown? Young friend, we are all ... a part of the eternity. Happy journey, Innocence. Give my greetings to Aron ... and take good care of Prust. Good bye, Jasper. I'm proud of you. Jasper ... there is something ... - You mustn't ... - It was not our fault. Prust is dead. We should not feel sad. Ar... Innocent have taken him to the unknown, to Aron. The St Hans bonfire is not yet lit ... if you'd like to watch it? "Begone all witches. Begone all trolls," "in this loveliest evening of summer." Generation after generation has driven off the evil by the power of the bonfire. The power of the bonfire symbolizes the power of the good; this never ending fight against the evil. this never ending invocation! "Begone all witches. Begone all trolls." There is one person among us, who has done a great deed today, who saved our son Maurids from the evil, the furniture remover's son, Jasper. For this deed, my wife and I would like to give him a gift. Now, let us all sing Drachmann's beautiful Midsummer Song. "We love our land, when Christmas is here and ..." - Won't you have a look? "lits the Christmas tree star, and a glare in my eye," "when in spring every bird, over land over sea," "make all voices with greeting-trills sing." "We sing and we praise on the road, in the streets," Oh, you sweet tiny tot. " ... when all the crops is safely harvested;" "but the loveliest wreath ..." I don't care if you’re an offspring of the Holy Cat, Prust is still your father. That's something you should be proud of. I baptize you in water from Aron’s stream to Little Prust. And please consider, that you have a father, that dwells among the unknown. That isn't too bad, is it? They are our friends! - Oh, how cute it is! - Do you want to hold him? We can both hold him. He takes after his father ... although brand new. Subtitles by Aliquis.
