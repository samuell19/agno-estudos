She is Namiji, Dob?'s daughter I wiII approach her first You saw them? We've got enough - let's go We'll miss the best part Never mind the play. Did you lift enough purses? We paid to get in; let's have our money's worth The play's too slow for me That Yukinojo is creepy - he's neither man nor woman She's wonderful. ls she married? Her husband would need to be born under a lucky star Based on the novel by Otokichi Mikami Photographed by Setsuo Kobayashi. Directed by Kon lchikawa l can't bear the way our actors are so proud They always scoff at any outsiders, however good But this visiting troupe were just strolling players... ...until their Osaka success He's so handsome; it makes me feel funny Take any of our actors in Edo... ...they can't match Yukinojo And they're so high and mighty l'm supporting this visiting troupe What are you talking about? You never go to the theatre Yes, l do You're a fine one You've fallen for this troupe An Edo man always helps the weak Let's leave him to his ignorance -What about me? -You can go home l want to see if Yukinojo is really good You don't want to be left out Stop talking and go in You're a lot of idiots in Edo l don't know why these people waste money on plays They complain enough about the price of rice lt's always the same when times are hard The theatre was doing badly, so they invited Yukinojo's troupe They came to Edo from Osaka Listen to the expert Hard times produce good thieves, too There are many about now, but you're the best, of course Then Yamitaro, the Kid, Oryu, Otoki... ...Shime, Hoin, Sumi?, Chim? and Densuk? All first-class thieves There's Hirutaro, too Never heard of him Yamitaro's about the only match for me Let's see what you've got ldiot! l told you to dump the purses at once Get rid of them. l don't want people to think l'm a thief She's not exactly charming She could be, though Maybe love would make her a little more feminine l thought this might prove useful to your plan l'm sorry l cannot help you openly Master! All your enemies are together Your late father must be helping you here They are all in Edo Congratulations. You are a master You have the finest Kabuki troupe in Japan We are happy to be in Edo Your audience's reception has moved us close to tears Kawaguchiya enjoyed the performance very much He would like to honour you... ...by introducing you to Lord Dob?, and his daughter They are very important guests l hope you will agree to meet them; it would be good for our theatre Unfortunately, l have a bad headache Please give him my apologies l'm sure he will be very disappointed But you must be tired. Please rest Why should you refuse to drink with your enemies? You must grasp every opportunity Learn all about them Gain their confidence, then get your revenge This time l felt afraid of myself Something told me to refuse them l am sure this is the right thing to do Now l think they will play into my hands This is the way, l am sure of it We should not have walked My breath of fresh air has resulted in us getting lost Why attack me? l'm only an actor from the theatre l know you Wait a moment Why, Heima? You have said that our school of swordsmanship has no secrets We must learn for ourselves Why show him the scroll? Yukinojo studies here, but he's an outsider lt's not fair l'm young, but l am the assistant instructor here l should have this honour You can see it if you want to But your impatience tells against you Your very impatience prohibits your initiation The honour goes to Yukinojo lt was only blank paper Blank paper? A warning... against vanity and pride Once we master an art and become famous... ...we tend to forget our resolutions Words cannot explain the mysteries of an art l merely wanted you to perceive my innermost mind Heima can go He has lost his teacher and his friends... ...and he has gained nothing Yes, we know Heima Kadokura l left Osaka because of you l came to live in Edo, and now l hear your name everywhere here l won't stand for it You have caused our teacher much anguish You and l studied together like brothers... Actor! Don't call me brother You won't get away with this l'm sorry l butted in without an introduction Thank you for saving me, although you are a stranger For an actor, you're a strong swordsman l felt as though l had the theatre to myself But you faltered at the most important moment l heard the name Heima Kadokura; do you know him? No, l was attacked without warning Strange... he was too skilful for an ordinary robber You're probably afraid of me, too Why not? Decent people don't hang around the streets at night l wonder if he was an ordinary robber? There are many masterless samurai about Better not walk alone at night dressed up like that Anyway, here comes a carriage May l know your name? Yamitaro! We've got you trapped Don't let him get away this time He must be around here somewhere Are you an actor? Well, it's dangerous around here at night Thank you Where is he? Here l am You're not Yamitaro l'm Hirutaro Keep out of it We're out for bigger game l am big game. l'm a famous thief Why is Yamitaro so popular? A wonderful ruby lt really is the colour of blood Who is it? Kawaguchiya is here Let him wait How is Lady Namiji's health? What is it to you? At the theatre you noticed how she fell in love with Yukinojo Now you want to bring them together and gain her confidence You want her to curry favour for you with the Shogun Do you think l don't know that? lt isn't that at all The doctor says she's depressed So l asked permission for her to rest at home for a month But l think she's lovesick, and it's all your fault Not at all lt's all your fault. Everything l told you to bring Yukinojo. Bring him here at once He's much too common for my daughter Let her meet him a few times She'll soon tire of him, and that will be that Yukinojo is very rude; he has refused all our invitations l'll bring him tomorrow, even if l have to carry him here Because of Namiji, the Shogun does what l say She's important to me Stop intriguing, or you will be the one to get hurt The Shogun is a cold-hearted man l may be powerful, but the Shogunate is inflexible Even my influence cannot help merchants like you Let's forget the past Greed has its attractions, and also its limitations Don't become obsessed with your selfishness l hear you're buying rice Very well, buy it all up; l'll do what l can for you l would be most grateful for any kindnesses l'm sorry l kept you waiting Actors are so temperamental He accepts your invitation Why have you accepted now? l have been waiting for this This is an invitation to visit Dob?'s house A special invitation to visit his ailing daughter, Lady Namiji To visit... ...Lady Namiji This is far enough; l'll work here tonight l can smell the gold already lt certainly is a fine mansion So this is the famous home of Lord Dob? His treasure house must be full of gifts from the Shogun And full of bribes he took when he was a magistrate l'll help the poor again tonight; a little more than usual Winter is coming, and many are poorly clothed A visitor at this hour? There is no need to be so formal The Lady Namiji herself wishes to thank you for your visit She is waiting in her room Oh, no, l am already too overwhelmed by meeting Lord Dob? l will take my leave now You must see her. She is ill; please do as she wishes What did he say to you when l was not present? Nothing Not a single word? lt was rather frightening He's proud because of the Shogun's interest in Namiji Be sympathetic towards her. lf you capture her heart... What do you mean? How can l even aspire to? Her mind is made up already; you can win her easily Her words count most at the Castle, not Dob?'s You won't know about business... ...but l'll stake my utmost hopes on you ln return, l'll look after you all your life You actors live a precarious existence lt would be wise to think of your future We have met for the first time, yet he hoIds me in contempt He thinks an actor is some sort of prostitute He thinks he can purchase me to beguiIe a Iady for him He is the embodiment of vuIgarlty Does he intend to use me to get rld of Dob?? What you say is very true Your words have made me extremely happy l am highly honoured by your interest in me l feel as if l were in heaven l shall do my very best to please the young lady As l thought, you understand things quickly But this must be a secret between you, me and Lady Namiji You mustn't forget that Poor Iady, she reaIIy has faIIen in Iove with me Please be at ease l apologize for receiving you in such an untidy room To be with a lady who has attained the heights of glory... ...to be able to enjoy her favour, even for a few moments... You make it sound as though l am happy to serve the Shogun What greater happiness could there be? Every woman in Japan must envy you such eminence... Are you mocking me? lf l have unwittingly offended My Lady... ...it is best that l take my leave No, l apologize if l have offended you... ...but l am hurt by your reserve No one seems to know the nature of my illness... ...but l think that you understand You have posed a very delicate question, My Lady An excess of love, perhaps Do you think l like my service at the Castle? You do not know what the Shogun is like My illness began when first l saw you Your words sound very sweet to me l am a simple man and apt to believe what you say l beg you not to mock me l have cast aside modesty, reputation, pride... Dreams are superficial l know now that there is a daytime love... ...deeper than the love of night lf you really mean that... ...l will do anything, even forsake my beloved stage for you But if it is nothing but infatuation, you leave me no choice l must die You understand my love. l am so happy How can I bear to teII such Iies? But I shaII have to teII many more Iies... ...aIthough this poor girl is innocent of any crlme This is Lord Dob?'s house; even the Shogun is afraid of him We'll lose our heads if we're caught Let's go and find somewhere else to rob Shut up, Muku! l'd need a hundred heads to answer for what l've stolen lt would be a disgrace if someone beat us to this You can go home and get sake ready Don't you need me? You'll only get in the way The best of luck, then Someone is outside Better go back to bed if you know what's good for you Who is out there? Just my luck! lt's only me Do you live here? You keep out of this You're strong... you're a man! Be quiet, or someone else will come Who are you, dressed up like that? You're from the theatre Never mind that A burglar. He ran when l shouted at him You must be careful; l would be grieved if you were injured lt is difficult to leave you, but l must go now l have many obligations and duties... ...to the theatre and to my master That's too bad, but what an actor He rang down the curtain in fine style Why did that crook Ohatsu have to come breaking in? lt's funny, but l'm beginning to like Yukinojo He seems to be more than an ordinary actor But why does he humble himself to Dob?? And to the Shogun's Namiji? lt looks as though he has his reasons for all this lt still hurts He's given me a great big bruise You'd never guess his strength to look at his face He grabbed my wrist when l had a dagger And yet he let me get away That face, that strength... what a strange man He really has upset me But who could love such a half-man, half-woman? l hate him See what l'll do to him l won't rob Dob?, l'll rob Yukinojo - of his most precious thing Find out where he lives. Jump to it! Master, l am back l want to talk to you l understand l know why you have refused their invitation so many times You were waiting for the right moment So l said nothing But this person you visit every night, who is she? She is the Shogun's mistress; she is said to be the most beautiful You are infatuated. Will you let this turn you from your purpose? Have you forgotten your revenge? Master, why speak to me like this? l am in torment when l visit that house The wine l drink seems like molten lead Understand what l suffer, what l endure Master, must l do all this? Must my revenge be like this? What are you saying? Who drove your father to madness? Who drove your mother to suicide? l will remind you lt was Dob?, in company with Kawaguchiya and Hiromiya They worked together in Nagasaki, they ruined your father They set out to destroy your respected merchant family They were merciless Your father lived in the slums, a broken man You were a motherless child of seven when l first knew you l was young, too, living in the same poor slum One cold and rainy night... ...your father hanged himself When l returned from the theatre... ...l found you clinging to his legs, crying l promised l swore to help you avenge your father... ...even though it took my whole life At last we are in Edo with them Why hesitate? Why not run them through at once? Running them through is not enough They should be roasted... ...boiled in oil My parents will not be avenged... ...unless these men are tortured until they become mad Terrible words Yes, terrible l am the lover of Lord Dob?'s daughter She is now completely mine Sooner or later she will abandon the Shogun for me Dob? will be shamed. Then he will fall into a living hell Master, when l think about this terrible revenge... ...l feel l want to leave it undone and run away l heard someone Probably the inn cat l have been away on business; how unfortunate for me l would have been delighted to be your first patron l know quality when l see it l'm the sort who respects the best people... ...be they lords or pickpockets That's why l invited you to my home without hesitation One doesn't entertain the best people in restaurants Thank you for calling so soon lt's said l'm one of Edo's richest merchants... ...but don't be overawed by that l'm just a simple man with a wide circle of friends l hear that you have other acquaintances in Edo: Lord Dob? and Kawaguchiya How very extraordinary Unlike myself, they are both very cautious, reserved men They are usually very suspicious of strangers Why should they make an exception? What is the reason, l wonder? No doubt they are laughing at me behind my back No, not at all Dob?, Kawaguchiya and l have been friends a long time l have no qualms; we're like one family, really But l wonder what they said Nothing about you. l heard of you from others What have you heard? What an unusual clock lt came from abroad Did you obtain it in Nagasaki? How did you know l lived in Nagasaki? l hear that Nagasaki is something of a treasure house Many rare articles can be found there Kawaguchiya and l were born in Nagasaki So l guessed rightly about the clock To come back to what we were saying What was it you heard about me? Tell me Just snatches of conversation; l cannot remember exactly You must tell me Will you be offended? No, of course not They said you are only interested in quick returns They said you lack foresight Who said that? Officials at the Castle l heard it when l was there the other day What else did they say? They said that you plan to expand your trade They said that you are beginning to hoard a lot of rice They said that, too? This year's rice harvest is poor and prices are high lf you were a loyal merchant, you would bring your rice to Edo... ...and use it to force prices down Rich and poor alike would sing your praises King of the rice market A popular figure, an influential man in Edo That is what they said l see what they mean Shogunate officials are very far-seeing Do you think so? Surely you would lose a lot of money You wouldn't understand such matters l'm grateful for this information l've been away on business - buying rice, in fact Have you told anyone else what they said? Not all actors are great gossips l didn't mean that at all l meant, did you tell Lord Dob? or Kawaguchiya? There was no mention of them at the Castle So, naturally, l told them nothing l didn't mean to offend you. Accept my apologies He rose to the bait ''We're Iike one famiIy'', he says But in fact he pIans to deceive them He knows very weII what Kawaguchiya is doing... ...hoarding rlce, too Their onIy bond is greed Even waIIs have ears It is wisest never to speak of secrets, even in prlvate I have something to teII you I wiII be waiting for you in the park at ten o'cIock A woman you know lf he ignores me, l'll make him regret it l'm most grateful for your letter l am Yukinojo, an actor in the troupe from Osaka Save your breath We're not strangers. Look at this bruise you gave me You nearly twisted my arm off l'm the thief you caught, and you won't get rid of me now l've fallen in love with you Don't be so surprised. l may be a thief, but l'm a woman, too l've never known love before Pity me and hold me tight, just once l am very flattered by your words... Don't try my patience. l never know when l might be arrested l haven't got time to waste; let's go to an inn now l have no reason to dislike you... ...but l have vowed to touch no woman... ...until l have fulfilled an obligation The revenge you've staked your life on? ls that it? Why so surprised? You came here because of my letter One word from me... ...and your revenge and very life will be in danger Let's not be enemies lf you do as l ask, l'll help you to get revenge Those three old men won't have a chance... ...if we two join forces lf you know so much... You're going to kill me? You want to shut my mouth? That's a laugh l can be a saint, or a demon l love you, so l offered to help you All right, just see what l'll do l'll go to Dob? and say that Yukinojo... Keep away, or l'll kill you You won't escape A ruffian's after me l must talk to her Talk? With a dagger? What a woman! lt's not a woman Yuki, we meet again Heima Kadokura Edo is not such a big place. l'll finish you l must find her. Let me go lf you don't, l won't hold back this time Who is he? An actor? Whatever it's about, l'll help Kadokura What's the matter? Afraid? What are you waiting for? You samurai are always boasting Afraid of an actor? This is more exciting than stage swordplay What a pity. This may be his very last performance Oh dear! l seem to have lost her He won't find me in a hurry There's a fine moon tonight, Ohatsu Yamitaro What a place to meet l enjoyed watching your love scene Oh, no! Did you see that? Me and him... you know, that actor... ...we're strangers, but l admire him in many ways That face, that strength... l understand your feelings l understand why you, a man-hater, love him so much When l heard you talk about his enemies... ...it made things clear to me He's fighting powerful enemies, alone lt makes one want to help him, if possible lf l were a man, l might talk of help... ...sympathy with his cause, and so on But l'm afraid l happen to be a woman Well, let me tell you something: leave him alone Who do you think you are? Don't you know that love is the dearest thing in a woman's life? Are you going to be stubborn? l can't give him up Very well, acrobat Ohatsu. We will have to be enemies We're in the middle of a river, with only the moon as witness Even an acrobat can't escape Yes, she can - she knows how to swim There was famine in the Iand... ...caused by coId, drought, fire and flood In 1836, the starving peopIe rebeIIed They rose against a weak Shogunate and corrupt merchants lt is so painful not to see you... ...l almost wished we had never met l have missed you just as much But l dare not come here too often But l must see you... ...even though it hurts me not to be able to visit you openly Then l shall leave this house l am certain of one thing Many women must have fallen in love with you Yet, from them all you have chosen me l don't want to make you sad l don't want anything to hurt you l would rather die than return to the Castle You are so good My father wants me to return to the Castle Because of all these riots... ...he is going to employ more guards lt may be easier if l escape now Lady Namiji... l cannot bear us to act like strangers any more l wish to be your wife l do not deserve so great an honour Lady Namiji, there can be no one else for me You will be the only woman in my life So many presents from Hiromiya You have been so generous with presents for our entire company Please do not mention it l thought that you would like the clock; l saw how you admired it Do you remember how it chimed that day you visited me? lt is a priceless gift, but l have done nothing to deserve it lndeed you have Do you remember the information you gave me? About the rice? l took action. l brought the rice here and put it on sale Other merchants followed my example Because of this, the riots came to an end The poor had enough to eat The Shogun has praised me, people respect me l'm a popular man in Edo, almost as popular as you You are a courageous businessman No, l bought the rice cheaply from the farmers themselves l couldn't lose on the deal Hiromiya, l've caught you at last Kawaguchiya, why all this fuss? For business, come to my store You always pretend to be out. You've deceived me Deceived you? How is that? You know very well You knew l was trying to control the rice market Then you sold rice at give-away prices l'm ruined l'm sorry to hear that Weren't we business associates? Business is just like war, Kawaguchiya Relatives can become enemies The rice trade is not for you lt's for big merchants, not jumped-up clerks like you Hiromiya, l beg you to help me Please help Why not ask Lord Dob?? You know very well he's not the type to give any help He might, though. We've been friends since Nagasaki days He wouldn't let you down Let me in. l have an urgent message from Lord Dob? Hiromiya, give me some water lt's been a long time. Have you forgotten me? l am Matsuuraya Your former master, now wandering in hell You were an orphan l raised you, made you my clerk, but you were ungrateful You went over to Hiromiya, my competitor Together you conspired to ruin my business You forced me to leave my ancestral home Forgive me! Hang yourself and die Hang yourself, as l did Become mad, as l did A man like you should never have been born You killed Hiromiya's clerk You burned Hiromiya's store You cannot escape falling into the bottomless pit Kawaguchiya Spare me, Matsuuraya Don't stare at me like that l wasn't the only one lt was Hiromiya's idea He bribed Lord Dob? to rule against you You burn my house and now you blurt out everything You're raving mad l should have kept you gagged l've killed him! l've killed a man! l didn't expect that An actor's revenge, dramatic as a play One's taken care of, but it's not easy for the actor He's not happy in the role See how lonely he looks now Revenge is difficult, even for him Poor man I was Iocked up in the house, but I managed to escape I am hiding in the home of my oId nurse... ...near the Dentsuin TempIe The messenger is her son; you can trust him He wiII show you the way to the house I wait for you. Namiji l do not understand this letter at all ls the messenger here? Tell him that Give him this money for a carriage and send him home Although l have retired, l am still allowed to visit the Castle The Shogunate officials pay me respect l owe this to the trust you place in me, My Lord l am sure my abilities are unworthy of such esteem l am very grateful and l cherish the honour l would never lie to you about Lady Namiji l do not know who has started these rumours lt is true that Lady Namiji is ill She remains at my house But now she is feeling much better She has spoken of returning to the Castle in a few days... ln a few days? Very well Money from Yamitaro Two lots today No, one's from me Always Yamitaro He gets all the credit But wait and see. He can't provide for everybody My chance will come soon You said you were taking me to Yukinojo Drawing a dagger? You'd better put that away Hide where you like They'll leave no stone unturned to find you You won't escape l said l'd help you, so why don't you trust me? Who do you think l am? And who do you think you are? Yesterday you ceased to be the Shogun's lady You were foolish enough to love an actor So you might spare a gentle word for me Or is that too hard for you? Don't defy me. l've killed one man already - l fear no one l killed Kawaguchiya l was keeping him a prisoner... ...to protect Lord Dob? and myself Now Dob? says it was merely a quarrel between commoners... ...and refuses to help me He made use of me in the past... ...and now he abandons me just as l've become famous Very well, if l am going to be cast down... ...l'm taking his dearest treasure with me l found you before Lord Dob?'s men did. l won't let you go You again? You're very persevering Let me go, Heima. l have no quarrel with you You won't escape alive this time Someone's given me orders to kill you A strange coincidence. lt's my fate to be your enemy So now you are a hired killer? Who hired you for this? Lord Dob? Then tell me one thing, if you know it For what reason does Lord Dob? wish me dead? How should l know? Does he think that l kidnapped Lady Namiji? Lady Namiji? He didn't mention her Why, then? He's suspicious of you and wants you out of the way Suspicious? When l told him that we had studied together in Osaka... ...he said that explained all Explained? Suspicious? What does it all mean? lf Dob? has found me out, my plans are ruined There is no hope; my good luck has run out This must mean that the gods forbid me to take revenge Father... mother... ...please forgive Yukinojo He has failed in his duty l can't kill you You've won again l fled Osaka because of you. Must l flee from Edo, too? There is no peace for me while you are alive The gods have not forsaken me l left my fate to your sword, but the gods saved me Don't be so rough She's the most beautiful girl l've seen for a long time Where did you find her? The dogs were barking at her lt's a good thing you brought her to me She'll be sold later, so treat her gently Shut up, we'll do what we like with her Stop making such a row at night Go outside, l'm trying to get some sleep You're a tough priest What are you doing? Taking her back wherever she came from She's my treasure. You can't have her What's here is mine Take her and l'll tell that you're really Hoin, the escaped convict l'm sorry, but you'll have to shut up for a bit She's really beautiful She shouldn't walk alone at night Anyone would be tempted to kidnap her lt's hard being a priest l must control the desires of the flesh l'm in bed; come back tomorrow lt's me: Hoin You know l won't allow any females in my house Not even cats Now listen, you've got to help with this girl l think she has a fever All she says is something like Yuki That's all she says l remember you There's no time to explain; you must come to my house at once l have heard many things about you You are a generous man You rob in order to help the poor You saved my life, l trust you, but... Namiji may be dying l think l know all about your revenge Now just listen to me l somehow feel as though you are my brother You may think it strange, but it's true l'm an outlaw, so l can't go anywhere l like Otherwise l'd help your vengeance So l ought not to care about Lady Namiji... ...it doesn't matter whether she lives or dies But l feel sorry for her No, she's not exactly ill; she says she killed a man tonight She said it was Hiromiya Hiromiya wanted to revenge himself on Lord Dob? He got his deserts. Now two of them are taken care of But she understands nothing of all this She's done something beyond her comprehension Her mind has suffered; it is like a string about to snap ln her delirium, she keeps calling for you Very well, l will come with you She's dying Has anyone returned? Not yet, My Lord l thought she'd die any minute Please say something to her Your words may save her You kept your promise to me l am happy Gone, after all? Namiji... you were completely innocent Life was unkind to you You were born to be betrayed A victim of your father's greed A victim of my own revenge You have died without having known true love Not truly loved by anyone lf there is a next world... ...l will try to make good my false promises My vow may yet become true and l will marry you l will never leave you l will always serve you We will be together Lady Namiji, please do not hate me Please go in peace Yukinojo wishes to see you What is it? l came to thank you for last night The assassin Who are you? Why do you hold me your enemy? You are mistaken Do you think l am blind? Do you remember your first visit here? Afterwards, l sent a man to Osaka You studied under Koken; your sword-master was lsshosai Your stage debut was at the age of twelve That much l discovered, but no more Lord Dob?, former magistrate of Nagasaki... ...do you recall another face which resembled mine? What? Nagasaki? You know Nagasaki? The Lady Namiji She is outside A priest brought her here, but said nothing Drink lt is a Dutch poison One tablet brings unconsciousness. Two, death Namiji has returned... dead You as good as killed her lt means that you have killed me, too l don't care who you really are You have made me lose my power You must not live Matsuura's wife... of Nagasaki You know me now? Do l not resemble my mother? l am her only son She named me Yukitaro You forced my mother to succumb to you You promised her that you would save our family You made her suffer She cut her throat Thus my mother died Forgive me Now l understand There were three of us in the Nagasaki group ln one month we have been ruined Was it your revenge, Yukinojo? You must be happier now Today's performance was magnificent You may go now Only two days more in the theatre We may never act together again l cannot imagine the future Do not speak of it lt was to avenge your parents... ...you caused these deaths and that of innocent Lady Namiji l understand now why you wish to retire... ...to hide from others But you were my hope, l depended on you l know, and l would like to stay with you Was l at fault? lt was my vow lf l had not sworn to avenge your father... ...nothing would have happened You were not wrong; you could never be at fault l made you do it No, l must leave without repaying my debt to you Forgive me l believe it must be my fate to be alone l was born under a lonely moon Somesake? Well, if you insist Still, l must admit that Yuki is a fine man His eyes send shivers through me When did he look at you? Quiet, oaf! Oaf again? But you astonished me that time You stood there aiming that pistol. l thought you'd kill him You made me angry that night when l jumped into the river And l caught a dreadful cold l may have been a swimmer once, but l'm not so young now lt was a shock. So l've thought things over; l'm going to settle down She's become very ladylike lately That's fine l've just noticed something ln profile, your face is rather like Yukinojo's You can't see the wood for the trees; l should have settled for you No women for me! l want to be your wife You'll never reform and be a decent, ordinary woman Are you going straight? l'm tired of this life Maybe l'll go to Osaka with Yukinojo's theatre l'll come along, too What about me? Splendid! lf they both leave Edo, l'll have the place to myself After their great success in Edo... ...Kukinojo's troupe returned to Osaka But Yukinojo was not with them Many peopIe sought him... ...the greatest of femaIe impersonators Yamitaro searched for him... Ohatsu searched for him... But no one ever saw Yukinojo again One rumour said he became a prlest Another that he had joined a tourlng theatrlcaI company In time, rumours ceased and peopIe forgot about Yukinojo Had he reaIIy disappeared beyond the windswept pIain? Who was it who remembered the story of Yukinojo? Was it Yamitaro? Or Kukinojo? Or was it Ohatsu?
