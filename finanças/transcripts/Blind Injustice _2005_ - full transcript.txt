(somber music) - [Man] And so we congratulate this year's winner of the Williamsburg Award, Miss Diana Scott. (applause) - I'm so grateful for this award. I wish to thank the law school faculty and staff for their consideration and love. And I wish to thank my aunt and mentor Joanna Bartlett for everything she's done to help make this possible. I wish my parents were still alive to be with me here on this day to share this wonderful event. A dozen red roses. And my favorite song playing. And with the perfect meal. (ominous music) No, Tina. No, don't be silly. (laughing) Alex, no, no, he's not home yet. But he should be home soon. (kettle whistling) Oh Alex had his interview today. Oh that big accounting firm, yeah. I know, we're both hoping that he gets the job. It would be great. I know. Yeah, but he's so good at what he does, he's, No. Yeah. (laughing) Oh, thank you. She's more excited than I am. I'm gonna be starting at her office next week while I study for the bar exam, mhmm. Yeah. Alex is the best, are you kidding me? Uh, speak of the devil. I'm gonna call you tomorrow. Okay, I gotta go, bye. Alex. Hey, don't track any mud inside. I think it rained earlier. Hey, baby. Alex? Hmm. (ominous music) (banging) Back door there, huh? Hey, honey. (glass shattering) (gasping) Who is that? Who are you? What do you want? - [Man] Shut up. - Get out of my house! Help me! Get out! - [Man] Shut up, or I'll kill you! - Oh god, no. (clothes ripping) (whimpering and shouting) (man grunting) (bashing) (whimpering) - It's okay, it's okay, baby. Calm down, it's all right, it's all right. It's okay. You're just having a bad dream. - I hit you. - Shh, shh, no big deal. Should start wearing a football helmet to bed. - I can't even get any peace in my sleep. - That son of a bitch. Listen. They're gonna find this guy and we'll put him away. However long it takes. I'm gonna be here for you. Now come on. Come on. Come on, let's go. Come on, it's okay. - On August 11th at approximately 7:30 p.m., Diana Scott was sexually assaulted in her apartment. Description of the rapist matched Malcolm Humphries, a groundskeeper at the university. - So he must have seen her on campus. - Yeah, exactly. About 95% of all rapists are familiar with their victims. - And what about the DNA tests? - They were inconclusive, they'll be thrown out. But, hopefully we won't need them. We've got a lot of circumstantial evidence and a good witness. Hi. - She's blind? How are we supposed to? - Perform a lineup? I'm blind, I'm not deaf, officer. - Pay attention and lock this up. All right, are you ready? - Yes. - All right, take my arm. - Can you hold this, Alex? - Of course, of course. - Okay. - I'll be here. (buzzing) - Not a sound from any of you. (tense music) Eyes front, number three! - I need somebody here, please. - Let me take you to the bathroom. - Diana! - Alex, no. - Take me to a sink, please. - To your right, to your right. - Oh god. - Hey. When I saw my attacker standing in line up with that sick smile on his face, I didn't even make it to the bathroom. You're doing good. - Oh god, I thought I could handle this. - You're doing good. (sobbing) Hey, he's locked up, right, right? - Hey, honey, you okay? - I don't know. Yeah, I'm fine. - Detective, can I take her home now? - We have some paperwork to fill out. It could take a while. - That's fine, I'll wait. - Alex, why don't you go home? - Okay. Call me and I'll pick you up. Oh, here's your bag. - Thank you. - Hon, I thought you were gonna call me when you're done. - I took a cab. Just, I needed to be alone. They arrested him. - That's fantastic. I mean, that's good, right? - Yeah. - God I wish I had just five minutes alone with that mother, - Alex, Alex, please, that's not helping. - Sorry. It's just that when I think of what that sick son of a bitch did to you I wanna tear his heart out. - Honey, what part of it's not helping didn't you get? - Sorry, I'll shut up. - Thanks. Going beef, huh? - Yeah. Orange chicken and shrimp fried rice and a beautiful bottle of wine. (cork popping) - I'm really not hungry. - Right, are you sure? It's from your favorite place. - I can't eat. - Well you're gonna make me eat all this by myself? - I can't eat, Alex. - I'm really sorry, baby. - Alex, honey. - I'm not the enemy, D. I'm just trying to help you. - You know you can help me by just giving me some space? - You know maybe you should see someone. You know, get a therapist to talk to. - What for? - I just, I mean about all the nightmares. - Babe, I'm sorry about your eye. - No, no, no, it's not, don't be silly, it's got nothing to do with my eye. It's just that, you keep pushing me away. - And you're thinking a therapist is gonna help that. - I just want my girl back. - I have to go lay down now. - Hey, thanks for meeting me. Hi, Alex. - No problem. - Hi, Susan. - You know Alex, I really need to speak with Diana alone. - Yeah, well. I'd like to stay. - Alex. - Hey, look, I'm your fiancee. I thought we were in this thing together. - Yeah. Alex, please, for me. - Fine. Whatever you say. - Thanks. How's he handling all this? - I don't know, he's, sometimes you think he was a victim. - Yeah, that's not unusual. - [Dianne] Really? - Yeah, often in situations like these, boyfriends or husbands feel somehow emasculated. After I was raped, my now ex husband wouldn't leave me alone. I mean not even for a minute. Right to the point where I couldn't take it anymore. I need a man, not an overprotective father. - Alex is not that bad. He's just, but thanks for the insight. - Hey, how's Fuller working out for you? - Greg. - Yeah, he's the best prosecutor we have. - He really knows his stuff. - Oh yeah. - Do they know who the defense attorney's gonna be? - Jillian Bianucci. - A woman? - Yeah, public defenders don't get to choose their cases. There's something else. Malcolm Humphries has pled not guilty and has demanded a jury trial. - A trial? - Yeah he swears he's innocent. And here's the best part. He says God is the only witness he'll need. - That's a subpoena I'd like to see. - Yeah. Diana. I really want you to be careful in there. You know, there's no telling what Bianucci'll say or do. She's really not a very good lawyer. She's a wildcard. She'll try anything. - Is it true that he used to work at my school? - Yeah. Statistically, it fits the profile perfectly. - He could have been watching me at any time. (ominous music) Just to think I could just have been standing there right next to him while he was stalking me. He makes me sick. You're gonna be at the trial, right? - Absolutely. (somber music) - [Judge] Court is now in session. (gavel banging) - Miss Scott. Would you please take us back to the evening of August 11th? - Yes sir. It was 7:30 and I was on the phone with my friend Tina. And I heard a noise outside so I hung up the phone. And I went to the front door, I thought it was Alex, my fiancee. There was nobody there. I heard the noise coming from the back of the house so I, I walked to the back of the house. - But it wasn't Alex, was it? Take your time, Miss Scott. We know this isn't easy for you. - And then I heard the glass break. And he came into my house. Trying to defend myself, I picked up a glass and I threw it at him. Then I had a knife to my throat. And he said that, he said shut up or I'll kill you. - Shut up or I'll kill you. That's what he said? My god, you must have been terrified. - Terrified doesn't describe it. I thought he was gonna kill me. - I know this is difficult, Miss Scott. But you're doing just fine. Now, to the best of your recollection, could you tell us what happened next? - He dragged me into my bedroom. And he threw me onto the bed and then he ripped my clothes off and he raped me repeatedly. - You know Miss Scott, I'm extremely impressed. I'm extremely impressed that in the middle of your terrifying attack, that you found time to touch your assailant's face. And not only that, you were able to identify him in a line of four other men that were almost identical. Now I find that pretty incredible. - What sighted people don't seem to understand is that when you're visually impaired or blind, your other senses are heightened. My sense of smell, my hearing. And my sense of touch are extremely acute. - I understand that, Miss Scott, under normal circumstances. But we're not talking about a casual encounter here. Now are we, Miss Scott? - No. No, what that man did to me was not a normal encounter. - I realize that your senses are heightened. But do you possibly think that you've made a mistake here and identified the wrong person, my client? - Objection. - Overruled. - Thank you, your honor. Is it possible, Miss Scott? Is it possible that maybe you smelled the wrong man, that maybe you heard the wrong man? That maybe you touched the wrong man? Is it possible, Miss Scott? Miss Scott, you're not sure, are you? - Yes I am. - You don't understand that there is a man's freedom at stake here. You clearly don't understand. Are you absolutely certain that-- - Yes I am! That is the man that raped me! That is him! - Your honor. - That is the man that raped me! (sobbing) That is him! That is him! - Your honor, I think we've seen quite enough. Must we torture the witness even further? - No, I quite agree. You may step down, Miss Scott. - Take my hand. There you go. - The court calls Malcolm Humphries. - You're gonna have to forgive me, Mr. Humphries. But I find your story hard to believe. As a matter of fact, you're gonna have to forgive me when I tell you that I don't believe anything you've told us within the last hour. The mud on your shoes was from a church picnic. The glass shards found on your gloves in your car were from when you volunteered to clean up a vacant lot. Mr. Humphries, do the jury and I look like complete idiots to you? - Objection! - Withdrawn. You were never at that church picnic. You never went to that vacant lot. But you did break into Diana Scott's apartment and you did rape her. I have nothing further. - May I say something, your honor? - Yes, you may. - You may take away my freedom and put me in jail. But with my faith in Jesus, justice will prevail. Let them look into my soul and let them see the real me. For when the light of heaven shines, the truth shall set me free. The truth shall set me free. - [Judge] Has the jury reached a verdict? - Yes they have, your honor. On the first count, the people versus Malcolm Humphries, breaking and entering. The jury finds Malcolm Humphries guilty. And on the second count, the people versus Malcolm Humphries, aggravated sexual assault, the people find Malcolm Humphries guilty. - Congratulations, justice is served. He's going away for a long time, don't worry. - I want you to take as much time as you need, okay? The job at the firm will be waiting for you whenever you're ready. - Okay, thank you. - Oh God, you did great. - Baby, congratulations, I love you. Let's go home. - Please take me home. - Let's go, let's go. (somber music) I thought you'd be asleep by now. - I've got a lot of reading before the bar exam. - Well, if you want me to go back in the living room, - No, don't be silly. It's your room too. Besides, I really have to talk with you. Can you sit down, please? - Yeah. Sure, babe. - Listen, I know that this really hasn't been easy on you. - Me? Yeah, don't be ridiculous. - Can you just not interrupt? I really need to say this. - Sorry, go ahead. - Look, I know that it's been frustrating for both of us for different reasons. And you, really, you've been wonderful. - Hey, what else am I gonna be? We're a team. - We are a team. That's why I'm really hoping that you can understand what I'm gonna say. - [Alex] What? - I really need to be alone. - Sure, okay, I'll just go back in the living room. - No, Alex, I mean, I mean alone alone. Look, I know that I've been pushing you away and that's frustrating. I just, I really just need some time to heal. Please understand. - Diana, if it's something about me touching you or something, it's not problem but, - Oh baby, it's more than that, believe me. I just think the best thing for both of us, for our relationship is if I can just work this out on my own for a while. - How long's a while? - I don't know. - [Alex] Goodnight, Diana. (prisoners shouting) (clanging) - [Man] 'Cause nobody cares about you! Don't you get it? (booming) - Head your shoulders. Put your hip in touch. Come on, listen to my voice. Find him, punch it. Come on, harder! Grab, strike drive. Good, one more. Grab, strike, drive. Good ,good, Grab, strike, drive. Good, one more. Grab, strike drive. That's it, all the way to the face. Grab, strike, drive. Kick to my voice. Push through it, kick to it. Now once you kick, put the foot down on the ground fast. Get out, there you go. Don't be afraid to reach out. That's it. Lay into it. Good, good, good. Grab, strike, drive. Good, next arm, grab, strike, drive. Good, one more. Grab, strike, drive. That's it. (bashing) One more, get back, come on! Okay Diana. That's good, that's good. You did a great job, great job. Great job, that's okay. Your technique is really improving, good job. (light music) - [Woman] Good morning, Diana. - Good morning, Mona. Do I have any messages? - There on your desk. - Oh thanks. - Also, Miss Bartlett said for you to go ahead and start on the Peterman case. - Two steps ahead of her. - And a young man called. Said he's an old friend of yours. He's in town on business and wanted to invite you out to dinner. A fellow named Alex Chase. He sounds pretty nice. - When did he call? - About an hour ago. Said he was making 7:00 reservations at Le Fontaine, a pretty fancy restaurant. Must have been some friend. - He was. - [Mona] Shall I accept? - Yes, absolutely. - Accepting what? If it's an offer from another firm, I'll double it. I want you to know how impressed I was with your presentation yesterday. It was brilliant. - Well thanks. I think Sanders will be stupid not to go with us. - Of course he would. Can you file these for me, Mona? - Sure. - Thanks. Now, what is it exactly that we're accepting, hmm? - Dinner with an old friend, Alex. - Alex Chase? How long has it been? - Five years. - Well, what do you say, maybe I should postpone our morning meeting ,hmm? - Cute. That's cute, don't do it. - Well let me know if you change your mind. - Is everything okay over here? Okay, wonderful. - It's great to see you. - Yeah. - I got you a glass of champagne. - Ooh, thank you. - A toast. - Why not, I'm not driving. - To old friends. - Who are you calling old? - Certainly not you. You look fantastic. Cheers. I'm so proud of you Diana, for everything you've accomplished. - Thanks, thanks. It really means a lot coming from you. And you, how's the wonderful world of accounting? - Oh yeah no, I, I left that a few years ago. I couldn't be chained to a desk. - Yeah. - But I'm in pharmaceutical sales now. I get to travel and, I get to work outside of the office. So it's great. - And what, what brought you here? - There was an opening for a sales rep in the Southeastern region of the company and so I took it. Along with hoping to catch up with you. I haven't even had time to find a place to live yet. I've really missed you, D. - I've really missed you too, Alex. Ooh. How's your mom and dad? - Oh, they're great, they're great. But they keep asking about you. - And photography, you still doing photography? - A little bit. - Good. - Oh, come to think of it, - I could do it. - Oh great. Would you mind taking a picture of us? - Oh Alex, don't. - Oh come on. You look beautiful. - I know, - Just smile. Thank you very much. - This is good champagne. - It's good, isn't it? - Yes, it's all good. - [Alex] I keep thinking about that time when we were drinking like said let's go for the moped ride and ended up getting lost on the golf course. - [Diana] Yeah, well directions were never really your strong suit. - [Alex] We had a lot of fun together, didn't we? - [Diana] Yeah, we sure did. - [Alex] Oh, I like it. - [Diana] Well thanks. Joanna helped me pick it out. - [Alex] Really? - [Diana] Yeah well, home sweet home. (light music) - Oh, it's nice. - Oh. - This place is so you. - Alex, you wanna come in for a drink? - I'd like to, but I can't. I've got this early morning flight to Atlanta. Sales meeting. But I had a wonderful time tonight, Diana. I hope we can do it again. - I would like that, Alex. - Good night, hon. - Good night.

Art, Ken, Rodriguez, Stone. - What's that? It's raisins partner? - I hope so. I stopped asking. - Those letters you been writing, man. You need to ask someone to send us some real food. This stuff's killing my skinny ass. - It's not what they're for. - Yeah how many times I gotta tell yo. No one cares. How many damn letters you write anyway? - I don't know, 70, 80. Lost track. - Let me ask you a question. What would you do if you found the guy? You know, the guy who really did it? What would that be worth to you? - Who cares, man, it ain't ever gonna happen. - Never say never, partner. And a carton of smokes says you're wrong. - Hey man, you got something to say to me why don't you just say it 'cause I don't got time for this shit. - Whoah, whoah, whoah, wrong again, inmate. All you got is time. And a whole lot of it, come on. You see that dude sitting at the far table across from the guy with the fro? - Yeah. - [Man] Word has it man's been talking about you. - So who the hell is he? - Anthony Davis. Name mean anything to you? - No, should it? - Well, he said the man's been bragging about you doing some of his time. Yeah, I think you should. - What? - He's been bragging at all the boys, man. About some shorty you raped five years ago. College chick. A blind chick. - For real? Are you sure about this? - Heard it myself. - Son of a bitch. - Hold it, you crazy, white boy? - Get your hands off! - Use your head, man. This ain't the time or the place. Besides, that knife ain't going nowhere. You just keep it together man, think. - I am thinking. I'm thinking about killing him. (laughing) - Don't be a fool. You try anything right now you really are screwed. Besides, how am I gonna get my carton of smokes when you up in the chute? - You'll get them. And yeah though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death, I will fear no evil for thou art with me. They rod and thy staff ,they comfort me. And preparest the table before me in the presence of mine enemies. And anointeth my head with oil. My cup runneth over. Surely mercy and goodness shall follow me all the days of my life. - I knew I'd find you here. - You know this Beerman deposition's gonna be a nightmare. - Come on, Diana, I know you better than that. This can wait until tomorrow. Come on, let's get out of here. Come on. - I can't tell you how excited I was to see Alex. He seems really happy. He's got a good job. He's really matured. - Seems like it must have brought up some old feelings. - Yeah, well that's just it. I'm so torn. He's so wonderful and yet he just represents a part of my life that I'd just soon forget. - Diana, you can't blame yourself or Alex for what happened. You needed time to heal, honey. (laughing) I remember when I was first starting out. I was crazy about this guy Warren. You know, we were really good together but yeah, he wanted to start a family and I had other plans. But the point is, I had to make a choice. I still think about what my life would have been if I'd have made that choice. But those feelings are never gonna disappear. They are a part of you for better or for worse. You both deserve to be happy, you know. Just don't project feelings unto him that aren't his, huh? - You're right. You're right. - [Announcer] Following inmates have medication. Smith 209 up. Perry 126 lower. - Hi pop. - Hello, son. How are they treating you? - Ah, you know, same old same old. Numb the sleep with lousy food, you know the deal. - But, you look good. - Thanks. Well, looks can be deceiving. - How so? What's the matter? - You've always supported me, right pop? You've always stood behind me. - Of course. I always have and I always will. You know that. - He's in there. - Who? - The guy that raped Diana Scott. - Good god, how'd you know that? - 'Cause he's been talking, bragging about me doing his time. - Have you told anyone? - Pop, who am I gonna tell? Nobody's gonna listen to me. - [Pop] Maybe the warden, I mean you-- - Pop, I can't. Appeal to the warden? I'm your son, in your eyes, I'm innocent. In the eyes of the warden, I'm a convicted rapist. I might as well be invisible. - How can I help you? I mean how can I help you from out here? - Pop, there's nothing that you can do for me now. There's nothing that anybody can do for me now. Except maybe to pray. I am gonna try something known and I have to let you know. - [Pop] Dear lord, Malcolm, no. - Pop, I gotta do what I gotta do. - There has to be another way. - What other way, Pop? I've tried every other way I can think of. I've written so many damn letters I can't even move my fingers anymore. - You've got to have faith in God. You've got to have faith in the system. - I have faith in God. I've already made my peace with him. But faith in the system, no way. - There is one other letter you could write. (light blues music) - I heard you've been talking about me. - You're in my light, sunshine. - Like I said, I heard you've been talking about me. - Is that right? Well then tell me, what have you been hearing? What are you gonna do, boy? Go ahead, they'll put a bullet in your ass before you even squeeze a muscle. Go on, do it. You're even dumber than I thought. - Yeah, how so? - All they would have done is fire a warning shot. If it would have been me your eyes would be bulging from your dead skull. - Yeah, well like I said, I'm not you. - No you ain't. But you know what's funny? According to the Florida State Penal system you are. Cold blooded rapist. I do the crime and you do the time. Ain't the system pretty? - You two guys, back away from each other now! - I should have finished that girl off and your ass would be in here for murder. You think about that. - [Guard] Go get him, Tim. - [Tim] Come on. - I got your back, Tim. - I hope you like it in here, pal. 'Cause you're gonna be looking at these pussywillows a real long time. - Get my back, come on. Get on up there. Take him away. Come on, get over here. (knocking) - [Joanna] Got a minute? - Of course, come in. - We received a letter this morning and believe me I almost threw it away but, I thought you should know about it. - Who is it from? - Malcolm Humphries. - Would you please read it? - Diana, if you don't, - Just read it. - Dear Miss Scott. I hope this letter finds you well. You're in my prayers every night. I've asked my father to get this to you - [Malcolm] Since you won't let me have your address. I hope you get it. Because I've written to everyone else and I can't get anyone to listen. I know that you've been through some very hard times. And I also know that you must be very angry at the man who hurt you. - All I ask is that you consider what I have to say with an open mind. My father tells me you're a lawyer now so I figured you might help. There's another inmate here in prison that says he's the one that hurt you - [Malcolm] and he's got a scar similar to mine. Please, do a DNA test, just one. I realize the police had problems with that the last time and I know that you're convinced that I'm guilty but all I ask is one test - [Joanna] to set things right. I hope you can find it in your heart to give me this one chance. - [Malcolm] I'm sure the warden will let me give whatever samples you need. Please help me. God bless, Malcolm Humphries. - I want to take the case. - [Joanna] Diana, just take some time and think about it. - I need to know for sure. Look, if he's guilty, it still won't make any difference, right? - You don't owe this man a damn thing. - Yeah, but we're gonna find out, won't we? Look I'll pay for all the DNA test. - Don't be silly. The firm will cover all the expenses. If that's your decision, I'm gonna stand behind you 100%. You know that. - Thanks. (tense music) (computer beeping) (exhaling) - [Joanna] The results are negative. Malcolm's DNA doesn't match. - Hey detective, you know what my wife says they put in those things? - Oh Carl, any woman married to you is definitely no expert on wieners. I'll take my chances. (laughing) (radio chatter) (exhaling) Oh God. (inmates clapping) (ominous music) - Diana. - [Diana] Hi, Susan. - Hi, good to see you. Here. Tables to the left, chairs to the right. - Thanks. Well, you look good. You've been working out. - Yeah. - So things are going well at the firm? - Yeah. Where did I go wrong? - No, no, you can't blame yourself. - Of course I can blame myself. No one else identified him. No one else sat in a court of law and told the jury that that man raped me. No one else did that. No one else identified the wrong man. - Diana, DNA testing has gotten more precise. We can do things now that we could never have done before. Technology's improving itself every day. At the time, we did the best we could. - You wanna tell that to Malcolm Humphries? You wanna tell that to the man who had five years of his life stolen? - He doesn't blame you. - You've seen him? - Yeah. He told me he wants to talk to you to thank you. - In the letter he had mentioned another inmate. - Malcolm's given us a full report. We're getting a subpoena for his DNA of course to see if it matches your case. - Yeah but he said that he's only in there for five years. If he knows what I've done, - No, no, you have nothing to worry about. If what Malcolm says is right, he's gonna be in there a lot longer than that. - What do you know about him? - Arrested for assault and battery. This is his second conviction, a five year sentence. Now under the three strikes law, being convicted of your attack would put him away for life. Of course there would need to be a new trial. But with what we have and with your testimony, - What's his name? - [Joanna] Anthony Davis. - You better make sure them pussies were other clean, big guy. - Shut up. - Hehe yeah, that's what you should have done before. You shooting off about what you did to that girl, man. What, you think Malcolm ain't gonna tell nobody? (laughing) I think you screwed yourself heavy, partner. Heavy, heavy, heavy. - Back to work, poncho. - Poncho, my name ain't no damn Poncho, whitey. - You too, Davis, get raking. - Yeah boss. I'm working. - The hell? Ugh! - Davis! Give me the gun, Davis. - I don't think so, boss. I got something else planned today. (gun firing) - [Cop] What the hell? (gun firing) (clapping) (ominous music) (cracking) (sirens sounding) - [Diana] When did Malcolm and his dad move here? - [Susan] They're missionaries. They traveled in all different areas and helped start up new congregations. Nervous? - Yeah. - You tried calling them first? - I wanted to but I couldn't. - So you thought the good old fashioned surprise attack could be best? You're tougher than you look. - Can I ask you something? - Of course. - What happened to your rapist? - He was paroled three years ago. - You ever afraid he's gonna come back for you? - Yeah, at least once a night. Here, I see it. - [Diana] I hope this was the right thing to do. - [Susan] You'll be fine. Okay, come on. (church organ music) ♪ Amen, amen ♪ ♪ Amen ♪ - I see him, he's leading the choir. - May the grace of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ and the love of God and the fellowship of the holy spirit be with us all now and forevermore, amen. ♪ Amen ♪ - Thank you very much, thank you for coming. Have a wonderful Sunday, we'll see you next week. - Okay, here he comes. - Detective. - Malcolm, it's really good to see you. - Thank you. - I'll be outside, okay? - Miss Scott. - Oh God, I've been praying for the courage to face this moment. Face you. - I'm glad you did. Would you like to sit outside? It's always a little hot in here after the service. - Yeah, I'm feeling a little warm. - It's just in here. - Um, Oh God, I don't know what. Not sure where I'm gonna begin. I'm just gonna say it. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I can spend the rest of my life telling you that and it's still just isn't this. It just doesn't describe the feeling. Yeah. - It's all right. If it wasn't for you, I'd still be inside. Nobody wants to listen to a convict, you know? And I know. I know how hard it must have been on you. The whole time during the trial and even in prison all I prayed for was for justice for me and for you. - Wow. God bless you, Malcolm. God bless you. - God bless you too, Diana. (sobbing) Look I just, I'm just glad this nightmare's finally over. - Oh. Oh. Oh God. I'm so sorry. I was so sure that it was you. And I was wrong. - Well you know what, Diana, I put all my faith in the fact that being innocent will be enough to keep me free. Live and learn, that's what my pop always says. Live and learn. - Can you tell me about Anthony Davis? - Well, there's not much to tell. The man's barely human. No one can be who does what he does. - I can't imagine what it must have been like. For you to see him in there. - Well I'm not gonna lie to you. The first time I met him, I wanted to kill him. But I couldn't do it. God wouldn't let me. Anthony's got his punishment and it's gonna keep coming. There's no point in hurrying it along. - Well nobody knows better how you feel than I do. But you did the right thing. - I hope so. - You did. You did the right thing. - Hello, Reverend. Thank you for the lemonade. It was almost as sweet as your company. - Ooh, are all you detectives such smooth talkers? - Yes. - Well it was my pleasure, young lady. I want to thank you again for all you did to make things right. On behalf of my whole family we really appreciate it. - Oh please, no. - Come here, you. Be well. You and my son have suffered enough punishment. Be strong, keep your faith in God. And remember that you're always in our thoughts and our prayers. - Thank you. - I just wanted to say thank you for coming to see me. I mean to, - Yeah, I know what you mean. And I do see you. I see you as the angel that you are. - Goodbye, my friend. - Goodbye. (exhaling) - Malcolm, it was very nice to see you. - It was nice to see you. - All right. - Let's go back in. - [Man] Here you go, Miss. You need a hand down? - [Diana] No, I'm fine, thank you. - [Man] All right. Have a nice evening. (talking on the tv) - [Announcer] We interrupt this program for a late breaking bulletin. - Authorities are on the lookout tonight for an escaped convict. The fugitive Anthony Davis was serving a sentence for aggravated assault and had recently been implicated in a rape case from five years ago. He escaped from Central Florida Maximum Security Penitentiary while on work detail. Three guards and a fellow inmate were killed in the escape. (shattering) The County Police department has set up roadblocks at five mile radiuses and conducting house to house searches. If residents spot the fugitive, they are advised not to approach him as he is considered armed and extremely dangerous. - Susan, how's Diana? - She's doing better. I think her talk with Malcolm really helped her. - Well the next time you take off, don't forget your cellphone. - Who said I forgot it? - Listen, Anthony Davis escaped from prison. - What? - Yeah, he killed three guards and no one's seen him since. You think he'll go after her? - How would he know where she is? (phone ringing) - Hello, Alumni office. - Hi, this is Patrick Dolan from the Academy. We're having a 10 year reunion and I'm trying to locate one of our graduates, Diana Scott. - Oh, I can't do that. - Come on, you know what it's like trying to plan these reunion things. - Tell me about it. - [Anthony] Please, do me this favor. From one alumni office to another, I won't tell anyone you told me. - What was the name again? - Scott. Diana Scott. - Okay, you got a pen? - Thank you so much, Ma'am. You're a lifesaver. - [Diana] Thanks for coming. - [Alex] Of course, Diana. - Have you heard anything else on the news? - Uh you know, they're still looking for him. But they're gonna find him. You know, besides, what makes you think he's gonna come after you? And how would he ever find where you live? - You know what's funny? It's like these five years never happened. He's out there, you're here. - I was hoping that wasn't a bad thing. - It's not. - I wish I didn't have to leave. But I set up this meeting so I can't change it, I'm sorry. - Don't worry about me. I'm gonna be fine. - I'm gonna make it up to you. - [Diana] Mmm. - I would like to take you out for dinner. - You asking me out on a date? - I think we're a little past that, but yes I am. - Hmm, let me think about it. - I got you something. (light music) - It's beautiful. - I saw it in a shop window and it just made me think of you. All right. I'm gonna be back at around eight o'clock depending on traffic. - Don't be late. - If it's up to me, I won't. (light music) See you soon. (giggling) (alarm beeping) (ignition firing) (bashing) (grunting) (gates clanking) (tense music) - Hello? Hello? (lockers slamming) Who's out there? (typewriter clacking) - Good morning, Miss Scott. - Oh, hi Mona. - That's a lovely necklace. - Oh thanks. Alex gave it to me. So do I have any messages? - Um, can you join me for a minute in the office please? - Yeah. - That's okay, yeah. Listen, the detective called this morning and told me about Anthony Davis. Now I've called Chief Hutchinson and he's willing to send out a black and white. - Okay Joanna no, I can take care of myself. - [Joanna] This man could be dangerous if he thinks you're a threat. - But he doesn't know where I live. - And that is a chance you're willing to take? Listen, just at least stay with me, huh? - You know what, Alex is staying with me now. - Oh. - Yeah. He's on a business trip to Orlando for the afternoon but he's coming back tonight. Yeah, I'm gonna be fine. I'm gonna be fine. - I just, I just get so worried. - I know, I know. Don't worry. Don't worry, okay? (exhaling) - Carl, call Diana Scott's precinct and have him send a patrol car over to her house. - [Carl] What's up? - I just, I have a bad feeling. - Susan. - Just do it. - You got it. (tense music) - Mona? - [Mona] Yes, Miss Scott? - Can you come here for a second? Can you just look out the window, just tell me what you see? - A woman walking her dog. A couple crossing the street, why? - Nothing, thank you, Mona. - Is everything okay? - It's nothing, Mona. Thank you. Thanks. - All right. - [Machine] It's 7:04 p.m. (light music) (giggling) (thunder clapping) (ominous music) (shattering) (thunder rumbling) (gasping) - I borrowed some stuff. I hope you don't mind. Don't bother. I got those too. (Anthony groaning) (Anthony grunting and screaming) You hear me? You're dead! (phone dialing) - Please! (groaning) - When I get a hold of you, you're gonna wish I killed you the first time! - [Operator] I'm sorry, your call cannot be completed as dialed. (Anthony groaning) - I'm gonna kill you! You're gonna die. Oh, you're gonna die. I found you. - [Operator] 911. (bashing) (spray can hissing) (Anthony screaming) - [Anthony] No, ah! (bashing) (sirens sounding) - Shut up or I'll cut you. You know what, Anthony? You're not worth it. - Police, don't move! Miss, you all right? - I am now. (cuffs clicking) (Anthony groaning) - Who's that? - I'm a police officer, ma'am. - Hey I've got everything under control here if you wanna go inside and just sweep. You gonna be all right, miss? - Yes, what did you do with him? - He's in the car. He's under our control, you're safe. - Hey, there's a dead cop inside, it's Sullivan. - There's a dead cop in my house? - It's okay, it's okay. It's all right. - When did they send a cop out to my house? - Everything's gonna be okay. - Hey! Where's Diana? Has anyone seen Diana? - Alex? Alex! I'm over here, Alex! - Oh my God, are you okay? - Alex. - What happened? - He was in my house. - Anthony? - Yeah. - [Alex] Sorry. I'm so sorry. I love you. - I love you too. Oh my god. - [Alex] Come on, let me take you inside. Come on, let's go inside. - [Diana] Yeah, let's go inside. (door shutting) (somber music)
