In the late 19th century, a Jewish sports movement sprang up called the Maccabiah. It was often the only outlet for Jewish athletes who were excluded from their local national clubs. It's philosophy was to encourage Jews to become physically strong, to combat anti-Semitism and to imbue them with a national identity. In a series of bold and innovative PR exercises, groups of bikers set out for the British Mandate of Palestine to find athletes to take part in the first Maccabiah games in Tel Aviv in 1932. The games would offer the athletes and their families a safe haven for the increasing persecution in Europe. Now 80 years later, for the first time ever, the games will be held in Berlin, the crucible of Hitler's final solution. 11 bikers embark on a unique journey setting off from Israel, they carry the Maccabiah torch to Berlin. For some, it's a chance to learn about the past, for others it's a chance to reveal it. This is a story of survival, redemption and discovery, a journey that will take them "Back to Berlin." Among them is Gal Marom who's grandfather, Solomon was one of the original riders. I live in , I'm an architect. In the 1930's there were three group of bikers that went out from Palestine through the world and through Europe, especially. This is a picture that took place, I think, in Montreal. This is the biker, this is all the guys from the Jewish community. And basically what's weird in this photo that this is my grandfather and someone or maybe he wrote his name, Solomon here under his image. There were 11 bikes and I think the number 11 was like the 11 tribes that went to bring the lost tribe from around the world. My grandfather was actually my father and he raised me as a son. He was a boxer and a boxing referee. He was a role model for me. And of course he raise me on his stories about his childhood. And of course, one of the big stories that is with me until today is about this journey around the world to spread the rumor about the Maccabiah. When Maccabiah organized their own games in Berlin, Gal had the opportunity to retrace his grandfather's journey. He joined 10 other male and female bikers, some of them relatives of Holocaust survivors. Among them, Danny and his 78-year-old father, Yoram. - I'm Danny Maron, son of Yoram and I'm a press photographer here in Israel for the last 25 years and I'd like to try the journey with my father. For me it was a huge opportunity to understand and to know something about my father and my family history. - There were two reasons why I decided to go. One, physically, to prove to myself that I still can ride more than 400 kilometers a day and the second one was a ride to my past. It was something that I could only dream to arrive at the Olympics Stadium in Berlin with my son. In 1936, the Olympic games were hosted by Germany. In direct contrast to Olympic ideals, the Nazi party used the games to spread it's propaganda of Aryan supremacy. The world outside Germany claimed to know little about Hitler's anti-Semitic agenda until he issued a ban on German-Jewish athletes participating in the 1936 games. There was an international outcry followed by threats of boycott. Hitler relented and reluctantly allowed only one German Jew to compete. As the American delegation set sail from New York, on board were Marty Glickman and Sam Stoller, the only two Jews on the American track and field team. - As an athlete this was a goal for any track and field performer to make the Olympic team and to participate in the Olympic games and perhaps even to win a medal, perhaps even a gold medal. I can show the rest of the world that a Jew could be just as good as anyone else. The two Jewish athletes were preparing for the men's four by 100 meter relay race when there was a shock announcement. - Well the morning of the day we're supposed to run the relay, all the sprinters were called into a meeting and Robinson said, "Marty and Sam are gonna be replaced by Jesse Owens and Ralph Metcalf." That was a complete shock to all of us. The ritual of carrying the Olympic torch from Greece to the host city was resurrected in Germany in 1936 to mark the transfer of power from Olympia to Berlin. For today's riders, the passing of the torch will carry a greater significance. - Like the Germans in 1936 Olympic games, we are carrying the torch from Athens to Berlin but we do a small detour. Carrying the torch back to Berlin will cover nearly 3,000 miles of roads across southern and central Europe. The journey will be challenging in ways that none of them could have expected. The bikes leave the Port of Haifa on the coast of Israel and travel to Athens in Greece where the riders discover that flying the Israeli flag may prove problematic. - I don't think it's a good idea. I'm really sorry to say this. - That's really shocking I must say. - Yes and it's probably the only flag in the world that you cannot raise in Greece so easy. The bikers travel north from Athens to Greece's second largest city Thessaloniki, the home of Kobi's grandparents before the war. - It was too hot, I couldn't stay inside in there. I joined this journey two months pregnant and I'm trying to imagine people, women inside, maybe pregnant, little children, 10 days on the train going nowhere, they don't know where they're going without food, without water. We are always hearing about Holocaust but to feel the train, to feel the heat, to hear the story, I don't know, I can't even explain what I'm feeling, it's too much, it's too much. In Cyprus, the camps are bitter reminders of the recent past. Here 60,000 illegals are forced to stay. In rebellion, newcomers shout of Dachau, Birkenau, Auschwitz but it's to no avail. Under a quota, only 750 people a month will be allowed into Palestine. And under armed guard they wait, neither starved nor beaten, nor tortured, but prisoners without identity, behind barbed wire again. From Cyprus, it's but a night's journey to Palestine. From Greece, the bikers travel on from Bulgaria which holds a personal significance for Gilly Shem Tov. - I am very nervous and I'm very excited to be here because I've never been to Bulgaria and I never learned my family past in Bulgaria, only since they came to Israel, I know some details but not from Bulgaria. My grandfather was born here in Samokov. He always talked about Samokov and as his place of birth, Samokov was in his heart. And he was very special for me. All his life he stood up for the working people, fighting for social injustice. I think a lot of thing he got from here from Bulgaria, by being involved in the community, the Bulgarian community, not only the Jewish community. He joined Maccabiah here in Bulgaria when he was young, learned Hebrew, learned how to work farms and he taught me that everyone are equal. Not all of the atrocities of the Holocaust were perpetrated by the Nazis themselves. As the bikers cross the border into Romania, they're met by another rider who would join them on the next leg of their journey to Berlin. - I am Maxmillia Marco Katz. I am an business manager and administrator. I am from Romania. What happened in this synagogue in January 1941, it was that my grandfather, Marco Katz, the one that I'm named after, he was here praying together with other Jews from Bucharest. The Legionnaires pulled all the Jews out of the synagogue, among them my grandfather and they started to torture him. My uncle, Isador Katz begged them to release his father and to take him in his place. They did not release the old man but they kept the son. In the front of the old man, they started to torture the son. The Romanian fascists took Marco's uncle, together with 155 other Jews to one of their centers for torture, Jilava Fort number 13. - So my uncle was brought here. He was brought here when he had already, one of the shoulder pulled out. I don't know how I feel, I'm just trying to figure out how my uncle felt when he was brought here. They were brought from the fort here, stripped naked beaten up and then shot in their heads. So this is the way Isador Katz, my uncle died. Other Jews they were taken in the center of Bucharest to a slaughter house and 15 of them, they were killed there in the same manner, they were shot and then they were hanged. They were hooked up and on their naked bodies there was written kosher meat. - So my name is Yaron Munz, I'm a surgeon. When I knew about this project, for me, it was the Romanian Holocaust because nobody would even know that there were Holocaust in Romania, actually they didn't know. And my parents are survivors, so I felt the Holocaust when I was brought up. And for me I actually thought that well I can't understand how so many people could have gone and perish without any resistance, so I sometimes used to talk about them on that issue and I never got any cooperation from mother, neither from my father they said, "Okay it wasn't like that, but we don't wanna talk about it." The Romanian Army came into the village. They had a loud speaker and they said by tomorrow morning everybody has to come with one suitcase and leave all of your belongings back, take only what necessary and all the families and come to the train station. This is how it started. And my mother remembers her mother, holding her up to have some air because they were stuffed. - When was that? - 41 June yeah. My grandfather at the time was caught by the Legionnaires it was about mid-1940. And he was jailed, tortured, beaten and the only thing that saved him was the earthquake that was in Romania of 1940. Everything collapsed in that building where the Legionnaires office was. He was hanged upside down, totally beaten, bruised and so on but he fell down, he could open the bondings and so on and he escaped and it took him a few months to get back because of his situation. - In order to feel what they you need to be in that location at that time in that condition. - But this is the thing, Marco, I don't wanna feel what they feel, I already understand what they feel, I understand, I understand. My dad is not talking at all, I can't, whenever I talk to him and he's totally clear in his mind, he doesn't talk. - He refuses. - Yeah, he kinda refused to talk about it. It's a black hole. When we arrived the bikes in Romania, we loved the biking there. Went through the lovely mountains and it was amazing. The biking part of this story is kinda, it's not just to bring us from A to B with the bike, it's a very important part of the whole thing, it's a tour, we're doing a tour, like half of Europe or something like that. I don't pretend to make my story bigger than any story, I think all the stories in this tour are small stories that are part of the bigger picture. All the stories were horrific in the same, it's like the same, it's just different people, more people died in one place than the other, but still it was the same Holocaust. When the 1936 Olympics ended, Hitler ramped up his campaign against the Jews. The Jews of London are marching today to denounce Adolf Hitler's anti-Semitic policy. It became increasingly difficult for the world to ignore. Of German-made goods. As the team travels along the border between Hungary and Serbia, they're met by thousands of refugees and hundreds of border police, armed guards and troops. - Unbelief, we go into a country, a border like this. It's sad to see. - We are from Israel. - In my school, they say Israel is my enemy you have to fight Israel and you have to destroy Israel. - No, it's closed okay. - Near Rozke. - Yeah, near Rozke. - Is it open, the border? - The small one is open, the big one is closed. - Oh okay. - It's not a biking trip, it was really a journey for everyone of us. All the time I heard my grandfather in my head and tried to connect to his experience along the way. But the difference between them and today is that those days they could go up on their bikes and just drive around the world without any customs, without any borders. They went to Alexandria, they went to Libya, to Lebanon. Even one expedition I heard that went through Syria. The 1935 bikers, set off amidst a backdrop of growing anti-Semitism. In September of the same year, Nazi Germany had created it's Nuremberg laws which had a crippling economic and social impact on the Jewish community. They were subsequently expanded to include homosexuals all roamly people, Afro-Germans and the disabled. These people became what Germany called, enemies of a race-based state. Despite this threat to their safety, the 1935 bikers continued their epic mission, visiting Jewish communities to spread their message. And today's riders are doing the same. - My mother will never speak about the Holocaust, never because she don't want I am a void emotion about that. After all I am starting to ask the questions about the Holocaust, it's coming for me. This is I think, it's better. Whoa, it's alive. - We ride with the Israeli flags on, what do you think the response we're going to get? - Some people might not be happy and some people might just okay Israelis. - I'm a mother of two children, boy and girl, Jade and James, I'm a farmer. I have a personal connection to everything that happened with the Maccabiah games. My grandmother was photographed with those bikers that came to Lithuania to tell about the Maccabiah games. To think that after I got involved with all this journey, to think that my grandmother actually met those bikers for me was a huge, huge excitement. My grandparents left Europe from Lithuania just before the Holocaust and they left when they realized that life in Europe became too dangerous and too difficult for Jews, they made a choice and the choice was to look at what happened and move on and find a new place for them to live in. And their decision saved their life. Their entire family was destroyed in the Holocaust. As the bikers travel further into Hungary, they reach the banks of the River Danube, a sight of an atrocity at the hands of the Hungarian fascists, the Arrow Cross. They meet Alex Rosencrass who's mother survived the offense of the Danube in 1944. Alex has traveled from Berlin to meet the bikers with his daughter, Talia and to share his mother's story with them for the first time. They've come to memorial site for those who were brought here as part of Hungary's final solution offering to Hitler. They were rounded up in the thousands, their shoes removed for monetary value. And their laces used to bind their hands. - My mother's family who lived here before the war, very family in positions and in the 1944 the Jews were killed here at the Danube. And what happened is that the Hungarian Nazis, they're called Arrow Cross, they came to these houses with trucks and they brought them here to the Danube and they killed them here, they shot them here and threw them into the water. And the whole Danube was red for days and days it was a red river cause all the thousands of dead Jews. My mother was sitting on one of the trucks and what happened is that German Nazi officer came by, saw my mother who was so beautiful and he forced her down from this truck and sent her back to the house and so she survived. And all the others on the truck were killed here at the Danube, nobody came back. That's the story of my mother, how she survived. She came after that into a labor camp where she escaped from that and that's what I know. Not too many of her family survived. - I was shocked I didn't know what happened here. I've never heard the story. I didn't know how his mother was saved. It's a beautiful story in some way and a terrible one too of course. As the bikers travel in convoy through Budapest their presence causes concern for the authorities. An a police escort is provided. - I wasn't happy with the police escort. They come with us in Greece or in Poland or in Hungary because I want to know what will happen if we drive with our flag, with the Israeli by ourself all over Europe. And I was curious to see if something happened. The Jews that we met in Europe during our journey, they have a conflict, a big conflict, maybe not to show to everybody they are still a Jew. It doesn't matter what country you are. If it's in Germany or Greece or Poland, the Jews prefer to hide their identity even now. - Ladies and gentlemen our dear friends a warm welcome to the motorcyclists from Israel. It's a great honor and pleasure to welcome you here on your way to Berlin. You riding in Hungary with the Israeli flag, it's something else, it shows that in spite of everything, we are here, welcome. - Everybody would like to drink something, so we would like to offer you Hungarian beer zero alcohol, zero alcohol. That's not a beer. It's in Poland that the team makes it's planned detour for the route taken by the original bikers to visit a place that predecessors could scarcely have imagined. - That's Krakow we're gonna go west to Krakow. We're gonna go through three countries today. We're gonna leave Hungary and then we're going through Slovakia, beautiful road and then we're going to go to Poland. We can reach in one day. - Lots of family there. - Yeah. - You don't come in from Canada on a motorcycle. - I tried, I tried. I'm from Toronto, Canada. My family originated from Poland. I was born in Sandomiez which is east of Krakow. My family both sides were very dramatically affected by the war and the Holocaust. - Is it your first time here? - No, no I was born here. - And I'm not unique. Those that are predominately children of survivors, they have the same issues that I had. They call their parents damaged goods. - I mean, this is a guy who has been there, for me it was shocking. I all of a sudden realize we have with us somebody that experienced this thing that when you look at it, it looks so far away but there we was and I was so attached to hear him. When you hear one person's story it tells you the story of everyone else that can't tell their story. - I think I was born July 13th, 1942. And my mother at that time knowing what was coming down the pipe made arrangements which she had blue eyes, blonde hair made arrangements for a phony I.D. to give birth at the Convent Hospital in Sandomeiz. So these people took us in and then my mother left and they raised me as one of their own. Have you been with the family? - About three and a half years. - And you thought they were your parents or you knew? - No, no. - And your mother came or she didn't see-- - My mother came afterwards. - After three and a half years. - After three and a half years. - Where had she been all this time? - With the Polish underground. - Oh really? - Yeah. - And she was nervous, she came there originally with me and then she was nervous that she would be found out so she left. - And how did you react when you realized, I know you were only three and a half but. - When I was born I didn't react. - You hardly have memories. - But my psychiatrist tells me that I still remember okay but she came to pick me up when I was three and a half she took me away from my mother. And we asked the nephew of the people that saved me what made them do it and why didn't other people have the chance to do it? And the answer's always the same they were that kind of people. They did it because they felt they needed to, they had to, so. - When you always think about the people who helped, you wonder how you do. - How you would do it, if you were in the same position. - If you were on the other side would you keep quiet. - Where's the plaque. Oh is this it? Yeah, you see. - That's the synagogue. - Yeah. It's a former synagogue till the end of 17th, the present house city archives. The riders push on to Warsaw. In 1939, there were more than 350,000 Jews living in the Polish capital. In the autumn of 1940, the Nazis sealed the entire Jewish population into the ghetto. - How they went like cattle to the slaughter house. We cannot now judge them and we cannot put ourself in their position in those days because I'm not sure if I were in this era how I'm supposed to react and cope with it. The remaining prisoners of the Warsaw ghetto realized that the deportations were sending people to their deaths. In January 1943, after smuggling in handguns and small explosives, a tiny resistance group fought back seizing control of the ghetto from the Nazis. Three months later on the eve of Passover, the Nazis mounted a massive counter attack. They bombarded the ghetto and raised it to the ground, murdering anyone they could find. Meanwhile delegates from Britain and America met for 10 days in Bermuda to discuss Hitler's plans for the Jewish people. Despite the horrors unfolding in Europe, no agreement was reached and no action was taken. The prisoners at Lodz Ghetto were forced to manufacture goods and weapons for the Nazi war machine. Survival was based on ability to work. Lodz was one of the last of the Jewish ghettos to be liquidated. That moment I had seen the and immediate I had seen my cell with my mother and the train station with the same transport and we have seen and I was ashamed. I wanted to escape from there. I felt very angry seeing all the names, like you wanna help them and say stop it. People that were sent to death only because they were Jews. I was looking for my friend's family's name but too many names there to try to find it. It's just unbelievable. - Two things get me here one is my mother was hiding in the forest with the partisans for almost four years. It could have been here, who knows and then maybe a spot over there, Germans brought a thousand Jews and shot them. When I see these guys here these 45 all going on 50 young Israelis, that's one of the reasons that it's not gonna happen again. They won't let it happen again. It's interesting to experience this on a motorcycle. I've experienced it a lot of different ways, never like this so. The most important thing for me is to really to feel free, driving a bike you really ascribe from all troubles you may have. By late 1944, the allies were beginning to uncover some of the atrocities that had befallen Europe's Jews and other ethnic minorities. However, the German propaganda machine was still determined to sell a different story. Denmark had requested that the Red Cross inspect the conditions of the almost 500 Danish Jews held in the ghetto at Theresienstadt. The Germans gathered their healthy Jews together dressed them in respectable clothing, beautified the camp and readied it for inspection. A propaganda film was made at the same time. - This was the Nazi propaganda film to show the world how well the Jews were treated. Two Jewish teams had to play each other and four of them was the Maccabiah players and it was in 1944. Three weeks later after this football match, they and the audience 47,000 people were sent to the death camps. Pause awhile as you pass by. Close your eyes and remember, remember the time when here or near here men, women and children, our own fellow creatures congregated in peace and trust only to be arrested, humiliated, deported and murdered in the camps that shall forever shame our civilization. Remember them their anguish and their death. Do not recoil in such horror, do not descend into despair at man's inhumanity to men, just remember for remembering we honor the dead and we save them from dying again in oblivion. After 24 days, traveling through eight European countries, the riders are on the final leg of their journey. As I understood you had a very comfortable ride. Yeah, but now after a little delay of-- - Just two hours delay. - We met here so, straight to Berlin. We have a very nice road, which we came here but now we will go on the highway, yeah. Great. - When the highway ends we turn to the right, right and then left. Okay, no worries. And then we will come to the Brown Brigade and this is the road where the Nazis loved to march. - You know in the particular moment when we saw Brown Brigade everything exploded. It was exciting, it was like a victory parade. For me wasn't the torch itself. The focus was the people. A lot of things to pass along the way to be in Auschwitz, in Lutz, in Warsaw. And of course, in and Berlin, Bulgaria, and that everyone told his story or his family's story. - I'm very happy and I hope that this is a sign that never again, Holocaust. - Of course I admire my father more, much more when I know the history. I can say that for my mind, he's a hero. Arriving at Olympiastadion, the riders have finally completed the nearly 3,000 mile journey back to the site of the infamous 1936 Olympics. - Yeah, the president of Germany is gonna be here and we're gonna close all this VIP block and then we're gonna park in two lines okay. - My cousin was supposed to run here in the '36 Olympics and they wouldn't let him run. Relatives of the two Jewish-American athletes who were dropped on the morning of the 1936 relay race are here to take the torch from the bikers to signal the beginning of the European Maccabiah games. As the bikers enter the stadium, Sam Stoller's cousin passes to the torch to Marty Glickman's daughter who is proudly wearing her father's originally 1936 uniform. Nancy Glickman please light the torch. - About three years ago I find out about all these biker stories and I thought that as is the first time they're going to have the games in Germany it was going to be a historic moment in time to come back here and to light the torch.
