[ Ukulele playing ] [ Tempo increases ] JAKE: This is my second show for this West Coast tour. We have a show pretty much every day. We're just kind of working our way up the coast. All of this is pretty new to me, so, it's, um... Sometimes I see, like, my name on a billboard or something. You know, it just kind of trips me out. It's really incredible, if you think about it -- I mean, especially for a solo ukulele player from Hawaii. Never in my wildest dreams did I ever think that I'd be here. [ Cheers and applause ] [ Ukulele playing ] [ Pitch rising ] [ Cheers and applause ] [ Mid-tempo ukulele music plays ] I remember when I was in elementary school, I used to think, "Oh, man, my last name's so long. "No one's gonna ever remember my last name or know how to spell it." Shima... buka -- bukuro. Jake "Shimabuko." That's close. So, this is Madeira High School? No! No! No! No! Traditionally, the ukulele has been known to -- You know, you play Hawaiian music with it, which sounds kind of like this. [ Mid-tempo ukulele music plays ] But you can play more than just Hawaiian music with the ukulele. You can play blues. [ Blues music plays ] You can play rock 'n' roll. [ Rock music plays ] You can play classical music. [ Beethoven's "Fur Elise" plays ] And, you know, now, because I play the ukulele, I get to travel all around the world. I've been to places like Japan, Australia, Canada... San Diego? Yes, I've even been to San Diego. [ Laughter ] I've been playing the ukulele since I was 4 years old. 4 years old. That's right. That's 10 years ago. Both my parents love music. My mom -- not only was she my first ukulele teacher, but my mom is an excellent singer. We call her the karaoke queen. When I used to play the ukulele, Jake always wanted to play the ukulele. He wanted to always think it was a toy. But I didn't let him play it till 4 years old, until his fingers could reach the chord. So that's when we started having our lessons. [ Soft ukulele music plays ] JAKE: I remember the first time she put it in my hands, I was just mesmerized by the sound of the instrument. Every time I played the ukulele or I heard it, I just felt so at peace. It just brought me home. [ Ukulele music continues ] The divorce of my parents was -- was quite difficult, you know, for -- for me. I mean, I think I was very confused. I was in the 6th grade, and my brother was in the 1st grade. When my mom told me that they were getting divorced, I didn't know what that meant. I think Jake took it a little harder than I did. CAROL: Jake was really quiet. You know, he didn't say much. When he stressed at school, when he's going through depression, the ukulele was his release. That's why he would lock himself in the room, and he would just play. [ Ukulele music continues ] I just played. It wasn't practice. I just played. After my parents got divorced, my mom, she was working all the time, and she worked in the bars to support me and my younger brother, and I was always kind of taking care of him, making sure he did his homework and would eat dinner and go to bed on time. Almost felt like he was almost like my son. I mean, my mom will always tell me today, "Sorry you didn't have a childhood growing up," you know. But I don't feel like I missed out on anything, you know? I haven't been here in -- So, you were raised here? Yeah. In fact, we used to live in one of the apartments up there. I mean, it looks so different. They redid all the -- all the houses. So, what you doing over here? I thought you lived mainland. No, no, I still live in Hawaii. But I'm gone 9 or 10 months out of the year. Nice to meet you. What's up, man? You guys like ukulele? Yeah? Oh, is it okay if I play a song for you guys? All right, all right, here we go. You want me to go as fast as I can go? Yeah. Okay. This much. That much? Okay. You ready? You ready? [ Up-tempo ukulele music plays ] Oh, yeah! Faster. Faster! Oh! When I was your age, I used to run around over here all the time and play my ukulele. Yeah. Over here? Mm-hmm. Who wants to play my ukulele? Me. No! Yeah? You want to play it? He's too young. How old are you? 4. I was 4 years old when I started playing the ukulele. Really? Yeah, I was your age. Uh-huh. JAKE: This is like 30 years later. It's almost like reconnecting with myself again when I was their age. When my mom was working, I would always be playing the ukulele 'cause it would remind me of her. Whenever I played the ukulele, it was like she was home with us, and I think, as I got older, putting more time and energy into playing the ukulele helped to make up for some of that time that I didn't get to spend with my mom when I was a kid. I remember coming home from the bar like 2:00, 2:30 in the morning. And, you know, I would just throw my tips in my purse and then... I can't remember if Jake was 13, 14. Maybe 13. But I would come home, and he would be waiting up for me. The brother would be sleeping. And I would turn over my purse. I'd go, "Oh, this is how much I made tonight." And he would know what I have to pay, and we'd count the money. I remember, one night, he said, "Oh, Mom, you got $50 extra. What you gonna do with that?" I said, "What you want to do?" I remember he said to me, he said, "Mom, one day, I'm going to do so good, you won't need to work anymore." Being a mother, you say, "Oh, that's cute. Oh, so touching," but you would never think it would come true. [ "Bohemian Rhapsody" plays ] MAN: Welcome to another amazing day at Google, and today is particularly amazing since we have Jake here for a Musicians@Google performance. The way that I see the ukulele is because it has such a small range and it's only four strings, I find a lot of power in that because then it challenges me to really expand on the other aspects of music. I never saw the limitations as something that would hold me back. [ Camera shutter clicks ] Thanks a lot. My whole life, I always wanted a Kamaka four-string tenor. That was, like, the Excalibur of ukuleles. But they were the most expensive. [ Tapping ] This kid, it was his in high school. You know, so he's maybe 15 or 16 years old. Keeps calling in, wants this uke made for him. He wanted something fancy. And I'm like, "Really? Who is this kid?" I'd say, "Who is he?" You know, he had glasses. He wasn't as in shape as he is now, you know? [ Laughing ] So he just kind of looked like the kid down the street. Then I heard him play, and I was just like... [ Laughs ] "This is Jake?" I said, "Wow." I was amazed. [ Mid-tempo ukulele music plays ] At that point, I just told him, I said, "I'll make whatever ukes you want me to make for you," after that. JAKE: So, right when I graduated high school, I started working at this music store, and it was called House of Music. While I was working at the House of Music, I met Jon. He had a really unique singing voice. And then I met Lopaka, who worked at House of Music with me, and he was a brilliant percussionist. We actually started playing together, I think, in '94, and we formed a band called Pure Heart. * Did I ever say * How I feel about you? * And did I never find... JAKE: We'd go to these different places, and we'd say, "Hey, can we play in your restaurant?" And they'd be like, "Oh, you have to bring a demo tape," and at the time, my former ukulele teacher started up a record label. I wanted to record an album of all of my students. I asked Jake, "You want to be a part of this thing?" He said, "Yeah, but can I bring my band?" JAKE: We kept thinking, "Oh, this is great, "because now we'll have a high-quality demo tape that we can present to all these restaurants and clubs that we wanted to play at." MAN: Ladies and gentlemen, in studio with me right now the brothers of Pure Heart! JAKE: I remember the day that the album was released, a lot of the local radio stations kind of supported the album, and they played the entire record on the radio. * I just saw you there * And with just one stare * You broke my heart in two * Now I'm not the same * I'm a bit insane * All in love for you CAROL: When that CD came out, I'd run out to Tower Records. I would buy five, whatever I could afford, and I would give it out free to everybody. JAKE: We started doing our own concerts and doing these bigger venues, and I think that's when it all kind of started. I thought, "Wow." You know... "I really want to do music." [ Ukulele solo ] I looked at almost as like it was a sport. When I would get up on stage to play, it was like game time. [ Up-tempo ukulele playing ] [ Cheering ] In that single moment, you just feel so connected with everything around you, physically, mentally, spiritually. You feel like you're doing the one thing that you're supposed to be doing at that moment. It was almost impossible to sit in the audience and not be drawn to this -- I mean, this phenom of a ukulele player. His destiny was, at that point, starting to become apparent. I could finally start to see where his vision was. This guy actually believes, somehow, in his head, that this ukulele is something that could take him worldwide. [ "Crazy Words, Crazy Tunes" plays ] * There's a guy I'd like to kill * * And if he doesn't stop, I will * * Got a ukulele and a voice that's loud and shrill * JAKE: Outside of Hawaii, people didn't take the instrument seriously. You had guys like Tiny Tim playing "Tiptoe Through the Tulips." It locked people into this certain image of the kind of music that it could produce. [ "Tiptoe Through the Tulips" plays ] * Oh, tiptoe through the window * * By the window, that is where I'll be * * Come tiptoe through the tulips with me * KAMAKA: It's more like a gimmick -- a gimmick instrument. We never played it like that in Hawaii. We've never heard it played like that. So it kind of hit me inside because we don't make gimmick instruments. In my mind, we make musical instruments. MAN: Jake Shimabukuro! JAKE: In Hawaii, we've always respected the instrument. You know, it was a big part of our culture and still is. I have to be truthful. One of the best is my husband, Israel Kamakawiwo'ole. Moon Kauakahi. We have Jake Shimabukuro. For my grandchildren, they like the contemporary music, but for me, it's also very important that they learn the traditional, to know your roots, know where you come from. [ Singing in Hawaiian ] JAKE: I started out playing a lot of traditional Hawaiian music. That's my foundation. But as far as ukulele players go, Eddie Kamae was the best. He was the first ukulele virtuoso. He was the one who made it all possible. [ Singing in Hawaiian ] Back then, he was playing, like, jazz standards and Spanish guitar pieces but on ukulele. That's when I think that little light bulb went off in my head, and I realized that, "Wow. "I didn't just have to listen to ukulele music. I could play a jazz standard or a pop song." [ Mid-tempo music plays ] [ Tempo increases ] [ Finale plays ] MAN: You just finished your Japan tour. How was it this time? I wanted to really convey my appreciation to the Japanese audience here. I've been touring here for nine years. I just appreciate them accepting me. So, this verse over here is actually this verse up here, and this second verse is the one on -- Okay. I see. [ Ukulele playing ] [ Kaz humming ] Yeah. Right? I don't know. I'm just following you. Kaz and I have been working together for about 12 years. KAZ: I'm originally from Japan, a city called Sendai. And I moved to Hawaii in 1992. JAKE: When I met Kaz, she really believed in what I was doing, and she said she wants to help me. Back then, there was no such thing as a touring solo ukulele player who doesn't sing. Because of her confidence in me, it gave me the courage to make a solo career. I had no idea where this was gonna go. All I knew was that I needed someone that I could trust and worked very, very hard. KAZ: Coming from a totally different background, different culture, I guess Jake and I clicked. JAKE: She basically did everything for me -- answering all the e-mails and making all the phone calls. You know, even doing my laundry and ironing my clothes sometimes. One of the first times I went to Japan with Kaz, we went to her hometown, and she showed me around, took me to a lot of places from when she was a kid, some of her favorite restaurants. It's a special -- We're having a special night for Kazusa 'cause it's her birthday. [ Cheers and applause ] TERADA: Kaz had set up a showcase in Japan. She had called all these major record labels, which is unheard of. You don't just say, "Hey, can you guys come down and watch this guy play?" JAKE: They never signed a ukulele player before. I remember just feeling the pressures of trying to write some original songs. So I went out and I bought an electric guitar, and all I did was sit with that electric guitar and I just strummed chords. I started hearing different things, a different kind of melody. And then I remember picking up my ukulele and then trying to find that melody on the ukulele and figuring out how to play it. I wanted to take a lick like... [ Ukulele strumming ] ...you know, and really make it sing. [ Electric ukulele strumming ] So, the first two songs that I wrote for my very first solo CD was written on an electric guitar. [ Up-tempo ukulele playing ] Back then, all I wanted to do was play everything as fast as I could. [ Tempo increases ] I started looking into distortion pedals and different amplifiers -- you know, all of these different things to kind of change the sound of the instrument. [ Ukulele playing continues ] Now that I look back, I realize that I was walking a very fine line between being a little disrespectful to the instrument. I was trying to make the ukulele something else. And I remember being very insecure without having all my effects with me. I was like, "Well, hey, "if I want to manipulate the sound of my instrument, "I'm gonna do it with my hands. I'm not gonna do it electronically." [ High-pitched ukulele strumming ] And once I committed to that path, the way that I approached music changed. It wasn't just about trying to play as fast as I could anymore, but it was about letting the instrument breathe. That was when I really started to learn how to utilize space in my music. [ Ukulele playing continues ] I always felt that my music career and my personal life were kind of the same. Everything was always about the music. But now I have this amazing person in my life. [ Guitar strumming ] KELLY: One of my friends wanted to set Jake and I up, so we had actually kind of set a date. And he did call me later on, and he sounded kind of terrible, actually, and he said he was really sick, and so if we could reschedule, and I told him that was fine. It was around that time that I got superbusy traveling, as well, so, um... to make a long story short, it was about three years later that I called her back to reschedule that date. And, basically, it was Jake on the phone just saying hi, you know, "How are you? Just going through the contacts on my phone." [ Laughing ] Well, we -- No, no. I mean, it was -- No, that's what you said. [ Both laugh ] KELLY: In that first year when we were dating, he must have been gone a good eight, nine months out of that year, which was a normal touring schedule for him. Having only met a person a few times and having them leave, it was a lot harder than I had imagined. JAKE: We would have this long-distance relationship. We took the time to communicate, to write to each other. Like, I remember, after a show, I couldn't wait to see if she responded to an e-mail or something, you know? Be counting down the days until I could see her again. We talked on the phone frequently, and that's when I think I really, honestly, started to, I think, fall in love with him. It really made us appreciate the time that we did have together. One thing about a relationship is we really do both understand the devotion that we both have to our careers, even though they're very different. Hawaii has always been the only true home to me, and I've always wanted to practice medicine here. JAKE: She worked her whole life to be a doctor. I see how she's just so driven and how she's so committed to her patients and, you know, her art. That's her art form. I think that's really what connects us. I don't think I could be with anybody who didn't always strive to be -- to be their best. Some of that stubbornness and drive in our careers, we apply that to making it work out, even if it's not necessarily the easiest path. [ Soft ukulele music plays ] JAKE: Every time I go on another tour, that's time that I'm taking away from our relationship. And still I continue to -- to leave, you know? It's gonna be tough to find, man, especially with all this snow. Yeah, six or seven years ago, we were here, and I was shooting a -- We were filming this local TV show called "Ukulele Disco." It was a lot warmer. [ Laughs ] And, uh -- Yeah, and I played an arrangement of "While My Guitar Gently Weeps" here, and -- I mean, I had no idea, you know, that -- I mean, at the time, I didn't even know what YouTube was. YouTube had just started out, so it was -- it was just one of those things, you know? You know, I just got lucky. This is a song that was composed by one of my favorite songwriters, Sir George Harrison. So, uh... Well, since we're in Central Park near the Strawberry Fields, I thought this would be kind of cool. Song entitled "While My Guitar Gently Weeps." Something like this. The video of Jake's on YouTube was uploaded about five years ago, which is right around the time that YouTube started. It was uploaded unbeknownst to Jake. This video soon became in the millions of video views. It was one of the first viral videos on YouTube. JAKE: I was performing in Japan, and I was doing a few things on the mainland, but it really wasn't until YouTube... I mean, things just kind of exploded. KAZ: I started receiving e-mails from literally people from all over the world. JAKE: I mean, through that video, I got to perform and record with people like Jimmy Buffet and the Coral Reefers, Yo-Yo Ma, Bette Midler. It's amazing what one little video clip can do. [ Ukulele playing continues ] [ Cheers and applause ] Wow! Man! Thank you so much. That was unbelievable! Unbelievable! Thank you very much. We've been doing this show a long time, ladies and gentlemen. That's one of my favorite things I've ever seen over here -- Jake Shimabukuro. We'll take a break. We'll be right back. [ Cheers and applause ] [ Piano playing ] KAZ: He's known as an innovative ukulele player, so I'm sure he has a lot of, you know, pressure and stress to following up his own success. Okay, I think I got it. There are times when I'm by myself and I just feel like, "I don't know if I can do this." Sometimes I feel like, "Man, I just -- I've just been getting lucky, you know, the last few years." But I feel like one of these days that that luck's gonna run out. Basically, this is the range of the ukulele -- middle C, then you have a C above that, and then one C above that. So that's about it. And I just came up with this little chord progression. [ Soft piano music plays ] I sat there with my uke, and then I started playing this piece. [ Ukulele music plays ] I don't know. Maybe it's the Japanese in me because, culturally, you don't know how to deal with praise or compliments. It makes you uncomfortable. Maybe it's because you don't feel like you deserve it and that's why you work extra hard -- because you feel this tremendous responsibility to deliver. [ Ukulele music continues ] [ Cheers and applause ] KAZ: Well, although people might see his career is a huge success, but to us, it's just a beginning. [ Mid-tempo music plays ] You know, I need to make sure that he's okay, healthy, eating, and sleeping. I forget to do those things. JAKE: She's just constantly working. If I tell her, "This is my goal. This is what I want to do," she's gonna -- she's gonna make it happen. [ Laughs ] I'm working, I'm working. JAKE: She sacrificed over 10 years of her life into what we're doing, and, you know, how do you... how do you make that up to someone, you know? I wouldn't be here if it weren't for Kaz. Yeah. No. I have no comment. [ Laughs ] He's a good boy. A very good boy. [ Both laugh ] I'm a good boy. Very good boy. KAZ: I'm looking at the screen. I couldn't believe my eyes. My hometown got destroyed. And the Japan that I know is gone. You know, I can feel it, you know? I can smell it and I can feel it, and this is my hometown, and I know this, you know, town. JAKE: You know, part of the school is being used as a shelter for a lot of the people in the area who lost their homes. [ Shouting in Japanese ] 1, 2, 3, 4. 1, 2. [ Speaking Japanese ] 1, 2, 3, 4. 1, 2, 3, 4. [ Speaking Japanese ] And stop! Ready, play. [ Singing in Japanese ] Okay, wait now. Get ready. [ Speaking Japanese ] 1, 2, ready, play. [ "Twinkle, Twinkle Little Star" plays ] And wait. [ Singing in Japanese ] Okay, and ready. Here we go! And... [ Singing continues ] Yeah! Good job! [ Applause ] There were times I would stop and kind of look at Kaz, you know, and... I mean, just looking at her -- at her face and her expression... You know, all these years, she's always taken care of me, and I think I realized that... you know, sometimes she needs to be taken care of. I'm glad that I could be there with her. You know, when I'm on stage, all I'm trying to do, and all I want to do, is just connect with people, and I want to be as sensitive as possible so that I can feel what they're feeling. Music communicates the purist form of human emotion. [ Soft ukulele music plays ] I always believed that music is so important, you know, and it's so healing, and I still believe that, you know, to a certain extent. But then you come across an experience like Sendai. You know, they still have no home. They have to somehow still support their family. You know, for me, I'm on the next plane to Hawaii and going home. That experience was a huge reminder to not take things for granted. Coming home is always special. Everything that's important to me is here. My mom and dad remain friends. My dad can still come by the house, and we can all still go out to dinner. You know, so I think it's very positive. [ Singing in Hawaiian ] Kailin, where's the baby? Where's the baby? Right there. Yeah. Oh, you felt it move. He gonna come to my house. Come to your house? Yeah. Yeah. We are expecting our first child, a boy. Baby boy. We really don't know too much about parenting, so we do have a lot to figure out. I'm so nervous. I don't know the first thing about being a dad. I still feel like a kid sometimes, you know? It's scary. It's supposed to look like this. [ Both laugh ] Oh, 'cause I think he just sits up in this and just bounces. I don't think he hangs from this. You don't think so? These are terrible instructions. There are gonna have to be changes with touring and my career and Kelly's career, but looking back at everything, being raised by a single mom and looking over my brother, the long-distance relationship with Kelly, I never really looked at those things as obstacles. You just make it happen because that's the only option. You know, with my mom, she really didn't have much of a choice. If it meant working two or three jobs, she did whatever she had to do. She taught me to focus on the things that really mattered to me... ...and when the time comes, you'll know what to do and you will do it. Good evening, everyone. I'm Jake Shimabukuro, and this is my ukulele, Belle. And tonight, we're gonna play for you a couple of songs, and... I'm not a professional or anything, so don't expect anything too great. [ Chuckles ] [ Soft ukulele music plays ]
