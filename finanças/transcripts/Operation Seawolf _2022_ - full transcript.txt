Somewhere in the Atlantic Ocean The torpedoes are all ready to fire. There she is. She's ready for launch. To the battle stations! Prepare for battle! Prepare for battle! -Captain! -Yes, my boy? Have a good hunt. Good job Hans. It will start soon. You are all trained for this. Alarm! Prepare torpedoes one and two for launch! -Captain?! -Fire-free! Torpedoes one and two! Fire-free! 45 seconds left. Captain, what's going on here? The ship is heading straight for us. -Will it ram us? -Yes. Full speed ahead! Quickly! We have to get to the surface immediately. And. Hurry up. Get off the boat. Then you can do it. Get off the boat! Instantly! Hauptmann! You're going to be a good captain, Kessler. It is my duty. US Navy High Command Norfolk, Virginia February 27, 1945 Sir, Operation Seewolf. The Germans prepare a torpedo attack with a submarine off the US coast. Are these German submarines with VI torpedoes? Looks like it sir. Who is this? Captain Hans Heinrich Kessler. 13th Fleet. Bearer of the Iron Cross. Fought in World War I and is very knowledgeable about submarines. He leads this wolf pack. He's a dangerous man. -Please keep me informed. -Yes, sir. TRONDHEIM, NORWAY ...we have now, however , carried out an upgrade, like the world has never seen. I have... ...after he refused... ... I have armed Germany in these five years. I spent billions the German people must know that now. I have... We have created the best anti-aircraft defenses and the best anti-tank defenses in the world. Through tireless work day and night. I've tackled all seemingly impossible problems with a firm will... Propaganda. There is only propaganda. I have to go. If this is all propaganda, then why do you have to go? -My duty. -What do you care about duty? Is this why you leave your love behind? I keep them as a reminder. Once this room was full of friends. But now there's only us left. How are you my friend? -Good? -Good. Gut. Mr commander. -Hail Hitler! -Hail Hitler! Even at the very end we remain soldiers. Gentlemen. I want to speak to him alone. I ask you. We have some things to talk about. And have little time. Come along. At your command. What are my orders, commander? What am I doing here? Let's get to the point. It's no secret that our submarines are doing poorly. The British and the Americans have set themselves the goal to destroy them completely. The leader is not satisfied. The Fuhrer would have needed more U-boats at the beginning of the war. I'll show you something Do you see that? -The American east coast. - New York City. Your war effort will start from here. Operation Seewolf. Our operations have all been unsuccessful. The V1 cruise missile. It's Hitler's miracle weapon. We will station these missiles on our submarines. And so the Americans attack. With this we terrify the enemy . I want you to lead the operation. At the beginning of the war we had sovereignty over the waters. Steel, blood, fire, fear. Those were our swords. Now we only dream of our "wonder weapons". And of victory. That's all we have left. The guide does not give us any additional staff. -I beg your pardon? -You heard me right. A pack needs wolves. I'll show you the wolves. stood still! your wolves. These aren't wolves. these are boys -Little boys. - We were the same age then. When the war started I practiced with my men for nine months before we went into battle. You've received the best education in the country. Do you know what to expect? You know the risks. They are willing to die for the country and for the leader. This is not the Kriegsmarine. Then make them a Kriegsmarine. I do Operation Seewolf. You will set sail with three boats. Seven more will join you later. Ten boats. They serve as a kind of spearhead for other boats. And who should we fight on the ground? Allied shipping lanes in northern New York. -And the target? - New York City. When does it start? The fleet is ready. We'll leave on the next high tide. I would like to see the boat and speak to the officers. I expected that! The officers of the U-546. Are you the lieutenant? Lieutenant Erich Reinhardt, acting captain of the submarine. Captain? We initially planned on Reinhard as captain, but... under your leadership he will gladly act as a substitute. Am I not right, Lieutenant? I am pleased to obey your command. -And the boats? -Lieutenant Lutz. -Is everything ready? -The machines are ready. Lieutenant Handel Spear. The crew is ready to leave. Good Good... Good. Then we'll take a look at my boat and have something to eat. Seewolf. -I want to speak to the commander right away. -Yes, sir. Commander? What is? Operation Seawolf begins. -Certainly? -It was just confirmed by Enigma. -Come. We have a lot of work ahead of us. -Yes, sir. In unprecedented millions of demonstrations the whole German nation has today to work, to their values, their moral ethos and known for their national solidarity. This evening is found across country, status and denomination differences, the whole German people together, to finally... -I'll take that off your hands. -Thanks. Well, Hans, the time has come. The ghosts stay here in the harbor. Now it's just you, the crew and the mission. Are you ready? If the crew is half as good as the boat then I'm confident. Under these circumstances. OK then... off to your second home. The sea and the ship. Good luck my friend. I wish you the same. stood still! move. I know you don't know me. I neither do you. But sailors are like brothers. The ocean binds us all together. We stand together for life and blood. We earn our worth deep under the sea. Each of you will do your duty. I will not disappoint you. Doesn't disappoint me either. -All hands to your posts. -Your command, Captain. All men to their posts! We're going out at six knots. Starboard, 108 degrees. Yes, captain. Lutz? The engines at six knots. Starboard 108 degrees. Captain, the boat is going at six knots. The engines are running as planned. The batteries are full. Fine, take it below the surface. And then accelerate. At your command. - Go into hiding! - Go into hiding. Our secret service has informed us the submarine left the port of Trondheim. They drive along the northern routes of the fishermen, so that they are not discovered. It's difficult to locate them that way . They are slow. We must position ourselves and intercept them. The tenth fleet and its destroyers are ready. Contact Commander Emitts. They should split up. Half will go north and half will go south. We don't take any risks. I love this wolf hunt. Yes, Sir. US Tenth Fleet Captain Samuel Gravely Jr. on USS PC-1264 Four degrees port, full hard rudder. keep her calm Aye aye sir. Four degrees port, full hard rudder. Captain, Emmits for you. And, Sir? Thanks sir. starboard. hard rudder. Ten knots. -A new course? -Operation Teardrop is now underway. -We're really chasing submarines now? -The hunt is on. Yes, Sir. -helmsman. -Aye, aye, sir. Don't be silly, wimp. - Do you maybe have something for me? -No, shut up. What I wouldn't give for a good beer right now. Are you ready for battle, my soldier brothers? -Yes / Yes. -We will defeat them. I have a sack full of potatoes here. And I have chocolate too. -No no. -Great. -Good this way? -Yes, well done. And and. Sorry, Captain, I haven't had a chance yet to take out my personal belongings. Hitler Youth? "This blood is full of honor." It's my brother's. He was killed by the Americans in Normandy . I'm sorry to hear that. Lieutenant. I know I took command of the boat away from you. You are my second in command. You must obey my orders without exception. -Is that clear? -Yes, Captain. We must do our duty on this boat . Under my command all that counts is that the crew survives and we defeat the enemy. And safety on board. Roger that? -Roger that. -Good. How is it going? The U-894 falls behind. -And why does she fall behind? -The engines. Inform U-578 of this by radio. At your command. Keep them on track. We can't waste any more time now. At your command. Are you asleep yet? Good night. I think I'll lie down now too. Thank you very much. -What do you want with that? -What? Do not hurt me. Don't make me. I've never had a knife. My family was too poor for that. The money was too tight. How's the new captain? He moved into my cabin. We're all on your side. For men like Kessler... the time is long gone. Keep the engines running. I want a report every half hour. command from above. -Hail Hitler! -Hail Hitler! Hail Hitler! Helmsman, starboard, 20 degrees. And stay the course. Lieutenant, we're receiving sound signals. -From the surface? -I think so. -What's happening? -We have contact with the enemy. How many boats are there? Reinhard, how many?! One moment! Should I take this to the captain? Not yet. Reinhardt, come on! There are several ships. And they come to us quickly. The other submarines have confirmed it. -I have visual contact. -A convoy? And. The U-578 wants to attack. What can I tell them? This will be our first loot. We can't decide that. But the captain. I order the attack. At your command. Now call the captain. At your command. Why did the engines stop? Captain! We have contact with the enemy. A convoy. merchant ships. U-578 begins attack. On whose orders? -The torpedoes were launched! -Captain, torpedoes fired! -The periscope. drive it out! -Extend the periscope! A hit! You have been hit! And! Another hit! -There was another hit! -Yes! Where are the torpedoes? All hands to battle stations. Get ready for battle! All hands to battle stations! All hands to the battle station! Sir, our convoy was hit. From a submarine. -Where? -Sector 4-7-3. Our men. We need the birds in Greeley. -All available forces should go there. -I'll pass it through. -You should hurry. -Yes, sir. Los! The snorkel worries me. We should get to the surface urgently. -What about him? -Hard to say we should go upstairs. Tell the engine room. -Yes? -Are the batteries charged? -Unfortunately not enough. -And the engines? We should check that out on the surface. Okay. What's going on here? The batteries are not charging properly. We have to go up. It's probably the snorkel. Well, up with her then. Otto! Inform the other boats that we are going upstairs! At your command! Wake up the deck crew! -Bring us to the surface. -At your command. Where's the captain? He's sleeping. Keep her calm! There's no way I want anyone to go overboard. We have a problem! -And what? -Come see it. What's happening? We need the machine guns, now. To the guns! There are survivors. Are you sure? We can't take them. Let's shoot them. We can't take any chances. What shall we say to the captain? -He'll think it was his order. -Good. Is that a deck gun? -Yes indeed. -Who are they shooting at? There were lifeboats, I didn't want to leave any survivors behind. That wasn't my order. Survivors could give away our position. Idiot. We could be seen. Who exactly is supposed to be seeing us out here? planes! Bring the men downstairs. Come on! Everyone to the battle stations. We have to go under. The other U-boats are to withdraw immediately. engine room. 95 percent on both engines. Instantly. Da oben! Hurry up! They are coming! They are coming! What's happening? We are under attack. Fire-free! Stand up! We do not have much time! Speer? Speer! I'm sorry. I'm sorry. All hands below deck! We must dive immediately! Prepare everything! Come on, hurry up! -They attack us again! -Where are the others? They're dead. We need to... You have endangered the lives of the crew and the boat. Lieutenant Lutz! Arrest Lieutenant Reinhard -and have him guarded. -But... What orders do you want to follow? And now dive in! Go ahead! Sir, our planes attacked a submarine. -Which position? -Section 9-47-4. The fleet is to move towards section 14-55. -This is our chance. Go ahead. -Yes, sir! -Hard to port! -Hard to port! Sir, the U-578 has spotted more ships on the surface. Extend the periscope. Extend the periscope! The periscope is ready! -Bring it down to 50 meters. -What? These are destroyers. Go ahead. 50 meters, at your command. Albert, five up. Ten down. At your command. Listen to me. This is the captain speaking. We have visual contact with enemy ships. They're heading straight for us. Luckily we're still far enough away that their radar doesn't spot us. Maybe we'll make it past unnoticed. -Keep us on course. -At your command. We passed under them in seven minutes . seven minutes. And. Sir, I have something on my radar. -Correct to port 20 degrees. -Aye, aye, sir. Activate the depth charges and await my orders. Port 15 degrees, half speed and then normal rudder. Aye, aye, sir! Come on. Four minutes. Here please sir. Thanks. Sir, we have contact five degrees port. - Radio Jersey. -Yes, sir. -Fire the depth charges. -Aye, sir! Two minutes. Come on. Come on now. The grenade guns! Sir, they're all in the water. We have them! A submarine has just been shot down by the tenth unit. - Just the same? - Yes, Sir. The pack! -There is more than one. -Yes, sir. Keep chasing them. Come on! We're safe. Captain, we've lost contact with U-578. There's just a noise. We continue. We have an order. Stay on course at six knots. -It will be night soon. -At your command. The captain needs small arms. Two submachine guns. I need to consult first... Sir... The enemy boats have disappeared from the radar of the tenth unit. If there were any more submarines at all. You should go back to the coast. Inform the Coast Guard and double the responders. Yes, Sir. Officer! Say we're looking for the other subs. -At your command. -Our attack on the US coast - is imminent. -At your command! Captain, we have a problem. Was? Leutnant Reinhard. Stands still. Reinhard? stop! Lieutenant, pass me the pistol. And then we forget this incident. I killed these men. You're dead because of me. I have abandoned my ship. And my team. I failed you. Your failure is due to my weak leadership. hand me the gun I said: stop! In the first World War new submarines were developed. Many have volunteered. I was one of the few who were taken. On my first day on the high seas , a man fell overboard. I asked the captain if he wanted to have the man rescued. But he declined. On a submarine, every man is responsible for himself. Destiny decides everything. There is no turning back. It only goes forward. Every man on this ship has his mission to fulfill That also applies to you, Reinhard. Don't let the mistakes of your past determine your future. Your watch starts in five minutes. Los. Yes, captain. We have contact. -We're close to the coast. -Very close. Keep an eye on everything. Turn off the engines. At your command. -Where is Lieutenant Reinhard? -He's on guard. -I'll go up to him. -Is good. cold night. And how. If we continue to starboard, they won't notice us. Why? At night, the outline of our boat can hardly be made out. -A blind spot? -Yes. Let's continue starboard. At your command. Wandervogel. Was? As a little boy, I was a member of the "Wandervogel". I already heard about that. -Good. Go on. -At your command. The Tenth Fleet to the south has just sunk three U-boats. -And in the north? -No change, sir. That means they could... they could attack from that side. The closer they get, the better we can locate them. Captain, the engines are running at 100 percent. We should arrive in New York tomorrow. -Any news from the other submarines? - Not so far. How long will it take to set up an attack on deck? Guess like five, six hours to get the missiles up on deck. We don't have time for mistakes anymore. We will not allow ourselves any more mistakes. I have visual contact with ships, Captain! -Trade ships? -Looks more like Navy ships. Captain, the radar shows many ships. They are fast. Get ready for battle. All men in their places! They are all starboard. -These are American warships. -Have you seen us? Not yet. But probably soon. We need the torpedoes. We're targeting the merchant ship. -Are we attacking them? -Yes, Lieutenant. -Come on! -At your command! The torpedoes are ready for launch. Port 90 degrees. -port 90 degrees! -Port 90 degrees. Fire the torpedo. Fire torpedo one! Fire-free!

We go down 150 meters, four knots. let's go Any news from the fleet? When they arrived , a merchant ship was near them. -And otherwise? -One destroyer, the Coal, was sunk. The fleet has initiated rescue operations. New York could be attacked by German missiles tomorrow morning . All Southern fleets to New York Harbor. Just to be safe. Haskel, find this submarine. That's an order. Yes, Sir. Radio that to headquarters. At your command. The German Navy had prepared for these attacks long beforehand . General Eisenhower has announced that the Allies are moving over the northern and Eastern Channel join together to fight the enemy together. It is reported from the Führer's headquarters that that our Führer, Adolf Hitler, this afternoon in his command post in the Reich Chancellery, fighting to the last breath against Bolshevism, fell for Germany. On the thirtieth... A message from Kessler. He's almost to New York. Does he know? He 'll find out soon enough. Why did you choose Kessler for this assignment? Kessler lost everything. There is no better... than a man with nothing left to lose. Hail Hitler! We are there. New York. Lieutenant Lutz, you did a very good job. Thank you for that. Thanks. Hauptmann! Must be a great view. New York City. Do I have permission to go upstairs? Permission granted. This is our chance. I've never seen anything like it. She is difficult to describe. Have you seen her yet? Yes, at the beginning of the war. Did we ever have a chance to win? no We have our orders. Hey Reinhard. Take that. Naturally. ...the latest news from overseas compiled for you. Breaking news just came in. Independent sources have confirmed Adolf Hitler's death. Apparently he committed suicide... let's go down -Did you hear that on the radio? -This is for you personally. Admiral Dönitz gives the order to lay down the guns. And wait for further orders. Does the team know? Not yet. Is it true? Hitler is dead? -I think so. -Propaganda? American propaganda is not like ours. What should we do? Have the men prepare the rocket. -But the admiral said... -We should wait for further orders. But if we're going to move on, we should be ready. The team should prepare as best they can. I will arrange it. This is our chance. We are ready. At your command! This is the captain speaking, listen: We are at the enemy's gates. We're ready to attack. Oh thank you. Nights like this can be damn long. -What is? -Hitler is dead. It has been confirmed. It's over. -Sir? -And? - Kessler. -What about him? According to his file, he lost his family in the bombing of Dresden. -Is that true? -Yes. He has nothing to lose. He doesn't care about Hitler. Alert the fleet. Sir! I miss you. Captain, she's ready. You did a good job, lieutenant. stood still! Men, each of you should be proud to be a German. You are the real Kriegsmarine. Hauptmann! We have contact. They come towards us. -Who exactly? -The US Navy. You have found us. Are we close enough to the coast? In order to launch the rocket, we have to get even closer. The distance is too great. What's your order? -Sir, we have contact. -Is it her? Yes, Sir. Prepare for battle! -Prepare for battle! -Prepare for battle! Men, Hitler is dead. We have two options. Give up... or fight. We fight with you. We fight. Helmsman, keep the boat at 93 degrees. Six knots. -At your command! -Prepare for battle! -Prepare for battle! -Prepare for battle! -Sir, you've made contact. -And? The fleets are located at the agreed location. We made it. Schachmatt! Schachmatt! Sir, the signal is getting stronger. is it getting closer Sir, it's coming straight at us. In this course we meet the warships. We go under. We dive! Watch out for the shallows. But stay the course. You will see us at this course. They can't drop their own depth charges that close. Accelerate. Eight knots. At your command. Accelerate! At eight knots! -Something new? -No. That was their tactic. What? As? Captain, the submarine is heading straight for us! -Get your weapons ready. -Yes, sir. You heard him, ready your weapons, go! Captain! The weapons don't have enough range. Sir! She will get away! I do not believe that. Now we are ready! And! Listen! There are more ships on the radar. Captain, the rest of the fleet has arrived. Just in time. How far? -We're close enough. -Let's take a chance and show up. -Blow tanks! -At your command! Blow on tanks! Tanks anblasen! Captain! The submarine has surfaced. -What? Do they attack? -Come! Do they attack? -They're about to fire. -And with what? With a rocket. With all due respect, sir. I would like to see my mom again. I'll take you to your mom. Hauptmann! "This order goes to all boats." "Abandon mission. Surrender. Surrender." It is too late. Sir, the submarine has surfaced. The fleet awaits your command. What should they do? Blow it up. Hauptmann! -We must abandon ship immediately. -Get the men overboard. Captain! Come on. A captain sinks his ship. That is my duty. Are you going. Los! Thank you. "Any captain of honor can make his own destiny not separate from that of his ship. Only by my own death can I prove that the German forces were willing to die for their country. You are a young man, Reinhard. You have a long life ahead of you. Make the most of it. As I told you before: Don't let the mistakes of your past dictate your future. Captain Hans Kessler, Navy
