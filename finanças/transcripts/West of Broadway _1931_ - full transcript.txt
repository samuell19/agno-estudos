The words is different. Yeah, everything's different now, Swede, but back home... ...we've got to clean the mud off our boots and the dirt from the songs. # The French they are a funny race # # They fight with their feet and... # No, no, you mustn't sing that. You're too sick. Listen, Swede, I'm not sick. I'm a trifle indisposed. I've been on too many tea parties. Great social whir, bridge luncheons, you know. Touch the nerves perhaps, but I'm not sick. But you've got a temperature that yumps, the nurse told me that. Temperatures have got to "yump". If they didn't, you'd be done for. Oh, I wish I had a temperature that yumps. Well, try "yumping" right out of here and do what I told you, will you? - But you... - Now get going or I'll be sorry... ...you ever picked me up in the Argonne. I didn't pick you up, I just wanted to bury you. That's what I had the shovel for. You didn't even know how to handle a shovel. I can still feel it sticking between my ribs. But you were supposed to be dead. A soldier should always be what he's supposed to be. Get out of here before I wrap this cot around you, will you? Alright. Be a good fellow, Doc. I gotta get off at New York. Now, I'd like to let you go, Sergeant. I want to get off this ship myself. But there'll be a girl waiting for me at the dock. You don't want her to get fallen arches just standing around, do you? She's waited eighteen months, one more won't hurt her. - I know, but the agony to me. - Yeah. That's just what I'm thinking about. Four machine gun bullets on the shoulder, and a whiff of gas. Now that's no hard for the lungs. You may have to do a hitch out west. They'll decide at the Base Hospital in Philadelphia. - Philadelphia? - Uh-huh. But you don't seem to realize, Doc, I'm engaged to this girl. Even if you were divorced from her, I wouldn't let you off this ship. # Mademoiselle from Armenti?res # # Parlez vous # # Mademoiselle from Armenti?res # # Parlez vous # # She likes to play with all the boys # # When she makes the docks # # Hinky Dinky parlez vous # Jerry. Did you get them? Give them to me quick. When that guy finds out he ain't got any pants... Hey! Who stole from me my pants? My pants! Listen, I'm going to kill somebody! Jerry, I think you're crazy to try a stunt like this. - You are too sick. - Anyone coming? No, it's alright. But how are you going to get ashore? What does it matter? What does anything matter as long... ...as long as I see her? How you know she'll be at the dock? She'll be there. She won't fail me. Well, it looks like she ain't here. Something must have happened. She'd surely be here. Oh, you don't know her, Swede, she's the most wonderful... I've been hearing about that all the days since Ch?teau-Thierry. It's the only thing that kept me going, the thought of coming back to her. In the meantime, where do we go from here? We'll take a taxi to her apartment. - I wait here. - Okay. Hey, buddy, come on out. - Got a smoke? - Sure. Say, was you ever in Minneapolis? - Where's that? Jerry. I'm so glad to see you. You've been dreadfully ill, haven't you? I mustn't keep you standing. Oh, I'm all right. Come in. I suppose there were a million people at the dock. Yes, I suppose there were. I... I meant to get there myself, but... - I wasn't sure of the time and I... - I didn't expect you. Of course we're all enormously proud of you. We read all about you in the newspapers. About your being wounded... and the decorations they gave you. They came to the hospital to give you the Legion of Honor, didn't they? What's the matter, Anne? Why, nothing, I... Yes there is, Jerry. I... You don't have to tell me. I know. You don't want to go through with our engagement, do you? - I'm afraid I can't. - Oh, this makes it easier for me too, Anne. It's a relief for both of us. No regrets and... ...and they lived happily ever after. - Jerry. - Oh, it's all right, Anne. You're not fooling me for a moment. I know. And I'd give anything in the world if it could be different. Of course. I almost wish you hadn't taken it like this. If you'd raged and sworn and told me what you thought of me, I... I could have... But this way... Well, if it would... help any I might hand you a nice black eye. Jerry... You'll forget all about me. Of course I will. Well, you needn't be so emphatic about it. All the... happiness in the world... Well, is everything alright? Yes... swell. Where to? We better get him to a doctor. Alright, alright. Hello. Hello. Yeah, this is Maizie. Oh... Waking me up this time of night, what do you think I am, a fireman? I wouldn't get out of bed to go riding with Paul Revere. Who? Jerry Stevens? No, I never heard of him. Oh! That's different. I've always got time for a millionaire. Yeah... uh-huh. Well, sit on your tail light for a second. Dot! Hey, Dot, wake up. We've got a date. - When? - Now. - Who with, a milk driver? - No. With a guy that's loaded with dough. And we ain't got breakfast money. Oh, that's alright, I'm getting used to that now. And another thing, our landlord ain't so friendly. He gave me a look this morning that almost curled my hair. Oh, alright. Well, this is a fine time of the night to have to pet some old dope for ham and eggs. Okay, Charlie, but remember, we don't take checks. Hello. I don't mind if you close that door. I like them open. They're easier to get out through. Keep the line of retreat clear, hm? - Not bad. - Yeah. I'm tired of window-jumping. You raise bumps in the sidewalk when you land. Say, are you throwing this chowder? I'm what's facetiously known as the host. Well then, why don't you agitate among your guests? Or don't they have the right dope in the graphic? - Do you advise me to? - No, not after my experience. There are a lot of handy men down there. Well, they're all strangers to me too. Yes, they wouldn't be that familiar with you. No. Say, what brought you here? My roommate. She sold me the idea that I might do a little golddigging on the premises. Who was that prospective victim? - You. - Me? Well, why not? You don't know, mister, what tough lives we working gals lead. Why, even now there's someone waiting at home for me, old, and worried, and suffering. - Mother, I suppose. - No, my landlady. We're ten days behind in the rent. But you're honest anyway. In conversation only. You're a blonde, too. Eagle eye sees everything. You said something about... Rent. Yeah, I did drop a hint. If that'll be of any help. Yes! No. Ten minutes ago I wouldn't have minded hooking you. But... since I told you... it'd be cheap kinda. - And you don't like to be cheap. - Not any more than I can help. How would you... ...would you really like to drop into the St. Regis Roof? - With who? - Me. I'll do anything once. Almost anything. Let's go. I'm pretty tired of this. Am I surprised! Don't you think now that now we're going to paint the town red, we ought to start in properly? - Curious again, eh? - Not exactly. Oh, just a sweet fatherly kiss. Well, come on. And if it's fatherly, I'll kick you right in the shins. Men always do that in books, don't they? I suppose so. Men are usually gentlemenly in books. And gals are lovely ladies. Lovely. Pretty here, ain't it? Very. You know, you'd make a rather charming widow. Black becomes you. Neat figure too. You telling me? I've seen myself in a bathing suit. Say, there's a dame over there trying to give you the high sign. You mustn't say dame. Well, I know, you point with the little finger. - Your package, sir. - Okay. No, thanks. That's a pretty hefty hooker, handsome. I'm not even drinking tonight. Gee, I'd hate to see you when you're off the wagon. It's too bad, Jerry's going the pace. In the right company too. She's pretty. In a shoddy way, yes. - Dance? - Yes. Lay off, won't you? You don't want to have those big baloon tires under your eyes, do you? Is she the big disappointment? Huh? The big used to one, the heartthrob. You express it perfectly. The "used to" one. - She had you? - Yep. Some saps don't know when they're lucky. - Would you? - I'll say I would. I'm lucky to be here and I know it. Thanks. You know, I'm beginning to like you a lot. That'll be enough. Fun's fun. But from now on we say it with laughs. Hello, Jerry. Glad to see you around again, I heard you were ill. Nothing at all, a touch of the flu. I'm splendid now. Oh, Dot, this is Anne. Anne, Dot. Dot the "i" and cross the Anne. Or is it the double-cross? I forget. - Pleased to meet you. - How do you do? And this is Tony. How do you do? Oh, Jerry, you'll be getting your wedding invitation soon. I out your name high on the list. Let's drink a toast. To your happiness... Anne and Tony. That's nice of you. You might return the compliment. Drink to my marriage. - Your marriage? - Mine and... Dot's. It's that way with us. Isn't it, darling? Yeah... Oh, why... sure, yeah! Well, good luck. I hope you'll be very, very happy. Thanks. When I get married, I won't worry so much about me being happy. Congratulations, Jerry. Yes, I'm pretty lucky. - Shall we dance, Tony? - Yes, let's. That was a good act alright, but I don't think it got over. She'll believe it when she reads it in the newspapers. Please don't. A know you got a skin full and you're just saying things, but... Don't. Well, why not? You're a cute kid. You've been nicer to me than any girl I've ever known. Yeah... but the girls you've known are used to the things that give me the whirligigs. - Like what? - Oh... like this place. You know, the things you read about. That you know you're never gonna have. Why, you're a mess. Well, if you can't live the way you want to, you gotta to dream it. And square. Yes, I am square. I may look like someone who gives out the glad eye... But I'm so darned square it'd shock you. I believe you are. Well, how about it? We'd better get going. You'll have me ruin my mascara in a minute. - Herbert. - Yes, sir. Tell them to play Mendelssohn's wedding march. Thank you very much, sir. Right away, sir. Where to, Mrs. Seevers? Oh, stop saying things like that. I'm trying to give you a break but you make it tougher for me than... My dear, I'm not at all certain I did the right thing marrying those young people. The fellow appears to have been drinking. Poor kid. All that coin. And all he can get is just to have himself some brandy. But you're going off the liquor, you hear that? You're going to straighten yourself out, and I'm gonna help you. Yes, I am. I'll make you a better wife than them society dames. And some day... I'm gonna make you love me. Ain't I, Jerry? Some day I'm gonna make you love me. Well, you haven't told me yet how you came to hook this wealthy fish. No, I didn't hook him, Maizie, it was his own idea. I'd like to get some guy drunk enough to want to marry me. You know, Maizie, I'm afraid I fell for this guy. Don't make me laugh, I'll get a run in my stocking. I'm not kidding. Why, I'd have gone for him if he didn't have a dime. - Hello, honey. - Hello, Jerry. - Oh, Jerry, this is Maizie. - Hello. How do you do? Well, I was pretty well slacked last night. Yeah, when you started to see those pink elephants, I thought I'd have to call for an animal trainer. You're a nice girl. And I'm terribly relieved. Now you're going to look at matters sensibly, aren't you? What are you driving at, Jerry? Well, any settlement you want will be made, of course. And a divorce will be arranged quietly. Well... I don't want a divorce. Oh... I know this was all my fault. And I'm sorry. Oh, but listen, Jerry. I can't say it the way I should maybe, but... I'm in love with you. Now be reasonable. This was a gin marriage. Well, you were ginned up, but I wasn't. I know, and I've got the morning-after headache. And I'm willing to pay for it liberally. Now, that seems fair to me. It would be if I was in that business, but... I'm not. Can't you see, Jerry, I love you. Smarter than I thought. There's more in it for you being Mrs. Jerry Seevers, hm? Well, it won't work. Listen, our marriage is straight and square. You can't laugh that off. No, but a good lawyer can. Now, you take my advice and accept a nice big generous settlement. But I don't want a settlement. Now, look, monkey, there's no reason for you and me quarrelling. Here's a couple of hundred. And here's my lawyer's card. And goodbye. Well, this don't look so hot. He's got me doing it too. - Say, what is all this? - You and I are leaving for Arizona now. - Arizona? - Not so loud. But what has happened? This crazy kid has taken this marriage thing seriously. - Sure, but you know that... - I'm in a jam. I have to get out of town right away. Where's your hat? That's alright, kid, don't cry. He wouldn't have fired his cook the way he did me. No, but he wouldn't have paid his cook this much either. Oh, Maizie, I'm in love with him. I know I'm crazy, but I love him. He can't do this to me, I won't let him. I'll fight him. I'll fight him! Well, home again. We ain't changed a thing, everything's just the way you left it. So I notice. Where's that Chinaman? Wing. Maybe he's down at the bunkhouse. Oh, your rooms are ready. Hope you get some sleep. Sleep. - All right. Thank you, Mac. Good night. - Good night. Oh, good night, Mr. Axelson. Who, me? Oh, yes. Good night, Mr. Foreman. Where is the bunk? Any room you like. Take the hallway on the left. I think you better come to bed too. Yes, I'll be right up. Hey, Swede. Pretty decent of you coming out here with me like this. Oh, I just come along for the ride. And it's only a short walk from here to Minneapolis. Don't stall. I know you wouldn't let me come out here alone. Well, maybe not with all them bottles. No, this place wouldn't be so hot for a man alone without a regiment of brandy. Well, thanks, you're a swell Swede. All Swedes is swell. You should see my girl. Well, the swell part goes both ways. - Good night, Sergeant. - Good night. Welcome home. How did you get here? They're still running airplanes from Chicago. Unfortunately some of them arrive. Oh, you don't mean that, Jerry. You're just sore because I put something over on you. Yeah, and it isn't he first thing you put over on me. Oh, don't be so hard and tough. You were so nice and so kind to me that night. I didn't marry to put something over, honest I didn't. You'll have to clear out of here. But if I dom it'll be because I'm thrown out. That would be okay for the neighbors to chew over, wouldn't it? Your joke isn't funny. You're occupying my room. - I'm your wife, ain't I? - For the moment. But as long as I am, that's where I belong. Then obviously I belong somewhere else. Well, this is certainly a nice homecoming for a bride. What's this coming? - Howdy, cowboy. - You said it. Kind of slow here, ain't it, buddy? What kind of trouble are you hunting? Oh, I don't know. Out west it's supposed to be wild and... Ain't you got any indians? Indians? You know Sitting Bull? Do I know Sitting Bull? I was there the day he stood up. Swede! - Let's go. - Alright, boys, I see you later. You look terrible this morning. How do you feel? - Terrible. - That's just the way you look. - Don't mind about me, have you seen her? - Who? - My wife. - No. - She's here. - No! - And she says she's going to stay. - No! Don't keep on saying no, I say yes! - Now we got to get rid of her. - What do you mean "we"? Boy... Say, you! Say, I'm talking to you! Boy! No callum boy. Moustache. I'll call you worse than that if you don't rustle me breakfast. Breakfast all gone. Well, you go out and cook some, and quick, savvy? - Boss no say. - Well, I'm Mrs. Boss. I'm his wife! - Mr. Seevers catchum wife? - Plenty. Now you shake yourself out in that kitchen and "catchum" breakfast. You know, I'm going to have to cut down on my drinking. I'm beginning to have hallucinations. I could have sworn last night I saw that blonde around here. You remember that hard-boiled dame. Don't mind me. Well, I'm grateful for one thing. I don't have to cut down on my drinking. Drinking in the morning, eh? That's a bad sign. Do you always do things that are bad for you? I seem to. Say, Swede. Go and get a car and take this lady to the station, will you? Tell your funny-faced friend he needn't bother. - I'm not going anywhere. - Oh, yes you are. - Oh, no I'm not. - You're pulling out on the next train. Yeah? Now I'll tell one. It seems there were two travelling men... Oh, yes, I know that one. And the farmer had a daughter. And he said... Listen, what are you after? I'd rather talk private. Swede, get that car, will you? And take a ride around the block. Now, what do you want? What is it we all want, mister? Name it, you can have it. I told you in New York to see my lawyer. You're talking about money, I'm not. Oh, I suppose you're looking for the bluebird, and happiness. - Maybe I am at that. - You'll have me in tears in a minute. You said I was hard-boiled. Say, compared to you. Oh, you're just a wide-eyed child, I know. Life's treated you shabbily. Now get this. I told you in New York I'd pay you to clear out. You thought you'd play a smarter game. But the police might call it blackmail. Yeah? You don't think you can make this marriage stick in any court, do you? - A woman of your kind? - A woman of my kind. Some day you'll be sorry for that. Oh, come on, get down to business. Just think of it. That night I... I fell for you, hard. - Funny, ain't it? - Never mind the sentiment. - Right. - What's your price? I'll tell you in advance anything over $2 is pure philanthropy. Come on, I'll call your bluff. - No bluff, I'm gonna stay that's all. - Well, you're wasting your time. The doctors told me the day I got back from France I only had six months to live. Six months, eh? Suits me fine. That won't be long to wait. And you did say I'd make a swell-looking widow. Thanks for the tip. You're making me anxious to cheat the doctors. You haven't got the nerve. I told you so. It ain't bugs that's got you, it's liquor. Say, listen, I can stop drinking right now if I want to. And if I thought it would cheat you, I would. No you wouldn't. You haven't got it in here. There you are, boyfriend. Drink yourself to death and make Mama rich. So I haven't got it in here, huh? And the next drink I take will be to celebrate the day I get my divorce. Then you're gonna be thirsty for years and years. Gee, there's something about these mountains that makes you feel... ...awful small. Yeah. I... You what? Well, it isn't any of my business, but... I'm afraid you're homesick. You can't be homesick if you haven't got a home. - But you... - Never had a home. - Oh, excuse me, I... - That's alright. You know, most anything I might say... would sound as if I was speaking out of turn, but... There's some of us around here knows you ain't having such an easy time. And if there's anything I can do... anytime. Thanks, Mac. I gotta be getting along. There goes your horse. Whoa! Oh, I forgot to put the reins over his head. If you're not back in an hour, I'll take a streetcar. Alright! Horse throw you? Sorry to treat you out of a laugh. Nope. Just walked out on me. Mac's been chasing him for more than an hour. They must be in Mexico by this time. - Well, I can't leave you here. - Afraid the wolves will get me? I suppose you think no self-respecting wolf would want me. Hurry up, I don't want to waste the whole afternoon. - Hurry where? - Get on my horse. - Oh, I couldn't take your horse. - Come on. - No. - Now don't be a little fool. The ranch is ten miles away. Listen, I'm a sport. I lost my horse, that's my hard luck. I won't take yours. Well, if you're going to be so tough about it, we'll both ride. - Okay. - Put your foot in that stirrup. Grab onto the pommel here. Swing around. You all right? I think maybe I'd better hold on. Do you have to squeeze so hard? You don't have to let go altogether. Say, make up your mind. I just don't want you to roll off, that's all. Do you think I'm doing this just for the thrill? Where were you when your horse ran away? Talking to Mac. Picking up cowboys socially, huh? - Mac's a regular guy. - Just the type for you. - Stop this horse. - Why? I'll walk home. It'll probably be the first time. Say, you can't make a crack like that to me! Come on, don't act like a wife, get on this horse. Oh, go chase your cow. # Poor lonesome cowboy # # Poor lonesome cowboy # # I'm a poor, lonesome cowboy # # And a long way from home # # I ain't got a mother # # I ain't got a father # # I'm a poor lonesome cowboy # # And a long way from home # Oh, I think Jerry's been a pig. Here all week without letting us know. He may not have wanted to see anyone. I'm afraid you'll find him considerably changed. Poor darling. How you do, how you do, how you do? I believe Mr. Seever is expecting me. - Judge Barham. - Mr. Seevers no come home. We'll wait, thank you. What a lovely home. And look at that view. - It's grand, eh? - Heavenly. - Cigarette, yes? - There are some here. Well, if it isn't Anne. With her face practically to the wall. Serves her right, I should say. And when he finds out she's not going to marry Tony... - Well, I mean. - Yes, but you see, um... - Unfortunately... - How do you do? How do you do? I'm Mrs. Seevers. I haven't had the pleasure of meeting Jerry's wife. Jerry's wife?! - Forgive me, I hadn't heard. - Oh. You see, the wedding was rather a surprise. Nobody was more surprised than me. These are old friends of Jerry's. They're staying in a hotel. Mrs. Trent, Miss Main. - How do you do? - Pleased to meet you. - How about some tea.? - Thank you. - Thank you. - Thanks. Got a match? Yessum, Miss. Move your celestial body and catchum tea. - Yessum. - In a big hurry. Yessum. I, um... I beg your pardon? I was just about to inquire after Jerry's health. He doesn't talk about it much. The doctors in New York said his only chance was to come West and stop drinking. Well, he came West. Hello. - Jerry, darling! - Edith. Hello, young man. You're looking remarkably well. What a dog you were not to have let us know you were here. - Well, I... - Awfully glad to see you, Jerry. Barbara. - Tea? - Thanks. Perhaps the ladies, um... Oh, I get you. I ain't had much practice yet. It doesn't take much. - You're a judge, aren't you? - Uh-huh, Judge Barham. Gee, I never met a judge socially before. I'm a family lawyer. Yeah? Are you here friendly or on business? Both, I trust. Family business? You might call it that. Well, I'm the family now. Good morning, Judge. Oh, Judge. - Tea? - Yes, thanks. No sugar. Lemon, of course. Oh, Jerry, I have some perfectly lovely scandal for you. Who do you think have decided matrimony is not for them? - Anne and Tony. - You always did bring me good luck. When can we discuss this family business? - The sooner, the better. - Brandy? I thought you might want to celebrate ahead of time. Tea, thank you. Oh, you're going to wait. I tellum you before not to steal my milk. But I got to drink milk. I got a little bit indiyestion. You know, indiyestion. - No catchum. - You can't catchum, I gottum. - In here, indiyestion. - Ah, no savvy. Look, you cookum, I eatum, now I gottum. - Gottum what? - Indiyestion. No coockum indiyestion. Oh, what's the use? The more I talk, the dumber you get. Don't you understand English? - You speakum? - I often wonder. Look. Me indiyestion, here, in stomach. - My stomach? - No, not yours, here. Oh, that feels good. Me. Do you likum? And you're a good cook too. E-N-G... English. G-R-A... English "Gramma"? - That's the only kind there is. - No, I had a Swedish "Gramma". She was 86 years old. But this book tells you how to speak English. Oh, you want to talk like an Englishman. I heard a lot of that on the other side. You and Jerry never talk about the war. - Was it pretty terrible? - Oh, no, I had a swell time. If it hadn't been for the war, I'd never have got out in Minneapolis. Was you ever in Minneapolis? You were with Jerry all the time, weren't you? Sure. The same machine-gun battalion. The same course, right on through it. What was he like? I mean, over there. Oh, he was the toughest sergeant in our division. But you wouldn't think so to see him now, the way he is. He could have been an officer a dozen times, but he don't want that. Yes, sir, that year he was a regular soldier. If he ever put on all his medals, he would be round-shouldered. Hi, cowboy. Hello, Mac. Excuse me, I just wanted to know if Mr. Seevers was home yet. Why, no. He didn't come home for dinner. Oh, he come back alright. He told me he was going to ride and ride until he got so tired... ...that maybe he could sleep tonight. I want to see him. Anything wrong, Mac? No, I just want to see him. Oh... won't you sit down? - No, thanks, I'll wait outside. - Mac! There is something wrong. Hiya, cowboy. There were three bottles of brandy in here, what became of them? Don't look at me, Sergeant, I didn't take them. You can smell me. - You haven't seen them? - No. - Where's that Chinaman? - Wing isn't here, it's his night off. - Anyway, I know he didn't take them. - Then you know who did. - No. - Stop stalling, where's that brandy? I told you I don't know. Why don't you leave things alone down here? I'm fed up seeing you try to play the lady of the house, I'm sick of seeing you around! Listen. Cut that! What do you mean? I don't like the way you talk to this lady. Mac, please. You don't li... Well you got a nerve! - Interfering with my... - I'm just telling you. You're not telling me anything. You're leaving now, get that? You're fired. - I take my orders from you. - Please go, Mac. Whatever you say. - I want a drink. - Have you had dinner? - I don't want any. - But you must have something. You haven't had a thing to eat all day. Please let me fix you something. It'll only take a minute. - What I want is a drink. - You haven't got the willpower, have you? - What do you mean? - You can't leave the liquor alone. I didn't think you could. # ...A Strawberry Roan # # I was hangin' 'round town # # Not earnin' a dime # # Out of a job # # Just spendin' my time # # A feller steps up and he said, # # "I suppose # # You're a bronc fighter man # # By the looks of your clothes" # # "I guess you're right, # # The best one, I can claim # # Rider of Ponies is my middle name # # Oh, that strawberry roan # Come in. # They say he's a pony # # That's never been rode # # And the guy that gets on him # # Is bound to get throwed. # Try to eat this, will you?

Tonight when I said I didn't know what became of those bottles of brandy... ...that was a lie. I took them myself. I didn't want you to drink. # They say he's old pony # # That's never been rode # # And the guy that gets on him # # Is bound to be throwed # # Oh, that strawberry roan! # # Last night as I laid on the prairie # # And looked at the stars in the sky # # I wondered if ever a cowboy # # Would drift to that sweet by and by # # Roll along, roll along # # Roll on little doggies roll on # I couldn't sleep and I thought you might be awake. Just one cigarette and... and I'll be going. I know what it is not to be able to sleep. No one to talk to. I'd like a puff. - Good morning. - Good morning, Judge Barnam. I'm afraid I'm a little early, but... I'm anxious to get this thing settled before I go back to New York. Yes. Of course you know this is to be a perfectly friendly agreement. The, um... ...the divorce can be secured later with the least possible unpleasentness. Now, I understand that you and Jerry discussed the settlement... Just a minute, Judge. Are you sure Jerry wants to go through with it? I mean, now. Have you any reason to believe otherwise? Well, no... only... Well, I don't know. Hello. Well? Well, you two look pretty serious for such an offensively fine morning. Jerry, we want to ask you a question. Well? Do you still want a divorce? Of course I want a divorce. Everybody wants a divorce. That's what marriage is for. Come on, let's have breakfast. But Jerry, this is serious. What do you mean? I mean... well, you... You don't really want a divorce, do you? Why, I thought we'd decided that days ago. Oh... Well, I think we'd better go ahead as we agreed. It's a perfectly friendly settlement. You know, all this would sound a great deal more pleasant over the breakfast table. It'll only take a moment. Now, in return for signing this paper you're to receive a check for $10.000. No, I want to be more generous than that. I want you to take 25.000. You see, I want to be sure that you're properly cared for. That you never have to go back to... To the life I came from, is that what you mean? Well, I... Give me that paper. There's no hurry about this, you know. There you are. Thanks. And now. That's that. Paid in full. - If you'll excuse me, Ill... - You're excused! - Take a good look. - What? You're looking at the prize sap of the world. No kidding! I laughed myself out, there's no laugh left in me. Well, you win. It took me a long time to get wise to you. But I certainly got you tagged now. We part good friends, I hope. Yeah. There's two wonderful things in my life that I'll always remember. The night I met you and the time I had smallpox. - Oh, thanks. - Don't mention it. - Mr. Judge wait breakfast. - Hm? - Mr. Judge. - Tell him I'll be there in a minute. Oh, Jerry. - Well, she's gone. - It's all right by me. I was kind of sorry to see her go. She was a good kid. Why don't you break down and have a good cry? I suppose you're glad to get rid of her. Delighted! Well, she won't be around to bother you no more. And she won't be here to take care of you when you get them heebee jeebees. And she won't be here to cook you things to eat and you don't get no dinner. If you don't mind, I'd rather not talk about it. Suits me. I wish she hadn't run away in the car because she don't know how to drive so good. You mean to say that she drove away alone in that car? I thought you didn't want to talk about her. I don't. I see. She drove away awful fast. But I suppose she was in a hurry to get to where she was going. Well, she got her money. My goodness, I near forgot. She told me to give you this. Hello? Oh, Maizie, you take it, I don't want to talk, it's him, it's Jerry. - What'll I tell him? - Oh, tell him anything. Tell him I've gone to China to start a laundry. Hello. Oh, hello, Jerry. This is Maizie. Dot ain't here. Oh, no, that wasn't her! I ain't seen her for a week. Honest I ain't! Aw, Jerry, I wouldn't lie to you. I'm a truthful gal, I am. That bird sure learned some language from them cowboys. Well, he'll have to learn a lot more than that to turn white. Hey, what's keeping you in there, you need any help? I can dress myself, big boy. All my clothes go on with zippers. And one way zippers at that. Maizie, I don't feel like going out. Well, I don't feel like starving to death either. Besides, Reg and Norm ain't so bad. And after all, a beafsteak don't care who pays for it. - Alright, I'll be ready in a minute. - Well, that's more like it. I'm tired of seeing you look like a bag of wet wash. - Hi, boys. - It's about time, beautiful. I had to fix myself up extra special for you, Reggie boy. - Hey, where's the other number? - Oh, Dot'll be out in a minute. Obliging? Well, ask her, she's over seven. Oh, hello! Oh, Dot, this is Norman. - How do you do? - How do you do? - And you know Reggie. - Sure she does. How about a little shot, Dot? Smooth as silk. - No, not just now, thanks. - Oh, come on, it's good for little girls. - It'll make your hair curly. - This is going to be a real party. Norm took some chips off the bankroll and is going to take us to the Follies. The Follies? Ain't that simply gorgeous? Eight bucks a gorge. Maizie, I got a headache. Oh, that's too bad. - I guess I'll be alright. - Atta kid. Come on, have a sip. Yeah... come on. Oh, sure, sure. I'd like to talk to my wife if nobody objects. Oh, yeah... How about a little drink for the girlfriend, Norm? A nice extra special Joe. Anything you say, baby. Dot, can we go in there for a minute? What for, lonesome again? That's unfair. I have some things I'd like to say to you privately. You've said your piece and I've said mine, privately and publicly. Here we are. An extra special Joe as specified. You don't want that. - Don't I? Come on, let's get going, Norm. - Atta baby! You're not going anywhere until I've talked to you. You wait and see. I'm going places, I'm doing things. - And you can't stop me. - I will. - Oh no, you won't. - Yes I will. Say, does this guy rate anything with you? Nothing. Well, you heard what she said. That goes. Sorry to be stubborn, but it doesn't. Now, you ain't gumming up my party, good-looking. Grab one of your other women for tonight. Must be plenty of dames kicking in to buy a... Quit you mugs, you'll get us all pinched. Look out, Jerry! Look out behind you. - Jerry! - Get him off me! And that's all, Your Honor. This seems an open and shut case. The defendant persists in annoying a lady and creating a disturbance. Hey, Jerry, here! Jerry, when I get your telephone call, I tried all night to find Judge Barham. - Order! - By golly, I... - Order! - Didn't you hear the judge? - I brought the judge with me. - Take off your hat! Oh, sure. Judge Barham, how are you? I apologize for this intrusion on the dignity of the court. Come right in, Judge. - How are you? - How are you? Glad to see you. Well, that puts a different aspect on the matter. Has the defendant anything he wishes to say? Thank you. I should just like to say that tonight is entirely my fault. I went to see my wife. I hadn't seen her in a long time. She didn't wish to see me. She had every right not to wish to see me. She's had a lot of trouble with me. I came tonight to tell her how sorry I was for everything... ...and to ask her to forgive me. I hope she will. That's all. Thank you. Under the circumstances, I place you under bond in the sum of $500... ...to refrain from molesting your wife. That's as lenient as I can be in the matter. Next case. The People versus Joe Williams. I want to talk to my wife. You can't talk to her here, it's contempt of court. You fixed things up beautifully, didn't you? Hey, you better take off that hat. Did you really mean what you said about asking my forgiveness? Will you let me try to pay you back for everything? With money? Don't kick a guy when he's down. And if it's a fatherly kiss, I'll... - Subtitles - Lu?s Filipe Bernardes
