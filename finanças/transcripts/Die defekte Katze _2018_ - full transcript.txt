Usually at the end of the letter you write with friendly greetings. With a friendly ... How do I remember everything? - That's right. Look. "Mit friendly greetings. " What does this mean? Something like worship. What? Farsi is not saying that. We say, "and to you the same." Sometimes your Farsi is strange. I know. Recently my mom told me, when I was 12, I refused to speak Farsi. Why?

What's wrong with her? I'll leave the door open. "If you come in here?" Just to sleep. She seems to have something to her. What? Some kind of a problem. So what? And you would prefer an animal, which behaves appropriately. How should an animal behave? Like all other cats. You mean, they all should be the same? Listen, Mina, my mother wants us to live a good life. And I want the same for us. How do you know what a good life is? It's because of the lamp. Are you afraid of the dark? We will do something about it. Good night sweetie. Just a little. While I'm falling asleep. Good morning. They seem to have opened a new club. Someone handed me this ad. Would you like to go? Dance?

Do you know how I felt? Again I was alone there. You know? I was alone, alone. If you are dancing, dance with me. I'm feeling sick. - Come on, Mina. You want disco, here you are disco.

All that's left is theory, but I will help you. Hey, you took his priority. Really? Yes, there are rules here. The one coming from the right has priority. Before the exam you should take a few more hours driving. Damn it. This is a patrol car. Mina, turn right at the front. Stop there and we will change. Better be brave. - Go, do not speed up. What will happen? If they ask, I will say I have a driving licence. It is not valid here. You must have a German one. I'll get it soon. At least slow down, please. Okay, they turned.

"But of course the closed door. Get out of here. Stop it. Enough! Who are you actually? Who are you? In what sense? When we met, you told me, that you have not been with anyone yet. In the clinic, it was not your first time, was it? Mina. - What to say? The Truth. I was with someone in Isfahan. Why not marry him? - That's a long story. He had a wife and a child. It all ended long ago. We are strangers. ... local anesthetic is not enough. General anesthesia is required. It is very important to sign here then. I'll be right back. Mina, what is it?
