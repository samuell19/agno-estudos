When warriors felt threatened, they resorted to rituals asking for prosperity in exchange for human blood. This was so in the Mexico of the Aztecs, and was so in the Mexico of the narcos. Rivers of blood were spilled to please the gods. Many years ago, when I started as a journalist... ...I witnessed brutality. What I saw does not leave me alone to this day. I was investigating the disappearance of a group of youths. A colleague had put me in touch with a member of the narcos who was willing to talk. I went alone to the appointment, at a motel by the highway. It was him. Spread your legs! What's this? It's to record the interview. Hey, hey, that can't be done. I need it, man, to-- No, no, what you need is to stay alive, to write. You know what they're going to do if they find this? Recording interviews, you will not last long. Sit down. Sit the fuck down! I'm here because I'm investigating the Moctezuma Bar case. Do you know something about it? Yes. I do. A lot. And I'm going to tell you everything. Do you know why? 'Cause I am fucked. 'Cause they are going to kill me. -Who? -Who? What does it matter? At first there were Zetas, Arellano Felix, Caballeros Templarios... But not now. It's nothing like that. Did you hear that? They might be outside waiting for me. Oh, shit! What happened at the Moctezuma? The boss wanted a ritual, so everything would go well. And then he called the Eagle Knight. And it was then that everything went to hell. The god of the earth opens his hungry mouth, to swallow the blood of many who will die in this war. The sun and Tlaltlecuhtli want to celebrate. They want to give food and drink to the gods of the sky and of the underworld, to give them a treat. The flesh and blood of those who have died. He told me how they kidnapped a group of youths who were their enemies' children but ultimately innocent. Well, let's take a walk. Wait here. The Aztecs made offerings to their gods of the heads of their enemies. During the conquest, some Europeans and even their horses ended up decapitated like this. Mexico... terror is here... and now. Where are we, José? Jaral de Berrios. This place is cursed. Don't worry. Those are just stories. That's the last of our water. Let me check. Move your hand. Easy. Once you see our loot, you'll forget about the pain. It's just a scratch. You'll have enough to buy that horse you wanted... and the land by the river to build your house. You could even steal... and marry... Odilún's sister. Don't tell me you don't love her anymore. She loves you very much. You're going to be all right. Here's your hat. Wait here. I won't be long. Martín? Martín? Why didn't you answer? Let's get out of here, José. No one will find us here. I'll go look for a place to spend the night. Martín! We have to go! Martín? Don't be afraid, bitch! I have a mission for you. You have to drain the blood of your sister's vagina! If you can't accomplish this in 12 hours, I will suck your soul through your anus! DRAIN Hey, mama! Don't suck on that bottle, suck on this milk! Mama, don't go away. I'm gonna bang your brains out! Babe, do you want it? I can give it to you. Goodbye, babe! Dude! You gotta tell me all the details. Of course, man! You'll be the first to know. Let's go! -What's wrong? -Start the fucking car! I was checking Google Maps to know if this is the way. Look, Javier, don't give me that bullshit! I hate when you lie to me! You stayed to chat, and I almost got raped! You don't know how to protect me! And you want me to go with you? My mom was right. You're too irresponsible to take care of me. Stop it, honey. You're overreacting. I'm sorry for not having gone with you, okay? I'll prove that your mom is wrong. You'll have the best night ever! You can choose any of the ten cabins. They're all empty. Nobody comes on weekdays. Did you skip school or what? We want the furthest one, please. That's the tenth but, like I said, there's no one here. It's quite private. The whole forest is yours. Honey! Javier, wait! I want to talk first. It's not even dark yet and we said this would be lovely. Yeah, you're right. I'm sorry. Tell me, sweetheart. I was so mad before because I want everything to be perfect today. And tomorrow I go back home as a new person. I will never forget this night, and I'm so nervous because I lied to my mom-- Hey! Shh. Shh. Everything's going well, right? You left school after call in your last class, and there was no traffic. Damn! Just look at this place. Damn! Just look at those lips. Did you bring condoms? Of course. Yes? Are you alone? We are. Why? What are you doing here on a Tuesday afternoon? There was a mistake. The hotel opens only on weekends. -You'll have to go somewhere else-- -Fermin! You'll feel better in town, with more people. What?! Forget it! We've already paid. Don't bother the guests. Mind your business. I'm sorry, he's quite old. Close the windows at night! Don't leave anything outside! I told you not to host people on weekdays. Yeah, whatever! No, wait! Touch me more. Not now! Motherfucker! You left these sandals out. Please, don't leave anything out, I'm serious. Is that why you knocked? It's our patio! No, the woods belong to others. They steal-- Are you serious? Strawberry condoms? What's wrong, honey? You'll like them, you'll see. I won't lose my virginity with strawberry condoms! I can get infected! But, honey, that has nothing to do with it! Let me tell you. There's a boy outside spying on us! Yes! I'm telling you! He ran off! Leave us alone! No, don't open it! What's that? I'll go see. No! Where are you going? Javier, don't leave me alone! Who's there? Javier? Javier, don't leave me alone! Valeria? -Javier! -Open the door! Valeria! Open the door! Get off the bed, Valeria! Open the door! I can't. He's under the bed. Valeria! Did someone bother you? Did they steal something? Where's Valeria? Valeria? Did they steal something from her? Her blouse or something? Where the fuck is Valeria? Did they take... her? Aluxes do not take people. They steal little things... and stuff. Unless they want to take something... from her. Valeria? Valeria! Valeria! I'm sorry! I'm sorry!

I am Rabbit, asshole! I am Rabbit, asshole! Your brother! Your brother! SEVEN TIMES SEVEN This is my town. My hood. Here I learned to play between cars, sell some merch... make my money... and survive. Nobody told me that life was easy. Instead... I still remember when my mother told me, "My daughter, life is a bitch. And you gotta be a bigger bitch than her, or she will fuck you over." Look at me now, Mother. Life can't even begin to drag me by the fucking feet. Because the bitch of all bitches... is me. Look. Even my business is international. Eh, Chinita? Weak women disgust me. I can't stand them with their pathetic faces. And that fucking smell of fear makes me sick. Those hags don't fit in this town. Where were you, Maya? Sorry, Doña Luz. I was helping my friend with-- Don't give me any excuses, baby. Or do you want another one of those? Yeah, beg for more! No, ma'am. I'm sorry. Don't play with me, bitch. Or I'll break you. Yes, ma'am. What are you all lookin' at? Get ready, let's go! Make yourselves pretty and cover up those scars! And take off those pathetic, worthless, wretched faces! Because today begins the first day of the rest of your lives. Welcome to La Candelaria. Today we celebrate tradition. The culture. The race. Today we celebrate... the Day of the Dead! Come over here, baby. Yeah, move it for me, babe. Shake that ass. Get over here, baby. Yes, shake it. Shake it! Don't touch me! What? You don't like this? Fuck! Come on, why don't you take this one back to the funny farm? She's a little off-balance! Made her look like she's tough, man. What's the matter, Chiquita? Does not speak English? Huh? Understand? Understand? Fuck off, bitch! Ooh, scared little monkey. Don't forget about me, babe. Don't worry. I didn't forget about you, motherfucker! Go to hell, you piece of shit! You will pay for this, asshole! I do speak English. Fucking idiot! Fucking whore! What the fuck is goin' on? Shut up! Coward! Who are you callin' a fucking coward? Justice can be one of the most gentle lovers. But revenge is a real fucking whore. DAY OF THE DEAD
