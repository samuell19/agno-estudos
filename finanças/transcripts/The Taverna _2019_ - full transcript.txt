Hi, Omer. Hello Jamila. You look beautiful. Thanks, but God, I don't feel it. Ah, this is how the world sees you. You are a gazelle. What you feel is for yourself, no? I have something for you. What is it? It's nothing. It's for your little girl. Oh, my God, that's so pretty. Ruby's going to love this. Thank you so much Omer. It's nothing. It's too much money, really. No, no, really it's nothing. Pink is her favorite color. - Really? - Yeah. Thank you, Omer. Namaste. Namaste. Lots of people tonight. More coming. Hello Jamila-moo. Hi, Kostas. How are you darling? Well, I didn't have a great day. No? No. Don't worry about it. Tomorrow will be better, all right. Just be strong darling. A lot of people. Yes, and I need you out there in about a half an hour. On table 12, six more people are coming. We're gonna make money tonight darling. I need it. You need it, we all need. You want more you poor Greek. Omer Lagas, Omer Lagas, he thinks I'm rich. With the money I'm paying you, I'm gonna close this room. I'm gonna go bankrupt. Here's your meat platter, you Greek pig. Thank you, you Turkish bastard. We love each other. Hi, baby. Hi. How was the hearing? Don't ask. Oh, trust me, I know the shit that you mean. Where's the white plate for table seven? One minute! Jesus, I can hear you. Well, you have your milk now sweetheart and do everything Jenny says, okay? Yeah. Well, daddy is very naughty, remember, and we don't like him anymore. That's right, Ruby. You have your milk now, okay? Yes. He lives with that wicked witch and maybe one day she'll fly away on her broomstick and then daddy will be able to come home. Yes, he will. Okay, sweetheart. I love you. Bye. Ladies and gentlemen, ladies and gentlemen. Hello again, hello. Tonight we have with us a very special guest all the way from Cairo, beautiful Zabella. Yes. This lovely girl was arrested in Cairo. You know why, because the thought her dancing was very sexy. She came here to Australia to find her life. First thing I tell her is here in Australia, you get arrested if not sexy. Anyway, apparently- - He's on drugs tonight. Tell him to fucking stop. Other plans. But she was because she had color skin, what? Okay, anyway. You will see with your eyes, no worries. And the next thing is that the person, the first person that gets up and dances with beautiful Zabella, has got an Ouzo on Kostas. Beautiful Zabella, ladies and gentlemen, yes. What do you think of her boy? She's hot. A young girl like that shouldn't have so many worries. I would ask her out, but my parents want me to marry a girl back in India with a dowry. And she's divorced with a child. So what? I can't be serious about her. My parents won't accept her. Why not? Well, because it's against our religion. You know what religion is boy? What? Fuck you, that's what. Maybe for you, easy to say. Yeah, yeah. What till it fucks you, then see. Wow. Aha. I you're in the trap. Oh, my God, Jamila is slacking it up out there. She is so good. Hey, I've got 41. Right, I need a ciggie. Have you caught it yet Omer? No. Bastard doesn't like chicken. They're like koalas bruh. They only eat leaves. Try some coslins. He thinks he's smart. What are you gonna do with it if you catch it? Put it in Kosta's car. Serious? Yeah, he will drive home with it. Oh, he's gonna shit himself baby. Don't say that crap about me being arrested in Cairo. I just said all these things out there for you to get more tips. I don't want any more shit out there. You know they're trying to make me look like a bad mother. Come on, come on, sit down. I'll fix you something to eat. Okay, sit, sit, sit, sit. Don't worry about anything Jamila. Success. Yes, girl, you were amazing. Thanks. Hey, I seriously wanna learn. It's easy. You should do lessons. Yeah. I know heaps of actresses that would love to add another string to their bio. How was your audition? Aw, thanks for remembering. It was great. They actually said that I was great. Great. I know, right? Like, I thought I was pretty good, but great was amazing to hear. When do you find out? Soon. I hope. How about you? Hey, if you need a character reference or anything like that, I am more than happy to help, okay? Thanks. Hey. I think everything's gonna work out. Thanks guys, have a great night. Hi, do you have a booking? Yeah, Rebecca. Yeah, sure just take a seat. - Thank you. - Thanks. Did you get legal aid? Yeah. It was so depressing. That bitch didn't even remember my name. I was just a case number. What hope is there really? Come on Jamila. They don't take a child from mother. Yes, they do. If you have money, the law is on your side. They made up horrible things about me Omer. I have read them. Even started to believe them myself. Everything will be okay. You can't say that, you don't know. You know what that cunt said to me? That I need to face the facts. I could lose custody of Ruby. What the fuck is she talking about? That's what she said to me. Jamila! I ran away from persecution and war, but not even in Turkey they don't do such a thing. It's all about the money here. They can buy Ruby from me. She's my little girl, but they can take her away for no good reason. So, that's a Greek salad, a meat platter for three, a seafood platter for two and you want the dips to come out first? Yes, why not. Okay, cool. Where are you from? L.A. honey. Kostas is gonna us into some serious trouble one day. Rebecca. Rebecca, welcome. Kostas, muah, muah. Come darling, you look so nice. Jesus. You come for the belly dancing, yes? Well, yeah a little. Yes, yes. Arman. Kostas. Great place. That's okay. Friend of Rebecca's is my friend. Okay, Arman, all right. So you eat. There is fantastic lamb tonight, very good. Drink and I'll be back. Rebecca darling, it's so nice to see you after such a long time, darling. Hey, you know your dancing tonight was excellent. I think you should be in Bolly movies. I wish. No, truly, you can be like Recka, "Forever Beautiful." Are your parents helping you? With money? Well, yeah. No. They're poor. I wish they were in Australia. They could look after Ruby so I wouldn't have to pay for a sitter. Must be really hard for you. Yeah, it is Samir. What do they think about your divorce? I'm not divorced yet, so they don't know. But they're not like that. My parents are. Hey, guys. Hey, table two is howling, how long? Five minutes! Okay, you don't have to yell at me. Oh, my God. Oh, my God, fuck. Fucking hell, he's here. Who? It's him, Arman with his whore. Which one is he? The one near the window, the blonde bitch. Oh, my God. He never took me out when Ruby was born. Now look at him, looks like a fucking gigolo. I have to go. Don't worry about him Jamila. No, I've got to go. What are doing? Omer, tell me how many snappers have we got? Six. Six? Okay, where did Jamila go? She's going home. What? The husband is here. The husband is here where? Come. Front of the window, first table. With Rebecca? Yeah. Where is Jamila? In the storeroom. Jamila love. Jamila. Jamila-moo. I'll be out in a minute, I'm changing. Okay, darling, okay, okay, thank you, sorry. Hey, what's everyone doing? Nothing. Table two is gonna string me up. Jamila-moo. Come on darling, what's wrong. I have to go, I cannot be seen here. Why? Because he'll see me. Who will see you, I don't understand. I can't dance with Arman here. Why, darling? He knows that you are a belly dancer. No, no, he doesn't. And if that bitch sees me, she'll tell her lawyer I'm a stripper and I'll lose Ruby. Rebecca. You know her. I know her. She comes here for years. You know her. I have to go. Come on darling, darling, darling, darling. What is this, this is our night. Where are you going? There is people out there waiting. The belly dancer. What is this? I cannot dance Kostas. Jesus fucking Christ, come on darling, come on. No, no. This is our night. We did it so nicely. Everybody's happy. You are so beautiful. You got the money, we talk all about this thing. I'll do it. I can do it. But I'll need some coaching. Okay by me. Bravo. Bravo, bravo. You will be great. Don't take that off because I need you on the floor, though. Hey, I can't do both. If I'm gonna dance, I need time to rehearse. Okay. Well, I have to be paid for my time, too, Kostas. Yeah, ducks, okay, then I'll keep the tips. Hey, that's not fair. The tips should be hers. Yeah, I'm the one on show out there. Oh, you do get paid, though, and you get the tips from the tables, come on. Give them to Jamila. Yeah, she's the one needs it most. What do you mean? We all agree we give them to Jamila? Yes. We all agree yes, one, two, three. Yes. Okay, to Jamilia then, to Jam, this is good. Okay. Okay, darling, okay. Where should we go? There's room in there. All right. Okay, ladies, please, please, please, please. Boy, boy, boy, you'll be great. Hey, Kostas? What? This Rebecca, she has money, no? She has money, yes. Has got millions. Her parents have got millions. They all own half of Toorak, why? And she comes here to eat? Why not Ray? Get fuck Ray. Ray got to get fucked. This is the best place here. Crazy hey, how they turned up? Hard thing is actually seeing them together. Like a couple. My Arman with her. It just doesn't make sense. Hey, uh, personal one, but, have you had other boyfriends? No. Just Arman. He was my first. Was it a wedding night job? Yeah. We had to, they came to look at the sheets. Really? That's fucked up. Shit, sorry. No, no, it's okay. I know this whole thing must seem so stupid to you. No, no, no, no. Oh, my God, I'm so sorry. That was really disrespectful. Please forgive me. It's okay. I did it for him. You know what? I think you should go crazy for a while. Yeah. You are way overdue. Come on. Have some fun Jamila. Try anything and everything. Fulfill some fantasies. I don't think I have any. You must. Arman. He wanted to have a threesome with another girl. I thought about that. Yeah, been there, done that. Mostly though, you end up shagging the girl because most guys, they can't handle two women. That's not so bad, is it? Yeah. Yeah, I always thought that, too. Where's the American chick? Oh, she'll be back with a surprise. When is the belly dancer coming? Soon. Where do you come from Arman? Armenia. Armenia, bravo. We met in an Uber. Yeah, he picked me up after the Logie Awards. Yeah, you drive this Uber? Yeah, but I'm finishing off my engineering degree. Bravo, bravo. We're getting married. What? We're getting married. You're getting married? Yeah. Congratulations bravo. What are you talking, congratulations darling. Bravo, bravo Arman. This is beautiful. Third time lucky Kostas. Of course. You know what darling. You can get married as many times as you like, as long as I get to meet them all. Arman, right? Yes, and they all have to love Greek food. Greek food, of course, that's good about it is. This one's the most handsome, don't you think? Arman? Yes. How's your father? Well, he's retired. But you know what he's like. He's still taking on cases. Okay, Jules, that Jules, you know Jules? Yeah. Best lawyer in Australia. You gotta be careful Arman. Yeah, I know, I've seen him in action. You've seen him in action. This is very good. Of course. Kostas. The phone. The phone? It's Angelo. Ah, Angelo, my son. Okay. Eh, have fun. I'll be back soon. We're gonna dance and we're gonna have a great night, all right. Okay, okay, see you, okay, bye. To the Goldmans. To the Goldmans. Yes. We always get what we want in the end. Omer, Samir, leave these. Go out and give a hand to Katerina on the floor. Okay. You all right? You know, you try all your life the best for your children, the best. Right. So they don't have a problem. Taverna here, two houses, you know. And then you son turns out to be a drug addict. At least you still have him. Bernard is 63 today. My children would be grown up with our own families. I don't know why that cunt took them, but you should love every minute you have with your son. Drug addict or not drug addict. Who gives fuck? To Bernard. Happy birthday Bernard. What the fuck are you two doing? I'm getting raped out there. What is it? Up there. Oh, it's horrible. We've got the mother fucker. I can't come out here and smoke anymore. Oh. I promise, I'll pay you back when I get a job. Actually I just I ran out of credit and the job interviews I went for, they got my mobile number, so. Here. Angelo. Why don't you come and work here for a while at Taverna? You make some money and then you learn how to run it. Listen, I'm an architect, Papa. Hmm? I mean why the fuck did I go to university all those years? Just to run the Taverna. You pushed me to go. Yeah, but what I'm saying is for when you don't have a job, then the Taverna is going to make up for your life. I can get a job easy Papa. The point is I'm just trying to find a good company to work for, not like the last bunch of malakas, they had no clue wat they were doing. If you're worried about the money, just take it back. No, I don't want it. We'll just simply talk, all right? Where you go tonight? Just some drinks with some friends. Okay. Have you eaten? You want me to make you something to eat, souvlaki or something? No, I've already eaten. I gotta go anyway. All right. Thanks. Okay. Yeah, I love you. Kostas. Where's the belly dancer tonight? The belly dancer. Of course. She will be here soon, don't worry about it, okay. And in case it's me, you have me, okay. I'll do it, yeah. Okay, welcome. Rebecca, everything all right. Aw, Kostas, the food was just beautiful. Bravo. Arman's looking forward to the belly dancer, of course. Ah, yeah, very much. You are going to dance, no? Yeah, if she's hot. Don't be a dick. He can be just a little bit of a showoff. I'll tell you what, I'll tell you. I used to do this job. I used to work with a cruise ship and I was dancing, all the widows around, you know, they would sing, they were this and that. It was great fun. What, like a gigolo? Don't be scared. What gigolo? They were 100, 200 and 300 years old. No, no, I used to take them out, go to dinner with them, dance. When they were getting tired, I used to take them back, put them to sleep and that's it. Beautiful. Okay. Can I bring you something else? Oh, God, no. Actually maybe just another wine. Beautiful, I bring. Enjoy. Okay. - Thank you. - Thank you. You need to stop giving him money. Stop being a malaka. He needs to grow up and become responsible. He's young. I lived with him for two years. The only reason why I kicked him out was to get him off drugs. And it's fucked. I thought he might love me enough to go clean. But he doesn't love anyone. Or anything. Except ice. Kostas, you and Helen need to face facts. You're enabling his addiction. Excuse me. Does anyone know when the belly dancing's starting? No, sorry, I don't. Uh. She will be here soon, love. My husband's getting tired. Yes, sorry. She will be here soon, all right, okay. Who is it? It's me darling. I'm not ready yet. How long? I don't know Kostas. Okay, five minutes? Ooh, ooh. You look beautiful. Really? Boys. Come here, come here. Doesn't she look sexy. You look hot. You are number one. Thanks guys. That's it. We go out there, everybody's waiting for you. No, I'm not ready yet. But you are ready. No, I mean the dancing. The dancing, come on now, the dancing, you just zoon, zoon, zoon, zoon, juggle a little bit, that's it, nobody will know. But I will Kostas. Would you serve crap food in your restaurant, hmm? I don't think so. I have devoted my life to telling stories and entertaining people. I am an actress. This is what I was born to do. Like you in your kitchen, yeah? Apparently. You are just going to go out there and dance. You're not making the "Titanic." I don't care. I want everything I do to be the best it possibly can be. But you're just worried about getting me out there so that people buy more alcohol. No. My work means more to me than money Kostas. Excuse me. Hi. Hi. Hello. Do you have a booking? No. Do we need one? Yes, we're very busy. Well, well have this table then. Okay, but you'll have to be quick 'cause the kitchen's about to close. Ah, have we missed the belly dancer? No. Do you boys want tap or sparkling water? Tell you what, love. Bring us a couple of beers, eh, go on. Sure. I've never cheated on anyone. So, like how does it work Mr. Ladies Man? What do you mean? Well, for instance, while you were fucking me and going home to wifey, how'd it work? Why are you drinking so much? Mm-mm, no, come on. Answer me, I'm interested in this. Look at your scared little eyes staring at me. Can I tell her the truth. I just wanna know what to look for when it happens to me. It won't. How do I know that? Because I was never really in love with her. But you must have been at some stage, 'cause you fucking married her and had Ruby. Yeah, well, I thought I was. Well, you think you're in love with me, so what's the difference? After the first time I met you, I couldn't stop thinking about you. Now that we're together, I still can't stop thinking bout you. That never happened with Jamila. After the first time I fucked her, I never thought about her again. I'm just not in my body. You'll be fine. I can't go out there. Trust me. You'll be great. I can't believe I agreed to do this. Don't be silly. You don't understand what it's like to die on stage. Look, like you said to Kostas, you're an actress. So think of this more like acting. Belly dancing is an expressive art form, so just feel the music and let the moves come. Like improvisation? Yeah. I'm scared shitless of improv, I never know what to say next. If I can come up with an objective, then let the music take over my body, I think that can work. There you go. Okay, totally, so what should be my objective? How about to make Arman's whore jealous. Oh, my God. That's it. Okay. Brilliant. Okay, cool, thank you so much. Okay, I'll let Kostas know. Okay. Hey, Frank, you won't believe what I'm about- Oh, I can bring you home a souv. Didn't you have pizza the other night? Oh, no, no, I was just reminding you. Okay. Yeah, I'll order it now on my phone. This is utterly humiliating for me Omer. Don't worry about it Jamila. I don't have a friend in the world right now. I'm your friend. Thank God. Can I ask you something and can you promise to tell me the truth? Okay. Did you see his whore? Yeah. Do you think she's hotter than me? No. No way. Really? Yeah. Okay. You know, I haven't spoken to Arman since he left the house. Just through text messages or through the lawyer. If I could just talk to him alone, I'm convinced I could make him stop all this and just come home. Is that what you want? Yeah. More than anything. She is the type of woman that gets everything she wants. Yeah, and Arman is so stupid. You know I, I think about choking her. I know I shouldn't, but, I hate her so much. They said I was a danger to Ruby at the hearing, but I would hurt Ruby. I had depression after she was born, but it was Arman's mother coming around all the time. She made me feel worse. I've got two assholes inside that just won't order their food. And I've told them the kitchen's closing. They think they just fucking own the place. Ladies and gentlemen. Excuse me, thank you. Welcome again. I am very happy to tell you that she's finally here. Yes, yes. I know, I know, you've been waiting for her, but you'll see she's deserves it. She's all the way from Los Angeles, California. The beautiful, the belly dancer Diana. Here! Yes! Up, that's it. This fucking malaka. Can this muffin another beer? I swear to God I'm gonna choke him. That's the waitress. It is, man. She's hot. I love that American chick. Fuck. Sorry, lady. You fucking scared me asshole. - Me? - Yeah. Sorry. What do you want? Don't go back in there. What? Go home. I think you should go home is more appropriate. You know what lady? I think about that every fucking day. Oh, fuck off. Oh! Mm! Mm! You all right darling? Oh, yeah. Yes, okay, are you hurt? No, I just bruised my knee a little bit. Okay, you are beautiful. I'll bring you some ice for it, all right. Thank you. - Okay darling. - Thank you. Sorry about the drama tonight folks. It's fine. It was worth waiting for. It was fantastic, more than we expected. There you go guys. Here's your receipt, thank you very much. Okay. Where were you? I had some work. There was a big fight. What? Yeah. Where were you? It was like Ling Cafe in here? I was checking the possum. Couldn't you hear the yelling? I had bad hearing. What happened to you? The old guy with the glasses tried to rape me. What? He didn't try and rape you, he touched your ass. The guy's a fucking creep. There was penetration, okay. I didn't ask for it, I was just out there trying to do my job. Aw, come off it. What? You were practically gyrating Jamila's ex just before it. No, no, that was part of the act. Katerina, his finger went up there. She gets excited, you know, but she's a very good kid. Sorry about the trouble boys. Okay? Whatever you have taken it's on Kostas and you come in again, you see Zabella, the belly dancer. Hang about? We haven't eaten anything. You've ordered. How the fuck can I order when your belly dancer kin hits me? I'll be back. Are you sure you're okay. It was bullshit, yeah, so what. Is she American bro? Who? The belly dancer. Actually I think she's Kiwi. Have a good night. Hey, belly dancer's coming over. Yeah, just let me talk to her alone. Oh boys. Hey, watch out for the belly dancer, yeah. She's got a vicious right hook. Hey. My hero. Thank you so much. That's okay. What you did for me, I mean you probably don't realize this, but you honored me. All right, it's okay, no problem. Thank you, thank you. Kitchen is closed. You won't want to read by Trip Advisor review. He has 478 followers. Local. My kids read about these things, you know. We came here for souvlaki. Okay, and the kitchen is closed. My friends. Are you saying something about us? No, we're talking about food. Well, what about some food. The kitchen is closed. I'll close the whole place. All right, okay. We'll do something about it, okay. I'll see what I can do for you, all right? What a night tonight. You want me to throw them out? No, no, no. Any gyros left? No. Okay, catasouli? No. Calamari? What do they want? Souvlaki. I'll find something. Cats, dogs, it's doesn't matter, it's malakas. Goodnight, goodnight. Go to him. She'll see me. She won't. They have a restraining order. You don't have to worry about that. Yes, I do Omer. That lawyer told me if I breached that order again, I'm going to jail and that won't look good in court. She go in a taxi. She was very angry. Are you sure? Yeah. Hey, Jamila. Oh, my God. Amazing. Thank you so much. Oh, I got you some tips. You know, before I got attacked. Oh, thanks. I'm so glad you punched that guy out. Yeah, what a fucking pig. Yeah. Your dancing was so good, it caused a brawl. Yeah, well, did you see her leave? I did. How good was that? I know. You know she hasn't come back yet. Yeah, he's sitting out there all alone. I know. Ah, hey, I'm really sorry. Your skirt got ripped. Kostas. Uh, where are the toilets? Through there. It's locked. It's locked. It's locked. Let's see. That's funny. It is. Somebody has locked it from outside. I go, okay, open, okay. Omer of making souvlaki. Fuck, that's diversion. Here you go. Excuse me? Oh, it's like bruschettas, only Greek. See you got your tzatziki, your eggplant, your caviar. Some bread. That looks all right. You are gonna feature as the glue in my review of this place. That's nice. Okay. Okay. What happened? Did you have a fight with Rebecca? My wife and I would have a fight every day. We love each other. Look, I was just dancing with the belly dancer and then she went to the toilet. You want to go to the toilet? Yeah. Okay, go. Rebecca? Rebecca? Oh. Nobody's here. Are you sure she went to the toilet? Yeah, I think so. What, is there another way out? Yes, there is, of course, the courtyard here, where the staff goes to smoke and then there is the lane, you want me to show you? No, that's all right, I need to go. Okay, don't worry about it. My boy, don't worry about it, okay. These things happen. She's a lovely girl, but she wants to be boss like her father. If she wants to be boss, let her be boss. ♪ Rebecca ♪ Rebecca. Where are you? Have you gone home? Baby, I'm worried about you. Look, I'm sorry if I upset you, I didn't mean to. I was just, um, I was just having fun. You said you like to watch me dance, I was dancing for you. Can you please call me back when you get this message. Hey. I'm so glad that you called. You're never gonna believe what happened Frank. Oh, shit. I completely forgot. Fuck, babe, I'm so sorry. I'll do it now, I'll call you back, okay, bye. Hey, uh, Lexie Baker's is closed. Yeah, they're closed, too. I'm still at work. Well, I can bring you home a souv. Or you could get off your fat fucking ass and do it yourself. Oh, no. What? Is that what I think it is? What it is? Fuck, it's possum. Oh, shit. What are you gonna do with it? Ah, he's making souvlaki for the food critics. Can you eat it? They eat it on the "Beverly Hillbillies." What? It's a TV show malaka. Oh, look, I found some recipes here. You can't eat it Omer. Why not? Come on Samir, make me coffee. Come on, move, move. What is this? For those mother fuckers. What did you find? Don't ask. What is this? Possum. Possum? Yes. You got it. Yes. You can eat it apparently. They say it tastes like chicken. I haven't smoked for the last seven years. I want a cigarette. You want one? - Now! - Okay. All right. In this shop, for the last 25 years, we only serve the best meat. It's like rabbit Kostas. Oregano. Put garlic. Salt. Pepper. and lemon. Okay, fuck it. Leave it with me. Now. That's it. Hey, what's everyone doing? Nothing. Kostas gonna have a smoke. Really? If everything goes to shit tonight darling. Oh. Oh, my God, take a look. Yay, Jamila, go for it. Oh, fuck, this could be round two. Kosta. Are you gonna smoke that thing or fuck it? I'm sticking around for this. Don't worry Kostas, it's on my own time. Okay, okay, bravo, bravo. I don't know why you don't answer your phone, but this is ridiculous Rebecca. I love you. You know I don't have my wallet on me because you said that I look like a Pakistani with a bomb in my pocket. Please, call me back. Now you can stop telling me off. Hello. What happened? Did you find Rebecca? No, uh, she's, uh, not answering her phone, so I just thought I'd come out here, see if she's here, but, uh, yeah, she's not. No, no, here, Rebecca not here. I'll just head back inside. Finish off my drink. Good idea. I reckon he was gonna do a runner? That one? You think so? Yes. Didn't you see him? He looked very guilty. He was all nervous. Hello, Katerina, how are you? Hi, Helen, I'm well thanks. That's good love. I should be going back inside. Angelo's had an accident. He's okay Kostas, he's home now. That wasn't his fault. He didn't see it. He hit a motorbike, one of those Domino Pizza scooters. The poor thing panicked and didn't stop. It was the shock. He wasn't thinking properly. You can't see those bloody scooters at the best of times. They shouldn't be legal. He was at the Royal Melbourne. They couldn't tell me how he was. I pretended I was one of the managers at Domino's. I think he was scared because the police would come. He's had terrible luck in his life Kostas. He's worried about the police getting his number plate from the cameras and tracing it to the Taverna. What are you doing? Sit down Arman. We need to talk. What are you doing here? You know there's an intervention order. I work here. Are you going to report me? No. But if Rebecca sees you, she will. You're a coward. You couldn't even tell me to my face. And what about Ruby? Your own flesh and blood. You walk out on us as if we were shit. Look at her. See how much she's grown in just two months. You can't face the facts that you've completely fucked over me and Ruby for a dirty old slut. She's not that. Yes, she is, don't defend her. Ruby hates you. Do you know that? I had everything planned for you, but you ruined it. Sending her text messages, slashing her tires, emailing her work, harassing her, doing crazy things. She's from an important family. Okay, you run off and expect me to be nice about it. I was gonna take care of you and Ruby with money, set you up for the rest of your life so you wouldn't have to worry about finances. I don't want their money. Come home Arman. When you become an engineer, we'll have all the money we need. It's not too late. I still love you. You know you love me, too. I have Rebecca now. Did you see the text I sent you? Yeah. You can have me and that dancer, for instance, whenever you want. She told me she wants to fuck us both. When are you going to face facts? I don't love you anymore. I think you're sick. You won't get Ruby. Honestly, I'd prefer her to stay with you, but Rebecca wants her now. She won't get her. Hey, that smells amazing Omer. I put extra garlic. Do you miss Ang? Yeah. Who am I kidding. I love him. I think about him every day, even though he's a shit. Hey, sometimes you've just gotta face the facts and accept people for who they are. I saw Helen before. I think she blames me for Ang being on the ghee. No way. No, she's probably just angry at herself. How's Frank? We just had this huge fight. Oh, what happened? I forgot to order his pizza and then I yelled at him. I'm an idiot, aren't I. Seriously, I've gotta stop doing this. You know, I felt violated with that guy, I still do. But, and this is gonna sound completely inappropriate. At least he made me feel wanted and appreciated. All for the wrong reasons, I know, but at least I got some attention. I get it babe. Listen, you need to stop ordering pizzas for Frank. He gets stressed out doing stuff for himself. He's a grown man, he'll sort it out. Make him appreciate you more. I know, but here's the thing, right. For the last half an hour, all I can think about is taking home a souv. 'Cause like that's how my brain works, he makes me feel guilty and then I do things for him. Sally, seriously, I do not recommend that you take home the souv for Frank tonight. Okay, thanks Kat. Yeah, you're right. You're the best. Here you go guys, sorry about the wait. The glue. Yes. Can I get you lovebirds anything else? You? You want another drink? No. Okay, I'll just grab your bill then. Jamila. Um, can I borrow some money? I'll pay you back tomorrow. I don't have any. Doesn't she give you money? I don't know where she is right now. Be careful old man. These people are not like us. Like you. I know what I'm doing. Do you? You see that jacket on the back of your chair? Feel it. That is Vicuna wool. It's from the most expensive sheep in the world. I never even heard about ti. How much do you think that cost? Have you been drinking? Because it's not worth this. Are you sure? Are you sure? Nah. Don't drink anymore Kostas, please. Okay? I'll call Zeus Goldman if I get arrested. That's what I was waiting for, I was. Uh, bravo. Oy! Two more beers, yeah. Two more. Bar is closed. You keep closing things. Sorry, boys. No more. Go to the pub. That's not fair, mate. That's unfair? Yeah. That's not fair? And it is fair for you to sit here and drink and eat for free. That's fair? Yeah, it's fair. That review. Post it. Post it. I'm gonna close your shop down. Get the fuck out of my restaurant. Now. Out! Get the fuck out. Oy! No need to be so fucking rude. Out! Exo! Exo! Kostas, can I get paid? I have to go home because the babysitter's about to leave soon. Yes, of course, of course. Sorry about the shouting darling. Okay, did you get your tips? Yeah, Sally gave me what she earned. Okay, okay. Did you get a chance to talk to him darling? Yeah. It's definitely over between us. Okay. Time for you to fall in love again. You are young and beautiful. There are a lot of men out there for you Jamila. Yes? Here. Thanks Kostas. Here. Well. He can't pay the bill because he left his wallet at home and that slut, I mean Rebecca, she was supposed to pay, but she's still missing. Rebecca hasn't come back yet? Where did she go? Maybe I have to speak to her father. Well, he's embarrassed. Okay, go tell him the bill is done, all right. No problem. Not to worry. We're not gonna say anything to him. I already told Arman what a lovely girl he had, what a lovely girl. What does that mean? Mean a true friend tells the bitter truth. Okay. So bring it on. Your dancing is no good. Okay. Geez. You know, maybe if you had of said that to me yesterday, I'd have been crushed. But I'm an actress, not a dancer. So thank you for your honestly Omer. Okay, now it's my turn. Okay. You have to get over the death of your wife and kids. Can I take you home? It's the least I can do. This is Ismelt, this was Singue. What was that? Huh? Another one, another one. You say to the police Kostas left the restaurant and went home because Helen was sick. Don't do it Kostas. And if I go to jail, you are going to tell the customers that Kostas has gone to Greece for family business. All right? That's it. Kostas! Kostas! Rebecca? Rebecca. What happened? Babe, where were you? What the fuck is she doing here? I work here. Thank God you're okay. What the fuck is going on Arman? I was waiting for you. What happened? I got fucking kidnapped. - What? - Who darling? By him, that fucking creep. Omer? No, darling, no. Omer is the head serf. He locked me in his fucking van. I will fucking kill you. A serf Arman, he's more man than you'll ever be. Get fucked Jamila. Hey! Oh, fuck, this place is like a fucking brothel. What did you do Omer? Omer wouldn't hurt a fly. Sorry, Rebecca, I'm sorry, Rebecca. Omer, why'd you do this? Don't pick on him. Shut the fuck up bitch. You shut up slut. You breach the order again, this time you're going to jail so fuck you. Babe, I know you're upset, but please just calm down. You will never get Ruby. I don't fucking want her. Yes. It is true that I attacked this lady. Omer, are you for real? Because I want for Jamila and Arman to speak alone. But I asked you to go. And you were very rude to me. But I'm sorry, lady, okay. They had things, a husband and wife must say to each other before it ends. No messages on computer. No fucking bullshit lawyers. They have to be alone to say it. It was all love. And when it ends, it's very sad. There's a little girl in the middle. She feels sad, too. The hearts break, freeze. Life hurts us. Gods doesn't protect us. It has become broken from sadness. I could never leave my Berta now for someone else and then try to take her children away from her. No, this is not love. I don't judge you Arman and maybe if I had long enough with my wife, maybe I understand the temptation of another woman, but inside my heart, now is forever and our children by her side. My friend Sally, she says to me that I must move on. I know it is true. But. You can never grow over a broken heart. I never got the chance to say goodbye. I never got to the chance to mend my children. Give me one more. I never got a chance to say goodbye. To kiss Berta. To hold her hand. To be with her when she died. To kiss Ismet and my little boy. I never got a chance to give one last hug and kiss to my daughter. I couldn't tell her how much I love her. I love her. Hey. Kostas. I'm in breach of my working visa. Okay, go home, leave tomorrow. I'll see you tomorrow. Hello, officers. Please come in. - Good evening, sir. - Hello. We're looking for a Kostas Cyriaki, is that you? Yes. Constable Farley, Constable Louie, we're from the Miraben Police Station around the corner. Just need to have a chat to you. What happened? You folks all right? Yeah, yeah, we're just leaving. Thank you Kostas for an interesting night. Rebecca, next time we dance, yes. Yeah. Okay, thank you so much, okay, good night. Good night. Thank you Kostas. Okay. Yes, Arman. Sir, do you ride in a white vehicle, it's a BMW 2014 model with the registration LG zed 611? Is that your car? Yes. Would you like something to drink. A glass of water or something. Water would be good. Water? Katerina. Water please. Mr. Cyriaki? Oh, you can call me Kostas. Kostas. Under Section 60 of the Road Safety Act, you're required to give us information as to who was driving that vehicle tonight. It's been involved in an incident down on South Road.
