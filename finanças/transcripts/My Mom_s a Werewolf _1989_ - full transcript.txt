Jennifer? Can I borrow $175? - No. - But, Jennifer, it's a number 12. A number 12, Jennifer, do you realize how rare that is? - No. (Stacey sighs) - Wow, look at this!

(babbling) - [Celia] And now an update on the recent series of ferocious dog attacks. A young woman was assaulted and bitten by what she claims was a cross between a Rottweiler and local Councilman Lou Lamont. Lamont was not available for questioning. The woman is under psychiatric observation, claiming Mr. Lamont is really a werewolf. - Hi, hon. - Oh hi, sweetheart. - [Announcer] New lease on life thanks to surgery at the hospital. - Sorry I'm late for dinner. - [Leslie] It's okay, I saved you some. - Huh? - It's the recipe I told you about on the phone today. It's really good for you, seaweed spinach quiche with cultured yak butter. It's delicious. - Oh. - [Announcer] 72 hours to see if there's any sign of organ rejection. - Looks good. (paper bag rustling) - Had to work late again, huh? - Yeah, you know, we're gearing up for the annual pre-Christmas sale. - [Announcer] For the time being. - Hm, I feel like I never see you anymore, honey. Why don't we do something this weekend? - Like what? - I don't know. Take a trip, go to the park. Something. - May have uncovered. - Howard, I feel like we're losing the excitement in our lives, you know what I mean? - [Announcer] They are now isolating bacteria and may be able to come up with-- Howard? (Howard snores) Oh. - [Announcer] Advertisers are often saying there's a problem of catching the intentional prospective customers. Well, take the case of two men. (men shouting) - I bet that you didn't know that Lon Chaney Junior was the only actor to play all the monsters, Frankenstein, Dracula, the Wolfman and the Mummy. (giggles) Oh, guess how many times Bela Lugosi played Dracula? - Who cares? (men laughing) - Come on, knock it off and watch the game, will ya? - Howard, Howard! - Oh thanks, honey. - Thanks, honey? Thanks, honey? - Yeah, come on! (men shouting) - I'm gonna rip that man's throat out. - [Man] Hey, what do you call a girl who starts dating to the level of her intelligence? A widow! (men laughing) - Come on, knock it off! - Mom! Don't forget the flea collar! (engine revving) - What's wrong with your mom? - It's Dad, he has time for everything but her. - Maybe she bores your father. I read in "Cosmopolitan" that 50% of all divorces happen because of neglect. Or maybe it was adultery. - Don't they kind of go hand-in-hand? - Oh, whatever, and whatever. (laughs) You know, I think you worry too much. - I just don't want to be the product of a broken home. - Geez, I would love it. (sighs) I could use my dad's closet to store my body parts collection in. - Your parents are hardly ever home anyway. - You're gonna be the life of the party tomorrow. - Want to help me do a good deed? - No. (men cheering) (soft music) ♪ Down and lonely, baby - Jerk. ♪ Things begin to go - Pigs.

(Leslie chuckles) A bottle of Mouton Rothschild '66 for the lady and myself. Oh, I'll pay. - Well, if you insist. - And two orders of steak tartare. - No, I'm a vegetarian. - Pity. - I'll have the pasta salad and the crepes Suzette for dessert, please. Do you want? - No no, no no, I dislike silver, it spoils the taste. I want to relish the substances I put between my teeth. - So what makes you think she'll be there? - It's lunchtime. She always eats there when she shops on weekends. - What makes you think she'll believe that your dad got her the flowers? - Because she'll want to believe it. - Boy, women sure get dumb when they get married. Geez, look at this. Another woman was attacked by a wild animal last night. - [Jennifer] How horrible. - Talk about close to home, it was right on your street. Police think it was some sort of coyote or wild dog. Want to know what I think? - No. (romantic string orchestral music) Oh my god, it's too late. Come on. - I mean, I really shouldn't complain because it's not the worst, you know? (water splashing) - Hey, hey! - Don't be silly, he's probably just an old friend. - I know all her friends. - So it's a new friend. - But you know what really gets my goat? It's the weekend, and does he want to spend time with me? Nah, he invites his drinking buddies over to watch the game. I swear, sometimes I could just tear that man apart. (romantic string orchestral music) - Look at that, he's kissing her hand. I've never even seen my dad hold it. - We gotta get closer. (kisses smacking) - Sorry, I didn't mean to go on about my troubles. - Oh no, no no no no. Don't ever apologize about your true feelings. - Can you believe that? That disgusting pervert is licking my mother's hand. - It's kinda cute, maybe he's a foreigner. - Oh. - If I were married to someone as wonderful and as sensitive as you, I wouldn't want to spend a minute without you. - Oh, Mr. Thropen. - Harry. - Harry. - You radiate love. And compassion. I just want to crawl up inside of you and die. - There's a pleasant thought. - How about a toast? - Yeah. - To eternal happiness and togetherness with people who appreciate their own kind. (glasses clink) - I'll drink to that. I don't understand it, but I'll drink to it. You know, oh! I'm a, I'm a, a married woman. - I can respect that. - Maybe you should hold off giving her the flowers. (Leslie moaning) (plate sizzling) (Harry growling) - What, what's the matter?

It's make-believe, Jennifer. - How do you stop a werewolf? - You shoot it with a silver bullet. - She's my mom, I don't want to kill her. - [Stacey] What do you want to do, paper-train her? - Thanks for your help. - Ralphie? (dial tone humming) Wait, wait, Ralph! Ralph! Shit! - Good evening, my love. - You, you're, you're the man of my dreams. - That's so flattering. - Who are you, what's going on? - I have come to set you free. You are becoming immortal. - What the hell's happening to me? - Oh no, don't be afraid. I can show you how to survive as a werewolf. - A what wolf? - Werewolf. And I need a werewife. Someone to keep my race alive. I need sons and daughters. And you, my love, are the one who's going to give them to me. - (laughs) I suppose we're gonna live in a were-house. - At first I just wanted to devour you, like the others. But then I saw you had a quality, an honesty that I wanted to preserve. Forever. - Forever? Forever, forever? - I know this is a tremendous shock to your system, but soon, very soon, you'll grow to accept it. - Hi, honey. I'm home. - Oh my god, it's my husband. (Harry growls) - Tomorrow night, I'll be back for you and you'll be mine. - Leslie. - Howard. - He won't accept you, humans never do. (comical music) (Howard sniffs) Forget all that has happened. I will be back for you tomorrow night. - Honey, are you ready for me yet? Honey? - Oh! (sultry jazz music) (suspenseful music) (wind whistling) (Harry howling) - God, god, gee! (shattered glass tinkling) Ow! - Honey? - Oh. - What, ow, I thought I heard voices. - That was the television. (shattered glass tinkling) - Television? What's wrong with the lights? - Power failure. (shattered glass tinkling) - Oh. Oh! Oh, who needs lights anyway? - Honey, not tonight, I have a headache. - Come on, Leslie, you don't have to pretend with me. Listen, darling, I know that before last night you were very upset with me because I haven't been paying you a lot of attention. - No, I wasn't, you've been wonderful, now go to sleep. - Oh Leslie, I'm crazy about you. - Oh please. (howls) (both howling) - You've turned me into an animal, I love it. - Don't even say that! - Leslie, why the hell are you all wrapped up in this stuff? It's so warm in here. - I've got a chill. - Well, I can take care of that. - Good idea, go fix the heater. - I got my own built-in heater. - Oh, oh! - Oh no, Marbo. Marbo, you know you're not allowed on the bed. Oh, Marbo, Marbo. (Marbo barks) Come on, get off, get off the bed. Oh stay, stay. (Howard sighs) Good night. - Good night, honey. (Leslie sputters) - [Madame] I see you in conflict with an animal. - [Jennifer Voiceover] That's not a costume, is it, Mom? - [Stacey] It's make-believe, Jennifer. - [Madame] I see the sign of the pentagram on your face. - [Leslie] No, it's the wolfman, who do you think it is? - My mom's a werewolf. - Get out of here! Get out of here! - [Madame] Take my card, you'll be needing it. (soft acoustic guitar music) (knocking) (somber violin music) (knocking) - Go away. - Please. This is Jennifer Shaber, I need your help. My mom's a werewolf. - Call the zoo. - What should I do, she's my mother. - Kill her. Oh no, Jennifer, wait, come in. I'll tell you everything I know about werewolves. - Okay. (sweet violin music) (birds chirping) (Howard inhales) - Ow! (Howard humming) Good morning, darling. (laughs) You look like hell. - God, you wouldn't believe the weird dreams I've been having, I'm exhausted. - Why don't you just stay in bed? I'll be home before you know it. (smacking) - Can't get enough of me now, can you? - Enough, Leslie, one night you whet my appetite, the next you leave me hanging high and dry. You know how to drive a guy crazy, agh, whoo! Leslie, you got me howling at the moon. I don't know what's happened to you, darling, but you've turned me into a new man. (Howard humming) - Let's see. - Hey, kids. (dramatic music) - Mom, you're human. - Yeah. - Mom, we'll cure you, it won't be easy, but I think together we can beat this thing. - What on earth are you talking about? Stacey, what's wrong with my daughter? - She's freaked, Mrs. Shaber, but it's okay. She hasn't gotten violent yet. - No, Mom, stay here. - I'm late for my hair appointment. - You can change back at any time. Believe me, it's better to change at home than out there. - Jennifer. - Mom, I can't let you leave. - You can't let me leave? Who's the mother around here anyway? You are weird. You have got to find yourself a boyfriend, both of you. - She thinks I'm crazy. - She may have a point. She looks pretty human to me, Jennifer. - Of course she does, she changed back just like the gypsy said she would, come on. (birds chirping) (patrons chatting) - Same thing, we're having a special today, six for $5. Six for $5, that'll last you for years. You got a lot of hair, sweetheart. Absolutely, get that money out, thank you so much. Okay. - Hi, Peggy. - Your nightmare caught up with you, girl.

"Fangorama," Issue number 45, July 1986. You've got to find the werewolf who infected her. Look, maybe we should just call a vet. Holy cow! (mystical music) - Jen, do something. (crunching) Ew! Yuck. Try the holy water. (Harry sniffs) What about the cross? Oh my goodness. Isn't that? - That's Dennis. He's a friend. - A friend? When did you get to meet him? - Last night. - Holy cow, "Mesmerizing of the Fuzz Creatures." Werewolves have the power of hypnotizing people into believing that they're friends. He is the guy that did it to her. - Nah, he's just a friend. - No, he's the one that has to die. Look, shoot him with a silver bullet and your mom is cured. - Mom? Mom? Let's go. - My dear Leslie, I've come for you. - [Stacey] What are you looking for? - We've got to protect ourselves. - We've got these! - Great, we'll paper cut him to death. (growls) Make sure he doesn't bite you. Look at this. (whining) - You'll soon forget about your old lifestyle as a human. - I hope the tip is silver. - It's steel, my dad's cheap. - Our werechildren will be beautiful, Leslie. (Leslie growling) - Hurry up, you've gotta destroy him before the moon sets. Time is running out. (Harry growling) (gorilla roaring) (woman screaming) (heroic music) (Harry growling) - Damn those Shabers. A little less noise down there! Oh, shoe. Ooh, that's (mumbles), get that shoe. I wanna smell that shoe, please get that shoe. - Hi. - Hi, Dad. - What's all the noise, where's your mother? (Harry growling) - She's upstairs. But I don't think you should see her right now. - Why, what's going on, that's a nice outfit. - She's got someone upstairs with her and he's not human. (Harry growling) - This could get kinda hairy. - You're telling me. - Holy cow. (shattered glass tinkling) - Oh, oh, oh, oh. You wouldn't believe what those perverts are doing now. - Leslie, open the door or I'll break it in. (shattered glass tinkling) Ooh! Good door. (heroic music) - Jennifer. - Stacey. - They're dressed in gorilla suits and they're rolling around the room, having an orgy, ha! (pitcher clangs) That does it, I'm calling the cops. - All right, Leslie, what is all this about? (Harry growling) Excuse me. - Did you see 'em? (shattered glass tinkling) - I have to go to the bathroom. (siren wailing) - 42-14. - I've gotta go in there. No, I have to go in and destroy that guy before the moon goes down, which will be real soon. - Jennifer, you could get killed. - She's my mom, if I don't do this she's doomed. - Between your driving and your chili bean lunches, you're gonna kill me. - Don't start, Charlie. - You made me drop my doughnut. - You and your doughnuts! - It was the last chocolate and it landed chocolate-side down. - Police work here, excuse me. - If you had to pay for the doughnuts-- - All right, fine, I'll buy the doughnuts and you drive. Okay? - All right, okay. I thought Halloween was last night. - Yeah, these folks are usually so quiet. - About time you guys got here. This is not the behavior of good, decent, church-going Christians. - You the one who called? - Who the hell else would I be? - [Jennifer] Mom? - [Stacey] Do you see 'em? - [Jennifer] He's got my mom. - [Stacey] Jen, be careful. (Harry growling) (Leslie moaning) - What's going on? - Get away from her! (Leslie screams) You're dead now, you son of a bitch. I hope this works. (Jennifer screams) (Harry roars) I did it, I did it, I did it, aagh! Gotta get out of here! - Jennifer, are you okay? (Jennifer screams) - I stabbed the creep, I can't get out. - You stay here, sir. - Why can't I go in? - Because I said so. (Jennifer screaming) - Hurry up! - Come on! - All right, all right, what's the noise? What's the racket up here, what's going on? - There are two animals in my bedroom, tearing it apart. - Is he dead yet? - Is who dead yet? - [Jennifer] No, he's rolling around on the floor. - The police are here. - Mom? Where are you? - They're coming in. - Mom? (Jennifer screams) (Harry growling) Mom's not changing back. - Shit! - What is it? - Mrs. Shaber won't change back until he dies. And if he doesn't die before the moon sets, she's in deep shit. - Let me smell your breath. - Only if I can smell yours. (Harry growling) (mystical music) - Jennifer, clear the door. - Help me, hurry, please! Help! - We're coming in to help. - Can you see her? - Don't shoot, she's my mom. - That's my wife. - That animal is your wife? - Well, you have to get to know her. - Mom, Mom, it's me, Jennifer. Please don't hurt me. - [Stacey] Is there any blood in there? - I'm your daughter, remember? (Harry wheezes) (Leslie whimpers) - [Stacey] Would you look at that thing? Holy cow! - It's working. (mystical music) (Jennifer gasps) - What happened to this room? - She's delirious. - Why is there a dead animal on the floor? Why are the police here? What's the volume of the Caspian Sea? - 88 billion cubic meters. - You don't remember anything? - I remember. Going to the beauty shop and falling asleep. And I remember Jennifer acting very strange. - Now that this is over, would someone please explain to me what's going on? - Me too. - Me too. - [Stacey] Go on, Jennifer. - I'll tell you everything. - Let's tell the world! (police radio chatter) (upbeat music) - This is Celia Celica, KSFB TV News, reporting live from the scene of one of the most bizarre and macabre stories in human history. Police were summoned by a neighbor who'd complained about a commotion coming from the residence-- - Hey hey hey! - Of Howard and Leslie Shaber. - It's me, Malcolm MacAfee. - Whoa, whoa. - I'm the neighbor, I live right over there. Oh! (crowd laughs) Ooh! (laughs) - When police arrived on the scene, they discovered more than they had bargained for. - What did you discover? - More than we bargained for. - Oh. - [Celia] But authorities are still in question about the identity of the homicide victim. - Yeah, this is great. (laughs) (growls) I love it. (growls) Woof, woof, woof. (laughs) You should see it, big dad. Hey, when you're finished with him, can I have him? I want to make a rug. (chuckles) (crowd screams) (Malcolm laughing) (Malcolm grunting) - And nothing will ever be the same in the lives of the Shaber family. - Stacey poobah. Stacey poobah! I'm the one who saved her! - Jennifer, would you still have accepted your mother if you couldn't have changed her back? I understand. (siren wailing) You're too emotional to talk right now. Here is the alleged she-wolf. Or is it her-wolf? - Thanks. - And here is the man married to the poor tormented Mrs. Shaber, father of the terrified and distressed Jennifer Shaber. Tell me, Mr. Shaber, do you feel that this whole incident has bonded you closer to your wife or pulled you further apart? - Well, I-- - As you can see, the whole family is mortified and speechless. - All right, this whole lawn is under arrest. - Move it back! move it back, everybody. - Do not force me to draw my weapon. - How the hell do they expect me to do an interview when no one has anything to say? - I predicted this, yes! And Madame Gypsie will tell all. Tomorrow, I read for kings and presidents! Tonight, I read for you. Yes, special today! $35 today, the special. Yes, yes yes yes, ladies and gentlemen, come come. I am getting the feeling, I am getting the feeling! That tomorrow you will all go on a long cruise with tall dark strangers. (crowd shouting at once) (peaceful orchestral music) - Honey, I know I've been a real schmuck in the past. - Sometimes. - And a jerk. - Yup. - And a-- - Asshole? - Jennifer, go to your room. And an asshole. What I'm trying to say is. - No more football on weekends? - No more football. Except for maybe the Super Bowl, of course. (smacks) And maybe (smacks) the Orange Bowl. Maybe. (smacks) And then if you're busy. (smacks) (phone rings) - Hello? - [Stacey] Jennifer, we got a big problem. - What is it? - "Fangoria," Issue number 43, October 1978. Unless a formal exorcism (Jennifer sighs) is performed on the deceased werewolf, the one who killed it will transform within 24 hours of the slaying. - Good night, Stacey. - No, Jennifer, Jennifer!
