Do you want move in with me? Do you want move in with me? I want to sleep. I've been thinking, with this new job I can move out of my parent's house. And I wanted you to move in with me. Are you proposing marriage? Yeah, something like that. Something like that? I do! - What? - I accept. But the air conditioner has to be on during the night. And the hallway lights also. Okay. What time is it? Come on... what time it is? 5:30 PM - My dad's coming home. - 13 missed calls! Shut! You better get dressed. - 13 missed calls from whom? - From home, where else? I can't wait to move out! Oh, I bought the plane tickets. What plane tickets? For our anniversary trip! Well, now it's gonna be our honeymoon trip. Why don't you call your dad? No. I'm on my way home. I don't feel like arguing on the phone. Did you really accept? Yeah, I did. Lucas? Lucas! What's the matter? It's mom and dad... (YOU, ME AND HIM) Can I sleep in your bed? Sure. Come here. Take your shoes off, Lucas. - I don't want to. - But my bed will get dirty. But I want to sleep with my shoes on. Just for tonight. Please! Ok. Good night. Good night. Danilo, I never want to go to the cemetery again. Could you make me some milk? - Sure, how do you like it? - With chocolate. It's cold. I'll heat it. Now it's too hot. For how many seconds should we heat it in the microwave? I don't know. I'll pour some cold milk, then. Danilo, When do I have to go back to school? School... you're right! What grade are you in? Fourth. Already in fourth grade? You're all grown up! Not even in the little league anymore! I don't know when you have to go back. If you want, I'll drive you to school on Monday. What time does it start? At 7. Wow! That early? It's better to be 15 minutes early, than 1 hour late. Dad used to say that. Danilo, I'm sad. Me too. - Bye - Bye Lucas, put them on the shelf, please. - Hi - Hi Page 17. But it's not very good. Plus, it's smaller than I wanted. Oh, it's great. I really like this photo you made. What's the matter? I'm worried. - About what? - About Lucas. Didn't your uncle say Lucas could live with them? I'm not sending Lucas to another city. Not even for a while? Would you send you sister to another city? Besides, Lucas is complaining about being home alone all the time. You know it's not true. Of course it is. I always come home late. So I guess we won't catch a movie tonight? I can't. Okay. I have to go back to the office. I really loved your photos. Marcos, Why don't you come over for dinner tonight? Hey man, what are you playing? A game. What's the name of this game? Tomb Raider, you don't know it. Of course I know it, I have one of these at home. Yeah, right! Danilo, what time is it? 10:30. 10:30?? We have to go to bed. I have school tomorrow. Besides, Marcos' dad must be worried. My dad is out of town. Marcos will sleep over tonight. But there's no place for him. Oh, sure, there is. He'll sleep in my bed, and I'll sleep with you. Let's go. No, Lucas. You'll sleep in your own bed tonight. But I'll take my shoes off, if you want. No, Lucas. Go on and brush your teeth. No, Marcos. What's the matter? Lucas will hear us. You must be kidding? Lucas! Where's Danilo? He's too busy at work and asked me to pick you up. Come on. Come on. Danilo told me you have a girlfriend, is it true? No. You don't? Now she's Marcelinho's girlfriend. But only because he has a kart and had his birthday party in an amusement park. But a girl from my class, Maira, she said that Luiza likes me. But I don't like her, 'cause she has already been Andre's girlfriend, and I don't like him. Well, soon you'll find the right girl for you, I'm sure. You're my brother's boyfriend, aren't you? Yeah, I am. My dad didn't like you. Did you know? Yeah, I did. He was always arguing with my mom because of you. It's normal that some people do not like other people. You don't like Andre, for example. But he used to like you, and said you were part of the family. But then he changed his mind. It's always hard to get used to things when they change. But in the end... Who knows? I still like you! Danilo, I'm having trouble sleeping. - Can I sleep in your bed? - Sure, come on! Yeah! I'm in the middle! Marcos! Why are you leaving so early? Today I have to arrive early at work. - Bye. - Bye. The tickets are here, Danilo. Yeah, it's our honeymoon. All right. You said you weren't coming. I lied I was sick, at work. Dummie. Come on... - Did you get the ticket? - I did. - What about the passport? - Got it. Whenever you get too busy... don't send just anyone to pick up Lucas at school. He asked about you yesterday. I guess he misses you. Tell him I sent a kiss. I really wanted to go with you. It's okay. So... bye. Bye. Hi. Hi. Are you okay? No. Can I sleep in your bed? Sure, come here. What happened? You look sad. Yeah. Grown up stuff. You said I was a grown up already! That I wasn't in the little league anymore. This is another kind of grown up. Things change when you're this kind of grown up. A friend of mine said that it's hard to get used to things when they change, but in the end... who knows? This friend of yours is smart. Let's sleep? Sure. - Good night. - Good night. And if you want, you can keep your shoes on. Ok. Put a bit more on this glass. How many seconds do I leave the first one? 15 seconds! - 15? - Yeah. - So, did you take that quiz? - Yeah. - What was the subject? - Science. - Did you nail it? - Yeah. Oh look. There's a popcorn button in this microwave. I'll buy some popcorn for us to try it. - Did you really nail the quiz? - Yeah, I did. - So, is it good? - No, it's cold. Let's put the second one. How many seconds? 20 seconds. Oh, I got to the end of that level on Tomb Raider. - You did? - Yeah. I'll teach you how to do it. Tradu??o: Daniel Ribeiro Revis?o: M?rcia Macedo And now? It's good? Yes. Let's eat?
