Geez, how late is Fotomat open? I do wanna thank you all for your patience. We are now obviously ready to go. I'm Howard Stringer, and as president of CBS Entertainment, it is my singular pleasure, and a great moment for us, to be able to bring this great star to CBS, David Letterman! I never dated Amy Fisher! I fixed her car, I helped her with her homework, and, that's all, alright, thank you. Alright, I'll take some questions, and, then, Colin Powell will be in here, and update you on the bombing. I do wanna thank CBS for their support, and, of course, for their generosity, I mean, wow, this is a deal that would put a smile on Jack Benny's face, and that's in the condition he's in right now! Does G.E. make the best managers for a television network? What was the question? Oh, yeah, no, you know, I don't know about that, but, they make a darn fine toaster oven. C'mon, Paul, we gotta do a show. Dave, I have a terrible case of the hiccups. You tried holding your breath? Everything. I got an idea, hold on. What are you doing? Just put that on your head there, breathe normally, there, Paul. Okay. I'm breathin'. How was that, you feel any better? Oh, gosh. Sorry... Must've been something I ate. It's bloody marvelous. The Tonight Show, Johnny's guest host tonight is, Jay Leno! Ladies and gentlemen, Jay-y-y Leno! Thank you! Thank you! Wonderful, wonderful, that's nice to hear, Now, did you all see in the paper, there's a survey that says that you're safer, and, now this is true, you're safer, on an airplane than you are in your own bathroom. Do you believe that? Do you think that's true? I don't know, I've never slipped on the toilet seat and fallen 35,000 feet! I mean, I never adjusted the shower rod, and had a fire ball come out and incinerate me. So, why can't we just throw money at one of them? What sort of offer do you have in mind? What does it matter? "Late Night's" making $70 million a year for NBC. Where's our bloody piece? That would have been Mr. Sajak. Oh, Christ, what a disaster. He's got a lock on every blue-haired old biddy who ever watched "Wheel of Fortune." Do you know how many of our stations are canceling him for Arsenio? It's like they're canceling him before we can. Look at these fucking numbers when Leno fills in for Carson. And Letterman. NBC has him signed through '93. Well, what about Leno? NBC only has a one-year holding deal with Jay. That's nothing. He could be ripe. So let's steal him! We can give him a show now, for christsakes. I'll push Sajak over a cliff if we can get Leno. They might fight for him. Let them. They can't fight equally for Leno and Letterman. They're not gonna offer both Carson's spot when he retires. This is the best opportunity we've ever had to break NBC's strangle-hold on late night. Okay, Howard. Let's go stir something up. And, you know, we can knock it out in one fell swoop. Oh! Oh, bouncy up here! We gotta do a commercial here, boys and girls. We'll be right back with more Sandra Bernhard. I'm havin' a blast. Thanks for havin' me back on Dave. How you doin'? What do you want the number of my therapist? You should be thrilled with your life. It wasn't that bad, Dave. Okay, we had a little trouble with the first bit, but Sandra was good, and you were good with her. I sucked, Morty, and the whole show sucked because I sucked. I don't belong on network television. I belong in Muncie, driving gravel. You got great laughs. Oh, bullshit, if that audience was any deader, there'd be guys in lab coats going through harvesting organs. Those dorks at NBC probably steered in the crowd waiting in line for Donahue by mistake. It's their way of sending a message. - What message? - Oh, come on. The message. Like giving Jay the job as permanent guest host for Johnny. They didn't make him guest host to mess with you. They do everything to mess with me. What do you call renting out our studio in the morning to Maury Povich, for chri--- - Laurie, I need some coffee. - Great show. Yeah. I mean, when are we supposed to rehearse? Am I supposed to move my camera around a bunch of bald women with eating disorders? We won't let that happen, Dave. We'll do something about it. Gosh, Morty, I know, we could boycott the show. They'll probably use that as an excuse to fire me. Oh, come on, Dave. I fucked up number six-- No, you didn't. It was the only decent joke in the whole fucking show-- it was funny! It was funny, I wasn't. Let me see the tape. Take a breather! Give me the fuckin' tape. Oh, man, oh, for Chrissake's! Jesus, do I suck! Oh, that's good, I should've jumped in right there! Listen, you cheap, fuckin' bastard, it's one lousy table, $10,000! That's chump change! That's extortion, Helen. What? That's not extortion. It's charity, for God's sake. It's for pediatric AIDS. You selfish prick! Don't flatter me! Put me down for two. What? Two tables. You are such a mensch! Yes, I still love you. See, that didn't hurt very bad. So, we can have dinner, honey. I gotta go. I gotta go. Jay's here. Bye. - How ya doin'? - Here's your tickets. Where am I going this time? Come, I'll walk you to the car. That's mine. I gotta know my future. I know your future. Follow me! You're playing "Joe Laffs" in Green Bay, Friday. The NBC affiliate is W.L.U.K. Good luck, huh? I'm getting you in just in time to do the noon news. That's good, I'm sure there's a lot of people watching the noon news in Green Bay. Don't give me shit. Those local stations are gonna get you "The Tonight Show." Here, I wanna show you somethin'. Look at this. Oh, please. Not another goddamn motorcycle. I don't have time. Helen, hold on. Take a second and look at this motorcycle. "To J.L., crank it on up, and ride over to CBS forever." It's a rare bike. Do you have any idea what this cost them? No. I don't know what it cost, but I know what it means. - Hi. - Hello. - Table for two? - Please. Are you sure this is the place for a good corned beef sandwich? Yeah. She wanted discreet. I don't think anybody from NBC will be dropping-- Oh, Jesus. What? Arnie Kleiner from Paramount, just walked in with some other guy. Will they know Helen? Here she comes. You said we'd have privacy here. I just saw Arnie Kleiner in the corner downing a Thai beer. Oh, my God, Howard Stringer. Right. A pleasure to meet you, Helen. Rod said we'd just talk a little business over lunch. This looks like a little more than lunch. Of course it is. We wouldn't wanna waste your valued time. Alright... Now, we think the world of Jay. We've noticed what he's been doing filling in for Carson, and we think he's ready to be a star. Right now. And, we have something no one else can offer him. 11:30, wide open. Holy shit. A deal memo already? You guys are serious. Here, you take this. I don't wanna hold on to this. You can give Jay the details without the paper if you prefer. The show opens in September. He'll get six million to start. How does that sound? Six million? Yeah, alright. I'm impressed. But, uh, we may be rushing this a little bit. Jay's a loyal puppy. He's got a thing for "The Tonight Show," like every other comic in America. Of course. But, isn't he still third in that line, behind Carson and Letterman? No, I wouldn't say that. But, I would say that we have some reason to feel a little impatient with where we are. And I'll admit it to you, Howard, I love this offer. I'm sure you do, Helen. Compliments of Mr. Kleiner. This feels like the Late Night DMZ. Does that make me Nixon? I guess I'm Kissinger. With you negotiating, that war would've gone nuclear. At least in this war we control all the weapons. We hope. Hey, Mort, how ya doin'? Good to see ya. Hey, Warren. We got Howard Stringer humping Leno's leg. What are we gonna tell the G.E. guys if we lose him? My dog ate my late night host? I may. Helen needs a stroking. Jay. I hear Howard Stringer wants to take you to Bermuda for a romantic weekend. - Helen. - Hi, how are ya? Jay, honey. It's time to go get your makeup on. Your spot starts in 30 minutes. Manager and network need to be alone. I can take a hint. Brandon, watch your wallet. Hey, David! Oh, hey, Jay. How ya doin'? How ya doin'? - Good. - What's goin' on? Listen, how's NBC treating you? Good, you know. I mean, okay, I guess. Hey, I saw that show the other day with Sandra Bernhard,=. It was great. C'mon, it was great. You don't know what you're talkin' about. It was so funny. I know Morty's down there. I wanna talk to Morty. Hey, are you guys gonna stay around? No, we gotta take the "red-eye" back. I hate the "red-eye." Listen, Jay, we'll have Morty call ya, and we'll book you on the show. When you're not filling in for Johnny. You know me, I'm always ready, whatever, as long as it's okay with Helen. Ah, right, of course. We'll have Morty call Helen and do it that way. I'll talk to you later. Alright, oh, listen, Jay. Call Morty, alright? Yeah, tell him to call Helen. Alrighty. Good to see ya. I gotta tell ya, I got a hell of an offer from CBS. I don't know. I mean, Jay wants to stay and take over when Carson steps down, but, Brandon, I need a commitment. Helen, you're as subtle as a knee to the groin. I didn't hear the words "Tonight Show" in there anywhere. What are you saying? You want us to bounce Johnny now? You wanna deprive him of reaching his 30th anniversary? Just lookin' to protect my guy. Look at her workin' Brandon. Is she shameless or what? David, I don't see any reason, why you shouldn't say hello to Brandon. Oh, for God's sake. Now's your chance to let somebody know that you want "The Tonight Show." Let's wave him over. Jesus, you don't "wave" heads of networks. You wave waiters and hookers and, uh... Brandon. Good Lord, how can a television show be worth this much embarrassment? - Hey, David! - Hey, Brandon. David, I think I heard them call your category, but don't worry, Littlefield ran in to accept for you. Johnny sends his regards, Brandon. Oh, thank you, Peter, too bad he couldn't come. Then I could have been photographed with all our late night stars before they all start filing for free agency. David... I know you want the job as much as Jay. Listen, Brandon, I'm not campaigning for anything. I'm not saying you are. I just want you to know that we haven't forgotten you. Well, that's, uh, that's good to hear, Brandon. Thanks. Sure. I was in New York in July, and I stopped by to see you, but Laurie said you were in rehearsal-- No, actually, I was locked in my office, sobbing. I'm sorry about that. I'll try not to be an anti-social jerk next time. And, Brandon, listen, I really do appreciate it. Sure, Dave. Good luck. I feel like a daddy who's just gotten all his children to bed. Brandon, you shit. We have to talk. Helen, I'm running through a contract negotiation with the guys from "Cheers." Listen, listen, I've had it with this runaround. You don't get by with verbal assurances anymore. See, I had a verbal commitment from Brandon a year ago. Now, he's gone to Paramount. You I'm not so fond of, John. No offense. You think you can pull the same manipulative shit with me you try on everybody else in this town. But you fuck with me, and I'll fuck you back good. See, I don't have a contract with you. I can move Jay to CBS within a month. That would leave you with Carson, and his retirement-home audience. So, let's cut the shit, shall we? Helen, this is just been a busy period. These things take time. You're not listening, asshole! I don't wanna hear about time. I want a piece of paper. I don't know when Carson's gonna get the fucking message and quit. I want Jay signed. Helen, I hear you. Believe me. Let me see what I can do. Give me one week? A week's seven days, John. Trust me, I can count. Right. Jesus Christ. Oh, man. - Hey, Morty. - Have you seen this? Jesus Christ. What the hell is this? From what I can tell, there's no source for it. What's this mean, now, Morty? It means nothing. It means Helen got on the phone. I mean, this has to be Helen. Yeah, but, would NBC treat Johnny this way? This is ridiculous. I can't believe this would've happened if Brandon hadn't gone to Paramount. I mean, he had some control. Helen wouldn't dare pull this shit when Brandon was there. Maybe this is all NBC. It's their way of dealing Jay in. No, don't assume these assholes have a plan. It's the New York Post, for God's sake. - What's that mean? - It's not NBC's style. Alright. Let's see how these guys weasel out of this one. We have to control the rumors. "We have to control the rumors?" You have to control the rumors. So, how do we word the release? Maybe we should just talk about the network's huge debt to Johnny. No words like "and we hope the king will reign for many years to come?" No! Okay. Helen's work, right? What do you think? This probably came from the Carson people. They know they're in trouble. They're tryin' to screw you by leakin' a story. They wanna make you look so fuckin' eager, you'll do anything to get the job. I guess that makes sense. I'm just worried about Johnny. What are you worried about him for? He doesn't worry about you. I don't know. That's the problem. I don't think he really likes me. There you go with that "like" shit again. What the hell difference does it make whether Carson likes you or not? I mean, he's not pickin' his successor. NBC is. Oh, you don't think they'll give him a vote? No, I don't! Would you leave the campaigning to me? Go! Do your fuckin' jokes. I wanna be able to swear to Johnny that this didn't come from us. So, go ahead and swear. Hello. Johnny! Hey, it's Jay. - Jay? - Yeah, how ya doin'? Look, I just wanted to talk to you about this rotten article in the post. I just wanted to tell you, to make it clear to you, that it didn't come from us. Actually, you've been the G.E. employee of the week, haven't you, there, Paul? Gee, Dave, I guess I missed out on that one. Well, it's quite an honor, Paul. Kids, why don't we find out who the G.E. employee of the week is this week. Right here, on our show, we can reveal the name of the G.E. employee of the week. Anton, can we have a-- There we go. Let's see who it is this week, huh, Paul? Warren Littlefield and John Agoglia. Well, this is the reason I went into television. So my family can see me being insulted in front of 4 million people. He's got the microphone, and we're helpless. Forget about it. I've been looking through these ratings charts you sent me. You know how well Jay is doing. Yeah... Prime time revenues are next to nothing. I'm thinking about all the money we've got riding on "Late Night." The last thing we need is a problem there. Well, we've already got one. Helen Kushnick. The woman's forcing the issue. So far we've been able to keep her in line with verbal assurances. Leno's in line for "The Tonight Show." Plus we've committed serious money if Leno doesn't get the show. Two, three million. But she'll forfeit the money, and go to CBS. And that could be a disaster for us. We've still got Carson and Letterman. A lot of people believe that Leno is the hottest talent in television. It would be a major mistake to lose Jay now. Especially, since Johnny doesn't have that long to go. John has never said one word to me about quitting. Well, it may get to the point where we can't wait any longer. You wanna get rid of Johnny Carson? His ratings are softening. Arsenio's got the younger viewers. That's where the money is. We've gotta make sure the future is secure. If we give Jay a firm deal now, give him a contract that guarantees him the show whenever Johnny leaves. I think he and Helen would go for it. Yeah, but, where does that leave us with Letterman? He can't go anywhere. We've got him for two more years. And Letterman's never once asked us to guarantee him the show if Johnny quits. Dave is still our 12:30 guy. We'll make sure he stays there. All we need to do now is get Jay signed-- keep him off CBS. And, this should stay between us, Helen and Jay. Carson doesn't have to know. Letterman doesn't have to know. It never makes the papers. That is essential. I don't want anybody writing that NBC is pushing Johnny Carson out the door. I want this handled very carefully. John and I are friends. But we've gotta have "Late Night" locked up. If that means a deal for Leno... Let's do it. Jay is the host the first week night after Carson's last show. Helen is the executive producer. NBC productions owns the show. Now, of course, no word of this leaves this room. No. Oh... Helen gets this fat check. I think you could say this is the impossible dream coming true for two people, huh? I think, Helen, they've got us where they want us. Well, you see, I would've said it the other way around. Let's give a big hand for the stars of our 1992 fall line-up. Well, you've seen... The new programs for our fall season, and, I hope our affiliates and our friends in the advertising community agree we've put new life into prime time. And, now the last surprise of the day, ladies and gentlemen, the king of late night television soon to begin his 30th year at NBC, heeeeeeeere's Johnny! Thank you. That's very nice of you. Gee, what a fast-paced afternoon. You folks must be just short of a coma. You know, I always get a little awestruck to think of the great men who've graced this stage. Jascha Heifitz. Vladimir Horowitz. And today... Warren Littlefield. Kind of knocks the hell out of Darwin's theory, doesn't it? Jay Leno, who's now the guest host on our show, is driving me nuts backstage. "How're you feeling?" "Your thyroid okay?" You know, I like Jay, and he is very concerned about my health. In fact, he suggested I take a run through Central Park about midnight tonight. Anyway, I know it's been a long afternoon. I just wanna say, this is the last year that I'm doing "The Tonight Show." What did he just say about this being the last year? I don't know. But, my last show is gonna be one year from now, May the 22nd, 1992. I just wanna thank you. I am very grateful... And, I bid you, good-bye. This is real. I just said it. The world heard me. It's real. Great tie, Bob. Terrific. Did you know about this, John? Mr. Littlefield, can I just ask a question? I would like to thank you, Johnny, and, thank you for coming, and the bathrooms are down the hall and to the right. Warren, what the hell is going on? I had no goddamn idea-- We have no release prepared, nothing. Betty, why don't you-- The press is going to fry us like bacon strips is what I'm going to say. ...the advertises and the world with our asses hanging out. I didn't know anything. He didn't say a word to me. So who's it gonna be? Who gets "The Tonight Show?" I'm not gonna answer any questions right now. Is it Leno or Letterman? Stay tuned, everybody. Stay tuned. Thanks, bye. Mr. Leno? There's a phone call for you, sir. I'd like to show you to the the courtesy phone. Oh, alright. Excuse me, aren't you the Doritos guy? Johnny announced he was quittin' today. What? What are you talk-- I was just with him. He went on last, long after you'd gone. He just dumped it on 'em. He said he was doing the show one more year and then out. Did they make any kind of announcement about us? Nothin', they were too busy trying to pull up their pants. But, it'll come. The deal is set. We got it, Jay! One more year! His last show is May 22nd. Our first is May 25th. Memorial Day. God, I'm havin' a hard time gettin' my breath. I'm hearing what my mother always said, "Be careful what you wish for, you might get it." I know what you mean... It's still a secret, right? We can't, you know, say anything about it? We've waited this long. What difference does another day or two make? Yeah, I guess, they wanna, probably wanna tell Dave first. You're such a nice guy, Jay Leno! Worrying about your old friend, Dave? You wanna know the real difference between you and Letterman? You had me. Enough! Now, go do your show in Tahoe. Have a good time. Yes, Sparky! Oh, yes, good boy! Alright, we're gonna be right back with a commercial. Paul, get us out. Hey, Peter, how are ya? Good to see ya. Is John here? Yes, he's here, and he's ready. You're not gonna believe this. Johnny announced his retirement at the affiliates meeting in Carnegie Hall. What do you mean he announced his-- When? When's he gonna retire? A year from now. One more year on the air. That's what he said. Holy shit. And did NBC make an announ-- No. No. No announcement from NBC. Okay, 20 seconds. Can you fucking believe this? Isn't this amazing? Five, four, three, two... Ed couldn't make it. I happened to be in the neighborhood. So, I brought you a little something. What's this? You're the winner of the million dollar sweepstakes. Morty, Johnny asked me to stay on until the show's done, and I told him I would. After that, I'm all yours. That's great. 'Cause we both want you. No, I just happened to be in town doing a something for the affiliates. You quit, Johnny. You quit your job! That's the business you came to-- Jesus Christ, this guy is so good. I cannot fucking believe we haven't heard from Agoglia, Wright or Littlefield. None of 'em. Maybe they lost the number. So, we can handle unpleasant Dave? Well, it's real simple. First we slap him, and then we kiss up. There's only so much kissin' up I'm capable of. I got a signed contract with this guy's name on it. Fuck him and his bruised ego. My ass is bruised from sittin' on a goddamn plane. So, you want Morty to sit behind the desk? Alright, fine. I can do that. Okay, no, no. Is this gonna work, Peter? - Hello. - Hello, gentlemen. Dave will be with you in just a few more minutes. Great, thanks. Can I get you some coffee while you wait? Please, black? Yeah, I'd love some, thanks. Oh, God, they're here. They look like such worms, I tell ya. It's Littlefield. Yeah, Agoglia's with him. Oh, great, thank you. You're welcome. The coffee is freezing. Yeah, yeah, yeah. I can do this. Don't worry. Alright. Thanks, Peter. Morty, sit behind my desk. You sit at the desk. I'm gonna sit right here. And, I'm gonna put them over there. Hi ya, Warren, how ya doin'? Good to see ya. Thanks for coming. And, you are? C'mon, Dave. John Agoglia. Oh, yeah, John. Good to see ya. How ya doin'? Thanks for comin'. Why don't you have a seat over here? Dave, you know why we're here. The network has been analyzing the "Late Night" situation, and we've watched Jay grow into the role of host. Obviously, we have every reason to be proud of what you've accomplished, but a choice had to be made. And, so, tomorrow NBC will announce that Jay Leno has been named the next host of "The Tonight Show." And, I'm sure that Jay will do a fine job. But, I must tell you that we have done this show for 10 years. And, we know how to do this show. Now, the best thing would've been for all of us here to have gone on and done "The Tonight Show." That's what we always wanted to do. And, it's a real disappointment that we're not. But, if it is your final decision... then, you can contact my lawyer. Gentlemen, this is completely unacceptable. I want you to release me from my contract. What is this? I mean, where does this leave us, Morty? I mean, how can we make him happy? You wanna keep him happy? Do as he asks. He wants "The Tonight Show." Well, short of that. We have a plan for enhancing Dave's role on "Late Night." We want to make it a seamless two-hour block right after Jay takes over the show. No, Johnny, you don't understand. Dave wants "The Tonight Show." Period. Well, I'm afraid that just isn't possible. Why isn't that possible? Morty. You already have a deal with Leno? You do, don't you? Let's just say a decision has been made. "A decision has been made?" It's over, so, if you wanna help us out, Morty, you tell me how NBC can make Dave enthused about doing the 12:30 show. Morty! He'll be back. Hold my calls, Pam? Okay, Mr. Morton. Oh, Morty! Ah! Not bad, huh? No, I sucked. No, you didn't suck, Dave. There's something there. I've known those guys... Warren Littlefield has never seen me like that-- David, David-- They thought I was George Peppard or something. - It didn't work... - Well, we don't know that... Yes, we do know. They just told me in their own charming fucking and imitable way. They're going with Jay. As far as NBC's concerned, you're 12:30. And, that's it? Yeah. That's it. Fuck. David, I know you're depressed, but you have to keep fighting. Fighting for what? I'm fucked. I'm finished. My time is up. It's the end of the road for TV boy. David, don't get into that. Do you want The Tonight Show? Why don't you ask me if I want to play centerfield for the Yankees? Of course I want "The Tonight Show." It's my-- Since I was 10 years old, it's the only dream of my whole life. Alright, what are you gonna do about it? You can't just want it. You have to do something. I have done a television program on their network for the last 10 years. What do you want me to do about it? I put a penalty clause in my contract if they don't give me The Tonight Show. How much? A million dollars. Oh, David, that's tip money to those guys. Alright, I'm a pinhead, Pete. I didn't know what I was doing. C'mon, now what'll I do? I just want that show. I'm only really happy that one hour a day when I'm doing my show. You will have a show. You're a television star. People will wanna hire you. Yeah, who, CBS? CBS just fired Pat Sajak. Pat Sajak. Their gums are still bleeding. They don't wanna hear the words "Late Night" ever again. ABC? ABC's got Ted Koppel on at 11:30. He's the gold standard. I'm nickel-plating. So, what does that leave? Syndication? Oh, what a feeling! Can you imagine being sold by a syndicator. "Uh, we got Letterman, or Studs." "You can either have Studs or Letterman." I'm fucked, Pete. Listen, David. Don't accept what NBC is doing to you. You simply can't. You must not follow Jay Leno. Because you'll hate yourself for the rest of your life. It'll make you crazy. Yeah, but, I've already lost the job to him. What else am I gonna do? How about getting an agent? Now, don't reject the idea out of hand. I know how you feel about agents. But, we need somebody with some power in the business. Yeah, I know, but, Jesus, an agent? I mean, an agent's what you pull off the bottom of your shoe after a baseball game. They're just gonna book me in Tahoe with Tony Orlando and Dawn. Listen, David, I have an idea. David. Peter. Mike Ovitz. Please come in. It's wonderful to have you here. David, I don't know if you remember this, but years ago when you were with William Morris and I was still an agent there, we actually met very briefly. Geez, I can't believe you remembered that. What I remember is you were the funniest guy in the room. In fact, I don't think we got much accomplished that day. Michael, maybe we should tell you a little bit about David's circumstances. Peter, I know Dave's circumstances. And, so I know why you're here. Dave is a star of such compelling stature that, frankly, it makes me personally angry he finds himself this abused. We pride ourselves here at C.A.A. in developing a career plan for our clients that protects them as much as it enriches them. David has set such an incredibly high professional standard, and yet he is going disturbingly unrewarded. That just doesn't make sense. It's simply bad business practice. Obviously, we have an intense interest in establishing a business relationship with you, Dave. And with you, Peter. Frankly, we have worked out a career plan for David, and it includes securing everything for Dave that he wants. Everything. Of course, that means an 11:30 television show. Dave will be offered an 11:30 show, and he will be offered it by every network. The geometry of the deal will be far larger. The studios will be in. The syndicators. The full range of the entertainment industry. We shall frame a deal that will make you one of the giants. And, if you give us the privilege of working with you... C.A.A. will take care of everything your talents deserve and your spirit desires. Water? Huh? Jesus, that was like, having a meeting with the... The Godfather. Hello? Hi Warren. Good morning. Theresa told me I'd find you in the car. Good morning, Helen. How are things? Well, I've had it with the Carson people. Tryin' to get anything outta them. They wouldn't put Jay on the show. They wouldn't pass the baton. Pass the what, Helen? Pass the baton. I had this great idea. I thought Johnny should say good-bye Friday, leave his desk, take his hand-held mic, walk over to our studio and hand it over to Jay right on the air... pass the baton. And you suggested this? To whom? Peter Lassally. It was like I peed on his shoe. Well, you know, I think they might wanna finish up on their own terms, Helen. You'll have plenty of time for your own ideas. We sure will, starting Monday. Now, I wanna talk about the ad again. We've been over this, Helen, and, we can't buy an ad for Jay in Friday's paper because we've already bought a full-page ad there to say good-bye to Johnny. Why can't NBC buy a full-page ad to welcome Jay to face Johnny's ad? Because, as I told you before, the paper's doing its own full page of stories saluting Johnny on the page opposite the ad, and we're not gonna crowd that with a "Welcome Jay" ad. That's it. End of story, Helen. No, it's not end of story, Warren. I'm telling you now, that ad's goin' in on Friday. If NBC won't buy the fucking thing, then I'll pay for it myself, but that ad is going in. No, it isn't going in, Helen, and it's not gonna be your money, and you're not doing it because I will not allow it. We've thought about it, we've listened, and we've made a decision, and that decision is final. Boy, I knew I could expect shit like this from a dickless wonder like you. - Well, fuck you, Helen. Fuck you and the horse you rode in on! You're wrong. We're not gonna do this. I will not allow it. You closed Jay's contract, didn't you? You are out of your fucking mind! But, I got the fucking show anyway. I can see that this man is embraced by this-- It's your only natural talent Warren. Fucking up! And, enough. It's over. Done. So, this is it, huh? I am one of the lucky people in the world because I got to do something I've always wanted to do, and I've enjoyed every minute of it. And, I can only tell you, it's been an honor to come into your homes, and let me entertain you. And, I hope when I do find something that I wanna do, you will still invite me into your home as you always have. I bid you a very heartfelt good-bye. Is this where you want me to stand? I always stand right here. Where the fuck is Billy Crystal? And why hasn't he arrived yet? Stand up straight, for Chrissake. You're the host of The Tonight Show! So, Jay, how's it goin'? Aw, you know me. Yeah, Mr. Stress. You look like you're ready to take a nap. Maybe I will. I just want to get it over with. You know what I want to talk to you about? I think we should lose the second Perot joke. Listen, Jay. Don't you think it would be appropriate to say something nice about Johnny early in the show, you know? That wasn't my decision. Yeah, but still, I mean... Bob Wright? Him, I guess, I have to talk to. Hi, Bob! So nice of you to check in today. Thanks, Helen. I just called to wish Jay well tonight. I'm sure he's gonna have a great show. Oh, thanks. I'm doing everything I can to make sure that happens. I'm sure you are. Listen, Helen. I did have one other thought. What's Jay gonna do to thank Johnny? We're not gonna do anything. - I'd like to hear why. - You wanna know why? Okay. The new show is going to be entirely different from the old show. We don't want to look like we're beholden to Johnny's old audience. Get that outta here! Every comic knows you salute the last guy to get more applause for yourself. I mean, that's kiss-up stuff. Jay doesn't do kiss-up. I think it's a terrible mistake, Helen. It boils down to simple politeness. Now, I would really like for you to go down there and tell Jay to say something like-- "I wouldn't be here but for John." No, I'm not gonna go to Jay one hour before a live broadcast and tell him to insert some tribute to Johnny Carson. Absolutely not. But, I appreciate your good wishes, and I'll tell Jay you called. From the NBC studios in Burbank, The Tonight Show with Jay Leno. Featuring Branford Marsalis and The Tonight Show band. Tonight, Jay welcomes comedian Billy Crystal. And musical guest Garth Brooks. And now, Jay Leno! You're gonna love this. I got official notice from C.A.A. "All future business activity for David Letterman will be handled through Michael Ovitz's office." What, they fired Ovitz? What, is he trying to get sprung? He'd have to hire God for that! Well, let's think about this. Dave didn't hire Mike Ovitz to get a five-year-deal out of us to stay at 12:30. That's not a big enough move for him. Now, this only works if he gets 11:30 for Dave. You're not listening, Warren. Dave can bring Machiavelli back from the dead. It still does not do him any good. I made this deal. We've got full protection. What is he gonna do? Ovitz, huh? Put him on television in Venezuela! Come on. This Letterman contract has clauses in it a prisoner wouldn't have! How the hell do we get him out of it? Give me all the bad news. Whatever deal we make they have a right to match, and they can take a full year to match which means they could keep him off the air if they want. That sounds like something you'd have in a deal for a sports announcer from some local radio station. It gets worse. NBC has first negotiating position. We can't even talk a deal with anybody but them for 18 months. No offers. Nothing. Okay, so we don't negotiate. We can still talk to people, right? Sure, we can talk. What then? Then we set up pitches. We can't pitch Letterman around, Mike. NBC would challenge it. No, we don't pitch David Letterman to anybody. They pitch themselves to us. We reverse the process. And it's legal too? Yes! We can't stop somebody from talking to us. Pardon me. Rod. Howard! Oh, I beg your pardon. I made the plane in 14 seconds! I'm glad you made it. We need you here. All the heavy weights are coming in. I heard Eisner's going to be pitching Disney himself. I wish they'd made it clearer earlier that this was a true pitch. Morton called me yesterday and told me they'd see me here. That's the first time I knew I had to come. All I had in the Hamptons was this old suit. And then I get on the plane, I realize I have no bloody cuff links. Paper clips. I'm just afraid Letterman will see them and conclude that Larry Tisch is an even bigger tight-wad than G.E., which isn't far wrong. Hello, Rod. Hi, Rod. Gentlemen, I'm sorry. We're under a bit of a time constraint, so I just wanted to say that we're here because we wanna get acquainted with how you do business and to see how Dave might fit in with your plans. I would like to reiterate this is not a negotiation. It is, for want of a better word, a process. So, Howard, would you like to speak for CBS? Terrific. David, I know that you have an appreciation for the history and tradition of broadcasting. Much of that tradition has been written by CBS. Even in England, we knew Jack Benny, and Lucy and Gleason. Does David Letterman fit that tradition? Like a glove. The point is, the CBS of the present, can give you what you want, David-- affiliate strength. Strong management, excellent promotion, and, yes, we have space available at 11:30 every weeknight. And we're a network. We're what you want, Dave. We're a home. Michael. Thank you so much for coming. You have a young audience. We're the young network. We're also the only ones capable of offering you a start time of 11pm. That will give you the jump on Mr. Leno. Hiya Robert. Good to see you. Thank you so much for coming. ABC has always been the network for the young viewers. We know how to reach that audience and deliver it to you. I'm not gonna say here today what we're gonna do about Nightline, but... Hi, Al. Thank you for coming. I appreciate it. We'll build the entire syndication operation at Columbia around David Letterman and Late Night. We expect we could launch nationally with a lineup of stations as strong as any network's. Ah, that sounds great, Bob. Uh, Alan... Whatever. Hi, Brandon. I appreciate it. Thank you. At Paramount, we've proved with Arsenio we already know how to make late night work in syndication. I think it's a perfect match-- Arsenio followed by Letterman. I'd follow the example of their nominee... ...don't inhale! Listen to this old fool. On and on and on and on. It's getting close to 11:00. The local news will start late. Get Warren on the phone. Great. We reschedule our fucking lives to do a live show so Jay can follow up their ghastly convention coverage with some new jokes. Then they won't let us on the goddamn air. Motherfuckers in news fucking us again! Warren, they're letting this go on. He's not gonna finish by 11. I swear to you, I'm sending my audience home if you don't get this over on time. No, I'm not losing it! You said you had this under control! Look, a pause! Right there! They could've cut him off! Get me Gartner in Houston, goddammit! It's 11pm in the east right now! Mr. Gartner. Phone for you. Helen Kushnick on the line. Yeah, Gartner here. You promised me you'd be off by 11, you shit-head. I'm goin' live tonight so we can get some pay-off from your horseshit convention coverage. I'm accommodating you by giving Brokaw air time with Jay. You get this gas bag Reagan off the air now, or I'm not using Brokaw tonight. I don't give a shit if you use Brokaw tonight or any other night, lady. And let's get something straight. I'm the president of NBC news. You don't have anything to do with what I do. I'm taking you off the air this time, you pompous ass. There's only one person who can take me off the air. Bob Wright. I'll give you his number. Call him. I don't need to call Bob-fucking-Wright. I'll send my audience home, and then you can call him and explain why "The Tonight Show" wasn't on the fucking air. Because the news asshole couldn't get a horseshit speech off on time! Send 'em home! Get them the fuck out of here! Helen, is this a good idea? I mean, can you do this? Hey, who the fuck made you the executive producer? You do the fucking jokes. I run the fucking show. I've made the decision. They fucked us, so now they don't get a show. Get these fucking people out of here now! There is no show for them to see! Ladies and gentlemen, we have, what you might call technical difficultys right now. It's a heck of a thing. Have you been watchin' the convention coverage? I could've been a doctor! Yeah, well, it's not too late, Rick. Oh, Rick. We're running a little late, but I think we're gonna be alright. The show should start... I think around 11:45... That's great Warren, but I wanted to, um... - Would you hold that thought? - Well, I was about to call. What, what... what? You know, what the hell? That ship has sailed, there's nobody here. Jesus Christ. She... What, she sends the audience home? We don't have a Tonight Show? You know, I've already sold this thing to advertisers. Christ! She killed a scheduled show! My level of tolerance with Helen Kushnick is completely used up. So is ours. That woman cancelled "The Tonight Show" with no authorization whatsoever. We had less than half an hour to get that repeat on, or we would have gone dark. She is completely out of control. That's become apparent to everybody now, Bob. The problem is, what do we do about it? If we make a move on Helen now, Jay could be injured, maybe irreparably. The guy seems to be totally dependent on her. That's his problem, not ours. It's ours if Jay walks off the show. And the ratings have been solid. I hate to tamper with the show. Maybe... Maybe we should just limp along for the a while. Yeah, and wait for her to self-destruct. She will. Soon. The way she's going. Then it won't be an issue with Jay... And we won't have to pay her off. I think it's more apparent than ever before that we should keep our options open with Letterman. If you two want to limp along with this situation for now, that's your call. But at some point, and it's getting to be soon, it's gonna be my call. I'd just like to say, thank you, to all of you for this wonderful tribute. It has been one of the most memorable nights of my life. Thank you. Excuse me. Maybe it's time for us to talk, Bob. You heard about Kushnick, huh? I'm not going to get in the middle of whatever it is you need to do about Kushnick. But, if you think it's time to get serious about doing something with Dave, I have a few suggestions. I'd like to hear them. - Well... - I think it's important... Hi, how are you? Good to see you. Nice to see you. I think it's important for NBC, if you're really serious about keeping Dave, to start creating some goodwill. There's enough animosity in this relationship to start a small war. In my mind it's all been stupid and unwarranted. Thank you. I'm all for goodwill. What do you have in mind? Well, we are prevented from pursuing offers for David because we are required by NBC to negotiate with them first. But that clause only serves to insure that David is not going to listen to any initial offers that you might make, generous as they may be, because naturally he is going to want to test the waters elsewhere. So we can all play this game, or we could just loosen the chains a little bit. How? You can allow us to solicit other offers openly. After all, you still retain matching rights. Seems like we're conceding a lot for the sake of goodwill. Maybe you can offer something in return? Our sales department tells me that we've sold the Letterman show to the end of June. But, as you know, David's contract is up April 2nd. So, if we don't resign him, we'll have to return that money. Unless... Unless we give you a three month extension. Okay, alright, so that's the deal. We give you three months, and you free us up to negotiate. Do you think David would see that as a gesture of goodwill? I believe I can assure you that he would. Hello, Howard. Mike! Listen, we're ready to talk seriously now. Robert Morton on three. Morty, how are things in New York? New York is great. It's great to talk to you too. I'm sure you're quite busy with the show. Yeah, I'm damn busy. So what's up? Well, you've probably been too busy to realize that you've double booked one of our guests. Apparently you've got Roger Daltry the same week we've got him. Now, I'm sure this is just an oversight by your staff, but I thought I should call and just let you know the way we work things. You see, we always had this sort of "gentlemen's agreement" with Johnny... Hey, Morty, haven't you noticed, I'm no gentleman! Well, Helen, it's just that the record company is telling us you're trying to force Daltry into cancelling his appearance with us. I mean, he's our guest, Helen. He is? Well, let me help you out here, Morty. You have no power with NBC to back you up on guests. You really think NBC is gonna back your show over mine? Your guy was the loser, remember? That's a cheap shot, Helen! Well, you can expect more where that came from! You have no fuckin' clue what's goin' on at the network. You're helpless. You really ought have me do your next contract for ya. You're making bupkis next to me. You know, I thought we were friends. I really did. But, you know, let me tell you something, I will fight you on Daltry, and I will fight you on every guest you try to steal. Ooh, good luck, Mighty Mouse! It's Kushnick on one. Helen! Kenny, I'll get right to the point. We see Travis's billboards all over town. We want to book him. Gee, that's great, Helen. I mean, that's really nice. So when do you want to... I mean we want him this week when he's here for the concert. Gee, I'm sorry. - He's on Arsenio on Wednesday. - Yeah, I know. My bookers told me. So, cancel it. I mean, Arsenio's over with. He's in the toilet. His advertisers are desertin' him. By the end of the year there won't even be an Arsenio. Well, he's on the air now, and we're committed there. I guess you're not hearing me. Let me spell it out for you-- if you want Travis on this show ever again, you better break that date with Arsenio. I think you need to know something about me. I don't respond well to threats. Look, maybe I could offer you something else. We have a movie of the week coming up we need to promote with Kenny Rogers, Travis and Naomi Judd. What if I could get them all on the same show... Excuse me, this ain't Merv Griffin. We don't do fuckin' theme shows, you dumb shit-kickin' hick! Let me break the news to ya. Not only is Travis Tritt not gonna do "The Tonight Show" ever again, but you and I are gonna be in this town for a long time. We're gonna see each other, and we're never gonna to talk again. It's your fucking loss. And the record company's. Ken, the booking office from Leno just called.. Trisha Yearwood's appearance has been cancelled. Trisha Yearwood has been booked with Leno for months. How can Helen get away with this crap? Well, I'm not going to take it! Get me Robert Hilburn at the L.A. Times. Brace yourself, Warren. Ken Kragen has gone public about Helen. Holy hell is breaking loose. This is it! Even Jay can see she's totally out of control. Independent verification. Helen has one option. She accepts this redefinition of duties, or she's off the show. "Can't book guests"... I don't do that already. We have bookers for that. "Can't cancel guests"... I've never canceled a guest, no matter what the fuckin' L.A. Times says. "Cannot talk to the media." Well, that's a relief. Who needs that? This is no redefinition of my duties. It's what I've been doin' all along. And if you sign this, we'll hold your feet to the flame on every issue. You know, when they put John Sununu out of the White House, everything fell apart. You guys just want me to prove I can be a good little girl, huh? Would any of this be pulled with a male executive producer? Bullshit! Well, okay, I can be a good little girl. Who the fuck are you to tell me what to do? Try to control yourself, Helen. Stop fucking with me, Warren. I know what you're up to. You've made a mess of prime time. You know you can't measure up to the job Brandon did! So this is all you can do to try to save your own ass, is to come after me. Hey, Warren, did you know they're talking to Don Ohlmeyer for your job? And Kerry McCluggage? So go fuck yourself, Warren. I mean, you've had a lot of practice at that, right? Helen! She'll never make it as a diplomat. If you love her, get her out of here. - She needs help, Jay. - We all need help, Warren. The numbers are still good, isn't that what's important? It doesn't matter. You're approaching disaster. Helen has pushed too far. The whole town is rising up against her. It's not as easy as you think. Helen made all this happen for me. Everything. You know what I was doin' before I met Helen? You know what I was doin'? I was workin' in strip clubs! You know? I wasn't gonna be on any television show. An agent once told me that I had a face that would scare small children. Look at me. I'm the host of The Tonight Show. Helen Kushnick got it for me. And she could lose it for you, too. Great! 17 years, you know, is an awful long... Her son died of AIDS, you know. The hospital gave him a bad transfusion. A 3-year-old baby! That was a terrible tragedy, Jay... Her husband got colon cancer. He died a year after that... She had a mastectomy... Jerry Kushnick on his deathbed, on his deathbed, he asked me to take care of her. I recognize you have intense feelings about this. You have every reason to feel loyalty to Helen, but we're past that. Now, I was a psychology major in college, and what John and I are doing with you now, we would have to call an intervention. What you see as loyalty to a woman who has suffered deeply, we see as a form of addiction. Now, she cannot continue to produce a television show in this condition. Helen is either gonna take you down, or you are going to separate from her. But she is not going to take me down. She is fired. If we have to, we'll bar her from the lot. What if I were to walk out with her? Well, if you can't separate from Helen, that's a big mistake. I regret it, but we have choices to make. And the choice I have to make is to tell David Letterman that it's time to take over The Tonight Show. I suspect that Peter Lassally and David could be in Burbank on 24 hours notice. You guys would do that to me? I will absolutely do that. That's how strongly we feel. I need a commitment from you Jay. Will you be at work tomorrow? Is what you're saying is that if I don't come to work, I'm gonna be fired? I'm not saying that exactly. But is that what you mean? You mean that I'm gonna be fired if I don't show up for work? Jay, are you looking for some legal justification for breaking with Helen? It's a simple question. Just tell me. If I don't come to work tomorrow, are you gonna fire me? Yes, I guess we're saying that. You guys can let yourselves out. Agoglia handed this to me when I came in. They're firing me. I told him you'd never stand for this. What do you want me to do about it, Helen? Issue a statement backing me. Then we just go on with the show. Just like that? Aren't you still fired? Not if you don't accept it. They'll never let you go. All you have to do is threaten to quit. They'll cave. They've got no balls. You know what they told me? They told me they were gonna fire me and bring in David. That's what they told me. Oh, bullshit! These guys hate Letterman. All we gotta do is stay strong, honey. No. You know? Everything is all out of control now. Hey, hold it. Don't you give me this shit too. Not you. Who the hell do you think pulled you out of those shit-hole clubs? Who got you on television? On Letterman? I remember. You, who wasn't blonde, who wasn't from the midwest. 15 years ago? This town? The Carson people? They wouldn't let you play on their field! So, I had to move the game. Sorry, assholes, the game's over here now. I moved the game! Who the hell do you think forced Carson out so you could get the best fuckin' job in comedy? Forced Carson out? Johnny quit! Sure he quit! Because he couldn't take the heat anymore. I got the affiliates on your side. I got the network to kiss your Italian ass. I got page one of the fucking New York Post to bury that fossil Carson. All for you! What do you mean you got page one of the Post? You told me we didn't have anything to do with that story. For Chrissake, grow up. You lied to me? We've always played the same game. You never want to know what I'm doing for you, so you can be Mr. Nice Guy. "Booking war, what do I know? Helen handles that. I do the jokes." You just want me to keep servin' you the steaks. You never wanna know how I'm slaughtering the cow. I can't believe you lied to me. We needed the story. It helped us. I did it for you! I called Johnny. And I told him it didn't come from us. Because you told me that it didn't come from us. I can't believe you had me lie to Johnny Carson. Big fucking deal! So go to fucking confession! I got a show to do, Helen. Goddammit! What are you doin'? Jay, honey, let's get this ironed out. We can work something out with NBC. No Helen. They want you out. So do I. What about taking care of me and my kid? You sat there on Jerry's deathbed. You said, "I'll take care of your wife and daughter." I heard you say that! I did say that, and I meant it then. But, now, Helen, you almost cost me this job. You don't need this job. Listen, I've been on the phone. I guarantee us a job. 25 million. We can walk out of here. Good-bye, Helen. Don't you leave me, you two-faced bastard! What do you want to do? You wanna break this? You wanna break this! It's broken. Warren Littlefield's office. Yeah, it's Jay. Is he in? Sure. Yeah, Warren? You gotta help me through this. Absolutely. You gotta help me through it. I'm moving forward with you. - I'm doin' the show. - Great. She's no longer the executive producer. I'm no longer in business with Helen Kushnick. I had a wonderful time! We've got a great show tomorrow night! Good-bye! Can you guys come in here please? Hey, everybody, come on in here. I just have a few things I wanna say to everybody. It'll just take a few minutes, okay? Come on. Come on in. Great show tonight. First, I should say that... So I wanted to just take a few minutes to apologize for all the craziness that's been goin' on around here the past few months. Now, I listened to Helen, and it was a mistake, and I shouldn't have done it, and I'm sorry for it. So, please stay with me. I'm gonna try and make it up to each and every one of you, and let's just keep doin' the best shows that we can do, alright? So to you, I thank you very much. Thank you so much. Way to go, Jay! We're behind you! What a place! Oh my God, there's more fruit in here! Is it scurvy, Mike? Can you see it? Is it on my skin? Pete, have a seat, and take that silly rug off, will ya? Now, Morty, for God's sake, straighten your tie. This isn't a tractor pull! Alright, here we go! Let's get this thing started. Well, these are summaries of all the offers David has on the table. They're all in the same range-- 12 to 14 million a year, depending on how well you do. We also have a couple of those oversized syndication offers, like the 50 million from Viacom... Listen, syndication gives me the willies. He wants a network. Now, ABC passed because we wouldn't accept midnight after "Nightline". FOX is... Well, FOX is FOX. They're about three quarters of a network, at best. So, that leaves us with CBS. Suddenly our options are narrowed. Listen, the good news is, David, that CBS has really stepped up. They're offering you 12.5, but that, of course, will escalate as your demographics improve. Yeah, but, Mike, what did they say about the clearance issue? I mean, look, NBC is putting The Tonight Show on, what, 99% of affiliates... We're only get about 65% of the affiliates in year one. Howard Stringer promises that they'll get it up to 90% by the end of year three, at the very, very latest. Now, in spite of these limitations, Dave, I think that Stringer is an extremely competent executive. And if you go to CBS, there is no doubt you will become their number one signature star. And I can't put a price tag on that. There is one problem that we now have to deal with. And that is that NBC still has the right to match this offer within 30 days. So, NBC matches the offer, and I'm stuck at NBC at 12:30 for the rest of my life! Not necessarily... We've come up with something extra. The CBS deal has a penalty clause. CBS agrees to give you a show that airs before midnight Eastern time, or they owe you 50 million. - 50 million! - Man! That's no penalty. That's capital punishment. It's not even gonna faze CBS because they're giving you 11:30 anyway. But it's going to make NBC choke. Cool! It is C.A.A.'s formal recommendation that you accept the CBS offer, and so inform NBC. Congratulations, Dave. - Taxi! - Where are you goin'? I got a date downtown. Really, another one? Who's left? David. You know there's still one promise Ovitz hasn't kept. Yeah, well, maybe NBC's happy with what they got. If NBC were to offer you The Tonight Show, would you still accept it? Peter, we've had this conversation. Of course I would. You know I want that show. I just wanted to hear you say it again. Where are you goin'? Pete? David? Bob Wright is here to see you. - Here? - Mm-hmm. Hello, David! Heya, Bob, how are ya? Good to see ya. Thanks for comin'. Pete, why don't you come on in... I'm sorry, I have things to do down the hall. - Thanks, Peter. - You bet, Bob. Hey, Bob. Thanks for comin' on down. Oh, thank you for having me. Make yourself at home. Oh, you like that? Here, you want one? There you go. - Thank you. - You own it. David... I really don't want you to leave your family here at NBC. I'm here because I want desperately to prevent that. I wanna offer anything I can. Is there anything I can offer to get you to stay? Well, those are warm sentiments, Bob. Thank you. Well, of course, you know I would stay. But you've already filled your 11:30 slot. I can offer almost anything else. Prime-time, specials... I know, Bob... I know. It's just-- prime-time... and the... I'm a creature of late night. You know? I always have been, I mean, that's who my audience is. The guys on the west coast say that you may have trouble adjusting to 11:30. Alright, listen. Those guys are entitled to their opinion, but, I'm tellin' you I think that they're wrong. I think that I am ready, and I've given a lot of thought to what it will take shift to an 11:30 position. I know it's a different audience. And if that means booking different types of guests, or country music mixed in with the rock, or whatever it takes. And I can also temper my own act. I'm a professional. I know how to do that. I have no doubt that you can. And I see that you have given this a lot of thought. Well, I have. But, all the same, I just have to tell ya, that it's time. I gotta move up. And if I don't do it now, I'm not ever gonna do it. It's time to move. John. Have you heard anything new from Ovitz? Nothing new. Nothing old. - Lots of nothing. - Nothing. Great. So, what's Wright saying? He says he's waitin' to hear from Ovitz. He's leaning towards Letterman. I know. I told Jay, west coast is behind him, but I can't speak for New York. You're worried about Boca? Once again, Jay and Dave are in competition with one another. Now, New York likes Dave so much they don't wanna let him go. Jimmy, I like Dave. He's my friend. I love this show. I'm not asking them to not like Dave! Why does it have to be either or? These network guys. You know? They can't make up their mind. They think they can just flip a coin. Dave or Jay, Jay or Dave. It doesn't matter to them. Do you think that's what the meeting's about? Choosing between you and Dave? I don't care what the meeting's about. I've given them everything they've asked for. I've given them the demos. I've given them the numbers... If I'm the one goin' down, I'm goin' down swingin'! Hey, where's Rick Ludwin? He left to be in on that conference call from Boca. Guess what that's gonna be about? Hey, everyone, I'm gonna cut the post-mortem a little short tonight. I got some things to do, but it was a great show, really. I'll talk to you tomorrow. And I'll see you at the house later. Alright? Okay, thanks. Are you reading us okay? Can you hear us? Yeah, I hear you all fine. You settled in? You ordered the pizza yet? Thanks for joining us, Rick. I know it's late, and we're all tired, but we're here to discuss and hear out everybody's opinion on what we should do about Late Night. I think this should have been settled long before now. Jay has the job. He's doing great. He has a great attitude. Whoa, wait a minute. I thought we were talk this thing out. Not do self-serving commercials. If you want the executive producer job that bad, Rick, kiss Jay's ass in private, okay? We all see the job Jay is doing. His selection of musical acts. Unoriginal comedy past the monologue. And his piss-poor interviewing. Which, by the way, looks like it will never get any better. Let's talk about what we think it would really cost us to match CBS's offer for Letterman. And, on the other hand, if Leno quits to go to CBS, are we out from under the 10 million dollars that we'd owe him if we fired him? Warren, I've got some serious concerns here. I don't think you can just throw off Jay with a couple of--- Jack, it's very good of you to come so late. Please sit. And keep talking, everybody. I'm just here to listen. Sorry it's so warm. The air conditioning went out. Warren, why don't you continue? My fear is that Letterman won't cooperate. It isn't in his personality. He'll stiff us. Remember, this is the guy who kicks NBC executives out of his anniversary parties. - That's an old story. That is so petty. - Excuse me. Excuse me for a minute... There's still a serious question that his act can play an hour earlier. And a lot of us think it won't. And don't forget. With Leno, we own the show again. Letterman wants to own his show. Then he has all the ancillary profits. May I say something here? Jack, please, of course. I'm not a regular Late Night viewer, so I wouldn't presume to make a call about who's the best comedian. All I want to say is this-- as always I'm for whatever is the best business deal. That's for you, Bob, and your people to determine. However, if the decision comes down to a tie on all angles, well, I'd cast my vote for loyalty. Goodnight. Goodnight Jack. Thanks very much for dropping by. I think that about wraps it up, folks. We'll meet again tomorrow. Hey, Warren, it's Jay. How ya doin'? Hey, you know, you're probably all tired from sitting through those boring G.E. meetings all morning. I betcha I'm catching you just as you're about to sit down on the toilet. That was quite a meeting you had last night. I hope that G.E. protects it's nuclear secrets better than they protect their Late Night secrets. I thought it was too bad to hear that Dick Ebersol was no Jay Leno fan. Although it was good to know that Jack Welch was is in favor of loyalty. You know, as long as it came down to a "tie on all angles." Holy shit, Jay! How the hell did you get your information? Well, you know, I may look stupid, but I'm Italian. I know how to find information. Listen, Jay, don't tell anybody about this. Warren, you don't have to worry. Your secrets are safe with me. I won't break the G.E. code. Listen, just have a wonderful time in beautiful sunny Florida! Betty? We have a security leak of enormous proportions. Paul Schaffer, ladies and gentlemen. Well, that sucked! Let's see how bad we can write tomorrow's. John, you have some top ten... Yeah, the top ten reasons Sinead O'Connor hates the pope. No, no, no can do. We got a memo from NBC. Standards and practices is rip-shit over her tearing the pope in half on Saturday Night Live. I don't care... write the jokes. No Sinead O'Connor jokes, Dave. And now NBC's telling us what jokes we can and can't do? Something in that survey "tasty hot meal" on my desk? Ah, fuck. Alright, the top ten jokes that NBC won't let us do. Peter liked it. Peter liked that joke. Laurie, you like that joke? Yeah. Mike Ovitz is on line one. Alright, fellas, let's go. I gotta take this call. Come on, it's adult swim. Get outta here. Don't come back until it's funny. You guys wanna hear this? Oh, yeah. Alright, you ready? Hi ya Mike. How are ya? Dave, one hour ago Bob Wright conveyed to us an offer for you to host The Tonight Show. Now, don't jump to any conclusions. Let me lay all this out. The deal is three years with an option. The salary range is 7 to 12 million. Now, here's the wrinkle. The deal does not commence until May of 1994. 18 months from now. What's all that about? It's rather transparently NBC's attempt to keep both you and Leno, at least for a while. The May date, as I understand it, coincides with the end of Leno's contract as the host of The Tonight Show. - But I get the show? - Yes. - I just don't get it now? - No. - I get it a year from May? - Yes. And they don't force Jay out? No, unless he quits, which I assume that he might. Maybe that's what they want him to do. Jay's gonna quit? Not a chance. Not a chance. Jesus, can you believe this? Dave, let me point out a few more things. CBS is offering more salary. CBS is offering ownership. CBS is also offering for the show to start in the fall. NBC the following spring... maybe. What's that? What's maybe? I mean that the deal is obviously very smoky in many details. But I get the show, right? No, not necessarily, David. The waiting period gives Jay 18 months to make the show a hit. And if he does, you can bet NBC will find a way to weasel out of the deal. Honestly, Dave, C.A.A. sees no reason to change its recommendation. Mike, listen. You don't understand. It is every driver's dream to drive a Ferrari. And now you're asking me to give that up. Well, I can probably buy some time. The NBC deadline is Monday. I could get Agoglia in here on Saturday and Sunday and have him start drawing up papers. Yes, yes. Get Agoglia in there. I'm not gonna be the only guy whose weekend is ruined by this. Have Agoglia drag his tired ass to C.A.A. while I'm up in Connecticut in hell trying to figure out what the fuck I'm going to do with my life! Dave? - Dave! - What? Hello, David. Hiya, Pete! Welcome to my weekend in hell! - No movement since Friday? - No. And Agoglia's not puttin' anything in writing. Ovitz says NBC can't take the risk that it'll leak. And Jay will figure out that they offered his job to me. Can you imagine if the press heard about this? Do you think Jay knows? No. How can he? But, David, it is worth thinking about what it will mean to Jay if you take this. It means that you will be denounced in the press for shoving an old friend under a train. Jeez. I mean, that's horrible. I can't worry about that. Have you talked to anybody else? Yeah, I talked to everybody. I talked to Hal, Morty, Rob, Jude... And what did they say? They all said the same thing. It's a shitty deal. CBS offered a better one. I tell ya, Pete. I'm still thinking of taking it. - I want that show. - What show? - I deserve that show! - Johnny's show? Don't you get it, David? They are not offering you the "Johnny Carson Tonight Show." That is gone forever. They're offering you damaged goods. They're offering you the Jay Leno show. And they're not even offering it now. They're making you wait. I lost that show once, Pete. I'm not gonna do it again. I can't-- I just can't say no. Then don't say yes yet. Make one more phone call. Why are you doing this to me? Don't you understand? I don't care. I cannot lose The Tonight Show twice. Once to Jay Leno... And once because I was too dumb to take a second chance. They're offering me a second chance, Pete! David, you don't understand. I am the guy that moved heaven and earth to get you that second chance. And I'm tellin' ya, it's not right. It's leftovers. It's shoddy. Call the one guy in all the world who can help you figure this out. Hello. Uh, Johnny. It's Dave. I hate to bother you on a Sunday like this, but... I know why you're calling, Dave. Peter filled me in on the NBC offer. Listen, I just hate to put you on the spot like this. But, you may be the only guy who really understands this sort of thing, and I... What do you think? I think you gotta do what's best for your career. I mean, do what's in your heart. Johnny, it's just those two things seem to be in direct conflict. It's just so tough! I just have to ask you straight out, Johnny. What would you do? Well, Dave, I would probably walk. Now, I'm not telling you to do that. But if you're asking me what I would do if I was treated like this. Yeah. I would probably walk. Yeah, I imagine you would, Johnny. Listen, I just really appreciate this. It's just awfully nice of you. Thanks. Good luck, Dave. Everyone here wants to know what's going on in Late Night. And the answer is... the host of The Tonight Show will continue to be Jay Leno! How ya'll doin'? Don't let these NBC guys out of your sight! Oh, hi ya, Warren. How are ya? Welcome to NBC, which stands for-- Never Believe Your Contract! They say that we live in a time of lowered expectations. They must be right, because look at this. You're all here, and I have the job. What we're celebrating is that I haven't been fired! Okay. Let's go. It's our turn now. Hold it. Gentlemen, we are just going from one bizarre circumstance to the next. I never dated Amy Fisher. I helped her with her homework. I fixed her car. And that's it! Thank you, and goodnight. What about Paul Shaffer? Is he coming along? - Paul who? - Paul Shaffer. Oh, Paul Shaffer! Oh, no, God! We forgot about Paul! Howard, is there just a little bit left over for Paul Shaffer? Dave? Dave. Are you gonna kick Jay Leno's ass? I'm gonna kick your ass, buddy! Is your comedy too hip for 11:30? Well, you people seem to be keeping up. Do you realize what we've got riding on Jay Leno? A whole lotta money and my ass. Dave's really good.
