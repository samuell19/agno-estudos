My father would make a big breakfast. Scrambled eggs, waffles, bacon. And he always made the best bacon, too. Then we would get into our Cadillac. Boy, did he keep that car waxed until it gleamed. Then we'd go off on a new adventure. You never knew what was gonna happen next with my father. Only knew it was gonna be fun. Willie, you son of a bitch! My father was a big track star when he was in school. You should've seen him run. I see you, Willie! Your ass is grass! Get him, Dad! Come on, Louie. Don't fall behind. LOUIE: He owned most of the buildings in the neighborhood. And I'll tell you, people really looked up to him. Deadbeat, son of a bitch! Where's the rent? Hey, I'm a little short right now. About another week. Another week? Another week? What do you say, Louie? Shall we give him another week? Okay. Okay You sure? Remember, that $3 I give you every week really isn't an allowance, it's more like a percentage. You let this guy skate, that means you only get $2.70, okay? Now, remember, the other tenants are gonna want another week. You know what that means? Pretty soon you'll be down to nothing, zero, zip. No ice cream. No soda. No candy. You wanna steal candy outta my kid's mouth? No, man, no. Then gimme what you got. Friday, Willie. I want the rest, Friday. Yeah, don't hold your breath. One down, 63 to go. There you are, Louie. You're $1 short, Dad. No, it's all there. Take another look. You might've made a mistake. Dad. January's a very tough month. So is December. Gimme my money. That's my boy. LOUIE: Yeah, Sundays were always the best. BIG LOU AND IRENE: * Happy birthday to you * * Happy birthday to you * * Happy birthday, dear Louie * * Happy birthday to you * Surprise! Surprise! BIG LOU: It's all yours. Your first building. You're a landlord, now, like your old man. It's just a start, but someday all my buildings will be yours. Thanks, Big Lou. * Hit it * * Hit it! * Okay, assholes. Here comes Kritski. * Oh * * Oh * * Oh, yeah * * Hit it! Hit it! * * Hit it! Hit it! * ...goes in and out, all day! In, out, in, out, in, out! See, that's how the door broke. You're supposed to go in and stay in! She goes out to buy milk, gets one milk. She goes out to get eggs, gets two eggs. You get 'em by the dozen, pal. You ever hear of a dozen? A dozen! No entiendo... Es no bueno, no good. It's broken. But it worked before you broke it! It ain't my problem! It worked... It worked before you broke it! Listen. BOTH: No, no, no! Yes, yes. No es cierto! No, no, no, no... No, no, no! It's... You got it. You want your electricity fixed, move! Check into the fucking Plaza. Just give me my rent, lady. Look at my boy! How's he supposed to do his school work at night? By candlelight? Lincoln did! If he's got anything on the bloom, he'll grow up to be president! What the fuck do I know! Just gimme the rent! Mmm-mmm. Gimme the rent! Do you know what kind of droppings those are? Moose droppings. Rat droppings, Kritski. You really know your shit, don't you? What's the matter? You got no sense of humor? So what are you gonna do about it? Nothing. They pay their rent, they can stay! Neighbor! Neighbor? You're late with your rent, Marlon. I know, I know. Mommy's dying again, you had to send her money. How many times is it, this year, mamacita's almost croaked? Six. Six. Yeah, But, you know, I'm so glad she's still with us. Listen, why don't you insure the woman? When she decides to join that big pinata party in the sky, you can use the insurance money to pay your rent. Know what I mean? What is it with you Latins? Don't you have any pride? I got pride. I'm proud I live in a building. I'm proud I don't live inside of a cardboard box. Yeah. I have an address I can afford. I'm proud of that. Just gimme the rent. In my hand. Friday. Cash. Que pasa, Brother Gilliam? Oh, Jesus. Couldn't be better. Woke up this morning and found myself still among the living. Hallelujah! I'll see your "Hallelujah" and I'll raise you an "Amen." * Swing low, sweet chariot * I prayed for you last night, Mr. Kritski. * Coming forth, to carry me home * I prayed for you to get my commode fixed. Get outta my way, and leave me alone! You don't want me to leave you alone. Trust me, I do! No! Satan wants me to leave you alone. We both want you to leave me alone! Hallelujah! Ha! Finally, somebody who understands me. You must be Louis Kritski. Who wants to know? I'm Naomi Bensinger. Oh, yeah? Do you like this car, Naomi? This is my car. I'm counsel for the Housing Authority. Get off the car. Off the car! Beat it! I can't have a relationship with a woman who uses words like "counsel" and "authority," even if you are a good-looking broad. You know what I'm saying? Mr. Kritski. I have, in here, copies of dozens of violations on this building that you willfully ignored in an unconscionable fashion. I never said I was Kritski. You didn't have to. They did. You gonna listen to them, huh? They think we all look alike. If you're standing here alone, they would think you're Kritski. Now, look, look, look. Wait a minute. Wait a minute. Why don't we talk about this over lunch, huh, baby? Mr. Kritski, I don't wanna eat with you. I wanna prosecute you. See you in court. Bad choice for a first date. I'd like to eat with those chopsticks. WOMAN 1: Get outta here. WOMAN 2: Go to hell. WOMAN 3: Yeah. Help yourself to beans, Heather. Oh, no. I never eat anything green. All right. Heather, you gonna chew gum while you're eating? I forgot I had it in. I can't believe I've to go to court. I mean, I know you told me not to sweat this Housing Authority, but they keep sending violations that were piling up: electrical, plumbing, heating. Louie, you know how many violations get filed every year in New York City? Two million. Two million. You know how many convictions they get? Nada. Zip. Zero. Nada. Zip. Zero. Why? Because they got a bunch of morons in City Hall! Well, you didn't see this new lawyer they sent. This girl's really... I don't wanna hear about lawyers. But she's different... You know what I say about lawyers, BOTH: they bust your nuts wherever you're! I don't even know how many times they hauled me into court, forcing me to make repairs. Louie, what are three things you look for when you're looking for a piece of property? Death, divorce and destitution. What do you do when you got a piece of property? Nothing. That's it! Beautiful! He provides affordable housing for the underprivileged. BIG LOU: That's it. Perfect. Oh! Cool. Heather, can I ask you a question? How far did you go in school? Well, when I was in high school, I wouldn't even let a guy touch me. But, when I got to community college, I turned pretty wild. Oh! Anyway, you got nothing to worry tomorrow. The judge will probably give you a slap on the wrist or a small fine. What about the tenants? Will you stop about the tenants? But the tenants are gonna be there... Once they used to live in huts, they used to eat people. You feel better now? Come on, eat. Who gives a shit about a few whiny kookaboos? Therefore, I find the defendant, Louis Kritski, junior guilty of the charges brought before this court. Order! Order! Order! That's nice. JUDGE SMITH: Order! Now, accordingly, I will impose sentence at this time. Mr. Kritski, it's within my prerogative to sentence you to one year in the county jail. However, I'm not going to do that. In my opinion, threats of jail won't move you to bring your building into compliance. Therefore, I'm sentencing you to house arrest in one of the apartments of your own building for a period of 120 days, or until the building is brought up to code that's required by the state of New York. Your Honor, respectfully, I really think the maximum sentence is what's needed here. This city must send a message to slumlords that they can't continue... Miss Bensinger, I believe that this sentence will bring results. As counsel for the Housing Authority, I expect you to report any failure on Mr. Kritski's part to comply with the directives of this court. Now, according to the report I ordered, apartment 5C in your building is vacant, Mr. Kritski. And is listed by you as, "A furnished, fifth-floor charmer, with a view, "and close to shopping." MAN: What? You will move in immediately. You will reside there serving as the building superintendent. You will be allowed to leave only to purchase food, for medical emergencies, and for business related to the repair of the building. You may not renovate or alter apartment 5C to suit your needs, until the rest of the apartments in the building have been brought into compliance. Oh, boy. And, Mr. Kritski, one more thing. If that building isn't up to code in 120 days, you will go to jail. JUDGE SMITH: Court adjourned. You think you're a hotshot, don't you? You think you're gonna make yourself a name down at City Hall. You're not. You know, why? 'cause I'm getting a new lawyer, a white judge, and I'm gonna appeal! On what grounds? On the grounds that you piss me off. LOUIE: I thought you said this lawyer was the best. BIG LOU: He was the best in his price range. But don't worry. Things are gonna work out. I promise you. How could you make plans? Well, what about... No, I'm not going... Come on in. I'm not going anywhere. No, my father will have me outta there. I'm outta there. No way I'm going to that shithole. Who you talking to? Heather. Trying to figure out where we're going tonight. I'll tell you where you're going. You're going to the building to serve your time, or else you're going to jail! I gotta run. I'll talk to you later. Huh? Can't you do something? Louie, Louie, these things take time. You know what that place is like. Oh, so, you're giving up? Is this what I'm hearing? No, but I don't even wanna stay there one night, let alone have to live there. You know what this is? No. Well, look at it! It's your will. That's right. Who gets all my buildings? I do. Unless what? Unless you change your mind. Unless I change my mind. 27 buildings worth millions of dollars. You know what's gonna change my mind? If you fix one lousy wall in that building, if you change one light bulb, I'm gonna take you outta the will! I made myself clear, Louie? Yeah, Pop. All right, get up. Come on. Up! Now! Who are you? I'm a Kritski. You're goddamn right, you're a Kritski. And what does a Kritski do when he gets a piece of property? Nothing. Uh-huh! And what are you gonna do? I'm gonna go down there, and I'm not gonna fix anything. And I'll have those jerks eating outta my hand after one night. You're my boy. Wonderful. Wonderful. LOUIE: It's not so bad. Huh! You know what? This is gonna be okay. Jesus. So what. You know what? This is gonna be like camp. I'll watch TV, I'll sleep. I'll hang out with Heather. Heather's gotta come over. How bad could it be? I'll have Heather. How the hell am I gonna do this? For 27 buildings and millions of dollars, you can fucking do this! WOMAN: Don't you dare tell me... I don't believe this. MAN: You pig, pussy, pork bitch! WOMAN: Fuck, my mother told me we was poor 'cause we ate pork all our lives, I hate that shit! I didn't... You son of a bitch, now you... MAN: Bitch, I'll kick your ass, like you're a piece of beef! Fuck you! What the... Fuck it. At least it's a roof over my head. MAN: Keep it quiet up there, Kritski! Well, at least there's a motif. Wall-to-wall shit! Great! The rats have their own Jacuzzi! Now I know where they got the idea for the Roach Motel. Oh, God. Beautiful. A fucking sink that farts. WOMAN: Don't touch me! You're crazy. MAN: And you're a lying bitch! Who you calling a bitch, you ugly, one-eyed half-breed! God. What are you doing here? Nothing. What do you mean, "Nothing"? Well, what else does it mean? Nothing. What, are you spying on me? No. You casing this joint so the brothers could rob it later? You really got some real choice stuff here. We can't wait to get our hands on it. How come you're not in school, kid? It's Saturday. Yeah? Then why aren't you outside playing basketball or break dancing. Go ahead, get out. I'm going. Hey, hey, hey, hey. This is in, that's out. I'm taking a shortcut. Oh, hip stereo. Hey, don't touch it, will you, please? This is just a... It's an old thing. Sure. I'm not gonna rip you off. I'm not worried about you ripping me off. I just don't want you touching it. It's already broken. Probably don't even work. I know that. What do you mean, you know? I know it's not gonna work. Why wouldn't it work? Were you in here while I was sleeping... No. No! ...going through my stuff? You weren't going through... No! Did you touch this? No! What are you so nervous about? I'm not nervous! You're not... Oh, don't move. Don't move! Stay here. This better work. Better work. You're lucky. And it doesn't work because you never fixed the electrical in this building. I wasn't spying on you. I was just curious. I wanted to get to know more about you. Let me tell you something, okay? I'm not looking to make any friends. I don't think that's gonna be a big problem. Pain in the ass. What is it? What What? Kritski, looks like your automobile lost a little weight. MAN: He ain't figured it out yet. The alarm works! No tires, but the alarm works! Shit. You didn't see anything? You didn't see anything? You didn't hear that thing? The alarm didn't go off? You didn't hear that? No. Did you hear anything? I didn't hear anything, either. "I didn't hear anything, either." Did you... I know you didn't hear anything. MAN: Jose! Yo, white boy! What you doing down here, you white-assed motherfucker? What are you, the Welcome Wagon? LOUIE: Hey, nice outfits. Where's the rest of the band? Come on. No sense of humor? Get out! Get outta my way! Hey, where's the storekeeper? Where's the storekeeper, guys? Hey. Oh, what do I look like, a mirage? STOREKEEPER: Well, what the hell do you want? LOUIE: What do you mean, "What do I want?" I wanna get fitted for a tuxedo. Is this a grocery store, or what? You sell these groceries, or you guys got 'em for snacks? Well, what do you need? Let me see. I got my girl coming over. I need some wine. What kind of wine do you have here? Boy. You got... What the fuck is that? You expect me to drink screw You want a buzz? It's gonna have to come from this. Maybe I'll just get some essentials, so we don't starve to death. Holy shit! Your bread is older than your fucking wine. You get it? This is aged. This is... See, this should be aged. You don't... You get it? What a sense of humor! Am I on Candid Camera in this place, or what? I'll have peanut butter. Do you have any peanut butter? One kind only. "One kind only." Let me ask you a question. Why is it that you have 24 different kinds of pork rinds, and you only have one kind of peanut butter? Because we don't get too many fussy little white pricks in here. Okay. Want me to carry that bag? Hey, don't sneak up on me like that, Tito! I wasn't. Yes, you did. - I work here. You work where? Yeah, I beat out 70 other guys for this job. Get outta here. You were following me. Why'd you follow me? 'Cause I knew you were out of stale bread three-year-old peanut butter, and 50-cent wine. Get off my bag! Should I carry the bag or what? No, I don't want you carrying my bag. I don't need you to carry it or do anything for me. You know why? I ain't scared in this neighborhood. You know why I'm not scared? 'Cause I walk it like I talk it, kid. What's the matter with you? What do you mean, what's the matter with me? Nothing's wrong with me! Didn't you hear me yell, "Dive"? - I said, "Dive!" - Oh, come on. What do you mean, "Come on"? I did it 'cause you were here. - I was worried about you. - Oh, right. That was a gunshot. You could've got hit! TITO: You walking funny, man. Did you shit in your pants? LOUIE: No. You mean, that's the way you always walk? Yo, hey, Tito. How's it going, man? Hey. Who's that, your dealer? My father. - Yeah. Boy, your mother must like 'em young. My mother? Yeah, that lady you live with. She's my grandmother. I don't know where my mother is. How much they pay you on this job you have? - I work for tips. All right, take this. Run it up to the house. - There you go, there's a fin. - Thank you. "Thank you." That's it? That's $5 I gave you. Thank you, massa. Thank you, massa. Thank you... Fuck you, kid. Fuck you, too! Fuck me. Follow the bee. Follow the bee. Where's the bee? MAN 1: Wow, man. Buzzing bee, buzzing bee. Thank you for giving me the opportunity to have this little workshop here, while I go there and hit the big time, okay. Won't forget you when I hit the big time. Follow the bee. Where's the bee? MAN 2: I got that bee, man. Bees. It's just like lovemaking. Follow the bees. You're looking for the bee. You're looking for the bee. MAN 3: Yeah, there we go, man. I know where it's hidden. Come on, man. Which one is it? That's it... Man, you sure? MAN 4: That's it. I got it. Yeah! $40 got me $80, man. Hope you keep that smile when you lose. - Wait a second. - The rent money. Wait a minute. I'm fumbling all over here. This guy here beat me already. You're doing okay. Been watching you. - Give me the rent money. - I'm not doing okay. Hold on a second. I'll give all your rent money. You wanna play some rounds? LOUIE: I don't wanna play. Nobody wants to play for fun, anymore. Everything has to be for money. For money, you know? That's what ruined the Olympics. That's the bee. That's $20 minimum bet. Okay. Fine with me. Where's the money? - Right there. - Uh-huh! Oh, I'm so sorry. See what happens? You looking for the bee, man. That's where the honey is, you see? You got the king, you got the sting. Sorry. I was lucky. I was lucky. I don't know if I have the nerves for this. Lot of nerves in this game. Know what I'm saying? Hey, ain't you gonna gimme a chance to win my money back? What, are you crazy? No. $50 minimum bet, now. Okay. Okay. Where's your money? Excuse me. I'm hanging around. I might as well play. Enjoy myself a little bit. Okay, well, $60. I gotta take the highest bet. All right, $75. $100. $125. $150. $175. $200. First day on the job, and I hit it big. Thank you, Lord. You broke, big shot? Okay... Where's the money? It's me, Marlon. What do you mean, "Where's the money?" I gotta see the money. It's business. I wanna see it. You owe me the rent money. The guy lives in my building and wants to see the money. All right. Okay. Okay, so where is it? Where is it? Let me see, not sure. I think it's right... MARLON: Look at that! Like a small miracle. Where'd that guy go? Do you know that guy? You didn't know that guy? Now I got my rent money, huh? Know what this is? Yeah, I know what this is. Didn't I tell you I was gonna get the rent money? Yeah, you gave it to me, all right. Don't forget to give me a receipt. For my pride. Where were we? Where were we? Follow the bee. Follow the bee. Follow the bee. Hey! Heather! Heather! Heather! Heather! HEATHER: You sure this is it? Come here, baby! How you doing? They're a bunch of animals! Hold it right there, Mr. Superintendent! Outta the way, Leotha! This is an emergency! Not until you're gonna fix the boiler in the building. There's nothing wrong with it. - Yeah. All the way up to 40 degrees. I am freezing. Get a man. Up yours, Kritski! Good thing you're here. One more frigging day, I'd be ready for the funny farm with these people. Things are starting to change, though. That's it, honey. Climb the stairway to heaven. Louie, wait till we're in your apartment. Just trying to help you up the stairs. What do you mean? Ew! What is the smell in this building? It's smells like... Piss. Yeah, it smells like piss! What is that? It's piss. Drunks come in the hallway and they piss. You let them pee in here? It's not like they ask permission, know what I'm talking about? What? It was a rat! I saw a huge rat! I can't do it. I can't stay where there's rats. It's not a rat. You know, it's probably one of those Chihuahuas. They got those ugly-looking dogs, these tenants. You know, they look like rats. That's all it is. That's why the building is virtually rat-free. Weird. Here we're. I cleaned it up a little bit, the best I could. I can't get anybody to really, you know, come in and... HEATHER: Oh, my God! Make yourself comfortable. I'll be right there. I wanna get something for us to drink. Some wine I picked up. Come on, I'll take your coat. Be comfortable. Relax. You look tense. Relax. That's it. Come on. Now, we'll sit here first. Yes. I picked this up for us. What is that? Wine. They drink it in the neighborhood. It's really good. It's a little nasty, but you always liked nasty, didn't you? Louie, no! What? What's the matter? I don't know! It's just... Well, you know, I mean, I'm in prison here. This is my conjugal visit. Didn't I tell you on the phone? You knew the place was a dump! Big deal! What do you want me to do? Lie there, spread my legs, and try not to throw up, for as long as it takes you to get your rocks off? You were considering doing that? No! Louie. Come here. Just sit down. Give it a chance. Give the wine a shot. You know, loosen up a little bit. It's not that bad, see? It's pretty comfortable, right? Here, you take the first sip, okay? Oh, no, it's all right. Hey? What do you... It's okay. It's not bad. Is it the smell? It's this place, you know, it's... Hard to get in the mood. Yeah, well, you know, maybe... Wanna try the wine? Maybe some music, you know? Do you have anything soft and sexy? Luther Vandross, or Freddie Jackson. I love Freddie Jackson. Yeah, now you got it! Hey! This is... I love him. Oh, shit, I forgot. Wait, Heather! Heather, listen! Hold it, hold it! How about Johnny Mathis? Remember Johnny Mathis? *Look at me, I have... * Heather! Wait a minute! Heather, listen. I tried, Louie. I really tried. Seriously... Shut up! Go inside! Heather, I can... I can put Lysol on it! It won't work, Louie. Drive! Please drive! Speedy Gonzalez Kritski! Yo, baby! That was a quickie! Shut up! I hope you can fix my plumbing as fast as you fixed her. Maybe he needs his plumbing fixed! If that's the way white boys do it, I can see why they look so tense! Yeah, he had to work on the little lady, but he's got a very busy day. He got walls to plaster. He got pipes to change, and he got carpet to lay. Just keep on laughing. That's all right. Keep on laughing. 'Cause pretty soon I'll be outta here. I'll be downtown in my own apartment, laying in my Jacuzzi, just laughing about all you assholes stuck in this shithole! Get outta my way. Anger is the foothold of the devil. Fuck you and the devil! Eleanor! Eleanor! I already paid my rent. My toilet's stopped up. I gotta go to the bathroom. So? I gotta use your bathroom. No! What do you mean? How can you say no? It's easy. You should know that. It's the only word you know when I asked you to fix something. How much? I'll pay you. You don't have enough money. What do you expect me to do, shit outside? Lincoln did. Boy. It's on. NAOMI: Mr. Kritski! Mr. Kritski, we have to talk. Well, well, Miss Bensinger. What brings you to this hellhole in that tight skirt? Don't tell me, I know. Code violations, Mr. Kritski. The tenants have informed me you haven't addressed them. Can't stay away from me? Like moth to flame. Not even one as directed by the court. Like the swallows to Capistrano. And I can see, obviously, you have no intention of doing so. Oh, no? Check this out. I am currently supervising the rewiring of the entire building. Well, this is a big surprise, Mr. Kritski, I'm very encouraged. However, this is just the beginning of everything that's to be done. You got a great body, you know that? As a matter of fact, so do I. You can't tell with men's fashions, the way they fit nowadays. If you were to see me naked, you know what you would say? "Louie, I never would have guessed it, "but you got a great body there." MAN: Kritski! Listen here. The electrician. See? What you ask is impossible. I cannot just rewire your apartment. I didn't say, "Just my apartment." I didn't tell him, just my... I said, start with my apartment, and then, you know, do all the apartments. Oh, yeah? Go inside! Go do the apartment! What language? He doesn't understand. Don't let this guy throw you. I mean... Somewhere in here there's a list of all the other items the judge wants you to address. If you'll call my office with a timetable for your repairs, I'm sure some of the tenants would like to know. Did anyone ever tell you how attractive you are? No. Of course, they have! I'm 34 years old. You think no one's ever told me how attractive I am? You know what? Listen. This is a great opportunity for us to go up to my apartment. We can relax a little bit, get to know each other. Nothing fancy. If you think I'm such a jerk, how come you came here? Because you're attracted to me. Why don't you admit it? Like a magnet to a refrigerator. Look, I wanna see some real work begin on this building. I wanna see an agenda. I wanna see a construction crew. I wanna see something more than the Band-Aids you are currently applying to this open sore. And if I don't, you'll find yourself in prison, where your great body will be greatly appreciated. I don't know why you get so upset. Out! You have a terrible temper, but I still wanna take you to lunch! All right, forget the lunch! We'll just hump! Just a matter of time. Come on. Come on. I got money on this frigging game. Where'd that guy come from? Cut it... Will you... Maybe if I get a little higher. MAN ON TV: They're all on their feet. Way outside, trying for the three-pointer to win the game! It's in the air! Whoa! Whoa! And it's... What are you doing? What does it look like I'm doing? I'm watching television. Are you all right? Yeah. I'm great. Thanks. Oh, Jesus. You're not cold, are you? No, I just wanna see if these gloves work with the jacket, Marlon. That's all. What's it you want? What're you looking for? Nothing, man. I'm feeling good. Do you wanna come down with me and shoot some hoops? Hoops? Yeah, hoops. Basketball. You wanna play basketball with me? Yeah. Yeah. I'll bet you do. For money. Wanna hustle me? No, no money, man. Just for fun. For fun? Look, Marlon, why do you wanna play basketball with me? Why would you wanna play with me? Hey, you wanna come, I'll be downstairs. All right? Okay? Yeah, good. If you think I look stupid just say so, Marlon. I don't think you look stupid. Well, what are you looking at? Is it the jacket, the hood, what? It screams. You know what it says? It says, "Look at me. I'm wearing shit that nobody in this neighborhood would wear. "So come and stick me with the sharp object of your preference "and then steal that hideaway wallet I got Velcroed on my leg." You could tell? No, it doesn't show, but that's what you guys wear. Anyway, don't bother. You know, don't worry about it. It's okay. You're safe. You're with me. Yeah, like you're gonna protect me if I get attacked. I'll call 911 when they're done with you. Hey, Kritski! Where did you get that outfit? BOY 1: Gimme this ball. BOY 2: I got you. Yo. Hey, what's up? What's up man? Milkman, Louie. Louie, Milkman. Hey, what's going on, Louie?

Yeah, I bet you hate to bring it up. I'll give it to them. Good game! Good game! Good game, Louie. Yo, nice game, Kritski. Scrub. Hey, wait up. What the hell? Irene, what color was Louie's car? Son of a bitch! What the hell is this? What the hell is going on here? What's with the new lights? I can't believe it! Hey, sweetie! BIG LOU: I can't believe it! I can't believe he's done this! They need lights in the middle of the day? What's wrong with him? Look! Louie! Shit. Louie! Over here. Come over here. Over here. I wanna talk to you, Son. Didn't I tell you not to spend a penny? Did you fix those lights? Don't tell me you fixed the lights! Did you put new wiring in there? I had to. You had to I wanted to play my stereo. Well, now they can all play their stereos. Lights. I gave lights. It's just lights. Only lights? That's the inch. Now they want the mile! You give them shit! That's right, you give them shit! Shit! What are you hanging around these people for? Well, listen... You better get the upper hand around here, because this is gonna be home for a while. Your bail hearing took a dump. Yeah. Well, what did the judge say? What did he say? He said, "Eat shit and die, Mr. Kritski." That's what he said. Don't worry, honey. Daddy never gives up. He'll get you outta here. Look. Look at the throw pillows. I thought they'd add color to your apartment. Why don't I give it directly to the soul brothers? That's what he's gonna do, anyway. Here. Here you are. It's all yours, take it. Take it! Get in the car. Oh, goodbye, sweetie... Irene, get in the... Get in the car. Tell me how the cushions work. Get in the car. Get in the car. I'm getting in. Let's get outta here. All right. Louie, I'll talk to you later. What's the hurry? We just got here. Big Lou. When are you gonna get me outta here? As soon as Mom and I get back from the Bahamas. The Bahamas? The Bahamas? The Bahamas? * Everybody dance now * * Everybody dance now * * * * Give me the music * * Give me the music * * Everybody dance now * * Everybody dance now * * Yeah * * Yeah * * Yeah * * Everybody dance now * * Yeah * * Yeah * * Everybody dance now * * Give me the music * * Everybody dance now * * Everybody dance now * * Everybody dance now * * Yeah * * Yeah * * Yeah * * Yeah * * Everybody dance now * * Here is the dome back with the bass * * The jam is live in effect and I don't waste time * * Off the mic with a dope rhyme jump to the rhythm * * And I'm here to combine beats and lyrics * * To make you shake your pants * * Come on and dance, guys, grab a girl * * Don't wait make the twirl It's your world and I'm just a squirrel * * Trying to get a nut to move * * So you what's up, hands in the air, come on, say yeah * * Everybody over here everybody over there * * The crowd's live enough and I pursue this groove * * Party people in the house, move * * Now hit the dance floor * * It's gonna make you sweat till you bleed * * Is that dope enough indeed I paid the price to control dice * * I'm more precise to the point I'm nice * * Take control of your heart and soul * * Dance till you can't, dance till you can't dance no more * * Get on the floor and get raw * * Then come back and upside down, easy now * * Let me see you move * * Let your mind * * Move Put me online * * Baby * * Let the music take control * * Let the rhythm move you * * Sweat * * Sweat * * Let the music take control * * Let the rhythm move you * * Everybody dance now * WOMAN: Get dancing.

What do you want? I want you to get a cab and come over here. I'm really tired. My feet are killing me from the dancing. I gotta go. Shit! This life stinks! MAN: And then you die! I'm doubling your rent, meathead! Good. That makes two bad checks I have to write! Lower that music down there! I'm warning you people! This is the last... English! English! Doesn't anybody talk English? It worked before you broke it. Shut up! $1,700 What'd you do, use mahogany? Mr. Kritski, we didn't use nothing new. We just patched it up, like you said. Now if you'd sign right there, please. Big Lou's right. I'll go broke fixing things around here. $1,700 for a hole in the floor. Knock it off! Hey, Gilliam. Hey. No repairs unless authorized by me. Did you ever hear that? It's not a repair. It's more like a temporary blockade. Blockade of what? This place is infested with vermin. And thanks to you, we can now see where they're coming from. The rats will eventually chew through this, but it just might stop them for a night. I've been upstairs. I never saw one frigging rat. Not one! Maybe they're avoiding your floor out of professional courtesy. Anybody ever tell you you're a weirdo, Gilliam? Knock it off. They will come. Ooh! Go to bed, will you? Rats. Come on. MAN: The whole building's probably infested, you know. Yeah? There's gotta be something you could do just to keep 'em out of here. Well, you could try training 'em. That's very funny, pal. You do whatever you gotta do. Do the whole building. Shoot them, nuke them, burn them, I don't care. Fine. I'll go start upstairs. This is very gratifying, Mr. Kritski. I never would have believed it. Miss Bensinger, Miss Bensinger, you're just in time to see my agenda. I beg your pardon? Didn't you wanna see my agenda? Oh, of course. Where is it? Right here. I think the judge was looking for something a little bit bigger, Mr. Kritski. Women who are with me even once, never get over it. I can't help it. She wants me. Bad! It's finally happened. The boiler's dead! MAN 1: Stone fucking dead! We're freezing our asses here. Now, come out and do something about it. We'll break this door down if we have to. All right, all right. Obviously it's unusually cold in the building today. Not necessarily due to a malfunction of our boiler. That piece of shit is totally gone. You can't prove that. Proof? My parakeet is frozen solid. I could crack walnuts with him. I called every heating contractor in the city. They're all booked solid. It's winter. What should I do? Go out and kidnap one? Yeah. And drag him back here? Yeah. Well, I'm not gonna do it! If I can tough it out, so can you. How are we supposed to get warm? Burn one of your kids! What do I care! Get off that door. Big Lou's right about these shitheads. They wanna keep warm, why don't they dance? ELEANOR: You're no good, and I don't want you around here! EDDIE: Maybe you don't, but what about Tito? Get out, Eddie! I'm not leaving. I want you to take that bike and get outta here! Now, listen to me. Get out, just get out! You're acting crazy, Ma! TITO: Grandma! Get out! Just get out! I told you, Ma, you don't know what you're saying. TITO: Grandma! I know exactly what I'm saying. You're no good, and I don't want you around here! Yeah, well, maybe you don't, but what about Tito? He's my grandson and I don't want him to turn into a bum! Look, I bought this bike with my own money. It's dirty money, Eddie. Look, I earned it. You earned it. You earned it selling poison! Take this bike and get out! I'm sorry, Tito. You gotta take it out on the boy. TITO: Grandma, please! Come on. Eddie, take this bike and get outta here! No, Tito! Tito! Hey, Tito. Wait up. Tito, wait up. All right, Tito. What's the problem? I'm pissed off, that's all. What, the bike? I saw the bike. I could understand that. Oh, yeah, right. Like you know. Well, yeah, I know. I mean, I can understand. Listen, let me try to explain something to you. Your grandmother did the right thing. See, she couldn't let you keep that bike, because if she let you keep that bike, it's like saying whatever your father did to get the money to buy the bike, is okay. Understand? And she can't do that, because, well, what your father does... He does bad things. So do you. Well, I mean, it might look like that to you, 'cause you're a little kid, but... I mean, there's a big difference between your father and me. Yeah For one thing, I don't make a living off other's misery. You don't? No, I'm a businessman. You're a slumlord. I'm not a slumlord. Great. Order up some room service, then. All right, so maybe it ain't the Plaza. It's a garbage dump. Why don't you get lost, huh, Tito? ELEANOR: Tito, you up there? Yeah, I'm up here. Well, you come down here and do your homework, right now! I'm coming. You know, if you think about it, we sorta have the same problem. You know, if you fix this place up, you might actually make people happy. Maybe even yourself. But your daddy wouldn't like that, and you're too chicken to take that risk. Aren't you, Kritski? MAN 1: Thank you, Mr. Kritski. Good, good, good. MAN 2: All right. Here you go, Reverend. Are you gonna give the Reverend one, too? Eleanor. Eleanor. Give me one. Oh, God bless you. Hey, hey. What is this? TITO: Kritski, where's mine? You're selling these to the tenants? No, I'm not selling them. Tito, put that down. Leotha, take over. I'm giving every one of the tenants one of these. That's why I wanted you to come by and witness this. You could pass the word onto Judge Stoneface. The heaters are a good start. Understanding. If you hadn't run the building into the ground this wouldn't even be necessary. I'm taking care of the problem. Well, it's more of a gesture, not a solution. Look, I'm not looking for the medal of honor, okay? It would be nice if, for once, you could acknowledge I'm not a total jerk. Is that hard? Well, you're not. And it is nice. It is, isn't it? All right, let me finish. LOUIE: Get in line. You can't just take it. Wait a minute, wait a minute. LOUIE: Wait, wait. Hey! Hey, get away from there! Put that stuff down. Put that stuff down, I said! Get that... What do you think you're doing? The boiler broke, so I had to... What are you, an expert on boilers now, huh? It's broken when a qualified technician says it is. I'll send over a qualified technician. Well, we're freezing inside. "We" How many times I have to tell you? It's us and them. You think I wouldn't find out about this? No... You used the company credit card. They called for authorization. That crap belongs to me. I want it on the truck, now! Mr. Kritski, you're interfering with Mr. Kritski's compliance with a court order. I know what the court order says, "Within 120 days." A lot can happen in 120 days. Like spring. You don't need heat in spring, Counselor. Let me explain something to you, Son. You fix this place up on Monday, Friday it's back to where it was. I know. You fix the plumbing, they put chicken bones down the toilet. Put in heat, they piss in the hot-air ducts. You fix one shitty toilet, I'll disown you. One toilet, you're outta the will. Gimme that, Buckwheat. Who you calling Buckwheat, you fat fuck? You little shit, you... Come on, Pop, let him have it. It's mine. It's his. I paid for them. I'll pay for everything then, okay? I'll pay for it. I'm gonna put in a new boiler, too. If you can't get someone to come down here and do it, then I'll find somebody to put it in. Can't you just let me handle this myself? Let me do this, huh? Please, Pop, go home. They've brainwashed you, like Patty Hearst. What's next? You're gonna bring 'em to Disneyworld? Pop. Don't call me Pop. I don't recognize you anymore. You're not my son! You're breaking my heart! See you, Louie. Come on. You gotta carry these things if you want 'em. I can't... WOMAN 1: Wait, wait, wait. Careful with them. WOMAN 2: Hey, thanks. This is great. I know that must have been a hard thing for you to do. You wanna come up to my apartment and keep me warm? Nothing weird, first time. You know, man on top. You don't need me. I think you're hot enough for the both of us. Damn. * You can't touch this * My, my, my, my music hits me so hard * Makes me say, oh, my lord, thank you for blessing me * With a mind to rhyme and two hyped feet * Feels good when you know you're down * A superdope homeboy from the Oaktown * And I'm known as such * And this is a beat * You can't touch this * I told you, homeboy You can't touch this * Yeah, that's how we livin' and you know * You can't touch this * Look in my eyes, man * You can't touch this * Yo, let me bust the funky lyrics * Fresh new kicks and pants * You got it like that, now you know * you wanna dance So move out of your seat * And get a fly girl and catch this beat * While it's rolling Hold on * Pump a little bit and let 'em know it's going on * Like that Like that * Cold on a mission so pull on back * Let 'em know that you're too much * And this is a beat they can't touch * Yo!

It's Marlon. Well, what do you want? You got a key. Come in. In case you haven't heard, there's a party going on. Huh? I said, there's a party going on. Oh, yeah. Yeah, well, I hear music, but I didn't know. I think you should come, otherwise you're gonna look like an antisocial or something. I'm in the middle of this puzzle. I love to do these, you know. And I have... I have a couple of other things I have to do. I'm busy, you know. So, maybe later. I don't know. I'm not... You know, I don't like dancing and stuff, so... Maybe later. Thanks. Okay. * Yeah, you can't touch this * You can't touch this * You can't touch this * My, my, my, my music hits me so hard * Makes me say, oh, my lord, thank you for blessing me * With a mind to rhyme and two hyped feet * Feels good when you know you're down * A superdope homeboy from the Oaktown * And I'm known as such And this is a beat * You can't touch this * I told you, homeboy You can't touch this * Yeah, that's how we livin' and you know * You can't touch this Hey. * You can't touch this * Yo, let me bust the funky lyrics * Fresh new kicks and pants * You got it like that, you know you wanna dance * So move out of your seat And get a fly girl and catch this beat * While it's rolling Hold on * Pump a little bit and let 'em know it's going on like that * Like that Cold on a mission so pull on back... Hello? LOUIE: Yo, Bensinger. Kritski? Yeah. I just thought I'd call you, see how you're doing. Where are you? I'm having trouble hearing you. I'm at a party. It's with some of the brothers, you know. Getting down with our nasty selves. Did I hear you say a party? Yeah. Mr. Kritski, you know you're not supposed to leave the building. Who left the building? What are you talking about? I'm downstairs with some of my neighbors. Really? Yeah. Well, that's very uplifting, Mr. Kritski. Does this mean you finally realize you have to bring the building up to code? Well, yeah. You know, I mean, this is how things start, right? The first nail. The first toggle bolt. The first, ahem, screw. Most things. Yeah. Look, Miss Bensinger, I don't want to promise you any miracles or anything, but I had some great ideas, you know, and I thought maybe you would like to come over and check 'em out. Kritski, are you asking me to come over to your place? Well, yeah. I mean you're supposed to check up on me anyway, right? If you want me to come over and see you, why don't you just ask me? All right, come on over and see me. Can't do it. I was in court all day. I didn't even make it into the office. I'm beat. All right, I'll call you another time. Good night. Bye, Louie. Louie Louie? Watch out! Here I come! Louie's coming back. * You can't touch this * Look in my eyes, man * You can't touch this * Yo, let me bust the funky lyrics * Fresh new kicks and pants * You got it like that, now you know you wanna dance * So move out of your seat * And get a fly girl and catch this beat * BIG LOU: Louie? Louie? God damn it. What the... Pop? Louie. Pop? It's me. Louie. You all right? Yeah, yeah. What's the matter? No, nothing, nothing. No, I'm fine. Look, I got good news for you. You're out on bail. You're kidding? No, no, I'm not kidding. Come on, pack up all your stuff and let's go. Come on, let's go. This is great. Well, don't stand there like a statue. You're home. Let's go. All right? Well, wait here. Are you kidding? No, hurry up. All right, I'll be right down. I'll wait for you downstairs. All right. Hurry up, Louie. LOUIE: Oh, shit. Oh, boy. Well, well, well. And where is the Prince of Whiteness sneaking off to? I'm outta here, Leotha. What? That's it, I'm sprung. I'm going back to civilization. I'm going home. Hey, Leotha! Yeah. Check this out. James Brown, move over. Hey. Do me a favor. Yeah. Tell the kid I said goodbye. Okay. I will. Louie, come on! Hurry! Let's get outta here. Let's go. What are we, in a race?

I went to see the Bensinger woman. You went to see Naomi? Yeah. I told her, you take on Big Lou, you're in trouble. She got the message. You went to the office? Yeah. Today? Yeah. What're you doing? Get your foot off the brake. All right, what's going on? What? what are you doing? What's going on? Naomi wasn't at her office all day. Look, you're not involved. It's just the roof. It's not gonna be a big fire. Jesus, Pop. A fire? Louie, come on. Oh, there's people in there. It doesn't take much to condemn a building! People. What's wrong with you? Louie, come back! Louie! It'll just be the roof! The city will close the building, and you can come home! Louie! Louie, listen to me! Louie, come back here. Louie, come here! Louie! Louie, don't go in there. Louie, I didn't know what to do. Come back here. Louie! Louie, listen. Louie, don't run away. Louie, listen to me. Louie, come here, will you? Louie! Louie! Hey, put that shit down. Put it down. Fuck you. No, fuck you, there's not gonna be a fire. So you're Junior. Well, Junior, your old man over there paid me a lot of money to light this place up. And that's what I'm gonna do. No. Nobody's burning my building, you understand? You understand? Nobody is gonna burn my building. I'm not an arsonist and neither are you. You. Get off my roof before there's trouble. There's already trouble. I'll throw you right the fuck off this roof. Yeah. You and who else? MARLON: Me. Me, too. Me, too, shithead. What do you wanna do? I already got my money. And I'm keeping it. You don't understand. I got scared. I didn't wanna lose you to these... These, these... What? They're people, go ahead, look at them. Human beings, not animals, Pop. You don't burn somebody outta their home just because everything's not going your way. You gave me this building. It's mine, remember? I'm gonna run it the way I think it should be run. Shit. Pop. Pop, wait. Pop, wait. I'm getting outta here. Wait, Pop. Pop, wait. Wait, wait. Just wait. Listen. You can't do that. Don't you understand, huh? Don't you understand? There's kids up there. People live here. I mean, anything could happen. Those things get out of control. I don't want my father to do that. I didn't mean to embarrass you upstairs, but I didn't know what to do. What do you expect me to do? You just don't stop. Louie. If you need me... Thanks, Pop. Feels good, don't it? What? Being your own man. Let's go. We got a lot of things to do up there. WOMAN 1: Would you believe I actually had to turn the heat down last night? WOMAN 2: This place hasn't been painted since I moved in. The little son of a gun actually painted the hallway. WOMAN 3: Fresh paint, new curtains, I can't believe it. WOMAN 4: Yeah. My oven's working. WOMAN 5: Oh, girl, my cousin's moving in next week. Hey, look at this, man. They all came to say goodbye. Yeah, Marlon, I'm sure it's breaking their hearts. Hey, Tito. About that bike... Hey, don't worry, Kritski. I'm not gonna tell anybody you bought me the bike. Hey, look, how nice. You all got together. You should do this every month. This way I can get my rent all at once. We all just wanna make sure you're leaving. I have just one thing to say. I wanna say one thing, too. Let's keep it short and sweet. Goodbye. My sink is broken. It's not my problem anymore. You have to give those problems to your new super. Oh! Marlon, hey! MAN 1: All right. All right. Come on, I gotta go. I don't fucking believe it! My car! Marlon, you shouldn't have. Marlon. Boy, wow. I can't believe it. It's a miracle. Where'd you get all the original parts and everything? Well, I guess when you put your mind into something... LOUIE: I mean, you know, everybody's been so nice, giving my car back, I'm almost sad to leave. Oh, yeah, right. MAN 2: Sure you are.
