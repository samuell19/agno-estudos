Sorry! Hello. - Am I late? - We said... I hate being late, but I had to buy flowers before they closed... for a... Sorry. Would you like something to drink? I have red berry juice. Yes, please. Damn, it's all gone. Tea, if you're not too hot? No, it's alright. Here's the alarm. You'll manage to install it? You can stick it to the ceiling with the adhesive patch. Thank you. I don't smoke, but it's reassuring. The gas stove is dangerous. I started a fire once. - Really? - As a child, at home. Is this a good spot? I think it is. I put hot incense ashes in a wicker basket. These huge flames burned the carpet and curtains, even the wooden desk my dad made. Sorry, sit on the table if you like. The couch was Raoul's. He took it when he left. Just a second. Use this if you prefer. Look, Anaïs, I didn't just come to bring the alarm. I wanted a word with you. I see. About the rent? Yes, you owe two months, March and April. You moved in this winter. You must realize... I know, I'm really sorry, ma'am. I promise I'll pay. I'm not a thief. I'll find a way. Watch out! Sorry. I didn't expect to live here alone. We were going to share the rent. It's all my fault. I couldn't take marital life. I mean as a couple, it's too tough. Don't you agree? 8:15 already? Do you mind if I change? Actually, Raoul and I haven't really parted. We just don't live together now. How do you manage? I mean, after centuries with your husband? Your apartment must be big. Very big even. It helps. Do you think I have a problem? That I don't know how to love? If I was in love, really in love, I'd be happy to see the other person every day, morning, noon and night, to sleep with them, well, him. That's normal, right? You're happy to sleep in a person's bed? There's no "normal". We do what we can with what we are. For instance, do you love your husband? Sorry. How will you manage for the rent? I can give you a little time, but... debt is a vicious circle. I'll be getting money from welfare soon and I may have found work to pay the bills with my thesis supervisor. I'll manage, I swear. Why not get a smaller, cheaper place? I can't. Without a salary, it's impossible in Paris. Here, it's cos your son knows Raoul. I really have to go. I'm off. Sorry. You can stay. Slam the door behind you. Thank you for everything. It's adorable of you. I nearly forgot. Goodbye! Goodbye. ANAÏS IN LOVE Sixteenth? Shit... - Hello. - Evening. - Going to Patrick and Laure's? - No, the basement. Drat. I'm going to the sixteenth floor, but I can't go alone. I get claustrophobia, so I'll take the lift with you. - Can you take me to... - No. I'm late, see. - Good evening. - Hello. - Going to the basement? - No. - Which floor? - Sixteen. - Wonderful. - Why? Me too, but I'm not keen on lifts. - Too cramped? - Yes. Can we go together? Of course. - Going to Patrick and Laure's? - Yes. I can't walk up with my bicycle. I lost my lock or someone stole it. Weird, stealing a bike lock. It's mysterious. Hold this for me. I'll do it. We'll simply put it upright. - There. - Thank you. I'll see you up there. I'll take the stairs. Sixteen floors on foot? I love walking. We're already late. I'll hurry. I'm not ostracizing you. What are those fancy words? I'm just saying... No, not next week. Emilie will be there all the time. I can't talk now. I'll call you tomorrow. Take care. Take care. Ready? Shall we go? Hold on a second. What is it? That one too. Never mind. Daniel Moreau-Babin. Anaïs. Is everything alright? Yes. Actually, no, not at all. I woke an annoying old knee wound. Cruciate ligaments? No, inflammation of the iliotibial band. It's no fun. I believe you. Athletes often get it. I do if I climb too fast without warming up. On a mountain hike, say. If I don't stretch, my knee blocks and I can't move it for days. Do you hike a lot? Yes, I love it. - You too? - Never. But the woman I live with loves it. I need to find the bathroom. It hurts too much. Know where it is? I presume... Was that your mistress earlier? I mean, when you said... "Impossible, Emilie will be there." It was my son, back from Lebanon. He wanted to stay over, but Emilie, my partner, prefers to avoid cohabitation. - You know... - I'm Balthazar's sister. Rebecca's boyfriend. Patrick and Laure's daughter. Ok, I see. I'm Rebecca's friend too. I met her first, at university. Now, they're getting married. - Which course? - Hypokhâgne. - Been here before? - No. Odd, leaving the big house for a tower block. They'd been in the suburbs thirty years. Well, probably, with the kids gone, the house was too big. A house is never too big. My bicycle did that! Damn. You just added oil to it. I'm sorry. Forgive me. Slow down, we missed it. There's 20 minutes of ads. They started 25 minutes ago. Come on. No, not if the film's started. Raoul, I really wanted to see it. Me too, and I was on time. You wanted to see it with me. Sorry, a guy was telling me something fishy. Let's walk to my place. He said Mme de Lafayette wrote to Mme de Sévigné. I doubt it. I think he meant Mme de Sablé. He said the tone was really tender. He was implying she was in love. What an imagination. Back then, an eight-year age difference was like a generation. I think he's a joker. By the way, I'm pregnant. Not for long, I'll... - Are you joking? - What? I had no time to tell you. I saw a gynaecologist... How did it happen? I don't know. I'm unlucky. I guess I forgot my pill for ten days in Auvergne, and I got pregnant. I must be hyper-fertile. It sucks. I'm already up to seven weeks so I need a sort of op. Vacuum extraction they call it. Do I do it in Paris or see my parents' gynaecologist friend? She could... What's wrong? You want a child? You don't realize what human interaction is. A relationship. Meaning? You never once thought you should tell me? I'm telling you. Stop, Anaïs. You made your decision alone. You know I don't want children. I don't know why we're together anymore. How selfish can you get? You live your life, you see me when you have time. You advance like a bulldozer. I'm a big tractor, you told me. Want to fight? See, you're violent. No, I'm not... You are. Look at your phone later! Don't tell me what to do, you despot. You're violent too in your inertia and your nonchalance. I won't discuss this now. "I won't"... Shut the hell up! Who is it? A guy I met at Rebecca's parents'. His name's Daniel. He's charmed and wants to see me again. An old guy. Back to your former ways. Not my type. You gave him your number. He must've asked Rebecca's mum. I didn't give it. He signs "DMB". His initials. Weird. Aren't you scared an abortion will make you sterile? I mean, isn't that a risk? Are you crazy? This isn't the 19th century. I don't want children. I love you. Another mood swing. You get on my nerves. I wouldn't mind a tiny Anaïs. - Sorry. - It's ok. This doesn't usually happen. I feel intimidated. It's my fault? I didn't do anything. I've never had an affair with a young woman. Much younger than me. Do you often cheat on Emilie? I don't cheat on her. Really, I don't. In twelve years, this is the first time. You don't believe me? No. So what does this mean? You don't love her anymore? When I really love someone, I don't notice others. That sounds dumb and totally naive, but that's how it is. It's not at all a moral thing. I don't have principles. I've cheated too. But on people... guys I didn't really love. I like you. I really like you. My first wife, my son's mother, I spent twelve years with her. Then I met Emilie. It's been twelve years now. And I meet you. It feels like it's inevitable. A cycle. Where does she think you are? Nowhere. She's at her country place. She has a country place? Yes. My dream. She writes there. She's a writer. - She goes alone? - Yes. Maybe with lovers. Come here. - What's that? - Hold on. Don't break it. There's a button. Pass me a book. You favour a light touch. By the way, I forgot to say... Is it ok if we don't sleep together? The thing is... sleeping with people stresses me. You're throwing me out? Sort of. It's not personal. - Are you ok? - Yes. You look beautiful. Your hair's so long. I'm so glad to see you. Me too. The train was on time for once. It was packed. It was hell. I didn't think you'd pick me up. Aren't you working? No. I'm on holiday. They're renovating the pool? Yes, I think so. No, they're demolishing it. It's going to be a tourist residence. I learned to swim there. They demolish everything. Come on, you're never here. You hadn't been to the pool since you were five. True... But I liked it being there. Can we go via the sea? You've had that dress ages. I got it for my 17th birthday. - You're not sick of it? - No, I love it. You wear it year-round. Want to go shopping later? I can't be bothered. I finally read that book you gave me. Which one? Lol Stein? And? My daughter! You smell of cheese. Ok? Life isn't too tough? - Let me see. - What? Grey hairs. Someone said I look ten years younger than I am. They thought I was 50. - Who's "they"? - A client. - Pretty? - Hot as usual. A babe. I gave her my number. Gotta go, I'm late. Where? Her place for a drink to get acquainted. I'm seeing the notary. I need my chequebook. See you later. What did you think of the book? I didn't understand it all. You didn't like it? It's not that, it's... What did you find so brilliant? I need you to explain. I don't know... The writing, the atmosphere... I won't give you a lecture. You either like it or not. It's that simple. It's ok, we don't have to like the same books. The sun's strong. I'll get a hat. Want one? No, thank you. What's this? Are you having a relapse? Why didn't you say? I didn't want to tell you over the phone. We've been here an hour. There's no rush. It was nice here. And Dad acts like nothing's wrong. What is it? Liver metastasis. I'm sorry. I'm sorry, it's just that... I know, honey. I thought you were safe after seven years. Seven and a half years. Nothing's ever final. You said there was only a 5% risk. It was only 5%. Shit, I don't believe it. What'll happen now? They'll try chemo. If I can take it, it'll keep the tumours at bay for a long time. It can become chronic rather than fatal. It can lie dormant, like AIDS. That's great! Yes... I mean... Let's change the subject. What were you watching? Serial killers don't freak you out? It relaxes me. You're too much. Raoul loves them too. I don't get it. Your brother said you met Rebecca's dad's publisher. Yeah. DMB. You've woken me. C'mon, Grandpa. Couldn't he find you a job? You'd meet interesting people in publishing. I don't want to meet interesting people, I want to be interesting. Good, my girl. I have to finish my thesis. Let me sleep now. Why don't you use the next room? You have three free bedrooms. Why do you stay stuck to Mum? Ok, I get it, I'm being evicted from my own bedroom. Fine, as you never see your mum. Turn around, I'm naked. Good night. Good night. I transferred you May's rent. Hasn't it come through? I'll call you back. My op's about to begin. I'll call you as soon as I wake. Goodbye. - Thank you so much. - You're welcome. I didn't know you played golf. I can't play tennis now. - Are Marion and Robin still in Moscow? - Yes. Why? Think they have Russian friends who'd live in my place? Who'd sublet it? I'll ask them. How did you find your mother? It won't be easy. A recurrence at her age. She knows it's bad. She's brave, but she's scared. The first time was ok. She took it well. She didn't realize. This time, she's worried. I think the idea of more chemo is too much for her. You'll need to be here. No general anaesthetic? Yes. And you're sure about... Totally sure? Yes. A few weeks later Here we are. Cool. I hate that personally. It caused me and Raoul to split up. I wonder why I left him. Well, he left me. He's great, smart, funny. He really loved me. Now I'm with a married guy as old as my dad. I have a really big problem, huh? I expected passion with the old guy, that he'd be mad about me. I don't think he's into passion. Or maybe he doesn't have time. Yes, that's true. Wow... It weighs a ton. What's in here? My books, so I can work. Ok, we're here. Emilie won't be back unexpectedly? She's in the Alps till Tuesday. The Alps? Shall I fetch you towels? No, it's ok, I have things. I'll change. You're beautiful. I'm glad to see you. My place is the size of your hallway. My little Cosette... You're trembling. Come on, I'll make some tea. Ok. - Green tea? - Yes. Is that Emilie? Yes. Did you take it? Yes. Sugar? Yes... No, thank you. Excuse me. Yes, Vanessa. Yes, I tried calling you. Delaunay hasn't had Selznick's book. He's on the Renaudot Prize jury. Yes, Delaunay. Get a copy to him first thing. Let's not upset him. His vote could be important for us. For the essay prize. We haven't won anything for years, so it would do us a lot of good. I bet it didn't suit you. You were right to quit. I bet you smoked daintily, too elegantly, not sloppily enough. Delicious strawberries. What I love is a guy hiding his face when he smokes. Like this, see. It's so sexy, Gainsbourg style. Says a girl who can't light a cigarette. Ok, but... - I can have an opinion. - Sure. - Been here long? - Eight years. That's all? Come on. What's this? I don't understand. You want us to fuck in your son's bed? No, but... Sorry, I'm uneasy. Maybe we shouldn't have... It bothers you, me being here? Listen... Do you want me in your life or not? You're wonderful, beautiful, smart, funny... And? But I love my life. I don't want to change it. You're so much younger, it's not possible. Everything is possible if you want it. I can't want that. And you'd leave me... You want Emilie and me too? Isn't that some crap bourgeois cliché? The lawful wife and the young mistress? That's ok regarding Emilie? I don't know what she gets up to at book fairs or her country place. What? Forgive me. The twelve-year thing was a pick-up line? What? The cycles. Your first wife, Emilie, then me. Sorry, I thought we were living the same thing. You must decide to fall in love. Stop, this is insulting. Not at all. If you're scared, I'm not interested. I like people who know what they want. Why didn't you pick up? I thought you were away. What are those bags? I left DMB. The guy's a wimp. He prefers his slut of a wife to me. I'm scared. Gilbert's dying. What? He's in a semi-coma on the carpet. What can I do? Rebecca couldn't take him on her Swiss tour. I know. I'm responsible. She'll kill me. Look. - He's asleep. - No. He is. It's midnight. He's asleep like anyone. He's totally inert. Leave the poor monkey be. He's drooling everywhere. Doesn't this work? - I gave him Xanax. - What? It's dumb, I know, but he was going crazy. - Uncontrollable. - You drugged Gilbert? Stop it. He's not as tough as us, he could OD. I fucking know. Call the emergency doctor. Or the emergency vet. - Let's put him on the couch. - No, Balthazar. What? That's disgusting. Please, come on. I can't, it disgusts me. All that fur. Girl, grow up! Grab his paws. Gently. Poor Gilbouze. Should I go back to Raoul? Think I can't love? It's good you're here. You can watch him. Yes, sleep next to him. I'll fetch a blanket. I think you're right in a way. I always knew I'd write books, I'd leave the provincial world in which I grew up. I knew my life would differ from my parents'. I wanted... intensity. I still want intensity. Between 25 and 30, I was a radio station archivist. It was interesting, but I felt frustrated. I wanted fulfilment and I knew that it had to be through writing. It took time before I dared to... - how can I put it? - dared to follow my desire. I could have written it all. If I was a writer. I think the same way she does. We share a vision, personality, tastes. It's astounding. What? Who? Emilie, DMB's wife. He picked the same woman 20 years younger. Look. Isn't she beautiful? You're going crazy. Listen, "Happiness owes nothing to circumstance. It's a state that makes us want to live and desire's power determines our happiness, despite circumstances, with or without them." Shit, it's Rebecca. Answer! Don't act odd! Yes? Yes, fine. And you? No, nothing special. Yes. No, I'm not weird. - The monkey Gilbert? - Yes. No, well, yes. He's a lemur. It's just a cold. I'll call you back. I'll wait here for you. It's always chaos here. They didn't want the secretary on site, now, for some reason, they don't want you in Ms Langlois's office on the third floor. Hello. We'll put you in the Research building. I'm grateful. It's temporary. Marianne will be back after her maternity leave. When can I read the second part of your thesis? It was due at the end of May. Yes, actually, I... - Sorry... - Anaïs! I'll catch up. Hello. - Are you Emilie Ducret? - Yes. What a coincidence! I'm reading one of your books. Boldness. I'm loving it. I love your style. It's dazzling. We seem close emotionally. I'm glad you're touched by it. Sorry, I'm seeing my publisher. Yes, of course. It's funny because I know Daniel. Really? Through mutual friends. I met him at the Vidals. You're very beautiful. So are you. I really have to go. What's your name? Anaïs. See you soon, maybe, Anaïs. Yes. The Rouen symposium is a priority. It's next week and it's the big event for our lab. It's two years of work, with international academics... It's crazy. That woman I met just now, I dreamed of meeting her. Is that a sign? It's all in Marianne Langlois's files. Flight and train reservations, hotel bookings... And it's not her neighbourhood. There was little probability of us meeting there. Anaïs, are you with me? Yes, sorry. You have to coordinate timetables and programme each day down to the minute. And we'll need you there in Rouen for the six days. We'll discuss that at tomorrow's meeting, 9 AM in room 614. I'll leave you to settle in. Ok. May I ask you something? If you said to a man, to a young man, "You're very beautiful", what would that mean? I'd never say that to a young man. I happen to have written novels, essays and stories. I've even written essays in the first person. So, yes, if you like, I'm hard to classify. Well, my literary work is. And, to be honest, I'm happy to... I'm happy to know... well, to feel such liberty in my writing, to be able to move from one form to another, according to my desire. But, careful, that desire goes hand in hand, I feel, with a necessity closely linked to the subject that I tackle. You, Axel, have gone from journalism to literature, but your material remains reality, raw reality. Hello, I'm Anaïs. Yes... I wrote to you last week. We met in Paris, near your publisher's. Yes, Anaïs. It's you. But... I came here to see you. Alright. You find that odd? You arrived last night, didn't you? Yes. You need to pay in advance, miss. - Come with me. - Right now? Yes, I'm a busy woman. Well... See you later. Yes. How many nights? All five. Seven fives are 35. 350 euros. That's... In cash? No, Visa. Yoann, come here a minute. There's no 6 PM train. Pick the Brits up at 8 PM. You'll have time to repaint the stable shutters. Payment denied. A cheque? It's 70 euros a night? With full board, remember. There's no reduction if you stay... This isn't AirnB. No, it's not "AirnB" Hold on, Odile. She could help out to pay for her room. You can do odd jobs? Yes. You're not too fussy? No, not at all. Ok then, pay two nights and see Yoann about the rest. Alright. He knows what needs doing here. I was looking for you. Would you like to go for a walk? Alright. I wasn't making much progress. Before, I could work anywhere. Now, I need my table, my house... I hate the idea of... being dependent on a place. It makes me angry. What are you writing about? You're indiscreet. Sorry. I'm teasing you. I'm working on The Knight of the Rose. Do you know Strauss's opera? It has a fine libretto by Hofmannsthal and I've been asked to adapt it for the stage. It's just to pay the bills. I needed money, so I accepted. - Do you have a book project? - Yes. An essay on curiosity, actually. But it's on hold. I gave my publisher 50 pages and he found it heavy going. He's scared it won't sell. They're all scared now. The man I live with too. He's a publisher... Hold on... Didn't you say you knew Daniel? Yes. Not well. I said that the other day thinking it would make me... more familiar to you, but I only met him once. Yes. Who are you, Anaïs? Where did you spring from? I'm finishing a thesis on 17th-century descriptions of passion. I don't know what I'll do after. I don't want to teach. Shit! - Hide! - What is it? It's Yoann. And? Is that him? No, my thesis supervisor. I was arranging a symposium and left without warning. You skipped a symposium for a symposium? You'll get fired. Oh, wild apples! What do you want from me? Nothing. I just wanted to know you. I think we could get along. I think we're alike. Very tasty. There you are! We have work to do. Get in. I have to help a little. More than a little. Do you need a ride? No, I'll walk back. I work here in summer to make money, but in fact I'm a playwright. I'm directing a play in September, something I wrote about the extinction of capitalism, the return of socialist and humanist values. They say this is the age of the individual, but the collective is back in force. I questioned lots of people for my play. Ivy smells so nice. What're you doing? You're ruining the jasmine. Isn't jasmine white? When it's in bloom. Let me do it. How did you end up in Kerduel? Through my father, three years ago. He mentioned me to a guy in Brest who mentioned me to Odile. And, just after, he died. Your father? Yes. Cancer. It was over in six months. Did he suffer? You bet. Mum, I feel stupid tonight. Stupid, guilty and sad. I'm sad thinking of you and what you're going through. Sad for not being there. Hardship scares me and that makes me selfish. Sorry, Mum. I try to protect myself. I had a strange intuition the other day. I thought that if you'd had a passion in life, you might not have fallen ill again. Or if you and Dad really loved each other. I don't know. That's what I think. Good evening. - Are you ok? - Yes. Are you sure? No, but... Going for a walk? No. I've lost a book. A book I'm fond of. I hope I forgot it in the meeting room. I'll go and see. Good night. Good night. Can you pass me that pot, please? You missed that bit. Yann, excuse me. I can see you're busy, but... It's Yoann. Sorry, Yoann. The printer's out of paper. What can I do? He can't understand! I need to read my translation. - I'm busy here. - I'll help you. Know where we keep the paper? No, but you'll tell me. This must be Odile's room. Look, a photo with Robbe-Grillet. She was already crabby at 16. Did you find your book? No, I'm upset. What was it? It's an old story. I was at school, aged 14. I adored my French teacher. Ms Garcia was her name. I often think I became a writer thanks to her. She thought my school essays were wonderful. She showered me with books, on top of the class ones. I had a crush on her. The way you do at that age. Anyhow, Ms Garcia loved Duras. And she had lent me The Ravishing of Lol Stein. A first edition, numbered 29. Things were underlined, annotated... There were even marks of nail varnish. It was alive and sensual. I read it and reread it. And I never gave it back. It became one of my most important possessions, even... I think the most important. Sorry, I'm gabbling on. No, on the contrary. Did she advise you to write, as a profession? Not exactly, but she broadened my horizons. She first told me about the Hypokhâgne course. At 18, I headed for Paris. Like me. Then what? I began working like mad. I loved that. Intellectually, it was crazy. That's when I wrote my first novel. Did you feel you made sacrifices or give things up to write? Not at all. It was natural. I didn't take a day off for years. I was always at my desk, Sundays, Christmas... I was very... very serious at your age, very obsessive. Really? Your books show a hedonist. Maybe, but I had to conquer that. In any case, we won't find paper here. What do you mean by conquer? At some point in my life, I decided to become more carefree. My problem is I'm too carefree. A voice tells me, "You could die tomorrow, so make the most of it." It's a good thing too, being in the present. But it prevents me... I'll never accomplish anything. I fear I'll become a vegetative mollusc. Is that another door? Someone's there. Grouchy Odile! She's a sly one. What? Your perfume's nice. Daniel? Why're you here? I wanted to see you. Didn't you have meetings? Moreau-Babin, here to keep an eye on her. I hear things are rocky. You know him? Yeah. I'll introduce you. He often brings writers. Ok, Daniel? Hi, Yoann. Good to see you. Coming! I think you know Anaïs. We met at Patrick and Laure's. Yes. Are you well? I'm ok. So, you write? No, I don't write. I thought this was a special event for professional writers. I'm just here as an observer. You know, there are still people fascinated by literature. Ok, wonderful. Maybe they need help. Why are you here? - Sorry? - Why did you come? You're crazy! Why are you here? This isn't a movie. - I wanted to see her. - You plan to tell her everything? Very original. Tell me how you'll destroy my couple. You think I'm dumb? You'd never understand. You think I'm dumb! When did you get here? Two days ago. When do you go? I don't need permission to see my wife! Not so loud! "My wife". That obscene sense of ownership... She's not yours. You're not even married. This is a madhouse! Remember you texted me to meet up. So don't lecture me now! - Everything ok? - Just fine. Thank you. I told you I don't know my contract number. I'm not at home. You can find it. You have my details. Yes, I'll hold. I don't believe it. Incident. Odile, hello. Incident. May I borrow your car? What for? There's a fire at my place, I need to check my insurance. Yoann's at the station with it. Three people just left. Anaïs, what's wrong? 75010. The Koreans set my kitchen on fire. I may not be insured. It'll cost a bomb. - Your place is on fire? - No. Yes! No! It's hell, I spoke to some woman who was probably in Romania. Hey, your car! May I borrow it? You came by car? Yes, well... Of course. - I'll drive you - Thank you. - Coming too? - I have my speech to write. My landlady now... I'll get the car. I know. They're Korean, not Chinese. They're my cousins. It's under control, right? The fire's out? Yes, fortunately. But your cousins... We were really scared. The alarm didn't go off. They could've all died. I said not to use the stove. They don't always understand. I have to go. I'll call you. How's your thesis going? Couldn't you find a better surprise for her than turning up here? Wasn't it due early July? The second part. You give the impression... you were at a loss this weekend or... It's really intrusive. - That was it! - I have another idea. It'll be easier to sort out in Paris. Are you crazy? I even brought your bags. He's out of his mind. May I sit there? Excuse me. Thank you. I thought you went home. Did you sort the insurance? Yes, in Guingamp. She's so beautiful... Yes. I was asked to pick a film that revolves around a writer, a female writer. Could you move along? I couldn't find anything convincing, so I opted for this. The portrait of a woman, period. You're really sick. You seem sane but you're perverse. I can't hear! A woman floundering. Dear Georges, I won't forget... Does a threesome turn you on? Spare me the clichés. I won't stand for it! She's seen us! Before, when asked why I write, I used to say because I wanted to. A pure impulse. But, with passing time, I've often wondered what it means to devote my life to writing. Why're you here? I wanted to see you. That's new. Where's Emilie? Forget Emilie. I'm going back to Paris. Coming? Why go back? It was planned. A meeting tomorrow morning. A problem with Emilie? No, not at all. Excuse me. Hold on, Daniel, don't you realize? Emilie is wonderful, beautiful, brilliant... Believe me, she's old enough to defend herself. Does she know we had... Not at all. What do you care anyway? - Why did she throw you out? - She didn't. Come back to Paris. No, I want to stay with Emilie. It's ridiculous. Forget you and me. Come on, that's absurd. I came here for her. What? You want to be friends with... You can't understand. Enough. I should tell her, so she'll see through you. No, I... You approached her despite our affair. You're so twisted. I didn't know her. I betrayed her without knowing her. If she knew, she'd never let you get close. I was looking for you. What're you doing? Odile asked me to feed the ducks. Let's go for a dip. I mean, you said you wanted to see the sea. I can't now. I have to... You're kidding. There aren't even any ducks. Come on. See that tree there? The corkscrew-shaped one. It's over 200 years old. It adapted. You get nowhere with ducks. I guess because they're wild. They're wild animals. Stop! Want to come for a dip? No, thank you. It's sunny, it won't take long. I have my talk at 3. You've worked enough. You'll regret not coming. Can I fetch my swimsuit? Yes. You just dump a threesome on me. This will sound weird and you've no reason to agree, but... You have to leave me with Emilie. I'm begging you. You can change my life. Without being too grandiloquent, my fate's in your hands. What the fuck? I need to be alone with Emilie. It's not some fantasy, it's crucial. Sure you can drive? Who do you think I am? - Back by 2 PM. - Yes. Just go. - It's because I.... - Just go, please! Some music? I have a great song on my phone. Sure you can drive? Of course. Give me a break! I press "play"? Yes. That's a call. Anaïs? It's Christian Jouannet. Hello, sir. I keep calling you! Where are you? I need you in Rouen now! I'm very angry with you. Our conference is tomorrow and you have all the documents for that thing... the PowerPoint. Sorry, I had to leave in a hurry to see my mother. Your mother? Seriously? She's sick. - Cancer. I'm at the hospital. - Oh, no. I didn't know. We'll work something out. My conference is nothing compared to your worries. All the best. Thank you. You too. I'll call Mum. I'm superstitious. She really has cancer. Shit... She's ok, she's starting treatment. I'm just scared I'll jinx her. Hello? Mum? It's me. Is everything ok? No, no reason. I was thinking of you. I'll call you back if you're in a hurry. Have you had any new results? Great. Alright. Take care. Sorry. We can go for our dip now. As you don't like my driving... How old's your mother? She's young. She's 58. If she dies, I'm scared it'll destroy me. Extinguish me. I find that sick, that side of it... the collateral damage of misfortune. Losing your mother means losing the one who's always known you. You end up alone in the world. No one will worry about you, and your life, and put you ahead of everything. It's horrible and, on top of it, you lose your joy and impetus. I don't want to be sad. I don't want life to crush me. I'm scared of collapsing. I barely know you, but you don't seem to collapse easily. Far from it. Besides, misfortunes are part of the plan. That's what living is. Suffering, fighting, surviving. Great... It's crazy no one tells us life is hell. A vale of tears. Yes, you're right. Everyone should read Schopenhauer at the age of six. We've come a long way. You walk fast. You make me chase you. Do you lie often? Do you lie? Not as blatantly as you... I never lie. I hate It. You fooled your tutor earlier. Ok, but that was... I'd have had to leave otherwise. I love warm sand. Tell me... What? I'm here, Anaïs. You wanted me, I'm here. Say something. I want to... I want to kiss you. I thought you took what you wanted. I didn't think you were shy. I'm not, usually. Come on. Let's not rush things. I love your kisses. A few weeks later There, that's it. It's too hot and it itches. Please, wear it while we eat. I look like a cabaret dancer! You're beautiful. - Sure. - You can't be bald. Put this in the freezer, it got warm. I'm doing Gilbert's feed. Champagne for Mum's chemo? We never see each other and we aren't in mourning! Any excuse for a drink. Rebecca just left you her monkey? It's a lemur. She couldn't take it home with her. Balthazar's training to be a dad. Talking of home, you're lucky you weren't evicted. Anaïs is like me. Her irresistible charm saves her. No, it's thanks to me. I sweet-talked her landlady while she was away... Let's eat. ...enjoying the meadow grass. You jerk! Here, Mum. I'm not hungry, thanks. - It makes you feel sick? - Yes. Everything does. How can you live here? The crowds, the traffic... After three days, I want to get home to the quiet. Shit, my back. François, I want a photo with the kids. Come here. Want to be in it, Gilbouze? Come on, Gilbert. Let's do a photo. Anaïs, put your phone down. Thank you. - There. - Ok? Let me see. I check as his photos are hazy now. He can't see well! Beautiful! Another, with your glasses. We're not taking 50 photos. You'll be glad to have memories when I'm dead. - That's not funny. - I'm serious. Sorry. I need you. I can't replace you. Are you ready? A smile? That's great. Anaïs, I have time to write at last. I think of you too. I think of how lucky we are. I can see your face, your dark, wild eyes. I remember your silky skin, your intoxicating scent, and your lips, and your tongue... Write to me again. Write to me. Emilie, I can't go 20 more days without you. Not even one day. What if I came for the weekend? There's a train at 6 PM. I can be there for dinner. We'd kiss, over and over, discover and love each other. Say yes. My beauty, I love reading you, as I love knowing you think of me. It would be wonderful to see you, but I must keep working. Don't be angry. Last night, I dreamed of you. You had that blend of audacity and timidity that charmed me in Kerduel. My Anaïs, are you real? Yes, I'm real. You're content with letters, but I'm not. I want your kisses and even more. I want to do everything with you. Tell me how to calm my impatience. Only a week now. It's not long at all. And waiting can be as delicious as what you wait for. You're beautiful. So are you. Is here ok? Hello. I'll have a glass of a light white wine, please. The same. Is the essay done? Yes. I'm pleased. I sent it to my publisher earlier. Really? You said I'd read it first. I said that? In an email, yes. I'll give it to you. I should hope so. Look. I found it. I don't believe it! I hassled everyone at Kerduel. Thank you. It's incredible. It's yours. Number 29. Yes. Thank you. You're so tanned. I didn't think you could get so brown. Over the summer, I'm always out in the wild. Pity we weren't together. Yes. It was horrible. Know what I told myself? Once you've finished with the book, we could go away for a few days. We could go to Italy. I have things to tell you, Anaïs. Things? There's no room in my life for an affair. I don't want to offer you something mediocre. Something in half-measures. You expect more. And you're right. That's what attracted me, your demanding nature. The way you ask so much from life, the best. Did I scare you? I'm 56 years old. Nothing much scares me. I don't get it. I thought... we both found it wonderful. It was wonderful. I spent the summer thinking of you, thinking how lucky I was, writing pages and pages in my diary about your youth and beauty... But it was... How can I put it? It was outside of time. Outside of time? What does that mean? You mustn't be sad. You wanted to experience it and you did. You lived out your desire. Do you realize that? You were so free and so brave... You seduced me. I could never have done that at your age. But I... I can't see why you'd rather give it up than seize moments of pleasure we could have. I won't feel guilty for disappointing you. I have nothing to offer you. Besides, what you feel for me, sorry, isn't love, it's an illusion. It isn't. Of course it is. You projected a lot onto me. You're smart enough to understand. You already know it. And there was Daniel. I don't want to know what happened, but there was something. I know you moved and unsettled him, attracted him... That's life. But... is all this some way of getting revenge? Don't be silly. I worked all summer in exaltation. I hadn't felt so happy and carefree in ages. So full of energy. And... It was all thanks to you. I'd also like to give you something, Anaïs. You charmed me, conquered me... You're able to obtain what you want. You can move mountains. You have to use that. You and I had something that was ardent, vibrant, sincere. It's beautiful and precious. You're right to take love seriously, but don't let it take over. Don't lose or forget yourself. If you have to write, do it. But at least do something. Do something with what you live. With what you live, with what you are. Do something. We won't meet again? No, it's for the best. I don't agree. Come. Subtitles by Ian Burley Subtitling: HIVENTY
