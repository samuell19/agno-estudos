I wait for Christmas All year long How I wish that I could only change it Take the calendar and rearrange it Then every day Would be so nice Candy canes And all the snow... [mutters to self] Keep an open mind. Don't look for a reason to run. [chuckles weakly] Sam? Dr. Vance DeBlaine. So sorry I'm late. Surgery ran long. All good. Nice to finally meet you. Same. I know we said drinks, but should we grab a table? Most people think a tonsillectomy is just for when you're young, but a lot of adults have 'em, too. Is that so? It is. So, Sam, your profile said you're a business manager? Vague, I know. Uh, basically I help high-net worth clients manage their money and assets and guide them to, hopefully, make prudent decisions. Right now, I'm trying to convince one client not to buy a social media company. [kids giggling loudly] Kids are so cute at that age. Hmm? Ah. Don't mind me, I'm kid-crazy right now. My brother and his wife just had twins back in August. My first time being an uncle. Aww! Wanna see pictures of them? Oh, no, that's okay. I-- Oh, yes, there they are-- there are two of 'em. Leah and Chloe. They live in Portland. I can't wait to see them for Christmas. Makes me want to have twins when I get married. [whispers] Check? [mouths words] Do you have any nieces or nephews? Hmm? Uh, yes. One of each. Miles and Dania. They live with my sister and brother-in-law in Brayden. That's not too far away. You must see them all the time. Not really. Being self-employed means working 24/7. [chuckles] You know, plus, I find the suburbs confusing with all the peace and quiet and lawn gnomes in front of the identical houses. It's... Will you see them for Christmas? No! Heh-heh! I will be on a plane to Hawaii in T-minus 22 hours and four minutes. It's my first attempt at relaxation in longer than I care to admit, because... well, it'll just depress me. Wait. You're going to Hawaii for Christmas? That's right. Without your family? Yes. [***] [***] [giggling and laughing] Mm. I'm sorry, Murph. No time for fetch. -[phone rings] -Off to work I go. [rings] Hey, Mom. Hello, my baby boy. Would you like to come over for lunch? I made extra lasagna. And Arabella is here while your brother's at the store. I wish I could, but I'm off to work on Kathleen and Nate's nursery. You know, their baby's due New Year's. That's right! Hey, did they give you any tips on adopting? Yeah, they did, and, uh, I'm looking over some documents. Oh, and I have an appointment with their lawyer in January. [gasps] This is so exciting! Maybe, by next Christmas, I'll be a grandma again. Hey, whoa-ho, whoa. Tap the breaks. I can practically see you knitting booties now. Look, this is gonna take some time, and a surprisingly hefty retainer fee for me to get things in place. Well, don't wait too long. Your brothers and sisters have a head start on you. I'm starting to lose count of how many grandkids I have. -Grandma! -[chuckling] That's very funny. I'll call you later. Bye-bye, honey. Good morning. Morning! [splat] [kids chuckling] You are in such trouble! -Now? -Now! But that's-- ...Two weeks early. I thought we were having a New Year's baby. Christmas. We're not ready! Tell that to the baby. Oh, I'm bringing it up when she's 18. We need to focus! And pack! -Okay. -Okay. Yeah. [***] Lydia said the birth mother just started having real contractions. Okay, so we may have a bit of time. I think so. The drive from here to Buffalo is nine hours. Yeah, and that huge snowstorm's a couple days away. That's not our biggest problem right now. What's our biggest problem right now? Who's gonna watch Miles and Dania while we're gone? Right, yeah, the kids. Uh, what about your mom? She's still at her art retreat in Italy. She's not supposed to fly in until the day after Christmas. Yeah, my parents are still on vacation in Sydney. Where's Frank? Dad's at his fishing cabin with-- [both] ...No service. What about Miles watching Dania? I mean, he's 13 now. Right, yeah. Terrible idea. Forget I suggested it. [sighing heavily] Whoever it is has to be trustworthy and responsible. And have nothing else going on... four days before Christmas. [ding] -This Christmas -[both exhaling deeply] I'll dream of a private yacht I'm not saying that you can't buy the yacht, Stavros. I'm asking if it's truly the best use of your bonus, considering you already have one. [***] Yes, you did. Last year. There you go! Exactly! Okay, so, there are many things we can do. We can take the-- [sighs] Tigers... are illegal. Uh, Stavros... I'm gonna have to call you back on my way to Hawaii, okay? Just-- Just don't buy anything! What? Shut the front door! Mm-hmm! That's why she was acting weird! Yeah, it turns out she was planning the world's most romantic proposal. Did she dress up in a suit of armor and ride a horse with a jousting pole and the ring on it? Did one of your clients do that? Uh, Omar. Don't ask me how I found the jousting pole. Whoa! Never. And, no, she didn't. It was roses, "I love you," and this ring. It's perfect. This deserves a toast. Oh, my god. I knew you'd have two champagne flutes handy. In my line of work, you always have to be ready to celebrate in case a big deal goes through. And this... pretty much qualifies as a big deal. -[pop] -Boom! [both laugh] It's exciting! Okay, but really, can you believe it? Like, I'm engaged? Honestly, Ellie? I can't. Didn't we always say that marriage is for other people? Yeah. Well... I don't know, things change when you meet "the one". I heard it-- it's cliche, but it's true. I'll take your word for it. Hey, you know what? It could happen for you, too, though. Oh... wait. It can't, 'cause that means that you'd have to make it to a second date and like, you know-- oh, that thing you do, where you look for a reason to run-- yeah, you can't do that. Then what? Move to the suburbs and settle down, like my sister? Or me and Abbie. We're talking about moving there. We could be neighbors again! [scoffs] Please. Can you imagine me... in the suburbs with a husband, a dog, and an SUV? Why not? Sam... more than anything, I just... you know, I hope one day you find a guy that makes you want to break open a bottle of champagne and, you know, have it just be for you. [clink] Congrats. Thank you. [***] [laughing] Uncle Jason? -Oh, hey, Arabella. -Grandma told me to bring this to you, in case you get hungry. Oh, thanks. Lasagna. Of course. Hi, Arabella. Hey, Miles. Are you gonna be at the play tryouts tomorrow? Yeah, sure. Totally. -Yeah. -Cool. See you there. Bye, Uncle Jason. -Bye, Arabella. -Bye. Bye. So, the community center's doing The Life and Times of Santa Clausthis year. Arabella's the Elf Queen. And the kid who's supposed to be the narrator has to go out of town, so they're looking for a replacement, ASAP. -Got it. -I can text your parents the info, if you really want to audition? [blurts nervously] Yeah, I do. Thanks. [smooching] [laughs] Look at you. I'm gonna get you! Okay, you two. Anything? Aunt Martha's in Oklahoma. [sighs] Uh, what about the Huttons? Hedy said that they're going to Pat's family's in Michigan tomorrow. Yeah, we're just so close to Christmas. [voices carrying] What about Jason? He's babysat the kids before and he's thinking about adopting-- this could be a trial run. Well, you know, we just hired him as the contractor for the nursery. It feels like a lot to ask more than an evening, you know, like we're-- Yeah, taking advantage. [both cringing] Yeah. [inhales sharply] We could ask your brother. Are you kidding? Don't you remember what happened last time? -[flames whooshing] -[alarm blaring] [blasting] [wheezing and choking] [hacking and coughing] [coughs and sputters] I'll totally pay for that. [coughs] [smoke alarm blares] [whoosh] He did pay for it. That's not the point! Sam doesn't know the first thing about kids. Plus, he'd probably say "no" anyhow. He hasn't visited us since... [***] Hey, um... Sam's family. He's only a couple of hours away. And, hon? He's kind of our only option. [tropical music plays] [Jason hums and scats to the tune] [phone begins ringing] Bah, buh-buh [ringing] Is everything okay? Why do you say it like that? [exhales deeply] Because... we haven't talked since... [words catch] Did Mom tell you that Nate and I are adopting again? Yeah, she mentioned something about that a few months ago. How's that going, by the way? The birth mother just went into labor. Ah! So goin' soon, then? Sooner than expected. She wasn't supposed to arrive until New Year's. [phone alert chimes] And Mom was gonna help-- -Uh-huh. ...But she's not set to arrive until the 26th, to watch Miles and Dania, and we have to drive out to Buffalo to get the baby today. It'll cost her a kidney to rebook this close to Christmas. That's what she said. Anyway... we need to find someone A.S.A.P. to come here and be with the kids until we get back. [record scratches] Wait... are you asking me to babysit? I know it's been a really long time since you've been drafted into service-- Years! It's been years, Kath. We're obviously desperate, but you are the only person who never goes anywhere for the holidays. And you can make all of your work calls here... when you're not with the kids, of course. [grunts in frustration] Ah... [Dania] Mom! You're gonna make me do it, aren't you? Fine. I'm calling in the Calvin Card. [horrified] What? It has been 22 years! You made me lie to Mom and Dad about where you were on Senior Night in high school when you snuck out with Calvin Carnackie to Central Park, and I told them that you were with Sonya Perez and Lola Kurtz, so that you wouldn't get grounded for the whole entire summer. You totally owe me-- big-time! Oh! I can't believe you're calling that in! [exhales victoriously] Desperate times, desperate measures. Isn't there, like, a-- a professional Mary Poppins service out there you could hire? Someone who has the slightest clue on what to do with children? And who didn't blow up the house last time they tried? You know what? [huffs] I knew better than to ask, but Nate pulled his "Sam's family" Jedi mind-tricks, and I fell for it. I guess I'm just gonna have to leave Miles in charge after all. Merry Christmas, Sam. [dial tone beeps and buzzes] [***] -[ring] -[beep] Miles being in charge was sarcasm, right? He's 13. Of course, it was sarcasm. Just checking. [inhales] How long would this... arrangement entail? Two days. Probably. "Probably"? You know, Sam... babies have their own schedules. But you won't. I will leave you a detailed one and make sure that you don't have to worry about a thing. [screams] Ahhhhh! [inhales] [forced cheer] Okay. Seriously? Okay! Wow! Thank you! But I don't have to cook? Absolutely not. [relieved sigh] [beep] [***] Best behavior from both of you, okay? Jason's gonna watch over you until Uncle Sam gets here. I don't need a babysitter anymore. Well, your sister does. Unless you wanna do all the cooking and cleaning for her while I'm gone? [kids] No! I'll stay until your brother gets here. And I'll finish up the nursery before you get back. [sighing] You're amazing. Thank you so much. Okay, car's packed. Christmas is in four days. You'll be back in time, right? Of course, sweetie! Promise? I promise. We'll absolutely be back in time for Christmas. And we'll bring your new baby sister, too. Later, buddy. -Oh! Bye. I'm sorry-- you gave up Hawaii... to babysit? Didn't give up. I merely delayed my departure. But my baby sister hasn't asked me to watch the kids since... Since you almost burned down their kitchen, making an omelette? It was a minor fire, quickly extinguished. Plus, my plan is just to order in everything. That's expensive. Cheaper than a remodel. Sam, you have an aversion to kids. No, no, not an aversion. I'm awkward and uncomfortable. Mainly when they're tiny. But Miles is like 13, he's practically in college now and-- -What? -...Dania is... ...well, she's somewhere between like six and... ten, so, we're going to be able to communicate like adults. It's gonna be a disaster. Oh! Ye of little faith. I am going to rock these two nights of gunclehood and then it's off to checking work emails on sandy beaches, sipping Mai Tais. I got this. You got this. Yeah... I got this! Sorry. [slaps shoulder] [***] [game music plays] [game audience applauds] [grunts] [***] [grunting] -Yeah! -Oh! Let's go! That's it-- time for you to hit the hay. Oh, come on. This is just 'cause you lost. And because it's 15 minutes past when your mom said she wanted you to be in bed. But, in deference to your victory... ...I'll clean up. -Yes! -[chuckling] [***] I think this is the place. Thanks for the ride. [car door shuts] [***] I got it. No problemo. [***] Oh... Oh. Wow. Okay. [ring clinking on gnome] [knocking] [loud dog barking] Whoa! Whoa... Hi. [***] Who are you? I'm... the guy who lives here. Jason... DeVito. Your family's neighbor. Oh! Hi! Sam. Dalton. The brother. Which you obviously already know. Obviously. I've said "obviously" twice. [chuckling awkwardly] Uh... this way. Right! All these houses out here, they just... they look-- they look the same to me. So, when was the last time you were in Brayden? A while. Kathleen and Nate usually come to visit me in the big city, when they need some grown-up time. You're new. Yes and no. Well, you guys sure do like to go all out for Christmas around here. Well, you should see my mom and pop's place across the street. Oh, your parents are across the street? Yeah, for a few years. Then my place opened up around the time my great-aunt Mimi-- God rest her soul-- [smooch] ...left me enough for a downpayment. Here I am. [chuckles awkwardly] Here you are. Enough about me. Wow. Kathleen left this for you. Ah, yes! The schedule! Wow. This is the longest document I've seen that wasn't a mortgage application. She has got this down to the minute! 7 A.M.-- "Wake up". Oof! 7:10-- "Make sure children are awake." Oh, she's serious. 7:15-- "Begin ordering breakfast. Menus are in the... kitchen." I'm feeling very "Maria Von Trapp meets the Captain" at the moment. [***] Oh, she doesn't have the play on here. -Play? -Yeah, there's an audition for the Christmas play, tomorrow at 10 A.M. I was in Christmas plays when I was a kid. I once played an elf named Gunther. Pretty sure that's the origin of my lederhosenaversion. Ahem. You were saying? Yeah, Miles really wants to audition. He kinda has a crush on my niece, but we don't discuss it. Wise. Ha. Well, what does she have down for 10? Uh, "Christmas Crafts. Make stocking for baby." Okay. Well, I'm already taking my niece Arabella to the auditions-- I can take Miles, too, and then you're free to make the stocking with Dania. Yeah, okay. -Are you sure? -Yeah. And that way, you'll be back on schedule by noon, for, um... "lunch". [laughs silently] That's great. Cool. Okay. Yeah. [***] Where are the kids, anyway? They're asleep. So early? It's past 10:30 P.M. Which is late... for children. And for me, too, so, if you're okay here, I'm gonna head home. -[huffs anxiously] -[phone chimes] Uh... I airdropped my contact info to your phone, so, if you need any help, I'm just right next door. Bless you. [relieved chuckle] You're doing a good thing, Sam... the brother. Thank you, Jason... the neighbor. Night. [to self] Don't look for a reason to run. You so got this! Mm-hmm. -[clattering and crashing] -Oh... ooh. [***] [***] [gasps] Who are you? Uh... Sam. Your uncle? My uncle Sam has a mustache. Th-That was an unfortunate phase that was blessedly brief. Uncle Sam! Oh! Oh... hi! I texted Mom. She said I could have pancakes for breakfast! Oh... [exhales] Oh! [***] Oh! [chuckles] You're up! [grumpy] You're late. "Somebody" hasn't had their morning coffee. I'm 13. I don't drink coffee. Good call! Guess that leaves you out, too, then, huh? Good call. So, where is the, uh, machine? With the... you know? Pods. We don't use pods because plastic stays around in landfills for a million-billion years. Okay, fair. But what do the adults of the household-- A.K.A. "Mom and Dad" to you-- drink for caffeine? Dad drinks kombucha and Mom drinks tea. This is a coffee-free home? I really feel like that should've been conveyed earlier. Want me to get you a kombucha? Not if my life depended on it. I'll make do with tea. Now! Breakfast! You're not gonna cook, are you? Eh! No. Heh. Luckily, your mother's unnervingly thorough schedule on what the next two days looks like, includes delivery places, which means breakfast pancakes are gonna be provided by... Oh! "Clean Green Food". Oof, I'm gonna lose so much weight. [phone dials] [out-of-service tone plays] [recording] We're sorry. Your call cannot be completed as dialed. Please check the area code and number, then dial-- I'm hungry! Yep, any second now... any second. [out-of-service tone plays] We're sorry. Your call cannot be completed-- Uh... okay. So, apparently, this "Clean Green" is having some technical issues. Do you know any other restaurants we could order from? They're the only vegan place nearby that'll deliver breakfast. "Vegan"? Dania's vegan now. Willingly? [whimpers] Oh, okay. Um... does cereal count? Huh? How about that? [whines] Mom said pancakes! Does she do this a lot? I will give you 50 bucks to not make that face anymore. [cries out] I just want pancakes! We really gotta work on your negotiating skills, kid. Kid? [Dania moans wailfully] Hello. Hey, sweetie. There's eggnog on the table. Now go inside. I'll be in there in a second, okay? [chuckles] -Hey, Ma. -Mm. -How are you? -I'm good. Okay. Hey. Thanks for taking Bella to this play thing. It's just right in the middle of the store's Christmas rush. Yeah. Of course. How are you doing? I'm hangin' in. It's the first Christmas as a single dad, so, uh... Arabella knows you're doing your best. Thanks, Ma. I hope so. Parenting isn't easy. Oh, ho, ho, ho. You're preaching to the choir. [laughs] You sure you wanna tackle this solo? I'm tired of waiting for someone to want to join me. Which could be never at this rate, so... Well, not with that attitude. Jason, you spent too long in Los Angeles, looking for the right guy-- you've only been in town a year. You never know who you'll meet. [phone chimes] [***] [door opens] [whining sadly] [***] [quietly] I'm sorry! I didn't know who else to call. Apparently, it's vegan pancakes or deep sighs of disappointment, followed by a face I usually only see right before someone breaks up with me. [sighs despondently] So do you want me to find the recipe for you? It's a little more complicated than that, in the fact that I don't, uh... you know-- cook. Ever. Oh, right. The fire. They told you? Only because I did some minor renovations for them last summer, and I found some scorch marks that the other contractor missed. Who knew dried chives were that flammable, huh? It was like a tinderbox! Just... [whooshes] But we're gonna focus on the now. Right. Now, I will pay you a hundred dollars to make me a vegan pancake breakfast. [***] Do you want to give it a try? Or make sure the griddle's hot? Thank you. Okay. And we just need a little bit more flour. And the flour... flour. This is flour? Just... scoop. [coughs] -And now the oat milk. -Mm-hmm. Ooh! All right. There we go. Now all we have to do is make them... Christmas pancakes. Wow! Nice trick. Do you have kids? Not yet. But I do have 18 nieces and nephews. I'm sorry, what? Jason has a big family. I'm the youngest of seven kids. W-- Wow. And one thing I learned along the way is how to create things like... Christmas pancakes. Actual Christmas pancakes! Who knew? [bell dings] Wow! Oh! We have to leave for the auditions in 15 minutes. I'll be ready. Jason? Can I talk to you for a second? [exhales] So, you're really good at this "uncle" thing. I suppose. I don't know what I'm doing, even with the world's most comprehensive set of instructions. Don't be so hard on yourself, you just got started. Yet, I've already failed three times. You know what? I want to hire you. What? To co-nanny or... manny or uncle... whatever-- I just need someone to help me until I get the hang of things. -You don't have to hire me. -I wouldn't feel right asking you for help every two seconds. I wouldn't know what to charge, and besides, I'm already here working on the nursery-- Perfect! You're already here! And I've seen the room, it's practically done. Good job, you! -I-I don't know... -I mean, you said it yourself, you have, what-- 800 nieces and nephews? 18. Potato/po-tah-to! You're an expert! I'm stuck in beginner mode. Think of yourself as... an "uncle consultant". -An uncle-- -For two days. Name your price. Do you always throw money at a problem? Only when I think it'll work. Well, I do need to hire a lawyer. Okay, really not that serious. I was thinking-- Yeah, for something else, and, um, the retainer fee is three times what I budgeted for. What's the fee? [***] Done! [***] Well, looks like you got yourself an uncle consultant. Yes, I do. Oh, and, uh... here. You got some green batter on your Rossini loafers. Oh! Thanks. Hey, Jason? How'd you know these were Rossini loafers? [quietly] Oh? [realizing] Oh! No... [***] Look at all the big Nutcrackers! Whoa! Look at all the big Nutcrackers! Ah, I take it you didn't go to a lot of these growing up? Does the Museum of Modern Art count? There's a slight difference. Well, I gotta go paint sets until the auditions are over. Oh. Okay. Uh, yeah. Go. Go, go, go. Text me when you're done. Hey, Logan. Kevin. -Hey. -How are you? Nice to see you. [exchange continues indistinctly] [Sam] Interesting. [***] Uncle Sam? Hey... Niece Dania. The Christmas stocking craft booth is this way. There's the reindeer toss! May we do that, please? Don't you want to make a stocking for your new baby sister? Maybe later. Let's go! [***] Hey, Uncle Eddie. Hey, kiddo! Your cousins are getting fitted for their costumes, and after that, Ms. Latsko wants to see you for Elf Queen. Where's the fitting area? I'll show you. I just got done. [Arabella] Good luck, Miles. Hey! Thanks so much for coming to try out, Miles. We were left in a lurch, so this is real helpful. And, uh... Pete asked me to drop Arabella back by his house when it's over. I'll tell Mom. -Have fun. -Let's go! Come on. [thump] Oh? Yeah! You are a reindeer ring-toss ringer. What does a "ringer" mean? It means you get another stuffed reindeer. Your turn, Uncle Sam. Oh, no, this isn't for me. You don't know until you try. Some things you just know. Mom's good at this game. Nice psychological trick there, kid. I see what you did. I don't know what that means. It means you have tapped into my sibling-rivalry side. Let's do this! All right. Here we go. Just a little, uh... a little rusty. It's the wind. Yep, wind's blowing that way, so you gotta... trajectory, you know. You'll learn it later. Uh, okay, here we go. So... [gasps] [sheepish chuckle] Sorry. Just... uh... Hey, batter-batter, hey, batter. Hey, batter, hey, batter! Sah-wing, batter-- oh! [crow squawks] Okay... hi. Hi. See, the problem is, sometimes, I'm so strong, I don't-- oh! [phone ringing] Oh, I gotta take this. Uh... you, um-- -Hello? -You know, uh, just... [Kathleen] Sam? Here, just play a few-- -Hello? -...Hundred rounds on me, okay? Uh... hi, Sis! Hey, how's it going? Hey. I'm calling to give you an update on the baby. Where are you? Oh, we're at the Christmas Fair with Dania, -where she has just won... -[crowd applauding] ...Another stuffed reindeer! Go, you! Good job! You know, I actually think she's found her life calling. Aren't you supposed to be doing the crafts that I scheduled for now? Uh, yeah, well, we're gonna get to that in a little bit. Sam! It is really important to stay on schedule. Kids need structure. Is everything okay with the baby? Yes, thankfully. Things are just taking a little longer than anticipated. Well, you think you're gonna be back by Christmas? So far, we're still on track for that, but it's gonna be closer than we thought. Where's Miles? He's auditioning for the Christmas play. Ohh! The play! I totally forgot about that. Yeah, Jason didn't. He's with him right now. Jason? Yeah, your neighbor with like a thousand nieces and nephews? He's helping me with the kids. I figured that's okay, since, well... you left them with him until I arrived. No. That's fine. Jason's great with kids. Yeah, and also very good-looking and gay! And how come you never told me about him before? I thought about it when he first moved in next door, but you two are very different. He's really serious about having a family, Sam. And you're... I'm...? [non-committal grunt] Kath! Dr. March called. We're back on! [gasps] Gotta go, Sam! No, no, no, no! Don't go! I-- W-Wait, wait, wait, wait! [texts chiming] [***] Dania? Don't forget your winnings. [***] [exhaling deeply] Hey, what'd you want to talk about? Here. I'll be in in a second. Got it. [Dania] I am so in love with my reindeers. [Miles] There are a lot of them! Have you named them? [Dania] Not yet. [door creaks shut] So, my brother, Eddie, is directing the Christmas play this year, and he said that the only reason that Miles got the part is because the other kid trying out gets queasy when he's nervous. I think he was off because my niece was talking with another boy. Ah, yes. Young love is tough. Old love's not much better. What do we do? Well, I was thinking-- since you said you'd done plays before-- that you might have some advice for him. No, that was many years ago. Were you any good? I was. Uh, despite the lederhosen. Somehow, I knew you would be. I can't tell-- is that a
