Here at the bar. Round on me. What you say, Dupree? To women. Where you goin' with this? They're all seductresses. They all Sheba, goddess of death. Except my wife. No, she... is an angel. And I risked it all. What? May we get everything we want and nothing we deserve. Freeze! Dupree Williams, turn around! Turn around! Turn around! Get on your knees! Put your hands behind your head. Now! Do it! Look, we're just going in circles here so why don't you just admit what you did and this can all be over. I don't even know why I'm here. You don't even know why you're here? Look at her. Look what you did. Look at it! - Is that my wife? - Of course it's your wife! Why, did you kill somebody else? Just admit what you did. Your fingerprints, they're everywhere. The kitchen, the knife, everywhere. You're going to fry for this! Oh, my God. I didn't... I know who did it. A second ago, you didn't know anything and now you know who did it? Let me explain... You're under arrest for the murder of... I know who did this. - It was a... - Stand up! All rise. Madam forewoman, have you reached a verdict? We have, Your Honor. We, the jury, find Dupree Williams guilty of first degree murder. What? What the hell are they talkin' about? - I didn't kill anybody. - Order. Mr. Williams, you will remain in custody until sentencing. I didn't kill my wife. - Bailiff. - Get the hell off me. - Order. - I didn't kill anybody. Get the hell off me! I didn't kill anybody! I didn't kill my wife! Dad! Dad, you're missing the party! They'll be just fine. They came to be seen and put pictures on the internet, anyway. Well, I'm here for you. Are you really going to marry that boy? - Dad? - He's a musician. And what kind of name is Mathias, anyway? It's a family name. It's a dog's name. Dad. What is it? I have something for you. Oh! It is your birthday. I know you're not the flashy type but you should know someone would spend it on... Do anything for you. Oh! Dad, I... Gosh. But hey. Don't settle for anything less. Please. Ready to head in? Not yet. Brooke. I just... I need a moment, Mathias. Mm. Babe, you have to eat. I did. Mm, a couple bites. It's the best food in the city. Brooke. I'm sorry you have to go through this right now, especially with everything you've been through. I know he didn't like me. I'm here for you. I haven't slept in a while. I close my eyes and I lie there but... I don't sleep. The medication isn't helping? It just makes me feel blah. What about your husband? Is he responding more to your needs? He has a ton of great qualities but recognizing how other people are feeling... - Not one of them? - No, not really. Brooke. What you're feeling is common after a long stay in a hospital. It may take some time for you to find yourself again. I just... I just feel alone sometimes. Why don't you trust yourself? What is that supposed to mean? Well, sometimes we allow things to spin on us because we don't trust that if we try to stop it, we can. You can. Trust you. Hey. You wanna reschedule? No. So I have here a copy of the will detailing everything that we discussed. Now, once you sign these documents, you'll become a silent partner in his five remaining businesses. Now we discuss his estate. And he had most of his art collection sold to simplify things, make you more liquid. But he did leave you his more valuable pieces. Still spoiling you, it seems. Even in his absence. You know, Brooke, your father, he was more than just a mentor. He was like a big brother. You do know that, right? You're like family to me, too, Uncle Reggie. Okay. So after liquidation, consolidations, insurances and taxes, this is what you'll receive. Substantial. I know. But once you sign, it's yours. Hey, Brooke. This is my finance guy. He works at the firm. He's a smart kid. Use him. - What was that about? - Nothing. Babe, I know this isn't ideal but there are a lot of people that aren't as blessed as you. To come from a family like yours, I mean. We can finally take that trip I've been promising now. We just have to think of a positive way to look at this. You comin' to bed? Mm. In a little bit. One! One-two! One-two-three! One-two-three! One-two-three! One-two-three! - Time. - Whoo. You ready to come in? - Uh, no, thank you. - She's a lover. How're you feelin'? You all loose and limber? I'm ready to put my hands on somebody. - Easy, Tyson. - No, I'm taking Davis up in these streets. Baltimore style. All right. All right. I miss you. I miss you, too. How are things at home? It's just one thing after another, you know? And now this money thing. - You should have seen his face. - Mathias? Yeah. You don't think... Nah. Nah, I'm over think in' it. You guys are good now, right? We are. You know, I'd be the first one to tell it like it is. - I do know that. - I go hard for my tribe. He was by your side while you were away, right? - Yeah. - Then men are stupid. Chalk it up to that. That I can do. All right, Joe, y'all come right back over here. Hey, big man, be careful with that, man. That's professional grade equipment. - You got this, you good? - Yes, sir. I don't know. It's got some AARP... Are you serious right now? Am I serious? Y... yeah. I come home to people shuffling things in and out of the house. What the hell is going on? I'm renovating my studio. You don't have a studio. You know the basement's where I work on my music. I'm just making it official. How much is all of this going to cost? I... I don't understand what the big deal is. We can afford it now. When my album comes out, it'll pay for itself with interest. The album you've been working on for the past 10 years? That's the album that's going to cover this? Wow. I didn't mean it like that. Wow. I just meant that we should be smart. And investing in me isn't smart? No! Yes. It is. I just... I wish that we could talk about this kind of stuff first. Yes, ma'am. Is it okay if I go back inside now? Mathias. Do you want me to send it back? No. Look who's back. - Hi! - You look so beautiful. Thank you. How are you? - I'm blessed. - Good. Is he in the back? Yeah. He's back there. You know, my office is all a twitter with you comin' by today. I saw a few people on my way in. Good, good. Well, you look rested. - Do I? - Yeah. I'll take it. I'm glad to see the office is still functioning in my absence. You know, we're about this close to ruin without you but we're survivin', you know? So come on, to what do I owe the pleasure? I am ready. I am ready to come back to work. So soon? Yeah, I mean, I still have my job, right? Of course, come on, you know, we'd love to have you back. Then welcome back? Well, we offered you a year sabbatical. It's only been a couple months. You sure you don't want to take the time? I am sure. Okay. So I'm flirtin' with bein' a little out of line here. But the hospital and your father. Come on, Brooke, that would take its toll on the best of us. I need to feel useful again. What do you mean? I'm starting back up at the firm again. I thought you were on sabbatical. Well, I asked them if I can come back and they said yes. Wait, you asked them? - Yes. - I thought the stress of life, your father being sick and work was what started this whole thing. Well, I can't just hide forever. I need to get back to my life. No. I really need your support on this. Brooke, no. I love you, Mathias. But I am not asking for your permission. I said no. You don't earn, Mathias. Don't make this about me. When you were in the hospital who was there for you? - Me. - And because I couldn't work, we were behind on the bills. - We were behind on mortgage. - Well, we're not anymore. Yeah, and my father only had to die for it to happen. What do you want me to say to that, Brooke, huh? Money is king with you. But is money the only thing that's gonna make you happy? No. Brooke. You're not ready. I start back on Monday whether you think I'm mentally fit or not. Wanna get it between, like, April or March. Oh, March? My birthday is March. Good to have you back, Brooke. Sometimes I wish I never got it. The inheritance? Yeah. It was a gift from your father. If I didn't get the money, that means he'd still be alive and I wouldn't be here. Well, come on. I mean, you know what they say. Money is the answer to 99 out of 100 questions. But see, that's why we should be sure that we're asking the right question. I don't follow. Is it money? Or your husband? Money is a tricky one. - Yeah. - Your friend, Kendra, the one we spoke about last session. You've never had issues with her and money? No, I mean, well, I lent her money a few years ago but she paid it right back. Then, why did you bring it up? Well, she paid most of it back. But she was in between jobs. And I said it was a gift and she still insisted on paying it back. Hmm. I see. We have a good relationship. I'm sure you do. Mm. What are you doing up? - I thought I heard somethin'. - Sorry. Couldn't sleep. Hey. Sorry. Construction is on schedule for the Miller building and things seem to be running smoothly. So there's nothing to report back on that. Good. Thanks, James. So now what else? What else? - Visionary Van... - Ah, Visionary Vanguard. Right. Uh, Monroe, are you there? Yeah, I'm here. Uh, we're going to hold for just a second. Still there? Uh, yeah... Yes. Monroe, are you there? Yes, ma'am. Everything seems to be on track as far as the progress and the, umm... Everything looks good to go. So if anything changes, I'll contact you. So does that mean we're moving to construction next week or what? Uh, let's... let... let... Um, let me verify that and I'll have an answer to you within the hour. Okay. I'll standby. All right. Moving on. Michael, before you say anything, I would like to apologize. There was an issue with my laptop. I took it to IT and they fixed it. - But I know that is no excuse... - Brooke, Brooke. Look, I'm on your side. So if you need a little more time... No, no, that was a one-time thing. All right. One time. Don't beat yourself up, Brooke. Shoot! Yeah, uh, you know, I... I know about the transactions. It's from my husband's studio. He's a musician. That's everyday checking account stuff. Not my concern. There are inquiries of large sums and withdrawals totaling $50,000. $50,000? Normally, I'd make a call, send an email, making sure you're aware. But Reggie wants special attention on your accounts. Are you making those inquiries? The withdraws? Look, either you're doing it. The accounts have been compromised, which is unlikely, or it's your husband. I'll look into it. Are you in need of cash? - Excuse me? - If you are, I could release some funds for your expenditures and restructure the accounts making you the sole holder. Jacob, is it? Yes. I trust my husband. Be that as it may, as your accounts stand, he has full access to all funds. Brooke. Trevor? - How are you? - How are you! I'm good. How... how long has it been? - I don't... 10 years? - 10 years. Wow. We're old. Uh-uh. No. I'm young. - I'm old. - You're old. Got it. How... You headed somewhere? No. Let's walk, catch up. Mm, it was a crazy time. It was a great time. You were... what was it? Wantin' to build artist housing, right? - Yeah, something like that. - Uh-huh. You were, like, gonna take on the government single-handedly, like this new age Black Panther or something? I wasn't that great. More like a Brown Panther. We wanted to change things. Um. So. Uh, you uh, got into politics, right? - Law. - What kind? Criminal defense. You like it? Mm. Yeah. Mm, like Obama now? Yeah! You were too cool for me! That is so juvenile. It doesn't mean it's not true. You were so into that guy, the R&B guy. What ever happened to that guy? Uh... No? You married a crooner? - Oh! - Don't, don't. Okay? The much more adult me has to concede that... your happiness is more important than my fantasy. Fantasy? I mean what I think. Do you? Think. About you? Yes. Regrets, mostly. I should have shot my shot. Who knows what you would have said? At least I'd know. And I could sleep without you dancing around in my head. Thank you so much. For... For making me laugh. I haven't laughed like that in... - I don't know how long. - We can't have that. Can I see you again? Ah. Right. Maybe next lifetime? I promise to be cool. Don't change. Where you been? Uh. Work. So um, you're not upset I had to use the card to pay for studio equipment? I thought that was over. You know, I had to get a few things to make it right. - Mm-hm. - You know, I had an epiphany. I mean, I'm a straight visionary on this. We're throwin' a party. You invite your people, I'll invite mine. Music, drinks, a good time had by all. - I don't know... - No, no, no. I'm not taking no for an answer. I'm gonna make you happy, even if it makes you miserable. Oh, is that a smile? It's workin' already. Hey, Devon. Hey Brookie-Brooke, how are you? I'm good. Mathias is out back. Okay, cool, I'm just waitin' on my girl - to get out of the car. - You left her in the car? Look, y'all need to make up y'all mind. Is it equal rights you want, or not? 'Cause I'm confused. Is this a new one? Because I don't want to pretend I remember her... I mean, I don't... Oh. So y'all already know each other, huh? - No, not really. - Okay. Let me find out. So... - Do you want a drink? - Mm. I mean, you do drink, right? Come on, I am not that uptight. Kidding. Come on. Well, do you think we can not tell anyone about our connection? It's probably best that we keep things separate. Yeah, yeah, of course. - Yeah? - Yeah. Good. Here they come, tighten up. Since this jackass doesn't have any manners... It's like that? Natasha, this is my husband, Mathias. Hello. Kendra. This is Natasha. Natasha, this is Kendra, my best... Oh, you guys talk amongst yourselves. I'll be back. Where'd she go? You promise you can keep this to yourself? And what's that supposed to mean? She's my therapist. Who? Ponytail? - Yeah. - You invited your therapist? No, no, no. She's here with Devon. You need to fire her then. She can't be all that smart. I... I'll be right back. Wow. So, uh. What's that about? You know, it's somethin' I'm workin' on. She came to me. I usually don't like 'em that aggressive, but somethin' about this kinda turned me on. - Not bad at all. - Uh-uh. You hit? All kinds of ways. Word. Nah, I'm lyin'. She's a tough nut to crack. Herself makin' me work for it, I guess. You need help cleaning up? Yeah. Ooh, my. Would you look at the time. - I got a thing. - Yeah, whatever. Are you going to make it to class tomorrow? I don't know... Please do. I need to talk to you about somethin'. Okay. Okay. Bye. Bye. Don't stay up too late. I won't. Oh, my gosh. Uh-huh. You know I hate to admit it. - But you were right. - About what? - The party? - Mm-hm. I tried to tell you. The proper response is thank you. Mm. What's goin' on with this? Stop. I'm filthy. Maybe I like it filthy. I can't... Stop! Stop, Mathias. I'm tellin' you. Something's not right with her. You don't even know her. I know all I need to know. Comin' up in there, poppin' her ass every which way. Sorry about the party. If I knew, I wouldn't have come. It was interesting. Doctor-patient in social situations can be very awkward. How long have you been seein' her? Not too long after I got home. Needed somebody to talk to. You've known her for a long time? Since college. So not that long. So you knew her when you met your husband? Yeah, she introduced us. Are you going to keep seeing her? Why wouldn't I? - You sure she's straight? - Excuse you? I mean, she look a little tricky to me. You would know. I dabbled one time. Forgive me. No, go ahead. She seems to have little faith in people. What kind of therapist shows up at a patient's house? She didn't know. You sure about that? You're overreacting. - Kendra's been hurt. - We've all been hurt. We all carry burden and baggage. But that doesn't give us the right to export that pain onto other people. She doesn't. I'm sure. What does Mathias think about all of this? Why? Have you talked to him about it? Why do you care what Mathias thinks? Just... have you talked? Married people talk, right? You have to protect your borders, Brooke. Some people actively seek out another person's life. Now, they may not be aware that they're doing it but they are, nonetheless. - Talk later? - Yeah. All right, so I'm thinking a little bit more modern, um, maybe more natural lighting. And some harder edges? Oh, give me just a moment. Okay, no problem. You got a second, Brooke? - Yeah. - Okay. So James isn't really working out on the Miller building. - Mm. - Mm. Client's a little agitated so I told him I'll bring one of my aces to close. - You want me on it? - Yeah, is that a problem? No! Okay, good. Good. So. Yeah. I'll handle James. You know, this is one of our bigger accounts and they just a little needy. But uh, what better way to get you back up to speed, huh? - Yeah. - So I can count on you? - Yes. - All right. All right! Hey. You okay? What's wrong? I'm gonna ask you a question. Please, don't do anything but answer it. Who is he? Who... who's who? The man in the picture, the man you're with. - How did you get that? - Who is he? He's no one. You always kiss no one? It's not what it looks like. How did you get that? You lookin' at a picture of you and another man and your response is, "How did I get it?" He is somebody that I knew from years ago. We spoke for a moment. - That's it. - You forgot kissed. - It is not... - What it looks like. I got it. Why did you take me back? Pretend to forgive me. Put me through hell. You did that to us... Don't flip this around on me. You put me through all that just to hurt me? I hope it was worth it. Mathias. You should'a just let me go. I'm sorry. The worst part is I can't get my mind to stop running. You know, it's like one thing gets in there and it just keeps playing over and over again. And I could not stop it. You haven't been given a rest. You should go somewhere alone. But if it's the Caribbean, I'll go with you. I'll give you your space, though. Sometimes I feel like the reason everything's falling apart is 'cause I went to the hospital. You know what I'm sayin'? I took my hand off the wheel. You're putting way too much pressure on yourself. No, I should have been stronger. Brooke. First Mathias cheatin' on you, then losin' a baby, then the job, then your father getting sick. And who knows what else you haven't told me all on you. It was too much. It would have been too much for anyone. Some days are good, you know? Other days it's just like... You can always call me. I know. With you and Natasha's help, I'mma make it through this. Natasha? - Yeah. - Why you listenin' to her? Not this again. I don't know why you think she's on your side like that. I didn't say all that but she has been right about some things. - Like what? - Like the things Mathias does. Don't talk to her about your husband. She's a professional. You have too much faith in people. And maybe you have too little. Let's just not talk about this, okay? And now she's in your head. This is Brooke. Hey, it's Natasha. Hey, Dr. Clay. You canceled your appointment. Is everything okay? Yeah, uh, work's just been crazy but I'll make the next session. You sure? Yeah. You have to put yourself first, Brooke. I know. Are you sure you can't come by? Look, the spot is still open. Next session. Okay. Brooke? Would you like me to get you some water? Oh, no. Uh, what were you saying on the voice-mail? There's been more of the same activity, this time totaling $75,000. I'm assuming that wasn't you, as well. Can you print this out for me? So... so, I... I can see what's going on? Yeah, sure. What's up? Can you meet me? Hello? I'm worried about her. She's acting like before. Brooke is fine. She's just got a lot on her plate. No, it's... it's not that. She's like my sister. I think we're past the point of you and her being sisters. I'm not going to stand by and watch you put her in the hospital again. I put her in the hospital? - Who else? - What about you? Hm? Where were you? I don't care what you think about me. You don't want to know what I think about you. Oh, I know exactly how you feel about me. She has to believe that you're protecting her. I know you're not man enough for the job. But she has to believe that. So um, I'm supposed to protect her from the guy she's seeing? Oh. You didn't know about that, did you? Don't feel bad. Neither did I. So what you going to do about it, sis in law, huh? Hmm? You see, you stick your nose in everybody's business and then just stand back like your hands are clean. We both know they're not. You see, we both know that you live in a glass house. I can't make one mistake? You tell me. You can sure as hell call me out. But what about you? We are not the same. We are exactly the same. - I'm leaving him. - Math... - Your husband? - Yeah. I don't know who to trust. When I'm around him, I don't even know if I trust myself. I saw him with another woman. Did you know this woman? I'm only asking because I know you've had issues with his infidelity in the past. Was it the same woman? No. But you do know this woman. - Yeah. - Was she a friend? Brooke... Have you ever heard of Othello syndrome? - No. - It's also known as pathological or morbid jealousy. It's when a person is so consumed by their insecurities that they become jealous. Usually of a spouse or a friend. What are you saying? Well, other than your father's passing, your life was turning for the better. You were repairing your marriage. You returned back to work at a prestigious firm. You gained financial independence. Your friend, Kendra. She doesn't have any of that. Does she? See, normally when this disorder takes hold of a person, any good falling on the subject of their jealousy feels like an injustice... a personal attack. She may be actively trying to destroy everything that you've built. So, you decided to come home. I spoke with the financial advisor and he said there's been some activities in the account. Sounds like you meant to say your accounts. Is there something you want to tell me? You went to the financial adviser without me. He said there's been withdraws of $50,000 and $75,000. And you think that was me? Who else? I think what's happening is familiar. Before your stay at the hospital, you accused me of trying to sell our house. Was that true? Brooke. Was that true? No. I think you need to get some rest. When you feel better, you and I can go to the financial adviser together and get to the bottom of this. You're not gon' make me think I'm crazy. Oh, you're not crazy. You just trying to make me forget about those pictures? Where were you last night? - Good night. - Where were you? I was here in our bed. You were not. So where were you? Right. I guess I'll just wait for pictures on that, too. So this is the new version. I implemented all of your changes so you just need to let me know if this was a bit more of what you were expecting. I warmed it up a little... Brooke? Yeah. That's it. Oh, uh, can you excuse me for just a minute? I think she's going to like it. I am so sorry to disturb you at work. I... I just felt this couldn't wait to our next session. - What is it? - I just got a call from your friend, Kendra. What do you mean a call? She was quite upset. She suggested that I was manipulating you and that she'd prefer if I stopped seeing you. Only not that elegant. I am so sorry about this. Can I take my doctor's hat off for a second? Yeah. I mentioned your husband and she became unraveled. I just thought you should know that from one woman to another. Are you crazy? Brooke. You need to slow down. Did you call Natasha? What? Who told you that? How dare you. She told you that? How dare you! I am telling you as nicely as I can to stay away from me. I mean it. It's like I'm back in grade school again, all over again. - It's tough. - Yeah. - Excuse me? - Shut up. I need to talk to you. This isn't helping my anxiety, doctor! I... I'm so sorry, please, allow me to take care of this. I promise, I'll have you re-scheduled. Get a cup of coffee. Get the hell out. Move! You may have Brooke fooled but with me, you got a problem. I have no idea what you're talking about. When I slap that bun off the top of your head, you'll know exactly what I'm talking about. You're acting like a crazy person. Here. Take my card. Kendra, do you know what projection is? If you say one more word, I'm going to project myself all over that ass. You stay away from her husband. Is this about Brooke? Or Mathias? Stay away from her. I'm not sure how things are done where you're from, but you don't barge into a person's place of business and threaten them. I just did. Now what? Hey. Hey, Jacob. Excuse me? Can you stop? How'd you get past reception? My uncle runs this place. Yeah, well, you just got the front desk woman fired if I have anything to do with it. Okay, can you stop for a second? What is going on? You're not picking up my phone calls. I don't know what game you're playing but I was trying to help you. Uh, slow down. What are you talking about? A letter signed by you, sent to Reggie saying I was an obstruction to your access to funds. And implying I was siphoning money from your accounts. I could lose my license. I never wrote any letter. Yeah? How about you find out who did? How about you let me in your office before I pull every dime from your care? Right this way. I didn't send any letter. What am I going to do about Mathias stealing from me? When you open the accounts, you gave him full access. I can't deny him what's legally his. So what then? I could put a freeze on the accounts. No one, including you, would have access to them and buy you time to restructure or close them and open new ones. But a letter from him or a lawyer can overturn that. So for now, no one will have access to the funds. For now, yes. Do it. You should know, we've received a call asking about the protocol if you're no longer mentally fit to manage your finances. And what's the protocol? If you're declared mentally unfit... he gets power of attorney over it all. God. Brooke? I'm here. Are you okay? Your voice sounds faint. I'm worried about you. I think you should come in. Why? Why are you worried about me? Come in. I won't be coming in any more. I don't think that's a wise decision, Brooke. I miss my father. Where are you? I'll come to you. I want you out of this house. Brooke. Now. Hi. I know you're not speaking to me, but... We're clear. Copy that. All right, so you can skip the nine o'clock staff meeting so you can be ready for the clients at 10. - Okay. Okay. - You need some help with that? - Oh, no, no, no. I got it. - Okay. So, like I said, this is a really big account. And I need you to get them to start writing checks again. - Yes. - Writing checks. - Okay. - Checks pay the bills. I got it. I got it. Come on. Ring. Dammit. Hey! Come on! Please! - Hello? - You got a sec? - Yeah. - We've received a letter. Uh, about the freeze? It's requesting a hold on your account whiles there's an investigation into your mental fitness. What? Hey, we're waiting. Come on. Oh, okay. Are you there? Yeah, Jacob, I'm going to have to call you back. Build with confidence. Modern timeless. Be above the fray. Built with D&P Life Designs. Our concept for the Miller building is modern without compromising your individuality. We know how much emphasis you put on being green. Our plans will allow for the building to run 92% solar and renewable energy. And... Oh. I'm sorry. Okay. Uh. I think what Brooke is working to do... I actually have it on an empty thumb drive. I just need to switch laptops. Okay, well, in the interim... Can you just give me a moment? - My apologies... - Please don't do this to me. Uh, little technical difficulty right now, right? But while Brooke is working to get the presentation back up, let's talk about some of the features you can expect. Brooke! Look, I think you need to take the rest of the day, as a matter of fact, you take the rest of the week off. You go home, get some rest and come back Monday, we'll chat. Are you firing me? I'm trying my damnedest not to. Go home, get some rest, hm? We'll talk on Monday. What... what are you looking at! You need to mind your own business. You have a collect call from the Maryland correctional facility. Press one to accept. Yeah, who is this? This is Kendra. You don't know me. I've read about your case online and I wanted to talk to you about someone you knew. I ain't got nothin' but time. Do you know a Natasha Clay? - No, I don't know her. - I think it's the same person as Monique Haynes. Her, I do know. What can you tell me about her? Stay away from her. You hear me? She's crazy. How do you know her? I had an affair with her. She's a psycho. Every man says the woman they cheated with is a psycho. Yeah, you sound just like them. Go on. It got crazy so I ended it. And? She threatened to kill me, my wife. Thought she was just talking. I read your report online and your fingerprints are all over the knife. And you had motive. I gotta go. Wait. I'm sorry. Please talk to me. You see that blond hair, run. Hi. How did you get in my house? I looked under the welcome mat and the ridge of the door. Couldn't find a spare so, I broke in. Popcorn? What? You can sit there like the godfather all you want but it's too late. - I know who you are. - I know. You've been asking around about me. I have, Monique. Well, I've had so many names. Sometimes it's hard for me to remember what my real name... My government name is Lauren. Ugh. I don't care what you call yourself. I know all about you. Your license. That guy you set up that's rotting in jail. - Dupree. - Shut up, you psycho! Please don't call me that. You killed his wife. I stabbed her. The loss of blood killed her. I'm gonna expose you. I never did like you. I didn't like you, first. You know what? Stand up. You picked the wrong one. You want me to stand? Wait. This beat down is inevitable. Look, I know you haven't asked for my advice. But, between you and I, you should probably keep a lock on your gun case. And you shouldn't hide it in the closet, sweetie. That's the first place an intruder would look. Hi. May I speak with Brooke, please? - This is her. - Hi, Brooke. This is Detective Wright with Metro Homicide. How are you? So I was wondering if it was possible if you could come down to the station so we could talk. It's about your friend, Kendra. Here you go? - How you feeling? - How's Kendra? I just talked to the hospital and they have her listed as critical. Hey. It's a good sign. The reason why I called you in. Her cell shows, the last three calls she made went unanswered by you. Was she family or a friend? Both. Brooke, I need your help here. Can you think of anyone who would want to do this to her? Can we go home? Brooke. You okay? I'm sorry. I'm sorry. Hi. I know you're not speaking to me. But I want to say I'm sorry. I should have visited you in the hospital but I was so caught up in my own and you're... You're too good of a person to tell me how much that hurt. I should have been there for you when you needed me. Don't be mad at me but I've done some digging and I sent what I've found so far to your email. Brooke, please. Read it. Why here? Oh, you think this will cause me to not make a scene? I will ride you on this tape and you know I will. We have to talk. Talking's never been our strength. Did you do that to Kendra? - Do what? - She was shot. That's terrible. Did she stick her nose in the wrong person's business? Yeah, she did. Sounds like she got what she deserved. Oh, I scheduled a meeting with your financial advisors and your lawyers on your behalf. I told you not to do that. And I told you not to send that letter about Brooke's mental health. Come on. I'm an independent woman. Stop. Hey, we're almost there. You go to the meeting. Brooke spins out of control and then it's done. We're off to Paris just like we planned. There's not going to be a meeting. Oh, there very much better be a meeting. Natasha! Natasha, stop it. Are you crazy? Coming to my house? Please don't call me crazy. I just wanted to see how you lived when you weren't returning my calls. I'm impressed. You know, I may have led you on. I don't care anymore. I wasn't going to leave my wife. Not for you. I can't believe I let you manipulate me in doing what I did. Oh, please, man. Grow up. I just gave you a treat and you came running like the little useless dog that you are. We both knew exactly what we were doing. Yeah. But I will never be able to live with what I did to her. You feel sorry for her? I feel sorry for her. Look at you. You're up here crying to the woman that you're sleeping with about your wife! What kind of sick, depraved mommy issues do you have? There is a basic piece of decency that you don't have. There is nothing in you capable or deserving of redemption. You are not just going to sleep with me and then toss me aside. Actually, that's exactly what I'm going to do. Because that's all you deserve. If I catch you near her, I'll kill you myself. So you're chivalrous now, Mathias? You're her knight in shining armor? You're weak! A boy in man's clothes. - Hey! - Shut up. What the hell is going on here? She's gone. - Brooke. - Detective Wright? Let me put you on speaker. Hold on. Detective, I sent you an email with all the information you need to know about Natasha Clay. Where did you get all this? My friend. How's Kendra? She's in critical condition. How are you? This house has gotten so quiet. It used to be so alive. That was the past. We had some great times, didn't we? Yeah. But now? I have something to tell you. Please. Please don't. I really can't take anymore. I've done some terrible things... things that if someone told me they did to a stranger, I'd think you must hate them. Whatever you feel you need to tell me... I don't need to know. I already know. I know in my heart. You left me vulnerable to the world. I trusted you. I trusted you when nobody thought I should. Did you do that to Kendra? No. But I know who did. Natasha. Did you have an affair with her? Yes. Were there others? Yeah. Why? All this pain. For what? I've lost you, haven't I? Yeah. I owe you so much. I do love you. I was just weak. Let me know when you won't be around, I'll... I'll come by and get my things. You expecting someone? No. Inside. What? Hello, love birds. Oh, look at you. You're such a gentleman. What are you doing? I came to kill her, silly. I couldn't kill you 'till after I took control of the money. You can plan a cookout but you can't predict the weather. You don't want to kill anybody. I didn't drive all this way for nothin'. Can you put the gun down? You think I won't shoot you, Mathias? I've already shot you 10 times in my head. Natasha. I'm sorry. Everybody is sorry with a gun in their face. Yes. We're both adults. But I led you to believe things that weren't true. I mistreated you. Please. I'm sorry. No. No, no, no, no. Mathias, please Mathias. Mathias, please baby, hold on, hold on. Hey! - Back up. - Please, please. I told you you were weak. Please! Please don't. For him? Don't you know what they are? They want you to be the sexual being so they can have their fun. And then they treat you like trash. Worse than trash. They're all the same. All of 'em. The better you are. The worse they are, it's... I'm doing you a favor. But you don't understand. No one understands. Because you don't understand... You don't deserve it. Ah! Now we do have a unit that's a little larger that's not too far from here. But this... This is 2,600 square feet. So what was it that you were looking for? I'm opening an architecture firm. How exciting. Congratulations. Thank you. We do have the classic wood flooring and decor and you can't beat that you're in the heart of the city. - I'll take it! - Wonderful. Yo, this is about to... Really hurt some people's feelings, so... If you a little sensitive you might as well turn this joint off right now, okay?
