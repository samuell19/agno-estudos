- Thank you. - You're welcome. Razak. This is for you. This is from me. - Thank you. - Smart boy. (Ferry) New year. New fortune. New spirit. You should've persuaded Babah yesterday. This is uncomfortable. What do you mean by that? We should've celebrated Lunar New Year at my house. Everything will be taken care of. You guys just need to be present. Why are you nagging? Babah's nagging is enough. Don't nag too. You'll get your menopause soon! You! Touch wood. Anyway, Babah just wants to gather with his family. Once he wants something, who can refuse? He'll nag. Bring it here. I just don't want to trouble you. This is troublesome. I have to bring food here. Lina has to do so too. See? Only our family members are here, but this house is already so crowded. Can you imagine what if I bring my 5 maids? Gosh. This house might explode. - Understand? - I know my house isn't as big as yours. But you don't have to say it out loud. It's going to be troublesome if Reza hears that. This whole family is sensitive. Such a headache. Hi! Umi, I got angpao from Uncle Vincent and Uncle Ferry. Wow! You must have a lot of savings now. Once I have enough, I can buy PlayStation, right? Of course. Have you said thank you, though? I have. Good job. Now go play with your cousins. Since when has he started calling you Umi? What does Umi even mean? Mom, in Arabic. Why don't you just use neutral term? Huh? We are all immigrants here. Why does it have to be Umi? We live in Indonesia. We should just be Indonesian. Why is the food I ordered not here? It's still in the car. We'll take it out soon. Should we do it now? Let's go. Be careful of your blood pressure. What did he order? Pork? Gosh. My husband won't like it when he finds out. Darling, I'm sorry. I don't intend to make you uncomfortable. But pork is delicious - What can I do? - Angela, where is Reza? He's on the terrace. Please tell him to come here. Okay. - This is for you guys. Please eat. - Okay. - Reza, you're here. - Hey, Ferry. Let's go. Everyone is inside. My head hurts. I know this is not your new year. I understand. But we are family. Just join us. I know, but my head hurts a little. It's so noisy. Well, it's the usual. Gong xi gong xi angpao na lai. (t/n: Congratulations, give me the angpao) That's exactly what makes my head hurt. So we have to wait for Reza to start eating? The host should be present to invite us to eat. Be patient, will you? He will come soon. That's the proper etiquette. But this? The host isn't even here. Enough. I'll get him. Wave your hands. Hello! Why are you like this? My family has gathered at home to eat together. Why are you here instead? Let's go back. Why don't they eat first? This is your family's new year. What? My family? Are you saying they're not your family? Sorry, that's not what I meant. I just want all of you to have more privacy. Anyway, it's useless for me to be there. What should I even do? Probably just staying quiet, smiling and listening to your in-law's achievements. Going to America, Europe. What can I even talk about? Majalengka? Enough. Please don't go off-topic. Please? This is a family event. I just don't want Babah to get offended and angry. Just that. Isn't there always something to offend and make him angry every d-- Hey. I'm aware of my family's weakness. But you don't have to be that salty. You're aware of how your Umi acts towards me, right? You think I'm not hurt? But I'm never salty like you. Everyone is already here. Here. Stay with Umi first. okay? Excuse me. Reza, let's start eating. - We're hungry. - Please eat. Sorry I'm late. Sorry, I started eating before the host. Once again I apologize for joining late. Razak demanded to watch the lion dance at the vihara. Hey! You were the one who told me to watch. Never teach children to lie. That's bad. Reza, eat the kuotie. Your wife made my favourite. Don't eat this one, though. It's not halal. Okay. The tea may not be halal either. The business owner isn't necessarily a Muslim. Here, angpao from auntie and uncle. Save it. Wow, thank you. Thank you. Only 50 thousand? Earlier I got 100 thousand from Akong. Aldo! You can't say that. Apologize to auntie and uncle! It's okay. He's still a kid. That's right, Aldo. You are being ungrateful. So noisy. Stop trying to act mature. Aldo, I've never taught you to do that! Let him be. That's a child's honest expression. That's why you shouldn't lie in front of children. Tell your husband, too. When we're gathering like this, stop being constantly on the phone. Turn off the phone, if necessary. So weird. Why is he treating his phone like God? (Andrea) Who are you talking to? Everyone is inside. (Andrea) Go in now. Babah is angry. We only do family gathering once a year. Only for a few hours too. Sorry, Babah. The minister called me. Duty calls. You know I have to go to Israel tomorrow. Is pork that disgusting for Muslim? Very. The law is written in Quran. Is there a reason why pork is considered haram? I don't know exactly. What I'm sure of is pork is haram. Including everything that touches it? What do you mean? Look at yourself. Is washing them with soap not enough? Do you have to wash them with soil too? So. I am just using my logic. Even for dogs that are better accepted in society, if we touch even just the tip of their nose, we have to clean our body with soil, at least 7 times. Let alone pigs. Does that mean Babah's intestines must be washed with soil? See? Why are you so stubborn? This is a matter of belief. Every religion has their own rules. Pork is haram. Period. Fine, don't get mad. I was only asking. I'm not mad. But your questions seem to intimidate me. I thought it's only Babah who enjoys cornering me. Now you do the same thing too. Fine. Sorry for making you feel that way. I was honestly only asking. I'm a convert. There are still a lot of things I don't know about Islam. You should guide me instead of getting infuriated. I apologize. I've been in a foul mood the whole day. Therefore I sounded like I was mad at you. You're so adorable when you're angry. You're so cheesy. - Really. - Stop with the cheese. I am ugly, - fussy-- - And then? always nagging, allergic to many things, and also-- Oops. I'm leaving. No. No. No. Forgive me! Sorry! No! Babe. Stop. Stop. Babe! I thought social media could function as public clinic. As a tool to make people's minds healthier. But ever since I started working here, my mind has only been getting more chaotic. Imagine. Hoax, gossips, even slanders are created here. Everything has diverted from its original function. - All data is inside. - Noted. What's worse, though, we are now part of it all. This office is getting worse. It seems like our current editor in chief doesn't understand the media's vision and mission at all. That's what I find unbelievable. In this age, even the smartest people can turn into fools. Stop. Stop. Practice first. You're out of tune! Sorry. No one died yet. You understand, don't you? Babah. If I may ask, why don't you just stay at the house of your son-in-law, the businessman? It must be more comfortable there. In plain view, you're right. A luxurious home, with a pool. He even has 5 maids! The beds are soft. Everything I want is available. Then what's the problem? I just can't stand it. The house is big, yet very quiet. Both the husband and wife work. But your grandson is there. My grandson is too absorbed. He never leaves his room. He's on his computer all the time. And the security guard would always ask me, "Where are you going?" What about your second daughter? They're even richer. The house is bigger. They even have a tennis court. - That's awesome. - Not at all. I have to walk very far just to take some water from the kitchen. Up and down the stairs, too. Then what makes you love staying here? Because you guys are here. Hanging out with an elderly. Being reminded of death when you look that way. Reza, Mr. Zairin is asking for you. - Now? - Yes, now. He's waiting in his room. - Okay, thanks. - You're welcome. - Excuse me, Sir. - Please come in, Reza. Can I help you, Sir? Sit down. "My Angel" Just do your work and follow the rules I've made. Sorry, Sir. The visual changes I made yesterday could give the impression that this event really occurred when in reality it's still a rumor. We could lead the public opinion towards slander, and that's harmful. What do you know about media business? This is an industry. Our morale is based on the market. Everything is decided by the market. The hell with idealism. I'm sorry, Sir. But this has deviated from the function of media. To be honest, I object. Enough. Starting from tomorrow, you'll move to data archiving department. You're lucky I'm not firing you. You don't have to pretend to be nice. I'm resigning. Please, go ahead. Okay. I'm not willing to work with a clown who only pretends to be a genius like you. HRD! Babah. I need to go to the clinic. My allergy suddenly comes back. And also.. Do you have some cash? I need to borrow some. I haven't had the time to go to the ATM yet. I do. Wait a minute. - Thank you. - Okay. Please wait! Assalamualaikum. Wa'alaikumsalam, Mr. Yusuf. Our rent is due, isn't it? That's right. Can I ask for a week? I'll definitely pay. Of course. It's not a problem. You can pay me later. The most important thing is that your whole family is healthy. "Missed call: My Angel" You're suffering from follicullitis. There is an inflammation on your head follicles. This condition causes the itch and stinging on your head. If you leave it untreated, it can cause baldness. Here. I'm writing you a prescription; an ointment to treat your inflammation. For now, avoid wearing any head cover to prevent humidity and sweating. And also, avoid direct sunlight. Nurse! Wow, this is fun. Very fun. Since when have they started getting along? This is different from what I see on TV. Usually, people of different religions fight. Even those believing in the same religion fight, let alone different ones. Ever since I was a kid, people in this area have always been getting along. How is that possible? I just realized that too. This is just my assumption. The religious leaders here have the right understanding. So they're able to teach their followers the right way. Even the policemen don't pass by here often. We have intel, though. See? Even monkey can be taught. See? - Worshipping God. - You're right. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Shalom. Akong, there's a dog. Let me down. I feel bad for him. Let's take him home and feed him. We can, right? Why is there a dog in this house? Who brought it home? Dog? How do I know? There's obviously a dog outside. It must be Babah, right? Doesn't he know that dogs are highly unaccepted by Muslims? Of course he doesn't. He isn't a Muslim. Anyway, you should ask Babah first. Don't accuse without proof. Where did you go earlier? I called all day but you didn't pick up at all. You didn't even realize that there's dog in this house. I should be the one asking. You didn't pick up my call nor reply to my messages. I didn't pick up once and now you're mad at me? I had to go to the doctor earlier. My allergy suddenly comes back. It's very itchy. Fortunately, Babah was there to take care of Razak. And I certainly needed my husband earlier. Mr. Yusuf came earlier. I've asked for one more week extension for the rent payment. Oh. Umi invited us to her house tomorrow night. For dinner. Do I have to go? Of course. This is Umi. She's your family too. I should've been more patient yesterday. At least until pay day. I need a lot of money for many things, especially for my household. Should I sell my car? I don't advise you selling it. A car may help you find a job. You can also make use of your car, like renting it out to online taxi services maybe? If you don't care about pride, you can even be the driver yourself. Abi. Darling. this is your coffee. Thank God. Thank you. Assalamualaikum. Wa'alaikumsalam warahmatullahi wabarakatuh. - Abi. - Reza. - How are you? - Thank God, I'm fine. - Angela, how are you? - I'm fine, Abi. - Are you doing well? - I am. Umi, Reza and Angela have arrived. - Please go in. - Okay, Abi. I'm gonna have a chat with Omar first. - Assalamualaikum. - Wa'alaikumsalam. - How are you? - I'm fine, Umi. What is this? Wow, my favorite Egyptian martabak. Thank you. Please sit. You know my favorite. Sumi. Please serve it on a plate. Angela. You're so pretty tonight. If you wear hijab, you'll certainly look prettier. Where is the hijab I gave you? You never wear it, do you? Abi! Omar! -Yes? - Come in now. Everyone is waiting. Let's go. Oh, when I went to Dubai, I bought all of you hijab. They're very pretty. Please wear them on my birthday. All of you will be very beautiful. I'm so proud of having such beautiful daughter and daughter-in-laws. Thank you, Umi. We'll definitely wear them. Coincidentally I am currently wearing the hijab you bought me in Egypt. - Isn't it beautiful? - Of course. A woman's beauty radiates more when she wears hijab. These days hijab comes in various pretty styles too. It's easy to find. And cheap too. By the way, Angela. You have a husband already. In our religion, a wife's beauty is only presented to her husband, not other men. Umi. Where is the martabak? Talking about Angela, Umi's words are right. But if God is willing, He'll make a way for everything. - Right, Reza? - Yes, Abi. Angela currently has an acute infection on her scalp. She just visited the doctor yesterday. Right, babe? That's why when you pray, don't forget to ask God for healing. Especially if your intention is to wear hijab, He will definitely heal you soon. By the way, both of you pray right? Damn you! Why are you acting like you never drive in Jakarta? You know that all motorcycle riders are like that. Can't you be more patient? Patient? Are you telling me to be patient? What kind of patience are we talking about? You-facing-Umi-with-a-cynical-face kind of patience? Cynical? I dealt with your Umi's nagging just fine. You don't have to pretend. It's all written on your face. You don't like her telling you to wear hijab, do you? Okay, so. You should be more patient facing Umi. Don't do what you did earlier. You kept silent and didn't smile at all throughout dinner. The atmosphere was so bad. I was the one who caused that? It was your Umi! She knew about my allergy. But all she could talk about was hijab and covering my body. As if we have nothing else to talk about. I'm sick of it. Fine. Is it wrong if she asks you to wear hijab? You know it yourself. Umi has always been that way. So now you should be able to deal with her with more patience. How much more patient should I be? Like how patient you are when dealing with Babah? See? You're off-topic. This is not about me and Babah, but your attitude towards Umi! That's the problem. Can't we have comparisons in life? Selfish. You are the selfish one. You heard what Umi said yourself. She cares about you! But how do you repay her? You've never worn the hijab she gave you even once. What's so difficult about wearing it once in a while when you meet her? At least you can make her happy. I don't care about my scalp allergy. If I decide to wear hijab, it won't be because of her. Not because of you. Not because of anyone. I want to wear hijab out of my conscience. I don't want to be fake. Or do you want me to be fake like others? Do you want me to wear hijab because of family demands? Just because of fashion? Wearing hijab but not caring about my actions? Okay. I appreciate that. - But at least-- - Enough! I don't want to argue with you any longer. One thing you should know, though. The reason why I converted to your religion was because I believed that Islam never taught us to be fake. I thought you knew me! So what should I do? What do you mean? What should I do to know you? Okay. First thing to do, you can't sleep with me tonight. Why are you here so early? I want to check whether there's a room available. What for? I want to rent. - Seriously? - Seriously. It looks like you're having a problem at home. I'll tell you later. - Can I see the room? - There's one there. How much is the rent? Don't worry about it. - I'm being serious here. - Me too. Just see the room first. This one. - I'm leaving, Ray. - Okay. - Morning. - Hello, Hidayat. It seems like I'm getting a new neighbor. Yes. Wait a second. Rez! - Hm? - Your soon-to-be neighbor. - Hi. - Hello. - Soraya. - Reza. The back door is connected, right? Yes, the key is next to it. - I'm going to university now. - Bye. Yud! Tell Anton that the fence isn't welded yet. - Babah, please towel him dry. - Okay. Hello? Angela, my dear. This week is Babah's turn to stay at my home. Talk to him yourself. Babah. Andrea. Okay. Hello, Babah. The driver will pick you up later. No need. I'll go there next week instead. Last night your sister fought with her husband. And Reza hasn't come home since last night. - Oh, I see. - I'll stay here for now. "I'm not a passenger of life.. I'm the captain who decides the direction of my family's life" Sorry. Have you waited for a long time? That's fine. The florist wasn't fair. I came first but she served me later. She smiled to others yet she was so afraid of me. But, it's fine. The most important thing is that I've got this pretty flower. Okay, let's go now. Okay. - If I may ask-- - Yes? Who is that pretty flower for? For my wife, of course. My wife loves pretty flowers. Although she is actually prettier than this flower. How many children do you have? I have 8. 8? Yeah. They're so manly, and the girls are pretty like their mom. Wow. Where does your wife come from? My wife is from China. "My Angel" She has such a beautiful face. I can't possibly do-- I know, but it's not possible for me to-- You've told me. I told you I just wanted to celebrate with my friends. You don't have to swear at me. Stop. Enough. You can call me whatever you want. You can say I bite the hand that feeds me. It's up to you! I can't change this plan! Period. Praise the Lord! I've told you not to disturb me anymore! Damn you. Sorry for being noisy. It's fine. Don't worry. Did you just finish your class? No, I just had something to take care of. I see. Bachelor's? Master's. Master's? Wow. Amazing. Which major? Clinical Psychology. Clinical Psychology. So does that mean you often deal with people with mental issues? Like--I'm sorry--crazy people? Well, yes. By the way, it seems like you know a bit about this field. I've read a bit. Did you go to college? Me? I did, but only for Bachelor's degree. If I may ask, what makes you interested in learning about psychiatric issues? I like it. It's interesting to learn about various human's psychology. But ironically, it seems like I'm not able to learn about my self. Gosh. That's heavy. - Please. - Hey. So I've been talking to you all this time. It's a coincidence. So now I don't have to bother booking online taxi anymore? Anytime. I'll take you whenever I'm available. Well, I'll go now. Have a good rest. Okay. You too be careful. Got it. Thank you. If I tell Angela, she'll certainly say no. She is always afraid of her husband. You try to talk to her. Maybe your sister will listen to you. No, no need. I still have some money. I actually wanted to use that money to renovate your mother's grave. But that's not urgent. If you really want to give, give it to your sister instead. Okay. - Babah. - Hm? Where is your son-in-law, Razak's father? I rarely see him. I heard he has a job out of town. Good evening, Lae Boro. Shalom, Jabong. I have a message from the neighborhood leader. You haven't paid for 3 months. Give me one more week. No one has died yet. Oh please. I'll get going now. Good evening. Thank you. - Hey. - Hm? When you go to church later, pray! Ask! Ask for whatever you need. Are you telling me to ask for many people to die? Not that. Ask for fortune! Well, my fortune comes from dead people. That's true. If no one dies, Boro and his family will die instead. Gosh. "My husband: The night pauses for a moment. Giving time for my longing to pass.." This morning Ferry left a message for you. He asked whether you wanted to work at his office. Thank you so much, Lina. But, I can't decide now. I have to discuss this with Reza first. He once told me as long as he's healthy and not sick, I shouldn't work. Fine. Think about it first. Don't take too long though. Okay, let's talk later. I'm in a rush. Razak is leaving for school. Thank you. Come on, let's go. "My Angel" I want a divorce. Hey! I want a divorce! Divorce! How can I possibly divorce you? I'm a marriage officiant. My job every day is to officiate weddings. Does that mean a marriage officiant can't divorce? - They can. - Then let's divorce! But I'm embarrassed. I am ashamed to face God. Ashamed to face God? You should be ashamed to face your wife! Me! We have to get a divorce! "Do not let the sun go down while you are still angry" - Hello, Reza. - Hello, Ray. Here, catch this. Wow. Thank you. There is something I want to talk to you about. Please wait for me! I'll put this away first. Okay. What do you want to talk about? So, tomorrow I have an event in Bogor, friends gathering. We're celebrating our Master's degree graduation. Congratulations. Thank you. The thing is I don't know what time the event will end. Do you think you can pick me up? I'm afraid of traveling alone at night. Okay, I can. Did you get any news from Reza? Not yet, Bah. Weird. I can't believe he can be so indifferent. Let's not talk about him anymore. - As if we don't have anything else to talk about. - Okay, okay. I want to talk about something else then. Do you have any money? Why? Do you need some? No. What I meant was if you don't have any, I have some. I still have some savings. You can use that for your daily needs first. There's no need. I have enough for my daily needs. But what about the rent? How did you find out about that? I overheard it when Mr. Yusuf came here. "Pawnshop" - I want to sue this company. - Understood. How could he create such hoax? Who does he think he is? Good afternoon. Good afternoon. How may I help you? I want to meet Reza. May I? Oh, I'm sorry. Reza no longer works here. Thank you. Now I understand why he is sensitive and gets easily irritated these days. He must be so stressed. He just got fired when we have a lot of needs in our household. I should've been a more patient wife who can be by his side. I feel bad for him. - Hey. - Hi. Come. Where? Sit there. Just follow her. But this wasn't my plan today. This is mine. You aren't allowed to complain. I want to give you a makeover. Because basically you're really pretty. Listen to her. We consider your original plan as completed. Right, Andrea? So just listen to us. You're going to start working tomorrow, anyway. You should look amazing. It's paid. Reza paid for it. Via money transfer. Oh, it's paid? Okay then. If you'll excuse me. Bye. - Bye, Andrea. - Bye. Check your account later. I sent you some money. You don't need to. Andrea has sent me some. Stop that. It's a gift for you since you look amazing now. Look at you. So different from how you looked when you came, right? You should shop after this. Buy some outfits for work tomorrow. Okay? Thank you. "Transaction Status: Success. From Reza to Angela. 2 million." I just got a divorce. Officially. My husband is gay. - Voila! - Wow! Thank you, Umi. The tableware is all here. You can turn on the stove like usual. You have to wipe this area daily. If the dust piles up, Razak will cough. And then.. This is Razak's breakfast box. I usually put in some bread and jam. He usually showers at 5 pm and every morning. Oh, it's been paid? Hello, Babah! Boro! - I heard you asked for me. - I did. What's up? I need to leave Dewa with you. Why? No one can take care of him. - Is that the case? - Yes. - Here. Some money. - Huh? Please feed him well. Alright. I received some blessings through Dewa. I'll visit later. Alright. Thank you, Babah. Thank you, God! 100 thousand! "Only smile can dispel anger.. Only sincerity can restore intimacy." Hello, Ray? Where are you? I've been at the parking lot for a while. Why didn't you tell me? I didn't want to disturb you. Just come in. Come in here. I'll just stay here. It's okay. Please, Reza. I have difficulty walking. Okay? My head hurts badly. Fetch me here. I can't really walk. Alright. One more. Another one. "My Husband" Calling your wife? You don't have to be surprised. I know you have a wife. Why? Are you having a problem? You have a child and a wife, live in Jakarta, but you rent a room somewhere else. It's easy to guess. I know a bit about you from Hidayat. What did he say about me? I was the one who asked about you more. Why? Do I have to have a reason? I don't understand why people always demand for a reason. Well.. As a practical standard of living, maybe? I agree with that for certain things. For simpler things, though, that theory surely collapses. Okay. May I know why? Here, this is simple. I'll ask you something. Do you love your wife? Yes. Very. Why? Or what is the reason? I don't know. Yes, that's the most correct answer. Loving someone without a reason. That's honest. Okay. I have a second question. Why did you leave your wife? Okay. It's fine if you don't want to answer. But there must be a reason, whatever that is. I don't know what to say. I don't know. I just feel judged here. I'm so sorry. You know I'm drunk. Okay, okay. I'm just kidding. It's okay. Okay. Wait. Are you okay? Slowly. We're almost there. Reza. I won't mind if you want to stay the night in my room. Thanks. It's late. It's better if both of us just retire for the night. You're a good husband. I like it. Good night. Night. What are you doing there? I was waiting for you. Anything important? Your wife came to the office today. Please meet Angela Tanujaya. My sister-in-law. If possible, let her work starting from tomorrow. Angela. This is Mr. Sorga. He will train you today with some other people. Thank you. No worries. Welcome to my office. Good luck. "Reza: I miss you" "Angela: I miss you more" "Reza: Can I call you?" "Angela: I don't want to talk on the phone" "Reza: So when can I call you" "Angela: If you still love us, come home" "Reza: Yes, I will go home tonight" Excuse me. I have a message from Ferry. He said you can bring the laptop home. - Oh? - It's a present for you. Thank you. - Good luck. - Thank you. Hi! Hi, Babah. Wow, you're having so much fun. Have you showered? Mira! - Yes, Ma'am? - Has Razak showered? I'm sorry, Ma'am. He refused. Razak, go shower first. Babah, scold him when he loses track of time. He's still a kid. He won't pay attention to anything else when he's playing. By the way, why is there still no news from Reza? He contacted me earlier. He told me he'd come home tonight. That's good then. He realizes that his wife and son are here. I'm begging you, though. Just for tonight please don't nag at him. Oh, so is that how I am in your eyes? No, that's not what I mean. I just want tonight to be peaceful. I'm always peaceful. You guys are the noisy ones, fighting every day. Fine. Then tonight Razak should sleep in my room. So that if you guys are "noisy", he won't wake up. Mr. Johan. Can I park here? Go ahead, handsome. You can use my mirror. I have a bigger one. Assalamualaikum. - Wa'alaikumsalam warahmatullahi wabaraktuh. - How are you? We rarely meet even though we are neighbors. Right. I've been busy. You're like a man in love. Take care of what you have. Don't make it complicated. - I'm leaving now. - Okay. - Assalamualaikum. - Wa'alaikumsalam warahmatullahi wabaraktuh. You still remember where the gate is, don't you? Hopefully. Hey. Where is Razak? In Babah's room. Oh. Why is he with Babah? Because I want to be with you. Razak. Wake Abi up before you go to school. Is he here? He is in the room. He said he missed you. Hooray! I want to play with him later. Okay. - Ma'am. The car is waiting for Razak. - Tell them to wait. Abi! Wake up! My champ! I missed you. Why are you rarely home? Yeah. I had a job out of town so I couldn't come home. But now I'm not busy anymore. So I can play with you. Let's play later! Okay. What do you want to play? I have PlayStation now. See? Babah. I will bring Reza's breakfast to our room. Okay. My champ has to go to school first, though. I don't mean to be rude. - We'll play later. - You promise we'll battle later, right? Maybe he still feels uncomfortable with me. Bye. Go now. - Good luck! - Okay. Where are you going? Actually I wanted to talk to you last night. But we fell asleep. I'm going to start working today. Work? Why? Well... I feel like I have to. You have to? Is it because you think I can no longer provide for this family? Am I that worthless? Don't misinterpret it. I'm not judging you. Truthfully, after knowing that you aren't working I decided to start working. And you couldn't be reached either. It's like you vanished. You're the one who couldn't be reached! You never picked up when I called. You can say whatever you want, but the truth is different. Where do you work? At Ferry's office. I didn't expect you could do this to me. What? I honestly don't understand what you mean. By working at your family's online gambling business, you are admitting that I can't provide for this family. Did you never think about that? Sorry. Yes, I didn't think about that. Because I always respect other people's good intentions. If we're being honest, it's true that we're not that well-off. Not poor, though. Okay. So now you're insulting me? I'm tired of talking to you. You keep misinterpreting my words. I have no intention to insult you. Okay. I know your family is rich. But that doesn't mean they have the right to dictate my wife to humiliate me! This! This is what I hate the most about you. Whenever we're talking about something, you always go off-topic. You aren't focused nor communicative. And in the end you always blame my family. I'll never let anyone insult my family, especially Babah. Because I know for sure they aren't bad people. The bottom line is I will never let you work! Whatever you earn from that job, you earn it from gambling. And that's illegal. I don't want my son to live off illegal money. Do you understand? I didn't expect you to be that narrow-minded. Do you think that all this time you're feeding me and Razak from legal money? Do you think the income you earned from creating gossips and slanders is legal? You always think you're right in things that you don't even know. And all you do is get angry every single time. When the truth is you're actually angry at yourself. If all you can do is get angry and foster hatred, what's the point of being religious? I will use my prerogative as a husband to forbid you from working. Period. I'm still going to work. This? Are you proud of these illegal stuff? This too? You gave Razak illegal stuff! You have no shame! Forget all of our memories. They no longer hold a meaning! Nothing! Nothing at all! Hey! Don't be vicious towards my daughter! Don't interfere! She disrespects her husband. She doesn't respect you because you're vicious! You guys always drive me into a corner. Always underestimate me. - Go inside the room! - I'm sure you're doing this to make me leave the house. Okay. I'll leave! I'll go out of your lives since I can't stand being in this house anymore. And you. You do whatever illegal work you do. But one day, I'll come back and take Razak away from here. I don't want him to be raised by people who live off illegal income. I don't want to hear excuses. Tonight all of us will gather here. Whatever your decision is, your sisters and I won't interfere. It is fully your right. We're gathered here to tell you that we aren't the cause of all this chaos. Your siblings' kindness and help are out of good intention. But my husband is tortured by your kindness. I know this is your rented house. But I need you to leave now or Babah, Razak and I will leave instead. I will leave. The main problem is both of you not being able to appreciate differences. You and your wife are obviously different. Ethnicity. Culture. Behavior. Even your religion is different. Then how could you demand similarity? Are you expecting Angela to be like you? Or maybe like your Umi? Or the other way around? This is the wrong paradigm. Both of you should realize that you are different. Why? Because that difference will help you grow, instead of overpowering each other. You're allowed to feel imprisoned in your marriage. But don't forget that there should be respect in a household, not only love. Because the foundation of love and marriage is a total opposite. Love has a simple point of view, meanwhile marriage complicated. It's full of order. That's why sincerity is needed from both of you to admit that the foundation of marriage is not only love, but also the main value which is respect. You're a leader. Abi! Hey! Razak! My champ. I miss you. Abi, why did you not come home yesterday? You promised to play games with me. But my game console is broken. Umi said the cable was burnt so it's broken now. Hello? Someone is asking to meet you. His name is Mr. Reza. Just tell him I'm out of town on a business trip. - Thank you. - Yes, Ma'am. Razak. You have a new PlayStation already? Did Akong buy it for you? No, it's Abi who bought it for me. Abi? When did you meet him? He came to school. "Do I have to choose a different path to reach the same place?" Babah. Babah. Where are you going? This is your home. No, it is not. This is our home. Move! Move! Walk! I don't want to! - I don't want to! - Move now! - I don't want to! - Walk! - Are you married? - Shut up. Walk! I don't want to! Hey. Don't tell your sister, alright? I'll be fine. Yes, Andrea? Angela, where are you? What happened? Vincent is arrested. Please don't let Babah know. Turn off the TV if possible. Today Corruption Eradication Commission arrested a suspect in bribery of government officials case. Allegedly the suspect with initial VI has been doing so for the past few years. Is it true that you're involved in money embezzlement of 7 trillion? - Please answer. - Who else is involved? Vincent. Please give an answer. I... lost... my three sons. They're not lost, Babah. They only left.
