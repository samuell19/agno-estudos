The Emperor arrived with imperial relief As this has been an imperial hunt You had a lot of surprises in store for us... capped by a super finale You have a great talent for the chase It mustn't go to waste Your efforts deserve a reward Do you wish to become my Master of hounds? Or would you like an embassy? In London, for instance, as your wife would wish? I feel privileged to be so honored I wish to serve Your Imperial Majesty... as Master of Hounds I refuse to stay here It's some kind of plot Why couldn't my husband simply say... he would prefer to be ambassador in London? Does the Emperor think... you cannot be both ambassador and master? But you can! You can be one and the other You will never leave, Madam Since you hunt, your presence here... will be expected by hunting parties And by the Emperor Heinberg, it is your turn to choose Would you rather have the woods in which we hunted... or be made a director... in my coal mines? I believe you also know about mining? I do, but I'd rather have the woodland Not the mines? No more than you wished to become an ambassador Choice, Your Highness, is a great privilege The woodland's yours But take good care of it... and guard its secrets "I am part of the part that once used to be, "A part of the darkness from which light arose‚Äù The bison's head for His Majesty! I can explain things to the Emperor I'm sure I can persuade him I shall have to dismiss my adjutant No doesn't know I'm here either No one does I don't understand That's hard to believe Your Majesty displayed such acumen today... in granting people's hidden wishes... that I am sure you can see to it... that this little episode also has a happy ending If events are allowed to take their couree... you will never leave this place Well? You wanted me to alter my decision? Yes. You thought I'd give way to a woman? Yes. Yes. At last I've got what I wanted. What did you promise me? What price your word? Got anything in writing, Your Highness? You're destroying woodland! Starving trees of water! Frightening the game away! I'll buy it back You'll a man of my word It would cost you too much You're in financial trouble. New palaces are expensive Name your price! Your mines are not doing well One day they'll cave in and you'll be ruined You seem to be an expert on coal No worse than on timber Whoever went into cal here acquired... a von to his name in ten years I mean to that too... and gaze out from my own palace windows at yours How much, Herr "von" I don't want anything My father and grandfather served you as wuntsman I do not intend to- at any price One question Who did better out of that imperial hunt? Listen to me, Highness Did I, by ceasing to be your huntsman... ...or you, by becoming the Emperor's? Are you any closer... to your dream of becoming regent of Silesia? I, Highness, have what I wanted THE MAGNATE Gentlemen! I have received sad news Our employer... owner of all the mines Prince von Teuss... is on his deathbed. Why is it so quiet? Why is it so quiet? When a soldier lies dying there should be noise! The Emperor's adjutant is dying The sirens should be sounding! Why?... No! Leave that! What's going on? Run for it! Sirens? Sirens? Yes, sirens Does that mean I've died? What did that alarm mean? Are you afraid to tell us... there's no work for us? Don't threaten us. A lad's been killed. Say something. They mean business I'm the one who switched on the sirens The Prince is dying There can't be. Quiet! There can't be Quiet! Hans, tell me... that it's not my fault, that it's not my doing I beg you! Say it's not me Her Highness would like to know... if her husband is any better I can't speak for my Polish colleague... but I am certain all will be well I share that view. The crisis is over Sirens... Sirens... I know... It was Nelke One should think twice before sounding them Maybe my sons will hear? Hear the sirens! Can your crystal ball tell your Director Zbierski I wonder what will come of this Look! Bolko! Conrad! Here's Bolko Last month's business... and a draft of the French contract You work so hard for me, von Teuss I'll raise your salary and make you... director-general of all my mines It will crown the history of our families I'm afraid I must refuse Family duties are calling me... and the go back to the 12th century That's a long time I find it hard to know what to make of you Prince. I can't return the compliment I've always know what to make of you...Count A telegram, Count. Urgent What are you gawking at? What's this? I haven't seen him for ten years He disowned me for becoming a Catholic He played God with our lives For five days I was kept locked up in a room Outside - an uprising, machine guns firing My mother out of her wits, and me incarcerated To this day I still can't get out of that room We shall see Welcome. Prince Hello. Our younger sister If you should see Mother... Silly of me - I forgot Can he also have come to make his peace? Franzel has changed You think so? Hens still lay eggs Would you believe it! The world wasn't fated to end with my death I see, Yurek, that you too... have come to attend my funeral Please forgive me my faux pas I have no intention of dying Not yet at any rate That's not all As I lay there in my bed... dying my little death... it occurred to me that I ought... to have another child At my age that could be an achievement "I will hold out for twenty more years on the virility front" Who said that? You don't know, you Prussian numskulls! If the press gets hold of your joko... Heinberg and Krupp will die laughing You've a subject... for a new farce, Zbierski That's right. A farce. I think you gentlemen wish to be left alone Is it you who are going to give him this child? Sit down Conrad! You no longer count Your conversion has made you a Pole... and that weakens the family I am Franz Friedrich XVIII Old Heinberg bought himself his title... and is laughing at us because he knows we're not a danger So you believe the family is all-important? Absolutely It's like a nation. While it acts together... it is strong. It grows effetes if it yields... to individualist urges As you do, Father! I daresay. Now and then You want proof? You marriage to Marisca You chose a woman reeking of scandal And Conrad's parties? Nude chorus boys cavorting on the lawn... Or Bolko's notorious plunges at all of Europe's gaming tables? It's my free will Free will belongs to mythology In real lift what counts is strength of will You're citing Nietzsche -Am I? I didn't know -Look it up! Are you talking about family or fortune? Property and family Only I can put both back on their feet Properly managed, our property... ...could make us one of Europe's foremost families But we already are As far as debts go, no question Maybe you'd like to try? I would, but I'd have to be given power of attorney How broad? Very broad In that case I'll be begging for my bread It's for the good of the family and so yours too And yours He's forgiven him his orgies! - For your good too - Mine? You'll get your power af attorney Such youthful enthusiasm does the heart good But consider one thing I gave Heinberg a forest what he got was a coal field Instead of regent... - I became... - Master? A cuckold! You were so wrong... believing that absurd pack of lies Then why does the Emperor make so much of you? All those courtesies, pretty speeches? that clutching of little hands? Because he's able to see these things differently Not the way you do, you Prussian numskulls Because you were his lover I was not Yes you ware- after the hunt Know why he treats me differently from you? Not because I'm a woman... but because I tell him the truth... instead of just agreeing like you sycophants You can't see beneath the surface of things That's why you were denied a diplomatic career... not because I was the Emperor's mistress -So you ware! -l wasn't -You just said so! -No I said something else - I heard you say it!1 - Because you wanted to! You admitted it! 1 did not - You were! - No! You were! Yes! I was! If it helps you justify our failures... I was the Emperor's mistress Noooo! Is Franzel my son? At last you're not certain of something When the war is over... 1 will find myself a new wife A bad woman. with the touch of evil But I will know that... and be in command Come on! Where's the fire? At this hour I go to bed provided it's a good town with a good hotel Where are we going? One of ours, at a standstill We'll move on There's no work for you! "Piast", also ours Working every other day It was meant to be working The men reported for work They're being turned away There's no market for our coal There's a slump Look at that, dammit! How I love good old Silesia! All of this is yours Plus the mines "Barbara" "new Hope", "Princeling" and "Szadok" A cementworks in Ligota Briquette factories, brickyads and breweries in Tychy Very impressive Itis and it isn't We'll now pay a call at the office So they don't want to buy our coal? I see you've locket up the siren To prevent careless use Who has the keys? Leave us gentlemen Two days ago! A week ago! Two weeks ago! A month ago! Get rid of this fountain! This isn't a palm court Look. It's been following us since we left Gangsters, no doubt. From Chicago Planning to hijack us to Singapore. Fantastic! Step on it! They don't have wings What is it? Nothing, nothing... Have they gone? Oh no! Someone's telling me to make up my mind Trying to force me to join them - But who? - Who? Who? Now I need you two more than enver - Bolko! - Leave it. Get in Thanks, but screw all this Get in! I don't want to know. I'm leaving This isn't my thing I'm not cut out for it. What's the matter? Can't a man walk in front of a car? Apparently not What scared you so? I'll represent the family above ground -Not coming? -It's unnatural And cheap propaganda anyway Your first descent? All the best... to you and your families... from my family Cheers, foreman - Cheers, foreman...? - Grela Cheers!!! Which level are you Foreman Grela Output ‚Äî 30 tones It's a low drift We have to work on all fours Why are you so small? He hasn't grown Get your mother to feel you better You'll get machinery when sales recover, Grela The market's tight now... Cheers! You've laid off 400 miners Merry Christmas! Get the herrings? I had no alternative, Grela They're all Poles Not now, Grela Come and see me and we'll talk it over I shan't be visiting Your Highness It's you who've come to see us Thank you kindly! Cheers! What on earth? What did you say? - Is this a breakdown or.. - Or what? You're learning fast Got any matches? You have a candle? As an offering to Saint Barbara A candle? So light it If there's gas here we'll be blown sky high Assuming it's coincidence This is the kind of place that if there's gas here... if there's gas here you'd better start praying You'll be ging to feel faint, to throw up... Stop it! It's all thanks to your gracions gestures! His Lordship dispensing champagneto the miners! It's part of the job I should have stayed home Then I would have had to suspect you as well Of what? You mean to say you don't suspect anybody? Nobody Think, Conrad Think! What are you doing? We're in luck. It stopped at a gallery Mind the step Give me your hand...Come on I wouldn't count the steps We're fixing it Please keep calm You're in no danger. We're fixing it There's no need to panic We're fixing it Please keep calm We're perfectly calm Forgive me, Prince. Forgive me, Count Those responsible will be punished. It was sabotage I see Director Zbierski ‚Äî you're fired You're awfully suspicious. Franzel People should be open and sincere Not in business matters I have to know who's stabbing me in the back That's why I can't leave? Exactly why You've dropped your last bundle at Monte Carlo I believe you have an appointment in Warsaw? Keep me out of this He's afraid of us, Conrad. Afraid! I wish I'd studied you more closely as a boy You could have, being the oldest That's the pity of it But why can't I leave? I'll explain. Our family... is facing a great, historical task I have to be certain that it won't be impeded... by you, Conrad or Marisca Otherwise the whole thing is pointless I came to say goodnight to Conrad and Franzel I've already said it to you Very well. I'll stay here as long as you wish Let's see you lead the family to greatness I like it in Poland But I'm not sure if your stand to win by this May 1? I can't be sure... but if what I think is correct... I ought to be in Germany as soon as possible It is of course secret business? It concerns out family, father The point is that Heinberg... might well resort to skullduggery I've known that Well... good luck But if I were you I'd remember... ......that one of the sources of our greatness... was a casual attitude to what politicians call... making history A rising? Yes, a rising! Arising ! My congratulations on a well executed assault In Polish? I provide for every contingency Please resume hostilities Might you Piast ancestors not be telling you... to adept Polish citizenship when the time is right? Draw up the naturalization papers As you wish, Highness What are you doing, Conrad? Your Protestant God is looking for you everywhere You don't understand a thing It's only now that I can leave I'm free at last Stop! Unpack the boys' things You think I'd lot you take them with you? You don't have the right to dictate to me There's a rising I do have the right I'm in my backyard Unpack the boy's things... What's that? Are you a Catholic , my son? Yes, father Do you have any idea at all what that means? IT means that I feel Polish You can feel Dutch for all I care - So it's all right? - Not quite There is no more important decision in life... than choice of faith You have taken it without confiding in the family It was a personal decision It cannot be a personal decision Religion is a family affair It's a question of rules which you have to obey... because they are what what bind us and protect us Bring Count Conrad his trunk He is leaving with his mother - Bolko! - Mama! Mother's left you a letter "My dear Hans... You once said you wanted an evil woman to succeed me I believe I've found the very person Her name is Baroness Marisca della Botega and she is related to us through the Anhalten I met her a year ago in Cap d'Antibes Von Sutzpold, her husband, committed suicide... from, by all accounts jealousy Since then she has been travelling "I very much recommend, her Daisy" Remember, Highness Take no nonsense from them It's they who need you not vice versa He owns a beautiful slice of Silesia Very good coal The Prince's position is known to you? Of course But we don't know what he expects from us I must show you something I'm sure you'll understand me I'm glad you came. Not a moment too soon It was high time But now you must be patient. This may take time That is why I have come to you, Count I trust you completely I know You did the right thing but... who told you I had anything to do with them? I guessed You're no goof A brick was thrown into your car... and later you got stuck in a mine cage? It's incredible What barbarians! The Poles, as usual, made a hash of everything? You're alive that's the main thing Whenever you came near I had a feeling... you knew everything about me When I realized I'd marry you I had to, didn't I? You always want to know everything I not only want to, I do Don't think you can compare with your father You don't stand a chance I'm trying to tell you not to get your hopes up If I care to I'll use your legs as billiard cues If Icare to! If I ever catch you eavesdropping again! Damn! The key's gone It must have been Franzel He' been abroad since Cristmas! But he gave me these funny looks He looks at everyone like that Look at me! I'm all poppyseed Look! I'm all poppyseed I'm all poppyseed I'm all poppyseed All poppyseed You shouldn't have come here - I'm all poppyseed - You shouldn't have come! Go on! Go on! You shouldn't have! Why not? Our claims to you are about equal We met you at the same time, didn't we, Bolko? Come on now, come here That's my boy! Well? Nothing Don't laugh - I love you - Shut up! Is Jolanta my daughter? - How can you - I most certainly can! And the one you're now carrying will be my grandchild, right? Look! Come here, shy! What you were to report to Franzel you'll tell the press You will, you will! There's going to be... scandal among the nobility!! I wonder how Franzel will react... to this example of... how did he put it? yielding to individualist urges? Things aren't so simple with us, are they, Bolko? I'm pleased you've joined us, Highness Look at those lads! There's your money Live money. Dr Goebbels will thank you in person He'll be pleased to hear you accepted our invitation The peasants of Lippe... are directly descended from the Cherusci... the German tribe that crushed the Romans in the Teutoborg Forest These journalists are a rabble of Jews and Masons Is that any way to write of an illustrious old family? I understand the Fuehrer was outraged Tonight, at the palace Dr Goebbels believes... it would be ill-advised... to hold your meeting here He'll see you at Schloss Vinebeck He's outraged by the press attack on your family Attack? What do you mean? "Scandal at Von Teuss Seat" "Footman's Revelations" "Prince Finds Youngest Son in Bed with Stepmother" Anything else? Youngest son! Son! Another scandal! Prince catches youngest son! Catches son! Catches son! I have talked to Hitler He is shocked... ...by such vilification of an illustrious family How could it come to that, he asked Is there no one capable of taking charge? Yes, I replied, there is such a man He is Franzel von Teuss Hitler has not yet retired Life twists... but also sets straight Let's drink to that - Bolko! I can't! - Dance! - can't! - Dance! All these strangers I don't know anyone And you won't... We won't be coming back Why didn't we get married abroad? Why not? Let's ask our pet artist Why didn't we have a quiet wedding abroad? Because Franzel suffers from a dangerous disease It's called normality A normal wedding had to take place here He couldn't bear the idea of something as abnormal... as a union between stepson and stepmother... becoming splashed all over the newspapers That's why he agreed to a wedding... which is the most normal and hallowed of customs Beautifully put! Do you think Franzel has gone mad? I don't know but here's hoping You've given... You've given me three splendid sons Very splendid... Och, Daisy, Daisy,,,, Laugh, and the world laughs with you Weep, and you weep alone Is that an English proverb! No, my dear How I wish it were! was a toddler and was hungry... I lay in my cot and went like this... When I became a soldier I carried myself so... And when I'm a decrepit old prince... I'll take to my bed and be ignored by one and all I'll just lie there begging: water, water, water... I feel like really making you suffer One day you will yourself claim what's coming to you That's a possibility that I've also allowed for Let me go! I wish to see the Prince His Highness is indisposed. He is seeing no one He is not at home only to the wedding guests... who, sadly, also include my son But I am not here to attend the reception Feeling better? It was so strange What a beautiful tree I'll see we're buried here Be good to me From the first moment... that I set eyes on you... I laid a course for you And got there! Heinberg! Is he here too? I'm so glad you could come Count Franz Friedrich Hochberg von Teuss! I fancy we know each other inside out Me brother, Count Conrad I believe you've become a Catholic? He's the Ruberg agent May God bless you I wanted to tell you that if what I'm thinking... You won't! You're not going across to greet them! So many people have stayed away from our wedding... that something is due to those who have come My sister-in-law I understand the son and the father too You'd have done better... to as Yurek to organize this party He'd have provided you with even odder guests I see He's not eating Amazing single-mindedness! Will he refuse a pineapple as well? The pineapples took off... but there's a storm... and the plane had to return to Warsaw A storm? Quick! Wheel me over to the window! Director Zbierski would you come over here? Yes. Recognize him? Heinberg? What's he doing here? That's one thing I didn't foresee You have the floor - At last! - Why the dramatics? Please proceed I haven't come here to complain Oh? Just to look at me? Nor do any of my three Polish colleagues... whom Prince Franzel has dismissed wish to complain Certainly not. Why demean one self? Therel!... I wonder if they've prepared everything? Your Highness! my reason for coming here is to warn you To communicate our misgivings We have worked for you for so many rears We know and respect you and your family So it pains me to have to warn you that things... are in a bad way Very bad! Continue, continue Very bad! You have no funds in Poland or elsewhere You have tax arrears running into millions But what's dos Prince Franzel do? Gets involved in some kind of hanky-panky abroad! Mysteriously withdraws what's left... of his working capital! There' nothing in the bank the money's evaporated! Director Zbierski... I no longer deal with such matters You're in danger of going... into receivership Receivership? What's that mean? The Polish government appointing trustees to administer the property For how long? Until you have paid off what you owe in taxes Now old are you? Sixty-eight I am seventy How many more years do I have? Five? Six? So I'll still be protected by the Geneva convention or I can appeal... to the Hague Tribunal You could change everything with one stroke of the pen The question is, do I want to? Would it also surprise you... that your funds are financing Hitler? Lies, lies! Is Heinberg's presence here also a lie? Close all the doors! The wedding was to be held outdoors Let no one inside! Look the doors! Let no one in! We'll settle up now Your allowance will be remitted by Conrad... to Munich Aesthetically speaking, this party can't be faulted This cloudburst harmonizes rather nicely... with the way Bolko was softened up for marriage How exactly did Franzel twist his arm? By plain speaking or more subtel persuasion? Whatever you may say, however you try... to poison my mind against my family... I won't go away with you. Is that clear? Very clear. What Franzel's arguments lacked in subtlety... they no doubt made up in computablity That's business And you accept that now? I learned the hard way. It was business... that got me stuck in that cage What a ghastly place! That I once sacrificed our friendship for a doxy Now you're running out on me for money What happened? I have a search warrant In the name of the Polish Government I am attaching this plane as a pledge... for the taxes owed by Prince von Teuss Let them whistle! In Poland more steam goes into whistles than engines No wonder. Polish miners laid off, Zbierski fired Father did business differently Differently? Which is why we now owe nine million in taxes I know. For you, Count Listen you shit, don't send me money to an account... on which I can1t draw! Not now, Bolko, not now Stopping my allowance? - I'm not stopping anything - Good... By the way... Marisca's a super wife. Are you pleased? Did you send Bolko his allowance? Of course Using the Ruberg account? That's right And giving the number? In a Polish bank? Didn't you realize a check's being kept on our financial operations? Then go outside and see what you've done! By the door! Come to watch a strike? You get a thrill from the power generated by a crowd, do you? Even more from the sight of an owner chased by one Rear can also be exciting Fear? Yes, fear I made it... I can doit! I can doit! Conrad? I've gotten a hold over Franzel Made your day, have I? You don't say? Conrad? I don't believe it! Thank you, Casimir thank you! Conrad deflowered! How's that for news! I bet tongues are wagging in the kitchen! Go on, let's have it! The whole min's been surrounded by the police Director Zbierski has come back.... and joined the stay-down They've even seized that consignment of pineapples The plane's been grounded in Warsaw Fancy confiscating pineapples!! Maybe they need them as proof? - Go on! Proof of what? - How would I know? Yes, Your Highness? Have the pineapples arrived? Not yet. Why the delay? The weather Weather, weather How curious! You know what? I'll go to the airfield and collect them myself Of course. But... No buts! Get Joseph to bring the car round Of course. But it's years since you motored Stop philosophizing.. or you'll catch it Yes. Your Highness.. Tell me, Casimir, how is it... that you've stayed on with me so long? Isn't Poland calling you? So why? I've never plumbed the depths with Poland but with you, it's been known Plumbed the depths... Zbierski? What do you mean, who? Does it do at your age to be organizing strikes? I'm coming down! My dear friends! We are one big family As head of that family it is my duty... to look after those who are in trouble So please, speak out. Say what's on your minds We want... fair working hours We want meal breaks and a rest period... at midday We want honest rate-fixing We want a full week's work and pay The percentage of profits set aside per worker... is too low Coons beat us up. We're called "Mangy dogs"! Is that any way to treat kinfolk? You go to them. I've had enough What shall I say? That I have to think all these new things over Or perhaps I should call out the hussars? Why? They're behaving peacefully enough You should be more afraid of of directors who've never seen a coal face Who are you? Zbierski, mining engineer No such engineer is employed in His Highness's mines Did you hear what the miners said? They ware right All you have to do is install steam power... and put up wages. It's as simple as that He's right, but he doesn't know... that Your Highness has no money What? I own all this and I have no money? It's a ticklish subject to discuss... but vases full of flowers don't mean Of course... Go and see them I don't want them there when I leave Yes. You're are a very shrewd fellow We'll install your steam engines But I expect you want a job, which I don't have Is the pressure here always like this? What? I don't knonw... What does it mean? That there's seepage The ground's subsiding... If I were Your Highness I'd leave this place Look at the blotter Well I'll be damned! Mister Zbierski You think I have to credit your crystal-gazing? You'd have to be mightier than God Himself... and you certainly don't like Him Good day! Give me your hand! I name you crystalgazer... Director Zbierski What are you doing here, my good fairy? Lost your reason? Adventures at his age! - I did warn you - Piss on warnings! I want to know the facts. Director Zbierski ex-Director The assets securing the government's claims... in respect of taxes have been... disappearing from a Polish bank... and surfacing in Munich credited to Ruberg They then used to replenish Hitler's funds You have it in for Franzel for dismissing you Old men outlive their usefulness They should withddraw gracefully Like you? Yes. You should follow my example Well, Your Highness, it's the receiver for you And that won't be the half of it Not the half of it! Give me a cigar Go on! "I, Franz Friedrich XVII, acting on behalf of... my father, Polish citizen of German nationality... hereby lodge a complaint to the League of Nations against the Government of Poland..." You read it. You wrote it "...of Poland which is seeking by unlawful means... to Polonize the preorty of Prince von Teuss.. in order to recover taxes wrongly assessed... for the years 1925-29. This discriminatory action which is a reprisal... for employing Germans in managerial posts... must be discontinued... and incitement of workers to action contrary to the law forbidden. On behalf of my father I demand... discontinuance of all distraints... placed on the property of the Prince... compensation for losses... and an end to government interference... in personnel policy... as well as declaration of the Government... to be in violation of Articles 67,68,75 of the Convention" Why should I sign this? If and when I withdraw your powers of attorney... then I'll start signing How long will I go on signing on your behalf? I never ask you questions But if it proves to be true that one mark of mine... has paved Hitler's way to power... you will stop signing So much as a single mark! I look forward to seeing Granddaddy Daddy! Daddy-Grnddaddy He won't let you in Then I'll sneak in Will we land in Germany... or Poland? Germany. Then Casimir will drive us into Poland - It's very near - There'll be no car He won't even see you I can tell him what I have on Franzel... in writing Pleased?. I feel as if were carrying a bag of diamonds You are pleased Franzel made me look silly, arranging our marriage It's me he wanted to humiliate Did you ever notice the way he used to look at me? How? He'd have liked to be in your shoes... but lacked the nerve Makes no difference Prince Bolko von Teuss? Please with us. No fuss, Countess. It's vulgar Step back. Nooooo I'm loaded! I won it at roulette At roulette! No! The Gestapo... arrested him... as soon as we got off the plane He knew everything about Franzel Everything! What's the use of hiding? I can see you anyway She's right Franzel and Heinberg formed a company Account number: 00033 The only other people with access to it... were two senior NSDAP officials Is that Polish deputation still waiting? Halt! So we meet again... Mister Grela The Grela you once met... was my father "1, Hans Heinrich XV Hochberg von Teuss... hereby consent... to, assignment of all my property. The mental illness which has affected... my son Franz Friedrich... incapacitates him for managing my affairs. all power of attorney is therefore transferred... to my son Conrad... who will act as my proxy... on the control board". Signed: Hans Heinrich XV, Prince of Pszczyna That still leaves the sacked directors... and Polish miners, and the pit floodings But, gentlemen, you have a board of trustees! Discuss that with them and with Count Conrad You heard? The Prince has agreed! I only asked you... to prevent my brother from going to Poland And how did you expect us to stop him? By turning him back at the frontier We did so But why has he also been put in prison? Reichsminister Goebels would reply... that in this case... there is more at stake than your family interests What will you do with him? I understand he has run up large debts in Munich That will have to be investigated I can settle all his bills You can't do anything, Prince Are you aware... that your father has withdrawn... all your powers on the grounds... that you are of unsound mind? You're lying! Am I also to conclude that you're deranged? The Reich Government... for your petition to the International Tribunal All that's left to you is to remain in Germany... and await better days When they come as they soon will... von Teuss will return to his palace Like a young god! Can I see my brother? It all went wrong You were to be sent back to Munich I wanted you to... It all went wrong You were to be sent back to Munich I wanted you to understand everything It all went wrong Whatever I've done has been for the family For us, you understand? For the family! They want to destroy us, to strip us of everything Tell Father that they have a precise plan They intend to take everything Cur mines, our woodland, our breweries, our palaces I know. It's Heiberg's doing Tell Father that I'm the only one who can save everything Only me. Got that? Only me! Don't look at me like that I've done you no harm. It was them Them! Will you tell him? I won't tell him anything. I'm here for good They keep me doped I'm given injections to make me beter, they say I had an abscess. They say they're treating me What are they doing to you?
