Or am I gonna bring you a whole lotta trouble? - Okay. Whiskey and a wash rag. - I'm Charles Humberstone, mayor and owner of New Angeles. New Angeles is a smoke-free, drug-free, alcohol-free, underwater agricultural community located 400 miles off the coast of Phoenix looking for hard workers. We require a four year commitment working and living onsite in our beautiful underwater city. So if you're interested in the career of a lifetime, phone the number at the bottom of your screen. And I thank you very much. - That'll take the sting away. - I'm looking for a girl. Have you seen her? - You think if something like this came in here, I'd still be using meat like that? Why would a lady like this come down here to the surface anyway? Maybe end up sweating 10 hours a day in some robot factory. Or maybe end up a stripper or a hooker. - So you haven't seen her? - No. Is she the real thing? - Did that look like a droid passing as a human to you? - Hell, I can't tell the difference anymore. Hey, that's old. You wanna play for it? [watch chiming] Hey. I'll keep my out for you. [exciting music] [ship beeping] [exciting music] - [Hawks] Are you sure they're here? - Data transmissions from Alpha Bank report they sold four pleasure droids to the Jupiter colony three weeks ago. Transfers off the colony is illegal. They must still be here. - Yeah, but where? - [Caller] I do not know. I am not programmed for android search capabilities. My knowledge of pleasure droids is as follows: PDs are androids designed to appear as various female humans. - I know all that. - They are programmed to initiate and enjoy sexual congress with any human sensory distance and will attach themselves to you. So be careful. - Right. [sexy music] [women moaning] Bingo. Ladies, can I please have your attention? - I'll do anything you desire. My name is Mariah and I'm designed to please you. - Oh, wait a minute. Wait, down, down. I get sexual pleasures by having women follow me single file down the hallway. - Let me see to your pleasure. - By all means, single file. Down the hallway. I'll be rich. [intriguing music] [whistles] - Hi, I'm taking these droids in for repairs. I got the work order right here. Somewhere. Oh, here it is. They'll have to be reprogrammed. There's something wrong with their oral functions. They bite. All right ladies, single file. Come on. - Ooh, hello. Ah. [droid smooches] [exciting music] - Ladies, you stay right here. [exciting music] This is Universal Condor. Am I clear for takeoff? - [Man] Condor, this is Tower. We can find no flight path for you. [exciting music] Universal Condor, you are not clear for takeoff. - Ground control? Ground control? I am losing you. - [Man] Universal Condor, this is Stratus Guard. Return to base immediately. - This is Universal Condor. What can I do for you boys? - Return to base immediately. - No can do. - Prepare your ship for boarding. - I don't think so. Look. I never sample the merchandise, okay? Just give me some room so I can do my job. Now. [exciting music] - [Man] Don't let him get away. - Copy, Blue Leader. [exciting music] - Ha! Ha ha. [shouts] [exciting music] Earth, here I come. Look, I told you, I never sample the merchandise, okay? - Just let me do my job, okay? - What a way to make a living. [intriguing music] - Fire. Come on. [groaning] [watch ticking] No. [screams] [panting] [phone trilling] [answering machine beeps] - [Burt] Mr. Ford, this is Burt Weatherbeam. Remember the trouble you had with us last month? Well, we'd be interested in forgetting all about it if you would do me the pleasure of reporting to the Bennet Corporation tomorrow morning and see Mr. Reginald. He's a friend of mine and he has an assignment for you and I strongly urge that you do not overlook our suggestion. Thank you. [answering machine beeps] [thunder rumbling] [intriguing music] - [Man] State your name and business. - Jack Ford. I've got an appointment with Mr. Reginald. - [Man] Please place palm on scanner. [scanner beeps] Thank you. Have a nice day and mind the doors. - You sent for me? - Yes. - Well? Do I pass inspection? - You'll do. - I got a message. Something about a job. - Yes. Four pleasure droids were stolen last night from the Mining Colony on Jupiter. It's believed that they were brought here to Phoenix where they'll be sold on the black market. - And you want me to hunt them down? - You know the surface world. Places where they could be hidden. I'm told it's your element. - It's where the real people live. - The Minute Corporation is prepared to pay you 10,000 credits each for their safe return. - 10,000? - Yes. - A pleasure droid's worth a million dollars retail. Each. I'd be better off stealing them myself and selling them to a third party. - Except that droids are illegal. If you're caught with one in your possession, you could end up in prison. - You gotta catch me first. - All right, we're prepared to pay 100,000 each, no more. For their safe recovery. - Cash only. No credits. If it isn't green, doesn't have a picture of a president on it, I don't want it. - I'm not sure we can assemble that much actual cash. - Try. - You'll be accompanied by a technician. - I work better on a long leash. - Mr. Ford, those pleasure droids are very valuable to me. If they're damaged, they're just scrap iron. Can you shut down a droid without leaving any marks? I thought not. Mr. Ford. Beth Ann Wright. - Sir, you can't possible expect me to team up with this man. He smells of bot oil. And sweat. - I work for a living, sweetheart. What do you do? - I am a respectable college educated member of society. - You ever been down on the surface? - Not exactly. But I've seen it on National Geographic. - She wouldn't last 10 seconds out there. - You have your assignment. Here are photographs of the four pleasure droids. - Sir, I really must insist. - Come on. [lighter clicking] - Would you wait up? Hey. [intriguing music] [Beth coughing] God, what's that smell? - Pollution. Our air isn't filtered down here. - That's interesting. Is that a real time piece? - That's right. I can wind it and everything. - You know, you really oughta do something about your manners. - I'm saving up for charm school. Look, this could be dangerous. Why don't you go back upstairs and have a hot toddy or something? - Look, you don't have to like me, Jack Ford. But you need me. I can shut down a droid. - So can I, permanently. - I'm cyber trained in judo and karate. I've got over a hundred hours on the simulators. - Well, that's great. If we run into any simulated killers you can take over. - Oh, and what's in the bag? More weapons? - You don't wanna know. - Yes I do. [head squishing] - Satisfied? - Yeah, fine. - [Jack] Let's go talk to these guys. - [Beth] Oh, and what will they know? - Four beautiful women in this neighborhood? They might have noticed. How you doing, guys? - Doing okay, I guess. - I'm Jack, that's Beth. - Oh. Real good to meet you. We were just about to have some dinner. You want some? - Yeah, it smells good. - [Man] It is. - You can tuck into some of that, I bet. - Jack. - You better accept some, you're gonna insult the man. We'd be glad to join you. - All good. It'll be ready in a couple minutes. - We're looking for some women. Good looking, not mutants. - There ain't nothing but mutants now. You know, you know, when I was a kid, just fresh outta high school, I went out to Los Angeles and lots of pretty women, hundreds. [laughing] I had me some good times. [laughing] And then I came back here and uh, I went to Arizona state. And then when that big 8.7 hit you just get knocked all of them, all of California and other states into the ocean. All we got left now is mutants. But a couple pretty good ones though. - Yeah? Where would that be? - Well, the nuns they got over there at the soup kitchen. They pretty fine looking. And they're friendly, know what I mean? - Nuns? - Yeah, they're pretty hot looking. There's a couple of habits I'd like to get under. [laughing] What? Stop that. He don't mean no harm, Miss. Charter, keep your hands off of her. - We'd better move on. We'll take a rain check on the meal, thanks. - I can still use a little donation for the grub. - Oh, sure. - Oh, thank you. Give Charter one, too. Listen, y'all come back tomorrow night. Charter caught a rat the size of a dog. It's good. You know, when you cook it right. - I'm gonna collect the bounty on this. Maybe ask a few questions. You coming? Go on. Go on. [sexy music] I'm here to see Chew. There's a bounty on this head and I'm here to collect it. Chew'Bah. - Jack. As you can see, I'm quite busy at the moment. - No rest for the wicked, huh? - I'm always trying to get ahead. - Well then this is your lucky day. I believe our deal was 20 grand, dead or alive. - 20 was our deal, wasn't it? Get this man 20,000. How much for the girl? - What do you think she's worth? - I might be willing to spend... 10,000. - 10 grand, huh? No. She's not for sale. Right now. Speaking of women, you haven't heard of any smugglers trying to get pleasure droids into the city, have you? - Droids are illegal. They might try to pass as humans. They might try to take over. They might prove to be smarter than we are. If I knew of any droids I'd send my men out to hunt for them. Sell their heads to the government and then I wouldn't have to pay $20,000 to a bounty hunter. Right? - Right. Except, these droids are worth more alive than dead. They're a special model. - You hope to sell them on the black market? - No, actually, I'm working for the owner. He gets lonely without them. - Well, if I hear of anything I'll call you. - Thanks. - And if you change your mind about the girl... - I might. [sexy music] - Sell me? Sell me? What do you think I am? A trinket or something? - Look. - I am not merchandise. - Up there in wealthy world you might be a queen but down here on the street, if you don't have manual labor to sell or stolen goods to sell, all you've got left to sell is your body and you're worth 10,000 bucks. - And what are you worth? - Maybe 5,000 on a good day. I've got too many bullet holes. And sometimes all your worth can be reduced to a watch. - Whose was it? - Just a girl I knew. It's all I've got left to remind me of her. - Should I as what became of her? - No, I don't think you should. [sexy music] [sighs] - Tell our friend that Jack Ford is looking for him. - Yes, sir. - And tell him not to worry. We'll take care of the bounty hunter if necessary. Oh, um. Remind our partner that I expect my payment promptly. [sexy music] [intriguing music] - Ah, Mr. Chew'Bah. - Mr. Humberstone, I'm sorry to disturb you but we seem to have a problem. - We do? - Yes, there's a droid gunner looking for the missing merchandise. His name is Jack Ford. He's good. - When he's good, he's dead, isn't he? - As you wish, sir. - Mr. Walsh. There's a bounty hunter trying to reclaim the droids. Mr. Chew'Bah is going to take care of it. In the event that he fails... - We activate the assassin unit. - When the time comes. - Yes, sir. - Jack Ford has become a liability. We must cut our losses. Find him and kill him. Oh, and if you can recover my $20,000 at the same time, all the better. I think, I think we ought to have some flowers for Jack's funeral. See to it. Oh. Don't spend more than $10. - And what is this place? - It's a whore house. It specializes in non-mutant women. - Good place to hide pleasure droids. - Yup. The only problem is my droid scanner only works close up. So that means, here, take this. That we're gonna have to find a way to get inside. Yeah. I think this is gonna do nicely. - Wait just a minute. - No, I think this is our only chance. If I go in and nose around as a customer I'm gonna want you in there running interference for me. - No. - Look, just say you're a runaway wife looking for a job, okay? Ask if they've got any positions. Any openings. You know what I mean. Eh. Ace, huh? Take good care of that. - Hi. Where do I get a job application? - [Woman] Just a minute. [intriguing music] [scanner beeping] - I'm Hathaway. Are you seeking employment? - Yes. - Are you from up top? - Yeah, I couldn't live there anymore. I decided to try my luck around the surface. - This occupation can be very demanding. Many of the women who work here have some experience but aren't ready for the vigorous working schedule found here. - Anything's better than going back to him. - Very well. Follow me. We'll get you into uniform and I'll administer a brief pre-employment test. [scanner beeping] [woman screams] - Ah, all right. Take it easy. Take it easy. It won't happen again. [sexy music] [moaning] [sexy music] [moaning] [sexy music] [scanner beeping] Hi guys. Don't get up. Don't stop what you're doing. Just me. I'm just checking 'cause I got a defective scanner here and sometimes I gotta get up real close just to... Hold that for me, will you pal? Just bend your head a little. Yeah, okay, thanks. I'm sorry, I thought you might be an android. Like I said, I get a false reading on this thing sometimes so I just... [scanner beeping] You know something? Your husband's been looking for you. [scanner beeping] Well, I'll get out of your hair. [woman screams] [scanner beeping] - I, uh, I like your new look. - That'll be 200 bucks. - No thanks, I'm just window shopping. - Window shopping? That was the worst experience of my life. Do you know what Hathaway tried to do to me? - I thought you could take it? I thought you were a tough guy? All right, we better get you some clothes. - Mr. Chew'Bah has a message for you. - Yeah, special delivery. [laughing] [shouts] - Ha! [gunshots firing] Ha! - All right. Let's see what this jay bird's got in his pockets. - What's that? - It's a work card from New Angeles. - New Angeles? Could the droids be there? - I don't know. I thought the place had religion. Some guy from the God Squad owns it. How do you look in leather? - Chew'Bah's men failed. - The goddamn helicopter lost them. Shall we go forward? - Send him in. Assassin droid, I have a target for you. - I will destroy him. - His name is Jack Ford. This is his government photo card. Find him, terminate him. - My pleasure. - In here. [cat meows] - I think it's time we made a call. - What you got? - Hidden phone. - Let me see. - [Reginald] Good evening, Mr. Ford. - We got a situation here. - Oh, really? - [Jack] Yeah, somebody's trying to kill us. - Do you think it has anything to do with the stolen pleasure droids? - You're damn right. Two guys tried to kill us and they're from New Angeles. - That's preposterous. New Angeles would never have anything to do with pleasure droids. Charles Humberstone is an ultra conservative. He allows no gambling, no drugs, no alcohol. And above all, no prostitution in his complex. - Well, that explains the lack of tourism. - Yeah, New Angeles is involved in agribusiness. There is little chance of the droids being sent there. - You don't mind if I check it out, do you? - I don't think you should do that. Charles Humberstone is a very powerful man. - Do you want your droids back? [sighs] - All right. Put Ms. Ann Wright on. - Beth here. - My God, Beth. What have they done to you? - Nothing, sir. I'm dressed to be inconspicuous. - All right. Ms. Ann Wright, I want you to make sure that Mr. Ford doesn't make any actions that could result in litigation against the Bennet Corporation. - Yes, sir. So what do you think? - I think we head back to the waterfront, see if any smugglers have delivered droids to this Humberstone guy, come on. We'll go through there. [rock music] ♪ She was good she was good ♪ ♪ She was hot ♪ ♪ She was fine ♪ - You're back. - Another round of questions. You could win a whole new living room set. [chuckles] - What happened to your bag? - I traded it in. I got this. [chuckles] I'm looking for someone who can get me to New Angeles. - This ain't a taxi stand. - Look, cyclops. Are we gonna go through this again? You got a bar full of smugglers and all I need is someone with a mini sub who takes things to New Angeles. You understand? - They check every sub docks here. You can't even dock unless you got a delivery order. Whiskey and a wash, right? - And a fresh milk. - Buy a girl a drink? - I'm sorry, I don't date mutants. - I never said anything about a date. - Maybe you do know the answers. - I know lots of answers. What's the question? - Garson, get this lady a drink. I'm interested in New Angeles. The underwater world? How would a guy get there? - It's easy. You apply for a work permit. They're always looking for help. It's hard work down there though. Too many deadlines. No drugs. No gambling. No women. No fun at all. - [Jack] None of these guys go there? - Are you kidding? What for? All the fun's up here. - Your milk. - Is this your hooker? - She's a friend. And she's not for sale. - They're all for sale. [exciting music] - Jack! He's a droid. [gunshot pops] - Come on, honey. [exciting music] [electronic buzzing] [exciting music] [electronic buzzing] - He's completely shut down. - Yeah. [intriguing music] Thanks. - Now let's download him. Find out who sent him. - All right. Up you go. Come on big guy. I got it. Is that it? - [Beth] Yeah, plug it right there. - You're on. [droid beeping] - Must be some sort of auto wipe. Everything's breaking up. Wait, I can read three things. The nuns must be protected. - A religious droid? - Two is terminate Jack Ford. - Sorry, Charlie. - Three, the air strike is automatically activated. [helicopter approaching] - I think it's time we hit the road. [exciting music] - Hey. I got damages. [helicopter whirring] [exciting music] - Oh my God, Jack, you're bleeding. - I don't have time to bleed. - Let's get you some help. - Let's go to my place. I've got a bandaid there. [intriguing music] - New Angeles here I come. Hey. I'm trying to work here, okay? - All work and no play? - Look, would you please go back to the others? Will you? [groaning] - There's a bottle of local anesthetic on the counter. Can you hand that to me? - What, this? - It's all I got. Thank you. Help me. [groaning] All right. Hand me the pliers, will you please? - You know Jack, we could go to a hospital. - Just hand me the pliers. Ah. Whew. All right. [groaning] Okay. Ah, oh. There you go. Good as new. [intriguing music] - Cargo 719 approaching New Angeles. Do you copy? - [Man] New Angeles copies. What is your docking code, 719? - Docking code Lucas Solo 411. - [Man] That's a security code. - Yes, I know. I have direct shipment to Mr. Walsh and Mr. Humberstone. - [Man] Mr. Walsh, 719. - I have forbidden cargo. Am I clear to dock at New Angeles? - [Man] You're clear for entry, Mr. Hawks. - Clear for entry. That sounds so exciting. - I'm gonna be so happy when this is over. [ship beeping] [intriguing music] - Hawks? - Fred Hawks. And this is my cargo. - I'm Walsh. Mr. Humberstone's private security. I'll have my men take care of your cargo. Why don't you come with me? - [Humberstone] Ah, Mr. Hawks. - I hope you got my money ready. - Well, let's talk about that. I believe you were contracted to deliver four pleasure droids? Female models. - That's right. - Our shipping documents only show that you shipped three. Are they incorrect? - No, sir. I misplaced one. - Ah, misplaced. - Yes, somewhere in Phoenix. - Well, we contracted for four, not three. So I'm only prepared to pay you 24,000. - That's less than half of what we agreed on. - We agreed on four, not three. - That's only eight grand each, [chuckles] no. These things are worth millions. - You can take your payment in cash. Or in lead. Which would you like? - Okay. What if I find the fourth droid? - Well, we'll discuss that later when you get the droid in your possession. - Okay. - It's a pleasure doing business with you. Now please, go away. - Gave you a break, Hawks. - Oh yeah? Half the money, huh? - Well, he was gonna kill you. So you think about that next time you tell anybody about your cargo. Now shove off. Idiot. [watch ticking and chiming] - You miss her don't you? - Every single day of my life. [sighs] [romantic music] I'm sorry. - Don't be. - What if somebody's smuggling these droids into New Angeles to make way for organized crime? - Who could be that powerful to corrupt New Angeles? - Only one name comes to mind. - Mr. Chew'Bah wants to see ya. - Yeah, he says he forgot and wants to give you something. - Well, let's not keep the man waiting. Come on. - Welcome back, Jack. - You double crossing son of a bitch. - Well, let's not talk about my dear sainted mother. Let's talk about money. - All right. How much you getting for corrupting New Angeles? It's a good scheme. You find a place where drugs, sex, and booze are illegal and then you provide the services. - It is a delicious scheme, isn't it? Too bad it isn't mine. - Good try. The stolen droids lead right to you. - Oh, if only that were true. But my attempts to corrupt New Angeles failed. The security's too tight on smugglers and outsiders like me. - Then where are the droids? - Well, I might tell you. For a price. - [Jack] How much? - The girl. She'd be a lot of money on the black market. [gun cocks] - Are you gonna let him sell me? - Well, I'm sorry, darling. Looks like they got us over a barrel. [exciting music] [intriguing music] New deal. You give the information, I give you your life. - I was only the broker. I hired a smuggler to steal the pleasure droids from Jupiter Colony and deliver them to New Angeles. - [Jack] Okay, give me the smuggler. - Then why don't you look for him on the waterfront? You can't miss him. He's a very large man with long golden hair. - How you survived this long I'll never know. Come on, let's get out of here. [rock music] [men cheering and whistling] [rock music] ♪ Each and every ♪ ♪ Each and every human ♪ - This is a private party. - I need to talk to you. - Look man, I don't know what I was supposed to deliver to you or when you were supposed to have it but there's been some delay with my shipment. I'll get it to you tomorrow. - Four pleasure droids. Female. You delivered four of them to New Angeles. [laughing] - Chew'Bah ratted me out? So how much are those droids worth to you? - My contact offered me $100,000 each to get them back. - He only paid me eight grand each to steal them. - I'll give you 10% to help me get them back safely. - 20. - 15. - Deal. 15 grand each. Well first the bad news. I only delivered three droids to New Angeles. I lost one here in town. - And the good news? - This is how we pass the guards. You know New Angeles has a shit load of security? There's no way in and out unless you have clearance. - So how do we get clearance? - You're coming back with the missing droid. - That's a great plan but first we gotta find her. - Done. [scoffs] - Oh no you don't. - That could work. - It will work. The son of a bitch doesn't know the difference. - What son of a bitch? - Chew'Bah didn't tell you? Hell, the crime lord of New Angeles and the tight ass conservative, law and order business man who owns New Angeles, they're the same guy. [laughing] - It's preposterous. - It makes sense. Humberstone creates a world where there is no vice, that ups the value. Then he provides the vice and gets richer. - Who else has the power to corrupt New Angeles? - It's astounding. - We think we've got a way of getting in New Angeles but we're gonna need a map of the place when we're inside. - We have a corporate espionage department. They can supply you with maps of New Angeles. - Good. Coming? - Yeah, in a moment. - My God, Beth. What has he done to you? - Showed me the real world. Wanna take a peek? [scoffs] - No. - I didn't think so. [sighs] [intriguing music] - How much further? - We'll be there in a few minutes. - This better work. You got a light? - Nope, there is no smoking in my ship. [intriguing music] Cargo Vessel 719 approaching New Angeles, do you copy? - [Man] New Angeles copies. Haven't you already delivered cargo? - Shipment was incomplete. - [Man] You're gonna have to speak to Mr. Walsh about this. - Put him on. - [Walsh] Mr. Hawks, what's this about? - Get my 24,000 ready. I'm coming back with the missing droid. She's worth a couple million. And she's got the new upgraded oral program. - [Walsh] We don't need her. - You ought to see her. She's the most beautiful thing I've ever seen. - [Walsh] Okay, bring her in. Your money will be waiting. - Thanks. We're in. - You got the tracer on? - It's hidden. It's very uncomfortable. - I'm sorry about that but we need you to wear it to lead us to the droids. I better get out of sight. [ship beeping] - You're right. She is the pick of the litter. - Great, let's get my 24,000. [exciting music] - Hey you. Let me see your ID card right now. - My ID. You want my ID don't you? I got it here somewhere. Just let me look. Yeah. Well, hell. That ain't it. [exciting music] Oh yeah. You want my ID huh? Yeah. Here's my ID. I knew I had it around here somewhere. [scanner beeping] Oh, hey, how you doing? - Hey. New guy. You're out of uniform. Don't let the super see you like that. He'll dock your pay. - Yeah, that uniform thing, thanks. Thanks for reminding me. - You expect me to pay 24,000 for one droid? - Look at her, she's worth it. - I'm here to serve you, sir. How can I suit your pleasure? - Well, she is better built than the others. And, uh, softer too. You'd never guess that there's a machine underneath. - [Hawks] Sure doesn't look like it. - [Humberstone] Have you felt her? - No. I never sample the merchandise. - [Humberstone] Does she advanced programming? - Oh, yes. All her oral functions have been expanded. - Mr. Walsh will take you to the payroll office where you can pick up your money. - I'll put her with the other droids. - See to Mr. Hawks' money. She can stay here with me for the time being. I do like to sample the merchandise. Close the door. You're exquisite. - Thank you, sir. I was designed that way. - You have advanced functions? - Yes, sir. - Would you like a drink? I mix a wonderful martini. - Splendid, I'll have one. [intriguing music] - Cocktails for two. - I prefer the Spike Jones version. - Ha, you're programmed for humor. - Yes, I have all the advanced oral functions. Humor. Literature. I can speak seven different languages. - [Humberstone] Marvelous. - It must be very demanding work running an underwater agribusiness. If you'd like to talk about it I'm programmed to listen and sympathize. - You're a fascinating piece of technology. - Thank you. [intriguing music] Watch it. - What's the matter? Have you been reprogrammed? - I'm programmed to please and amuse. - Good. Then you take your gown off and lay down on that desk. Did you hear me? Do you hear me? What the? You're human. Think of the diseases. [intriguing music] [scanner beeping] - [Guard] Hold it. [exciting music] [guard shouting] [pager beeping] - What is it? - Oh, it's just my beeper. After you. - Oh shit. Couldn't you wait until after I got my 24,000? So I could at least die in peace? - Mr. Humberstone needs me. I guess that droid is a fake. What is she? Some street skank from Phoenix? - Is that what Mr. Humberstone thinks? - Well, Mr. Humberstone thinks it's a trap. But I don't think you're that smart. - I'm not. [exciting music] [gun jams] - Oh shit. - Well, I'd like to see how this ends but I gotta run. [groaning] [exciting music] - We got an intruder in the plant. Sound the alarm. [exciting music] - [Man] Intruder alert. Intruder alert. This is not a drill. Intruder alert. [exciting music] [scanner beeping] [exciting music] [intriguing music] - Psst. Ah, it's me, it's me, it's me. - Jack. - Where's Beth? - Oh, I'm sorry, Humberstone kept her. He wants to try her out. - That's not good. - Yeah. And I didn't even get my 24,000. Can you believe it? - Oh, I hate that. - Yeah. I don't think he ever intended on paying me. Sure, he takes the merchandise and stiffs me. - I tell you what we'll do. I'll go get the droids first and then we'll go back and get Beth, how's that? - Okay, let's go. - Now, now. You tell me what's going on here. [scanner beeping] - Hey, hey, I'm getting something. - Yeah? Is it my 24,000? - It's the pleasure droids, remember? You get 10%. 10. - You're right. [scanner beeping] - All right, let's get them out. There you go, sweetheart. You're free. There you go. All right, girls. Now, what we're gonna do is, we're-- Excuse me. You know what? I don't think we have time for this right now. - We have all the time in the world. - Yeah. Hawks, how do I get them off me? - Jack, that's what they do. They're like leeches. [chuckling] Hawks, do something. - Ladies, he only gets pleasure from watching. - That's right. That's right. I only get pleasure from watching, thanks. All right girls, if you really wanna make me happy all you gotta do is listen to what I say. All right? - Let me slip out of my gown and you can touch me anywhere. - Freeze. Freeze. I'm not using you, sweetheart. Here, just put that. All right, ladies, follow me. Single file. This way. [exciting music] [Jack whistles] Okay girls, okay, okay. Here we go. There you go. Right over here. Right over here. - That was easy. - Yeah, so far. Come on, let's go. Okay, girls, go on. Go right ahead there. There you go. Hey, hey, hey. - I'm programmed to excel in bondage as well as group sex. - Yeah, save it, sister. Come on, we gotta make some waves. - Not yet. Humberstone still has Beth. - There isn't enough time. - I'm going back for her. I got her into this and I'm getting her out of this. - There's about a hundred men out there waiting for us. - I'm bringing her back and you don't get paid unless I make it. So I suggest that you wait here for me. - I'm not gonna wait for you. I'm going in with you. - Okay, good. - I built New Angeles to be a perfect community. No vice, no crime, no sin, no sinners. But after awhile, productivity decreased. The workers had no work. There was nothing for them to look forward to when they came home and church attendance dropped off. You don't need confessionals when there's no sin to confess. - So you imported sin? - Yeah, and now I'm gonna cleanse you of yours. [exciting music] [screaming] [exciting music] - Hey, they're over here. [watch chiming] [groaning] - Oh, Jack. - Come on, big guy. Come on. - Just... [coughing and chuckling] Just get Beth back, okay? - I will. - And get those droids out of here. - I promise. - Just promise me one thing. - What? [coughing] - Just make sure I get my ship, okay? - You will. [groaning] [solemn music] [footsteps approaching] - You came back for me. Why? - A long time ago somebody needed me and I wasn't there. So I swore I'd never be late again. - Looks like you're right on schedule this time. [solemn music] - Come on. [solemn music] - It's all there. 300,000. [romantic music] Beth? You're not going with him? - Why not? - About my fourth pleasure droid? Do you have any idea where she is? - Out there. Somewhere. [uplifting music] - Take you to swim. Oh, maggots. God, I hate maggots. Oh, that's not good. You kidding? [chuckles] All right. Here, take my arm. Are we going to your place or mine? I got a nice alley there that looks good. Which way is it? To the right? [intriguing music] [rock music]
