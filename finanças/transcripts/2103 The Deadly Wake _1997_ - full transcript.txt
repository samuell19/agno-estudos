It was real hero weather. The Jason Acorn was in grave jeopardy, her fore bulkhead was caving. Jesus, I could have saved her still... Then the plasma drive imploded spreading fire throughout. That's when I knew we were damned. Oh, we fought that raging inferno anyway, it seemed forever, one losing battle after another. The Jason Acorn, a 93-year-old freighter broke up and sank in heavy seas today when its retrofitted plasma turbines blew spreading intense fire... They said I, was negligent, but I had told the truth, that Manxx Clifton had fraudulently documented the Acorn's seaworthiness after a second rate retrofit. I had the proof. ...and bells tolled throughout this maritime town, as it mourned the loss of 23 with the sinking of the Jason Acorn. Trial came to an abrupt end today, 6 years after the loss of the Jason Acorn, the court deemed unruly Captain McGuire mentally unfit to continue in the legal battle... In the year 2103, the Lilith, a freighter under the command of one Captain Murdoch, set both its engines at full ahead and deliberately rammed the island city of Proxate Corporation. The Lilith plowed through two support pylons, neatly taking out Proxate's corporate headquarters with much loss of executive life. This is the story of the events leading up to Murdoch's decision to ram Proxate City. And me, I was the first mate, and like Murdoch, I came to the Lilith as a matter of destiny. Hello, sailor. Fancy a bit? I'm better than jacking it in, you know. No? Okay. It's a lively gloom. Maybe we could just keep company a while. Jesus, you broke it! Hey! It's him. Care for a drink? What's this? Your kit. I'm Martine Quiller, I represent Proxate. We've a ship and, uhh, we need a Captain. What ship? The Lilith. The Lilith. She's a 100 years old. And seaworthy. We've had her certified. It's the African run. New Galveston to Lagos. Right through the hurricane belt. And the season is just beginning I know, but the Lilith is fast. I'm told she can out run any storm if she has the right Captain. She doesn't. And we have heard that you are so experienced. Oh, dear. Then you've also heard that I'm not entitled to command. I can change that. Who's Sean Murdoch? The name you were born with will keep you ashore forever. Sean Murdoch will get you to sea a working Captain. Uhh, you needn't worry. Proxate takes care of its own. Even in jail? Next week, we become the first corporation since Disney to join the UN. We make our own laws. Thank you. Congratulations Captain. Coming Captain Murdoch? Watchman!? Captain Murdoch, your crew. I know you. Nigel Chan. Second Mate. Welcome aboard, Captain. Who's this? Carl Santiago. Our Engineer. Are you a naval man? Was. Seen action? On the Princess Di, Third Gulf War. Well, you'll be looking forward to a peaceful voyage. I hope so, Sir. Put him in irons. Who are you? Barry Lang, Sir. I'm your Ensign. Hey you... Make yourself useful. Willie Chaney, Captain. Communications, Navigation. What are we running here Mr. Chaney? Check it out. Got a Baby. Original equipment, 86 years old. Baby likes Captain Murdoch. Hello, Captain Murdoch. Kill it. Sleep Baby. Sleep. Baby likes Captain Murdoch. Fetal neural computer linkage was banned 40 years ago. You keep her out of your head. Voice only, understand? Skull surfers don't cut it. An addict? See for yourself. How does it feel? Oh, it's whatever you like. You jack in once, just once. God help you. Yes, Sir. Uh, no Sir, Not me Sir. Okay, Babbby. Let's dance. I'll show you everything. I don't think all this is really necessary, Captain. I inspect cargo and crew. It's the code. Never ignore it. And just why are they all wearing discipline collars? Say hello to the criminally insane. Slavery. Flex with me, Captain. They're not slaves. They're volunteers. Actually, that's true, we have the consent forms. It's all perfectly legal. This is Proxate's core business. We operate prisons. We've got it down to a science, absolute control. Good. They you'll see to it that my engineer remains undamaged. No problem. Gunner. This is the top con. Absolute control. Very good. Now what's our cargo? Synthetic protein. For the Nigerian reconstruction. That war's over, isn't it? And its legacy of famine is just beginning. Tarkis, your convicts need a lesson in lashings. You heard him Gunner, lesson in lashings. Hmm, First Mate. Have you any objections to working a convict ship? You're hired. No. Welcome aboard. Well, Captain... the ship is yours. Enjoy. Good-bye, Miss Quiller. One big happy family. Right. In case, you haven't noticed the crew's a joke and the ship's even worse, so we'll all be standing watch and doing the grunt work. We'll inspect the ship to make sure she's seaworthy. And conduct repairs if she isn't. Two weeks. Well, I suggest you get some sleep. We sail at dawn. Martine, you drive me crazy. I know. So, you gonna miss me? Yeah. Promise? I've something for you, just a little going away present. A ring, how romantic. You sick woman. Just a little something so you won't forget me. I tried to get the right size, but, uhh... maybe we should try it on, huh? Sean Murdoch. Why not? Murdoch is damaged. Major damaged. Insane. But you can control him. What if I get sea sick? This is my private line. Call me. Anywhere. And I will make you explode. Alright then, ready? Port engine ahead one-eighth. Port engine ahead one-eighth. Course set, south by south east. Winds from the west, 10 knots. Engines to cruising. Set rudder to standard. Engines to cruising. Set rudder to standard. Tarkis? Escort Mr. Santiago to my quarters. Now, what's all this about? My father was on the Jason Acorn. You've got two choices, submit to my authority, or return to Mr. Tarkis's loving care. Understood, Captain. Necklace. I got this from a sea witch in Rio. Pure silver. Still see the blood stains. Seal it. Now get back to work! Why didn't you just leave the collar on him? First time? I'll never understand why guys like you can fall in love with the sea. There's nothing there, no structure. Well, well... We're leaking? A plumbing problem more likely. Let's find out, shall we? In there? Keep your boots on. What are those lumps? Brown trout. You'll find a drain about there, reach down and give it a feel. Jesus. Rat! Rat! Rat! Injured man, lacerations to the face and neck, level 2. Easy, easy, easy. Sew him up. What happened? I don't really know. It was a rat, I expect. Bit him while we were checking out a plumbing problem. This'll hurt. Don't like needles much. Test him for rabies. Put somebody else on the plumbing. Okay, okay, there we go. Almost there. Felt like it burnt. I'll tell her. The Lilith's a 100 years old. 86 Ms Proxate says. 86 and seaworthy. To Proxate. What happened to your kid? Rat bite. That's a big rat. Check it for rabies? Checking Baz, but there's not much point. If it's rabies, he'll burn. Just like the Taranis. What's that? The Taranis. It's a merchant ship. It was 1673. Her captain was an Englishman named Platt, her crew were scum. Scum. Her cargo was slaves. She was shipping them from Africa to Cuba. She set sail one day, but she never made it to the next port. Why? The Captain betrayed the code. They say that she was no more than a mile out when the fire started. Platt thought he'd gone to hell, maybe he had. But still he ploughed on even with the sails ablaze. He was yelling from the bridge, cursing at God and the devil. The Taranis never sank. They say she's out there still roaming the seas. A ship caught in hell. Captain insane. That's a lot of crap. Of course, you know everything there is to know Mr. Tarkis. But we are damned. Damned, if we ignore the truth. Captain... Captain to deck 3 port side. I was fixin' the plumbing and I found this. A bomb! Can you kill it? Yeah, you got uhh, wire cutters? What do you make of it? Cheap junk. Old world army surplus, 2092 to 2096 tops. There's enough Semtex 3 to blow the ship in half. And send us straight to the bottom. Look like the fuel storage blew up. It's a remote control detonator. You can see an amateur set this. That means there's someone somewhere with a button. Santiago, can you wire it up to a bell or something? I want to know exactly when we're supposed to go down. Captain! The weather's picking up. I'll be right there. Hey Murdoch, this is no small problem. Someone is trying to sabotage us. Well, you're in charge of security, you figure it out. Anything else? Yeah, you never set just one bomb. I'm gonna take some of my guards and anybody you can spare, start searchin' the ship. We got one, let's find the others. Martine. We got a little problem. John, I'm at a party. You think it can wait? Martine, we found a bomb on board. A powerful bomb. I'm glad you're there to take care of it, John. We're searching the ship right now. But you have already found the bomb. Of course, but who would do this, Martine? John, never forget the competition. Any ideas? Just keep an eye on Murdoch. Right. Bombs. I can handle findin' bombs, but I don't want no rats. Just no rats. Bazzer report. Nothin' Sir. Mr. Chan? Green corridor, port side clean, Sir. Making my way to engineering. Willie? Winds veering .5? north. Gust to 150 and rising, still gonna get worse. Permission to jack in, Captain. Denied. But Captain, if I could jack into the system. Denied. Captain, Santiago. I've wired a light and buzzer to the detonator. They'll flash and sound if someone tries to blow the bomb. Gunner, the main line. Make it fast. Tarkis, report! Murdoch, we've got some cargo loose. Can't you steady this tub? Negative, this is a storm, you know? Get that cargo secure, dammit. Shit. Stand back! Stand back if you want your necklace easy! Use a pipe. Here we go! Come on. Now secure this cargo. Wind veering south 7?. Captain, we're losing power. Engine room. Number 2 cooling system down! How long? Hour, maybe two. Jesus! What the fuck is? Mr. Tarkis, I've found another bomb! I'm on my way, Chan, notify the Captain. Tarkis, report. It seems to identical to the first bomb. No, it's inverse wiring. Jesus! Tarkis, cut it now! Tarkis? All dry, Captain. Good. At the height of a storm. ...extravagant celebrations as Proxate prepares its transition from a good corporate citizen to nationhood with the right to grant citizenship and create armed forces. The inauguration of Proxate into the UN will be overseen by Secretary General Carnel Larouse and Proxate's President Manxx Clifton. Quiller? God, that party was interminable. Fitting welcome for our new President. Well? Damn. Nigeria. Call our petroleum people there. Yo, Captain. Entering Nigerian territorial waters right now. Good thank you. Attention all hands, we are entering the territorial waters of Nigeria. We should make land fall in approximately... 10 hours. 10 hours. Remain at your posts, refreshments are on the way. Attention the Lilith. Attention the Lilith. This is Lagos Marine Command. Turn back. You are in violation of Nigerian territorial waters. I repeat turn back. Halt your engines immediately or we will open fire. All engines to idle. Aye, Sir. Colonel, this is Captain Murdoch. I have a signed landing agreement. Permission has been rescinded. Colonel our ship is weakened. Please, grant us safety. You must leave our waters at once. This is an offense against the Maritime Code. God, I've lost him, try and get him back. Hard starboard. Mr. Tarkis, is there a reason why the Lilith is a little unwelcome in Nigerian waters? Take over. Hey, sailor. Martine, the Nigerian's are shooting missiles at us. Murdoch? What did Murdoch do? For God's sake, Martine, first there's bombs in the boat. Now they're shootin' missiles at us. What the hell is going on? - How many what? - How many? Bombs. Plural. How many? Martine, call the Nigerians and make them stop. Now. John, I'm on it, relax. Mayday, Captain? Captain? Damn. Mayday! Mayday Baby, Mayday. Mayday Baby, Mayday. Baby's out of control! Satellite nav is dead, radar's dead, communications' dead, uplink's dead. Who jammed Baby? Good thing you weren't jacked in. Bazzer report. Mr. Chan? Check them out. Right. Both of them. Down! Get us the hell out of here! Remain calm or die. Now get back in your cage. Captain, the hull's been breached. Take the wheel. Make a run for it. She better not be coming apart. Get a move on. Hurry. Can you repair it? Unless it goes past the watertight bulkhead. I'll check the other compartments. Evacuate this area. What the hell is goin' on here? Proxate's taking care of their own. Get these men out of here. No risks, that's policy. Now, evacuate this area. Attention, escaped convict heading for level 2. Escaped convict. Watch your ass. Tell me your position one. Who the hell knows? Somewhere in the middle, near the bottom. Well? No, not well. Damn. Bring it through the centre. That's good, take the lid off. Jesus. Alright. It's ordinary industrial waste. Tip it up. They call it Clarion. The sores; accelerated necrosis. It was only used once illegally, when the Texas Confederacy wiped out Syria. Yes. Bio warfare. Clarion is a 20-minute-plague. It's death in 20 minutes. Yes. Tom, not that way, it leads to the sea. Sick. It hurts. Get away from him, he's infected. You're infected now. Burn him. Burn all of them. If this is Clarion why aren't we all dead? If it had become gaseous, we would be. It's supposed to dissipate after 20 minutes. 20 minute plague. By then, it wipes out a division. Well, I thought Clarion was banned a long time ago, well before the Third Gulf War. The ban was a joke. We also discovered a troublesome characteristic, Captain. Clarion does not go benign in sea water. In fact, it thrives So, if we sink and these cylinders leak... Bastards. I could pull their hearts out. I didn't know we were transporting Clarion. Didn't you? Just why are you here? To protect a simple cargo of liquid protein? I knew about the toxic waste. The Nigerians were supposed to take that off our hands. That was our deal. But I didn't know about the Clarion. Who would put a deadly cargo on a worthless ship? Who would have access to sabotage Baby and put bombs in our hold? Who? There's only one logical answer, Mr. Tarkis. You're twisting this all around Murdoch. Proxate is in business for profit. We were never supposed to reach Nigeria. What you're talking about is a total loss. Ever heard of insurance? This ship is crewed by people who won't be missed. You're wrong, Murdoch, and I'm gonna prove it. Good job. Captain, what happened to the Jason Acorn? I trusted someone. I paid the price in full. The crew paid worse. Maybe. It was my responsibility, I was the Captain. There were owners. Verhoven Shipping, Clifton's operation. She certified the Acorn. But I'll tell you that ship wasn't seaworthy. Clifton? Seems history repeats itself, Sir. My dad was on the Acorn. The ship was garbage, you were Captain, you worked for Manxx Clifton. And now I'm here, this ship is garbage, you're Captain, and you're working for Clifton again. Clifton? No. Status, Mr. Chaney? It's a mess. I'm trying. Calm down, Willie. It's just... How's Baby? Baby's alive. It's about the best I can say I'm feeding her myself, but... But what? The radar's dead. No navigational systems at all. Phones dead. Uplinks dead. All I've got working so far is the ship's intercom. Give me something. Maybe. It'll take days though. You've got about 1 hour. Right now, I need to talk to Baby. Well? No. Not well. So, that bitch didn't sink. I thought she was virtually going down of her own accord. What went wrong? Fail safes failed. No risks, babe. Find a way. Ready. Go. Baby, Baby? Can you hear me? Baby sick. Open up! Who changed your mayday parameters, Baby? Murdoch hurting Baby. Baby can't go there. Can't go there. Talk to me, Baby. Can't go there. I want the name. Hurts. God dammit, I need some answers. Who changed your parameters? Who planted those bombs? Who Baby? Just gimme a God damn name. Can't go there. Monsters there. Just show me. Show me. Clifton. Hurts. It's alright, it's alright. It's alright, Baby. It's alright, go to sleep. Go to sleep. Can we get you anything, Mr. Tarkis? Law for the Ship Master. If a Captain cannot fulfill his charter, he must return his ship to her rightful owners. The right of innocent passage, Article 19... Article 95 of the Law of the Sea from the Third United Nations Convention states that warships on the high seas have complete immunity from the jurisdiction of any state, other than the flag state. If Proxate is a state, we are now her warship. In the event where a ship cannot avoid engagement by hostile forces, then the Captain may at his discretion declare the ship in a state of war. The Captain says we stay. And I say we get somewhere safe. Navigation expert, are you? No. You drive the boat and I'll get you a commission at Proxate City. So let's just find some land somewhere, okay? Nearest land is only 1,000 metres from here. Straight down. Mr. Tarkis, we have our orders and we obey them, that is all. Anything else is mutiny. Ladies and gentlemen. Lady and gentlemen. As of now, this ship is on combat status. Anyone concerned about the legalities. Captain. What's that, Cookie? Don't interrupt me. For God sakes, get out of here. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. This is crazy. Let's just get the hell out of here. Okay, come on. You're not paying attention Mr. Tarkis. You're drunk, Murdoch. Huh, huh. There's a clever guy. A clever company boy whose dick got us into all this trouble. You got something to say to me, Murdoch, you just got to say it. Well, as a matter of fact, I do. This ship is destined to go down. It won't be your first time. That's interesting that you should bring up the Jason Acorn. In heaven, they'll say I was Captain I'm to blame and I'll agree. But in hell. In hell, they'll smile and greet me. "Welcome, Captain.", they'll say. "Manxx Clifton is waiting over there. Do what you need to make her pay." I live for the day I go to hell. Murdoch, you're damaged. You're gonna kill everyone on this ship. You think you're one of the elite, Tarkis? Hear this. Life is cheap in Proxate City and when Ms. Poison put you on this boat, she signed your death warrant. That is bullshit. What I wanna know is why? Murdoch, what we'd all like to know is if there is a Captain running this ship. Not some drunk paranoid schizophrenic whose lost touch with reality. Hundreds of years of accumulated wisdom are my reality. Okay, you go on combat status. Fine. But there's got to be a port somewhere nearby. If someone gets us there, I'll guarantee them a commission in Proxate City. A commission in Proxate City. He-he. Brilliant, didn't I tell you he was a clever lad. Ahh well, let's have a drink to us, eh? For he's a jolly good fellow For he's a jolly good fellow Martine. We have a little problem, Murdoch's declared the Lilith at war. That's not a problem, John. There's been a power shift in Lagos. You'll be cleared to land in a couple of days. There's more, it's not good. Martine, they know about the cargo. What? They know about the toxic waste. That's not a problem, John. We knew someone might discover the waste. That's why we chose Murdoch. His history gives us deniability. Murdoch learns that Clifton, whom he blames for the sinking of the Jason Acorn, has just become President of Proxate. He wants, he needs to get even. But the bomb was obviously sabotage. The competition, John, they've reached Murdoch. It's their chance to discredit us before nationhood is finalized. I want you in charge. Arrest Murdoch, assume command. Otherwise, take no risks. Clear? Yes, clear. Call me as soon as you have control. Right. Thank you, Mr. Tarkis. Now we have a navigational lock on Proxate City. North by north east set manually. Engines to full. Engines to full. Well, the truth is we don't really know what to expect. I suppose they could bomb us from a plane. It'd show on the sky grid, there'd be questions. So they want to keep it as quiet as possible. Yes, like when I was on the Princess Di. Tarkis! He's gone. Idiot! Hi, Baby. Hello, Mr. Tarkis. You okay, feelin' better? Baby feels better. Thank you, Mr. Tarkis. This'll just take a minute. Why Proxate hit Baby, Mr. Tarkis? Baby hurt, Proxate bad. That's enough, Tarkis. It's over for you. Move away from Baby. Move, move, move! I can prove this is all a big mistake, Murdoch. I could execute you for mutiny. I have an illegal link to all top secret files in Proxate. I can access it through Baby. I call Quiller, Baby uses that link to tap into the cyber mains. And what does that prove? That'll tell us who's doing what and why. Why should I trust you? What have you got to loose. If I'm right Proxate will give us assistance. If you're right... then I'll start working with you. Hey, sailor. I've taken control as instructed. What did Murdoch do? Not much, he was drunk. Didn't know what hit him. Is the Lilith secure? Yes, Martine. Everything is under control. The sea cruise thing is wearing a little thin. Understood, sailor. Just sit tight. Help is under way. Martine, your wish is my command. Got it, I'm in. As it should be, John. Keep the Lilith for me. I don't get it, this is a secure file, but that's ordinary equipment from the Third Gulf War. Stop, I've seen him. That's the Texas Confederacy in the Syrian action. 95% of those troops were killed. It was Clarion. I know, because I was on the Princess Di looking for survivors. No one thought Syria had Clarion. Worse, there were stories that the Clarion was ours, that it was deployed illegally. And proving uncontrollable devastated our own as well as the enemy. Rumour unproven. You mean forgotten. Those bastards are gonna pay. It's too hot to move and too hard to destroy without chemical markers. Wouldn't look too good though would it for Proxate, if the whole world knew? So now they have to kill us all. I was loyal. I trusted them. You can serve them, Tarkis. But loyalty doesn't make you one of them. Cute, Martine. The sky grid shows the Lilith heading our way. That's impossible. Tarkis has Murdoch under arrest. I expect it will be a small hastily-assembled force. They'll want to strike deep and pin us down. They'll go below decks and plant a bomb with the Clarion cylinders and withdraw. I expect we lure them below decks and hit and run. No, I think we'd be better off just running, Captain. It's not gonna be a regular unit. It's gonna be Proxate's latest contribution to the war industry. They'll fly it in from the Boudicea plant, a cybernetic killing machine. It's unstoppable. Unless you believe in miracles, we're all dead. No, wait a minute, I heard of that. It's impossible; it's top secret. Boudicea was out of control, like Clarion. I had her decommissioned. A menace to our image. Boudicea was mine, should have been told. I couldn't take that chance, I had the babe deactivated and stowed aboard the Lilith for disposal. Along with Clarion and Murdoch... and anything else that might deter the achievement of nationhood. Well, she's there now. I could reactivate and control her. We could sink the Lilith right now. Just do it, Martine. Fucking detonator. As of now you are no longer prisoners. Now that doesn't mean to say that you're free just yet. This ship requires that you fight for your lives. You will do so under my command. If you live, I will set you free, that's the law. Until then you will obey my orders and those of my officers. To hell with you, Captain. Tonight, you will dine in the mess hall. Mr. Santiago here will show you to your new quarters. Alright, ladies move it. You can leave your collars at the door. Okay, boys, heads up. Our only chance is to take her out of the sky. If she lands, we're all dead. You're getting quite good at this. Fly it in from the Boudicea Plant. A cybernetic killing machine. No, wait a minute, I've heard of that. Oh, no, no. She's arrived. Bazzer, say again. She's onboard now. Holy shit. Oh, shit. One dead in mess hall. Keep those reports coming into me. Yes, Sir. Whatever she is, she's heading starboard side to the stern and down. I'm gonna follow. Be specific, Baz. Where is she? Gimme a heading, Baz. Christ! There's more bodies everywhere. She's... she's so fast. It's like time is missing around her. I don't know where she is. I've lost her. Tarkis level 3, I'm near the elevator. Squad 2. Squad 2, come back. Damn. Captain, Squad 1 is dead; I'm getting no report from Squad 2. She's on the port side green corridor. One, no two dead. Damn it, what the hell is this thing? I see her, she's so... So, I can't focus, I think she's here. This is Squad 4, I see her. I see her. Several dead. They're all dead. 12 convicts, hardly put up a fight. I've lost her. She's on deck 5 moving to the bow. I found her. Where is it, Baz? Level 3, vent shaft intersect. Hide Bazzer! Damn. Follow the monsters home, Baby. Hey! Cover me, Gunner. Mr. Tarkis. Mr. Tarkis. We've got another bomb. It's a different type in a black casing, smaller than before. The LCD numbers are moving very fast. Don't touch that bomb. It's not the same as the others. It can't be disarmed. Fine. I'll cut out the wall around it. Smoke? Bridge, we're gonna need fire control. Okay bitch, let's do it. You stupid bitch! If you sink this ship, you'll kill the world. Here I am. Oh my God. Structural. This is your Captain speaking, this ship carries a cargo of Clarion. It multiplies its potency in sea water. To sink is to destroy the ocean. The ship will not sink with the Clarion aboard. That is an order. It's my last order. What the fuck is...? Momma's coming, little Buddie. Time to go, sweetheart. Oh, John. What were you gonna do, let me die with the rest of these people? Why should I save you, John? You sold me out. After the fact, I was loyal to you. I loved you. I loved you, too. No, no, wait. She's got the detonator. Yes. Come with me. Why save the world when you can own it? Now. The Maritime Code is perfectly clear. If a Captain cannot fulfill his commission, he must return his ship to her owners. Mr. Chan, I've got a charter for you. She couldn't swim. She went down like a rock. Mr. Chan borrowed Quiller's plane. The Clarion is safely with the UN. Let it up, Murdoch. You've made your point. Manxx Clifton. Even now the bureau dregs of the UN are revoking Proxate's national status. I can't believe they let a drunkard, raging about some quaint antique code, defy progress. I'm returning the ship to her owners. Oh, you always were a righteous bastard. A man in search of crucifixion. What the hell did you think you were doing? That Clarion could have destroyed the planet. Very dramatic, Murdoch. But my scientists don't agree with your scientists. This Earth is a resilient place. And we should have been extinct 200 years ago. What about the crew of the Jason Acorn? I'll see you in hell for that. I own the ship. I didn't sink her. She wasn't seaworthy. You certified her. And you didn't know, Murdoch? You couldn't tell she wasn't seaworthy? Face it, you needed the work, you turned a blind eye. Financial necessity, I understand. You broke your code I didn't break mine. Proxate bad. Baby angry. Don't be afraid, not all fires burn. Captain! Captain. Fire! Calm now. I saw it. This ship, it was on fire and I... I know, I know. She's been burning for some 300 years. The Lilith. A retched tub. Crew of convicts and for officers scum. And the Captain. Murdoch. Named for the dead before he even set sail. Now this was at the beginning of the 22nd century. Captain Murdoch thought that he was hauling a cargo of liquid protein destined for Lagos. He set sail one day, but he never made it to port. What happened? Well, some say he went down with the ship. Others say he went insane. I say he went waltzing. He just danced into the flames.
