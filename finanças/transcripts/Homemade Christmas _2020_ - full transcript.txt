But until I met Kurt, there was one problem I could never solve: fixing my own heart instead of just running towards the next challenge. I'm not very poetic. I wasn't very good in my English class. I, I... It's not finished. Now that your heart's fixed, what does it say? It says... that I'm sorry and to keep Christmas helping... and to do things with you so we can build something together. [chuckle] You inspire me. You're pretty great. You complement me. I am not an accessory. You talk back to me. You terrify me, in a good way. I realize the best part of me is us versus the world. I realized if we just put two percent of our neurotic passions towards each other, what a special life that would be. Are you up for the challenge? Always. ♪ More. ♪ captions by sas harris
