The melodies are quaint and primitive, but you must learn to appreciate not only the sociological value, but the simple purity of emotion in the song. Good afternoon, Dean pembroke. I wanted to catch you today, Dr. Penleric. I wanted to tell you that the appointment committee has reviewed your application for full professor, and we've concluded unanimously that we cannot offer you the position. However, we hope you will continue on as an associate professor, at your current salary level, of course. Why, may I ask, am I being passed over again? It is not customary to be asked to defend our position, Dr. Penleric. It appears we have an opportunity to offer the position to the eminent English musicologist and ballad collector Cyrus whittle, who, as you know, has almost single-handedly created a revival of the English folk song-- Dean pembroke, excuse me. What is it, professor aldrich? Nothing, sir. I just stopped by for a few words with Dr. Penleric. Well, I was just leaving. Good day, Dr. Penleric. I argued for you, Lily. As emphatically as I dared. I have waited longer and published more than anyone else in this department. Frankly, I was the only man for you. Really? Dean pembroke said the vote was unanimous. I was afraid someone would suspect something. Now, Dr. Whittle is a brilliant man. Of course he is. That's not the point. Lily, I've arranged the family's whole summer so I can come into town to see you every week. I won't be here, Wallace. Well, where are you going? As far away as possible. Please don't go away! I know how disappointed you must be, my darling, but-- Lily, wait! Why don't I meet you at your apartment? My wife won't be home until quite late. Are you mad, Lily? What if someone walked in? You coward! Backing my appointment was the only thing I ever asked you for. But-- You miss elna's sister? Yes, yes, yes, I am. I'm here to take you to clover. I'm fate honeycutt. What's your name? Hello, i'm Dr. Lily penleric. You're a doctor? That's just fine. We could sure use another healer. I'm not a medical doctor. What kind are you? I'm a, doctor of music. Sort of an expert. Thank you. Well, hop on up, doc. Put your foot on the wheel there. I'll help you up. Giddyap! Giddyap! What if we meet another wagon coming down the mountain? That would be somethin'. Someone's playing music? Lily! Eleanor... It's been so long. Yes. I thought you said it was only 5 miles to clover? She meant mountain miles. It used to take 3 days to get up here. This is my sister Lily. Lily, this is my colleague and friend, Harriet tolliver. How do you do? How do you do? And this is deladis slocumb. Deladis has no family, so we get to keep her here, full-time. How do you do, ma'am? How do you do. Elna's told me so much about you. Elna? That's what everyone here calls me. It's caught on with me, too. Well, I suppose it's a lot better than "little elf," which is what I used to call her. Ha ha! Y-You must be exhausted. I am. Excuse me. Would you like to rest before supper? Could you help me, dear? Yes, I'm sorry. Thank you so much. It's very hot. I... Along with the basic curriculum, we also teach hygiene and nutrition to the girls. And music, of course. Deladis, why don't you serve the tea? Deladis, what a beautiful name. That's a real pretty fan. Thank you, dear. It's from Spain. Thank you, dear. Aren't you frightened here? What of? Savage mountaineers? Reports of violence are horrible. Heh! Ha ha ha! Horribly exaggerated, that is. Deladis, why don't you sing one of your pretty songs for my sister? Please, please do! I would like that. ♪ 'Twas in the merry month of may ♪ ♪ when all gay flowers were a-bloomin' ♪ ♪ sweet William on his deathbed lay ♪ ♪ for the love of Barbara Allen ♪ ♪ he sent his servant to the town ♪ ♪ he sent him to her dwellin' ♪ sayin' master's sick and very sick ♪ ♪ and for your sake he's a-dyin' ♪ Deladis, where did you learn that song? My granny gave to me. Was your grandmother from england? You mean across the ocean? No. No. Granny lived and died right here on the mountain. Then, where did she learn it? Granny said she got all those love songs from her mama. Do you know any more ballads? Love songs. I know lots of them. I know lord randal, Jack went a-sailin', two sisters, I know young Anne Lee... Would you sing two sisters,please? It's all right, dear. ♪ Sister, sister come go with me... ♪ Lily, I told you never to call me here. I'm calling as a colleague, Wallace. Where are you? The Southern mountains. What on earth are you doing in such a dreadful place? Never mind that. I'm telephoning because I've made a great discovery-- old English ballads. What are you talking about? The mountain people brought the ballads here over 200 years ago. The same songs that Cyrus whittle's been collecting in england. Songs which haven't been known there for at least 100 years. What of it, Lily? I want you to come home. Don't you understand? Wallace, these may be the purest versions in existence. That's ridiculous. It's true! And I am going to be the first to collect them and to publish them. Nothing I could have said or done would have secured that appointment for you. And nothing you do now will either. Will you help me or not? I've always believed in you, Lily. Good. Well, I need supplies. The collecting must be done scientifically.

See, deladis sings, for the most part, in a Scots-Irish style. But she employs such unusual pitches. And she dwells on notes. Here... Can you hear that? That is so unusual. I have never heard anything like it before. Tell me, is her style of singing, is that typical? Yes, I think it is. Is it really? Fascinating. So what do you think of my school, Lily? Well, I'm afraid I'm no expert... I'm sure it's fine. I'm sure... We are trying to make a difference. Yes, of course. It was mine! Deladis! What happened? Fate, did you do this? That was so cruel. You give her that fancy thing and a whole dollar just for singing. You ain't gave me nothing. Fate, you work for the school, and I think we pay you quite adequately. Then I'll do nothing for doc. Just for the school. Well, then I'll just have to find another boy who's more willing. No, no, Eleanor. Fate does have a point. He has had to work a lot harder since I've been here. That's right, doc. So, how's 50 cents a week then, young man? Well, I don't know. I'll have to think on it. Well, while you're thinking, you can help me pack up the phonograph machine. We're going to bear creek tomorrow. She's going to Viney Butler's. Well, you can't lug that machine all the way up a mountain. We made it this far, didn't we? That was nothing compared to getting up to bear creek. So what am I paying you for? Whoa, whoa. I don't know no ballads. Why, Mrs. Butler, they are the most beautiful songs there have ever been. Songs like lord Thomas and fair ellinor, two sisters, matthy groves? Can't say I know them. Deladis calls them love songs. Nope. You ever hear any such songs, fate? Del knew. But I can't say as I do. Surely, deladis can't be the only keeper of the songs in the mountains? Sorry, can't be of any help to you, ma'am. I would be happy to compensate you, to-to pay you, Mrs. Butler. Good day to you. Hello, Viney. Well, look who's here! Well, you must be elna's sister. Well, yes. Yes, I am. I'm so happy to meet you. I'm Alice Kincaid. Well, how do you do. I'm Lily penleric. What are trudging all the way up here for, child? I wanted to meet Dr. Penleric. I have something for you. Fate, thank you. My family spent summers in asheville. I loved hiking up in the mountains and reading poetry. That's how I met Reese, my husband. He wooed me with ballads and fiddle music. I've been writing them down since I came to live here. You can have them if you like. Thank you. Thank you. They are indeed exactly what I'm looking for, but I'm afraid these haven't been scientifically collected. Well, I can't be sure of your notation, you see, because of the irregular times and the unusual modes and rhythms of the tunes. Of course. I understand perfectly. That is beautiful. Come here, child. You are weak as water. That baby is sucking the life out of you. You've got to eat more. No, I can barely feed the children. Reese gone again? Mrs. Kincaid, thank you. Thank you. Here, now, you make a potion out of this and drink it twice a day. And do not go draggin' all over the place. Viney, the ballads are a precious musical legacy. Why, they're just songs. No, Mrs. Butler, they're not. They're ancient ballads from england and Scotland, and they've been sung for hundreds of years. Well, they say that my great granddaddy come from there. He come over that mountain in 17 and 43. Really? Well, no one knows that these songs are being sung right here in the mountains of America. No one. What of it? Music experts will want to know. So I am going to write them down and publish them in a song book. Well, lord knows I can't read nor write anyhow.

One more time, Viney. I thought you'd done this before? Viney? Tom. Is the day gone already? Sure is. Corn is coming up fine in that back field. This is Dr. Lily penleric. She's miss elna's sister. How do you do? How do you do? Lily is a doctor of music. She's catching my old love songs. She says they're important. Important? Important to who? I'm going to publish them in a song book. No, you're not. Nobody's going to publish my granny's songs. This is my grandson, Tom bledsoe. He's been to the other world, and he thinks he knows a whole lot. Mr. Bledsoe, I am a collector. My intention is to exalt the fine music of these mountains. Exalt? Yes. It means to lift up. You mean exploit. It means to steal. I'm a musicologist, not a thief. My work is to preserve musical culture. First it was the coal and lumber companies coming in here. Now they want to take our music, too. These songs are of great interest to anyone who studies musical heritage. You're gonna get paid for it, ain't you? Yes, I am. See, granny, let me handle this now. I can assure you it will not make me rich. And frankly, I'm the one who's going to all the trouble and the expense of collecting the songs. And I'm the one who has the expertise to write them down and categorize them properly and scientifically. You do, do you? And what's in it for my granny? Her name will appear before each one of the songs which I include in the book as a source from which I have collected it. Malvina Butler, that's what it's gonna say, Tom. Well, you can't collect from my granny unless you pay her. I have offered. She refused. You refused? How can I take money for singin'? My mama used to sing those songs rockin' the young'uns to sleep and leading the cows home. Doctor, i'm asking you kindly-- to leave. Tom! I can give my songs to anybody that I want to. No, you can't. Yes, I can! Besides, it's supper time, and Lily's joining us. No, thank you, Mrs. Butler. Really, I should be heading back to the school. You're going to take my songs and refuse the hospitality of my home? Well, I never! My man's father built this place when he settled here. I've raised 9 children in this cabin. Only two of them still living. I'm sorry. One's working the coal mines up in Virginia, and one's in Missouri. It was good, granny. Tom's a fine musician. Really? He plays the banjo like nobody. Tom? Tom? What's that thing called? That thing? It's a guitar, granny. How many times have I got to tell you? He got it in Cuba, Tom did. In the Spanish war. It's a lovely instrument. Yeah, he's the only one in these parts got one of those things. He makes up songs on it, too. Do you play music, doctor... Or do you just steal other people's? I'm a pianist, Mr. Bledsoe. A pianist? I heard of them. Tom, come on, play some banjo tunes for Lily here. Come on, come on. Please. I would like that. Hilliard, you almost scared me to death. Sorry, Viney. You coming, Tom? I'll be right there. Mr. Bledsoe, where did you learn to play like that? I taught him. I would like to record you on my phonograph machine sometime. No, thank you. I make music to please myself. Never mind Tom. He's like most of those fellas who went to the other world and come back. Just never seem to be the same. They just can't seem to settle down and be happy. Would you show me how to play this? Well, it's all in the picking. Fate, did you see to Alice and her young'uns? Yes, ma'am. I caught 'em a couple of rabbits. We had a fine supper. Good. Good. We have all to do tomorrow. These old songs are coming back to me now. Well, I'm looking forward to it. Lily, um, listen. If you hear a strange cry, like a woman screaming, that's the panther cat. And you're gonna be dead if it gets you. Now what you do is you pull off your clothes one piece at a time, and then you run real hard, and then the panther cat will stop and tear up the clothes that you've dropped in its path to shreds, and that'll save you! Viney, that is ridiculous. What was that? Just an owl. Are you sure? You'll know the panther cry when you hear it. Fate! Damn near got your fool head blowed off. I didn't know you had a still going here. What about her? What about her? Go on, git, both of you. Fate. Yes, sir. Eleanor? Eleanor? Eleanor? I have had the most remarkable day. Lily, I'd like to talk with you. I'm very tired. I don't want to talk. I think we should talk. How could you, Eleanor? You sound so like father. I'm not a child. You're teachers! What kind of an example are you setting? You're disgusting. She's the finest person I've ever known. I suppose...Harriet is a lot older and, um, more experienced than you, so I suppose it's her fault. It's nobody's fault.

I'm not using it at the moment. You see, you gotta save it, Polly, or it'll wear out. My brother's a songcatcher. That's very nice, but I'm afraid he's a bit too little to be a reliable source. Come on, Tommy Lee. You can sing for me. What songs you know? Get the hell out of my yard, Earl giddens. I've been hearing all this excitement about the songcatcher. I came to see for myself. Tom told you we're not selling. He also told you that he'd shoot you on the spot if you came around again. Viney, it's that kind of talk gives city folk a terrible impression of us hillbillies. Isn't that right, miss? Doctorlily penleric. Doctor? Well, Earl giddens, of the mcfarland coal company. Very pleased to make your acquaintance, doctor. It's fine to see an outsider appreciating the charm of our local music. To myself, however, there is nothing like the elegant perfection of a composition by Mr. Johann Sebastian bach. Well, I don't think that such comparisons benefit either tradition. They're apples and oranges. Are you a musician? No, ma'am. I've been down the mountain. I had the privilege of education. Bachelor of sciences. University of north Carolina. Really? I guess I see your point. Maybe you can talk some sense into this stubborn old woman, Dr. Lily. Mrs. Butler? She has no need of my advice. Don't you think she deserves a nice new house in sawyerville? Time to sing and rest? She could even learn to read and write instead of working her fingers to the bone just to get by. I could make a living on a rock if I wanted to. I was born on this mountain, and I'm gonna die on this mountain, and so are you. Git goin', giddens. This place is nothing but a burden for Tom, Viney. You know he was made for other things besides farming. Isabel. Isabel. Go to my place. Take the children to my place. Yes, ma'am. And tell Tom to bring the milk cow. Come on, y'all. Come on. I'll take them, Viney. No! I want you here! Help me. Help me, please, I'm dying. I can't stop the bleeding till I get the baby out. You gotta help me. No, no, no, I couldn't. Well, she can't do it by herself. Come here. Give me your hands. Give me your hands. Now put 'em right here, like that. And when I tell you to, you push, hard. No, no, no. Do it, woman! Ready? Now! Well, I guess the good lord's gonna let us keep you a little while longer. And you've got yourself here another sweet little baby girl. Will she live? Well, it was a struggle there for a bit, but it's in the good lord's hands now. Alice, you're gonna have to keep Reese away from you.

I'm not drunk, I'm a... Celebrating. There's no cause for celebration, Mr. Bledsoe. They could still die. In case it's news to you, doctor, suffering is a woman's lot. I am perfectly well aware of that fact, Mr. Bledsoe. God knows, I wish I weren't. You really are an ignorant drunken lout. You have absolutely no idea what that woman has just been through. Let me tell you something... My wife died in childbirth when we were 16 years old. She bled to death right after I pulled our dead baby out, so don't you tell me what I do and don't know. Dear Wallace, enclosed are 10 of the beautiful ballads I have collected so far. I am sure you will realize what a remarkable discovery this is. The songs are virtually intact according to the oldest known versions, with wonderful idiosyncratic local changes in a lyric or phrase here or there. Best wishes, Lily. Lord! Your playing is beautiful. Well, actually that was one of my tunes. Dexter here just took it over and made it his own. Such striking rhythms. Thank you, ma'am. I'm Lily penleric. She's a musicologist. Mr.... Dexter speaks, ma'am. Well, how do you do? Would you... Look at del. She's all bug-eyed. Ain't you ever seen a colored man before? Where would I have? Where you all headed? Rose gentry's. I'm gonna help doc, here, with writing down Rose' ballads. We're going everywhere the sweet music is. Rose? Rose lives way off back of beyond. You'll never get there with that load. You can't tell this woman nothing, Tom. Well, aren't you lucky? Sitting around all day, getting drunk, playing music. How lovely. Yes, I am. See, that's what you outlanders don't understand. See, life is for enjoying, not just getting and working and getting and working. We do indeed have very different notions of what enjoyment is. Wait. Fate, careful. Stop, stop. I told you we couldn't get there with this thing. Where's your pioneer spirit, fate? We can't give up. Come on, let's keep trying. No, del. She's crazy. I've been lugging this thing everywhere it don't belong. I'm not risking life and limb for no stupid songs. I need these recordings. I need them, right, deladis? Doc, no one's ever tried to pull a thing like this up here. Until now. Come along. We'll show young Mr. Honeycutt what you can achieve if you don't give up. You... I will not give up! Come along. Please, fate. Come with us. I decided to take your offer, Earl. A dollar an acre and jobs for me and my boys. Why, if it ain't the songcatcher. Dr. Lily, you sure do get around, don't you? Nice to see you again, Mr. Giddens. Mr. and Mrs. Gentry, I'm Lily penleric. We heard you might be coming this way. Viney says doc is awful nice and you should sing for her. Doctor, uncle cratis is the one who knows about every love song there is. Except uncle cratis got the calling. He don't hold to singing no more. I'm sorry, we seem to have come at a bad time. No. We've about finished here. I said I'd take a dollar an acre. Well, now, parley, that was before I knew the land was used up. Well, I wouldn't be selling if it weren't. I appreciate that, but Mr. Mcfarland would have my head if I gave that much. Most I could give is, say, 50 cents an acre. What's that come to? How many acres you got again? About 100, my daddy always said. $50?! That's all? That's criminal, Mr. Giddens. Don't butt in where you don't belong. Now, the only way these folks are going to better themselves is to get the hell off this mountain and give up their backward ways. Is that what your education taught you? To hate your own people? Damn you! You're about as mean as a copperhead. And I sleep like a snake, too, with both eyes open. Leave the boy, Earl. Get on outta here. The deal's done. You got my word. Git. Good day, doctor. Is that any way to settle anything, you stupid boy! That man would steal the dime off a dead man's eyes.

Fortunately for us, reverend, we're not under your jurisdiction. I'm beginning to understand your appreciation of the local crafts, Mrs. Mcfarland. It's a beautifully made piece. I have several like it. She'll bankrupt me with her collecting. The clover school is a model, but the church is better equipped to educate. I endorse the English idea: We must educate by example. If we teach these ruffians to serve tea properly, they will want refinement. Seek it out. I believe we must ask the mountain people what they want and what they need. That is the enlightened point of view. Educating these savages is a waste of money. If you want to help these children, you should get them out of their hovels and put them to work. There's nothing like a day's wages to help make for advancement. It's a beautiful land, isn't it, Mr. Mcfarland? It's one of the largest untapped coal deposits in the Southern mountains, miss tolliver, and soon I'm gonna own it. And with my coal mines will come towns, roads, railroads, churches, even a few more schools. Although I don't share the lofty ideals of you ladies, I would like to make a small donation to the clover school. Say, $500. Thank you. But we couldn't possibly accept such a gift despite our need. Yes, it's essential that we avoid all political affiliations to maintain the trust of the community. As far as I know, water pumps don't have political affiliations. Mr. Mcfarland, I thought you supported Christian education. I support progress, reverend merriweather. And I also appreciate what these ladies have accomplished. I think this school is the loveliest. The way miss tolliver and miss penleric have used the local crafts to decorate. Are you aware of the folk arts movement that is sweeping New York and London? I'm quite a collector. Doc's collecting songs. Really? Yes, I am. Umm... It's beautiful. So refined. Was this painted by a local? I knew you would appreciate it. Do you know I have sent a dozen of these to a gallery in New York? The dealer is very excited. Look everybody. Our musical entertainment is here. Hi, will. Hey, will. Everybody, this is will.

It's beautiful. Yeah. I would like to discuss something with you seriously. Serious? What is it? It's about my work. Actually, it's about my book. I believe that you can win public sentiment over with your music. Public sentiment? Yes. Let me tell you something. We're not really interested in what you people out there think about us. Well, you should be. Yeah? What I'm trying to say is that when my book is published, I believe that the mountain people will be seen in a very different light. What light is that, may I ask? Well, the common view is that there is no culture here, and that the people are dirty, ignorant, and savage. You forgot illiterate and inbred. The only way to preserve our way of life up here is to keep your way of life down there. That is the way that you kill something, by shutting it up. You know what? You just don't understand, and you never will. We just want to be left alone. See? Then the mountain ways will die. We'll see. I don't want to fight with you. Well, me neither. We just keep getting off on the wrong foot, don't we? Good night. Can I take my wrong feet and walk you home? No. I can find my own way, thank you. I promised miss elna. Well, in case you hadn't noticed, I am the big sister. Not elna. I'd noticed. I'd noticed. Whoa! Whoa! Here you go. Why won't you admit it was you--give me that. It was you. It wasn't me. It had to be the panther. Either that or maybe you... Maybe you imagined it. I did not imagine it. It was as real as you and me. Why aren't you married? Why aren't you? I've been married twice. My second wife died of lung fever. I'm sorry. I'm a jinx for a woman, Lily. I'm not your average woman.

We're making a book. Cratis got religion. He don't do no singing no more. Well, perhaps if I spoke with him. Cratis. ♪ Uncle cratis you're going to burn in hell, Josie Moore. Mr. Kincaid? Do I know you, woman? I'm your wife's friend. You all go on. We got no songs here. Your family needs you, Mr. Kincaid. Reese belongs here with me. Go on. How can I thank you? Alice, you don't have to. I've barely been able to keep body and soul together since Reese left again. And people been helping out as best they can, but... Well, now that Clementine mcfarland's collecting your paintings, others will as well. You know, maybe I should take the children down to asheville. I mean, if what you say is true, I could provide for us in a big town. Hello, Alice. Daddy? Reese! Daddy, daddy. Well, hey, big man. Hey, little Beth. Hey. Hey. You look pretty today, Alice. You remember Dr. Penleric, don't you? Mr. Kincaid. Hey, del. Hey. Hey, del. "It is... It is dep... Dep..." What are you doing reading other people's writing? "It is deplorable... "Deplorable that the literature of the ballad "has attracted so much more attention than the music. "The two elements should never be disassociated. "The music and text are one and indivisible, "and to sever one from the other is to remove the priceless gem from its beautiful setting." What are you laughing at? She's just saying our songs are finer than frog hair. You're going soft in the head, Tom. Yeah, maybe. Ladies. Hello. What are you doing here? ...i-i brought you something. You shouldn't have. Well, I did. Warm today? Yes. Tom. Why don't you advise my sister to join us at the picnic this afternoon? I haven't had any luck. Perhaps you might. What? And leave her work? Deladis? Are you ready? Umm... I ain't goin'. It's too hot and muggy for a picnic. All right. Suit yourself. Let me show you this here noter. A what? Noter. You take that in your left hand and you play these strings. Let's go for a walk. Yes. We'll leave you two to your music lesson. You know, it ain't none of my business, but... Miss Harriet and miss elna... They're, umm... What? Sweethearts, I guess you call it. Don't be ridiculous. Well, listen, it don't bother me none. I know it riles most people right up. It don't bother me none. I'm sure it's only because they're so isolated. Who else would they be with? Well, certainly not a mountain man. I see you two. Now, you quit that. Hey, Johnson. I got a letter here for the doctor. She ain't here right now, but you can leave it. No, no. You see this here word? That means it's important, and she's got to get it right away. Urgent? I can read. She's gone over to alton's creek. I'll take it over. You do that for me, old fate? Sure, Johnson, sure. I'll go with you. No. You stay here. Why? Because I said. I'm coming with you. Now, you deliver it into her own hands. I will, I will. Thank you. Bye. Bye. Sure, I'll deliver the letter, doc. You can't do that. That's doc's letter. You give me that. Come and get it. Del! You come back here! Del? God. God. God. No! Elna, we have to get back to the school. Elna! Fate! Elna! Johnson said it was urgent. Dear Lily... It is with great pride that I write. I took the Liberty of showing the ballads you sent me to Cyrus whittle. He immediately confirmed the importance of your discovery, and thinks it imperative that the ballads be collected urgently. The Dean has secured the funds. You'll be thrilled to know that whittle himself intends to collect the songs and insisted that you continue as his assistant. Assistant! Please respond immediately. Regards, Wallace. Uncle cratis is preaching the gospel tomorrow. Yes, dear. Can I wear my new green calico? Harriet, no! Run! Run! Run! My god! My glasses! No, no. Lily! Lily! Good-bye, my darling girl. Good lord. Go away. Elna? How am I going to live without her? Perhaps you could find her. She swore if anyone ever found out, she'd disappear. My Harriet... I'm sorry. I'm so sorry. Hey, doc! Look! Doc! Y'all don't have to believe me, but you gotta believe the word of god. Now I know you believe in the Bible, and the Bible says, "for her sins have reached unto heaven, "and god hath remembered her iniquities. "Therefore shall her plagues come in one day: "Death and mourning and famine, "and she shall be utterly destroyed with fire." Amen! Glory! "For strong is the lord god that judgeth her." Amen. Where did you get to? I was looking for you! Thou hast polluted the land with thy whoredoms and with thy wickedness! Amen! I'm gonna bust you up, hilliard! Tom! They're the whores of Babylon come to tempt us, Tom! Now, that snake right there and that little weasel right next to him, they're the ones who set fire to the school! And all this while them women and children were still inside! They're evil women! Are you gonna listen to them, or are you gonna listen to me? I am ashamed of you boys! I ain't never seen nothing but good come out of that school. Them women were sent by the devil hisself! Only wickedness comes of book learning. Amen! Cratis! I ain't never had a chance to learn nothin', and my kids ain't neither, 'cause they's always working too hard, keeping food on the table. But I got grandbabies as smart as any others, and I want them to have a chance. That's the devil speaking through him! Amen! Amen! Reese Kincaid! You said you'd never leave me.

Elna, will you be all right if I leave? So soon? Why don't you come with me? You can live as you please in a big city. I've thought about it. I want to reopen the school.

I'm sorry, too. I'm sorry about that school. I'm sorry about your book. You made most of us feel real proud. Thank you. I'm sure someone else will come and write down all the songs. You giving up? I realize that it was the voices singing them that I wanted everyone to hear. You going back to your university, then? No, no, I don't think so. Where are you going? I'm not sure, um... Come with me? How would I earn a living down the mountain? With your music. I couldn't take care of you right, doing this. Then work in a coal mine. No, I did that once, and I guarantee you, I never ever will again. So you're just content to sit on a mountain and hide your head in a jug, is that it? A man's meant to provide for his wife and his family, Lily. You were meant to make music. And besides which, I don't want you to take care of me. And I do have a plan. Well, of course you do. Did you ever have a day without a plan? It includes you, Tom. Do you want to hear it? Go on. Well, um, nowadays, phonographs, they only cost about $10. And I think that soon everyone is going to have one. I was thinking that we could make cylinders of mountain music and sell them. Who the hell would buy them? I think everyone would. I know they would, Tom. The way the music makes you feel, of course they would. Lily, you're just about as crazy as-- hey! What are you doing here? Go on, before I shoot you. I want to talk to deladis. Del, I come to get you to be my wife. I don't want no part of you. If you don't take me now, I'm marrying Polly. I went to the woods... And the knot didn't hold. You're Polly's now. I love you, child. Hey, del... We're going down the mountain. You want to come with us? We're going to make cylinders of mountain music to sell to outlanders. What? Isn't that the craziest thing you ever heard? It's the craziest. Of course she'll come with you. Granny? Tom, I'll be fine. I'll be right here when you come back to visit. Why don't you back up a ways till one of us can pull over? Perhaps I'd better get out. Are you Cyrus whittle? Yes, yes, I am. Who are you? I'm Lily penleric. Lily penleric? Well, how marvelous! I was just on my way to meet you. Didn't you get professor aldrich's letter? Yes, I did, but I didn't realize you were coming immediately. The work is urgent. Your discovery is too great. The collection must be moved forward as expeditiously as possible. That's why I'm here in hopes of being able to assist you. Assisting me? I told aldrich to ask your permission. I made myself quite clear to the Dean. I am only here to facilitate and cooperate in the completion of the collection of this vast body of songs. There is no collection beyond the 10 songs that I sent professor aldrich. What? All this time, you mean... Was destroyed in a fire. I can't bear it. I'm afraid so, along with my phonograph recordings. My lord! Phonograph, you say? I had no idea it was feasible to lug a phonograph into the wilderness. It isn't. Well, in that case, it is very fortuitous that I'm here, isn't it? We can start again, you and I. Thank you, professor whittle, but I'm afraid I have other plans. What on earth could be more important than this collection of songs? I bequeath the collection of the mountain ballads to you. To me? Well, how am I going to work without you? Well, when you get to bear creek, ask for Viney Butler. Tell Viney that Tom, Lily, and deladis said that you're a very nice man and she should help you. Who? Deladis? Deladis. Viney Butler. She knows dozens of songs. She will help you. Very well, professor, but I must assure you that I intend to publish these songs under both our names. Yours first, of course.
