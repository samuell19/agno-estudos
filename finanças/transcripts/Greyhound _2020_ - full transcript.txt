Twice in a single generation, the catastrophe of world war has fallen upon us. Twice in our lifetime has the long arm of fate reached out across the oceans to bring the United States into the forefront of the battle. Our American merchant ships must be free to carry our American goods into the harbors of our friends. And our American merchant ships must be protected by our American Navy. The brunt of the war has fallen upon the sailormen, and we have lost nearly 3,000 lives in a hard, unrelenting struggle, which goes on night and day and is going on now without a moment's respite. The goods will be delivered by this nation, whose navy believes in the tradition of "damn the torpedoes, full speed ahead." "Dear Lord, let your holy angel be with me, that the evil foe may have no power over me. Amen." Merry Christmas. Merry Christmas. Cigars? "Yesterday, today and forever." That's beautiful. I'll put it on my tree. All right. Your turn. Come on. All right. Monogrammed. What's this? Congratulations. Your first command. At last. Aw. After all those years of being fitted and retained, a Fletcher-class destroyer. You deserve it. I knew after Pearl Harbor they would be needing men like you. I report to Norfolk right after the first of the year. Norfolk? Not Treasure Island? That's the navy in a nutshell, isn't it? Yeah. Then the Caribbean for training and tactics. Jamaica, the Bahamas, Cuba. Rum and Coca-Cola. - Mm. - Then active duty. Come with me. I mean it. So I can ask you to marry me on a tropical beach. Oh, I'd like that, but we can't. The world has gone crazy, Ernie. Let's wait until we can be together. I will always be looking for you, Evie. No matter where I am. Even if I'm a thousand miles away, I will be hoping I'll see you come around the corner. Because when you do, it's... It's the greatest feeling in the world. - Morning. - Morning, Captain. Charlie, how are the overnights? Convoy's three days into the Pit. No contacts, no incidents, except on your ship, sir. Two bored sailors with time on their hands, which became fists. - Who? - Shannon and Flusser. - Crew's getting nervous, Ernie. - Sleep well, sir? I've never had the gift for sleeping on board. Hmm. And I can't sleep anywhere else, sir. - Amen. - Amen. Sea's a bit high to serve hot food. I could manage a ham steak and eggs for you, sir. - This will do. Thank you, Cleveland. - Aye, aye, Captain. Report to the commanding officer. Clear the room. Uncover. Explain yourselves. Flusser. I regret the incident, sir. Shannon. I too regret the incident. I will tolerate no more fisticuffs on my ship. So... "restore the relationships you have damaged and fill me with peace." Sir? Captain requested, bridge, sir. Captain requested, bridge. Repetition will bring hell down from on high. Back to your duties. Count your blessings. Captain on the bridge. Aye. Sir, good morning. Escorts Eagle and Harry are out of position, six miles from convoy. They've been off on their own, sir, for roughly two hours. Eagle skipper announced, "Starting the day with a good hunt," sir, and then Harry joined in. Message from the commodore, sir. Read it out. "Comconvoy to Comescort. H-U-F-F D-U-F-F"... "Huff Duff." High-frequency direction finding. Continue, please. "Huff Duff reports a German transmission bearing 087 degrees. Range 15 to 20 miles." Commodore says a likely U-boat, sir. "Comescort to Comconvoy. Will run it down." "Comescort to Comconvoy. Will run it down." Wait, wait. "Will run it down. Thank you." "Will run it down. Thank you."

Let's have our eyes on him. Aye, aye, sir. Target's disappeared, sir. Fell off the radar about six miles out. What's this, Charlie? Looks like he's dived, sir, by the way the pips faded out. He must've seen us, sir. Got his air and dove. Pips had him on course for us and the convoy, sir. Can you plot a search radius? I could, sir, but in ten minutes, the radius would be three square miles. Give me a course to intercept if the target maintains this course at six knots. Aye, aye, sir. Conn, Combat. Course to intercept is 096. Warn me two miles out from this intercept. Aye, aye, sir. Right handsomely, 096. Right handsomely to 096. Aye, aye, sir. Combat reports two miles from intercept, sir.

All hands, secure from general quarters. Escorts, Greyhound. We have sighted evidence of a kill. Congratulations, Captain. More food for the fish. The prize is yours, sir, but we'll need evidence of a kill for the Admiralty. Nothin' but the captain's trousers will do, I'm afraid. Just return to station. Congratulations, sir. Shall I steer a course for the debris to verify the kill? No, Mister Watson. Convoy is unguarded. Take us back to station. Aye, aye, sir. Helmsman, bring us back to station. Eppstine, is it? Eppstein, sir. Good work. Thank you. It's why I'm aboard, sir. Hey, Cap, pulled this corned beef and onion, sliced thick for you. Gotta eat, sir. Nah, take that to Lieutenant Cole. I bet he's worked up an appetite. Now, Mister Dawson. It's from the Admiralty, sir. They've intercepted multiple German transmissions. It's at least two hours old. "Enemy activity expected at Position Oboe." Congratulations, Captain. It's our first U-boat. Congratulations, sir. Fifty less krauts. Yes. Fifty souls. Sir, permission to secure boilers two and four?

It's a mechanical decoy about the size of an icebox, and it shoots out gas like an Alka-Seltzer. The krauts just drop it in the water, and it hangs there while we waste depth charges on it. Detail it in your after-action report. Make sure all the other operators are familiar with it. I... I should've caught it sooner, sir. No, you did good work. Thank you. Sir. Aye, sir.

We pulled everything from below last watch, if you recall, sir. Yes, yes, of course. Thank you, Mister Flipper. It's Fippler, sir. Mister Fippler, we must leave off the firing of full patterns. What I was gonna suggest, sir. "Wise as a serpent, harmless as a dove." - Captain. - I know it's risky, Charlie, but we need to break protocol. How soon can we reach air cover? No more zigzags, no evasive maneuvers. Aye, aye, sir. Go, Charlie. We can be in range of air cover in 24 hours. That's 0800 if we shift to a direct course, sir. Thanks, Charlie. What happened to him? Took a header. Gave me something more to do. - That for the captain? - Yeah. Man hasn't had a bite to eat or been off his feet since we left. General quarters, general quarters.

Man your posts. - Slow to one-third. - My language, sir. Slow to one-third. Aye, sir. - Dicky's in the line of fire! - Veer off, Dicky, veer off. Hold your fire. - Left full rudder. - Left full rudder. All mounts, local control, stand by broadside to port. - Fire as they bear. - Aye, sir. Come on, clear. Get clear, Dicky. Clear! Corpsman! Corpsman! - Dicky's clear! - All mounts, commence fire! Get some water in there! Dicky, Greyhound. What is your damage? Greyhound, our guns couldn't depress far enough to do any damage. But, at 20 yards, the shells went right through us without detonating. Are you seaworthy? All three hits were well above the waterline, sir. We'll have our holes patched, and we'll be back in the hunt. Very good. Return to your screening station at best speed. Direct hit on mount 43, sir. Damage Control reports fire, abaft frame 24. There's no flooding below the waterline, and the casualty count is coming, sir. Three severely wounded. Bonnor. Meyer. Forbrick is in critical shape. Three dead. Who are the dead? Pisani, gunner's mate, third class. Marx, seaman, second. Cleveland, messmate. Took a hit at the portside 40-millimeter gun tub, loading ammunition, sir. I've got no room for corpses down below, sir. Not with the four we pulled from Vasco. I can arrange for a service within the next ten minutes, sir. Of course. All hands. Aye, aye, Captain. Bill? How bad was he hit? Sir? George Cleveland. Completely mutilated, sir. All of them. "We therefore commit the earthly remains of Anthony Pisani, Daniel Marx, and George Cleveland to the deep, looking for the general Resurrection in their last day and the life of the world to come, through our Lord Jesus Christ, at whose second coming in glorious majesty to judge the world the sea shall give up her dead, and corruptible bodies of those who sleep in him shall be changed and made like unto his glorious body according to the m-mighty working whereby he is a-able to subdue all things unto himself. Amen." All stop. XO commands all stop. - All stop. - All stop, aye. Now, all hands, bury the dead. Now, all hands, bury the dead. Ship's company. Attention! Salute! Firing line, half right, face! Anthony Pisani, gunner's mate, third class. Ready. Fire! Daniel Marx, seaman, second. Ready. Fire! George Cleveland, messmate. Ready. Fire! Ready. Two! Distress rocket at rear of convoy! - Left standard rudder. - Left standard rudder. Aye, sir. Harry, Dicky. Greyhound. Eagle has been hit. I am going to his aid, rear of the convoy. Maintain your sweep. Go easy on your fuel. - Aye, sir. - Aye, aye, sir. - Messenger, my glasses. - Aye, sir. - Meet her. - Aye, sir. Heading up the lane. - Right standard rudder. - Right standard rudder. Aye, sir. - Meet her. - Meet her. - All ahead flank. - All ahead flank. Aye, sir. - Messenger. - Sir. - Mister Harbutt. - Sir. That's Eagle and Cadena. Circle them at one mile to cover the rescue. - Helm, left standard rudder. Come to 225. - Left standard rudder... Eagle, Greyhound. What is your status? We were hit forward of the engine room and have a fire below deck. Some casualties. The Kong Gustav was hit first, sank in three minutes. We saw no survivors. It's a bad afternoon, sir. How seaworthy are you? We have a five-degree list at starboard, and we're down at the stern, but we'll tow all right up to five knots. We have a flap of plate sticking up, scooping in the sea. The list gets worse if we make any speed. We must keep you afloat, Eagle. We'll do all the sea allows, sir. Very well. Greyhound out. I'm ready to relieve you, sir. Very well. We're steady on course 225. And we're at standard speed with fuel conservation. I relieve you, sir. Sir? Sir, I stand relieved. Mister Carling has the deck and the conn. Very well. Mister Carling, Cadena has Eagle under tow at four knots. Continue circling. We'll hold the screen at rear of convoy. Sonar, standard sweep to starboard. Sonar, Bridge. Search to starboard, standard pattern. Greyhound, Eagle. Greyhound, Eagle. Greyhound. Request permission to abandon ship, sir. The collision mats were not big enough. We have a 15-degree list now, and the main deck is underwater. Well, I'm sure you've done all you could. Permission granted. She's been a good home, sir. It's been an honor sailing with you. We'll be praying for you. Godspeed, Captain. Thank you for a job well done. Thank you, Cleveland. I'm Pitts, sir. - Thank you. - Sir. I need Mister Cole. XO requested, bridge. XO requested, bridge. You wanted to see me, skip? I've lost Eagle. Harry and Dicky are low on depth charges and fuel, as are we. I can offer only scant protection to the convoy. We need air cover, Charlie. Do... Do I break radio silence with a message to the Admiralty? Or does that let the wolf pack know just how vulnerable we are? What would the message be? "Help needed urgently." No. "Help needed." That means "urgently." "Needed" isn't needed. Just "help." That's all the Admiralty needs to hear for a modified rendezvous point. The Germans might miss a message as short as that. I wouldn't need to take this risk if I'd been smarter yesterday. What you did yesterday got us to today. It's not enough, Charlie. Not nearly enough. Message from the Admiralty, sir. Some of it's badly scrambled, sir. I've done my best with it. - XO to the bridge. - Aye, aye, sir. What are these scrambles? I think coded numerals, sir. But I'm sure of that. "Expect aircraft. His challenge, 'Uncle William.' Your answer, 'Baker Dog.'" Captain? Charlie. Message from Admiralty. Reinforcements dispatched. But it's only partially deciphered. Put together a team, see what else is there. Aye, aye, sir. Greyhound! Your flock is not safe from this wolf. We can always find you in the night to kill you. Escorts, Greyhound. - Or will Dicky die next? Or Harry? - Divert all further TBS traffic to channel Hotel. Execute. Thought these were numerals, but it was "Point X-ray." "Modify rendezvous point to Point X-ray." - Mm-hmm. How soon? - Something like four hours, skip. Sir. - Messenger. - Yes, sir. Go to my cabin and bring me my slippers. Aye, sir. Ah, thank you. Return those. Ah. I've got two contacts bearing 099... Combat reports two pips, starboard bow. Bearing 099. The other at 168, sir. - Boatswain, take us to white. - Aye, aye, sir. Charlie, these pips. Yes, sir, we got two skunks showing on surface radar. They're heading straight for us. Just two hours to the rendezvous point, Ernie, God willin'. All escorts, Greyhound. I have two surface targets off to starboard. Maintain your screens. Mister Watson, bring us up to general quarters. - General quarters. - Aye, aye, sir. General quarters, general quarters. All hands, man your battle stations. Harry, Dicky. Greyhound. I am engaging targets. Request permission to come down there and bounce 'em with you, sir. - Negative, Dicky. Maintain your screen. - Aye, sir. - Messenger. - Sir. I'd like more coffee, please. Aye, sir. Greyhound. Guten Morgen, Greyhound. Did you think you had slipped away from this Gray Wolf? No, you did not. You will not. The sea favors the Gray Wolf on the hunt, not the hound on the run. You and your comrades will die today. Conn, Combat. - Radar showing contact at 110. - Periscope to starboard bow. Range is 2,100 yards and closing, sir. About one mile! - There, sir! - Fire! The wake, sir! There! Contact 187... Sonar reports torpedoes, starboard beam, bearing 187. Range 1,500, sir. - Left full rudder. - Left full rudder. Second torpedo to starboard beam! Bearing 120! Range 1,000! - Right hard rudder, hard over! - Right hard rudder, hard over! Belay that, belay that! Meet her. Meet her! Belay. Meet her. Meet her. Aye, sir. Holding course. Right hard rudder, hard over! Starboard slow astern! Port ahead full! Starboard slow astern! Port ahead full! All hands, brace for collision! Meet her! Steer straight for that pip at 119! - 119. Aye, aye, sir. - All ahead full. - All ahead full. Aye, aye, sir. - We'll ram that U-boat if we have to! Torpedo off starboard bow! - Bring us full left to 100. - Aye, aye, sir. Conning tower, dead ahead! We must have hit her! Charlie! Lay a course to open the arcs of fire aft! We'll hit 'em broadside! Left full rudder, slow to two-thirds. After batteries, fire as you bear. All mounts, local control! Target will be fine on our starboard bow! Fire as they bear! Weapons, Bridge. All mounts, local control. Fire as they bear. Second sub spotted! Periscope, starboard bow! He's got us lined up, sir! All mounts, local control! Get those guns around! Air cover! Air cover! Signal Bridge reports aircraft signals. "Uncle William," sir. Reply, "Baker Dog." Right standard rudder! Mounts 41 and 42, open fire to mark the target for that aircraft! ...mark target for that aircraft. Good work. Sir, I stand relieved. Mister Carling has the deck. Very well. Messenger. - Yes, sir. - Write this. "To Comconvoy and all escorts: Sonar reports no contacts. Radar reports no contacts. All escorts, resume station." - Send it. - Aye, sir. My heading is 290, sir. - Very well. Steady as she goes. - Steady as she goes, sir. - All ahead standard. - All ahead standard. Aye, sir. Forward Lookout reports ship starboard bow. Bearing 110. Range eight miles. - Message, sir. - Read it out. "Admiralty to Greyhound. Welcome. Kindly make verbal report to Diamond on TBS." Diamond, Greyhound. Diamond, Greyhound. Do you hear me? Loud and clear, Greyhound. We hear you had a bit of a rough go of it. Yes, sir. In the last 48 hours, we've lost seven ships from the convoy. Two others were damaged. And the condition of your command? How are you holding up? I took a round from a sub on our portside deck. Three were killed. But you are seaworthy? Yes, sir. Dicky and I fought him out on the surface, and we got him. Uh, my escort group sank three others. Four U-boats? Bloody good job, Greyhound. We will be relieving you now and taking the convoy on to Liverpool. You take Dicky and Harry and make best speed to the naval yard in Londonderry. Sir, I request I stay with the convoy. I have 56 hours fuel at economical speed. No, that's an order, Commander. We'll see the convoy on from here. I need you to take Dicky and Harry back home. They're not fit to stay in the game, understood? Off to Derry with you. Aye, aye, sir. Tell me, Greyhound, just curious, how many crossings does that make for you now? This was my first, sir. Unbelievable. Well, let's hope next time's a bit easier, eh? Admirable show, Commander. Thank you, sir. Dicky, Harry. Greyhound. - Dicky here. - Harry here. You are relieved of your screening duties. Form starboard echelon on me at the head of the convoy. We will depart on 087 for Londonderry. Aye, aye, sir. Aye, sir. Messenger. - Messenger. - Sir. - Signal Bridge. Send it. - Signal Bridge. Aye, sir. Commodore is signaling five minutes to course change, Captain. Very well. Take us up the lane. When we clear the lead ships, turn right to 087. - Dodge, James, starboard echelon. - Aye, aye, sir. Steady on 087. Starboard echelon. - Helm, mark your head. - Mark 083, sir. Very well. Keep her so. Steady as I go. Aye, sir. Mister Carling, she's all yours. I will be in my cabin if you need me. Aye, aye, sir. "I thank you, my heavenly Father, that you have graciously kept me this day. Into your hands I commend myself, my body and soul. Amen."
