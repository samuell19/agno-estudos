♪ ♪ Good morning, teacher. Oh, I'm not a teacher. Oh, and I'm not a duck. I'm the worst cat in seven states. Look, my car is over there. I... I stalled it. I must've dampened the motor when I hit a puddle. Would you mind giving me a push? That wouldn't be safe on a stormy night like this. Look... Look, er... If I can't get a push, would you mind giving me a lift? Sure. The heat feels good. And your car, it... was pointing in the other direction. Too bad, isn't it? Excuse me, but... If your car was heading down, it seems odd that you would take a lift from a stranger heading up. Am I supposed to mind which way I'm going, up or down? Were you lost or something? Aren't we all? What was that? A tree fell down behind us. Phew. Was a close one. Now we can't turn back if we wanted to. Oh, they'll clear the tree off the road pretty soon. Why does that frighten you? A tree down behind us, and... Ten miles ahead, this road dwindles off and ends. It's like a door closing behind you. And you have to go on all the way. The tree missed us. Everything misses you if you're moving fast enough. You don't mind moving fast? I always have. It saves time. I guess so. 'Course, there's other things people can use more than time. -What? -Money. You can't do much without money, no matter how much time you have. You can't do anything without time. You sound like a guy heading for the electric chair. Aren't we? You tryin' to give me the creeps? I'm sorry. State prison's around here somewhere. I was just trying to make a joke. Well, it touched close to home. Where is the prison? Back, past that tree that fell. You tryin' to find the prison? No. The warden's house. The warden's house is up ahead, about a mile past Cady's Lodge. Why are you going to the warden's house? On a Friday night? For no reason that I know of. You believe that? Look, I'd like to stick around and find out that reason, Sam, but, uh... There're lights up ahead, I... Yeah, it's Cady's Lodge. I'll get out there. [THUNDER CLAPPING] You'll find the warden's estate about a mile up the road. It's the only thing up there. You can't miss it. I hope I'll be bumming you for a cigarette. Mine got slightly wet. You know, a while ago, you thought it was strange, a girl heading down the road, accepting a ride from a stranger heading back up. Yeah. Yeah, I did. But there's always a reason for everything. You see, I'm staying here at Cady's Lodge. So you brought me home, you see. It all make sense. Yeah, sure. Except you. Me? Going to the warden's house. Not knowing why. On a Friday night. At eight o'clock. Four hours before they hang Frankie Pierce. So long, stranger. [THUNDER CLAPPING] Well? I didn't expect you back so soon. My car stalled. You didn't get too wet. Walk far? -A man gave me a lift. -Where'd he go? Well, how should I know? He was in a hurry. Get me a double scotch on the rocks, will you? Enjoyed the beer, Cady. I can always depend on you, Sheriff. Rain or shine, one glass of beer. No, cheer up. You can always make a living off the specs. [CHUCKLING] -Sure quiet up here. -You're the only one staying here. No one stays here in the winter. -I mean, it's quiet for a... -I know what you mean. Quiet for a Friday night. Quiet for an execution night. Incidentally, the name you signed on the register... Ellie Pierce. That's not your real name, is it? That's the name I put down, buster. Take it or leave it. But you can't be his wife, or his sister, or even a cousin. You don't act like a relative. Well, can I help it if my name happens to be Ellie Pierce? It's a funny coincidence. Frankie Pierce is the one they're hanging tonight. Yeah, it's a funny coincidence. Let's just have a good laugh, hmm? You know... Sometimes, I can't figure the ones who come here on such Friday nights. Take the man who gave you the lift. Why is he heading north? There's nothing there but the warden's place. Maybe he wants to see the warden. SAM: Is it open up there? I don't see any lights past the gate. Mister, that's the warden's house. Warden of the state prison. Now who're you? I'm Sam Morgan. I wanna see him. Well, I'm Sheriff Mitchell, and I can tell you right now, you won't be able to see him. Not on Friday night. Well, I tried to phone him. Well, I'll tell you again, you won't be able to see him. 'Cause he's already left for the prison. Well, there's a tree down across the road below. He couldn't get to the prison. Well, in that case, he'll probably stop at Cady's lodge and phone a hand and have it cleared away. He's gotta get to the prison tonight! -Cady's lodge? -Yeah, back up and follow me, I'll show you. ♪ ♪ You've got the weirdest set of records on that jukebox. I don't get much call for that cheery stuff up here. You've come a long way to get to this neck of the woods. A long ways. Just for laughs? Some gag. You don't act like a spec. [DOOR OPENING] CADY: Hello, warden. Can you call the highway patrol for me, please? CADY: Certainly. Wet night out. Real wet. Yeah. -Good evening, warden. -Hello, Mitch. This is Sam Morgan. He wants to talk to you. The phone is dead, Warden. Warden... I'm sorry, Mr. Morgan. I have no time. No time at all. I've got to get back to my office at the prison. I'll get out where the tree's over the road, and I'll have to walk the rest of the way. That's right, you've got to be there tonight. Tonight, I do. -Any chance of a reprieve? -No, no, none at all. But Pierce might tell me something. Something vitally important. SAM: Warden? SAM: Then, uh... I don't suppose there's a chance for a stay of execution. You have a reason? Well, uh... Not exactly. Well, if you had one, you should've called the district attorney or Pierce's lawyer, or the governor. I'm just a servant of the state. Yeah... That's a good excuse. That was an unkind thing to say. I didn't mean to be unkind, sir... I meant nothing at all, I... I guess I have nothing more to say. Then what did you want to see me about, Mr. Morgan? Well, sir, my... My reason sounds pretty weak but... You mean to tell me, you drove all the way up here in this storm? Yes, sir. Well, who are you? I'm a grocer, and I have a... It's an odd hour. But I have a feeling that... That Pierce isn't guilty. No, sir. He's guilty, all right. Maybe. Maybe? What is it, Mr. Morgan? You're Sam Morgan! Now I understand, of course. Yes, sir, I'm Sam Morgan. I remember now, you're the one that gave the testimony. WARDEN: What is it, Sam? I don't know exactly how to say it. Maybe I can say it for you. You're a man with a conscience. There aren't many left. SHERIFF: Your testimony closed the door on Frankie Pierce, and closed it permanently. That's what that paper said! WARDEN: No doubts left, Sam? No, sir... I, I, I... I told them what I saw. On the stand, I said, "I thought the man I saw running from the robbery, "looked like Frankie Pierce." SAM: And that's all I could say! And that's all I said. I said, "Yes, sir. I thought the man I saw running away, "looked like Frankie Pierce, but I'm not sure." WARDEN: And you told the truth. SHERIFF: Uh, excuse me, warden. If you're going to walk far in this storm, we better get started. WARDEN: One moment, please. You still feel the same, Sam? Yes... I still think he looked like Frankie Pierce. But I've never been sure. Well, sure or not, you've closed the door on Frankie and closed it tight. The lawyers, they took my words, and... They twisted them all around! I, I, uh... They seemed to think my opinion was better than it was. All my life, nobody ever believed what I said, but until this trial. Then they said, well, "This is an honest and reliable businessman, this Sam Morgan. "His opinion is good and valid." Then, you're not reliable and honest. I am, sir. But... No more than anybody else. I just said that I thought the man escaping, looked like Frankie Pierce. Then exactly what do you want to see me about, Sam? Just that I'm not sure. I've never been sure. I never said I was sure. SAM: The lawyers took my words, and twisted them all around. They took my opinion like I was a... A big shot, or something. You're a man with a conscience. Warden... Will you see him... -before they do it to him? -I will. Would you... Yes, Sam? Would you tell him something from me? Would you tell him that I'm sorry? Well, there was a lot of testimony. WARDEN: I don't think he'll even remember who you are. Just let him remember that... Somebody's sorry. Good night, Sam Morgan. SAM: Good night, sir. Looks to me like you've just got a clear case of witness-itis. But it's not unusual for witnesses to feel like this on... SHERIFF: execution night. Mind if I give you a little advice? Don't stay around here. Why? The owner here's a fanatic about his clock. We all set our watches according to Cady's clock. SHERIFF: He keeps it exact. Exact. Well, I can't very well get out with a tree down on a road. You wanna know exactly when Frankie Pierce gets it? Cady's clock will tell ya. You wanna know? Yes. And I wanna know why. You'll find out. So you came all the way up from the city? When are you go back? I don't know... With a tree down on the road, looks like there won't be anymore specs tonight. Specs? Spectators. Speculators. The ones that come here on Friday nights and stay until twelve. Twelve, they drop the trap over at the death house. And my customers get up and leave. [CLOCK CHIMING] Don't be alarmed. It only strikes 11 times. This time. Well, it looks like there won't be anymore customers tonight. I guess Frankie Pierce just didn't have enough relatives or friends to come. Don't be startled. That was for 11:30. On the house. "Morgan testimony clinches Pierce case." Well, you're a new one. Usually, it's friends or relatives, or even enemies that come up here on Friday nights. Sometimes, even a cop hoping to learn something from the condemned, so he can come up with another condemned, later on. But you're the first witness. Can you beat it? He's not even related to the guy. Just the witness that set him up. What are you here for? A couple of quiet drinks. You wouldn't have much longer to wait. Sam, what really is your reason for coming up here? Is it that you think he's not guilty? They judged him guilty! The only thing I'm not sure of is my identification of him. I was never sure. I never said I was sure. Then what are you here for, Morgan? Did you come here to see the warden change your testimony? What if they hanged an innocent one tonight? And what if we knew it? Cady, will you give us a moment's peace? I'd guess you were Pierce's wife. If you weren't taking it this way. Will you please go? Are you Mrs. Frankie Pierce? Do I look like the grieving wife? No. Do I look like anybody's wife? Well... I guess not. Well, I am. I am his wife. For another 26 minutes. I guess there's nothing we or anyone can do now. Why... Why do they do it this way? You know why they do it this way? Can it do any good? They say it makes a man think twice. Yet, in the last war, ten million died. Who thought twice? Who cares? Who does care? Sam... Do you wanna wait outside? -Ellie! -Oh, Sam, stop it! You can't stop it. Telephone! CADY: The wires are down. I did it. I did it. I, Paulo Martinez... I killed the policeman. Frankie Pierce is innocent! MARTINEZ: He is innocent. MARTINEZ: I did it. I, Paulo Martinez. MARTINEZ: It was I who did it. Frankie Pierce is innocent. I did it. I, Paulo Martinez. I tried... to call the warden. I tried everything. I get no reply. I try. MARTINEZ: Oh, I try. Madre de Dios mio, kill me. I did it. That dying man is innocent. [CLOCK CHIMES] Nine. Ten. CADY: 11. CADY: 12. MARTINEZ: Oh, D ios mio! Did you put the tree down across the road before me. Why? Why, Dios mio, why? Morning, Cady. Ah, I guess the rain's over. It's cleared up. -Mrs. Pierce in? -No, sheriff. Well, I better leave this here for her then. This is the last of Frankie Pierce, even includes his clothes. They're getting him all laid out up there in a new suit furnished by the state. Yeah, that's the least the state could do. Too bad Martinez didn't get there on time. Well, he tried, I'll say that for him. Uh, got him locked up in a cell down there now, he's takin' it real hard. Sam Morgan's taking it real hard, too. -He's still here? -Yes, he took a room last night. He's been drinking quite a bit. Oh, that figures, I guess. Man with a conscience. I don't blame Morgan. Terrible thing that happened. Yeah. One in a million. Why didn't Martinez call the prison? Oh, he'd had plenty of time to get to the warden's house, if it hadn't been for the tree across the road. Like I said, he tried, and you've gotta give him credit for it. Could he have confessed to save Frankie Pierce? No, not a chance. Could he be a crank? No, I wish he was. But he proved that he did it. Pierce died innocent. Put another drink for my bill, Cady. CADY: Help yourself, Morgan. Morning, Sam. Where to? To the bar, sheriff. To the bar. And, after that? Home. SHERIFF: Home? Home to what? Oh, nothin'. I heard you had a grocery store. Did you? Mm-hmm. Sam, now cut it out. There's no sense in you taking it so hard. Mistakes will be made, as long as there's men on earth here to make 'em. So... We're all human. How's Mrs. Pierce taking it? SAM: How do you think she's taken it? Sam... What do you know about Mrs. Pierce? Nothing, why should I? You're gonna burn your fingers. She came all the way up from Jordan to Mexico. That's a lot of miles. And yet, she doesn't seem to be taking it as hard as you are. How do you think she feels, learning he was innocent, hmm? Sam, I'm gonna tell you something for your own good. Frankie Pierce was no angel. He's given the police nothing but trouble for the last 15 years. That's the reason they executes him. SHERIFF: No, but he'd have made the rope sooner or later, anyhow. SHERIFF: You sent him in that direction. Without any help? Sam, Frankie Pierce was a known criminal. And there's one thing I can't forgive him for. Two years ago, he took the bank for $160,000. Yeah, yeah, I know. You know. We all know. I'm only telling you this to ease your conscience. The warden went to him five minutes before execution time, and he said, "Frankie, there's nothing that can save you now. SHERIFF: "So why don't you tell us where the money is hidden? "It's the least you can do, and it might wipe some of those black marks "off your soul, before we hang you." SHERIFF: You think he'd do it? SHERIFF: No. SHERIFF: Frankie Pierce had to stay just what he was right up to the end, a mean, vicious, contemptible criminal! Here he was, a man about to die... But still, he'd let that money rot someplace, just for sheer meanness and spite! So you see, he deserved... To be killed for a crime he didn't commit. SHERIFF: I didn't say that. But that money belonged to the bank. And I could never forgive Frankie Pierce for dying and not telling us where it was hidden. That's the kind of a rat he was. So stop blaming yourself. You did the state a service, believe me. -Good morning, Mrs. Pierce. -Good morning, Sheriff. I just now brought the things you requested. Uh, Cady? Mrs. Pierce's suitcase? CADY: Here it is, sheriff. Thank you. You said you were going for a walk. I thought I'd bring it up to you when you came in. I thought you had checked out. You look like you've been walking with four knights with your conscience. Ah, Ellie, I want to talk to you. Later, Sam. I'm in kind of a hurry now, huh? Well, what happened? A cyclone hit? Oh, I get it. Frankie Pierce's stuff. Yes, and I'm Mrs. Pierce, remember? I've got a right to go through his things. You're only looking for the money, too. What do you mean, "too?" Who else is looking for it? I was talking to the sheriff. That's all he talked about. -The money. -What's wrong with money? SAM: Nothing. Did the, um... Sheriff say anything else? Nope. I suppose you wanna help look too... for a cut. No, if you don't mind, I'll just watch. No, I don't want to look for it. You might as well let me watch. From now on, any sort of a secret's safe with me. Yep. The law and Sam Morgan'll never be on speaking terms again. The trouble with you, Sam, is the minute you stuck your nose outta that grocery store and into the world, you got it clobbered. Will you rip these up for me? The world wasn't ready for your kind of conscience, and you weren't ready for it. He must've left some kind of a clue. It'll take the scissors to open the seams on this one. [SIGHING] Cigarette? No, not one of his! When a man has so much money hidden, and not leave a clue as to where it is! Is that the only reason you came up here Friday night? For the money? If that bothers you, you can walk outta here right now. Don't look at me like that. Just because they hanged the man who didn't deserve hanging, and it... It hit you like a dish of cold spaghetti. Don't expect me to fall apart because of it. Get this straight, Sam. I'm the lovely lady from Play Girl's Paradise. It's a two-bit chip joint right down on Delgado Street, just off Skip Road. What's so funny? You're going into this big line, that's what's so funny. SAM: Say, uh... What if I tell you where the money is? Cut it out, Sam. Well, I have to put through a phone call. I'd better be from my room. You comin'? ELLIE: Sam, you mean it? We'll split fifty-fifty, Ellie. ELLIE: Man, you catch on fast. Okay. Let's go. Well, this brand of cigarettes, these Carnivals, were discontinued two years ago. The factory stopped making 'em. I used to sell 'em in my store. Two years ago. And that was when Frankie Pierce robbed that bank. So what? Well... Between the wrappings here... I found this key. Well, it could've dropped in there, like a coin or something. It had to be put there before this brand was discontinued. -Then it was hidden there. -Yes. Two years ago, when Frankie Pierce got away with $160,000. It's a post office box key. Sam, there must be a million post of... office boxes. How about the one in Jordan, New Mexico? Cady? Get me outside, the operator. Operator? I want to put a long-distance call through. To the post office in Jordan, New Mexico. Shakin' like a leaf. Hello? Uh, I'd like some information about my post office box there, please. Yes, I have a key right here, it's number 311. Um... Uh, there was a package to be sent to me there... Would you mind looking in 311 and see if it's there? Somehow, I've got him make him tell me the name of that box holder. Yes? Yes, uh, it's there? Yes, I know it's been there a long time, that's why I wanted to ask you about... Would you check and see if my box rental has been paid up? My secretary may have forgotten. Yes, number 311. [WHISPERING] It's a package. It's been there a long time. But how are we going to find out the name he used? I gotta make him say it. It's the only way. If he doesn't come back to the phone and say, "Yes, Mr. Jones," "No, Mr. Smith," or... Yes? Yes, of course this is Frederick Freebuger. I see. Then she must've paid the box rental. Can you forward the package to me? Yes, uh, I will pay the forwarding postage. Air mail, special delivery. It should be here in about two days? Three at the most. Yes. To Frederick Freebuger. Care of Sam Morgan. Cady's lodge. Route Two. Well, I'll be closing up shop. It's early. Just eleven. There won't be any more customers tonight, not this time of the winter. What about us? Help yourselves. Just put it on the bill, I trust you. Oh, and if the sheriff comes in for his one glass of beer, would you mind giving it to him? Sure. Sam, are you gon... Are you sure you're not gonna wanna get out of this at the last minute? I mean, forget you even heard about the money? No, I won't wanna get out. This is as close as I'll ever be to that much money. -Come on, let's get the suitcase. -No, wait. We don't dare bring it down yet. Not until we're sure the sheriff won't come in. You know, uh... We talked too much about me. Never about you. You told me quite a little bit about you this afternoon when you hit the ceiling. I'd like to hear more about this, uh... Delgado Street Playhouse, or whatever it was. You know, there's also a Delgado Street in New York. What do you mean, also? I thought you were from Jordan, New Mexico. Oh, well, uh... Delgado Street is, uh... There is a Delgado Street in Jordan. It's a Mexican word, and... I didn't know there was one in New York, too. Although, I've been to New York. Sam, uh... How'd you lose your store? Just went broke. Lost my capital. Was only $1,800, but it cost me the store. How can you lose your store on a crummy 1,800 bucks? Forget it. I just went broke. Businesses go broke. Not after 20 years. Come on over and sit down, and tell me all about how you lost your capital. Well... When they started twisting my words at the trial, I gave your husband's lawyer my money... To help him. But, it didn't help. And, first thing I knew, all the bills came due at once, and I lost the store. After 20 years. This must sound pretty dumb to you. Oh, no, Sam. No, it doesn't sound dumb. Now, we're going to have money. A ton of it. And all we have to do is sit here and wait for them to deliver it smack into our laps. Air mail, special delivery. Now would you like to tell me more about you? I will tell you that once upon a time, I thought I was doing all right alone. Until now. I never knew what it was to trust a man, or to share with anybody. Or to have someone with you. With you all the way. What're you trying to tell me? That I like you, Sam. Very much. You look tired. You wanna take a nap? I'll watch for the sheriff. No, I don't think he'll be by for his beer tonight, anyway. Look, we'd better get the suitcase down here, before that fire gags up. All right. Don't make any noise to wake Cady. I'll lock the main door. Oh, I'd like a room, please. Oh, Mr. Cady's retired for the night. Oh? Well, how do I call him? Well, uh... I don't think we ought to disturb him. I'll take care of it for you. I'll show you to your room, Mrs... Mrs. Frank Pierce, Georgia... Is anything wrong? -Mrs. Frank Pierce? -Yes? Are you all right? MRS. PIERCE: Oh, excuse me, but I thought I saw your hand shaking. I know who you are! Your picture in the paper... You're the man who testified against him. Yes. Oh. I feel I was sorry for you. It seems to be troubling you. You can come out now, "Mrs. Pierce." Do you have to keep calling me Mrs. Pierce? Maybe I shouldn't. I wanna get Cady away from the desk. This ought to do it. Stand near the window, and watch for the mailman. But Sam, he's not bringing the package until tomorrow! Or maybe even the day after. Just watch for him. Let me know when he's coming. I wanna go down and let him know I'm a friend of Frederick Freebuger's. -Sam? -Yeah? What about after we leave here? We'll have to lay low until we're sure it's blown over. ELLIE: What about my name? You'll leave it like it is, of course. And when Cady realizes I'm the wrong Mrs. Pierce, or... Or the sheriff realizes it? SAM: Well, I'm afraid of Cady. You wanna know whom I'm afraid of? -Who? -Mrs. Frankie Pierce. Yeah. Say... Invite her to dinner tonight. Tell her the food here is no good. We'll take her into town for dinner. [CAR HONKING] Here come's the postman. Now, look. Call Cady. Get him up here to fix that pipe I loosened. Keep him up here for two or three minutes. Okay. I'm Sam Morgan. -Oh, sorry. Nothing for you. -Well, I'm expecting a package but, not for a day or two. Well, there's nothing yet. It'll be sent for my friend, Frederick Freebuger, but sent care of me. Well, uh... It'll be along. Do you usually get here about the same time each day? Yeah. Unless it's raining, of course. Well, I just thought maybe I'd plan to be here to sign for it, and pay the postage due. You see, it's being forwarded on, and there'll be postage due. Oh, well, the hotel can pay for it, and collect it from you. Well, in any event, I just thought I'd plan to be here if you get around here about the same time each today. Yeah. Unless it's stormy. It's a little late for dinner, but I guess it was worth waiting for. -Would you like some more coffee? -No, thank you. Well, it was certainly nice of you two to invite me for dinner. Well, Sam thought with the three of us staying at the lodge, maybe we ought to stick together. You came quite a distance, Mrs. Pierce. Now I'd have thought they could've sent you his things. That's why you came, of course. To get his things. No. I thought, maybe you came to pick up his clothes and luggage, and all. No. Okay, you came because of me. Well, why do you say that? Well, there's no reason the cards can't lay face up on the table. Well, what do you mean? Well, surely, Cady's told you I've been staying at the lodge a week telling everybody I was Frankie Pierce's wife. Mr. Cady is a strange man. Why? Because he didn't tell me any such thing. Maybe you're a strange woman, too. You know, I knew Frankie. Used to come into a joint where I worked in New York. We got friendly. So why am I here? I just dropped in to say goodbye to my friend, Frankie Pierce, before they hanged him. Only, they wouldn't let me in. So I told them that I was his wife. So I'd make them let me in to say goodbye. It's as simple as that. What isn't so simple is you taking it so calm. Aren't you jealous, or anything? No. And you didn't come up here to get his things? No. Sure. There can be only be one reason why she came this distance. For his funeral tomorrow. Of course. Of course! Look, I'm sorry. There's nothing to be sorry for. Well, that is why you came up here, though. The funeral. No. Shall we go? Check, please. You folks going to be staying here much longer? No. Gonna be here next Friday? Cady, isn't it about time you got lost? Yeah, you usually go to bed early. Yes. I think I will, it's late. Nice of you to check in Mrs. Pierce last night, Morgan. So what? So business seems to be picking up around here. I checked in another guest tonight while you were out to dinner. Another Mrs. Pierce? No, a detective from the city. Turn down the lights when you're through, and whatever you drink, just put it on your bills. Sam, I'm scared if he is a detective... Frederic Freebuger, New York City. Sam, now we've got to get out of here. We've got to get out of here fast! SAM: Ellie! Look, you never even cared about the money until after what they did to Frankie Pierce! We don't even need it now! You're getting panicky. Get a hold of yourself! I'm shaking like a leaf! Listen to me. When that package gets here, it will be put in Freebuger's mailbox. It's addressed to him. Care of me, but to him. What do we do? The postman knows me. All I have to do, is get to him before... Before he gets it to Cady, 'cause Cady would just hand it over to Freebuger. And who is the detective? Why doesn't he show himself? And why is he here? I wish you had the shakes I've got. I wish you'd get out of here with me! Ellie! I can't get out. They changed me. They changed me good. [ELLIE SIGHS] Sam, give me a cigarette. You know something? -I don't think there is a detective here. -What do you mean? It can all be explained if the man in 219 isn't a detective. -Man in 219? -Freebuger. If he is a cop... That means, he knows that Frankie used the name of Freebuger to hide the money. Well, then, who is Freebuger? I think we'll find that he's a former friend of Frankie's. A New York hood, maybe. Somebody who's after the money. Somebody who knew that Frankie used the name Freebuger. And who couldn't get into the post office box down in Jordan simply because he didn't have the key! They could've phoned him like you did. Now, who would think of it? And who would realize that they would forward a package like that? Well, you thought of asking. Just a shot in the dark. Maybe the man in 219 phoned, and they told him they were already forwarding it to him. Maybe. Why doesn't he show himself? I dunno. That's the part I don't like. [THUNDER RUMBLING] -Hi, Cady. -CADY: Hi, Sheriff. Rain or shine, one glass of beer, regularly as clockwork, eh, Sheriff? Yeah. -Sam, the sheriff usually comes by at night! -Take it easy. Maybe he just dropped by to get out of the rain. I still wanna get out of here in on piece. Not until that package comes. Sam, he's taking off his slicker. He's finished his beer, but he's staying! What if he's waiting for the postman, too? Get a hold of yourself. That money's coming here. Until it gets here, we can't get out. I better have another. SAM: Another one? Sure, why not? I heard Cady say that you have one beer only, rain or shine. Well, that's usually the case, but, uh... I just thought, maybe, Mrs. Pierce and I can talk a little better over a drink. -Talk? Me? -That's what I'm here for. I don't understand, sheriff. You and me, talk? Well, now, don't tell me I drove all the way out here in the rain and broke a habit, and had two beers, and no talk. What do you mean? Well, I have a three o'clock appointment with Mrs. Pierce. What appointment? Don't tell me you didn't call and ask me to meet you here! Sheriff, I have the least idea what you're talking about. Well, how do you like that? Woman called, and said, "This is Mrs. Frankie Pierce. "Meet me at Cady's lodge at three o'clock. It's urgent." SHERIFF: Here I am. Maybe it was the other Mrs. Pierce, Sheriff. The other Mrs. Frankie Pierce? CADY: That's right, sheriff. I guess. But it's only 2:30 now. Maybe you'd better wait until three. Ah, there goes the postman. Guess there's nothing for us today. -You two, uh, care to join me in a drink? -No, thanks, Sheriff. Here's something I can't figure out, Cady. -Sam Morgan? -And Mrs. Frankie Pierce! It's going to get harder to figure. You just sit tight, let 'em grab their best hole, and see what they do about it. Sam, can we talk in your room? What's wrong with yours? Now what? All ready to get out? A day early? Why? Cady asked me to change rooms. Well, that doesn't sound right. -But he did! -Why? Cady had a very good reason for asking me to change rooms, Sam. He has to call a new plumber to repair the pipes that you wrecked yesterday. Funny what $160,000 can do to a man. Ellie... I'm sorry. Sam, did you think I'd want it all? Sam, there's uh... Something I want you to do for me. What? Go down to Mrs. Pierce's room and find out why she wanted to see the sheriff. Please, I want you to. -Can't stop being afraid, can you? -Sam, please go see her! Sure. And... Sam, while you're there, tell her, uh... Tell her not to get me into anymore trouble? Tell her, that's all I've known since I was a kid, huh? Now, what else do you think I might ask her? Well, uh... A girl that I'm in love with, uh... She has her false ideas. But, like a lot of other people... She was interested in the money your husband took from that bank. My goodness, Mr. Morgan. I'm afraid I would have to forgive anyone for almost anything if all that money was their goal. -Well, you have an appointment with Sheriff Mitchell. -Yes. I'd like to ask you a favor. Please don't get my girl into trouble. I'll level with you. She used your name, posed as Mrs. Frankie Pierce, to try to find out where he hid that money. To try and get it. Now, when we got hold of his things... This is all the money we found on him. All of it. You're a kind man. No, here, take it. It's rightfully yours. Please, Mr. Morgan. Don't give me your money. It isn't necessary. But it... My girl and I... We tried to find out where he hid the money. You're a very kind man, trying to help me. -Is that what you really think? -Yes. And I won't get your girl in trouble. Now I have that appointment with the sheriff. SAM: Excuse me. -Where's Ellie? -Gone. What do you mean, gone? Checked out. She was afraid. She didn't look afraid, she just checked out. Didn't she give you that package? -What package? -A package came for you. But you said the postman had passed. Oh, I was wrong, it was a car that looked like his. No, he brought the package. She was here when it came. Said she'd seen the postman through the window. Paid the postage due... And she said she'd take it up to you. Came down a minute later, and checked out. -The package. -Sure. What's wrong? SHERIFF: Sam? Could you come over here a minute? I want you to hear this. Sit down. Mr. Morgan. As I told you, I did not come up here to get my husband's things or for the funeral. I had to find out for sure whether Martinez was telling the truth when he confessed. And, the sheriff has convinced me beyond any doubt that Martinez was guilty. And, accordingly, that your husband was innocent. What's changed? Well, after Frank hid the money... He was afraid to have any money. Afraid even to earn it. Or, to spend it... Any money, whatever... For fear that the police would be sure that he robbed the bank. You see, his plan was to stay broke. Penniless. I mean, even hungry, just anything to play this part of a poor man. So he and Mrs. Pierce moved in with his father. Oh, my. He and my father quarreled all the time. Frank hated my father. One night, he threatened to kill him. MRS. PIERCE: And then, the very next morning, he seemed to be trying to patch it up by offering to go on a deer-hunting trip with my father. Now, you listen to this, Sam. You listen. Well, they left for that trip. And, uh... Several days later, we found my father's body. He'd been shot... It was a bullet from Frank's rifle. You mean, uh... It was no accident. He was murdered. Frank murdered my father. The police proved it. They had the motive and everything, until... Well, the whole case just suddenly collapsed. Because, Frankie Pierce was picked up in New York and jailed for murder. Tried and convicted. So this is not a case of an innocent man being executed. Well, I've got to get up and tell the warden. How do you feel now, Sam? Right back where I started. Yeah, we were wrong, but only in a technicality. Where there's smoke, there's fire. I've gotta hurry along here, gotta drive slow in the storm. Mr. Morgan? You seemed so worried and afraid last night at dinner. But there's nothing to be afraid of now, is there? No. Mr. Morgan. I heard the good news. You have sharp ears, Cady. I suppose you'll be leaving us soon. -You sound anxious. -Not at all. You didn't answer my question. Get my bill ready. [CLOCK CHIMES] I know it's only six o'clock, but it's dark out already. I don't mean to bother you so often, it's just that I'm expecting a package. I wanna know if the postman is likely to knock off early and finish tomorrow. Good. I thought a rural carrier might want to get in out of the rain. Thank you. CADY: Well. Took you quite a while. Are you in a hurry for me to leave, Cady? CADY: It's just that check out time is four o'clock. I should charge you for an extra day, but I think we'll overlook it this time. $18 for rent. $22 for beverages. I'm about $10 short. Why don't you write out a check? Ah, you see, when I decided to come here, I drew out all my money. "Paid in full." Let's just call it square, eh? There's your receipt, paid in full. -Fair enough? -Thanks. Cady... Uh, when Ellie left, did she say anything? Just checked out. -She left no message? -No message. Goodbye, Morgan. Can you breathe through that gag? I can remove it now, your boyfriend's gone. Too bad you two didn't scare away. -Where is he? -He's gone, checked out. CADY: I'll see you later, when the money comes. Why don't you kill me now? If it doesn't come, or if it isn't that package, I might wanna persuade you to tell me what went wrong. -And if it comes? -If it comes, your troubles will be over. CADY: Yes? I, uh, forgot something in my room. -You better hurry. -Why? Stormy again. You're liable to find another tree down across the road behind you. I happened to notice what you wrote on my bill. -Paid in full, Morgan. -Yeah. But it's in the same handwriting Freebuger used when he registered. Well, you see, I had to check him in. There was a big fire, and the poor guy burned both his hands. That's why he hasn't been down for his meals or drinks. I hope you'll find what you left in 216. Mr. Morgan! I see you've changed rooms. No, it's Mr. Freebuger's room. [THUNDER RUMBLING] -No such man. -Well, how do you account for it? I made a phone call once. Cady must've listened then. Mr. Morgan, what's wrong? Can I help you? I'm beginning to think maybe I haven't lost my girl! Ellie! Ellie! [TAPPING ON DOOR] All my customers checked out, and I thought I'd close shop early. Unless you were coming down for your one glass of beer. You can't? Too many this afternoon, eh, Sheriff? That ought to teach you to stick to just one glass of beer. One glass of beer, rain or shine. Mr. Cady, what's wrong? That gun! This is your room, Mrs. Pierce. In here. Ellie! Ellie! Sam, in here! Sam, Cady knew the money was coming. He's been trying to frighten us away! -Yeah! -CADY: Yes. It would've been better had I succeeded. Now I'll have to kill you before the postman gets here. [GASPING] SAM: He's a hunter. He must have other guns! SAM: The bar! It's been laying out in the mud in the rain. Do you suppose it'll fire? [GUN CLICKING] [GUN CLICKING] SAM: It works now. There's a car pulling up outside. ELLIE: It's the postman! Get over behind the desk. Go on! SAM: Get behind the desk, Cady. SAM: And don't show any sign that anything's wrong here. POSTMAN: I got that package for Freebuger, and it's in your care, Mr. Morgan. Uh, Cady, will you pay the postage due for me? Uh, put it on my bill. POSTMAN: Sign right here. Oh, uh, can Cady sign for me? I burned my hand. Oh, sure, sure. That's uh, $2.80 due. Pay the man, Cady. Thank you. Good night. Good night! Rip a little of the paper away. The money, Sam. You'd better listen, Morgan. You can't win. As soon as you walk out that door, I'll call the sheriff. [CAR DRIVING AWAY] You think he'd believe that an honest grocer, a man with a conscience, would steal? And what if he does? We're willing to run for it. So what, Cady? Sometimes, even an honest grocer can commit murder. What do you mean? Mrs. Pierce is upstairs in her room, dead. Her neck is broken. CADY: Now listen to me good. How will it sound in court, when I pit my word against yours? You were the one running with the money. Your girl posed as Mrs. Pierce. I'll tell the cops, when the real Mrs. Pierce appeared unexpectedly, what could you do but eliminate her? They'll all be after you for murder. You know, it's really funny. CADY: For if ever two innocent people were headed to the gallows, I'm looking at them now. Nothing can save you except me. One thing can save us, Cady. What's that, grocer? The simplest thing in the world... Honesty. Ellie... Phone the sheriff. Tell him everything, tell him the truth. We're giving him the money. It's the answer. You're sure that's what you want, Sam? Yes. Lemme think on it a minute. Think hard, it answers everything. How it hangs Cady... And how it turns us free to be married. It answers everything. Honesty. I don't have to think, Sam. [ELLIE DIALING] Mrs. Pierce was my friend. A kind, gentle woman. You know, I'm coming up here on a certain Friday night. And I'm going to drink one. Not to your health, but to the law. And the rope that hangs you. And when I come up on that certain Friday night, and the clock strikes twelve... I'm not gonna hate. Not this time. Not when they hang you. Hello, Sheriff? You better get over to Cady's Lodge right away. There's been a murder. And we have the money. The money Frankie Pierce stole. You had us, Cady. You had us dead. But you forgot... And I did, too, for a minute, one little word that can clean a man of all his troubles. Truth. Sam, that's where my car hit the puddle and stalled. Yeah. Where we met. Up until that puddle, my life was just like that night. One, big, lousy, continuing storm. Ellie, things still aren't going to be easy. Oh, I don't want them to be easy, Sam. I just want them to be worth the trouble. You make them worth it.
