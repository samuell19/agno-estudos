What new details can I give? Didn't I pay you all these years for nothing? So, give a run through and leave! In October 2014... at Nilgiris hills... there was rumour about a psycho killer on spree The reason for the rumour... were the murders that took place there during that month... and the similarities in all those murders October 8th... 18 years old girl, Gowri... was raped and later murdered using an iron rod There was an X mark carved on her hand using a knife On October 11th, a decomposed corpse was found in the forest The deceased was Chinna, second son of the minister of forest department He was also murdered using an iron rod Two important details... were found in the autopsy report #1. Chinna was murdered 48 hours before his corpse was found #2. He was murdered using the same weapon used to murder Gowri That led to everyone believing that a psycho killer is on the loose It began to grab the headlines But since the state elections were due in couple of months... all the news related to the psycho killer was put on hold October 17th... Victims: Leena Joseph... and Ashok Chandrashekar Based on the statement of Ashok, who survived... there were two murderers but... Inspector Francis who reached there to save Ashok... claimed that there was only one person committing the crime and he too escaped On October 21st, in the town area market... an unidentified 45 year old man's decomposed corpse... with a damaged face similar to the previous murder was found It still remains unidentified Till date, the cops haven't been able to find out this mystery victim The only similarity in all these murders... were the X mark in victims' hand and the way they were murdered Ashok! Here, you get in the car. I'll come You arrived on time, buddy Thanks Hello Where are you guys? Almost getting into the car How long will it take for... Don't you have any sense?

Please -Listen to me -Dude, please act sensibly Ashok, the fault is mine Watch out! What's wrong with you? -Ashok, no -You guys stay put in the car -Dude, listen to me -They are innocent Do you know my dad... Sir, we are innocent. She crossed the road blindly Then why did you run when you saw me? You chased us and we just wanted to avoid any scene Ashok! Please give up He's isn't fighting for you It was that guy's voice "Keep quiet if you want to live!" Say it! Repeat what I said! -But why, sir? -Just say it! Keep quiet if you want to live Say it properly Keep quiet if you want to live Once more! Keep quiet if you want to live -Karthik, go! -Listen to me Instead of working at office in this wether... if we work here, at home... -then your mom will force us to marry -No need You must take a week's off for Ooty trip If you do like this, then you won't have a job when we get married Now, go!

Nonsense. You just don't agree to anything. Karthik... Yes, Preethi? I want to know everything about Leena's murder case. Ashok, dinner Why? I usually step out for dinner Divya and Karthik have taken your car It's raining heavily How will you step out? Thank you I learnt about Leena's murder I read the complete case details Was it interesting? Did I piss you off? I forced Karthik and got all the details Ashok... I want to know everything... about Leena Aren't you a writer? What are you currently writing? Murder mystery? Thriller? These are best selling genres, right? Why don't write about this one too? Don't you know all the details? That's all the details even I know At least... in your story, after the murder... let the killer get caught and be revealed Only then the book will be a hit It'll be quite interesting Do you know what your problem is? You only believe in the negativity that has surrounded you Trying giving others a chance, Ashok You might come across positive things I'm not asking you about Leena's murder I want to know about you and Leena About your relationship Even after five years after her death... you haven't moved on. Tell me about that Anyway... I’m sorry to have hurt you asking about all these Have you come across... someone who spreads nothing but love? Lie, betrayal... ever met someone who doesn't even know what those are? Well, I have My Leena My mother passed away when I was three My father's a school teacher in Ooty My sister is 10 years elder to me She never let me miss my mom When I was seven years old, my sister completed her school She came to Coimbatore for her college First time... I felt lonely in my life A yearning that I couldn't describe The feeling of missing a family That was until I met my Leena The only thing that was common between us... was that we both didn't have a mother at that age After Leena's mother passed away... her father left her with her grandpa... and went abroad Leena lived with her grandpa... expecting someday her father would return It was late before she realized... that her father won't return at all Another thing that was common between us... was loneliness But that loneliness... met it's fate on that day "As love showered upon me..." "it put an end to all my desperation" "She lights up my world..." "with her love" "You are the rainbow in my world" "You are the origin where my life arises" "You are my strength" "I shall take care of you forever" "Just to find you again..." "All the barriers will be gone..." "All the barriers will be gone..." Leena, what are you doing here at this hour? Uncle, I'm alone and feeling scared Can I sleep here tonight? The neighbours will start gossiping I mean it'd be fine if there was a woman living here But only Ashok and I are here It's okay, uncle. No problem. Thank you Lakshmi teacher stays nearby Shall I talk to her? You can sleep at her place tonight No problem, uncle It's okay. No worries No, I'll talk to her It's okay, uncle... Leena!

Come in I've set up the room for you It's okay, Ashok Come on, Leena Come Dad, let Leena sleep in my room I could go with her to her house but poor girl, her grandpa's memories won't let her sleep So, you carry on and go to sleep Thanks for understanding Ashok... Ashok! All these belongs to your sister Ashwini right? No They belong to someone else You look very beautiful Your dad must be hurt, right? All he worries is about what others will talk about us The whole town has been watching us both for years What new would they have to gossip now? Grandpa was all over the house, all the time You can hear his voice round the clock But the silence now... makes me realize how big that house is I know it very well I am one among those who run for their lives when your grandpa shouts Do you know, he actually liked you -Stop kidding -I'm serious My uncle married a girl from a different religion Grandpa never approved it He knew I am with you all the time But he never spoke a word against it What happened to your uncle later? He came back many times, begging grandpa to accept him and his family But grandpa never took him back in Later what happened to him and about his whereabouts... Well, I have no idea about it Leena... can I ask you something? What is it? I don't know if this is the right time Your grandpa just passed away You must be heartbroken -I... -Stop beating around the bush Let's get married. What do you say? Okay Okay? That was spontaneous We both know that eventually we are going to marry each other On top of that, I don't have anyone to ask for permission... but you So is it ok to marry you? Will it be a correct decision? No matter what you do, you'll never find a perfect guy like me Let's get married. Nothing wrong in it "As the distance fades away..." "you fill my life with love and light" "As my heart gets drenched in your love..." "we become inseparable" "In this whole world..." "you're the sole meaning of my life" "A language that is understood universally..." "is the language of love, which I see in your eyes" "I wake up in my dreams..." "like the waves arise, just to find you again" "Barriers will be gone..." "like a volcano settles down and our love will be strong forever" "All the barriers will be gone" "All the barriers will be gone" "Oh my angel..." "All the barriers will be gone" "As the distance fades away..." "you fill my life with love and light" "As my heart gets drenched in your love..."

You guys leave You didn't give me a reply yet Let's give it some time, Preethi Let's take a break After that... what?

'Promise me whatever happens you will never hate me' 'You will never leave me' 'I advice you to please move on' 'You are searching in the darkness' 'I tried my best Ashok' 'I did not find any lead' 'Enough of ruining your life, Ashok' 'Life has to move on, Ashok' 'If that day ever comes...' 'and if you find the murderer...' 'what can you do, Ashok?' 'How will you prove it was him?' "Keep quiet if you want to live!" Is that all? Anything else? Ashok... think harder We didn't find any other clue Did the second guy say anything? He didn't speak at all The biggest mistake I made that day was... that I failed to ensure you were dead I must have murdered you nice and slow Keep quiet if you want to live! Dear brother! How did you trace us out? You never saw our faces! I was searching for this voice all these years What? In the end your brother, who can't speak, led me to you Voice? My voice? "Keep quiet if you want to live!" You said it twice to me Today's I won't show mercy Whether you keep quiet or scream... you ain't going out alive from here Leave me! I'll finish him off! Fine, since he roughed you up... Go! Finish him off! Let go of him! Excuse me Excuse me Listen you mongrel... I am going to finish off your brother now Keep quiet and enjoy the show We didn't murder that girl We aren't the psycho killers You guys murdered her right in front of me No! A third person came there on that day A guy named Kaasi He gave us that contract to murder We are just the henchmen Who is that Kaasi? Kaasi is no more The fourth murder claimed to be committed by that psycho killer... The corpse found in the market That was Kaasi Even the police couldn't trace out whose corpse it was So stop it with your stories No one can trace him! He is like a ghost Murdering is his profession Blabber all you want, you're still dying today! We were offered five lakh rupees to murder that girl What did you say? One day he came with a job proposal The job was near Ooty... so we were hesitant He offered us five lakhs and we took it up We monitored the girl's house for one whole week She didn't step out at all Back then the psycho killer rumour was spreading quickly Kaasi planned to kill the girl following the psycho killer pattern Atlast, the girl came out with you Kaasi was not with us then He asked us to carry out the job He asked us not to kill the girl until he arrives After learning that you went to the hilltop... He told us the location where we must corner you We did not expect the police to come in search of you Right when we decided to kill the girl and runaway, Kaasi came there We came to know that Kaasi died after four days We were scared about getting caught, so we left Ooty We did not return for three years I am not ready to believe your stories Because Kaasi is dead You don't know anything too Then, whom shall I go in search of? I swear, we did not kill that girl You killed my brother. Now leave me I will leave this village I will never come in your way I am not convinced Give me any information that might save your life I shall consider leaving you alive then I know where Kaasi stayed when we were monitoring the girl for a week After the girl died... the next three days... we went to the house... to get the remaining money But he did not turn up After that night I did not see him at all Where? How does Kaasi look like? As tall as you But darker and beefed up Sir Who is it? One of my old friend named Kaasi... used to live in this address four years before. Do you know him? -What did you say his name was? -Kaasi How does he look? Black, beefed up and as tall as me Most of the men in this village go with your specifications? He was here for sometime He stayed for a month. Do you remember him? Sorry, I don't remember Grandpa! Don't you remember me? Ashok! You changed a lot How are you? I am fine Let me take that It's alright How are you? I am doing okay My children... stopped caring for me I came back to my hometown What are you doing here? My house is around here. Don't you know? Here? Third house on the right by the street ahead I am living there for 10 years I came here searching for a person He used to live in the 5th house in the street A dark guy As tall as I am Kaasi He was staying here when Leena died Do you know him? Please think about it It's been 5 years I know him I know he used to live here He was here only for a brief period One day your inspector friend came here looking for him. He was an inspector then. Now he has become DSP Francis? Yes, him When did he come? It was around that time Since all shops are closed here on Sundays... I went to town to buy medicines for my wife... and returned in the middle of the night Dear... Francis... Grandpa! Is that you? What are you doing at this hour? I came here to interrogate someone -He is not at home -A new guy lives here right? I think his name is Kaasi... right? Yeah. But not now... He is not at home now -Is there a problem dear? -Nothing. You go ahead Sunday... do you remember the date? Something happened then...

Go ahead After Leena, the fourth person who was murdered in the market place... The person whom you couldn't identify His name is Kaasi What? Kaasi is a contract killer Leena was not murdered by any psycho killer Kaasi and his two accomplices were the culprit What are you saying? How do you know these? I don't know who paid Kaasi to kill Leena But... five years ago, he was acquainted... with you, Francis What? I have the proof that you went in search of Kaasi On October 20th A day before when Kaasi was found murdered in the market When you knew Kaasi... why did you close the case as unidentifiable? What are you getting at Ashok? Know your limits! I let you in and sit here because of the respect I have for Leena You are the last person who met him On the day of Leena's death! Who ordered to kill Leena? Was it you? That's it, Ashok! I don't want to answer your stupid questions I came to save Leena. I could not do it... But it was me, who saved your life This conversation is over You can leave Ashok, what are you doing? Stop it I found the voice I was searching for these many years Two of them. They were brothers They told me about Kaasi They begged a lot Sir, please let me go... Sir... Sir.. please don't do it Sir! Sir! I finished them off Stop your drama You eyes are full of lies Tell me Tell me what you know I have no humane intentions at all right now Tell me So you want to know who the psycho killer is? You want me to tell you who killed Leena? Who? Who is it? Who is it? What do you want? We were passing by My brother is having breathing trouble Please give some water. It's urgent -Where? -Here? Please madam. It's urgent. Please bring some water Wake up buddy Sister, come fast. Come here Wake up man. Wake up I have been watching you for some time. You look beautiful You rascal! Mind you! Hold her legs tight! How dare you hit my brother? Aren't you ashamed to get hit by a girl? Make sure no one is in here Will see to it Where is that? Move! Move Why are you drinking water? Did you even do anything? Won't you teach your brother all this? Chinna what are you doing? Move away if you can't do it Look at him Dad is calling me repeatedly. We are leaving Starting trouble? Selvam, won't you teach your brother all this? Move away if you can't do it You let them do it. Why not me? Answer me! Gowri! Gowri! Leena What happened? Minister Mariappan's son Chinna was lying dead there Leena's life would be in trouble if news gets out I had no clue on what to do It was almost sunrise I decided to cover up things so that Leena won't be suspected Murders by a psycho killer usually follow a same pattern Sometimes they leave an inscription or words after the murder In order to divert the case... I created the whole psycho killer saga Just do as I say for the next few days Make sure this stays between us Don't even tell Ashok Okay? After couple of hours... I asked her to call the cops She came home after sunrise... and found Gowri dead. This is the statement I asked her to make Why didn't you file this as a police case? A girl undergoes so much trouble and you chose to stay quiet Try to understand, Ashok? You don't know about Minister Mariappan He had murdered a lot of people to become the Minister A missing complaint on Chinna was filed the next day from Minister's office Stop pestering us! I was being pressured by my superiors I got into Mariappan's house on the pretext of investigating I decided to over hear all their conversations I bugged the entire house It was then I learnt something unexpected Gowri was murdered not just by Chinna... but his brother and his friends too were involved I thought I had lost it all Selvam started having doubts when news about Gowri got out Because... he did not carve the X mark on her when he left Without knowing any of this... I made a mark on her hand Even then they were clueless about Chinna But after they got the body... They found out that Leena was the murderer How? The only reason the pervert came back to the house was... to prove himself to those who laughed at him You made fun of me, right Now watch this The last thing that he did in his life... turned everyone's life upside down! Come on, dad Watch out, sir Chinna! Chinna! Selvam! We must kill her brutally -Come on -Let's go Mari, sit down She killed my son I know, now sit down -It was a girl, after all -Be patient Are you asking me to let her go? We shall do it, now sit down Be patient Election is just two weeks away Everyone are waiting for us to make a mistake Your anger might spoil your entire political career You guys don't seem to understand at all You or Selvam should not be involved in this Let me hire some men She created a rumour about psycho killer I will use the idea to kill her Come on, uncle! Chinna is gone! Are you asking me to let that go? -I know -Damn it! None of us should be directly involved in this The one who does the job should not know that he is doing it for us We should not know about the person who does the job The girl.... I will make sure she dies I will ensure that Please be quiet until then Cut off the links to the media The case should not be blown up at all High profile murders like these... will have several layers The person who commits the murder... will not even know for whom he did it I did not know who the murderer was I did not know where to look for Leena cannot leave the place It was risky for her even to step out of the house I came to know you two had headed out... and searched for you everywhere Atlast, I tracked you But it was late I killed Kaasi Leena! Leena! Leena! Ashok! Ashok! I went to Kaasi's room to destroy his ID cards But there was nothing there Where is Minister Mariappan? Two heart attacks... has made him an ex minister Mariappan lives in his estate here He is bedridden I have been struggling for five years! You knew these all this time... Ashok, please understand... Had I told you, you would have set out for revenge They would not have spared your life too How do I believe all this? I saved your life You want proof, right. Come along When Mariappan's brother and Selvam... were planning to kill Leena I recorded this after I bugged Mariappan's house I need you to do me a favour Ashok, you still have a life ahead of you Do not spoil your life Leena will not come back again Can you do it or not? What is it? Someone has parked in middle of the road I am not sure where he went. Let me check, sir Driver! Sir, no one is inside Look around Driver! Where are you? Driver! Sir, the key is in the ignition -I will move it aside -Make it fast Sir, let's leave Sir Sir? Sir! Who are you? Let go of my hands! Recognise me? Remember Leena? You killed her right here Hello What are you saying? Sir, the car is missing Sir, please come here When I came back... He was... Sir, even the car is missing now Hey, are you drunk? Blow your mouth Sir, no sir I said, blow your mouth -No sir -Tell me the truth -Sir, no sir -You will be done with Sir This is a deserted road There are no signs of car tyres here Did you pick up Selvam? Sir, I am telling the truth I parked the car there I came back here He was missing What shall we do? Shall we call our men to search in the forest? Call minister's house and check if Selvam has arrived there Sir You both killed my brother... and you expect me to be a mute spectator? A girl... just because she slapped your brother... you gang raped her and killed her Your brother... went back and... Damn it! And you guys are saints... and you talk as if murdering you is a sin! What did you say? “You both killed my brother” What did I do? You are going to kill me anyhow Why do you act innocent? I heard your voice... when my brother called me that night What? Chinna, tell me Save... me... What are you saying? Are you high? Have you started drinking again? What happened? He is boozing again with someone Alcohol is going to kill him soon You were always with her, weren’t you? You killed my brother Selvam... I am going to kill one more person today Guess who? -Bhaskar... -Sir Everyone except Minister should be assembled here -Right now -Okay, sir Come over and stand in line Everyone come here -Sir -Call the station Okay, sir -Ask them to inform all other stations -Yes, sir Organize a search team and send them to the location Collect everyone's cell phones. I need all incoming and outgoing call details. -Interrogate everyone separately -Okay, sir -Quick -Give me your mobiles 'Former minister of environment and forest development ...' 'Mr. Mariappan passed away earlier today' 'Chief Minister and other political leaders are offering their condolence' 'Following the demise of the minister...' 'in a new turn of events, his elder son Selvam ...' 'is missing since yesterday evening...' Sheela -Shall we move? -Coming 'He was on his way to Ooty from Coimbatore airport' You laughed at me right, now watch I heard your voice... when my brother called me that night The video from Chinna's phone How did you acquire it on the same day he died? Leena considered you to be her family How could you betray her? Sorry, Ashok. I have no other option You have to die Hello, Francis Hello! Francis Ashok! Is Leena alive, Francis? How? Tell me, Francis! Tell me! Tell me! Tell me! Tell me! What did you do to Leena? Francis! Tell me, Francis Francis Tell me. Francis! Francis! After my grandfather's death... I came here to claim my rightful share of his assets When I came here... this house... You and Leena made it your own house No one thought that I had a share in this too When Leena was treated like a queen in the house... my family was struggling for a meal My father and I had been here many times But we had never stepped inside The old man did not like my father marrying out of the religion What's my fault? You and Leena did the same Was that alright? It was then I decided... Leena lived here all these years... I decided it was my turn I could not go around begging for it When I was not sure about what to do... the opportunity presented itself... in the form of Gowri's murder When I came to the house that night... Selva... Save me... That night I saw the video from Chinna's mobile I kept it inside Chinna's dress In case if they fail to kill Leena... I should be able to kill her without suspicion That's why I really created the psycho killer saga When Leena dies... I could take the house... But my plan was foiled the very next day When I came to this house to officially investigate Gowri's murder I read the old man's will In the absence of Leena, the house shall not be owned by anyone... other than the church, it said Even in his final moments, he did not think about me I thought things through Suddenly everything was clear to me The video I saved from Chinna's mobile... proved useful I told Leena's father everything I warned him that they would kill Leena Even if they don't kill her... With the video I have... I made him realize that I could do anything to her... The only way Leena could live was... by being dead to the world To execute this, I demanded two things... First, the house must be mine Second... Ashok and Leena should not be together He did not think twice He accepted immediately The only point I slipped was... when you and Leena... went out without informing anyone If I had come a little late... Kaasi would have killed Leena The only mistake I did... was showing pity on you... and saving your life To convince Leena that you were dead... was a daunting task She begged to see your corpse for one last time... Her father blackmailed her emotionally He convinced her somehow and sent her away from there From the Government mortuary... I took a corpse that looked like Leena I made sure the face was unrecognizable The next day, her father came in... and identified the body... Who would question after that? For safety, I called your sister too... She also believed that it was Leena I want to talk to Leena Ashok! Ashok! Leena is married and has a child She has come to India for the first time after five years She is in Goa with her family She is calling me to visit her If she finds out you are alive... Imagine what will happen to her Ashok! Ashok! Listen to me... Please leave this town at once I will inform you next week... Make sure there is a record of you being at your office A murder will take place here right then There is an accused here Any how our department is planning to kill him... I will kill him in the same pattern as the psycho killer No one could link you with that murder Move on, Ashok You still have your life to live For Leena... you are dead... Let it stay that way "As love showered upon..." "it put an end to all the desperation" "She lights up my world..." "with her love" "You are the rainbow in my world" "You are the origin where my life arises" "My life belongs to you" "I will always protect you in my heart" "Our love is immortal" 'Selvam, the elder son of the deceased former Minister Mariappan...' 'was murdered in a mysterious way' 'The murder pattern resembles the series of murders that happened five years ago' 'We shall ask DSP Francis about this' People believe that the psycho killer from five years back is out again Have you arrested anyone related to the case? We have arrested four people out of suspicion Sir, we need a clear picture on this We are doing our best The psycho killer cannot escape this time We will definitely arrest him Thank you, sir Ashok What happened? I fell down Are you leaving? Please, Ashok Don't leave Don't go in search of that murderer I am not going anywhere I am not going to take any revenge I want to start a new life, Preethi... "Everything just kept moving on" "But the memories were frozen" "As the shriek was heard all over" "The sight sent a shudder down the spine " "Now everything is broken and shattered" "It's all over! Why did all this happen?"
