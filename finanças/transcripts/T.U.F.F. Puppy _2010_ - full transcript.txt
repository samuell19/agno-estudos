IT'S TOO HARD! - OH, FORGET THE CUPCAKES. DEACTIVATE THAT BOMB! - YEAH, KITTY, BE RESPONSIBLE FOR ONCE AND DISARM THE BOMB. - WHAT? - WE BOTH KNOW I'M NOT GONNA DO IT, OR DO IT WELL. WHEN HAVE I EVER PICKED THE RIGHT WIRE? [munching] - I CAN'T BELIEVE IT! YOU TRICKED ME SO YOU COULD EAT BOTH CUPCAKES. - THAT'S NOT WHAT IT LOOKS LIKE. I, UH... I DID IT FOR YOU, 'CAUSE... THE CHAMELEON POISONED THEM. - OH, I DID? OH, I MEAN, YES, I DID! - DUDLEY, YOUR EYE IS TWITCHING. OH, NO. THE POISON'S STARTING TO TAKE EFFECT. WHY WOULD YOU EAT POISON CUPCAKES TO SAVE ME? WHY DIDN'T YOU JUST THROW THEM AWAY? - UH, BECAUSE I PANICKED. WHENEVER I PANIC, I EAT CUPCAKES. - I CAN'T BELIEVE YOU POISONED AGENT PUPPY. I'M IMPRESSED, CHAMELEON. - YEAH. IF IT'S TRUE, I WOULD THINK YOU WERE SUPER COOL. - EEH! WELL, THEN, YES, I AM SUPER COOL BECAUSE I DEFINITELY POISONED HIM. IT WAS ALL PART OF MY CLEVER PLAN INVOLVING... EVIL FROSTED BAKED GOODS. - THAT'S DEFINITELY MORE CLEVER THAN MY "SEND A BOMB TO T.U.F.F. WHILE I'M IN THE HOLDING CELL" PLAN. - YOU SENT THAT BOMB? YOU BUFFOON! YOU COULD HAVE ANNIHILATED US ALL. - YEAH, PLANNING'S NOT MY STRONG SUIT. MY WOOL SUIT IS MY STRONG SUIT. THAT FABRIC IS DURABLE! - DON'T WORRY, AGENT PUPPY. I CAN MAKE AN ANTIDOTE. I'LL J-JUST NEED A HAIR SAMPLE... - [yelps] - TO PUT IN MY POISON DETECTOR. - UH, RANDOM QUESTION. WOULD YOUR DETECTOR ALSO KNOW IF THE CUPCAKE WASN'T POISONED AT ALL? - [chuckles] OF COURSE. - SORRY! I PANICKED! - I'LL BE IN MY LAB MANUALLY TESTING AGENT P-PUPPY'S HAIR. IT'S GOING TO TAKE QUITE A WHILE THANKS TO TRIGGER-FINGERS MCGEE. - DUDLEY, TODAY MAY BE YOUR LAST DAY, SO I'M GONNA MAKE IT THE BEST DAY OF OUR LIFE. WE CAN DO ANYTHING YOU WANT! - THAT'S OKAY, KIT-- WAIT. DID YOU SAY, "ANYTHING"? I DO HAVE A LIST OF THINGS THAT NO ONE ELSE WOULD EVER DO WITH ME... MAINLY BECAUSE NO ONE CAN READ MY HANDWRITING. - YOU GOT IT! LET'S GO HAVE FUN! [sobs] - WELL, CHAMELEON, I HAVE A NEWFOUND RESPECT FOR YOU. WHEN THIS WHOLE JAIL THING IS OVER, WOULD YOU CARE TO ENGAGE IN A PREPLANNED SOCIAL ACTIVITY WITH US? - YEAH, HANGING OUT WITH THE GUY WHO POISONED AGENT PUPPY WOULD REALLY UP MY EVIL STREET CRED. - OOH! OH, I AM SO EXCITED. PREPLANNED SOCIAL ACTIVITY WITH MY NEW FRIENDS, HERE I COME! [laughs] - WHOA. WHY DON'T YOU DO THAT ALL THE TIME? - WELL, BECAUSE UNTIL NOW, BEING LOCKED IN THE HOLDING CELL WAS THE ONLY WAY YOU'D HANG OUT WITH ME. NOW WE CAN DO EVERYTHING ON MY "WHAT I'D DO IF I HAD FRIENDS" LIST. - "SHARE POPCORN AT THE MOVIES. "GET MATCHING T-SHIRTS. "RELEASE A CHEMICAL INTO THE WATER SUPPLY THAT WILL TURN EVERYONE INTO BUGS THAT WE SHALL EAT"? - OH, COME ON, IT'LL BE GREAT. - I'M IMPRESSED, BUDDY. - [gasps] YOU VOLUNTARILY TOUCHED ME IN AN AFFECTIONATE WAY! - THANK YOU, KITTY! I'VE ALWAYS WANTED TO BE THE KING OF MY OWN ICE CREAM CASTLE. THIS IS AWESOME! - I'M GLAD YOU'RE HAPPY, DUDLEY. I ONLY HAD TO USE MY ENTIRE WEEK'S PAYCHECK TO BUY ALL THIS ICE CREAM. [sobs] - THERE'S THE MEAN LADY WHO BOUGHT ALL THE ICE CREAM IN TOWN! GET HER! [indistinct shouting] - [screams] - I'M SORRY, KITTY. WOULD YOU LIKE ME TO ICE YOUR WELTS WITH SOME RAINBOW SHERBET? AT LEAST WHEN YOU LICK YOUR WOUNDS, IT'LL TASTE GOOD. - NO, DUDLEY. IT COULD BE YOUR LAST DAY. YOU SHOULD HAVE ALL THE ICE CREAM TO YOURSELF. ALSO, I WON'T BE ABLE TO SWALLOW FOR A WHILE. [sobs] - KITTY, THANKS FOR SELLING YOUR CAR TO BUY OUR WAY INTO THIS UNDERGROUND SUMO WRESTLING MATCH. IT'S ALWAYS BEEN MY DREAM TO FIGHT A GIANT HIPPO IN A DIAPER. - YEAH, SOME PEOPLE JUST WANT TO GO TO HAWAII. ARE YOU SURE YOU'RE UP FOR THIS WITH THE POISON AND ALL? - THE--THE WHAT? OH, YES! UH, YEAH, I AM... FEELING SOME... SLIGHT POISON PROBLEMS. BUT, UH, I CAN TAKE HIM. HE MAY BE BIG AND HAVE A COOL DIAPER, BUT I HAVE SPEED AND A SUGAR RUSH FROM EATING MY ICE CREAM CROWN. [gong crashes] - [grunts] - WAIT. WHERE'S KITTY? DARN IT! SHE MISSED MY GREAT MOVE. - NO, I DIDN'T. I'D CLAP BUT MY ARMS ARE PINNED DOWN. - ISN'T THIS GREAT? THE THREE OF US BESTIES HANGING OUT IN OUR MATCHING PJs! THEY'RE AN OUTWARD SIGN OF HOW COMFORTABLE WE ARE AS FRIENDS. - WHO'S COMFORTABLE? THESE PJs ARE TOTALLY RIDING UP MY BLUE BOTTOM. - SUCK IT UP, BIRD BRAIN. IT'S WORTH IT TO HANG OUT WITH THE GUY WHO POISONED AGENT PUPPY. - YES, I DEFINITELY DID THAT... WITH POISON. SO, RANDOM QUESTION. IF AGENT PUPPY WAS ALIVE TOMORROW, YOU GUYS WOULD STOP BEING MY FRIENDS? - OF COURSE WE'D STOP. - DULY NOTED. I'VE GOT TO GO GET RID OF AGENT PUPPY FOR REAL. I MEAN, GET US FRIENDSHIP BRACELETS! - WHY DO YOU WANT ME TO GO IN THE FOUNTAIN AGAIN? - TO COLLECT ALL THE WISH PENNIES. THEY'RE BETTER THAN REGULAR PENNIES 'CAUSE EACH ONE COMES WITH A WISH. - DUDLEY, I'M NOT SURE THAT'S HOW IT WORKS. - SURE IT IS. ONCE YOU GET THE PENNIES, THE FOUNTAIN FAIRY HAS TO GRANT MY WISH THAT I WAS ACTUALLY POISONED BUT MY SUPER STRONG BODY FOUGHT IT OFF AND YOU NEVER FOUND OUT I LIED TO YOU ABOUT BEING POISONED. - WHAT? - SORRY, KITTY. I MEANT YOU SHOULD GET THE WISH NICKELS TOO. THEY'RE WORTH FIVE WISHES EACH. - AAH! - HEY, EVERYBODY! THAT MEAN LADY STOLE OUR WISHES! GET HER! [indistinct shouting] [communicator chirps] - AGENT PUPPY, GOOD NEWS. IT TURNS OUT YOU HAVEN'T BEEN P-POISONED. - SORRY! CAN'T HEAR YOU! GOING THROUGH A TUNNEL! - YOU KNOW I CAN SEE YOU'RE IN THE MALL. - NO, I'M NOT! - SORRY I LET YOU DOWN, DUDLEY. MY SUDDEN BUT NECESSARY HOSPITALIZATION GOT IN THE WAY OF YOUR SPECIAL DAY. - THAT'S OKAY. THERE WILL BE MANY MORE-- I MEAN, I'M POISONED. ANYWAY, KITTY, THIS HAS BEEN THE BEST DAY OF MY LIFE. - AND THE WORST OF MINE. BUT I'D DO IT ALL AGAIN IF IT MEANT SPENDING MORE TIME WITH YOU. DUDLEY, YOU'RE NOT JUST MY PARTNER, YOU'RE MY BEST FRIEND. [sobs] CAN YOU DRY MY EYES? THE LITTLE CHIPMUNK GIRL DISLOCATED MY SHOULDERS. - LISTEN, KITTY. THERE'S SOMETHING I NEED TO TELL YOU. - YOU CAN TELL ME ANYTHING. - REALLY? YOU PROMISE NOT TO GET MAD? - [sniffles] MM-HMM. - I WASN'T POISONED. I JUST DIDN'T WANT YOU TO BE MAD BECAUSE I ATE YOUR CUPCAKES. WHEW! OKAY! YEAH! FEELS GOOD TO GET THAT OFF MY CHEST. - DUDLEY, HOW COULD YOU? AAH! - YOU PROMISED YOU WOULDN'T GET MAD! I FEEL LIKE YOU'RE MAD! - CUPCAKE DELIVERY FOR AGENT PUPPY. - YEAH! MORE CUPCAKES FOR ME! MM-HMM! - YOU? I'M THE ONE WHO'S INJURED! - KITTY, YOU'RE RIGHT. YOU DID SO MUCH FOR ME AFTER I TRICKED YOU, I'M GONNA DO THE RIGHT THING... [sobs] AND GIVE... UNGH! GI-GI-GI-- - GIVE THEM TO ME? - YES! YES! YOU CAN HAVE MY CUP-- [stammers] YOU CAN HAVE MY COO-- AAH! AAH! - CUPCAKES? - YES, TAKE THEM! JUST HERE! THEY'RE YOURS! [sobs hysterically] - [grunts] COULD YOU AT LEAST PUT THEM A LITTLE CLOSER? - NO! - [laughs] EXCELLENT. SOON, AGENT PUPPY WILL EAT THOSE POISON CUPCAKES BUT I'LL GET TO KEEP MY TWO BEST PALS. NOW TO THE MALL KIOSK FOR WACKY FRIENDSHIP BRACELETS AND CRAZY KEEPSAKES WE'LL CHERISH FOREVER! - WAIT A MINUTE. THEY SELL FRIENDSHIP BRACELETS AT THE MALL? ALSO, THE DELIVERY GUY WAS THE CHAMELEON AND HE POISONED THOSE CUPCAKES! I GOTTA SAVE KITTY! KITTY! KITTY! - [grunts] - [grunts] - WHAT IS WRONG WITH YOU? - YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND. - OH, SURE I DO. YOU COULDN'T EVEN LET ME HAVE A CUPCAKE. ARE YOU REALLY THAT SELFISH? - LET ME EXPLAIN. - THERE'S NOTHING TO EXPLAIN. YOU WANT THE CUPCAKES ALL FOR YOURSELF AND IT'S JUST NOT HAPPENING. THIS IS FOR THE ICE CREAM CASTLE. - [grunts] - AND THIS IS FOR THE SUMO WRESTLING. - OW! - AND THIS IS FOR THE PENNY DIVING! - AAH! - YOU KNOW, I REALLY HATE DOING THIS, NOT BECAUSE IT HURTS YOU, BUT BECAUSE MY SHOULDERS ARE DISLOCATED! - I KNOW YOU'RE NOT GONNA BELIEVE THIS, BUT THE CHAMELEON POISONED THESE CUPCAKES. - OH, COME ON. AT LEAST MAKE UP A NEW LIE THIS TIME. - IT'S NOT A LIE AND I WILL PROVE IT TO YOU! [munching] DIDN'T THINK THIS THROUGH. [coughs, grunts] - NICE TRY, DUDLEY. [echoing] DUDLEY? - WHAT HAPPENED? - YOU ATE A POISONED CUPCAKE TO SAVE ME... FOR REAL THIS TIME. - LUCKILY YOU WERE IN THE HOSPITAL, SO THEY WERE ABLE TO SAVE YOU. BY THE WAY, THANK YOU. - SO YOU'RE NOT MAD AT ME? - WELL, I'M A LITTLE UPSET BECAUSE I THOUGHT THIS WAS A PRIVATE ROOM, BUT IF THERE'S ANYONE I HAVE TO SHARE A HOSPITAL ROOM WITH, I'M GLAD IT'S YOU. - [gulps] - DID YOU JUST EAT MY "GET WELL SOON" CANDY? - YES, BUT ONLY BECAUSE IT WAS...POISONED. - [grunts] - TOOT-TOOT! ALL ABOARD THE BRAID TRAIN! - WELL, AT LEAST I'VE GOT HAIR. - SORRY TO INTERRUPT YOUR BRAID TRAIN, LADIES, BUT THE CHAMELEON'S UNDER ARREST FOR TRYING TO POISON ME. - AND ME! - NO, I WAS THE ONLY TARGET. IT'S NOT ALWAYS ABOUT YOU, KITTY, OKAY? - WAIT A MINUTE. AGENT PUPPY, YOU'RE STILL ALIVE? - WHAT? YOU MEAN WE'VE BEEN HANGING OUT WITH THIS LOSER FOR A WEEK FOR NOTHING? - I THINK I'M READY TO GO TO JAIL NOW FOR MY OWN PROTECTION. - THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME, LADIES. AS YOU WERE. THOSE WERE TWO VERY UNATTRACTIVE WOMEN, KITTY. - [laughs] HE DIDN'T RECOGNIZE US. WE'RE FREE! - YES, BUT THERE'S ONE SMALL SNAFU. I ACCIDENTALLY SENT A BOMB TO WHERE I AM AGAIN! [beeps] [explosion] [lively spy music] ? ? - THIS IS AMAZING, DUDLEY. I CAN'T BELIEVE YOU WON A CONTEST FOR A HAWAIIAN VACATION. - I NEVER LOSE A CONTEST, KITTY. I EITHER WIN THEM OR QUIT THEM BECAUSE SOMEONE ELSE WON. - NUTS? - YEAH. SHE IS A LITTLE CRAZY, BUT SHE'S MY PARTNER, SO I BROUGHT HER WITH ME. ALSO, DO YOU HAVE ANY SALTY SNACKS? YOU KNOW WHAT'S WEIRD, KITTY? I DON'T REMEMBER ENTERING THE CONTEST I WON. I'D SAY IT'S A LITTLE SUSPICIOUS, BUT I REALLY WANNA GO TO HAWAII! - ME TOO. A WEEK AWAY FROM CRIME AND BAD GUYS SOUNDS AMAZING. - WHAT'S UP, LOSERS? - SNAPTRAP? WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE? - MR. SNUGGLETRAP WON A CONTEST, AND I WAS THRILLED HE PICKED ME AS HIS PLUS-ONE. - I LOVE YOU. LET'S ROB A CONVENIENT STORE TOGETHER. - AWW, WHO'S A CUTE, LITTLE FELON? YOU ARE. YES, YOU ARE. - NUTS. - NO, THANKS. - NO, I MEANT YOU'RE CRAZY. - DON'T TELL ME YOU'RE STAYING AT THE ROYAL MACADAMIA UKULELE HULA RESORT AND MOTOR LODGE. - ALL RIGHT, I WON'T. BUT I TOTALLY AM! - LOOK, SNAPTRAP, I WORKED REALLY HARD TO WIN THIS CONTEST I DON'T REMEMBER ENTERING, AND THE LAST THING I NEED IS FOR YOU TO RUIN MY VACATION. - AND THE LAST THING I NEED IS THIS TUNA-FLAVORED LIP GLOSS. - GET YOUR HAND OUT OF MY PURSE! - LET'S JUST MAKE A GENTLEMEN'S AGREEMENT TO STAY OUT OF EACH OTHER'S WAY. - OKAY, BUT YOU'RE GONNA HAVE TO MAKE IT WITH MR. SNUGGLETRAP 'CAUSE I'M NO GENTLEMAN. - SNAPTRAP, YOU'RE BLOCKING OUR SUN. - SORRY. MR. SNUGGLETRAP HAS A FAIR COMPLEXION. ALSO, IF IT'S TOO BRIGHT, HE'LL GO BLIND IN HIS LITTLE, BLACK BUTTON EYES. FORTUNATELY HIS TINY SUNGLASSES CAME WITH HIS MALIBU FUN-SIZED SWIM TRUNKS. - WHOA! - JUST KIDDING. I STOLE IT FROM A TODDLER. - LET'S GET OUT OF HERE, KITTY. KITTY? HUH? SHE JUST TOOK OFF AND MADE A MESS. THAT'S NORMALLY MY THING. [sniffs] UGH! HER TUNA-FLAVORED LIP GLOSS SMELLS LIKE A BEACHED WHALE. NO, I'M WRONG. IT'S THAT GUY. - JUST TRYING TO GET A TAN, BUDDY. - ALL-YOU-CAN-EAT FROZEN YOGURT? YOU BET I CAN EAT IT ALL! - NOT IF I EAT IT FIRST, LOSER! MR. SNUGGLETRAP, TAKE A PICTURE OF ME EATING ALL THE FROYO. LUCKILY HIS LITTLE CAMERA CAME WITH HIS SNAZZY, TROPICAL ENSEMBLE. JUST KIDDING! I STOLE IT FROM A TINY PHOTOGRAPHER. - I WAS HERE FIRST! NO CUTSIES! - I'LL GIVE YOU CUTSIES IF YOU GET BETWEEN ME AND MY YOGURT. WELL, IT'S A SPOON, SO TECHNICALLY IT'LL BE "SCOOPSIES." [both grunting] - WILL A MR. VERMINIOUS SNAPTRAP AND ONE DUDLEY PUPPY PLEASE REPORT TO THE ALOHA CONFERENCE ROOM? - JUAN DUDLEY PUPPY? THAT'S MY COUSIN FROM BARCELONA! HE MUST HAVE WON A CONTEST THAT HE DIDN'T ENTER TOO. - I WONDER WHAT THEY WANT WITH ME. EITHER I WON A RAFFLE FOR A FREE HULA LESSON OR THEY FOUND OUT I TRIED TO ROUGH UP THAT SNOT-NOSED KID IN THE SURF SHOP. A FOOT DOCTOR CONFERENCE? WHO'D LET A FOOT BE A DOCTOR? - WHO CARES? THERE'S BUNION CREAM AND A LUKEWARM FRUIT TRAY! WHOEVER CALLED THIS MEETING REALLY KNOWS HOW TO THROW A PARTY. - IT WAS ME! both: AAH! THE WEASEL! HE'S EVIL! [screaming] - STOP! YOU'VE BEEN SCREAMING FOR TEN MINUTES, WHICH ONLY LEAVES ME FIVE TO TELL YOU MY EVIL PLAN BEFORE THE TIME-SHARE CONFERENCE KICKS ME OUT. - WE CAN'T HELP IT. YOU'RE THE MOST DIABOLICAL VILLAIN IN PETROPOLIS, AND WE KNOW THAT YOU HATE US! - OF COURSE I DO. YOU MORONS PUT ME IN JAIL... TWICE! - ONLY BECAUSE YOU TRIED TO ANNIHILATE US...TWICE! WHAT DO YOU WANT, WEASEL? - REVENGE! I FAKED THE CONTEST TO GET YOU HERE, KIDNAPPED AGENT KATSWELL AND YOUR PRECIOUS MR. SNUGGLETRAP, AND TIED THEM UP IN A CAVE ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE ISLAND. - OH, NO! KITTY! - WHO CARES ABOUT HER? LOOK AT POOR MR. SNUGGLETRAP! YOUR ROPES ARE SO TIGHT, HIS LITTLE, BLACK BUTTON EYES ARE BULGING! - THE ONLY WAY TO GET TO YOUR FRIENDS IS TO GO THROUGH THE JUNGLE WHICH I'VE RIGGED WITH LETHAL BOOBY TRAPS. YOU NUMBSKULLS HAVE UNTIL HIGH TIDE TO SAVE THEM OR THEY'LL BE SLEEPING WITH THE FISHES! - MY SKULL IS NUMB, BUT THAT COULD BE FROM ALL THE FROYO. ALSO, WHEN'S HIGH TIDE? - IT'S IN THREE HOURS! WEASEL, OUT! - THREE HOURS? THERE'S NO TIME TO WASTE! - WE CAN'T LET ANYTHING DISTRACT US! THIS YOGURT MACHINE TOTALLY DISTRACTED US. - WE'RE WASTING TIME WITH THESE CUPS. WE SHOULD JUST TAKE THE WHOLE MACHINE. - THAT'S GENIUS! LET'S FLY LIKE THE WIND! [both grunting] WHEW! I AM TOTALLY WINDED. ALSO, I'M BREAKING A LOT OF WIND. YOGURT GIVES ME TRUMPET BUTT. [flatulence] - I THOUGHT THAT SMELL WAS COMING FROM THAT BEACHED WHALE OVER THERE. - JUST TRYING TO GET A TAN, BUDDY. - ANYWAY, LET'S GET BACK TO WHAT'S IMPORTANT HERE: EATING YOGURT. - LOOK AT US GETTING ALONG. BUT I CAN'T HELP FEELING LIKE THERE'S A TIME-SENSITIVE MATTER WE'RE FORGETTING. - KITTY AND MR. SNUGGLETRAP! THEY WOULD REALLY LIKE THIS YOGURT. NOW, WAIT, KITTY LIKES CAKE. NO, WAIT! THEY'RE IN DANGER! NOW THERE'S REALLY NO TIME TO WASTE! - I HATE TO SAY IT, BUT THIS FROYO MACHINE IS REALLY WEIGHING US DOWN. THERE'S ONLY ONE THING TO DO. - HI, WE'D LIKE TO RENT A GOLF CART, PLEASE, ONE WITH A LARGE BACKSEAT FOR OUR FROYO MACHINE. - OKAY, YOU CAN RENT THE PINK CART NOW OR WAIT 20 MINUTES FOR THE BLACK ONE WITH FLAMES ON THE SIDE. both: WE'LL WAIT. - GREAT. I'M STUCK IN A CAVE WITH SNAPTRAP'S STUPID DOLL. - IF YOU WANNA CUDDLE, I'LL SMOTHER YOU WITH A SNUGGLE...AND A PILLOW. - WOW, SOMEONE HAS A LITTLE, BLACK HEART TO MATCH HIS LITTLE, BLACK BUTTON EYES. - ACCORDING TO THIS MAP, THE CAVE IS THREE MILES AWAY, TEN IF WE TAKE A QUICK DETOUR AND GO HORSEBACK RIDING ON THE BEACH. WHAT DO YOU SAY? - NO! WE HAVE TO SAVE OUR FRIENDS. BESIDES, WE ALREADY BURNED A HALF HOUR AT THE HOTEL LUAU. - I SHARED A JAIL CELL WITH A GUY NAMED LOU OW. IF YOU ASKED HIM HOW HE GOT HIS NAME, HE'D SHOW YOU WITH A PAIR OF RUSTY SHEARS. COINCIDENTALLY, I ALSO SHARED A JAIL CELL WITH A GUY NAMED RUSTY SHEARS. - [gasps] - I TAKE IT BY THE LOOK OF HORROR ON YOUR FACE, YOU'VE MET RUSTY. - NO! IT'S THE WEASEL! - AAH! I'M ALLERGIC TO QUICKSAND! WHEN IT GETS INTO MY LUNGS, I'M NO LONGER ALIVE! - I HAVE THAT ALLERGY TOO! [both scream] - WOW! YOU SAVED ME. I'M TOUCHED. - NO, I SAVED THE FROZEN YOGURT MACHINE. YOU JUST HAPPENED TO BE CLINGING TO IT AND WEEPING. - OH, LOOK AT THAT. WE SOILED OUR GRASS SKIRTS OVER A CARDBOARD CUTOUT OF THE WEASEL. THAT CRAFTY MARMOSET. - I'M PRETTY SURE THE WEASEL'S A WEASEL. - OHH! HIS NAME MAKES SENSE TO ME NOW. - LET'S KEEP GOING AND TRY NOT TO FALL FOR ANOTHER WEASEL DECOY. [both scream] both: DEFINITELY THE WEASEL! - [whispers] A TIGER TRAP. GOOD THING OUR CRASH DIDN'T WAKE THEM UP. - WHAT? SPEAK UP! I HAVE YOGURT IN MY EARS! [tigers growling] - FROM EVERYTHING I'VE READ ABOUT TIGERS, WHICH IS NOTHING, WE CAN DISTRACT THEM WITH FROYO. [screams] - OH, NO, YOU DON'T! NOW, HOLD ON. I'M GONNA USE THAT TIGER'S BUTT AS A RAMP TO GET US OUT OF THIS PIT. - FROM NOW ON, WE GOTTA STOP PANICKING WHEN WE SEE THE WEASEL. - YOU'RE RIGHT. WE GOTTA REMEMBER, HE'S JUST A REGULAR GUY IN A LEI, HOLDING A COCONUT DRINK. - HOW DO YOU KNOW HE'S WEARING A LEI AND HOLDING A COCONUT DRINK? - 'CAUSE HE'S RIGHT OVER THERE. [both scream] - WHEW! OH, MAN! YOU GOT US. WE THOUGHT YOU WERE THE WEASEL. - NO, I'M JUST A FOOT DOCTOR ON MY WAY TO A COSTUME PARTY. - SPARE ME YOUR LIFE STORY. WE GOTTA HURRY TO SAVE OUR FRIENDS. WAIT. DID YOU SAY, "COSTUME PARTY"? - AND THE WINNERS OF THE COSTUME CONTEST ARE... THE THREE MUSKETEERS. - YES! WE WON! HEY, BY THE WAY, WHERE'D YOU GET THE MUSKETEER COSTUMES? - FROM THREE UNLUCKY FOOT DOCTORS WHO HAPPENED TO BE IN THE WRONG PLACE AT THE WRONG TIME. - SECOND PLACE GOES TO THE THREE GUYS DRESSED AS HOSTAGES. - SPEAKING OF HOSTAGES, WE SHOULD REALLY SAVE OUR FRIENDS. - WHAT FRIENDS? OH, RIGHT! [crash] WE'RE HERE! HURRY! IT'S HIGH TIDE. - OH, NO. THE TIDE'S COMING IN FAST. - TURN YOUR FROWN UPSIDE DOWN BY LOOTING AN ELECTRONICS STORE. - ON THE BRIGHT SIDE, THE INCOMING TIDE WILL SHORT OUT YOUR VOICE BOX. - KITTY, WE'RE HERE TO RESCUE YOU! - IT'S NO USE, DUDLEY. THE WEASEL RIGGED A BOMB TO A WEIGHTED PLATFORM. IF WE MOVE, THE BOMB WILL EXPLODE. ARE YOU GUYS DRESSED AS MUSKETEERS? - YES! WE WON A COSTUME CONTEST WITH A FROYO MACHINE! - THAT'S IT! THE FROYO MACHINE! IT WEIGHS AS MUCH AS KITTY AND MR. SNUGGLETRAP PUT TOGETHER. WE CAN SWITCH IT WITH THEM AND KEEP THE EXPLOSIVE FROM DETONATING. - OH, THIS IS TERRIBLE. EITHER WAY, I LOSE SOMETHING I LOVE! - [chuckles] YOU LOVE KITTY? DID YOU HEAR THAT, KITTY? I KNOW IT'S SNAPTRAP, BUT IT'S BETTER THAN DYING ALONE. - I'M GONNA DIE ALONE NOW IF YOU DON'T SAVE ME! DUDLEY, YOU SAVED ME! - MR. SNUGGLETRAP, YOU'RE OKAY! [gasps] WHAT'S THIS? A HOLE IN YOUR SNAZZY, TROPICAL ENSEMBLE? THE WEASEL TORE IT. THAT TEARS IT! LET'S GET THAT FIENDISH FERRET! - STILL PRETTY SURE THE WEASEL'S JUST A WEASEL. - OH, RIGHT, RIGHT, RIGHT. WE WENT OVER THIS. - FINALLY, I'M RID OF THOSE MORONS. I WAS GONNA CELEBRATE WITH A LITTLE FROYO, BUT THE MACHINE HAS MYSTERIOUSLY DISAPPEARED. - YOU'RE ABOUT TO MYSTERIOUSLY DISAPPEAR! JUST KIDDING. THESE LOSERS ARE GONNA TAKE YOU TO JAIL. [indistinct shouting] - COME ON. WE'VE GOTTA TAKE HIM BACK TO T.U.F.F. THERE'S NO TIME TO WASTE. - OH, KITTY, IF THERE'S ONE LESSON TO LEARN FROM TODAY IT'S THAT YOGURT GIVES SNAPTRAP TRUMPET BUTT. [flatulence] ALSO, THERE'S ALWAYS TIME TO WASTE. [lively tropical music] ? ? - THE SUN WILL COME OUT TOMORROW... UNLESS I BLOW IT UP. - OKAY, NOW YOU'RE STARTING TO SCARE ME.
