OPUS, LEWIS? GET OUTTA MY SIGHT. IT'S ALL RIGHT. IT'S OKAY. IT'S ALL RIGHT. YOU USE UP ALL THAT FUEL IN THAT SHRUNKEN LITTLE STOMACH OF YOURS BEFORE WE GET TO THE SHIP-- AND THEN YOU POOP OUT ON ME BEFORE WE GET BACK. ALWAYS GIVE ME SOMETHING, OKAY? I HOPE ALLAH ISN'T TOO ANGRY WITH ME. IT HAS BEEN ABSOLUTELY IMPOSSIBLE TO FIND THE TIME TO PRAY. THANKS FOR LAST NIGHT. GET YOUR BUTTS OUT OF THE SURF ZONE, SIRS! Both: HOOYAH! HOOYAH. OLSON, PREPARE TO GET UNDERWAY. AYE, AYE, CAPTAIN. MR. DEL PISO, MR. RAHMAN-- TIME TO DO IT AGAIN. BUT, MASTER CHIEF, THE SHIP'S SCHEDULED TO MAKE WAY. SON OF A BITCH! ARE YOU REFUSING TO FOLLOW MY INSTRUCTIONS, MR. DEL PISO? NO, BUT, MASTER CHIEF... THEN MOVE OUT! WITH ALL DUE RESPECT, MASTER CHIEF... GET YOUR ASS IN THE WATER OR RING OUT NOW! CHOOSE! HOOYAH. TAGS OFF. ALL HEAD, ONE QUARTER, SIR. NO! > EMERGENCY-- STOP ENGINES. WE STILL HAVE MEN IN THE WATER! MOVE OUT! STOP ALL ENGINES. WHAT IS THIS? WHAT IS THIS? WHAT IS THIS? A SEAL NEVER CUTS HIS BUDDY LINE. NEVER! REPORT TO SICK BAY. YOU CAN BOTH RING OUT IN THE MORNING. LET'S GET OUTTA HERE, EDDIE. HI, LOU. HEY, STRANGER. I'M SORRY I HAVEN'T CALLED YOU. JUST NEEDED SOME TIME ALONE. I'VE BEEN ON HIATUS MYSELF. ASIDE FROM CUTTING YOUR HAIR, HOW ARE THINGS? OKAY. YEAH? YEAH, I LIKE MY LITTLE APARTMENT. I'VE BEEN GETTING QUITE A BIT OF WRITING DONE. GOOD FOR YOU. THERE WAS AN ACCIDENT TODAY. DEL PISO? YEAH. APPARENTLY, HE CUT HIS BUDDY LINE TO SAVE HIMSELF. HE RINGS OUT TOMORROW MORNING. DON'T QUIT. DON'T QUIT. All: DON'T QUIT. DON'T QUIT. DON'T QUIT. DON'T QUIT. DON'T QUIT. DON'T QUIT. CAPTAIN HUGHES, SIR. WHAT HAPPENED WASN'T OUR FAULT. MASTER CHIEF GUTIERREZ INTENTIONALLY SENT US OUT TOO LATE. TAGS CAME OFF AT 1200 HOURS, SIR. I SENT THEM OUT AT 1130. WE DIDN'T TAKE 30 MINUTES, SIR. WE TOOK UNDER 15. DO YOU HAVE ANY WAY OF PROVING THIS? NO, SIR. THEN THERE'S THE MATTER OF THIS BUDDY LINE. HE DIDN'T CUT IT, SIR. I DID. AND THEN HE RISKED HIS LIFE TO SAVE MINE. CAPTAIN HUGHES, SIR. MR. RAHMAN AND MR. DEL PISO ARE TELLING THE TRUTH AND I CAN PROVE IT. I HEARD THE SHIP'S BELL TOLL AT THE TIME THEY WERE SENT OUT-- 1200 HOURS. IT MUST'VE BEEN DIRECTLY UNDER THE SHIP WHEN SHE GOT UNDER WAY. CONSIDER THIS MATTER UNDER INVESTIGATION. CARRY ON, GENTLEMEN. CAPTAIN. A LEADER IS ACCOUNTABLE FOR THE ACTIONS OF HIS MEN. THESE MEN ACTED ACCORDING TO MY ORDERS. MY ERROR IN JUDGMENT PLACED THEIR LIVES IN JEOPARDY, AND I TAKE FULL RESPONSIBILITY. MASTER CHIEF GUTIERREZ, UNTIL THIS MATTER IS RESOLVED, YOU'LL BE RELIEVED OF YOUR DUTIES. SIR. BRIAN, THE GRADUATION'S ABOUT TO START. CAN'T DO IT, RAHMAN. AT LAST, YOU SHOW FEAR. YOU HAVE NO FEAR OF DEATH. YOUR TRAGEDY IS YOU FEAR LIFE. YOUR PAIN IS SELF-CHOSEN. DESTINY IS NOT A MATTER OF CHANCE. IT'S A MATTER OF CHOICE. IT'S NOT A THING TO BE WAITED FOR. IT'S A THING TO BE PURSUED. YOU ARE THE MASTER OF YOUR FATE, BRIAN. THE CAPTAIN OF YOUR SOUL. BEFORE I READ THE NAMES OF OUR GRADUATING CLASS, YOUR CLASS LEADER HAS SOMETHING HE WANTS TO SAY TO YOU. CLASS 195, SINCE THAT DAY A MONTH AGO WHEN YOU STOOD UP FOR MR. RAHMAN AND ME, I'VE BEEN DOING A LOT OF THINKING. EACH OF YOU CAME HERE FOR DIFFERENT REASONS, DRIVEN BY SOMETHING DEEP INSIDE YOU, AIMED AT MAKING YOU A BETTER PERSON. YOU'RE HERE TODAY WITH SO MUCH TO BE PROUD OF. I WISH I COULD SHARE THAT PRIDE. BUT I'M ASHAMED TO ADMIT THAT THE QUALITIES THAT DROVE YOU ON TO SUCCESS IN THIS COURSE WERE NOT THE QUALITIES THAT DROVE ME. YOURS SPRING FROM A SENSE OF DUTY, TEAMWORK, AND SACRIFICE. YOU KNEW THE DANGER COMING IN, AND YOU USED IT TO BRING OUT THE BEST IN YOURSELVES. I CAME HERE TO USE THE DANGER AGAINST MYSELF. I PLACE NO VALUE ON MY LIFE. UNTIL I LEARN THAT VALUE, I CANNOT-- AND WILL NOT ASSUME THE RESPONSIBILITY OF BEING YOUR LEADER. AS I READ YOUR NAMES, YOU MAY STEP FORWARD AND ACCEPT YOUR DIPLOMA AND DO WHAT YOU HAVE FEARED DOING FOR THE PAST SIX MONTHS-- RING THAT BELL. STARTING WITH CLASS LEADER ENSIGN CHARLES BROMWELL III. DO WE HAVE ANY BREAD LEFT? YEP. YEAH, A BIT. ALL RIGHT, HERE THEY COME. SEE IF WE CAN GET 'EM TO LAND. COME ON, COME ON. I DON'T THINK THEY'RE GONNA DO IT. YEAH? YEAH. YOU KEEP FEEDING 'EM. I'LL BE RIGHT BACK, OKAY? OKAY. I THOUGHT GRADUATION WAS TODAY. IT WAS. YOU DIDN'T GRADUATE? NOPE. WELL, THAT TOOK COURAGE. MM-HMM. I HEAR YOU MOVED OUT. YEAH. HOW ABOUT THAT? THAT TOOK COURAGE. SO... WHAT ARE YOUR PLANS? I DON'T KNOW. I... I WANNA BE WITH YOU. I LOVE YOU, MICHELLE. I LOVE YOU, TOO.
