Simon's here. Hi there. Pull it in. Wow! What a cool car, Mom! - Do I get a moped when I'm 18? - If you study like your sister. - Yeah right! - Don't wake her up! - Let's hurry. - She's gonna flip out. Take the other side. Don't scratch it. She's gonna love it. Now that's a present! - You're OK with 8 payments? - Sure thing, Cathy. Here are the keys. - You think of everything. - Always. - Coming to the party, Simon? - I don't want to intrude. Don't be silly. Let me drive you back. What's with the mess, Eva? You promised you'd clean up. You hear me, Eva? Time to get up. - You've reached Eva's voicemail. - Happy birthday, honey. Where are you? I'm off to the hairdresser's. Don't be late. Your dad will be here at noon. Love you, sweetie. COLD-BLOODED MURDER SEPTEMBER 24 - Jennifer? - Hi, Mrs. Chartier. - I like your hair. - Thanks. Where's Eva? No idea. - She didn't sleep over? - No. Didn't you go out last night? - Yeah, but she left early. - With whom? - I wasn't paying attention. - Maybe that's her. Hello? No, I'm not home. I don't know where she is. Wait in the car. I'll be there in 10 minutes! Richard hasn't changed a bit. - See you later. - See you. Let's go. Your hair looks nice. This is Fabienne's daughter, Charline. - Hello. - Hello. - She knows Eva. - No need to explain. - Where's Laurent? - Likely skateboarding. Look at this. I went a little crazy too. It's pistachio, her favorite. How pretty. Put these on top. She's too young for a car. And it's not the best time. Don't start. She earned it. She got into med school. I'd have given it to her as soon as she passed her exams. - Laurent has to redo the year. - You're tough on them. That's why Eva's done so well. I'll stay on Laurent's case. The real estate agent said you want to be here for visits. Yes, we agreed to sell it by Eva's 20th birthday. - I can't help it. - Nothing's happened in 6 months. - You think that's my fault? - Stop it. We need to sell the house. It's too much with the bakery and Eva's apartment in Paris. Got it? Eva, your dad's here. You're the one who invited him. - Get yourself home! - Give her some breathing room. Like you did when you left me to raise our 2 kids? Think I can have them since Eva's quitting skating? Ask her. - I bet she planned this. - What? Being late so my parents would talk. It worked. - Hurry up. - We're coming. - It's not a funeral, Eric. - He got home really late. - So, where's the big present? - Hidden in the garage. - Is everyone here? - Everyone except Eva. - He's here? - It was Eva's choice. - I'm trying to stay calm. - I can tell. Hence the long face. Did he come with his...? He wouldn't go that far. Where is she? I'm worried. - Maybe she's avoiding me. - Why's that? - He's her ex-boyfriend. - Oh yeah? Divorce sucks because you see one more than the other. Let's hang out sometime. I'd like to, but you know how close those two are. I'm happy to be here. I should have you look at my scooter. My parents won't buy me a car. - Did you hurt yourself on it? - No... Will you watch those for a minute? Cathy! Relax, Cathy. You look like a watchdog. She'll be here soon. Like right now. - This isn't like Eva. - What can we do? - What happened, honey? - She got a nosebleed. - Does she get them often? - Never. - Get some ice. - Lie down. No, she should bend over. Here's a tissue. - Hurry up, Laurent! - Stay bent over. It'll be OK. Karim, have you seen Eva? No, her party went late last night. Where could she be? - St. Georges Hospital. - Did a girl come in last night? No, ma'am. Are you sure there weren't any accidents? - Let me check. - I have another call. - Where are you? - Is she there? - No. What're you doing? - Looking for our daughter. I hope your darling is OK. Please excuse us. One of the girls had a baby. My daughter's been missing since last night. How old is she? - Today's her 20th birthday. - This is what awaits you! That's not unusual for a 20-year-old. Right. But it's not like her to disappear like this. Every parent says the same thing. She's likely already home. Where? Stay there, we're on our way. Someone found a body on his farm. - Go home, ma'am. - What's going on? My colleague will help you. Patrick! Cathy? Dan, can you take over? I need to go. - What's going on? - It's Cathy. She followed the cops to a farm for some reason. I'll be right back. This is one memorable party. Eva's likely avoiding her dad. It was her idea to invite him. Girls change their minds all the time. No, we don't. - You're reached Eva's voicemail. - Where are you? Everyone's waiting for you. What's going on? What is it? Who is it? Is that my daughter? Did she have an accident? Let me see her! - Calm down, ma'am. - What's going on here? It's OK, I'll handle it. See how worked up you are? What are we doing here? That's clearly not our daughter. That's not our daughter! Stay here. OK. Bye. That was Fabienne. She'll pick up Charline. We don't know for sure yet. I'm Lieutenant Morand. I'm heading the investigation. Will you follow me? - What the hell is this? - Please calm down. There wasn't a purse, ID or cell phone at the scene. Can you tell me if your daughter was wearing these clothes? Will you look, please? - I want to see her. - I don't advise it. What do you mean? She's my daughter. I have a right to see her. - Please, sir... - What? What happened to her? Her face was severely beaten. Are you alright, ma'am? Let me help. Cathy! Did your daughter have any problems? - Any enemies? - Everyone liked her. - What about a boyfriend? - No. Eric Favre, but they broke up a few months ago. Is he a violent guy? No, not at all. He's the son of my ex-neighbor, still neighbors with my ex-wife. - Was she beaten? - Yes. Was she... ...raped? It doesn't appear so, but it's too early to say. We're about to do an autopsy. You'll... You'll find this guy? - I'll do my best. - You swear? I can't do that, Mr. Chartier, but I promise to do my best. Let us do our job. And don't talk to the press. We don't want to leak her name. I got it. This is her. Do you plan to compete professionally? I'm starting med school, so I won't be competing anymore. My dream is to be a doctor. But I'm proud to have won this cup. Hi, Mom and Laurent! I promised my brother I'd say hi on TV if I won. I sent everyone home, like you asked. Laurent is at our house. He doesn't know anything. Are you alright, Cathy? Maybe she should've stayed there. She didn't want to. The police did that. They came by an hour ago. They said they needed to seal off access to her room. No one's allowed in there now. It's procedure. They said they'd come back tomorrow to take it off. Sorry, this is too much. Sorry. DO NOT ENTER We have to tell Laurent. - Let's wait until tomorrow. - What's the point? He must be wondering what's going on. We can't leave him in the dark. Why should he suffer tonight? His sister is dead and we don't know why. Do you think he's better off knowing? His life will be as ruined as ours. - Can't it wait until tomorrow? - Whatever you want. She wouldn't be dead if you'd let her have the car sooner. We'll take justice into our own hands. The bastard who did this doesn't deserve to live. MURDERED Are you home, Mrs. Chartier? SEPTEMBER 25 Mrs. Chartier, have you listened to the radio? Your daughter's name was leaked to the press. They found this in the hospital bathroom. The reporters are on it. They've intercepted our CBs. They're vultures. Marie, is Laurent there? Yes. Hold on. Just a second. ...a body found in a sewage pipe belongs to Eva Chartier, 20 years old. - A reporter identified her... - What? Laurent! It's illegal to publish photos of minors. Stay back. - Why didn't you tell me? - I didn't want this. Then why not tell me? - Laurent! - Leave me alone! Mrs. Chartier, did you break the police seal? That could hinder our investigation. You must leave the room intact. Two days after Eva Chartier's murder, a suspect has been apprehended. The individual has a criminal record. SEPTEMBER 26 Mr. Chartier... They're still out there. Look at those vultures. Look at those vultures. I've been calling. Why won't your mom pick up? All she does is cry and sleep. She won't talk to anyone. I'm not just anyone. The police have a suspect. Did they call you? Me neither. It's crazy. You need to get up. You can't stay in bed. I don't want to. I can't. I yelled at her before she went out that night. My last words to her were: "Clean your damn room!" Those were the words in her head when she left. Remember... ...the pamphlet on grieving they gave us? - Have you read it? - No. It says... We should focus on what we have left. Easy for you to say. You have a wife and stepdaughter, a family. - Who is he? - An oddball. He lives near the crime scene. We found Eva's bike behind his trailer. It's disrespectful not to have told us. It's respectful not to share every detail. Reporters always beat us to the punch. True, he looks suspicious. He has a history of assault... Yes? I'll be right back. I wanna see this guy. So you looked at the photos? That's the autopsy report. Sorry, but you can't have it. Eva wasn't raped. - We believe she died quickly. - How? We've identified the weapon. It was a rock. That's more than I should say. We have the right to know, don't we? - Legally, no. - What? It's up to the examining judge. Don't give them anything. They want you to crack. That's for my son. She deserved it. Vultures! Let me talk to the judge. This is it. Wait here. - Hello. - Over there. Hello, ma'am. - We'd like to see Judge Lalanne. - Do you have an appointment? No. Just a second. I'm the father of Eva Chartier, the girl who was murdered. The police told us Judge Lalanne was handling the case. Have you filed a civil suit? - A civil suit? - You need to file one. - We've been left in the dark. - You're indirect victims. You have to submit your lawsuit to the examining judge. We'd like to do that, then. - After you file the suit. - Hold on a second. There's a guy behind that door who may have killed my daughter, and they don't have 5 minutes for me? We have a right to know what's going on. We understand your grief, but getting upset won't help. This is for a civil suit. Your lawyer will know the procedure. - We don't have a lawyer. - I suggest you get one. Here's a list of lawyers specialized in the field. We have to hire a lawyer and file a civil suit just to see the damn judge. Here's our civil suit. Can we have an appointment? Judge Lalanne will see you if he deems it necessary. What? - How do we know he'll see us? - We barely know how she died. Or even when we can bury her. When can we see the case file? Legally, it can take up to 6 months. - You can request it be 4 months. - We'd like to do that, then. Fine, who is your lawyer? I'll try to get an appointment with Lalanne, I know him. But the priority is to get a burial certificate. - And to find out what happened. - Excuse me. That's for the state prosecutor. That's for the expert. Where were we? You'll need to be patient. The investigation has just begun. I'll call you when I have news. - You haven't told us your fees. - I won't charge you. I understand you've had a hard time since your divorce. This will be a pro bono case. Thank you. Don't worry about the compensation. Pardon? Crime victims receive compensation. After the trial, you'll go before the compensation board. - Compensation for what? - For losing your daughter. The State owes you as parents of a crime victim. - What? - I know, it's a delicate issue. - Eva's death has a price tag? - That's the law. SEPTEMBER 29 - You don't recognize me? - No. I'm Aunt Sophie, your mom's sister. The last time I saw you was your grandmother's funeral. You were only 5. Your mom won't want to see me, but I don't care. I don't just dance at work. I make cocktails too. Try this, it's a stiff one. It'll take your mind off things. You drove from Paris to make me drinks? I know we've been fighting for years. I don't know what it's like to lose a child. - Still... - I didn't lose my daughter. She's getting butchered on a fucking table. You don't "lose" a child! What's this? Her birthday present. Let's go. This isn't gonna help. You're only hurting yourself. Eva always got in bed with us during storms. She'd ask me to protect her. Richard didn't like it, but I didn't care. You think you'll always be there to protect your kids. It's not true. It only takes one time. She was wearing the necklace that night! There's no point looking here. We haven't found the necklace. Or her purse and cell phone? We know she called a hospital in Paris around 12:30 AM. - Do you know why? - No idea. Did she mention any problems with her father? What? What were you doing on Saturday night? - I got home very late. - What time? Around 3 AM. I went to the game with friends and we partied afterwards. - Where? - At a bar nearby. It was called Marinette's. - What'd you do afterwards? - I went home. I stopped on the way and napped in my car. I'd been drinking. - Can anyone back up your story? - Any of my friends. Were you and Eva close? Did she confide in you? Of course. What about your ex-husband? Why do you keep bringing him up? What'd your suspect say? - He was cleared. - What? Your daughter died at 2:30 AM. He was at the soup kitchen. It wasn't him. Why'd he have Eva's bike? He found it in a field and took it home. Why all the questions? Am I a suspect? Do you remember Ms. Delamare? Hang on a second. - You don't think... - It's merely a question. Do you know her? Did your ex-husband ever try anything with your daughter? Sexually, I mean. Yes, I know her. She accused you of attempted rape. That girl lied. She was an intern at the bakery. I wanted to fire her for incompetence, so she made up the sexual assault. It was 3 years ago and the case was dismissed! - She never changed her story. - This is unreal. My daughter was murdered and you suspect me? Sit down, Mr. Chartier. Hello, Mr. Chartier. Your wife called me. They treated me like a killer. It was because of the complaint. - They must've harassed Cathy. - They did. It's understandable. They even brought Eric in. Call me if it happens again. I could've helped. As if we haven't suffered enough! Are they gonna call everyone I know? They'll think I'm the prime suspect. Don't think about that. You'll need to wait to sell the house. While it's sealed, it belongs to the courts. We can't sell it anymore? - No. - Shit. We're the victims, but we're being punished. I'll see you soon, Mr. Chartier. I really wish I could help. As a branch, we don't have much power. What about a personal loan in the meantime? Not with your current income. I have a business and my ex-wife has a job. We've never missed a mortgage payment. The bank will seize the house if you don't find a solution. My daughter is dead. She was murdered. Our lives have been shattered! What will it take for you to cut us some slack? Let me talk to the manager. Do you even care? If you'd tried a little harder to sell the house, we wouldn't be in this mess. We could've done a lot of things differently. What do you mean? Go ahead. Tell me what I did wrong. You've avoided me since I was questioned. You won't look me in the eye. Look at me, Cathy. Look at me! Do you think I'm capable of hurting my own child? How long has it been since you looked at me? You didn't want to see my love and trust in you. I've never believed for a second that you could hurt your daughter. We got the burial certificate this morning, and you forced me to come here. I can't stay any longer. - You can't go out in that. - Come on, Mom. - Want to try it on? - You really should. No way. I'd look ridiculous. - You'd look hot. Right? - Absolutely. - It'll be fun. - No time. Go change, now. - But I love this dress. - No! Unbelievable. I passed my exams. Let me have some fun. - This one? - It was her favorite. She should wear it, then. Your sister looks beautiful. - Come see her. - No. It'll be the last time you'll see her. I don't want to. - Come on. - No! Don't force him to do it. Wanna go for a walk? Everything will be ready tomorrow. We found this key in the pocket of her dress. Why'd you tell the police that Eva had changed? They suspected it was someone close, so I thought about it, and I felt like she'd changed. You didn't? How could you know? You hadn't seen her since August. You were on vacation with your family. When I got back, she seemed different. I would've known if something was wrong. When she was younger, maybe, back when she'd tell us all about school, her crushes, her life. When I met her for lunch that day... She'd become a young woman. - I'd be the first to know. - How could you have noticed? You were obsessed with her schoolwork. - It's all you saw. - What about you? Maybe she changed when you left us for that woman. Stop mixing everything up. I don't want Fabienne near me at the funeral. Hi, Fabienne. It's me. I won't be home for dinner. I have to settle some details for the funeral. OCTOBER 8 Eric asked if he could be a pallbearer. Why not? What are they doing here? - They're filming the funeral. - What? They have no respect. Why didn't you tell me? You never change. You always make decisions without me. I thought you'd agree for Eva's sake. They think... They think the murderer might show up. OK. OCTOBER 12 She looked younger on TV. She had piles of makeup on. - She didn't waste any time. - Quiet, she's coming. - %42.50. - Will you pay her? - She seems OK. - She's practically smiling. I'm getting chills up my spine. Thanks. Are you alright, Cathy? People think losing a child is contagious. - Go home early. - That'd prove them right. Plus, I need the money. - We can't sell the house. - Why not? The judge won't let us. I don't mind taking the car back. I'm not ready yet. It was for her. It's still hers. Cathy... There are no words. Thanks, Karim. What were the police doing here? They just asked me some questions. Again? Do they have a lead? Stop grilling me, Cathy. - They don't tell me anything. - Want to get me in trouble? I feel for you, but I can't lose my license. - One of my waiters called them. - Did he know something? That night, he went to his car to get his cell phone. He saw Eva behind the bar. - And? - She was having an argument. - With whom? - Her ex-boyfriend. Eric? He'd been waiting for her outside. Thanks, Karim. - Hi, Cathy. - Hi. - Need something? - No. How'd it go with the cops? - Fine. - What'd they ask you? Why Eva and I broke up. And whether I knew anything about the night she died. And? Nothing in particular. Why? I'll go home tomorrow. It's time. It's good to be near the sea. Simon's nice. This was a good idea. - Think he likes you? - Simon? Are you kidding? You cracked a smile! That's a good start. You're allowed to feel happy. - I don't think so. - Don't obsess over Eric. What if it's not him? I'll be better when I find out who killed Eva and why. What if you never know? Have you thought of that? I know Eric did it. Copy that. Look! The cops are taking Eric in. What'd he do? They searched the house, and now they're taking him in. He's never hurt anyone! He loved Eva! Cathy... Oh, no. I never thought you'd... He's my son, Cathy! There's a new development in Eva Chartier's case: Police have arrested a suspect, a close friend of the victim. The victim's family declined to comment. He's a suspect, but hasn't been charged. Why not? Investigations take time... Bastard! I never suspected him. Did you, Mom? It's too soon to disclose anything. Were there traces of his blood on the victim's shirt? I can't say anything more. Have there been similar crimes recently? No, this is the first one of its kind. That will be all. OCTOBER 17 - Hurry up, Laurent! - Coming! Hi, Mom. This can't be happening! Mom! They released Eric without telling us. Are you surprised? His blood was on Eva's shirt. Isn't that proof? The lawyer said there were other tests. The waiter saw Eric arguing with Eva that night. - What more does the judge need? - Let him do his job! We don't have all the facts. - We're not detectives. - That's the best you've got? Please stop, Cathy. Could you watch Eva's killer calmly come home every night? Right in front of your window? I can't. Enjoy your day with your family, Richard. Cathy... Cathy! Richard... - Let go! - You need to leave the premises. Let go! Wait up, Mrs. Chartier. You need to stop this. You're making things worse. Sorry I never called you back. We don't need the apartment. You must've heard about my daughter. No? What's that about the rent? I'm coming. You're fired. You've reached my voicemail. You know the drill. - Hello. - Sorry, I don't read the papers. I'm confused. She rented it this summer with a man. There must be a mistake. We saw it in May to rent it in September. - That wasn't my daughter. - No need to yell. I'm not crazy. I know it was the same girl who came with you in May. Which key is it? Hold on. So you had a key too? - How much are the utilities? - At least %300 a month. - That's pretty high. - Yes. - That's pretty high. - Yes. The windows are outdated. You'll need to replace them. - Really? - I'm going. Why don't you go upstairs? Where are you going? I told you, out of town with Jennifer. - Where'll you stay? - At her aunt's. I'm almost 20. Stop treating me like I'm 15. You've been mad ever since Dad left you. Eva! Sorry. Oh, Mom. I just want you to be happy. I love you. I don't want to argue. Just trust me, OK? Fine. Why didn't you tell me? Eva made me swear not to tell. I was ashamed about lying. Did you think I'd be mad at this stage? - How'd she get the apartment? - Her boyfriend paid for it. What boyfriend? - I never met him. - Why not? Because he was married. He wanted to keep it secret. You tell me this now? He loved her too much to kill her. You think so? Plenty of devoted men kill their wives! - He'd never do that. - How can you be sure? Laurent? Are you home? - I was scared. - Scared? - Richard! - What? - What's this? - You wanted me to do something. I never asked for this. - Tell her the truth. - Richard! Tell her! - Where'd you get that? - His dad. - Stop it. - You're gonna talk, bastard! I told her I still loved her. She said it was over, that I needed to let her go. - She was meeting her boyfriend. - Her boyfriend? He's telling the truth. What about the blood and the scratches on his hand? I punched the wall next to her. I hurt myself and got blood on her shirt. I didn't kill her, I swear. I loved Eva. He's not lying. She was seeing someone else. They gave him a sedative. - Can I see him? - No, he's in bad enough shape. Wait, Fabienne. You're not the only one in pain. I found him rolled into a ball one day. - I thought... - He tries to look strong. He told me he wanted to be strong for Eva's mother. He could go to prison for this. Just because he wanted to prove... - Hello. - Hello. I'm Fabrice. Thanks for agreeing to see me. Tell me everything. Eva and I met on campus when she came to register. It was love at first sight. - You were married? - Yes, for a year. - She never told me. - She knew you wouldn't approve. An older, married man... I was all wrong. - What about your wife? - I left her a week earlier. What happened that night? Eva called me at the hospital. She was very upset. It was before my shift, so I went to see her. She waited for me outside the bar. She'd argued with her ex-boyfriend. Yes, Eric. Why'd she want to see you? - She was scared. - Scared of what? Hi, Mom and Dad. Thanks for the gift. I wanted you both here because I also have a surprise for you on this special day. That won't work. Mom and Dad, please don't yell at me, but... That's worse. Be natural and speak from your heart. I've met Fabrice. He's the love of my life and we're having a baby. We just found out, but I've decided to keep it. I hope you're as happy as I am today. I know what you're thinking and I'm scared too. But I think I can handle it. I'll balance motherhood and school. You had me young, but you finished school, Mom. How old were you when you had me? - I was 19. Why? - No reason. Make the most of life. Don't marry too young, like me. - Even if you're in love? - Love is fleeting. For 6 months, it's all passion. Just look at your dad. You're such a cynic. You know, good guys leave their wives too. Eric decided not to press charges. Your ex-husband is lucky, even if there's legal action. - You were right to keep me. - Thanks. You shouldn't read the newspaper. - And Richard? - He's going to a rest home. - Can I visit him? - Not until Christmas, at least. - This is for you. - What is it? The judge's strong recommendation. Here, read it. The silence at home is the hardest part. I expect to hear the lock turn and the door open. Cathy? Will you share why you're here today? Me? Everyone here knows what it's like. My pain is my business. Judge Lalanne forced me to come. If you think... What? Tell us. I just want to find the killer. I have to start over, and review the evidence. This is a waste of time. Please stay, Cathy. The killer isn't in these photos, but he was connected to your daughter. It was someone she knew. You don't believe me, do you? - Not really. - The why'd you call? - I'm desperate. - How's the case going? It isn't going anywhere. They've assigned it to a new judge. That means it could take years. - How much do I owe you? - Nothing. You wouldn't believe how many parents like you I see. You give off a negative energy. Obviously. It distances you from your loved ones. - I can help you with that. - No, thanks. NOVEMBER 23 Fabienne, how's Richard? I haven't heard from him. He's still in the home. You don't have to. It's in case someone saw her that night. - I'll pass them out at work. - Thanks. Did he get my letters? Richard is in no condition to read. He's obsessed with finding the killer, like you. - Can I talk to you? - Want to spit at me again? What do you want from me, a public apology? What do you want from me, a public apology? I was just doing my job, dammit. I'm not here to lecture you. It's been 3 months and the cops are at a dead end. I need to find witnesses and revive the investigation. You owe me. Richard is suffering, as are my son and me. I don't know who else to turn to. You're unbelievable, Cathy. I'll make up the days I missed. That's not how it works. Simon, I need this job. Sorry, I have no choice. It's not fair to everybody else. I just can't, Cathy. Hi, it's Clara. I'm not going to be able to write the article you wanted. My editor says the story is over and our readers have moved on. I'm very sorry, Mrs. Chartier. DECEMBER 20 Hey, sis! You don't seem well. - Christmas is just 5 days away. - I know. I won't let you two celebrate alone. Hi, sweetie. You're gonna be a heartbreaker. - How long are you staying? - As long as I can. Oh, my. - What's all this? - Leave it, Sophie. It's Christmas, time to forget our worries. - Stop it. - We're all going to Euro Disney. Then the two of us will see the Chippendales. What do you say? Leave these alone. Screw the Chippendales! I didn't ask you to come. Sophie! Sophie! I'm sorry. I know you wanted to cheer me up. I can't pretend it's a normal Christmas. - What? - It's Latin. Roughly, it means life is here and now. Drink a toast to "hic," and I don't know what you do about "nunc." Maybe go out for Chinese. Bye, sis. Happy? Plan on memorizing Eva's files? You keep reliving the horror. It's pointless! Merry Christmas! - Sorry. - It's fine. Here. You can spill it on whomever you like. Thanks. It's chilly out here. I can't do this. Don't go. Are you alright? No. Why not? Hold me in your arms. DECEMBER 27 Hello? The case hasn't gone anywhere. You've got nothing. The best you can do is arrest my son? What'd he do? He was caught stealing %1,000 worth of merchandise. - So what? - This is serious. I don't care. I know you're grieving, but it doesn't give you a free pass. Your son is in a dangerous place. - Ask yourself why he did this. - Can I take him home now? He's asked to live with his step-mother. No... Laurent would never do that. Social services thinks it would be best, as well. It may not be obvious, but I love you. It hasn't been obvious since Eva died. No one else exists. Do you really think I love you less than Eva? - I'll spend more time with you. - When? - When? - I don't know. It's not up to me. It's up to the judge and the police. I'm trying to help, which is why I have less time. I'd rather live with Dad, then. Your father isn't home yet. He isn't well. I'll live with Aunt Sophie, then. You can't, she lives in Paris. I'll move into the dorms, then. Look at me, Laurent. Look at me. Tell me what you want, and we'll do it. Right now? Yes, right now. I promise. Ready? How are you doing, Richard? It's still killing me. Well... I don't know if I'm coming or going half the time. - What about you? - I tossed all the files. It was tough at first, but I'm letting go. I've lost hope of ever finding her killer. I haven't. I know. It's been almost a year. I wish I could've protected her. I'm glad you have Fabienne and Charline. My daughter, Eva, was murdered. I felt like I'd died with her. It's true, a part of me died. Nothing will ever be the same, nothing. But I'm more than the mother of a murdered daughter. I'm Cathy, age 42, and I have a son, Laurent, whom I love, and he needs me. What would Eva want? Do you want to think about it? No need. You seem honest. It'll be great for touring the countryside. - Thanks. Here. - Want to keep the key chain? - You can have it. - Thanks. - You no longer live here? - No. - So your house is for sale? - No, we can't sell it right now. Too bad, I'd be interested. It seems perfect for a family. It is. - Goodbye. - Goodbye. - Is there a problem? - No. When I adjusted the seat, I found this underneath. It must be yours. Goodbye. Simon Guetal's garage was raided by police today. They found Eva Chartier's purse, half-burnt, in the boiler room. Has he explained himself? He was test-driving the car when he saw Eva. She was alone and her bike had a flat tire. He offered her a ride. He made inappropriate advances. Eva got scared and jumped out of the car. He grabbed her to calm her down, he became enraged, and he killed her with a rock. It's a relief for the parents... Yeah, right. This is the worst part. Why, dammit? Why? Cathy never got an answer. Simon killed himself 5 days after going to prison. Cathy and Laurent moved to Paris. She works for a victims' association and is studying law. She's gradually seeing past the pain. It's still hard, but she's getting there. It took Richard some time to feel entitled to happiness. It kicked in when he went back to work. He'd forgotten that making bread was his calling. I helped Cathy put her experience into words. She goes to conferences and support group meetings. She wants to give her pain meaning. She holds a ceremony on the anniversary of Eva's death. She doesn't want to forget. For a brief moment, this tragic spot is almost cheerful. FOR THE ASSOCIATION OF PARENTS OF VICTIMS (APEV) Translation: ?pilogue
