(Even if we're apart, we're close at heart) (Let's abide) (Social distance) Social distance. When was the first time I heard this term? By keeping a distance, you protect yourself. This should work both physically and psychologically. But... Jun-kun! High school students are oblivious to this. My childhood friend Ryohei in particular has no sense of distance. Find the speed of the small object b at the instant it passes point C. Assuming friction is zero. "Assuming friction is zero" is everywhere in school. "He did that, that's why he's this kind of guy." By assuming this, they simplify the world. Mana's friend wants us to introduce guys to her. - Really? - You did it! To high school boys, sex is not a reproductive act. It's a social activity to elevate their own status. In that respect, Ono is the king of this class. Ando, do you have a girlfriend? What? No... Then, what do you think of this girl? Oh? I... prefer this one. - Jun-kun! - That's my girlfriend! I feel you! I feel you though. I feel like I've been forced to attend some dubious religious gathering. It would be easier if they could just brainwash and convert me. But it's not possible, so I keep my distance so that nobody finds out. (I think I'll finish work early today) 35 minutes by train. This distance allows me to be who I truly am. At this moment, the distance between me and her is 0.1 mm. Anyway, what movie was it again? The movie that Makoto-san said he likes. I'm sorry. If it were 0 mm, tragedy will happen. (Sensei, will you take my virginity?) If it were 0 mm, tragedy will happen. If I'm not wrong, she is... (Art Club) (Miura Sae) Miura...san? Ando-kun... At this moment, the distance between me and him is 0.01 mm. This distance protects both of us. This is fantasy. It's his first time but it went in so easily. Jun, it wasn't easy for you, huh. Stop it! Hey. Next time, try attacking me like this. No way. Try pushing me down sometimes. You may like it. Hey. Try saying this. No way. I will never say it. What the hell... What kind of girl owns this book? No idea. But you said she's from your class. I hardly ever spoke to her. She seems to be the kind who doesn't have worries. I don't know what he's thinking. The kind who would stab someone with a straight face? He said he would keep it a secret, but he took the new volume as hostage. What should I do, Big sis? How worrying. Sharing secrets bring people closer. What the hell is that? She may get close to you very quickly. It's not possible. Because... What she likes... are homos, not me. (Translation & timing by Mich) Good morning. (Translation & timing by Mich) (Translation & timing by Mich) Jun-kun! Morning! - You stink of sweat. - No way. - I wiped properly. - You guys are really close, huh. Oh yes, Imamiya. Coach told you to see him during lunch. He wants to talk about the training plan. How troublesome! Hey, Miura-san, you're from Arts club, right? Yeah. I'm very good at drawing para para manga. Wanna have a showdown with me? What? Why? I don't want. - Eh... You don't want? - Of course she wouldn't want. Why? Please, have a showdown once with me! Please, please. I'm really good at it. Have you drawn one before? I'm really good at it. - No way. - I can make it move like this. - You must be lying. - It's awesome if I can do it, right? Right? So let's have a showdown once. You haven't told anyone, right? What? I said, you haven't told anyone, right? Yeah. Ando-kun, you smoke? No, I don't. My family does, so the smell might have got on it. Eh... it smells that bad? No. My heart was in my mouth the entire day. I'm relieved now. "So Miura bought such things." "So Miura is a fujoshi". I thought they'd say that about me. I won't do such a childish thing. I borrowed it only because I wanted to see what you're reading. But you're close to Ono-kun. Don't lump us together. Ryohei is close to Ono, so we talk sometimes, that's all. When I was in middle school, I lost all my friends. The so-called leader of the girls found out I was a fujoshi and said "disgusting". Just three syllables. "DIS-GUS-TING" And that was the end of my middle school life. A word of destruction. I thought you said that no girls hate homos? All girls love such things... All? Well, maybe not all girls... but no girls hate them.... It's really not what you think. There are tons of girls out there who don't like homo-loving girls! The... the one having the strawberry sauce berry-berry pancake? Please enjoy. What about you? How did you feel? About what's inside the book? Or about you being a fujoshi? Both. Well... I guess it's a world that doesn't concern me. Be it about homos, or about you loving homos. I knew it, he would stab someone with a straight face. What? Ando-kun, why do you speak so harshly? - I don't. - You do. You said, don't lump you and Ono-kun together, or that homos don't concern you. The word "homo" is a derogatory term to real life gay men. Isn't it better if you stop saying the word "homo"? But you were the one who said things about "homo-loving girls" and stuff. That's because... You said that word first. I don't usually say it. Want me to get a drink for you? No, if there's nothing else, I'll go home. See? That's how you always try to keep a distance. What is it? Ando-kun... Are you free this Sunday? One limited edition item per person. If you're joining the queue now, please line up at the park. This... How long do we have to queue? Today... Probably about 2 hours. Big sis! You have read "Senshojo", right? (T/N: Short for "Sensei, will you take my virginity?") What are your thoughts? Well... I felt that it was a fantasy... Which part? Well... Things went so well the first time... As a guy, this bugs you, right? Does it go in so easily? What else? And... The both of them look alike. Sometimes it's hard to tell them apart. That's disrespectful, Andy. This is just a matter of distinction of drawing, but that may be a good point. When the love interest is of the same sex, it's possible and likely that you make yourself look like them, because you like them. - That's love. - Yeah. Hey... Is she the author? No, no. She's kinda like my fujoshi master, and that's her boyfriend Hayato-san. And why did you call him Andy? Because he is Ando, isn't he? So boring. - This is so hot... - Oh no... It's not realistic at all. I know more about real gays than Nao. I'm a hair and make-up assistant. I always thought that gays have good style, I'm no match for them. I wish I'd been born gay. Have you met real gays before? Well, I don't know. Is that so? But you can tell who is one. Their gaze are different. Do you want me to tell you how to identify them? No, I'm not interested in homos. What? Andy, don't tell me you are... homophobic? No... No? Let's keep it hush... Are you still angry? I'm not. I'll sing the next song for you. Eh... this means... Haven't you realized? Idiot. She said there's a penguin with the same name as this. You... are awake? Nao! I want to see the sea lions! - Shut up. - Where are the sea lions? Where are they? - This way? - Isn't it this way? You must be thinking, "So this is how fujoshis are". Yeah. I know, right? I was lying. I wasn't thinking that. No way. I'm sure you thought so. I don't really understand, but not all fujoshis are like you, right? That's why, even if I thought so, it's not "So this is how fujoshis are", but "So this is how Miura-san is". That's even worse... I just don't want to pretend I understand. During physics class, there is this "Assuming friction is zero", right? And "Assuming there is no air resistance". I don't want to simplify the world... by ignoring all the complicated things. Then, can I ask you to help again, like today? Yeah. If it's once in a while. Do you want those goods that badly? I'm glad that even after knowing the real me, there is someone who doesn't think of me as that three-syllable word. I didn't expect you to go out with a woman who loves BL. She laid her true self bare in front of me, so I couldn't reject. But that guy called Hayato-kun? He is a totally insensitive person. Because... I didn't reveal about myself... so I'm not in the position to ask him to be considerate. That's a typical answer from you. How about you? What did you do today? I went for a walk near the sea. That place in your icon? Yes. I can't wait to cross this sea... to a place free from gender or sexual orientation, to a world of freedom. Jun-kun, Jun-kun, come here! Ando would watch it the most. I'm sure he doesn't watch AV. He doesn't look interested. - Who's your fave AV actress? - You have one? - You don't watch, right? - Do you watch AV? - You watch, right? - I do, I do. - See? - I didn't know. - That's surprising. - Surprising? I'm a guy after all. Well, I guess so. That's true. Of course he'd watch. So who do you like? Well... there's no one in particular. Ando-kun, you always eat in the canteen. What? I said, "Ando-kun, you always eat in the canteen." Oh, it's just me and my mom at home, so we don't make bentos. Sorry... I'm used to it already. Why don't you sit down? What were you listening to? - QUEEN. - Oh, I know them. Eh? Am I wrong? You're correct, but... That's so cliche... Hey, you're really foul-mouthed! Then tell me some non-cliche ones. They are quite an old band. How did you know them? From a movie. How about this? How I first discovered about QUEEN... was through Mr. Fahrenheit. I first met him, a university student who knew a lot about music from the old days, on the night when I first connected with Makoto-san. Are you bothered by this? Your hand... is cool. Do you want me to touch you with it? (Gay - First time) I wanted to talk to someone about my first time. That hurts... (Mr. Fahrenheit) (Q: Please tell me your memories of your first time.) (A: It was wonderful. I felt truly glad that I was born a gay.) (Mr. Fahrenheit: Gay, University student.) (Follow) (Following) (Q: Where's that place in your icon pic?) (A: Near the sea on the day I got together with my boyfriend) (Q: Your favourite CD?) (A: Queen II. Like what Axl Rose said, when I die, please place it in my coffin.) Do you have middle school 2nd year syndrome? Since then, I've been chatting with him regularly. He's like an older brother to me. To think she's interested in QUEEN. Isn't she someone who can understand you? If she knows about Makoto-san, she'd despise me. She'd say real-life homos are dirty. He's a married man with children yet he sleeps with a high school boy. He can certainly be described as dirty. Oh dear. I'm sorry if I offended you. Don't you... want to get married or have children one day? I can't live like the bat. Acting like a beast sometimes and like a bird at other times. I see... Jun-kun? I thought you weren't around. I'm here. You should knock first! I said "I'm home". Your girlfriend? No. Something came from Amazon. Oh... an egg stand, maybe. Huh? The kind where you put the egg on top like this. I don't think I'll ever use that. Hey, when was it again? You dropped a lot of eggs and made a mess of the kitchen. I don't remember. Feels like a long time ago. Are you old enough to keep secrets from your mother? Listen, the first day of the upcoming holiday, shall we go to Yomiuri Land? Why? Why? Because it looks fun. Go with me, Onocchi and his girlfriend. You'll go, right? But I'm not that close with Ono. Then you can just get closer. Jun-kun. Are you going to let your high school life end with no girlfriend and only a few friends? It will definitely be more fun if you get along with Onocchi! Let's do something high school-ish, yeah? Alright. Yes! Imamiya and Miura will be there too. Looking forward. What? Ouch... - Let's go. - I can't. Let's go! I can't! If you're so scared, you shouldn't have played. I don't want... I want to have fun too. But you can't have fun like that, right? Being scared is also part of the fun, right? I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry... Why are you apologizing? It's not scary at all. Are you okay? You didn't quit halfway? Onocchi! I'm counting on you. - We're counting on you. - What are you talking about? - Leaving it to you. - What? Jun-kun... You touched her boobs? I didn't touch them. - What the hell were you doing? - Ouch! OK! Next one! Alright! So, I'll ride with Imamiya. Onocchi, you go with your girlfriend. Then Jun-kun and Miura can ride one. No. I'll ride with Ando-kun. You sit with Miura. - 6 of us. - Sure, 6 people. I noticed. You aren't interested in Miura, right? What? Well... It's okay. You don't have to force yourself. Is there someone else you like? You don't have a girlfriend, right? I don't need one now. There are exams next year. You're so serious. Well, but I'm relieved to hear that. Ryohei likes Miura, doesn't he? What? What? You didn't know? You've been with him longer than me, haven't you? I think you're kinda aware already, but today's outing happened because Miura went to Ryohei for advice. She wanted him to create a chance for her to confess. He was so confused. He was like "I don't know what I should do~". I see... From the look of it, you'll reject her, right? Then why don't we team up? Let's get them together. That idiot needs us to take care of him. What is it? What's that for? I don't get it at all. Then I'll ride with Ryohei. Let's do that! No, Ryohei will ride with Miura. What? Right, Ando? Yeah. I haven't rode with Imamiya-san yet. Okay, then let's do that? Go, go, go, Bandit! Bandit! You were so confident just now. - I'm totally fine. - Look at his face. Make sure you film him, Imamiya. With this face, I can forgive Onocchi no matter how much we fight. Film this. - Then let's ride this together. - Let's! Is this one okay? Let's go with this. Ono, let's take that one. Thank you! - Oh no! - Oh no, oh no. Looking at them makes me dizzy. Those two are dead. Thank you for riding. Please remain seated and wait for the door to be opened by an attendant. - Good luck! - Go! Go in! - We'll ride this in pairs, right? - Yeah. Onocchi will be with his girlfriend, right? Enjoy yourselves. Then, how should we... You guys ride it together. No, it's okay. Let's split it this way. We're all split up nicely now. - You'll ride with me? - Yes, let's do that! They're looking here. Yay! Go on! Talk to him! - I'm sure she's nervous. - Yeah. Has Ryohei-kun always been like that? Yeah. When did you first know him? When I was five, I guess. My mom and I moved here and I had no friends... It was Ryohei who came to talk to me in the park. Are you fantasizing now? I'm not! It's obvious though. I guess so. Ryohei is a nice guy. Yeah. What? Oh, nothing... Actually... I thought of saying it only when we reach the top. But I... will probably get nervous again when I know people are looking. So I'll say it now. Miura-san... I... Ando-kun... I... Hey, look at this! That's why I'm wearing this "Tuesday" for a reason. Because it sounds like "chuu" (kiss). No good, no good. Onocchi! It's about time for them. Is Miura crying? Eh... what's going on? She already confessed? Why is she crying? She's crying so much... It can't be helped. You did your best! OK? He said OK. What? What? Then why are you crying? - That's great. - Yeah. Miura-san... I... ...am a homo. ...like you. So... Even so... I'll be in your care. I don't want to give up. Hey. Don't make her cry anymore. Congrats. - I'm happy for you. Congrats. - I'm so happy! For me, Mars is seme and Moliere is uke. As for Brutus as uke... George as seme isn't bad too. Miura-san, which is your painting? Ando-kun, what do you think? - This? - Wait! Don't! It's still a work in progress. You were the one who asked me to come here. That's because... I want you to come and pick me... kind of thing. It's not that I want you to see my painting. Let's go home. Come on. What? Big sis said the four of us should go out together some time. Limited edition goods again? No. Double date. Okay. Where? I want you to decide on the place. Alright. I'll think about it. (Double date : Have fun with friends and get intimate with your lover!) (Must-see for couples going through a rough patch! Break out of the dull routine with a double date!) (Girlfriend - Double date - Spots) (Female - Erotic videos) (Erotic videos) What kind of girl is she? Here. I think she's a cute girl. You made this? Thanks. Oh, please don't mind how it looks. Looks good. Hey! Don't look so frightened to eat it! To be dating such a cute girl, I think I'm very lucky. But that's only objectively. Although I feel for her, it's a different kind of feeling with Makoto-san. Like how "love" and "like" are different. I don't get it at all! You know, "0" and "1", it is clear which is uke and which is seme. Huh? 0 is uke and 1 is seme. Are you stupid? 2 is uke. 3 is uke. 4 is seme. 5 and 6 are uke. 7... What is 7? - Seme? - Right! Seme... 8. Yes, it's obvious. 9 is seme. Six versus four, huh. If one more becomes seme, then it'd be balanced. If 0 to 9 are all men, what balance are you talking about? I feel more energetic after talking about this. Then, this problem. Hey, Ando-kun. I'm glad you're teaching me... But the next time onwards... can we study at your place? It isn't about whether it's "love" or "like". It's about whether you can get hard, or not. - We'll prepare it for you. - Thanks. I can do 1 p.m. Yeah. Book a meeting room. Yeah, I'm having a dinner appointment now. Yeah. Thanks. Why are you grinning? Here. What? You should tell me earlier. I was even acting cool on the phone. Makoto-san, about next week... Oh, I'm sorry. Next weekend, I'm bringing my family to the onsen. I heard that it was shown on TV. Do you know this place? I can't do next week as well. Let's make up for it slowly today. Makoto-san... About your wife... Do you love her? Why are you asking this suddenly? How about... me? If your wife and I were drowning in the river, who would you save? Jun, did something happen? I... have a girlfriend. I guess my prediction was spot on. Congrats. I'm jealous... Thanks for having me. - Here are the slippers. - Oh, thanks. - Just leave your bag anywhere. - Oh, okay. Oh, Nemo. It's cute. Is it yours? My mom suddenly bought it. Wanna feed it? Yeah. Why do you want to be normal? I want a family. What else? I want my own children some day. What else? I don't want my mom to worry. What else? I don't want others to think I'm disgusting. What else? Nothing else. Really? Jun... Jun... I... don’t want to think I am disgusting. I'm sorry. It's okay. I'm still a little bit scared, too. It's fantasy indeed. For things to go so well the first time. I couldn't have normal sex. I was cheering you on though. The moment she called my name... my body remembered what kind of person I am. I'm not normal. I'm an abnormal person. (Jun, I think we should stop contacting each other) What? (Jun, I think we should stop contacting each other) (Jun, I think we should stop contacting each other) (Mr. Fahrenheit: Jun, I think we should stop contacting each other) (Jun: Why?) Let's walk home together today. - How about your club? - Exam break. OK? See you! Onocchi, come on, talk. Ando, how are things with Miura? How? What do you mean? He's asking if you've done it? I wasn't asking that. What's wrong with asking this? So have you done it? Yes? We tried... doing it. Tried? What do you mean? You came before you put it in? Well, something like that. Are you serious... You're so pathetic, Jun! - Jun! Get a grip! - Stop it. Onocchi, as a senior in this aspect, teach him how to do it. Don't want. Well, but I'm glad it was something like that. Well then, I'll go get my girlfriend. - Okay. - See you. See you. I'm sorry. Well... Onochi's really worried. He wondered if you were dating Miura even though you don't like her. He said he won't let you off if it's true. Ryohei... Actually... Actually, I... Onochi said something unnecessary, didn't he? That I like Miura or something. I absolutely don't mind it at all. Anyway, I wasn't that serious about her. Besides... When you see someone you like with the person she likes... you'd get over it, right? That's the way it is... I guess. Yeah. I've already gotten over it. I'm after Imamiya now. So I'm counting on you! For? No, I'm really serious this time. So help me, okay? Please! - But I can't do anything. I can't help you. - Please! Help me. (How about this place for the double date?) Jun-kun! Knock! Girlfriend? No. Hey, haven't you noticed anything? Eh... noticed what? Long time no see! Oh? Sae-chan, your hairstyle is different from usual? True! It looks cute! - So cute! - Thank you! I'm sorry. Oh? You brought quite a lot of things? There was a cosplay event in the morning. I see... Shall we? Yeah. I heard that tying the locker key around the ankle is a sign that they are gays. I see... There are surprisingly many of them. Why are you here? Double date. You knew I'd be here, right? Well, never mind. I could see you unexpectedly. My son. There are two gays in the sauna. I also tried putting the locker key around my ankle, and they kept staring at me. This ain't the place to talk about this. Shithead straight. I'm starting to think everyone is one. Thanks for waiting! Ta-da! - How is it? - Cute! He just said you're cute. Eh, you just said she's cute, right? Oh, you did it! - Thanks. - Yay! What? That was close! - Congratulations! - Yes! Here, second prize. Free drink coupons. Thank you! And now, it's this card named "Lover" and it represents affection. Are you both a couple already? That's right. - Is it okay? - Yes. See? Next time let's go on a date alone? Yeah. We got the order wrong, right? We have never even been on a date. I don't mind what happened that day at all. This isn't a fantasy after all. I think we should take it slow. That's right. Jun. I'm going to cross the sea. I will go to that place of freedom where nothing will bind me. In other words, these are my last words. What's wrong? Why... Ando-kun? I've been thinking about it since way before. So you don't have to worry about it. It's just that the day has come. Lastly, Jun, I need you to do me a favour. Jun. What's wrong? Have you met him before? I... said we're abnormal, that's why... It's not your fault, Jun. Why are people like us born? Why are people like us born?! Say no more. What's going on? Who is he?! - Who is this person? - Please calm down. Shut up! Old man, be quiet! Answer me. Does it matter? You like homos, don't you? I know... What she likes... is me, not homos. Welcome home. You're late. Morning, Jun-kun! What happened? You seem a little down. Hey, hey... Sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry. I touched your boyfriend's crotch without permission. In ancient texts, the subject is often omitted, although you can infer the speaker from the use of honorifics... (Are you okay? Please get in touch, just once. There's no need for you to come out, I will make sure our stories are aligned.) By the way, Fumiki, I heard you're not starting the next game. Huh? Really? Coach said so. Nobody told me. Really? Why? - I forgot my shoes. - Really? - You go first. - Okay. Sorry. I think nobody will come here. There are no club activities today. Miura-san... I'm sorry. First... Let me apologize. I wasn't exactly calm yesterday. I'm sorry about that. Continue. Miura-san. I... am a homo. That man... is my boyfriend. I saw him leaving the place with his wife and what looked like his child. Are you having an affair? Are all real life gays like that? You pretend to date a woman on the outside, but secretly go out with the man you like? Not all are like this. Do you date a woman to keep up appearances? No, definitely not. Then what? Miura-san... do you want to get married and have children some day? Yeah. So do I. I want to get married, have children, and grandchildren some day, then pass on surrounded by my family. I also find myself wishing for that kind of happiness. If it's with you, Miura-san, I thought we could have a proper relationship. But... I am after all... still a homo. I'm really sorry. What is this... What am I supposed to do? I fell for you, and after hearing all this, I can't even hate you now so what am I to do? Damn! I can't... Not my day... You knew about it? What? About Ando! That Ando is a homo! You didn't eat anything? Sorry. I didn't make dinner today. Don't worry about it. Should I take the day off from work tomorrow? It's been a while, so maybe I should cook something nice. Come home early tomorrow, okay? Really? Jun-kun, morning! Are you free after school today? Wanna hang out? It's been a while. Today I need to go home early. Ryohei, you are one of them? Don't say that. You heard about it? Jun-kun... - Oh no, I've done it... - You did... What happened? Are you crying? You're horrible... Huh? Get lost! So you're here. Chinese classics test, is it? No idea. Onocchi overheard you and Miura talking. So it's not Miura's fault. In fact it's my fault. When Onocchi asked me if I knew about it, everyone heard it. I have never looked at you in that way before. I'm not bothered by that! Well... I did wish that you had talked to me about it though. But Jun-kun, you are you after all. Hey, why are you crying? I dropped the eggs... Eggs? My mother is always crying. So I thought of making tamagoyaki for her. Shall I tell you a secret? You won't tell anyone? I'm growing watermelons in the sandpit. There will be 100 watermelon trees soon. Want to grow them together? Yeah. Then, we'll be friends for life! What I said on the first day we met, is still valid. - What was it again? - Huh? You don't remember? Never mind. This is from Miura. She said "No girls hate homos so it'll be fine". Let's head back after you've finished eating. It's boring without you. It's PE next. Wanna skip? It pisses me off that people think I've been looking at them in that way. Oh yes, have you heard about that 2nd year homo? I heard! Crazy, isn't it? What will you do if you see him? Well, of course I'd run away with all my might. You don't know how he look, right? He's called Ando? If someone stares at my dick in the toilet, I'd know it's him. Hey. I won't look at the dicks of the likes of you. I'm sorry. Hey! PE is such a pain! Get out. Hey. That's enough, Onocchi. You don't even know you've betrayed us, right? I know. Then get out of here. We can't get dressed with you around. I don't look at you in that way. How can you believe someone who's been lying to you all this time? Stop it, Onocchi. If I go to the female changing room now and say "I don't look at you in that way", you find it disgusting, right? You've kept quiet all this while because you know you are disgusting, right? Can't we just treat him the same as before? This guy has tried it out with Miura. Aren't you pissed when the girl you like gets treated that way? Today you didn't touch his crotch, right? Why is that so? - That's because... - Isn't it because you found it disgusting? You're also not treating him the same as before! I'll get out. Ono is right. Apologize, Onocchi. It's okay, Ryohei. That's enough. The watermelon trees... should be ready soon. Jun-kun? Jun-kun! Oh it's good~ Coming. Hold on... Hello? So ex! Knock first. Oh, I'm sorry. Private rooms are so expensive! Your tuition fee insurance is gone with the winds. Once a bed in the big room frees up, you're moving over, okay! Yeah. I'm relieved you got away with just this. Seriously. You know... I had one too. When I was in high school, there was a female senior I admired. I was so happy just to be able to talk to her. It's like... I wondered if this was love. I thought so... So what? Are you trying to say it's the same for me? That it's just a phase? No... I'm sorry. I've been struggling with it all this time. I thought this must be some kind of mistake. That one day I would be able to fall for a girl too. I was the one most hoping for it... I hated myself so much... for liking men. I can't even get married or let you see your grandchildren. I want a happy life in the future, but I can't... get the image of myself dying alone in some flat somewhere... out of my head... Even so... Even so... I pretended to like girls, and desperately tried to fit in... I've lived my life desperately trying to fit in. Why did you give birth to someone like me? Why am I still alive? I'm sorry. Sorry... Sorry... I'm sorry... If I were to be denied what I like, I think it would be very hurtful for me, so I think it should be recognized globally. What do you think, Nomura? Yes. Well... Isn't it wrong to say that all Americans like to eat hamburgers? So I think it's wrong to assume things like "He must be like this because he's gay." I think we should put more effort into stuff like that and sex education. I feel like they should just say it out instead of hiding it. In this day and age, there are people who become famous on social media by posting about such things. By having influential people speak out about such things, it might help to change people's perceptions. It's like, the normal... Maybe I shouldn't say "normal"... But like with heterosexual romance dramas, the homosexual ones can be just as interesting, so it'd be great if heterosexuals can understand that the feeling of love is no different for homosexuals. Why are the boys so quiet? So Daigo, what do you think? I think it's possible. - What do you mean? - You mean you can? If it's from this class... Well, I thought there was a lot going on. We had a discussion on homosexuality in class today. Not only our class, but the whole school. All levels. So the whole school knows that I'm gay. Of course. You jumped off. You're super famous now. Anyway, "The watermelon trees... should be ready soon." Are you sure that's a good farewell line? Soooo lame, isn't it? Right? Hey, we're here to visit him. Well, well, well. Oh, right. I've a date with my mother today. See you. The discussion. There were many opinions. But not a single person said that homosexuality is abnormal. They said it's not that unusual these days. But... Everyone seemed to speak as though it didn't concern them. And then, there was one other person who felt the same as me. Ono-kun. There are many mangas and dramas these days about homosexuality, so I feel that I can totally understand... You're just acting like you understand. But when one actually appears, you're bound to be curious, right? - Look who's talking. - He hasn't changed, huh. Don't interrupt when she's speaking. Did you not see him as some fictional character? I said don't interrupt! I also... thought that I understood homosexuality. So... I feel ashamed. But... I want to understand more about you. Even if I can't understand, I want to put myself in your shoes. I don't want to treat you as though it doesn't concern me. Just so you know, I'm not planning to break up with you yet, Ando-kun. Here. Well, he looked fine. His arm was... like that, though. I'm not pissed off because he is gay. I know. I know, but... That's just an excuse. I don't want you looking like that. Anyway... I'm sorry. You were pissed off, right? You were suffering so much that you sought death... yet I treated it like some fantasy... and was having fun... After thinking about it calmly, I wonder if what I did was okay. I might have unknowingly hurt you. Miura-san... Lend me your BL mangas. I also want to... understand you. Too many homos. What? That's your only comment? I get that the protagonist and his brother and friend are homos. But why are his mother and father homos too? Anyway, why is his mother homo too? Why is his mother a guy? You're asking even that? This story is all set on a BL planet. What? Some universe in American comics? It's the same as that. It's a BL universe where there are only men in it, and men alone are able to reproduce. I see. But it won't happen. You can read the second batch with that in mind. I can't finish reading all of them. Will you be discharged soon? Yeah. You'll be coming to school, right? I might transfer schools. My mom has relatives in Osaka. Sorry. If you don't mind, can you come to school just one more time? My painting won a prize at the competition. I'm going to receive the award so I was hoping you would be there to witness it. Let me think about it. Since I'm going to move anyway, I'd like to move to the BL planet. Kidding... Me too! What? Ouch... Are you okay? Wanna call the nurse? It's okay, it's okay. He's not coming, huh. And next is the presentation of awards. All recipients should come on stage. For your achievement at the Tokyo Metropolitan High School Calligraphy Competition, we will present this award to you. Congratulations. Next, Art club, Miura Sae. Yes. Award recipient, Miura Sae-dono. You're late! Sorry. ...will present this award to you. What kind of painting is it? No idea. I... LOVE BL!!! I got into BL when I was in the 5th year of elementary school. I saw my favourite shonen manga characters on the cover, so I bought it... and it turned out to be a BL based on that manga. Hey, hey, you, you, you... It's going to take a while so please wait. I was fascinated by the unknown world and found myself spending 80% of my pocket money on BL, - and became a splendid fujoshi. - That's enough! I'm only at elementary school. When I was in 2nd year of middle school, my class... She's trying to say something important! She's trying to face the things that we've been ignoring all this time! - Let me speak! - Not now! Speak in the classroom. Not here. Let me go! Hey! Shouldn't you not interrupt her speech? That's right! Don't get in her way! That's right! Don't interrupt her! I'm sorry. Excuse me, can I ask you to go this way? Please go together! I'm sorry about it! Thanks, thanks. Yes, I'm sorry. Thanks. I'll go down. I'll go down. Please watch your step. One step at a time, slowly. Sorry about it. Um... I'm not sure where I left off. Let me see... Because of the traumatic experience, I hid my love for BL in high school. But then, a certain boy found out about it. He said that he would keep it a secret, and not tell anyone I was buying BL. But I was worried so I consulted my senior... and we came up with a plan to drag him over to our side. That day, I... fell in love with him. From then on, I thought about him 24/7. My friends were willing to help me. And I finally... confessed to him. How did it go? But! Everything did not go as planned. I thought that maybe I wasn't that attractive, so I secretly worked really hard. I wondered if it's because my boobs were too small, or if my hairstyle was strange, or if I was bad at make-up. But... It wasn't that kind of problem. I used to wish all boys on earth were gay. But... the only boy I didn't want to be gay... was gay. He was suffering. He wanted to be born normal. He wanted a normal happiness. That's why he went out with me, he said. And I'm sure you are all well aware... of what happened next. There is an invisible wall... around him. That wall that he built... wasn't to protect himself, but to protect us. So that we would not feel disturbed, he would lose himself, eliminate friction, and make the world simple. He... hates himself, and likes us. But I... love him. At the start... Maybe I like him because he's a guy. But now... I love the person he is. So... I'm really glad he's alive... Are you okay? How long are you going to sit there? Don't go thinking you're the most pitiful person in the world. I don't care if you're gay or homo, it's that part of you that pisses me off. Shut up. Thanks. I love you too, Miura-san. You're crying too much. Umm... Previously... at the entrance... Yeah. I... ...too. I am one too. I've been struggling with it for a long time. I'm really sorry. The guy you were with... You like him? You were the one who brought up the gay talk that day. I did that before too. Making a joke about gays to the person you like to see how they react. But... Today, I realized once again. If there were no friction in this world, we wouldn't be able to take a step forward. Yeah, it was crazy. Did you see, Onocchi? Yes, the principal's nose! I almost broke out laughing. I was so distracted by it, nothing he said got in. Jun-kun... I've to write 20 pages of apology. Seriously, what a pain... Where's Miura-san? Oh... Seems like they're calling her parents here. But she'll be fine. She looked totally refreshed. - Does it hurt? - It doesn't hurt anymore. Oh, it doesn't. Even so, don't do this. Ando. I'm sorry. Yeah. Hey, Onocchi. You think that's an apology? If you're going to apologize, at least apologize like this! Ando, I'm really sorry. Look, look, look. Ando... I'm sorry... You hardly see Onocchi crying like this. - Look, look, look. - He's crying so much. Hey, stop it already! Ew, disgusting. That's disgusting! So ugly! You'll pay for this. Scary, scary, scary. Hey, Ando, why are you laughing? "Ando, I'm sorry... Ando... I'm sorry..." It was my most natural self, alright. (I'm going out for a while. I'll be home late, but don't worry - Jun) That's beautiful. Have you been selling here for a long time? That's right. About how many years? Secret. Secret? I see. I shouldn't ask that, right? Sure. Thank you, Madam. She said they don't make these anymore. The entire bottle is made of glass. I see... It's spilled out. I see. Woah, I'm bad at this. - Here. - Thanks. Sorry, I called you out so early. It's okay. I'm happy to see you again after so long. I... am glad I fell for you, Makoto-san. What's wrong? Let's break up. I want to drink Ramune! When I was about your age, Jun, I was really struggling, too. To get married and start a family. Apart from this, I felt that there was no other option to begin with. When we kissed at the onsen, I was thinking "I don't want my family to see this." I would save my wife. If you and my wife were drowning, I would save my wife. You cried again? I didn't cry. You're surprisingly a crybaby. He was my first love after all. Lastly, Jun, I need you to do me a favour. A trip! Would you place "QUEEN II" on my grave? I will give you my real name and address. I'd like you to visit when you feel like it. I think we're reaching soon. Oh... Call me when you're done. What? Well, I'm glad you asked me to come with you. But I think it's better for you to face it alone from here on. Yeah. Excuse me... I am... a friend of Inaba Yuki-san. This is his room. Isn't he... a university student... A university student... who has an older boyfriend... What did you say? Why did he use this photo... This is... Yuki's older cousin. He's been very attached to him since he was young. I wonder when it was... that he started to have feelings for him. Eh? You took a picture of me? No, I took the sea. After a while, he contacted me. He said that Yuki-kun confessed to him. He probably couldn't handle it alone... We desperately tried to support him. We would do anything to give our son a decent life. We also took him to see a doctor. From that day onwards, he shut himself in this room. I think he really loved him. For him to choose that photo, I feel that it's because he really loved him enough to want to become like him. My son in here... looked really happy. What an idiot. You really have middle school 2nd year syndrome. It's not coming at all, huh. Seems like it. Have you seen the schedule? It's almost empty. You know, I've been thinking about it. Why are homosexuals like you... and that boy born? And this is what I thought. Maybe God is also a fujoshi? How about lesbians then? I'm sure there are two Gods, there's a male God who loves GL, and a female God who loves BL. They must be shitty Gods then. I know, right. I think so myself. But when I think about it, there's no right or wrong. It's not so bad that our first and last date is by the sea. What? Shall we break up too? I mean... Osaka is so far. I can't do long distance. It's just not possible. Alright. Thanks. Why are you thanking me? I'm the one who dumped you. Fine. What I like... are BL, and Ando-kun. What I like... are men, and Miura-san. Was I the first real life human that you fell in love with? You're not. Don't get conceited. Let me know if you are going to the BL planet. I'll go with you. I'll stay on earth for a while longer. Wait wait, seems like Nakamu is going to confess. Eh, really? (First Love) (Miura Sae)
