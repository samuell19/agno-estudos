First International Tokyo Film Festival Winner of Young Cinema 1985 Award Film by Director Shinji Somai What’s wrong? Where did you come from? From Hokkaido! In those clothes? Tokyo is a lonely place, more so than I expected. Why is that? It’s windy and surrounded with garbage. This is Tokyo, right? - Did you come to sight-see? - Nope. - Did you come looking for a job? - Nope. You’re strange. You guys are too! So this is Tokyo! Where in Hokkaido are you from? Takinoue. It’s a place inland towards the forest, by the Sea of Okhotsk. Takinoue, huh? The way you are, you’re just like King Kong. You’re like a doll, a doll without any blood coursing through its body. You make it sound like you know what a real woman is. Yeah, I know. Her name is Kuriko. Kuriko? Yeah, I came to get her. You’re going back to Takinoue? Yeah, we’re going to manage our own farm together. She’s in Shinjuku studying accounting for it. Is that so? What? Coincidently, I know a woman named Kuriko Sakura that came to Tokyo from Takinoue. She’s working as a hostess at a snack bar. - That can’t be. - You can see for yourself. I can tell you where this Kuriko Sakura works. - Please, tell me! - All right, I’ll tell you. But in return, you’ll need to get bloody in the ring. It’s wrestling without any rules. You may get killed. I’m strong. I’ve wrestled a bear without losing. The opponent's a human? Is it okay to kill him? The audience will go wild when you kill your opponent. All the middle-aged men with their young women... You should do it! A LUMINOUS WOMAN This is what I was talking about. I’ll give you 100,000 yen. Just fight with that muscular wrestler, and I’ll give you 100,000 yen. Isn’t that woman a singer? She can’t sing anymore. She used to sing ringside and attract the audience. Mami-chan! Mami-chan! All of a sudden, she couldn’t sing anymore. Mami-chan! So, will you do it or not? You’re going to tell me Kuriko’s whereabouts if I do it, right? If the Kuriko Sakura I know is the same as your Kuriko. Get him! You can take him down! Just like King Kong. Stand up! Stand up! Hana-chan! Hana-chan! Hana-chan! - Hana-chan! - Hana-chan! Welcome! Welcome! - Hana-chan! - Hana-chan! I... I used to be an opera singer. Do you know the Scala Theater in Italy? I don't! I sang there too, though I didn’t have the main part. Be quiet! You’re ruining the song! I'm sorry! He’s also from Hokkaido. - Where in Hokkaido? - Huh? Well, where was it...? Nemuro. Yes, that’s right. He was called the Tamasaburo of Nemuro with that act. He’s actually a fisherman. What is a fisherman from Nemuro doing in a place like this? His wife left him. And he came to look for her. He came to look for his woman? It’s unsurprising that she hasn’t returned to him. Why did your wife leave you? I don’t want to talk about it. I really want to know. I’m clueless about women, so I really want to hear it. I was gone for four years. Where were you? The Soviet Union. From up north. In Shikotan in Okhotsk, we were pushed further north. It was a long four years. Why? Intrusion into territorial waters. We were following a school of fish, and before we realized, their ship was right in front of us. We lost everything, even the ship. It’s hard, huh? Being a fisherman. Did you find her? Huh? Yes, I found her. She was living with another man. She was happy. She was more beautiful than when she was with me. She somehow got bigger too. And when she laughed, it filled the whole room. I figured that’s what people call happiness. In the mountains, In the mountains, Use berries as make up Maple as hair accessory, Boxwood comb, Fox in the mountains, Mountain in the Winter, Can't sew a kimono out of dried leaves, No nice patters either Can I get a drink? I’m sorry, we’re having a private party today. Can you please go? Wait... what? What are you doing? This place is so dark. Are you trying to save on electrical bills? Sen-chan! It’s you, Sen-chan! Kuriko! I was taken aback earlier, but you’re not so bad up close. Can’t you do something about that beard? I’m leaving now. Good night. Me too, good night. - Good night. - Good night. - Thank you for tonight. - Yes, yes! - Good night. - Yes. Look at those arms of yours. They're like logs! What were you doing in Hokkaido? I did everything. From cutting trees to digging tunnels. The only thing I didn’t do was farming. And I’m a farmer! With a body like that, there are other jobs that will make you more money. No way! He’s from the country and is clueless. I’m going back to Takinoue with Kuriko. Right, Kuriko? - Are you done? - Kuri-chan, you can go now. - We will take... - I'm okay! Sen-chan, I’m sorry but can you go on ahead? I need to finish working. Then, let me know where you live. I don’t have a place to stay. I live with someone... A roommate, and the room is really small. Does it hurt? Yeah... I don’t think it’s broken, but it’s probably fractured. - You should quit. - What? You have to quit. Next time it won’t be just a fracture. What are you talking about? I always win in the end. Like tonight. It wouldn’t be a show if you won all the time. There are many pros that are stronger. I’ve seen many of them being taken in an ambulance. Take my advice and go back to Hokkaido with Kuriko. What’s wrong? I thought you found her. I found her, but... Let me go. I can’t breathe. What are you doing? Sorry, I wasn’t feeling well. Forgive me. Poor thing, I think he was dumped. Don’t lay a hand on that woman. I’ll kill you. Is she your girlfriend? She’s a commodity, precious like a diamond. You are no match for her. Hey! Hey! What's wrong? - Hey! - I’m all right. Are you all right? That’s disgusting. Oh my, that’s gross. Hey, you two! Get off! But we can’t walk! That’s not my concern. Hey, you’re an inconvenience to the other passengers. Come on. Cut it out! Stop making a mess! I'm sorry... Don’t ever get on! Stop causing trouble! Are you all right? Idiot! Damn it, you two! I’ll never let you on the bus! I’ll report you to the police! How dare they?! Stop drinking! Stop looking at me! Don’t mind them. But I do, I can’t help it. I want to move. Do you have any other place to go? No, this place belongs to the master. He’s letting me stay here while they’re waiting for the renovation to start. I have no place to go. Do you know who’s singing? It’s me. That was the past you. You were an 18 year-old genius. Now you’re just a plain human over the age of 20, eh? Now that you can’t sing, you’re just a plain woman. If I can’t enjoy your body, what’s the point of taking care of you?! I'll sing! I’ll do my best to sing! You... Yes? You’re attracted to that guy. Who? That wild and crazy guy. You didn’t look too disturbed when he held you. Furthermore, every time he gets hurt in the ring, you scream. That's because I’m afraid of blood. Yet, the other men’s blood doesn’t scare you? What’s happening with that thing? - What? - Concerning your woman? Kuriko is busy. She goes to school during the day and works at night. I don’t get to see her much. You don’t sound confident. It’s unlike you. What? You came all the way from Takinoue to get your woman. Just snatch her and go back. Don't worry. We’ve grown up together since the moment we were born. I know everything about her. - How many times have you done it with her? - Huh? I mean, with Kuriko. I don’t know if it counts as doing it. It was over as soon as my tip went in. I guess that doesn’t count as doing it. Ouch. That’s a tough one for sure. What's up? I left home. You guys are like a comedy duo. It’s nothing to laugh about. You don’t know what it’s like in the wilderness of Hokkaido or in the deep chill of the Okhotsk Sea. I don't. Women are like a treasure. We can’t live without them. Treasure, huh? I am like a treasure. He says I’m a diamond. You shouldn’t smoke so early in the morning. I'm fine. I sing with my stomach and heart, so my throat has nothing to do with it. What would happen if you couldn’t sing? I guess you aren’t a doll, after all. I didn’t know that the beard could feel so tough. It feels great! You really are a fisherman! - You think so? - Yeah! - Hey! - Oh! - What's that? - Champagne. Cheers! I, Yoshino Koyama, will be participating in a contest organized by a recording company. Is that so? Oh, here we go! I’m being forced to participate. That’s why I left home. Go on, go on! I will sing now. Let's hear it, Yoshino! On the long night, That the ship stays overnight at the port, After its long nautical journey, With a drink, we forget the hardship, at the Madros Bar, Ah, port town Ah, town! Number thirteen! Number thirteen! I love it! I’m well aware that traveling to a big city like Tokyo and going to school during the day and working at night is extremely difficult, but I’m going to do my best. - You can do it! - Kuriko! I’m going to master accounting, return to town, and I want to educate everyone in the future management of farming, and everything I learned, and contribute to restoring the town. That's it! That’s amazing! That was great! Kuriko, when you graduate in two years, you come back home, all right? You’re going to build a town with me! All right? Promise me! Sensaku, are you proposing?! - Are you sure? - Yes, I am! This is embarrassing! - Excuse me. - Yes? Do you know this place? Where? You mean here? Yes, you turn right over there, and there’s a restaurant on the left and it’s across the street. - Is someone ill? - Yeah. But it’s just a cold. That's odd. She’s supposed to be in bed. Are you all right? What are you doing?! - I’m sorry. - Do something! What do you want? Can you be my wife? What did he say? Say it again! You must be crazy! - Hey. - What? Be my wife. No, you’re disgusting. - Hey! - Hiroshi! You! - No! - Hey, be my wife. Let me go! Help me! Help me... What do you think you’re doing, idiot?! - Careful! - Cut it out! You bastard! - Be my wife! - Ouch, ouch! Please! Ouch! Hey. Hey, be my wife. Be my wife, hey! Hey, be my wife. No! Hey, please. Be my wife. Hey, hey! No, let me go! No... - Be my wife. - No! I'm an idiot. Don't push it. A woman is a woman. A woman can't live alone in the world. When night comes... What happened? The renovation is starting. You can see that, can’t you? They took everything. How are we supposed to live here? It doesn't matter. We were told to leave. Yesterday... I was fired. Why?! The audience got sick of my routine. I can’t do anything else, so... Fired, huh? Yeah. You may be next. He’s going to bring in a really tough professional. Hello? Is this Mr. Shiriuchi? He’s currently out. He’s out? Where did he go? Where? He said he was coming to see me, but he isn’t here yet. I’m sorry. I was told not to call. Kuriko? You’re Kuriko Sakura. Yes, I am Kuriko. Who are you? I'm Yoshino. Oh. The woman who sings. I can’t sing. I wanted to hear you once. Shiriuchi’s crazy about you and I’ve been jealous. We're not like that. It’s almost over between us. Kuriko? Huh? Sensaku... Sensaku? You know him? Yes. We went on a boat ride together. It was fun. That sounds like fun! Sensaku cares for you. He wants to marry you. You know that, right? Do you not like him? I do. - If it is so... - Yoshino. Have you ever loved a man? I don’t want any shallow advice. You’re late. Everyone’s waiting. My opponent tonight is you. Always on the sidelines watching. You’re a filthy rat. Are you serious? Get in the ring. - I’ll kill you. - Fine. Come! Come here! Old friend horse manure. What could you be doing now? Is the breath of the horse making your heart beat faster? In the corner of the stable. It’s a wonder how you don’t get stepped on by the horse. Are you doing well? How it hurts. The wind hurts. How much the wind hurts. It’s spring. Everyone’s heart must be beating faster. What happened to your friend, the horse tail? He was a skinny fellow. His disposition was such that a small wind could harm him. He was kind. Are the butterflies still fluttering about? My old friend horse manure. I’ve come to the city and my heart has turned black! This is the city! The day I learned to drink coffee. I became a human being with no special skills whatsoever! It's beautiful! Your song... is beautiful! You saw an awful thing. You saw, right? I did. I didn’t want to, but... What do you want? Nothing. I just... I just wanted to see you. I don’t understand, but I just wanted to see you. Even when you don’t have a purpose? I think I have a purpose. I think I do. I feel it’s really important somehow, but I can’t remember. What happened? We were supposed to have our hands working in the dirt by now. What happened? I'm sorry! I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry! Do you like that guy? I can’t separate from him. My body won’t. My body won’t separate from him. My emotions won’t separate from him. I don’t get it. You wouldn’t understand, Sen-chan. When are you going back? To Takinoue? Yes. In two or three days. I have no choice. There are lots of crows in Takinoue, but there’s a lot in Tokyo too. Do you remember? When we were kids, on our way home from school. It was wintertime, but there was this tree that was brimming. So, I threw a rock at it. Yes, and then the tree flew up all at once. A flock of crows. They were all in the tree. Right. And they all started to fly away at once. - Yes. - We held hands. Sen-chan. Can I hug you? If you want, Sen-chan... You can do whatever you want with me. Kuriko. Be my wife. Okay? Be my wife. I'm sorry... Goodbye. Ah, it hurts. I'm sorry. - Sensaku. - Huh? Why aren’t you going back to Hokkaido? I don't know. I can’t decide. It’s like I’m being made fun of. By who? Beats me. But I feel like I’m running away with my tail between my legs, and can't leave. I see. I want to go do something crazy. Something that will amaze everyone. A dream. Let’s have a crazy dream. You’re both still here? We’re not homeless. Then, give it back. We'll keep it. We’ll use it to do something crazy. There’s no one left in this town Are you singing this? For those with love, Night falls for us to sleep It's a great song. Morning comes, It's beautiful! For us to live It's great! But Mother, Thank you. I’ll give it to you. It’s a parting gift from me. There’s no one left in my town Don’t follow me! What do you want? Be my wife. Did you hear me? I heard. Are you sane? I think I am. Goodbye! Where are you going? I haven’t heard your answer. The pool. Oh, are you going to sing in the pool? I’m going to swim, what do you think? Can you swim? I'm okay. - Can you? - I grew up in the mountains, so... I see. I’ll be your wife. Really? Only if we race and you win. Teacher, we’ll be closing soon. We need to change the water. Teacher? I teach here once a week. That’s not fair! You tricked me! I’m leaving now. Are you going to race me or not? The water will be gone. I'll do it! Put on some pants. There’s some over there. I can’t wear something that’s so constricting. You can swim 50 meters, right? I think so. Start! I won! You tricked me! You can swim! The river in front of my house was pretty deep. I would play there every summer. You liar! Growing up in the mountains! I won't let you go! I want you. I really want you! Sensaku. I'll give you my body. I was actually looking for you because I wanted to learn why I was able to sing all of a sudden. You were able to sing because of me? Probably. Because I saw you hurt and bleeding. I was in pain too. I felt the pain too. I haven’t felt that kind of pain in a long time. You’re like the Ainu God. I wonder why I feel it when I see you. I thought it was strange. And I was afraid that that would be the end, so I was searching for you. I'm going to die! How many times are we going to do it?! As many times as it takes. Until you to say yes! Until you say you’ll be my wife! - There’s a fire! - The bus is on fire! The bus? It was Akanuma. Akanuma did it! - How do you know? - Akanuma did it! He's burning inside the bus. I don't get it. Why did he? He wanted to burn it. He wanted to burn everything. Everything about himself. I've been set on fire. What? I’ve been set on fire by Akanuma. What was? I was set on fire. I... Are you leaving on your own?! Take me with you! I’m carrying the weight of the burned people on my back. Idiot, stop kidding around. It's not a joke. I can't sing anymore. No matter what you say, I’m being used. I feel ashamed. I'm sorry, but I quit. Quit? I’ll ask you this. Are you the one who set the bus on fire? That's not it. Your song just happened to be playing nearby. It was a coincidence, understand? There’s a recording company that wants to send you to Italy. An educated and untrained singer like you can become a star! You have to do it! It hurts, it hurts The wind hurts! The wind hates me... Hates the one that sings... Someone call my name Should this song reach you Please call my name Every time I sing, inside my body A sad grain of sand cries The sad sand will eventually fade away Please call my name Every time I sing, inside my body My blood turns filthy! A pathetic god embraces me Yoshino? You sounded great. You were beautiful too. Thank you. Can we meet? You never contacted me after that. I wanted to know if you’d be my wife. Sensaku. I don’t think I can see you anymore, so I’ll give it to you straight. I'm a singer. And I just debuted. Goodbye. You’re the one who said it’s beautiful, like the flames engulfing the bus. So, then, why can’t you sing? It's over. What is? My songs. Not this again. It’s alive, your songs are real. The songs... The songs are real and alive. But the person singing them is hollow. It's tragic. What are you trying to say? I'll repeat the same thing. I just know. And this will be it for me. I just know. Why? Hey, you, where are you going? Takinoue. Takinoue? - Why is that? - Just because. Are you really going to Takinoue? Yes, I will. Then, get on. It really hurts. The wind hurts. It pierces my body. It hurts! Sensaku. Do something! It hurts. Something fell in my eyes. It's wet. I cried. It’s been years since I’ve shed a tear. How strange! Hello. Hello! Oh! This is the Akanuma residence, right? The man who set himself on fire in Tokyo... Are you a reporter? I’m Yoshino. I was a friend of Mr. Akanuma. Of my dad? Are you his boy? I’m not a boy! My name is Koichi. He liked to drink, so... So, it wasn’t a lie. He was a good fisherman. There’s a horse. A horse? My grandfather bought a horse for his grandson’s birthday. Meaning you? Everyone died. It’s just me and the horse. - Ma’am. - Huh? Why did you come here? I came looking for someone. His name is Sensaku and he’s really big. Oh, he came by the other day. He was so big he hit his head entering the house. And he asked if I was Akanuma’s son and hugged me, with one arm like I weighed nothing. He said he wanted to be like Akanuma. And then? He said he’d come again and that was it. I see. - He said he’d come again? - He did. Then, I guess he’ll come again. I want to go out to sea. What? It looks like the sea is shining into the distance. The current’s excited. I've seen it once before. From my dad's back. This is amazing! This is amazing! Hey, do you want to come to Tokyo with me? No, I’m going to become a fisherman! Hey, Sensaku! Sensaku. Are you pissed off? Just because you got dumped by Kuriko? Yeah. A beautiful woman came to visit you. I told about you. Yeah, but she left already. - Hiroshi. - Huh? You’re respectable. You have a wife. What are you talking about? I just brought a woman home, and did it all month long and got her pregnant. So that she can’t run away. I wasn’t going to say this, but there was a call from a woman in Tokyo. She said, “Sen-chan, help me.” A woman? She hung up after that. I figured it might be Kuriko. There’s no one else that calls you Sen-chan. That's Kuriko. That call is from Kuriko! What's wrong? I can’t wait. I need to go to Tokyo. Kuriko is asking for my help. You don’t even know if it was Kuriko. The guy who answered the phone said it didn’t sound anything like Kuriko. It‘s Kuriko, I’m sure of it. I'm not losing this time. Sen-chan! What did you come here for? For what? You called me for help. I called? Is that right? My head’s in a haze. I’m told that visitors are allowed after three. Don't come in. You haven’t sung for me yet. Yoshino is the only one who comes to visit. She always sings for me. It’s been a while. Yes. I wanted to see you in Takinoue. You came to see me, right? Yes. Yoshino likes Sen-chan. Idiot! And that’s why she scolds me. For abandoning you and Takinoue. If I abandoned the two most important things in my life, I would obviously suffer. Am I important? Yes. You’re important. I didn’t think the call would reach you. Why? You know the bus that was on fire on the west side of the station? Yeah. I thought you were the one. I don’t know why, but I thought that was you. I thought Sen-chan had died. Is that why you wanted to kill yourself? No, it’s unrelated. The man won’t come back. You mean Shiriuchi? I took medication while I was waiting for him. I overdosed. And went completely crazy. Should I have set myself on fire? Is that what you think? I’m crazy. I came to Tokyo from Takinoue and I became crazy. I thought you took revenge for me, Sen-chan. In the papers, it said a homeless person from Hokkaido. I thought it was definitely you. I was probably already crazy then. It wasn't me. That’s why I didn’t think the call would reach you. I just wanted to call Takinoue. I wanted to hear the sounds of Takinoue. Yoshino! I’m sorry, but can you please take care of Kuriko? He has a gun. He thinks you’ll be back, so he has a gun. I see. Sensaku! Yoshino. I have a really good hand. Can you wait another game? I can’t wait. You can play a game with me. Unfortunately, I’m tired from lack of sleep. I’ll put you in a nearby ocean. Where you can hear Yoshino singing every night. She won’t sing anymore. She won’t sing in this dusty, miserable place anymore. I’m taking her to Takinoue. You’re just like Kuriko. You don’t see that you’re being played. I'm serious! Shut up. Kuriko still loves you. Kuriko died. Is this Kuriko's? I want to take Kuriko back to Takinoue. I need to take her back. I made up my mind. I’m making you my wife no matter what. Please, call an ambulance. Yoshino. Let me... hear you... one last time. No more. I won’t sing here anymore. Goodbye. Koichi, what are you planting? I’m planting an acorn. When it grows, we’ll eat here. I told him there are other trees that would grow faster. The red pepper tree will grow fastest! - Hey, granny. - Huh? We should plant Akebia. They’re delicious. Yes, Akebia is good. We’ll have snakes here! Snake of Akebia vines Children of Akebia vines Let’s walk behind the wind Let’s walk behind the wind The sacred fig, soapberry and hackberry are trees of blessing Their fruits and even their wood support us The acorn and the jujube are the bounty of summer Keiji Muto Narumi Yasuda Michiru Akiyoshi Kei Suma Hide Demon Leonard Kuma Masato Ise Shigeru Kodama Saburo Date Chigusa Takayama Hitomi Nakahara Produced by: Shigeaki Hasama, Isao Okawa Hiroshi Yanai, Hiroshi Yamamoto Yuzo Irie, Susumu Miyasaka Planning: Susumu Miyasaka, Masahiro Sato Original Work: Hiroshi Koyama Executive Producers: Kei Ijichi, Tsutomu Yamamoto Screenplay: Yozo Tanaka Music: Shigeaki Saegusa Cinematographer: Mutsuo Naganuma Lighting: Hideo Kumagai Art direction: Tomio Ogawa Gaffer: Toshio Nakano Editing: Akira Suzuki Assistant Director: Yasuyuki Otani Directed by: Shinji Somai
