See you guys later. See ya. Susan: There are over 270 million people in this country, 35 million in California alone. That's why it's taken so long, Cheryl Ann. That's why it's been like trying to find a needle in a haystack, and they could have been anywhere, but we did it. After all this time we found them, and now we're finally gonna make things right.

You ever go riding? Sometimes. I got just the filly for you. I can ride anything you got. Whew! There you were, like one of them angels in a museum painting. Boy, you sure are a pretty one. Had a feeling about tonight. Yeah? You know. Something special's gonna happen. Something real special. I know... 'Cause I had that exact same feeling. You a real cowboy, will? Yes, ma'am. I want to do something bad, will. Something really, really bad. Mmm. I can feel your heart, will, right here. It's racing. I think that you want me to be bad. Mm-hmm. Say it. I want you to be bad. If I'm really, really bad, will... And if I say I'm sorry... I hope you'll forgive me. Don't hide from me, Karen mills! You're a bad, wicked little girl! But you're gonna be good from now on. Know why? 'Cause I've got Cheryl Ann, and I just might rip her pretty little head off! Mine! Fucking asshole! It's all right, Cheryl Ann. Dad, there's somebody here at the door. I know. No, hold on. Hold on, son. See who it is. Hi. I am so sorry. I've had a car accident. Can I please use your phone? Oh, well, please, come in. Please, please. Thank you. You ok? What...What... Oh, yeah. I'm all right. Thank you. Well, here. Put this down. Oh, thanks. What happened? Oh. I was on the freeway, and I got off to get some food. I got lost, and this deer jumps out in front of me. I swerved to avoid it, and my car ends up in the ditch, and I am so, so sorry for imposing. Oh, no. Don't worry about that. I'm Jesse Conner. Uh, Susan Heller. Susan, this is my son buddy. Nice to meet ya. Would you like a glass of water or anything? Uh... Jesse: Buddy, get her a glass of water. Buddy: Ok. Jesse: Ok. Susan: Thank you. I am so sorry. Jesse: No, please. Don't worry about it. Jesse: Do you have any idea where the car is? Susan: Just a mile or so up the road. Hi, honey. Hi. I saw the lights, and I heard all the dogs. Dad. Uh, Susan Heller, right? Yeah. Susan, this is my daughter Linda. Linda, Susan. She just had an accident up the road. Oh, no! Dad, mom's up. Oh, yeah um, Susan, excuse me. Uh, my wife's been a little under the weather lately, so... That means she's been feeling kind of sick, but she's getting better, right, dad? Yes, she is. She's gonna be fine, son. Fine. Uh, if I could just... Use the phone to call a cab... A cab? Well, they stop running at 7:00. Oh. Uh, listen, it's gonna be a lot easier to find your car in the morning than it is in the middle of the night, and we have a fine guest room here. You're welcome to use it. No, no, no. I couldn't impose. Please, just say yes. Yes. All right. Well, here it is. So, uh, where were you headed, Susan? Oh, outside of San Diego. I was working horses up in vallejo and, uh, needed a change of scenery. Oh, you work horses, huh? Mm-hmm. About 7 years. Great! Well, ok. Listen, uh, we'll get your car taken care of in the morning, uh, first thing, ok? Thank you, Mr. Conner. Uh, Jesse. Thank you, Jesse. Great. Ok. Sleep tight. Ok. We're gonna fit right in, Cheryl Ann. Right in, just like I promised, and they don't suspect a thing. Why did you come? You don't belong here. Yes, I do! Nobody wants you. Aah! You're better off dead. Please! Please! Please, don't! Please! Please, don't! Please! Buddy: Susan? Please, don't. Please, don't. Susan? No! Get away from me! No, it's me! It's buddy! It's ok. Susan, you ok? Come here. Come here. Come here. Come here. Oh, my god! You--you ok? I just... Yeah. I just had a horrible nightmare. I had one of those once. I don't know. It must be the strange bed. Uhh! Ok. Thank you for coming to my rescue. Nightmares, they... They can be scarier than real life sometimes. Huh? They sure can, buddy. Do you want a glass of water? Uh-uh. I'm ok. You go to bed. Good night. Jesse: Couple of holes in the radiator. Well, it doesn't really look all that serious. We ought to get this thing fixed in no time. Great! Susan, meet our resident mechanic. I'm also Jesse's trainer. Name's Paris. France? Texas. Ah! Sheriff Tom! Excuse me. Buddy: Sheriff Tom! Hey! How you doin', buddy? Buddy: Yes! Good to see ya. Uhh! How you been? Good. Why don't you give me a second with your dad real quick, hmm? Here. Come in here. Yeah? Ha ha! What's up, huh? I don't know how I'm gonna sugar-coat this, Jesse. Will's dead. He was murdered last night. My god, wh-wh-wh... How'd it happen? What... Do you think she'll live? Paris: When a car overheats like this, it's most likely a hole in the radiator, but you can never tell for sure. You know what I'd like to do? What's that? Take her to the barn, stretch out on my back, and take a good long hard look underneath. You know, I'm sure, in the right hands, she'll be just fine. Well, I can't wait to tell her the good news. Found him down there in a hotel room. Los Angeles. Oh, man. God, how am I gonna tell the kid? Jesus. Paris: I don't mean to sound hard-hearted, Jesse, but this... This thing with will leaves us a hand short. The timing couldn't have been worse. Tell me about it. I warned will about going to those kind of places. Will gave me this. He told me if I was ever in trouble, I should just blow on this real hard, and he--he'd come running. Oh, buddy, I know will was your best friend and you miss him real bad right now, but you're gonna find a new best friend to come running. Yeah? Yeah. Jesse: The girl says she works horses. You're thinking of hiring her? You like that idea, do you? Huh? Well, like you say, girl works horses. Get her unhitched, buddy. Ok. Uh, listen, you mentioned last night that you, uh, had experience working with horses, right? Yeah. Jesse: Well, as you know, we're a little short-handed and, uh... If that's a job offer, the answer's yes. Jesse: All right. Well, I'm gonna go on over to the office, and when you finish here, come on over, ok? Yeah. What do we got here, buddy? Ok, Jeff. Just let us know when you can. Linda: Ok. Hey, dad. Did you hear about will? Yeah. Tom gitlin was here about 10 minutes after Paris left. Can't believe it. Been checking around, trying to find a replacement. Jeff Artemis, he's a maybe. I offered the girl the job. You what? Well, I don't understand. We lost a man, and I replaced him. What's the problem? The problem is that we were supposed to be a team here. Here I am, trying to repair the damage ned did, with no end in sight, dad. Ned bunning was my accountant for 28 years. Ned was sick. He did not do the job. Honey, he was my best friend. What was I supposed to do? You didn't even check her out, did you, dad? That's right. You know what your problem is? Hmm? Hmm. You've been reading too many of those detective stories, you know? Lighten up a little, ok? God. And you'll be fortunate enough to be working with me most of the time. How lucky can a girl get? Susan, Linda's got some papers for you to sign back in the office, soon as you can, right up there. You wanted to see me? I've got an application for you to fill out. Um, your dad seemed upset. That wasn't because of me, was it? No. Of course not. You can start tomorrow, Susan. Take the day to settle in. Ok. When am I gonna get to meet your mom? Well, sometimes, when her hip is hurting, she likes to keep to herself. Says her medicine makes her feel kind of wacky. So, this used to be Linda's room. Now it's Susan's. Um, if it's ok with you, I want to be alone and put away my things. Ok. I'll see you at lunch. Bye! Bye. Did you hear what he said? This is Susan's room. I think I'm gonna go see what the rest of our castle looks like. That's Victoria. She is a bird of paradise. Isn't she gorgeous? Yeah. I'm Susan Heller. Yes, I know. I'm Maggie. That was me last night in the hall skulking around like Ophelia's ghost. Certain painkillers bring out the dramatic in me. You're quite a looker, Susan. Thank you. Watch out for Paris. My plants remind me of what a big and exciting place our planet is. You have the whole world right here, Maggie. It's the closest I'll ever get to seeing it. Don't ever listen to a man when he tells you he's going to retire from what he loves. If you want to do something, really need to... Just do it. Otherwise you'll be like... Anyway. End of lecture. So no matter what it is, Maggie? Yes, no matter what it is. I promise. Good. Come on. I'll show you the rest. Ok. Man: Yeah, I'll get right on it this afternoon, Jesse. Mom, do you spell vallejo with one "l" or 2? 2, I think. Jesse: 2, absolutely. Mm-hmm. 2. I thought so. You spelled it with one "l" on your job application. I figured I was wrong, but I guess not. Oh. I'm gonna have to be more careful next time. So what kind of stock are you workin' up there? Pretty much the same as you have here. A lot of ranchers up north are starting to switch over to standard breds. I would really love to work with trotters and pacers someday. Are you guys thinking of bringing them down here? I don't know. I don't know. What do you think, Maggie? I think it's your call, Jesse. So do you have a lot of family up north, Susan? No, I lost my family in a car accident. They'd just dropped me off at summer camp. I was 8. Well, that's terrible. Sorry. The sheriff's here. Probably about will, I suppose. Susan, can I show you somethin'? What? Mom, may I please be excused from the table? Yes, dear. Thanks. It's a secret. Excuse me. Maggie, pass me that juice. She seems to know what she's talking about. Is, uh, somethin' botherin' you about her? I don't know. You've got friends up north. Ask around. Well, you know me, never could say no to a pretty lady. Susan: What are you gonna show me, buddy? It's a secret, best friends' secret. You know, Susan, I'm... I've been thinking. About what? Best friends. I was--i was thinkin' maybe, um... Y-you would wanna be my new best friend? It's a really easy job. I'd like that. Yeah? Yeah. Ok. Girls are slow. Come on! Ah! Ow. Damn it. Ah. Ok. Ok, now, watch your head. Ok. Oh, buddy, this is so cool. You like it? Yeah. Yeah? Wait. There's more. Ok. Whoo... Let's make a wish. Ok. I think it goes to China. So who else knows about this? Maybe some people in China. Jesse: 2 words? Uh-uh. 2 syllables? Uh, second word! Second word. Second word. Sounds like. Sounds like...Uh, you're throwing something. You're fishing. Fishing. You're reeling in. You're, uh, uh... Line. Hook. It's quite the collection, huh? Are these all whodunits? Mostly. Uh, walking with... Frustrated detective, huh? Sort of. Smile, Linda! Buddy! Smile! Ok. Ha ha ha! Thank you. Are you gonna play the next one, Susan? Um...you know what? Maybe later. Smile. Ha ha ha! Jesse: Dig the, uh... Maggie: Gray? The gray--gray? Gray? Gray! It's all gray. It's all gray. No! Get outta here! Damn painkillers. Yeah. Maggie said they brought out the dramatic in her. Huh. She said that? Mm-hmm. You know, maybe she should switch medication. Something like dropadine might work better for her. She tried it. You seem to know a lot about the subject. My mom was a nurse. I thought you said you lost your mom when you were a child. Yeah? Dropadine didn't come out until the last couple of years. I, uh, um... I must have read it somewhere. Now, listen, Linda, I would really like for us to be friends, but I feel... Well, that I have to explain myself to you. Am I interrupting something here? No. Ah, Linda. Susan! Hold up. What happened back there? Oh, it's no big deal. Linda and I just had a little communication problem is all. All right, we'll work it out. Don't worry. I'm gonna head on back up to the house. Thanks for a wonderful evening. I'll see you tomorrow night. Glad you could join us. I got a lot of work to do tomorrow, so see you in the morning. Good night. Good night. We've had people who didn't like us before, and we just have to learn to get along with everybody, even nosy Linda. Well, buttercup's lookin' good. Yeah. I like working her. You ever run into a guy in vallejo by the name of Alan volke, raises Tennessee walkers? Yeah. Well, Alan volke raises thoroughbreds, not Tennessee walkers. You ever spent any time in vallejo, you'd know that. Oh, yeah. Alan volke, thoroughbreds. Why are you lyin'? Uh... Hmm? My previous employer, uh, was powerful and vindictive, and when he tried to force himself on me, well, he regretted it. So that left a giant hole in my resume. Eh, I got creative. But, uh, I did pass through vallejo with 2 elves on my way south. Hmm... Ok, just give me the saddle. There you go. By the way, Alan volke... He raises quarter horses. You know, it's not that I don't like sex. I just like to choose who I have it with. Hmm. Mmm... Hi. Hey, Linda. Oh. Oh... Damn deposit slips. Last year's tax return... "3.8 million gross." "900,000 net." Luis! Why is big bill in his stall? I'm picking him up now. Ok. You just saved me a truckload of pain and humiliation. Thank you. You're welcome. I was just about to call an ex-boyfriend in L.A. I'm still in love with him, and, unfortunately, he was in love with himself and broke my heart. I don't know what I was thinking. I owe you one. Thanks. I was talking to will. He told me I wasn't dumb. It just takes me a little while to think... Things in my head. Will told you that? Mm-hmm. Today. What else did will say? Well... That we'll always figure things out together. And I'll always do the right thing. Sounds like he's pretty right to me. Yeah? I think it's time you get to bed though. That's what I think. Thanks, Linda. I'll see you tomorrow, buddy. I love you. Sleep tight. Ah, they need a bath. Who named you? Ok... let's see. Aaaaaaah! Is Paris working you hard enough? Mmm, I like working hard. Heh heh heh heh. Dad, dad! Dad, come on! It's mom, come on! Dr. Sussman to the O.R., post-op. Dr. Sussman to the O.R., post-op. Don't you die on me, old lady. You think they're gonna give her a shot? Oh, I don't know, buddy. Shots hurt. But they're for your own good. That's what mom always tells me. Mom? Mom, are you all right? Yeah. Well, she's got a few bruises, but Dr. Miller says the replacement's doing just fine. She's gonna be ok. You hear that, Susan? Mom's gonna be a-ok. Yeah, that's great. Oh, you had us worried, Maggie. Let's get her home, what do you say? So there's this guy and he's wearing a bow tie, and he wants to buy an in. Did they give you a shot, mom? I'll see you later. Karen? Mom, are you ok? Paris told me what happened. I'm ok. She never should have been on the damn ladder in the first place. Oh, mom. God. Buddy, go get the door. I got it. You can't let your anger control you, Karen. That's why you're here. Ow! My anger's the only damn thing they can't take away from me. Karen? Code blue, room 128. See you back at the ranch. Code blue, room 128. See you at home. Ok. All right, here we go. Easy. Susan, could you help her, please? Thank you. Hey, can I help? Uh, no, really, honey. We got it all under control. Thanks. Susan's gonna put mom to bed. Night, buddy. Thank you. Are you feeling better? Yeah. Susan, would you be a dear and get me my moisturizer? Yeah. Thanks. It's the big white jar on the vanity there. Give me your hand. It was some night, huh? We could do with a little less excitement around here. Want some juice? Yeah. Thank you. It's been rough, hasn't it, since Maggie broke her hip? Well, between the drugs and pain, sometimes I hardly recognize her. So what happened, Jesse? Well, she's going through a spell. You know how women get when they get itchy and they want to go everywhere, see everything? I bought her a horse to take her mind off of it. It's a beauty, too. Big palomino. And she fell? Yeah. First time she rode him. I'm really worried about her. She'll be fine. You shouldn't worry. Well, you know, now she can't go anywhere. You know, bad things happen. It's nobody's fault. Life goes on. Thank you. Um...we really.... I ought to call it a day. What do you think? Yeah. Oh, he wanted to. I know it. He likes me. He knows I belong here. He just doesn't know why. Luis needs buddy today, so why don't we split things up? Uh, you take mom this morning, I'll take her this afternoon. Paris says we ought to be back sometime between 1:30 and 2:00. You know, i--i can't. I gotta fax '96-'97 to Sacramento by 2:00. There's no way I'm gonna be ready. Oh, I'd love to stay with Maggie. Oh, great. Problem solved. Great. Hah. Problem solved. Well, who rained on your parade? Have you talked to your friends up north yet? Let me guess--Susan. You didn't answer my question. I got some calls out, nothing yet. How's her work? Well, she seems to know her business. Keep calling. Love 'em, just never try to understand 'em. Listen, I am eternally grateful to you. Oh, I'm happy to do it. Um, about last night... Oh, look, forget about it. Nothing really happened anyway, so don't worry about it, all right? Good. Thank you. See you later this afternoon. Ok. Small, with thick eyeglasses. Woman: Oh, you must be talking about calista Davis. Calista Davis? She's gone on a 3-week vacation. 3-week vacation? You're kidding. Would you like to leave word? I'll just call back. Thanks. Hello, calista Davis. Calista on machine: This is calista. Leave a message. Hi, uh... my name is Linda Conner. I need to discuss a mutual acquaintance with you. Please, if you could call me back, it's important. My number here is 555-0145. Thank you. Karen. I had to make sure. You look great. You--you haven't changed a bit. You, uh, you have no idea how many times I've thought about you. So what are you doing here? Um, I, uh... I--i called out to you the other day, at the hospital. Didn't you hear me? No. Maggie on intercom: Susan. Um, this is a bad time. So I've got to go. Susan? You there? Who's Susan? Um, will you just give me a minute, and I'll be right back. Ok. Maggie on intercom: Susan, can you hear me? Hello. Hello. I'll be there in a minute, Maggie. I haven't eaten all morning. I'm making lunch right now. I'll bring it to you in, uh, about 10 minutes, ok? Hmm. You know what? Don't bother with that. I feel like eating in the kitchen with you today, Susan. Maggie, I promised Jesse I'd make sure you stayed... In bed. Why is she calling you Susan? Because that's who I am now. Why are you always poking your nose in other people's lives? Why don't you mind your own business? Calm--calm down, Karen. I--i didn't mean to upset you. Maggie on intercom: Hello. Susan. I'm your friend, Karen. I-I've always been your friend. Why are you doing this to me? I never asked you to be my friend, and I told you to leave me alone back then. Karen, no! My glasses! You won't be needing those. Maggie on intercom: Susan. You should have listened. Please... Maggie: Susan. Susan, where are you? I'll be right there, Maggie. I have to clean up something first. Well, all right. Just hurry. Susan... Susan, are you in here? Why didn't you answer me? You're not supposed to be up. Well, I'm tired of staring at the same 4 walls. Is my lunch ready? Um, I'm just about to make you a sandwich. But you're gonna get me in trouble-- I know, but I'm hungry. Oh, ok, but let's get you back in your room-- was somebody here? No. Could have sworn i-- Heard something. Oh, this is great. Hello? Hi, it's Linda. Yeah. Uh, Maggie's up. I just brought her a sandwich. Oh, I'm gonna be a little late for lunch. I'm running a bit behind here. Um, I tell you what. Why don't I make you a sandwich and bring it down? And then you can just keep working. Well, I don't want you going out of your way or anything. No, no, no, no, it's no bother, really. I insist. Ok. Bye. ♪ They all ran after the farmer's wife ♪ ♪ she cut off their tails with a carving knife ♪ ♪ have you ever seen such a sight in your life? ♪ ♪ As three blind mice Ha ha. Luis gets real mad at me when I forget my lunch. He says, "a man's gotta eat." But I don't got a lot of time. It's a real rat race out there. A ham sandwich. Can I have some cranberry juice, please, to drink? Mm-hmm. Thank you. What does Linda like? Diet coke. Ok. My mom. She said I gotta chew each bite 10 times before I swallow.

Bye. You should never drop in on somebody... Without calling first. To exercise... Hey, mom. Hey. Have you seen Susan around? Uh-uh. Afternoon TV stinks. You were supposed to be taking care of Maggie. Where have you been? Oh, I was just bringing a little color to Maggie's life. So how are you feeling, Maggie? Mmm. What you doing, son? Lazy afternoons, starlit Kentucky nights, you and me. Cheese. I'll have a piece. Oh, god, I shouldn't, but, uh, all right, I will. Linda? No, thank you. Anything you can find out about her, oh, I'd really appreciate it. No problem. Linda... You're probably gonna say no, but, uh, you want to have dinner one night? I'll give you an answer on one condition-- you take off those ridiculous sunglasses. Well, what's the answer? Not "yes" yet. Ask me again later. Susan really worries me, Tom. Well, just give me a couple of days. Hey, we just got an invite from Perry Hanks down near louisville. He says toward the end of the month he's gonna have some real winners for us. You wanna go? Oh, I'll never be finished by then. I'd love to go. Well, sure. Uh, that'd be great. I could use the company. Hello? It all checks out. Susan is who she says she is. No, she isn't, damn it. She could have faked an identity. I mean, there are books and web sites that could tell her how to do that. Anything's possible. Well, you gave it your best shot. Thanks. You're welcome. Listen, uh, I was wondering if maybe you wanted to get together to discuss that dinner date you talked about? Ok. Ok. So I'll just, uh, I'll talk to you later. All right. Bye. Bye. Listen, bill tuft's got a new breeding stock over at his ranch. We're gonna go over on Tuesday and take a look at it. You want to come with us? Oh, that's my day off, Jesse. I can't, I made plans. Ok. Have a good night. Good night. This Tuesday belongs to us, Cheryl Ann. It's the day our pain finally stops. I swear to you. No one is taking that away from us. No one. You sure you gonna be ok, sweetheart? Of course I'm gonna be ok. I feel like I'm deserting the ship. You got a day off. Enjoy it. It's the rules of the ranch. Come on, dad, Paris is waiting. All right, sweetie. Bye-bye. See you this afternoon. Ok. I'm gonna be in the office all morning, so I'm just a phone call away. Please, would everyone stop this? I had a fall, I'm a little black and blue. I'm not an invalid. Actually, I'm looking forward to having a nice hot bath without the entire family hovering over me. Hovering? Yes, dear. You do hover sometimes. I love you anyway. I love you, too, mom. Would you like me to tidy up here before I go? No, dear. I can take care of it, thanks. You sure? I'm sure. Go, go. Have fun. Have a good day. I will. They lined us up according to height. Susan, I thought you left. Everybody praying like there was no tomorrow. Dear sweet Jesus... Please let the smiling fat lady and her skinny husband pick me. I promise I'll never be a bad girl again if only I can have a real mommy and daddy to love me. What are you talking about? But they never picked me. The best that I could have was foster moms and dads. 'Cause you see, Maggie, I was a problem child. And problem children need special attention. Let's not forget about the foster mothers who were convinced that the foster kids weren't good enough to eat with the rest of the family. And the foster dads, who knew just what the little girls wanted. The social workers who turned the other way. Stay down! Stop it! You're scaring me. Could you have any clue what I'm talking about? So let me paint you a picture, Maggie. It's a small, red-brick hospital on the outskirts of Wichita. She's in labor. She's not married to the father of the child, and she never will be, because he's dead. Got himself killed in Vietnam. So she's agreed to give the baby up. I mean, could you imagine a mother giving up her own flesh and blood? And guess who that girl is, Maggie? Oh, my god. Yeah, oh, my god! You let them take me away. Why? Times were different then. My parents, they were very, very religious. They forced me to do it. They forced me to give you up. I wanted you very much. Do you know-- do you know what it's like, being completely alone, do you know? Do you know what day today is? Um, it's Tuesday, the... Oh, that's right, Maggie. It's my birthday. And we are gonna celebrate. What are you doing? Oh, god, you have to believe me. I tried to find you, but the records were sealed. Do you remember what you named me? Yes. Then say it. Karen. Say, "happy birthday, Karen." Say it. Happy birthday, Karen! Happy birthday, Karen. Then I want you to look at me... So you can see what the next Mrs. Jesse Conner looks like. No! Don't! No. Karen! Stop, stop! Stop! Don't. Don't! Please, Karen. I'm your mother. Please don't. I've waited for this my entire life. No! Party's over, mom. Hey, mom. You in here? She called this her magic place. And when I'm missing her, a lot... This is where I'm gonna be. 'Cause mom always said, "we're all together here on the ranch... "And when something bad happens to one of us, it happens to all of us." I miss you, mom. And I love you. Amen. Amen. I know it's hard to lose your mom at any age, buddy, but at least you had her all these years. Woman: Nurses' station. Linda: Yeah, I'm calling to see if calista Davis will be in tonight. Uh, yes, ma'am. She's back from vacation? Yes. Her shift starts at 8:00. 8:00? Mm-hmm, 8:00. Great. Thank you. It's really important that I talk to nurse Davis. You see this face? This is the face of a tired woman. They said she'd be back from vacation today. No call, no nothin', and that ain't like her. Maybe she found the man of her dreams. The night before she went on vacation, she thought she recognized somebody. She called her Karen. Did she say anything about that to you? Yeah, really shook her up. Somebody from a previous job, she said. What was her previous job? An institution. Um, I don't remember. Um, in L.A., I think. Look, sweetie, I really have to go. Why don't you call human resources in the morning? I don't know if you can get anything from them, but you can try. Thank you. Oh, my god. It actually works. Let's see... "Carson correctional facility." Man: Carson correctional. Hi, um, can you tell me when I can speak to someone in administration? They'll be here at 8:00 tomorrow. 8 A.M. Yes. Thank you. You're welcome. There we go. Giddyap. Linda left about an hour ago. Where did she head so early? Oh, god. Women are a mysterious breed, Paris. I've never been able to figure 'em out. It's fun trying, though. You're, uh, looking good there, Mr. Commissioner. Oh, well, thank you very much. Somebody's got to keep an eye on these politicians. They'd zone us out of existence if they could. Oh, I just got off the phone with Harry Hanks. Oh, good. Is Kentucky still on? 2 weeks from tomorrow. I'm ready. I'll see you later. Woman: You're aware she hasn't worked here in years? Linda: She was last seen talking to a woman she called Karen, a woman she identified to a colleague as having known when she was employed here. Any idea how many karens have come through this place? She'll be in her early 30s. Look, we have 623 inmates and almost 150 in staff. Yes, I remember calista Davis. No, I don't remember if she had a special relationship with someone named Karen, inmate or staff. Maybe you could check your files. Are you kidding? Channels, sweetie. That's the way you do it. You go to the police, you report your aunt missing, you tell 'em all about this Karen. Then they may or may not come here and look through my records. Now, if you'll excuse me. Psst. Nurse Davis, s-she took an interest. She cared about what happened to us. She tried to help Karen mills. Karen mills? What was she in here for? She claimed her stepfather was-- was doing things to her. So one night, while he was sleeping off a drunk, she torched the house... Burned him to a crisp. Is this-- is this Karen mills? I don't know. I--i can't tell. I'm not sure. Sorry. This Karen of yours. Does she have a doll with one of those pull rings in the back? You know, it said the name Mary Ann, I think. Thank you. Conner residence. Buddy, it's Linda. Hi, Linda. I want you to do me a favor, ok? Yep. I want you to take the phone and go into Susan's room. What if her door's closed? It's ok, buddy. It's a game. Oh, it's like one of those detective games? That's right, and you're Sherlock Holmes. Ok, I'm going. I'm inside, Watson. Ok, Sherlock. I want you to go over to the closet. There should be a black duffel bag. Do you see it? Mm-hmm. Ok... I want you to look inside and see if there's a doll with blond hair. Ok. Is it there? Yeah. Does she have a pull ring on her back, buddy? Uh-huh. Pull it, buddy. Pull the ring. Doll: Hi, my name is Cheryl Ann, and I love you. Hey, give me my fucking doll! They didn't teach you about privacy in your moron school? It wasn't a moron school. It was a special school! Hello? Linda, is that you? Buddy! I know I said a terrible thing. Man: Good afternoon, city hall. Linda: Could I speak to someone in zoning, please? Just a moment. Second man: Zoning, can I help you? Yes, I'm looking for Jesse Conner. Is he still there? No, ma'am, they're gone. Left about, oh, 5 minutes ago. Do you know where they went? Did they go to lunch? Oh, no, ma'am, they just went. Ok, thank you. You're welcome. Buddy? Ollie-Ollie oxen free? Buddy? Mm-mmm. You seen buddy? What are you doing? I'm fantasizing. Don't you want to know what I'm fantasizing about? Ok, Paris, please. I just had a serious misunderstanding with buddy, and I need to see him. I'm fantasizing about you and me... In Kentucky. So do you want sex right here now with the mud and the horseshit? I prefer a bed with clean sheets, but this will do. Sweetheart... I've been your friend since the get-go. I have backed you up. I have lied to Linda for you. And now I get the feeling that you're playing me. I'm getting real sick of it. Yeah? Fuck you! Buddy? Buddy? Are you in here? Ok, I know that you're mad at me, and you should be. Come on, buddy. Best friends talk things out. They forgive each other. Oh, I forgive you. What do you want? I don't like being dismissed. This is a cozy little place you got here. It's buddy's. Well... Thank you, buddy. I told you once, I choose who I have sex with. Well, I was hoping you'd choose me. Hmm, you see, you must have forgot. You're the one with something to lose. Buddy? You're a problem, Paris. I got more problems than I need right now. We never stood a chance, the two of us. I think it has something to do with your name. I mean, Paris. Give me a break. Susan, Susan, Susan, for god's sake, help me, I'm slipping. So just let go. What? Be much less painful. For god's sake, help. I swear to god I won't-- I won't tell anybody anything. J-just help me out of here, please. You know, we're a lot alike. Susan, come on. Don't do this. You gotta-- I can't trust you. Help me out of here. God. God, don't, just-- just give me your-- aaaah! What should I do, will? Will? Buddy! Buddy! You saw what Paris tried to do to me! Conrad, what are you doing here? Clogged drain in your folks' tub. Yeah, here's the culprit. You seen buddy? Nope. Buddy? Just keep it together. The eye on the doughnut. Damn it, focus! Buddy? Buddy? Buddy, are you in here? Buddy? If you're here, come out. Susan can't hurt you. Susan: I don't want to hurt him. I caught him snooping through my things, and I lost it for a second and I said things that I shouldn't have. Yeah, he gets upset when people call him a moron. Where is he? I don't know. Linda, something terrible just happened. He tried to rape me-- Paris. God, I was looking for buddy up at our secret place up in the hill and... Paris must have followed me there. Guess where I just came from. We fought and... Oh, god, I went crazy... And I hit him, and he fell, and poor buddy saw the whole thing. Carson correctional institution. Listen, Linda. I can explain. I was young, I got into trouble, and they put me in there. When I got out and people found out where I'd been, they wouldn't hire me. So I changed my name. Left Karen mills behind. Yeah. Quite a girl, that Karen. Heard she torched her foster father. That fire... Was an accident. You're gonna pack your bags and leave. So does Jesse know about this? In case you haven't noticed, your dad likes me. Well, he doesn't know the truth about-- did you ever use my parents' bathroom? No. When you were taking care of Maggie, you never helped her with her bath? No. She wouldn't let anybody help her. You know that. What are you getting at? How did this get in the drain of my parents' bathtub? You killed my mother. Quicker... And with more mercy than when she killed me. What are you talking about? Reality, Linda... Reality. You see this? The horses, the stables? It's as much mine as it is yours, and I've as much right to be here as you do. You're my sister, Linda. Maggie was your mother? In name only. The state was my real mother. Now, you've ruined everything, Linda. I should have done you first. You know, when I first found Conner ranch, I thought of burning it down. But I've grown since my days at Carson. I've learned things like anger management now. And you people... Just lived your picture-book life up here. Oh, god, you're crazy. You didn't know my fucking name till this morning! Well, here I am, sis. Because of you, I have no place to go. Nowhere! Good-bye, Linda. Linda? Are you ok? Sh-sheriff Tom's gonna be mad. Come on, come on. You ok? God almighty, what happened? It's a long story. You'll never believe it. Susan-- Susan tried to kill Linda. What? He saved my life. Oh, baby. God, if only I'd listened to you, maybe this wouldn't have happened. Are you ok? Yeah, yeah. Hey, hey-hey. Ahh. Captioning made possible by trimark home video
