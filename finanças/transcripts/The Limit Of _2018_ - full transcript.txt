You've applied for a loan for 60,000 euro. Unfortunately, it has come back as a decline. Come back? From where? I thought you said it would be approved. Our lending department in head office has the final say. Their decision takes into account what is best for the bank, but also what is best for you. You know my husband has a tumour. He needs to go to the States. Our insurance doesn't cover the operation. And you think you know what's best for me? A loan is what's best for me. The decision is final, we've done everything we can. Maybe you can reapply in six months. He doesn't have six months. Let me just print off some lending policies you might find helpful. Gerard, would you mind? Sure. My daughter works here. Alison. She doesn't know about the insurance and I don't want her to. - Now. - Thank you. Now, Nora, this will give you some guidance. Morning. Morning. You don't talk much? I talk. Like a psychologist. Like a psychologist and a client. They talk every week, and yet the client always leaves never knowing anything about the psychologist. And you reckon I'm the psychologist? Maybe. I'm expensive. - Maybe I've money. - Okay. Let's talk. How was the sales figures last week? How was the holiday? Good. Spain was it? With some friends? Yeah, for a week, was nice to get away. You must have been hiding from the sun. Factor 40. You better get to work, big promotion coming up. You know he would be proud of you and your career. I'm sure he would. I better change the flowers.

I can't. ♪ Da-ra-ra-ba-ra-ra-ba ♪ ♪ Da-ra-ra-ba-ra-ra-ba ♪ ♪ Da-ra-ra-ba-ra-ra-ba ♪ ♪ Da-ra-ra-ba-ra-ra-ba ♪ ♪ Man worried about the big bomb flying ♪ ♪ Worried about the ocean rising ♪ ♪ Thinking on the day that he'll die And wonder if he were ever alive ♪ ♪ On the same day He saw the big blue sky ♪ ♪ It was the same day They were closing his eyes ♪ ♪ Da-ra-ra-ba-ra-ra-ba ♪ Actually there was a customer in at me yesterday. Reminded me of you. Her husband had something similar to what dad had. She needed money. Were you able to help? I know you did your best. Those blessed banks have a lot to answer for. Well, look who snuck out to help his dad, huh? Would you rather be out here in the cold helping your dad, or inside in the house looking after your mom? Mum, are you okay? Mum. Are you okay? Yeah, yeah, yeah, I'm fine. Stop, stop, stop, stop, I'll get it, I'll get that, I'll get that. Maybe I'll just go lie down. Okay. What are you going to do when your loved ones die? It's a hard question, but we've got to ask it. One in five people die before the age of 45. One in four people get cancer. Life Assurance, easy money for the bank's bottom line. So it's simple. We need more. Mike here, who is smashing all sales targets has agreed to share with us some of his secrets on selling life insurance. Mike. First of all I'll start by saying, when I sell I like to sell fear. The best way I can teach you all about how I sell life assurance is by example. A 34-year-old woman came into my office the other day, she brought her five-year-old son along with her. She was looking for a loan. There was no repayment capacity. Tough shit. Loan denied. Now you sat there in your seats looking at me, asking me, how did I turn this decline into a sale? This is where I feel visuals work best. So there in the office I drew her a picture. It's a picture of a happy family. It's a mother, it's a father and it's a five-year-old boy. But I left out one importance piece of information in this picture. It's the father died four years ago. Now, here's the psychological trick about women. Is they like to see themselves as independent people, who stand up for themselves, but if you take away the man in their lives, well, they can't help but feel alone. So I look at that woman one last time and I say to her, the question is, not whether you can afford to have life assurance, it's can you afford not to have it. She's emotional… I'm emotional. And I just made a sale! Because I sell fear. Well done. Well done, Mike. Thank you. You weren't nodding. Just now in the meeting. When the meeting ended, everyone else was nodding, but you weren't. Wasn't I? I thought I was. Anyway, that's not why you're here, is it? You're here for the business manager promotion. Opportunities like this do not come up often. You see this. This is great work. You're a real asset to us here, Alison. Unfortunately, taking everything into consideration, you are not the successful applicant for the position. Was there anything I could have done differently? Maybe work on your killer instinct. I will. Thank you for the consideration. I wasn't in Spain last week. I was on a rainy beach in the west of Ireland. My parent's friends own a caravan down there. I can't afford anything else. When my husband died, the mortgage, the bills, the car loan, everything was in my name. We're a nation of tea drinkers and they still make us drink shit tea. Open it. Jack. I'm on my way. Your mother has had a severe stroke. Most of her movements have been affected. She can still recognise you and understand you but… her ability to communicate is… gone. I'm sorry. She is going to need professional care, she is going to need a full-time nurse. And I can provide you with… with a list of the good care homes in the area. Sometimes there are warning signs and… with your mother's underlying health issues, I think stress can play a large part. Was she under any undue stress? Look, we'll keep her here for the next week and we'll reassess it then. Is that okay?

Sure. You haven't registered any sales this week. I just haven't logged them yet. So let's take a look at them now. In your office or… One second. The wife. Hello? I know. Okay. I'm sorry. Yeah. Front row. Centre seats. What? I know what I said. Yeah. Mm-hm. Right. Bye. Where were we? Oh, yeah, my office. Do you know what, make it after lunch. Just tea. Do you mind? And if I do? Thank you… for my stuff. You're not very good with people, are you? I'm good with people. When you have to be. People say you run at night… through the city. 2:00 a.m. 3:00 a.m. Do you? When I was a boy my dad was always my hero, I'd do anything he asked. But there was one particular saying he used for a lot of things. "Never show people your hard work." "Make everything look easy." So, no. I don't. Is there anything you want, sir? Not today. Thank you. I'm worried about your figures. This whole thing with your mother being sick is… it's unfortunate. But I really do think that the best thing for anyone at a time like this is to throw everything into work. The last thing you want is to fall behind. And of course you know, if there's anything at all that we can do for you, all you've got to do is ask and I'll make it happen, because that's what I do. There was one thing, I was thinking I'd book some holidays. When were you thinking? I'll put you on the board. Tomorrow. Yeah, tomorrow, it's… it's kinda short notice, you know. Yeah. Look, I'll check the board. Oh! Yeah. Mike is already off, golfing trip. I could maybe give you Friday week? Check again. Look, this is silly, yeah, I'm not entertaining this. What the fuck? Christ! Now… I won't be in tomorrow. - Sorry about that. - It's okay. So… tell me about yourself? Well, I've been a nurse for 15 years. Ten years public practice initially and then the last five years I've been in… I got all that from your CV. I'd like to get to know you. Of course. Well, I'm happily married for the last 15 years, to the wonderful Jim. We met in school would you believe. Um, most people call me Mags, I prefer that, I think Margaret's kind of, uh, formal. I have a son, Adam. He's repeating his junior cert at the moment. He failed his exams. But we're very proud. Why am I sitting here in front of you? I believe that when a parent or grandparent gets sick, they deserve the same love and care that they gave their family, every day of their life. She's all settled in. Must be nice to have her home. I thought I might give her a bath in a while.

What's on the 25th? It's my mum's birthday. You forgot that. Thank you. Who knows you're here? Nobody. And what do you want? I want in. I want money. There is no money. Unless you were declined a loan in the last five years, you won't be getting anything, and neither will I. I want 200,000. And then you'll get your chip back. You think this is about money? Don't be fake with me. There you go. Okay. Molly's still not eating. If it continues we could look at feeding her through a tube. I'm not feeding my mum through a tube. It's just an option, James. These will keep you warm. I saw them on sale and I thought of you. You're in. I'll see you tomorrow, I've to go take care of my lot. No rest for the wicked. See you in the morning, okay? You're doing great, just keep doing what you're doing. I've left two brownies in the fridge for you. I'll see you tomorrow, okay? You don't have to do this. You did this. No. I came down here to do a deal. I didn't think you'd act like some kind of psycho. Sit. Spread your legs. If I were driving down an open road and there was no other cars in sight and in the distance I see a girl, similar to you say, and I swerve, knocking her down, killing her, just in that moment of madness. I would instantly feel bad. A psycho wouldn't. You've got quite the sweet tooth. The brownies. I'll have to make more. I'd make them myself but it's not my forte. You'd have no teeth left. This is true. I was going to do shop, would you like something? Um, no, I'm grand. I'd say there's good drying out today. Yeah, it looks like it. You're back quick. Would you believe, I had the basket almost full and I realised I forgot my wallet. Did you put the food back? I forgot my wallet one day and I had to go round with all the food. So embarrassing going to all the different shelves. But I just couldn't leave it on the, on the ground. Now you're making me feel bad. - Are you going to go back in? - To put the food back? No, to pay for it. I'll go tomorrow. Okay. It's the only game I was allowed to play in the house as a kid. How does it work? It's pretty simple, I could show you. So… you throw the ball towards the floor, it bounces up, it hits in between the two windows, comes back and you catch it. - What if it hits one of the windows? - Well then, my mum will deal with you. And how do you win? It's a personal best type of game. Okay. Now, don't celebrate too early. Oh. - What did you do? - I celebrated too early. I'll get the ball. I better go. I have to get home, make dinner. It's gonna get better, okay? I can't stay here. My dad needs me. Your dad needs you to stay here. You're mum was in for a loan last week. And she was declined. Why was she looking for a loan? Your dad's insurance. It doesn't cover the treatment in America. Why wouldn't she tell me? Alison. Alison… Come Friday, three things are going to happen. The banks are going to be reminded that they are not invincible. You'll get to go home. And your dad will be okay. Okay. But you've to do something for me. I can't let you go. I know that. But you can bring me inside the house. There are people in the house. You figure it out. Morning. Sorry I'm late. Take a seat, Margaret. - Margaret? This sounds serious. - It is. Me and mum have been chatting and we feel that this isn't working out. What do you mean? This, you, working here. I don't understand? I know it's difficult to understand. Some people think they're really good. And don't get me wrong, you are good, but maybe you're just not as good as you think you are. Can I talk to you alone?

I even wrapped them myself. I bet they were good gifts. The best. You know they'll be looking for me? When all this happens tomorrow, I'll be the missing banker. And they'll want to know where I've been. Tell them you went to that caravan your parent's friend owns, that you turned off your phone. You wanted to be alone. But I don't want to be alone. Hello, Father… it's James Allen. I thought I'd wash. Get on the bed. I had to be sure. Today's the day. You tied your hair up? I found an elastic band. Where did you find it? It was just in the room. Where is it? Where's what? Where the fuck is it? In breaking news this morning INB bank, one of the states' big three, has suffered a major security breach in its computer operation. It appears that unknown hackers have managed to approve over 50,000 small to medium sized loans which the bank had previously declined. The loans, of amounts between 5 and 60,000 have been transferred automatically into the applicants individual accounts. Our financial correspondent Fergal Costello has more. Although none of the loan amounts were large, the effect of them being paid simultaneously has put enormous pressure onto the banks cash reserves. The most interesting legal question at the moment is whether INB can force their customers to repay these loans without the backing of a signed legal contract. A spokesperson for people before profit stated that given INB's aggressive reputation for selling, and it's willingness to foreclose on families suffering from mortgage arrears, it's hard to see how the Irish people will feel any sympathy for this particular bank.
