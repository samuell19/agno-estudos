What is that on the back of your hand, Caitlin Maguire? Relax, Dad. It's henna, okay? Pema's mom did it for the girls in class. We're studying Indian culture. Uh-huh. Indian culture? It washes off, right? Sort of, it will wear off. I got these. The girl at the store said they were the best ones. Gee. Thank you, Dad. You know I don't, uh... I don't take the SATs until next year. It's never too early to start preparing, right? Oh, hey can we stop at the store for, um, a couple of snacks? The boys are coming over after Mikey gets off work. So Mikey has a job, huh? Yeah, uh, not everyone at my school's a rich snob, Dad. Mikey's on scholarship and he washes dishes at Denny's. Have you finished with your term paper? - Totally. - Totally? All right. Um, it's almost done. I just have to proof it and print it. I want that paper done before your two little buddies come over. Otherwise you'll never finish. Alea iacta est. What? The die is cast. It's from Julius Caesar. You know, that thing that I've been working on for the past six weeks? "The Die is cast." That's impressive. You got the date locked? Next Saturday. Caitlin's gonna love it. The band's booked, she's got the whole place to herself. Okay, good. Caitlin's sweet 16. Damn, makes me feel old. Um, what are we gonna do with the, uh, the booze? Don't worry about it. I told the bartenders and waitresses no booze, not a drop. Okay. Did you talk to the doormen? No meth at the door. Your doormen sell meth? Don't worry about it. If I hear of anyone even looking at Caitlin's friends funny, I'll kick their asses myself. No, no. Wait a minute. These are 16-year-old kids, Kane. I don't want any incidents. Talking about 16-year-olds drinking and doing drugs like we're role models? How much trouble did we used to get into when we were their age? I seem to remember you double-dipping Betsy, the one with lazy eye. That's right. Yeah, yeah. Yeah, right. Wasn't she your girl for a while? She was for a while, until they find out this badass was knocking his backdoor out. Well, hey, we shared the same honey pot, right? It makes us milk brothers. Romulus and Remus. Well, this is what I don't understand. How would you remember who you bang? I mean, you've been drinking a fifth of scotch a day since you were born? If you had a dad as mean as mine, you would. I’m gonna throw a great party. - You're a great dad. - All right. I got to run. Take it easy, Paulie. Uh, Mr. Mayor, Mr. Mayor, Mr. Mayor... Can you please tell us how many jobs will be provided on this project? Yes. Phase one has already created more than 100 jobs, local jobs for this community. And today, we begin phase two. And phase two means that we'll have a park as well as a river walk. Uh, Mr. Maguire, what do you intend to do with the profits? Uh, thank you, Frank. Uh, the mayor and I feel that this project will certainly stimulate the economy and, uh, we intend to put the money back into education and medical. Thank you. Thank you all for coming. Babe, are you almost ready? We're gonna be late for dinner with the Thompsons and Dean White. What does Dean White do exactly? He works for the governor. I think he's gonna run for State Controller. Good guy to know. We're gonna need a few extra contacts. Do you prefer the Noir tonight or the Portofino? Noir. You know, Princeton is nearly $40,000 a year and that's not including room and board. I know. Can we swing it? I got it covered. "We've" got it covered. We're a team here, right? - Yes, we are a team, but she's... - No. No "buts". None of this, "She's my daughter" bullshit, all right? I love the two of you and I'm here for you both. You got it? You know, you're very sexy when you put me in my place. Is this you changing the subject? I don't think, we have time for this. You are such a tease. I'm gonna go check on the little hellion. Caitlin, you're gonna be staying home tonight, right? Yeah. We're just hanging out here. Good, because you have a lot of homework that needs to be done by Monday and you need to focus on your work. - Okay, Dad. - I’m serious. Dad, I know. Listen, we're just gonna hang out here, watch TV or something. Ah, Lisa might stop by. But, that is it. Michael, I hear you're a working man? - Yes, sir. - And how is that working out for you? Well, it sucks, you know. But it's nice earning a buck or two and it's pretty flexible, you know. This summer, if you want to make some real money, you let me know, I can put you on one of my crews. Swinging a hammer pays a hell of a lot more than working at Denny's. You'd do that for me? Yeah, if you give me a hand with one of these boxes over here. Yeah, sure. Yeah, come on. Pfft! So are you gonna ask my daughter out? - What? - I see the way you look at her. Uh, I didn't think you would let her go out, you know. - You smoke weed? - No. - No drugs at all? - No. Well, then I might be willing to make an exception for a working man. Do you think she'd say yes? Mind of a woman is a mysterious thing, I can't tell you what she'll say, but... Fortune favors the bold. - You ready? - Yeah, almost. Go start the car, I'll be right there. Caitlin, I'm not your mother. I'm not gonna lecture you about smoking, although, you shouldn't be smoking. But the last time you and your friends hung out, Paul found cigarette butts in the backyard and I took the heat for it. - He believe you? - Probably not. But that's not the point. The look he gave me... I know the look. - So you understand? - Yeah. Yeah, Vanessa. Um, I'll be good. I promise. Thank you. You guys have a good night. She's so hot. Dickhead. I think the dock area is the perfect place to build. That part of town is just screaming for redevelopment. Huh? Heard you have a lot going on in redevelopment. How'd you get started in the business, Mr. Maguire? Uh, it's getting late, it's already past midnight, I'm sure everybody would like to go home and get some rest. Paul doesn't like to brag, but the truth of the matter is he built his first development himself. Lot of hard work. - That's what I've heard. - Well, I had a full crew with me, but, uh, yeah, my first job was swinging a hammer. I tend to drive my foreman a little crazy, but there's nothing that satisfies like a... An honest day's work. Love a guy that's not afraid to roll his sleeves up and get his hands dirty. Here's to an honest day's work. To an honest day's work. They're coming to get you, Barbara. Stop it. Hey, uh, my dad kind of likes you. - It's funny. - Yeah. Mike, go work for the big guy, get in good with the family, next thing you know, you're marrying Caitlin, taking over the business, you'll be a made man in no time. Cut it out, man. Detective, you're here for dinner? - Paul, we need to talk. - What seems to be the problem? I'm sorry, but it's urgent. This is not the time or the place. Whatever this is, surely we can discuss it in the morning. Hey, Paul, listen to me, this is not about you, it's about Caitlin. They called it in about an hour ago, Michael and that other boy, Evan. We sent him to the hospital and got him sedated. He was really shaken up. What this Michael kid told us, is that all three of them were together when it happened. They were playing video games and had a few drinks. No! They said that Caitlin tried to get away. They say that she put up a hell of a fight. This can't be happening. What about the neighbors? They see anything? Uh, nothing. I mean, who would break into your house, grab your daughter, and there's no ransom demands, nothing? I don't know, I don't have a problem with anyone right now. Right now. But think about your past. Who would have the inclination to do this? I know you still talk to O'Connell. This is my daughter! I would tell you if I had any idea who was behind this! - Would you? - Pete, I'm out of the game, you know that. How long have we known each other? Since the massacre at the Four Peas. - Yes. Fifteen years, Pete. - Yeah. I know you. Right, you do. You know me. I just don't want you falling back on any of your old habits. Let us handle this our way. All right, Paul? Okay fine. What's your way? Oh, we drop it on the news right away. With the emphasis on your history. Great. How many times do we have to tell you that he's clean? One or two things is going down here, the kidnappers either know you or they don't. If they don't, then the fear of just who they're messing with is our best asset. Once they hear, they'll probably drop her off at a gas station somewhere and she's back by lunch tomorrow. - If they know me? - They'll be in contact. And we'll be there. We have a tap on your phone. Either myself or Detective Hanson. We'll be here at all times. Paul, we'll find her. You better. Why, Paul? - Why Caitlin? You didn't... - You too. I'm sorry. I just... If I had any idea who did this... Just one... You find her. Do what you have to do, whatever it takes. You just bring her home. Two unidentified male classmates were injured in that home invasion. They're expected to make a full recovery. Caitlin Maguire is 5'6", 105 pounds, long, brown hair and blue eyes. If you have any information that could help in the investigation and the search for Caitlin... Move! Let's go. Move! Move! Get in! - I'm gonna go out. - Go out? I can't just sit here, waiting for the phone to ring, knowing she's out there somewhere, scared. And I'm supposed to stay here all by myself? There's cops all over the house. That's not what I meant. Please, be safe, okay? Where are we off to? Hey, it'd be best if you just stayed here by the phone. Shouldn't you be out somewhere looking for my daughter? We're doing everything we can. So am I. Paul, I'm so sorry. Eleanor, please, I need to speak with your son. Wow. Look at all these awards. You know, I started dating Mary when I was 17. That was Caitlin's mom, Mary. You're 17, right? Yeah. I remember, once we were on this date down by the shore, summer time, hot as shit, just wouldn't cool off. Anyway, this Puerto Rican looking shithead comes walking down the beach, calls Mary a slut. You believe that shit? Calling a nice Irish Catholic girl like that a slut, well... Needless to say, I had to defend her honor because that's what gentlemen do. They protect women. So I went and I got the tire iron out of the trunk of my car and I broke both his legs. I'm not like that anymore. Now I've changed. You see, 'cause, when Mary got sick, um, stage four, breast cancer, swore I'd go legit so that there'll always be at least one parent around to take care of Caitlin. He had guns. I would expect you to get shot trying to protect her. Now I want you to think hard. What did they sound like? What? The kidnappers, did they have an accent? - Uh... - Did they sound Russian? Puerto Rican? Did they use any weird slang? Did they sound like goombas? I don't know. Okay, what did they smell like? Spicy food? Too much cologne? Come on, Mike, you have got to give me something. If anything happens to my daughter, I'm holding you personally responsible. I don't know, I'm sorry. I don't know. It was all so fast, I messed up, you know. I wish I could have done something, I wish I'd been brave... I wish it was me, okay? I'm sorry. If you remember anything, you give me a call. You got it? Yes, sir. Hey, it's me. I need some help. Will you meet me at the construction site? We're sorry. We'll find the scrotes who did this, Paulie. You got my word on it. I know you're still in with O'Connell, right? - Yup. - All right. You remember that stint I pulled inside not too long ago? Did my time, kept my mouth shut, bumped me up. I need guys I can trust. Cops are keeping very close tabs on me, so I understand if you don't want to get involved with this, but I... I... I do need some help. Say the word. I wanna find her, I wanna find who took her, and, uh... They're dead, Paulie, you just don't know it yet, all right? There's $200,000. Use what you need to get any information, and just keep the rest, okay? We can't take that, we're family. You'd do the same thing for us, Paulie. - We'll do anything you ask. - I know. But this could get dirty. Just how deep do you want this go? How deep is hell? I know just where to look. This guy's a rat but he knows me. Just hang back and follow my lead, all right? Geez, an elevator would have been nice. Knock, knock, asshole. Oh, shit! - Slow down, slow down. - I didn't steal anything. Come on, I swear. You know I wouldn't mess with you, Doherty. - Come on. - No, no, no, no. Shh, relax, relax. I know you wouldn't do that, all right? You're too smart for that. I got one question to ask you, all right? Who kidnapped Paul Maguire's daughter? Take a good look. You heard anything? Nothing, I swear. If I knew I would tell you, come on. Now who would mess with Maguire, anyway? Hold still. My, my, my... Mmm... I'm not happy with what I see here, Oliver. What's he doing, man? I'll bet you were his sweet little BL, huh? Before he got you all jacked up. Come here, darling. Come here. That's it. Easy now. Let's just put her down. Put her down. - What are you doing? - Come on, my little princess. Am I your little princess? I got a pretty little princess necklace here for you, too. You don't know anything about the girl, huh, Oliver? Nothing, I swear! Start talking, Oliver! Please, please, look, whatever it is that you are about to do... Don't, please. Come on. No. Tell me about the girl, Oliver. Look, please, if I knew I would tell you! Come on, don't hurt her! Come on, please. Please, no. No, please. Don't hurt her. Listen to me. Is there a girl being held somewhere? I don't know! I don't know! Jesus, tell him, I don't know. No, no, no, no, no, no! Talk to me, Oliver. No, please. I love her. No... - What's that? - I love her, man. No, no, no, no. Simone? Get up. I need you. Now I believe you. See you around, Oliver. Jesus, I can't believe I hit that rope. What? You never done that shit before? Hell, no. I thought for sure she was going for a two-storey swan-dive. - You're one horrible guy. - Yeah, right, right. You're a saint, huh? Nobody's seen or heard anything. How is that possible? Paulie, we've been rattling jaws all night long. Whoever took her is keeping their shit tight. I got feelers out everywhere. Somewhere, someone has to mess up. All right. Paul, we found her. The roses all have left your cheeks I've watched them fade away and die Your voice's... Thank you for your beautiful song. So sorry. - I'm sorry. - Thank you for coming. So sorry, my friend. - Vanessa, this is... - Francis O'Connell. Hi, I'm Vanessa. I'm Paul's wife. - Pleased to meet you. - Call me Frank. If you don't mind, Frank, I have, uh, some things that I'd like to tend to at the house. I'll see you later. Can we take a walk? You've done really good for yourself, Paulie. I'm proud of you. Smoke and mirrors, Francis. That's not what I heard. You got a nice, big house over there by the country club, aye? And the beautiful wife. You know, Paul, the present situation aside... You've got yourself one hell of a life, don't you agree? Huh? Is this going somewhere? Things have settled down, the business is more civilized than it used to be. In the good old days, you remember, the gutters were running red, huh? You remember that night at the Four Peas? And what those Russian faggots did to me? Of course. But do you remember what I told you? Because you wanted to rush in and kill them all. You said we lost too many already. Exactly. I don't know what this has to do with anything. My neck, it's hurting to look up to you like this. Do you mind sitting down? That's better, eye to eye. That's the thing I miss the most, I guess, to be able to stand over somebody and stare him down. Those simple, small things in life that I'm not able to do anymore. You know, like banging a young broad or kicking somebody's teeth down their throat. But do I lash out, Paulie? Do I show my weakness? No. I bury it a long time ago. I bury the hurt. Just like you have to bury yours. Hey, I'm not finished! Sit down. I'm listening. Yeah. You better be listening because I know you. And know this unpleasantness is eating at you. And you're determined to do something about it. I'm asking you, don't. Let the cops do their job. Hmm? Things are good. I want them to stay that way. Right? Things don't look so good from where I am, Francis. If you won't listen to reason, can you listen to a friend? I did you a big favor when I let you walk out. I didn't have to, you know that. But I did. I let you walk out. It's not everyday someone can just walk out of the business clean as you could. But you could. You know why? Because you came to me and you asked me. I did you a favor. And now I want you to repay me by doing nothing. Let it go away, Paulie. Bury the hurt. You understand me? Yeah. I understand. Does, uh, anybody want cream? No, thanks. I'm good. Your friend Sheila still come around? Uh... I don't know what we're gonna do with all the food. So... Honey, do you mind? I want to know. No. Really, you don't. Hey. She's a peach, that wife of yours. So what's the word? No word. O'Connell not only said to stay out of it but to keep an eye on you, too. So, what now? You still have someone inside the force, someone who won't report back to your boss? I do. I can have him check into the case. I didn't want to bring this up because... We're not supposed to bring it up. No, no, no, no. That was a long time ago. We did everything right. Are you sure? Hold on, get in! Let's go! Let's go! - Where is the key? - Where is the key? I can cut this. - No! No! No, you can't! - Where is the key, asshole? What have you done? Don't kill me! No! No! No! This is your mess. You clean it up. No, we... We did everything right. Jesus. Tell me about it. How was it that a man with this many past criminal associations can turn legitimate business man and I can't get a re-file on my mortgage? I... I mean, look at this. Irish mob, Russian mob. About 20 suspects, and no leads. When have you ever known a criminal to just go clean? No arrest doesn't mean no activity. Maybe he's just been careful. No. I just talked with him a few days ago. And he's a wreck. If he was still dirty, he'd know who did this. This ought to help narrow down the suspect list. It's the ballistics on the Maguire girl. 7.62 millimeter. Fired from a Soviet-made Tokarev TT-33. Well, it gets worse. It crossed against three hits tied to the Chernov family. One in 1983 and two in 1988. What does that tell you? That whoever killed her, hadn't killed anyone for a long damn time. At least not with that gun. This stays here. Mr. Maguire. I'm... I'm really very sorry for your loss. Caitlin was... She was really something else. Yes, she was. She worked really hard on that. I just thought that... Of course. I'll read it tonight. Mr. Maguire. Would you like to collect Caitlin's belongings from her locker? You sure it's Chernov? No, I'm not sure. But whoever did it, he used a Russian gun. It was 20 years ago. How could they know about us? How? They took his daughter, you think that's coincidence? Yeah, well, I never talked. You never talked. I'm certain Paul never talked. So, how would anybody know? This whole mess just stinks. Do you want me to tell him? No, I'll tell him. - Hey. - Hi. Is he in? Maybe he'll talk to you. You Okay? Fine. I know it's hard. Just because she wasn't my blood doesn't mean she wasn't my daughter, you know. She loved you. Thank you. Stay strong. He's upstairs. Hey. That was when she was four. What have you heard? Ballistics. Yes? You wanna get out of here? So, what does that mean exactly? How someone like you got as far as you did in the organization without knowing his guns... Knives are quieter. I like knives. Tokarev TT-33. It's an old army sidearm. HL clip. And it's favored in the Russian mafia. Jesus. Yeah, the Russians. Could have been a hit. Could have been a smaller faction just looking for some ransom money. Not one of them takes a shit without Chernov's permission. We never asked permission to rob the Russian. We don't talk about that. I keep trying to get Vanessa to stay someplace safe, but she won't listen. She won't go. So, what do you wanna do? Call Danny. It's like old times, fellas. Let's do this, huh? You're not understanding us. We have a lot of money to spend and we wanna play some cards. Clearly you have a problem understanding English. We wanna play cards. - We wanna play cards. - Nyet. Private. No, that is not what I said. What I said is that we have a lot of money to spend and we wanna play some cards. Okay? Okay, let us in. Hey. Hey, hey, hey- We need you to move, partner. Speak English. I speak three languages. How many do you speak? Stupid men. Well, that got their attention. They're gonna come gunning for us. Sure as shit. Always the best way to gain information when it's hard to come by. Just stir the pot and they'll come looking for you. Just be ready. We'll be ready. Look, Danny, the shit's about to get radical. We gotta cover each other. Relax, all right? We got this. Not one of your cocaine parties. Really? You gotta go there, Paulie? What is it with you and my partying anyway, huh? All right. Let's just relax, okay? All right? Jesus, Paulie. - What is this? - You know exactly what this is. It is not safe for you to be here anymore! Tell me what happened. Please don't shut me out. I wanna know... What? What would you really wanna know? Huh? What do you wanna know? You wanna know how many people I jacked up last night? How loud the screams were? - No, I... - Then what? Is it over? It's just beginning. I'm not leaving. I need you, you need me. You told me to do whatever it takes, right? Well, this is what it takes. Pack your bags. Then I was wrong. Then I should've kept my mouth shut. But you didn't! Now, I'm in this. Sorry if it upsets you. Yeah. That upsets me. My husband is a killer. I think... You're enjoying this. Say "My husband's a killer." Come on. Repeat after me. "My husband is a killer." You've always known it. Just haven't seen it until now. Is that... ls that what's going on? Is that why you're still here, 'cause it turns you on? Huh? - All right? - You got me. - Anything? - Nothing. All right. We up the stakes. What are you thinking? We need a vory. Let me make a quick call. Beautiful. Yeah. Just take 'em into the back room. Keep 'em occupied for us, sweetheart. We'll be right over. Yeah. You, too, easy now. Amber's got a vory over at the club. She's gonna take him to the back room for us. Just in case they're packing. All right. All three of us going here is gonna look suspicious as hell, all right? So you two sit tight, and I'll go in and bring this prick out. I got this. Hi. You can't shoot people in the street! You know who I am? What? You're nothing to me. Hey! Do you know me, huh? Nineteen years ago I threw you from a car. I stole your boss's money. Remember that? In the mask. Chernov thought I took the money. He tortured me for two days. I lost these fingers because of you. Someone put a bullet in my daughter's head with a Russian handgun. Who did it, huh? What, was it Chernov, huh? Somebody acting out of turn? Who was it? Who did it? Who did it? No, no, no, no, don't die. Don't. Don't. Don't die, don't die. No, no! Don't... Who did it? Who did it? Who did it? Who did it? Who did it? Who did it? Who did it? Who did it? A cup of coffee, please. Thank you. I'm here. What do you want? You can't go around tearing up the city. This isn't good for anyone. Don't know what you're talking about. Look, man. This isn't gonna bring your kid back. I feel you, what you're going through. But if this keeps up, I promise you I'm gonna find a way to put you and your crew away for good. Shit. Paul. A few years ago, my... My kid, Robbie, he was riding his bike on 6th Street and got hit by a car. I get to emergency, it's touch and go. Then poor kid is in surgery. And I felt I needed to do something, anything. Found out where the guy lived. I see his fender, mangled, where he hit my boy. I must have stood an hour at the edge of that driveway. Gun in my hand. Finally, I cooled myself down. I go back to the hospital. Robbie pulls through. A few days later, I went down to 6th Street. There was construction going on. It was a blind spot. And I realized at that moment that that accident could've happened to anyone. If I had killed that man, it wouldn't have changed a thing. Your kid is still alive. Anything else? Hold on, bitch. You! Put your weapon down! On the floor now! Down! Hey. Andre! Andre! Andre! You son of a... It's okay. You'll be dead soon. But first... You're gonna talk. Yes, sir. Somebody put one hell of a dent in Chernov's drug operation. Uh, I didn't even start to think about that mess at the Russian joint. Six gold cross. Chernov's men, huh? Meet Sasha Borat. Rap sheet as long as my dick. Cutting off fingers. Somebody's trying to sniff out a secret. I have a pretty good idea who. What is it? Someone enter our house. Victor and Sasha are dead. Find whoever did this. And bring them directly to me. What's this world coming to, huh? When I was a young man, we used to settle our disputes with this. Words were exchanged before gunshots. People knew what was coming to them and why. These days they shoot first. There is no rationale, no protocol. Nothing but blood and confusion. How am I supposed to know what these men want? Shit! Hello. An SUV on my street. Big bunch of Russian guys have just gotten out. How long will it take you and Doherty to get over. I thought he was with you. No, man, he's not with me. Just make it fast. Come on. Get up. Oh! God damn it, Danny! Pick up! They got Kane. Danny! Go! Go! Go! What the hell is wrong with you? Me? What the hell is wrong with you? - Cuff him. - Come on. Get off him. Get off. Are you trying to kill everyone in this city? Look at me. Go to hell. What the hell's going on, Maguire? This asshole let the kidnappers get away. We'd like to ask you a few questions concerning your whereabouts last night. I'm trying to help you here. You got clean once. Do it again. Walk away. Let us do our job. We'll find who killed your daughter. I promise you, Paul. It's our top priority. Bullshit! I knew you heard about the ballistic report. Personally, a couple of dead vory brightens my clay. So, why are they after you? What did you do? Did you piss someone off? Can I go now? Sir, are you serious? I'll take care of this. You're gonna let him walk? Thanks, Peter. I owe you one. Hey, Paul, watch your back, man. Mr. Kane. You know who I am, don't you? Not personally, no. We've never met. Well, your name is Chernov. And you're the bad guy. That is quite funny coming from someone responsible for the death of several of my men. Can you offer me an explanation for your behavior? Please. Explanation? I should be asking you the same thing. Anton, please, allow me to handle this. Maybe a little water will help loosen your tongue. Drink up. There. I don't have to explain things. Huh? Others do the explaining. I ask questions and you answer them. Understand? Yeah, sexy. I like that. I totally could do that. Tell the stripper to leave, Danny. Paulie, what's up, buddy? Where were you, Danny? Get out. Grab your stuff and get out. What's up? You didn't check your phone? I was just blowing off a little steam with Amber. Why aren't you at your house? 'Cause you don't bang strippers in your home. What's going on? - They got Kane. - Oh, Jesus! You didn't answer your phone. Yeah. I told you I was having fun. I... All this action, I couldn't wind down. I needed a release. While you were getting high and getting your dick wet, they got Kane. Paulie, look, look... Let me get you a drink, all right? How's your bladder feeling? Full? Why are you killing my men? Why would you be so stupid, huh? What could you possibly have to gain? I can do it much longer than you can. Caitlin Maguire. Who? You killed Caitlin Maguire, Paul Maguire's daughter, that's the truth. The reformed criminal who lost his daughter? He thinks I did it? He knows you did it. That is a terrible accusation. Why would I kill the little girl? Why would I do such a thing? She was killed with a Russian gun. Tokarev. You're not looking so good, Mr. Kane. I can stop if you like. Why? Revenge. We hit the bagman for the money. We cut his hand off. We killed him. We were kids. You killed Ivan? You killed my brother? You started that war. Call that gimp, O'Connell. When was your stint? Four years ago I got out. You spent how long inside? What difference does it make? Just answer the question. How long? Five years on an eight-year sentence. - Aggravated assault, possession. - Right. Yeah, I remember when it went down. It was all over the papers. Crate full of Israeli submachine gun and all you got was possession. Plea bargain? No. - I don't like what you're getting at. - What am I getting at? - Paulie... - No one here has one clue who killed my daughter. Not one. Tore up all those Russians last night, not a single one of them knew anything. If they did, they would have cracked. So you tell me, what am I getting at? Paulie, I did not rat. And you know I wouldn't rat. It was the driver. He didn't know shit. Never saw our faces. Never knew what hit 'em. - Paulie, listen to me... - You just shot him. So now we'll never know, right? Paulie, you got to listen to me. All right? - Just listen to me. - Uh-huh. - The whole reason I'm back with O'Connell... - Uh-huh. - ...is because I didn't drop the dime... - Uh-huh. - ...on nobody. - Uh-huh. - I got the light rap... - Uh-huh. ...because they misplaced some of the evidence. Uh-huh. But still you went down nine years ago. So that was what? That was two, three years after we split the cash? Okay, so what are you getting at? The weapons you got caught with... Did you use the money to buy them? And don't lie to me. Yeah, of course, I did. What the hell! What's the big deal? What's the big deal? They took Caitlin and they shot her in the head. Maybe... Maybe that's not a big deal to you, but it's a pretty fucking big deal to me. And the only reason they would do something like that is if someone talked. No one asked you? No one asked you where you got the money for those guns? O'Connell didn't wanna know how you managed - to pull off something like that on your own? - Paulie. - Yeah? - I’ve always been loyal. You've always been an idiot. Screw you, Paulie. Nothing's ever your fault. There's always someone else to blame. Always someone there to bail you out. Who... Who's bailing you out now, huh? Whose man are you now? Are you... Are you my man? - Are you Chernov's man? - Hey! - Are you O'Connell's man? - Easy, Paulie. Easy. - Knock it off, won't you? I didn't rat! - You talked! - I didn't rat! - You spilled your guts to your boss to take care of you and make those guns go away. - That's not what happened. - And then O'Connell talked. - It's not what you think. - And now my daughter is dead. We swore not to talk about it. Not to spend the money. Not to draw attention to ourselves. - I'm not a rat. - You are a rat. - Rat! Rat! Rat! - Shut up! Shut up! Shut up! You... You swore. Paulie, shit, man! I loved you. And you swore. Danny. Come on, Danny. Danny. You got to get up, man. Get up, Danny. Danny. I'll miss you. What is so damn important you had to pull me away from my nephew's football game? Anton. I believe that belongs to you. No, hasn't been mine for many, many years. I have no responsibility. Responsibility, huh? When I was 19 years old, I was the number one light heavyweight champion in the Soviet Olympic boxing team. Did you know this? No, I don't like sports. Especially not Soviet sports. I had a shot at number one. I could have been the champion except my father had a little problem. He was a pathetic gambler. When he could no longer pay his debt, the Russian mob, the Bratva placed the burden on my shoulders. I could clear his debt by taking a fall by losing to the champion. What do you think I did? I don't have a clue. Fill me in. "I don't have a clue." I took a beating for my father. I lost for him. No child should have to pay for their father's sins. But the Bratva took me in. Gave me a new life. When my father fell for the debt again, who do you think they sent to collect? Me! My father failed just as your man here failed you. I told you he's not mine any longer. Are you deaf? You know the Maguire fellow? The one in the news. The one whose daughter been killed, huh? What about him? He was the one who killed my brother. He was the one who started the war between us. The one who landed you in that chair. So, you see, I invited you here to ask you to do one thing for me. Take responsibility. Let me make one thing clear. I don't take orders from people like you. Russian scumbag! Do what you have to do, whatever it takes. Tokarev TT-33. It's an old army sidearm. It's favored in the Russian mafia. Don't kill me! No! No! No! Evan. Evan. What was so important? I'm sorry, Mike. - What? - I’m sorry. It was an accident. Don't! Please! I didn't mean to. Come on. You have to believe me. No! No, please. Please, no. Okay. We were hanging out. And drinking is normal. And talking about, uh... About how you used to be a gangster. So where does he keep the loot, huh? Shut up! Come on. How many times do I have to tell you, guys? My dad is... Is a legitimate business man. - Well, he is. - Yeah, has he ever been arrested? Hmm. Maybe you should ask him when he gets home. Uh, no. Honestly, he... He kind of scares the shit out of me. Have you ever seen or heard anything like secret phone calls or wads of cash sitting around. - Wait. Did you see that? - Totally. - Did you see that? - Come on. You know something. Something cool. Spill it. Caitlin, please. - All right. - Serious? Yeah. Yeah, I'll show you something. Yes! We went upstairs. She... She said she had something cool to show us. I never held a gun before, you know. It was scary and cool. And I know I should have put it down. But I didn't. I'm coming to get you, assholes. Woo-hoo! Evan, come on. Don't make me chase you. - Come on, let's go. - It's raining. So, what? It's rain. Afraid you'll melt? All right. - Come on, Evan, we got to put 'em back. - Bam! Bam! Bam! No! It's not even loaded. Don't be an asshole. Come on. Hand it over. Fine, buzz kill. Gee! Jesus! You too? All right. Hand it over. - Oh, God! - No! No! No! No! No! No! Oh, shit! No! I didn't hear her coming. I wasn't paying attention. I was a little drunk and the gun was so cool, you know. And it felt... I didn't know she was gonna be right behind me. I... It was an accident. I didn't know what to do. We dragged her into the woods. We put the guns back. We trashed the house to make it seem like a home invasion. I figured with your history the cops would think it was a mob hit or something. I'm so sorry. I didn't wanna kill her. I was scared. I was scared. I loved her, I swear to god. I loved her so much. Please, say something. Just end this. Please. I can't take it anymore. Please. Baby. Hi. It's okay, now. It's all over. - It's good to hear your voice. - Come home. You're gonna be safe now. Are you okay? You sound so, um... I killed a man when I was 17. Caitlin's age. I got into a fight. Someone handed me a knife. Sometimes I dream about that night. In the dream I see myself and I try to stop it but I can't. Then I wake up and I wonder what would have happened if no one handed me that knife. What my life... What our lives might have been. Paul... I'm sorry I let you down. Paul! Paul?
