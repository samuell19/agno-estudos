[upbeat music] [birds chirping] Honey! Honey! Kenneth, when we get back to the States, remind me to strangle our travel agent. -Baby... -Barbara. Right, look, this is first class. Most people go to the back country by truck. Honey, look at that. [trumpeting] More hunting talk. I thought we were on our honeymoon. Honey, listen, when I bag you that white tiger, you're gonna be the envy of our whole gang. You mean the envy of your gang. My gang hunts at Bloomingdale's. Honey, relax. Meyer's taken care of everything. He's outfitted some of the finest safaris in the world. Hemingway was a guest at his lodge, and as far as guides go, Meyer's promised us the best, the most experienced, the most cunning guide in the whole jungle. [upbeat music] Sinaga... Sinaga! Under your pillow. Oh. [gargling] [adventurous music] [music continues] Bwana, Bwana, Buck's boat is here. -Oh, he's here. -He is, come on. [speaking native dialect] [speaking French] What is going on? [speaking French] Let him go. Pay the man. [indistinct chatter] [haunting melody] How the hell did I get into this again? Remember last week? That lady. No. Oh, yeah. Che, sorry, honey. I guess she was worth it. Do yourself a favor, Sinaga. Get over to Meyer and get yourself a bet down on him. Then who's going to bet on you? What was your name again? Argo! Uh-huh, isn't that a restaurant on the corner of Columbus and San-- [yells] [gasping] [all cheering] [grunting] [grunting] [cheering] [cheering] [all cheering] [cheering] [upbeat music] [all cheering] [cheering] [upbeat music] [gasping] [grunting] Shit. [screaming] [all cheering] [sighing] Sinaga! Thank you. I ought to learn how to land. How does Chuck Norris land? Magnificent, Buck, Buck. Oh, I'm so proud of you. Bravo! I never doubted you for a moment, Buck. Yeah, right, right, right. [speaks foreign language] Buck, I've taken the liberty, Buck, of looking over your croc hides. Quite acceptable. [Buck] Acceptable? Those are the best crocs you've seen all year. -[Meyer] How much? -[Buck] Three thousand. I'm pleased to hear the jungle hasn't dulled your sense of the... absurd. Fifteen hundred. [yelling] Americans, such competitors. Make it 22 in honor of our longstanding friendship. Make it 25, and you clear my bar tab. Oh, Buck, I wish I had more time for this sport. Perhaps one day we will continue negotiations on your amulet. I told, you it's not for sale. [ship's horn] [Meyer] And now, if you'll excuse me, I must go meet the boat. I'm expecting a couple for an extended safari. Don't worry, Meyer, I won't scare off your pigeons. Maki! Maki? Yeah, pet name. I think I'll go enjoy the spoils of victory. [upbeat music] [gasping] [screaming] [gasping] Wave, wave, come on. Smile! Over here! Wave, wave. This is great! Mr. and Mrs. Manchester. -Mr. Meyer, I presume? -Oh, Wolfgang Meyer. -Ken. -Kenneth. And you must be baby. -Barbara. -Barbara. Welcome, welcome. My father spoke of you often. Oh, yes, I remember him well. He was quite a sportsman, your father. [Ken] He was. Oh, let me introduce you to your guide. Hali, this are Ken and Baby. -Hi. -Nice to see you. We'll have good luck. I guarantee it. That's great. I've done a lot of bragging Stateside, and sure don't want to go back home with egg on my face. -Egg? On your face? -Yeah! I'm sure you won't be disappointed. Perhaps you'd like to freshen up a bit. Yes. Well, you'll find the hotel fully equipped and the staff most eager to please. [trumpeting] [trumpeting] Wonderful. It reminds me of Lacoste. Hey, be careful, you idiot! Minus ten points. I'm sorry, this will be corrected. Yeah, see that it is. [gasping] Jesus, that's gotta hurt. I can assure you, this will not happen again. I bet. [trumpeting] [trumpeting] [upbeat music] [trumpeting] [trumpeting] [screaming] [trumpeting] [screaming] [trumpeting] [speaking native dialect] I know, I know. I know. Don't worry. [speaking native dialect] Smile, baby, smile. That a girl. [Ken] Who shot it? You! That was the most fantastic shot -I've ever seen. -Thank you. How did you get the bullet so perfectly in the brain pan? He's got a lucky amulet. Right. Wait a minute, wait just a gosh darn minute. What? -You're Buck Malone. -Yeah. Holy Geez. I saw you speak at the Explorer's Club in San Francisco. I'm Ken Manchester. My father's Stewart Manchester, you gotta remember him. Your wife looks like she's having it pretty rough. You better check on her, I think. Oh! [speaking native dialect] All right, all right, all right, all right, all right. [gasping] So much for his promise of good luck. Oh, that's cold. Buck, my friend, that was some of the finest shooting I've seen in a long time. -You're under arrest. -What? Killing an animal within village boundaries. The owner wants to file charges. I saved this woman's life. As village Magistrate, I'm afraid I'll have to insist. Oh, bullshit! But as the village Governor, I'm awarding you the medallion of bravery. I'll bring it over the stockade. [Buck] Thanks a lot. Don't mention it. Nice to meet you, folks. You call this a vacation? Thank God I brought my Neutrogena. You can't say it's not exciting. So is a train wreck. Come on, nothing happened. Oh, no, just a beating, a dead local, an elephant rampage. And our guide, he seemed so sweet. Where are we gonna get another one? That's Meyer's problem. -[Barbara] What are you doing? -[Ken] Nothing, honey. Who was that guy? The one that shot the elephant. [Ken laughing] That guy is Buck Malone. Tennessee Buck. Probably the greatest hunter in the world. He looked a little run down, though. The booze probably finally got him. Didn't seem to bother his shooting. What do you think is gonna happen to him? Hey, I've seen this sort of thing before. They're all pirates. Probably just sort it out amongst themselves. Meanwhile... I'm stranded... at the Bamboo Hilton... All alone... Soapy. -I wonder if he'd do it. -Do what? Buck Malone'd make a great guide. I'm sure Meyer can find a better replacement than some washed-out rummy. I mean, why not? He knows the country. He knows the danger. Man, what a coup it'd be back at the lodge when they hear about this. I can almost taste the danger, and there's one thing about danger... What? It turns... me... on. Kenneth... you animal. [growling] Sinaga, the way to a man's heart is through his liver. -[chuckles] -All right, now, Buck, now that you've had the night to think about it... Yeah, yeah, yeah. Okay, what's this justice gonna cost me? I got a good deal for you. Only five thousand. You know I don't have that kind of money. I don't believe you've taken into account all of your possessions. I'm sure it would be more than enough to cover the bill. I told you, it's not for sale. At the expense of a work camp? Oh, come on now, Buck, don't be a fool. Good morning, all. Okay, you can open that up now. Mr. Manchester, what are you talking about? I just came to the bursar's office. -This man's lien's been paid. -[Meyer] That's impossible. No one in this village has that kind of money. [laughing] Well, I do. Now, let him out. Mr. Malone, I paid your lien. Now that you're a free man, how'd you like to guide us through the jungle? Mr. Manchester, you can't do this. I mean, this is mostly unusual. I'm the one who arranged your safari. I'm sure I can find you a suitable new guide. Yes, but why bother when I'm looking at the best in the world? Well, Mr. Malone? I didn't ask you to pay my lien. I paid your lien in hopes that you would want to join us. Hope you consider it. Get this straight, buddy. We're talking cannibal country. They kill you, then they eat you. [laughing] You're in constant danger of becoming lunch. Oh, I don't think so. Not with you. He paid your lien, Buck. A gentleman would always repay such kindness. There you go with that gentleman shit again. It might be fun. All right, Mr. Manchester, -I get 250 a day. -All right. Sinaga comes along, and you pay for the rum. For an opportunity like this, anything you want is fine with me. Be ready at dawn. Oh, my God. Kenneth. [romantic music] Come on, pet, let's boogie. [rock music] Oh, here's to my clients, the Hills, Holmby and Beverly. This is the way to the disco, isn't it? [Ken] Uh, just step over him, honey. Hello, Mr. Meyer, Buck, can I buy you a drink? -You already have. -What? A safari guide never buys his own liquor, it's an old custom. Watch it, Kenneth, this guy looks like he'll drink straight through your trust fund. [laughing] She's such a wit. Yoo hoo! Bucky! My things! -She's stolen my things! -This is highly irregular. These kind of people have to be controlled. Miss, you got to be flattered. You look beautiful, baby. I'll be right there. Champagne. -[Buck snores] -God, even in his sleep! Hey, don't look at me like that 'cause I am not gonna leave. [speaking native dialect] Forget it, you had him last night. Ladies, there's no need for anyone to quarrel, there's no need for anyone to fight. There's enough of me to go around tonight. [adventure music] No, there's too much gear here. -One trunk, that's it. -Who do you think you are? You're working for us, remember? [laughing] Look, Missy, unless you want to walk 700 miles in the roughest country this side of Valdosta, Georgia, I suggest you start listening to me right now. You got it? Look, there's only so much room in the plane, honey. You can make do. Can't you? Come on, be a sport. Aha, aha, you see that? [shrieking] I can't wear this with this. "One trunk, Missy." I have to pack a robe, I'll take two. I have to pack something for Kenneth. Oh, Tennessee Buck! Do you mind? Let's move out. [adventurous music] Take it up, Sinaga. [engine starting] What kind of death trap is this? Relax, we're ready to take off. Remember to turn your seat backs and tray tables to their full, upright and locked position. [upbeat electronic music] [music continues] There, you see? Nothing to it. [Ken] Your compass isn't working! Son of a bitch! Don't sweat it, I know the way. You call this your great white hunter? [screaming] He did that on purpose! [Buck] You can smell the jungle vegetation even from this altitude. Here on in no signs of civilization, no roads, no towns, no airports, no nothing. Tell us about Calpai. [Buck] Incredible wild game. Some of the most beautiful jungle streams and waterfalls you've ever seen. And then there's the Gyushi. What's that? Head hunters. He's just trying to scare us. It's Mr. Malone's idea of a joke. Gyushi are no joke, Missy, they're real. Have been since the Stone Age. All they know about the 20th Century are the planes that fly overhead. They do believe in eating human flesh and shrinking human heads. [adventurous music] [upbeat music] [Barbara screaming] [plane swooshing] [screaming] Let go now, we made it. I'm sorry. It's okay, you kept me awake for the final approach. [indistinct chatter] [sighing] Come on, Missy. Think they're friendly? [suspenseful music] [all cheering] [upbeat music] [drumming] [clapping] [drumming continues] [speaking native dialect] [drumming continues] -Buck, Buck. -Yeah? I thought you said these were the good guys. Oh, the skull? It's a monkey skull. Oh, my! Sure, what do you think you're eating? Monkey mousse. [yelling] Ah, ah, ah! [drumming] [clapping] [speaking native dialect] [speaking native dialect] [laughing] Hey, Manchester. Manchester. Chief says that you and me can have her tonight if we want. What do you think, huh? How about it, huh? Oh, no. I couldn't. -You sure? -[Ken] Yeah, but thanks anyway. [man chanting] [all cheering] Oh, baby. [moaning] Oh, baby. -Oh, baby... -Barbara. Right. [gasping] Baby? -Kenneth? -[snoring] [suspenseful music] Careful, Missy. Most things around here like to hunt at night. Does that include the head hunters? Just over the second ridge. You can't see it from here. You mean they're there? [Buck] They're there, all right. Sinaga says you lived with them. Did you...? Eat human flesh? Yeah. They call it long pig. Actually, it's kind of sweet tasting. Sinaga says you can't be killed while you're wearing that amulet. Sinaga talks too much. Your, uh, party broke up early. Just being courteous. Lets the Chief think he's a big man. Isn't that what you do? [chuckles] Is that what you don't like about me? Because I'm a beauty queen who married a rich man? Well, my husband gets his money's worth every night, more than his money's worth. Which is more than you can say, or you wouldn't be sitting out here alone at midnight, holding onto some goddamned good luck medal. You better pay your dues before you start putting other people down. [ominous music] Man, you should've seen me last night! Oh, yeah? Didn't sleep a wink, huh? Oh, no. [sighing] You know, back at the lodge we say that a man's gun is an extension of himself. Now, this... this is my little baby. .600 Nitro Express. It could stop a freight train. Little too much stopping power for me. Oh, come on, how can you have too much power? Well, the kick'd knock your second and third shots high. Could knock the ammo right out of the breech. Ammo... breech. There must be something more exciting to talk about than guns. Yeah, we could talk about that branch you're waving around, makes poison ivy look like crabgrass. [laughing] [upbeat music] [speaking native dialect] [grunting] Damn tricky those hammocks. Hope you shoot better than you sleep. Load up. My pleasure. Why don't we put a little wager on? You know, to keep things interesting. You're drunk! I wouldn't want to take advantage of you. I always find, Mr. Manchester, that a man usually says, "I don't want to take advantage of you" just before he does. Will a thousand do? Let's make it two. Ready when you are. Sinaga, get us a couple of beers. Yes, sir! Okay. Sinaga will throw a can up in the air, you see how many holes you can put in it, all right? Me shooting against Buck Malone. [laughing] Somebody pinch me. -[suspenseful music] -[snarling] [Sinaga yells] [shot] [shot] That was wonderful, Kenneth. Not bad. [suspenseful music] [Barbara screaming] [shot] I guess you lost. Oh, yeah? [several shots] How can anyone shoot like that? -And when they've been drinking. -It takes a lot of practice. Four or five hours a day, seven days a week. You practice shoot that much? No, I drink that much. [upbeat music] [speaking native dialect] [speaking native dialect] Okay, boys, no tiger today. Let's go, let's go. [suspenseful music] Why don't you get a dog? [suspenseful music] Can we go home now? Missy, I'd prefer if you'd stay with the group. I want to go home. Just relax. Don't worry, it's not a poisonous variety. At least, I don't think so. Mr. Buck! Mr. Buck! [speaking native dialect] -What's he saying? -[both speaking native dialect] Oh, he spotted your tiger five miles over the Odia gorge. That's great! -Did you hear that, baby? -Barbara. [both speaking native dialect] They're gonna drive the tiger to us. Come on. [adventurous music] [Ken] Okay, honey, just follow them down -and use the trees for balance. -[Buck] Careful now. -[Ken] Just ease your way down. -[Buck] Toss me your gun. [Ken] Here you go, slide, slide. There you go. Okay, here I come. [Buck] You're all right? [Ken] Right as rain. Sinaga. [sniffs] Bleh! Gyushi. You guys are afraid of a little piece of shit? How can he tell what kind of crap that is anyway? Sinaga can tell you if they ate arms or legs for breakfast. The Gyushi eat people, and it looks like they've expanded their territory. I suggest we get out of here while we still got our heads. [man screaming] [suspenseful music] [Barbara screaming] [sighing] Head hunters? [shouting] [shooting] [men yelling] [shouting continues] [All] Oh! Oh! [speaking native dialect] -[whimpers] Help. -[men imitate Barbara] [ominous music] [speaking native dialect] Hey! Hey! [speaking native dialect] -[Ken grunting] -[yelling] You got to get us out of here. Tell them I'm rich. Yeah, yeah, tell them I'm rich. Tell them I'll get them anything they want. Like what, Ken? A really bitchin' Vet? [bitter laugh] We still have a chance of getting out of here. They believe that to cannibalize an enemy gives one power. You mean they're going to eat them? -Yeah. -[crying] But when it comes to white skin, they got a little spooked, so act brave, it shakes them up. If they think you have any power, any power at all, they might not kill you. [suspenseful music] [whimpering] [speaking native dialect] [speaking native dialect] [grunting] [speaking native dialect] [speaking native dialect] -[upbeat music] -[speaking native dialect] [speaking native dialect] [yelling] [upbeat music] [speaking native dialect] [speaking native dialect] -What are they saying? -Hey! [speaking native dialect] [speaking native dialect] [ominous music] [screaming] [laughing] [speaking native dialect] [speaking native dialect] [screaming] -Where are they taking her? -What? Where are they taking her? [Buck] Calm down, I don't think they're gonna kill her... now. [screaming] [eerie music] [speaking native dialect] [speaking native dialect] Take it easy, Manchester. It's a Rolex. [speaking native dialect] I hope you said something good. I told him you were a powerful man. Now, act that way. [speaking native dialect] My feet! [thud] [speaking native dialect] [speaking native dialect] You mean... you mean I'm free? I can go? -Yeah. -[laughing] -They're gonna hunt you. -What? It's their sport. It's called a bloodhunt. Fortunately for you, I've goaded them into sending Sinaga with you. You listen to him and do exactly like he says, you just might make it. I'll make it and I'll be back. I'll be back and... and I'll get help, a lot of it, I promise. -Take care of him. -Yes, sir. Excuse me. [ominous music] Hey, hey. Stop! Hey, boy, get your ass over here! You see the color of my skin, huh? I'm the boss! But that's not the right way, sir. [both grunting] [laughing] Rambo! [all cheering] [both speaking native dialect] [speaking native dialect] [all cheering] [speaking native dialect] [all cheering] [tense music] Mr. Manchester, not this way! Look out! [screaming] Sinaga, get up. [yelling] What do you want? Come on, you son of a bitch. [Barbara screaming] [ominous music] [speaking native dialect] [gasping] [speaking native dialect] [speaking native dialect] [speaking native dialect] [speaking native dialect] [speaking native dialect] [speaking native dialect] [speaking native dialect] [ominous music] [grunting] [all gasp] I'm too old for this. [grunting] [yelling] It's really unfair. All right, you fuck. [suspenseful music] [thud] [chatter in native dialect] [crowd murmurs] [all gasping] Huh? [speaking native dialect] [suspenseful music] [thud] -[muffled scream] -Sh. [screaming] [ominous music] [suspenseful music] [speaking native dialect] [all cheering] [ominous music] What are you doing? Just leaving a little message. [upbeat music] [yelling] [tense music] [thud] [tense music] [screaming] [screaming] [tense music] [speaking native dialect] [speaking native dialect] [speaking native dialect] Why did you let him go? If they're afraid of us, it might just split' them up. Besides, now I know they're tracking us like a tiger. Two flanking units and one up the middle. They know we're headed for the lagoon. Is there a quick way to get there? Yeah, by moving our ass. [suspenseful music] [speaking native dialect] [speaking native dialect] [speaking native dialect] [speaking native dialect] [all speaking native dialect] [speaking native dialect] [all cheering] [suspenseful music] -Ouch! -What happened? I spend my life in heels, I turn my ankle walking barefoot. Come on. Which one is it? This one. Right there? Do you think they're still out there? Oh, yeah, the Chief won't give up until I'm dead... or he is. This thing you wear really isn't you. There must be some kind of story behind this. Several years ago, when I was still guiding the hunts, I was flying over this island. I got developed engine problems and I had to crash land. My wife and son were killed. Anyway, I wandered in the jungle for... must have been days. The head hunters found me, the Gyushi. They've been tracking me since the crash. They thought I was some kind of god. Come on, you're gonna have to put your weight on this. We got to push on, come on. Just lean on me, okay? Take it easy. I lived with these people for about three years, hunted with them, fished with them, helped them kill their enemies. One day, we were attacked by the Warami tribe, and I saved the life of the old Chief's wife and young son, whom you now know very well. You mean you saved that bastard's life? [Buck] Yeah, anyway, the old Chief gave me this amulet out of gratitude. Sealed it on me in a fire ceremony. Said as long as I have it on, nothing could harm me. The young Chief really wants this amulet, but he can't take it from me as long as I'm alive. Either I have to give it to him, or he has to take it off my dead body. The river's near, I can smell it. [Barbara] Good. [screaming] Something's biting me! -Fire ants! -Get them off! Come on. [screaming] Calm down, calm down, calm down! The adrenalin just makes it worse. Come on, relax. Relax. You gotta relax, stop shaking, just relax. Better? Feels like lit cigarettes all over you, huh? Yeah. Just relax. [upbeat music] [men yelling] [screaming] We have to get that out right now. Just do it! Ouch. That wasn't in very deep. It didn't have to be. What do you mean? The tip was poisoned. Curare. I'm gonna have to... [ominous music] [gasping] [upbeat music] Holy shit. Oh, my God. Oh, God, no! [screaming] -Are you all right? -Yeah. Are you okay? Yeah. That's my snuff. My last one. It'll dry out. We're not too far from the mouth of the river. We can walk from there. Can you make it? Yeah. [upbeat music] [men yelling] [men yelling] [yelling] [all speaking native dialect] [engine splutters] Shit! Okay, try it. [engine splutters] -[thud] -Try it again! [engine splutters] -Again! -Come on, come on! [thud] Come on, come on! [engine roaring] [natives yelling] Buck. Oh, my God. I don't know how to drive the plane. [upbeat music] [speaking native dialect] The son of a bitch is hanging onto the plane. [speaking native dialect] Don't you hate it when people you don't like always want to tag along? [Chief screaming] [screaming] All right. It's just like you to show up after the action is over. About Mr. Manchester... Forget it, I know you tried your best. [speaking native dialect] You're turning back! That's right. [speaking native dialect] [speaking native dialect] You keep it. I've enjoyed about all the good luck I can stand. [upbeat music] Well, let's get the hell out of here. [adventure music]
