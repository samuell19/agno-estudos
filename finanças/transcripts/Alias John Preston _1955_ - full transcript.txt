Subtitles by Nostromo Hey, Charlie,what about those glasses? Come on everybody help yourself. That's it. Sally Excuse me everybody Excuse me. - Hello,Phyllis. - Hi,Sally. Cheers It's cider! Yes, I know. It ought to be champagne but I can't afford it as an "amateur" golf champion not on the salary of Dukins - That was a great match, Bob. - Thank you Phyllis. That last shot on the run My heart was in my mouth watching you! Bob is never nervous when he plays golf Well,he's nervous enough now You could show a little more enthusiasm Thrilled by you won the cup, I couldn't be more pleased Well, you don't act as you were Would you want me to do a cartwheel or make a speech? I'll take the cartwheel Sally You know,you'd better get changed for the dance. Oh yeah! I suppose so. Excuse me everybody. Goodbye. - Goodbye. - Cheerio. You treat him badly,you know. Well, he seems to like it. He keeps asking for more Bob is a darling. You want to recognize a good thing when you see it You're lucky. Am I? Maybe I don't want that kind of luck. Skimmed my last one? I did. But I don't think you should rhyme lips with eclipse Madam, you have no soul for poetry. Of course I have. Good. I taught the boy all he knew. Margot,he has left me far behind. I couldn't never play the game she plays. Don't you think Sally looks awfully pretty tonight? Pink always suited her particularly. How about giving me something for the paper, Dick? I'm still short of half a column of local news News? Even if I had any I wouldn't dream of giving it to you, Joe. Not since you printed that piece about the loan we refused to. A duty of an editor is to his public. In the law of libel,of course,and you didn't give it to me.I dug it up and sung - Yes, could have asked me first - No arguments you two - More coffee, dear? - Thank you my dear. Lovely new hairstyle makes you twice as pretty. Does it? Maybe I wasn't so pretty before. - That's not exactly what I meant. - What did you mean? What about tomorrow night, Sal? There's a new picture on local.. I don't know. Mother wants me to go with her to a meeting. - Excuse me. - Yes,sure You have a mania for privacy,Dick. You know,bankers bound by the rules of his profession. If we gossip about our clients business how could they trust us? All right. Tell us how is business in general? - But you won't quote me ... - Oh,I thought so You thought what ? Nothing ever happens in Deanbridge. Nothing at all. The rest of the world is full of terrible and exciting events We are barely alive. My son wins the golf championship Your daughter has a new dress. Mrs. Sandford bakes a new cake ... What's wrong with that? I bake very nice cakes. Nothing. Nothing at all. Except when a barn catches fire, Perhaps somebody gets drunk, it's a front-page sensation Isn't that as it should be? At least all our troubles are small. That should make us all feel happy. Doesn't make me happy. I've got a paper to get out Bob,this is the third time you've cut in after one minute they'll start talk of you About the two of us? I hope so. - Oh, you are horrible! - Tomorrow night? You can always try. Is it true that the Elliot's are closing the factory? - Why don't you ask them? - I did,they wouldn't talk I've heard that half the orders are fallen off and the men are standing idle You are a very transparent man,Joe And even though we've been friends for thirty years ... Forty. Don't forget we were eight years at school together Joe, we need new blood in this town. New capital. New enterprise. But where does it come from? It's only the big cities that attract it. Who would come to Deanbridge as an investor? Why not. We've got certain advantages. We are on the main line. Lovely countryside.Why shouldn't people come and settle down here? Don't quote the pamphlets you wrote for the Chamber of Commerce,Joe Plenty of towns have the same assets - Hello, Mr. Newton. - Hello my dear. Enjoying yourself? - Good evening,Mrs Sandford -Thank you Congratulations, young man. I only hope golf won't go to your head. You ought to leave room for other things customer accounts for instance Would you like to dance my dear? Good morning. Can I see the manager,please? I'll see if Mr. Sandford is free,Sir What name shall I say? - Preston, John Preston. - Just a moment,Sir Mr. Sandford will see you now,Sir - This way please. - Thank you very much. Mr. Preston,Sir - Hello, Mr. Preston. - Mr. Sandford. Do sit down. Well,all this appears to be most satisfactory. Now you want a deposit and a drawing account. Maybe you suggest, Mr. Sandford. Of course,in the countries where I spent the years since the war I've been most of my transactions in cash. Perhaps it isn't customary here I am afraid I wouldn't know where to find that No, of course not. You plan to settle in Deanbridge,then? Yes. If I like it sufficiently I hope you will I was telling a friend of mine only a short time ago that we need some new blood in our town. - It's a very attractive town. - Do you think so? Forgive me the personal question, but ... How did you come to think of Deanbridge, Mr. Preston? I am a man of very sudden impulses, Mr Sandford. With me the first thoughts are the best and the decisive ones. Whatever success I may have had in life I owe to that Oh yes? During the war in Africa,I had a friend who came from Deanbridge. At least he always talking about forest, fishing, home brewed cider, kindness and simplicity of the people ... When he died, I was with him. And then later when I got a little tired of roaming about the name of Deanbridge came into my mind. So half-and fun,I thought I'd come down here and have a look at it That's very interesting, Mr. Preston. You see,in the years that I've been spent away since the war I've seen a little bit too much of noise and excitement. The reason I come back here was in peace and quiet I am not all together the idle type, so I guess something will turn up will keep me occupied I'm sure it will In the meantime, if I can be of any help,just let me know I certainly will,thank you very much - Goodbye, Mr. Preston. - Goodbye. Bob, see that this risk draft is cleared and these securities deposited And Bob, a bank employee is not suppose to express any opinion about the size or state of a client's account unless authorized by the bank in the course of his duties Yes, Mr. Sandford. It was not an opinion. It was pure envy. Quite It's all very well to say that you are not interested, But there, you shut in your father's study for almost two hours . At least you know what your father is. I have to get it out of him with a chisel It must be some sort of a business discussion I know that. But what business can be so urgent that this Mr. Preston turns up at the house right after dinner? Couldn't it been settled at the bank? Your poor father needs a rest like anybody else. Dad doesn't mind. Isn't Bobby coming in tonight? Don't call him Bobby. And it he isn't Don't snap off my head,dear. I only asked a civil question. Why shouldn't I call Mr Newton Bobby? Because it makes him sound like. Well, what it is, immature and a little ridiculous. Sally, I don't know what's got into you. You seemed to like him well enough only a week ago. That was a week ago. And at your age, that's practically a lifetime Well, I suppose you'll make it up a usual I'll be at the bank tomorrow at ten, but I rather wanted to get this bid at first thing in the morning. I do hope you forgive the intrusion Don't mention it.This is important and I am glad to be of help. I hope I haven't spoiled your evening, Miss Sandford. Or yours, Mrs Sandford. I do realize how much you must value these peaceful family occasions. Having no home of my own, I'd rather forget how pleasant they could be. Don't you worry about us, Mr. Preston. Dick often brings his work home. We're used to being alone. I still feel a little guilty. Perhaps I can make amends I have got two seats for the Music Festival that starts next Saturday Perhaps you'd like to come to the first concert with me and then dinner afterwards. Well,I'm not a great lover of music myself, I'm ashamed to say that Sally... Sally is quite a pianist She goes regularly. What about it, Miss Sanford? Didn't you mention going to the Music Festival, Sally? Well, I wanted to, but ... Wouldn't you let me take you then? Thank you, Mr. Preston. Most kind of you Fine.Fine.Well,I'll call for you with a car around five on Saturday - Good night. - Good night. Good night,Mr. Preston. Well,isn't that nice of Mr. Preston!It will do you good to have a day out Needn't to have been so obvious. Obvious? But I'd thought it would please you I'm sorry, Mother. I'm in a awful temper today. Of course I am pleased. I think I'd better take my nasty temper to bed That's that I want to move in on Monday. You drew a hard bargain,Preston. That's a strange remark for a banker to make. I mean you're not supposed to have first mortgages where ordinary people wear their hearts. Well, you see the Elliot's family has been in Deanbridge for 200 years. That factory of theirs was started over a century ago. Yes, and seemed to run along the same lines in 1800 and something I'm sorry,I've got no sympathy for such people They are like,they are like people who are crawling the roads just as dangerous as the speeders. Progress is necessary,I agree Still the Elliot's could have got a much better price if they'd waited. I knew they couldn't afford to wait. So whatever price they'd might have got is quite immaterial However,please don't think I'm not very grateful for all the help you've given me You certainly wasted no time, Preston. In less than two months in Deanbridge bought an office building, a factory, a farm, doubled one investment made a good profit on another. I told you once when you made the first thoughts were the best,didn't I? This is only the beginning. You and I are going to make Deanbridge a high hub industry again Bowler,I have the check. You can complete the transfer of papers now Yes. He wants to move in Monday. Not losing any time And he wants dismissal notices sent to every employee He intends to rehire some of them but entirely at his own discretion. All right Is it true,Dick? That Preston bought the Elliot factory. That he is going to manufacture some new synthetic material That he is dismissing all the old employees. Wait a minute.Are you asking questions or telling me? This is news! News at last! - Something real I can write about - There has been a sale. The rest you must find out from the principals,not from me Oh! You bankers are like clams BTW Don't you think we ought to put Preston up for the Town Council for next election? And how about inviting him to sit on the hospital board? We'd have to show our gratitude somehow Let's wait and see, Joe. Curb your enthusiasm. After all,Preston is a newcomer. Let's reserve judgment until he fully proves himself Has he not done that to your satisfaction? Well,his financial standing is sound His plans,though unusual show considerable vision But I like to reserve my judgment a little longer. Spoken like a founder member of the Society of Bankers Oh very well! I've got to put my paper to bed Very exciting this week. Somebody stolen a couple of ducks. Good evening, Mrs. Sandford. Oh Bob!How nice of you to drop in Where's Sally? Didn't you know? She's gone to the Festival concert with Mr. Preston. But she promised I'm sure she knew she had a previous engagement with you She wouldn't have been forgotten. It wasn't exactly that. I told her I might get a couple of tickets to that amateur show over in Wallingham I only got them at the last moment Well, these things sometimes happen . You know how fan of music Sally is Yes I guess so well Well, I'd better be going. Good night, Bob. And don't take it to heart. Really don't There are lots of pretty girls in Deanbridge Look, why don't you phone Dorothy Gregg? I know she'd be glad to ... Yes. Well, good night, Mrs. Sandford. Did I say something? You,suddenly looked rather surprised. No. Well, you speak French like a native. I can assure you any native would know I wasn't any Frenchman in five seconds but sometimes it does help Did you enjoy the concert? I loved every minute of it Excuse me,Sir,but there has been a mistake. Mistake? Yes,your table it has been reserved.You shouldn't have been seated here at all So if you would care to move to the upper. - I care to to do nothing of the sort. - But, sir ... There was no reserve sign on this table when we came in That is most regrettable. What is also most regrettable is your lack of efficiency and bad manners I don't care for people who reserve this table eat in the kitchen Really,Sir. You heard me! I want no argument. This is our table and I intend to keep it Yes sir. You must forgive this show of temper I just cannot bear being bullied by people of that type. It's all right I just wondered. Yes? Well,do you feel this strongly about everything? Everything worthwhile, yes. - Like the restaurant table? - It's a matter of principle. Insolence and bad manners can ruin life. Anyway let's not talk about that any more. Tell me about yourself. There isn't much to tell Truly feminine answer Really there is nothing very interesting about me. I have lived in Deanbridge all my life. Except for one carefully conducted European tour where I and 10 of the girls were escorted from one museum to the next church and from one castle to the next ancient monument. Oh, but I did like France! Well,there you differ from me. I hate it. Really? I thought that everyone loved Paris . Maybe it's because I didn't see it as a tourist at least not as a willing one Were you in the war right from the beginning? I was in it far too long. Just that's I don't want to be reminded of it,if you don't mind But you must have seen a so much of the world. So much beauty, and so many interesting and colorful things You don't notice the beauty when you are sweating and fighting And it isn't even colorful or interesting except perhaps in one's memories And I hate reminiscing Why? I once told your father that for me the first thoughts were always the best. I never look back. What if there are obstacles in the way? - You'd break them down - If you can't? - There is always a way. - You are very confident Sally, I guess there is really two kinds of life. Yours,sheltered, perhaps even a little dull but sunny and straight And there's the other kind.The kind you find in the jungle.All its crooked paths With dangers littered behind every bush. Where you have to fight every stuck of your way That's the kind I've known. And I don't want to remember it But now I believe I may have found the first Sir,you,see it is a personal matter. Yes, I thought so I didn't think you'd be getting so excited about anything to do with the bank Why don't you come around to the house this evening? I can't do that. That the last ... - It is about Sally. - Sally? These last six months,she's changed I mean as far as we are concerned I've known her before she met ... What I mean is ... well,we had grown up together and I decided to marry her or no one else Ever since we started in school together You decided what about her? Well,she never said she wouldn't Bob, you know I like you. Your father and I have been friends for most of our lives I consider you a very desirable son-in-law. Thank you, Mr. Sanford,thank you But I'm not Sally. And though you may consider me an old fogy I am not so old fashioned just to dictate the choice of my daughter's husband. - But if you are on my side. - I didn't say that. I said I was not against you But it's up to Sally. Now,why don't you talk to her? I would, if I could. I've hardly seen her these last few months When she isn't playing the piano,she driving with that Preston. How she can waste time an old guy like...? Preston is 36 No doubt his age of someone of 25 like yourself he's also a close friend of our family In the seven or eight months since he settled here he's done a good deal for all of us So don't be to critical of him. And now,you'd better go back to your job Oh,and Bob ... I wouldn't give up all hope,you know Hello John. Everything settled? Yes. We got the contract. That's keep busy for about 18 months Excellent! And I owe you an apology Why? Because you were overcautious? It's part of your professional equipment, Dick.I like you all the more for it.. Don't like myself.If I had not been so,well, doubtful I would have taken a larger share of the financing Well, there will be other opportunities. I'm sure. I'm a little tired, Dick. Fools always make me tired. Fools? Well, call them a little too conservative. I convinced them in the first five minutes that I could turn out cheaper goods,better and more quickly than anybody else But it would have been beneath their dignity to seen it then and there. It doesn't matter now. It is all signed and sealed. BTW Don't forget the hospital board meeting tomorrow What? Don't tell me you've forgotten about your election last moth Oh no no! Of course not. Dick, I think I've waited long enough. Waited for what? To ask you if you have any objections if I ask Sally to marry me. Is that an absurd idea? Forgive me, John.Of course it isn't. There is nothing funny about marriage. - At least I don't think so. - Well why are you laughing? Because only five minutes ago, someone else asked the same question. Who? Young Bob.You know,Joe Newton's son. He's working here, in case you haven't noticed That boy ... That boy has loved Sally since they were both knee high. Dick,please don't think I'm doubting Newton's sincerity. You really meant it about yourself and Sally? How long have you known me,Dick? Eight? Nine months? You ought to know by now that I rarely say anything I don't mean But it's so sudden ... Or is that what young girls are supposed to say and not their fathers? Dick,I love Sally deeply and sincerely. That's why I wanted to talk to you before I told her. So you haven't told her yet? I know how you feel about Sally,Dick. I appreciate that.Well, I have no objection at all, if you talk to her. I admire you, John. Your energy, your vision, your industry ... - And if Sally accepts you ... - Oh,she'll will It was a lucky day for me when I came to Deanbridge,Dick A very lucky day. Sally tells me you play bridge,Mr. Preston. Would you like a game now? You know John,I coming to the conclusion that my wife thinks the most important thing in life is a bridge game. BTW dear, you promised to go through those bills with me before I send out the cheques. Dick,we went through them in the afternoon. You know what your handwriting is like. I can't make head or tail at that second page. Couldn't it wait until tomorrow? I don't want to be... Come to think of it, I'm not not so sure I signed the items myself Would you excuse us for a few moments, Mr. Preston? Yes, of course. Sally, I hope you noticed. Noticed what, John? Your fathers exquisite tact Dad's always tactful especially with mother Yes, but he knew I wanted to talk to you alone. Oh Sally,when I came to Deanbridge 9 months ago I had nothing except money and memories -Memories that you wanted to forget -I got rid of them,all right,let me explain The money helped me to acquire a factory,a farm a place in the community with good friends and helpful acquaintances There was only one thing I need A wife. And you've picked me for the part? I know I ought to have done it in a proper romantic manner,right? I should have taken you out in the car, provided you with soft music and champagne and then under the moonlight, said: Sally, my darling I love you. Will you marry me? You think I'm awfully silly Isn't that you like to hear ? I don't know about all girls. I only know about myself. And what is it you know? I love you,Sally.I love you because you are sweet and beautiful. I love you because you have everything in the world a man could want Because you have everything that I want. - Sally ... - Now you're really being romantic. I knew it the first time you and I went out together. - Bob, what are you doing here? - I've been waiting. - For me? - For your visitor to leave. Bob,I'm sorry. It's an easy word. You step on somebody's toes ... Sorry. You wreck a fellow's life.Sorry You're so bitter,how can I talk to you? Sally, I knew that it was real between you and me You liked to pretend,the usual girl's game. And I didn't mind. But not this. Bob, we're going to be married,John and I You can't! You can't! You can't prevent it. Sally,he's not for you. There is something strange about him. Something that I can't put my finger on You may think you love him Maybe even impressed you - But I know that ... - Bob,what do you know? I'm not much younger than you are. And I am a woman. What's that got to do with it? We could argue all night and all next year and I still couldn't make you understand. I love him,Bob. Now please go home and don't be angry with me. Anger won't help I'm not angry with you.I've anger with him That is even less reasonable. Reasonable? Is there anything reasonable about? If I only can make you believe that it isn't myself. Not my own life I'm thinking about but yours. I'm afraid for you ... Well you needn't be because I'm safe Safer and happier than I've ever been First of all,gentlemen it is my pleasant duty to welcome a new member to our board Mr. John Preston. Though a comparative stranger to our community He has been a most generous benefactor to our hospital and has recently undertaken to guarantee a substantial part of the cost of the building of a new wing. I'm sure that he will prove a most valuable asset to administration of our hospital Mr. John Preston. Dr Underwood, gentlemen. Not very much that I could say except that I am very conscious of this honor and I do realize that I must offer more than just material assistance to the work. However,there is just one thing I would like to add I believe that suffering is unnecessary. I believe that pain exists in the world today because people are too stupid or too lazy to do away with it. And that is why I believe that the work that we do between these walls is so important and so wonderful.Thank you The first point on our agenda is the appointment of a part time Consulting Psychiatrist A psychiatrist? But ours is a general hospital. The need has been felt for some time to have an additional ward for nervous and mental diseases Don't tell us,Dr,that lunacy is on the increase in Deanbridge I have no reliable statistics,Sir,as to that But our hospital covers a wide area,besides the town proper And it has happened in the past that mental patients That had to put in the same ward as surgical and other cases That can't be very satisfactory I'd call that an understatement, Mr Sandford. Now a very favorable opportunity has arisen I understand that Dr. Walton is back in this country. Peter Walton? But he's a Deanbridge boy I believe so. His qualifications is of course of the highest order And he a not only a psychiatrist, but also a psychoanalyst. -A psychoanalyst? -Yes,Mr Preston. Of course I'm not really qualified I'm only a layman but Well I don't altogether approve of this Freudian mumbo-jumbo Gentlemen, I can assure you that Dr. Walton not only has international reputation but his books are standard works according to the experts. And he's Deanbridge boy. His father had the best cider mill in the county. That of course makes the whole thing quite decisive Gentlemen,I'm afraid we cannot waste much time on this discussion. We have many points to cover But I'm quite sure the members can have no real objections to Dr Walton? Shall we take a vote? Perhaps a show of hands Will those in favor,kindly indicate in that manner Good,then it's agreed, with one abstention to the appointment of Dr. Walton as consulting psychiatrist. And now,Mr. Sandford, perhaps you read your report on the fundraising campaign for the hospital. I'd like a word with you, Mr Preston. It's you, Newton. What is it? - You know quite well what it is. - Do I? Sally thinks she loves you, but you don't love her. You don't love anyone except maybe yourself - Look, why don't you just go? - Shut up! I'll do the talking. Right ahead You are going to give her up. She isn't right for you. She'd never be happy. Suppose you let Sally and me be the best judge of that. No why don't you go on home ? And put that thing away! It's different now Preston,isn't it? You can't act so superior Do you think a gun makes all that difference? It even things up. You got power and money. You got Sally. I just have a gun. But we are equals now Don't be such a fool! All I have to do is to pull the trigger ... we won't be equals any more You will be dead and I ... - Where will you be? - I don't care. You are even a bigger fool than I thought. You have smooth talk, Preston. Do you think you can talk your way out of this? No,I don't think so, but I know you'll going to change your mind. Why should I? Why shouldn't I kill you? I hate you enough. Because you are not the killing type. Do you think I haven't seen real killers before? It's only in books a murderer bloats over his victim If you don't shut up, I'll ... You see I knew you couldn't do it I just wanted to give you a chance to find out for yourself And why don't you,go on home and forget about the whole thing? - It looks just about right to me - You think it is dry enough? I think in the end you'll notice Dr Walton,I suppose you will remember the editor of our local press - Joe Newton. - I certainly do Nice to see you again, Joe. You must excuse me for a few minutes? It's quite an honor for our little community. A famous man settling here. And a native son with that A prodigal son,Joe. We are delighted to have our own prominent psychoanalyst. I am sure you'll have a great success. You see everybody in this town loves to talk but nobody wants to listen. So now? You have a man whose profession is to listen Do you think they can afford the luxury? It depends on right publicity,Peter. Now look if you were to write a special outlook for the Deanbridge Mail on mental hygiene - Hello dear. - Hello,doctor. Mother, Mrs. Bringly is dying to ask you some questions about the wedding. And you can answer them much better than I. - Excuse me. - See you later about that article. - A cigarette? - No,thank you.I don't smoke. John doesn't approve of women smoking. - John? - John Preston, my fiancé. And like a dutiful bride to be you follow his commands When they are sensible. John's ideas usually make sense I got the strange feeling to hear that you are being married in a few weeks Last time I saw you,you were a little girl desperately unhappy because your puppy had to be destroyed I never dreamt you'd remember that. I remember how you hated me because I was the one who had to put him out of his misery I guess I wasn't very sensible then. But now you are,thanks to John. Oh,he's quite wonderful,Peter! You know he only came to Deanbridge a short while ago and already is one of our leading citizens. Adroit to the Bank , owner one of the largest factory and leader in all the charity affairs A pillar of the community no less. Now you're making fun.There he is. Excuse me please. - Hello. - How are you,Tom. -Thank you,John -I'm glad you could get here too. Darling I thought you would never get here I'm sorry I couldn't get away from the office any earlier,darling but I had a couple of buyers there it went on and on Dr. Walton,I presume I'm John Preston and among other things your landlord. Oh,I didn't realize Yes,my company owns the building, which you rent your office As a matter of fact, I had to decide whether you were a suitable tenant. I am glad the decision was favorable But John's decision was really against his better judgment He doesn't believe in psychoanalysts. I didn't exactly say that, Sally. Just said I didn't think any human being have the right to invade the mind of another to pry into the privacy of his thoughts as dreams It means a man's mind is his castle Yes, exactly. All you seem to be able to do is to tell an unhappy man why he's unhappy. And I don't call that really being very helpful Sometimes when he knows, he is no longer unhappy However,I would be the last man to start an argument with my landlord He might raise the rent. Thank your father for me,Bob. But tell him that I don't feel quite up in writing an article about Should grandmothers marry - I don't think he really expected you to. - What's wrong? Doctor,you know about strengthening people out? I mean when they are all confused I can sometimes help them do it themselves. - I need help. - What is it? But this has nothing to do with dreams, or complexes ... That is something I can decide later. Can hate be an illness, Dr. Walton? Can it make you sick as if you had a fever? All hate is a sickness, Bob. Sometimes it's a fever too. I often feel as I was choking with it I want to get away anywhere But my mother is invalid. It would kill her if I went away So I have to stay here in Deanbridge where I can see him every day. Him? I'd rather not mention his name. It's a man who took something from me something that mattered more than life. I know. You know? How can anybody know? How can anybody guess what I had to go through? What I'm going through now But you are going through it,Bob, you haven't run away yet I wanted to kill him.I didn't even have the courage to do that. And he laughed at me. He's laughing at me inside every time he sees me. Listen,Bob,I can tell you that time helps that you will forget about all this I could give you a nice easy words about resignation,manliness Well,I won't All I can say is,come and see me whenever you feel like it It will probably help you to have someone to talk to who understands your problem. Thank you Remember I'll be here. If I'm busy,just wait. I'll be glad to see you any time Thank you Doctor. Is this a professional or a private call ? I don't exactly know yet Take your time about making up your mind. I've finished with the last patient for the day. Doing all right? I've only been here about ten days. Can't complain. The rent is safe, Mr. Preston. Please don't laugh at me,doctor. I've been meaning to come and see you for about a week now Well,I've waited because I had to be sure Sure of what? As I said you once before,I don't altogether believe in all this mumbo-jumbo I hate things I don't understand But now,within about a month of my wedding when I got to get my head clear and mind rid of Rid of what? You've got to help me,doctor. You know all about dreams,don't you? Well,I've been having very bad dreams lately We all dream, Mr. Preston. Ninety percent of the time we spend asleep is filled with dreams Most of us don't remember them very clearly, but ... many people mistakenly think that they never dream. I am sure I never did until about a week ago. Why don't you make yourself comfortable and we'll talk about it? Tell me, doctor, can dreams be coherent? Can they mix reality and fantasy in a kind of poisoned Hodge-podge ? Can they go on on like a serial? Three questions all at once. The answer to all three of them is yes. What kind of dreams? Nightmares. Dreadful sickening dreams that ... I can't help remembering. It's got so bad I can't even go to sleep You won't talk to anybody about this. will you doctor? I can be sure of that? I know you consider me a little bit of a witch doctor,Mr. Preston. But I can assure you I'm bound by the same medical ethics as any physician You are as safe talking to me as you would be talking to yourself. I want to be lot safer than that I'm tired talking to myself. You see,in these dreams, I am somebody else I am conscious of assuming the identity of John Preston. Somebody else? Yes. A criminal. His name,somehow I know, is David Garrity. He deserted in France during the war. Became involved in the black market deals made a lot of money. And when the things got to hot,he run away But how do you know all this in your dream? How is the second identity established ? Because there is someone else. A woman. She is more than a friend. Her name is Sylvia. You say you know all this, I mean,in your dream? But what happens? What do you do? It's night. I'm alone in the house that I bought for Sally and myself She doesn't know about it yet, it is a surprise,it's a wedding present. The wind's hollering around the house, battering at the windows. In this first dream, which I dreamt over and over again,it is midnight. I'm spending the night at the house to supervise the workmen who are coming early in the morning I'm getting ready for bed when . Who is it? Sylvia Is that the only welcome I'm going to get, David? Or should I call you Mr John Preston? Why did you come here? You think you can burn everything like that paper. Oh no, David!That would be too easy. What do you want? I wait too long for you to send for me. So,here I am. Look,if you think that you can blackmail me Blackmail ? Oh,David,I wouldn't do that. I wouldn't come just to claim my share. Not only of your money,but of your life. And now that I've found you we must be together,always. She reached up suddenly and kissed me with the old familiar passion And then I knew I had to kill her. Who are you? What do you want in here? Don't be afraid,Preston. I'd better call you that, even though we're alone. I did not come to harm you. This is my house. You've got no right come in here And I understand why. You see I know that you have killed her. That she is in the other room, silent and dead. You know I have followed her.I'd been following her for months And I was outside,watching. I could have stopped you. But that would be last thing I wanted to do. So I stood by the window and watched you kill her. But who are you? What do you want? My name doesn't matter. I was Sylvia's husband. That's a lie! She never had a husband. Oh,yes. I married her when she was seventeen. I was married to her all the time that she was with you And all the others before you. I hated her. And I left her. I suppose sooner or later I would have killed her myself That was the only way to get rid of the poison she became within me So you see you've done me a good turn and I'm grateful. It's no use hating me. It won't help you We are linked together,you and I Forever. And you must believe this, or you will be very unhappy. I know that you will want to kill me because I know what you've done. Don't try it. We are like soldiers fighting on the same front or men digging their way out of prison together. Stop! I've enough of this madness. Now get out! Don't be a fool. You have nothing to fear from me. So long as you behave Now come on We carried her outside and dug a grave near the house He put the body inside and shoveled earth over it covering her blond hair, her face and her body. Then we leveled the ground and put a few stones over the shallow grave. It didn't take long When it was all over,he run away The wind was howling and raging again and I was alone. That was all? Yes, that was all. What have I done to deserve such nightmares? Why did it have to happen to me? - Mr.Preston, was that all the dream? - Yes it was. I've had the same dream Always the same dream. Several times. But that was all Come along and see me tomorrow. It is important. Same time.I'll be here. John,you forgot our meeting. Oh,did I? - Isn't it half past eleven? - No.It was at ten o'clock We waited for half an hour.I phoned you,but you weren't in the office. I'm very sorry,Dick.Something very urgent came up at the factory. The factory? Well, I phoned there too. You ought to check with your secretary. She said you hadn't been there. Well, I wasn't in the office. I was in the designers room. I see. Anyhow,everything is fine. We have gotten the allocations of dials we wanted They are pleased with our export figures Good. John,I've been thinking why don't you combine business and pleasure and take Sally to Paris instead of Rome? To Paris? You speak the language and Benny can't come over now. You could discuss that new summer order with him personally Half hour's talk would do more good than fifty letters. - No. Dick. No. - But why not? I told Sally once I will not go to France. Well,she mentioned something but a few days I'm sorry,Dick. Maybe later Of course,if that's the way you feel about it Operator,would you try to get Mr Preston's new house, please? - I'm sorry,Sir,there's no reply - Thank you. Hello Preston. - Hello Doctor. - Didn't you get my message? No. What message? I telephoned you twice ,the factory and at the house. I've been very busy, you know. Was it important? I think it was.For you. For me? You're thinking about that talk of ours. You can forget that I'm perfectly well now - Are you sure? - Of course I am sure. You modern witch doctors you are all alike. They see neurotics in everybody. I sleep like a log. No dreams I'm very glad to hear it. You will be coming to the wedding, of course? - Yes of course. - Will you have a drink? No, thank you Mrs. Dorrin,don't you think it is too Please mother! It is the latest fashion. And it sits beautifully.I never saw a more radiant bride. I bet you say that to all the girls Now just slip it off,dear. And I'll finish the hem. I'll answer it Yes? Hello,John.Here she is John? Oh darling,if you could see it! But you aren't supposed not until the day My wedding dress,silly! When? Tonight? Yes,it is the first festival concert of the year. and it's kind of anniversary for us two,isn't it darling? Oh I'd love to! What sweet of you to remember. All right, I'll be waiting for you. Goodbye. Haven't you heard? John went away for a few days. But I'm expecting him back today. Was it something urgent? Yes Well,Peter,you're a great success. More patients than you can handle Success,Sally? Mine is a heartbreaking profession The only measure of my success is whether I can help people and sometimes I feel Tell me,when are you getting married? On the seventh.Just three weeks. Time has gone so fast that I can hardly believe that ... Are you quite sure, Sally? Quite sure that John is That you want to marry him? Oh,really Peter, you sound terribly serious! Of course I'm sure. That's John now Back exactly when he promised John darling what a lucky coincidence! Peter Walton is here. He wants to talk to you. Does he? I'll be glad to talk to him - Make some coffees,darling. - Yes of course. Excuse me Peter Hello Doctor.Taken time out for listening Hello,Mr. Preston. I had hoped you'd come to see me. I've been waiting for the past three days Waiting for me? I have been very busy. A man who is about getting married has to put his house in order,you know So I'll see you sometimes next week. Always glad to talk to you,anytime I don't think it should wait that long. Do you have to go out after your patients, Walton? Rob them in like steers? I don't usually do that Goodbye, Mr. Preston. Would you apologies to Sally,for me I've patients coming at five. Yes, of course. Are you a mind reader too? How did you know I was coming tonight? I didn't even expect it myself. But you weren't No. I was all right, while I was away, but the other night a few hours after I saw you at Sally's Another dream? Yes This one was longer, and more complex. Time was strangely telescoped I don't even know if I can remember it all. I'm tired.I'm terribly tired. I had shooting pains I was back in the garden alone. And suddenly I knew that I could not bring Sally back there into that house While she was lying out there in that shallow grave under those stones. I had to get rid of the place and somehow in my dreams I did. Of course the agents were a bit surprised,but I made some plausible excuse ... somehow they got it off my hands. Somebody I've never heard of bought it I was very relieved. Until... Don't do it, Preston! But I have sold the house. I can't risk. - I know. I've bought it. - You've bought it? Yes. I want to be near her Now that she cannot hurt me any longer You don't have to worry,remember you and I are friends now And allies. Isn't there anything you can do,doctor? Isn't there something you can give me? Some drug,anything? I could give him something to keep you awake How long would that work? Sooner or later,you must sleep. Or there is something to make my sleep dreamless? Well, isn't there anything at all you can do? Can you do nothing at all except listen? Is that all you're learning? Have you ever thought of postponing your marriage,Mr. Preston? Of course not! Why should I? It's probably nervous strain of the work Some perfectly natural and normal explanation Well, Dr. Walton, thank you ... For nothing Another dream? Yes You know, doctor, this is getting to be quite absurd. Last night,you were in my dream. Was I? Is it that all you can say? Do you dream peddlers never commit yourselves? Mr. Preston, you don't want a lecture on psychoanalysis. It happens in most cases however Sooner or later the analyst must appear in the patient's dream You spend a lot of time with us our conversation sticks in your mind Your unconscious associate us with your desires or thoughts. Many women fall in love with their analyst. It is a passing phase. Others go to hate them. Or identify them with their fathers or husbands. So don't blame me for appearing in your dreams. But I do blame you. You gave me a quite a scare. At least in my dream,you did In my dream, it was evening. I was walking happy and at peace And suddenly I stopped. There you sat with a stranger. You were talking. I know you were talking about me. And you looked up straight into my eyes I thought I had to get away that something terrible would happen if I stayed Thank you Defying John. I thought he disapproved of you smoking You shouldn't have such a good memory. And John isn't such a tyrant. Sorry. I seem to keep on saying the wrong thing,don't I? Now To what do I owe the pleasure of this visit Peter, please!Really I'm grown up now. I'm not the child you used to know I've realized that.You have grown up. You have grown worries and then inhibitions. What is it do you want to know,Sally? Well, you and John,you've been seeing lot of each other,haven't you? - Yes,certain amount. - Is there some trouble? - I don't know, Sally. - You mean you won't tell me? If I knew,I'd tell you. When I know,I will You promise? I promise. I was free for three nights and then yesterday... Last night... You were in my dreams again,doctor. I wish you hadn't been. Tell me about it I am back to the house. He had to see the stranger. I had to find out what he was thinking,what he was doing About me. About Sylvia. Hello.What brings you here on such an awful night? I knew that sooner or later he would ask me for money. I had only exchanged one blackmailer for another. It was then I noticed the poker. But why, doctor? Why? Why should you be in my dreams? Why should I want to kill you? Will it never end? Will it always go on like this night after night? Don't worry,Preston. It's all over now. What do you mean? It can't be! It can't be true! Come on,Sally. I'll get you a drink. I don't understand,Peter. Why? I had to tell it. There was no other way. Everything was a lie. His whole life. His love for me. I could use a lot of big words which would mean nothing to you. He is a very sick man,Sally, schizophrenic. A man split in two. And the two halves were completely divorced He is David Garrity,deserter, criminal, murderer. He did kill Sylvia. The rest was mostly fantasy. The stranger was not Sylvia's husband. He was a French detective. He'd been investigating Garrity for a long time . But he looked and acted and talked so sure So sane It always happens that way. It's all over now.
