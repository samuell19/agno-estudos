ANGE AND GABRIELLE Evening, Philippe. - OK? - And you? - Fine. Meet Charlotte. - Good evening. Nice to meet you. - Sylvia. - Good evening. A lawyer? - Sorry! - It's OK. It's my back. I'll do it. - Morning all. - There you are. Sign the plans, they've got to go. - When's the meeting? - 15 minutes. They want to see you and... Someone's waiting for you. - Hello. - Angel Pagani? - We've met? - Really? No, I was asking. I'm Gabrielle. We must speak. I have a meeting in 3 minutes. See my assistant. It's about my daughter. Her name's Claire. - "Claire..." - She's 17. She's pregnant. Maybe, but I don't know a 17-year-old Claire, so... Your son got her pregnant and left. See my problem? My only problem is not having a son. I'm sorry for you and your daughter, but I must ask you to leave. - Wait. I... - You're not Simon's father? - I don't know any Simons. You're not Simon Camille's father? - Who said I was? - His mum. I slept with that woman twice! Three times maximum. I wasn't the only one! We lost touch, then she called to say I was her son's dad. I made things quite clear then. I'm amazed that it's come back to haunt me, 20 years later! Why did she say it then? What part of it do you not understand? Your life doesn't interest me. - I want the baby to have a dad. - But he doesn't! What do you want? Make him face his responsibilities. Making girls pregnant like that! - Ask his mother. - I have! But she was completely... She said that Simon was a grown man. For once, I agree with her. That's it! Time to go. I've got loads to do. If you please. - Wait. - What is it now? I've come over funny... Can I have some water? Sit down. Thank you. It's so hot here. Is it gas? - Electric. - That explains it. But it can be good... Fine. Any better? I don't want to make a fuss. But imagine being pregnant at 17? How can it still happen these days? You forget your pill, it's too late once you're pregnant. This time I really must go. It's a sad story, but nothing to do with me. You're quite charming, but you can't stay. No. I won't leave until you've promised to call him. I see. Wait! Here's his mobile number. Just call now, make an initial contact, it'd be great. Your daughter knows you're here? I need something concrete first. Well this is it: Don't expect anything from me. Good morning. Wait! Simon's problem is due to you! Say sorry, tell him to avoid making the same mistake! Can I get in my car? No. Get out of the car! - Let go of it. - No! - Let go of the door! - No! Get out! Stop the car! No, no! Ouch! Bastard! Crazy, completely bonkers! CHEMIST Well? Are you sure it's just lumbago? It hurts more and more often. - What could it be? - I don't know. A slipped disc. Muscular dystrophy. A trapped peroneal nerve. Even if it's the leg. But it can cause paralysis. Well, 1: take an anti-inflammatory for 10 days. 2: stop asking the question on line. And 3: I suggest you take it easy physically speaking, Mr. Pagani. You're no longer 20. Anything else? A boil, a splinter, swollen glands...? What about cancer? I'm home! - Alright, darling? - Fine. Look what I bought. I'll buy something every month. That way, when he's born, he'll have a few things. I'll be alright, you know. Even though I'm only 17... Hello! Oh no! I'm a chemist. If it's haemorrhoids, you need to use a cream. Be sure to eat plenty of fibre. Drink lots. - Why are you here? - I want to show you something. Where are they? - Who are they? - Simon and Claire. - I don't care. - Sit down! It was Corsica, at Easter, before... Nice weather? Claire taken by Simon. And Simon by Claire. - Handsome, eh? - How old? - 21. - He looks 13. He doesn't, he's quite the young man. Slim, very lithe... Look at those lovely eyes! So what? If you look a little closer, you'll see he looks like you. Look at that. It's in the smile. You take me for a fool. Not at all, I mean it. It's not just that, though. There's his presence, his charm... You've missed the opportunity of knowing your son. But I don't have a son and don't want one. Well you should! Simon is very clever and resourceful. He works in a club to pay for uni. - Le Barouf. Know it? - No. You could meet him. I've noted his telephone number. And if you could put a word in for my daughter... Successful business? Right. Let's stop beating about the bush. How much money do you want? "Successful business?" You take me for a fool. Alright, 15,000 euros. Will 15,000 do for you. Eh? But let's be clear, take it and then disappear. Don't come back again. - Get out of my sight! - This is my place. Tragic soul! That's enough of that! Haven't you got anything to do? Should my ear be whistling when I listen? Try stopping listening. It's worrying. Why not meet him for a coffee? It's no big deal. No way. One small coffee leads to a deposit on a flat. I know. It's not about the money. If he needs... If not, she'll return with a gun and pick us all off like sitting ducks. She's capable of it. She's quite barmy. But she was right about the smile. A bit crooked. Idiot... - Mr. Pagani? - That's us. - Follow me please. - Right. Hello? Is this Simon Camille? Angel Pagani? You're late. Can I sit down though...? Yes, sit down, but make it snappy. What do you want? Fruit juice? Lemonade? A coffee. Two coffees, please. Thanks. - Alright? - I'm OK. - What are you studying? - Science, masters degree. Really? Any openings? Yes, yes... Where do you live? My mum bought me a flat in Paris. You've got somewhere. Good. Thanks. Nice motorbike. Very practical in Paris. But they're so very dangerous... I know a talented photographer, got caught between a truck and a bus shelter. His leg was completely mangled from top to bottom. He still hasn't left hospital, bolts sticking out everywhere. Went to see him once, I was in shock for a week. Is that all you've got to say? No. You should just be careful. Especially as you'll soon be a dad. - Did Claire send you? - No. Her mother. She thinks it's my fault if you don't want it. I was quite clear. I don't know what you said... Nothing. I've never spoken about you. It was always quite clear between your mother and me. - She told you, I hope. - It was always quite clear. I might not be the best person to say this, or perhaps I am, in fact. I may not be your dad, but, if I've understood correctly, you certainly are the father of this child. And that changes everything, pal. I understand that you want to stay fancy-free, travel the world, live without restriction... No, I'm not like that. You want to go out, meet other girls... No, not particularly. You're a serious lad. Unlike me at your age... Are you going? I knew it was a bad idea. - Why come then? - I don't know. To see who you were. I was only trying to help. I don't give a damn that Claire got pregnant. It wasn't an accident though, she just stopped taking the pill. It was deliberate? Check your facts before lecturing me. Good afternoon. Here. - Can we speak? - I'm busy here. It'll be quick. I met up with Simon. So now just leave me in peace. It's Simon's father. Can you... - How did it go? - Very badly. But we spoke. So don't ever come to my office... Shit! You ruffled him! But you told me that it was an accident, so that I'd lecture him. - It wasn't deliberate. - Yes, it was! Next time, check your facts before lecturing me. - That can't be... - You're disappointed. You're not alone. Because Simon's nothing special, despite what you said! I found him very arrogant. He was a pretty lousy bet. Impossible! Now I'm certain he's not my son. He's got bandy legs from biking, and a slight squint that isn't from me. In my family we look straight ahead. I did what you asked, now I'm free of it. If I were you, I'd give Claire a hard time, as she's a serious troublemaker. I just told you, it's impossible! That's two slaps. I warn you, there won't be another! - All alright? - Just fine. Prescription! Can we speak rapidly? - Hello. - Hello, Charlotte. What's up? - Did you do it on purpose? - You saw Simon? His father. Answer me. "His father"? Mum, how could you... - You called him? - Tell me! What difference does it make? I don't believe... Do you know what it means to trick a man like that? People are staring. - Why did you do it? - I don't know! I wanted a little baby, something for me. Something for you? - When's the ultrasound? - At 9. - What's wrong? - The baby's got a problem. - Serious? - I don't know. They said it was an IUGR: intrauterine growth restriction. What did he say? Nothing. He's going to do more tests, then he'll call you to explain. - Should we be worried? - Absolutely not! It was just so cute with its little.... Good evening. - Can I come in? - No! And I'm warning you: Slap me and I call the cops! You were quite right. - It was no accident. - I did tell you! Sorry about the slap. Slaps. Plural. You deserved the first one a bit. I'm sorry. I hope you'll forgive me. Goodbye. Alright, I forgive you. Even though it caused slight damage. It's alright, it's only a slight whistling. - The baby's got a problem. - Really? - A suspected IUGR. - What's that? A growth restriction. It's 11 centimetres long at 14 weeks. Is that big or small? It's not big. In fact it's much too small. Come in and sit down. Sit down. Maybe it's not serious. What's it due to? Perhaps the placenta isn't working properly. It could also be an infection, or a malformation... If it's that, then... The baby might not live, which would suit everyone. Come on... Don't say that. It'll get going again. Babies are tough. I was born 10 days early. I don't look premature, do I? Come on, stay hopeful. I blame myself. You didn't force Claire to have this baby. - It's not you. - No, but I was a single mother. Really? Even though for me, it was an accident. I wonder if she's repeating the same scenario. You're no more responsible for Claire's acts than I am for Simon's. Who's not my son. What matters is the baby's health. So tell Claire to look after herself, to eat and really sleep well. It's vital for healthy growth. Thank you. - And stop worrying. OK? - OK. You look good without glasses. Slightly lost and fragile. Feeling better? - Goodbye. - Goodbye. Gabrielle's voicemail. Please leave a message. Hello Mrs Meyer. Angel Pagani here. I looked into the syndrome of IUGR. It seems there's a 70% chance that the baby's problem is due to the mother's psychological state. I thought it might be that. Have a good day. Goodbye. - Miss Meyer? - Yes. Gabrielle's voicemail. Please leave a message. It's Angel Pagani again. I know the medical profession. If you want Claire well looked-after, don't hesitate to call. Goodbye. Damn thing! - Oh! - Perfect timing. Can you help me close? I left 5 messages. Didn't you get them? Click it shut. Damn... Hey! Didn't you get my messages? Yes, but there's no news. In that case, you send a text: "Thanks for your messages. When I've got some news..." Are you listening? It's only fair. You're used to having your own way. People aren't at your beck and call. I called you and you give me a hard time! Claire's just fine, the baby is too. It's almost made up for lost time. You see? It was just a matter of waiting. It takes time to grow big and strong. Ah, my bus is coming! Thanks for the messages. How about a spot of dinner to celebrate it? No. Tomorrow? - Good evening. - Hello. Alright? - You're not wearing glasses. - I don't always. - A little champagne? - Yes, alright. Stéphane. - Some champagne. - Yes, Mr. Pagani. - You come here often? - I like this place. Most women do. The lighting is quite... "Most women." What about you, and men? Out of interest. Are you seeing anyone? I've had relationships. Quite a few, actually... What I mean is... A normal quantity. Nothing... But you're alone now? Yes. And very comfortable with it. I've got my daughter. Thank you. You've never married? No. And you? No way! Not marriage. No children, no wife but lots of women. Simon's mother said that? No. It's written all over you. Really? Why do you fear fatherhood? Did your father beat you? No. He was a very good man. Maybe you feared not being as good as him? You feared mediocrity. It's not that. I don't have the reproductive instinct. Perhaps due to my greater instinct for freedom. Freedom to hop from one woman to another sounds egotistical. Whereas having children isn't? We have them for selfish reasons. All of that is so conventional. Your "freedom" is bound by principles. What's it to do with that? But I am principled. Refusing fatherhood isn't a sign of cowardice. Quite the opposite. Really? Explain that to me. It's easy at first. But gradually with the passing years, all your friends have families, but you're still alone, no wife or children. OK, it's your decision, but it's hard to stick with, to resist temptation. Christmas, the holidays, birthdays... It makes you want to drop your principles, pick up the phone and... Really? You think of Simon's birthday? No, my own birthdays. You think it's fun blowing out candles alone? I don't know why I'm here. You can't leave now. Gabrielle. - Gabrielle. - Ouch! Kiss me. No. You think you're so irresistible? I know you like me. - No! - Gently. No, stop! We can't. I can't do it. Why not? Because... Well, you know why. Alright. Goodbye then. Goodbye. Gabrielle. Tell me when it's born. What's going on? I'm off to Biarritz with Charlotte. - Biarritz? - To her grandmother's. Where's my identity card? You might have the baby any day now. I've still got 15 days. - I won't let you. - Give me my card. - No. - Give it back to me. - No! - Give it back! - No! - Give it! What? It's a girl! You alright? Shall I tell Simon? Hello? It's Gabrielle Meyer. Am I disturbing you? Er... No, no. The baby's born. - Really? - I'm calling too early. No. It's fine. did it go well? Yes, very. It's a girl. Ah, a little girl, that's nice. She's 3.2 kg and 51 centimetres. Is 51 centimetres big? Yes, very big. Her name's Louise. I can send a photo, if you like. - Please do. Well... see you soon. Yes. Goodbye. Goodbye. Thanks. No, she's quite normal. But look at her face. I'm sure there's a problem. - She's odd looking. - Babies all look like that. They all look rumpled. Ugly babies make beautiful adults. She'll be sublime then. - Hello. - Hello, Marie. Reminds me of my nephews. I often looked after them as babies. They loved uncle Googoo. Why don't you have kids? You love them. Need to find the right man first. It's harder for me. You have sex and that's it! - Oh, already? - I'll deal with her. Yes, wait. Everyone's ill at the moment. Gastric upsets or flu, it's one or the other. - What's that? - They're for you. They're outside because they smell so strongly. Here's to mother and baby! Angel Pagani PS: Does the doctor think the baby's normal? It's got an odd-looking face. Shall I bring it in? No. Leave it there. It's not very pretty. - You're right, it's nice here. - Very. - I've just seen a friend. - Meet me at the bar. - What are you doing here? - A friend brought me. And you? I work here 3 nights a week. - What are you having? - Champagne. Two glasses. Doesn't this job get in the way of your studies? - Are they going well? - Fine. How's the little one then? Is she sleeping at night? When was she born? A few days ago. No one told you? I'll show you a photo. They could have called. It's not my... Have a look. Me too, I think she looks a bit odd. It will change, I was an ugly baby. Well... To Louise, then. Leave. I've got work to do. You could try to be friendly. Every time... Just get the hell out! What on earth are you doing? - I beg your pardon, sir. - It's alright... I'm going. I'm sorry, sir. What the hell's your problem? Angel! - You're not staying? - I'll call you. Ciao! I'm leaving. - Is she sleeping? - She'll wake up soon. - What do you suggest? - That you get some sleep. You get up three times a night. See you mate. - Have you revised today? - Not really. She cried all day long. - Go and study. I'll take over. - I'll fail my A levels, mum. I'm totally blocked in maths. Can't put my mind to it. The best thing is to try again next year. No, Claire. You need to try this year. It would be stupid not to. I can wait a year. You can't! You've got to prepare for your future. What will you do without qualifications? If something happens to me, how will you get by? What's eating you? I won't live forever, I'm not immortal. You wanted a baby after all! Do you realise the shit you're in? - Thanks. - Sorry. Why are you here? What's this piece of paper? "In Biarritz for 2 weeks to revise with Charlotte, "even if it's hard to leave Louise. "PS: She had her bottle at 6 a.m." Hello. This is Claire's voicemail. - Well? - She's not answering. After what you said, it's hardly surprising. Who cares about her exams? Exactly. She needs to look after her baby. Shh... I'll go and tell her that her exams don't matter, but that her baby does. - You'll take the baby? - No. - Someone will take her. - Not me! - What with the pharmacy and... - Don't worry. I know who to ask. Go on! Do something! - Behind. - I'm alone! Wake up, you guys! Play! Well done! - Why are you here? - Your flatmate told me. - What is it? - I must get Claire and I need someone to look after the baby tonight. I know you don't want her, but I've only got two hands! Everyone's got to help. Her name's Louise. Oh, shit! Simon, you OK? You OK, Simon? Getting hit on the nose is dangerous. Is he alright? Is he OK? - Why are you here? - We were talking. - It's a bad time. - We're done. Get out of here! Go on, get lost! - It's OK. Play on. - You sure? Alright. Back to the game. Here are the plans. All the bedrooms are at ground level. - That changes things. - It was 3 weeks' work. Hang on a mo. Hello? Oh, yes! Hello! I'm just fine. And you? Yes. And the baby? Wonderful. No, it's nothing... Glad you liked it. Right now? Nothing in particular. Yes. With pleasure. Now? Er... Yes. Where? Yes, I'll note it down. "25, Trap Street." Alright. See you shortly. No, it's really good. I mean it. Super. See you tomorrow. - Hello. - Hello. You shouldn't have. Out of the question! I don't know how it works! It's very small. You tricked me. "Meal at home..." with a name like Trap St, I should have guessed. I've made dinner. There's silver foil over it. "Silver foil"? It just needs reheating. - Right. I'm off. - Please stay. All her medication details are here, bottle times, how many spoonfuls... - It's all here. - How kind. Level spoonful. Use your finger. - The burping's simple. - Yes. But... Final thing: when you change her, clean between the folds, if not, it'll irritate. "Folds"? What folds? Forget about the folds. But change her after every bottle. The next is in 1 hour. It gives you time... - To what? - Must go or I'll miss my train. What? Already? - You're an angel. - Be back tomorrow morning! What a piss off... Bitch. This is Guillaume Robin's voicemail. Leave a message. It's Angel. Come immediately to 25, Trap Street. Urgent. Urgent. Second, on the left. Don't cry. Don't cry. Shh. No, no, no... No. Don't move. That's enough now. I'll get angry. Oh, shit... Come here. What's the matter? Shh... Wait. What are you doing here? - Minding the baby. And you? - Me too. Come in then! - Why's she crying? - Don't know. I've only just arrived, she's wailing like a banshee. - Perhaps she's hungry. - Her bottle's in an hour. I won't last an hour like that. Take her, will you? What's that smell? Shh... Don't move. - Is it too hot? - No. It won't come off. It's like glue. Rub her with soap. There, the washing up liquid. - That's it. - Well go on, rub her down. It's OK... Shh. No, go lower. Shit! Watch what you're doing! - But I am! - You're not! Uncle Googoo. What? Uncle who? Now you're just fine. Lovely and clean. On with your little pyjamas. Watch what I'm doing, because I won't repeat it. Here's your little hand and your little foot. There we are. Little foot is in. Now, how about your little poppers? Yes. Little popper time. There we are. Lovely. They love to be spoken to. - What, in that tone? - Of course. We don't like loud voices. No, we don't... We don't like that at all. There we are. Come here then. Whee! Who'll take her? - You're off? - Yes. To dinner. The two of you should be able to manage. Goodbye little girl. Man-up, lads. She won't eat you. What do we do now? "The bottle." It's bottle time. Is she cold? Don't think so. - You hungry? - Yes. - Chicken and veg or pizza? - Pizza. Sorry. I didn't plan the menu. I don't want to wake her now she's quiet. You're a growing boy. Eat. A spoonful for mum. A spoonful for dad. That's it. Isn't it odd that she left without taking the baby? Luckily baby's dad's here. I only hope she wants to be mum. - Do you fancy a beer? - Yes. Oh, yes. You're really hungry. Come on. Let's go and eat. What do you fancy? Chicken and veg or pizza? Alright then. - Let me do it. - No, I'll do it. No. I'll do it and then go. No. I prefer to do it. At least I know it'll be done properly. You didn't burp her last time. I didn't? Seems as not, it all came up again. OK. I didn't burp her but you didn't change her. At 1 a.m. her pyjamas were soaked. Thanks for coming. You can leave now. Come here... I'm sorry you've taken it like that. I was happy to be here, get to know you a bit. Why? Will we meet again? Perhaps, if we get on with each other. How could that be? Every time we meet, it turns nasty. Go now. I want to be alone with my daughter. Louise. - Right. I'm off. - I'll see you out. He's ruining it all there. No. She's the one being difficult. She won't forgive him easily. - It looks tense, eh? - Yes. Doesn't look good. This time, I'm going. Goodbye. Isn't the sea beautiful? Just look at it. Look. There's mummy and daddy. - Hi. - How are you? - Did you sleep well? - Yes. How about you? Did you sleep well too? OK, Louise? Yes. Looks like you had a lovely sleep. Pass her to me. Come here. Shall we go and look at the sea? Come on. Come and see it with daddy. Come along then, darling. She's getting bigger. I was thinking: I'll give her my room and take yours. Once she starts walking, she'll need the space. I'm moving in with Simon. - With Louise? - Well, yes. She'll go to the crèche, I'll study. Simon's got a restaurant job, so we should get by, if you help a little. Of course. I'm glad for you, darling. Mum's coming. Shall I take her? - Ciao. I'm off. - I'll see you out. - Where are you off to? - Sardinia. I met a guy, two kids... He's an actor. - He did the Nespresso ad. - Seriously? He's the one behind Clooney making a coffee. Are you going away? - No. Don't fancy it. - OK... Come here. - Happy holidays - Thanks. Ciao! - You'll call me. - Yes, mum. See you soon. Don't be sad. Bye, darling. Bye. Bye sweetheart. Bye! Bye! Bye, Louise. Don't know what it is, but I'm tired. Very tired. I'm not sleeping well, and all day long, I struggle to stay awake. Everything bores me. My work, my friends, going out... I don't go out though. The most worrying... Is I feel like crying. Just like that, no reason. Even now, I'm on the verge of... Sorry. I must have an iron or magnesium deficiency... Perhaps I'm low on mineral salts or need multi-vitamins. Perhaps that would do... Whatever. Give me what you want. You know best. Hello. - Are you ill? - No! Nothing much. - And you, are you alright? - Just fine! - And the girls? - On top form. Claire's with Simon now. Really? - You must be happy. - Yes. How's Simon coping with the baby? If only you could see them. He adores her. He looks after her a lot. He's a great father. Quite unlike the father he had. Or rather, didn't have. What's wrong? What have I got? "Prozac"? That means depression? Don't worry. I haven't given up yet. I'll be alright. Me too... I'm taking it as well. Prozac? What's been happening to you? Oh, nothing serious. Just life, that's all. It's hard when the kids go, and it's really hit me. We've always been together, and now that she's gone... And Louise. You get attached. I only saw her that one time, but she touched me. Life's going by so quickly. And you'll get old... and ugly. You'll end up washed-up, and on your own. A bit like that. And you? Same for me. I don't know if it's due to all this medicine, but I'm feeling better already. It's done me good to see you too. - Can we speak briefly? - Tomorrow! Oh! Sorry. See you tomorrow! Hello! - What's all that? - I'm cooking tonight. For how many? Just us two. Why? Leave it... - I told Claire about us. - What was her reaction? Surprised, but happy for me. And Simon? She needs the right moment. "The right moment"? I wish her luck. With his character... Give him time. Here, let me finish this. Excuse me. When did you forget? A month ago. I didn't think there was any risk. - It wasn't deliberate? - No, of course not! Because Angel might think it's a family tradition. I'll explain to him. If he really doesn't want it... Time's up. That was next to the windows! You need to consult the plans. - The screed? - Next week. No. Make it this week, or it won't have time to dry. - I didn't know. - So when will you do it? How are you? Can we talk? I've got something important to say. I'm all ears! I'm pregnant. What did you say? I'm pregnant! He'll lay the screed Friday. There's no obligation. - If you'd rather I... - Angel? OK, fine. Let's do it like that. Fine. Alright. I can't really hear you. Let's talk later, OK? Big hug. Do you understand? Just look at the plans. They're to a scale of 1000th! Can I have an appointment with the doctor, please? Yes, today if possible. It's very urgent, yes. Alright. I'll hold. I'll return as soon as I can. Gabrielle! I just couldn't wait to see you. - I'm off to see the doctor. - Already? It's better not to wait too long in these cases. I'll take you by car. I'd prefer to walk. It's not far. OK. It's not a good idea to come. Why? Because it won't be much fun. It's OK. I want to participate. I'd prefer to go alone. Really. But I want to be there at every stage, to be sure it's done properly, and that you... "Sure it's done properly"? Gabrielle. Gabrielle! What's wrong? What's the matter? Is it the baby? - Don't you want it? - Of course I do. - It's you that... - "That" what? I'm just crazily happy. Just overjoyed. You'll see. This time I'll be there every night, every day, every Christmas, every birthday. I'll read him stories, explain about life... Teach him to play football. - We're early, aren't we? - 5 minutes. Perhaps we should let them arrive first. What did Claire say, exactly? Really! Her exact words. That Simon reacted very well. He may be tense, but if you're diplomatic... Of course I'll be diplomatic. I've planned what to say. Don't worry. Better go, or we'll be late. The baby will only have a year and a half gap with Louise. - They can play together. - That's true. Nice... Eh? - Will it be Louise's uncle...? - Or aunt, if it's a girl. Half-aunt, as she'll be your half-sister. She'll be a double half-aunt, as Simon's half-sister. Eh? Two half-aunts make one whole aunt! Yeah... But to be my half-sister, we would need to have the same mother. Or the same father. And, as everyone knows... I have no father. Quite. This birth is an opportunity for me to become... that father. You too. Well, thanks. But I'm not sure it's such a good idea. Firstly, we'd need to do DNA tests. I want to be sure. I don't just want to be anyone's son. Once that's done, if it's positive... I need to think about it. Do I actually want to become your son? This isn't the ideal time to discuss all this. I'd hoped to make you happy... Why, is it meant to be a gift? For who? For me? Simon, please. Can't we talk about this later on? What do you say, Simon? I'd like to know why you came to this decision. Why? Old age creeping up on you? Guilt? A need to wipe the slate clean before the birth? Stop! If you want to play super-dad, it's awkward having a bastard. - People can change. - Really? Tell me that when he's dumped you with a kid. - Now apologise. - It's alright, I'm OK. Really. I... - I said apologise. - I'm not offended. If she's not angry... What are you going to do? Eh? - Spank my bottom? - Thump you. Arsehole. - No, stop! - Simon, stop! Stop! No! Leave me alone! Calm down. - Alright? - I'm OK... He's crazy... - Little shit. - Old wanker. No. - What? - Old wanker! Again! Well... Thanks for the dinner, see you again sometime. Simon. Sit down here. I've got something to say. If you can listen without getting on your high horse. I don't care if you're my son or not. I don't give a damn... I don't need DNA tests to know I like you. You're not perfect. You're angry, a grudge-bearer, but I appreciate you nonetheless. So if ever the idea appeals... I could try to be a father. Not your father! But, who knows... A companion, a confidante. A friend. - Take your time, think about it. - No! It's alright. It's OK by me. Fancy a drink? Yes. - Put on your trousers. - They itch. No they don't. They look great. Just like that. With a white shirt, just like dad. Look how good that is! That's great as well. You'll be dressed just like dad. We'll look the same. We'll sit you over here. Absolutely marvellous! Jacket now? Don't you look good. Comb the hair. That's very important. And how! The best-looking boy today! Little kiss for dad. We're ready! So are we. Look at my beautiful princess! - Where the hell are they? - They're really late. - There they are! - They're coming. Come on! Quickly, quickly! - We said half-past! - Alright, we're here! Come on sweetie. Where are they? - At long last. - Sorry. Hello, sir. Right! Now that everyone's here, I wanted to say that I'm extremely happy to welcome Guillaume Robin and Xavier Colinnet today, who have decided to marry. OK! Now for the photo, please. No, that's no good. Line yourselves up properly. Close up. - It was a nice ceremony. - Yes. Very moving. It's creased. What do you think of marriage? What, gay marriage? No. The old-fashioned sort: a man and a woman. - Isn't it a bit uncool? - Yes. Let's go on it. Smile! say cheese! Subtitling : Eclair Media
