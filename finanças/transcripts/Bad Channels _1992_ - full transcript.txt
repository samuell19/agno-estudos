(soft music) (upbeat rock music) (ominous music) (electrical hum) (radio chatter) - This is Willis up here at the substations there seems to be a problem here, it must be that new radio station kicking in. I'm gonna check it out. (electric sparks) Holy shit. (screams) (polka music) - We're outside the modest studios of radio station KDUL just about the last place you'd expect to find America's most controversial rock n' roll disc jockey but he's here and this man hired him. It all began when Vernon L. Locknut, KDLU's owner discovered that his tiny all polka station was actually authorized to broadcast nationwide on a clear channel. - That's right, Lisa, we broadcast over 666 kilohertz on the AM band, now because to the superstition about the number 666 we're the only 666 in the entire country. - Thank you Vernon, and so this morning with a new 50,000 watt translator installed and tested chief engineer Corky Bradford threw the switch and super station 66 was on the air. Signing on with this 66 hour marathon shift, rock radios most notorious DJ Dangerous Dan O'Dare, returns to the airwaves after a six month suspension by the FCC. - Hmm, Lisa I've got my radio here tuned to super station 66 and listen to this. (polka music) I thought Dan O'Dare was a rock n roller. - Well, what you're listening to is a typical Dan O'Dare stunt. ♫ Oh how the lady, just loves to feed her boy ♫. - Look folks come on, you're in polka hell and I'm in polka hell but I'm not changing this record until someone guesses the right number, so please ladies and gentlemen pick up your phone and let's get some rock n roll going here. Somebody please, this stuff is killing me. - [Phone Voice] Dan try eight to the right, two to the left, 14 to the right. - Alright 14, no, no, no, no, no, come on people, Lisa what's her face is here for my big interview and the way these chains are wrapped between my legs is making her microphone throb. - [Phone Voice] Hi Dan, seven right, 25 left, 30 right. - No, no, it doesn't work. People I'm trying to give away a sukiyama off road convertible for 20 hours I've been chained to the wall. Just three numbers is all I need, just three numbers, somebody give me three numbers. - [Phone Voice] Chained, huh? Not a bad gimmick, Dan O'Dare welcome to day and night with Flip Humble. - Thanks Flip, welcome to polka hell. - What happens if no one guesses the combination. - I'll die in these chains before I take them off. And this, polka record, will keep playing until the bitter end. But don't worry Flip, I'm sure some moron out there'll get it. - I'm gonna win that convertible. - Peanut, if you don't turn off that stupid polka music, I'm gonna go bug-eyed crazy. - Thanks darling. (polka music) - Damn, Grits, why don't you get a hair cut! - Hey good buddy this is Peanut over at Peanut's truck stop open 24 hours just like you. (high pitched feedback) - Peanut what are you doing a commercial? Turn down your radio. Thank you, now give me a combination. - 16 right, 4 left, 38 right. (exhales) - No, no sorry peanut, we're still locked in here. Look people I have time for just a few more local calls. - Dan your last job in radio got you in a lot of trouble, what on earth were you thinking when you broadcast that live sexual encounter between yourself and KLSO's drive time traffic reporter police sergeant Paula Day? - Like I told the FCC Flip, it was an accident. - A rear ender as I recall. - Bumper to bumper, Flip. (chuckles) I was doing a little shoulder work on the sergeant and she rolled over and hit the on air switch and the rest is radio history Flip. Scuse me a minute Flip, I better take a few more calls. (poor band music) - Bunny, your colleagues are being very patient here, practicing after hours to help you get your part down, the least you could do is give us your undivided attention. - Just a minute Mr. Baker this is really important. Hello Dan? This is Bunny Bonner of the Pahoota Panthers, - You sounds like a real airhead Bunny, can you give me three numbers Bunny? - How about 36, 22, 34. - You sound more interesting than I thought there bunny. (exhales) But no, no sukiyama convertible for you Bunny, sorry. Flip give me three numbers. - Me? - Yeah you why not? - Well for some reason the numbers, a one and a two and a three, come to mind. - One, two, three, (polka music plays) (laughs) I don't believe this. - It opened? - One, two, three, why didn't anybody think of that before? - You mean I win the car? - Nature calls everybody, I'm taking off the restraints now, Woo! I'm no longer chained to the wall. I can reach. The old KDUL AM turntable where the last polka recording on earth has been playing non-stop for 20 hours and 14 minutes. (shouts) Ladies and gentlemen, you'll never hear another tuba horn on this frequency again, Cable world network star Flip Humble did it. The all polka format of KDUL AM is dead, Dangerous Dan O'Dare is on the loose and super station 66 is on the air! Woo Hoo! (rock music plays) - Well, this turned out to be a lucky interview for you Flip? - Yeah, pretty amazing, huh? - Yes, but of course knowing you as I do, you'll probably want to donate that car to charity to avoid any appearance of impropriety. - Time to cut to the news Lisa. In our late, late segment tonight we're going to spend a half hour with Dan O'Dare as he continues his marathon. Right now here's Katrinka Shinkalova with world news update. - The rush of UFO sightings in California is due to weather balloons according to US Department of Defense. (rock music) - Great moment in TV history huh? - You may think so Mr. Locknut, but I am calling the head of programming at CWN because I think he needs to know about this scam. - Scam? What scam? (knocks on window) - Lisa, I'll be back in half an hour with the burgers. - Three cheeseburgers and a diet okay? - Right got it. - I knew there was an angle behind it when I got this assignment, this is the sleaziest piece of reverse payola I've ever seen. - Payola, what payola? - Oh come on, you know what I'm talking about. - No I don't. - Yes you do. - No I don't. - Yes you do. - Hey, hey wait a minute. - Keep that tuner at 66 baby, the only place on the dial where you'll hear. - [Sound Box] The Dangerous Dan O'Dare show. - The only place where we absolutely guarantee. - [Sounds Box] You'll never hear another polka on this frequency. - Now let's take a little break ladies and gentlemen, I gotta go see a man about a dog, how about. - [Sound Box] Six shits in a row on super station 66. - I assure you Miss Cummings that is not the way we operate here at KDUL AM. - I assure you that that is not the way it appears. - Hey, what's going on you guys? - Well she was going to tell me to - You bribed Flip Humble to promote this stupid marathon on CWN, you rigged the contest, ah! - Lisa wait. - Hey where you going? - Lisa wait, Lisa, come on listen. - Look, nobody's going to be shocked by anything you do Mr. O'Dare, but I have my own reputation, my own ethics, I will not allow myself to be implicated in this patently dishonest promotion. - You think I wanted Flip to win that car? The chains and polka schtick was good for another 24 hours, look, I've done some stupid things, I've made a lot of mistakes in my life and that's why I'm out here in the middle of nowhere but this is my one chance to start over, you know, I'm not going to blow that for Flip Humble or anybody. - Well if you and Flip are up to something shady at least it backfired on you. - So the late, late interviews still on? - Yeah, but if I find out this contest was rigged I'm going straight to the FCC. - May lightning strike me if I'm lying. - Look, It's incredible. - What? - Come on, over there. It was like spinning colored lights coming down right over you. (exhales) It's gone. - What's gone? - The UFO. (laughs) We just got buzzed by a UFO. - No. - I've got to go get my camera. - Maybe it was some Air Force deal or something? - Oh yeah, Air Force from another planet! Oh Jesus this is great, a real story I'm right in the middle of it, yes! (shouts) Yeah! Great! - [Mr. Locknuts] Sheriff Hickman what are you doing here? Is there something wrong? - Sheriff, Lisa Cummings CWN News Sheriff. It's a UFO, I saw it with my own two eyes. - Vernon, how do you like that? We've got a UFO right here in Pahoota, and I'm sure you have a witness for this. - Right here. - Sheriff this is my star personality and he's got to get back inside and on the air. - And you saw this, UFO? (laughs) - No, not me, - What? You were standing right next to me. - Well sorry I didn't see it. - Yes he did. - Now Miss Cummings, I hope that you'll be as responsible as this gentleman and won't start spreading rumors and creating a panic. - As responsible as bumper to bumper O'Dare? - [Car Radio] Sheriff Hickman you read me? We got some kind of trouble out at Nut Creek. - How could you say you didn't see it? - Because I didn't. Besides I don't believe in UFO's. - [Car Radio] Weird lights out that way. - Sounds like a lot of people are seeing things tonight. I'm by the sub station now, I'll go check it out. - Sheriff I know it sounds crazy but I could take you to the spot. - Why don't you just stay here on this little spot and you watch those UFO's, I got work to do. (sighs) Oh and Vernon, I'm going to be really ticked of if I find out this is just a publicity stunt. - Hey, hey, hey! - Lisa, wait, what about my 30 minute interview? - I'm gonna miss the biggest story in history to do a puff piece on a DJ? Maybe you can buy Flip Humble with a car Dan, but you can't buy me at any price? (laughs) - Okay, alright, so I promised Flip a car to get on the program but there's a reason. - I knew it why, didn't you say so? - There's a reason and I, can I tell you the reason? - Well please do. - Because not for ratings, it was because it was because he promised to send you and I wanted to meet you. (scoffs) - That is such a load of crap and with everything I've ever heard about you I consider that an insult. - Okay, (breathes heavily) okay, who needs your stupid cable network anyway. I'm going to give you a lesson in the power of radio lady. By the time this is over, you're gonna be begging me for an interview. (slams door) - Would you hurry up? Come on now, we've got a show to do. Let's go. (knocks) Dan? (dog barks) (heavy rock music) (laser blast) - Dan O'Dare back with you in all new clear channel super station 66 and I got to tell you it sure feels good to be out of those chains but hey, don't you miss that polka. (screams) Let's take some calls on our national phone lines, you're on super station 66, - [Phone Voice] Yeah, Dan did that cable TV jerk really win the car? - What a coincidence, huh, on live TV, right there in front of everybody. - [Phone Voice] Looked a little bogus to me. - Yeah, well, sometimes truth is stranger than fiction. Were you calling from? - [Phone Voice] Marshall, Texas what time's that interview on CWN tonight Dan? I want Flip to make me believe that deal wasn't rigged. - Another conspiracy theorist, did Flip Humble win that car fair and square or was Flip Humble the second gun man in the grassy knoll? Did Flip Humble sabotage Buddy Holly's plane? Well ladies and gentlemen I'm sorry to tell you that that live 30 minute interview on the late late segment of Flip Humble's show has suddenly been pre-empted. Miss Cummings simply decided that she had some late breaking news to cover and cancelled the interview and wait, til you hear what the breaking news is. She saw a UFO. (gong chimes) - Yoo hoo Lisa, Lisa Cummings, if you listening to the Dan O'Chan show I want to remind you of ancient Chinese proverb, woman who chase after after little gleen men, have to settle for little gleen pecker. (scoffs) (laughter) - God, that was funny, that was funny Dan O'Dare. - I could, I could, I couldn't. (pants) I couldn't tell what it was, it was so bright. - Willis it's me Sheriff Hickson? - Don't let them take me away! - Tell me what happened. (cries) - I was so frightened I couldn't see, all I saw was this light, I was ba, - Oh my god what happened? - Something or someone assaulted Willis. - It poked me with some kind of rod or something, it was weird, lights, noise, flying saucer. - Miss Cummings will you get that camera out of here? - I'm sorry Sheriff the public has a right to hear this story. - Well, the public will just have to wait until after my investigation. (sighs) - Alright but don't forget, I saw this too. I'm not just an outsider here, sheriff I saw it too. - Willis, when all this happened, before you went unconscious, did this person or thing, or whatever it was, did he bang you on the head? - It didn't bang me on the head I told you, it poked me with some kind of rod or something right here in my chest. (screams) - Where's that guys with my burgers? Sheesh! My cheeseburgers. Where's my diet? - You cannot do this Dan, it is not a good idea to pick a fight with Flip Humble and the whole gosh darn cable world network. - Flip Schmip, are you kidding me? Look at these phone lines. I could build the rest of the marathon around it. Want some? - I'm going out for a few hours. Do me a favor and make sure that he doesn't say anything that puts me into a lawsuit. - Hey, I'm an engineer, not an attorney. - I got three cheeseburgers here with lettuce and tomatoes, you want one? - No, lettuce and tomato are far too healthy. I'm all set. - Great, I'll take care of them. (ominous music) - [Dan] Be careful America, you're listening to Dangerous Dan O'Dare on super station 66. - Dan? This is Peanut again, uh listen this might sound a little kooky but there's two truckers in here that swear they saw a flying saucer circling over Pahoota tonight. - The entire populous of Pahoota is out there tonight ladies and gentlemen. We got truckers seeing UFO's. (canned laughter) Bunny's boyfriend the entire Pahoota football team saw a UFO. (canned laughter) And CWN's puff piece correspondent the distinguished Lisa Cummings, she's out there with his royal majesty, Sheriff Earl Hickman, they've not only seen a UFO why there chasing one. (canned laughter) But it doesn't surprise me Corky, because I always knew that the first place that visitors from another planet would want to hit when they finally go to earth would be, ♫ Pahoota ♫ Home of, - [Radio Voice] Super station 66. (eerie music) What the hell's going on? - I don't know maybe it's an earth quake or something? Holy shit! (equipment sparks and explodes) Don't panic I'll fix it. - We're on the air. - Ladies and gentlemen we're experiencing some technical difficulties, please stand by. (sparks) - Okay, I got it, I got it under control. (sighs) - Nothing but the best for Vernon L. Locknut, eh Cork. (growls) What the fuck? (door blasts open) Jesus Christ! (rock music) What the hell? (growls) - Hey fella, this is private property and you're going to have to pay for that door. - Ladies and gentlemen I hope you can still hear me, there's something very strange happening down here at our super station studios and if this is a joke I can tell you we don't think it's very funny. - It's not very funny. - Do something Corky! - Well what do you want me to do? - I don't know hit it with something. - Mr. Locknut is gonna shit. - Oh my god, look at that, look at that. A real live robot (screams) - Call the cops, (screams) call the cops! Help! Help! (shouting) - I have cooties, oh my god, help me, oh my god! (mummbles) don't do this to me anymore. - I don't know what's going on that's exactly what I'm trying to find out for god's sake. Just get off my back will you Flip? I'm at the hospital and I'm going in. - Take it away from me. (cries and screams) - Will you listen dammit? Moon has disappeared, I'm all by myself here, working on what could be the biggest story in history Flip. Send me another crew before the networks get here and blow us out of the water. - [Flip] Lisa come on, if you want to keep your job, you'll find Moon and be ready with a live interview for the morning segment. (sighs) (shouts in background) - [Dan] Contact Sheriff Earl Hickman at once, we need assistance - 911 help! - Look at that thing! - [Dan] Looks like some kind of weapon. - [Corky] A weapon. He's raising it. - [Dan] Pointing it at us. (screaming) Help, help! - [Corky] Help me, help me. - [Dan] What's he doing? - Ah! What are you doing here? - I'm sorry miss, excuse me, it's important. I just need to listen to this. - [Dan] Ladies and gentlemen I know this sounds crazy but the super station studios have been taken over by creatures from another planet. Nothing would sound better right now than some sirens? - [Corky] Come on man, come on! We need some help in here man! - The big ones got a space suit on, like this big bumpy head, it looks like a turd with a porthole window. (laughs) - There's this little rusty robot and I can see his brain, man, ew! - Corky and I are going to go in for a better look. The big one, he's putting something on the console. It looks like, It looks like a bomb. (screams) (shoots laser) (laughs) - Can you believe this guy? What a maniac! (laughs) - Well, we'll have to run some tests to be sure but it looks like the nastiest case of Tinea Cruris I've ever seen. - Tin- Tinea Cruris? - Mmm Hmm, commonly known as jock itch. - Doctor give me a call when you get the results and be careful about what you say. There's some reporter from cable world news hanging around here whatever you do, don't let her get near Willis. (overhead speaker chatters) - When can I interview Willis, Sheriff? - He's under sedation. - What about reports of other sightings? - We'll check on everything in due time, right now I'm going home to bed. - Sheriff, Sheriff, okay look Sheriff, off the record, is there anything else you can tell me? - Right now, I'm operating under the theory that someone's having fun at the public's expense. - But I saw it. - Lights, just lights, Miss Cummings, weird lights in the sky doesn't mean we're being invaded by flying saucers. - But my cameraman has disappeared, what about him? - If he's got any sense, he's checked himself into a motel which is exactly what I suggest you do. (scoffs) - I'm not leaving here until I get that interview with Willis, Sheriff. - Suit yourself, but when you find out what his problem is, I think you're gonna be disappointed. (engine revs) (light beeps) (sizzles) (robot sniffs) - Jesus, Corky, - What? - Corky wake up. - What happened? - Come on Corky, we got to hide. (growls) Jesus Christ. - Look what they've done to my studio. My transmitter. Its, mmm, it's burning up but I can't turn it off. (bangs on phone) - Ah, phone's dead. People this is Dan O'Dare, I don't know if we're still on the air everything in the studio, all the equipment, everything is covered in this weird green fungus like stuff. Even the door, the door's covered in fungus, Corky and I are locked in here, we can't get out. The alien, and the robot, just a few feet away. Totally preoccupied with some weird equipment that they have with them. Just a minute ago, they zapped me and Corky, now they're totally ignoring us. This phone is lit up, I'm going to try to contact the outside world. Ah, thank god the phone's working, - [Phone Voice] Hey, great show Dan, - You can hear me? We're still on the air? - Talk to them, tell them we need help. - Okay, well listen, this isn't a show anymore okay? We desperately need help here. - [Phone Voice] Not much I can do for you in Nebraska, Dan but if you're free on Saturday night I'd sure. - Hello, Hello? Hello? - You just turned off all the blinkers, we're still on full power. - Hello, we're on the air, hello people, somebody? Please call the cops, call Sheriff Hickman. (robot squeaks) (growls) - Just hang up the phone so I can get a line out, They don't believe me. They think this is just a big joke. - Oh, come on. - I can't even get a line out to call 911. (starts crying) Corky, Corky, you talk to them, they don't believe me, maybe they'll believe you. - Hello, hello out there, this is Corky Bradford, the chief engineer at KDUL, mayday, mayday, we're in trouble up here folks. Father Flanagan, if you're listening I'm not lying this time I'll never drink another beer, I'll never look at another girlie magazine. - Corky, Corky, wait. What the hell are they doing? (growls) (beeps) (electric static) - This son of a bitch is crazier than a tree full of owls. (shushes) - The big one was just punishing the robot, and whatever they're doing it's intense. I'm going in for a closer look. (beeps) (rock music) (screams) ♫ Soul searching for the truth ♫ Stranded on a ship of fools ♫ The ship is tossed on a sea of lies ♫ Who's making up these rules ♫ A false promise, a dirty deal ♫ You'll do anything for power ♫ But you're cut off from everything real ♫ In your ivory tower ♫ Oh no, the whole world's turning to green and lust ♫ Oh yeah, it's them or us, believe what you want ♫ But don't put your trust in black days ♫ So don't put you're trust in black days ♫ - What's wrong with her? ♫ Beware of sleeping dogs ♫ They run with every pack ♫ Well they'll lie right to your face ♫ and stab you in the back ♫ They only want to hide the truth ♫ And dig you deeper in the holes ♫ You better look before you leap ♫ Cuz you can't trust a soul ♫ Well they'd never believe you ♫ They just want to deceive you ♫ Ain't no rhyme or reason ♫ Just don't get taken for a fool ♫ Whoa! ♫ Don't put your trust in black days ♫ It's all in your mind, time after time ♫ - Where did she go? (pants) - Dan, help! Help! Help! - [Dan] Oh my god! They've got this girl, they've got a girl in a jar, a twelve inch tall girl in a jar she just called my name. People, look people you've got to believe me, I know this sounds crazy but I swear to god, it's true. - You've got to hear this DJ on the new radio station Doctor Payne. - [Dan] Tell them what you see man, tell them what you see so they believe us. - [Corky] It's a chick man, it's a chick in a bottle. - [Dan] It's not like any bottle I've ever seen, it's like the bottle is part of some kind of fungus. - This is the guy doing the marathon in chains? - He got out of the chains, now he's being held hostage by an alien from another planet. - I can see the apparatus, I can see the girl, she looks real. (growls) He's looking at her as if she's some kind of a pet. - My god, Dan, that's Cookie from Peanut's truck stop. They shrunk Cookie. I'm getting out of here. - No, Corky! - Help! Let me out of here. Let me out of here, let me out. Let me out of here. Somebody open the door. Help! Help! (screams) - Corky! - Stay away, stay away, get away, get away! (screams) (electric buzzing) - [Dan] No Corky! I'll just be um, (laughs) - This is wild isn't it? - The guys a nut. Get me another swab would you please? (screams) - What is it? - The fungus. - It's reacting to the radio. - Oh my god! (police siren) - Hey. - Alright Peanut, what is going on here? - It's Cookie Sheriff, she disappeared. (men agree) - You mean like she ran off? Like with a trucker or something? - No, she disappeared, poof, just like that. (men agree) One minute she's in there dancing around like a crazy go-go girl or something and then the next minute she just vanishes. (men agree) Next thing we know this crazy DJ on the radio's saying he's got her over there in some glass bubble or something. - [Voiceover] That's the god's truth sheriff. - Peanut, if you believe a word that guy says then you're a bigger nut than I thought you were. - [Police Radio] Sheriff Hickman? (men agree with peanut) Sheriff You've got a code 11 at Pahoota County Hospital. - This is Sheriff Earl Hickman, what is the problem over there? - [Police Radio] Dr. Payne called, he said something about a fungus coming out of his radio? - I'm heading there now. You locate Mr. Vernon L. Locknut and tell him to get his butt over to the station right away. They've caused about all the trouble I'm going to put up with. - [Dan] I didn't know Corky Bradford all that well, we just met the other day when I showed up here to do this marathon. It seems like a long time ago. A little while ago, Corky fought with the aliens trying to rescue a 12 inch girl from glass bubble, he recognized her as the waitress from a local truck stop. Corky Bradford tried to save that girl, the aliens killed him, with electrical shock then covered him in a hairy green fungus. Corky Bradford died a hero I don't expect to die a hero but I don't expect to get out of this situation either. Pretty soon the aliens are gonna start to play that music again and I have this funny feeling that whatever it is they're doing with that strange equipment has something to do with turning into the people that are listening to the station, I think it would be a good idea if everybody turned off their radios, I want you to stop listening to clear channel super station 66. - Stop listening! Oh my lord! What have you gone nuts? (car drives) - [Bunny] Hi Dan, this is Bunny again. - Bunny will you get off that phone and let's get to work. - Quiet Mr. Baker. I love your show Dan it's really awesome. - Awesome? Dammit, Bunny you've got to believe me, turn off your radio! - Well why would I do a thing like that? - Because, Bunny, what are you wearing? - My favorite black mini and the paisley top my boyfriend gave me for my birthday. - Bunny are you in a gym or something? - How did you know that? - Because the aliens have you in their sights, Bunny, they're about to snatch you through the air and shrink you into a glass bubble Bunny. Turn off your radio before it's too late.

(screams) (alien mumbles) (screams) - It's incredible the fungus was actually responding from the sounds coming from this new super station on the radio. - Not now Miss Cumming. (rock music) (gun fires) - A final item in the news this morning, those UFO sightings in California appear to be linked to a publicity stunt, a stunt that Federal authorities are now investigating. Flip Humble will have more on this. I am Katrink Shinkalova. - Good morning and welcome to the morning edition of Day and Night with Flip Humble, everybody's talking about Dan O'Dare, the super station 66 DJ who's got the nation rolling in the aisles with his nonstop marathon UFO hostage monologue. CWN's Lisa Cummings is live on the scene, what's going on now Lisa? - Well Flip we are live outside the studios and if I'm not always properly framed in the picture that's because somehow last night in this mysterious set of event unfolding here in Pahoota, California my camera man Moon Hashimoto has disappeared. And the situation here at super station 66 is growing more chaotic with each moment and strangely enough some of the wild crazy things that Dan O'Dare is saying are actually happening. UFO sightings, strange fast growing molds, or fungus like matter and the baffling disappearance of local women. Somethings going on here in Pahoota Flip and it is no laughing matter. - Whoa, whoa, whoa, hold on a minute Lisa, are you saying you believe all this UFO nonsense? - Let's just say maybe so. - Sheriff Earl. - Excuse me, - Sheriff Earl Hickman here Flip and what we've got here is a hostage situation pure and simple. We believe Dan O'Dare's got one maybe three people held up in there, against their will. Look, this all started out as a silly publicity stunt and it's gotten totally out of control but I'll guarantee you we're here to make sure we get it back under control. - You've got to help me out here please. You gotta do something sheriff, he's gone completely bonkers for God's sake. (intense music) - He's gonna ruin me! - What about Cookie? - Get outta here Peanut. - I'm telling you the FCC has threatened to revoke my license. - How's it going? - It's no use Sheriff, this green stuff seals up as fast as I can cut it. - There's got to be some other way to get in. What about a trap door? Or a skylight or something? - No, nothing, you're going to have to break down the door, sheriff. - Okay, boys bring in the battering ram. (hits door repeatedly) - Whoa wait a minute, something's happening outside the door, oh my god, I might finally be getting some help here. Oh wait a minute, the aliens are onto it, if who's ever outside the door can hear me don't come in right now. Don't come in, don't come in the door, if you come in the door right now you will be killed! - That does it, he's broadcasting death threats! - Wah? - How's that door coming? - Giving it hell Sheriff. (bangs door) - Ah! Look out! (screaming) - How far away is Pahoota? - Why? Do you want to go there? - Lisa Cummings has lost her objectivity, if not her mind, I wanna be there when they drag Dan O'Dare outta that studio. - You could make it for the Late, Late segment but, do you think it's worth it? - Worth it? That lunatic owes me a sukiyama convertible. I'm getting the keys to that sucker before they throw his ass in jail. (chatter) (beeping) - I'm moving in for a closer look. There must be some way to free these captive women. (women scream) People they're getting ready to do it again, turn off your radios people, they're doing it again. This fungus, it somehow enables them to see people who are listening to this frequency. - I'm looking directly into the view finder right now and I see a girl, a very pretty girl, you're a nurse or something, right, you're listening to me aren't you? Okay well turn off your radio. Don't you understand, they tune in on girls who are listening to the Danger Man. Collecting beautiful women over clear channel 66. Turn off your radio! Turn it off now before it's too late! - [Radio Voice] Hi kids, it's the Captain Happy show staring me Captain Happy, let me get out my magic mirror. I see Bobby, I see Susie, I see Billy.

They've got Bunny in there! - Clear channel or not, there'll be no more rock n roll on super station 66. - We've got to get a line in there, - We're working on it. - Well, what's taking so long gosh darn it? - We're getting 10,000 calls an hour here Mr. Locknut. - Oh my Lord! - Sheriff, my nurse disappeared, just like the others. - Hey wait a second Doctor! - Let's go, sheriff, let's break down that door. - Cool off Peanut! - My God, this is the same fungus. It's growth accelerates when exposed to the sound of the station. - Vernon, were you storing any toxic chemicals in the studio? - 10,000 calls an hour? - Pull the plug on the station Sheriff. Cut the power right now! - What do you mean pull the plug? You can't do that, not with those demographics. This is going to be the highest rated radio show in history! - Who cares about your ratings? This is real Sheriff, this is really happening. - Miss Cummings don't start on that again. Dan O'Dare this is Sheriff Hickman, I'm going to give you one last chance son, exit the studio with your hands up. - Yeah, I hear you Sheriff, glad you're out there. I hope you go the marines with you buddy, because I've given it a lot of thought not much anybody can do for me or the ladies, we're history, but there is something you can do to make sure that this never happens to anybody else again, destroy us. Blow the KDUL studio super station 66 off the face of the earth. I'm going to make one final plea, to people who have the phone lines jammed please, hang up your phones. - [Phone Voice] Hey Dan, this is Roger, wow, I can't believe I finally got through. I've been on hold forever. - Get off my phone Roger. - [Phone Voice] Your show is really the funniest show I've ever heard. Wow. - Fuck yourself Roger! - The F word! I'm ruined. - [Phone Voice] I didn't know you could say that on the radio. - Nothing else I say is doing any good, so maybe if I use some good old fashioned obscenity, you know, some of the four letter baby's, they can be used as a noun or a verb, then maybe, maybe then the White House will send a couple of them stealth bombers because that's what it's gonna take to stop these creatures. (exhales) (phone rings) Can you hear me out there you fucking morons? - I think we're witnessing a complete mental breakdown, here. - Mr. Locknut? Or Dan O'Dare? - [Dan] Take us off the air, cut the power! Do something you dickheads! - Dickheads! Great! - Shut up! Just shut up for God's sake! Just shut up! - It's too bad about the girls. What kind of lives would they have had anyway? - Help! Dan! (girls cry out) - 12 inches tall. - [Girls] Dan you idiot, help me! Bottles for Barbie dolls? - [Girls] Help, Dan! - It's too late for me too. - [Girls] Help me! Help! - I've been infected with the alien fungus, I'm gonna go look for a weapon, make one final try for freedom. (sprays) Hold the presses ladies and gentlemen, there's something happening here and it might be good news for the Danger Man! I just sprayed the alien fungus with germosol, it's receding. I'm gonna try some of this on Corky, see if I can spring him from this fungus cocoon. (beeping) This is amazing people, the germosol, is killing the alien fungus. Eat this scrotum head! Woo hoo! Woo! Ladies and gentlemen you're listening to super station 66 where Dangerous Dan O'Dare is now killing the alien. Woo! Woo! Woo! Uh-oh, it looks like the Danger man spoke a little too soon. Okay, alright I'm sorry, I'm sorry, okay, alright. What? What? (alien grumbles) This? What? Oh you want me to speak? You want me to speak? Alright I'm speaking, I'm speaking! I'm speaking okay? La, la, la, la, la, I'm speaking, I'm speaking. Ah, hello, hello, Oh my god they're getting ready to snatch another girl, I can see the people outside the KDUL studios, Lisa! Lisa, I see Lisa Cummings! Lisa I'm sorry you were right, Lisa don't listen, whoa, wait a minute, I'm seeing something here, when I speak I can see you all loud and clear. But when I let our signal fade, the images fade. Aliens are using my voice to aim their machinery. (growls) Sorry, sorry, sorry, ow! (laser blasts) Shit! Lisa, Lisa, don't listen. Lisa cover your ears, no, Lisa! - Golly that's Lisa Cummings. (gasps) Miss Cummings, can I have your autograph? (screams) (beeps) - Bunny! - Oh! - They missed Lisa and got some goofy looking guy instead! (growls) (beeps) (electrocutes) (explodes) He just blew up his own robot, man this dude is fucked! - What's it like in there? What happened? - Bunny! (screams) - The process is reversible. Lisa, Lisa, they're doing it again. Lisa they're going after you. Cover your ears Lisa! Lisa! - Dan! - No! (hits alien in the head) - Stand back people. Back off fella, Flip Humble CWN news. Now where the heck is Lisa Cummings? - She's inside sir. - She made it in? Dynamite! Hey see if you can pick up her feed? - Right away, right away. Flip we are getting a signal from inside. - Clear the way people, clear the way. - Five, four, three, two, one, you're on. - Flip Humble coming to you live outside the super station 66 studios, where the Dangerous Dan O'Dare marathon is coming to an exciting end as law enforcement authorities are poised to storm the building, CWN reporter Lisa Cummings gives us this live report from inside the studio, Lisa? - I don't know if anybody can pick this up but here goes, This is Lisa Cummings live on the scene, I'm witnessing a terrible struggle right now, (screams) (pants) - What the hell is this? (yells) - This she calls a transmission? - You fucked the wrong chick dude! (pops) (rock music) (beeps) (explodes) (screeches) Shit! (screams and growls) - Dan, get me out of here! My god, what is that thing? (grunts) (belches) - Oh! (ladies cry out) - Dan! - Lisa! Jesus Christ! (shrieks) (panics) - Quick take these. - What do you want me to do with this? - Here, take the germosol and spray that scum bag. (growls) Alright ladies, Alright scumbag, Woo Hoo!! Woo! (screams in pain) - [Cookie] Right between the eyes, sucker! - [Dan] You had to come to Pahoota? Crazy little guy! (cries out) - Whoa! (yells) - Woo, you rat bastard! (screams) (growls) (moans) - [Dan] Oh shit. - [Lisa] Huh? - [Dan] Ladies and gentlemen, you're listening to super station 66, where Dangerous Dan O'Dare has just conquered the aliens. Stand back people, we're spraying the door now, move away from the door. Woo hoo, it's really working. (explodes) (screams) (triumphant music) (cheers and applause) - You're in trouble now. - Dan O'Dare. - Have you gone nuts? What have you done? - Cookie! Cookie! I was worried sick about you. - Oh Peanut. - Ginger! (applause) - We made it, woo hoo! (applause) - Dan. (applause) - The publicity stunt which got out of hand here at super station 66, is rapidly drawing to a close. The hostages are free and safe, using some kind of explosive device which was just detonated moments ago, authorities have finally taken control over the super station studio. - Son. - What? - You are under arrest. - Oh, Sheriff! Would you just look in there? - Oh my lord, what a mess. - I can see Dan O'Dare now as well as CWN field reporter Lisa Cummings. Lisa, Dan, over here. Flip Humble CWN news, Lisa another job well done, and as usual CWN is first on the scene. What exactly happened in there? - Well Flip, you will be glad to know that I got it all on tape, all you have to do is figure out how to blow it up! (laughs) - And Dangerous Dan O'Dare, the bad boy of rock n roll, what do you have to say for yourself? - Get that fucking mike out of my face, Flip. (loud pulsing music) (gasps) - Where's Bunny? - Bunny? - Help, somebody help! Help me! Help, somebody, somebody help! Help! (rock music) (ominous music) - It's a cruel world, it's kind of lonely when you're a foot tall, like this girl bunny, the one that got shrunk my aliens. Maybe a visit from Dollman'll cheer her up. (upbeat music) ♫ Dollman ♫
