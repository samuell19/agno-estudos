Shh. You guys, quiet. Gonna find us. Shh! Girls, what the hell is going on? I thought I told you to play outside. We are. In the summer, while it lasts... ...everything's alive. Anything's possible. At least it feels that way. It's so bright this time of year. The ground is warm to the touch. The air is sticky and hot. Everything blooms or drifts or hums. The color of flowers. The taste of ice cream. My friends' laughter. This one time at this concert, the line was so long that my mom made me use the boys' bathroom. There was pee everywhere. It was like a lake of man pee. It was gross. So much of everything feels like it's spilling out everywhere. Like I could drown in all the life around me. Baby powder. My mom doesn't believe in antiperspirant and deodorant. Yeah, we've noticed. Dad used to say, after the fireworks are done on the Fourth of July... ...you can still see them. Their colors stay in your eyes even though the light is already gone. That's how August feels. It's like the good part is fading. Let's put this on the altar. We're going to Terabithia? Of course we're going. It's the last weekend. How can we not go? Sometimes I worry I'll be the last one to get a phone or pierce my ears or have my first kiss. Sometimes I worry I need my friends more than they need me. I'm trying to decide between bubble gum or Jolly Ranchers. But it's harder to be sad when the sun is so huge... Thank you so much. ...and so bright. Well, I was watching this one movie. It was, like, these kids, and they were looking at roosters and hens. And I guess, like, hens don't strut and roosters do. What do you mean, strut? Like the way that they walk. - Give us an example, please. - Yeah, like they walk... I'll go in front and walk like this. You remind me of, like, camp counselors that are like, "Okay, kids! Okay, children!" "Let's go. Line up. Line up." "Quiet. Quiet, Coyote. Quiet, Coyote." Guys, do you guys see that? Who likes jellyfish? They're beautiful. I love jellyfish. They're really pretty. But they sting. I like seahorses. They're really pretty. So do bees, but bees aren't... Sometimes... You know what my favorite sea animal is? ...my house has so many shadows in it... ...it feels heavy. Like it could sink into the earth. But I never feel that way with my friends. Come on, guys. Come on! Summer has no wants. You can go anywhere, see everything. I can't believe you have to wear a skirt every day at your new school. I know. I hate skirts. Yeah. They're so patriarchal. Yeah. I mean, they make me feel like something's gonna literally fly up my butt. I don't know. I think it might be kind of nice. Something flying up your butt? No. Not having to worry about what to wear each day, I mean. If you could change your name, what would it be? I like my name. Lola. Kind of sounds like a song. It means sorrows. I am the Lady of Sorrows. I want a more classic name. Daisy's so plain. It's like being called Dandelion. It's like I'm a weed. Maybe we should change our names when we go to middle school. My name would be something cool like Taylor Swift or Beyonc√©. But like my own thing. You'd hear it and you'd go, "That's cool." Yeah. Switchblade. Medusa. Tangerine. Tangerine? Tangerine? What? It's a great name. So cool. It's a fruit. Every step you take, you're moving forward a moment in time. But what if the opposite were true? What if for every step you take backwards, you move backwards in time? Yeah, I want to go backwards. Not forward. Let's go back, like, two months. Then we can have summer all over again. But what if we accidentally go back too far and we all turn into a bunch of little diaper babies? What if we go too far forward and become old ladies? Then we'll also have diapers. At least then we wouldn't have to go to middle school. We could just sit around eating soup in our rocking chairs. Speaking of soup, I'm a little hungry. It's almost dinner. We better get moving. We've got to pay our respects. Terabithia awaits. Hello! There she is. All hail Terabithia. All hail. We bring you incense and myrrh and gum. Hey! Daisy? What is it? I-I don't know. Oh, my... That can't be real. Of course it's real. Go look. Not me. You go. You go. Somebody... He's dead? I don't think I want to see that. Oh, my God. San Juan Valley. San Fernando Valley. San Juan... San Luis Obispo! That's not even the right amount of letters. - Okay. Okay. San, San, San, San. - San? Stop saying San! New Haven! New Haven, Connecticut! - New Haven, Connecticut! Yes! - We know. Thanks, Mom. Hey, honey. I've got food for you. What Ivy League University is located in New Haven? - Yale. - Is the correct answer. - What is the capital of Connecticut? - Hartford. Yes. You got it. Give me a letter. The puzzle. You'll have ten seconds to solve it. - So what'd you do today? - Um... - Played. Yeah. Yeah. - Yeah? Played where? Just around. Mari's, the park, got ice cream. Are you stressed? You seem stressed. I'm not stressed, Mom. Something happen today? You girls fight? Mom, I said I'm not stressed, okay? Did you take your medication this morning? Mom, I'm fine. You sure? Okay. We have 20 seconds for you. Where's Dad? Oh, he's just, uh... just having his after-dinner... - N. - ...you know. One N. Don't forget to light the candle, hon. What? Don't forget to light the candle! Lola? Hey, kiddo. - Hey. - What's going on? - What's wrong? - Nothing. What are you worried about that you need to burn lavender? Is it middle school? I'd be nervous too. Those are some tough years. In some ways they're the toughest years because it can be so hard to find your center and to know what's right. You know? But you'll make it through. I promise. You believe me? Yeah. Okay. Come get some soup. Okay. Okay. Does anyone recognize him? Daisy. Aren't you gonna go over and take a look? - He's yours. You found him. - No! Don't say that. I don't want him. He's dead. Don't touch him. Settle down. I don't think you should do that. What? You've never seen CSI? I'm just gonna check for ID. What are you doing? What do you mean, what am I doing? I'm calling the police or my mom or both. Don't. Why not? I mean... ...what's the rush? He's not in any rush. You're crazy. Dina's gone crazy. Seriously. I wonder if he suffered. It probably wasn't fun. Dying. Lola? What is it? Suicide. Well, maybe he was pushed. And it was supposed to look like a suicide. I don't like this. It's not funny. It's not fun. Nobody's laughing. You're right. It's really serious. Which is exactly why we have to take this seriously. Cool. I agree. That is why I'm gonna call... - No. - No. What then? I mean, you know our moms. They'll think we're, like, traumatized. First, the cops will ask us a million questions. Then the moms will ask us a million questions. He's somebody's family. - Exactly. - I'm not saying we do nothing. We make a pact to come back tomorrow morning. Do the Law & Order thing. Try and find out who he was. If we can't figure it out by Sunday, we tell our moms. But not before then. I'm in, obviously. Assuming you're all open to consulting the spirit world. I'm not into any of it. Come on. This is our last weekend before middle school. And before you know it, it'll be Monday, first period. She's right. My mom won't let me watch all those shows you're talking about because she says it's always about men killing girls and other men saving girls or finding the dead girls they could have saved. But this is on us. This is our body. Holy Mary, Mother of God, pray for us sinners now and at the hour of our death. Amen. Mom! How long have you been sitting there for? Like six hours. It's creepy. Um, look, I have a proposition for you. I'm not sure how you're gonna feel about it. What is it? Would you like some blueberry pancakes? Meaning would you like for me to make them for you? First of all, yes. Um, second of all, could I maybe help make them? - You? - Yeah. - You in the kitchen assisting me? - Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Insane. I mean, I'll take it. I'm thrilled. Yeah. Mmm. Okay, well, then I'm gonna go start making pancakes if I may. Great. Okay. Thank you. Thank you. All right, goodbye. Before you go, I just had to say some things. They've been on my mind. Well, what is it, honey? Tell me. Well... Well, I should start with, your shoes look really great. So do your jeans. Oh, no. Here we go. Your outfit is perfectly coordinated. I am bracing myself for the worst. And... Yeah. Your hair looks very good. Natural beauty. Can I skip mass this weekend? Your nails are unchipped... What? Wait. No. No. Excuse me. ...and manicured. Excuse me. Please go back. I heard something amidst the compliments that displeased me much. Was it something about mass maybe? Skip it? Can I do that? Please? Oh, my gosh. Pl-Pl-Please? Yeah? Please explain. So, first of all, you said, "Mari, you can have two skips this summer." And I've only cashed in on one of those skips. Mmm. So I'm entitled to a second one. Actually. Um, all right. Well, let's see. I have put that before the judge. Anything else you'd like to say before... Yeah. Yes. And it is my last weekend with my friends. My best friends. With my besties. Before we are cruelly separated, and I go to St. Cecelia's. It's so sad. This is heartrending. And it's the last chance I get to hang out with them. So, please? All right, well, you have really very well laid out the trials and tribulations of Mari. Yeah, thank you. And so now please let me take it to the higher court of my mind and emotions to deliberate. Mmm. I see. Okay, I've decided that I did say you could skip twice. Thank you. And you know what? You're way too good at this. You're like a politician. It's a lot. I'm trying to deal with it. - Thank you. - Okay. Bye. Mm-mmm. Oh, my God. What time is it? Time to get up. Okay. You've got work. Thank you. Thank you for this. Is someone in the shower? I got the bathroom steamed up for you. The way you like it. You did? Oh. Thank you. It's Saturday. I'm your mom. I feel like I should be doing things for you. That's some other family's Saturday morning. I don't mind. Okay, here we go. - Hey. - Yeah. Can I go hang out with my friends? Um, yeah. Yeah, yeah. How's it coming? Something about your colors this morning just feels really off. Yeah? Can I see? If you want to. Sure. Oh. Well, it's not finished. Sure. Okay. Do not blame me if you don't like it. This is your essence. Okay, Mom. Really? It's summer. You're gonna love middle school. It's amazing. Like maybe the best time in a kid's life. - Really? - God, no. It's the worst. Like literally seventh pit of hell. Well, at least there's my friends. You think that until they're not. Just wait and see. The mean girl thing might not start for another year, but... My friends aren't mean. If you look at your friend group and there's no mean girl, well, mean girl is probably you. You'll see. Everything changes. And I'm not just talking about training bras and body hair. I got to go. Burgers don't grill themselves. Your dad set up a super fun rocket launcher in the backyard. Um, maybe for a little bit. We're about two minutes from the lift off. Okay, okay. But after that, I've got plans, so... - Everything okay? - Yeah, yeah, totally. Did you do your math facts? - No media before math facts. - I did my math facts, Mom. And have you finished Tuck Everlasting yet? You had a goal of 30 books, and last I checked, you were at 29. Almost. I just don't want to get to the sad part, that's all. Well, how'd you know about the sad part? Because I have a stupid sister. I'm right here. Well, sometimes the sad parts make the happy parts matter more. Let me know if you're gonna spend the night. Okay. I think that's the plan. Probably at Dina or Lola's house. Okay, but just remember I have a double shift, so I'm gonna be super late, so I need you to message me or something and let me know where you're gonna be. I will. Ugh. Okay. Have a nice day. You too, Mom. Be safe. Do you want a ride? Uh, no, I'm fine. Okay, you sure? Okay. Good, 'cause I'm so late. 100 feet. What? I did some research. That's how high the bridge is. That's high. My brother says there's nothing more satisfying than peeing off something high. But I guess we'll never know. A lot of people killed themselves here. I read it on Wikipedia. During the Great Depression when everybody got poor. Do you think he was poor? The man. He was wearing a suit. I saw a suit at Goodwill that cost $5. They say the nickname is Suicide Bridge. How is that possible? What do you mean? It's not like it's hard to jump. Like, I mean, it's right in the middle of where we live. How did we not know about it? There's probably a lot of things we don't know. This bridge is for sure haunted. Wait, when you were researching the bridge, what were you using to look up all this stuff? The family laptop. What? Your mom is a total psycho helicopter parent. She's gonna see your browsing history stuff about suicide and get all freaked. Oh, crap! Remember you got that scratch on your arm and she was convinced you were cutting yourself? She's probably already called your therapist. Oh, crap! Crap! Crap! I... Maybe she won't see it until later. You know, after. We need to move him. What? Why? For the same reason that Dina shouldn't have used the family laptop. Somebody's going to see before we can do what we need to do. What's your problem? There was a fly eating him, and then I was afraid that it might eat me. Do we have to worry about germs? Well, you know, on this one crime show, a woman made out with a guy at a bar. He pressured her to go home with him. She said no. Then, like, two days later, she developed this weird sore in her mouth. So she went to go get it checked out, and the doctor called the police because the tests had shown that she'd eaten human remains. I know. So of course they track the guy down, and he had a basement full of bodies. She would have been next. So yeah, germs, definitely a concern. My mom uses them whenever she chops jalape√±os. This feels wrong. Who ripped one? Was that you, Mari? - No, it was not me. - I think it was him. Ew. That is so nasty. It's death gas. Well, come on. Let's hurry up. I think Daisy was right. About what? I think he was poor. Maybe even homeless. What is it? It's his wallet. What's that? A restaurant? A bar. How do you know? I know. So we should go? To a bar? That's what they do on those cop shows. I mean, I guess I can map it. See how far away it is. Take a picture of him first. A picture? That's just wrong. He's not him anymore. Think of it as, like, taking a photo of a pot without a plant in it. Yeah, she's right. We do need a photo of him if we're ever gonna find out who he is. Unless you want to carry him around in your backpack. Fine. Pick him up. And use a filter so he won't look quite so dead. Do you think he was a good person? What? I said, do you think he was a good person? Oh, um... Does it matter? I mean, if he killed himself, it might have been because he did something bad. What if we're wasting all of our time for nothing? No. I don't think so. He was a good guy. How do you know? Because most people are good. Have you ever actually met a person who's really truly bad? I guess not. Bad people are just on TV. Right? What are we even doing? They're just gonna kick us out. Come on. They'll think we're cute. Um... Hi, um... Oh, please don't tell me one of you are here looking for your father. That always breaks her heart. Always breaks my heart. No. We are here... We're ghost hunters, and we hear that this place is haunted. Well, we've got a lot of spirits. Spirits. - They didn't get it. - I got it. And I appreciate the double entendre. Look, ladies, if you're just knocking on doors for a goof, this isn't the place for you. We're not. We're in the right place. - Don't I know you? - Show her the picture. I swear I have seen you... Show her. ...somewhere before. Um, here. Okay. What am I looking at here? Is that the ghost you're looking for? That's not a ghost. That's a man. Is he asleep? He's dead because he's a ghost. Is he dead or is he asleep? He is asleep. He... He... Asleep. Mm-hmm. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. You know what? I do think I know this guy. - Really? - Yeah. He used to sit at the end of the bar down there. An occasional day drinker. He wasn't a regular, but he came in enough that he looks familiar. He drank bottom-shelf whiskey. Didn't really talk to anyone. He did mention his name once, though. - Bob. Frank. - Um... - Joe. Bob. - You already said Bob. - Ed. - Would you stop? You're just shouting out random names now. Mahone. I don't know if it was his first or his last. I mean, probably his last name, right? - Probably. - Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Greg Mahone. Bob Mahone. Would you stop with the Bobs? Do you remember anything else? Um... Oh, he played video games. - Like a... a Switch or... - A what? A Switch. No. Oh. Oh, yeah. Okay. My mom used to play that when she was a kid, I think. I don't think my mom ever played video games. My mom won't let me play video games. My mom only lets me download games that are educational. Go! Go, go, go, go, go! - You have to get it three times. - Go! - How are you doing that? - I don't even really know. My strategy is just to push the buttons fast. - Watch out! Watch out! - No. No. No. That's unfortunate. Wait. Look. Hey, um, you said his name might have been Mahone? - Yeah. - Come look at this. Now I remember you. How's your mom? Fine. Um, uh, Mahone. See? Oh, well, look there. His last name is Mahone. What do you think the H stands for? Henry. Holden. Do people still name their kids Holden? Um, Harry? Hector. Harold? Bob! Hey! What did I tell you? Howard. His name was Howard. Like I said. Now that we know his name, we have to do more research. Yeah, but I don't understand why we need to go to the school. Because everything I do on my phone, my mom knows about. She has the stalking app. See? My mom's not the only one who's crazy. She pretends like she doesn't look at it, but she does. Constantly. She knows everything. I can tell by the way she brings stuff up. Asking if I need new socks if I've been looking at goofy cat socks on Pinterest, that sort of thing. Then why can't we just go to the library? They have computers there. Because one of the librarians there is a family friend. She goes to our church. She knows I'm only allowed in the middle grade section. The computers are in the adult section. She'll notice, and she's super nosy. Oh, no. Oh, God. - What? - It's her. It's Mom. Do you think she knows? She probably knows. Just, um... - Just answer it and find out. - Okay. Shh. - Mom. Uh, hi. - Hi. What are you doing? Yeah, I'm at Dina's house. My house? Um, yeah. We're just reading and stuff. Don't say reading. We'd never hang out and read! Shut up. Um, yeah. We were probably gonna go on TikTok or watch a movie later, if that's okay. What was... What? I don't hear anything. Daisy, move. - Daisy, move it. - Daisy. Oh, yeah, I hear it now. That's... No, no, that's just the TV. Oh, I have to go now. Talk to you later. Bye. Daisy, what were you thinking? We're reading at my house? Seriously? I know. It was dumb. It was dumb, all right. I don't know why I said that. Are you okay? I mean, now she's definitely going to check the stalking app. She's gonna see I'm not there and... - Um, what do I do? - Um... What do I do? Do I answer or... I mean... Don't answer it. I can't believe you just did that. That was... That was my Christmas present. My only Christmas present. We can get it fixed. I just saved you. That's what I did. Dina, you didn't save me. You have screwed me. No. You know, in some cultures, if you save someone, you're responsible for their life forever. - Is that actually true? - Oh, it definitely is. Really? Because sometimes you say weird things, and they sound just, you know, a little bit made up. Just a little bit. Your family believes in facts. My family believes in truths. There you go again. You heard her, right? You're my responsibility. My phone. I mean, that was, like, my life. How am I gonna call my mom back? I mean, you already lied. Just... lie again. Say some, like, guy stole it or something. I don't know. At least you had one. Hi, this is Mari. Leave a message. Laters. Hi, Mari. Um, listen, I don't understand why you're not answering. I know you're not at Dina's. I know you lied to me. I'm very confused, and I'm upset, and I'm worried. Okay? And I really need you to call me. All right? I'm trying to keep my shit together. You can get mad at me about that later. But I'm trying. Um, I don't even really know what to say. Just please call me back. Thank you. Hi, this is Mari. Leave a message. Laters. Hello? Hi. Yeah. It's Stacie. I was just wondering... Hello? This is Stacie. Hi. Yeah. Here's your license and registration. Here's the bad news. Try to be a little more careful next time, okay? - Hello? - Hey. This is Stacie, Mari's mom. It looks small. How does it suddenly look small? It's bigger on the inside than it is on the outside. The window in Mrs. Garcia's room doesn't lock. Brent Schoonover broke it two years ago. We can crawl in there. Is this stupid? Maybe this is stupid. I mean, it seemed fun at first, but now my phone is ruined, my mom knows I'm lying, and we're thinking about breaking into a building. We're not breaking into anything. Brent Schoonover is the one who broke something. I guarantee you we're in serious trouble by now. Then what's the point in stopping now? It's called asking for forgiveness. Jesus. Seriously. I'm being serious. I mean, we say we're sorry, and we end this now. No. After my dad disappeared, that's when my mom just checked out. She never tried looking for him. She never seemed to worry something might have happened to him. Well, what if she knew something? What do you mean? What if she didn't look for him because she knew something about why he left? He didn't leave. You don't leave and not say goodbye. Well, sometimes adults know things but don't tell us. You can't not look for someone who's gone. Someone is waiting for this guy to come home. So, no, I don't think this is stupid. And I don't want to stop. What? The first thing we need to do is download a TOR browser. What's that? It's a browser that allows us to surf anonymously on the dark web. The what? It's basically like the dungeon of the Internet. Why don't you just use Google? Oh, yeah, I'm gonna do that too. But the data mining goes deeper and wider in search engines like Pipl. You sound like you're just making stuff up, like you're auditioning for C or something. We are so using Google. We should also do a s√©ance. Guys, I'm serious. There's more to this world than just what you can find in a search engine. Okay, well, while you're figuring out all this nerd stuff, I have to pee. Um, get me a pen. I think I got what we need. We need to get out of here now. Hey, why are you weirdos running? You wouldn't believe me. Try me. What do you think? I think that is a very interesting story. And also, you... Oh, my God. Ow! I got a brain freeze. Sugar is like cocaine for 11-year-olds. You all out of your minds. You don't even believe us, do you? I know that whatever rainbow unicorn Narnia kids' stuff you're chasing seems important, but it's not. I thought your sister was cool for giving us free food, but she actually sucks. She thinks she's a grown-up or something. I mean, this isn't just us playing pretend. This is real. Yeah, um, do you want to see? 'Cause seriously, we have photos if you don't believe us. Carol! Yes, Mr. Peterson? Can you help with the computer? It keeps freezing when I try to save this accounting spreadsheet. Boomer problems. One second. You're all gonna look back on this moment and realize just how dumb you were. But it doesn't mean you shouldn't have fun. Bye, girls. I hate teenagers. I think, like, Old Town, start there. And then just some... ...spotlights for the alleyways. Memorial Park, Central Park. Get some guys on the ground there. A bar? I mean, what were they possibly doing at a bar? Tequila shooters? No. I mean, I'm joking, but now that I think of it, I remember sneaking some whiskey from my dad's stash at a sleepover in the fifth grade. I mean, I know what you're saying, but Mari just would not do that. I know her. Well, I didn't think my daughter was secretly watching all the murder shows I can't seem to get enough off. So I guess we were all a little clueless. Yeah, but... ...Mari's kind of a prude. Like, she gets mad at me when I swear. She walks out of the bathroom when I pee in front of her. You pee in front of her? Well, not like every day, but... Okay. Yeah, that's what I figured. You know, it's happened. Lola and I sauna together. Or it has something to do with a boy, right? Has to be a boy. I mean, that's reductive and would be disappointing, but yeah, it's plausible. Yeah, just let us know. Yeah. We'll be standing by. Thank you, Frank. All right. Bye. Laura. No, I'm actually good, thank you. I'm good. Um... What's going on with our girls? I wish I... I wish I had an answer for you. Did Daisy say something to you? Has she done anything off lately that might clue you in? What are you thinking? I'm thinking I haven't really paid attention to my daughter in, like, a year. Like really paid attention, you know? So I couldn't even answer that. This place is totally sketchy. Yeah, I don't really feel like being mauled by a guard dog. A s√©ance would be way easier. Okay, if this is a bust, we'll do your stupid s√©ance thing. What do you think he keeps in there? Probably bodies hanging from hooks. Stop. What if it's treasure? Imagine, like, piles and piles of gold coins and jewels and stuff. So cool. When my great-grandma went to the nursing home, she had one of these, but it was just filled with dusty old antiques. Did you hear that? I told you there'd be a dog. I don't... I don't think it's... Can we hurry please? Yeah, yeah, we're close. Um, six, seven. Got it. Are you kidding me? I knew this was bad. I really think we should go home now. No! No? I mean, what other option do we have? Do you have a toothpick or something? Holy shit! I'm leaving. Whoa, whoa. Daisy. Daisy! Daisy! Daisy! What are you gonna do? Shoot the ghost? You can't shoot a ghost. Really? Of course you can't shoot a ghost. You know, I can never tell if you're joking or just crazy. Don't call me crazy. That's patriarchal bull! Oh, my God. Wait. Wait. Move closer and, um, wait for the lightning next time. Now! That was so badass. That was so cool. - Yeah. - Yeah. Two, three... I think he had a family. I don't get it. He lived here? Well, it was 99 bucks a month. I'm three months older than you. What? You remember when that used to be a big deal, the fact that I was three months older than you? Yeah. It used to be better to be older, but now it doesn't seem all that great. Adults are always asking me what I want to be when I grow up. Yeah? They always seem to really care. Well, what do you want to be when you grow up? A UPS driver. What? Seriously? You sound like a grown-up. That's what they always say to me too. But hold on. Are you telling me, out of all the jobs in the world... I mean, movie star, soccer player, president, whatever... You want to be a UPS driver? Why do you want to be a UPS driver? You bring people packages all day. It's like being Santa. Yeah, Santa in gross brown shorts. But what about a rock star or a YouTuber or, I don't know, a veterinarian? That's the kind of stuff we used to say. Feels like we're past that phase now. Phase? What phase? I'm trying to be realistic. In case you haven't noticed, growing up isn't great. It's time. Why Daisy's house? To talk to the spirits, we need to go to an in-between place. A broken place. Then it's easier to hear through to the other side. Then this is the place. It's supposed to be a perimeter of salt, but I think sugar will work just as well. I'm trying to figure out the science behind this because salt is made of sodium and chloride, and it's ionically bonded, whereas sugar on the other hand... Shh! Ow! Nobody is allowed to leave the sacred circle until we are finished. No matter what happens. Do you understand? Yeah, yeah, yeah. I'll follow the hocus-pocus rule book. I'm not gonna leave. I mean, we're in this together. We each have to pay death for him to take us to the other side. Pay? Yeah, seriously, come on, Lola. Ow. You have CSI, I have Ghost Hunters. I know how this works. You choose what you pay. Now what? Now we invite him to join us. How do we... Mahone. Howard Mahone. Do you hear us? If you hear us, give us a sign. Maybe we should all close our eyes so we can concentrate better. So we can all be in harmony. We found you for a reason. Help us understand why. He's listening. Ask him something. Mari? W-What am I supposed to ask? Anything. Okay, um... Is there something else out there? Something better? I guess I'm asking what's next? Dina. I don't have any questions. Dina! Seriously, I can't think of anything. Dina! Fine. Fine. Um... I don't know. How does this... How does this even work? I mean, I was gonna ask, "Will I ever fall in love?" But... that's dumb. So, I guess, will my parents ever stop bugging me constantly? Daisy. Can you bring my dad back? And if not, if you can't do that... will we be friends forever? Now it's time for my question. We found your body, and we know your name. What do you want us to do with these gifts? I saw him! It's okay. Don't be afraid. He wasn't there, was he? Yes, he was. It's just us now. What do we do? I don't know. - Daisy! What are you doing? - Please, sit back down. Sit down! No. Stop, Daisy. Daisy! Daisy, just sit down. Hey. I didn't think anybody would be home. I should have called. Is your mom here? I, uh... I just came to pick something up. I'm gonna... I'm gonna get going. I shouldn't have come, but... Where have you been? It's complicated, Daisy. You should talk to your mom. Okay? I'm sorry. Don't leave. We can't stay here forever. Maybe not forever, but a little while longer. Mom. Hey, can... Daisy. Daisy, where have you been? Where have you been? - Where is she? - Just at our house. You're at our house? Oh, my God. Okay. Um... - They're at home. - Oh, my gosh. They're there. Hey, can I have a sleepover? A sleepover? Are they with you? Are your friends with you? - Yeah. - They're with her. They want to have a sleepover or something. - They're there. - Thank God. - Um, Mom... - Honey, yes. What is it? He was here. Hey. Hey. D... How... How do you feel? Just that? Do you wanna... Why didn't you tell me the truth? That's fair. Um... I really, um... I tried. I did. You really should have told me the truth. I tried. If I... If I had told you, Daisy, then... then it would all... then it... then it's real. And I... you know... I wasn't ready for that. But you're... you're right. Was it because of me? Was it my fault? No. Good God. No. Why would you say that? He didn't want us. I do. - I want us too. - You do? Good. 'Cause that's what you got. Oh, man. You're a good one. You're a good one too. Thanks. Hi. Hey, can I... Let me... Let me help you. - No. No. No. - No worries. Man, I feel like, you know, you reach a certain age, and suddenly you sort of forget to make new friends. - You know what I mean? - Yes. It can happen at any age. Thank you. Thank you. We were just like them once, right? I mean, do you remember that? - Don't know. - God, I do. I-I like to think so. But I don't really remember. Man. You guys. In the fall, I guess some things die to leave room for new things. I don't know if that's a good thing or a bad thing. It's just a thing. It's just the way it is. Can we all keep hanging out? He's gone. Our tree. Maybe he was never really here. I don't want this weekend to end. I don't want us to end. I love you guys. I love that I get to be alive when you're all alive. Let's never not be friends. Okay?
