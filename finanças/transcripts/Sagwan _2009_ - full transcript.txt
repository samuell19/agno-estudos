- You are quick sir! - Thank you! That's how I am! How about me sir? You hold it there and collect. Where did Marimar go? He could be waiting around the corner. Let's go! What did you do to Sir Raven, Nato? Why does he have so much glow all of a sudden? Hmp! Don't patronize me! Hold on a little while sir! Did you enjoy, sir? Well of course! How much? Same rate as usual, sir. Thank you very much, sir. - Psst, hey! - You go ahead, I'll give your share later. Check out your boat. Taliyah has been looking for you. These boys... what scent of money can do to them. Ah... I just saw Eman he's available now. - Never mind. I'm going back to Manila now. - Are you sure, sir? Okay, let's go. Nato, wait up! We'll take your boat. That's the secret of Tatalon River. It's amazing. That's what most tourists say. The river and its boatmen are so alike. Clean... calm... Water that comes from the mountain springs... that flows freely from down the dam... where our famous Tatalon Hanging Bridge is. Hey, where's my share? Nato, give us a blow out! - Why, what's out there? - Oh, no, miss, a cockpit. Cockfighting here in Tatalon isn't like the usual. How about you, miss, do you like cockfighting? Oh, no... My father said, lucky are the people of Tatalona. For they are blessed with this river. This is where he met my mother. This is where they made love... This is where I was raised... where I was honed... My name is Alfredo Paradiso. Alfred to my friends. My life has been like these for eighteen years now... I've been searching for my destiny for eighteen years now. I've been pure to this day... a virgin man they call it... It's not because I don't feel horny at all... Who would refuse the joy of ejaculation? I feel that the river just won't let me. My mother taught me to fear. This river is my source of livelihood... the source of my being... myself and my paddle... SAGWAN (PADDLE) - Are we here yet? - Yes, ma'am, we're here. Hold me, please. I might slip down the mud. - Have I paid you yet? - Yes, madam. - Where's the Hanging Bridge? - The Hanging Bridge is to your left. You pass that route to the hanging Bridge, madam. Oh, I see, its beautiful. Thanks again. - Will it take you long madam? Should I wait for you? - No need. - There will be other boats, right? - Yes, madam. - Okay, thank you. Miss, you can take my boat when you come back. Alfred, Cecilia has been looking for you. Hush! Don't spoil my chance to earn. I'm not trying to spoil it. You're good looking enough. You are Mr. Tatalon, you can spare her to me. - You fool! - You're the fool one! Treat me for a drink when get a customer later. Sure bro, why don't you do the same? Are you crazy? You know I don't fool around. - Even I and Cecilia haven't... - Haven't what? Fool around? Stupid! Those who don't feel horny are dead! There's right time for that, bro. Times have changed. If you don't keep up, Cecilia will... What does time go to do with Cecilia? Okay, you feel my heartbeat... It's so fast it could win you over Cecilia. It's your growling tummy not your heartbeat. This is how my tummy sounds. This is Eman, my childhood best friend The best selling boatman of Tatalon... not because of paddling but from his many sex clients. Popular among tourist, they keep coming back for him. I'm back, are you ready? They say Eman looks always horny. Oh! Are you guys done? Alfred, don't forget Cecilia is waiting at the pier. You ask Nato for a treat when you see him. He's had early clients. It's Sunday once again I'm sure everyone will be busy. Expect a lot of tourists. No one will have time for church... Believe me. If they don't stop abusing our nature. Water will dry out from our river... and when that happens the entire Tatalon will vanish... - You look like me now. - Hey, Ka Celso! What testament did you read that from? We've provided livelihood to most people in this town. Taliyah provided jobs for our young men. How else would you want us to care for nature? What kind of caring do you do? Take your gay boss, Taliyah as an example He used to be a good, sincere boatman. He turned out to be this pervert pimp. Perverting the entire town. A sin to Mother Nature and in the eyes of God! Where are you going, Cecilia? Go ahead and come back right away. I'm going to the hanging bridge come with me. Hey! Why are you still here not tending to tourist? - Just finished serving one. - Lucky you... Cecilia, why are you late? Give me some brochures. Okay, take these brochures. Distribute them to tourists, okay? You stay for the meantime and have some coffee. Stop that boys! Stop harassing Cecilia! She's our most beautiful tourist guide here in Tatalon. And I like her so much because she's my key to heaven. And I will take her to heaven. Know what? Alfred is lucky to have her. Why, because she's mute and couldn't nag? Ok, you go ahead. Psst, Rey. Why couldn't Cecilia talk? Is she tongueless? Cecilia isn't mute. She stopped talking when her mother passed away. Her Father. Ka Celso, said she can actually talk. She only decided not to talk because of what happened... and there's this rumor... That the reason why she stopped talking... is because she saw her father, Ka Celso, kill her mother. That's not true, Taliyah! That's why it's called rumor because it isn't true. Stupid! Why are you wet? The river's running wild. That's why. Did you pimp yourself? Tell me... Why would I do that? I won't sacrifice my integrity for a cellphone or new clothes. What for? To communicate with you? We see each other everyday. We are neighbors. Have you eaten? Not yet. I prepared lunch at home, come. I'll swing by my house. It's almost noon. Are you guys playing? This is work not a holiday! There's a lot of tourists over there! Why don't you try it here in water? You'll see how difficult it is here! Alright. Let's get to work! Wow! What a view! Hey Sisters! Do you like the view? Hey, Mr. Body beautiful. Do you go to the gym? Oh, no. Miss, this is just from my daily paddling. Hey, sisters, look! A sexy boatman! Oh, from paddling... Do you have American blood? No, not American... German! German... Sisters! What'are you waiting for? German? So you're German cut! Hey Sis! He's German Cut! Can you take me to the rocks? You're friends might wanna go to the rocks too? Sisters, would you like to go to the rocks? I think these boys want you, not me! Go, Sisters! Don't waste your time! Hey, old man! Come and take me to the rocks! I knew it! You lost again. What do you get out of cockfighting? You lose more often than winning! I'm always the only one working for money! Can't you do something more productive? Stop convincing me to go with Eman... I won't sell myself! We survive anyway without me doing it. Look at your mess! It's been here since this morning. You can't even wash them. This is all that father has left to me... his cock's metal spurs... I don't know why Cecilia take care of me this way. In fact, she is a picture of a good housewife. She works hard, she's pure, and obedient to her father. Although she's seems weird at times. Every time I dine with her... I feel like I am Jesus... and she's Magdalene. This is our situation almost everyday. If not for my being their tenant... I'd think she treats me like a husband. I don't understand what joy it brings her... serving me this way... watching me eat... look at her... the way she stares... the way she smiles... If she wasn't my girlfriend, I'd think she's doing this because she wants something from me. Why is it that when you look at a statue... it seems to be looking back at you... Watching every move you make. Waiting to see you if you do right or wrong. My god is not that way. Oh... I'll go ahead... there's someone waiting for me at the pier. Thanks for the lunch. BOAT RIDE FARE PhP 30.00 I bet you'll enjoy this time... You'll moot the new good looking ones. - Good afternoon, Ka Celso. - Taliyah, seems like you're playing devil again. Oh, Ka Celso... can't you just appreciate my good hello? And do I look like a devil? Look at me... Don't I look like a goddess to you? I am Taliyah... The one and only goddess of Tatalon! Lightning will strike you if that's the case. - Have you seen Cecilia? - She said she was going to you Yes, Cecilia was in the shop earlier. I hand her some brochure. - She must be by the hanging bridge now. - Are you on your way to the hanging bridge? - Let me take you there. - Oh, yes, we are. But Sir Mark has already paid for Eman. So we gotta take Eman's. - OK, we'll go ahead. - Alright, you take care. Hey Tado, have you seen Eman? He's waiting for his tourists at the hanging bridge. - Are you waiting for a passenger? - No, do you need a boat? Hold on... Sir, would you rather take this instead? - Come ride with me. I just had a shower. - Sure. Know what? If you take this instead... He's got bigger paddle than Eman. He also has a different rate. His boat charge is 150 pesos. Give me 200 pesos, the extra 50 is for me. Ok, Tado you take extra care of Sir Mark. Tado! Will you? You enjoy yourself, Sir Mark. See you later. You assist him well. Taliyah! I'm here. Where's Sir Mark? My gosh! Why are you late? I gave him to Tado instead. - What? - Sorry, next time. Taliyah, can you give me a pack of nuts? Just put it in my credit, will pay you later. You're over your limit. It's time you paid up. I'll pay up! Thank you! Cecilia, why are you alone? Didn't you meet up with Alfred? Why do you seem sad? Nope! In your opinion, does your friend truly love me? Alfred? Of course he does. As if you don't know him. He's been the secretive type since we were kids. We couldn't tell when he's happy or sad. But when he says he loves someone, it's for real. There are times when I don't get him... I'm sure he's not gay... But then, he fears gay people too. We had a talk earlier. I told him how times have changed... It's the women who go after the men now in the city. Why don't you follow that trend? Be more aggressive... If he doesn't give in... I'm here willing and able. Hi! Cecilia! Look at this. This is what I'm gonna wear for the pageant tomorrow. Don't you think it's fabulous? How about you Eman, what do you think? I know it's lovely, but wouldn't I look like a magician in this? Hold on... What are you two doing here? Where is Alfred? I knew it! I know what you're doing, Eman. How dare you, Eman... I leave you alone. Have you been a boatman here long? Not that long. I used to study in the city. How about you Sir, do you come here often? It's my 3rd time now. I always take Eman's boat. Good thing, Eman's not available today... otherwise, we couldn't have met. This is going to be a great day. According to Taliyah... you give good service. We all grew up here... we're all the same. I said good service. Would you want Sir? Can you handle it? My father's a German, which makes that German too. It is German indeed! Is your mother German too? She was a local tourist guide... She got pregnant by a German tourist... who eventually left us for another local woman. Do you have German siblings? Yes, he's a boatman too... but not as German as me. Sir... 50.00 if you just wanna hold it... 200.00 if you suck it, 300.00 if you want good service. Ok, that's cheap... Here's 500 pesos. Take me back to the pier. Let's go to my hotel. That's Tado, he's not a real hustler... He just knows how to deal with clients. He likes playing naive... When the client buys it, he grabs the opportunity In his set price and terms... Why are you here? I thought you went to the hanging bridge? Why are the windows shut? Why are the candles lit? Did you pray? Cecilia fears her father more than God whenever she serves him. Fears that come from strange past. Past, only the two of them knows... But this is the only person I know... Why Cecilia chose not to speak again... Have you cooked for lunch? Have you had lunch? Serve me lunch, please. Hey, why are you so quiet? Let's join Marimar over there, seems like fun out there. You go ahead. I'm waiting for a passenger back to pier. Let's go! There are more passengers there. Who knows you got booked there. Will you quit it Eman. Book yourself, I'm not gay. You fool! Are you saying I'm gay? So are Nato and Tado... Don't waste your time paddling... You'd die a boatman if you do. Who cares? Father and I get by anyway. There you go with your father again... Quit it bro, it's not helping you. Check out Nato, seems like he's got booking. Come on, join me, follow him... I'll show you how simple it is to make more money... I assure you, it won't make you less of a man. Let's go! Cecilia, I'll go ahead to the pier. You follow after cleaning up. Will you hand me my paddle? Hey child, did you hear me? Are you feeling alright? You seem fine. Never mind. Just take a rest. You go change but don't shower. Menstruation is sacred to Cecilia. It's giving birth to a part of her. Like an unborn child that needs proper burial. According to my fellow boatmen most women feel horny before menstruation. If this is true... Cecilia gets her period more than once a month. Is it also true that women who don't touch themselves stay virgin? - Can we switch some of the lights off? - Ok. Why do you seem so afraid? Come closer. - I fell a bit of ashamed. - Why? Are you new to this? It's my first time in a hotel. We usually do it by rocks near the river. So you prefer to do it outside... Where other people can see you... No Sir, it's quite private. Alright... Alright... Try not to be ashamed. It might affect your performance... And I'm sure its more private here. Can you lift your arms for me please? Come closer, please. - Why should I do that? - It's just my fetish... Fetish... What does it mean? I like seeing smooth men's armpits... Lift your arms up, please... You're funny... The other one too, please... This is Nato... He likes giving in to all his clients' requests... How does he convince himself to do this? Look at that... See how simple it is? You can do that too... maybe even better. Does Nato truly enjoy this? If he does... Does it mean he's gay too? Hey! Why aren't you watching? Let's go man... I couldn't take it. We might get caught watching. This is how Nato and Eman work. They work their clients well to a quick release. Did you like it, Sir? Tonight is the night of the only goddess of Tatalon. Honey... You get up now, please, honey. You promised me to join me to my Beauty pageant, right? Hey. Get up now, please. Just got an SMS from the organizers. They're about to start anytime soon. Hey, Junior! My God! Why is it hard to wake you up? Hey... You get up now, Honey... You promised to accompany me. Oh my... I know how to make you get up... Honey... Remember the thing you've been asking me to get for you? Well... Here it is... My gift to you... Look at it. Come on... you get up now please... - What is this? - You like it, don't you? - Of course I do. - Good... but where's my kiss? - When did you buy this? - Just this afternoon. Hmm... feels good. C'mon, help me out now... I don't wanna be late... Help me pack up. Hey, can you get my other things over there. Alright, you pack this up. Honey, please... You'll have time for that later. Here's the box. You do that later... We gotta get there on time. Ok, you switch off the lights. Will you carry this for me please? Hey! Oh my gosh, you can't even put your shirt on, you crazy. Did you like my gift? If I win later, what else do you want? - Whatever... What about those rubber shoes? - Alright, you gotta help me win this pageant It really puzzles me why some men would want to be woman. It's even more confusing... Why there are straight men that fall for women looking men... knowing they can never be real women. As for Junior one's gender is not important. Man... woman... gay... straight... to him, these are more labels. What matters to him is that he's happy... They're happy... What's important is that they give each other satisfaction. That's his opinion... Ok, the moment has come. To award Miss Calauag 2008... Please welcome Ms. Jelanie Davao-Chan Let's give her a round of applause! And the winner is... None other than... contestant no... Number 12. Our Miss Calauag 2008. - Don't feel bad Taliyah, you are our winner! - Really? Yes... and I was surprised by the decision. You could have at least checked my score... with all that candidates I can't! - That's all right. You're still the most beautiful to us. - Right! You look even lovelier with your 1st lady hairdo. What? Please don't patronize me. Hey, guys... Eman and I will have to go ahead. We gotta go somewhere else. Alright, thank you guys for the support. We'll take Alfred with us too. - Ok. What's the plan now? - I wanna eat. You wanna eat? But we want something else. We wanna celebrate with you. - But how? I don't have money. - We'll each contribute. - Alright, here's my 50 pesos share. - You collect all contributions. - Taliyah, may I have cash advance? - The pageant hasn't paid me yet. Ok... I'll just provide the ice. Just make sure it will be fun! Make sure everyone will get drunk. Don't worry it'll happen... Ok, let's go. - Hey Bunso, have you given your share yet? - Sorry bro, got no money. - I don't believe you. - Alright, here's 100 pesos. That's my man. Hey... Tado, I just remembered... - Where's my commission? - What commission are you talking about? My guest this afternoon didn't come from you. You get your commission from Taliyah. She took the entire boat and Eman's fee by herself. What are you talking about? I got no money... I lost the competition... don't you get it? - Honey, please talk to these people. - That guy is hopeless, Taliyah. Let's just wait for Nato, he'll give me commission for sure. - Because he's the only one you're booking. - Ah, whatever. Is this ok for my wedding? It just needs a bit of pressing... and you're ready for funeral. Jocelyn and my future mother in law advised me to get simple one. It's mine and it doesn't look as bad on me. I got a better one inside, come with me. Correct, try it on. I'm coming. Your Nato has arrived, Marimar! - Oh shit, you guys are drinking again? - Yes! Just to relax. Relax? Yes, and then it makes you horny. You don't have to be sarcastic, Nato. If you don't want to drink just share 50 pesos. Ok... ok... here's 50 pesos... How is this better than the other one? That's the trend now... Show your cleavage. - It's too small for you... - I know... - You turn around... Then lift your arms. You look like a magician. What's happening here? Why do you look like you're joining an orchestra? He's borrowing a suit for his wedding. Marimar gave him this instead... How much this barong cost now? The one near the drugstore costs less than 1.000 pesos. - Alright, Tarugo, I got 400 here. Take it. - Wow! How generous! Seems you made a lot today, Alfred. Did you accept gay bookings? I wasn't informed about that. I doubt it... He's got a big tool that couldn't get up. I earned it from my American passenger this afternoon. Do you buy this guy's story? I don't care where the money comes from. You just take care of that barong you're buying. I may use it too. Why, Alfred are you and Cecilia getting married? Of course not! They have no plans yet. Oh, wait, Alfred... I got your paddle here Here's your paddle, your highness. - Ok, guys, it's late, I gotta go. - It's alcohol time everyone! Why are you still up? We had a little chat at the souvenir shop. All the boatmen were there. They were making fun of Tarugo's wedding outfit. I envy him and his Fiance! Why envy them? Yes, I salute him, but most of them... they marry without know how they'd support a family. How about us? When are we getting married? It's getting late. You sleep now. I will too. I got an early day tomorrow. Don't worry, we'll get to that. I didn't know what to say... She's pushing it. I don't wanna think about it yet. - Tonight is fun. - Thanks, it doesn't matter that I lost... You didn't lose Taliyah, they fixed the scores. Even when you lost, you're still winner. What are you doing there, Marimar? Honey you close the store now. We'll open tomorrow morning. What's wrong with me? Why can't I be like Eman and Nato? Why is it so difficult to ejaculate? Marimar, help me out here. I'll take care of that. - Come here quick, Taliyah! - Ok, boys, hold on. Don't sleep there Bunso, drink up. Nato, please take Buso home. I don't wanna get in trouble with his dad. He's not drunk yet. - You can't walk, Eman, I'll walk you home. - Marimar, you walk Nato first. - Leave Eman alone. - He's drunk and he needs me. Boys, don't tell his father he came from here. - Hold on! - What's up? I just walked Eman home. Yeah, right. I salute Marimar and Taliyah. Tourists come here and pay for sex. Marimar and Taliyah just need to get them drink. Don't lie to me, Taliyah... You're done with him? Of course not. I haven't made a move. - Why does he smell like saliva? - It wasn't me. Maybe you did... Are you okay? Marimar, please tell Junior I walked Tado home. - Where's Taliyah? - She went out to buy something. - How about the rest? - They're all gone. You just sleep here. - I'll make you chicken inasal for breakfast. - Where's the other boatman? They all went boating in the fields. You go to sleep now. You're just wasting water, bathing. No one's gonna smell you anyway. Why not take advantage of your freshness? Why not ask Taliyah for help? You find a gay tourist. You can bath again afterwards. Will you stop it father? I won't sleep with the same sex, whatever you say! I am in love with Cecilia. I got good plans for us. Just this once, son. I just need money now. My cocks are all conditioned for a fight. There's a big derby tomorrow. I promise to bring home the money and pay you back. You'd surely forget what you did. Don't waste your youth for that girl. She's just another mouth to feed. You prioritize your own needs. If I were just a little bit younger... I'd ask Taliyah for a booking. If not for your mother, I would have been well off by now. Cecilia is my source of strength, Father. She's part of my plans and dreams. What you want may also happen. But not just yet. Why are you still up, Cecilia? Do you feel bad because of your period? Tomorrow it'll be better. You go to bed now. Don't complain to me... You complain to Taliyah! What complain are you talking about? - What's it about, Eman? - Why did you have me wake this up early? Sir Dexter texted me early this morning. The one from TV. He's gonna make you a star. Will you stop it, Martin! Do you remember the motorbike he brought here last time? The one that you like? He'll offer it to you for less. For less? Why not just give it to for free? You tell him that later. Leave that, Martin. You help me out here. Hurry up, Sir Dexter is on his way. Alright... alright. Excuse me. Would you know where Taliyah is? Oh yes, just right by the souvenir shop. Can you please take me there? - Alright, Sir. - C'mon, ride with me. - Sit behind me. - It's just a few steps away. C'mon... Welcome, Sir Dexter... Why are you here so early? Did you come all the way from Manila? No, I just came from Laguna. Oh, sit down, Sir Dex... Weren't you here just last week? Oh yeah... It wasn't you. Thank you Alfred for your assistance. You stay for awhile for coffee. Marimar, you make them coffee... Wait awhile, Sir Dexter... Here's your coffee, Sir Dexter, here's yours Alfred... You've got a nice bike, Sir Dexter, why are you selling it? I got a new car... Biking in Manila has become a bit dangerous. You really are big time... If I were you, I'd buy 5 more of these... Violet... pink... polka dots... I'll even put ribbon. Isn't that good idea? I just remembered the last time I was here... Eman loved this bike so much... He might wanna buy it even for installment basis... Where do I get that kind of money, Sir Dexter? Are you stupid? He said installment basis... You can pay when able... You're our best seller here, you can pay for it... You think about it, Eman... - Taliyah... Is this guy a boatman too? - Oh, yes. Can he take me to the hanging bridge? Ah... You know Sir Dexter... Alfred is... I can take you myself, Sir Dexter... You join us, man... just take us there... I'll take care of him by the rocks... I'll just take you there? Nothing else? So... Are you settled? Ok, you take him now. - Don't forget the payment, Sir Dexter... - Take care of my bike. Yes, we will... Martin will stay here anyway. Sir Dex... Don't forget... I know, I know... later. - Don't forget my extra... - Shut up! I'm asking for my commission... You watch over that bike... Hold on, Eman... I'll get my boat... Never mind Alfred, let's just use mine... Watch your step, Sir Dexter... I knew Eman's up to something... He's a real smooth talker... He's got plans... The moment Sir Dexter buys his tricks... He knows he's got him. Though a bit hesitant... I'll just go by the flow... Eman, obviously an expert in this. To him... This is just work... He knows he's got to act as if he's enjoying it. Eman's right... it's not so difficult. It's a bit uneasy... It's tickling... It feels so good... I can do this... I can do this... Good thing Sir Dexter came first... Though I didn't ejaculate this time... I can say I'm a boatman like Eman and Nato... My paddle finally made money. Even when I keep this a secret to Cecilia... I know she can feel it. Yet I don't feel her anger... It's almost dinnertime. Yet I'm just about to have lunch. I feel starving, but fear inside me overpowers it. There's something weird about Cecilia's smile. Her footsteps sound strange. So does the sound of plates on the table. I don't know why... I feel it's my last meal. It feels like an ending of something... You know the sound of deafening silence? It's like listening to nothing... I could say it's fear... but it's not... They say fear is a feeling anticipating the unknown. I just want this ritual to end now so I know what's next... What's next anyway? I'll just play that Cecilia finds courage to say what she wants. Eman is clueless I was in Cecilia's mind as they kiss... But when you're horny you don't care anymore. Jesus... Maria... Joseph... Get out of here! Get out of here! Why my child? How can you let the devil overpower you. Come and ask for god's forgiveness... You gotta ask for forgiveness... God is forgiving... He will forgive you... You ask for his forgiveness... Ask for his mercy... Come with me to the bathroom... You clean up, child... I will clean your mouth... You put only food only in your mouth... You wash up... I gotta clean you up... I took good care of you... You are mine... Only mine! Cecilia and Eman... They both are my friends... Eman loves Cecilia... I know Cecilia loves me... I love Cecilia... I love Eman too... How can that be? 18 years of self-control... 18 years of patiently waiting for this moment... At last... I have reached the end... I am not like my father... I didn't fool anyone... I didn't cause anyone misery... I know my Mother will understand me... I don't know... All I know is that... I am free... It doesn't matter who you're doing it with... What matters more... is how it feels while you're doing it. Whatever people think of this... It doesn't matter to me...
