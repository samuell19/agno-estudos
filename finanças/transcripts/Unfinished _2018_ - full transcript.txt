The end of the Cold War in 1986, Berlin, the city of division was the home of intelligence agents from all over the world. North Korean operatives focused on the South Korean community of West Berlin. There was active engagement across the border between East and West Germany. Inspired by true events I was given orders to become a spy. I was told to bring two Korean-Germans to North Korea. I left Pyongyang. I was supposed to arrive in West Germany via Copenhagen Airport. Why did you go to North Korea? 1986 West Germany Federal Intelligence Office Water, please. What did you say? I asked you why you went to North Korea. That was a mistake. It was a mistake... Two days ago Excuse me, please fasten your seat belt. We will be arriving shortly. The estimated time of arrival at Copenhagen International Airport is 15:40. 15 to 30 minutes from now. The current temperature in Copenhagen is 9Â°C. Thank you. Gyu-won? Gyu-won? Gyu-won. OK, let's go... to your seat. Excuse me, Hae-won. OK. There. We're nearly there so can you sit still for a bit, Gyu-won? Maybe you can read her some stories. OK. Due to unexpected turbulence please fasten your seat belt... Comrade. Are you OK? I'm fine. We're landing soon. Get back to your seat. Copenhagen Airport, Denmark Thank you. - Thank you. - You're welcome. Next. Let's go. Hello. Passport. Hello? Please send airport security guards to B8 counter. Now. - No! Come here! - Sir... You'll have to come with us right now. Gyu-won, come here! - Gyu-won! - Sir. - Come with us... - I need my daughter. - Follow us now! - Gyu-won, come here. Gyu-won! Gyu-won, come here! Gyu-won... Gyu-won... Hey... Don't go! - Gyu-won. - No! - Hey... - Gyu-won... Gyu-won, come here! Come to Daddy! - Dear... - Come here! Dear! No... Dear. Gyu-won! UNFINISHED West Germany Federal Intelligence Office He's here. - How are you? - Welcome. - That's the guy? - Yeah, that's him. Oh Young-min. - What do you think? - Well. It's hard to tell. He said that he's a North Korean spy? Yeah, we're looking into it. But he's just an ordinary economist. He came to West Germany in 1970 to study and got married. Anything unusual? He was in the Democratic Citizen's Movement. It's a democratic movement within Germany protesting the Korean Yushin regime. As a result, he was denied entry to Korea and sought asylum in West Germany seven years ago. Three years ago, he acquired a doctorate in Marxist economics at the University of Bremen. He vanished into thin air a year ago. Him and his family. Until two days ago when he showed up at the Copenhagen Airport. Why did he defect to North Korea? The North Koreans lied to him. They promised to hire him as their economist. But they trained him to become a spy instead. A covert spy mission. Orders... from the Room 35? Yes. From Chief Choi Gi-chul. Room 35 of United Front Department. He's a political heavyweight. So Oh Young-min is a socialist. An anti-government activist. He's an asylum seeker on top of that. All the facts fit perfectly. It must've been easy for North Korea to turn him around. This case... we'll hand it over to the CIA. And... - We'll let him go for now. - Excuse me? Will that be a problem for West Germany? Well... it's not likely but I think we should look into the possibility of him being a double agent. Him? A double agent? He doesn't look capable of it. Set him free. Hae-won... Sign these documents and you're free to go. East Berlin? A woman and a girl? Where? Are you sure? OK. One of our agents will escort you downtown. What should we do? Follow him. Mr Economics is trying to find his family. I want a report on everyone he meets and all the places he goes. What the hell. - I need your help. - My help? Why not just call when you're six feet under? I'm not going to make any excuses. But... I have to get Gyu-won and Eun-sook back. I deliver food supplies now. What about the consulate? I quit. West Berlin, two years ago The medicine you asked for. Chronic hepatitis is dangerous. You should pay special attention to your wife. OK. For the medicine. No, it's OK... Half the Koreans in this town put their medical bill on the tab. I'm still making money just fine, Dr Oh. You'll pay me back when you become a professor, right? Of course! Just kidding. It's not easy being a doctorate student. I'm proud of you. Maybe one day I'll need a favour from you. Don't despair because life is hard here. You can put your research to use anywhere in the world. - Hello? - Mu-hyuk. What now? Are you drunk again? - Maybe I should go to North Korea. - Sure. Swing by the moon while you're at it. I heard that North Korea thinks highly of my research. It's a good fit with their economic policy. Hey, I heard Mr Huh is in Pyongyang. With a teaching job, a house and a Benz. He's living it up. Don't you think it would be better for Hae-won and Gyu-won to live there? Who cares about getting a doctorate? Nobody cares about my research here. What are you talking about? Just try and make it here. In Germany. Hey, Mu-hyuk. My research can advance North Korea's economy. Doesn't that sound awesome? Your wife is going to be thrilled to hear that. Stop entertaining these crazy thoughts. Have some patience. You'll be a professor soon enough. Go back to bed. We're closed. So you went to North Korea? You made that decision without even telling me first? Selfish schmuck... oh, forget it. I... I need to find Gyu-won and Eun-sook fast. They should still be in Germany. Let me stay here for a while. Hae-won won't talk to me anymore. She doesn't even look at me. It's like I don't know her anymore. Lichtenberg Lichtenberg, East Berlin I can't wait any longer. I'm going to report it to Chief Choi of United Front Department. Baek Gyeong-soo... Do you think you're the only one who'd take the fall for this? How many times have I told you? That's why I'm saying we should report it before things gets worse. I'm ready to be punished by the Party. This is not just about you! Because of you, all your comrades here might get summoned home. Are you saying you don't give a crap? Comrade Kim. You've been away from the Republic for too long. I think you've forgotten what happens when you try to withhold information from the Party. It's best to report it as soon as possible. University of Bremen, West Berlin (German) Let go of me. What's wrong with you? Are you crazy? We're in school! Let me go and we'll talk. I don't know what you've heard but I didn't do it. How would I know? What did you say to me before? Didn't you say my research will be put into use in North Korea? That I was going to be a hero? Are you saying I'm a North Korean spy? I'm a professor, Young-min. Why would I... I'm nothing like the rest of them. - Don't you trust me? - I don't care. What's their address? I can't tell you what I don't know. Young-min, please don't do this! Tell me! Chung-geun... Have you talked to him? Hae-won... Oh Hae-won, look at me. Look at Daddy! I'm going to do everything I can to find your mummy and Gyu-won. Are you going to just sit there? Don't you miss Mummy and Gyu-won? If you miss them you have to help me, Hae-won. Young... Young-min... When did you come back? Where did I go? I thought... you'd gone back to South Korea! I've been banned from South Korea for over a decade now. Right. Bloody moron. No... stay away from me! I ate a while ago. Hae-won, do you want some more? Hey, that hurts. That's all? Is there anyone else? There should be... but this is all I know. I'm just... Their minion. You betrayed your friend because they promised you free stuff. That's a little too harsh. How do you sleep at night? I have to make ends meet somehow! You went to North Korea for the same reason! You were happy to go. You're not that different from me! Hey, give Hae-won more food! OK. Hi. You're all grown up. - Here. - My eldest, Il-yang. Where was it again? Lichtenberg? If Eun-sook is still in East Berlin, Officer Kim probably has her. He's in charge of the North Korean spies in Berlin. They're based in Lichtenberg. Think you can go there? Hey! I have to, one way or another. Who is it? - I'm looking for someone who... - Sorry. I don't know. Next time. Please spare me a moment of your time. No... I'm busy. It'll only be a minute. No, next time maybe. My daughter is coming with me. How long will it take? To Lichtenberg? Take this. And this. You'll need it to cross to East Berlin. Put it away! I've done all I can. OK? Hae-won! Hae-won. What's wrong? What's wrong? It's OK... It's OK... There was a rock... a really big one... It was rolling towards us, Daddy. We couldn't get away from it. And the people behind it were after us too. I'm scared! - Daddy... - It's OK. It's OK... no one's coming after us. Daddy's here for you. It's OK. Daddy, I'm scared. - Don't worry, OK? - I'm scared. I won't make any excuses, sir. I have his wife and daughter. The Federal Intelligence Service is watching him, so I should lay low. Oh Young-min wants his family back. He will come to us. Don't go, Daddy. And never let go of my hand. Did Mummy let go of your hand at the airport, Hae-won? We'll find Mummy and ask her about it. Why she let go of your hand. OK? West Berlin Border Control Open your trunk. ID, please. Thank you. He just passed the checkpoint going to East Berlin. Do you have the number that I gave you? Look at me. You must not follow me into the building. Can you promise me that? Eun-sook? Eun-sook? Gyu-won? Oh Young-min. Are you here for your family? Where are they? Young-min... Eun-sook! - Answer me! - Daddy! Daddy... Hae-won, run! Hae-won. Run! Hae-won! Are you here for your daddy? No... - Hae-won, run! - You rat! Hae-won! - Daddy! - Dear! - Daddy! - Young-min! - Hae-won! - Stop it! Please stop... Let me go! Hae-won! - Daddy! - Young-min! Young-min... Young-min! Young-min! You friggin' rat! Young-min. Are you OK, Young-min? Wake up, Young-min! - Young-min! - Daddy... Hae-won. Turn the lights on! Where are those rats? Let's go. Hurry. Get in. Stop right there, you rats! Hell! Those friggin' rats! Pyongyang Liaison Office, Chilbosan What's going on with Oh Young-min? Why hasn't there been an update? You should report back when the Party sends you a spy. Don't ask me. Haven't you heard from Comrade Baek? Comrade Baek is nowhere to be found. Beside, you're the one in charge, Comrade Kim. I need my report. Why? Does it hurt your pride to report to me? The Oh family is taking a rest in the safe house. Their older girl is down with a very bad cold. Anyway, we were given one month for this mission, weren't we? Oh Young-min just needs to accomplish his mission by then, right? Of course. And I trust you, Comrade Kim. You better not mess this up. Right, make sure you send me the operational funds. How well I do my job hinges on how much money I get. I'm hanging up. How should I get rid of this wily old fox? Call Lee Chung-geun. Oh Young-min isn't going to be enough. So, there was a reason why you were told to watch this guy. Wait a minute. Now, this guy is on the wrong side. He's an NIS agent in South Korea. Choi Mu-hyuk. NIS? NIS safe house, West Berlin What were you thinking killing a man in there? A South Korean NIS agent killing an employee of the North Korean embassy in East Berlin. Do you want to start a war? Still, you made a good call following Oh Young-min last night. If he had been taken back to the North our hard work would've gone to waste. What do you mean? You saw it last night. How he was stirring things up. You have a very interesting friend. He's at your house right now? Keep an eye on him for now. And stay alert. Those commies in Berlin are probably crapping their pants right now. Are you suggesting we use Oh Young-min? Why not? He has lost his family. We should... Save his family. Save his family... yes. Of course. Do you have any ideas how to do it? You want to barge into enemy territory again like you did last night? Are you Rambo? We'll wait for an opportune moment to get Oh Young-min's family out. All that chumming up to him has paid off. Don't miss this chance. When did you first meet Oh Young-min? Oh yes, back then! He was your first target. Bang! So, deliver that schmuck to South Korea. If you could get the other spies too that'd be great. Don't worry too much. Just do what's best for yourself. Are you OK? You can't go out there looking like that. Let's go. All right... I'll explain everything. And then you can go if you want to. I can't trust you. I can't stay here. Your enemies are out there. Where are you going to go? Who are you? Why were you there last night? I had to be. What are you? I'm with National Intelligence Service. How long have you been watching me? Since the Democratic Citizen's Movement. What? You scumbag! Don't you get it? This is Berlin. Everyone is a spy. You were in North Korea and now you're back. Everyone you know is subject to investigation. And then you went over to East Berlin using a fake ID. Are you out of your mind? Is it a crime to want to find my family? Are Eun-sook and Gyu-won spies now? So, what do you want from me? One thing is for sure. No one is going to help you. So you expect me to sit back and do nothing? What if... Eun-sook and Gyu-won end up back in the North? You want me to watch them return to hell? No way. I'll do anything to get them back. Young-min. I know you don't trust me but stay here for now. It's safer here. Aren't you going to bed, dear? Yes, soon. What's wrong? Did I wake you up? Are you smoking? I told you to close the door when you smoke. We have kids here. Sorry. Why did you bring your son here? My wife can't handle all the kids by herself. So why did you want to see me? Here. Take this. Take it, man! Officer Kim wants to see you. Call that number tomorrow. He said you should come alone if you want your family back alive. I asked around for a bit. The Party doesn't seem to know that you did a runner. I think Officer Kim didn't report it. I don't know what he's up to but you should be careful. Dr Oh, it's been a while. How have you been? Get to the point. Oh, your wife and kid? You sound pretty desperate. How are you going to get my wife and daughter back to me? You don't sound like the Dr Oh I used to know. Where are they? Let's talk in person! Calm down. I want to meet with you but there are too many eyes out there. Didn't I tell you to come alone? Why did you bring everyone? Do you want your family back or not? So many of them. Where are you? Tell me! Don't worry about me. I'm always watching you no matter where you are. But I'm not the only one watching you. Check out the cafÃ© on the left side of the square. The man who's reading a newspaper. Doesn't he seem a bit off? Not just him. The fountain on the other side. The man taking photos. He's spying on you too. They are all CIA agents. You see the hotel on the right-hand side of the square? The room on the third floor with the curtains slightly parted. Third one from the left. They are NIS agent from South Korea. I'm sure Choi Mu-hyuk is there right now. Next to the street light there's Sam who let you go free. The vice-president of CIA German Division is here. Looks like everybody is here. Everyone has their eyes and ears on you. And none of them gives a crap about your family. Didn't you find it odd that they let you go so easily? They let you off so easily only because they want to see if you'll be of any use. You need a bait if you want to fish. Gosh, there are so many paths around you but nowhere for you to go, Comrade Oh. Daddy. Daddy. Daddy. Daddy, are you OK? I'm OK, Hae-won. I'm OK, Hae-won. I promise you... I'll find Mummy and Gyu-won. Really? So, when you find Mummy and Gyu-won where are we going to live? - Where? - Yeah. Listen carefully. Don't mess around and do exactly as I say. Get me Professor Lee Mun-ho of Humboldt University of Berlin. That should be easy since you're friends. Please come in. If you accomplish the mission, I'll put in a good word to the Party with regards to your family. Are your kids adjusting well to the new place? I'm worried about my own kids. Jeong-yoon wants to pursue music. So I was thinking it might be better if we stay here. There's nothing to worry about. The Party will send her overseas to study music. They can do that for you, no problem. This will be a good chance for them to learn about their country. That makes sense. Professor Lee. You should focus on your research. Initially, I had many concerns too... but these days... how should I say it? These days, it's worrying how little I have to worry about. I heard that North Korea thinks highly of my research. It's a good fit with their chemical technology policies. You know, I'm getting older every day. It's not easy settling down in a foreign country. So, I am... seriously... considering moving to North Korea. It'll be more productive than wasting your talent here. Like you said... we're getting older. Yes. Assimilating into a completely new country isn't... It's not going to be easy. That's why you shouldn't move there, moron. Dr Oh, are you all right? It's nothing. I should go now. Professor Lee. I'd suggest you take your time to think it over. No. I should seize the opportunity. I'll buy you a drink when I'm in the North. Mr Oh. You're leaving? Hi, Jeong-yoon. It's been a while. How are Hae-won and Gyu-won? How are they? I miss Hae-won. I'm a bit busy today. Sorry. Hae-won! Oh Hae-won! I've been given an order to be a spy in West Germany. What? And who will you be luring over? Who are you going to bring here? You're going to destroy someone else's life to save our own? How are you going to look our daughters in the eye? Where is your conscience? Look at me! Is this what you mean when you talked about rationality and intellect? I'm going to take care of this! So, stop! Have you ever thought about what we really want? Are you tired, Hae-won? Want a piggyback ride? It's OK. I'm no longer a kid. Of course you are. Come on, hop on. Hop on, please. One, two... and off we go. Daddy. Yeah? You smell. That's because I was running around looking for you. Why? Do you want to get off? No, I mean I like it. The smell of my daddy. I did what you asked. He is almost convinced. You can meet up with him and wrap it up. Well done, Comrade Oh. I'm sure it wasn't easy to persuade him. You're finally doing your part. Now it's my turn. I want to see my family. Not yet. Do I seem like a fool to you? Don't you forget that I am the key to your family. Jang Do-jin. Where does Choi Mu-hyuk live again? Around Lenin Street. We can use with some insurance. Follow him. Have we met before? Do you have a light? Yeah. Thank you. Do you have family? - Yes, of course. - That's nice. You see them much? Looks like the weather's going to get better. Thank you for the light. So, should we follow him? Get better soon... Daddy? - Be careful. - Don't worry. Committee for the Peaceful Reunification. Director Kim Young-ho. Kim Young-ho. Kim Young-ho. 43 Kaiser Bilhelm Street. Hae-won? We've gone to church. To be honest, I hated Daddy. I blamed him for Mummy and Gyu-won being separated from us. Daddy never cared about us. He decides where we should live without asking what we want. But now, I just feel sorry for him. He seems very tired. I'm upset because there's nothing I can do to help him. Please help us. Help Daddy find Mummy and Gyu-won. You'll answer my prayer, won't you? - Uncle Mu-hyuk... - Stay still. - Uncle... - Be quiet. Uncle! Uncle Mu-hyuk! Hey... hey! - Daddy! - Shut her up! - Crap. - Daddy... - Hae-won! - Daddy! Stay still! Hae-won! Hae-won! What are you doing? You listen up. Mr NIS. Is this fun to you? Playing war games with my family as pawn? Go tell them this. From now on, whoever gets in my way whether they're from the South or North is going to get hurt. When are you going to step in? His kid got kidnapped right before our eyes. We should do something! I told you we should help him first before getting him to turn himself in. We're almost there. He's completely cornered. There's only one place left for him to go. A bit longer. Let's wait just a bit longer. Mr Rambo. You're so impatient. Mu-suk. - Was this... - Mu-hyuk! Was this a part of your plan all along? Don't you have family? Shouldn't we protect a fellow South Korean? Isn't that your job? That's a good point. A fellow South Korean? Is Oh Young-min a citizen of South Korea now? He's a refugee. He's a West German. What? You feel bad for your friend? You shouldn't. My job here is to get these commies to turn themselves in. That's my job and how I protect my country. Got it? Starting now, you're off this case. Bloody hell! Mu-hyuk, please stop! Let go. Go ahead, eat your friggin' hotdog and protect nobody but your own family! I'll protect Young-min's family myself! Let go of me! If Oh Young-min wants to come home he has to pay the price. And you'll come back to me on your knees! 43 Kaiser Bilhelm... See you tomorrow. Germany isn't the only place for people like us. Don't you think so, Dr Oh? There are opportunities everywhere for you. What brings you here, Dr Oh? You already know why I'm here. The biggest mistake I've made is that I trust people too easily. Especially you. How would your life turn out if you hadn't made that choice? At least I wouldn't be separated from my family. You're the one who grabbed the chance and then messed it up. Repent while you can, Dr Oh. I will help you. I don't need you to. Then, why are you here? Because you're the last card I have up my sleeve. Director of Committee for the Peaceful Reunification. Kim Young-ho. You. What are you talking about? Step outside quietly. I might shoot if you do something dumb. What in the world are you doing? You're making a very big mistake! Oh Young-min! How dare you do this to me? I will take responsibility for my choices. Even though I was fooled by you. Fooled by me? You lied to fellow Koreans who trusted you. And then you lied to yourself and found excuses for all the dirty deeds you've done. All I've done is follow my beliefs. Enough of your nonsense, get up! You don't want to test me. Sir? You've got a call from the hospital. - Drop it. - Don't move! Are you OK, sir? Get up. Have you seen the photos? It seems like the Party doesn't know I've gone rogue. That number is Chief Choi's direct fax number. Do I need to elaborate any further? You friggin' maggot! If you do anything to hurt my kids I'll fax that photo of Baek Gyeong-soo to Chief Choi. Do it! As soon as you do that I'm going to slit their throats. You shouldn't get so worked up because I'm just getting started. Dr Kang Moon-hwan is in my hands. Oh, right. I guess you probably know him by his other name. Kim Young-ho. I hear he's ranked 40th in the Party. Wouldn't the NIS agents just have a field day with him? If he's sent to South Korea it's going to be the biggest arrest of a North Korean spy to date. What do you want? I'll give you Kang Moon-hwan in exchange for my family. 11.00 pm tonight at Friedrich Station gate #4. Prove to me that my wife is alive. This is non-negotiable. It's an order. Dr Oh! Hey, you piece of crap! Oh Young-min has made his move. He kidnapped Kang Moon-hwan. What are they thinking? They will most likely exchange Kang Moon-hwan with Oh Young-min's family. Checkmate. Are you OK? Don't cry. I kept my word. Let's get this over with, shall we? I told you, I'm the one giving orders now. Listen up. The exchange cannot take place indoors. No enclosed spaces. It has to be somewhere in the open. But there can't be people around. Or any buildings. Also, it must be near the border between East and West Germany. We will finish this business there. Very clear instructions. In that case... I'll see you in the red zone. This document should be adequate payment for your help. Take this and go back to South Korea. I know you're sick of this place too. And... I've never doubted you, my friend. Even though you're an NIS agent. Thank you for everything, Mu-hyuk. Just listen. Does Boss know Young-min's plan? Yes. So, what's the plan? Oh Young-min won't make it to the exchange. We're going to waylay him at Oberbaum Checkpoint. Where is Sam? Please! Get out... get out! Please... Hey... Oh Young-min and Kang will be there! I know you want Kang! Let him go. NIS is trying to steal Kang Moon-hwan from Oh Young-min! They will send Kang to South Korea. Young-min won't be able to get his family back. You have to stop it! You have to. Please. Please. Please... He's here. Let's go. Mr Oh Young-min, please open the door. Mr Oh Young-min, step outside. Please open the door. Please step out. We don't have time for this. Please step outside. Mr Oh Young-min, doing this won't... - Let's talk. - Hey... What's this? What's going on? What? I think they're letting him pass. What? What are you waiting for? Follow him! Stop. Stop. Back up. - Let me through. - Who are you? Step back! Let me through! - Stay put. - I said, let me through! How did it go? - Did Young-min get through? - Yes. Where is he? There he is. - He came alone. - What is he doing? What? Why did he park so far away? Where are my wife and kids? Bring them out here. - Bring them. - Do it. Daddy! Daddy! Daddy! Daddy! Daddy! Listen up. Send my wife and kids over. I send them out of here. I'll be back in 10 minutes with Kang Moon-hwan. Oh... that twerp. He wants to save his family even if it means risking his own life. Don't you think that's a little unfair? Let's meet in the middle! Move. - Take Kang Moon-hwan. - Yes, sir. And then... shoot them all. - Daddy! - Go! - No...! - Daddy! Daddy! Aren't those embassy cars? I think you're right. It's all right. This is not our motherland. Hey! Am I late to the party? Comrade Kim. Look at what you've done. You know what? I don't understand, Comrade Kim. I thought you were one of the top elites. How did you manage to mess up this bad? I'd like to make a phone call to Pyongyang, North Korea. What's the code? - Code, please. - Red moon. Comrade Oh. Do you know what you're doing right now? Kim Gil-joong has my family. And I have Kim Young-ho. What do you want? My family. Let us go so we can live in this country. Let me talk to Kim Young-ho. Comrade Choi. Ditch Kim Gil-joong. And save me. He has always been a thorn in your side. I'll make sure you get his job and his men. - Mummy! - Freeze! Bring him over. Bring him over. Come with me. I don't want to go. I don't want to go. Daddy... What? What's that? Shoot him! - Take cover, sir! - Take cover! Protect the kids! - Come here! - This way. Shoot him! You lowlife rat... Who the hell is that? Shoot! Cover me! Shoot! Stop. Stop shooting. Let me see. Why did you come here? Why? We were so close. We were so close, darn you! Did you really think they'd let you go? Nothing works out as you hope in this place. You think I don't know that? Come to South Korea with me. I'll help you find your family. What are you doing? Go get him! What are you waiting for? - Hurry! - Come on. What was that? Where was that from? Where? One North Korean agent down. Standing by. They've received a gunfire report from the East German Intelligence Agency. Armed troops are getting into their vehicles. We're going to get Kang Moon-hwan. Proceed. The Stasi is approaching. Complete everything in 20 minutes. Hell... I'll go over there, sir. I'll bring him over here. Oh Young-min, what are you doing? Come out here! You have unfinished business! Hurry up and exchange me for your family! Oh Young-min, what are you doing? Right now! It's not over yet! Keep your promise! Chief Choi... What was that? If they take Kim Young-ho... do you think we can bear the consequences? A North Korean agent shot Kang Moon-hwan. What should we do? Stop everything and stand by. Stop everything for now and stand by. Roger that. F**king city. A Stasi vehicle has passed the checkpoint. What should we do with Oh Young-min's family? Passed the checkpoint and headed to Oberbaum Bridge. Bring them out. Dr Oh. Are there any more surprises for me? Step out here if there isn't. Aren't you embarrassed to do this in front of your family? Dr Oh, look at this mess you've made. Drop the gun. Come here! Daddy... Daddy! Daddy! Daddy... - Daddy! - Dear! Daddy! You wily old fox. Hey. Are you still there? Identify yourself if you're still alive. Chief Choi... Daddy! Chief Choi! Isn't it over now? Let's go back to North Korea together! Let me live. Please let me live, comrade! Please... let my wife and kids live. Please let them live! My kids have done nothing wrong. I can die for them. Chief Choi! Dr Oh. I just had the most wonderfully horrible idea. I'll let all of you live as you requested. But not together as a family. Who knows? You might get to see them again before you die.
