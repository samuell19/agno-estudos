[MEN SPEAKING IN FOREIGN LANGUAGE] [MEN SPEAKING IN FOREIGN LANGUAGE] [BOTH GRUNTING] [ALL GRUNTING] [MEN SHOUTING] [GRUNTING] Jackson, you going to be going to Hong Kong? I love anything with full contact. Need a few more scars. I heard you get killed at that kumite. Only if you fuck up. Unh. [BOTH GRUNT] [LAUGHS] Tomorrow, we leave for the kumite. Sir? Excuse me, but Colonel Cooke would like to see you - before you leave on furlough. - What's the problem? The colonel found out you're going to Hong Kong. He wants to talk to you. Tell him I'll be right there... after I take a shower. - But I'll have to wait, sir. - OK. What's taking so long, Captain? [WATER RUNNING] Captain? Shit! - Sir! - Where's Dux? He was in the gym. He took a shower, I waited, he disappeared. What do you mean?! One minute he was there, the next, he wasn't. If anything happens in Hong Kong... Get Helmer and Rawlins on this right away! And I don't want to see your face again until Dux is beside it! [SIGHS] - How is he? - He's resting now. - He'll be so happy to see you. - It's so good to be here again. - I tell him you're here. - Thank you. BOY 1: Wow, look at the sword! BOY 2: Let's get it! Come on, Frank. What's the matter, you chicken? - No. - BOY 1: Then get in here! BOY 2: Hey, Frank, you want to hang out with us, then come on! You just going to stand there, or are you going to grab something? [DOOR OPENS] Shit! They're coming back! Let's get out of here! - Come on, Frank! - BOY 2: Forget him. Let's go! That's enough, Shingo. Go to your studies. You cannot get katana sword by stealing. It is a very special sword. - You must earn it. - I wasn't going to steal it. You didn't flinch. You have fighting spirit. - You're not going to call the cops? - Not if we make a deal. What kind of a deal? TANAKA: Your son and my son are in the same school. Frank sees my son's skill, and he desires to learn martial science, too. MR. DUX: Yes, but what do you mean by "martial science"? Frank's told me you came to America to grow vine. Yes, that's right. I work at the Verne Vineyard. I came here to grow fish in my hatchery. We both grow children. You use science to make vines grow better. Like vines, children need training. Martial science provide a way of training. Brings mind, body, spirit together. That's enough! - That's all for today. - Not yet. Why don't you quit, round-eye? Not yet. Go practice your katas. How come you coach him but not me? I brought you here to help me train my son. Don't question me! If you expect me to be his punching bag, you can forget about our deal. [BOYS SHOUTING] Yeah! Throw a punch. [CHILDREN SHOUTING] Some day, I'll fight in the kumite and make my father proud. FRANK: Shidoshi, I feel like I've lost part of my family, too. Shingo and I were close friends, brothers. And you and Mrs. Tanaka have treated me... ...like a son. What will happen now? No more training. I stop now. But you have so much to teach. TANAKA: You don't understand. In the war, I lost my first family: My son, daughter and wife. They live in Hiroshima. I left Japan because of the war. War was wrong. I came here to start over. Begin a new family, with a son, another chance to pass on the teaching. For 2,000 years, knowledge passed from father to son, father to son. When Shingo died, it stopped. Teach me. I can do it. You are not Japanese! You are not a Tanaka! You taught me, using any technique that works, never to limit myself to one style, - to keep an open mind. - Why? To honor you, Shidoshi. [FRANK GRUNTING] [BOTH GRUNTING] [FRANK GRUNTING] [GRUNTS] [FRANK GRUNTS] [INHALES DEEPLY] [EXHALES] [GRUNTS] [EXHALES] [GRUNTS] Practice until you can meditate. Nothing can distract you, so that you see and feel nothing except your own energy. [FRANK EXHALES] [SCREAMING] [SCREAMING] [GRUNTING] Are you awake, Shidoshi? Do you sleep with your eyes open? How are you feeling? [SIGHS] Like a old man. And how about you? - I am going to Hong Kong. - You're sure you want to do this? To honor you means everything to me. I have poured all my knowledge into you. When you fight, my spirit fight with you. In kumite, you will need it. JACKSON: Hey, babe. Want to go out with a real "big man"? No, huh? Too handsome for you, huh, honey? WOMAN: This your first time in Hong Kong? You two are here for the kumite, aren't you? Kumite? What is kumite? Look, guys, I know there's a secret, full-contact event being held in Hong Kong in the next few days. - Yes. Hong Kong is an exciting city. - I also happen to know a little bit about some of your competition. OK. Um... would you just tell me how you got invited? [MEN SPEAKING IN FOREIGN LANGUAGE] Thanks, guys. [LAUGHS] [ARCADE GAME BEEPS] What, think you can give me some competition? Sure, I'll try it. That's what I like to hear, a kid who isn't afraid to lose. No, no, I got it. I won't take your money. - You ready? - Yeah. [GAME PLAYING INDISTINCTLY] - You like this kind of fighting, huh? - Yeah. You want to see some real fighting, you can see me fight at the kumite. I'm here, too, for the kumite. Aren't you a little young for full contact? Aren't you a little old for video games? - You want to go at it again, huh? - Yeah. [JACKSON SIGHS] - Not bad, kid. Name's Ray Jackson. - I'm Frank Dux. - Mrs. Tanaka. - Mrs. Tanaka? Yes? HELMER: It's very important to the government of the United States that we find Frank Dux. We understand he might have visited here recently. - Mr. Tanaka is very ill. - We're sorry to hear that. - Was Frank here recently? - Frank came here to pay his respects. - When was that? - Two days ago. Did he say, or do you know if he was going to Hong Kong? - I don't know. - Of course you know. Look, we're not trying... We're very sorry to have disturbed you. Thank you very much for your time. MAN: May I help you? My name is Jackson. This is Mr. Frank Dux. Our rooms ready? Mr. Lin in room 310 wants to see you after you check in. Who the hell is Mr. Lin? I'm Lin. You Jackson? You look like a Jackson. - That would make you Frank Ducks. - No, no, no. It's Dux. Gotcha! Like "put up your dukes," right? OK, so here's the deal. This is the biggest kumite ever. We got fighters from all over. I've been assigned by the IFAA to help you and the other North American fighters find your way around. I'm going to make sure you guys give it your best and don't disqualify by fighting outside the arena. LIN: The triad, they are like the mafia, is allowing us to hold kumite here this time. Here it comes, men, the war city. Not a place for outsiders. You are in Hong Kong, but you are about to cross an invisible border into Mainland China. No joke, man. It's a rundown piece of no-man's land in the middle of a tourist paradise. Goes way back to the old lease agreement between Great Britain and China. Once you step out of the sunlight into the narrow corridors, it's time to protect your nuts, guys. [LIN SPEAKING IN FOREIGN LANGUAGE] OK, USA! OK, USA. [BABY CRYING IN DISTANCE] [WOMAN SHOUTING IN FOREIGN LANGUAGE] [MEN CHATTERING IN FOREIGN LANGUAGE] [RATS SQUEAKING] [MEN CHATTERING IN FOREIGN LANGUAGE] OK, guys, first, you can show the Black Dragon Boys your invitation. Then you got to qualify and prove to them you can step onto the runway and not get killed. - Got it? - Mm-hm. You got it? FRANK: Mm-hm. It says he represents the Tanaka clan. You don't look like Tanaka. - Shidoshi Tanaka trained me. - What's the hold-up? He says Senzo Tanaka is his shidoshi. What's the difference if Bruce Springsteen is his shidoshi? If Senzo Tanaka is his shidoshi, then show us the dim mak. - What the hell is a dim mack? - Death touch. Thanks. Vic, choose a brick. OK, Frank. What about this one? No! Bottom one. [GRUNTS] Whoa, yeah! Son of the bitch! Is that good enough, guys? We honor your invitation. No shit, you honor his invitation! That was great! Very good... but brick not hit back. RAWLINS: Here's a picture of the man that we're looking for. His name is Frank Dux. We have reason to believe Frank is here in Hong Kong. His name was on a list on a flight from San Francisco two days ago. Two days ago? Maybe he already left, went somewhere else. Asia's a very big place, you know. We were hoping you'd hold onto this for reference. We're here because Frank is going to fight in the kumite, and we're here to stop him. - The kumite? - Yes. Inspector Chen, we all know that the kumite is happening here in Hong Kong, and we all know it's going on over the next three days. Look, all we want you to do is pass this picture out to your men. They spot Dux, they give us a call. My men are already overworked. If it's too much trouble, forget it... HELMER: Inspector, we're all overworked. But we need your help. I'll see what can be done. You know where to reach us. Mm-hm. You come upstairs with me for an interview. - Like hell! Let go of me. - You want Hossein, no? - No, Hossein is an asshole. - What did you call me? You want me to spell it out for you? Leave the girl alone. He's the American shithead who makes tricks with bricks. Guess the kumite starts one day earlier this year, huh, fellas? - Let's all just calm down, OK? - She's coming with me. - No, I'm not. - If we have to fight for her, then both of us will be thrown out of the kumite. Just for her? We could arrange this another way. - Do you gamble? - What is bet? You hold this. If I can grab it before you close your hand, I get the girl. If I cannot... ...she's yours. - HOSSEIN: Very good. - You can't do this! Just relax. Take it. Jeez, Frank, I hope you know what you're doing. Ready? Go! You lose, American asshole. Looks like she's mine. Now, leave the lady alone. You understand that? [JANICE SIGHS] Why were you with Hossein? I've been trying to get a story on the kumite. I'm a reporter. He tell you anything? He told me I had nice legs. He's right about that. Why is it that no one will talk about the kumite? What is this air of mystery? I'm just trying to find out what it's all about. - Why are you fighting in it? - It's personal. You want to prove your manhood to the world? The kumite is for the fighters, not for the people who read newspapers. I've heard that it's unnecessarily brutal, like a cockfight, except it's with people. You have the wrong picture. Will you tell me about it, Frank? I want to have the right picture. OK, I'll talk to you. But one condition. What's that? You agree to have dinner with me tomorrow night. Well, actually, I was hoping Hossein would be free. [KNOCKING ON DOOR] That hurts me just looking at it. Yo, Frankie! Earth to Frankie! This is ground control. Do you copy? It's time to get ready. You better stop doing that. You might want to have kids one of these days. Victor's downstairs. Kumite express leaves in five minutes. Are you ready? I am ready. [DRUMS BEATING] You can almost smell the adrenaline in this place, can't you? Yeah. They are going to love me over here. But they really love Asians because we're good-looking. [DRUMS BEATING] [GONG RINGS] MAN: Welcome, warriors of the world. Today, you become part of a tradition that began hundreds of years ago. The kumite was first used by the Kokoruki, the Black Dragon Society, to measure the fighting skills and spirit of its members. Every five years, the best fighters in its ranks would face each other in full contact with one winner emerging as the superior warrior, the champion. The Kokoruki has been joined by the International Fighting Arts Association as cosponsor for this event and as the guardians of a rich and powerful heritage. After three days, one fighter will prove himself to be the best. May the mightiest warrior prevail. [ALL CHEERING] [ALL SHOUTING IN FOREIGN LANGUAGE] Now, remember, it's full contact. There are three ways to win. One, you knock the guy out. Two, your opponent quits and shouts "mate". It's like saying "uncle". Three, you throw the fucker right off the runway. [REFEREE SHOUTS IN FOREIGN LANGUAGE] Piece of cake. [REFEREE SHOUTS IN FOREIGN LANGUAGE] [SHOUTS IN FOREIGN LANGUAGE] [CROWD CHEERING] That's why they call this "bloodsport", kid. [CROWD CHEERING] Watch this, Frankie. I'm going to show you how it's done, buddy. [ALL SHOUTING] [REFEREE SHOUTS IN FOREIGN LANGUAGE] Asshole! [REFEREE SHOUTS IN FOREIGN LANGUAGE] [CROWD SHOUTING] [BOTH GRUNTING] [GROWLING] [JACKSON YELLS] Come on, get up! Come on! I'm going to kill you, man! Yeah, you, man! You got it! [ALL SHOUTING] Huh, Frankie? Ha! Look at him, buddy! Yeah! Yeah! - You check that out? Thank you. - Good stuff, Jackson. Thanks. - But, uh, what took you so long? - Oh, funny. Real funny. ALL: [CHANTING] Chong Li! Chong Li! Chong Li! - What's going on? - That's Chong Li, the current champ. He's never been defeated. Holds all the records including the fastest kill. He killed a guy during the last kumite. Yep, kicked the poor bastard right in the throat. Guy died right there on the platform. Chong Li stood there and watched him die. [REFEREE SHOUTS IN FOREIGN LANGUAGE] [SHOUTS IN FOREIGN LANGUAGE] [BONES CRACK] [ALL CHEERING] ALL: [CHANTING] Chong Li! Chong Li! Chong Li! [BELL RINGS] Now, I show you some trick or two. [REFEREE SHOUTS IN FOREIGN LANGUAGE] [REFEREE SHOUTS IN FOREIGN LANGUAGE] [REFEREE SHOUTS IN FOREIGN LANGUAGE] [CROWD CHEERING] Whoa! Fastest I ever saw! [GRUNTS] [CROWD CHEERS] Whoa, yeah! [BELL RINGS] His first fight in the kumite, he broke the fucking world record! Yeah! That's my buddy! [REFEREE SHOUTS IN FOREIGN LANGUAGE] [REFEREE SHOUTS IN FOREIGN LANGUAGE] [ALL CHATTERING IN FOREIGN LANGUAGE] Go home! [ALL SHOUTING] [RAWLINS LAUGHS] This is real good stuff. How's your eel? As good as mine? I don't know. I haven't tasted it yet. I think I'll tell them to kill it first. [RAWLINS LAUGHS] - CHEN: You should ask for forks. - Inspector Chen. What a pleasant surprise. Please join us. No, I never eat here. I found some information for you. - What is it, Inspector? - Frank Dux is at the East Lake Hotel. - Thank you. - Thank you. Here, have some eel. OK, Dux, you know why we're here. Taking you back, Frank. Let's go. - Only when the kumite is over. - Who the hell are these two scumbags? Just stay out of it, pal. It's not your business. I ain't your pal, dick face. Look, Frank, the government has invested a lot of time and money in you. Uncle Sam can't afford to let you get hurt. - I won't get hurt. - That's why we're here, to make sure of that. Don't make it tough on us, Frank. I'll be in the airport in two days. It's not good enough. Frank, read my lips. We are taking you back now. Don't make us use 50,000 volts on you, Frank. [JACKSON YELLS] Excuse me. You want to shit sparks? You just stay put, OK? Stay put! [BUS HONKS] [INAUDIBLE DIALOGUE] [MEN LAUGHING] All those different fighters in one event. Sounds wild. - You have to see it to believe it! - Oh, come on, Frank. Couldn't you just get me in? I really want this story. - It would mean so much to me. - They have strict rules. No press. - I bet we could think of something. - I doubt it. You telling me you never break rules? - What do you mean? - Who are Helmer and Rawlins? Just friends. Why? They must be very close friends. They've been inquiring about you all over Hong Kong. What do you want from me? Well, I'd really like you to help me get into the kumite. But, more than that... ...I'd really like to get to know you. After all, we have all night. I have to go. I know. - Good luck today. - Thanks. - Meet me for dinner again tonight? - Sure. About the kumite... I'm sorry. I cannot help you. It's OK. I'll get over it. See you. [SIGHS] [DOOR OPENS THEN CLOSES] Where the hell have you been? You can't just disappear in the middle of kumite like that. I got a rep to uphold, you know? You don't tell me nothing and Jackson don't tell me nothing. You guys are driving me crazy. Right now, hurry up and change. Pick a brick, any brick. I know. The bottom one, right? [JACKSON CLEARS THROAT] [JACKSON GRUNTS] See? Not a scratch on it. Not dim mak. Neither is this. Aah! For you. - Yo, Frankie. - Whoa. I hope we don't bump heads. - Come on. Let's do it, buddy. - Feel strong today? - I feel fine. - Good. You're a good fighter. - You good. - Thanks. This isn't the first time I've had to go undercover to get a story.

He's soft there. - What the hell are you talking about? Chong Li's weak in the gut. That's how Parades surprised him. Hey, you listen to me. Go for the stomach and stay away from his right leg. Will you stop worrying? I've got it under control. You sound like my mother. Man alive! [REFEREE SHOUTS IN FOREIGN LANGUAGE] [REFEREE SHOUTS IN FOREIGN LANGUAGE] [REFEREE SHOUTS THEN JACKSON YELLS] [JACKSON GRUNTING] I got him! What are you doing? Keep going. Jackson! Jackson! Jackson!

Ray, I'm here. Ray? The doctor says you are going to be OK. You are lucky you have a head like a rock. Yeah. You'll be out of here in a week. I'll get back at Chong Li. That's a promise. JANICE: You think that's what he wants? Someone to share a room with? Janice, stay out of this. Frank, I don't want to see you get hurt. Then don't watch. If you want to argue, go elsewhere, please. Sorry. You're not even trying to understand what this means to us. What is there to understand about guys who have to prove themselves - by beating each other's brains? - Why did you become a reporter? - What does that have to do with it? - Answer the question! My father was a reporter. I was a good writer. It seemed like the right thing. And you want to be the best reporter you can be, for him and yourself, right? Yes, that's right. Well, I'm just trying to be the best I can be. Not just for me, for Tanaka, my shidoshi, too. Great, Frank. That's just great! Go right ahead! I just hope you don't end up like Jackson or worse. But I'm not going to stand around and watch it! You're blowing it, Frank. Forget about the girl. Forget about getting back at Chong Li for Ray. You have a chance to take it all tomorrow. You can be the first Westerner to win this thing, but you got to have a clear head. You hear me? You hear me? [CHEN SPEAKS IN FOREIGN LANGUAGE] Why are you interested in stopping the kumite? Someone almost got killed there today. I have a friend fighting in it. I don't want him to get hurt. [OFFICER SPEAKS IN FOREIGN LANGUAGE] [BOTH SPEAK IN FOREIGN LANGUAGE] - Who is your friend? - His name is... Frank Dux. [INAUDIBLE DIALOGUE] [INAUDIBLE DIALOGUE] [CHATTERING IN FOREIGN LANGUAGE] [LAUGHING] You guys here for the finals? There aren't going to be any finals, Dux. - At least, not for you. - Don't try to stop me. We're not. He will. I did not come this far to stop now. You shouldn't have come in the first place. Take him. [SPEAKS IN FOREIGN LANGUAGE] You're really being a hard-ass about this. - Uh, careful. - Put these on - and we won't have to use them. - The last warning, Frank. [ELECTRICITY BUZZING THEN OFFICERS GROAN] Inspector, don't. We've got to take him back. Would you give us a break? We've been chasing you all over Hong Kong. OK, Frank, you win. But it's wrong what you're doing. It's a mistake. I'll meet you at the airport... tomorrow. Now what? How are we going to stop him? Follow me. Time's up. We can't wait any longer. Give me one more minute. I give you my word. He'll be here. - We must follow the rules. - Where is Mr. Dux? I wish everyone would just calm down. I said he'll be here. - Too late. - Too late? No such things as too late. LIN: Ah. Finally. - It's about fucking time! - Sorry. - How do you feel today, Dux? - Feel good. I am ready. Dux's my man.
