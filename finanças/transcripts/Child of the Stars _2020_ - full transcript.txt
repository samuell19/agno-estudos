Very healthy for a preemie There, there, Chi-chan. Spit up twice. Temperature 37.1Â°C. Rash on hands, feet, face Stop crying! I don't know what to do! The water's bad for her. The water? The water. 'Venus Blessed' Cosmic Energy Water 'Increased immunity' 'Clear skin.' 'Weak constitution.' 'Sleeplessness' Venus Water Mr. Orchiai said to just stroke gently. Gently, gently. Milk 7 times, spit up once. 4 pees, yellowish. 3 poops. Redness going away! The water's got a special life force. Well? Yes. I never have colds any more. Hang on... She's better! Now I can really say that. Cosmic Energy The Power of the Stars Here we go... The Story of a Miracle Chihiro Hayashi A Life Saved By Cosmic Energy CHILD OF THE STARS And now Mr. Minami, our new Math teacher He'll be teaching the Year 2s... and Year 3A and B. Thank you. I am Hayato Minami, Math teacher. My best point is my enthusiasm. This morning, between the parking lot and the staff room... twelve students greeted me with enthusiasm. Because of that, Hayato Minami is all fired up. I will also be interacting with you as coach for girls tennis. So please come out. Ms. Yokomori... I'd like to join the tennis club. You're the third one, Chihiro. 3rd Year is too late to start. This is important, so listen carefully. Different numbers inside the root sign... Can be added or subtracted... by converting them to A root B. Let's see what this means. Example 3. V18 plus V8. It looks like we can't combine these two different roots. But can we can convert both V18 and V8? V18 is V9 x 2, and V9 is 3, so 3 comes out, giving 3V2. V8 is V4 x 2. V4 is 2, so we can write that 2/2. With the same numbers tn the root sign, we can calculate with them. All right? The answer is 35/2 + 2V2. 5V 2. Hayato Minami Birthday: May 3rd Sign. Taurus Blood Type. A Win the Fall Tournament! Nice! Charge the ball! Nice! I wish I was at the beach! What? Minami said that. 'I wish I was at the beach!' I wish I was in his make-up class. He comes in tennis wear! Let's change gears here. It's September now. Summer's over. It's six months to high-school entrance exams. They'll be here before you know it. Study hard, so you won't be sorry. Today it's quadratic equations. They're on most entrance exams, so make sure you understand them. Page 81. All right? Six months to goodbye We see the value of y is increasing. Next. When the function y equals x, and a is less than zero. Look at this graph. As x increases in value... but remains less than zero, you see how the value of y rises. When x equals zero, so does y. When x is greater than zero, the value of y... grows smaller. All right? This ts exactly the same as explained in your text. However, there's one thing to watch out for. Edward Furlong Minami is a Japanese Edward Furlong Edward Furlong. What? Edward Furlong's really handsome. Next to him, all the guys in my class looked ugly. Even Saijo. Then everyone else, girls and the teachers, too... looked dirty. Hair all messy and greasy. Stupid-looking snot-noses... laughing like idiots. They made me feel sick. Then, the next day... you all looked ugly to me. And in the mirror I looked the ugliest of all. What? That's stupid. Ta-da! Put in the eyedrops twice a day, in the morning and before bed. And wear these glasses. The lenses are specially treated... to fix the distortion. Great, huh? Right? They look weird. No, they don't. They're great! Right? Those glasses are weird, right? They sure are! Really weird. Why the glasses? They're weird. Are they? Yeah. My sister said so, too. So if you wear them people don't look ugly any more? OK, what about that man? Ugly. So do they work? Maybe. What about that lady? Ugly. Is that funny? What about your own face? I'm the ugliest of all. I never look in a mirror. So you don't see your nose hairs. Liar! I don't have nose hairs. How do you see me? Pretty. What about him? Ugly. The boys I liked: The one going by on his bike, with the great eyebrows. Morita, from the baseball team. He was tall. And Kanzaki, with beautiful fingers. You're not sick. Then what? You just care about looks. Wait, Watanabe! Were into end-of-term quizzes. There are easy marks to be had if you listen. So let's ace these last few tests. There's not much time. Don't be sorry. Now let's look at the area and volume of similar 3-dimensional objects... as in the diagram we have here. Graduation Thank you. It was fun. What's new here is the volume ratio. And we find that by cubing the factors we've already derived... Did you hear that Minami was hitting on a tennis club girl? Yes. Isn't that creepy? Just a rumor. What do you see in him? You're jealous. That I'm in love. You just need a new boyfriend. I have a new one. Liar! It's true! That guy who came with Misaki and her boyfriend for pizza. From Miyamae High? That's great. We went to a movie. I showed him our class picture. He said you were cute. He said he could bring a friend to meet you. Why? I said no. I said your parents were in a cult and going broke. So he said 'Forget it.' Oh. Anyway... your sister's still missing, right? No. She just doesn't come home. Oh. Wait up! I'll walk with you. Ma-chan! You're home! Ma-chan! I bought some chocolate-chip buns. The kind you like. That's some hole. You put it there fighting with Dad. It's all your fault. You're always sick. Mm. Are you staying tonight? Yeah. Do you have a cold? You sound like it. Ma-chan smelled like garbage. I was holding my nose. Chi-chan! You smell nice. Weird things happen. Yuck! You'll get to like it. I will? Is there a boy you like? Yeah. What's he like? He's tall, and he's good at soccer. He can sing, and he can do handstands. That's cool. What about you? Yep. What's he like? He's short, he can't play soccer. He can't sing or do handstands. A jerk who drinks a lot of coffee. What do you like about him? Yeah, what? Nothing? If I have to say... the way he sighs. Sighs? He sighs a lot. Like, "Agh!" He just sounds so dragged-out when he sighs that I think... anyone that dragged out must be a good guy. Huh? You don't get it. No. Have you ever kissed someone? Sorry! Have you ever... wanted to get married? Nope. You'll stay single? Yeah. Or no. I've never thought about it. Yeah, you're still in Grade 4. Grade 5. Oh. What about you? Marriage? Yeah. I'd like to. I'm going to. You're getting married? Not right away. To that guy? Invite me to the wedding. Wedding, huh? With a dress? A dress... And the honeymoon? Honeymoon... Hawaii? France? Or America? Hollywood? Can I come, too? I'm getting sleepy. Lets go to bed. I'm not sleepy yet. You've got school. Let's get some sleep. Let's talk again tomorrow. Stay over again. Sure. I won't be back. Bye-bye. We're back. Hi. Mrs. Ochiai made all this food thinking you'd be at meeting. But you had school. You'd think she'd realize. Her son Hiroyuki isn't getting any better. He's not in school so she probably didn't think. Yeah? Are you coming Sunday? Yes. Mrs. Ochiai says she'll be there. Don't forget to thank her. What about dinner? There's rice and the rest of the tofu. And cookies. I'd like to meet this Mr. Minami. Teachers don't visit students homes. There's the home visit, but he's not a home-room teacher, I'd just like to meet someone you like so much. Thanks. Do you wash those clothes? Sure... sometimes. Right? Tuesday, November 7th Question 1. With horizontal lines l, m, and n... find x. The lines are horizontal, so you can use the formula. One. We apply the formula. x is to 1.8 as 4 is to 2. x equals 5.6. Easy, right? Two. Ignore the intersecting line and just apply the formula. x equals 48 over 5. Did you get that? Chi-chan! Let's skip Phys-ed and go to the Nurse's Office. Are you feeling sick? I told Sakai I needed something for my period. It's not true. Come with me. But I haven't... It'll be OK! Just this once. No. Come with me. Nurse Asami? She's not here. Here. Have this. Yeah? I've got lots. Thanks. You're coming on the trip? Yeah. It'll be fun. We'll have Mr. Kairo's special fried noodles again. They're great! I tried them at home but it wasn't the same. You cook, Haru? Yeah. You know there's a problem with Mr. Kairo? No. A woman says he cheated her. She's filed a complaint. A rumor, right? But this time it looks serious. Ms. Shoko's not coming to Meeting. Yeah. They say she and Mr. Kairo confined the woman. The rumor is that they called her to his apartment. They kept her there, Ms. Shoko hypnotized her... So she bought these expensive crystals. Is that true? It's true that Ms. Shoko can hypnotize, but she says she didn't do it. They say she's angry that people are accusing her. Her ESP is famous. She's always happy to tell you about your aura or past lives. She did yours, right? She said my aura was light pink. Mine was red. Anyway, they're busy now proving they're innocent. Maybe they're keeping out of sight... until it dies down. You again? Nurse Asami I've got cramps real bad. Her, too. Your stomach always hurts. Do you have any coffee? Oh, right. You don't drink coffee. 'Venus Dressed Water', was it? Is that in this tea, too? It's 'Venus Blessed'. Can you taste it? I guess so, sort of. It tastes... Sweet? Yes! That's it. It's sweet. Yes! Would you like some more? Sure. Take some home. Kengo's worried about his height, isn't he? He should drink it. It's just water. It's not milk. Try it for a week and you'll see. No, thanks. It really works! You wet a thin piece of gauze and set it lightly where the problem is. Like a poultice. It'd help with Wakako's hernia. She had an operation for that just last week. She did? I wish you'd told me sooner. Yeah, I guess I should have. I'll be going. Already? See you. Uncle Yuzo was very nice. That's weird. Set it there, very lightly. Lightly. There. Put it on your head. No, you try it. No? OK, I'll show you. Thanks. All you do is put it on your head... and then relax. And? It's great. Really great. Great how? How can I describe it? All the muscle tension is gone. If I don't wear it or drink the water, I feel it right away. All my numbers go crazy. Physically I just fall apart. Um... Try it. Go on. That's not Venus Water. It's tap water from a park. What do you mean? You're being funny. I told you! It's purified in a special ceremony. I switched it. Everything in that box. The water? I poured it out. You what?! All of it. The water in which dwells cosmic energy? Nonsense. It's nothing but tap water. And you didn't realize. For two months you've been happily drinking water... from a park tap. Open your eyes, will you? You're lying! I'm not. Look at the bottom of the bottles. The ones I signed are tap water. Ma-chan helped. We switched all that water, didn't we. Get out! Out! Out! Get out! And never come back! Never! Go away! Go away! Cut it out! Go away! Stop it! Come on. We'll come back for the kids. Stop it! I can't trust you with my sister any more! Stop it! Go away! Go away! Ma-chan! What are you doing? Go away! All right, all right! OK. I'll be back. Don't come back! When Uncle and I were planning it, I thought it would work. Then I had the scissors. Yeah? Yeah. I didn't know why. I'd called him and told him Mom and Dad were out. He came and switched the water. Here. It's hot. Weird things happen. Yuck! You'll get to like it. Tell me again Why we can't drink coffee. It weakens the power. What about me, Ms. Shoko? Your is light pink, Chihiro. Daisuke's dark brown. I want to be blue! Brown's fine. Satoko's grey. I want to be pink, too. Haru's is... red. Your aura's red. I hate it. Haru says she hates it. She doesn't look passionate, but she is. Dark and selfish. Yep. She never opens 'Star Child'. Her coming here has nothing to do with her own will. She's simply following a message she's received. She doesn't think that, of course. You're all the same. Why do you come? I like âWork Time'. Me, too! And reading 'Star Child'. You all love studying, then? That's why you're here. But can you really say it's your own will? Akane, how is it different when you're here... and when Haru's here? Akane... if Haru really doesn't want to be here... why does she come every week? Because... Because? All is the will of the Cosmos. Mr. Kairo! Mr. Kairo, you're late! It's true Haru is only using her physical eyes. But she's trying her best to see. She tries, even though she can't. From her own will... she can't see anything, and she can't go anywhere. But she'll change. She'll start to talk? And sing and dance. And fly in the sky. No one can do that! The time of realization comes, and then that person changes. Lurker! Hayashi! Don't scare me like that. Are you spying on Watanabe again? Don't call it "spying". Shall I get her? I thought we might study together. - Shinmura... - No... She says no. I'll come back. You're trying hard. Until she forgives me. But you two broke up. So what? You're still stalking Minami. And you're stalking Watanabe. What do you know? Only that you broke up. No, we didn't. Then what? It's just a spat. She has a bad temper. Hurry up. Wait! Want some help? Go home if you like. You should make up with him. Or are you really breaking up? Shinmura's a good guy. Then you date him. He's not really my type. He's not bad, though. Looks again. Sorry. You're lucky. Boys never like you back. Is that a put-down? You seem happy that way. "The gentle May breeze on the peak did not soothe the heat of..." Stop it! Is this about Minami? Stop it! It's a poem! That water's expensive, right? Don't waste it. Store water's cheaper, but followers buy it in bulk. Give me a taste. Eww! Then give it back. I'd prefer juice. This is special water. A famous scholar said so. Who? I forget. Some famous guy from a university. Some fake? No! Hes a relative of Mr. Kairo. Really? Maybe this Mr. Kairo's being scammed. Who by? This fake. Mr. Kairo's really rich. He's way up there. That fat liar? That's Hiroyuki. Mr-Kairo speaks English and German. His girlfriend went to the same school. The one who sees auras? Yes. Ms. Shoko. Maybe she's being scammed, too. No way. Then someone's scamming the scholar. Who? I don't know. But then that person is being scammed by someone else again. And that person... Stop. Are you being scammed? Me? No, I'm not. You scared me! What do you want? You scared me! What do you want? Hayashi asked me to help. We'll be done faster with three. He'll just mess everything up. It'll be fine. No! I'll go get some juice then. What would you like? Orange juice. And you pay. No, thanks. Back in one minute. Shinmura's nice, isn't he. Maybe. Or he's thirsty himself. He's nice. Then date him. Didn't we go through that? Yeah. You're going to marry him. Why say that? No? That's a long way off. But your honeymoon's planned. France, right? He told you? France is great! I'm not going there. You're not? You go on a honeymoon with him if you want. Why me? A minute! Did you time me? No? No! Why would we do that? Loser! And I ran! Are you still here? Don't do that! It's past lock-up time. We got permission. That's good till 5:30. Again tomorrow? Your parents will be worried. It's dark. Aren't you leaving? Yes. As soon as you do. So hurry up. If you're leaving, give us a ride. Don't be silly. Why not? You have a car. You're young. You can walk. You want middle-school kids out on dangerous streets at night? It's only 5:30. You're the one who said it's dark. Oh, I get it. You'll drive Ms. Sakura of the tennis club... but not the members of the Essay Album committee. We'll sit in the back. Go for it. Thank you. Take care. Wait! There's someone strange. Strange? By the slide. A pair of them. Like we said at assembly today. There's more and more of them. Weirdos out of season. What are they doing? They're crazy. They're gone. Now what? Now what?! Ma-chan! Can you hear me? Where are you? It's all because I was sick? Ma-chan? Ma-chan. You're late. Hi. Mrs. Ochiai ordered too much for Hiroyuki's lunch. She said to take some for you, so I took her up on it. Hiroyuki doesn't like shellfish. No, thanks. No? I don't want it. Are you sick? I'm fine. A cold? Does your head ache? Then eat up. - Sit down. No fever. You're not hungry? Does your stomach hurt? Are you OK? Don't! Stop it! Hold still! This works! Help! Chi-chan! Is anyone in there? Yes. You see... the Ochiai boy, Hiroyuki... he's really sick. Will he die? He's not going to die. It's just that he can't talk. I'm like Hiroyuki. I don't want to talk. I don't want to. Mr. Minami... Don't talk about it. Thank you. Don't talk about it, I said. They're saying I took you for a drive. Watanabe and Shinmura were there! Damn it! The Head Teacher will be on my case again. Mr. Minami! The bell's gone! Is it true? Your date. Of course not! He's mad! Sir... yesterday... those people in the park were my parents. The weirdos in the park. They were... I'm lying. I'm having chills. Chihiro Hayashi, from 3C? 3B. Oh, that's right. I'll take your temperature. Sit over there. Oh, dear. Lie down. You should go home. Shall I call your house? I can go alone. Anyway, lie down. Nurse Asami? Yes? Yesterday I fell asleep with water spilled on me. Why? I don't catch colds. Oh? Because I drink this water. But is this a cold? Probably. I'm going. You're sick. You should stay home. Yes. I'll see you. 7th-year Memorial Service Hope to see you. Yuzo Yokota It's been a long time since we had the chance to talk to you like this. You drink coffee? Yes. I see. Are your parents well? Yes. Really good. Good. Are they at home today? They've gone to meeting today. Oh. Has Ma-chan been in touch? No. That's a worry. Yes. I wanted the Mont Blanc. Why did I get cheesecake? It's good. Yes, it's very good. Kengo says you're going to Seno High School. If I get in. Are you studying? Not very much. Tutor her, Kengo. I'll be here till next week. Could you? The school's near our house. Yes. How about... attending from our place? I know it's sudden. Right? I've thought that for a while. We thought that for middle school, too. It's too late for that. I have my room. My university's in Tokyo. Yes! Well? You don't have to decide now... The sooner the better. What do you really think? Really think? I'm fine where I am. Where you are? My house now. I know your place would be closer. That's not the reason we're saying this. I know. Really? Yes. I understand. Look, Chihiro... We've been thinking that maybe you should step back a bit... from your parents. But I've never wanted to leave the way Ma-chan did. That's what worries me. Kengo! She just doesn't understand! Sorry, Chihiro. He's worried about you. Don't worry. I'm fine, Kengo. Nobody's bothering me, and I'll be OK for money. I'll work part-time tn high school... and pay uncle back for the school trip money. That's not a concern. This isn't about money. You can decide later. We'd like you to think about it after you get home. I'll still think the same. Morning. You're early. Whoa! Those are great. They're all Mr. Minami, right? They're not? They're Edward Furlong. Who? An American actor. He started as a teenager. This is a sketch? Yes. Show it to me when it's finished, will you? I wont finish it. Why not? I'm tired of it. That's a waste. You should finish it. You think so? If I finish it, do you want it? Guess not, huh? Isn't it important? I guess so, but there's no point in keeping it. You can have them all. All of them? You can use the backs for note paper. OK. There's 12 of them. I'll staple them together a when they're done. Thanks. Mr Sasaki's got the flu, So I'm taking your home room today. The flu's going around, so read this. I'll read it out. Quiet! Are you always like this? 'Let's build up our resistance. Jack Frost is on his way. 'Does anyone have a cold?' Listen! 'Especially you in 3rd year. Entrance exams-draft in the New Year. 'You cannot-afford to get sick now. 'It's not just one virus. All these things can affect you.' Are you listening? Yes 'Influenza, norovirus, and RS virus... 'They're most active at this time of year.- Mr. Sasaki was vaccinated, and still, got sick. You never know when it will strike. You can't see a virus. That's why it's dangerous. 'But not everyone catches a virus. 'Why are some infected while others are not? 'Resistance. Some of you are listening and some are not. This is in lessons as well. I'm saying important things and you're drawing me! I've put up with it, but I've had enough. Chihiro Hayashi! You get on my nerves. Put that pencil away. And that weird water, too! Sir... those pictures shes drawing aren't pictures of you. They're pictures of a foreign boy. Ed... Edward Furlong. I don't care! You shouldn't be scribbling in class. You too, Kamamoto! And Hayashi. You come to school to learn. Not to write graffiti or sell religion. If water could save you, no one would get colds. Tell your folks that. That's it. Stand. Bow. That asshole. Howdy! Wow! What do you want? We were going to the library. Go away. Why? What's wrong? Shut up. I'm asking Hayashi. Those weirdos in the park... were my parents. I know. They were? Wow I didn't know. That was your old man? Sorry. Don't apologize. I thought it was a river sprite. Idiot! He was all in green with a plate on his head. And water being poured on him. That was my mom. Really? Pouring the water onto a wet cloth protects you from evil influences. They believe that. Oh. They believe that? Do you? I don't know! I don't know, but neither of them ever gets a cold. I never get colds. You're too stupid. If you're not going to marry Shinmura, can I? No. Or get engaged? No. You know... the Ochiai boy, Hiroyuki. He can talk. Hello. All set to go? Morning. Where's your mother, Haru? Over there, in Bus 1. We'll go say hello. Come on. Up there? Hello. Hello! You've grown! Morning. A schoolbook? He insisted. Don't tell me... Your boyfriend? He's coming? He wanted to. I'm jealous! You're on a different bus from your mom and dad. There's a message for you in that. If you lose, that's three. That one! Sanae loses! I quit, Chi-chan. You're no good at it. It's just bad luck. I saw Ms. Shoko before we got on the bus. Is that OK? They say Mr. Kairo gets people drunk and Ms. Shoko hypnotizes them. You're sure she can do that? That's what everyone says. You doubt it? No. Let's not talk about it. I'm M-23. G-37. See you. 'From the Great Cosmos 'The blessings of light pour down upon us 'Filling us for all eternity' To speak to a stranger is to take one step into the Cosmos. It is now time to speak together. I'm delighted to speak with a lady like you. Sorry. You can trust me. Are you alone? Me? I came alone. Not because I wanted to. My grandmother said to come. She's dying in hospital. I'm here in her place. She's giving me Â¥300,000. Â¥300,000?! Nothing strange about that. You can't take it with you. You still doubt me? No. But is this group really all right? The net said people went missing after the group ganged up on them. What? I just haven't seen mom. Put your hand on your head. Apply pressure. Raise your hand a little. Again it's time to speak together. Middle School? Yes. What year? Third. Just like my son! Mr. Kairo's making noodles! He is?! You like squid? Special just for you. Ready! Chi-chan, your mom and dad were looking for you. Thanks. Where were they? In front of your room. You're in a different room from your mom this year. We came on different buses. Green pepper? No. Your parents aren't here. Not me. How about you? No? I wish just once I'd get chosen. And now please welcome the Chosen for today. Please lend an ear to their pledge to the stars. I hereby pledge to spend the rest of my life... ministering to those who are poor of spirit! I'm convinced that it is my role here... to combat global warming... reduce CO2 emissions, and through faith express my gratitude to the stars. I promise that again next year I will be a candidate... for Environmental Beautification Officer! Your mom isn't here. It's been a while. What should we do now? Cards? Back from the bath? Yes. You're red. We took a while. Good night. Chi-chan... Did you see your mom? Where was she? On the terrace, with your dad. Thank you. You're lost, aren't you. Your being here has nothing to do with your own will. She saw your mom? Go find her. I'll hold that. I'll be right back. Mom? Did you find her? She wasn't there. And your dad? No. That's weird. I'll go out again. Where? The lobby. Again? Why not wait here? I'll be back. She wasn't there. But... You'd best wait here. You'll keep missing each other and never meet again. Why would you say that? Don't exaggerate. . Sorry. Me, too. I don't know why, but I feel really anxious. You're really close, aren't you. You'll see her soon. Just wait a bit. Mom! Finally! Where were you? I was looking all over. So was I. What? Do you want to come for a walk? Now? I found a place where the stars are really beautiful. You can see them from all over. It's a special place. What time ts it? Did you bring a watch? You need to look. The bath closes at 11. Right now we don't care about the time. Shall we sit? I'm glad you brought that. How's your studying going? Why do you ask that? I was just wondering. I'm studying. Good. Are you confident? About getting in? I won't say. I'll look bad if I say yes and I don't get in. Seno High? Yeah. It's a long way. Yeah. You know what? Ma-chan... had a baby. She called? When? She told us, then she hung up. A baby... She's OK! Great, huh? Chi-chan, are you OK? What? A shooting star. Where? There. Did you see it? No. You both missed it? They go fast. You have to watch. Up there. I saw that one! Me, too. Did you? No. Why not? You can't blink! Enough. Let's go back. The bath will be closed. We've come all this way. A cold? I'm fine. Do you have a tissue? There! You saw one? I did. Really? Really. All three of us have to see it. Right? But what about the bath? Forget the time. Just watch. A little longer, then. Nothing. Nope. Not yet.
