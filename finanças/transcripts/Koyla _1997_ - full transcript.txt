You're wonderful! That he is! Who made him as brave as a lion?! I have done it! Who changed a weak man into a strong man?! I have done it! Bloody fool! Your Highness! Your Highness!

I found her to be beautiful. So I caught her hand. Your Highness... ...why are you slapping your dear brother? He is foolish from his childhood! You shut up, doctor! Listen to me carefully, Brijwa! The daughter of every worker is... ...like my daughter or daughter-in-law! I am the king... ...and they are my subjects! Brijwa, after worshipping God... ...they worship me! Go away! Bloody fool! Wow! Wow! Wow! Wow! I am watching the justice... ...which used to be done at the time of Jahangir! A brother slaps his real brother! When he slapped Brijwa... ...I felt very bad!

Ladies and gentlemen... ...I am Mr. Tolmol... ...I talk confusingly... ...but I reveal everyone's secrets! What nonsense are you talking! I am telling you the history of this village.

Dad, he is telling you what your real name is! You are stupid and I am your fool! Why are you doing such foolish things... ...along with this clown?! See! I am continuing the trend of being a doctor... ...after my forefathers! I know what you are doing! You are cheating the rich people! - Shut up! Doctor... - Yes! Make my husband a little powerful. Make your husband a little powerful? She means to say that the tablet that you... ...gave her previously, that power... Yes, that tablet had an effect on me. Yes... - Yes... - Yes! Just wait and watch! I'll give you such a tablet this time, that... that's it! Dad, why are you ruining their lives? I am making their lives younger and enthusiastic. You are not making their lives enthusiastic... ...but you are ruining it! It'll have no effect! Nothing will happen! Why? Because, dad, you are trying to... ...play the sitar with broken strings! Is he not in tune?! You are talking about tune! This entire sitar is out of order! And this model won't work, will it, sister?! You are right. I am implicated! - Yes! Will you people just keep on talking?! Did you eat or drink anything? I'm making them eat. You make them drink. Shankar. Give it to me. All the guests have come! Where is the king? Sir... what is this, sir?! You made me slap my Brijwa, didn't you? That's why now I'll kill you! But sir... ...your brother misbehaves with our... ...daughters and daughter-in-laws... - Shut up! You scoundrel! Your child gets nourished in the womb of his mother later, ...but first he becomes my slave! I'll do whatever I want! I'll use your wife, sons, daughters... ...and daughters-in-law how I want! They are my property! No, sir, we will revolt. We'll definitely revolt. Let the animals eat him. What are you doing here? What did you see? You didn't see? What did you see? Tell me! What did you see? Brijwa? What are you doing?! He saw something, but he's not telling me! Tell me! Have you ever seen a coal talking? Have you ever seen a mountain talking? You need a voice to talk. How will this boy talk? He is dumb. He is dumb. I know that he is dumb, but he saw. Ask him! Shankar. Brijwa... ...I am illiterate... ...but I read the eyes of... ...this dumb from the time he was a child. I read. He didn't see anything. Go, Shankar. You go. Good party! Wonderful party! Wonderful! Today you are too drunk! I have enjoyed drinking a lot of liquor, secretary. Today I'll enjoy with girls! You talk such things when you are intoxicated. Bindiya darling... ...God has made you so beautiful! Then why do you cover your body with clothes all the time?! Remove them! I'll praise you! You are so excited as if you never saw me before! This is the miracle of God! Guard! You are a fool! I have been coming and going from the past 20 years... ...and you shoot me every time! It's the king's order to shoot. The king cannot live without my medicines! Now if you shoot me even by mistake... ...then you'll indeed die. If the king doesn't kill you, then Brijwa will definitely kill you! What are you doing?! What are you doing?! What are you doing?! Your Highness! Your Highness! Your Highness! Your Highness! Your Highness! Why are you screaming?! You have no enemy! Then what are these guards these dogs... ...and these bullets for?! For what?! - Look doctor, ...grass and enmity... ...can grow anywhere and anytime. And afterall, I am the King.

You gave me such a tablet... ...that I again went to sleep in the night! I again got insulted in front of the secretary! Your Highness, it's not the fault... ...of the tablet. - Then whose fault is it? It's the model's fault. - From where will... ...I get a better model in this age?! Look carefully! God has made such beautiful models! Gauri, I... Gauri! Listen! What did you people do?! We have eaten the sweets... - Yes, we have! Those sweets were made up of cannabis! You have created a problem for your own self! Cannabis sweets... - Cannabis sweets! We have created a problem for ourselves! Everything will seem to be upside down!

Her figure is so huge! You fool, I'm not talking about that fatso... ...but I'm talking about her daughter! Beautiful! Beautiful! Why are you laughing! Have you drunk cannabis?! Yes! You have become so big, but you still play with children! I wonder when you'll come to your senses! When I haven't gone from my senses then how will Icome to my senses?! Oh God! Your parents are dead! They didn't leave even a penny behind! They just left their daughter with me! And that brother of yours is enjoying in Dubai! He has left this trouble with me! Aunt, say whatever you want about me... ...but don't even say a word about brother! He sends money from Dubai every month. That's why this house runs, or else we all... ...would have starved to death! Ok! Now get ready soon! We have to attend a wedding! Your Highness! Welcome, Your Highness! Welcome! Your Highness, I thought you' forget an ordinary man like me! You came as an ordinary inspector in my area... ...and you retired as a D.I.G.! How can I forget a personality like you! I was... What a piece! Beautiful! Wonderful! Your Highness, the time has changed... ...but your habits haven't. Hello, D.I.G.! Hello! Hello! Congratulations for your daughter's marriage! Thank you very much for attending my... ...daughter's wedding, Mr. Raghunath! Your daughter got married, D.I.G. Now think about our niece also! Your niece is precious! You shouldn't have a problem in getting her married. Congratulations! Congratulations! The king has said! This means... ...he is taking the responsibility of getting her married! King! - Yes! He is the king of dooms land! Fandhegarh! Fandhegarh! - Your Highness! Thank you very much, Your Highness! Hello, Your Highness! Gauri, even you touch the king's feet! He has taken the responsibility of your marriage. Yes, touch his feet, dear! - Yes, touch his feet, dear! Touch his feet! Your Highness, the girl made faces and went away! The matter will be very simple! Gauri! Gauri! Gauri called me! I'm coming! Wait! Wait, Gauri! Gauri! I'm coming! Gauri! Your Highness... - Gauri! Your Highness... - Gauri! Gauri! - Your Highness! Doctor. What is going on?! - Going on! Your Highness, you were about to die! I jumped and caught you! Get up! Get up! Hold my hand! My back! The nerves of your hand are running like a water-pump! All this is because of Gauri! After thinking about Gauri... not only my nerves... ...but everything has started running! Everything! Doctor... ...that girl has charmed me. Wherever I see... ...I find Gauri. - Your Highness... ...see Gauri wherever you want... ...but not near the window... ...otherwise you'll become handicapped! Marriage! Don't force me, aunt! You expect me to marry the one whom... But Gauri... - I've never seen and I don't know! Friends, can someone marry without seeing the boy? Never! Never! - See! Shut up, you naughty children! Go away! Go! Dear, we are your aunt and uncle. We are like your parents. Dear, whatever we'll think about... ...you we'll think for your betterment... - Yes! And he is a very rich man! But... - He has a lot of money! Aunt... - You'll rule! But... - You'll live like a queen, you fool! Like a queen! Whether I live like a queen or a princess... ...but unless I see the boy, I won't marry. Everything is ruined! Brother-in-law's face is not worth watching! Gopal! If the horse is ready, then bring him. "If I talk, then people will say that I'm talking too much." Why are you staring at me? This means... you... you are not dumb! The one who is considering me dumb... ...is blind and he is a scoundrel! Brother, but... from when have you started talking?! From the past... 15-20 years. You mean, from so many years, you were... Pretending to be dumb, to know all your secrets. You thought that he is dumb! He won't tell anything to anyone! But now I'll go to the king and tell him everything... ...what you people talk about him! No, brother! I beg of you! Please forgive me! Otherwise along with this job, I'll lose my life also! Whether you lose your life or anything else... ...but I'll have to tell him. No, brother! Please forgive me once! Hey, you chicken-heart pigeon! You filth of the stable! Shankar was just moving his lips! I was talking in Shankar's voice! What?! You are worrying for no reason! See, I was talking like that! He was just moving his lips. The practice of childhood has... ...come to use in the youth, got it?! Got it?! You mean you both fooled me! Who is not fooling in this world? Every man is fooling the other. Like you have been fooled! What are you doing?! You think I'm a horse! I'll beat you! I'll beat you! Your Highness! Your Highness! Your Highness! Yes! There's some good news! There's some good news! Aunt has agreed for the marriage! What?! - Yes! Even the uncle is ready! And what about Gauri?! - She is refusing. She is refusing? But why? Am I not perfect? The mirror never lies. See. Your Highness, I have a cure for every sorrow! Why are you sad?! This! What will happen if I have this tonic? This is not supposed to be eaten but... ...this is supposed to be applied. What... - On your hair. If your hair becomes black, then it'll make some difference! My hair will become black... ...but what about this face full of wrinkles?! How will I change this? Yes! I'll send. I'll send a photo. What is all this? - We have accepted... ...the marriage proposal for you! Without asking me! - Dear... ...this poor man has become rich! The boy is a gem! Gem! - Yes, dear! Aunt, I already told you, and I'm saying again that... ...I won't get married without seeing the boy. See his photograph. If you don't like him, then all the... ...auspicious gifts... - Will be returned right now. Then show me. Show her! - Yes, see. See! Brother-in-law's photo! See! Brother-in-law's photo! Wait... - See! Brother-in-law's photo! Brother-in-law looks like a hero! He's so handsome! He's such a nice brother-in-law, isn't he? Yes! She didn't see the photo? Gauri! Gauri! Gauri, where's the photo?! Gauri, where's the photo?! 'Brother-in-law looks like a hero! ' 'He's so handsome! ' 'He's such a nice brother-in-law, isn't he? ' 'Why are you looking at me like that? ' You... you even talk! 'I can talk, and I can also see you.' You are just a photo... ...and a photo can neither hear, nor see! 'I can even touch you if you want.' Really! Then touch me. "When I saw you... ...I went crazy." "If I attain you..." "I hope I don't die..." "When I saw you... ...I went crazy." "if I attain you... "I hope I don't die... "I came to live with you." "I brought my heart and soul to give to you." "When I saw you... ...I truly began to live." "If I attain you... ...death would offer no grief." "through good fortune..." "I gained so much love...

You are telling the truth! - Yes! Then tell me! Tell me the truth! Why am I dyeing my hair? Because your heart is black! You are matching it with that! - Shut up! You're wrong! I'm dyeing my hair thinking about marriage! Dad! Good that you have thought about marriage! Even I'm going crazy thinking about marriage! Aren't you... - Yes! Then we'll have to conduct the marriage now! This is the right time to conduct it! Now the marriage is done! The marriage is done! Dad, with whom? With the one who comes to this house everyday. Who comes to our house everyday and cooks food! Yes, the one... ...who handles all our work! Dad! You are getting me married with Rasili! - Yes! What?! Rasili is my to-be wife... ...and your to-be mother! Mother! No! She is my to-be wife! She's your daughter-in-law! Daughter-in-law! No! She's mine... - She's mine! She's mine... - She's mine! She's mine! Rasili! Both of you... both of you called me together?! Yes! - Oh God! Rasili! Rasili, you tell us, who do you love? Me, or my fatso father?! Don't blush! This is the time to become shameless! Become, Rasili! Become shameless. Tell us, who do you love? Tell us. Tell us... - Tell us! Both of you! Now you stand up for the auspicious rounds. Make the bride stand ahead. Dad, what is all this? - What? The king is changing the system of marriage. - Why? Becoming the groom, he was riding the horse... ...in the veranda of his own house! Now he is taking the auspicious rounds... ...for marriage in his own house! He is changing the whole system! - Keep quiet! He is the king! Whatever he is doing is right. - He is right! Priest, you read the holy prayers. This is the last round. I'll handle her. But... Read the holy prayers. The auspicious rounds of the bride and the groom have completed. Now give them blessings. You... I... how did I come here? I am your husband! I have brought you here after taking the seven auspicious rounds! No! No! They were not the auspicious rounds! I don't agree to those rounds! I don't agree to this marriage! You have cheated me! You have cheated me! Sweetheart, whether you call it cheating or fraud... ...but I have won the game. Today I'll fulfil all my desires! I have married you! Marriage! Marriage! If you come close to me... then... I'll scream. All the brides scream in the first night of marriage. You also scream. You can... you can never attain me! Help! Help! You will kill me! I'll kill myself! Forget about this birth, but you can't... ...attain Gauri in any birth! I will never accept you as my husband. I'd rather die than accept you! Your life is my property now. No! Your life and death is in my hands. Everything is in my hands. I can rape you right now, if I want... ...but I won't. Because I want to... ...play the game of husband and wife with you... - No! That's why I married you. But... ...now it's the matter of stubbornness. Now I'll rape you... ...when you permit me. I will definitely wait for that day, Gauri! I'll wait! No! No! You are laughing and making me feel more hurt! I'm seeing... ...l'm thinking... ...and I'm shocked. You have brought a flower who is more beautiful... ...and prettier than me, you couldn't smell its ...you couldn't smell its fragrance. Bindiya, I have heard that a woman... ...understands another woman. Change that woman so much... ...that she goes crazy for me. Your Highness... Don't question me. I'll give you a lot of money. ...to dress that girl as a bride... ...and bring her in tomorrow's funtion... ...is you job. "The moon is hidden under the veil." "Still the... ...the brightness is spread all over." "The moon is hidden under the veil." "Still there is brightness all over." "The one who watches her enthusiastically... ...might lose his wits."

This bullet could have been shot on you also... ...but my brother is being stubborn that he wants you. Brother loves you, and I love my brother. Love stopped death. Bloody fool! I bowed in front of your stubbornness! I made Bindiya sit in your place for the function... ...to save the dignity of my house! And you... ...were trying to escape ruining... ...the dignity of my house! Now I'll show you... ...what I am! I have spoken to you very calmly. Now I'll show you my hatred! When you'll fight with thirst and hunger... ...you'll learn how to live by... ...obeying the King's orders, bloody fool! Shankar... ...are you also thinking what I am thinking? I think they are being unjust to that girl. I've been hearing since childhood that something's wrong... ...but everything's completly wrong over here. Everyone is evil-minded. That's why I feel like going deep into this matter. Are you talking about my dad? 'Gopal Gold' tobacco. Who is eating? I am eating. You're eating. You're spitting. If you eat it, then you'll obviously spit it out. You are vomiting. Blurt... blurt out... Got it! You are talking about making dad... ...blurt out what the matter is! Take, darling! Have one more! By saying have one more, you are making me drink... ...like how a camel is given water before... ...he is taken to the desert! Am I a camel?! Am I a camel?! Look, darling, you asked me to come, so I came... - Yes. You asked me to serve you the drinks, I served you... - Yes. You asked me to make you eat, so I made you eat... - Yes! But why didn't you satisfy me? Come, my dear, I'll satisfy you right now! 1, 2, 3, 4, 5! Hey, from where did this fifth hand come?! You fool! Not five, but there are just four hands! Count! Count! Count! 1! 2! 3! 4! There are four hands, but why... ...am I seeing five hands?! Because you are drunk, darling! Oh! Because I'm drunk! What happened, darling?! Who made your darling eat cashew?! There is a fifth hand! There is a fifth hand! There aren't five hands. See! Two are yours and two are mine! There are five hands! Someone is holding you! Someone is holding you! This is your hand! My hand... - You're the one who's holding me! How can it be my hand?! 1, 2, 3, 4, it's gone. Caught it! I caught the fifth hand! This is not the fifth hand, but this is the hand of police! The one who is scared will get trapped... ...into the hand of the police. Why is this police's hand troubling me?! You have committed a crime! Yes! The entire village is saying that you gave... ...such a tablet to the king that he... ...became like a rusted bullet of a gun. Neither did the gun work, nor did it fire. He couldn't enjoy the first night of his honeymoon. You have cheated the king! I have cheated the king! Instead, the king cheated Gauri! How did he cheat her, darling?! What are you saying?! Voice! Voice! I can't say it loudly! What if anyone hears our conversation?! If the king comes to know about this, then he will... Hey! You tell me in my ears. Forget about the King, not even the... ...breeze won't be able to hear us. Tell me! Oh God! Really! Shankar... ...they are being unjust to that innocent girl. That mansion will turn into a cave very soon! Because God has said that... ...wherever the innocent people've cried... ...that place turns into hell! I'm ashamed of the fact that even... ...my dad is a part of all this. And that poor... Shankar... ...see what she's doing. You! The king ruined my life, and you are... ...trying to ruin it all the more. My life has turned into hell because of you! To recieve a small reward from your master... ...you ruined my entire life! You spoilt a girl's life! Such a big betrayal! When you weren't supposed to marry me... ...then why did you send your photograph?! Why did you send this photograph? Looking at this photograph... ...I started dreaming of my future with you. I considered you as my husband. I joined your name along with mine. But you... ...you destroyed everything. The photograph that was shown to me was a lie. They cheated me and got me married! And you are the root cause of all this! Tell me, why did you do this to me?! Why?! Why?! Why?! Why did you do this to me?! Why are you taking revenge with me?! Now when I want to die, you don't even let me die! Tell me, what is my fault?! What is my fault? Tell me! Answer me! From whom are you asking answers? Who are you asking? He can't answer any of your questions. I think you don't know that he cannot talk. He is dumb. Dumb! Anyway, even though poor people can talk... ...they live like a dumb in the world of rich people. He has been brought up by the king... ...tolerating his beatings and abuses. But he is not involved in the crimes of the king. Whatever happened and whatever is happening... ...Shankar is innocent. He is completely innocent. I... Your Highness... ...today again you drank a lot Yes! Yes! I'm drunk! My friend threw a party to celebrate my marriage... ...and I'm alone over here! No wife! I will! I will make my wife get rid of her ego! My wife... ...my foot! My foot! Bloody fool! Bloody fool! Today I won't allow myself... ...to be dishonoured! I will remain awake and I will awaken someone! Just see! Now... Now... I have washed my face with cold water! See... ...my eyes are open now! Quickly take off your clothes! Your Highness, I am ready! Your Highness! Your Highness! Shankar... ...a thirsty person always comes to well. But today... I have come to you to quench my thirst! Quench my thirst, Shankar! Satiate me! Shankar! I will satiate you. I will, for sure! You? - You are a beautiful girl... ...and I am a wild man. Come on, let's do it! Quench your thirst! Do it! No! No! Save me! No! No one is going to save you! Save me! No! Save me! No! Save me! Shankar! No! No! No! No! No! No. No. No! Shankar! No! Shankar! Shankar! Save me! Shankar. Shankar! You want to hit me, huh? Hit me! You want to hit me? - Hit me! You want to hit me? - Hit me! How dare you touch Brijwa? No! - This is your rightful place! Right under my heels! You are a slave! No! No! Brijwa, no! Don't hurt Shankar! You poked your nose in my matter?! No! Brijwa, no! How dare you? Don't hurt him! Brijwa! Scoundrel! Brijwa, what's wrong? Why are you beating Shankar? Why don't you ask him? He flirts with Bindiya behind your back! Today... ...I have caught both of them red handed! No! No! No! Don't beat him! I had gone to him. It's my mistake. Don't beat him! Scoundrel... ...you betrayed me! You went to my servant!? Now I will satiate your thirst in such a way... ...that you will burn in that anguish for your life! Chanda... ...she is one of our servants... ...whom you can use every night at your brothel! Now she doesn't belong to my palace... ...but to your brothel. Bloody fool! Forgive me, Shankar. I had mistaken you. Dear, husband is a God! It's wife's duty to serve her husband. You have to live for him... ...and die for him! Your whole life is for your husband. Think about your husband and say with me. Come on, say with me. My husband is my God! Try to imagine about your husband! Just your husband! Say it, dear! My husband is my God! It's my duty to obey him! Say it, dear! My husband is my God! Say it, dear! Say it! "On the garland of my breath!" "On the garland of my breath... ...I will take my beloved's name!" "On the garland of my breath... ...I will take my beloved's name!"

You guys have become naughty! What's all this noise? Brother Ashok is back! Brother Ashok is back! Ashok? Listen, Ashok has come! Hey, take it! Dear, are you back? Greetings. - You didn't inform us in any way? Bless you, my dear. We were dying to meet you. We are seeing you after so many days. What did you bring for us from abroad? Where is Gauri? - Sister Gauri has gone away! Gone away? Where? A girl has to get married someday, right? Why? You didn't get the wedding invitation? What? Marriage? You married my sister? Without my without asking me? Where? With whom? Dear, she now lives in a big mansion! I can't describe her happiness. Gauri is really a lucky girl. And he is not only called King! But he really is! - Yes. King? Your brother's letter has come. He is coming to meet you. If you become sentimental and utter... ...a word about our family matter... Then you will see your brother getting... Where is His Highness? - I am here, brother-in-law! You? - Yes. I am your sister Gauri's husband. Yes, brother, he is your brother-in-law. Brother! Brother! Why are you crying? Why didn't you attend my wedding, brother? Gauri! - I wish you had sent me off! Gauri, I got this news only after I returened... ...back here that you've been married. Brother, if you'd have attended my wedding... I would have never complained... Gauri, aren't you happy? No, brother, I am happy! I am really happy. I think I am the luckiest woman of all... ...that is blessed with such happiness! I never thought that... ...I would be so happy! Look around you, brother! Look around you! This mansion! This lavishness! And the respect! Gauri, before coming here I was a little confused myself. But now that you are happy, I am really relieved. Now I can go back happily! Your Highness... ...I will be grateful to you for all my life. You have enlightened the fate of a poor girl! Goodbye. I will leave now. Why don't you have something? Take rest. You have just come. Thank you. But I cannot have meal or even drink water... ...at my younger sister's house, it's against the tradition Yes, yes! Brother is right. Very good! How can I break your tradition? You can go. Be happy. Hey, stop the cart. What is it? What are you saying? I am not getting you. Your sister's marriage is a deceit! Take her away from this place! No! Gauri, I've become crazy by your beauty! Crazy! Today, the beast within me has awakened! I won't let you go today! Come! Gauri... ...your life is ruined like this... And you tolerated this all? Brother, please leave from here! You have no idea, these people are very dangerous! Very dangerous! Your Highness... ...you've oppressed my sister. You have cheated my sister in the name of the marriage! Now my sister won't live in this hell anymore! Gauri, let's go! Brother! Brother! Brother-in-law... ...you will take my wife outside? Bloody fool! This mansion is that cage, where... ...death resides on every door and exits! You have entered the death-trap! Brother! Brother! Brother! Brother! Brother! Brother! Please don't hurt my brother! Back off! Shankar! Shankar! No! No! Brother! Brother! Brother! Shankar! Shankar, I couldn't rescue my sister from here. You... You take away my sister from here. I... I... I give you my sister's responsibility. Shankar... Brother! Shankar! How dare you, scoundrel? Shankar! Guards, catch them! They should not get away! No! Brijwa... ...I want him alive! Go! Brother, the enemy has succumbed to his own death! No, Brijwa, you know nothing about Shankar! I won't believe it unless I see his dead body. I want both of them! Dead or alive! Bloody fool! Did you find Shankar? We searched over the entire river. But we couldn't find him. You didn't make any efforts! Now, watch my efforts! Look, I've made an effort and killed them. Now I will find Shankar and Gauri. Your Highness, I will bring thousands of girls for you! Just forget about her! Forget her! - No! He has run away with my wife! He has broken my heart! It's a throbbing pain. Only their death will lessen this pain! I will search the entire jungle. I will not rest until I get hold of them! D.I.G., did you hear about Shankar's betrayal? Yes, that's why I've come up with these commandoes! They will look for Shankar in the same manner... ...as a hungry wolf hunts for his prey! Brijwa?! These dogs were loyal to Shankar. They would have betrayed us and alerted Shankar. Good brains, blood fool! Guards, follow Birjwa, and find them in the jungle! I will go with D.I.G. and search for them from the sky. Pilot, turn back the helicopter! Turn it back! Brijwa, where are you taking us in this dark forest? Do you think I am cheetah, bear, fox or a monkey? Who am I? If we encounter wild bison, then we will be doomed! Sir? - So you found the bison, huh? These are their foot marks. Sir... ...here is an ear-ring. Walky-talky! Brother! - Yes, Brijwa. Yes. Brother, you've guessed it right. - What? Yes, they are alive. - Really? I've found Gauri's earring and I... ...can see their footmarks! Where are the footmarks leading? Yes, brother! - They are hiding... ...in the rocks near the stream. Cordon off the area! - Yes, brother. Get back near the stream! Get back! We're dead! Did you find them? - No, brother... ...and it's getting dark now. - An afternoon has turned into evening! Where have they gone? Bloody fool. How could this night befall in our search? Bloody fool? Your Highness, have your food! It's getting over! - I won't eat. Your Highness, please have some food. No! It's amazing! Every man lives for food and dies for it too! And His Highness is angry over it! Today we've cooked this food in the jungle. We might not get it tomorrow. Today, we are eating this food. Tomorrow, a beast might eat us. Commando, go and get me water! Quickly! Normal. That's fine. I will go and get it myself. Huh?! Guys, don't walk togather. This is a dark forest! If you somone at the back gets killed... ...those in the front won't even know it... ...that how they suddenly got vanished? Where have you gone? Hey, where are you? Hey, they are hanging! Why are you hanging in there? Come down! Come... They are not coming down! Brijwa! Brijwa! These two are dead! So that becomes three now! This Shankar is proving to be a nuisance! He is somewhere around here! Find him! Find him! Brijwa! Brijwa! Forget about Shankar. Blasted! Blasted! The petrol tank is blasted! What's going on? - This place has become a graveyard. Everyone is dying one by one! That mute is going to leave us deaf, blind... ...cross eyed and handicapped! That scoundrel is using the tricks that he learned from us! Using on us? Well, he is making us wander all over! He is battering us! Doctor, you are telling us bitter truth, but it's true! - Yes. It will be good if we return from here! It means that we should accept our defeat! A defeat by servant? Man, when a tiger becomes a man-eater... ...then even a hunter has to fall back! What nonsense are you talking? If we didn't pay attention to his nonsense... ...then we will become history! And when we are dead, the villagers... ...will tell their children about Shankar's bravery! And then he will be hailed as a hero! And we will be the villains! What do you think, Your Highness? At least you are sensible, right?! Yes, we will go back. "Loneliness! Loneliness!" "It brought us together!" "Loneliness! Loneliness!" "It brought us together!" "We were overwhelmed by the tide of love!" "How did this wave arise?" "Loneliness! Loneliness!" "It brought us together!" "We were overwhelmed by the tide of love!" "How did this wave arise?" "Today the wind played the flute." "And sang our untold feelings of love!" "Today the wind played the flute." "And sang our untold feelings of love!" "My heart is drowned in... ...the depth of your love!" "Loneliness! Loneliness!" "It brought us together!" "We were overwhelmed by the tide of love!" "How did this wave arise?" "I can feel your pain!" "I feel you are close to me." "I can feel your pain!" "I feel you are close to me." "You and only you craved for me!" "I realized this after a long time!" "Loneliness! Loneliness!" "It brought us together!" "We were overwhelmed by the tide of love!" "How did this wave arise?" Shankar! No! Shankar! Shankar! Shankar! Shankar! No! Shankar! Shankar! No! No! No! Don't hurt my Shankar! Don't hurt him! Shankar! What did you say? My Shankar? Then who am I? Scoundrel! Bloody fool! Tolmol, can one stop the storm of love? Not at all! No at all! I will run away with Rasili like Shankar did! Run away! Get away! When His Highness and his guards... ...couldn't stop Shanka, then what can my father do? Hey, there comes my father. My father's face looks like a balloon... ...whose air has been sucked out! Come on, father! Your face looks really gloomy! What is it? You really look annoyed! What is it? Tell me. Son... ...you were right that day! When a young woman is forced to marry... ...with an old man, then the result is disaster! Because younger ones are rebellious. - Yes! So Shankar rebelled, didn't he? And he has run away with Gauri! I wish they escaped! They shouldn't have been caught! Father, what are you saying? Yes!... They both were caught! And they were killed! They were killed? - I've heard this at the mansion. His Highness had them killed! No! Great! Your Highness, you have brought a beautiful girl! Chanda, she is not only beautiful... ...I had cared and nurtured her. But a scoundrel has spoiled her! And I don't keep spoiled things with me! Your Highness, who was that scoundrel... ...who dared to betray you?! There was one such fool! A slave named Shankar! I have sliced his throat and finished him off! But why did you spare her? Well, if I wanted I could've killed her too! But the death would have been a salvation for her! But I want her to die every moment. A slow death! She will ask for the death, but she won't have it! Every drunkard and lowlife of this area... Debauch and characterless... I want every one of them to have fun with her! I want them to ruin her! Bloody fool! Father! Father! Come quick! No, dear! No! Don't you try to get up! Your wound is not healed yet. If you will get up... ...then the neck sutures might loosen. Just lie down like this. Dear... ...your bones have been badly battered! When I brought you here... ...you were hardly alive! Dear... ...you're mute, right? Dear... ...your neck, all... ...your nerves were cut! ...when I was applying stitches to your neck... ...I noticed a nerve which... ...was kind of suppressed! And you had lost your ability to speak due to this! I have opened up that nerve. Now you might be able to speak. Because, you... ...aren't a born mute! You must have met with an accident! What had happened, dear? Father! Father, I have brought food. Hariya! Hariya! - Yes! Your son Shankar has come to call you. - I am coming! Contractor! - Yes. Contractor! Look, what I have found! You can see something shining in the coal. What might it be? Diamonds? - What? Diamonds? Diamonds! Great! Diamonds in the coal mine! Diamonds in the coal mine! I've become rich! I've become rich! Hey, see, I've got diamonds in the coalmine. - Diamonds? When the owners will be back in the evening... ...I will show them the place and diamonds! They will give me reward! And we will be rich! - Really! We will educate our Shankar. We will turn him into a gentleman! No! Mother! Father! Mother! I will go and tell that to everyone! I will tell them that you have murdered my parents! You are murderers! Leave me! What happened then? Inspector... ...who is that cruel fellow? A brute! An animal! Who killed Hariya and his wife! Tell me, who has murdered them? I am a contractor! I am caretaker of these workers! Who made this innocent boy a mute forever... ...by plunging hot coals down his throat? Now he won't be able to speak for his life! But he is not blind yet! He will identify those criminals. I will not let him live! Shankar, dear, tell me, who is it... ...amongst them who has murdered your parents? Go and identify! These two? These two have killed your parents? Inspector, arrest both of them! Get away from here! So you've killed these murderers? - Yes, I have. They were dangerous and wanted criminals. They fired at us. And they were killed in an encounter. Inspector, that's really great! See, Shankar? The law has revenged your parents' murder! I will take care of you! From now on, I will be your guardian! Gauri! Oh great! What a beauty! Great! Chanda, you've hidden the real beauty inside! When a girl comes here... ...then she belongs to you, sir! Chanda, I am ready to give you anything for her! I will spend every dime to just touch her! Stop right there! And don't you dare touch her! What did you say? - Yes! When I came here! No one came to save me! But I am going to save her. She is somebody's true love. She belongs to him. And I am in debt of her beloved! You will have to kill me before touching her! Come on, Gauri! Gauri, you have no idea... ...that you're trapped with the beasts! His Highness has made both of our lives hell! And he has killed your dear Shankar! No! No! He has just called me! Bindiya, I've just heard his voice. He is still alive! He is alive! Gauri, a mute never talks. I know that truth is a bitter thing! But you have to accept it. No! I don't accept it! I will never accept it! My Shankar can't die! God can't be that merciless! He is alive! He is alive! He is alive! He is alive! "Our bodies are separated." "But our hearts are not." "They cannot be separated!" "Because people are not God!" "What's a mountain, compared to love?" "Even the sky bows; love can't be stopped."

So they are our partners in diamond... ...business, that takes care of our business abroad! They are not only partners... ...they are my childhood friends! Welcome! Welcome! - Your Highness! Greetings, Your Highness! Cheers! Today friends have met and they are old! Everybody eat tobacco 'Gopal Gold'! Your Highness, show us the diamonds! Yes, let me show you. Here it is! That's it?! I will mine those diamonds with patience! Otherwise the law might cast an evil eye upon them! Just like you did it last time! Yes, just like that! Like we did it with Hariya! Your Highness, you are simply great! You had murdered Hariya, then with... ...help of D.I.G. you branded us as dead! And then sent us abroad! And you started your diamond business! You are absolutely safe in regard to the law! What? - Because... ...dead bodies are not arrested! And you are sent percent dead! Your Highness, forgive me... I think you have given up... ...romancing as you became old! Your Highness, it seems really lifeless in here! Well, your heart will start singing... ...after I present you with today's arrangement! That's great! - Your Highness... ...she isn't ready to come here! Why? - Because Gauri can't come here! Gauri? - But why? Because Bindiya is proving to be an obstacle! What? Brijwa, did you hear that? How dare she? Your Highness, if someone tries to misbehave... ...with Gauri, then Bindiya just attacks that person! Your Highness... ...is Gauri alive? Though she doesn't exist for us. But I have left... ...her to die a slow death! No! No! Don't oppress Bindiya in such a way! Don't do this! Don't do this! Don't do this! Leave her for God's sake! No! No! I say stop it! No! Don't do this! No! No! No! No! Where are you going? - Back off! No! No! Why are you trying to save her, you silly? She is a disgraced woman! A dishonoured one! She has been maligned! Don't try to protect a dishonoured woman! Just think about yourself! About your own beauty! No! No! Just look at her! She is beauty from heaven! Just look at her! Look at her till your heart contents! It doesn't cost a dime to look at her! Hey, this looks like a stain on this beautiful body! Great! She is so beautiful! Beautiful hair! Gauri! What did I hear? You uttered a word? Dumb... ...you are alive... ...and screaming now! But... ...what's the use of it? You have deceived death once... ...but again you are lying in shadow of death! Brijwa, you don't know... ...what the death wishes! Are you trying to... ...scare an angel of death? I am not scaring you! I am showing you a shadow, of death... ...which is lingering around you! Just see, it's around you! You can back off two or hundred steps! But today, the shadow of death is going to engulf you! This shadow is my death, huh? I will die because of this shadow? This shadow is my death! I will die because of this shadow! This shadow is my death! I will die because of this shadow! This shadow is my death! I will die because of this shadow! I will destroy it! I will ruin it! You couldn't destroy my body even when you tried! So how can you destroy my shadow? You are my death, huh? Come on! Come on! Save me! Shut up! Don't make any moves! Leave me! Give this girl to me! I have bought her! But I've already... ...bought your life! What? Who are you? Try to recall! You people have murdered my mother and... ...my father Hariya Thakur for a few diamonds! Shankar? Yes, Shankar! 20 years ago, I am a revenge sowed by your own mistake. Yes, I am your death! A death?! Then let me strangle you! No! You are not going to die that easily! - No, Shankar! First tell me, who was the third man... ...who had put burning coal in my mouth! Shankar! - Tell me, who is that third man? Tell me! That third man was, His Highness, himself! No, Shankar! No! No, Shankar! Shankar, don't kill me! No! No! Shankar! No, Shankar! No! And that's how I got back my voice. Why are you looking at me like that? Today I just want to keep hearing you! Just keep hearing you. You just want to hear? Aren't you going to tell me about yourself? My pains are erased when I met you! I've forgotten about them! Shankar, let's get away from this place! A place, where there will be no one, except... ...you and me, and our own life! How can I let them live... ...who had killed my own? They have ruined my childhood! They have oppressed my beloved! Who is it?! Who is it?! What... am I seeing?! Dear, wake up! Wake... dear, wake up! Dad, go to sleep! The ghost is wandering near the window... ...and you are asking me to sleep! Where?! - See there! See there! See there! Where's the ghost?! You are scaring your son! You are scaring a little child! You snore so much while sleeping! Why will the ghost come here?! Nonsense! Why are you murmuring?! I want to... Dad... dad, I think this is Shankar's spirit! You escape through the window... ...and I'll escape from the door. - He is standing near the window! We both will escape through the door! Even I am coming! Wait! Wait! Come, dad. Come... - Wait! Is it a ghost... - Is it a spirit?! Is it his soul?! Please forgive us, spirit! I apologize for all my mistakes, ghost! I am not a ghost. - Dad, he is talking. Shankar was dumb. - He is a ghost. Let's leave. See, friend. Look at me. Touch me. Don't touch him! He'll disappear! Dad, he is Shankar! Dad, he is Shankar! Shankar, you are alive, Shankar! Shankar, you are alive! Shankar! How did all this happen? Shankar... ...the king had killed you. I have such a big burden of revenge on me... ...that even the death refused to accept me. Shankar, even I am burdened with sins. I'll help you and lessen that burden. Yes. Now this doctor is with you, Shankar. Wow, dad! Wow! Today I feel like embracing you for the first time, dad! Dad! Who is that enemy who stabbed me on my back?! He burnt my brother in front of everyone! You couldn't inquire about him even though... ...you are a retired D.I.G. of this area! What can I do, Your Highness? Whoever I ask, he says that I don't know who he was! You are talking as if he doesn't live on land... ...but he is from the skies! Your Highness... who... is he? Ranvir! There is an arrow hanging on his neck! Take it, it seems the enemy has sent a massage. I am the one who you are searching for... ...I am responsible for Brijwa's death... ...and I have sent this corpse. But it's so sad that you cannot conduct any... ...legal inquiry, because this man is dead... ...20 years back, according to the law. You must be wondering whose voice this is. This is the voice of your death... ...and this voice won't let you live peacefully now. Every moment, every second... ...it will make you and your henchmen realize... ...how close they are to death. Because I have a feeling of... ...revenge in my heart that will kill all of you. And you all will be killed one after the other. After Ranvir, Dilavar... ...then D.I. G... ...and then the King. He didn't take my name, Your Highness! You all will die! Then what will I do alone, Your Highness?! Doctor, who can this enemy be? Hello. Dilavar, your life is in danger. Danger! Whose danger, Your Highness? Koyla (Coal) is searching for you! Koyla! Who is Koyla? The one who burns and destroys. Your Highness, I can't understand anything! Ranvir is lying in front of me! He is lying? - He is dead! Who killed him? Koyla. - Koyla... Yes! Come to my mansion quickly! Bloody fool! Help! You! He'll kill me! He'll kill me! Who'll kill you? - Koyla! Koyla... - Yes, the one who ...who killed your friend Ranvir! What? - Come on! Hurry up! Not on the right! Take a left! But the king's mansion is this side. He is coming from this side! Take a left! Stop! Stop here! Where have you brought me? This is the coalmine. I never told you that I'm taking you to the diamond-mine. But why have you brought me here? Someone wants to meet you personally. Me! Who wants to meet me? Shankar. - Shankar? Who is Shankar? Haria's son. In whose mouth you people, put a burning piece of coal. Shankar. What?! Keys... give me the keys! Give... I kill You Leave me Dad, who is hanging over there?! He is not hanging, dear... ...but he is swinging! He is enjoying a lot! Dilavar... - Dilavar! Dilavar! - You are right. He is that Dilavar... ...who, 20 years from now... ...murdered Haria... ...and this D.I. G... ...pretended to shoot Dilavar and ended his case. Guards... ...find out who is talking. Workers... ...the one who got Haria and his wife murdered... ...the real murderer is... The king. That's not true! He is lying! In order to capture the diamonds... ...that were found in the coalmine, this... ...scoundrel king... ...killed two innocent people. He is talking all nonsense, people! All nonsense! He is a devil in the form of human being. He is that murderer who kills workers. Who are you?! Why don't you come out?! Shankar! I am the eyewitness of your crimes. My parents were murdered on your orders. And when I wanted to complain against... ...that crime, you put a burning coal... ...in my mouth and I lost my voice. And when these eyes recognized those criminals... ...you and that D.I.G. pretended to kill those... ...murderers and made me and everyone believe you. No! - For 20 years... ...without his voice... ...and without his parents... ...an orphan who was helpless and... ...weak, like a slave... ...like a pet dog... ...kept serving you. I kept on worshipping a devil, considering him as God. But today time... ...has revealed the truth to me. You are my culprit! Wow! Wow! Workers... ...he is the biggest criminal! Being my servant, he took my wife and ran away! He is making a false story to escape... ...from the punishment! Not he... ...but the king is making a false story! I was never his wife! They cheated me and got me married to him! It was all planned! Speak up! - Yes! Yes, this is true... ...that in the greed for money... ...we showed Shankar's photograph to... ...Gauri and made her agree... for the marriage! Tell them, king! Is this true or no?! He won't say anything! Now I'll tell everyone! He didn't only implicate Gauri, but he is also... ...responsible for all the murders and rapes... ...that took place in the village! Today he is caught! Today he is caught! Doctor! - Sorry, brother! Sorry! Dad is not on your side anymore! You king! Previously dad used to make you eat medicines... ...but now he'll make you eat coal! Coal! Kill him! Kill him... - Kill him! Kill him... - Kill him! Bloody fool! Shankar! Bloody fool! No, Shankar! No, Shankar! The fire will be caught because of oil! There is coal all around! It'll catch fire! I have brought you up! To do slavery. I have given you life! To save yourself from death. Look, Shankar... ...according to our religion a person is burnt after death. You can't burn me alive! You started this story... ...by putting a burning coal in my mouth... ...and today this burning coal... ...will become the fire of your death and finish off the story, King. No, Shankar! No, Shankar! I beg of you! No! No! No! No! "Our bodies are separated." "But our hearts are not." "They cannot be separated!" "Because people are not God!" "What's a mountain, compared to love?"
