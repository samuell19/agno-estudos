Conjugal Life "Dear Nicol?s, I have loved you like no other. I have always been yours in body and soul. In exchange I have only received disrespect and low blows. I don't regret that which I'm about to do since God is my witness that I'm not evil. I just hope it won't hurt you too much." I'll be yours forever, until we die of old age. Do you like me? - Do you really like me? - A lot, a lot. Do you like it? - It's wonderful. - You don't like it. You're not mad? Don't worry. I'm going to work a lot, so you'll have a cook... and many maids. And a house with large windows and a garden full of trees for our 10 children to run in. I don't like children. I want you all to myself. "It rained cats and dogs that night. The blackness filtered in through the window. Nevertheless, inside, the light glowed, lighting his profile. She contemplated him with fascination. She realized that from that moment on she would never be lonely again. Gone was her life of loneliness and a past full of tribulations." Sir, look... your poison is no good. Actually they get hungrier. Alicia, please take care of the lady. I'll be right there, ma'am. The thing is you have to feed them plenty of it. Watch. Lime rat... I'll give you this bag for free, and if it doesn't work, come back and I will kill your little rat myself. Thank you. Careful, careful, we have many things to do. Now? For love, there is no time. You're in charge, cousin. There are no rooms available, unless you'd like to wait. Will it take long? It depends. Sometimes it does and sometimes it doesn't. You know, as soon as some leave, others come in. Yeah... ♪ Poor me, my love ♪ ♪ Poor me, don't suffer anymore... ♪ This business is better than restaurants. Yes, apparently so. In the name of the Father... the Holy Spirit... - Congratulations. - Thank you. This is the moment. That dress looks really nice on you. - Thank you. - Really nice. This is a good beginning. Imagine, we begin with all the hotels in Tlalpa. And then we get serious. The largest tourism resort in the country. And me? You? I will build you a little studio so you can write those things you enjoy. Nicol?s. Do you love me? What do you want? Do you find me attractive? Or how do you like your women? Who did you just think of? Nobody. Nobody, honey. “As time passed... she realized she was like a caged bird." Would you quit with this nonsense? It's my novel. Jackie, Jackie... there are more important things in life. Lobo Tourism Shall we go? My regards to your wife. Hello, I'm Jacqueline Castro. Hi. Guess what, Jackie? Sing, you imbecile. Sing. ♪ In a golden cage hanging from a balcony ♪ ♪ A lark sang her sorrow. ♪ "She, an exquisite flower, suddenly found herself tarnished by the boot of a brutal, incontinent and tyrant being. Her injured spirit found solace in the warmth of a note, in the caress of a verse and in the sparkle of wisdom, magnificent balms that cleared the shadow of pain that had befallen her." Jackie, do you feel well? Would you like to lie down for a while? Do you mind if I share a little secret with the engineer? Just a second. Sir, as a special favor for me, don't leave her alone. Look at her state. Perhaps it would be best to take her home. It would be a pleasure. You're a sweetheart. Here is the gentleman, Jackie. I hope you'll feel better. If you'd like, I can escort you to your home. - I love these parties. - Yes. If it were up to me I'd stay here forever. Here, thank you. ...when Nicol?s was my boyfriend. I still remember he used to ask for my permission to make love to me. ...and he thanked me. He's probably with one of his little whores right now. Hey, what are you doing? Get off. Just a second, honey. I'm coming. Nicol?s... Easy. Everything's your fault. What's wrong, honey? You look nervous. Idiot. Calm down, honey. What time did you get home last night? Work ran late and I didn't want to wake you. You don't care about me. You're never here when I need you. You're selfish. You know I'll be waiting here for you. - You don't even know where... - Goodbye. Sir, please. Shit. Sir, you're my idol. Congratulations, sir. Great shot. Here is the project. Alicia... It's a pleasure. As you can see, in addition to the hotel, there will be a big convention center, a golf course, but above all else, tennis courts. Many tennis courts. Mr. De Grazia, my assistant. - It's a pleasure. - It's a pleasure. It's a pleasure. What do you think? What about the land? I like it, I like it, I like it. What a view. Aren't these peasant-owned public lands? We'll build the bungalows here, and the swimming pool here. - And the cultural center? - What? We should bring culture to these small towns. Magdalena, shut up about the things you don't know. Madam, your brother is waiting for you in the living room. - Who? - Your brother Adrian. How many times have I told you not to allow any of my family in here? More so if I'm not at home. If it's money you're after, I don't have any. Really? I bet you can't guess who he is. You give up? He's our cousin... Gaspar. Hello, cousin. Please stay for dinner. Nicol?s will be arriving soon. Do you plan on staying for along time? I don't know. He's about to get a job in order to continue with his studies. - Tell them about Veracruz. - Yes, please... Let him tell us about it. I've been studying there... I mean, working-- So I thought he could be useful to my brother-in-law. Who better than family to turn to in such cases? - Of course. - Isn't that right, Magdalena? It's Jacqueline. Even if you have trouble pronouncing it. Is it Magdalena or Jacqueline? Jacqueline. - How nice. - Yes, yes. Would you like some more meat? Thank you. - Good dinner, huh? - Yes, really good. Delicious. Have you been to Cuernavaca? Cheers. He's an incredible man, Márgara. His voice... he's tall, thin, has honey-colored eyes and sultry eyelashes that oh... ...he's so sweet and caring and attentive... Does he like art? I'm sure... Magda? Magda? Little sister... I've told you not to call me Magda or little sister in front of people. Go to your table. The loan's been taken care of. And the land? They are no longer public domain. Cheers. - Pleasure. - Come with me. This is only the beginning. Imagine, the entire country covered with bungalows and swimming pools, - lots of swimming pools. - How nice. Oh, my wife Magdalena, Mr. Robles and Mr. De Grazia. - It's an honor. - My pleasure. - At your service. - Come, let's start here. - Come on, let's go dance. - No, thank you. They are a bunch of scoundrels. Worthless good-for-nothings. Skirt-chasing imbeciles. On the other hand you're an inexperienced kid, but very sensitive, my love. Márgara, come. Look, I want to introduce you. Márgara is more than a sister. We used to take the same streetcar home. She's the best thing that happened to me in my student years. And you, do you paint or sculpt? No, I work. Excuse us. Jackie... Don't you find him a bit rustic? The thing is he works with Nicol?s. I hope you can keep him away from bad influences. Enjoy yourselves... and work hard. Martincito... ♪ That in the matters of love ♪ ♪ In the matters of love ♪ ♪ In the matters of love ♪ ♪ You can't avoid feelings... ♪ Well, thank you. Goodbye. They're my children. Gasparcito and Clarita. And this one? She was my wife. Did she die? No, I wish. Don't get sad. It's tough when one removes the blindfold for the first time. Forget about it. Come, there are still... more women... in the world. If it were up to me, I'd never see my wife again. Don't worry, Gaspar. I'm all yours from now on. What about your husband? Can you imagine everything we could do if we were together? Yes, but I have no money. A waiter makes more than me and I have an education. Would you kill your wife? Don't give me that look. I couldn't do it either. There are things a spouse can do and others that one can't. Don't get up. I'll be right back. Don't take long. A detective could follow my wife to find out if she's sleeping with someone else. It wouldn't surprise me, I know her type. I could accuse her of adultery and she'd have to grant me a divorce. But with the money I earn... Come, Goleta. What do you think? Smells like the countryside. Wait for me like that until I return. "Since then she decided to turn into a lioness. Into an avenging angel to defend her womanly dignity above everything else." Tomorrow? My husband passes by here every day at 6:00 sharp. Aim at him as soon as you spot his car, and when he's here right in front of you... you shoot him. At least three times to make sure. What if someone sees me? Nobody but my husband comes by here. I will grant the maid the day off to avoid having any witnesses. He leaves early, so come by in the morning for the pistol. - At what time? - Around 9:00. Around 9:00? I don't even have a watch. How will I know what time it is? I have a surprise for you. I was going to give it to you later but... How beautiful. You like it? Yes. You shouldn't have bothered. They've already discovered that my wife isn't seeing anyone. But in order to accuse her of adultery I need to stage it, with a professional. But I need money for that. All we'll have to pay to be together like this... it's nothing. "At the sound of her own words, she was overtaken by a delicious tremor. That night, she would become for once what she hated most in life. After all, isn't it noble to grant a dying man his last wish?" Jackie? They're ringing the bell. They're ringing the bell. God damn it, it's late. What do you want? What do you mean? You said today, right? - Your husband. - Jacqueline, who is it? - I'll get the gun. - I have no more money. - Good morning. - Good morning. What a night. Is that right? Yes, your cousin is better than ever. Check it out. She didn't escape unscathed either. - No? - No, no. - Do you want to sit down? - Sure. - Some juice? - Yes, thank you. What's wrong, honey? Jackie, honey, what's going on? That's not true, honey. Oh, honey, honey. Don't be silly. It's just a picture. R's 'gust a pint-- Honey. You look beautiful. Here. Chocolates. Jacqueline, you're misbehaving. You have to urinate, child. Urinate, my love. There we go. Why is it so expensive? That's what the engineer asked for. One thing is what he asks for and another is what we'll give him. - And if it falls down? - What do you mean? Then it's the engineer's fault. Cut it by half. Work it over with De Grazia. We have to save money. "In spite of the humiliations she suffered, she realized her soul bore no place for cruelty." Madam, your sister is waiting for you. Tell her I'm not here. What do you want? I have a pressure problem. The doctor says that I could die if I become disturbed. You'd better leave. Do you still have fungus in your feet? You're so lucky to have such a good husband. Imagine, after everything that happened, he still was kind enough to take our cousin to work with him. Put your shoes on. I always tell Gaspar, "Boy, wipe those memories away. Pretend that you just met her husband." Magdalena is not bad. You'll see, soon you'll forget the bad times she put you through. I'm talking about the efforts you made to ambush him. It's good you came, sister. I have some used dresses for you. They're not going to look as good on you... Even if I would like to deny it, you're still family. Shut up. You're surprised by my visit, aren't you? My sister was just at my house. Do you know what that snake told me? She gave me a detailed account of your last infidelities. - Jackie. - Don't touch me. I've always respected you. Correct me if I lie. And you take advantage of the fact that I'm sick. Don't raise your voice. The worst of it all is that I've been slandered by that leech. Your accomplice. Do you know what he told my retarded sister? That I was harassing him. Go figure... The truth is that my life is as transparent as water. And that's exactly what you can't stand. You see? You'd like it if I were a lecherous whore like you but you'll never see that. That's why I came to tell you I'm leaving your house. I would have left without saying goodbye, but I wanted to see you face to face. Because I have nothing to be ashamed of. I'll leave before I get a heart attack. Jackie. I'll give you a divorce in advance, if you'd like one. I love you, dummy. How can you doubt that? You are the only woman that counts in my life. Love, don't leave me standing here. If you really want me to return, you'll have to get rid of your accomplice. You're a bit nervous. I think we should take a vacation. Just the two of us. Oh, my love. "They didn't travel together. They traveled one towards the other, to finally find each other, free of hatred and resentment. Happiness doesn't appear effortlessly, it is conquered. Or is it possible for a fire to burn forever without feeding it?" Hello? Jackie. Guess what? Calm down. Where are they? - I want to see them. - Calm down, Jackie, it's not a big deal. Don't you understand? That's what men are like. Good morning, madam. Cheers, my congressman. That is if the party doesn't decide otherwise. Don't worry, the party is with you. You know, if there's someone capable of running my campaign... it's you. Come, I'll introduce you to someone who can donate funds to your campaign. Mrs. Lobato. Sir. Let me to introduce you to our future delegate, Mr. David Carranza. Are you related to Mr. Belusiano? I'm your admirer, madam. Thank you. Would you like to join me? I'm waiting for someone but I've arrived early. What an interesting profile you have. Thank you. A prominent nose, don't you think? Have you ever been asked to pose? What is your professional occupation? Well... I belong to the party-- I consider the state to be a millennial illness that has deprived man the management of his own affairs. No, the institutions-- In the absence of gods we find the need to invent abstractions. Eat. Eat, sir. - What did you think of my friends? - She's frigid, and your little Italian friend is probably a homo. This hotel used to belong to my husband. It's no longer his? He sold it and took almost the entire staff to Las Palmas, in Cuernavaca. Good evening, madam. Actually, your favorite room is available. I love the second floor. Sir. Have a good night. "He is so beautiful, that I feel fulfilled for the first time in my life. I fear his full lips, his thighs, his groin..." "His groin." Can you give me my novel, please? - Your what? - You don't get it. What can you expect from a hardware salesman? Hardware salesman. But you live pretty well. I'm not an object you can use whenever you please. You're a great man. From here to the senate, and then governor, and then, imagine, you, the first lady. If you could only see yourself the way I do. I want to accompany you to the vast stages that destiny has reserved for you. Sir, we would like to inform you that the party has decided to lend its support to Mr. De Grazia's campaign. We count on your support. Congratulations, brother. You know, I count on your collaboration, as my personal secretary. You can count on me. JOYOUS WELCOME Don't get like that. De Grazia is a kiss-ass. That's why they chose him over me. You have a lot of talent. What you need is money. Yeah? Where am I going to get it from? Nicol?s has more than enough. Do you know how to shoot? We're just going to commit an act of justice. An expropriation. Only communists do those things. I can't kill your husband. David, we have to do it. Trust me. But De Grazia can. Your Honorable Congress... Gentleman, allow me a few words. I need to take a leak. They're drunk. Do you remember Luis? - Which Luis? - Remember Rafael...? Remember Luis? You jump the fence and here's the door. I'll give you the key. You climb the stairs and down to the left... the bedroom. Are there any dogs? David, it has to happen tomorrow, before Nicol?s leaves on his trip. What's your bedroom like? You'll see soon enough. Help. I never imagined you to be so fearless, my love. Except that you made a mistake. It was me you gave the blow to, and you let the other guy split. Together forever. Until we die of old age. I'm sorry. Tourism Director Resigns Manuel de Grazia was detained, accused of attempted homicide. What do we do now? No, my friend, what I like is scuba diving. The future of the country is in the coasts. Watch. We have beaches that look like fifteen year-olds, completely virgin. From here to here, you'll have all the support you want. Miss, the next person please. Have a good day. I'm not going to give up just because of some guy who imagines he's deflowering a fifteen-year-old every time he gets in the water. That must feel great. He'll find out just who Nicol?s Lobato is. I don't need a loan from anybody. We'll mortgage everything, even the house. - We'll sell later. - Nicol?s, that is a fraud. If we do it well they won't notice for at least 15 years. And then we'll take it from there. The properties are under your wife's name. She won't even notice. Let's go. Hurry UP- Hurry UP- Hurry up, Magdalena. Do you like it? You look good. You look like a piñata. It's the inauguration of Las Palmas, not a costume party. I wish an earthquake would destroy everything. Look, change your dress. I'll be late. I'm not going, I'm not feeling well. I think my pressure has gone up. All right... when it comes down you can catch up with me. We'll see who entertains your friends. Aren't you going to wait for me? Thank you, God. I can now die in peace. Don't even think about it. You probably have so much to give, to teach. You seem so intelligent. You're so sensitive. Thank you. I've heard that you're writing a novel. They're simply notes, a long story of an impossible love. It sounds very interesting. Love is my favorite subject. Good morning. How did you sleep? Good, sir. Thank you. That's good. The coffee is cold. I'll heat it up for you, madam. You'd make a nice couple. Magdalena, please. Bastard, you're fucking her. Watch your language, Mrs. Grumpy. Aurelia, you don't need to reheat the coffee for the lady. Nicol?s? Aurelia? Nicol?s, are you there? - Nicol?s, please open up. - I'm busy, damn it. Open up. Later. You're going to break the door. So you have something to do when you're not so busy. I can't. Well? It's unbearable. In the evening I feel a hand that draws me inward. Everyday I dream that I will die doctor. Every day, no exceptions. My headache begins like a little black dot that grows and grows until I don't even know where I am. Oh, doctor, he's not the only one hurting. I have been hurt as well. But this is nothing compared to the heartache I suffer. I can't. Don't worry. Love is above all else. What would I give to see you healthy. Imagine if both of us could rest in a clinic... in the Himalayan Mountains. But mountains are good for tuberculosis, and I'm suffering from... stress. It isn't fair that my husband is as healthy as an ox... and we're not... Imagine being at the height of your life... and yet you cannot be happy because you're chained to a man who is killing your soul, little by little. I'd kill him. What did you say? It is not a crime to kill for one's freedom, it's to become God just once in life. How would you kill my husband? I would throw him off a cliff. I'd start by sneaking in his car, without him noticing. And when he least expects it... I would smash his head. What would you do with the body? I would cut him to little pieces and spread him all over the ravine for the vultures to eat him. What are you doing here? Let go of her. Where did you come from? What are you doing here with this old fart? Move. Whore. Let go of her. Let's go. And you, let's see where you'll sleep. Let's go. Girl, bring over a towel. Should we kill him? Hello? Transfer the call. Hello? Hi, Nicol?s? I bet you can't guess where I'm calling from. What, they haven't paid you a visit yet? What? De Grazia is already out. He talked. Let's see if you guys take the leap. Son of a bitch, he left me on my own. "After having postponed her vocation for justice for such along time, the moment finally arrived for her to stop the monster before he ended up suffocating her." What are you doing here? Forgive me. They gave you the boot so soon? Nothing happened, I swear. I thought you didn't care about me anymore. You're also a liar besides being a whore? No, don't touch me. No, don't touch me, I don't want to be rude. Let go of me. Jackie, let go of me. Let go of me, please. - Freeze. - Who are you? - Where is he? - What do you want? Stay still. Where is he? Guess. Come on. Where is he? - In Cuernavaca. - No, he never got there. - Where did he hide? - I don't know. - Where is he? - I don't know. I swear that I don't know. Are you sure? Well, we're not leaving until your husband shows up. I didn't hurt him, sir. I swear. Who said you hurt him? How could I hurt him if I love him? God damn it, where did you put him? I don't know where he is, sir. I swear. Your wife was worried about you. That is not Nicol?s Lobato. It wasn't me. No, don't even think about it. - I've never cheated on my husband. - Not even a little? I'm a loyal woman by nature. Sir, they've already found the car. - And? - He won't be coming anymore. Please tell me what happened to my husband. Take her, and the other guy as well. Whore, degenerate whore. Only my mother was a saint. But compared to the Virgin Mary... Whore. Whore. Whore. Unit 04 communicating with Unit 05. We're before a '42 with the news that no body has been found inside. Radio out. Come on. Walk. Come on. Now, repeat what you said on the way here. - She killed her husband. - Me? - You crazy degenerate murderer. - You're the murderer. - When did I kill him? - Remember. You said, "Let's kill my husband because he has a lot of money. Let's kill him with his own pistol." Lies. If you're so brave, tell these men that you did it. - Go on, tell them. - It was you. You said we'd throw him off a cliff and cut him into little pieces so that the vultures would leave no trace of him. I said it as a joke, but you took it seriously. You hated him because he knew how to make love to me. Damn whore. Asshole. Son of a bitch. That's enough. Enough. We'd been searching for your husband to put him in jail because he scammed half the population. And look what happened. You probably cut him up and threw him far away. That's it, no more fighting. While you work this out, get on your knees and search for the pieces in the ravine. Crazy, impotent fag. Fag. Fag. - Whore. - Fag. Degenerate. - Whore. - Fag, fag. Whore. Fag. THE HYENA ACCUSES THE JACKAL THE JACKAL ACCUSES THE HYENA NO BODY TO BE FOUND I don't know how you can show your face after what you did. Come on, say something. I brought you some used dresses. Let's see how they fit you. One thing's for sure, forget about your family. "'It is difficult to love,' she thought when she opened her eyes and realized she was alone in that huge room. She wanted to think of something but..." I also killed my husband. I turned him into mincemeat. I loved him so much. He had such a pretty, pretty face, like an angel's. That's why I killed him. "After a long time, possibly centuries, after being in that bottomless tomb, she felt how the last of her bones, perhaps her little finger, disintegrated into the dust of eternity." Jacqueline. You're leaving us. Your husband has turned up. They say he is in Veracruz. This one's better? How much is it? That one's... 4,500. Look at what I'm going to show you. Do it. - This is yours. - Thank you. You're welcome. How can I help you? Jackie. Jackie. Look what you've done to me. What have I done to deserve this from you? In my heart, I always knew you were alive. Jackie. It's all over, love. Understand me. I had to stage my death... because they were going to throw me in jail. Everything would have been fine... if it wasn't for you. My angel. Are you sure you don't want me to stay with you? Leave soon so that you can return early. "She started to savor the honey that is vengeance. She anxiously awaited the moment of his death. A slow cruel death like torture she'd fallen victim to during so many, many years. The poison would dry him up little by little. Those eyes, those eyes that I had loved so much would begin to lose their twinkle under the indescribable pain. The executioner will finally feel the sharp edge of the guillotine. For once, the roles would switch. She would finally have triumphed. Did you think that I had forgotten that today is our 40th anniversary? Jackie. It's delicious. Aren't you eating? I want to lose weight and look the way I did when we first met. You remember? What's wrong? I love you. Me too. I didn't forget about our anniversary either. I'll bring you the dessert. No. Yes, you have to try it. Don't disappoint me, it's your favorite dessert. It's good. Come on. A little taste. I made it especially for you. A little more. I think... I ate-- I ate too much. Nicol?s? Lord, do not separate in Heaven those who were so united on Earth Nicol?s Lobato died at 70 years of age. Three days later, his wife Jacqueline died of sorrow.
