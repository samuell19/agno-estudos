We were best friends, the five of us. Ale, Jago, Lukman, Sadat and me, Jarot. Everyday we spent time together. We hung out, joked around, got into trouble, got into fights. Those were the usual activities. Rulers, oh, rulers... Just punch him. He's a mute. Hey, let's continue. Sorry, Dude. My bad. Hey! What's wrong with you? You think you own this street? If I recall, it is my grandma's. Come here you! Hey, come here! Come here! Stop! Hey! Bastard! Come and get me! Hey! Come at me! Move! Hey, hello! Where is he? What's taking him so long? Stop drinking! Give me that! Here drink some more. Excuse me, ma'am! Assalamualaikum. Walaikumsalam. Enjoying the afternoon? That's right. It has been a while, Jarot. Well, I've been around. - Have a seat. - Please sit. Sit down, join us for lunch. Please, don't trouble yourself. I'll have whatever is on the table. How is your mother? She's fine, thank you. That's good. Where the hell is he? If you don't want to die here, you'd better leave. Hurry. Hey, mute-boy! Don't go! Where have you been? I haven't seen you lately. Really? Why don't you come to my house instead? I have to go. Thank's for the food. Bye! Walaikumsalam. Don't run! Bastard! Stop! Hey! Stop! We learnt that friendship meant loyalty. Where have you been? We took care of each other, we supported each other... and we protected each other. It didn't matter if it was right or wrong. We lived our lives dangerously. Tested our nerves to the limit. You fool! - Bastards! - Look behind you! Fools! Go! Let's leave! We lived our lives dangerously. Tested our nerves to the limit. We basically thought with our brawn than our brains. Because in our world, muscles meant power. And power meant honor. POLICE Cops! Police! Stop! Stop running! Hey, wait for me! Hold up! Don't run! Police! Run! Run away! Stop! Stop! Yo, hey.

You dropped your handkerchief. Thank you. Wow! Cool. Have you guys found suits that fit you? - Found a coat? - Not yet. I'm confused. Jago, where's my dad's coat? It's in the back. Just look for it. Yo, what did you to my shirt? You always borrow stuff. Buy your own for once. Is this right? Is it on okay? I can't tie it. Ale. Don't embarrass me. So guys, are we ready? Ale, are you sure about this? Just trust me. Cool. When we become rich, this picture will be a reminder of where we came from. Five street boys who will rule the world! Best friends till the end!

You better watch out! Does it still hurt? No. It's nothing, really. Hey, Aisya! Who told you to come here? This is not a place for you! Go home! Drink this. Aw, sweet sister... Yeah, can we get that kind of treatment too? Stupid! Wipe that smile. Pass me one. Here. Yani, my shoulders hurt, will you massage them? Yani. Ale! Hey, don't do that! Playing rough, I see! Shut your mouth! Goal! - Let's go. - Come, let's get out of here. Ale! What are you doing? Run! Don't ever set foot in this house again! Jarot... Why did you do that? Move. Quick. Come on. Welcome to hell. If you want to live, follow the rules. And I am the rule! Shit! Scoundrel! Don't turn your back when I'm talking to you, asshole! Don't try to be tough here! Beat him! A bastard never eats from a plate. Bastard! - What's up, Mr. Jaya? - Here's the money. - If anyone messes with you, let me know. - Yes. The only problem are some dirty cops, inspecting our inventory they said. But basically, they just want our money. - I'll take care of that. - Thank you, Ale. Hang on. - Laras, where are the groceries? - Just a moment. Just put them with the rest. Die, you bastard! Bastard. Bastard! You want to fight me? Go to hell! Just slither away. Trying to be a tough guy, eh? Bastard. Take this! Let's go! Do you want to fool me? This is my street! I am the owner of this street. If I find you back-stabbing me again... your fate will be the same as those thugs you hired! Liem, the money. Okay... Okay, please forgive me. Liem, give him the money! Are we cool now? A dog must learn to obey its master. Lift him up. - Bastard! - Shut up! You talk too much, bastard! Talk too much. Asshat! Asshat! Let me go! I'm begging you, kill me now. I'd rather die, you bastards! Die! Now you may die! Asshat! - Assalamualaikum. - Wa'alaikumsalam. Mom! - Wash this. - Yes, mother. - How's school? - Fine. - Does anyone mess with you? - Nope. If they do, just let me know. Okay. Bara. A real man always takes care of his family. You must protect your family whatever it takes. Get it? - Yes. - Now, that's my brother. Thank you. What's this? FLUENT IN BAHASA INDONESIA I found it under the wardrobe. Now, can you do push ups? Bastard. Scoundrel! Do you want to get involved? Anybody else wants to be like him? I'll kill you one by one. From now on, you know who's in charge here. All dogs must obey their master! Understood? - You talk too much! - You lost. Finish it! Eat it. Remember that rotting flower? Don't tell anyone. How dare they, selling their stuff here! Freeze, asshole! Hey, chicken, stop running! We should put more guards here. Since the Black Dragon took over that neighborhood drugs are out of control. Yeah. We should recruit more men. I don't care how strong they become. As long as they don't mess with my street. Bastard! KEEP CLEAN Bastard! What do you want? I have a toy for a dog like you. Go to hell! Traitor! Let me go! Look at your master, when he's talking to you! - Look! - You bastard! What are you doing? What are you guys doing? In our brotherhood, honesty and loyalty are the most important things! - Understand? - Yes. If anybody disobeys or betrays us, you will pay with your life! What are you doing here? You want to join our brotherhood? Hey, Fathir? What can we expect from you? You can't even talk! You can't help us, you'd be a burden to us instead. This is a place for real men. Hey, mute! Go home, take good care of your grandmother, okay? Waalaikumsalam! What the hell are you doing? Jarot. Jarot, how do you feel on your first day of freedom? Sit. As you can see, we are one big happy family... and we guarantee the livelihood of our members. For example, Fathir. People used to treat him like he was nothing. But since he joined us, no one dared to do that again. Unless they want to see their limbs mutilated. The same goes for you. You've been betrayed by people you cared the most about... so you belong with us. Prove to them who you really are. We know your reputation. We've been monitoring you since your time in jail. You are needed here. Well? Welcome to your new family. Welcome to the Black Dragon family. Let's make a toast to our new son. Let's go. You know this street belongs to The Black Dragon Gang? Do you want to be squashed like a cockroach? Bag him up. Lex, that's enough. Let them go. No. That's enough. This is not their first time. We must show them who we are. I said, enough! The rule is plain and simple, if you try to sell... in the Black Dragon street, you die! I can't talk much right now. Give me your number. I'll call you telling where and when we can talk. Why don't you come home? Listen, Aisya, you have to keep our meeting a secret. Please, Aisya, just do what I say. Okay, but promise me we'll see each other again. I will. I'll call you. Take care of yourself. I have to go. Your turn to shuffle. Your turn to shuffle. - What? - Jarot has been released from jail. That's good news. Our team is back. But now he's with the Black Dragon gang. He's our enemy now, just like Fathir. That mute scoundrel! So what should we do? Come here, you! How long have you been with us? How many years? And you still don't know what to do? You know how we feel about them! They're our enemy! Their lives mean nothing to us. I was afraid you wouldn't come. I said I'd come. - How are you? - Can't complain. I'd like to apologize. When you were in prison... I didn't visit you. Please understand... Let's not talk about that. Let's just forget about it. And you, how are you? Do you still carry handkerchiefs? No, I stopped. It's embarrassing. Boyfriend? What are you talking about? Jarot, why don't you come home? I will. I'm waiting for the right moment. But why? Do you still have grudges? I had a great time tonight. I have to go. I don't want my brother to get suspicious. I'll call you. We'll see each other again. - Promise? - Yes. Aisya! Aisya, please take care of yourself. - Happy birthday, Mom. - Thank you, dear. You didn't have to throw a big party for an old woman like me. - Jarot. - Boss. Hey, this is a party! - Don't just sit in the corner. - Yes. You did a good job. I'm proud of you. Thank you, Boss. But we have some problems. Ale and his gang are a hindrance to our business in their street. I want you to handle it. If anybody knows them any better, it's you. Can you handle it? Okay? Come on, let's drink to that. Okay, everyone. Move closer! Stand closer, and don't forget to smile. Jarot! Wow. Cool car! Is it new? You've grown. When will you invite us to your parties? Party? Soon. I have some good stuff for you. Free. But remember. If you need more, you know whom to call. - Okay. - Understand? Guys, let's party. Now, let's party! Party. Jarot, sit with me here. Good evening, Boss. I hope you enjoyed our show tonight. Yes, very much. Especially that pretty girl with the golden voice. Sit down. Sorry. If you need anything else, just let me know. I'm very pleased you sang my favorite song. Will you keep me company tonight? Yani, wait! I want to talk to you. What are you doing in this place? This is a dangerous place for you. Can't you see? A good girl like you should not work in a bar. Let me go! Listen to me! I don't want to see you in this place again! - You're humiliating your family! - Humiliate? Where have you been all this time? Where? Do you know who provides for our family? Do you know who's paying for Dad's medications? Do you know? You think I don't know what you do? Your job is no better than mine! Is that why you never come home? You don't care for us anymore! Yani! Yelu! Stand up! Stand straight! The Black Dragon is getting crazier. My brother has become their victim. We can't just sit around. Hey! Where did you get the drugs? Answer me! Where did you get them? From a friend of mine. Give me their names! I want names! He's my friend! Easy. He's your brother, for Gods sake! Shut up! It's none of your business! Jago! Let Lukman deal with him alone. I'll ask you one last time. Who gave you the drugs? Jarot! That scoundrel! Be careful. You don't want to break them. Tell the boss I said thanks. I want you to do me a favor. Anything for the boss. It's not for him, it's for me. You know the girl, Yani. Yeah. I want you to take good care of her. Don't let anybody touch her or take advantage of her. Get it? Yani? Any man would fall for her. She's an asset to the club. Everybody wants her. I'm sorry, man. You... I'm serious. If anything happens to her... I'll burn down your club, with you inside. Are we clear? What is it? I want to see my family. I've been saving some money for them. Don't do it. Why not? I thought you wanted me to go home. It's too dangerous for you. Everybody is looking for you. But I want to see my father. He's sick, you know. No, Jarot! Not now. Don't worry. I'll be fine. Shit, that's Jarot! And Fathir! Get off! - Get off! - Quick! Quick! Stop! Hey, asshole! Pull over! Jarot, stop! What are you doing? Lower your gun! Don't shoot! No! Don't shoot them, Fathir! What are you doing? Lower your gun! Put the gun down! They're your friends, you dumbass! Hey! From now on, we have to watch our street round the clock! I want men at every entrance! I know Jarot will visit his family any day soon. We can't just let them walk all over us! We have to do something! Let's pay them a visit! No! They're too strong for us. We have to make a plan, but we are going to do something. Mom? What happened? Jarot, where have you been, son? What took you so long? I missed you so much. I missed you too, Mom. I always did. Have you eaten? Let's have dinner together, like old times. Yes, I'd love to. But I want to see Dad first. Dad. Dad, it's me, Jarot. What do you want? I'm home, Dad. This is no longer your home! You'd better leave this place. Dad, please forgive me. Get out! Get out. Get out. Look out for Jarot. Don't let him get away. All right! Hey, who's that? Jo, did you see Sidi and Panca? You should watch this spot, not sleep. Please, use this money for food and for Dad's medications. Where are you going? Please don't go, son. Stay with us. Jarot, you must leave, now. They're coming for you. Are you sure you saw Jarot go in? Watch this place. Mother, I have to leave. I'll come back. Jarot, leave, now! Take good care of them, will you? You have to leave. - Come out, Jarot! - Quick. Jarot. Get out! Jarot ran away! Somebody saw him running south. Shit! Let's go! We've been had! Don't run! Stop! Show yourself! Jarot! Don't run! That's Jarot! Stop the car! Stop! Get out! Open the door! Open! - Open it! - Okay, okay! Try over there! Did you see a man running here? - Go! - Hurry up! Hurry! I don't need your help! I'm not a child! Get it? How did you know I was there? Were you following me? Whose blood is this? Who did you kill? This is my own business. And you shouldn't meddle. I don't want any more deaths! Business? What business? Yours? This has nothing to do with the business or the Black Dragon! Listen! I just wanted to see my family! You can't just go around killing people, you idiot! Come on, Man. You don't want to see this. I want to see! You'd better listen to Jago. Come on, Man. Move! I said move, all of you! Brother. What are you looking at? - Leave me alone! Leave! - Leave! Hold up. Fathir! Fathir, let him go! Darn it, mute! You scoundrel! Take it easy, Man! You killed my little brother! What are you talking about? I never thought you could destroy your own friend's life. Murder your own brother. What do you mean? Man, focus. You're drunk... You must pay for it! An eye for an eye! I didn't kill your brother! I paid for his tuition so he could have a better life. But... And now it's all a waste because of you! Easy, Man. You have to die. Die, you bastard. Wake up, Man. Lukman, please. Hang in there. Wake up, Man! Wake up, Man. Wake up, Man. Bastard! Why did you have to kill him? He's Lukman! Our friend! Why did you kill him, you animal! Don't you have a heart? I don't need your protection! I can take care of myself! He wasn't our enemy. He was our best friend. Shit! Open! We have to do something! Let's teach them a lesson! Yeah. How are you doing, Yani? It's been a while. Remember when you massaged me during the soccer game? What will you have? Nothing, we're not here to drink. That's right. We're here for a massage from you. What are you talking about? I'm just an escort, not a prostitute. - Really? That's too bad... - What are you doing? Please, don't hurt me. Let me go. - Silence. - I'm begging you, let me go. Quiet! Jago, Sadat, we're friends, remember? You used to be nice to me. Please let me go. Tell that to your brother. Let go! Bastards. That's not revenge! We were not raised to hurt women! Cowards. Get out of my face! Leave! Answer me! Who raped Yani? Answer me! I swear, I don't know. I swear, I don't know. I don't know them. That's not the answer I'm looking for, you dog! Give me their names. I'm not lying! Names! - They're... - Louder! They're... They're from Ale's gang. Sadat and Jago. Please, don't hurt me. Please. What are you doing? What the hell are you doing? I'm dizzy. Help! Remove their masks. Jarot, please forgive us. I swear, we're very sorry... Jarot! Please don't kill us, Jarot. We're friends, remember? Forgive us, Jarot. We're brothers, remember? Please, don't kill us, Jarot. You're my best friend. Best friend? Best friends? Did you just say we're best friends? Do best friends kill each other? Please, forgive me, Rot. And you. You have the nerve to call us brothers? After you raped my sister? Is that what a "brother" means to you? - Is that it? - We're very sorry. I'm begging you... Please, don't do this. Forgive us, Jarot! Have mercy! Please, forgive us. Please don't! Have mercy! Please, let us go. Jarot! Please forgive us! Jarot, let us go! She's been like this every day. What is happening, Jarot? Why did it have to be Yani? Leave this house! You're nothing but disaster! Out! Honey... Who else will you sacrifice? You don't belong in this house any more! Darn it. I'm going out tonight. Looking for this? How long have you been seeing that scoundrel? Huh? Please, I'm so sorry... How dare you betray your own family for a shit like him? But I love him. Ale, stop! She's your sister! How dare you! He's a murderer! Can't you see, he murdered his own friends! What is so different between all of you and Jarot? Shut up! If you take his side, you're betraying your own family! Betraying our family for what? Shut up! You are not allowed to see him again, ever! Go in! Let go of me! I'm begging you! Don't lock me up! I will kill him with my own hands. Please don't hurt Jarot. I'm begging you. Please, don't hurt him! Don't hurt Jarot! Please don't! Don't hurt him. Don't hurt Jarot! Don't hurt Jarot! Look after Aisya. Get off, hurry! Spread out! Spread out. - Where's Jarot? - I don't know. - He won't answer the phone. - Try again. - Where is he? - I don't know. Where is he? Find him and bring him to me! Find him. Open the door! - Look over there. - Okay. Open the door! Open the door. Get out. Shut up! Get out! Get out! Lex, that's him! You must find him! Open! Out! Second floor. Shut up. - Come on out. - Search the one at the end. Open! What are you doing in my room? Get out! Shut up! Is he here? Nope. Alex? Jarot, Ale and his men are in the motel looking for you. Get out of your room, hurry! Get out, now! Jarot! Come down here! Freeze! Jarot! Shit! Leave! Get in! You drive! Wait! Shit! Shit! You know, if it were not for us, you'd be dead by now. You put our family in danger by seeing Ale's sister! Use your head. Do you think Ale will let his sister to see you again? He might use her against you! - That's impossible! - Why not? - Why not? - Watch your mouth! Let me go, Lex. Impossible, Tir. Aisya will never do that to me! You know her. We love each other. No, I will not leave Aisya! Then you put her life in danger! Think twice, for God's sake! If you love Aisya, leave her. Her life is in your hands. - Happy birthday, Jarot! - Thanks for the pizza. Pizza? I didn't order any pizza. Darn it! Darn it! Bastards! Shit! This is an intolerable insult! You can't even handle douche bags like them! Do what you have to do! I have to go to the rest room. Don't take too long. A gift from Boss Ale. Clean all the mess you made. You see that? It should've been you! It should've been you! Bastard! Answer me! It should've been you! Look at me! Look at me! You're defending him? Him? Let me go, Mom. Let me go, Mom. You have to let me go, Mom. For the sake of our unborn child. I'm so sorry, Mother. Please forgive me. You may leave. But you know that you can never return, don't you? Mother! Take me away now. Away? Where? Anywhere, as long as we're together. We can get married now. I don't want to lose you again. Aisya... It's better that we don't see each other again. But why? For both of our sakes. For our sakes? Or for yours? It's safer for you. After all we've been through, and you just quit? Go home, Aisya. For the sake of your life. I only have you! For God's sake, Aisya, go home! Somebody help! Wake up! Wake up, Aisya! Honey, please... Wake up, Aisya! Honey, please... Wake up, my love, wake up! Wake up, my love, wake up! Wake up, my love, wake up! Wake up, my love, wake up! Wake up, my love, wake up! Officer? There's a woman's body in a deserted building... on Pinang Raya Street. Hurry, Officer! Find Aisya's murderer. Who ever he is, he has to die too. This has to be stopped. This has to stop. No more killing! And from now on, we'll make peace with them, honor their right to their street. And leave them alone. Listen carefully! From now on, I make the decisions. And this is my decision! We have to end this war! And from now on, if you ever disobey me again, I'll be more than willing to kill you. Hello? Ale? How dare you call me. I want to talk to you in person. Just you and me. Forgive me, Mother. Where are you going? Promise me, you'll take care of mom. A real man should fight for his family's honor. Do you remember when we used to bring trouble to the neighborhood? We used to think that we were tough, invincible. We dreamt of conquering the world. We did them all for our friendship, we even called ourselves brothers. That was before you ruined it. Me? If you were my brother, where were you when I was in prison? Where the hell were all of you? My brothers? So you killed them all for revenge? It was not my intention for them to get killed. But it was all of you who wanted me dead. What did I do wrong to all of you, Ale? I loved you all like my own flesh and blood. But you stabbed me in the back. Do you know how I felt? Do you know how I felt when you choose Black Dragon over us? Do you? I know that we're now on opposing sides. But let's make peace. From now on, we're at peace. Simply, just like that? After you murdered your friends? And Aisya? I didn't kill Aisya! I loved her! Love? What do you know about love? You're a murderer! Scoundrel! I swear to God, I loved Aisya! She's dead because of you! We're no longer friends or brothers. She died with your unborn child! Aisya was pregnant? You have to die too, Rot! Ale...! Ale...! Wake up, Le! Ale! Please, stay with me! I'm sorry... You know... I... Always wanted us... to be together again. The five of us, like before. Me, you, Lukman, Sadat, Jago... I wish we could go back to that time. Rot, Rot, Forgive me, Rot. Ale... Again! When we become rich, this picture will be a reminder of where we came from. Five street boys who will rule the world! Best friends till the end! In this world, there will always be good and evil. The good won't always win the battle. And the evil won't always lose. We are our own worst enemy. People would always seek revenge, and pay with their blood. That war will never end.
