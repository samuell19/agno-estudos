I like it. I'll probably take it. Don't you want to see another one? - No need to. - Let me show it to you. Lucie! - A call! - Coming. Two minutes. It's Lucien. Hello. How is it going? Good, I made 350 Frs. I dropped my prices quite a bit. No need to. I'll ask Prudence to walk me home. - Here she is. - Lucie! Fine. Okay. Me too. See you. Good bye. Hello mademoiselle, I'd like to offer a swim suit to my wife. - Sorry. I'm closed. - May I offer you a drink? - No, no time. Good bye. - It's a pity. How are you, beauty? - And you? - Fine. I'm just a little late now. - Did it work fine? - Yes, I made 350 Frs. Hm. Just a little lower. That's really good. Hello. Paul? Yes. Drop by. Here's my new address. 12, Rue des Petits Flots. Okay. See you soon. - Paul's gonna drop by. - Wait, don't move. What's the matter? You have a new beauty spot. - Impossible, they don't grow so fast. - They do, believe me. Some beauty spots appear during your life. Have a look! This one appeared only 3 months ago. Let me see. - You hadn't noticed? - Erm, I hadn't. Wait, you didn't let me watch. - No, I have to get changed. - Oh, please. - Anyway we haven't the time. - How come! - We have to meet the neighbours. - I don't know what to say. Just present yourself, answer the questions and.. Be yourself. Have you been together a long time? Well, For 9 years.. Well, almost 9 years. That's passion then! Well.. yes. Erm, yes, Madame. What kind of occupation do you have? A bit of work in the fashion business. At the moment I'm selling swim suits on the beach. That's good. You're wearing a very pretty dress by the way. She made it. If you're interested in the pattern, I'll sew you a made-to-measure one. No thanks. You'll probably get a special price. - You'll have it. - That's kind of you. And you, what's your occupation? I just took an exam to become a gendarme. I'll have the results in two days. Good. We need people like you, don't we? - Yes. - And we'll feel secure in the quarter. Lucien! I'm coming. I'm sorry. I have a meeting. I .. - Please, go. - Thank you, Madame. Thank you, sir. Well, fine. It seems to be my size. - I don't know how to thank you. - Give me a kiss. It didn't cause problems for you to get it? No, I told them my uniform had shrunk after washing. And they gave me another one. On the other hand, I really must warn you. By no means wear it in public before you get your exam results. I got it. I got it. And what do you intend to do with it? Nothing special. Just like that, to wear it at home, get used to it, to feel implicated. That's fun. In any case, it fits you perfectly. Hi Lucie! - Hi Paul. - Hi. Turn round please. Oh, the uniform fits you just fine! - Really? - Oh yes. Oh, I have a great idea. Let's go downtown and take photos with the traffic. It'd be funny, wouldn't it? In fact that's not really possible. 'Cause, you know, wearing it before the exam results, I'm an outlaw. You mean, I've just kissed an outlaw. - Erm, yes.. didn't she, Paul? - Erm. That's not an unpleasant sensation. I beg your pardon but you must queue like everybody else. Actually, I'm home. I mean, at my father's home. Oh, I'm sorry. Go on. Well. - Thank you, Miss. - Thanks to you. - Good bye. - Good bye. - Good morning dad. - Ah, Lucien! How are you? Sit down. - Your cheque is ready. - Thanks, dad. What's happening here, why all these girls? I've decided to hire a full-time cleaning lady. - Dad, you already have one! - Don't worry, I'm keeping her. Do you know this book? - No, dad. - It's a gift. Do you know, for example, that half of French patrimony belongs only to 5% of the population? No, dad. Do you know that with the 200 biggest fortunes in the world half of the planet population could live? No, dad. Well, give it back to me. You're too young. I don't want you to have dark thoughts. So? What are you telling me? I'll show you. The uniform. Oh, certainly not. Put it away at once. If you knew what an embarrassing situation I'm in when my friends ask me what you're doing? You've chosen a hard job for a father?! Dad, it's just an ordinary profession. That's precisely why you could have chosen another one. An ordinary one. Life guard, steward, artist or model, for example. It's a beautiful job, model. I'd have loved you being a model. I'd have loved it too, but one has to be handsome to be a model. But you are, Lucien. You are! Choose a profession that will enable you to fulfill your potential. I'm not saying that because I'm studying psychology. But to wake up with fits of laughter every night is abnormal. You think so? Do you remember something, a dream or some part of it that comes back regularly? Do you remember Bernard Six? - He was with us the final year. - Of course I do! All girls were crazy about him. He even became a model. - Really? - He did. Strange, I can't remember I found him handsome. So, what about that dream? I'm dreaming.. That I'm having a talk with him. When suddenly, without logic, he sticks out his tongue at me. The strange thing is, that slowly.. I see his tongue stretching out, thinning when it comes close to my face, - Then? - And then.. I see the tip of his tongue which begins to.. Tickle my cheek... the hollow of my ear, .. The neck and the tickling makes me laugh, I try to sidestep but that's not possible. I'm like paralyzed. I can't move anymore. And I'm laughing so much that I wake up with a start. Wait. I'd like a bra for my mother. Yes. - Which one would you like? - I don't know. You could try some. Not now. Later? - Call me when you see me on the beach. Ok? - Ok. It's him? Yes. You see, you should concern yourself a little with psychology and with what's happening within you. You should come with me Saturday. I'm going to a very well-known psychiatrist's lecture. I'm afraid I won't understand anything. Good morning. - Lucien Lebiche? - Yes. No, there's hasn't been any mistake. You haven't passed the exam. - On the other hand there's a message for you. - Really! - The Colonel wishes to meet you. - What for? I don't know. It's not written. How do you do? Colonel Tilleul. - Lucien Lebiche. - I know. Have you got a pen? I haven't, I'm sorry. Excuse me but I think there's a mistake with my results. Did you apply to work for the secret service? Erm. Yes, I know it might look a little ridiculous since I didn't pass the exams. But I'm sure there's something wrong. Why did you wish to work for the secret service? Erm.. it's like a child's dream, so.. When I saw on the forms that it was possible to tick if we wished to work in the secret service. Well, I ticked. Your request has been accepted. You'll work for the secret service. I.. I don't understand quite well. You will. You understand that we must act as if you officially failed so that nobody can suspect you're secretly working for the country. Well erm, what mission will I have? None. First we'll have to be sure of your discretion concerning your activity. We must be sure that nobody knows among your family and friends' circle. Not even your best friend Paul, neither your girlfriend Lucie. You know that you now need a cover. A cover? An activity to mask your true function. - I'm sorry, I've no ideas at the moment. - We've already thought for you. Your father being rather well-off, you'll be a dilettante for everybody. A dilettante? Yes, a spoiled little kid. Somebody who spend his time enjoying life.. Your code name will be "It's a nice day". It's a nice day. Thanks. Good bye. I forgot. Bring back as soon as possible the uniform you've borrowed.. And be careful with your laces, they're untied. - Good morning. - Good morning. Well. As indicated by the title of our lectures, "Psychology and future of the loving condition", today's lecture will aspire to carry out a reflection about the challenge that presents intimacy between men and women at the dawn of this 3rd millennium. So. Before tackling the heart of our matter, I'll open an opinion poll. Who among you knows in their circle, ladies and gentlemen, a happy couple? Put up your hand. One person. Amazing statistic.. Isn't it? As for me, I tend to think as psychoanalyst Jane Power that there's never been any intimacy between men and women. Indeed, how many couples can pretend that they love yet are still friends? Infinitely few couples achieve such harmony. Those who've reached this carry with them an aura of inventiveness and true love. Alas, most of people are mistaking falling in love with being in touch. Dad, I've decided to enjoy life. - Into my arms, my son! - Dad, you're covered in cream. Just a kiss then. You know, I'm so glad for you. I was worrying about how little influence I had on you. Now I can confess it to you. I've prayed for your failure. I hope you won't hold it against me. I won't. Anyway it was for your own good. At last genetic code is now operating. And I'll give your pocket-money a rise of 1000 Frs. - But.. it's not necessary, dad. - You'll see. If you want to enjoy life, you'll need it, you know. That should be the housemaid I've hired. Let her in, please. Show her around the home. Hello, Jennifer Thomas. I'm here for the job advert. Here is the... living-room. There, the kitchen A moment, please. Can I have the room's dimensions? The dimensions? Erm, I dunno. What for? To draw a diagram in my notebook. Yes, but what's the use? Once I have the dimensions, I can establish a cleaning program. I'll call "a", attraction. It admittedly is necessary to the encounter, but much people mix it up with love. And "A", friendship which is the indispensable condition for a true relation, but ignored by many. So which formula should I give to love if we had to give it one. It first looks a little simplistic but.. The simplest ones are not necessarily the worst. Especially since this intimacy between men and women, this couple's happiness, remains to be discovered. We are, you and me, in front of a new learning which first bases we have laid today. - Dad, the young woman is here. - Oh, sorry. I think there's a mistake. - Have we met before? - No, I'm here for the job advert. The one which came out last week. I know, I'm a bit late but I still came to try my luck. I'm sorry for the mix-up but the job is no longer vacant. - May I let you have my CV? - Yes. Of course. - Who knows. - Thank you. This might help the person who took my place. Shall I walk you to the door? Yes. Good bye. Look. She studied economics in France, Great Britain and United States, in the greatest universities. She speaks fluently five languages. That's crazy where unemployment can lead people! One would think that studies have become useless! Dad, I must go, Lucie's waiting for me. Or I'll be late. She must be the right one! Come, let me introduce her. - Hello Natasha - Hello. - Are you fine? - Yes, I'm fine very much. This is Lucien, my son. Natasha is Russian. - Hello. - Hi. You're fine? I am, thank you. I have to go. I'm in a hurry. - Good bye, dad. Good bye. - Good bye. It's for you. I mean, it's for your cleaning program. Good bye. Can I help you? My car has broken down. I just phoned the mechanic. He can't come before tomorrow. He told me that cleaning the spark plugs is enough but.. I don't know where to find them.. I'll have a look. Sorry, I don't know either. I've looked in the car. There's no instruction manual. I can drop you off somewhere if it helps. I don't want to bother you. I live away from the city. That's not a problem. I prefer to warn you now. I only recently got my driving license so it's preferable not to speak to each other while I'm driving. I can't get any connection here. Me neither. Don't you have an emergency petrol can in your boot? No. I'm really sorry.. Since I try to really concentrate on the road, I can't manage to analyse all the dashboard lights. Excuse-me. Do you mind a little stop? I have gravel in my shoes and I might need time to take them off. Very good. I have gravel too. Is it ok? Can you find your way? Yes, we shouldn't be too far now. It's a nice day. - Sorry? - I said It's a nice day. You mean, you find that the weather is fine. Yes. Don't you? Erm.. I do. Yes. I mean.. I totally agree with you. Do you want a chewing gum? Yes. Thank you. I don't know. Is it a new brand? My uncle produces them. It's from Australia. So I've always a lot of them at home. Excuse-me, I know the question can sound indiscreet but.. I'd be curious to know what led you to apply for a cleaner's job. It's because I just finished my studies. So I thought, in order to be more efficient in the management jobs one will offer to me, it would be interesting to experience from the inside a simple employee's job. I think that the more you know the base of the pyramid the better you feel when you're at the top. And you, what's your occupation? Nothing to do with that. I.. I've decided to enjoy life. Really? Really. What you're doing is very close to new concerns for me. Is it? Yes. Till now, I've devoted all my time to studies. Did you? When you say "enjoy life", does it encompass sensual pleasures? Yeah, of course. I can imagine that, as for you, you've probably had many relationships with girls. Erm.. yes. Indeed, yes. How many? I don't know.. about 60. Hello. Paul! No, Lucien isn't here. Do you want him to call you back? Where are you? Biarritz! - Hello! - Lucie, it's me. Lucien! - Hey, I've been waiting for you! - That's because I was with Paul. I mean, I'm still with him now but.. In fact, he doesn't feel good, he's feeling down.. I just wanted to tell you not to wait for me to eat. Okay? Erm.. ok, ok. See you. Hello. Paul? Yes, it's Lucien. I'm calling quickly just to tell you that I'm supposed to be with you now if Lucie asks. I told her that you were feeling down, etc... It's a little complicated, I'll explain it to you later. What, you're in Biarritz?! Really! Really. Good bye. Lucien! I've found the house. Victor will drive you to your car with a petrol can. Thank you. Sure you don't want to stay for dinner. My parents aren't here. I'm gonna be alone. I'd like to stay very much but I really must go. I was really delighted to meet you. So was I. We might probably have a kiss.. Yes. Good bye. Good bye. May I offer you a drink? Don't be surprised. I just passed my exam at the Theater Conservatoire. And I'm happy. I'll have another mint cordial. Ok. A mint cordial, please. Are you an actor? - Have you understood everything? - I have, yes. Ah! You drank your mint cordial too quickly. Good night, are you fine? - This is Paul. - Good evening. Paul is an old childhood friend. We were together at nursery school. We met by chance and.. Well, I dunno, how long since we saw each other? So, we talked and talked. - Besides Paul is feeling really down right now. - That's true. But on the phone, I thought you were with Paul. - I mean the other one.. the one I know. - Really?! Excuse me. I probably look stupid but I pictured some bad things. - Which ones? - You won't understand! That's so stupid it's not even worth talking about. Paul, you'll stay for a drink, won't you? No, Paul hasn't time, he's in a hurry. He.. Haven't you a meeting? I still have time for a drink. We'll have it outside after all. Come on, Paul! I'm very happy to meet you at least, the girlfriend of.. My old friend. I'm very happy to meet you too, Paul. - Do you want something to nibble? - Ok. - My name is Lucien. - Okay, fine. - Apart from that, am I good? - Yes, yes. - I can be even better. - No, it's fine this way. I'm so happy to see you again. Did you really meet at nursery school? Yes, besides I remember it as if it were yesterday. Tell me, Lucien never told me anything. At nursery school, he was very.. very strong. - Really! Strong? - Yes. He was a big fat kid, that's why he was stronger than the others. - Fat? - Indeed, he couldn't stop eating. I remember. He always had a banana in the hand. It's engraved in my memory. Each time I.. I see him, I see a little fat kid with a banana in his hand. That's why his nickname was Bouboule. Bouboule! Bouboule. Why haven't you ever told me this? Paul, do you want something else? No. I think I'll go now, thank you. Confidence and its psychological benefits Come on, Bernard! Bernard! Then you're tickling my cheek and my ear with your tongue, and in the end you're tickling me so much with your tongue.. That I wake up. Really? Well, I must go. Let me know if you're still having this dream. Didn't you try to have an interpretation? Well, I've been told and I've read.. That it could be.. an erotic dream. Really? I don't believe it though, 'cos I'm not a bit attracted to you. - Ah! Not at all! I don't know what to say. And if I was subconsciously attracted by you?! That would be horrible. Horrible is maybe too much. Well, I'm going. - Can you kiss me? - Pardon? Now, before I go, can you kiss me? So that I would know whether I'm attracted or not. Erm, yes. If it helps you. Good night. Good night. Tell me, Lucien. - Are we friends, the two of us? - Why are you asking this? He wanted to kiss me a second time. But I told him.. there was no need. It was obvious with the first kiss that we didn't get on well. He knows how to kiss. But it's not the same with you. Here it is. I thought I should absolutely tell you about everything so that our relationship will be healthier. You see? You know, few couples talk as freely as we do. Most of them fear what the other thinks. Possibly, I had this dream in order to achieve this progress in our relationship. Don't you think so? Yes. Yes. Hello. Hello Lucien. It's Jennifer Thomas, do you remember me? I found your number in the phone book. I hope I'm not calling too late. But you didn't appear to me like somebody going to bed early. No. No. Why are you talking like this? I have a sore throat. - I wanted to ask you something. - I'm listening. No, not here, not on the phone. Can we meet tomorrow at noon? Yes. At 12, but.. where? At what time do you go to work tomorrow? I'm not working tomorrow. It's Sunday, you know, and we promised to have dinner with your father. Ah!? I don't get it, you haven't a temperature. One can perfectly well feel bad without having a temperature. - Well, I'm calling a doctor. - No, no. I don't feel sick, I just feel bad. I feel like it's gonna disappear but I don't know when. If you're not feeling well, I'd prefer to stay with you. No. What would make me happy is that you enjoy your day. I'd feel really guilty to waste it all. I'm calling your father. I'm staying with you. Hello. Hello, could I.. but what are you doing? I'm feeling better. I don't know why, once standing up, it's better. In fact, the horizontal position probably didn't allow an appropriate blood circulation. Come on, get dressed. Everything's packed. My book... where have I put my book? I can't find it. I put it here. You haven't got dressed yet! Come on, quick. Why are looking at me like this? Haven't you ever seen a beautiful girl! - What are you doing now? - I'm looking for my suit. - What's the matter with you? - Nothing, well.. I had a sudden urge... to kiss you. Then kiss me, Bouboule. I love when you drive fast like that. My heart beats. Can you tell me the time, please? It's gone 11 o'clock. Can you wait 5 minutes? Natasha is watching a film. It's the end. I show her films. The poor girl, she needs to improve her French. I'm finishing washing up and we'll come at once. There's a place not far from here, very beautiful too. It's called Cale Longue. - I'd love to go swimming there! - Now? Yes. Can you give me my swimming suit, please? It comes from 'cale'. 'Cale' means 'calanque'. And 'longue', because the calanque's mouth is very long: 'Cale longue'. What 'mouth' means? Mouth, well.. Me don't understand. It's opening.. I'm sure I packed it. I'm not crazy yet. It happens. Sometimes you'd bet you did this when you didn't. It happens to me too. Don't worry, I'll go home and get it. Listen, you could swim in boxer shorts. No, no, in shorts here, I can't. I.. I'll give you one of mine, if you want. Erm.. no! I hate wearing out of fashion clothes. There and back. I won't be long. Eat first, go after dinner. Yes, but I really want to have a swim now. Start eating without me, I'll be quick. Lucien, Lucien! Can I ask you a favour? Can you take Natasha home? She's not used to the sun nor the heat, she'd prefer watching television to improve her French. Isn't there a TV set in the restaurant? It's on your way. You won't lose time. Natasha! Thanks Lucien. - Have you got the time, please? - Yes. - We say: five to twelve. - Okay. Natasha, may I ask you the time once more please? - For this, we say: five past twelve. - Okay. I've got a little thing to do. I won't be long.. Me wait you. Look, Lucien's there. Lucien! Are you fine? What are you doing here? Is Lucie with you? No. No, no.. I made a mistake. I mean, it's a mistake. - Good bye. - Well, so long! - I'll be back. I'll be back. - Yes, as you wish. Jennifer! Jennifer! Bonjour. Should we kiss? Yes. Don't you want to eat? No. I'm not hungry. I'm not either, I have a knot in my stomach. - We can have a walk along the harbour. - No. No, no. Shall we walk in the direction of the hill? - Yes. - It's very nice. It's very nice there too. It's a shame it's burned. Yes. Is your throat better? Ah! Yes, yes. I wrapped up correctly and it's gone. Yes, one must be careful because the nights are cool. In fact it's so hot during the daytime that no one takes precautions. I had a throat sore too last week. - Did you? - I did. I called you because I have something to ask you. Yes? Would you agree to have a sensual affair with me? Don't worry, I'm absolutely not in love with you. I'd just like to learn how to make the most of my youth. And I thought I could use the opportunity of your experience. Pardon. I'm turning it off. I know, I have nothing to offer you in return so I'd understand if you'd refuse. Well, so you agree? I do, I mean, yes. I agree. Thanks. You're welcome. No, it's nice. Is tomorrow at ten convenient for you? Because my parents aren't at home. Yes, ok. Are you taking this photo, yes or no! The sun is in my eyes. Are you taking it or not?! Yes, I'm adjusting. Do you want us to exchange a kiss now? Or should we do it all tomorrow? It may be good to exchange a kiss now. It's not bad what we're doing, is it? It's not, no. I mean.. Not at all. Is it ok, am I kissing correctly? You are, yes. And me, was it ok? Yes, I suppose so. - What are you doing? You're not even looking at me! - I am! - Hello. - Yes. Hi, it's Bernard. Six. Are you fine? Erm yes. I'm calling because I was just thinking about your dream.. And I wondered if you were still having it? I do. Can we meet to have a drink? No. No, I'm not free at the moment. Well, I'll call you back another time to see if there's something new, ok? Ok. - Hello. - Good morning, it's Lucien. Yes. I'm gonna open but first I'd like to ask you something. Really? I feel a little nervous for our date. - Really? - Yes. Contrary to the impression I'm giving I'm a very shy person. - You want to cancel it, is that so? - No, no. I just wanted to ask you if you would agree to forbid ourselves from talking when we're together. Till the end. Do you mind? I don't. I'm just afraid to panic and start talking to postpone the physical act. Jennifer! Hello. Jennifer! I did it on purpose. It's an old trick to stop the hiccups. Don't you know that? It's really a famous trick in France though. That's ridiculous.. If you want, we can put this off till later. No, I'd prefer we cancel. Well.. I'll go then. Do you want me to open the gate? Yes, please. Thanks. It's a nice day. - Did you say it's a nice day? - Erm yes, it's brighter now. Ah! - Good bye. - Good bye. Lucie, I'm repeating myself but I promise nothing happened at all. This photo doesn't reveal anything about the real situation. I barely know this girl, she means nothing to me. Besides she's far away now, she's an American, she's already gone home. I did that to do her a favour. I swear I did that to do her a favour. You can't hold it against me because I do a favour to others! Listen, Lucien. What you've done with this girl, whether you've done her a favour or not, whether you've slept with her, that's not what it means to me. What it means to me is that you hid it from me. Our relationship is ridiculous. We've been together for ten years and.. I find out that I know you no better than a stranger. Come on.. You're going too far. Too far? You tell me you want to be a policeman and.. Overnight you decide to enjoy life. You're going to get your swimming suit and in fact.. You're making it with an American girl. Maybe I'll find out soon that you are a secret agent. Don't go! I'm not going. This is your case. Hey, you're crazy or what! Excuse me, I'm sorry Thanks Natasha. - You want drink something? - I'd like to have a 16, please. - What is 16? - A beer! Ah! I understand why you came here to live in the meantime. That must be strange to have a housemaid. - Does she sleep here? - Yes. - Where? - There, further down. - Thanks. Are you Russian? - Yes. - How old are you? - Twenty nine. - Do you have a boyfriend? - Erm.. I do not understand. - Don't you like her? - I don't know. I'm sure you have a chance with her. One says that Russian girls are very generous and affectionate. You're dreaming of an affair, aren't you! Have you really decided to enjoy life or is it just hooey? Yes, no. I have, really. - Are you sure? - Yes, yes. I'll be back. I'm going to wash my hands. If, from your side, .. It's mutual.. I'm looking forward to.. The signs of your.. Affection. Lu- cien. Well, I have to go. I still need to work a little. Hello. No, no, it's not a nice day. Oh, yes! Yes, it's a nice day. Yes. Very good. A woman in red. Tomorrow at noon, fine. I'll be there. A parcel? What kind of hat do I have to wear? One second. I'll write the address. No, no, I'm not writing. I'll memorize everything. Me don't read French. - What does mean? - Erm, it's.. It's Lucien.. Who asks if you wouldn't.. Mind ironing his clothes? No problem. - Me can phone in Russia for birthday? - Yes, of course. Thanks. Thanks a lot. Yes? Your papa want talk you. Tell him I'll be there in 5 minutes. If you need me, possible. No need to write little world. - Well, I think you can hug your father. - How come? I've been 2 hours on the phone with Lucie. It was hard but she agrees at last; - She's waiting for you tonight for dinner. - Really?! Careful, she told me to tell you clearly that it's pure friendship. That there's nothing else behind it. But.. It's a good first move. Beware! One doesn't have two irons in the fire. - Hi. - Hi. - Well, it hasn't changed here! - No. - I brought you some wine. It's a good one. - Hm. Put it on the table. Why are all these bottles for? Are there some guests? - Did you organize a party? - No, no. That's our dinner. There's nothing to eat?! No. That's an idea I had. You know, it's said that alcohol makes people talk. Like when we're amongst friends, we gather, we drink, we talk, we confide and in the end we forget to eat. Don't you drink? I don't feel like it at the moment, my stomach is empty. Precisely, it's on purpose. It takes effect more quickly this way. Unless.. You're afraid to be under the influence of alcohol? Not to control your speech anymore? Afraid to uncover yourself, - to be yourself? - Listen, Lucie, I know you'd like me to confide in you, but believe me, I have nothing particular to confide. I need a relationship not only based on attraction but also on friendship. If you're not interested in this, it's better you go now. Ok, fine. I'm gonna drink. - Come on, we'll talk now. - Later. You've said this for an hour now. You're making no effort to talk. - Later. - No. Lucien! Lucien, if you don't want to confide in me, I'd rather you went home. Lucien, in the name of our friendship, I beg you, calm down. I'll devour you. You thought you could escape me, didn't you? What are you doing? Well, it's.. Good morning dad! It's a trick Paul told me about. When your head aches and you drank too much.. the night before, you have a little from the same alcohol you drank to excess and then, it goes away. A woman in red. A parcel. Noon. Yeah, we enjoyed it a lot, that was great. Yes, but don't worry, ok! Ok, I'll be back in five minutes. Love you. Bye. Excuse-me. - Could you tell me the time, please? - Yes, yes, it's.. - ...five to twelve. - Thank you. Lucie Deneige. Hi! - Alright? - Euh, yes. What are you buying? To know more about yourself Look, I bought the same. - Good bye. - Are you sure you haven't any time for a drink? I'm sorry, I have to go to work. Some other time maybe. Everything's fine? I'm really sorry about yesterday evening. You could have introduced me. Friends of my friends are my friends. Ah, you mean.. the woman, but.. I don't know her at all. She just asked the way. Really?! And what is the parcel she gave you then? If you don't want to talk about your mysterious activities.. No, there isn't any mysterious activity! - Why then do you look so embarrassed? - I don't look embarrassed. - You do. - I don't. Really. We might ask the gentleman there watching us, mister! No, no. I'm gonna tell you the truth. Here it is, I'm telling you the truth. - I'm telling. - I'm listening. In fact, I met this woman some days ago and.. And we slept together. And now, we just met to put an end to this very superficial relation. And she gave me back the clothes I had left at her home. That's it. Lucien, I'm very glad you've confided in me at last. I'm very very touched that you.. Could manage to talk to me truly and I consider that.. It is a first real step for our friendship. Well, I have to go now because I'm in a hurry but.. - Let's call, okay? - Yes, yes. Fine. Good bye! It's a nice day. - Do you have the parcel? - Erm.. I do. I do. - Have you been followed? - No, I haven't. Where should I deliver it? You'll take the plane for Antananarivo at Marignane airport in 3 hours. Travel purpose: tourism, detente, meetings. You'll be contacted there for the next move. Any questions? - Is it a dangerous mission? - If all goes fine, it's not. Is it ok? Do you need something else? - Have you something against mosquitoes? - Of course. - Here it is. - Excuse me. What are the effects of this medicine, 'Cogiton'? It's useful to develop memory and increase intellectual capacities. Fine, I'll take one box. No, two. Are you going? Yes, dad. Is it settled with Lucie? Erm, no. I won a trip in one of those scratch games but the condition is to leave at once. I'd like to talk with you now if.. Right now, no, it's impossible, I'm really in a hurry. My plane is leaving in 50 minutes. Please, Lucien, one minute. You'll go faster and I'll pay you back if you get a speeding ticket. I don't know how to say it but I think.. I wanted to say that I think, that I have affection.. And even feelings for Natasha. - Does she? - I don't know yet but.. Certain signs encourage me to think that she's not insensitive to me and.. To my charm. - This is really good. - Aren't you jealous? - No, no. - Really?! Yes. Thanks, Lucien. Remove the compress. It's blue but quite unnoticeable already. That's a cocktail I invented. I called it 'caress from the hills', to ease the pain. Girls love it. You'll see. It'll relax you. Tell me, have you dreamt about me again? It feels strange to know that I exist in your unconscious. You know, I've already been in the same situation as you. How? I had a girlfriend who deceived me. As I was jealous, I had decided to take revenge with another girl. Really?! Yes. So? I couldn't do it. I haven't found one girl who wanted me. I thought girls were attracted by you. Girls think I'm handsome, in general, but it doesn't go further. I intimidate them maybe or I'm too shy, I don't know. People think it's easy to appeal when you're handsome. That's totally wrong. On the contrary. One tends rather to be wary of handsome people. You're lucky to have someone who thinks you're beautiful and desirable. You know, I'm always telling the truth about what I think. I can't do otherwise. The decoration is nice here. I like it. That's funny because at school I was very attracted by you. Really?! What's the matter? I'm sorry. Why are you sorry? I don't want to upset you but I'm not attracted by you. - That's not how I felt with your kiss. - Really?! I don't know. I'll have to think about it. I'm going now. I'm going to work because I haven't done anything today. Tell me, Lucien. Are we friends, the two of us? Now that I've told you everything, I feel something more between us. The important thing is.. you hid it from me. When I was trying to talk with you! - You're making no effort to have a talk. - Later. - Could you tell me the time, please? - Five to three. Hello, Marignane's airport? Yes, good morning. I'm calling you because I've got wind of an explosive device that could be located in the baggage hold of a plane to Antananarivo. Ah, you're welcome! I'm just doing my citizen's duty. Hold the line please. What's to be done when someone says there's a bomb on a plane? I don't know. Was it serious? How would I know? Lucie, I've things to tell you. I'm with a client. That's not a problem. Come on, take your time. Erm.. here it is! You told me we could live again together as a couple only with someone who could freely talk with you, who dares tell you about everything, right? Right. Well, I've thought about it. Let's do things completely, I'm gonna tell you everything I didn't dare to tell and you'll definitely tell me whether you want to live with me or not. Now, here, at once? Yes, I mean, I'll try. So!.. just two seconds to know what I'll begin with. You remember the little blue dress you bought? You asked me if I liked it and I told you I did. Well in fact, I didn't really like it. I wonder why you bought it. I don't like it at all. Now: I.. You remember when you're telling me about philosophy and asking me if I'm interested with it and I'm telling you I am. Well.. in fact, most of the time, I'm not really interested. I even think sometimes it's stupid. Something different now! You know, when sometimes I was stroking your body and, sometimes I could close my eyes then and.. Think about another girl, I don't know, one of your friends, Isabelle.. Marie, Prudence, .. Wait, wait.. I still have things to tell you. You see, each time I have an erotic dream, it's with you but.. Once it wasn't you who was in my dream, it was a blonde girl. But blonde, very, very blonde! Once I also had an erotic dream with.. With a girl but who looked exactly like a boy. Otherwise there's one dream which affected me deeply but.. I never dared to tell you, and even now, it's embarrassing. I dreamt that I was tying you up, that you were my slave. And it haunted me because I still think about it in the daytime. It's okay, is it interesting so far? Is this what you were hoping for? Anyway, you're right, because the simple act of telling.. Is really beneficial to me. 15 days later ... The flight 432 from Antananarivo has just arrived. - Hello. - Hello. - It's nice day? - Ah.. yes, yes, it's a nice day. Congratulations. Your first mission is over. - But what should I do with the parcel? - You can throw it away. It was a diversion in order to protect another mission.. Really?! Yes, it worked really well. But you know, I haven't had a thing to do. Don't underestimate yourself, that was very good. Excuse me, I'd like to ask you something. I'm listening. Is it possible to change cover? How do you say 'confortable'? What do you do when they say it's too expensive? Excuse me. Thank you! You're welcome.
