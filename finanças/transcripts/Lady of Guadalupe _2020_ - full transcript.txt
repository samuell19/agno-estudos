John. How's your wife? Same. She's just doing the same. If not worse. She may never come back. I'm sorry. I should have been with her, Father. And I wasn't, Father. Think about the moments you've had together, instead of the ones you have not. I'm trying. I'm trying. Hi. Hi, can I help you? Yeah, do you have any books on Pancho Villa? Yes, HH-17. HH-17, thank you. Of course. I'm sorry. Aisle HH-17. - Oh, it's the other one. - Yeah. Okay. Hey, do you like Christmas parties? That's a personal question. Of course I do, everybody does. Can I get your number? What for? So I can maybe invite you to a really cool Christmas party. I don't know you. Right. Yeah, you're right. So then, allow me to introduce myself. John Martinez. A young and ambitious reporter. Pleasure to meet you, John. Pleasure to meet you too. But I still don't know you. But if you give me your number, you'll get to know me better. John, would you give a complete stranger your number? Only to a cute one like you. Okay. This better be a great party. Thank you. Of course. Thank you for coming all the way to meet with me here. Please tell me what happened after the Virgin appeared in Mexico. Putiline, how's your father? Good. Say hello to him. I will. Michitaga. My cousin. Do you like the flowers? Yes. They're fresh and beautiful. Just like you. I think they'll make a perfect offering for Gonati. An offering? Yes. So I can maybe give you a son. I don't want you getting a second wife. My love. I don't need a second wife. I love you. Just you. So do I, my sweet man. Will you come with me? To lay my offering? It is a beautiful day for an offering. You got it? Latin Heritage Day. Yeah, okay. Yeah, bye. Mr. John Martinez. How can I help you? Please, don't make me do this. Don't give me another Latino story, please. What's wrong with the story I gave you? There's nothing wrong. John, do you remember when I hired you, I told you that it would take a while to establish a career here? Besides, you are our Latin specialist. Boss, please. No, no. Of course you can, come on, I mean... What is your last name? What about my last name? You know my last name. What is your last name? Martinez. There, that sounds like Latin specialist. The Latin specialist only gives me a story to write every two weeks. And? And I wanna write more. I want to try to make more money. John, when you bring in a quality story, then we can talk about money. I'm under pressure here, you know? Mary's having our first baby. Congratulations. Well, you know, every baby is a blessing. Is it a girl or a boy? No, she's gonna be a girl. - Wow. - Yeah. Oh, wait. That's a real Cuban cigar. Thank you. Well... Thank you, boss. Look, I just want to know if there is some future for me here, that's all. Stop, John, you have a future here. You know, I gave the piece to Michael because that's what he does. He's all over it. Just look at him. He knows all about it. So, that's his thing. But you're old school, man. Hey, you still type up your stories on a typewriter. That's because I have no money for a laptop. I mean, that's the only reason. I've got an opportunity for you here, okay? If you would just write quality Latin stories, you could make more money than all of these editors here. So, you're taking that class? Not yet. Well, let's get with it. You need to find out about the Lady of Guadalupe and the native that she spoke to. You mean Juan Diego. Very good, John, you are doing your research. So we're clear. You'll write a story about faith. Because after all, faith is the most important thing in the holidays. You're right. Faith, John. Faith. Faith. - Faith. - Okay. Faith. Thanks for the cigar. Hi, John. I have some things for you. Really, what's all this? So, how's Mary? She's doing fine, thank you. Is she ready? Ready for what? For the baby to pop. You know how it is. It's been hard to get some sleep lately. Give me a second. Mr. Dominguez's office. How may I... Mr. Dominguez's office. How may I help you? Ah, Mr. Dominguez, yes. Yes, he's here. Uh-huh. Uh-huh. Yes, okay. Bye. Mr. Dominguez asked me to tell you to get your A-S-S moving. And you better be there tonight. Tonight? Yeah, tonight. Mary's gonna kill me, you know that, right? Yeah. What's up? What's going on? Hey. Wow. That's pretty cool. Hey, sir? Sir? Que? What? How much for a hot dog? $2. Let me have one. - Everything on it? - Sure thing. So that's the Lady of Guadalupe, huh? Si, that's my Virgin, Guadalupe. She's helped me get over here to America and start my cart and do everything. That's pretty cool. She does a lot of miracles, man. Here you go. Thank you. Here's your change. You know what, this is for you. Thank you. Hey, amigo. She takes care of you and protects you. Take care, have a good one. Hey, babe? You have three new messages, message one. Hey, John. - Baby? - This is your dad. Listen, when you get this, give me a call. I hope you're doing fine, son. And I know that you always miss your mom around these days. So, give me a call, okay? Bye. Message two. This is a message for Mr. John Martinez. This is Sally calling from All Wire Power. We haven't received your last payment. Please be sure to submit it as soon as possible. Thank you and have a great day. Message three. Hi, Honey. I called you on your horrible cellphone, but you didn't pick up. So, I had to go run and get some stuff for tonight, but I left you some cookies. Love you. Miss you, Mom. Honey? Hey, babe. - Hey. - I gotta tell you, these cookies are phenomenal. They're awesome, right? They are incredible. Ah, that's so good. Where do you get 'em from? Well, I hunted down these Girl Scouts, and when they weren't looking and they were distracted, I snatched it from them and then I ran. Oh yeah, you ran? Yeah, I did. Well, okay, maybe not quite. I rolled. Well, thanks for rolling for my cookies. Oh, so. Babe, did you get that article you wanted? No, I didn't. Really? Yeah, no. So sorry. Mr. Domingez is forcing me to take this theology class because he wants to have me writing a new article about Latin faith. Well, I think that's interesting. Well, yeah. Tonight. Oh, okay. Well, can you go next week? No, no, they have a new speaker coming in and I gotta be there tonight. I'm so sorry. Sorry. It's okay. Don't worry. Baby showers are for girls anyway, right? So... It's okay. - It's okay? - Yeah. So you're not mad? - No. - You're not mad? - I am not mad. - I don't believe you. I'm not mad. Look seriously, I hate you driving that car at night. Maybe your mom can pick you up? Me and my trusty car, we're fine. And why don't, you know what? Why don't you catch up with me after class and you drive me home. Deal. - Deal? - Yeah. Okay. Another one. No, whoa, whoa. I'm glad that you're taking this class and that you get to learn about your family culture. Oh, yeah. And look, I will take pictures and tell you about whatever you missed at our baby shower. I wanna go. What? Sure you do. Seriously, I wanna be there, I wanna be there with you. Don't worry. You're always with me. And. What is that? For you. Just catch up with me when you can. When you get out of class. You are the most beautiful woman on Earth, and the most important thing in my life. You know that, right? Our lives. What? Tell me. - She is moving. - Is she? - Wanna feel her kick? - Yeah. Yeah? You better get going, you're gonna be late. Yeah. - I hate this car. - Don't be grumpy. Bye, babe. - Bye. - I love you. I love you too. It is God who has given us Guadalupe. It wasn't invented by any man. I know your professor will be covering some of the miracles attributed to Guadalupe, but first things first. The image is on cactus paper. And in over 400 years, it hasn't deteriorated or aged. Second, look at the stars that surround her. They identically match the stars in the winter sky at 1531. When she appeared to Juan Diego. The stars are not in a pattern as we see from Earth. But in a perspective, as if looking down to us from the heavens. Also, look at her eyes. You can see the image of Juan Diego too small and way too detailed to have been painted by any man at that time. Juan is praying. And keep in mind, all this happened in 1531. These things could not have been done by any man. Yes? I just have a question, Father. Today, with all the access we have to technology and science, how does the story of Lady of Guadalupe even remain relevant? Does love, hospitality, security, simplicity still important today? Now, Juan has learned that... I'm so sorry for the interruption, and I don't mean to be rude. But is there any proof Juan Diego even existed? What's your name? John. John, are you a theology major? No, Father, I'm just writing an article. I'm so sorry. I'm sorry about this. I'm so sorry. Thank you. Yeah, as I was explaining to you, I'm just writing an article for something outside of academia. Sounds very interesting. Please speak with me after class. I will. And rememberturn off your phone. Yeah, I'm sorry. We'll get through the rest of your questions next time. Hold on, hold on, hold on. We want to thank Father Xavier Escalada, our visiting Spanish Jesuit scholar. Father Escalada lived most of his life in Mexico. He's a Guadeloupan historian. Father, thank you for sharing those wonderful insights with us. Now you may go. I gotta run, Father. Thank you so much. Always a pleasure. Father. I wanna thank you as well, and I need to apologize for my phone ringing. Don't worry. Tell me about the article you're writing. It's not a big deal. Everything matters in God's eyes, my son. Yeah. I'm writing for the Latin Voice, you know, the newspaper. Just a small article about faith in Latin culture. And the Lady of Guadalupe is my starting point. She's always a good place to start. I agree with that. I would love to have your insights. And I don't know if you wanna share some materials. Like what? Like things you don't find in books. Of course, let me show you some materials. Yeah, sure. Here's some materials that might help with your... Father, I gotta ask you this one more time. Do you think Juan Diego really existed? It's always difficult to have faith, my son. Check them out and we'll talk again later. Thank you. And remember, Juan Diego lived in a time that would be considered a modern-day war zone. Can I actually get your number? - Sure. - Yeah? I'm so sorry again. I don't know what's happening but let me take this one. Just one second. Hello. Yes. I'm from the Medical Center. Is this Mr. Martinez? Yeah, this is John Martinez. Yes, your wife's been in a serious car accident. What? She's in critical condition. You need to come down here right away. I'm on my way. - Is everything okay? - No, Father. It's my wife. She's at the hospital right now. - Of course. - Thank you. We'll get together later. Yes. Food's ready. Father Da Gand was speaking to a group of us. He said my spirit could be saved into eternal life. In the heavens. Your spirit is fine. It's the land that the Spaniards are concerned about. Priests are trying to learn and understand our ways. They say we're all sons of the same god. We're not that different. Some corn? Your cousin, Utaka, told me that their priests visit the villages escorted by soldiers. They talk about love and eternal life. So why do they need to be escorted by soldiers? Can I go with you to hear the priests? Yes, my love. But it's far away. I don't mind. You should fear the wrath of our gods. You're right, Uncle. Our gods are full of fear and wrath. Tonight I'm meeting with the elders. You should support your people. I support my people. I do not support violence. Do it for me. Okay, Uncle. I will go with you. Mr. Martinez. Yes. I'm Dr. Patel, you can come in now. Yeah. How is she? We're doing everything we can to save her and the baby. But you need to know she's in critical condition. I need to get your garments so you can see your wife. Dr. Flinn, 55-450. Dr Flinn, 55- I'll be right back with your garments. Thank you. Fly, baby. I'm here. I'm here. Stay with me, baby. Stay with me, don't leave. Don't leave, stay with me. Don't leave. Stay with me. Hi, John, who is this lovely young woman, your daughter? I don't have any kids, Rosie. - You know that, right? - I'm just kidding. Yeah. Rosie, this is Mary. - Nice to meet you, Mary. - Nice to meet you, Rosie. So where did you meet her? On one of my many exciting Latin investigations. Okay, nevermind. Mary, how did you meet him? I met him at the library and he asked for my number to invite me to this party. - Really? - And he told me that there was gonna be amazing wine here. And he lied. He lied. The wine is great, yeah. I'm a liar. You see, Mary? All men are liars, all liars. I thought it was gonna be great. Another lie, men don't think. Okay, well, Mary, I will see you around. Later. Whoa, whoa, whoa. No more Christmas wine for you. I mean, why? I thought that was your plan. My plan? Yes, your plan. Here's Johnny! Yeah. Hello, boss. Ooh, and who is this lovely lady? Hi, I'm Mary. - Hi. - Hi. How can I help you? Are you lost, can I get you something? No, no, no. I'm not lost, I'm with him. But, thank you. Well, don't stay too long with this one or you will get lost. Funny, very funny. Do you mind? No, please. Go ahead. Wait for me? Sure. John, come in. Hi, Father. Please, sit down. Thank you for taking time to meet with me. I'm always glad to help. How's your wife? She's not good, Father. She was driving to her mother's house and apparently she got hit by a drunk driver. Dear God. She's in critical care now. Be strong and have faith, my son. God never puts you in a situation that you cannot handle. Gotta be honest with you, Father. I've never been big on faith. There are certain things that I just, I don't understand. Do you wanna start with the interview now? Of course. Please tell me about the environment in the life of Juan Diego or around the time of the miracle. The Spaniards continued to colonize what is now Mexico. Diseases traveled with the Spanish, spread like wildfire. It was a true dark time for the New Spain. Holy Roman Emperor, Charles V. Your Highness, though we tried to bring our true God to a people suffering without him, we have had too little success. The night is dark and hope is far beyond what simple men can request of the Lord, our Savior. The natives are restless, resent us. And legends of the curse of Montezuma are spreading in the region. The natives are plotting against us. It is my belief only a miracle can save us. You all know why we are here. The Spanish believe they are all-powerful. But Montezuma knew these men were not gods. They are simple mortals. They have taken over our cities and our women. Yes, but we made them flee the city. Victories can be short-lived. Especially if the Spanish continue to invade our other cities. This war is far from over. There is still far more of us than there are of them. And how do you propose we defeat them? We need to make a sacrifice to our gods. But we have no prisoners. We have a prisoner. The Spanish will pay to our gods. - Uncle. - They do not understand our gods now. Uncle. But soon - they will. - You cannot believe what they are saying. I do. Maybe the Spanish priests have made you weak, nephew. They have not made me weak. But wise. Wise? Yes. Wise enough to know there's another place where I should be. If your father was still alive. think what he would want you to do. The right thing. Always. Where are you going? I am leaving. I must tend to my wife. Shouldn't it be your wife attending to you? Or is it the Spanish you must attend to? The Spanish? What would they need from me? I am a poor, humble man. I hope you all can see this violence will take us nowhere. What is your name? My father named me. Talking Eagle. You are a coward. I am a humble servant. And I only mean peace. You're late. Not as late as I could've been. What's wrong? My uncle. And some of the elders are going crazy. They caught a Spaniard. Beat him. And now they wanna sacrifice him. I told you not to go. I know. I should've listened to you. Where are you going? I have to do something. He's gone. IF we cannot find him, one of you will be offered to the gods. I can't walk with you all the way. Follow the path. You will find your people. Where are you going? I need to go back to my wife. What is your name? I am Juan. Thank you. Thank him. My love, you're safe. What is this? I don't know. Maybe bug bites. Why didn't you tell me about this before? I didn't want you to worry. You're burning up. I'm okay. And you're stubborn. Let's go see Father Da Gand. So my son, you like the name of Juan? Yes. I very much like the name, Diego. How does that sound to you? - Good. - Yes? Juan Diego it is. Come, come, my son, come. I baptize you Juan Diego. And now Juan, your wife. Come, you like the name, Maria? - Yes. - Yes? You know today is also the day of Santa Lucia. How do you like Lucia? - Yes. - Very good, come, come. My child, I baptize you Maria Lucia. Let us pray for the health of your wife. Holy Mary, full of grace. Stop this betrayal of our gods. Cowards. We are here in peace. You are a traitor. My name is Juan Diego now. And I'm not a traitor. You took our prisoner. I took no one. I freed an innocent man who was being tortured. You have no right to save and bring peace. You will pay for your betrayal with your life. You are a coward. Guards! Uncle. Uncle. It's just a little scratch. I'll be okay. Johnny, where's the story? Look, I will have it as soon as possible. Just don't miss the print deadline. Actually, I don't know if I'm gonna be able to make the deadline. It's just that since the accident I've spent most of my time at the hospital. Well, as you should. And how is Mary? She's stable. But critical. Well, look, if you don't feel you can make the deadline, don't worry about it, we'll figure something out. I'm sorry, I'm sorry. Don't be sorry. Listen, if you wanna talk or anything, I'll be in the office. Thank you, boss. Okay, take care. I'm sorry, Father, I'm gonna have to head back now. But thank you for all this information. My pleasure, John. If you find any other detail, just give me a ring. You have my number. Are you going to the hospital? Yeah, yeah. I'm gonna have to stop by the office first. How are you going to get there? Just gonna take a bus, thank you. Wait. Let me show you something. Here, you can drive my car. Oh, no, no, no, Father, no, I can't. Look, you lost your car. Besides, I don't need it. The college got me another one. And I can't drive two cars at the same time. Thank you. I almost forgot. Take this. Father, you didn't have to. She will protect you while you drive my car. God, be with you, my son. Thanks. I told you it was Latin Heritage Day. Not Latin Hermitage Day. Come in. I don't care about hermits even if they are Latinos. Did you see this? - Yeah. - How is this even possible? I don't know. How are you holding on, John? Just holding. So, what's the problem with the story? What do you mean? It just seems like you don't wanna embrace your Latin culture. No, no, no, no, it's not that. It's just like... Martinez, you are Latino Americano. Own it. When you put it that way, yeah. Come on, give it a try. Writing will occupy your mind and will probably keep you employed as well. So get out of my office and go start writing. Yes, sir. Hey, baby. I've got a surprise for you. Father Escalada gave it to me. She will take care of you while you're asleep. This is gonna be a little bit cold. You gotta be careful, doc. Last time I put something cold on her, she attacked me. I was sleeping and it was your feet. Can you not be so nervous and smile? I'm okay, I'm just worried for Dr. Rum Man. It's Dr. Rumpman. - Oh yeah. - And no attacking the doctor. - Please. - I won't, I promise. I promise. I don't mean to interrupt your romantic moment but we've got an image coming up here and I think you'd like to see it. Oh, my gosh. Baby, look. Wait, that's, is that? Yes, that's your baby's heart. Here, this is the head and this is the torso. Spine looks good. Wow. Do you have any preference, - boy or girl? - No. - Yes - No. - Yes. - No. - Yes. - No, no. - No? - No. No, I'm okay with a girl or a boy as long as everything's fine. Okay, okay, Mr. and Mrs. Martinez. Today's your lucky day. You're getting a baby girl. Yes. We're having a girl. Yes, Uncle? I had this nightmare. They were sacrificing me. To the fire. There was too much rage. But our gods. Calm down, Uncle. It's okay. It's okay. Try to get some rest. Shall I call you Juan now? Yes. I would like that. I like that name. This wound is really bad. Go get the priest. I wanna be baptized. Yes, Uncle. Whatever you say. Have you seen Father Da Gand? Father. Father? Juan Diego. Is everything all right, my son? My uncle, he needs your help. And how can I help? He wants to get baptized. I understand. Allow me to gather my things. We'll be on our way. I can't breathe. I hope... God is always with us. Is that magical? No, it is a rosary. We use it to pray. We do this in honor of Mary, Mother of God. Can you baptize me? Yes. Have you chosen a name? - Juan. - Juan. Is there any other name you like? I don't know others. Would you like Benardino? Bernadino. Yes. He was a very brave man who lived long ago, who stood to help the weak and the sick. Was a warrior? No, a saint. With very strong convictions very much like your own. I baptize you. Juan Bernadino. In the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit. Be strong and have faith, my son. You rest now, you rest. Rest. Juan, we are going to need another bucket of water for your wife. Yes, Father. Your uncle is sleeping. I must go now, but if you need me, you know where to find me, my son. Thank you, Father. My love, I brought you some food. I didn't know you could cook. It won't be as good as yours. I'm sure it's fine. Blisters. They have no lessen. I know. I look awful. No, no, you don't. Don't say that. You're more beautiful every day. Maria, will you marry me? But we are already married. Here. I mean in church. Yes. Every time that you ask me. Yes. Why, why, why! Why? My love, you have to eat. My love for you reaches beyond the sky. I'm falling asleep. Stay with me. Stay with me, Maria. I'll always be with you. Hi, John. Hey, Rosie. - Hi, boss. - Oh, come in. Thank you. Just wanted to stop by to tell you that I'm doing this. No matter what, I'm doing it. And, I also wanted to thank you for being so patient. Juan, don't mention it. So how is the research coming along? Good, great. - Good. - Yeah. Well, listen, I'm glad you stopped by 'cause I have some news. You're giving me a raise? No, no. Michael has left the company. You know he was writing that article on the technology and all that. Oh, and the corporate geniuses thought that it was really great and relevant, but... Actually, I'm sticking with my story. Is there some good material there, John? Yeah, yeah, yeah. How are you coming along with it? You know, I'm still working on that and I'm defining the faith angle. How are you doing that? I've been reading a lot. John, you're not gonna find faith by going to the library and reading books. You got it in you. That's why I gave you this story. I mean, you don't have a laptop or money, but you got faith, John. So don't disappoint me 'cause I'm considering recommending you for Michael's position as senior editor. Thank you. That's what we Latinos do. We work hard. We take care of our families and our friends. I appreciate it. So go on, get out of my office. Hey, boss. Thanks again. Okay, go, go, go, go, go. Uncle. What? Let's go. We're moving. Where are we moving to? To your old house. But this is your home. Not anymore. This place is a ruin. Brings sad memories. Besides, we're not getting any younger. But why to my old home? It's on the other side of the mountain. It is a hill, Uncle. And if you need a doctor, we're gonna be closer to town. You're right. We're not getting any younger. But what is that? It's a donkey. What? It's a donkey. It's a beast. It's not a beast. It's a donkey. Father Da Gand lent it to me. Have you heard from the others? I don't speak to them no more. I think they're still planning on doing more damage. I don't wanna be a part of that. I hope our people come to their senses. I don't see how. How's your wound healing? It's not healing. It still hurts when I breathe. Only reminds me of how I should have taken out those men. But then there would be no difference between you and those men, Uncle. Violence only generates more violence. What matters is your spirit. It's eternal. Never dies. Looks like we're gonna need a new pot. Don't worry, Uncle. I'll get a new one tomorrow. Let's go. How much? Four. This crap isn't worth four. You can't buy it? You can't buy it? You can't buy if you can't pay four. Itchtaca, what's happening? He broke my pot. It slipped from my hand slip. It didn't just slip. I believe he meant no offense. Yes, I meant no offense. Itchtaca, give me two pots. Please, please. Okay. Go in peace. Thank you. Itchtaka. A broken pot is not worth an enemy. My most humble son. I will give you all my love. My compassion, my help, and my protection because I am your merciful mother. The merciful mother of all you who live united in this land. Of those who cry to me or those who seek me. Here, I will hear their weeping, their sorrow. I will remedy their sufferings. My son, go and tell the Bishop to build a temple here in my honor. My lady, I will be happy to carry that message. But, I am sorry, my mother. I'm so sorry but I don't think he'll listen to me. I'm a nobody. I am... I am a small rope. A tiny ladder. A tail-end, a leaf. Why would I ever be heard? Hey, hey, stop. Where do you think you're going, huh? I need to see the Bishop. What business do you have with the Bishop? I have an important message for him. Bishops Zumarraga keeps a very busy schedule. Why don't you tell us? I will ask him if he can make time for you. And who's this message from? From the mother of God. The message is just from the mother of God, huh? Any other voices you hear? Let him go. Sir, he was trying to sneak into the seminary. You're dismissed. Yes, sir. My apologies. You are Juan Yes, my friend. Yes, is I am. I need to talk to a Bishop. What's wrong? I have a message for him. Okay. Follow me. Thank you, Juan. No, thank you. For saving my life. My name is Juan now. Like you. Who's your message from? From the mother of God. I'll see what I can do, my friend. Come. Wait here. Bishop Zumarraga, there's a humble native outside who claims to have an important message for you. Let him in. Come, Juan. You have a message for me? Yes. Captain, thank you. I will speak with him. Thank you, Bishop Zumarraga. Thank you so much for receiving me. And what is your name, my son? Juan Diego Juan, tell me, what is the message you have for me? I just came from the hilltop of Tepeyac. And? Up there, Virgin Mary came to me. She appeared wrapped in stars and she spoke to me in my native tongue. She resembled. A mother goddess. It was Mary. Mother of God. And what was the message she told you? She told me we are to build a temple in her honor. Right in the place where she appeared. I'm sorry, my son. Bishop, I know that I'm just a humble native. But I'm telling you the truth. Juan, my son, if Mary, mother of God, really appeared to you she would have provided proof. Show me the proof that you met her. And then we can talk again about this matter. Yes, Bishop. And now, if you'll excuse me, I have matters to which I must attend. Go with God, my son. Any signs of life, doctor? Your wife is not giving up. You shouldn't give up either. It's hard. Have a little faith. I'll see you later. Uncle? Uncle. Uncle. What's wrong, Uncle? I'm dying, son. No, don't say that. I feel. You won't die. Uncle. I need help. Help. My lady, I stayed faithful. But I've lost my wife. And my uncle is dying. I told the Bishop your message. He says he needs proof from you. I'm sorry, my mother, I have to go. My son, the most humble of all. Don't worry, your uncle will recover and regain his health. You will not need to get any help. I want you to go around the hill and gather flowers for me. Put them in your and bring them to the Bishop as proof you have met me. But it's wintertime, my lady. No flowers grow on this hill. Do not fear me, my son. Who are you? I am your merciful mother. The Lady of Guadalupe. Have you come to take me to the afterlife? My son has seen your sufferings. And I have come to take away all your pain. This wound you carry, will not hurt you anymore. My mother. Look who's here, the messenger. Oh, you again. What do you want this time? I need to see the Bishop. Like I told you before, the Bishop is really busy. Get lost. - He was the one... - Get lost. - I'm sorry. - Yeah. I don't want to bother, I'll come back. Yeah. Crazy fool. - Hey, stop! - Stop! - Stop! - Stop! We must begin planning for the construction. What's going on here? This stubborn native keeps asking to see you. Let him go. He's hiding something. Step away from him now. My son, what are you holding? I brought you proof. Very well, let me see it. I should've been with her, Father. I should have. But I wasn't, Father. Think about the moments you've had together instead of the ones you have not. I've tried. I've tried. Anyway, thank you for coming all the way to me with me here Please tell me what happened after the Virgin appeared in Mexico. Conflict between the natives and the Spanish came to a halt. How come? The word of the Virgin's presence spread. And within 20 years, millions converted. It was almost 90% of those living in the region. We wanna get get Juan Diego canonized. There's some that question whether he even existed. And I guess for some, the faith that brought peace to millions was not proof enough. In my 40 years of research, I really believe that Juan Diego is real. - Mr. Martinez. - Yes? The condition of your wife has worsened. We are moving her to surgery. I need you to come with me please. Her blood pressure's falling! If we keep losing the blood pressure, we're gonna lose the baby! Her heart rate is up! Blood pressure's dropping. She needs to be stable for surgery. Blood pressure's going down. Her heart rate's too high, we gotta go. Operating room better be ready, we're coming in now! Hey baby, hi baby. Hey baby. Baby, I'm here, and I love you, baby. Everything's gonna be fine. Excuse me, sir! Everything's gonna be fine. - I love you, baby. - Sir, sir, you need to wait in the surgical waiting room! Dr. Patel, I'll see you in the OR. Need the crash cart! Clear the door! Uncle. Juan! You are okay. Yes. You won't believe what happened to me. A lady came and cured me. What lady? The mother of God. The Lady of Guadalupe. Our mother. See? She told me she'll take all the pain away. Juan! You just got here. Where are you going? I have to do something. Dr. Flemming. 55450. I always feared that something would go wrong if Mary and I tried to have a baby. Son. It's always the darkest point... And this, Father. This is how my mother died. And I never told any of this to Mary. Never. Excuse me, Mr. Martinez, you need to come with me. Thank you, my mother. Thank you so much. Some find it hard to believe the Virgin will show herself and leave proof for others to see her. Some even say Juan Diego himself is just a legend. The legend of a simple man born a humble native who changed the life of millions and the course of history with nothing but his devout faith. This is how I learned that miracles happen. This is the story of how I became a believer. Come in. Thank you. You have reached the voicemail of John Martinez, please leave a message after the beep. Hi John, this is Father Escalada. I just received a really interesting document. It confirms the existence of Juan Diego. It's a codex from 1548. Give me a call when you have a chance. Thanks, bye. Are we going to light one for mommy? Yep, mommy would love that. I want to do it. You wanna do it? All right. I love you, daddy. There you go, Sophia! I love you both.
