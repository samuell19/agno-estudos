I love the city. I feel inside the life of it... ...because there is always some face, some noise to interest me. It must be because I grew up in the country. A farm we had. And the house was in the middle of a field. Trees and wind and dogs barking was the noises I heard most... ...except for Baba laughing. She's my friend. We went to a convent school together... ...and now we're here in Dublin lodging with Joanna. Our lives vary. Some nights we just lie in our beds... ...and think because we're having a drink that we're getting fast. We go out of course, too. That's what Baba calls real living. - Now you've ruined it. - There's nothing to ruin. Just look. "Such fun, so safe. -"The kiddies love it." -"The fabulous Cradle Bra." - Where did you get all those from? - Free samples. I like my hair plain and simple. You are simple. Give me the brush. - Well, go on, say something. - Certainly not before time. - The picture must be over by now. - We were getting ready. Jump in the old passion wagon. I hope you cleaned it. It had fleas last time. What you doing'? I want to go in front. All right, you get in the front with me, Baba. We're off now. Jan, darling, I'm sorry I'm late. I was afraid you were never going to make it. What will they all think? 1 guess they}! think that we've run away. Darling, we'd better go aboard. - How much time do we have? - A lifetime. Twenty Sweet Afton, please. Thanks, Kate. I have your biscuits, your Brillo... ...and your Rice Krispies. Will that be everything? That's everything, but the vegetables? Willy will bring them up. That's the onions, potatoes and carrots. - Have him up early. - He'll be there as soon as yourself. - Was it 8 ounces? - Yes, make it 8 and cut it thin this time. Last time, it only went between three of us. This ought to do ya. You get a free cup and saucer with this new Andrews tea. I'd rather a decent cup of tea till Friday. Bye, now. - She's gone without her bacon. - Willy can take that. Here, put that down to her account. No rest for the wicked. I think I'll turn this off. It's getting a bit stuffy. You can go on with those accounts, and get Willy to deliver the orders. Righty-o. Two girls got dragged off to Phoenix Park last week... ...so don't accept cigarettes from strangers. They might be doped. I forgot me shoes. What'll I do'? - God, you're right, like an idiot. - But what will I do? You'll cause a sensation, that's what you'll do. Come on. Are you dancing'? I can't. I twisted me ankle. You ought to be careful of that. I did that once. Me foot came up like a balloon. I had to go to the hospital. They kept me in for a fortnight. I expect to meet one of the nurses here, but she hasn't turned up. I wouldn't miss this dance. I come every Sunday. I find it very relaxing after I work late. I work at television servicing. You meet some terrible elements. You know, last week I went out to Mayo. This woman showed me in, I saw the TV, took it down. Immediately said, "That's the oscillation transformer and the line base is gone." I told her that it would be Â£3 to repair. She said that was no good. I said, "Or leave it. "Do you know that any time your output-circuit transformer could blow?" - Raymond. - The very person... Excuse me. Doped cigarettes? Did he make free with me? Oh, not much Father. Did he what? No, he just rubbed me leg. I'd rather risk Hell than the penance he gave me. You're halfway there already. Girls, let's go! Come on! I'm going up the Dublin Mountain. It's Bertie. Where are you off to'? Come on, get in before I'm arrested. - You're not going to dog trials, are you? -Indeed, I'm not. I'm taking this thoroughbred up, a cracked man wants to train him backwards. I'll be getting £10, I hope. We'll have a few jars later. That's a bit brighter. For Pete's sake, get a move on. This yoke is not taxed. Hurry up round the back. Pull it down as hard as you can. Don't let the dog out, whatever you do. - Are we there? - Yup, this is it. I hope he has real money. It'll be too late to cash a check. There goes our bright evening. If we're stuck, we can sell our bodies to the College of Surgeons. Another of my jokes, she's always doing that. Hang on. I won't be a minute. Come on, doggy, your new hotel. Wait for me, will ya? There's nothing but bloody horseflies and cow dung. It's ruining the country. - Keep watch while I water the grass. - Righty-o. Baba! Hello, can I help? We've brought a dog. Mr. Counham's gone in with it. Hello! - Is there a girls' school here? - My name is Miss Brennan. This is my friend, Miss Brady. Well, I better go and see Mr. Counham. Why didn't you help me keep him here? How? You get him interested in your bust or the scenery or something. You just don't know how to attract men. You look like a dog's dinner. Great ghast, you're just jealous anyway. What of, you great bean pole? - No. - Lanky! You little squid. - Bumps in all the wrong places. - You got no bumps at all. Thank you, Mr. Counham. Good-bye, Mr. Gaillard, and thank you very much. - Come on, get in, my lovely girl. - What's the hurry? There's no hurry, but get in quickly all the same. Don't take all day. Are the doors closed at the back'? Good. What's his name? Eugene Gaillard. I got me money anyhow. Not even a cup of water. Bet he's a foreigner. What does he do'? He does sweet damn all. He wrote some book about the bloomin' savages in Africa. He lived out there, I think. Come on out of this morgue. Haven't you been in here long enough'? Tender Is the Night, that's a dark title. - Tender is me feet that are killing me. - Shut up. I'm away next door to see what genuine bargains I can pick up. I don't want to be sent to Devil's Island for wearing no knicks. I'll take these two, please. Put them on my account. Hello, how's your dog? Very well, thank you. - You'll like that. It's melancholic. - Yes, I've read some of his before. Enjoy it. Hello. Me, I'm absolutely used to it. I must tell you this marvelous thing that happened to me at Killarney Races. Kate wasn't there anyway. I met this man and he looked at me and he said, "I want to propose to you." And then, the next morning, I came downstairs and there he was. He said, "Are you a nurse or something? Your face looks familiar." Does she always go on like this? Would you join us for a cup of tea? We're having one. - I have to meet a man. - About a dog? Come on. All right, a quick cup. We always have tea when we're shopping. Makes such a change, don't you think? Bertie says you write about savages. Savages? I haven't always lived here. I have written some books. Really? Are you writing one now? - So you're a cosmopolitan. - Homeless. Not now. I'm doing translations for an American publisher. America'? That's where we wanted to go. In school, we wrote to Gary Cooper. "Dear Gary Cooper," we said. "We admire you and we have blue and green eyes, respectively. "Please send us some money to get out of here." And which of you has green and which blue? She has blue. It was a convent, great ghast. How exciting. So you're convent girls. - Do you wear holy medals? - She's covered in them. No, I'm not. How long were you there? Five years. We'd still be there now if it weren't for me. One day in chapel, I had a great idea. "I'll get Mother Superior to expel us," I thought. So I got this holy picture, and I left it in the chapel where Sister would find it... ...and on the back I'd written about Father Darcis... I'd love to hear about it, but I have to go. - Already? -I'm afraid. Good-bye. Good-bye. Snow melts. - Do you want anything else, madam? - No, thank you. Yes? Hello. I'm hope you didn't come into Dublin especially. Well, it's not every day that I get asked to tea. Baba's so sorry she can't come, but she has a terrible headache. I'm sorry. Sit down. What'll ya have'? I invited you. -I'd like tea and toast. - They have beans on toast. No. Tea and toast for two, and some cakes please. - Buttered toast? - Yes, please. Right. Do you live all by yourself in that big house? Not altogether. I have a woman that comes in every now and again. She tells me all the gossip and cooks me bacon and cabbage. In an inadvertent moment I thought I'd like to sample bacon and cabbage and... ...I've been having it solidly ever since. When I was at the convent, we had cabbage a lot... ...and one day there was a slug in mine. I wouldn't eat it. "Eat your cabbage," the nun said to me. "There's a fly in it, Sister," I said. I didn't like to say "slug." All the girls laughed and I was put to stand in the refectory. Barbarous. Where do your family live? My mother's dead, and my father lives down in the country. Baba comes from the same place. Her father is a vet. And where do you work? I'm in a grocery shop, and Baba's at secretarial college, but... Is that all right? Yes. That's fine, thank you. But what? But I'm thinking of studying to be something else. I know, a tubercular heroine dying of love. I was going to ask you about the books you write... ...and if I could read one. Well, a bit aseptic for your tastes, I think. I'd still like to read one. All right. We could meet next week. Can we rely on Baba to have a pain in her head again? Was America nice? Nice? No. I'd say it rather frightened me. All those blue skies and tanned faces. You talk of places as if you were always alone in them. Yes. My mother always said I was born to be a monk. It sounds very Irish. She was. In her teens, she ventured abroad as a tutor. My father was a Hungarian. Was he a gypsy? No. You'd like that, wouldn't you? My father has a farm. - What's he like? - I don't know. It's hard to describe people. If I went to tell about you, what would I say'? I hate to think. Is he reasonable? We don't say much. I tell Baba everything, except about you. I'm fated to get girls in pairs. I suppose a lot of girls have been in love with you. A couple. Were they very sophisticated? They thought they were. You are a mixture of innocence and guile. What's guile? That chiffon scarf. That was a danger signal. I said to myself, "She's got more than tea on her mind." I hadn't, honestly. Tell me, why did you invite me to tea? Because you had that look of mystique on your face. Mystique? You'd better stop reading books. Why did you come? The imponderable questions. Why did I shave myself... ...put on a tie, get my car out, drive 17 miles... ...to see a girl that I hardly knew'? To study savages, I suppose. You're not sorry, are you? I'm not sorry, Kate. I don't want to get involved. I suppose it's my puritanical caution. - You're a nice girl. - But... I'm twice your age. We have different upbringings, tastes, everything. I don't want to get involved. But you're not involved. I don't intend to get married, ever. It's not marriage that I fear. It's passion, emotion... ...a need to tie people up. When I listen to you talking, it's like reading a book. When I look at you listening, it worries me. You're like a lemur. Have you ever seen one? It's a beautiful night animal with big, hungry eyes. You know what lights remind me of'? Of all the people in the world waiting for... ...all the other people to come to them. "A girl stood before him in midstream... "...alone and still, gazing out to sea." James Joyce. I always think you're not waiting for anyone. Maybe not. "Why can't it always be dark, when your brown eyes whisper lies... "...that the phenomenal heart afterwards denies." Young girls fill me with such sadness. They want so much. I want nothing. "Mrs. White had a fright In the middle of the night "Saw a ghost eating toast Halfway up the lamp post" I'm a lemur! Hooray! You're just in time. Is my hair all right? Eugene is here. I was to meet him, but I'm late. He was waiting for a half hour. "Come in," says I. "Delighted," says he. - You have no shoes. - Not with this outfit. You waggle your toes at the men. They love it. Toodle-oo. Joanna, don't put that plastic cloth over the other one... ...or tell him how hard up you are. I not invite him. I'm not good enough. "I wonder," says she. "Can you help me? I have a big wash on Mondays... "...my husband makes love to me on Sunday nights... "...and I'm dog tired. What should I do?" "Wash on Tuesdays." Hello. Hello. I didn't know you'd arrived. Mary, mother of sorrow. Since when have you been showing cleavage'? It's just tea we're having. She's flopping all over the place. Call Arthur. Tell him tea's poured. Arthur, the tea. He's the other lodger. I bet he's upstairs now, dousing himself with hair oil. - He fancies our Kate, you know. - Really? Truly. He buys her choicy biscuits, sits on them in boxes... ...and hands 'em to her squashed. Here we are. I made a lovely pudding with lots of raisins in... ...for your nice new friend. My own, homemade, from a good old Austrian recipe. Good evening. Arthur, this is my friend, Mr. Gaillard. - Hello. - Pleased to meet you. For my special friend. No, thank you. I'll just have tea. - Is the tea nice? - Breathtaking. I must tell you about the day I was having my tea in a restaurant downtown. I say, you've just met the man. "L don't like your cracked plate," said I to the waitress. "Don't be so ignorant," says she. "That's your rasher." Arthur, his dad from the country and two cousins... ...took Kate and I out after a football match... ...and his dad did the ordering. "We'll have tea and meat for the men..." ...says he, "and confectionery for the ladies." It was the other way round. But you shouldn't talk so much, you should concentrate on the flavor. I always say, no tea party's complete without rely-poly pud. - Here you are. - I don't want any. Yes, but you should for the nourishment. I borrowed a cigarette holder today because that mope went and... I'll have to go and change now. - Are you all right? - I got a bit wet. Don't worry. I wanted you to be so impressed. lam. There are no innocent girls, they're all like Baba with guile in their eyes. You're beginning to talk like me. Where are we going? Out. -Isn't it hot? - Yes, I wish you didn't have to go back. What's the time? I'm late. We must hurry. Eugene! Well, squire, I thought I recognized the noble profile. It's been months. How are you? Gracing Dublin with your presence? How are you? I'm fine, struggling with the muses. How interesting. Did you ever finish that piece of writing? I haven't started it yet. Well, you're looking very well anyway. How's the wife? All right, thank you. I've been so busy I haven't seen you. Why don't you drop in-- I'm sorry, I really am very late. I'm sorry. I must go. Who's that little fawn from the bogs? You're in holy Ireland. You shouldn't be meddling with infants. Drogheda 85. Hello? Who do you want? Me or Mr. Gaillard? Hello? You're going to sit and drool over your misery. God, you'd make a marvelous hard mourner. - What did he say his wife's name was? - I don't know. Bet she's 80 and got a moustache. I'll make inquiries. Well, you won't get far in this outfit, that's one thing... ...without a bit of help. "I wish, I wish, I wish in vain, I wish I was a child again "But that I know will never be Till apples grow on a willow tree" Kate! It's the telephone. Hello? Hello, Kate? This is Eugene. Hello. I thought you mightn't be speaking to me, so I gave you some time to decide. Decide what? H you're coming to visit me tomorrow. I don't know. Please yourself. Don't come if you don't fee! you ought to. I don't know, really. Come on, make up your mind. We'll be cut off in five more seconds. All right, so I'll come. H! pick you up about 10:00. All right, meet me on the corner, otherwise they'll all want to come. Maybe they should. It sounds as if we'll need jollying up. Good-bye, love. Hello. You look like a child bride in that hat. Yes. I had it on at Mass. Do you think it's suitable for the wicked day which lies ahead? "0 Angel of God, be at my side, to light and guard, to rule and guide.â€œ All right, outwith it. Tell me I'm a cruel, crooked, deceitful bastard. Sorry, Kate. I didn't want you to hear my history on the street like that. - Will she be there? - No, she won't be there. Is she dead? Not quite. She's living in America. - When is she coming home? - She's not. - Who was it that answered the phone'? -It must have been Josie. You know, the one who cooks bacon and cabbage. You look so nice, you deserve a kiss. I wrote something about your round face. Not as poetic as yours, but it'll do. "Your face may be round, but your heart is quite pure... "...and girls with pure hearts get fewer and fewer." It's lovely. Kate, get the parcels out of the back, will you? - Is that all? - Yes. Sorry. Our mutual friend. - What did you call him? - Kim. I'll put these in the kitchen, then I'll show you around. Hello. Hello. Josie, this is Kate Brady... ...who has come to the country in a ridiculous pair of shoes. How do you do, indeed? - I guess you'll want a dinner. - If you can manage it by 6:00. - I hope this is booze. - It is. - Can you cook? - Yes. You may have to. I indulge her tantrums on Sunday. That's the guest room straight ahead... ...and my bedroom is down the hall. I don't use the others. - Where do you work? - When I do, in the big room downstairs. Lovely dishes, aren't they? Laura took most of the good stuff with her: Prize china and things. - Was that Mrs. Gaillard? - Yes, she was a smasher. She looked as well without makeup as with it. He took a picture of her one day out in the yard, without lipstick. It would win a beauty competition. I miss her. This house isn't the same. It's a nice house. A devil to keep clean. Now that we don't have any big parties, I have no interest in keeping it up. Kate, we're going now. I'd better be off. We're going for a walk. He's a great one for walking. - What are you doing'? -I'm getting ready for a party. So Josie's been regaling you with stories about the good old days. Sort of. Do you miss Laura'? Yes. You can miss somebody you dislike. Why is she not coming back'? Because she's gone to Reno to get a divorce. She doesn't want a husband. She wants a social success... ...a millionaire, a father, a psychoanalyst... ...anybody for golf. Was she like that when you got married? People don't really see each other until they get married. While we're still friends, what are you thinking? - Won't we always be friends? - Not if we become lovers. Well, then we won't become lovers. All right, back to the convent with you. I've had enough cabbage. Tell me three things about you that'll stop me... ...inviting you to my house again. I bite my nails, and I'm not sophisticated, and... And you're jealous. Because I've got green eyes? What does this remind you of'? Rain. - Do you like it? - I like music with words. -I'm off now. I'll see you tomorrow. - Good night, Josie. The dinner was lovely. Good-bye, I hope I see you again sometime. So the sinister housekeeper retires... ...leaving the strange, troubled girl alone. I'm not sure that I'm staying. Aren't you? I'm certainly not driving you back at this time of night. -I'll get you to the shop in the morning. - Will it be all right? Kate, you soft, daft, wanton thing... ...did you know that you are mad in one eye and therefore have no sense? Good night. - It was a nice day. - It was. - Staying out in his house again? - I may. You know very well you are. You're going to find yourself trouble. You're the one that used to talk about me being out late in cars. If Joanna finds out you're not here, she won't half make a stink. She won't. She's like Eugene, she doesn't worry about the narrow conventions. Narrow conventions? So he'll never marry you. It's not marriage that ties people together. It's emotion, need. That's youth. - What is? - What you're doing. Picking things up and dropping them again. Hairpins, feelings, anything. Well, it's only a stick. Only a stick, only a person. I'm not like that. It's the other way around. I always stay fond of people. What maddens me is you take someone to tea... ...and you meet them on the street and they hardly say hello. Well, that's different. Everybody has their off days. They have indigestion, hangover. If I like people, I like them always. Impossible. There is no "always" in human relations. You like people, but you don't always have to meet them. I often cross the road to avoid somebody I like. That's daft. Would you cross the road in a year's time to avoid me? Who knows? I might be dead or different. People die, change, outgrow their best friends. Nothing's permanent. Can I come next weekend? I'll probably have forgotten you by then. Where are you off to now? Come back! Good night. It was a nice day. It was. If Mother Superior could see you now... I expect she can. Shall we go to bed? Isn't it a bit early? Perhaps you'd better take your boots off. Try the beech out in there. In the convent, we had to undress under a dressing gown. If it fell off, we got killed. In this monastery, we have built-in shelters. I have no night dress. Here. - Whose is it? - Mine. Kate Brady, the girl with one mad eye... ...what are you doing in my bed? I don't know what I'm doing. Why are you shivering? Just the strangeness. We're not strange. I'm sorry, I'd be like this even if we were married. I do love you. It's not that I don't love you. I know. Try and go to sleep. What's wrong'? Where are you going? -I'm just going for a stroll. -I'll come. No, you rest. I often go for a walk by myself at dawn. You're leaving me. I'm sorry, Eugene. Don't keep saying you're sorry. It makes it sound like a road accident. Even married couples go through this... ...at least 5% of them anyway. Eugene! Getting ready for the next orgy? Yes, I'm a fast woman. Look, this kid's nice. All right, get in. I'm sorry. Don't be cross. Nobody's cross. You're different to me. Everybody's different at 7:30 on a Monday morning. Good morning, Mr. Gaillard. I found a child's book this morning. Whose is this? I have a daughter. I didn't know you had. Yes. - Do you miss her'? - Of course. Everything will be better next week. I know it will. I meant to tell you, I have to go to London for a week or two. Will you write to me? I'll send you a postcard. Well, I'd better go in. - Good-bye. - Bye. Friends, Romans, folkmen... ...I come to bury Eugene, not to praise him. The evil that he did pines after him. You're getting duller every day. I know. That's all right, thanks. I want to get some tea, too, please. Take it yourself there, Mrs. Dolan. - And what can I do for you, Pat? - A quarter of tea. A quarter of tea. And a turnover. I haven't a turnover. Will a sliced pan do ya? Yes, that's all right. Exactly right. Dadder, what are you doing here? You can get out from behind that counter, me girl. We've got plans for you. And pass me down one of those bottles. It's my father and uncle Andy. Never mind the fancy manners, just do what your father tells ya. There's not much future in this place, and we want something stronger than that. Not here, I'll meet you later. We're busy. Busy? And what do you think I'm here for? Listen to this: "Dear Mr. Brady... "It was high time you knew about your daughter... "...and the company she keeps. "For over two months now... "...she's having to do with a divorced man." To tell you the truth, Mr. Brady, I've noticed a lot of things lately. "Signed, a friend." -It's not true. - Where does this blackguard live? We'll disable him, that's one thing. We'll burn his house down around his ears. Who do you think you are to talk about someone superior? Watch your language, me girl. God, I hope we can all keep our tempers! Get your coat. You're coming with us. -I'll do no such thing. - By God, you will. - I won't! - Get your coat when you're told. If her poor mother was only alive, she'd turn in her grave! Clear to Christ, if it isn't Jimmy Brady! Andy, will you look who's here? You're looking great, Jimmy, not a day older. - This calls for a celebration. - Stoke. Tell me, how is every bit of ya? And where ya heading for? I was up in Dublin. That little girl of mine got into hot water, and I had to rescue her. There she is over there. You've known her since she was a lassie. That's a fine girl, Jimmy, and so why shouldn't she be? She has a decent father. Where are you going? I'm going to the ladies' room. A very natural requirement, James. Come on inside. Your aunt is waiting for ya. Good night, Johnny, and mind yourself going home. I said, "Kate would die rather than do a thing like that." His wife has left him. He's still married. He's going to get a divorce. Divorce'? It's worse than murder, far worse. Are you sure there's nothing wrong with you? No. There isn't. It's a good thing we got you home in time. I'm going to bed. I'll talk to you again in the morning. Katie, come back here! I know where you're going. They're expecting me back at work. I promised Mrs. Byrne. Don't mind Mrs. Byrne. She and I fixed up all that between us. Look, there's lots of jobs you could be doing here. I'll get you a job in Limerick. I've lots of influence over there. I must go back and get my clothes from Joanna's house. Katie, child... I'm longer in the world than you are, and I know right from wrong. Come on and help me find the rest of the cows. I've been brewing things over in me mind. I just thought that if we pulled our socks up... Katie, there's someone to see you. There you are, Kathleen. - Hello, Father Byrne. -It's nice to have you back with us again. I never like to see the boys and girls go away, draining the countryside. Well, tell me all about yourself. Nothing much, Father. The country looks lovely at this time of year, doesn't it? You must be very happy to be back home again. I'm just home for a while from Dublin. For a while? I see. Well now, Kathleen, your aunt has told me... ...the whole shocking story about this business in Dublin. This man is dangerous company. He has no faith, no morals. Now, you'll have to stop seeing him, Kathleen... ...and stay at home here with your father. Father's all right. Auntie looks after him and he has his drinking friends. That's a different matter. A man needs a drink. It's the climate. You are in a state of mortal sin. You have committed the sin of adultery. You must go to confession now and beg God's forgiveness. Come now, Kathleen, no more prevarication. God is testing your love. He has sent this man across your path to tempt you... ...so you can reaffirm your love for Him. Now, you must give me your oath... ...that you will never see this man again. No! - When's the next train to Dublin? - You'll have to wait here for two hours... ...and then get the local train to the junction... ...and then maybe you'll catch the midnight train from Cork. 30 shillings, please. Thank you. Baba, it was awful. Mary, mother of sorrows. Everyone kept telling me how wicked I was. They brought a priest. I thought I'd never get away. You better watch out. Your old man will be after you. Lucky Eugene wasn't here. They'd have murdered him. He's back. Since when? Did he call to see me? Came out a couple nights ago. But he went away again when I told him the news. I wonder what that means. Well, there's one way to find out. Here, pack your belongings. You can't go to him with things in your fist. He mightn't want me there now. Try it. They say helpless women always appeal to men. Not that I'd know. - What'll we do about my father? -I'll send him a telegram. "I'm just preg. On the way to London. Drop dead. Kate." I wonder what'll happen. Kate. I'm sorry. I had to come. I heard all about it from Baba. I ran away. I thought I'd never see you again. Dear Kate... Do you know I actually missed you when I was in London? Baba sent them a telegram telling them I've gone to London. That will keep them quiet for a day or two. I don't know. They'll murder me if they find me here. - We won't let them murder you. - You don't know them. A Jehovah's Witness was stabbed in 29 places... ...with a tin opener in the village next to ours. Nonsense. Sit down. If you're that nervous, I should've taken you to the airport tonight. Can't we lock all the doors? Nonsense, you're being melodramatic. All I want is peace... ...and you're roaming around with your teeth chattering. You'll have some peace when I've gone. Don't feel wronged. I'm not abandoning you to the wolves. You can stay in London a couple of weeks... ...and then come back when everybody's calmed down. I don't want to leave you. I don't want you to leave. You brighten up this hermitage. I'm just being sensible. All right. It's only a fox. - Will you write to me? - Every day. Big, long letters. This is beyond endurance. I'll go and to talk to him. Don't tell him I'm here. - Where's Kathleen? - I trust you'll forgive this intrusion. I regard myself as the voice of maturation. - A divorced man. - This is my house. You're trespassing! Now look, she's not in Dublin, and if she's not there, she's here. Show me your house and I'll tell you what ya are. God Almighty. Come in, do. Now, men, please, let's all sit down and we'll ruminate-- I suppose you know what class of a business it is... ...for an old man to bring young girls to his house... ...to interfere with them. - Where is she? - Are you a Catholic? Are you a heathen? Produce the girl here, or else we'll search the house. Go home and we'll discuss the whole thing tomorrow. - What the hell do you take us for? - It's our country. I've said all I'm going to say. Now, will you please get out of my... And there's another in case you don't get out. Come on! These people could kill you! Savages! Get out! - Are you hurt? -I'm not sure. You are lucky, sir, they didn't kill you. I had more than luck, Josie. I had you. I'll get hot water and Jay's fluid. Never mind Jay's fluid. Wait till they get a letter from my solicitor. I think I managed all right, sir. At least I didn't lose me head. - It was awful. - It was ridiculous. I'm still here. Haven't you been to sleep? No. I kept guard for the savages. - All night? - It's 4:30. You moaned in your sleep. Are you all right? I'm a bit bruised. I only wanted to say something and then go. Like what? Now you're awake, I don't know. - Will you drive me to the airport? - No. Really? We'll stay for a day or two. Anyway, if I'm moaning in my sleep, who's going to comfort me? Some other bird. There aren't any girls with such a nice face... ...and such a thrillingly awful family. You were the one who said I had to go. It's done now. You're eternally damned... ...and I've lost any respectability I had. Anyway, you'd get lost over there. Wolves. I don't want to stay if you feel sorry for me. You want an ardent proposal? Come here. Well, we've got the ring even if we haven't had the ceremony. That'll have to last you along time. - How long? - As long as you keep your girlish laughter. Do you promise to love, honor, obey and support me... ...till cheerlessness do us part? -L will. - All right. With this ring, I thee bed and board... ...for such time as you remain reasonable and kind. Amen. - Could you look after these for me? - Certainly. No, that's too much altogether. It's all right. I just got married today. Such a young girl. Madame. I feel so sophisticated. To love. To simplicity. To you. To us. - For ever after. - For while we're happy. Can I keep the cork'? Gathering up a past? It's a nice past. It's lovely. "ConsommÃ(Copyright), cod, corn, caviar, cockles, cookies... "...colcannon, corned beef, coffee, carrots, curry, catmint, cabbage..." Jesus. Kate, have you taken my fountain pen again? It's here. I wish people wouldn't keep using it, I can't write with it anymore. Where'? Thank you. - Haven't you finished yet? -I'll never be finished. Boeuf en casserole avec pommes purÃ(Copyright)e, surtout Ã Ia Katie. - It's cottage pie. - That's what I said. Why are you sad today? Well, it's Sunday and I didn't go to Mass. - Will you take me next Sunday? - I might, if I'm up. Treachery. - I thought you said you could cook. - I can. Baba taught me. Never put that much garlic in anything. Just a tiny piece, at most. Don't you believe in God? I do when I'm driving a car at 80 miles an hour. It varies. I don't want to go to church by myself. All right, I'll take you... ...as far as the porch. Have a nice Mass'? I forgot that you were waiting for me. Isn't that funny'? No, it isn't funny. In there, you become a convent girl again. Deep in it: crucifixes, bleeding hearts, Hell. And I'm outside reading about atomic bombs. How can you endure it? I was never a convent girl. Are we going to have one of your emotional blubberings? No. It's just that it's extraordinary. You're not the same girl that strews hairpins all over my study floor. In there, you revert to barbaric origins. I like Mass and God and good things. And when I don't go, I feel the goodness going out of me. - I know you hate it. - I don't hate it. It just perplexes me. Here, smell this. A flower of May for a girl of May. It's not all this, or the New Statesman, that unite two people. Come on, I'll by you a drink and wash away all that sanctity you've just acquired. Kate? I'm here. Come on, Mary and Malachi are here. He's that awful man we met once in the street. Pay no attention to him. Some girl laughed at his manhood once and he's never forgotten it. Who's Mary? Just a friend. What will I do'? Who'll you say I am? I'll say you're Kate Brady, a guest for summer. He's taken down all Laura's paintings. Beast. I heard that. I didn't want to live with muddy canvases. This is Kate, whom I think you've met. Briefly. She danced away like the morning dew. How do you do'? Mary Maguire. - How do-- - Hi. - Kate, would you get some tea? - Won't you sit down? Just in time. Allow me. I can manage. Shall I finish buttering these for you? I always seem to butter bread in this stately home. "Werther had a love for Charlotte such as words could never utter. "Would you know how first he met her'? She was cutting bread and butter." Has he you baking bread with compost-grown flour? Josie buys the bread in the village. So you're Lord Ireland's little daughter. I heard your family brought hatchets to bear on poor old Eugene. Stories in Ireland always get exaggerated. It'll give Laura a good laugh... ...when she hears about it. What a sweet, little tray cloth. Was it a wedding gift? I suppose you look on this as your honeymoon. "Honeymoon: the time during which the bride believes... "...the bridegroom's word of honor." Quotation: H.L. Mencken, born 1880... ...editor, critic, biographer, lexicographer... ...and sadist. You're a clever girl. I see you have a clever tear in your eye. Now, I'm a poet and I know these things. Tell me, Kate... You don't mind me calling you Kate, do you? What do you really think about Eugene and his translations? I'm sure they're very good. A little insignificant, you must admit. He says it doesn't matter what you do, so long as you have conviction. Isn't that lovely? His greatest achievement is that he talks with such solemnity. He's a man of conscience. The milk of human blindness. You know his greatest ambition? To write an epic that'll make money on the VistaVision screen. - You know nothing about him. - His face is filled with broken best-sellers. Don't shoot fish. You're as Harper's Bazaar as ever. Not "bazaar," "bizarre." Bizarre, shmizarre. What does it matter? I'm pretty. Shall I be mother? Auntie, rather. Kate, you've brought the wrong cups. Heathcliff, you're looking quite virile, all things considered. Against all the laws of nature. You're looking younger, if such a thing is possible. Shall we retire to the grotto? I'm beginning to feel a little out of things in here. Havel told you about our trip over to the West? Where the Irish protest is much in evidence on ditches and walls. It was marvelous. So windy and primitive. Good, I'm glad you got rid of your penthouse obsessions. And this woman there had a face like a retired Brunnhilde. And I can tell you, there were no chinks in her armor. They caught a shark and we ate it. We swam at night. - Even the police thought it was fun. - When they arrived. - It's just as well for you they did. - I don't know. Listen, next time, why don't we all go up there? You and Malachi and me, and whatever's left of the Trinity pack. I'll just get some hot water. I don't think I'd relish what's left of the old Trinity pack. You never know what might happen when you get down there. Eugene, thanks so much for having us. The tea was marv. Kate, are you in one of your emotional states? You'll be happy, they're gone. - That must be sad for you. - What does that mean? You seem to enjoy their clever conversation so much. It's not a case of whether I enjoy it or not. It's just the sad old games that they play. Anyway, it's good to have articulate friends out here... ...even friendly enemies. You made so little of me in front of them, all that talk about Laura. It's natural, she was Laura's friend, the same way that Baba's yours. They went everywhere together, to Europe... He writes and tells her everything... ...and I suppose you'll write her and tell her everything, too. I'd like her to have the authentic version. Why do you write to her at all if it's all over between you? Nothing is ever quite "over," as you put it. You want to stay married to her'? It's immaterial to me... ...but being unmarried seems to trouble your country soul. You didn't do one thing to show you love me. What do you expect me to do, sing you a Hungarian opera? I don't know. Kate, I honestly don't think I can do it. I can't start from scratch on a purely simple level. There's not enough time left in the world anymore. I like it when it's just us. It's not just us, unfortunately. Then the Malachi fellow asked Eugene about me father coming over and sneered. You should have sat there, as brazen as a pig, puffing fags. This morning, this telegram arrived. "Well, everyone deserves a little fun now and then. Enjoy yourself writing. "Love, Laura." She's a right clip. - Lucky he was out when it arrived. - You ought to bribe the postman. There'll be big sob stuff coming up soon. What'll I do? Stuff 'em in the boiler. If he leaves me, I'll die. I wouldn't like to be like that. Fancy free, that's me. I've got exciting news to tell you. I'm off to London next week. No. Yes, I'm off on Tuesday. Can you loan me Â£20? Don't go. I want to. I'm sick to death of this hick town... ...and those slobs learning to be secretaries, and rely-poly pudding... ...and men with damp hands up me thighs. I have no one to turn to. What about the cash? Can you manage? It was worth it letting you dive into a life of iniquity. "His brown eyes whisper lies." Well, of course Mary wrote. She said you had a little backwoods girl who': shy and thorny. Darling, don't rush into anything. You're wise and M! o! talent and I must help you. The ticket is a gift from me to you. I think I owe it to you to have a long talk. Besides, you'll see Boo and me and the sunshine. Al! my love, Laura. Chapter 9 of the drama. You're opening my letters now. Good job I did, I'd waken up some day and find you gone. In what way? There's an air ticket for you. She's getting generous. That's no way to talk. She says I'm thorny. You're not exactly benign. You're not going to go, are you? Are you? I don't know. I'd have to think about it. What about me? One relationship doesn't cancel out another. I have a child there. I might like to see her. It's nothing to do with you. But it has. If you go to them, it means you don't love me. And you're the girl who said, "I want nothing." But you like me in bed and everything. Please. - I don't know what I'm doing here then. - I don't know either. I think I'd be better off if I'd never met you! I liked you better before you started thinking. You're the one who's always urging change and things. When I met you the first few times in Dublin... ...I thought to myself, "Here's a simple girl, gay as a bird... "...delighted if you pass her a second cake." I might be like that again. You never were like that. It was an illusion. Young girls are like stone. Nothing really touches them. It's not true. I'd do anything for you. Apparently, that's why we're having this lovely conversation. Only, I don't want you to go to them. I don't! - I haven't said I was going. - Well, decide now! I have to lunch in town today. Do you think we can postpone the scene'? Can I come? All right. I'll be a while getting ready. I'm just going in to comb my hair. You do that. I'll be in the lounge. Could you give this to Mr. Gaillard? He's in the lounge. Certainly. Tell him Miss Brady won't be joining him for lunch. Maybe you ought to go to the hotel and see him for me. I wanted to get on with my packing. Anyway, what would I say'? Tell him I'm here. Supposin' he says, "That's great." He won't. He wants me back. I know he does. When I was small and lived on the farm... ...my mother was always leaving my father. It didn't last for long, though. After a while, he'd always go back to her and ask her to come back to him. Bloomin' men. You never know what they're up to. What did you say in the letter? I don't know. Things. That I was going to England with you. Why don't you? We'll have a whale of a time. -I'm sure he wouldn't want me to leave. - All right, I'll go and see him. God grant he's there, I want to borrow some more money. - Was he there? - Yeah, I caught him at the door. What did he say'? Well, stay there. I'm coming in. Well, I told him you were here and that you're coming to England with me... ...and all that sort of bluff. He didn't say anything for along while, but he looked awful. Where is he now? He's gone home. Without me? He said it was probably the best thing. And he wishes he could feel young and intense, and cry the way you cry. I'll go to him now. I'll do anything. No, he says you have to stay here till, perhaps, you've grown up a bit. He said old men and young girls are all very well in books... ...but not anywhere else. Don't tell me any more. He didn't say anything more. Jesus, don't go off your head or have a nervous breakdown. He must come back to me. You know what? Come upstairs and have a gin and tonic. Lucky I have some. He'll come back. He's just giving you a day or two to cool off. I think he's cracked, and he should have been a monk. She's coming out at last. - Did you talk to him? - There was no reply. In two weeks, you'll have forgotten about it. Don't worry. Please do write us. God bless you. - Bye. - Bye bye. Bless you. Don't forget your case. That's it. Lucky I brought the pills. We don't want to puke up all over the damn ship. I wonder where he is. - Good-bye. - Good-bye. Good-bye, Bertie. - Don't forget us. - Good-bye! - Bye. - Good-bye, me loves. Me two lovely girls. Baba, do I look like a woman with a past? No, just a right looking eejit. Come on, let's stop moping and join this lot. He wrote to me in London saying what a nice girl I was... ...and what a pity that he hadn't been younger or I hadn't been more mature. I haven't heard now for months, so I expect he': gone back to his wife. Once or twice, I've seen someone who looks like him... ...and I run to them the way I'd run to kiss him if he appeared now. Ifs funny. 1 remember all the things we talked about. He said once, â€We all leave one another. â€We die, we change, we outgrow our best friends.â€œ ifs true, because 1 have changed. I go to school at night, meet different people, different men.
