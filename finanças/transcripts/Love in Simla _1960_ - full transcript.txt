Lucky girl... ...will be elected as Miss Shimla tomorrow. She has a radio, a tape recorder and… ...a three-year contract from Filmalaya, Bombay. My God! What is going on? I have been president here for twenty-five years. Apparently, this year… ...a revolutionary is here. A person who wants to destroy Indian beauty. If this happens again, I will arrest him. Oh my God. Close the doors. Miss Dev Kumar Mehra I will teach you a lesson. This is very disgusting behavior. This is a great insult, sir. Who do you think I am? Do you think I am a revolutionary or an anarchist? Stay away. Do not touch me. I didn't know I had them. Ladies and gentlemen, here are the crackers! Dev, you are dangerous. I wanted to celebrate Diwali. - I... - Shut up. Take these crackers and leave here. You burn them all outside. I'm sorry sir. go out - who is? - I am...

I tried to avoid him but he wouldn't go back. God came for me. People laugh at me now. They mock me. Our family is said to be a strange family. Sister, with sister's boyfriend... ...They say we are shameless. Your mother is a chaste woman. You seduce your sister's boyfriend. Be quiet, Sheila. I will protect that mother. One does not do that.

I, make him a hater. I convince him… ...that I am mean and evil. how is that I tend to flirt with others. He will love you more. I dance with others and don't look at him.

Can I use the mic? - Certainly. - Thank you. ladies and gentlemen! Sonia performed very well on stage. She acts well in real life too. I present this radio to her. Wherever I am, this gift will remind me of you. I hold it close to my heart. - Thank you, Dev. - Okay. Sheila, you are crying over something stupid. Vijaya, I was running after fame instead of love. I got neither love nor fame. Why don't you tell Dev that you had a fight with Sonia... So she accepted the challenge of winning his heart. He loves Sonia. Sonia just wants to win the bet. She does not love him. - It's too late now, Vijaya. - It's not late. Poor Dev, I pity him. If you can't I will tell him everything. Is Sheela telling the truth? come with me I'm sad to tell you the truth. what are you doing now I will take care of it. Hello, Sonia. Hello, Dev. You left without meeting me. I couldn't even congratulate you. What a beautiful presentation! How did you change overnight? I wonder who that girl I met was. Fell in love for it. who are you I didn't recognize you. I remember. love in your eyes The love in your words... ...and your honesty. I couldn't help you. Sonia, if this happened to every girl who met a guy... ...how does he live? You and I understand what love is. Some for fun, some for fame... Some love money. Some like to win a bet. We don't mind some fools dying for love. There is no point in talking about this. Morning dawns in a few hours. Let's drink, dance, celebrate. Let's have some fun. It's too bright here. I will play soft music... ...to enhance the beauty of this night. Dev, I want to tell you a story. I couldn't before. A girl humiliated and humiliated... Looking for love and security in life. She barely managed to find love. When all worries are eased. Sister's condition... Those tears hurt the heart. Seeing that dark face is hard to bear. If you really love... ...begging you... ...to accept Sheila's love. She will be grateful to you. Do it for love. He believes in you, Dev. You should never reject her. Fulfill the last will. I will never ask anything again. It's a promise. I can die for love Sonia. But I can't trade love. I'm leaving tomorrow morning. I have been waiting for you all my life. No one has ever loved me so much. I would willingly die for love You worry about the little things. You think it's a silly thing. Sonia wrote that she will be back in a few days. I wonder why she left. She makes a sacrifice for Sheela. Don't you understand that? I know. But Sheila's marriage is very important. You are worried about her marriage It's not about the poor girl's life. What if Sheila commits suicide? Sheila is my daughter. She can die if she wants to. I want my late brother's daughter not to die. I will call the police and look for Sonia. It would be a disgrace to us. Our family will be disgraced. Try to understand. It's about a girl's life. You worry about respect. all right. Trust me, we will find her. Let's find her. Because Dev came here. It is a disaster for us. Grandma, do you know about this? I received Sonia's letter. She's going to die for me. I didn't tell anyone this. Now I have no choice but to tell you. I am happy. But I am a woman in a sad situation. I saw how Sonia's mother's life was ruined. I saw her die of grief. I saw the death of my son. I wish I was dead, but Sonia wouldn't let me then. Today she wants to commit suicide. God forbid if she was going to hurt herself. Before leaving this house, I might die too. Grandma, I promise I will save Sonia. If I don't... ...I'm dying too. I came to apologize Sheila. For what? what have you done? I want to marry you. what? You're kidding right? I really want to marry you. Think with your heart. Say this is what you really like. If all wishes come true... believe me. Life will be meaningless. Some wishes are important to be fulfilled. While some don't… We must live to chase. To achieve the impossible. It's like cheating yourself. Deception makes one live. We all die. I was happy to call you here. I came with high hopes. How have you changed? There is no point in talking about it. You must answer me. Will your ego allow you to listen? What arrogance are you talking about? What are you talking about? Everything ended because of your treachery. Sheela, one good karma deserves another. You can repay the kindness with another kind act. Money, or sweet words. But when it comes to love... ...You can't repay it with anything but love. I never got that love from you. I found love elsewhere. But fate had other plans. Why come to me now? Go to your lost loved one. I'm not here to scold, Sheila. Why did you come here? To save a life. Read this. Sonia will die if you don't marry me in 4 days. Then you too will die. My life is not important. But if Sonia dies, you have no right to live. This life is worse than death. What is wrong with me? Don't talk like you don't know. You are crazy. I'm telling the truth. keep quiet Don't be stubborn. You don't do that. Someone dies because of you, but you don't care. An innocent person dies, you don't care. She won the bet, but she gives her life for you. You wait for her to die. Sheela, only you can save her. Do it for humanity. For that reason. Marry me Sheela. I promise to do as you say. Your word will be my command. I hold you close to my heart. I'll be sure. May you be happy every moment. Dev. Daughter of Mr. Rajpal Singh of Shimla.
