Once upon a time... A monster with immortal powers, the Black Phoenix, had once invaded our world, far from the universe When the world was full of despair, a hero stepped forward and sealed the power of Black Phoenix with a Shura mask. He belongs to the first generation of the Fire Cloud Demons. Generations of the Luocha Family has suppressed the Black Phoenix in the mask and at the same time, they also guard the city where the mask is located at. The Black Feather has been dormant in the dark for thousands of years. Now, it's finally time for a complete revival. Go ahead, Doctor. Activate the Shura mask. After waiting for a thousand years, I'm finally free. Once I break free from this damn Shura mask, I will lead you to dominate this world again. Let's see who is the one who can handle my power Let me take a body and reborn Fire cloud palm! Fire Cloud Demon? It's my duty to guard the city. You have no regard for human life and do all kinds of evil. Today, I'm going to eliminate evil for the people. Don't you dare stand in the way of the Black Feather. It's exactly you fiends that I'm going to destroy. No one can stop the Black Phoenix from rising again from the dead, Neither can god Fire cloud palm! Why do you abet evil? Speak. He was forced into it. We can't protect our baby if we don't follow. Go. Master. Ah, my dear brother. Our father is getting old. It's time for us brothers to help him take care of the city. You must become the Fire Cloud Demon. I definitely can't, since all that's in my head is fighting and killing. But you are different, you have a sharp mind. You are the perfect heir to the Fire Cloud Demon. I'm here to pick up... Pack up and go, brother. Master Lei calls the shots on this street. If you want it, pay for it. Don't make me use violence. I've been waiting for that for an hour! Bring it on! Who would be afraid of you and the Luocha family when you are all such cowards? You are still chatting? Shoot him, go! Even the bullet is avoiding you. Since you didn't move away, you deserve it. Master, here's the deed to the land. This is such a familiar taste. I think my biological mom used to make this too. Why else would the taste be so familiar to me? How can I be your mother when I'm still so young? You people are still here with your stalls set up? - Who said you could do this? - Hurry and go! Pack these all up! All of it, hurry up! Hurry, hurry! Black Dogs are here to collect protection fee. Pay up! Black dog? White dog? Speak in a way that we can understand. This is robbery! Sure. How much money do you have right now? Give it up. Brother. Just you? I only rob people of their money, not of their virtue. I can't believe there is someone as evil as I am. You've got nice moves. Just a little weak in strength. You have good strength, but just a little thick-skinned. Are you aware of the consequences of burning my clothes? You are the oldest son of Luocha Family, Little Demon? Master... Brother! Who are you calling "brother"? Do you understand what's going on? Let us go, please? What do you think? Are you alright? Get lost. Members of the Luocha Family are not good people either. I don't want to see you again. This is not your territory. Who is she? She's my best friend, Xiaoxue. She is a famous blacksmith here. She doesn't look like a blacksmith. - What does she look like then? - Female demon. You're wrong about her. She hates gangsters and warlords the most. She thinks of them as evil tyrants. Them? Not you. I didn't do anything wrong. You destroy anyone who acts up in your territory. I didn't do anything wrong. You want to start a war when they come back for revenge. I'm not in the wrong! Shut it! I'm telling you, you're now a grown up. There's something you need to understand. When a hero slays the dragon, he needs to be careful not to turn into one himself. Do you know why? Repay violence with violence, and the results will be irreversible. I'm not scared! This city means everything to me. It's my duty to protect the people here! If someone dies because of you, I would... If that ever happens, then kill me! My Lord. Here's a letter for you from Overseer Lei. Looks like those rogue soldiers are just chess pieces that belong to Overseer Lei. And they dare to seek revenge? Well? You really want to fight? That would mean that you've fallen into a trap. Maybe he's just trying to lure the snake out. It's not a snake that they are luring, It's a dragon. Bring him to practice! Good news! The Fire Cloud Demon has been fallen right into our trap. The Shura Mask will be back in our hands in no time. Back then, if he hadn't sabotaged it, The Black Phoenix would have been reborn a long time ago. It's been eighteen years. The mask seal is at its weakest. The Sacrifice Officer will be striking tonight. As long as the ghost bird does it by himself, Whoever dares get in the way will be met with death in the end. I've decided to let you take on the position of Fire Cloud Demon. Is it me or you that's hanging upside down? Are you feeling lightheaded? I mean it. Through today's events, I understand completely that I'm not qualified at all. What's wrong with you? Which part of you isn't qualified? I'm not good at martial arts. Alright, I'll teach you tomorrow. I'm not ruthless enough. I'll help you with that. I'm not as handsome as you. Well, I have to agree with this one. I'm kidding. What is there to be afraid of? I'm here to help. Will you be able to help forever? I grew up without my parents. You and Father raised me. Who else do I help if not you? If you help me with everything, who would show me respect? Let me do it. There's an invasion Let me down. You thought you could invade our place just by luring my father elsewhere. You're asking for it! Is there anyone else from Luocha family besides Fire Cloud Demon? Remember me, I am Little Demon. You think you're worthy of the name Little Demon with those measly tricks? There is no successor to the Fire Cloud Demon. This city is about to change. Take this attack of Soul-gobbling! Call for your father, he will take care of your body. But, he will reunite with you soon enough. The phoenix is immortal and the black feather is boundless. You can't fight him. Who are you? Put me on and you can conquer anything. The fire cloud crosses mountains. Once the Shura is enraged, lives will be taken. Release my anger! Don't go there! Little Demon! What else do you have to say? It's that mask. Father, the mask did this! Take a good look for yourself. Look at the destruction you've caused! A hero slays the dragon. You are now nothing but an evil dragon. You don't deserve to be my son. Listen. From now on, if you step one foot into Luocha family, my palm will land its hit on you. Was I wrong? Hitting women? You're here. Who are you? You've grown up. We will be together soon. I am the immortal black phoenix of the universe. I will give you endless power. I want you to have everything in this world. Don't touch it. This is the demon that your father defeated in the past. He ordered that no one should touch it. He said he knew me. What connection do I have to with it? You must remember not to touch it. Otherwise, it'll be a disaster for both you and Luocha family. Even the whole city. It's you? Are you awake? Why did you hit me? Don't mess with me, let me go! Why are you all over me? Let me go! Let me go! My dear daughter. Be careful. Do you know what you did wrong? Why did you barge in all of a sudden? What do you mean, "be careful"? What do you take your daughter for? My dear girl. You have to be careful in a fight. Shut up! Don't be mad. My dear daughter, Even if you're desperate to get married you can't just invite anyone home. Who told you to come over? You're nowhere like a father. Go and stand over there. Yes, yes. You say that I'm in a hurry to get married. Why don't you stop getting in the way of my marriage? I messed things up? Xu Laosi across the door, Xiaohei on the street, the fatty in the corner of the street, Youtiao who sells buns, Baozi who fries fritters and my Aunt Xu! Your Aunt Xu? Her second son. My dear daughter, think about it. From the names to their appearances, Is there a decent one? If I hadn't stopped you, you would have already walked into the fire pit! It's better than sleeping in a cold bed. Stop provoking that boy. He's definitely a troublemaker. You think that I can't afford to mess with him? Look at him now. Stop there! You're thinking of running? You're going to regret if you don't let me go. You don't take responsibility for your mistakes. You're not fit to be called man. - I didn't do anything wrong! - Nothing wrong? You slept with my daughter! - I didn't! - You didn't? My daughter said it herself! I didn't! You made mistakes but you're not taking responsibility for it. - You dare to do but not to admit! - I... You lowlife, I'm going to destroy you. Why did you throw him out? I was keeping him to make him compensate the neighbourhood. You didn't tell me. Little Demon, what's wrong? Wake up, wake up! What's going on? Wasn't he at your house? Forget it. Is he still alive? You're so beautiful. Are you crazy? I'm sick. I'm lovesick! What are you doing? - He drank the potion that you made me buy. - I want to die. Who dares to come to my house to cause trouble? - Good morning, Landlady. - Shut up. How rude. Am I that old? How many times have I told you? We are sisters after all. We don't have to be so restrained. Just call me Xiao Baobao. Xiao Baobao? It's you. Follow me. Do you think he's going to be okay? Being taken away by that she-devil, he's doomed. I... Why am I dressed like this? I helped you change. Is it sexy? What else do you want? Dance with me. What do you take me for? A gigolo? You can't be serious. Gigolos are much more dedicated than you. I'm telling you this. In here, you belong to me. Finish this dance with me. Or you are not a real man. You three old men. I can't believe you didn't tell me that the kid who was in the container back then was picked up by the Fire Cloud Demon. You didn't just make me lose my mask, you almost got me killed by the power of the Dark Phoenix. Mistakes after mistakes. You deserve to die! Luckily, I have one last person that I can make use of. My dear daughter. Why don't we get a change of environment? You want to move houses again? You've uprooted with me over and over again when I was a child. You only settled down after moving here. I never knew why before. Now I finally realize that this is the only place in town where the police and the law are not concerned about warlords and hooligans. With us hiding here, The Luocha family won't be able to find us. Now that Little Demon is here, You suddenly want to move again. Why? Why are you afraid of the Luocha family? I'm not afraid, I'm guilty! In the past, I did something vicious and against my own conscience. It was the Fire Cloud Demon who prevented me from continuing the mistake. He is, so to speak, my benefactor. Since you're not afraid of them, Why are you moving out again? This is not something you should know. Go get ready and pack your things. - We're leaving right now. - I'm not going. - You... - You lied to me half my life. That is enough. I won't listen to you anymore. You! Well, are you upset to see that I'm alive? Hurry and eat. It won't taste as good if it gets cold. I understand. You are not as evil as I am. You are even more vicious than I am. Since you're not dead, then pay up. Don't worry. When I get back and explain the situation to my dad, I'll be sure to bring the money to you. You're still thinking of going back? Help! Move aside. There's nothing to see. Move along. Move aside if you don't want to cause any trouble. Today, I shall prove to you that I'm not the tyrant you think I am. Well? Coming back to take revenge? Alright, according to usual rules. One on one. Little Demon, what are you doing here? He... I thought he was banished, brother? I can't beat him, whether he's banished or not. If you won't make the first move, then I will. Dad. I can't believe you blocked my veins. You don't even want me to use kungfu? What's going on? Looks like he's got an internal injury. Come on! Hit me. Come on, come on. You are tough. You Little Demon. Come on, hit me. Come on. Hit me. Stop it! Little Demon! Why? You didn't even give me a chance to prove myself. Father, are you really giving up on me? You're still protecting this thing You're still protecting it Do you really think you're the Young Master of the Luocha family? You are now nothing but an abandoned dog. That's right! My silly master. You used to stand up for people. From now on, all you can do is be a cowardly turtle with his head low. Little Demon! Brothers, let's go. Let's go, let's go. Father. Please take the order back. Bring my brother back. He got what he deserved. But it's too much for him. Although he made mistakes, he should be given another chance to redeem himself. Father, why do you have to drive him into a corner? If not, how else can he be reborn? Forcing him to experience desperate situations is the only way to let him strengthen his mind and become a real Demon. You mean to let my brother take the position of Fire Cloud Demon? It's still too early to decide. Nevertheless, in my heart, he is the ideal successor. Even though he's not my biological son, but we are family after all. That's right. We... We are family. He has always been fearless. As long as he thinks it's right, he never backs down. That is very dangerous. I am trying to make him take one step back. Yes. Something has happened! Something has happened! Yanli. I think I heard a loud noise coming from nearby just now. Something bad has happened. I was just walking along the road when I saw that the building where Uncle Seven works has collapsed. All of the people are trapped under the rubble. There's a kid over there! Hurry, lend me a hand! Please help! Hold on, little boy. Your hand. Saving lives matter more. Let's all help to move this together! Here too! - Why isn't anyone coming to help? - Be careful! How many people do you think you can rescue at this rate? Where's the fire brigade? I've already called them, but they will only come if we pay them $50. We can't afford that amount of money. They're going too far. We don't need them. Hurry! Hurry, come on and help. It's all thanks to you. Thank you, thank you so much. It's all thanks to him. It's been hard on you. You've been living under the radar for so many years. Thank you for coming out of the shadows. Even though I don't like fighting, my heart is always with the Luocha Family. What do you think of him as Fire Cloud Demon? He's better than you. No way. Indeed, I'm too old now. I'm kidding. When it comes to your family and yourself, you're always so serious. How can I not be? The weight of the entire city lies on my shoulders. It's my duty to protect it. When are you going to bring him back? Very soon. Hey, what are you doing over there? Spying on me? I don't give a damn about you. It is you who worried about being chopped into pieces anyway not me. Since we're here, let's have a drink. Well, scared I'll eat you up? No, just checking to see if you brought along your hammer. Do you men lose courage, when you lose your power? Who are you referring to? My dad. What's wrong with your dad? I don't have to drink alone here I wouldn't be here alone, drowning my worries. Come on, cheers. Cheers. My dad claims that I fancy you. Do you really like me? How could I possibly like you? Perhaps, it is me who likes you. What did you say? Nothing. Look at this place. You can't imagine how hard it is to protect this city. Look at those lights. - Are they beautiful? - They're beautiful. Well, then do you know that the lights of each neon sign were made by the locals here with their own hands, one by one. They seem to me to be the ones having the hardest time. They are the real owners of this city. What about me? You're just someone who's idling away. Hey, wake up. I don't have any energy right now. How am I supposed to carry you down? You're alone? Are you here to seek death? You think too little of me. I come here specially to give you a gift. Who knew you would do whatever it takes to become the Fire Cloud Demon. The Shura Mask is a threat to me. But I can turn this threat into something of the greatest value. I can't believe the Black Feather is still alive and active. You have no idea how terrible the Black Feather can be. You can't continue your evil ways with me around. Strictly speaking, all I want to do is shoot at you, Your Excellency. Or to get shot by you. Seven-talon kill! I'm indeed old but I can still protect this city! Fire cloud iron drum! Ghost bird split! Ground fire burn! In face of thunder, your flame is way too weak. I'll use all the electricity in the city. Fire Cloud Demon, you are bound to die. Ghost bird leading thunder! Time is nothing to the Black Feather. To get the Shura mask, we prepared for a thousand years. Who would have thought that the Great Demon would end up like this? The eldest son wants to see his lordship one last time. There is no such person here! From now on, there will be only one young master and that's me, Xicheng Xiu. Brother, you should go. Let me in. I need to see him one last time. I'm sorry. I can't do that. Why? Why won't you let me in? Do you know? Right up till the moment he collapsed, he hadn't said a single word of forgiveness towards you. If you ever set foot on the territory of the Luocha family again, then I must obey my father's wishes and kill you. I made this specially for you. I heard that you Luocha Family are fond of this soup. Even though you are not related to me by blood, you will always be my son. It's your birthday today, too. Come. Let's take a picture together as a family. I forgot the pepper. I'll get it. Are you all right? My father made me this soup every day. He made me drink this every day. I'm not going to be able to drink it anymore. Father. I was wrong. I miss you so much. How could I fall in love with him? Daughter, I'm sorry. Dad made a mistake and got you into trouble. But I'm sending you away even if you hate me. Haven't you been on the run for years? Isn't it enough? You can't get away with this, Doctor. You can hide for a while, but you can't hide forever. God has no justice. That is why you were meant to uphold justice for him. If it lives, many people are going to die. It's their honor. Twenty years. Stuck in this hellhole. Don't you think it's lame? Being able to live these twenty years, I am content. You've wasted a better life. Fine. Finally getting out of this cursed mask. Ghost bird, he's trying to destroy the mask! Spanish jade sword! Landlady? Shut up, I'm Jin Qianbao. You are one of the three dharmas of the Luocha family. I never knew the Fire Cloud Demon had a plan like this. I hate violence and fights the most. But, I will take revenge for his lordship. The Fire Cloud Demon was defeated by me. It will be the same for you. Practice of Jade Sword. It's Spanish practice of jade sword. Spanish? I'll beat you up anyway. I'm so scared! Are you all right? My lord! Is that all you can do? And you are trying to prevent me from coming back into this world? I'm not fully formed yet. Ghost bird, he wants to break the container prematurely to take away my strength. - Old man! - Xiaoxue! Hey! Father Tie. Two decades ago, Black Feather forced me to activate the Shura mask and release the evil Lord from within, the Black Phoenix. For twenty years, I've been living with regret. Father Tie. At first, I wanted to get Xiaoxue settled. I didn't expect these demons to come so soon. I was so close to ruining it for good, but I've reached my limit. I'll leave my daughter to you. You. Follow me. You guys. Weren't you dead? The phoenix is immortal and the black feather is boundless. You're the one who doesn't seem to understand that. You're trying to kill me after taking advantage of me. Do you even know where the Shura mask is? It was taken away by Little Demon, wasn't it? Helping me to find the doctor was your way of setting me up! I betray even my own father. Let alone you. Xicheng Xiu. I'm the one who helped you become the Fire Cloud Demon. Nobody is immortal. Now is not the time to dance. Little Bao. Your veins are finally unsealed. You made me dance to help me get my skills back. I'm not the one who helped you. It's your father. The reason why he banished you is to sharpen your mind. Sure enough. You didn't let him down. Little Bao. Little Bao. I'm so sleepy. Oh, and one more thing. Your father has left a secret weapon for you. It's right there. You call this a secret weapon? This is the Fire Cloud suit. He wants you to take over his mantle and become a true Fire Cloud Demon. Dad. Dharma Jin, long time no see. Aren't you loyal to the second young master? My allegiance is to his lordship. He has been rescued. The second young master wants you to bring the mask back in exchange for meeting him. I'll go. I'm here to tell you not to go. The second young master has hooked up with the Black Feather to kill you. My father is not the only one at their mercy. Xiaoxue is also waiting for me to rescue her. Hey! I know you stayed here because of Xiaoxue. You're leaving because of her as well. You must save her. I will. You. Why on earth would you do that? Have you never imagined that I've envied you ever since I was a kid? You are unrelated to my father by blood but you received more love from him than I did. Has it crossed your mind that I've hated you since I was a kid? You claim to want to help me all the time. And look now. You took everything from me. If it weren't for you, I wouldn't be who I am today. Where's the mask? Let her go. Put it on. You want to use me to revive the Black Phoenix. You need to die in order for her to live. Make a choice! Welcome to the Shura kingdom. Who are you? I am you. Why are you surprised? You and I were one right from the start. It's just a matter of becoming whole again. A demon from nowhere doesn't deserve to join me. The Phoenix is immortal. Greeting the Black Phoenix! Fighting back will only make you more miserable. You can't change your destiny. You're just a container for me. It will never be reborn. Greatness cannot be accomplished without the human world being in disorder. Just be a container and welcome a brand new world. You're right. I'm just your container. However, if the container breaks, what happens to the water inside? You're insane. Are you tired of living? Xiaoxue. What on earth did you do to her? She's just like you. You are both the containers that I selected. Don't you dare hurt her! Get lost and go back into that mask! I... am the Fire Cloud Demon! Fire cloud palm attack! Come back! Have you forgotten? After slaying the dragon, the hero should cease to exist. Or he would become the next dragon. Little Demon! Little Demon. You haven't won yet. What you don't know is that in this world there's not just one Shura mask. Just by looking at this place, you can't imagine how hard it could be to protect this city. I know now. Little Demon. His lordship's life was saved, but he can no longer recover.
