Free him from his pain. Take a lock of his hair back to Korea. Fear not, I will take this to your family. AD 1 3 75-The first year of the King WOO, Korean Dynasty. Meanwhile in China CHU Yuan-chang established Ming Dynasty and drove the Yuan Dynasty north of the Great Wall. Diplomatic relations between Korea and the Ming rapidly deteriorate after the murder of a Ming diplomatic envoy. "Korea sent out numerous diplomatic envoys, including CHOI, SOHN and KIM, only two remain out of contact. When diplomatic relations improve, most of them returned home but there were others who were unable to return... MUSA Joo Jin Mo Ziyi Zhang Rong Guang Yu Lee Doo Il / Park Yong Woo Park Jung Hark / Yu Hae Jin Jung Suk Yong / Han Young Mok Special Performance Song Jae Ho Halt! Since the castle is still under construction, they'll lead us to a temporary guest house. This hall is larger than I expected. This place doesn't look like a lodge. I will ask. General, behave honorably I'm General CHOI Jung of Korea's Yongho troops. Where are the Ming's officials to greet us? You criminals, put down your weapons! After murdering our diplomatic envoy, Korea has continued to dispatch spies in secret. Now they send their military in the name of so-called diplomatic relations! Unforgivable! Arrest them! Don't panic. Stay where you are. Stay back Throw down your weapons. Anyone who disobeys will feel my sword! General CHOI! General, Don't My duty is to protect the delegation. General CHOI Jung! Everyone... Listen to them. General! We don't have much further to go. I acted rashly...I'm sorry. It's my fault... We were already destined for imprisonment. Exile is better than suffocating in an underground prison. But it's too hot here. Ugh! Greetings. We...are from Korea. We're in exile, having been sentenced by Ming Emperor CHU Yuan-chang. Aren't you a general from the Great Yuan Empire? the great Cokotemure's cavalry! General, don't step forward this time. Do not say anything to offend them. We have nothing against the Korean. But, we can't permit a single Ming dog to live! Leave the Korean's fate in their own hands. Let's go! General, including the ambassador and a general Seh, we have 12 casualties and 23 survivors among the survivors, five are severely injured Have everyone gather here! How about preparing to camp out here? Since the ambassador died we cannot exercise our duty as diplomatic envoys. Such responsibility now lies in my hands. If we stay here, the Ming army from Lanzhou will come. We can then explain the whole story to them... You wish to continue towards exile? We should stay here. Before being prisoners, we're delegates of a country. We've been stripped of our official letter and flag. How can we prove who we are? Besides, any Ming army we meet will suspect us of murdering their people. General, we have caught horses! Two of them. The duty of the Yongho squad ends now Get ready to leave, immediately! Get ready to leave, immediately! Yes sir! This is an endless desert. Where are we going? Back to Korea. General, three are missing the others are all injured We need to find water and food fast Hey, Interpreter! We must hurry and leave We all die if we stay here! Wake up! Come to your senses! Let me go, let me go!! We're leaving. General, we should look for the missing first This trip is too overwhelming for an old man like myself. I always wanted to be buried at my home Are you in much pain? Can we rest here for a while? No. Sir. Even if we make it to Shandong we still need a boat Too soon to worry about that. Please get up! What is it? Yeosol! General, please forgive my man He is a foolish one... He just wants to care for me He is a slave of the vice-ambassador This is the Great Wall leading to the east where the Ming and the Yuan forces are in battle. Below are villages where the Ming troops are based Avoid the village and the Ming troops We cannot risk meeting anyone. General, if we head north we must confront Yuan's troops What about here in the middle? Impossible! It's a desert of death It's burning hot during the day, Also, it takes at least twenty days to cross We only have food and water for 6 days. To there We'll make it in 10 days. If necessary we will eat once a day and walk during the night in that case, the southern desert is better we can gain three or four days Whose territory is that? that is an abandon land No one could conquer the area However, my concern is the vice-ambassador He is already exhausted No one here is free from suffering! From now on, you guide us Don't stop marching Whoever stops marching will be executed! Son of a bitch! He makes us fry. He will kill us Did you call me? As a vice-ambassador, I'm ashamed I am in such a wretched state Take care of the group I bid you a safe trip home... Understood. One last thing... This man here He is not a slave anymore As I set him free, he is a freeman Treat him accordingly Please get some sleep Hey you, stop there! He stole the food while standing guard Sorry, sir Please forgive me No mercy to a thief in the battle The same goes for one who has taken Beat them twenty floggings each Our Joojin troops only eat one piece a day We are equal to your Yongho troops I will receive the floggings instead of him! Do what he wants All right. You, receive all floggings for both Watch carefully! You've served in many battles with my father Am I quite different to him? The times were not as difficult as now But I am sure you will do well, sir Will we make it safely to Shandong? Even if we return to Korea, they'll be laughing at us. I failed to protect the envoys I even failed to enter the castle of Nanjing Here you go Use it when you need it Take it In this situation, dying is better The vice-ambassador disappeared! Stop him and see to the second envoy. He has died, sir! Bury the body The Yongho squad will take the horses. You may bury him yourself but we will take the horses General Keep following the path Good afternoon? Please give us food and water I can't tell where you are from by your accent. What should we do? Should we tell them we are diplomatic envoys from Korea? Don't do that They won't believe us anyway. If you want to eat you should pay for it! What are they saying, bastard? Do something. We're starving Say something... I can't stand anymore.. I cant bear it! if you move one more step then I'll kill you right now Are you from Korea? Monk, are you also from Korea? Sir, serve food to these people I will pay for it Many thanks. I'm General CHOI Jung My Buddhist name is Jisan I am glad to have company on the way home You, thief. How dare you touch my property! Uh? You're a Mongolian soldier! Sir How come you have a Mongolian sword? General! A few days ago, we passed the battlefields. There were only dead soldiers. ...Are you a Buddhist monk? Yes Do you know how to hold a ceremony for the dead? Yes, I learned the Buddhist incantations as well Would you write down the name of the dead? All my men were brave warriors Just write "The Sons of the Blue Wolf" Treat the injured first The General is coming Have some, Princess Will you keep refusing food? Did you hear that he called her princess? "Free me" what do you want? Shit! Who put this filthy corpse here? You put this here, didn't you? Get rid of it, now! Don't kill him It's been ages since I've seen such skill with a spear. Where are you from? Don't move. We might lose everything the Yuan troops and the Central Asians are the confederates. They might kill us all He has the eyes of a lion I wish to make him one of my men. General he already killed five of our men I will give you ten horses in return You're buried in this strange place You met at the wrong place and time. God bless you! If you insist on this difficult path I will join you No need for that I am familiar with these roads and might be able to help you We are done with the burial. Shall we leave? We should wait here The Yuan army will pass through here. we will save the princess! Didn't you say we were heading towards Korea, sir? That was my intention until yesterday However, we are the diplomatic envoys If we help the Ming dynasty, we'll receive a grand welcome from Nanjing. We'll be able to return home afterwards. a reckless plan! Yuan troops are the strongest in the world Please reconsider General I made this decision after deliberating all night. Let's try Daejung! We have to save Yeosol, too. We will attack them on both sides The Yongho squad and I will attack from the front Lieutenant will lead the others and ambush them from the rear Now go! Damn it! They're coming! We will attack them all together! General, we don't have any chance to win We can do it General Everyone, hide yourselves Daejung! Now's our chance! Attack the horses first Save the Princess Interpreter! Interpreter Park! Go away, go away! what an idiot I'm General CHOI Jung sent with the Korean envoys to Nanjing. Get up The emperor calls me princess Buyong You don't look like envoys, though. I also thought a princess lived in the palace your highness Take me to the castle of Nanjing as soon as possible If you escort me there safely, the emperor will reward you. We did save you, now we are responsible for your protection as well Your highness board the carriage without any worries It is our total victory, sir Are you ok? hey you!

You can talk... I am ordering you again. Guard the carriage! I am a free man now! I will do as I please! Please, calm down, general I don't need a slave who has forgotten his place! But the vice-ambassador has set him free, sir He was out of mind on the brink of death He who is born a slave shall die a slave. That's the law of Korea! Stop it Leave this bastard here. Everyone, mount your horses! General! One girl has survived. She is a Chinese slut. Leave her behind General, mercy is the virtue of a great man This is not any of your concern All decisions will be mine Take everyone with you! General! General!

Thank you Please get some rest, your highness I'm Yooran Yooran? meaning of a dancing orchid? That is the most beautiful name I've ever heard I am PARK Jumyung You have cute eyes You wicked one! As a member of the envoys you don't have any regrets in this predicament lay with a woman instead What responsibilities do I have? I am just an interpreter How come you regret at all These miscellaneous readings are in vain what? you are the one who ruined the country and accumulated wealth in a Buddhist temple... How dare you mention the Confucius as miscellaneous readings? What an egotistic views the Confucius as best Hope for a wonderful world is in every teaching The Confucius's words were spread all over the world Open your eyes you should know the principles of the world? The first time I made love It was the full moon festival in January. Solmae was sixteen, I was eighteen. Every evening we met in the hills Then one day, she became pregnant We got married, and... Five days later, I was enlisted on this mission. Was it a son or a daughter? When I left, She was 8 months pregnant I guess she's given birth by now. I miss my wife so much Is he ok? You should get some sleep. I'll take care of him... Tomorrow, he can recover, your highness Where are you heading? To Korea, your highness. You don't seem to get along well with each other. People, when traveling together a long way, may come across as so. Take good care of him Thank you, your highness Do not worry about the vice ambassador He was buried in a place with plenty of sunshine Do you have any family back home? I'm all alone. From now on, you're not alone We'll go together. To Korea. CHU Yuan-chang will be anxious to find the princess. we must head north Get out, everyone I have something to say with Rambulhwa Do me a favor Please name it CHU Yuan-chang has kidnapped my sister. Bring her back to me. Why did you help me? You must resent the Ming for sending you into exile. I don't take it personally. If you help us see the emperor, We'll be able to resolve this misunderstanding. What is the name of that man? He is just a slave, your highness I asked his name They're coming! They're after us! How far have they come? They're moving really fast, sir How many are there? Over a hundred, sir We don't have much time We have to leave at once We cannot avoid them What can we do, General? We'll lure them to the carriage. That's a good idea, sir! Who's going to drive the carriage? I'll do it, sir. Give me two soldiers of Yongho troop Whoever hasn't fought will drive the carriage. no, no I'm just an interpreter And I never drove a carriage before He is too young, sir It has been decided. How come it's always us, the Joojin soldiers? Why don't you say something? He hasn't even seen his child yet. Someone has to drive the carriage! Take him to the carriage! Sgt. Jinlip We'll make them think the princess is in the carriage. put this on Please help me You can help me, can't you? I'm sorry. Let me go with you Take a detour around the mountain, after that you can see the Hwangho River We'll wait for you there. Please take these, return to the master's family We will meet Take care of Dansaeng You're doing this for me. Never forget your duty is to protect the princess. It's me Be sure, you return to me Halt! We'll walk from here. Tie the horses together and hide them What if Dansaeng doesn't come back? The Mongolians are not stupid. They'll come after us sooner or later I'll be right behind you The princess must not be in the carriage. There can't be only one soldier guarding her They must have crossed the mountains by now, heading for the Hwangho river Then, it'll be impossible to catch them. They'll have to cross the River eventually anyway. We'll burn the village and the ferry! So nobody can cross the river! yes! What about him? Go and kill him. Hurry, lets go Hurry, let's go! Move! It's the Mongolian soldiers Dansaeng! Dansaeng!! Throw that robe away and run. Now Go, now! Hurry, run Go! And run Yeosol Yeosol Yeosol! Yeosol!! I am so sorry Get up I served two years against the north and two years to fighting the Japanese Altogether it was four years in the military When I got back only rat shit was in the kitchen Shit! So I went to the head officer and hit him with my head, bang So did they force you to choose between imprisonment or military service? How did you know that? It is so obvious Don't go back at all I heard that there is a Korea village in Beijing I will go back no matter what My wife is waiting for me Guess your wife is awfully pretty? She is like a fat bear Yet, for me, she is the prettiest thing in the world What about you? Don't you miss your wife? How many times do I have to tell you? I'm not married, yet I see What happened? As we expected Sir, come Be patient, even if its freezing That is if you don't want to call the Mongolian troops I didn't mean to wake you... I apologize, your highness. I had a dream I was already in the Royal Palace Once we cross the Hwangho river, we will escort you to the castle of Nanjing Daejung tells me that this group is heading towards Shandong Believe me. I will keep my word, your highness Will the carriage return? I am sure it will, your highness They aren't here, sir Divide the soldiers and search each area. What about the people here? They've seen us. We can't spare them! Not a soul is at the ferry We need to check for sure. Why aren't we going down? We'll first go down the valley over there. HAIl Go round to check and return What's going on down there? the enemy are hiding near the ferry Killing everyone who tries to cross the river! We'll have to give up Shandong as well as Nanjing. Who are they, huh? I didn't have any intention of bringing them here They just followed me from the ferry Now, the Yuan troops will find us for sure! Then I should scare them off! Everyone, stop! Stop, everyone! Didn't you hear me? I never dreamed I would see you here, your highness I have something to discuss with both of you Let's cross the river when night falls Yes... it is too far to Dungju It would be better to go to Balhae Bay and find a ferry there You mean that we cross the sea by ferry? If you plan to pass through the Yuan cavalry, go by yourself. after crossing the Hwangho river What if the general still insists on escorting the princess to Nanjing? Are you crazy? We have to return to Korea In fact, the princess brings us only problems Besides, it seems that we have to take those people, too. We have good news 5 days traveling from here, we can be in the fortress by the coast where the Ming troops are based The princess says if we escort her and her entourage there, she will arrange a boat for us, which will take us back to Korea Let's accept her offer. We'll still wait for the carriage, won't we? Do you think they will come back alive? Nobody goes back to Korea without a boat Also we can be safe with Ming soldiers Because the King will know that we've saved his daughter. The Yuan warriors won't give up the princess. But it's true that we need a boat. I'll follow your advice, general Good Get up But we still have to wait for the carriage. We all agreed, your highness If your decision is out of pity, then return everything back to where it was It is not the time for pity Prepare to leave Stay Joojin troops here You will leave when Yeosol and Dansaeng return You've been in the military long enough to know the result of disobeying a general's orders... General what are your orders... we should wait until this evening passes Danseng is here ! You came back alive... You're alright? are you ok? I'm glad you made it back. Welcome back Its stained with Yuan troops I am glad you returned alive I did not wish to give a slave such an honorable death The nobles tend to have useless thoughts Shouldn't we arrange a horse for the princess? She is not the princess of Korea The princess wants to ride in a palanquin It is out of the question Get thick wood, now It is foolish Daejung Carry it! Hey, captain Why the hell do we have to carry this? Someone has to carry it Hurry! The soles of my feet are parched like a turtle's shell. We don't have much time shit I'll carry it ~ In the mountains ablaze with maples, white birds are singing ~ ~ I want to hear the birdsong, i wish to go back home ~ idiot! Remember the Yuan troops are right behind us I'm sorry. You're even louder than she is! She's just trying to comfort the children Aren't you worried about the children? If you are that thoughtful, you wouldn't be playing around with a prostitute if the Yuan troops catch us those children are the first to die and you are also the first one who runs off What? What do you know about me? your a strange one Look at yourself We've walked all day, but only traveled 12 kilometers at this rate it'll take us over 20 days. Brother, I don't understand at all How can you still be alone at your age? no one waiting for you at home? I really don't have anyone. Really Dont you have any girl or sweatheart? HAIl, you also miss your wife, don't you? He's still a bachelor How many times have I told you? You haven't had sex with a girl, have you? why havn't you got married until now? he took the wrong pills when he was young Yeah, he has still a child's penis Would you like to try this? No Hey, hey... Old lady, old lady...come back! She's a demented old woman. Since her son was killed on the ferry No one takes care of her. How can we care for an old woman like her at such a time? Bring her here. She too, is one of my people. Who are you? Let me go... I'll carry her on my back soldiers are coming this way, sir Do you think they've found us? I'm sure of it. Then let's just take the princess and leave. If we take the others along, we'll all die He's right We'll just take the princess and Yooran We must keep our word to the princess. We'll take them with us. The Yuan cavalry are faster than the wind Even a hunter takes care of wild animals seeking shelter from the rain. That's a basic moral... I will stay with them if you want to leave without them bastard Don't you miss your mother? my ma would be proud of me Let's go together, as far as we can What are you doing? The Yuan soldiers are coming, let's go! The princess goes first with the Joojin troops Joojin soldiers! Order them to carry the palanquin. Now! quickly This palanquin is holding us back General Are you waiting for the Yuan troops to catch us? We'll leave if you get out of the carriage, your highness. Who dares to speak so? Get out Order them to carry my palanquin at once! Stop! The princess will be targeted by the enemy because of this palanquin The Yongho troops and I will charge at them Wait here! No need to go meet the men who are chasing you. I make the decisions here. You just follow my orders! Let's go! Cavalrymen are at a disadvantage in the forest. When you go down, keep 20 steps between you and the next man If you're too far apart, you risk being overpowered by the enemy. Are you afraid? Then, stay here until you hear something. You can rush out then I'll go in your place, general! Watch the hill If they pass through here, the princess will be in great danger On my signal, everyone charge at them Do as I say! Understand? Dansaeng yes is that you? We'll take care of things here. Go protect the princess. Look, the Lieutenant is coming It is very important. Make sure you deliver it Please trust my husband, your highness. Now, go They're coming! Go, hurry Be careful Move, princess There is the princess Stand back! Stop it! Don't move Get your filthy hands off me, you slave! You could've killed me! I'm a princess! Stop yelling at me! Don't think you can do anything just because you're a princess. Leave me alone Take this Lieutenant! Ganam! Are you okay? What about the Yongho troops? Help me up What happened to the enemy? Sgt.Jinlip led the Joojin squad to annihilate them, sir. What about the princess? She is coming this way, sir That's enough resting. We should leave now. It's quite late and you must rest a bit more, sir. It would be better leaving early in the morning, sir. I said get up! If you wish to leave, feel free, sir We'll get some sleep and then leave. I know that you are the troublemaker they look up to I let you get away with it before, but I won't tolerate it any longer. Leave him alone! Dochoong, Sit down... General! Now sheath your sword! How dare you! Lieutenant, arrest these men at once! Now!! Look... How about having captain Daejung as our leader from now on? So that we can reach the fortress without trouble Dochoong! General... You should let Daejung lead us to the fortress Do you think you made it here by yourself? in this difficult situation Someone had to make tough decisions Do you know that? I made these decisions on behalf of the group From now on, whoever gets in my way I'll cut their throat in the name of the king General, you are still in recovering... Don't... You know the one I want to kill most? It's you! Why don't you stop the general? General, come back! You may lead these poor people, but that doesn't change our situation Do you think all thats happened was caused by him? I am not bright enough to know the future You should have held onto the general The thing I desire most is for us to get home We must leave this place Your highness, did you have a nightmare? The clay fortress is not too far away now We should prepare to leave But your highness, everyone is asleep. Don't worry too much He couldn't have gone too far Even if he desired to come back hes too stubborn to do so "I'm princess of the Ming Empire. Pursued by Yuan troops, we are headed towards the fortress of Weihai. Send the soldiers there immediately" Weihai! We will go around the forest We cannot sir If we don't chase them now we will lose them in the woods Their destination is where the forest ends I vowed never to return without capturing the princess we've all been prepared to die since we started the battle Mongol warriors have never been afraid of death We're not afraid! Fight to the end! Be careful, you are pregnant. Thank you Your welcome Daejung How are the wounds? the poison in his body is almost neutralized Why aren't you helping the general up? It is not necessary! I can get up by myself General, get up Do not call me General anymore Whatever you say, you are still a general You led the group very well. Please come with us Come with me A well! Where are all the boats? What about the Ming army? Where's the princess? We came all the way here trusting that bitch's words. Now what? It's not the princess' fault Then whose fault is it? You were the first one to suggest coming here, weren't you? Stop it! How could anyone have known about this? The Yuan soldiers will come soon. We have to decide what to do first. Let's leave this place Close the gates! Go find something to bar the gate. Hurry! Find a soldier who speaks Korean. Listen! For years, Korea has been a subject of the Great Yuan Empire. If you hand over the princess, we will spare your lives Daejung, we are out matched The princess is none of our business any more What they want is me You have escorted me here, so you kept your promise You don't need to sacrifice yourselves for me If you refuse to hand her over, we will massacre all of you! Daejung, you must decide Please, help us. Uh? The gates are opening the great fighter is still alive He ruins everything Those who wish to leave may do so Those who wish to stay, may stay Honey, honey Pitch the tents.

I will fight by myself I was the one who made us head to Korea and save the princess I started everything Whether we go home or fight for a name this is the time for all of us to unite It is none of your business This is my war Distribute liquor to the soldiers and let them sleep until the sun is fully up We have to capture the princess and return to the base as soon as possible For the past three months, we haven't rested for a single day We need to attack them as quickly as we can! What if the Ming troops come... There is only two options Them and us How many can be alive among us? stay with me Wow! Thank you brother its relatively safe at the coast and sides of the castle. Let's protect the front Monk, take care of the princess and the elderly people The Interpreter and I will take care of the central gate you and Dochoong in the east Yeosol and HA-Il will protect in the west.... Dochoong and I will cover the east what about me, sir? Dansaeng, you also have something to do Sit still, okay, Don't move... Never come out, never! You hear?

We almost won What the hell... Kill them all Saori... Saori Look over there A white flag at the Yuan's side It is to mourn the death of someone in high position If they attack once again It will be difficult for us to beat them General! why did you order us to withdraw? Dig a deep well in the middle of the hill. We were on the verge of defeating them. Cookoo has passed away Right after we left headquarters... We'll hold a memorial ceremony and resume our attack afterwards. Why did you leave your post! Because of you, So many people died Stop chanting that It is making people angrier Stop crying we've beaten the enemy Your family has proved its loyalty to the Ming Empire The Emperor will reward you greatly Reward? Hey, who made us come all the way over here? Both my husband and daughter have died because of you ! How dare you talk to the princess like that You go! Then, we can be all safe. Because of you, we will die like dogs Lieutenant! What the hell are they doing? The water channel is blocked Everything will be over by tomorrow Cookoo started a hopeless war The dreams of the great Ghengis Khan may fade away forever Don't say that. Your words have great influence on the mens fighting sprit Let's return to the prairies You mean we should leave just like that? We're taking the princess with us. The children are waiting for you Why did they find me? I have no business with them, right? It is not your intension to avoid a battle You told me that I was irresponsible, didn't you? You were right I am... mean and a coward In this situation, its harder for one not to fight than to fight If you refuse a needless cruelty, keep the conviction I think that is courage too? At one time I was a student of Confucianism, dreaming of the righteous world But for a countryman like me I was not even given the chance to apply for the position of government official That is why I joined this journey on which no one else wanted to go I wanted to create an opportunity... I always end up with bad luck...why? Pray for a hundred days to Buddha He will help you Does it really work? Aren't you going to the children? She is giving birth! We need hot water... What shall we do? We don't even have drinking water What the hell are all these men doing here! Get out! Get out! Isn't that Dansaeng? Where is he going?

Dansaeng, come back Come on. Hurry up Get this one first Hurry up Smarter than I thought. Do you want to try? Dansaeng. That's alright Give me your hand No! Dansaeng Shit Stop crying Let him cry Who the hell told you to come here? So you could wail for us all when we croak? Dochoong! Before we do, get my eye back. My eyeball! Dochoong You said you would give us a boat, didn't you? Can't the great princess of the Ming Empire give us a measly boat? We slaved like pigs to get all the way over here... now where's the boat? The boat! What did you do that for? why? How come you hit me? Then, hit me. Hit me more! Don't blame the princess Everything was my decision The general will take responsibility? How do you take responsibility for a situation like this? We can just send the princess out alone. Why can't we do that? Why? Why, what's holding us back? What! That's enough... Let me go, you son of a bitch! Someone has to tell the princess about this Just shut up Daejung! Don't stop them It's better to let them say what's on their minds General, what are they talking about? You're all cowards! Then, let's just cut off her head! You keep out of this If we hang her head outside the fortress wall, they might turn back If you wish, I will do it! interpreter, what's Yeesol saying? Tell me! I order you! That you should be sent to the enemy Shuts your mouth! Then, do you want me to tell her that he offered to cut her head off? Do you have any idea how much that would frighten her? I came all the way here just for her Never wish for something you can never get Don't forget you're a slave Have you ever heard of the slave, Manjuk? He said, "People are all equal Is there a seed that has its class written on it?" After saying those words, he was hanged Whoever aims at my neck will have his arm cut off first. My sword has no mercy Do you want to try? Too many have died so far, too many... Now you want us to kill each other? From now on, whatever happens... Don't help me It's a boy! Bless the child for his life, your highness. for luck and health What are you doing? Are you trying to freeze the child to death? She doesn't deserve to bless anyone. Hurry and take the child inside Before he catches cold Your highness Your highness forgive me Bring me a horse I am leaving this fortress Wait, your highness. What have we been fighting for, if not for you? Everyone wishes me to leave this place as soon as possible As a princess of the Great Ming Empire I will end this war with my own hands! Your highness, please don't go. Please don't go. Do you want me to take my own life right here? Nobody move. I will go by myself General... Get out of my way The Koreans won't give up on you, your highness Please trust me! How dare you block my path? Do not act rashly. they are coming towards us Don't go! Will you stand watch outside the fortress? Kill him! Wait Let him pick up the sword What happened to the others? What about Yeesol? Just stay where you are Daejung, Daejung You can't move sir, not now don't move The royal castle was too suffocating for me I thought that if I left there I would be free This is all my fault I'm so scared I don't think I can bear it any longer I am also a coward I was always afraid that people would notice that I do not deserve being called general Everyone come here He looks to be dead. Look! He's moving! He has one hell of a grip on life. General, what is the meaning of this? If they come out to rescue him, we'll enter the fortress with ease. If they decide not to come out for him that warrior is mine Is there anyone who will save him? I'll go General, if we open the gate doors now, we'll all die. Right into the enemy's trap. Then you're saying we should just stand back and watch? That's a good idea! Let's just kill him with our own hands Should I throw the torch? The moonlight is bright... Daejung... Daejung Don't shoot! You like him too, don't you? Daejung Do you still consider me a general? I want to lead the battle tomorrow We've been through a lot. It's a miracle that we've made it this far. However according to the Chinese proverb if we attempt to live, we die, and if we attempt to die, we live Let us trust each other, and unite Even if we all die... Tomorrow they will break the gate and enter If they come in we will use these bombs! Be careful Come here... stand up everyone Tomorrow, we will protect you, your highness Do you wish to become a general of the Great Yuan Empire? I am a free man. Kill me They never took you seriously In order to rebuild the Great Yuan Empire we will need courageous warriors like you ~ the morning mountain at home, white birds are singing ~ ~ I want to hear the song, and wish to go back home~ ~ I want to hear the song, and wish to go back home~ Sir, you resemble my father who has passed away The Koreas and the HAN's look very much alike We're like brothers This has dragged on too long... Everyone must die! Kill them all! Before sunset, lets head back to the prairie. No, no, wait a minute Fire, fire, fire! they're setting fires! Don't move Everyone run for cover General we've failed Daejung.... I always wanted to have an honorable death That's my dream Jaosinwe! Jaosinwe! We must go out and fight together! Dochoong!! Dochoong!! Take the princess outside the fortress, now!! So many warriors have died because of you! Yesol... My son It's too dangerous You can't cross the sea with that boat I still have to try. "Only those on journeys will see the dim roads that lead the way home"
