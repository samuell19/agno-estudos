"I love you" God knows who spoke these words for the first time. And to whom. Whenever somebody repeated these words of love innocent people got enraptured. Chandni! Hurry up, or the work will never be finished! And the upper storey is still not decorated! Careful! Careful! Listen, this pavilion isn't ready yet. Everything will be ready. The flowers are here. The flowers will be adorned here. The chandelier will be put up in the middle. Don't spoil the flowers! What are you guys doing? Come on! Hurry up! The halogen bulbs will be put up here. And the festoons there. You take the flowers and give me the turmeric. I will apply it with my own hands. Listen, today brother is coming! Did you send somebody to the station? I have sent Anand. Guess who it is! Who am I? The one who can't be seen in the daylight. My dear child... Chandni. What was the need to recognise me so easily, aunt? Dear! As long as the girl is not married she is easily recognised. And when she gets married then her family becomes unfamiliar. I have come for Neelu's marriage. And here you are planning my marriage. I don't want to marry. Look, after putting up the festoons put up the chandelier. And... How are you, aunt? I am fine. But why are you being impatient? -What? -Already you have applied turmeric. Shall we get you married too? -I won't marry. -Chandni! -How are you? -I am fine. God bless you! -Where is Neelu? -Upstairs. In her room. Sister-in-law, couldn't you have come 4 days earlier? What to do, Manju! There was so much work. Yes. Had work! He should get a leave too. You always make some excuse. -Chandni! My Chandni! -Leave! From being my sister, you have become a guest. You came only two days earlier. I will answer your complaints only if you leave me. Why are you holding my dirty clothes? Chandni (Moonlight) can never be dirty. Oh, my God! What was this explosion? This is not an explosion. This is how he comes home. Who is this noisy guy? Brother Anand's best friend. Rohit. Who has tied this pavilion so loosely! Sir, I have tied it. -You? -Yes. Will you put up this dirty pavilion for Rohit Gupta's sister's wedding? Now you won't see this pavilion anywhere, sir. Won't be seen! lmmediately change it! Change all of it! Quickly! Come here! Has the flower vendor arrived? Neelu! Neelu, check whether my baggage has arrived upstairs or not! Please give me my clothes! We didn't meet for a year! So now you are acting so formally. Now all my clothes are yours only! Yippee! Where is Chandni? I don't know where she is roaming around! ♪ I am wearing nine bangles ♪ Beloved, wait.

So that there is sufficient light for me to see you and you to see me. When God created you... then maybe... He too must have felt tempted once. I think you don't know how pretty you are. So pretty that the word beautiful is a small word to describe your beauty. People twist words. But I will tell the truth. I love you so much. I doubt whether anybody has loved someone so much. And by now you too must have fallen in love with me. Tell me. Yes or no? Let me tell you one more thing. People from Delhi know how to rule the country and the heart. I will surely win your heart. In Shahjanpur nobody spoke to me like this. I was my fair mother's fair daughter. There too my heart used to beat. But in Delhi my heart is beating so fast. I was a simple village girl. When the time to bid the bride farewell arrived I started wailing so loudly. Crying I embraced my grandma and said "Grandma, I don't know anything." "What will happen, mother? I don't know anything." Chandni, come! You too hear this story! No teacher in the world can teach you this. Yes, Chandni! Come and sit beside brother Anand. Come. Here. Aunt, you were telling us about your honeymoon. Dear, in our times we used to have a small room. I was bored sitting there. Then your uncle came in the room. Now only I and he were in the room. Both of us were ignorant fools. Seeing me, he pinched me. What happened to you? 55 years ago he pinched me and today you are screaming. Nothing! Nothing, aunt! Aunt, the romance has just started. Say yes or no. Listen, then your uncle slowly grabbed my hand. Leave! This is just what I said! Then what happened, aunt? What was to happen? He carried me in his arms. Then! Then! Then! Answer me! I know you are being very impatient. But do you know? Nothing happened. He turned his face and slept. And I turned my face and slept on the other side. Aunt, it means... Nothing happened? For 6 years this continued. Something happened when I turned 16 years old. And he turned 18 years old. Aunt, we live in a jet world. Everything is instant. Like instant food, instant coffee, instant tea, instant love. Am I right, brother Rohit? Yes. Incidentally everything is instant. If there is an accident we say seasons do change but the spring has now arrived. Yes or no? Brother Rohit, you are right. Very soon your will find your love. Say, yes or no? Will you serve us something or only ask? I am giving it. Henna is being applied on my hand. And your face is glowing, Chandni! This colour is like rainbow. It can be seen. But you can't catch it. If the bride gives her henna adorned hands to an unmarried girl then she gets married soon. Nonsense! And what if a guy quickly grabs that girl's hand? They both fall in love, brother Rohit! -Am I right, Chandni? -Nonsense! Hey! Thank you! Here are the wedding pictures! Look! Why are you all pouncing on it? The wedding procession has left. But the pictures are not going anywhere. But you are in haste, brother. You are insisting that you will leave by this evening's train. You all... you all are leaving today? Dear, because of my job. Daddy, Neelu's wedding pictures. Brother, Chandni's holidays are still not over. Neelu has gone to her in-law's house. If Chandni had stayed here for sometime then we wouldn't have felt so lonely. Wealth and daughter don't stay at one place for long. If she wants, she can stay back. Listen! Let's go and pack bags! Yelling is of no avail. Here. I am coming. I will pack the bags. -Chandni! -What happened, aunt? You are staying, aren't you? Yes, aunt! -Are you happy? -Yes. I am really happy. You are my dear niece. That's why I am making you stay here. So that I could shower my love on you. Aunt, does she only know how to take love or give love too? If there is some space in her heart then I too will try. Quiet, shameless! While jesting you don't even see who is standing in front of you. -Manju! -Coming! Don't people in Delhi have any shame? If I feel coy then I will only hoist the flag on Kutub Minar all my life. If I don't feel shy only then will I get married. Yes or no? You are talking about marriage. And you pretended to be clicking my picture. There is not even one picture of mine. First say yes or no. What if I say no? Then I won't come on a horse. Then will you come on a donkey? No! I will... Rohit! No, Rohit! I am feeling scared. I am there! I will die! I won't let you die without hearing your answer! -I will fall down! -Then come closer. -I am scared. -Then hold me tightly. -Rohit! -Say yes or no! -Rohit, please! -Yes or no! -Yes! -Say it louder! I didn't hear it! -Yes! Yes! Yes! -Yes! ♪ Beloved! ♪ Beloved! ♪ I had heard about Delhi ♪ from all the cities ♪ In Delhi I met ♪ a girl named Chandni ♪ I lost my heart ♪ to her alluring eyes ♪ She became my... ♪ She is my... ♪ You are my beloved ♪ Beloved! ♪ I had heard about ♪ Delhi from all the cities ♪ In Delhi I met a ♪ girl named Chandni ♪ I lost my heart ♪ to her alluring eyes ♪ She became my... ♪ She is my... ♪ You are my beloved ♪ Beloved! ♪ I saw you and at ♪ first sight I knew ♪ That you are my beloved ♪ I recognised you ♪ I saw you and at ♪ first sight I knew ♪ That you are my beloved ♪ I recognised you ♪ The one whom I searched for ♪ in my dreams and thoughts ♪ You became my... ♪ You became my... ♪ I am your beloved ♪ Beloved! ♪ I don't know what others think ♪ Forget what others think ♪ This is God's will ♪ I don't know what others think ♪ Forget what others think ♪ This is God's will ♪ Now nobody else ♪ will come between us ♪ You became my... ♪ You became my... ♪ You are my beloved ♪ I am your beloved ♪ You are my beloved ♪ I had heard about ♪ Delhi from all the cities ♪ In Delhi I met ♪ a girl named Chandni ♪ I lost my heart to ♪ her alluring eyes ♪ She became my... ♪ She is my... ♪ You are my beloved ♪ I am your beloved ♪ You are my beloved ♪ I am your beloved ♪ You are my beloved ♪ I am your beloved When you come again? When... when you will call me. I will write you a letter. Give me your address. No, no! What if mother finds out? You must be having a friend. I can write to her. Yes. Kiran Mathur. -20, Shahjanpur. -Chandni! Chandni! Letter for you! Your beloved's letter! -What! -Your letter! Kiran, give it to me! Kiran, look! Don't harass me! Please give me the letter! First I will read it! It arrived on my address. So I have the right to read it. Look, as per the agreement between you and me I will read the letter and you will hear. Fine? Hold this! Hey! Deceiver! Wait! Let the second letter arrive. Then I will show you! Chandni. Shall I call you a breeze of wind or the desire of time? Shall I call you heartbeats or the fragrant breath? When I think about you, flowers blossom. When the sun rises it feels as if you are swaying your tresses covered with dew drops. And I am kissing your eyes. In the warm sunlight it feels as if the moonlight has descended on earth. The setting sun showers red flowers on you. And your fragrance makes my body aromatic. At night, I swear on you, I miss you a lot. The full moon forgets the sky and looks at your beauty. I close my eyes and I can see you in my heart. Yours, only yours, Rohit. Rohit, what to write? Its like time has come to a standstill. Breeze, fragrance, trees everything is waiting for me to write something. But how to express what lies in my heart? Rohit, here there is everything that you like. Jasmine. Burning light. And your Chandni. I wish you were here. But how can you be here? But still you are there. In my breath, in my heart, in my heartbeat. Our heartbeats will become one, Chandni. Tomorrow mummy and daddy are arriving. I will talk to them about our alliance. You want to marry that girl you met in the wedding! She is not of our stature! She is not of our caste! You want to bring her to this house! You want to make her our daughter-in-law? What are you people talking? I am not the first man in the world who is doing this, daddy! When we go to buy furniture we see whether it will look good in the house or not. Thank you, mummy. Thank you very much. You consider the woman whom I love as a piece of furniture. This word, "love", has been used so many times that it has lost its importance! Why do you forget that she will come in this house as the daughter-in-law? We will have to live with her! Mother, understand one thing! I am not marrying her for you! And I don't believe in family background, caste, creed, social norms and stature! But... I have not come to take your permission. I have not come to ask you people. I have just come to tell you that I am marrying Chandni. But... Now you just have to decide whether you will give us your blessing or not. -That's it! -But... Think about it. Daddy, stop brother Rohit! If he married Chandni then how will I face the society? Pooja, what society are you talking about? Where people's respect is judged by their bank balance. That girl won't come in this house, Ramesh! They both are mismatched! Mother, that was the case when I came in this house as a son-in-law. And how will you stop Rohit? He is a guy of this generation. He is your only son. Someday he will break all the ties. Are you people ready? Ramesh, try to understand! Marriages are conducted amongst people of equal stature. After all we have to live in this society. Mother, your society has accepted me. So in the future your society will accept Chandni too. Rohit knows that he is our only son. We can't go against his wishes. He is taking advantage of this. Let it be. You talk to Mr. Shiv! -What... -Yes! Ramesh, bear one thing in mind. The marriage should take place according to our stature.

This guy has tarnished our image! Daughter-in-law is the honour of the house! She should be shy and coy! She keeps the honour of the house intact. I don't know from where she has come! Daddy, she will entertain us. We will get to see her dances. Not just we, even the neighbours will be entertained. I say cancel this alliance! There is still time! Cancel this alliance! Why are you people after her? She didn't want to dance. Your dear son provoked her. While trying to save your honour you might lose your son. Tomorrow they are coming with the auspicious gifts. So cheer up your mood. -What did he say? -Nothing. Goodnight. Congratulations! Celebrations! Wow! Wow! Engagement! Take a picture! Mother, you are forgetting your future daughter-in-law. God bless you, son. This is your future daughter-in-law's day too. So bless her too. Yes, yes. God bless you, dear. This ring contains our love and best wishes. God bless you, dear. Jewellery's worth is known by the person who wears it, mother. And love is priceless. Jewellery's worth is known also by the one who gives it. -Yes. -Here. Give it to her. Come on. Give it to her, Rohit. Yes! Give him your hand! Wow! Wow! Very good! Pooja, won't you give Chandni any gift? Why not? How can I forget my future sister-in-law? I thought she likes dancing. So what gift can be better than this? I like dancing but... Pooja, only you could have given this gift on this auspicious occasion. A brother will always remember this gift given by his sister. Thank you. Asha! What happened? Why are you dejected? I am thinking about the future, sister. Chandni will feel choked in that house. I didn't know they will behave like this. I don't know what they think of themselves. They are rich people. They are proud of their wealth. We are not imploring to anybody. We are happy the way we are. Why are you quarrelling? Look at Chandni. Think about her happiness. I know that Rohit will take good care of her. And I also believe that nobody can be upset with our Chandni for long. Let them get married. She will win everybody's heart. God wills this is what happens. How is that? Are you mad? -You got scared! Coward! -Why are you laughing? -Close your eyes! -What! Close your eyes! What will you do after I close my eyes? I am a girl. What can I do with you? You are not trustworthy. I see! So now you don't trust me! I think today I am going to be raped! Now will you close your eyes or not? Quiet! Why? -Close your eyes! -Okay! -Open your mouth! -Open my mouth? Yes! Taste this and say what this is. It's 'Barfi' (Kind of sweets). -Wow! -It's nice! -Now say what is this? -What? Glucose biscuit. -Come on! You are superb! -I know! You don't have to tell me! Now this. Caught it! What is this? It's 'Ladoo' (Kind of sweets). I can't believe it! Now let me see. Don't open your eyes. My eyes are close. Close. What is this! Chilli! ldiot! Fool! -You didn't say what this is! -I... Water! For me can't you even eat a chilli? What kind of love is this? In your love I can even consume poison! -You got a hot chilli like you! -No, no, no! -Chandni, where are you going? -Chandni, come here! Chandni! Chandni! Come here! Sit here! Sit! Sit! -Sit! -O God! I am so sorry. -Chandni! -Yes! After marriage we won't stay here even for a day. You see, your parents, my relatives. You know, maternal aunt, maternal uncle... Aunt and uncle! They bore a lot after marriage. They will invite us to their house. And waste our time. So what do you want? I want to take you far away from here. Where there is only you and me. And nobody else. Right on! Chandni, we will go to Switzerland for our honeymoon. Hey! What happened? Where are you? Switzerland! Right! Hold it! Hold it! Hey! Hey! Hey! Chandni, what are you doing? What? With your love I can spend all my life. -Chandni! -Yes! -Come here! -Why? Come! I feel like kissing you! I didn't hear! Why are you spoiling my romantic mood? Come! There is an old joke. A fat man wants to love a beautiful girl. The girl said... catch me. And then you can love me. So? So, fatso? Won't you kiss me? I am dead. I can't give any answer! Is that so? I will bring you back to life. Hands up! Don't move! Otherwise I will shoot! Don't do that! I am my wife's only husband! What will happen to her? Don't talk too much! Give me all that you have! -Everything? -Yes. -Hurry up! -Hang on! Hang on! -Don't try to run away! -No. No. I have 3 frank. You can have it. You are in Switzerland. And you have only 3 frank. Aren't you ashamed? I don't know anything. I want to do shopping. What shopping. Aren't you fed up of shopping? Like a fool I am roaming on the lanes with these bags! Let's go to hotel. Let's do some romance. No drama! Quickly give me the money! Come to the hotel. I will give you everything. -Promise? -Promise! -Fine! Hold this pistol. And popcorn. -Sure. -And give me 3 frank. -Let it be with me. -For ice-cream. -Of course. Let's go. You have to keep up your promise. Otherwise I will shoot you. Get lost! Showing me fake pistol you want to rob me of real money. ♪ You will have to ♪ fulfil your promise. Again shopping! Come on! Come! Come! -Hey! Can I taste it? -Sure! Yummy! Too good! -Can I... -What? -Can I... -Get lost! You eat half of mine! And now it's your turn and you are saying get lost! -Get lost! -Give it to me! -Why should I give it to you? -Give me a bite!

Good children don't do mischief. In this chilly weather if we won't do mischief then what else will we do? Really! Today it's very cold! Let's do one thing. In the hotel I will give you cognac. What? Cognac? Meaning brandy? Cognac is liquor! No, no! Cognac is not liquor! -Cognac is not liquor? -No! Cognac is not liquor! Come! -Cheers! -Cheers! -Oh, my God! Cognac... -is not liquor!

Quickly give me a kiss! Aunt has come! Hello! Why do aunts interfere in love? Hello. Where were you? You took so long to answer the phone! I was in the bathroom. What were you doing? Come on, Rohit! Tell me! What were you doing? I was taking a bath! What else? What happened? O God! I am drenched. Bye. Hello! Listen! What are you doing? Talking to you. What were you doing before that? I was looking at myself in the mirror. Did you like my Chandni? Today I feel so much love on myself. And don't you feel like loving me? Why don't you understand? I love you. That's why I like myself. Oh, my Chandni! I love you, darling! Rohit, when you call me yours I feel proud of myself. Now what? Chandni, I want to meet you this evening. But where? On your house's terrace. My house's terrace? Yes. And I will wait for you. Fine. I will come. But... come as my Chandni! What do you mean? Wearing white clothes. From head to toe. Okay. Bye. See you. Rohit! Chandni! Chandni! Look up! Chandni! Oh, my God! Rohit, you are mad! Yes, I am mad! I love you, Rohit! What are you doing? I love you! I love you too! O God! What are you doing? Rohit, you are mad! Chandni, it's my style! Bye! Carefully! Rohit! Rohit, please come back! Ro... Rohit! Chandni, Ramesh here! Rohit has met with an accident! He fell down from the helicopter while landing. He is admitted in Ambadlal hospital. Brother Ramesh! Brother Ramesh, what happened? What has happened? Don't worry, Chandni! Everything will be fine. Where is Rohit? Can I meet him? -Not now! -Not now! What do the doctors say? -Nothing can be said, Chandni! -What! Is he very serious? He is in the operation theatre. His surgery is going on. Mummy, do you know how this accident took place? No! How? Because of her! She likes flowers! To please her brother Rohit gathered flowers from all over the city. He was showering flowers on her when this accident took place. It happened because of you! What do you want? Why don't you leave? I can't leave without seeing Rohit, without meeting him. No! You won't meet him! You won't see him! Leave! Aunt, once... let me see Rohit just once. Then I will do whatever you say. Let me meet Rohit once. Daddy! Rohit has regained consciousness. Chandni, he has regained consciousness. Come, quick! Rohit! Rohit! -Chandni. -What has happened, Rohit? You were looking so pretty from that height. -Come, my Chandni. -Rohit! -Chandni! -What happened, Rohit? Rohit! What's the matter? Tell me! -My right hand and right leg are not moving. -What are you... What has happened to me, doctor? Actually your right side is paralysed. Doctor, will I be able to walk or not? Will I ever get well? You will surely get well. You just need your will power and your inner strength. Rohit! Rohit! You will have to get well! God has saved you for me. Now your life is mine. Wow! Welcome! Welcome! Smiling face! Black tresses! Wow! Chandni, take me to my room. Thank you. I must say! Rohit's arrival has brightened this house! -Shall I tell you something, Chandni? -Yes. The nurses in the hospital were very beautiful. If I had stayed there for a few more days I would have won her heart. But you and I were in a hurry to return home. Rohit! Why did you become quiet? Hearing the voices of the past it feels as if time has come to a standstill. Don't stop time. Let it move on. Will we relive those days, Chandni? Yes, Rohit. We will. I have complete faith. Your faith is my life. And your life is my life. Today if I ask something from you then promise me you won't refuse. Do you think I will refuse? Your every word is my promise. Chandni, whenever I open my eyes.. ..I want to see you in front of me. From today my dawn will begin with your smile. And my dusk will begin by looking at you. What are you doing here? Mummy! Can't you see? She is preparing breakfast for Rohit. Are we dead, that you are making breakfast for my son? Before marriage she is establishing her right on this house. She comes here every morning. She is so shameless. Not shameless, mother! She is very cunning! She knows that if she wins brother Rohit's heart then all the wealth will be hers. Do you hear what we are saying? Mummy, she thinks that like this she can take us away from brother Rohit. Everybody is slandering us! You have still not married him. And day and night you hover around Rohit. No matter what you do, you won't be the owner of this house. Girl, leave! Stop! Keep the tray back! What am I saying! Beware if you entered the kitchen again! Chandni. Don't cry so easily, Chandni. Your tears will get over. Here nobody values your tears. You gave up so soon. You have to win this battle. What should I do, brother Ramesh? Aunt gets upset at every matter. And Pooja is like my sworn enemy. Actually they all want you to give up and leave this place forever. Don't they want Rohit to be happy? They want his joy. But such a joy which includes their choice too. And you are not their choice. Look, Chandni. If Rohit saw you crying then he will break up. So tolerate them. Endure it. Quietly. Smilingly. Endure everything. If not for yourself then for Rohit, for his life. You are right, brother Ramesh.

Do you know what you are saying? She is right! She has created a scene in the house! Since the time this unlucky girl has come in this house my son's life has been ruined. This witch has cast a spell on him! What are you people saying? Somebody listen to me! Rohit! You are not well, son! You need rest! Daddy, Pooja accused Chandni that she... I want peace in this house! But what is Chandni's fault in this? Ramesh, you always.. Daddy! Daddy, I am fine! No need to scream! Pooja is unnecessarily.. Son, you rest! Pooja, take him inside. No need. I can go on my own. Listen to me carefully. Rohit is my only son. I don't want to lose him because of you. This girl is so shameless. Even after hearing all this, she is still standing here! -She is not leaving! -Mother, keep quiet! Now you... -It's enough! -Yes! Chandni, now leave. They will not let you live. Good morning! Good morning, Rohit! Good morning! Are you angry with me? No. Rohit, I have got something for you. Close your eyes. I will give it to you and you have to guess what it is. What's the need to close my eyes? I won't give you chilli. Give it like this. Don't you trust me, Rohit? I don't trust myself. You did trust yourself till yesterday. There is a huge difference between yesterday and today. What's the difference? Yesterday was a dream. And today is reality. Dream, reality, yesterday, today? What are you saying? I don't understand anything. Why don't you try to understand? I am not that person whom you had loved? With whom you had sang songs and danced! How long will I please my heart with the memories of the past? Rohit! Why are you being so emotional? Only my emotions are left. The rest... the rest... all the dreams have shattered. Dreams have not shattered, Rohit. Our dreams will come true. On this wheelchair? With this weak, crippled, helpless Rohit? You can't use such words for yourself as long as I am there. If you can fight with your parents, this society, everybody for me, then can't I be your leg? I will be your better half in the true sense. I will be your hope, your strength, your faith. Why don't you try to understand? Rohit. Who did all this? I did it. You? Yes. Now I don't need these pictures and the memories linked to them. Rohit, don't say that. Already our love is facing difficult times. That is not love! It's pity! Pity! And I don't want anybody's pity! Rohit! Rohit, what has happened to you? How did you change so much in just one night? Now there is no place for your love in my life. It's not so easy to erase love, Rohit. I am not lifeless like these pictures. I am a girl. I have a heart which beats. I have feelings. I have a mind to think. By covering these pictures which are the memento of our love you have expressed your hatred. You and your pictures remind me of those moments which I can't forget! Your beauty, your smile, your youth mocks me! Your entertaining and amusing me reeks of pity! You want me to be dependent on you! No! It's better to die than to live such a life! No. Don't say that, Rohit. Your life is dearer to me than anything else. Rohit, I know that today there is hatred and not love in your heart. Still I ask you one question. If I had been in your place and you had been in my place then what would you do? I would have left you a long time ago! Rohit! I pity your narrowness. You don't even know the value of love! Love is the gift of God! Not rich people's alms! You are talking about that Chandni ..who was your breath, your heartbeat. Your love. The love which you are talking about what has it given me? You have received everything! -Family, fame, wealth! -Rohit! And I have just received bitterness.. humiliation.. ..restlessness! It has snatched the solace of my heart. And the Chandni which you are talking about.. ..she has made me a crippled instead of giving me life. What? You too are accusing me. That I made you crippled! Yes! Till now only my family and the people said it! But today I too say that you have crippled me! Physically, emotionally, mentally! Fine, Rohit. When like your family and others you too believe that I have made you crippled.. then I don't have the right to live in this house. And I don't have any right on you. I am taking the gift of your hatred with me. You live with this hatred. I will live with my love. Father, return them their wealth and my love. Here is your prized possession! This is what you wanted, isn't it? Here! You must be feeling very great now! You should be ashamed! The Chandni that was motivation of your live the every reason of your existence! You broke your relations with her. Can I know the reason of this behaviour of yours! What's the use of digging up old graves, brother Ramesh? What's the use? I know Rohit, that you love Chandni a lot. But can I tell you something. You have given her such a pain she will remember it all her life. At least we fulfilled our love. You were ready to stand up against the entire world for her. But now I don't understand why you did this? You want to know, brother Ramesh. Because, I am shattered. You know the people in this house. They don't have any place for Chandni in their hearts. Only I could have stood up for her. Anyone that could have supported her held her close, that was me. While I was standing on my feet, I was her shield. But now that shield has shattered, brother Ramesh, what am I now? A helpless cripple Who can't do anything on his own. That's fine Rohit. But was it necessary to break her heart? Until I wouldn't have broken her heart or insulted her she wouldn't have left me. I didn't want ruin her life, brother Ramesh. And your life? What is left for me now, brother Ramesh? I have lost everything. A strong gust of wind ruined everything. Now even Chandni has left. ♪ Chandni! ♪ Oh, my Chandni ♪ You are my Chandni! ♪ With the colourful ambience ♪ With the kohl of your eyes ♪ I have written yourname on my heart Chandni!

Chandni, you didn't tell us you were coming. I would have come to the station to pick you up. I didn't want to trouble you. Aren't you ashamed to say that? Brij, Chandni will stay with us. Do you need to say that? Who else does she have in Mumbai other than us? So, all those who don't have anyone will stay in my house! That's not possible! All I want is a small place to live. I will be greatly indebted to you. If you want to stay here, you will have to pay a rent of 100 rupees. Excluding the electricity and water bill. -Do you accept it? -Yes, I do. And yes, I don't have a separate room. You can stay somewhere here. Chandni, how did all this happen? You can say that someone cast an evil eye. I don't know why I couldn't control all the happiness. Now neither can I forget him or think about him. Still, whenever I think about it it makes me cry. I am telling you. You will surely get a job today. While leaving, bow in front of Lord Ganesha. With the grace of Lord, you will get the job. Come on, drink this tea and get ready. Stop! Auto! Taxi! Stop! What are you doing? What is this misbehaviour? I am very sorry, this is my helplessness. Please don't look at me, drive the car. I will tell you everything. Please. -You are... -I have come from Delhi! I am a stranger in your city. I am looking for a job. I have to go for an interview, but I am very late. I will be greatly indebted to you. Please take me to this address. This one, down here. You do know where I have to go, isn't it? Have you understood? Why don't you say something? Get down. You felt bad. I am sorry... No, no this is building where you have to go. Thank you. Thank you very much! And listen. I am sure you will get this job. Thank you. Excuse me, sir. Yes, please. Sir, someone wants to see you. Yes, sir. You can go in through this door. Thank you, sir. May I come in, sir? Yes, come in. Sir. You, sir. Are you amazed to see me? I was scared before coming here. But after seeing you, I am feeling courageous. Good. -Sit. -It's alright sir. This is a travel agency. We take people around the world. That means you fulfil the dreams that they see. No one ever said such things about this profession. Thank you. Yes, speaking. Yes! It will be done. Not to worry. Anyway, you will have to given an interview. Yes. My name is Chandni Mathur. I am a B.A. graduate. I know shorthand typing. I don't have any experience in work. But I promise, if you will give me this job then I will work honestly and diligently. If you say so, then I believe you. Mr. Verma, come here. Yes, sir. Mr. Verma, this is Ms. Chandni Mathur. From today, she will work in our office. Tell her about my personal file and tickets. Okay, sir. Thank you, sir. -Hello! -Chandni! Really! What has happened to the both of you? -I am very happy today Tara-bai! -Why? With the grace of God, I have found a job. Now I can breathe freely, be happy.. and live. I can't believe it. -Yes, sir. -Sit. Look, some of my clients are arriving today. I am very busy. They are our old and important clients. I want you to take them on dinner and entertain them. I am sorry sir, I cannot do this. You cannot do it, I didn't understand? Sir, this is not my job. It's not a part of my duty. Not a part of your duty? You are telling me what your duty is, and what's not. While asking for a job you had promised any job that you will given, you will do it faithfully. Listen, young lady. Every task in this office is a part of your duty. But I don't think it is good thing. My God, you don't think it is a good thing. That's the bad thing in middle class girls like you. You decide it before hand, what's good and what's not. The bad thoughts are in your mind. It's in your mind. Our clients should be happy with us, prove their efficiency! We get business from them. This office runs on that. You get salary because of that. Do you understand? No sir. This is my order. I am sorry sir, I cannot do it. If you can't do it, then get lost! It is too much. He is so rude. Madam, sir has sent this. Sorry. What does he think of himself? Mr. Verma, book a table for 4 at Taj for dinner. Chandni has arrived too. That's a very grand reception party. Are they waiting for me? There has been a raid in the colony today. Raid? Yes. It's a government colony. Illegal tenants are not allowed. That means people like us. -Then? -Then what? We will spend the night somewhere and return in the morning. Until then, the raid will be over too. Brij, I haven't seen Mumbai till now. Come on, let us go and see Mumbai. -Good idea, let's go. -Come on. -Come on. -That's a good idea. Brij, we should have a party like this once a month. Don't worry, the government is very happy with us. It will keep happening. Good! Kiran, come on, let's get drenched in the rain. -What are you saying? -Come. Come! -Chandni! -Chandni! Come back. -We are already drenched! -Go! Go! -Come back! -Go! Chandni! What are you doing? Sir, you. Don't you feel ashamed? You pose to be so respected in the office. And now, in the midnight all alone on the road. Kiran! Kiran, come quickly. This is my friend, Kiran! And her husband, Brij! Hello! We are paying guests in the government colony. -There has been a raid there, today. -Yes. That's why we are forced to go on a picnic. Yes. Because, tonight we are homeless and helpless. Then come to my house. Your house? No. Please! My mother will be very happy to meet all of you. Come, come! Come. Meet my mother. Mother... Come. Mother, this is Chandni. -She works in my office. -Greetings. Greetings. Sorry! And she is her friend, Kiran and he is her husband... Brij. Brij. Sorry, I forgot your names. That's all right. Lali, since when did you become so good? Seeing my loneliness, you have brought guests home. Isn't it? Mother, I am trying to be a bit good. And it was their helplessness too. Really! Thank you very much, Lalit. You are welcome mother. Consider this your own house. -I will go and change. -Thank you. Would you like to have coffee? -On one condition. -What? I will prepare the coffee and all of you will drink it. Accepted. Be ready, you wouldn't have tasted such a bad coffee in all your life. -I am witness to that. -Shut up. Why are you ruining my reputation? The kitchen is this way. Kiran, there is a room this way, freshen up. -Thank you. -Yes. Mother, tell me one thing. Don't you feel, as if we are the owners of this house and you are the guest? I feel exactly like that. Isn't it? Dear, come here. Will you hit me? I will hit you. Come here. You a very sweet girl. Sir, if you don't mind can I say something. Yes. You are something at the office and something else at home. Chandni, one form is for the world and another is for myself. Sir, do you like the rains? Rains. I like it a lot. I just love it. This is so much fun. Shall we go, Chandni? Come on, let's go. -Good night, mother. -Good night. -Good night. -Good night. -Good night. -Good night. ♪ It's the monsoon season again ♪ My heart is suffering again ♪ It's the monsoon season again ♪ The ambience was same when we met ♪ Our hearts blossomed ♪ It's the same season, ♪ but not the same ambience ♪ The monsoon is crying along ♪ with me ♪ It's the monsoon season again ♪ Someone please ease my heart ♪ Please gather all the pieces ♪ of my shattered heart ♪ But all this is just an illusion ♪ Once shattered, ♪ it cannot be brought back again ♪ It's the monsoon season again ♪ My heart is suffering again ♪ It's the monsoon season again You couldn't fall asleep, or did I wake you up? If I would have fallen asleep tonight then I would have lost something. I have lost something too, and I am searching for it. Do you keep awake at nights like this? It's my fate to stay awake at nights. It seems like you have invited sufferings for yourself. When you don't have any solution for your pains then your pain becomes your solution. Sir, do you agree that pain lessen when you share it. To share the pain, Chandni! You will have to make a long journey. I will have to relive all the moments again. It is very difficult to relive those painful moments again. Where should I start from? Beautiful. Who are you talking about? What do you think? Let's play a game. What game? I will guess three things about you. -And you guess about me. -Okay. First thing, you never fell in love with anyone. Correct. You have managed a very big business at a very small age. Are you a spy or an astrologer? A very big incident is going to occur in your life. You are wrong here. That incident has already taken place. Now you guess three things about me. Devika, all I would like to say is that. I am very lonely. It is empty. Fill this void with your love. I want to live this life along with you see it from your point of view. How many days will you be away? Why do you ask? We just met, and you are leaving. It's just a matter of a few days. What should I get for you? There is a person, his name is Lalit. Tell him, that I cannot live without him. Bring him along as soon as possible. Don't worry about that. If he is even a bit careless towards you. Then I will lift him on my shoulders and throw him at your feet! His place is not near my feet, it's in my heart. I love you Devika. -Lalit. -Yes, sweetheart. -Will you listen to me? -Why are you asking? First you promise me. I promise. Promise me, that you will look after yourself. And at the right time, you will marry a girl who is more beautiful than me. Why are you punishing me? I am not punishing you. Life is beautiful, and I have very little time. You are under my oath, under the oath of my love. Yes Devika, I promise. I swear on you, on your love. Now I don't want anything else from life. Now my life is fulfilled. Lalit. And she died. I can still feel the touch of her hand, the warmth of her breath. Whenever I imagine her smiling face it shatters me. Life is so unjust! It is so unfair! You can say that living life has become a habit and nothing else. Nothing else. -Lali! -Yes. I liked Chandni a lot. Mother, you like every girl. Seeing her has given rise to some desires. I like Chandni a lot. Is it of any use? Lali, people die when they have to. But you have to still live on. I agree, we have to live on. Look at me, your father passed away. Am I not alive? Son, I am alive only because of you. And I am alive for you. And what after me? Don't say that mother. Fine. You are smart, my son. If you are alive because of me then you will listen to me. Come. -Good morning sir. -Good morning. Chandni, come here. Yes, sir. Chandni, book a first class ticket for Zurich and prepare the visa papers. And all this work should be done quickly. But on what name will the ticket be, sir? Lalit Khanna. You are going out, sir? Yes, there is a conference. I will have to go for 10-12 days. That's all, sir? Can you tell me one thing? Seeing you at home yesterday why did I feel that you are not a stranger for me. -There can be one reason for it, sir. -What? We are strangers when we meet for the first time. Sometimes, I see my pain in your eyes. Sir, I think every person in this world is alone. They need a companion, a destination. Till yesterday, this city was unknown for me. But yesterday, at your house I felt, this is my own city. -Chandni. -Yes. I don't know anything about your life. My name is Chandni Mathur. I am a B.A graduate. I work in Hansraj travel agency. After that, life has come to a stand still. Life should go on. Sir, I... Thank you. Hello! I have been waiting for you for a long time. Really? There is a party in the office.. ..I have to collect the contribution from you. Oh. Here is 100 rupees, fine. You will remember me. Thank you. Come in. I'm sorry, sir. Get lost.

Chandni! How long will you deceive yourself Rohit? You are alive because of her memories! You can still feel the warmth of her breath! The fragrance of her tresses, the brightness of her face is immersed in your heart. There isn't a single moment when you don't think about her. You call her at nights slyly to hear her voice. Your heart beats because of her memories. You are right, brother Ramesh. Chandni is still my life. She is my reason to live, she is my love. And today.. Even today she can come back to you. Yes. I remember, brother Ramesh, the first time I met her. I made her fly in the air. I swept her off her feet. I want to do that again, brother Ramesh. I want to be fine, brother Ramesh! I want to be alright. -I want to be alright. -You will be alright. I want to be fine! Whatever you want, that will happen. Don't worry, I will call up the hospital in Switzerland. Did you talk to Chandni? Not now mother! -Why? -What's the hurry? Not you, I am in a hurry. I have waited for a long time. If you don't, then I will. Mother, these days you are behaving childish. I am telling the truth, I will call her right now. And I will ask her, "when will you come in this house as my daughter-in-law". I swear on you mother, I will talk to her as soon as I return from the conference. No! Today and right now. Mother, you are blackmailing me. You can say that. Fine, today as soon as I get a chance in the party I will talk to her. Now are you happy. That's a good boy. -Chandni! -Yes. You are not dancing? I don't know how to dance. But why aren't you dancing? If I say, I don't know how to dance. Then? Then I will believe it. There is one thing common between us. What's that, sir? Both of us lie very well. There is another thing common. What is that? We talk very well. Then come, let us talk. Sir, I will defeat you in conversation. How can you say that you will win in conversing? Seeing you, it feels like either you have lost your tongue.. ..or you are fed up of talking. -Chandni, -Yes! My mother likes you a lot. I like her a lot too. Please keep meeting with her in my absence.. ..she won't be bored. And me too. -Chandni, -Yes. There is a small desire in my heart. Tell me. -I am scared. -Why, sir? You might say no. Sir. Chandni, I want you to come along with me. Till the airport. To see me off. That's all. I was in a good mood today. I would have given you anything you had asked for. I ask for only one thing. Be happy, live a long life. Have a long life. Because you spread happiness everywhere you go. Please don't wish me to be happy, sir. I am very scared of my happiness. It's said, that the moonlight shines only for 4 days. I am sure, you will prove this saying wrong. If I get the chance, then I will change this saying. Excuse me. Sir, it's time for your flight. Come, I will take you to the airport. Mr. Verma, stay here. Look after the staff. -As you wish. -Chandni will see me off. At the airport it seems like, everyone is going out of lndia. Then come along. -You are joking. -No, I am telling the truth. Next time. There is never a next time. Why do you think that? I have lived life, that's why Chandni! -Sir, you always.. -Chandni, I have a name. I will have to build a bit of courage, sir. Then do it. Mr. Lalit. You can do without the mister too. It will take sometime, sir. Mr. Lalit. Chandni! What should I get for you? Return back safe. You don't want anything. I don't want anything. Still. Ok. The Eiffel Tower from Paris, the Big Ben from London, the Statue Of Liberty from New York! I don't have place for these things in my suitcase. -Chandni! -Yes. Will you remember me? Me? Do try! Air India announces the departure of it's flight AI 171 to Zurich! Passengers are requested.. -Your flight has been announced. -Yes. -Bye. -Bye! You still didn't tell me your choice. My choice... I want your choice. I am sure your choice will be Lali's choice. Listen, if you take such a long time to buy one thing, then I have to do a lot of shopping along with you. And then, I have to buy a sari for you too. Sari, for me? No mother, please. If you don't listen to your mother, then I will... Thank you. ♪ O Lord, my heart is restless. ♪ My beloved, is far away. ♪ O Lord, my heart is restless. -Hello. -Hi, Lalit Khanna. -Rohit Gupta. -Nice meeting you. Pleasure is mine. Have you come here for holidaying? -No, I have come here for a business conference. -I see. -And you? -I have come here for treatment. There is one thing. Hearing my mother tongue in a foreign country makes me very happy. That's true, you think about your country in a foreign land. You think about the people you left in the country too. Have you been here for a long time? It has been 4 months and 10 days. But seems an eternity. Have you left someone behind? You can say that I have left my heart back there and this body here is lifeless. Let's do one thing. I have free time and the ambience is right too. Let's talk. So? Come. How should I start, and how should I end it? As I fell in love, life was filled with immense happiness. We broke all bonds, we got engaged too. Then? Then that relation ended. I ended that relation. Why? I don't understand. I had an accident. I became a cripple. I thought my life had been ruined, why should I ruin hers too? That's why, I ended that relation. Now I am waiting for the moment when we will be face to face again. Time will stop! The world will stop! Say something about yourself. My saga is very short. They say, first love can never be forgotten. Even today when I close my eyes. I can see her face. But I had only a few moments of happiness in my fate. She fell so ill that she never recovered. After that, I forgot how to smile. I forgot how to live life. And lost my desire to live. Now my desire to live life has arisen again. A girl has entered my life. Life seems so beautiful. After a long stretch of darkness if you see a small ray of light, then how do you feel? I can understand how it feels. Tell me, who is the girl? How does she look? You have started first, you say first. Come along. -Okay -Cheers. ♪ You tell me, ♪ I will tell you my love story! ♪ Who is she?

It's a miracle, I am absolutely fine brother Ramesh. Wow, that's fantastic news. You can say that it is the effect of someone love, and prayers. Really, when are you returning? Do one thing, reach Mumbai on the 28th. And yes, don't tell the family members. Fine, I will arrive on the 28th! Tell me one thing, how far has your love progressed. I haven't even said "I love you" till now. You live in the jet age, and couldn't even say that much. Remember one thing, friend. In the old times, flowers would do the trick. But these days, "I love" is not enough. Champagne! Buy a gift for her. The more expensive the gift is, saying "I love you" will be easier. Okay. Give me an, Eyes on Eyes! PG! Margarief! Give me a Cilodel! Lalit! Lalit! Here! What is this? Are you tipping me? This is for your "I love you". Look, there is a payphone there, go and talk to her. But.. Look friend, time doesn't wait for anyone. God knows when time might change. Say "I love you" before that. And yes, call her to the airport. I want to see your choice. Come on! Come on! Come on Mumbai code is 009122! There is still time for the flight. Hello! Can you recognise who is speaking? I recognise your voice. Isn't my voice telling you anything? Where are you speaking from? You are changing the topic. From Geneva airport. When are you returning? Today, my flight will leave in a short while. Say I love you. Say it. Listen, I want to tell you something important. We can talk after you come back here. I might not be able to say it in front of you. Your packets are ready, sir. Yes, I am saying it. Say it, don't feel shy. I am saying it. Whom are you talking to? I have found a friend, a very sweet friend. You will be happy to meet him. I will be very happy to meet your friend. He wants to be a part of our happiness. Which happiness does he want to be a part of? I have called to tell you that. Chandni, I love you. Really! I love you! -Are you listening? -Yes. Air India announces the departure.. Chandni, the flight has been announced. And I want you to meet me at the airport. Yes. -You will come to the airport, isn't it? -Yes. I am looking forward to seeing you. Bye. Rohit, I said it. I said that I love her. -Yes! -Yes! And do you know what? She is coming to receive me at the airport. Terrific. Let me see, who the saviour of your life is. Your work is done. But mine is upset with me. If mine is appeased too. Then we will celebrate together. You bring your sweetheart along and I will bring mine along. -Done? -Done. Let's go! Hello! This is Chandni speaking. I want to talk to Rohit. How dare you call here? Aren't you satisfied after ruining this house? I want to talk to Rohit, please. Don't you dare take his name! If you dare call again, then I won't spare you! Why didn't you go to the airport? I didn't go deliberately. You don't want to forget your love. The love that you talk about, what has it given you? Sorrows, troubles! Pain, that's all! Has he ever inquired about you? Has he ever.. ever asked you even once.. ..that, Chandni, how are you? Are you alive, or dead! How long will you lead your life as a lifeless body? How long will you live this way? How long? And his family! Do you still have the strength to prove yourself again? To listen to their abuses. Chandni, learn to look life in the eye. Rohit was past, Lalit is your present. You are very happy. Happy.. Just a minute, Lalit! Do you have local coins, 50 paise? Yes. The phone. Just two 50 paises. Excuse me. That's it. Chandni didn't come. Why isn't someone answering? -Scoundrel! -I will call her too. She didn't come to the airport. Pick up, come on. What happened? No one is picking up the phone. Mine is coming engaged. Brother Ramesh! Hi brother Ramesh! Won't you say something? I forgot everything seeing you. May you live long, and all your desires are fulfilled. Come on Tiger! Just a minute. Lalit! Lalit! Brother Ramesh, this is Lalit! -Hi. -Hello. -Two body, same heart. -Really! This is brother Ramesh! My brother Ramesh, my brother-in-law! -Mother! Mother! -Bless you. -You here. -I felt like coming and meeting my son, so I did. -Mother, this is Rohit. -Greetings. Consider him your other son. -And he.. -Bless you. And he is Rohit's brother-in-law. Greetings. Greetings. So, I am leaving. Oh, yes! Do you remember the meeting? Yes. See you. Come on. It's bloody hot in Mumbai, brother Ramesh. -How was your trip? -Very nice, mother. Successful in every way. -Did you talk to Chandni? -Mother.. I have spoken to her about marriage. Fantastic! Good that you left the house. You are flying in air after this trip. She was supposed to come to the airport. She must be feeling shy. You don't need to feel shy in love. I will barge in her house directly. Did you inform Chandni, that you are coming? The romance will die down, if I inform her. I want to surprise Chandni. But at least take her advice. What's there to take an advice? Tell her to call her parents. Before my parents arrive, please.. ..make all the arrangements for the marriage. Brother Ramesh! I can't even wait for the nuptial rounds. What is the need to find out the auspicious time, son? Everyday of life is auspicious. The day Chandni will come as the bride, that will be an auspicious day. The auspicious day will be when Chandni will be mine. -Has Chandni been meeting you? -Everyday. -How is she? -She is fine, see it for yourself! We have done a lot of shopping for you. Have you done shopping for her? What else have I done? I have brought that ring, which she has returned. I have brought a ring for her too. -It's very beautiful. -Watch. And some perfumes. And for me? -I am bringing a daughter-in-law for you. -Fine. First tell me, why didn't you come to the airport. Just like that. What is the matter? I want to talk to you. Yes, tell me. You told me everything about yourself. But you don't know anything about me. I don't even want to know. I have a past too. I loved someone too. Chandni, I don't want to know anything about your past. -Still if you.. -Chandni. I want to tell you something. Yes. I don't know why, I am scared. What is the matter? What my eyes always conveyed but I could never say it. Chandni, I.. want to marry you. Are you angry? No! Then, are you ready? Yes! Chandni! Chandni, you don't know how happy you have made me. And mother will be so happy to hear this. I never saw Lali so happy ever. It seems like he has conquered all over the world. I gave him birth, but you have given him life. I will always be indebted to you. I want him to be always happy. And I completely trust you. That you will keep Lali very happy. Very happy! What will happen to me, brother Ramesh? What will happen to me? -I am getting very nervous. -Why? Look, I am sweating so much. Oh, my God! What will she say seeing me? Will I be able to say anything or not? I haven't seen her for a long time. What if I fall unconscious after seeing her? It is possible that she might fall unconscious seeing you. -Come on, relax now. -Yes, relax. relax.. Hello. What are you looking at? It's me, Rohit. Not Rohit's ghost. Alive, your Rohit. You are looking good, as usual. You were amazed, isn't it? Now, shall I show you a magic? Ready! 1.. 2.. 3! You were amazed, isn't it? You were astounded, isn't it? Take a look, closely. I can move. I can spin around. I can sit up. I can dance. Wow! How was it? Tell me, how was it? Ask me to come inside. I'm sorry. You completely forgot about me. You must have thought, God knows how Rohit is. Is he still alive, or... No. That's where you were wrong, Chandni. Lovers don't die. They never accept defeat. If love still burns in their hearts then no incident, sorrow or power can separate them. It's true Chandni, the desire to see you, meet you again gave me the power to be alright again. Protected me. And because of your love, I am standing before you. I swear on you, Chandni. I never separated from you. I always thought about you. Yes, once. I have been deceived once. But, I won't be now. Brother Ramesh and I have made all the arrangements for our marriage. And before there is any other interruption in our marriage let us get married. Tell me, yes or no. You are not saying anything. I didn't give you a chance to speak. I have been going on talking. Say something. Tell me. You must have cried a lot without me. You must have cursed me, abused me. Yes, why not. Of course, that must have happened! You also say something. Say something. What to say? Say something. -Rohit -Yes. -I can't believe... -The phone is ringing. Don't you pick up your phone? I was calling from the airport, it was ringing, no one was picking it up. Go on. -Hello. -Chandni, this is Lalit speaking. Yes. -You like the rains a lot, don't you? -Yes. The rains today reminded me of you. Chandni, Take a look at the drops falling in your lawn. In every drop you will see the face of the person that loves you the most in the world. Did you see? You can see me, isn't it? Yes. Chandni, what spell have you cast on mother! Since she has returned from your house she doesn't want to stay here. Yes. And listen, I had said I will introduce you to a friend of mine. We will meet him tomorrow. Fine. Fine. I love you, Chandni. Bye. Mumbai's rains are fantastic, in our Delhi.. What happened, Chandni? Any problem? Whose call was it? Did you find an enemy for me in my absence? Rohit! Chandni! Rohit, someone else has come in my life. I am marrying him. What? What do you mean? That's not possible. This is... This is not possible! You are mine! Only mine! That's great! You cannot punish me! You cannot punish yourself! You cannot punish our love! You can never love anyone else! You belonged to me, you still do and always will be! Understood! My Chandni! Rohit's Chandni! Your, Chandni! Where was your love, the day you broke my heart! Insulted her love! Did you ever try to find out whether Chandni is alive or is she dead! Since that day, do you know how I spent each day? I will ask you a question today. If you would have been in my place what would you have done? what would you have done? You are right Chandni, I gave you a lot of sorrows. I always thought, that you will come to me whenever I want. I never thought that you will... Chandni, I have lost you again! This time, forever. You are happy.. I am leaving. Tell me, what has happened? Someone else has entered her life. Someone else! Do you know who he is? No. Does he know about your love? I don't know. It is not that man's fault. He is interfering between the both of you. That's his fault. Anyway, now I feel suffocated in this city. I am returning to Delhi with the evening flight, friend. What are you saying? Won't you stay back for my marriage? I am getting married after 2 days, you have to take part. Please Lalit, try and understand. I won't listen to you. You will have to stay back. Come Chandni! Rohit, she is my fiancee Chandni! Chandni, he is my friend Rohit. Won't you greet each other? -Hello. -Hello. Take a seat. Chandni, I was asking Rohit to stay back for our marriage.. ..but he doesn't listen. Actually it isn't his fault. He is sad. The girl he loved, she is marrying someone else. But if he doesn't attend our marriage, I will feel bad. You ask him, he might listen to you. If you attend your friend's marriage, he will be happy. If you want, then I will surely take part. You still aren't ready. Come on, come on. It's my friend's marriage. I will come so adorned, the world will see. The way you are drinking, the world will surely look. I am not drinking, I am strengthening my heart. If we would have gotten married together then we would have had a blast. If not mine, let's have a blast in your marriage. -Rohit. -Yes. Sometimes I feel you want to say something but I can't understand it. Even I can't understand. Anyway, go the priest. Must be calling you. He must be saying, "where is the groom?". Go! Come quickly. Great friend, you punish me and don't even spare me some time. Rohit, you have become a laughing stock. A laughing stock. What happened? Everyone is waiting. -Come on, mother. -Come on. Rohit! No! Rohit! Rohit! Chandni! Brother Ramesh, please save my Rohit! Rohit! Rohit! Brother Ramesh, please save my Rohit! - What happened to Rohit? Rohit! Save him! Save my Rohit! Save my Rohit, Lalit! Save my Rohit! Save him! Brother, call the doctor! Open your eyes! Open your eyes! -Brother Ramesh, do something. -Yes. Go quickly! Rohit! No Rohit! Doctor sir, doctor sir is everything fine. Blood pressure and ECG is fine. It's just a mild concussion. Everything will be fine in 1-2 days. Don't worry. 'Lovers never die! They can never lose.' 'Someone else has come in her life.' 'You belong only to me, you can't belong to anyone else.' 'I too loved someone.' 'Chandni, I want to marry you.' 'But you don't know anything about me.' 'Rohit was your past, Lalit is your present.' 'I liked Chandni a lot.' 'Seeing her gave rise to some desires in my heart.' 'I gave birth to him, but you gave him life.' 'I will always be indebted to you.' 'The day Chandni comes as the daughter-in-law.. ..that will be an auspicious day. The vermillion in your forehead looks so good. Have you booked the suite? Yes, the honeymoon suite! Yes, thank you that's good! And listen, adorn the entire room with roses. And a champagne bucket. And listen, there shouldn't be anything lacking. After all, you get married only once in life. Yes, two first class tickets. I would prefer A row. What is the time of the flight? The flight is on time. Very good. Thank you! Thank you! Chandni! Till today, I never saw such a beautiful bride. Mother. Driver, take the car out. Shankar, keep the luggage in the car. Mother. Chandni, where are you? You are still not ready? -I am all ready. -Where is mother? Where can mother go, she is right here. Come on, quickly, it's time for the flight. Lalit sir. Where are you going leaving me behind? I am there too. You are always late. You take time to get ready like girls. Don't fire me, I will change this habit gradually. You are looking very nice. Thank you. Come on, hurry up. Driver! -Chandni, come. -Yes. Mother, you have showered a lot of love on me. Bless you, always be happy. Bye, mother. Come on. Mother, I am your other son. Don't forget me. Can a mother ever forget her child? You are my younger son. Go, be happy. Bye. Son. Why did you do that? Mother, it was a compromise and not love! And you can't live your life on compromises. Maybe you are not destined for the happiness of a daughter-in-law! And I am not destined for anyone's love. ♪ My heart is suffering again! ♪ It's the monsoon season again Chandni I am your Chandni Chandni Oh, my Chandni Chandni I am your Chandni Chandni Oh, my Chandni Chandni I am your Chandni
