Tell me, where on earth is she? The mistress never tells me when she goes out. Tell you? Where is she? I didn't see her going out last night. When I'm not home, has she ever spent the night out? No, she has never done that. Send people to look for her. Yes. Is it Miss Guo Fon-Jiao? Was Guo Jing-Min your elder brother? Yes, what happened? I'm sorry to tell you some bad news. We got a call from the Yaliu police. There was a boating accident. A man and a woman fell into the sea. We've found the man's body. It's likely to be Guo Jing-Min. Please come see it. What? My big brother? Yes, we found only the woman's handbag. But not her body. We hope Miss Guo can come to identify the body as soon as possible. OK. How could it be possible? He was going to Hong Kong today. I thought you'd been married for seven or eight years. My brother must have given up on Sui-Hun. How could I have guessed that they were still seeing each other? It was all my brother's fault. How am I going to face people? Look at what it's in the evening paper! Yi-Ming... Get out! Lan. Why didn't you go play outside? Yellow leaves fall in autumn as birds keep crying Birds' crying sounds so sad that tears well up in our eyes Missing the old time that is lost Birds' crying sounds so sad that loneliness hits our hearts The sun goes down before the cold winds blow The moon knows my sadness and I feel very uncomfortable Never think of the sadness in the past The moon knows my sadness but I still have to bear it My big sister knew I came back to Taiwan from Singapore. So she wrote to me, asking me to visit her. She wrote it before the accident. Could she have done such a shameful thing? We hadn't seen each other for fifteen years. I know nothing about her recent life events. But I heard she was a virtuous woman. She was very gentle, too. (To whom it may concern, we are hiring you as our governess...) (00:To: Miss Bei Sui-Mi) Miss, is this your letter? Yes, it's mine. Thank you. Miss, are you a teacher? Huh? I can tell fortune. Let me tell your fortune. I'm specialized in faces. It's just for your reference. I'll do it for free. You are welcome. Miss. Please be careful. From now on, you'll be in a completely new and different environment. That place is filled with horror and misery. Huh? There is a poor child and a man with a bad reputation. He's probably the child's father. In short, you have to be really careful. Or bad luck is sure to befall you. Thanks, I've no time for fortune-telling. Miss. Gin-Suan! Gin-Suan! She's back. What's up? What are you doing here in the early morning? What a shameless girl! I was young once, you know? Gin-Suan. What's that on your lips? Why didn't you go pick up Miss Bei? I was going to but she just clung on to me. What could I do? Wait. How are you going to recognize her without the photo? This photo... Mrs "Loud"... What did you call me? I mean "Lau", not "loud". Or shall I call you Madam Lau? Shall I call you that? The teacher looks so much like the mistress. They look like sisters. We did it deliberately. So Miss Su-Luan won't miss her mother. That's right. It's all due to your husband. Nonsense! What my husband?! That's not what I mean. I mean "efforts"! OK, OK. Off you go, quick! Excuse me, are you Miss Bei? Yes. Miss Bei, I've been waiting for you for ages! Please, this way. Teacher? I'm in junior high, not a teacher! I'm sorry. I'm sorry. Are you Miss Bei? Yes. Miss Bei, the teacher, right? -Yes. I've been waiting for you for ages. Please, this way. Please get into the car. Here we are! Please go up there. Miss Bei. Mrs Lau. Thank you for coming all the way. You're welcome. Please go up stairs. On the second floor I showed you just now was the mistress's room. You had better not go into it. This is your room. What are you staring at? This is? My granddaughter. Off you go! She's so cute. She's a bit daft. Please. Zuo-Di, clean the room thoroughly and make the bed. Ok. Mrs Lau, don't let me disrupt your work. When you settle down, please come to the drawing room on the second floor. Sure. Zuo-Di, why didn't I see Miss Wang? She goes out when her father isn't home. When she heard you were coming, she went to see Miss Guo next door. Su-Luan, I think you should go meet your new governess. Auntie Fon-Jiao, she works for us. Why should I go meet her? Uncle! Bro. Uncle, did you get me any present? Bro, why did you come back so late? I was so busy with my business that I forgot. I'll get you presents next time, alright? You never keep your word. I know. You were looking for pretty girls so you forgot it, right? Nonsense! Our maids told me... They said... Auntie told me about it too. They say my daddy is still seeing our neighbor, Mr Lian's wife Right? Oh, I forgot to tell you someone called and said that your daddy is coming back. Really? Su-Luan, wait! Su-Luan. He should be back soon. Sir. Please sit down. Miss Bei, this is my master. This is Miss Bei. Mr Wang. This is Mrs Lian. Miss Bei. Mrs Lau. -Yes? Where is Su-Luan? She's gone to next door. She should be back soon. Daddy! Daddy! You knew Miss Bei was coming. Why did you come back so late? Daddy. Go meet the governess. Miss Bei. Miss Bei. My name is Guo. You must be Miss Guo Fon-Jiao. Su-Luan, I checked your exercise book just now. You don't like arithmetic? Su-Luan, Miss Bei is asking you a question. You should answer it at once. Miss Bei, I need to go now. As for Su-Luan's education, I'll leave it completely to you. Cousin. Goodbye, everyone. Su-Luan, bye bye. Auntie! Stop crying... What a coincidence! Miss Bei, it's been just a few since you joined the family, why are you looking so pale? Who on earth are you? I'm Guo Fon-Jiao's brother. That's why you knew I was coming here. This place is haunted. It's getting dark. How do you dare to come here? Why is it haunted? The story is simple. The wife found her husband cheating on her, so she went out with her lover. But they were killed in a boating accident. Who was her lover? My elder brother. His body was found. But the wife's body was never found. So some say the wife is still alive. The wife is alive? So where is she now? It's a mystery. That's why this place is haunted. Miss Bei, are you scared? Let me walk you back. I'm not scared. Thanks. Tung, tell you what. What? You've got a new lover? You're so smart! You know who my new lover is? How would I know if you don't tell me? He lives in this house! This house? It's the master! Don't you think he's beyond your reach? You know nothing! The master treats me very differently now. Every time he sees me, he winks at me. You don't know how nice it feels! Stop dreaming. If you don't believe me... One day, you'll call me "my lady". You've lost your mind! My lady... My lady? No, I'm the new governess. New governess? Your name is... I'm the caretaker here... Tung. Tung? Oh, Uncle Tung. You've such good manners! Yellow leaves fall in autumn as birds keep crying Lan is singing. She sings in front of the shrine at dusk and scares everyone to death! Let me ask her to stop. Ghost! There is a ghost! What happened? Where is the ghost? It's in the mistress's room. Nonsense! It's true! Yes, there is a ghost! It's so strange. How can there be a ghost in broad daylight? Let's go have a look. No, I don't dare. I don't dare to go. Why not? We are all here with you. Go! -Let's have a look. Is there really a ghost? Why is the door open? Yeah, it's open. No, it was closed! Did you get it wrong? How could I get it wrong? I was walking past it just now. I had something in my hands. The door was left open. Then I heard the door...making a sound so I stopped. All of a sudden, there was a black shadow. A black shadow? And then? The door suddenly shut! I got so scared that I ran away at once. There is nothing! Come have a look! No? Nothing? Nothing. Come have a look. Nothing at all. You're talking nonsense! Yellow leaves fall in autumn One, two... First room, second room... Weird... Why is the light in my sis's room on? It's Miss Bei! Miss Bei! Miss Bei! -Miss Bei! Miss Bei! Miss Bei! The keyhole... ...there is an eye! There is an eye! Tung, go have a look inside. I don't dare... You're useless! Why is the door moving? Miss Bei, let's have a look inside. Yes, yes. Did someone touch the duvet? In that case, someone was sleeping in here. Did you come in? No, you asked me not to come into this room. How would I dare to come in? This... It's hair! Hair? It's still warm. I know... this... The mistress has come back and slept here! Sis... Who is it? It's me. Miss Bei, good morning. -Good morning. Please go have breakfast. Just leave it. I'll make the bed myself. It's OK. I'll do it. It's weird. It's been ages since the ghost appeared. Since when did this house become haunted? It's appeared twice since the mistress died. It wasn't a ghost last night. It was someone alive. How do you know? Because someone doesn't want me to be the governess. Someone tries to scare me away. I don't think so. There aren't many people in this house. Besides you're recommended by Mrs Lau's good friend. I'm sure everyone welcomes you. Who was sleeping in the bed? Maybe the mistress's spirit has come back! Su-Luan. What is 12 plus 7? What is 12 plus 7? What are you staring at? Go away! Su-Luan, don't be like this. You want to study? Come in. It's OK. Come on. Get out! Su-Luan, don't be like this. Isn't it better if you've got company? Your name is Su-Lan, right? Come on, it's alright. Come. Su-Luan, go do the arithmetic! It's alright to sit down. What is 12 plus 7? Have you got it? Your daddy gives you 12 dollars and your mommy gives you 7 dollars. How much do you have in total? Mommy... Mommy... Su-Luan, let's go for a walk. Lan, come join us. Lan, hurry up! Su-Luan, Su-Luan! Su-Luan, Su-Luan! Lan, you know where Su-Luan is running to? To the grave. You mean her mother's grave? Yes. Her mother is still alive. The mistress is still alive. Lan, you say the mistress is still alive? How would you know? Can you take me to the grave? Mommy, why did you leave me? Mommy. You can't love me anymore. And Daddy doesn't love me either. Mommy! Miss, over there! -Mommy. Mommy. Mommy. Su-Luan. Su-Luan. Su-Luan. Stop crying. Apart from teaching you, I'll try my best to love you like a mother, alright? I promise you I'll work something out to make your daddy love you as before. Good girl. Is it OK? Miss, you look very much like my mother. Really? Yellow leaves fall in autumn as birds keep crying Birds' crying sounds so sad that tear well up in our eyes Lan, who taught you this song? The mistress. What? My mommy? The mistress? Yes. The mistress. Bro. -Hmm? Have you seen Mrs Lian Chun-Ying recently? Doesn't she often hang around with Yi-Ming? Why she married someone fifteen years older than her, you can probably guess. One little, two little, three little Indians... She's known Yi-Ming for a long time, hasn't she? Who is it? Auntie Fon-Jiao! Sui-Hun was still alive so they couldn't see each other. That's right. She married Lian for his money, right? Bro, Su-Luan is there. Hi! Miss Bei. -Miss Guo. Here you are. Auntie. Uncle. Uncle, are you taking me to play golf? Yes, and I'll teach you to play it. Really? Miss, I'm going with Uncle. We'll start the Chinese lesson in half an hour. Come back soon. OK. Uncle, let's go. OK. Miss Bei, you must feel a bit strange? Actually, Mrs Wang and I were classmates in junior high. Moreover, Yi-Ming is my cousin. That's why I care so much about Su-Luan. I know. You're very welcome to visit us. Thank you, but I need to go back now. Then let me walk you home. It's OK. Lan? Lan? She's probably gone back. Let's go. Daddy. Look! Isn't my handwriting beautiful? Daddy. You should be studying. Why did you leave the desk? Su-Luan, stop crying. Good girl. Let's get back to study. Mr Wang, could you spare me a few minutes? What for? I'd like to discuss something with you. Come to the drawing room. Su-Luan, I'll be back in a minute. OK. Miss Bei, what do you want to discuss with me? It's about Su-Luan. Su-Luan? Mr Wang, in a child's education a parent's love is needed. Why are you so cold to your daughter? Now Su-Luan has lost her mother. You should love her even more. I get angry at the sight of Su-Luan. Is she your daughter? Of course, she is! Then you've no reason to be angry at your own daughter. When I see her, I think of her mother. So I can't... Mr Wang, you're an educated gentleman. Even if the parent is guilty, the child is innocent. You're behaving worse than an uneducated man. Shut up! I'm your employer. You've no right to mind my family's business. Since you entrust your child to me I certainly have the right to ask for your cooperation. If you're not willing to cooperate, hire someone else! Miss Bei. I'm sorry for what I said. Please forget it. Would you please work with me again? I'm willing to accept your opinion. Thank you very much, Mr Wang. I'll spend as much time as possible with Su-Luan. Uncle! Miss, uncle is here. Mr Guo. Su-Luan, I haven't seen you for a month and you've grown so much! Look what it is! Is it for me? I keep my word this time, right? Zuo-Di, take it in. Yes. Uncle, thank you. I'm off to play golf. Goodbye, Miss Bei. Miss, can you play golf? Yeah. I haven't played golf for a year. My mommy loved playing golf. Miss, please come play it. I have no golf clubs or clothes. There are golf clubs in my mommy's room. I'll show you. Lan, wait for us. Come in, it's alright. Miss, come in. It's alright. Miss, this is what my mommy wore when she played golf. April 30th. April 29th. Write to Sui-Mi. April 28th. May 1st. Weird. She took the brooch back from the jeweller's on April 30th and planned to go to Mrs Tsai's party. And she was on the boat trip in Yaliu that morning? How could it be possible? Weird... How could it be possible? Mommy... Miss, you look so much like my mommy. Do I? Yes. Su-Luan, let's go play golf. Yes. Daddy! Mr Wang. You finished your homework? Yeah. Mr Wang, I'm wearing Mrs Wang's clothes... It's fine. You look very much like my wife. I've seen the photos of Mrs Wang. I don't think so. Miss Bei. You look different and very nice when you dress like this. Mr Wang, you must be joking. Su-Luan, let's go. Yes. Daddy, bye bye! -Bye. Cousin. Su-Luan and Miss Bei are off to play golf together. Miss Bei is a very hard-working teacher. I feel relieved. Right. I'm having a party tomorrow. Come help me with it. Is the party held for Mrs Lian? No. Cousin, Mrs Lian is a married woman. Everyone in town knows about you two. I'm really worried about you. Fon-Jiao, thanks for your concern. I shall leave the party to you. Miss Bei, shall we dance? I can't dance. I can tell you're a very good dancer. Please. Miss Bei is here! Let's go over there. Miss Bei, why are you so cold? Come on, let's go. Let's watch them from there. Let's go! Let's go over there. You see better from there. Come on. Come, let's go over there. Come on! No. If you don't, I'll go on my own! Yo-Kun, look after the guests for me. May I dance with you? I can't really dance. Don't worry. Ga-Mun. Ga-Mun. Are you sleepy? I'm taking a break. Then I'll feel better. I want to go home. It's still early. If you don't want to go, I'll leave by myself. Fine, fine. Say goodbye to the host. No need! Drive Mr and Mrs Lian home. Yes. Take care. Good night. Is Yi-Ming a womanizer? If I don't leave this place, something is bound to happen. But if I leave, I'll never find out what really happened to my sister. What should I do? Come in. Mr Wang, what is the matter? Please sit down. I've already packed up. Please sit down. Miss Bei. I know my behavior last night was very inappropriate. I was being so impulsive that I couldn't control myself. I apologize to you sincerely. Please, for my child's future... Please stay, alright? Hello, this is Yi-Ming. Chun-Ying, what did you say? What happened to Mr Lian? You don't know when he passed away? OK, I'll be there right away. Miss Bei, Mr Lian has died. I need to rush over and see what happened. Please forgive me for what I did last night. Cousin. Cousin, I've got some news. What is it? I'm rushing to the Lians'. Cousin, Mr Lian died this morning. I got a phone call. Cousin, what I'm telling you has something to do with Mr Lian too. Mr Lian? He was poisoned. How did you know? The police told me so. You had better stop seeing Chun-Ying. It'll work against you. I understand your advice. Cousin, come back as soon as possible. So you won't cause any misunderstanding. Zuo-Di, Zuo-Di. Why am I lying here? Come on, get up! What happened to you? I walked past the mistress's room. I don't know who hit me. I just passed out. Before you came into this room, did you see anyone? No. I was talking to Ai downstairs. Then when Mrs Lau called Ai away, I came upstairs. What were you and Ai talking about? Well... well... I said the next-door neighbors aren't decent folk. I was saying... saying... It's alright to tell me. I'll keep it secret for you. I said Miss Fon-Jiao is so shameless. She thought she was Mrs Wang! What do you mean? Nothing... Are you alright? I'm alright... I've got work to do. I should go now. Wait! Excuse me. Can I have a look of the brooch? Mrs Wang, I haven't seen you for ages! I'm the governess. I want to buy the brooch as a present for Miss Wang. You look so much like Mrs Wang. I can't believe Mrs Wang would die. What do you mean? The day before she died she brought the brooch Mrs Tsai gave her here for repair. She said she was going to Mrs Tsai's party. Why did she have to wear that brooch? She said if she didn't wear the brooch, she would offend the hostess. She was worried I wouldn't get it ready so she came a day early. So she was definitely going to the party. How could she die in a boating accident? It sounds so incredible. Please wrap it up. This one, right? Yes, this one. Thank you. This is a brooch for you. Are you happy? Thank you, miss. Lan! Lan! Lan! Miss Bei gave me this brooch! Lan, when we get home, I've got a present for you too. Thank you, miss. Su-Luan. Wait! Ghost! Sui-Hun! Miss Guo. Miss Guo, it's me! Miss Bei. Why did you come here? I was looking for my brother. The door was open so I came in. Miss Bei, we haven't seen each other for a week. Yes? I wonder what you think of the thing I mentioned to you a few days ago. You mean the marriage proposal? Yes. Mr Guo, I'm just a governess. I'm not good enough for you. I'm sorry. She's a cold-blooded animal. It's because you're not clever enough! Huh? Sui-Mi. Sui-Mi. Sui-Mi! Don't leave this family. If you do, Su-Luan will be left on her own. No one will look after her. Please, I'm begging you. Sis, were you murdered? Did you fall into the sea? Or were you killed at home? Sis, please tell me. Where were you killed? Please tell me! Sis! Sis! Sis! Sis! Sis! Sis! Why is the light in my sister's room on? Who is it? Who is hiding behind the curtains? Come out, now! Lan. It's you! Lan, you nearly scared me to death. Why were you hiding behind the curtains? I thought it was my granny. She'll beat me. Why will she beat you? No one is allowed in the mistress's room. You often came in here before? Lan, was that you who looked through the keyhole? What do you want to do in this room? I'm waiting for the mistress to come back. She always asks me to come here at night. The mistress? The mistress is still alive I'm waiting for her to come back. Why do you keep saying the mistress is still alive? On the morning of the day she went missing, she brushed my hair and dressed me in pretty clothes. She said she was taking me out. Yi-Ming. I couldn't say it just now as we were surrounded by people. Do you believe that I would kill Ga-Mun? I've been framed. Please believe me. I think someone tries to frame us. Of course, I believe you wouldn't do it. Chun-Ying, does anyone bear grudge against you? No! The police are investigating. I'm sure the truth will come to light soon. Then you'll be cleared of the blame. They want to question me at ten. You'll be questioned too, right? Yes, at one. I should head to the police station now. Mr Guo, please show some respect. I want to see if you're truly cold-blooded. Turns out... ... yes, you are. I don't want to be in any relationship. Su-Luan! Lan! Lan! Hello. This is Mrs Lau. Who is it? Badao? Sir? Ask Miss Bei to take Miss Su-Luan to Badao? Yes. I'll tell her. Come in. Miss Bei, Mr Wang called from Badao. He asked you to take Miss Su-Luan to him. Asked me? I'll ask the driver to take you to the station this afternoon. Miss, I'm so happy. I'm going to tell Auntie Fon-Jiao about it. Lan. I'm going to Badao. Be a good girl at home, alright? Miss, don't go. Why not? Miss, you won't come back if you go. I'll definitely come back. No, no, no! No. No, no, no! Lan, don't cry. Or shall I take you with me? I'll ask your granny about it. Birds are welcoming the spring They jump back and forth Keeping you and me company We're so happy as we sing along Spring breezes smell as sweet as honey Flowers blossom as the breeze blows Birds are welcoming the spring They jump back and forth Keeping you and me company We're so happy as we sing along Welcome! Mr Wang, I wonder if Lan is welcomed here. Yes, she is very welcomed. Miss, I can ride a bike! Be careful. Lan, shall I teach you to ride a bike? Your granny said you were knocked over by a bike once. Mrs Wang knocked you over. Luckily you were there or she would have hit the stone and died. Pity that you saved her life once but she lived for only four more years. The mistress is still alive. The mistress is still alive? The mistress is still alive? Daddy, let go of it! I can ride on my own. Daddy, my leg! Daddy! My leg! Get the doctor! -I'll go get the doctor! Doctor, is it serious? Mr Wang, it's nothing serious as long as the fever is gone. Miss. Miss. Miss. Su-Luan. Miss, please don't go. I'm so scared. Miss. -Su-Luan, Su-Luan. Don't be scared. Miss. Don't be scared. I'm here. Miss, please don't go. I'm so scared. Were you dreaming? Don't be scared. I'm here. Miss, you can't leave. Can you be my mommy? Su-Luan, I'll definitely keep you company. Have some milk and go back to sleep, OK? Miss, I wanted you to be my mommy. And you said nothing. You just asked me to have milk. Su-Luan, we'll talk when you get well, OK? No, no! OK, I agree to be your mommy. But we have to keep it secret. You can call me "Mommy" but only when no one is around, OK? Then can I call you now? Yeah. Really? Miss... Mommy, I want some milk. Let's go and see the beautiful scenery in the spring Now we feel it's such a wonderful life You're happy and so am I In the lovely spring I'm happy and so are you Let's go and see the beautiful scenery along the road Let's go out together Let's welcome the gentle breeze We've forgotten all the sadness You're happy and so am I In the lovely spring I'm happy and so are you We'll never be parted from each other We secretly hope we'll never be parted Miss Bei, do you remember something you said? On the night that Su-Luan got hurt, you told her that you would never leave. I said it just to comfort her. It doesn't matter. I think you were sincere. Su-Luan and I now have a happy family because of you. If you leave us, we'll lose the happiness. I hope you can always make us a happy family. How can it be possible? I'm just an ordinary governess. Please don't turn it down. For the future of the children, and the Wang family, I'm proposing to you. Yes. I'm so happy. When we go back to Taichung the day after tomorrow, we'll announce our engagement at once. Di, why are you crying? Tung, put yourself in my shoes for a second. In the past six months, I spent all my wages on makeup and clothes. I've invested so much in it. But my hope is shattered! What hope? The man I love has been taken away from me! You mean the master? Yes. He's getting married to Miss Bei! Didn't I tell you to stop dreaming? Go to hell! I'm so miserable and you're still making fun of me! I hear the car. The master is back. Come greet Miss Bei. I don't want to greet her. Sir, many congratulations! -Congratulations! Miss Bei. Mrs Lau. -My lady, congratulations! Someone is trying to kill me. Su-Luan, run, quick! Uncle Tung. -Miss Bei. Lan. Lan, come. Show me Miss Chan's room, alright? Yes. This is her room. Isn't it the shrine? How can I see the shrine from here? Right, I'm going to see Miss Chan. Miss Bei, please have tea. Miss Chan, sorry to brother you. I was forced to leave the Wang family. Mr Wang was very nice to me so Mrs Lian didn't like me at all. One day Mrs Lian came to the house. When she was waiting for Mr Wang, she left her handbag on the piano before going to the bathroom. Then Miss Guo said she wanted to see Su-Luan. Later I left the drawing room as well. I didn't know what happened. When Mrs Lian came out of the bathroom, she couldn't find the purse in her handbag. She gathered and questioned all of us. We all said we didn't see it. Mrs Lian seemed very suspicious of me. She asked everyone to look for it separately. When Mrs Lau and Miss Guo searched my room, it was so strange that the purse was found in my suitcase. So everyone thought I stole it. Mrs Lau wanted to call the police but Miss Guo begged her on my behalf. So I left the Wang family without trouble. She even helped me find a new job. Did Miss Guo ever contact you later? No. Please thank Miss Guo on my behalf. Right, Miss Guo seems very interested in the Wang mansion. Recently, I saw a mansion similar to the Wang's in Logang. There was a secret chamber in the shrine. So I believe these is also a secret chamber in the shrine at the Wangs'. Please ask her to check in the shrine. Yes, I'll tell her. I would like to thank you for telling me things about the Wangs. I'm very happy to make friends with you. Me too. I'll become Su-Luan's mother the day after tomorrow. Many congratulations! Miss Chan, I hope you can come to my wedding. I'll definitely be there. Goodbye. -Goodbye. Thank you. Miss Bei, my brother is going to Taipei tonight and fly to Hong Kong tomorrow morning. He wants to say goodbye to you. What a coincidence! Yi-Ming went to Taichung to invite the chair of local council. I'm sorry that he can't see you off. Miss Bei, I wish you all the happiness. Thank you. Uncle, let me show you something. Right, I met Miss Chan. She's engaged as well. She's very grateful to you. She wanted to thank you. Don't mention it! I couldn't let her be bullied by that woman. Miss Guo, it's so kind of you to protect the vulnerable. Right, Miss Chan told me about the secret chamber. The secret chamber? Does she know where it is? The secret chamber is likely to be in the shrine. She said she would want me to go with her when she investigated it. She said you could come with us. What do you think? Would you like to join us? Yes. I'll think about it when I get home. Bro. It's getting late. Let's go home! Yes. Goodbye. -Mrs Lau, see the guests out. Miss Bei, if you want to marry me, it won't be too late till ten this evening. Many thanks for your sincerity. Let me think about it, OK? Although I can't be there, my sister will definitely come on our behalf. Tung, we're going back. So soon? Mr and Miss Guo, you must come to the wedding tomorrow. Yes. -Yes. Miss Guo, here you are again! Why the flashlight? It was very dark outside. I saw my brother off at the station just now. I felt so lonely when I got home. I thought I could keep you company and help you get ready for the wedding tomorrow. Thank you so much. Mr Wang isn't home. Su-Luan is in bed. It's so good that you keep me company. Come sit down. Right. Yesterday you told me that there was a secret chamber in this house. I've already found out about it. So what Miss Chan said was true? When I come back from my honeymoon, I'll ask her to go together. No! It'll be ages when you come back. There must be some treasure hidden in it. It's not good if other people find out about it. You're getting married tomorrow. We had better go have a look tonight. If there is any treasure, it'll be the best dowry you can give to my cousin. OK, let's go. It's so dark. Come on. It's here. Hold it. So strange... Didn't I tell you about it? Let's get in, quick. Get in, quick! Or someone may see us. Who is it? -Who is it? Shh! -Who is it? You wait here. I'll go have a look. Stay here. Fon-Jiao, open the door. Fon-Jiao! Fon-Jiao! Miss! Miss! Miss! Miss! Sui-Mi! Sui-Mi! Fon-Jiao. I owe you nothing. Why are you being so cruel to me? Why do you want to kill me? Who is it? (Sui-Hun.) Su-Luan! Su-Luan, get up! Su-Luan! Su-Luan! Su-Luan, Su-Luan, get up! Daddy! Su-Luan! Su-Luan, did Miss Bei tell you where she was going? No. It's so strange. Could Fon-Jiao ask her out? They didn't come back after they left. Yeah, I saw them leave too. Go find her, quick! Hurry up! Miss! Miss Bei! Miss! Miss Bei! Miss Bei! Mommy! Sui-Mi! Mommy! Miss Bei! Miss! Miss! Miss Bei! Miss Bei! Sui-Mi! Miss Bei! Miss! Miss Bei! -Sui-Mi! Miss Bei! Sui-Mi! Miss Bei! -Miss! Lan! Sir, Lan is here! Lan is here! Quick! Lan is here! Come on, quick! Quick! Lan is here! Really? Quick! Lan, what are you doing in here? There, there, there! Lan! What are you doing? Miss Bei is in there. Really? Fon-Jiao took Miss Bei here and she left. In there? Where? Why is she trying to move the incense burner? It's open! How could there be a path? Sui-Mi! Miss Bei Miss... Mommy! -Sui-Mi! Sui-Mi! -Miss Bei! Sui-Mi! -Mommy! Sui-Mi! -Miss Bei! Sui-Mi, it's me! Sui-Mi! Sui-Mi! Mommy, it's me! Su-Luan. Mommy. -Miss... It's me, Yi-Ming! Sui-Mi! Sui-Mi! Sui-Mi! -Mommy! Miss Bei! Sui-Mi! Mommy. -Miss. Miss. Yi-Ming... Su-Luan... Mommy. Lan. -Miss. I'll call the doctor and police. Quick! It was Fon-Jiao who tried to kill you? -Yes. She tried to kill me. And she killed my sister! Over there. What? Your sister? Yes. That's right. Sui-Hun was my big sister. I came all the way to investigate her death. Sui-Hun. I wronged you! I'm sorry. Look, something is written on the wall. There! Over there! Fon-Jiao is a cruel heartless woman. I was lured into the basement. 5.40 pm April 30th. Sui-Hun. Right. I've got a plan for tomorrow. Fine, please, please take a seat. Grab him a seat. Sir, this guest wants to speak to you. Mr Huang! I haven't seen you for ages! Mr Wang, congratulations! Miss Guo, we're all waiting for you! This way, please. Please, this way... Cousin. Congratulations! What for? Sui-Mi disappeared last night and I can't find her! Really? Oh, I know. She must have fallen for my brother and run way with him to Hong Kong. Cousin, love between men and women is really unpredictable. You can never expect it, right? When all the guests arrive later, what am I to do without the bride? So where is the bride? The bride... You're the bride! Me? Cousin, I've been waiting for this for years! Mrs Lau, bring the wedding dress over. Please. You?! You?! Where are you running to? My kind Miss Fon-Jiao, I'm the bride who has returned from Hell. She's Sui-Hun's sister, Sui-Mi. She had been living abroad and took her uncle's surname. So you made a mistake. She came to Taiwan to investigate her sister's disappearance. You took the wrong step this time. Lan saw you drop the poison into the glass. You probably never thought you would pay for your sin one day. You tried to stop me from investigating the secret chamber. So you stole Mrs Lian's purse and planted it in my room. That's why you bailed me out and gave me money. And even helped me find a new job. Turns out you're a hypocrite. Unbelievable. Cousin, the reason why I did all these is because I love you. You can't get true love by manipulation. Come! You killed my mommy! Give me my mommy back! Give me my mommy back! I'm not afraid of you! Su-Luan. Su-Luan, don't be like this! Don't be like this. The police will seek justice for your mommy. I... I'll love you like your mommy. I'm sorry to shock you all. I'm sorry. Mrs Lau. Get it ready for the wedding. Let the wedding begin! Good! Bravo! After everything is resolved We can live in peace A merry married couple Are full of joy So young and beautiful Are the two of us We feel the gentle breeze along the way Can a dream of warmth and youth Be too good to be true? We are carefree We'll live happily ever after Smiling and laughing So young and beautiful Are the two of us The scenery is breathtaking Sparking joy in our hearts (The End)
