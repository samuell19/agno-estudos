Every soul will taste death. You will only receive your full reward on the Day of Judgment. Those spared from the Fire are admitted into Paradise, whereas the life of this world is no more than the delusion of enjoyment. Allah never delays a soul when its appointed time comes… You dishonored the family. You fell asleep. Okay. Turn a little to the left. Tilt your chin up. Okay. One, two, three. Ms. Zahara Anggi. I have her picture now. ID card? We don't recognize the refugee card. Do you have a red ID? Stone Turtle Island? I didn't know people lived there. Who is the child? My niece. Where is the mother? She's passed on. Non-citizens can't register for school. But I heard anyone can apply to local schools now. That's only in Kuala Lumpur. We don't have enough classes here for refugees. She's already ten and she hasn't been to school. Please help us. Can you wait? Mrs. Nora! They told me yesterday that I could present my case to the officer. She needs to go to school… You need the ministry's approval. So there's no point talking to the officer. Her father's a citizen. Why isn't he here? He needs to be present. There's a man here. The boatman refused to bring the boat to shore. Are you an immigration inspector? No. Police? I'm from Universiti Sains. Samad. What brings you to this island? I'm on a research trip. To find leatherback turtles. There are no leatherback turtles here. You see these tomato jellyfish? Leatherbacks love eating them. Tomato jellyfish have fine tentacles. Like a lion's mane. I know what they are. Do you mind if I spend the day looking around? Do as you wish. The island doesn't belong to us. What are you reading? It's about a Muslim girl who gets a superpower after inhaling some chemical gas. What type of superpowers? She can stretch her arms, legs, and body. She can also change sizes. Like an elastic band? Yes. But her parents are super strict. She's always getting grounded… Nika! What did the man talk to you about? About the comic. What comic? I found it at the town registry. You'll have to read schoolbooks soon. I don't want to go to school. Why not? You can't just be reading useless comics. They're not useless. They taught me many things. Like what? Like if we get attacked by poisonous chemical gases, we can dig an underground bunker and use plants to filter the gas. The comic taught you that? Also, if someone offers you a free purple smoothie, it might be spiked with a nano-virus that can control your brain. So no purple smoothie then. Yup. Nika, go get your pencil case. I got you a new pen. I need a sharpener. I'll get you one soon. Where are all the men? They've gone out to the sea. They return every few weeks. This is the common green turtle. It's not what I'm looking for. Dead carcasses do get washed up every now and then. Do you know this place? I can give you directions. I need someone to guide me around. I'll pay you. There are no men here, are there? I guess you were just being cautious. How many of you live here? Eight of us, including the children. The little girl, is she your…? My niece. Her mother? She's passed on. Does she go to school? She's not allowed to. And how do you make ends meet? We sell fish. Have we met before? I read this island is shaped like a giant turtle. I was told it was shaped like a sleeping pregnant woman. Same island, different myths. You don't miss it? Civilization? Watching movies? Listening to music? I can watch a movie if I want to. Your first location is over there. Ariff… Ariff! Ariff! Ariff! Ariff! Leatherbacks used to come here to lay eggs. But not anymore. You should update your notes. They're outdated. How long have you been here? Too long for me to remember… Are your parents still on the mainland? No. They've returned to our maker. They were from Aceh. We came to this country when I was ten. I thought you were researching turtles, not me. Well, you said you haven't seen any leatherback turtles. We share this island with ghosts, and not much else. My phone died. Just stay put. I need a bit more time. Wait for my orders. Hey, kid. Do you have rice? What happens in that comic? She meets a handsome Muslim boy. He has superpowers too. They fall in love. So they live happily ever after? No. He turns out to be evil. He betrays her. Ah. Classic. Do you know this story? A pair of turtles lived together in the ocean. One day, a storm came. The ocean turned violent. The male turtle ended up on a strange island. As he wandered about, a hermit crab came along and told him of a magical pool nearby. The pool was said to be filled with jellyfish, kelp, and all kinds of fish. But the hermit crab warned him that he must not touch anything in the pool. The male turtle went to the magical pool. He remembered the words of the hermit crab. But he couldn't resist. As he returned to the beach, the turtle slowly turned to stone. His legs, his shell, and, finally, his head all turned to stone. Thank you for participating in the ritual. A prince lusted over by seven sirens? Our version isn't quite the same. Wait. I know you're not a fisher. You steal and sell turtle eggs. I have no intention of interfering with what you do. I just want to finish my research. Okay? They come during the night and lay their eggs here when the tide goes out. Where are the eggs? They were traded this morning. What do you get for them? For the green and brown turtle eggs, RM 4 each. For the leatherbacks, RM 2500. Are you upset that we are killing the very thing you're trying to save? I'm not upset about that. My brother, Ariff… He came here a few days ago. I want to know what you did to him! Your brother was screaming your name when we cut out his tongue. He's joined the rest of the ghosts here. Ariff! I told you not to come here! Why didn't you listen to me?! Ariff! Overwhelmed with sorrow for his dead brother, the man was not aware that the sea urchin was poisonous. Its toxins had traveled to his heart. The boatman told you we kill uninvited guests, didn't he? You fell asleep. Okay. Turn a little to your left. Tilt up. Okay. One, two… Three. Okay, thank you. Your documents? Documents… I left my documents… What are you here for then? Miss, don't waste my time if you don't have the forms. Mrs. Nora! Mrs. Nora! There's a man here. I'm from the Science University. Samad. Is this your first time here? These are tomato jellyfish. They're the leatherbacks' favorite food. They have tentacles like a lion's mane. I'd like to look around here if you don't mind. What are you reading? Ms. Marvel and Loki. Is Loki a good or bad guy? He's both. And he's funny. Tell me, what day is it today? Tuesday. And what did we do yesterday? We went to the registry in town but they said we needed a picture. But the shop was closed. You didn't see that man yesterday? I got you something. For your schoolwork. I don't want to go to school. Why not? You've never been. Maybe you'll like it. I won't like it. Well, you can't read comics all day. You can learn a lot from comics, actually. Like how purple smoothies are spiked with mind-controlling nano-viruses? And you shouldn't trust people just because they are nice. Nika, bring your pencil case. I still need a sharpener. I'll get it later. Today, I want you to play in here. No wandering around. Do you know this place? The man again offered money for the woman's services. Not knowing what else to do, she accepted. You remind me of my first love, Mariana. Last night, I dreamt I was holding her in my arms. Just like now. What did the boatman say to you when he refused to bring you to our island? He said you were a bunch of savages. He's not wrong. Why live here? You can find work easier on the mainland. And be treated like a ghost? I'd rather be alive on an island of ghosts than be a ghost in the land of living. I know what you do here. I know you poach turtle eggs and sell them. So you've come to take away my livelihood? No. My phone died. Just stay put. Don't do anything until I tell you to. Do you have rice? Do you know this story? The turtle slowly turned to stone. His legs, his shell, and, finally, his head all turned to stone. When he looked into the girl's eyes, the man felt he was looking at a reflection of himself. Are you really a turtle scientist? Come with me. Can you help them? I tried to feed them insects but they didn't want to eat. We've to protect the other eggs from predators. I took one of your books. I hope you don't mind. The story is supposed to end with the turtle turning to stone. But you wrote an addendum. May I read it? The female turtle wept when she saw her mate turned to stone. Her tears flowed into the ocean and created a storm. She met the hermit crab who told her that in order to break the male turtle's curse, she had to find a special flower that grew atop the tallest mountain. This flower bloomed only during the full moon eclipse. As years went by, the female searched for the flower. But to no avail. I think her quest is… romantic. You find it romantic? A love story with a poet's ending. A poet's ending is always tragic. Your brother came here a few days ago with the intention of muscling in on our business. My brother… Did you kill him? His fate was kinder than my sister's. Your sister? Tell me, why pose as a turtle researcher? I don't care what he told you. He's not a good person. My sister died because of you. Your brother died because of you too. I don't know you. I don't know your sister! I was much younger the first time we met. You don't recognize her? I don't! I don't! Nika? Nika! Nika! Nika! Nika! Nika! Nika! Nika! Nika! Every soul will taste death. You will receive your full reward on the Day of Judgment. Those spared from the Fire are admitted into Paradise, whereas the life of this world is no more than the delusion of enjoyment. Allah never delays a soul when its appointed time comes. The little girl had been born out of wedlock. When she turned seven, her grandparents decided to reclaim the family's honor. The woman took the little girl to an island, one that she had heard stories about as a child. At first, they ate the turtle eggs. But the woman soon discovered a black market for them. Of course he wants to eat first. - Of course. - We can't trust him. She knew word of her enterprise would travel to the man, like ants to a discarded candy bar. But it was the man's younger brother who came instead. I had a dream I fell in the ocean and drowned. Her father's a citizen? Where is he? He needs to be present. He's just passed away. Have you filed for a death certificate? Not yet. Fill out this form… and bring his identity card. I'll be back soon. Promise me you won't go anywhere. Where's Nika? I changed the plan. This ritual is used to ward off evil sea spirits and to ensure safe passage through the seas. But it can also be used to curse someone. For some, a curse is worse than death. Ariff! Ariff! Ariff! Ariff. Ariff! My brother didn't deserve to die! Neither did my sister. I was 15. My sister and I used to work at the market. One night, after closing time, you waited for me. You were drunk, so I doubt you remember me. But I remember everything. Your smell, like charcoal. It makes me want to gag even now. I was too young to be a mother. My sister took my sin and claimed my child as her own. She paid for what happened to me… …with her own life! I swore one day I would avenge her. An eye for an eye. Your brother and you for my sister! My brother won't be alone in hell, bitch! My men had their way with her. She's your daughter! Nika! Nika. Nika. I… I remember you. At the market, at night… Your sister had to make a delivery… so I offered to drive you home. You accepted. You fell asleep in the car. Your hair was covering your face. When I parted your hair… I saw my first love, Mariana. I swear I thought you were her. I didn't plan it. I didn't mean to do anything to you. I'm… sorr... My daughter… Can I read it to you? The female turtle searched for the flower. But each time she reached the mountaintop, the flower had wilted and the eclipse had ended. Years went by. The turtle was old now. She was now blind in one eye. She climbed the mountain. This time, the flower was there. She took it. She brought the flower to the male turtle. At that moment, the turtle realized she couldn't remember why she had spent her whole life on this quest. The male turtle returned to life. But the female turtle was gone. The male turtle looked for her. He returned to the ocean and spent an eternity searching for her. Nika. Nika! Nika! Nika! Nika! Her daughter was gone. Yes! You drink. I don't want to. My husband was such a shithead. When we were having sex, he would stop halfway, take out a measuring tape, and ask me to measure his cock. He would get angry if I lied. But he was never satisfied with his size. 12 cm, 13 cm, 14 cm… It was never long enough. He said if he hit optimum conditions, he could be 17 or 18 cm long. I told him even Black men aren't so big! But he wouldn't listen. He blamed me for not "exciting" him. So I had a fake ruler made. On this ruler, his dick was 19 cm long! He was very happy. Finally, he had achieved his dream. What about my dreams? I wanted to be a dancer when I was young. Did he care? No. So I left him. I packed my bags and told him I was leaving. He was so angry he tried to strangle me. Look, you can still see the marks. Mia! Where's your boat?
