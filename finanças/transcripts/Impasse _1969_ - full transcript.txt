Pear Blossom! Pear Blossom! - Telegram. - Thank you. Who this Maria Bonita? Girl I knew in the Philippines. - In the Pacific? War with the Japs? - Maria Bonita! Filipina. Body like a serpent. Body like a serpent. Twenty-five years ago, maybe body like a serpent, Now body like a buffalo, I bet. Uh-uh, she was awful young. Maybe still awful good. You gonna go this place? Phill-i-peens? You row, I fish. I asked you a question! - Yes or no? - Maybe. Body like a serpent, huh? Dirty old Indian, Dirty old Apache wino! I'll give you a body you'll never forget! Take it easy, take it easy. Did you bring anything? - All it was safe to. - Let's see them, come on, come on, come on. Perfects! Perfects! Mariko, I told you not to take anything unusual. Anything that might be missed. Oh, that's okay. Daddy doesn't even know about it... I'm not worried about your daddy, I'm worried about your husband. - I'm almost sure... - Almost is not good enough! Well, if you don't want to sell it, take it back to Manila with you, have it set for me. - Nobody will ever know. - I don't know, baby. This thing must be worth a lot of money. This deal's costing me plenty. 3600 to PMZ. 3600 to PMZ. PMZ to 3600. Is that you, Charley? Yeah, Pat. That deal went through just the way you wanted it. Good work, Charley. Over and out. Well, that's, uh, 2,000 more in the Kitty. Is everything you do illegal? No, honey. Not everything. Oh, I forgot, I think it's Jesus. It's all right, just stay where you are. She certainly doesn't fit into the groove of the Japanese wife. - Obedient. Willing. - Please shut up about Mariko. All right. How about a drink? - Thanks, coke. - No, I mean a drink. Coca-Cola is a drink. You know, with a name like Jesus Jimenez Riley, I think you'd want something a little stronger than Coca-Cola. Don't let the Irish name fool you. I'm Muslim, just like my mother. No liquor in this life. My jollies come later. You mean like in heaven, huh? Well, I'll take mine now. What's on your mind? That guy you sent for, from Arizona. He's down at Hotel La Perla. You mean Draco? Draco the, uh... The Apache? You can say that again. He took over the bar and drove everyone out. I'll go down later and quiet him down. Be sure he don't cool you, man. He's like a bull. - You remember him from Corregidor? - Sort of. That was 25 years ago. What about Karl Hansen, do you remember him? Hansen, yeah, I remember him. You had to be white, Protestant, Anglo Saxon, or Scandinavian, or you were dirt! Dirt! Yeah, I remember him. I get Hansen, I'll have the complete 1942 crew. Where is that slob? Last I heard about him, he was the third mate on the SS Vizaya Queen. That old rust bucket was on the reef of Mindoro for a while. Too bad he wasn't shot. Don't talk like that. I need him. I sure hate to do business with someone I hate! That Hansen. You shouldn't hate so much, Jesus. It's bad for your glands. When I hate, man, there's no Sundays and holidays. Listen, on your way back to town, why don't you stop by La Perla for me and see if you can cool that Indian off? I don't want the cops to take him in. I'm not going back to town, I'm going to see the roosters fight. See you. Vizaya Queen to PMZ. Vizaya Queen to PMZ. Hansen. Vizaya Queen to PMZ. Vizaya Queen to PMZ. Mariko. - Mariko, come in here! - Just a minute. Vizaya Queen to PMZ. - Do you understand Chinese? - No. Yeah, well, ask him if anybody there speaks Japanese. It's a ship, the SS Vizaya Queen. Go on, speak. Ask him if he knows where Karl Hansen is. What did he say? He said Karl Hansen is in jail here in Zamboanga. Jail? - Uh, thank him. - You thank him. It's your message. Just arigato is enough. Well? Come on, unfinished business. - Do you think he came back? - I don't know. - All right! All right! - All right! - Yeah? - You Pat Morrison? - You must be Draco, huh? - Where is she? - Look, why don't you get a little sleep? - Where is she? Hey, can't we talk about this later, huh? You know, I can't figure you out. I don't know you and you send me plane fare to come see Maria Bonita. So, maybe you have a reason. Great. Me, I don't give a damn. Where is Maria? Look, why don't you go home and get a good night's rest... - Are you hiding her? - No, I'm not hiding her. Look, why don't we talk about it tomorrow? I don't want to talk about it now, huh? Now! - You all right? - Yeah. Come on. For a moment I thought I'd had it. Oh, boy. Hey, what the hell did you give me last night, huh? Three Seconals. Seconals? Chihuahua! No wonder I slept like I was dead. I still hum like a big alarm clock bong in here. All right, let's have the rest. You cooperate with what you remember, I'll cut you in for a quarter of a million bucks. That is if the gold is still where I think it is. Gold? - No, gold is very bad luck for Indians. - How about cash? Cash, ah, that's different. You go all the way with me and I'll take you to Maria Bonita. I know right where she is in Manila. I guarantee to produce her, that is if you cooperate. Hey, why don't you take me to her now, huh? Oh, no. I want you to keep your mind on your work. Suppose I told you to go to hell? Many disadvantages for you, my friend. Many disadvantages. Number one, no quarter of a million dollars. And number two, no ticket back home. - And number three, no Maria Bonita. - I'll find her myself. You don't know Manila, my friend. You can get killed for a gold tooth. And I'll tell you something else. I just may press charges against you. - You damn near killed me last night. - Oh, I wouldn't hurt nobody. - I just look mean, I wouldn't kill nobody. - Nobody? Well, only three guys, once. That's water. It doesn't look like much of a jail to me. You're wrong, Pat. Too tough for three men to take. Huh. You can say that again, buddy. It's a fort. Hey, can't you bail the guy out? Ain't that the easy way to do it? No bail for him. A religious thing. Offense against a Muslim girl. Yeah, he's right, I tried to bail him out. So, let's do what we have to do and get the hell out. Yeah, I think you're right. What do you think, Draco? Well, it's a strong place. Strong places need strong action explosives. Kaboom! Kaboom! Hansen! Hansen! Hansen! Hansen! Yeah, what do you want? We're from Pat Morrison, we're bailing you out. Man, let's go. Prisoner, stop! Prisoner, stop! Package for you. Interruption. A delivery. Okay, Pat, I take the responsibility. I told Jones he could go. It meant so much to him just to see his daughter play. I told you to keep him close at home. Oh, man, you got a heart of stainless steel. The man is a cardiac, remember? The excitement could kill him. He needs care and protection. Naturally. The goose must be kept safe. Okay, okay, I'll send Nolasco to bring him home. Now, move in, honey, move in, move in. That's it, stay low. Stay low. Now, move in. That's it. - Just stay low, stay low. - You like the game, do you? Oh, yes, she's really very good. - She could be a champion. - I'm doing a story on her, actually. From the point of view of the man from the street. - You a reporter? - Yes, yes. Her game is reminiscent of her father, I think. I saw him play Felicisimo after the war. Lovely girl, terribly attractive, excellent style, and... Somebody call an ambulance. You know, I can beat you, only I took a tranquilizer before match. You sure is wasn't a sleeping pill? Oh, smile for the cameras. What's your friend's name? I don't know. I just saw he was in trouble. - Please observe. No money. - I observed. His name is Trevelyan Jones. ♪ I've traveled the ocena, I've traveled the sky ♪ ♪ I'll tell you a story to make a man cry ♪ ♪ I'll tell you a story So tragic and wrong ♪ ♪ It'll grab you and stab you ♪ ♪ Your heart will go "bong” ♪ ♪ This chick was as groovy as ever there was ♪ It can't be. ♪ She went on a trip, got caught by the fuzz ♪ - You again. - Your ichi-ban fan. I warned the entire hotel staff not to let you in. I thought you would, so I came from above. Above? Yeah, those dear, sweet, little painter men. They lowered me down from the roof on their scaffold thing. You know they wouldn't take anything? I offered to kiss them, but they said they were married. I guess they've got their Freudian hang ups too. So I gave them a daisy. You would. Well, I hope you're going to be very comfortable out there. But just remember one thing, reality is down below, 10 stories down. Nice cold cement. I'm confining my mind-bending to pot. No acid. If you've got any marijuana on you, you get rid of it right now! I'm not about to land in jail over you. When I want grass, I know where to get it, man, and that's where I'll smoke it. I suppose that's the first thing you checked out when you got here. First things first and now things now. Here you follow me from Beverly Hills to Forest Hills, from Wimbledon to Sydney, to Honolulu, to here. Why? Because I love you. I love everybody, All the beautiful people. - Are you high? - No. Look, if you're such a dedicated hippie, why aren't you in San Francisco? Why aren't you in Los Angeles, on the Strip? Doing whatever it is you do. What do you call it? - Doing your thing? - But I am doing my thing. My thing is watching you play. You're like a cat. Today you were out of sight. I get high just watching you. If you want to spend your money following me around, I guess that's your business. Your bag. The folks have plenty, besides they like to have me several thousand miles away from home. I wonder why. Look, just don't get under foot or I'll step on you. - Don't you ever take a bath? - It's not macrobiotic. It's not natural. You know, it's bad for the oils in your skin. I say you stink and you're gonna take a bath. - I'm okay the way I am. - You're gonna take a bath. No! - Come on. - No! Ow! - Hey! - Bath time. Okay. I'm going. I'm going. I'm going. Happy birthday, Grandfather. - Hi, Pat. - Where are they? Over there by the bar. Excuse me, ladies. This little old 37mm casing is what started Morrison on this whole crazy deal? But you fill that up with gold, melted gold. It gets importance. The Americans hid seven million in gold on. Corregidor in casings like that one. - The Japanese only found half of it. - Afternoon, gentlemen. That's right. The other half is in these, ah, same type shells. Only much better hidden. By a genius named Colonel Jacoby. And just how do you know definitely that the Japs didn't find it... We don't call them "Japs" anymore, Hansen. They're good friends now. How do you know that the Japs didn't find the whole schmear? After all, they occupied Corregidor for, what was it, four years, three-and-a-half? Well, I'll tell you why, Hansen, because, uh... Because American intelligence assigned Jacoby to take a special detail of men to hide that gold. And he hid it so well, even they couldn't find it. There were no records. And, uh, Jacoby died on Bataan. Well, I'm glad you've got everything all figured out. I take what you remember, what the Indian remembers, and Jesus. And Jones, especially Jones, because he's the last link on the chain. - Well, why isn't Jones here? - He's at my place in Manila. - But why? - Because he needs care, he's got a bad heart. - Chihuahua. - So, why do we need you? 'Cause every plan has to have a Jacoby. And I'm it. So, I take what all three of you know and what Jones knows. And I put it all together and, uh, I've got a complete picture. Same picture Colonel Jacoby had? - That's right. - Pat! Telephone call for you up here. - It's your girl in Manila. - Sherry. Miss Higginbottom! I want to go to Manila with you. You're going, you're going. Gotta work it out with Jesus. Give him a reason. Hello. What? Well, get on it, Sherry. Yeah, I know you are. I'll catch the first plane out of here. Goodbye. Damn it! - What happened? - Jones is missing. Such poverty amid such luxury. What're you, on a trip or something? Oh, my dear, I haven't been out of Manila for months. What's your bag, man? - I beg your pardon? - What do you want? I'm, uh, looking for Miss Barbara Jones. I'm Barbara Jones. Uh, Miss Jones. It's about your father. - My father? - Your father. - Come in. - Thank you. What did you say your name was? Oh, just call me The Wombat, as I'm jocularly known to all of Manila. The roving reporter, the swinger of the press. - What about my father? - Wouldn't you like to know where he is? What kind of a crude practical joke is this? I'm not interested in making jokes, madam, I'm here to see if you're interested in some information about your father. If you had any information about my father, you'd know that he was dead. He was lost at sea a year ago. No, my dear, you're quite distressingly wrong, and quite happily wrong, if I may say so. Disappeared, yes. Dead, no. Your father is alive, more or less. Do you mind if I sit down? Uh, yes. What do you mean, more or less? Your father is alive, but a cardiac. Your father is Trevelyan Jones. Former captain, U.S. Army. Captured at the fall of Corregidor by the Japanese, May, 1942. He was more than a fair tennis player. He was a champion before I was born. How can you assure me he's alive? I saw him, my dear. Not 40 minutes ago. My God! - Where is he? - Oh, I can't tell you that. What do you mean? Well, you see, he's in trouble and it'll take a bit of money to get him straightened out before I can see him again. What kind of trouble? - Trouble. - Well, how much does he need? $500. I don't have enough. Take whatever you need. - Let's go. - Uh, one moment, my dear, there's another consideration in our arrangement. I watch you play tennis, my dear, and you're a fawn. A Minerva, a dream on the court. Your flashing bare limbs, very exciting. - What are you driving at? - As a man to woman and, uh, vice versa, we could come to terms better, my dear, if you would dismiss this creature. You go to hell, you creep. These contracts between man and woman of obvious mutual physical advantages are made every few seconds all over the world. You dirty rotten chiseler. - Uh, what about your father? - Get out of here. Madame, I withdraw. Like I said, you're out of sight. - You are Miss Bobby Jones, aren't you? - Yes. What is it? Well, where's your father? I'd like to talk to him. Wait a minute. Please, wait a minute. You're the second person who's tried to pull something. Now, what's your story? I'm not trying to pull anything, I'm serious. Haven't you seen him? Look, whoever you are, my father is dead. Won't you give me 10 minutes of your time to prove you're wrong? Your father's very much alive. I met your father about three years ago. I knew then he was avoiding somebody, but I didn't find out until later it was you. - He was avoiding me? - Yeah. Where did you say you saw him? A few days ago. He was staying at my place. I had somebody looking after him. I don't believe you. You're a fraud and I can prove it. - Really? - I have a wire at my hotel. It was sent a year ago, stating that my father was lost at sea. Miss Bobby Jones, Vesuvio Hotel, Naples, Italy. Regret to inform you, your father, Trevelyan Jones, lost at sea this date. Signed, John Morgan. First Officer, SS Montgomery, bound for Sydney. - Are you Morgan then? - No. My name is Morrison. Pat Morrison. I made up the wire and the name. What a lousy, cruel thing to do. He didn't want to interfere with your life. He wanted to stay out of it, completely out of it. He was always afraid that he'd do something wrong and it would reflect on you. That's ridiculous. Maybe. That's the way some men act. Especially when they're stoned most of the time. Problem was to keep him off the booze and on the pills. I guess you knew about his drinking. I knew about the drinking, but what are the pills for? Well, he developed a cardiac condition. - That's what he said too. - Who said? Never mind. Have you been taking care of him ever since you sent that wire? - Yeah. - Why? I like him. He's got qualities I like in a man. Sincere, honest, you know. - I know. - Except now he disappeared. You just said that you saw him a few days ago. Yeah, I know, I know. I had to go out of town on some business, and while I was gone, he insisted on seeing you play tennis with that Japanese doll. - The nurse let him go. - He was there? Yeah, while he was watching the match he had a slight attack. They took him to the hospital and he was later released to a friend. I thought that friend was you. Then what that nut said at the hotel was the truth. What nut? He called himself The Wombat. This is the guy we're looking for. All right, you all know what areas you're gonna cover. - He calls himself Wombat. - Wombat, what's that? Hell, I don't know. He doesn't have any known address. What does the guy do, live in a barrel? All we know about him is he's a small time chiseler and blackmailer. He sells scandal to the scandal sheets. What's too juicy to print, he takes a payoff. Well, in that case, we've better look for him in a sewer. Well, then let's see if we can smell him out. Hello, Joe. Hey, Joe, come on in. Hey, Joe, buy me a drink. Yes, sir? - Give me a beer. - Hello, Joe. Oh, the ugly American, huh? - Who is Maria Bonita? - She's the owner. - No kidding? The boss, eh? - That's right. Why, you know her? Maybe. Could be. - Tell her a friend's here. - I'm sorry, but she's busy upstairs. You be a good boy and tell her a friend's here. I'm sorry, I told you she's busy. I told you to tell her a friend is here! - I told you I can't. - Listen, Joe, call her! Maria Bonita! Maria! Oh, it's the Indian! That crazy Indian. Oh, heavenly days! I thought you were dead. Sam, bring whiskey, a full barrel. We've got to celebrate. You're buying, right? You know, I've been waiting for you so many, many years. Hey, hey, Draco, come back, here! Where are you going? Don't you have a big tennis match tomorrow? Yeah, it's the toughest. It's the playoff for the Philippine championship. Well, I thought tennis players were like violin players. They had to practice all the time. I do, but this is far more important. - Well, you'll win it. - Why do you say that? Well, you're Trev Jones's daughter, aren't you? Well, you'd better scratch that one. You haven't been corny yet. You know, I don't get you at all. You must have a pretty important reason to be looking after him. He's a lovely guy. Isn't that enough? Hey, are you gay? Yes. But I think you could save me. Where have you been? Can't you get down to Manila more often? I miss you. - I've been very busy. Something big. - Oh? Did you bring some hot pearls for me to sell? I have a real good contact in Tokyo. Do you know him? Yes, I do. And I wouldn't do any dealings with him. Except by telephone, and then that would be only hello and goodbye. Some of the best thieves I know avoid him like a snake. - What do you want with him, anyway? - Oh, just looking for him. No, I don't know where he is. I only deal with high-class sharpshooters. Hey, wait a minute, I've got something to show you. I think this will interest you. How about that? This is one of the finest black pearls I've seen. - And I think I know where you got it. - You do? My wife Mariko gave it to you to have it set, right? Wrong. Pat Morrison sent it to me for re-sale. Call came in about an hour ago. Said a guy wanted 1,000 bucks for her old man, eh? - Was it the same guy that came to see her? - That Australian creep? - Yeah. - Nah. No, it was a different kind of voice. Funny kind of accent, really freaky. - Freaky? - Yeah, yeah. Well, was it Chinese, or was it Filipino, or what the hell was it? - On the telephone, how could I know? - Yeah. He sounded... He said something funny. He called me ma'am sob, ma'am something. - Memsahib? - Yeah, that's it. Sounds East Indian. Anything else? Oh, he must have called from a farm or something. I could hear all these roosters in the background, really making the scene big. You know how they go? Thanks, huh? Let's go, honey, I think I got a lead. There. Sir, that man, his name is Kuli. The one with the white cock. He knows The Wombat. Kuli! Where's The Wombat? Move, move. Out of the way. You want a girl? I'm too tired. I thought you'd never get back. Well, did you catch him? No. But I had an interesting tour of Manila. - Sit tight, huh? - Right. Afternoon. - Closed today. All day. - Ah! I've got some keys here. Uh, they belong to Kuli, is he around? - Oh, Kuli. - Yeah. - Kuli back there in office upstairs. - I'll take them to him, huh? Yeah. Come in. - Who are you, what do you want? - Mr. Wombat. Hello, Kuli. Pat, I'm up here. Take it easy, Jonesy. I'll be up in a minute. You know the conditions? You brought the money? Yeah, I know the conditions. I'll take the money first. Well, the money's in the car. I didn't know you'd have Jonesy here. - Where in the car? - I'll get it for you. Where in the car? It's in the glove compartment. Keys are in the ignition. You're not very careful. Kuli, fetch. - Nice place you got here. - Yes. Pat, look out! - Are you all right? - Yeah. Your father's up there. I don't care what you thought or might think. You had no right to cut me out of your life that way. You should have let me make my own judgment. You're right. I was an old fool. And I love you. He's been great, Bobby. Absolutely great. Hey, Pat. It was about 25 paces. Hey, you take it easy, old man. - But, I thought... - No, no, you need your rest. I think we should go, huh? It's so good to have you back. I'll see you later. - What was that all about? - What? What are you up to? What's your bag, as Penny would say? I'm in the salvage business. I, uh, collect tennis players. - Know where I can find one? - I'm serious. Why are you so considerate of an alcoholic drifter on the road down? Is that what you think of him? No, I don't think of him that way. He's my father, I love him. Answer me! I told you before. I guess one of the main reasons is I feel sorry for him. I wouldn't want him to know it, but I do. You have to feel sorry for someone with an obsession on his back. What I don't understand is how can it be an obsession with him when he's got facts? He's got provable facts. - You know what I mean? - Yes, I know, but nobody believes him. One day he disappeared. They found him seven months later in the Malinta tunnels half out of his mind. You know what they did? They committed him to a federal prison in Missouri. Springfield, where they put the federal nuts. He had to be examined, "As to his competency to hold a reserve officer's commission" "in the service of the United States." And six months later, they took his commission away from him. Something he was very proud of. Then they kicked him out of the service. That killed his identity. Come on. I tell you this. My father is no weakling. He never was a weakling. They broke him. There's a big difference between being a weakling and a man who is broken. What about the 25 paces? That's what I really wanted to ask you. You know, I have know a lot of women in my life. I wouldn't doubt that. They always have one thing in common, suspicion. Built-in, radar controlled suspicion. Naturally. Otherwise we'd all be pregnant at 14. Why'd you hush-up my father when he mentioned the 25 paces? Because it's something that shouldn't be discussed in hospitals or restaurants. Because what we're attempting to do is illegal. What's to stop you, once you find the gold, from just leaving my father up there in that hospital bed? You know, that's an idea, I never thought of that. Let's suppose I did just that, took the gold and went off on my own. - What's the first thing that would happen? - Tell me. Well, the Army would know we'd been there. They'd realize that we found out where the gold was. The United States government would know your father was right all along, maybe apologize to him. Possibly give back his commission. - Right? - Maybe. But I wouldn't do that because... I know, because you like him. He's sincere, he's honest. That's right. These three years, you've been taking care of him. It had nothing to do at all with the fact he gave you the idea about the gold? I can't be prejudiced against a man because he might make me rich. And the wire you sent, was your explanation about that the truth? He was eating himself up with guilt complexes, drinking too much. After the wire, he calmed down a little bit. I didn't know you then. Otherwise I never would have sent the wire. Good luck tomorrow, huh. It's gonna be tough, the Tigress of the Philippines. - No, you'll murder her. - I'm sure gonna try. You know, I think I like you. There it is. I never thought I'd see the rock again. Corregidor. What got me, there wasn't a puking thing to drink on that puking rock for weeks. Chihuahua. What a way to live. You know, this is loco, wearing coveralls, acting like a salvage crew. We are a salvage crew. 11:14, right on schedule. Let's go. I still don't understand why you didn't come on the boat with us. I told you before. I had a lot of last minute details I had to take care of. They pay you three million in gold, huh? - Hundred thousand ounces. - A hundred thousand ounces. - Well, that doesn't sound so heavy. - Six thousand pounds. Six thousand pounds? It takes four men to move that? We'll move it. We got to find it first. Now, we go straight ahead to lateral K. H. I- J. Next one. Okay, this is it. This is where we started from. All right, there were you three, - Jones and, uh, Jacoby, right? - That's right. We were pushing a hand truck on rails, more like a flat car. - It was loaded with ammo cans. - It was locked and heavy as hell. Now, just exactly from what point did you start? - Started right about here. - Then he made a little speech. Oh, he was full of speeches about... The less we knew what we were doing, the better for all of us. Uh, but he could tell us that the cans were filled with a lot of files and secret codes and all that stuff. And he started us here and blindfolded us. - Who's first. - Me. All right, let's go. Okay, Draco, you first. Come on now, right here. Now, who was second? Second. And he told us to get in line like this. All right, hold this. - Can't we just close our eyes? - No, we can't just close our eyes. We want you to be just exactly the way you were when it happened. All right, Indian, go on. Well, then he told me, "Draco, take your last name, that's five letters." "Multiply them by five, that's 25." "Now walk 25 paces. When you reach 13, turn to your left" "and continue walking until you reach the 25." Okay. All right, let's go. One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, 10, 11, 12, 13. We turned to our left here. Fourteen, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25. This is what I felt when we got here. What? Oh. It's quartz. For 25 years, I've been wondering what that was. - Jacoby left you here, right? - Right. - I'm leaving you here. - Oh no. I'm going with you. Last time I didn't know what I was doing. This time I do. Hold this. Hansen, what was your number? Three. Three times six, Hansen, is 18. Okay. One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, 10, 11... 14, 15, 16, 17, 18. - What are you doing? - I remember. I remember there was a current of air up there somewhere. There! There! There's an air vent over to the right. All right, what happened then? They went on with the truck and I stayed here and waited. It seemed like forever. - Blindfolded? - Kept it on. Well, didn't that seem odd? When the Army tells you to do a thing a certain way, you do it. Jesus. - What was your key number? - Four. - Riley. Four times five is 20, right? - That's right. - All right, let's go. - Wait. I pushed the truck for 12 paces. Then I stepped on something wet. Yeah, wet. Then to the left, continued pushing the truck. I took 20 paces, then Jones took over. All right, let's go. One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, 10, 11, 12. I told you it's wet. I told you it's wet. Yeah, I know, there's a drain down here. All right, let's go. Thirteen, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20. All right. Jones says 25 more steps. Twenty-five more steps and we'll all be rich. One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, 10, 11, 12, 13. Jones said 25 steps. The track ends here. Where the hell did I go wrong? I don't know, Pat, I just don't know. Well, everything went perfect, but up to your end. After Jesus, I walked it for you. After 14 paces, the tunnel ended, and so did the tracks. I ran smack into a solid wall. Well, what does that suggest to you? I know what you're gonna say, that the wall wasn't there when you went in. That Jacoby built the wall when you left, but Jacoby left with you. No! - No, he didn't. - He didn't? After we left Jesus, Jacoby and I went on alone. - I pushed the truck 25 paces. - Twenty-five paces. He took off the blindfold and I helped him load the gold into a ventilator shaft. - On the right hand side? - Yeah, half way out. After we finished loading the gold, he put the blindfold back on, walked me back to a certain spot, took the blindfold off, told me to pick up the rest of the fellows and take off. Well, when did he come out? I don't know, I... I assumed that he came out later. But I never saw him again. - The point is where did he come out? - Pat. There's got to be another entrance to bypass that wall. Thank you, thank you very much. And now, it is my pleasure to present to you the winner of the Western Pacific Women's Open, Miss Mary Custom. Trev, you've got to think. Come on, there's got to be something left out. We were under steady attack, Pat. It was a very confusing time, you know? And guns were hitting us from Bataan, our air power was gone. Oh, we were firing back all we could. Wait a minute. Where we buried the gold, there was a steady thump of the mortars overhead. - You mean, you were under a battery? - Yeah. Yeah. Four 12-inch mortars. How do you know they were mortars? Oh, hell, as an old artillery man... We were under Battery Way. - It could have been Battery Geary. - No! Geary was out with a direct hit. We were under Battery Way. Battery Way? - How are you feeling? - Oh, fine, fine. - How did it go? - The usual. Sorry you weren't number one. - Two's better than three. - That's right. Penny, would you take me up to my room, please? Yes, sir. - We'll talk later? - Right. I, uh, hope in a couple of days I can get rid of that - crackpot label on your dad. - I hope so. - Goodnight. - Goodnight. - Goodnight. - Goodnight. Going down? All right, we're gonna take another crack at it. This is where we stand. I found out how Jacoby got out of that tunnel. He built a stairway up above Battery Way. That's where we'll go in. Now, the island is crawling with soldiers. There's a security patrol that comes by the south side dock every 45 minutes. Except at lunch time. That's 11:30 to one. A gap of 90 minutes. In that 90 minutes, we gotta get the gold, load it aboard the boat and get out of there. - Is that clear? - What if there's a hitch? We run into an obstacle? Well, a lot of horse races have been lost at the finish line. That tennis star is outside with your car. I'd be glad to take her back to the hotel for you. No, I want to talk to her. We're gonna be fighting the time clock, gentlemen. One foul-up, one delay, and we've had it. - Hi. - Hi. - How's your father? - Oh, he's just coming along fine. He's a little too excited. A bit too tense. Well, you can't blame him for that. - You know what's great about you? - No, but you tell me. What you've done for him. You've given him back his faith and his hope. Well, the great thing is what I'm gonna do for us. I've got a lot to be grateful for. When you were a little girl, didn't you, uh, learn how to be grateful? I mean, where's your upbringing? All right, get it off your chest. I have never killed a man. Not even in the war, I don't think. Well, what does a man say when he's caught with his pants down? It is not funny. I mean it. I'm sure you do. I like sincerity, even in a killer. But don't you think you'd better wait until after Corregidor? I know she looks at you. Then she looks at me. But I love her. And I want you to leave her alone. Just get away from her. She is my wife and I love her. I love her. Don't worry. She's your wife. All yours. It won't happen again. Okay? What's wrong, amigo? - Chihuahua. - Chi-wa-what? I have the worst luck with women, amigo. Disastrous, disastrous. You can say that for me too. They are like hour glasses. You turn them upside down, they all look alike. Yeah, I guess you're right. Jesus, come here. Take over. Hey, why don't you lay off that stuff? Do you want to blow the whole deal? - I'm in good shape. - Oh, yeah, you're in good shape, for a pollywog. What do you mean pollywog? All tail and no direction. You should have stayed on the reservation. Hansen! Hansen! Hansen! - What gives, man? Take it easy. - Ah, the son of a bitch. Someday I'm gonna Kill that bastard. What the hell is going on? There was nobody here the other day. - Shall I turn back? - No, no, we've gotta keep going. He says we cannot enter, it's a restricted area. Tell him we've got an official contract. He says we need a special pass. Look, tell him we've got orders to remove a small number of fused shells from one of the batteries. It's to protect their people. - What's he stopping here for? - Well, I didn't go to church this morning. I'm going to pray. I'll be back in a minute. - You're late, what happened? - They stopped us. They wouldn't let us through unless the soldiers came with us. - Well, bring them in here. - But how? I don't care how, just bring them in. Hey, soldados, come here. Hurry, hurry! Come on, come on. Look, look! Bring him over here. - Are you crazy? - Put the gun away. I think you're making a mistake. I said put the gun away! Come on, get the lift. Over here. Stash the guns. Draco, give me the big light. That's the other side of Jacoby's wall. Turn on the light. Fifteen, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25. Well? That's where the ventilator is supposed to be. Let me at it. Damn! Aye, Chihuahua! - Is the truck down below? - Yeah, it's all set. All right, let's get the rest of this gold out of here. Jesus, come on with me. Boy, I could sure use a beer. Yeah, you could always use a beer. Careful! What's the matter with you, you stupid idiot? Well, it slipped. Yeah, that's the trouble with you and your people, you're stupid. - What do you mean "my people"? - You know what I mean. Listen, Mac. I can't change your thinking, but I can sure rearrange your face. Why don't you try it? I don't have the saw! - So, where is it? - It's in Draco's pack. Well, that was smart. I'll get it. All right! We've wasted enough time already. Now, take the saw up to Jesus. Go on, take it. - That crummy Indian... - Just shut up! Let's get that gold out of here. Come on. Here she goes. - That's the last one, right? - Right. - You got it? - Yeah. - Okay? - Okay. You take the boat to Mindoro. You know where, I'll find you. - You know you will. - What do you mean? We got the gold, Dad. Yeah. See ya. I'll see ya. Hansen, look! ♪ Old yellow gold It ain't where it used to be ♪ ♪ Ain't where it used to be Ain't where it used to be ♪ Draco, look, look.
