(tense music) (subdued piano music) (alarm buzzing) (kettle whistling) (pigeons cooing) - [Man] Hey, fellas. Show a little bit of manners. (grunts) (dog growling) - Oh, shh, Bossy. Oh, off on a trip, Mr. Brackin? - Oh, no, Mrs. Hampton. We're just putting some shelves up in the office. It's easier if we do it ourselves. - They're making you work on a Saturday? - Well, we're a little bit behind. Mr. Gaylord asked a few of us if we'd care to volunteer. - [Mrs. Hampton] Oh, well. Not much choice, I suppose. Will you be home for dinner? - Yes, of course I will, Mrs. Hampton. Why shouldn't I be? (tense music) (bike squeaking) - [Woman] Morning, Gene. - [Gene] Good morning. - Would you like a bite? Going somewhere? - Uh, yes, Ms. Ladd. After work, I'm going to visit with my aunt. She lives out of town. - [Ms. Ladd] That's an awfully big case for half a weekend. - [Gene] It is the only suitcase I have. - Oh, Gene, you disappoint me. I was hoping you'd say you had two tickets to some tropical paradise and you'd go mad if I didn't run away with you. I mean, maybe one day, darling, you and I alone on a far away island. I get goosebumps just thinking about it. Fat chance on our salary, right? (bike squeaking) - The liberties some people take. - Oh, Sally was just having a little bit of fun, Mrs. Talmage. - Well, sometimes I think you and I are the only ones who adhere to proper procedures in this office. Without procedure, there'd be chaos. - Yes, I suppose you're right, Mrs. Talmage. Without procedures, chaos. (knocks on door) - This Rhinehart report, first rate. Absolutely top drawer. It'll impact the hell out of them at the front office. - Thank you, kind master. - Look, I know you had better things to do then to come in here on a Saturday. It won't go unnoticed come your evaluation time. Myself, I was planning on flying back to The Big Apple. Be with the missus. You know, after six months in this hole. - I happen to have been born in this hole, Lar. - Uh-huh. And it doesn't show one bit. Listen, why don't you let me make it up to you? You... We deserve a day to unwind, to relax. And I do have a company expense account. Ask me how's business. - How's business, Lar? - Business is great. What do you say? Ah. Excuse me. (laughs) (tense music) (blowing) (humming) (metal clicks) - [Sally] Mrs. Talmage. - Thank you. (pigeons cooing) (key clinks) (clears throat) (pigeons cawing) Well, it's nice to see somebody who still has some respect for the company. Have a nice weekend, Eugene. (humming) - [Sally] Come on, Eugene. It's quitting time. - Everyone, thank you for today. I think you all did a super job. And come payday, you can expect a little something for your trouble. - No trouble, Mr. Gaylord. I enjoy working. - Well, ciao. See you guys on Monday. Goodnight. (metal rattling) Hey, Larry. There's a lock on the door. - No, there isn't. It's probably just jammed. - I can recognize a bloody bicycle lock, Larry. I'm telling you, someone's locked up the door. (tense music) - What is this? Somebody's idea of a joke? Hmm? Joan, call security. - Right away, Mr. Gaylord. - No need to, Mrs. Talmage. I put the lock on the door. - You did? Well, take it off. - I threw away the key. - What? Gene. - You did what? If you didn't want to work today, you could've said something. You could've called us. Well, I'm not gonna put up with this kind of stunt. And this is not coming out of my paycheck. (gun fires) (screaming) - I'm sorry to frighten you. I don't want to hurt anybody, really. Just do what I say and everything will be all right. - [Sally] Why have you taken us hostage? - Because. - Because? What kind of answer's that? - Will you just put that end through underneath the arms of the chair and attach it to his other wrist, please? - Oh, my god, Eugene. We've worked together for three years. A couple hours ago we were having coffee together and now you're chaining us up. What do you want? - I don't want anything. Sally, will you put these on yourself, please? - No. No, what Sally means is, every hostage taker has demands. Now, do you want money? Look, take my wallet. And you can have my watch. - [Eugene] No. - You don't want money? - Do you want to make a political statement? Do you want to save something? Is that what you wanna do? - Like whales, or baby seals, or squirrels, or something? - Mm-mm. - No. - What's going to happen to us? - I'm not sure exactly, but we're gonna be here for a while. (phone ringing) Hello? Oh, hello, Mr. Talmage. No, she hasn't left yet. Um, no, I'm afraid she can't come to the phone right now. Oh, no, no, she's fine. It's just that we have a sort of situation here. Well, I'm sort of holding everybody hostage. Yes, well, perhaps it would be a good idea to call the police. But be sure to tell them not to try and come into the building or I'll have to start shooting people. Now, don't make any sudden movements. - Look, don't panic. Remember who we're dealing with here. It's Eugene. I can handle him. He's a piece of cake compared... Shit. - The police will be here soon. It's important this bit goes smoothly so we don't commit any accidents. Mrs. Talmage, please. If the telephone rings, will you answer it and let me know who it is? (sirens wailing) They're very quick. (tires squealing) - Hey, what's this all about, Officer? - We got a call claiming and employee of Felton, one Eugene Brackin, is holding three people hostage inside. - Eugene Brackin? You're shittin' me. He wouldn't hurt a fly. - Yeah, well let's hope you're right. Call the chief, he's weekending with his kid. Tell him not to bother. (siren wailing) - Too late, Joe. - Shit. The guard says this Brackin guy is a jelly roll. Could be it's just some punks jerking us around a bit. - Maybe. Talmage is a member of the Granite Club. Not prone to schoolyard pranks. We'll take a look-see. I want everybody in vests. Nobody goes in or out of this plant without my say so. I'll take this vehicle. This the only entrance? - Yes, sir. - Thought you were gonna get a haircut, McGregor. - Yes, sir. - [Chief] Open up. Which office is it, you know? - [Joe] Market Analysis, third floor. You think it's just some kids fucking around? - [Chief] The window, get down! - [Joe] Shit. (gun fires) God, I should've stayed in fucking bed. - Whoever he is, he's not fuckin' around. - [Joe] Son of a bitch. (gun fires) (explosion booms) Fuck! Let's get out of here! - [Chief] Son of a bitch had me dead in his sights. - Nobody's hurt. - Oh, my god. (tires squeal) - [Joe] McGregor, prepare to move in the heavy equipment. Mobile HQ, ambulances, lights, the whole nine yards. - What's the number in that office? - [Guard] 3859. - Get down, get back. - [Guard] Jesus H Christ. Eugene Brackin firing a rifle? Jesus H Christ. I don't fuckin' believe this. (phone ringing) (gasps) - Um, you answer it, please, Mrs. Talmage. - Market Analysis, Mrs. Talmage speaking. - Mrs. Talmage? Are you all right? - Uh, yes. Yes, I am, thank you. To whom do you wish to speak? - Is Eugene Brackin there? - Yes, he is. He may be indisposed at the moment. Whom should I say is calling? - This is Chief of Police Smolen, ma'am. - One moment, please. Mr. Brackin, there's a Chief Smolen on the phone for you. Can you take the call or shall I tell him to call you back at a more convenient time? - I'll take it, Mrs. Talmage. Hello? Chief. - Brackin? You Eugene Brackin? - Yes. - You know you're in big trouble, mister. - I didn't hurt anyone, did I? - What do you want? - Nothing. - You don't wanna play games with me, Brackin. - I'm sorry, but I really don't want anything. - [Smolen] That's ridiculous. What the fuck did you kidnap three people for? - No need to swear, Chief. - I didn't swear. Right. Hey listen, I'm sorry. Why don't you just explain to me exactly what you're doing. - I'm holding them. Isn't that what these things are all about? - You've abducted three innocent people. You've taken potshots at officers of the law with an illegal automatic weapon. You've willfully destroyed private property. And you have no demands? - Uh-huh. - I'm losing my patience, Brackin. - All right. Well, I demand that nobody tries to come into this building. And if anybody tries to enter here, I start shooting people. Is that what you'd like, Chief? And do you see that flagpole outside there in the front, the one with the rope attached to it? - Yeah, I see it. What about it? You want some revolutionary flag up there or something? - No, this isn't a joke, I'm serious. I need to use that to get some food in here. We're hungry. I want four dinners. - Dinners? What kind of dinners? - He wants to know what we'd like to eat. - What can we get? - Oh, I don't know. Anything we want, I suppose. - How about roast chicken? I was going to make roast chicken tonight. - No, let's do Chinese. I know this great place on Maplewalk. - Why don't you decide, Eugene? - I'd like steak. - Steaks will be fine. Right, everybody? - [Joe] Move it up! Move it! Move along there! I said, move it! Move your ass! Come on, move it! (people chattering) - Okay, so that three baked potatoes, two with sour cream, one French fry, four chef's salad with Thousand Island dressing. - And Mr. Gaylord would like a bottle of seltzer. - Uh, could you make that New York, please? - New York seltzer. - Done. Brackin, you have your party, you make your speech, you come on out of there. - No, not tonight. We're spending the night here. - [Officer] Shine the light up there. - Hey, what's going on? - [Officer] Get that light on him. - Turn that light off! - Brackin? Brackin, calm down. Listen. - Turn that light off! I decide what goes on here! - [Chief] Brackin, I'm shutting 'em off. - [Eugene] Get stuffed, Chief! It's not time to create a murder! - Get down there! - [Eugene] I decide when it's time! Don't disturb us again! - Brackin, can you hear me? There, I shut 'em off, Brackin. Pick up the phone and talk to me. Brackin, I've done everything you asked me. Brackin? Brackin! Brackin, will you pick up the phone and talk to me? Brackin, so help me. Will you answer me? - I'm sorry. I didn't mean to scare you. Would you like to be a little more comfortable? Undo the right one. Put it there. You too, Mrs. Talmage. - Oh, thank you. - Okay, Greg. Shoot, I'm all ears. - Well, we got a real jewel here, Mr. Mayor. We got a guy up there with a gun holding three Felton employees hostage. - What does he want? - Four steak dinners. - And? - Nada. Beyond that he's a blank. - Give him his goddamn dinners and drag his ass out of there. - I wish it were that simple, Steve, but I don't want anybody hurt. Guy's got an automatic weapon. God knows what else. - The nerve of that asshole pulling a stunt like this. In an election year. - This is not rare. - You don't like your steak, Mr. Gaylord? - I've worn softer shoes. - If you hold your knife a little bit low, you'll find it cuts better. - It's money. You're after the payroll, right? What? I'm sorry, I'm curious. It's a normal, natural, healthy thing to wonder why. - Certainly. - I'm sure Eugene has good reasons. - Thank you very much for your cooperation, Mrs. Hampton. You've been very helpful. This officer will take you home. - [Mrs. Hampton] Thanks. - Listen, if you think of anything else, anything at all, please. - It's right over here. (engine starts) - This is Brackin's apartment. We went through it with a bushy comb. - And? - Nothing. Place is a blank, just like him. - Terrific. I know less and it scares me more. - Of course, there's another reason, Larry. It's power. I'd do it for power. - Money is power. - Money is just paper. Power is something you can taste. - [Larry] What do you think, Joan? - [Joan] I'm sorry, what? - What would make you do it? - Why, I'd never harm anyone willfully. - But what if you had to take hostages and you had to hurt them to get what you wanted? - I'd never take a hostage, Mr. Gaylord. - What if we were in Russia, you know? And the government, they had your children. - I don't have any children. - Pretend. - Well, I suppose I could if I was angry enough. - Ha. (tense music) - Is everything all right? - Goodness, look at this mess. - No, no, no. You sit down, Mrs. Talmage. - I want an itemized account. I want to know to the last goddamn penny what this circus is gonna cost me. - Yes, Mr. Mayor. - And I want to know by tomorrow morning. - Tomorrow morning? Yes, sir, Mr. Mayor. - Do you have some idea when we're gonna get out of here? I mean, you are gonna ask for something, aren't you? - It's nice having guests. - Guests? This guy's getting very weird. I could understand if he was doing it for money. - Oh, Larry. You have a goddamn one-track mind. - He can't expect us to put up with this sort of thing for much longer. I mean, people have their limitations. - Larry. (tense music) - Excuse me. What's gonna happen to us? - [Man] Bark, you spineless little prick. Bark like a dog. You hear me, Eugene? (Eugene barking) Bark louder! - [Larry] Eugene, come here. (Eugene barking) - [Man] Louder! - [Larry] Eugene, come here. - [Man] Eugene! - Eugene! Eugene, come here! - Larry, damn it. - No. Eugene, goddamn it, you talk to me. Eugene, will you answer me? Will you talk to me? Come on, talk to me. - Shut up! - Eugene. Eugene, I want an answer. Answer me. - Shut up! - Eugene. - Shut up! - No, Eugene! - Will you talk to me? - Shut up! (gun fires) (people shouting) - No, Joan, don't! Don't! Don't be stupid! - That's enough! (grunts) (tense music) (Joan sobbing) - I wanna know what that was, Joe. Send somebody up there. - McGregor, it's yours. Move it. (blinds rattling) - Sally, Mr. Gaylord, go back over there, please. (chairs clattering) (tense music) Face the wall. (phone ringing) Promise you'll never do that again. - I promise. - Cross your heart and hope to die? - Cross my heart and hope to die. - Answer the phone. - Uh... Market Analysis, Mrs. Talmage speaking. - Are you all right? We heard a shot. - No one's been hurt. I just got a little carried away. I'll be more careful from now on. - Mrs. Talmage, please. Don't take any chances. Put Brackin on. - Mr. Brackin. - Yeah? - What the hell's going on in there? - Oh, Mrs. Talmage just got a little bit excited, that's all. Everything's all right, now. - Brackin, you gotta help me. I've got the mayor breathing down my neck. - No, Chief. We stay here until I decide we move, not you, not the mayor. I decide what happens. - Maybe I'm not making myself clear, Brackin. If you don't come out-- (phone clicks) Yeah, you get the message. - Is that our asshole? What happened? - [Greg] Nothing. He wants us to keep the noise down. They can't get any sleep in there. - Listen, Greg. I've already got a call from Marsh, the Felton president. He's concerned, very concerned, about any adverse publicity. - He sounds like a real humanitarian. - I don't need to remind you that the Felton Power Corporation services 250,000 people in the area. Which translates into 250,000 voters, eh? Angry voters that their power's gonna be shut off Monday morning. - You want him out dead or alive. - [Steve] I want to move fast. - Even Marsh wants him out. - Same damn thing. You sure you know what you're doing? - Positive. - All right. - Positive and negative. It's all relative, isn't it? - Gene, every prisoner's entitled to one phone call. - No. No phone calls. Mrs. Talmage, you're sleeping over there. - Oh. - I just think Marsh would appreciate a call, you know. Something to let him know that the plant's okay. - Jesus Christ, Larry. Don't you ever stop bucking for brownie points? - It's so goddamn hot in here. Don't those pipes ever shut off? - They would've if you'd signed the repair requisition they gave you last month. - Look, Sally. Let's you and I not fight, okay? We gotta come up with a plan. - Great, the heater doesn't work and it's going below zero tonight. - [Officer] Brackin's file's clean, Chief. No priors. He's been a good boy at work. Never missed a shift in 10 years. - Tear gas arrived yet? - Yeah. Don't let the mayor get under your skin, Greg. He's just doing his job. That's all any of us can do in this situation. Do our jobs. Bag it. - Your turn, Mr. Gaylord. - But why do I have to sleep on the floor? - We can't really ask the ladies to. - No, I can't leave. Listen, Jill, this is not a stickup at Shop Rite. No, don't keep the casserole warm. Look, I'm surrounded by psychos. Honey, the mayor's on my case. I can't... I can't move two inches in any direction without somebody jumping on my head. - Can we open a window? - Don't bother, Gene. It'll do Mr. Gaylord good to get a taste of his own medicine. - You bitch. - [Eugene] You'll sleep in the office, Sally. (tense music) - How come I get the royal suite? - 'Cause you're the nicest person. - That's very sweet of you. I think you're nice, too. Would you do me a favor and turn around? I just want to get out of these clothes. Can you shut off the light, please? Don't you just hate sleeping with clothes on? (Sally sighs) Blanket, please. You can turn around now. Thank you, Gene. I feel so much more secure now. Guess I should say goodnight. Goodnight. (soft piano music) - [Eugene] Where do I begin? In your eyes are the best of dark and bright? How can I presume? How should I presume? Arms that are braceleted barren white. Do I dare? So, this is the way the day ends. With yellow fog on the window panes. Do I dare? Do I dare? (tense music) (gun cocks) (gun fires) (people applauding) (Larry groaning) You okay? (Larry groaning) (boat horn blowing) - [Sally] Who is this guy? - Gaylord. Larry Gaylord. - That was my job. - Just hold it right there, Sally. I know you deserve the job more than that bozo, but my hands are tied. That's not why you're here though, is it? - No, that's not why I'm here, Burt. This fucking Mr. Larry Gaylord better be very, very good. - Greg, I got a meeting at 0900 with the chamber of commerce. What am I gonna say to them? When is that nut gonna surrender? - How the hell do I know, man? I'm not a mind reader. - Damn it, man, you're the police chief. It's your job to get him out of there. - It's my job to get him out alive. - Look, Greg, you've been doing a super job, ever since you first got here. I'm very proud of you. Local boy makes good. But I really think you need some help on this one. - Who? - Garlas. Special Weapons and Tactics. - Oh, shit. Steve, that's just what we need. RoboCop. - You'll still be in charge. I don't wanna see you fumble the ball, Greg. (uptempo piano music) (yawning) (phone ringing) - Hello, Chief. - [Greg] Good morning, Eugene. How's everybody doing, okay? - Yeah, they're fine. What you want? - Well, I just want to let you know that we've installed a new phone line here. A direct line from your office to the trailer. All you gotta do is dial nine. - Nine? Fine. - Look, I want you to throw in the towel. - Not until the circle closes. - The circle? What the hell are you talking about? Listen, if you force me to come up there, somebody might get killed. Now, you told me you didn't want to hurt anybody. - All right, tomorrow. I swear. - If anybody gets hurt, it's gonna be your fault. - [Eugene] Yours, if you betray me. - Your fault. - You wonder what makes a guy like that crack. - Who knows. Maybe it's something he ate. (door opens) - Morning, everybody. - Morning. - Good morning. - Princess Di slept well last night. - I didn't ask for your office, Larry. - [Larry] Not in so many words. - What's that supposed to mean? - Nothing. I just slept like shit last night. - And you look like shit, Lar. - I can't stand this shit anymore. - You know, I once read about this tribe in Borneo. You know, the fuckers with the bones in their noses. Anyway, when one of them goes loco, you know, besides fucking the livestock or something, they string the bugger up by his balls, slice his head open like a can of tuna, and scoop out his brains. - How did that honky redneck get trapped in that black man's body? - Admit it, Greg. You're breathing a whole lot easier now that the real pros are here. My boys got the whole fucking quadrant covered. Nobody can get out. - Nobody wants to get out or in, Sydney. - Yeah? Well, I say we go in and put the fucker out of our misery. - Then can we string him up by his balls and scoop his brains out? - I don't want you to worry, Joan. We'll be out of here pretty soon. - That's not what Mr. Brackin says. - Yeah. - [Reporter] This is a WKMX news update. Chief of police Greg Smolen is about to make a statement. - [Greg] We are confident that the situation will be resolved soon. The alleged perpetrator has claimed that he doesn't want to harm anybody. And so far, we have no reason to disbelieve him. - [Reporter] Thank you, Chief Smolen. Now to Lieutenant Garlas of the Hostage Insurgency and Kidnapping Squad. What can you tell us, Lieutenant? - [Sydney] We have a very sensitive situation here. There's a maniac with a rifle holding three people. We can't predict what he'll do. You see, these psycho types tend to be unpredictable. - No, that's not it. Not it at all. - [Reporter] Thank you, Lieutenant Garlas. Well, you heard it folks. - You don't think I'm a maniac, do you? - No. - No. We don't understand why you're doing this thing. Most people don't take hostages. - But everyone's crazy, Gene. We're all a bit crazy. - Yeah, but all of them to think that I'm crazy. This thing's gonna end soon. Every circle closes. If they think I'm crazy they won't put my in prison, they'll put me in a hospital. I've gotta do this first. - That's right, Gene. You do what you have to do. - Yeah, but what if he has to kill someone? - I'm not gonna kill anyone. I told you. - But remember, if you have to kill Sally, she'll understand. (computer beeps) - You people don't care about consequences, do you? If you'd shut your trap for a couple of seconds I'll tell you something, smart boy, all right? I've got four people whose lives are at stake in there and all you care about is your freaking ratings. Now, get out of here. - Do you know his name, sir? Sir, do you know his name? Sir, what is his name, sir? - [Joe] Let's go, let's go, let's go. You heard what the man said. Let's go, move it. - You couldn't resist opening your fucking trap, could you? - I just told it like it is, Boy Scout. What the fuck do you want me to do hold a prayer meeting? - [Greg] I want you to think before you speak. - Don't fucking patronize me, Smolen. I didn't get this job by farting around with my thumb up my ass. Now, get your fucking hands off me. - Come on, guys. Show some fucking decorum. People are watching. - You don't speak to the press, understand? Nobody. - [Man] Sir. Okay, okay, okay, listen. - It's all right. - He's losing it, man. (computer beeping) - Is there any seltzer left? - There's always the water cooler. - Tastes like shit. (bottle clatters) What do you say, Gene? Why don't you let us go? - No. - Think about our families. Think about Mrs. Talmage's husband. Think about my wife. They're gonna be worried sick. - I haven't finished yet. - Why not let me go? I could be like your go-between, your mediator. - You're always covering yourself, Larry. - Not true. I'm thinking about you. I'm thinking about us. - That's bullshit and you know it. - [Larry] What do you say, Gene? Come on. - [Sally] Stop it, Larry. - [Larry] No! - Leave him alone! - Come on, all I wanna do is talk with him. Why won't you let me do that, huh? - Because, you got a big mouth and it's dangerous. - Well, I'd take him into my office for a little private one on one, but you've already got that covered, haven't you? - You've got a filthy mind. - [Larry] Yeah? Well, why don't you tell us nothing's going on? - Nothing is going on! - That's bullshit! - Stop it! If you don't shut up, I'll shoot! I will! Now, shut the fuck up! (phone ringing) Hello. - Hey, Eugene. I wanna talk to you, man. - You didn't speak very nicely to me this morning and that man called me a maniac on the radio. I don't wanna talk to you. I'm sorry. (tense music) - You are one colossal asshole, Garlas. - What's the matter? - Brackin's furious about the interview. - Well, ain't that just too fucking bad? - From now on, mister, you don't breathe, let alone position a hitman, without clearing it with me first. You understand? - Greg. Greg? - [Greg] What? - You are mollycoddling that asshole and it's getting you nowhere. And running out of slack, huh? Something's gotta give. (phone ringing) - Hello. - Gene, listen to me. I can prove I'm your friend. Yes, I can. Now, you trust me. If I can prove it, can we be friends? - I suppose so. - Good. Now, I want you to be very careful. I want you to go over to the window, not the center, but to the edge of the window. Will the phone reach? - Yeah, it reaches. - Good. Now, carefully look out the window. You see those oil tanks across the way, the second one from the left? I want you to look along the top of the oil tank. See something there? - Yeah. Yeah, I see him. - It's a sniper, Eugene. He can hit a dime at 600 meters. He's there to shoot you, Eugene. You stand in that window for a second, you're dead. - Well, why would he want to kill me? I haven't hurt anybody. - Eugene, I have been trying to tell you. I don't want to kill you. But there are some people down here who think you want to stay up there forever. - Not forever. - [Greg] When, tomorrow? - Tomorrow, yes. - Tomorrow morning? - [Eugene] Maybe. - What is this maybe shit, Eugene? Come on. - What about the guy who wants to shoot me? - I will take care of the sniper, Eugene. I'll call you later, see how you're doing. - Jesus Christ. What are you, a fucking cop or a puffball? You could've lured that cocksucker to the window for my sniper. - [Eugene] If you betray me, Chief, you'll see. Before the clock strikes three. (tense music) - Everybody's coming down on us. Marsh, the plant union. They want this thing finished. Sid's ready to take him out. - Steve. Look, I'm not a psychiatrist, and neither are you, but that man is not a killer. Give him 12 hours. - I'll give that person nothing. (subdued piano music) - Strange Sins, the story of Lady Barbara and Jake the Slave. Two lovers torn apart by class and prejudice. Two lovers drawn together by a passion. I didn't think you went in for such hot stuff, Joan. - Well, back in high school I was the first one to own a copy of Lady Chatterley's Lover, the unedited version. It caused quite a stir, I can tell you. - [Sally] Bet you were a real hottie in school days. - [Eugene] Bang. - I was what you might call a modern girl. I was the first one to wear a two-piece bathing suit around the public pool. I was the first one to smoke. And I was the first... Well, let's just say I didn't think it was fair that the boys were having all the fun. - I agree. Would you excuse me. - Bang, bang. (tense music) Gene? (gasps) It's all right. I just came by to say that I think what you're doing is not terrible. I know some people are gonna say it's wrong and bad, but sometimes there is no right or wrong, or good or bad. You're going through with this. And when it's all over, we'll be released unharmed. - Sally, you wanna give me a hand here? Double time for hostage days. - [Sally] Please, don't let him bother you. He doesn't have your vision. - Damn bitch. - I can tell you can see things clearly. If you can do this, you can do anything. You are very, very powerful. That's why they're afraid of you. That's what everything's about in this world. Power. - Mr. Brackin, may I go to the ladies room? - [Sally] Me too, Joan. I'll join you. Can you grab my purse, please? - That door doesn't lock, does it? - No. (sighs) I know these things screw up you insides, but I'm in no mood for an accident. Kids should be wanted, don't you think? I'd like to have one one day. If the right man comes along. Fat chance of that happening in Mansfield. God, it's funny. You can work with someone for years and it takes something like this to get to know them. Like I was surprised to find that you don't have any children. Joan? - Yeah. I was pregnant in my sophomore year. I had an abortion. This doctor gave me these pills that were supposed to stop the bleeding. But I was so scared and ashamed. I... I thought they were pain pills. I threw them away. I felt that I deserved the pain. Well, three days later, I almost bled to death. - Wow. - So, I quit gymnastics, I quit college, and I married my boring high school sweetheart. Two years later, I found out I could never have children. And to this day, Robert doesn't know why. - I'm really sorry. - Well, I have nobody but myself to blame, that's for sure. - No, you were screwed by a system that protects men and punishes women. We do all the work, they make all the money. They sow their oats and we pay the price. All this talk of equality is still just talk. Nothing's changed. - Well, yes. But that's old history now. No point in crying about it. - You ready? - Nah, you go ahead, Sally. I'll be out in a minute. (tense music) - He's in the washroom with Joan. He didn't take the rifle. Get the rifle. Get the rifle. Move it. (Joan screaming) - What were you doing in there, Gene? - Tell us. - What were you doing to her? - I was just checking up. - Joan, are you all right? - Oh, it's my fault. - [Larry] You know, you're sick. We did exactly what you asked. How could you do this to her? - I didn't do anything! Now, stop treating me like a child! (phone ringing) Hello. Chief? - Yeah, it's me, Eugene. Listen, you're gonna be on your own for a while. I got things to do. - What? No, you can't leave. Not until the circle closes. - Come on, Gene. You're not the only punk in this town with a hair up his ass. I've got things to do. - If you go away, if you don't protect me, they'll pin me down. You can't leave until this thing's over. - Calm down, calm down. - [Eugene] They're gonna know what I'm doing. - You're not making a great deal of sense, Eugene. - You haven't been listening, Chief. - Eugene, I have been nothing but ears ever since I first spoke to you on this phone, but I'm not gonna keep hanging around if you're gonna keep talking in circles. Come on, guys, guys. Stop fiddling, will ya? Jesus. - He can't leave us now. - Circles. Circles. - It's a trick. He won't leave. He'll be there. I know, I can tell. He's just playing some little game. (phone ringing) - Ah. - He's there. (phone ringing) - Circles. Circles. - Please, Chief. (phone ringing) Don't leave me now. - Hollow circles, Chief. Rings of straw around stuffed fingers. It's not my time to whimper, but it's time for decisions and revisions. - [Greg] Which a minute will reverse. (subdued piano music) - I wanna go home. I wanna go home. - 260. 260. - [Joe] 260. - Joe, I'm sorry to do this to you. R&R's canceled. - [Joe] So, what's up, Greg? - I want you to make a run for me. (tense music) Let it roll. (phone ringing) - Leave it. Let it ring. I decide. - This thing's getting more and more twisted. Should've knocked him out when he was having his little fit. - I'm gonna risk getting my head blown off? - [Larry] I would've done something, except I'm chained up. - [Sally] You're a true hero, Lar. - Look. Do you think you could get him to drink? - Drink? - In my desk drawer, the deep one, there's a very large, very heavy bottle of scotch. - You have scotch? - Uh-huh. - I could use a drink. - You conned me into giving you an extra day. And like a jackass, I gave it. You know, you're worse than that maniac up there. You're holding this whole town at gunpoint. If you don't clean this whole thing up by morning, you can kiss your job goodbye. - Problems with the connection, Smolen? - You gotta make up your mind, Greg. You can't keep chasing your tail forever. Poetry. (Larry laughing) - Eugene, you know any jokes? - No. - Ah, I got another one. How do women hold their liquor? - Oh, you talk a lot when you drink. - Yes, I do. And so would Eugene. Pour him a drink. Come on, Eugene. Why don't you join us? You know, after all, it's your party. - [Joan] How do they? - What? - Hold their liquor. - By the ears. - Ew. (Sally laughing) - All right, speech, speech. - Oh, no. I wouldn't know what to say. - Oh, come on, Eugene. Say something. Hey. - Mr. Brackin, you must make a speech. - Well... I know you're all very angry with me. And I don't usually do things that I don't usually do. That's why this is so important, so right. It's not so bad, really. If I hadn't have done this, we wouldn't have gotten to know each other the way we have. Finally, I'd like to tell you that I love you. - Oh. - Can I have another drink? - Absolutely. - It's music time. Woo! - You feeling all right, Sydney? Did I hear you advise patience to the mayor? - Don't get all bent out of shape, choir boy. Sooner or later, your good buddy's gonna do you in for me. But in the meantime, what do you say you and I kill a few games of poker? Five card stud, you and me. - [Greg] Got your chips, Hollis? - Never leave home without 'em. - There you go, Joan. There's something that ain't rock and roll. - [Sally] Yeah. - Ooh. (Joan mouthing music) Mr. Brackin, could you unchain me so I could dance just a little? (uptempo jazz music) - Those poor bastards must be going through hell. Do you think he's torturing them? - [Greg] No. - Like shit he ain't. (uptempo drum music) - [Sally] Yeah, Joaney. (laughing) - [Joan] Shake it, Sal! All right. Yeah, ha! Woo! Get down! - [Sally] Oh, jeez. (Joan laughing) - Aha! I knew Jones was a drinker. - Queens. (laughs) I accept checks, plastic, whatever you got. - Hey, you throw a wild party, Gene. I need some more fuel. - You've had enough. Why not get Eugene a drink? - He can't drink anymore. He's on guard. - Guard? - Do you wanna dance? - No, I do not want to dance. You're fucking up our plan. - Do you really want a man with a rifle pointed at you to get drunk? You know something, Larry? I think you're the craziest one in the room. Woo! Woo-woo! Woo-woo! (laughing) (uptempo jazz music) Woo-woo! - [Eugene] Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa! Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa! (laughing) (laughs) - When's the last time you had a woman, Larry? - Oh, shut the fuck up. - I mean, other than the missus. One you didn't have to pay for. Then from what I hear, she doesn't come cheap, either. - Would you like another dance? - No! - I wanna keep the party going. - You can't keep a party going. It either goes or it doesn't and this one is over. - Gene, turn off the music, please. - She's playing you for a fool, mister. She's waiting for you to hurt me 'cause she wants my fucking job. - Keep your perverted little theories to yourself, Larry. Just leave him out of it. He hasn't hurt anyone, has he? - He hasn't hurt anyone yet. - [Sally] Shut up! We wouldn't be in this mess if it weren't for you. It's your fault. - It's not my fault. He's the one that did it. - You fucked up while you were the boss, man. This all happened while you were the boss. - A million people a week work overtime. A billion come in on their days off and they don't flip out. - Why don't you just tell everyone how you got this job, Larry. - I wouldn't brag, Ms. Hot Pants. Burt Sandor, vice president. That ring a bell, huh? - I wouldn't put too much stock in office gossip, Larry. The line on your dear wife is that she does more than serve cocktails at company parties. - [Larry] What the fuck do you know about corporate management at the head office level, huh? - [Sally] Ever since you've got here, all you've done is parade around with your graphs and your charts. - Guys, you're out of your league. (phone rings) - [Greg] Yes, Eugene. - [Sally] Look at yourself, Larry. You're on your way down. - [Larry] Get that away from me, you fucker! I'll kill you! You bitch, I'll kill you! (gun fires) - [Greg] I want everyone on alert. - Stop it. - Eugene, will you answer me? - [Sydney] Keep him on the phone. - Fuck off. Eugene? Eugene? What the hell is going on in there? Eugene? Is anybody there? (Sally laughing) Eugene. - Sally, are you okay? - [Greg] Answer the phone, Eugene. Eugene, if you don't answer me, I'm gonna come in. - Mrs. Talmage, Marketing Analysis speaking. - Mrs. Talmage? - Robert, is that you? I don't feel very well. Could you come pick me up? - What the hell is going on there? Pick up the goddamn phone! Why isn't that machine on? Jesus Christ. (phone rings) - Yeah? - Eugene. What the hell's happening? - [Eugene] Oh, my gun just went off by accident. - Listen, I'm getting mighty sick of this choirboy routine of yours. You're playing a dangerous game, mister. Now, throw those weapons out the window before you or somebody gets killed. - The circle, Chief. It has to be completed. - What is this circle, Eugene? Why don't you come down here and explain it to me. - Hollow circles, empty circles, everywhere. - Listen, Eugene. Eugene, I know you think about a lot of things. You think about things that most people wouldn't even bother to think about. But I'll try, Eugene, if you give me a chance. - You are the real criminal in this office, Lawrence Gaylord. And you are going to be tried and convicted. Judge Eugene Brackin will preside and I will prosecute. (tense music) - [Greg] See anything? - [Officer] No, sir. The blinds are down. - All right. This is gonna be as easy as hunting ducks. - [Greg] Whose bright idea was this? - [Sydney] The mayor's placed me in charge. - Like hell. I decide. (helicopter whirring) (blinds rattling) - Ah! - I want that chopper out of here now. This is Smolen, you take your orders from me. Get 'em out of here now. - You're finished, Smolen. (grunting) - [Greg] Just beginning. (grunting) - [Sydney] You're fucking crazy. - [Greg] Maybe, but I decide when this ends. - [Joe] All right, fellas. Quit busting each other's balls. - You're making a big fucking mistake, Greg. - [Joe] Now, get that fucking chopper out of here. - [Sydney] Why'd you stick your fucking neck out for a nobody, a low-life, a blank? - Because. I want everybody down below. I'll shoot anybody that comes up here. Is that clear? - [Joe] Anything you say, Greg. - They're gone. You came to my rescue like a knight in shining armor. Come on. It's okay. - [Greg] Give me your weapon. Take a break, son. Forget this ever happened. Remember us, if at all. None is lost violent souls. - What's he up to? - But only as the hollow men. - I don't know. I wish the hell I did. I don't know. - The stuffed men. Eyes I dare not meet in dreams. - [Eugene] Round and round the prickly pear at five o'clock in the morning. Who's more lost, Chief? Me for trusting you, or you for trusting me? - [Steve] You are mollycoddling that asshole and it's getting you nowhere. The more time you give that person, the more dangerous he becomes. - He told me he wouldn't hurt anybody. (bottle thuds) - I hope you believe in blind justice, Larry. How do you plead? - It's not my fault you didn't get the promotion. It's not my fault you're not happy. Don't do this, Sally. (tense music) - Your Honor, lady of the jury. I submit to you that this is the real criminal. - That's insane. He's the kidnapper. - Shut up, pig, until you're spoken to! First, the charges. There is, of course, the charge of personal assault and sexual harassment against myself, but that's just the tip of the iceberg. - No, that's bullshit. - I submit that this man is a conniving, brown-nosing, shoe-licking, ass-kissing, spineless, dickless worm. He's the one that held us hostage with his goddamn quarterly reports. Admit it, slime. - Hey, you're the boss here. You make decisions now, not me. - You're a liar and a cheat. A pathetic schmuck who indiscriminately throws his weight around. And he wears cheap cologne. He deserves the full weight of the law, Your Honor. - She's crazy. I've done nothing wrong. - I need you to protect me. - She's lying! I didn't do it! - What would you like me to do? - The court has ruled in my favor. (bottle thuds) - You're fired. You're no longer an employee of Felton Power. - And the verdict is castration. (bottle thuds) - That's not funny, Sally. - I'm gonna cut your itty-bitty little balls off, Larry. Not that you have any. - Cut that out, Sally. - That's exactly what I intend to do. Now, where are those scissors? Where are those scissors? Joan, what are you doing? Joan, sit down. Joan. - Mr. Gaylord. - [Sally] Joan! Joan, stay away from him. - Mr. Gaylord. - Joan, what are you do-- (Joan retching) (laughing) - [Joan] Oh, God. I'm sorry. - Don't feel bad, Joaney. This is a much better punishment. You saved him, really. Come on. - [Joan] I'm sorry. Oh, God. (Joan sobbing) - You're okay. There. (tense music) Do you wanna lie down? - No. No, go away. (sobbing) - Better clean you up. - No, Gene. I'll take care of it. Stand back. (laughs) Come on, Gene. Gene, we gotta get you away. We've gotta get you out of here. Get you someplace safe where they'll leave you alone. - I don't wanna go anywhere without you. - You silly, sweet. I wouldn't have it any other way. We'll go away together. South America, how's that sound? Just think of it, Gene. Living in the sun, eating mangoes, listening to Latin rhythms all day long. No bosses, no time clocks. Not a care in the world. - They're gonna kill me. - They can't kill us, Gene. We're magical. - They wanna kill me very much. I know it. Even angels wanna take me. (subdued music) Eyes I dare not meet in dreams. (moaning) (people chattering) - He throws a wonderful party. - I don't see why I have to be nice to the jerk just because you work for him, Larry. Why can't you get promoted because you're good? - It doesn't hurt to cover our business assets. I'm not asking you to fuck him, just talk to him. Charm him. Be nice to him, make him your friend. - Okay, Larry, if you think it'll help. You know I'm so devoted to you. - Yes, honey, you are. - [Sally] Oh. (moaning) (sobbing) (groaning) - Chief Smolen? I wanna speak to you. You read me? Over. Greg? What the hell are you doing up there? I want you down here right now. That's an order. - [Greg] There will be time. There will be time to prepare a face to meet the faces that you meet. There will be time to murder and create. And time for all the works and days of hands. (sobbing) - Shh. - Oh, God. I feel terrible. Oh, my sides. I wanna go home. - And you can. But first you have to finish it. - Finish it? - You have to kill him. I would, but I'm all chained up. - I can't kill anybody. - You have to. Otherwise, we're not getting out of here alive. - [Joan] Oh. (screaming) - No, I've killed enough already. And I don't care if you fire me. I'm not gonna live a lie anymore. - [Larry] Can I ask you something? - Sure. - This hurts and I gotta go pee. (Joan sobbing) - I wanna see my husband. I wanna tell him the truth. - Of course you do. I'll talk to Gene. Just try and rest, okay? (sighs) You've got to set her free. - Soon. (door opens) - [Sally] How did you get unchained? - I'm not unchained. I'm just a little less chained. - Gene, this is no good. Gene, you can't let him roam loose like this. Chain him back up. He's dangerous, Gene. Chain him back up. You can't let him walk around like this, Gene. Chain him back up now. Gene, he's dangerous. Chain him back up. Gene, do it now. Gene? - How do you like being boss? Not a lot of fun, is it? - Larry, please. Just cool down. I can get us out of here. - You can? I'm impressed. - Don't make this any more difficult than it already is. - You know, Sally, with a little work you could be just like me. - No. - You've got moves, bitch. I've seen them. - Hey. I'm sorry about last night. It was wrong. Things just got out of hand. Where are the scissors, Larry? - Scissors? Where are the scissors, Sal? Where are those scissors? (ashtray thuds) Where are those scissors? Scissors. Where are the scissors? Now, where are those scissors? (whistling) Come on, scissors. Where are you? Scissors. (clattering) I don't know. - [Eugene] Larry, don't open them! They'll shoot you! - Where are the scissors? Where are the scissors? Where are they? - Code Red, Code Red. - Where are the scissors? - Larry! - I asked you to talk to him, not to fuck him. - Don't make me shoot you! (screaming) Larry! (gun fires) - [Greg] Party's over. (Sally screaming) - [Sally] No! Gene. (helicopter whirring) - No! - No! Get down, Gene! (gun firing) (Sally screaming) Get down! Gene, get down! Get down! You can still get away if you use me as a shield. - I promised not to hurt anybody. - You shot Larry to save me. It's the truth. You're loving, and honest, and kind. You don't have to die for this, Gene! No, Gene. - [Greg] What a fucking waste. - [Sally] No. (gun fires) No! (Sally screaming) (Sally sobbing) (tense music) No! - [Eugene] I don't usually do things that I don't usually do. And that's why this is so important, so right. It's not so bad, really. If I hadn't have done this, we wouldn't have gotten to know each other the way we have. Finally, I'd like to tell you that I love you. - [Greg] We are the hollow men, we are the stuffed men. Leaning together, headpiece filled with straw. Alas, our dried voices when we whisper together, are quiet and meaningless as wind in dry grass. A rats' feet over broken glass in our dry cellar. Shape without form, shade without color. Paralyzed force, gesture without motion. Those who have crossed with direct eyes to the deaths of the kingdom. Remember us, if at all. Not as lost, violent souls, but only as the hollow men. The stuffed men. Eyes I dare not meet in dreams. In death's dream kingdom, these do not appear. There the eyes are sunlight on a broken column. There is a tree swinging and voices are in the wind singing more distant and more solemn than a fading star. Let me be no nearer in death's dream kingdom. Let me also wear such deliberate disguises. Rat's coat, crowskin, crossed staves in a field behaving as the wind behaves, no nearer. Not that final meeting in the Twilight Kingdom. (tense music)
