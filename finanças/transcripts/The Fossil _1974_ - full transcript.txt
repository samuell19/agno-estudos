KASEKI ( The Fossil ) ITSUKI The man you see before you... is Tajihei Itsuki. In a single generation he's built up a construction firm employing... almost 1,000 employees. This is his story. Itsuki is leaving today on a two month trip to Europe. This will be more of a vacation than a business trip. He's being accompanied by a member of his staff he's rather fond of... a man called Funazu. Boss... your daughter's here. What's she doing? I expect she wants to see you off like this. Kinuko, is there something you want to say to me? No. No, that is... I think it's possible... that I'm expecting a baby. That's good news. You've seen the doctor? No... not yet. Take time off for a check up... and look after yourself properly. It would be nice to have a boy this time. What do you mean, this time? This is my first child! Aiko has a girl. I just meant it'd be nice if you had a boy. But, to be honest, I don't really want a child. You mustn't say that. If you have kids... the earlier the better. Maybe you're right. Well, bye. He felt alone. It was as if... he were all alone in the world. The thought had suddenly come into his mind... It was not only unexpected but took him aback as well. Since the death of his wife... He'd seen his two daughters marry... and gradually drift away. Now it was just him, on his own. We're really here at last! It's really Paris! France! What are you going on about? Well, it's your third time, but it's a first for me! So this is "Paris"! Itsuki had stayed here before... a unique, older hotel. It had a reputation... for it's relaxing atmosphere... and though not a large hotel, for it's high level of personal service. It was the opposite of an American style hotel. It was very distinctive. Itsuki's room was on the 3rd floor... or rather the 4th in Japanese terminology. It was a little bit dark... but the room had character. The window looked out... across the Rue de Rivoli and towards the Tuileries Garden. The last time he was here... he had seen children... playing happily in the Spring sunshine. Now it was urban: all wet and grey. The Paris winter had already begun. Boss, shouldn't I be with you? No, don't trouble yourself. If I want to go out, I will. I see. You seem rather tired. Four days in a hotel isn't like you. I've never seen you this knackered in Japan. I'm not 'knackered'. Excuse me, I said too much. Both your English and your French are quite good. But be careful what you say in Japanese. I'm sorry. I'll have you know I am not 'knackered', nor am I lying flat out in my room. I go for strolls regularly after you go out. By the way, where did you go today? I started by climbing the tower at the Place de Bastille... Height 52 metres, 238 steps. It was a hard climb! You're always going upwards, like smoke. Climbing a high place every day. First the Eiffel Tower, then the Sacr? Coeur. Yesterday, Notre Dame. I'm a complete novice! It's good to get a high vantage point and compare what you see with the map. Tomorrow I'll climb the Arc de Triomphe. Then I'll have done the "Five Best Sights". Wonderful isn't it! - Yes. This is real urban planning! You can appreciate it from a high vantage point. A lot of Japanese come here to see this... but don't appreciate what they're seeing. It's pathetic isn't it? It's not that they can't learn about it back in Tokyo either. From here you have a great view of the Champs-?lys?es. Shall we go down and walk along it? Sure. It's apparently an easy walk from the Arc de Triomphe. It's slightly downhill. The poet Villon was apparently imprisoned here. Quite a mansion... more like a city hall That's the 'Thinker', isn't it? (Rodin's statue) It's amazing Ishiki thought. He was impressed by Rodin... and felt completely overwhelmed. So this was how a sculptor viewed the human body. In creating these pieces... the sculptor... had represented the female body in multiple ways: it was amazing. Rodin... is a true sculptor. Although what does an amateur like me know. I just know these sculptures are the real thing. An architect knows architecture... and a banker knows banking. I'm no good for this. I have always worked in my own field, which was... stupidly simple. It wasn't for the money: I wanted to work. You've always done more than enough work. Not so. Actually I haven't. You have... everyone says so. You couldn't have done more! Everyone knows. That woman looks Japanese, doesn't she? Not like a tourist though. I wonder if she works for a Japanese company here. However you have to admit she looks rather elegant. How old d'you think she is? I'm not sure... Maybe mid twenties? Definitely more than that. From thirty... to maybe thirty-two. For a minute I thought she was going to talk to you. But she walked on. She really was quite pretty! A bit short maybe. Really? I thought she was rather tall. Perhaps you're right. A lone woman had walked past him. For a man like him to be talking about her... is peculiar when you think about it. But there was something about her that interested him. A few days later... Itsuki went in a car provided by another company... to Chartres to see the famous Cathedral. Because there were three other passengers... Funazu decided not to go. Yes? You're back already! How was it? - Beautiful! You should go. You've seen Notre Dame's stained glass, but it's nothing in comparison. Really? It must be great. I'll defiinitely go see it. Actually I just saw the woman from the other day. Which woman? Remember the woman who passed us near the Rodin museum? We talked about whether she was short or tall. Oh... Where was that? The park across the way. - When? Just now! I wanted to have a look at it. It's quite a good park. Have you been there, boss? No. You should go next time you're out for a walk. Well, what happened? She walked past me again. She must be married. At least I'm pretty sure. There was a child and someone who looked like a nanny just ahead of her. Maybe... her child I suspect. She's not at the age to be pushing a pram. She was out for a walk. She's probably still in the park. If the child walking up ahead really was hers... she was likely taking him out for some fresh air. Itsuki went to the park to have a look. If she was still in the park... when he got there... he'd try to meet her. Just as I thought. There's the kid. Let's go back. Aren't we better off going straight? - Let's go back. Oh... to the hotel...? No... let's keep walking. It must be nice to do that... What's that? Just what she was doing. Sitting and knitting while your child is playing nearby. Ahh... you mean the woman we just saw in the park? Yes. You seem quite impressed by her. I'd have to agree. But was she that pretty? A nice enough face I'll admit. It's not just that she was pretty, it was nice. The kind of women who sit and knit... are good. - Is that so? I've always found women in mourning dress beautiful, and in knitwear... isn't bad either. Wearing mourning dress... is how they try to purge the feelings they're feeling... That's what's good about it. You can see their intent. That's why they look smart and tense. But that woman isn't like that, judging from her face. Her face is blank. She just looks quiet, calm... determined. Isn't the grubbiness of a foreign country... depressing? - Yah. Boss...? What is it? Did something happened? That woman... you think she's happy...? or unhappy? Amazing, isn't it? Itsuki and Funazu... left on a ten day trip to Spain. From Madrid they went south by train to Granada. Seeing the Alhambra palace built by an Arab king... was something Itsuki had been looking forward to... ever since he'd planned the trip. The 170 kilometres between Granada and Cordoba... was a major olive growing region. Itsuki was delighted with it. The vast mosque... had been almost untouched by time. Everything else paled in comparison. However, it was among the quietest of European cities. The streets were a maze... and the whole town felt like it was frozen in time. There was an oldness in the atmosphere. Itsuki... facinated... spent two enjoyable days just walking with Funazu. Late on the evening of their second day in Seville... they went to an old bar. Funazu... was at a loss to help... he had never seen Itsuki so exhausted. His drive utterly spent... he was completely done in. So fragile... as if the slightest touch would knock him over. "Boss is exhausted," Funazu thought to himself. After their time in Spain, they returned to Paris. Itsuki slept for three days. He didn't have a fever. He was just extremely tired. Every day he would sleep 7 or 8 hours. All night I imagined Arabic patterns gleaming on the walls. When you're fully recovered we'll go to Berlin and London. If there's time once your Paris work is finished... we could see Rome if you'd like. The way our flights are booked, it's possible. That's probably best then. - Yes. Well then... set it up. After that, a couple of days rest... anywhere. Really... Actually the local office are preparing a get-together for you. They asked what dates would work best for you. Any preferences? - Whenever. You chose a date. It would be better after London or there may not be enough time. There's shopping and a few places to visit. Lots of little jobs. If you agree, let's deal with Berlin before going to London. When you say "deal with"... don't think it's just a simple formality. These are real people... They're making a sincere effort to do something for me. We mustn't undervalue them. Sorry. But I think your suggestions are basically right. So the local office today or tomorrow. I'll let them know. Boss... they're all waiting for you inside... let's go in. Oh... cigarettes? Mr. Itsuki... have you lost a little weight? Do you think so? Actually... I think you're right. All this additional business... means additional work. As far as clever come backs go... I can't compete with you. We thought you might prefer Japanese food. But the rice here is poor. Not to worry. I don't eat a lot but, I still enjoy looking at it. And just awhile ago... I saw a very beautiful Japanese woman. So I'm delighted you invited me. That must be Madame Marcelin. - Madame Marcelin? She's the wife of the famous and wealthy gentleman, Pierre Marcelin. There's some large party going on. I've seen lots of elegant women coming in. Is she well known then, this lady? Well, her husband's close to the top of Europe's 'rich and famous'. She's established herself as his legal wife. Not surprisingly, there are some who complain. But, I've spoken with her and she seems rather intelligent. She may well be. She was certainly clever enough to seduce Pierre Marcelin. Do you know her personally? - No. But it's unusual to get a chance to talk to her? She clams up when she sees you're Japanese. She's just being discrete. Except for Mr. Toyoshima, who was something of a fan... Madame Marcelin was generally thought to be stuck up. Both her personality and her background were criticised. But as far as he could tell... none of them really knew much about her. After dinner... they went to the bar for a cognac. Itsuki enjoyed a drink. He always drank whatever he wanted. However... this evening he really didn't feel like it. Rather unusual for him. What's up? It's not like you to abstain. Don't worry Yajima, I'm having some. Just the smell of it... made him faintly nauseous. Earlier he had been tired and slept heavily. He followed the conversation but from a distance. I'm not myself today! I'm just a little tired. He felt slightly nauseous and then... felt a slight pain somewhere in his lower belly. Itsuki wanted to escape to the toilet... but realised he couldn't stand up. He thought he might be able to force himself to stand... but was reluctant to risk it. So he stayed sitting, his body trying to defend itself. You don't look well. Yeah. I feel a little sick. Hopefully it'll pass. Were you like this when we left? No... only since the restaurant at the Ritz. Shall I call a doctor? It's not that bad. Where and what kind of pain? I had... some brief pain a while back... but it's gone now. Maybe it's something you ate? It started before I ate. The pain was in my lower belly. Like appendicitus... but they already removed my appendix. I think we should call a doctor. Do they make house-calls like they do in Japan? If I ask reception. I'm sure they'll find someone. It's too much bother. I'll be fine. I'll just stay like this for a bit. The pain in my belly isn't so bad when I'm sitting like this. No doctor... If the pain doesn't go... I'll see a doctor. Either way we should call a doctor! You're determined to call a doctor, aren't you. You have strange hobbies! It's not a hobby! It's just I think a doctor should check you. I really do. What makes you so sure? Why? It's hard to explain but... something doesn't seem right. Aren't you getting into what's not your business? Enough! How about seeing a doctor in the morning? It's not worth the bother. I'll book an appointment for tomorrow. That's good, eh? Did I say it was good? Stop fussing as if you were my wife! I just thought it would be good for you to see a doctor. That's why I said you have strange hobbies. Why? You've lost a bit of weight. That's hardly surprising, is it? I haven't had much to eat since we got to Paris. Not having proper rice and no sushi... that's the cause! I'm doing well to survive. You keep saying you're tired. That troubles me. Do I say it that much? - You do! You say it every day, and twice today! Are you counting? No, I'm not counting but... Well I am a bit tired. Only you who can do all this overseas stuff and not get tired. Anyway, if it'll make you happy... I'll see a doctor. But I'd like a woman. A woman doctor? A woman... and not too old. A young doctor. I understand... young and pretty, right. I didn't say pretty. Don't get cheeky! And slim rather than fat. Do your best... and if possible... someone like Madame Marcelin. See you tomorrow. Call me if you need anything. You don't need to tell me that! - Of course. Well then... good night. I won't be beaten... not by this illness. When Itsuki awoke next morning he was feeling cheerful. Last night he'd been so worried about his condition that he couldn't sleep. This was very unusual for him. Good morning! How are you feeling this morning? Don't treat me like I'm still sick. I feel fine in both mind and body. You do seem well. Yes, last night feels like a distant memory. We need to be at the doctor's at ten o'clock. It's all quite straightforward. I spoke with Yashima who knows someonew at the hospital. He set it up. Eh? You've already set it up? Yes, the doctor will see you at ten. Thank you, I suppose. But this morning... there's nothing wrong with me. No nausea, no pain, and I don't feel tired, and... I'm famished. It was the hunger that woke me up this morning. That's excellent news. But until you see the doctor you can't be certain. Even if I'm feeling fine? Well I've already set it up... Can't you just cancel it? Only Mr. Yashima went to a lot of trouble. You acted too quickly, as usual. - I'm sorry. Besides, you shouldn't have done anything before I got up! I'm not going to the doctor. But... What do you expect? There's nothing wrong with me. Don't waste the doctor's time. Don't worry about that. It's just a quick check up, and it'll be easy... The hospital's within walking distance. I don't want to walk. - Well of course we can go by car... What the hell is the place called? Toussaint Hospital. (All Saints' Hospital) It has a good reputation as a general hospital. But there's also the Hospital Hotel de Dieu... (General Hospital) Toussaint? I don't like the name! I doesn't sound quite right. But... Yashima knows a Japanese researcher who works there. Not a research student... But a senior doctor called Shirozaki doing research here. OK. I'll let him take a look at me. Actually he arranged for the head of surgery to see you. A surgeon? Yes... well, that is... Why a surgeon? Even if it's not a surgical issue, they can refer you to another department. What a strange hospital. But if I'm going to have a check up... I'd like it done at a good place. Isn't there somewhere better... like a university hospital in Japan? There is one medical university... but a general hospital here is as good as a 'university' hospital at home. Toussaint is just such a hospital. Oh, all right then. They can see me if you want. Good. So I just need to go to the hospital and ask for Shirozaki? I'll come with you. Unfortunately Dr. Shirozaki's at a conference in Berlin. Eh? He's not there? Apparently, he's away for four days. Let's wait until he gets back. Better to get it done now. Why? What are they looking for? There's nothing wrong with me. But that's not so. Don't say that. It's my body, so I should know! Listen to me when I tell you I'm fine! Boss...! - What? Please go today! I've made the arrangements. If we wait for Shirozaki to return, we'll be away again. Better to know for sure! What do you mean, "know for sure"? There's nothing to 'make sure' of! - I know but... What will it take with you? Still... let's just go to the hospital. You're trying to force me. But if I don't, it'll never happen. What did you say? You're out of line. That's right. You're implying that I do this all the time? Who do you think you are?! I don't damn well like it! Thank you so much for taking the trouble to come. How are you? What? Oh... I doubt there's anything really the matter with me. But Funazu here... keeps telling me I should see a doctor. Well, it never hurts to check. It's awful being ill away from home. If there's anything I can do? My boss told me to take care of you. Thank you very much. I'll let you know. But I hope I won't bother you again. It's probably nothing. - Let's go. Ahh... this is it. The first doctor to see Itsuki... shook his hand and then turned... preferring to speak directly to Kishi. Kishi then translated it for Itsuki. The message was that he should abandon his trip... and return home immediately... and seek a second opinion from the best hospital available. So there are several things? So it seems. That's why I hate check-ups. I hadn't seen a doctor in ten years. They're bound to find something if they look hard enough! Well, hopefully nothing too serious. I don't know how serious it is... but it doesn't seem to be life-threatening. Let's spend a week or so in Rome... before going home. Dr. Shirozaki might even be back before we leave... but it's unlikely. Judging from the doctor's attitude, it doesn't sound too serious. But it wouldn't hurt to get the doctor to send his report to Japan. It was time to prepare for Rome. Itsuki spent a couple of hours packing. With the changes to their plans... they also had to be ready to go home on their return. Tonight he was taking out to dinner... Yashima and Kishi who had been so helpful. So he needed to finish packing now. So... I'll leave the rest to you. I'll make sure we're both ready to go. Yes, that would be good. Hello? Mr. Itsuki...? This is Toussaint Hospital... The hotel switchboard said something he couldn't follow. Then a Japanese voice came on the line. It was Dr. Shirozaki from Toussaint Hospital calling him. Is that Funazu...? This is Shirozaki from Toussaint Hospital. I've just come back from Berlin and spoken with my colleague. Thank you. Listen, Mr. Funazu isn't it? That's right. Mistaken for Funazu... Itsuki should have identified himself... but he decided not to. He wanted to hear what the doctor would say... if he believed... that he was talking to a third party... and not to the patient. Did everything go alright? It's unfortunate that I had to be away. I'd like to thank you for all your help. I'm sorry to have troubled you. I had intended to call you. I'm sorry you had to call me. Not at all. As for the diagnosis... I should tell you the results. Yes please. What I'm going to tell you... is what my colleague just told me. I understand. So then... What's the situation? What's he suffering from? I'm afraid it's not very good news. This is not for the patient's ears... But I think you should know... what it is he's dealing with. I understand. To tell you the truth... it's likely intestinal cancer. Cancer... Intestinal cancer is only one of many different cancers. When you get to Tokyo... he should see a good specialist right away. Can it be operated on immediately? If this diagnosis is correct... it would need to be. The problem is... whether it's operable or not. And if it isn't... what are his options? Firstly... you should know, in this case the location is very difficult to treat. Actually... I'm going down South tonight... or I would have come to see you. I could have told you in more detail... and brought you the papers. Anyway... I'll stop by the hospital in the morning and pick them up. Could you do me a favour and leave them at reception for me? Of course. Could you give me a frank answer to one question? Yes. Is there any chance he'll recover? It's just that, since it happened on a business trip... I should really know. Does he have a big family? No. Two daughters... but they're both married. His wife died last year. He's on his own now. Completely alone. Only, I... - If this diagnosis is right... he's in a bad way. Around three years? Hmmm... Two then? - Well... So one year...? Well, I suppose so, if it's operable. Best you don't tell the patient. Right. I won't say anything. I'll leave the paperwork at reception for you. Thank you very much. I'll pick it up tomorrow. Boss! Funazu, is that you? - Yes. I feel like a cold's coming on. I think I'll go to bed early. You've got the dinner with Yashima and Kishi at six. Say I'm not feeling up to it. Apologise for me. Please go in my place. I'll tell Yashima you're under the weather. Are you running a fever? - Maybe a little. What about tomorrow's trip? Leave it as it is. I'll be fine after a good night's sleep. Please tell Yajima I'm really sorry. I will. See you later. I'll tell you about it when I get back. You can tell me tomorrow. Let me get a good night's sleep! If you're temperature goes up or anything let me know. I'll be back at 9. Take your time. It's your last night in Paris... don't rush back on my account. Okay. It felt like the bad news he'd heard from Shirozaki, was something... from the distant past rather than just yesterday. He felt like he'd come through a long, hard struggle of some years... and was now looking back and surveying it... as if from a distance. This detachment wasn't something he'd achieved himself. Just a meaningless respite that God gives all his poor, suffering creatures. It's Funazu. - Come. Good morning. How are you? Feeling much better... no fever. I'm not going to Rome. Cancel my reservations. You can still go. No need for you to stay with me. You've come to Europe... and so far only seen Paris. At least you should see Rome too. If you're back in a week or ten days that'll be fine. Then we'll go straight back to Tokyo. Go to Rome on my own? It's easy enough to postpone. You'll feel better after a day or two's rest. I don't want to go. Are you worried about what the doctor said? I think the doctor overstated it. I'm not going simply because I don't want to go. And I'm telling you to go because I think you should. Think about yourself for a change. You ought to go shouldn't you? - Yes. But... But what...? If you're worried... don't go! I'm just not sure about going alone. We came on this trip together. Next time I'll bring someone else. Never having been abroad, I thought you should see some foreign places. Okay. I'll go on my own. Is it okay to go for a whole week? A week, or ten days if you like. A week will be fine. Funazu said what he thought he should... but he clearly didn't fancy Italy on his own. Still, he was finally off the chain. Itsuki felt he owed Funazu for looking after him and wanted to repay him. This he thought could serve as repayment. And if he didn't act quickly... he mightn't have time. After sending Funazu off, Itsuki left the hotel... and went for a walk alone. Until now he had always been with Funazu, but now he was alone. Death and he walked through the city at the same pace. Now Itsuki was heading to Toussaint hospital to collect... the detailed medical report. Some papers? Dr. Shirozaki? Yes, of course. Thank you. (Merci.) He couldn't understand what was written in it... but to Itsuki... it looked very ominous. Even the livid purple colour of the ink unsettled and upset him. Just looking at it gave him a feeling of nausea. "Tumor" "Cancer: the crab." The next day and the day after... he stayed shut up in his room. There was no distinction between day and night. He woke and slept eratically. Itsukii even considered... committing suicide. But since he would die within a year anyway... there was no hurry for suicide. As he considered this... his thoughts about suicide... began to change. You...! You know who I am. You, as the angel of death? Why? You mean I look like her... isn't that it? Madame Marcelin, wasn't it? Why her? I am you. A version of you. Your companion self. Hello? Mr. Itsuki? Hello. Yes. This is Itsuki. It was from Kishi... but Itsuki didn't want to see anyone. He didn't want anyone to see him either. Hello. (In Japanese) - Good evening. (In French) Hello. (In French) - Good evening. (In Japanese) But Itsuki... had felt a growing closeness to this younger man, Kishi... for some time now. If you're ordering steak, they're can't be much wrong. Being ill... doesn't mean I have no appetite. - No, of course not. Until this morning I didn't feel like eating anything. At least now I have my appetite back. Well, that's good to hear. However... I'm still sick. It's almost as if you enjoy being sick. Enjoy...? Did it sound like that? Itsuki remembered... looking up the German word... and discovering it meant 'cancer'. The German word for cancer, 'krebs', could also mean 'crab'. There's a crab... eating my intestine. This piece of meat... is feeding the very crab that's devouring me from within. Mr. Itsuki? Mr. Itsuki... is ther something the matter? Err, well... It wasn't helpful to think that eating 'fed' the cancer. There was nothing he could do himself to remove it from his intestine. And therefore... in order to beat it... he had to eat and keep eating. To live a little longer... it was critical to eat. I don't think... it's a good idea to stay cooped up in the hotel until Funazu gets back. How about taking a trip out of Paris? This weekend my wife and I... are going to the Bourgogne region to see some Romanesque churches. Would you fancy joining us? To Bourgogne? Thank you. Will you come? Saturday you say... What are we now? Today's Wednesday... so three days from now. Two days after tomorrow. - Ah, that's right. I'm grateful, but I need to think about it... only just now... Then I'll call to check day after tomorrow. After that... he stopped staying cooped up in the hotel. Starting the next morning, Itsuki left the hotel every day around eight... and wandered the streets aimlessly. Paris was in the grip of winter. The more he wandered... the more he began to feel at ease. Gradually his mind relaxed. To a casual observer... he looked like any foreign tourist taking in the sights. But... not even for a moment did he find himself free... of the constant awareness of death. Like his very shadow... Death clung to him... matching his pace... following his every turn. I've often wondered what 'transmigration' meant... "the cycle of life, death and rebirth." It means that people are born and then die. You will be reborn... no matter how often you die. Isn't that it? Just that and nothing more? It's obvious, I suppose. The vanity of suffering. The vanity of vanities. Everything is vanity. Don't you remember? What about it? They're from a book... you read many years ago. You underlined them in red. You hated your father and your new mother. You ran away... though only a high school junior. It's from the Bible. I do remember it. "What profit hath a man of all his labour... "which he taketh under the sun?" "One generation passeth... another cometh..." "but the earth abideth for ever." "The sun ariseth... the sun goeth down... "and hasteth to his place where he arose." It was so unexpected. Words from his youth... almost forgotten... the knot of his memory, twisting, turning, and slipping undone... until the words were released flowing easisly out of his mouth. Itsuki thought about his dream of the previous night... and wondered who he'd been waiting for. Who was it... that he'd wanted to meet? Someone who made him truly glad to be alive. That, thought Itsuki, was the key to his dream. A friend who's more than just a friend. For a long time... you've been starved of that true kind of friendship. Work. Work. Work! From dawn to dusk only work! Was it worth it? I built roads and bridges and buildings. But... was it actually 'my work'? I did things if they were profitable... and not if they weren't. Is that sort of thing... what a man calls his work? "Tiny little beetle, so very rich... Filling up your store... coin after coin. "Liquid candy bought and kept... for your child." Poor little insect! Living until it got so cold. So cold... that it's all shrunken... and shivering. I found out... by chance how long I have left. There must be loads like me... who are living knowing their time is short. It'd probably have been better if you hadn't found out. Too late now. But... people are weak... and it would be hard to live knowing that. You're right. It is hard. Unbearably hard! However hard you try to smother the knowledge... how can you live with ordinary people... who don't even think about death. You have to have faith. Faith? Now... faith's all you have left. When I was young I read about the mysteries of religion. I was young and hadn't really thought about belief in anything. What are you telling me to believe in? Believing all life is suffering? What good's that? It's much quicker and easier to drink to dull the pain. Much faster! Drinking alcohol... does it really ease your suffering? That's ridiculous! I haven't believed in religion for years. How can I start praying now? You're still not ready are you? You can think you still have time... still one year. Still one more year. Do you really think one year will make a difference? Already it feels critical to you. It will get far worse. The next morning when Itsuki awoke it was after ten. As he had laid awake for two hours last night... he'd ended up oversleeping. His mind was unusually clear. He put his hand on his abdomen. It was the first time he had touched 'it' directly. He pressed where he thought his small intestine was. There was no pain. But somewhere in there... that crab was gnawing away. But this... didn't feel quite as horrible as it had yesterday. I can, as other people do... learn to live knowing their end is near. Hello? Mr. Itsuki? It's Kishi. I promised to call you yesterday but wasn't able to. Please excuse me. Not at all. How about it? Are you coming to see those churches? Ah! Romanesque churches wasn't it... Yes, I'd like that. Then we'll go. It'll be great. We'll leave around noon. That's fine. Great. See you later. Itsuki... felt like a passive participant... in the sense that his response to the invitation was uncomplicated. He'd never seen a Romanesque church. The problem of his death could be put to one side. So he thought... he'd go see these churches. Mr. Itsuki... Been waiting long? - Not very. Sorry, we'll have to wait a little longer. We're taking two cars, and my wife is a little late. Please... have a seat. Thanks for picking me up. I hope I haven't troubled you. Not at all... my wife's delighted you're coming. She's getting some food for the trip. I haven't met her yet. She's quite young, your wife? Yes. That was silly of me... of course she is. Won't you sit down too? No... I'll just have a look. What's she doing? She's always late. Making people wait is normal for her. In that respect she's become rather French. It's really not a problem. Please don't worry about it on my account. You're being very kind to take me along. I'm quite happy to wait as long as it takes. Still... I'm really sorry. I'm not just saying it, I really mean it. I'll take another look. You're late! But anyway... This is my wife. I'm sorry I got so late. Lovely to meet you. Any trouble caused is likely due to me. Shall we be off? - Can we wait a little more? Why? Actually... I wonder... She really said ten minutes? That means at least thirty. She's just has to arrange for the boy. You should have said before we left. There's no point saying that now! I guess I forgot... Forgetting's no excuse! - Big man, eh. Say it to her face then. I'm sorry. The other person coming had to nip home, but she'll be here soon. It always happens when you take a trip with women. We won't be safe until we've left Paris. They always forget something or need something. We've turned back for you often enough! It's embarrassing to say in front of my husband... but he has a neurotic need to go back and check that the doors are locked. Finally it's getting better. - Enough already. It's not good, if it's neurotic. Foreign places are certainly stressful. And men in stressful situations easily get caught in neuroses. Some husbands miss their wives if they leave the house... but this husband just has a phobia about unlocked doors. Sorry to have this exchange in public. Women are usually the cheeky ones. Women aren't so likely to get like that... while men tend to be that way in their first year abroad. Why's that? It's the language problem. Even those who speak it well, are bound to be on edge the first year. But if the women get neurotic, it's tough to cure. The only option is to send them back to Japan. She usually looks quite ill and always complains. Sometimes she'll even hate her husband. It can be like that. Even you had a touch of it. What's that...? I was never a touch neurotic?! I was not. It's a good idea to get away at least once a week... even if just for a night. - Really? For whom? That's why I suggested we tour these churches. What are you saying? It was my idea! - No it wasn't! It was...! At first you were against the idea. I had to persuade him to go. It's nice to see. When I listen to you two... it's really... really good... so light hearted. She'll be here soon. I'll check outside. Itsuki thought how good it was to go on trips as a couple. Long ago his late wife Yoshie... had wanted him to take a few days vacation with her. But Itsuki hadn't been too busy. They hadn't even taken a honeymoon trip. They hadn't even visited the nearby Atami hot springs. He'd always been too busy. But... had he really been that busy? He was busy... but... had he really been too busy to go for even one night? Itsuki tried to turn his thoughts away from his dead wife. In his current situation... it was painful to think of the woman who'd spent her life with him. She'd wanted to see the coast in Hokuriku. There and nowhere else. Just to see the Sea of Japan and just in Hokuriku. Why had she been so fixated on that particular area? For her... if she could have seen it once, she'd have been content... and could've died happy. How she must have longed to see it. She died young. How badly... she must have wanted to see it. We can't wait any more... so we'll go on ahead. My wife will follow later. I'm sorry to have made you wait. No... it's fine. Shall we have tea? You must be tired. Not really... I'm just the passenger... so I'm fine. But let's take a break. You must be tired. What do you think of the plains of Burgundy? It's nice. The Japanese equivalent would be the Kanto plain. But here the towns and cities are more spread out. It's good to be outside the city. The roads so far have been good... but tomorrow... we get deeper into Bourgogne and enter the really good bits. I see. They carved the faces of Burgundian farmers... to represent Mary and Christ. Romanesque churches have a Christ that looks like a local mayor... or a Mary like the wife of the hardest working man in the village. The plains of Burgundy run on and on from west to east... until they run into the Jura mountains. There's a place on the mountain road... commemorating the resistance fighters who died fighting against the Nazis... ...a grave for the youths and farmers. There's a statue of Marianne on the cliff as a memorial. Her hair streaming in the wind... she faces out to the valley... On the statue they carved: "Where I die, my country is reborn." (Ou je meurs, renait la Patrie.) It's from a poem written by Louis Aragon. "Where I die, my country is reborn." The young farmers are interred there. The Marianne who commemorates them... has the face of a farmer's daughter. Can we go there? It's not really possible. Next time you're in Paris, I'll take you. Hearing about it from you just now... has made me like these farming people and their land. It was only briefly... but I was a private in the army, fighting in South East Asia. There are lots of different ways people die. Some of illness... and some in the war. We were different. Not like these Burgundians, who fought to defend their villages... we took war into our neighbours' countries. The line: "Where we die, our country is reborn," was something we could never have said. However... many still died. We should probably all have died in that war. Even so... I'm still alive today. They've overtaken us. That was them. Was that your wife? - Yes. I can't beat her! That was pretty fast. - It's a good road car. Was your wife driving? I didn't get a good look... but I don't think it was her. But when a woman gets going... you can never say what she'll do. Those hills you can see in the distance... that's V?zelay. The settlement runs half way up the hill. On the top is the Basilica of St. Magdalene. The car's not here. They must've gone up. Let's go too. We should be able to catch the sunset. It's a great church. We'll have a proper look inside tomorrow. Let's go round back. That's where they'll be. There they are. Itsuki didn't follow Kishi... but headed instead for a spot slightly away from the two women. He'd greet them in a moment... but wanted to look out across the plain first. It was still light. but night was about to fall on the plain. As Itsuki stood there looking out at the view... an image formed in his mind, and continued to reverberate there. As he gazed at the gathering darkness... it merged with the image holding him... no, weighing on him... that was... the approaching darkness of his death. We got here first. Ah... you got well ahead of us. I should introduce you. This is... Madame Marcelin. This is Mr. Itsuki. Itsuki barely managed to contain the shock. It almost made him shout. He managed the introduction and a minimal formal reply. None of Itsuki's companions were aware of his inner turmoil. It was on the tip of his tongue to say, "I've already met you several times." Itsuki however, managed to suppress it. As you'd expect in a wine-growing region, wine is an inportant part of the cuisine. Yes. The say this wine doesn't travel well. It always seems to taste better here. They must be right. How do you find it? - Very fine. People have to make the effort to come here if they want to taste it. How about it? Why not get the villa around the back? Good idea, isn't it? Rather than a full 'chateau', a 'manoir' would be alright. What exactly... is a 'manoir'? They discussed the house by the Basilica, which was for sale. One reason that Madame Marcelin had come along with them... was to have a look at the house the Kishis had discovered last year. It would be good for the Marcelin family to have a house here. I wonder... It's a bit like a haunted house. A haunted house, you think? Don't you think so? If I bought it and you visited, we'd all be the ghosts. That house looks old enough for that. If Madame Marcelin won't buy it how about you, Mr. Itsuki? So I can become a ghost? I've never seen anything like this. Really... it's splendid, isn't it? It's amazing what you can create in stone. The most interesting carvings are in the middle. There are hundreds, so it's impossible to see them all. So let's look closely at one. Almost all the carvings represented... situations from medieval village life, and often in a humorous way. Or if not... they were tales of extreme evil. The lecherous and lustful... tried for their transgressions... were shown being punished in front of laughing demons. In contrast, the honest and hard-working, were shown as blessed. They were shown surrounded by children and a bountiful harvest... warmed by a bright sun. Has it worn you out? Is it because you've been looking so intently? Can I massage your shoulders? Eh...? It's no trouble. I'm fine. To ask you to do that... would be criminal. It's so quiet. Truly... it's amazing a place like this still exists. I suppose, if you go to the ancient temples in Nara or Kyoto... there are similar quiet places in Japan. Sadly... I've never seen them. I always felt I was too busy to go. I expect I will have... a huge log stuck down my throat by demons. "You were full of greed," they'll charge. He wondered, if when the car shot past yesterday,... Madame Marcelin was at the wheel? Though a bit difficult to imagine... she seemed like someone who could do just that. Itsuki went in Kishi's car as he had done yesterday. After looking around the church they drove for about an hour. They stopped in a small village to have some lunch. Kishi said he knew the restaurant. Shall we change places? I'll give you back your wife and Mr. Itsuki can come with me. Wouldn't it be nice to change? It would indeed. - Yes, I'd like that. I'll drive carefully. Please don't worry. - No, no... Thanks to this driving tour... I feel I'm getting to know these Romanesque churches. I'm so delighted you invited me along. Though I'm not from here, still I'm very pleased you're really enjoying Burgundy. It's about 30 Km to Autun. It's almost our last church. Yes... it's almost over. As at V?zelay, in Autun Itsuki saw a lot of carving. But toward the end, Madame Marcelin casually pointed out... a carving of Eve that she said she liked. Judging form her expression she seemed to be teasing him. But her cheerfulness reminded Itsuki of his unhappy younger years. He asked himself... why he hadn't enjoyed life and "picked the apple". Though V?zelay and Autun were wonderful... this is the calmest of them all. It is, isn't it? She's a very Burgundian Mary, isn't she? Yes, a very maternal one. Truly... a hard working Mary. Kishi seemed to say something... In the distance, it sounded like, "Let's move on to the next place." However... Itsuki wanted to stay... here in the comforting quietness that enveloped him. More... though he couldn't understand this keen longing... it was as if... he wanted to stay there forever. He found himself... in a building made completely of stone. The feeling welled up... that here was where he should be. This he knew beyond any doubt. Neither V?zelay nor Autun had made him feel like this. Surrounded entirely by ancient stone... with only a little light coming in through the deep windows... They shouted to him... the floor... even the pillars... the tremendous length of time that this old stone building... had stood here. Ah... to be here forever! Itsuki was overcome by it all. Truly, would I like to stay here? Did you say something? You just said... "to be here forever". What? Is that so? You said it, just as I was thinking it. I was such a surprise... that I responded. Is that so? There's a world of difference... in meaning though, isn't there? Between her saying it... and you saying it. Maybe so. You... You chose me, didn't you. Now that you're here... you know that death isn't something to fear. You've come to understand that? You mean that... this silence is death? Neither joy nor sorrow... no love... no hate... just... silence. Death... is when everything vanishes... into this cathedral, into this silence. Everything fades and disappears. You mean this building... was supposed to show those Burgundian peasants... that everything they knew was going to melt away to nothing. The Kishis must be waiting for us. Shall we go too? Thank you. Wooden shoes? Yes, I wonder if they're made from local wood. They're rather cute. I thought of buying them for somebody. - Maybe I should get some too? No... I don't think that's such a good idea. Why's that? They're called 'sabots' in French, "sabotage" comes from that. That's where the word comes from. So that's why, as head of the Kishi family, you don't like it. You can't run wearing those... so I'll get caught and made to do house work. - House work...?! They say we Japanese work too hard. So I'll buy some 'sabots' and slow myself down. Please order 3 pairs of clogs and 3 dolls for me. I don't mind which ones. Shall I choose them for you? I love choosing dolls. I would be very grateful. A present for your daughters? Ah... no. The Kishis chose his clogs... while the dolls were selected for him by Madame Marcelin. They were to be a reminder... of the last carefree trip of his life. Of all the things he had bought on this trip in Europe... these were definitely the most significant. I may be going to Japan with my husband next spring. Really... to Japan? I'd love to see Ina, more than anywere else. Where're you from? I'm from Tokyo. Though I've always lived in Tokyo... during the war I was sent to Ina. I took refuge there for a year. I was in the first year of elementary school. I used to wear a 'monpei'. (traditional girl's dress) Really... you wore a 'monpei'. Do you know the Ina area? No, I'm afraid not. Though I was living in Ina... there was a town nearby called Takato. The cherry blossoms there are famous and it's wonderful in spring. Flowers everywhere. You said it's called Takato? Do you think... we might see the cherry blossoms in Japan together? I'd be so pleased... if somehow we could. Excuse me... I suddenly had a rather strange thought. Earlier... standing by the river Saone... I was reminded of something in The Analects of Confucius... "Like the water in a river, everything flows without rest." It was long ago... As a junior in high school, he'd read a verse from Confucius. The Analects of Confucius - 9.17 "Human life is like the flow of a river... "endlessly it keeps flowing second after second, never stopping." It's done! This one last enjoyable trip is done. He'd been in Paris only three days ago. Only a short time had passed. However... to him it felt like a long, long time had passed. Everything was like a dream, rather than reality. Madame Marcelin's face... even the things she had said... however he tried, were beyond recall. All of it had become unreal. Just living out his limited remaining days... surely god would grant him a better end than that. Who is it? (French) Aah... Boss! How are you? The hotel said you'd gone to Burgundy. How was it? I enjoyed it. And your trip? Marvellous... thanks to you. I went all over Italy. I am relieved too. I was worried about you... but you look better, completely different. Really? Maybe it's you who've changed. Not at all. For being away so long... I'm truly indebted to you. Aren't you cold? No. If you are I can get a blanket. I'm not cold... warm in fact. Would you like a drink? If you like, order something for yourself. Right. In his half-sleep, Itsuki was thinking about the doctor. He remembered in the fog of jet lag, Funazu knew nothing of his cancer... or about the medical papers that the doctors had unwittingly given him. The letter of introduction to the hospital was there... and the diagnosis reporting that the cancer was inoperable. If it hadn't been for that... he would have unknowingly... lived out his remaining life in Japan proudly and confidently. That was no longer possible. Boss... We land at Haneda (Tokyo) in thirty minutes. You're not feeling well, are you? It's nothing. Right. I just wondered if I could do anything. I'm fine. Take care of your own things. Don't worry about me. Okay. Itsuki stayed lying in his own bed... enjoying waking up in his own bedroom. He was amazed that first morning just how well he'd slept. When he got up... it was ten o'clock. After all, people should sleep in their own bedroom. It's one's own sanctum. He would more than likely... end up dying in this room too. Better to breathe his last here than... in some hospital room. Yuko-chan! Good morning. You slept late. Did you get a good sleep? I slept very well. Your office called at nine, but I didn't want to wake you. They're already phoning. What time should I call the car? I'm not going in. I only got back yesterday. Last time you returned from Europe... you called a board of directors meeting the next day. We were all talking about it yesterday at the airport. Who's 'all' of you? People from work... Sakagami and Soyajima. Everyone there expected it. I won't be going in. So I suppose... could you phone work and let them know. Of course... I'll call now. Please... look after Reiko for me. Reiko dear... Mummy's just going for a minute. Wait for me! You're very quiet girl. She's a bit nervous. Are the chrysanthemums still blooming? - Well... Those are the last. Why? I thought I'd show them to Reiko. Perhaps... these would be the last... chrysanthemums he would ever see. He thought if he lived till next autiumn... how happy he'd be... to lie on a hill covered in chrysanthemums... in the cool breeze. You're strong and you'll live. In ten years you'll be ten. In twenty years you'll be an adult. He could imagine Reiko as she'd be at ten... but he couldn't imagine this Reiko at twenty. She didn't need to be as bright as a rose... But... he wanted her to blossom... as pure as a chrysanthemum. Father? There's a phone call. Say I'm tired and taking the day off. He's very insistent. It's someone called Horikawa. Horikawa? Oh that Horikawa. Okay then. Come on Reiko! What? Cancer? Probably. I'm not sure but it seems that's what they told his wife. They haven't told the patient. He doesn't know. Hello? Cancer... Sunami seemed so well. You've been so busy. It's been two years since you were last here. He overdid it... and then it was too late. Hello, hello? I'm listening. He's okay for the moment... but when I went to visit last time he talked about you all the time. Could you possibly come and see him? I'll come today, for sure. It doesn't have to be today. I took the day off and I'm at home... so it's perfect. Tomorrow who knows what might crop up. I'll be there today. Hello! Thank you for coming! I see you're up? Well, I get up as much as I can. How are you? I'm fighting the big one. The big one? It's cancer. No...! How can you know that? I managed to get the doctor to admit it. I knew there was something wrong... But I was busy and away on work a lot, so I let it go... and when I got tired, I tended to drink a lot. That wasn't very clever! I've been lazy since I was young... and now it's come back to bite me. I don't blame anyone. I doubt I've got more than a month at most. I was hoping to see you. I'm glad you came. But... you're so calm. You impress me. Of course, when they told me I was upset. Then it struck me that there was no point. Being good at giving up isn't a virtue in a businessman. Perhpas that's why I wasn't all that successful in business. You're different that way... you're tenacious! I'm not so sure about that. Is it okay... talking so much? It's fine. My wife just nipped out to the toilet... drank too much tea! I'm glad she's not here. I expect she doesn't know that what I've got is cancer. I wanted, at least once, to tell someone the truth. I'm really glad you came. I see. It's a real shame. I sincerely hope you live longer. Thank you for sparing the time to come and see me. I'll come again. - No, I wouldn't do that. Meeting you today and talking like this was enough. You really don't need to come again. Let's make this goodbye. I see. It's probably so... I will be busy from now on. Even if I intend to... perhaps I won't be able to find time to visit. As you say, let's say goodbye. Itsuki... there's nothing wrong with you is there? No. I'm glad. Live long and work hard! The man, sitting in the hospital bed... could just as easily be me and not Sunami. As he thought this... for the first time he felt compassion. But then why... when they shook hands... had Sunami said that about Itsuki. Had he seen something in Itsuki... that made him say it? Father, what are you doing? Nothing. Just thinking. This eveing, I thought we'd celebrate your return. Hiyo and I have arranged to be home early. This evening, eh? Ah... I'd rather not this evening. But... you're home tonight, aren't you? No, I'm going to the office this evening. Do it tomorrow. But Kyo-chan and the others are going home tomorrow. They can stay one more night. Just one day later shouldn't make much difference. Okay... I'll tell them shall I? That evening, he had to get out of the house. But to do so made him feel uncomfortable. Being in Paris... such things had been much easier. If he was going out anyway he could always visit Sunami again. As he left, the thought crossed his mind... but then he quicky suppressed it. Anyway... hadn't they already said their farewells? I'd like you to take me to the hospital again. Yes sir. Excuse me for not getting up. Of course... Last time, I felt I'd come away without really talking to you. Really? After you left... I felt something much the same. It's odd, isn't it! Thank for coming. I know we said our farewells... but I wanted to ask you about how you feel at this time. How I feel? Please ask... anything you want. Ask me anything you'd like to. Now I only say what I really think. I'm not sure you'll get the answer you're looking for. It's an odd question. Please don't be offended. Assuming you had a year left, a year of good health... what would you do? Well, let me see... I'd do good. Good? What about work? By work you mean the job? Yes. Work... Since I've been ill... work for me has become gradually more remote. How should I put it? The urge to involve myself in work has weakened. I wonder if all my life I've been wrong. Really. Of course you've got to work to live... but I didn't have to be so obsessed with it. There was no need for that. Well, at least now... that's what I've come to feel. I always believed that I was dogged by bad luck in business. But my lack of success in business... wasn't bad luck. It was really because my timing wasn't quite right. In other words... you're saying you lived your life the wrong way. That way... was a mistake? I should have lived differently. Let's just say that. So it was clearly a mistake? Definitely. Yes, it was. Definitely. Then, if you could have your time to live over again... what would you do? Well... that I can't say. If I had that one year you were talking about... I would do good. But if I had it all to do over... well... I don't know what I'd have done. I'd like to have lived a 'virtuous' life. Thinking more of others than I have. I wouldn't accept to trample on others in order to succeed. Money, money... always chasing after money. I wouldn't want to be always rushing around trying to get ahead. My whole life has been dictated by things... Money, reputation, well-being... None of them are worth that much! I would want to live a real life. But I wonder... what kind of life that really is. I don't know. If I knew what it was, I'd tell you. But I know it must exist! You must be tired. Let's leave it there. When you hear the birds singing, you say, "Ah, the birds are singing!" If you see flowers, you say, "Ah, look at those flowers!" ...that kind of life. Sunami... I'm tired. Sorry. That wasn't just Sunami he'd seen... but also himself... as he'd be a year from now. Visiting his old colleague... Itsuki had forgotten all about his position and their relative status. What Sunami had said... was exactly what Itsuki had begun to feel vaguely in Paris. But surely I'm not going to end up like that! Because i made work my whole life... business matters always took priority. I filled my days so completely with work... that I never had time to think about dying. The next day... Itsuki went to work. It'd been a while since he'd been in the office. Good morning. Boss, we're ready for the meeting. The agenda was varied... work decisions had to be taken. All of them were dependent on Itsuki being in good health. This thing called work invaded his body and mind. He found he couldn't remain unaffected. Two weeks after returning to Japan... he decided to visit his home town, Shinano. As he approched Shimano, the scene changed to a white snowscape. For Itsuki it was exactly as he remembered it. I'm glad to be home. It's good to have you back. You must be tired. What time did you leave Tokyo? At eight this morning. It took six hours. You look well, mother. Here you go. What time did you leave Tokyo? At eight. The trip took six hours. I see. Well then... Chiyoko's baby must be walking by now? Well, just about. That's good to hear. Welcome home. It's Yo-chan from Miyazawa. She's looking after me. That's very good. We're indebted to you. This morning, what time did you leave Tokyo? Eh? At eight o'clock. Is that so...? You must be tired. Chiyoko's still not pregnant is she? Actually she's had the baby. That's good. Yo-chan, haven't you given him tea? No worry... I'll do it. She asked the same thing over and over, didn't she. Yes. It's quite a shock. But... my Gran's exactly the same. Your mother's just a little worse. The hard part is...she doesn't realize the value of money has changed! She thinks 100 yen given years ago still equates to the same value now. Funeral offerings? Yes, exactly. As soon as she hears any bad news, she's off to give condolences. That must be tricky. But how can she remember it... how much she received? She has the old condolence book... She carries it everywhere she goes. I see. She keeps asking if one of my girls has had a baby... over and over again. Yes, I know. If it's a girl she keeps asking when she's going to get married. If a baby's due, she wants to know when. Getting married, having kids... And then funeral offerings. I see. You need to be careful. I'm fine! She's got good energy. At least that's a good thing. Your father was always so worried about dying and leaving me on my own. But here I am, carrying on just fine as usual. He must have given up worrying by now. Father really was worried about dying and leaving you alone. In that respect... I haven't been a very good son. Sitting here like this, I don't feel the wind... it's quite warm. Just as dinner time was approaching... his younger brother Taisuke turned up. Taisuke... practiced medicine in downtown Nagoya. They say medicine is the art of healing. Taisuke... put that principle into practice. It had been a year since Itsuki had last seen him. Hi, sorry I'm late. It's good of you to come. It's not easy getting away when you're a doctor. You said you weren't feeling well? How are you? I came home from my trip early. but it doesn't seem serious. You don't look ill... you look fine. Let me take a quick bath. Let's appreciate... some of our local sak?. Would you like some sak? first... before your bath? Bath before sak?! Bath before sak?! Mother... you already asked me. You have to try and remember that things that you've said. What a funny old head. You're right that it's funny. Since you're the doctor you should fix it. Don't say that... Some things can't be done... at least not by me! You're just very special. - Oh... of course! Listening to the two of them joking... Itsuki felt a warmth enter his heart. His brother Taisuke impressed him. This was the first time he'd seen his step-mother like this. At first, it must have been a shock for Taisuke as well. Unlike Itsuki... he had stayed at home... with their father and step-mother, and kept an eye on them. Taisuke had filled his elder brother's role, without ever once making a fuss. Come mother... sit with us. Never mind! Sit yourself down. If you're sure? Very well. Even though her mind was going... she never forgot to be considerate to her step-sons. Such a sweet step-mother... why then... had he hated and disliked her when he was young? Itsuki... thought sadly, that he couldn't recall... ever speaking kindly to or even smiling at her. When I was young I behaved badly. I also showed disrespect... to mother. It fills me with shame... to recall it. It's okay... Everyone's forgotten, haven't you mum? Forgotten what? My brother... He just apologised for being unkind to you... when he was young. Did he do things like that? He was usually kinder than you. So... did you think I was being horrible to you? I'm not sure... In any case, your older brother was the kinder. It's no joke... You've got to be kidding! When he ran away... you cried just over there. Don't you remember me consoling you. Did that really happen? When was that? You can't be serious! See how she is? It's so unfair! It seems you drew the winning number this time! So it seems. Though I don't feel that way. But still, it's good... this life of ours. For people to grow old naturally... is really good. Love and hate both disappear. Marriage, having children... and the condolence book. God must have planned it... to be like this... so people could reach their goal. Itsuki was moved by a sudden rush of emotion. A feeling so strong that he wanted to... let go and weep. You're getting old if you feel mum protected you! Are you asleep? No. I've been thinking... A guy should live to be at least as old as his father. But we might not be able to even if we try. But I think it's important that we try. Why? I'm not sure why... But recently, I've started to think that way. Perhaps because... as a doctor, I see a lot of death. Father lived in this house until he was 72. It's interesting... to wonder what he thought about before he died. In his last years... he probably pondered things more than we realised. A 72 year old has his own philosophy and wisdom I suppose. But I guess... unless we live as long as dad, we'll never know. Yeah. Children should live long enough to realise that, I guess. You being alive means father lives on in a way. And me... I'll try to live that long. In early February... Itsuki went to the funeral of Kota Sunami. It was a cold day. Boss... Welcome home. Oh, you're here! - I just missed you earlier. The funeral must have been cold. Reiko's crying. Nothing works! She's getting worse lately. We can't have that. Eh? I've got a bit of a cold... I'm off to bed. Ah... take a rest. Do you need a hand first? No need... you should see to Reiko. Isn't it a bit early for strict discipline? It wasn't that he didn't want to see Reiko. But the need to be on his own in his room proved stronger. "Have I become someone who only thinks about himself..." Itsuki heard himself thinking. I thought you were going straight to bed. I am. - Then do so. If you want to stay up, I'll warm the room. There's no need. I'll turn down your bed. It's fine. I can manage. Really father, hurry and get to bed. Okay! As each day passed... his dependence on others increased. He felt it keenly. The decision on his successor at the company had to be taken soon. But he couldn't do it without causing conjecture on the state of his health. That frightened him. Thank you... Sorry to bother you on your day off. I was just going to ask after you without bothering you. That's OK. Come in and have a chat. Thanks. Anything specific? - It's not about work as such. There's a message from Madame Marcelin in Paris. What did she say... Madame Marcelin? Remember Mr. Kishi... he was here this week and dropped by your office. And he said Madame Marcelin asked him to inform you... that she'll be coming to Japan at the beginning of April. And she wondered... if you'd like to visit Takato with her... to see the cherry blossoms. Who else did you tell? - Only you, of course. When Kishi was here... why didn't you tell me? You had only just returned and had taken leave to rest. I didn't think I should disturb you. I'm greatly indebted to him. We musn't do anything to offend him. Tell him I'll see him... at his convenience. He's already gone back. Gone back... to Paris? Yes. Aah... nothing to do. Apparently, every time she sees him Madame Marcelin tells Kishi... that the trip to Burgundy was wonderful. Until he had visited Shinano with Madame Marcelin... he was determined to stay healthy. Afterwards it wouldn't matter. This emotion... was much more intense than any he had ever felt... for any other woman. Itsuki couldn't have expressed it... but his longing bordered on... pleading, like a desparate prayer. I am very sorry. this is entirely my fault... I accept full responsibility. I don't know yet... what you've come to say. Actually, there are several things... What on earth has happened? This is... very difficult to say. Tell me all! I need to understand. I'm deeply sorry! The Kuzuryugawa project hasn't started work yet. Because of the heavy rain last autumn. Eh? Yes. - What's the key issue? The reports played it down. I took them at face value. They hid the early losses... planning to recoup them in the later stages of the project. How much? That is... 800 million yen. - 800 million! What...?! Hoy... tell me everything! It's all in here: The flooding at Fuzuryugawa had cost 800 million. Oustanding capital on the Nihonbashi project added another 350 million. And then... the banks were demanding 300 million in interest... on loans for equipment. These three things together... could easily bankrupt the company. It would be no surpise if the company failed tomorrow. You bloody idiots! The responsibility for this is... What? Now's not the time to posture about blame! In the morning at 8 o'clock... all the directors. BOARDROOM Now isn't the time to discuss how we got into this awful situation. How the hell do we get out of it?! Focus your comments clearly on that. You all know this... but remember... this must be kept absolutely secret. We'll start... with the situation of the Fuzuryugawa project. For all of this... I take full responsiblity! Don't give me that! We need to know at what stage the typhoon struck... and the exact extent... of the damage! Tell it all... hide nothing! Thank you. It was just a little dizziness. Nothing serious. Sorry to have worried you. So, back to the issue... It was critical... to acquire short term financing for daily operations. They had to survive this stage. Itsuki... knew he was making a life or death gamble. Boss... you're overdoing it. Shouldn't you rest...? I said I'm fine! - But... I'm not the kind of person to let this break me... not this. I can raise the money. - Oh, that's good. My land is worth 100 million... Cash deposits total 50 million. It's enough to avoid bankruptcy. But your own land... Without land and money, I'll be okay... maybe even relieved. Can't take it with me when I go! The company's biggest project was in Peru. Everything depended on it. It started early in March. Itsuki was determined it succeed... and put Funazu in charge of it. You've been overdoing it for a month now. You're still having dizzy spells. I'm still fine. Until the Peru project is sorted out I have to manage. I want to see if my gamble pays off... or if it's all for naught. While you've been busy with work... you've forgotten something even more important. For example... going with Madame Marcelin... to see the cherry blossoms at Takato. I haven't forgotten. You pitiable man... right to the bitter end. Alone, like a wounded animal. That's not so. I have at least one friend with whom I can talk honestly and openly.... or had. The person you were looking for... in your dreams in Paris? Shall I tell you? Tappei Yabuki. Of course! Tappei Yabuki! Of course. Boss...! Sorry, I'm fine! Why on earth had he forgotten about Tappei until now? In their army days, they had become close. They had an unspoken understanding that they would die together. How could he have forgotten? Itsuki? It's me! It's me, Tappei! Tappei! Tappei! - It's me! It's Tappei! The joy of meeting... was so great that Itsuki was speechless. Itsuki... in his excitement, forgot his intention to talk about... his impending death. I wanted you to see this marble. It's a bit unusual. It's all fossilised coral. Really. I like looking at fossils. Creatures from millions of years ago, going about their lives... little by little dying off, and then eventially preserved as fossils. Millions of years...! Counting in millions of years. Yes, with fossils, you tend to do that. When we were soldiers... we might well have ended up fossils. But we made it out alive. After that... it's all bonus! I suppose that's right. Yes, it is for sure. That we're talking here now... is a bonus. It really was a 'bonus'... this bonus of life. And he'd been distraught, just worrying about what to do. Compared with that incredible stretch of time... his life was so short it wouldn't even register. Itsuki's mind stopped... silenced by the thought of eternity. He was so glad he'd met Tappei again. He hadn't spoken of his personal situation... but being with Tappei... had eased the burden on his mind. We were so worried... when you didn't come straight home. Oh... I'm fine. I met an old friend. Never mind that, I need a bath. Sakagami and Funazu are waiting for you in there. Father... Please see a doctor! Don't worry. Honestly, I'm fine. It's my body and I know it best. All of us... your family and your colleagues are concerned. Father... You've seen sister's little Reiko... but you still haven't seen my baby. I'm very sorry to say it, but... we'd like you to have a check-up. Boss... After Paris, I was negligent in not following up on your test. Please listen to me... see a doctor. It's my body. How's it your responsibility? Don't be ridiculous! I'm tired. Let me sleep. Father... I will! You'll see the doctor then? That's what I said! Boss has what...?? Where's he gone? I don't know but... he left this. "I'm going away for a couple of days. Please don't worry." My sister wants to report him missing, but I thought I'd speak to you first. If he says a day or two... he'll certainly be back by then. There's no need to report him missing. However unlikely... what if...? Ah! I have an idea... I'll go find him. I've a hunch where he is. At the end of the war I remember your face. I remember... you... and the look on your face when you realised and said to me: "So you're still alive too then!" Since then the two of us have both lived long 'bonus' lives. However... my bonus life has almost no more time left to run. I haven't got very long left. And there's no one else I can tell. I feel a little sorry for myself. Isn't that normal, Tappei? In the end... please allow me to share this with you. Showing you the cherry blossoms here... will be a final gift to you. During the war... it must have been somewhere like this... that you girls would gather wearing your monpei. Yes. We used to run up the slope toward the trees, happily forgetting... the aching in our legs. Though I was very slight... I was right at the front with the others. I can imagine you... all aglow with excitement. That's right! I wanted to be the first to see the cherry blossoms! Boss...! Boss...! How are you feeling? Fine! Hungry...? I'll bring your food in a moment. So try to sit up, if you can. What time is it? Already nine. In the evening? Yes. When was I brought in? Dr. Kihara will come in the morning. Please don't worry. Until then... try and get some rest. The name Kihara was somehow familiar. In some meeting he'd been mentioned as an authority on cancer. Likely... since Paris... the cancer has had time to get bigger. Kihara will have discovered that. You had an examination in Toussaint Hospital in Paris, didn't you? They advised you to get a check up as soon as you got home, right? Didn't you receive something from Toussaint...? Like a diagnostic report for a Japanese hospital...? I can remember receiving it. Actually you see... your friend Mr. Tappei Yabuki... He and I are... known to each other. Not knowing you were a patient here... he called me the other day... about you. In Paris you were given some serious news. And you didn't reveal it to anyone, isn't that true? It's true. That's a terrible mistake... As a doctor I can tell you... you've misunderstood the operation. But... it's never succeeded in Japan. And in the rest of the world... it's succeeded only once. Besides... my case is inoperable. How do you know this? They would never have told this to the patient. Inadvertently... I read the letter to the Japanese hospital. So... and where is that letter? I tore it up. Clearly, you don't trust medicine. very much. It's a shame that you've avoided dealing with it this long. Though, I can understand why. I've dealt with a lot of patients, but your case is definitely a first! You think you know everything. You're the most difficult kind of patient! Father... I brought you some clothes. Ah, you're awake! Every day someone came to see him. They all seemed so nice. Each of them was kind to him and wished him well. But... he was unsure how to respond to such... heartfelt kindness. "Seeing myself like this, I realise I'm nothing special..." This realisation filled his heart. We've finished our examination. I also received your records from Paris. Their diagnosis and ours are, for the most part, in agreement. But... our conclusion differs from Toussaint's... We believe that your tumor is operable. Which means... we should operate as soon as possible. That'll be okay, no? Yes. "Do whatever the hell you like!" is what he thought. But he could hardly say that. Itsuki... knew that Kihara had been very keen to perform the surgery. Even so, it was fine by him. If it was useful for research... well and good. The day before the operation, Funazu came to visit him. Boss... I leave from Haneda airport tomorrow evening. Eh? I owe you a lot. The way I see it... as for yourself personally... you've always had good luck. You're luck is impressive! I doubt it's that simple! I can't rely on that. I believe... it will get you through this. Well, let's hope so. Maybe I do have good luck. I'm sure of it! Take care of yourself over there. I'll be fine. I very rarely get ill. Don't worry about incense for my funeral. You're biggest worry now is working with your bosses. Don't underestimate them. You have a tendency to do that a lot. When you try to flatter Waka... you can actually look as though... you're being rather calculating. Watch out for that. I will. Please boss... take care. I'll do my best to merit your confindence. Thank you. Then Kiyoko came in. So then... be strong! I will. You too. Eh? Have good children. How's it going? The pain has lessened, hasn't it? Ah... you're looking well. I don't really understand. They say it's a 'success'... what's that mean? Has my life expectancy improved? Exactly that. Improved... by how much? A month? Two months? A month or two more... I wouldn't call a 'success'. If you ask me how long... I'm not god, so I can't know for sure. As for the cancer being 'cured'... a doctor could only say that after five years completely symptom free. You've doubted my judgement ever since you arrived... but please believe me now. Sometimes it recurs... but sometimes it doesn't. I think you'll be okay. Live to be 80 or 90. I'm going to live? Yes you will. That's why we did the operation isn't it? With his recovering health... Itsuki's daily routine was already returning to normal. But... something was different. For example... the sympathy of his visitors. He felt... in their good wishes... a sincerity not noticed before. They were the usual phrases, but there was warmth and sincerity in them. However... the new Itsuki... hearing the normal sympathies from his visitors... felt confused and unsure of himself. Was it they who had changed? Or had he changed? It had to be one of them. What do you think? The change is in me, it would seem. Are you pleased you're going to live? I feel sorry. I've lived wrongly. Some people die too soon because of a mistake. I really feel sorry... that they should have to die like that. Is that why you handed the company over to Takagami? No. But... I just can't spend all my time on it any more, like I used to. In my long life... the time that we were together... I spent walking a very different path. After all that, I see everything differently. It was very high tension... our relationship... like when pack ice starts to crack. You see everything differently... but... it's over for us. After this I'll always be with you... But... only... you won't be able to see me any more. That letter from her. Shouldn't you read it. I know. But... the new changed me is afraid... that I can't handle it. Forgive my sudden letter... but I left Paris in March. I'm back on Japanese soil for the first time in a long while. I thought, at the earliest, it would be autumn before we arrived in Japan... but my husband's schedule suddenly changed. I'm delighted to see that Mr. Kishi has also... returned to the Tokyo office. So I hoped the same members could see the blooms at Takato together. Madame said, "the same members". But Itsuki knew that one was missing. His old companion, Death, was missing. And no matter what he did... that void could not be filled. Let's give these to a patient. You could open a florist shop with this! Well... this is a major move! Yes. We'll miss you but we won't detain you. Good bye! Good bye! It's good to see a patient walk out! Take care of yourself. Yuki... - Yes? Got a minute? - Yes. I need you to write something for me. - Yes. It''s quite straightforward. But... write it in a polite and elegant manner. - Yes. I am very heavily engaged in work issues. And will be... all year. I am very sad, that I won't be able to meet you. But from the bottom of my heart I wish you a very enjoyable visit. This needs to reach you soon, so please excuse me having... someone write it for me. Okay. I'll start now, Sir. Add one last thing. Please give my best regards to Mr. and Mrs. Kishi. Yes, Sir. I'll do it right away. Send it to this address. Everything in the past... has become fossilized... thought Itsuki. No longer... will I be able... to experience the intense mystery of that dark but pure flow of time. The Takato cherry blossoms... the River Sa?ne... the Romanesque Churches... Madame Marcelin... they had all become fossils in time. To remind himself that he was still a living person... Itsuki ordered himself some tea. With all the beautiful mermories now fossils in the past... and a new life which he hadn't... in the least expected... he was forced to consider how to best live this life. It had to be lived fully and truly. And now was the time to discover just how to do that. Subtitles rewritten and reworked: salmond. Translation help: Keiko MIMA. THE END
