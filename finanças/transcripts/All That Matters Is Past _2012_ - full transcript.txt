My God! -So this is where you were hiding? -And there comes the mother. Hi. -Hi. -Hi. -Want me to open the curtains? -Yes, please. We found the child again, hidden at a farm. Does that make any sense? Did he kill it? He? Who do you mean? Southern Norway has been through a warm spell... Now it's good, this placement. So when you have commercial breaks, you can watch it all here. That's good. It looks like ultrasound. My wife is pregnant. It looks like this. Refugees escaped from the reception center every week. As police, there isn't much we can do. Tell me if they make any trouble. I will find jobs for them all. He must have taken the baby from outside the reception center. How does it go again? Hi! What a lovely little foot. So pretty. Let's put on your little socks. There. So you don't get cold. Look how pretty you are now. So pretty. Come here. What do you want? So... We'll let you know. Thank you. He gave her the baby. And then told me where to find it. -Hi. -What did they say? I didn't report it. She became pregnant with William. Ruud! I have to borrow your car! Ruud! You have to let me borrow your car! Ruud, Janne is in labor. Lend me your car! She needs to get to the hospital! Ruud! They drove around for a few days. The two of them and the newborn boy. He checked into various motels. She was ill, and was feeling unwell. On the fourth day, she managed to escape from him. Are you all right? Are you all right? Later they lost that child. He could have killed her. Janne? -You realize we can't keep her? -Yes. -You do realize that? -I do. You're telling me you saw him and some Chinese woman. I read that in China they leave the baby girls in the forest. -Isn't that so? -We aren't in China now. Christ! Look at him. So the child was placed in the river near the cabin? Yes, she was. And you didn't bring her here because you don't have a baby seat? That's right. -And we know who did it. -Really? William's disturbed brother can do such things. I saw him down by the riverbank. I'd like to reconstruct that before we question you any further. Do that. For God's sake. You are aware that you're not allowed to leave town? Forget about that policewoman. She's an idiot. Do you want to go back to the city? No. I lay down on the beach, waited for the tsunami to return. But it never came. I was out shopping. I saw the wave on my way back. I stopped my car. Got out. All I heard was the sound. When I made it back to where I lived, everything was gone. A little girl used to live there. She wasn't that small. Ten, maybe. She used to stand in front of the mirror. Making faces, putting on makeup. She was the first one we found. Her body was all tangled up in the branches of a tree. Her head hung down like a little...nut. Later we found her parents. They were also dead. Just as well, probably. The strange thing over there, was how often I thought of Ruud. Through all that chaos. And the silence that followed. The rage in that wave. If it was rage. Made me think of him. Ruud. My big brother. -Is that why you came back? -No. I came back to be with you. Can't we just disappear? Look in the bag. He isn't gone. He's in the birds in the sky, and in the leaves on the trees. He is in everything you see here on earth. Put it on. Don't cry. It wasn't my fault. Hey... Hey, you... What are you thinking about? When you reported your child missing, you came with a man. Is he the one who locked you up? He is my friend. What happened after we returned the child to you? Where is he? Why did he not come back? Police came with her. Thank you. Now they want us to go back. Can I come for hiding too? I'll come back and pick up the rest. I have an extra car. Right. You three, go down there. You two, just sit down here, OK? Come. Put this on. You want girlfriend? I want to live in this room. It's not so dark. You can't go in there now. The nurse said you tried to commit suicide. What do you feel guilty about? They killed each other, didn't they? One with a stone, the other with a knife. Yes. Something like that. Thought you might want this. Hi. I brought you some food. Thank you. They say it will stay warm a few more weeks, but then it's over. We'll be long gone by then. Have you harvested your grain? I don't do that anymore. It doesn't pay. And what about that child? -The one you sent down the river. -She lives with me now. With her mother. So she's your girlfriend? The baby's mother? You're freezing. -No. -Come. -Let go of me! -Come, come. No! Stop! No! I'll bring more food tomorrow. And I can bring the baby too, if you want. It's warm now. -Please. -No, I can't. Please! No. Calm down. Help me. -So that's how I look inside. -Like any adult woman. It doesn't feel representative. Can I complain? I don't know what to think about her. About what she has experienced. Is she a murderer? Or a victim? Once she was nothing but a little girl. Subtitles: Nick Norris
