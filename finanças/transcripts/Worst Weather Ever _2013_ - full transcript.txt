Oh my God, oh my God. The world's weather is going wild. Oh man. Oh my God. From record floods in India to devastating drought in America. It was just a large boiling cloud of... dust. From deep freezes in Europe to scorching heat in Australia. Yeah. He's not looking too well really. The largest Atlantic hurricane on record... and the widest tornado ever known. It got so big, so wide. Even if you tried to flee, you wouldn't have been able to. Scientists are getting worried. It's the first time ever we ran out of letters in the alphabet to name our storms. Unprecedented. People were freezing. It was very unusual. But extreme weather has happened in the past. It was a dreadful terrible climate disaster. With camera phones, the internet and 24 hour news, are we simply seeing more wild weather more often? Or is the weather getting worse? And if it is, what could be the cause? In the last ten years, America has experienced its two most active tornado seasons on record. Yep, there goes the roof off the house. Is tornado alley becoming an even more dangerous place to live? Oh my gosh, look at that! Destruction. Holy crap. May 2013, two monster twisters terrorize Oklahoma. The nightmare begins on May 20th. A small tornado touches down in a field. This is freaking beautiful. It grows rapidly and moves towards Moore. A city of over 50,000. Storm chaser George Kourounis watches the tornado develop on his radar screen. And it looks horribly familiar. We couldn't believe what was going on, we saw this hook echo on the radar, debris ball, we knew that something very bad was happening in Moore. And we're thinking oh, no not again. How can this town possibly get hit one more time? Oh my God. In just 15 years, Moore's been hit four times. Yeah, here comes the debris, we'll get out of here. Hold on. I can't get my window up. Phil I can't get my window up! For those on the front line, it feels like tornadoes are getting worse. There's so much debris in the air. Fifteen minutes after it touches down, this monster tornado is already one and a half kilometers wide with wind speeds up to 320 kilometers per hour. It reaches the edge of town and plows through several neighborhoods. Alright... tearing up the buildings. It's coming but right at us. Oh my gosh that's violent. Then, it makes a turn and heads straight for Briarwood Elementary School. Jamie Maples is a teacher there. You could just hear it coming, like a jet plane was right over your head. It was just super, super loud. The tornado intensifies, until it's one of the most powerful twisters in America's history. The teachers and children take shelter. Calm down. We're in a brick building, it's ok. Finally the electricity went out and they realized that this was serious, um, so they started to get scared. There was a lot of crying and screaming. The next thing you knew the roof was gone. And then that's when everything started to fall. The walls started to fall and the teachers got trapped under some beams that fell. Keep your heads down. And then it finished, and then when it was over it started raining. Wow. Oh my God. Oh my God. Oh my God, oh my God. Oh my God. Amazingly, everyone survives. There were parents coming trying to find kids and kids screaming and kids crying. They all just needed to be hugged and told, you know, we made it. It was a miracle that we were able to give all the kids back to their parents that day. But the tornado's not finished yet. It strikes another elementary school one and a half kilometers away, killing seven children. In 40 minutes of carnage, the tornado takes a total of 24 lives. And destroys a town. It's on the ground, on the ground! there look it's on the ground, There, there it is, there it is, there it is. Dangerous tornado. Holy crap. But the 2013 tornado season has more horrors in store. Just over a week later, an even larger twister hits nearby El Reno, Oklahoma. Oh, it's a tornado. It's a tornado, power flashes. Again, storm chaser George Kourounis is close by. The tornado was so big it filled the entire windshield. It wasn't pretty in any way. It was a dark mean smear, a smudge across the horizon that just looked like it meant business. That was a powerful tornado. The wind speed reaches a terrifying 475 kilometers per hour. Among the fastest ever recorded. Strong tornado. And even more surprising is its size. The tornado is rapidly getting bigger. Uh, to our east, 200 yards to our east. The twister quickly grows from one and a half to over four kilometers across. Large enough to stretch from one end of New York's Central Park to the other. Holy shit. Go man, go. Hit the gas. It plows across interstate 40. Eight people are killed in their cars, including three experienced storm chasers. It was the first time that any storm chaser has ever been killed by the storm they've been chasing. It got so big, it got so wide so fast. Even if you tried to flee, you wouldn't have been able to. This is the widest tornado on record anywhere in the world. And other remarkable tornadoes are appearing around the globe. In Portugal, a raging vortex tears apart a stadium. And in Bangladesh, a violent twister takes 23 lives as it rips through hundreds of houses. Is this just a coincidence? Or are tornadoes taking a turn for the worse? Look how big that thing is! To find out, meteorologists like Josh Whurman investigate how powerful they were in the past. The tornado which killed the most people was way back in 1925, called the tri-state tornado. America's deadliest tornado leaves the longest trail of destruction ever known - carving a path through three states. And kills nearly 700. The deadliest tornado in history strikes Bangladesh in 1989. Killing around 1300. But death tolls aren't an accurate measure of a tornado's power. Comparing violent tornadoes from different decades is very, very difficult. The average number of deaths has been going down. We think that's because people are more aware of tornadoes, because we have better warnings and better education. So it's very hard to compare tornadoes from past decades to new ones. Death tolls are falling. But the number of reported tornadoes is rising. Records indicate there have been more than three times as many tornadoes over the last decade than in the fifties. But even this is not as clear cut as it seems. In the past, fewer people were looking for tornadoes. When I started 15 years ago, there were very few storm chasers, not very many at all, and everybody knew everybody else. Oh there it is, it's right there, quick that large tornado right there. But now, anyone with a cheap camera can be a storm chaser. ...I got amazing video. Now, there are more people out there. And there are times when you're in the middle of nowhere, on some rural country road and there's traffic jams with storm chasers. This is a bad situation here. We've got large tornado coming behind us and everybody's stuck on this road right now. And the more we look, the more we find. There it is. Oh we're in perfect position. Hahaha... Most tornadoes simply touch down in a field. In the past, this tornado might have passed by unseen. These days, it becomes another statistic. So of course there's going to be more of these tornadoes reported. Are there actually more of them happening? We're not so sure yet. Bu what experts do know is that the atmospheric conditions that cause tornadoes are changing. They know, because of millions of precise measurements painstakingly collected over the last hundred years. Twice a day, every day, weather balloons all over the world take the atmosphere's temperature. They're part of a vast network monitoring the weather. Peter Stott is head of climate monitoring at the Met Office in England. We have measurements of temperatures from many, many thousands of weather stations over the land. And we also have measurements uh, of sea surface temperatures. And we're also increasingly using satellite data as well. And what the data reveals is shocking. Over the last century, the world has heated up by just under one degree Celsius on average. This is global warming. So we have very clear evidence that the world has warmed. And with that has come many other changes in weather as well. The extra heat is transforming the atmosphere. In the skies above us, the weather is changing. But is it getting worse? Climatologist Scott Denning is one of thousands of scientists trying to figure out exactly how higher temperatures affect the weather. The climate system is driven by heat coming in from the sun, and by heat streaming back out into space. And the more heat you put into the system, the, the faster it runs, the harder it runs. It changes all kinds of things. It changes temperature, it changes rainfall, it changes clouds. The system is a system, it's linked. But when it comes to tornadoes, it's... complicated. Check it out. In order to get a strong tornado from a supercell thunderstorm we need two ingredients. One is energy, warm moist air to get the thunderstorm going in the first place. But that's not enough, we also need rotation, which is differences in wind speeds at different levels in the atmosphere, to make that thunderstorm spin. We need both of those in order to have a rotating supercell thunderstorm that can make a violent tornado. As the world warms, these two factors change in different ways. More heat could mean bigger thunderstorms. But at the same time, high altitude winds could be changing, which may cause less rotation in the atmosphere. We don't know whether we're getting more tornadoes, stronger tornadoes or whether there are any changes in where the tornadoes are occurring. With global warming, we might have more thunderstorms in tornado alley, but they might rotate and make tornadoes less frequently. We're just gonna have to wait until we get several years of data to even out the spikes that we see year to year. Tornadoes may get smaller and rarer. Or climate change could create the conditions for a new breed of super twister, making the monster that struck Moore a sign of things to come. While the jury is still out on tornadoes, if thunderstorms intensify as predicted, other extreme weather phenomena could get worse: Including hail. Oh man. And it's not just car windshields that can take a battering. Hail can ravage vast areas of crops. Every year, it inflicts over a billion dollars' worth of damage in America alone. ...very large hail... Holly... It can even be deadly. Oh my God, oh my God dude. My truck is getting hammered. This is ridiculous. In 2010, the world's largest recorded hailstone falls in South Dakota, America. With a circumference of over 46 centimeters, it's as big as a large grapefruit. The last decade has seen a torrent of fatal hailstorms. Southern China, March 2013. Severe thunderstorms spawn giant lumps of ice. Catching residents unaware. They destroy homes and vehicles. And kill more than twenty people. The next month, a freak hailstorm kills three people in Afghanistan. Could these killer hailstones be a new phenomenon? Deep in the Himalayas is a clue. Around the shores of a crater lake hides a nightmarish scene. Hundreds of skeletons. Men, women and children. Who, or what, killed them, is a mystery. A National Geographic expedition sets out to investigate. As soon as we got up close we could see that the whole landscape there was littered with bones and skulls and pieces of flesh. You could hardly take two steps without stepping on a piece of flesh or a bone or a skull or something. For most of the last 50 years or so, I think most scientists have assumed that they died in some kind of a landslide or avalanche. Bone samples reveal these people lived, and died, over a thousand years ago. The group was traversing the mountains, when the unexplained disaster struck. It's very clear that they didn't die of any disease. They were not murdered, they didn't kill themselves or die in a landslide. Then, on closer inspection, many of the skulls reveal an even more horrifying demise. Death from powerful blows to the head by a blunt object. What the bones reveal is the fractures of the skull that could have killed them. That incident must have occurred at the time of death. It's a complete mystery. Until investigators hear a local folk song... a legend about ice falling from the sky. The song helps the experts reach a shocking conclusion: With nowhere to hide, the travelers were brutally struck down by giant hail. Hailstones big enough to kill seem to have been around for centuries... But could they get even bigger? To find out, meteorologist Kelly Mahoney has come to an indoor sky diving center. Its vertical wind tunnel can simulate the conditions at the heart of a storm, where hail is made. We're standing here inside an indoor sky diving wind tunnel, trying to feel what it would be like inside a thunderstorm. Just like this chamber, thunderstorms contain powerful vertical winds that blow upwards called updrafts. A 100 kilometer per hour updraft can support tennis balls. So hailstones form when a piece of ice starts to collect water. It gets tossed around enough like these balls are. Starts to collect supercooled water and it grows and it grows until it becomes damaging. Like these tennis balls would certainly be if they were to fall to the ground. As soon as hailstones grow any heavier, they fall from the sky. So in a storm like this, you won't find any hail heavier than a tennis ball. Once you start to grow bigger and bigger hailstones you need stronger and stronger updrafts. This grapefruit sized hailstone doesn't stand a chance in just 60 miles per hour. For grapefruits, you need wind speeds of almost 200 kilometers per hour. Storms with updrafts this powerful are very rare, but that could change. So as the global temperature and moisture increases, we like to think we'll have a lot more energy to fuel thunderstorms. So if all other things are equal, and you pump up updrafts, like what's holding up these grapefruits behind us, you can grow more damaging hailstones potentially and face a lot more damage. But storms have an even deadlier weapon in their arsenal. Lightning. If the climate changes, we would expect that there would be changes in how much lightning we get. If we get more deep thunderstorms, then we expect more lightning strikes. Yet paradoxically in some places the number of lightning deaths is falling. In Japan, Europe, North America and Australia, lightning killed ten times more people in the 1800s, than today. It might seem that lightning is striking less often, but there may be another reason for this decline. People are living more urban lifestyles and people are getting warnings of thunderstorms, or people have access to shelter more easily. So the chance that I'm gonna be out here when a big lightning strike happens, is pretty low. As a result, there are fewer deaths from lightning today in the developed world. But that doesn't mean lightning is striking less often. In other more remote parts of the world, lightning is still a major killer. Taking 24,000 lives across the world every year. The most dangerous place to be is in Central Africa. With thunderstorms all year round, this is the lightning capital of the world. In 2011, a colossal storm forms over Uganda. People run to take shelter. But for one school class, that isn't enough. A single powerful bolt strikes their classroom and kills 19 children. It's a terrible demonstration of lightning's power. And if rising global temperatures trigger more lightning, there could be even more tragedies like this. The best way to find out if lightning is increasing, is to count the bolts. Oh! Fuck yea! Every second there are around 100 lightning strikes somewhere in the world. Some are powerful enough to light a hundred million light bulbs. So they can be easily detected by satellites. It's hard to get measurements everywhere over the tropical jungles, unless we just fly over them from way up in space. And we can see the lightning, we can see the light it gives off, we can see radio signals it gives off and basically count up the thousands of lightning strikes that happen across the globe every day. Satellites record the number of lightning strikes during cold years and warm years. And they found that hot years have more lightning. Even small changes in temperature can cause more and deeper thunderstorms which make very much more lightning. So if the planet continues to warm up as expected scientists think that by the end of the century, we could see hundreds of millions more lightning strikes per year. And with many of these in tropical lightning hotspots, they're likely to be more deadly. We have concern that in more remote areas of the world, particularly farming areas of the world, where that shelter isn't available or that warnings aren't available, that increased lightning could result in more direct lightning deaths. With global temperatures rising, experts predict thunderstorms will intensify, unleashing more hail and lightning in many parts of the world. Such as America's North East. By the late 21st century, it could face more intense storms than ever witnessed before. With extreme hail, lightning and winds, life for over 50 million people could be changed forever. A small shift in temperature can have a massive effect on storms and the extreme weather they produce. But this extra heat has a more direct impact on our lives. Over the last decade, high temperature records have been shattered around the world, from Las Vegas... I've got here an egg and a saucepan which has been heating up the whole day in the sun. We'll see what happens. Literally just ten minutes later, and it's, it's actually perfectly cooked. To Siberia. Inspiring some creative solutions to keeping cool. In 2013, Australia endures a heat wave of epic proportions, lasting over two weeks. So even though we call it ice cream for dogs, it's actually yogurt. Yummy. The Bureau of Meteorology has to redraw their weather charts to illustrate the unprecedented temperatures. Nick Klingaman is an expert on Australia's climate. They had to add a new color onto the maps that they produce for the maximum temperatures in Australia every day. I think the highest it went was 52 Celsius and uh, it was projected to be above that. So it was extraordinary levels of heat that we saw in Australia this, this summer. 2012 is America's hottest year ever known. 2010 brings Russia's hottest summer on record. And in 2003, a mega heat wave smashes records across Europe. Killing tens of thousands. There has been record breaking weather in the past. In 1976 much of Europe swelters through its hottest summer since records had begun. And back in 1933, America's warmest June ever known. But in the past, there were just as many new records set for the coldest days, as there were for the hottest ones. So over time, temperatures balanced out. Now there are far more hot records set than cold. Climate expert Radley Horton studies heat waves. If we look at the period from 2000 to 2009, in the US there were twice as many extreme heat events as there were extreme cold events. So we're seeing more records getting broken on the heat side than on the cold side. The evidence is indisputable. The world is getting hotter. The question, is why? Professor Scott Denning is trying to find the answer, by using data from a network of super-tall towers that collect gases from high in the atmosphere. This tower is about uh, 300 meters high, almost a thousand feet. And there are these plastic tubes that you can see here that uh, run all the way up the tower, they're collecting air, simply, uh, through inlets. The air is diverted to an instrument at the bottom of the tower, which precisely measures carbon dioxide levels. These measurements show that just recently the carbon dioxide has reached 400 parts per million, 400 molecules of carbon dioxide per million molecules of air a higher level than the carbon dioxide has been for millions of years. Most of this extra carbon dioxide comes from the burning of coal, oil and gas to power our homes, vehicles and cities. And now it's heating the planet. Carbon dioxide is a greenhouse gas, which means that it absorbs heat radiation from the earth. As the heat radiation is trapped by these molecules, it can then get re-emitted. And the part that gets re-emitted downward will actually warm the surface. So, carbon dioxide emits heat, heat warms things up, so if we add a lot of carbon dioxide molecules to the atmosphere, it'll warm the surface of the earth. Greenhouse gases like carbon dioxide act like a giant invisible blanket, holding in the warmth. Because of this, over the last century the world has got just under one degree Celsius warmer. That is why we're seeing more extreme heat waves, more often. As well as causing deadly temperatures, heat waves may also cause catastrophic effects in the countryside. Oh my God, I gotta get out of here. All the way down the hill, dude, look at this. We gotta go! Experts are investigating whether extreme heat is linked to more wildfires. I've never seen anything like this. I can't stop shaking. Look at that. All those homes. Over the last few years, they've collected valuable evidence from some of America's most destructive fires ever. June 2013. A fire breaks out in Black Forest, Colorado. Daphne Knight and Ryan Butler are on their way to work when they see smoke. On the day it started, everything was fine, everything was green, you just barely saw a little plume of smoke off to the side there. Really we didn't think it was going to be that big, we were just going up this road and filming the smoke. Holy shit, that looks like a damn explosion cloud, ya know? Fanned by high winds, the fire spreads rapidly through the hot, dry undergrowth. Before fire-fighters can control the blaze, it reaches a homestead. I'm pretty sure it was the houses burning that, it just created this big black plume of smoke. And it went from day to night for a good couple of hundred yards maybe. Oh, we're in it. The fire burns out of control... tearing through whole neighborhoods. Within two days, it's already the most destructive in Colorado's history. Nearly 40,000 people are evacuated... as well as hundreds of animals. As they try to escape, two residents burn to death in their garage. That's where those people lived. Aw, jeeze. The ones that died. That's the house? That's where the people lived that died? They had come home to get their belongings 'cause they had heard about the fire, and that was it, they didn't have time to get out It was in their own driveway. In the garage they were packing up their stuff. Yeah, they didn't make it. There's another one of these cars that just is completely burnt out. After a week and a half, the fire is finally contained. Over 500 houses have been destroyed. I think I'm still in a state of shock. A lot of my friends' homes, all they are is uh, just chimneys now. Colorado's three most destructive wildfires have all burned in the last two years. Both years also had record-breaking heat waves. Climate scientist Jeff Lukas is investigating the link between the two. He's searching for answers inside trees. They contain a record of every forest fire over their lifetime. This cross-section here is from a Ponderosa Pine. And during its lifetime, uh, fire was a frequent visitor to that forest, and the tree experienced and recorded through scarring eight separate wildfires, uh, each of which we can precisely date uh, to the exact year. Tree rings also tell him whether each year was hot and dry or cold and wet. He finds that the hottest, driest years all coincide with the most wildfires. Throughout history, heat and wildfires go hand in hand. Even though each of these eight years was warmer than the average, uh, none of these eight years is as warm as the last few decades we've experienced. Particularly the last decade, which has been the warmest in the uh, instrumental record of over a hundred years in Colorado. Making the region's forests more vulnerable than ever. Every degree of warming will tend to dry out the soils; will dry out vegetation; will dry dead fuels and make fires more likely, make their spread more severe and make their impacts more severe. Higher temperatures are already taking their toll, around the world. In Australia the record-breaking hot summer of 2012 to 2013, sets off devastating wildfires. This thirsty koala is caught up in the blaze. He's not looking too well, really. Russia's hottest summer on record also triggers hundreds of wildfires across the country. Thousands flee from burning villages. These men escape the inferno. 54 others were not so lucky. Hotter, drier conditions are causing more wildfires. As the climate changes, experts predict more forest fires in the years and decades ahead. Unfortunately I think we can expect that the fires we've been experiencing in the last three years to be a harbinger of the future. Research suggests that by 2050, in some areas, wildfires could be five times more destructive than today. As temperatures rise and the land heats up and dries, more forests will burn. But as the sea warms up, something truly terrifying could be unleashed. The biggest, most destructive storms on the planet, hurricanes. At their worst, they can generate winds of over 300 kilometers per hour across a vast region hundreds of kilometers wide. Every single raindrop feels like someone hitting you with a needle. Every piece of gravel feels like a bullet, pieces of metal will fly around like helicopter blades. You just can't be out in it, it's like being in a blender for hours and hours and hours. Hurricanes, also called typhoons and cyclones, form and grow over oceans, feeding off warm water. Which is why many scientists fear warmer seas could already be making these monster storms even more destructive. There's pretty good reason to believe that stronger hurricanes will be more frequent with global warming. That's mainly because the source of energy for hurricanes primarily is very warm ocean conditions. But we still need to learn some important things about how hurricanes intensify, how they extract their energy from the ocean. And we can only do that by getting right up close to the surface and watching what happens in the winds in the eye wall. October 2012, a swirling mass of air is gathering high above the warm waters off the Nicaraguan coast. A killer is born. This is Tropical Storm Sandy. In its eight day life, Sandy will kill people in eight countries, and cause over 60 billion dollars' worth of damage. Wow. At two days old, Sandy becomes a full-blown hurricane raging across the Caribbean Raging across the Caribbean with nine meter high waves and nearly 200 kilometers per hour winds killing at least 70 people. Sandy moves north, passing over an unusually warm stretch of water, swelling into a superstorm. A monster hurricane, over 1,500 kilometers across. It then takes a sharp left turn, directly toward America's most densely populated coastline. All of us across the country are concerned about the potential impact of Hurricane Sandy. Uh, this is a serious and big storm. Sixty million people brace for the superstorm about to make landfall in New Jersey. Climatologist Heidi Cullen can hardly believe its size. This was an enormous storm. We're talking 900 miles wide, roughly 1500 kilometers wide, which means that when it made landfall, it stretched across an enormous swathe of the country. October 29th. The largest Atlantic hurricane in history makes landfall in America. Wow! Storm chaser George Kourounis is on Rockaway boardwalk in New York to witness the extraordinary event. As the storm was intensifying it became very clear to us that this was no ordinary hurricane, this was gonna be really, really bad. There was a mountain of waves that was just being held there by the wind. And then eventually it changed direction, and all that water came flying in, taking all the sand with it, totally destroying this neighborhood. New York has weathered hurricanes before, but never this big... or with such a high storm surge. The sea level rises up four meters, nearly a meter higher than ever before. The surf was as violent as I've ever seen in seventeen hurricanes that I've been in. All the pieces of the boardwalk got completely ripped up by the waves, dragged inland, I don't know where they ended up, but not a single one survived, nothing, none. Just the concrete. The Big Apple is not prepared. John Mattiuzzi captures the chaos in Manhattan on video. I started walking down to the water, the flood was starting to come up. It got pretty dangerous over here, because there were these metal sheets that must have weighed like 30 pounds. They were just woop woop woop! Flipping through the air. Car alarms, they're singing. Water levels rise relentlessly, pouring into buildings. Oh my God, oh my God. The door break open. The door just break open. Oh my God. The subway floods. And seawater gushes into electrical substations, which short circuit and explode. Then all of a sudden, my camera just lit up. Then we get another huge flash. A blue blast. Think it just exploded. As the power fails, explosions continue to light up the sky. And throughout the night, you'd see these blue explosions in the distance, which became extremely spooky. It looked like something out of, you know, Independence Day. By the next day, the hurricane reaches over 1100 kilometers inland. It was so big, it was causing 20 foot waves. People were surfing on Lake Michigan outside of Chicago from a storm that was pounding the east coast. Finally, Hurricane Sandy runs out of steam. It leaves behind a vast trail of destruction, and takes over two hundred lives. In New Jersey and Long Island, entire neighborhoods have been washed away. Meteorologists use a scale called the integrated kinetic energy scale to measure the overall energy of a storm, And Sandy had the second most ever on that scale. It had the energy equivalent of two atomic bombs, that's how powerful it was. Sandy was dubbed Frankenstorm by the media. A powerful beast of a hurricane. Was it a freak of nature? Or, like Frankenstein, could mankind have brought this monster to life by changing the climate? One hurricane is not enough to say for sure. But experts are also studying other remarkable hurricanes from the last decade. 2005 produced more Atlantic tropical storms than any other year on record. Including America's costliest weather disaster ever, Hurricane Katrina. Holy cow. That was the roof! In 2005, it's the first time ever we ran out of letters in the alphabet to name our storms. We actually had to go to the Greek alphabet, that's how many we had! And we had seven category three or stronger storms, unprecedented. 2010, second busiest season ever. And it's not just Atlantic hurricanes that are behaving strangely. In the Pacific, the strongest super typhoon ever known to hit the southern Philippines forms. And in the Bay of Bengal, three destructive cyclones make landfall in just two years. These recent events suggest hurricanes are changing in frequency, strength and location. But it seems they are killing less people. In 1900, a hurricane destroys Galveston, at the time the biggest city in Texas, and kills 6000 people. More than any hurricane in American history. In 1970, Cyclone Bhola kills over half a million people in what is now Bangladesh. The deadliest cyclone ever known. These hurricanes weren't necessarily more powerful than today's, the people were less prepared. When hurricanes hit 30, 40, 50 years ago, they pretty much happened by surprise. People had almost no time to prepare to get to safety. Forecasting didn't exist. Satellites didn't exist. Communication was primitive. The Mayor of the city of New York has ordered a mandatory evacuation of the island of Broad Channel. Hurricanes kill fewer people today because we have better technology, not because they're getting weaker. Now, pretty much anywhere in the world, if a tropical storm is coming towards the coast, those people know a storm is coming and while still you can have a huge tragedy, it is not the monumental tragedies that happened decades ago. To find out if hurricanes really are changing in strength... or frequency, the most reliable data comes from satellites and weather radars. They record every hurricane around the world and can measure their wind speed. And they seem to be picking up a disturbing trend: There are more of the most extreme hurricanes. The strongest tropical cyclones are becoming more frequent uh, globally it seems based on the limited data that we have. It's tricky though because we've only had satellites for about three decades. In some parts of the world we have observed an upward trend in the number of extreme cyclones. To be certain that the most powerful hurricanes are striking more often, we need reliable records over a longer period. But the recent trend does match what some scientists expect to happen as the mercury rises. Warmer oceans provide more fuel for hurricanes. So every half a degree Celsius or one degree Fahrenheit warming of the ocean, you're going to increase the wind speeds in these storms ten to 20 miles per hour, or 16 to 32 kilometers per hour. And so Sandy clearly was energized by the warm oceans and researchers believe that at least one degree Fahrenheit, or half a degree Celsius of the warming of that water was due to man-made global warming. So clearly, that had an impact. But there are other factors that could actually weaken hurricanes. We can't say for sure that hurricanes are gonna get stronger because there are other things that affect hurricanes as well. Wind shear, differences in wind height throughout the atmosphere for example, but the balance of evidence suggests that the strongest storms are gonna get stronger as those ocean temperatures rise. Another effect of global warming could make hurricanes even deadlier. Melting ice and warming oceans are raising sea levels and that will mean more devastating storm surges. Scott Mandia explains. Well, a storm surge is a like a basketball dunk in that it doesn't happen very often, but when it does, it's an extraordinary event. As powerful winds push seawater toward the coast, the water piles up. So you can imagine as that storm gets higher, it's kind of like somebody jumping up and slam dunking. That water gets up over the defense ...and does its damage. Only the most powerful storms can push the water high enough to cause floods. Just like only the tallest players can reach high enough to slam dunk. So now imagine if we raise the basketball floor a foot. Now the average basketball player can make a dunk where before only the tallest ones could. That's what's going on in the oceans right now. Humans are warming the planet, we're making the water expand, we're melting a lot of ice. The ocean's physically one foot higher. This higher sea level means that less extreme storms can now cause flooding. So now average storms are causing surges that inundate our coastal defenses. So we have worse damage from the extreme storms, and damage we never had before from what you call the average storm, like an average player normally can't dunk, now he can. Nice one. Storm surges are most damaging to places that aren't prepared for them. And as the climate changes, cyclones may start appearing in parts of the world they've never been seen before. Hurricanes, particularly the strongest hurricanes, are confined to very specific parts of the world. And that's because there are certain conditions which enable them to form and become quite violent. In a globally warmed environment those areas might change. We might get new hurricanes where they've never happened before. And we might have some areas that have hurricanes now, which don't have them with global climate change. In fact, this may have already happened. Hurricanes had never been known to form in the South Atlantic. Never, until 2004 when a hurricane appears out of the blue and slams into South America. Several years ago, a hurricane formed in the South Atlantic, much to our surprise, and hit Brazil. Fortunately no densely populated cities are hit, so the death toll is just four. Next time, Brazil might not be so lucky. One of the biggest risks with climate change is that it can bring violent weather to places which aren't experienced, who aren't hardened, who aren't practiced to defend themselves against that type of violent weather. In Brazil the hurricane that hit was fairly close to Rio de Janeiro which probably doesn't know what to do if a hurricane comes. Those areas could be particularly at risk. In the future, Rio could be right in the firing line. Trees uprooted, black-outs across the city, and homes destroyed. With a population of six million and over a million in poorly constructed favelas, a direct hit would be a catastrophe. Hurricanes may dominate the headlines, but the weather that has the biggest impact on lives is far more ordinary: Rain. Too much rain can have extraordinary consequences... bringing flash floods and mudslides. Destruction on a grand scale. More rain would affect people all over the planet. So scientists are searching for changes in rainfall patterns. They're monitoring the world's biggest drenching: The yearly monsoon in India. Trillions of gallons of water fall from the sky... Transforming the landscape from brown and dry... To green and fertile. Professor Sir Brian Hoskins is one of the world's leading experts on the Indian monsoon. The monsoon in India is just an amazing thing. It happens every year with great regularity. And it produces all water that can give them their agriculture and their whole life. This densely populated country has over a billion people. And they all rely on the monsoon to provide food and water. But India has a love-hate relationship with its rainy season. As well as sustaining life, it can also take it. June 2013. Hundreds of thousands of people make their annual pilgrimage up these narrow Himalayan valleys. They plan to return before the monsoon arrives here in July. But this year is different. The monsoon was running several weeks ahead of schedule and people likely were not prepared to have such intense rainfall so early in the monsoon season. The rainfall is three times heavier than normal for this region. The rain rushes down the steep slopes, causing the river to rapidly overflow. And stranding thousands of pilgrims in mountain villages. Local villager Kundilal witnesses the chaos. The river started turning ferocious at around-00. I saw everything. I was looking down and I saw everything being washed away by the river. All buildings were drowned by the might of the river. The river swells to a dangerous level. Submerging or sweeping away hundreds of houses. Now where the river flows is where all the houses used to be. Further downstream, Suraj Singh is working in a restaurant when the flood hits. There was a massive amount of water so we had to quickly escape. We ran up a mountain and stood on a rock. When we looked down, it was a horrific sight. Out of seven of us who worked in that restaurant, four of us had drowned there and then. The river sweeps hundreds of people to their death, many of them pilgrims. Maybe 2% or 3% of them managed to save themselves, but there wasn't much hope of survival. By the time the flood subsides, over 5,000 lives are lost. I had no hope of coming out alive. I kept thinking I'd never see my children again. Even now I'm home, I sometimes break down into tears on my own. We never thought such a disaster could happen here. I am 61 years old and never have I seen such fury of nature. The 2013 monsoon floods are the deadliest in India's history. Over the last decade, destructive flash floods have struck around the world from Canada Oh my God. Oh that's destroyed the back of his car. To Mauritius. Hey, be careful! To Australia. Here the most destructive floods in the country's history cause over 20 billion dollars' worth of damage. Oh my goodness. There's another one. Oh no. The rest of them are gone. Oh that is horrible. A canoeist manages to see the funny side... When a drive through becomes a paddle through. Would you like fries with that? Yeah all right I'll have a hamburger. In Russia, water sports enthusiasts make the best of the heaviest rain there in living memory. It seems nowhere is immune. Even in Saudi Arabia, almost twice the average annual rainfall drops in just a few hours... taking many by surprise. And in Brazil, flash floods strike so quickly that people don't even have time to escape their houses before they're surrounded by raging water. A daring leap saves this woman's life. But she loses her dog to the deluge. 700 people die in Brazil's worst ever natural disaster. In some parts of the world, it seems clear that floods are killing more than ever before. There's a better way to discover if the heating up of the Earth is contributing to more destructive floods. By measuring how much water vapor is in the air. There's 3% or 4% more moisture in the atmosphere globally than there was in the 1970s. And this is an entirely expected consequence of a warming atmosphere that evaporates more water off the oceans and leads to more atmospheric moisture. And with more water in the air, when storms develop, there's extra rain to fall. With that has come changing rainfall patterns. So if you look globally, there's a clear tendency for a greater intensity of heavy rainfall events. In the future, more moisture in the air could mean even heavier rain and more intense flooding. Particularly in tropical regions like India. Here, the monsoon could drop up to 15% more water than today. Raging floods could overwhelm the country. So we're getting more rain. But weather experts are struggling to solve a cruel enigma. As much of the world gets wetter, other parts get drier. Why? In the sub tropics, think the desert parts of the world, there's actually less rainfall. The parts of the world that are already very dry tend to get drier. And possibly the only thing worse than too much rain, is not enough. Drought. A shortage of water creates a big problem. As the vegetation becomes stressed in a drought, the roots die off. The soil is then loose um, and the wind can come along and lift little grains of soil up. And you get these rolling billows of dust that blow across the landscape. When these build up, they can grow into one of nature's most spectacular phenomena: A dust storm. Phoenix, Arizona. July 5th, 2011. After nearly 14 consecutive dry years a strong wind picks up vast amounts of loose parched soil. Holy Cow! Massive dust storm coming towards us! Arizona has dust storms every year, but this one is different. People stop and stare at the 160 kilometer wide wave of dirt. Seriously Wendy, get out of the pool. The biggest in a generation. What the hell is that? Mom I'm scared! Daddy! Oh my God! It's alright guys. John Melton is new to Arizona and its weather. As I walking around to the truck, I opened the door and happened to look up and see a gigantic dust cloud come through the neighborhoods there. I could taste the grit in the air. It was just a large boiling cloud of dust. The tidal wave of grit grows over a kilometer and a half high and swallows Phoenix whole. As the dust wall passes overhead, the entire city plunges into darkness. It's gone from day to night! The blanket of dust blocks out the sun. As I turned onto the main road here, I was just engulfed in the storm. This is a very regular route that I drive, uh, it just felt so alien and unfamiliar. Almost unrecognizable. It's just a crazy pitch-black dust storm. Can't see more than ten feet. It's like some kind of apocalypse movie, I swear. The spectacle is all over in 40 minutes. But the biggest dust storm in decades has left Phoenix filthy and stunned. The usually silent, invisible drought has made its presence felt. But a lack of water can have even more terrible consequences. America knows the perils of drought from bitter experience. There was a prolonged drought in the central part of the United States which is historically referred to as the dust bowl. In the 1930s, over 70% of the topsoil was blown away across a vast swathe of the United States. Destroying crops, causing livestock to starve and triggering one of the biggest migrations in America's history. Millions left their homes and farms in search of work and food. There are these classic photo montages of that period with farms just being buried in dust. It was a dreadful, terrible climate disaster. Yet the recent drought in America's southwest has been even worse. Particularly parts of Texas, and, and Kansas and Oklahoma uh, have actually been more impacted in the, in the 21st century than they were in the 1930s. Some estimates put the cost of the North American drought at over 100 billion dollars. I just looked at my thermometer and got 105 in the shade. Look at the bottom of that, it's all turning yellow. Leaves are dying on it. So I don't know. Stalks are kind of puny. This, along with other unusually extreme droughts around the world, has been described as a mega drought. In South America, mega droughts are affecting the world's biggest rainforest. There was a 2005 drought in the Amazon that broke all the records. Hundred year event. Happened again in 2010! In 2010 there was a drought that was even bigger than the 2005 drought. Ah, you do the maths. How many 100 year droughts can you have in ten years? The unusual severity of these droughts could be down to another factor. As well as less rainfall, more heat from global warming could be drying everything out even more. As the air gets warmer, it evaporates more water It evaporates from the plants, it evaporates from the soil, it evaporates from irrigation ditches. You can see the plants drying out. The consequences can be catastrophic. As drought increases of course, there's less forage for livestock, less water for cities and for people. Uh, in our part of the world, we're reasonably adapted, we have reservoirs and we have water sources. But in uh, the developing world it can be absolutely catastrophic for the people that live there. There are huge swathes of Africa already incredibly vulnerable to drought, areas where millions of people subsist on a pastoral economy, grazing cattle on very sparse grass. 2011. The worst drought in 60 years devastates East Africa. Crops fail across a vast region, leading thousands to flee their homes. Drought leads to famine. The very severe drought and the severe weather meant that many, many people starved and many, many people were displaced in search of food as a result of that extreme weather. One estimate puts the death toll at over a quarter of a million. Making the drought one of the deadliest weather events of this decade so far. The drought and famine prompts climate expert Peter Stott to investigate if climate change contributed to the disaster. He uses a supercomputer that completes 100 trillion calculations a second, to simulate the drought and to analyze the factors that could have been involved. The results are bleak. What we found with that study was human induced climate change had increased the risk and therefore had increased the vulnerability significantly of those people uh, greater than what it would have been if we had not altered the climate. Climate change has already made droughts even drier, with deadly effect. In the future, they'll get drier still and dustier. Models project that actually southern Europe, the Mediterranean region, North Africa, they're probably going to suffer the most from drought. Just devastating droughts. By mid-century, southern Europe could face more extreme droughts. Parts of Italy, along with Greece and Spain, could turn to semi-desert. Experts are close to solving the riddle of how some parts of the world can get drier, while others get wetter. But there's an even bigger mystery in climate science. As the world heats up, some places seem to be cooling down. Spring 2013. Britain is in the midst of a big freeze. Temperatures are up to 10 degrees below average. Usually any snow has thawed by now... Instead, deep snowdrifts bury much of the country Give it a try then boys. BOY Ok daddy, here we go! The month of March in particular was extremely cold, and it was I believe a record in England and Wales and we have a long period for that record. And Easter was just terrible. So people were freezing. It was very unusual. The holiday weekend is the coldest for 50 years. But not everyone has time to enjoy the un-seasonal wintry scenes. Farmers, like Gareth Wynn Jones, are hard at work. At his farm in Wales, the snow has come at the worst possible time. It's lambing season and thousands of pregnant sheep have been trapped under a meter of snow for four days. This snow has come very late. My father's 77, he's never seen anything to touch it. This time last year, we were in shorts and T-shirts and this year, we're digging sheep from massive snowdrifts. Many of his sheep succumb to the freezing temperatures. It's just frozen solid you see. But then, his dog picks up a scent. Have they found this one in time? She's cold and stiff, but alive. Unbelievably. 4-4 days... She'll bloody survive now. Job well done boys. Job well done. You've got to think. She's been cocooned in there for four days. You think about it. It's being buried alive, isn't it, it's a tomb, isn't it. That's what, that's what people don't understand. The sheep is still pregnant, and shortly gives birth to a healthy lamb. But thousands of other sheep and lambs across the Welsh valleys are not so lucky. It is a crisis, and we just have to cope with the situation, because, one thing I tell you, these mountains will have a lot less sheep on them, and maybe a lot less farmers as well. Over the last few years, Britain has endured some surprisingly cold winters. The expectation a few years ago was, "oh everything's going to warm up so we'd forgotten those cold winters." And then it was a bit of a shock when we actually got a really cold winter. We got a really cold winter in 2009-10 and then a very cold December 2010, sort of record levels, really intense. As temperatures plummet in the UK, much of Europe shivers through some of its coldest winters. First time in history of Split. Snow like you cannot believe. In Ukraine this house, like many others, is buried in a snow drift. They finally dig their way out. An ice storm turns Switzerland into a glistening fairy tale kingdom. Snow even reaches as far south as the Sahara desert. And Israel. Shit... he's done. Across the Atlantic, it's a similar story. Frozen roads cause chaos. This is so bad. What the hell? The winter of 2013 seems to go on forever. Oh no, it's pushing forward. This is crazy. In May, strong winds push a weird creeping tide of ice crystals off a frozen lake toward houses in Minnesota. Oh my God, Nicky, look! This freak cold weather leads many to question whether the world is really warming up. If the world's getting warmer, why are these winters getting colder and longer? The answer may lie in an unlikely place. The rapidly warming Arctic. Paradoxically, as the Arctic heats up, it could be cooling other places down. As it warms, it appears to be disrupting the jet stream, a band of fast-flowing air high in the atmosphere, which blows weather systems around the planet. That could be keeping cold air masses in place for weeks on end. Climatologist Heidi Cullen explains. The weather is a lot like traffic in Manhattan. When traffic is moving, everybody is happy. Same thing with weather systems. It's basically the equivalent of the jet stream zooming along and the weather systems moving along right with it. The jet stream is actually steering our weather systems around the world. Like cars passing an intersection, you never have one kind of weather in one place for too long. Cold weather quickly moves on, giving way to warmer weather, and then colder weather again. But if that Jetstream slows down the weather systems slow down with it. We're basically seeing the equivalent of a traffic jam in the atmosphere. This is known as a blocking system. And it causes one type of weather to get stuck in one place for a long time. That's exactly what we saw in Europe and the US this past winter - we had you know blocking pressure systems and you just had cold weather essentially locked in place for months on end. When the weather is moving people can deal with it, but just like with traffic in Manhattan, you know when you're in gridlock, it's miserable. Blocking systems, like traffic lights, stop anything from moving on. Instead of a brief icy blast followed by a warmer spell, the freezing air is fixed in place. In the future as the Arctic warms up even faster, the jet stream could get even slower, locking in the colder weather. Snowstorms could reach places we'd never expect to turn white. Ironically in a warmer world we could actually see colder winters and, and it really comes down to the fact that our climate system is incredibly complex. But these freak cold winters won't last forever. In the long term, you can think of it as the heat wins out over the cold. So we're gonna see more, more heat extremes and fewer cold extremes. As sea ice in the Arctic continues to melt, the traffic jam in the sky may have far-reaching repercussions. As well as big freezes, the same blocking systems could make all kinds of weather even worse. When hot weather gets stuck in one place, it triggers even hotter heat waves, and more wildfires. When dry weather gets stuck, droughts get drier and dustier still. And when heavy rain gets stuck, it can cause catastrophic floods. Climate change is already making some kinds of extreme weather worse. More blocking systems would be a brutal double whammy. And the knock on effects of a warmer Arctic may even be changing the course of dangerous hurricanes, like Hurricane Sandy. Storms that move up America's east coast, normally drift out harmlessly into the Atlantic, but not this time. So Sandy took this very unusual course back towards land. There's emerging research exploring whether loss of sea ice in the Arctic may make storms taking that path more frequent in the future. Many scientists already expect climate change to cause more powerful hurricanes and higher storm surges. So a damaging shift in hurricane paths, if confirmed, would be a devastating triple whammy. Colder winters, hotter summers, droughts, floods, thunderstorms, wildfires and hurricanes spiraling out of control. The weather is already changing. And this is only the beginning. Just how bad will the weather get? The answer depends on the amount of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases, we release into the air. The carbon dioxide has risen in my lifetime from about 330 parts per million to about 400 parts per million. In my children's lifetime, it's likely to hit 800 parts per million. We ain't seen nothin' yet. If levels continue to increase at this rate, by the end of the century, temperatures could rise by as much as seven degrees on average and trigger extreme weather like we've never seen before. What we now consider a severe heat wave could be a normal summer. Sparking more wildfires on every populated continent. Powerful hurricanes could stray far from their current territory. And their higher storm surges could inundate the homes of 150 million more people. If we keep burning fossil fuels, coal, oil, natural gas like there's no tomorrow, we're on our way to a situation where these freak weather events we talk about now are going to be the weather normals by the end of the century. For storm chasers, pursuing freak weather is now an exhilarating way of life. Whoa, man alive! They witness nature at its most extreme. Wow! Are we gonna be ok? Yeah, yeah, fine. But even for them, as the weather changes, the future looks frightening. Can see what's coming. I know our weather is getting worse. I've seen it. I'm anticipating it to get even worse still. And as a storm chaser, someone who actively pursues these things passionately, I want to be there for the worst of the worst. But at the same time, I don't want to see the death and destruction that goes along with it! But many experts believe it's not yet too late to prevent this climate catastrophe. If we switch soon to sources of power that don't release greenhouse gases, we may only heat the world by two degrees. So it's really on us. We have choices. We decide the weather of the future. We decide today. Scientists are confident the weather will get worse. How much worse is up to us.
