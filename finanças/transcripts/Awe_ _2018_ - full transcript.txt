What is his name? Dad? When did you two start to date? What made you say that? It's been ten minutes since we got here. You have been on your phone the entire time. It could be someone from the office. Yes. Could be. But every 30 seconds you look at the door. It could be a friend. If it was a friend, you would have introduced them at home. When you said you wanted to work in the city, I knew that something like this would happen. I came from a village, but I don't have a conservative outlook like your mother. Why are you looking at me like that? Do you want to say something? Listen, dear. You are not a kid anymore. I have complete faith in you. So, what's his name? Krish. Oh, it's Krishna. Just the name? Aren't you going to tell us more about him? Krish is very punctual. Always on time. I'LL BE LATE. TRY TO MANAGE FIRST Very clever. I GOT LOST Quite brave. I thought you would be mad at me. I'm sure you won't make bad decisions. But... As for your mother? Mom, please. -Postpone your vow of silence till Monday. -She won't. She's been doing it since you were born so that you can find a good suitor. Poor soul. So, which caste does he belong to? Dad! It's for the sake of your mom and uncle. I'm not like them. I'm very broad-minded. You know that, right? His caste is the same as ours. Are you happy? What? Fine. I will ask her. Your mom is impossible, see? What does he do? Krish is a doctor, Dad. Always busy. Even I need an appointment to see Krish. Are they wealthy? Your mother had always wanted you to be married into a wealthy family. That's why... Krish's family is in the construction business. The flyover you took on your way here -Yes. -was built by their company. They are wealthier than you imagine. What is it now? I got it. Any siblings? No. Are you happy now? Listen, dear. This is not acceptable in our family. But I'm accepting it only for your sake. Thank you so much, Dad. So, when are we going to meet Krish? Right away! Krish! Mom, Dad, meet Krish. Hi, sir. Greetings, ma'am. What can you cook? Where did you work before? Famous. It's a well-known restaurant, ma'am. Oh, perhaps you hadn't heard about it before. Why did you quit? Their food is awful, totally inedible, ma'am. Weren't you the cook? The food was quite expensive there, so I used to eat at a nearby hotel. Everything you need is over there. I have a habit of listening to music while I cook. No password. But it's asking for a password, ma'am. The password is "no password." Get to work. -Make sure you clean the place. -Sure thing. That's it! It's done, ma'am. -Chow mein. -What? Chow mein. What was that? "Chavvu men..." Oh, she meant noodle soup? God! Please help me just this once. I will never ask for anything again. For one last time. Hey! You! Don't you have any sense? Won't you ever change? Change that expression of yours, first. You are good for nothing. You are damn lazy. Who is it? If you ever get in my way, I will use my tail and kill you. Damn! You jerk! I'm forced to live in this crappy water. My life was great when I was in the ocean. But now, it's horrible. Who's this idiot? He looks like a crabber. It seems he has never seen an aquarium before. What is he doing? Hey. What are you doing? He got scared and then scared me as well. What is he doing? You are holding it wrong. Hold it upside down. Can he hear me? How could a fish talk? He can hear me. What did I ask for? What have you done? A fish? My name is Nala. What? Were you named after your complexion? Did that hurt? I was just kidding, dude. What's your name? -My name is Nani, although I am a fish. -Nani? Do you know how to make chow mein? -Do you know how to swim? -No. Then I don't know how to make chow mein. How can a fish know anything about cooking? Are you crazy? Go consult a doctor. You need money to consult a doctor, man. If I was rich, I would have fed myself first. But you don't look poor either. It's been a week since I've had a proper meal. Oh, no! Nobody wants to hire me. I was hoping to get a job here. -And? -That's it. Okay, I understand. It looks like your life is worse than mine. Actually, chow mein is not that hard to cook. Do you know how to cook? I've never cooked it, but I have seen it done a million times. -Will you help me? -What's in it for me? Whatever you want. Will you take me back to the ocean? Aren't you safe in that fish tank? In the ocean, you have to struggle for food. That's my problem. Why do you care? Okay, then. Get those noodles from the corner shelf. We'll start now. Get some carrots. Just one? Slice it properly. An onion also. Pour some oil. Enough! -Add some mushrooms. -What? Four? Five? Four or five will do. Enough! This one? -Water. Hey! -Booze? -Right, water. -Yes. I got it. Not that! Noodles, you idiot. It's just noodles. I can handle it. Careful! It's hot. -Why didn't you warn me before? -Humans, you guys never listen. Chow mein. -Am I hired, ma'am? -Not yet. Nani! Buddy! Gross! Stay away from me, you nasty fellow. Stop kissing the tank. Go and feed me something. Here it is. Enjoy your favorite food. -But I just don't understand. -What is it? How do you know all these recipes? Chefs come and go, but I live here. Oh, my! -Here, have some. -Hey, that's enough. I'm on a diet. God! I'm so full. What would you like to have? Nothing, thanks. You are our special guest. You should definitely try something. What's your specialty? Now, I've got this job for sure. I can buy a new inhaler. You can never be a chef. Why? A chef can't be asthmatic. -Really? -If Ms. Chitra finds out, she won't hire you for sure. Look, she's here. Do you know how to cook bourride? I do. I can handle it. Thank God. Of course. You can't be a bowler if you don't know how to bowl. Likewise, you can't be a chef if you don't know how to cook bourride. Cut the crap. Can you do it? I can, ma'am. We have a very important guest. Make sure that he likes it. Who's this special guest, ma'am? It's none of your concern. Just do as you are told. Okay, ma'am. Don't worry. I will make a delicious bourride in five minutes. -If you do that, the job is yours. -Is that a promise? -What are the ingredients? -Tomatoes. -Lemons. -Yes. Okay, what's next? -Where is it? -In the fridge. What does it look like? It's pale and soft, like cottage cheese. There's nothing like that in here. It must be in the freezer. Look properly. Damn! No matter how many times I check, there's nothing that fits your description. -Check again. -I did. It's not here. Then you can tell Ms. Chitra that you can't make it and that you're giving up. Are you kidding? There is no way I'm leaving this kitchen without getting the job. You can't make that dish without fish. Salmon is a type of fish? Did you use salmon instead of cottage cheese in the previous dish? If Ms. Chitra finds out, she won't hire you for sure. Dude! The Wi-Fi is working fine now. You don't need me anymore. But you don't have the fish for the recipe. Where will you find one now? Why is he giving me a weird look? Why are you looking at me when we are talking about fish? What are you doing, dear? I'm working, sir. What's that? You won't understand. If you keep doing this, who will do your actual job? Charlie. Charlie. Did you build that? Fine. Do whatever you want. I will give your paycheck to Charlie. What about the book I mentioned, sir? If I keep buying you all the books you ask for, soon I'll be the one wearing your uniform and holding the door. Hi, good morning! I have come for you. For me? Now, let go of that door, so we can sit and talk. You want some coffee? No, thanks. We just had some. "We"? Tell me. What do you want to talk about? Please hurry. I have lots of work to do. Don't worry about this. You will fix it very soon. Tell me something I don't know. I am your future self. What? You heard me. We are one. You're kidding, right? Hey! It will take you 20 more years to finish building this time machine. On that day, you will travel back in time and meet your past self. Just like this. The reason I went back in time is to stop you from doing one thing. I got it. Where are the cameras? What are you talking about? Prank videos on YouTube, right? Hey! I agree. This will take me 20 more years. I'll go back in time and meet my past self. I am a man. You're a woman. Dad. Mom. Shiva. Now, Parvathy. Are you waiting for someone? Almost an hour has passed. Would you like to order something? How are you? How are you? Where is your mom? I'm the boss for today. What would you like to have? How did you do that? Our Indian breed cows are on the verge of extinction. Could you please donate some money to save them? SERVICE TO COWS Why did you do that? Magic is not child's play. You forgot your mojito. I didn't. Send it to my table. But it's self-service! Don't you know who I am? In what? SERVICE TO COWS Mom! If you scream, I will make your remaining teeth disappear. You might be a magician, but you're not the greatest. What did you say? You're not the greatest of them all. Then who is? The one who gave me this magic box. Where is he? There. Your order, sir. What did I order? Look at what you brought! I ordered a blueberry mojito. -You called for me? -Why have you come? -I am the boss around here. -You? Why are you here and not in school, silly girl? Today is Good Friday. It's a holiday. Why did you let him in? What happened? He paid for what he's eating. If you have a problem with that, you may leave. You are playing tricks. I won't clean it. Now, do you understand why I'm the greatest magician? Magicians make kids laugh, like that man does. They don't make us cry, like you. You are not even a magician, let alone the greatest of them all. He is the greatest. How much time do you need? What exactly are you doing inside? -Loading gas. -What? What else do you expect? It's an emergency. I need to use the toilet. -Okay, then. Come on in. -Disgusting! That's not my intent. I just want to have a word with you. Fine, talk. Not like this. Come out. You just said ten minutes. Are you making fun of me? Come out. Pick a card. You kept this one card upside down. Let's see if you can crack this. You can't even guess this. The one you lit was not tissue, it was flash wool. You wasted my time, you silly joker! You can fool that little girl with your stupid tricks, but not me. I just can't believe I wasted my time on a petty trickster like you. She claimed that he is the greatest! One last trick. If you can crack this, I will agree that you're the greatest. To see it, you have to go inside. Show me now. What? It's so sudden. How do I look? What the hell are you doing? We won't get a second chance. Hey, what are you looking at? Sir, that table is also vacant. No, I want this one. How many times should I apologize, dear? You get upset over petty issues. How long will you be mad at me? Tell me. Two South Indian coffees with cream. -Did the investor come? -No. I won't be caught, right? What did that old prick order? Two South Indian coffees with cream. Make it strong. How do you know? He's been sitting at the same table and ordering the same thing for the last 12 years. How long will you be mad at me? No need to get two coffees. Just one will do. Leave the other cup empty. What? It's been a week since you joined. Haven't you noticed? He orders two, but drinks only one. Trust me. I do not cross my line with you. This can't keep on. Are you playing games with me? How long should I wait? In that cup. Do you know how beautiful you are? What do you think? This photo was taken when she was your age. Back then, we used to live here. Here? Yes, to everyone else, this place might be just a coffee shop. But to me, it's my home. What? That was our study room. She was a very good singer. She would sit over there and teach music to our neighbors' kids. We had a 17-inch television in that corner. We had one of the biggest TVs in those days. And this table? This was our favorite place. Every day, we would sit here and drink some coffee at this time. Give it to her. Would you like to order anything else, ma'am? Can you get me a candle? Today is my birthday. -Is anyone else joining you? -Yes. You were talking about her the entire time? Exactly, sir. Yes. But you said the name Krishna. -Krish-- -It's Krishnaveni, sir. A girl? -Mom, what about your vow of silence? -Get lost. Really? A girl? Yes, ma'am. I'm a girl. Looks like you need to get used to the fact that I am a girl. Very well. I will order something. Non-vegetarian? No, ma'am, the goats are vegetarian. They feed on grass. I'm not sure about the chickens, though. You should ask her about it. What? You eat chicken? -Mom... -Not daily, ma'am. And on Fridays! Friday nights are party nights, ma'am. Once we get drunk, we aren't aware of what we eat. You drink? Krishna! Yes, ma'am. Not you! Both of you? Both of us? Both of you? Both of us? Both of you? Mom, we're in love. Yes, ma'am. Where the hell did you find her? Didn't you tell them how we met? I saw Radha for the first time at my clinic. She was wearing a floor-length Anarkali suit. She had her hair tied in plaits and a bindi on her forehead. She walked into my clinic, looking nervous. I was blown away instantly. I said I was hungry and took her out to dinner. We came here that day, right? Yes. Dear God! So what happened next? What was I saying? We got drunk. We spent the whole night there. We couldn't live without each other. You are living together? And before marriage? Does that mean you're okay with us getting married? I didn't mean that! Ma'am, don't you want to wait for your folks? Blackie. This is an injustice. It's a sin to kill your savior. If I didn't teach you how to cook, you would be begging on the streets by now. How could you do this to me? God will punish you with a horrible death. I'm just a fish. You're so selfish! Stop it, you fools! It hasn't even been ten hours. How dare you disturb my sleep with your bickering? I'm thirsty. Can anyone get me some water? Do you care about anything other than sleep and water? You're talking like a gentleman all of a sudden. Yes! I'm a gentleman. I'm not an idiot like you. Who are you talking to? A ghost! A ghost? A former chef had committed suicide here. His ghost still haunts this place. He will kill the person who replaces him. I am dying of thirst here and you're busy telling ghost stories! Keep quiet. I was trying to scare away this fool. Who is this guy? Is he a newbie? Who are you talking to? Who else? He is right behind you. Wow! He really does whatever you say. Try it yourself. Dude. I'm feeling itchy. Can you scratch my back? Your back? Why? Can't we have backs? Can't we get itchy? Not there, a little lower. Lower. There. That's the spot. Oh, that feels so good. While I was sleeping, humans learned how to communicate with us? Not everyone. Only this idiot. Whatever. We just lost our privacy. These petty humans shouldn't be able to hear us. That's true. But what can we do? This day is bad enough for me. Whatever. I really like this guy. You like him? Dude, he's planning to kill me! Now, I like him even more. Hey, Chanti. You'll let me die for the sake of having fun? Such a huge tip! Keep it. Has he arrived? Has the investor arrived yet? -Yes. -He has? When did he come? That... A ghost... Or else our plan will fail. Over there... Do you see anyone in that chair? Do you remember this watch which was your first gift to me? What happened? There's someone in here. Are you high? Yes. But that's not the reason. If things go wrong... This is for our future. All our problems will be solved with this money. I am repeating the plan. Listen carefully. Remember your promise? Do not hurt anyone. We need just the money. It's a new trick, but not the greatest. This is not magic. It's humiliation. See how silent it is in here? This is the most silent and most peaceful food court in the entire city. But I will never undergo an operation. What kind of operation? I will never! Who are you kidding? You know very well that you are a girl. How do you know the brand of mascara or the brand of nail polish she is wearing? -That was a casual-- -Listen. The reason I have come to meet you is not what you think. For my sake... For our sake, you need to do something. Don't fix the time machine. What are you talking about? Have you gone mad? Shiva! Turn on the generator. -Hey! Why won't you answer? -Shiva! I will wait. Go. Why don't you answer? Are you going or not? I'm on my way. She is asking why you didn't tell her. What? She is asking why you didn't tell her what you would become in ten years. That is... Me... I never... Don't be so tense. Sit down. There are many benefits to this. You don't need to worry about the dowry. We can share everything, from shampoos to shoes. It's very economical. Your daughter doesn't have to change her surname. There are other benefits too, but we can't discuss them with you. I love paya, ma'am. Krish! Krish! That's not me. It must be someone from the next table. Sorry, Dad. Krishna loves it. She can't control herself. Along with that bone marrow, it seems she has sucked the sanity out of you too. Mom! Do you serve sanity? My daughter has lost hers. I would rather approve of your love if it was with this guy. At least he is a man. How is it coming along? It's almost done, ma'am. Ms. Chitra! Do you know what he did? He served salmon instead of cottage cheese to someone. Kick him out immediately. Kick him out, I say. No matter how hard you try, she won't hear you. Do you hear anything? Can you also hear them? -Yes. -Hey, you brainless fellow! Pause the video on your phone. Hey, why did you tell him? He would have gotten caught! Can you please cut these? Me? For our special guest. Oh, he managed it well. You are so done, Nani. He's got it. Now let me see how you cook without the video. -Do it. -Just wait for two minutes. -Do it. -I'll finish you. He is so dead. It's simple, he'll give an excuse and send her out. You're excited to see me dead. You look a little upset. No. You look tense. It's nothing like that. As the saying goes, the customers are king. Why do you have to be here? Please, leave. Let me take care of it. Go, ma'am. Ms. Chitra, look here! Look here, Ms. Chitra. He has asthma. Look here. Ms. Chitra. Ms. Chitra! Ms. Chitra, look here once. Ms. Chitra! -Oh, he's such a bad actor! -Ms. Chitra! Hey, Nani! -Hey! No, don't do it. -You are so dead. What happened? You don't even know what this is? The power has been cut. -Where's my phone? -On your left. -Step forward, it's on the table. -Hey! Don't listen to him! -Didn't I tell you? -Oh, I burned my hand. Good. That was so good. -I wish it was his face. -Burned or not, his face looks the same. Nani, you are so dead once the power is back on. But it looks like you'll die before that. Oh, no! Why does it taste salty? What else would it be other than salt? But it smells... -It's not salt. -What? It's rat poison. Don't wipe it off. You look pretty. You are just a plant, after all. Mind your tongue. I can uproot you in no time. What "after all"? To start, you won't spare even a single leaf from us. You use our flowers, fruits, stem, roots, even our bark and trunk. The lamb, chicken, and pig that you eat also feed on us. How dare you take us for granted! You need us in every step of life, from birth until death. You take immense pride when you pee on us. Recently, you guys have started this vegetarian trend to lose some weight. And you say that being a vegetarian will help you lose weight. Have you ever seen a lean elephant or a buffalo? Fools! There won't be any bird, animal, life, fire, or nature without us. Not even the Earth could exist without us. Have you ever wondered where the air you breathe comes from? It's our fart. How dare you talk to me like that? I've got some money in advance. If everything seems okay, let's close this partnership deal today. My bourride? Ma'am, you're here again! Didn't I tell you... Make the dish and then you can take the check. Clean the kitchen before you leave. How dare you? Don't you understand? What? You thought I would be scared of a lizard? You wasted my time, you silly joker! I accept. You are a good magician. Can I leave now? Stop it. You are greater than me, I agree. Love between two girls? This is against nature. It's a sin. Listen, ma'am. Most people are right-handed, but a few of us are left-handed. This is a similar case. Due to the biological changes in us, we get attracted to the same gender. This happens with other species, too. This is also a part of God's creation. How can we call God's creation a sin? So, this is how you brainwashed my daughter? Why don't you say something? Have you taken a vow of silence now? She's lost her mind. That's the only reason. -Come, let's go see a doctor. -There's no need, sir. She is fine now. Who are you to say that? -I am talking to my daughter. -I am a doctor too, sir. A psychiatrist. -Shut up! -Dad! Don't raise your voice! You were so polite when you were younger! Whenever we had guests over, you would shy away and run into your room. You would never even dare talk to a guy. Even if it's your uncle! You have changed. You are no longer my Radha. We took good care of you... And this is how you repay us? Sir, you don't... Yes, Dad. You have taken very good care of me. Do you remember when I started to learn music when I was eight years old? The music teacher would make me sit on his lap. He took very good care of me by touching my thighs. Our family doctor, Mr. Subbarao. On the pretext of checking my heartbeat with a stethoscope, he touched me inappropriately. They weren't just outsiders. They were even in our own house. My own relative. My uncle! To put a 12-year-old to sleep, why did he have to touch here? There were many like him. Today, it was not only your vow of silence that was broken, it was also mine. Why didn't you tell us about this earlier? At that age, I didn't know what was happening. I tried telling you when I was younger. I feared you would stop me from going to school. When I grew up, I was scared you would marry me off. That's why I came to the city to be away from all those perverts. But even here... I had decided to commit suicide. She is the one who stopped me. If anyone battling depression comes to buy sleeping pills, I tell my pharmacy staff to send them to me. Radha was one of them. To learn more about her suffering, I took her out to dinner. One night wasn't enough to discuss her problems. It took a lot of counseling to bring her back to normal. I was able to help her overcome her fears. But her hatred for men is rooted too deep within her. She even feels disgusted when she shakes hands with a man. Not just Radha, many kids who have had these types of incidents in their childhood, face lot of psychological problems in the future. If parents talk to their children openly, situations like these wouldn't arise. We understand her hatred toward men. But her attraction toward women? In my case, it's genetics. For Radha, the problems that she had to go through have affected her sexual orientation. But how is this even possible? It's possible, Dad. Thousands of couples like us are living together in this world. What about kids? This is Seenu. He delivers the newspaper every day. If he gets a proper education, he may become a successful scientist. We are going to adopt him. This society will never accept this. All we need is your blessing, sir. I've failed as a father. This pain will haunt me for life. I am a little orthodox. I can never accept your relationship. What did you tell her? That I am your aunt. She says you resemble me. When he was a kid, he used to wet himself. If you don't want me to fix the time machine... She can't understand Telugu. There's no need to whisper. If you don't want me to fix the time machine, why did you help me with it? To make you believe in me. How else could I speak the Persian language? You learned it for her. You have done so much for her. But once she learns the truth about you, she will leave you. You will be heartbroken. You will spend the next 20 years trying to fix the time machine. You won't have any personal relations or social life. And finally, you will end up like this. If I don't fix the time machine, how will I meet my parents... How will I ever meet our parents? There is no use in finding them. They are going to die in a while. Why didn't you try to save them? Do you think I haven't? I've tried a million times. But every time I do, one person in this restaurant leads our parents to their deaths. Why would they kill our parents? There's no direct motive. In the next hour, the things these people are about to do outside will lead to our parents' deaths. Isn't there anything I can do to save them? There's one way. Hey, Nani! I know you must be hiding behind that statue or that boat. I will break that tank if I need to. You've helped me before. Help me one last time and I'll get this job. Okay. You've decided to kill me already. Do me one last favor. Forget the video. Just follow my instructions. Let's cook one last perfect dish together. Stop this nonsense! You are an aquarium fish. How can he follow you? He would be employed if he had been this clever. What? I thought you were joking. Are you seriously going to kill Nani? It's okay, Chanti. It's okay. If you're left alone, you can still live for 100 years. We only live for around ten years. When you're in a fish tank, it comes down to four years, which I would spend fighting with this brat or arguing with you. And finally, when I die, they will just throw me into the trash. Instead of living a useless life, I would rather sacrifice my life to help him. At least I would be happy that I was able to satiate someone's hunger. Go, turn on the stove. I can't live without Nani. Let him go. Hey, Chanti. I never knew you were emotional. Add a pinch of saffron. Add some more. Let me die graciously. You dreamt of getting back to the ocean, right? Aren't you sad it isn't going to be fulfilled? I am sad. I am teary-eyed. That's the advantage of being in the water. You can't see us cry. Aren't you afraid of death? Of course, I'm very scared. I want to close my eyes, but God didn't even bless us with eyelids. Hey! Please don't do it, man. He is running out of breath. He might die. Please don't do it. No! What are you talking about? Have you gone mad? Shiva! Switch on the generator. Hey! Why won't you answer? Shiva! I will wait. Go. Why don't you answer? Are you going or not? I'm on my way. That's not me. It must be someone from the next table. I told her to turn the power back on in 40 seconds, but it's only been 30 seconds. That belongs to Mr. Raghuram. Raghuram and his wife... What do you know about them? Please tell me. Mr. Raghuram was in love with Ms. Vaydehi. Right here, they had a beautiful house at this very same place. In a major accident, she was paralyzed and lost her voice. From then on, he closed down his business and started spending time with his wife. Nobody ever knew she was living in that house. Money lenders tried to get the house. But he didn't let them. So, they demolished the house while he was away. At that time, Ms. Vaydehi, who was in that house, could not move or call for help. She was buried alive under that tree. It's the locket! It's mine. I forgot it here. Who is he? Hey, Nani! Even though I'm going to miss you, I'm happy your dream has come true. Thanks, Blackie. If you ever call me Blackie again, I'm going to cut you and make fish stew. Sorry, dude. I won't say it again. -That's better. -Let's go. Hey, watch out! Sir! Is there a pond nearby? Hey, not a pond. The ocean. Hey, don't interrupt me while I'm talking. Who are you talking to? Is that our fish? No, sir. It's mine. Hey, make an excuse and move on. The paperwork looks perfect. Let me introduce you to my daughter, Moksha. Show your magic trick to him. Isn't it in your hand? What's this behind your ear? Leave it. Leave me! Please don't hurt her. You bit me. You want to die? I'm going to shoot you. How could you laugh, seeing that little girl in danger? Don't worry. She'll be fine. Please leave my daughter. Tell me what you want! Kids have a very fragile mind at this age. She may be disturbed mentally. She's already getting traumatized. How dare you lecture me! Poor thing. Please do something. Hello! It's nothing. I'm telling you out of experience. Don't make her cry. -What's in your pocket? -Nothing. Nothing! Hey! Don't come forward. Nobody is going to stop you. You can happily leave. Open the gate. No need. He is using you as a distraction. Mom! Hey! Let go! Let go! -Radha! -Oh, God! Radha! -Hey, what did you do? -Radha! -Oh, dear! -Radha! -Radha! -Oh, no! Hey! Hey, do something. Someone take her to a hospital. -Oh, God! What do we do? -Hospital. Shiva, open the door. Open it. Nobody is allowed to go out. I will shoot anyone who tries to go out. Have you lost your mind? Let us through. If anyone goes outside, my parents will die. I won't let that happen. How will your parents die if we go out? You won't understand, even if I tell you. Just wait for an hour. What are you talking about? I'm not going to let you go. Wait for one hour. -That's it. -Shiva! Just look at her. If we don't reach a hospital in ten minutes, she will die. To save your parents, will you let their daughter die? Dear! I'm begging you. I'm just like your mother. Listen to me. Please let us out. Dear, please. I tried so hard not to shoot you! It's my leg that would get injured, too. But I couldn't help it. You get persuaded by their words every time, and you let one of them go. If they go out, our parents get killed. Once, it was because of you. Then, it was because of you. And then, you. Finally, it was because of you. I won't repeat the same mistake again. I won't let it happen. Even if I have to kill everyone. From ignorance, lead me to truth. -From ignorance, lead me to truth. -From ignorance, lead me to truth. From darkness, lead me to light. -From darkness, lead me to light. -From darkness, lead me to light. From death, lead me to immortality. -From death, lead me to immortality. -From death, lead me to immortality.
