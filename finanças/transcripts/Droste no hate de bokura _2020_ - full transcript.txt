EUROPE-KIKAKU Shimokitazawa Film Festival Dad, I'll clean up the rest. - Bye. - Thanks for coming. - Can we close up now? - Yeah. Are your rehearsals going well? Don't mock me. I'll bring a sign with your name on it. And I'll shout out to my fans. - Bye. - Boss, wait. Get home safe. I live upstairs. Have a good night. BEYOND THE INFINITE TWO MINUTES Hey, you. Over here, toward the monitor. Hey. It's me. Okay... Apparently, I'm in the future. Two minutes in the future. - Are you talking to me? - Yeah, you. - We're having a conversation? - Yeah, we are. Word chain, starting with "L." - Limbo...dancing. - Gizzard. Mont... Blanc? You lose. It should start with "D." What is all this? I'm not sure, but I'm in the future. You're in the past. I was just in your shoes. What? You lost your pick, right? Yeah. Look under the rug. It's there. - I found it. - Yeah. I learned that from the future, too. Your monitor and the shop's TV are linked with a two-minute delay. - Okay. - So, come down here and explain this to yourself now. It'll make sense soon. You're back. Hey. What's up? Oh, nothing. Hey, you. Over here, toward the monitor. Hey. It's me. Okay... Apparently, I'm in the future. Two minutes in the future. - Are you talking to me? - Yeah, you. - We're having a conversation? - Yeah, we are. Word chain, starting with "L." - Limbo... dancing. - Gizzard. Mont... Blanc? You lose. It should start with "D." What is all this? I'm not sure, but I'm in the future. You're in the past. I was just in your shoes. What? You lost your pick, right? Yeah. Look under the rug. It's there. - I found it. - Yeah. I learned that from the future, too. Your monitor and the shop's TV are linked with a two-minute delay. - Okay. - So, come down here and explain this to yourself now. It'll make sense soon. What are you doing? Nothing... I'm just chatting. With who? With myself. Chatting with yourself? Yeah, with myself. Hey, what are you doing?! - Redo it later. - I worked hard on that! The Future The Past - Okay. - This isn't okay, what are you doing? - This is a dream. - No, this is reality. Hey, wait! This is a dream. Why did you even come down here? Wow, what a dream. It's just a dream. This is all a dream. Yup, this whole thing is a dream. Time to wake up. Time to wake up from this dream. It's not a dream. It's real, somehow. Oh. I'm in the future and you're in the past. It's like science fiction. Also, there's trouble. Komiya is coming soon. - Komiya? - He's right outside. He's gonna freak out. Hide, or there'll be trouble. Oh, hey buddy. Hi. You're performing, right? - Yes. - I'll be there. - Tanabe and Ozawa, too. - Great. We're gonna mosh. Well, it's more of an acoustic show. Hey, what's this? It's you... is it a video? I guess, yeah. Is this for YouTube? Something like that. - You have a YouTube channel? - Look. Whoa, you do! Why are you doing YouTube? - You're not even talking. - You gotta say something. What are you doing? I'm not really doing anything. Did you just reply? I... did. This is really strange. How does this work? I'm not sure how this works. We're communicating... Conversing! Is this a livestream? - No, it's not... - We're in the present. We're live. What is this? Well, come down, since two minutes have almost passed. - Okay. - You just talked with yourself. I've never seen... Time to wake up. Time to wake up from this dream. It's not a dream. It's real, somehow. - Oh. - I'm the future and you're the past. It's like science fiction. Also, there's trouble. Komiya is coming soon. - Komiya? - He's right outside. He's gonna freak out. Hide, or there'll be trouble. Oh, hey buddy. - Hi. - You're performing, right? - Yes. - I'll be there. Tanabe and Ozawa, too. Great. We're gonna mosh. Well, it's more of an acoustic show. Hey, what's this? It's you... is it a video? I guess, yeah. Is this for YouTube? Something like that. - You have a YouTube channel? - Look. Whoa, you do! Why are you doing YouTube? - You're not even talking. - You gotta say something. What are you doing? I'm not really doing anything. Did you just reply? I... did. This is really strange. How does this work? I'm not sure how this works. We're communicating... Conversing! Is this a livestream? - No, it's not... - We're in the present. We're live. What is this? Well, come down, since two minutes have almost passed. Okay. Huh? You just talked with yourself. I've never seen anyone talk to themselves before. What sorta tech is this? It's not really tech... Is he a twin? A clone? Or AI? I'm not really sure either, so I don't know what to tell you. - Maybe it's this! - What's that? He was scribbling like a madman earlier, see? Stuff like "future" and "past." This must be it. It's so sci-fi. So isn't that what this is? A TV that transcends time, or "Time TV"! We could call it a Time TV, but... I'm not sure! It was like this before I knew it. I was suddenly calling out to myself. That's what you did earlier. I have so many questions. - This is your room? - Yes. And the guy there was me from the past. I was on the other side earlier. I was called over so I came here. Then, I called out to myself. It's confusing! To him, I'm in the future. - Let's head up. - Okay! - Which one is his room? - It's 202. - You're going? - Of course! Hello? Can you come to Paran? Can you come quick? Who is that? Don't invite him! It's amazing. There's a Time TV here! Please don't tell people. You'll see. It's super sci-fi! Yeah, bring him too. Who's coming? Tanabe and Ozawa. - No, the cafe's closed already! - Here we go! Oh, it's you guys. - This is the Time TV? - Exactly. Is this a video? It's not a video at all! It's us. What's happening? It's us in two minutes. Alright. I got it. This is us from two minutes ago. Try asking a question. What's the capital of Sri Lanka? Wasn't it long? - Sri Jayawardenepura Kotte. - Yeah. Amazing! You got it right, and we're communicating. Hey, Past Aya! Send Ozawa a sticker. Anything is fine! Oh, how about... Check your messages. You got one two minutes ago, right? - Here it is. - My past self will send it now. It's now or never! I sent it! See! The "now or never" sticker came two minutes ago! That's confusing. I'll do a magic trick. Name anything, and it'll be in my pocket. - Ketchup. - Darn, ketchup? - Bam! - Whoa, how?! My past self will get the ketchup. Get it and put it in your pocket. - Got any? - In the fridge. - Hurry, they're coming. - We're already here. - No, your past selves are coming. - What? - Let's go! - Yeah. Then, we left the room... - Hey! - Tanabe! Komiya called me about a Time TV or something? - You're here! Go inside. - You too, Ozawa. Oh boy, this is seriously crazy. Oh, it's you guys. - This is the Time TV? - Yes. Is it a video? It's not a video at all! It's us. What's happening? It's us in two minutes. Alright, I got it. This is us from two minutes ago. Try asking a question. What's the capital of Sri Lanka? Wasn't it long? - Sri Jayawardenepura Kotte. - Yeah. Amazing! You got it right, and we're communicating! Hey, Past Aya! Send Ozawa a sticker. Anything is fine! Oh, how about... Check your messages. You got one two minutes ago, right? Here it is. It's now or never! My past self will send it now. I sent it! See! The "now or never" sticker came two minutes ago! That's confusing. I'll do a magic trick. Name anything, and it'll be in my pocket. - Ketchup. - Darn, ketchup? - Bam! - Whoa, how?! My past self will get the ketchup. Get it and put it in your pocket. - Got any? - In the fridge. - Hurry, they're coming. - We're already here. - No, your past selves are coming. - What? Let's go! Then, we left the room, met you guys on the way down, and now we're here. That's the Time TV. - So that's the past? - Exactly! - You catch on fast! - I'm lost. I just know this isn't normal. That's correct. Okay, let me recap. This is... the present. - Yeah. - That's obvious. And, the other side of that TV is our past, two minutes ago. I see. But, from their perspective... this is two minutes into the future. - They can see us, too? - Yes. They see the future! We saw all this unfold. That's amazing. - So there's a time delay? - Exactly! This café... and his room upstairs... ...are connected by a two-minute delay. I don't know why. - Let's go. - Yeah. - To the future. - Room 202! Wait, hold on! Let's... not do this. We shouldn't know the future. And it's scary. No, really, let's stop. Just this once! - We have to see this. - Yeah. What a trip. Looking feels really taboo. - If it's taboo, don't look! - Shut the hell up! Hello? Yeah, we're looking for Takada. No, I'm serious. We have to be quiet. They're so scary. Aya, go close the café. Whoa! Oh, hey, look. We shall bestow upon you the future. You may ask us anything. This'll happen in two minutes? Oh, I got a scratchcard from the store. Where should I scratch? Ye shall scratch the left. Is he right? This is great! I won a sleeping bag! The future taught us as well. Go forth and teach the past. Thank you! This is amazing. I see, now we have to tell the past. Doesn't this feel like a loop? - Do you have any questions? - No. Ask how you should season your eggs. That's my choice. Oh, I have an idea. He was thinking of inviting his neighbor to his show. - The barber's daughter? - Yes. He's too shy to ask her. - Not true. - But you said so. I'm older, and we're just neighbors. - Ask your future self if it's okay. - No. The future will know. She said okay! - Whoa! - You asked her? She'll come! That's great! Let's go, boss! I should've asked something else! I don't need a sleeping bag. - Great job, bud! - Hurry! You looked so happy! Wow, so we know it'll be like that in two minutes. He was so excited. Good luck! - I'm going? - Yeah, since we know the future! I gotta go ask a question too. Excuse me. Oh, hello neighbor. Sorry for barging in. It's okay. Can I help you? I'm in a band and... - It's just for fun with my friend. - I see. If you'd like, we're performing. Sorry, I'm not interested. Oh, really? Music isn't my thing. - Okay, I'm sorry. - It's fine. - So? - She said no. She hates music. - But you said it was okay. - I got shot down. That's why I didn't want to. - Go and say she said okay. - What? - It'll contradict otherwise. - But she said no. I'm scared of contradicting it! She said okay! Whoa! You asked her? She'll come! - Wow! - Let's go, boss! This TV is amazing! It's really a Time TV! Wow, it really works. There's no way this exists. Incredible. Then we can ask the future anything! Yeah, we can cheat. Um, apparently that's not really true. Just now, he... Well, I went back to the room to ask my future self questions, and... Oh, there I am. - Hello! - Hi. Future Aya, what's the next era in Japan, after Reiwa? I don't know. You don't know? Oh, that makes sense. Yeah, sorry. It's fine. I should say that to my past self too, then. Yeah. So she leaves and here I am. What was that? Nothing, it's embarrassing. You asked what's after Reiwa? Yeah, I thought Future Aya would know. Of course she wouldn't. Of course, since it's still Reiwa now. So we can't see past the next two minutes. We only know the near future, like this. What's wrong, buddy? The thing is... The future betrayed me. She rejected his invite. But you said it went well! That was a lie. A lie? It didn't actually go well, but to keep it consistent... I was tricked... and I did the tricking! I guess it's not always the right information. They might be empty words. Right, but we knew this was real because we saw it. And also... isn't two minutes short? - Yeah... - It's only two minutes into the future. I wish we could see a bit more. It's kind of limiting. At most, it can tell us how to win scratchcards. And if asking someone out goes well or not. That kind of sucks. I didn't ask her out. It was just an invite. I feel bad. It's your fault! How'll you fix this? It'll be awkward now. So you do like her. I was warming her up! Well, how about this? Oh, did you think of something? Café - Whoa! - Looks incredible. Two Minutes Room, Café Is that possible? - Hey, I'm heading to your room. - No! - Aw, just for a bit. - Don't sulk. - Excuse me. - Sorry, we're closed for today. - Can we talk? - Please come tomorrow. - Is it a cult? - Maybe. They come here? Hey, you can't avoid us. We need you to listen. We're busy right now. - Um, hello? - Hello! Excuse me? Hello! Hey there. Whoa! Hey there! Hey there! I'm Ozawa, in the present. I'm Ozawa, two minutes later. I'm Ozawa, four minutes later. I see! I'm right, then? Yeah, your idea works. Works perfectly, like this. Awesome! What's happening? I don't know. - So I just need to carry this? - Yes. Take the monitor. Hey, can I take this? Can we? Please? Whatever. We'll carry this down then. Oh, we're being carried! Alright, I get it. He's carrying the monitor in the past. It's exactly what I did earlier. Wow, this is amazing. We might learn what's after Reiwa. Watch out for the railing. You'll hit it! Sorry! - Sorry! - I'm sorry. Okay, I'll take my leave for now. What are you doing with this? We'll face this toward the TV. They'll mirror each other and show the far future. - Exactly. - What do you mean? Um, you can see the future from here, and in that future, you can see more into the future. - If you do that... - Hey! It's easier to just see for yourself. - Yeah. - Got it. Okay, let's watch for now. We'll put these facing each other. I see. That way, we have the past, present, and future. - I see! - And then, I'll jump in here. I'm getting excited. It's time! What comes first? "Hey there." Whoa! Hey there! Hey there! I'm Ozawa, in the present. I'm Ozawa, two minutes later. I'm Ozawa, four minutes later. I see! I'm right, then? Yeah, your idea works. Works perfectly, like this. Awesome! What's happening? I don't know. So I just need to carry this? Yes. Take the monitor. Hey, can I take this? - Can we? - Please? Whatever. We'll carry this down then. Oh, we're being carried! Alright, I get it. He's carrying the monitor in the past. It's exactly what I did earlier. Wow, this is amazing. We might learn what's after Reiwa. Watch out for the railing. You'll hit it! Sorry! - Sorry! - I'm sorry. Okay, I'll take my leave for now. What are you doing with this? We'll face this toward the TV. They'll mirror each other and show the far future. Exactly. What do you mean? Um, you can see the future from here, and in that future, you can see more into the future. - If you do that... - Hey! It's easier to just see for yourself. - Yeah. - Got it. Okay, let's watch for now. - We'll put these facing each other. - I see. That way, we have the past, present, and future. - I see! - And then, I'll jump in here. I'm getting excited. It's time! - What comes first? - "Hey there." Whoa! Hey there! Hey there! I'm Ozawa, in the present. I'm Ozawa, two minutes later. I'm Ozawa, four minutes later. I see! I'm right, then? Yeah, your idea works. Works perfectly, like this. Awesome! - What's happening? - I don't know. So I just need to carry this? Yes, take the monitor. Hey, can I take this? - Can we? - Please? Whatever. We'll carry this down then. Oh, we're being carried! Alright, I get it. He's carrying the monitor in the past. It's exactly what I did earlier. Wow, this is amazing. We might learn what's after Reiwa. Watch out for the railing. You'll hit it! Sorry! - Sorry! - I'm sorry. Okay, I'll take my leave for now. What are you doing with this? We'll face this toward the TV. They'll mirror each other and show the far future. Exactly. What do you mean? Um, you can see the future from here... There. - Whoa! - Incredible! What the heck just happened? I don't really know, but what an amazing trick. Time sucker-punched us. So the present became the past, and the past is more in the past? And we can see the future's future? Right, so it's like a nested structure, or the Droste effect. It's like this. See the girl on this cocoa tin? She's holding a tin of herself holding a tin. - And it keeps going. - Right, right. Think of this as our future in two minutes. Then, four minutes later, six minutes later... - Right. - The future keeps going. It was like that! Yes, so basically, we used the Time TV to make a Droste framework. - A Droste TV. - Not a Time TV, but a Droste TV. Either name works. So we can see as far into the future as we want? Take off the blanket and it'll go infinitely. That's scary! It can go on five, ten years. It's a time tunnel! We probably can't see that far, since it's two minutes per TV. But can we see it if we try? It gets smaller and smaller, but we can theoretically! So, should we look? I'm scared, but yes! What if the world ends later? Like with nuclear war? - With everything in ruins! - That wouldn't happen. Then shall we take a peek? - Shall we? - Let's not. This won't end well. Come on. Just for a second. You might get back with that girl. We were never together. It's fine. Our vision is limited. Here goes! I'm so scared! What? Rubble? - You've been pranked! - No way! You got us! And with that, here's a message from Future Ozawa. I'm Ozawa from the far future! Hey, Past Ozawa! I'm Past Ozawa. Go to the capsule toy vending machine. You'll get a zebra pillbug! Seriously?! And that's the message! This is great! - What was that? - He was so far away. - That was me from the far future! - Huh? I got a message from the future's future's future's future. What's a zebra pillbug? I often buy capsule toys at the station, but the zebra pillbug is rare. And Future Ozawa told me that now's my chance. I'm gonna go get it! I'm so glad we can know the future! There's gotta be better a use! - A zebra pillbug? - He pranced out. He's wasting its potential. He's wasting his brains. Ask for something better. - Bye. - Where are you going? - Home. - Why? - Have fun. - Still upset? I don't want to know the future. You keep saying that. - So negative. - But you can't leave! - Remember the prank earlier? - With the rubble? - He was there. - I see. - You gotta do it! - The future is controlling us. A paradox will occur. - That's fine. - I found it! Use the poster. It's time. Come on. - Hurry! - Here goes! I'm so scared! What? Rubble? - You've been pranked! - No way! And with that, here's a message from Future Ozawa. I'm Ozawa from the far future! Hey, Past Ozawa! I'm Past Ozawa. Go to the capsule toy vending machine. You'll get a zebra pillbug! Seriously?! And that's the message! This is great! The future might be controlling us. I feel obligated to copy it exactly. Shall we see a bit more of the future? Okay, let's think of a plan. We can learn future horse race results. - Right! - The future can tell us the winner. Yeah, we can make bank. We can see even further by playing telephone. - Right, right. - We'll relay it through each TV. Yes! We can ask which cryptocurrency is profitable in half a year. We'll do the telephone game from six months later. Wait, that means we have to stay here forever. Right. - We'll be here for half a year. - That's true. And we might mess up the message. It could be a fake cryptocurrency. So we're limited to a few hours into the future at most. - Yes. - Amazing, a few hours. What if we ask where we can pick up lost money? What? Maybe we'll find 100 million yen in a bamboo grove somewhere. No one loses 100 million. It's an example. - A cashed paycheck? - No one uses those. - Hm, we ended up talking money. - Yeah. It's natural if you know the future. Yeah, let's start by asking our future selves. They'll tell us. Our future selves will know. They already know, so we'll just do what they say. The future may be controlling us. Well, it's all decided anyway. A predetermined road. We shouldn't go in yet, right? And that's the message! - Okay. - Let's go. Hello? Ta-da! Where did you get that? - Picked it up. - What?! There's a VCR player in the trash under the station overpass. And, a stack of cash was inside! Where'd it come from? Maybe it's someone's secret stash. Wow, the Droste TV is amazing. Okay, okay. It's up to you whether you go or not. You'll go, though. Let's go. - You're going? - It's a stack of cash! - Easiest money ever! - But... aren't you scared? It's scary, but we have to. We saw the future. We had cash four minutes from now. It's already a done deal. It's a bit unnerving though. People really drop cash in the streets! What a great future. Excuse me. - Hello. - Sorry about earlier. It's fine. How can I help? You're a musician, right? Yes, well... Um, do you want this? - It's a cymbal. - A cymbal? Do you play drums? No, I play guitar. Oh, you wouldn't need a cymbal. No, but we do have a drummer. Oh, then please use this! Why are you giving me a cymbal? My friend left it at my house a long time ago. I figured he doesn't need it. I see. I wanted to throw it away, but wasn't sure if I should. Sorry for pushing it on you. No, he'll be happy to get it. He can always use a spare cymbal. Give him my regards. Oh, that's... What is this? It's kind of hard to explain. It's pretty complicated, so please ignore it. It's up to you whether you go or not. You'll go, though. You amateurs can't fool us. Yes, you're right. Hey, come here! No, I'm not involved! - Just come. - Please! Stop! I'm not part of this! Hey, I'll come save you, so wait for me! Hurry up! Was that me... just now? Um... When... Wait, that was me! This is... hard to explain. Huh? When did you take this? What is this? - Go home. - What? Please leave. You'll end up like that. - It makes no sense. - It won't make sense. Forget it and go home. Oh, your neighbor? You got back together! - Huh? - Nothing. - Did you see the Droste TV? - What? It tells us the future, and it looks bad, so leave. Sorry, he hates the future. Yes, it's bad news. This is an abandoned VCR player. The future told us to find it, and there was cash inside! It's amazing. It tells us the best. Hello? Ta-da! - Where did you get that? - Picked it up. What?! There's a VCR player in the trash under the station overpass. And, a stack of cash was inside! Where'd it come from? Maybe it's someone's secret stash. Wow, the Droste TV is amazing. Okay, okay. It's up to you whether you go or not. You'll go, though. Got it? Wait, what? - We kept it consistent. - It's amazing! Try it if you'd like! We figured it out. It's like the world's in our hands! Hey, you with the world in your hands. You look great with all that cash. Where'd you get it?! Nowhere special. Honestly, we're a little high-strung. A youngster at our agency ran off with our money. He's feeling sorry now, but he said he hid it somewhere! A place that only his crew knows about. In a VCR player. He used a freaking VCR player in the age of Blue-ray. Hey, don't move! Who are you all? This is a café. They're all customers. They got the cash by chance. We'll return it to you. Let's talk in our office. We have nothing to do with... There's no way that's true. No, um, it's really true. We won this from betting on horses and won big. - The VCR player... - Hello? Ta-da! Where did you get that? Picked it up. What?! There's a VCR player in the trash under the station overpass. And, a stack of cash was inside! Where'd it come from? Maybe it's someone's secret stash. It's... not what you think. We found it. We found it... right? We didn't... - Did we? - We found it, but... You amateurs can't fool us. Yes. You're right. - Hey, come here! - No, I'm not involved! - Just come. - Please, stop, I'm not part of this. Hey, I'll come save you, so wait for me! Hurry up! Don't call the cops. I met these people for the first time today, really! We're complete strangers! Wait your turn. Wait, why are you relaxing? They took her away! Boss, are you okay? - Where is she? - Taken away. I think they're in the fifth-floor office. - Boss? Wait, that's... - I got her involved! - They said to wait! - Get off! Get off! - Get off! - I got a zebra pillbug! Woo-hoo! Why is it so tense? - Now's not the time for that, Ozawa! - What? We're in a pinch! We got a stack of cash. - What? - But it's dirty money, and some scary people came. - And they took the girl next door. - Why?! It's out of control. Come. Take a look at this. It was dirty money, but the future told us to get it. By future, I mean the future when we were in the past. Yeah, I get it. Anyway, just look. It's up to you whether you go or not. You'll go, though. The owner of the money accidentally saw this. You amateurs can't fool us. Yes, you're right. Hey, come here! No, I'm not involved! - Just come. - Please, stop, I'm not part of this. Hey, I'll come save you, so wait for me! Hurry up! And that's what happened. Come on, let go. - I'm calm. - But you're not! Hold on a second! If it's in two minutes... This is... doing that... I see! And before that... - I'm going. - You can't! Listen, you have a role to fulfill. And... - I do, too. - Here's a message from Future Ozawa. I'm Ozawa from the far future! Hey, Past Ozawa! I'm Past Ozawa. Go to the capsule toy vending machine. You'll get a zebra pillbug! Seriously?! We have more urgent matters! I finished my role. You have to go to the office. But take the TV that sees into the past. - What? - I'll give instructions. Your future self is already going up! - He's taking this up? - Yes. - And give us info from the future. - How? Just show the scene to our past selves. Then we can see what's to come. Buddy... - Good luck. - We'll watch from the past! You amateurs can't fool us. Yes, you're right. Hey, come here! No, I'm not involved! Just come. Please, stop, I'm not a part of this. Hey, I'll come save you, so wait for me! Hurry up! Boss! - Put this in your front pocket. - What? You can do it. Hey, buddy! A cymbal for your back. A cymbal? Don't die. This cymbal is so heavy. Wait! Hold on. Use the pillbug when he comes at you. The pillbug? - He hates bugs. - I'm carrying too much. You were so cool! But I haven't... - Your knots suck. - It's my first try. This sofa is too freaking big! It's getting loose. What? Please let her go. She's innocent. What? If you'll excuse me... Hey! Don't get cocky, punk! Shut up! Hey, why did you stab him?! He came at me! You're not supposed to murder him! I know! - Put ketchup in his pocket. - Got it! How dare you. - Cymbal, on the back. - Okay! Get away from me. Sorry. Take this. - The pillbug! - Roger! Let's get back. Okay. Bring the TV back. I apologize for all this. Are you okay? Yes, I'm fine. I'll explain properly later. This TV is causing so much trouble. It's a Time TV? Really? Yes, apparently. You catch on quick. I guess so. I'll call the police when we get back. Um... Thank you. No, don't worry about it. It was our café's fault. Did you know the outcome? No, I didn't know what was gonna happen. Oh. But I could've known if I looked from the past. That makes me a bit frustrated. Tanabe? Tanabe?! - Tanabe! - Oh, hello. Who are you people? Aya? Ozawa? Please hide. I'll take a look. Hello. Sorry for bothering you. Hello. You own this café, right? Oh, please relax. We're not suspicious people. - You're suspicious. - Yeah! Your companions are taking a quick nap. But you two are fine, since you're sensible. We're from the Time and Space Bureau, far into the future. See? Time and Space Bureau. A cult? It's not a cult. Well, think of us as the "time travel police." Oh, right. That TV and this monitor have formed a wormhole disturbance. It's rare but it happens sometimes in space-time. Now, if you'll allow me to take a look... As I thought, the causality was reversed. Was it set up this way earlier? Yes... but I didn't do it. Of course not. Doing this allows you to see further into the future, but it'll cause an immense time-space disturbance. It could also bring about a paradox. This usually counts as a temporal felony and you'd go to time jail, but you didn't make any illegal profits from it. So you'll just get a warning. Moreover, you two tried to rectify the situation. And so, we'll take over from here. Let's forget today ever happened. - Forget? - Here's a memory wiping agent. Once you take this, we will reset everything. Reset? You'll forget these events and go back to how you were before this evening. Memory erasing technology has improved lately. We used to erase everything or give you a new identity. Now we can safely remove only the past several hours and have you two return to your normal lives. We'll forget everything that just happened? Correct. And I'll forget that I came here? Correct. This is you in two minutes. Okay, okay. You're taking the medicine. Okay. Thud. And you're next. You cooperated, too. - Thank you! - Thank you! By the way, a different team is dealing with the fifth floor. Those two have no effect on the future, so we could erase them. Well then, here you go. - Here. - Oh, you'll need water. Um... What if we don't take it? Oh, that won't happen. You're required to take it. I mean, it's already set in stone. I don't... want to take it. Geez. Regardless, it's the rules. It's the fundamentals of the universe. Listen here. The future is built on top of history. Once you all fulfill your roles, our future can build on top of that. History... is built up in layers. If the past goes haywire, our era will be in danger. - You're the foundation of our society! - Fine! I understand. You'll swallow it, right? The powder and situation. Well then, in about 20 seconds, you'll stand over there and take turns. As the future showed, she'll go first. These few hours never happened. - Come on! - Hey! Hey, what was that? Sorry, maybe I'm sick. We don't have time for this! - Quit fooling around. - Okay. The future's set in stone. Wait, stop, it's not you! She goes first! - Hey, stop! - Huh? You... Hey, there's no time! It's kinda dusty. You're doing this on purpose! - No way. - We're not. Can we get more? Our space-time causality will... Forget it. Just hurry up! You all don't get how grave this is. We won't make it in time! Small changes can rewrite the future! It's the butterfly effect! Oh no, you're disappearing. A paradox is occurring. The future... changed. Well... I guess that's fine. Will they really wake up? Well, he did say they were sleeping. Okay. Shall we wait? Yes. Would you like some coffee? Thank you. I'd love some. By the way, why... do you hate the future? When we were here earlier... Oh, it's a really stupid story. - I see. - Please sit. Do you know Nostradamus's Prophecy? The one where the world ends? I read it as a kid. The King of Terror was supposed to come in 1999. - Right. - And so, I thought the world would be in ruin when I'm an adult. I didn't plan much for the future, but the world stayed intact. Right. That's all. What? I mean, I really believed it! It felt like Nostradamus betrayed me. And then? I panicked and tried to plan my life, but the Mayan calendar said the world would end in 2012. I anxiously waited for nothing again. That's why I don't want to know the future. That's what that was? It controls you. Me, too. I used to date this guy in a band, and he kept talking about the future. His lyrics were like that too. He'd say to me, "Our future together is important." But his band got a little famous and he stopped calling. I mean, what happened to that future he'd talk about? It was even in his band's lyrics. And why am I letting that get to me? That's why I hate the future. Oh, and I'm sorry for giving you the cymbal. It's fine. It saved my life. By the way, is it really that kind of TV? Apparently. You can see the past and future? Yes, that's the future and that's the past. - Wow, so what happened earlier? - What do you mean? The chain of events with the VCR player money, the ketchup, the pillbug... - I don't know if I can explain well. - Tell me. Are you into sci-fi? Not really, but, I've read Fujiko F. Fujio's short comics. That's good enough. - Really? - Yes. Wait. You read sci-fi stories? Well, I really liked them! I liked the stories a lot more than Doraemon. - Doraemon is great, though. - Yes, of course! But those stories... Which one did you like? That's a hard question, since he wrote so many! In the third volume, there's a self-duplicating story. - Where he becomes three people. - Yes! - "Me, Me, and Me." - That one! - That's exactly what happened. - What? I became me and me. That's only two people. No, but there was me and then a me further back. What? Hold on, I don't get it at all. Where should I start? - From the beginning. - Okay. I got home, and my future self greeted me.
