I might as well-- Everyone calm down, man! So what happened back there, Pike? He almost put us in the joint. That's what the fuck happened in there, baby. That's what the fuck happened in there. You guys stop fighting. Stop fighting! You're stressing me out! Oh, yeah? Maybe you should do some deep breathing exercises, go out and learn some yoga, huh? Stupid ass motherfucker. I should be running this the way things are going. Chino, look at me. Look at me. Who grabbed the paintings off the wall? Chino. Who shot the security guards? Chino. Whose judgment was a little skewed? Chino! And you think you should be in charge? My fucking brother happens to like angels, all right? I'm sorry. I apologize. But it wasn't me who fucked up, man. They were supposed to fucking be guarding... those museum rent-a-cops, and they didn't, huh? Weren't you supposed to be watching the monitor, you faggot? The guy was asleep. He wasn't supposed to fucking be-- Oh, yeah, fucking David Copperfield. Stupid ass motherfucker. Pike, who is this little fucking piece of shit? Nobody was supposed to get killed. Yeah, well, they did, yo. They did. Listen, you got to have a heart, man. The deal was that I deposit you guys, and that's it. And then I get my fucking money, man. So give me the fucking money. Fuck this! You got no money. Fuck, man. It's back to the joint, man. Not for me, man. I can't go back. Not for me. Nobody's finding my G-spot. We're going back, man. Shut up. Just shut the hell up. Then what are we gonna do, boss? We ain't doing nothing. I'm-a take the goods to Miami, and I'm gonna get the money. - What about me, Pike? I'm coming with you, right? - No. Boys don't leave each other. You know what I'm saying? - No. - You're not gonna take care of me, man? This was Crane's show. He put the deal together with me. We planned this together. Now I know everyone and everything from inside out. Since Crane is dead, I'm running shit now. I don't give a shit who's running the show. I want my money. I'm the only one who knows the contact in Miami. Now I got 36 hours to meet this guy. You all are gonna sit tight, relax till I get back with the money. In your dreams, my friend. What? You heard me. Until I get paid, I go everywhere you go. You don't leave my sight. You hear me? Me too. I don't trust any of you motherfucking niggas. You guys ain't leaving me here. Pike, you hurt my feelings, man. I just wanted an angel for my brother... whose name is "Angel" and likes angels. Get in the car. And I explained that, but you don't fucking-- Get in the car. Hurry UP! I'm gonna make this call. You all sit tight, keep your eyes open. When Crane was here, it was a five-way split, right? Which was $3 million each. Now that motherfucker's gone, four-way split is four motherfucking goddamn million dollars each, man. Yo, four goddamn motherfucking million dollars each, Papa. Touch me again and I'll kill you. Whoo-hoo! Four goddamn million dollars. Whoo! Shit, baby! But don't you-- don't you think... we should give, like, Crane's family his percentage? Hey, what the fuck do you think you're doing? Put that shit out. We're just relax-- I don't give a fuck. Are you out of your mind? Just tryin' to relax. Put the shit out! Okay. What's your problem? Talk to me, Papa. You'd better sit down. You'd better sit down. I'm telling you. See, all that tension inside of you is gonna build up into a cancer. Okay. You should have some herb. - And what the fuck are you listening to? - Hey, whoa, whoa. John Hancock Museum was robbed early this morning... of millions of dollars in European masterworks. So far, the suspect killed in the gunfight remains unidentified. Unidentified. He's been unidentified, man. Nobody could be this stupid. Where did you get this fucking asshole? Hobbs is right, man. If you never took off your fucking mask, nobody would be dead, and we'd be getting paid right now. Why don't you regret being late? Then Crane wouldn't be dead, right? Only thing I regret... is getting hooked up with you. Some of you will be back here in a week. Some of you may make it for a month. Maybe even three months. But I know that four out of five of you will be back. You gonna miss me? Miss you? Oh, I'm keeping your fucking cell warm for you. Miss ya. Won't be more than a hot minute before you fuck up and get caught... and come back to me and our happy home. You're a two-time loser. But you know what? I hope you have a Merry Christmas. Okay, gentlemen, the day you've been waiting for. Pike, man. Whassup? No. I thought your sorry ass would be running to get out of this motherfucker. What's up, man? Whassup? - Kiss my black ass! - Yeah! Hello. Yes, this is Crane's friend. Yeah, he gave me this number because he won't be able to make it. I'll tell you about it when I get there. We're on our way. Benedict bitch. Huh? I'm fuckin' serious. Why bite my dick when your dick ain't big enough to put in your mouth? Put out that goddamn spliff, please. That's what I told him, Pike. Didn't I tell you to put it out? All we need is some cop to pull us over and smell that. You want some cop to pull-- Put it out. - Don't put it out. - Hey, put it out right now. Let's go. - Don't put it out. - What's happening? Okay, the drop is still on. Now we're gonna drive to Maryland and take a bus the rest of the way. Low profile. We ain't got any money to take a fucking bus. We got all the advance from Crane. It ain't much, but it should be enough. Hey, Pike, while you was out the car, man, we came on the national radio program. Oh, yeah. Top 40. Could be worse though. They haven't I.D.'d Crane yet. Shouldn't take long. The Feds are on it. Our only hope is a low profile. Yeah, that and nuclear warfare. Don't these country towns give you the willies, man? These country towns bug me out. I'm serious. I feel so freaky, you know what I'm saying? These are one of these towns that are perfect... till somebody goes postal and kills everybody.

Can I help you? - When's the next bus to Miami? - Only one bus. The Atlanta bus. That leaves-- Well, any minute now.

Hey, Elmo, did you see the nigger and spic got a pretty little mouth, huh? Come on, roll down them panties... so I can bend you over a log and hear you squeal like a pig. Hey. Hey- Hey, dipshit.

What are we gonna do? We won't lose any time if we catch the early train to Miami. What about our special friend in the front seat? - You let me worry about him. - That's your answer? - ♪♪ Nah. How do you like me now? Miami's gonna be nice. Yeah. I tell you, I ain't gonna be there long, man. 'Cause I'm gonna get on a plane and go straight to Seattle. You're going to Seattle? Hey, man.

You're driving a hundred thousand dollar car? Yo, I worked at the body shop all last year. Ask Pike, huh? What's this shit? So you could've saved? I could've saved up my money. Put it in a mattress, stashed it away. I guess you could've saved up a hundred grand at the body shop. I think that makes sense-- for a moron. A fucking moron. You fucking people are all alike. Beware. Toes you step on today... might be connected to the ass you'll be kissing tomorrow. No, I'm just saying that, you know, in a way, it's a shame that you had to go and get Crane killed.

What happened to your eye, young lady? Well, sir, my husband hit me, and, um, these are my friends. They were protecting me, and I was a little nervous. So we pulled over to the side of the road. You know, they're just calming me down. - You want to file a complaint? - No, that's okay. I already did. All right then. Y'all drive safely, hear? - Thank you, sir. - Thanks a lot, sir. Thanks, Officer. Same to you. Now what the hell was that? - What? - That noise. - Sounds like the trunk. - I didn't, uh-- Neither did I. I didn't-- What's in the trunk? All right, well, it's our friend. He broke his neck and we're taking him to the hospital. We got you, didn't we? How about you open up that trunk for me? There's nothing in there, Officer. You'd be wasting your time. For real. I'm serious. Step out of the car, please, sir. Show me that nothing. The rest of you, keep your hands up in plain sight. Don't anyone make any sudden moves. Come on. Someone help me out, man. Help me out, yo. Hobbs. Okay. Oh, sorry. Urn, I forgot my keys inside the car. Can I go get 'em? I'm sorry, man. Just forgot. Today, young man! The key's-- the key's stuck, Officer. Unstick it. I'm trying to get it, man. It's just these old cars, yo. 10.5., baby. Take care of business. See? See, Officer, this is one of these old cars... where you have to make sure the key's up. Otherwise, it don't work. You know what I'm saying? Damn, I dropped 'em. Can I get the keys? Thanks. Touchdown. Stay put. No more doughnuts for you, Officer, huh? Is he dead? No more crullers, no more honey-dipped, no more sprinkles, motherfucker. - - Oh, we really fucked up now. We killed a white cop in goddamn North Carolina. Shit. Hobbs] He's gone. What about her? We ain't killing no innocent girl. That's not what I'm talking about. I'm talking about the fact that she's a pro, man. Look at this eye. What the fuck do you mean? She can take a punch, man. No! That's not it. I'm talking about the way she handled our friend here. She's a pro. Look, this is not even up for discussion. Get rid of the body, get rid of the car now. Just so you heard it once, my man. - You're a natural born killer, son. - Thanks, Pops. You get Booker. I'll take him. Natalie ] I didn't do anything. Let me go. Please. I didn't do anything. Oh, God. DJ“ [Gasping 1 Man, just chill. Relax. ♪♪ Damn. You'll be all right, bro. Forget it all. You wouldn't know what to do with the money anyhow. Look, you don't know me. I'm crazy. I'll kill all of you. You don't know me. I'm fucking crazy. Listen up, Crazy, 'cause I'm only gonna say this once. You be cool, you gonna get out of this. But you got to get your shit together. So you do whatever you need to do to get your shit together, because if you don't-- He's good. Let's go. No, no. Come on. I think we should say something. Come on. We're all Catholic. Come on. Booker, earlier, Chino tried to grab your cock. I wouldn't let him. Amen. Okay? Let's go. Amen. Let's get outta here. Yeah, we're still good for time. I told you this was gonna be a walk in the park. Know what I'm saying? All right. Just go. What'd I tell you, Chino? Smooth like butter, baby. Smooth like butter. Chino? Chino? Damn. What the fuck is that light? What the fuck is that light? - Hey, what the fuck is it? - I'm not sure. Something must have been taken off the wall. I think it's the silent alarm. Took something off the wall? For Christ's sake! Oh, shit. They took a painting, man. What's that? Who the fuck is that? Look, save yourself, all right? Uh-huh. You save yourself. You tell 'em it was a false alarm. Okay. You give 'em the right code. Okay. Hello? Hello? No, everything's under control. It's a false alarm. Uh, 1-7-5-7 A-1-M-F-A. 1-2-6-5-3-4. It's a false alarm. Everything's under control. We're out. I'm almost done with my Christmas shopping, boy. Chino, you just set off the alarm. Relax. I don't hear nothing. It's silent, stupid. - Who the fuck is that? - Who? - Him. - Who? Him! Where'd he come from? Where the fuck did he come from? - Who the fuck is it? - Where'd he come from? - Where the hell did he come from? - He works here. He comes in late sometimes and sleeps in the office. Oh, shit. Chino, it was just a burglary. Just a burglary. Just a burglary. Pike, he saw my face. What are you gonna do with your money? I don't know, Sapphire. What are you gonna do? Are you-- Hey, guys-. Don't do nothing stupid. You hear me? Do you hear me? Don't do nothing stupid. Hey, let's leave his cocky white boy ass behind. Come on. Let's just go for it. - What would that do, Chino? - Yeah, what would that do? Check him out. Tell me you haven't been thinking about it. Tell me. Come on. - Thought about what? - You're good. You're smooth, ain't you? Fifteen million divided by five is how much? Three mil. Divided by two? Approximately seven-point-something mil, right? Yeah, but you got this all down. You've been thinking about it, haven't you, Pike? You know what your problem is, Chino? That I'm too fucking realistic? You're one giant set of need. Yeah. You see it, you want it, you take it. No thought given to the consequences. Crane used to call it the "blaze of glory" syndrome. Yeah, well, if I was you, I wouldn't be quoting a dead motherfucker. He ain't no criminal genius, and this ain't Ricki Lake, so save that shit. Yo baby, you got-- you got a man? - Sorry? - You got a man? - Yes. - You know, they call me Chino Soft Touch. That's what I'm famous for. 'Cause I got a soft touch, baby. You know, you and I could get together and hook up nice. Get out of the car. Come on! Okay, here's the bad news. This is long-term parking, and we need cash to get out. Why don't we just blast our way Jackie Chan style and whatnot? - I have some cash. - How much? Hopefully it's enough to guarantee my personal safety. Personal safety's gonna cost you a bit more than that, boo. Can I have a cigarette? We got 17 beans. That's enough. Let's go. If you had a Latin man, you wouldn't need a cigarette to be pleased. Oh, boy. ♪♪ Chino, where's Natalie? Oh, fuck. Look at this. Oh. You hit me, motherfucker. Dumb, dumb, dumb. Fucking dumb. Get back in the car, okay? Hey, do not fuck with me. I am on to you. Do you understand me? - So get back in the car. - Okay. Okay. You're onto me, but what about your friends? This is a mistake. Mm-mmm. The little one's trying to kill you, and you don't know a goddamn thing about it. It's a mistake. Get back in the car. When we were stealing the car, the little one told the big one that he wants to kill you, but the big one doesn't want to do it. I thought you should know that. Really? Really? Yep. How's your eye? It looks like it hurts. Does it? It does. Yeah. Go along with this. Look at that shit. Do you believe that shit? There's only one fucking explanation for that-- she likes white boys. Right? Yo, Hobbs, get off of her, man. Chino, do I have to watch you 24-7? He's trying to steal my girl, man. Yo, Hobbs, get back in the car. - Give me a dollar. - No. Can I please have a dollar? No. You know, we need to restock these cigarettes up here. Oh, the Clipper guy will be here. What's up, ladies? Good day. Good afternoon. Yeah, whatever. Hey, you got a nice place here. Yo, it's so mad organized. You can find anything you're looking for, right? Thank you. Anything, uh, in particular? Uh, yeah, I'm just looking for some sundry miscellaneous type stuff. I bet you two got some nice husbands waiting for you at home. - You bet. - Yeah, right. Tomorrow's my anniversary. Oh, that's beautiful. That's a beautiful thing, you know? Go home and give him some special lovin', right? Yeah, I know you like that. I think I'm good. I got my 40, I got a couple of Slim Jims, some fat-free crap, and I want some of this, uh, Deer-in-Heat Urine, 'cause you never know... when you're gonna meet a deer in the woods, right? All right, I just need one more thing. Oh. That's right, it's a fucking holdup. So empty out the fucking register now! Now! Open up the goddamn register! Come on, faster! Faster, goddamn it! Don't make me have to shoot your old ass. - Who you calling old? - All right, fucking mature, all right? Mature. Now empty the register now, turkey neck. Come on. And I want some of those fucking Tic Tacs and some cigarettes, biyatch. Not those fucking cigarettes. The other ones, scrotum face! Come on! - You shithead! - Be cool, old lady. Don't make me hurt you. Ow! Get out of here, you son of a bitch! You motherfucker! What the hell was that? Here, you're welcome. Hey, Chino, what the hell happened in there? You're bleeding pretty bad, man. I was just trying to be polite with the old lady, and she busted out with a damn machete, man. You dope. Can I help you? Only God can help me at this point. You're the religious one. In the joint we used to say, "God help me 'cause man won't." Well, out here we say God helps those who help themselves. So what you trying to say to me? You're the one who's staring. What are you looking at? Well, you kinda remind me of someone. You remind me of someone too. Someone I'd rather forget. Someone who gave you that black eye? Maybe. Anybody ever hurt you? Yes, ma'am. Sometimes you just don't see it coming. Hear that. The devil wears all kinds of disguises. Amen. Daddy, I got to wee-wee. Pull over, will you, Pike? I got to go too. That's far enough. Could you turn around, please? Oh, come on, princess. Nobody wants to look at your little tired ass peeing. - Come on. - Chino, turn around. Hey, Chino, turn around. Chino-- Oh! - You know anything about cars? - Yo, I'm Puerto Rican, right? Shit is-- Look at these injectors. I think they're clogged. Yeah, that's it. Die, motherfucker! Die, you little fucking cockroach. You just-- You just won't die, will you? You little fucking cockroach. You fucker. Fuck you, fuckhead. I thought we were all set, man. We are all set. I heard about your little téte-é-téte in the car. No. I don't know what you're talking about. Remember? Bound for Miami? Natalie? Oh, come on, man. What are you doing? Sure you wanna do that, man? Damn right I do, baby. I've waited my whole life for it. You know how many rounds you got in there? You're gonna give me the math homework now? - Do you remember Booker? - I'm right at your face. You better put it down. You see what I can see? Booker had how many? Two? Two for Book. And then how many did the cop got? Do you remember? - Can you remember? Go back. - Ah, for the cop. Chico, I'm right at your face. You better be right. Fuck off! You fucking pissy motherfucker! Chino! No, Chino! Who's unprofessional now, huh? Put the gun down! Fuck you, Pike! Fuck you. Going for less partners, huh, motherfucker? Making me think I'm your boy, and then you fucking sell me out when I was sleeping, motherfucker? Is that what you are, you Judas fucking bastard? Huh? We was boys, man. I went to your fucking house, and this is how you fucking treat me, you son of a fucking bitch? You know what you are? You're a piece of shit, man. I fucking hate you. Motherfucking piece of shit! That's what the fuck you are. You're not even a man. You're not even a fucking man. You're a piece of fucking shit. - You ain't gonna kill me, man. - Why the fuck did you do this, man? You ain't gonna kill me 'cause you don't know who the contact is. It's all up here. Fifteen million dollars. So you do what you got to do. God, I'm so sick of you telling me what to do, man. You're such a big shot, right? "I know the contacts. I'm such a big shot." You know what I wanna hear you say? I know what I want to hear-- You say-- Say, "Chino, I'm a fuckup." Go ahead, say it. Pike, say it, or I'm gonna fucking kill you! Say, "I'm a fuckup." I'm a fuckup, Chino. That's what I wanted to hear, man. Now tell me who the contact is. It's gonna be a fucking shame seeing your face... down in that ditch where that bitch was peeing. That's what's gonna be the fucking shame. Tell me who the contact is one more fucking time. - God forgive you. - Don't put those hands up, man. I hate to end it. Just put those fucking hands down, man. Don't fucking touch me, man. Fuck, man! Fuck! Ticklish. Ticklish. You okay? My family gets my share, right, Pike? Right? Look, when everything settles down, maybe we can go out. Hear from Rain Man lately? Natalie, you come with me. Do you believe in God? Yes, ma'am. I'm so fucked up, God's the only one who'll have me. See, how I look at it, when I got in the car with you guys, I just gave it up to God. You know? Deep. Yeah. Like maybe it was meant to be. Maybe he meant for us to meet that way. You know? Maybe we were just two people on a bad road. And we met, and we're supposed to make it right. Think that's corny? Honestly? I think that shit is corny. I think so too. Well, thanks. I'll be right back. Would you hug me? Maybe later. You mind if I come in? Man, you get the dope room, huh? That's not right. Check it out, man. Did you get to shit and shave? Do you feel a little better now, huh? Hobbs, what's the matter? Hobbs, you okay? You all right, man? Boo. Oh! Oh, you fuck. You're not looking too good, man. You know, I bet you're hurting and everything, so I'm just gonna keep this really short, all right'? I've been in my room thinking about stuff and about forgiveness. Does this have a point? Yeah. I just have to have it beaten into me, you know? Like you tried to do for me. And so I figured all the things that I needed to forgive you about, and I can do most of them. You fucking up the job, you know, all those stupid "you people" comments-- Mm-hmm. And then you trying to turn Pike against me... and cutting me out the deal. Gone. Forgiven. All right, bro? But you know what I can't forgive you for? Mmm. Yeah. Think about it. Hmm. It's a mystery. Oh, yeah. My brother. Hmm? My brother. Yeah. Yeah. Imagine. That's what it is. You know what's funny, man? Hmm? I could do anything to you right now. I could just take my dick out right now and slap it across your face. If you had one. Or I could shit on your face then. I could stuff toilet paper up your nose. Maybe take your shoes, shove 'em up your ass. Chino, Chino, I need to talk to you. Come closer. Come down here. Uh-- You miss me already? Hmm? You have... stink stank... spic breath. Sorry I had to be the one to tell you. - That's all you got to say? - Mmm-- Yeah. That's it. You sick bastard! Your miserable life! Fuck! Talk to me. Come on, big mouth. Talk to me. Come on, big mouth. I wanna hear it. Come on, say something. I can't hear you. I can't hear you, big mouth. What? [Gasping 1 Natalie ] Let's see what we have here. The winner! Where you want me to read you from? Do you like-- Do you like Genesis? Or something maybe from "Ecclesiastics"? "The wicked in his pride doth persecute the poor. Let them be taken in the devices that they have imagined." This is very appropriate to you. "For the wicked boasted of his heart's desire--" That's you. "...and blessed the covetous--" That's me. "...whom the Lord abhoreth." "Horror-- The wicked--" Sit down and shut up. I didn't say anything. Are you gonna come and sit down and shut up'? Come on. Please? Remember? Remember what we was talking about before? Was you serious about that? - About what? - About-- You know what I was talking about before. About you being my girl and all that. Remember? Oh. Chino, I told you. I just got out of a really bad situation. I'm not ready to get involved with somebody else. That's not what I'm talking about. I'm about to become a very rich man. Do you understand that? I'm gonna become a future millionaire. You're gonna be very successful at it too, Chino. - So you think I'm stupid too, don't you? - Mm-mm. All you-- all you motherfuckers think I'm stupid. But I'm not. I let you think that. I clocked you and Pike. I know what's going on. "Oh, yeah. Whassup, Pike, honey baby? Let's dump the spic in the hotel. Why didn't you off the little midget a little sooner?" I know-- Could you have-- Excuse me. Could you have the courtesy of fucking looking at me when I'm talking to you? Chino! You really think I'm interested in Pike? - Hell, yeah. - You're wrong. Why do you think I got in the car, huh? 'Cause you just needed help. You're using somebody. No. It's because of you. You're the man, Chino. Besides, I just can't get involved with somebody. I'm married and I'm Catholic. And I know you're Catholic too. You're not gonna get involved with a married woman. Not usually. But in your case, I'd definitely make an exception. Natalie ] Close your eyes. No. I'm not closing my eyes. Come on, baby. I-- I don't-- It's a surprise. I'm gonna peek eventually. Oh. This is a surprise. [Shouts 1 Happy now? Natalie! What happened? He just went too far. I'm gonna clean this up. Operator, get me the sheriff's office. Here we go. Here we go. This way. Fuck! Who fucked up? Yo, man. Watch the paintings. Fucking Chino. He took off his mask, and he blew away two guards. I told you I was fucking claustrophobic. I'm suffocating, all right? What were you thinking about, huh? What were you thinking about? Come on, come on. Come on. - Get down! - Book, shut the door! Hold it right there! Take us back up! Go! Now where the fuck is he? - Put it down, asshole! - Come on! - Come on, come on. - Let's go! Let's go! Fuck, it's coming, man! Crane! Left, right. Go left. Police emergency! Evacuate! Let's go, folks. Move it out of here. Police! Open the door! Come on, you've got to get out of here. Get the fuck back! I got a hostage! I swear to God, I'll fucking kill him! Get the fuck back! Put the gun down. Whatever it is you want, we can talk about it. Just back off, motherfuckers! I got a fucking hostage! Get back! Get the fuck back! I got a fucking hostage! Get the fuck back! I swear to God I'll fucking kill him! Move back! Put the gun down. Whatever it is you want, we can talk about it. Put the gun down. Fuck you! Fuck you. I want-- I want a Benz drop-top 50 with $40,000 in it... in 20s and 10s in the front seat. Do you hear me? And I want my brother taken out of the ment. state hospital-- Move, move! - All right, it's a kill. - [Man 1 Kill. Attack! Where to, boss? Don't know. But I know I'm gonna put away my past and start all over again. And I wanna start all over again with you. That would be nice. What would it be like? You know, we'd be the typical American family. You cook, you clean. I sleep. Yeah. Me Mandingo, you Jane. Yeah. We could take it real slow. Real slow. I'm gonna pull over. Good girl. Get out. What's up? I decided to keep the paintings for myself. But they're worthless. They're too hot. Yeah, well, I figured if you guys could get 15 million in Miami, I could probably get a million some place else, right? A million's good for me. - You mean this? - Mm-hmm. I really like you, Pike, but I just-- I don't know. I wanna start over. Just... clean. And I wanna do it by myself. Hey, Pike. Merry Christmas. Did that bitch think I'd let her point a loaded gun at me? Shit. Rm Shit. Hey, hold it right there! Let me see your hands. Don't move! Chino. After all the backstabbing, I sold the painting in Miami for a cool mil. I gave everyone's family their cut except for Chino. His brother wouldn't know what to do with it anyway.
