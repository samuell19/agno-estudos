Those that are in those marginalized groups, being told that they have these bugs, that they have these viruses and they need to be cleansed. But dirty computers don't see their bugs and their viruses as negatives. They see them as features, as attributes, something to be celebrated. My name is Jane 57821. I am a dirty computer. I am a dirty computer. I am ready to be cleaned. I am ready to be cleaned. So on the album you have three, three different stages. The first few songs represent the reckoning, you know realizing that hey, I represent to society a dirty computer. It's like the first time a black person is called a nigga, or the first time a woman is called a bitch by a man and having to reckon with what that means. And then you have the celebration towards the middle of the album where you have those songs like 'pynk' and 'make me feel' and 'django Jane' that's saying hey, despite being a dirty computer, despite what the world says about me, I'm going to celebrate my bugs, I'm going to celebrate my viruses. Y'know, I'm going to be the best fucking dirty computer I can be. And then when you get to a song like 'American', that's a part of the reclamation. That's saying that I am a dirty computer, but I too am American. You know my ancestors helped build this country. We worked hard - blood, sweat, and tears. And those are the stages, and so visually what we wanted to do was we wanted to create a story that allowed you to focus in on what it would mean to have those in the position of power erase your identity. When we were working on the music, we were envisioning this dystopian near-future um society, an America that had kind of succumbed to, I guess the worst impulses of our current president and it became something really sickening and dangerous. We were trying to figure out: How can we take the music, how can we take a film, how can we tell this like really cool story with these elements? We had come into the story with ummm seeing that Jane had been captured and put in this institution. So 'crazy classic life' is a memory. They're erasing her memory, so this is how we get to see what the outside world looks like. What her experience was before she got put in. The fact that these songs and this album and these concepts came along at this point in our history of this country was really gripping and poignant. We use that as fuel. With 'I like that' I was trying to accomplish making a video that really celebrated black girl magic. I kind of knew where she was going and what direction she was going in with her project before it even came out, and I wanted to kind of show that she was going to be stripping down a little bit and showing a little bit more of herself and being more vulnerable. The song is about embracing the things that make you unique even if it makes others uncomfortable. And so it was important to sort of exaggerate certain images to show that my world y'know how I see life umm is just slightly different, y'know it's, it's surreal. On one of our shoot days we umm, we shot with a umm, an actual peacock. So he started to take flight behind Janelle and she like freaked out and like ran off set and said she was done, basically like that was the end of the shoot day, but we got everything we needed so it was cool. ♪ It's like I'm powerful ♪ with a little bit of tender ♪ an emotional sexual bender With 'make me feel' I knew that I wanted to come out with a focus on duality. And 'make me feel' with the song and what it represents in terms of women's empowerment and agency over your body and image it was important to have clothing and dancing and just like performance that gave you the rawest sexy most unfiltered version of who I am. When Janelle put on that chain mask and she came out I was just blown away. Like that was my favorite outfit, and I had seen her practicing in rehearsal like how she was gonna interact with the guitar and things like that and I was like 'wow I can't wait to shoot that.' so I did 'make me feel' and 'django Jane' at the same time and I knew I wanted those to go together. What you don't know is there is a video for 'django Jane' that did not get released. 'Django Jane' was a ah an interesting come about. Uh very different than your average music video. Um I had been working with the team on 'dirty computer' and 'django Jane' was obviously like an essential keystone piece of the project. And they shot a really cool video with a great team, but uh as many of us in the music video world know visual effects are time consuming and expensive and the 'django Jane' video was initially entirely green screen, so as deadlines were coming and I was kind of tracking along with the video and watching progress there was this moment where you realize there was no chance of finishing it in its original form. We didn't have an idea for django until Sunday morning before our Monday evening shoot. So in the span of three and a half, maybe four days we wrote the video, shot the video, edited the video, colored the video and upload it and it was just a total whirlwind of a process. ♪ Pink like the inside of your baby ♪ ♪ Pink behind all of the doors crazy ♪ The infamous vagina pants, the labia pants, the flower pants. They have so many names. I was actually calling them the coochie pants at first, but then everybody just calls them vagina pants and I guess that's what they are, so a friend of mine who is a designer Duran Dontick, he uhh made some sketches and sent them over to Janelle and I think Janelle had a really clear idea of what she wanted from them as well so she sent notes back and then he sent a new version and kind of went back and forth and he flew in the night before ahhh we were gonna shoot this scene and uhh came to the desert with these pants and put them on her and the dancers and made some adjustments and yeah we shot the next day. Doing the fitting I was like I can't believe it. I just kept opening my legs, closing them, open them, close them. I mean, they're very fun. There's some women in the 'pynk' video that don't have on the pants because one of the things we wanted to say is that you don't have to have a vagina to be a woman. You don't have to look like her to be respected and so umm for us we wanted to just showcase the diversity. We wanted to be as inclusive as possible, uhhh and we also wanted, yeah we, we wanted to do something fun. It took two, two and a half years probably to make this thing and during that time there was probably a good ten times that all of us were throwing in the towel, it's not happening, it's not gonna happen, it's over. The label was, you know, emailing us, we're costing so many people money. I'm spending money, we're spending money as wonderland. Oh it was stressful, but it really, really happened the way it was supposed to. I kind of walked away with this, this feeling of pride that, y'know we're able to make this content, we're able to show these different sides of humanity and show there's beauty in the imperfections So I think there are some really, really, really heartbreaking moments. One in particular is when Tess is walking me down the hall and I'm going to get my last dose of nevermind and y'know I'm basically gonna become a torch. And I just remember when we were doing that scene it was just, uh, painful, just going through it and just thinking about what it would really mean to lose your identity. To have, have two actors that already know each other really helps, 'cause we didn't have rehearsals. Tessa was a trooper. She was filming Westworld, she was filming another movie, and she was with us. And her schedule was bananas. When it was time for her to like forget me and to be like a torch, she was very convincing to the point that I was just like, "this is, this is next level." It's as if she remembers me, like really knows me. She tells me things about myself, about where I'm from. She says that my name was zen. It's just kinda crazy, 'cause it all lived, it all lived and died in that one day where like we're either going to have a great day today and this thing is gonna make it, or if we have a horrible day today this whole project is gonna be crazy. The last scene was that hallway scene, and we knew by that time that if it was gonna work it was going to really have to come together, and um they did it they, it really came together and they really did. It was important that I was working with women on this project, and black women in particular and Lacey Duke was one of my first picks to work with. She knows my music, she knows me as a person, as an artist and we would just have great conversations around art and around the importance of making sure that our stories are told and we had so much fun. Emma Westonburg, um I love her. I saw her work online through a friend and I was just blown away. When she sent the treatment over for 'pynk' I was like you ma'am, your mind is crazy, let's do this. I love working with Andrew as well, uhh he came through. I'm telling you like Andrew came through. We were able to connect over this story, over what it meant to be a dirty computer, how important it was to create something that dirty computers could feel umm seen by, you know celebrated and loved. Chuck lightning really did help bring this story together and write it up and make sure that all of our ideas were there. Chuck knows me best because we did the album together, so he knew the integrity of the project. Nate Wonder and Wynne Bennett putting them in the room as producers umm on this project was just incredible. I would just watch them take so many amazing like new and interesting synth sounds and like they exceeded my expectations. Alan Ferguson has been around since like the Genesis of us making visuals. He did 'many moons' and he's believed in me umm when nobody on the visual side even knew who I was. He said, "I'll do this." Like he's put in a lot of blood, sweat, and tears like us. The ambition for it. Wanting to push the boundaries. I really respected that. Y'know I really hope the film kind of shows there is a world out there and there is a community and there is a rebellion that you can be a part of. And you don't have to fall into line with the way that you're supposed to be. I think we all believed in the message so much. You know that we just wanted to help, so it really didn't matter you know if who had the idea, at the end of the day everybody was pitching in to make sure that we could make this emotion picture umm and Janelle's vision come um to life and be as great as it could possibly be. It was great to work with Janelle and her wonderland team. She and her team really have fun in collaborating and in actually in the making of and I think that is uhhh what makes beautiful stuff, and that is worthwhile as well. What I'm learning throughout this process is like, freedom is not free. It comes with a price. It comes with great sacrifice and I'm realizing that more and more and more as I've done this project and I've put out these visuals. I'm just thankful y'know to be able to have an outlet, to be able to have songs, to be able to have visuals a story that allows me, even in my darkest hours, even in my most insecure moments, in my most vulnerable moments that I can put on 'dirty computer' and you know I can reconnect with who I am and, and what I am, and be proud of my dirt and be proud of where I come from and I can find myself again. ♪ I pledge allegiance to the flag ♪ ♪ Learned the words from my mom and dad ♪ ♪ Cross my heart and I hope to die ♪ ♪ With a big ol' piece of American pie ♪ ♪ Love me baby, love me for who I am ♪ ♪ Fallen angels singing, "clap your hands" ♪ ♪ Don't try to take my country, I will defend my land ♪ ♪ I'm not crazy, baby, naw ♪ I'm American, I'm American ♪ ♪ I'm American, I'm American ♪ seventy-nine cent to your dollar ♪ ♪ All that bullshit from white-collars ♪ ♪ You see my color before my vision ♪ ♪ Sometimes I wonder if you would fly would it help you make a better decision? ♪ ♪ I pledge allegiance to the flag ♪ ♪ Learned the words from my mom and dad ♪ ♪ Cross my heart and I hope to die ♪ ♪ With a big ol' piece of American pie ♪ ♪ Just love me baby, love me for who I am ♪ ♪ Fallen angels singing, "clap your hands" ♪ ♪ Don't try to take my country, I will defend my land ♪ ♪ I'm not crazy, baby, naw ♪ I'm American, I'm American ♪ ♪ I'm American, I'm American ♪ let me help you in here ♪ until women can get equal pay for equal work ♪ ♪ This is not my America ♪ until same gender loving people can be who they are ♪ ♪ This is not my America ♪ until black people can come home from a police stop ♪ ♪ Without being shot in the head ♪ ♪ This is not my America ♪ until poor whites can get a shot at being successful ♪ ♪ This is not my America ♪ I can't hear nobody talkin' to me ♪ ♪ Just love me baby, love me for who I am ♪ ♪ Fallen angels singing, "clap your hands" ♪ ♪ Don't try to take my country, I will defend my land ♪ ♪ I'm not crazy, baby, naw ♪ I'm American, love me baby Action! ♪ I'm American, love me for who I am, fallen angels ♪ Let's go. ♪ Until Latinos and latinas don't have to run from walls ♪ ♪ This is not my America ♪ but I tell you today that the devil is a liar ♪ ♪ Because it's gon' be my America before it's all over ♪ ♪ Please sign your name on the dotted line ♪
