The target for today is quite high, it's five euro per passenger. So, I would like you to really put 100% efforts in selling as much as you can. So, good trolley display, so you put a lot of beers put them on ice so they're cool. Just one remark, I know that in Tenerife they do, they sale fairly. Do we do the same, or it's each our own sales? What do you think about that? I heard that they do that in Tenerife, so... Honestly, I never did this way. I mean, because they consider maybe it's not fair. Mm. So, I don't wanna hear about other bases, things, okay? What we need to do here is push the sales individually, okay? So, you girls you work, you work as a team but you work on your own as well, okay? So each of you has a device and each of you needs to sell as much... - Okay, so we keep on the procedures? - Yes. ZERO FUCKS GIVEN Ladies and gentlemen, my colleague is gonna pass with our gift service. We have a wide range of products today on board, such as refreshments and various gifts. We have a special promotion for you on women's perfume, especially available with 20% discount. For selected items we have the 50% discount. You have both, and this one you can travel with it which is pretty good. - Yes. - Yes. - This one. - You want this one? You want some make-up with it? - You want make-up? - No. This one only. - Okay, 50 euro. - Okay. - If you want it. - Yes, okay. So, one. Here you go. It's 30 euro, please. Thank you. Thanks. Bye. Bye. You know, sometimes the perfume defines exactly who you are. It's the final touch, yes? - That's why you should try it. - When it go wrong, so I like to keep to the person that... that I am and I believe that perfume defines me a little bit. Good girl! That's what I like to put upon myself, is being the good girl! The good girl, but this one is better because this one is called Irr√©sistible. I prefer to be the irresistible one than the good girl. - Have a good day. - Thank you, goodbye. Thank you, goodbye. - Goodbye. - Goodbye. Bye. Bye. Bye. - Thank you. - Goodbye. Bye. You should have checked before on the website. Sorry, ma'am, normally I always go by this air... company and I always take this bag and normally it's not... - With Wings? - Yes, normally it's not a problem. Okay, I'm not sure because today it doesn't fit. So, how do you wanna pay? I'm sorry, I really, I don't have that money, but... I really need to take this airplane, it's my brother's birthday, he's turning 18. So I really want to be there. Okay, I understand, but I have no other solution. Maybe you can call someone to find the money? You have I think half an hour or 20 minutes... if you want to find a solution. - I'm gonna board the other passengers. - Can I just... Excuse me, can I have your boarding pass, please? Can I just take it with me on the plane? No, we check for safety reasons. Can I see your boarding pass, please. Thank you. Can I check your IDs, please? It's okay like this. Thank you, sir. - Have a good flight. - Thank you. You know, I really need... I really need to be on this airplane. Yeah, I understand but I really need to follow the rules. Hi, ma'am. Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, we are starting our descent to Lanzarote airport. We'll be landing in approximately ten minutes. Please make sure to go back to your seat, your seatbelt securely fastened, your armrest down, your window blind open. Also, any belongings will need to be stowed underneath the seat in front of you. Mobile phones and tablets, they need to be placed in fight mode until... - You've got the mollies on you? - I called the guy. Call him! Call him. I sent him a message. He said he'd be here in an hour. An hour? It's Spain! Can you buy me a drink? But I'm full of love, you see! I want to cry, I want to be happy and at the same time, I... Come on, it's the drug. I want a bit of everything... I wanted to tell you earlier... when I told you... You and me... We can... Sorry. - I said it like that... - I'd prefer a "Let's go home together" than a "I'm looking for love". But I am really looking for it! - No! - Yes! You're looking for it... like looking for your phone... - It stresses me out! - I just want to... you know... It's the drug, Arthur! The drug! Move your... your big sticky feet! If I throw up, it'll be like a stream. Get your hand off. It's fine! Make me some noodles. - Make you some "poodles"? - Noodles with ketchup and cheese. - I'm begging you... - Ah, I thought you said "poodles". - Yeah, sure... - No, it's OK. I'll make some... noodles with ketchup? All right, let's go! You prefer to live with a Smarties... like, you're married for life... like, forever... and every time you say "I'm in a relationship", he pops up. Or, or... Or, instead... When you... You put your keys in the keyhole to lock and open your door at home... there is... acid... rain that falls... like 2 km from your home. - So it can fall on anyone. - Acid rain. - Would you rather kill people? - No! Maybe... well. I dunno. I'd go out with the Smarties. - Would you rather... - Not bad. Have rubber arms so you can't hug anyone and everything is soft, like marshmallow arms. Or, would you rather have 19 nipples? I would rather have... - Nineteen nipples. - Nineteen? But that means the first time you're shirtless in front of a woman... - Shit... - So do you announce it? Shit... It'll come out. - That'll come out? How? - Well it's... It's vodka. I'd rather have 19 nipples because I can hide them. Like, I can put hair on them or something. - It'd be nice to get a little... - A little what? - To get 19 nipples fondled like... - I'm going to throw up! Like a guitar. My mother had to see a client that my father had to see. So she took his car. - Yeah. - And... So she took his car to go to this meeting. But to get to this meeting, she had to go through a roundabout. It's a roundabout that's a bit out of our town, but she was used to going through it. And... on this roundabout, there are some decorations. You see... little walls, propellers... which where a bit all over the place. And... when she drove in, she crashed into the roundabout. So... she died on impact? Just like that, instantly? When someone called me... she was dead, so... I think so. For example, my mum... It's unbearable right now. To see her age, to know that... there's a process that's started that... I'm going to have to witness her decline. It's really the end of a... It's human decadence. She is just very... hardcore with us. In... In simple phases... When she's just at the table, she'd rub her hands together like this before eating, looking at all of us like... It's frightening! I don't know... She's taking us into her long-term depression. And... I love her very, very much. I mean, to see... let people live to be old... that you have to be there for that. I mean... There's no going back. And instead of having to witness... this downward spiral. Maybe it's better to just hit a wall. Suzanna? Sylvia? - Yes? - Can you please finish the turnaround checks? We don't have much time, okay? Here's the rubbish, just pass through the cabin with the rubbish, collect everything. Okay? Thank you very much. Okay, girls, hurry up, ten minutes, passengers almost here. - Where did you find this? - 16. Four minutes left, four minutes left. I need you all super, super fast, we need to clean up and go. Attention number three, thank you. And you didn't shave again. Come on, you're the only one who can see it. No, everybody can see that you always have the attention of the whole cabin. On you. But it's okay, I don't care. - No, you don't care? - No. - Oh. - You're the only one caring. Yeah, I do care because I don't want to report because you didn't shave. It's okay. No, it's not okay. If we get a report, all of us, because you didn't shave, it's two minutes shaving. Do you think they can report you 'cause you're speaking so much? No, that is not on the report list. Hi. You have to set the game. - No. - Yes. - Hello! - Hi. DEREK - SEE PROFILE OR RESPOND And you think these are good conditions? I don't know. I need to work so I work. You need to work, and it's a great job but not in such conditions. - Look at how other companies are! - Conditions... It's always the same. There are always imperfections. Do you know the working conditions in other companies? If for example, if you're sick, do you get paid? I don't know, I try not to be sick. I watch out for myself. - I drink vodka. - I think it's really time to act! And it's phenomenal that this strike is going on all over Europe. - Where are you based? - I don't know. In Lanzarote, but I don't really have time to make the revolution. You know, guys, maybe we should be with you, I agree with that. We're going to be late. But we're gonna miss our flight and we don't wanna get in trouble with this, so... Yeah, I understand that, but... try to think for the next strike, okay? Yeah, of course, I get it. And it's a good thing that you have some people... It's only when we work together we can change something, so it's important that everybody supports the cause. Go and talk to your colleagues! Some of your colleagues in Lanzarote are on strike too. Go and see them. They'll explain it to you. I'm sure that if we don't do anything things will get worse. Yeah, but I don't really believe in change... We're not the same age so what we can sacrifice isn't the same. Don't believe in change? Meaning? It means I have a flight and I'd like to take it. What about the future? I don't even know if I'll be alive tomorrow, so I just want to get on my flight. Tea, coffee, snacks. Tea, coffee? Snacks? Anything to eat, anything to drink? Tea, coffee, snacks? Tea, coffee? Would you like some coffee? Some tea? Anything to drink, anything to eat? Tea, coffee, snacks? Are you okay? Are you okay or not? Why don't you respond? About what? - Are you all right? - Yes, I'm fine and you? What you gonna do today? Nothing. As always. Are you gonna stay here the whole day? Maybe. Always maybe. Are you gonna go to the beach with me today? I'm gonna go later on if you want to come. If you're going later, maybe I go with you. Maybe is not an answer for me. You need to answer yes or no. Like everyone else. I have to shave. Yeah, but me too. That is no excuse. Okay. I'll go with you. Okay, cool. Shit... David here. Look, I'm getting in contact with you because rostering have said to me that we have a lack of people over the Christmas period. I know you already have the hours for the month, but I need to know if you could be able to work these hours. I do need an answer as soon as possible, but obviously this is just a proposal, I mean, you're not obliged to do anything, but please come back to me as soon as possible. Thanks. Yes, it's okay for me, David. Stop staring, they will see you. They will never watch me. If I continue like this, they will see you. Beautiful like on their picture, you know. Yeah, it's a little bit... too beautiful. Yeah, like the white stuff. I don't like it. How do you work with it always in your face? Honestly, I could be dressed like nothing for working in the air conditioning. I prefer to go home in the same bed, same parking, same boyfriend, you know. - Everything the same? - Yeah. You don't get bored? It's okay for me. Don't mind. I don't think, it's not for me, always change, places like this. Yeah, but at least they're going to real destination. You see what I mean? They're going to Puerto Rico, they're going to Costa Rica, they're going to Tokyo, they're going everywhere. Where are we going? Watch. I found an account where they all tag. And it's all their experiences in Dubai, all the Emirates, Caribbean. Yeah, it's beautiful but it's still Instagram, you know. Yeah, but still, that's a landscape. The light, and it's not just about images and stuff, it's just you, you can restart everything, it's... I don't know, it's a new life. Hey, Dad asks if you'll be back for Christmas. I don't know if you have plans or not. See you. No, I won't be here for Christmas or New Year's. I'm working at the time. I couldn't postpone. I tried everything but they said no. Couldn't you have at least tried to get off? Well... It's fine. I just told you I tried but it didn't work. Ladies and gentlemen, captain speaking from cockpit. We just landed in Bordeaux a bit behind schedule due to slow turn around, we do apologise for this delay. The ground temperature is ten degrees Celsius. Weather is raining and we hope to see you soon on board Wings and have a nice stay in Bordeaux. Bye-bye. You wanna take a shower? No. I prefer to stay like this. Okay. But can you stay with me? Please. Just five minutes. You have the same... You like it? Mm-hm. And you're coming often here? Mm-mm. No. There was... trouble at the airport so I had a layover. But usually I come home... every night. I think I have to go. Whoa. Closer again. No, come on. Would you like some coffee? Again. - Would you like some coffee? - Okay, you smell alcohol. Yes or not? I don't know. You don't know? You don't know if you drink or smell of alcohol? - Make a party yesterday? - No. No...? No, I didn't feel so good, so... - So? - So, I had one glass. Ah, okay. - Only one? - Yes. Timing? 12 hours before your flight, or...? After? You don't know the timing? You have to respect the time. Anyway, don't take care of the time, you don't have to drink before your flight, it's better. Because, honestly, you cannot fly today. No, I swear I can fly. You can fly but if you have alcohol, if we have a control anyway, for me, I have to call someone. No, no, eat some candies or chewing gum and I can do the sale and the services. I can do everything. Honestly, I really don't know. I like you, you're good, you look nice, but you smell of alcohol, so... We're health and safety before commercial parts. But... I mean, you can do any test and you will see I'm good. I make my test and the test is not good. - No... - You smell alcohol. You can't work for me. Sorry. I swear I can fly. Your life jacket is stowed in a pocket beneath your seat where you can pass it around your head. In the unlikely event of landing in water, remove the jacket from its packet and place it over your head. Bring the strap around your waist at the front and secure as the crew are now demonstrating. To inflate, pull sharply on the red toggle. There is a mouthpiece for further inflation or deflation and a light to attract attention. - It's on the top. - Yeah. Here we go. Okay. Here you go. Do you mind to take another one, please? - Oh, yeah. - Sorry! No problem. Twinkle of the Christmas tree. Yeah. - One year. - One year? And you? - Six months. - I'm six months as well. I'm still the baby in the base. And I think the uniform fits perfect, no? I don't know. - You like it? Looks very nice. - Yeah. Yeah, your shirt is very white. You can see it didn't have many washes. And you? How long do you have working? It's coming to... I have to watch on my Instagram. It's almost three years. - Wow. - Two and a half years. Great. Looks long. Very long. Sorry. I left staff with my bag somewhere. Yeah, she said that she left it over there in the corner for you. Ah, great. Before you do go anywhere, we need to speak about your contract. - Okay? - Okay. If you just wanna come over here, we'll have a quick talk about it if you can. Have you finished? - Yeah. I'll come. - Okay, I'll see you there in a second. So, I'm sure you're aware your contract is about to finish now, okay? So, due to the contract being about to finish, unfortunately there's no vacancies for juniors here in the base. So you'll have to do the number one course. But I'm good as a junior. I mean, I don't want be number one or... I mean, I like responsibility, but I'm really good where I am. Okay, I understand what you're saying to me, however unfortunately I just can't give you that option. So, in the base there are a certain amount of vacancies for juniors and your contract's about to finish. As it's about to finish, the only alternative I can give to you is to do the number one contract. Okay, otherwise I can't do anything? Unfortunately there's, I just can't give you another solution. Unless you do this, your contract will be finished and you'll be terminated. Okay. Then tell me what to do, I will do it. Okay, you need to take this opportunity as an opportunity for you to be able to grow, okay? Okay, so basically I just need you to sign something. What was your name again? Cassandre. - Okay, Cassandre... - Wassels. Okay, yeah, here you are, perfect. Okay. Hello? Hello Mrs Wassels, this is Sabrina from Orange. Could you spare me a moment to talk about your phone consumption? I saw that you were on a hummingbird plan and I see that your data consumption was mainly abroad. So I wanted to suggest the cheetah plan which would allow you to have unlimited downloads abroad. Would you be interested in that? What's the difference in cost to the one I have now? That's a difference of fourteen euros and ninety cents. And then you'll have unlimited data. Then you won't get blocked when you use up your data. All right, I'll take it. I'd like to change my plan. However, it has to be the account holder who does the modification so I will ask you for some information. You are Sabine Wassels... No, it's my mother. Okay, then your mother needs to go online and make the necessary changes. She can either do so from her mobile application or online. The procedure is simple, she clicks on "Document" on the "Add New Document" tab and then she will be able to allow you to make the change on her behalf. Then you can change the phone plan. Would that be okay? No, that's complicated. Well, another solution would be for your mother to call the customer service directly herself. It's going to be really complicated because she's dead. I... I understand. What we can do is resend you the code so that you have access... Well, maybe the best thing would be... to cancel the line. - All right. - And your name? Cassandre Wassels. What I can suggest at this point is to cancel the subscription - so you can create a new one. - All right. Very well. However, the cancellation fee will cost 43 euros which you'll have to pay in order to reopen a line in your name. - Will that be fine? - All right. - Great. I'll let you do the modification. - Thank you. - Thank you for being a valued customer. - Goodbye. Stay focused. Ladies and gentlemen, welcome on board this Wing flight destination to Malaga. I am Jakob and I am your cabin manager. Keep it up. Let's start again. It's okay. - Your announcement was good. - It's incredible how... - It's shaking. - Started shaking. Yes, because it's a muscle. You need to practice your smile. Okay, 30 seconds is not a long time. - No, not at all. - And... your smile was very little, very close. You need to open yourself more, you need to be more confident, even the tone of your voice was a little bit shy. So, think about leadership. Think about good leaders, about the speech, how you... are going to let your passengers know that you are in charge. - You ready? - Yep. Ladies and gentlemen, welcome on board this Wing flight, destination to Malaga. I'm Dounia and I am your cabin manager. Okay. All those emotions you have, you need to leave it behind. Okay. Don't think about your personal life, don't think about anything which might disturb you, just focus and it's all about those 30 seconds, there's nothing else. Yeah. The question is to be here now, so there is no past, there is no future, it's just you as a cabin manager in this precise moment and here in front of you nobody cares about your personal life, or your personal issues or what you did yesterday or this morning or what you gonna do tomorrow. Welcome on board. You will find yourself at least twice a month facing a medical emergency. This is serious, you are trying to save someone. Take it seriously. You're gonna break his bones by now. Slower. Hey, I hope you have champagne on board! - Welcome. - Thank you. We want to know if there is champagne or caipirinhas? Can we have some right now? Not now exactly because we have... Oh, but we're on a bachelorette party. Yeah, I know. I'm going to get married. Oh, congratulations. - You just have to wait 20 minutes... - Show her your ring. Oh, it's beautiful, right? When you've got group of people travelling like that, it's always easier to deal just with one person than with a group. - Okay? - Yeah. Try to find the leader and get the leader on your side. So, what's very important regarding the body language in that case? What do you think, what's the first thing? Eye contact. Always put yourself in the passenger's shoes, you know, how you would like to be treated. This is very important because it shows empathy. You know? And always remember that the uniform is the wall between you, your emotions, your feelings, and what's going on. Yeah, never let you... go... to the limits. Don't let yourself be consumed, yeah? - Yes. - It's very important. Brace! Brace! And unbuckle your seatbelt and go down. Get out! Get out! Stop! Stop! Wait! Wait! Go! Go! In fact, the plan is simple. I've just finished a year at Wing. I'll be a cabin manager. After that, I'll try out for Emirates. - I get into Emirates... - Emirates is tough. I get into Emirates, - spend 3-4 years in Dubai... - OK, but... Yes, it's the perfect plan but... - How many languages can you speak? - Four. That's why. It's impossible for me. They'll never take me. - It's not as easy as that! - So, you've already given up! - Well, no, but... - You don't even apply. That's that. It's not that... - Do you want to or not? - Of course I do! You don't think it's my dream to be walking around Dubai with a tiger? - Well, if you want to... - Or to have a dolphin in my jacuzzi? If you want to have a dolphin and a tiger, then go for it! But you have to be more of everything! You have to be more beautiful, more smiley, more chic, and classier. Everything is more complicated. It's not Wing, you know! Compared to them, we're... - Great! You got your life on lock. - We're yokels. That's nice! It's great being young! No, but I'll try... but I'm sure it won't work out. They're too... they're too strict on language skills, I'm telling you! They have thousands of applications of people speaking seven languages. I'll walk in and speak a little English and... I will never pass. You want me to tell you what I think it's all about? - It's not the language or whatever. - It's hope. No, it's not hope! Stop talking like a grandma! It's gallantry! That's worse! You talk like a grandma's grandma! So gallantry means energetic? Just fake it! Fake having confidence and everyone thinks you're hot shit. Thank you. Jade. - Congratulations. - Thank you. Malin. - Congratulations. - Thank you. Cassandre. Congratulations. Well done. And Dounia. Well done. It was really cool to have you here. You're pretty motivated and you know where you're going, you all ave your targets set up. You're gonna be good cabin managers. - Thank you. - Thanks. Thanks. You can save one euro. By card? My colleague will take your payment. One soup. There is tomato soup or chicken soup. - Chicken. - Chicken soup. I have this. Yeah, but it's for them. I give him one and after... How was your fight, flight? - My fight? - Flight! It was almost a flight, it was Milano, Liverpool. Liverpool the worst. I hate it. Nothing new, drunk people. - Crusts. - No. Yeah. - Liverpool. - And many winters for sure. Half an hour to disembark. These people. I mean, they are cute but sometimes... It's harm! Anything else? Anything happened? We didn't fly today so we need... I meet someone, someone great. - Really? - He asked me if I want to get child. No, nothing in Liverpool. Like, Liverpool, really? It's like you found a unicorn on board, no? I will leave everything hidden somewhere there, you know. And that's what people say, everyone has a dead body in the fridge, no? - Yeah. - I think my dead body can stay there a bit longer. Are you happy? All the time. Cheers for that. Cheers. Yesterday I saw a girl, she had a tattoo in here saying "Happiness is inside me." - So, yeah... - Also! I don't think the happiness is in the wine or in somewhere else. How's it going? Great, and you? Well, not so good, after checking your reports, I've gone back through all your reports, and I'm comparing your reports to all the other number ones, and you have an average scoring of your crew of 4.5. - Yes. - Yet the rest of the base has 3.4 stars. So, I'm trying to understand exactly how you have come to this determination of this evaluation. You think I put too much stars, that's the trouble? No, what I'm saying is that 4.5 stars is basically telling me everything is perfect and there's absolutely no problems. Because most of the time I really trust my crew and they are doing well. Okay, I don't believe that for a second. For example, you have a flight here which is Madrid to Frankfurt, you had a terrible flight, terrible day of sales. True, I remember. You've given everyone a very good four stars. Yeah, because they deserve it because, to be honest, I really remember the flight and it wasn't about them. There was a lot of turbulence, we stopped two times, we tried two times to do it, duty free, - so it really wasn't their fault, so... - Okay. Why aren't you telling me this information? Why don't I know what's happening? At the end of the day, everything seems perfect... Because you're asking me to be not fair, just to reach out your objective. No, I'm not asking to reach to my objective, what I'm asking is for you to be objective and what I want you to do is your job. I want you to make sure you're evaluating people, because your obligation is to make sure that the crew are pushing themselves. There is a lady at 17 that, she doesn't want to move but she needs to move. Could you speak with her? She doesn't speak English. 17. We're about to take off, please can I see your boarding pass? You're 20C, it's just right there, can you go to your seat, please? I don't understand what you're saying. For safety reason, please go... You have to go to your seat, please. Either you go to your seat or I will disembark you. Please go to your seat right now. Either you go or I disembark you, please go to your seat. You're putting everyone late. This one. Okay. 20C. Here. Are you okay? I'm sorry for the window, but it was for safety request. You understand? And next time you should check on the website, you can choose window or... An operation? You're going alone? It's gonna be okay. It's the first time you're leaving your country for an operation, right? Where, the operation? Okay. How old is she? It's you? It's gonna be okay. You're gonna see them again, I'm sure. You're cute in this one. You want something to drink? To drink? Yeah. What do you like? You like vodka, wine? Take off your jacket, please. Thank you. Goodbye. Thank you. Forget Emirates. In Dubai for a month now, working for a private jet company. Send in your CV, they're hiring like crazy! I grab you a beer, but you calm down, okay? - But you calm down. - I am calm! - Get me a beer. - No, you're not. I am calm. This is the problem on these low cost... By card or by cash? Cash or card? I paid for my seat, I paid for my luggage, paid for priority boarding... Card or cash, sir? Have to pay for a smile as well, do I? Please, sir, card or cash? Go on, give us a smile, I'm sure you're quite nice when you smile. Card or cash? Card or cash. Give us a smile! You're nothing, are you? You work for a shitty little company. Shitty little company and a shitty little job. Okay, but you used your card and you purchased alcohol. I mean, two things that you shouldn't have done. Tell me, I need to understand this. I told you. Yeah, but to go against a company policy because you determined that you could purchase the alcohol for her. This is totally illogical. If it was water it would be the same situation, right? No, because you went against a company policy. You know full well that you're supposed to not use your credit card, you're not allowed to use your credit card. So what should I do? Well, the first thing, as you should know, which is in your manual, is that you need to comfort the passenger, you need to see what's wrong with them. I did it. And where does it say in the manual that you needed to buy them alcohol? I don't know, it doesn't say in the manual what I should do with people who look deeply sad. You need to use your common sense, you put yourself in danger, you put the rest of your crew in danger. This is totally unacceptable. At the end of the day, this has consequences. You know you shouldn't have done this. Who made the report against me? That's irrelevant. This is the situation that you're in now. Okay. Okay, well, due to this, unfortunately it's been determined that you'll be transferred from this base. Where? Still to be determined 'cause we don't have any vacancies in other airports. When the vacancies arise you'll have a transfer. But when I would know my reassignment? We don't have that information. You're, you're... listen to me, you're lucky that you have this, 'cause you have very good sales. It's the same job with more responsibilities... It's not the same thing. I manage the people I work with. And before I was under people's orders. The job is what you do. You bring coffees and whatnot. - OK? - Fine. She's managing and making the decisions. And we're not just serving coffee. If it's only serving coffee, I'd work at Starbucks, you see? That's not what I meant... For example, how many cabin managers are there? We are in the air. There's maybe 30,000 in the company. - And how many planes, for example? - Damn it, I don't know! - Dad, you're pretending not to get it! - No! - Yes, you are! - It's... Dad, you're my boss but we do the same job. - Well... No. - He does it on purpose. It's not that... Yes, I manage a bit more - but I have more experience. - I'm cleaning up. Well, that's good! But you agree with me in the end you still do things with more responsibilities, but... - the job is the same, no? - No. - It's not that I don't get it. - Yes, you do. Anyway, when you did... You got in there, because you wanted to travel, and that's good. So you should continue with it. No, I think it's good but... - Because you said it was a promotion. - In reality it's a very simple... It's not a promotion because it's based on a competition! For example, if there's a... a passenger who gets furious it's you who has to decide how to handle it. Yes, so do I call the police, do I get him out, - if someone has a stroke... - A stewardess can't. But the captain has to take care of that. Yes, but I don't want to be the pilot of the plane. I'm the boss of... the flight attendants. You are a stewardess. A stewardess plus more. It's not "plus more", it's chief attendant. Line manager? - Cabin manager! - Cabin manager. I don't need that, Dad. It's not just for you, it's for the pillows too. If you gave me another day I could have sorted it out but you didn't warn me... It's not that, it's that... Because I had to store away all the agency's archives, they were in the garage, and there's no room now with the pickup. So I put them in your room. Pardon. What's up? Very well. So it's 279,500 euros... Yes, it is 79,500, exactly. For the land registry, I could give it to you at the visit but as it's a second visit there won't be too many issues. Exactly. And this time, you'll be with your husband. Okay. So we'll say Wednesday at 2pm, and it'll be with me. I bought it second hand from a friend of mine who wanted to get a new car. It's a Mercedes, so it's solid. And parking isn't a problem? That's not why I got it. I got it because it's indestructible. If you drive into a tree, the tree falls over. And... it's a question of social standing. When the customers see you arrive, you stand out differently. - Well, it's true. - That's funny. Well, we are in a business of image. And you dress like that when you see clients? I'm a bit more relaxed now. Some clients in the countryside like it when I dress like this. I know I have to adapt to the client. And... When farmers see me in my leather jacket they trust me straight away. If I show up with my suit, they don't trust me. But when we have to deal with real estate operations, it's a suit. That's what sales is, knowing who you're dealing with to reassure them. And the pickup plays a part in this. When I arrive, they say, "Wow, it works!" It reassures them. The pickup is reassuring. It's impressive! It may not be easy to park but... I like being higher. You can see the road better and you're above others. What are you doing? Why are you here? Are you OK? - Weren't you sleeping? - No. Do you want some herbal tea? What are you checking? When I get up, I check that the door is closed. - Do you often get up at night? - No, it's just that... I'm used to getting up early for work. I'm ready by 4am in the morning. That's what I usually do. What time is it? It's 4:20. So where are we going afterwards? We're going to Moulin de Soli√®res! - Moulin de Soli√®res still exists? - Of course! - Wow! - The old bearded bouncer's still there. - Gandalf! - Gandalf! You put your feet in and it gets hot. - I swear! - Seriously? I brought these for you girls, but I'll let you choose the smells. I saw some real French shops so I thought of you girls. - What's this? - Many different body creams and stuff. - That's so nice! - No worries! - These are samples? - No, they're mini bottles, but they do look like a spray for a day. - So yeah... - So nice! It's never really too hot like in Marrakech. Yeah, it's true it's windier than in Marrakech. That's so cool! You must have seen some beautiful places! Yeah, I'm lucky. I've been all over Europe. And a bit of Africa too! Were you able to get around? - And have you seen all the countries? - I didn't always have time to visit. A fortnight ago, in the same week, I went to Milan, Mykonos, Essaouira... - and then we went back to Lanzarote. - Not bad. - What? You don't want to do that? - Yeah, tomorrow... - And we do it well... - Yes, but my sister is right there! - It's fine. - What do you mean? Cassandre! I already had sex with your sister. You annoy me! You talking like this stresses out my dad. Come on, your dad loves me! He's my friend and she even knows it! - It's only right now. - Stop putting on your show! I'm sorry, I'm sorry! Don't worry about it... You're better behaved when you're in front of Jean. - He scares me! - Really? - Yeah, he's so... - But our dad is a softy! Really? - I don't know, he seems a bit strict! - No! No, he can come off a bit... He's actually quite shy. - We were never spanked! - Yes, you were! You don't remember... I remember... Even I've been spanked by your father too! It should be called a dish "Jean's spankings.". - Don't you want to settle down sometimes? - Yeah, but every day is different, I never get bored and I meet different people all the time. In the same day, I can see snow and sun. I'm rather lucky! So you're not attached to anyone? No, nobody. - Really not? - Nope. Why are you travelling if you don't meet anyone? I meet people and I have flatmates but I have to accept that I like them for two hours and then it's goodbye. What's wrong with you? You look like you have... - You can't talk about attachment! - Ah, we're still on this! - Yes, we are! - Yes, Cassandre! Oh, my God! I don't understand. What is the definition of attachment? It's the moment when you're entitled to make mistakes, come back, and argue. - If you meet someone for two hours... - Yeah! I'm entitled to it all! We don't even know who we are! Melissa? Melissa, do you have a cigarette? I only have rolled cigarettes. - We only smoke rolled cigarettes here! - Do you guys have a cigarette? - Vincent? Vincent? - Does anyone have a cigarette? Don't you have a real cigarette? An industrial one? I'll roll one up for you. Are you OK, sir? Would you like some change? Sir! He's scared of you! Would you like some change, sir? - You are very scary. - You're very scary! - We saw a shadow! - Don't stand in the dark! - You said Alessandro and now it's Aless. - But you... No, it's OK, it's OK! - Do you like him? - Yeah. Do you like him too? - I do! - Well that's that. He'll take us back. Slow down! What the hell! She puked all over the seat! Give me her bag! Damn it, Melissa! You piss me off! Every weekend it's the same damn thing! Here's her bag! You fucking asshole! Shut the fuck up! Are you okay? Is this for trash? - That's for trash. - Hold on. You can throw that away... 2010. That's disgusting stuff! They were at your grandmother's and we've been carrying them for years. - It was fashionable back then! - But why? - It was for decoration. - Are we throwing it away? - No, I've always had it. - You use it if you don't want to be seen when you go next door. That... that's not possible... Another box of 2004 documents. 2004 is to be thrown out. We don't need anything before 2010. We have to keep these for ten years. - Why? - It's the law. - We can throw that out too. It's 2002. - OK, wow... Hold on. I'll take it out later. We're almost done. - Account 2016, so it's thrown out. - No, we're keeping it. Just kidding! OK, you're listening. We forgot that! What do we do with this? We'll put them in the cellar... The basement. Don't you want to throw them out? No. We'll put them in the basement. - Hey. - How are you? Yes... - Isn't Dad with you? - No, he's eating with his lawyer. What for? For yet another appeal. It will never fucking end! Is there anything new? Well... no. He's apparently still at it. I don't get why he does this. Three appeals didn't work. His lawyer doesn't charge him anymore. He invites him to the restaurant! Why doesn't he get a second appraisal? Because she was the one speeding, even if it wasn't much. So... The speed limit is fifty and she was doing fifty-seven. What were you thinking? That she was doing between seventy to eighty. Even though Wing is a low cost company, it... I've always encouraged my team to... to offer the best services to all our clients, even the ones they don't know yet. You should know we're a very exclusive private jet company, we don't really say "clients". We actually call them "guests" not passengers. How would you define yourself, Cassandre? I will define myself as an enthusiastic person, really positive, who love adventures, travels and meeting new people. So, what's your relationship status? Do you have a new boyfriend or do you have any kids? Oh, no, I'm completely single. I mean, I'm not attached to anything or anyone, I have no ties. I mean, for example, if you want me to travel tomorrow to Tokyo or to fly to Japan, I can do it in the minute, so... As you say, flexibility and availability are definitely the command, in our world "no" does not exist. Flexibility is definitely the main quality that we look forward to be part of our company. For example, let's say you're in Kinshasa and your guest wants sushi, for the next flight in two hours. What do you do? I will call all the hotels, the luxury palace, to see if there is any chefs, Japanese chefs, of course, or... any sushi in the menu, and in the worst case I will... cook it myself. Next. How do you handle a guest making an inappropriate proposal? When this situation came I always try to delay to avoid the situation but not directly saying no. So I try to avoid physical contact with him, or I pretend to be cold for the day, for example, or I will make a little joke and say, "Watch, we're flying over the Alps right now." Great. So we're looking for personality. Elegance is also very important to us. So, what do you do to stay in good shape? I practice fitness to keep my shape, and also it helps me to really release the pressure. Great. Can I ask you to stand up and walk a little, please? Of course. Okay, turn around. Okay, thank you very much, you can come back, thank you. So, your hair, is that your natural colour? Yes. But I can be blond if it's better for the guests. Okay. So, Cassandre, the recommendation of Dounia was definitely accurate, I think your profile is a great match for what we're looking for, so could you be in Dubai on March 4 to meet Sylvia, our crew member supervisor, and Natasha, our training manager? I will have to make some plans but I... I will be here, yeah, I will come. Is it the same area all the way through or is it... - Is it wider here? - Yes, it's wider here. We're thinking of placing the kitchen here... What's very fashionable at the moment are island kitchens... It's very welcoming, for drinks and doing homework with the children... a play area there and the more parental area here... - I'll let you look around? - Okay. Can I have a sip of your beer? Who bought that gnome? You know who. I forgot. Your mother liked tall men but she also liked garden gnomes. She was full of contradictions. Before you, was she with someone tall or short? Before me, she wasn't with anyone. That's what you think! She had no one before you? I didn't say she didn't have anyone. I said she wasn't with anyone. But do you really know? - That she wasn't with anyone? - Yeah. Getting the light on used to be my favourite game. Sure, cheerleaders... Papa Beaver. Tell us a story, Papa Beaver. No, really, don't you know? No. When I appeared... she was very young and so was I, and... we met over there. - Not far from here. - How did you pick her up? - Tell us all the details. - No... - Please! - No, that's our story. But it's ours too! What did you tell her? And how? To know the whole story, I think it's... I think she was hitting on me but she always said the opposite. But I think she was pushing it a bit. Did she dance well? She danced very well. I liked that best, among other things. - Can you imitate her? - And she was always... No, I couldn't do that! So, how did you dance? Back in those days, it was minimal. Did you ask her to dance? We weren't at the ball, you know! There were rock stages and concerts. We weren't inviting each other. We weren't at the ball. When was the first kiss? The first time we kissed? Well, it was after a concert and we were pretty drunk... and... I think it helped me overcome my shyness and not to overthink it. She seemed to agree. The proof is that you arrived not long after. So there was something. For once I figured it out. - Were you there for both births? - Of course. The first one was "whoa." - Why? - Because it was... I was very young and so was she. We didn't know and then suddenly it was real. You were very small... like a real, small animal. Thirty centimetres long... I can't remember... I remember the weight but not the size. It was 3.5 kg. I don't know the size. I can't remember. But then it was real, and we looked at each other like, "That's it!" - What do you mean? - That you were there. We switched to something else. Then everything went very quickly... Everything changed. Your delivery too, it was... for other reasons, it was very strong. Your mother had a problem at the last moment and you couldn't come out. The epidural wasn't working. So they decided to open... to do a caesarean... And so... I had to take you and have skin contact, you know? When the baby arrives, they put it on the mother's breast... to warm the baby up... but as she had a caesarean I took you on me to warm you up, to calm you down, to comfort you, and you were a little animal looking for the breast. Sorry, I didn't have any. It's a reflex the baby has when it comes out it's a survival thing. It climbs up to reach the breast. A little animal. So... When reported, the vehicle was found embedded on the pile of rocks in the roundabout. The vehicle is on its side at a 45 degree angle, approximately 7.5 metres from the road. The driver, Mrs Sabine Wassels, 53 years old, is deceased. I'm sorry. We can take a little break if you want. I'm obliged to read it. It's the law in fact. I have no choice. - It's not pleasant for me either. - Let's go on. The front end, passenger compartment and the engine crashed into the rocks in the landscaping. The left fender was crushed, part of the vehicle was on fire, and the right rear tyre was burst. A large amount of rubber residue was found on the road surface at an angle of approximately 125 degrees, suggesting that the vehicle had veered violently onto the far-right lane. When reported, the roundabout was partially covered with gravel. This may be due to a construction site on the road leading to Floreffe. Yet, we cannot certify that this was the direct cause of the tyre blow-out that caused the vehicle to deviate from its course. After that, there are still two or three Volkswagen and then it's Peugeots, because those are all Fiats. But it's not possible... Here it is. This is the document for the court to say that the vehicle was not present. So the assessment could not take place. This will be the other copy for me... Forward... How long will it take for the court to process a... to set a new date for a new expert opinion? Well... If there's no vehicle, I won't be able to carry out the assessment. - Well, that's... - Not you, but... I don't know... that there is a new file and a new assessment? Then we'll have to close the case and slowly move on to compensation... especially if there is no more vehicle. I don't even know how to drink that. I forgot. - What is it, a shot? - No. Not everything is a shot, Cassandre. It smells like solvent. I'm sure when you drink shots, you get a little tear. Isn't that true? You have the little... I'm drinking it for you, Dad. You've got fags? - Do you want a fag? - Yes. - A fag. - I haven't got one on me. - Do you have any? - For you? Well, what? In my bag in the hall. You shouldn't blame yourself. - Not even a little? - No. I was angry with you when you left and didn't warn us in advance. Actually, I didn't know what to say. I didn't know if I was going to come home or not. I didn't know what to say. I'm sorry. Keep moving, please, everyone keep moving. Keep moving, please, everyone keep moving. Show will start in two minutes, keep moving.
