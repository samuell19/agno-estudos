That is your problem right there. Baby, there's not a woman on this planet that I have to chase after. But I want you. Alright now marriage is nice for some people. Look I just hate imprisoning myself to political correctness you know. But that's why I love what we have. I mean I can tell you how I really feel. And how do you really feel? No filter? I'm a big girl. Ok, big girl. Oh thank god not in the literal sense. Oh my god don't be an A hole. Look I just think that you allow your girl LaTonja to get inside your head. I mean she manipulates your mind baby, and that's dangerous to give a person that must power over you. Oh my god, shut up. Just please shut up. The only reason why your saying that is because she don't fall for your BS. You know what you really have no idea how to just dim the lights, and flick off the camera and stop acting do?

Oh It's called mind manipulations baby. I swear man that woman is a She lucky I'm a christian. Ha, christian my ass. The only reason why you go to church is to trick those good people out of there support. Only when you have a movie to promote. I'm currently on the christian alumni association ok. No seriously, Sister Alina. You need to stop allowing your so called manager/friend to play on your insecurities. I am not insecure. Don't you even say that to me again. Don't you try to flip this around on me and call me insecure. I have forgiven you twice. So I don't even know how we're having this conversation. Baby I love you.

Honey you need to light a fire up under his behind. I'm telling you Alina, women they don't respect and honor men that they have to take care of. That's true. Ok you can't be letting this brotha lay up in your house and you taken care of him, and you feeding him and you clothing him. That's like taking care of your son. Yea Ok and then eventually he's gonna wanna have sex. And not paying no bills, that's gone piss you off. And let me ask you a question. How do you know that he didn't have his boys rob you just to try to look like superman? You know what, I considered that. I actually thought about that.

I can't front. I lost everything and I just couldn't face her, so I left. You're wack for that. I am, but being homeless had showed me who I am. I may not have the money that I once had but I'm a better person. Do you still love her? Yes, I do. Is there anything that you want to tell me? I promised myself that I wasn't gonna be naive. That I was gonna judge peoples character before I just let them in my life. I need a new pair of running shoes and the pipe in the bathroom needs to be fixed. It's a lot of stuff that needs to be repaired around here. You need to find yourself. Goodnight. You like that? Uh uh. Why? Oh boy. I don't I... And this one on my gosh it gives me so much life.

Girly Are you mad because I had to put you on time out for a few weeks so you could check yourself. You really like the sound of your own voice. You need to check yourself. You know I thought that you would have given me a call by now. But I underestimated you. So you know even a brotha like me has to get on his knees and plea every now and then. I'm not asking you to get on your knees. So please don't. What are you sure? Yea. Because you know I'd do it. You know how humble I am. What, what do you really want Reg? Why are you here? Look baby, I know that you have a kind heart, and that's what attracts me to you. But you can't bring homeless people into your home. I mean that's just not safe. You know. Why is he even there? Because it's my house and I can do what I want. But Lina he's a grown ass man. He's not a boy or a pet? He has to make his way like all of us. Stop it. Alina I'm just tryna look out for you. Really? Yes The another night you said you didn't want to marry me is the night he came out of no where and saved my life. OK good. Now it's time for him to pull out his cap and beat it. Baby you've paid him back. What more does he want from you? Look, I can't have a homeless man squating with the love that I love and wanna marry. Didn't you feed the homeless before? Yeah but that was to promote my Christmas movie. Alina I want you to be my wife. I want you to be my wife. Will you marry me? I don't have time for your games. No I'm serious baby. No games. What about you being young, rich and gifted? I am young, alright I'm rich, I'm gifted. I'm fine too, but baby those things don't complete me ok. You do. Listen the last few weeks that we haven't talked has really given me some time to think about us. I love you Alina Young. Your arrogance is so unattractive. Baby you confused. It's confidence. Look just keep the ring on your finger and think about it. Please? Will you make a conscience effort to change? Of course. Give me some time to think about it. Alright. I'm serious I'm serious. I will think about it. And how is she? I always liked Sabrina Yeah she was pretty cool. Yea it was just crazy seeing her man. What the hell is going on? Marv, oh my god. Oh nah they just came... Get out of my house. Get out of my house. I didn't know you'd be trippin you know. What the hell is wrong with you? I'm Sorry Why you just gone invite people in my house? Ok I'm sorry. What made you think this was ok? Now you seeming a little prejudice toward homeless people now and I don't like that. You sound like you're being stupid on purpose, and I don't like that. This is not about people being homeless. It's about respect, you don't do this to somebody you say you care about. I'm sorry, ok. For the life of me I don't get it. I don't understand you being uncaring and unappreciative. Go check the pipes in your room. Go check everything that's been broken in here. What are you talking about? I invited them over to fix your house. I mean I didn't think that you would mind. They helped you fix the stuff around here? That's what I been tryna tell you, yeah. Oh I'm sorry. Oh no, no, no no, no, no I am sorry. Oh my god I feel so bad right now. It's ok. Oh my god. A did you go shopping today? What do you mean? You got a new ring on your ring finger. Reggie asked me to marry him. I told him I'd think about it. You'd think about it? You love this dude? You love ol girl? At least I don't fake front and pretend. It is what it is with me. It's not about no Sabrina, I already told you that I love her. Yeah I remember that. Oh are you jealous? Not even in your most wildest dreams. Me and Reggie been together along time, and it has not been the easiest journey but it is what it is. That's BS, that's what that is. That's a lot of BS. You said something about being caring and concerned is why you ended up homeless. What did you mean? Can you explain that to me? Six months before the housing market crashed, I find out of some illegal practices that were going on at my firm. David, Jesus and I we paid the consequences for being the whistle blower. We lost everything. Now I sit on a park bench, and I watch people that are, they just blind, to the sacrifices that me and my friends have made. Sometime man I wish that like, that I'd gone along with those robberies. Cause all those people now their rich. Look at me. I'm over here getting hand outs, from my friend. You know what I think?

Marriage is a life long commitment. You're not ready to make that journey with me? Well Marv said I should... Don't mention his name to me anymore. I heard you taking financial advice from this loser. Did William tell you that advice willed me back some handsome profits? Seems like both of y'all are intimidated by him. No one intimidates me. Especially some bum. If I wanna know about collecting garbage or how comfortable a park bench is, he's the man. Were you really fixing your mouth to tell me that he's advising you on our marriage? Do you really trust this dude? Yea, it's hard to talk to you about anything, gosh. I really don't have time for all this Alina. I been displaying a lot of patience because I know you like to take on these little pet projects. But my patience is wearing thin. He has to go. I have a few meetings to go to. When I get back I'll have an answer for you. And when we first started dating, you were amazing. Of course you weren't as famous as you are now. I don't know who this person is. You use to be humble. That's the guy I feel in love with. I'll have an answer for you when I get back. What's up Hey man. We finally meet. Infamous Marvelous. I see you got on one of my shirts. Hey listen I usually don't shake hands with the homeless but for you I'll make an exception then. Ok, whatever screw you. So listen, Alina man, she didn't want to be here for this. She just didn't have the heart to do it so she asked me. I'll tell you you had a real good thing going here, really good. But how long did you really expect to leach off of Alina, huh? Oh yeah she asked me to pack your bags too. And make sure that you're out of here by the time that she gets back. I think I'll let her tell me herself bro. Nah, it's good. I'm here, I'm back. So get your stuff and get the hell out. I will knock you out. Testy are we. Oh my gosh. Listen I'm not a fighter. I be the first to admit that. But I know you are.

It's ugly. There all ugly. Ok Alina we have gone through 100 photos and you don't let any of the dresses. Come on. Ok, alright, alright, alright, I got a story to tell you and it's a true story, I promise to God. You ready for it. Uh huh. Ok so there was this guy right. He was the real playboy type right. Filthy rich, you know the playboys are rich right. Women galore, he had a big ol mansion a private plane. All this stuff going on right. He could get whatever woman he wanted. But there was this one woman he could not have because she refuse to be with him, because she wanted to wait and have sex when she got married. Wow - Yes isn't that crazy - That's crazy. True story. Wow This was like in the 50's or 60's right, so she didn't know he was married, because we didn't have all the Facebook - No relationship status - And all the Twitter And all the social networking, you know Knowing what's going on in relationships right. Right So she didn't know he had wife and he had a bunch of women. But she didn't care, she went met a man that was willing to wait got engaged, got married. This fool had the nerve to get all pissed off. Hired some guys, tossed acid in her eyes. What? Yeah, because he felt like, if I can't have you nobody else could. He gets convicted goes to jail. Her husband divorces her. Whoa. And are you ready for the twist of the story. This is crazy. Ok When he gets out of jail, he reconnects with the woman and they end up getting married and living happily ever after. No way - True story - Na uh. That is not a true story. But you know what the moral of the story is. Is that the universe has this way right of pulling people back together in ways that we don't even understand. It's been two months since I saw Marv. Listen I'm sure he's ok. And plus we ain't seen him out beggin. That's true. So I guess the universe is putting money in his pocket. I think all the time. What did he do with the money he stole? I don't know. That situation is a little sticky to me. You know. I tell you. My intuition is popping off the charts. It makes no sense. It makes no sense. I really don't think he did it. But you think William would concoct something that evil. Yes I do, with the help of Reggie, absolutely. Can I tell you, and I just gotta be honest? I don't think you should marry Reggie. I have a migraine. Aww baby you do. Come here and give me a hug. Alright listen we don't have to look at any more wedding books Ugly dresses. No we're done. But listen there is one thing I do want to say. This movie that Reggie is currently filming right now is one of those kind of movies that's really good for him. If he's engaged or married you know. His PR would be off the chain. And sometimes those PR firms they will do whatever they need to do to try to make their clients pop. I'm not saying he's tryna marry you because of that. But I just want you to keep that in mind ok. Alright honey listen, keep you heart open keep your eyes open and just trust your spirit. Ok You hear me? Um huh. I love you. I love you. God's got you. Come here. You're strong, you're mighty Even if the odds are against you, you will survive. You're strong, you're mighty Even if the odds are against you, you will survive. You're strong, you're mighty Even if the odds are against you, you will survive. Hi You look great I'm trying You look like your doing more that trying. I got a job at Johnson Realty. David and Jesus got hired too. Just taking baby steps. Baby steps? I knew you could do it. I fired William. So I may be calling you up soon. Oh you wanna invest your money with somebody you trust. I don't think I'm the man for that job. You still getting married to Reggie? Tomorrow Congratulations Are you happy? Just for the record, I didn't steal that money. Do you come here a lot? I do.
