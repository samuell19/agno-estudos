You gotta meet me at spit fork right now. I'm so happy, I could just kiss you! Now that's just wrong. Why? Because you're my sister. Oops, keep forgettin'. Yeah, just get on with it. Meet me up there. (thrilling music) I'm so excited! (thrilling music) (Bigfoot grunting) (both shouting) I thought you were Bigfoot! Quit you're talking, he's right over there. Where? Shh. Go, go, go. Get going. (thrilling music) [Rusty] He's not here! [Wally] What do you mean he's not there? [Rusty] He got away. Oh, no, he got away. Well, you know what?

Hey Penny, it's Dr. Dawn. - Hi, Dr. Dawn. - How are you? I'm doing great, how are you? Listen, there's been a bunch of Bigfoot sightings in the area. I'm so excited. And I really think that he's close this time. So I've been talking to some of the girls from the team, and I thought what we'd do is we'd get together again. I really think this time we might find him. Oh my God, I just had the craziest dream. I dreamt Bigfoot was stalking me, and there he was. That's kind of an omen. I think it is. So the girls are all getting ready to come tomorrow morning. I've also got an ad on Craigslist for a new girl. So we'll meet here tomorrow, nine o'clock? Okay, that's perfect. See you then. Bye. Pull! (rifle cocks) (rifle blasts) Pull! (rifle cocks) (rifle blasts) Pull! (rifle cocks) (rifle blasts) Pull! (rifle cocks) (rifle blasts) Pull! (rifle cocks) (rifle blasts) Pull!

What are you doing here? Just though I'd check on my sis. Yeah, well, I'm doing just fine. You can go now. Mm, yeah, you seem real fine. God, you're still so angry. I mean, Jess, it's been five years. When are you gonna let this go? When are you gonna give a shit that our father's dead? You don't think that this kills me every single day, huh? It was a horrible accident. He was in the wrong place at the wrong time. It was about a bunch of greedy hunters out for Bigfoot. And again, he got away. And our father lost his life because of it. And it's gonna happen to somebody else unless this damn beast is caught. (gentle music) All right, why don't you get him? What? Come on, Jess. You're the best shot in this neck of the woods. If anyone could hunt him down, it's you. Do it. Do it for dad. - I love you, Billy. - Love you too, kiddo. Now, gear up and go get him.

She answered the add in Craigslist, and I thought she was perfect. So Daisy's not done this before, so we're gonna teach her. This is my first time, first time. And then, Tilly, you're gonna be showing her how to do the sword and the toys. Yes, I am. - Yeah. - Oh. Yeah. And Penny, you're gonna be showing her how we use our sensuality to... - To be sexy. Oh, I heard he likes booties. And I heard Bigfoot likes big titties. (Dawn laughs) Right? (jugs of water sloshing) So we're gonna seduce him out, but this time we're gonna find him. And I even heard that they've had these wolf calls, like woo, hoo, hoo! You know, the Bigfoot making noises. But like is the local news gonna be here? Is like CNN? Oh, when we get selfies with Bigfoot, and then when we actually interview him, oh, we're gonna have so much press. But like how long do you think it's gonna be before we get famous? Oh, right away. - Yeah, it's instant. - Right away. Then I'm in, I'm in, I'm in. So do you guys have outfits for the hunt? I do, I do, I do. Yeah, sexy stuff? Okay, let's change. - Let's do it. - Okay. - Let's go. (upbeat country music) Hi, my name is Penny Blossom, and I'm an internet influencer. I have a lot of people following me, and I have sponsors that pay me money because they like me. They think I'm cute. But the main reason is I get visited from celebrities that have passed away and they come and see me because they tell me I'm special. Hi, I'm Dr. Dawn. This is gonna be my third expedition to find Bigfoot. And this time we're gonna find him. I'm so excited. I've actually been an enthusiastic about Bigfoot since I was a little girl in England, and I was part of the Girl Guides. Girl Scouts over here, but that, you know, we're more hardcore in England. I'm Daisy May. I'm a stripper by trade, but I'm trying to make a career change and become a successful famous person. So what happened was I'm at my strip club, and I'm talking to one of my regulars. And his friend comes in and says, "Guess what, Charlie?" That's my regular. "There is a Bigfoot out in the woods on the loose." My name is Tilly Takahashi. I'm half-German and half-Japanese. My mother was German, and she named me Tilly because I have bravery and strength. And my father gave me his sword on his deathbed. So I travel with it wherever I go. Even in the forest, even when I'm on the bathroom. You know why? Because Bigfoot can sneak up on you in the forest. Even when you're popping a squat! Ahoy maties, I'm Jesse James from Bigfoot or Bust. And I have a plan to come back and prove to everyone that Bigfoot exists and bring him back alive. But in my care. I have a way of taming beasts. Hi, I'm Rusty Ready. I'm Wally's sister. Well, I used to think we were cousins, but I found out he's my brother, which is so strange because also there's a rumor in our family that we're related to Bigfoot. And it's been my dream since I was a little, little, little, little, little girl to capture Bigfoot, and I'm gon do it. If I have to entice him any way I can. (giggles) Hi, I'm Wally, and I am a lean, mean killing machine. Lean? I even got firepower because the number one thing that's on my plate right now is Bigfoot. He's mine. I'm gonna get very large amounts of money for that thing. Big smelly turd. By the way, these are my horses. (sheep bleating) This is my farm. You go on my website anytime you want because I can teach you how to ride one of them horses. (upbeat country music) Okay, ladies, are we locked and loaded and ready to go? Yes, we are. I got my crossbow. Ready to shoot. - Woo! - My darts. Now, Daisy, I have an instrument here. - Okay. - I'm gonna give you this. This is a tranquilizer gun, right? Just 'cause it's your first time and everything. What does it do? If he gets close, you're gonna, you're gonna shoot him with it. Okay, okay, where? In the butt, right, in the butt? - I say in the butt. - In the butt, in the butt? Oh no, no. We need to shoot him in the balls. - In the balls? - Ooh, nasty! I mean, if he's not cooperating. - Like that! - Yeah, exactly. And so you know the one action where you. - Okay. - Yeah, there you go. There you go. - Like that! - Right. - And then that. And also Penny will cover you. Hopefully you won't shoot one of us, but if you do. I have Narcan in my backpack. Oh, well that would help. Okay, but if I shoot him in the balls, how are we gonna do a good interview? I thought you said there's gonna be like news crews from all over the world. We'll do the selfies first, and if he's not cooperating, then you shoot him in the balls. - I don't think this... - We'll tell you. We'll tell you when to do it, yeah. Right, are we ready? - Yeah. - Are we ready to go? - Yes. - Yeah, let's do it ladies! Let's go!

Billy, you're not gonna believe what just happened. I'm driving my Jeep, and Bigfoot just ran across the road right in front of my Jeep. Did you shoot him? I got out, I ran with my gun, but I couldn't catch him. But can you believe that? All right, look, be careful, regroup and take care of business. I'll get him, don't you worry. All right, keep you posted, bye. (electricity whirring) Is everyone all right? - Yes. - Yes. Okay, good. What year is it? 2022. Well, at least it's not 2020. (audience laugh track) Where is Bigfoot? We're gonna find out. (energy whirring) I see him. Let's go that way. - Yep. - Yeah. Let's go. Where'd you last see Bigfoot? Well, last time he got really close, but we were watching for the droppings. We were looking on the ground to see if we could see any, any... You mean the poop? Wait, wait, hold it, hold it, guys. This thing is so heavy. I just don't know what to do, I can't carry it anymore. Yeah, me too, this is really heavy. Okay, come on, girls. Use your brain, put it in your backpack. (suspenseful music) Hey there, sweetheart. First I got your daddy, and now I got his kin. (dramatic music) (Rusty grunts) (body thuds) (women gasp) Adios, doll. (laughs) (Rusty laughs maniacally) (suspenseful music) (Bigfoot grunting) (suspenseful music) Oh my God, did you bitches just hear that? That's Bigfoot, it's gotta be Bigfoot! That has to be something, that was really big. Yes, let's get him! - Come on, girls, let's go! - Let's do this. Oh my God, are you sure? Okay, I guess I really wanna get famous. What is that? (women chattering) Someone's hurt! Oh! Oh! Oh my God, you guys. Is she dead? Is she dead? Dr. Dawn, you're a doctor. Is she dead? - It's Jesse. Well, no, no, wait, wait, wait. You're a doctor, you can help her. You're a doctor? She's a doctor. - Are you okay? Yeah, she is a doctor. Well, I'm not that kind of a doctor. Oh! She's alive. She's alive. - What, are you okay? Are you okay? - Oh my God. - You've broken something? - You okay? You need help. - No, no, I'm good. I'm good. You guys, she's alive. Jesse, what are you doing here? Holy cow. Some freaking, whatever the hell that was. Bigfoot! Are you guys looking for Bigfoot too? - Yes. - Yeah. - Oh my God. - Are you looking for Bigfoot? Yes. Yes. - Did you find him? He snuck up on me. Bigfoot threw you off the bridge? - Was he stinky? - I think so. Oh my God, you're so lucky to be alive. I know. - I know. - You were so close. Did you feel him, did you smell him? I, I, I could... I could sense that he was there or something was there. And then I just saw his. I'm amazed, there's not even any blood. Here, help her up, help her up. - We were right, okay. - Can you stand up? Oh, I'm fine. I'm good, I'm good. - You wanna join us? I mean, really? - Yeah, that'd be great. - Yeah. [Jesse] I think that would be fricking awesome. - Woo! - Yay, honey! There's not a scratch on you. All right, guys. - Let's go. - Come on, yeah. - This a-way. - Okay. And stay clear of that bridge, for the love of God. There's not a scratch on you, bitch. And you still look good. (letters whooshing) He's gotta be out there somewhere. You know, I think it's time for Bigfoot calling. Yeah, Tarzan style. Oh. (women yelling) Is it working? (women yelling) Bigfoot! Let's try Jane style. What's Jane style? Like. (high-pitched yelling) Oh. (high-pitched yelling) Like a girlie one. (high-pitched yelling) Is he coming? No. Let's try ape style, like. (Dawn grunting) - Oh, okay. (women grunting) [Dawn] Yeah, put with it. (women grunting) Like put it in. (women grunting) Maybe we need to try something else. Try this one. (high-pitched screeching) Okay. (loud screeching) No, no, you need to be louder than that, Penny. Like this. (high-pitched screeching) Okay, let me try. (loud screeching) [Dawn] No, no, like this one. (high-pitched screeching) Okay. (low buzzing) (suspenseful, melodramatic music) Okay, that has gotta do it. That has to do it. Do you see him yet? No. (quirky whooshing) We need some like real sound system. Yeah, maybe we can try and find a real sound system, and that would work. - Yeah. I bet that would work. There's gotta be one round here somewhere. Yeah. Do you think he's close? I think I smell him. Yeah. We are real close, I smell him too. All right, team. We need to remember why we are here. But why are we here? Yeah, why are we here? (audience laugh track) To get Bigfoot's droppings. You mean we're here looking for shit? Yeah. No, I mean, for medicinal purposes, we need his droppings. Team. In 2050, Bigfoot droppings are worth trillions and trillions. - Wow. All we need is just two or three of those big babies, and we'll be trillionaires. (women squeal) That is great, oh my God! Get it together, let's go. Droppings, shit. This is gonna be the third time that I've done this. The call me Dr. Dawn because I'm a doctor. I have a PhD from Oxford in chemical engineering. Actually it was a little, little college down the road from the regular Oxford. And it's actually in paranormal science. But you know, I don't tell the girls that. I'm a little on the edge, and I'm not sure that, you know, they all really appreciate that. I had an Elvis sighting, and he asked me if he can help me. And I go, "Yeah, sure. "But you're not really Elvis, are you?" He goes, "No, I'm Elvis. "No one can see me, but you because you're special. "And I'm making an appearance." I said, "Can I get a selfie?" So I took a selfie, and I turned around to finish putting the gas on, he just disappeared into thin air. And this particular Bigfoot is really attracted to white girls with big booties. Like mine. You might wonder why I joined this expedition. Well, I felt like the girls could use my help because I have sword skills! I think I'm very strong. And I don't think Bigfoot is gonna stand a chance against me, even though I'm much smaller than him. It doesn't matter, I've got brains too. And he's just a big oaf. What is he doing wandering around the forest all the time? Wait, wait, whoa, whoa, whoa. Look, look, look. [Tilly] Is that an animal? It's a clue, it looks... - Oh my God. - Oh no, it looks like. - It stinks. - What is that stench? Ew! Ew, ew, ew. - It smells. Ew, ew, ew. - Does it smell like him? - What is it? - Oh. - I don't wanna smell it. I can smell it from here, don't get closer, no! You can see the skin underneath if you look. Oh no, it's fresh. It came from his butt? Well, this looks like where the legs would be. - Maybe he's hurt. - Yeah, maybe he's hurt. Maybe somebody cut him. Well, he hurt me, good for him. So wait a second. Does this mean we're one more step closer to finding Bigfoot? So we're one step closer to getting famous? No, I think what happened was he... Oh my God, I'm so excited. He's gotta be close. - Okay, let's go find him. - Yeah. - Okay, find him. - This is my moment. I'm getting famous. I'm brave. Here we go! Oh my God. (thrilling music) Oh my God. Guys, unless that's a mirage, that is a trampoline! - A what? - Trampoline. - Are you sure? - I'm positive. - Just like that? - Let's go check it out! (women cheering) Let's go jump on it! (women cheering) Trampoline! - God, freaking awesome. Oh my God, I love trampolines. (women cheering) Oh, I am so excited! I love trampolines. - Who's gonna go first? Me, me, me, me, me, me, me, I'm always last. I'm going first. No, I'm always fucking last. I'm going first, bitches, I go first. Wait. Did you know there's actually scientific evidence that squeaky springs are gonna excite Bigfoot? - Really? - Wow. So if we jump really high, we could get him all excited, and he could come down to us. I'm really good at making beds squeak. So let me see what I can do. - Okay. - Whoa, whoa, whoa. Just, just, guys, be careful though, because you know, if he does appear, you got, you got, you know. - Are we ready? - We're ready.

Well, that's not another that that's where blood is collected under the skin where the injury was. Are you feeling dizzy? Yeah, a little, yeah. Yeah, I'm a little concerned you've got a concussion. Just don't go to sleep. Don't take a nap for at least six hours. Why is that? Because you might not wake up. (melodramatic music) (Bigfoot roaring) Did you hear that? What? Nothing.

We were here first, we're hunting Bigfoot. We're the ones that are gonna hunt Bigfoot because we need his crap. Oh no, you're not. Yeah, and it's worth trillions. You're telling me that you are collecting his poop? We're getting his poop. Bigfoot is passing gold bars? Practically, and we're gonna be rich! - Yes! - That's right. I'm a scientist, this is fascinating. What are you gonna do with it? Doesn't matter what you think because we have the big guns. Oh yeah, well look at these guns. (balloons bouncing loudly) She's got pretty big guns. - Wow. - Yeah. Those are... (audience laugh track) Big guns. Well, what about yours? - We got big guns too. - Mm-hmm. (audience laugh track) So you are out. You're not gonna hurt him with those guns, are you? No, we're just gonna scare the poop out of him. (woman laughs) What do you do in the future? What is this poop gonna be for? (woman laughs) I need to know about this, I need to know about everything. All right, enough of this. Well, tell me about the future. What is it about?

I don't know, Jesse's gone. - What happened? - I don't know. I mean, I look around and she's just not there anymore. Don't know where she went. Oh my God. Did Bigfoot come back for her? - He came back for her! - Oh my God. I think so, I don't know. I don't know anything! - Where did it happen? - You didn't see anything? Look, we've got two hours of daylight left. We gotta find her. We gotta hurry, come on. Oh my God. So are we still gonna be famous even if we don't find the bitch?

I'm so worried about Jesse. Yeah, we looked all day long. If we didn't find her, I mean, there's not much chance. No, don't think that way. She's probably dead. No, she made it once. Wait, wait, what if they found her and she's on the news? What if it's on the news? Bitch, we can't watch no news. There's no power. We're lucky to have these itty bitty flashlights. I don't wanna give up. So what if she's out there dead and bloody. Shouldn't we call Dateline? - No! - No, we can't tell Dateline. Like, they'd be interested. This would be a scoop. You would never be famous. Dateline isn't gonna make me famous? No, we're gonna get in big trouble. You can't call the TV. They're gonna send a crew out. They're gonna find her. And you'll never get to be famous 'cause we didn't find her! (dramatic music) (hand banging) (women screaming) What was that? Jesse! [Daisy] Jesse! Oh my God. She's alive. What happened? Oh my God, when I left you, I went down the hill. We were so worried. I was walking around for a bit, and I like saw Bigfoot in the distance. Again? Just all of a sudden it made a beeline for me. And I was like kinda behind rocks. And he started chasing me. And then he came close to me, and he was trying to pull my bra off. Oh my God. (women chattering) (women screaming) Wait, that's nothing. He actually physically... (women screaming) Tried to take my bra off. He's a pervert, first and foremost. Just saying. Guys, listen, he's not just after me. He's about a block away. (women screaming) He's on my tail. He's coming, he's coming to the house? Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. Aren't we trying to find this mother fucker? Okay, but you can't fight him off with flashlights. You guys need to be armed. (women chattering excitedly) Oh my God, weapons, weapons, weapons! Go get 'em. - Let's get the weapons. - Let's get the weapons. [Penny] Weapons! Do y'all see anything? - Nope. - No. Wait a second, where's Jesse? Did we lose her again? Do you think Bigfoot got her? Nah, she's just in the room changing. It's been a stressful day. What do we do? We need to change up the mood. You know the best way to de-stress? Put on some good tunes and shake some ass. Yeah, let's do it. Yeah! - Lets do it!

Jesse, Tilly, while we're young! She's gone! Jesse's disappeared again. What do you mean? I looked for her everywhere. In the bathrooms, the bedrooms, the garage, poof! - What? - Yeah. (finger rattling) Something stinks in Denmark. And I'll tell you why. Do you guys remember yesterday she "supposedly" fell off a bridge onto a big rock? Bitch didn't have a scratch on her. And then she showed up at the house last night, face on point. That was weird. Hair did. What are you saying? Are you saying that... That she made this up? That Bigfoot really didn't attack her? Yeah, I mean, you know what, with all that fur, that's probably the fur that we found. She went back and got it when she disappeared. And that thing about the bra strap. I mean, that was weird. I didn't believe that. - She's crazy. And last night she said the fool was like a block away and coming right for us. Dude never showed up. And we were dancing all sexy and everything. I mean, if he was out there, he would've for sure come and got us. Let's go look for him, her and Bigfoot. Yeah, let's track 'em both. Can we call Dateline? So I have been practicing at home, which my boyfriend, Roger, didn't really like it 'cause I was doing that... (hissing like a cat) You know, getting my Cat girl on. And doing my paw licking stuff. (Dawn moaning) And people think I'm hallucinating, but I know it was the real Elvis 'cause he told me and he assured me. So I said, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding. I've been trying to get out of the stripping business for a minute now, trying to find a new career. And I really wanna get famous. I don't do dog stuff 'cause I'm a cat, right? So we're all gonna be getting our spirit guide animal, getting the animalistic thing. And that's really gonna bring out the feminine pheromones in all of us, but our animalistic kind. My sponsorship has been going down a little. So what I did... I decided to get into the... Was I said, I'm gonna go find Bigfoot. Looking for Bigfoot business. I'm gonna get a selfie with Bigfoot. So I'm very excited. You know, we got a bunch of girls here. We're all gonna be getting our furry on. And hopefully there is a Bigfoot out there somewhere, and if there is... And we're gonna find him, and we're gonna get him. We're gonna empower him with our femininity. I'm gonna find him. We're gonna interact with him. We're gonna find out about his thoughts and his feelings and his inner self, and why he's been hiding out all these years. I would bet on me. If you're a betting person, Vegas odds have it, that we're 50 to one, whatever that means. I'm not a betting person. So I met some other girls along the way, and they are out to do the same thing. Five girls together? Now come on guys, you can't beat that. We're gonna get him.

(beam whirring) (tires rumbling) Bubba, you are getting rid of that ugly TV if it is the last thing you do. I don't care if it's got a built in VHS. It's battery operated!

Oh, pfft, I take care of your ass. Here, it's $2, take it. What I owe you, 10 more? Now, Bubba, you cannot get caught stealing again, all right? You're not gonna be able to go to college because you're gonna go to the pokey! You remember that time that you got caught flashing those nuns in public? (both laughing) Yeah. Well, you stole those prescription drugs from that store after hours? Oh my God. Yeah, I remember that. Bubba, you're old enough now you are gonna go to the big house. What, really? I'm gonna go on down just right past this crick, and you're gonna get this thing outta here. Do you understand? (tires rumbling) Now git! (Bubba grunts) Go, go, go! It's battery-operated, come on. Attaboy. Get in. All right, let's go. I'm proud of you, Bubba. Let's go get some ice cream. (solemn music) (Bigfoot grunting) (static buzzing) (TV chatter) Hello, I'm Screens.

(TV beeping) (people shouting) (suspenseful electronic music) (TV chatter) (slow pop music) (Bigfoot grunting) (TV beeping) No, no! (thrilling music) (TV beeping) [Announcer] It's the Dr. Dawn Show in 3D. With your host, Dr. Dawn. Tonight's special guest, Penny Blossom. And tonight's topic is none other than Bigfoot as usual. Hello, Dr. Gail. Hi, I'm Dr. Dawn, doctor of parapsychology, doctor of internal medicine and sometimes surgery. And I'm here with my very special guest, Penny Blossom. Hi! And tonight we're gonna be talking about Bigfoot. Yay. So Penny, you think you actually so Bigfoot? Oh, I know I saw him. My friends doubted me, but I was up near Sacramento. I was panning for gold 'cause you know, I'm a gold digger. (giggles) And there he was in the distance, and my friend said, "No, that's not Bigfoot." And I said, "It is, I know it's Bigfoot." He's a big and handsome, young looking ape and... (laughs) I didn't know what to do, and then he disappeared. Oh, was he handsome? Was he really handsome? Was he really hairy chest and everything? Oh! - Oh my God. My viewers know that I wrote a bestseller. It's called Bigfoot and Dr. Dawn: The True Love Story. And we have been communicating, telepathically. He's been coming every night in my dreams. And so we're going to be going and finding him. So are you excited to be on this expedition with us, Penny? I am so excited. Be still my beating heart. (women giggling) (Bigfoot grunting) We've had a few expeditions before, and some of the girls didn't make it, unfortunately. Last time we had a bear incident. But this time's gonna be really good 'cause we have our guns locked and loaded and ready to go. Yes? - I have my crossbow. And I don't wanna kill Bigfoot, but I, we need to be protected. Oh no, we're not gonna kill him. No, no, no, we're gonna, we're gonna find him. We're gonna lure him in. We're gonna seduce him. And we're gonna have a relationship, right? That's right. I'm gonna finish my fantasy book about him because, oh wow. He's so big and handsome. And, oh, I can't wait to just to meet him and have him hold me in his arms, and his big, hairy, his big hairy chest against mine. Oh, just to make out and kiss with him and ooh, ooh!

That looks like a piece of crap! [Together] Bigfoot's crap! Oh God, what are we gonna do? We can't touch it. - Okay, I got an idea. Let's put our energy together, and transport it forward to 2050. That's it, that's it. [Together] Beyond ho, away we go. Beyond ho, away we go. Beyond ho, away we go. Beyond ho, away we go. Holy crap, we're gonna be trillionaires! I love it! (women squealing) Oh my God, that was a big one! (somber music) Oh my God. - Oh wow. - What is that? It's a hoof print. Looks like I'm finally gonna get my selfie. [dawn] It's so big. And you know what they say about men with big feet? My ex-boyfriend had big feet, definitely worth it. This monster probably has pretty big hands too. He's close by. Let's go find him. Let's get that selfie for you. Let's get the selfie. Let's go get this fool, ladies. [Penny] I think she's definitely from the loony bin. [Daisy] Oh yeah, that's plausible. You know what, we set out to find Bigfoot. Let's just go look for him. We'll find her on the way. Ladies, I think at this point we really gotta accept there ain't no Bigfoot! (suspenseful music) (Bigfoot grunting) (footsteps pattering) (water rushing) [Tilly] We may never see that girl again. - Yeah. - She's lost forever probably. She may be gone for good. (women scream) Jesse! Where have you been? Don't give me that look, I know that look. - Bitch! - I know, I know, I know. I got up early this morning, and I was inspired. And I always like to write when I'm inspired. And I wrote a song for our quest to get Bigfoot. - For what? - We were worried about you. I wrote a song. I know, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, but you'll love the song. So you wrote a song? Of course, it's about all of us. All right. - Actually. - Can we hear the song? - I wanna hear it. - Yeah. - You ready? - Yeah. Now I wrote it with like a Western spaghetti, Southern twang kind of a feel to it.
