Sky darkened all over and sudden murders it seems Speak like a policeman Don't behave like a common man There are no fingerprints on even 1 of the 6 murdered victims We didn't find a single foot imprint around any of the bodies In the autopsy report All 7 bones are shattered in every victim's neck But not even a single hand impression Victims were found dead near kora grass, cemetery, an independent house Under a bridge, on the branch of a tree and near a small pond In 6 different places The distance between all the bodies was at least 1/2 a kilometer But there wasn't any vehicle marks at all 6 victims were murdered at the same time according to post-mortem report But how is this realistically possible? 'We are left with many such puzzling questions' This case isn't as simple as it seems It's unusual, sir [strange whispering] [dog howling] 'From the time the skies darkened during the day' '...I've been enquiring only about this case' 'It has been 48 hours' 'I didn't even go home' 'It is really frustrating, sir' I understand your problem, Balraj Only because of the remote location of this area ...the Press & Media haven't got wind of this So we are safe 'Please go home now' 'Take adequate rest and come back in the morning' 'Analyse thoroughly what our next step should be' 'Definitely we may get some clue' [mobile ringing] Hello, sir Kozhandhai, we were clueless and in the dark till now, right?

I haven't heard of it Sir, this is a rare blood group This was discovered first in Surat Also known as Mumbai blood Less than 1 million people in India according to a survey share this group Why is this group called Bombay blood? Sir, because this blood group is found mostly in Gujarat and Maharashtra regions No other region? So far not in any other region according to our survey, sir We found 2 types of blood groups from the samples we took As per the autopsy report victim's blood group is O+ve Another one is HH blood group - Okay, doctor, thank you - You're welcome - Kozhandhai - Sir? Murderer's blood group has to be HH - Kumar - Sir Get total survey report of HH blood group Sir, now this problem has travelled from here to Mumbai? I'm totally confused Looks like this will lead us on a wild goose chase, sir You are right, Kozhandhai Even I am frustrated That's why I told you on day 1 Today is considered an inauspicious day for Lord Bhairava, so don't join duty Did you pay heed to my words? Look at our plight now A crow fell down dead the day you came here A murder of crows descended on the house like the plague! Baby Thiya is suffering from rashes Pet dog is missing Sir, and the anti climax in all these disturbing events Some female has taken your wife's form and misused you! Only this piece of startling news Only this has been disturbing me every minute and second It is also the only reason I'm unable to focus on this case - Kozhandhai - Sir Send a cop to take my wife and child to your house - Okay, sir - Bring the police dog to my house at once - Okay, sir - Let's go Hello, listen to me carefully You should be here in 2 minutes Sir, Maya the dog is on the way Okay, spread the bed sheet on the bed, I shall be back Spread the bed sheet? Kozhandhai, bring the dog and make it sniff this bed sheet I'll wait in the lawn If my guess is right that dog will come in search of me - Kozhandhai - Yes, sir She must have been here Kozhandhai Sir - Check this entire area - Okay, sir What, sir? Everything here is made of wood! You are right, sir But not even a single object has been attacked by termites - Take photos of everything here - Okay, sir Selvam, please come here Looks like Arabic font 'Sir, look at the pictures drawn here' - Sir, it is a dog - Next? Termite - Kozhandhai - Sir Something is happening on a much bigger scale than we thought Kora grass was the first crime spot Fish Inspector saw this and howled like a dog after self immolation This must have been responsible for his death too My pet dog is also missing What is actually happening here? Danny...! Hey Danny Kozhandhai, Danny is here 'What are you saying?' But he looks very different from the Danny we know What happened, sir? Careful! Danny Kozhandhai Danny He seems to be in a murderous rage Caught my leg, sir - Kozhandhai, move - Save me, sir Go [dog growling] What is the total count of people with HH blood group? Sir, 917303 How can we find the person we are looking for in this list? We can, Kozhandhai - Separate the females in this list - Sure, sir Number of females is 3,67,583, sir The girl who came to my house in my wife's form could be... ...between 25 and 30 years Get the list of girls in that age group Sir, it is 13,186 13,186! Tell me, Kozhandhai Now can we find the girl we are looking for? Chances are there Listen everybody Driving licence of these 13,186 girls Voter ID and Aadhar card And any other Govt ID proof Search and find immediately Yes, sir Check this ID card 1 minute - What is this? - Signature, sir Signature, huh? Enlarge it Sir, even in that house it was written like this in Arabic Basically when someone signs ...it will either be in English or in their mother tongue If it is in Arabic- Is Arabic her mother tongue? Exactly, sir What is her name? Shikara, sir Shikara, huh? The name of that place is also Shikapura Halli Please enlarge that photo Is this the girl we are looking for? There is a way to verify that How, sir? Thiya...? Yes, daddy Are you alright, darling? Feeling better, daddy But I'm feeling very tired, daddy Then why are you straining, dear? I have a lot of studies to catch up on, daddy Thiya Thiya Have you met the person in this photo anywhere? - Chelli - Tell me, dear 'Have you seen her?' Chelli Excuse me, sir Don't do this Have you seen her anywhere? - Chelli - Thiya 'Stop it' DAI! HOW MANY TIMES WILL YOU ASK ME? I AM RIGHT HERE Thiya, it's daddy I am your daddy Your dad Thiya What happened, Thiya? Thiya, there's nothing wrong with you 'Allah not only knows you, but your mind too...!' 'Holy Quran 4:63' 'Allah not only knows you, but your mind too...!' 'Holy Quran 4:63' 'Holy Quran 4:63' 'Holy Quran 4:63' 16:113 Means? 'Holy Quran' 'When you see this looks like just before his death' '...he has urgently written some clue with a thorn' He is trying to convey something to us Sir, your guess was right In chapter 16 - Sentence 113 exists, sir - Please read it 'And there had certainly come to them a messenger from among themselves' 'But they denied him' 'So punishment overtook them while they were wrongdoers' What does this mean, sir? A messenger came But they did not accept him So punishment overtook them Before this happened... ...a seer aware of everything must have visited this place Not trusting him, the villagers must have chased him away That is why so many problems plague this village - Kozhandhai - Sir About this village... ...is there anyone living here who knows everything about it? The only man who knows top to bottom about our village... ...is Ambuliraj working in our file section, sir Ambuliraj, sir I know a man who fits your requirement Where can I meet him? There is a forest path 5 km from here 'Beyond that flows a river' 'After crossing the river...' '...if you climb up the western hill' '...you can find him at that hill top, sir' Looks like there is no path beyond this point, sir It is blocked I can see a hut over there But can't see anyone around Come, Sivabala Did you find it very tough to reach here? Sivabalan How do you know- Aiya, his name is Chezhiyan No, Kozhandhai Till I was 5 years old I was called only Sivabalan Aiya, how did you know this name? In this world only human beings have the power to change nature If man decides he can destroy this world Or can keep it healthy and safe But man uses such a vital power only to eat and sleep peacefully Other than that... ...you should learn to read the mind One who has studied the mind... ...can become a seer or sibyl When that happens, everyone can find out about everything You are right A small clue on Mouliyar's hand brought us to you What is the relationship between you and Mouliyar? Mouli is my disciple He learnt yoga from me Our investigation suggests a female is responsible for all these murders But what was her motive? Evil spirit around her We still don't have answers When Silas begin their magical games this will be the outcome Sila...sila...? Mouliyar also mentioned the same name What do you mean by Sila's magical games? Like how God created human beings along with other living things He also created certain bad spirits for humans to realise the good Such an evil power created by God is Sila It is said God created Jinn through fire And man using soil according to Quran Sila is also a Jinn In local slang she is devil incarnate Sila was born in Surat Why should she come to Shikapura Halli? And why kill innocent people? 'Hundreds of years ago Jinns lived here' 'These evil spirits love darkness and cold' In terms of global conditions Shikapura Halli has both in abundance 'So they wanted to claim possession of this village' 'Going against God, they tried to convert the entire village...' '...as habitat for Jinns who follow the devil's culture' 'Even though few fell prey to it' ...many opposed it Really? My God! Okay, be patient Save us O' Allah In the holy month of Ramadan... ...on the Night of Decree Laylat al-Qadr ...when God's power at night is to the brim and overflowing Hands of all these evil spirits. the Jinns were tied by God In that moment of darkness when they lost all their evil powers 'Few God-men who were in our village' ...planned to kill the remaining 6 Jinns 'And unto you peace' In case we are destroyed ...it is only a temporary state The six of us will be reborn We will surround this village Shroud it in darkness and destroy it Until then... ...we'll spread jinn society to this whole world 'SO BE IT!' 'Allahu Akbar' 'God is great!' 'In the name of God' Those 6 Jinns swore to destroy this village by being born again here But they couldn't be born as humans 'Kora grass with 1 sense' 'Fish with 2 senses' 'Termites with 3 senses' 'Snake with 4 senses' 'As a dog with 5 senses' They were born again and again 'Is that why, grass, fish, termites, snake and dog disturbed us to this extent?' Surprisingly only one of them '...survived the earthquake in Gujarat' 'She was born as a human obviously with 6 senses' 'In the ashram where she was raised...' '...while other kids were yearning and crying for mother's love and milk' '...this child alone sat alone without shedding a single tear' 'She was very weird!' 'Everyday that child had some thought or the other which she expressed' 'Without her knowledge she started drawing weird pictures at a young age' 'Looking at her complexion' '...the other children ridiculed her cruelly' 'Just look at her' 'That affected her mentally' Hey white-washed girlie! 'That child started to use black 'kohl' on her fair complexion' 'She was so stunned the flames did not burn her hand' 'Why are things happening like this around me?' 'The question 'Who am I?' started to plague her mind' 'Ordinary words and sights enjoyed by others had a repulsive effect on her' [Islamic prayer] 'She started to read a book on Jinn' 'She felt closer to living things with 1,2,3,4 and 5 senses' 'Suddenly one day she had a dream' 'In that dream...' '...incidents of many births ago became crystal clear to her' 'She saw herself in that dream' 'After that...' '...she began to draw what she saw in her dream' 'Incidents that happened to her many births ago...' '...she felt it realistically' Born as a human being Stepping into adulthood Within a specific time frame 'She realises she is a Jinn and not a human being' 'After realising that...' '...she switches to the same robe her ancestors wore' 'To the outside world clad in a black robe' '...she starts wearing the white robe in her habitat' 'Realising there is no point living here' '...and Shikapura Halli is her hometown' 'She navigates to her homeland' The moment she stepped on the soil of Shikapura Halli... '...the skies enveloped this village in darkness' 'People who tortured 5 living beings...' '...were cruelly murdered by her' 'She killed the inspector who was investigating the case' 'And Mouliyar who came to help you' Why didn't she kill me like she killed the one who held my post before me? Instead why did she come in my wife's form and have- You belong to a family lineage of spiritual efficacy and power of penance 'She saw the mole on your chest in the form of the sun' To conceive a baby through you And to destroy the fetus in the womb is called 'Garba-bali' To destroy a fetus in the womb before its normal gestation period ...this world will belong to darkness 'She has written that in her heart in Arabic' Normal gestation period for a woman is 10 months But for a 'Sila' it is just 28 days! Only few hours left for that 28th day to begin The sun sets today at sharp 6:06 p.m If she aborts the fetus at that same minute If she offers your daughter as sacrifice ...her power will increase multi-fold Using that power... ...she will change the remaining 5 living things into human beings She will surround this village, shroud it in darkness and destroy it That is why she mesmerised your daughter by licking her face Tonight is when our Prophet was given a 'Buraq', a mythical winged horse The whole of today they will recite the 'dhikr' Today her power will only be as much as you can fight But you will not be able to kill her The moment she knows you know the truth of her present birth ...she would have changed her form for sure Insha Allah May God be with you Praise be to Allah Lord of the Universe! Sir, what form has she taken and where will she be? When we have no clue of either how will we identify her? In the short time frame at our disposal it is impossible to find her, I know Before that, ask Constable Jayasri to escort Regi and Thiya to Hill house Okay, sir How do we find her- I have a plan to make her come looking for us What is it, sir? I'll let you know Sir, what is this? The skies are darkening for the 3rd time [mobile ringing] - Hello - 'Hello, Chelli' 'Thiya is-' 'Hill house 2,210 meters above sea level' Regi, what has happened to Thiya? Where is she? Thiya! Thiya! Is she our Thiya? Thiya darling Thiya Don't go too close, sir Wait, man Thiya - Thiya - Don't go near her, sir Sir, don't...don't Cool...cool, Thiya Thiya Don't worry, Thiya Calm down, you're fine Thiya, your dad is here with you What is happening, dear? Why are you behaving so strangely? Why are you doing this? Tell me what you feel Chelli, why did you bring us here? Be patient I'll explain everything Thiya, you will be fine Thiya...Thiya Chelli, look over there 'Allah! There is no God but He' How did he come here? Don't get tense We misunderstood him Everytime he came was to help us Even now he's here because I called him He will cure our child for sure Thiya, bear the pain You will be fine soon 'Who is he that intercedeth with Him save by His leave?' You won't be harmed, dear 'He knoweth what appeareth to His creatures' '...as before or after or behind them' 'Nor shall they compass aught of His knowledge except as He willeth' Thiya, don't be scared 'His Throne doth extend over the heavens and the earth' 'He feeleth no fatigue in guarding and preserving them' I'm here, you will be alright '...except as He willeth' Thiya, listen to me 'His Throne doth extend over the heavens and the earth' Thiya 'He feeleth no fatigue in guarding and preserving them for...' 'He is the Sublime, the Tremendous' Please bear this for a little bit longer - Thiya - What is this, sir? I had only 1 way to find her, Kozhandhai She can't bear it if those 5 living things are in danger She will somehow come out of hiding to stop that I thought she will attack me Instead she has used Thiya- [surat al-baqarah; verse 2:225] - Kozhandhai - Sir? She may come here anytime soon In any form too Thiya Thiya, let go of him Listen to me, let go Thiya 'Don't kill him Listen to me' Let go of him Thiya Hey Thiya - 'Chelli! - Regi?' 'Where are you?' 'Sir, where is Thiya?' 'Chelli, where is our daughter?' - 'Thiya - She is missing, sir' 'Thiya, where are you?' Thiya Sir, look at his leg! Thiya Thiya Regi, back Chelli WE WILL SURROUND THIS VILLAGE SHROUD IT IN DARKNESS AND DESTROY IT COMPLETELY 'Thiya' 'What is this?' Fresh blood, sir Chelli, Thiya will be fine, right? Sir I am even more petrified ever since I saw that Jinn, sir Regi, don't panic Nothing will happen to us She's gone, sir DADDY! Thiya Thiya, where are you? Thiya...Thiya? Thiya Sir Regi Chelli...Chelli? Open the door Chelli Chelli Regi, I'm trying, wait Daddy Thiya Chelli Chelli Sir...sir? Sir? Where are you, sir? Daddy? Thiya? Thiya darling? Can you hear your dad's voice? Thiya darling, where are you? - Thiya? - Daddy! Where are you? Thiya...wait, daddy will come and save you Thiya, I am coming Sir...sir - Daddy - Thiya Don't be scared I'm here to get you Thiya Thiya!! Thiya! Daddy! - Thiya - Daddy? Daddy, don't shake I will fall down Daddy, don't shake I am terrified, daddy Daddy, I will fall down Be brave, dear Don't let go "In the name of God Almighty Immense thanks to the all mighty" Thiya, hold on to the rod Where are you, Kozhandhi? Where are you, sir? - Hold my hand - Daddy, I will fall down Save me, daddy Thiya - Thiya - Daddy? Save me, daddy Don't cry, dear I'm there for you Thiya, wait, my dear I'll drag you to safety Don't look down, dear Don't loosen your grip - Aiyo! Don't - Thiya! Daddy Mummy Don't let go of your grip Kozhadhai - Chelli! - Sir...!! I'm scared, daddy Snuff the fire, Kozhandhai Open the tap, Kozhandhai Daddy, my hands are paining I'm absolutely petrified, daddy When I pour water, the flames intensify even more It's burning as a green color sir This doesn't look like ordinary fire, sir This fire seems so different, sir 'It is said God created Jinn through fire' 'And man using soil according to Quran' I can't hold on any longer My hands are aching, daddy Daddy, I'm scared Daddy, save me 'The sun sets today at sharp 6:06 p.m' 'If she aborts the fetus at that same minute' 'If she offers your daughter as sacrifice' '...her power will increase multi-fold' Only 1 minute remaining, sir Chelli Daddy - Chelli! - Daddy, save me Thiya, I'll hold you tight Don't be scared - Chelli, what are you doing? - Sir! Don't be scared, Thiya Sir, don't! "In the name of God Almighty Immense thanks to the all mighty" Thiya!! Kozhandhai, we have only 30 seconds left She should not win whatever the reason Before she can kill my child I'll do it with my bare hands No...no! - Don't, daddy - Forgive your dad, Thiya NOOOOOO! Don't worry You are fine, dear How is she burning, sir? When the green flames licked her feet Thiya didn't say they were burning She only said her hands were aching Daddy, help! I knew right then this fire won't harm human beings This fire created Jinns I realized And only this fire can destroy Jinns - That's exactly what happened - Then why did she create a green fire? To delay, waiting for the right moment and get the weapon to kill the fetus Why has she come, sir? Man is the best of God's creations All the jinns should bow their heads to humans, it is said so in Hadhees The reason I attribute to it is... ...the 6th sense God has bestowed on humans Only that 6th sense has saved Thiya from you It has destroyed you too "If you destroy a fetus in the womb equal to our world being dark as a tomb"
