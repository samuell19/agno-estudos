Any word from him? - Not a single word. We've been having a line in for him all afternoon, but it seems they can't locate him! Here, drink this. I've been keeping alive on it. - But what is he doing in London all this time? When is he coming up to Paris? After all, we're only human. He can't do this to us! Call him again. - Allo, allo? Paris, calling Mr. Paul Reynard. - Yeah, put him on. - Put Reynard on, Dirk. We won't be put off any longer! We know he's there. Well, if he isn't, where is he? - He hasn't shown up and I can't locate him, and as far as I know, he's been snatched by the devil. - Aren't you being just a few years premature, Dirk? - Oh, chief, where have you been? Why, Paris has been calling all day, and they'll be calling in a minute. The whole world's been calling. They refuse to give up the wire until you speak to them. - I'll speak to them. Hello? - Hello, Reynard. What's the matter with you, keeping us in the dark like this? What do you think we're made of? - You're impatient, my dear Charles. Very impatient. - Well, of course I'm impatient. Did the loan go through? - My dear Charles, you shouldn't become so excited. Think of your heart. Think of your liver. - I'm not interested in my liver but in the loan, the loan! Did you get the loan? If you have failed for us in London, you know what it means. - I'm not in the habit of failing. - You mean you got it? - Certainly. Things couldn't be better. - Well, then why didn't you let us know? - Well, because it only happened a few minutes ago. - You heard. He got it. - But you didn't get the loan. Why did you tell him you did? - Because, my dear Dirk, you can tell wolves the truth and tigers the truth, but you must never tell sheep the truth. If you do, they'll set up a most unpleasant bleating, like this: "Baa!" Oh, it's most unpleasant. - Yes, but they turned you down here the same as in Paris. Now what's next? - Go back to Paris and try to get the money again there. - Paris? Why, that's the one place you shouldn't go to. Why, when this thing breaks, it'll rip the town wide open. You've gotta hide somewhere until the worst is over. - And leave Irene to face the music by herself? - How can you help her by putting your head in the noose? - Who said that I was going to? I tell you, there's a way out. There always is. - He has left Croydon in his plane and is flying back to Paris. - Pleasant flight, isn't it? - Look here, chief. Please turn back. I tell you, you're speeding 200 miles an hour to ruin and jail. This thing has gotten too big. Not even you can beat it. Even if you think you can, don't be a bullhead. Tell the pilot to take us back and we'll- - What's the matter? Afraid, like the others? - Aw, it's not myself. I'm nobody, nothing could happen to me. But it's you. - You know, Dirk, I really think you would care if something happened to me, wouldn't you? - Well, of course. After all, I've been through a lot with you in 10 years. Now, there's Paris. We've still got time to turn back, chief. - I tell you, there's still a way out. Yes, of course. Of course there is. I knew there was. - What is it? - Honesty! It never occurred to me to try it. Honesty's my ace in the hole. The point is this. You gentlemen are going to lend me 100 million francs. - Reynard! - Why, he's mad. - 100 million francs? - Why doesn't he ask for a billion? - We thought you called us here because you had something sensible to say, Reynard. Why, there isn't a man in this room who hasn't already refused you a credit of one franc more. - Which is precisely why we are aware of your situation. - Monsieur Lamartine, how much of my securities do you hold as collateral for my loans? - 50 million francs. - And you? - The same, 50 million. - Monsieur? - 12 million. - In your vaults, gentlemen, you hold my collaterals for loans to me in the sum of 200 millions. Some of those securities are very good. But unfortunately, most of them are forged. They're not worth the paper they're written on. You're joking, Reynard. - In all honesty, those securities are forged. - Forged? He's ruined me! - You thief! Why, I'll kill you! Silence! Silence! Force will get us nowhere! - Monsieur Lamartine is quite right. You'll get nowhere if you act like children. And now, messieurs, I think it is obvious that you're going to lend me 100 million francs. - I think it's obvious that we are not. We shall deliver you over to the police. - And deliver your stockholders over to ruin? As practical men, you should know that your one chance of remaining solvent yourselves is to keep me solvent. Well, gentlemen, what are you going to do? - We can't settle such an important question on the spur of the moment. - No, no, no, naturally not. I, uh... I think I'm reasonably safe for a few hours. May I suggest that you send me word of your decision before midnight? - Very well. Before midnight. - Good. And now, gentlemen, if you'll excuse me, I'll leave. I've been away for some time and this happens to be my wedding anniversary, and I'm naturally anxious to see my wife. Goodnight. - Madame? Will you wear the pink negligee? - Which is the most wicked? - The black, of course. - I'll wear the black. Lynette? Massage my head a little, will you? Oh, that's wonderful, Lynette. A man's hands could never be so gentle. Paul! Paul, I didn't see you! - Oh, confess. You thought it was your lover. - I did, and it was. Your flowers were lovely. - You liked them? - But I didn't like your being so late. - I know, my darling, but I couldn't help it. I've had a very hard day. - Oh, my poor angel. - It's curious that you should use that word, because while I was flying back here a strange thing happened. An angel, an actual angel, flew into the plane, crying bitterly, and then flew out again. Well, I collected his tears, because I thought you might like to see them. - Oh, Paul! - For our first wedding anniversary. - Paul! Oh. Thank you, darling. - Oh, telephones. The enemies of romance. I'll answer it for you, dear. - Oh, Paul! Don't make any engagements. I forgot to tell you, the Lamartines are giving a special anniversary party for us tonight. - The Lamartines? - Uh-huh. - Oh. How very charming of them. Hello? Oh. It's nice of you to call. But my dear fellow, that's quite impossible. I'm going out tonight with my wife. - I say, you've got to see us at once. You tricked us. We checked up on that London business. You never did get that loan. - I really can't discuss the matter any longer with you now. Everything will be settled by morning. In fact, by midnight. Goodnight. - Is something wrong? - Strange. Very strange. - What? - Fear. That man I was talking to on the telephone was frightened. Of what? I've never been afraid of anything in my life. I don't know what it means to be frightened. - But I do, when you look like that. - You? You, frightened of me? - Yes, often. When you get that strange look. That crazy look in your eyes! Oh, never look like that again, please! Never! - Oh, my darling. My darling. I never will. I may need you later. Stay close to the bar. - That won't be hard. - Bonsoir, Monsieur Reynard. Bonsoir, madame. - Bonsoir, bonjour. Did you sell your airplane shares? - I won't until you tell me, monsieur. - Better take a profit. I'm not infallible, you know. - Monsieur Reynard. - Hello, Paul. - Good evening. Good evening, Andre. How are you, Grace? - Irene, will you sit there? Paul, you sit here. - That's Reynard's wife. A year ago, she sang here professionally. - How is Madame Lamartine this evening? How are you, Adrienne? - Well, I seem to be more settled than you are. Only yesterday I read you were in New York. Or was it Hong Kong? - Both. I travel by magic carpet. - Paul, you get more wicked-looking all the time. And your wife more beautiful. - Well, that's just as it should be, isn't it? Think what a world this would be if husbands became more beautiful and wives more wicked. - We did so want to help you and Irene celebrate tonight, Paul. I'm so glad that you returned from London in time to make it possible. - I'm glad myself. Only, uh, I seem to miss an old friend of mine named Monsieur Lamartine. - Oh, he'll be here soon. He was detained. - Nothing serious, I hope. - Oh, just a little business problem. - I'm sure he'll solve it quickly. And successfully. - A toast, with our first glass of wine, to the first marriage anniversary of the most fascinating couple in Paris. May I have this dance, Madame Reynard? - Please pardon me, I claim the privilege of the first dance with my wife tonight. That is, if she will dance with me. - I might. Paul, you seem nervous about something. - How do you know? - Because you're so calm. What is it? Can't you tell me? - Darling, do you really expect me to talk business when I'm holding you in my arms? - There's Monsieur Lamartine. Darling, you're holding me much too close, and I love it. - Reynard! - Good evening. - Good evening, my dear. - Ah! Monsieur Lamartine. - Good evening. - Good evening. - Monsieur Reynard, I suppose I should apologize for being late. - Why, certainly not to me. I understand the sudden and unexpected demands of business. They crop up all the time, don't they? - Don't they though? - We must pour you a glass of champagne. - You might as well pour yourself one, Reynard. - You understand, of course, that champagne is the wine of celebration. One drinks it after victory. - Or as consolation for defeat. - What are you drinking to? - Honesty. - Your song. - Our song. ♪ Love opened my eyes ♪ ♪ And the sight I beheld was divine ♪ ♪ Love opened my eyes ♪ ♪ Yet I saw only you, love of mine ♪ ♪ I gazed at the skies ♪ ♪ Heaven seemed far away in the blue ♪ ♪ Love opened my eyes ♪ ♪ To a heaven on earth with you ♪ ♪ Take me in your arms tonight, hold me tight ♪ ♪ Till the moon fades away ♪ ♪ Show me that you're really real, not a dream ♪ ♪ That will fade with the day ♪ ♪ You were a surprise ♪ ♪ Yet I knew it was love at the start ♪ ♪ Love opened my eyes ♪ ♪ But I'm looking at you with my heart ♪ ♪ Love opened my eyes ♪ It's the police! ♪ But I'm looking at you ♪ ♪ With my heart ♪ They're arresting Reynard! - Where's Paul? - My poor child. - I'm ruined. Paul! - What extraordinary bad taste. I hope you'll at least allow me to say goodnight to my wife. - Impossible. Come along, please. - Paul! Paul! - Madame, these are the rules and they must be obeyed. Pass nothing to the prisoner, and no physical contact. You are allowed five minutes. - Paul. Paul, I- - Irene. We mustn't waste any of this precious time in pity. I must talk fast. Dirk. - Yes, chief? - Listen carefully. You're never to leave madame out of your sight. Guard her with your life. I never want her to be troubled by anything. She must learn to be happy again. - No, I can't. Not without you! - You must learn to forget. - Not me though, chief. Whether you're in Paris or behind the bars, I can't forget what you've done for me. - Good old Dirk. Who can tell? Perhaps someday we'll go up again together. All you have to know is that somewhere I'm alive and that I still depend on you. Because I know that I can, Dirk. - Anything, chief. Anywhere. - And remember, above all, madame. - I've got it, chief. - Irene. Irene, you mustn't go to pieces over me. Whatever happens, they can't crush me. Now and always, I am Paul Reynard. - I know that you have a wonderful spirit, Paul, but when I think of what you have to face- - It will be so much easier for me to face it since I know that you'll get along. At least you won't have to worry about money. The jewels I gave you are worth a fortune. - I gave up the jewels, Paul. Everything. - Tainted money? I wish you hadn't suffered from so much conscience. What are you going to do without money? - Paul, I'll work. I'll sing, I'll get along. But you- - Oh! I'll be the honored guest of the government. A special boat with a military escort takes me to my new home, a plantation in the tropics. A penal colony. They're still afraid of me, even now. They're rushing me there tonight. - Then I must go to. I must be near you. I must be somewhere where I can be close! - I forbid you to even speak of it. I won't have you sacrificed too. I'll be an old man when I get out. If I'm not, I'll be a fugitive. I'll be no good to you either way. You're a young woman. You have your life before you. I want you to live it, and the only way you can do that is to forget me. Get me out of your mind and your heart completely. - Paul! How can you talk that way now? You know that I can't forget you. That I don't want to! That I... - Chief, I can't read between the lines very well, but you don't mean to say that you want madame to divorce you? To lose her? - How else do you think I'm going to hold her for the next 10 years? One, two, three, pull! One, two, three, pull! Pull! - If I had pull, I wouldn't be here. - Oh, come on, we gotta keep trying. One, two, three, pull! Oh, stop shamming and get up. - What's the matter with him? - Can't you see? Thinks it's easier to faint than to work. - Come on, take him out of here. You haven't changed since you've been here, Reynard. - Every man must do his share. - You didn't think so when you lived off the world. - Come on, get me somebody who can do the work. - Be quiet! You don't give orders here, you take 'em! Fall in! Forward, march! - We must apologize for the towel, monsieur. It will be changed. Next month. Mail, let's go. - Come forward when your names are called. Ramiro. Chevalle. Delos. Marechal. - The last letter I got was 17 years ago. A bill from my tailor. - Pasteur. Blanc. - I don't even get a circular from my undertaker. - Be quiet, I want to hear the names. - Ferreira. Mjoll. Mendez. Chivas. - He's delaying mine on purpose. Reynard. Ramiro. Duval. Delos. Marechal. Pasteur. Blanc. Ferreira. Mjoll. Mendez. - "Patience." What can they know? Every hour is a day, every day is a week. Every week an eternity. - If only I could receive a letter. Any letter. - "Patience"! If something doesn't happen soon, I'll... - Ah, good evening, Señor Perreda. - Ah, Señor Perreda! This way, please! - Let me tell you something, Cap. When you're in the jungle, this is your best friend. -Hmm. What do they call it? - Machete. - Machete, huh? - Dirk. Where's the drinks for table six? - I don't know. They just lifted themselves off the bar and went out to get a little fresh air, I guess. - You pay more attention to sailors and barflies then you do to our carriage trade. Say, who do you think you are? - The best bartender you ever had. And I'll tell you something more. I can get a better job just like that. - Well, why don't you take it? - Because your pretty brown eyes hold me in a spell. - You think because the boss is sweet on your friend, Madame Irene, you gonna run this place. Someday I'm going to fire you. - Manuelo. Someday I'm going to fire you. Amazing. And you look so much like a man. - What do you mean? - I mean you're not a man at all, you're an old woman. You have the longest tongue in Rio de Janeiro. - Really, I didn't mean no harm. - What business is it of yours to couple Madame Irene's name with mine in public, even in private? It slipped out. It was the first time. - Oh no, it wasn't, but it's gonna be the last. Now, you take my advice and leave both Madame Irene and myself out of your conversation. - I assure you, señor, I have always told people there is absolutely nothing between you. Time after time I have said you are not the kind of man to pursue a woman month after month when she wouldn't have nothing to do with you. Yes, time after time. - Someday, I'm going to fire you. - Thank you. ♪ Oh, heart of mine ♪ ♪ Don't fall in love ♪ ♪ Don't let the stars that shine ♪ ♪ Fool you above ♪ ♪ In their spell before ♪ ♪ You know how you fell before ♪ ♪ Listen to me, heart of mine ♪ ♪ Or be fooled once more ♪ ♪ Oh, heart of mine ♪ ♪ Don't run away ♪ ♪ Though he may seem divine ♪ ♪ Hear what I say ♪ ♪ He will lead you on ♪ ♪ When you need him, he'll be gone ♪ ♪ Leaving only stars above ♪ ♪ Heart of mine ♪ ♪ Don't fall in love ♪ ♪ Heart of mine ♪ - Steel or matches, a bridge is a bridge. Oh! Did you see what he did? Oh, I'm... - Dirk! - I'm terribly sorry. Truly, I am. - Throw him out! - Oh no, don't. - Yes, throw him out! - Yeah, kick him out! - Oh, don't. Don't! - Apologize. Apologize. I wanna apologize to the lady, that's all. Must apologize. - I'll call for you tomorrow at 6. - You ought to have more important things to do. - Well, I like to know that you're safe. You know it was the chief's last order, and until he comes back- - That'll be along time, Dirk. - But we are making it easier for him. I made a few contacts with sailors and traders, and Paul's getting more tobacco. - Tobacco. Letters. Memories. - But at least he does know we're thinking of him. - Goodnight, Dirk. - Goodnight. - You sure this is where she lives? - Positive. - 'Cause I wouldn't like to apologize to the wrong person. - Yes, just a minute. Stop it, I'm coming. Who do you want to see? - Not you. Ah. There you are. I... I'm so glad you weren't hurt. I... I feel I should apologize for the way- - No, please. Don't steal my stuff. Madame Irene, you see before you the contrite figure of a man who has no other aim in life but to apologize to you. - Oh, get him a chair. - Oh, no, no. Please, please. I wanna say it on my feet. I stand before you... I stand... Oh. - Maria, have you had any experience with a gentleman in this condition? - Yes, my husband, but he was no gentleman. - Well, what is one supposed to do? - Well, one's supposed to do nothing. They sleep it off. - Cover him with something. Yeah, poor thing. - And leave the gate open. Good morning, señor! Madame wants to know if you care to have a cup of coffee before you leave. - Oh, I see. Madame wants to know if I'd like to have a cup of coffee before I leave. Yes. - Would you tell me something in confidence? - Yes, señor. - What day is this? Today? It's Tuesday. - Tuesday? - Tuesday! Tuesday. And madame wants to know- - If you care to have a cup of coffee before you leave! - Would you be so kind as to tell madame that I think on this particular Tuesday that I'll just skip the cup of coffee? - Oh, you don't want? - No, I don't want. - You don't want no coffee? - No. - I'll tell madame you don't want today your coffee. I will tell her. - Madame wants to know if I want a cup of coffee. Madame wants to know if I want a cup of coffee. Good morning. - Shh! Quiet. Madame wants to know if I want a cup of coffee. - Good morning! Sure you don't want a cup of coffee before you go? - No, no, I think I'll just- - A cup of coffee will do you a lot of good, I'm sure. - Well, now that you mention it, I... I might possibly use a little brandy. - Brandy always comes after coffee. Doesn't it? - Yes, it does. Thank you. Well, it certainly is a relief for a change to have a nice, quiet family breakfast with no poor relations or strangers around. Isn't it, clear? - Uh, well, yes! It's such a relief. Aren't you curious to know how you got here? - Well, yes, as a matter of fact, I am, but... I don't know, something tells me I'd better not ask. - You came here to apologize. - I did? - Mm-hmm. - Well, don't tell me for what. - All right, I won't. - Hot biscuits. Hot biscuits. Hot biscuits! - You know, you oughta teach that maid not to giggle in the morning. Giggling's bad enough at any time, but in the morning it's positively immoral, positively. You're not listening to a word I'm saying. - Oh, yes, I am. - Not a word. We might as well really be married. - Well, I was wondering about you. - About me? Oh. Yes, Gregory is the name. William T. Gregory. Male, white, American, and repulsively handsome. In case you couldn't tell by looking at me. - I can tell much more than that by looking at you. - You can? What can you tell? - You don't care much about women. You don't care much about men. You don't care much about anything. But I'm sure there must've been a time when you cared a great deal about everything. - You know, for a minute, señora, I thought that I was gonna get my coffee and biscuits and my drink for nothing. Not even for the story of my downfall. Oh, yes. It was too much to expect. - Well, I didn't ask for anything. - Oh, no, no. I know, I know. Well, I'll be a good sport. I'll come through. You see, it was like this. Once, I was the happiest man in the world. I lived in a little rose-covered cottage, with the sweetest, dearest, prettiest wife that any man ever had. 50 years we traveled life's road together, and never a cross word. And at night, she used to sit under a lamp and play and play the piano. And when she was through playing, I used to tune the piano. Oh, that was my profession, you know. I was a piano tuner. Oh, yes. In fact, I think I can safely say without boasting that I was a very prominent piano tuner. Probably the most prominent piano tuner in the United States. Why, people used to bring their pianos on the backs for miles just to have me tune them. Oh yes, I was rolling in gold. Of course, not in public, mind you. Oh, no. No, I was too smart for that. But in the evening when the shades were drawn, I used to get out my gold and roll in it. Yes, roll in it. But then... Well, then came that dreadful day. - Yes? What day? - The day when the radio was born. The day when the American people discovered that they'd rather listen to static in the air than to Beethoven at home. Well, I was ruined overnight. I was called before the regiment and my tuning fork broken before my very eyes. Oh, you can imagine what it did to me. And my wife, my wife of 50 years, good ol' Darby, took to a jitterbug. - Oh! - And I took to drink. Drink, that curse of man. Gets you by the throat. Incidentally, how about my brandy? Oh, it gets you by the throat. Well, that's all I have to say. That's the sad, sad story of this empty shell you see before you. The sad story of this mere husk of a man. - I have read another story about you. Just this morning. It's on a cafe note. "An unpleasant scene was staged last night in the Cafe Samba by William Gregory, whose unwelcome presence in Rio de Janeiro should be noted by authorities. He is the American engineer and builder of the great Tapajos River bridge which collapsed recently just previous to its completion." - That's a lie. "Collapse." How could it? There was corruption in the buying of the materials and they put the blame on me. - Sometimes things happen which no man can control. Or woman. You ought to go back to your own people. - I'd rather be dead than go back to the States! Look. I've caused you some trouble, and you've been very nice about it. Now forget me. I'm not worth worrying about. Oh, did I think you? Oh yes, I did. And just two things I'd like you to know. First of all, I'm a heel. And second, you're probably a darn swell girl. - Any news about Santos? - I heard he made it. - I heard he didn't. - Aw, every time somebody makes a break, you hear these stories for weeks. "They made it." "They didn't make it." But the only way we find out what really happened, is when some- Mail! Mail! - This month's mail. Come forward when your names are called, and step lively. Cabrero. Portas. Labelle. Bateau. Matos. Santos. No use calling his name. There, that's all there was. Dismissed. - What do you mean, "all"? It can't be! - Be quiet. Do you want to go to solitary? - There must have been one! You've lost it with your stupidity! I demand my letters! - Well, well, the head of Reynard Incorporated demands his morning mail. - I tell you, I get letters every month! - This month you didn't. Can I help it if your little dove found someone else? - You! You! - Don't you know when you're dead, Reynard? A woman don't wait 10 years for a dead man. Not unless she's a fool! - Look! - Santos? - That's what the identity tag said. It's about all that's left of him. - How far did he get? - Seven miles. - Pretty good in that jungle. - Ants or buzzards? - One started, the other finished. When are you boys gonna get some sense? - Poor Santos. He thought he could make it this time. Poor fool. - Poor fool? To try and get out of this? To get somewhere? To someone? It can't be that she's found someone else. - Don't torture yourself, Paul. In the beginning, I used to think of my girl. Then I learned she married. Later, I used to think of my mother. Then she died. Now I don't think. I just sleep. - I never thought that I could miss a human being so much. I've gotta get out of this place. - Shh! Even you couldn't get far. You can't beat this jungle. Forget about it, Paul. - I was always lucky. And I will be again. - Irene. Why are you sitting here? - Why? - At Carnival time we forget our personal troubles and just have a lot of fun. Why don't you forget yours? Just like the New Year, the heart is full of fun, the young look beautiful and the old look young, and everyone loves his neighbor. - An old American custom. You mind my cutting in? - I do, and I don't. - Well, that's the first bit of encouragement I've had in weeks. I'm absolutely in the trees now. - Better come down to solid ground. - Listen, madame, you can't talk that way to the Sheik of Araby.

Go on, I say. - I am finished. - Well, I'm not. I'm just beginning. How many times have I told you to keep your mouth out of things that don't concern you? - Señor, I am merely dust. - If you don't look out, you'll be six feet under. Saying that I, a man of my age, would be jealous of a woman. - Irene- - Oh no, don't. Please don't say it. Don't tell me. - Why not? - Because... Because I want so much to hear it, and I haven't any right. Oh, no! Oh, this is crazy. I never should've let this... It's all my fault. We must forget each other. - Forget each other? Why? - Oh, 'cause the world is all wrong. There is no music! There is no laughter! Because you're no good for me, and I'm no good for you. - Señor, you don't seem to understand. All the pump broke down. No water run through the pipes. The cattle will die. - Well, why don't you get somebody to fix it? - Not on these ranchos, señor. What we need is a real engineer. - Engineer! Who said engineer? My credentials, sir. Graduated with honors. Everybody predicted great things for me. I drew plans for a bridge across the Atlantic. Everyone says, "Perfect!" "Wait for a low tide and we'll start building." At your service, sir. Just let me build something. That's all I ask. Let me build something. - That wouldn't be a bad idea. - I think you got something there. - All right, the job is yours. I knew you'd come to me. For the man who spanned the Atlantic will go! Or, no. Won't go. Not till I get that whiskey, huh? Okay, thank you. - Take him to the ranch. - Build something, huh? - And keep him there. Build it. Uh-oh. Mustn't drink that stuff anymore. - Señor, if you're awake, I'll take you to the pump. - What pump? - The pump Señor Roberto hire you to fix. - Well, bring your pump to me. - That's hardly possible, señor. It weighs 40 tons. - I don't want to be inquisitive, but would you mind telling me who I am? - You said you were an engineer. - Well, if I said that, I lied. I used to be an engineer. I'm through. I couldn't build a wheelbarrow today. See? So you get somebody else, and tell me the way to get back to town. - Car leaves every other day. - Well, I'll walk then. - But señor, we must have more water. There's sickness in the house. My children, fever. - I'm sorry. One to each family, señora. - Why don't you give her a little more? You want to be responsible- - Señor. You think we like to do this? We got to! - All right, give her my share. I don't drink water anyway. Oh, this thing's no good. It's not a question of repairing it. It's a question of a complete irrigation system. Are there any streams in those mountains? - Si, señor. There's snow too. - You got a reservoir? - We have some wells, but they only last 48 hours at the most. - All right. We'll repair this temporarily. But what you really need is a dam. - You can close up, Dirk, as soon as you are through. - Thank you, sir. - Brandy. - I'm sorry, old timer, but the bar's closed. I have some water, if you like. - I need brandy. I want brandy, and that's what you'll serve me. - Listen, old man. If it's help you need in getting outta here- - I don't need any help. But Paul does. - Paul? - Paul Reynard. - Did you say brandy? - Goodnight, Dirk. Don't work too hard. - Oh, I'll see you tomorrow. - That's the trouble. - What do you know about Paul? - We were colleagues. Chained together on the same lumber gang. - How did you get out? Served the full sentence. They want me to die on my own time. Maybe I'll fool them. - All right now. What did you say about Paul? - There won't be any Paul if he doesn't get out. He's crazy. He wants to break loose. He thinks he can do it if he had some help from the outside. - Yeah? How can that be arranged? Here, some more brandy. -Hmm. There are ways, and I know them. - Aren't you going to take me home, Dirk? - Why, of course, sure. - Oh, perhaps you're still busy. - Well, I won't be long, madame. Would you mind waiting in the car? - Please hurry. I'm tired. - Hmm. Now I understand. I saw her picture outside. Madame Irene, yeah? I understand. - You were telling me there are ways. - Me, I'd be heading for the nearest saloon. - It was heading for a saloon that brought me here. - The way I figured it out, don't make much difference. Every time night comes when I was free, I'd say to myself, "What'll I do tonight?" Now I don't have to worry anymore. I know what I'm gonna do every night. - It's all in the breaks. - Hey, you two. Report to Rocco right away. - What does he want to see us for? We ain't done nothin'. - Aw, come on. - Wanna see us, Rocco? - Sure. It's always a pleasure to see Reynard Incorporated. - And that pleasure is always mutual. - There's a package here for you. You know what's in it? - Certainly. A saw and a code in cipher. - Something for you too. - For me? I wonder who could be... Let me see it. It's from my uncle! My uncle in Marseilles. Why, he hasn't sent me anything since, since... And now he's remembering me again. Can I open it? - Oh, no. Rocco must do that. He must examine everything. - Take it and get out. Both of you! Go on, get out of here. - Remember me telling you about my uncle in Marseilles? - Yes, I remember. Here, we're going to exchange gifts. - And now as we get ready to go down to the site of the dam, let us ask the good padre to bless the project that has been so ingeniously planned by our young engineer, Señor Gregory. - Oh God, by whose name all things are sanctified, pour forth thy blessing on this water. Benedictionum. Benedictionum. Benedictionum. - My friends, I'm sure we'd all like to show our appreciation for the man whose energy and brilliance has shown us that we have riches all around us, and taught us how to gather them in. I call for three cheers for Señor Gregory! Viva! - Viva! - Viva! - Viva! - Viva! - Viva! - Señor Gregory, I wonder if you'd be kind enough to sign the registry in our little church. We like to keep a record of our notable friends who visit us here. - I'll be glad to. - And perhaps madame would sign also? You'll find it in the vestry. - I've missed you terribly. - Yet you've worked hard, and with success to- - Oh, I was grateful for the job, it filled my days and occupied my mind, but nevertheless I've missed you. I kept seeing your face before me. One minute it was there, and the next, you were swallowed up by the crowd. But I've found you again- - Bill. - And I want... - I must get back. - Why did you come? - I had to. Roberto told me that you were doing miracles, that you were a changed man. I wanted to find out for myself. - I've waited for weeks until I could pull myself together. Weeks till I thought I had the right to speak to you. What's standing between us? Reynard? - Yes. - How can you let him? He's wrecked everyone's life, including your own. Do you still love him? - Bill, you can't pin me down by forcing me to answer. There are all kinds of love. Reynard fascinated me. And whatever he was to the world, he was good to me. Although sometimes he did frighten me horribly, and yet there was some kind of a terrible fascination, even in that. But that's all over. I don't love him anymore. - Well, then why don't you free yourself from him? - If I deserted Paul when he needed me most, I'd always be miserable. Oh, let's face this, Bill. There is no way out. I'm trapped. But I'm not going to let you be trapped with me. - Is that your final word? - It must be. - Think we've been missed? - No, not yet. - We can still turn back. Remember what happened to Santos. - Santos was a fool. Don't worry, I've arranged everything. - It's wonderful, the way you do things. You must have some great friends on the outside. - I have myself. Come on, we've still got two miles to do today. - Miles and miles and days and days. Maybe I can't last. - You've got to last, Mushy. Think of it! When we get out of this, we'll be free! Come on. - No Mushy, no Paul. 72 hours. - That gives Reynard Incorporated and his accomplice just time enough to reach the swamp and change their minds. But it may be too late. - My guess is they'll be here on their knees tomorrow, begging to be taken back. - Maybe yes, maybe no. Did you ever see a pair of skeletons walk? - Paul! It's no use. - Get your breath, you'll be all right. - I'm through. You go on. - I can't cut through the rest of this jungle alone. It'll take the both of us. Come on. Come on. - Please! Please, Paul, I can't. - Listen, Mushy. Only a few more miles ahead of us and a bath. Clean, warm water. Soap that is soothing to the skin. A tub all by yourself. - But I never had those. - Listen. Listen, Mushy. Fresh linen. Clothes that fit you, and food. Do you realize what it will mean to sit down to a civilized meal with a bottle of wine properly chilled? - But honest, Paul, I never had those. - Come on, Mushy. Come on. - Hey. Go away. We ain't dead yet. - You want something to eat? - No. I just wanna sit here. We really got through the worst of it. - Yes, we really got through the worst of it. - I just wanna sleep. Wake me up in a hundred years. But Paul? I ain't done nothin' to you. - On the contrary, you've done me a great favor. - In a few years, I could've gone back home. - Dirk! Dirk! Dirk! Dirk. Dirk! - Chief! Oh, chief. Chief! Oh, chief. I'm here, chief. Oh, just look at you. I've been hugging this coast for the last three weeks. I thought you'd never turn up. - Where's the boat? - Just down the river, not far from here. But chief, you're tired. Don't you think you ought to rest? - No, no, no need to rest. Let's go on. - You, in your message, you mentioned another man. Where is he? - He couldn't make it. Irene. You must lift yourself out of this mood. - I know, Roberto. I'm trying to. - I'll have to go in a few minutes. Course, you don't have to if you don't want to. - I want to. I think it would be better for me if I did. - Come in. - You know then? I won't say a thing now. - No. Please, not now. Madame Irene? - Come back here, after my number. Madame Irene! - Sing "After the Rain"! - "After the Rain"!

Any woman should be able to dress in two minutes. - In what country, my friend? - Paul. - Well? Haven't you anything to say to me? I... What can I say? I... I'm so overcome. - Are you? Then I think you might've given me a warmer greeting. A wife who hasn't seen her husband for such a long time, and who... Dirk tells me has been fully able to amuse herself. - I didn't amuse myself. I fell in love. I couldn't help it, Paul. I tried not to. - You are married to me. - I know it. - You can't possibly have forgotten everything that we meant to each other. - I haven't. - You don't know what it means to me to hold you in my arms again. - Let me go. - Why, am I so repulsive to you? - Yes, when I feel you touching me. Let me go! - You think that now. You think it, but you will forget this man. You'll forget him. - No, I won't, Paul. You're utterly wrong. - Right or wrong, you're going to stay married to me. We're leaving Rio tomorrow. I'm starting on a new career. With you, I'll be on top of the world again. Nothing can stop me, nothing can- Don't let anyone in. Irene? Open, please, it's Bill. I must see you at once. - Don't let him in. Tell him to go away. - Bill! - Yes? - I can't see you now. Go away, please! - Irene, please forgive me for barging in like this, but I was worried about you. There's a commotion outside. Police, official cars, all sorts of rumors. I just wanted to make sure you were safe, that's all. - I'll worry about my wife's safety, thank you, Mr. Gregory. - Paul Reynard. - Chief, let's make a run for it. The police are closing in and they have orders to kill. Now, we haven't a chance, neither of us, if we don't make a move now. Now please, come on. - It's annoying being hunted like this, isn't it, Dirk? But I escaped once before and I'll do it again. You ready, Irene? You're going with me. - Bill, don't let him. - I won't. - I've lost her. - That's it, chief. You've lost her, now face it. But there's still time for you and I. Now please, will you come, chief? Come on. - Do you know, Dirk, for the first time in my life, I'm tired. I'm really tired. I wish I could say bless you, my children, but I can't, because I'm going to kill you. - Don't be mad, chief. You mustn't have any more murders on your conscience. Let's make a break while we still got a chance. Now come on, chief, please. - Have I lost you too, Dirk? - If we don't go, they'll surely kill you now. - I'm not afraid to die. I don't want to live anymore. I've lost her, Dirk. Don't you understand? I've lost her. They won't be killing me when they shoot. I'm dead already. But before I go, out of my way, Dirk, or I'll kill you too. - Paul! - I'm sorry, chief. We had our chance. A slight chance. But you've lost it. I've lost. You better take her away from here, because when I kick that door open, there may be some firing, and it won't be safe for anybody. - It's out of your hands, Irene. It's out of everyone's hands.
