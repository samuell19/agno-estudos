Little girl, where did you come from? How did you get in my house? What are you doing here? (SCREAMS) (GASPS) (PHONE RINGING) AUTOMATED VOICE: You have reached the voicemail box of... Robert. (BEEPS) Yeah Robert, this is Pearson. These nightmares are back. I can't take this anymore, man. Call me as soon as you get this message. ROBERT: Yo, Pearson it's Robert. Come on in, Robert. Hey man, sorry to get you to come in on such a late notice. Hey, it's no problem. You know, I think I'm losing my friggin' mind. I hate to say this, but if he takes over your buildings you could lose everything. Why? I did everything he asked! Everything except the human sacrifice. You know what? Let's take a walk. Robert there's just no way I can be part of this human sacrifice, man. What have these innocent people done to deserve that type of pain? And the children. There's no way possible I can be part of the sacrificing of children. There's no way. You have to be prepared to lose everything, and I mean everything. What do I do? I mean, you made a deal with the devil. You got your riches. 'Cause you didn't understand what he wanted you're gonna lose everything. Yeah, but look I'm losing everything now. I mean, this warehouse is not even full of product anymore. I mean, it's going down to the drain now. What should I do? What should I expect next? Well, your products can be protected, your buildings can burn down, but if he sends demons down here it's gonna be very dangerous for everybody. Yeah, but I mean, I can't control people coming over here. There are people coming here day and night and I can't be here all the time to prevent them from coming in. ROBERT: Look, if the demons come it's gonna be very bad and very dangerous for everybody. I wouldn't let anybody in. Oh my goodness. I just can't deal with this any longer. There's no way I can do this. Maria, you seen Felipe? (SPEAKING FOREIGN LANGUAGE) Felipe! Felipe! Felipe! Felipe! Have you seen Felipe? Yeah, I saw him over there. FELIPE: Yes, sir? PEARSON: I need to talk to you for a minute. Hold on sir, hold on, gimme a sec. Where are all my workers? Uh, we are missing 10 workers, sir. - 10 workers? - Yes sir. How many showed up? Well there's five of us. There's me, there's Willie, and I got three girls in the back. You call those 10 people on the phone and tell them if they're not here tomorrow they're all fired. They're afraid sir. They claim there's noises in these warehouses. Noises? What kind of noises? It was several different noises. Strange laughs, crying babies, even crawling cats. (SPEAKING FOREIGN LANGUAGE) What the hell is going on? Where's Willie? Man, this place is crawling with evil. What are you talking about? I parked the forklift to move a few items and the machine attacked me. I went around some large crates but it went around them trying to get me. I've never prayed so hard in my life. I'm afraid to get near it now. - I saw the whole thing. - We're outta here. Felipe, what is going on here? What in the world is happening? I don't know man, it's over, it's over. It was a good run, but it's over. I can't believe this, I had a deal! And I've held up to my end. A deal? A deal with who? Oh don't worry about it, I'm just venting. Don't worry about it. What are you venting on, Mr. Pearson? No. (BIRDS CHIRPING) (DOORBELL RINGS) Yes? Hi, I'm looking for Mr. Pearson? That would be me. Sir, I'm here to pick up the car. It seems that you haven't made any payments for the past six months. I talked to the banker, he said take my time, he understood my situation and... I know sir, but that was four months ago. We haven't heard anything from you since. But my business is really down, I haven't sold anything for months... Sir, you know that's really not my problem but I'm sure you know people with money, maybe you could borrow some. Oh, I've tried to borrow it from all the banks, they turned me down. It's just not good right now. Well sir I'm really sorry but it's really not my problem so may I please have the car keys? (CRICKETS CHIRPING) (SUSPENSEFUL MUSIC) Damn I miss this place. MAN: Mr. Pearson. Who's there? Who is it? Funny seeing you here. PEARSON: I had to come back here, this place is my life. Yeah, whatever. But you sir are a persona non grata in these parts. Yes, but I built this place. This is something that I been... Correction. We built this place. For you. But you stopped your end of the deal and now you must go away before something bad happen to you. It's not fair, it's just not fair. No, no. What's not fair is the others who have to die for your mistakes. Those people are innocent! They've done nothing! You have failed to provide the agreed sacrifices so we come to collect from anyone who happens to be on our property. Mr. Pearson, this warehouse belongs to us. Anyone or anything in it belongs to us. They're innocent, it's just wrong! MAN: Leave or die! (DRAMATIC MUSIC) RAUL: Hey, hey who are you, what are you doing here? - Raul, don't you remember me? - What? Don't you remember me? - Oh hey, Mr. Pearson. - How you doing man? Good, I didn't recognize you, I'm sorry. How've you been? Oh that's okay, I'll tell you it's been a pretty bad day for me. The bank just took away the building and I've lost just about everything I have. I'm sorry to hear that sir. Just wanted to take a look at the old place one more time, you know, before it'd all get outta here, you know. Yeah, feel free. Just be careful, I don't wanna be responsible if anything happens to you here. - Here, I'll let you out. - Thank you. (DOORBELL RINGS) Yes? Hi, is Mr. Pearson available? That's me. Hi Mr. Pearson, I'm afraid I have some bad news for you today. We are going to have to repossess the home. Okay, let me get my stuff. (MELLOW ROCK MUSIC) (OMINOUS MUSIC) (SHOWER RUNNING) (HAUNTING MUSIC) (SCREAMS) Oh my god! Did I scare you? You did! Oh my god. - Oh my god! - What? - I'm glad you're here. - Okay. I have something to show you. Where did you find this? On the beach. I was walking back and you know I just saw it in the sand so I picked it up and brought it home. But you know what the weirdest thing was? What? When I walked in, all the cabinets were open. You mean all the kitchen cabinets were just open? Yeah. Like all of them? Yeah. All of them were open, every single drawer, everything. It was just wide open. Isn't that weird? Um, and okay you didn't put two to two together when you brought this board and when you saw the cabinets open? Well I mean it's just a game. I didn't make the connection. It's just a game. Okay, this is not just a game, okay? The Ouija board, it's... I mean, you invite spirits, (DRAMATIC MUSIC) evil spirits into your house. My sister played this game. Ever since she played that game we would hear like weird noises, knocks, screams, footsteps. I mean, after you play this game, you know things are not normal again. It's so far-fetched, I find it hard to believe. I still feel that it's just a game. I actually wanted to see if you wanted to try it. It can't do any harm. Well I'll try it, but you're gonna touch it first. I'm not. Okay. (SUSPENSEFUL MUSIC) Do you ask it a question? You wanna ask it? No. (LAUGHING) You ask it, ask any question you want. Okay. Um, let me see. Is anybody here? Ugh, you had to ask a question. - Are you moving it? - No. Don't lie, you're moving it. No, I wouldn't lie, you're the one who wanted to play this game. I'm barely touching it. You're moving it. I promise you, I promise you I am not moving it. You're just trying to scare me. I'm not. Oh my god, it's going to yes. Okay, okay. Okay look, let's just go to the beach. I don't wanna be here anymore, I don't wanna play this game anymore. Let's just go, please, please. - Okay. - Alright. Let me go put on my swimsuit. - Alright, hurry up. - Alright. (UPBEAT FUNKY MUSIC) (PHONE RINGING) Hey Bonnie, what's going on? The beach? No, I can't make it. No I have a hair salon appointment. Yeah, I'm going from blonde to brunette. Yeah the paranormal activity is still on. The meeting, tomorrow? Okay. Hey, I have a call coming in, let me call you back later. Have fun! Hey, big guy. Yeah, the meeting's still on. Charlie Charlie? No, I've never heard of it. Well you know me and the paranormal activity. Well, I'll try it. Okay. Sounds fun, I'll do it. Alright, I'll talk to you later, see you tomorrow. Bye. Charlie Charlie. Charlie Charlie, can you hear me? (DRAMATIC MUSIC) Charlie Charlie, are you here? Charlie Charlie, can you come out and play? Charlie Charlie, are you here? Charlie Charlie? Can you hear me? Charlie Charlie, can you come out and play? (SUSPENSEFUL MUSIC) Charlie you're no fun.

You know at first I didn't think you'd accept my invitation. Why, because I'm older or because I'm divorced? No, well yeah I mean I guess. It was very sweet of you to invite me to the movies. It was different. FRANKIE: Yeah I mean it was cool, wasn't it Miss Rivera? That's enough of that. Miss, don't call me Miss Rivera. Call me Rosie. After all, that is my name. Okay, sorry, jeez, it won't happen again, I promise. So how'd you like the movie? ROSIE: It was alright, but it lacked some action. FRANKIE: What do you mean? You know what I mean. That kind of action. I mean the main actor kicked some ass but I don't know what you mean by lacked some action. I tell you what. Find us a nice place somewhere in a very private area and I'll show you what I mean by real action. Now what were you saying about real action? Well why don't you get over here and I'll tell you what I mean by real action. You know Rosie, I'm about to live my greatest dream with the most beautiful girl in the universe. Am I a lucky son of a bitch or what? (TAPPING) Hey. I noticed you got here a few minutes ago and I know what you're up to. You can't stay here. Come on officer, just give us half an hour. We're just talking and sorting out some relationship problems. Ma'am are you here on your own free will or do you need any help? I'm okay, thank you, I'm fine. I'm with my boyfriend. He's telling the truth. We're sorting out some relationship problems. Thank you. Look, I'm not a cop so I won't give you the third degree but honestly I wouldn't stay here five minutes. This place gives me the creeps. ROSIE: What do you mean? Stay here long enough and you'll find out. Don't worry about us officer. I can handle myself pretty well. Now where were we? Well you were saying how much you wanted me, et cetera, et cetera. Oh yeah. Now why don't you take that shirt off? It looks really uncomfortable. Do I really have to? It's getting a little too cold out here. Don't worry, I'll keep you warm in no time. (GIGGLES) (CHILD LAUGHING) What the fuck? What the hell? - (SCREAMS) - Oh my god! Help me! (SCREAMING) Rosie! Rosie! I can't! (SHOUTING) (HAUNTING MUSIC) You know they never found Frankie and most investigators believe he's still out there for the murder of Rosie Sanchez. How does this qualify as a paranormal event? According to the security guard the warehouse was haunted. What makes him think so? He said he heard Frankie's voice from a distance until it completely faded away. Did Frankie say or ask anything? According to the security guard, Frankie said he needed to get out. Then this is why we're going into the warehouse, to investigate if anything paranormal's inside. Bingo. So like when do we go? I say we go today, 6 p.m. sharp. And be prepared to spend the night if anything. Can I wear shorts? Just wear anything that's comfortable to you. Okay, you said it. - Okay. - Alright. (SUSPENSEFUL MUSIC) (UPBEAT ROCK MUSIC) (SHOUTING) Oh my god this place is amazing. Hey hey hey hey! You scared me, idiots! Well where were you guys? We have been waiting for half an hour. Come on up here, come on over. I guess if I were a ghost this would be the kind of place I'd like to haunt. I don't think ghosts are the only things that would find this place enticing. What do you mean by that? I mean, if you really look at it I mean that any paranormal entity would like to hang around at a place like this. I mean it's cool, it's big, it's dark, and well, it's abandoned. So you guys agree there's a great chance to finding some spooks around here. Hell yeah. If not here then where? Well let's take a look at what we got here and then we can actually take a tour of the place before it gets too dark. Wait, have any of you really done any paranormal investigation before? Well, me. As a matter of fact this is my fourth time. This is a first for me and Melinda, but we're glad Mary Ann invited us. (LAUGHING) - That's true. - Well that's true. Me and Larry here spend an entire night at a cemetery searching for activity like a month ago. Was a very strange experience. How about you, Mary Ann? I'm a ghost magnet or something. I have so many paranormal experience it isn't even funny. MELINDA: What, are you serious? Yeah, my mom was into this whole Wicca thing, crazy stuff. It was like having front row seats into the paranormal world. - Wow. - Oh wow. Like how did it all affect you? It made me more interested. That's the real reason why I'm here. And that's why you're into this whole paranormal investigating stuff? I mean, if I'm gonna spend my whole life wondering about beyond, might as well understand it all. Makes perfect sense to me. (SUSPENSEFUL MUSIC) Let's hope we can find some answers to those questions here. Where do you guys want to start? Well, since this place is really huge I say we split up, take a look around before it gets too late. We'll meet here back again in an hour. And then we'll decide what to do from there. I'll go with Mary Ann to center to explore the area. Larry and Bonnie, you guys want to go to the left while Jimmy and Melinda go to the far right. Yeah, let's do it. BONNIE: What if we run into something bad? Don't panic. Take a video, take a picture and we'll analyze it together when we get back. - Let's go. - Let's do it. I just really do hope we don't hear Frankie's voice pleading for help. He better not call out 'cause I'm not gonna answer and I don't wanna talk about Frankie anymore. Might wanna get your camera ready. Why? What happened? This place looks like a good place for a ghost or whatever to hide out. Is that a doll up there? I think so. What is a doll doing inside of a warehouse? BONNIE: I don't know. I mean this place has been abandoned for years. It's so strange. Wow. This is awesome. So spacious. I wonder what it was used for. MELINDA: As storage maybe? It's just so odd. Why? Why would you say that? Well if it was used for storage well why aren't there any boxes or anything like that here? (SUSPENSEFUL MUSIC) Uh 'cause maybe they were just put away? Or... (DRAMATIC MUSIC) Jimmy, what was it, what did you see? Jimmy what are you doing? JIMMY: Just do that. Why are you filming the stupid rat for? Look. There's another room over there. MARY ANN: This place is so scary and abandoned. I know, the smell is awful. It's horrible. Yeah. I wonder what's in those boxes? Well there's only one way to find out. Nothing here, it's empty. - This doesn't feel right. - What? So many empty containers. This isn't a storage warehouse. But I do wanna take some pictures. This place is so eerie in its own way. (SCREAMS) Next time you do that I'm gonna punch you fast! Oh really? - And hard! - Oh. Where did you get that? Right there, it was in the box. I wonder how it got up there? Well it's a doll. Dolls like to play, you know. She was probably playing hide and seek. This place is so creepy. I'm so ready to go with the others. Let's go. Let's go. Fred, the doll's gone. FRED: Where is it? I'm being serious Fred, the doll's gone. No I'm serious too, I don't know where it is. Come on, let's just go with the others. Let's get out of here. Hey. Look at that. Is that a mannequin? Might be someone's toy. Maybe we should leave it alone. (SCREAMS) It's creepy. It's a mannequin. Come on. BONNIE: Let me take a picture. (CAMERA CLICKS) Man that doll is creepy. (SUSPENSEFUL MUSIC) Larry. Let's go back. I thought you said you weren't scared. Let's just, come on, let's go back. (CAMERA CLICKS) I wonder what this place was used for. Look Jimmy they have a table that's all dusty and doesn't even belong here. I have no idea what this room was used for. Jimmy, I don't think they used this place. You know, this is probably just a place where they keep an eye on the workers, right? So strange. Look, it only gets to the number 13. Isn't that weird? (DRAMATIC MUSIC) - What's wrong, Jimmy? - I'm fine, I'm fine. Is that smoke or is it fog? I don't know, I don't know! Just take a picture and let's get the fuck outta here. Okay! Get the fricking camera open, hold on! Okay I'm going, what to see! Okay I got it, I got it. We were about to leave when all of a sudden we saw fog come out of nowhere. It's true you guys, we were there and it was clear as day but then I turned around and I saw some fog, we saw some fog and we just got only a few pictures of it. There's some strange things happening here. We encountered our first spooky with the doll. Wait what do you mean with a doll? - We saw one too. - You did? Yeah. Can I see the pictures? MARY ANN: Yeah, we took some pictures and when we looked back it was gone. Oh my god there's something there in the fog! - What is that? - That's right. What? That wasn't there when we took the picture. Oh shit, this is weird. Oh my god I have no idea, I have no idea. Did you see anything strange when we took our pictures? The mannequin's gone. We took pictures, he was there. We went back, he wasn't there anymore. And you're just telling me this now? Wait, you didn't hear anything? It couldn't have just gotten up and left. I thought I did, but guys I don't know, I'm really freaked out. Well we saw a doll too and it was gone when we turned back. Yeah, yeah that's right. So did it move or someone take it? FREDDY: No. MARY ANN: It was only just us two. Damn, these are too strange to be coincidences. There's something definitely here and we have to decide whether we want to spend the night here and get to the bottom of this. - Or what? - Or, you guys, we could always think about it or come tomorrow? Think about what, no. I say we stay here and we solve the mystery of the devil's warehouse. Wait. You guys, let's settle this. Are we gonna stay here? Yeah. If you guys wanna leave it's okay, no one would judge your decision. - I'm not leaving here. - I'll stay. I mean yeah me too. I'm not saying that we spend the night here, I'm just saying that we consider all of Bonnie's choices before we do anything rash. I mean there is a killer mannequin running around. What exactly lies in store for us if we stay? I mean I don't know but if it's what I think it is, it'll be like a long night in hell. Don't say that, you're scaring me. Don't you ever say that. So are we staying? - Yes, I'm staying with you. - Are you sure? Yes, of course. Let's do this then, let's stay. Okay, go to it. (CLATTERING) (GASPING) What was that? (SUSPENSEFUL MUSIC) (DISTORTED CHILD VOICES) Did you guys hear that? Yeah, what is it? I think it's coming from over there. Mary Ann's right. Let's go check it out. Hello? Anybody there? Hello? Let me just... Hello? Guys, I think we need to regroup. Guys he's right, we need to regroup and rethink what the hell we're getting ourselves into. I agree. What do you think, Freddy? - Yeah, yeah let's go. - Let's do it. Alright let's get out of here but stay focused guys. Let's do it, let's get out of here. I just can't believe I heard what I heard. I wonder what that came from. Oh my god guys this is my first paranormal encounter, I'm so excited. What? What the hell's the matter with you? You guys, come on. We just walked in the middle of the darkness and we just heard some little child's voice, what the hell? Hold on Melinda. But aren't we here to find any kind of strange activity? I mean hearing a child's voice would qualify as strange. - Yeah. - Or paranormal if you prefer. Yes, but you guys I mean come on. I mean we heard the voices. I mean it doesn't happen you're like every day occurrences you know. - It's just creepy. - It is. That's the whole point of the adventure, to find and record a paranormal of this place. The creepier the better guys. Agree? What did I get myself into? We wanted strange, creepy, terrifying. Then what better place than here, the devil's warehouse? (SUSPENSEFUL MUSIC) Hey, what the hell is that? (BABY CRYING) I think it's just a cat's howl. MELINDA: Well something or someone scared it away. Question is who, what? Aren't we supposed to be here alone? Yeah, that's the point. I'm just gonna go and check it out. Wait what are you doing? You don't know what you'll find. I agree. Yeah but someone's gonna have to look into it. Isn't that the reason why we're here for? Yeah. Let's just go. Alright, I'm going with Freddy you guys. (OMINOUS MUSIC) FREDDY: Couldn't be a cat, could it? MELINDA: No, no I don't think so. - Right? - No, no. Can't believe you volunteered to come look with me. I know, but if I didn't, I wouldn't be able to conquer my fear. That's right. Gotta tell you you actually picked a very spooky place to start conquer your fears. Well if I don't do it now, when will I? What's that place? A room? I think so. Should we just go and check it out? I guess. What is this? It's pretty spooky in here Freddy. Yeah it is. And the smell is unbearable. (DOOR SLAMS) What the hell? - Hey. - Freddy open the door! (BANGING) Freddy come on, stop playing around, this is not a joke, open the door! I'm not playing around, I swear! MELINDA: Freddy come on, don't do this! It closed by itself! Freddy come on, please open the door for god's sake! - Come on Freddy, open the door! - I'll go get some help! Hurry up Freddy please! (CHILD LAUGHING) Oh my god. (HAUNTING MUSIC) Oh my god. (CHILDREN LAUGHING) (CRYING) What do you want from me? Please leave me alone! (CHILDREN LAUGHING) (SCREAMING) - She's locked inside! - Where? I've been trying to open the door but I can't! I don't know what's happened! Melinda, Melinda! What the hell happened here, where's Melinda? Okay so we came here together, right? She walked inside the room and the door closed behind her. I know it sounds crazy but I tried to open it but it's impossible! (DOOR CREAKS) Melinda? Melinda? What the hell is this? Whose blood is this? Where's Melinda? I don't know. What do you mean you don't know? Exactly, that makes absolutely no sense. She was here with you. Well yeah she was here, but I don't know. Hey, what are you saying? Don't even go there, I'm telling you the truth guys! What are you suggesting, huh? Huh? Nobody's accusing you of anything, Freddy. But this all seems a little too strange. Way too damn strange. Are you telling me that Melinda was here one second and then she just magically disappeared? Yes. - She left or she just left... - She just... And now there's a puddle of blood here? I don't have any logical explanation, okay? Well you're gonna have to do better than that. No listen, she was here and she was fine. (CLATTERING) - Eh? - Quiet guys. Quiet quiet quiet quiet. Somebody's out there. (HAUNTING MUSIC) Melinda? Is that you? Melinda? Is that you? Whoever or whatever is out there, it's not Melinda. She would have answered if it were her. Yeah but I still have to go find her. Where are you going? I'm gonna go find Melinda. If it were me, I would want someone to go find me. Wouldn't you? Did you not see that room? All the blood? At least take Jimmy with you. Why don't you come with me too? Let's go, come on, let's go. Guys, please stay here, it's better if you guys just stay. Trust me, trust me okay? - We're just supposed to wait? - What is he talking about? Melinda! Melinda! Where are you? Hate to break it to you Mary Ann but Melinda's gone, okay? You saw how the room looked. - No. - Freddy had to have done something to her, he was the only one there. No no no no, she has to be okay. You can't just blame him for doing something wrong. Yeah. I'm sure there's a good explanation to her disappearance. Listen I know it's hard to believe but I tried to open the door in every possible way. It wouldn't open. - You have to admit... - I just couldn't do it. It opened and closed very easily. I know I saw it. It's almost as if we were set up. Set up by who, why? (SUSPENSEFUL MUSIC) Set up by whomever or whatever haunts this place. They knew we were here. They knew we were coming to this place. So when she walked inside they closed the door. It was a trap. You really think so? How could you explain all this? What was that? There's a presence here with us. Don't be afraid, it's trying to scare us. Whoever you are, we're not afraid of you! Listen, stop antagonizing it. Just stop. (CLATTERS) Stop antagonizing it. Is that the best you can do? Show me something really scary! Just be quiet, Bonnie. It doesn't play by the same rules we do. What the fuck? (SPEAKS INDISTINCTLY) Remember the pictures? There was something weird, just don't get close. Get away from it. (SHOUTING) Freddy, what's wrong? I can't even move! - What do you mean? - I can't move! What do you mean you can't move? - I can't move! - What do you mean? Help me, somebody help me! (SHOUTING) BONNIE: Leave us alone, leave us alone! (SCREAMING) Oh my god, what is that? (INTENSE MUSIC) Let's see how close we can get to it. Whoa, where'd it go? MARY ANN: Where'd it go? Let's just get out of here, guys. Let's go. Fred, Fred? Snap out of it. Where's Bonnie? Hey. (SNAPPING) She asked you a question, where is she? She's gone. What? Well no shit Sherlock, the question is where did she go? The fog took her. What are you talking about? This thick fog came here and something invisible came out of it and drag her into it and then they just disappear, she's gone. So why didn't it take you too? Well I don't know Larry, I've no idea! Probably 'cause he just wanted her! Alright guys, this is bullshit. First Melinda gets lost, now Bonnie, both on your watch? Back off, Larry. I'm not gonna back off dude, this is way too intense. You're seeing all the stuff that's going on bro. Stop! This is way too crazy for me. Stop, stop! They have to be out there. We have to go find them. No you can't go find them. They are gone! They are not here! Well you seem pretty sure at that, don't you? Enough of that Larry. Fighting amongst ourselves we're not gonna get anything done. You sound like a bunch of crybabies. (SCREAMING) What was that? It should be a doll. It's the same doll we saw at the boxes, remember? We have to go look for it. No, we can't do that. - Come on, let's go. - No, we can't. We don't know what she's up to. We don't know what you're up to half the time. Hey listen just shut your mouth. Come at me bro! Come at me, come at me! You're not gonna do anything! Listen I didn't do anything to them! - I didn't do anything! - Just calm down! They were taken away! Alright, there is absolutely nothing here. No physical proof that anything happened to them except you, you're the missing link. What happened to them? Well I can't give you explanation! - I don't know! - What about the blood! I don't know what happened! We came here to investigate the unnatural. You forgot? Freaking idiot, you can't just see it. This place is crawling with demons and creatures. I don't even know if we're gonna make it out of here alive. What are you saying? Do you really believe that? Of course I do, I didn't do anything to them. Alright you guys, you know what? I don't have to sit here listening to your bullshit okay? I'm gonna go out there, find some real paranormal activity 'cause I'm not sitting here listening with this fucker, alright? Wait, wait, wait, wait. You really think Freddy's capable of hurting those girls? I don't know what he's capable of, honestly. Then why would you accuse him of murder? You know if he's really doing these things we ought to call this investigation off. And call the police. Maybe it's just the pressure getting to me. Or maybe it's Freddy, I don't know what it is. You know I just really do hope that the girls are just playing a joke on us. Yeah, I agree. But we ought to find this doll and find the girls wherever they are. LARRY: Just I know there's a connection between the doll and the girls, I just don't know what it is. Yeah, I agree. (SUSPENSEFUL MUSIC) Hello? Is anybody here? The door's open. Hello? Hello? Goddamn wind. Hey. Are you a security guard? What are you guys doing in here? Did you bust the lock on that door? You know you're trespassing, this is private property. You shouldn't be here. Yeah. I'm Mary Ann. This is Larry, one of my partners. We're paranormal investigators. One of your partners? - Yeah. - How many of you are there? We're six in total but two are currently missing. What do you mean missing? She doesn't necessarily mean missing, more like there's two girls just running around the warehouse trying to play tricks on us. Yeah so we're just checking out, just for paranormal activity. Something just shut the door when I came in here. (SUSPENSEFUL MUSIC) Did you get to see it? I think it was the wind but there was a doll right there. There's no way that doll could have moved by itself. You'd be surprised, sir, honestly. - Yeah. - It was there? Welcome to the devil's warehouse. Where evil comes to play. Bonnie! Bonnie! Bonnie's not here, I told you. You were not paying attention to me. That thing in the fog dragged her away. It's not gonna let her go. We can't just give up like that. FREDDY: Come on man. We can't leave without Bonnie, man! Bonnie is not in this place anymore, I told you, listen! She's gone, she's gone, she's not here. You get it? Hey Jimmy, where are you going, I'm talking to you man! Hey. What? What the? Hey. Where are you going, Jimmy, Jimmy come here. Hey Jimmy, Jimmy stop! Who are you? What are you doing here? I'm looking for my dolls, they walked away. Stop talking to her, stop talking to her, come back! JIMMY: And why did they walk away? I just need to find my dolls. Jimmy, Jimmy stop. Jimmy, Jimmy, Jimmy, Jimmy just come back here. Forget about your dolls, just come here with me and we'll take you home and we'll look for your dolls later, okay? Listen stop talking to her, don't get closer to her. Just come back Jimmy! Stop being so fricking paranoid, she's just a child. No she's not a child. Have you forgotten everything that happened? Just come back here! GIRL: Please help, can you help me find my dolls? Look, just come here with us and I promise you I'll look for your dolls later, just come here with us. Jimmy please don't do this. Just come back here, Jimmy. Come on honey. Just come here. - Jimmy... - I want my damn dolls. Jimmy, Jimmy, Jimmy. (OMINOUS MUSIC) Did you hear that? Yeah, I need to go investigate. Wait, we'll go with you, come on. What happened? Is he okay? No, Mary Ann. He's not okay. He's dead. Had to go and kill Jimmy too? Oh, come on. LARRY: Dude, you're a murderer. How did this happen? He was fine just a little while ago. Let me look. Yeah he's dead, alright. Looks like he hit his head and it killed him. Wait, you're saying he hit his head and died because of it? Yes. Well that doesn't mean he wasn't pushed. Come on, would you just stop trying to blame me for every single thing that happens here? Calm down, accidents happen. I know that! Will you explain that to him? No matter how he died, this is a crime scene now, there's a dead body here. We gotta go to the front door and call the cops, let's go. - (SUSPENSEFUL MUSIC) - Let's go. Wait, wait! You see it? You see that fog? It's the same fog that dragged Bonnie away. What do you think it wants? FREDDY: No idea, just stay away from it, stay away, Larry. Guys are you seeing this right now? The body's being dragged into the, we gotta go, we gotta go. I'm not staying here for this, come on, let's go. - We gotta go. - Am I the only one who's seeing this? It's dragging his body off into the fog! We gotta go, we gotta get outta here guys, this isn't right. God maybe this place really is haunted. I've been trying to explain that to you from the very beginning! MARY ANN: We gotta go, guys, we gotta go now. Yeah good luck trying to accomplish that, guys. Don't you see it? Whatever haunts this place doesn't want us out of here. (CHOKING) Guys? Larry... Larry? Larry? Larry? Fuck. Fuck fuck. I can't believe what just happened. I think he's dead. - Hey! - Where's Larry? Larry's gone. He faded into the fog. We gotta get outta here, we gotta get some help. Alright, alright calm down, we're gonna go out the front door, front door's right there, let's go. It's right here? (SUSPENSEFUL MUSIC) Oh my god! He's still out there. We need to find another way out. Listen there is no other way out of here, okay? It's my job to make sure these doors are locked, they're all locked, there's no other way to get out of here but the front door. What are you saying, that we're screwed? Yeah, we're totally screwed unless we can go out the front door. We have to keep moving. Let's just stay away from it. Alright, alright let's go. MARY ANN: Do you think we'll find Miranda and Bonnie? FREDDY: To be honest with you, I don't think so. (SPEAKS INDISTINCTLY) I doubt they are alive. How did this go all wrong? It's supposed to be a haunted warehouse, not a death trap. Wait, you didn't see all the locks on the doors and the signs that say keep out? Yeah but every other warehouse has the same sign. What part of keep out don't you understand? Come on man, you know she's not talking about that kind of sign. She's talking about something warning people that this place is real dangerous. Look man, keep out is keep out! Okay, okay let me ask you something. Did you know about all this? All this weird things happening here? Well I'd heard some of the stories. Oh! Yeah but I sure as hell wasn't gonna come in here and see if they were true at night! Wait wait wait, what kind of stories? - Bodies disappearing... - Oh! Blood and guts, people dying. - Oh, bodies, disappearing. - Yeah, yeah. What else? Well. Over the course of a few years a bunch of night guards quit. Couple others just disappeared. At first they thought they quit too but they never came to get their checks so. FREDDY: And nobody ever got suspicious, right? Yeah, a bunch of people did. There was this one manager, he thought it was all BS so he decided I'm gonna spend the night in there. So they came and opened the place in the morning. Blood splattered everywhere, nobody ever found the body. Wait, is that why all the workers quit? Yeah yeah everybody got real scary after that. They just walked off the job. This place was closed in a matter of weeks, that's what happened. Wait why didn't the media report any of this? What's the media gonna report, it was all speculation! Ghosts terrorize warehouse? And if they had reported it it wouldn't have - made a difference anyway. - Oh really? GUARD: Yeah it wouldn't have made any difference. FREDDY: Why, why do you say that? Okay, so you see the articles, you watch it on TV. Would that have kept you from coming in here? - Well... - Huh? Actually it would have made me more curious. Yeah, exactly, exactly. You're more curious. Yeah, but you know what they say. Curiosity killed the cat. Ah, cat. Yeah, and guess what, meow we are the cat. Yes but we're not dead. Not today. Yeah and if we wanna stay alive all we gotta do is beat these entities that are out there. Sounds easy right? But guess what this thing is watching us. It's watching every single move. (DRAMATIC MUSIC) Do you hear that? Yeah, they know where we're at. What do you want? What do you think they want, what are we gonna do? Listen listen calm down. All we have to do is survive the night, okay? It's that simple. It's simple! (SHOUTING) Listen to me, listen to me! Nothing bad has ever happened here in the daylight. Everything that's gone wrong happened at night. If we watch the sun come up, we survive. We're it right now! Wait wait wait. If what you're saying is true all we gotta do is stay alive for a couple more hours. Yeah, that's it. - It's almost daylight! - That's it. All we gotta do is stay away from danger. Yeah, sure, no problem. (SUSPENSEFUL MUSIC) That's it, we're good. Wait 'til daylight. - Hey man, what are you doing? - Freddy? Where are you going, man? You know what, this crowd too, my friends away. Took Jimmy and Melinda, I'm tired of this crap. We have to stick together! Come back, it's almost daylight! We'll be okay! - Are you with me or not? - We'll be okay. - Freddy! - Look out! Watch out Freddy! (SHOUTING) - We gotta get out of here. - Come on let's go, let's go! (INTENSE MUSIC) Oh my god, oh my god, oh my god. Shh, quiet. Yeah I'm scared too alright. Just calm down. - We're gonna be okay. - What are we gonna do? I don't know, I don't know, just let me think for a second okay? I gotta think. You think they'll find us? Yeah, I think if we stay here long enough. They know this place way better than we do. Who knew these dolls were gonna be so malicious? I didn't know that. So what you're telling me is that you came here and you did no research at all. What kind of investigator are you? Obviously not a very smart one. Well. After we came here all those guards quit I did some research. This warehouse has been haunted for a long time. What are you saying? Well, the guy who owned this place was head of a group that kind of fancied themselves like the Illuminati or something. Wait I've never heard that before. Well, this group of seven, what they did they made a pact with the devil. The deal was they had to sacrifice one child a month and then they would become rich beyond their wildest dreams. And they did that? Yeah, as legend has it they all became billionaires. It went on for a long time. Then they just couldn't stomach the killing anymore. It just stopped. Bunch of them killed themselves, they all went crazy. The devil got the last laugh on that one. If what you're saying is true then there are other haunted warehouses, right? Yeah, hell yeah. But for some reason this place, this warehouse right here is the epicenter of it all. Wait but those dolls, they look so innocent. No, they're not dolls! That's the devil himself okay! You can't look at him in dolls, they'll do anything they can to make you drop your guard and kill you! (DRAMATIC MUSIC) Oh my god, there's someone out there. Shh, I don't think they hear us, they can't see us. - How do you know? - I don't know! I'm just saying. We gotta get outta here. No no, we need to stay put, it's almost daylight, okay? If we just stay here 'til daylight what happens if we get all the way to the front door and it's still dark? We're gonna die. We have to stay here. It's 6 a.m. We can make it, it's almost daylight. Come on, let's make a break for it. Come on. Alright listen, here's what we're gonna do. I'm gonna open that door, we're gonna make a beeline for the front door. Don't stop for anything, okay? - Let's do it. - Are you ready? Yeah yeah yeah, let's do it. - Alright you ready? - Yeah, ready. One, two, three. (EXCITING MUSIC) (BIRDS CHIRPING) Oh my god, it's that doll. Think I'm afraid of some damn doll? Don't get near, no! No! (SCREAMING) (BANGING) (SCREAMING) Are you okay miss? Miss, miss? Are you okay? Let's get outta here, come on. Let's go. Come on. (DOOR SLAMS) No! (HAUNTING MUSIC) Subtitles by explosiveskull (DRAMATIC MUSIC)
