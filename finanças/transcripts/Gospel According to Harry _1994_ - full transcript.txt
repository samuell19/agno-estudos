[MUSIC PLAYING] [THUMP] -Karen. Karen. OK, fine. You don't want to talk? Tell me I'm an idiot. Say, Wes, do this, do that. Vacuum the carpet. Wash the dishes. -Enough. [MUSIC PLAYING] -I love you, Karen. I wish you'd just try to understand. Just try. There's no point in having any. What for? There's nothing left. There's nothing. -Mom, hi. I'm fine. I'm OK. It's awful. So many years now. He's afraid to make me pregnant. You know how stubborn he is. I can't take it anymore. OK. I love you, too. [MUSIC PLAYING] -I told you, dear. With a fast one. You're the one who is rushing to the alter as if he's the only fish in the pond. Look at Jim Sadler and the way he treats his wife. Bought her a peach color convertible which matches her hair. She looks gorgeous in it. Children are adorable. He was so much in love with you. Why? No. He's too tall for you. You like his voice, remember? Well, now you're paying for it. Make the same mistake that I did. And then she'll think carefully before she commits herself. Uh. Your father nearly killed me before he died. I'm a different woman now-- so relieved, so happy. It's hard to be alone, I know. It's lucky to take care of yourself when feeding, nursing, and protecting a monster. I didn't deserve it, and I'm not going to let the same thing happen to you. A man should be a man and respect his woman. You can't live without respect. And, dear, it's about time. [MUSIC PLAYING] -Karen! [MUSIC PLAYING] -I'm sorry!

I thought you'd tell us the score. -(ON TV) And we're at the bottom of the fourth. -All right, bottom of the fourth, guys. -(ON TV) You can see the action here is really heating up in the ballpark. Pitcher's coming in. He's checking over his shoulder, looking at second. The throw, it's a line drive, and no, it's gone foul down the third base line. -He needs a big fly to the left. -Nah, to the right. -Right. -Karoom. -(ON TV) Than any other player on the team this year. He's going to take the pitch again and-- ooh. Gosh, looks like he got him on the hip. I'm not sure. -Hey, Wes, you got any beer? -Yeah. -That's all right. I'll get it. It's self-service, right -Help yourself. -Hey, Wes, you ain't got no beer. -No? I thought I did. Sorry. -Hey, we need a homer now, man. -You don't even have a coke. -What's this?

[SLURP] No fat soup, looks like it. -How come you got married? -Well, I guess I was young, you know. -Guys, what's up? -Well, we were just discussing your diet. -Yeah, your diet. Is that what she makes you eat? -You guys got something better to talk about? -You allow that, man? -You guys want to watch the game or what? -The game sucks. Your ice box is better. [LAUGHTER] -I don't need your company. -I told you. -You didn't have to tell me. -OK Buddy, we're leaving, and you won't so us in your rotten place again. -Good. -Unless you get some beer. -Why don't you bring your own beer next time, you little prick? -Did you hear that? -Yup. -He offended me, right? -He damn sure did. -You're the witness, right? -Right. -Oh come on. -I'll kill him in a fight. -Get out of here man. It's nothing worth a shit. Let's go. -(SINGING) I've got the sand. I've got the sand all in my head. I've got the sand. I've got the sand all in my bed. I've got so much trouble in my life, sand coming through my heart, in black of night.

[MUSIC PLAYING] [SCREAMS] -I want to go We're going to be killed! -I don't care. Just hold me. -Who is that, Wes? Bernie? -No, it's Jameson and Tully of Jameson, Tully and Bambridge. -Tully came back? -I guess so. -He wasn't supposed to be back. -Well, he is. -That's strange. -Yup. -Look, Wes, they're fighting. Look! -They always fight. -You should stop them. -Why? -Because you should. -Do you think they're fighting because of the stock market? -Could be. -OK. You wash up. I'll exercise. Got to burn the calories. -Making love burns the calories. -Not really. None of the muscles get used. -Yeah, I noticed. -(ON TV) Give me two more. I want you to roll over onto your elbows and knees. Let's concentrate more on the buttocks and the back of the thigh. Place your elbows directly underneath your shoulders, hold abs in tight, lifting and lowering. Press through that heel. Press up to the ceiling, making sure you're working it down also. Work the movement down and up. Relax the shoulders, keeping the head straight and relaxed. Up, down, you've got great legs, great strong legs. Abdominals are tight, head's relaxed, working that move. OK, how about a little smaller range of motion? Press it up, up, up. [DISHES CLANGING] -Hi. -Hi. What are you doing? -Taking care of some business. Nothing much. And you? -I was just exercising. -[LAUGHING] I see. How are you? -Ah, I'm fine. How are you? -I'm fine as well. -But he isn't fine. -Oh, you think so? -Yeah, he doesn't look so good. JAMESON: It depends. KAREN: On what? JAMESON: The circumstances. -What do you have in mind? -The weather, for example. Do you think it's going to rain? -I don't think so. It hasn't rained for years. -It's not good for the greenery. -There's no greenery. There's only sand. -I know, but still, it's not good. It's going to be a beautiful day, don't you think? -I have to go. -I see. OK. -Bye. -Keep well. -Argh. -Give my regards to Wes. KAREN: I will. -Wes? -Yes, Love? -That was so weird. -What's that? -I went out to see Jameson. He was so weird. By the way, he sends his regards. -Make a pass at you? No. Nothing like that. it was different. He was so weird. He acted as if nothing happened. -Did anything happen? -Of course. -He just killed Tully. -So what? I don't care if he killed him. I don't care if they all kill themselves! What I care about is you. -[CRYING] You don't believe me. You never believe me. I was telling the truth. -I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I lost my head. I'm sorry. Please. Don't cry. It's me. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. [INAUDIBLE] I love you so much. [MUSIC PLAYING] -It's amazing. Liz Taylor lost 20 pounds in just a month. She looks beautiful. I -Gorgeous. -It's so important to keep the right diet. -My girlfriend is doing carbohydrates. -Oh yeah? -Yeah. The Dr. Zimmer Diet. -I don't know that one. -You only eat vegetables, bread, macaroni, and nothing else. -The macaroni's kind of heavy. I like beans and rice, and mix those, make a complete protein. -I think it's best to choose one diet and stick with it. -I agree. How much did your friend lose? -She didn't lose anything yet. I think she cheats. -That's awful. -I know! Horrible! She sneaks out and has a huge piece of cream cake or something. I think she gained. -How much? Five pounds at least. [MUSIC PLAYING] -Good morning. Harry White, IRS.

You sure? -Yeah, mine. -You sure you didn't make any mistakes? -I don't think so. You think so. -What I think is what I think. Would you please kneel, and kiss my briefcase? Do you swear to tell the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth? -So help me God. -OK. -Were there any changes determining quality to these costs, valuations between opening and closing inventory? -Yeah, Section GH, I checked yes. -I know that. What about depreciation, Section 179, deductions from Form 4562? -That's not included in Section Three. -That's correct. -Did you enter line 31 end of line five? -I don't know. Did I? -Are you asking me? -Can I-- let me see. -Absolutely not! -I got so fed up with him. Uh. Really tired. He never understood me, never even tried to. Right after the wedding, I wanted to go to Disneyland, have some fun, see Mickey Mouse, be like a kid, you know? -Mm-hmm. I love Minnie Mouse. -Minnie's just great. -Oh, so he says, no. We've got to be alone, walk on the beach, so we went to this motel near San Diego, and it was so horrible. Horrible! It was the year when the Pacific dried up. Do you remember? -How could I forget? -And the mosquitoes had a feast. Sam only wanted to see me naked, and make love to me. I wanted it, too. Don't get me wrong. I was attracted to him, but not all the time. It was so boring after a while. Since I met Jeff, mm, my whole life became a dream, fantastic. Oh God, I'm so much in love now. It's so good to have a lover. When I get close to him, my skin is like electrified. It lights up. -How do you manage? Do you still sleep with your husband? -I have to. I'm his wife. -Doesn't your body feel repulsed? I mean, doesn't it just refuse to? -I close my eyes and think of Jeff, and how wonderfully better he is, and I begin to love him even more. -Hello. [MUSIC PLAYING] On the way here, when I was looking into the distance, I saw all these people, good citizens, laboring and resting, struggling and enjoying themselves under the ruins of houses and offices, homes and factories, I saw them all, and I had one thought, just one thought. Let's bring us together. Let's labor and rest. -Get out of here. -No, I want to finish my speech. Let's labor and rest, struggle and enjoy ourselves, in gentler, kinder way. Let's create, yes, let's unite and create a better nation. Let's forget the past, and heal our wounds. Let's just look into the future. There's a light, a tender ray, a beam of hope for better days, for the satisfying future of all of us. To illustrate my point, I want to show your something, something very dear to my heart, an example of what I just said. -Now with the sand, when it gets inside, what do you do? -I am trying not to think about it. -I try, too, but it hurts. It hurts so bad. -Not so much with a new lover. -This is my boot. I just took it from my foot. It's good leather. It's good made. It fits me perfectly. Do you think it's an American make? No, you're wrong. This boot is made in China. It was give to me while I was there, and it proves we all, we, the people of this planet, can make and have the same things, the same goals. Thank you. -You know why they call a manila envelope manila? -No, Harry, I'm afraid I don't. -Don't be afraid, Wes, either do I.

Mm. -Do you think they need a victim? -Victim? A hero. What was I saying? I don't like eating here because the sand gets in my teeth. -(LAUGHING) I don't agree. It helps to keep them clean. [MUSIC PLAYING] -How does it feel? [MUSIC PLAYING] Why'd you attack the president? [MUSIC PLAYING] Can't you talk? [MUSIC PLAYING] It's OK. I can.
