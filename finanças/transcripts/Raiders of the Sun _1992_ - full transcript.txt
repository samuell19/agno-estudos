(dramatic, ominous electronic music) - [Narrator] After the final nuclear war, radiation devastated the land. Few survived. Those who did survive, desperate for food and protection formed gangs to scavenge and fend for themselves. One group, craving a return to law and order created the Alpha League, a democratic society. It wasn't long before the League was attacked by outsiders. But the most devastating assault came from traitors within the League's own ranks. (ominous music) - Fire. - Come on! Come on! - Fire! (explosions banging) - Pull back. - Major, over there, we have to capture that arsenal. - Baker 12, unit Baker 12 come in. - Talbot here. - Arsenal at 10 o'clock. Secure at all costs. - Yes sir. Let's go! (machine guns cracking) - Harry, blow the arsenal! - But we need the gunpowder. - If I can't have it, Shelton can't have it. I said, blow it now. - But it's our own men guarding it. Ackerman. - Yo. - Blow the arsenal. - Blow the arsenal. - Hey! - Get the bazooka. Blow the fuckin' arsenal. - We're running out of ammunition. - Pull back! Pull back! (soldiers yelling) - Deserters are in full retreat Commander. - Anything on Clay? - We didn't have a fix on him. - Get me Brodie. - Captain Brodie, it's Commander Shelton. - Sir. - Listen Brodie, find Clay. I want to make an example out of that traitorous bastard. I must have him alive. - To the ruins. - Come on. Move out. - Guns down! You shouldn't have turned on us Clay. - Get him! Get him! - Hold it! Come on guys. Come on. Let's go. (trumpet blaring) (cheering) - We did it, we did it! - Colonel Clay's escaped Commander. We don't know where he is. - Captain. - Yes, Talbot. - My hitch was up about six months ago and since the League has come out of this on top, I'd like your permission to head home. - Where you from Sergeant? - Pagosa Valley. - Tell you the truth, I wish you'd stay. You're the best I've got and I need guys like you. - I've got a wife back home sir. - Well, I guess I can't compete with that can I? - No sir! - Good luck Talbot. - Thank you sir, thank you. (men yelling) - What are the damages? - Oh around 300 casualties, another 250 injured. - Terminate the serious ones. We can't afford to drag them along. What about materials? - Now way getting around it, we're in bad shape. See for yourself. - How long before we're up and running? - Not that long. Gunpowder's our biggest problem. - Then we'll find some more. It's the difference between winning and losing. If we hadn't been running low on ammunition we would have broken their asses. I won't accept this defeat. I don't accept it. - Good stuff, where'd you find it? - Been saving it. What are the goats for? There's some nice girls around here Talbot, all you got to do is ask. - I'm taking them home to my wife. - Didn't know you were married. - Yeah. - Does this mean you're out of the military? - First thing in the morning, I'm finished with it. - Yeah, but is it finished with you? - Brodie, there's something I want you to do. It's urgent and it requires secrecy. - Gunpowder! - We've got to replenish our supply. - Won't be easy, I mean stuff is scarce. - I've just received a field report from Ballentine. You know the place? - Know the place, it's a fuckin' hellhole, I've been there. - A couple of our recruiters just got back, said they heard word about a lost mine. Some kind of black powder. If this is true, we have to get our hands on it before Clay does. - On my way. - Rider! Rider coming! - Who's in charge here? - Vera! - That's me, I'm head of the village council. - Thought maybe you had some trouble out here. We've been trying to raise you for the last three days. - Yeah, our radio's out. Thanks for checking on us. - I guess that means you folks haven't heard. There was a big face-off at Breakdown Canyon. The insurrection is busted. (cheering) - Are you saying it's over? - Just got some mopping up to do. - Did you hear that Pops? - I heard and I'll believe it when I see it. - Aah Pops! - I know you want to see Talbot, just don't want you to get your hopes up. I've been through this too many times. - How come you're always a skeptic huh? - Cause I love you, that's how come. - Maybe he'll be coming home soon. - Maybe he will. - How about some breakfast? - Thought you'd never ask. - It's a raid! - Fire! Fire! - Yeah ha! - Let's go! Let's go! - Attack! (yelling) (people screaming) - Vera! Go, go, get out of here! - Hold on Pops! - Go! Aaargh! (laughing) - What the fuck is this a picnic? Go after them, go! Go! Go! I want her! Go get her now! (men groaning) Ha! Ha! (man screaming) (tense music) (guns banging) (men screaming) (laughing) Yeah! (Pops groaning) - Help me! Can't you see he's hurt. Help me! - Sure, we'll help you! - No! (gun banging) (laughing) - Hold it bitch. - Get her up here, come on. (laughing) Get her in the car! (dark, depressing music) - Who was it? - Hog, Hoghead. - Where's Vera? - Stash the powder in the armory. - Come on, move it! - Bring her to my room. - Ow! - Not bad. Not a bad score, gents. You got a name? - Fuck you. - Good name, Fuck you. I like it, has a nice ring to it. Fuck you, Kingsley, Gonzales, Fuck you! (laughing) You know any good jokes Fuck you? Oh. I never get to hear any more jokes you know. Nobody's got it. She's a fighter, I like that, that I like. You think she's a screamer too? God I hope so. Fuck you, I got a joke for you. You want to hear it, you want to hear my joke? It's a good one. - Here's the joke. (heads banging) - Oh! - Where you going bitch? - I'm gonna clock your ass. Fuck me, Fuck you. Nobody's done that in a while. I'm gonna take my time with you. Get her out of here. Jesus Christ. - The fuck do we have here? - Bosses special goods. Put her in the bridal suite. Sleep tight babe. Nobody touches her but the boss. - Right, nobody but the boss okay. - For now, my turn will come later. - Talbot! - Yeah! Oh my God, Vera! - This was an old man I buried here. There was a woman. But they took her. - Hoghead? - Bunch of his scumbags. - You know where they went? - These tracks won't last long if this wind picks up. - Which way are you headed? - Ballentine. - Let's go. - Fire! Fire! (yelling) - Ha! Ha! Let's go! (machine gunfire clattering) - Where's the gunpowder? - Gunpowder? We haven't got any gunpowder. - This is a potassium mine isn't it? - Sure, but it's all played out. Ain't no powder here mister. - Search every inch of the place. - Search this place from top to bottom. Go on, move out. - Let's go. - This is a waste of ammunition. Can't afford to use it up on nothing. - We've got to beef up our forces. - And I think I know just how. - Hey bro, how'd you find me? - Just followed the smell. - (laughs) Get your ass in here. - Okay. - Get a move on sugar pie, got a whole army waiting on you. You're off tonight babe. Got some high-level talks in progress and I do mean high. - Fine, I'd rather spend the night with Meatball. - How you fixed for gunpowder? - I'm doing fine. - Yeah? - Yeah. - How about staking me with some of your surplus. (laughing) Momma never did teach you how to lie. - Fuck off. - If you're running short. Powder, me too. Sort of puts a cramp on your lifestyle doesn't it. (laughs) The man with the powder rules. You know who that is? The Alpha League. You think they just gonna sit there. You weren't made to take shit off nobody. I wasn't made to take shit off nobody. Turn your back on me bro, you're gonna lose everything you love. - What say we go in, blow this old man away. (both laughing) - Yeah, you got a million years of terror stored up in there just waiting to get out. (laughing) (suspenseful music) (yelling) - How you feeling? What's your name? - Sierra. - I'm Brodie, that's Talbot. - Where'd you come from? - Far away. - What am I supposed to do with you? - I can take care of myself. - Yeah, sure. Here, have some water. Hey, where are you going? - Nice looking girl. What is it? You came here because of this, because of a reward? - Worry about your wife Talbot. Over there. - Those two. - Easy. Maybe they can lead you to Vera. Follow them, I'll catch up. (shouting excitedly) Hey, what's going on? - They don't want them here. They say bad for business. - What's the matter? Can't stand the competition? What are you looking at? - What do you want? - Whatever you got with the strongest kick. - 100 bucks a shot. What are you paying with? - Nothing. - Hey, what are you doing? I said I want something to drink. All I want is a couple of shots. - There's a hundred bucks in there, grab it, it's yours. - He's poisonous. - No gloves. - Last guy who tried that, why he's got himself a little grave up on the hill. - Takes about 30 seconds for the juice to set in once he bites. Don't it Kingsley? - I've seen it before, it's gruesome. - Nice move. - Nice throw. - You rat bastard, it almost bit me. - Hey relax, relax. Get the man a drink. Hell he earned it. (laughs) (speaking in a foreign language) - You speak their language. Ask him something for me. Ask him if they've heard any talk. - About what? - Black powder that flashes, hidden in the mountains someplace. - You've heard this? - Ask him. (speaking foreign language) (laughs) - Why's he laughing? - He's heard the stories. Everybody's heard them. - Tell me. (speaking foreign language) - A lost tribe in the mountains, sun worshipers, magic dust, they call it Black Quinn, they use it in their ceremonies. - Where in the mountains? (speaking foreign language) - He says Agila Point. - Agila Point? To the east, that's a helluva long way. - So what brings you to Ballantine? - Passing through, nothing left in the car. - Well hell son, why don't you throw in with us. I just might have something for ya. This might be your lucky day. - You don't belong in the desert do you? Where do you belong? How'd those hunters get hold of you? - I was alone. - You think I ask a lot of questions don't you? - What you got here girl. Looks like gunpowder to me? - Watch it. (grunting) - What's going on out there? - Come on! (yelling) - Well we're going back to camp. Coming with us or not? - Yeah I'm coming. - Best move you ever made. (suspenseful music) - Look soldiers! - I'm looking for recruits. I got food. You can join me or you can stay, which will it be? - I'm not going anywhere, I'm staying here. Oooh! (laughing) - Anybody else want to stay? (slow, gentle music) - What's wrong? - Where'd you get this? You come from Agila Point don't you? Is that why he was laughing, your little friend? You're from the mountains. So why were you alone in the desert? - I was on a spirit quest. All my people do it when they reach a certain age. My father was once a warrior like you. Not any more. He led my people into the mountains when I was a baby, no more fighting. (gun firing) (men laughing and yelling) - You guys won't learn will you? - Aaargh! Aaargh! Oh my eyes, aaargh! Oh my eyes! (speaking foreign language) - To close the wound, otherwise he lose his arm. (groaning) - Yeah, you see with you and your reinforcements, we can level those motherfuckers and kick the shit out of them. - New man here, his name's Talbot. What's up? - Clay's asking for help. They spotted a yellow-vested convoy en route to Window Rock. - Yeah, they're going for a reason. Clay figures it must be black powder. (yelling) Yeah. - Come on. (groaning) - What's wrong? - I don't feel so hot. I think it's that schlop you've been feeding us. - Maybe I can make you feel a little better huh. Hey baby, how's that huh? (prisoner's yelling) (suspenseful music) (gunfire) - Don't move lady. - Wait, don't hurt her. She's the boss's girl. Alright, take her back to her cell. - Where are we going? - I'm taking you home. I'll take care of you. (shouting in foreign language) - Sierra, I thought I'd never see you again. Who's he? - He saved my life, please let him stay till he's well. - I have a feeling, the sooner we get this stuff back to the fort the better sir. - Right, our reserves are low enough as it is. The last thing we want is for Clay to get his hands on it. Incoming, take cover! (machine guns rattling) Fall back! Get back! - Let's go. - Get back! (laughing) Fall back! (ominous music) - Thanks for the gunpowder captain. - Go to hell Clay. - I'll return the favor by saving you the embarrassment of making you report to Shelton. - Not a bad haul, huh bro? - Not bad, but not nearly enough to get the job done. Take this back to your camp. I'll keep looking. Ackerman, let's go. - Okay, keep going. (slow, gentle music) - He's a strong man, in the morning he'll be better. - His strength comes from his heart. He's a good man. - He's a soldier. We don't need his world coming in here. We just don't need it. - Powder burns! - The mountain girl. Gunpowder, she's got it. - Where is this girl? - Gone, gone! Can you help me. (screaming) - What do you call your village? - Puerto del Sol. - Gate to the sun. I can see why your father doesn't want people coming here. All my life I've been fighting. Right now, for the first time, I feel I know what it means to live in peace. Must be a couple of tons of this. Have you been working this mine? - This is the way we found it 20 years ago. The miners abandoned it. - Stuff is still volatile. - We only use it in our ceremonies. You should never have brought him here Sierra. You've been teaching our young men how to fight. - They know already. I'm only giving them pointers. There's a war on you know. - It would be better if we don't get involved. - You know this makes you vulnerable. - But if no one knows then nothing can happen to us. Will you tell them? - I have to. You have a potassium mine. - If you do, they'll destroy us. - Yeah what is it? - Couple of the boys just brought in this desert hunter. - We were up on the hill hunting boar. We caught a girl. - The one with the powder. - Where'd you find her? - Up there. - How far. - A few miles. - You show us. - What about the reward? - You'll get the reward when we get the powder. (ominous music) - It's Utopia Talbot, is this everything you ever wanted or what? - Where are all those women you keep bragging about. - We keep 'em under lock and key where they belong. What's the matter son, you got an itch in your jock strap? - Yeah, just like everybody else around here. - Well you hang on to it. We got a way of doing things around here. Wait here. - So where'd you pick up this new guy Talbot. - Ballantine. I wouldn't trust him? - Why not? - Cause I think he's a yellow vest. - So what? So what if he is a yellow vest. So maybe he won't tell Shelton where we are. You're starting to get it Gonzales. You know, it ain't easy being the boss, cause I got to think of everything. Where's Talbot? - He's outside. - Think I'll have a little chat with him. - Man, that asshole just gave me another one of his fuckin' lectures. I'm sick of it. - Hey relax man, take a laxative. - Look at this guy sneaking around the stockade. Hey asshole! You're Talbot right, come over here. Kingsley tells me you want in the game, why? - Why not? - What else is there to say. You're in Talbot. Go ahead, relax, settle in. Grab a broad, have some booze, have fun, go ahead. Oh one thing. I forgot, I'm getting old. - What? - Your initiation. (laughing) - By order of the great dude Hoghead. Initiation time. (cheering) Tonight, a face off to the death. New guy Talbot versus Gonzo Gonzales. (crowd cheering) - Fuck you! Come here. - Don't snap your fingers at me, I'll bite them off. - To the death. - Yeah! - Kingsley. - Gonzo. (cheering) (tense music) - Do you know any jokes? - What? - Everybody enjoys a game, got to have a joke. What's the matter, you can't think of one? (laughs) Get him out of here. (slow, gentle music) - What is it? You're going back. - I have to report to my commander. - You don't have to. As far as they know you're dead. - Look, sooner or later people are going to find out about the mine. Now maybe the wrong people. If you turn it over to the League now, they can protect you. Porta del Sol will be safer that way. - No! You can't tell them about us! - I'll talk to Joaquin tomorrow. I'll convince him. - Please don't go, don't leave me. (gong ringing) - What do you want? - Gunpowder. - We don't have any. - Then you won't object if we have a look around. - Nobody enters the village, we don't want trouble. - Fire! (laughing) (machine guns clattering) - Sierra! - Brodie! Rocket! (shouting in foreign language) (man groaning) Rockets! (Ackerman laughing) Ackerman, what do you see? We just struck gold. - Get some pails, kegs, pack it up. (shouting) - Payback time. - Wake up Meatloaf! Time to get this man laid. - Got a whole bag full of goodies over here. You can have any one you want. Except for her. Come on up and at 'em girls. Service with a smile. Open it up. (gun bangs) - Meatloaf let him go! He's my husband. - Wait. I'll get it open. - Here take this. (tense music) (machine gun clatters) - Urgh, fuck. - Meatloaf! - Go and find out what the hell's going on around here. Hey don't you be putting on my hoghead. If you do I'll know, I'll fucking know. Shit! Get the fuck out of my car, get out! It's my car! (shouting) Come on. (yelling) (machine gun clattering) - Hold on! We better go. (speaking foreign language) - Come on Joaquin don't give up, we've got to get out. Got to get that powder to Shelton. I've got to stop Clay. - But how are you gonna stop him. - Listen. (tapping) (muttering) - Why don't you come with us? - Too many of my people have paid the price. For us, it stops right here. - For me, it can't. - She loved you Brodie. - He may have the troop strength, but does he have sufficient gunpowder to launch an assault. - He took the Window Rocks blind. He didn't intend on stopping there. - Hmmm, well if he attacks, we can't hold out for long. Our own supply is badly in need of replenishment. - Any word on Brodie. - Nothing. You better get some rest. Oh and Talbot. - Sir? - It's good to have you back. - Thank you sir. (yelling) - My brother's dead! I know what it takes bro, I've been dreaming about this all my life. My brother and I, beating the shit out of anybody who got in the way of what we wanted. I go to war. I have all the gunpowder we need. Do it for him! Do it for him. Show them no fucking mercy. Who's with me! (men yelling) (dramatic, ominous music) - When the fighting starts. Tell the men to aim carefully. We can't afford to waste ammunition. We've got to make every bullet count. - What the fuck! It's Brodie. Stop him! - Gunpowder! - Man I thought we'd lost you. Talbot start packing rounds, put as many men on it as we can spare. - I hope it lasts. - Launch the attack. - Alright move it, let's go! (men yelling) - Let's go guys. - Let's go! - Let's go! Fall back! - Go! (men yelling) - What's going on? - They broke in through on both flanks. The ammunition's gone. We can't hold them. - Fall back. (yelling) (whooping and howling) - Mountain people! - Aaah! - Oooh! - Urgh! (whooping) - Cover the stairs. Kill him!
