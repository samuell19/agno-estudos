(WOMAN LAUGHlNG) l was surprised to see your name on the crew list this morning. Life is full of surprises. You still take it black? Mmm-hmm. l heard you retired. For a short time. l've changed my mind. l'm glad you did. ls there anything else you need, Captain? (SPEAKlNG FRENCH) METRAND: lt is still amazing to me. Only three hours and a half ago we were in Paris. The world seems so small. Thank you, Dulles. They want us to park on 23. There's going to be a ceremony when Federation officially takes ownership of the plane. Tell them we'll be right there. Concorde Flight 28, you're clear for landing. MAN: (OVER RADlO) Roger, Dulles. Holy Christ. What is over the runways, Dulles? (SPEAKlNG FRENCH) Full power. Go around. Gear up! Gear up. WOMAN: Oh, my God ! What's happening? The three balloonists, two men and a young woman, members of the radical environmentalist group, Airpeace, surrendered to Virginia State Police. The Concorde flight 28 was en route from Paris. The airplane was recently purchased by Federation World Airlines, making it America's first supersonic commercial carrier. A spokesman for the airline said that today's incident would not change their plans to make a pre-Olympic goodwill flight to Moscow on the Concorde tomorrow. ln other news, Harrison lndustries today unveiled its highly secret Buzzard Project. Science editor Jeffrey Marks was at Harrison lndustries' Maryland test facility for this special report. MARKS: Since 1974, Harrison lndustries has been developing for the Air Force the Buzzard Attack Drone, the newest weapon in the United States arsenal. A radio-controlled, unmanned target plane is being sent out over the ocean. Conceived of by Dr. Kevin Harrison, chairman of Harrison lndustries, the Buzzard was designed by Harrison's chief designer, Willie Halpern. Capable of speeds that exceed twice the speed of sound, the attack drone has an interception range of over 1,000 miles and a hitherto unheard of rate of successful kills close to 100%. Guided by television cameras set into its nose and an on-board computer system, the Buzzard shows its muscle. Once locked to its prey, the super-fast bird electronically homes in on its target. At Harrison lndustries' test facility, this is Jeffrey Marks for Nightly News. Testing of the drone will continue at the Harrison facility at daybreak tomorrow. ln a related story, the prestigious United States Science Foundation has named Dr. Kevin Harrison as their Man of the Year for his achievements in advancing aerospace technology. Dr. Harrison, 43, chairman of the conglomerate Harrison lndustries, was graduated from Harvard with a doctorate in physics. Dr. Harrison lives in Washington with his wife and three children. Members of the Russian Olympic team concluded a weeklong goodwill tour at the Cole Fieldhouse at the University of Maryland this afternoon. As a continuing feature leading to our exclusive coverage of the 22nd Olympiad in Moscow, Robert Palmer gives us this special look at these fine athletes. Sport has always been a tapestry of contrasts, a never-ending variety of movement. The epitome of grace, Alicia Rogov, was the all-round women's gymnastics gold medal winner in Munich and Montreal. She'll be trying for an unprecedented third gold medal in Moscow. Just another facet of the 22nd Olympiad. This is Robert Palmer for Nightly News. (SlNGlNG lN RUSSlAN) Can I interview you for American television? Are you crazy? What are you doing here? My viewers want the whole story. lt's up close and personal. l will scream if you don't leave! Please, do not scream. l'm just gonna ask you a few questions. How does it feel to be a national hero? Would you look right into the camera? Ladies and gentlemen, we're talking today with Miss Alicia. . . Rogov! Thanks. Come on, American. lnterview me. All right, Miss Rogov. Tell us why it's so important for you to win three gold medals. You're 24. lsn't that a little old for competition? Old? I want to show everyone, you don't have to be 15 with a figure like boy to win gold medal. Anything else, Mr. Reporter? Whatever happened to the shy young woman l met four years ago in Montreal? She grew up and fell in love. Nelli ! Alicia! Please! Very soon the bus is leaving for the hotel. (GlGGLES) What? Something amuses you. The bubbles. They tickle in strange places. l want you to put all your strange places into nice, dry clothes. Now. She's gone, Robert. Robert! Robert Palmer! Thanks for the interview. Come back here, Robert Palmer. Thanks, Walter. Any time, Joe. l won't, Paul. l know. Just friends. You don't know how much you hurt me when you left. l never wanted to hurt you. lt doesn't take very much. lsabelle, can I tell you something very personal? Mmm-hmm. Your hair is in my French fries. l won't let you hurt me again. (DOORBELL RlNGS) Hold on ! l'm coming ! (DOORBELL RlNGS) l'm coming ! Who is it? Miss Whelan? My name is Carl Parker. l'm the assistant sales director for Harrison lndustries. We met at an open house you had here for the World Hunger Council. l need your help. l'm sorry. l would've called, but your number's not listed. No, it's all right. Please, come in. Well, I only have a minute. Miss Whelan, you're an important person. You have influence. Now, they'll listen to you. l don't understand. What is the problem? l have information that Harrison lndustries, through their overseas operations, have been making illegal sales of arms for the last 15 years. Harrison lndustries? Weapons were sold to the North Vietnamese during our war there. Weapons that killed a lot of our men. Come on. That's ridiculous. No! They've secretly sold arms to Cuba, to Syria and Uganda, arsenals to terrorist groups. Can you prove any of this? l have the documents that detail the sales. l've locked them away in a safe place. l gave my wife the key and l've asked her to deliver them to you tomorrow morning. l'm leaving for Paris in the morning. Now if these documents exist, we can go see them now. No! They have people looking for me. l have to leave town. Now let me just go up and get changed, and I can be right. . . But you don't understand ! MAN: Mr. Parker? (DlALlNG) WHELAN: Hello? Hello! Hello, operator! Help! Help me! Please, somebody, help! Help me! Please! Please! Help me! Help me! Please! (ALARM RlNGlNG) (WHELAN WHlMPERlNG) (GASPlNG) Captain Metrand? Captain Metrand, Joe Patroni. Oh. l'm gonna be flying with ya. Just wanted to say hello. l'm sorry, Captain. l went to bed early. Oh, I didn't mean to disturb you. Get some sleep and we'll talk tomorrow. Good night to you, too, honey! l've heard a lot about you, Captain. So I knew that terrific perfume wasn't yours. (CHUCKLES) Oh. . . Carl was a friend of mine. He worked for me for almost 20 years. This is unbelievable. l was standing right next to him. (SNlFFLlNG) One minute he's talking to me. Then. . . (SOBBlNG) Oh, God ! lt was horrible! Kevin, he said there were documents. Documents that proved that Harrison lndustries has been making illegal arms sales. You would have to approve those sales. Documents? What did Carl think he was doing? Somebody in my organization must be trying to blackmail me. l just can't understand how Carl got involved. He always seemed like such a decent, kind man. Why would your own people want to blackmail you? Because big business is like that kid's game, King of the Mountain. When you're on top, somebody always wants to knock you on your ass. Are you saying you've never made illegal arms sales? Maggie, l'm a very rich man. l have everything in life I could ever want. Why would I jeopardize that by doing something so incredibly stupid? (SNlFFLES) Blow your nose. Sweet Maggie. Sweet, sweet Maggie. l love you so much. You're cold. Yeah. Morning, Willie. Good morning, K. H. Look like you haven't slept. My grandchild is staying with us. She slept in the same bed with us all night. My three kids used to climb in with us. lt was like a disco on Saturday night. Carl Parker is dead. Did we get the documents back? No. And there's somebody else involved. Maggie Whelan knows about them. What time is the drone test scheduled for? 6:30. A little over an hour from now. l want it delayed until 8:00. We've been together a long time, haven't we, Willie? Twenty-two years. (CLEARS THROAT) Almost half my life. This could destroy everything we've worked for. l need your help, Willie. How difficult would it be to reprogram the drone? No problem at all. Where'd you get your training? (SPEAKS FRENCH) Early on, l was flying cargo to Saigon during the war we had in lndoChina. Then I flew the Mirage. l was a military advisor in Saigon when we first got in the war. l remember this Eurasian gal. She had these great big blue eyes. They called her the Tarantula. Did you ever run into her? No. I don't think so. You'd remember her if you did. She was a real ball-breaker. Now here's a beautiful lady. METRAND: Yes. You have good taste, Joseph. There's nothing like her in the skies. She can maneuver with a military jet. Go just as fast and a lot farther. l think l'm falling in love. The instructors at the Concorde flight school in Toulouse tell me you scored very high in their testing. Nothing but gold stars. Just like you, Paul. Ever since I was a little boy, anything that flies has been my hobby. How long have you been flying? l stopped counting after 30 years. Flown just about every aircraft there is through three wars and 40 pounds. The only thing l'm afraid of is heights. You afraid of anything, Metrand? American pilots. Captain. (lNDlSTlNCT CHATTER) Coach Markov, can we get a picture of you and Gregori Valdikoff together picture? What? This little muzhik? Sure. Right. Right. Now. (LAUGHTER) (SPEAKlNG RUSSlAN) What'd he say? What'd he say? He says l'm a genius. Coach, what did the team enjoy most about the United States? The children. Wonderful, happy children. This is my daughter, lrina. Her name sign is lrina. lrina, is the Coach a good father? She says l'm an ugly bear. She must know something. Excuse me. Thank you. Are you excited about taking the Concorde? (LAUGHS) (SPEAKlNG RUSSlAN) What'd he say? How should I know? You're still on that diet? Barely just. Last night l came within that much of a big, juicy steak. What'd you eat? Fruit compote. lt was torture. l woke up in the middle of the night in a cold sweat. l dreamt I was being chased by a giant banana. (CHUCKLlNG) (SPEAKlNG FRENCH) No cream and sugar for me. Two cups, black. Two cups, black. Oh, you pilots are such men. They don't call it the cockpit for nothing, honey. Wait a minute! That perfume of yours smells awfully familiar. (SPEAKlNG FRENCH) What'd she say? Probably the same as you say in English. Thank you. How we doing? Just waiting for Maggie Whelan. Listen. All I wanna know, are you sure there was nothing delivered for me at the studio? l mean, like a package, an envelope, something like that? Okay. l'll talk to you from Paris. Kevin. l was worried about you. You're too much. l wanted to make sure everything is okay. lt's okay. l'm exhausted, that's all. You can sleep on the airplane. Miss Whelan, l'm going to have to lock the door. Did those mysterious documents turn up? No. You were right as usual. Bon voyage, you beautiful lady. ANNOUNCER: Your attention, please. Take care of yourself. The mobile lounge for Federation World Airlines Concorde... l will. You, too. ...to Paris and Moscow is ready for immediate departure from Gate 14. This is your final call... WOMAN: Maggie! ...for the Concorde's mobile lounge. All aboard, please. Maggie! Have a wonderful trip. Thank you. Miss Whelan. Maggie! You killed him ! You murdered Carl ! Killer! That'll do. lt's okay. Excuse me. Was the additional ice put on board? lt's in the freezer. lt's just a precaution. We shouldn't need it. The heart's been packed in plenty of ice. What we need now is a really fast trip. Excuse me, please. Would you mind very much if I sat right here? Of course not. Thank you. l'll hang that. Thank you. The transplant is for your son? Yes. He just turned seven. (SNlFFLlNG) And so the colonel says, "No, ya fathead, "you're supposed to ride the camel to town !" There you are. l couldn't figure out where you ran off to. Paul, Joe. This old lady here is my wife, Amy. She's stoned on Dramamine. Tell her she's got nothing to worry about. lt's just like taking a bus, Mrs. Sande. She's afraid of buses, too. l think you better throw my husband out of here. He wants to fly the plane. Okay. Okay. Have fun, boys. All right. We'll see you later. Uh-huh. Nice-looking lady. ls he really her husband? She's his fourth wife. He always was a horny bastard. There's this story that back in the '20s when he was barnstorming, he made a bet that he could put it to this good-looking wing walker. He boffed her out on the wing 1,000 feet above El Paso. His ass got so sunburned he couldn't sit down for a week. (LAUGHlNG) Who is he? That's your boss, sweetheart. Eli Sande, president of Federation Airlines. Hey, Coach ! (SPEAKlNG lNDlSTlNCTLY) Ma'am. Could you wait until we take off, please? Well, I have this bladder condition. When l'm nervous, l. . . l really enjoyed your farewell concert at Carnegie Hall. lt was a classic. Thank you. lt's nice to be remembered. l could never figure out why you retired. Well, honey, the road's a killer. When I woke up not knowing what town I was in, l decided it was time to quit. This yours? Yeah. Get that for me? Thank you. Did I read you're going to be in the Moscow Jazz Festival? Yeah ! lt's kind of a homecoming for me. That's fabulous. l was born in Moscow. l haven't been back since l was about five years old. Long time. That's great. I'll be there, front row and center to cheer you on. Oh, thank you, love. (PLAYS TUNE) The Lord is my shepherd and I see what I want. (PLAYS A NOTE) l'm sorry, sir. You're gonna have to store that for takeoff. l can put it in the cupboard for you. Obviously, my dear, you don't congeal the situation here. See, this is my Siamese twin. We go everywhere together. Right, Gretch? Oh, that's right. They even sleep together. You know, everybody's doing it. (ENGlNE ROARlNG) Robert. Why don't you defect? You would make a good Russian. l don't want to be a Russian. l don't want to be American. But that's great. We'll live in Sweden. Marriage is too complicated. Let's just do interviews? (SPEAKlNG RUSSlAN) Forgive me. Excuse me, sir. Sonia, I want to sit there. You could sit in my seat. (MAN OVER RADlO) Concorde, Dulles Tower. Radar has a two-minute hold on you. Hold in position. Concorde. lnto position and hold. MAN: (OVER PA) Attention, please.

Did you ever get married? Not a chance. Just a lot of fooling around. That'll keep you healthy. Depends on who you're fooling around with, l guess. Peter? Will you give my friend a hand? Good to see ya. Thank you, Joe. l'll try. What number is it? Ladies and gentlemen, this is your captain, Joe Patroni. We'd like to welcome you all aboard. Our flying time to Paris today will be three hours and 50 minutes. We'll be climbing up to an altitude of 59,000 feet. Our cruising speed will be Mach 2. That's roughly 1,400 miles an hour, twice the speed of sound. The cabin will remain pressurized to a comfortable 6,000 feet. And you'll barely notice the speed. Enjoy your flight. lt's ringing. Maggie? l have the documents, Kevin. l can't believe it. Your signature. l don't want to believe any of this. (WHlSPERS) You had Carl Parker killed ! l didn't, Maggie! l've done a lot of things l've been ashamed of, but I am not a murderer! You know, l'm not sure l really know you at all. When we hang up, l'm gonna call my news department. l'm gonna tell them about the documents. You wanna hang me without an explanation ! You hung yourself. What's left to explain? A lot. l'll meet you in Paris. lf you really care about me, you won't do anything about those documents until I get there. l'll see you in Paris. (SOBBlNG) Maggie, you okay?

Does Ella still have it? Does Sinatra still have it? Does Sarah Vaughn still have it? Well, Gretchen Carter definitely has it. You're like fine wine. You get better with age. And you're gonna get those Russians drunk. Little Buddy's heart has failed twice since he collapsed. lt's a miracle he's still alive. They don't expect him to last the week though. Must not have been easy to find a heart for him. lt's all computerized. Thousands of hospitals around the world. What they do is look for a heart with compatible tissues for transplanting. Oh, God ! lt sounds so cold. And they found it last night? Yes. A couple of days ago there was an accident and a little girl suffered brain damage and died. Her heart survived and. . . Buddy has a chance to live, if we ever get there in time. Don't worry. He's gonna make it just fine. You're sweet. Thank you. (lNDlSTlNCT RADlO CHATTER) We have a computer malfunction.

Please sit down and fasten your seat belts. What's happening? We're not turning back are we? No. There's probably some turbulence ahead. That's all. (REPEATlNG HORN BLAST) PATRONl: Sorry to bother you, folks, but Washington Center has advised us of some military traffic in our air space. There's a possibility we may be asked to make some minor course changes. You'll be more comfortable if you please stay seated with your seat belts fastened. l'm gonna put on some music, but l'd appreciate it if you don't dance in the aisles. That's one l never heard before. People relax if you sound relaxed. You should hear my yawn. (BEEPlNG) The drone's locked on target. Four o'clock, Joseph ! (SCREAMlNG) Where did it go? Shouldn't we continue evasive action, sir? No. Those attack drones lock on with a guidance system. lf we start juking around the sky, that needle-nose bugger will nail us when we can't see him. Let it make the first move. Here it comes! (SCREAMlNG) l can't shake that bug bastard. F-15s at ten o'clock. He's dead. The fighter's too close. lf he overshoots, we'll end up with a missile in our laps. (CHEERlNG) (EXHALES) Does that hurt? No. How 'bout that? No. And l'm glad to see that nobody is hurt, but we do have a doctor on board if anybody needs one. Oh, Captain ! Ma'am? Um. . . Who's driving the plane? lt's on automatic pilot, ma'am. Ladies and gentlemen, may I have your attention, please? Now if everyone's okay, we're gonna continue on our course to Paris. We've run a complete check on the aircraft, and everything is in perfect running order. What happened, Joe? All we know is that a military test vehicle accidentally strayed into our air space. We had to make some adjustments in order to avoid a collision. Those were some adjustments. Good work, Joe. (APPLAUDlNG) (SPEAKlNG RUSSlAN) Oh. You deserve a rest, Captain. Oui, oui, Kevin. Hmm. Some things are necessary. There's only tragedy and drama. lt's done. Ah ! Thank you, Kevin. Mmm. (SPEAKS FRENCH) Samantha, is my plane ready? And so, this famous gold bear says, "Who's sleeping "in my bed?" (SPEAKlNG RUSSlAN) (OVER lNTERCOM) Mr. Harrison, this is Captain Moyer. Mr. Robelle is calling from Paris, sir. Put him through. André? Oui, Kevin. l'm putting us on a scrambler. (BEEPlNG) Go ahead. The fighter plane should be airborne now. What about the French Air Force? lt's flying under French coastal radar. When he makes his attack, he'll have four minutes before the Air Force responds. Four minutes will be an eternity for the Concorde. l'll be in Paris before dark. Very good, Kevin. MAN: (OVER RADlO) Good afternoon, Concorde. This is Paris Control. Go ahead, please. Nice to be with you, Paris Control. We've just passed 10 degrees west. We should be on the ground in under an hour. lSABELLE: Ladies and gentlemen, we are starting our gradual descent for landing at Charles de Gaulle Airport in Paris. Captain Metrand has turned on the seat belt sign. He requests that you stay seated with your seat belts fastened. Thank you. Oh, please, madame. Would you mind taking your seat?

Please monitor French Air Force traffic on the following... Paris Control, can you read me? (STATlC) Hello? Hello? We've lost communication with Paris Control, Captain. Jesus Christ. There's an armed Phantom, and he's coming right for us. Full power. Goddamn ! He fired one! Missile at five o'clock! Those missiles have a narrow seeking angle, no more than 30 degrees. lf we make enough violent maneuvers, we may be able to cause a flyby. You son of a bitch ! (SCREAMlNG) Oh, no. Something's happening again. O'NElL: Mayday! Mayday! This is Concorde. We're under attack by an unmarked fighter plane. Mayday! This is Concorde. Please respond. l'd love to see what my horoscope said for this morning. He's got three more. The plane will break up if I do anymore violent aerobatics. We need to send a false target. With the Very pistol. The flare is small, but it's hot. O'Neill, emergency! Depressurize! O'NElL: Depressurizing. (AlR HlSSlNG) Everybody, please put on your oxygen masks! Turn it over!

We still don't know who attacked the aircraft. As soon as we get any information, we'll pass it right on to you. ln a few minutes we're going to be touching down at our alternate airport in Paris, where barrier nets will assist our landing if needed. Thank you. The bathroom's broken. You boys okay? The only problem is we may not be able to stop this big lady. The reverse thrusters are out on one side, sir. No brakes? The hydraulic system is damaged. l don't know if they're going to work or not. My wife thinks we'll all be safe if l'm up here in the cockpit. l'll ride it out with you.

Miss Whelan, have you heard that four terrorist groups have taken credit for the attack as a protest against the Olympics? The world's gone mad. Excuse me. lf this plane is ready, we're going to Moscow tomorrow! l'll be damned if anybody's gonna stop this flight! Was this a publicity stunt? Repair work gonna be done here? lf everything's up to specs, the crew will ferry her to de Gaulle late tonight. lsabelle!

(EXCLAlMS lN FRENCH) My son just started college. The Sorbonne. College? You don't look old enough to have a child in the fifth grade. Just makeup. Oh, no. What is your son to study? Medicine. What a coincidence! So is my Phillipe. We have a lot in common, Captain. You're a very shy man. My wife used to say that. An understanding woman is very important.

Maggie, would you look at this for me? Writing is not my strong suit. Maybe you can polish the rough edges. l need some air, Kevin. (WHlSTLES) (CAR ENGlNE STARTS) l feel like walking, Kevin. You did it again, stormy. You said it wouldn't rain. Let's go to your hotel. ls that gonna solve everything? l'm gonna broadcast the documents as soon as I get to Moscow. lt'll be old news by then. l made you a promise. A promise? You made me a promise? Oh ! What a pathetic joke. Maggie, the hotshot reporter. The great judge of character. l was never gonna fall in love and get hurt. That couldn't happen to me. Oh, damn it. l fell so hard. Talk about love being blind. Oh, Kevin Harrison, you are perfect, though. Attractive, charming, intelligent. And destructive. Why couldn't you be straight with me? l would've done anything for you. l've never loved anyone the way I love you. But it's over. Saddest part of the whole thing is that I still love you.

Today, when we were that far above the ocean, life seemed very short. The plane is here at de Gaulle. The repairs are completed. MAN: A bomb, Froelich? No. Bombs are unreliable. This way is certain. When the door opens, the change in pressure will tear the plane apart. How long before the Concorde is destroyed? Ten minutes. lt's not quick, but it's completely efficient. When I give you the money, leave France. Yes, sir. At 4:00, it will be finished. Tell your friend to enjoy himself. lt's better to be rich.
