Ying, there's news about wah come to the police station Nam nam A hiker found this two days ago and brought it to us here, you can keep his badge the police will no longer be involved in this case it's been seven years since the incident our protocol states that we can't continue the investigation his badge is best in your keeping in my keeping? I kept a lot of things too but what's the point? I thought you asked me to come up here to let me know if there were any developments now that we've found his badge, there's hope but you're telling me you're gonna stop investigating? Ying, calm down you know I want to find wah as well where did you find his badge? At wah's last known location around the snake stone in sai kung who found it? A regular citizen but something doesn't feel right to him I want to meet him alright I want to know, where did you find this badge? I'm not obliged to say anything but whatever I say, can't be used in a court of law hey, she's asking you a question I've already answered you before, madam you don't belive me, yet you've asked your subordinate to question me what do you want? I'm not a cop this is my father, he's been missing for a long time please tell me more it's a place that doesn't exist on map hey, what are you doing? Don't you wanna know where I went? Open the gate now! What did you think I would do? Alright since neither of you believe me, leave now I believe you I want to know where you found this badge please tell me, I beg you many people have searched for him for seven years but we've found nothing you were the only one who found something so I want you to tell me more as you said, it's been seven years he'd be dead even if we found him at least I'd have an answer I won't give up until I find him what if I told you when I was there I saw my wife who died five years ago? Would you believe me? Yes, I would but what I say would sounds ridiculous I don't want others to think I'm a lunatic nam It's an enchanted realm it was a very foggy day before I went into the enchanted realm, I kept going on the same path after god-knows how long, I finally left but I couldn't locate myself on a map and my compass doesn't work I kept walking and walking it must've been more than seven days but it never got dark I never got hungry or thirsty I saw a lot of people walk by hey but they couldn't hear me at all hey hey finally, I saw a beam of light I walked towards it And there she was, my late wife as I was approaching I came back out I went back to the mountains a few times but I couldn't get into the enchanted realm how did you get in in the first place? I have no idea but I think it's a realm that is fluid in nature it doesn't have a fixed entrance or exit and certain conditions need to be met in order to get in I'm still trying to figure it out for the first few months after my father went missing I was at the mountains every day but I never crossed into the enchanted realm I found his badge at the enchanted realm if you couldn't get in, you wouldn't be able to find him so you're saying that my father is in that realm? Yes enough ying, let's go this is absolute nonsense let me ask you are your dreams real? Yes - why? Because they feel real but how can you quantify your feelings? Do you have tangible evidence? And the place you were in your dream was it real? A dream is a dream, what are you on about? Ying, he's crazy why are you still listening to him? I guess it's time for this lunatic to take his pills both of you, leave I beg you, please tell me more about the realm get out! Let's go ying, ying it's been seven years if he's really still alive, he wouldn't be in the mountains a badge doesn't mean much can you be more rational about this? He said he was up there for seven days I've asked his family, and they said he was gone for a few hours he's a lying lunatic the police weren't able to find anything of his for the past seven years but this so-called lunatic found something that belonged to my dad should I believe him, or you? I want to find wah as well but that doesn't mean I'm gonna believe anything anyone says I know you think this is ridiculous but I choose to believe at least there's a glimmer of hope Slowly, be careful don't worry, I can handle by myself ching loves you, that's why he hired a maid for you why did you have to fire the maid? That bastard kid no, I've already submitted it wait a second sorry, Vincent yes, it's at home, sorry I'll submit it first thing tomorrow morning ying ma, sorry for the trouble today I'll hire a new maid as soon as possible no worries, I was free today I was just chatting with Mrs. mak I'm fine now, why do I need a maid?

Mrs. mak fired her she's getting more and more stubborn it must be so difficult for ching Mom - hmm? Someone found dad's badge in the mountains Isn't that some kind of hope? But did they find him? Ying, why do you insist on being like this? That's my father you lost your father, I also lost my husband we have to move on mom... I'm going out No one would believe you, but I believe you remember that Auntie? My mom's asleep, if you wanna listen to music, turn it down okay, I know Ying why are you dressed like that? Aren't we going hiking? There's an extra ticket for a band show tonight don't be angry don't band shows start at night? Shouldn't I have dinner with whoever treated me to this show? I'm your dad, you should be hiking with me go on, don't come back too late here's a compass and a map and a cell phone, in case you need to call for help those concert venues are really sketchy you should bring it with you, in case you need to call for help hello? Hey where are we having dinner? You decide honey bye-bye Why? Why are you here? Come play with me, big sister what happened to you? Ying when will you properly meet a guy and bring him home for dinner? You're not young anymore you should think about your future some people went missing in sai kung recently is that so? Those people got what they deserve said there were ghosts, and went there for an adventure nobody would know if they slipped and fell did you look through my notebook? Ying, it's been seven years when can you let it go? I want to ask you as well how can you forget everything about dad? Why did you not leave behind anything he used to own? And you put his picture up there like he's dead didn't I go searching for him? If he wanted to come back, he'd be back already but someone found his badge so do we have to go up to the mountains every day now? It's not been seven days, it's seven years nobody asked you to go up and search for him if you'd rather he be dead, I won't stop you but you can't stop me Hello, suet wing? Miss sit, I just wanted to apologize you've always been good to me suet wing, I didn't take it to heart my parents neglected me, my classmates didn't like me do you remember what I told you? There will be people who like you or dislike you we can't satisfy everybody nobody likes me everything I do is wrong even my parents don't want me, you know how much they hate me they don't hate you I called to thank you for listening to me all this time you're the only person who treats me well good bye, miss sit hello, suet wing? Where are you? Hello? I'm a social worker, I want to go up to 17/f sure, please register I've called the police, they're on their way Suet wing - Hello? - Hello? Is it dad? Ying? Is that you?

Three four's, going for the kill hey, don't! Hey, don't! Help help help help You're finally here? This is not the place, follow me We're here What are you doing here? You're not allowed in sir, I'm a social worker my client called me for help you're so late, we sent that girl to the hospital hours ago hours ago? I know her oh right, I'll get back to work ying, what are you doing here? That's my client in there she called me, and I got here as soon as I could don't worry, she's not in danger but you don't look too well I got lost just now what are you talking about? - Did you arrest that man? - Are you okay? There he was... Ying! Ying, are you okay? Mom? Yes, Vincent didn't you know there was a meeting? What? Meeting? Isn't that tomorrow? Two o'clock on the 4th yes, sorry, I... Sorry, I'll be there soon... Mom! How many times have I told you not to wander around it's very dangerous there you are you've been gone a month, you didn't even call did you spend all your money, and now you're asking me for some? Mom, I made you breakfast this morning come on, let's go home do you have any shame? Mom, let's talk about this at home, okay? There's a lot of people here what cannot be said out here? Are you afraid of people finding out about your bad deeds? You little bastard, everyone you know are imbeciles you only ever ask me for money you talk back at me when you're at home you're the best at acting acting like such a good boy out here it angers me to have a son like you other people have children too, none are as bad as you you nasty little bastard, I regret having you you never do what you promised I hate people who are fake Killing without mercy ying, you're awake that man killed people - you were only dreaming. - It's real that man was killed children in the housing estate I saw a beam of light, just like the one the other guy said he saw I went to the enchanted realm, I really went in there stop your nonsense, okay? The doctor said you had low blood sugar if you carry on like this, you'll faint again also, my father called me he really called me come on, why don't you rest for a bit Yes, Vincent hello, when are you submitting the proposal? I'm working on it now you are rushing? You're always rushing whenever I call you the client is flying off tomorrow morning I need some time, I'll send it to you when I'm done what kind of attitude is this... - Son. - What is it? I'm hungry I'll make you something later How many times have I told you don't bother me while I'm working why don't you ever listen to me? Are you trying to kill me? Is the whole world trying to kill me? Trying to kill me? I'm giving everything up to take care of you every day Mr. ho? I'm not available, just put down the money and go I think I've been into the enchanted realm what about your police friend? She doesn't believe me it was very foggy I kept trying to find my way then I saw a man, slaughtering children That's the enchanted realm what you just said proves that I'm right the enchanted realm appears in places where violence was prevalent just like... I saw a group of Japanese soldiers burying some villagers the enchanted realm is a place where time and space interlace people in the realm will witness deeds of injustice from the past that's why you saw that man killing children did you tell the cops? I'm not actually crazy, okay? Wait a second how did you get out? I saw a beam of light, just like you said The space that the enchanted realm occupies is the same as the real world it's just that the fluidity is different there can be an enchanted realm right here this can still be a mountaineering shop in the enchanted realm we're just not in there at this moment just like parallel universes in films here's a simpler metaphor fluidity same place, but one is going faster and the other is going slower but there will be times when they overlap like the hour-hand and the minute-hand one goes faster, and the other goes slower but they overlap at times and when they overlap the entrance to the enchanted real will open and because of the difference in fluidity the two worlds experience time differently so seven days in the enchanted realm was just a few hours in our world yes. But it was the opposite for me I was only there for a while but when I got out, it's already been a few hours What symptoms did you experience after you got out of the enchanted realm I felt tired, so tired that I fainted my friend sent me to the hospital the doctor said that my blood sugar was low what did you do in the enchanted realm? After I saw the man kill the children I kept on running I get it now I get it now the time you experience in the enchanted realm not only will it be compressed, but it can also be extended which explains the how I was able to spend seven days in the realm without any food or water, and no sleep because I wasn't hungry, sleepy, or thirsty I thought I was in there for seven days but it has only been a few hours for my body that's why I didn't feel sleepy, hungry, or thirsty with the same logic, I was running for a while in there but I've been running for hours in the real world? Right, do you know why? You had low blood sugar from excessive exercise also, when I was in there I received a call from my dad does that mean he's in there somewhere? That's possible but that could also be his spiritual waves I've also received a call from my dead wife when I was there so, there's hope in finding him? - Yes. - How do I get back in? Do you hear weird noises sometimes? Or see strange unexplainable things? Things that only you can see or hear and nobody else can feel? That's it but once I left I didn't see these things again now you have the key to enter the enchanted realm what does that mean? It's magnetic fields it's radio waves you're able to receive radio waves that others can't I'm gonna need your help with getting back in there why do you want to get into the enchanted realm? We are the same we're both looking for answers Mrs. mak ying, there you are your mother left a bag at my place come get it for her sure your mother is a Saint she's always here taking care of me but she's forgetful she was too busy listening to music listening to music? Have a look June 3rd, 1980, chan kin sang, a 55-year-old man heavily in debt, with mental disorders tied up his three daughters, all under ten years old and killed them and commited suicide by falling to his death why are you telling me this? That case happened at lai ching estate, room 1224 that's the same room you said you saw the killing back then, the neighours said that the man kept on saying "killing without mercy" before he committed suicide so the case happened 30 years ago? I also looked at the cctv footage in the building that day and found some abnormalities I've also checked that wah's phone did make a call from sai kung that day So I was really in the enchanted realm? I refuse to believe any of it then how would you explain this? You saw a case from 30 years ago because it was a projection from your subconscious there must've been a signal jam in the cctv so it was footage from another elebator what about the phone call? The radio waves in sai kung are unstable there might be an error in the data so if you don't believe any of this why are you helping me? Wah taught me everything at the academy, he was my mentor He called me on the day he went missing but I was on a case, so I didn't answer so I've always wanted to know the reason behind his disappearance what I can do is to follow every lead on this case nam, I know you don't believe me but can you help me one last time? I've already helped you many 'last times' when did I ever refuse? A women went missing in the mountains early this morning the police speculates that she fell off a cliff this was the sixth disappearance from the mountains in the past two months according to information found on the scene the lady who disappeared is between 50-60 years old son, it's been a while since you've gone on a hike with your dad let's go on a family hike together, okay? Oh, sure when you're free, tell your dad when we were young, we never went to the mall we would always go on hiking dates we saw a snake one time your dad was a big guy, but he was so terrified I had to hold him the whole time he's absolutely useless but when has your father ever been useful? Vincent? No problem, it's all done I've been working on this report for three months we're gonna secure the funding no problem, there will never be anymore problems We're almost at the sharp peak it's close to where wah went missing is anyone there? Help me! Did you hear that? Is anyone there? “What is it? It's dad hey, ying - help - Ying, where are you going? Don't run off save me - ying, stop, wait for me - Is anybody there? Help ying, what's wrong? It's dad the sound came from here did you hear it? It's not here anymore this is it, we're close ying, you can't run off like that, it's too dangerous we can't lose each other let's go back the way we came from let's go I can't do this, I want to go home you wanted to reminisce the past besides, the doctor said you should go out more did you forget that? We didn't have to go so far we're almost there, look I'm really tired It's beautiful, we haven't been here admiring the view for a long time then let's stay here for longer we're so high up, it's so beautiful here mom, I need to take a call, there's no signal here I'll be back real soon Ching?

But I feel really uncomfortable like this then you decide, are we going or not? Don't talk to me like that just leave if you want but watch your tone I'm sorry you're sorry... that's all you know how to say you forget all about it when you wake up that's enough, mom do you think I'm annoying? What did I teach you? You need to be courteous and be considerate I'm gonna get your dad to scold you tonight dad has been dead for three years you unfilial bastard, cursing your father's death I knew you were nasty all along, yelling at me all the time I wish I never gave birth to you I constantly have to care about your feelings I'm already pushed to the brim at work and you're like this at home I'm exhausted dad has been dead for three years it's three years don't mention him again he's not coming back wake up, can you hear me? Mom? Mom? Mom? Mom? Wait a second I remember passing by this place I've put a ribbon here with a marking if we see this ribbon again then it'll prove that we're repeating the same path where are we now? Check your phone - There's no signal. - Me neither - Hello? - Hello, nam is that you?

I was investigating this case when I was fresh out of the academy wah was in charge of this case because of jealousy they used hiking as an excuse to lure them into the mountains He said he was forced to go up to the mountain by three boys the court couldn't convict him due to lack of evidence I was the one who let him walk free aren't you a star athlete? Come and save your girlfriend - Everybody had enough fun? - I'm done, let's go The murder happened on June 5th today is June 5th I went into the enchanted realm two days ago that murder case happened on June 3th it was the same day, I get it now so the gate to the enchanted realm opens on the same day the murder takes place cool what realm?

It's too late did you know how heartbroken your mother was?
