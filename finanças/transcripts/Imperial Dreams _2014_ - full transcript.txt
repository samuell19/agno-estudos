"Like those poor niggas in North Korea who have to serve time for something their granddaddy thought." "They don't even have to build walls to keep people in." "And when you're born in prison, you don't know what to do with freedom." "No matter how shiny they make it." What, you in here jacking off? Reading bedtime stories? Nigga. -G, man. -I love you back. I love you, too, man. I told them niggas you was getting out, Cuz! Yeah. I heard Delano was hot as a motherfucker, man. You know how it is, Cuz. Man, that shit was inhumane, man. Ah, it don't matter.

[scoffs] Across state lines? It's very low-risk. [Gideon] Pops. Let me owe you a few dollars, until I get on my feet. [sighs] Gideon, can you lay low? Can you do that, huh? Yeah. Hey. Call me if you need me. Love you, nigga. Comfortable? Mm-hm. [sighs] I know this is fucked up. But I'm working on getting you out of here. And go to Victorville. I heard it's real safe out there. They got good schools. All right, go to sleep, OK? OK. Good night, Angel Boy. [engine revving] That's where your mama is. We'll go see her later. All right. [man] Hey, hey, hey, Bambi. Isaac. -I ain't seen you in a while. -Yeah, man. What's up? Just chillin' with a feelin', you know. Hey, word to the wise, though. There was a killing last night so, you know, you want to stay in and... stay inside as much as possible, and, you know, be safe. -All right. -I'll see you in the third. -All right. -Be good, man. -Yeah. -OK.

That's beautiful, man. Congrats. I got loans, grants. Nigga, man, I maxed them all out. I still need to come up with some money, though. What's up with the suit? -A nigga's got to look the part. -Oh. You know? [Bambi snorts] You seen mom? Kinda. She still a mess? I knew you'd get published, but a short story in McSweeney's, from jail? Now, that's next level, bro. -You gotta sign it for me. -For sure. I'm proud of you. Like real talk, man. Thank you. Listen, man. Um... Can me and Day stay here? What do you think? You gotta ask Gramps, but I doubt it. Look, man, I understand your predicament, but the housing authority doesn't allow any convicts or parolees on these premises. Just for a few days, till I get on my feet. No. What if they have an inspection? We all get caught, we all get kicked out. -It's not worth it, Bambi. -Man.

I've still got a couple of weeks to get it, so I'm not tripping... yet. I've been turning in my applications everywhere, man. -It's dry as hell. -[siren burst] [Bambi] Shit, man. Fucking Hernandez.

He's my brother, man. Why don't you do something like join the army? Get out of here. This bright kid's on his way to college. Well, come on, college boy. You can go. -What about my brother? -I said go. -Just stay chill. Be cool. -Yeah. [female officer] Get a booster seat for that kid. Don't let me catch you fucking up again. [stammers] I...

But, I mean, what good is it if you don't, you know, help out your family? You know what I'm saying? I'm more than happy to clean up around here. I'm trying to find a job so I can pitch in on the rent. [cutlery clatters] It's not that. I need some real help around here. No, nigga. Get your ass back over here. You're a grown-ass man. You wanna live here? You're gonna follow some fucking rules. -It's too rich for my blood, man. -I don't give a fucking shit, Nephew. It's either go to Portland... or fuck off. -I'm not running no non-profit here. -Come on, man. Hey, you know we don't have nowhere else to stay. I'm telling you.

[woman] Let's get a copy of your driver's license. I'm still in the process of getting that. Without you being able to drive, it's gonna be real hard to find you a job. -I can work here. -[laughs] I can clean the windows. I'd do anything. We don't have any positions. You gotta start with the license. But you should come back, use the computers. Things do open up. All right, thanks. Dad, horses! Cool! Come on, we gotta go to Gideon’s. OK. How do they expect me to get rehabilitated when they won't rehabilitate me in the first place? Man, you need to be writing. That's what you need to be doing. Use that to get Day up out of here. All I need is eight bucks an hour, some food, a place to stay. Then I can think about getting a computer and all of that. I got you, man. When you write about this, you make sure you keep it 100. Cos fuck all this. Running, hiding. I'm tired of it. Day, go find yourself five rocks. You all right? Them Brandy Heights niggas is after me. Nigga, everybody out there chilling, right? And out of nowhere, these niggas pull out heat, get to bustin'. I'm heated. What the fuck do you think I'm gonna do? I bust back! I hit a kid, Cuz. A fucking ten-year-old kid. Look at Day, man. Handsome. [Gideon] Day. Come here, man. -You got some rocks, Day? -Yeah. [PA] Now serving A051 at window number six. Your problem is you owe over 15 grand in child payment support. How does that make sense?! I only got $85. Mister, don't raise your voice at me, OK? How was I supposed to pay child support when I was in jail? I can't issue you a state driver's license if you don't pay this outstanding amount. -That's all. -Wait. I gotta get a job to pay child support. To get a job I have to have a driver's license, but to get a driver's license I still need to pay child support. -I'm confused by it as well. -Right. It's a messed-up system. There's a website that you can go to. Wi-Fi this and Wi-Fi... Look, I don't have a computer, man. You're gonna have to help me out on this. Well, why don't you go to Social Services and tell them about it? You can get your child support payments either reduced or annulled over there. My baby mama didn't file for no child support. She didn't file for it. She's on AFDC. The county files child support for her. So you can't give me my driver's license? No, sir, I cannot. All right. Thank you. Come on, let's go. [Gideon] I got your laptop. [engine revving] Hey! Hey, G! Hey, G, get the fuck out of here, Cuz! Brandy niggas are coming in the car, man! Hey, come on, man! Niggas in the car! Hey, come on! Leave that shit! [engine revving] [tires squealing] Come on, Son. [gunshot] [gunshot] [gunshot] [gunshot] [engine revving] [gang member] Go, go, go! -[doors slamming] -[engine revving] G. G. G. [siren approaching] Come on, D, man. [distant siren blares] -It's gonna be OK. -OK. [gasps] [mutters] Fuck both those niggas, man. Fuck both those niggas. My fucking nigga, man. [whimpers] [sighs] He OK from last night? I don't know. Oh, Deacon. This is my brother, Bambi. Oh, blessings, brother. I'm guessing you two aren't twins. -[laughs] -We have different fathers. Well, take some food home. We've got plenty of leftovers. Yeah, thanks. Oh, uh... Deacon, can I ask you something? Is there any way you can give my brother some hours? He's a hard worker, sir. I'd love to help, but we're just not getting enough events lately. [Wayne] OK, thanks. But if anything changes, just let us know. At least, man, we'll go to Uncle Shrimp's and we'll pay our last respects. All right? I was thinking. When this all blows over, do you think it's cool if we ask Shrimp for a loan? He's gonna want something in return. We could split the money, man. We ain't doing it. [siren burst] [soul music playing over stereo] [chattering] -I love you. -Don't go. Look, you're cool here. -Love you. -I love you, too. [knocking] [Shrimp sniffs] Are you all right? [Shrimp] I should have told Gideon... [sniffs] ...how hot these motherfuckers are when they hit you. You know, that's the real pain. [sniffs] The heat... when they inside you. That burn. [sniffs] Fuck this, man. Let's go get these motherfuckers. [breathes deep and exhales] Yeah. Nigga, what did you do? Did you go soft in jail? It's just not me no more. It's not me, loved one. [sniffs] Right. [gun chamber spins] [loading bullets] [engine revving] -[gunshots] -[tires squealing] -[screams] -Hey! Hey. Shh. Shh. Shh. Shh. It's OK. It's OK. I got you. I got you. I got you. [screaming continues] Day. Day, I got you, man. I got you. It's OK. It's OK. Shh. Shh. You call your son Angel Boy... cos in the bricks, the softer the name, the harder the man. But Gideon was hard. You were hard. And your daddy was hard. And look at us. Deceased, derelict, departed. And you swear... Angel Boy won't end up a savage. Dead, smiling on a T-shirt. He won't work the corner. He won't work the curb. He won't want to be the emperor under this dark Imperial highway. Because monarchs are not elected around here. They're made with a gun. And they reign only until it rains... all over. [Wayne] I was reading up on self-publishing, right? Maybe we could convince one of these big Baptist churches to back you. Give you some up-front money for speaking engagements or something. Man, I'm sleeping in a car with my kid. I need an apartment first. Bro, we need something, man. Man, get a credit card or something. -Man, I tried. -Try harder. They denied me. Look, for now, will you just look after Day for a few hours? I gotta go downtown. I have some business. Book business. All right. Can I help you? Yeah. Is there anybody I can slip some pages to? Oh, we can't accept unsolicited materials. I got printed in McSweeney's, page 44. You should check that out. Uh... It's loosely based on my life. My parents weren't around, so I was raised by killers and thugs at my uncle's house. Crazy, right? When did you start writing? I taught myself while I was in jail. I've been in and out since I was 12. I had to write to stay sane. OK. Um... Look, I can't promise you anything, but um... leave your pages and make sure you keep your contact info on them and I'll see what I can do. The e-mail's good, right? -Sure. -Yeah, I got it in there. -Here's the office info. -All right. Thank you. Janine. You got a sister's name. You part black? Thank you, Janine. [Wayne] Here he comes, ma'am. Are you Daytone's father? Yeah. What's going on. I'm Miss Price from Child and Family Services. I was called out on a parental-negligence case. Your son was outside alone and cut his arm pretty badly. The police had no idea who to call. -[Bambi] Are you OK? -Yeah. I hope his being unsupervised isn't normal. No, ma'am. Well, I have to file an official warning. I take it this is where you live? Yeah. Well, call me. We have resources if you need any help. Thank you. I'll make sure he's properly supervised, I promise. Good. I'll be checking on you. Yeah. [mutters] Yo, my bad, Bro. I-I was on the phone. He was outside playing. All of a sudden, that Social Services lady just showed up. What was you thinking, man? This is the last thing I need right now! They give these warnings out to scare people. Wayne, you fucked up, man! Relax, Bro. Relax?! That's my son! I was trying to help you out, dumbass. Get the fuck out of here, man! Man, you get the fuck out! This is my place! You just don't get it. You think cos you wear a tie it's all good? So I should worry about what you think? Nigga, go back to your car. I got a home. Oh, OK. -I ain't fuckin' with you. -You ain't gotta fuck with me. Yeah, best believe that. Come on. Come on, man. Come on. Come on. [Bambi] Sit back. [Day hums] Will you stop? Stop. Stop. [Day continues humming] Hey. Stop. [Day continues humming] Hey. Hey. -Hey. -[humming stops] What do you want? What do you want? Cos you gotta figure that out. Now, sit your ass down. Come on. [Day's mom] All this shit is getting on my goddamn nerves. [Bambi] What? Being in here. Yeah. There's not shit to do. What happened to his arm? Oh, he got into some next type of shit. What do you mean? You ain't watching him? What you been doing? It's just a cut. He's good. You fucking them ratchet bitches? -What the fuck is wrong with you? -What the fuck is wrong with me? -What's wrong with you? -Are you OK? -Why are you changing the subject? -I didn't come here to fight, OK? All right. You see that kiddie pool? -She saw the pool. -[Day] Yeah? [giggles] They're releasing non-violent offenders in a couple of months. I ain't holding my breath. I'm running out of options out here. What's that mean? Sometimes a nigga just has to do some shit. You know what I mean? Let's go. What's up, Cuz? What's good with you? Shit, chillin'. Smokin' on this motherfuckin' weed, man. What you got goin' on, nigga? -What you got poppin'? -Hm? What you got poppin'? You up to something. I ain't up to nothing. Good to see your ass. I ain't seen you in a minute. Oh. Let me hit that, man, real quick. All the time. [Fat Rat] The fuck is that? Nigga, that's Gideon's gun, right? So? [scoffs] So? Probably got a couple of young bodies on it. I ain't fuckin' with you, nigga. You loaded as a motherfucker. All right, loved one. It's cool. You should go in the back, nigga. You trippin'. You need to toss that motherfucker in the river. [men chattering] [Shrimp] Thank you for sending your brother over here. He been sitting here telling me how interested he is in doing some driving for me. Go to the bathroom. Go wash your face and your hands. OK. I don't know why he's here, dog. If you need somebody to drive, it shouldn't be him. This nigga ain't built for this line of work. -Chill out, man. -Man, you out. Both of y'all, shut the fuck up. I run this. -He's a civilian, man. -He's a grown-ass man is what he is. Go put on that suit. Come right back. I appreciate you. You think you hard? You ain't hard, Cuz. [mutters] Bambi. On some real shit. You'd rather live in that car... [scoffs] ...than help me. It's not that, man. I just... I need a regular job. [sighs] Can you hook me up? Now you think you can just come in here and ask for favors any time you please? You know what? Homey, you hang around. All right? Clean up the place. And while you at it, clean yourself up. OK? Here. You're looking homeless. [scrubbing] [door opening] You went against my word, man. Man, get the fuck out of my face, man. [Bambi] Want some? Huh?! [Fat Rat] Hold up! Watch out! Watch out! What y'all doing?! -You lucky I don't fuck you up! -[Fat Rat] Chill! Yeah, that's the real Bambi I know. -You ain't know. -It's my business. Stay the fuck out of it. I know you niggas better not be in here breaking up my shit. You're talking all that bullshit, and this is what you teach him? -[Wayne] It's cool, it's cool. -Yeah. That's cool.

Out of all the niggas in the hood, y'all pick on the nigga trying to do the right thing. Come on! Y'all niggas are supposed to help me. She took my son, man! Fuck! Throw his ass out to me, Hernandez. What were you thinking? Free to go. That car of yours looks pretty lived in. It's not the best place for a kid. [distant rap music and chattering] Is Tanya here? -What's up, man? -Is Tanya here? Yeah, she's here. [rap music blares] [woman humming] What you doing? Protecting him. -Are you OK? -Yes. -Are you hurt? -No. [Tanya sobs] Are you OK? Get yourself cleaned up, Ma. OK. [gun cocking] Close the door. -Uncle-- -Yeah, I know. I raised your black ass. How dare you... hit me in my face... and hold a gun to my fucking head? I ought to blow your fucking head off right now. Then what, loved one? Huh? What about Day? You know what, nigga? There are reasons... why we are... the way we are. So, what, nigga? I'm the bad guy in this story? Just keeping it real. I had to raise you to be a soldier... cos that's the only way you was gonna make it out here. Respect. But I gotta go my own way. Why are you so motherfucking hard-headed? Yeah. [chuckles] Hey. In the hood, you carry truth in your heart... while reality stays stashed outside. Your heart says, "Don't kill." The hood says, "Kill." Your heart says, "Think before you act." The hood says, "React." But you're all alone when one of those reactions lands you behind bars, going over every little thing in the darkness. And it's easy to recognize your truth in retrospect. What's hard... is being true in the moment. Even if it kills you. [mouse clicking] [chatters] Come on, get down. Give me ten. All right? -Yeah. -Go down from ten. One, two... [Day grunts] [laughs] Oh, damn! You know how he's gonna do when he's 18, man. You gonna be a beast! You good. You good. You good. You good, Day. -OK. -Yeah. Good work. Why are you so happy, man? -That Janine girl. -Yeah? Sent my stuff to some agents, man. Yeah. -I got a shot. -[laughs] -Beautiful, Bro. -It's crazy. Crazy. [vehicle pulling up] Bambi. Hey, man, we gotta talk. What now? Remember Miss Price? From Child and Family Services. Mr. Jones, can we have a moment? You lied to us. We know you don't live in these projects. We've got evidence of you breaking our policy by allowing Day to be in several unsafe situations. Hi, Day. You remember me? Where do you sleep at night? OK. Being homeless doesn't help your case. Unfortunately, I'm gonna have to remove your son from your custody. [stammers] I can take care of him. Mr. Jones, Day needs to be in a stable environment right now. Take these. -Uh... I've got some relatives. -Then we can meet. -I have relatives. -Then we can meet. We have family. Are y'all really gonna do this now? Are you really gonna fucking do this now?! -He can stay with my grandfather. -Fuck! Day, come on, baby. -You see this?! -This is bullshit. -He's gotta go. -Y'all are doing this? He's gotta go. I know you hate this. I know you hate this, but maybe it's best for you if you're alone. OK, I got you. Miss Price? I just want you to know, I would do anything for my son. What do you need me to do? What do I have to do for my son? Let's just keep in close contact about your relative taking custody, OK? Because that is an option. But right now, he has to come with me. All right. I... I just need a moment with my son. Just a moment, all right? Go ahead. God damn. Hey. Hey, man. Um... Um... Dad ain't gonna see you for a while, all right? OK. But I... I'm gonna visit you, OK? Yeah. All right. Be a man. Read them books, all right? I'm gonna see you real soon. OK? [sighs] I love you, man. I love you, too. Man... -You're good? -Yeah. -Yeah? -Yeah. All right. Come on, Day. You'll get him back. -Yeah. -Huh? Yeah. You'll get him back. You'll get him back. -[whimpers] -You'll get him back. Fuck. Hernandez, you see this, man? You see this, man? -Is this what you wanted, man? -It's not what I want. Come on. Come on. Wait. Why don't you get in? Imagine this. You half wake up. Take a breath. Smile. It feels good. You go to swing your legs off the bed. Then you realize... they're gone. The pain is physical. That's what it feels like... when you lose your kid. An old lifer once told you... "All men suffer loss." But you know now that not all losses are the same. Only the ones that stop you from ever fighting again make you a loser. Make you go back to what's easy. What you know. Do you get Day this weekend? Yeah, I get to take him out Monday morning. Wanna roll with us? Yeah, love to. [Wayne] Can you believe I'm leaving for DC next Tuesday? Living in dorms. All the other losses just serve to strengthen you. Prepare you for what's ahead. -[Wayne] Is this where he lives? -Yeah, he's in that second building. And you're just thankful that Angel Boy inherited your fighting spirit... to help him navigate his foster forest. And though this loss is devastating... you know... that in time... you'll both be baptized as winners. ♪ We may not have ♪ ♪ A decent home to call our own ♪ ♪ And we may not ♪ ♪ Oh, no ♪ ♪ Be remembered when we're gone ♪ ♪ But we have ♪ ♪ We have ♪ ♪ Listen ♪ ♪ We have ♪ ♪ To call our own, own, own ♪ ♪ And every time ♪ ♪ Oh, yeah ♪ ♪ We can't hurt to see our way ♪ ♪ But just remember ♪ ♪ Always remember, baby ♪ ♪ That tomorrow is another day ♪ ♪ But we have ♪ ♪ We have ♪ ♪ There's no doubt about it, baby ♪ ♪ We have ♪ ♪ To call our own, own, own ♪ ♪ Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, yeah ♪ ♪ Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, yeah ♪ ♪ There may be time ♪ ♪ When we feel like we'll have to cry ♪ ♪ But just remember ♪ ♪ Always remember, baby ♪ ♪ We can make it if we try ♪ ♪ For we have ♪ ♪ We have ♪ ♪ Listen, baby ♪ ♪ We have ♪ ♪ To call our own, own, own ♪ ♪ To call our own, own, own ♪ ♪ To call our own, own, own ♪ ♪ To call our own, own ♪
