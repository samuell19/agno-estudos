Oh, definitely. I mean, have, have you talked to them? Have you heard them talk about you? -So you've talked to them? -They're in love with you. -Here they are. -Hey, guys, sorry we're late. -How you doing? -[greetings continue] Oh, we're very late. Sorry, guys. Lot of meetings. -Pilot season, right? -[man 2] That's it. Well, at least you got two shows that you know you already love, right? -Yeah. -[laughter] All right, I know you guys are busy. I will get right to it. It needs to be Emmy time. Always. Second season, I go de Niro. Okay, I'll give you one more hint. Rag-- Raging Bull. I come back, season two, I'm 60 pounds fat. -[laughter] -I'm 60-- I've gained-- [laughs] I didn't know where he was going with this. Not a fat suit. You don't win a fucking Emmy in a fat suit. -[laughter] -You win an Emmy how? You get, you get, you get fat. Now, I'm already 20 pounds into it, as you can see. Look, I didn't want to say anything, but it was a little, a little in the face, a little bit, yeah. No one will see that coming, right? I love it. We love the show and love you. Mmm-hmm, mmm-hmm. And it's Rogenesque, really, man, phenomenal. Thank you. Thank you very much. -It's Apatow funny. -Thank you. -I really appreciate that. -And we're so ecstatic to have you on our network, and we feel so lucky to have you in our lives. And, and not just as colleagues. I say that as a friend, dude. Oh, thanks, man. I-- I feel the same way. You guys are great. You're-- it's been such a joy to work with you. -I really, I really-- -But, unfortunately, we're canceling your show. [chuckles] Well, we can only bring one show back, and it's gonna be The Two Knuckleheads. -[man] Yeah, so... -You guys, seriously? Can I tell you? You guys are so funny. We should really have you on the show. I know you like to usually stay behind the corporate veil or whatever, but you should-- you should do, like, a cameo on the show. Listen, good luck. Wait, you guys-- you guys aren't serious? -Well... -[both] Yeah. I have nothing against Knuckleheads. I think it's a really good show. I think we work really well together. But, but, but... I mean, my old partner and I invented that whole bromance genre. I mean, we were doing that same thing they're doing years ago. Well, maybe if you'd done a little more of that now, someone would have watched this show. -So, you know... [laughs] -Well, can we, do you want-- Is it a conversation? Can you-- Do you want to hear the-- We can change up the-- It really can't be. It really can't be. You know, we-- It's all in the numbers. -[man] Sure. -Call me about Jim, okay? Oh, yeah, will do. Great. -Okay. -But you know what? If, um, you guys need your parking validated, talk to Theresa, she'll hit you up. It won't be a problem. She'll fix you right up. -Yeah. Great to see you. -All right. See you around. -Wow. -What the fuck just happened? You, you, you told me you just talked to them, and they-- they loved me and they love the show. Oh, they do. They love you a lot. And who the fuck is Jim? Jim, hoo. Very promising young talent. Comedian. Senior in high school. Very fit. Anyway, tough day. [♪] Well, I-- I can't even believe you're saying this. -I need to move on. -I thought we were moving on, -together. -No, Jason, I'm sorry, but I think it's best if we move on separately. Okay, well, are you open to discussing it? Uh, no. [scoffs] I can't discuss it anymore. Well, which part will you discuss? Okay, "no" is a complete sentence. Okay, so is "I don't want to break up." I need you to have your things out by tomorrow. But I have to finish my book. See, this isn't easy for me. You know, we've been going around and round this for, like, two years. And the gulf of intimacy that you are using-- this book-- to create is getting wider and wider. We don't have sex anymore. You don't talk to me anymore. And the one date night that you agreed to have, um, back before you said couples counseling had cured us, has devolved from its all-time high of a diner dinner and a Netflix movie to you rubbing one of my feet for five minutes while you watch SportsCenter. But you said you liked SportsCenter. You're packed. [man] Dude, that was such fucking bullshit! Set up some more pitches! I'll have another fucking show by midnight! [man 2] Yeah, I don't think so. Okay, well, I better, because I'm broke, okay? And I already fucking gained 20 pounds for this fucking shit. At least get me on some, you know, B-celebrity lose-fat reality show or something. What happened to all the money from the first season? I was so in debt, that just got me even. I was counting on the million for season two. -I don't have a dime. -Come on, bro. You know you would have gone back to New York and blown that on another one of your weird vanity sex movies, just so you can make out with supermodels, all right? You always said you loved my movies. Yeah, it used to be company policy with you. But we've re-evaluated. C.C.A. is dropping you. Dude, I fought for you. Hard. But no one wants to work with you anymore. Let's face some facts: you're old, you're kind of fat, and you're still-- honestly, you're clinging to this idea that anyone wants to see some avant-garde, small, charactery, talky, 90-minute film anymore. I got one word of advice for you: webisode. It's the new independent film. You make me a 90-second solid piece of entertainment, throw in some nice product placement, I am right back on the Splick Featherstone express train. Okay? Cool. [scoffs] Okay. What are you even talking about? Commercials? Mm-mm, no. Feature. 90 seconds. You're back in the business. I love you, okay, you know that? Jim. I got great news! You sitting down? [man speaking Russian] Why can't I have my old room back? Because Latchkaya lives in it. [speaking Russian] -Hello, Jeffrey! -[woman] Jason. It's Jason. Hello, Jason! Welcome to our house! My niece loves your movie. Thanks, but that was a very long time ago. She wrote letter to you. Here. She is very pretty. And sex! You single and lonely now. Read the letter and call her. She is emotion, and cook you good! Yeah, I'm sure she'll emotion and cook me good, Latchkaya. Thanks. But it's my childhood room. Mine's here. Yours is over there. Yes, where Christie and I sleep. Okay, I enjoy Latchkaya. He's an excellent human. But can't he go live somewhere else? He's my husband. Yes, but only for $10,000 and a green card. That's all done now, so off he goes with his hot-dog cart, and I get my room back. So we rigged this curtain for you here. And thanks, you guys, for letting me stay here for a while, I really appreciate it. [groans] It shouldn't be for long. I'll be killing myself any day now, anyway, so... Honey, don't say that. No. [♪] [♪] Hey, Sanchez. Hola, chico! You're back? No, no. I'm just visiting my mom for a couple days, you know. Until my-- till my show starts up again. The one with your friend, Jason? That was great. No. No, no, that was a movie. That's a movie that I made a long time ago. I'm talking about my show. I Love Cake? I Love Cake? The-- The one where I'm obsessed with cake, you know, and I'm eating cake everywhere, and "I love cake"? I didn't like that one. I liked the movie with your friend from before. -Come in, honey. -Hi, Mama. Hey. Oh. We were just watching The Two Knuckleheads. -[laughs] It's so funny. -[man] We love it. -Don't you love it? -Yeah, I do love it. I love that show very, very much. Hey, you're welcome to stay with us, but wouldn't you rather stay at a hotel? Honey, don't say that. So, um, when's the second season start? Um, soon. Soon. It's just a little up in the air timing-wise. It's, just, you know, the network politics of... scheduling stuff, you know. -That's, that's heavy. -That's wonderful. -But, soon. Soon. -Okay, then. Is this-- should we-- Should we talk about this? -It's secret, so you probably don't want to talk about it at all. -[man] It's in flux. -[mother] We won't. And don't write on the internet about it or anything. [man laughs] Any of your blogs or anything. No, I'm serious, because it's-- we want to keep it-- -[man] Okay. -Tight, quiet. -[quietly] I might have. -Okay? It's so fun. You come to live with us every 10 years or so. I remember 10 years ago, I'd just married your mom. You moved in. You'd just made the movie with Jason. And here it is 10 years later, and you're back. And you got a hit show again! I gotta tell you, as much as I love I Love Cake, and I do, I love it, I love I Love Cake. But-- And I love the other movies, I love them. But, for my money, the best thing you ever did was My Life's In Turnaround. Whatever happened to Jason? It's sad you guys aren't friends anymore. [♪] Listen, you can't sit around here all day for free, okay? It's not a public library. Just order a lousy tea or something. Well, what about that guy? Yeah. He ordered a tea. [♪] [Jason] Hey, how you doing, man? -[man] Hi, how are you? -[Jason] Good. What can I get for this? -[man] Um, does it work? -[Jason] Yeah. I'll give you 50. Okay. -Hey, how much is that? -Um, 45. -Does it work? -Sure, it works pretty good. I'll take it. [typewriter keys clacking] Listen, boss, I'm sorry. You got to go. What? I bought the tea. [♪] [grunts] [grunts] [cell phone rings] -Hello? -Jason! -Splick? -Yeah, what's up? Jason? [cell phone rings] -Hello? -Hey, we got disconnected. Yeah, 'cause I hung up on you. [cell phone rings] Hello? -What the fuck is wrong with you? -Everything. Okay, well, I'm sorry about that, but we have important meetings to take. I can't take any more meetings with you. -Why would you say that? -We haven't spoken in many years, and if you remember correctly, there's a good reason for that. Okay, just stop being a baby. Take my meeting on the bench in Riverside Park right now. [♪] Why is it like fucking pulling teeth to get a meeting with you? All due respect, my last recollection of a meeting with you wasn't very good. -What part of the meeting? -Uh, the part where you tried to sue me in civil court, claiming rights to my personage, likeness, thoughts, for theft of intellectual property, copyright infringement, and for any and all ideas we had together throughout the universe in perpetuity. -Yeah, but I let you keep video. -Actually, you didn't. -Okay, well... -Well, it wasn't very pleasant. Yeah, well, neither was the Holocaust, okay? It doesn't mean Germans and Jews can't be friends. You know, at a certain point, you kind of get over it. Huh. So people should just get over the Holocaust? No, come on, that's not what I mean. You know what I'm talking about. Look, I'm sorry for my part in all the bullshit that happened between us, okay? I was young, I didn't know how to play with other children as well as I do now, okay? I'm truly sorry. But the simple fact is more people enjoyed us from that movie we made together than all of our personal movies and private shows by ourselves since. Nobody cares about that movie. What are you talking about? People love that movie. -Yeah, 200 people, maybe. -Well, guess what? We have to make a whole 'nother new one right now. You were just fired from the "Splick is old and fat" show. You really think people want to watch the "Splick is old and fat" movie? Oh, thanks. Well, you think they want to watch the "Jason gets kicked out by his girlfriend for the millionth time, moves home with his gay sister, her lover, and their Lithuanian green card husband, throws the long-lost dream novel in the ocean" book? How did you know all that? Come on, man. It's written all over your face. And, you know, it's in the trades. Bullshit. Nobody keeps track of me in the trades. There are fan websites devoted to us, in love with us from that first movie, that tracks our every fucking moves. Okay, did you know, last year, My Life's In Turnaround was the fifth-most popular movie in Trinidad and Tobago? No, yeah, right. See, you did not know that. Okay, the Antichrist must rise once again. As, you know, as whatever the good opposite... of Antichrists are. Okay, well, I think I must rise now from this meeting and "disobtain" you. -Why do you say that? -Because I have another meeting, and as I anticipate it, it will absolutely have to be better than this one. What, the meeting at the Coinstar machine at the supermarket? No, that's tomorrow. I have a meeting at the gym. Oh, I'll take your gym meeting. -No. -Why not? Because I have concern about having you around me. Okay, well, guess what, it's a free country, and if I want to ride on the ellipticals and walk on all the fucking gyroscopes, then I'll do that myself. [talking indistinctly] [♪] -Have a good workout, Jason. -Thanks. Have a good workout, self. Self? What's that? Let me see it. -"Self indulgent"? -Yeah. Besides trying to gain 60 pounds for the second season of my show, I legally changed my name to Self Indulgent as a publicity stunt, you know, to poke fun at all the fucking assholes who say that I'm full of myself. No, that was definitely a good idea. Very, very smart marketing strategy, Self. That's Mr. Indulgent to you. So, don't call me that anymore anyway 'cause I'm changing it back. [♪] [♪] You know, is it just me, or do you find yourself as you get older a little more attracted to the kind of bigger, rounder-- Fat chicks! Yes, what is that? I don't know. They're just so soft, and you want to melt into them, be absorbed by them. Listen, for thousands of years, until that Twiggy came along 40 years ago, that was considered a proper girl. She had a place to put all the babies on her hips and-- Yeah, and they can nurture and feed that baby all through many months of famine. And, you know, that's-- and that's what the man animal wanted, man, like, just that strong, sturdy, solid-- Fucking fat girl. Man, that fat girl that God made us to want to have that fat girls on us, on our dick, and put it in there. But I like them to have a pretty face, though. Oh, yeah, definitely, yeah. Yeah, like, that girl was really pretty. -Oh, no, she was. -Yeah. -But what is the face, really? -What do you mean? It's really just the area where all the sensory apparatus -are gathered. -Right. I mean, it's just really like an information panel. -Right. -Now, why is the shape of the information panel so important? -Yeah, totally. -Yeah. -It shouldn't be important. -It's not important. Informational fucking panel. But you're not saying you like them to be ugly in the face, though. -Oh, no. -No, no, right. -Ow, fuck, man. -What? That was ten? -No, four. -No pain, no gain, man. Please, that's a widely held misnomer, man. Pain is the way the body tells you to run away from a fucking lion -who's trying to eat you. -No, that's fear. And therefore, pain tells you to run away from an exercise if it's dangerous, okay? Everybody knows that. All right, well, if you're not even gonna work out properly, -I don't know what to say. -Well, that's what I'm trying to say: I came, I worked out, I did it. What do you want me to do? Why didn't you tell me my shorts were on backwards? I knew something looked weird, but I thought it was your shirt. -I'm dyslexic. -Now, wait a minute. Is this one of those things where I can turn this around without having to take it off, or... No, no, no, no, no. You're getting that confused with when girls take off their bra through one arm sleeve without taking their shirt off. -You can't do that with that. -Right. It turns me on when girls do that. I don't know why. Makes me wanna fuck their tits. All right, well, I got to go do my hour of cardio, so... Oh, you're gonna do an hour of cardio? -Yeah. -That's perfect, 'cause I do a 60-minute ab series every day. so I'll do that and I'll meet you in the sauna in an hour. Yeah, one hour. 4:00, I'll see you in the sauna. 4:00 sharp. All right. I'll see you. [♪] Why won't you be in the movie? Look, man, I appreciate your crazy, dogmatic, unrelenting ambition, I truly do. But I don't know, you know? Like, I just think there comes a time in life where you just got to, like, accept that what you've been doing isn't working, you know, and just try something different. We're not kids anymore, you know? It's getting a little scary. Yeah, okay, so what are you gonna do? I don't know, just do what every other fuckin' pre-middle-aged, washed-up artist does. [scoffs] Come on, you can't go to law school. -Why not? -[Scoffs] Please, Jason. You didn't-- Anyway, you didn't even graduate college. Oh, whatever, I'm four credits short. You know, I'll just take some one-night-a-week home-from-internet course and finish it all up. Why is it so hot in this room? ♪ All these faces ♪ They'll be saying goodbye ♪ Goodbye ♪ Don't make me say it ♪ Don't make me say it ♪ I can't face this ♪ I can't say it ♪ Goodbye, goodbye ♪ [woman] And then they need to-- to get that check, and you can't be worried about that, because you're-- let me call you back. Hey, guys. can I help you? Hey, how are you? Uh, I went here a few years ago. I don't know '88, '89. Might have been the '90s. Anyway, I'm four credits short of my degree, and I need to get that cleared up, so I can go to law school. So, I don't know, maybe you can help find my transcript or whatever. Okay, let me go take a look at your records, mister... Little. Jason Little. Little. Okay, very good. Just a moment. Isn't it funny how you come back to your old school and everything looks really small? No, that's-- that's grade school. Oh, right, right, right. But what's college? Being brought back to life from a heroin overdose by the lips of your fat Jewish roommate, Paul. Oh, right. Excuse me, ma'am. Can I just check something real quick on your computer? -Excuse me? -I just need to come back there real quick and-- and-- and check something out. I'm sorry, no one's really allowed back here. It'll just take a second. It's just really important. -Can I? -All right. Thank you so much. Thanks so much. Just really quick. I just had to check something. What are you doing? I need to see who viewed me. What's that? Um... my new girlfriends. It's a website where I can find my new girlfriends. So, what, you just troll through here and you just buy whoever you want? Yeah, it's fucking genius. Well, I can't be involved with any of your internet whoring. Well, they're not whores. They're proper girls. They're proper girlfriends that if-- that if you choose them and they choose you, they can be your real girlfriends. Really? So these are just regular girls you can obtain as your proper girlfriend? Yeah, it's crazy. Well, yeah. I mean, so, I write a lot of them. I write the ones I like. And most of them "disobtain" me. But some of them enjoy me, and then we go out. Yeah. And then you freak them out in person and they "disobtain" you to your face. -Exactly, which I enjoy. -No, you have to have that. Yeah. So-- So who viewed you, or whatever? Who viewed me? This girl viewed me. This girl. Filmmaker chick. -She's hot. -Yeah. So, she wants to go out with you? I don't know, I don't know. She might want to. I don't know, I'm waiting. See, I viewed her. I wrote her. She viewed me back, but she hasn't written me back yet. Which either means that she hates me or that she's formulating a note to write me back. Which I don't love, because I would have rather that right when she re-viewed me, she wrote me back after she got my letter. But I'll give her the benefit of the doubt for a couple hours. If she doesn't write me back by tonight, though, I'll still give her one more chance, and maybe she's shy or something, and I'll write her back and ask her to talk to me on the phone, which is the next phase. Right, well, that sounds very complicated. No, it's very easy. You just have to learn all the rules. You know what I'll do? To get you started, I'll sell you one of my "disobtained" ones. No, no, no. I can't be dating anyone right now. I'm not in any condition or shape emotionally or mentally to be attempting any relationship-- Who's that? Yeah, that's what I'm trying to tell you. She's fuckin' hot. -"Ringgirl"? -Yeah, she's-- she's a ring girl, so she walks around in those death-combat cage matches and holds up the cards in between rounds. And she's also studying molecular biology at Princeton. Maybe I'll obtain her. Where do I click or whatever? Well, you have a couple options. You can-- You can wink at her, which girls think is pathetic, so you shouldn't do that. Girls can wink at us, 'cause they're girls, they can do whatever they want. But they don't like it if you wink at them, 'cause it's not showing enough interest. You can hot-list her, which is one step up from a wink. That they kind of accept. They don't love it, but you can get away with that. So you can either wink at her, hot-list her, you can view her again, hope she re-views you-- Okay can I just write her an e-mail? Oh, yeah, you can do that. Yeah, just write her. Go ahead. That's an excellent move. Yeah, write her an e-mail. Click there and just write her a letter. What are you gonna say? I'm gonna say I think she's really interesting and hot and I would like to go on a date with her, I guess. Um... you winked me. -I did? -Yeah. -Did you view me? -Yeah. [woman] Okay, Mr. Little. Uh, wow. What-- What are they doing back there? Sorry. She was nice enough to let us do an e-mail. -It's not her fault. -Yeah. Mr. Little, I did actually find you. -Uh, fall semester, 1989. -'89? Oh, yeah, I thought it was the '80s, yeah. Uh, anyway, um, can you just tell me what course, maybe, I should take to get my degree the fastest? Well, I'm afraid we don't actually have a 60-credit course. No, no, I need four credits to graduate. Sixty-four credits are required for graduation. -Yeah, yeah, and I have 60. -No. No, Mr. Little, actually, you have four. Registrar humor. I knew there was a four involved. [Jason] Fucking four credits. No, you can't worry about how many credits. Six, four, it doesn't matter, because this is divine intervention. We're not meant to go to any law school, we're meant to make our next movie. Okay, nobody's giving us any money to make a movie. Why are you so fucking opposed to claiming our destiny, Jason? Okay, I don't have any money. My destiny is to get a job. Okay, we have a job. Our job is movie stars. You want to stop saying that? Seriously, that's fucking over for us now, okay? That's over for us. We had our little moment years ago. Cool little movie, you know, with the agents flying around to take our meetings everywhere. But when we reached that pivotal fulcrum where you either skyrocket or you spiral down-- Yeah, we skyrocketed. No, we did not skyrocket, all right? And in our business, there's no second chances when you're, you know, us, now. No second chances? I have one word for you, my friend. F. Murray Abraham. Okay? That guy was, like, some obscure acting teacher in Brooklyn till he's, like, fucking 65. He wins the Academy Award for Amadeus, now he's hosting Saturday Night Live. No, you think he was 65 because you're remembering him with your 25-year-old brain from way back then. The truth is the guy was probably just-- Whatever, our age. Yeah, exactly! That's my point! Okay, one guy. Brian Dennehy. Okay, that guy was, like, some obscure dock worker in the merchant marines or some shit, well into his 70s, okay? Now what? Now he's cast as the strong, virile, tough guy in Friday Night Lights, biggest show in television history. The guy's not even in that. Fucking Cocoon, man. I'll "cocoon" you! That old, gay English wizard from Harry Potter? -You can't say that. -No, you can't say that one. -That lady from Titanic. -Don't say anything. Just, seriously, do not say it. -With the diamond. -Stop saying it. Rose. We're done, aren't we? [exhales sharply] [♪] Hi. Uh, do you mind if I use your computer in my-- your room? [cell phone rings] -What's up? -She wrote me back. -Who did? -"Ringgirl." -Get the fuck out of here! -Yeah, what do I do now? I don't know. Fuck, I can only get viewed by 56-year-old Barbara Stanwyckian golfers from Rancho Mirage. She wants me to come to her match tonight. Oh, wait, wait. "Filmmakerchick" just re-viewed me. Let me send you her profile. Hold on. Did you get it? Hold on. Okay. Likes snowboarding. Spicy food. Hates people who say they don't watch reality TV. Agnostic. Well, whatever. Maybe wants children. "Who I want: someone who will open doors for me and also tie me up and throw me down." -Excellent. -Great. All right, I have to get ready for my date. -What time do we go to that war? -It's a date. I go on that myself. No, come on, maybe I'll get a "Ringgirl," too. You have your filmmaker and Midwestern grandmother. They only re-viewed me. They didn't write me back. -I have to go to that with you. -[sighs] [announcer] In the blue corner, Jimmy "A-Team" Rivera! [bell dings] [audience shouts indistinctly] I could beat that guy. I could beat them both at once. -[heavy thud] -Oh, man! [splat] -Maybe-- Maybe not that guy. -Yeah, maybe not. [bell dings] -[announcer] Jimmy! -What? [cheering, applause] [announcer] How about some love for one of our lovely round girls? There she is. -What, not the girl now? -Yeah, that's her. [cheering, whistling] -Are you sure? -Yes. [bell dings] That girl is totally hot. [indistinct shouting] So, I really liked your profile. Uh, thanks. Yeah, it was my first one, so-- Ohh, how sweet, a virgin. I broke your cherry. Yeah, I guess you could say that. So, um, what do people do now, usually? I don't know, I thought maybe we could just go back to our place tonight? Oh, you have a roommate or... A little more than a roommate. -Oh. -Yeah, Dana and I have been together for about three years now. We're just looking for the right person to fill out our little triangle. Okay. You saw that I put "attached" on my profile, right? You know, I didn't see that, but I'm new, so, you know, I just might have missed that. -Is it a problem? -No, it's not a problem. Um, you know, I actually was looking for something more of like an actual relationship, you know, not only a sex thing. Oh, no, no, so-- so do we. That's why I didn't put "play". I listed "serious relationship". Huh. Well, I'm-- I'm definitely open. You know, I'm, you know, interested for sure. Okay, I mean, we realize it's non-traditional, but hey, traditional hasn't seemed to work for many people, so... Hey, I mean, who knows if we're even meant to fit into any kind of preordained relationship structure, right? I mean, it's not like it really pans out, so... I don't know, maybe try something new, right? Exactly our thought. Hey, babe. I'm Dana. You must be Jason. I'm gonna just go rip this guy's nuts off, and then we'll all, uh, you know, go for drinks, eh? [audience cheers] I'm done with all that. Well, it was kind of your fault for not thoroughly reading her profile. Okay, I don't want to date a profile. I want to date actual people, one person. One person, one girl, actually. -Come on. -What? We have to go to my date now. No, I'm done dating. I'm going home. Dude, come on. We have to go-- We went on your date. We have to go on mine. That "filmmakerchick" wrote me back, and she-- and she wants me to go visit her on-- on the-- on the set of her film. Okay, that's the last place I want to go. She said she makes porn. Really? Where does she make all that? Listen, but here's what I realized, Jason. What if it's not really porn? What if it's... What if it's a snuff film? Dude, they make them still. And they have to find people to kill somehow. They don't just put a fucking ad in the paper saying, "Come on, get killed on film." So what if they lure nice, unsuspecting guys that go on a dating website like me, you know, vulnerable, and they know they're getting nice, normal guys. And it's some hot girl "film director" who makes "porn," and then they get you up there, and they fucking grab you and kill you, filming it? Okay, nobody wants to kill you in a snuff movie. Will you just come with me, please? [♪] ♪ We are alone together ♪ I hope that it will be this way ♪ ♪ Allowed to touch each other ♪ ♪ And wait for the next day ♪ ♪ It might not be forever... Yeah, 881 Wall. [buzzes] [buzzes] [man] Yeah? Pancakes and eggs. Password. Oh, yeah. Definitely a snuff movie. [door buzzes] [elevator bell dings] I don't think we should take the elevator. We should take the stairs. We need an escape route. A fucking elevator's like a death trap. I mean, they might even stop the elevator halfway up and film us being killed right in there. -Okay, I'm going home. -No, come on, just take the stairs, come on, just stay, come on. [♪] [woman moaning] [woman] Yeah, fuck me harder. Oh, I love your solid, hard cock in my fucking tight pussy. -Ooh, scary. -Shut up. -Oh, my God. -Yeah. Unless he fucks her to death, nobody's getting killed here today. So can I go home now? No, come on, just stay, just stay. Just stay with me. ...big fucking cock. Oh, yes. Oh, yes, give it to me, baby. I want to fucking feel that dick tomorrow. Oh, my God. -[whispers] Hey. -[whispers] Hi. I'm Splick, this is my friend, Jason. Oh, hi. Amy. Um, we're gonna take a break in a minute, and then we can talk. -Okay, great. -'Kay. [indistinct dialog] Yeah, give it to me. Harder, hard. Yeah. Her feet aren't in the shot. What? Oh, I'm so sorry, nothing. I'm sorry. No, what did you say? I just think it's sexier if you can see her feet when he's fucking her. See, your camera guy is chopping off the frame at the knees, so you can't see her feet. See? Oh, yeah. Hey, Jim, widen out so we can see Deb's feet while she's fucking him. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Just like that. Right there. That's much hotter. [Deb moans] [whispers] Did I just become a porn director? -Yes. -[Deb] Harder. Yeah. [moaning] Cut, cut, cut. There's a shadow on his cock. I can't see penetration. This isn't fucking porn noir, people, okay? I need to see it going in. Oh, hey, how'd that-- how'd that date go with -the fill-in last night? -It actually went really well. -Yeah? -Yeah. -So, this is really cool. -Oh, thanks. I've never been on a porn set before. -Welcome. -Thanks. You're even prettier than your picture. I mean, you're really pretty in your picture, but you're-- Thank you so much. Am I more, less than or equally handsome than mine? -Than your what? -My picture. Oh, you look fine. So I'm not as handsome, or... No, you look good. Are you disappointed? No, you look fine. You look good. I'm happy with how you look. -All right? -Okay. Hey, listen, Amy. I got to pick up my kids at the Rangers game in about, like, an hour, so I'm getting kind of raw. I know, but Ralph didn't show up today, so we have Pierre as a pinch hitter. He's having a little trouble getting it up. Pierre, how are we doing? Give me a second. [Jason] What, no fluffers around? Not for me, I mean, for Pierre. No, Viagra killed the fluffers. Well, video killed the radio stars. Oh, um, Splick, Jason, meet Ed. Oh, hey, man, how you doing? Namaste. Okay. Oh, namaste. How you doing, dude? What's up, bro? Nah. Okay Hey, Ed. Come over here and look at this. All right. Hey, nice to meet you guys. You too, man. It's looking all-- -Seems great. -Oh, thanks, man. So, did you like my list of my five favorite things? Your what? -My list of my five favorite things in my profile. I don't know what you're talking about. Of all the internet dates you've ever had... -Right. -What percentage have been more fun than me so far? -What percentage-- What? -Like, on a scale of one to ten, if ten was the most fun you've had with any guy you've met off the internet-- or, anywhere, for that matter-- you know, like the initial vibe when you first meet them, What am I? And you can be honest. I need to finish this scene. Pierre, are we ready? We're good. okay, we start with Pierre getting a blow job. Ed, you fuck her in the ass. After a few minutes, we move to the ATM. Okay, roll sound. Roll camera. Action! What's an ATM? [Deb moaning] Add the man? Ask the maid? Is there a maid coming? Is she a maid? [Jason] After the mount? Oh. Ass to mouth. Ass... to mouth. [moaning] A bundle? I'm a fucking bundle? You did come off a little bit needy. -Oh, thanks a lot. -Listen, you know, you just like to accumulate all the information and data in the first four to six minutes of the date. Okay, but I don't think that makes me a fucking bundle. Well, you know, maybe you need to just sort of date people more of your own intensity level. Or, you know, consider adjusting your intensity level a little bit. Fuck her, porn bitch. You can't say that. Those dates were stupid. I'm done with all that dating. [♪] [coins clattering] Good morning, Jeremy! -Uh, Jason. -Jason! Do you like my niece? You know what? I'm sorry, I've been very, very busy, and I haven't had a chance to read her letter. Uh, I'm sorry, Latchkaya, but I will, I will get to it. One picture, please? Sorry, Christie, -can you move, please? -[Christie] Latchkaya! Immigration would like it better just me and my honey. -Sorry. -My baby. [shutter clicks] -What's happening? -Nothing. That Latchkaya is trying to fix me up with his Lithuanian niece. -I think that girl viewed me. -You know what's weird? Since I went on that website, when I see that women walk by, I just want to click on them and find out, what are your five favorite things? What kind of relationship are you looking for? What age range? 18 to 26? 31 to 57? How are you supposed to know anything about these people? So, listen, we're making that movie now, right? No. Why do you keep saying that, Jason? We already did all that. Okay, look, let's recap, 'cause I'm very confused. Do we or do we not have girlfriends? -No, nobody has any girlfriends. -All right, well, who viewed us? No one viewed us, and that's fine. We got to get away from those digital robot ladies and try to connect with actual human women in the analog world. Hello. Hi. -What are you doing? -I was trying to be an actual analog man connecting with analog women on Earth but she didn't want to join me. Okay, well, the analog women might get a little freaked out if they don't know you -and you just start saying hi to them. -Well, how am I gonna get to know them? I have to say hello to them, and then they're gonna join me to get to know me that way. -[sighs] -Hi. Hi. Hi! Okay, I don't know that shouting at people's backs is a good way to get to know anybody. Hello. Hi. Hi. Are you on your way to do yoga? Yeah. I teach, actually. -Really? -Yeah. Wow, that's fancy. [giggling] Do you practice? -Practice what? -[laughs] Yoga. You know, I don't, but I would really like to come to one of your classes so you can teach me how to practice yoga. Well, you totally should. -Really? -Yeah. -Where do you teach? -Um... right up this-- around here. Here. my e-mail is on there, and then there's a copy of the classes that I teach. -They're highlighted. -Thanks. I really like how direct you are. -Thank you. -Do you have a boyfriend? [laughs] Um, no. Want to go to dinner with me after class? [laughs] How about you come to class, and then we take it from there? Oh, so, you don't know if you like me well enough to commit to dinner right now? Uh, no, I didn't say that. I didn't say that. I just-- You should come to class. Okay. Okay, I got to go. Bye. [giggles] -What the hell are you doing? -I can't deal with that girl. She doesn't even know if she likes me well enough to go on a fucking date. Okay? I'm sick of all these scared, game-playing girls. -I'm too old for this shit. -Okay, look. Shouting at people on the street, you somehow get one girl to actually respond to you, invite you to take her class, possibly even a date, and you just want to throw her in the garbage can. [sighs] This might be a good chance for you to try adjusting your intensity level a little bit. So, what? You think I should go take her class? Yes, you should go to her class. [♪] [coins rattling] -Oh, great. -What? Fuck, it's my ex-girlfriend, the great love of my life. -Sarah Jane? -Yeah, with her whole little family. -Do you want to go? -Yeah. -Jason? -Hey. -Hey, how are you? -I can't believe it. I thought you lived in L.A. now. Big movie star. Um, I've actually been-- I've been back for a while now, yeah. Oh, uh, meet my kids. This is David. He's my four-year-old. And this is Ellen. She's six. This is my old friend, Jason. -Say hi. -Hi. [Sarah Jane] He's shy. What movie are you in? Uh, that was a long time ago, actually, yeah. It was way before you were born. Yeah. Um, you never met Splick, did you? No, right, you work together. -Yeah, yeah, we do. -We did. Well, we do again now, too. Another movie? So exciting. Actually, no, I'm-- I'm working on a book now. A book. Wow. Wait a minute, wait a minute. I can make her class right now. -What am I thinking? -Well, are you sure? -Right now? -Yeah, yeah. I gotta-- It was so nice to meet you guys. I have to go to yoga, now. Nice to meet you. So you finally finished medical school? What is that, like, 14 years or something? Yeah, yeah, it seemed like it was 14 years, yeah. But, yes, I am an actual doctor now. -New York Hospital. -That's incredible. You, too. I'm so proud of you. Hmm. Ooh, money! [Sarah Jane] No, sweetie, that's not ours. -Can I go ahead? -Uh, yeah, yeah, go ahead, sorry. No, I got it. Really, I got it. -I got it. -Okay, Well, uh, it was great seeing you. Yeah, it was great seeing you, too. I gotta get the kids home, but maybe coffee sometime? Uh, yeah, that'd be great, yeah. -I would like that, yeah. -Great. Uh. Okay. Yeah. -Okay, see ya, bye. -[Sarah Jane] Bye. [chanting] [all chanting] -Hi, is this the yoga studio? -Uh-huh. Okay, great. I'd like to take April's class, please. I need some yoga outfit. Do you sell stuff for boys? What do I need? Like, stretchy pants? I'm fine. I mean, I'm fine. I was a dancer in college, so I feel comfortable in spandex, whatever. Oh, and I need a mat. Do you guys have mats? Do you sell mats? I could rent it. Do I wear my socks when I'm doing it? I'm sorry, sir, but the class already started, so-- In all honesty, that's probably better because it's my first time, and I probably can't make it through a whole one anyway. 'Cause I wouldn't want to slow the class down. Is it a thing where I do slow the class down if I'm in there and I'm slower than everybody else? Do they get-- Does anyone get angry at me or anything? Well, I don't-- Well, we don't have anger here, but I-- Can I get-- Do you get kicked out of yoga? Oh, that's not really how it works. There's no, like, cuckolding in yoga. Right? They don't laugh at me if I'm-- Or like just even throw mean vibes at me? No, that's the opposite of yoga, right? -It's good vibes. -They chant, and then she does a dharma talk, and then they meditate, and then they start moving. So you should really get the complete experience. Oh. Oh, no, I got you, I got you. So you're saying it-- you say it'd be inappropriate for me to just sort of barge in right now at this juncture. Right. Thank you very much. I appreciate-- I appreciate you. And in the silence, we hear the unstruck sound, which is "om." May I help you, sir? -I'm just gonna pop in real quick. -Oh, sir, but-- [quietly] Hi, excuse me. I'm so sorry. I know I'm not supposed to come in mid-drama talk... but I just wanted to bring you a little gift. -Thanks. [chuckles] -[all] Aww... And some almonds in case you get a little hungry there. Thank you. Sorry, sorry, everyone. Is that your boyfriend? No, I actually just met him on the street, like 45 minutes ago. [laughter] Yeah. Bye. Have a good week. -Hi. -Hi. You made quite an impression on my class. -Excellent. -They swooned. -Did you? -A little. Maybe. -But... -But what? You might just be one of those guys who's all about the excitement of the chase. What are you talking about? I'm all about the excitement of the beautiful happily ever after, marriage, babies, love. And who says that he's all about the excitement of the happily ever after, marriage, babies, love, but is really only about the rush of falling in love. I'm not gonna lie. I mean, I mean, it's really exciting to be in love and-- and have your ego boundaries fall away and merge like a child into one chocolate baby and, you know, love everything about the girl and-- "The girl," just like, any girl. No, not any girl. You. Well, not you, I mean, I don't know you well enough to have it be you, but, maybe... maybe you. Actually, you know what? I hate when people say that. "I don't know you well enough." I know in-- in ten seconds. I know if I have a chemistry with you, if I have, like, a-- that thing, that spark, that vibe. I know right away if I like how you smell. I mean, it's all about the smell. I-- I love how you smell. -What if I were a Nazi? -What? What if I were a really, really good-smelling Nazi? Would you-- Would you detect that in your initial 30-second chocolate-baby endorphin vibe? Look, we have a really substantial chance to fall in love, you and I, if you would just stop being so pessimistic all the time. [laughs] Wait, you're-- I mean, you're not a Nazi, are you? [laughs] No, I was just making a point. Okay, look. Here's what were gonna do. We're gonna go on a proper date. That way, we-- we can get to know each other, and everything you were talking about, whatever. Get to know each other, whatever. We'll be able to find out... if this initial, you know, connection that we have is real or not. We have an initial connection? [whispering] You know we do. [whispering] Do I? [whispering] Yeah, you do. [chuckles] All right. Here's the deal. You prove to me that you can slow down, and I will give you a shot. -Okay. -All right. Fine. I will, uh-- I'll call you tonight. No, that's not slowing down. What? I want to take you out right now. Well, I want to go out on Friday night. Friday? [scoffs] That's, like, in three weeks. That's in three days. Tomorrow day. No, Friday night. Tomorrow night? And that's my final offer. Thursday night. And don't-- don't-- don't say anything else, because if you do, it's gonna move even further. All right? I will win your test. [April laughs] -You watch. -[laughs] All right. Till Thursday night. [♪] All right, what happened with that yoga girl? Oh. she's gonna marry me, but I got to wait till Thursday. -I want now, she wanted Friday. -Good, she's making you wait. -[scoffs] Whatever. -Well, I like her. What happened with that Sarah Jane? What? Nothing. She has a husband. [scoffs] That girl is totally in love with you. She's not in love with me. She's in love with somebody else that she's actually married to. Oh, please, Jason, it's so clear that girl's into you. I mean, the fact that she went off and married somebody else and had babies, that's what they do when you "disobtain" them in their 20s and you don't stay with them, they find someone else to do that with. It's no reflection on you. I mean, please, you could have any girl you want. That's why I'm still single, 'cause I refuse to settle. I want smart, sexy, and funny. Okay, if that girl's gonna be with me fucking 24 hours a day, all day and all night, every day of the rest of my life, -I have to really like her. -Okay, well, you're not gonna be with her in your house every hour, every day, okay? And you have to compromise a little bit. Look, I-- Of course I'll compromise. Take out the trash, and put my toothbrush wherever she wants that to go. -I mean, that's fine, all that. -That's not what I'm talking about, okay? You're never gonna get every single thing you want from one person. I mean, you're gonna get different things from different people. You have a whole community around you. That's what I'm saying, okay? Look, you and she will be out on a double date -with some other couple. -Who? I don't know, some other friend couple. -You? -No, I'm not gonna let my family around you. Okay, well, you're my best friend, so I don't know where you think this magical other-friend couple -is gonna appear from. -Well, they're her friends. She's a proper girl, she'll have friends. They'll become your friends. -I'm not gonna like her friends. -Okay, well, these friends, you do like. I mean, I'm gonna want to fuck her friends. -Yeah, but you can't say that. -And after six months, I'M gonna imagine them fucking me when she's fucking me, and I'll jerk off thinking about fucking-- Oh, man, if she has a sister... She's cute, but probably-- And her mother, even, 'cause I'll think of a whole fucking three-way with that, -but I'm not gonna-- -God, it's hard having a girlfriend. [laughs] That's what I'm trying to say. Man, that's why you cannot-- you must not settle. Look, you have to settle a little bit, okay? This is what I'm trying to say, you and she will be out on the double date with this other couple, and you and the guy will talk about whatever guy things, like, I don't know, football or Discovery Channel shows about bear attacks or whatever, and she'll be inside with the girl, and they'll talk about babies or Lady Gaga' s outfit or neo-impressionist painting. I don't know. But the bottom line is you will have somebody who loves you and cares for you and supports you and it actually makes her happy to do that. And you'll have a happy life. Why are you trying to make me cry? That's what I'm saying. [sighs] That sounds amazing, man. When do we buy all that? I don't know. Now. I have a very good feeling about that yoga girl, and I'm gonna buy all that with that girl at any point she lets me actually have a date with her. And you, you'll re-buy that all with that Sarah Jane. -We'll be done. -No. That's long over and done with. Whatever happened with that Latchkaya niece girl? Come on. Realistically, I'm gonna marry some 21-year-old Lithuanian girl? Oh, yeah, that would really suck. Some beautiful, sweet, innocent girl who's not all jaded and Sex And The City'dout, who's gonna take care of you and love on you and cherish you and support you, you just said all that. All right, fine. [Jason] She's cute. What do you mean? She's fucking hot. "Hello, I am a cheerful, sympathetic person "with good sense of humor. "At me, it is a lot of hobbies, "and a hobby such for example as the nature. "To prepare reading of books, "knitting of woolen things. "I think that the life is fun if to take from it everything "that can give us a life in our world. "First of all, I would like to tell that "I look simply good person, what to create with him "happy family where there would be a care, "caress, and understanding. "I look kind and sympathetic the man who could understand me. "I do not look that over natural, "and I respect almost every person. "I think that the main trust in relations and understanding. "If these qualities are present at pair, "they can be happy. I should be very glad if you will write to me. Lenka." -She sounds great. -Good. You marry her. Oh, come on. Why are you depressed? where are you trying to go? -First day of my new job. -But you said we're making that movie now. Splick, all joking aside, could you please stop saying that? It's like rubbing salt into the wound of my soul life stream. Which is officially dead today with the beginning of my box-carrying career. Well, guess what? I'm your best friend, and as your best friend, I care as much about your soul life stream as you do, and I'm not really willing to let your soul life stream die just yet. How about that? Why are you trying to make me cry? We're gonna make that movie. We will, okay? You have to put that out in the collective unconscious. Put that out in the actual conscious conscious, for that matter, okay? You must see it. You must stop saying no. If we see it, it will be so. Nobody's giving us any money to make a movie. When we made My Life's In Turnaround, we had to shoot on 16 millimeter or 35. That was all there was. Now you shoot on tape for $10, it looks like the fucking Godfather. You can't just make it for $10, okay? You need more than that. And, you know, you need some kind of video-level star or something. So, if I get us some video-level stars and a few grand, you'll make the movie. Depends on how fast I rise in my new company. Deal. [sighs] [♪] Uh, hey. Kaheem? -Jason? -Yeah. [chuckles] Uh, you see those boxes over there? -Yeah. -We just got to load those boxes on the van. You good with that? -Yeah. -Okay [♪] Pardon-- Pardon me. Is F. Murray Abraham at home? [woman] Ah, no, Mr. Abraham is not home right now, no. But he does live here? Oh, yes, yes, he lives here, yes, yes. So sorry. -He's just not here now. -Ah, no, no. He's not home. So sorry. Do you know where he is? He's in South America, in Argentina. Argentina. May I ask your name so I can tell him who you are? I was supposed to direct him in his next feature film project with Mr. Jason Little. We were gonna co-direct him in a-- in a feature film project. But I guess we can't-- we can't shoot in South America. We can't shoot in Argentina. I'm so sorry he's not here. All right, well, thank you very much. Um, I just have another meeting I need to take right now real quick. Could I take it on your stoop? Good first day, Jason. You can take off now. -Thanks. -All right, man. [Splick] Does he have wireless? Does wireless come from the building? -[woman] Wireless, uh? -[Splick] Internet? I-I-I think so. I see him use computer when he home, so I-- Yes. [man] Mr. Harbraugh's office. Yes, hi. I have Mr. Splick Featherstone calling for Mr. Harbraugh. [man] May I ask what this is in reference to? Uh, he's calling, I believe-- he can tell you better-- but I think he's calling about Brian Dennehy's availability for a feature film project starting tomorrow in New York City. [man] We no longer represent Mr. Dennehy, sir. -Oh, you don't. -[man] No. Uh, do you know who does represent Mr. Dennehy at this point? [man] No. Okay. Um, I know that Mr. Featherstone also had on his very, very short list another one of your clients, Mr. Hume Cronyn. Is Mr. Cronyn available tomorrow? [man] Uh, Hume Cronyn died. -Really? -[man] In 2003. -In 2003? -[man] Yeah. Well, I'm v-- I'm very sorry. [man] So am I. Uh... Don Ameche also was on our list, -uh, the short list of-- -[man] He passed in 1993. -1993? -[man] Yes. He died. Really? Could you-- Could you please tell me, uh, who from Cocoonis-- is not dead? [man] Uh, I, really, I don't have time for this right now. -I have another call. -No, okay. Okay, well, thank you very much. -[man] You, too. -You have a nice day. -[man] Bye-bye. -Bye-Bye. Annie, wait. Annie. Annie... [♪] It's wild to see you in all your official doctor regalia. [chuckles] Yeah, I know. Can you believe they actually trust me with people's hearts? I actually do. Oh, I'm glad I ran into you. Yeah, it's, its been a long time, huh? Yeah. Yeah, it has. So, what, have you've been married, what is it, 10 years now? Nine. Well, that's fantastic. Well, marriage is challenging. Yeah, make no mistake about it. But what Ken and I have works for us. I mean, he knows he's not the big love of my life. But there was someone like that before me, too, for him. I'm not saying that we don't love each other. We do. It's just it's, uh, it's-- it's been a bit more of a struggle lately. We both work so much, and with two kids now-- I can't even imagine what that's like, honestly. Yeah. You know... to be perfectly honest, we're taking a little bit of a break. -Really? -Yeah. Wow. I mean, I'm sorry. I'm sorry to hear it. Yeah, I don't know what's gonna happen. But can I just tell you how proud I am of you? That you followed your dreams, and all the success you've had. When I was walking down the street, however many years ago that was, and I saw your movie poster, tears welled up in my eyes. So, when do you start the new movie? I don't think I'm gonna do that. Really? Why? That life's just too erratic, and it's too many ups and downs, and you know, honestly, at this point, I just-- I want a normal life. What's a "normal" life? [cell phone rings] That. I'm sorry. [chuckles] -I'd love to stay. -Well, somebody needs your help. It always takes me a second to believe they've got the right person. Yeah, um... yeah. Oh. Yeah. [chuckles] Let's talk soon. Yeah, um... yeah. Just right out here, they'll help you, okay? -Okay -Great seeing you. Okay. [sighs] Okay. [♪] Hey, so all we got is these last few boxes left and then you can take off, man. -Cool. -All right? Thanks. Yeah, you need to quit all this job now, because I just got our movie green-lit. -Yeah, right. -Did you or did you not say that if I got us a movie star and a couple thousand dollars, -you would make the movie? -Maybe. Yeah, okay, well, I got us all that. Okay, who? Who is the star of every Woody Allen movie ever made? Woody Allen. Okay, besides him. Diane Keaton. -Besides her. -Mia Farrow. No, Tony Roberts! Tony Roberts is! Well, you can't really say Tony Roberts is the star of every Woody Allen movie. I mean, Woody Allen, technically, is the star of-- Okay, well, whatever, second star, second star. I first took F. Murray Abraham's meeting, but he's busy making a movie in Jakarta for, like, six years. Everyone else, sadly, you know, is dead. -What? Who's dead? -Don't-- Just listen to my mouth for a minute, okay? I took Tony Roberts's meeting incidentally on the street, okay? He said he would not only be in our movie, but he comes with a financier that will bring us $800,000. That's for any movie that he's in, as long as it's one of four types of movies. All right, what are the four types of movies? Teen sexploitation, like American Pie. Stoner movie, like Dude, Where's My Car? Horror, Blair Witch Project kind of thing. Family movie with a dog. And they say they do very, very well with family movies with a dog. Okay, well, we're not teen sex virgins. Uh, we don't even smoke pot. Only one of us is scary. And we have neither a family nor a dog. I mean, I did once have a dog when I was a kid, but it just bit me in the face and ran away. Okay, whatever, you know, we're gonna write our own good versions of that, okay? $800,000. You think we could do that? Write our own good version? Okay, look. I know that I'm new here, but I do believe Kaheem likes me, and I think there's at least a possibility I could get you in here. Now, it wouldn't be starting this high up, obviously. It would be more like entry-level. Mm-hm. Okay, I'm gonna have to go ahead and disallow you from fear mongering yourself out of making our film. And I just need you to be properly prepared to meet Mr. Tony Roberts and his financiers on Friday at your house at 5:00, okay? All good, Kaheem. Okay, at any point, can I call my yoga girl? -Can I call her now? -No, two more days. Why do I have to wait? It's so fucking stupid. Well, there's a mandatory waiting period to buy a handgun, and this girl presciently understands that your enthusiasm -is at least, if not more, dangerous. -Okay, what you don't understand and what you need to just claim without embarrassment or apology is that women are crazy, okay? They are crazy? Yeah, I'm not trying to be glib or mean, but I mean, just look at their faces, I mean, twisted, chaotic, I mean, literally on the verge of screaming in bewildered terror at how to survive. I mean, I don't even know how they can function, really, like, go from place to place and eat and drink and walk and talk. Well, I don't know about any of that, but I will admit that it does seem that at times, it's like those people have some expanded autonomic nervous system that covers the basic functions like how to walk, you know, blink, say hi, hold a cup, "Hi, my name is Rachel." But underneath all that, there's some other entity trying to seize control of the wheelhouse, and it's like some swirling morass of hormonally driven emotion. Yeah, but see, if they had the proper man-side, then they could fix the fucked-up, broken girl-side. Yeah, but they don't want anything fixed. That's why when they come to you with a problem and you try to offer a solution, they hate you with a deeper ferocity than you ever thought imaginable. Look, I just have one question, and I'm really-- I really-- I don't want this to sound harsh at all, but why do you think God created them? Okay, if we could just shit the babies out all in one man machine, it would have solved everything. I mean, don't get me wrong. I fucking love the women. I mean, they're pretty and they're soft and they smell nice and they love you and they hold you and... God, it feels really good when they put their mouth on your dick, but then they just start talking. I mean, have you ever heard the difference between a male and a female sauna? Okay, the female sauna is like fucking, "yak yak yak yak yakkity yakkity yakkity yak yak yak." And the male sauna is just... silent. I mean, for one fucking second in the universe, could they just sit and be quiet and breathe and hear the nature? But they won't. Okay, they won't, because all they'll hear is the relentless pounding of their own inability to reason booming in their mind like the voice of God saying, "I made a mistake in creating you." Wait a minute. Women are a mistake? Is that what you're trying to say? No, of course not. I'm not saying that. Well, I mean... Well, nothing, when you talk like that, it doesn't surprise me people call you a misogynist. Oh, please, Jason. It's implicit that I love and honor and respect women and that I'm abjectly lonely and desperately want to get married and have babies. Well, it's not implicit in that crazy speech you just made. Oh, please, that's one thought I have. I mean, you know you have seven million thoughts per second, -right? -Oh, of course, yeah. Yeah, so, that's just one thought. I also think that men are pathetic and that I'm just some small-dick, talentless fuck whose only value is, you know, carrying an air conditioner into the kitchen and giving my wife a baby, and if she wants to have any chance at a complex, rich relationship, thank God, you know, that he made women to have that with. That's thought number 4,000,621. Yeah, but you don't say that thought. Well, I didn't just now, but I might in a second from now. And we're not our thoughts, anyway. Okay, you think of driving your car up onto the fucking sidewalk and mowing down hundreds of people sometimes, but you don't do it, so that makes you not a mass murderer. No, actually, I don't think about that. You've never thought of killing someone you hate, someone who annoys you, someone who hurt you, just taking out a gun and blowing their fucking brains out. Just one random thought. Or fucking putting their mouth on a curb and smashing their head, like what that Ed Norton did in American History X -and curbing them. -No, no, I definitely do not. -No, I do not think that. -Okay, well, call me crazy. You know, once in a while, I have. You know, but I don't do it. I don't act out in any kind of violent way. I just-- It's just a thought. You know, the way I act out in the world is that I, you know, I give to homeless dog puppy shelter donations and I help old ladies with their bags, and I smile at blind people. And so therefore, my actions are that of a loving person and not of a hateful person, even though for once in a while, I might think some evil, weird, creepy fucking thought and I don't think I'm that different than every fucking everybody else. Yeah, but the problem is, if people don't know you, they don't realize that. So if you don't have somebody going around with you all the time saying, "Hey, that's just one of the seven million thoughts that that guy's having. He's really not a mean, homicidal, hater person," They may not know that, and they won't understand. Okay, well, you come around with me, you explain it to 'em. No, I cannot go around with you and exp-- No, I cannot go around with you and explain everything. Well, why don't you get rejected for thinking that way? Because I don't think that way. -But you do. -No, I don't. -You say you do when we joke. -Yeah, but I don't mean it. Well, neither do I. That's my-- That's my point! Yeah, but it sometimes seems like you do mean it. Well, in some over-the-top satirical way, but so do you in that same hyperbolic way. You don't really mean it. And you're full of shit if you fucking say that you don't, -'cause I know you. -[siren blares] Okay, well, I don't think that way, so... What are you saying? You just fucking-- Am I just some mind-control fucking Svengali fucking wilding misogynist leader of your brain [stammering] and-- and you're just-- you're just some little meek 45-year-old woman who's crying 'cause I won't ask you out because you can't give me a fucking baby in five years? Yeah, see, that's what I'm talking about. When you say fucking stupid shit like that without any consideration for how offensive it is to people. Is that-- Wait, are you being serious now? -Yes, I'm being serious. -Okay, well, the person that you're making me out to be would have to be like the most insensitive cunt in the universe. So, if you really think that I'm that person, why would you want to even be friends with me? You know what? Sometimes you do make it a little fucking hard. Really? Well, maybe, you know, it's too much work for you, Jason, and maybe you just don't want to do it anymore. You know what? Maybe I don't. Maybe you don't. Well, thank you for having the fucking courage, you know, to at least speak that truth from your own fucking brain and not have to be mind-control Svengali'd into saying shit that you don't mean. That's big of you. You know, thank you for that gift. Whatever, man. -Fucking take care, man. -Fine. [♪] -Hi, Mama. -Hi, honey. What's wrong? [sighs] Nothin'. What's happening with the movie that you and Jason are making? [scoffs] We're not doing that anymore. Really? Why? Uh, because he thinks that I'm a narcissistic, misogynistic psychopath or something. [scoffs] That's ridiculous. I treat you well, don't I, Mom? Of course, honey. I don't know. Everybody hates my movies and my shows and-- and I met this girl on the street, thought she was really cute. And she's a yoga teacher and really seemed like she liked me, and now she's ma-- making me wait, like, six months before I'm allowed to call her or something. [sighs] I mean, maybe I really am just crazy, like everybody says. I mean, you don't know what you don't know, so I could be, and just not know it. Why is she making you wait six months to call her? She said that I could just be some guy that's all about the chase and excited and... I don't know. This yogic test or proving. I don't know. You know, when you were a baby, I was in love with my ex-boyfriend. I mean, I was crazy about your dad, and we got married, but I couldn't stop thinking about this other guy. So your dad and I had a very traumatic two-year marriage. We fought all the time. [sighs] I should have stayed with my ex-boyfriend. But then, I wouldn't have been born. I know. That wouldn't have been good, Mom. No, that would not have been good. What's your point? Well, you've got to be true to yourself, or else it's not gonna be good in the end. I mean, it turned out great for you because-- because you were born and for me because I love you. But it took me 30 years to find Will and be happy. You know, as-- as a woman. I don't have a clue what you're talking about, Mom. [clears throat] Don't wait six months to call this girl. If she doesn't want to go out with you today... then fuck her. [chuckles] [♪] -[Splick] Hi. -[door closes] I'm really sorry. I really apologize. I know this is fucked up, but life is short, and I-- I just have to talk to you for a second. Please forgive me. I don't meet a lot of girls that I like. Never, ever. It's so rare. And I like you. I really like you. But I need-- I need to have you like me back, at least with a little bit of enthusiasm, or it's not fun for me. If you're not the kind of girl who gets excited when you meet somebody that you could maybe fall in love with, and I-- I know that you don't know if you're in love with me. I'm not suggesting you should be in love with me from one meeting on the street, but-- but that whole idea of being single and meeting people you like is you get excited. And-- And-- And if that doesn't make your heart race and-- and give you butterflies and make you want to see that person as fast as humanly possible-- and I understand we're all busy, we have our lives-- but come on. I mean, we make time for things that are important to us. Or maybe you are that kind of person, and I just don't inspire it. So it's just not with me. And-- And that would be fine. I mean, I wouldn't be fine. I'd be disappointed. But I could accept that. I would respect that. But I just sort of-- I just want to know. I just would like to know that right now, because I'm very sensitive, and I get my feelings hurt, especially when I like somebody and I feel there's potential like there is with you. So, if there's some reason that I'm not thinking of for why you don't want to see me sooner than the mandatory waiting period you've instituted, can you just explain that to me, please? Anything? You don't-- you don't have anything to say to that? [♪] [♪] [Sarah Jane] All right, but we should definitely reschedule. -[woman] Okay. -Excuse me. Hey, how are you? Hey. What are you doing here? Actually, I was in the neighborhood, and I-- I realized there was something I want to-- I want to ask you about. Yeah, sure. Uh, just give me a second, and then... Uh, yeah, I-- You know, I just had my annual physical, and my doctor said that my cholesterol was, like, borderline, -so I was just wondering-- -Oh, I see. Well, what was the breakdown? Uh, I think the total was like 201, but, you know, whatever the bad one is, like the H.D.L. or the D.D.L. or something, that was a little high. So, the L.D.L. was a little high. Yes, L.D.L., that sounds right, yeah. Uh, I think he said it was like 135. Oh, that's not really anything to be concerned about, but let's just give it a little look. Breathe. Deep breath. [breathes deeply] And another. [breathes deeply] Hold. Okay, let it go. [♪] [cell phone rings] [ringing stops] [cell phone rings again] -I'm sorry, I'm sorry-- -No, it's not you. No, I shouldn't have done that, I don't know. Listen, um, I just don't think this is the right thing for us. Yeah, yeah, probably not. I don't-- I'm sure it's not. What we had was... It was very special. And I don't know what else to say about it. Um, yeah, no, I'm-- I-- No, I totally understand. I mean, no, you're right. You're right. Ken and I are gonna try and make it work. [sighs] Okay, uh-- No, that's-- that's definitely good. I'm sure that's definitely for the-- for the best. I should go, I guess, uh... but you, you think I'm gonna be okay? Yeah, more than okay. You know, uh... actually, there is one little thing I'm concerned about. -What's that? -Last time, when you said you were done with the movie stuff and you just wanted a normal life... for you... that is your normal life. Hmm... [♪] -Hi, Jason. -Hey, Mrs. Featherstone. Hey, come on in. You want something to drink? Uh, I can't right now. Thanks. -Oh, Splick isn't here. -Hmm. Do you know where he went? No. he was very depressed when he came home last night, though. He went out earlier. I don't know where he went. Hmm, okay, thanks. it was nice seeing you. You, too.

The memory of my last meeting with you wasn't very good. Well, which part of the meeting? The part where you told me I shouldn't have been born. Oh, wait, sorry, that-- that wasn't you. That was my mother. -No, she didn't say that. -Something like that. Well, what are you gonna do, you know? You can't carry grudges around your whole life. You have disagreements, you've got to move on. I thought you didn't want to be friends with evil, mean me. Well... maybe that was just one of the seven million thoughts I was having in that moment. Well, would you like to share another one of your seven million thoughts that might possibly make me into a positive situation, or-- Yeah, making that movie. [laughs] You're back, wanting to make that movie now? Yes. We just have to make that. We can't worry about if anybody likes it or doesn't like it or cares about us or doesn't care about us. It's like those squirrels. They just go around and collect that acorn. They don't worry about if anybody likes their acorn-collecting. You know, or that tugboat just pulls that barge up and down the river, you know? It doesn't-- It's not concerned whether anybody thinks it's a good barge-puller. You know, we make the movies. You know, we just have to just make it. That's just what we do. Wait, what time is it? -Oh, fuck, we're late for our meeting. -What? Where? We have a meeting with Tony Roberts at your fucking house. Come on, let's go! [speaking French] [laughter] Jason! Look, look, who come to surprise visit! Lienka Pienka! [heavy accent] My movie star man, in real world. -Jason! -Latchkaya, I told you, I can't marry Lenka. No, I not for marry to you. No offense. You even handsome than picture in life. But I engaged to William at present. Oh, hello, William. No, that's not William. -That's Tony "Robair." -Who? [French accent] Tony Robert, enchanté. Enchanté. That's William. -Hi, William Davis. -Thanks, lover. -Jason Little. -Pleasure. Latchkaya, is-is-is Tony Roberts here at all? Yes! Tony "Robair"! Can I talk to you for a second inside? Sure. Excuse us. What's going on? In what context? In the context that you said we had a meeting with Tony Roberts, and there's now a French man named Tony "Robair" sitting in my living room. Oh. Yeah. -I understand what you mean. -Okay, so you had a meeting -with Tony Roberts. -Yeah. -The Tony Roberts from the Woody Allen movies.-Right. The Tony Roberts who's Woody Allen's best friend who moves to L.A. and wears the spacesuit to protect himself from the sun. Right. Okay, you and Tony Roberts took a meeting together in person? I took his-his-his agent's meeting on the-- on the phone. And his agent said that he could get you Tony Roberts, not Tony "Robair." Jason... I had to dial a lot of numbers. He had a, like, a French agent who spoke with a little bit of an accent. I didn't think about it. Tony Roberts, Tony "Robair." Okay, but now, in this scenario, does it now seem a little bit weird to you? Okay, yes, now, maybe. Maybe, maybe not. Who knows? Weird, not weird. Okay, whatever. Who cares who the fuck is here? Let's stop crying about it, and let's go make a movie with him, okay? Mr. "Robair," do you have a financier that will give us $800,000 to make a movie with you? Sorry, my English is not so good. I'm sorry, I'll slow down. Do you have money to make a film with us? Yes, money, yes. -To make a movie. -Yes. Here, in America? No. -Where do we have to make it? -In France. But we can make it in English? I don't understand. [speaking French] [speaking French] No, only the French language. [scoffs] Great. -You know French? -No, you idiot, do you? No. But we have Mr. Tony "Robair," okay, $800,000, and a green-lit French fucking movie. We'll learn how to speak French. I mean, how hard can it be? We get the Evelyn Wood reading tapes, and we're done. Okay, but what's it gonna be about? We don't have one of those four stupid ideas. No, no. He like your book very much. Yes, yes. The book, I like very much. Oh, oh, great. So now you're trying to cut me out of the French version of your book movie? -What? -Nice. What are you even talking about? And the book's in English. And it's not a family story. [speaking in French] But what do you mean? Your friendship is woven all through it. I'm in your book? I don't remember. [speaking in French] Woven all through it. I'm woven all through it? Maybe one little part about you trying to beat me out of all my money and ideas. Why are you trying to make me cry in front of Mr. Tony "Robair"? [speaking in French] It's the perfect story of the modern family. [Tony speaking French] Sometimes, a little messy. [speaking French] Sometimes, a little uncomfortable. [speaking French] Sometimes confusing. [Tony speaking in French] But authentic. That's what people want. [speaking French] The truth. [speaking French] That's what's gonna move them. [speaking in French] The fantasy of a nuclear family has disappeared completely. [Tony speaking French] [Lenka] So it is, you have a very family movie. Um, what's going on in here? I wouldn't even really know how to begin to explain it, but it's all good. We're apparently a perfect French family, and they're gonna give us money to make a movie about it. Isn't he so cute? we just got him from the pound. -Aww... -C'est adorable. [cell phone rings] -Hello? -[April] Hi. I'm surprised that you called. I thought you didn't really have very much to say to me. Yeah, well, I was in the middle of a 24-hour silent meditation. -I didn't. -How am I supposed to know you're in a silent meditation if you can't tell me? I mean, isn't it a law you're supposed to wear a sign or something? -[laughs] -Well, now that you can talk, do you have good news? Yeah. Does it involve an upgrade in our date night? -Maybe. -Good, 'cause I still want to take you out, but I want to take you out in Paris. [laughs] Okay. Can I call you back later to talk about it? Sure. -I like you. -I like you, too. [sighs] Well, I guess we are, uh... We're gonna go to France to make a movie, yeah? -Yes! -Don't do that. -What? -No, don't do it. -Yes! -No, I mean it. Do not do it. No, no, seriously. Do not do it.
