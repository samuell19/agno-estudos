The service, huh? Yeah. Navy? No, I was in the Corps. That's the service, aint it? Yeah. Well, I'll tell you something. After you've been on this job for after awhile you get to spot things like that. Well, you got a lot to learn and I'm here to tell you. See them guys back there? Three of them monkeys have been with us before. Hey, Steve! What? What did you bring? One to five. Thought you had enough. It's enough. He's a tough kid. See that little kid back there? I wouldn't be in his shoes for nothing. We got us a college professor. We got a college professor back there. Paige! Johnathon page, get on your feet! All rise. This court is now in session. Murder. Murder? College professor. Ladies and gentlemen of the jury, have you reached a verdict? We have, your honor. Hey, Paige, sit down! Let them chips fall where they may. Irregardless of where they may. Irregardless. Joint's a can of worms. I don't even know why I work there. I know why I work there, I got possessions. You got possessions? No. Worst thing to ever happen to a guy is get possessions. Payments on TV, car, kids eat like crocodiles. They don't even let the littlekids pray in schools anymore. Riots in the street. Anarchy. The honorable Thomas Morahan presiding. The defendant will rise. Will the foreman hand the verdict to the bailiff? What is your verdict? Guilty or not guilty? We find the defendant guilty of manslaughter. Johnathon Paige, you have been found guilty and convicted of manslaughter. All right, you outlaws, come on. Give them a hand so they don't slip. All right, come on, let's go. Straight on through, come on. Give me your hands. What are you in for this time, Hennessy? Same old stuff. Same old stuff, nevermind. All right, come on. Lean back just a little bit. Right there. Turn your head this way just a little bit. Okay right there, look at me. Lean back just a little bit, right there. Hold it. That way and turn left. Come on down their trousers and up their legs, like that. Okay, you wanna do it to me? Yeah. What about glasses? Glasses are all right. Fine. It's too small. Here's your pants too. These have to last you for nine months. I know, I know. What size shorts? Small. And trousers? 33. What size you wear? Oh, 15. And pants? 34. 34 waist. You get three sets but they gotta last you nine months. So take care of them because there's no excuses. Try to fit them tight so they can't compress their hands and get out of them. Any questions? What can I say? This is the standard Ithaca riot weapon. Shoots 12 gage buck shot. Effective about 50 to 75 yards. Never point these at anyone. Unless you're ready to use them. This is a fine example of handy craft. This little plate that was across here, the officer in the shakedown picked the boat up and that fell off and here's a complete narcotic set. Syringe, needle. T. O. Z. D. F. E. T. O. I do solemnly swear that I will support, obey and defend the Constitution of this state. That I will discharge the duties of my office with fidelity. I do. You gotta be a shark to survive in this joint or they eat you alive. But the thing that gets to me the most are these bleeding heart politicians. They come around here, they wanna know what's happening. So who do they go to? They go to the cons. They aint gonna tell them nothing. If they do tell them something, it'd be a bunch of lies. They wanna know what's happening, they oughta talk to the guards. The guards will tell them. You talk to me, I'll tell you what's happening. What's the man like? He's all right. Well, he's kinda lost control around here but he used to run this place like a machine. We had some discipline. He's on short times, he'll retire soon. Oh, yes. You can go in now. He just doesn't want to make any waves. Sir, John Courtland. He's had the tour? Yes, sir. And the armory, he knows where it is? Yes, sir. Now get acquainted with your different bails and know what they mean. And you understand that at no time will you be permitted to carry firearms while in population? That was explained to me, yes sir. If you are ever taken hostage, the official position is you're a dead man. Yes, sir. We won't bargain. Coffee? No, sir. Yes, sir, I believe I will, thank you. You know, in actuality, the residents can take hostages anytime they want. They've got the manpower. They outnumber us six to one. You want sugar? No, sir, I'll take it straight. Thank you. This has been my place of business, well, going on 30 years now. I suppose after a time it tends to callus you a bit. But it's a job, Officer Courtland. I know it can be a very good one. Now, I see here you had a tour in Vietnam. Yes, sir. Whatever made you decide on corrections as a career? When I was in Saigon I pulled down two months brig duty in a stockade there and I saw a couple of things, I don't know, it didn't add up to me, so I just thought I'd take a shot here. I'd really like to know, Officer Courtland, why. Well, things are tight and I couldn't find anything else. But the other stuff's true, it's true. In a way, this has been a rewarding life. I think I've made a few good decisions. And who knows, maybe one day you, yourself, will be sitting behind this very desk. Officer Courtland. I wanna welcome you aboard. Thank you. Good luck to you, now. Thank you, sir. Two months brig duty. He'll get the hang of it. That new prisoner, Johnathan Paige, he's a college professor? Yes, sir, manslaughter. He seems like a clean type, straight. Great, great, that's fine. I want him in the pharmacy. Sir? I want Professor Paige behind that counter. Sir, that's a very difficult spot to put a new man in. You just said yourself that he was straight, didn't you? Yes, sir. I want Professor Paige in the pharmacy, Officer Brown. Yes, sir. All right, fish, down the stairs, turn left. Fresh meat! Here they come, fresh pickin'. Okay, home sweet home, that's what it says right here. Wait a minute, wait a minute. Paige? Campbell? Cell 131, ground floor. Wait a minute. Get your toilet paper and your soap right just in there. Okay. Paige, cell 129, ground floor. Berinie, 120-- Berino. Berino, 125, ground floor. Cellblock classification. Cellblock classification. Harold Campbell, Donald Simpson. Robert Mulland, mail room. Robert Mulland, mail room. Ajax has got the fish list. What's happening with the kid? The kid, his name is Allan Campbell, he's doing five to life for pushing grass. I don't care what he's in for. Steve-O's back. Didn't take him long, did it? Three weeks. What are you laughing about? This could happen to you. What's that, smart? We got us a professor in today. Professor. Probably a fag. Maybe he's a lawyer. A lawyer? I'm through with a lawyer, what I need is a judge. He teaches. Teaches what? Political science. Mhmm. Political science. He's a honky, man. He got a brain. I wanna take a look at his record. All will be delivered then, man. Hey. Get over here! What's the story on Brown? He needs another week, Hugo. That's all. I'm positive he's gonna-- Tell him he's got three days to ante up the bread. He's losing his touch. What do you mean you know my old lady? Where do you know my old lady from? Well, man, I was out there and you was in here. It's all right, it's all right. They can handle it. Out there's where the action is. Saved a place for you. Hey, sit down, sit down. Best seat in the house. Oh, thank you very much. Bunch of crumbs in here, you know? Really. Nice to break bread with a real boss for a change. This food's good tonight, do you know that? Yeah, looks good. Hey, you know what they tell me? Tell me you're a... PhD, right? PhD? Yeah, PhD. Wow, I really could use a guy with that talent. Bowl of chili. Forget the onions! Them onions, giving me ulcer. Hey, do you want any? No, thank you very much. My names Hugo Slocum. Johnathon Paige. Let me clue you in to something. Professor, in here you can have... You can have like three thousand PhDs, they don't mean nothing. Nothing, you're dog meat just like the rest of these cons. Especially, you don't know nothing. You don't know yet, you know? So maybe, maybe we can kinda help each other out. That's interesting. See, I'm tuned into this joint. Want a cigarette? No, thank you, I don't smoke. See now, that's your first mistake. When I offer you something for free, you take it. Come on, take it. Thank you very much. Let me clue you into something, professor. Light this, will you? There's two kinds of times that you can do in here, you know? Good, bad. Depending. Like take that hassle that just happened over there. You know, that fight? Okay. One of them guys, he's gonna get cut. It happens everyday. There are shives all over this place. This is nice. I'm enjoying your company, you know that? You know, I can get you a little soft job here. One of my associates can fix you. Hey, Professor, I don't think you've been listening to me. What I'm trying to say is that I can make things easier for you, you know? I really appreciate your offer, Mr. Slocum, but I think I'll pass on it. Let me tell you something else. This is very important, you listen now. Say you're walking down the corridor, right? Any corridor, the whole joint. Yeah? And you bump into a guy, you know? Boom. Accident. Doesn't have to be boom, it could be boom. Little. You better apologize. Your life might depend on it. Then, after you apologize, they're gonna cut you up anyway. See? Yeah. It'd be a shame to see a guy with your talents go to waste, you know? You know, everybody's gotta bring their tray back clean. Why don't you finish up Hugo's food for him? He'll appreciate it. Eat up. And you owe Slocum five cartons, right? We gave you three weeks, before that we gave you three weeks. Now where the hell are they? Three weeks, Sunday. Look, it was three weeks Thursday. Don't jab with me. You owe those guys. Look, I want them fast or I'm gonna open you up like a pig and there'll be steaks all over the floor. Now come on! Straighten it up with Slocum, I'll give you seven. He's been all over my neck! Come on! Hey, man, come here. Ajax, come here! What do you got there? I've got nothing there. Let me see. I haven't got anything. You've got a shank. I have not got a shank. Hey man, you wanna go to max? Better talk to Slocum. Hey, Courtland. You have a little problem here? Yeah, he's got a shank. I don't. All right, all right. I'll take care of it. Now beat it. Fish bowl. It's nothing. Well, only two thousand, nine hundred and 72 days to go. Ugh. What are you in for? Do you really wanna know? Yeah, if you wanna tell me. It was a bum rap. That's that. No, no, I'll tell you, I'll tell you. It's a good story. I was gonna go over to see my girlfriend. I was gonna walk over. She lives on the other side of town, right? I thought I'd walk my dog too and I took a little grass along with me just to, you know, keep things friendly. So we're walking across town, right, and my dog stops to do his thing and I look next to me and I see there's these two people having this business transaction, you might call it. Well, suddenly! Two thousand cops are surrounding us. We're pinned up against the wall and they're patting us down and I'm just saying, "Listen, I'm just walking my dog." So they put me in the can. That really happen? Some of it. Boy. Sure would be nice to have a guitar in here. Wouldn't it be nice to have a guitar? Do they let you bring a guitar in here? I don't know. They let us wear long hair. Hugo Slocum, he could get a guitar. Hugo Slocum? You don't know. I'm working for him now. I'm one of his runners. You're kidding. No. No, isn't that terrific? Everything's really gonna be fine. I don't think it's a good thing. I think it's dumb. Sometimes you amaze me. I mean, did you see the faces of those guys when I came in here? Man, I need someone to protect me around here. Listen, I don't wanna tell you what to do, but I think that's a big mistake. I think that's a very big mistake. Well, we'll discuss it later, all right? Hey, listen, now that I'm a heavyweight around here, a criminal type, if you want anything, just let me know, okay? Yeah. Think it over. Douglas Havelock, Allan McCoy, Captain's office. Douglas Havelock, Allan McCoy. Hey. Hear you're a pill-pusher. Got that job in the pharmacy, huh? Yeah. Well this is the guy that you took his job away. They put him to work in the laundry. I didn't know that, I'm sorry. Well, he knows the ins and outs of the job, so if you got any questions, why don't you ask him? He knows how it works and once in awhile, Ajax, here, will be coming through. There will be an envelope underneath the counter. Just makes sure he gets it. Some joker put Sinclair out of business. That's not my problem, Hugo. Maybe. Games, games, games. Got a letter from my wife today. Did you get any mail? Sometimes it's harder getting mail than not getting it. Writes to let me know what's happening with our kid and keeps me up-to-date on our friends. I hear these guys talking and I've heard so many guys say that they've lost their family since they came here. Hey. Listen, you're only in here for a year. Then you can go back to teaching and your wife and your kid. It's kinda like a paid vacation. A sabbatical, huh? Yeah. Hey. What's it like working with Slocum? Straight and narrow. Yeah, all right, I won't give you any advice. Hey, listen, I'm gonna give you some advice. Oh yeah, what? Don't get depressed. I guess we'll be working together. Uh huh. My name's Johnathon Paige. Mhmm. What's your name? Why? Well, no particular reason, I guess. Well, if you have to have a name, it's Lennox. Lennox, okay. Morning. Let's see what you got there. Okay. There you are. What's happening? Come on in. Lie down, I'll give you something to put in your eye. Okay, there you go. There you are. Here you go. Okay, my man. Okay, there you are. Okay. There you go. You know what you're doing, man? Yeah, I think so. I know what I'm not gonna do. That thing you did with Ajax sure took a lot of style. I'm gonna tell you something. It's not gonna end there. Sooner or later, you're gonna have to answer to some people. That's too bad. Could've been a walkthrough, you just had a year. How do you know that? Read your file. Oh, you did? Mhmm. Was it interesting? Not too much. Take my file, maybe one, two inches thick. Starts at age nine. Some heavy, heavy stuff. There aren't any secrets in here, Paige. So I'm beginning to see. What'd you say you teach? You read my file. That's too bad. You could've done easy time. How goes the battle? Getting the hang of it? Yes sir, I think so. It's okay. A lot of routine, you know. So far, routine. Knock on wood. Well, we didn't promise adventure or travel. No, sir. It's a job, Courtland. It's a job like any other. I don't know, I tell you, I get to thinking, seven out of ten of these guys come back in here, isn't that right? That's the figure? Seven out of ten of them? Well, that's not right. Man, that's a bad scene. Seems to me like something, somewhere, along the line is not working. You're not gonna change anything, Courtland. Half these guys are nuts anyhow. This is dynamite looking for a fuse. These blacks aren't criminals anymore. They're revolutionary martyrs. They hate you because you put them inside. The white cons, it's the same thing. Now don't let yourself get soft. This bunch of animals in here will eat you alive. How about you and the little lady coming over for dinner next week? Oh, I'm not married. I don't have a wife, Captain. Married your career, huh? No, I had a wife. We split up, I got a divorce. Well the invite still holds for yourself. Thank you, sir, appreciate it. A little bit of love so that we can understand that definition. A lot of people throw "love" around. They talk about it, they give definition, but they don't even understand what it's about. I learned something that love comes in many ways. Yeah, right. Love can be a hard motherfucker too. An old man once said to me, he said, "It aint how many times you fall down that counts. "It's how many times you get up." How you doing, Professor? Fine. Hey, kid, when your finish your chow, come on over to my house. I got something for you. You bet, chief. Well, I better get going. Hey, come on. What the hell are we gonna do about Paige? I stood in the line, he looks at me, I look at him. I coulda stayed there all bloody day. I mean, us guys, we need this. Hey, hey, kid, come on to my house. Sit down, sit down. Bet you're wondering what I got for you, huh? Huh? Watch this. The hand is quicker than the eye. Watch this, kid. Look at that. Look at the wood, feel the wood. All yours, kid. Hey, Hugo, what're we gonna do about Paige? We'll take care of him later. You didn't have to do this. Isn't that lovely, huh kid? Yeah, it's really nice. I know you're still new here, you're still a pinky. Pretty soon you're gonna find out that there's only a few things Hugo Slocum can't get in this prison. Like one's a helicopter. And the other one's a woman. Hey, you want some cake? Look what I got here. Look at this cake. Isn't that nice, huh? - You want some? - No. Hey! Is it your birthday? Look at this. Look, anything in this prison you want, you just let me know, I can get it for you. Anything. Oh yeah, what about grass? Grass. Grass. Mary-jo-wanna? You better believe it. I can even get the angels to put a little dust on it, you know? Why don't you play me a little something? Oh yeah, sure. Let me just get it tuned up first, okay? Is that how your tune it up? Hey, look, look, just relax. Nobody's gonna hurt you, kid. You know what I hear? I hear that you wanna get into the machine shop. Right? Yeah. I can fix it for you, just like that. It's that easy. I know you've been doing little things for me, you know, but you haven't been doing enough. In here you're gonna need my protection. With me around, you got no worries, you know? Yeah, I think that's true. It's just that I don't know what else I can do for you. Look, kid, I don't think you get my message. I say that you need protection because this is a jungle here, see? There's a lot of animals out there just waiting to grab a kid like you, you know? Hey! What's the matter with you? You wanna be fair game? I like you, kid. It's either me... or everybody. Punk. As long as I live, I'll never understand why a man would want to do that for a living. I swear, I don't. Can't do anything else, that guy. Fish bowl. The same as all the others. Cons, guards, can't tell the difference after awhile. How long are you in for? All my life, one ghetto to another. This time I drew an indeterminate sentence. A friend of mine down in Mississippi brought 19 hundred years. You're kidding. Nope. At least he knows what he got. You know, I spent my life writing checks to make the world better, you know what I mean? And passing out petitions and going to meetings. I'm not ready for this. I can't do my own time. Everybody's hustling me, everybody's after me, everybody's doing a con. The whole thing's a big game. It's a system. That's how it gets you down. You know, I think you haven't been around a lot of hard drugs before. Well, in here, that's how a lot of guys get through the day. That what makes Slocum king. Gives him power. He has control on the floor. What you did was stop him. What I did? Mhmm. Listen, what do you want? What're you saying? You know, everybody wants something. The whole place wants something. They're all hustling. From the warden on down. I'm not gaming you, Paige. What I want is these men to realize their value as individuals and as human beings. That's all you want? Look, I'm no Slocum because I'm political. That's something he'll never understand or the warden neither. Because they're both part of this system and I'm gonna change that system, baby. You wanna know why? Because I'm in here for life, forever, and I got nothing to lose. You keep the junk out of Slocum's pipeline and he'll dry up. He'll be ripped off by his own punks. And then what? What do you mean? It's a funny thing about change, everything seems to stay the same. What's to prevent you from taking over? You know, I thought you could dig on what I was saying. But you're no different from any of them. Hmm. I'm not gonna make it. You all right? I mean, do you need anything? Is it terrible? No, it's okay. Oh God, I miss you so much. Let me have-- Cigarettes. What? Buy cigarettes. Oh yeah. Can I have two cartons of those there? Yeah and one of those. Right. Thanks. All right, got the cigarettes. Now what? Thanks. Hey, wait. What do I do now? What? What do I do? You're paying Hugo back. What do you mean I'm paying Hugo back? What I mean is you owe him eight more cartons. Eight? What are you talking about? Why do I owe eight for? For the guitar. For the guitar? He didn't say anything about that. He didn't? No, I don't have any bread. Well I don't know anything about that. Bree said I owe you eight cartons. Yeah, that's right. That's the way Sinclair figured, isn't it? That's right, eight cartons. Bree didn't rough you up, did he? No. Then what's your beef? No one told me. No one told him. Look kid, there's no problem. Forget the smokes. In here, cigarettes mean money, but money isn't everything. I'll let it slide because I like you. Hey, wait a minute, Hugo. You guys wise? Nobody asked you. I'll tell you what, I'll get you the rest of your cigarettes. Too bad. Nice kid. Hello, Professor. You play ping-pong? No, I don't. If I get any good out of it, they'll send me to China. I thought I could talk to you. If you got a minute. A minute? Yeah, I got a lot of time. I wanna talk to you too, why don't you step into my office? Look, it's about Allan. About Allan? Yeah. He's all right, he's been taken care of. He's a good kid. Yeah, well, I just think he's a very naive kid. I think he can leave this place pretty much the same way he was when came in if he's given the chance. Professor, you know who you sound like? Sound like one of them case workers, you know? No, I'm just concerned about him, that's all. You sound like one of them case works, so why don't you handle my case? I don't know what you mean. You're working in that pharmacy and I want you out. Why don't you tell the warden? I'm telling you. See, Sinclair, I mean, it's not nice. He's going fruity working in that laundry room. He doesn't get his coffee in the morning. That disturbs him. Ajax? Isn't that right? Doesn't Sinclair miss his coffee in the morning? That's what he said. Just what I'm telling you. It's like I told you the other day in the corridor, I want Sinclair out of that laundry room and back into the dispensary. Yeah but I can't help that. Look, do I talk funny or something? You understand me? Yeah, I understand you. I don't talk to fast for you, do I? No, no, I understand you. I just hope that I can make myself clear. Look, I can have you cut right now and you'll be dead before you hit the floor. Happens that quick. You wouldn't have the chance to say bye-bye. It's amazing, Professor. There aint no place in here you can get away from me. I don't care if you go to chapel, your got to the can, I'll get you. So don't you mess with me. From now on, you handle my case, you got that? Beat it. Beat it. Hey, Paige. I'll see you. Walk straight ahead. You better watch yourself, Paige. Things got a way of happening around here. So I've heard. What're you looking at? Nothing, I wasn't looking at you. What're you looking at? I saw you staring. I wasn't looking at you. I'm sorry if I was staring. Hold it, Paige. Just hold it. Look, I didn't mean anything by it. I want you to do me a favor. A favor? You're a teacher, right? Yeah. Read my book. Did you write this? Yeah. It's a book for kids. What made you decide to write a book for children? I used to have a daughter. Used to? What do you mean? Your wife leave you when you came here? I don't know. Hey, look, I know it's got bad spelling but maybe if you read it over for me and if you know somebody on the outside, you can get it published? Did you do these drawings? Yeah. How long you been working on this? About three years. Yeah, three years. You must have something going for you if you can do this. Why do you let Slocum push you around like that? Hey, that's none of your business. Get your head together. I'm sorry I asked you to read my book. Wait a minute, what're you getting so excited about? Listen, you know, you can get wasted in here. Who turned off that tune? It's the professor. He oughta know better than that. Turn it back on. You don't go around just changing things. Sorry, I didn't know anybody was watching. Well don't ever do that again. I didn't know, all right? Hey, let me go. Hey, Professor. Just cut it out! Cut it out! Cut that out! Just take it easy. All right, I'll take it easy, you take it easy! Just relax! Cut it out! Just relax, okay? Take it easy. Get back in your house. Yeah, just relax. Let go of me, will you? Relax. Get in. I think somebody's gonna get dusted, sir. Oh? Yes, sir, and I think it's possible there will be more than one of them. I get that kind of news everyday. Yeah. Yes, sir, I know you do. But it's the tension, I've been watching. It's the tension down in C-block, it's been building up to a point where I think if think something isn't done-- If something isn't done, what? Prisoners sometimes carry grudges for years and then suddenly, one becomes a dead body. If I tried to follow up every little fracas I wouldn't have time for anything else. Not if it's only just suspicion-- No, sir, it's not just suspicion. I think you oughta move Paige to another block. Take him out of C-block. I think you also oughta move him out of the pharmacy. Another block wouldn't make a bit of difference and I want him in the pharmacy. Warden, I'm telling you, Solcum is gonna have somebody-- Don't try to tell me my job, Officer Courtland, I've dealt with such situations as this every day for years now. You're fooling around with a man's life here. We've learned through experience it's sometimes better to let certain given situations adjust themselves. File a report, if you must. Anybody home? Oh, hi Hugo. Hi. Missed you today. Oh, I wanted to work on my book. Oh, well that's all good and fine but you're supposed to pick up that envelope from Brown. Oh. I forgot. Yeah, that's what the boys have been saying. You've been forgetting a lot of things, you know? I'm sorry, Hugo, listen I'll get on Brown's-- No, no, no, don't sweat it. We passed it down already. Believe me, Hugo, I'm sorry. I know, you're working on your book, right? Yeah, that's right. Speaking about your book, Sinclair, I understand you had a friendly chat with the Professor in the library. No, no. Don't give me that. No. Don't give me that! What were you talking about? Nothing, Hugo. You were supposed to lay on him and get him out of that pharmacy. I just asked him to read my book. I wanted him to check the spelling, Hugo. Check the spelling? Yeah, that's all, that's all. Oh. So he was helping you with this, huh? Yeah, that's right. I'll murder you. I got others to take your place. Secure! Secure it! Hey, kid. Hi. Hey. How bad, kid? You know, I could kill you right now? I know. You're a boy, aren't you? You're a sinner before God or you wouldn't be here. You know, I could squeeze the life right out of you with one hand. I've done it before. Do you believe me when I tell you I could kill you? I'm scary, aint I? But you know, you just don't wanna mess with me ever since I turned to God. Kid, I know you got a lot of things hitting on you at once. But there are rules. Now Hugo don't want you dead but you gotta understand that he does mean business. Is that the one? Just like Slocum said. Not a feather on him. No! No! No, please! No! No! Please! No! No! No! Hey. Can I get you something? Look, just hang on, okay? Look, it doesn't make any difference what happened. You're still a man. You're still the same person you were when you came here. Go away, please. I got it. Guard room, Brown. Okay. A flyer in C-block. Come on, jump! Fly, baby! Allan, don't! Hey, stop! I don't care what happened. It's not bad enough to make you wanna die. Come on. Come on. Oh, God! God! God! Oh, Jesus Christ. Oh, Jesus. Oh, Jesus. Oh, Jesus. Paige. Let's go back down. Come on. Let's go back down. Come on. Get your hands off me! He's wiped out, man, you can't do anything now. You can't do a thing. Let's you and me go back downstairs. That kid's gone. Go on. Paige. I can bust this thing wide open in writing. I don't know what you're talking about, I'm sorry. What do you mean? Look, Paige, let's just say I'm Slocum's accountant. Yeah? Eight years he kept a record. All down, every detail. Do you have guards in this? Got all the names. Brown. Eight years is a lot of ground to cover. You know the right people, we'll nail this guy. Who knows about this book? Slocum. Me. Ajax. Now you. I don't understand something. Why are you doing this now? Listen, Paige, I'm dead. Who's got the book? It's yours right now. ♪ Soldiers ♪ ♪ Marching as to war ♪ ♪ With the grace of Jesus ♪ ♪ Going on before ♪ ♪ Christ, the royal master ♪ ♪ Lead against the foe ♪ Listen, I gotta ask your help in something. Is that right? I gotta get something out of there, to the outside. Do you know how to do that? Yeah, I know how to get something out of here but why should I help you? Because it's very important. What do you wanna do? Send a letter out to your old lady or something? No, no. It's important to you too. What is it? I can't tell you what it is. I can't. It's something written. I know what it is. And if you wanna get Slocum, this is how you do it. Bullet, trigger, boom. I can't do that. Anyway, I don't wanna get Slocum. You don't even know what's happening, man. All you got to back you up. If that's what you want, why don't you do it? We could start a war, baby. Let me tell you one thing. If you wanna get Slocum off your back, you better get something. You understand? I can't help you, man. They got everybody checked out. They got everybody checked out. They got a dossier on everybody in this country, man. When a black man, I know this guy, his mother was working for the CIA. Boo. Get the hell out of here, will you? Whatever you gonna do with Solcum's book, you better do it fast. Fast, baby. Come on, hurry. Grab them rugs and stuff and get out. Hurry. Not there. I want my book. No. Open the gate! Open the gate! Help! Help! Help, for God sake! Help! I'll take that book. The hell you will. Well, you've been baptized. Congratulations. Welcome to the club. Too bad about the PhD. Paige. Johnathon Paige. It's amazing how many problems got solved yesterday. Here it is. Yeah, I read that. I read that. I know you read it. I need your signature. There's a lot missing in here, sir. This is the official version, Courtland. Nothing I reported is in here. A convict died yesterday in a racial flare-up. No. A race riot, pure and simple. Happens all the time. No, no, sir. That is not the way this was. You're the one that came in on the tail end of it. This office, that's all the facts. There was a power play. Look, I submitted Slocum's book for proof. What book? The handwritten notebook with the names and bribes, that's what the hell it was all about, warden. There is no book, Officer Courtland. Not gonna do it. I won't sign your paper. I won't sign your statement. No one is forcing you to sign. I'm only presenting you with the smoothest way to explain your killing of a prisoner. Officer Brown has already been severely reprimanded for gross negligence of duty. Oh boy. You see, you're still too inexperienced to grasp all of the ramifications, Courtland. Our duty is to keep things from bubbling over, from exploding. That is, Warden, that's just a bunch of crap! Your joint's exploding right now, you don't even know it. And if you do know it, you don't even know why. There are panels, Courtland. Panels and boards. And we have to answer to them. And the senators and the human right groups. And left-wingers and right-wingers. And death penalty and no death penalty. Kill the prisoners, let the prisoners go free. Sorry, no more money. I'm not in love with this system but it's all they've got and it's better than having no system at all. No. No, I'm gonna tell this story. I'm gonna tell it. Officer Courtland, you will be on your own. Absolutely alone. That's all right. I wouldn't have it any other way. Courtland?
