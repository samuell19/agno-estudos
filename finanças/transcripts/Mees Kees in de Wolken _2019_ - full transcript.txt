Bye mom. See you later! Tobias! Sep! Come on! Quick! Good morning, Mrs. Dreus. Guys, here! Did you bring it? Come on, let's go! Aukje? Do you know where everybody... I thought you were Auke from my class... Surprise! Happ/ blrthda/ to /ou... MISTER TWISTER IN THE CLOUDS A self-made friendship book. We are all in it. How beautiful. Let me take a look. Manon's favorite is a... pony, of course. Jacky's favorite color is... yellow, nice. Tom likes numbers. That is great. Tobias's best friend is Sep and... Very nice! The best birthday present ever. But I have something for you too! A very special food project, with... Ice slices! And whipped cream! And hats. A hat for everyone. All right, guys. And there is also another project. Without whipped cream, but just as fun. Today we will start... a timeline project about your own life. Look. This will be a project about your own history. You start with your birth. Look... Here. And then you continue by adding everything you have been through on your timeline. Here we moved to the house I live in now, I was four years old. When I was twelve, we got Harley. Of course there is a lot you can mark. But you end at... today. In my case on my birthday, here. Does it also mention eating your pastry? I can help you with that. Watch me... Casey, Casey, Casey... Mister Casey! I can hear all of you down the hall. What on earth is going on? Is it your birthday? Yes... And we just started a new project. Well, congratulations... But... That's not why I came. Can I speak to you privately? Mister Casey, there is a party coming up! What fun...for me? Mister Casey, don't be daft. For the school. - Of course, I surmised as much and... It is the school's 50th anniversary... and that deserves to be celebrated. A classy party with beautiful dresses and slick suits. In style like parties were 50 years ago. Nice. 'Nice' doesn't begin to describe it. It is formidable! A party presents also a learning experience. The perfect ambiance to acquire social skills. How to address a person? How to ask someone to dance? How to keep a conversation going... with someone who is has not that much topics of conversation as yourself? Very difficult. All pupils must ask someone to come along. And you need make sure the class is well prepared. Because fifty years... Fifty years... isn't peanuts! A party in honor of the 50th anniversary. 50 is a great number. It is also an easy number. 2 times 50 is 100. 3 times 50 is 150. A date and a dance... I am all in for it. 10 times 50 is 500. You will have to wear a suit. How old fashioned! 18 times 50... Sep, who are you going to ask? It is between Manon... Lisa or Jacky. You know what, I will ask them all. That is what I was going to do. You can take Hasna. I don't have a suit... - It is fun. Just ask her. Tobias! I'm here to get Casey for his birthday party. You are coming too, right? Really? Can I come? - Of course, what did you think? A little more, Casey. Stretch out a little. Mom, I can't do this. - Of course you can! Mom, I can't do this. - Yes, you can. A little higher. I really can't reach any further. - Yes you can, stretch those arms. Come on. I would have done it myself. But my leg still hurts sometimes, so Casey has to go up the ladder. Even though he has fear of heights. Mom, hold the ladder! - Yes, yes... Come, Casey. Come on, a little bit further. You can do it. Yes, yes, yes... Yes. I will be happy when I don't have to climb that ladder anymore. But well, it will have to come off some time. I'll help you, Mister Casey. Really? That would be very... Hi, Casey! Marie-Louise! How nice. How very nice your class did this for you. It is, they made it by hand themselves. - With the entire class. I too have a little present. Here. Wow. An envelope! The present is in it. - Oh, right... Nice. A balloon ride! We will be going in a balloon together. Well, say something. Great... Gee, I like it very much. Look Tobias, how fabulous! Very good. Yes, this way. This way, very good. And stop! Yes, exactly right. Mister Casey, Mister Hank. Pull up your sleeves. Well, everything that's in here, inside. Everything. Alright guys, I'll take the heavy one. You take something light. Mister Hank, I am so pleased at your effort. Of course Mrs. Dreus. Just a couple of beams. But I was wondering, do you have a suit? Not one of those tracksuits like you are wearing now, but a real suit. It is important, Mister Hank. A good suit. A decent suit. The children look up to us, of course, and a decent suit, well cut is important. Well cut, yes. Will you pay attention to this, Mister Hank? I prefer an Italian suit. Italian... - But that can be tight. Perhaps you should go for another type of suit. Mister Hank, those workmen are shifting their second load. This is no way to get it done if you keep talking about your suit. Hurry on up. Inside. Very good, come. This way. Mister Casey too. Great, very well! And now around the corner. Very good. Pay attention to these gentlemen. And straight in, Mister Hank. Perfect. Put it down. Are you renovating Mrs. Dreus? New office? Yes Mister Hank, wouldn't you want to know? I am going to organize a surprise in here, for the 50th anniversary of the school. And I don't need peeping Toms. A surprise? - Golly, with all that timber? She is building a cupboard. I can see that: Mrs. Dreus thinks that is a great gift. A cupboard? - Or a bench, or something. It gets stranger every time at this school. Mrs. Dreus wants no peeping Toms. Ask her now. No man, but how? Well, like this... Hey Jacky, would you like to go to the party with me? Yes, sure. - Great! Like this. Now you. Oh no... Not now. Are you OK? Not really... What is the matter! Look, I got this from Marie Louise for my birthday. A balloon ride. But I can't do it. Such a balloon goes really high and... I don't even wanna go up a ladder. When you are afraid of something, you can reduce that by taking small steps at a time. Small steps? - That's how it works with fear. You need to get yourself used to that which frightens you... until you are no longer scared. But how? Do you really think this works? Sure does. Today a tree... and tomorrow climbing a rope in the gym, or climb a church tower. That is maybe a bit too high. A balloon goes higher, Mister Casey. If you compare the temperature of the air in the balloon to the cold air outside it... Tom! Come on down, Mister Casey. It is no crime to be afraid. I am afraid of spiders. I just walk the other way. I am afraid to stroke cats, Mister Casey. - I am afraid of doing presentations. And I am afraid of lightning. - Me too! I mean, I don't! Well yes, I do. Actually I am afraid to dance at the party. I can't dance. Me too. I am also afraid to do that. - So am I. Me too, Mister Casey. - Me too, actually. Me too. - Me too... Gosh, so the dancing at the party is posing a problem. Mister Casey! What business cannot wait for you to disturb me here? Well, I wanted to talk to you about the party, because the class asked me... Step back, please! Perhaps it's possible if we... Mister Casey. This is not the right place to speak. Go back to your class! You can come along now! You had better put on overalls too. Look at you. This is out of line. Have you fallen out of a tree? No, I actually climbed a tree. Mister Casey, I am in no mood for jokes. This is too scruffy. You are expected to show up in a quality suit. What was so important? Ah yes, the party. Some tension has arisen with reference to the dancing bit. Tension? - Yes. The children are not looking forward to it. They are a little frightened even. So I hoped that we could discuss this. It is highly commendable that you ascertain these things and put them on the agenda. I shall take my time to reflect on it, but I will find a solution. Dancing will not be a problem much longer. Really? - Really. Don't you worry. Guys. - Mister Casey! What is in the blinded classroom of Mrs. Dreus? What is she making? Gee, Sep. I didn't ask about that. But I did talk to her about the dancing. And I guess the problem is nearly solved. Mrs. Dreus is going to think about it. It will be something like: those who want to dance, can dance... and those who don't, can sit to the side and watch. The windows are blinded. Even the door is locked. Look at you! She could be making a hen house, so we will keep chicken in school. Or a giant rocket. - Made of wood? Or she is making a stage. For me! A stage just for, Sep. It is possible, dad. This is the one! This is the perfect suit! You look great in that suit, Casey. - It belonged to my father. A party? - The school celebrates its 50th anniversary. We are quite busy with that. Well, it is also... why I had no time to respond to your gift. We will take care of that right now. I have my agenda with me. I will get mine too. Hey, Tobias! Let's just get you a suit. Now we are here. I will pay! I will buy a round of suits. For you two. No need. - Sure? If it doesn't work out... you know where to find me. Do you really have a suit? - It will be alright. Sure? It will be alright, Sep. A date for the balloon ride. - I am really looking forward to it. How about next Wednesday? I guess I got my study day then, I think. I'd really like to know what you think of it. I have done it before and it was very special. So high above the world. All alone, hanging in such a tiny basket. I would love to experience that with you. How about that Friday, is that possible? No, I have to help my mother in the garden. How about Saturday? - Hairdresser. Casey... Sunday? Then I need to take Harley to the groomer. The Wednesday after? = Oops, no can do. Friday? - Nope. Saturday. - Very busy days. You know... I... That balloon... What do you think? - Wow, mom... I've been dreaming of such a wagon for years. - It is stunning. Is the hose still functioning? - But of course. And so is the ladder. If we have a fire in the attic, I will roll everything out. Look. - Wow. Great, isn't it? Have a look here. There is a loft bed inside and a hammock for Harley. For real? A dog hammock. When we go to France. Are you going to France with Harley? I am only saying. Maybe France, maybe Norway. You can come along too. You wanna go for a test ride? Can we? - Of course! Let's go. Let's go, Casey, are you coming? I still have to do something for school. Come on, Casey. - No, I have to finish it. Hey, Mister Casey. - Hi, Tobias. Harley... Wouldn't that be great if you could go as high as that little kite... and then look out over the world. - Yes... When is your air balloon ride? I do not know. I am just so anxious. And even worse... I am even afraid to admit that I don't have the courage to do it. I have the same thing. With Hasna. I can't find the courage to ask her to the party. You know what? Tomorrow we are going to break the deadlock. I set a date with Marie Louise... and you ask Hasna to the party. Come on, put it there! Deal. I scratched too hard. Right where... Well, you know. Where my father died. I think it is a difficult assignment. I should break mine in two also. But in the length. Then I will have one for the life with my mother and one for the life with my father. How bad is that? It just got complicated after their divorce. But not like you, well... What I was trying to ask you... - Can I ask you something? You go. No, you go. - OK. Tobias... Tobias! - Would you... Tobias, come! I found something. Come, I have to show you something. Come, I discovered something in Dreus' classroom. Mrs. Dreus is doing something. Something big. I discovered an open window. - Really? If we sneak in, we can see what she is up to. And then I know what she is making. Sep? Hello? Hello, is anybody out there? Mister Casey! Mister Casey! Mister Casey! Can I have a moment of your time in my office? It was a bit of a puzzle, but I have a solution to the problem of your class. Problem? - Your dancing problem. But didn't we already solve that? Dancing is voluntary and not obligatory. What? No way, Mister Casey. It is a party! The school's 50th anniversary. At such a party everybody dances. Everybody? - Everybody! It is evident! I have found a course book. A course how to dance! If the children know how to dance, they won't be afraid of it anymore. You can start with that. The Waltz, the Quickstep... the Rhumba, the Chachacha. One, two, cha cha cha. It's with pictures, so you will manage. But... - Rigorous practice! What is it, Mister Casey? Why don't you say something? Do you remember the dancing? It is obligatory after all. Seriously, Mister Casey? I guess I have made it worse by asking her about it. Now Dreus wants us to learn to dance by this book. Learn to dance by a book? That is utterly impossible. Maybe we shouldn't even try, Mister Casey. This is more complicated than mathematics. Hell no, it is not that difficult. You just have to go... like so... or... Place the included shoes in the right pattern... and start to dance. Let's make a circle. Chairs, tables, everything to the side. Put the shoes everywhere. Hey guys, guys. Mister Casey! I can hear you on the other side of the school! We are learning how to dance, using the book. This is nothing to do with dancing, this is utter chaos. Dance is the tender art of wooing. The art of rhythm and movement. The grace of the body on the dance floor. You have to take this very serious, Mister Casey. How will they be able to find their soulmates in the dancehalls of Europe later in life? They will do it all wrong. - Sorry, Mrs. Dreus. Learning to dance is a step by step process. That is why we begin simple. A chachacha, a waltz... That is very important, Mister Casey. Because even a simple little dance, may pave the way to romance! There is only one solution. I shall have to volunteer to do it myself. I'm not sure if we will make it out alive. At my other school we also had to learn how to dance. Every kid had at least twenty blisters. Really? Yes. It took the hospital an entire month to puncture all of them. At some point they ran out of needles. You're lying! I'm going to shove you! Ho, ho. Let's stop this! It's time for some dance lessons. Big circle, please. The Waltz, the perfect dance for a wonderful event such as our school party. Here's what we do. I now draw a real square. But you draw it in your head. Your feet stay within the square. Gracefully within the square. I'll show it to you. Slide and shuffle. Slide and shuffle... You can also cross. Cross and shuffle, cross... And again. And in pairs. Mister Casey, we will demonstrate. Look, she's grabbing Mister Casey! Mister Hank, could you please start the music. The play button is on the right. Listen to the music. One, two, three, one, two, three... Step, slide, close. Step, slide, close. Step, slide, close. Mister Hank, Mrs. Pauline! What are you waiting for? Dance! Gracefully... Gracefully. Think about your back. Gracefully, relaxed. Within the square. What I wanted to ask, about next week... Because you wanted to ask last week, but then Sep came... So... would you like to... Changez. Everybody change to a new partner. We will have to make the most of it, Tobias! I was planning to... - Here we go, let's dance! Perfect right? Skylights! And one of them is exactly above Dreus' classroom. One, two... three, four... Are you coming? Five... six, seven... eight. It can be anything, really anything. It could be a vessel full of foam for us to jump in... or an enormous cage to lock up our parents. I doubt that. It is of no importance what it is. It is important that we know! Nine, ten... This is it. Yes! Seppie the explorer. Seppie the superhero! You're right. No! It's all taped shut. Doesn't matter. Hey Marie-Louise, Casey not here yet? No, I have been here a while. - Funny, he should be home by now. Hey, what's wrong with you? Tobias? You know, I haven't spoken with Marie Louise about the balloon. Seriously? - No. I even sneaked away because she was waiting at my house to set a date. Mister Casey... I just didn't have the guts to go to her. I would have to admit that I'm afraid. Something has to change. I cannot keep running away from her forever. I have to accustom myself to heights. Just as Aukje said. I have to do it now. Now? - Yes. Now! From here you can see the cemetery. I put a cross. You put it where your father... - Yes. I will give you a new one in the morning. You can start over. However, you must make sure that that date with Hasna is going to happen. If you tell Marie Louise about your fear of heights. Deal. And you know, tomorrow instead of a cross you will put a... A heart. Yes, yes. A heart. I am going to do it! I am going to ask Hasna. Great! Are you asking Hasna? But she already has someone. That is what Winston said. He heard it from Karim and he got it from Jacky. She heard it from Manon... No, from Lisa, that I don't remember. No, it was Lisa. She told me she already had someone. Only a little bit more, Casey! You almost got it. Mom, it is very high. Come down then. I will do it. But mom, your leg is still hurting. - Quick, come on down. It is not even that high. It is not half as high as the ladder on my camper. When we go on a holiday... we will roll the ladder out, over a river... and then we jump. From the ladder into the water. Well? What do you think of that? How lovely! It sounds like fun. Hey, where is Casey? He was just here. - He was? Yes, he was holding the ladder. I think he has been avoiding me lately. No, dear. It may look that way. He must be upstairs. Let's have a look. What will you wear to the party? - I have no idea! I think something with fruit. - With fruit? I'm going to wear glitter. Hey, Tobias. It is not really important. You will just go alone. Or come with me and Jacky. We will go with the three of us. I am not that into the party. I might just stay home. I am guessing he had to go to the bathroom, or get something. Casey? Casey, are you there? Casey? Casey, open the door! He might have fainted. I will get a spare key. Casey! Casey, open the door! Please! I found the key! Casey, where are you! I don't understand. Ever since his birthday he has been this awkward.. Since his birthday? Did Casey ever tell you he is afraid of heights? Afraid of heights? Really? For years! That is why he is trying to avoid you. The balloon frightens him. Is that really so? Poor Casey. Hey dearest, party is coming, right? Why so gloomy? I don't have a suit. No suit, no entrance. Well, it can't be that harsh. It can. Of course not. You can take your dad's suit. Look, how beautiful. It's too big. Yes,just a tad. I was meaning to ask Hasna, but it didn't work out. The first time your dad asked me out didn't go to plan. He climbed a pear tree next to my house... and just when he wanted to knock on my window, he fell down. And then he asked me while he was lying in the grass with a sprained ankle. Sweet. Very sweet. Hey, it will work out. /d reall/ llke to know what /ou thlnk of It, So hlgh above the world, All alone, hanglng In such a tln/ basket, I would love to experlence that wlth /ou, Mrs. Dreus? Can I be of assistance? Yes, yes... Careful, Mister Casey. Many days and nights went into this piece of art. It is a fifty. - Well observed, Mister Casey. A very big fifty. Because the school has it's fiftieth anniversary. Is that not fitting? - Yes, I guess so. It's super big! Impressive right? Wait till it's unwrapped. And we also have... nice, educational gifts for the students. Because a birthday needs to be celebrated with gifts. Really nice. You understand that this must be a secret. My surprise for the school. I won't say anything, Mrs. Dreus. Promise. Well done. Can you get that corner? Because this has to go all the way to the gym. I mean dancehall of course. You must be looking forward to this. To dance around with your date tomorrow. I have to... I have to bring someone? Mister Casey, of course you have to bring someone. I wanted to, but... But I have a suit! - You know, Mister Casey. We have to make a virtue of necessity... and therefore you will accompany me to the party. We will be the first to go on the dance floor to give the good example. I can't wait until tomorrow. Empty. Now I will never know what Dreus has been up to. We will tonight. At the party. But I wanted to know sooner. Being the only one to know. Now I have to wait till tonight, just like everybody else. It's just not that important, Sep. - It is, these things are very important. I already marked the discovery of Dreus' secret on my timeline. Here, now I have to write that I had a banana for lunch or something. Is that the highlight of my life? A banana for lunch? Boys! Where are you? Come. Everybody has his or her timeline? - Yes! Your life so far. With the all the fun things. Bad things, happy things. And also the stupid things. Everything has been written down and been put on the timeline. And now... Now is the time to let it go in the wind. We let our timelines blow in the wind. Because whatever is on them: the future is wide open. Nothing is fixed. Nothing at all. We can all still go in any direction we like. Bring them in, guys. Thanks. Thank you, Tobias. Alright everyone, are you ready? Yes! Three, two, one... There goes my banana... Sep, have you seen Hasna? No. Bye guys, see you tonight. See you at the party. And? Are you coming to the party? I don't know. OK, I'll see you tonight. Hopefully... Dear parents, dearest children. Welcome at the greatest party a school can have. The 50th anniversary of this wonderful school. It is already stated in the deed of incorporation... \x22Today we open a place... where children can develop wisdom and insight in peace.\x22 Wise words that have not lost their value. What is this? \x22Addition to the deed of incorporation.\x22 \x22One year delay in construction.\x22 \x22Opening year is...\x22 What? But this is impossible. The yearbooks. There should be fifty. One for each year. One, two, three, four, five... ...twenty-six, twenty-seven, twenty-eight, twenty-nine, thirty... ...forty-six, forty-seven, forty-eight... forty-nine. The school exists 49 years. Not 50. Mrs. Dreus! Hey, guys. Why the long faces? I am the one that has to dance with Dreus opening the ball... One, two, three... Is there something wrong? - Tobias isn't here. And neither has Hasna. But they were gonna go together. - It did not work out. But Tobias was going to ask her. He told me. But then Tobias thought that somebody else had already asked Hasna. And Hasna heard it from Tom, who got it from Karim, who heard it from Sammy and Fred... that Tobias also had a date already. But that is not the case at all. And since they are both very shy... they are now at home when they could have gone together. Gee... It is just too bad if they miss the party. Maybe I still have time to get them. Forty nine... It should have been forty nine. Hello! Mrs. Dreus? Mrs. Dreus? Hello? Mrs. Dreus? Are you here? - Hank, I can't find her anywhere. Yes, she's not here either. Tobias! Tobias, hey! Hey, what is keeping you? We are all waiting for you. It went wrong with Hasna. She has someone else to take her. No, that is just it. Hasna is at home. She is convinced that you are going with someone else. But she was gonna go with... - That is a misunderstanding. You both have no one and now you are staying at home. Well, what do we do? Will you come? Yes! But Mister Casey, I don't have a suit. And what is that? I made it a little bit smaller. And now? To Hasna! We are in a hurry. Mister Casey, what do I say when I get there? If she wants to come. - Just like that? Just like that! Right, mom? - It is as simple as that. But remember to ask nicely. When you ask nicely... you can do anything. Look, that's where she lives. - Wow, that's high! My father climbed the pear tree next to my mother's house... and then asked her out. Alright, a pear tree... Well... Let's walk to the front. Wait a minute... We can slide out our own pear tree. One electric pear tree, for you sir. Straight to Hasna's window. Ho, ho... What is this you are doing? To Hasna's window. I thought that was OK? It is. But not alone. Casey will go with you for safety. - Me? For safety. - But mom... Show some stamina. It is for Tobias. Going well, Casey. Come on, Mister Casey. Tobias? Mister Casey? What are you doing here? I thought I was too late, that you already had a date. So did I! But I don't and you don't either. So I was thinking... You feel like going with me? Yes, very much! Wait, I'll be right back. How are you hanging on, Mister Casey? - Well, you know... It is not that bad. And you are doing fine as well. Casey! Casey! Are you two ready? Mom, quiet! Wow, you really look beautiful. Thank you! Shall we... I mean to the party. - Yes! Isn't it a powerful and compact truck, Casey? - Great, mom. Great for cutting corners! Mrs. Dreus is going to be furious. We are much too late. Never mind, it was for a good cause. Can you speed up a little more? - Safety first. I might have a solution though. Everybody is still out here. Hey, Mister Casey. Mister Casey, what are you doing in that fire engine? I had to pick up someone, Jacky. Tobias! Hasna! Fantastic that you have come. What a pretty dress. We have been waiting here for hours. Move over! It has not started yet? - Really strange situation, Casey. We have no idea if it's still on or not. - You don't say? Mrs., Dreus is nowhere to be found. We have looked everywhere. Inside and out. She has vanished, Casey. Vanished! But that can't be true. - Va-nished. Evaporated! Go and look for her yourself! Hello... Mrs. Dreus? Mrs. Dreus? Mrs. Dreus? Hello? Are you in here? Mrs. Dreus? How beautifully decorated this room is. Beautiful... It is such a shame that it is all for nothing... because we cannot find Mrs. Dreus. Such a shame. I was kind of looking forward to the opening dance. But the party is off. A real shame. I practiced my socks off dancing. The Waltz, the Quickstep... the Chachacha. If Mrs. Dreus were here, we could just begin. That is enough, Mister Casey. Mrs. Dreus? Well played, as if you did not know I was here. But the party is off. I made a mistake. It is not the school's 50th anniversary, but it is its 49th. 49 or 50 years, what difference does it make? What difference? What difference! Don't you see what I have built? Don't you see what it is that I am sitting in? A big 50! A big 50... I do like it. It is not right. It just isn't right. Do you know, Mrs. Dreus. The reasons to a celebration are trivial. The people who you celebrate with, are not. And we are celebrating with the whole school. That is something you only do a couple of times in your life. So whatever happens... it is not about how many years the school exists or what number you have built. That's not what's important. It is about celebrating together. It's about that! Together? Yes, so the party must go as planned. You make a good point, Mister Casey. Especially for a trainee... Is everybody here? - The whole school. For the party. That you organized! It is a perfect venue for dancing. It would be a shame not to... Mrs. Dreus, shall we just open the doors? What about that 50? That mistake! It'll be our little secret. This is it. A 50! And I thought she was making a big cage. Or a stage for me. It's beautiful though. Yes, you're right. How beautiful, with all the kids around it. Very festive. Thank you, Mister Casey. I must say, you have a very good eye. Well, are you ready for this? As ready as I will ever be. Well done, Mister Casey. A party such as this, should always go ahead. Marie Louise? Casey, now I know why you kept running away. You are afraid of heights. I couldn't find the courage to tell you and then it just kept on going wrong... Casey! You don't have to go in the balloon. We will think of something else to do. No. No. I have decided that all of my fears are over. All of them? - All of them! And there is only one thing I want. With you in a balloon. And then together we go up to the clouds. Oh, Casey. How sweet. Are you ready, Casey? Definitely! Watch and see. Look! Hey, mom! Hey, everyone! Hey Tobias, Hasna! Jacky!
