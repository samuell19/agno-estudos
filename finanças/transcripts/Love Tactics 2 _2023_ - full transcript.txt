[whimsical music playing] [woman 1] Just like in a fairy tale, you say "Yes" to your Prince Charming, to the man you love. You vow to be loyal and devoted to him for the rest of your life, achieving your dream and living happily ever after with the man you love for the rest of your life. Isn't that every girl's dream? What a bunch of garbage! From the second they're born, aren't they preparing these poor girls to be mothers? Think of their little dolls. And weddings, how do they dress those girls up? As little brides! So what else would she dream about besides walking down the aisle? Huh? What? Dream about studying particle physics? You know? Hold this. This dress needs a lot more work! You know what happens after you turn 16 for women, don't you? Everyone starts to ask if you're married or dating anyone. - "When are you getting married?" - [bride grunts] "Come on, you better get married soon." "Keep your eyes open!" "And don't let any man slip away now!" Why are you asking? Why do you care? Huh? Is it any of your business? Anyway... Oh, and here's the best part. You know what happens, if you don't end up getting married? Oh, you'll be alone until you die. Oh, but you'll have 11 cats. Isn't there an alternative? Huh? Like, you know, please, can't a girl just choose to go her own way and not be married and be fine? How can a man think it's a good decision to go and get married out of his own free will? How's that possible? It's just dumb! And it completely lacks purpose too! Hey, buddy, weren't you and I just making fun of this idiot... Something's gotten into this guy. He even looks different. He's just weird now, but all right! We made fun of him for getting married. Said it's a dumb idea. Didn't we say that? - My mind has changed about... - About what? Getting married? It's been one small year, big deal! No time to start thinking of weddings, stuff like that, Tuna! How do you think it'll go? And then before you know it, the great honeymoon phase is all over, dude. And then everything's just monotonous, and you'll both gain a lot of weight, each of you, at least 15 pounds. Big fights and blaming each other for it, man. Everything will end. Love, the thrill, the passion, it's all gone. I mean, what do you really expect? No marriage works out, right? What's the alluring thing about love? Those little, tiny surprise moments. The harder a woman has to work for your attention, the harder she'll fall in love. Actually, so, I believe expectation is important to make love last. That's why no girl thinks that having a bird in the hand, is greater than having one in the bush. And this my friends, imprisons us. They say that the heart is connected to our ring finger, that vein is the one that pumps there, but, all of them are hooked up to the heart too. That's right, my friend. You see, it's romantic bull used to trap men, and you bought it. Bravo. [emotional piano music playing] [voice breaking] You look gorgeous. Just be really happy, please. LOVE TACTICS 2 [upbeat dance song "Move of Love" playing] ♪ You give me everything That a girl could ever need ♪ ♪ Yeah, you're the kind of man That they're happy to believe ♪ ♪ Just keep on showing me All the light you've got in you ♪ ♪ We set each other free ♪ - ♪ When we really get in tune, baby ♪ - [music ends] What a horrible mistake. How could I do that? [ominous music playing] So now you realize it? [playful music playing] I what? Is there something that I missed? Calm down. Let's just relax, okay? The invitations haven't even been sent. There's plenty of notice! - Just go and call Tuna. - Yeah, okay. Tell him that you've had a change of heart about getting married but that you still love him, okay? Aslı, change of heart? What're you talking about now? But you... "Made a mistake," what'd you mean by that? [chuckling] Oh. Oh, wow... Yeah, I have a hairdresser appointment scheduled at the same time as the wedding cake tasting. That's what I was saying. Tuna's so sweet though, you know. He said he'd take care of the cake tasting himself. - [chuckles awkwardly] - Hm. [upbeat music playing] I wish Tuna could go to the hairdresser, making us all free for wedding cake. I just need the happiness that chocolate cake gives right now, that's all! [woman 2] Oh. Do you really think that's what we should have done instead? [woman 3] It's your wedding. [workers chattering] [music fades out] [customers chatting happily] [customer] Mom, should we try the chocolate one as well? [mom] Sure, let's have some. Most people bring their mother-in-law and their fiancée to this, but you... You come and bring your boys, huh? This part is a big deal. I can't just go and make a decision alone! Third time's the charm. It looks wonderful now! [sighing happily] It's really amazing now! Perfect! [inhales sharply] [sighs] But it might not be me though. Man, I like this piece better. Come on. Tell them that we want to take these two together and make a custom cake. Mister, please? Our mind's made. [man 1] Mmm! Mmm! Mmm. - [Tuna] Mm? - [man 1] Mm! Mm. Mmm. It's the one! [triumphant music playing] Oh my God, this might be the best piece of my life. One bite. - You mean it though? - One bite. Just one. Mmm. Are you two on something? You've completely lost it. - Can you please just taste it? - [man 2] Bro! - [music ends] - [Tuna] Bro, come back! This one is perfect, I really mean it, - Please. - [hairdresser] All right. Let's do it. [bride] This'll be great. - What? Hey! - Just a little stab. - Back away. - Small stab. - [phone buzzing] - Would you just... Hello? - [phone buzzing] - [grunts in frustration] Hello? Kerem. This is perfect timing. I was just about to call you. I need to get bailed out of this, like right now. I was also just imagining doing horrifying things to my good friends, babe. It's not good. I'm in a bad place. They asked to be introduced to someone too. A dance teacher. My plate is full for a bit. Should I pick you up then? No, I want you to be with me now. No, no, I can't wait anymore! - [instructor] Move in closer. - High five... [instructor] Move away and turn. [upbeat dance music playing] Oh... [inaudible] [music fades] I've longed for you. As have I. You really missed me, didn't you? Why don't the two of us just go to a private place and I can demonstrate for you, hm? [bride] Am I doing it right? [instructor] Put your left arm a little... Like this. [bride] Uh-huh. [upbeat dance music rises] I think they might be having a stroke. I was actually thinking something poisoned them both but maybe a seizure. Beyoncé. There we go! [both] Ahh! Then come to pick her on up... And up. - [Tuna] Here we go... Oh! - [bride] Oh no! - Cansu! - [Cansu] Oh! Oh no! - He fell down pretty bad. - I think he might be... - Tuna! - Stay back. Stay back. I'm fine! I'm fine. - Are you sure you're okay? - My legs all bent... Ah! [Aslı] That looked awful. He fell really bad. You know if he broke his leg he might not even realize it. I know most men all just have embarrassingly bad dance moves, but this is on a whole other level! [music fades out] Thankfully, your lover's a good dancer. Oh, you... You learned how to dance? All so you could impress girls! [chuckles] You're such a cliché! Only to impress one girl. Damla. She asked me to go to a party to celebrate her graduation while I lived in France. And I just... just didn't want for her to be embarrassed, so I took a few lessons, - and then I began to like it. - You like it? Uh-huh. Damla, by the way, might be the aunt who raised me. [Aslı] We've been together a year and you still manage to surprise me. We've been together a year and I can't turn my eyes away from you. [romantic string music playing] Hey, Kerem, do you know why everyone always thinks that you have to get married if you're in love with someone? I just don't understand it. You're right. It makes no sense to me. And all those ceremonies, making big shows over a whole lot of nothing, you know? If you really wanna go get married, make the ceremony very quick and small. Right, if you really have to marry him... you should just get married with only your closest friends on a beach, right? - Only if you have to do it? - In my head, it's unnecessary. I didn't know that you were so opposed to getting married. That surprises you? Because a very strong and confident woman just might be fine on her own and not marry? It's because you're perfection. Am I, huh? [giggles] But I just can't show the girls that marriage is a bad idea though. I've been telling the boys the same. Just imagine that we're married, and everything that we've wanted to do is just a huge bore. No love. No thrill at all. [whispering] But you would never think it... It makes your sex life much worse too. - Course it would be! - It's less sex, not more! You know just being under the same roof makes couples argue. No time for sex like that. I guess there really isn't, is there? [giggles] Well, this is great. I won't have to marry you. [dramatic music playing] [music crescendos] [music fades] [Cansu] I still don't understand. I thought that you didn't want to get married to him. What's making you so angry then? This time, I'm the one who needs it explained. Yeah, not marrying's perfectly fine, but... But not marrying me is a big mistake to make. But I should be the one to make that choice. [rock music playing] Tuna! So, are you totally sure they told you that your poor ankle's only sprained? That's what the doctor said. I have to say it another time? Hm? I trust my medical practice. The doctor really told you that you only sprained your ankle and yet you have to have that thing on? Man, that leg is totally broken. 100%. [chuckles] He's worried we'll say he should wait to get married. [exhaling deeply] Hoo-hoo-hoo. [Kerem laughing] Well, that's just my luck, boys. Aslı's the one. I think she's the perfect girl. - After today, I'm sure. - [music fades out] She also doesn't want to get married. Thinks it's a bunch of bull. And who is this man to be fine, denying me in marriage? Do I want to marry you anyway? I don't even wanna get married to you! It doesn't matter! He doesn't want to get married to me he says! I've got some news, I don't want to get married too! She said that again and again the last hour. Should we be worried? [laughing scornfully] Yeah, not marrying's perfectly fine, but... But not marrying me is just a big mistake, right? I should be the one who makes that mistake. Me! [crazed giggling] Yeah, I think we should be right about now. Who is this guy to say he doesn't want to go and get married? I've had so much luck, boys. - [playful music begins] - [laughs] [laughing] [Tuna] Aslı... Aslı just pulled one on you, man. [laughing hysterically] It's not a trick. Stop. That's exactly what she said. Just listen, the word "biological clock" mean anything to you, man? - Uh. - Yeah. At the most, I give it a year. Aslı's not the kind of woman you think she is. I'm saying that's exactly what she told me. Why don't you believe me, bros? All right, let me share an old saying. You should never trust every word that... a woman says. [rock guitar playing] [laughing] Here, you can pay for your taxi. [laughing hysterically] - [whimsical music] - [Tuna] You can never trust every word... [Aslı] You can never trust every word that a woman says. [Kerem] You know just being under the same roof makes couples argue. No time for sex like that. I won't have to marry you... [music fades] [upbeat music playing] - [Aslı] Good morning. - [assistant] Good morning. Welcome. [woman] Hi. - Can I see this one on a mannequin? - Of course. [music ends] I have a new plot for us, girls. - [mysterious music plays] - Time for us to start a new battle. I'm gonna make sure that Kerem will change his decision. I will get rid of every bit of desire she has to marry me right now. If she has any. So let me ask you then, why don't these men get married? Because he thinks he's going to lose his freedom. It's all that's running through his head, right? All right, guys, why do women get married? First and foremost, they're raised on it. It's in their DNA. Boys go off together and play with guns and cars. Barbie and Ken go get married at their playdates. [music ends] Hey, I made all my dolls marry too. Let's talk about your strange childhood later, okay? They know that they would have to go and care about their family and future, so they try staying above that. Obligation, right? Oh, that is totally true! Make notes, Cansu. Right at the very top. They need tons of love and attention so they all run to go get married just to be safe, right? Oh! But, you know, I've never really thought about that. It's a truth never spoken out loud. Did you get that? Yeah, that's good. First of all, I will go and show him that when we marry each other, he'll have a great life with all his freedom and I'll never restrict him. First of all, I'll show her just how really even the idea of marriage is bad, and it'll bore us to death. Not an easy task. I'm going to need both of you to help. Just say the word. Hey. Psst. Let me see that. [phone buzzing] [giggles] - Honey? - [Kerem] Honey. Uh, you have plans tonight you have to make? No. My plate is open now. You planned something for me? I did but Emir is making weird gestures at me right now though. There's a presentation we have to work on. My house might be where I'll meet with them, and... you should hang out with us if you can. Could get boring. [Kerem] But we'll do something after we're done. All right, I can come. Great, babe. Come by around 7:00 tonight? 'Kay, babe. Okay, bros, listen to me, ask for a ton of difficult things from Aslı tonight, okay? We'll break her. [sighs] This is just what I needed. But tonight, I can go to his house and show off that I could be a little bit of a geisha for him. And I said "could," so I won't show him how I can be one. [playful music playing] - Honey? - Darling? Could you make some coffee? [chuckles softly] I'll make some for you guys. Uh, Turkish coffee's the best, right? Yeah, or we could have myrrh instead? Myrrh, really? [whispering] Didn't you tell us to go crazy, huh? Myrrh. Have you bought us some myrrh, honey? No. No, myrrh, no. Uh... - Turkish is perfect. - Yeah, man, Turkish. How would you like it? Mm. Please no sugar. A bit of sugar. Mine should be very sweet then. Bunch of sugar, okay? Great choice. So with, without, and one in the center. Okay. Oh, babe! The machine's broken. You'll have to make it on the stove. That's the only way to really do it right. Here they come! [upbeat music playing] - Let's have tea? - I'll get you some tea? Read your mind, honey. [chuckles] On it! [clears throat] Oh, and babe, could you not use tea bags? Just loose tea. Of course, babe, I already started. I made it a bit ago. It should be almost done. It'll be a second. Can you please take that to the kitchen too, babe? Oh, I can take them. Don't worry. Let me, please. Thank you. - [Aslı giggles] Enough already. - And these. - I'll put this over there. - [Aslı] Uh-huh. I'll take these out of your way too. I'll show all of you guys what I can do. [giggles] Dude, she's not acting like herself. Do you think she's possessed by something? What're you saying? Think, buddy. Right? Don't make me say it, man. God forbid. You don't have any wood. [Aslı] Babe, when you said the boys were coming over, I left work early. I prepared you all some snacks. Mmm. Aslı, these are all just so incredible. Amazing. Wow. Just enjoy it. Enjoy all those. So you made all of these snacks by yourself? Have a few. I'll make you all a fruit platter. She's very good. - [car beeps] - [Emir] Thank you for everything. - [music ends] - I'm waiting for the recipe. [Aslı chuckling] Those two are crazy. [playful music begins] [Aslı] I'll make an excuse to go back home on my own. I won't be sleeping at his house now too. If he wants to sleep with me, something has to change, girls. He'll pull out a ring. Just watch. It's late, so... So then, off to the bedroom? Uh... You know I'm making a collection now, so my rest is very needed. I have an important meeting tomorrow. I should go sleep there, all right? I'll dream of us though. [music ends] Plan was a huge bust. He just seemed to know everything about the plan from the start. How would he even know I made this master plan? [ominous music playing] But then someone could have told him about the plan. What's up boys, huh? You tipped off Cansu about us making our master plan? I'm telling you, please. My lips are sealed, believe me! Aslı didn't know about our plan. All of us would be already dead by now, dude! All right, man. I keep my secrets, bro. [Tuna] I didn't say anything! Do you think your names will all fit on this one? Darling, our resumés might fit on there. [giggles] [sighs happily] [woman] Papa, Leyla is asking for you. Leyla, come here. Hey... Hey, princess. Come on, let's go. I may need a baby to borrow for the next step. You want a baby? Like a living one? Kill two birds with just one small stone. I'm going to show Kerem what an amazing mother I can be. I'm just bringing out the fatherly, paternal side of him, no matter how hard that stuff is for him. Yeah, but babies creep you out, don't they? It's not going to be permanent. All right, whose baby are you going to use? My big sister thinks twice about if I can babysit before she gives her over. [upbeat music playing] - Your sister's baby may work. - No. - Oh, yes. - [music ends] All right, thank you so much. Okay, that's great. How about 7:00? Sounds like a plan. Super, man. [suspenseful music playing] [whimsical music playing] [music fades out] [Kerem] Aslı? [Aslı sighs] Here you go. [exhales sharply, smooches] [toy squeaking] Okay, so are you going to explain this baby to me now? - It's Ezgi's sister's newborn baby. - [workers chattering] They asked if I would watch their baby for a couple hours, and, well, I just couldn't say no. - A few hours? - [toy squeaking] - [workers gasping] - [all giggling] - [Aslı] Ow. A restless leg... - Hm. That's sometimes natural. - Can we please talk somewhere private? - Yes, please. [chuckling softly] Well, you look so cute with it! You look so cute! [toy squeaking] Just tell me how to keep this thing occupied for an hour. Well, for an hour, um... Hm. Um, I might... Might feed it. We can change its diaper. Put it down for a nap. How hard can it be, huh? It's a baby. It's not too complicated, is it? [baby cooing] Kerem? You look great with it. [Kerem] What? I... I don't even know how to hold this thing. Here, sit. [tsking] - [baby crying] - [Aslı] Ah, ah, ah, ah... Well, who knew you could be such a little cutie, huh, buddy? [baby farting loudly] [grunting] - [Kerem grunting] - I don't feel good! [groaning] Can you tell me how such a small baby can make something smell so bad? [moaning, coughing] [upbeat music playing] [Aslı whimpering] Aslı! Come on, I'm passing out, okay? Impossible... [Aslı] I'm going to show Kerem what a great mother I can be. I'll make it happen. - Okay. - Come on. [giggling] It's a boy. - That might be important. - No. Uh, can we help out with some, um... - [Kerem] Be my guest. - [both gagging] - I can't, I'll throw up. - Oh. [Emir gagging] Everyone get down! No. Ugh. I've got it! [gasping] So smart, honey. [upbeat music continues] Super! Not so bad. [baby gurgling] And we can close it now, right? - [spraying] - [Aslı gasping] Ah! - Hmm! - [baby giggling] [upbeat music continues] [sighs] [laughs softly] [music fades out] That took it out of me. Me too. [Cansu] Well, I can't seat my aunt and my sister-in-law together. They just got into a huge fight at Mete's circumcision party. Okay, I know what to do. We'll seat my aunts at one table, and my uncle and his wife at another. [scoffs] I can't make it work that way either. It's just impossible to make everyone feel okay, Honey! Do you think seating them at different tables is a good plan? [exhales deeply] Aslı, no! But I can't make it work! What am I supposed to do? Kerem knows that something is going on now. Aslı's trying to keep something big hidden, I know it. - What's he up to? - I don't know. I am just sure he knows what I'm trying to do to him, girls. You sound really paranoid right now. Well, bro, what could it be, huh? She might now want to marry me and so she's trying to change my mind, right? Hey, man, when I said she wanted to get married to you, all you said to me was, "She definitely doesn't want to get married to me." - Yeah, I told him. - Okay, so you told him then. How could he know that you changed your mind about getting married? You're right. What would've changed it? How could he have found out? Who cares? My newest plan's great. Ladies, I have a great opportunity. My plan is just totally perfect now! Perfect, girls! It can't be any better! Our next plan involves an unhappy couple that has a very big fight, boys. [balls clacking] Huh, do we know anyone? Tuna? Has our Emir ever shown you his wife? - No. Never showed me. - [Kerem] Weird, I haven't met her either. Before we were friends, you got hitched, right? There's no proof she even exists, you know. Have you just been fooling us all these years with a fake marriage? Look. Check out the marital status, okay? MARRIED - [Emir] There! - Okay. He's married. Come on, are you a sociopath or something? Keeping her away from the public? Why haven't you ever introduced her to us? No big deal. Just a timing thing. For two years? Dude, she's not real. [whispering] I see dead people. [Emir] Don't be ridiculous. She and I have been fighting, bro. Please, I don't need this now. - You've been fighting? - Yeah, it's bad. Constantly. It's gotten really bad now. Can't go a minute without arguing... Oh, no. No way. Come on, man. Tuna? That's our plan. [Ezgi] Oh, wow! That's a great plan. I think your parents are just the perfect couple. So compatible. They're amazing. And both still love each other like they just got married yesterday. Aw, that's so cute! Uh... Oh, aren't they in Izmir or something? Yeah, they were, but that's why I said it's a great opportunity. They're visiting tonight so I can introduce Kerem to the both of them. I haven't seen them for a couple months. I really miss them. [Kerem] You're coming to my place tomorrow, Emir. Understand me? Tuna, you should come too. You know that Aslı might be a little suspicious of this whole thing. Dude, please, it's bad. It's not a good time. This timing's bad, okay? Yeah, man. That's perfect for what I need. You'll fight so Aslı can see a big, bad fight and scare her off. Perfect. Come on, dude, translate. Come on. You owe me. It's time now for you to pay back. - Hey, you can't just make up that stuff. - Sure you do. [phone ringing] Honey? I was just about to call you. Uh... I have great news. Emir and his lovely wife are planning on going over to my place. He wanted us to meet before the wedding. Uh, Cansu and Tuna are joining too. You can let Ezgi know about it. We'll be one big... [tires screeching] What? So they're coming. - To... Tonight? - [snickering] No, please, I just meant that, babe... - No, that would be... Uh... - [both laughing] Yeah, but... Uh... But I made other plans, I just have to be somewhere. I'll be there. Your parents come first over a dumb meeting. - [whispering] Sorry. - Yeah. [laughing continues] Yeah, babe. All right. - RIP. Sorry. - Well, the ring is appearing right on him. [romantic string music playing] No, don't loosen your collar. Here, let me... You know I despise these, babe. I hate these ties! Why are you insisting I have to wear one tonight? Well, it's the family, you have to look good. We wouldn't want my father to think that some random bum is dating me. You're saying that if men don't wear ties they're bums? - I think you might be stressed. - I'm totally calm. Really calm. I was just about to ask you the same thing. No, sir. I'm the one who's really calm. - Oh, don't be super scared, okay? - Okay, I'm not. I'm not! My papa is very strict, and he's very disciplined about some stuff, but he's such a good man. And also, you know, both my parents are really still as much in love as they were years ago. I haven't seen the two of them argue even once because they love each other so much! Trust me, you'll see when they get here. - [horn honking] - [gasps] Oh, they're here! [gasps] Darling? I think you are nervous! [laughing] You're totally nervous! - Here they are! Oh! - [light fixture clanging] All right, come here. Don't be shy, okay. [mother sighing] - Hi, welcome. - Hi, my love. - Mommy! Mwah! - Oh, my baby! [Aslı] I've missed you so much! Mom, this is my boyfriend, Kerem. Kerem, Canan. - [Kerem] Hello, it's nice to meet you. - Nice to meet you too. Pleasure. - Okay. - Papa's not here? - Uh... There he goes. - [rumbling engine approaching] [rock music playing] Servet, but... No hugs for big papa, huh? [laughing] - My papa? - [music ends] Oh. Aw, there you are honey. - What's up? - Papa? Kerem? How are you, Mr. Ercüment? Please... Ercüment, please, that's not my name, okay? "Ercü's" better. You manage a bank? A banker, wait... - I thought that mom said advertising. - No, no that's my job. What's up with the suit, then? But... A meeting before this. Come on, meeting's over, man. Hold this a sec. Let's just undo this button. Undo it. Just relax. Relax. Ha! Oof, come on, you're big. Let's go. All right? [Aslı chuckles awkwardly] - [Ercü] How tall are you, bro? - He said "bro." - [Kerem] Six foot three. - Unbelievable. An inch taller than me. Um... Papa's different now. Andropause did it. What? He's gone. Lost it! [sighs deeply] [whimpering] But why me? No way you're taller than me, son. - [Kerem] I... - You're not. [Kerem] I'm probably not. We might be the same... - I'm six foot, two inches. Uh, my friend. - Uh, y-yes. Take a pic with me. [playful music starting] - Sure. - Okay. No. My dear, I can't take it, or I'll faint! Take this now. Here. Yeah. You have alcohol? Yeah, I do. But shouldn't we eat first? - [Ercü] That one's not good. - Aslı, dear. Please, I will need a drink to put up with this man or I will lose my head! Hm? Understand? - I look great, but you don't look so good. - So just screw making me dinner. [camera clicking] Instagram follow me, okay, man? Papa made an Instagram? Yeah. He even bought more followers there. Huh? Ah, Aslı, okay. Alcohol. Alcohol, darling. Please, let's go. Let's go. Let's make that drink. Make it strong. - Strong. - Check the profile. - It's on fire, right? - Oh, yeah. It's really great, Mr. Ercüment. Call me "Ercü," okay, please. [chuckles] My fault, I will. Ercüment. Uh, Ercü. [Canan sighs] Go. Go ahead. Pour. Now, okay, did Papa just someday become a completely different guy? - [groans] - Why? Out with it. I'll tell you. So, okay, the first thing was buying all these stylish young people clothes. Sure, I was uneasy around him. Oh, but I didn't say a thing to him. Mm. Mmm. Then he just bought a new car, and... Yeah! He got a convertible. A brand-new sports car. Oh, Aslı. Aslı, you have to see the thing. He looks so awkward in it. So awkward! You already saw the motorcycle. - [softly] Uh-huh. - [sighs] Anyway, after that... The way he talks, the way he walks, his mannerisms even are just so ugh! [voice breaking] He's gone. He's gone. Like the triceps? Wow, those are really, very good for a guy of your age. A guy what? - [stammering] They're amazing. Super fit. - Oh, please, feel. Do you do kato? - [stammering] I don't like that form. - Oh! Kato's great! It'll make ya sore. - I'm not sure. - You'll get really sore. Just take me as an example. - Yeah, sure, you're right. - Huh? You're good. Hey, show me yours. - Uh, no, but it's my privacy. - Come on, show me. - No. Mr. Ercüment, I... Ercü... - I'm begging you. Show me. Come on. - No, please. I... - [chanting] Kerem, Kerem, Kerem... - I want to be divorced now! - [rock music starting] So it's over? Well, I'll see ya. We can go ride. [rock music fades out] - I'll expect that sample soon. - [man] Okay. Thank you. Oh! What are you two still doing here? I'll see you tonight. I'm trying to get the collection ready right now. I neglected work while I was busy with your wedding and our plans and games. Now we have a really big surprise. A great big one! To surprise me, huh? You'll see in a second. - You miss me? - [squealing] - [Cansu] Here he is! - Ah! - [Aslı] Bulut! - [Bulut laughing] - How did you...? What are you doing here? - Ah! - You two! - [women giggling] Hmm. - [Bulut] I've missed you. - [Ezgi] How are you? I'm good. You look the same as before. Honestly, I think you got even prettier. - Aw, no I didn't. Stop. - [all giggling] - I've just missed my ladies. - We've missed you so much. Really. Didn't think you'd be able to get here. I'm so glad you came. This is so exciting! My baby Cansu's wedding party is something I wouldn't miss, my friends. - [squeals] Married, wow! - [Aslı] Yeah, you're getting married. This place is just... It's really nice. You finally had the guts to create a new brand all for yourself, huh? It was time for it. - Amazing work. - Thank you. Aslı? These are stunning. It's amazing to get compliments out of you, as such a big, acclaimed, worldwide brand. Thank you for saying It, but don't say it just to make me happy. You know how I am when I talk business. I wouldn't just say that to make you happy. [chuckles] - All right, let's sit down and talk. - [Ezgi] Sit. Should we have drinks? All right, your turn. Tell me, how's life? How're you? [sighs] Tiring. Well, half a year Dubai, half a year New York. Few trips in between. Oh, Bulut. Oh, now, you poor man. Now I feel bad! Right? So many trips. How do you do it, poor guy? Please, let's grab food. I'll tell you all about my difficult life. Well, we actually have some plans made for this evening, Bulut, but... Kerem's hosting. Kerem? [whispering] We're together. - Boyfriend? - Yeah! And his name is really Kerem? [laughing] Come on. You all must have made fun of this before. The tragic love story! Someone always makes up bad jokes wherever we go. Okay, then. So someone finally made the cut to date you, huh? Now, I want to meet Kerem. I must. If you think it's hard, you're probably right. Imagine that. Bulut, stop messing around. [laughing] If he still doesn't bring his wife, I'll use work to punish his ass. - Dude, he doesn't have a wife, you know? - [Aslı] Kerem? - [Ezgi laughing] Hey! - [Kerem] Hey, welcome! A man? Looks like we have an outsider among us. New to me. - [Kerem] Honey. - [Aslı] Baby. Here, I'll introduce you two. Bulut, my childhood friend. He came from Dubai for Cansu's wedding. - How are you? Kerem, my friend. - Thanks, my friend. Sorry for coming over uninvited like this, buddy. - Don't even mention it. Please. - Thank you. [squealing loudly] It's so great that you're here with us. [squeals] - Follow me. - Yeah, good plan. Here. [Cansu exclaims excitedly] Hey, what's got her acting like that? What the hell? [R&B music playing] No way. They just photoshopped a model next to Emir, bro. [music fades out] Gentlemen, allow me to introduce my wife, Feride. Hi, there. Kerem. - Nice to meet you. - Nice to meet you as well. Feride, wow. So her name's Feride is it? More like she's a Bella, you know... A Kendall. A Gigi. My friends call me Tuna. - Nice to meet you, Tuna. - Pleasure, really. [Feride giggling] Oh, oh! Feride? - Aslı? [squealing] - Is this real? - [Emir] What's going on here? - [Tuna] Hey, man... Please, just tell me. Be honest. If she's a model, tell me. - I'll murder you. Do something, bro. - He's right. We'll talk about it later. [Aslı] I can't believe it's been so long! - Yeah, and look at this. - What man? Emir? [giggling] [gasping] Bulut? Feride? - How are you? - What happened? - Kerem? - Emir? - Tuna? - Not our business, baby. Relax. [Aslı] Uh, this is a crazy coincidence! Uh, we went to the same high school with Feride. It's been so long since we've seen each other. Wow, that's great. Very interesting stuff. Um, who's he? - Who? - [Emir] The guy in front of you. He looks like Adonis. Like he's a freakin' Greek sculpture. Come on. - Oh, Bulut. Oh, he's... - Bulut and I dated. Just briefly in high school, but yeah. You dated? - Come on, man. - Should we sit down? I'll go hang out with them now. - Dude, relax. - [grunts] - It's a stroke. - Just let him go. He's gone. If you're hungry, I'll make plates for you and me. - She's not hungry! - I think I have lockjaw, guys. [Emir moaning] [Tuna] You okay? Should we brawl? [Aslı] This all feels like a joke. I mean, the mysterious wife of my boyfriend's best friend just happens to be one of my best friends that I had during my childhood. Emir mentioned an Aslı, but I assumed my luck would never be that great that I would see you again. Sounds like toast time then. To best friends reunited, huh? - [glasses clinking] - [Aslı] Cheers, everyone! [Feride laughing] By the way, you told Emir about being a pair during high school? I mean, we only dated a week. We didn't even hold hands. He was about to have a heart attack. Emir and I are just in a really bad place recently. We're fighting a lot. Made him a little jealous of nothing! - Good tactic. Very smart move. - [Feride giggling] Tomorrow night's party all figured out? Honey, please, let's pick something else to talk about, yeah? Everything is under control. Don't worry about it. So what's tomorrow night? Yeah, Cansu's bachelorette party's coming up soon, and I'm organizing it. But what is it? What's the big deal? Where are we going? I ask you all the time and you just try to brush it off. Can't be that hard. I mean, there's only so many places to have a party like this, right? We'll go somewhere and have fun. Oh, so we're just doing whatever? Please tell me you're joking. - That's the plan? - Yeah. Please, if you have better ideas... Come on, Aslı. Really. - [melancholy music plays] - We get that this wedding stuff, and that having a huge party just for it doesn't really mean anything to you. And you know that we respect that. But Cansu thinks this is an important party, so... And you need to show the same level of respect for her. But you've been very condescending about Cansu getting married. I'm just saying, Cansu just wanted to feel special. Something that shows her that you remembered how much she cares. [voice breaking] You're right. Of course. I should've... [sniffles] Oh no, I'm awful. I'm awful. I'm gonna... I gotta go now! - I have to go right now! - Wait, where are you going? Just sit down. - [Aslı] No. It's over! - [Feride] Where would you go? [Aslı gasps] I'm in the middle of the sea. - [Feride laughing] - [Aslı] What am I supposed to do now? It's bad! I really am awful. I can't believe... Just calm down. We can still make it work, okay? We won't. It's hopeless, I'm sure of it! Calm down, please. Just relax. I have an idea, but not sure if you'll like my plan though. - We bring her to my island. - Oh, go to your island... - Wait, an island? - Yeah. It has a hotel on it. - What? - [Aslı] A hotel? - [Bulut] Mm-hm. - Oh, you are a lifesaver! Wow! Unbelievable! He has an island! We have an island! Well, I guess we should make a list! Oh, we have to make plans. What kind of an event should it be? - Who should we invite? Like... - Okay. ...which of Cansu's friends should we... "I have an island." Are you serious? [Aslı squealing] To the island! [Bulut] To the island! [commentator on TV] ...bringing it on home. Ha! This guy is a real competitor. One-of-a-kind player, and certainly a force to be reckoned with. What's up with the two of you? [commentator on TV] Are you seeing what I'm seeing here? - Kerem's completely in the dark, right? - Hm. The island, that's what you're talking about? - [Kerem laughing] - Come on, this man is so calm right now. Look how calm he is! I've been in and out of meetings all day, and you know what? Ask me if I remember anything about what we discussed today! - Do you, man? - None of it! None of it! Ask me why. Why I don't. All right, tell me... - Tuna, say something. - Okay, what happened? Come on, is this a Q and A? For the love of God just get to the point, okay? All because Bulut was my wife's boyfriend a very long time ago! Not only that, man, but even Kerem can't beat his looks, you know? [tense tango music playing] He's more handsome than... I... Oh, boys, come on. This... [sighs] First of all, I'm more attractive than him. - But I think he is. - And secondly... that was all years ago. - Do you trust your wife, bro? - Sure I do, but, uh... - Okay. - Um... And thirdly, and this is important, Just how, man? How'd you marry a gorgeous girl like her anyway? [Tuna] Oh, yeah. How did you manage it, really? When people say, "Hey, look beauty and the beast," how's that work? Right here's the beast, dude. [scoffs] So what's your trick? Come on. Well, joke all you want. [Kerem] Hey, I'm being serious! We have some big lessons to learn from you, right, bro? Hey, why are you so jealous anyway of Bulut? Man, let Kerem worry instead. - Hm? - What? - No. - No, what? No, I'm good with my snacks over here. No business of mine anyway. What'd you just say? - Did I say something? - Yeah, Tuna! Say it! All right, then, men. Bulut was in love with... - Aslı, okay, bro? - [gasps] But then Aslı didn't feel the same way, so he and Feride went and... Well, you know. Cansu said it. [Aslı] Hmm... Mm-hm. You know what? I think the last one you tried on is good for a party like this one. Buy the white one, okay? Yeah... New plan! Let's all wear white. Please, let's do it! [giggles] - Okay? - Sure. Okay. I still can't believe you did this, Aslı! I knew you would surprise me with a big thing, but I didn't expect this at all! Thank you so much. [emotional music playing] - It's not all my... - [Ezgi] No, you are... a great woman. [squealing loudly] [Ezgi scoffs] - [Cansu] Ah! - Please cut the screaming out! That terrified me, sorry. But I'm just so thrilled right now though. Come here, I'm so lucky to have you two! - [Ezgi] You scared us! - [all laughing] [music ends] [Emir] Well? What's the plan then? Hey, maybe we get some food. I'm starving, guys. - I think that you're upset about this. - No. But I trust Aslı with him. Um... You said... You said it. It happened years ago, and Aslı didn't feel the same way. Right? [Emir] Yeah. No problem. It'll be great then. The girls will go to a remote island with a man who lives a life of luxury in Dubai. A man that may be flawless, okay, but that's fine with me. [Kerem] Life of luxury, my ass! Not like in Dubai he's the sheikh or anything, right? Right. He isn't. Dubai's sheikh, though, is his friend, and they also work together in business, and that's not all! Look, I couldn't even believe my eyes when I saw this thing! - [Tuna] Let me see. - Here. Oh, wow! Look at this. He has a tiger! And it's breathing! [deep drumming sounds begin] [sensual traditional music player] [tiger roaring] - [music ends] - [panting] [exhales deeply] - [club music playing] - ♪ I'm rich, diamonds on my body ♪ ♪ Rich, smelling like Versace ♪ ♪ Rich, Jay-Z and Beyoncé - ♪ Rich, I'm rich, I'm rich, I'm rich ♪ - [cork popping] [screaming joyfully] So romantic!

Susurluk is a good place. Break. Eat. I would say something, but I'm not going to. [engine roaring] [pop rock music playing] - [gasping] - [Aslı] Let the party begin!

Mind if I ask the question on everyone's mind? And so how are we getting there? Well, once we wait, and he approves all of us, then we'll be renting one of these. Easy. This one works. We should rent something cool, yeah? Let's go over this another time. Okay, what's the plan, boys? We didn't follow them, without question. We can make that clear to them, yeah? Is that clear with everyone? Actually, we were clear the eighth time you said it, dude. But now this is the ninth time, it kind of confused me a lot. Can you just repeat it once more for me? The girls aren't gonna buy it. Aslı definitely won't. Come on, men, we're sticking to the story. Now, come on, we're men of advertising, let's sell it. You're the reason we're here anyway. Because of me, bro? That makes no sense, man! I'm not the one who called saying, "Let's go to the island." Yeah, but that kept the game moving forward. Ah, of course. Oh yeah, totally. - Right, of course. - [Tuna] Oh yeah, the game. [upbeat guitar music playing] - [music fades] - [women laughing] [Ezgi] Give me one too. I can't wait to party with you all tonight, you know. I know that you'll like it. It's gonna be great. [boat engine rumbling] [upbeat music playing] Ladies? So, mirages don't really happen out here, but... [giggling] So I'll meet Mirage soon? Oh! Those guys on that boat look exactly like Tuna, Emir, and Kerem! [Aslı] Right? Big brain question here. Did it occur to you that all of those men look similar since they're the same ones that we know, not because they look exactly identical? - Well, yeah, it has. - That's great. - I can't believe they followed us here! - [Feride] Crazy. The party's just beginning! [Cansu] They're here. [Cansu] Here they come. [Kerem] Like we planned. - [Feride] Prince of the boat! - [music fades out] [Emir] Baby, I came for you. - I came here for you, babe! - Baby, I'm so glad! I really missed you! - [Tuna] I missed you. - [Tuna and Cansu kissing loudly] - Sweetheart. - Hey, stranger. Good to see you. We were already in Marmaris for Tuna's bachelor party. We thought we'd just surprise you by making the trek to this place. - Uh-huh. Yeah, I'm sure, right? - Didn't I tell you she wouldn't buy it? I will break your legs. Break all of them, I promise you. That boat you got? Did you put some thought into it? - Isn't it great? It's cool. - So cool. Look at this. What a surprise, my friend. - Thanks, my friend, how are you? - Good, you? Great. Come on, man, just undo some of those buttons. We're having a little party tonight, and since you came all this way, would you please join us? Um, I don't see why not. Okay. Why not? Sounds like lots of fun. It's drink time then. [Aslı] Yeah, let's have a few drinks! [upbeat music restarts] [music fades out] - We thought you'd like it. - [gasping] It's perfect. Aslı, this is just beyond beautiful. I can't believe it. You're the best! - One more little surprise for the party. - What? [women screaming] That must be just how they talk to each other. [all continue screaming] [Flamenco music playing] You're only here since they insisted, not to follow me? Oh, yeah. Well, then... - [glasses clinking] - I guess I'll believe you. Big secret to tell you now! A minute alone? [Cansu laughing] Had too much to drink? [shushing] You know, in a bottle it looks harmless. It's in a glass, now buddy. [laughing] [woman laughing] Your mind is going to get blown when I tell you what I heard. Aslı, oh, that Aslı... Kerem, that guy... Bro, Aslı is trying to convince you to go and get married to her soon, man. He's trying to change your mind about the two of you getting married. Tuna said so. Cansu said so. Yeah, I knew. I knew something bad was going on with him. So now I understand her big plan. Cansu, you kept our big secret from Tuna? It possible at all that you just told Cansu about all of our plans? Just trust me, please! Oh, how dare you, Kerem. Cansu? Hey, please believe me. I wouldn't do that. Well, now I'm furious! [Aslı] So, you're really determined not to marry me, huh, Kerem? [Kerem] So, you're really trying to marry me, huh, Aslı? Wedding bells are already ringing. Dream on, girl. [tango music playing] Come on, then. [Aslı] Do you think we can do it? [Kerem] Just follow my lead. Men lead in the tango. [crowd applauding] Actually, the tango is a dance where every lady tries to get out and escape men. I read that somewhere. [crowd whistling and cheering] Good thing we're being honest with each other. No more games now. Right? [Aslı] You tell me. Why would I toy with you right now, huh? If you say so. Are you though? What purpose is there, baby, to toy with you anymore, huh? [crowd cheering] Sure. So no more games. I think that we're perfect for each other. Well, we are. - [whistle blowing] - [music ends] We just received a complaint. You're so loud, Greece can hear you all. Uh... we're just having a big party for our friend's wedding. We'll be super quiet. Time to party, guys. Begin partying! [electronic dance music playing] [women screaming excitedly] [laughing] [women screaming] [music fades] - [comedic music playing] - [crickets chirping] Morning. Oh, is it? Can't be morning. Sun's out for a while. All right, hurry. [moans softly] What's the rush? This time is really just the best time for this. [chuckles] No way, it's... Please, no balloons though. Surprise, okay? [chuckles nervously] - Kerem? - Hm? All right. I had a lot of fun, even though I was really scared, but let's not overdo it. You can't go on balloons more than once, right? You have to trust me now, okay? You might want this beforehand. - Hey, Kerem... Kerem. - Here. [whispering] Here. [blows] - But if it's... - Hm? If it's paragliding, or bungee jumping, just find someone else to do that. I can't come. That's right, I am saying permanently dead. I will be gone! I won't make it. I'll be scared. Just relax. It'll be great. [groans] Not again! [calming music playing] Watch your step. Little step down. - There we go. - [gasping softly] Just wait right here. - Wait here? - Here. [calming music warps and ends] Did you really think I would take you bungee jumping or take you out paragliding? No. Going on a plane ride wasn't ever what I thought you would do, right? You know, in just a few minutes you'll see a great view. Are you ready, Ms. Aslı? Kerem, can I ask you something? Could you ever just have your grand surprise on land instead? I just want to take you off your feet, and that isn't so bad, babe. - [man] Hey, love doves, you ready? - [yelping] - Ready, captain! - [giggling] I was really relieved to see that we're getting on a seaplane. - The drugs really do help though! - [snickers] Hey, you two, my name is Pilot Yavuz, sir! - Kerem, hi. - My name is Aslı, nice meeting you, sir! - Kerem and Aslı! - [both laughing] - Welcome. - Hm. Are you nervous? - I'm really nervous now! - Oh, I am too! You two are my first. - You said first? - You're my big first flight, guys! The qualification test is hard, so I couldn't pass, but... [laughing] [Aslı] Oh. - Give me back my hand. - No, it's mine now. - No, it's mine! - No. - Please! Let go of me! - I won't let go. Uh, listen, buddy... Babe! Should you take another pill? You're lucky I didn't swallow about a million of those pills. He can't do anything. He couldn't even get his qualification to fly this thing! [Yavuz] No, Aslı! - Please, wait! Relax. - Aslı! Wait! - I'm scared! - He passed. I qualified two days ago. - Don't lie to me! - No, baby, it's fine! Without you, I can't do my first flight. I need people to operate the plane. - That might not be bad for me! - Come on, please. - It's really windy. There's a storm! - [Yavuz] We'll see the coves! Come on. - [Kerem] Come on. - Let's not fly today, okay? - Just stay calm. - [laughing hysterically] [inaudible] [Aslı panting] You know you almost just made me panic as well. [Aslı] What? Uh, captain? [Aslı] Captain! - [upbeat blues music playing] - ♪ On the road, I know it's mine ♪ ♪ To feel what's coming around ♪ ♪ Take my hand now ♪ ♪ Look up to feel divine ♪ ♪ Freedom, adventure Don't think, jump let's fly ♪ ♪ Excitement rushes far ♪ [music fades out] [soft hum of engines] [light rattling] Aslı! You good, baby? [slurred] I feel fine. I feel totally aware of everything. [giggling] It's all so numb. I can't feel anything. Can I have one of those pills, please? Sometimes, I just get some mighty bad panic attacks, you know? - Oh! - [laughing] These guys help me a lot. Wha...? You gave him pills? He's unqualified and he needs help with panic attacks. [Aslı and Yavuz laughing] If you have panic attacks, how did you become a pilot then, huh? - Bro, watch the plane! - Why should I keep watch? There's no traffic, my friend! [both laughing hysterically] [ominous music starting] [thunder rumbling] Ooooh. We're gonna be dead very soon. [gasping] - Ay... - Uh, what? Captain? Captain! Oh! - Captain! - Babe. Honey! Great surprise, honey. Best one yet, you know. This was the best one yet. Captain, let's go, wake up! Get it together! Pilot, wake up! - [giggling] - Command stick. Look. Honey! Help me! I need to take control of the plane! Take control? As if you're a 40-year-old pilot! [laughing] Oh, "Command stick, the command stick!" [laughing] Oh! Well, that's great. He won't wake up now. Please say you're an amazing pilot or something. I'm not some secret aviator! Come on, please don't yell at me now! [Kerem groaning] Mayday! Mayday! Control! - Air traffic control, over! - The pilot passed out! I'm Kerem. I don't know how to fly a plane though. - [radio breaking up] - You're currently... - Mayday! Mayday! - [thunder rumbling] - Aslı, hold on tight! - [Aslı screaming] [dramatic music playing] [Kerem] Control tower! Can you hear me? [music fades] [melancholy music playing] Aslı! I'll love you forever. Aw, me too. I love you just as much! You big fool! I wish we had a wedding. And I regret every minute, every second of mine spent alone! [uplifting music playing] Me too. I want to make a confession about something right now. For days, I tried to change your opinion on getting married. You did that to me? [music fades out] Come on, please, give me credit. Cansu told me. She told me everything. And I've been trying to convince you to get married with all these plans and strategies, and all these things! [laughing] Okay, Tuna. So look, babe, I already told you about this, um... We are... We're matched perfectly with each other. [Aslı screaming] [Aslı laughing] This is the best! [Kerem] We're okay! - We just might be... - [Kerem laughing] You're my hero, Kerem. [Kerem laughs] So you managed to fly this old plane, and what about plane landing? [giggles] You dummy. Mayday! Control, do you hear me? Ah. Is it over? No, you can just go back to sleep. I'll wake you up soon. [shouting] Get up here now! Fly this thing! Fly it! Yay! We're such a great flight crew, aren't we? [camera shutter clicking] It was awful for us. [Tuna] Could have been much worse, though. If that idiot hadn't woken up, both of you could be dead, man. I've never been that scared my whole life. But, um... [melancholy music playing] You know what the weird part was? That fear wasn't for myself. I was only scared for her. I swear. The worst things crossed my mind. "What if something happened?" "How would I live?" And you know what I realized? Just how in love I really am. I want her to be there every minute with me. I really mean that. Here it comes. Ready? I think that it's time for Aslı to marry me. [Emir laughing] [Aslı] If I accept this offer, will I have to live in Dubai for six months? [Bulut] Yes. Aslı, I know it's a lot. It's a big decision. But it could be a really big opportunity. I really want you to think about it. [Bulut sighs] [melancholy music continues] I'm sure you're... worried Kerem won't like it, because the Aslı I know would never pass on this opportunity. [Cansu] Last one. Oh, look at all this stuff! The guy who got it is just husband material. Oh, Kerem. Oh, if only you were single... - Oh, wait you are. Ah! - [book banging] [smacking] - [Tuna] Babe... - [Cansu] Hm? I can't wait to live with the love of my life in one week. Me too. It's so exciting, babe. - Yeah! Well, I'm more excited. - No, I'm more excited. - No, I'm more excited! - No, I am. - All the unspeakable things... - [gasping] - [Cansu giggling softly] - Whoa, whoa. What's the issue? She's my wife, hm? [Cansu] Babe, should we check out the other rooms now? Hey baby, not before the big day! Ah. We're... Other rooms must be examined, you know. Check 'em out. [whispering] I said that to trick them. - Aslı? - Kerem? [chuckles] You go first. Say it. Bulut made me an offer for work. They'll invest in me, and also invest in the brand if I make a new collection to give their brand too. That's amazing, are you happy? That's so great! I always knew that you would be really successful. It's just beginning for you now. But I have to go to Dubai for six months now. [melancholy music playing] For six months? [melancholy music continues] [music fades out] [plays emotional tune] [plays emotional tune] [tune becomes hopeful] [uplifting music playing] [phone buzzing] - Kerem? - Tonight, meet at my house? - Sure, I can come. - Okay. Eight o'clock. - I can't wait. See you in a bit. - Kerem? You sound different now. What happened? Oh. I love you. [uplifting music rises] - [doorbell ringing] - [music fades] - Welcome. - I missed you. Here. Um, romantic meal for two I see. Maybe. - But there's another thing too. - [romantic piano music playing] [exhales sharply] You look gorgeous. [laughs] Well, thank you so much. [inhales] Know what I thought about through my day? No, what is it? The second I fell in love with you. Was it when I first saw you? Was it the first time that we spoke? Or was it... Was it when I saw the innocent girl hidden behind and lying beneath your big, strong outer appearance? Well... Well, babe, what was it? [smacks lips] I'm not sure. I couldn't find a second that my heart beat without you for even a moment, Aslı. It's like I always have. But, um... I figured out the moment I became sure I must be with you. Here. The night you played here... When... you played on these keys for the... For the very first time, I... [voice breaking] You made my heart soar then, Aslı. Kerem... Aslı. [shimmering tones] [romantic music continues] Kerem, stop playing. Please marry me, Aslı. - [voice breaking] I can't. - [music fades] [crickets chirping] Thought marrying me was what you wanted. And you thought marrying me wasn't. Your whole plan here is very obvious now. You want me not to take the job offer so you can just make me stay home. - No. - It is. No. My timing isn't great, but I need you to believe me that it isn't true. You were the one who made all these grand plans so I would hate marriage, weren't you? You were. What changed? It makes no sense, but please don't lie to me because I can't take it. Will you just... What did I say to you when I believed that that dumb plane was going down? That's because you thought we were dying. You told me that yourself after we got down on land. No, that's not true. That's not what made me say those things. Come on, please! Aslı! Please know I know my heart. And I'm sure of myself. And this has nothing to do with the job offer in Dubai, or literally anything else, it is just about you, Aslı. But what... And all the things that can go wrong in a marriage, huh? It may really just not end up being happiness forever, but... I'll be the best I can be and I'll make sure to do whatever it takes, I promise to make you so happy, Aslı. What if we hate each other in the end after all? In court, saying we're bad people, making awful remarks and threats? I'll take my chances. A paper won't stop me from loving you any more than I do. Come on, why do we need to have a wedding to make our love work? You have me already! But I don't want to just have you, all right? I want more. To belong to you. Don't you get that? I'm so scared, Kerem. [voice cracking] I'm scared too. Really terrified. Isn't that the beautiful part of this though? That we have to just try to be brave. So brave. Even though we're both so scared. It's all up to us both. Might be a huge old cliché... Spending every night with you is what I want. Waking up with you every morning too. Me too. Aslı? Just please marry me now? I will. [romantic rock music plays] [laughs softly] [sniffles] - Aslı, I love you. - I love you too, Kerem. [romantic rock music rises] [glass shatters] [music fades] [waves splashing] [romantic pop song playing] [crowd clapping] [Ezgi] Congrats! [yelling] I do! [all cheering] I do! [Emir] Congratulations! [officiant] I now pronounce you husband and wife. [romantic pop song rises] [music fades] [Aslı] Now you're probably wondering whether I went to Dubai or not, right? - Of course I did. - [joyful music playing] Because our marriage wasn't a restricting, repressive or destructive marriage. And it will never be. How our life turns out is all in our own hands. Kerem comes to visit every chance he gets. Our marriage is even more exciting and passionate than when we were dating. [joyful music fades] And a few days ago, we got very exciting news. Emir's going to be a dad. He only hopes that the baby will look like her mother. That is, if it's a girl. Tuna and Cansu got married a few weeks before us and they're very happy. [joyful music rises] Ezgi found the happiness she was looking for at our wedding. Now we're planning a wedding for her too. [joyful music continues] Like I said, our lives are in our hands. And for all those that want it... If you want, you could be next. [music fades out] [joyful rock music restarts] [music ends]
