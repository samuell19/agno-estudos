That's my cute little house. Those are my amazing 1,500 thread count sheets, my annoying alarm clock, and that's me, Deena Dempsey. And once again, I'm late for work. Oh, Olivia's gonna kill me. Grab some coffee. A bagel. Keys, keys. Keys, got it. And I'm off. Time to make the doughnuts. I really hate my job. No, I love this job, Olivia. Are you kidding me? - You know, when you started working here, I didn't think you'd even make it a week. - Well, you didn't really make it that easy for me, either. You know, your reputation definitely precedes you. - I know all about my reputation. By the way, I've already eaten and had my coffee, Deena. - Oh, wow. Am I really that late? Oh. I'm really sorry, Olivia. I just. I don't know why I just can't seem to wake myself up early these days. - Have a seat, Deena. - I really love your outfit, by the way. It's really beautiful. - Oh, thank you. Yeah, it's actually one of my favorite designers. These little get-ups cost way too much money, but I guess I'm a slave to fashion. Oh, Deena. Do you know you have the whole world right in your hands? I know you can't see it from where you're standing, but your life is happening right here, right now. And, sweetie, you don't even know it. - Hm. Yeah, well, life didn't quite turn out the way that I thought it would, that's for sure. - Mm. Now refresh my memory. You have one sister and one brother? - Yeah actually, I have two younger sisters and an older brother. - Oh. Nice sized family. And your mom and your dad, are they still together? - Yes. We actually just threw them a huge party for their 32nd wedding anniversary this past Christmas. - That is so nice. So, solid family, good foundation. And you know, you don't see that very much these days. Lasting marriages. Well, I've gotten rid of three husbands in under 15 years. You know, I was thinking. It's been a year since you started working here, helping me keep it all together. - Wow. Has it been a year already? - Yes. One whole year. - Oh. - And be careful, dear. If you don't keep track of time, you might end up wasting it. - Yeah. Oh Olivia, I just feel like I'm all over the place now. You know? I actually thought I would be married by now with kids just living my life. - Yes, I know. It's called going through the motions. That's exactly how I felt right before I retired. See, I just wasn't doing what I loved. - Yeah, but how many people actually do what they love anymore, you know? - The determined ones. The dreamers. - Hm. - We're not done, Deena. - Oh. Sorry. - I am gonna do you a huge favor. Something I should have done several months ago. - Oh Olivia, you don't owe me anything else. I mean, I'm truly grateful for this job-- - You're fired, Deena. - Fire. Fired? - Mm hm. - Are you kidding, Olivia? - No. - If this has anything to do with me being late, I'm sorry. I mean. I know that I've been late two times this past month but. - You've been late two times in this week alone. But it has nothing, nothing to do with that. - So what does it have to do with, then? What did I do wrong? - You didn't do anything wrong. You're just not doing what you love. Deena, you know. You know I don't have any children. But if I had a daughter, I would want someone to do exactly what I'm doing right now. I'm setting you free. - Setting me free? Free to do what, Olivia? Free to struggle, free to starve? This isn't helping me. I need this job. You're not helping me by firing me. - So this is where you stomp your feet and raise your voice in hopes that your tantrum is going to change my mind? This is what you call checkmate, no moves left. So put the key on the table when you leave. Oh, and would you please let the new girl in as you go out? Hm. - Wow. I suggest you keep a side job because Olivia Norman is a heartless beast. Good luck. Just come right in. The door's open. - I was starting to think you found another massage therapist. - No, you know better than that. But it is getting more difficult to get on your schedule these days. I guess that means you're busy, huh? - Yeah, it's been great lately. I can't complain. - Well, you never do. It's always good when I see you. - Gotta do what I gotta do. - Mm. Oh. How long you been working here, anyway? Oh. Oh, that's that spot that was sore from last time. - I apologize. I've been here for about four years now. - Well, that's good, that's good. You are good at what you do, that's for sure. - Thank you. I aim to please. - Well, I always know I can get the best massage in town courtesy of Sheena Dempsey. - Yeah. You can count on me, Mr. Hunter. I'll be here. - Oh, god. The worst day ever. - Deena, what are you doing here? - Oh, Tina let me in. It's fine. - This is why you shouldn't have your little sister working the receptionist desk. - I understand. - This is my older sister. It must be an emergency. - It is. You don't mind if I bend her ear for a moment, do you? No, not at all. I didn't realize you had another sister. - Yes, this is Deena, my older sister. Tina, you know. - Hi. - Hello. Tina, why did you let her back here? - She said it was an emergency. - She lied. - I did not lie. It is an emergency. Olivia fired me today. Deena, I can't deal with this right now. - But for no reason. - I can't. - She just fired me. - Listen, out now. You guys gotta go. Bye. - That is so rude. I need to talk to someone. - Now, now. We will talk about this when I get off work. Bye. - Bye, Mr. Hunter. Bye, Deena. - I'm so sorry. Relax. - Okay. What are we gonna say to her? - You know she's dramatic. - Yeah. - She's lucky I'm even here. I had six massages today. I'm exhausted. Let's do it. - Okay. If she's wearing pajamas, we're in trouble. But if she's wearing exercise clothes, there's hope. - Good call. - Hey. - Hi. - Hi. - I know you guys don't want to be here. - No. - So if you guys don't know what to say, I understand. - Deena, sit up. Of course we want to be here. - Yeah, and it's not the end of the world. You just lost your job, that's all. - Tina. Please look around you. You do understand that I needed that job in order to pay for all these lights and all that good cool air that you feel, right? - Well, at least it's not your house. It's Aunt Beth's, so. - Uh, yeah. And while she's gallivanting all around the world, enjoying her wonder years, I have to live here, and I'm paying all the bills. That was the arrangement. - Bottom line is you're gonna get through this, things happen, and you hated the job anyway. Do you want my job at the spa? Because I can find another one easy. - Mm mm mm. - If you want. - Mm mm. - What? Why are you so convinced that you can just easily find another job? - Well, I mean, there are spots opening everywhere. We're talking Target, Starbucks, that bagel shop that we love across the street is now looking for cashiers. - You have lost your mind. You do realize that I cannot support my lifestyle working at any of those places. - Deena, you need a plan, okay. - I don't want to deal with this right now. - How much time do you need? 72 hours. - 36. 48. - 48, deal. Not a minute more. - Oh. - That's it? How'd you do that? - You can't give her too many options. - Well, sis, if I have to get a second job to help you, I will. Okay? - Oh, baby sis, that's so sweet. But I'll be okay. I just need a few days to regroup. - And you will. - Yes. - You will. - You know, this whole adult thing is not working out like I thought it would. Remember when we were younger? - You mean when all we had to worry about was picking out a school outfit? - Right. - Exactly. Oh my gosh, speaking of outfits. Do you know remember how bad I wanted to be Whitney Houston? Girl. - I mean, I did have her range and octave. I just needed the outfits. Yeah, I don't remember that part. I don't remember that part. - From what I remember-- - You were obsessed, honey. - You were her for Halloween three times in a row. - Whatever. I loved her. You had that little crooked wig, too, with that little sparkly dress. - Oh, the "I Wanna Dance With Somebody" wig? I loved that wig. It was everything. I wanted to be a star. - No, honey, you wanted to be a superstar. - Remember when we wanted to be the Jackson Sisters? - I was Janet. - What were we thinking? And then Thad was our manager. - Remember mom was gonna kill us that day she found us in the backyard rehearsing in her shoes and clothes. - Oh, yeah. Ooh, that was bad. - Well, she let me go. - Uh uh, boo. You and Thad dipped and left me and D standing there by ourselves. Yes. - Wait a minute. Do you remember when dad caught Thad coming around the corner? Oh, my god. It was so funny. And he had to snatch him up. And he had to snatch him up and he brought him back to mom kicking and screaming. Remember, he screamed like a little girl? - Yes, yeah. Oh, my god. Those were the days. Those were the days. - It's just so different now. Too different. - Well, D, I'd love to stay and stroll down memory lane, but I'm not as old as you. - Don't play. - Don't forget, we have that team meeting tomorrow morning. - Oh, my god, I forgot all about that. - Yeah, wake up early. - One less hour of sleep for me. You gonna be all right for the night? - Yeah, I'll be okay. Got a pantry full of snacks and I could just wallow in my sorrow and just feel sorry for myself until I fall asleep. I'll get it. - Who's coming over here? - Thad, what are you doing here? What's up, sis? - God. Come in. Come inside. - Thad. Thad. What are you doing? - Hey, you. Why didn't you tell us you were coming? - Look at you. - Because I'm grown. I ain't got to tell y'all nothing. - Boy, please. Come inside. - Oh my gosh. We haven't seen you in forever. Thad. - Are you hungry? You want something to eat? - No, I'm just tired, you know, from that long drive. - You drove all the way from Miami here? - Yep. That's a long drive just for a visit, Thad. - Yeah well this time I kind of brought a little bit of extra things with me. Look, don't look at me like that. I'm not gonna be here that long. I just got some big things lined up. - Okay well, why don't you go upstairs and take a nap, then? You can do that. - I mean, I will. But there's just one more thing. - Oh, it's cool. You know, I could actually use the company. So you can just stay as long as you want. - I know I probably should have asked before I just-- - No, it's cool, Thad. I mean, as long as I don't have to put you out like I did the last time, then we didn't speak to each other for six months. - Deena, come on, man. I was young and dumb then. But look, right now, it's a whole lot of money to be made out here and I'm trying to get it all. - Wait a minute. So, what kind of big things are we talking here? - Well, I started managing this little music artist, right? Mm hm. - Now, this dude is about to blow all these clowns out the water. So I been setting up a whole lot of meetings and stuff like that in town with all the top producers. - So wait, wait, let me get this straight. You just up and quit your good job just to jump into the music industry? - It's not equating. - Sis, I been doing this for years, man. It's my time. I mean, why not now? So it's all or nothing. - Okay, brother. I'm kind of impressed, though. At least one of us is doing something that we love, so. Kudos. - And look, I promise you, I'm gonna help you out with all the bills, everything. You won't even know I'm here. - I'm not turning that down. - Hold up, hold up. How long? - Really? I thought you was on my side. How long? - 90 days tops. - Cool, cool. - Thank you. Cool. - One more thing, okay. Thad? - Now, I know it ain't gonna be a big deal, and I know you gon' love her watch. Where are you? - Come on, come on, babe. Oh, let me get that from you. What the? - Yeah, this is. Everybody, this is Ava. - Hi. - Ava, this is my three sisters Deena, Sheena, Tina. Everybody, this is Ava. - Hey. Hi. - Hi. - Hi. - Baby, this is where we're gonna be staying for the next few months. - Wait a minute. Did you say the two of you were gonna be staying here? - For three months? - As in dos? One, two? - Reminds me of a bed and breakfast. Baby, we can pretend we're on our honeymoon. - I know. We didn't have no honeymoon. - I know. I'm sorry, what? - Wait. - Did you just say honeymoon? You guys are getting married? - Uh, no. We are married. - Yeah. - Oh, god. - When did you get married? - Yeah, we did a little hush hush thing, you know, just a justice of the peace. Just something to make it official. - Do mom and dad know? - No, they don't know. And I don't want nobody telling them, either. Especially you. I want to tell them. - Okay well, out of these two, I'm the one who can keep a secret. - Okay. Wow. Congratulations. - Yeah. - Well. Okay. I'm gonna make a sandwich. Does anybody want a sandwich? Yeah, I'll take one. - I'm gonna make a sandwich. Let's have a sandwich. - Thank you. - Welcome to the family. - Congratulations, Eva. Nice to meet you. - Thanks. - Yeah, that's cool. - Yeah, I grew up with a bunch of brothers. So it will be so fun and cool to have sisters finally. Hey, they are much nicer. - Look baby, I'm gonna go to the car and get the rest of our stuff. Y'all go ahead and do your little girl thing. - I'm gonna miss you, baby. Oh. Hey so, how long have you been living here? - A couple years. - Okay. Okay. Yep, well, Thad told me that you guys moved from Miami together so. - Yeah, we all needed a change of pace. - So how do you like Atlanta? - I really miss Miami. - Oh, yeah. I love Miami. There is always something to do, but hey I'm looking forward to seeing what we're gonna be doing here. Change of pace. - I know. There's just something about Miami. There's always something to do and then when all else fails, I mean, you got the beach. - The beach. Yes. - So is this your first marriage? - Absolutely. It is. It's my first and my last. - Oh, that's what every girl hopes for one husband. A good one, of course. - Yeah. - Well look, I found my guy. And Thad and I are best friends. And we're in this for the long run, okay? Trust me. - So did you date a lot before our brother? - I've had my share. - Oh. - Your share? Whoa. Sounds way better than my love life. - No. No, that's so not what I meant. I just. Baby. I'm about to go upstairs and get us settled. - Babe, I am coming to help you. Look, so thank you, ladies. I'll be back down, but gotta go. - What the? - Her share? - You guys are plain evil. - Tina, please. - What? This is a very necessary evil. This is a line of questioning that we should have been able to do before he got married to that girl that we do not know. He took that option from us. - I cannot believe he's married and he didn't even tell us. - I didn't even know this woman existed. - Oh, my god. - All right, well. Leave you two to your guys' foolishness. I'm gonna stay out of it. Sheena, we gotta go. - You gonna leave me with all this foolishness after the day that I've had? Really? - I definitely need to go. - Oh, Thad, your sisters hate me. - They do not hate you, baby. - Yes, they do. - No, they don't. They just mad because they didn't know nothing about you. I mean, I kept you all to myself. - Baby, you should have heard them. They were drilling me. I felt like I was in one of the scenes out of "First 48." It's not funny. - Baby look, they're just not used to seeing me in love, that's all. - So what? I'm the first lady you brought around your family? - I wouldn't say all that. - Oh. - I'm just messing with you. All that's in the past. Listen. You are my wife now, okay? And they just gonna have to get over it. - I do not like the way she barged into my house without knocking. - She's not even his type. - She was wearing orange eye shadow. What does that mean? Guys? She's looking at us. - Tina is great. Sheena and Deena. Those are who I'm gonna have to be worried about. Especially, mainly Deena. - Hopefully, she can't hear us. - You're on your own. We're about to go. - Please don't leave me by myself. - Girl bye. - Listen baby. Do not worry about my sisters, okay? They're harmless. Trust me. The worst thing you could do is just start playing their little game. All you gotta do is just completely ignore them. They'll respect you more. - So you guys are pretty close, huh? Oh, yeah. You know what? I used to pretend that I was their bodyguard when we was kids, right? Man, I used to beat up so many people for messing with my little sisters. - Really? - And then they had this singing group. The group. I couldn't sing, so. All I did was boss them around like I was Joe Jackson or somebody. We was crazy. - Ha ha. Now that's hilarious. - No, but on the real, the group was good. They was real good. See, my mom used to be a singer back in the day, and well they kind of got it honest. - Really? So who was the leader? - Well, it went back and forth. It was either Deena or Sheena. Sheena had the better voice, but Deena, she just wanted it so much more. You know? And you know, Tina just went with the flow. She just kind of did whatever, sat there and smiled and just sang. Listen, baby. Just be you, okay? You're my wife. You're family now. There ain't no other option. Plus, I got your back. - Yeah, right. I got your back. - No, you don't. - My baby. You know I got your back. You got my back? - I got it. Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah. - Oh, god. - I can't believe Thad just showed up, married at that. Leave it to Thad to shock us all. - I know, right? But he's always been like that. Just goes for it, doesn't care what anybody thinks. - Yeah. Ava seems all right minus the window thing. - She's okay, I guess. - They seem happy together. - We'll see. Now back to my reality. Bills. Bills. Of course, more bills. Wait a minute, honey. This is for you. There you go. - Thanks. - So how's the savings coming, Tina? - It's harder than I thought. - Especially when all you do is shop. - I don't shop as much as you think, really. It's just the day to day stuff like gas, food, the basics. - So have you saved up anything since you've been working at the spa? - Yeah, like 100 bucks. - 100 bucks, T? You cannot live here forever, honey. - I know, Sheena. I don't plan to live here forever, trust me. - Trust me? What's that supposed to mean? - Nothing. Okay, Sheena, I'm trying. And I have plans. They just haven't been working as quickly as I thought they would. - It's no secret, Tina, that you're the least responsible of us all. But if I don't push you, you'll be here for the next 10 years doing the same thing. That's not cool. - Like you? - Excuse me? - I am not like you or Deena. Oh. - I refuse to get stuck and just work to pay bills. - I am not stuck. I love. I like what I do a lot. Okay, if you say so. Hm. You know, at least Deena complained about her job nonstop because you know I think you've been fooling yourself so long, you really believe you're happy. I can own up to my irresponsibility in the past. But I am trying. And if I'm not saving money quickly enough for you, then maybe I should just leave. - Wait, before you do that, you forgot one. The light bill. You can't pay it again this month, can you? - I'll figure it out. Oh, god. - What time is it? - It's gotta be somebody in your family calling this time of night. - Oh, lord. - Gotta be one of your relatives. - No, it's my relatives. - I bet you they want some money. How much you want to bet me? - $50. - Hello? - Hey Daddy, it's me. - Hey, darling. How's daddy's favorite daughter? - Daddy, don't give me that. Why didn't you guys tell us that Thad was coming into town? - Thad? He's in Atlanta? - Yeah, he was at Deena's a couple of hours ago. - Honey, we had no idea. Well, you know Thad. He moves like the wind. - Well, the wind blew him and his friend into town. - Ava. Is she there? - Sure is. - We like her. They seem pretty serious to me. Don't they? - Yeah, they sure do. - Ooh, how's Tina? - I'm glad you asked. I'm sending her back to you guys. - Oh, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. You can stop that right there. No, you're not. That's exactly why we sent her to you. - You guys tricked me. Tina is totally clueless about the real world. I can't. - We know that, Sheena. We were hoping that you and your sister would rub off on her. - Exactly. - Well, it's not working. I don't know what to do. - Don't think we don't know. All she does is look at you with those big, pretty eyes and beg you not to make her pay a bill. Don't think your mother and father don't know that. - Well, Mother and Father, I have to go and get ready for work tomorrow. Somebody's got to keep the lights on. - Nice talking to you, darling. Tell your brother to give us a call. - I will. Love you guys. - Love you, baby. - Love you, too, darling. - Night. Kisses. - Please don't bring her working butt back over here. - Oh no. - The freeloader. - I can't handle it. I can't handle it. - Oh, my god. - I can't handle it. - Oh, my god. - That is definitely your child. - That's your child. - Your side of the family. - No, that's your side of the. All righty. - Woo. Thank you, sister. Yes. That's the least I can do. I needed that. - You used to come all the time. Why'd you stop? - Because you made me start paying. - Girl, you and Tina take free to a whole 'nother level. - Is this it for you, Sheena? - What? What do you mean, like my end all, be all? My purpose in life? - Yeah, I guess. Like, did you think you were gonna end up here at Dolce Vita doing this for the rest of your life? - I mean. When I was a kid, did I imagine being here right now doing this? No. - Yeah, I get it. - What's up, Deena? - Nothing, I just. I've been thinking about my next move, you know. But I'm really proud of Thad for going for it. - Deena, Thad has a wife now. Way more responsibilities than before. I just think he should take that more seriously than chasing some fly by the night career in music. I mean, to each his own. - Well, in that case, never mind what I was gonna say. I mean, no, no, no. I'm listening. What were you gonna say? - Okay. If I tell you, promise you're not gonna laugh. - Well you're funny, so I can't promise that. - I'm being serious. Okay. - If you laugh, I'm never gonna tell you anything personal again. - I won't laugh. What? Can I laugh now? Okay. Okay, what? - I wanna sing again. Really? - I had something in my throat. - You're such a liar. No, something in my throat. I coughed. - You're just gonna laugh right in my face? - I was coughing, Deena. - You know what? Forget it, whatever. You can laugh, I don't care. You know, it's just since I got fired, I've had a lot of time on my hands. A lot of time. And I've just been thinking, you know. And I've been listening to my own thoughts for once. - So now you want to sing again? - I've always wanted to sing. I never wanted to stop. It just always seemed like it was impossible. And I found one of our old tapes. And then Thad comes into town, and he's getting back into music. And I just, it just feels like all the signs are there. - Deena, I hear you, but that was a long time ago. - Yeah, but we should have made it back then. We were that good. You know we were good. - You're serious, huh? - Yeah. I haven't truly been happy since I was 16. - D, there is nothing wrong with remembering good times. Those times were amazing. - But it's not fair. We never got closure. What if we kept going? - I mean, what if this, Deena? What if that? I'm just not one to look back, especially at this point in my life. - You talk like we're old women or something. We're only in our 20s. We can still do it. It's not too late. - It is for me. I have a job. Bills to pay. - Tell me you don't think about it. Tell me you don't miss it. Wow. Okay, brother. Look at you. Looking all sharp. I've never seen you this dressed up before. - Oh, come on, man. You know I always been a dresser. - Mm hm. Okay, hip-hop. Yeah, you were like an urban dresser. But this is different. I like it. - Hey, you gotta look the part to play the part, little sis. I mean, I gotta play the part out here with these big boys. And the big girls, for that matter. - Well, I've never seen you this serious about anything. I'm kind of jealous. - Jealous of what? - Look at you. You risked everything to follow your dreams. - Hey, I figured like, we ain't getting no younger. I figure I had to stop pretending to be Joe Jackson and get out here and make it happen. - Yeah. Speaking of Joe Jackson. What would it take for you to manage me? - Manage you? Man, I'd do that for free. - Yeah? - I just don't have the time right now, sis. I mean listen, this artist that I'm working with, if I can get him signed by any of the labels that's looking at him, me and Ava could retire right now and start a family. - Hm. - What you up to, Deena? - What? What you talking about? - You're up to something. 'Cause you ain't really giving me no flak about letting me and Ava stay with you. It was way too easy. - Okay. You got me. Okay. So here it is. I know you have to focus on your big time artist and everything, but what do you think about managing me? - You? - Yeah. I'm a sure thing, you know that. Listen, ever since my boss fired me, I've been doing a lot of soul searching. And I think that the group needs to get back together again. - Wait, hold on. Sheena is not trying to relive the glory days. You know she ain't no risk taker. Tina, you got a chance. Or you could just enjoy the memories. - No see, like memory lane, that's for the people who gave up on their dreams. We were good, Thad. You know we were good. - I know that. I just, I really don't have the time right now. Come on. You know if I could, I would. Are you guys ready to order? - Just give us a couple more minutes. All right, take your time. - Thank you. Okay. You know what? It's cool. I'll figure something out. You know, I got some old contacts. I'll just call them up and I'll work it out. - Sis, I know you're gonna make it happen. I know you. And you know I'll be right here waiting on you when it do. - I can't believe that you've been here less than a week and you're already doing makeup for celebrities. - Yeah. - I tried to tell you, man, I had connections here. One day, you're gonna stop doubting me. I told you I'm about to shut this spot down. - Yeah, I was shocked, too, Deena. But I did her makeup this morning for a television show. - Wow, that is awesome. Well you know I'm gonna need you to do my makeup one day as soon as I get a manager. - Whatever. Hey. - Sorry to interrupt movie night, guys. - What are you doing here? - I need a place to stay. Sheena and I got into it again. - Oh, yeah. You can definitely stay as long as you need to. - Hey, what happened? - I'm just tired of Sheena hovering over me, my life, everything. I can't take it anymore. - Well, you know how Sheena is. I think it has something to do with her being the middle child or something. But yeah, stay as long as you need to, sis. - Okay. This is just until I get a few things that I've been working on in line and then that's it. I'm out. - No worries. I'll talk to her tomorrow, and you just focus on you getting yourself together, okay? - Thank you, Deena. - Oh, you don't have to thank me. You're my baby sis. So you can take the room across from my room. Cool? And then, you know what? You should come back down and watch a movie with us. - Oh. Maybe tomorrow. You know, I'm pretty tired. I'm just gonna go upstairs and crash. Goodnight, guys. - Goodnight. - Goodnight. - Aw. She's so sweet. - She is. I love my baby sis. - Me, too. - Let me get up, baby. I'll be right back. - Oh, hurry back, baby. - Oh, get a room. I got one. - Oh yeah, in here. Hey, Deena? - What? - Where you keep the trash bags at? - They're under the kitchen sink. I don't see them. - Just look. They're under there. I don't see 'em. - Oh, my goodness. That's your husband. That's your brother. - Oh, you didn't even look. Here. - Thank you, wait. Come here, come here. - What? - Come here. You know this could actually work in your favor, right? - What? - Tina being here. - Oh. But it's not even Tina that I have to worry about. It's Sheena whose arm I have to twist. But remember, it's not your problem. - But remember, it's ain't your problem. - I heard that. Hey. - Hey. - I wanted to say everything's gonna be okay. - Oh, yeah. I know. I mean, I don't have my whole life figured out, but. I want to get things together on my own. By myself. - I wanted to run something by you, if that's cool. - Okay. Okay. What's up? - I want you to be real honest, okay? What would you think about me singing again? - Really? - Yeah. - I think that's great. - Yeah? - Yeah. I'll totally support you. Go 'head. - Oh, wow. Okay. Second question. - Okay. - What would you say to me asking you if you would sing with me? - Oh. I'd say that's the craziest thing that I've heard in a long time. - Yeah, I figured that. It's cool. - Then I'd say. Sure. - Shut up. Really? - Yeah. Yeah. - Oh my god, Tina. I can't believe you just said yes. - Now my schedule is tough, but if we can work around it, I'm in. - Oh, my god, yes. I mean, nothing would get in the way. Totally around your schedule. I can't believe you just said yes. Oh, my god. - Yeah. - Wow. Oh. That's cool, but. Now we gotta figure out a way to ask Sheena to join in. - Mm. Good luck with that. I do not want any part of it. - You really have no idea what this means to me. Oh my god, thank you. Mm. Thank you. - Let's go. Yeah man so listen, like I said man, $3 million? You crazy. Look, I'm not taking nothing less than five million. Uh huh. Yeah, I mean that's what I do. Right, listen man, hey, when y'all get through going over these numbers, man, like I said, I'm not taking nothing less than $5 million cash. Look, I gotta go, man. I got this meeting right now with Taylor Powell, and I got something I'm working on, so I'm gonna call you back. All right, five million, man. All right, later. What's going on, man? - Who are you? - I'm Thaddeus, but you can just call me Thad. I got this meeting with Taylor Powell. I think I spoke with you earlier this week, right? - You're who? - Yeah, Thad. I got a meeting with Taylor Powell. And you know, is she coming? 'Cause I gotta go. I got other stuff to do. - Taylor Powell. The Taylor Powell? The biggest music producer in the country? - Yeah. This is her office, right? - Oh, yeah, yeah. You're in the right place. But you don't have a meeting with Taylor Powell. - Okay. Okay, okay, okay, you got me. You got me. Now, look. I need your help, brother. - Help with what? - Listen, man, I moved out here from Miami. You know, I'm grinding, I'm doing this. I got this artist, man, and this artist, he's dope. He's about to blow all these clowns out the water. Man, trust me. And I just need for you to let me talk to Taylor for like three minutes. - Look, no offense, but I've heard it all, okay? If I had a nickel for every person that came through that door looking for me to make their dream happen, I'd be sipping fruity drinks at my seaside villa in the Canary Islands. - So there ain't nothing I could tell you or do that would let me talk to Taylor? - No. And have a good day. And let's not make this a security issue. Leave on your own two feet. - Point taken. Figured I'd just save you the trouble. Hello? Oh yeah, what's going on, man? Listen, everything is gonna work out just fine. It's nothing to worry about. You got my word on that. Oh no, look. That was only one meeting, man. Oh, come on. You can't bail on me like that now. Listen man, I moved out here because of you. We're a team. Okay, okay, listen, listen, look. Trust me, I know you're rolling the dice with me, man, but we're a team, bro. So you gon' just give up on me like that? What you mean you got a better offer? No, you know what? I'll see you at the top. - I finally get you all to myself. - You are such a spoiled little brat, you know that? - What? We haven't spent any time since you got here. - Well, you the one live all the way on the other side of town. - That was by design, honey. Trust me, Deena and I need our space. - Mm. Well, what made you leave the house in the first place? I mean, especially since all y'all moved down here together. - It's called independence, Thad. I never planned on living with Deena. - Okay. So, what made Tina decide who she was gonna live with? - Well, she thought we would get along better. - Oh. Well, you know she came by Deena's house the other night. Right? And she was really mad. - Whatever. She's just mad because I'm making her pay bills. Once Deena puts the pressure on her, she'll be back. - Well, Deena ain't making her pay no bills. She said she wanted to help her out so she could just focus on her school. - Tina is not interested in school. I know her game. Deena will see, and so will you, Thad. - Okay. Tina ain't no baby no more. And y'all need to stop treating her like one. - Honestly, I'm over it. If Tina wants to waste time, that's on her. - Yeah, well, at least she ain't working no dead end job pretending to love her life. - Thad, take that back. - Nope, 'cause it's true. - No, it's not true. I love my job. I like it a lot. Deena asked you about singing in the group again. Yeah and? We're grown women now with bills to pay. Ain't nobody got time for that. Oh, so grown women, if they got bills to pay, they still don't have to follow a dream? So let me guess. Tina's on board now that she's over there with Deena. Yep. She all in. Me, too. - You? Doing what? - I'm their manager. - Wait a minute. So what happened to your little artist? - Look, sometimes you plan stuff in life and it just don't work out, okay? - Well, I wish you, Tina, and Deena the best. I'ma pull a wild card and say that Ava's doing the hair and the makeup. - Yep. She sure is. - Well, I'll be front and center rooting for you guys. Don't even look at me like that. No, no, no, no. - Come on, Sheena. Look, I just need you in the group until I got time to replace you with a third girl. Please? Pretty please. Pretty, pretty, pretty, pretty, pretty please? - Okay. I've never been able to tell you no. Ugh. - Thank you. So we got a deal, right? - Hm. - Come on, sis. You know I can't do this without you. - Whatever, Thad. - Well, let's make it easy. Oh. - God. Ava. It's ridiculous. A marketing plan? - She's nowhere near as tall as she looks on television. And she's very short. - Really? - Yes. - Wait. Is that all of her hair, too? - I don't know. I really don't know. Hey, Deena. Hey, guys. Ava, do you have a minute? Can we talk? - Sure. I'll catch up with you. - Yeah. - What's up? You okay? - I would actually be a little better if I didn't have to come home to a messy house every day. - What mess are you talking about? - Are you serious? I mean, from the dirty dishes in the sink every single day to the fact that you've turned my living room into a dressing space. - I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I guess Thad didn't tell you that I could be a little junky at times. I'm sorry. - Yeah, he didn't say anything about that. Listen. Thad is your husband. Mm hm. - And maybe he thinks it's cute that you're a real messy person, but I don't. This is the second time that. - Second time? - Yeah, it's the second time that I've had to say something. - Well, this is the first time that I'm hearing of it. - Well, I told Thad the first time. - I'm a big girl. You don't have to go to Thaddeus about me. If you have any problems, good or bad, please feel free to come to me directly. - Not a problem. So, how about we consider this me coming to you directly? Ava, I'm asking you to please clean up behind yourself because this little piggy, messy behavior that you've been displaying is starting to rub me the wrong way. - Well, it's good to know what's expected of me. - Before you start on me, I know that I left a mess here. I was working late last night, and then I knew I had to, you know, get up early in the morning. I'm sorry. - No Tina. This marketing plan. This is amazing. I had no idea you were back in school. I mean, I saw you looking at online classes but. This is really good. Like, you should have told me. I would have supported you. - Really? Supported me? You don't have to pretend. Sheena doesn't even support me. - Okay, I'm really offended that you compared me to Sheena right now, but I don't feel the same way. Like, I wish you would have said something to me because I'm really proud of you. - Thank you, sis. You know. I'm just I'm really scared because for once I want to prove something to myself. You know? That I can see something through and actually finish it. - Well, I believe that you can do it. I have no doubts. Plus, you're a Dempsey. - And you know. I've been taking my classes and not to brag or anything, but I have A's in both of them, so. - Well hey, maybe you can put something together for the group. - Yeah, maybe. Look. Don't be too hard on her. She's really cool. - We have rehearsal in 15, okay? Yes, Deena. I'm just going upstairs to change. I'll be right back. - First of all, I don't believe in one lead. If she has a bad week, you need to be able to step up enough to carry the group. Now, you can have her to do background for a performance, but you gotta step up. Now, it doesn't always work for every group, but you all sing very well, I think you can pull it off. - Absolutely. - Speaking of, where is Sheena? - Oh, Sheena's running a little bit late, but she's finishing up a massage and she's on her way. She's coming as quick as she can. - I'm here. I'm here. I'm here, hi. - All right, you know the drill. We're right in the middle of our warm-up exercises. Okay, come on, ladies. La la la la la la la La la la la la la la - Okay now, drop your jaw, use your diaphragm. Do it again. La la la la la la la La la la la la la la - Very good, very good. Now, we're gonna sing a song, an old song. A song that everybody knows. But I want you to sing this song like you've never heard it sung before. Make it your own. Own this song, okay? - What song is that? - "Old Macdonald." - "Old Macdonald"? - Yes, Old Mc. A song is a song. A real singer makes you listen with your heart and with your soul. It's not about the words anyway. Would you prefer "Mary Had a Little Lamb"? - Absolutely not. - All right well then, let's sing, ladies. Okay. Old Macdonald had a farm E-I-E-I-O - No, no, no, no. We are not in a daycare. This is not a daycare. I need you to sing that song like you're singing The National Anthem at a stadium where there's thousands and thousands of people watching you. Now, sing it, ladies. Come on. Old Macdonald had a farm E-I-E-I-O On that farm he had a dog E-I-E-I-O - Bravo. Beautiful, ladies. That was very good. - Hey. - Good morning. What are you doing up so early? - I was just about to call you. I didn't want to have breakfast alone. - Oh Sheena, why don't you just call Tina and tell her that you miss her and that you want her to move back? - Never. What's up, Deena? - Girl, nothing. Ooh. Girl, why did I have to confront Ava about her mess last night? - What did she say? - Do you know that she had the nerve to even try to like. - What, stand up to you? - Exactly, but I was right and she was wrong. Listen, if she does not clean up after herself, she's gonna have to find somewhere else to live. - Deena, take it easy. Are you sure you're not just jealous? - Jealous of what? - The fact that I don't know, she married Thad. You and him used to be super close. It's okay, just admit it. - Okay, something is seriously wrong with you. I am not jealous of Ava marrying Thad. That's ridiculous. - Yeah, okay. Mm hm. - I will call you later, sister. - Are we still on for the studio tonight? - Yes. I will see you at five. - All right, I'll call you after church and ride with you. - Okay, bye. - Bye. - Girl crazy. Talking about I'm jealous of Ava. - This is not gonna end well. - Girl, please. - You didn't know about her? - Looks like somebody can't hang. Mm. - Looks like somebody needs to take a chill pill. - Oh, what? - Deena, come on, man. What's up with you going off on Ava yesterday? - Oh, geez. I need you to ease up, for real. - Ease up, are you serious? Well, I need her to clean up after herself. How 'bout that? - Deena, it's not about being right. It's about your delivery. She's not a kid. - My point exactly. She's a grown woman who leaves a mess all over the house. I'm not her maid, Thad. - Wow. You really need to relax. - Okay, whatever. I'm not even gonna have this conversation with you right now. This is ridiculous. Ooh. I am super excited about studio tonight. - Yes, me, too. Yeah, it'll be fun. - What, five o'clock, right? For like, what, three hours? - Yeah, but I have to work, so I'll be there as soon as I can. - Will Ava still come tonight to do our makeup? What? We have head shots tonight, Thad. - I remember. She'll be there. But I need you to call the witch hunt off now. - Are you serious? Witch hunt? It's not a witch hunt. I just want her to clean up after herself. - Deena, you called her a pig. Come on. That was not necessary and it hurt her feelings. - Deena? - What? I apologized and I did not say she was a pig. Now she's taking my words out of context. What I said was that she reminded me of a little piggy because she leaves a mess behind her all the time. - Thad, Deena's jealous of Ava. - Sheena, if you don't stop saying that, we're gonna fight. - You are. You're jealous of the fact that she married a great guy, our brother, we love you and that he might love her just a little bit more than he loves you. - Please. Whatever. - Wait, hold on. So that's what this is about? - I think. - No. - Look Deena, I love Ava. That is my wife. - Oh. - But you are my little sister. Nobody can ever take your place, okay? - I don't know, Thad. I mean, just growing up, you and I were so close and we used to hang out and talk all the time. And now. I don't know. I've never seen you act like this. - Deena, you should be glad I'm happy. I finally met a good girl that I made my wife. - Okay. You're right. You're all right. I'm sorry. I promise I will try and be better. I promise. - Thank you. - Okay. Now that that's out the way, let's move on to more important things. We still haven't chosen our single. And we need to do it like now. We're recording tonight. Okay. - "Sweet Life." Mm hm. - Yeah, I like this one, too. It's a nice, little upbeat, and I think all three of y'all got a good handle on that. - Yeah, me too. This is my first choice. - Me, too. - Yeah, me too. - Okay. - Did we all just agree on something? - Ew, I think so. - Wait, hold up, hold up. Hold up. Stop. - What? - We got a lot to do in a little bit of time. And so I think it's best for everybody to know that we're all on the same page. Cool? - Cool. - Speaking of being on the same page. I was thinking of group names all night and I came up with one. - What? - Ready? - Yes. - Three-Vas. - You say what now? - Three-Vas. - Wait, hold on. Three-Vas like in three divas? - Mm hm. Yeah, exactly. What, you guys don't like it? - Wait, hold up. Deena, listen. Let me come up with the name for the group, okay? - No, Tina, come on? - Yes, bro, I'm with you. - Little sister? I just knew you would love it. It's cute, it's catchy. - Sorry, sis. Look, let me come up with the group name. You've been out the game a little bit. Three-Vas? - Boy please. Three-Vas is trash. I'ma just keep it 100 with you. That's kind of garbage. - That was so disrespectful. - One more time and I think we'll have what we need. - How are we doing on time, Ozzy? Did we go over? - Just a little bit, but no worries. - Okay, thank you. - Don't mention it. It's $50 for every 10 minutes over the time booked and we're about an hour over so far. - Ooh. Okay well, we're ready. Let's go. - Well. - Ah. - That was incredible. - It really, really was. I don't want to waste this makeup job, so I think I'm going to have to go out tonight. - Oh. - Hey, I'm not gon' lie. Y'all ladies did y'all thing tonight. Like, for real. Baby, did you see the look on Ozzy's face when they hit that one note? - Yes, I did. He could not believe it. You guys are awesome. - Thank you. - Hey, Ava? I wanted to take the opportunity to say this while we were all here. I wanted to say thank you and you did an amazing job on our makeup tonight. And you really came through for us tonight, especially after what I said to you. I'm sorry. - No problem. - No, it's not. Like, I shouldn't have talked to you like that. And it's not right. Like, our dad worked a lot when we were younger, and Thad was more than just a brother to us. He was kind of like a father figure, so yeah. - Deena, I'm not going to take him away from you, though. - I know, I know. I have to understand that it's not a subtraction and it's more like an addition. Right. - And you're like a sister. So, I wanted to say welcome to the family and I am sincerely sorry. - Oh. Oh, I guess I forgive you, but I am still a little junky. But I will work on it. I promise. I will. - Growth. - So, we all on the same page now? - Yes, we are. We are absolutely on the same page. - Amen. - Now exactly, why are you helping me? - I've seen a lot of people come through these doors. They all have different angles, but everybody wants the same thing, a chance. Truth is, I used to be just like them. Just like you. I guess something happens to people when they make it. You forget about all the rejection. And I couldn't get that look on your face out of my head when you threw your hard work in the trash. You know, I've been on this side of the door so long that I forgot what it feels like to be locked out. To want something so bad that you can taste it. - Wow. That's deep. - Back in the day, I was looking for a deal as a solo artist. And when I finally met Taylor Powell, she made me her personal stylist and assistant instead. Ooh Ah, ah Ah Guess it's good I got out of the way to make room for people in the game like yourself, huh? - Yeah. That's good. - Yeah. Well, here's the deal. I got you a quick 15 with Taylor. - Wait. Taylor Powell? When? - Now. Good luck. Taylor Powell, Thad Dempsey. - Nice to meet you. Nice to meet you. - So, what you got? Hm. Yeah, do you know how many people come in here expecting me to make their dreams come true? - Hey, I could only imagine. - So, what makes you different? Or your group for that matter? - Okay. That photo that you got right there. Mm hm. - Those three women on that picture. Those are my little sisters. Now, I know I might sound biased, but they good. They're really good. And I'll do anything for my little sisters. Look, I'm not going to lie to you. When I moved out here, I was representing a totally 'nother R&B artist. He left me for another manager and I was devastated. But my sister lost her job, and she came to me, asked me to manger her. And she hooked back up with my sisters to relive our old dream. - So they used to sing? - Well yeah, they used to sing, but a dream is still a dream, right? - True. - And only a dreamer would understand that. - Let me ask you. How good are they? They good. - They're good. Are they ready? - Absolutely. - Okay. I got a proposition for you. - Miss Norman? - Yes? - Deena's here to see you. - Hi. - To what do I owe this unexpected visit? Ashley, you know that package I had? Would you get that off my desk? - I just wanted to come by and say thank you. - Thank me for what? - I finally realized why you let me go. So, I wanted to come and say thank you for firing me 'cause had you not, I probably would have been here for god knows how long, and going through the motions, like you said. So, thank you. - Well, I'm happy that you finally understood and you didn't hate me forever. - Oh, no. I don't hate you. - So, what have you been doing with your time? - I took your advice. And I. I'm breathing and I am living and I'm enjoying life. - And doing some determined dreaming, I hope? - Absolutely. I am finally doing what I love. - Oh. Yes, thank you. - Well, I am so happy, and I want you to know that I am behind you 100 %. You need anything, I want you to let me know. - I will. Thank you so much. I appreciate that, Olivia. But I don't want to keep you. I just wanted to stop by. - No, no, Ashley, Ashley. Thank you. You know, it is. It's not a coincidence. I should expect it by now but. I was actually gonna send you this. - Oh. Wow, Olivia. I can't take this. I could never pay it back. - It's a gift. It's a gift. - Wow. Thank you. - Oh. Mm. - Sorry. - You know, my grandmother loved the beach. And she was a businesswoman in her day. That's where I got it from. But she left me with this saying. She said if you have enough energy swimming back to shore, that you didn't swim hard enough on the way out. - Yeah. - So, don't worry about the swim back, okay Deena? - Thank you, Olivia. - You're welcome. Come here. - Thank you. Mm. - Oh, my god. - All right, all right, all right. Calm down, calm down. We got a whole lot of details to work out and only got a couple days to do it. - Ooh. - Oh my god. Taylor Powell? - Yes. - Wants us to sing at her aunt's private party? - Exactly. - I can't even. I can't believe it. - Anything is possible, ladies. - Hey, look. Somebody is definitely watching out over us. Yes. - We only got one chance. We cannot blow it. - We got this. - Yes. Hey, guys. I'm home. Tina? Thad. Ow. - You cannot just throw it on there like that. - I'm sorry. - Are you okay? - Yeah, I just. I shouldn't have been carrying all that stuff. I just didn't want to make two stupid trips. - See. - Hm. - Guys, it's really okay. It's just an ankle sprain. So it'll heal quick. Thad? Are you crying? - No, I'm good. I ain't crying. I ain't cried since the '90s, man. - Honey, you cried at the family reunion two years ago. I remember. - Ain't nobody talking about me crying. - Why are you guys? Why do you guys look so tense? I mean, what were you guys talking about before I came in? Oh, my gosh. Did she kick you out, Ava? - Are you really pointing fingers at me? I didn't kick her out. - No, she didn't. - No. - Really. She didn't. Thad was just telling us some great news. Really great. - Oh. Okay. Well, is somebody gonna tell me this great news? - Okay, we're performing this weekend at Taylor Powell's private event. - Oh yeah, ow. You gon' be ready? - Are you kidding me? Of course, I'm going to be ready. I'm not gonna let y'all down. It's just a little sprain. I am so sorry, Thad. I can't believe that it's actually broken. - Oh, don't worry about it, little sis. You ain't do it on purpose. You just relax. Can I get you anything? - Can I have a glass of water, please? - Yeah, yeah. I got you. - Thanks. If she's gonna be your friend, then be it If you're not, then don't Don't take it - Deena sounding good. No No, no, no Hey Hey Yeah, yeah, yeah Ooh - Baby, you could sing? - Ah. Thad, you scared me to death. - I'm sorry, baby. - It's okay. I'm making your favorite. Stove top lasagna. Woo. Mm mm. Mm mm. No. No, Thad. I'm not doing it. - Come on, baby. You have to. - No. - Look, Tina got hurt. We don't have time to find a third girl. It. How did I not know you knew how to sing? - Because I sing alone. That's why. - But baby, your voice is amazing. - I am a makeup artist, not a singer. - No. You're a makeup artist who happens to have an amazing voice. And you're my wife. And I need you to help me out of this jam please. - So, you're playing the wifey card, really? - Yes. - Really? So, you want me to sing for Taylor's event? - Yes. Look, Tina got hurt. I could explain her getting hurt, but I cannot show up to that event with two girls. Come on, baby, please? Please? Please? - One time. One. One time. - Mm, that's my baby. That's what I'm talking about. Hey, I'm gon' be right back. Let me go tell the girls. Yo. - Oh. Get out of here. If you're gonna be a friend then - Oh, my god. Tonight was amazing. I didn't expect to feel so comfortable after all these years. - Yeah. It was like coming home. - So. What did you think about Ava? - She was actually really good. A little bit of a limelight hog, but other than that. - But you got to admit, she did not miss a beat. She hit every note on point, honey. - Okay, don't go getting attached, 'cause you know it's only temporary until Tina starts feeling better. - Deena, don't be a dang on jerk. We're lucky to have Ava. She's pretty good. - Yeah, you're right. - Mm. Girl, I should get going. I got a long drive home and I am beat. - Why don't you just stay here? 'Cause you know you don't like going home and being alone without Tina being there. - Yeah, you're right. I hate it. I should just move in, too, huh? - Shoot, might as well. Everybody else here. - All right now, Motel 6. One night at a time. Okay, cool. I'ma take a shower and then get in the bed. - Okay. I love you. - I love you. Hey. Listen. I wanted to say thank you, because I know that this was my dream and it wasn't yours. So, I just wanted you to know that there was no way that I could've done this without you. So, thank you. - Thank you, D, but. I was just a little afraid to admit that it's actually my dream, too. I just didn't see it as being practical. But I have not been this happy in years. I owe you one. I love you. I love you, too. Night night. - Night night. And I want a big breakfast in the morning. Eggs, pancakes, bacon, turkey bacon. - Mm hm. Fresh squeezed orange juice. All of that, okay? - Would you like your morning paper, too? - Oh, yeah. You know it. - Girl, bye. Go to bed. - Hey. - Oh hey. - How's it going? The ladies ready? - Oh, yeah, they good. - That's good. So, my aunt is always late, but she should be here in a few minutes. Would you like something to drink? - Oh, no, I'm good. We're just excited to do our thing. Exactly where are they performing at? - That would be where the three microphones are. - I'm sorry. I didn't even see that. - Just relax, relax. My aunt is the one that you want to impress. You get past her, you're good. Let Andre know if you need anything. - Okay. Okay. - Thank you. - You got it. - Thad. - Hey. - Hey, these girls better be little songbirds. I really put my neck out there for you. - Hey look, I won't let you down. I promise. - Good because if I lose my job, I'm coming after you and your whole family. - The guest of honor has finally arrived. - Hi, how you doing? Thad Dempsey.

Oh and glamorous. Look at this. - Wow. I can't believe you never told me that Taylor Powell was your niece. - I can't believe that I didn't know you could sing. - Wow. I can't believe that I am sitting in Taylor Powell's house, and then to find this out. This is crazy. - This is fate. See what happens when you move towards your purpose? - Yes. - Mm. - Well, we're gonna leave. Our job is done. - Oh. - But I hope you enjoyed your birthday surprise. - I did so much. And Taylor is going to get a fabulous recommendation from me. - Oh, thank you, Olivia. Wow. How's your new girl working out? - Oh, she'll do, but she's not you. - Bye, Olivia. I know right. - Oh my god. Keep your fingers crossed. This could be it. - I wonder what they're talking about. Does she look excited? I don't know. Ooh. - Oh, wow. Look at that. It's finally here. Can you believe it? What? - Oh, god. Okay, let's go, let's go. - Okay so, Thad should be here any minute now. - Oh my god, I'm so nervous. I wonder what Taylor said. - There's no need to speculate, D. Just be patient. We'll just have to wait 'til he gets here, okay? - Yeah. - It's him. I hear him. It's him. He's here. - Really? - Yeah. - Woo. I am starving. Come on, you pray. - Okay. - God is good. God is great, amen. Amen. - What did she say? - Can we eat first? - No. What did she say? - Okay. They want to sign us. - Yes. - It's a small deal, you know, just 'til they see how everything work out, but. - Oh, my god. We have a deal. - We got a hard decision to make though. - About what? - What? - Well, the decision is. - What, they want us to cut our hair? - Color it. Dye it beach blonde? - Curl it? - What, honey, what? - They don't want a four girl group. - That's perfect. - Okay. - There's only three of us. - Yeah well, Ava been kind of loving what y'all been doing recently, and she came to me last night and said she was actually considering stop doing makeup to continue to do this. - I forgot about Ava. Well Thad, Tina was here first. - Yeah, I know, I. Ava did come through in a clutch, though, right? - Yeah and we appreciate that. You know? But she knew it was temporary. I mean, A, Tina's our sister. She's an original member. We can't ask her to leave. - Yeah. - Yeah, I know. I just really wish they'd consider a four girl group. That's all. But they said they don't like to work with four just three. It's all good. I guess I'll just have to break it to Ava. - Oh, I'm so sorry, Thad. I love you. I really love Ava, too. It's okay. - Hey, girls. - What are you smiling for? - Hey. - Hi. How was your day? - Well, I'm off crutches, as you can see. But, still have to wear this hideous boot for a week. - Aw. Well, how was your day, Ava? - Awful. My clients are so high maintenance. And this one lady, she is such a challenge, okay. Hey, baby. How you? What's wrong? You all right? - Yeah, how did the meeting with Taylor Powell go? - Yeah? - Oh, it went good. They want to sign us to a deal. - What? Oh, my god. That is awesome. Why aren't you guys celebrating right now? Why are we? - Well, I kind of got some bad news. They don't want a four girl group. Just three. - That's okay, babe. It's okay. Really. It is. Look, at least it was fun while it lasted, right? I mean, it was always supposed to be temporary, anyway. I knew that. Okay? - Yeah, but you're devastated. And I know you. - No, baby. No, I'm not devastated. I just. It's just being in this group for the short amount of time, it helped me to realize that doing makeup is not what I want to do at all. I really don't love it. - You love singing, don't you? - I like it a lot. A whole lot. But you know, that doesn't matter. It really doesn't. We don't have to make a decision here. I mean, La Dolce Vita consists of three members. Deena, Sheena, and Tina. Congratulations, girls. Hey, if y'all need backup, you know where to find me, okay? - We can do this then. Yes. So, what are we gonna wear? Like, who's gonna like, style us, like? - No, no, no, no. - No, what? - I don't want to sing. - What are you talking about, honey? - I'm not singing. Come on, let's be real. This is. This is you guys' dream. Not mine. You've just been dragging me along like a rag doll or something. It's been like that my whole life, so of course I was fine with it. But it's always do this, do that. Sing, Tina. Say yes. Just go with our flow. It's okay, you're fine. Brush it off. - Are you serious right now? - Yeah. Yeah, I'm dead serious. I don't. I don't want to be in the group. I'm out of the group, okay? Problem solved. - Wow. I guess you don't say yes all the time. - Instead, I want to be in charge of the group's marketing and PR. - That's a big job. - I know. I'm ready for the challenge. And I can show you much better than I can tell you. - Okay. - So, it's settled then. Ava? You want this, you deserve it. You're in the group. I'm out of the group. Simple. It's not complicated. Doesn't have to be. - Okay. - You're right. It doesn't. - Wow. Well. I guess it'll take some time getting used to it. Ow. I mean, change is good. Change is real good. Welcome to the group, Ava. Yay. - Yes and welcome to the family. Yes. Ava, it's so nice to have you. - Sometimes life surprises you and things line up just right. No more of that dreadful clock. It's just me, my dreams, and my family working together to share our gifts and talents with the world. Turns out, I'm living a pretty sweet life. Looks like life just got a little sweeter.
