That's him. Come on, Bradley. Let's stay with him. Bring him around the corner of the car. You have the right to remain silent. Anything you say can and will be used against you in a court of law. You have the right to an attorney. If you cannot afford an attorney, one will be provided for you. Do you understand the rights I've just read to you? I ain't do nothing, man. Shut up. You say anything, I'll choke the breath outta you. And if he says anything else, put him in a wooden tuxedo. What do you want me to do? There are over a million guns out there. We're doing the best we can. You call the mayor and ask him that, I got bad guys to catch. Mean to tell me you caught the piece of shit. Yes. Putting a gun inside this particular suspect's mouth wasn't necessary this time? Was it Moses? No, Lieutenant. I don't do that anymore. That's a change. Why not? He didn't move or say word. Did you read him his rights? I read him his rights, Lieutenant. Good. It's all on audio tape, right? Most definitely. Hi. Hi. Hi. Hi. Who is it? Shippit. You okay? I'm having trouble breathing. Can I have a glass of water? Yeah. Come in. Come. You don't sound so good. I'll be fine as soon as I take my medicine. Okay. Well sit down. Let me get you some water. You mind if I sit here for just a minute? Yeah. I just need to catch my breath. Sure. You think you need a paramedic though? You wanna call 'em? Nah, I'd be fine. I just need a couple minutes for the medicine to work. Sure, take your time. You have a nice place. Thanks. You've been here long? Just moved in a month ago. What? Just moved in a month ago? It looked like you've been here for a while. Everything in place? Yeah. I work fast. Gotta keep everything organized. Want some more water? Thanks. I'll take it and get going. So what kind of work? What do you do for work? I'm in insurance. Oh yeah? What kind of insurance? All kinds. Hey, you wanna brochure before you go? Hey. Hey, sis. What are you doing here? Got off early? No, I left my wallet with my driver's license in it. Good thing you're a cop. Who's gonna stop you? The police, that's who. You still gotta be a law abiding citizen. What are you up to? Just reading about all this crime in New York City. Y'all have to get it together. It's crazy. Yeah, tell me about it. Six years of college and you become a cop? Can't you get another job? How many times I gotta tell you? It's a profession. Not a job, I am a professional. I don't care what you call it, it's still a dangerous way of earning a living. So what do you suppose I do instead? Find a rich husband. You're pretty enough. Nah, sister. You tried that already and look where it got you. Sitting on my couch. I'm an entirely different case. Case is right. I don't know who could put up with you. I beg your pardon? That man was crazy. I ain't no side bitch, I'm a boss. Cheating on me. I had to divorce him. I don't care how much money he had. Although I did get some of it. Hello? Moses, I need you at 177 Adam Clayton Boulevard right away. Okay. I gotta go. What happened? My profession needs me. We're gonna need a lot of good shots. Got 'em. Any witnesses? One. Come on. Hi, I'm Detective Moses. What's your name? Tamika Tally. So what did you see? A man. FedEx delivery man. He was carrying a small package. He seemed nice. He spoke to me and I spoke back. Then I walked by this apartment and noticed the door open, and saw the body. What did he say to you? Just hi, but it was weird. How so? He said "Hi" three times. What do you mean? He said, "Hi. Hi. Hi." Like that. Did he stutter? No. Just, "Hi. Hi. Hi.". In a kind of southern accent? That is weird. Well, thank you Miss Talley. You can go for now. Get verification on her just in case we need her. Got it. Detective Moses, can I have word with you? I ever tell you no. Well, there was the Barnes case. Okay, that one. So what do you wanna ask. Any specifics on this one? No clue. Witness says that she saw a man. FedEx worker. So, does that mean he killed her? No one else in the area at the time. The witness is the woman who found the woman dead. You know? The black community is on edge about all these murders by guns. But apparently a gun wasn't involved in this murder. Write what you wanna write, Perry. All right. I know as much as you do. Amsterdam News. Hi, I'm calling for Mr. Perry Austin. Speaking. Hello, Mr. Perry. I'm calling regarding an article you wrote, "Woman slain on Frederick Douglass Boulevard." Okay? There are no details. What do you mean? No facts? Is there something that you need to know? I just thought a newspaper with a reputation as good as yours would have more details on how she was slain. Do you know something more than what I wrote? You should. Do you think that specific information was botched up by the police? Tell me what you know. May I ask who's calling? No. You may not. That was fast. Where did you call me from? The staircase? Girl, you crazy. I called you from the car. What you gonna make? Spaghetti and a salad. And what about the meatballs? You know I don't eat meat. I'm talking about for me. I'm a New York City cop. I drink coffee. I eat donuts and burgers. Not your boring diet. That diet is not good for you, sis. I saw online today about the murder in the precinct. Oh, yeah? I assume they assigned you to the case. Well you assumed right. Imani, you have to get out. It's too dangerous. Murder is always the crime. People need somebody to call when they're in trouble. Have you ever thought about what life would be like without the police? It would be outta control. The human wolves would rule. And I am not about to let that happen. Whoever killed that lady on Frederick Douglas Boulevard had no human feelings. Oh, mercy. What do you want? I'm from the cable company. I'm here to adjust the ground line on your telephone. I didn't call no damn cable company. You don't have to be rude. Stop knocking on my damn door. Telephone power on your ground line is about to be cut off. Like, what? I was gonna put a special switch on your phone so you could still have service, but since you're so nasty, you won't have any service for three days. Wait, wait. No. Hey, hey. My dude. Please come back. Look, I need my phone. Look, I am sorry about my attitude. Just going through a couple of things. You know? Little stressed. It's okay. It's okay. Since you're a sister, I wanted to help you, but you blew it. No, no, no, no. Please look. Look, I need my phone. My phone line is not working. You should have thought about that when I approached your door. Look. Look. Please, please do not be angry with me. Look, I did not mean a snap at you. I'm just... Look, I didn't call no damn cable company. I mean, and you're knocking on my door so damn hard. Okay, okay. Let's hurry. I have other customers to help. Oh, Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. So, where are you from? Which part of the south? How you know I'm from the south. Your accent? Didn't anybody tell you, you have an accent? Alabama. So how long have you been in New York for? About 16 years now. How long you been in New York? My whole life. Born and raised. Where's the phone jack? Oh. Right... Right over here. All right? You all right? May I have a glass of water? Yeah, sure. Any luck? None. Why not call it a night? I gotta come up with something before I leave. Bradley, go home to your wife. I know I better go home to mine. You need a husband, Moses. You sound like my sister. Now your poor wife? Mm. No prints, no index numbers, FBI. We got nothing. Hi, Imani. Hi, Perry. What a surprise. What can I do for you? It's what I can do for you. What's that? I got a call from a man, and he wanted to know why the article on the murder was so small, and not detailed. What does that have to do with me? You're slipping, Imani. Maybe it's a suspect. Come on, Austin. I can't get hyped up every time a crazy person calls you. Why else would someone ask for that type of information. You mean to tell me you never got a call with someone asking something like that? Never. Really? I normally get calls when someone wants to make sure that the lottery numbers are accurate. Well, all I can say is that the murder was well thought out and very well executed. Well, thank you, Imani. For what? I knew an expert like you would come up with something. Austin, don't you print that. I never said our conversation was off the record. Bye, Imani. Looks like we got serial killer on our hands. So what did he say? I told him it could be any nut job. Hi, Detective Moses. Good morning, Austin. What can I do... Nevermind with the formalities, Miss Moses. I'm your problem, Detective. Problem? Perry, what's going on? Miss Detective Moses, I instructed Mr. Austin to call you. Who the hell are you? Allow me to introduce myself. I'm Band Aid. You may recall seeing one of my friends lying dead with a Band Aid on their forehead. Now, now, Detective Moses. I heard someone pick up. Now that is very rude. It is a private conversation, Imani. You and I. Okay, I'm here. Talk. Detective, you will be unable to trace me. I won't be on long enough. Now, you will find how intelligent I am, as we go, but I took the cap off the phone. What's a cap? You can't trace, Detective, so please, tell Detective Bradley to hang up. Okay, you can have your way, but... We were just discussing manners and you're are interrupting me. Now, where were we? Oh, yes. I'm presently in the home of December Green, victim number two. Where'd she go? She's very dead. Now I have your attention. I told Mr. Austin my appreciation of your quote. What quote? You don't remember something you quoted about something as important as a murder? Go ahead and remind me. You quoted, "The murder was very well thought out and very well executed." You wanna tell me how you did it? Now, Mr. Austin, I imagine I'll get a larger article in the newspaper about the next murder. Please tell him yes, Perry. Yes. I mean, although, I hope there isn't another murder. Now for you, Detective Moses. I suggest you come to 521 Amsterdam Avenue. Apartment 5F. What for? I apologize, Mr. Austin, I forgot to invite you. And Detective Moses, please invite Detective Bradley and the rest of the team. When you arrive, you'll see I've been up to my usual professionalism. What the hell did you do? Austin, let me have a word with you. We gotta know exactly what was said. Shouldn't Moses be here to hear this? No. She feels that you might print that she blew her nose talking to you about this deranged murderer. You gotta be kidding me. Don't you see the seriousness here? Look, I understand the first article and I know it's your standard procedure, but we gotta ask you to put a lid on the publicity. The public has a right to know. The public also has a right to be safe. Can't do it, detective. Austin, human life is in danger here. Freeze it until we can catch this nut job. Journalistic ethics, Detective. If it's news, I got a right to print it. Okay. Okay. Another Band Aid on the forehead. We can assume it's the same person. What'd he say? He's gonna freeze on other reporting? He said us against his ethics. Let me know if you find out something else that I don't see here. Asshole. This has gotta stop. Yes, this black on black crime, it gotta stop. It's getting outta control. Especially if the killer is black. Yeah, word. I got problems, detectives. I've got problems. I can't believe you two. It was an afterthought. That's all it was. An afterthought? You quote how great a killer he is, and that was an afterthought? You know how unreasonable Austin is? Yes, he is. Well, let's put him on another story, and that's catching this insane piece of shit. You want us to bring in the witness? Yes, bring her in. We need to talk to her. Miss Tally. Can I help you? Remember me? Of course I remember you. How are you feeling? Just fine. How are you feeling? Good. I need you to come to the station. It's pretty good. Is there anything else you can tell us, Miss Tally? That's about it, on his looks. Did he say anything to you? You know he... He locked eyes with me, just for a moment. And he said, "Hi. Hi. Hi." Three times, in a deep voice. Okay. Any more questions, Bradley? No. Moses? Nothing else. Come in. Hello, everyone. Hey, Eva. How you guys doing? Do y'all mind if I grab my husband? We have an engagement and we cannot be late. Emile has another concert at school? - Mm hm. - He does. What is he? A senior in high school? Yes, it's is last year. Can you believe it? He'll be off to college in a minute. Bradley, you're going to have to do a lot of overtime. Oh, I know. But, Lieutenant Robinson, on a serious note, I haven't seen the city's crime rate this bad, especially these murders. I sincerely hope we're doing everything we can to catch that lady's killer. That's the plan Mrs. Bradley. And I'm assuming a black man? Black on black crime. We need to be just as outraged as we are, when we kill each other, as when others kill us. We need to keep our community safe, and we need it now, for our future. We need to do it ourselves. I'm so proud to be married to a good black officer. Oh, that's detective to you. Come on, Detective. Let's get out. Bye, everyone. Now, that's love. Speaking of love, I must get home to my wife. You can leave now, Miss Tally. Oh, Lieutenant. The detectives just picked me up and told me I had to come with them at that instant. I didn't have a chance to go to my apartment so I don't have any money to get home. Which detective told you to come with them at that moment? Moses? Take Miss Tally home. I'll see you tomorrow. Yes, sir. Come on. What's up with walking me to my door? I told the lieutenant I needed a ride home, and not an escort to my door. You're a witness. I have to protect you to your door. Detective? My door's open. Stay here. What are you doing? Just shut up and stay here. I'm not playing any games. You understand? Aren't you gonna call for backup? Will you shut up!? You have another place to stay tonight? No. Well, I wouldn't recommend you stay here. If someone broke in, they could break in again. Do you live alone? My brother lives with me. You know, maybe I just left it open. You said I had to come with you at that second, so I didn't have a chance to come up to the apartment and check on things. I can take care of myself. If anything happens, I'll call the police. So you're not worried about a killer in this neighborhood, killing people? Not at all. God watches over me, detective. And my brother is a tough guy. Well, I can't make you do anything. So, thanks for your cooperation. You're welcome. And lighten up. Life's too short. Yeah. I'm sorry about what I said earlier. It's just a part of the job. Married? No. What's going on? The door was open. The apartment was open. The detective... It's a long story. Detective Moses, this is my brother, Byron. It's nice to meet you. My pleasure. What's the short of it? Well, your sister has a little information on a potential murder suspect. So, we came to take her to the police station to make a witness statement and upon returning, the apartment door was open. Tamika, did you leave the door open again? Maybe I did. I can't be sure. How many times do I have to tell you? Check the door before you leave. Detective Moses, please forgive my sister. No worries. I have to run. Take my card. Call if anything suspicious about the suspect pops up. If there's a break in, call 9-1-1. You know you're a really nice girl. I can see that. You deserve to be treated nicely, but you gotta be nice to yourself first. Thank you for saying that. I will remember that. Anyways, I have to go. Have a good night. Can I call you, sometime? Certainly. As long as it's pertaining to the murder in this building. Good night. You can't take the herbs that I give you and then turn right around and take Tylenol at the same time. You don't listen. Try to get some sleep before you have to go to work. Go to sleep, man. Who is it!? The plumber! I didn't call no damn plumber. We have orders to check the plumbing in this entire building. Well, it's an inconvenience for me right now. Can you come back later? Come on Miss. I got a job to do. Look, brother, I can't do it right now. You know, I hate to see you, as my black sister, treat me like this. If I was a white plumber, you wouldn't ask no questions. Could you keep it down? This is a quiet building. I have neighbors. Nah, you the third black woman to gimme a hard time. You know what I'm going to do? Cancel you. And when they asked me what happened, I will tell 'em that the foolish woman would not let me in, and therefore I had to determine... All right. All right. Come in, and just keep it down. The walls are thin. Dang, you beautiful. Get a grip, brother. What pipes do you need to look at? The kitchen is the best. Right over there. By the way. Can I offer you something to drink? Oh, you gonna be nice to me now. Please. Do you want a bottle of water? Do you want me to get you some breakfast, toast, eggs, dinner sometime. What's up with you? You're not supposed to hit on the tenants. Oopsy. I say. That's funny. I'll take that water. Excuse me for a moment. I'll be right back. Are you finished? Why are you whispering? Get with it. I have things to do. Oh, well you can get to 'em. I'm finished. Yeah, the pipes are fine. It was probably another apartment on the same pipeline where the clogs are. Good. Thanks. Oh, you... I see you have a lot of health products. What do you do? Sell them, or something? As a matter of fact, I do. Do you take vitamins? Nah, I don't. Well, that's not good. A lot of the vitamins and minerals are lost when the food is cooked. You have to supplement your meals. I eat good. Well how's your stress level? I don't need no vitamins. You know, I like to say this to you straight up, I see beautiful women like you on the street, elevators, you know, just anywhere. I just can't let this happen with you. Can I take you out to lunch one day soon? You're too much. Cup of coffee, maybe? I can sell you a bottle of vitamins for a discounted price of 29.99. $30 For a bottle of vitamins? They also help with stress, which I'm sure you have. You see how you bring your shoulders towards your neck? That's where all the tension is. Yeah. I can feel all that tension. What the fuck is going on? Nothing's going on baby. I'm just showing him where the tension is. And trying to sell me some vitamins. Who the hell are you? I'm the plumber. Plumber, my ass. Get the fuck out of my house. You better calm down. And who the fuck do you think you hollering at? Knives, guns. I don't give a fuck. I'm just as rough as the next motherfucker. People like you, lose their life fucking with me. Just leave, man. It's nice to have you finally home during the day, sis. I know, right? Why can't you catch this killer by now? Whoever it is is very clever. So... Tell me about this man you just met. Well, he is the brother of a witness on a case, and girl, he is fine. I see you like him? Yeah, well, I mean, I don't know him. I'd like to get to know him. I mean, I liked his vibe right away, and his sister said something really nice to me. I could tell they're really good people. What did she say? Well, she said that I'm a nice girl and I deserve to be treated nicely, but I need to treat myself nice first. What is it on my forehead that says I don't treat myself nice. She can see you don't focus on you. You focus on the job, and with all the horrible things you see, you forget to treat yourself nicely. That's what she means. Thank you, Dr. Crystal. Hello? Hi, Imani. This is me. Who is this? You don't know? Don't ask me who I am. I'm the man that's murdering women in Harlem and you, sweetheart Detective are a pitiful example of a detective. Knowing nothing about anything. You don't even know the words of that great woman. Who is this, and how'd you get this number? Oh, Imani. I've been a bad boy again. Okay, where are you? No, Imani. I told you. You have to find out for yourself. Oh, by the way, you can call me Alexander. Alexander, can you do me a favor? What is it? From now on, can you call me at the police station? I hate to work when I'm off duty. Oh, you think this is a game, huh? You will never find me. Sick. Another woman, chemical fumes that kills 'em. Same neighborhood. Seems like he's got a psychological, twisted, fixated, woman perversion. Can I quote you? Absolutely not. That's definitely off the record. Take some pictures and some notes too. Hello. You sick son of a bitch. I told you not to call this number... Hold on, hold on, hold on. This is not who you think it is. What? I said this is not who you think it is. This is Byron Thomas. I met you the other day with my sister. Oh, hello, Mr. Thomas. How are you? I'm fine. What can I do for you? You okay? Somebody piss you off? Occupational hazard. I understand. I can only imagine what your job is like. It will be beyond your imagination. Trust me. Listen. The reason I called you is to ask you out to lunch. Uh huh. Or a cup of coffee. Maybe breakfast, if lunch is too much, too soon. No, no, no, no. Lunch is not too much. Cool. Let's do it. How about today at one o'clock? Today? Yes. That would be too soon. Can't do it today, huh? No, but I can make it up to you. I promise. It's a good consolation. Detective Moses, take care of yourself. Be careful. Why did you do it, Mommy? Why do you kill all those people, Mommy, I'm going to tell daddy what you did, Mommy. I'm going to tell him. I won't. I won't tell him. I promise. Please stop! Stop hitting me! You're hurting me. Please, stop! Please stop hitting me! You going you're going to kill me. I hate you! Hate you! Let me tell you something. I should kill you for what you did to Daddy. Blaming him for your murders and have him convicted falsely for it. He's spending the rest of his life in prison because of you. I hate you, woman. You made me hate women. To wanna kill them. You made me this way! What can I tell you? You wanted publicity and now you got it. What do you want from me? I'm just trying to arrest you. But you gotta admit, you are one sick son of a bitch. We just gotta call it like we see it. I don't want to talk to you any longer. I want Detective Moses on the phone. One moment. He wants to speak to you. How are you, Band Aid? How dare you mentioned my mother!? I want a retraction. Why would you bring my mother into the picture? Change the story, or I will go out and kill 20 more. I didn't write the story, but you can tell me why you committed the murders and where I can pick you up to arrest you. I mean it, Detective! I'm not crazy! You are not the son of my mother. You will pay for this. You better change it, or I will be a bad boy again, and again, and again, and again. How dare you mention my mother? I wanna retraction. Why would you bring my mother into the picture? Change the story or I will go out and kill 20 more. I mean it, detective. I'm not crazy. You are not the son of my mother. You will pay for this. You better change it, or I will be a bad boy again, and again, and again, and again. You're a psychologist now, huh? No, Lieutenant. You sound like one. Fixated, twisted, Mother... Mother... What did you say? Mother perversion. You think you can solve the case? Yes. I spoke to the psychiatrist about this, and he said, you are probably right. Really? However, he said the suspect appears to be suffering as a paranoid victim of mother hate, and suggested I take you off the case. What? Why? It may help appease the killer. I can handle this. Moses, I want to catch him. Here you are, having conversations with him, quoting to the press, but we haven't arrested him. You know how that makes us look. This is a serial case. It's not a regular case, Lieutenant. Moses, you are off the case and keep your mouth shut. Bradley, you're in charge of the case for right now. Yes, sir. We have black women being murdered right here in Harlem. We're supposed to be an elite homicide squad made up of black officers. We had to fight for years to patrol our own neighborhood. There is not one white officer on this squad, so we can't use that as an excuse that the police don't care about black people. I want a press release, warning all women in the area to lock their doors and be aware of this man. Also, send officers from the civilian patrol to the homes in the area and have them warn the residents. Got it. We finally have a composite of him. Issue it. Can I help you? Yes, Miss. I'm here to give you advice on how to protect yourself from the serial killer. Have you heard about her? I heard it was a he. May I come inside to explain the precautions you can take? No. 9-1-1? I think I saw the killer. They took you off the case? Yeah. Good. Now you can get another job. They took me off of the case, Crystal. They didn't fire me. Unfortunate for you. What are you all happy about? When I told him, I couldn't meet up with him for lunch. He told me "Take care of yourself. Be careful." What's the big deal about that? He said it so smooth. He said, "Take care of yourself. Be careful." Okay, when am I gonna meet this guy? Soon. Real soon. Detective Moses? Yes, Band Aid. You calling to turn yourself in? I'm very unhappy to hear you're off the case, Detective. You better tell your superior to put you back on the case, or I will go out and kill many, many, many more. They say this witness isn't wrong. What? She can ID him. The composite worked. So where does the witness live? I don't know, but it's in the file. So when are you gonna get the file? Later, when I get back to the station. What are you getting at, Moses? Can you let him know what's in it when you get it? Come on, Moses. You off the case. Please, Bradley. Come on. I mean, you know how it is? It's the cop in me? You lucky you're my partner. For real. You lucky. Hello, Miss Gorgeous. What's that you drinking? Look like you need a refill. How you doing, man? Doing good. And you? Good. Rum and coke, please. Sure. All right. Welcome. So where's everyone tonight, man? Kind of empty in here. It's still early. Yeah, that's right. It's still early. How you doing Miss Gorgeous? I love that red on you. You need a refill. Right now, you need to stand up, before I cut your heart out and eat it like a steak and drink your blood like a liquor. I saw how you didn't want to be bothered, so I had to end it. What did you say to him? I told him if he didn't leave you alone, I would cut his throat and stab him in his heart at the same time. Nah, I'm kidding. I told him I had business with this beautiful woman, and I heard his wife was outside looking for him. You know him? For a long time. What's your name? Can I buy you a drink? Vincent. The name's Vincent, and no, I'm buying you a drink. What do you drink? Anything. Oh, you're certified drunk? Among other things, I am a working girl. You know what I mean? I'm beginning to get the picture. Two beers, please. Thanks for coming to my rescue. My pleasure. My pleasure. People never dress like you, are in this joint. What are you doing in here? Well, I don't like bars. I just had to come tonight. So glad I did. Well you know the line? What is a beautiful girl like you doing in a place like this. My pimp. You have a pimp? I told you, I'm a working girl. All right. You are a real professional. I'm sorry. Go ahead with what you are saying. My pimp is getting very uneasy with this crazy man going around killing women in the neighborhood. He's driving me crazy. He put three new locks on the door, window locks, you name it. I had to come out to get some air, and a couple of drinks to calm my nerves. Well you do just that. Drink and calm your nerves. You got a place around here? Not too far. Why? Do you know what I'm going to do? What's that? I am going to invite you some on the house. Why are you going to do that? For protecting me. For being nice to me. Come on. You know a February Brown? You know a cop? You probably got violations all up the wall. Should I bring 'em down? All right, I know her. So what? You seen her tonight? Yeah. She just left. By herself? Nah. Some dude. Seemed like a trick to me. Let's go. Bradley, stay outside the door. I really hope you could get back on the case. Me too. Okay, Moses. Apologies are in order. I'm sorry, I was wrong. The psychiatrist as well. No problem, Lieutenant. Good. I want a press release stating that Detective Moses is back in charge of the case. Okay, great. Thank you, Lieutenant. Remember, to keep your mouth shut. No more quotes. I am very happy to hear your back on the case, Detective Moses. Well, I made it clear you insisted, Bandaid. Why don't you make it easy for everybody else and just give yourself up. No, I cannot make it that simple for you, Detective. You must earn your pay. Concern for the taxpayer, huh? Shouldn't I be? Well, why don't you fully elaborate on your point. No, Detective. The more I talk, the better chance you have to trace me. Nice try. I will be good for now. No more murders. Damn it! I just needed two more minutes. ♪ So maybe I don't have to look no more ♪ 'Cause I found what I'm looking for ♪ So baby you're drips worth it ♪ I just wanna fill my cup, and drink some more ♪ You're so beautiful ♪ You're so beautiful ♪ You are... ♪ You are so beautiful ♪ You're so beautiful ♪ I will ride for you ♪ You never have to question my loyalty ♪ We are on the same frequency ♪ You know the right ♪ I will always be right there for you ♪ You can always count on me ♪ So maybe I don't have to look no... Two witnesses! One now, lieutenant. One witness. Numerous telephone conversations and we're acting as a public relations management group for this nut? I got detectives, and I got five dead citizens, but no murderer. Moses? Bradley? We have an idea. I mean, as stated, there are five victims. Why don't we release a statement stating there's six? This way... I know it'll stir him up. He'll more than likely call very upset, and we'll have a better chance of keeping him on the phone even longer. Thus a better chance to trace. Does that sound good? At this point, anything sounds good. Let's do it. Hello? I did not commit that murder. Hi, Band Aid. Where are you? I did not do it. You hear me? Do what? Don't patronize me. Victim number six, I'm not responsible for. Anything you say, Band Aid. It was a copycat. You must tell the press it was a copycat. You can call Austin yourself. I mean, we have evidence this time. What kind of evidence? It doesn't matter. We got you now. I'm hanging up. Don't you dare. Don't you hang up on me. I will murder 20 more. All right. All right, already. Don't you think you've done enough? Listen, we know you're 5'8, with red and black streaks in your hair. That's an imposter! My hair is black. Sure, Band Aid. We got a full description on you. Okay? I told you, I would stop. Okay, Band Aid. All right, gimme some time so I can correct this. Adam's office building on 125th. You're funny, Byron. I hope that means it's nice meeting you? That it does. May I use your restroom? Of course. It's right over there on the left. Thank you. So what do you think? He's good looking. He's smart. He's funny. Yeah. I'm glad. And don't worry, I'm gonna take my time. I'll sure be glad when you catch this killer. I don't like you being so close to him. He may get you. They're trying to get me every day. Well, I guess I better be going. It was really nice meeting you, Crystal. It was nice meeting you too, Byron. Take care of my sister now. No question. So you gonna call me, or I'm gonna call you? You better call me and let me know how you doing out there. I mean, every few hours. You don't have time for that. I mean with your new apartment and your clients. Don't worry, I'll be good. I said, every few hours. Who is it? I have a flower delivery for Mr. Thomas. Who's it from? Imani Moses. Imani. Mr. Thomas. This particular plant needs a certain amount of water every two weeks. It's our company policy to show you that amount, and Miss Moses signed up for the confirmation. Some customers come back and complain after two weeks that the plant is dying. Mostly it's because of water. Do you mind if I show you? Sure. Come on in. All right. I need a glass full of water. Okay. All right. You see what I did there? Around the edges only, and three quarters of the contents of the glass, every two weeks. Got it. Would you sign this here, please. ♪ You don't even want it with me ♪ You don't need to want it with me ♪ You don't even want it with me ♪ You don't even want it with me What's up, sis? Imani! That nut called the house. The killer? Yes. Where are you? Where? Did you leave the house? Yes, I'm on the street. Good, good. Don't go home until we can go together. He left a number for you to call. It's 212 1234. Oh, my god. That's Byron. I gotta go. Don't go home. Okay. We gotta go. It's my boyfriend. We gotta go. Don't look. Don't look. He's dead, Imani. No! I saw a guy down the block just looking at the building. When he spotted me looking, he took off running around the block. I went after him, but by the time I got to the corner he was gone. Where's Moses and Bradley? Outside. He knows the area. Let's get back to the station. How may I help you? My name is Detective Bradley and this here is Detective Moses. We're in pursuit of a murder suspect in this area. Have you seen or heard anything unusual? No. Can't say that I have. May I ask your name? Bob McDonald. Mr. McDonald, I have to ask a few routine questions. Okay? Do you live alone? Yes. Do you work? Yes. Where do you work? Solutions Insurance. Is that a picture of your wife? My mother. Beautiful woman. Thanks. Look, I have an early appointment tomorrow, detective, so if you don't mind. Thanks for your cooperation. Happy, mommy? Now you have the police right in your living room. Is that close enough, Mother? Do you think you can stop now? The threat of jail. Would that make you stop? Did you see how upset he got when you mentioned the picture of his mother? That and the fact that the company that he works for is in the same building we traced yesterday. You know what? Stay here. I'm gonna go, just in case we need some backup. I wanna ask him some more questions. I want my daddy back. You took that from me. You took my father from me. You evil woman. I'm gonna kill you one day. One day I'ma get the courage, and I'ma kill you. And I want my daddy. I know what mommy did to you, Daddy. But don't you worry, the police are right in the living room. You think that'll make her stop? Stop the killing? Ha, ha. Hi. Hi. Hi. Band Aid. You wanna tell me about the victims? What in the world are you talking about? The different costumes, the telephone conversations. The Band Aids on the forehead. Victims choking on lethal chemicals. What did your mother do to make you so sick? Detective, you must be under some heavy stress. Now I'm gonna ask you leave. I want to see the closet. I wanna see the chemicals. I want to... Detective Moses, you know you need a warrant for that. You have no idea who you messing with. I will have your job. Now leave, now, before I call the police on you. Okay, but I'll be back. He did it, Bradley. He killed them all, and he killed Byron. Let's get that search warrant. To hell with a search warrant, and to hell with backup. Let's get this motherfucker. Cover me, I'm going in. I got you. Moses! Moses! Down the hall to the staircase. Go! I'll be okay. Go! Good job, everybody. I'm certain Harlem appreciates you. Sorry for your loss, Moses. If you need time off, it will be no problem. I'm good. Thank you. Bradley, Moses, are you sure you don't wanna go to the hospital for a physical and stress evaluation? I'm fine. Me too. Okay. We got a murderer off the streets and we have to be ready to catch the next one. I got a call about a murder on a 116th Street. Stabbing? Shooting? What? Murder is the crime.
