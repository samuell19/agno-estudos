(SNIFFLES) Ryan. He wa-- he wasn't always such an asshole. I just wish everybody else could've known that. (SNIFFLES) W-- wait. (GASPS) (DRAMATIC MUSIC PLAYING) (GROWLS) (GASPS) What in the uppercase fuck was that? STEVEN: How did he survive that? (SHRIEKING IN DISTANCE) (ALL GASP) If that doesn't convince you, I don't know what will. (PANTS) If he just turns like that... There was a whole bus full of kids. This is happening. (SOBS) Is Danny gonna be okay? Are any of us? (PANTS) I don't know. I don't know. I don't know, but I promise you I will do everything I can to make sure that we are. Okay? Okay? I won't let anything happen to you, Tamra. Okay? Um... We can't go out there. It's not safe. So we barricade the doors and let's just stay in here. Come on. No. Then we'll just trap ourselves. Guys, we have no food, no water. We need help, and I think there is help out there. There has to be. What, but you just-- you just want to stay here and do nothing? Whoa. Calm-- calm down, Ever. I'm just trying to protect us. Yeah. That's all, I'm sure. Well, what do you suggest we do, then? Those things, I say we draw them to one side of the building and then slip through the other. Go get your phones. Maybe the bus starts. No, no, absolutely not. Absolutely fucking not. It's dangerous. Guys, c-- come on, help me with the door. Wait, who put you in charge, exactly? Ever. What? I am sick of no one listening to common fucking sense. Absolutely not! I forbid it! No! (TENSE MUSIC PLAYING) You know what? The great thing about this plan is that I don't need your permission, Randall. If you fuck this up, we can all die. We have listened to you this whole day. You've somehow always had the answers, so everyone went along with it. But how's that working out for us? Danny was right. What we need is fire. (GRUNTS) (SIGHS) (SUSPENSEFUL MUSIC PLAYING) Wayne was good for one thing. (YELLS) Oh, fuck! (SCOFFS) There is no back way out. EVER: I'll make one. TAMRA: Ever!

(VOICE FADES) (TENSE MUSIC PLAYING) Good job, Steven. Good job. You had to. COACH: (SHOUTING) That's no hustle! That's a nap! RANDALL: I'm not talking about changing the whole world. I'm talking about changing a few people for the better. You know who? People who make our lives a living hell. What if we gave it back in a way that actually made a difference? What kind of difference? Remember the Scared Straight program? Convicts and drill sergeants yelling at kids, showing them prison life, awful shit, you know, until they cry and promise they won't grow up to be assholes? Yeah, but Danny, Hunt and all those guys are popular. They're not considered at risk, dude. We are. Exactly. Nothing ever happens to them. We can fix that. They'll be our perfect audience. We'll look like heroes for a day. We'll save the day. The assholes will respect us for once. Scared Straight. Scared Straight. STEVEN: Randall, this is the biggest place ever. How are we gonna wrangle all this? RANDALL: Exactly. That's why we have a ringer, Chip Landsness. Chip Landsness? Isn't that guy a dealer? We'll get to that. (GROANS) Holy shit, Chip. Holy fucking shit. I said subdue, Mr. Lorenzo, not bite his fucking face off. CHIP: It looks worse than it is. He's fucking dead! What are you, a doctor now? Fucking look, Chip! Does he look alive to you? What the hell, man? CHIP: How do you know? (PANTS) CHIP: Hey. They needed to believe it, and I delivered, okay? Full commitment. I'm fucking method, dude. Did he deserve it? Fucking A, he did. Fucking A. (DRAMATIC MUSIC PLAYING) CHAD: He looks familiar... doesn't he? STEVEN: Okay, I get everything else, but what are we doing here? What's this part of the plan? Well, zombies can only do so much. They scare them inside, we scare them up here. STEVEN: So, what should I put on mine? RANDALL: How do they see you? STEVEN: Okay, wait. But we're still counting on tricking the bus driver. WAYNE: There's no need to trick the bus driver. Chad Lorenzo has been shitting on me since I was a freshman. He got me there. I loved being a high school bully so much, I never left. Became a teacher. I'm all the way in. CHIP: Jesus, Wayne, hitting a little hard, bud. You gonna be able to function? Function? Chip, I've been waiting 20 years for this, 20 years to unleash. I'm putting the "fun" back in "function." CHIP: Oh, he will be humbled. Believe me. Ever, I read somewhere that 99 percent of all teens wouldn't be bullied if they simply believed they didn't deserve it. Do you deserve it? (SHOUTING, SCREAMING) RANDALL: We let Chip do his thing, and they all start running, and we lead them to here, and we wait for the zombies. CHIP: Which will be your drugged-out Rando classmates, herded by Wayne and yours truly, because... Check this out. What's in that stuff? CHIP: Control. This is your Manson Family desert drug. You tell 'em to dance, they will dance. You tell 'em to follow, they will follow. Where did it come from? Burning Van. Burning Man? CHIP: No. That shit's for hippies. Burning Van. Happens in Pensacola about once a month. You can get all kinds of shit there. Had my guy mixology this special cocktail for us. This is your zombie juice. See, we got it all planned out, Stevie. STEVEN: Okay, sure, that's the plan, but what's the plan after the plan? RANDALL: The plan after the plan is exactly what they testify. We just say what they say they saw. We get attacked by someone who doesn't exist. We all heard the tape that's been burned in some barrel. And we say exactly what they say they saw. STEVEN: Except, what if somebody catches on? RANDALL: If we keep 'em confused and scared, then they won't figure it out. How much did you fucking inject them with, Chip? That shit back there, that was fucking crazy! I didn't know it was gonna be like that! I thought it was just gonna be, like, shuffling Night of the Living Dead zombies. That shit back there was like-- was like World War Z on fucking bath salts, man! CHIP: It's an imperfect science, Steven. Chip, you said that they wouldn't feel anything. You said that they wouldn't get hurt. You said-- CHIP: Look, dude, do I need-- I need to explain drugs to you? It will wear off. They won't remember a thing. They will wake up and not feel a thing. STEVEN: They're not gonna forget, 'cause they know, Chip. They know. They know. They all know. I heard them. (SNARLS) (SCREAMS) Help us. (SCREAMS) What do you even know about anything? You don't even know what the fuck you put in those things! We had a plan, man. Focus on the positive. Everyone bought it. We did our job. I mean, so what if there are a few hiccups? I-- Hiccups? Wayne almost got everybody killed, including me. And now he's dead. No one was supposed to die, man! It's a mulligan. We did our job. (HOWLS) (ROCK MUSIC PLAYING) Whoo! CHIP: I don't know what you guys are shitting your pants about. You knew this would be a possibility. Why else would you have a bag full of real weapons? I got you your prize, assholes. They're all in the cage. Now go do what you gotta do. What are you fucking talk... What are you talking? What cage? What weapons? What-- what? CHIP: Come on, Stevie. You really think plans like this don't have backup plans? STEVEN: What the fuck is that for? CHIP: This is the contingency plan. This negates any and all human error, of which there's been a real fucking lot of! You two, uh... you gave me hope. I saw a chance to take back all the years that were stolen from me because of the-- the judgment they put upon me, because of the labels they gave me, because of the resentment inside of me. All that shit that happens in high school, that doesn't stay in high school. That shit gets branded in here, and it festers in here. I still carry all that fucking anger, all that sadness, all that-- that worry and anxiety. I'm so fucking mad! It's different faces but the same fucking dudes. The same fucking teachers, the same fucking cops. Now, I hoped that we could cure something tonight. I really did. We just exposed it for what it is. A fucking plague. Now, I'm going to do what I can to clean it up. Maybe that'll help with some of the years of misery. I don't fucking know. (CHUCKLES) But that could kill them. If it need be, Stevie. And that need... be. RANDALL: All right, Tamra's gonna wonder where I went. I gotta get back. (SIGHS) It's a shame I was only able to save you, Steven. What are you talking about? What the-- wh-- what are you saying? Anyone who's onto us has to go, for real, or we go to prison forever. I ain't going back. You were in fucking jail? Only twice. Chill. I rehabilitated. STEVEN: Oh, my God, we're so... fucked! Fuck! Oh, no, no. Hey, hey. (SOBS) We just rewrite the ending. We work with the girls. We kill the assholes. If anything happens, anything goes down, they are just as guilty as us. Okay? Win-win. I'm sorry. Ever was just too smart for her own good. Maybe Jacey's more your speed. Come on. (WHIMPERS) (OMINOUS MUSIC PLAYING) Hey. There's no turning back now, Stevie. (WHIMPERS) CHAD: That man is going to murder you tonight, Ever, unless you do something to stop him. (SUSPENSEFUL MUSIC PLAYING) (EERIE MUSIC PLAYING) RANDALL: I wanted to be the hero. Guess I was always destined to be the villain. What now? What now? What's the plan? This is the grand finale, Steven. But we won't lose.

(SOFT MUSIC PLAYING) (BIRDS CHIRPING) EVER: And so, the PTA set up a field trip for extra credit with the goal of teaching teens to become one with nature, respect each other... My life sucks. EVER: ...and maybe, just maybe, plant the seeds of friendship. But instead, two boys, desperate to be lords of high school and two adults who never grew up past it hatched a plan involving reckless driving, drinking, drugs, violence and horror to teach a teacher a lesson, bully the bullies into submission, humble those with hubris, and have unprotected apocalypse sex with their crushes. This plan was an epic fail. However, as the sun rose, something else about that night dawned upon us, an unintended side effect of what we'd all been through. A bully had become a protector. Who would've thought that we'd be friends again, huh, Danny? (CHUCKLES) It's Daniel. EVER: The estranged had come back together. If I may ask, what happened between you two? It's a long story. No, man, it's not. We were best friends at fat camp. Yeah, and then I lost all the weight, but I became a bit of a dick until this morning, so... (CHUCKLES) Guess it's a short story. Onward. (CHUCKLES) More like a sonnet. EVER: A beauty queen realized the inside is just as important as the outside. Strangers were no longer strangers. Not to be rude, but... who are you? I got on the wrong bus. Thanks. EVER: And there it was. This unlikely group had bonded, like braces, during the most combustible, formative years of teen life to become a loyal tribe. Matt, Juniper... Candace, Wagoner. I hear Karlak can help us get the bus started. How can I help? Who says we want your help, Jump Street? I'm kidding. Let's go, Hunter. It is amazing how much you can learn about somebody after you've been held captive together. Ain't that right, Fat Camp? DANNY: I guess so, Jump Street. EVER: And then, there were the two old friends. And... then there's us. (CHUCKLES) What did we learn, you and I? You first. Um, I-- I guess this is all about getting out of your own way. (TAMRA CHUCKLES) I got stuck. Sorry. Well, I mean... I was seriously close to killing you back there, so... sorry. Yeah. What was up with that? You know, in the moment, I... Uh-huh. ...didn't recognize you. But then... I saw my friend. But she wasn't the same anymore. Is it that bad? Uh, more like badass. What? Yeah. Really? Yes. You think so? (BOTH CHUCKLE) It's totally you. I mean, don't get me wrong, that was crazy back there. Like, you got a total mayhem makeover. But... yeah, all of a sudden, there you were, standing there, like... complete. And that was the scariest part of the whole night. 'Cause I thought... "She doesn't need me anymore." (SOFT MUSIC PLAYING) No one said high school was easy. (BOTH CHUCKLE) You know, my mom said it's when you get out of high school that you learn who you really are. That's when you figure out where you belong. But maybe... this completely fucked-up night... proved that we don't have to wonder which groups are gonna accept us or define us, because any group would be fucking lucky to have us consider them.
