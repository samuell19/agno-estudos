Hello Father. What are you doing here? Everyone has to choose according to their conscience. Those are your words. I don't need you, Lena. We can manage on our own. Mama. I will always fight with you, and for you. Ferdinand is here. You have leave? To the ladies. You're the backbone of our society. Women, children, the old Poles, Jews, Russians. We shot them... - Stop stop stop! Desertion is punishable by death. I have to report you. You would have me sentenced to death? No. I loved my brother and I am innocent. In everlasting closeness, your Heinrich. Helga! How will we manage? Just prisoners of war and foreign workers. You can't do that, not Mikolai. Frenchmen must be protected. Must be reported to the Red Cross. East Prussia will be held to the last man. Anyone who leaves, will be sentenced to death. I demand absolute loyalty. I'm not a farmhand. We won't go until everyone has a wagon place. Can I rely on you? For your people and for mine. With 20 prisoners of war you risk everyone's life. I gave him my word and I'll keep it. Out of the question, no. We all dead. What can't you understand about that, huh? We'll go by ourselves, right now. Lena, Viki is gone. Viki. I'm going to ride out now on my own to look for Vicky. You have to lead the trek. Only you can, Lena. You alone are responsible now. But I can't do it. You can Lena, you are strong. Now go, my child. It's up to the women now. We're moving. The Flight Part 2 Frau Meister, at the next crossroads we turn off to the north-east, yes. Lena, we can't go on. We should find somewhere for the night. I know. East Prussia January 1945 We'll start out at two in the morning. It will help us to get through. And tomorrow we'll be at Lahnstein Estate. That's a detour for us, Francois. - No, it's not a detour Louis. It's right for child. Everyone is free, Louis to go his own way. We'll go to Lahnstein together and drop off the girl. Objections? Then that's what we'll do. With all my strength I tried to live up to my role. For my people, it was to provide the best possible care. For the suffering of others you turned a blind eye. Seen the farmer? Schaller family head? Vicky had already been missing for five days. There are over 90 people here already. In the barn, the house. I don't know where to put one more. - At least a place to stable the horses. Where can we sleep? Anywhere for the children would be fine. I have no room. Martha Schaller? Frau Schaller. Good to see you. Countess, is that you? It's really you. What an honour, what a pleasure. Come on Waltraud, don't sit around. Hop to it. I won't put up with this treatment for us, my baby. Sleep, I saw a little improvement today. Tomorrow everything will be fine. I made a place for you in the little room. That's not necessary, really. You can't sleep in the barn, Countess. No no, I insist. Thank you. I could only find this. Martha, you need it yourself. We have enough, really. Mikolai. Mikolai. Your turn. I sent my guardian angel to Mama. So she finds me. I'll take you tomorrow, to Lahnstein Estate, to your mama. And now, get a good night's sleep. LAHNSTEIN ESTATE I've heard the road is reserved. Only for the military. We have to go north. Johannes, has Lena finally arrived? - No. But cousin Erich from Allenstein got here. The Russians are coming from the north, and now from the south too. I think they are only delayed because of the crossings over the Nogat and Vistula. That's why. - We will wait for Lena while Sophie is so sick. I think I'd better welcome Erich. Lena, there is Lahnstein. Instead of there, we just keep making detours down here? It's just not on. Did you really think we would find them here? 20 prisoners of war and a little girl. Who will willingly take in prisoners of war when even regular people can't find a place. Lenchen, Francois has probably gone by back roads. ZZZ, zzzzz. She'll wear herself out searching every night for the kid. Did you tell her, Babettchen? We can manage without men. It's not easy, but we can. Grandma Herta, that's not what this is all about right now. Where will Fritz be now? And Georg? If they don't actually find me at Mahlenberg where will they then look for me? Georg would never leave his home. You understand? Never. What am I talking about? You can't understand me. I'll go with Jean to his home. And also to the countryside. 'My little country girl' he always says. Search the hut. Viki. Viki, quickly. Hide yourself. Don't shoot, don't shoot. No problem. No problem. Out, come on. Quickly Come on come on, out. Come on, quickly. Hop hop, come on Hop hop. What's it look like? - Cleaned out. Papers. Francois? That is Alexei. He realises the need to run as Russians are being killed. You need to horseshoe otherwise you won't go. He means Countess, your horse needs to be fitted with new studs. That would be a great help. If he wants, he can come with us. If he rides Hector or Linda that would make life easier. In other words... - I understand, I understand. Halt. Go. Go. For something like this the Lord has given us discretion. Go quickly. Mikolai! Get down! Get down, get down! Mikolai? Mikolai? Sophie. Ruediger. You're responsible for 150 people. I'm not going without you. Nevertheless, you have to. I want you to. I'll come later with Lena. We'll meet up at Lilienfeld or Kleist. It's the first since since Ferdinand's death you have spoken to me. We're moving. I'm hungry. Wonderful! Here. Morphine, liquid gold. Are you coming with us? My place is here. Good morning. Good morning. You didn't wake me up. I would have, but Babette forbade it Countess, we have the farmer. The old chap persuaded her to come with us. Good, but not too much baggage. When we get to Lahnstein, everything will be better. For me when we get to Lahnstein, things can't get any better. Alexei, Helene you have to help me. We'll roll the car aside. Grandma, don't tell Lena right away. And in spring, in spring everyone will return here. And then you will say how pointless and crazy this all was. But child. - How will my Georg find me, and Fritzchen if everyone's simply gone. She can't do that. Not that, she can't do that. She's right. She really is right. We're not making any progress. And if the Russians come? With the fighting over the Russians are just people. Tonight we'll be in Lanstein. It's not far. I am a traitor stinker. Now then, Grandma Herta? You're so cold. What are you doing about it? I told you to move about? Why doesn't anyone listen to me, hmm? Oh Lena. Where's Babette then? Hmm. Where is Babette? Uncle Johannes. Magdalena. Good to see you. At last. My treasure. Oh, my treasure. Lena. Sophie. I want to return to Mahlenberg Frau Meister, where at least I have my own bed. I'm stopping here, can't do any more. And you can't either. The Baron's come up with a special treat today, from a secret reserve. Thank you, Francois. Thank you. Where are your men? Have they all eaten? Why won't he speak? Did he say anything to you? No, nothing. I'm sure Babette will only have got as far as the farm. I'll be back when Viki wakes up. Thank you. The potatoes will last half the winter, Babette. That my Georg knew, Frau Meister. That I'm here on a stranger's farm. She wanted me to leave Mahlenberg. - I'll get some more wood. I did not want to leave. Only because that child left with the men did I leave at all. Frau Meister? Babette, Babette. Lena, come away. Babette, I'll find Frau Meister and Babette. You stay here. You wait and you will be able to slip away. Understood? Babette. Babette. Where's Frau Meister? What are you doing here? Looking after Viktoria. I don't want her to run away again. Yes then, then get into bed. Are Francois and Mama already here? It still ongoing, Viki. All in good time, they'll be here. Come on Babette, come on! Lena, wait! Come on, this way! I know where we are! I know the schloss! Come on! This way! I'm alright again. I'm alright. We have to go. We have to save ourselves. Babette. Thank you for coming. I'm here because your daughter asked me. How come you didn't wait for me at Mahlenberg? We had an agreement. You and your father broke your word. But for you aristocrats that doesn't matter. I told Viki, that Mikolai and the others continued on their way. What about the others? Dead. Dead, all of them. Jean, Louis, Vladimir, Dimitri, Igor dead. They wanted me to go on. I forced them to wait. I didn't abandon you. I could do nothing. Nothing. He died next to me. Like my brother. Mikolai. A child. All civilians must be moved to the cellar and barn. That's not possible. We have women, children and sick here. Besides, do you know what time it is? I have 2,500 men to take care of. 0520 hours Madame. We're only doing our duty. Duty? Your stupidity just infuriates us. An entire population is on the run, because they were not evacuated. The civilian and military infrastructure is currently disintegrating. Actually, that's because you all ignore the facts and from a victorious army only a pack of rude men are left because all the good ones have long since died. I expect you to keep your own house in order. And you and your men go in the barn. Heinrich. Mother. It's good that you're here. Please make sure that the gentlemen know how to behave properly. Babette? Babette? Babette, please don't give up do you hear? As soon as I told father about my pregnancy he said that I was no longer his daughter. Do you remember that? I am, I am driving my cows too far into the river, ever deeper. Suddenly you were there pulled me from my horse, and screamed at me. You said, I had to live. Do you hear? You said there's a reason for everything. You don't have to understand but you do have to live. Babette, I need you. Stay with me. You can take the soup to the library. And two men for the plates. because I'm not helping you. I have a new movement order from Oberst Metzger. I'm allowed to join you. You take care of everything here just by yourself. So much, too much. Why won't you look at me? Since Ferdinand's death you won't talk to me. So it would appear, I'm to blame. I am blameless, you know that. At least that's the feeling I get. All the time. I was better at school. I was, successful at university. I was successful. It made me. And you enjoyed time with your two darlings Constantin and Ferdinand. You don't you see me. Why don't you see me? We'll go out and retrieve her. Yes get Lena, go. Uncle Heinrich! Take me with you. Viki, that's not possible. It's not a piece of cake. He will find your mama. Yes. And Francois and Babette, promise? Promise. Perhaps everything at Mahlenberg looks the same. Your father saw it coming long before. He wanted you to get going even before Christmas. I didn't think it was possible. I never imagined that. We would lose everything. I was just ahead of the Russians at Lahnstein. Nothing will happen to Viki. Because of the snowstorm the Russians also can't move. We'll be there a bit before them. I'll just have a look at Babette. Is nobody sleeping any more tonight? Quickly, get to bed! We're riding back. We must have missed her party. Lena! Lena, Lena. Everything alright? Thank you, Francois. I'm grateful you helped me. Thank you, I'm alright. Heinrich. What about Hector? Francois, tomorrow we have to look for Mikolai. You have to promise me. We won't find him, Viki. What do you mean? Where is he? Why won't you tell me? Is he dead? Yes Viki, he's dead. No. The Germans shot him. How can you do that? How can you talk like that to a child? Telling the truth? Should I continue telling her a lie? Lena should I have done that? What does your truth provide, except self pity. Your truth. Wo ich gehe wo ich stehe bist du lieber Gott bei mir. Wenn ich in auch niemals sehe weiss ich sicher, Gott ist hier. Amen. Dear God, thank you for bringing my mama back to me. And forgive me for not watching over Mikolai. Although you really might have watched over him too. And at least he is not afraid any more. Not of Germans, not of Russians. Give it to him regularly, every two hours. And he has to drink a lot. If he won't, lastly you use a spoon. The Russians have taken Osterode, Deutsch Eylau, Allenstein Mohrungen and Preussisch Holland. All roads to the west are cut off. So we'll have to cross the lagoon. Is the farewell for ever? Give me a second chance, Lena. The Red Army had boxed us in. East Prussia was cut off from the Reich. The only route to go was over the frozen Baltic, the lagoon. A route also used by the retreating Wehrmacht. This made it twice as dangerous for us. Completely exhausted, without protection and on brittle ice we had to continue our way to the west. Await your turn. Then it's vital you follow the markers. Not left, not right and always keep moving. You think the ice isn't the same everywhere? It's the only route. 30 kilometres. Left or right, death lies in wait. Heil Hitler. Heil Hitler. You can't take everything, good lady. Our stuff stays on and get your hands off my wagon. What's going on here? He's making us leave everything. He wants to take it for himself. Herr Major, I'm an honourable man. The wagon is to be unloaded. Traudchen. Fritz, Fritz. Babette's Fritzchen! Wait here. Babette, Babette your son. Fritz? Estate Manager Georg's son? Yes Count, at your service Count. It's only for your own safety. The wagon must be unloaded to enable distribution of the load. And everything must be got off. Some of the wagons are too heavy. I don't care what you do or don't want. Fritz is my grandson and he remains my grandson. And God wanted me to find him here and now I'm taking him with me before the Russians get him. - Your grandson is assigned to me by the Partei as an assistant. - The Partei, the Partei the devil take your Partei. Your Partei already has sold you down the river. The boy is under age. He belongs with his Volkssturm unit. And since it no longer exists he belongs to his family, their authority. Continue being obstructive and I will report you. Mama doesn't want to get down. She doesn't understand weight must distributed. Helene, Helene we... He's asleep. Does he feel better? He'll get well again. But now he's asleep. No. Vater unser, der Du bist im Himmel. Geheiliget werde Dein Name. Dein Reich komme. Dein Wille geschehe wie im Himmel, also auch auf Erden. Unser t?glich Brot gib uns heute. Und vergib uns unsere Schuld als wir vergeben unsern Schuldigern. Und f?hre uns nicht in Versuchung. Sondern erl?se uns von dem ?bel. Denn Dein ist das Reich und die Kraft und die Herrlichkeit in Ewigkeit. Amen. We'll get through this. Together. With God's help. It's a girl. Aircraft coming! Quick, get down! Viki, Viki Sophie come on quickly. Quickly. Viki, come on quickly. Under the wagon. Under the wagon, Lena! Under! Stay under the wagon, Viki. Mama Mama! Where are you? Mama! Viki! Mama, Mama! Mama! Mama! Francois. Francois! No, no. Vielleicht muss das alles sein. Vielleicht ist es richtig. Wenn Menschen zaehlen fur nicht. Fur leben versterben. The relevant pain. This will help it. What's the matter with you? You've just given me. You've just given everyone. Hope. Now now help me lay the man down. Not now, later. Why do you run away from me? I don't fit in your world. You're in danger. I'm afraid. You have to leave. You really do. You have to leave. Everyone heard her on the ice shouting your name. You are in danger. You are both in danger. The next day we moved on. After four months of flight which brought indescribable suffering, and deprivation. We finally came, without any possessions across Thuringia to Bavaria. But here too no one wanted us permanently. We do not want any strangers here. This war was never ending. Bavaria April 1945 Lena. Well, what do you say? We're mobile again. Nice. I'll check it over properly. Milk. I had to pay for the milk with the coal. - That stolen by Fritz? Alexei and I, have got something else. - Potatoes and apples. Wonderful, give me. - I think anyone with too much should share it out. That's called food theft, Babette. Now come on, or dinner won't be on the table in good time. It's all right. We want to go to Regensburg. We belong to Landesschuetzen Battailon 413. But we lost them. They all disappeared and left us in the lurch. Anyway If your are not not deserters. And don't stink like Gandhi's flip flop. It will be alright. Are you hungry? Yes. - Yes. There will be enough for you three. Come along. Got you. - Got you. All the best. Countess. Thanks a lot. Herr Oberstabsrichter. - Major Gernstorff. In there are three soldiers, without a unit. Lenchen. Would you not have done better bringing something to eat. Where do you come from? And which unit? Landesschuetzen Battailon 413. We're looking for our unit, Oberleutnant - Do you have movement orders? No, Oberleutnant. Papers? Who are those three? They bumped into us earlier. What are they doing there? - Take their weapons. Schmidt, Kuhler! These three men have been temporarily arrested. Climb aboard. Do they still have to check them now when the war is over? Sophie, they can't just do that. They're taking those boys. It's clear it's their first time. Please determine what they have to say. Every schlosss, farm, council building in Dingolfing and Erding even the private houses. Everything is utterly crowded, utterly. Nobody wants us homeless wanderers. No one will take us in voluntarily. We don't need a bed from anyone. Nor strangers' lice. We have our own. In the village, everyone talks of surrender. That news is welcome. All that suffering to surrender in the end. We'll get the traitorous back stabbers. - Knock off all this nonsense, Fritz. We need peace, you hear? Peace! Thank you. Wilhelm is having nightmares again. Heinrich, when we see your father again, then... I want you to know how important you are to me. You are protecting us. You have given us security. But it will be... Lena, I don't think now is the right time to talk wisely about this. Will there ever be one? You don't have to love me as I love you, Lena. These loveless marriages. They make you unhappy. Because it's never really, a match. But we, we made a match. Herr Major, Herr Major. It's time for them. Heinrich. Stay here, it's all over. Sleep in a bit Mother. I'll be back soon. Gentlemen, I ask you now for your verdict. Guilty. Guilty. Guilty. Fire. From the Fuehrer's Headquarters it is reported that our Fuehrer, Adolf Hitler this afternoon, fighting to his last breath died for Deutschland. Hitler committed suicide. The Russians occupied Berlin and the Americans took Munich. On 8 May, at last peace. As uncertain as our future was I knew for sure there was nothing left of the world that we had come from. And that I wasn't the same any more. We have Prussians pouring in. It's enough for me, it's enough. I'm looking for my husband. Everyone is looking for someone, right now. But what would he be doing with us? Are you perhaps... My name is Gernstorff. Countess, excellency. The Count is not here he's in Munich, but come in. Come in, right. You made it, Max. Come in, undress. I always wanted, a life where everyone has the same chances. My Fritz too. So it must be, Socialism without the National. That's all I ask. Communists believe that too. But Mother, you hate the Russians. Yes, but I also hate the Germans who in Alexei's village, drove women and children into a church and... Mother, that's enemy propaganda. Are there only rotters and traitors here? Fritz. You give us your rubbish. All lies, all blame, huh? He made us great. The Fuehrer made Deutschland great. He did not obliterate you for nothing. Fritz it takes time, to get over the pain. Have you filled the emptiness with tripe? You Mother, you betrayed him too. You weren't worthy of the Fuehrer. Sophie. I look ridiculous. In Munich, it's not easy to find regular work and accommodation. I'm not used to begging. Sophie, is that not a bit over the top? Barbara can do that. Or our dear Resi. Not Barbara, Babette. - Yes correct, Babette. I'd like a cup of black tea. I'll do that. This putting on airs by the Count. Am I supposed to put up with it like you do. Sophie just told us. That they were shot. Three poor soldiers you had shot, why? Why, what did it change Heinrich? Lena I have never, never gone beyond the specified legal process, never. You just used that to absolve this regime of guilt. You'll never understand. Lena, understand the regime. We are very small cogs. We couldn't stop it. What should I have done? You're one of them. You're no better. Lena, you expect too much of me. The hero, you want me to be. That's not me. When I'm a judge someday preferably at the Supreme Court then you'll understand me! Ruediger? Come to bed now. I wanted all my children to be like you. That they would not always do what others, or myself expected of them. I have always done what my family expected. You lie to me. You always took a stand. If I had actually taken a stand, then I would not have sent away the man I was afraid to love. I've always avoided it. Convention, compromise. As your father told us. 'The circle of guilt'. Makes me think. Sophie, she understood me. Despite that however she's been with me for quite a long time. Don't you think? You have always been for me, my dear little daughter-in-law. Even as a child. Hello? Hello. You can tell by the pain that you no longer have something. I looked for you in the schloss, near Regensburg but you weren't there. And then the Americans helped. If I'd known that... I'm now working for the Allied Control Council. And I will help distinguish the guilty from the innocent. I don't want to lose you again. Thank you, for everything. Good luck. Come on. Come on now Wilhelm. Come on Viki now. Francois. Thank you. Merci beaucoup. It belonged to my mother. I'll wait for you. I'll certainly come. As soon as I have accommodation for all my people I'll come with Viki and Wilhelm. Subtitle and translation KWC19 2020
