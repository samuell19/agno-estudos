(eerie music) - Steve. Steve. Steve. Steve. (laughing) It's about time you woke up, guy. Oh, Steve. - Dude was thinking of that pussy. - Hey, she's all yours for the right price, Steve-o. - [Man] I haven't seen her here before. - [Man] She's new in town Skiddo. - [Skiddo] And how do you know? - She told me. Personally. - What was she like? - Find out for yourself, Sweet. If you got any balls. Hey what's with that boy? - Ah, it's that time of the month. Hey, Wolf, how 'bout another round? - Yeah, why not? - Alright, so where is the badge? - What? - Oh, I know you're a cop. You look like a cop. So, where's the badge? - I'm not a cop, baby. I'm the doc. I punish people. - Kinky, huh? - Well, see, I'm a special kinda customer with special kind of needs. Got more where that comes from. If you think you can handle the job. - Maybe. - Tell ya what, my van's parked right out front. Meet ya out there in a couple of minutes. - Couple minutes? - Yeah, don't let me down, now. (rock music) (belches) That's intelligent. That's the most intelligent thing you've said to me all night. - That was a quick trick. - Yeah, well, she's a little expensive. I don't have to spend that kinda money on a lady when I can get it for free. - Oh, where's the shovel? It's gettin' a little bit thick around here. - I think I'm gonna go, guys. (laughing) - No, you're not. Everyone's going to my place. I got a cold case on ice and the old lady's gone. - No, no, I'm gonna pass on that tonight. - I don't believe it. The first time Wolf offers to buy and Steve turns him down. - Yeah, I know, I know. Steve is a good little church boy. He has to get up early on Sundays. Ain't that right, Stevie? - Yeah, well, somebody's gotta pray for you poor bastards. - Count me out of your prayers, Stevie. I wanna go to hell with all my friends, ain't that right, boys? Now, go on, goodie two shoes. We got some serious drinkin' to do, here. (belches) (rock music) - Damn bitch. (heels clacking) Thought you run away from me, huh? I wouldn't have liked that. You're really askin' for it, aren't ya? What's this? - Take it. I, uh, I can't do what you want. - Hey, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait a second. What's the matter? Look, I'm sorry. Let me explain something to ya, okay? What I said inside, I didn't mean it. It was just a put on, okay? I didn't mean to scare ya. - No, you didn't scare me. Just don't get into the kinky stuff, got it? - I got it, okay. So, what are you gonna do? I'm payin'. - No, I know guys like you. You can't get it up unless you got somebody tied up and half scared to death. No, thanks. I had my fill with the last guy I shacked up with. - Hey, wait a second. Do I look the kinda guy that's gonna hurt somebody, huh? - Look, there are a lot of girls around here. And some of 'em get into your type of action. So, why me? - I like your smile. - Oh, gimme a break. - Hey, I'll tell ya what. I'll give ya fifty dollars, okay, for a blow-job. That's nice and easy money, hmm? - You're really desperate aren't you? So, why don't you beg me? Go on, get on your knees and beg. - Hundred dollars, baby. Ten minutes easy work. - Looks like I'm not the only sucker 'round here. I can use this. I've got another mouth to feed. - What, do you got a kid? - What difference does it make? - I'm just curious. - Yeah, the father left me holdin' the bag, now I gotta do crap like this to make ends meet. So, where do you wanna do this? - What's the matter? Don't ya like the kid? - What's with you? A kid's a kid. They're all pains in the butt. Be a lot better off if he had come along. Wouldn't have to put up with people like you. Come on, let's get this over with. (heels clacking) Where, in the back? - No, no, no, hey I tell ya what. I got another place, little more private, okay? - No, no I'm going anywhere. - Wait a second, wait a second. Hey, it's just around the corner, okay? After all, I gave ya a hundred dollars, right? Besides, we've got people walking out to their cars. - Okay. (slams) (slams) (engine puttering) (ominous music) Now I can finally get this over with. - You know, he really couldn't help being born. - Are you on my kid, again? What the hell's wrong with you? My kid's my own damn business. Oh, I knew it. I knew it, it's as limp as a wet noodle. - Well, why don't you turn around? Give me a few seconds, huh? - You gotta get yourself started? I guess I've seen it all. I just thought of something. You aren't gay are you? (laughing) - You know, you got a big mouth. - You can just fill it up if you can get your thing to work. (thuds) - What happened to your big mouth, baby, huh? (whimpering) I hope I didn't hit ya too hard, you know? 'Cause there's some things I gotta tell ya, you know what I mean? Bet you're frightened, aren't ya? - Please, don't (crying). - Please, please, don't what, huh? - Don't hurt me! - Don't hit you, is that what you said? Don't hit you? No, I promise I won't hit you. (crying) I'm gonna kill you. - No, no! I'll do anything! - Anything? Anything just ain't enough. Don't scratch so hard, baby. Doors locked. Come on, baby. You really wanna live. Give me a good reason why you wanna live, baby. Pick a reason. - My-- - Huh, my, my, my what? Come on. - My child needs me. - Aw, no, no, he could do a lot better off without you. Aw, now I have your life in my hands totally. Oh. (moaning) (ominous music) God, it's gonna be late. Now you can join the others. (choir music) - Oh, gross. - Shhh, get to work. - Sorry, I'm a little tired this morning. How's everybody doin' on their assignment? (groaning) - Little too much late night activity? - Alright, is everybody about finished? - No, I'm not. I'm stuck on this word, right here. - What word, John? - Begat. - John, why don't you just concentrate on your assignment? - Does begat mean the same thing as F U? (laughing) - John, I'm warning you, that's it. Alright, come on. Everybody hand in your assignments. - I'm not finished. - I didn't ask you to write a novel. - [Kevin] I'm done. - Alright, Kevin, I'll tell ya what we're gonna do. I want each one of you to explain what you've written today, okay? We're gonna start with one of you at a time. You're gonna stand up and explain what you have on your paper. - Oh, wow, we get to hear Kevin's commandment. Thou shalt not be a nerd. (laughing) - Tell ya what, I think we're gonna start with Debbie. - I didn't write one. - [Steve] Why not? - She drew one. - Give it back. - Give it to me, John. - No, give it back. - Debbie hand it over right now. Come on. - No. - Debbie. - No. - Hand it over right now. Come on. - It's no big deal. - [Debbie] Pretty good likeness, don't you think? (laughing) - Alright, Debbie. Let's go. We're going to the office. - No, we're not. - Come on, we're going to the office right now. Right now! - Okay. Okay, okay. Look, I don't why you're making such a big deal about this anyway. - Let's go. Come on. Outside the door, let's go. I'll be right with you. - It's just a picture of a big prick like you. (children laughing) - [Steve] Debbie shut up and wait outside that door. - She's right, you know. - Tonya, you know you could be next. Alright, now listen up. I'm gonna have to get another teacher to come in here, so I want you to keep writing your assignments and I want everybody to be quiet until the teacher gets here. Is that understood? - [Kevin] Mmm hmmm. - What's wrong with you, anyway? - You're makin' a big deal out of nothing. - Nothing. You call this nothing? Where'd you learn how to draw things like this? - From a book. - You know, you are nothin' but a little whore. - Hey, you can't talk to me like that. - You know, you can get yourself into a lot of trouble. God knows everything that we do, everything. What must He think of you now? - God is big drag, and He doesn't exist anyway. - The rate you're going with your life, by the time you're 16 years old you're gonna be nothing but a common street walker. - Who do you think you are, anyway? - Just shut up. You're coming with me. - I'm gonna get you for this. (heels clacking) - Steve. - How do you do, Mrs. Wexler? - Oh, very well, thank you. I hear you're doing a terrific job in the Sunday school department. - Thank you. - Coffee? - No, thank you, not right now. As a matter of fact, I'm having trouble with one of my students. I'm looking for a parent. - Well, it's hard to believe any child would give you any problems. - Thank you for saying so. By the way, you didn't happen to see a Mr. and Mrs. Schultz this morning? - Oh, Mr. Schultz just passed by here a few minutes ago. There he is. That's the gentleman in the brown jacket. - Oh, good, thank you very much. - Mmm hmmm. - Excuse me, Mr. Schultz? - Yes. - I'm Steve Belmont, Debbie's Sunday school teacher. - Oh, I'm pleased to meet you. - Pleased to meet you, sir. - Don't tell me she's in trouble? - Well, sort of. May I see you in the Christian ed office just for a minute? - Certainly, excuse me, please. Alright, what did she do now? - Maybe I'd better discuss this with you in private. - Must be bad. - In class today, we were discussing the Ten Commandments and I assigned a commandment to each student. I asked them to write on how the commandment would affect their modern-day living. When I asked your daughter for her assignment, she informed me that she didn't write anything. She drew this instead. I'm sorry I had to show you. - What kind of a girl have I raised? How could you have done such a thing? - I didn't do it. - I want you to go over there and apologize to Mr. Belmont. - No, I won't. - I want you to do it now. - I'm sorry. - I'm sorry, what? - I'm sorry, Mr. Belmont. - That's alright, Debbie. As long as you always remember who is in control, you'll stay out of trouble. - Let's go. - That was a strange comment you made. What do you mean, "Who's in control?" - Why, God, of course. Who did you think I meant? Come on, let's go have some coffee before it's all gone. (ominous music) - Lovely wardrobe. So, uh, listen. Do you mind if I turn on the radio? Fine, go right ahead.

I'd thought I'd get a few things done. Gonna be doing some laundry, so I'm going to get those towels that I lent you. - Hey, don't worry about it. I'll bring 'em back. - [Neil] Alright, I'm already here. - I said I'll bring 'em back to you. Come on, hurry up. Get out of there. - Oh, where's the washcloth I lent you? - I'll bring it over to you. Don't worry about it. - [Neil] What is the matter with you? - [Steve] I've got a headache. Come on, let's go. Just get out. - Sounds more like you're on your period.

(slams) (smacking) (whistling) - What's in the can, goose? - Trash. I got trash, Neil. Lotta trash. - Where are you going with it? - To the dump. To the dump, Neil. - Today is Sunday. - Yeah, I got a place. I got a special place I dump it off. - Oh, you're taking trash? Well, listen, I've got some at my place-- - No, no, I don't have any room, Neil. Do me a favor and get on the other end and push, will ya? - I've been cutting-- - Push, Neil. - I've been cutting flowers. I'm not dressed for this-- - Neil, get down there and push. - What the hell do you have-- - It's trash, Neil. It's filled with trash. Now get down there and push. Come on. - Oh, alright. My god, what the hell do you have in this thing? - Oh, I got a lot of trash, Neil. - You must have an entire apartment in that thing. - Yeah, I do. I do. See ya, Neil. - Sure you won't let me give you any-- (slams) (ominous music) - Boy, you girls sure are stinkin' up the place. Whoo! Ah! Whoo! (zipping) (eerie music) God, I love the desert. Right, girls? (engine puttering) 'Sup, Neil? - Where have you been? - Out for a drive. - You're plastered and you've been driving? - Oh, bug off! - What did you say? - I said (clinking). - [Neil] The realtor was by. - [Steve] Oh, are we selling? - [Neil] Seems you're behind in your rent, again. - Yeah, and you, you gave him a good excuse. You thought of a real nice one for me, didn't ya (mumbles). Appreciate that, buddy. - No, I didn't even think of a bad excuse for you. - Oh, good, good. - Listen, I'm sick and tired of covering up for you. - Oh, come on, Neil. Do me big favor, will you? Close the door on the way out. - You think I'm kidding. - I know you're not kidding. - I don't know what's the matter with you. You've got a decent job. It's not like you can't afford it. (belches) - Oh, god! - Well, this is it, cuz. From now on, I'm not covering for you. My god, you are pathetic human being. (engine humming) (slams) (heels clacking) (knocking) - Good morning, Steve. So good to see you. I do hope you're feeling better. - I wrote the check yesterday. You should get it in the mail tomorrow. - Three biggest lies in the world. I'll always love you, I won't cum in your mouth and the check's in the mail. - Alright, I'll write ya a damn check. - May I come in? - No. (ringing) Hello? Yes. Oh, yes, how are you? Sure, put him on. - [Caller] Steve, how are you? - Fine, sir, fine, and you sir? - [Caller] Fine, thank you. I'll get right to the point. I don't wanna make you late for work. - No, that's alright. - [Caller] Could you meet me in my office tomorrow evening about eight o'clock? - [Steve] Sure, sure. Mind telling me what's it about? - [Caller] Well, I really would like to talk about it in person. - Yeah, whatever you say. - [Caller] And please don't worry about it. It's just a problem that's cropped up that I'd like to nip in the bud. Hey, listen, we all think you're doing a fine job. - Thank you. - [Caller] See ya tomorrow evening. - Yeah, 'til then. You know you can be the biggest pain in the ass sometimes. - Why, thank you, just doing my job. (ripping) - Here's your damn check. Get outta here. I'm late for work as it is. - This take care of last month's. What about this one? - Look, the truth is, I'm a little overextended right now. If you don't mind, I get paid on Thursday. You'll get your check on Friday. - I'll be here first thing Friday morning. You better have a check for me. Otherwise, I'm gonna give you your three-day notice to pay up or quit and that means leave. (heels clacking) - Alright, alright, I know, I'm late. - Well, well, dinglemoth. What's the excuse this time? - Don't call me that. - Was your wake-up call late? You had to wait for breakfast in bed, right? Just a minute, dinglemoth. I'm writin' ya up for this one. - What? For being five minutes late? - It's 20 minutes late and this is not the first time. - Couple other times. - 11 times in the last 2 months. This is 12. - We'll see what the union has to say about it. - I don't think your union's gonna bail you out on this one. Plan on taking tomorrow off, no pay. I'll just finish this up and bring it out for you to sign. Now get your butt out there. - I don't why I put up with stinkin' job anyway. I got a college degree, which is a lot more than you got. - Why don't you get another job? You're not breakin' my heart. If it wasn't for the union, you'd have been fired a long time ago. Just keep this in mind. This is your second write up. Three's a charm. (huffs) (slams) - [Radio Announcer] Hey gang, Mad Manville coming at ya from QBLA. You still have a half hour commercial-free rock yet so don't go anywhere. That last song was Behind the Door by The Ambassadors of Now. Can you believe those lyrics? It's killing me to know the real you. Hey, I'm tellin' you, it's killin' L.A. to know the real Mojave Murderer. How about that? Nine bodies found in one place and dig this. They were all ladies of the night. I can see it now. Hey, sweetie, want a date? (choking) I guess they got all choked up when they saw his equipment. (heels clacking) (eerie music) (clinking) (clinking) (ominous music) - Hi there. - Hi. - Didn't mean to scare ya. - No, you didn't scare me. You just can't be too careful these days what with a killer on the loose. - What? Do I look like a murderer? - No, you don't. You look like a knight in shining armor here to help a damsel in distress. No, I knew I could trust you. You don't know why, do you? - No, I don't know why. Why, should I, why? - I don't think I'll tell you. I think I'll give you a little time to figure it out. - I got it. Must be my face, that innocent look everybody trusts, right? (chuckling) - Yeah, right. But that's only part of it. - Hey, looks like you got some engine trouble here, huh? - Yeah, I don't know what happened. I was just driving along and the radio got weaker and weaker and then the engine just died. - Wow, sounds like a bad alternator, something like that. You know, I really don't know that much about engines. Tell you what I could do. I could give you a lift someplace. - Could you? Really? Let me just get my purse and lock up the car, okay? - [Steve] Sure thing. - K, I'm ready. Could you take me to my house? - Sure thing. - Oh, great. (ominous music) - Say, listen, I promised a friend of mine I'd pick some things up for him this afternoon. Could I do that before I drop you off? I have to get there before closing time. - No sweat. I just really appreciate everything you're doing for me. - Yeah, right, everything. (ominous music) (engine puttering) - Sure looks deserted. I think we missed him. - Well, I have a key. I have to hurry up and get in now before the alarm gets set. - [Cheryl] What could your friend possibly want here? - [Steve] Tools. He wants his tools. - Do you give up? - What? - [Cheryl] Do you wanna know why I thought I could trust you? - Look, I'm, I'm really not one for games. - [Cheryl] The church. (thuds) - Ah! - [Cheryl] What was that? - Uh, nothing. I just have to return this before I get the other tools. - I hope I didn't cause that. - No. What did you say about the church? - Oh. I, I know you from the church. I was kind of hoping you'd recognize me. I sort of had a crush on you in high school. - [Steve] What's your name? - Oh, I'm sorry, Cheryl. But it's not gonna help you very much. - You know, this may sound bad, but I can't place your name or your face. - Well, it's really hard admitting this sorta thing, but I've kinda admired you from a distance. It's real funny. I would have given my right arm to have talked to you. It's so simple now, but I really did avoid you. - Well, that explains it. It's not silly, it's not silly at all. - Well, thanks for saying so. So, you gonna get these tools? - No, no, it's a little late, anyway. - I'm sorry. I sat here gabbing and you didn't get what you wanted. - No, that's okay. I got something else instead. A secret admirer. (eerie music) (engine puttering) - Thanks a lot. I really appreciate this. Listen, I'm gonna make it up to you. I'm gonna have you over for dinner or something. - Yeah, don't put yourself out. Just start coming to church again, okay? I'm there every Sunday. - I will. Still gonna have you over for dinner. Bye.

How you doin'? - Great, great. - Alright, so what's the mystery? - No mystery, I just wanted a chance to talk to you first. - Mr. Schultz is in my study. Now, I hate to be blunt, but I don't know how else to tell you this. Schultz's daughter has accused you of, God, it's hard to say the words, well, she's accused you of touching her in a wrong way. - What? - I know, I know, I couldn't believe it either. As long as I've known you, as well as I know you, there's no possible way. - What do I do? You know I wouldn't do a thing like that. - I know that. I think even Mr. Schultz deep down knows it too. But it's very important that you tell him. - Yes, but will he believe me? - Well, I've asked Marene Wexler and Richard Blum to join us. They'll act as character witnesses, so to speak. Now, I don't mean to say that you're on trial. - Sure. - Above all, we must remember that Debbie is a deeply disturbed girl. She needs our help and we must assure her father that we're here to help. - Yes, I agree. - Let's go in. You all know Steve. Mr. Schultz, I've asked Mrs. Wexler and Mr. Blum to join us so that they can shed some light on Steve's character. Well, shall we begin? - I'm sorry Steve. - Well, that's alright. You did what you felt you had to do. I don't blame you. - Debbie's lied to me before. This time she was so convincing. I didn't know what to believe. - I'm only happy to come down here and try and help resolve this matter. - Steve. You know what Debbie has accused you of. Now, please don't be offended, but I need to ask you this question point blank. Did you do what she accused you of? - No, absolutely not. I wouldn't dream of doing such a thing. - Alright, that's good. That's fine, Steve. That's what we all needed to hear for ourselves. Now, I'd, um, I'd like to play devil's advocate for a moment if you don't mind. Why would Debbie risk telling such a big lie? You see what I mean? I mean, an outside observer would find it very hard to believe that such a young girl could make up a story like that. - Well, that's a tough one to answer, Reverend Lymen. But I do think I have a theory. What we have here is a girl with a very low sense of self-worth, at least that's what I've noticed lately. I think that Debbie has been reaching for something to boost her self-esteem. I think she's found that something. A sexual involvement with a boy. Well, at least, that's what I've noticed recently. In light of the picture that Debbie drew in Sunday school last Sunday, I think that holds my theory up. - And her accusations about you? - I must admit I'm a little stricter than, than I should be and if that's the case, I do apologize. I think that I was a little harsh with Debbie last Sunday and that's probably the reason why she did what she did. - Please, feel free to chime right in. You're input would be most valuable. - Well, I'd like to say something if I may. I find it incredibly difficult to believe that anyone could level such charges at Steve, of all people. He's a very sensitive and caring person. Why, the youth of our church respond to him very well and I know they must fully trust him. As a matter of fact, he's applied to be the head of the Adolescent Crisis Unit, which the outreach board is about to start up. He's our prime candidate for the job. - Let me add here that Steve's been a Sunday school teacher for five years now, and I can say as chairman of the Christian education board, he's one of our finest teachers. - Let me add an observation of my own. Steve here has done more to bolster the youth activities of this church than anyone I know. - Everything you say is true. My daughter's such a vicious liar. She'd do anything to destroy a person's life. I'm sorry, Steve, for the trouble my family's caused you. - Consider it forgotten. And please do tell Debbie that I forgive her and that I sincerely wish that she continues coming to church on Sunday. - Your forgiveness is far more than she deserves. You try to raise a family the best, and then (weeping). - Dinglemoth. Enjoy your day off? - Only a lowlife like you would rub that in, but since you asked, I got a lot accomplished yesterday. Thank you very much. - It's my pleasure. - Really? I have another job lined up. One that requires sensitivity, intellect, knowledge of other people, three departments that you seem to be lacking in. - God, you're a pain in the butt, dinglemoth. Gonna be a pleasure to see you leave. - I'll oblige you soon enough. - Not soon enough for my liking. Now, get the hell out there and remember, I'm watching. (bell rings) (galloping) - [Angela] Yes, fine, thank you. - [Joe] Okay, tell me what happened. - Well, first, let me say, Mr. Turner, I really think there shouldn't be someone like this creature at the Association Day and John is livid, let me tell you, he is livid. Now-- - Wes, Joe, ma'am. - Belmont. I believe you have met Mrs. Titer. - We met this afternoon. - Yeah, it's about that meeting this afternoon that we're having this one. Just hold on. Please go on, Angela. - Well, I was going to see John and I was late, as usual and, well, you know how John is when you're late (chuckling). And so I was rushing through the gate. - She almost ran me over. - That's not true, and I'm not surprised that um, Mr.-- - Belmont, Steve Belmont. - Belmont thought that because when he breathed on me, when he spoke to me, he reeked of beer. - No, no, no. See, what happened was, she had an expired permit on her car, first of all. Second of all, a guy come runnin' through just a couple cars before and he had beer inside his car and he threw it inside of my cage and got it on me. - I would prefer to think that Mr., um-- - [Steve] Belmont, Steve Belmont. - Whatever was drinking because when I got out of my car, he threw me up against my car. - He physically-- - [Angela] Physically threw me up against the car-- - That's a lie. - And he said, "I hope someone like "the Mojave Murderer gets you. "You bitch." - Why doesn't this surprise me, Wes? I think we can talk now, huh? Thanks a lot, we'll be right back. We just have to take care of this business, okay? Just one second, you'll be fine. Behave yourself. - You're dead. - What did you say? - I said you're one dead bitch. - Joe! - What's happened? - [Angela] He threatened me again. I'm calling John. - [Joe] What the hell did-- - I didn't say a word. I didn't do a thing. - You know, you're one big screw up, Belmont. Guys like you give the union a bad name. Told Joe he can do whatever he needs to. Yeah, and Joe just decided that's warning number three. Thanks a lot, dinglemoth. This is big day for me. Tomorrow's your last day. Pick up your check tomorrow. You're history. - The name is Belmont, and I quit. - [Joe] Do I have to call security? - No, you don't have to. Thanks a lot, Wes. Thanks a lot for stickin' up for all the union guys. I'll pass the word around. (choir music) Is anybody home? - Predictable. You would barge in through the most beautiful passage. - (chuckles) Little champagne to celebrate my freedom. - Oh, you got canned again? - Oh, no, I quit, you see. I'm not gonna take it from those bastards or their job. - [Neil] You have another job lined up? - As a matter of fact, I do. I have been appointed the head of the new Adolescent Crisis Unit. - Oh, what a joke. That thing has been in the planning stages for over two years. That's not a sure thing. It'll probably be another two years before it gets off the ground. Now, if I were you-- - No, you're not me, Neil, okay? - Thank god. - So just lay off, alright? I can take care of my own life. - [Neil] Yes, I can certainly see that. - Neil, go in and get the glasses. Let's celebrate the new Steve Belmont. - The old Steve Belmont gave me enough grief, thank you. So, tell me, what is the new Steve Belmont going to do about the back rent owed by the old Steve Belmont? - You know, your thinkin' is so outdated. - [Neil] It may be outdated, but it's practical. - You're never gonna get anywhere in life being practical. - Alright. Okay, good luck. I hope everything turns out just the way you want it. - I'll drink to that. (mumbling) (ringing) Hello? - [Caller] Steve. So pleased to catch you in. Just calling to see if you have a check ready for me. - Can't you ever leave me alone? - [Caller] Does that mean you don't? - Look, I just lost my job yesterday, so, can't you give me a little more time? - [Caller] A little more time. You may as well pack your bags, 'cause you're history in that apartment. - Hey, what's the problem with you, anyway? Can I have just two more weeks? - [Caller] Two more weeks. I'm coming out there to post a three-day notice. - And you'll need to sign this. - I don't have to sign anything. I came here to pick up my check, thank you. - You get no check, thank you, until you sign that. - Eh, it doesn't make any difference. When my lawyer gets finished with you, you're gonna wish you never dealt with me. - A lawyer? You don't quit, do you? - [Steve] I have a good case. - A good case? You're a joke, dinglemoth. I had John Titer in here after your blood. I found out you been drinking on the job. You're always late, and now, you've gone and insulted the wife of the biggest trainer in this track. (chuckles) You haven't got a goddamn thing. But you're gonna get a good, swift kick in the ass if you don't get outta here right now. (clinking) Get outta here! Dammit! (eerie music) (engine puttering) (slams) - [Loudspeaker] Cashier to row six, please. Cashier to row six. (heels clacking) - Hi there. Excuse me. Excuse me, miss? Hi, I'm Steve Belmont, Neil's cousin. You know where I can find him around here? - Probably in the office. - Great, uh, where's that at? - Over there. - Over there? - What'd I just say? - Over there. Thank you, thank you very much. - [Loudspeaker] Price check at register four, please. Price check at register four. (knocking) - Uh huh, yes, no, I understand. Come in. Anytime, but preferably on Monday. Yes, yes, thank you very much. Alright, alright, goodbye. Well, what a surprise. To what do I owe this honor? - Well, I uh-- - [Neil] Just down here for a visit? - Yeah, actually. - Well, if you'll wait around just a minute, we can grab lunch, alright? - Yeah, sure, that sounds great. But listen, Neil, I gotta talk to ya about something. - Alright. - I need to borrow some more money. - Ah, so that's why you're down here. - Yeah, I had another visit from my realtor this morning, and of course you know I lost my job. - I thought you quit your job. - Yeah, lost, quit, look. He's gonna throw me out of the apartment. - I don't blame him. - Look, Neil, I just need some money to tie me over for a while. I'll pay the rent and pay some food bills, you know what I mean? I'm gonna start my job at the unit. - If I were you, I wouldn't count on that job at the unit. Those things have a way of being delayed indefinitely. - Alright, so what are you saying? You tellin' me you're not gonna loan me the money? - I'm not saying that I won't lend you the money. - [Steve] Alright, then, what? - I'll lend you the money but under one condition. - What's that? - [Neil] That you take a job. - A job? - Here, in this store. - What job? - What difference does it make? A job is a job. It'll pay the rent. Look, Steve, uh, I lost my janitor. You can take the job as a janitor. Well, it's a job. It'll pay the rent. - You want me to be a janitor? - We have to make some sort of an arrangement. You have a very bad history of not repaying debts. Think about it. (knocking) Yes. - Excuse me. - Yes, thank you. Well, what's your decision? - Sure, when you want me to start? - Good, I knew you'd see the point. Why don't you start right now? - How 'bout tomorrow morning? I got some errands to take care of. - Fine, fine, I'll see you tomorrow morning at eight A.M. - And uh, Neil, what about the money? - Oh. Listen, Steve, I think that this'll work out just fine, okay? - You can just make it five hundred. - I'll make it for the rent. (tense music) - Excuse me, uh, perhaps you could help me. I'm a little lost here. You live around here, you know these streets? - Uh huh. - I'm looking for 1564 Bangar Street. You know where that is? - Doesn't ring a bell. - Uh, it's supposed to be close to Lincoln Avenue. - Yeah, take this street 'til you get to the end and turn right 'til you get to the next street, turn right 'til you get to Lincoln. There's a school right there on the corner. Make a right, follow it all the way down 'til you hit Bangar. - Okay, I get down to the school and I make a right? - Uh huh. - Okay. Thanks a lot, appreciate it. Hey. I don't mean to sound forward or anything like that. I'm a photographer and uh, I'm really thinkin' about using you in some still photography work. I saw you walking and I thought why not? You ever done any modeling work? - You're kidding, right? - No, I'm serious. Here's my card, right here. That's me, Frank. Frank Gargone. I do a lot of studio work and the weddings. That pays my bills. But I do stills of models, that's my life. I love it. - What make you think I'm a model? - You are kidding, you're perfect. You are photogenic, seriously. You are beautiful. You've got the looks that women dream of. The woman's woman look. I mean, I mean, it's perfect, come on. Hey, I tell what I'm gonna do. I'm gonna give ya a hundred dollars for the shoot. A couple hours of easy work, what do ya say? - I better ask my mom, first. - Your mom? Wait a minute, you are 18, aren't you? - Yeah. - No, seriously, you gotta be 18 to do this. - Yeah. - Alright, if you're 18, why ask your mom? You can make your own decisions. - Well, I live at her house and I have to-- - I tell ya what we'll do. Let's go over to my office, okay? I'm gonna draw up a contract for ya, okay? While I'm drawing up the contract, call up your mom. If your mom says no, I'll tear up the contract. That'll be it. If she says yes, let's do the pictures, I'll have ya back by the time dinner's ready. - Can't we just go by her house and-- - Time is money. I'm losing that natural light. I need it, okay? - Then how 'bout tomorrow? - Tomorrow's too late. Gotta have the pictures in. You know I gotta submit the pictures on Monday morning. I gotta see 'em through the lab over the weekend. - I can't decide. - I'll tell ya what I wanna do. I'm gonna give ya ten percent of the contest money if we win. That's up to five hundred dollars on top of the hundred. I said a hundred, right? That's six hundred dollars you could make a couple hours easy work. If we lose, you're still gonna make a hundred dollars. Can't lose either way. - I can call her from your house? - You can call her as soon as you get there. - How far is it? - Alright, it's just a couple miles, come on. (ominous music) Well, it's not Taj Mahal but I like it. My studio's in the back. Uh, this is where I live, up front. It's better for security, know what I mean? - It's isolated. - Yeah, yeah, well you know, with the security problems we have around here and soforth, besides, it has a great ambiance. You'd love it. I'm sorry about the mess, with the picture and all, my maid quit on me yesterday and gee whiz, I don't know how to speak Spanish, you know what I mean? Why don't ya sit down and relax? - I better call my mom first. - Oh, don't worry about your mom. Gee whiz, let her worry about you for once. Let her appreciate you, alright? Would you like some wine? - Yeah. - White wine, be right back. I always said a little bit of wine's great for the models. It helps ease the mind and the nerves and gives you that aggressiveness, too, you know what I mean? That's what we need for our picture. Oh, thirsty little devil, aren't you? Little more? - Please. - Tipsy, now, don't get drunk on me. You'll have to excuse me for a moment. Be right back. Gonna set up my cameras. - The wine's good. So when do we start taking pictures? I'm aggressive now. (eerie music) What are you doing in there? Come on. When do we start? I'm calling my mom. - I told you not to call your mother. Put the phone down. Do everything I say and everything'll be alright. - What is this? - What is this? Why, this is a gun, what do you think it is? You be a quiet little girl and everything'll be okay. - What do you want? - You know what I want. (ominous music) - No. - Oh, yes. - I won't. - Oh, you will. You know what I want. You know what I want. Come on, baby, give me what I want. - No, mom. - Give me what I want. Mom? Mom? Mom is dead. You wanna visit mom? Come on, baby, start in. Hurry up, I don't have all day. Come on. (sobbing) Why don't you just close your eyes? Close your eyes and enjoy it. Come on, close your eyes, now. Yeah. Don't stop. That's it. Yes. That's nice, don't stop, come on. That's nice, isn't it? Huh? (screaming) - Ah, no. No! (ominous music) - Oh, from the depths I cry unto thee, oh Lord of hopes. Yeah, though I walk through the valley of the shadow. (eerie music) God, that was great. Best since the first one. Thank you who ever you were. (eerie music) Oh, dammit. (thuds) - Well, this is a great way to start your first day. You're late. - Sorry 'bout that. - Cut the crap and come inside. I want you here at eight A.M. sharp. Is that understood? Sit down. On the chair, on the chair. I want you to fill this out and then I'll show you around. - Pen? Where do I fill it out? - You can read, can't you? There are times when I am amazed that we are related. Most days, the heavy work on this job will be finished by about ten A.M. and you'll probably be able to leave about 1:30. Whenever they need you, they will page you over the loudspeaker and tell you what aisle to go to. Sign it. Okay. Come on. (soft music) Well, what a pleasant domestic scene. (tapping) What's the matter with you? You come in 20 minutes late and now you're taking a 45 minute coffee break? Haven't you heard them paging you for the past-- Some broad plopped a diaper on aisle five and you've got to clean it up. Don't look at me. It's your job. (heels clacking) - You know what I think of your job, Neil? I think you can shove it up your wazzoo. In fact, I know you can shove it up your brain wazzoo, Neil. (crashing) Hey Neil, how you like that, huh? That's what I think of your job, Neil. (heels clacking) Cheryl. - Hi, I'm back in church. - It's good to see you. Thought a lot about you since we met. - Be still my beating heart. It's too much for a girl to think that a tall, handsome man would think of her in the middle of the week. - Oh, you kissed the blarneystone, I see. - Hi Mom. - Hi, hon. - Mrs. Wexler is your mother? - Marene, please, I don't wanna sound older than I am. - It's a small world. - That's exactly what I said when I found out it was you that helped Cheryl out the other day. Many thanks. - It's my pleasure. - Well, it's very reassuring to know there's a Good Samaritan in the world, especially with that murderer on the prowl. - Mom, you don't have to worry about me. I can take care of myself. - That's exactly what I do worry about. Oh, did you read there was a body of a teenage girl found? Nobody is safe with the Mojave Murderer. - Well, just let the killer try and come after me. I'll show him what's what. - Oh, how would you do that? - Well, don't let this get around, but when I get mad, I get really mad. And uh, I become a she-wolf. Grrr. Just let him try anything. I'd go after the jugular, rawh! (chuckling) - See why I worry? By the way, what are you planning for dinner tonight? - Oh, nothing really, I was just gonna go home and sit around and dream what's it like to sit down to a home cooked meal. - Oh, brother, just when I was trying to invite you, you go ahead and invite yourself. Well, how 'bout dropping by around five o'clock? - Great. I think I remember how to get there. - You better. - What? Are you cooking? - I'm opening the can of beans. - Marvelous. I'm sure Steve can hardly wait. (melancholy music) (doorbell rings) - Hi, Steve. Fancy meeting you here. Oh, for little ole' me? Mmm, come on in. Look who's here. - [Marene] Hi Steve. Flowers, how pretty. You shouldn't have. - They're for both of us, Mommy dearest. - She's still at it. I hope you like veal parmesan. - Smells wonderful. - How 'bout some wine? - I'd love some. Thank you. - Are we gonna tell him now? - Shhh. - Alright, what are you two up to? - How 'bout a toast? Cheryl, you do the honors. - Oh, to the head of the Adolescent Crisis Unit. - Here, here. The committee left it up to me to tell you. I thought this would be an appropriate time. - I'm speechless. - You deserve it. - It's what I've always dreamed of, to be in an important position of service to this community. - That's exactly what impressed the committee at your interview. They knew you meant it because of all your volunteer work at the church. - I've always tried to live my faith. - I'm proud of you. - Thank you. And I think I will drink to that. Alright, what are you staring at? - Are you happy? - Yes, of course, why? - I don't know. You realized a dream, tonight. It just seems like you oughta be out doing backflips instead of sitting here calmly eating your dinner. - I'm adjusting to the idea. Besides, I don't believe it completely. Not until it actually becomes a reality. - Oh, it's true, believe it. You threw your hat in the ring and you were chosen. You deserve it. - Even so, I won't believe it completely until it happens. I've always learned in the past something gets in the way of the best laid plans. - That's not true. You just have to want it hard enough and work at it long enough. It'll always come true. - Wow, what a dreamer. - She takes after her father, God rest his soul. Oh, by the way, Ed Eubanks wants to meet with you. He's the man who's putting up most of the money for the crisis unit. - Certainly, I'd like to meet him, anytime. - He's a shrewd businessman who knows how to protect his interests. But I think you'll find him a likable man. I know I did. - I'm sure I will. (melancholy music) Thank you again for this evening. I had a wonderful time and I'm glad I got to know you. - It was my pleasure, believe me. - I have just one question. - What's that? - Is this the start of something? - I'll answer your question with a question. - And what's that? - Are you gonna kiss me or not? Mmmm, that was nice. You better call me. - You know, you're something else. You bet I will. (melancholy music) (knocking) Come in. - Here's the tie you wanted to borrow. - Oh, thank you very much, Neil. I think this'll work just fine. - Oh, perfect. Don't drool on it. (slams) What's the big occasion? - I got a meeting with Ed Eubanks today. He's the man puttin' up all the money for the uh, unit. - So, that things really gonna go through? I'm surprised. - That's right. It's really gonna go through. - Well, I guess that means you won't be working for me very long. - I realize I have to give up a lucrative field now, but we all have to make, uh, sacrifices for our social responsibilities, huh? (whistling) You still out there, Neil? - Uh huh. - Hey, what are doing with that? Gimme that. - When the hell did you ever graduate from college? - Just give it to me. - What is that? From the LaSalle matchbook university? - No, I just had to go back and finish up. - Well, next you'll be telling me you're a mail-order priest. - There's a lot you don't know about me, Neil. - You have a stain on this tie! I gave it to you just five seconds ago. - Don't worry about it. Close the door on the way out. - [Neil] For Christ's sake. - I'm really very happy with your resume. This is impressive, very impressive. But I have one question, Steve. With all of your credentials, why haven't you gone into private practice? - I'm very glad you asked me that question. That same thought has been going through my head for the last few years. I've always felt that serving the community should be the psychologist's highest goal. And in private practice, psychologists always think of their profits coming first and serving the community coming last. And I've always felt that sacrificing to the community should come first, so I protested by staying out of private practice, and waited for the opportune situation to come along and I think this is the one. - That's very commendable. But if you don't mind, I'd like to ask you a personal question. - [Steve] No, not at all. - Are you married? - I'm single. - And why aren't you married? - I just never had the time or money to think of settling down and getting married. My education comes first. It's been six long years to get that degree. - According to this resume, it's been seven years. - Well, yes, seven years in time, but, yes. - I see. Excuse me. Marene, are you sure that all the money I'm going to invest is tax-deductable and that the corporation's name will appear on all literature concerned with the project? - Absolutely. - Well, the committee seems satisfied. Why don't I ring for the butler? He can bring us some drinks and we can toast Steve Belmont. A man more concerned with self-sacrifice than self-gain. A Christian in the truest sense of the word. - [Loudspeaker] Clean up on aisle eight, please. Clean up on aisle eight. - Don't you believe in knocking? And what's the matter with you? You're 20 minutes late. - Big deal. - What? - I said, I quit. - Now wait a minute. - I quit. Q-U-I-T. - What about your debt to pay? - I got your debt. - You're supposed to give me notice. - This is your notice, cousin. - Like hell. What am I supposed to do for a custodian? Alright, bozo, remember this the next time you want a favor. Son of a bitch. - [Loudspeaker] Steve to aisle five please. - Oh, Steve. Could you take over for just a minute? Come on. There's something I want to show you. (heels clacking) Well, this is it. - What? - The church just assigned this office space. It's the new Adolescent Crisis Unit. - It's really gonna happen. Really coming through. Whose idea is this? - [Marene] I knew you'd be surprised. - It's perfect. Right here in the church. What can I ask for? - Oh, the church is gonna get new locks and keys by the middle of next week. - Then it's all gonna be mine. - Mmm hmm. - Perfect. Great, great. (ringing) - Hello? - [Steve] Cheryl? - Hi, Steve. - [Steve] What are you doing tonight? - Oh, just some studying I'd like an excuse to get out of. - [Steve] Let's get together tonight. - Okay, what's up? - [Steve] A surprise. - Steve, I hate suspense. - [Steve] I'll be there in 20 minutes. - Steve? Steve? Men. Usually you're so cool about everything. Not this job. - It's really gonna happen, you know? It's really gonna happen. - It is happening, and I'm jealous. Gonna take all your time. - Not necessarily. - Oh, yes it is. That's why I've rearranged my schedule, so I can work for you at least part-time. - Oh, really? You're really that good, aren't you? - Yes, I am. - Alright. And nothing's gonna stop me. (melancholy music) (moaning) - I love you Steve. Oh. Let's make love. Right here. What's the matter? - Nothing. - Steve, what's wrong? - I'm gonna have the desk coming out from here, you know? With the point in the middle. - Steve. What just happened? - Nothing. - I don't understand. You just got me all, uh, nothing. - You know the problem with you? You're selfish. - What? - I said you're selfish. (eerie music) I gotta go to the head. - Wait. It's alright. It's nothing to be ashamed of. You're worried about your new job, that's all. (eerie music) (toilet flushes) (mumbling) He does family counseling. Sometimes he can really help out. Listen, why don't you stay with us for a while? Maybe, I think we can talk about this. - Look, lady, I just asked you for some money. If you don't wanna give it to me, that's fine. - Cheryl? - Wait, come back. I wanna help you. That's odd. What an odd little girl. - What did she want? - She said she was running away from home. Couldn't stay there anymore. Something about her dad. She said she needed bus fare to get to a relative's out of town. What is it? - Nothing. That's just the oldest con in the book. Whatever she wanted that money for, it wasn't bus fare. - No, you don't think she was conning me? - Oh, yeah, kids always get a kick out it. (mumbling) Besides, it's an easy way of making a fast buck. Drug money, probably. Come on, let's go. - What about my stuff? - I'll go get it. You wait here. (eerie music) Ready? - Sure. - Let's go. - She really suckered me in. - Yeah, see, I know all about this because I've been suckered a few times, myself. - She sure ran when you came. - Yeah, I think she knew her gig was up. I could smell a con right off the bat. - Poor girl. Maybe she really did need the money, Steve. - Nah. No, I don't think so. I think she can take care of herself. She probably lives in the neighborhood. - You think so? - Sure. You see how she took off running between the houses? Probably lives in the block. - You're probably right. You wanna come in for a while? - No, I don't think so, really. I've got to get up early in the morning. Thanks anyway. - It has been kind of a strange evening, I guess. I'm kind of burned out, too. Well, good night. - Hey listen, uh, after the unit gets going, I'll be myself again. - I'm sure you will. (eerie music) - Shhh, Debbie, it's me, Steve. - Shit, man, you scared the crap out of me. - I knew you'd come back, Debbie. Come on out from underneath the desk. Come on, sit down. - You're gonna turn me in, aren't you? - Calm down. - I'm in trouble. - I'm not gonna do anything right away. Let's talk about this, okay? - Talk, bullshitty talk. - Why'd you run away from home? - It's too messed up to go into. I just don't wanna live there anymore. - Why? - Let's not get into this. Just turn me in or whatever. I'll go like a good little puppy dog. - Alright, alright. If your heart's really set into it. If you'd like, you can come over to my place. Spend the night, crash on the couch. I've got some food in the refrigerator. When was the last time you ate? - Why you doin' this? - Let's just say I feel bad about what happened in the classroom. The way I saw your father react, I figured this'd be the best way to make it up to you. Mind you, though, it's just for the night. Tomorrow morning you have to decide what you want to do. - Even after all the trouble I caused you? You'd do this? - Lord taught us to always turn the other cheek. - Oh, man, you really live that crap, don't you? - I believe in it, yes. - Okay, I'll go. If I'd have known you were a decent guy, maybe I wouldn't have caused you so many problems. Let's go, I'm starving. (ominous music) (weeping) - I should have helped her. She was conning me for money. I thought she'd be alright. - Shhh. - As she was leaving, I had her thinking, I thought that there was something wrong. I should have done something more. - Okay, you did the best you could. - [Steve] I feel good. Really alive. I just wish there was some way I could cheer you up. - [Cheryl] I'm sorry. It was a bad idea for me to come out today. I feel really out of it. - It was that girl, wasn't it? Cheryl, there's nothing we could do about it. Listen, you're gonna have to learn something. If you want to be working at that unit, you're gonna have to learn how to cope with these things. - How do I learn to cope with the murder of a young girl? - I didn't mean that, in particular. I'm talking about in general. I mean, maybe sometimes, no matter what you say or do, these youngsters are gonna go out there and they're gonna do what they wanna do, even if it means hurting themselves. - You're right, of course. - Cheryl, I don't mean to be preaching like I know everything, but in this particular situation, it was her fault. - How can you say that? How can you say it was her fault that she was murdered by a monster? You think this is funny. - No, I don't think it's funny. I think your reactions are funny. Cheryl, the girl was a con-artist, couldn't you tell that? She went out into the street alone. She knew the dangers were there. She just figured she could go out and handle them on her own. I think she was a little surprised when she found out that she couldn't. Look, I didn't mean it to sound that way. What I'm really trying to say to you is, are we really that guilty? - Yes, we are. Society is guilty. It's guilty because it creates a situation that forces a young girl out into the street. It's guilty because it creates a monster that would take advantage of that young girl. We're guilty because we're part of society, Steve. - I don't know what you're trying to say. - I had a strange thought the other night, and the more I thought about it, the less strange it got. What if the murderer knows that that office is the Adolescent Crisis Unit? - Yeah, so? - Well, think about it a minute. All he'd have to do is lurk around until some troubled kid came along, and then, one less teenager. It would be our responsibility. - You have a vivid imagination. - That unit would be like bait for his victims. - So, what are you saying? - I guess I'm trying to say that I don't like feeling helpless. So, I went to Ed Eubanks and I told him how I felt. He agrees with me. Ed's going to withhold funding from the unit until the killer is caught. (ominous music) Steve, what's the matter? Steve, you're scaring me. - What am I supposed to do? You had to interfere, didn't you? You know I quit a job to be the head of that unit. - Aren't you being a little selfish? Doesn't the safety of the kids come first? - Leave it to a woman to fuck things up. - Steve. - I trusted you. Dammit, dammit. (clinking) (ringing) - Hello? - [Steve] Hello, Marene? - Oh, Steve. - [Steve] Is it true that Ed has withheld the funding? - Oh, Cheryl must've told you. - [Steve] It's true, then? - Yes, Ed thought it best. - [Steve] You mean you thought it best. - Steve, are you alright? - [Steve] Oh, I never felt better. - I know it must come as a shock, but, oh, it's only temporary until they find that killer. - [Steve] Absolutely. I wholeheartedly agree. - I'm glad you feel that way. - [Steve] Say, Marene, I'm afraid Cheryl and I got into an argument and she left in a bit of a huff before I could apologize. Do you know where she might go when she's upset? - Oh, no, no, no. Unless she's at one of her girlfriends. - [Steve] I'm gonna try to find her, but if she gets home before I see her, will you tell her how sorry I am? - Yes, of course, but I wouldn't let it worry you. Steve? - You don't know how insensitive you sound. - I know, I know, you're right. Listen, I am sorry for the way I acted. Everything will turn out for the best. - Maybe I was a little insensitive, too. I mean, after all, the job meant a lot to you. - No, no, you were absolutely right. I think that the safety of these children should always come first. Listen, uh, why don't we get out of here? Let's go for a drive, huh? - That sounds really good. - [Steve] We can go to my favorite place. - [Cheryl] Where's that? - [Steve] The desert. - [Cheryl] What the hell's out there? - [Steve] Peace. - [Cheryl] This is so beautiful. I'm glad we came out here. Steve, anything wrong? - [Steve] No, nothing. - [Cheryl] God, this is sure deserted. You sure you know where you're going? - [Steve] Absolutely sure. (engine puttering) (ominous music) - What's wrong? - Oh, nothing. - We're in the middle of nowhere. What is it? - You just had to interfere, didn't you? - What are you talking about? - Something good comes along and you have to fuck it up! - Ah! What are you doing? - You women are all the same, aren't you? As soon as something good comes along, you gotta fuck it up! - You're scaring me! - Oh, I'm sorry about that. Hey, look, if you don't like it, why don't you just get the hell out? - Don't do this, Steve. - That's it. You think you can survive out there, out in the middle of nowhere? Hey, maybe the old coyotes'll get ya, huh? Remember when we first met? - Why are you doing this? - Huh? Huh? I was gonna kill you! That's right. You've heard of the Mojave Murderer. Well, I killed all of 'em, even that girl, Debbie. She was the best one of them all! - [Cheryl] Don't hurt me! - Hurt you? I'm gonna blow your fuckin' head off! - [Cheryl] No! (thuds) (ominous music) - Now I'm gonna have some fun with you, baby. Yes, it's time to squeeze the life out of you, you bitch! Shall I go through with it or not, huh? - I love you, please. - Love me? What the fuck's that got to do with it? If you love me, you won't die so quickly. (choking) (mumbling) - Come here, come here. - [Steve] What? - Kiss me. - Kiss you? Kiss you? Oh, you really get off on this, don't you, baby? (moaning) Ah! (screaming) (whimpering) - You son of a bitch! You son of a bitch! - No, no, no, Cheryl. - You son of a bitch! - No, Cheryl! No! (gunshot) Ah! (groaning) - Goddammit. God damn you. All those people! All those people you killed. (gunshot) I'm gonna kill you for all those people. (gunshot) - You're right, you're right, I'm wrong. (gunshot) (screaming) (tense music) (groaning) (sniffling) (sobbing) (eerie music) - Oh, God. (whimpering) (eerie music) (wind whooshing) (eerie music)
