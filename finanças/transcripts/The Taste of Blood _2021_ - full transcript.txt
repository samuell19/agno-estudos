Everyone on this earth has a purpose. Also an opportunity to do good. At least that's what I've always believed. It's not complicated. You will live a good life and you be kind to one another. People shouldn't have to worry about evil in this world, it just brings about unnecessary pain, torment, suffering and tears. Of course, there is evil in this world, and I've seen a small measure of it myself in the form of resentment, vindictiveness, and spite, but true evil, I never expected to actually meet it. I mean really why would I? Why would anyone? No. Around my neck. No. Around my neck. No. Three, two. No. Here, I'm counting from ten okay? No, just go five. Nine, eight, seven. Forget it, I'm not having this conversation. And they killed two guys that were running a sex slave operation. No, not now. Yeah but Ken got passes in Disney World. But there're still some assholes who's pushing drugs to little kids. Killed the man, who poisoned his entire family. They're out, seeing a movie with Ken, he's a nice guy, very dependable. Wife, and six kids, the youngest three months old. Have you seen this young man before? No, doesn't look familiar. That's what I used to think too, but they're not, they're anything but. You can never be too careful out here, sheriff. You never know what ne'er-do-well, might be standing on that porch. Telling you they're not like other people. Edna, Harley, Sheriff Fields. What the hell is going on here, if it's not over it'll never be over. You gotta listen to me. they killed people. They're not just cannibals, this is what people don't understand. I keep telling you, they're not like other people. But you got to listen to me they killed people. Edna, Harley, Sheriff Fields. Come on, damn it, fuck it. Fuck off. Oh god. Danny, how you doing? I'm fine, how about you? Not bad, not bad at all. You look like shit. Yeah, you've said that before, thanks. Here, have a seat. Where? Oh yeah, Right there. Nice place. Oh, that's convenient. Goes where I got to go. Just suits me fine. Hey, you want a coffee? No, thanks, I've had your coffee. I got Scotch, you want some of those? For God's sake Nate, it's 10 in the morning. Suit yourself. Still running around chasing those serial killers? I've been close. I've been really, really close. Yeah, it's like, how the hell do you get by? I'm a private investigator, am I not? It's enough? Yeah, much business? Cheating husbands and wives mostly. I don't even need a camera. I just follow them along and take pictures on my cell phone. You wouldn't believe some of these people, Christ they don't even bother to close the blinds. Listen, I may have something for you. Like what? You remember Spider Evan's in vice? Sure, what about him? He's retiring, he's starting up a security company wants to hire former cops, I thought of you. No, no, sorry Dan that's not for me. I need to move on whenever I get a lead. For Christ sake Nate, it's been over 20 years. You've lost everything. Your family, your job, you've got to let this nonsense go. Dan, it's not nonsense. I know what I know. You realize that your husband and wife cannibal team were in their nineties 20 years ago, so what? There were 110 years old now, they're still running around murdering people? They're not just cannibals. This is what people don't understand. They rejuvenate by eating others. With the Whalens, when they disappeared, they became younger, transformed, and they were seen. Not by anyone reliable and a young couple running around in the Whalen's sports car, probably meant the young couple stole the Whalen's sports car. Maybe they even killed the Whalens. No, no way, not a chance. God look, the evidence never supported your claims. Evidence, that's bullshit, that's not true. There was a newspaper, and they said that my account was credible. They wrote an extensive article, a big one. The Richmond Rattler? Not exactly the Washington Post now, is it? Okay let's suppose, you're right about these people and they were cannibals. Don't you think time would have taken care of them? I mean, simple attrition. I mean, come on Nate, do the math. I keep telling you they're not like other people because that's the thing they don't age for Christ's sake. Still got that old bird? Wally, he died over a year ago. How old was he anyway? I have no idea. Really old, ancient. Listen, do me a favor. Give the job some thought would ya? There's more to life than just running around the country chasing ghosts. Tea. Thank you, dear. Are you sure you don't want something to eat with that? No, I'm fine. There's nothing like a hot cup of tea on a cold day. I could warm up some croissants or tea biscuits. No, thanks dear. Okay, I'll be going then. Bye dear. You haven't been eating much lately, you got to keep up your strength. Oh, Harley you fuss too much. You know I can't help it. I worry sometimes. What'd you look at that. What is it Harley. It's an article about this John X. Smith guy. What about him? Says here he's gone missing. Oh, that's all. It's stupid, it's ridiculous. If you asked someone where they're going, nobody ever says, oh, I think I'll go missing. That bothers you, does it? Yes. A lot of things seem to bother you these days. That is true. Does it bother you as much as clowns? Oh Edna, there's no comparison. You know how much I hate clowns, they are just plain creepy. What about mimes? Don't even get me started on them. Then there are those Morris dancers you like so much. Grown men dancing around with bells on their legs waving hankies. Yes, I've got you. We're going north, buddy. Get over here now, something big has happened, now right now, unbelievable. Finally. Danny, get in here. Hey. Hey, have a seat. Thanks. Wait 'til you hear this. Local con man disappears, foul play suspected, John X. Smith. He was running a Ponzi scheme targeting the elderly John X. Smith, right? Like that's his real goddamn name. Ponzi scheme. Yeah, got millions from those people. I'm sure a lot of people would like to see this guy dead. Not just the old people he conned but their families too. But they wouldn't actually do it. His car was gone and forensics only found a trace of blood at the scene. Now you and I both know that people who kill out of anger, they're not that organized. No car, no body. I mean, maybe he faked his own murder. I mean, he wouldn't be the first one. No, it's them. I know it is. So dig this. They don't just kill anybody. They only kill people that have done bad things. So a picky eaters. They're not your garden variety serial killers. Like there is such a thing. Well, they work as a team that's the first thing. Okay hold on. There've been a lot of murderers working as teams over the years. I mean, Florida, back in the eighties, Ottis Toole, and Henry Lee Lucas, some people estimate as many as a hundred deaths. Yeah, I know all that crap. California same time period. Charles Ng and Leonard Lake, 25 people. These people are different. Oh, okay you wanna talk nuts. There was that guy in California I forget how many murders but he said that the killings were some form of necessary evil, like a kind of human sacrifice that would prevent earthquakes. I mean what a wacko. No, no, no, Danny, you got to wrap your head around this. They're not like anybody else. Just look, look where I've tracked them. Okay, pay attention? New Orleans, a bed and breakfast. They killed a man who murdered his wife for her money. Then over to San Francisco, they owned an art gallery and killed a man who was moving drugs inside of antiquities. Boulder, they had a small cafe and they killed two guys that were running a sex slave operation. And off to Savannah, and there they had a candy shop where they killed some asshole who was pushing drugs to little kids. And up to Chicago, they ran a nursery school and they killed a man who was planning on killing his own kid for the insurance. And then Boston, you're gonna love this one, a funeral parlor. Well, that's appropriate kind of a make work project. Well, that's appropriate kind of a make work project. Right, they killed a man who poisoned his entire family, wife and six kids the youngest was three months old. Look, I'm gonna say something that no former cop should ever say. Sounds like these two were doing the world a favor. They're murderers and cannibals. Your Jeffrey Dahmer type, huh? No, they need to eat human flesh to stop aging. And you really believe this? Of course I believe this. Look at this dump. You ever consider back on your meds? I've never been on meds. Ever considered getting meds? Fuck you, I'm not crazy, but I know who they are, and I know what they do, and I'm gonna prove it. Okay, okay, I believe you.

Teddy, it's almost 3:00 PM honey. I wanted to let you sleep, but I need your help. Just leave me alone. Come on, I made your favorite banana pancakes and bacon. Just don't bug me.

The therapists, psychiatrists, psychologists, social worker, that special camp for problem children. Yes, I remember. I even sent him to private school for two years. I couldn't afford it, but they said they'd had success with kids like Teddy. Doris, everyone knows you've done everything humanly possible for that boy. No, they don't. They think it's my fault. They think it's always the mother. That I didn't raise him right but I did, I did. I know, I know. Well, they don't, I can tell. I see the way they look at me. Half pity, half superiority. Well now. Well they do, they're damn perfect bloody children. Oh, I'm sorry. It's all right. But it's true. I mean, Jamie got into law school, and Diane was valedictorian. Brett had a football scholarship. And I have to get their damn Christmas letters every year with the minute details of their perfect children's perfect lives, makes me wanna scream. I can see how that would be very annoying for you, but Doris it's a long ways away from Christmas. So how would you tell me why you're here today? Oh dear, have you spoken to him about this? No, not yet. I was just so shocked and disappointed. He told me he was off drugs, that he just wanted to come home and help me with the motel. I don't know what possessed me to believe him. Would you like me to speak with him? I mean, I've known Teddy since he was little. He was the cutest sweetest little boy. I remember he used to work those big, beautiful, blue eyes of his, perhaps I can speak with him about addiction. No, you can't. Why not? Because he's gone again, just took off. Didn't even pack his things, he just left. I don't know why I'm surprised. It's his nature after all. Just fuck off you old bitch, and leave me the hell alone. Is Hope still here. No, she left early for work, why? I don't know. I don't know what to think about that girl. These damn socks, they have those little knots, always end up pinching my baby toes. You've barely eaten, what is it? It's not like it was. What on earth is? I mean, it doesn't work like it used to. You have to give it time. Honey it's like medicine, you have to give it time to feel the benefits. Not anymore, something's changed. Now you're just being silly. Nope, I can't do it anymore Harley. Of course you can. No, no, I can feel it in my bones. Oh, Edna. Hi. Hi. Can I help you with anything? Oh no, no, no, no, no. It's Hope right? Yes. I heard you're staying at the inn. Yes. Well, I can walk you home when you get off work, you know, just for safety sake the nights are really dark. Sure. Okay, great, great, great. I'll come pick you up when you get off work. What time? Nine. Nine, okay nine it is. I'll be back. Hey. Hey. Wanna go? You look nice tonight? Thank you. How was work? Good. Nice, nice. Oh hey, wait up. Thank you, goodnight. Wait. Goodnight. Goodnight. What is that crap anyway. It's Greek yogurt, walnuts and some blueberries. That's it, that's your dinner. Yes, I like it. Well, the rest of us had Brussels sprouts, mashed potatoes, roast and gravy. Good for you. Don't you ever miss it? No. Damn Hope you're gonna turn into one of those freaking vegans. So what if I do? Well it's not exactly the tradition around here now is it? I don't care. Well, you should. And what's with all this new religious crap? I know you've been sneaking off to that church. So it makes me feel better. How, do you go there to confess? You think it frees you from your past? Good luck. Our Father, who art in heaven, hallowed be Thy name. Thy Kingdom come. Thy will be done on earth as it is in heaven. Hey, here you are. Thank you, Jacob. How's it going? Jacob. Hey, Jacob how are you? Fine, fine. I haven't seen you in ages. How are your courses going? Okay, yeah. Art history, right? Yeah, yeah. And you're still enjoying them. Yeah. So how are your parents? Okay. And your sister how's she? Okay. And your little brother Tommy? He's okay.

Some people that find themselves in a crisis just need to unburden themselves. Some come looking for guidance and others just need an impartial ear to listen, until they can figure it out themselves. So Hope, you're new to town? Have you been able to make some friends? Well, I have one friend, but I'm a little confused. About? My feelings. Go on. He's really nice. He's kind, and sweet, and funny, and- - Cute? Is he cute? Yeah, I guess so. You really like this boy. Yes. That's great, I'm glad for you. But it makes me nervous. I'm always afraid something will go wrong. Hope that's only human nature. We're all worried to lose someone that we love. I didn't say that. You didn't have to. Just try and relax and let things play out naturally. Okay. Okay. I'm worried about Hope, Harley. Why is that? There's a boy, she's been sneaking him into the inn. I know that, nothing happens around here that I don't know about. Every night for the last two weeks. Well, doesn't it worry you? Why? Sex? You think they're having sex? I don't know, probably. I certainly hope so. Otherwise there's something wrong with them. Do you remember us at their age? We could barely keep our hands off of each other. Oh Harley. And as I remember it, you were magically beautiful. Harley, you're such a softy. No, this isn't about them having sex. That's not what worries me. What then? The talking Harley, the talking. Yeah, I had to take a motel room too bloody cold to stay in the trailer. Remind me never to move to Canada. No, nothing yet. And I just, everyone, I talk to says the same stuff. I know, that Smith was a slimy bastard, and if he was dead good riddance. No, you know the usual. Oh, it's such a peaceful, nice little town, nothing bad ever happens here, yada, yada yada. Yeah. Right, okay, I'll let you know. Hi. Hello, I brought you some towels and toiletry items. We don't get many visitors during the winter months. I'm just glad you were open. Well, I think there should always be some place for people to stay this time of year. I mean, the inn closes completely and there isn't another place for 30 miles. The inn? Yes, it's a lovely place. Big stone mansion at the edge of town. The owners used to have a farmer act as caretaker. Was his off season after all, but he fell last summer and broke his leg and yeah, he had to give it up. It's too bad. They have an older couple staying there now, you know, just to keep an eye on the place. People from town? No, I don't know them they're not from around here. Well, there's also a young woman staying there as well. I understand, enjoy your stay. Great, thank you very much. God damn. Jesus Christ it's him, it's fucking really him. Jesus. Miss, miss, hold on. I got to talk to you it's really important. Who are you? My name's Nate, I'm a private investigator. Look, the people you're staying with are not who you think they are, you're actually in a great deal of danger. Leave me alone. I know you think, they're a sweet old couple and that's what I used to think too, but they're not doing anything, but- - Go away you creep. But you gotta listen to me they kill people. Come anywhere near me again and I'll call the cops. But it's true. You're crazy. Oh shit she's right, I do sound crazy. Hope my goodness what is it? Please I just need someone to talk to. Has something happened? No, I'm just upset. I don't know what to do. Okay, okay. Just try and calm down okay, and tell me everything. Okay. Is it wrong not to warn someone of a possible danger? Someone who's been kind to you? What do you mean? What kind of danger? Is someone planning to hurt someone? No, not like that. The authorities are after this person. Oh, your young man has got himself into trouble? No, not him, But if I warn this person, everything will change. All of our lives will change just when I'm finally happy. I see. If your conscience demands, then tell this person, but Hope you are not obligated to do so, okay? If they've broken the law, then he or she is responsible for the outcome, not you, understand me. Okay. Okay. Breathe. Danny, I saw 'em. Harley Whalen in the flesh. What about the old lady? No, not her, not yet. You got to get up here fast I need your help. Okay, I'll be there as soon as I can, but don't do anything until I get there okay? All right, all right. Promise? Yeah, but I saw the girl. What girl? They got a girl living with them. Damn it Nate, what are you thinking? Why didn't you just wait? Somebody had to warn her and that somebody is me. Just stay put until I get there okay, shit. All right Danny, hurry up. Come on you fucker, what the fuck? Come on. Come on you... Finally. You're not normal. You don't fit in and do you? You don't have time for me anymore? It used to be just you and me, now there's this boyfriend. Don't you care about me anymore? And what's with all this religious crap? Are you confessing? How could you? You think that will save you? Fat chance, nothing can save you. You deserve what you've got coming. Traitor, traitor, traitor. Hey, hey, hey, what is it, what is it, are you okay? Nothing, it's nothing, I just had a really bad day. What happened, you can talk to me. Oh Jacob. Happy birthday. Jacob, it's not my birthday. I know, I just thought I'd take a chance, it could have been. What did you do? I didn't know what you like so I bought a few things I just didn't expect you to be so sad.

This is Nathan Field, please leave a message and I'll get back to you as soon as possible. Pickup for Christ's sake Nate, just call me would you? What is it Harley? Oh it's nothing. Seems like something to me. Someone's got you're squirming around like that. I think it's toilet paper. They just don't make it the way they used to. How so? Well, it's not the same. It makes me all itchy and uncomfortable. Haven't you noticed? I can't say that I have. It's like it crumbles and it's like, it leaves crumbs behind, it's miserable stuff. Anything else you'd like to get off your chest Harley? Anything particularly bother you? Toenails. What's wrong with toenails? Two things actually. They grow too fast and they're hard to get to, a body can't keep up. I see. Howsomeever, it's over Harley. No, don't say that. I know it. I can feel it, but not for you. You're not done yet, I can tell. Oh Edna, I can't go on without you. You've got to have hope, Harley. No, no I can't. Yes you can. You've got to carry on. We all do what we have to do. I'm awfully tired, Harley. Do you think you could help me get upstairs? Oh, of course dear. I think I'd like to rest a while? Maybe just sit in my chair by the window. Sure, come on. You better let me carry you. That's just what you need. I'll get you into something warm and cozy, a good rest and you'll be feeling right as rain. I must admit I had a soft spot for this girl. Maybe it's because so many of our young people had drifted away. She seemed so lost and vulnerable. She had this innocence about her that made me want to comfort her and reassure her that, whatever her problem, everything would be all right. Hope, come in. Are you feeling better today? I suppose so. So have you come to a decision about your dilemma? Yes. It is a terrible situation to be in, to have to betray the trust of a loved one. But remember you did not create the situation that put this person in jeopardy, they did that to themselves. So may I ask, have you decided to warn this person about the authorities, I'm assuming the police? Yes, yes I have. Oh, you have. You don't approve. It was your decision to make I am not here to judge. Really? 'Cause the church is kind of famous for that. Hope. Isn't it judgment and then guilt, lots and lots of guilt. What an earth has gotten into you? The church judges people for every little thing that goes on in their lives, and then shovels on the guilt, heaps of it. Hope please. And the sins, lots and lots of sins. Some of them are even considered deadly, even gluttony for fucks sake like you've never overeaten on occasion. You're out of line Hope. I know what the church thinks about people who steal, and covet, and blaspheme. And I know what the church thinks about people who kill people. For God's sake. So what would the church think about people who kill people and then eat them. Live by the cross, die by the cross. Isn't that what they say church lady? Close enough. Oh, and by the way, I'm not Hope. Hey. Hi. I really enjoyed seeing you last night. You did? Yeah, you wanna go for a walk or something? Sure, I'd like that. Yeah I know, kinda tough trail. So, have you ever seen the chapel? No, I've always been curious about it though it's funny. Lived here all my life never seen it. Well, I guess it's time then, isn't it? It's like a jail cell. Exactly. Oh, it's beautiful. I love the stained glass windows. That's the coronation when Jesus crowns Mary, makes her queen of heaven and... Oh yeah, that's the annunciation. That's when the Angel Gabriel tells the Virgin Mary that she going to conceive the Christ child, and that one, that one depicts the agony in the garden. It's when Jesus realizes he's gonna be betrayed. You suppose I could take a couple pictures just for class and oh, what a beautiful altar. - Here again? - What's the problem? I'd like a little time to myself is all, is a little privacy too much to ask? Privacy? Come on, you know you can never hide anything from me. I'm not hiding anything. You sure? What do you mean by that? What do you mean by that? I know you plan on ratting out the old ones. Imagine that after all they've done for us. I would never. Don't bother pretending otherwise. You didn't really think I'd let that go unpunished, did you? By the way, I met your little boyfriend. By the way, I met your little boyfriend. When? Today here, he came looking for you. He was very sweet really, incredibly innocent and trusting. Yeah, I took him to see the chapel. He thought it was beautiful. Kept going on and on about the stained glass and religious symbolism, the nativity scene, and the resurrection, and that one panel where Jesus meets his mother while he's carrying the cross, so sad. I think your little boyfriend was genuinely moved, but he found the altar particularly interesting. No No, no. It never would have worked you know. Imagine what your little Romeo would have thought when he found out what you really are. It was amusing though. You thinking you're some kind of modern day Juliet. You deserve this Hope Bertha. Joy Beulah Whalen, you bitch. I loved him. I got you now, feeding time's over, oh yeah, time's up old timer. I've found you, you fuck. Okay kiddies, it's dinner time. You can wander the grounds if you like, but the inn's closed for the season. There's no room or food, if that's what you're after. I just wanted to take a look around. I heard a lot about the inn. You We never had a moment of peace because of you, always running. And my Edna I'll kill you. You son of a bitch. No. I didn't mean for this to happen it's not my fault, it was an accident, he attacked to me. No. Look, you're lucky I came when I did. You don't understand. He was probably planning to kill you because that's what he does. He was my father. Hey Lucy. Hi Frank How are you doing? Good, how are you? Good, hungry. Hungry? What are you thinking? Well, what am I gonna do first is, put my feet up, crack a few beers and watch the game. Sounds good. 'Cause I've actually got money riding on it. Oh my, isn't that illegal. Shh, don't tell anyone. Well, I am all in of those meals that you really like, but I do have pizza in the cooler over there. No, you don't have any of the frozen ones? Unfortunately no, I'm sorry, it sold out earlier. All right. Wine, pizza's always good. Yes it is pizza and beer. Pizza and beer. You can't have pizza without beer. There's some in the bottom of the cooler over there. How's that a wife of yours. She's good, and I'm happy now. Nice. Speaking of wife, you know how much she loves these peanut butter things. Sounds good, I'll take two. All right, I got two here. One of those. Gonna get fat over here. So how's your shift going are you done? Yep, you bet and I'm heading home. That's what the beers are for. You have a good night? Yeah, it's been busy. Like I said, we sold out earlier. So can't complain, there you go, sir. Right on sweetie okay, George better watch out that I don't steal you away. Yeah, yeah. Oh, I forgot to ring you up. I'll catch you tomorrow. Yeah, I know where you live. Frank here. Hi Frank, I need you to check something out I just got a call from a cop no less. You're kidding. The guy's really upset. He can't reach his friend, name is Nate Field. I was just heading home. He's staying out at the motel. Can you just stop by? Okay, okay, I'll check it out. Everything okay? Yeah, everything's fine. No rest for the wicked. I'll see you tomorrow. Drive safe. Thank you. My word, Frank, what are you doing out there? I'm looking for a man named Nate Field, he took a room here, right? Yes, he's down at number four is something wrong? Nah, you know how it is? A friend of his wasn't able to reach him and started to worry. His cell probably died or something. Actually, I haven't seen him since he got here. He was asking about the inn though, if that's any help. Good, thanks Doris. Okay. They said you'd help me, that if I was good and prayed, you'd show me a way out. And I did, I prayed all the time, but you didn't help me. And now I've lost everyone. I thought you could save me, but it's true, nothing can save me. Police, I need to speak with someone. Hello, anyone? Hello? Hello, anyone? Call Stone Town Police. Stone Town Police Department. Yeah, hi it's Dan Davis. It's been three hours any word? We sent a car out Mr. Davis, but the officer hasn't called back in yet. So that's it I mean can't you send someone else. There are only three of us. Mr. Davis. It's just a small town. Fuck. I'm looking for a friend of mine, Nate Field, he was staying here. Oh yes, there was a policemen from town here earlier asking about him. Oh good. I told Frank that your friend seemed interested in the old inn, so I think he was heading over there. Thanks, whereabouts would I go? Oh, just down the hill, turn right, follow the road right along the river, you can't miss it, it's big iron gates at the entrance. Big help, thanks very much. Hello, Nate. Hello? Hello Nate? Hey, I'm sorry man, stuck in traffic. I got here as quick as I could. You up here? Hello? Hello? Anyone in there? Hello? Anybody there? Wally, got to be kidding me.
