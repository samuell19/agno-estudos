- Fourth, I am the Eighth. Women left the house. How do you understand? - Eighth, I am the Fourth, I understand you. If women break up, accompany each individually. I am the Fourth, I understand you. Accompany separately. - Already the end of the year, you need to tighten the math. - Oh mom, I beg you. I’m just doing this. “So you're not doing it enough.” Okay, I ran. After school, go straight home. Correct the cloak. - Come on. - Go home ... - Well, mom! - After school, right home, understand? And sit down to do. So, please go to the store and buy milk. So, here you have the money - twenty ruble. Enough. - Fourth, I am the Eighth. Women diverge. - Covering my mother. The ninth follows the daughter. - I understand you. Follow up. - Fourth, I'm the Seventh. Fourth, I am the Seventh. The ninth accompanies. Goes by the yards. When going out, the utmost attention. The utmost attention! Connect the fifth and reserve. - Come here please. That's her? “Now you understand what you have done?” Where is he? - I do not know. I do not know! On my first visit I lived for two days. Oh! - Where is he? - I do not know! Said he left a notebook - in the office at ... - What next? - We went with him. I opened everything with him. I disabled the alarm. - How did you turn it off? - I called the remote control, she said she left a bag of groceries. They all know me there. Well, did I know that he took these stones! And Nina. - You scum! You scum, here you are. If you told me about it, Krotova would be alive. - Oh oh! (Command in German) (commands in German) - Solemnly. - We have this ritual every Wednesday in memory of the citizens of fascism and militarism. - Yes I understand. (foreign language) - Dmitry Ivanovich told me, that you are now busy with some very interesting business. It’s too early to say or ... - We used to say so in Odessa: "Let's go, or .." You Germans also often use the word "oder" at the end of a phrase. Translated into Russian, it means "Or", yes? Yes. It is as if you are leaving your interlocutor an extra chance for an answer. - Do you know German? - Yes. With dictionary. If you have such a tricky wording when filling out the questionnaire. Koda man knows two German words “Berlin” and “Guten so”, he writes - read with a dictionary. - Ha ha ha. - You see, Paul, the thing we are trying to promote not quite ordinary. Do you know how a wolf cuts a herd? He runs blindly, tearing the throat to all who stands in the way. This man is a wolf. Even worse. - Guten like that - Guten like that. - This is from the criminal department. On charges of Nikolai Ivanovich Krotova, born in 1923, cohabiting with imperial citizen Greta Pickedans, with nee Orenberg. 1885 year birth please. Under Hitler, all exported from their homeland Slavs French, Dutch gave subscription that will not cohabit with German women. It was forbidden by racial laws. Hitler. Liquefaction of Oryol blood was punished imprisonment in a concentration camp. Cleverly. And especially listen carefully Krotov’s explanations. I even made a translation for you. - Danke, Paul. - "I, Nikolai Ivanovich Krotov, repeatedly encouraged for implementation special tasks behind the Bolsheviks, forced to state that guilty of the charge I don’t admit myself. Greta Pickedans was not in close relationship with me, she just rented a room in her house. The impossibility of our close relationship due to the fact that I gave a non-cohabitation subscription with women of the highest race. With this Frau Pickedans 38 years older than me. "-" She decided that I went down to her jewelry store from the second floor where I rented a room, to rob her. And I, in fact, only examined the jewels because in Russia, never seen gold or stones. " He’s lying. They also lied. His ancestors had jewelry trade in Smolensk. “Nevertheless, he was given three years of hard labor.” Here is the help about transporting Krotov to a concentration camp. These are documents for his recruitment into the SD services. These are four reports of the ESS Sturmbanführer. Here is a job report and a list underground members executed by his denunciations: Russians Ukrainians, Serbs, Poles. Note on assigning the new agent the nickname Krotik. - And what kind of documents? - And these are materials to a certain Ernest Lebedev. Krotov was in his unit. They were dumped together in the Batumi region. This is what is written in the instructions of the Gestapo about this unit. "Diversion in the deep behind enemy lines, stocks terror behind enemy lines, successfully completing such tasks careful preparation must precede in the following areas: harboring skills, organization of spare turnout, work with documents, the science of getting in touch with people, development of behaviors Legend of fate, character, skills. Saboteur should not stand out and others. Appearance must be average habitual. Any kind of special signs somehow memorable walk tick or stutter do not allow use face in work in case these defects cannot be dramatically curable. - What did stuttering really cure there? - Yes, in special school 51 B. Treated, experimented. There are documents I used them when I was writing a doctoral thesis. “Can you get these documents?” - Yes, it's over. This is also very curious. Take a look. "In the case of the alleged act of terrorism saboteur must be able make adjustments to the preliminary plan, find out a single place where will it be held an act with communication lines, counting not only on trams, buses, railways, ports and airfields, but also an opportunity use of attics, basements, underground utilities. For this person admitted to school second - stage. "- Is this the second stage waiting? “Well, yes, something similar.” "Must practice tactics, instantly to shoot. Chronometrically accurately measure routes leaving the place of the act, having pre-purchased tickets for transport. Rehearsed several times, not trusting a colleague, but only a chronometer whole act process from start to finish. " - Tell me, Paul, but for lawyers from other countries, in particular for a federal lawyer republic of Germany, these denunciations of Krotov can serve as evidence of guilt? Do they allow him to be considered a war criminal? - This question is extremely complicated, Vladislav. Bonnie requires compelling evidence. - I.e? Well, are Krotik's denunciations not evidence? - You may be objected that he was so forced to act. Under the pressure of circumstances. - He personally did not hang? - Not. - He reported, well, bad of course, shame. But who signed the orders, Krotik or some Standartenführer. And he was already sitting in the late 40s ready. Now he is writing memoirs. - Vladislav Nikolaevich, report. - Please forgive some of my dispersion. I'm straight from the plane. So, right on the points. The first one. Krotov, who killed Milenko, now there is no doubt about it trained in diversionary sniper shooting skills, the ability to break away from surveillance, the basics of makeup, making fake documents, organization in the forest, etc. etc. The second one. I believe that we should establish surveillance immediately behind Milenko’s mother’s house. If Krotov by going border, will ask for political asylum, and he should ask him, like Milenko, not Krotov, then, according to his logic, not a single witness should remain from those who would identify the criminal who killed true Gregory Milenko, from the village of Kryukovo, The remaining area. - Surveillance established. After our puncture yes, a puncture in Smolensk, we quickly blocked the house Narcisov, Lviv, and the sister of Krotov. - It seems to me that one of our many mistakes was that we still set time as the main factor. We believed and fair suggested that Krotov should immediately and as quickly as possible disappear from the scene of the crime. In this case, I'm talking about Smolensk. His call from Adler to the murdered Krotova fits into the system of this judgment. Krotov outplayed us. He followed a paradoxical path. "And they, that is, we, go like hounds on swoops and I will trample Krotov. " And they will overtake me. "And he beat us. Suggestions. Major Kardava with his group block the Black Sea region coasts, especially Sukhumi and Batumi. Krotov knows them since childhood. Kardava installs at airfields posts, maintains constant contact with security officers. Together with them they will prepare a capture or interception operation. Kuznetsova, please connect the police department by air transport. Yes. I consider it necessary to ask management to highlight task forces also in those fishing farms from where ships leave for the ocean without calling at foreign ports. - Seleznev is your group. - Moles, hiring a ship can take this opportunity to go abroad. - I have already contacted the KGB, security officers suggested holding a joint meeting with border guards. They promised to help us. Well, if all the same - he has already gone? - In that case it’s necessary connect a specialist in international law. - It is necessary to draw up a system of evidence Krotov's guilt, and given the legal proceedings of Germany and other western countries. - A evidence-based analysis for them, which did Major Kardava working in the archives, about the battle for glory, about the atrocities of traitors, working with the Gestapo? - For them, he is little evidence, and for us it is evidence, because twenty million Milenko lie in the ground. I will consult on this issue. I think we’ve been all this time suffered a very serious flaw were passive, followed the criminal. And we had to try to make sure that we he was led, forced him to such an action that benefits us and is controlled by us. Niels Bohr said, "The idea is - brilliant only if she suffers from some kind of crazy woman. " This is what we all need to think about. - Here is everything that we have collected in the Krotov case. - Yes, we have a wonderful job. - None of us have ever seen a client alive, and we already know so much about him. - Do you think something will be added? “But the devil knows him.” When are you flying away? How is the weather in your Caucasus? - Tomorrow. We are always good. But this is not the main thing. The main thing is i concealed goodbye Vladislav Nikolaevich. I found Lebedev. - What Lebedev? - Lebedev, who threw himself to us with Krotov. He served his 15 years and now lives, where do you think? - In Sukhumi. “Young man, really.” Right Near Sukhumi. - Ernest Vasilievich! Will we raise the second boat? - No, let it stand still. - Well then, I went to smoke then. - Are you Lebedev? - Yes. - Who are you? - Colonel Kostenko. - GB CHK? - Criminal investigation. - It's strange. And I am not your client. - With what have you come? - having a conversation - No protocol? - Without. - No, thank you. I don’t speak with people of your profession without a protocol. “As you know, I will call the stenographer.” He will fix our conversation. - And I'm used to giving hand-made testimony. - Then we will not call the stenographer. The first question will probably surprise you a little. - And surprise is the only pleasure, which I have left in life. I am listening to you. “You give up this manner of yours, okay?” You, and your gang, killed my father, and killed your brother, and your sister starved to death, so don't clown around. - Don’t scare me, citizen colonel. I’m familiar with these passes. - I do not scare, I remind. And enough words, I have little time. - But I have a lot. “So you can tell me a lot.” - Yes, a novel and two stories. - Do you know Lebedev, why are you always on the fly? - Well, who is this evil conceals to me? - Moles. - And who is it? - Do not know? “God kill me, I don’t know.” - Do not touch God. Do not. This is a copy of the interrogation taken from you. in May 45th in the death of the first Belarusian front. After all, you are then only with your own hands, is not it so? Want to make sure? - I'm without glasses. Do not take the trouble to read aloud. - I will not consider it. "About whom else am I mine ..." Question. "About whom else from Former employees, consider it necessary to inform the investigation, having in view of the measure of their public danger? "Answer. "I ask the investigation to pay attention to the wanted list following persons like inveterate enemies of the Soviet authorities who came under Hitler’s banners not under duress like me, but for ideological reasons. The first I want to call Salerova Fadeya, 25 years old originally from Tambov, father, as he spoke before the revolution, served in the prosecutor's office, then he was convicted, returned and worked in the dining room system. Salerov was my first leader in the reconnaissance group "Вальт". The second in danger, I must name Krotika. "That is Krotova. So? "Unlike me, taken prisoner in an unconscious state, then by torture by hunger brought to despair, and agreed to go over it at the service of the worst enemies of our heroic people, he, Krotik brought in the arms of a wounded Komsomol by the name of Kozel. And tablet with cards and documents and thus earned the confidence of the Nazi occupiers. After casting Krotik was awarded the Iron Cross in the Batumi region. In 1943 he was arrested by a criminal by the police because after completing the next task entered into cohabitation with the widow of a jeweler and wanted to kidnap her. jewelry. However, unlike other arrested for this kind of crime he was released and moved to another group with a raise. " Want to make sure? I will wait while you go for points. - He also served? - Not. In there at the school of Gehlen, makeup was studied Everyone studied individually, or all together? - I don’t remember, it seems like a cop. - How did you make up? - The teachers did not advise me - use paint. - And Krotov? “Like when.” Shaved his head naked. He grew a beard, a mustache. I do not remember. - How did he behave in critical situations? Hot? - The reaction is instant - stab with a knife or shot from a pistol. - Was he very strong? - Incredible. - One characteristic, inherent only to him, remember? - Well no, in other matters, he always tried to be gray, inconspicuous. - Did he stutter? - Not. But he spoke slowly. - Me that interests, if he, Krotov, decides to leave the cordon, which way will go? By air or water? “Do you really cross these boundaries?” - It's right. You can’t cross our borders. But he can inherit blood in such an attempt. - Probably would go with water. He swam superbly, and could stay on the water for a long time. - What water temperature? - sixteen. For him, it’s the same as fresh milk. - Krotov is fussing. After him three murders, he removes the witnesses. Here is his work. A woman who is lying on the street is his relative. But as soon as he felt the danger felt, I emphasize. He removed it. If he finds out, and he will definitely check it out, you are in line. If Krotov replenish your biography with new information - you have not caught it yet. - Catch. And you will help us. You will have protection, in case Krotov comes to you. I guarantee it to you. If he calls you on the phone, hold him as long as possible. Will require a meeting - agree. In your position, the lesser of two evils is chosen. That's all. You have no choice. It turns out you are our client. As you deigned to put it. I repeat, you have no other choice. “You can always find a way out.” Trust me. - Diana Savelievna, but I did come for the nugget that you left October 16 last year, Mikhail Konchikov. (singing the song "Grass by the House") - Rescue station. - I need Lebedev, You could not call him in to the phone. - We’ll look now. Ernest Vasilievich, you are on the phone. - Lebedev by the phone. - Are you listening? - Lebedev is listening, who is talking? - Your colleague in Batumi, - remember? - I do not understand. - I say it again: your colleague. Are you calm? I ask: do you live calmly? - Calm down. “What time are you saving?” - In terms of work? Before sunset. - That's what. I need you. I’m waiting for you at the market tomorrow at 12 o’clock, I’ll drop the envelope in the mailbox and they will finally find out about you what only I know, understand? - When do you "tower"?

Or is there a place like that allowed there. Lined up. This came, this Shliftitsky came. And these Germans. They talked with a translator, and these shouted, we just shouted "Zig, Zig, Zig." That's all. - Be equal! Attention! The police officer must always remember that he stands on an important site the common front of the new Europe. Our vigilance, courage and ruthlessness to enemies manifested in illegality in relation to to the civilian population, - Finishing Krotov’s case, I looked hundreds of meters German chronicle. And our television materials about the liquidation processes. And so I caught myself on that That I’m no longer looking for accomplices of Krotov, and Lebedev, but just peering at these faces. And painfully trying to understand how could this happen to people. How to tear your fate from the fate of his people. And continue to live. And I can’t understand. - Vladislav Nikolaevich, we still have movie footage. Will you watch? - No, thanks, I've seen enough. So maybe just delete them from memory? Spit and grind. Finally.
