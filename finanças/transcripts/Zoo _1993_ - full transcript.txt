(child exclaiming) - Dad, if you want to take a picture, don't take a picture of this thing when he's buckin' me. (children exclaiming) (birds calling) (flamingos honking) (birds calling) - Can you help me find? - What? - [Child] I know where the alligators are. (birds calling) (flamingos honking) (crowds muttering) (birds calling) - [Visitor] Look at him! (laughing) - [Visitor] See, now you don't have your burlap. Is it warmin' up? - They're eating bananas. They're eating bananas. I thought it was just a myth that they liked bananas. (children exclaiming) (radio instructing) (children shouting) - [Visitor] Are you gonna swing some? - [Child Visitor] Maybe that's the mother and that's the baby? - [Visitor] They went over to their father now. (visitor speaking foreign language) - She looks like monkey. - Right there. - Oh, look at him! - Now, where's that old one? I see the other one. - [Child] Where, which one? (children exclaiming) - [Radio] They're on break right now, two o'clock to three o'clock. (radio responding) - [Radio] That's a negative, it'll be tomorrow morning. - [Radio] Yes, are they going there? - [Radio] No, stop by, we'll take Brotas. - They're walking back? - Yeah. Show me where that post is. - The Bengal in back. - [Cameraman] Can see the Bengal on one side? - [Crew] Yeah, let's set the Bengal in the shot. - Harry? - Keep the dingle going. - [Crew] Where are they? - [Cameraman] So you stay there, I'll be a bit closer on it. Let's get some dingle in the shot. Just keep the ding still. Good. Just keep the dingle still. Keep it still. (crowd muttering) (birds chirping) (birds calling) - Where are the dead animals? - The animals are inside. (crowd muttering) (birds honking) (birds calling) (birds honking) (engine humming) (cart braking) - Hey, Rose, Hey, Rose. (cage clanging) (chimpanzees screaming) (chimpanzees hooting) (cage clanging) - Fine, yes! (laughing) Be nice, Abby! (chimpanzees hooting) (trainer hooting) (chimpanzees hooting) Good girl! (laughing) (chimpanzee screaming) Hey, Abby! What are you doin'? You're startin' another fight, aren't ya? Stop it. Stop it. Okay, Rebecca. (chimpanzee honking) No, no, that's a good girl. (cage clanging) (chimpanzees hooting) Oh, stop it! Come here, Miss Rebecca. Watch out, watch out! I saw that mouth full of water, Abby! (trainer laughing) (cage clanging) Do you want some more? (trainer laughing) You're full of it, man. How do you guys put up with her? How can you live with an animal like that? Huh, how can you? Oh, did she pick on the baby? Rosebud, don't let her do that to your kid, she's a pain. You guys need to discipline her a little bit. Oh, baby! (laughing) - Move up, come on. Come on, Moj. Come on, Mary. Come on. - [Visitor] Checkin' out the gardens. Look it, look it. (laughing) - [Visitor] Hi! (visitor speaking foreign language) (gorilla pounding) (visitors speaking foreign language) (visitor yelling) (gorilla pounding) (visitors laughing) - [Visitor] Yeah, 350 to six. (visitors speaking foreign language) - Oh, yeah, I would say myself, they say chimpanzees are closer related to human beings than they are related to gorillas. So, we're the closest relation to your chimpanzees, and especially the pygmy chimpanzees, which is known as a bonobo. They're highly intelligent, and if you just watch a group of chimpanzees in a zoo and compare them to what a bunch of gorillas would do, the chimps are more gregarious, they're laughing, they're trying to do more in like the human being because they're mimicking us. Gorillas are laid back, they're just introverted, they could care less. (laughing) and, of course, you know the gorilla in California, Coco, that Francine Patterson is studying? She's taught them sign language and of course the chimps know sign language, but she's been with this gorilla for about 16 years. And what she wanted to do was teach the gorilla sign language, hopefully breed with another gorilla, and what they wanted to do was see was if they would teach their offspring sign language? But, unfortunately, they haven't bred. But it would be interesting to see if they did teach their young because they sign to them, they speak to them and everything they do is sign or the spoken word. And they've actually seen gorillas looking at picture books and signing to themselves the pictures they see in a book. - They may survive. - Huh? - They may survive. - Yeah. (laughing) - Thank you. - You're welcome. - Excuse me, but do you know where I can get some more of these cards? - I have a snake which is the one you already... Wait, maybe I have, yes, I do have another one in the back. Okay? - Oh wow, what do you say? - Thank you! - You're very welcome. You're very welcome, okay? - [Visitor] We're gonna watch them. (whistling) That's a rhino. - No! - That's not a rhino? - That's a baby, look at this. - (laughing) Like this! Come here, you can't believe this! - [Visitor] Look at it's ears! (laughing) - Look, when he was laying on his back and then his ears were his hands, like this. (laughing) - Wow, look, Annie, look, look at that! That's not a rhino. Well, it sure is. That's another one over there, I think? - No, it's a rock. - Is that a rock? That sure isn't a rock, look at the ears. See, he's in the water. See? (children exclaiming) - Silly rhino. (visitors speaking foreign language) - [Child] He's got hair on his ears. He's got hair on his ears. - He's 5,000 pounds. - Wow! - [Visitor] Doesn't the skin look like armor? - [Daddy] See him shake, Alicia? - He doesn't shake, Daddy. - He doesn't? - [Child] He just. (woman laughing) - [Child] Alicia. - [Radio] Zoo one, zoo thirty. - Zoo one, we have a situation starting over here. We're not exactly sure what the timing is but I've gone ahead and barricaded the service road starting at the intersection behind Asian Rhino, all the way to the east side of Otter just to make sure. It does seem that she has started early labor. - [Radio] Okay. (zookeepers muttering) (Bill sighing) - [Zookeeper] Didn't seem round. (crickets chirping) (rhino panting) (rhino panting) (rhino panting) (crickets chirping) (rhino panting) - [Dr. Miller] Wait. - Here. - [Zookeeper] Not carrying that baby no more. (zookeepers slapping) - [Dr. Miller] Here you go. Is she okay? - Yeah, we're watching her. - Come on. Come on and try it. (slapping) Come up for a minute. Come on, then. Put her back down. - [Bill] It's a girl, isn't it? Little girl. A little girl, Alice. - There's something to give for it, but I don't know if it could do that much. Pull up some more do-creme, just grab the tartrazine. Let me see that syringe. - [Bill] I don't have another one, Sharon. - Come on, babe. Come on. Come on, blow it out your nose, come on. - Yeah. - Give it to her. - Where? - Just stuff it in her muscle. - [Zookeeper] No, where's the stuff? - Oh, it's in the top of the box. Come on, big breath now. Forget it. - [Bill] Call it. - [Zookeeper] 26 minutes. - Her little ears not touching it, then, I mean, I was right on her glas and sticking my finger in it and she wasn't even paying attention. (sighing) Johnny, put her placenta in one of these. Get on with the night. Was a girl? - Yes. You think she died 'cause she was in there too long? - Probably, can't see anything else wrong with her. She come out nose first? - Yeah. (Bill sighing) - Did you see any moving that whole time? I kinda figured it was gone. - [Zookeeper] The bag opened up and it was clean right from the beginning but there was just nothin'. (animals sounding) - Crew in? - Yeah, so far, Bill. No one's called in, everything looks fine. Getting ready to head out. - [Radio] Jess out. (zookeeper whistling) - How's the new baby doing? Okay, good girl. How we doin', huh? How we doin'? Doin' okay, yeah. How you doin'? Hi, guys, hey, guys. How's your eye doin', huh? It looks better than yesterday. (whistling) Eustace! (door pounding) (whistling) Hey, Eustace, good morning! You awake? Move your ears, that a boy. Good boy! Hey, Shawnie! How you feeling this morning, girl? Hey, Shawnie, hey! Relax! (rhino grunting) That's a good girl. How ya doin', huh? Can I see, can I see? Turn around, you're okay. Let me find ya somethin' to eat here. That a girl, good girl. Here, here you go, want that? Want that, here. Don't be so mad, I just wanna look. I want to see how your feelin'. You've been through a lot lately, haven't ya? Here ya go, come down here. Come down here, huh? You're not gonna turn around? Not gonna turn around for me, huh? That's a good girl, good girl. Feelin' better, feelin' better? I know. It was rough, huh? Maybe next time. (birds calling) (visitors exclaiming) (driver instructing) (elephant grunting) - [Zookeeper] Good job. Good job. Down. Good boy. Go down. Good boy, good boy. Yeah. Good boy. Mary - Come on, Moju. Jack, move up, come here. Move up. - Ronnie! - [Zookeeper] Jackson, here. - [Zookeeper] Mary. What was it? Mary, Mary, move up. - Move up, Flora, come on. Come here, Ronnie. Come here, Ronnie, move up! Move up, Jack, good boy. Move up! Come here, Ronnie. Come here. Move up. Move up. - Go ahead and see if you can't move it up so we can get a shoulder on her. If not, I'll at least have her when she goes in the water. Widen the hoop up and see if we can't move back a little bit further, I just don't... She's really depressed, her muscle tone's bad. I just don't want to get her neck by itself if we can help it. There you go, beautiful. Gonna need more, so keep it goin'. Alright, take your boot and lift that foot up. Oh, wait a minute, get that piece of king grass out of the way. Have it right here, where the rope is against it. See it here. - Tryin' to see which line. - [Bill] This king grass right there, see, knock it out from under her, see. - [Tom] Watch your support, I'm pullin' it. - Lift that foot up, just lift the foot up. Okay. I'm gonna bring her over that way, so get the other rope on her. Okay, bring the other rope. - Oh, sorry, Mark. - Come around on this side of me, first, Tom. I'm gonna let her float. Let her roll. Okay. Ready? Let her wrap if she wants to wrap. Hold on, hold on. - [Zookeeper] You can take her nose. - Now, strike. - Back off. - There you go. - You got her? - Lift it. - There you go. Don't, don't do that, okay. Martha, hang on tight to her. - I got her. - Got her? - Yep. - Alright, Tom, you ready? Don't do that to me. Hold it. Blind her. You can tilt the angle a little better. Alright, go ahead and start to pull her in. Keep going. - Okay. - Alright. - She's in here. Just throw the whole rope in with her. - Or do you just want to have this half-locked? - You can just throw it in there. We can go out either way. Okay. Tom, you and I, let's get right in the middle. Right here in the center. Ready? - Ready. Ah, what I want to do is just pull her out enough to get her head. Good enough, leave that on her. Move that out of the way. - [Zookeeper] Don't back up, girl. (laughing) - [Zookeeper] I'm gonna touch her in the back here, so... - [Bill] Okay. - [Zookeeper] Lift him up. (apes grunting) - [Dr. Brindle] Good fella. - [Dr. Miller] How about one of those Betadine block things that I put in? Okay. - Okay? - [Zookeeper] Keep that end. - Okay. - Okay. - [Dr. Miller] Whoa, ,whoa, whoa! We just pulled the catheter. Lift it up. Is it still running or is it pulled? Probably pulled. On to the x-ray table, please. - You guys ready? - Yes. - Head that way, please. - Okay. - Load him up. - Yeah. When she gets in the-- - Yes, ma'am. Alright? - [Dr. Miller] Okay, let's hang it on the machine. - [Dr. Brindle] It's a little lighter than it should be. She's dropped 50 pounds since she came in to us. - [Veterinarian] Okay, it's doing a self-check, it just has to sit for a half-sec. And all you have to do is plug it in and you're all set, you don't have to do anything to it, it's all automated. - Okay. We'll see if we can borrow somebody else's uniform. Okay, right around here. I got it. (workers muttering) Oh, I hate doing this to him, poor thing. - [Dr. Brindle] Left arm. - [Dr. Miller] Yeah, we're gonna not quite reach that vein there. - [Zookeeper] You got plenty of opening here. - [Dr. Miller] It's a good color. You alright? I was going to say, don't lift his head up. Nope, you're doin' alright, just keep the light where it is. You happy right now, Dr. Brindle? With him? - As interesting as it is to see a gorilla go through a physical, zoo officials want to do more than just pique public curiosity. They hope that through education, efforts will be made to save this species' nearly extinct wild cousin, the mountain gorilla. As interesting as it is to see a gorilla go through a physical, zoo officials want to do more than just pique public curiosity. They hope that through education, efforts will be made to save this species', uh. - [Cameraman] Three, two, one. - As interesting as it is to see a gorilla go through a physical, zoo officials want to do more than just pique public curiosity. They hope that through education, efforts will be made to save this species' nearly extinct wild cousin, the mountain gorilla. - That's two good endings. - Okay. Do you want to do a tease, or do you want to uh? - Let's do a tease. - Same thing, or? - Yeah, same thing. - Okay. A physical fit for a gorilla. I'm Kathleen Corso with that story on the Earth Watch. Problem? Okay, three, two, one. A physical fit for a gorilla. I'm Kathleen Corso with that story on the Earth Watch. - Come on. Come on, Dave. Come on, Dave. Come on, Dave! (keys jingling) Come on! Come on. Come on, come on. - Hi, this Dr. Miller, we had a stillborn, term female, Indian Rhino last night and I'm getting ready to do her necropsy. And I'm trying to figure out who gets what tissues, and I understand you're interested in reproductive tracts. Are you interested in one from a neonate? What do you want it, in formalin? Just the entire tract? Okay, we'll try and save that for ya. Yeah, that's... Ideas? Yeah, it was just a dystocia, she took a real long time in doin' it. It came normal presentation, but it took hours and hours and I think the kid just couldn't take it any longer. So. I haven't seen the male, she was bred out at Philadelphia. And it's not a particularly huge kid, but she's an older mother and it's her first kid. Like I said, everything seemed to be going normal, except it took her a very, very, very long time to deliver it. She started at about 12:30 in the afternoon. We saw, what looked like water breaking probably around five or six, I guess, for sure. We weren't sure if she was urinating or drippin' water before then. About 8:30, she started gettin' down and really concentrating on straining and she delivered it at 10:15. (radio calling) She's 96 pounds, so, you wanna take the back end, I'll take the front end. I'll have to take care of the rest of this stuff later. - [Zookeeper] Now I'm gonna wait until the cart for us... It's still on the frontage road. - There's nothing wrong with it, she just strained. Yeah, just leave her in there for now. There's no place to put her in the shade. You have a tarp or somethin'? Bill, I was gonna say, wait 'til I lay it all out, and then I'll give you an overview, with the kid next to it. I'm gonna stick it in there. That's the horn the baby was in, that's the other one. Head down. Here, you take the back end. Position her. Yeah, I think it was just too long a birth. I think if you get the whole thing, so that you can include that. Kid was inside, in here. Inside a separate bag, which is the amnion, in here. Wherever it went, there, inside the amnion, inside the placenta. I want to do that skin biopsy. You know, I don't know what other things you want to document? As far as a full picture of her face before we cut anything, or not? - Yeah, I got one this way, but I'd like to do. With the ears open. - Let's see if I can make her roll up this ear. Prop them for you a little bit. Nah, they won't prop forward. Okay, we'll take a couple samples in each one of these. This is the one the kid was in. Okay, a couple more scrubs. - Probably the only bony part of it that would be worth savin' it. Even with it this young, it would be nice for a chunk of hide. The hide is small enough, depending on. - I think we can do that. (workers muttering) (radio responding) Jackie, are you kinda keepin' track of what samples I'm taking or are you havin' a hard time? - [Jackie] So far, I've got the skin sample, the placenta and that's it. - Okay, so far, placenta's been in formalin, and everything I'm stickin' in jars is goin' in formalin and alcohol. Oh, I know we gotta get... Go ahead and drop that, that's fine now. I'll be real surprised if there is anything there. I'll take muscle and body fat next. - [Zookeeper] Muscle. - Looks like veal. - Yeah. - You want a bigger piece? - Yeah. How about one like that then I'll flip the cecum up and then I'll open some of it and you can look at the insides, too. You just got to suck blood while I... Hey, we're gonna do the same with it. I'm not gonna freeze any gut, I don't have any good reason to freeze a gut. I think everybody just wanted liver and kidneys this time. - Six or seven? - Seven samples. - [Dr. Miller] Four formalin, one's alcohol, one karnovsky. - [Jackie] One frozen? - Don't know that I'll freeze stomach, there's probably not much point in it. I'd freeze liver and spleen and stuff. - [Jackie] Okay, spleen comes up next. - I'm gonna want some frozen on this, too. - Spleen all the way. - Freezin', yeah. Freezin' all the tissues and everything else in it. I'm just gonna ... - [Zookeeper] Can you take that back just a little bit? She just, uh. - Anything obvious? - Oh, on her, no, everything was just-- - Bob, I really think it died because of a prolonged labor. I think there was nothin' wrong with the calf except that it just didn't get out fast enough. - [Bob] Is that for the other institutions that want it? - [Bill] Yeah, all the samples and stuff we're doin'. We wanted some photographs of the body and stuff, so I've been doin' that. - See if we can get Hubble to flush out that skull. Or somebody. - He's gonna try. - Let me rinse her off and you can take her. I'll wash out her head for what it's worth. - Is the body ready to go? - Not quite. (workers muttering) - [Bob] Put the skull back there and stuck some feathers in the rabbit. (workers laughing) And I walked back there and I go, "Guys, what's going on?" And they started laughin', it's still back there. - [Bill] Okay, tell him I'll call him back in about 30 minutes. - I don't know how to prop them up, without...(laughing) - [Jackie] We had it on our tarpaulin. (incinerator running) (birds calling) (birds calling) (birds tweeting) - [Child] Let me see. (fish splashing) - [Child] There's thousands of them there! There are thousands of them! (water splashing) (birds calling) - Look, look, look, look! Oh, look! - [Child] Oh, it's funny! - [Visitor] Look at him. (birds calling) - [Child] That's funny. - Girls! - Look at her feed them! Look at her feed them! - Girls! Come on, girls! - [Visitor] Look, look down there, she's gonna feed them. You see. (children exclaiming) - [Zookeeper] She likes to play with them. She's just playin'. - Really? - She's gotta get where she can get the claws first, too. They'll usually they bite the claws off or sling 'em and then they'll break off. They break off really easy, or kill 'em. - [Child] Are you gonna give them crickets? - [Zookeeper] Yeah. - Is that a shrimp? - No, it's crayfish. - Oh, wait, let me see 'em? - Crayfish or crawdads. - Oh, can you eat them? - Yeah, people. - [Zookeeper] I don't. (birds tweeting) (birds singing) (birds calling) (birds calling) (people laughing) - Alice, wait for me, honey, please. (birds tweeting) (visitors muttering) (birds calling) (birds calling) (children exclaiming) (flamingos honking) (birds calling) (flamingos honking) (children exclaiming) (water splashing) (children exclaiming) - [Children] Waterfall! - [Visitor] Look, look, look, look! Look at the parrot! - Whoa, he's pretty, huh? - That's a parrot tree. - Hello! - Huh? - [Child] Hello! (birds tweeting) (water splashing) (birds calling) (birds honking) (birds honking) (children honking) - [Vendor] Okay, $2, ma'am. (crowd muttering) Next, stick or bag? - Both. - [Vendor] There you go, take it away, ma'am. One stick. (calliope music) (children playing) (child laughing) - Hey, I wanna show you! - No! (♪"On a Bicycle Built for Two"♪) - [Visitor] (laughing) Look at that fruit-loop over there. - That's crazy, isn't that? - Yeah. (laughing) Look at him, givin' a look, "What are you doin', "talkin' about me?" (laughing) Oh, you made him mad, he's goin'. "Did you wanna look at me, alright, bye." - [Child] That's silly, who's that? - People ask me why we don't have a nursery here and the reason is because we don't pull our babies if we don't have to. Some of the hoof stock sometime have to be bottle-fed, but after they are bottle fed, they're just put out with the group again. We're fortunate that our primates, all the primates we've had a lot of new primates, have all been mother-reared. So, we don't have a nursery and keep them in a nursery. They're all with their moms. (laughing) Which is great, it's the way it should be. - [Visitor] Stay, Diana. (laughing) - [Child] I don't see him looking at me? - [Visitor] 'Cause they do it on purpose, they know. It's like, "I'm not gonna look at them." Look at his ugly mug. - [Zookeeper] The oldest gorilla in captivity in a zoo was 54 when he died. That's pretty famous, you know, 54. - Is he still alive? - [Zookeeper] No, he died several years ago in Philadelphia Zoo. - What's the average? - [Zookeeper] Average age, I can only say probably from zoo animals, 'cause I read different ones, is probably middle 30s, early 40s. - [Visitor] See, he's really a big fella. You don't wanna get too close to him. (visitors speaking foreign language) (visitor whistling) (gorilla pounding) (visitors laughing) - Did you see that, he banged right into the window! - He sure got that-- - You wanna go in there once? - [Visitor] Maybe not, cause he's on the other side. (saw chopping) (motor running) (radio instructing) - [Bill] What's up? Alright, let's get down to business, lady. (rake banging) She could charge us. Okay, gather them up, see what you can find while I watch. - [Tom] It's right there. Here's a good one, here. - There's a bunch of them. - Oh, good. - There's a bunch down there. - Sure are. - [Bill] We're gonna need another bucket, aren't ya? - Yeah. - Yeah, I think so. - [Bill] Alright, Tom, have these two things mainly. - [Tom] Okay where've you got another container? - [Zookeeper] There's some in the trailer. There's buckets on the back of the truck, Bill. - [Tom] Looks like it may be starting right there? - [Bill] Yeah, you're right, it does look like a light zone there. - [Zookeeper] Have you got a band on one of them? - [Bill] Well, it looks like it may be starting. She just did these. - It's real wet. - Well, then she just did 'em. - Yep, she just did 'em. - They'll band up in about three days if they're fertile, then. - 'Cause we've been watchin' her all this week. She's been doing little scrapings and test digs and stuff in here for the last few days. (laughing) We're gonna have about 30 of them, I think. Before it's over with. - That might be it? - Okay, clean out the loose sand then, just the loose stuff. If you feel it start to get hard, stop. We want to measure the entrance diameter, the depth, the deepest point, vertically. The depth from, like the center of here, back. And then inside, what the width are inside. (visitor exclaiming) (animations creaking and roaring) - We've got some of the best out here from Florida. We've got stylists from everywhere, from basically Palm Beach down. And all it is is a $10 haircut for adults, $5 for kids. We're way over the $1,000 mark now, which means we've cut a lot of heads here today at Metro Zoo. So, if you're walkin' in to the zoo, get your hair cut before you go in, it takes just a few minutes. It's for a very good cause, it's only $10, you'll never get a cheaper haircut. And we're gonna raise a lot of money for Metro Zoo today. (upbeat Calypso music) (people muttering) (Calypso music) - [Camera Crew] Okay, okay, Dave! - Move forward? - Yes, start movin'. Straight, as fast as you can to that speed you're at. A bit faster. A tad faster. (lion roaring) (cage clanging) (cage clanging) (gate falling) (cage clanging) (cage clanging) (gate falling) (cage clanging) (gate squeaking) - Jumbo! Jumbo, come on! Jumbo!

(van beeping) - No, no, no. Relax. No, no, no, no. You're okay, wait. Ready? Shit. (bucket thumping) Come on, big guy, it's your favorite. Come on, come on. Come on. Come on. We're closed, go on back. You can't come up here. (zookeepers muttering) (bird squawking) (sprinklers swishing) (flamingos honking) (ducks quacking) - [Zookeeper] Good boy. - [Dr. Miller] Okay, I need one strong person. What you're gonna do is take him by the scruff of the neck and drag him across the room like we did last time. So start over here. - Come here, it's okay. It's okay. Which, I'm gonna walk that way? Okay, good boy, good boy. Good boy, good boy, keep goin', it's okay. - [Zookeeper] You wanna just wrestle him down? - Easy, good boy. Okay, good, good job. - Good boy! - [Zookeeper] You can take the muzzle off. - [Dr. Miller] It might take him about 10 minutes. And it might make him sick, so as soon as he's calm enough, take that muzzle back off him in case he gets sick, okay? - She said to take it off of him. - [Zookeeper] Oh, okay, good boy. Now, he probably got a little bit of water this morning in the pen. - [Dr. Miller] Keep your faces away just in case he doesn't know what you're doin'. Good boy. - [Zookeeper] That was quicker than 10 minutes. - This is his first time to be knocked down. I don't know how long he'll stay cooperative, so we're gonna do the castration first and then we'll do everything else when we have time. Okay. We need to lift him on to the table. (grunting) Onto this table first. We'll go ahead and shave him and do most of his prep here. Jackie, keep track of his pulse and respirations. (shaver humming) Sorry, kiddo, but you're gonna be different. Do you know where the new ones are? Do you know where the new ones are? - [Zookeeper] Tryin' to leave a little bit of hair in here today, I do believe. - [Dr. Miller] I think it's irritated him, these clippers always leave a bit of a rash. I don't want him to lick it more than anything. - The pus discharge, is that, that's normal for most males? - That's perfectly normal for a male. - Okay, 'cause I know mine does it all the time. - Which, head where? - Toward that end. Let's put him right under the light. And I'll also use that later. And he's quiet. He's got good oxygenation. - [Zookeeper] Just snip those babies right out. (laughing) Wow, wow. - [Jackie] Do you have your suture repair on it? - [Dr. Miller] Nope, I'll need that next in the gut. He's certainly surgically anesthetized. - [Zookeeper] Well he ain't hurtin' is he! (laughing) - [Dr. Miller] Got two pieces here. Anybody want it? - Nah. (laughing) - He's drooling again. - You can wipe him up. (children exclaiming) (birds tweeting) (children exclaiming) (birds tweeting) (rakes scratching) - I know. Look at this one, he poked an eye out. Look at that site there. - Well, at least they ate her. I was gonna say, they ran him for a little while. - [Zookeeper] Yeah, he's got bites everywhere. This one chewed up, too, look at that side. They took everything. There's nothing we can do for them. - [Dr. Miller] They took him down in the hamstrings, too. - [Zookeeper] Yeah. Yeah, wild ones. - Well, feral ones, probably. People let their damn animals run. Well, you can tell that zebu got grabbed by the nose a few dozen times by the way they're swollen up. These guys got taken down by the hamstrings, probably. - [Zookeeper] Quick, too. - In case you want a press release, this is a real good educational thing, if you don't mind a little negative publicity. I mean, this is people lettin' their dogs roam, feral dogs, and what the hell they do to a place. Once you move the bodies, they're not as good a shot. But, you got two females taken down on the haunches. - Really? - [Zookeeper] These dogs spent some time in here. - Yeah, they had a great time here. The kangaroos are a little bit-- - The wallabies are, the Bennett's have some abrasions. They were behind the Bennett's Wallabies, there are tracks all up and down the little sand behind the holding pen. They appear okay, the joey still in the patch. The kangaroos appear all right. The brush tail are okay. I'm amazed that the yellow back survived, but why not the zebu? I'm just astounded, 'cause they're really, they're so damned nervous. Bill Conklin saw a dog running in the direction of kangaroo from his area, which meant it went back over there somewhere. - Do they think they're still on the ground? - Well, if these dogs have been in before through a hole in the fence, they're probably gone. We'll look for them, but they know where to come and go. But you can tell from some of the tracks in here that-- - [Dr. Miller] Oh, yeah, they've been diggin' through the fences. - This is some good-sized tracks. - [Bill] I hate dogs. - That's a big paw right there. - [Zookeeper] Yeah, that's a 75-80 pound dog. - [Zookeeper] Look at that. - You can tell by the teeth mark in the guy's haunches over there. - Shepherd-sized dog. - Same as the other one. - You got canines that are at least shepherd-sized in that guy. Here's some decent tracks as well. Not quite as big. - Damn it! - [Bill] Where'd they get in here at, did you see a place? Anywhere they dug in, or? - There's something marked over there, but it doesn't look like they dug under. - [Zookeeper] They may have come over. 'Cause there's no... I can't see it? - [Dr. Miller] The male'll give you a better idea of what size you are 'cause they've got teeth marks that didn't finish at the flesh. We got some noshing in it. - This happened fairly late. If he was hot? - Yeah, they're all cool now. - Oh, damn, this is a good male. - There's no dug out spot. - Yeah, where's, uh? - There is some digging over at zebu. - Zebu there's digging underneath the pens. - [Zookeeper] They can get under the moat there at zebu. - Yeah, right. But, still, they were digging over the pen. - [Dr. Miller] There's nothing we can do for them anymore. - The only fence they could come in is that one over there, they pushed at the bottom. - Or the one that we walked through. - [Bill] Does anybody have any idea of numbers? I would say a minimum of three, a maximum of God-knows how many? - It looked like at least three different-sized sets of tracks in the lechwe pen. One being a good-sized dog. (cow grunting) - [Dr. Miller] If she goes down, let her down. - [Bill] It's fairly good here, not many punctures back here. - [Dr. Miller] Looking everywhere. - [Bill] She still got a tongue, or any of that? - [Dr. Miller] She's got pieces of her tongue. They just grabbed her by her nose and swung her around a bit. Or, she swung them about. Easy, sweetheart. - [Bill] She's got a pretty good puncture right here. - [Zookeeper] And two lats ones. - [Bill] Yeah, it's a pretty good one, I can't tell how far in it goes? - He grabbed her tongue but he only got pieces of it. It's not too swollen, she can still breathe through her nose. For now, anyway. She's gonna need a lot more than one dose of antibiotics. - Okay. - Hey, what's your location? - [Zookeeper] I'm right at the controlled burn site, working the woods east. - Go. - Mike is in the woods. He's heading in your direction, just so you know that. - [Zookeeper] It's amazing, this palmetto isn't three-feet deep and you could lose a cow in there. Ron, Bill's just off your left shoulder, about 200 yards out. - [Radio] Three, freeze one. - Alice, get on the radio, find out where David's at? - Okay, we just caught up with Bill Ziegler, he's over about 50 yards to the left. Keep goin'. And Ron's about 30 yards to your left. - He's still close. - Can you see him? - [Zookeeper] Yeah, he's comin' back to the truck. (gun firing) There's two, Michael, there's two of 'em! (gun firing) - [Bill] These pads are big enough to create the marks we saw. - Yeah. (radio instructing) - Okay, who sexed it as a female? (laughing) - What? - Who said it was a female? - I did. - Come on over here. We're gonna give you a lesson in anatomy. (laughing) - I couldn't see it, it was in the bushes. It's a pitbull, it was. - [Zookeeper] The maggots are already in on him, layin' eggs, all the eggs. - Yeah, blowflies. - [Alice] I don't really want to see, but. - [Bill] Let's load him on the truck before the monorail shows up. - Those are eggs? - Get him outta here. - [Zookeeper] You want to put him in this truck, you can put him in the toolbox. - [Alice] Nature does things quick, doesn't it? - [Bill] I don't want to put him in the toolbox! - Under the toolbox. - Oh, yeah, I was goin'... - Pitbull's have a big body? - He's probably 65. - [Zookeeper] I thought he'd be triple that. - [Carl] I don't want to try to carry a dog, and crutches and everything all at the same time. - Oh, come on, Carl. - And look like an idiot. - [Carl] What, you think he's gettin' mange from you? (laughing) Can you handle it all by yourself? - In the incinerator? - Yes. - Incinerator? - Yeah. - [Zookeeper] On top of the pile. Now wash off. - Yeah. - [Carl] Five was the highest count we got, we can account for three. - We ready to torch this, do you know? - What? - We haven't burned it. - [Carl] I think she was just waitin' for the dog to get in. - Okay, how much time are we usin' these days? - [Carl] Usually we do it for about an hour-and-a-half and then check it. (incinerator humming) - [Zookeeper] It's on two. - Komodo dragon update. The Komodo Dragon Consortium, which is a group of about eight zoos that has been working on this komodo dragon project for well over three years now. Is gonna meet in early March to assess its position with the government of Indonesia. As you are aware, we had an agreement. The new director of wildlife, Statisna, then threw a curve to everybody and demanded gorillas in exchange for the komodo dragons. We've got that straightened out, there will be no gorillas, no exchange of gorillas for komodos. Now we have to go back and reassess what the position's gonna be with the government of Indonesia. It may require another trip to Indonesia. The program's still alive, but quite frankly, it's not well. The Consortium may fall apart, I don't know. We have some indication that on the local level here, that the former director of the society and a current donor has some very good contacts in Indonesia, a lot depends on what the conditions are, stipulations involved going through private sources to get them. And, whether the U.S. Government will issue import permits. There is a possibility there. I'll keep ya up to speed on that. On a sad note, about two-and-a-half years of work ended in a lot of frustration. We shipped our female Indian rhino from Miami to Philadelphia, to New York, and back to Miami as part of the SSP Program. She was in a prolonged labor and the end result was she delivered a stillborn calf. So, we'll start all over again. It was her first pregnancy, sometimes these things happen. That's all I have to report for right now. - The donor of the komodo mini-exhibit is standing firm, waiting for the komodo. So, we have $150,000 towards a $300,000 exhibit and he is prepared to give us the balance of the $300,000. We met with him, he doesn't plan to take the money back in any way. He is so enthusiastic about the komodo dragon exhibit, that he's prepared to do one of these mercenary raids, (members laughing) and get on a plane and go to Indonesia and kidnap a komodo and fly it back to Miami. Now, I don't think he's kidding, we discouraged him. But, one of these Ross Perot, commando raids, he's ready to go. And if I thought he'd get away with it with the American authorities, I'd encourage him. But, we're tryin' to hold him still. The good thing is, the money's gonna wait. - This is not as heavy as the others, it's not showin' either. It's really rounded here, not at the point. This is almost the same. - [Zookeeper] We got tortoise eggs in all the small containers that we have. - [Bill] 'Cause I don't want to put them in with the main group. - [Zookeeper] Yeah, 'cause they got to live after that. - 7.62. Width is, uh, 7.56. Weight's 100. Where's the box? - [Tom] Turn the lights off, we should be pretty well set there. - [Bill] Yeah, we'll come back and put them on. (birds tweeting) - Look over there. - Yeah. (child exclaiming) - There's another one over there. (children exclaiming) (wind rustling) - Stop, stop, stop. Come on, you've got a job to do. Stop, stop. Give me a hug, give me a hug (people muttering) - [Server] Ma'am would you like any salad? - Yes, please. - [Server] Plates are right here with the forks and napkins. Please enjoy. (guest exclaiming) (guests laughing) - They're down away. - Thank you very much. - Don't know where they are? - You got more ready? (Spanish guitar music) (men singing in Spanish) (parrots cawing) (guests laughing) (food sizzling) (guests muttering) (engine starting) (guests muttering) - It's not ours. - All the more reason. - [Guest] It's like I already trashed a pair of stockings, no, it's not garbage, it's take-home plastic bags. - Sir, this one's yours. - No.
