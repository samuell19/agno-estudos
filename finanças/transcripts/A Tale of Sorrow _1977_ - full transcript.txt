But she must win Golf is a professional sport I agree It's only one month before the tournament If the standard comes down, it takes 23 years to train up Before becoming a professional player But she is a genius, I bet you You should be careful What is it? You should be careful in handling money To avoid misunderstanding Grandpa! Grandpa! What is it? I want to tell you something I'm coming over Why must you challenge for a higher position?

Will Eiko play well to the end of the game? It's the 13th hole What is it? Did she get it? Yes she did Wonderful And then, to the green Well done Eiko fails to hit the ball It's out of the bound.
