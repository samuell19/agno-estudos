Brought your school books? Yes, Sister. Zhengda says... you can prepare his opium when you're not busy studying. My luck is terrible today! Nothing but bad hands! You're doing quite well, if you ask me! Sixty thousand. That does it! Ruyi! Stop it! Your father's going to spank you! Ruyi! Ruyi! Ruyi, do as I say! Do as I say! Look at her! Ruyi! Ruyi! You're not allowed in there! Elder Qi, it's true, the Emperor has abdicated. Duanwu, catch her! Pang An! This is an outrage! A girl in the ancestral hall! Even if the Emperor has abdicated! It's unthinkable! A girl in the ancestral hall! 1911 XI NGHAI REVOLUTION Uncle An! Can Miss Ruyi come out and play later? Master doesn't want her coming out at all. SEVERAL YEARS LATER TheJing family are all bastards! How dare they break off the engagement with Ruyi! Just because the Emperor abdicated doesn't mean they can insult us like this! They say our Young Miss has smoked opium since she was a baby. They say she is poison. Bullshit! We study day and night... to learn what's wrong and right. Brother, I'm too heavy for you. Put me down. Brother-in-law. Opium is a wonderful thing. How can I put it? Opium... How can anyone describe it? Yes, it is poison. Just like this arsenic. But me... it's made me strong. No poison could kill me. Zhongliang... Kiss your sister. Why don't you kiss her? Come here. Come on. Kiss sister! Never mind. Run along to bed. Go now. Zhongliang! Give your sister a kiss. Kiss her! Go on. I'll teach you to be a man. SIX MONTHS LATER Zhongliang! Zhengda wants his opium pipe! Zhongliang. Zhengda's waiting. Is this the train to Peking? Is this the train to Peking? Thief! SHANGHAI,1920s Zhongliang... I've won. Let me kiss you. So, you'd like a kiss? Would you? Don't make a sound. Not one sound. Now, Mrs. Liu... who's going to phone your husband? You or us? I don't understand! So, you want me to call? Zhongliang! Zhongliang is dead! How much money do you want? Hey, Mister! Spare some change? Zhongliang... You called for me? Zhongliang... Do you want me? You sure there's nothing I can do for you ladies? PANG FAMI LY ESTATE Ancestral Hall I've gathered you here... because Old Master Pang has passed away. His eldest son Zhengda should become the new family head. But ten years ago, he was stricken with a sudden illness. And he has seen no one since. Few people knew of his condition. But now, with the Old Master gone... it's time to face facts. Quiet in the hall! Ask Master Zhengda to enter. I, Pang An, kowtow to our ancestors on Zhengda's behalf. Zhengda's mind has been destroyed. He cannot speak. He cannot do anything, in fact. But as long as he's alive, he is Master... of the Pang family. Zhengda is too ill... to manage family affairs. Old Master also had a daughter, Ruyi. Please, Elder Qi, speak for us. Very well. Zhengda... shall we ask Miss Ruyi to look after family affairs? Master Zhengda heartily approves. Call her in then. Because Ruyi is a girl... she'll be a bit weak. I've conferred with the other elders... and we've decided to ask a male cousin to help her out. Pang Duanwu! Pang Duanwu! We've chosen Duanwu. He is a Pang. But he's not a direct heir. No! Not this way! That way! A closer relative might have personal ambitions... but not a distant cousin. He has nothing to gain and everything to lose. Hurry. Hurry and kowtow to your cousin. Duanwu is Ruyi's cousin, but he may call her Elder Sister. Elder Sister... Boss. Sorry you had to wait. Had a bath? Yes, I like to have a good soak whenever I can. You haven't come by in a while. Ready to leave the nest? Your sister's father-in-law, Old Master Pang, is dead. I want you to go visit your sister. And then... you can bring Pang's daughter, Ruyi, to Shanghai... for a nice little vacation. Leave the rest to us. Boss, please... don't send me there. HEAVENLY LANE It's only me. Hold me. I need to go home early... to make dinner for my husband. Zhongliang. Do you love me? Sorry. I shouldn't have asked. Take some cash. Put it on our tab at the club. Thanks, Boss. No need to see me out. Don't worry, Boss. Zhongliang. You've been working on that woman a long time, no? Which one? The one in Heavenly Lane. Her husband's out of town. We can't move on her. Maybe you're getting too involved. From this moment, Young Miss... you are the head of the Pang family. I, Pang An, formally pay my respects. Ruyi... your father's and brother's concubines are... Sit down, Duanwu. Miss... the concubines are all clamoring... for their monthly stipends. Our accounts are behind... because of your father's funeral. Give them their money and ask them to leave. - Pardon? - They're not needed. So, the family hasn't chosen a wife for you yet? No. When my father was alive... they arranged a marriage for me. But the other family broke it off... because I smoke opium. Ruyi listens to reason, yes? Yes, I do. Will Ruyi listen to Elder Qi? Yes. Please sit down, Elder Qi. Ruyi. This matter deserves careful consideration. These women served Old and Young Master. If we throw them out on the street, people will laugh at us. Elder Qi... we're not leaving them destitute. This house is no place for women. There's nothing for them here. Better to let them go for their own good. All right then! Did you hear that? How can you speak that way to an elder? Old Master's only been gone a few days! What do you say, Duanwu? I stand by Elder Sister. What? Did everyone hear that? There are no more real men in this family! Was I wrong to send the women away? Those concubines lived here for many years. They had a good life with father and brother. Now it's over... and they're gone. As for me... I have to stay here. I was born here. I grew up here. I'll die here. What are you doing here? Get out of here! After what you did! You shouldn't be here! Go away! Stop it! Sister. See that Zhongliang gets settled... in rooms near mine. Studying in Peking has made you quite a gentleman. Last time I saw you, you were only this high! Sir, your room is ready. Thanks. I'll take it myself. - Who's that? - Duanwu, Ruyi's cousin. In name he's a master. In fact he's a servant. He prepares Ruyi's opium pipe. I know that role well. I'll go wash up. Miss, where is the family library? Over there. Thank you. Miss, why are you following me? I forgot to tell you. There are no books in the library anymore. Be careful. Miss... your sister-in-law says her brother's on his way to see you. Her brother? Very well. If I have any visitors, tell them I'm not feeling well. Sister-in-law, Ruyi is not here. Please come in. This is my brother Zhongliang. He just finished school in Peking. He's come to say hello to Ruyi. Sister-in-law. I am Zhongliang. Help yourself to whatever books you wish to read. Have you two met? Is this what you wear? Is this what you read? Is this the life you lead? These silks and satins are hideous. Do you know how much the world has changed in ten years? Do you? Russian Revolution, Great War... warlords... Nationalism... Lenin, Communism, Sun Yat-sen... freedom from arranged marriages... equal rights for women... youths dying for a cause. Have you heard? Girl students in Peking wear skirts... and short tops with tight waists. They stroll by the Forbidden City... with little red flags in their hands. Walls tall and red... bordered by weeping willows swaying in the breeze. The Peking sky is blue and clear. The palace towers are decorated with gold... and white kites sail in the air. Higher and higher... further and further... till they're gone. Do you want to spend the rest of your life here? You stayed in Peking for so long. How could you be so cruel and not write even once? You know... Sister, that's enough. Duanwu, come here. Kneel! Why did we let a distant relation, like yourself... into the family's inner sanctum? Because you seemed loyal and honest. We were quite surprised when Ruyi sent the women away. And you not only failed to dissuade her, but even aided her! You traitor! You've sent away all the women... of Old Master and his son. It's no small matter, you know. A grown man like you trailing after that girl. It's all backwards. Are you after the family fortune? Pang An, I don't want one penny. All I want is to look after my sister. Your "sister" indeed! And if she marries? I'll go with her. We're finished! Are there no real men left in this family? My poor ancestors! The Pangs haven't a man left! I weep before Young Master Zhengda! Old Master's dead! Old Master! We've no men left. Old Master! It's not every day one sees loyalty like yours to Ruyi. Zhongliang. Zhongliang. You haven't seen him yet. Husband... Iook... Iook who's come back. Sir... Sir... Miss Ruyi sent me to ask you... to teach her how to ride a bicycle. Your Young Miss thinks everyone's her servant, does she? If you're too busy... Look straight ahead! Look ahead! I want to kiss you. SUZHOUN BOARDI NG HOUSE Near Pang Estate Fuck! It's been two days! Why no word from you? What's with you? How's it going? - That was quick. - I'm just getting started. How come there's two? These are the goods Miss Pang ordered. What's this? How foolish of me... I forgot you Pangs would need to search me. Maybe Miss Ruyi has forgotten... when I was a boy, I was her brother's servant. So go ahead. Keep looking! Do it! Search my things! Hurry up! Sir, you mustn't treat Elder Sister like this! She's curious because she likes you! That's the way she is. She likes me? Whether I like her is more the point. Why are you here? What do you think? Just a sisterly visit to my little brother. They have things like these in Shanghai. ThatJing boy who was engaged to Ruyi works in Shanghai. He studied in Japan. Do you know why they broke the engagement? What's it to me? Zhongliang, you couldn't get close to her. She's poison. What a joke! The idea of me with her. I've seen you. I've seen you kiss her. You can't lie to me! Me, lie to you? How shall I put this, Sister? I served her brother. How could I dare court the mistress of the house? How could I? I was nothing but a slave to you and Zhengda... a worthless, poor relation. I hate this place and everyone in it! I see. You hate even me. Yes! Yes, I do! I was 13 when you brought me here... You had no one else! To live with you and "study." You made everyone call me "Sir," but I was just your servant! "Zhongliang... "Brought your school books? "Prepare Zhengda's opium pipe when you're not studying. "Zhongliang... "Come here. Give sister a kiss. Come on!" I'll never love again. Never. I'll never love again... because of you. I see. Then why are you here? Why don't you leave then? I'm not as pretty as she is. She's not as pretty as you. You're a young girl. But Father always said that a woman is more beautiful than a girl. That's just men's talk. Aren't you a man? I'd rather not be. You're wrong, you know. A woman is more beautiful than a girl. I'm sure... Zhongliang does like you. Do you think so? I don't want to be a girl anymore. I've come to tuck you in. What is it? I'm heavy. You get on top. Hold me here. Like this. You're pressing me. Let me come up a bit more. Put your hand here. I'll hold you here. Is that right? Here? I'll move my leg a little. Yesterday was all my fault. Please don't be mad at me. Even if you are mad at me, I still like you. Duanwu. You may go. Sir, this is a note for you from Ruyi. How is Master doing today? He's doing well. Did he eat all his food? Will he sleep here tonight? So here's where the Pang men had their fun, eh? Zhongliang... Not like that. Hold me here. I'll hold you there. - You're heavy. I'll get on top. - Be quiet! I know what to do. I've practiced with Duanwu for you. Zhongliang! Don't you want me? I have to leave here. I don't want to stay either. Take me with you. If I can't take you to Peking... I won't take you anywhere. Let me look at you. I want to look at you. Boss misses you. He keeps asking after you. He wants a report. Tell Boss... I'll be back in Shanghai in 3 days. Tomorrow morning we leave for Peking. So, you're off? Early tomorrow. Zhongliang. I know you don't want me along. But you owe it to me! I can't go on like this. I've been so lonely here... these ten years... Iooking into that face every day... I know. But I have to leave you... I can't bear to watch you suffer! So take me! Take me so I won't suffer! I can't take you. You'll always remind me of this place. And I'll never forget... what happened. And me? After it happened... I smuggled you out of here... but I stayed behind, with no thought for myself. Ten years and you never once wrote. I nearly went mad! Who could I turn to? Now you're back and in love with that witch. You won't even let me... cry on your shoulder. Zhongliang... What you did ruined my life. Me, the one person in the world who really loves you. You've destroyed me! Come with me! Take a look! This is my life! One male fish. One female. Ten years with two fish! Brother... come give Sister a kiss. Take care, Sister. Duanwu! Duanwu! Pang An. Pang An? Pang An! Ruyi's run off with my brother! Pang An! Pang An! Pang An. Pang An! I've lost Zhongliang! He told me to wait, then he disappeared! I can't find him anywhere! Duanwu! Zhongliang! Zhongliang! Zhongliang! You traitor! Did you think you'd be Master if Ruyi left? What will you try next? Beat the traitor! Beat this bastard! We'll make a man of you yet! This will teach you! Wonder if Zhongliang's in Peking yet. - Zhongliang's here. - What's he doing? He's in the dance hall. - Watch him. - Okay. Boss wants to see you. You're back. Come here. Have a drink. Boss... I've done you wrong. Welcome back to Shanghai. You belong here. It's not the same without you. Boss... I lied to you. The woman on Heavenly Lane... her husband's been back a long time. I'll do the job! I'll do it tomorrow! I lied to you! I lied! Zhongliang... It's all right. I lied to you! I should never have sent Zhongliang to the Pangs. It was my mistake. There's plenty of money in the world... but only one Zhongliang. I need him. Zhongliang's a son to you. When he cried that night... and promised to do the Heavenly Lane job... I knew he'd finally come around. No, he cried because his heart was divided. This worries me. How shall I put it? When an immortal descends to earth... how can he return to the sky? We have to get... this Heavenly Lane business right. Let's let the Pang girl... see for herself what Zhongliang's really like. She'll fall right out of love. Then he'll be able to move on. Boss... Know what to do? Go to Ruyi, say Zhongliang sent me to take her to Peking. Instead, bring her to Shanghai... and take her home when it's over. Boss doesn't want the Pangs' fortune... Boss only wants Zhongliang. Miss Pang. I'm going to make a phone call. Wait here. This is Shanghai! Good. Settle them in first. Bye. We'll finish the Heavenly Lane job tomorrow. Country boy! Come have fun! Fuck off. Mind your own business. Come on, Miss Pang. Come in. You're right... You're in Shanghai, not Peking. Zhongliang's here in Shanghai too. Tomorrow morning at 6:00... I'll take you to see him. I'm going to see him tomorrow. These are Zhongliang's... classmates. Isn't he here? I've missed you so much. Don't. I want to look at you. Go ahead. I've wronged you. I'm so sorry! Zhongliang! Quiet. Don't make a sound. - Zhongliang! - He's dead. Mrs. Shen, will you call your husband or shall I? Phone him? Why? Why? To ask him over. We'll all have a friendly chat. But maybe you, me and Zhongliang can manage on our own? Zhongliang? That's right. He's one of us. Well, Mrs. Shen? What? Are you crazy? I'll make the call! Zhongliang... I don't care about what's happened today... I just want to know... did you ever love me? Talk to me! Tell her. Speak. Come on! Say something! Did you ever love me? I see. Ah San! Let's get out of here! HEAVENLY LANE Police taken care of? All done. My poor Zhongliang. He's ruined. Go away! Give me back my Zhongliang. I want the old Zhongliang back! Little sister, can I find you a customer? You could start tonight. Try it! Get your kicks, make some money. Stop acting like a saint. You're no better than the rest of us. I got lost. Those women chased me. In Shanghai... men and women are at war. One side will win, the other will lose. Some women would die for their man. Like the one who jumped. She lost the war. She lost. I don't want to lose. Are you listening? Tomorrow I'm going to see Zhongliang. Did you love her? What's it to you? You came to Shanghai to ask that? You put on Western clothes and you act up! Know what I am? Or how many women I've had? I use and betray them! I grind them into the dirt! But still... they want me. They kneel before me. They cry for me, smile for me! Did you love her? I'm not a servant anymore. We men rule in Shanghai! Well put. Miss Pang... are you still in love with him now? If you'd like a few more days in Shanghai... I'm at your service. Tell me when you want to go. Zhongliang... whoever you are... I don't mind. Do you love me? Tell me. Tell me. Duanwu! Duanwu. Sister-in-law. You're back. Did you see my brother? Duanwu. Duanwu! I shouldn't tell you how he makes his living. Young MasterJing is here. MasterJing? The one whose family broke the engagement with you. Why's he here? He didn't say. He's been waiting for days. Here he is. Come, Young MasterJing. Please... Young Miss is back. This is Young MasterJing. Your father broke our engagement. Yes, but he never consulted me. Not about the betrothal, nor its cancellation. When I was in Japan I decided... I would meet you myself. How else would I know what you were like? I smoke opium. I'm poison. Doesn't that bother you? I work for myself in Shanghai. And I can choose the kind of wife I want. Zhongliang is ruined. Little brother. Zhongliang, I know about Shanghai. It's all my fault! It is! But Ruyi can't save you! Don't go after her! Who sacrificed everything to save you? Me! Remember? Your sister! No, this can't be true. I know you're angry with me. You're not marrying for love... but out of spite. In your heart... it's me you really want. Let's go to Peking. This time I mean it. I don't love you. Come with me to Peking! I don't love you anymore. Why did you come to the club? If you hadn't... I wouldn't be here now. I went to ask you something. You refused to answer me... same as that other woman. You wouldn't answer me... but now I understand. You can't answer. You're afraid. Your heart is dead. You cannot love. I love you! It's too late. I love you. It's too late now. In a few days... I'll be a bride. I've always wanted to get married. I've been waiting... waiting. My bridal costume's nearly finished. And I've chosen my husband. I can do whatever I want... and this is what I want. I'm going to Shanghai. I'll be back in three days. I've prepared your bags, sir. But I have something to tell you. The Young Miss has slept with... both me and Zhongliang. What he says is true. Here. I just poisoned your husband. I put arsenic in his opium. I'll say good-bye now. I'm really going to Peking this time. I don't know why... but I often think of that evening I first came here... and how the moon... was so bright. We were all so young then. You ran barefoot... in the Ancestral Hall and I saw you outside... with Duanwu. If only we didn't have to grow up... it would be perfect. I always prepared Zhengda's opium. I've prepared this opium for you. Here. Good-bye, Zhongliang. Elder Sister... shall I help you? Zhongliang prepared it. I'll do it myself. This will be the last time... I'm giving it up after the wedding. Zhongliang! From now on, Duanwu is the official head of the household. The Young Master Zhengda approves! He is too ill to be here. But Miss Ruyi ought to be present.
