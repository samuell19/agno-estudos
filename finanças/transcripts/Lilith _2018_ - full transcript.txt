I heard you puked during PE. It was after PE and it's whatever. I'm probably just coming down with a bug or something. Yeah, a procrastination bug. No, really. April, I am studying. Yeah, I'm sure you're thinking about your lover. No. What, I thought you liked Colin. Oh, yeah, him. There's someone else. Tell me. (LAUGHS) Oh, no, wait, let me guess. Okay, is he in our class? Uh, you could say that. Okay. Okay, wait, I got this. Mason. What? Trevor? Oh, God, Noah. I can't believe we're actually talking about this. Well, that's all the eligible bachelors. Hmm. Wait. When you said you could say that, you weren't referring to someone our age, were you? (LAUGHS) Come on, B. That's gross. Oh, come on. What's wrong with him? He's like as old as your father. Actually, I'm pretty sure that he's older than my dad. Even more reason not to. He is mature and he treats me like an adult, so why shouldn't I? B, that's just so gross and may I add, illegal. MAN: What's illegal? Dad, privacy! - Oh, my god. - Sorry, sorry. You left the door open. I just came in to say dinner's ready. Okay. Hey, Mr. Carson. What's for dinner? Hey, April. It's spaghetti. Think you can stomach that, B? (CHUCKLES) What's that supposed to mean? Don't worry, Mr. Carson. - Inside joke. - Okay, Dad. Alrighty. Good seeing you again, April. Bye, Mr. Carson.

Without the hands. - You're gonna put 'em up here. - No, no, stop. I'm gonna ask her to be my girlfriend. If she says yes, then yeah. I'll take her from behind, you know. The front and maybe in the mouth. You are such an ass, dude. No, I'm not. Shut up. Get out of my face. - You never listen to me. - Stay out of my business. TOM: I told you that. I'm trying to be your assistant. BOY: I'll jack you up. (BOTH LAUGH) Um, why don't you go on ahead? Okay, all right. - I see. - Stop, stop. APRIL: Don't do anything I wouldn't do. Oh, my god. APRIL: Bye, B. (CLOCK TICKING) TEACHER: Oh, hello, Brook. How can I help you today? Um, I just needed some help with my homework. That doesn't sound like the Brook I know. Yeah, it's just that this chapter is so long and I didn't think that I would be able to handle it all by myself. You know, we can't keep meeting up like this. Well, we could always go back to your place. Not until the divorce is final and you know that. I know. God, I just... I love you so much. And I want you all the time. Then I guess this empty classroom will have to do. All right. (BROOK LAUGHS) (CHATTERING) Dude, there she is. Go talk to her, go talk to her. Hey, hey! TEACHER: Hey, boys. So, how long has this been going on for? For about a month or so. (LAUGHS) It's just so blah. How is he? I thought you said he was gross. I could be curious. Oh, my god. (LAUGHING) (RETCHING) (GASPING) (RETCHING) (PHONE RINGING) Hello? Hey, hey. How's the prettiest girl in Spanish Three doing? Hi, Colin. What's up? You excited for our date? What? You know, I'm gonna take you to the movie that you were telling me about. That scary one. I'll hold your hand if you want. Um, yeah. I'm sorry, I don't think I'm gonna be able to go. I'm coming down with like a bug or something. Oh, that sucks. Well, maybe I can come by. I can, maybe, make you some soup or something. I don't know. I have to go. I'm sorry. Hey, Brook. Hold on a second, Brook. (TENSE MUSIC) BROOK: Do you love me? What? Do you love me? Calm down. People are gonna hear. I need to know. Do you love me? Well, of course I love you. Why would you ask such a thing? BROOK: And you care a whole lot about me, right? Well, yeah. What about now? James? James? Are you kidding me? BROOK: What? Is this your idea of a fucking joke? What did you think was gonna happen, I was gonna leave my wife, my job, for you? Get out of my classroom! You said that you would get a divorce. You said that you loved me. Get out. I need time to think. And don't you even think about telling anybody about this. Hey, Brook, Brook. Oh! Is this why you canceled on me Friday night? What were you doing in there? I, um. You fucking slut. I thought you liked me. I do like you, you just don't understand. Oh, I don't understand. I don't understand? It seems pretty fucking clear what's going on, Brook. You think I'd date you after this? You're fucking used. Slut. (PHONE RINGING) BROOK: April, April. Hey, B, what happened? Where were you all day? I had to... April, I'm sorry, I had to... I'm pregnant. Wait, what? I took the test and I'm pregnant and Colin is... And my dad, he's gonna kill me. I can't go to Colin. I don't know what to do, April. Okay, B? Stay calm, I'll be right over, okay? He said he loved me. He said he loved me! He's a liar! He lied to me. B, don't do anything stupid. I'll be right there, okay? (SOBBING) (KNOCKING ON DOOR) Brook? Brook! Brook, it's me. Open up, Brook. Oh, my god. Brook! (TENSE MUSIC) (BREATHING HEAVILY) Hey, April. What are you doing here? No. No, no, no, no. No, Brook, Brook! Brook, no! No, Brook, no! Why? No. (SOBBING) (WATER BUBBLING) Y'all wanna make some money? (CELL PHONE VIBRATING) What the fuck are we doing out here? Just shut up, Tom. Look, do you wanna make some fucking money or what? This is so stupid. We're gonna get in a lot of trouble. No, we won't. All right, he just pulled in. He'll be here. Do you have it? Yeah, yeah, here. What? A BB gun? You said we just have to scare him, right? Are you sure this is gonna work? Look, he needs to pay for what he did to Brook. He's going to pay. So, just put on your masks and let's go. Hey, why do you get the red one? (GUN COCKS) Fucking punks. (TENSE MUSIC) You got the money? April, is that you? What? No. Just give us the fucking money, man. Relax, relax. I've got the money right here. APRIL: Check it out. Go, go, check it out. COLIN: Count it. TOM: Okay, scoot back. It's just clothes. APRIL: What the? COLIN: Hey, hey, hey! Put that down. (GUN CLICKING) Hey, hey! APRIL: Run! (GUN FIRES) (TOM GROANS) Wait, don't leave me! Help. Help me. Help me, please, please. (GUN FIRES) APRIL: Hey, hey. (SUSPENSEFUL MUSIC) What, are you guys fucking stupid? You think I have that kind of cash? Did you see the piece of shit I drove here in? I'm a public school teacher for fuck's sake. Kids, come on now. This labyrinth bullshit is getting tired. BROOK: In her moment of need, you abandoned her. You berated her. You abandoned her. No. I didn't! BROOK: You berated her. I'm, I'm. Okay, I'm sorry! BROOK: There, there. All is forgiven. (GROWLS) (COLIN YELLING) COLIN: Oh, my god! I didn't want this to happen. Brook came onto me. Hello? Can you hear me? I'm a happily married man. Kids? April? We're at the school. I'm trapped. Please, just help. I'll get him in trouble. (GASPS) (OMINOUS MUSIC) You let her die. No. No, I tried to help her. You let her die. I tried to stop her. I don't know how, but... You knew what was going on and you knew how it would end. Did you report it to anybody? Did you do anything to try and stop it? No. Instead, you tried to turn a profit. How much money is a life worth? You disgust me. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. (OMINOUS SCREECHING) (GASPING) (APRIL SCREAMS) Fuck this. You son of a bitch! (YELLS) Where do you think you're going? Brook? You said that you loved me. You said that you loved me. (GUN FIRING) Hey. How could you take advantage of a teenage girl like that? How could you be so cruel? No, no, no, no. I didn't want this. I didn't want this to happen. No more lies. We both know that this wasn't your first time. (GROWLING) (JAMES YELLING) Do you love me? Say it. Do you love me? (YELLING) Freeze! I said, freeze! Brook? Daddy? But you're... But you're... I don't understand. It's okay, Daddy. Everything's gonna be okay now. I'm in a better place. And Lilith, she's gonna take care of me and my baby from now on. Lilith? Baby? Honey, I didn't know. I'm so sorry, Daddy. I'm sorry for everything. And if you want to live, you need to go now. I'm almost done here. Go now. What? I said go! (JAMES GROANING) MAN ON RADIO: Detective Carson from Dispatch. This is Carson, over. MAN ON RADIO: Did you just respond to a disturbance in your area? CARSON: Yeah, it was a false alarm. Just some kids playing a prank. MAN ON RADIO: Copy that. Dispatch out. Carson out. (TENSE MUSIC) How much longer? This should be it. Is she secured? Yes. She's chained to the pole in the devil's snare. You wanna see if I did it right? Did you follow my instructions? Yes. Then you did it right. Traditionally, I don't like to make myself known until I'm ready to confront the demon. Traditionally? You've done this before? No, I haven't. Father, when I contacted you, you said you've done this before. No, I said I studied this. This is archaic doctrine. You shot her? She doesn't go down easy, Padre. No. We perform exorcisms to save the victims. Killing the body releases the demon. Father, this isn't possession. She is the demon. What's her name? Lilith. Holy Mary Mother of God. Pray for our sins now. Sinners now. And at the hour of our death, bless me Father for I am the original sinner. You know what we have here? First born of the fallen. How do we get rid of her? You don't. But if you're lucky, I'll forget about you. Problem for you, I don't forgive or forget, but I do deal. (LAUGHING) (SUBDUED MUSIC) (BREATHING HEAVILY) (SOBBING) (GROANS) (KEYS JINGLE) Who are you? WOMAN: I'm sorry. They said to just walk in. MAN: What the hell are you doing here? My name's Lilith. I'm the new caretaker. What the hell happened to the old one, Jennifer? Americare sent me over. They said that Jessica had to take a leave of absence. May I? I really liked her. She was good and very pretty. What did you say your name was again? Lilith. Not Joanne? Oh, I do look just like her, don't I? I hope that doesn't bring you any pain. She looks like a fine woman. No. No, you couldn't be her. She's dead. I know. If it's all right, I'm here to take care of you, if you'll have me. Yes. Yes, please. Please stay, Joanne. Please. I'll take care of everything. (TENSE MUSIC) Time to eat your lunch, Phil. What did you call me? Phil. It's okay, right? Only my Joanne can call me that. I'm sorry, Phillip. Can I join you? Sure. You sit just like her. I take it I'm gonna remind you a lot of her. Could be a good thing. Yes, could be. How long has she been gone? Nearly 10 years. Good woman like that. She's with God. Yes. Think you'll be reunited with her one day? Eat up, you're gonna need it. Tell me about her. What made her so great? I was not always a nice man. I did things. She saw right through that. LILITH: What did you do? I don't want to talk about that. How did she die? I guess God decided that she had been with me long enough, so he gave her cancer. And he took her back home. I hated you for that. Taking her. LILITH: Yeah, Grandpa can be a bastard like that. Sorry, what? I just know how God is. He says he's doing good, but it gets lost in the message. What can I do for you now? Maybe a sponge bath. You think that's gonna clean your soul? What? How long are we gonna play this game? (LAUGHING) Oh, I knew this was just too good to be true. You've come for me, finally. And looking like her. What kind of a sick joke is that? Oh, I thought it was a nice touch, don't you think? So, how does this end? It doesn't, as long as you live. But you can't play this out for too much longer. The end doesn't change. I will not die without her. Not your choice. Time is almost up. Come on now, Phillip. Let's end this little charade. If you do, I promise I'll be a little bit easier on you. (LAUGHING) Easy? How do you make Hell easier? Besides, you are not the man that I made this deal with. No, but we're under new management. Daddy handed all of his duties over to me. I'm the one who's in charge now. And I say if we clean this mess up today, I can grant you a small reprieve. Can you put me with her? Can you take me to my Joanne? No. I've changed. I've been good. I made amends. You think finding a good woman like Joanne and following her lead will clean the stains from your soul? You are an evil old man. I've read the file. I just want to be with her. She's in Heaven. That's not where you're going. I'm gonna do some laundry. You think about it. You're very condescending about this! I learned to kill in war. They thought I would stop when I came back. You. You people, you created me! War unleashed the monster, but it was always there. She changed me. I'm a different person now. I need the answer. Not without her. Again, I need the answer. If I can't go to her, then you bring her to me. You want your wife dragged out of the bliss of Heaven to rot for eternity in Hell with you? Yes. (CHUCKLES) Yes. Yes! There's the old evil man I know. Deal. (LAUGHS) Thank you. I'm ready now. INVESTIGATOR: Detective, give me a hand with this. Oh, fuck. What a mess. Did you find anything? Still processing. (TENSE MUSIC) Hey, hand me those tweezers. What do we got here? Aha. Open the baggie. Let me see. Aw, shit. Detective Carson. What is it? Look. Lilith? Joanne's waiting for you. (LILITH GRUNTING) (OMINOUS MUSIC) (LAUGHING) (GROWLS) (LAUGHING) You look so tense. Are you married, Detective? I was married once and he was a lot like you, so tense and always so pious. Demons get married? Ha, I doubt that. She's talking about the first man, Adam. First man. Before Eve there was her. And I taught him how to enjoy life. I'm an excellent teacher. I can teach you. What do we do now? We're in uncharted territory. I could try a few things, but I don't know. CARSON: Black magic? No. The holy water from the church is purely ceremonial. Real holy water has the blood of a chosen priest and prayers from God. It's not gonna work. We'll see about that. Oh, yeah. (GRUNTING) Oh, yeah. Oh, what is that, some shit from the Old Testament? Rough, I like it rough. That limbless dumb fuck could've told you that. Quiet, demon child! (GRUNTS) I wanna show you how rough I like it. (LAUGHING) (GROWLS) (WOMAN MOANING) Couldn't you at least wait till I was gone? MAN: Madison, Maddie. Please, stop, don't. You said you were getting help. It's been really stressful at work lately. It was just release. Are you seeing her again? No. No, I'm not seeing... I promised you. Huh. I'm going to the Bible retreat. Sue's picking me up. I'll be back in three days. That religion shit isn't helping us out. We need to work on each other. That religion shit was there for me when you weren't. Come with me, please? Meet me there. Go have fun at your retreat. Just when you talk to God, can you put in a good word for me? What did you think was gonna happen? She comes in, finds you whacking off, and joins in? (MAN LAUGHING) I gotta admit, that would be fucking nice. She's so fucking vanilla, dude. Think of it from her perspective. This issue that both of you say was in your past and you bring it back up? Ladies and gentlemen, I present to you my living and breathing conscience. You know I'm right. I'll have to agree with him on this. You fucked up. Really? You, too? Hey, you're trying to build trust in your marriage. Anal porn doesn't help. (MAN LAUGHS) If the angel and the demon on your shoulders are both agreeing, you need to start listening. We need more beers? Yeah. Yeah, we need more beers, man. Yeah, angel. Go get us some more fucking beers, please. Jesus Christ. What the fuck were you thinking? Like you're one to talk. Yeah, I fuck around, but you don't front yourself off. Come on, how many times have I been caught, huh? Yeah. All right, we're gonna do what we're gonna do. Don't cause yourself any needless headaches. Were you seriously watching anal porn? I was, I was. And it was just getting to the gushy part before she walked in. (BOTH LAUGH) Okay, look. We're gonna have to change your MO up, man. All right? Take it from a serial cheater, all right? I got this number. Call this girl. She'll take you places. She's a freak. I had to tell her to hold back. A call girl? No, man. I don't need to spend money to get a girl, thank you. No, no, no, no. It's not like that, man. Trust me, all right? Look, just call the number, all right? (TENSE MUSIC) (SIGHS) (DOORBELL RINGS) Are you the girl? I am. Are you the guy? I am. Darren. Lilith. So, where do we start? Offer me a drink. Yeah, yeah. Yeah. You had a friend who came and saw me. Yep, Brian. Older guy, probably a little fat. Yes, I remember. He wasn't the right one. DARREN: The right one? I'm looking for a special man. Are you my special man? I get bored so easily. Yeah. Yeah, I'm your special man. In fact, when I'm done with you, you're gonna want to pay me. (BREATHING HEAVILY) My way. Uh, uh, uh. Where is the bedroom, darling? Don't you worry about that. Let me show you how it's done. (CHUCKLES) I'll show you special. (MOANS) (GRUNTING) (MOANING) (BREATHING DEEPLY) Is that special enough for you? Well, I'm famished. Fuck. Hey, Lilith! You hungry? I got some ice cream! No, my wife would be pissed about that. How about some taquitos? I can heat up the oven! No? (GROWLING) Diet Coke? My turn. DARREN: Shit. What's wrong? Nothing, nothing. Nothing's wrong. You ready for round two? Yeah. LILITH: My turn. What are you doing? Pain is pleasure, darling. Is this what you want? DARREN: Yeah. Is pain and pleasure what you want? Do you remember the young woman who threatened to out you to your wife? DARREN: What? (TENSE MUSIC) (GROWLING) (DARREN YELLS) Time to pay. DARREN: No, no! (GROWLING) I'm sorry, but I'm gonna have to ask you a few questions. Ma'am? Do you know who he was with? Do you have any idea what's going on here? I told him to come with me. He told me he was done with other girls. He was supposed to pick me up from the airport, but he didn't show. I got an Uber home, I was angry. I thought he was with another woman. What woman? Any woman he can get his hands on. I walked into the house and it was quiet, too quiet. I called out for him and nothing. I walked toward the bedroom. (TENSE MUSIC) (GASPING) My husband suffered from emptiness. His lust is what he wanted. Did you do this? No. I tried to save him. He got what he deserved. He gave into his sins. I told him. I told him. Oh, Christ. I've never seen anything like this. Did you find all the missing body parts yet? Still looking for his tongue and his penis. Jesus. Hey, Ryan. Check this out. (CAMERA SHUTTER CLICKING) Lilith. I can keep punishing her, but I can't kick her out of that body. What else can we do? I'm thinking we gotta think of some type of permanent punishment. Can she be moved? Yes. What did you have in mind? This building is being demolished. There's an old grease tank in the ground. We could put her in there. Trapped here forever. I like that. That could work. One way or another, I will make you pay. You know, I must say I'm very impressed. You've made my life more difficult than anyone in a long time. I'll take that as a compliment. You know what, Detective? You know what your problem is? You don't know how to play this cat and mouse game. Because if you did, you wouldn't be heading down that road. Enjoy your hole. I'm gonna go check out that grease tank. Okay. Hurry back. Hey, Detective. How many criminals have you punished? Not as many as me. I'm a better judge, jury, and executioner than your system will ever be. (GASPING) (UPTEMPO MUSIC) WOMAN: Hey, thanks for stopping. Sure. Car trouble? Yeah, she stalled on me and I can't get her to start back up again. Oh. And I've got this job interview today in Stone City. I don't think I'm gonna make it. (MAN CHUCKLES) Just not my day. Well, um... Um. I'm Melissa. Melissa, that's a lovely name. Thank you. Well, Melissa, it's your lucky day. I know a little about cars. Get you back on the road in no time. Oh, my god. That'd be amazing. Thank you so much. Of course. Well, where would we be without the kindness of strangers, huh? Oh, thank you so much. Sure, let's take a look. Okay. Yeah, I can already tell that it could be the rocker... Oh, boy. Yeah, look at that. I can tell. Oh, boy, that's no good. What's wrong with it? Um, well, it's... A lot of things wrong, but it's definitely... It's definitely the alternator. The alternator? Shit. Yeah. Huh. All right, I'll tell you what. I do have some jumper cables in the trunk of my car. Why don't you go and get those for me, all right? And I'll get this thing all set up for you, okay? Okay, yeah. All right, sure. Um, mister? Uh, Frank. MELISSA: Keys. Keys, right. (CHUCKLES) Here you go. Button right there. There you go. - Thanks. - Welcome. (GASPS) (TENSE MUSIC) Shh, shh, shh. It's okay, it's okay. Shh, shh. It's okay. It's okay, it's okay. Shh, shh, shh. That's a good girl. That's a good girl. Shh, shh, shh. Shh, shh, shh. It's okay, it's okay. (TENSE MUSIC) Well. (DRILL WHIRRING) (WHISTLING) Our Father who art in heaven, hallowed be thy name. No, no, no, no, no, no. No God here. Only me. You know what? I really don't think you're gonna make it to that job interview. (DRILL WHIRRING) Please. Please, please. Please, don't hurt me. Don't kill me, please. I'll do anything. I'll do anything you say. I swear I will. I'll do anything you say. I'm sure you will. Please. I have a daughter. She's waiting for me at home, please. And you're willing to trade her life for yours? What kind of a mother would do such a thing? (DRILL WHIRRING) You're mine. You're mine only. (DRILL WHIRRING) Why are you crying? I haven't even done anything. (DRILL WHIRRING) Kiss me. You heard me, just kiss me. If you kiss me, I just might consider letting you go. Oh, that was good. That was good. But I didn't tell you to kiss me on the lips. Now, if you even think of biting, I'm gonna rip off your jaw. Let's have some fun. No, no! (BLOOD SPLATTERS) (CHUCKLES) (GASPING) (YELLING) Should we go up here by the knee or down here by the ankle? Hmm. Well, Melissa, it has been fun. I will certainly miss you. Thank you. (KNOCKING ON DOOR) Did you order a pizza? (LAUGHING) Pizza. All right. (KNOCKING ON DOOR) Lord love a duck. Saved by the bell, hmm? Come on. Sorry, I know. Yeah, just go ahead and have a seat, all right? Let me get you a towel, right? Um, I didn't mean to disturb you. I just wanted to know if I could use your phone. Oh, um... Phone's not hooked up yet and there's no cell service, so. Well, maybe you could give me a ride into town? If you don't mind. Uh. Here you go. (TENSE MUSIC) Listen, um... Do you want something to drink like a coffee or tea? Stove's not working, but I can get you a coffee. Yeah, coffee'd be great, actually. I don't want you to go to any trouble or anything. Oh, no, no, no, no. No, it's no trouble. Listen, let me get your coffee and, um... You just keep drying yourself. Bless your heart. (TENSE MUSIC) Okay. Here's your coffee. Looks like the storm's clearing up. GIRL: So, what do you do here? Do you live alone? Renovations. A lot of painting, a lot of drywall. That's it. (LAUGHS) Cheers. Mm. Wow, it's pretty good. Only the best. So, tell me a little about yourself. What are you doing out here so late at night right in the middle of nowhere? Oh, believe it or not, I had a date. Well, long story short, it didn't go very well. So, I decided to take a long drive out of town to clear my head. You're really far from the city. Yeah. I guess I got kind of carried away, huh? FRANK: Yeah. (laughs) (COUGHS) You okay? Yeah, yeah. Just a little warm. I think I'm just gonna get a water. Whoa. Something wrong? It's just. (GRUNTING) How did you... How did you... Wait, wait. You know, I never got to... I never got to formally introduce myself. I'm Lilith. What the fuck? What the fuck? You've been really busy, Frank. So many lost, beautiful souls. Lost to violence. Did you honestly think you were gonna get away with it? There weren't any consequences? Did you feel any guilt at all? Huh? Guilt? Fuck you, bitch. You have no idea what I'm capable of. In this moment, nothing. I'll kill you, just like all the rest of 'em. I'm not scared of you. (YELLS) How about now? Fuck off, fuck off, fuck off. Oh, my god, oh, my god, oh, my god, oh, my god. Oh, my god, oh, my god, oh, my god, oh, my god, oh, my god, oh, my go, oh, my god. Frank. Frank, there's no god here, Frank. Just me. (FRANK YELLS) What do you want from me? I'm here to collect, Frank. No, no. Please, don't. Please, don't. Please, don't. Oh, God. Did the girls beg like you? (FRANK SOBBING) Begging? I mean, did you show them any mercy? Any compassion, Frank? Please. I couldn't control myself. I'm a weak man. You're fucking pathetic. (CLATTERING) No, you stay back. I'll fucking kill you. I will fucking kill you. I will fucking kill you. (YELLING) (DRILL WHIRRING) (COUGHS) (DRILL WHIRRING) (YELLING) (GROWLING) It's over. Get out. Get out. (TENSE MUSIC) You're a fraud. You don't believe any of this at all. FATHER: I've doubted at times, but you have made me a believer. You don't have any faith. No, it's all greed. And the only reason you're trapping me is so that you can wear that pointy hat one day. I don't wanna kill you. I wanna make you suffer. And I'll kill everyone you care for. The congregation, the priests. And then I'll go after your niece and nephew Alex and Catherine. With every vile thing you say, you fill my heart with God's righteousness. I will enjoy locking you away forever. You broke the seal. (TENSE MUSIC) (GASPING) His praying was getting on my nerves. CARSON: Lilith? LILITH: And you believed I would allow you to capture me? (SUSPENSEFUL MUSIC) The cat plays with the mouse and the mouse keeps moving forward thinking it can escape, but it's always futile. The cat is simply deciding when. We are all Lilith.
