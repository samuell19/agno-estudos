[Heart beating] Where to? I don't know. Galveston maybe, unless I decide to look somewhere else. Ain't no getting back on if you do. Well, I guess I'll just have to hitch it if I want to go somewhere else. [Children screaming, laughing] So sorry. [Man] Another day, another bus, moving on down the road. I don't know where I'm going or why I'm here, but i... I do know where I came from, where it all started. My mother was the most beautiful woman in the world, not white trash from the wrong side of the tracks, as some folks would have it. To me she was a vision in her white sun dress, gliding like a fluffy cloud over the earth. My daddy wasn't there. I never knew why. I did know that we were poor and lived in a rundown neighborhood, but poor people stuck together back then. I love you, baby. No matter what happened, I was sure it wouldn't touch US. She was blessed. She was an angel, my angel. I love you, mama. [Man singing] ♪ I'm comin', I'm comin' ♪ I'm comin' home, yeah! ♪ Home ♪ whoo, comin' home, y'all [man] I'm looking for Leroy. You're talking to him. Leroy, the sign outside says that you're looking for a bartender. You interested? I guess it all depends on how much you're paying. 10.50 an hour plus tips. Ain't bad money, but I reckon you'll earn it. Sold. Got yourself a bartender. Where you from? Oh, here and there, round about. Like the looks of your place, but don't worry. I'm legal. I got a social security card, everything. Nobody's trying to track me down. You're Leroy Jackson. [Chuckles] Yeah. You used to play with fats domino years back. Yeah, fats and little Richard. Last couple years with James brown till he got busted. I gotta tell you, it's an honor. Yeah. Have a seat. I've always been a big blues fan, tried to follow John Lee hooker, howlin' wolf. Fella that owned the place where I was raised was a big bill broonzy fan, and I guess some of that rubbed off on me. Big bill. You spending the day lazyin' and chewin' the fat, or are you gonna check those books like I've been telling you? Oh, baby, come on. This is, uh, what did you say your name was? Sam. Sam doonby. Pleased to meet you, ma'am. Sam's starting tonight. He's got a good feel for the blues. I hope he doesn't have a feel for thieving, like that last drifter you had pouring drinks. I'm not a thief. I promise you I will deliver an honest night's work for an honest night's pay. Well, since we're being honest, I might as well make out them tax returns you're talking about. Thank you. Be here at 8:00. Yes, sir. Where you staying? I just got off the bus. I don't really know... The town's full. This is county fair Saturday, and both motels have no vacancy signs up. You know, we got a storehouse out back with a bed in it. It ain't much but you can get your head down till you find something else. Well, thank you. [Chickens clucking] This place reminds me of my home town, a dusty little storeroom in a sleepy little backwater. Come here. Come on. I say, I say, look at me when I'm talking to you, boy. Life was hard back then. My mother did what she could to patch together a life for US. She always had dignity, but she did what she had to do. At least that's the way I saw it. Hey there. Where's Loretta? She ain't here tonight, Lucy-Mae. Her momma's sick, and she gotta be with her. [Man] Brother, how about a little service over here? Just hold up a minute. I'll be right with you.

Apart from driving expensive cars and drinking expensive drinks, what does Laura reaper like to do? I like to develop other expensive tastes. I live in this expensive house. And, oh, you see, my dad's this top gynecologist. Well, he spoils me real bad. You like that? Being spoiled? Sure. Why not? Sure, why not? Must be nice. I sense a hint of disapproval. No. No, no, no, i'm-I'm a lowly bartender in a small town just trying to make an honest buck, ma'am. You should stay. I'll take that under consideration. Where are you staying? Oh, well, right now I'm staying out back. With the chickens? Thelma, Louise, and colonel krisp. Oh. Okay. Okay. Cheers to the chickens. You are one thirsty girl. I haven't got far to go. Be careful, okay? Are you lecturing me, Mr. Doonby? Because if you are, I'd be very disappointed. You're far too cute to be pompous. I'll see you tomorrow? Maybe. Or maybe not. Well, in that case, maybe I will keep my eye on that door. Uh, good night, Sam doonby. Good night, Laura reaper. [Chuckles] It's not bad for a first night's work. Huh, Randy? Hm? I never seem to have any problem getting a hold of enough money to scrape by, but it was a different story for Lucy-Mae. She was a single mother, and that was tough. She was always trying to better herself, but for a poor woman in the south in the '60s, the only sure way was with a man. Hi, Lucy-Mae. You want some lemonade? I ain't got time for that right now. I need you to do me a favor. You've got to watch Sam for me tonight. You just gotta. No way I can help you out tonight, honey. Mom's down with a fever. It's only for a couple of hours. I got little Jasmine over there right now, but she can't stay. Jasmine? Mrs. Lee's daughter? She's just a itty-bitty kid herself. She's 10. [Sighs] Anyways. Brad's over at the Jack o'diamonds motel, and he's only here tonight, and I ain't seen him in six whole weeks. Tell you, I can't. Momma's real sick this time, and the doctor's coming over. And ain't it about time you told that boy about Sam? I mean, you've been seeing him on and off for at least a year. On and off's about right. Once a month on his journey cycle. He'd go crazy. He'd run like a loon with his pants on fire if he knew I had a kid. Reckons that's the trouble with his marriage. Huh? Carla... that's his wife. She keeps having kids like shelling peas. She don't know how to look after herself. Brad says she ain't got time for him no more. Well, from what you've been telling me, sounds like she's got time for him at least once a year. Anyway, what's this about her not being able to keep after herself, huh? If you so smart, honey baby, why did you get Sam in the first place. Hm? I don't have to take this. Are you going to help me out or what? Maybe tomorrow. Tomorrow is too late. I just hope I ain't as mean to you when you need a favor. That's all I've got to say, Loretta. Lucy-Mae. [Man] Coffee smells good. What are you doing here? The clinic was a little quiet this morning, and I got a half hour to kill before I have to go to the hospital. Hey, rock. How long you been trying to get that food down little rock there? Best part of an hour, Dr. Cyrus. He don't like lamb and vegetables. Why don't you give him something else? Kid's gotta eat. Maybe t-bone on the rare side if I cut it up a bit for him. Oh, now you're talking. Yeah. How about that? Huh, rock? Think he's losing weight? He's just fine. It's a phase. You're a gynecologist, not a pediatrician. You just getting up? It's nearly 11:30. Don't be such a bear, daddy. Morning, rocky. Morning, Irma. Time did you get home last night? Must've been after 3:00. It was after 3:00. It's always after 3:00 when I go to Leroy's. Sounds like you had a good time. I do not think that is the kind of place where a young girl should be out by herself. I'm not a young girl anymore, daddy. Music was awesome. Your daddy's always going to worry, especially after what happened. You don't have to make apologies for me. I just don't want history to repeat itself. That's all. I'm sorry about rock. I mean, he was my brother, you know. I mean, I just don't know why myself coming home early is going to be able to bring him or Tracy back. He was drinking and driving. Do we have to go over this again? I mean, it was the other guy who had the blowout, dad. There was nothing that rock could've done. We don't know that. Daddy, I'm sorry. You've gotta let go. It's almost been a year now. You gotta let me get on with my life. I'm not your little girl anymore. You will always... For you. You will always be my little girl, and I will always get on your case if I feel I have to. So who was at the club last night? Oh, you know, the usual suspects... Jack from the mailbox store. Tony, of course. Ah, Tony. I like him. He's a sweet boy. Oh, and there was this cute guy tending bar. Probably a no-good drifter. A no-good drifter? Maybe a wandering samaritan come to bring love and peace to US all. [Laughs] All our actions carry a legacy. People act desperately without thinking about the consequences. Did you leave your little boy alone again? He ain't alone, and I don't see what that's got to do with you anyways, Nancy. I'll tell you what it's got to do with me, Lucy-Mae. I brought my children up god fearing by setting them a good example, unlike some folks I know. Good example, huh? What happened to Mr. Thurber, then? Why he run off? That was his decision. He had that same devil's curse you have. What curse would that be? That evil urge to laugh? To dance? To feel alive? To see something outside of Parker county? You should have thought of that before. Before I made one tiny mistake? Tiny mistake? Is that how you look at that child of yours? Children are a miracle. A gift from god. It's your duty to look after 'em good. You got responsibilities, girl. Well, maybe I have. But I'll make my own decisions, Nancy. Sure don't need any help from you. Well, well. Kamikaze, a b-52, and two Boston bullets. How you feeling today? Bombed out. I'll bet you are. Can I sit here? Sure. Uh, I'd like a cup of coffee, please, with cream, honey, and a big ol' glass of ice water. Lemon in that? Oh, sue, can you split a 20 for me? Oh, yeah. Let me see. Oh, hi. Hey. I have to give it to someone in my class. Class? Yeah. I teach an aerobics class. Didn't I tell you that? No, you didn't really tell me much of anything. Well, then I think you need to buy me a coffee. I would love to buy you coffee. Actually, make it a cappuccino with a sweet'n low. All right, I'll be right back. Okay. Uh, make that two cappuccinos... One with sweet'n low and one with honey, and two big ol' glasses of ice water. Sure thing. Thanks. All right. I can definitely use this. Tell me something, though, other than aerobics classes and drinking over at Leroy's, what do you actually like to do? Are you getting on my case again? Mm. Little bit. I don't know. I just really like to party. See, my daddy, he's well off. He's this... Top gynecologist. Yeah, I know. I told you? Yeah. My gosh. Well, he's really successful, and so he sent me to lucerne, and that's where I went to become a dancer. It was either that or painting, and started to get into dancing. Sounds like fun. Up until that accident that I had. Accident? Oh, yeah. I was skiing and I went down this hill, and ended up twisting my right leg, and, well, it just started to calcify under my kneecaps, and then I just had to stop. You're painting now? Oh. Yeah, not anymore. I haven't done that for years. That's too bad. So tell me, Mr. Doonby, what's your story? Oh, me, I'm just a bartender who travels around a lot and doesn't like to stay in one place for very long, because he figures a moving target's harder to hit. But I'm nobody, really. Well, what about your future? My future is the next second, Laura. Your future is the next second. See? There it went. [Whistles] Did you miss that? I think I did. I figure that we're supposed to enjoy every moment and try to make a difference. That's the point. It just seems like there's something more to your story. No, no, there's no... No deep, dark secrets here. Fact, if you really get to know me better, I think you'd find out that I was really quite boring. [Laughs] And that, Mr. Doonby, I would find very disappointing. Would you excuse me for just a minute? Okay. Hey, buddy, can you tell me where the library is? I thought it used to be... So let's go and find where you keep that lousy money. Hey, hey, hey. Take it easy, pal. Who the hell are you, man? You take it easy, pal. And back off! I said back off, and step away from the door. You understand me? Or I will kill him. I'm not moving. I'm not gonna tell you twice. Come on. You tell me about where that money is. Where is it? I told you. It's in there. It's not that much. We banked it already. He's telling you the truth. What is this? Man, where's the rest? This is it? I told you I was gonna kill you. Hey, hey, I work here. He's telling you the truth. Don't tell me what to do! Understand? Now what are you gonna do about it, huh? Huh? You hear me? What are you doing? Come on in here. I'm gonna show you how I'm gonna blast this piece of black trash! No! Leroy! No! [Speaks Spanish] Leroy. Please... [Tires screech, horns honking] I heard the shooting, and I just ran right in. Sit down. Sit down. I was in the kitchen, and I heard something. And you never think it's gonna happen to you. It's lucky you were here, Sam. Thanks. It's all right. You gonna be okay? Yeah, yeah. Here, baby, let me look. My hearing's coming back now. Oh, baby. Love you so much. Ah. Get me a beer, woman. [Laughter] You could dry up and die in this place. How did you know? Uh, i... i don't know. Things just didn't seem right, I guess. Are you gonna call the police? No. No. No, we shouldn't do that. I don't need any cop cars parked outside. It's bad for business. Is that okay with you, Sam? Yeah. I'm with you right there 100%, Leroy. Hey, Duane. Another beer? Uh, maybe not. I got a long haul tomorrow. Arch? Rookie. At your age, man, you should be sticking to delivery vans and stay away from them dump trucks. And let me tell you, Duane, you better keep an eye on those times. Your permit get yanked, it's not gonna be worth the extra cash. Well, you play guitar as well as you do everything else, Sam? Oh, I fiddle around with it a little bit. You got that right. Baby. I'm just kidding. Are you gonna show US some of that fiddlin' around? No, no, no, no. Uh-uh. Oh, no, no, no. I can't play that guitar. That's Woody Guthrie's guitar. Oh, he won't mind. He ain't been here in months. Yeah, come on, Sam. Let them strings do the talking. Go on now. Regular Chet atkins. Show 'em what you got. [Sighs] Let's hear it. Uh...

You are a true gentleman. Where'd you learn to play like that? Oh, uh, parkerville, Louisiana. Friends of mine had a little place across the tracks, and I used to go over there. They'd pick some mean blues. Did you say, uh, parkerville, Louisiana? Yeah. Don't tell me you've heard of it. My folks are from parkerville, Louisiana. Is that right? Well, it's a small world, isn't it? It is a small world. Can we get a drink around here? Can I get two slightly dirty gin martinis? Sure. Comin' right up. I think he's kinda cute. Yeah, isn't he? That boy needs to unwind, have a little fun after work. I'll see you later. [Clattering] Aah! Easy, easy, easy. I'm so sorry. Are you okay? I saw you fall. Are you all right? I am. I think I was going crazy. I think someone was following me. I don't see anybody. Are you okay? I think it's just all that happened today. Give me your keys. I'm gonna drive you home. You can't drive. Well, thank you very much, sir Galahad. Where do you live, lady Guinevere? Well, I live on the edge. The edge of town. Get in the car. Oh. Uh, uh, uh. But first, let's, uh, let's go to Justin and Lisa's. It's after 3:00 in the morning. What is it with you and time? One glass. Then I will take you home. Now, please, get in the car. Ah. Come on. That is exactly what I've been waiting for after a hard day's work. So you're gonna come on in? No, I'm not comin' in. Why not? 'Cause I don't have a suit. Oh, I like a shyness in a man. Shows his vulnerable side. You know what? Justin did say that you needed to unwind. Oh, he did? Tell me, what exactly is it that you do, Justin? I'm a vp at commeroil and Lisa's in PR. Oh, so that makes you an oil mogul, huh? Hardly a mogul. I'm in legal affairs. Sounds slippery. You're one mysterious guy, Sam. I've never heard Laura talk so much about somebody and tell US so little. I was trying to be cool. Where'd you say you were from? I didn't say, Justin. Yes, you did. You said you were from parkerville, Louisiana. Same as my folks. What'd you do there? Grew up, mostly. What did you do after that? I went to karamoja. Where? Where? Karamoja. It's in Uganda. I was in the peace corps. Oh. Peace corps, huh? Yeah. You've heard of it? Yeah. All the guys I knew that went into that were some kind of idealistic pinko. Well, I guess if going to a foreign country and trying to make sure that a bunch of children do not starve to death makes you an idealistic pinko, then I'm an idealistic pinko, aren't I? Well, anyway, Africa's way too hot and smelly for me. I was doing a marketing degree at ut. Oh, good for you, Justin. Okay. Let's talk about something else. Yes. I'm a little hungry. Got anything to eat around here? Okay, Princess. Come on. You're home. Come on. I'm not talking to you. Really? Why not? 'Cause you humiliated me in front of my friends. You didn't need any help to do that. You did fine on your own. Now come on. Where's my dress? Right here. How did you know where I live? There was a piece of paper inside your purse. You went in my purse? How dare you? I don't even know you. Hey, hey, hey, hey. Shh. Shh. I didn't take anything. And besides, it looked like you knew me pretty well back at the hot tub. Yeah. Yeah, yeah. Now come on. Let's go inside. And be quiet. You're gonna wake up the neighbors. Well, don't tell me what to do. That's my car. That's my car. That's my house! Shh, shh. This is my stupid... It's my... Stupid town. Well, then don't wake the stupid neighbors. Here. Take these. Inside. And go to sleep. By the way, thanks a lot, Sam. Thanks for getting me home. Thanks for making me safe. Thanks for everything, Sam. Thanks for a wonderful evening. Blah, blah, blah, blah. Shut it. Ugh. Goodnight, Mrs. Kravitz! [Man] Laura. Hi, dad. You bring the morning paper? That's all I need. What are you doing up? Rockwell junior here has about as much regard for sensible hours as you do. Woke up crying. Mm. Well, where's Irma? I thought that's what you paid her for. Hey, Dr. Reaper. I'm sorry. Let me take him. All right. Bye-bye, champ. You sleep now, sweetheart. Bye-bye. Night, rocky. Mm. Night, dad. Where are your clothes? Right here. I was hot tubbing at Lisa's. I told you not to drink and drive. I wasn't drinking and driving, dad. In fact, a gentleman drove me home. Oh, yeah, maybe you wouldn't be happy about him. He was that no good drifter from Leroy's you told me about. We need to talk. Sit down. Now. What is it with you, young lady? I worry myself sick every night about you. I never asked you to. I have a position in this town. Oh, is that what this is about? Your position? That's not what I mean. It's not, dad? I have given you everything. And you're wasting your life away. Well, I don't think so. Well, I know so. You like to live life on the edge. You go to all the wrong places with all the wrong people. You're like a moth to a fire. You have never even met my friends. Well, I don't need to. I'm looking at the results. You come home drunk most nights. Don't have any ambition. Don't have any goals. Sleep away half the day. That's not fair. I have my aerobics classes. Oh, right. Yes. Synchronized push-ups. Is that why I sent you to the best art schools in Europe? And since you've come back, have you as much as picked up a brush or even a pencil? I'm not very good at it. Oh, that's bull and you know it. And all your art teachers say you're great. You just don't have the guts. And it's the same with your dancing. No pain, no gain. Do you understand that concept? I had an injury! Oh, yeah, right, like margot fonteyn didn't work her way back from an injury. I don't think so. Well, she did, young lady. She just gritted her teeth and worked right back up to the top of that mountain. But you, you... [Sighs] You don't even make it to the foothills. Well, I'm glad that we had this out. 'Cause now I know how you feel about me. It's about time... Look, look, look, stop. You know I think the world about you. You know that. You're everything to me, especially now. I mean, haven't I given you everything? No. Doesn't it ever occur to you, daddy? That's the problem. Well, what more do you want from me? I want space. I just need space.

How about I put on my pants and I make you some coffee. Why don't we do that? Okay. Oh, this is something else. You like it? Like it? This is amazing. How did you manage... Oh, a hammer, nails, lick of paint. Where... where's this? That is Uganda. I was there helping to plant crops. Was that, like, one of your moments of making a difference? Yeah, it was.

I used to have one when I was a kid, and I would cringe a year later when I read that. Does it include all of the dark secrets you told me that don't exist? Not so dark. No? What about all the mysterious past of Sam doonby? Guard it with your life. I do. I guard it with my life, in fact it will self destruct if any unauthorized personnel even touches it. Oh, yeah? Look at that. Touch. Do you want some coffee or not? Sure, I'll have some coffee. Okay. You know, nothing surprises me about you. You just seem to think of everything. Oh, yeah? I'm out of coffee. Out of coffee? Why does that make me feel so much better? I have no idea. [Laughs] Come on. Let me take you to the store. Look like you're fit to hit the hay, Duane. Long trip today? Just up to longview and back. That's near 450 miles. Yeah, well, I had an early start this morning. You okay? All right, man. Oh. Sorry. Hey, Irma. Hey. I didn't know you were coming down here this morning. Yeah, it's a nice day today. Mrs. Reaper needed some lotion and all, so I thought I'd take Rockwell for a walk. That's good. I wanted to introduce you to my friend Sam. Sam, this is Irma. She's our nanny. Hi. Nice to meet you. And this is little baby Rockwell, I was telling you about. Hey, rock. Isn't he cute? Hello. What's going on? How are you? [Growls] [Growls] [Honking horn] Think it's officially time I say thank you. It was nothing. But my dad came down really hard on Irma. Why would he do that? She couldn't help that the truck couldn't stop. I know, but you don't know Cyrus reaper. It's like if something happens, he has to figure out who's responsible and just make sure all the loose ends are tied. That's just the way he is, but you get to see that for yourself tomorrow. I do? Mm-hmm. You're coming round for dinner. I am? Yes, you are. You've got the official invitation. Sounds more like a subpoena. No, it's not like that. He just wants to meet you, thank you personally. The no-good drifter? You heard me say that. Yeah. I heard that. But I can't say as I blame him. I think I would act exactly the same way if I had a daughter like you. You cold? Here. I... I just get chilly when I'm tense. Tense? Now? Why? Because I think I'm falling in love with you, Mr. Doonby. And I don't want to make a fool out of myself. Well, I fell in love with you the first moment I saw you out of that bus window. You were driving this car, wearing those sunglasses. Your hair was blowing in the wind. Sounds like a sunsilk ad. What about you and Jolene? What about me and Jolene? Mm-hmm. What about me and Jolene? Well, I know that she likes you, and I just... And I like pizza. So what? [Laughs] What? I just... I just don't know where I stand. You don't know where you stand? No, i... I'm just... My mind goes blank. And if there's something going on between Jolene and you, I just want to know so I can just... Shh, shh, shh, shh... Listen to me. There is nothing going on between Jolene and me. That's the truth. I want you, just you. That's it. Irma? Yes. Napkin on the left. Okay. Is the escargot mousse in the fridge? It has to be perfectly chilled. Yes. That's the third time you've asked me. And I put the cabernet out to let it breathe. And you didn't ask me to do that at all. Oh, good girl. What time is it? It's 10 after 8. Oh, my, he's going to be here any minute. Mom, stop panicking. Sam's real laid back. Would you get my hook? Actually, I like to have everything organized. I know you do. No matter who it is. All right. Now, where's your father? He's in the shower. I still hear the water running. He came late from the clinic. He'll be here in a few minutes. [Cell phone dings] Is that Sam? Is he going to be late? No. [Doorbell rings] Actually he's here right now. Oh. Hi. Ta-da. Oh, they're so beautiful. Are they for me? No. What? [Both laughing] Hey. Hi. Sam, this is my mother. Well, hello, Mrs. Reaper. Thank you very, very much for the invitation. Oh, how'd you know red roses were my favorite? Irma. Hello. Hi. Please. Sam, what would you like to drink? Some water would be great. Water, please. Irma, would you be able to get Sam some water. I'll have a dry Martini. Coming right up. So how did you get this evening off, Sam? Oh, Leroy's always pretty good about that, especially if it's not the weekend. And next weekend Sam plays at antones. Very nice. You don't know? Antones is a very successful venue. It's a great break. Oh, I'm an opening act. I'm nobody, really. And it's going to take a whole lot of work before I'm ready to get out there on that stage. Are you a little nervous? No. No, I'm absolutely terrified. An honest man. How refreshing. Sam's very talented, and he has no reason to be nervous. Oh, don't listen to her. Don't listen to her. She's just my biggest fan. That's all. There you go. Sam. Thank you. Thank you, Irma. Uh-uh, uh, uh. I'm sorry. Let's have a toast to success. And to you, Sam. Thank you for saving my grandbaby. I just... I happen to be there. I think anybody would've done the same thing. Oh, a modest man, too. [Cyrus] Oh, I need this. I am as parched as a desert. Mm. Nice to meet you, Sam. I'm sorry, I was a little late from work, but here now and... Um... [Clears throat] I, uh... Well, I just want to thank you as a family for what you did yesterday. I mean, if you hadn't been there, god knows what would've happened. Sam, are you okay? Ms. Reaper, I really don't feel all that good. It's probably just verves. They're silly little things, nerves. Yeah, about dinner. Don't you worry. You're fine. There'll be other nights, many other nights. Well, why don't you let me have a look at you? Maybe I can... no, no, no, no. Maybe I can... No, no, no, don't... Sam, can you stand still? Let me have a look at... Don't... touch me. What is wrong with him? I will... Sam! [Chuckles] Am I the only sane person in this house? Sam. Sam. Sam, do you want to tell me what just happened in there? Nothing, nothing. Nothing? Honey, you look like you've seen a ghost. Maybe I have. What? Mine. Have you gone completely wacko? I think... I think maybe I have. Listen, I'm going to get my car, and I'm going to take you home right now. No, no, no, no. I... I'll see you tomorrow. Sam. [Lucy-Mae] I gotta go back. I gotta go back. You gotta do what? Sam. I gotta see my little boy. I gotta see my baby. What? You got a baby, and you didn't tell me? Don't yell at me. I can't believe... I left my kids for you. For you! I don't care what you say. You take me back to my kids. Right now! If that's what you want. [Horn honking] [Crashes, glass shattering] Your daddy isn't the only one who wants to see you protected, and I still know people in this town, so we're going to find out what we can uncover about him. Yeah, well, I feel like a cheap sneak. Mrs. Thurber? Nancy? I was important in this town, you know. I was the mayor. Sure you were. I was in the choir. Sam doonby. Do you remember a boy named Sam doonby? Doonby. Doonby. I remember a woman by the name of doonby, that the cheap little floozy. Do you remember her first name? Lily... Lucy... Lucy-Mae, that's what it was. Trash. Trash. Do you know what happened to her? She up and left right after. Right after... Right after what? Are you Lucy? Did Lucy-Mae have a boy named Sam? She had lots of boys. She got her just desserts for what she done. What do you mean by that? You gonna find out. You all gonna find out. You got a second chance. Take it, girl, while you can. Or you'll just be sorry. You'll all be so sorry. Mama, she's crazy, huh? I... I'm going. Laura. Mom, she's crazy. Sam never had a chance. You'll be sorry. Did she just say "Sam"? Come on. What did you mean by "Sam"? You'll be sorry. What did she mean by "Sam"? No way. Spooky, huh? Yeah, it was. Hey, girl, will you pass me those fire tongs? Yeah, sure. Here you go. Thanks, darling. You know, what about your dad? I mean, that must have been a strange evening too. Yeah, it was. Thing is, Sam won't talk about it. I don't know. I guess he'll tell me one day. He'll tell you one day? Well, that has a ring of permanence about it. Yeah, we'll see. Oh, this all looks like fun. Shame I didn't get an invite. Oh, not this time. Just Tony and me. It's his first night off in weeks. You cookin'? Oh, girl, you crazy. You know it's a guy thing when it comes to burning meat. I wouldn't be able to come tonight if I wanted to. Mm? Mm-hmm. 'Cause i'm rustling him up a treat. [Rock music playing] [Music continues in radio] Mm. You don't deserve me, Mr. Sam doonby. [Turns radio down] [Phone rings] Hope that's not you, honey, saying that you're gonna be early. You're gonna spoil everything, and I just lit the candles, and I just want this to be a special night for you. Oh, I bet you do, Laura. You do special things for lots of guys. Listen, you don't scare me, you sad degenerate. That's no way to talk to a friend. You're not my friend. I wouldn't be too sure about that. Listen, Sam will be here in just a minute. No, he won't. He's driving back from Austin. Traffic's bad, I hear. Leave me alone. What do you want from me?! [Phone beeps] [Gasps] Tony, I'm so glad it's you. Wow, what a welcome. Are you okay? Yes. Just some weird calls that scared me a bit. Did you tell Sam? No, no, I don't want him to think I'm neurotic. He's one lucky guy. Yeah, I keep telling him the same thing. So how was your dinner with Jess? Yeah, she, uh, she went to see her mother. Ooh, do you want a beer? Or I've got a cold chardonnay in the fridge. Mm-hmm. All right, which is it? A beer or wine? Beer'll be just fine. All right. So, uh, what did you want to talk about? You wanna give me some space? You wanna give me some room? Why? I'm... your friend. Friend. Oh, lord help me. So that was you? Me? Come on, Tony! The calls, the texts. What's wrong with you? Come on, Tony! What's wrong with you, huh? What is wrong with you, my pretty little small-town hooker. Oh, quit messing around! Oh, that's funny. Coming from you, huh? I see you night after night, strutting your stuff on the town. Huh? Swaying your hips this way and that, just so you can hike that teeny little skirt up just a wee bit more. You're hurting me. Let go. Tony, let go. I... i just wanted to talk. Okay. We'll talk. We'll talk. Just take it easy. No. Oh, no. Tony, no. No! What are you doing, Laura, huh? Why do you play with US like that? I wasn't playing with you. Now your little game's over, and guess who's the winner, huh? So now let's take a look at first prize, huh? [Rock music playing] [Screams] [Tony] Aah! Whoa. Hey, hey, Tony, stop. She hurt me. Now I'm gonna punish her. Hey, hey, you stay right there. What are you talking about? Okay, lover boy. Maybe I ought to just take care of you first, huh? Tony... Sam doonby. The man from... Nowhere. Come to our town, start taking over our lives, taking over our women. My women. I'm not your woman! She's not your woman. Yes, she is. She's not your woman. Tony... They're all my women. Her, Jess, that floozy behind the bar. They all belong to me. Listen to me for a second. You need help. You need serious help. Don't you start analyzing me, huh? I've had enough of you oh so smart counselors. All your hours and hours of talking, your little group therapy sessions with a bunch of weirdo losers. You know what? I showed 'em all that you're not gonna mess with me. Where was this, Tony? Tony. You know very well about New York. Did you hurt somebody in New York, Tony? Aah! Did you hurt somebody in New York, Tony? She deserved it! Like all the others. Like her! [Screams] [Squelch] [Laura crying] [Sam] It's okay. It's okay. Come on. Come on, come on, come on. It's okay. It's okay. He tried to kill me. He tried to kill me. Hey, sheriff. I'll hold onto that. Uh, did you have a good time? Getting too old for these outdoor holidays with the family, Charlie. You know they had me whitewater rafting? Well, they must just figure you don't get enough excitement down here. Well, judging from the news bulletin I saw, it appears I missed a whole lot of fun the other day. You look good on TV, Charlie. No. [Laughs] Thank you, Debbie. Now, sheriff, don't be telling him that. He's already got the fame bug. He's holding his .38 like this. I don't. Never done that a day in my life. Yes, you do. Yes, you do. Anyway. Okay, so what do we got? Well, I worked really hard on this, sir. Uh, to me, it's pretty straightforward. Uh, Tony valdini is his real name. Not modeno. He spent five years in a New York mental institution. Uh, they reckon he killed his mother. Yeah, she was a hooker. Got her... I'm sorry. Don't even know why I sat like that. Like I said, she's a woman of the night, and got herself stabbed 20 or 30 times, but they never pinned it on him. Why? Ain't that a felony in New York these days? Well, I mean, they never found the murder weapon, so they could never prove it. But he tested positive for crazy, anyway, and they sent him off to the funny farm like a shot. What the heck is he doing out? Well, sir, they let him out for the weekend, I guess, and thought he was okay, and he "r-u-n o-f-t." Well, looks like these guys in New York are gonna be answering for something. Sir. Why don't you sit down, Charlie? Can I? Oh, I appreciate that. Take a load off here. Uh, funny thing is, uh, you know, he never... He never, ever hurt his girlfriend Jessica Gordon. You know, the one got the boutique up there on main street? 'Course I know her. Yeah, 'cause I know you and I are kinda simpatico, you're probably wondering what's wrong with her, right? Tell you what I'm wondering, Charlie. Wondering who is this white knight. Sam doonby? Doonby. Yes, sir. What sorta name is doonby? Yeah. Yeah, I was wondering that. I figure, uh, Irish? Think he could be an Irish gypsy? I don't know. It's hard to tell. He ain't got a shamrock behind his ear or anything, sir. But I will say, this town was a whole heck of a lot quieter when he wasn't here. That's a fact. Where's he from? Well, he says he's from parkerville, Louisiana. Well, is he? Well, nobody up there knows anything about him. I mean, they reckon he's brought up in an orphanage, but the whole place burned down in '70, and all the records went with it. Talking about records... He's in the system? No. No, I checked. Triple checked, as a matter of fact, and, uh, fingerprints don't match up. He's never even had... As far as I can tell... So much as a speeding ticket. Social security number? Yes, sir. Yeah, it's right, uh... Somewhere in there. Well, nothing suspicious about this guy's death. No, sir. From what I was able to deduce, uh, doonby showed up almost... Almost right in time. Where can I find this man of mystery? Well, last I seen him, I believe he said he's headed over to the library. Did I ever tell you I enjoy a good book? No, sir, you did not. But I will get you one for Christmas. Or your birthday. Whichever comes first. Okay, Charlie. Well, all right then. We'll hold down the fort here. Don't make yourself comfortable. Tom! Look, I want you to check out this doonby character. You telling me my job, Cyrus? No, no. Guy just gives me the creeps, that's all. Well, you're suggesting that it wasn't self defense? No, no, he's just got this strange hold over Laura. Cyrus, I gotta tell you, you're a darn find doctor. One of the best. I'd send anyone in my family to you, 'cause I trust your judgment. Appreciate that, Tom. Okay? You're a pro. You tell me they need an op, I take your word for it. 'Cause you're the boss where medicine's concerned. Now me, my area of expertise is the law. I'm a cop, and I don't mind telling you I'm a darn fine cop. We know that. So you do your job, Cyrus, and leave me to do mine. Boy's dead, and that's a serious thing. Your Laura is alive, so whatever the story is around here, you ought to be grateful. Excuse me. 'Cause I got some work to do. Kind of... What do you think? Oh, hi, sheriff. You must be Sam doonby. Sheriff woodley. Yeah, hi. I'm Sam doonby, sheriff. What do you say we go across the road and have a little meetin'? I already talked to your deputy sheriff. I answered every question he had. Laura was there. She was a witness to my statement. Yeah, Sam saved my life. Tony was crazy, sheriff. He had a knife. What am I supposed to do? Law allows you to use reasonable force. That's quite all right. Good. So I used reasonable force. But is there some sort of a problem? Nobody knows nothin' about you, Sam. I can call you Sam? Yeah. You can call me whatever you want. Okay. You see, it's like this. When folks can't put people in their own little compartment, it makes 'em uneasy. Kinda like you are right now. I'm not uneasy sheriff. You know, we been trying to check you out, Sam. And, uh, can't find a darn thing about you. No credit rating, no listing. It's like you never existed. See, it's like this, sheriff. I already talked to your deputy. I answered every question he head. You ever been in jail somewhere? Sam, do me a favor, please, and don't leave town. I got no intention of leaving town, sheriff. That's good. Thank you. So can I go? You gonna arrest me, or what? You're free to go. Free to have a mint julep. Just don't leave town. Was so very nice meeting you, sheriff. Been nice meeting you, Sam. Come on. Bye, sheriff. Laura. Where's Sam tonight? It's only 5:30. He don't start till 7:00. Maybe you should tell him to stay home tonight. Maybe. We'll see how it goes. Why? Well, there's trouble. Police showing up. It's bad for business. Taking's been half what it should be the last two nights. Well, it's still better than it was before he came. Look, I got an errand to run. Can you manage for an hour? If we don't get trampled by the stampede. Hi, Sam. What are you doing here, Jolene? Waiting for you. You've got more than an hour before you have to be at work. Very funny. Look, you got to get out of here. This is no time to start messing around. Oh, I think it's a perfect time to start... Messing around. So why don't you take them jeans off and come on over here? What... what are you doing? Jolene. There you are, Sam. I'm right here waiting for you. I need you to put your clothes back on. Because Laura's gonna come walking through that door any minute. No, she ain't. I saw her driving over to Jess', so the way I see it, she won't be back for hours. What was it like, Sam? What was what like? Killing a guy? You ever... Killed a guy before? You're not right, Jolene. It was right over there, wasn't it? I mean, did he, uh... Scream or anything? Any blood come out of his mouth? I can't believe this. Makes me feel kinda weird, you know. I mean, I seen Tony looking at me sorta strange a few times, but lotsa guys look at me in the bar, and I never thought nothing of it. Just think, all that time he had a fantasy about cutting me up or hurting me just like he was doing to Laura, till you came by. That must have given you a buzz. I need you to leave. Now, Jolene. Come on. You reckon she led him on? I mean, why her? Not me? I don't have to stand here and listen to this. I want you to understand something, okay? Laura and I are together. Tony was touched. In the head. I did what I had to do. I didn't want to kill him. I didn't enjoy killing him. I didn't like killing him. I sure didn't get any buzz out of doing it. In fact, I pray every day that Tony was still alive. I'm not making love to you, Jolene. Not tonight. Not tomorrow. Not next week. Not ever. So I want you to get your stuff together, put your clothes on, and get out of my house. So that's it, huh? Yeah. I'm not good enough for you? Come on. I don't got a daddy that's got more money than sense. [Dress zips] I've had to fight for all I got. What's she ever had to do for herself, huh? She's never had to wash dishes or sling hash or work at hostess bars for lousy tips. No, she just drives on up in her fancy little sports car, drinking herself under the table, picking up cheapskate bar flies like you, and then she sleeps all day and does it all over again. Her and her yuppie friends. Well, I'll show you and her and her high and mighty family. You're all gonna be sorry you laughed at me. Jolene. Hey, look. Nobody laughed at you. I never laughed... Just get out of my way. [Door opens, closes] This town is full of crazy people. Dr. Reaper? Uh, yes, ma'am. I'm sorry. I just closed for the evening. I'm sorry. Um, I got a real bad pain. Right here. All right, you make an appointment, and we'll see you in the morning. Oh, please. I'm scared. I mean, are you a doctor? Yes, of course I am. But I don't have a staff available right now. I mean, if you're that bad, you go to the hospital. Please, doctor. Look, that's a long way off. I mean, can't you just check me out real quick? Look, I need a nurse present. I can't do that. Look, it'd only take a minute. And I ain't gonna tell no one. I mean, can't you just give me a break? Look, I just need to know it ain't nothing bad. All right. Come on, come on. Quickly. Come on. You fellas taking it easy tonight? Mm-hmm. Yeah. Well, if it's a waistline problem... It ain't that. Things just ain't the same around here anymore. Those cop cars parked outside have anything to do with it? Yeah, what are they doing here, anyways? Just applying a little pressure is all. Where's golden boy, anyway? He's out back in the store. You know, things were plain and simple before he came around. Sure saved your hide, didn't he, Duane? And Leroy's here. Oh, yeah? Well, maybe the situation wouldn't have happened if he weren't around. What do you mean by that? I don't know. Just a feeling's all. [Sam] Hello. Hey, gentlemen. How's it going tonight? Fine. Just fine. Well, it doesn't look like it's going fine, Archie. Let me guess. Why would that be? Is it because Jolene's not in here, so you could get a look at her butt in that tight little skirt? Is she late? She's always late. Well, she's not always an hour late. We should probably give her a call. [Phone rings] I'll bet you that's her right now. Leroy's. Yeah. Hey, hey, hey. Hang on, hang on, hang on. Sam. Yeah. It's for you. It's your own personal wild child. Hello. What? When? Well, yeah... hey. Calm down. Yeah. I'm coming down there. Right now. I'm on my way. I need some time off. Jolene's not coming in tonight. Jolene? I thought that was Laura. It was. She's down at the police station. Jolene just accused Cyrus of sexual assault. What? Huh? What are you doing in there?! Why are you lying?! What are you doing in there, huh? Okay, calm down here. Now, miss Jolene in there's real upset. Okay? She says that she went to Cyrus' clinic and... He jumped her. Tom? And she's got evidence. What kind of evidence does she say she has? She's got bruises and abrasions all over her personal and private areas. I can't believe I'm listening to this. Now Barbara Ann, I'm not jumping to any conclusions, but I think you should get an attorney for Cyrus. My dad would not rape anyone. Tom, do you know how many years you've known my husband? About as long as you've known him, Barbara Ann. Okay, can I talk to you in private for just a minute please? How'd I know you'd come by, doonby? Can... sweetheart. You got something to tell me? Go ahead. Barbara Ann, make sure she's okay. Thank you. You got anything to back this up? No wonder you didn't want miss Laura in on your conversation. Nothing happened. This used to be a nice, quiet town, till you showed up. Since then, we've had hold-ups, runaway trucks, violent death, and attempted rape. And you seem to be involved in all of it, Sam doonby. Hmm. You gotta tell me what you use for aftershave. 'Cause every woman in this town seems to have the hots for you. Jolene, I want you to know that I'm real sorry for what happened to you. Okay? I don't think any young girl should go through what you went through here. That's terrible. But I need your help with something, okay? Is this yours, honey? What if it is? Well, then you could be in a whole lot of trouble. For false accusation. Well, I ain't lyin'. Well, then what do you call it? I told you what happened. I went to the clinic and he attacked me. Why won't you believe me? Sam doonby told me that you went over there and you seduced him. Well, what about these, huh? You could have done them yourself. Okay? Now do you understand something? I'm gonna put this through forensics. We're gonna have forensics on the doctor. I ain't a liar. Then what are you? I ain't a liar. Want you back here in the morning, young lady. You've got some explaining to do. This ain't over. And you're the tramp. You wanna go? Hey, hey, hey. Sam... Sam, what did you say to her? Charlie. Yes, sir. Go get Dr. Reaper, tell him he can go home. You mean let him out of the cell? What? I thought he was a flight risk. What happened between you and Jolene? Nothing. She came onto me. That's all. Oh, and I suppose without any encouragement? No. She wanted something from me and I wouldn't give it to her. She got mad. That's it. Oh, and I can't imagine what that thing was. Oh, Laura, don't be so dumb. Dumb. Yes, that's right, I am dumb. And I have been dumb all these weeks. But what does that have to do with my dad? She set him up, okay? She set him up. She wants to get even with me, with you, with god, with the world. I don't know. I don't believe you. You can believe whatever you want, but, for the last time, there is nothing going on between Jolene and me. She's crazy. In fact, this whole town is a little crazy. What is your problem with my dad? I don't have to like the guy, okay? I... I got my reasons. They're personal reasons. I love you, I don't have to love your father. But what did he ever do to you? What has he ever... you wouldn't believe me if I told you. Now is not the time, Laura. What is that supposed to mean? [Sam moans] I don't have to stand out here in the middle of the street, in the middle of the night, and explain myself to you. You need to think about it? Think about it. I gotta run a bar, and I got a rehearsal for tomorrow. Fine.

You miss me? I was worried about you, if that's what you're talking about. You okay? Haven't been better. You've finished early tonight, haven't you? It wasn't very busy. Leroy said I could have the rest of the night off. I got a big day tomorrow. Oh, that's right. You're going to Austin. Set it alight. I feel bad for poor old Eric Clapton having to follow you on stage. Would you like some coffee? Does it look like I want any coffee? You're not smiling. Oh, don't you know you're so cute when you smile? Okay, okay, all right. So I'll smile. Good. So, how was the rest of your night? You know, a bunch of drama. I went home. Dad's calling all the lawyers in town. He's gonna sue her. She is not gonna have a t-shirt to her name by the time he's through with her. She should've known better than to mess with the reapers. I don't think that's fair, I think you ought to leave her alone. So you are soft on her. Please, we've been through this whole thing, okay? Some of it. Anyways, anyways. I went over to Jessica's. How's she doing? She's mending slowly, but, uh... We had a... oh! Oh! So we had a few drinks. I'm so sorry. Is that a fact? Yes, yes... Here, do you want me to wash that in the morning? Or I could just get it off right now for you... No, no, hey, look, I think it's just... What do you think? It's time for you to go home. That's what I think. Come on. Oh, I'm not going home. No. Your father's had a bad enough... Day. I'm sorry. All right, you can sleep here and... All right. I'll sleep on the couch. Rest or sleep on the couch? No. Oh god. Hey, hey, hey. You are one naughty young girl. Yeah? Yeah. Mm, so now you're noticing. Now, look. I... What is this? Jolene's. I told you she was here. She wanted something from me, I didn't give it to her. She got mad. You expect me to believe that? Yes, it's the truth. It's obviously a set-up. Hey! I'm the one who's been set up. What? I know you hide that over there, I found... Good... good! You need help. Don't you tell me that I need help. Don't even say that. You're the reason I drink. Oh, come on. Oh, yes you are! I can't believe I trusted you. You know what you do? You indulge in emotional rape. Tell a girl you love her. Sure juices up the physical side, doesn't it? Come on, you know that's not true. Oh, that is not true? Is that what you're saying is not true? You know what? My dad was right about you. You are a no-good drifter. Don't you think that's a little bit unfair, Laura? No, I don't think it's unfair. I don't think it's unfair at all. You pull this load out of bull about how we should be so graced here in smithville. How you saved my little baby Rockwell. How you saved my dad, and how you saved me from a near-death experience because... You know what, if you never came, none of this would've happened, do you get that... Shut up. You are a jinx. I'm not looking for your gratitude. Well, good. Because as night follows day, you're not getting any. You and all your prissy ways. Thinking you're god's gift to creation, don't you? [Laura sobs] And this stupid diary. Hey, give me that. What is so special give me... About your... Get out of here! Your life! And your guitar. No, don't... don't... oh... Hey... you know what? Everybody that asks you to... [imitates guitar] Just give me... Don't touch... no... let's see how they like this sound. No, no. Laura, don't... let's see how they like this! You feel better? A whole lot better. What do you want me to be? You want me to be your drinking buddy? You want me to be your enabler, what? No, I don't want you to be my enabler. You want me to be your shoulder to cry on? What? I'm not gonna be crying anymore once you're out of my life. Just go. Whatever it is you want me to be, I would be delighted to be that. But what do you want me to be? I want you to listen up really hard. Because... I don't... Want you to... Be. Did you hear that? I don't want you to be. [She sobs] I don't want you to be. You get the message, buster? I don't want you to be. [Thunder booms] Sam? Sam? [Laura murmurs] Sam? [Chicken clucks] Oh, god. Sam? Sam? Where am I? [Thunder crashes] Rose? What happened here, Rose? What? Where's Sam? Sam who? Don't give me that, where's Sam? Look, little girl, don't start shouting at me. I don't know any Sam. Sam! He's your bartender, he works for you and Leroy. What, are you going crazy? The booze is getting to you too, just like your pa. Leroy is dead. Those two drifters shot him when they came in here and held up the place. You were here. Sam saved him. Oh, I have had it, night after night. I don't know why I agreed to let you stay in that storeroom. Look, get your old man and get out of here before I change my mind about that too. Dad? Dad? Daddy, come on. I didn't touch that hussy. I didn't touch that hussy. Touch who, daddy? Cost me my practice and treat me like a criminal, all because of that filthy accusation! That's enough! Think they'd have some compassion after Rockwell Jr. Was killed! Dad, shh. Rockwell Jr. He's alive. Daddy, it's Rockwell that's dead... Take him outta here before I call the police again. Rockwell's alive. Sam... Sam saved him. He got him out. He saved him, daddy, right before the truck came. Daddy, Rockwell... Laura, look at me. Daddy... Rockwell Jr. is dead just like Leroy is dead, and they ain't ever gonna come back again! No! What is this? What is going on? Sam? Where are you, Sam? [Cyrus mumbles] [Laura screams] [Thunder crashes] Justin, is Lisa there? No, listen, I'm looking for Sam! Sam who? Don't give me that! Sam doonby! Look, Laura, it's late. The three of US had a great time the other night. You gotta come over for dinner sometime. Maybe next weekend, huh? Hello? Antones. [Car honks] Yes, I need to speak to Sam doonby. No, he's opening for Eric Clapton. Sorry, lady. We got no one opening for Eric. Maybe you got the wrong place. Sam, where are you? Sam?! [Thunder crashes] Where are you? [Laura mutters] Hey there. Is Loretta around? She ain't here tonight, Lucy-Mae. Her mama's sick. She gotta stay behind. Hey, brother! How about a little service over here? Hey. Just tone it down, I'll be right with you. Okay, put it on the tab, Josh. Ain't much room on the page. Hi, Lucy-Mae. You want some lemonade? Nah, I don't. Loretta, I gotta talk. Keep your voice low, Lucy-Mae. Mama's down with a fever. Brad's over at the Jack o'diamonds motel. He asked me to go away with him. What about his wife? She don't know how to look after herself. Brad says she ain't got time for him no more. Girl, you crazy. How many times I heard that before? You told him? Course I ain't told him! How are you supposed to tell a guy who reckons you're his own personal property that you're three months pregnant. What you gonna do? I'm gonna go over to that new young doctor's clinic. He told me to come by when he was all closed up. What do you mean? I got some money saved. I'm out of here. I came to say goodbye. You mean you're just gonna... What do you expect me to do, huh? This is the last chance I'm gonna have to get out of this stupid little backwater. And I'm gonna take it. Me and Brad's going to Florida, and that is that. And what about the baby? Last night, you even had a name for him. Sam, weren't it? That was a joke. What sort of a life would he have to look forward to anyway? Are you okay, Lucy-Mae? Course I am, why wouldn't I be? Hey, Lucy-Mae, where are you going in such a hurry? None of your business, Nancy. Sorry, honey, I just thought I'd ask. I'm late for an appointment. I hope you're not about to do something crazy. I don't need your advice. You don't have to do this. There're plenty of good folks here that... That can help you, folks that care for you. Oh yeah? Well, where these good folks been these past three or four years, huh? They just pass you by and whisper behind them Lacey curtains. What happened to the father? He just run off? Maybe. Just like Mr. Thurber, huh? That was his decision. He's got that same devil's curse you have. What curse would that be? Huh? The urge to laugh and dance? To feel alive? To see something outside of Parker county? You should've thought of that before. Before what? Before I made one tiny mistake? Tiny mistake? Is that how you look at that kid of yours? Children are a miracle, a gift from god. It's your duty to look after 'em good. You got responsibilities, girl. Well, maybe I have. But I'll make my own decisions, Nancy. Sure don't need any help from you. You sure this is gonna be okay, doc? Ah, yeah, just a quick simple procedure. Nothing to it. You done a lot of these, huh? Ah, sure. There are a lot of girls like you. Made a mistake. Got caught. Ah, don't worry. If you don't want it to be, then I'm the guy that fixes it. Oh, Sam. I'm sorry. I'm so, so sorry. [Thunder rumbles] I would've liked to know how you grew up. What you did with your life. I know I'd have been proud of you. I'd like to have been there to meet the girl you fell in love with. I bet she'd have been pretty. No. I bet she'd have been better than me. No. No. No. No. But I'm nobody, really.
