[Reporter] The body of another young woman has washed ashore here in Venice Beach Police now suspect that a serial killer may be... Turn that up, please. -Could you turn that up? -Yeah. 21-year-old Halle Philton, a college student, disappeared after telling a roommate she was going to go connect with a man she had been talking with online. Philton's body was found here in shallow water actually about 100 yards from where coffee heiress Alexia Montrose was found recently, and it turns out that there are other similarities between these two young women. Both have red hair, both of them died under similar circumstances -although the detectives won't tell us -Oh, my God. what those circumstances are. Doesn't look like our fisherman is the catch and release type. More the catch and gut type. I have to see him this afternoon. Well, if you don't show up, he'll know something's up. So, go to lunch and get the evidence and then we will go straight to the police.

I'm sorry to hear that. Oh, be sorry for them. People pay the price when they toy with me. Do you trust me? Yeah, of course. Because I-- I'm starting to get the feeling you don't. Why would you say that? You've been acting differently lately. Are you sure you're not getting cold feet? No, I'm planning to make the transfer on Friday from Jason's account to yours just like we were talking about. Good. Honey, everything is gonna be okay. After Friday, we won't have a care in the world. What is the catch of the day? [Caroline recording] Everything okay? [Gavin] Uh, not really. No, A client backed out on me unexpectedly today. -I'm sorry to hear that. -Oh, be sorry for them. People pay the price when they toy with me. Well, now that's something. [Detective Mickle] So what kind of business do you do, Mr. Donato? I am an independent financial consultant. Right. That's nice and vague, isn't it? For someone who has little idea how the financial world works, I suppose it would be, Detective. [chuckles] So, if I wanted to see records of all your most recent business transactions... You'd need a warrant. And while we're on the subject of me telling you how to do your job, I am not saying another word until my lawyer gets here. All right, Mr. Donato. We don't have to talk about your business. But until your lawyer gets here, why don't you just humor me with some small talk? You're from Italy, Mr. Donato. Yes. -Where in Italy? -Nerano. It is a small village. Si. [speaking Italian] [speaking Italian] [speaking Italian] Oh, maybe you just prefer to speak English. Got a girlfriend, Gavin? I mean, a good looking boy like you... bet you meet a lot of nice girls online. [gasps] Luckily, we have a warrant for the bank records of Halle Philton. Care to explain this? I know you're not trying to talk to my client without me being present, Detective. Oh, your client? Oh, we were just having a little chat about his love life. Hear he makes quite the killing. I don't know what you're insinuating, Detective, but unless you're charging Mr. Donato with something, we're leaving. Gratzi. [Detective Mickle chuckles] Wow, your boyfriend's a real charmer. That was it? He's still expecting a transfer from you tomorrow, right? Yeah. Good. I'll put together a sting operation. But that's all for financial fraud charges, right? I mean, this guy is a killer, Detective. Listen, caught is caught. Once we've got him under our thumb, if there's more evidence to be found, we'll find it. For now we have to work with what we've got. -And this stuff, yeah, it's easier than I-- -Totally. -than it looks, right? -Yeah. Hello, my love. Hey. I thought it was about time I met Issie and I-- I wanted to surprise you. Gavin was just giving me advice on how to handle Noah. Ah, yes. But remember, if he doesn't step up and treat you like you are the only one for him, he is dead to you. Issie, I need to speak to Gavin. If you could go to your room, please. -But he was gonna take us-- -Now, Issie. You know, I gotta hand it to you, Caroline. I didn't think you'd be this much trouble. You're not even Italian. Yeah, that-- that first date... [sighs] it was, um, the test to see how much effort I'm gonna need to put in. And you... with those starry eyes and... your broken heart, you... you were like Silly Putty from the moment we met. Screw you, Gavin. Okay. You see, I... I find that if you push a woman's boundaries sexually, she's more inclined to take chances outside of the bedroom... like steal from work for a guy she knows nothin' about. You didn't break me, Gavin. Get out of my house. "I... I loved against reason... "against promise, against peace... against hope, against happiness." [screams] I broke you! -[gasping] -I broke you. It is time to give up your money because if you go to the police, if you go up against me... -Mom! -[gasps] -Oh... -Hey, Mom! -I'm gonna go over to Noah's. -Yeah, okay. Are you okay? Yeah, no, I can-- I can drive you to Noah's. Did you-- you guys got back together? Yeah. Gavin's advice actually worked. I see why you like him so much. He's, like, a love expert. [sobs] -[voicemail beep] -Um... Detective Mickle, if you get this message, I, um... I just, I can't... I just-- I'm out. I can't-- I can't do this. Goddamn! [gasps] You all right? Yeah, I'm okay. Thanks. [voicemail beep] [Margot] It's Margot. You know what to do. Oh, my God. [gasps] [Sean] Hey, Caroline, I need to show you the-- [siren wailing] [Officer Hess] The place is a rental.

[car door closes] ♪ ♪ [Reporter] Most of his marks knew him as Gavin Donato, a successful Italian businessman. His real name, Michael Petrouka, a con artist from Boston, but now most widely known as the Missed Connections Killer. Once caught by authorities, evidence of dozens of fraudulent financial transactions were unearthed, totaling more than $2 million in stolen money, and all of them starting with a romantic seduction from the popular Missed Connections website. But in the end, Alexia Montrose, Halle Philton, and and Margot Fouratt were his final marks, and who paid with their lives. But it's thanks to the courage of another mark, Caroline Prati, that police finally honed in on Petrouka and captured him. Oh, my God. Mom, look at this. Issie, what are you doing looking at this website? It's cathartic. But look. They've posted every day for the past two weeks. [Margot] Caroline! Margot. I don't understand. What don't you understand? Oh, Caroline. You never understand anything that's staring you in the face and neither did Gavin. [chuckles] We didn't keep him around for that though, did we? Come in. Have a drink. We're celebrating. I'm alive! I know that you liked my boyfriend, but it doesn't matter because I invented him. [Caroline] What's going on? You look great. I know it was mean, but Gavin and I used to laugh at you for falling for that Missed Connections ad. [chuckles] "Your body was quiet and your soul reached out to me." I wrote that. [chuckles] And his mom's tomato sauce, I made that. And this house, I own it. When I first met him, his name was Mikey and he was from Boston. He worked in some dive bar and he lived on his dad's fishing boat. He didn't know the difference between a Merlot and a Bordeaux. [chuckles] His Italian accent, I mean, it was the worst! He could never get it right! I told him it would be what took him down. But Detective Mickle, she was smart. She could see right through him, but you... How did you fall for that? You're smarter than that. Why did you bring me here? I used to watch you and Issie. You're a really good mom. You stay away from my daughter. And I watched you and Gavin. And I told you not to sleep with him. And you promised me you wouldn't, but you lied to my face. And I hate liars! Like that Alexia. Stupid little rich bitch. She tried to steal him from me. "One more con, baby. It's just you and me." You were gonna be the last one. $5 million, and then... and then... he went after Halle and her college tuition? I mean, this isn't amateur hour. You were a little more sexually adventurous than I imagined. I'm getting out of here. -Sit down -[gasps] and relax. Drink your champagne. Just drink it. [chuckles] We're friends. We're friends, aren't we? I feel that we are connected. Not like the others. Gavin didn't kill them. [chuckles] No. Gavin's not a killer. But he's worse. He destroyed my life. He broke my heart. He made me wish I was dead! [sighs] You don't have to do this. I am sitting alone, watching news and sweet, little Caroline, she's the hero... and I'm rotting away in some Tijuana motel. All alone. And Gavin, he's locked up now. She's a crazy bitch! Now Gavin is safe from all of you. You're insane. A sacrifice had to be made. [gasps] It is time to give up, Caroline.
