Sakura, your face is reflected in this glass right now. You're gorgeous, just like me. When I look in a mirror, I fall in love with myself. You're lying again! What do you mean by that? No smoking! Oh, come on! Just one! No! Oh, OK. Are we at the cherry trees? Yeah. Are they out? No, not yet. The blossoms might be late this year. They might? Satoshi... ...tell me again. About why your name means 'cherry blossom'? I want to hear it again. Oh, well... What do cherry blossoms look like? They're... ...a pretty little flower, light pink. In spring, on the big cherry trees, they all bloom at once. Millions of them. People gather underneath them to drink and carry on. Come on, Sakura! People forget their troubles at the sight of the cherry blossoms. They watch over our meetings and our partings. Flowers everyone loves. Flowers that make everyone happy. The sakura blossoms. I like that part about making everyone happy. This is no good! Are we short of phone staff? Possibly. 'Possibly'? That's your job! You're supposed to know! Kazuko, they're all trying their hardest. Be a little nicer. There's only two days left. We've got to push! You know that! I'm hoping the TV speeches tonight will put us in front. Do your best right to the end. That is all. Please, everyone... Let's work hard. I'm going home to change before I go to the TV station. Get the car. Death Notification Takizawa, Naoki A shutaway... Takizawa Death Notification Notice of Delivery Interference with a subject is a violation of regulations. Hey! Shit! Hey! Hey! What are you doing?! Let go! Why did you butt in?! Why did you butt in?! Excuse this intrusion! Naoki Takizawa? Who are you?! I have something for you. Your Death Notification. You are granted free transportation, food, and lodging. Your family will receive a pension from the National Prosperity Fund. However, should you commit a crime... That's great! It's hilarious! Are you here... ...to save me... ...or kill me? Who cares? Now it'll end. Naoki! Keep out! What in the world...?! Why? Why you? Mom... I have a favor to ask of you. Make a speech for me tomorrow. This election is going to be close. But if the voters know you're dying for National Prosperity... What are you saying?! You shut up! You stay shut away in this room, so you may as well be dead! This is a golden opportunity! Please! Help me! I'm going to die alone. Get out of here. Get out! Out! Get out of here now! Out! Get out! And you, too! Out! Why did you save me? Naoki... Naoki! Naoki! How could you! I have to win! Kazuko! Excuse me. No! No! No! Good night. All went well? Yes, sir. No problems? Not particularly. Good. Naoki Takizawa's mother is a prominent politician. A conservative. A former thought criminal. She is? She recanted in prison. I don't know what happened there. Why tell me that? You're on duty tonight? Yes. This is for tomorrow morning. Go directly there. It's two in a row, but if you wouldn't mind... All right. Good night, then. Iizuka, Satoshi You still owe us for the pay sites you've accessed. Look, if you don't pay your late charges... ...we have a problem. Hello? I understand, but... Pay up or you're dead meat! Pay by tomorrow or we send the collection squad. Understand?! Satoshi! They can hear you outside. Don't get carried away. Sorry. Well done. I gave you a bonus. Thank you. Now I can finally stop crashing here. I don't care if you stay. Keep up the good work. Certainly the loss of a son is a grievous burden to bear. But I am one whose life is dedicated to the state. I am prepared to overcome this grief. My son himself said these words to me: I am happy to die in the cause of National Prosperity... ...so go for it, Mom.' In pride at the honor of my son's death... ...I reaffirm this pledge to our nation's people: I will battle to the death... ...for this beautiful land. Could you open the door? I know I'm not much of a man. Secretary to a Diet Member' sounds nice... ...but it just means I'm living off my wife. Even still... ...I'm your father, after all. At least let me spend your last day with you. Naoki... Those tears Kazuko was crying... ...they were real. She still... ...has a mother's heart. Naoki... ...open the door. If you won't... ...then I will! These marks... ...make me look bad! I'll try harder, Mom. For you! It's not for me! I want you to be someone who serves the state! How can the son of a Diet member have grades like these? Aren't you ashamed?! I've had enough. I have no hopes for you. I'm going to act as if you never existed. Hello? It's Ishii. Yes, sir? Naoki Takizawa is at large with a gun stolen from a policeman. He may be harboring resentment against you. Exercise caution. What should I do? You needn't do anything. Leave this to the police. Detective... Yes? Until tomorrow's election is over... ...don't tell my wife. Please. It could hurt her chances. I'll win. I'm going to win. I will win this! Akizawa, Naoki Time to death: 11 hours, 25 minutes ...seven, eight, nine, ten. It's all here. Here's the key, then. I'll draw up a receipt. It was hard to find a place to suit you. What's the date today? There aren't many places that nice. I'll just put my chop on this... Mr Iizuka? Satoshi Iizuka? National Prosperity Center... I have a called while you were out' form. Your name, please? Iizuka, Satoshi. Iizuka, Satoshi... Yes, a Death Notification has been sent. We'll redeliver it. Where can you be reached? Hello? Mr Iizuka? Hello? Give it back. Give it back! Give it back! Hey! Let go! Sakura... Here. Did you get in a fight? No. I just got it back. Really? Really. Don't worry, Sakura. I'll look after you. I'll always look after you. OK. Sorry. I did get into a fight. Sakura, help! I understand. The Transplants Law says patients must be taken in turn. In principle, you can't designate a recipient... Then find a way! I'm all she's got! I said 'in principle'. The National Prosperity Law grants you that right. Then my corneas... I see... Have Sakura admitted as soon as you can. I will. Thank you. Doctor, I don't want my sister to know about this. She won't have the operation if she does. He's at Meisei General Hospital? All right. Hey, you! I'll be there in an hour. Everything checks out fine. A donor at last. Isn't that nice! Yes. The operation is tomorrow at 11. So nothing but water after 9 tonight. Right. She doesn't mean you. Oh yeah... Oh, you! Excuse me. I still can't believe it. It's all so sudden! Great, huh? My heart's pounding. I hope it goes all right. You worry too much. Will you stay with me after the operation? Sure I will! The first face I want to see is yours. The face you fall in love with. Look forward to it. I'm starving. I'll go get something to eat. Iizuka, Sakura Satoshi Iizuka? The Prosperity Center contacted me. I have your Death Notification. The time is 10 a.m. Tomorrow... Not here! What's going on, Satoshi? You're here, aren't you? An ikigami? No, it's someone else. But he said 'Satoshi Iizuka'! It's written differently, and the picture's someone else. Isn't it. Uh, yes. A civil servant ought to be more careful. Satoshi, you're lying again. I can tell! I'm not lying! Are you donating your corneas to me? I don't want them! There's no point in seeing if you're dead! Tell her, will you! I'm sorry. I was mistaken. See? You're over-reacting. You said the Notification was for 10 a.m., didn't you. Yes. Satoshi, if you're alive at 10, I'll have the operation. If you're not here, I won't. Because that's the hour I'll die, too. You and your big mouth! Why'd you have to come here?! I'm supposed to die at 10! How can I lie to her after that?! Mr Iizuka! I'm very sorry. It was going so well! Then the delivery boy goes and wrecks it! Naoki! Naoki Takizawa! Life is the most precious thing in the world. This we must keep in our hearts as we live from day to day. Thus the National Prosperity Law... ...imposes an ordeal on our young. Friends, lovers, family, ourselves... no one knows when death will come. It is this very sense... ...that makes life so dear. And it is this sense that makes our country strong. That's right! Thank you. Well? Too many people around. Be ready to grab him if you see him. Detective... If my son turns up, could we have a few minutes... ...for the family to talk before you take him away? He has a gun. He might shoot your wife. He won't shoot his mother. Are you sure? Excuse me! Could I get through? Excuse me... Roger. Some of you may be aware... ...that my son will leave this life under the National Prosperity Law. But he has uttered not one word of complaint. He is happy and proud to serve the foundations of this nation! I swear to you I will not waste... ...my son's death! Excuse me! Naoki! Naoki, wait! Naoki! Naoki! You're here for me! Ladies and gentlemen, my son has come to support me! Naoki! Get him! Out of the way! Excuse me! Come up here. Naoki, come on... Naoki! Mama! Mama, it hurts! I'll protect you! They won't inject you! Naoki! I'll protect you, I swear! Naoki! - Naoki! - Mom! Mom! Naoki! Naoki... Mom... Naoki! Naoki! Naoki! For a while there... ...I was lost. Naoki! Naoki! Naoki Takizawa died an hour before his appointed time. At 3:58 p.m., he was shot to death. He was 20. He had one more hour. One more hour... What? There's still a way. A way your sister can have the operation. How? We have all the clocks in this hospital set forward... ...one hour. If the clocks are set one hour ahead... ...they'll say 10 when it will still be 9. Mr Iizuka can be there with his sister. She can't see. We can fool her if everyone cooperates in what she hears. Easier said than done. We can tell the staff, but what about the patients? We'll go see all of them. If that's the case, can we do this, sir? I would very much like to. Isn't that against the rules? I'll be responsible. Should you still be here? Yes. It's all right. I appreciate your doing all this. It's all right. I want to help. I'm sorry I blew up. Not at all. There. One hour ahead If Ms Iizuka asks you the time, please add one hour. Please. Please help make a brother's last wish come true. Please! I'd like to ask for your help. Please. Think it'll work? Whatever happens, just keep lying. Could I ask a favor? Iizuka, Satoshi Time to death: 3 hours, 53minutes You still look half-asleep! There you go. All done. What time is it? 07:30 Already? We'll start prepping you in three hours. OK. Um... ...could we have the TV on? What, at this hour? Excuse her. The electricians are in today. We can't use the TV till noon. It's on that poster. Um... Yes? What time is it now? 7:30. You just asked! You keep quiet! What time is it? It's just gone 7:33. The store opens at 7, doesn't it? The store?! I thought it was 8... I'll go check. I'll go. What do you want? No. Sakura! Sakura! You still don't believe me? You're so suspicious! What do you need? A battery. A battery? Let me see that thing... Whoops! Looks like I broke it. I'll get you a new one. Satoshi, are you fooling me about the time? What a thing to say! How would I do that? There are some things that even I can't do. Where are you going? The store. Sakura! That's not the way to the store, you know. That's the way to the cafeteria, Sakura. No, maybe you're right. Sakura! Don't ignore me! Sakura! 'Satoshi's calling! ' Ms Iizuka? It's time to go. OK. See you later. Away you go. Satoshi... Yeah? I'm sorry I doubted you. I know that. See you, then. Sakura... Yes? What? I lied to you. I... I'm not good-Iooking at all. Sorry. Is that all? You're an idiot. Go for it. She's gone. I lied to her till the very end. Well... we'd better get ready, too. Thank you for everything. Satoshi Iizuka... With your death, you serve our nation. May you rest in peace. I don't want to die! Why do I have to be killed? I don't want to die yet! Satoshi Iizuka died at his appointed time. Immediately following, his corneas were removed... ...and transplanted safely into his younger sister. Fujimoto... ...you do understand? All right, Fujimoto. The investigation is complete. You ignored my warning and violated regulations. You lose a year's salary and bonus. You will undergo retraining. That, I am told, is your punishment. You're lucky! I kept silent, as you ordered. But to tell the truth, this law... Fujimoto! Keep your thoughts on this matter to yourself. Till the time comes. Till the time comes? Excuse me... We've been looking for you! I'm sorry about Tsubasa. A fine talent wasted. And, as Tsubasa wanted, we'd like to promote you. With 'Signpost', of course. No, thanks. But... I have no songs for you. I know how you feel, but... Go away. Come on. Every day young people die, and another story is born. Eventually people forgot 'Signpost'... ...but the passion Tsubasa sang it with... ...lives on in songs sung on the streets. Departmental press regulations kept Naoki Takizawa's story... ...out of the media. Kazuko Takizawa, however, was defeated. Why tear up the divorce form? There's no point in our being married. Yes, there is. I'm going to run for City Council. I want you to help. Then I'll run for the Prefecture, and then the National Diet. It may take years, but one day... ...I'll get rid of that law. And Sakura Iizuka... Sakura, I wasn't lying. You're the prettiest girl in the world. Satoshi... ...thank you. Congratulations! Have your inoculations. Don't be afraid. Have your inoculation. Let's have our inoculations. Don't be afraid. Congratulations! In this land there is freedom, peace, and wealth. But suddenly one day, without mercy... ...the nation discards a handful of its citizens.
