Now let's change that slogan for something different. How about this? Uh, " Mardi Gracias to you. " - Mr. McCracken- - Repeat that, Enrique. The office is full of people screaming at me. - Mr. McCracken, the Queen is on the rocks. - Yeah! What? What rocks? Where? - On a reef off the tip of Florida somewhere. I just got word. - Is it bad? Well, it's inconvenient, but I don't think there's any danger. They're only 200 yards offshore. Well, what was the captain doing in there with a whole ocean to play around in? Well, go ahead with that copy, but take out the line about skirting the Florida coast. Adios, Enrique. I'll be in Williams's office. - Hello, Dad. Doesn'tJay look wonderful? - Wonderful. I've just got word that the Cuban Queen is piled up on a reef down in Florida. - How'd that happen? A storm? - No! I just checked on it. It was the clearest night in years. There weren't any casualties, but there could be plenty of lawsuits... and you've got to get down there and take care of things. Oh, no, he doesn't. Jay doesn't leave this town. Have you forgotten we're being married Saturday? - I had, but it doesn't make any difference. - Oh, doesn't it? No! That ship's worth five million. Your wedding's only costing 3,000. You'd better call up and charter a plane. Excuse me. Miss Sullivan, call Eastern Airways and ask them- Jay, turn that thing off. This is ridiculous. What makes you think you have to go with this building full of people? - Send somebody else. - Send somebody else? Don't you realize what it could cost us in damage suits... if this isn't handled diplomatically? You remember the Calypso Queen? Just a little accident- nobody hurt. We neglected to get waivers from four or five passengers, and what happened? We got sued for $500,000. Whenever there's any kind of an accident... I always say, remember the Calypso. Dad, if you mess up my wedding, I'll never forgive you. Look, you can get married anytime... but there's only one time to get 480 passengers off a reef... - and that's as soon as possible. - [ Intercom Buzzing ] [ Miss Sullivan On Intercom ] Eastern Airways. - Tell them you don't want them. - We do want them! I want a plane ready to leave for Florida in 40 minutes. - He's not going, I tell you. - Oh, yes, he is going, and I'm- I'm sorry. Well, what are you doing on the floor anyway? Dad, now I mean this. You haven't the faintest idea how important this is to me. Now keep your shirt on, Terry. He'll be down there this afternoon and back tomorrow night at the latest. You know, something strikes me. I never realized Jay was so indispensable around here. If he's this important, he ought to have more money. You young pirate. He's getting more than the other two vice presidents right now. Well, he's worth more, or you'd be sending the other two. All right. All right. He'll get more. If I'd known I was gonna have a gun stuck in my face... I wouldn't have gone so heavy on that wedding present. Now that I've ransomed you,Jay, do you mind getting ready and getting out of here? - [Jay ] Right away. - [ Grumbling ] Now when you switch reservations, you have to go through a little red tape. Will you sign this, please? It's just a form that says the company wasn't to blame for the accident. You'll like the Caribbean Queen. She's a newer boat. - Oh, thank you very much. - Thank you. - That'll be all. Thanks again. - Thank you. - Well, I guess that's about it. - There's one more- Miss Nan Spencer in E-76. - We notified her. - Apparently she's bashful. E-76. Is that above or below the keel? - Ah, hello. - Miss Spencer? - Yes? - My name is Williams, and- Oh, I'm glad to know you, Mr. Williams. Are you Mr. Garvey's friend? - Garvey? - Yes. I was dancing with Mr. Garvey last night... and he mentioned a friend he'd like me to meet. - Well, no, I'm afraid I'm not the one. - Oh, it doesn't matter anyway. I like the way nobody stands on ceremony on shipboard. I met dozens of people last night. Uh, would you like to come in? - No, thanks. I only have a minute. - Oh. Miss Spencer, I represent the steamship company... and before we refund your passage money, we'd like your signature on this waiver. Oh, you would? Well, what about my vacation? What happens to me? Well, after all, Miss Spencer, it couldn't be helped. - It- It was no one's fault. - It was too somebody's fault. - It was? Whose? - The captain's. If he'd been up on the bridge where he belonged instead of where he was... there never would have been any accident. Uh, if you don't mind, I- I think I will come in. Hmm. This is what your brochure calls spacious quarters. Sit down if you can find a place. Miss Spencer, about the captain, I don't think I quite understood what you meant. Well, last night I was up on deck with a gentleman... and when we hit the reef, there was a lot of excitement... and people started running out of their cabins. The captain didn't come out of his. If he'd been tending to his job instead of- Well, we wouldn't be perched up on this sandbar right now. - Now really, Miss Spencer, I- - And just because of that, my vacation is ruined. And I don't intend to let him get away with it either! Your vacation isn't going to be ruined, Miss Spencer. If you'll let us have your signature on this waiver... we'll exchange your tickets at no extra cost for passage on the Caribbean Queen... which leaves in two weeks. Two weeks? But I only have two weeks' vacation. In two weeks, I'll be back in Macy's selling hosiery. Oh, that's too bad. That does eliminate your going on the Caribbean Queen. Well, I'm afraid all we can do is try to make it up to you with a small check. A check won't make it up. I've saved for years. I've gone without lunches just so I could have this cruise. I've planned on it. I- I've worn old dresses so I could have lovely clothes for it. Do you think you can pay me back for all the fun I'm not gonna have with a check? Aren't you being a little difficult? Well, why not? I'm being cheated out of my trip. I- I tell you what we'll do, Miss Spencer. We want you to have your trip just as much as you want it. Suppose we send you on to Havana by plane... pay all your expenses and give you a good time. Wouldn't that be fair? - When would I leave? - Right away. Well, I- I suppose that is pretty fair. Well, I'm- I'm glad that's settled. Now may I have your signature on this form, please? You seem pretty anxious to get it. Well, I haven't much time. I'm due back in New York. Well, I'm not signing anything until after I've had that trip. But I've told you what we'll do for you. Well, how do I know I'll have a good time? Well, that we can't guarantee. All we can do is expose you to having a good time. Well, I only hope I have as much fun as your brochure said I'd have. Well, I'll- I'll make the arrangements, Miss Spencer. Uh, I'll contact you later. That's all I hope. But you don't understand, Mr. McCracken. She won't sign until after she's had the vacation... and she won't sign it then if she hasn't had a good time. She can't get that high-handed with us! Oh, yes, she can. There's something she knows about the ship's going aground... that I can't repeat over the air. There is? You mean she could sue us? - Remember the Calypso. - All right. All right. Give her anything she wants within reason. Or it might even be a little unreasonable, just so she signs that waiver. But don't you leave her side until you get that signature. But that'll take two weeks! Have you forgotten about my wedding? You can get married anytime. Now keep in close touch with me. Bye. Good-bye. [ Chorus ] How would you Like to spend a weekend in Havana Havana [ Singing In Spanish ] Ay-ah [ Vocalizing ] You'd better pack up all your summer clothes I'll see you down at SloppyJoe's So long, boy and ship ahoy, Havana Havana Havana Why, it's so gorgeous. Well, there is no better suite in the hotel, and there is no better hotel in the city. Se?orita. There is no better view in the whole country. - Oh, I knew it would be romantic. - Romantic? Se?orita, there is no place on this earth it is so romantic. It's a wonder the population isn't bigger. Oh, they come and go, but the reaction is always the same. Here we have more alignments of the heart than any other place in the world. And there have been more marriages in this hotel... than any other hotel in the world. - Really? - But absolutely. And this is only what you call a fractional part of the romances. - Well, uh, what are the best nightclubs here? - Best nightclubs? Oh, the Sans Souci, the Club Coraz?n, the Midi- Midi's of course very popular with tourists. But personally I prefer best the Casino Madrile?o. Oh. Of course I've never been there. My information is only what I adhere to accidentally... but I have noticed that the people in the hotel who go there... - come back latest and sleep longest- - Ah. and tip hardest. Oh- Oh, I'm so sorry. I forgot all about it. - There you are. - Thank you. Se?orita, you will not notice the slightest difference in the service. Oh, thank you. - Oh, hello there. - Hello. - Won't you come in? - Thanks. - Is everything all right? - Oh, it's gorgeous. Couldn't be better. - Just look at the view. - Oh, nice, isn't it? I have the same view from my window. And the bedroom! - How do you like it? - Very nice. Even our furniture display on the ninth floor was never like this. It's the, uh, presidential suite, you know. Well, the whole cabinet could use the bathtub. [ Sighs ] They ought to have lifeguards. During the off-season, they undoubtedly use it as a dry dock. - Simply gorgeous. - I'm glad you're pleased, Miss Spencer. Oh, I am. It just couldn't be nicer. Then perhaps you wouldn't mind signing this waiver now. You never forget business for a minute, do you? Why, yes, I do. Sometimes. Bet not for more than a minute. Well, I am rather anxious to get this signed. I'd like to get back to New York. If you remember, I told you I wouldn't sign anything... - until after I've had that vacation. - Why not? How do I know I wouldn't be thrown out of here the minute you left? Why, that's ridiculous. That's not the way our company does business. Maybe not, but you can't be too careful of these big corporations. - I don't think they'll get away with anything with you. - [ Chuckles ] Well, what would you like to do first? See the sights? All right. But you'll have to wait till I swim across that bathtub and back. I'll be in the bar when you're ready. [ Barking ] " Sugar is the greatest industry of the Cuban Republic... " and a visit to its vast sugarcane fields will afford moments of rare interest. "Hundreds of thousands of Cubans are concerned directly or indirectly... "with the production or marketing of this commodity. "The cutting season extends from December toJune, and the cane is cut with machetes. "Oxen are still used to till the fields and haul the cane to railroad cars. " During 1940, 1,174,369 tons... " were exported to the United States alone. - At Havana's door, there are"- - Now wait a minute. When you asked me to go sightseeing, you really meant it, didn't you? I thought it was a pretty drive, but what would you rather see? Well, I understand there are countless bars and numberless nightclubs in Havana. Oh, I'd planned on taking you to one tonight. There's a place called Midi's that's supposed to be very nice. Midi's? All the tourists go there. I'll bet if I was seeing Havana with Arnold Spreckles... he wouldn't take me to any second-rate nightclub. Where do you think Arnold Spreckles would take you? Mmm, the Casino " Madelino. " All right. We'll go there. Anything that Spreckles can do... the McCracken Steamship Company ought to be able to do. Think so?

You're at the best nightclub in town. You have orchids and champagne. What else do you want? You wouldn't know. [ Continues ] Would it make you any happier if I made love to you? Isn't that a little out of your line? Hmm. Anything to please you. [ Sighs ] My, you certainly sweep a girl off her feet. Look, I want you to enjoy this vacation. What do you suggest? Well, for a starter, let's part company. But you can't just go around alone. Why not? I can have as dull a time alone as I can with you. And besides, who said I had to be alone? - Well, good night, Mr. Williams. - Well, where are you going? That's what I like about it. I don't know.

Oh, well, one of two things happened, se?orita. You were insulted, or you were not insulted. And beyond that, you are not going home alone. I am Monte Blanca. - Uh, shall we go now? - Oh, but I don't even know you. [ Laughs ] Charming, isn't it? Atouch of mystery adds a great deal of zest. All right, Monte. Let's go. [ Continues ] [ Ends ] - Se?orita. - Thank you. - Se?orita. - Hello. Much to my amazement, I have brought you home. - Yes, you could knock me over with a feather too. - Really? - Thanks a lot, Mr. Blanca. - And what time tomorrow night shall I call? Oh, you're-you're calling tomorrow night? Oh, this is what is known as a preliminary flirtation. - And, uh, what's tomorrow night? - Saturday. Then I can definitely make it. It's my maid's night out. Good. We will go to the casino again... but upstairs to the tables, if you like. - Oh, it sounds exciting. - Being with you will be exciting even if we lose. [ Laughs ] Well- - Buenas noches, se?orita. - Uh- "Bonas"noches. Oh, excuse me. You, uh, are sure she is wealthy? It is the surest thing in the whole world. She has the most expensive suite in the hotel. Her clothes-They are the most luxurious and thinnest I have ever seen. And if this is not proof enough, she tipped me only 10 cents. - She must be very wealthy. - [ Chuckles ] You will get your whole payment in a lump... and if your information is not accurate, it will be a lump on the head. - Se?or. - Good evening. - Se?or Williams, for you. - Thank you. Hmm. - Where can I send a cable? - I'm sorry, se?or. The office is closed. - Can I take your answer? - Yes. To Walter McCracken- M- C-C-R-A-C-K-E-N. McCracken Building, New York City. No progress. Girl looking for romance... but you can't rush nature. Regards,Jay. - You got that? - Yes, se?or. And how would you like this sent? Oh, I think something with a black edge around it might be appropriate. [ Latin ] [ Chattering ] The one in the middle is the lucky table. The croupier is color-blind. Oh, wonderful! No more bets, please. Evening, Flores. [ Flores ] Fourteen, red. Fourteen, the winner. - Astack of the blues, please. - Blues? - For the young lady. They will match her eyes. - [ Chuckles ] - One stack of blacks. - How much are they? Who cares? To you, they are nothing but chips. [ Man ] Thirty-three, the winner. Uh, while you are playing, I would like to make a call. - Oh, but don't be too long. - Oh, I'll be back before you break the bank. [ Flores ] Place your bets, please. [ Continues, Fades ] [ Chuckles ] Hello, Boris. How are you? Glad to see you here, Monte. Saves me the trouble of sending for you. Oh, I would have come up yesterday, only I had not, uh, yet made my arrangements. Funeral? No, financial. [ Chuckles ] But I am going to pay tonight- perhaps the whole thing. It's, uh, exactly $750. Well, I cannot give it to you this minute, Boris, but you are going to get it. You are going to get more than that. I, uh, brought a very rich girl here tonight. She owns half of America. She loses thousands every night. That becomes interesting. All right. I'll have the croupier suspend the table limit while you're playing. If the young lady lives up to your expectations... I'll credit your account with five percent of all she loses. Well, she will have to lose a great deal. Don't you think 10% is a little more equitable? I don't want to haggle with you, Monte. You'll either get five percent of the young lady's losses... or a hundred percent of what I planned for you before you came in. [ Laughing ] Well, five percent is perfectly satisfactory. - I was just trying to get the best deal I could. - You have. [ Chuckles ] - Well, I'll see you later, eh, Boris? - Do. [ Resumes ] [ Exhales ] - [ Roulette Ball Rattles ] - [ Flores ] Fourteen, red. Fourteen, the winner. That's me. That's me again! Oh, thank you. Thank you. Oh, Monte! You were right about this table being lucky. Look, I won it all on 14. Fourteen again! No, no, no, no. You must not bet on that again. It could never repeat. Oh, that's what everybody's been telling me. No, a good roulette player is one who knows how to change. - Now this time you should bet heavily on eight. - Eight? Why? Well, uh, eight and six make 14. The next time, you bet on six. It's an infallible system. Well, you were right about this being a lucky table... - so, uh, I'll change to eight. - Number eight. - Thank you. - Uh, a little more. - Yes, sir. - [ Chuckles ] [ Flores ] No more bets, please. [ Roulette Ball Rattling ] [ Flores ] Eight, black. Eight, the winner. Oh, that's me. That's me again! - Oh, Monte, you're wonderful! - Uh, yes, I am. You don't seem very excited, but I guess you do this every night. This or cut my throat. - Se?or? - Hmm? Oh, uh, stand. Now we bet on six, don't we? You know what I think I'll do? I think I'll put everything on six. [ Gasps ] No, no, no, no! That-That would be wrong. Oh, why? How could I lose with you helping me? - I'm gonna do it. Everything on six. - But- - The whole thing, se?orita? - The whole thing on six. [ Flores ] No more bets, please. [ Ball Rattling ] - [ Flores ] Fourteen, red. Fourteen, the winner. - [ Gasps ] Oh, Monte, I lost. I knew I should've stuck to 14. Oh, do not let a little thing like that worry you. We will win it all back again. We will just keep alternating from eight to six, from six to eight. Acouple of stacks of the blues. [ Flores ] Seven, red. Seven, the winner. - [ Nan ] Ah, we've lost again. - [ Flores ] Place your bets, please. [ Roulette Ball Rattling ] [ Flores ] Fourteen, red. [ Nan ] Oh, we've lost again. Monte, let's go. [ Monte ] No, no, no. When your luck is this bad, it is bound to change. Give us four stacks, Flores. Now we must start doubling up. [ Flores ] Thirty-three, black. Thirty-three, the winner. - Uh, Flores, give us another stack of- - No. No matter what you say, that's enough for anyone to lose in one evening. Oh, well, it does not matter. Maybe tomorrow you will be luckier, eh? - Flores, what are the young lady's losses? - $3,000. Oh,just $3,000. Seems like an awful lot to me, but if you enjoy it, it's up to you. - What? - Well, you didn't even have the fun of playing. Take me a long time to earn that much. What? Uh, you mean, if you had to work. Oh, you can find me any day at Macy's from 9:30 to 5:30. Macy's. - What is Macy's? - It's a big department store in New York. Oh. [ Laughs ] You own it. No, no. I work there- in hosiery. But- But surely you are not serious. Your-Your hotel accommodations are not those of a shopgirl. I'll say they're not. I'm traveling at the expense of the steamship company. - Steamship company? - That's right. And I had the impression you were wealthy. You are sure you are not wealthy? Sure I'm sure. Does it make any difference? To me, difference? Of course not. What difference could it make to me? Se?or Blanca, there is another call for you. Oh, yes, a call. Right away. Uh, could you excuse me? Wait here, please. But don't play anymore. So, she was a wealthy girl. - No, look, Boris. - She owns half of America. - I can explain- - She loses thousands every night. Boris, please. My information-There was a slip. Yes, but luckily this time, Monte, you've landed on your feet... instead of where you usually land. This gentleman has offered to make good the young lady's losses. [ Chuckles ] Thank you very much, se?or. I, uh, suppose you have some way in mind that I can repay you. That, too, has been arranged. Oh, fine, fine. But killing is out. I will not kill! Look, Blanca. I'll make up the losses, but not all at once- payments of $500 at a time. Se?or, naturally I am more than grateful... but, uh, I still do not understand why. Well, not because of your character. After Miss Spencer went out with you last night, I looked you up. As characters go, yours is not very good. Oh, they're a lot of rumors. They are not true. Well, never mind. Miss Spencer seems to like you and to have a good time with you. For business reasons, I want her to continue to have a good time. The moment she stops having a good time, I stop paying Boris. And I wouldn't like that, Monte. Se?or, I assure you, you will have no cause to discontinue the payments. I will do my best to make Se?orita Spencer ecstatic. That ought to be good enough. You Cubans are supposed to be experts at romance. Oh, I am not a Cuban, se?or. I was born in Brooklyn as a child. But I have a feel for romance. Of course, uh, properly done, it is, uh, expensive. I understand. Here's, um, $50. When that's gone, I'll give you more, but no gambling. Oh, se?or, I would not gamble again if my life depended on it. [ Match Scratches ] And it does. [ Chuckles ] Hasta luego. - Place your bets, please. - [ Woman ] On four. - [ Clears Throat ] Ah! - All ready? I'm sorry I was detained so long, but I ran into the manager, so I wrote him a check. Then of course nothing would do but I should have a drink with him. - You know how it goes. - But I still feel guilty. What, about $3,000? Oh, forget it. [ Flores ] Fourteen, red. Fourteen, the winner. Oh, you know, I knew we should've stuck to that number. - It's come up at least five times since you left. - Really? - Well. - Oh, now look. You've spent enough for tonight. Oh, but this is nothing-just $50. Uh, $50 on 14. - No more bets, please. - Cigarette? [ Nan ] No, thanks. [ Roulette Ball Rattles ] [ Flores ] Twenty-two, black. Twenty-two, the winner. - Shall we go? - We should've gone long ago. - Uh, will you excuse me while I get my wrap? - Oh, but of course. [ Chuckles ] Thank you. [ Woman ] Uh-huh.! Now I have got you where you want me. Oh, Rosita m?a, never have you looked more lovely. And never have you looked more guilty! Where have you been? Shh. I have been here and there and smoking and thinking of you. And what did you think of your blonde? - Uh-The blonde? - Yeah, yeah. I am told you were upstairs with a blonde. But there are many blondes upstairs. If you stand next to a woman, it is 35-to-1 she is a blonde. It was not 35 blondes. It was one blonde. - Ah! Ah, you mean the blonde se?orita. - Mm-hmm. Oh, she is a friend of a business friend of mine, Se?or Williams. Business, huh? You are giving me the business. How many times have you promised me not to go upstairs and gamble my money? But I am not gambling with your money. I stroll up to the casino almost every evening, but only to test myself. I look on, I watch the little ball roll and it does nothing to me. I say, " Monte, you are cured. " Oh, to do that is to show character. Hmm, show me some money. Oh, you artists are all alike- temperamental, volatile, unreasonable. When I get my money back, I'm going to be very reasonable. - I'm going to make you scram and get a new manager. - Huh? [ Chuckles ] No, you will never do that. Where would you find another manager like me, huh? Mmm, that's right. No one can manage me like you do. But you are a thief and a no-good good-for-nothing. - Oh, but I like you. - Mmm. Oh, no, no. One more kiss, and I forget how to dance. - Run along. I will watch every movement from here. - Mmm.

Let's go away from this " eavesdripper. " Your blonde is on the chase for my manager. Really, Se?orita Rivas. I think you have the wrong impression. Besides, I'm sure that any interest Miss Spencer... might have in your manager is purely platonic. " Plutonic" or not, when I catch her, I'll pull all her hair out. Where are they? I- I haven't the faintest idea. Miss Spencer said something about attending a lecture on tropical fish. - Mm-hmm. - Anyway, I'm positive they're not around here. Then I'll sit and wait until the cows go home. Sometime she'll have to come back. Maybe Monte will not like her so much without any hair. You're much too concerned about this, se?orita. Why don't you just run along and forget the whole thing? I forget nothing, and I don't run. You can take my word for it. There's no reason to be jealous. Jealous? Who's jealous? I am not jealous. Well, if you're gonna wait around the lobby and ambush Miss Spencer... - someone is bound to get that impression. - With me, it's all business. I- If you don't mind my saying so... I think you're making a mistake following them around this way. - You have pride, haven't you? - Yeah. Yeah. I have it. Sometimes I have so much pride I could blow up. Then show it. Be independent. Get yourself a new manager. Oh, no, no. I could not do that. No one can manage me as well as Monte. - How do you know? - I have a feeling. That's only because you've never tried anyone else. You think so? That would be a good lesson for him, huh? Sure it would. Show him you don't need him. Yah. Yah. I will show him that. But where will I get a new manager? Uh, let's go someplace we can talk it over. Oh, no, no. I have no time now to go someplace. I have rehearsal. But tonight I can talk if you'll come to the casino. Don't you think the casino's a little crowded? Yeah. You're right. It's full of busy biddies. I know a little inn in the country. Arbolado's. - I'll meet you there at 10:00. Huh? - Fine. You better run along. I don't want you to be late for your rehearsal. - Why hurry? I am only late one hour. - [ Gasps ] - Huh? - Let's go through the kitchen. I always like to see what they're gonna have for dinner. I ride all around singing Buy a lollipop, buy a lollipop You'll hear my bell ringing Buy a lollipop, buy a lollipop Ah, se?orita, how many The moon on a stick for a penny You'll hear children echoing Buy a lollipop, buy a lollipop Merrily swinging along You all can be- Welcome, se?or. Welcome. - Is this Arbolado's? - I am Arbolado. Come in, se?or. Come in. You honor my house to enter into it. I'm looking for a young lady. I know a redhead. I could get her here in 10 minutes. No, no. I'm supposed to meet this young lady here. Se?orita Rivas. - Oh. You are the young man she's expecting. - Yes. She's upstairs. This way, se?or. This room down here is only for those who can't pay for anything better. " Tightskates" and the " cheapwads. " You know, se?or, this house is very romantic. The very famous pirate Morgan... used to come ashore here and make love to the wife of the governor-general. Their rendezvous was in this very room. Here is the marks made by his cutlass on the way in. You will find the champagne by the table. - When you are ready for supper,just ask. - Thanks. - Good evening, se?orita. - Ah. Buenas noches, se?or. Are you good at corks pulling? Well, most of my experience has been with beer cans. - Ah. Did you have any troubles finding the road? - Was that what I came over? You certainly picked an out-of-the-way place for our conference. You do not like this place? I think it's terrific. It has a nice balcony. Come to see. - You see? Nice, huh? - Mmm. Very nice. - And you said you did not want to be in a crowd. - Well, that was to avoid Monte. If you really want to teach him a lesson, don't see him. Have nothing to do with him. I have nothing to do with him plenty. And what kind of manager did you get for me, huh? Uh, rather good, I think. You're going to be a little surprised. Surprised? Ooh. I like surprises. They tickle me in here. - Well, I'm your new manager. - Huh? Now, before you say anything, listen. I've never managed any artist before... but I've had a lot of experience in management. - Yes? - And I'll really handle your affairs right. If I do say so myself, I'm a- I'm a good businessman. Never mind the buildups. I think I'll like you. - Thanks. - You are good-looking. Uh- [ Chuckles Nervously ] Thank you. You are big and strong. Well, I've had the usual childhood diseases... but I think I'm well enough to handle any deals that come up. - Kiss me. - What? - Kiss me. - Well, I guess we might as well seal the bargain. I guess. Mmm! I think you'll be a wonderful manager. - Oh. - I'm sorry. Oh, that's all right. That's all right. Uh, let us sit on the couch, huh? Well, d-don't you think I'd better order dinner first? - Oh, no. - Well, I didn't have any lunch, and I- - I better get 'em started. - I pour the champagne, huh? [ Arbolado ] Oh,yes, se?orita. This house is very romantic. You know that very famous pirate Morgan? He used to come ashore here... and make love to the wife of the governor-general. This was their rendezvous. - Maybe you're right. It- It is a little early for dinner. - Ah. Here. Now, come sit by me, huh? [ Door Closes ] I think we'd better go. Who is going? We have only just arrived. I know, but I'm tired of this place. I'm that way. I like to go places. You know, make the rounds. Oh, but I like here. The champagne is so good. - We are lonely. We're just two together. - [ Champagne Cork Pops ] Yeah, but we're liable to be four any minute. Oh, come sit down. We make rounds some other times, huh? - It's warm in here, isn't it? - Mmm. - We put the couch in the balcony. - Oh, no, no, no. - It's too much work. - Oh, no, no. There are rolls underneath. Look. - [ Wheels Squeaking ] - And you see? Somebody else do the same thing. - Come on. Help me. - Oh, we'd only clutter up the place. After all, they were there first. I wonder who they are. I will take one look like a Peeking Thomas. No, no. You mustn't. How would you like someone peeking at you? If I did not know, I would not care. - Well, let's just sit down in here. - All right. All right. Now, if I'm going to handle your affairs... there are a few things I'll have to know. Oh. You will find out little by little. No. We'll have to get this down in black and white. Now, what kind of a contract did you have with Monte? It was a verbal contract, but I tear it up. Well, how much commission did you pay him? Commission? He just took everything. Oh. That's not right. Ten percent is customary. Tell me. Do you have to wear those glasses? No. They're only reading glasses. Then you'll not need them. Take them off. I do not like it. Now... kiss me. Se?orita Rivas, it's been proven time and again. In- In business deals of this sort... things work out better if- if client and agent remain aloof. Maybe you do not like to manage me, huh? - Maybe I go back to Monte. - No. I- I'm crazy to manage- Then show it! Hmm. I know I go back to Monte. - Now do you think I can manage you? - Mmm! I give you 20%. Mmm! Mmm. [ Chuckles ] Somebody threw a cigarette on our balcony. Ah. Rosita, don't go out there. I knew it! I knew it! The minute I turn my back, you go behind it with the blonde, huh? Rosita, please. No matter what this appears like to you, it is the opposite. You stole! You lied! You gambled! And I'm stood for it. But not now. You are through. - I have a new manager! - No, Rosita. Please. What I have been doing I have done for you. You make me laugh. Ha-ha. For me, huh? For me you are chase with that little blonde " floogie"? - Hey. You can't call me a floozy. - Oh, can't I? - Floogie, floogie. - No, no. Please, Rosita. Listen to me. I have spent your money. I have lost at gambling. I have lied to you. - But never have I been untrue to you. - Yeah, yeah. I believe it. I have only gone with Se?orita Spencer because I lost your money. I was trying to earn some to give back to you. Se?or Williams paid me to take her out. - What? - What? Wait a minute. Come on, you. Come on. Is it true what this liar say? - Well- - Oh, so you had to arrange even this, you- you heel! Ah! And ah! Miss Spencer. Miss Spencer. You were in such a hurry, I thought you might have overlooked your check... so I took the liberty of calling it to your attention. Okay, okay. How much is it? Two bottles champagne, 9.90. Two suppers, $10. - We didn't have any supper. - Call it cover charge. - Oh! - [ Groans ] Stay out of this, will ya? Thank you. What's the big idea? You forgot your change, se?or. Miss Spencer. Miss Spencer, listen. - If you'll only listen. - Will you quit following me? I'm through with you. - I don't blame you, but if- - Oh! [ Vehicle Approaching ] [ Crash ] Well, I saw it coming at us, and I did the first thing that popped into my mind. - Oh. - For a moment I thought you lost your temper. I should think for a person as efficient as you... you'd put your brakes on when you park your car. - I thought I did. - Well, you didn't. Help me up. Oh. Take your hands off me. Hmm. Oh, I should have let it hit you. I've ruined my stockings. I'll buy you a new pair. In fact, I'll buy you a dozen pairs for saving my life. Size nine, coral sand. And you can send me a pair of crutches along with them. It looks like I'm gonna walk back to town with you whether you like it or not. Oh, I wouldn't feel comfortable without you trailing me. I'm sorry about that mix-up at Arbolado's. It's the first time a man ever had to be paid to kiss me. Well, you weren't having any fun with me... and you seemed to be enjoying yourself with Blanca. Well, at least he could dance, and he didn't show me any sugarcane. Well, all I can say is, again, I'm sorry. - Oh. - What's the matter? Blisters already? No, no. Gravel. These open-toed shoes weren't made for hiking. Thanks. - All I was trying to do was see that you had a- - Oh! Thank you. I wonder how many miles it is to town. Seventeen and 2/1 Oths miles. Oh. Oh, I give up. I've gotta sit down. Oh. Seventeen miles. My feet'll be worn down to the knees. I'd carry you before I'd see those beautiful legs wrecked. I guess I really ruined your vacation for you. You certainly did. I should have put you up at a hotel, given you an expense account... let you go on your own. - I was trying too hard. - I'll say you were. I've never seen anyone work so hard to have a good time. What happened to you anyway? Were you frightened as a child? Did your parents beat you? You don't seem to know how to enjoy yourself. Maybe I don't. All my life I've been so busy trying to get ahead... I never had time to worry about having fun. Well, when you have to worry about having fun, you're hopeless. I shouldn't be completely hopeless. I'm young yet, and I'm willing to learn. [ Chuckles ] You know, there's a possibility you're human after all. - Can I help you? - No. No, thanks. No sense in me putting this back on again. I'm here till we're rescued. Oh. Well, you might as well be comfortable. - Oh, no. You don't have to do that. - It doesn't matter. - There you are. - [ Sighs ] - That better? - Mm-hmm. - [ Snap ] - [ Groans ] What have you got in your pocket? Asupply of waivers? I don't know. Let's see. Oh. Oh, I broke your glasses. - Well, what's so funny about it? - Oh, I'm sorry, but I can't help being glad. You might have slipped into them any minute and ruined everything. Why does everybody hate these glasses? Because when you get behind 'em, you're a cold fish. The rest of the time you're sort of nice. Well, it looks like I'll have to choose between being nice... and being able to read my correspondence. Don't you think your chances of getting any mail out here are a little thin? Well, now that you mention it, we are sort of cut off from everything. Doesn't it make you a little nervous? No. Not a bit. - Why? - Mmm, I don't know. Anything might happen. [ Sighs ] That was right in character. Brief, cool and businesslike. Bet if your glasses weren't broken, you'd have 'em on. The last woman that made a crack about these glasses was practically decapitated. Tropical magic Strange fascination Moon of temptation In a black velvet sky Tropical magic Lost in your splendor Love will surrender - To a kiss - Then a sigh Whispering shadows Out of a midnight W hisper ma?ana But never good-bye Music is playing Tropical magic Here am I saying Adios to my heart Adios To my heart [ Bellhop ] Tropical magic, strange fascination Moon of temptation in a black velvet sky [ Humming ] Stop singing that song, will ya? Oh, I am sorry, se?or. You see, it is sort of a song one cannot get out of one's mind. - I didn't order breakfast. - I know, se?or, but it is noon. If you're not quite ready, it is all right. You see, I have the burners to keep the bottoms warm. All right. I'll eat it. I am hungry. But not that hungry. You've got two breakfasts here. Of course, se?or. One is for the young lady. I requested extra-large portions. What are you talking about? What young lady? - [ Chuckles ] Se?or. - There's no young lady here. Not even Se?orita Spencer? Se?orita Spencer is just a business acquaintance of mine. Se?or, you forget. I was on duty last night. I haven't forgotten it. I didn't even know it. When you come in, you had eyes for only each other. You bumped into a chair, but you did not notice. Your hands were locked. That, Se?or Williams, is no business connection. Besides, it was 5:30 in the morning. Our car broke down. It took us all night to get back to the hotel. And then, at the elevator, you stopped... and a long kiss ensued. No. That, Se?or Williams, is not business connection. You're right. That was pure insanity. - [ Knocks ] - Yes? - "Bonas"d?as. - Hello. Hello. Oh, I hope you didn't promise that other breakfast to anyone else. I'm famished. Well, as a matter of fact, I was just going to call you. I- I wanted to talk to you. I thought maybe you might have breakfast with me. Oh, I'd love to, now that I've invited myself. Hello. - Se?orita. - Thank you. Se?or. I will return with some more coffee... and- [ Chuckles ] and knock. - [ Laughs ] - Oh,Jay, darling. I'm so happy, I could kick my heels together. I've been doing a little kicking myself this morning. - Nan. - What, darling? - Eggs? - Oh. I'd love some. I don't know where I get all this appetite. Usually I never eat breakfast. Oh! Potato. - Aren't you gonna eat anything? - Eat? Oh. Yes. Sure. [ Sighs ] Wasn't last night gorgeous? You know, if I live to be a thousand, I couldn't forget a moment of it. - You couldn't? - Never. Neither could I. - Jay, darling. - Yes? - I have a present for you. - You have? Mm-hmm. The waiver. I wrote it myself. I said I'd sign it if my vacation was as good as I thought it should be... but it was better than I ever dreamed. Well, thanks, Nan. I would have given it to you whether I had a good time or not, but- Oh, I just thought I'd wait till the last day. But now, I don't want you worrying about business anymore because we're too happy. [ Chuckles ] - Sugar? - No, thanks. I never use it. - Oh. - [ Knocks ] - Come in. - [ Door Opens ] Good morning. I guess this is what I came to find out. Didn't even have to take my hat off. Well, good-bye. I hope to see you again sometime. Terry, wait a minute. Terry, what are you doing down here? Oh, I read a few cables on Father's desk. He was urging you on to a love affair, and you were reporting satisfactory progress. So I thought I'd better come down and see what you meant by satisfactory. - Now I know. - [Jay ] I don't think you do. Nan, I'm sick about this. I- I didn't want it thrown at you this way. No? Well, how did you want it thrown at me? Terry's my fianc?e. We've been in love a long time. Up until last night, there was no reason to tell you. It's probably hard for you to believe, but I was gonna tell you today. I'll say it's hard to believe. Why did you have to wait until today? I don't know. I just didn't. I don't know why. Well, I know why. You couldn't get this from me any other way, so you made love to me. Well, you just try to get me to sign another one! Nan, please. Oh, Terry. This is a mess. Honest. I didn't make love to her to get that thing signed. - Well, why did you,Jay? - I don't know. How do these things ever happen? Just say she's attractive, and there was a lot of moonlight, and- and I'm no tin god. I think we'd better go back to New York and get married as soon as possible. How can I? I still have to get that thing signed. You don't think she's gonna sign it now, do you? You're licked, and there's nothing to do but go home. I'm not going to give up. I'm gonna stay here till I get it. Now listen,Jay. It's about time you realized... that my wedding is more important to me than your stupid business. - What do you suppose my friends are saying? - Is that so important? Well, it is to me. Well, Terry, there's no reason to get so angry about it. I'm not angry. I'm furious. I'm going back on the afternoon plane. I'll drop in and say good-bye before I leave. [ Crying ] [ Crying ] [ Knocks ] Could you spare me a minute? Come in. Miss Spencer, there's been a lot of nonsense about this waiver. Jay's tried to woo it out of you, but I think we can drop that approach. All right. It's dropped. I have a cashier's check here for a thousand dollars. It's yours if you'll sign it right now. - Is this Jay's idea? - Yes. Well, why didn't he come to me himself? Well, naturally, he was embarrassed. You read more into his attitude than he meant to convey. I can't deny that. All right. Give it to me. Anything to get this over with. There you are. But you don't have to buy it from me. It's only steamship money. You might as well have it as the stockholders. You can consider it a sort of consolation prize. Of course, you realize that I know what you were really after. I think you'd better be leaving about now. It's too bad the shopgirl's dream is over. [ Knocks ] - For you, Se?or Williams. - Thanks. Just a minute. [ Laughs ] Thank you. [ Terry ] Rex Stallings came up for the wedding... but after the second time we postponed it... he had to go back home because his wife was getting a divorce. - What's that? - It's the waiver. She signed it and sent it to me. Why, that's wonderful. Congratulations. She certainly changed her mind in a hurry. I can't understand it. Well, you don't have to understand it. You've got it, haven't you? Yes, I have. It's a lucky break. I hope she's not too mad to see me and let me thank her. Oh, that would be a mistake. She's made her decision. Let it go at that. - Don't rake it all over again. - You're right, of course. - Now we can both take that plane back this afternoon. - Sure. - Monte. - Se?orita, I will apologize later... but if you want to save my life, let me in. - What's the matter? - Se?orita, I would never have been a party... to the recent deception if it had not been a matter of life and death. Now I am afraid it is going to be death. Death? What are you talking about? I only accepted Se?or Williams's offer... because I was in desperate need of money to pay gambling losses. When our romance stopped, se?orita, Se?or Williams's payments stopped. And Se?or Boris who owns the casino gave me 12 hours to pay up. And that was yesterday. So you can see for yourself that even now I am living on borrowed time. Oh, se?orita, please. I beg of you. Use your influence with Se?or Williams. Urge him to resume payments. After all, I did my best. And a good word from you might have the most desirable results. I'm never gonna see Se?or Williams again. Never. Then I die. When you leave, my body will be floating in the harbor. No, it won't, Monte. I think I can help you out. There's a thousand dollars in here. Oh, se?orita, you are clever. What a place to hide money. Oh, you do not know what this means to me. - There you are. - Se?orita, you're an angel. This is even more than I owe Boris. I will bring you back the change. No. Keep the change. I never want to see a cent of that money. Se?orita, I feel it necessary to get to Boris as quickly as possible. But afterwards, I will come back and express my gratitude properly. - [ Sighs ] - [ Door Closes ] - [ Knocks ] - Come in. Se?orita, a message for you. From him. I've seen enough shoplifters in my life. I should have known her type. - I'll show her. - Se?orita, what is wrong? That check. I've gotta find that- Oh. Oh! - Se?orita, where are you going? - To the casino. Monte.! Aha.! - So you are going upstairs. - Only to test myself. You are through testing yourself. It is too expensive! Querida m?a, how can I gamble when I have no money? When I have proved that with my own eyes, I still not believe it. No, Rosita! No! [ Giggles ] No. - Let me search you. - With me it is a question of dignity. - Can't you wait until you're asked? - No! No, Rosita. [ Speaking Spanish ] Come back here. Come back here. - [ Screams ] - Rosita, no! No. No. Rosita, por favor. Rosita, please. People are looking. They'll not be disappointed. I'm going to tear all your clothes off. - No, Rosita. Please. - [ Screams ] Excuse me, please. No. Por favor, Rosita. Pardon me. - Aha! - Aha! - Give it to me! - Oh. Excuse me. I will not. - Give it to me. - Ow! Ooh. You are an animal. You have teeth like a tiger. - And you have teeth like a snake. - [ Roulette Ball Rattles ] [ Flores ] Fourteen, red. Fourteen, the winner. [ Monte Gasps ] [ Whimpering ] This table is closed, se?ores. - [ Whimpers ] - What happened? - [ Coughs ] We have won. - Much? I don't know. Maybe I own the whole casino. Monte. Monte. - I hate to ask you, but I have to have that check back. - The check? - Yes. - Oh, yes. The check. Of course. Here it is. - Oh, thanks a lot, Monte. - Oh, no. Thank you for letting me use it. - When you kiss somebody, kiss me. - Please. Rosita. You have come at a very dramatic time in my life. I have just won a fortune, and I am never going to gamble again. - I'm not even going to match pennies. - What do you mean? You can make money this fast, and you are going to stop now? You are not a man. You are a fish! Rosita, you are telling me to gamble? Why should I have to shake my hips every night... sing at the top of my lungs when you can make money this easy? Look. This table's still in business. - Maybe I will own all of Cuba. - Mmm! Put them- Put them here. I might even have two suits. - [ Woman ] Have a nice trip. - [ Man ] We will. - [ Man ] Se?or Williams. - Yes? - For you, se?or. - Thank you. Yes, sir. - We're ready to take off, sir. Will you please get aboard? - Right away. Oh. So you paid Nan for that waiver. Well, you must have thought I was an awful dope... congratulating me for something you swung yourself. What does that matter? You got the waiver, didn't you? It's the way I got it I don't like. That's kind of a cheap trick, Terry. There's nothing cheap about it. I was willing to pay a thousand for it. Darling, please. They're holding the plane. - If you don't get aboard, we'll have to take off without you. - We're coming right away. What I want to know is why you did it. What in the world got into you? Let's get aboard. We can examine my motives all the way to New York. All right, but I still don't like it.

Well, don't think you can dance in here and square yourself with me in one breath. Well, I can try, can't I, sugar? Se?or, $500 would save my life. - It isn't worth it. - No? Well, make me an offer.
