MR MARSH: Tinker, tailor, soldier, sailor, rich man, poor man. Sheila's going to get married. That's what she says. Of course, she'll do a job in the meantime. She thinks working in an office, or serving in a shop. Something, doesn't matter what. It'll fill in the time, and give her some money for clothes and things. And Michael. What does he want to do? He wants to join the Royal Air Force and fly. He's only to hear an aeroplane and his head's in the clouds. And Joan. What does she want to do? And Jeffery, and Linda, and John. And Pat, and Trevor, and Valerie. And Lesley, and Susan, and Derek. What do they want to do? They are all different. They are all individuals. And the Youth Employment Officer has to remember this if he's to help. - Anyway, I know what I want to do. - Do you? Do you really know what you want to do? I don't suppose all your friends have made up their minds. Shall we see? That's better. (INDISTINCT MURMURING) All right, all right. We can get on without being in anyone's way. Now, let's see who knows what they want to do. (ALL CHATTERING) Who wants to work with their hands? To be makers and doers? Right, well, you form a group over there. Hold on, Derek. I might need you to interpret. Who sees themselves working in an office? Right, well, you form a group over there. You not sure? I'm not leaving at the end of this term, sir. - How long are you staying on? - A year, I'd expect. Perhaps longer. Good. Well, it might give you a chance of getting a better job. Anyway, you'll have longer to think about what you're going to do. Anyone else in the same position? Right, will you come and form a group over here, please? How many of you want the sort of job where you'll be constantly dealing with people? Giving a service. Looking after them. Right. Now, will you come and form a group down here? Now, listen now. ls there another group we can form? - What do you want to do? - I'd like to do some sort of designing. I'm quite good at art. Right, well, you form the artistic group then, over here. Is there anyone who knows what they want to do, but doesn't know which group to join? - Yes? - I want to be a hairdresser, sir. I don't know whether I'm a maker, doer, or what. Well, you'll certainly be making and doing, but I should have thought, on the whole, being a lady's hairdresser calls for people who are good at dealing with people. I think you better come on over here. - Yeah? - I'd like to work with animals. - You mean, work out of doors? - Yes, sir. Summer and winter. Do you think you're fit enough? Yes, sir, there's nothing wrong with me. All right. You start your own group, too. Those who want to work out-of-doors, who does that appeal to? I'd like to be an apprentice jockey, sir. - Would you? - (ALL LAUGHING) All right, all right, nothing to laugh at. Right. Now, the out-of-doors people, form a group back there. - What can I do for you? - We||, I'd like to be a nurse, but my mother doesn't want me to. She wants me to be a secretary. - Why? - We||, I had rheumatic fever when I was young. She thinks that all the standing about, you know, - would make me ill. - We||, then, perhaps for the time being, you'd better join the office group. We'll look at your medical history later. Now then, who doesn't know what they want to do when they leave? Right. Well, you come and form a group down here. Just for interest's sake, out of all the people who know what they're going to do, how many will be staying on for one or two extra years? Good. Yes, Derek? I was wondering how are you gonna help the "don't knows"? Everybody else has been taken care of. Now, wait a moment. Just because I've put them in a few groups doesn't mean anything's been settled. I haven't even started yet. Don't think they're all tied up in neat little bundles ready to be shipped off to their various jobs. Yes, sir, I can see that, but at least they know what they want to do. How can you help them? They're leaving at the end of the term. Well, if they kept an open mind about what they want to do, - it's sometimes a good thing. - I would have thought it better to know. But you might be choosing for the wrong reasons. How? Well, because you like the sound of a job, or because of what someone said. Or you just think you'll be good at it because you're good at a similar subject at school. We're growing up. We can think for ourselves, sir. (ALL APPLAUDING) Yes, I'm all for that. But do you know yourselves? Because knowing yourselves will save you a lot of unhappiness. It'll save you making too many mistakes. You can't learn much unless you make mistakes. And anyway, no one can know beforehand if they're gonna like a job or be good at it. But nobody starts with a totally blank sheet. Take yourself, for instance. Do you make friends easily? Yes, sir, I suppose so. But if you were shy, do you think you'd make a good, let's say, commercial traveller? MAN: Thank you, madam. WOMAN: And a tin of soup. SALESCLERK: And the next! - What would you like? - Tomatoes. And the next? WOMAN: And a small tin of baked beans. - Jam? - Yes, what do you fancy? - Oh, it's what you'd like, really. - Oh, well, try the old raspberry. Mind you, the bits get in the teeth, but it's very good. WOMAN: This size, dear? - Marmalade? - WOMAN: It's very nice. - Do you want any? - Try that one. Bags of peel. - It's what you'd like, really. - Oh, I'm a peel man meself. Now then, what's next? Here, let's have a look at that list of yours. It'll be quicker, won't it? Butter. Danish, English, Dutch, Australia, New Zealand? - We have them all. - You'll have them all? Good! Five, seven, nine... Now I'll tell a lie. Seven, eight, nine, ten, £11,14 shillings. £11,14 shillings. But I didn't come here to buy anything! I know! It sure mounts up these days, doesn't it? Pay on the way out, will you? Thank you! And the next? MR MARSH: You get the message, as you would say, don't you? - I get the message. - (ALL TITTERING) I want to ask you a question, Derek. Do you know the real difference between the child world and the adult world? It's obvious. Oh, I'm not talking about the obvious differences. When you were born, you didn't choose your family. You didn't have the choice of whether you came to school or not. But it's different when you go to work. For the first time, you'll have more independence. You'll have a wage packet. And some of you will be on your own for the first time in a world which isn't going to make any allowances for you, like your family or your teachers. How you do your job and the impression you make is what matters. - What do you want out of a job? - The usual. Do something interesting. - Get somewhere and have a good time. - BOY: We know who with. (ALL LAUGHING) Enough of it. All right. But seriously, - what do you all want out of a job? - Chance to travel. -Lots of clothes. Independence. - Something near home. - Short hours. - Long holidays. - Money. There are jobs with one or two of those things, but it'd have to be some job to include them all. (TYPING) Yes. You will start at £20 a week. Oh. That is, with a standard 10-hour week. If you report here at 12:00 noon, go to lunch at 1:00, after that the rest of the time is your own. You will have two months paid holiday a year. The firm will supply you with your own car, so that you may go from one works to another, in case you think you're staying in one place too long. Any questions? I said... MR MARSH: Feeling better? Look, money, the hours you work, the canteen, the annual holiday, they're all important. But you're going to be working for 40 or 50 years. You ought to be asking yourselves whether you're going to like what you'll be doing. And remember, if you think only about money, you may land in a dead-end job. Oh, I know it's nice to have a few pounds in your pocket and able to put down the deposit on that motorbike. - (TYRES SCREECH) - Oi! (ENGINE REVVING) I just come back for a quick look round the old dump! (MOTORBIKE ACCELERATING) (TYRES SCREECHING) Don't you worry about me! I'm doing fine! Go back inside and fiddle around with a lot of old nonsense! See where that gets you! See if it'll buy you this! What you want to do is to get out there as quick as you can and get the cash! (ENGINE REVVING) You can tell your mother what to do, and your father! You can tell the whole world once you've got the money. You don't need nobody! You're on your own! MR MARSH: You can get the money. Some employers pay young people quite a lot of money. And when they ask for more... If you're not satisfied with the wage I pay, I'll find somebody who will be. Don't you light that up in here! How many times have I told you? How much do you expect for the job you do? You're not trained. You do one job and you get paid the rate for that job. Then I'll get another job, with better money. You're not the first to say that to me. Can't you see you'd be better being trained for something? Do a job that'll get you somewhere? I haven't got time to mess about. I want the money, now! If you won't give it to me, I'll find someone who will. If you change jobs too often, you'll find it harder and harder to get the next one. You'll get a reputation as a drifter. You'll end up leaning against a lamppost outside some coffee bar! - What's that to you? - Nothing! I hate to see anyone mess up their lives at the age of 17! What will you do when you're 40? Take an ordinary day. After assembly, you move off to your classrooms. A perfectly ordinary everyday scene. What do you see? DEREK: Well, there's the Johnson mob for a start'. And there's old Cook on a scrounge, as usual. What a dodgy bunch they look. Don't they, though? Look like they just got out of bed. But not him. No, not him, not Whatsie. (DEREK EXCLAIMS) Where are the prefects? That's what they're supposed to be watching for. Don't say you're sorry or anything like that. That would be asking too much. Now where are we? Oh, yeah. The knitting room. Did you know, I've never been in there. Not surprising, really. Look at Susan. The way she's carrying on, she should be with us, doing woodwork. Volume of a cylinder. You tell me. DEREK: That's Mr. Picket, senior math’s master. Now, it's no use looking at the desk, boy. All I'm asking you to do is think. DEREK: He's got Cooper again. We must have done this hundreds of times. Hill? DEREK: He's a quiz kid. Area base times height. - DEREK: Clever dick. - Area base times height? Are you sure? DEREK: He ought to be on the telly. He'd make a fortune. - Yes, sir. - Good. DEREK: This is my group in the physics /ab. We were doing... Why aren't I in the picture, sir? - Did you want to be? - Of course. Well, we'll see it again. And this time, through my eyes. Are you one of a crowd? Or the leader of that crowd? Or do you like to be by yourself? Do you bulldoze your way through every situation? Or are you more likely to be tactful? Are you untidy and not happy doing intricate detail? Or are you neat and methodical? Volume of a cylinder. You tell me. MR MARSH: You get flustered when you have to make a decision? Now, it's no use looking at the desk, boy. All I'm asking you to do is think. We must have done this hundreds of times. Hill? MR MARSH: Or can you keep calm? Area base times height. Area, base times height? Are you sure? MR MARSH: Can you stick to a decision? - Yes, sir. - Good. MR MARSH: Can you concentrate? Or are you a dreamer? Of course some of us get bored, sir. Depends a lot who's teaching us. STUDENTS: Yes! And as for mental arithmetic, nobody's going to be walking up and down behind us at work asking us what the area of a parallelogram is. We're gonna say goodbye to that sort of thing when we leave! STUDENTS: Yes! You could leave school one day and start a job on the next! Do you think you're going to change into another person overnight? Simply by taking off your school uniform and putting on another uniform? By wearing overalls, a white coat, your best suit, tight skirt and sweater? It may give you a little more confidence, you may feel a little more adult, but deep down inside, you are still the same person. When you're combing your hair in a mirror next time, remember, you're not seeing yourself, you're seeing a copy, reflected on a piece of glass. And glass, like human beings, can disintegrate. It's rather unnerving to be out on your own, but you don't have to face it alone. There are always people who will give you advice. So, you're thinking of working in the engineering works here, are you? I worked there once. Not a good place, you know. Oh, not at all. Yeah. If I were to tell you some of the things that went on there, you wouldn't believe me. Wouldn't, really. - Think it's gonna rain? - Yeah. If I'm telling a lie, may I go under a bus. But, there was that day when the foreman come round when we got a bit behind with the orders, you know. That business with the mid-week football. Few of the fellows went wild, just a few of them. Danville went off. Well, when he found out... I wouldn't like to tell you what he said. The language! Haven't heard the like since the army. Got to go in now. I think I can hear my uncle. Hello, Uncle. Your mother asked me to pop in. Give you a bit of advice. Just I was thinking of engineering works, and what with you being there, wondered if you could sort of give me a bit of an idea on what to do. (SCOFFS) I'll give you more than an idea. I'll tell you exactly. Well, you see, there's this durable alloy tensile enshafting job, and what happens is this. There's two of us on the machine, and we get a load of spigots, with independent side suspension, and they have got to be forced, actually forced down through the retracting minor turtle. That's our name for them, other firms have got other names. Anyway, once they have been completely what we call "dragged," then, and not before, are they ready to go to the multi-loaded, pre-extracting soluble presses. They're in the next shop. They have to go by forklift truck, of course. - Of course. - Oh, they'd be too heavy to go by hand. - Naturally. - Mind you, you wouldn't be put on such a complicated machine as that, not to start with, of course. - I'm glad to hear it. - (EXHALING) And so am I. So much for the know-alls. But you'll get reliable information from the careers books in your school library. And your Youth Employment Officer can get the right people along to talk to you. But do you know one of the obvious and best places to look for help? Your parents. (ALL PROTESTING) All right, all right. I know you think they don't know and they've got all the wrong ideas, and they don't understand. But you'd be surprised what a lot they do know about you, especially in matters like health. One of you wanted to be a nurse, I remember. You had rheumatic fever. But if the doctor rules out nursing, you can still work with people, and care for them by getting an office job in a hospital. And that'll stop your mother worrying, too. - BOY: You want to meet my mother! - I meet a lot of mothers! And fathers, at the interviews. I must admit, there was one I won't forget in a hurry. Well, what do you want to do? Have you been thinking about it? Yes, I have. Dad would like me to go into the firm. Well, there are some very good jobs, but they need good qualifications. Looking at your report here, I'm not at all sure... - Do you mind? - I beg your pardon? That form, or whatever it is, I wouldn't bother with that if I were you. But it tells me how Brian's done, in his exams. Well, I know how he's done, don't I? I mean, I read his reports, don't I? Then you must know that he won't be able to get in with marks as low as these. (SCOFFS) Marks, exams, what do they matter? They're the things that employers often go by. (LAUGHS) Not with me there helping, they won't. As a matter of fact, this whole interview's a waste of time, really. I can get him in. I've already spoken to the man who matters. There'll always be some parents like that. Convinced they're doing their best. Most, though, fortunately, do give real help. And, of course, in school you have your careers teacher, and then there's your Youth Employment Officer. But don't make the mistake of thinking that he's some kind of fortune teller. FORTUNE TELLER: Oh, I can see a bright future for you, dear. Yes. Someone is talking to you. Oh, it's a very responsible job! Someone is asking you a very important question. He's coming up to you and saying... Oh, that's the end of the half-crown reading. MR MARSH: The Youth Employment Officer can get nearer the truth than that. Because of what he learns about you, and because of what he knows about the world of work. And when you're in a job, he's someone to turn to if it's not going well. For one thing, he's not as bound up in you as your parents. There are other ways he can help. There might be courses at technical colleges. After all, you don't stop learning when you leave school. He's there to help, but you can't expect miracles. He can't find you that special job unless you yourself can give something special. Giving isn't a bad note to end on. When you go to your job, are you going to see what you can get out of it? Or what you can give to it? The bell's due to go. You'll be late. (INDISTINCT CHATTERING) Sir? You know that bit in science you showed everyone of me dreaming? - Oh, that. Yes? - You know what I was thinking about? No. I was thinking all these years I've been looking forward to leaving this place, and now it's nearly here, I'm not so sure. You'll be all right. Subtitles by British Film Institute OCR by Pedotriba
