- Cover me. I'll handle it. - Okay. - Go, go, go! - Yeah! Your turn! - My battery's nearly out. Wait for me. - Okay bro. - Hey, you go create that room and wait. - Okay bro. Hey, why are you off school so early today? Damn, you won a rare set item? Shit, you must be topping up again. - Okay, we go heavy on this round. - How many copies for you? - Hey U! - Wait a bit Dad. Take the hill first. Go, go! Nice one! Let me get that, let me get that! Got it. Good! Just the house left. You got the grenade? Toss that grenade into the window. Cover me, cover me. I'll take charge, I'll take charge. - I'm in the house. - Nice! Just one left. Just one. Damn! Fuck, my girlfriend is calling. Wait for me. Hello, Gift? I'm gaming. I'll call back. Hey U, carry me! - What's that? - Carry me, my rank's down. Wait a bit. Wait a bit. Right now, it's still tense. Can't you see? Hey U, come and help first. The shop's full of customers. Wait a bit Dad, it's still tense. Excuse me. Hey U! U, send the report to Coach Tum tomorrow, and take the flyers and send them to uncle Thanet. - Okay, okay. I know, I know, I know. - And on your way back, don't forget to buy photocopy ink cartridges too. It's nearly empty. I'll go, I'll go. Done! Good one. Hey! Are you even listening to me? What did you say, Dad? U, and don't forget… U! You're here. - Two egg noodles. - Okay. PRINTER CARTRIDGE The usual one, Uncle. 4,800 baht. Hey, let me stop by this town to find bullets first. From behind, cover me. I'll get in, I'll get in. Behind the tree. Got the first one. Got the second. Last one, watch out for the explosion. They're coming. - Kheha Station. - Got them. Damn, take that! - Kheha Station. - Trying to take me from behind. Fuck. Fuck, went past it. Behind, behind the rock. I'll shoot it. From where? - Watch your back Pete. Watch your back. - Where? - The building in front. Left side. - Okay. - I'll go up and get it. - Be patient. I'm serious now, shit. - Take that from me, fucker. - Pete, don't go in yet. Pete! Fuck! Fuck. I died, fuck. I told you man. Fuck, it's just a fluke that he got me. Fuck. His stats are really amazing. U, come carry me. Wait a bit, I'm in a hurry. - Tonight, alright bro? - Meet tonight. - Okay, brother. - I'll ping you. What took you so long? The customers already left. Sorry Dad. You were gaming, right? You bought the wrong ink cartridges! These can't be inserted. - I'll go back and change… - No need. I'll do it myself. Why can't you be more responsible? Damn. That's a hardcore stat. MISSING A MEMBER. DO YOU WANT TO MAKE MONEY FROM GAMING? MEET ME AT RAMPAGE, SECOND FLOOR. You're I GOD U? Are you HOMEKILLIST? Follow me. Hey, bro. Is that Best? There's enough pro players to create a league, man. Fuck, so damn cool! I GOD U right? Come sit! Why are you're spaced out standing? Come sit! Are you GOD for reals? Are you MAD DOG PETE? You got a fan club! I was out a while ago, asshole. Goddammit. I'm Toy. You guys forming a team to compete? Are you interested? But I need to see first if you're really good. I'm telling you, He's on another level. What the fuck are you scared of? Got you, you chicken, fucker! I'm sorry man. I lost. So what if you lost? Who told you that you have to win? I just wanted to know if you're really good. Told you since the start of the game. Then that means, I pass? So I'm a player now? If you still want to. And what's the team's name? We don't really have a name. But we do have the page's name. THE UP RANK. We boost ranks. Isn't boosting ranks wrong? - Wrong as in against the law or what? - Wrong as in against the game rules. Yeah, it's against the game rules, but it's not against the law. Wow. You still want in? But boosting ranks is… You can go think about it first. No need to give me an answer today. I'm telling you that boosting ranks earns you more money than the pro players. In front, in front! Right there. What the hell? Chicken. Not following orders at all. Hey, you're still up! Hey, U, come and help me. I'm with these chickens. Look at this. Let's see. Here! You're the chicken. They're already good. Hey, these people are the chickens. I'm still skilled and still good. Oh wow, confident of your skills too! Yeah, they're good. Come and help me. Quickly! Just one round. Sure thing, just one round is enough. Quickly. Game on. Hey, if someone hires you to boost ranks. Will you do it? Of course. If you play games and also earn money too? So worth it! But boosting ranks is wrong man. Why are you being a pussy now? Even if you don't do it, someone else will still do it. You're such a pussy. Where did you go? You're a grown up already, you should learn to be responsible. Oh… Follow me! Quickly. Look who's here. Holy shit, you really showed up! So, how do you boost ranks? Normally all our clients are those that want high ranks. But they don't have good skills on their own, so others look down on them. Those people will contact us through THE UP RANK page, where Toy is the admin. Hey, there's a client who wants a Conqueror rank ID. Once the client's done talking about their ranks, we use their IDs to play. So where do I have to jump in? Anywhere where there's lots of people. Farm quickly, kill quickly and quickly collect kill points. You got it? Once you jump down and others shoot at you, just quickly kill them. It's not just us who are boosting ranks. So we don't shoot the chickens first? If you play normally, yes, but don't forget we're working. If there's a chance to get rid of threats, then it should be done, no? And when their credit's lost, clients will hire a better team than us. - Where's the gun? - Home, it's just you left. Hey, what are you doing? If you know that you're not going to win this round, just quickly restart a new match. So you don't waste time. Each rate for each rank varies by the ranking levels at the start. Most customers will purchase from us from Bronze rank, all the way up to Conqueror rank. The average price for each ID is THB10,000. If we each get 7 IDs per month, together we will earn around THB280,000. Deduct costs here and there. Divide this and we'll each get around THB50,000 each month. Clients get their rank, and we get the cash. Smirking? Why are you smirking? Cheers! - Hello? - Hello Gift. Are you free on Friday? Oh, didn't I tell U already that I'm working on an assignment with Orm? So what's happening on Friday? Ah, nothing. I wanted to invite you to have a meal with my friends. Friends… friends from where? Friends from work. So you finally got a job? What is it? You will find out soon enough. Well… I'm busy these days. Why don't we meet this Saturday? Bring your new friends since we're already meeting anyway. What's happening on Saturday? I can't believe you forgot my birthday again! Who said I forgot? Who would forget their girlfriend's birthday? Don't be silly. Alright, bye then. BANK'S ASSETS Home… this is Dad. How have you been? You're doing alright? Once this side's settled, I will come back to visit. Hang in there, son. - I'm off Dad. - U, deliver this to Thanet first. He will need to use it this afternoon. Isn't Uncle Thanet at Ladprao? Is it worth sending it there? He's a regular client. It's no big deal. Just go. If he's in a hurry, he would come and get it here himself, Dad. You don't get it, do you? When people do business, the first thing you need to do is win the clients over. Do you know? Here, your car fees. It's fine Dad. - How much? - 500 baht. Wear this now. We're late because of you. What's that? Go, don't ask. - Where are we going? - I've waited a long time already. - Get in the car. - Pass the bag over. Are you for reals? That bastard is interested in us. He said you're very handsome. That fucker just now? I'm kidding. Hey, what are you up to? Drawing. Wow, that looks beautiful. Have you taken classes before? Nope. - Really? - Just drawing for fun. I think you can sell this. - Sell it? - Yes. I think you're exaggerating. Really. You can't be serious. Hey, let's go somewhere else. Follow me! Home, come! - Yo, I'll pick the place myself. - Don't interfere Home. Trust me. If a shop is good… I'll stop like this! This shop here. Let's go! Man, I knew it. Shit, today's Saturday. GIFT There's a cake? Make a wish! I will send it over soon. Alright, bye. What's up? Not having fun? It's nothing. No fun? Can I ask you something? Why did you pick me? I don't know if you see yourself as good or not. But I don't know many people who played over 4,000 hours. To boost ranks, being just good isn't enough. You need to be crazy too. If we deliver all the jobs, where do we find more customers? The first one or two years, I asked the same questions as you. But if you notice… the new customers that come in at first… Nobody wanted to get that high of a ranking. Everyone just wanted a Diamond or a rank that's better than their own, right? But as days goes by, nobody wants to have a low rank. Do you know why? Because they realize that what they get from us is not just a rank. But it's about being able to reach a higher position than they would have been able to get. Once people get to be in a high place, nobody wants to go down. That's why our business is like a well that will never be dry. In the end, these people will still hire our team. Come on, stop being paranoid. Hey, I'm not paranoid. - This is called paranoia. - Time to fucking drink beers! What took you so long? Calm down gents… Let's drink. - Not going to say cheers? - Of course. Cheers! - Leave me alone! - You got a big mouth, don't you? Fuck you, this is my girl! - So what if she's your girl? - Come and get me! Hey, they're fighting. Go help them out! - Come get this, fucker. - Come on, let's go. Damn, U, are you really a God or what? You're a God or you got knocked out, fucker? Shut up man, you were the first to run Pete. Fuck, he was huge, man. Don't think too much Toy, we all make mistakes. Home, that should be my words, no? Why don't you say it then, who's stopping you? Shit. Fuck you. Oh look, damn U is sleeping. Shit, he's sleeping right here! - U! - U! Fuck, U! Why are you here? Surprising you. Surprise? Are you joking? I've been so busy with work these days. In this condition? Going to work like this, U? Well… I'm working by playing games to boost ranks. You told me to find a job. So I'm here working as you wanted. Playing games, boosting ranks? You call that a job? At least… I got money… to celebrate on your birthday. What do you want to eat today? Tell me and I'll treat you. How can you pretend like nothing has happened? Are we really going to continue on like this? - Come on Gift… - Just leave. It's just a birthday. Why make it such a big deal? Do you ever care about my feelings? Am I ever important to you? Of course, you are! If you're not important, why would I come all the way here? Just leave. Gift… - And don't you ever see me again. - Gift… Yes, I'll get it done for sure. But tomorrow can you please find a person to collect this? I don't have anyone to send this. Sure. And… got it, but… Hold on. I'll get back to you later. Where the hell have you been? You need to come talk to me right away. What the hell do you want to do? You don't go to class. You don't help me work. What the fuck are you going to do? Are you ever going to do something good with your life? Stop right there, U. Come out and talk with me at once! Are you really going to keep on like this? I'm not going to be with you forever. If I die, will you have the means to survive? U! Happy birthday! Wow, is this for reals? Can you tell me what you wished for? It's a secret! Let me guess… You wished… to be with me for a long time… Right? Something like that. Something like that, like how? I wished to celebrate my birthday with you every year. U, head to the mark. I already marked this. U, U. Head to marked place. U, to the mark! Hey, I told you, head to the marked place… Fuck! We're all dead. What the fuck's wrong with you? You look out of it! I'm sorry. Fuck! Home, there's a Silver rank ID request. They want a Conqueror rank in four days. Can we handle this? Conqueror rank in four days? Are you crazy? You're going to take this? Look at how this fucker's playing. If they can double the payout, accept it. Damn it, lots of jobs going on too. They are willing to pay. Come talk to me on the rooftop. What's wrong? Can you tell me what's up? I'm doing okay. Okay. Issue at home? Relationship? What happened? She doesn't understand me. I… I'm taking this job for her. She wants me… to have a goal in life. Be successful in life. Have a career, something like that. So that is what I'm doing for her. I'm doing that right now. How am I not doing that? I get you. But you need to stop expecting everyone in this world to understand you. You don't need to make everyone believe in what you're able to achieve. You just have to believe in yourself. Once you're able to do this, there will be so many others waiting to be by your side. Push forward. Go, go go! All out! So much left to do, how can we finish in time? Next station Phahon Yothin. Dad! Dad! Fuck. Dad! Dad! Dad! Dad! Excuse me please. How is my father, doctor? I feel this is a symptom of heart disease. I will have to transfer your father to the cardiologist. Hey, I'm alright, it's nothing too serious. Let's head back. But Dad, it would be good to check. No, it's nothing too serious. I just need to take some meds and I'll be fine. - Thank you. - Sure. Let's go. Mr. Aium, please proceed to pay your medical bills with the cashier. PHARMACY - PAYMENT It's 800 baht in total. Where did you get your money from? From working, Dad. Someone hired me to play games. Hired to play games? That exists? And it's okay? You don't need to worry, Dad. I'm a grown-up. You think you can really keep doing this forever? You're here earlier than usual. I'm not here today to pay my debts. I'm here to borrow more. How much do you want? Just a million. I know well how much I owe you. But if I get this funding… I will return both the cash and interest to you much sooner than you realize. I don't care what you do with this money. Just make sure you return it to me in full. Got it. Why the fuck are you buying so many? Where the hell did you get this, motherfucker? Are you out of your mind, Home? You're late. I'm very disappointed. Come listen together. I'm sorry. Think about it, we have just four players. Each month we earn THB50,000 right? And what if… we have 50 people? How much will that be a month? What do you mean, 50 people? Instead of us playing the lowest rank to the highest rank. We'll find a group of kids to work with us through these phones. Get more work done, plus not waste any time. Hey bro, I know a kid. What's the rank? And how are you sure these mobile phones won't be stolen? Very easy. We'll confiscate their ID cards. As a collateral that they won't cheat us. And we'll let them take our phones to boost the lower ranks. And have them return our mobile phones when we hand them the cash. Wow, thank you, bro! What about the higher ranks? - What do we do? - I got this covered. I'll send Pete to join the e-sports team. And secretly recruit the pro players to boost ranks for us. We'll let those fuckers… take the difficult clients, the high ranks. And we'll keep 30% from both the kids and the pro players. In total, we'll cash in THB300,000. It's a win-win for everyone. - See you after the next lot! - Thank you! U, you're free? Well… I'm done with all my work. Then you're free right now. - Go back. Go back. - I got this. - They're on the right! - Damn! - Fuck, why didn't you even look? - Fuck. Why the hell are you playing like this? What the fuck are you playing at? How many months have you spent training? Playing all over the place. How are you going to beat anyone? Pete, you play like shit. Do you really want to come back as a pro? Fuck Pete, what the hell is wrong with your gaming today? You're really shit at this! CALLING TOY CALLING TOY All done! Got to eat chickens for the win. Got to eat those chickens all because I got my friend's help. We'll eat the chickens for dinner again with my friend. See you later soon. Bye-bye! How was it? Fun? - It was okay. - See? I told you it'd be fun. All I see is people praising U. - Is that right? - Yeah. They're asking if U is a pro player or not, he's so great at gaming! You're making this up. I don't see it at all! It's true! WHEN ARE YOU CUMMING BACK? A TASTE OF THAT ONCE AND I'LL BE GRATEFUL FOREVER. LOWER THE CAM A BIT, FOR THE GOOD OLD TIMES. STILL ACCEPTING BOOTY CALLS? Toy, how can put up with these terrible comments? Forget about it. Are you hungry? Let's find something to eat! U! Let's go now! How is that beautiful? It's not just about the surface. Each person has a different view of what is beautiful. Whatever you say. I guess you really like going to these events. These art exhibitions. Yes I do. I've been drawing for a long time. If I have the chance, I would love to take some art classes. Then go for it! It suits you Toy. I'm still saving up. Don't touch that! You're not allowed to do that! Really? What about you? Is there anything else you would like to pursue? I don't think so. I spend my days gaming away. With your skills, why don't you try to be a pro player? Me? A pro player? I don't think so. Why not? Just go for it. I think you can probably do it. I won't make it. That's beautiful. Can you take a photo for me? You call that beautiful? That's beautiful for sure. Very beautiful. Whatever you say. I'm ready. How is it? Beautiful. Did you take one yet? Let me see. Fine, it looks good. Thanks for today. See you later. Bye-bye. Where did you go? Had a meal. Just out walking around. With U? Why? Are you jealous? I brought you duck noodles. This shop is really good. Wow… There's no need to buy food for me. I can take care of myself. But, I appreciate it. I just happened to pass by around here, so I wanted to drop by to see you. So what have you been up to these days? Well, I'm trying to come up with some cash. If you're trying to get this house back, that's not going to be easy at all, Home. It will require a lot of cash. Uncle, you're talking as if I don't know this at all. Why wouldn't I know this? Can you just give me some more time? I'm on your side here. But the bank head office will finalize the decision on this house very soon. I think you need to accept this. Did you get knocked out? Do you want me to help? - It's done. - Okay. Yes, coach. Home. Pete hasn't been showing up for training for many days. Do you know where he is? Right now he's really a burden to the team. Didn't you tell me he's a responsible person? I only took him in because of you. You made a promise to me, but why is he such a mess like this? Coach, please calm down. Please give me around five minutes to call you back. I'll check up on where he is. Handle this quickly. My patience is limited. Noted sir. Or else I'll have to remove him from the team, understood? Got it, sir. What's wrong? Pete's not turning up for practice. - What? - Toy, do you know where he is? I'll call him now. Pete, where are you? At the bar? You're out drinking? You're causing troubles for others, Pete. Are you even listening to me? I thought your FULL STOP team's training, no? Why are you sitting here? I'm exhausted. Fucking exhausted from what? Being a pro player is not who I am. Don't you think others are exhausted too? I already reduced a ton of work for you. You don't get me at all, do you? I don't understand? I think you're selfish. And if you continue to be this selfish, our team will surely be bankrupt. Go back to the practice tomorrow. Don't let them fire you. And don't ever forget what your role is. - I really must go, is that right? - Yes. Fine, I'll go then, fuck! Thank you, sir. Hello. Hello, Pete. What's up? Are you almost done with all the jobs? I'm doing it right now! And don't forget to go to the practice today, so they don't come and complain. Are you even listening to me? Fuck! Do you even want to know about how I'm doing? Pete… What do you want from me? I'm already busy as hell these days. Fuck! If you have nothing else to say, I'm going to hang up now. You... - You see it? - I see it. - The tree, the tree. - Already knocked down. Why hasn't Pete submitted his work? Must go. Must run. Come down! - Hey Toy, you got a potion? - Yeah. - Give me the potion. - Okay. Okay. There's another party. Right in front! Fuck. What do we do now? Can you handle it? What the fuck is wrong with you? Scoot over. We're surrounded. - Can still make it. - Okay. - Can you make it? - Yes! Yes! Knocked already? - Yes, yes. - Okay. My ammo's out. Got ammo, U? Pete, I'm working. That's enough! Pete, I said I'm working, can't you hear me? - That's enough, Pete! - Why haven't you submitted your work? Why haven't you sent in your work? All done, as you can see. Did you go to the practice? You're damn consistent. Have you ever wondered why the good pro players and the good teams can't stand you? But I think what you should be more curious about is why you can stand your pathetic life like this every day. - Pete, stop this now. - What the fuck is wrong with you man? - Go outside first. - Why don't you stay out of this? - Stay out of my way. - Go outside first, don't start this. You go and take over Pete's jobs. I can barely finish my jobs. You have to do it. You will do it. Then it will be completed. - Hey, fuck man! - What the hell is wrong with you? You're always like this when you're drunk. - Always? - You come and talk to me outside. What's wrong Pete? What's got into you? You want to know? Pete, I told you to stop! Fuck! Playing hard to get? Because of U? You think I'm stupid? I know the two of you are secretly dating. What the hell are you talking about? You know he likes you. You baiting him too? You want to fuck him? Quit being an asshole Pete! If you don't tell me what the hell is wrong with you. Get a hold of yourself, and come back and talk to me later. You whore. Fuck! HOW ARE YOU? ARE YOU OKAY? Why are you so stupid? You guys. What are you doing? You go ahead and send this. Just capture my username then. Have they banned me ever? - One margarita, please. - Sure thing. Are you Pete? Yes. Play for me as well. And if I play for you, what do I get in return? If you play for me, I'll play something else of yours. Fuck, I didn't know she's underage. And she's asking for 500K in cash. You can see my face so clearly. What should I do? If the team finds out, you're going to be fired for sure. Why do you like to get everyone in trouble all the time? You never think about others at all. Fuck. I didn't know she was underage. So what would you like me to do? Just come up with 500K for you? Fuck, you got to help me out. I don't want to go to jail, buddy. I beg you. I'll find a way. But in the meantime, can I ask something from you? Go back to practice, and try to earn the trust back from other pro players in the team. Can you do that for me? - Of course, man. - Sure? Thanks a lot, buddy. You guys don't need to be afraid. We'll try to fight them in the training room. If we can't handle this, we can change plans later. All I ask, is you just do your best. We're not afraid of the other teams. More afraid about this fool around here, sabotaging us. Yeah, you're damn right. The kids are sending their work very late. What is taking Pluto's team so long? Probably busy with exams maybe? Exams my ass during this period. Anyway, I'm asking you guys to speed this up. Because it's almost the re-rank period. And what about Pete's work? Is it almost done? It's nearly done. Sup? Is this my work? Let me handle it. That hand of yours is free. Pick that mobile phone up, will you? I'll take you home. What the hell is wrong with you? Get over here. You're still mad at me? Huh? Answer me. What the fuck is wrong with you? Let's breakup, Pete. Breaking up? I no longer have any feeling for you. And you probably don't really love me anyways. You don't feel it, huh? - What about this? Feel anything? - Stop doing this to me, Pete. You want me to stop doing this? This fucking disgusting behavior? Then what about your disgusting video clip? Let me ask you something, damn it. Has U seen it? The video clip. Huh? So what? I have a leaked video clip, so what? Is it so fucked up that I have to ask you to tolerate this? And if it's not me, then who else can? All this time, I really thought you were the person that understood me the most. But you… You're just like the others, Pete. Go the hell back home. Like the others? When are you going to pay me back? Can you give me until next month, please. Right now I'm really a little short. Next month I will give this to you plus interest. If you don't pay me, you do know… what's going to happen to you right? You can get out here. Damn Pluto and the kid's gang haven't submitted their work for weeks. And? So you need to check on them to see what's going on? Me? Don't forget that you still owe me from saving you for fucking that girl. Go and make sure they send their work on time. Fine…I'll go check them out. Fuck. Hey! What the fuck are you doing? Toy. You're here early today. Are you alright? It's nothing. Let's go inside. Have you been side hustling jobs yourself? - I didn't do it! - If you didn't do it, - then who's doing what I saw? Huh? - I really didn't do it. How dare you to say that, motherfucker. How about you take this, you piece of shit? Hey, what the hell are you doing? Your kid, he's side hustling. - Come on bro, I did nothing like that. - The fuck you didn't. - Hey! Stop it right there! - Stop blaming others, Pete. What the hell? He's just a kid, man. Pete, stop blaming the kid. Stop blaming others, Pete. Are you guys colluding? You also want to join him too? Huh? Fucker. - Hello. - Hello Home. Why is my ID banned? I hired you to up the ranks. What the hell did you do? - Why am I banned? - Pete! - You. Sit here. - What did you do to my ID? Oh, hold on right there. Initially there can be several reasons to get banned. - In that case I will… - Go find an ID for me right now, or I'll get back at you. You think you're so good, huh? Why did you guys come in together? Hey bro! It's fine. If you do this again. It won't end just like this. Do you understand? Do you understand? Go home now. You're letting him go this easily, Home? Fucker. Nexus called and said his ID got banned. And you're playing his account right? These past three months, 70% of all your salary comes from this one guy, alright? Your chains, your clothes, your shoes, everything that you buy. How can you do this to the team? This fucker also played his ID, no? Whenever this fucker played, were there any fucking incidents? It only happens when you play. And you don't believe me? So this is how it's going to be for you? You too? You also? Fuck you all. Fuck you! Where do you think you're going? Don't butt in, you shit. Fuck you! I wonder how long you can last. Fucker. Punk. And that ID that got banned… What are we going to do? He only has one condition which is to trade… for a Conqueror ID rank with all the rare items. And who will have that kind of ID? You're going to give me that ID right? Give me a delightful answer. U. Are you okay? About that ID that got banned, it might be because of me. Don't worry too much about it. You gave your ID to him already. The work vibes right now are no fun at all, right? I think I will take art classes. What about you? Is there anything you really want to do yet? Right now, there's a pro-player team that's opening for new applicants. Then go for it. What are you waiting for? But they said you need to have at least an Ace ID rank. I don't have that anymore. But we boost ranks for a living, U! It's so simple. You can do this for sure, no? How about this, let me take you to this place. This is only a friendly match, but it's not any different from the real match! - The area's about to enter phase eight. - So many people are here. Yeah. Isn't it awesome? Right now Full Falcon is in a very tight spot, unable to circle in. Yes. From the looks of it last time, Full will need to bring in the smoke. Toss that flashbang to get in the zone. Oh, and it happened ladies and gentlemen. Full Falcon is down and out of this game. This makes it down to just KOG and Heaven Shot. Wow, these two teams are really evenly matched! But right now team KOG is in a tight spot. That's because Heaven Shot's position is more favorable. And now, on Best's end. Under fire earlier, but was able to hit back and knocked em' all down! It's decision time. Seems like Goddard crossed the hills to shoot behind Best. But at this moment, Best knows better and returns fire! Finally, it's Best who takes Heaven Shot to victory and becomes the champ today! So what do you think? Do you like this? Thank you, Toy. JOIN THE TEAM - Thank you. - Thank you very much. See you soon. - Great game play. Great game. - Thank you. Next two in line. Please come inside. SO DAMN SLOW TO SEND IN THEIR WORK. SO FUCKING SLOW. THESE IDIOTS! Home, we got another four ID requests. Shall I decline them? Take them. You're still going to take them? We can't even finish what we have right now. We don't have any pro players to help you play ever since Pete left. And if you take all these jobs, who's going to play for you? Just take it, Toy. CHEAPER. FASTER. ON DEMAND. BOOST RANKING SERVICE. I'm looking for Mr. Aium Tangcharoenkit! Which room is it? One moment, please. How's my father's condition, doctor? There's a blood clot inside the heart's artery. But right now, I have administered medication to remove the blood clot. In short, in this case, the patient will need to undergo a coronary bypass surgery. I recommend not delaying the surgery more than the end of this month. But if the symptoms act up again… I recommend performing the surgery right away. How much will it cost? It will be around 300,000 to 400,000 baht. From here on, you will need to closely look after your father. - Sure. - Please make sure he takes the medicine… Understood. God damn. That's strong. So you're the fucking boss now? Do you really hold this much grudge against me? You stole my customers like this, don't think that this is going to end well for you. Can an irresponsible punk like you manage a fucking rank boosting page? Well, isn't this Home, THE UP RANK? Are you here to find more customers? You started this with me, so you must finish this with me. I ain't going nowhere. Don't you forget, if it wasn't for me rescuing your ass from that underage girl, you wouldn't be sitting here right now. Isn't that right? Damn, I'm so scared. You think I'm stupid? Underage? Really? First! Home, you took her seat. I'm going to ask you one more time. Are you coming back with me? Give me a good answer. Is that all? You're dismissed. If you can hire, then I can hire as well. Let's make a toast. Let's ignore this fucker. I thought you asked me for a meeting? My clients still haven't transferred me the money. Can you please wait? You have been a business owner for more than 10 years before me, surely, you do know that… sometimes things are a bit delayed, right? Please, I'm begging you to give me one or two more days. You don't need to go this far. So, do I have to wait for you again? I give you one month. Understood? Is that clear? Hello? I GOD U 2, you are qualified for the recruitment of HEAVEN SHOT team. Please prepare the documents as mentioned previously. Okay. And tomorrow there's a team meeting at 10 a.m. You can start to come in to train right away. Sure, thank you very much. Congratulations. Good bye. Damn. Why won't she leave? Hey, what are you doing Pluto? Hey! Hello? Jackson? Fuck, I'm KO'd. - Just one left. Take him, U! - On it. - Hey nice! - Nice one! - Man, you're really good! - Yeah, you're really great. Hey, hey guys. - What is it? - Did you guys see the news? What news? Pete from FULL STOP team had a car accident. - Hey, seriously man. - Here. - Is this real news? - It's real. - When was the accident? - Just last night. In a deep coma. The issue is there will be a tournament soon too, no? - I don't think he'll make it. - Who's going to sub him? I'll catch you later. Come and talk to me. - Why did you take the pliers? - What pliers? I'm asking why you took the pliers? - What the hell are you talking about? - Answer me. - What are you talking about? - Why did you take the pliers? Look at this. Open your eyes and watch this at once, asshole. Watch this. Can you see it? Can you see what you have fucking done? Huh? You want revenge against Pete? Why did you do this? Do you know? If you get caught, you're going to jail? - What about your grandmother? - What about your life? At first Home said it will only hurt just a bit. I didn't think it would be this severe. Help me please, what should I do? I really didn't mean to. Oh, you guys are already here? You really want him to die? What? Pluto told me everything. The kid is still young, come on. And why the fuck are you butting in? That's none of your business. He's my bro, man. Why did you have to go this far? You don't like this, Toy? Pete did a lot of shitty things to you, man. But that's not the point! Even if Pete treated me like shit, I never wanted to get even with him as you did. I just got a work deal that is cashing twice the reward. Won't you guys want to stay and work together? Don't you want the money? Don't you want the money as well? That's all you ever think about right? I really want to know as well. With the kind of face like yours. Like your kind. How can you escape your own past? What's my fucking past got to do with this? You can probably find a way where you can build a new future. But let me tell you, the moment you walk out of this door, no one in the world will let you in again. Because no one sees any value in you. Dear, you don't even see your own value. Why are you saying something like this? You might just be… just like your ex used to say. On the rooftop when you guys talked. I heard it. You're a whore. For the team, aren't you just a little whore? Isn't it that? U, You're really going to stay and do this with him? Then go ahead and do it! 200K by this month, can you find it for me? I can find it for you, but do you have the ability to get the job done? We have to boost ranks for 20 Conqueror IDs within two weeks. You and I, we're splitting 10 each. 10 IDs in 2 weeks? Are you out of your mind? Do you want the money or not? From here on, you and I will have to boost ranks everywhere, all the time. No breaks. If you think you can't do it, you have to find someone else to do it in your place. And split that cash among yourselves. Hey Best, brother. Yo, what's up? It's nothing bro. See you around. I'm heading out. Behind the river, behind the river. Go! I'll have a go. Cover me too. Don't you think that this is the first time ever in your life that you actually have a clear goal? So don't let any fucking distractions get in your way. Do you remember when you first lost to Pete at RAMPAGE? Back then I just wanted to see someone who wants to win. But right now I want to see the real victory. And if you can succeed, this will change your life. But if we can't make it, then it will be game over for us. Fuck! All the information is in here. I don't think Home will stop any time soon. I think you know well what kind of person he is. I think this full data leak is probably the only thing we can do to stop him. But… you might have to leave HEAVEN SHOT. You need to make this decision on your own. Here's the first 200K you asked for. But I want you to finish 10 more IDs. Can you do that? Does HEAVEN SHOT know that you're boosting ranks? Not yet? Are you blackmailing me? Let's do this! We must win today! Hey U! Enter the game. It's about to start. Why are you spacing out? What's up with you today? Let me know if anything is troubling you, we are friends regardless. - Thank you, bro. - So you're okay? Let's start. U… U. Oh, Dad? Did they say when I'm going to be discharged? They said that you must go through with the surgery Dad. I can't… You know we don't have that kind of money. You don't have to worry about the money Dad. I'll take care of it. I don't want to. I really want to go home. I don't want to get the surgery. But it's already paid for Dad. Paid for? How? That costs a fortune. Where did you find that kind of money? From playing games. How can you make that much money in such a short time just from playing games? Son, is something wrong? Is there something you would like to tell me? I don't know if I'm doing the right thing or not… If you think what you're doing right now is good then keep doing it, son. But you need to be brave enough to face all the consequences as well. I believe in you, son. Hey man, turn on the news! Hello? Hey, have you seen the news? My ID got banned. I just lost 10K! Tell me how you will compensate me! THE UP RANK web page has leaked the customers' information publicly. Causing many gamers' IDs to be banned by the game licensor. Directly impacting a group of customers who took a loss Fucking U. From investing in this web page. The big loss from this leak is estimated be over a million baht. What about my ID? It's this fucker! Where do you think you're going? Be responsible man! Hey, follow him. It's this fucking guy. Where do you think you are going? What's the hurry? It's you isn't it, that got my ID banned? Let's beat his ass. Take responsibility for your actions, fucker. Asshole! Hey, what are you all doing? Stop. I told you to stop! Stop right there! Do you know how much money I lost? My game ID got banned all because of him. And now others have access to all of my game and email passwords, - thanks to this piece of shit. - Calm down, calm down now. ID is about the game. That's one thing. But you actually assaulted him. And how am I not the victim? - He's injured. - But sir, I lost a lot of money too! You can't press charges because it's just a game that kids play. It's not illegal. IGODU2 BANNED FOR VIOLATION OF RULES BEFORE HEAVEN SHOT ESPORTS EVENT STARTS You had me waiting for one month… and two hours. And that's a wrap with HEAVEN SHOT who were able to win the tournament once again despite switching a player at the very last minute. I'd like to get a photocopy. - Sure thing. - Dad, I got this. Five copies, please.
