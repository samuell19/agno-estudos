You, uh, know anything about the man who owned that Taylor? Vaughn Jackson. Lead singer of Army of Love. You're his sister, right? Vaughn and I, we met Pedro in school, and we formed Army when we were just, uh, few years older than you. - What were we? Thirteen? - Yeah. Thirteen. Uh, so Oak here spent the whole night memorizing every single one of our tracks. My favorite songs are "Bad", "Blue Silver", - and "Perfect". - Vaughn wrote all those. Yeah, and you love "Runaway" and "Tokyo", right? Yeah, I just think Vaughn's stuff is a little tighter, though, you know? Okay. Yeah. You are just like him. Yeah, you are just... Uh, you're very talented. Thanks. That him? Yeah. You really do remind me of him. A lot. But I'm better looking than that, right? Come on. Let's go practice some more. Ah! What do you say we do "Tokyo"? No. I'm good. Okay. Well, you pick. Let's go. Okay. Uh... "Blue Silver". Do you believe in reincarnation? All my brother and I did was play baseball with my father growing up. Two weeks into my senior year, he died. It was the year we competed at the State Championships. The day before the big game, this fat corgi mutt, he comes wandering into our backyard. Now we bring the dog in, feed him. The next morning, this jolly beer-scented dog comes to the game... and watched the whole thing. Sat above the dugout, next to my mom. Now, logically, I know that it's impossible that this fat corgi is the reincarnation of my dad. But anything's possible. You know why I wanted that guitar so bad? Hmm? It's worth about three grand. Yeah. Yeah. Looks pretty bad. Come work for me. I can't pay a lot but... it'll be enough to keep you out of trouble. I love you, D.B. Thank you. Okay. And you're gonna be okay working with Pedro? - Why wouldn't I be? - Don't bullshit me! There is nothing there anymore. I mean, beside, Pedro wanted kids. I'm sure he got a little left in the tank for you. No, I have a kid.

So... - We do? - We do. What the hell are you thinking? Oh, you're just mad you didn't think of it first. No. No, I'm mad because you're giving them false hope. There's no reunion. Mom and dad already fighting. Have a little imagination. I can't believe you don't see it. Tell me, what kind of marketing stunt - are you trying to pull? - It's not a marketing stunt. You know what, just shut up, get out there, and play. Where did Gina dig this guy up from, huh? She find him in a tribute band or something? - We have a tribute band? - Well, if we don't, we should. He's definitely not from a tribute band. Well, at least, please tell me he's different from Vaughn. Otherwise we'll seem pathetic. Hey, you guys. All right.

I listened to "Blue Silver" for the first time on Tuesday night. Uh, I thought you say you listen to us all the time. - All the time since Tuesday. - Okay. Oh, my God, you guys, that was incredible. Don't get your feelings hurt, kid. The dog hates everyone. Aww, he's so cute. - Well, he hates you. - Animals like me. Emma says it's 'cause I don't shower much. - You've got to be kidding me. - Aw.

I mean, got a lot on, so I'll probably fit you in my schedule. You know, my job really sucks and I really wanna play. I can't. - Oh, come on, come on. Look, tell me... - Nope. Nope. ...that this kid wouldn't love to be a front man, huh? All right. He... he doesn't have to be a 100 percent ready, but you will be the leader. Okay? You'd be taking on all the guitar licks that he can't handle yet, or vocals, and lead guitar. I'd be like a co-lead? We can't do this without you.

Um, I've seen them before. It's a metronome. All right? It's gonna be your... your best friend, and your worst enemy. - Okay. - So we're gonna take it very slow, keep a really slow beat, but you're gonna learn every lick from every Army of Love song ever. But at half speed. It's gonna be annoying but I promise it'll make you a better guitar player. - Now, put your guitar away. - Wait. how am I supposed to learn how to play guitar - without a guitar? - Uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh. No questions, okay? Do you trust me? - Not really. - Let's just focus. - Put it away. - Okay. Most guitar players out there, they're lazy, they're selfish. They don't wanna put in the work.

Well, we need more practice for sure. It's just every time we start practicing with Oak and his mom calls and he needs to be home ASAP. - So... - Okay. Well, we can fix that. Hey, I am... I really am seeing things more clearly now. Much more clearly. Mm! Ooh! Oh. That's not a good sign. - Wha... what? What's not a good sign? - Ah.

It's like a panda. You drew that? Yeah, I don't know why I always draw that. Right here? Yeah. This, too? Yeah. You really miss him, don't you? Every day. How much are you guys gonna pay him? Well, if this works, then I want Oak to get his fair share. I don't know what that means, so, um... Mom, they already gave me a 3,000 dollar guitar and free lessons. Sweetie, and that was really nice of them, but they need to pay you real money. Whatever Pedro makes, that's what Oak makes. We're not really making any money right now, so it... Oh, when you do. Deal. You have yourself a deal, Gina Jackson. Great. Same contract as a ten-year-old kid. - Oak. - Hey, Emma. Woo. Yeah. Woo. Yeah! Um, I haven't seen you lately. I've been practicing nonstop. Gina says I've got that star thing that Vaughn had. You know that Gina lady used to have problems. My dad said after her brother died, she went crazy. What happened? Had to go to a mental institution and everything. Why?

Oh, man. Those nights never ended well. Speak for yourself. That's where I learned my best drunken Spanish. Yeah. So, what do I owe this honor? Well... Hey, Army of Love tonight. Next big thing, you're gonna wanna be there. Hey, what's up, ladies? Army of Love tonight. I'll see... Okay. All right. That's all right. Free show tonight, Army of Love. Mom. Mom. Honey, what are you doing here? I thought you were at rehearsal? I can't find my guitar anywhere. Have you seen it? No. Um... No, have... have you checked your school? Maybe you left it at school. The show is tonight. What am I gonna do? Well, I... I think that you are gonna find it before the show and... and everything is gonna be fine. Your show is gonna be... Oh, my bus is coming. I... You will find your guitar. You're gonna have it for tonight, okay? I just have this feeling. I'll be there tonight, I promise. It's at eight o'clock. You're coming, right? I would never miss your show. I'm gonna be there. But I have to go. I love you, okay? Bye, baby. Come on. Love you, Mom. Here you go. Jean Jacket okayed this? Not yet. Why? I mean it's a little Pedro-centric, no? - Hey, showtime. You guys ready? - Jean! You seem rather chipper this morning. Well, that's 'cause I've got something super cool to show you guys. Come check this out. What you got? Are you guys ready to have your minds blown? All right. So this... this is Vaughn's old music journal. He doodled more than he wrote. Yeah. Well, check this out. I don't get it. This is not Vaughn's doodle. This is Oak's. And he's got plenty more just like this. You know, just like Vaughn's, look. - You see? - Okay. It's similar, I guess. I knew it. I knew it the moment that I saw him. I didn't wanna say anything until I had proof. - And now there's proof. - Proof of what? That Oak is the reincarnation of Vaughn. Ooh. - You're messing with us, right? - She's dead serious, I'm afraid. You guys, it's obvious. I mean, he plays like Vaughn. He talks like Vaughn. He's absorbed Army's music like it was already inhabiting his soul. I mean... What about Larry, right? Larry hates everyone but not Oak. Come on, he scooters, he surfs. - And now this. - Every kid in San Diego scooters and surfs. I mean, throw a frisbee down on Newport and you will hit one. Yeah, this is a sketch of the Chim Chim from Speed Racer. Vaughn loved that stupid show. All right. But how would a ten-year-old know that show? Uh, YouTube? I don't know. Uh... I don't care how he got this image in his head, it's just a picture. It's not proof of anything. I mean, he does have Vaughn's talent. But reincarnation, I mean, that... that... it's a bit out there, innit? Over half the world believes in reincarnation, - including D.B. Tell them. - No, don't... No, don't put this on me. Look, I told you a personal story about my father. You took it the wrong way. God, you guys won't even acknowledge this? Hey, look, the first time you saw Oak, he was playing Vaughn's old Taylor, singing his song. I'm sure that must've been traumatic. No. Oak is the reincarnation of Vaughn and this is our fate. Dammit, Gina. Uh, you know what? I knew something was wrong when you started getting all manic. Oh, manic? Come here. Are you taking any pills? No. And screw you for asking me. Is this why you have us practice until our fingers bleed, for your sad delusions? You know, I've been losing shifts for this. I'm losing money. You still remember what a coincidence is, right? Yeah, I do. Like the coincidence that D.B. gave away Vaughn's guitar? His 3,000 dollar guitar in the exact day that I needed 3,000 dollars? Oh, like, the coincidence that both, Oak, and Vaughn point with their devil horns? I mean, come on. Or like the coincidence of when you're vacationing in Jamaica and you make out with the most gorgeous bird in the entire resort only to find out that she's your second cousin. - Oh, all right. Enough. - Shut up. - All right, you guys. - I think I... I can speak for all of us when I say that we are worried about your state of mind. - Thank you for that. - And, how about Oak? You ever thought about what this might actually do to him? Are you kidding me? That's all I think about. You saw what a disaster his mom is. He needs me. He needs us. What about me? Oak, mate. Um... What's wrong? I can't find my guitar. I looked everywhere. - I'm so sorry. - No, it's okay. I'll help you find it, okay? Okay. Come here. If that kid really is Vaughn, looks like he gonna get in the way of y'all's relationship all over again. Uh-hmm. - Sh... shut up. It was right there, I know it was. It's okay. And you looked all around? - Yup. Yeah. - Okay. Hey, Oak? Is this your father? Yeah. He died before I was born. I know that's hard. Vaughn and I lost both of our parents when we were really young. And then after that, it was... ...foster family after foster family. I remember our worst foster father. Whenever Vaughn would sing or play his drum kit, he'd always say in this smoky cigar voice, you know, "Little kids are meant to be seen, not heard." He was awful. We ran away after two months. But you got to meet your real dad. I mean, before you got the awful dads. Yeah. I never got to meet mine. It's not here. I told you. Okay. Hey. I will find you another guitar for tonight, okay? And then after, I'll help you track down the Taylor. It's what managers do. Kinda like a mom, huh? Yeah. A lot like a mom. You think I'm Vaughn. That's what you were talking about with the band. If it turns out... I'm just Oak... can I still be in the band? Are you kidding me? Hey. Look, no matter what, you were meant to be a part of this family. I promise. Okay? But, uh, you got anything else to wear for the stage tonight? I got some clean gym shorts, and a dope yellow turtleneck. Oh, a dope yellow turtleneck. You wanna see it? This mom is gonna take you shopping. Next. Remove the hat, please? Oh, yes. What was the purpose of your trip? Um, lunch. I was visiting a friend. You buy anything while you were in Mexico? No. Can I ask to see your purse, please? Uh, yeah. What's this? Uh... These are kind of expensive. Oh, don't worry about that. I bet you have a birthday coming up, am I right? In like four months. - Oh. - You thought I have the same birthday as Vaughn? No. Actually, I thought maybe your birth happened around the same time he passed. Oh. Can I have the clothes anyway? Of course you can, silly. Let's check these out. Let's see what we got. Oh. Hendrix. You know who Jimi Hendrix is? He was left handed, self-taught, and died too young. Yeah, that's good. Oh, okay. You... you're gonna... - you're gonna try it on right now? - Too big? It's perfect. Hello, San Diego, my name is Sheila Sundgard, and it's an honor to be a part of this local music. We got a great lineup tonight. This next song is "Spoke Too Loud". ♪ Cool to talk But I like to shout and yell ♪ Where is she? Pedro, chill. She'll make it. - Relax, man. - Hey, you guys. You ready?

I know that this has been a strange journey for us, but let's embrace the crazy, honor the rebirth of Army of Love, and have a great damn show. - Amen. - Amen. Amen. Dude, what are you doing here?

I'm gonna bring them up soon, but just for now, can you do something for me? I just want you guys to close your eyes for a second. It's been awhile, so I want you to imagine that Vaughn Jackson is here singing to you guys. Now, I want you to transform him in your mind. What if Vaughn had a son? Uh. Just spiritually. A... a spiritual son. What would the next generation of Vaughn look like? Because that's who we've got here tonight. So, give it up for Army of Love and the Mighty Oak Scoggins. Yay! Army of Love!

You know, I'm still figuring it out, I'm just piecing it together. I thought that you've finally accepted his death, but I guess... I guess I was wrong 'cause it's... it's all just happening again. - No, it's different this time. - It's different? Just like the time that you, uh, claimed that you saw Vaughn's ghost. Remember that? Let me tell you something. I'm not doing this again. Okay? Oh, let me guess, it's different like that one time I had to call a 5150 hold on you, right?

All right. Well, Taylor loved the show and the video is already at 40,000 views, last I checked. I mean, it's working. It's called marketing. No. You see? This is what I'm talking about.

She never went to church, she never listened to us. She straightened out a little bit after the navy, I mean, she was a good woman. Well, even so, after her illness, she wasn't capable of taking care of herself. Illness? She had lupus. Yeah. She didn't want anyone to know, especially Oak. Yeah. Her trouble started right after the accident. Broke her back when she was only five months pregnant with Oak. - It was all Randall's fault. - Randall? - Oak's father. - Yeah, a total degenerate. Stinking drunk on the night of the car accident, wound up driving the wrong way on the freeway, and the good thing is that Randall died that night. - Good riddance! - Oh, Frank. I don't care. Was it... was it January 18th, the accident? Oh, it was in January, but it could've been the 18th. Where was the accident? - Long Beach, somewhere. - No, no, it was in Los Angeles.

No, it's okay. - It's okay. - I need to let him go. Set him free, you know, it's what's best. I'm proud of you. By the way... the drunk driver that killed Vaughn... that was Oak's father.
