PSYCHIATRIC HOSPITAL Mom. Mom! So? So... nothing. Well, good night. I'm going to bed. And to think, you made us dream. You're useless as thieves. What idiots! We're jinxed. Just like before. Clowns! You were hamming it up all this time. At the most, we could have taken 50,000 liras. But it was so beautiful, eh brother? It was full of women's wigs, pretty, blonde, smooth, and such fine, fine hair. And pretty costumes with golden belts. Rifles, guns... And a large painting. One part of it had rain... And the other part, a huge sun. And in the center a black devil, flying like a bat... carrying a naked, blonde woman on its back. And what did you do? This? Rabino! Bandera! Run! Come here! There's a dead woman! Come here! Let's go, run! There she is. She's young. And she has nice thighs. True. She has very nice thighs. Who? The dead girl. I don't see any dead girl. She's sleeping. He's right. I also see nothing. Idiot! You almost gave us a heart attack. You made us walk all the way over here for nothing... But what, are you seeing things? Come on, let's go. If those idiot cops come, they'll dick us over. She opened her eyes! Hey! She's not dead! What happened to you? Did something bad happen? She's cold. She needs coffee, something warm. We'll take her to your place. - Lift her. - Come on, come on. Poor thing. It breaks my heart. It's so cold. Make yourself comfortable. Don't worry. I'm a bit of a doctor, I'll cure you. No, no fever. Eh, Bandera, get us a coffee. Such nice hair. She's overheated. Let's get her undressed. Poor thing! She's lucky we found her. She's got a pair of...! Dear god, how beautiful they are! No, I'm not playing. You know who you look like? Who? The Jack of Spades. Why not you? Eh, what's up? We're thinking of you, nitwit. I see how it is. Nice wine, huh? So long, guys. The soldier who retreats lives to fight again. Hey drunkards, if you need a guide, I can go back up there one more time! Get the hell out of here! Son of a bitch! Should we ring? Either we ring, or we enter by force. Isn't this our house? Open Sesame! I'll huff, and I'll puff... Don't open it! We'll go in through the window. Come on. Come on. For me! You go in. Go fuck yourself... You go in! Go on! What's your name? Monica the Stiff. Are you naked? Yes. Like I told you? You know what they say. Two's company, but three's a crowd. Now we have a carpet at the foot of the bed. Are you comfortable, dearest? Would you like something to read? You don't snore, do you? If you do... What'll we do? Put our socks in her mouth. Time to sleep. Good night. Good night, ma'am. Yes, pleasant thoughts. Come on, hurry up. She's happy this morning. Sing, sing, louder. Eat and drink... And to think, we almost called a doctor, all because of a cold. It must have been the Sirocco wind affecting her.. My dear sister, how beautiful you are! Stuff it! Have you done your military service? How can I be a soldier, with a face like this? Here, something for the eyes. Right above the lashes there. You stink of wine. Better to stink of wine than of holy water. This fool was in the military. He was there three days. Do you know why they let him go? I'm going to tell her, Bandera. Go ahead. Yes, he was there, in the barracks. One fine day, while in the refectory, with all these fools who were there to serve their country, captains, graduates... ...I think there was even a general... suddenly, my mother entered, totally unclothed. What do you mean, unclothed? I mean totally naked. She had disrobed in the bathroom, among all the soldiers. How embarrassing... They spat in your eye, eh? You're lucky they didn't shit on you. Wait, don't move. I have to say something. Who is Rabino? Is it me? Or you? It's you. Yes. I'm sorry to tell you, but that's how it is. How were you when I was 10 years old? And when I was born? And when I die? Will you always be like this? Bandera, eh, Bandera. Do you remember the day I found the ewe? Poor Rosina. What a sad end she came to. How we cried. How we cried... when they killed our poor ewe. Who knows why everyone always sees The Virgin, but St. Joseph never appears for anybody. One guy saw The Virgin here, another saw her there... I'll bet that if anyone claims to see St. Joseph, they'll get beaten. Those cowards... Father, Son, Holy Ghost. "If my grandfather had built a castle," "they would call me 'castellano'..." People think there's something to gain from this world, but it's empty. I am the hero, not you. And nobody can teach nothing to nobody. Do you know who deflowered me? - Bye, father - Bye. I'll be back soon. Idiots, you come and eat, too! Father! Help! Father! Help! Let me go! Help! Let me go! Let me go! Wretch, get out of here! Get out of here! Leave! Leave! You're hurting me! Let go! Let go! You wretch! You wretch! He did nothing to me. He didn't touch me, father. He didn't touch me. Let's go, father. Don't cry like that. And do you know how we killed our father? Rosina, we must tie you up. What else can we do? I'll put a blanket on you, Rosina. I have it here, do you see? We have to get out of here. How are you, Rosina? You're hot, eh? We're going to ask for alms. The people will be leaving church now. Don't you hear the bell? You can make a lot of money asking for alms. The people are good. They give us money. We'll bring you salt, don't worry. - Take it. - She likes me more. - Who do you like more, Rosina? - Me, right? Let's go, it's late. Bye, Rosina. We'll see you this afternoon. Eh, do you see how these babies cry? - We're eating Rosina! - She's delicious. Come and eat, there's a piece left for each of you! Go on, eat it! Your parents have made peace, don't you see? Why do you cry over a ewe? "Now we'll sing the story of Rosina," "who had the luck to be born into this world, and the misfortune to leave it in an oven..." "And when nobody else saw it, they said it went to heaven," "but no one knows for sure, because she didn't know how to fly..." Let's go, kids. Here, each of you smoke half a "National." Rabino, Bandera, why do you cry... You didn't do anything. She was as tough as the sole of my shoe. It's all stuck in here. It won't come up and it won't go down. To Jesus of Nazareth, first martyr of Socialism: "Great is the iniquity of the world" "Great is the hypocrisy of popes," "the sect of the Eternal, with its Paradise, Purgatory and Hell," "tamed Protestant kings and consumed entire towns," "tyrannized souls for 18 centuries, after which it fell" "bathed in blood but without the clatter of swords." "Man flees from the heavens towards fertile fields," "towards insurmountable peaks and stormy seas," "he runs searching, until the final plague." "Now as the old gods approach their goals, come back, Jesus," "the common person salutes you, great martyr of humanity," "burned by Kings, overcome but not tamed." "There are no gods left: from the ruined cloisters," "from the obscene churches, arise, Jesus." "You, you will be the man of thought," "You will be with Hobbes, Kant, Hus and Voltaire." "Not with the lying priests, not with the scribes," "they belong to the new centuries, they have made you a God of Gold," "we will make you a Man of Labor, Jesus." Go stick it up your ass. Down with the charlatans of Montecitorio! Neither Gods nor masters! Long live the social revolution! Down with the government! Long live the army of the revolution! Down with the bayonets! I was right... "Our country is the whole world," "our law is liberty," "and a thought... dear to our hearts." "Oh, fugitives from Italy," "to adventure..." To peace... To all who care about peace. But look what an idea one of my kids had... Jesús... Shut up, you drunk, you want to wake up the kids? Eh, my handsome ones, we're gonna sing a song! Come on, let's go! Who are you? Martyrs of death. And what will you do when you grow older? We will kill kings. And if their guards come? We'll kill them as well. "Stop and raise your brows," "you who are oppressed by work." "Atop the mount..." "The sun of the future is already shining," "already shining." "To the magnificent heroes of gold," "to the shepherds of any flock," "in the temple or the palace," "that star is waning." "Peace to the poor squatters!" "War on the palaces and churches!" "Don't let the loathsome bourgeois escape," "from hunger and poverty." "The rich have robbed us..." "Of the sweat of our forebears." "They have violated our sisters," "and stolen all our happiness," "and stolen all our happiness." "But a single shout: Death to the thieves!," "sounds from the fields to the offices." "No more to plundering," "no more to the insult of servitude." "Peace to the poor squatters!" "War on the palaces and churches!" "Don't let the loathsome bourgeois escape," "from hunger and poverty." "Peace to the poor squatters!!" "War on the palaces and churches!" "Oh, Justice, our great hope," "your kingdom approaches!" "For centuries beaten-down humanity," "has been moaning for you." "But just one cry: Death to the thieves!," "sounds from the fields to the offices." "No more plunder..." Ours! The world is ours! I still remember. He was like this. Poor thing. He was a real man. He truly believed in freedom. From him we learned everything. But what the hell have we learned? It's such a sunny day. Let's go to the beach at Ostia. Look what I found. Crap, how lucky you are. See how beautiful it is? Throw that filthy thing away. The sea makes me want to make love. What do they want? What are they saying? The Mistress of Desire... I'm going in. You're not coming? We're not coming. Why not? We don't want to see the asses of the fish. Is she naked? How should I know? Rabino, Bandera, Come on in! It's warm, I swear to you! Come on! - Do I look like a siren? - Yes, as in alarm. Come on, you get in too! I'm cold. Bandera... come on, let's make a fire. - María! - She's on the street! Under the steps! Rabino and Bandera. "Dear Bandera and Rabino:" "it's already been 4 months." "See how quickly time has passed?" She's got a lot of nerve! "In one week it'll be Holy Week." "Everything's in order at home." "I'm here waiting for you. Many, many kisses..." "From your inseparable monkey." Let's write an answer immediately! Eh, how do we begin? "Dear..." "Dear monkey:" "we've received your much-anticipated letter," And then? But wait! There's still a lot of letter left! Shit! "...we've received your much-anticipated letter..." Period. "Enclosed within these four walls..." "Time does not pass." You've got the wrong idea about prison. We'd like to see you here... "Enclosed within these four walls... it's not fit for a dog" Not fit for a dog? Why not? Isn't it the truth? "Anyway, things are as they are." "Don't worry about us, we always remember you." That's enough. And the "Sincerely"? Sincerely, Bandera and Rabino". "Bandera and Rabino"... Let me see it. Pathetic! We should just tear it up. But what will we send her? - Did you confess? - No, no. - And you, did you confess? - Open it. - Did you confess? - I'm not a snitch... Did you confess? No, it's not fashionable anymore. Did you confess? Go ahead, open it for us. In the name of the Father, the Son and the Holy Ghost, Amen. - Praised be Jesus. - Praised be. How long has it been since your last confession? Since the last time I was in prison. What sins have you committed in this time? Oh, I'm full of sins. - Tell me, my son. - Well... I've stolen... That's a given. Continue. I've committed some of those... What do you call them? Eh... Impure acts. But not much, right? Just a couple of times. - And with women? - Never. Really, never? Never. And with men? What are you saying, Father? What do you take me for? Are you joking? Other sins? Other sins... Well... A lie, but a real small one, no malicious intent. I've fought. I've hit somebody. They hit me in the nose. I know it was my fault, but unfortunately... Well... I don't think there are any others. Just these. For your sins say two Ave Marías and two Our Fathers. Thank you. - Act of Contrition. - "Dear God, I repent heartily..." "Of my sins and of having offended your infinite majesty..." Good day, Father. Do you remember me? How could I remember you? There are so many of you... Fair enough, fair enough. In the name of the Father, the Son and the Holy Ghost. Praised be Jesus. - Praise him. - How long since your last confession? - Since the last time I was in prison. - What sins have you committed? Me? What sins could I have committed? The one who sinned was my mother, who brought me into this world. Have you stolen? Have you cursed? Have you committed impure acts? The one who robs is not the sinner, but rather the one who obliges him to rob. Same goes for the one who obliges him to curse. In any case, yes, I've robbed and I've cursed... But how is it possible you don't remember me? I'm the brother of the guy who just left! The two anarchist brothers! "When the sun of the future..." Fine, fine... let's continue. Have you committed carnal sins? Have you lied? Totally, Father. I've sinned a lot. My brother and I have been to see whores... Once I took him, and another time he took me. These women were there! What are we supposed to do? But we're not the kind to fall in love with such types! We get it done like real men. Once, and then we leave. Fine, fine. Continue. Tell me one thing, Father. The Devil, does he still exist? Certainly. And in what form does he present himself? In any form that tempts. For your sins say two Our Fathers and two Ave Marias. - Yes, yes. - Act of Contrition. "Dear God, I heartily repent..." "My sins and of having offended your infinite majesty..." The body of our lord Jesus Christ... Corpus Christi... Corpus Christi... Italy has lost a hero! Freedom, you make me sick! I want to die! Bandera, do you remember the time we kissed each other? What? Yes, once, like two lovers in a trench. What are you saying? Are you stupid? Stupid? Is it possible you don't remember? It was at Acqua Santa, where we went swimming. And? That day when we saw that old guy doing that fat woman... And we looked... We hid ourselves in a ditch. There among the mushrooms, behind a shrub... Go screw yourself... How can you not remember? The ditch was tiny. We were squeezed in real close... how can you forget? They left and we stayed behind Let me sleep! There, we kissed. And we also played dirty... as if we were lovers. Damn! What strange things, eh? Do you remember someone else who was always there in Acqua Santa? He came every day at 5, and they called him "the professor." He'd come when all us kids were swimming, and he'd read everybody's palms. Don't you remember? That's right. And? And do you remember what he'd say to us when he read our palms? That's right! That we would never die on land, on sea, or in the air... I'd like to go back to being a kid, y'know. Those were the days... Cell 666, visitor! Rabino and Bandera, you have a visitor! Bye bye! How did they let you in? I went to a judge and got a certificate of cohabitation Cohabitation! With whom? With one of you... With you. With him? You want to live with him? With this fool? Why do you laugh? You have to choose, you can't be with both. You say it, Bandera, did I make a mistake? You did very well! Wow, she really is a devil, this little monkey! And how did you get here? Your friends... - Which ones? Aria, Baffo and Fiorino? - Yes, they're so adorable. - Yeah, they have such big hearts... - Then that means they're downstairs! Yes. They're waiting for me. - Fiorino! - Baffo! Aria! There they are... Let's get out, they're at the window! - Hey, you jailbirds! - Aria! Hey! How's life in prison? You guys'll land here soon enough... We're saving you a place! Yeah, you'll get here... You look like a couple of finches! Wait, wait... Look, music! They're playing music for us! - Shit! - For you!! This is for Rome... and this is for your sister! Let's go! Let's go, you only have 5 more minutes. Come on! Bye! Be well. Bye, Fiorino! Say hi to everybody! - Bye! - Kisses! Give my regards to freedom... Bye! You've wasted half an hour in prison yourself, see? - Bye. - Bye, Bandera. Bye, Rabino. We'll see each other soon. Now I know how to get here. And don't worry about your house. You'll be so surprised! I've made it so nice you won't be able to recognize it. - Bye. - Bye. Bye, sister-in-law! So many times we've been in prison, this is the first visit we've ever had. Wonderful. - Mr. Bandera! - What do you want? I wish the time would pass faster... You worried your wife will still be single? You mean 'fiancee, ' of course! You'll grow old, multiply, be happy... You'll have kids. Yes... Two! Yes, two handsome boys. Two little boys who will reserve for you... the same fate we gave to our own father. You're joking? Isn't it obvious I'm joking? Why so serious all of a sudden? It could have been you. But instead, she and I will be living together. How ready you are! You like that, eh? What are you looking for? For María de la Roma... Let me get this straight... What's your game here? You weren't being serious? No. It was a joke. Outside! Outside! Then where will I go? Where will I sleep? It'll be you and your wife. You know what I dreamt last night? They told us we had a visitor, and instead of her... it was Rosina, the ewe. I wonder what she's doing now? She'll be cleaning, drawing water... She'll even have put curtains in the windows... Poor thing. Poor thing? You know what they call girls like her? Whores! Everybody's done her! Aria, Baffo, Fiorino... Half of Rome. Everybody's done it to her! Only you and I were incapable of doing anything! We're even, incapable of even... Stop! Remember that. We couldn't do it! And you called her a "poor thing"... You make me sick! Rabino, stop. You defend her? And you call yourself my brother... You make me sick! Let's stop this, come on! "Poor thing"... You make me sick! If I have to tell you again I'll bite your tongue off! Then show me who you are! - Did you confess? - And get 30 more years? - You, did you confess? - Open! You, did you confess? We're free in a week! What do we have to confess? You got the wrong cell, chief! In a week we'll be out and we'll commit many more sins. When we come back to prison, we'll confess then. We don't have any sins right now. - You, did you confess? - We're innocent, chief! Where is she? Hey, what am I, invisible? You suddenly too good for us? No, that's not what I meant... Forget it... Just joking. We've got a surprise. Some friends! We've been here 3 hours. The least you could give us is a kiss! Get out of here... Christ, how disgusting! You stink of prison! - Come on, let's go. - Wait! Here, this is for you. Alright, we're done here, right? We'll take it from here. Thanks, for now. Bye. Don't go that way! Remember what the old guy said? "The wave of desire"... I'm going in. You're not going! That will require getting undressed. - Here we go again... - This time you're coming with me. Here no one will see us. Come on! Let's go! The water's great! Come on! Even if the sea was made of wine, I wouldn't go in. Bandera, set a good example. Come on. Bathing in the sea bothers me, I prefer bathing in prison. Go on, make her happy. Wow. It's salty! Bandera, it was probably a good idea to go in the water, it'll help take the stink of prison off us... Crap... the money! This is all we have left! It's as warm as piss! Crap, the thousand liras! The thousand liras! "They were like lions in the jungle..." Eh, Bandera, what's there to worry about? We're free! If we want, we can swim as far as we want! - As far as the sun! - Let's go! Come on! Leave her, let's go... It's almost night. Let's go. "They were like lions in the jungle..." "One said to the other: traitor," "when the lieutenant was hit in the head," "by a young man in the flower of his youth." "Oh, sad destiny..." "That has punished me," "with all these crimes..." "I will die." Lift me! One, two... Damn, you're heavy! And three! Jesus, the things we have to do! Come on! I'm freezing! Let's make a fire, like the other time. Come on! And the matches? I have them. Here. We need more wood. I'll kill you! Whore! You bitch! I'll strangle you... Bandera! Bandera! Bandera! Eh, Bandera! English subtitles by BFE2
