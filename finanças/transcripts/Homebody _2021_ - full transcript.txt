(light music) - [Johnny Voiceover] I had a dream about you. Melanie, my babysitter and my best friend. (light music continues) In the dream I was your baby. And it was just you and me. (baby cries) Together forever. (light music continues) (Johnny singing) (light music) (knocking) - [Claire] Johnny? - Come in! - Honey, I just talked to Melanie. - Is she here? - Not yet, she just called to say she has to leave early today. - Why? - Well one of her clients is having a baby so she needs to go help them. But I can come home from work and then you and me can have a day together, okay? - Okay. (door thuds) (traffic humming) (birds chirping) - Listen, you're gonna come outta this thing a whole new person. Yes, rebirth! (laughs) Yes. Yeah, I know it's loud, his mom wanted me to take him to the park. Hold on, you're not filming me again, are you? - [Johnny] No. - Yeah, we've been doing this whole thing where we record a video and then like mouth along to the words. Yeah, yeah, like a lip sync. Anyway, um, cool. Well, um, I'm gonna be with him until six. That's usually when his mom comes home. So, uh, I can be in the city around eight and we can get some dinner and then get trashed. (Melanie laughs) (doorbell dings) (light music) - Hi, Melanie. - Hi. - Um, so- - It's just hard to say how long it will be before they need me, I'm sorry. - [Claire] No, no, no. It's the first time it's happened. They just keep texting you? - [Melanie] Yeah, every half hour. It's her first baby, so- - Right. - [Melanie] She's nervous. - [Claire] Oh, um, hold on, I just need to get this. (phone ringing) - Sure. (light music) - [Claire] Hi, this is Claire. - [Johnny] Melanie, I feel good when I'm with you. Outside there are things that feel bad. Like kids who laugh at you or say you look like a girl. Like that's a bad thing. But when we're home it's just me and you. - [Claire] He's really gonna miss you. - [Melanie] I know, it's a bummer. - [Claire] I mean, I'm gonna miss you too, but this is a big moment for you. - [Melanie] Yeah, totally. - [Claire] So, uh, will you just be working with the same midwife now or...? - [Melanie] Well, I actually just joined this natural birth collective. - Oh, cool. - So I'll give you a call if they need me, but... - All right. - I mean, who knows. - Bye, Johnny. - Bye, Mom! - [Claire] And remember our deal, some time outside today. - [Johnny] I know! - Okay, I'll see you later. - Bye. - And...smile. (camera clicks) (light music) (box rustling) - Okay, you ready? (Johnny hums) Pump it up. (upbeat music) (Melanie cheers) - [Johnny] What is it? - It's a video. - Let me see. - [Melanie] Uh, looks freaky. - [Johnny] I'm freaky. (light music) - [Man] Free-spirit meditation, an introduction. Part one, what is free spirit meditation? We are not individuals because we are each of us, divisible. We are body and spirit. Free-spirit meditation allows the spirit to break free from the limitations of physical form and to seek experiences that the body cannot provide. Freedom, adventure, escape. Part two, how can I do free-spirit meditation? Find a comfortable position, close your eyes, slow your breath. (Melanie chuckles) Visualize a light and simply let go. Let your spirit leave your body and go to the light. (phone ringing) (Melanie hums) - Hi, Sharon. - Hey, Melanie. - Hi. - [Melanie] Hi, Priya, how are you feeling? - I'm okay, I'm okay. I really didn't sleep at all last night. - [Melanie] Yeah? How far apart are the contractions? (Priya sighs) - Maybe um- - 15, 16 minutes. - Okay, good. All right, I'm gonna call Johnny's mom, and when she gets home I can leave and I'll go home and shower and then I'll come over- - Can I come? - In a little while. - Yeah, that sounds good. - Can I come too? - Johnny, we're talking, okay? - But I can help. - [Priya] Oh, and my legs have been cramping up. - Um, yeah. - It kinda hurts. - Oh, I'm sorry. - I was just saying to Priya I wish I could go into her body and do the hard part for her. - Uh, yeah. - Right? Well, until I get there, lie down and rest, maybe go outside for a walk if you can. (traffic humming) (birds chirping) (leaves rustling) - Maybe, uh... - [Melanie] Sorry this is such bad timing, I know you probably just got to work. - [Claire] All right, I'm just looking at one thing here. You know what, I actually think I can get back to the house in an hour and a half. Is that gonna work? - [Melanie] Yeah, that should be fine. - [Claire] Oh, have you guys gone outside at all? He promised me that he would spend just a little time in the park. - I know. - Good boy. (pages rustling) (light music) - [Johnny Voiceover] Close your eyes. Slow your breath. Visualize a light. Let go. (light music continues) (suspenseful music) (light music) Whoa. This is so weird. Wait. Whoa. (light music continues) - [Melanie] Johnny? (dramatic whooshing) Hello? Are you up there? (blanket rustling) Oh, hey, there you are. Want a smoothie? Mm-hm. - [Man] Free-spirit meditation allows you to send your spirit into other beings. Animals, plants, inanimate objects. You can even send your spirit into another person, leaving your body alive but catatonic. When you enter another human, your spirit takes over their conscious mind and the host's spirit sinks down into the subconscious. Now you can see through someone else's eyes, speak with their voice. You can make a home of a new body. It's an experience unlike any other. Are you ready? (water dripping) - [Johnny] Melanie? - [Melanie] Yeah? - Why do you like being a doula? - [Melanie] Um, why do you ask? - [Johnny] I don't know. - Well, I like being so close to birth and I like- - Well maybe you could be my babysitter and be a doula. Like do both. - I wish I could. But, you know, sometimes you gotta let go of who you were to become who you wanna be. Does that make sense? (Johnny chuckles) (Melanie chuckles) (light music) - [Johnny Voiceover] I wish I could be your smoothie, because then you'd digest me and I'd become a part of your body. And we'd always be together. (light music continues) (lighter clicks) (birds chirping) (pee trickling) (toilet flushing) (door clicks) - [Melanie] Johnny? (light music) (birds chirping) (suspenseful music) (light music) Hello? Is this hide and seek? - [Johnny Voiceover] Melanie, I'm right behind you. - Johnny? Let's go! (light music continues) (door thuds) Okay. Oh. (Melanie chuckles) I wonder where Johnny could be. (dramatic whooshing) (heartbeat thudding) (Melanie gasps) (light music) - [Johnny Voiceover] Oh wow. I'm Melanie. (Melanie gasps) That's my voice. (Melanie chuckles) (light music continues) (Melanie gasps) (light music continues) (Melanie sniffs) (light music continues) (suspenseful music) (Melanie gasps) (trash rattling) (piano dings) (light music) (soft breathing) (Melanie humming) (birds chirping) (phone ringing) (phone dings) (woman moaning) (baby cries) - Let go. (door clicks) - Hello? (frantic music) Anybody home? Hey. - Hi. - Where's Johnny? - Johnny, he's sleeping. - Oh, really? He never takes a nap. - [Melanie] Um, uh huh. - Are you okay? - Yes. - All right, I'm gonna go check on him upstairs. - No! I have to show you something. - [Claire] What? - It's a surprise. - Oh, okay. Uh, I'm gonna go to the bathroom first. (light dramatic music) (Melanie panting) (blanket rustling) He has a little crush on you, did you know that? I actually found a letter. I found it hidden in his drawer. Did he ever give it to you? Oh, I wish I could remember what it said. Oh, it was so cute. Um- - That was his private letter. - I guess it was. He never used to hide anything from me. It's silly, but I worry that he feels closer to you than he does to me. (light music) Anyway, uh, you had something that you wanted to show me? - Yes. (Melanie breathing heavily) Here, Johnny drew this. - Oh! - Yeah. - That's nice. - Yeah, it's nice. Yeah, he did the, he did the house, that's the head. And the house is the head and the windows are the eyes. - Oh, there's a little boy inside. - Yeah. - Well, you probably have to run. - Huh? - Your client. - Oh. - Oh, no, no, no. It's all good. I took the afternoon off, you go ahead. Johnny and I will spend the day together. - No, I don't have to go. - [Claire] Oh, I thought you said she was already in labor. - Not anymore. - Huh. - Yeah. So, um, you can, you can leave. - Oh. Well, uh... Yeah, I do have some errands that I can run. Oh, I would really love to go to the gym. - Uh huh. - Um, yeah, all right, great. - Great. - Yeah, thank you. (light music) - You're welcome. - [Claire] Hey, so you're sure it's all right for me to head out? - Yeah, I don't mind. - All right. Well, I really appreciate it. Oh, so uh, did Johnny get any park time today? - Uh, no. - Okay, because he and I made a deal just a little time outside. He really has to- - I know! Um, he told me. - Oh, he did? Good, okay. OK, here's my... (objects rattling) Well I will see you later tonight. - Yeah, okay, bye. Love y... - I love you too, Melanie. Bye. (light music) (box rustling) (light music continues) (light clicks) (light music) (Melanie sighs) (upbeat music) (Melanie shrieks) (Melanie shrieks) (Melanie laughs) (Melanie panting) (Melanie moaning) (light music) (Melanie hums) (pee trickling) (Melanie gasps) (phone dings) - [Melanie] Hi, um, why is there a piece of white cloth in my vagina? - [Siri] Okay, here's what I found. Tampon, noun, a plug of absorbent material used to soak up menstrual blood during a woman's period. - [Melanie] What is woman's period? (phone dings) (door clicks) - [Johnny Voiceover] The problem with me being in you is that we can't talk. But I can pretend. - Hi, Johnny. - [Johnny Voiceover] Melanie, wow. You just look so amazing. - I know. - [Johnny Voiceover] Maybe you should go outside. - I just wanna stay home with you. - [Johnny Voiceover] Come on, go show everybody how beautiful you are. What are you afraid of? Nobody's gonna laugh at you, I promise. Come on, you're Melanie. You're the smartest and coolest and the prettiest girl in the world. (light music) (traffic humming) (muffled talking) (upbeat music) (train clattering) (Melanie hums) (baby cries) (muffled talking) (light music) Melanie. Where are you? Somewhere far away? I wish we were together right now. (plane engine roaring) (phone ringing) (Melanie hums) - Um, hello? - Yeah, okay, good, good. Hey, Melanie. - Yes, this is me, Melanie. Who is this? - It's Sharon. So, Priya's water broke. - Let me talk to her. - What? - Let me talk to her. - [Sharon] Here, I'm gonna pass her the phone. - [Priya] Melanie, are you still babysitting? - Um, no, I left from there. - [Priya] Great, so you're on your way over here now, right? Sharon just finished filling the birth pool, but I don't know if I should get in now or... What do you think? - What do I think? (Priya groans) - [Sharon] Hey, it's me again. Priya's having a contraction. We'll see you soon, yeah? - Yeah, uh... - [Sharon] You're the best, Melanie. Thanks, bye. - Bye. (phone beeps) (birds chirping) (camera clicks) (light music) (kids laughing) - Come on! - [Johnny Voiceover] Were they...? Were they laughing at me? (engine rumbling) (engines roaring) (plane engine humming) (muffled talking) - Melanie? It's Sunita. From high school. Oh my god, come here. What's going on? - What do you mean? - [Sunita] Like, what are you up to these days? - Oh. I'm a babysitter. - Yeah? - For Johnny. He's probably my best friend. - That's cool. - [Melanie] Uh huh, it's cool. - I've been really busy with- - I got woman's period today. But it's okay because I had a period tampon. Do you have period today? - No. Wow, well, you look really great. - No, I don't. I have to go home and clean my face and stuff. - [Sunita] Oh, uh, where do you live? - Where do I live? - [Sunita] Like, your apartment? - My apartment? - Melanie? - I have to go now, goodbye. (light music) (egg crunches) (camera clicks) (phone keyboard clicking) (phone dings) (man whistles) (Melanie sighs) (light music) (light dramatic music) (train clattering) (metal screeching) (door squeaking) (light music) (bag rustling) (muffled talking) (light music continues) - [Johnny Voiceover] Melanie? Hello? - [Man] You can make a home of a new body. ...takes over and the host sinks down into the subconscious. Part four, exiting a host body. Once your spirit is in another body, exiting is simple. All you have to do is let go. Imagine your spirit is holding a mirror. In the reflection you see someone else's face. Let them go. Let the mirror f... Part five, what do I do if I'm stuck in an inanimate object? Part six, where should I keep my body while my spirit is... Part seven, how can I communicate with a human host spirit? While your spirit is in a host body, you can make contact with the host spirit by opening the subconscious. Take a deep breath, clear your mind. Think 'open subconscious' or 'close subconscious'. However, once you begin letting go, the ability to communicate shuts down as the free spirit detaches- - Open subconscious. - Can anyone hear me? - Open subconscious. - Hello? - Melanie? - [Melanie Voiceover] Oh, Johnny. What is going on? I can hear your voice but I can't really see anything. - [Johnny Voiceover] Oh, I think the video said you're in the subconscious. - Wait, wait, what video? - [Johnny Voiceover] The free-spirit one. I did what it said and my spirit floated into your body. - [Melanie Voiceover] What? - I know, right? It's crazy. - Whoa, whoa, whoa. I can hear my voice. Are you speaking in my voice? - [Johnny Voiceover] Oh, sorry. - [Melanie Voiceover] Oh, no, no, that's okay. So you meditated into... That's, wow. Are you some kind of... (phone ringing) Wait, is that my phone? - It says Sharon. - Oh my god. Um, yeah, answer it I guess. - Hi. - Hey. Priya keeps asking when you're getting here. I thought you were on your way? - Oh, my God. - Um. - [Melanie Voiceover] Uh, just say you'll come right over. - You'll come right over. - What? - I'll come right over. - I'll come right over. - [Sharon] Okay, hurry if you can. - [Melanie Voiceover] Oh my god, whoa. (knocking) Um. Is someone knocking on the door? - [Johnny Voiceover] Oh, I can go look. - Hey, cutie pie, you home? - [Melanie Voiceover] I hear Tom's voice. Wait, why is he at your house? - [Johnny Voiceover] I'm not at my house. Um, I'm at your apartment. - [Melanie Voiceover] How did y... Why are you at my apartment? - [Johnny Voiceover] Well, it's kind of like that you're at your apartment 'cause I'm you, remember? - [Melanie Voiceover] No, no, no. You're not me you're just- (Melanie sneezes) - Bless you. - Okay, you know what? Just tell him to leave. - [Johnny Voiceover] But I thought he was your boyfriend. - Shugs, you gonna let me it? - No, he's not my boyfriend. We just, um, sometimes- - Melanie. - [Melanie Voiceover] Yeah, I'm not gonna explain this to you. Wait, are you opening the door? Don't open the door. - Hi. - Hello. - I like that dress. - [Melanie Voiceover] Johnny, tell him to go away right now. - Go away. - You want me to go? (laughs) Okay. - [Melanie Voiceover] Is he gone? - Not yet. - Not yet. - You know what? Try not to answer me out loud. - [Johnny Voiceover] Right, sorry. - No. You have to go away. - Okay, I will. I just gotta go to the bathroom first if that's okay. - Um. - Wait, what's going on? - I gotta go bad. - [Melanie Voiceover] Whoa. Whoa, did you let him in? - [Johnny Voiceover] He's just going to the bathroom. (door thuds) - Oh, this is not good. How did this even...? Okay, I gotta figure out how... What, are you listening to him pee? - [Johnny Voiceover] What? No. - [Melanie Voiceover] Okay, okay. When he comes out of there, do not engage. Just get him to leave. - [Johnny Voiceover] Fine by me. - [Melanie Voiceover] Don't even look at him, okay? - [Johnny Voiceover] Sure, easy. - There's no music on. That's really unlike you. (upbeat music) - [Melanie Voiceover] What is he doing? - [Johnny Voiceover] I think he's dancing? - You like the way I move my body? - [Melanie Voiceover] Oh no. Okay, yeah, this has to stop. - Dance with me. - [Melanie Voiceover] No. No you will not. Go turn off the music. - Come on! There you go. (Tom chuckles) (upbeat music continues) There you go. - [Melanie Voiceover] Hey, turn off the music right now. - [Johnny Voiceover] I was just walking over there to do that. - Aren't you supposed to be looking after little Jimmy? - [Melanie] Johnny. - Johnny, right. - Don't talk to him! - He called me Jimmy. - [Tom] What was that? - [Melanie] I didn't say anything. - [Melanie Voiceover] Okay, I need you to stay in your head. - Okay. I'm gonna go get some water now. - [Melanie Voiceover] What? Wait. Why is he even here? Like how did that happen? - [Johnny Voiceover] Why don't you like him? - Johnny. - I think he's nice. - [Melanie Voiceover] Okay, listen to me. I need you to trust me that this can go very badly very quickly, so I need you to get him out of my apartment. - Okay, fine. - Um, Tom? - [Tom] I'm in here! In the bedroom. - [Melanie Voiceover] Oh. What? - [Johnny Voiceover] Um, Melanie? - [Melanie Voiceover] What is happening? - [Johnny Voiceover] He's on the bed and his pants are off. - [Melanie Voiceover] Oh no. - [Tom] Can we cuddle just for a minute? - Oh, my god! - Um, no because you have to go now. - [Tom] What's going on with you? You're not acting like yourself. - Okay, well, I am myself. - Are you breaking up with me? - [Melanie Voiceover] Breaking up with you? Were we even dating? - You don't gotta say anything. - [Johnny Voiceover] I think I hurt his feelings. - [Melanie Voiceover] Just let him go. (light music) Johnny? (loud thud) (Melanie gasps) What was that? - Oh no. - [Melanie Voiceover] Wanna tell me what's going on? - [Johnny Voiceover] He's, uh... He's hurt. - [Melanie Voiceover] What do you mean hurt? - [Johnny Voiceover] I think I killed him. - [Melanie Voiceover] What? - [Johnny Voiceover] I am so sorry. - [Melanie Voiceover] Call 911. Johnny? Go, go, go. - [Johnny Voiceover] I am! - [Melanie Voiceover] Oh, Tom. (phone beeping) (phone ringing) - [Dispatcher] 911, what's your emergency? - I killed somebody. - Alright. - Don't say that! - I mean- - [Melanie Voiceover] Just say someone is hurt and needs medical attention. - Someone...medical tension. - Okay. - Did you check to see if he's breathing? - What's your location, ma'am? - 165 Wisteria 4G. - 4D. - Okay, stay on the phone with me. - Did you check to see if he's breathing? - Um, no. - [Dispatcher] Yes, don't hang up. - I won't, I won't. - You have to. Go see if he's breathing. - Ma'am, I need you to stay on the line. - Just go check on him. - Okay, uh... (light music continues) Oh. - Hey. - Oh, thank god. - [Tom] Messed up your towel. - [Melanie] Oh. - Is that 911? Hi, I'm the guy she's talking about. No, I just, I um, I fell down- - [Melanie Voiceover] Okay, that was really f... Messed up, wow. Okay, all right, I gotta focus. You have to get out of my body. I have to get to the birth and- - [Johnny Voiceover] Close subconscious. - [Melanie Voiceover] What'd you say? - [Johnny Voiceover] Close subconscious. - [Melanie Voiceover] Johnny... - No, no, don't send an ambulance, I'm good, I'm good. Okay, I will. I'm gonna hang up now. (Tom sighs) (light music) I should probably go. (Tom sighs) (door squeaks) (door thuds) - [Johnny Voiceover] Open subconscious. - [Melanie Voiceover] Johnny, what just happened? - [Johnny Voiceover] I just thought I could- - [Melanie Voiceover] No, you know what? I don't have time for this. You have to get out of my body right now. - [Johnny Voiceover] Well, the video said to get out I have to let go. - [Melanie Voiceover] Okay, then, let go. - [Johnny Voiceover] What does that mean? - [Melanie Voiceover] How am I supposed to know? You are the one who did this. - [Johnny Voiceover] Well, I just, I don't know. - [Melanie Voiceover] Okay, all right. You get that this is my life, right? That this is my job? - I know. - [Melanie Voiceover] So why did you do this? - I don't know. - No, I don't believe that. Why did you do this? - [Johnny Voiceover] I said I don't know. - [Melanie Voiceover] Oh, okay, all right. So you just magically floated into my body for no reason? - [Johnny Voiceover] Well, yeah, well you are the one who's leaving me just like everybody else. - I'm not- - You're never even gonna see me again, so why do you care? - Okay. - I'm sorry. - [Melanie Voiceover] It's okay, just take a deep breath. - [Johnny Voiceover] I just, I just wanted to feel what it would be like to be you. - [Melanie Voiceover] (sighs) Okay, okay. But you can't be somebody else, you have to be you. - [Johnny Voiceover] What if I don't wanna be me? - [Melanie Voiceover] Well, you don't really know who you are yet. You get to choose who you wanna be. (phone ringing) (sighs) Oh, God. Do you really think there is nothing you can do to fix this right now? - [Johnny Voiceover] I don't... I don't know. - (sighs) Okay. I think we have to do this together. - [Johnny Voiceover] You mean... Wait, what do you mean? (light music) Melanie? - Yeah? - [Johnny Voiceover] I'm nervous. - [Melanie Voiceover] It's totally normal to be nervous, but I'm right here. - [Johnny Voiceover] I don't think I can do this. - [Melanie Voiceover] Look, you just have to do what I tell you, okay? Okay? - Yeah. (light music) (quiet knocking) - Was that you knocking? - Yes. - [Melanie Voiceover] Yeah, okay, they're not gonna hear that. You have to knock way louder than that. (loud knocking) Whoa, whoa, whoa. Way too loud. - [Johnny Voiceover] You said I should knock louder. - Melanie, finally. It took you forever. - [Johnny Voiceover] She's hugging me. - [Melanie Voiceover] Okay, well, hug her back. - [Sharon] Priya's upstairs. Oh, could you close the door? - Oh. - Her contractions have been getting really intense. I got your voicemail the last- - Is that Melanie? - Yeah. Okay, come on. (Priya groaning) She's in here. Hey. - (sighs) Hey, Melanie. - [Melanie Voiceover] Say "Hi, Priya." - Hi, Priya. - You need anything? (Priya exhaling) - Mm-mm. - Are you standing next to her? - [Johnny Voiceover] Yes. - [Melanie Voiceover] Say "How are you feeling?" - How are you feeling? - We've been at this a long time, but she's doing so good, really. - Thanks, sweetie. I'm happy you're finally here. - Yes, I'm here to be your doula for you. - [Melanie Voiceover] Nope, don't improvise. - It's really uncomfortable around here. I took a really long shower and that helped but... Oh. - Oh, breathe, baby. - [Johnny Voiceover] Should I rub her back? - [Melanie Voiceover] I think we need to apologize for being so late. - I need to move, I need to walk. - Okay, are you sure? Let's go. - Okay. - [Melanie Voiceover] Say "I'm sorry I'm so late". - I'm- - Melanie, can you see who that is please? (phone ringing) - Ruby? - Ruby is the midwife. - Oh, good! - So... - [Melanie Voiceover] Yeah, answer it. - Hello? - Hi, Sharon, is that you? - [Priya] Can you get me some juice? - Yeah, no, um, this is Melanie. - Oh, hey, Melanie. - It's in the fridge! - Yes. - [Ruby] Listen, I planned to be there by now. I probably should have left earlier. How is everything going? How's Priya doing? - [Melanie Voiceover] Just say "Everything is fine". - Everything's fine. - [Ruby] That's good. Look, I'm so sorry I'm running late. I don't know how long it's gonna take me to get there, traffic is terrible. - Shit. - Shit. - I know. - No, don't repeat everything! - No, don't rep... Oh. - What? - Nothing. - Look, call me if you need anything. I'll be there as soon as I can, okay? - Okay. - Oh, and one more thing... - [Melanie Voiceover] Look, Johnny, this is getting really serious now. (juice splatters) What was that? - [Johnny Voiceover] Nothing. - [Melanie Voiceover] You know what? This is not gonna work. You've gotta try to figure out how to let go. - [Johnny Voiceover] I am, I'm trying. (Priya moaning) - [Sharon] You good? - Your phone. - Oh. - Juice. - Thanks. - Is Ruby close? - Yes. - Yes. - When's she getting here? - [Melanie Voiceover] She'll be here very soon. - [Johnny Voiceover] That's not true. - [Priya] Does this juice have like a funny after taste? - [Melanie Voiceover] She will be here very soon, Johnny. - No, she said she's stuck in traffic. - Say it. - She'll be here very soon. - [Sharon] Okay. No, it tastes fine. - Really? - Yes. You've said everything tastes weird all day. - [Priya] Melanie, you try. It tastes kinda weird, right? Funky. - [Sharon] There's nothing wrong with the juice! - Sweetie, can you just get me my water? - [Sharon] Yeah, sure. - [Priya] I'm gonna give you my weight, okay? - Melanie. - Oh God. - [Johnny Voiceover] I can't taste the juice. - [Melanie Voiceover] What do you mean? - [Johnny Voiceover] I don't know. It doesn't taste like anything. - [Sharon] Here, honey. Your water. - I need to sit down. - Okay, come here. - Yeah. - [Johnny Voiceover] Isn't that kinda weird? - Johnny- - Here we go. - [Melanie Voiceover] Don't worry about the juice, okay? You have to focus. - Melanie. - Feels like he's kicking. - [Melanie Voiceover] Tell her fetal movement is a good thing. - It's a good thing. - It's uncomfortable. - Water? (Priya hums) - [Melanie Voiceover] Go rub her hips. - What are you doing? - Um- - Say what you're doing. - I'm rubbing her hips. Your hips. - Now tell her to take a slow breath. - What? - Tell her to... (light music) - [Johnny Voiceover] Something is going on with your voice. - [Priya] I gotta pee again. - Okay, let's go. - It's like I need to go but I can't. (Melanie's voice garbling) - [Johnny Voiceover] What? - [Melanie Voiceover] I'm saying that (garbled talking). - [Johnny Voiceover] I can't understand what you're saying. - [Priya] I can't go anymore. - [Melanie Voiceover] I'm right here. (light music) - Could you light some of that incense? - [Melanie] Yeah. (lighter clicks) - [Johnny Voiceover] I couldn't hear anything you were saying back there. - [Melanie Voiceover] Johnny, I can't really hear you anymore... - [Johnny Voiceover] I can't smell this stuff. - [Melanie Voiceover] I don't, I don't know what's going on. Johnny, (garbled talking) - [Johnny Voiceover] What? (dramatic whooshing) Melanie? - [Sharon] Melanie, can you come help, please? - Uh huh. - [Sharon] Good, okay. - Open subconscious. - Okay. - All right? - Yeah. - [Johnny Voiceover] Melanie? Hello? - All right. - Okay, got ya. - Okay, that's good. Come help. - Alright, okay. - You wanna just grab my leg? Can you help? - [Melanie] Like this? (water splashing) - There you go. (Priya sighs) Okay. - Okay. - Okay. Uh, could you grab one of those towels? - [Johnny Voiceover] Melanie? Please answer me. - [Priya] Honey, can you get me a mirror? - [Sharon] Yeah. - Here. - Thanks. My arms, they keep shaking. See? - Uh huh. - [Priya] Is that...? What do you think? - Um...

Yeah, um, music. - [Sharon] How about that one playlist? - Playlist, yes. Playlist. How do I- - The one that you showed us on your phone. - Phone. Oh, yeah. Um... (rock music) Oh, sorry. Oh, that's a podcast. (upbeat music) This is a good song. - You know, don't worry about it. - Okay. (Priya sighs) - Something's wrong. - What do you mean? - [Priya] The pain is like really sharp. Shouldn't Ruby be here? - [Sharon] You said she was on her way, right? - Um- - Is that the smoke alarm? (Priya sighs) (Sharon sighs) (doorbell rings) (Priya groans) - Should I get that? - Uh-huh - Okay. (Priya groans) - Hey, Melanie, I'm so sorry I'm late. Is she pushing yet? - Ruby, is that you?

But I'll see you and Johnny soon. - Okay. (light dramatic music) (Priya groaning) (phone thuds) (light dramatic music continues) - [Ruby] Melanie? I'll be right there, you're doing great. There you go. - Hi, hi. Do you think this is gonna take a long time? - Why? Do you have somewhere else you need to be? - No, no, I, I... I just wanna know if it's gonna take awhile. - Well, you know how this goes. He's gonna come when he's ready. - Okay. - I'm gonna check, okay? (Priya groans) Okay. Here's my touch. There's my hand nice and slow. You're doing great. - [Johnny Voiceover] Melanie? - [Ruby] Nine and a half, you're almost there. - Is that... (light dramatic music) - I need you.

Johnny! - Melanie. - [Ruby] Melanie. - Yeah? - [Ruby] Can you grab the mirror? - [Sharon] Yeah, it's over there. - [Ruby] I want you to see this, Priya. The head is starting to crown. - Oh, my god! (light music) (glass shatters) - I'm sorry. - It's okay, it's all good. There's a dust pan in the closet. - Everyone's wearing shoes? - I can't do this! - Yes, you can, Priya. Yes, you can. - You're gonna push again. - No, I can't, I really can't. - You can do this. - Yes, you can. (light dramatic music) (Priya groans) - [Johnny Voiceover] I'm scared. - [Melanie Voiceover] I'm right here with you. (Priya groans) (muffled talking) - [Ruby] Melanie, you're going to hold this knee, okay? - Okay. - On the next one you are going to lean forward. (light music continues) We've got the head. (Priya yells) (muffled talking) (light music continues) Almost there. Good, good. (water splashing) (baby cries) (Priya groans) Melanie? (Melanie gasps) - [Melanie Voiceover] Johnny? (light music continues) (dramatic whooshing) (Johnny groans) (birds chirping) (phone ringing) - [Johnny] Hi, this is Johnny's phone. - [Voicemail] At the tone, please record your message. - [Melanie] Um, hi, Johnny. It's Melanie. I guess I don't really know what to say. Um, I woke up, or whatever here at Priya's house and she's okay and the baby is healthy and I'm, I'm fine. Yeah, I, I guess I just wanted to make sure that you're okay. So, let me know. (light music) (birds chirping) (door thuds) - [Claire] Hello? Johnny? Are you guys here? What do I need? Hey, there you are. You look all worn out. How are you feeling? - Fine. - [Claire] Yeah? Where's Melanie? - [Johnny] Oh, she left. - Did she leave you alone? - No, she uh, left when she saw you drive in. - Oh. That's too bad. I wanted to say goodbye. (light music) Did you and Melanie go outside today? Johnny? (light music) You're not hungry? (Johnny hums) (knocking) Who is that? Hi, Melanie! - Hi. - [Claire] Oh, I'm so glad. I thought I wasn't gonna get to say goodbye to you. - Yeah, I thought so too, but I'm glad we get to say goodbye now. - [Claire] Would you like to stay for dinner? - [Melanie] Oh no, that's okay, I can't. I um, I have some stuff that I forgot here and I... Hi. - Do you know where Melanie's stuff is? - Yeah. - I guess these are my things. - Mm-hm. - [Johnny] What's that? - Found this stuff in my room. I think it's your mom's. - [Johnny] Oh. - [Melanie] So, we can talk about it if you want. - I think this is yours. - Oh yeah, I was looking for that. (Melanie sighs) You can keep it. - [Johnny] Really? - Yeah, sure. Bye. (door squeaks) (light music) - [Johnny Voiceover] Being in you made me feel like I could do anything. Outside there are things that feel bad, but there are also things that feel good. And if you just stay home you don't get to feel any of it. - All right, mister. (knocking) - Come in. - We better hit the road. - I'm ready. - Did Melanie give you that? - Yes. - It looks nice on you. - I know.
