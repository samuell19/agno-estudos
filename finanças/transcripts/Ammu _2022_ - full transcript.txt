Ammu! Are you really going to marry our neighbour, Mr. Ravi? Yeah! Why? Do you like him? I think so. Why do you like him? I don't know. I just do. Then why are you marrying him? Why? Do you want to marry him? Me? No way! What do you mean? I find him very scary! Why are you scared of him? Did he say something to you? No. But the mere sight of him scares me. He is so huge. Whenever my friends and I play near his motorcycle... he'd keep glaring at us. And we'd just run away. Are you not afraid, Ammu? But you're rowdy yourself! - Everyone should be scared of you! - Don't tickle me, Ammu. Why would you be scared? - Ammu, don't tickle me! - Ammu, what are you doing? Look, you are wrinkling your saree! Are you a child? Everyone's waiting for you there, but here you are, playing! - Come. - Mom... What? Is everything okay? Everything is okay. Come. Come sit here, Ammu. Be comfortable. You don't have to be formal with us. It's not like we're meeting for the first time. Be yourself. This one time, I saw her quarreling with the water lorry guy. She seemed like a brave girl! But look at her now, all innocent. I can hardly believe it's the same person. No doubts, Mr. Subramaniam. It's the same brave girl. They're giving you grades. Those days are over, brother. Now that she is becoming your daughter-in-law... being obedient is good. We've been neighbours all these years. These two could have just fallen in love - and spared us the trouble! - Isn't it? That's our upbringing. True. Our kids have made us proud! Ammu, he is stealing glances at you. I know! Ammu! Why don't you stand next to Ravi? Let's see how you look together! - Go ahead, Ravi. - Dad. Come on. Go ahead. Go. Hey... What is it? Hey! Ammu, what happened? Ammu... What time do you need to go to work tomorrow? I need to be there by 7:00 a.m. Can't be late on my first day. Eat breakfast before you go. Okay. What about lunch? Will you be coming home? I can't. Not during the first few days. There must be restaurants around. I'll figure it out. So tell me, will you be fine alone at home? Don't remind me of that! I'm scared as it is. I have never been by myself my whole life. Scared of what? Who would dare to mess with the inspector's wife? And what will the inspector do if someone messed with his wife? I swear on my mother, I'll cut him in half. Oh, my! My husband is a hero! The three lions on our emblem represent morality, justice, and righteousness. The invisible fourth lion is the policeman. Superb! Tell me. What do you want? For what? The dialogue? No. It's been a few days since we got married. I thought I should buy you a gift. Tell me what you want. Take your own sweet time! Sorry. I just remembered. I gave my sewing machine to my mother before I came here. I want a new sewing machine. I thought you would ask for a teddy bear, chocolate or a saree! This sounds expensive. How badly do you want it? You think I'm a child to ask for toys or a pacifier? Yes. Aren't you a child? No! What do you want a sewing machine for? To earn. What? A man who lives off his wife's money is no man at all. Why? Does it make you a lesser man if I make some money? I don't mind staying at home and living off your money! But I promised your parents. That I'd take good care of you. As a man, it is my duty to fulfill all of my wife's needs. So you will fulfill "all" my needs? - Coffee... - So? Not here. What happened? - Can I get you another? - No. Music has blossomed as tunes Gently brushing the lips with joy Sweetness overflowing like honey Deep down my heart In these beautiful black eyes Are years of dreams pouring Collided with the body at dawn -Like a bright lightening -So much has changed. You like it? In this ripe age - I do! - In these decorated footsteps Hundreds of years of vows with me Stay together... forever Beauty like a flower Spread like a sandal paste A knitted bond Essence of Happiness Reflects in the mirror Feet danced to the tunes I found something in the shower. Isn't this yours? It's not mine. Not yours? - And what did you do? - I told you! She is Linny, our neighbour. - She is a school teacher. - Hello. Our new Circle Inspector, Ravindranath. What were you and my mother discussing? They are bored. She asked when we're planning to have a baby. I accept that they are bored. - But what about you? - "But what about you?" Heart laid out like a carpet Gaze longing Like a doorway Hopes dancing Like the waves Every moment is a celebration Dedicated to this bond Tender age has become musical Passing in a easy-breezy way First months are becoming canopies Time has frozen, filled with cuddles Little smiles Never ending desires Spreading like wealth Heart filled with joy Beauty like a flower Spread like a sandal paste A knitted bond In all these years, I've never seen anyone's wife bring them lunch. Madam clearly loves you a lot. May you both always be happy! Madam... a gift from sir. A knitted bond Essence of happiness Reflects in the mirror Feet danced to the tunes I love you. What happened? I love you. A surprise inspection? Yes, sir. It was one of our DIG's routine surprise inspections. The CI had just left the station on some personal work. The weapons room was left unlocked. The FIR copies weren't organized. One officer wasn't clean shaven. The DIG waited for the CI to return and personally handed him the suspension letter. The CI, two SIs, and two constables... were suspended and sent packing without second thought. - Which station was it, sir? - None of your business! Look what they've done to my daughter! - Sir! - Sir! Sit over there. - What's the case? - Molestation case, sir. We're just registering their complaint. - Please sit. Look into this. - Okay, sir. - Iqbal sir... - Sir? Look what those mongrels - have done to my daughter. - Ma'am. If you had kept a close watch on your daughter's activities, such a thing wouldn't have happened. What's the point of crying now? What more can I do, sir? I work all day and get home late at night. Her father is useless. How can I keep an eye on her at all times? The police can't do much in such cases. There are only ten policemen for the whole neighbourhood. We can't safeguard every street. You gave birth to her. You should take care of her! - Why are you... - Man so or! Sir. They are here for our help. If not us, who will help them? That's not what I meant, sir. It's our responsibility to protect her. Not just her. It is our responsibility to keep all the women in our jurisdiction safe. I didn't mean to... Don't worry, madam. I'll definitely find the culprits. Also... I'll make sure this doesn't happen to any other girl. That's all I want, sir. Look... don't feel ashamed. Those who did this to you, they should be ashamed! Not you. Good. Take her home. Thanks, sir. - Sorry, sir. - It's okay. - Iqbal sir. - Sir? Let's announce a volunteer program and get help from the public. - Okay, sir. - Let's call for volunteers. Ask them to patrol the streets, and if they find anything suspicious - ask them to report to us at once. - Will do, sir. Our eyes and ears alone won't do. Something like the Neighbourhood Saviours initiative by the Karnataka Police? Yes. Community policing will improve the safety of our streets. - Yes, sir. - Right, sir. We will have better intel. Ensure that everyone is made aware of this program. We need at least one volunteer from every street. This is a very good idea, sir. But won't we need to seek the DIG's approval to implement it? - I will talk to him right away. - Okay, sir. It will be even better if he were to announce it. - Okay? - Okay, sir. Okay, sir. - It looks great, Ammu! - I know, right? It's the latest model. Must have cost at least 10,000 rupees. Your husband must love you a lot. Yes. And so last night, I finally said... "I love you" to him. How cute! Is that him? - Hello! I was just talking about you... - Where the hell are you? It's past 1:00 p.m. Where are you roaming around? - I'm at home... - You're at home? What are you doing? I was just... You do know I am waiting for lunch, right? Lunch? Are you bringing my lunch or not? Well... it took me longer to prepare lunch today. I'm bringing it to you right away. Hello? I'll ask you something. Tell me the truth. Please! Did it really take you longer to cook? Or did you forget that you had to bring my lunch? Or did you think it wasn't your responsibility to cook for me? Tell me. Ammu... you better understand this. This is a police station. And I'm a police officer. You will get caught if you lie. I didn't know I had to bring you lunch today. What happened? - Ravi! - I don't need your charity. Thanks for taking the effort to bring me lunch. That's not what I meant. Please, Ravi. Come and eat. - Please! It won't happen again. - I know exactly what you meant. I swear, I won't trouble you ever again. I will learn to take care of myself. Sorry for bothering you. I am so sorry, Ravi. - I didn't mean to... - Unlike you, I have a lot of work to do. If you don't mind, stay put for ten minutes and then leave. People will start making assumptions if you leave right away... and it won't look good. I don't know why you say that, Ravi. Please eat, Ravi. - Come! - Ammu! Ravi! Ravi... Sathya! Yes, sir? - Get an auto for madam. - Okay, sir. How was your day? Please eat. I don't feel hungry. You eat. Okay? Good night. Can you please let me sleep? I won't. Why are you so desperate? Can't you live without sex for one day? - Hello, madam. - Hello. - I've brought lunch for him. - Okay, madam. Please come in. Neighborhood Saviours. We are calling for the public to volunteer. They will be on surveillance round-the-clock. If something untoward happens, they will intimate us. And we will take action immediately. We will be implementing this across all the stations under my jurisdiction. With the help of this program, we expect a significant fall in crime rates. All the credit for this idea goes to... our CI Ravindranath. He is one of our brightest police officers. Soon, we will be implementing the Neighbourhood Saviours model... We are very proud of you, sir. - Wow! - Yes, sir. - Sir, you must drink today! - Yes, sir. - No way. - Why not? Because it's been ages since I last drank. That doesn't matter, sir. You must drink with us tonight. - Make an exception tonight. - Have this once, sir. Madam... what do you say? May I go ahead and drink? Why do you ask me? Let him drink this one time. - Please let him drink, madam. - Hey! Why would I stop him? - Madam has granted permission! - Sir! Pour him a drink. - Go ahead. - Okay. Hurry up! - Raise your glasses. - Okay. - Cheers! - Cheers! Iqbal sir, time to begin. Wow, Iqbal sir! What a classic song! Wonderful! Wow! Sir, next line please! - Hold on a moment. - Yes, sir? Tell us. I have something to say, Iqbal sir. Naresh, do you have any idea how lucky you are? Your wife loves you so much, and waits on you hand and foot. How romantic! They say a man's karma decides what kind of wife he ends up with. You must have done a lot of good in your previous life. You've been blessed with such a devout wife. Oh, come on, sir. I don't think I am blessed at all. Forgive me, God. I'm a sinner. - What do you mean, sir? - What's this, sir? Come on, sir! What are you saying, sir? Madam has been bringing you lunch every single day for a whole month. - She loves you a lot. - Correct, sir. - You are one lucky man. - True. No Iqbal, you know nothing. That was a one-time thing. She forgot the very next day. Really? Is that true, madam? I had to shamelessly call her and beg for food. Stop it, sir. Madam is not like that. You don't believe me? I am telling you! She doesn't give a damn about me. She spends all day on her sewing machine... but it's my poor heart that gets pricked by the sewing needle. Don't say that, sir. That's not true. They say, lust lasts for a week, and love lasts for a month. Really? After which, death is all that's left to look forward to. There he goes. Perfect timing! We got completely drenched, didn't we? What happened? What's with the long face? Don't you know? Why did you insult me in front of everybody? I felt terrible. It was just a joke. Why'd you take it seriously? It wasn't funny. All I do is think about you, all day and all night. You do know that, don't you? Oh? So you think you care for me better than every other wife in town? I didn't say that. Just don't talk as though I don't take care of you. Especially in front of your colleagues. What would they think of me? How does it matter what they think? How can you say that? What if they think poorly of me? Are you okay with it? Fine. What if I'd asked you if you knew what time I eat lunch every day? Would you have had an answer? Take a moment to think about that. Are you coming with me or not? First answer my question. Have you ever thought about my feelings? Have you ever asked me if I've eaten? Who do I say all this to? Fine. You walk home. Ravi! The auto driver needs to be paid. Hey! Sir! - Get it from the station tomorrow. - Okay, sir. Have you learnt your lesson now? The next time you talk such rubbish... I won't let you in the house. If you do this again, I won't come back home. I mean it. Sorry! I shouldn't have done that. I got annoyed because you threatened to not come back home. You know that I can't live without you. So don't you know it would hurt me when you say such things? That is why I couldn't control my rage. This isn't the real me. You know I am very sensitive. Oh, no! I ruined your clothes. I'm sorry. Did it take you too long to find an auto? Are you hungry? Would you like to eat dosa? Go and get changed. I'll make you dosa. Damn it! I've made a mess, haven't I? I'll clean it up. Go on. What's this, son-in-law? I know you took a huge loan to pay for our wedding. Just a little something from me. Please accept it. No, son-in-law. This isn't right. Aunty, call me Ravi. To you, I will always be Ravi. Don't be so formal with me. If my parents owed someone money... would I not help them repay it? Ammu... tell them to take it. Take it, Dad. Thanks, son-in-law. Aunty! I mean Ravi. I'll just go to the market and buy fish. Let's make the lunch special today. Fine. I'll be back. What happened, Ammu? Why are you crying? What is it, Ammu? You can talk to your mother. Is there a problem? Ma... Why did you get me married so soon? So soon? You are 25! If we'd waited any longer, it would have been your diamond jubilee! Why couldn't you let me stay with you a little longer? Now I can't even see you when I want. That is life, Ammu. I don't like this life. I want to live with you. You shouldn't have gotten me married. What's this, Ammu? Sorry. It slipped off my hands while I was cleaning. Don't trouble yourself. Let me take care of it. It's okay, Aunty. I'm used to it. Are you angry with me? No. I know you are angry. Tell me what happened. You know I like eating on the couch, don't you? Yes, I do. Why didn't you tell them? They wanted to eat with you. So I didn't tell them. It was just the one time. No one gives a damn about me. Whose house is this? Mine or theirs? Why are you making a big deal out of this? Ravi... Wait! - What happened? - I won't stay here a minute longer - and listen to you speak this way! - Ravi... Ravi, listen to me. Don't leave. It won't look nice. Please! Ravi... Ravi, don't leave. What would I tell my parents? They are visiting us for the first time. Let them return home in peace with the notion that I am happy. - Please don't leave. - Oh, so you are not happy? Fine, if you are not happy... why are you still here? You can leave with them. I don't want to see any of you when I return. Ravi... I'm talking to you... Ammu! Ammu! Ammu! Listen to me. Listen, Ammu... Listen to me. Listen to me. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. Please listen. I didn't mean to slap you. Okay, alright! You are angry now. I didn't mean to slap you. It's all because you made me angry, and took my key away. I'm sorry. Ammu... Ammu, please. You know how much I love you, don't you? As your parents wished... shouldn't we lead a happy life? Come on. I love you. Ammu, I love you. I'm sorry. Ammu, I am sorry. Ammu, sorry. I love you. Ammu, I am sorry. Ammu, I am sorry. I'm sorry, Ammu. I'm sorry. Alright! Fine. Alright? Okay now? - Ravi. - Yes? We are getting late for the temple. Let's eat ice cream and then go. Okay? Let's go. Don't be scared. Smile! I came here twelve years back - on an official visit. - Oh? You said you came with the SP? Is this where you came? Yes. Kalpana, we're going to wash our feet. You carry on. Come on. Ammu, look there. It's so beautiful, isn't it? I can't tell you how happy I am for you both. Before I came here, I was worried that... you weren't happy here... and that he wasn't taking good care of you. But he has surpassed all my expectations. He hit me. He slapped me, Ma. Why? What did you do? Why do you assume it was something I did? Because he is a good person. - If you hadn't done anything... - So what? If I did something, is it okay for him to slap me? That's not what I meant, Ammu. Don't argue. What do you want me to say now? I don't know. I don't know what mothers say to daughters at a time like this. Let me tell you what my mother told me... when your father hit me. Dad hit you? Just once. But it really hurt me. Then my mother sat me down and said... "men hit their wives." You are not the first woman to go through this. And you will not be the last. It will likely happen again to you. Men are entitled to anger. Because they go to work. They lead stressful lives. Where else can they take out their frustration? They can only take it out on us. If you want his love, you must bear the pain that comes with it. "The only solution to all your problems, is a child." That was my mother's advice. Everything fell in place after I had you. But that's not what she should have said. Then what? A man should never raise his hand at his wife. And if he does... the woman needn't continue to live with him for another moment. What do you want me to do now, Ma? Ammu... do what you think is right. Otherwise, someday... you'd also be complaining about your mother to your daughter. Bye, Ammu. Ravi, bye. Ammu, come inside. Ammu? I told you I will get the files. Why are you rushing me? I told you, I will be there by 8:00 or 8:15. Has the DIG started? Fine, I'm coming. Hurry up. I need to leave right away. Alright, don't move. Or the needle might prick you. I smell something burning. Oh, no! Keep stirring. Is that my job? I only have two hands. You idiot! Can't you do anything right? Here comes the waterworks. You always screw things up and piss me off. But if I react, you cry your way out of it. And I end up looking like the villain. Very clever of you. Your parents have done a fine job raising you! That was uncalled for. Something is burning again! Are you completely stupid? I am to blame, for getting married to you. You idiot! You'd better not be here when I return. If I see you around again, no one can save you. Madam... Sir. Sir... Those tears won't get you anywhere. You can choose to be strong and face your problems... or live with it. Madam... There is no other way. Sir... I didn't ask for your advice. Mind your business. This is my business. I sit here all day long and beg people for money. What do you know about me? What do I know? Nuptial thread around the neck. Bruises on the face. Eyes brimming with tears. And a bag in hand. You're wondering whether to leave your abusive husband or continue living with him. I see a lot of women like you. And you dispense advice to all of them? I don't even like humans. I love dogs. Because, just like me... they wander here amidst the people who yell at them, with nowhere else to go. And the puppies... they get lost, or injured. When someone tries to be nice to them... they bark at them, or bite them. That is not anger, but fear. To make them overcome their fear... There is only one way. And what is that? Do you have money? I thought you were going to give me advice... but you are eating biryani with my money! How do I tell you what you already know? What do I know? I don't know anything. I don't even know what I did wrong, that he had to hit me. The only thing I know... is to get beaten up and cry shamelessly. What sort of life is this? You see what I just did? Though I'm not at fault... I'm blaming myself. How did I become this person? Why does he lose his temper in the first place? Why does he hit me? I don't even understand what I am doing wrong. But I know he is not a bad person. He is not a monster. He takes very good care of me. It's not like he has no love for me. But sometimes... due to the things that happen around him... he gets frustrated and behaves that way. If only those files had not caught fire this morning... he wouldn't have hit me. It is not entirely his fault. But I can't bring myself to make peace with it. This doesn't happen everyday. Some days, we are so happy... that we don't even fight. Come to think of it, most days, we are actually good. But sometimes... something like this happens. That's all. Just because we have these rare fights... doesn't mean we should end the relationship, right? Is that how you feel? Of course. Despite all this, if I keep showering him with all my love... and try to understand him better... won't he change at some point? So, I just need to make him love me so much that he would never hurt me. All will be good if I make him love me that much. What do you think? What happened? I didn't expect it would turn out this way. What? The biryani. Buy me biryani the next time we meet. May God bless you. Were you thinking of leaving me? Yes. But I couldn't. Why? You are my everything. I know. I could never leave you. I know. I will be with you forever. You mean the world to me. What is this? We are going for an official function. Who are you trying to seduce by dressing up like this? In this time Which does not stop or move Rumbles of thousand Oceans in my heart I was wondering if I could go for a movie with our neighbour Sudha Aunty. Then who would cook for me? No need. - Just this once, please? - Don't you get it? No need. Okay. Yesterday's dream has stopped Have a sweet, sir. My wife is pregnant. Oh, okay. - Really? - And exposed me to the reality This moment transformed Like an illusion Do I stay or do I leave? This endless suffering Will it ever stop I wonder I don't want a baby now, doctor. But he doesn't understand. In that case, you have to take pills. But silence is not a solution. No, doctor. Everything will be fine. I'm sure of that. Doctor, can you do me a favour? Having intercourse on other days won't help. But if you want to conceive, have intercourse only on the 11th, 12th and 13th day after your period. Hey, Linny! She is the Neighbourhood Saviour volunteer here. They will patrol the streets every night... and alert us of any suspicious activity. This was sir's idea. Are you happy, Ammu? He takes good care of me. Don't worry, Ma. In this garden Where my hopes began to blossom Swaying to the breezy winds But alas came the scorching heat And changed my path into a desert My dreams have come to a halt The river of tears have been dammed Do I stay or Do I leave This endless suffering Will it ever stop I wonder This anguish... Ammu... Ammu! Did you understand what I just said? Yes, doctor. I'm pregnant. But how? Ammu, contraceptive pills lead to increased progesterone levels... but your levels appear to be normal. But I did take the pills. In that case... is it possible that your husband knew about the pills and swapped them? I wish I had good news for you, Ravi. But she has missed her period. Yeah, that could be because of PCOD, or hormonal imbalance. Or sometimes, even stress. Ammu is not pregnant. I'm very sure about it. And Ravi, one more thing. She is very weak. It's not enough if you want a baby. Look after your wife first. You have to take good care of her. Do you understand? What? Sir, I heard a woman screaming. It sounded like someone hit her. I'm not sure where it came from. So what do you want me to do? Sacrifice my sleep and do your job for you? That wasn't what I meant. Sorry, sir. Call Sathya. Okay, sir. Linny, wait. Actually, I think I've heard it once too. Yeah? Fine, do this. I will ask Sathya to join you. Go to each house and make inquiries. Okay, sir. Thank you. - Okay. - Sorry, sir. - It's okay. - Good night. What? Get inside. We weren't able to find out who screamed last night. We checked every house. We inquired them in every possible ways... but we couldn't find out anything. I was so sure we'd be able to find out. I knew we wouldn't. Women generally hide such issues. But why? We are here to help them! I've come across many such women at the station. They never admit that their husbands physically abused them. Instead, they defend their husbands. They are conditioned that way. I don't get it. Maybe you'd get it if you were in their place. Anyway, it's almost lunchtime. Do you want to come with me to the station? No. I am leaving too, Ammu. Okay, ma'am. Wait. You've missed one house. I feel embarrassed... to share this. I despise myself. No matter what he does to me... I keep quiet and put up with it. Sometimes, I wonder... if having a child would change him for better. But what if he doesn't change? That is why I took those pills without his knowledge. But... I am no match for his cunning mind. I don't know what to do with this baby. Should I keep the baby or not? But that has to be my decision. Not his... or anybody else's. How could he do this without my knowledge? What right does he have over my body? What right does he have? Tell me! Did I marry such a horrible person? Did I marry him to lead such a miserable life? We came to you because we didn't know what to do. There is only one thing to do. We have to file a complaint to DIG Reddy. What? A crime is a crime, no matter who commits it. I don't want to file a complaint. I'll just go away somewhere. Go. But he can't go unpunished. I'm not that brave. I can't file a complaint against him. You need a reason to file for a divorce. And this is the reason. I can't. Why are you afraid? We are all here for you. Ammu, be strong and come with us. Nothing will happen to you. Okay, madam. But the DIG is in a meeting. - Please come with me. - Where? Ravi sir comes here every day. If he were to find her here... What's this, Ammu? You shouldn't have done this. I come to the DIG's office every day. And if you file a complaint with him against me... what would everyone think of me? You shouldn't have done this. Come on. Sit. Miss Sathya, please sit. Ammu, what is your problem? You don't like me. I know that. But why do you hate me so much? Sir... Miss Sathya. Please don't interfere. This is our personal matter. You hitting her is not a personal matter, sir. I hit her? Did I hit you? Is that what you have been telling people? Miss Sathya, you've known me for a year now. You think I would hit her? You really think so? It is natural for any man and wife to go through rough times. But to blow it up... and drag the DIG into it... Don't you see it? She is not mentally right. You don't believe me? Ammu... Do I hit you? Everyone is watching. Answer me. Do I hit you? Is that enough, Miss Sathya? Ammu... let's go. What are you doing, Ammu? I'm cleaning. There is dust, dirt, and filth all over the place. It wasn't this way when I first came here. I stopped paying attention, and look what's become of it! Not just the house... I stopped taking care of myself too. I've become a shameless person. Maybe that's why, when he dragged me out of there... I couldn't even stand up for myself. But nothing can stop me now. I can't wait for somebody to come and help me. If something needs to be done, I must do it myself. What can we do about it, Ammu? First, I will clean the mess at home, and then I deal with him. What? I need to teach him a lesson. I need to expose his true colours to everybody. Not just me. He must not dare to raise his hand at anybody. Then I will look him in the eye, and walk away from him. I will never return. But how? We just let go of the only chance we had. I don't know how. But it must happen. There has to be a way. Some way. A puppetry show Life is an illusion A puppetry show Life is an illusion A parrot is peacefully sitting on a tree It's encircled by a mischievous gang Uncle, I can't believe she is getting married already! The last time I met her, she was just a little girl. My baby sister. That look in her eyes when the police dragged me away... I still remember it vividly. She will probably look at you the same way even now. Will she be okay with me attending her wedding? How would she be okay? She will create a scene. I have to be at her wedding. This is my last chance to fix things with her. Uncle, I want to see her. You just got out. Get some rest. We'll see her this evening. I want to see her right now! You never listen to me. Uncle... our childhood photo. Hey, Geetha is here! Let's see her once before we leave. Did you see her? Are you happy now? My heart is full. She is all grown up. She looks exactly like our mother. Okay, we need to go to the station now. - What's the complaint about? - Family issues... - How is he related to you? - My nephew. - You are his guardian? - Yes, sir. - You are aware of the parole conditions? - Yes, sir. He must come here everyday... - and sign the register. - Alright, sir. - Fish curry? - What? Is that fish curry? Yes. My mother used to make it for me when I was a kid. It was delicious. My father would catch fresh fish from the stream. Mum would chop it into tiny bits... marinate it in salt and spices... and add a handful of jaggery in the end, just for me. Yummy! It would taste so good. It was out of this world! Why don't you go and get the lunch ready? I'll come. You've got a big mouth. I heard you were quite popular in prison. Your warden had a lot to say about you. You mean Mr. Rao? He is a really nice person. Your antics may impress the prison officers. But it won't fly here. I rule this place. Try to act smart, and I will thrash you... and put you behind bars forever. According to Prison SP's conditions... you have to sign the register twice everyday, morning and evening. If you even miss it once... I will cancel your parole and send you back to prison. Just twice a day? I would even sign 200 times a day. Can I sign now and leave? Hang on! - What's the hurry? - Sir... Do you have some important meeting to attend? No, sir. I need to tell you something. Hope you don't mistake me. Sir? The toilet drain here is clogged. Our men tried to unclog it, but they just couldn't. If you don't mind... It's not a big task. It will only take two minutes. If you have a problem, you don't have to do it. No problem, sir. I'll do it. Search thoroughly. If we don't find the gun, I'll lose my job. - Look everywhere. - Wait! Check those shelves. - What is it, sir? - Go! Sir! How did you get this? - I found it lying there. - Did you find it or steal it? Why would I steal it, sir? This was mum's ring, right? You had it with you all these years? No... I don't want anything coming from him. Even if it belonged to Mum. Geetha... I admit I committed a terrible crime. Forgive me, Geetha. If you don't forgive me, I will die. Then die. Had he given a thought about me, he wouldn't have killed those two men. If my sister forgives me... - Are you blind? - Let go. I'm saying this out of experience, just let it go. Sorry. Do you people have any brains? The guy is on parole... The moron Prabhu hasn't come to sign yet. So? If he doesn't turn up, we are doomed. Especially Ravi Sir. Hello. What happened? He's already committed two murders. What if he commits another? He is here, sir. Please spare him, sir. Where the hell were you, you scumbag? Sir, please forgive him. I will make sure - this doesn't happen again. - Hey! If he does this again... I swear, I will break his bones and put him behind bars. Clean under the table, those files... the cobwebs in the ceiling, and then the toilets... What happened, Ammu? Did you get scared? She gets scared like a little girl. Sit with me. Let's eat together. I'm taking this ring only because it was mum's. But I will never forgive you. My wish has come true. My sister has accepted me. Drink all you want. It's on me tonight. Hey! I'm sparing you only because I am in a good mood. You should thank my sister for this. In that case... send your sister over to me. Hey, big guys. I thought you were grown ups. But you came and complained here like school children. You haven't learnt your lesson despite all the beatings. What kind of a person are you? Sir... ten years back... I wouldn't have let you even touch me. But I must admit, you are simply superb, sir! You only pick on those who won't dare to hit you back. Am I correct, madam? Sathya madam, am I correct? - Diwakar, he will never learn. - Sir. Get the letter pad. - Write down my statement. - Sir! "Dear, sir. Subject... Request to cancel the parole of Prabhu, who murdered two men." Please don't do it, sir. - "Despite several warnings... - Forgive me once. Prabhu has taken the law into his own hands... - Sir. - And severely beat up two men yesterday who had to be hospitalised." Brother... - Please withdraw your complaint, brother. - They are critical. - I beg you. - "An FIR has been filed against Prabhu." - Iqbal sir, please. - He will not listen to me. Go and ask him. "I request you to cancel his parole..." We are helpless, Prabhu. - "And imprison him again." - Go and ask him. - "Please do the needful." - Sir... Please forgive me this one time. I came out on parole only to attend my sister's wedding. "Your sincerely... - S Ravindranath..." - Sir. - Circle Inspector... - Sir, I want to see her get married. Maharanipalli Police Station." Please, sir. Forgive me this one time. - Sir, please. - Move away. I have to attend my sister's wedding. Please, sir. You said something about what you'd have done ten years back? Sorry, sir. This is your parole cancellation letter. Sir. I'm going to fax this to the Prison SP right now. Don't do it, sir. Do what you can. Diwakar! You win, sir. You win, sir. I am nothing. I'm nothing. Punish me if you wish to. Prabhu, don't... You came here to serve me lunch, right? Serve it. That's enough, all of you. Let him be. He looks like he might die. Spare him. Hey! Go ahead, Shekar. What? The DIG is on his way here for an inspection, sir. - Check the weapons room. - Yes, sir. Check if the FIRs have been updated. Lock up, canteen... everything needs to be tidy. - Your uniforms, too. - Yes, sir. - Iqbal! - Sir? Where are you taking him? - To his home. - Don't, sir. Let's file an FIR and lock him up. Tie up his limbs, gag his mouth - and put him in the toilet. - Yes, sir. I will file the FIR after we skin him alive. Take him away. Ammu, the DIG will be here any moment. You can't be here. Leave now. Ammu, don't you have any sense? You can't do one thing right? - Sathya! - Yes, sir? - Clean up this mess. - Yes, sir. Let's go, sir. Let me do it. Sir, the DIG's car is here. - Sathya, go and handle him. - Yes, sir. - Come here. - Where? If the DIG sees you here, I am doomed. - Please, not the toilet. - Come on. But he is inside. So what? He was taking your side anyway. - Ravi... - Get in. Ravi! - Sir! - Sir! - Sir. - Sir! I'm removing the gag. Please don't make any noise. Please stay quiet. You could have avoided the beating had you kept quiet. But madam... you stay quiet, and yet you get beaten up, right? What did you say? What do you know about me? I know everything, madam! I have seen women like you all my life. They are destined to lead such lives. After I got out of prison and saw my sister... I thought women had progressed. What about men? You, him... you are all the same. Madam, your husband and I are not the same! Of course you are. He hits, and you kill. You are both the same. You are correct, madam. You have a point. Not a day goes by when I don't regret my crimes. Fine, forget about me. Why are you putting up with him? Why don't you go on with your life... and leave him? Why do you care what I do with my life? Why are you so concerned? I am not. Then leave it. Oh, God! You have no right to say anything about me. He is making you clean the toilets. Clean the station. He thrashed you like an animal. What did you do about it? You hit him back... and your parole got canceled. Can you attend your sister's wedding now? My situation is similar too. I tried hard... but I failed. Correct. Correct. You are correct. You are absolutely right. Prabhu! All my life, I've not done one thing right. Prabhu, I'm sorry if my words hurt you. My sister... God had given me one last chance to see my sister's wedding. One last chance. But I ruined it with my temper... I won't give up. I must attend her wedding somehow. I will. Definitely. I will escape from here. If I manage to get away from here... I can attend my sister's wedding. That will be my ultimate revenge... against your husband. I will run away. I will escape from here. Madam... You won't tell your husband about this, right? Tell what? About my escape plan. Will you really escape? Yes. I will somehow escape from here and attend my sister's wedding. I will escape, madam. I definitely will. - Sir... - Sorry, madam. DIG sir just left. Ravi sir also left with him. How did you manage to remove the gag? Get up. Sir... Come. Sir. Prabhu... Yes, madam? Excuse me, sir. I have a plan. If it works... you will get what you want... and so will I. Prabhu, what are you doing? - Iqbal sir. - I'm fine. First catch him. Catch him... - Catch him. - Stop Prabhu, or we will lose our jobs. Catch him! Catch him... You can't catch him. What are you saying, Diwakar? Are you crazy? This is a bloody police station! He must be six foot and 80 kilos, right? How did he manage to get past all of you? If this news gets out, we will become a laughingstock! I don't care what you do, and how you do it... I want him back in custody by 6:00 p.m. Or I will skin all of you alive. What are you staring at? Get going. - Diwakar, come here. - Yes, sir? - Did you send the fax to the Prisons SP? - Yes, sir. - Then what are you still looking at? Move! - Okay, sir. Where the hell are you, Prabhu? Wow, my palace looks amazing. Superb! What's next? The whole town knows that he came to the police station. Now how can you say that he is missing now? What are you saying? Are you saying we beat him to death and dumped his body somewhere? He was the one who attacked us and escaped. Go and complain anywhere you like. Oh, yeah? We will show you what we are capable of. Bring as many people as you want. We'll see. Mister... Why are you giving him ideas? A plunging high tide Can't be contained Trying to restrict it with fences And boundaries is stupidity You thought you caged a pet cat But it turned out to be a tiger Where is Prabhu? - Where is Prabhu? - We need justice. We need justice. The shackles will break Time to unmask The light which breaks Out from darkness We have evidence to prove his entry into the station. But nothing to prove his escape. We are doomed. Inform us at once if Prabhu comes here. Don't underestimate a passive woman Ammu! The shackles will break Time to unmask Ammu! Coming! Ammu, open the door. What took you so long? Sorry, I was in the bathroom. You always have an excuse! Do you have any idea what I've been through today? How will you know sitting at home? Idiot! People suspect the police are behind the disappearance of... Prabhu Das, a double murderer, who went missing from the police station. Have the police taken the law into their hands? Where is Prabhu Das? Is he alive or dead? That is their doubt. Who will answer their questions? Will it be the police or the government? - Where is Prabhu? - Where is Prabhu? - We need answers! - We need answers! - Where is Prabhu? - Where is Prabhu? What do you want me to tell the media? I should never have trusted you with this. Now look what has happened! - Greetings, sir. - Greetings, sir. - All good? - Yes, sir. Your lunch is here. - Go ahead. I will wait. - Sorry, sir. - It's not like that, sir. - Go and have food. Take your time. - What are all of you doing? - Sir. A man is missing for four days. What are you doing here? Lunch... You don't have to come here from tomorrow. You don't have to bring me lunch anymore. Leave. - You are brainless! - Sorry, sir. - Sorry for what? - Sir. A man has gone missing from your custody. You people are wasting time here. Absolutely inefficient! You are useless. What do you think you people are doing here? We will find him no matter where he is. - Please leave now. - We won't, sir. We need our Prabhu. How can we... - Let them protest for two to three days. - Yes, sir. But in the meanwhile, try to catch that guy. Okay? And if he isn't found... - just suspend them. - Yes, sir. We will investigate the allegations against our department. If we don't catch Prabhu in three days, those involved will have to face the consequences. Ammu, everything is going as per your plan. Ravi will be suspended before Prabhu's sister's wedding. Oh woman Oh charioteer Her story... It's never ending NAME - V.PRABHU AGE - 32 The eyes which endure pain and loss The flooded eyes I have put on a few kilos, right? If the fiery heart gets inflamed Won't the strong wings Break the cage Her heart is an agitating ocean Every wave that rises could be disastrous A net wouldn't stop it A plunging high tide can't be contained We are past the DIG's deadline. We are doomed. This is your last chance. If he doesn't show up for his sister's wedding... even God can't save you. Please. Don't belittle a woman Why be a chauvinist? The shackles will break Time to unmask Prabhu... Has she forgiven me? Do you know something? Geetha wanted to call off the wedding for you. But everyone convinced her otherwise. Now the wedding is happening tomorrow at the protest site. In front of the police station. Imagine how happy she will be when she sees you tomorrow. What are you saying, Ammu? He will get caught if he attends her wedding. I know. What do you mean? I know. Are you nuts? You have come so far, and now you're going to throw it all away? It's unfair to ask him to stay here for my sake. This was my only promise to him. I must hon our it. I have decided. You will surrender yourself tomorrow. Go to prison after attending your sister's wedding. What will you do, Ammu? Sorry, madam. I know how badly you want to leave your husband. And yet, you let me go. You have a big heart. You deserve to be in a museum! My mother would never forgive me if I abandon you under these circumstances. What about Geetha's wedding? She has already forgiven me. That's all I have ever wanted. I'm very happy now. So you want to be the one making the sacrifice again? No! What you were willing to do for me is much greater than what I am doing for you. So, shall we book that spot in the museum for you? What say, madam? Superb! Don't ever stop smiling. Come on, madam. Let's get to business. - Prabhu... - Yes? I don't know what else to say, apart from "thanks." Stop saying thanks and sorry all the time! Let's get to work. Continue cooking. I'll go back to my palace. Let's meet for lunch. Puppetry show Life is an illusion Puppetry show Sir, he didn't turn up even for the wedding. What shall we do? Human mind sways like a swing A mind filled with chaos and confusion Life is not a bed of roses There are ebbs and flows Yet the dreams are the driving force The invisible threads Keep the play running The white screen unveils The colourful emotions Puppetry show Life is an illusion Come in. What is it? Sir, the DIG has told the ASP and the SP to start the investigation tomorrow. An FIR will be filed against us. Very simple. To survive this investigation... we should stick to the same story. Or else we are all doomed. If we don't find him by tonight... we must ensure that our stories match during the investigation tomorrow. You can leave. - Sir! - Sir. - Diwakar... - Sir? We need to delete the CCTV footage of us beating up Prabhu. Yes, sir. But it shouldn't look like we did it. It must appear to be an accident. Yes, sir! Last night, I sang after a really long time. Oh? It was your song. For that, and everything else you did for me, I've made you a "thank you lunch." You must come. Why bother? Give it to me, I'll eat it here. No. You have to come inside and eat with me. What's the occasion? Iqbal called me just now. He said my husband might get suspended tomorrow. I can put an end to this drama. Then you wouldn't have to stay here any longer. That's the reason behind it. I'll come. - Where is Prabhu? - Where is Prabhu? We have to maintain law and order. We have to clear them soon. - Just follow my orders. - Okay, sir. Release Prabhu immediately. Release Prabhu immediately. We need answers! We need answers! Join us. Who are these guys? Doesn't matter who they are. They are here to support us. RELEASE PRABHU IMMEDIATELY - Go. - Alright, sir. We want justice! - Shut the shop. - Move. - Move. - Close it. We can talk later. I want you to close now. - Where is Prabhu? - Where is Prabhu? Where is Prabhu? Release Prabhu! Release Prabhu. Something is fishy. Release Prabhu. Where is Prabhu? We need answers. Stop. Delete it. We need answers! Delete this one as well. Where is Prabhu? - We want justice! - We want justice! Release Prabhu! We want justice. Where is Prabhu? Release Prabhu! Stop! Rewind. Stop! Play. We want justice! Madam? Release Prabhu immediately. - Sir... - Where is Prabhu? We want justice! We want justice! Where is Prabhu? Release Prabhu immediately. Where is Prabhu? We want justice! Where is Prabhu? We want justice! Where is Prabhu? Release Prabhu immediately. Where is Prabhu? Sir, are you okay? Sir? Sir, is everything okay? What happened, sir? Iqbal sir, the inspector is here. - Iqbal... - Sir? Nothing! Sir? Hey! What were you singing just now? - Sir, I was just casually singing... - Sing it. - Sing it. - Sir... - I said, sing! - Sir. Puppetry show Life is an illusion Puppetry show Life is an illusion Puppetry show - Life... - Hey. Stop! How do you know this song? Sir, Prabhu used to sing this song all the time. Prabhu? He sang it at the station too, the other day. Why, sir? What happened, sir? - Iqbal... - Sir? Have we searched for Prabhu everywhere? We looked everywhere, sir. No. Sir! -Does this fish curry taste -Sir, this... As good as your mother's? - Hey. - Who is he? Who is he? Who are you people? - Who are you people? - Who sent you? Stop it. - Remember, we are here for Prabhu! - Stop it. Don't do this. Don't fight and ruin the matter. Uncle... Sai... Charge! Follow me. Where is he? Where is he? You bloody... Tell me, where is he? I heard his voice. I will break your head if you don't tell me where he is. I don't understand what you are talking about. Stop acting innocent. You think I don't know about you? Aren't you doing all this because I hit you? You are taking revenge on me by hiding him and making me lose my job. Did you think I wouldn't figure all of this out? Please trust me. I don't understand what you are saying. Please don't hurt me. There is a reason why I am pleading with you. You expect me not to hit you after everything you did? Why? - Why? - I'm pregnant. I'm pregnant. Ravi... Ravi... What? You are going to be a father. You shameless woman! How can you lie about it? Ravi, I'm pregnant. I was making sweets to surprise you. Ammu... Ravi... Call the doctor and check with her if you want. I really am pregnant, Ravi. Ammu is telling the truth. She is pregnant. She didn't tell you about this because she wanted to abort. But she called me today and said she wants to keep the baby. I know all about you, and I am warning you. At least now you can take good care of her. Ravi... I was scared. I wanted to abort the baby. But I couldn't. Because I know that it's your dream to have a baby. Now it's going to come true. I'm sorry I kept this from you. Ravi... Where is he? Where is he? I heard him! What happened? I'm unable to sleep. I'm just stepping out for a bit. Okay. Have some breakfast. No, I will eat outside. The dress you stitched for me last time... Linny, can you teach me how to make fish curry? Let it marinate well. Add the fish to it and... Come in. Does the fish curry taste as good as your mother's? Not as good as my mother's fish curry... but it's okay. Damn! What is it? Why? What happened? I'm recording this video because I fear I might get killed. My name is Prabhu. I've come out on parole to attend my sister's wedding. Unexpectedly, I got into a fight with Maharanipalli Inspector, Ravi. He took it personally... tortured me mercilessly and tried to cancel my parole and get me jailed. His wife saved me from him and sheltered me in their house without his knowledge... until my sister's wedding. Thanks to her, I got to watch my sister's wedding. Now I'm going to surrender myself at the DIG's office. If something were to happen to me in the mean time... Inspector Ravi is solely responsible for it. - Do you want some sugar? - No. You hid him right under my nose? You are smart. You cunning devil. Thank you. You can't do anything about it now. You can't arrest him. If you do... If I arrest him, I need to produce him to the DIG. He will ask me where Prabhu was hiding all these days. I have to admit that he was in my house. I will be suspended... and put in prison. That's your plan, right? Isn't that why he exaggerated things in the video and trapped me? So if he gets arrested or goes missing now, I will be in trouble. Well done! You are a bigger criminal than him. How can I not become one, having lived with you all this while? You're worse than I am! Now, I'm truly in love with you. I want to give you a passionate kiss... and smash your head against the wall... and as the blood drips slowly... I would love to watch you suffer. - But... - But? I admit, you win. Tell me what you want. What else is there to ask? Divorce. Of course. How can we live together after all this? Take it. Not just that... I need you to confess on video that you abuse me. Everybody should know your true colours. Stop joking. The worst that can happen to me because of Prabhu, is suspension. Whereas if I confess to the abuse... I will definitely be put behind bars. I will lose my job too. Do I look like an idiot? I'm giving you a divorce, right? Take it and be happy. Why do you need all this? Divorce takes time. In the meantime, you are capable of messing with me again. You could harm me once you are cleared of Prabhu's case. I can't take that risk. I can still do that. I can kill you and frame Prabhu for it. What do you say? Shall I do it? Would you kill me despite knowing I'm pregnant? Ammu... just because you are carrying my baby... you think I won't harm you? Don't you know me at all? I will sleep with another woman if I want a baby. That's not a big deal. Just tell me where Prabhu is. Was the sugar in your coffee enough? What are you blabbering? Have you gone mad? You should have taken the sugar when I offered it to you. You made a mistake. Hurry up! Ammu, you crossed a line here. I'm so furious... I'm not scared of you. If I were in your place... I wouldn't be wasting time now. Damn it! Why is this Prabhu issue going out of control? Ask Ravi to come and meet me immediately. Okay, sir. What's going on here? Get inside, sir. We will handle it. You think my brother would've come? No one must enter. Prabhu is here. Prabhu is here! Prabhu is here! - Hey... - Hey, Prabhu! - How are you? - How are you? - How are you? - I'm fine. Prabhu, I hope the police didn't trouble you. Forgive me, dear. I should be the one asking for forgiveness. Not you. Prabhu, come. - Don't worry, brother-in-law. - Where are you taking him, sir? Leave him, sir. - What's this, Uncle? - Prabhu! Stop staring. Just go! Get lost. Sir... - I need to meet the DIG. - You can't. Wait over there. - Keep an eye on him. - Okay, sir. Hey! You are making a big mistake. You are headed straight to prison. I can ensure you're life is hell and no one can stop me. Sir... do I look like someone who'll be scared of your taunts? Hey! Try to understand. Listen to me. Please maintain silence, sir. Sit over there, Ammu. Ammu, do you want to sit somewhere else? It's alright. He can't hurt me anymore. Ammu... listen to me. All my higher officials are here. Please leave. Don't do this to me. I beg you. Please! Sit. Sit. How many times have I begged you like this? Have you ever stopped? Ammu... I shouldn't have hit you. I'm sorry. Please leave from here. Please! Don't do this to me. Please. Please, Ammu. Try to understand. My whole life, and my career, will be completely ruined. Listen to me, Ammu. Please. Ammu... - How do I... - Where is that idiot Ravi? Sir! - Sorry, sir. - Wait. Ammu, why did you do all this? Sir, this is not the first time I've come to your office. The last time I was here... I thought he was the one who stopped me. But, no. I stopped myself. But not this time. I don't understand. Tell him, Ravi. Do you hit me? Tell the truth. Everyone is watching. Do you hit me? Yes or no? Madam... did you find it? Find what? A better word than thanks? To tell you the truth... I'm missing my palace a lot. Do you think... we'll ever meet again? Wait over there. So, what's next? This question always used to scare me. And that fear has always stopped me from doing what is right for me. But things have changed now. Here on, only good things will happen to you. What about the baby? Fine. Not wanting the baby won't make you a bad person. I know. I'm hungry, Linny. What shall we eat? Tell me. Do you know the hotel near the market? The one decorated with the flashy lights. I've always wanted to eat there. Shall we go there? Sure, let's go. Give me five minutes. Finally, you are leaving. I'm happy for you. How do you know? You are not shaking with fear anymore. You've become brave. Sit. That smells awesome. Eat up. If you knew I was wrong the other day, why didn't you tell me? Right or wrong... it has to be your decision. Got it? Wow! The biryani is delicious!
