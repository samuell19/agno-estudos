(intense music) (thunder rumbles) (wood creaking) (thunder rumbles) - Who's there? (foot steps) (intense music suddenly stops) - I didn't realize anyone was still left inside this house. I'm here to film the storm. It's getting pretty bad out there again. - Can you get me out of here? - Well, most of the back roads are completely flooded. My vehicle can handle it, So getting out of here won't be a problem. - Thank you. Thank you. I thought I was gonna die down here. - Wait, I know you. You're on TV. - Just occasionally. - Yeah. Yeah. You're on the think big channel. Your Dr. Carl, the storm guy. I love that show. - Storm chaser. - Right. Sorry. I just, I can't believe that I'm getting rescued By Dr. Carl, the storm chaser. - Is that what you think is gonna happen? (lightning cracks) - Dr. Carl? - You chose to ignore all the warnings. You chose to stay behind Even after being told to evacuate. Now you just expect to be rescued Because you realize you made a mistake. How utterly arrogant of you? - I mean I- - What is your name? - Anna. - Right, Anna. You will be a lesson to others When they are forced to choose Between their own narcissistic pride And the warnings of mother nature. After all, if that window were to break While you were standing underneath it, I mean, you could be seriously injured By heavy falling objects Or lacerated by glass. I mean, Anna, people, They need to know how dangerous these storms are. And you, You are gonna be another person Who's gonna share that with the masses. Right? - Yes. Oh my goodness, yes. I mean, I made a huge mistake staying behind But I'll never ever make that mistake ever again. - No. You won't. (intense music) (water running) - Hurricane season in full swing. And with Jonas currently wreaking havoc, Coastal residents are living in fear Wondering when the next big one Will hit the Brody peninsula. I'm here with local, Abby fields to see how she's preparing. Abby, how are you gearing up for this hurricane season? - Well, I'm good to go. The usual extra supplies, food, water, et cetera. But I won't start worrying until we hear otherwise. - [reporter] what about the mandatory evacuation? Would you leave? - Well, as a medical professional, My first priority is to my patients. So if I'm gonna keep them safe And that means evacuating, Then that's what we'll do. - The bulk of the storm is proceeding offshore. A category 2 of monster storm Is just waiting to move in and level this town. That lightning, it could split a tree in two Or turn a man to ash. And over the course of only a few minutes, Literally hundreds- - [voice on radio] the hurricane friction Has passed through the area And the search for survivors has began. The death toll crept up to 30 today And authorities are concerned it'll go higher. - Oh, it'll go higher. A lot higher. (phone vibrating) - Hey, hank. - [hank] Carl, my man. That storm footage is just killer. I love it. - Yeah, I'm glad you like it. But you know, It's a storm that's really doing the heavy lifting, hank. - It's great. This season is really shaping up to be one of the best. Now, get back here so I can get my hands on that footage. - Yeah, look, hank, I'm tracking the storm Off the Brody peninsula right now. - [hank] where's that? Never heard of it. Carl? You there? Carl? - It's remarkable. - [hank] remarkable? What's remarkable? - The storm cell is remarkable, hank. It's velocity, it's air pressure. - [hank] yeah, yeah, yeah, that sounds great. Get down there, give me more footage, you know- - Okay, I'm on it. The storm's coming at (indistinct) The storm is coming. (intense music) (intense music stops) (gentle music) (phone vibrating) (sighs) (inhales deeply) - Hey tony, what's up? No, the indomethacin is in the cabinet next to her bed. Yep. And don't forget, it's your turn to change report. Uh-huh. Uh-huh. Yeah. Oh, and remind me to talk to the doctor About glycerol levels in coma patients. Yeah, I've read an article about it, And I just want to see what he thinks. Yeah. Wait, last thing, I swear. Brush your hair. My mom always said, look good, feel good, So, who knows? Maybe Hannah will feel so good, she'll wake up. (soft music) (sharp exhale) - I specifically said that if she were to be read to, It should be something stimulating. We want her brain active. We want her to wake up. Were you aware of what tony here was reading my sister? Cut curbs and 50 other ways to blast your abs. - I just felt T. S. Elliot wasn'T giving us Enough workout tips. - There are dozens of studies that say, If you read a coma patient the wrong type of information, It can do irreparable damage. - This is a printout from natural healing data work. - From a doctor. - Chiropractor. - Ms. Banks, the passion you have for Hannah is commendable. Tony and I respect that. But you can't just come in here and yell at us like this. - I'm not yelling. I am simply airing my grievances. That's what I pay you for. - That's what you pay a therapist for. - You pay us to take good care of your sister, Day in and day out, And that's what we're doing. - Fine. But if you're going to read to her, Can you please make the material a little more engaging? I have a library full of classics. I think that's fair. Since I have you both here, I think now is a... - Now as we just reported, The national weather service Has issued a warning for all coastal counties That hurricane Carey has rapidly shifted course, - And will make landfall by 4:00 pm this evening. All residents are encouraged to find shelter, And all peninsula residents Are urged to evacuate to the main land immediately. - Hurricane Carey is projected to be a category 3, Causing massive destruction with a 300. (audio muted) - Fantastic. Exactly what we needed. How do we handle something like this? - Okay, hang on. Let me just, I'll call the hospital, I'll see if I can get us an ambulance, okay? - So, should I start prepping Hannah for a move? - And? - It was busy. Which means they're overwhelmed. They have hundreds of patients to evacuate. We are low on the list of priorities. - So we have to wait it out then. - Miss banks- - There is a generator out back, This house was built in the 1800s. It's had much worse. Come on. You know that I am right. It's the only thing that makes sense. Look, you're both welcome to leave, that's fine. But I'm staying with my sister. - I can't let you do- - You can't let me do what? - I can't let you do that alone. - Cool. Let's make a night of it. - Tony, if you hurry, you can still get to the mainland. - I don't have a car ab. And plus I doubt I can catch an uber right now. Peninsula's evacuating. And I think I'd be violating my Hippocratic oath If I left early. - Okay. Well, if you're sure that's what you want to do. I guess it would be good to have another nurse here. - I guess. (phone rings) Are you gonna get that, Or are we meant to delight in its incessant ringing? - Yeah, I should go check the generator. Yeah. - Is this your original crown molding? - We need to refuel. If the power goes- - Well, why is this empty? Why aren't you keeping an eye on this? - I'm not your housekeeper miss banks. You'll need to talk to your other help. - How long does Hannah's equipment have on battery? - 30 minutes. - Well, then we need to send someone to town. Now. (thunder rumbles) - Do you want me to explode? - Excuse me. - You're asking the guy that just got off a 14-hour shift, Who hasn't slept in probably 20 hours To drive into town, To pick up five gallons of unleaded fuel During the early stages of a category 3 hurricane. So I'm just gonna ask you again, Do you want me to explode? 'cause I'm definitely gonna crash one of your cars And you know, explode. - A simple, no, would have sufficed. - Okay. No. - He's right. I'll go. - If he's too tired to drive, He's too tired to take care of Hannah. - You can wake him up if something major happens. Tony, are you up for that? - Of course. - You should get some more supplies too if you're going out. You know, snack up. - Good idea. Just nothing frivolous. - Oh, s'mores. - Got it. - You can have carbs during a hurricane. (waves roaring) (thunder rumbling) - Please. Please be leaving. Let's hope you don't make the same mistake. - Well? - Well. - Well, we have preparations to make. - I just finished my shift, So I was hoping I can take a quick nap. - I'm thinking you can start with the batteries For the lanterns and the flashlight. And then I'm going to text Abby to see about shelf- - Take it easy. One thing at a time. - One thing at a time? There are a million things that need to be done Before this thing lands. - Oh my god do you need to relax. Hey, you're not gonna get anything done If you have yourself a heart attack. - I don't think you are grasping the severity of the- - Oh, oh. Deep breaths. (deep inhale) That was close. Look at me. Don't get lost in there. Deep breaths. You can do it. (deep inhale) (slow exhale) Yeah. Isn't that nice? See, now you're starting to act a little less like a robot. - You can start with Hannah's medical inventory. A log was off last week. - Miss banks, I didn't mean- - Just see to it. (dramatic music) (phone vibrating) - This is Redford. - Jack? - Abby. Hey. - Did I catch you at a bad time? Are you busy? - A missing person case. - Oh, I'm sorry to bother you. You're in the middle of something way more important. Just to call me back when you're- - Ab, it's fine. I've got a second. How are you? I'm just returning your call. - Right, of course. That storm is coming. It's gonna be a bad one And we're evacuating everyone we can off the coast. I just wanna make sure you're okay. Are you off peninsula yet? - I'm fine. - That didn't answer my question. Tell me you're evacuating. - Listen, I appreciate the concern, jack, really, but I'm- - So you're staying? - How can I leave? - You get in your car and you drive to safety. It's not rocket science. - It's not that simple. I'm sorry I can't just tell you what you want to hear. - I'm coming to you then. - Absolutely not. This is my job, jack. It's what I signed up for. - Why do you have to be so damn- - Headstrong? Yeah, I was about to say the exact same thing to you. I'll be fine. I don't need a white knight. - That's not what I'm trying to do. - Promise me you won't come. - There you are. - Huh? - Sorry, I just solved my missing person case. I've got to run. This the right one? Fantastic. Now, we had a deal. I find your dyno, And you joined your parents in the bus. You ready little lady? Come on. (gasps) - Sorry. Didn't mean to frighten you. - Almost gave me a heart attack. You can't just do that to people. - My apologies. You look like someone I knew. I wanted to help you with your groceries. - Well, I'm all done. But thanks. I know you. You're that guy from the think big channel. - Yeah. Yeah. Carl Highstrom. - Well, if they're sending Carl the storm chaser out, This must be a pretty bad one. - I've looked at the satellites And they call this a hundred year storm. Well, that would be under selling it. You're not staying, right? - Why does everybody seems so concerned about that today? I'll be fine, but thank you. - You looked... It's uncanny. You look just like someone I used to know. She's gone. She stayed behind in a storm just like this. You really should leave the peninsula, You know, set an sample. - I appreciate the advice But I've responsibilities, storm or not. - We all have responsibilities. But please, do your very best to not be here. I'd hate for something bad to happen to you. - Of course, he drives a creepy van. - Hospitals all over the region Are moving patients by the hundreds Off the peninsula before Carey makes landfall. Officials seem to be overwhelmed At the sudden change of course. And people are demanding answers as to why the state Was not better prepared for an emergency of this magnitude. - Need help? - I'm good, tony. Thanks for almost asking. - S'mores? - I got you chocolate, graham crackers and marshmallows. You can make your own. - Oh, too much work. - You good? Ms. Banks. - This was our parents' house. I wanted to sell it, make some money, reinvest. What was I gonna do with all this space? But Hannah, She thought our families could vacation here one day. She was always so much more optimistic than me. - Is. - Excuse me. - She is more optimistic than you. She's not gone. Plus her doctor said she's likely to wake up anytime. - You don't really believe that, do you? - You don't? All of her doctors seem really hopeful. - Hopeful? There's been no change. She just feels further away than ever. - You want to hear something silly? Every morning before work, I say a little prayer, I'll walk in here and find Hannah cooking breakfast. - If my sister wakes up an ab blaster over there Lets her make her own breakfast, You'll have a new coma patient. (chuckles) - Got it. - So it begins. (dramatic music) (rain pounding) - Dammit Abby. - Bridge is shut down. Oh, hey. You're a little out of your jurisdiction, aren't you man? - Yeah, my... An old friend of mine is stuck there Looking after her patient And I don't want her to be alone. - I can't let you through. Bridge is officially closed now. Sorry man. - Listen, I can really use the favor here. I'm worried about her. - There's no other way to get on the peninsula. And don't even try to go three miles in that direction Down the road And over the old railroad bridge. It's big enough for a car to get over And there's no cop in front of it, But it's illegal and a little stupid. Got it? - Thanks man. And one more thing. - What? - You got anyone still on the peninsula? Can you call it in. Check on the banks' house over on Vaughn street. - I better be getting a Christmas card for this, This year. - If you're ever in Hooperton, look me up. I'll buy. Dispatch? Need a wellness check on "banks", 109 Vaughn street. (indistinct voice on the radio) Hope she's worth it pal. (waves roaring) (wind blowing) (thunder rumbling) - Meanwhile on the Brody peninsula, Winds are beginning to register at 100 miles per hour, Threatening to cause significant amounts of damage. And while surfers in the quince cove area- - Looks like you mastered the strength. (gentle music) Tony's asleep. So I got an extra s'more if you want it. - Thanks. You're getting a raise for the Armageddon snacks. - Well, technically tony made this one, so- - I take it back then. - Oh, okay. Well, I'll just go bury this one in the backyard And then make you a fresh one then, okay? Hey, there's a smile. See, I told him you were human. - I used to smile all the time. I used to be fun. Even more shocking, I used to be laid back. Kinda. That was before everything. - I'm sorry miss banks. I didn't mean anything by it. - It's fine. You know I'm not normally someone Who second guesses herself, But I'm starting to wonder if we should have tried harder To leave. - It's okay. We're gonna be okay. (lightning cracks) - This is where the storm will begin it's rampage. This is where the storm will begin its rampage. Two, one. This is where the storm will begin its rampage, Off the Brody peninsula. It will ravage everything in it's wake. Monuments, places of worship, people's homes. This atmospheric phenomenon does not discriminate. It will breach their homes like an angry god. An angry god. Like an angry god, searching for sacrifices. The ultimate question then. The ultimate question then being. The ultimate question then being, Will they know the storm is upon them before it's too late? Unfortunately, many of these older coastal towns Tend to be in the same power grid. So if the storm chooses to knock out one, Well, there goes the neighborhood. When will they learn? - Why are we doing this in the basement Surrounded by all the Halloween decorations? And by lantern? The power is still on. - Because candlelight in the storm is romantic. - Honey, that's not a candle. Also won't be romantic if the roof rips off. - The roof isn't going anywhere. The house is more than fine. They used to really know how to make them. - You know there's a puddle in the middle of the room, Right? - You want me to turn on the sump pump? - That wire looks super sketchy. I'd rather not die by electrocution. - It's for the generator if the power goes out. Totally safe. - I can't believe you talked me into staying. I must be crazy. - Crazy enough to have said, I do. You're a Barrett now. - I still feel weird to hear that. - My family has been on this peninsula, Rain or shine for 120 years. I'm not about to mess with perfection now. - Oh, is that what it's called? Perfection. - Well, let me make it better for you. (squeaking sound) - Did you hear that? - Yeah, it was probably just a squirrel or something Trying to stay dry. (loud bang) - That's a pretty big squirrel. - Maybe some muskrat. I'll go check it out. (wind howling) Just in case he's a mean muskrat. Hello? Anyone there? Not that you would answer. (thunder rumbles) (foot steps) (lightning cracks) (screaming) (Carl shushes Helen) - I don't like there to be screaming until the end. Is this your boyfriend? Husband. Yeah. I see. I had a wife once. She's gone now. Stupid people. You think this is fun? Staying behind in a storm. It's what? Romantic? - Sir, please don't do this. Please. - It's already done. I didn't do anything. The winds, the rain, they did it. You stayed behind and nature took its course. Don't you see? I'm nature. I'm the storm. - Please. Please. Please. - I'll give you this though. You cried a lot less than your husband did. (bat thumping) - So many machines working to keep her alive. - Doing a great job of it. Remember walking around, making breakfast anytime, right? (Ella gasps) It's okay. She won't feel anything. (Ella gasps) Are you okay? - I'm fine. - You're afraid of needles. - No, I'm not afraid. I just don't like them. Get on with it. - Okay. - See, perfectly fine. - The eye of the storm hasn't even come to shore yet, And already the winds are strong enough To rain down shards of broken trees like ancient spears. But this isn't some Greek soldier throwing a lance, No, it's mother nature herself. And her strength is such That she can shatter your ribs Or pierce right through your torso In a matter of seconds. (rain pounding) - You'll probably yell at me anyways. - You okay? - I was doing so much better with them. And now here I am hiding in my room, shaking like a leaf. - Well, if it makes you feel any better, I used to date a cop twice your size. Every time he'd give blood, he'd go out like a light. - Sounds like he should've stopped giving blood then. - I said the same thing. He said he would. He said he would when people stopped needing it. - You should've seen me When Hannah was still in the hospital. Nurse would come in with a syringe, And I'd wake up on the floor looking up at her. - Probably you should've have just left When you heard them come in. - I couldn't leave. Not then, not in the beginning. I just kept thinking, Any minute now she's gonna wake up. And I had to be there when she did. - You're a good sister. - Doesn't always feel that way. I know I'm not the easiest person to get along with. - No, you're- - You don't need to be polite. Let's just say, difficult. - In a good way. - That's sweet. It's just, this house and Hannah, There all that I have. After the accident, my boyfriend left. And our parents are gone, So I've just been here alone, waiting for a miracle. So if it seems like I don't appreciate you. I do. I'm really glad you're Hannah's nurse. I might fire tony next week though. (both chuckle) - There it is. (door bell rings) - Can we help you, officer? - I guess you folks didn't hear about the evacuation. - No we heard, but- - My sister is in a coma And can't be moved with anything less Than a full medivac by air. If you're offering one, We'll be more than happy to take it. Until that time, I urge that you watch your tone. - Well, someone asked me to come here and check on you. And now that I have, And I see that you are just super pleasant, I guess I'll be on my way. - Great. Goodbye. - Officer, just out of curiosity, Who asked you to check in on us? - Some cop from the mainland. I don't know his name, but when I find out who it was, I'll be sure to let them know just how happy I was To drive all this way. - Sorry. Thanks for coming, officer. - Greek soldier throwing a lancet. It's mother nature herself. Or should it be itself? No. Herself. Yeah. Oh gosh. Oh, I don't know. I'm feeling like maybe I should shoot that last commentary Again. What do you think? What? No opinion? It's a pity. - Hello? Hello? Dispatch, I'm gonna need you to send... (thunder cracks) This is the police. If you're down there, say something. Drop what you're holding, hands on your head. - There's a window, right? Hadn't broken the window yet. And that's how you knew that something was wrong. It's clever. You would have gone far. - Stay where you are. - Look, I have to say, I really do respect first responders, I do. Yet, I'm surprised that you took a risk Of coming out here in this storm Without rubber sole shoes on. I mean that's very dangerous. You should have known better. I mean, sure, it's gonna be an odd looking scene, But I'm sure they'll piece it together. - This is your last chance. Drop it. - Okay, officer. If you say so. (electric shock) - It's okay. That's what the generator's for. Just give it a second. Three, two, one. (generator roars) It worked. I'll have to refill it soon. Which means going back out in the storm. - Sounds like a job for tony when he gets up. (dial tone) (phone vibrating) - Hey. - I believe you sent someone to check up on us. I told you I had it covered. You really didn't need to do that. - Doing well. Thanks for asking. My knee is acting up a bit and mild swelling, But otherwise- - This isn't a time to joke, jack. Listen, I appreciate the concern, But I need to know that you are not coming out here. - What are you so mad about? Of course I'm concerned. I'm a cop. I did what I do. - I can't help but feel like you're using the storm As an excuse. I thought we both agreed that it would be better If it was a clean break. - One, you said that, not me. And two, just because you care more about your job Than you do me, Doesn't mean I stopped caring about you. - Don't act all sanctimonious with me, okay. That's a two way street. You can't have two people more dedicated to their jobs Than each other. - Okay. Well, maybe you're wrong what I care about most, ab. - Tell me, where are you right now? - Emotionally, pretty lost. - Physically. - Oh, that. Pretty lost. - You're impossible. You better not be coming out here, okay? It's not worth putting yourself in danger. - I think I'm the one who gets to decide that. - Not everyone needs to be saved, jack. - Yeah? Tell that to everyone you and I have saved. (lightning cracks) (phone beeping) Well, that went great. (car ignition goes silent) Come on. - Abby? - Sorry about that. - Was that the blood donor? - Yeah. - Come on. (car ignition rattling) - He sent the cop to check in on us, And he won't tell me where he is. So part of me is worried he's coming out here too. - Sounds monstrous. All that caring. - Yeah, he's a pretty great guy. - And the problem is? My ex said the thing that drew him to me was my ambition. And then when that drive got transferred over to Hannah, He lost interest. You and her can be a pretty nasty thing, huh? - Yeah. I just wish mine would stop crawling onto my sleeve. - Life is too short. I don't care about the fights we had over this stupid house Or that she got mad I drank out of the milk carton. I know for a fact I'll regret every moment I didn't spend with her, Every time I put work first, Every... Do you know why I hired you? - My skills with the needle? - You're the only person who asked what Hannah's name was. It showed that you cared, just immediately. So maybe there's something To that heart being on your sleeve. I wish I could show it more. Most people assume that I'm cold. I'm not. I just have trouble- - Showing it? - Yeah. Yeah. I wish I would have shown it a bit more today. You are the most capable nurse I've ever met. It's incredible watching you care for Hannah. And you never once threw an iv bag at me, Even though I am sure you have wanted to. If you can show that to me, Then I don't see why you can't with... - Jack. - Listen, I am gonna try and get some rest. You have some time, right? Before I hand this next shot? - Yeah, until nine. - Okay. Then I don't think it'd be a total dereliction of duty To have a little drink. I'm pretty sure there's an absolutely no drinking section On like page seven of my contract. - And I'm pretty sure staying overnight during a hurricane Is not mentioned once. (Abby chuckles) - Perhaps I'll rewrite that thing in the morning. - Thank you for the talk and- - Just don't wake the boss up. She can be kind of cranky. (sighs) - I'll save you for later. (lightning cracks) (sharp exhale) - If you woke up right now, Hannah, Would you think we're all nuts for staying behind? I'll be right back. (rain pounding) - (indistinct) - Is this why you stayed stayed behind? That's very touching. (lightning cracks) - Come on ab, keep it together. - They should have had a plan to get you out of here. How very irresponsible of them. But you will be the easiest one. The kind of people who wouldn't find a way To get you out of here Are the same kind, sloppy people, Who don't do the little things. Aren't they? (lightning cracks) (thunder rumbling) (lightning cracks) She'll have to wait. You'll do for now. (thunder rumbling) - There a leak? - [tony] Abby? - Evening sunshine. - We didn't die. So, I'll get a cup of coffee and then start my shift. - It's okay. I'm good to stay on a little while longer. - Okay. Anything I can do in the meantime? - Yes, actually. Can you refill the generator? It got low. I got more gas, But the can is still in the garage. - No time like the present, I guess. - Thanks tony. - Yep. - Appreciate it. Did you go outside already? - Huh? I don't know. Maybe it's a leak or something. Ab, it's a crazy big storm, okay? Maybe it's the wind. - Did you hear that? - What? - Just go fill the generator and come right back, okay? - Yeah. Hey, hey, you okay? - Yeah, I'm fine, I just, I don't know. Something feels off. Maybe the storm's just getting to me. - Yeah. - Just be quick. You don't get to be struck by lightning Or drowned in a puddle. - Okay, I'll do my best, okay? - Okay. Go. Hurry. - Too close. There's too many of them. Not yet, not yet, not yet. Why? Why did you stay behind? God, you're smarter than this. How could you do this to me? How? Help. The eye. - Can I help you? Wait, I know you, don't I? (machine beeping) - Hannah. - Tv or something. You're like a preacher or an infomercial guy or something? - Storm chaser. - All right, awesome. Fernando, right? - Carl. (machine beeping) - What's going on? - I don't know. She's just crashing. - Are you here for the storm, Carl? - Actually, I want someone to help me film. - What do you mean, why? - I don't know. - What do you mean you don't know? - Miss banks, I'm gonna need you to help or get out. Do you understand me? - Yes. - Good. Do you know CPR? - I really gotta get inside. - No, no, no, come on. It's just gonna take a moment of your time. And then you can tell your friends That you are a storm survivor With Carl Highstrom. - Tony, he's just- - No time. Do you know CPR? - Yes. - Good. Start. (intense dramatic music) - One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight. - I've never used a camera like this. - No, no, no, it's simple. Look, just point at me and hit that little red button, okay? That's it. Easy peasy. - I don't know about this, man. I really got to get inside. - It's just gonna take a minute. Maybe two. Come on. We'll go out, we'll shoot a take. Yeah? What do you say? - All right. - Awesome. All right. - On the count of one, two, three. Right there. - What the... - It's the eye. It's gonna give us a couple of moments of silence, Which is what we wanted. Okay, let's do this. Camera on me. Red button. Okay. And, action. - Oh god. - What? What is it? - Her iv has been detached. - What? - It's fine. We'll worry about that later. I'm gonna need you to take this needle. - No, I can't do that. - You can do this. - No, Abby. - For your sister. - Okay. Okay. Okay. - Just tell me what I need to do. - When I say, exactly when I say, I'm gonna need you to inject her. - Do I need to hit a vein? - You can. But I'm not asking for miracles here. Just get it in her. - I stand here in a moment of calm In an otherwise devastating storm. Which is a metaphor of what I have gone through In my own life. Moments of pause in between - Now - Raging storms. Earlier this evening, I too paused just like the storm. Unsure of whether I should continue with my mission. - It's not working. - It'll work. - Or float off the night like a wayward cloud. - Are you okay? Carl? Dude? Are you okay? - Yeah. Yeah. Keep on, please. Some storms dissipate into the air. And then there's others that rage uncontrollably Until all of their energy is spent. Tonight is one of those storms. Cut. Yeah. - That was intense. - Yeah? Too much? - Yeah. This isn't Shakespeare, it's a storm. You gonna creep people out. All right, I'm gonna head inside. Killer death storm and all. - I don't think you're gonna have to worry about that. - Really? Is it over? - Well here, let me show you. Take a look at the scene on the camera. - All right. (Carl tsking) - You know it actually happens more often than you think. Someone was out in the storm. They slip, they fall, get knocked unconscious And end end up drowning in a pond. It is a pitiful way to die But it's believable. Right on time. - Come on. (Ella sobs) - I think we're in the clear. Are you okay? - Why was the iv detached, Abby? - Miss banks. - You were the last person in this room. - Miss banks. - You made a mistake that could have killed my sister. - Ella! I think there's someone else in the house with us. - What? Tony is- - No, I mean someone else. The backdoor looked like it had been broken into, And there are wet footprints all over the house. The rug next to your bed was soaking wet. I make mistakes, I'm not perfect, But I am positive that iv was secure when we left. We are not alone. (lightning cracks) - Why did the power go? - Tony, I sent him to refuel. We've 30 minutes to get the generator back up and running. Otherwise Hannah's equipment will stop and she will die. - Okay. Okay, what do I do? - I need you to stay here, Lock the door I'm gonna go outside, Find tony and get the generator back up and running. Once that's done, I'll come back to help you. 29 minutes. - Go. (upbeat music) During the bowl of a dull, dark and (indistinct) day In the autumn of that year, When the clouds hung oppressively low in the heavens. - Tony? (thunder rumbles) Tony? Here we go. (rain drops pounding heavily) Tony! (melancholic music) (wood crackles) - Abby? (door knob clanking) Whoever you are, get out of my house. - Hey, ab. Are you okay? - Jack? - There's a body on the front lawn. - Thank god you (screams). - Why did you stay? Why? We should probably talk this out, you and me. I'm not the villain here, ab. That is what he calls you, right? Ab? That's cute. That's cute. I used to call my wife, beaches. Her name's Sandra. Sandy, sandy beaches. Beaches. It was cute. Just like you two. She died, you know, in a storm, Just like this one. You want to know what happened? I was working out of town, I got a call from a friend of mine, Works for the weather service. And he said, beaches, Sandra, who's home alone, She's gonna get hit by a storm. A big one. Worse than this one even. Oh, I was worried, of course, and I called her, And I said, "honey, you gotta get out of there." She told me she would, So I was relieved. And the next day in the afternoon When I was at the airport waiting to go home, I get the call. She died. She stayed and she died. She was with a neighbor. Do you understand me, ab? She was with a neighbor, A man, In my house, In my bed. In my bed. She stayed because she wanted to be with him. But I realized, after every one of these storms, These disasters, There's always a tragic story About the people who stayed behind, Even for good reasons. And there's the others, you know, like my wife, Who wants to think that it's okay to stay behind. They're not gonna die. That they're stronger than the storm. Nobody ever questions the blunt force trauma, The suffocation, The electrocution. No, they just attribute it to the storm. Never to me. Do you know what I think, ab? I think that everybody deep down subconsciously, They agree with me, yeah. 'cause nobody investigates too hard, no. Because they know, They know that people who stay behind deserve to die. They know that the storm has to kill them. You understand, ab? The storm has to kill. Oh! (upbeat music) (generator roars) - Yes. (watch beeping) Oh, god. Please be okay, please be okay. Oh, god. - Now who's the white knight? - Okay, come on. (jack groans in pain) - Sorry. Could have been here sooner But my car flooded. - Never been happier to see you. Does your radio still work? - No idea. (jack groans) - Okay, come on. - What is going on? Oh, he hit me. - I need your hand. (jack groans in pain) - Listen, I just wanted to say... - No! (Carl groaning) (upbeat intense music) - Stop! Don't you move. - How are you gonna make this look natural? Or are you gonna blame this on the storm? Bullets don't fly through hurricanes, Carl. I thought about that. How's this? The bullheaded cop ex, He can't handle the pain of the woman that he loves Not being with him. So, in a jealous rage, he drives to where she works And he murders her young lover and everyone in the house Before committing suicide. Of course the people in the house, they fight back, But he overcomes them all. (sarcastic laugh) Yeah? - Only one problem. - What's that? - I called the police five minutes ago, Carl. (Carl screams) - I said, get out of my house! You okay? - Tony's dead. - What? - [Carl] you're not safe in there. - He's not gonna stop. Police will be here any minute, just leave! (Carl laughs hysterically) - You think yelling at the storm scares it? Do you? You can't stop the wrath of nature. - This is it. - Is he walking away? - Hannah. No, Ella, wait! - We've done this dance before, you and I. This time I'll be sure to squeeze up tighter. Stop! I squeeze, and I will separate the skull from the vertebrae. - What do you want? - Want? What do I want? I don't want anything. It's the storm. The storm wants you dead. - Is this is what your wife would have wanted? - What're you doing? Don't you talk about my wife. Don't do talk about my wife! Don't! - Doing this won't bring her back. - You don't think that I know that? Huh? That's not the point. The point is to set an example. To show people, So that this never ever happens again. You see, I'm the good guy here. - Carl! Carl! - You look so much like her. I hoped you were smarter than her though. But you weren't. And you had to stay behind. - For her. We stayed for her. I know I should have left, But then I'd be the coward that left everyone in harms way. I knew dangers, but I did it anyway. I'm the good guy, Carl. - No! No! I... I... No! No! No! No! You should have had a plan. Everything that's happened is your fault. Now you all have to die. - The storm is over. - I was driving home And then I was having the most awful nightmare. There was a man whose... He was talking to me. I could hear him talking to me. And then I woke up and he was trying to hurt you, So I had to save you. What's going on? - We have a lot to talk about. - No! - Freeze! - Jack. - Ab, cuff this son of a bitch. (chuckles) (gentle music) - [paramedic] got two over here. - Hey, what else do you want on these? Whipped cream, syrup, butter? - How about all of it. Here, let me help you. - No, no, no, no. You stay put. - This looks so good. - Thank you. Great. Okay. Go. - Ella, thank you, But I think I can do it. - What else do you want? How about a muffin? - How about you relax, And just enjoy this breakfast with me. - These look pretty good. You did a good job. - You did a great job. - I'm not really much of a cook. - I know. (both laugh) - I'm sorry, jack. I'm sorry for everything. I don't wanna be away from you anymore. There is room in my life for all of the things I love. - I'm sorry too. I love you, Abby. - I love you too. - Oh! - Oops! Sorry, did I hurt you? - Worth it. Where do you think you're going? - With you. I'm going with you. - We both know where you need to be. - But I can- - Ab, we'll have plenty of time together later At the hospital. - Go see your patients. Bring me some burgers when you come visit me. - Okay. (jack groans) - Hi, do you want some breakfast? - Told you. (police siren) - I know you. - I'm sure you do. - You're on that think big channel, right? - Yep. Storm chaser. - Man, I watch you all the time. That's crazy. Hey, Nic, you know that dork on the think big channel. He's handcuffed back here. - Who? - This storm chaser guy. He's always running into 'em like a moron. - That's cool. - Crazy. - [voice on radio] you've been listening To the KJWS with Jeff Jaime. Now let's go to (indistinct) for our weather update. - [woman voice on radio] residents will only have mere weeks To assess the damage done by hurricane Carey before another- - Hey, could you turn that up a little? - [woman voice on radio] chance of severe thunderstorms Tonight with the possibility of tornadoes. Citizens are asked to take shelter to avoid- - That's it, sir. I just needed the weather. (upbeat music) (gentle music)
