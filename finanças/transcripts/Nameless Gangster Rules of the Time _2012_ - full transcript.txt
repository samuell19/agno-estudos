He's not the only gangster in town, and I'm to blame for getting in bed with you. Shit, putting me in an awkward position... Why did he do it? We've known each other for a long time, but I didn't realize how big a criminal he was. Say hello. This is prosecutor Jo. - Mr. Prosecutor. - Petty gangster. Answer me with yes or no to my questions. Got that? Yes. - Can you write? - Yes. In clean, legible letters. Mr. Prosecutor, Do I look like a violent gangster? I was a civil servant, a respectable one at that. - Open it. - Yes, sir. Huh? For what? What are you doing? Civil servant? Motherfucker! If you forget something I know about, or lie in your confession even in the slightest, I'll leave the rest to your imagination. Done. March 1982, Busan Customs Office Ah, here he is. Thanks for coming. What is all this? This is fish food? I know the world is a better place, but fish eats ginseng now? Let's go inside. Please, wait a moment. Actually, supervisor Park in management is my family. I'll look the other way since you're family with Park, Do you know how hard that is? Just the four of us, all this... We're done, let's go. One moment. This isn't much, but have a drink on me. Please don't do this, you really don't need to do this. We're all family here. Keep it down. How could you do this to another civil officer?! - What's going on? - Let's stay out of it. What's going on outside? We're fucked. That woman reported to the prosecution, it's blowing up. What's that? It's nothing. Drop one notch, will you? - Good bye, sir. - See you tomorrow. Get inside. Take it easy... Okay, hold still. Careful... Why is this so big?! Be quiet! Keep it down! Pack it up. Thank you. Yes, sir. We'll go from there. We may look like we don't have much. But us, Choi family from Gyeong-ju, is a very noble family. Even today, many successful people, from prosecutors, judges to generals, Yes, I've heard many stories. Let's see... Here, take this. Mortgage a house with it and... Where is it... And this is wedding gift. Go on, take it! Okay, thank you. How did I ever live without a brother... Took years to save that money... Kids, say hello, this is your new uncle. - Hello. - Hi there. You watch, he'll become something! What do we do? Just be quiet. Yeah, it's done. Alright. Let's drink first. Ik-hyun, as you may have heard, one of us from Inspection Department should receive the noose as well. For everyone's sake, I wish I could do it myself, but I'm the chief, it may cause problems upstairs by doing so... So I thought we'd choose by least amount of family members. What do you think? I got 3 sons and 2 daughters. 4 daughters and a son. I got 2 daughters and a son. Then you can count in my grand folks, 3 brothers too, like 10 people! Let's just drink for now. - Let's drink. - Yeah, drink! So you gotta be coy about it. I heard his surgery bill's astronomical. Make sure it's enough to stuff his fat ass with it. 5 grand to get appointed, another 5 for the transfer, now what? Fuck, was I the only one who took bribes? Hurry, hurry, let's go! Let's go, now. What are you doing? What are you doing? You shit! What the, son of a bitch! You fucking bitch! Stop, you shit! Just step on it, go! Stop fucking right now! Who the fuck were they? Open it. This is fucking nuts... Those bastards. Mr. Jang, seriously! We have to do this. Seriously? What's so wrong about selling some dope to the Japs? I mean, really. I wish they'd all die, frankly. We've to rise above Japan somehow, right? Am I right? I agree with you. Then how about... Ah, really? No, no, no. This really is a bad idea... Come. It's been a while. Don't worry. Pleasure to meet you, I'm Choi Ik-hyun. I am Choi Hyung-bae. Yes, sir. Alright, let's talk business. Mr. Choi. From what I can tell, this is a stolen property, how would you deal with backlash? Let's do it this way. I'll be responsible for everything, $3,000 per kilo, it's half of street value. What do you think? Okay, it's a deal. By the way, Mr. Hyung-bae! Look at me, shouldn't have called you that. I'm sorry, really. I don't know what to call you. Whatever's easy for you. Oh, then, just Hyung-bae? Ah, sure, Mr. Choi! Excuse me for asking... but which Choi are you? And clan? Choong-ryul clan. I knew it. I knew Hyung-bae belonged to our family! Gyeong-ju Choi, Choong-ryul clan, 39th generation! Yes. Look! I'm like your great great grandfather! Ik-hyun, you drank too much. Enough of this. I knew this would happen. Same physique too. What's your father's name? Moo-il, Choi Moo-il? Did he ride the tuna boat until a few years ago? I got you! You little prick! I know your father all too well! Go on, take a bow! Take a bow! What's with you! What're you doing! Hey. Stop it! Please, no more! Enough. Stop it. Hey mister, why are you talking shit during business? Shouldn't you come right away when I call? He's a prominent man, who's very well connected, you hear me? Got it? Yes. Go take a bow! No, don't worry. That's it. Good. Why don't you check? I'm sure everything's there. And I sincerely apologize for the other day. No worries. It's okay! No need to get worked up. It happens. Would you join me for a dinner? The deal worked out and all. - Shall we go then? - Alright. Only dinner though? Ah, Chang-woo! This is my deputy. If you have anything to take care of, feel free to call him. Take a bow. Ah right, we met the other day, didn't we? If you're not busy, come eat with us. Sure, come. - Good night, boss! - Take care, boss! Hyung-bae, when I first saw you, don't take this the wrong way, it was like falling in love with a woman at first sight. It was that feeling. You are too. Hyung-bae. I see you taking those pills, what are they for? Are you sick? It's just painkillers. Got hurt in a fight? It's not that. I was sent to the Samchung Prison Camp. It got messed up by fucking MPs there. You went through a lot, haven't you? Hyung-bae, you don't need to worry about anything any more. I'm here for you now. In the palm of my hand. Ah, Chang-woo! You can really sing! Beautiful voice! Do you practice at home? Let's see. Have some pocket money! Thank you very much. Chang-woo, let's go pay our water bills. Manager Choi! What the... Ah, chief Jo. I could ask you the same. This is someone I worked with, didn't I tell you about a funny colleague the other day? Ah, is this him? How do you do, I'm Choi Ik-hyun. So nice to meet you all. Thank you. - What an interesting fella. - Let's all raise our drinks! Cheers! Gents, please take good care of the chief. He may not be the prettiest, but depth of his compassion is... huge. Like his dick. Go away quietly if you had your drink. I better do what I'm told. I'll be on my way then. Leaving? Buy him nice meals, and get his rocks off too, he likes that. What's this asshole yapping on about! You fucking shit! Don't fucking hit me, asshole! I'll kill you! Who the fuck are you? You son of a bitch! You son of a bitch! Am I still your bitch?! Whatcha looking at, you fucks! There's no business quite like it. You're saying it's good money with some muscle and bribes, right? Alright! Let's do it! Koreans go nuts over gambling, ain't it? What a fucking day! Hyung-bae. Hot-blooded men like me should be in the military! Life's fucked! Fucked!! Careful, it's hot. It's fresh. Sweetie, you're embarrassing me... Very fresh. October 14, 19.90, Busan Prosecutor's Office First of all, I'll start with a brief on Choi's arrest. On May 5th, 1990, 2PM, Busan hotelier Hur Sam-sik was kidnapped without reason and provocation. Hur then accused Choi as the perpetrator, against Choi lk-hyun for ordering the assault. Reporter Kim has that story. We have 3 undercover men there. Mr. Choi. How are you holding up? Let me make one call. Well... It's Choi Ik-hyun. Prosecutor Jo, come say hello. Good afternoon, I am Jo Bum-suk. Prosecutor Jo, I know Choi well because he's a Kyung-joo Choi too, and it's true that he's acquainted with some gangs. But your reasoning is that if you know a gangster, you're automatically guilty by association. Then how could you investigate this inadequately? Choi Ik-hyun was a civil official, an appointed figure. Do you know Choi Hyung-bae? Yes, the gang boss. That man is Choi Ik-hyun's relative. Did you know that? Is that so? That's what I thought... How do you investigate without such vital info? Let's say Choi Ik-hyun is a gangster, This is what I'm trying to tell you. I too investigated gangs in my days. My apologies, sir. From what I'm hearing, I think Jo made some grave errors. We'll investigate according to the protocol. Shall we go for lunch? So you're saying you have no ties to Kim Pan-ho, right? Yes, that's what I'm saying. And you had no part in assaulting and threatening Hur. Don't change your story later. Fine, go home for now. But let's get one thing straight. If there is slightest contradiction in your story during my investigation, I'll come after you with everything I got, no one will be able to protect you. Go. April 1.985, Busan - Bring me something cold. - Yes, sir. TWO! What are you doing here? You haven't heard, Mr. Hur. Why did you leave such stable job? People tend to look for vocations that's just right for them. If you got some good business ideas, be sure to let me in on it. Certainly! Good afternoon, boss. Ah, yeah. - Go on now. - Yes, boss. You know, they do some chores for me now and then. Sure thing. This is fresh! By the way, Mr. Choi, this may be inappropriate for me to ask you, but do you know any gangsters? That's what I'm saying. See that guy with mustache? They're the ones I've been telling you. As you can see, this place is doing very well, but at the end of the month, they take out various bullshit expenses, so there's no profit, and I'm putting more money in for maintenance. You're such a fool. And you didn't do anything about it? What am I supposed to do then? I think they partnered up with her and siphon the profit. What's your share? 24%. Here he comes. That's Kim Pan-ho, the chief manager. That deputy works for him. From what I hear, he's one of the top gangsters in Busan. We're really tight. Pan-ho was one of us. We're the same age as well. Even though he's not with us now, we rose together in the same family. You can't beat him? Daebu, that's not it. Justification is the problem. There are rules even in the gangster world. I can kick his ass no problem though. Yeah? Excuse me for a moment. Ms. K0, you became more beautiful. Leaving already? Is that so? My gosh, you shouldn't do that! Those pigs ate so much. Sir, you're much too busy. She's the one who took care of the licensing problem you had. Is that right? Hyung-bae. you mentioned justification earlier. You and I are family. Is there more important justification than that? Tell me if I'm wrong about this, am I? What, you're not up for it? Sir, I don't know what you take me for, but I'm an upstanding martial artist! Listen to yourself, just listen. Would you let your child live like you? At the very least, your child should live proudly. Crazy bastard. Welcome. Good afternoon. - It's this room. - Right here? Been a while. You got here early. Please sit down. I'm Choi Ik-hyun, your new partner. Mr. Hur told me a lot about you. You're more beautiful than what I've heard. Fine, let me introduce you, this is the chief manager Kim Pan-ho. Nice to meet you. I heard the gist of it, why did you make us come all the way down here for? What a pretty mouth on that pretty face. Alright. Let me get down to the business. How could you run a legit business this way? Secondly, in order to prevent further complications, I want to place one of my men here. Who? This fella right here. What the fuck! You've been around much? Calm down and sit down. Who the fuck are you? Which gang do you belong to? Enough. Can't you see the grown-ups are talking? I'm sorry boss. Hey, mister partner, shouldn't you know when to shut your mouth? Scared? Mister, I don't know where you crawled out of, but you should stop for your sake. Watch your fucking mouth, bitch! - What the fuck! - Are you fucking nuts?! You're done for now. I'll fucking kill you! Hey! Do you know who I am? So this is how you want it? Assholes! You're all finished! Alright, they bit the bait, just go and wait for my call. Bastards. Fuck off! See them making off. Those bastards ganging up... Sir, I coulda really kicked their asses one-on-one. Hyung-bae. It's all ready for you. Chang-woo... Let's Fuckers! Assholes! Beat them all! Motherfuckers! Where you going?! Head down! I said head down! What the fuck's going on?! I heard about this today. I know this is your turf, but also my Daebu's business. Isn't it better for me to have his back? Let's do it like this. Let's put half of our guys in the club, and you take care of my guys leaving, Okay, I'll prepare some dough. I'll talk to other owners and get as much as possible. But I can't allow any of your boys here. Asswipe, I still got some pride in me. Look here. I still got pride in me too. Got my ass kicked by ignorant thugs, but I'll let it slide since you guys are good friends. I sincerely apologize again for what happened earlier. Is the female owner your bitch? Watch your mouth, asshole. Asshole? Light this cigarette. Go on. Light it. Woke up on the wrong side of bed today? Hyung-bae. I'm not the same snot-nosed kid who used to light your cig. That's it. Let's get you some bruises. Give me a smoke. Synonyms are endure, refuse. Do I always have to get angry before you study? Next. Mr. Choi, we need to talk. All the top positions over to you? And now the bookkeeping too? Do you need anything else? Will you calm down? I found out that the accountant's been stealing quite a bit. I'm gonna shove the shit from your mouth down your throat! What? You crazy bitch! Take this, you bitch! Take them all! I, um, sir... I'm a customer here, customer. Hurry up. will you? Slow fucks, come over here. Asshole, watch it! Watch where you put your hand! Where's your chief? Get me chief Kang! Do you know who I am? We did everything together, you picked the wrong man. Is that so... Now! I'm sorry. Have a good visit, big boss. I think Pan-ho got his story straight with the owner bitch. Otherwise, how could we get arrested together? Is it looking bad for us? I can take care of myself, but you're the problem. Pan-ho's hurt quite a bit. He's hospitalized for 12 weeks. Why did you have to go that far? Shame on him. How could a gangster press charges over a beat... That spineless... There are still ways to solve this, so don't worry too much. What have you got in mind? May 1985, Gyeong-ju Choi C/an Gathering Clan Member of the Month: Prosecutor Choi Joo-dong Joo-dong, how have you been? This is Choi Ik-hyun, he's one of us. How do you do? My name is Choi Joo-dong. Nice to meet you, prosecutor Choi. So, let me see, ah, that's right, so your father... Is that so? Yes, sir. Sir, I think my men made a mistake without knowing what's going on. You still don't get it. There's nothing to check again! Chief Kang, the quarrel between Choi and the owner is a business dispute, and Choi Hyung-bae and Kim Pan-ho situation is a separate matter. That's right. And speaking of Choi Hyung-bae, won't it be better to take care of it without charges? They can settle on their own. Alright, please take care of it. Yes, thank you. They won't be any more problems, Daebu, the chief will take care of it. You didn't have to... This is... As the saying goes, the gold toads are famous for returning the favor. Oh, they sure look loyal alright. It's over now. They are oozing respect. Those crooked bastards... Daebu... I don't trust people easily. Got backstabbed many times. I was imprisoned 5 times, and it was all due to the people who acted like my brothers. Right, humans are the most cunning animal of all. So I had a huge revelation, there's no one to trust except my family... Godammit, Daebu. I feel so confident with you by my side. I love you. Hyung-bae. I want us to surpass our partnership, and become one in mind and body. You got the muscle, I got the brain! We must take this chance to become one and create something big. The stars are lining up just for us! You're right, you're right. May 1987, Busan To wish everyone's bright future and prosperity! Kanpai! Let me formally introduce you. Concerning the hotel we invested in. He's my Daebu. Pleased to meet you. I am Choi Ik-hyun. Nice to meet you. I am Kaneyama Zaidoku. Thank you so much for your help. Expresses his gratitude... Please accept this gift. Thank you. Congressman Park is calling for us downstairs. Let's go and get this over with. Ah, you're here! Let me introduce you. This must be chairman Kaneyama, Choi Hyung-bae here heads our party's Youth Movement. Do it again. He must be nervous for seeing such important men. This is a plaque from the President. This plaque is awarded. Oh, and please take this souvenir, this is called Hodori, the official Olympics mascot. The gold medal isn't really gold, but this sure is! I apprised the President of your request for the hotel casino, so don't worry. We'll now commence the historic opening ceremony. With cutting of the tape, a new era of Daedong Hotel and Casino will begin! One, two, three! Mr. Choi, you really overdid it! You must've finally hit it big! Pretty? Big time my ass. You can't get rich off just two casinos. Gotta have 20 or so in Seoul to be a big shot. There's no end to a man's greed. You gotta see it through no matter what. Can't stop until you reach the top. Do you know why? When I was a kid, my family was the richest in town. Tons of land too... That was real fresh... my father ran for a seat in the parliament independently, and lost the election and our fortune, then died of stress. He placed second in the election. Being second is worthless. You don't get shit for placing second. We lived in poverty afterwards, and I grew up rough all because he placed second. Then what place are you in now? Me? Obviously I'm #1 in Busan. Dunno nationally. What about Hyung-bae? Isn't he #1? What are you talking about! Hyung-bae's under me. His only job is to manage his boys. Is that right? So you're above him? It's... not set in stone, of course, but I guess you could look at it that way. Don't even look alike. Get off the stage! Bastard... Hey you, do you know who I am? Carry on. Hey, supervisor Park! Come over here. Need to talk to you. I need to fucking talk now. Go on. Come here. Ma'am, leave us for a moment. Is that Firetruck? Huh? Fuck, they didn't want to come, what am I suppose to do? Fucking liar, stop shitting in my ears. Asshole, I've been hearing shit. Heard you gave them 2 grand. Then where's remaining 13? Give me half. Any business with money involved should be done cleanly. You think I'm just playing with you?! I'll roundhouse kick your fucking face. Get me the money if you don't want the beat. Got that? Son of a bitch... You know, I'm a taekwondo master! I'll shove your dick up your fucking asshole. Where's your manner? Don't you greet anymore? Afternoon, boss. What a fucking day! Fucking day?! Fucking day! That's enough, boss. You're fucking done, you hear?! Wanna die? Keep at it, asshole! - Boss! - Let go! Boss, you're here. Do you know what he did today? You're finished, asshole! Daebu, if there's a problem with the boys, don't act out on your own and tell me. Welcome, boss. Why is everyone swarmed in here? The government tells us what to do. We assembled so that we could be proactive about this. But withdraw for now. You get snatched up even in a small group nowadays. Son of a What the fuck do you think you are?! You take orders from Hyung-bae but not from me? I'll fucking... Is he upstairs? Look here. We're just now in business, why'd you stir things up? Daebu, a student is a student when he studies, and we're gangsters when we fight. Can't get anything done by being chatty. Is that for me to hear? Hyung-bae, let's settle this amicably, huh? I'll go talk to Pan-ho and hear him out. Whether we go to war or not, I'll take care of it. So step out for this one. How could you say that? What am I? Do you see yourself as a real gangster? Huh?! Daebu, what do you think of yourself? Let me ask you that. Don't you know what this country is like today? It's not the time to fight over the turf. No, don't bother. Don't worry about wrinkles on my ass and worry about yours. I can overlook it since I know what's going on in the world, but what about my boys who're out of work because of you? Is this the only gig in the world? Will this be the only tourist hotel? In a few years, there'll be plenty of casinos for everyone. Then there will be a shortage of people to manage them. What a wonderful era we're living in. Mr. Choi, why don't we use this opportunity to team up? Your connections and my muscle. That's fresh! Look at you... Honestly, if you hand over hotel or casino management, That fuck. Then what? What could he do over me? Who's making a killing because of me? He has no choice but to follow my lead. Then Mr. Choi, it's not easy for us to get together like this, why don't we go have a drink or two? Another time, I'm a little busy today. Sure, you look busy. Stated in his candidacy acceptance speech that he wishes bright future in... - I'm back, boss. - Yeah. Where's the room? It's Crown Hotel just across the street, room #706. I'll be see myself back. Will you be okay, boss? I'm fine. Can't even drive outside anyway. - Yes, boss. I'll be on my way then. - Okay. - Have a good night, boss. - Go on. Yeah? Yeah. Sure. That's right. So, Hyung-bae's there? Abolish the constitution! Overthrow dictatorship! Impeach President Jeon! Impeach President Jeon! Impeach President Jeon! Sir, come over here. What's going on? Here? Yes, boss. What, what happened? Doesn't look like nothing! Is it bad? What did the doctor say? Daebu, could you leave us for a moment? Uh, sure. I'll be back later. We can't let either of them slide. I'll take care of it since you're not well. Find Kim Pan-ho first! Son of a bitch! Son of a bitch! Where's Pan-ho? Where's your boss? Suck my dick. Quite heavy. Look at you now. He's rather cute like this. Where's that grin when you were crawling up Pan-ho's back? Getting scared over a little beating? Prick. In you go. So long. My back's killing me. Please let me live... Fuck, I'm too old for this shit. What the fuck am I doing this for? Huh? It pains me so much. - How is it? - Feels nice? Drink up, it's good for you. Tastes good? Have plenty, boss. That felt good. Should we get something for him too? Must be salty... - Boss, you're still fresh. - I sure am. Go ahead. Hyung-bae, I don't know what you heard about Pan-ho and I, but everything you heard is not the truth. It's not just that, I don't know what I did made you unhappy, but I'm really sorry. Then could you... call off the boys for me? I still got kids, I don't want them to grow up fatherless. I made sure that won't happen, you're not on the hit list. Thank you. You got plans tonight? How about a drink with me? Alright, take care of yourself. I'm off now. Daebu, listen to me carefully. Don't ever step into this world again. Don't go around saying shit either. Understand? This is your share of the hotel casino and the night club. 100 grand in cash, and 200 in bank notes. Is this all? And this is... expensive ginseng the boss prepared for you. Since you're not all that well, rest at home and get well with this. Don't worry, my lips are sealed. What, you got something else to say? Sir, since it's Thanksgiving and all, couldn't you give me some pocket money to buy some ginseng for my folks? That fucking piece of... He was no better than a street pimp, I got him to where he is... How could he do this to me? Can't you get me some bullets? I'll look into it, sir. Please put that away. Mr. Kim. Why are you late... What's with him? Alright, alright, he drank quite a bit. - Let's sit down. - So drunk... I can tell you that it can't be done without an order from the top. Right? That's what I think too. Ignorant fuck. Asshole. But it's still awkward between us. Let me treat you like a big brother. Okay, let's do that. Drink up. Pan-ho, thank you. No one's enemy forever in this business. Yesterday's enemy is today's partner. October 20, 19.90 Busan Prosecutor's Office Now that they became partners, Choi managed to hand over casinos for Samhwa Hotel and Giant Hotel with ease. To Kim Pan-ho. This is getting better and better. Since the government unofficially permits casino Choi had full control over it. So what are we to do? Give 'em what they ask, and sell when they demand. Okay, okay. Then where's Kim Pan-ho now? You two were cozy for a few years, Come on, speak up. As you know, with President's war against organized crime declaration, with 550 members in Busan area starting midnight Friday. As is written in the enforcement order, and if met with resistance, use of fire arms is allowed. I got it. Stop, you shit! Stop right there! From what I've been hearing, they'll continue to investigate further. He's supposedly the most vile prosecutor in recent memory. The Jeollado boys are all locked up because of him. I've never ever met someone who refused money. Sir, we might get all locked up this way. Know what this is? This contact list is worth a million dollars! They'll never lock me in. You just watch. Please help us, Lord. Take this. Sir, so good to see you! Ik-hyun, my wife dragged me out of bed. Your necktie is really beautiful. Oh, is it? Madame's wardrobe is stunning too! When we used to live together... It's been a while, sir. Say hello, you're well acquainted, right? Sir, nice to see you again. Uh, nice to see you too. I'll see you later. What's with you? This isn't right! He's the primary suspect in my case! I think you're gravely mistaken, I wanted to make things right. Sure, let's drink another time. Just the two of us. How could you do this to me? Who helped you out of all the problems Don't you remember? How'd you become the Attorney General this way? You'll never get anywhere. Happy? Bastard... How have you been? How's your wife? Dead, what's it to you? I felt terrible, there were some things that I couldn't tell you, Sure, who knew, right? That's his name, right? We already know about that! Mr. Choi, his glass' empty, Ah, look how slow I am. Here to pass the water too, sir? I hear it's all due to the liver. Been stressed out lately? How dare you put your hands on a prosecutor! Hey, Choi Ik-hyun. You are seriously barking up the wrong tree, I could care less if you're a gangster, asshole! When I say you're a gangster, you are one. Keep a straight face, don't you dare muddy the mood. Did it really? You must be having a hard time. It won't look good of me to get involved at this point in time. Your kind words are enough to comfort me. Yes, sir. Take care. Tougher than I thought... What happened to the boys? Those fuckers... Alright, I'll call back later. Call me if something comes up. Kim Pan-ho! Get him! L-Gt Kim Pan-ho in custody. He's in custody. Dad! -Dad! -Honey! - Dad... - Honey. Sit over there. Know each other, right? - Detective Kim, take him out. - Yes, sir. - Out, out, out! - Will you hold still?! I'm really tired... Really tired. Hey, gangster. Wait, you're not one, right? I hear your kind is called 'half bad-ass', not a gangster but not a civ as well. Just what are you? I'm nothing, just an ordinary man. Am I here to mince words?! Huh?! I'm sorry. You're smart enough to understand. Or 3 years for contract assault? Choi Ik-hyun, just admit it. I'll make sure you serve no more than 3 years. Good? No, no, it's great. Very good, okay! Okay But prosecutor Jo, if it's not trouble... may I suggest something more beneficial for both of us? Go on. English is power. That's right. When you grow up English will help you become #1. - And eat a lot of fish. - Sir! Big boss wants a word with you. Can't you see I'm with my family? Tell him another time. Don't make me fuck you up in front of them. Alright, alright, calm down! L-Gt Sit back down. Let's go talk outside. Have you been busy lately? I know everything. What are you saying? I was interrogated and came out yesterday. As you know, this investigation was initiated by the President. Shut your fucking trap! If I instigated this, why is Pan-ho locked up then? You gotta think logically here. Let's get through this together. We have to help each other. Fuck, I'm being fooled again... Gotta buy some time, ain't it? I really don't know what to do... Prosecutors are kings now. So, what's your plan? I'm prepping to go to the States. Got the house on the market. Why don't you hide out in Kobe for a bit. It might be difficult because of APB, but I could try to find you a boat. If you're fucking with me, your son'll grow up without a father. Make necessary preparations, I'll contact you. How much longer? Almost done. Hello? Um, yes, it's all ready. I'll send you a cal; I want you here. Let's talk face to face. Uh, yeah, okay. But I... What should I do? He wants me to come over. Show me what you got. Sure, it's right here. Let's go. Daebu... do you think you've benefitted because of me? Then how could you conduct yourself this way? I firmly told you to walk away from this life. Yes, you did. Then let me ask you this. I like to think that I tried my best to help you, did any of it make a difference? Isn't that it? In any case, this is the end for us. I know you'll look out for yourself, but be careful. Move! - Back up for him. - Sure, boss. What the hell? What do we do? Everyone standby. Move! Wait! It's you... Go! Go! Son of a bitch! Come out, asshole! Stop the car, asshole! You fucking rat! You're done, piece of shit... You're finished... Die, you fuck! Who you think I am?! Fucking asshole! I won... I fucking won... but he shouldn't be confined to a pond. He should be serving the country, isn't that right? He'll be a big help by your side, Minister. Ah, you're here! Prosecutor Jo, come inside. Appointing Choi Joo-han as Seoul Prosecutor's Office prosecutor. Congratulations. Director, he's the top graduate this year. - Is that right? - Yes, sir. Isn't he a better off at a law firm or the courthouse? Prosecution's no fun these days. - Interesting fellow, none the less. - He sure is. Look at this, look here, what's wrong? Ah, prosecutor Choi! Let me introduce you, this is prosector Choi, my nephew. - He's out in the balcony. - Alright, let's go say hello. Sir, you're out here. The pleasure really is mine. We will now begin Joon-sik's birthday bash! Their faces are turning red. Looks like I hit the spot! Let's move on. Smoke one. No, I'm fine. It's fine. The more I think about it, Joon-sik must be your lucky charm. All the setbacks suddenly washed away. It was the same thing for me too, once we had you. Let me see you. Great job. Father, thank you, for being patient with us. Father... Father... Daebu...
