Doesn't anyone here speak English? - Yes, we do speak English, Mr. Smith. But I know that you speak Spanish. And I know that you are an assassin. The only thing I don't know is who's paying you and who sent you. But believe me, you are going to tell me. (chief speaks in Spanish) (groans) (chief speaking in Spanish) - He was like my brother. - You're making a mistake.

Do you have it? Then plug it in. And don't unplug it until you have seen it all completed. - [Phone] 20%... 30%... 40%... 60%... 70%... 80%... (Rousseau speaks in French) - [Phone] Upload complete. (phone beeping) (soft music playing) - Keepin' the doctor away? - [Smith] Pardon? - With the apples. Isn't that how the saying goes? - There's fourteen ways to kill a man with an apple. Seventeen if the stem is still in. Just kidding. - (chuckles) You are so funny. Do you need a bag, sweetie, or anything else? - No, thank you. (soft music playing continues) (seagulls squawking) - Hey, Mikey. - Hey, thanks, man. (distant kids laughing) (door opens, closes) (footsteps) (music playing continues) - Hey, Howard. Your usual? - Hi. - Coffee black? - No, nothing today. - Okay. - So? - He's, um, over there sitting at the booth. Howard, you're doing okay? - Yeah, I'm good. - Are you sure? - I'm good. - He's been here over an hour. I'm here if you need anything. - Yeah. - Pete? - Sure. Looks like you got yourself in a bad spot, old man. - [Howard] Do you have them? - What? - Money. Passport. Tickets. - I do have. - What does that mean? Where are they? - Nearby. I have to check the codes first. (door opens) - That wasn't the deal, okay? I said you get nothing until I see passport and money. - The decryption codes, Howard. - Look, I got people chasing me. I gotta get out of town. I don't have time for this, okay? I'm out of here. (chair scraping) - Do yourself a favor, Howard. Be smart. - Is everything okay, sir? - Sound is apparent enough. - Hey, it's a nice day outside. We should go for a walk and talk about this. Let's go. - Sorry, gents, but I can't let you leave until I've had a few words with this fella. (punches and kicks thrown) (overlapping grunting) (glasses clanks) - Motherfucker. (glass shatters) (kicks thrown) (body thuds) (rapid gunfire) (bottle clanks) (gun fired) (groans) - You, get up. Your name is Howard, right? (Howard mumbles) Quality. Let me guess. Rich mommy and daddy. Ivy League education. Pretty little wife. Couple of kids at home. Now why the fuck would you keep that out. You know my problem is, Howard? I've been a contractor for a very long time. Much of it for good man who takes good care of me. The same man that gave you a job. I've been looking after you. We'll get on of it now, huh? Thailand stands still, right? So we've got to think of the future. The governor, he'd like to retire. The company, it has been liquidated. So where does that leave us, right? Uncertain times indeed. Now I don't know about you, mate, but I got plans. 20-five years of doing this shite. It's done my fucking head in. Now, I want to live in a house on a beach. Somewhere in Asia. I can fish off my boat. And not be looking over my shoulder for the rest of my life. I think I deserve it. And the boss, he deserves it too because he's a diamond geezer. So if I hear that you've interfered with the sale of his company- - I didn't do it. I swear. I swear. - The code, Howie. Where are they? And where's Rousseau? - I told you I don't have the codes. I don't know. I don't know. - But you know where Rousseau is, right? - No, I don't. - You know, problem for you, Howie, is I'm starting to believe you. And that ain't good for you, sir. (perplexed breathing) (gun cocks) - Okay, okay. Okay. Okay. - Wise decision. (phone beeping) (tense music playing) - Good morning, Gov. I just had a little chat with Howard. He had MIT. - No. No, no, no, no. (gun fired) - Really? I'd long gone by now. How'd you find him? I don't need to know. What'd you find out? - He doesn't have the decryption codes. He already sold them Rousseau. But now, they've been re-encrypted. - Are you sure? - Positive. - And? - The emails, the information, it's already been leaked. It's all over the internet. Fortunately, no one will be able to make sense of 'em until it's decrypted. (chair scrapes) - If that information is made public, it's all over. A deal we're dealing with will be the dead. And the other things, things we've had to do to survive. It's all in there. A lifetime of work... Gone in an instant. - I think I know where he is. - Where? - Tijuana, Mexico. By the border. - What's he doing there? - I guess as he plans to cross into the states, we've got to get to him first. - Do whatever it takes. - No worries. Considered it sorted. (phone beeping) (footsteps) (intense music playing) - Sorry about your wife, John. - It's okay. (bag thuds) - For ex-fil, just in case. - Thanks. I got it. - Thanks. He'll get you where you're going? No questions. (rope thuds) It's all below deck. Long range, short range, anti-surveillance, and one-time pad. And a cold one in the fridge. Take care of yourself, John. (intense music playing continues) (newspaper thuds) - Reminds me of Madrid. Nice tables. Pigeons. Coffee tastes like shit though. - Are we good? - Not really. - What does that mean? - Means you made a mess of things down in Bolivia. Three dead cops. Chief of Police, for Christ's sake. - I had no choice. They had to die. - Really? Well, I'm gonna have to take an extra 10% just to fix things. (waitress speaks in foreign language) - Oh, gracia. - What's next? - You do understand that you're a difficult asset to sell right now, huh? Subtlety is no longer your strong suit. Wanna tell me what's going on, John? - I'm the best solo asset you've got and you know it. - I can't book what people don't want. Our clients pay... They pay for discretion, John. When they hire somebody to clean up a mess or mitigate a risk, they don't want some fucking cowboy to go in there and turning simple John into a goddamn bloodbath. Gonna cut yourself some slack, huh? You've been through a lot. Take a break, maybe. There's not a lot going on anyway. - There's always something What do you got? - Got an open contract. The border. Tijuana. - Open contracts are for amateurs. Either they hire me or they don't. - It's all I got, brother. It's your call. If you want the gig, you can pick up the job description at HR. See you around.

Former tech innovator turned hacker and leaker. His actions are linked to the fall of several multinational corporations, a drug cartel, and an African dictator. Credible Intel shows that he's preparing a data dump that will expose fraud and corruption within a U.S. conglomerate. Rousseau was last seen with his private security detail at the Grand Hotel in downtown Tijuana. Auxiliary detachment zero will steward covert access at nine hundred hours. Nearby Barrios may provide cover to base operations and avoid in theater operators hunting the seven-figure bounty. Discretion and expediency are paramount. Seek. Locate. Terminate with prejudice.

No, no, no. I'm sorry, sorry, sorry. It's bow tie. Bow tie. - I don't work with people I don't know. - I'm all he could get on such short notice. How long you're going to need? - Two days. Maybe three. You can keep the staff out here, right? - Yeah, sure. - I'm going to need some eyes and a little help from guest services, if you're up for it. - Yes, whatever you need. I got you. - All right. Here's the guy we have to find. Heavy French accent. Probably checked in within the last few days. (suspenseful music playing) - Sykes. What are you doing? (phone ringing) - Talk to me, Chico. - [Chico] I found your guy. I got his room number. (elevator pings) It looks like he has a security detail. - Yeah, I know her. - Really? No shit. - [John] It's Sykes. She's usually working at an angle. - [Chico] All right, so how do you want to proceed? - We're going to need to separate her from the target. Come on. Let's get ready. (dramatic music) Okay, Chico, you ready for this? - In and out, right? - In and out. Don't linger. I know these operators. They will make you. - Hey, did you ever sleep with her? - Which one? - Either? - We're just colleagues. - Right. - Are you carrying? Leave this to me, okay? You're safer without it. Come on. Let's get going here. We're burning daylight. (television beeps) Now remember, Chico, in and out. - In and out. Right. (cart wheels rolling) (suspenseful music playing) (knocks on door) - Room service. (door opens) Room service? - Hold on. (door closes) Over there. Spread arm. Up, up. (bites apple) You're good. - Thank you. Good morning, sir. You have your breakfast here. (plate clanks) Some orange juice. And some decoration for the table. Wow, a dollar. Thank you. You'll do now. - Will you been needing anything else? - No, this is...it. This is fine. - Wow. You really do have a great view from this suite. - In and out. - Yes, we do. - You know, there's a lot of things you do in Tijuana. If you have the time. Will you be staying long? - No. Just for business. - Well that's a shame. You can go shopping. There's restaurants, music, art. (laughing) - Get out of there, Chico. - I'm very serious, sir. I mean we have great clothing stores, great shoe stores, great computer stores. We even have a great time-- - (speaks in foreign language) Hm? - What the hell is this? - What did you say? - Get out of there. - I just said there's great stores in Tijuana. - No, no, no. He said computer stores. - Why? Why? - Look at me. Why? (suspenseful music playing) - Whoa! (clanking) - Smith. - Yeah. - Go to the door! (punches throwing) (overlapping grunting) (rapid pressing of elevator button) (punches throwing) (overlapping grunting) - Thanks, Chico. (elevator pings) - Nice to see you again, John.

(keys jingle) Go! (coughing) (car beeps) - Oh. Don't... don't touch me. (car door closes) Who the fuck are you?! (car engine revving) (car tire screeching) - I need to have a word with you. Where's Smith? Oy. Oy. Where's Smith? - I--I don't know. - Is that right? How'd you know him? - A guy paid me 3000 bucks to help him out. - Who was the guy? - Edgar...Edgar some--something. I don't remember. - Edgar Mann. This yours? - Yeah. - Unlock it. - So...so you know him, right? - Yeah. We've met. So how did he contact you? - Baysanos Bar. He has people that work there. So you guys are cool, right? Right, you guys are cool? You guys are friends? - Actually, no. (muffled cry) (gun fired) - Are you going to kill me? (groans) (rapid gun fire) - I...I can pay you. I--I--I have money. Please, please, please. I beg. I beg. Please, please don't shoot me. I can pay. Please. - Get down. - Please. - Get down! - Please. (Rousseau speaking in French) - Are you married? Are you married?! (Rousseau speaking in French) - She's dead. And the lady, break failure. The car company said it was 'driver error.' Bullshit. Manufacturing defect. I hacked into the file to prove it. That is what they do, you see. They make as much money as possible. And fuck you if you're in the way. There is no accountability. The government, they are pussies. It is why I do. I fill the void when they are murderers. I hold up the mirror. (sniffles) It was three years ago when they died. Maybe... it is over. Maybe now it is finished. - Get in the car. (sniffling) (car door closes) - What's this all about anyways? - Silver. He behaves like a king but he's a thug. He has built an empire but with mob connections and insider trading, anything crooked. But he's stupid and greedy. Now, all his holdings are only worth something on paper. - Yeah. - And he plans on selling it all to the highest bidder. - Exact demo. He did is toxic. So I use some leverage on one of his guys inside using some of Silver's own money. And I've got some data that explains exactly how much in the red he actually is. I encrypted it and I hid it on the internet. Now he wants his data back. - And you can decrypt this data? - Oh, yeah. Not a problem. - How? - Using codes in my head. - [John] So how much are you paying Sykes? - 100 grand. - You've got a million-dollar purse on your head. How long do you think she was going to pretend to protect you? - Okay. What is your plan? - Get to the border. I'll get you to the U.S. Marshals in San Diego. They can protect you. - Thank you for not shooting me but I don't want to be prosecuted. - You got a much better chance of making your case in court than you do out here. Do you have any idea how many hitmen are after you? - He has a meathead to kills for him. - Yeah, like gloves. Funny accent. - So Henrik Botha from London. You know him? - I used to. - Jesus Christ, you guys you all know each other. (biker grunts) (car door closes) - Oh, really? Where am I going to go, huh? - Just look natural. I'll be back. - Natural how? I'll have a soda. Agh. (entrance pings) (fridge door closes) - How much? (car register beeps) - It's two. Two dollars. (entrance pinging) (rapid gunfire) - Fuck! Fuck! Fuck! (rapid gunfire continues) (entrance pings) - Aaahhh! (man speaks in Spanish) (Smith speaks in Spanish) (man speaks in Spanish) (Smith speaks in Spanish) (man speaks in Spanish) (speaks in Spanish) (gun fired) - Ah! Jesus Christ! You could have killed me! - Get in the car. (tense music playing) (car honking) (tense music playing) (paper bag rustling) (tense music playing continues) (cars honking) - Does this car have a GPS? - What? - Did Sykes put a GPS tracker in the car? - I don't know. It is possible. - Son of a bitch. Stay low. (cars honking) (suspenseful music playing) Okay. Time to go. - What? - Come on. (cars honking) (kicking and punches throwing) (overlapping grunting) (gun fired) (crowd screaming) (footsteps approaching) - Who the hell is John Smith? - He's just another shooter for hire. - You know him? - Once upon a time, yeah. - (sighs) Maybe this wasn't such a good idea. There's too many operators. Too many variables. - I'm on top of it, governor. - Has the security detail contacted us yet? - She will. She wants to get paid, so she'll make the exchange. - Fine. Set it up. Get the codes. - It's so fragile. All of this money... Life... So very fragile. If you get me out of this, I'll make you a rich man, Henrik. Richer than you ever dreamed. Kill everyone. I need this to go away. All of it. Please. - I'll take care all of it, boss. You get some sleep. (dramatic music) (intense musical build-up, fades) (upbeat music playing on bar speaker) (John speaks in Spanish) (Javier speaking in Spanish) (whispering in Spanish) (music stops) (phone ringing) - Hola? - I lost him. - Lost him? I thought you were gonna kill him. - Yeah. About that, we're taking the Marshall's bounty. - [Mann] That's a fraction as much?! - We're taking it. - I told you to 'be subtle.' Not 'go soft.' But look, I'm glad you called. There's been a wrinkle. It seems that Rousseau has held on to some of the codes to decrypt the data that he stole from Silver. And now Silver wants it back. - So I've heard. Sykes must be holding Rousseau for a ransom. That's why she didn't just put a bullet in his head when she had the chance. - Yeah. And I don't think he's gonna be willing to pay her. - He may think we have the codes at this point. Are you safe? - Am I safe? (laughs) I'm an enigma. I'm a mystery. I'm the fucking needle in the haystack, baby. Nobody can find me. - [John] Yeah. Yeah. How do I find Rousseau? - I don't think that's gonna be too hard. I've been looking at his website. I think he took him to the De La Rosa development. It's private. It's one of those developments. It isn't finished. Never gonna be finished. But he's got a million-dollar view. It's a great place to hide out and issue ransom demands. I think he posted something with his smartphone trying to send us a message. But look, there's something more you should know. Where are you right now? - At the Dead Drop. (dramatic music) - All right, John, listen to me. Listen to me very carefully. I want you to get up and I want you to get out of that bar. Do you understand me? Silver has widened the contract to anybody associated with this job. He's burning the whole project. He's gonna fill your lap with locals. He's sending in an enforcer after Sykes and Rousseau. Smith? Smith?! - I gotta go. (phone dial beeps) - You ain't going nowhere. (John speaks in Spanish) (punches thrown) (chair sliding) (punches thrown) (rapid gunfire) (punches thrown) (gun cocks) (gun cocks, fired) (grunts) - Fuck! (breathing heavily) (John speaks in foreign language) (car door closes) (siren wailing) (car door closes) (John speaks in foreign language) Esperanza. (girl speaking in foreign language) (phone dial beeps) (phone ringing) (John breathing heavily) (knocking on door) (door closes) - What happened? - I had a disagreement. - Let me help you. (John grunts) - I'm sorry. This has to come out. I'll get some things. I'll be right back. (distant siren wailing) (cupboard door opens, closes) (clanking) (breathing heavily) - One left. Are you ready? - Don't tell me. Just do it. (grunting) - You're gonna be okay. - Yeah. I think I'm going to be fine. Ugh. Sorry about your sheets. - They've seen worse. I was married once too. - What happened? - You know what they say. Don't go into business with family. Maybe not so good idea to fall in love and marry your pimp. It didn't last, anyway. What happened to your wife? - Not much to tell. She's in a better place. - I'm sorry. (romantic music playing) (phone ringing) (phone ringing) (distant car honking) - [Esperanza] Is everything okay? - I gotta go. - Right now? - Yeah. - Okay, I'll make some coffee. (footsteps) - [Esperanza] What's wrong? - We gotta go. - What? - Now! (suspenseful music playing) (panting) (grunting) (rapid gunfire) - Ahh! (rapid gunfire continues) - Go! Go! (rapid gunfire) (rapid gunfire) (car window shatters) (car door closes) (car engine revs) (rapid gunfire) (phone ringing) - Yeah? - An open contract? Are you fucking kidding me? - What can I say? The economy is slow. - You bring me Rousseau, I'll let you live. - Mm, I can't do that. - Sure you can. You stick him in a booty of your motor and you bring him to me now. Easy peasy. - I got my bounty. - What? The Marshall's? (laughs) Yeah, I mean a lot of fun. Yeah? Look, because you went soft doesn't mean you have to go stupid. What the fuck happened to you? I knew you when you were young. In your prime, I treated you like a little brother. - See you around, Henrik. Do you like the coast? - Yeah. (gear shifts) - They're in there? - Yeah. Esperanza, listen. I want you to take the car. Get out of here. Keep driving. Just head south until all this blows over. - I don't want to leave. Please. Let me stay. - Look, I'm not likely to make this happen. And even if I do, I'm gonna have to run. You're safer gone. (kisses) Take care of yourself. (car door closes) - You know, he's not going to pay you. He does not have any money. He is going to have you killed. I can pay you. I have money. (Rousseau speaking in foreign language) You take me to the U.S. Marshal. Oh, come on. How many people do you think are going to come? Come to kill you. Not just professionals like Smith and Botha, but local contractors. 20, maybe 30. How many people do you think you can take on your own? Six? Eight? A dozen, you crazy lesbian. - Would you shut up?! (rapid gunfire) - Get up! Take the stairs. - Sykes, Silver's burned us. We gotta get out of here. - This way. - Sykes! (door slides) - Get in. - Sykes, it's time to ex-fil. - Not until I get my money. - He's never going to pay you. (gun fired) - He will if he wants his data back! - I'll get him out of here and you can just disappear. (gun fired) (grunts) (gun thuds) (breathing heavily) - You've lost it. You're soft. - Just go. (groaning) (distant siren wailing) - Lucky you. - [John] Botha. I know you're out there, Botha. And I'm ready for you. - [Rousseau] Mr. Smith. Mr. Smith. Is that you? (gun fired) (groans) (punches throwing) (overlapping grunting) (glass shattering) - Is that all you got, John? You're gonna have to do better than that if you're gonna take up the king of this jungle. You're in the endgame, mate. I came here for him. But if you get in my way, I'm gonna have you for lunch, son. (kicks throwing) You wanna fight or you're gonna dance around like a fucking ballerina all night? (punches throwing) (overlapping grunting) You fucked up, John. You sided with a mock and you broke the code when you made that decision to you would end up like this. You and me, you're either very brave or very fucking stupid. I'm gonna make this quick for old time sake. I guess it's a good thing for you it's me rather than some cheaper stranger. - Don't you ever get tired of it? - Botha! (rapid gunfire) - Now we're even. See you around, John. - See you around, Sykes. (soft dramatic music) - You came back. - I never left. - Rousseau, Esperanza. - Hey. - What do you think will happen? - They'll take you into custody. Probably book you, hold you till the morning, and the Marshals will take you away. (Rousseau exhales) Hey, it's your chance to make your case. It's your day in court. - Idiot. Well, you are right. And, uh, what will you do? - Head South? - Yes. - Disappear for a while. Start over. - Well, um... (speaks in French) - Good luck. - Mademoiselle. - Take care of yourself.
