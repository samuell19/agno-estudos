[Nanette] The name McAfee reminds me of my very first laptop. Like most PCs in the '90s, it had McAfee antivirus software pre-installed. [man] Software security guru John McAfee, he made millions as one of the nation's first big software pioneers. [Nanette] I didn't think about that name again until 2012, when John McAfee was all over the news. [man] John McAfee, whose name was synonymous with security, is now becoming synonymous with the mysterious murder of McAfee's neighbor, Greg Faull. [Nanette] I read about John's bizarre lifestyle in Belize, including being wanted for questioning in a homicide and going on the run. [man] A murder in paradise, as police launch a full-scale search for an eccentric American tycoon, John McAfee. [Nanette] 2016, just a few years later, John was again in the news, this time, he was running for President of the United States. Antivirus software industry pioneer John McAfee, throwing his hat into the 2016 presidential ring. What has created terrorism? Our interference in the affairs of foreign states. Dropping bombs on families. [Nanette] And talking about some of the most significant cybersecurity issues of our time. But no one was talking about his past. You are an expert, and I know you're brilliant when it comes to matters of security. We are in the first cyber war. You said that you could unlock the San Bernardino terrorists' phones for the FBI. [Nanette] How did John McAfee reinvent himself? Are there different rules for people with money, power, and fame? Or is John just a master manipulator? The last 15 years, I've been making documentaries on complex and controversial celebrities. I've been fascinated with how being famous can put you under a cruel spotlight. But it can also allow for extraordinary privileges. Like the ability to get away with things. Was this the case with John McAfee? [man] John, where are you going? [John] To jail.

Approximately every four, six months, U.S. Marshals will come down. They already know where everybody is. They'll go through the island and just make a sweep. [Tamara] There's expats here that really like to immerse themselves with the local culture. And the, you know, the local culture loves a rich man, you know? [Daniel] Everybody knew John McAfee. [laughs] When he first came into the country, he was very friendly. I really thought he was a very nice person. He bought prime property. He used to bring his friends from the States. We are getting a lot of tourists because of him. [Tamara] John started donating things to the police department. Very generous. Extremely generous. He told us, "Guys, anything, you need help, my doors are open." [Paul] He donated a considerable amount of equipment to police. Boots, stun guns, different assortment of weapons. [Tom] I recall, when he get his residence card here, he gave the government of Belize a $1 million boat. And that made the news here. [man] Why this donation to the Coast Guard? I've just become a permanent resident of Belize, and I'm very grateful that the country of Belize allowed me to live here permanently. And I wanted to give something back. [Tamara] You have to wonder, if you're giving donations to the police, is it out of the goodness of your heart? Or are there some motives behind it?

[man] McAfee started a ferry service. He's also cultivating jungle plants that he hopes will be the building blocks for medicines of the future. [Allison] I was doing my postdoc, I was at Harvard, but I always heard about Belize. Just how amazing the jungles were and the local healers. Decided to go to Belize and just see what it was all about, you know? But anyway, we'll talk about that, then. [Allison] I ended up meeting John McAfee. Yeah, I didn't know him from Adam, but I told him about my research, and he seemed engaged. He seemed interested, and within, you know, minutes of conversation, he offered me my dream job. He said, "You can continue your research, and we'll make a business out of it." And I thought, "Oh, my God." I mean, this is-- this is it. This is, like, my big break. There was not a space for the lab, and he had me stay with him, um, which made me very uncomfortable. I saw a lot of stuff when I was living in his place. He had armed guards. I'm not a huge fan of guns. Um, he had meetings with people that were also armed. Um-- At one point he said that he was working on a book with two heavily armed, very built men from the Ukraine. I mean, I don't know, this is probably not relevant. - I'm sorry, this is-- - [Nanette] That's okay. This is the tangent that I told you I would go on. [Nanette] Yeah, that's okay. That's part of interviewing. - It's just, there's-- - [Nanette] There's a lot of tangents. People--we all do it. Oh, fuck, there's just-- there's so much crazy shit. There's so much crazy shit that I don't even know-- You know, it's hard to know where to start. [laughs] [Nanette] I wanted to start with John's past. In emails he was evasive. But I managed to dig up some of his records. He was born in England, and grew up an only child in Virginia. According to John, his father was an abusive alcoholic and committed suicide when John was young. Eventually, John graduated college and became a computer engineer. In the 1980s, he tried his luck in Silicon Valley. [phone beeps] McAfee, may I help you? Speaking. It's one of those strange days. [Jim] His first efforts with antivirus were in late '86. And, uh, he was always playing with different kinds of code. There was this new problem with computers, that was a--your computer could catch a cold. Okay, there it goes. In Budapest, uh, we have a hospital that lost 25 systems. Uh, including all patient records--hello? When John came up with antiviral software, 90% of the people that were running computers weren't even aware of viruses. And then viruses started getting names. [man] It's called Michelangelo. It's a lowdown work of sabotage that could wreck millions of computer programs around the world. What is a computer virus? A computer virus, Bryant, is a program written by a hacker. Any computer that it's in, it activates and destroys all of the data in those systems. John showed his first signs of savvy, working with the media. Able to articulate a scary story. This doomsday virus was about to hit. [electronic droning] The entire research community agrees, this is the number one virus. it is the number one computer threat. It's real, and it's going to happen on the 6th of March. [Mark] The Michelangelo Virus caused many people around the world to download antivirus software for the first time. That's how the money just started rolling in. By 1993, McAfee controlled 67% of the desktop antivirus market. They only had about 20 employees. Do not stand in doorways. Stand against-- [Mark] But there were already, like, $14 million in revenue. - They were printing money. - Excuse me. It still was a group of John's original friends and family that worked there. A lot of them didn't have careers before. Excuse me. Gretzky, Tech Support. John had more, like, a cult style. And people would not go home for two and three days. They would sleep under their desk to make sure John was happy with the work they were doing. Okay, what you need to do in your AUTOEXEC.BAT file-- [Andrea] It was a crazy culture, that's for sure. Three of the women were supposedly witches, and they would sit in the conference room and have, like, a little chant. Andrea Nation would come in in the morning with a bottle of Windex and clean off Bill Larson's desk. Because there was a sex contest going on. You'd get points. They had a group called Little Foxes, where they, um, would give points for, uh, having sex in different spots of the office. John being this free spirit, that made the culture of the company. He wasn't the typical suit and tie guy. The investors wanted to take the company to the next level. And that was definitely not John's forte. They felt like John couldn't do that and I think that John didn't want to do it, either. They bought John out. They bought his shares out. [computer beeping] He sensed the virus threat in a way that most people didn't. He seemed brilliant but also paranoid. He is more sensitive than, maybe, the average person to potential threats. My wife thought it a little funny when he came next door, looking for his wife Judy, who was over visiting with us, 'cause he wasn't home yet. And he shows up, and he--and so, I let him in the house and he's got a gun in his back pocket. And I says-- Susan said, you know, uh, "Is that a gun in your pocket, or are you just happy to see me?" [laughs] You know? And, you know, he just, "Oh, well, you know, it's dark out, there's no street lights on this street. You never know." But they were making quite a bit of money then. And maybe somebody kidnapped his wife. So he came over to see if we'd seen her. Is that paranoid? I don't know. ♪ pensive music ♪ ♪♪♪ [Nanette] After earning millions in Silicon Valley, John did not retire. He created social network ventures like Tribal Voice and PowWow. But they didn't take off. Then in 2000, he exited the business world completely. He bought 280 acres of land in Colorado and opened a yoga and meditation center. [John] I've been doing yoga and meditation for 35 years. Given the life that I lead-- and I admit, I lead life on the edge. I have to do something. So I believe in yoga. Yoga will extend your life, and it'll also give you a clear perspective of yourself. [Nanette] I asked John how he got involved in yoga. After he opened his yoga center, he began inviting people to stay there. Got up there, and there's this beautiful house. These stunning yoga studios and probably space for about 25 people to sleep. Massive grounds and literally like his own forest. It was kind of too big to even get my head around, this massive place that one guy owned. And he'd let you stay there for free. Pain is nothing more than a powerful sensation, is it not? I mean, it's--it's your body talking to you like your body talks to you when you get a massage or when you're sexually aroused. [Paul] Yeah, there was rumors in town it was a cult that he had up there, up in the hills. [laughs] [Goldy] He always had an entourage, like, a tribe, which was beautiful. What is this thing that you want to make immortal? Because to live is to die simultaneously. I truly believe he was--he was enlightened. He was--he was a guru. He'd written five books on the yoga process. They're really good. Later, I remember him saying that they were all shit. [laughs] He was insinuating that he wasn't into that stuff anymore. You know, there was a definite shift in personality. He was a different-- I mean, you could-- he was still John. You know, but he was not-- he just wasn't a guru-type anymore. He didn't have-- he wasn't enlightened. [laughs] The next time I saw him, I'm like, "Okay." [keyboard clacking] [man] In this recession, the average American is certainly pinching every penny. But the man you are about to meet is one of the biggest losers. It's staggering, really. [man] Good morning, ladies and gentlemen. Welcome to the estate of John McAfee. [man] On Saturday, auctioneers worked up bids for the rarified retreat of a wealthy man who's taken it on the chin in this recession. It's been reported you were worth about $100 million. - That may have been true. - Yet now you're-- - Less than ten. - Less than $10 million. You bet. [man] You seem so remarkably relaxed for someone who's lost about $90 million. Well, yeah. And why wouldn't I be? The things we want and the things we need are two different things. [man] Did it take you a while to come to that realization? Yeah, about 65 years. [man] Now, McAfee plans to take his remaining handful of millions and head to Central America, where he started a new venture to develop natural medicines.

So when I come back in a year, this will look a lot different, - I would imagine. - Right, well, you'll see - shade cloth everywhere. - Mm-hmm.

And now I'm a danger to the government. They talk about murdering me. They talk about murdering all my cohorts and friends. They talk about planting drugs and guns. I was terrified now that they were coming for me. ♪♪♪ [Cassian laughs] ♪♪♪ When he came back, then he brought the entourage of all the bodyguards, all of the prostitutes and girls that were with him. To see somebody on a tourist beach, and they have two or three armed guards, that's very intimidating to the tourists as well as the locals. It disturbed the locals quite a bit. McAfee had a reputation in the neighborhood. Greg said he's just a rich American and he's just terrorizing the neighborhood. Greg was very vocal of not liking McAfee and I heard from other people that McAfee didn't like Greg. I think he lived 600 feet south of John McAfee on the beach. Gregory Faull, he came to retire in Belize, and because he was into construction, he was going to build and sell homes and that's how he was surviving. So this was a hard-working man. [Eddie] Greg, he always told me, "You know, I love to walk from my house down the beach to Rojo Lounge. To go to eat and have a few drinks." He says, "But McAfee has armed guards on the beach. Not one. Several. Including some mean dogs." [Tamara] His dogs ran loose on the beach and they were really ferocious dogs. And I even remember walking by there one time and these dogs were just-- really lay into you. [dog barks] Greg went to McAfee's house. [dog barks] And said, "John, you gotta take care of these dogs. They're disturbing the neighborhood." And John reached over to one side and came back with a 12-gauge shotgun, cycled the shotgun, says, "Get off my property or I'll shoot your ass." [Eddie] Greg came to me and he says, "Eddie, I got this problem that is not going to go away." So I told him, "This is not something to play with. Go to the police. Make a report." [Daniel] Greg did put a complaint against John's dogs. And I did respond to Greg. [dog barks] [Eddie] The Mayor says, "I've talked to the police to go up there and deal with it," but that didn't change him. Why would it change a man who is buttering the police with Tasers, with vehicle, with guns? [Tamara] Greg Faull had had it with those dogs, and said, "I'm gonna poison those dogs." A day later, John's dogs were poisoned. About 12 in the night, one of the security came and said that the dogs is foaming through their mouth. So he went and he saw the dog. And then he said, you know, "The dogs have been poisoned." That's what he said. The first thing came in his mind was that it was his neighbor. - [Nanette] Greg? - Mm, Gregory Faull. ♪♪♪ He got his shotgun. And I said, "What are you gonna do?" And he said he is gonna take the dog out of their misery. And then he started crying. I never saw him cry until that day. And, um, he went to the dogs and he shot the dogs. [Marcia] He was walking, like, from one side of the room to the other side. While he was walking, he was smoking cigarette after cigarette, cigarette after cigarette, cigarette after cigarette. He said, "I wonder if it's Greg Faull that poisoned my dogs." You know? [man] Oh, look. Look who's here. - [man] Nice to see you, man. - [man] Oh, how are you? [Eddie] He left me a message that night, saying that, "There's somebody in my yard." [bird chirping] And I said, "Do you want me to come up?" "No, no," he says. "It's okay. I just wanted you to know." He was nervous, that's why he called me. He says, um, "I don't feel good about it." [water splashing] [wood pounding] - [gunshot] - [bird squawks] The next day, Mr. Faull was found dead. [seagulls squawking] [Eddie] In the morning, early, my nephew, Finn, calls me and he says, "Tio, have you heard?" I said, "Heard what, Finn?" He says, "Greg is dead." I says, "Oh, shit." I still can't believe it. [Tamara] There's no sign of burglary. Nothing was missing. The place wasn't ransacked. It just appeared that he had basically been executed. [Nanette] And were there any other marks on his body? His whole body covered in Taser marks, which were not necessary. [Art] Sometimes I have visions of what happens when you get shot in the head. And I just can't believe it ever happened to my son. [Nanette] Why were you looking for John? Well, because... Yeah. [man] A murder in paradise. Police launch a full-scale search for an eccentric American tycoon, John McAfee. Some breaking news from Belize. John McAfee, who's been on the run-- [man] John McAfee is a person of interest in the murder of his neighbor. Tech mogul at the center of an international murder mystery. Tonight, McAfee is being hunted for questioning in the murder of his neighbor. [Daniel] We had CNN in English, we had CNN in Spanish, NBC, ABC, the whole alphabet. If you're fearing for your safety, why not just go in and tell them what you don't know - about this murder? - [John] If I am detained, this is where people just simply disappear. They choke on their own vomit or hang themselves or are beaten to death by fellow prisoners. [Samantha] John sent me a text and said, "We have to move." And I went to take out money from John's account. $2,000. And I took it where he was hiding at the boat place. [Tom] Two days after the Greg Faull thing, John calls me and says, "I need you to keep me safe and get me out of the country alive." ♪♪♪ We went to, like, a Chinese place, where he started painting his hair and that's where Tom took us. I had some sleepless nights because I'd have to get up and move him to another location. Then I start meeting journalists. [Samantha] He, um, contacted the press 'cause he said he wanted to clear his side of the story and why he is on the run. The search to find John McAfee began right here at the airport, not long after I landed. And it began with three simple words. "Sorry, I'm late." A prearranged code word to let me know I'd met the person who would take me to McAfee. [Martin] And so we get in this cab and take off on just a crazy drive through Belize City. It was like a bad movie. We were doing, you know, switchbacks and turnarounds and then it's like, "Get out! Get out!" And then we--he's like, "No, get in there!" And it's another cab we get in. [laughs] It's not the Belize you see in the travel pictures. You know, this is not the pretty part. And then eventually, we stop in the parking lot of a really low-rent looking hotel. When we finally got to John McAfee, he's wearing an outlandish disguise. Kind of like an old man with a crippled arm, powder in his hair to make himself look old. And he's walking with a cane. John McAfee is coming towards us. Only it wasn't John McAfee. It was John McAfee in really-- in a really bad disguise. We all knew it was John McAfee. But your problem is that you really wanna talk to him, and I'm afraid that if I say, "Hey John, how you doing?" he's going to explode and--and storm off, and our opportunity to interview him would be lost. So we did what we thought was the prudent thing to do, and that was ignore him. We get up to his hotel room. And 20 seconds later, he bursts into the room. And the shawl he had over his shoulders, he flings off. And he shakes his hair of all this powder. "Fooled you, didn't I?" And, of course, you're like, "Yeah. You sure did." And then, there we were. Face to face. [Martin] Did you kill Greg Faull? I barely knew the man. And why would I kill him? He was a neighbor that lived 200 yards down the beach. [Martin] Do you really believe that this is a vendetta by the government of Belize - to take you down and kill you? - Absolutely, sir. You're sincerely concerned that if you somehow wind up in their custody, they're going to assassinate you? [John] Absolutely. [man] Do you really think they would kill you? [John] Absolutely, I do, sir. [Art] It was all about McAfee. Everything that we've ever seen was McAfee, McAfee, McAfee, who murdered an American businessman. McAfee who did this, McAfee who did that. But there wasn't very much, uh, publicity for my son. McAfee found a way to keep the attention on him. We have a President, a Prime Minister, you have the Mayor of San Pedro, the Minister of Tourism, all giving interviews about a man who's just bat-shit crazy. Well, I've never met the man. Don't know what he looks like. Uh, I don't want to be unkind, but it strikes me that he's extremely paranoid. In fact, I would go so far as to say bonkers. [Tom] By then, everybody know who is John McAfee. I couldn't hide him no more. So we drove to the southernmost border with Guatemala. It's 200 miles south of Belize City. He saw me bullshit my way through many checkpoints in the time we knew each other. He knew I could get him out. [Nanette] So how did you get him out of the country? I--we just put him on a boat and dump him on land in Guatemala. We didn't--no customs, no immigration, no nothing. That's illegal. I told him I could've gotten his passport legally stamped in a place called Puerto Barrios. But once he knew he was getting out in a boat, he took complete control. He's John again. He does what he wants to do. All my advice to him never really mattered anymore. He's John McAfee now. The great escape. [laughs] ♪♪♪ [John] I could walk into the police station, ask directions, and they would give me directions. [Jose] VICE TV followed him and they just decide to take a picture with the iPhone. [Samantha] They found out his location. [Nanette] How did that happen? With some picture that VICE took with GPS where it was on or something like that. [Jose] You know, you had VICE TV posting that picture that does give away his location. He was undone by that in Guatemala. You know, the tech guy. Who would have thunk? Now he's in trouble with Guatemala by entering the country illegally. That's when I told him, you know, "I have an uncle who could help you. I think he could be your lawyer and take you out of the country if you want." [woman] McAfee, who is wanted for questioning in connection with a murder in Belize, says he will be seeking asylum in Guatemala and has retained high-profile Guatemalan attorney and former attorney general Telésforo Guerra. [Nanette] So when he was in Guatemala, was he still considered a suspect, or was he-- [Nanette] So you tried to have him extradited? [Nanette] Interpol discovered John's exact location. And VICE was the only camera crew to capture his arrest. - [man] What's the problem? - They're trying to arrest me for coming into the country illegally. Can't they take me back to Belize tonight? - No, never. Never, never. - Are you sure? Can you promise me, sir? Because I'm not worried - about anything else. - Of course, they won't take you to Belize, no. Never, never. [Telésforo] I will go with you. [man] Whoa, whoa, wait. [woman] "Thank God I'm in a place where there is some sanity." Those were the words John McAfee said before being arrested in Guatemala City on Wednesday night for illegal entry. [John] I was put in jail, and the following morning, they were intending to deport me back to Belize. My lawyer came to my cell. "He said, I cannot file an appeal until three o'clock. So until three, they can deport you." He said, "Do you understand?" I go, "Yes, I understand fully." [man] Within sight of the assembled cameras, John McAfee suddenly swooned, and appeared to lose consciousness. [sirens wail] [John] So I chose to fake a heart attack. [man] John McAfee was rushed to a hospital, complaining of chest pains. [woman] Quite a scene was created, as an ambulance took him from an immigration detention center. [John] They took me to the hospital at three o'clock, when I knew the appeal had been filed. I said, "I feel better. I wanna go back to prison, to my cell, thank you." And that's what they did. And an appeal meant that it would be 15 years before they could deport me back to Belize. Well, it was not in Guatemala's interest to keep me in prison for that many years, so I was deported to the States, which is what I wanted. This afternoon, he boarded a flight back to Florida. [man] Amid a media frenzy, Guatemalan police forced him aboard a U.S.-bound flight. [woman] Software developer John McAfee has returned to the United States. [man] The software pioneer is still wanted for questioning in the murder of an American citizen in Belize, but he's free for now. And at the moment, he's still not charged with any crime. I cannot help but feel that he enjoyed, in his mind, playing the role of kind of a puppet master. He had a plan, and he was orchestrating that plan. What's a better story? Millionaire mad man on the run. But you saved my [bleep]. Why? 'Cause you paid attention to the story. Because you acted like a mad man? I did, and it worked. [Art] It's something that I guess I have to learn to realize that it's something that I can't do anything about. I can't rectify it. I can't solve it. I can't punish anybody. I can't do anything except regret the loss of my son. And, uh-- I don't know what else to say about it. [Nanette] Mm-hmm. Is it DNA tested? We do not have the level of forensic expertise to prosecute a crime like that. - [Nanette] Right. - That is a matter of fact. We've barely begun to touch fingerprinting, that sort of thing. And our murder/conviction rate is below 3%. - [Nanette] Really? - No. [Nanette] And who was at John's house at the time? [Nanette] Mm-hmm. [Nanette] Cash had not been easy to find. Because he didn't want to be found. Finally, his friend Eddie Halliday urged him to talk to me. [laughs] - You know? - [Nanette] He was asking to put money in people's bank accounts? [Nanette] So, tell me about what happened with Greg Faull. [Nanette] What guy's account? [Samantha] I was with him the night when his neighbor got shot. He was with me in the room. Like, four in the morning, he was still there. [thunder booms] [golf cart motor trilling] [Nanette] And what was he like? You know, this, that. [Nanette] Any time in that period that Greg was killed, did you ever see Eddie Mac, or MAC-10 at the house? He wasn't there the night dog was poisoned. In morning he was there. I saw that guy-- this dark-skinned guy. MAC-10 they call him, yeah. I only saw him, like, just I got a glimpse of him. He was in the hall talking to him. And I just came in, got a juice, and I went back in the room. [Nanette] Did you ever see him again? No, I never saw him again. [Nanette] To do what? You know, to kill the guy. [Nanette] Did the police ever question you about the murder of Greg Faull? Well, you know-- You know? [Nanette] I was trying to find Eddie McKoy to ask him about these new allegations. Eventually, he agreed to meet me a second time. What new information do you have for me? [Nanette] Well, I've looked into that. Okay, all right. Where were you when Greg Faull was killed? So can you tell me the real story? So around that time, did John ask you to do something and give you any money? Like $5,000? - [Nanette] Mm-hmm. - No. - [Nanette] No? - No, never. [Nanette] Why are you smiling? - [Nanette] No? - No. [Nanette] So you didn't get $5,000 wired into your account? So some people said they saw you that night. And--and you went to John's house. No. - Oh, no. Never. - [Nanette] Never? - Never. - [Nanette] Okay. [Nanette] So you were not hired by John - to kill Greg Faull? - No, no. Never. [Nanette] And if you were, would you tell me? No, I--well-- [Nanette] Mm-hmm. All right-- [Nanette] So I-- I'm just trying to understand why someone would say this. - [Nanette] I cannot tell you. - Okay. [Nanette] Did you have an alibi? So...

[Nanette] It looked like John had lived the full fantasy of an ugly American living large in a poor Central American country. He had apparently gotten away with possible murder and rape, buying the police, buying young women, indulging in bizarre, degrading sex, all seemingly without consequence. So I gotta keep the public interested in me, right? - Yep. - Well, I can do it by doing any number of things. Being a bad guy, being a good guy, being a fool, being all three at once. Uh, whatever it takes. He goes from running away from something to now running for. And in this case, he wanted to be President of the United States. [woman] Antivirus software industry pioneer, John McAfee, throwing his hat into the 2016 presidential ring. Have you actually filed yet, and have you started to raise money? I filed the papers on Tuesday. Uh, I'm officially running, yes, ma'am. We all know he likes attention. Okay, so, at any point in time, if he's not getting as much media attention as he would like, then he'll absolutely do something outrageous, say something outrageous, post something outrageous. Spy cameras are hidden in cactuses. The government surreptitiously parses our verbal communications. And the concept of privacy is fast approaching extinction. Running for president is pretty outrageous. Mr. McAfee, as president, what would you do about ISIS? ISIS is a problem of intelligence gathering more than anything else. I mean, we have the capacity-- certainly-- is anybody doing terrorist acts inside of China? Or inside of Russia? No, it just doesn't happen. They are so far ahead of us from a cybersecurity standpoint, meaning, intelligence gathering in the modern age. [applause] [Nanette] While John was running for president, the investigation into Greg Faull's murder continued. In early 2016, the Belizean police force asked the FBI for assistance. This allowed FBI agents to investigate and potentially try the case in the United States if they were able to collect enough evidence. Tonight, there is a report that Amy Emshwiller, one of McAfee's girlfriends at the time, has been detained for questioning in the murder of Faull. She was picked up by the police, who have been working with the FBI to crack the homicide. [phone line trilling] - [Santiago] Hello? - [Nanette] Hi, Santiago. It's Nanette. I was just checking in to see if there's been any progress since you interviewed Amy and-- - [Nanette] Eddie McKoy? - [Santiago] Yeah. [Nanette] I couldn't believe that John's girlfriend also fingered Eddie McKoy. It echoed what Cash told me. But without a DNA test to match the fingernail, there's not enough evidence to make any arrests. They would have to find Eddie to see if his DNA matched. A few days later, Eddie emailed me. He's leaving Belize. For good. So why are you leaving? [Nanette] Someone shot at you in your home? [Nanette] Does it have anything to do with John? Or is it entirely separate business?
