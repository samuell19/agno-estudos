Patch Kelly? - It's Patch Christ now. (dings) - [crowd] Patch Christ, Patch Christ, Patch Christ, Patch! - What is Patch Christ? - It's something new. - It's unchartered. - It a way of life. - It's heavy man. - It's Patch Christ. - [Patch] I'll explain it all to you later. - I feel so much better, you don't know how long it's been, since I've had a shower. - What were you doing wallowing in the mud then? - I don't know I just lost my will to live, all the drugs and alcohol just life in the fast lane. When the band broke up, I didn't know what to do. But now that you've found me, I want to start again. I want a fresh start. - Patch Christ, I just got back from the pawn shop. I hocked my mother's wedding ring, and I forged my father's pay check. - And this is all? Where's the car? Did you get the car? - My folks were against it. - Here take this, you know what to do. - My parents? - Go ahead, it's for Jesus. - It all came back to me slowly, my true identity. Kitty Kariall, one time leader of the Lovedolls, the baddest chicks in rock n roll. At my side Patch Kelly, drummer, and now religious cult leader. Six feet below us, ex Lovedoll, ex metal goddess, Bunny Tremelo. Bunny, I can't believe she's dead. Well Bunny if there's a rock n roll heaven, I'm sure you're jamming with the best. How can we go on without her? - Yeah but you know, guitar players are a dime a dozen. Come on Kitty, the Lovedolls were number one, we can do it again, with or without Bunny. - I'm not sure if I want that life. I made it to the top once and it nearly destroyed me. - What's the matter with you? You want to spend the rest of your life, living out of a shopping cart? We could be on top again, we could be drinking champagne instead of night train. (rock music) - Patch who were all those strange people in your house, and what were they doing? - You mean my followers? - Your followers? How did you get all those people, to cater to your every whim? - It was easy, they're all ex Lovedoll's fans, and after the band broke up, they still needed someone to worship, so I stepped in. After a while being an ex rockstar wasn't enough, so I thought up the religion angle. I figured if a wanna be rockstar like Charles Manson, could do it why not me? - Don't you think that's kinda sick? - Not really. Hey punk rockers vomit on their favorite musician, to show their appreciation, what's wrong with killing your parents for rock n roll? You did it. - [Radio] This is Dr. Scrotum talking at you, on radio station KAKA, rockin southern California, coming up next an old one from the Lovedolls. - Lovedolls? - I can't believe they're still playing this shit. - I can't either, oh my god. - You know if they're still playing us on the radio, it wouldn't be that hard for us to make a comeback. - A comeback?

While my brother dwelled in the dime way sent of Hollywood, I lived in serenity at the Freedom school in New Mexico where other wayward kids such as myself learned how, to live as one with the land and in complete inner peace. The school was ran by a beautiful woman named Jeannie who spent her time teaching the children ancient ways of the Navajo Indians passed down to her by her ex boyfriend Billy Jack. - These flowers will make a lovely dye, for that new dress Okia. - This flower is our lover. - Oh that's such a beautiful thought. - I know I really like to think flowers in love. - But why are some flowers open and others aren't? - Because flowers are like people, we all blossom at different times. ♪ All we are saying ♪ Is give peace a chance ♪ All we are saying ♪ Is give peace a chance ♪ All we are saying ♪ Is give peace a chance. (applause) - Ok kids, it's time for our rap session, does anyone have any thoughts they'd like to express, or share with us? Come on don't be shy. - I do Jeannie. - Ok. - It's hard for me to talk about but I found a bone arrow in my bed and I don't know, does that make me insane? (laughing) - Now kids don't laugh, don't laugh. Freebird you're a very sensitive and generous young man, on your quest and I think that was just a sign from the spirit and we should be positive about that. (applause) - Jeannie was an expert at helping us kids out with all of our problems. It wasn't til later that day I realized I had a problem and Jeannie was the only one that could help. Jeannie I know this might sound kinda silly. - Oh Rainbow you mustn't ever be afraid to express yourself. - I know. But you know what they say about the spiritual connection, between twins? - Of course. - Well me and my brother Johnny we were always really close, and I always felt that psychic connection you know. - That's beautiful. - Like, you know he moved to Hollywood, I know, I know the city it's horrible, but lately it seems as if the ties have been severed. - Really? - It's so distant, I don't know what to do. Jeannie I'm afraid I must go to the city. - Oh Rainbow, I wish you wouldn't choose that path, but it's really beautiful that you're willing to sacrifice, your own spiritual connection just for your brother. - I know that was a big decision for me. - But you must beware, the city is so dangerous. It's just so impure. Here, take this, Billy's great, great grandfather, Chief Chicken Hawk gave it to Billy, who gave it to me. It will protect you. - I will cherish this, I will. I will use this as a shield. - It has great powers, great powers. - Thank you so much. I'm gonna miss you and the kids so much. - They'll miss you too. Please be careful, remember all you've learned at the school. - Even though there was a possibility, we would never see each other again, Jeannie was very understanding of my destiny. She too could see the light reflecting off my inner mirror, so I said goodbye that day and prepared myself for the obstacles that could stand between my brother and myself. After all it was 666 miles to Los Angeles and the distance of this treacherous path was nowhere as satanic as the city that awaited me. (whooshing) (quiet rock music) - [Announcer] The white zone is for the immediate unloading and loading of passengers only, no parking. (Spanish announcement) (squealing) - Yes is Tanya there?

(rock music) - I used to be a rainbow now I'm bacterial warfare, and I want revenge. That's all I need revenge. I'm gonna make you bleed, I'm tired of being a hippie. (grunting) - You fucking. Who you fucking with boy? You don't fuck with the Lovedolls. - Oh I know that now, I came to seek vengeance for my brother man. - What the fuck is this? - [Kelly] Who are you? - I'm Rainbow remember? - Love your new look dude. - Well I came back to get vengeance, but now I realize the Lovedolls are the toughest, even more so than Suicidal. - Have you considered singing for a punk band? I'm getting this all boy punk band together, Anarchy Sixx and you would perfect as the lead singer. What do you say, want to give it a try? - Well, sure. - [Alexandria] Yeah we need your band to open for us on tour, you'd be perfect. - Yeah a hardcore band would be an excellent way for me to convey my art to the public. - [Kelly] Totally. - [Patch] Well come on you guys lets go score that shroom. - [Alexandria] Yeah let's get the dust, come on. - So things worked out pretty cool, the Lovedolls weren't so bad at all, and before I knew it I was playing to sold out shows at L.A. four.

My old man hit me yesterday for the last time, selling mommy's valine at school. Now I'm crashing on Hollywood boulevard. Yeah, I'm crashing down real hard. Hanging out on a strip waiting for my next fix, man this is the life for me. Stoned, and loose, and sweet 16. I grew up fast in juvie hall, by the time I was 14 I'd seen it all. Bed knobs and broomsticks and that's not all, my boyfriend OD'd on beer and ludes. They found him face down in the bathroom at school - [Man] Mr. President, Lovedolls on line one. - Hello girls, this is your president speaking, I just wanted to congratulate you on your forum date, 55,0000 people sold out, with a gross like that you're gonna shoot right up there, with Rambo in no time. - Great that's incredible, oh by the way Alexandria discovered this hot new punker band. They're called Anarchie Sixx, yes they're gonna open the shows up for us. - Hey but what about that outer space tour? - Tour? Oh, oh, the intergalactic tour, seven out of nine planets are confirmed, you know girls this is a great way to spread the word that America's back and show a little patriotic spirit, you know. We've even tie dyed the space shuttle for the occasion. - Tell them to make Tripper Gore comes through with the buzz, it'll be hard to score flying in outer space. - Oh no problem, no problem, NASA has cooked up an experimental space dust for all your, nutritional needs. But one thing ma'am, back here on earth, your ah fan club as you affectionately call it, is continuing to stir up a lot of damaging, and negative publicity. - Yes, they've been just getting a little out of hand. - Yeah they've been really blowing it, I hear they've been spray painting Lovedolls on the houses, of their victims. - The press has been blowing this all out of proportion, I mean we don't tell them to kill just anyone, we use them with discretion. - Yeah. - Well girls, girls our final solution to the problem, should harken back to an important figure in our history, I hope you remember from your school work. You ever hear of Reverend Jim Jones? That's correct People's Temple. - Well I say it's about time we ditched those creeps. - You know this should be just the kind of news story we need, to show all those silent majority folks out there listening in on the satellite dishes that we're on the case against those upstart religious cults, and showing them our deterrent to terrorism. - But they should be honored to die for such a worthy cause, as our new clean cut image. - Yeah, well we're making millions of bucks, we can find new fans. - Yeah. - Attention, members of the Lovedolls fan club, Kitty Karriall's speaking. Be at the caves this afternoon, we're throwing a big going away party, for you. As you know we're going into space, and we have a 2001 year contract and of course we can't take you all with us. We just want to show our admiration, and now you can test your ultimate devotion. See you there. (chattering) (pouring) - I hear this stuff just keeps you in agony for 20 minutes before it kills you - It's going to be so funny. - I heard people turn blue and they swell up. - Now for the magic, I'll put this in first. That'll do. - Where'd you get that anyhow? (chattering) - You think it's ready yet? - It smells pretty potent. - Hey Sadie, Isiah! Alright I want a single file line, don't worry there's enough for everybody, lots of it in there. Have some more, have some more. - [Kitty] Here you go there's plenty for you all, drink up, drink up. Here you go. - [Voiceover] That's a little strong, not like how mom made. (chattering) (vomiting) (horrified music) (groaning) (buzzing of flies) - So the day finally came, and we hopping to space, couldn't have came at a better time though, especially since we'd just done off with the entire, Lovedolls fan club. Yeah that's pretty narly, people on earth didn't think so, they were getting kind of bummed out. Well anyways it was really cool, and they gave us big space shuttle and everything, and the president even called up to say, bon voyage, yeah I told the dude to fuck off, and hung up the phone. Yeah he was really moted. Anyways I heard they got this really hardcore scene on Mars, yeah I'm looking forward to it. Think I'm probably going to get a mohawk. - Reporters at gate C five. - Is this the secret entrance to the space shuttle? - No comment. - Is this where the Lovedolls are being boarded? - Please stand clear this is a security zone. I'm telling you, you're not coming through. I've never even heard of the Lovedolls. (yelling) - [Patches] Captain's log star date 2001 a.d. the reporters and fans lined for miles to witness the blast off. Fortunately the press conference delayed the original space shuttle flight, it was a challenge but NASA supplied us with our very own L.S. three D Lovedoll rocket ship. It was a little breezy but we all enjoyed the view. After all with chemical warfare behind the wheel, we knew we were in for one spaced out trip. - Ok ladies prepare for take off. - Outer space here we come! - Yeah! - I heard the dudes on the moon are stone foxes. - Cool. - Alright, blast off. - [radio] Lift off, we have lift off. ♪ Superstar Lovedoll superstar ♪ Superstar Lovedoll superstar ♪ I don't know why they left us ♪ Oh god, where did they go ♪ But they'll be back you know ♪ They can't leave us this way ♪ Patch found jesus, Bunny was hit ♪ Kitty quit life 'cause she was through with it ♪ But we will pray and know they will get together someday ♪ Superstar, lovedoll superstar ♪ Superstar, lovedoll superstar ♪ It seems one day Patch discovered ♪ Kitty Kariall asleep in the gutter ♪ She grabbed her back and said she'd like to do it again ♪ Fame and fortune nearly killed me ♪ We can't go on without Bunny ♪ But Alex is back ♪ and she's been off drugs for nearly a year ♪ No one can stop us now so you don't even try ♪ You can't kill a lovedoll, babe ♪ 'cause superstars, they don't die ♪ Superstar, lovedoll superstar ♪ Superstar, lovedoll superstar
