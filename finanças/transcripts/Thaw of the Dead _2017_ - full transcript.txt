As you know, we're doing an investigative segment on the reported leak of fracking waste into our great lakes. It's important to get reliable information from the EPA, local governments, really anybody, but what we do know is a rapidly growing list of beaches and waterways have been closed. Fishing is unilaterally banned and there's a very concerning rise in illnesses near these spills. Some in the medical community believe that the fracking sludge has triggered a bacteria boom which environmental groups have dubbed frack-teria. And it's this frack-teria that's causing the illness. Now, you're not gonna believe this, but not only is there a local representative of Bigly Oil and Gas, a major stakeholder in probably the direct cause of these leaks. I managed to get him on the phone for a few questions. Let me bring him on. Hello, Mr. Volmond are you there? Uh, yeah, yeah, but not for much longer if you keep me waiting like that again. Thank you for waiting, thank you. Let's jump right in. Can you tell me, why does Bigly use fracking exclusively... Well that's simple, fracking produces two things in abundance: jobs and oil. A whole ton of oil. Now listen, I'm no economist, but I know that there are two things there's never too much of, okay? Jobs and oil. Okay, Mr. Volmond, on a personal level, if it turns out that this illness is connected and more people get sick and even die, would you still advocate for fracking? Listen, a wise woman once said, and this is something that quite honestly shaped my life, she said, "drill baby drill." And what if your wife gets sick? Or your children? Will you continue to drill? Listen lady, I'll be saying drill even after the cows come home. I'll be saying drill baby drill, even after hell freezes over and the dead walk the earth, it's that simple, okay? Look, I don't know why you liberals hate oil. Why you liberals hate jobs... The following message is being transmitted at the request of the CDC and Office of Homeland Security.

We should go. Come on baby. Get in, hurry up. Hurry up, hurry up. Go. Where's Devon? Where's Devon? Mary! Just go, please, Wane go. What. Pal... Not leaving without him. What the hell's wrong with you? Just please, just go. Please. Christ, wait here. He's dead! What? He's dead. Pal, uh... Ridiculous. Wait here. - No, you can't! - No! No! Get the door! Go, go. Go go go go go go go! So where are we going? I mean shouldn't we be going to like a fallout shelter. Police station? Some place where people are gathering? This morning the news said to go to the high school. They're setting up a shelter. They said it would be safe, that there'd be doctors. They also said stay inside and you'll be fine. That hasn't panned out real well. Where are we? Where are we? We're in the middle of nowhere. Look, guy, we need to turn this thing around right now and head back to my condo like I said. 24 hour security, armed security guard, gated community. I mean, it's got a spa on the roof, you can get a massage any time of the day with the hot rocks. You ever had the hot rock treatment? It's incredible. They put the cucumbers on your eyes, everything. You would not believe what this place is like. You would not believe what I paid for this thing. Of course you wouldn't. Wane? The waiting list was huge, and I was able to pull some strings. I called in a few favors. This place is beautiful, I mean, it's got this private beachfront property... Shut, your, face. Wane please. We're getting out of town. Fewer people, fewer problems, presumably. I know a place. This is, this is great. This is just great. Are you kidding me? Are you kidding me? Are you kidding me? Seriously? We passed like three gas stations back there. There is still no signal out here. Now what genius? Let's get outta here. Where are you going? There is a house right there. There is people right there. Hey, hey! Shut the hell up. Where, where are you people going? Where are you going, we're gonna freeze out here. Come on lady, you've got a kid. What are you gonna do, sleep in the woods? This is great, yeah. I mean you're gonna freeze to death. What are you, are you stupid? You go back there, you're dead. It's your choice. Got the turbines back online. You were right. There's power? Yeah, there's power. Had to rewire a few things. Wane, what's going on? I don't know. It's not good. June? She's inside with a few others. I'm putting the crowbar right here. Wait there, move together. I think I see something. Don't go in, dammit, almost done here. Oh score. Hey what the hell man? I told you to wait. Clear all these rooms? Ha ha! Look, score! Whatcha got? Corn. Hey get off me! Help, help! Get it off me! Come on Dave, pull away. Not a good trade. You don't have to tell me, I had to watch him die. I have no idea how he got so careless. It doesn't matter. And he was the last one willing to go out. I'll go myself. I'd rather do that anyway. You can't, we can't afford it. We lose you, all our chances diminish drastically. You don't know that. I do know that and so do you. Come on. So what else are you gonna do? Sit around and watch each other starve, waiting for someone to die so you can eat? No, we need to consider our options, expediting the process. Expediting the process? What do you mean? A lottery. That's insane, no. It's not up to you. No one's gonna go for that. Maybe. You might be surprised. Bullshit. It would save the group for weeks. You might be surprised how far some of us would go to save the others. Those things out there don't care about life. They aren't even human anymore. You do this, you'll make us just like them, the same. And for what, a week, two? Nah, no way. He has to choose. He knows. Then make him. Make him choose. Dan. It's okay baby. You'll be fine. It's gunna be Okay. Wow, it really is this empty. You're not supposed to be in here. I uh, I thought you'd wanna know, he took the crowbar. I think he's going out. Look, don't you think we should draw again? I mean she has a kid. It's done. I know, but it shoulda been one of us not her. For this to work, everyone has to share the risk. Everyone. It doesn't matter that she has a child. It's done. Now move, so I can lock up. We're already seeing more outside. Temperature's been up two, three weeks now. The one's locked in the ice are probably out roaming again. This going the way you thought? Everyone voting. If you call that a vote. with the others it was natural causes and I can almost understand that. This? This is different. Much different. We tried it the other way. You know we lost more going out than we do now staying inside, safe. Safe? You think that little girl's... You think anyone's ever gonna feel safe here again? After this? You know this is wrong. You all do. Mother and daughter is| something worth protecting. I know. That's why I'm not gonna stop you. There's a town all the way to the coast. Maybe it's been forgotten. Just keep to the river for god's sake. Don't need your advice. Don't need anything from you. Just your word, on your life, - you swear to me - swear to me You'll follow the rules. Swear to me you won't run. She has 'til sunset tomorrow, not a second before. You'll come back. It's important to me that you survive. We all need you. Things will change. They have to. You have to survive. Silvia has got to survive. We do whatever it takes so that one of us has a future. Hey, hey help! Hey! Run, get to the bridge! They're all around you, come on! Hey wait! Wait, help! Jump, come on! It's the only way, come on! Wait! Wait help! What are you doing, come on jump! God help me! How much food would he have to get? I'm sorry honey, what? How much food's enough so they won't take you away? I don't know baby. Wane'll do his best, but you know how hard it's been to find anything. Well like, 20 cans? 20 cans would be really good. But there's a chance that he won't find anything. He'll find something. He may not make it back in time. He always comes back. I know. But he only has a couple of days. We need to start preparing ourselves for the chance that he won't... and what that means. I know what it means. You'll be gone, Wane will be gone, and I'll be alone. Yes. And you'll have to be strong. I don't think I'll stay here. How's he doing? He's a lost cause. Don't say that. Wane always comes back with something. Maybe some medicine, maybe penicillin. He's not coming back. Of course he's coming back. Why would he? I mean think about it. He's better off without us. We're just dead weight. Just weighing him down. You know, if it were me, I'd head out to Milos Islands while the lakes are still frozen. Guess we're lucky it's not you. He would never leave Mary and Silvia. They were friends before this happened. He worked with her husband. What difference does it make? Wait. Just wait a second, wait. Think about it. Think about what? He's dead either way. You know it, you know it, I know it, we all know it. But this, this is stupid, this is just stupid. We're feeding a dead man while the rest of us starve. Out of my way. No no no no no, wait a second, wait a second. If he dies, then... He's right. It'd be, it'd be a mercy. A mercy, exactly, exactly. It'd be a mercy, yeah. You mean, for Mary? Yeah, yeah for Mary. For all of us. They left you here to freeze. Or worse. They'll be back. By then, you'll either be frozen meat or they'll cut you loose for sport. Help. Yeah, against my better judgment. Who d'you got there? AJ? Alistair Jensen. The boy was never right, not even before. Can you walk. Yeah. Good. Thank you. Thanks for the clothes. That's a hell of a story. Judgment, might just be a choice between bad and worse. Traverse City? Too dangerous. Dangerous. More dangerous than your friends at the dam? Sounds to me like if you don't come back with something pretty soon... That poor woman. There's nothing in town. All the houses have been looted, three, four times. Choices. Nothing but bad choices in this nightmare, nobody wins. Certainly not this old fisherman. You're fine. Been fighting it for a few days now. Just can't fight it much longer. I'm sorry. Sorry. God's sorry, the angels are sorry, hell the whole world's sorry, but here we are. I don't know what to... You and I are gonna strike an accord. I'm gonna help you load the canoe with all the stuff I've salvaged. It'll be enough to save your friends, at least for a little while. And in exchange... you're gonna end this for me. Burn my body to ash on the beach. Okay. That's far enough. Won't take 'em long. God this used to be so beautiful. You save some gas? You take what you need, but you burn me. To ashes, all the way. Nothing left. You need to finish it that way. Enough pussy-footin' around. Take that. Take it. It was a blessing, you coming here. It's time. No the sun hasn't set. No. You said the sunset, he still has time. I'm sorry. They've already started. Eat. This is your share. You have to eat to survive. We all need to, now more than ever. You came back. Thank god. It was awful. They didn't wait. He was still breathing. We have to go.
