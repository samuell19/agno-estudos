Darling about - if you'll all excuse me what is it look now yes staying here daddy talk a minute Bessie mr. darling I realize it must have been quite a blow to you when your daughter married me and as that's natural enough I think you got an answer coming and here it is we've been married a year now and it's it's been a pretty tough year for cake ranching's no game for her and I think I made a big mistake in letting her try it what I'm getting that is if it won't work out on the ranch I'm gonna work it out someplace else this circus or or any place because Kay's in love with me and I'm in love with Kay and I don't think nothing can ever break it and so I'd say mr. darling that you is pretty lucky because underneath it all all you really want is for her to be happy and if she loves me I'm gonna find a way of making her happy and and that's all I got to say right what I'm getting that is if it won't work out on the ranch I'm gonna work it out someplace else this circus or or any place because. Kay's in love with me and I'm in love with Kay and I don't think nothing can ever break it and so I'd say mr. darling that you was pretty lucky because underneath it all all you really want is for her to be happy and if she loves me I'm gonna find a way of making her happy and and that's all I got to say. I forgot to tell you but some people dropping in tonight hope you like today well I'm Nonaka it doesn't matter.
