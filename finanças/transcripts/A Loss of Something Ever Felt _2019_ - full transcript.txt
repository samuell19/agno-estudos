Hi, Mom. I decided to write, even though I didn't want to. Everything around me seems pointless. Nothing interests me. During the last month I was using heroin and cocaine 24h a day. I had everything in my backpack, at all times. Syringes, a spoon and so on... Everything you need to shoot up. I wasn't thinking at all. Heroin was the only thing. During the nights, I stole. Sometimes during the day too. I got caught during a crazy heist. Heroin destroys your brain cells. I made a mistake again. My will to live is gone. - No, no, no! - You have to line up. Guys, have you seen this man anywhere... He's a foreigner. Affirmative, he comes by here... from time to time. It's one of the largest drug dens. We have to go to the place you wanted during the week, at night... Because in the area you you told me he was, they leave to get money during the day, and come back at night. There is nothing we can do. There is no one to contact. He chose his own path. If a person escapes to another country... He didn't escape! I don't know what else to do. So, it's impossible to get any help? If he doesn't want any help how can you help him? What if he's dead? Maybe something happened to him? Maybe he needs help? He's always been in contact. Six months ago, he called me at least every ten days. I haven't heard from him in six months. Something could have happened! Of course it could have. Then you have to file a report with the local police in Colombia. How? If I don't speak the language and don't know how to contact them? The closest Honorary Consulate is in Brazil... What language can I... We don't pay the Honorary Consuls. He will do everything he can to make sure you don't find him. Don't worry about that. I worry because I can't keep living like this. I can't go on without knowing the location of one Estonian citizen. To you he is nobody. To me, he's my son. There was a file named Hille and Lauri here. This is Eeva. It's mine. Mother, it's mine! Mom, I checked it yesterday. There is nothing of Lauri's in there. And yours? My birth certificate? I have to remember where I put it. I think I have it scanned. This is your letter to him. No, that's Lauri's. Put it here. The time in Venezuela was the worst. He got three years there. I told him it was too risky. People die swallowing those capsules. He had to take it to Spain, where the exchange was to happen. He was captured at the airport, just before heading back to Europe. When he returned from Venezuela, he destroyed everything at home. He said he wasn't going back to prison. That he had no prospects in Estonia and wanted to live abroad. I asked him where he wanted to go. To Colombia, he said. I guess he saw that I would take care of all his problems. I was able to keep him out of prison until he turned 20. But for what? So I bought him the plane tickets. Through Madrid and Caracas. But he was blacklisted in Venezuela. The final destination was Bogotá, but he jumped off the plane during a stopover in Cali. He was so unpredictable. So he stayed in Cali. The only information we have is that mom used to send money via Western Union. As my brother had no documents, the money was collected by local contacts. We can't access regular transactions. The police can only help if he's gone missing recently. And if we knew exactly where. Can you imagine an Estonian pensioner going to Colombia to file a police report? She said they can't help because we don't know the address. I didn't think he would go there and disappear. I thought he would come back. Maybe he has fake documents by now? They might find a complete stranger with his documents... That's completely possible. We haven't considered that because Lauri's passport is gone for a long time. Maybe something is happening under his passport. But I'm telling you, that considering that Estonia is a developed country, somewhat, you see how uncoordinated all these different government organisations are. In Colombia, I wouldn't be positive at all. I'm sure that most of the time we are sent to this office, to this office, this office... They don't know anything. And the information is very slowly... passed. So we have to have patience the most. Patience. He usually called once a week. He didn't ask for money every time. We talked about the weather, what he was up to. That he was in rehab, had a job and was feeling better. He talked about a man called Matias, the only person who didn't take advantage of him. Then, one day, he said he was bored and wanted to go to Bogotá. And then the requests for money began. There was a group of people who called often. At 2 AM, the phone rang with a +68 area code. A man introduced himself, asked for money, said Lauri is in the hospital and needs money for rehab. He asked for 2000 euros. I told him I won't send it unless I talk to Lauri. I called that man back to talk to Lauri, but he always said: "Tomorrow". I don't know what is going to happen now. So much depends on Eeva. This is my favourite one. I look so proud. Proud of your big brother? Maybe I was just happy because he was leaving the house. You started swimming quite early. I learned quickly because Lauri kept trying to drown me. You mastered diving before swimming. In this one, I'm following him willingly. All I remember is you worked during the week, and on Fridays. Lauri and I took the chairs to the road and waited there until you came. Sometimes we waited for the whole day... I remember that too. It was every Friday. And sometimes I came so late you had vanished from the chairs already. What a nice picture... My God... So happy, both of you... Look how nicely we still got along here. That's why it's so nice. I think we were, a lot of times, we were very alone. I was alone and he was alone or we were together alone. So we were kind of lone wolves. He was very often missing, sometimes whole nights. He would sometimes be gone for days. This was his kind of a hiding place. That nobody was taking him anywhere or forcing him to do things he did not like to do. That was the place to hide. So the police and mom and everybody would come here and they would show me to go in... and I would crawl around and kinda call his name and I would look and there was all these old mattresses and blankets and all these... things people have left behind. It's bizarre because it's kind of you think as a child that it shouldn't be a child's problem but somehow you also are the closest, at that time probably I was the closest because we spent so much time together. That somehow, even the grown-ups would rely on you to do something that... you know. - Have you seen the passports? - It's here. My name is Carlos Lesmes, I'm calling on behalf of Eeva Kaun. Lauri Poola's sister. A young Estonian who was there... Yes, did I speak with you recently? Ah, yes... Matias? Yes, yes... This is Matias speaking. Ok, this is your foundation... Ok, this is your foundation... So we saw Lauri's picture online and we're gathering information. - What is your name again? - Carlos Lesmes. Right, Carlos... Yes, that's the picture... from when he was here. I told you that I put it up. But the family, well, I never heard from them. No, the same... that the photo is from the time Lauri was in the foundation and whenever we are there, he is willing to talk to us and... - Okay, perfect. - Collaborate and so on. But like... exactly, like there's no new information He doesn't knew... doesn't know anything. Yeah, well, obviously, because he left Cali. Anything new so he is also just like, whatever... We probably know more than he does. I'm looking for my brother. His name is Lauri. Have you seen him? Don William, have you seen this man? Yes, I'm looking for my brother. No? You haven't seen him? Hello, Omar, how are you? Hello, Carlos, how's it going? Fine, thanks. Oh, okay. Carlos, pay attention, the idea is to spread the word among the street people that the family is looking for him. "Hey, some people are looking for a foreigner." Do you understand me? It's touchy... "and you should know we're looking for him to get him into recovery... and, if possible, to take him home." Look, he's her brother. Don't give out too many. Leave them with these people. The idea is to get into... the place where the dealers are. And tell the dealer, "Bro, they're looking for this guy." When you're doing drugs, the fact that you can lose everything... you just don't care. Because you're enjoying something you like. Drugs are delicious. They're bad, harmful, the worst there is, but they're really nice. So why are you trying to get them off the streets? No, no... That's why we only talk to those who are interested. They're looking for the ones who want... There are people who say, "No more! I've had it!" "I'm tired, I'm fed up with living on the street, doing drugs... I need a safe place." That's where we come in. But if the person doesn't want to, they'll never get out of there. So we have to be careful. The idea is to make sure we are safe. Take out a gun and bang, bang! "No, I just wanted a box of food." - Supposedly this guy knows him. - I know who he is. I saw him about five times. They called him "El Ñato". Big nose... and big ears... red... I used to live in that drainage ditch. I remember wondering maybe... eight months ago? We wondered about him and said, "That guy never came back here." Somebody else said: "He was here..." So it's true that I've seen him. Foreigners have asked for cocaine or 'blow'... And it turned out to be crack cocaine. And the crack got them addicted. The effect that crack has... It's like an orgasm. But once you ejaculate... then it's over. So you have to do more to to try to ejaculate. Nights go by and days go by... Why do you do it? Because the first crack you smoked made you orgasm. If you find him, we'll give you a reward. Because the family is looking for him. There's a reward. We're talking 50, 100 thousand pesos. Come by tomorrow and if I hear anything... What's his name? Check down there... In that ditch where he hangs out. That's where they are. Ñato? Ñato? How do you say nickname? Is anybody alive? Lauri? Lauri? Who's eating? Who wants to eat? Okay, we're bringing more down! No, no... The thing is, Pastor... If three or four of us go down, they can get aggressive and rude. Duvan just came up and said that things are tense down there. So only two went down with two of our colleagues. Is he there? What happened? - I need some meals to take down. - How many? About five or six. Brother, you know what? This is wonderful. But, look, I'm trapped. Come on out. Can we get you out? We'll give you a hand and get you out. Do you know why I won't come out? Pastor, with all due respect... I don't mean to offend you or anything... It's just that the devil is like that. He gets you into trouble. But I want to say just one thing: Thank you. What ID does he use here in Colombia? ID? He didn't have any papers. They were stolen in Cali. - He didn't have any papers. - What ID? No, no... Passport gone. He's undocumented. He's undocumented. That's also the problem. There's no record of him. You know what? Seven people go missing here in Colombia every day. We do not know if it's aliens... We have no idea. The Attorney General doesn't know... The CTI has no idea, the police don't know. The thing about street people is... We are quite high on a hill, with a great view of the city. It's a chaotic, enormous city. I can't imagine Lauri here, in this environment. So, you can't say anything now? It's still too early. The city looks so big from here, I can't imagine... The idea that I would accidentally bump into him on the streets is very unlikely. This is not Tallinn. That is clear. Anyone who says he knows Bogotá is a liar. There are parts of this city where you feel like a gringo. Do you like Bogotá? Do I like it? No, I don't. You have to work every day here. Like the snake charmer says: "Whether you take a shit or not, the laxative still costs you 2,000 pesos." Whether you have work or not, you have to pay your bills. Straight? You'll have a coffee, right? Nobody has offered me a coffee since I came to this house... Not since I arrived here. I haven't even gotten a coffee. I saw him yesterday. And about a month ago. Near Eduardo Santos. - They've seen him around there. - In Eduardo Santos. And about a month ago. I was with the guy and he said, "I'm not from Colombia. I'm a foreigner." He said, "Just look at my nose." But the guy is... He's living on the street now. He hangs out up and down South 24th Street. Around Quiroga, Olaya... No, before that. Before Olaya? - In Restrepo. Restrepo? - Yes. - We looked for him there a while ago. - Really? - We went down into the ditches. - Yes, I saw him down there. Yeah, the guy hangs out there. But do you know where he hangs out at night? Before you get to Restrepo, along 24th Street, there's a park... The guy sits in that park and does drugs. Yeah, he knows a foreign guy, from the area where we were. I don't remember, but it was a really weird name. - And what's his name? - What's his name? - Lauri. - Lauri? And he talks like, with a speech impediment... Like with a lisp or something? - Or did he speak normally... - No, normally. He speaks normally. - Did he have teeth? - But he has an accent, right? And he has teeth? I think so. Yes, he has teeth. - Then maybe it's not him. - If he has teeth... Her brother is toothless. Anyway, I couldn't tell you if he has teeth or not because we are surrounded by so many street people. When you're all messed up, you're not looking at whether some guy has teeth or not. He was a drug addict. He lived on the street, right? At that time, when he was on the street, did he want his family to find him? I'm going to speak to you as a former drug addict. You always carry them with you in your heart. The thing is, you have to realise that you're living in a very, very dark place. But the first thing you have to feel if you really want to change is that you really have to want it. So let's say we do find my brother, what should I do? Do you know what they said to me? They said, "You know what, Duvan? You're a man now, a grown-up, son. You're a man! Old enough to know better. You made your decision! So... get on with your life!" Right? Get on with your life! Did that help you? Of course! And do you know why? When they stopped supporting me, I really felt... alone. Alone. And when you feel alone, that's when... you realise that you won't be getting any money, nothing, no more little bits... The tap is turned off. It's over. That's when you get tired and that's when you say... "Hello? Help me! Now I really need your help!" When you help him financially you're killing him. Little by little. That's called 'co-dependency'. The money he receives, he won't use it to eat or to bathe, but to smoke crack. The best advice I can give you, and you won't want to hear it... Place your trust and your hope in God. It's hard, because you have two addicts at home. One is the drug addict, the other one is the addict who keeps feeding the drug addict. I'll give you an example: Your brother is affecting you. You, your emotions, your love... your obsession... He affects you. You see? It affects your mother. He affects your surroundings. Let's trust in God and that the information that the boy gave us is useful. You already did your part, what you had to do. You are doing what you have to. If you go home without finding him, go in peace. Why? You've done your part. We did have an argument over the phone with Lauri. I said: Lauri, this cannot last forever. Then he said: "I would come home, but where is my home?" I said: "I won't send you any more money, because you will only use it to buy drugs. Nothing will change if I don't change myself." Then he said: "I won't call you anymore". I asked: "Is that a threat or what?" I told him: "Lauri, I know you will call. You are that kind of person. You can't manage on your own." And then he asked: "Alright... Is that your final word?" "That you won't send any money anymore?" My sister sent the last money, because I was working in Finland that day. She sent him 300 EUR. And that was the last time I heard from him. Yeah, when we first started I really thought... that I just come here and I am gonna go to morgue and identify a body, but now, if I listen to Omar it is... I am not so sure anymore. I guess that he could be around. Hi mommy! Oh my God, I was so frightened, I thought Lauri was calling. Oh... I'm calling from Skype. My heart almost stopped! I'm sorry... I haven't had a call from such a number for a long time... Sorry, I thought you might think that. But you're not on Skype, so what can I do. I was told that Lauri had been found. They showed me his picture, but it clearly wasn't him. The guy had a totally different face. But to the locals, all Europeans look similar. You see? They can't tell the difference. Yeah, they can't distinguish between white men. But he has scars in his face. Maybe he has a beard now... Or the scars are so common here... Maybe in Estonia people notice them but here they don't pay much attention to scars. Have you heard anything about Europeans who have been found dead? It's not so easy to access that information. First, we have to file a missing persons report with the police. And then we get access to the unidentified people found dead or killed. They probably have a database for that. Ah, yes. Then you have to do that. Ok, Mom, I'll keep you posted. Good luck at the dentist tomorrow. - Alright. Let's remain hopeful. - Of course. - Hugs to you. - You too. Kisses! There's no record of anyone with that name and surname. We collect information on undocumented persons through an interview. Please note that the person who will help you will ask for all that information. So that during the interview they can verify the information. So, now, we'll do the interview. As I explained, it lasts about 45 minutes. So this interview is also the missing persons report? Yes, that's true. The interview is the report. Here in Bogota, what we do is... There's a system, which functions inter-institutionally. We report the disappearance of everyone, from all over the country, and also those who died a violent death. In other words, everything that the Coroner's Office handles. But, what about if they die of a drug overdose? A violent death is any death due to non-natural causes. Any unnatural death is a violent death. It could be an overdose, a suicide... anything. A traffic accident... They're all violent deaths. After we file the report, we go on to... photo verification of unidentified corpses. So, after we finish the report we'll - take a look at the photographs. - Today? - It's part of the process. - Oh, crap. Remember, the pictures are of fresh corpses, right? The ones that can be shown. The decomposed bodies won't be here. I just watched dead bodies and trying to think if the next page is going to be my brother or not. But, it's part of the process and we needed the report. Most likely nothing happens, even with this report. Anyway they said we should come back before we leave and take another look... And I don't think the police is going to find him. They take the file, like Estonian Police, they say "yes, we do our best". They put it in their folder, they put it in their drawer and that's it. They're not gonna go and look for him on the streets. So this police thing it's just a formality, it's useless. We all know that. That they are not going to find Lauri. Even if they... in their head they think that they will, but they won't find him. Because they don't have resources. Seven people gets missing in Bogota every day. That's just one of them. It's just statistics. How's it going, all good? Do you want to go to the shelter? Wanna go to the shelter right now? To get some rest... To take advantage of the shelter? I'd also like to ask you a question, sorry. Have you seen this guy around here anywhere? Okay, thanks. How long ago... was it a long time ago? Six months. You'll find this guy around Plaza España. Plaza España? Okay. So he looks familiar? - Yeah, sure, I've seen him. - When did you see him last? About how long ago was it? - I'd say two or three days ago. - Two or three days? Two or three days. Thank you. We're looking for him. Thank you very much, man. I saw him in Las Lomas. I'm from Las Lomas. - And where is Las Lomas? - Up on the hill above Quiroga. - Above Quiroga, right? - In the drug dens around Las Lomas. - They also called him "El Ñato" maybe... - Gringo. I call him gringo. Gringo is like a white person. Yeah, like a gringo. He's the father of my children. I'm looking for him too. He's not called Alan? - His name is Lauri. - Should've said Lauri, bro. El Ñato? Gringo? - More to the north... - Towards 26th Street. Towards the north. - Thanks a lot. - Thanks, man. It doesn't have any logic. He's lived like this, probably all his life, he's been to prison in Venezuela... You know, he's been in these countries before. He's lived on the street, roughly. He's been in prison maybe twenty times in his life. So, why now? Why would he cut that tie? The idea that he lives like normally on a street being a drug addict and being an alcoholic, and not being part, you know... the resource that my mom has. It makes no sense at all. I'm sorry, I know that we all want to wish that he was in rehab and he was having a job but... It's not about the wish, it's about the possibilities. Yes... I cannot see that possibility. Most likely he had an overdose and he forgot his own name and phone number. That's what happened. Or he is another person. As I said, my will to live is gone. I imagine it's not the nicest thing to read, but this is how it is. Unfortunately. That's what my life has become. I've let it happen, especially recently. People say: "All roads lead to Rome." Mine barely gets to Warsaw. If the court gives me a sentence to be carried out in Estonia, then it's 100% sure - I will never come to Estonia again. I'll try to finish this letter on a more hopeful note. Maybe I'll get out in a year. Then there's still some hope. I'll quit drugs. I got ten days of methadone, here in prison. My body is clean. At least some of my brain cells have started to work again. If I get out in a year, then I'll constantly tell myself - zero drugs. And keep that promise. There's no space to it. Not because they're bad people, but because there's no space in their heads. Ok, you have guests. We are celebrating Lauri's birthday together with Urve. Congratulations, Mom. We just had a bottle of champagne. I probably drank more than Urve. How do I look? A bit tipsy, I would say. I'm so pale that I don't look drunk. I got sunburnt yesterday. Can you see? Lauri turned 39, didn't he? Right? Yes. Maybe he did something to himself? Otherwise he'd still be asking for money through the locals... I can't even think... But you still try to keep the hope and optimism for her. For her sake. I don't know. At least if we find out some answer it will be easier for her. If we go back without anything that will be the hardest. So we have to find out something. One way or the other we have to get the answer. Come on, we need to find this man. If you help me find him, I'll give you a good reward. His family is looking for him. Doing all they can. If he is here, he is living in the streets and he is so soaked through with drugs that he has lost all sense of reality. He literally lives in trash and shit. Those are not nice neighbourhoods, mother. There is nothing comparable in Tallinn or in Estonia. Because there's thousands of them. I've seen such shit in Estonia too. No mom, you have not. Just the amount of people sleeping on the streets - we've never seen that in Estonia. It's very hard for me to walk on those streets. They are all lying under blankets... You try to make eye contact and communicate with them... Most of them are completely high. He told me: "Mom, it's not your fault. This is just how I am. Don't blame yourself." He said he lost the will to live, because nothing would change in Estonia. "I don't dare walk around there, beauty is just too important in Estonia." "I'm afraid of my acquaintances and friends." I understood it was easier for him to be far away from here. Beauty is not so important there. He asked me: "Mother, where can I live? I've hit rock bottom." I told him stories about people who got out from the bottom. They started their lives again. The change has to come from you. I can't make miracles happen and buy you a better life. You have to do it yourself. Lack of money was never an issue. I could build another house if I wanted to. He blamed me for building a house for Eeva. "It's true. But Lauri, you were the reason for doing it. Your house, Lauri, has run through your veins. With all of your troubles that I paid for. I haven't built that house yet." Hey guys, sorry that I... I just got a call from one of the guys from the... district and they're saying they just... they just saw Lauri. - They saw Lauri? - Well, they think so. So... maybe we should just go? I want you to go and talk to him. No, no, no... when you go there... and if it's Lauri. I should talk to him? Well, yeah, if he wants to talk. He might not want to talk. You know, and then tell me if it's him or not. Because I think that he might get angry if I go first. He might get angry if I go first. And if it's not him, I'm not sure I want to continue the search. It's emotionally too tiring. I... I just... I don't know... It's not about finding him or not, it's the responsibility you have to take for him then. Now my heart is beating. If mom wants to take care of him, then she should come here herself. And take that responsibility if she wants to. You have the picture there? My partner is not answering. We are at 17 with 15. I need Yanira to come. I saw him in the separator. He was sleeping on 19th street next to the road. He has a gray blanket with tigers. He has a gray blanket with tigers. He spoke good Spanish? How was his Spanish? Good? - He has an accent! - He has a thick accent. - But his Spanish was very good. - But he speaks Spanish. - But next time, I won't wake him. - Did he have teeth? I will call you, so you can wake him up. Because he's going to leave and he'll be gone. Next time, let us know. We'll meet you and go with you. - Did he have teeth? - Could you see any teeth? I only saw this side of his face. She could only see this part of his face. No, it's not him. If he's able to joke like this, that means that he is in a normal state and he would call mom. That's the only logic I have. The lady approached him and asked if he was from Estonia. He laughed and said that he was a citizen of the world. He didn't want any kind of help. He just wanted to be alone and walked away. I can't imagine finding him under one of those blankets. I have no idea what to do with him. Ask him what he wants. I can send him some money to buy clothing. Mom, that's unreal! He just walked away from the person who tried to help him! If you can't catch him and he walks away... That's a different story. We can't do anything if he doesn't want any help. He doesn't want to be helped. The lady told him that his family is looking for him. There is nothing for me to suggest... Keep searching, but if you feel it's pointless, stop it. I don't know. I haven't even read a book about Colombia. I don't know what's here. Because I thought we don't need anything else, apart from Bogotá and Cali. You want to be traveling. Why did you suddenly change your mind? I haven't changed my mind. It's always been my mind. The search is a travel? It's not about that much searching. Or him, it's more like interesting. Getting you out of the home. I'm just so horribly bored. I cannot think of finding him here. It's pointless to look for him. The city is just too big, even if he is here. Maybe he went to the jungle and became a rebel. I don't think so. Could a guerrilla be an addict? I think that most of guerrilla fighters are addicts. Ah! Maybe, yeah. Then let's go with the guerrillas. Let's find the guerrillas. And the peculiar thing is that mom always says that she didn't love him enough. And that's why what happened. But I think that it was her love that made him even a little bit normal. That in the end of the day he was able to love. He was able to express it. Ten days ago I was ready to change my life. But not anymore. I don't understand why you work so much. For what? I can't imagine living like that. Working from morning to night... but still counting pennies at the grocery store. That's impossible for me. Believe me... I have understood that there is nothing to lose. We were all given our destinies at birth. If it's your destiny, then death is not scary. Believe me. You cannot turn them back for the family. And then unwrap them and say: "Mom, here there is this thirty years. I was an addict on the street. This is here for you." They're completely wasted years. And that's what it is. They can maybe not regret it because they were inside of this... whatever, madness. They don't remember the details the years blur into each other. But families remember very clearly. Every year, every - like - decade and every minute of it. I came by with a gringo. Remember, the Russian? You were going to put him in the squad car and everything? It turns out that he disappeared after that. I was inside the church when people called me and said that someone wants to get into the foundation. And it turns out, to my surprise, or by God's will, I had seen this person the same day. I'd seen him around seven o'clock that morning when I left my house and was on my way here. I saw him wandering around here. And I just entrusted him to the Lord. And I realized that the person who came asking for help, looking for the institution, to overcome a drug addiction, was the same person I'd seen hours before and entrusted to the Lord. Right! Vennaskond. Yes, sir. He has liked that band ever since he was a teenager. That day, he played them. We listened, but around here we don't really... You know, around here it's all about salsa music. The last time he was here, after I'd made an attempt to reach the family, and explain to them not to send money. I was going to give him everything that he needed. Everything he needed, I would give him, but don't send him money. I had no choice, because of what I told you. Addicts can even turn violent and aggressive, and they get angry. They get angry if you don't let them ask their family to send them money. When they sent him the wire, I said, "I'm going to go along with you, I'll let them send you money, but you're not leaving here." "No, I want to buy some clothes, I want to be well, and I want to recover, so I can go home." So I went with him. When he picked up the money, I said: "Let's go straight back to the foundation." But right away he said, "No." And he changed directions. So I tried to talk to a police officer, to get him to take him to Immigration. But he got mad at the policeman and reacted badly. The police said, "Come here!" and tried to grab him, but he got away. And I couldn't do anything. He managed to buy some socks. And he took off towards the bus station. That's as far as I went with him. I couldn't go further. I had to go back. I was left with a bitter taste in my mouth. From not having accomplished my goal at that time. I told him the money was for him to go home. For the paperwork he needed. The same thing I told him here. But when he saw the money, he changed his mind, changed his decision. Ah! This picture was here, right? Here, when he came the first time. Remember? Yes! I met him at the church. I'd already seen him around. And then again when he came back... And we became friends. He'd lost his ID. He lost everything, he had no ID. He lost them? Yes, I think so. He didn't have anything. So they sent it in my name. His mother sent me the code on my cell phone. This is when he picked up the money. In that office. He bought a cigarette. That's all I have. You know why I took his picture? Because the policeman said he would send me a squad car. The policeman said, "Send me his picture." So I sent it to him. I've got those pictures in WhatsApp. I got out and was living here, around the corner. So we'd run into each other, say hello... He was a good kid! Nice, good energy... That's the truth. We had a good time. I worked on my motorcycle. That's my bike. And when I wasn't around he'd wait for me. He'd lay down like this on the motorcycle and fall asleep. I gave him my cell phone and he played some music from his country, some band with young kids singing. I couldn't tell you what... I didn't understand. But he listened to that music on the cell phone and sang along. That's how it was. It really made us laugh and made a real impression. It transported him back home. And at that moment, through the music he remembered his childhood, his adolescence. He showed me his mother and his sister on Facebook. Later I tried to communicate with them. What did he say about his family? That he loved them very much. It was pouring rain and lightning when you were born. It was midnight on a Wednesday and grandmother took it as a bad omen. "Wednesday children have tears in their eyes," grandmother said every time we talked about you. It was the year of the horse. You were born to be gifted, yet rebellious and selfish. We have very few photos of our childhood. A handful of slides and faded pictures. In those few photos, it looks like I'm always the one hugging you. You never seem to hug me, or even notice I'm there. I don't think you ever wanted a baby sister and you never wanted to be a big brother. Grandmother said that us growing up was like witnessing a battle of the titans. You had the advantage of age and strength, but you could never break my spirit. You tried to drown me - I learnt to swim. You gave me a black eye - I hit you with a champagne bottle. I might not know you today but I was the only companion you had. When you skipped school and ran away from home, the police searched for you for weeks, but I was always the one who found you. We share the same wandering heart. In the dark, rat infested basements, nesting between the hot water pipes you had an old mattress, some blankets and candles. I was small enough to crawl into the tunnels, so the police always sent me after you. I crawled through the darkness and called your name but you never answered. It always amazes me how two people who grew up together have walked so far from one another. If you pass me on the street, would you recognise me? The last time we really looked at each other, we had a glass wall between us. It was your first time in lockup. I had just returned from America. It was the best year of my life. It was the first time I saw the ocean. It was the first time I climbed a mountain. Your head was shaved and you looked like a proper criminal, in your Adidas sweatpants and flip-flops. Nothing remained of the blond boy with slightly bucked teeth and blue eyes with a hint of naughtiness. The only background sound was our mother's voice. It got darker and darker outside. I barely saw your face but for some reason we didn't turn on the lamp. I guess we didn't want to break the moment and face each other and the harsh truth: The truth that we don't really like each other. But because of some cosmic mismatch, we are forced to share a life. I won't be there to drive you to get drugs anymore. Or stitch your face together when some crazy drunk cuts it again. I will never hide you in the basement from the police again. But I can listen... if you want to talk. They only have phone service between eight to ten in the morning. Let's call another number then. Just to the ambassador or whatever. Anybody who can... listens and speaks to us. The number you dialed is busy at the moment. Please hold. And how can we help you? Since he's an Estonian citizen, can the embassy pressure the detective working the case so he doesn't abandon it? Can the foreign ministry make an inquiry about what happened to an Estonian citizen? To speed up the procedure? Can you send us a written application regarding this case? Yes, I can send you all the documents I have from the Colombian police. We have photographic records up until protocol 1858 that day. Let's take a look at 1858 as it stands today. Some of the photographs have been identified already. Would you like to take a look at this case? It does looks familiar, Davood. Do you want to look at it? Does it look familiar? Yes. Let's see, what protocol it is... He is puffy... He does look... very familiar. When was this picture here? December 28th. The face changes when they die. Okay, but this is a person who is missing many teeth. Yes, yes. That is correct. This is a person who measures about 1.83 cm... He has several scars. Height: 1.83... Several scars. He has scars on... - on the knees. - The knees. - Knees? - Scars on the knees. Maybe... And it says that on his right leg he has a scar about 15 cm long. And there are scars on the left leg too. Did he have any surgical interventions? - Did he had any surgeries? - Yes, he did. On the legs, okay. Like appendicitis? He has a scar on part of his left iliac fossa. From appendicitis? Did he have surgery? - Appendix? - Yeah, could be. If I show you dentures, could you tell me which teeth are missing? I don't know, he just had missing teeth up and down. He had a lot of teeth missing. Did he use a prosthesis? He used to have but probably not on the street. I am quite sure it's him. Really? Yeah, I say it's 90% sure. So what we're going to do is... - I don't see the scar. - You see how puffy this face is. Look at the hair... everything. Yeah, I am sure it's him. I am pretty positive. It looks him... it's the nose... the hair... this is a white person clearly. I don't remember it being there. I think I would've recognised him. I was very nervous though, I was very upset. And some of the photos were rather, rather gory. But I don't remember the photo being there. I don't remember the photographs ending in a new page I remember it finishing... Like almost... she forgot to show the last page or something.
