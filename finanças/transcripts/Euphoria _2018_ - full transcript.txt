I'll be right back. Hang on. - Hey. - Why did you call me at this hour? - I won't come next time. - Oh, come on. - All right, all right. - Thanks. Good night. Babe! - Lola. - Yeah? - Coffee? - Coffee. Lola? Lola, look. Let me show you something. Finally! For the Immaculate Conception, Your Eminence. Yes, for the projection on 8th of December. Here's the idea. and the rays of light will emerge from their collapse, and... there will be angels flying. They will crumble? No. I meant, they will open. Like a flower. And they will reveal a flight of doves... heralding the appearance of the Virgin. - The effect would be like that of a... - What devilry! Celestial vault, on which we'll place some phrases or symbols... and they will be projected onto large screens. Lovely. Very... very evocative. Let's continue. Anything else? Well, I wanted you to reconsider our proposal for the restoration of the paintings. A Japanese multinational is willing to spend a lot of money... Yes, we spoke about that, and I'm not convinced. The restoration of the Madonna of the Harpies shouldn't be financed by a cosmetics company! - Now, if you'll excuse us-- - Please hear me out. Well, let's think about it this way. Beauty protects beauty. That painting is 500 years old. Think of all the things it has survived. Floods, earthquakes, wars... courtiers of dubious morality, thieves... Who remembers them? Nobody. I know it might seem like a risky partnership... but in another 500 years, what will be left of us or the Japanese sponsors? All that will remain, will be the beauty of the work. "Beauty protects beauty." Let me think about it, Matteo. This might be useful. I'll take it. Right... This is too big for me, you can have it. - Thank you. - It's a loan. Shirts, shirts, more shirts. You have enough. You're going only for three days. Yeah, but it's 50 degrees in Abu Dhabi. I sweat and sweat... Right, T-shirts, T-shirts! - Shall I take you to the airport? - No. I need to go to the Grand Hotel first. Arturo will take me. Are you staying at a hotel or at someone's place in Abu Dhabi? Jealous, jealous? I am staying at a hotel, a hotel! Why are you saying everything twice? Shut the suitcase, shut the suitcase. Giovanni. Yes. What? At the hospital? Yes... There are secondary lesions on the brain, but the problem is that the tumor is not visible. - What do you mean? - The ones on the brain are malignant. We'll treat them with radiotherapy, but we can't see the melanoma. But a melanoma's like a mole, right? You should be able to see it somewhere... - Perhaps on the skin. - Not always. Can you see it or... I don't understand. Some are in the mucous membranes, almost impossible to find. I'll explain it in person. But what did the neurosurgeon say? Is it operable? Matteo, try to understand. We shouldn't do something so invasive. The melanoma is very aggressive. For now, we'll do radiotherapy, try some drugs... Some experimental therapies are less toxic and they lengthen life expectancy... - All right. - ...by months. All right. I understand. - Presents! - My dear son! Stop, you're making me dizzy! My beautiful big mommy! - Ettore? - He's outside. - What did the doctor say? - Take the presents. Yes, dear, but... Bloody hell! You're so American! Plug that back in, I need to finish. Are you ready to go to Rome? I spoke to the doctor all night. It's a cyst, and its position is causing you to faint. - Piece of cake-- - Hey. Slow down. My friend, the doctor, he is a genius! He's in Boston once a month, and he's really good. And? He explained everything. Your cyst is no big deal. Well, not really, it's a pain. It's a pain because of its position. That's why you have these symptoms. - Headaches, fainting... - Hiccups. He's got hiccups as well. It's got nothing to do with it. It's been more than three days. Of course it's a symptom. - Not the shirts. - Why? I'm not applying for the military. - But you're going to stay-- - Let it be. You've been going on and on but I haven't understood anything! - Are they going to remove it? - How would I know? - I am not the doctor. - But your friend is. - Did he make a report? - Of course and he'll give it to us. We spoke over the phone. They will remove it but not right away. It's big. First, they will reduce it and then remove it. - Mum. - Yes? - Where are the presents? - I'll get them. I don't know what's for whom... This is for you, here. I've got something for you as well, but it's at home. This is for Andrea. Where is he, anyway? At home, with Michela. - I got something for Michela. - You just can't help it, can you? I had to buy something for my sister-in-law. I am talking about finishing a discussion. You brought bread, Mum? He's not camping, I have bread at home. But you're eating it already, aren't you? No, it's tonight... at 8:30. - Then let's do something nice. - All right. All right. I'll see you at 8:30. Tatiana... I told you! You, you, you... - What? - You. You faint a lot, don't you? Not really. Twice... Actually, two and a half times. - Two and a half? - Yeah, because... I'm sorry, please continue. Well, half, because when I felt I was going to faint I sat down and put my head between my knees. I was in school when it happened for the first time. I was by the board, explaining Saturn's orbit. - And boom... a black hole. - Excuse me! Excuse me, everyone. I'd like to raise a toast. To Matteo. No, it's Tatiana's birthday. She's-- - No, no! - What? I can't say it? You can say it's my birthday, but you can't say my... All right. Fine, let's make a toast to this lovely dinner! Cheers! The wine's good. Why did you ask that woman to make the cutlets? I could have done it. My son loves spending money! I faint as well. Did you get any tests done? No, I am just sad. Very sad. I recently broke up with... Well, he wasn't a good man. - I'm sorry. - Stop drinking! Luana Bosio! Do you remember her? It's been 20 years and you're still talking about her? You liked Luana Bosio, and her... Was the feeling mutual? Of course, I think he slept with her! Because he wasn't gay before. I swear, he wasn't. He always liked women! Sorry about my mother's folkloristic interlude... But then his brother came along and... stole her! Ettore wreaked havoc in Nepi. The women were crazy about him. Weren't they? - Yes, they were. - Of course! And then he married the most beautiful of them. Oh, yes! So beautiful! She had won a beauty pageant as well. - Miss... What was it? - Miss Lake Bolsena. No! What are you saying? Miss Rimini... - Miss Romagna. - Yeah, that's what I meant. Let me show you how cute they were as children. Matteo. - Matteo. - They were adorable. Look, they had dressed up for the carnival. There! Aren't they cute? - Do you like it? - That's so cute. - Isn't it? - It's beautiful. Do you remember this, Ettore? They had even learned a song. They sang and danced, and I whistled. - You whistle? - Yes, I whistle. - You should do it. - No, not now. Whistle! Whistle! All right, all right. Hang on. The ducks have fun playing In the stream... Ettore. Come on. I don't remember the song. - Well done! - Bravo! Well, a punch, for sure. You did the right thing. - But this-- - No, you have to learn to defend yourself. - You understand what he did, right? - Ettore, did you hear what happened? Speak to the headmistress... What happened? I don't believe it! Come here, look! Yeah, I know. It's like living in David Copperfield's house. - Did we wake you? - Shall I reheat the pasta? - When did you arrive? - Or do you want the roast? - Good morning. - Good morning. - You want some? - No. Don't you eat anything? You look so thin! I said we should go to a restaurant, but Rita had prepared everything. Yes, everything is ready. How about an egg with some cheese? - No. - I don't want you to fall sick as well. I love the house, it's great. Especially the terrace. Your mother had told me about it. Do you want some orange juice? - Do you want coffee? - Yes. - Coffee? - No, thank you. - Did Andrea see you? - No, but I saw him, he was playing. He loves your jigsaw puzzle. - And thanks for the perfume. - You're welcome. Well? If it was just a fling, I would've been okay with that. I wouldn't have been happy about it, but... it wouldn't have bothered me either. Now he says he needs time. What for? I don't know. I think he's not right in the head. I believe it's his sickness. He said that it's over. But he doesn't want to come back to me. He said he fell in love, you know. That's what really hurt me. And he wanted to tell Andrea everything. He's a child. What does he know about these things? And what do we tell him? That Dad's leaving Mum because he's in love with some young girl? A young girl? How old is she? Thirty, thirty-two... She's not a little girl, she's a woman. Yeah, whatever. But then, what do you know? Have you ever talked to your brother about this? No, he never told me anything. Obviously! You haven't been to Nepi in a year. - I was there the other day... - Of course. Anyway, Ettore and I... We never talk. He never discusses his affairs with me. And he never wanted to know about mine. So... Yeah, he doesn't speak to anyone. I told Andrea that he's sleeping at Gran's because of his headaches... What? Nothing. It's incredible. It's almost October and it's still so hot. Lovely. - Let me make this clear. Listen. - Light blue? - I want the brown bits. - We'll deal with the paws. - You mean light blue? - Yes, I am trying to put together the sky. - You want the brown bits? - That's enough! - Brown it is. - Will you knock it off? - I'm just trying to help. - We cannot lose a single piece. - Here, light blue. - No, it's light green. - Brown. - That's orange. - Got it? - No. No? You've never done this before? Ettore? - You've never done this? - No. Your grandfather used to do it all the time. Try. Well done! - Where is this place? - Beautiful! Where does your dealer live? Kathmandu? - That's absolutely true. - Sorry, I didn't know. Everyone's asleep! May we? Hello, everyone! Hey, beautiful! What can I get you? What do you want? A bit of Snow White? - That's not a toilet. - Idiot! - Hi. - Hi. - Hi. What are you up to? - Just cruising. Nice music. Old, but good. Look at them. Look. Come here. - No, I'm scared. - Of what? - They are bad. - No, they are not! Look at this one. I hate seagulls! Mum, see you there at 12. Yes, we'll leave as soon as Michela's ready. Andrea, do you want to see your uncle's office? - May I? - Go on. Sara said you approved them the other day. All that's missing is "La dispersion Du fils," which is beautiful. Okay, but let's do it quickly. I don't have a lot of time. Of course, you don't. Will it swallow us? Don't worry, it's all make-believe! It's so cool! Do you like it, Andrea? Are you sure, dear? I'll drive from Nepi and pick him up. You'll have to wake up really early and you don't know the city... What do you think, Ettore? Here, hold this. Give me that. Look. Liar! - Is the lady make-believe? - No, she's real. Watch out, or else we'll fall. There they are. What's wrong? Are we late? - No... - Everything's all right. We just got the scans done. We need to come back the day after tomorrow. We went into this... - technological tunnel... - Matteo. - Why does it say "oncology"? - What? Look at the report. It says, "Reduction of tumor mass: Oncology." Of course it's Oncology, Mum. I wouldn't send you to Maternity for radiotherapy, right? All right, but read what it says here. Look. "Tumor," "Oncology." Because "Tumor" comes from Latin. - Yes, I know. - It means "swelling." It can be inflammation, a cyst, or this thing here... It's all the same. Yes, but it's written in the report that... Stop it already! Did you talk to the doctor? Was Bartoletti there? I'll call him so he can explain everything to you. In fact, we'll go see him. - Michela, we'll go back-- - Everything's okay. Where's the car? - Where's the car? - In the parking lot. Let's go. Tell them to get lost. Get rid of them. - What do I tell them? - I don't know. You have guests coming over, right? - But they are not staying... - Get rid of them! The boy as well, he's getting on my nerves. Bye, Dad! - Did I wake you? Is it too loud? - No. I was dreaming... It was a weird dream. We were here. So were you. I don't know. May I? I don't know if you should be doing that with the therapy... - Just this once. - Okay. Take the short one. I said the short one! Is he your... Your... boyfriend? No. No, he's a friend. I care about him. I mean... Do we have sex? No. Why not? We're too close. He's family. He's my lady-in-waiting. - What? - Nothing... I was just curious. About what? When you do... your thing... I mean, not with him. Do you give or do you take? What would you prefer? Considering you're my little brother, I'd prefer that you're not the one taking it. No, I mean, you. What would you prefer? You're a moron. Apart from the fact that taking it might be... very instructive. But... it doesn't work that way. It doesn't? Then how does it work? You give or take depending on... the circumstances and the interlocutor. Oh. Yeah. The interlocutor? - The interlocutor is very important. - What's your interlocutor type? Well... for the sake of argument... Yeah, yeah... - I'm just curious. - For example... You'd be my interlocutor type. Do you know why? Because of your beard. This little beard right here... And the way your hair sticks out of your shirt. - Don't touch me. - Why not? - Speak, but don't touch me. - Okay. - And these thighs... - Don't touch me. You have beautiful thighs! Don't touch me or else I'll kill you. Oh, yes! Harder! What would you like to have? A pomegranate juice. And they know nobody's watching them. They say it should be inflated only after leaving the plane. - But what if I drown inside it? - You'd be dead! Matteo. - Hi, Ettore. - This is my brother Ettore. - Hi. - Hi. - How did it go? - Fine. I'm a little tired. The train took ages to get here. You took the train? - Why didn't you take a taxi? - Yeah, right. - Henceforth Arturo will take you. - Sure. Bye, have a good time. - Thank you! - Bye! A chauffeur's all I need. I'll be right back. Ettore. Wait a minute. What's the problem? I'll have Arturo take you. He's very punctual. I'm not going to go around with a driver, all right? - Will that be embarrassing? - Nah. What's this? It's a mood stabilizer. - Did Bartoletti give it to you? - Yes. Is it benzodiazepine? - Who knows? Who's ever taken it? - Me. No, this is great. It's mild. Get ready. We're going out for dinner. And tomorrow I'll send Arturo with you. - Again? - What's the problem, Ettore? I earn a hundred times more than you. That's the least I can do for you. Don't you worry about me. You're putting me up, that's enough. If you need anything, use this. - Bye, Matteo. - You're leaving already? - Talk to you later? - Okay. - Bye. - Bye. - See you tomorrow! - Yes. Bye. Let's go! One of my clients in Abu Dhabi... has closed a big contract in Kenya. You know Kenya, right? It's arid... Deserts... So what do the Arabs do? - They bring water. - Meaning? Nanotechnological sand that retains moisture, stuff like that. And with the water there will be trees, crops, and most importantly, shade. Of course. Continue. My idea is to propose to them to build refugee camps, in the reclaimed areas. Something like this has never been done before. And when I was making a list of sponsors, I thought of you. Why me? What's in it for my image? What are the benefits? The world is changing. We're moving from the era of desire to that of need. Old-school charity isn't enough. They need food, toilet paper, and above all, tents! And who'll give them the tents? - Us? - Yes! We'll make them using your fabric. Sandro, the business of the future is M-E-R-C-Y. Great. It's a brilliant project. Well done. What is it that doesn't add up for you? I want to build new refugee camps, with water, trees, plumbing everything... And you don't like it because I'll make money out of it? - It's not that. - It isn't? - I really like it. - Fine. I like how you're getting to the root of the problem. Don't solve the refugee crisis but give them parquet. - A nice refugee camp with parquet. - You're mistaken. At least I'm doing something. All you do is criticize. I'm not criticizing you. - Good morning. - Good morning. I'm Arturo. - Nice to meet you. - Same here. Thank you. I can't tell you, it's a surprise. Where are you? Can you ask Lola to make me some white rice, and boiled potatoes? I need to eat light. All right, bye. - You can't take this inside. - No? I'll keep it in your room, don't worry. I wanted to tell my family. Can you tell the anesthesiologist to give me a heavier dose? I know it's not necessary but I really like the feeling. - There he is! - There he is! Oh, that's scary. Can you tell me what was wrong with your calves? What do you mean? They were like toothpicks. - I've got big thighs. - Yes. - Hold still. - The prostheses they had... were too small. I chose the bigger ones. - There are sizes? - Of course. Like there are for breasts. Two, three, four-- Breasts serve a purpose. What's this for? They serve a purpose too. Don't worry. But I made a mistake. They're too small. I'm always afraid of exaggerating. I want to click a picture but they look so stiff. That's normal. They said I'll have to walk, walk... - And then they will-- - Deflate them? No! What would be the point then? Morning. Good morning. What time is it? I don't know, it's early. You were dreaming, talking in your sleep. Really? What did I say? You said... "I don't want to die. I don't want to die." Really? I haven't been in a hospital since... Michela gave birth. There are some really sick people in there. Tell me something I don't know. I've already divided your doses by the day. You can't get it wrong. But don't take the yellow ones in the evening. Yes, you told me. If you do, you'll be up all night. I'll leave everything here so that I can find it tomorrow. Remember, to fall sleep, you've got the... - Here's the water. - Thank you. - Thank you. - You're welcome. - ...the drops and the blue ones. - Okay, put it there. - Good morning. - Good morning. Excuse me, we're almost done here. No, excuse me. I slept in Matteo's room. I didn't want to be alone. - Lift it up, take it out, that's it. - Okay, thank you. When do you start the new therapy? I don't know, Matteo talked to the doctors. Say hi to Matteo. - See you, Ettore. - Bye. Say hi to everyone. Bye, Luca! Goodbye, ma'am. Ma'am? Is there anyone else in the house or just us? - Just us. - Good. Look at him. Walk, walk, walk... Whom did you talk to? We'll send an e-mail and explain everything. Stop. Pull over, I'll be right back. Right. This will work. But that's a hair mask. Come with me. Let me see your face. Well, I would suggest a moisturizer. - What's your name? - Viola. And how does this one work? You apply it at night, around the waist. Perfect. I want to get rid of these love handles. Does it really work? It gives exceptional results, but you'll have to use it regularly. Matteo, it was so expensive. "It was so expensive!" So what? Hi! Hi. - You okay? - I am fine. What did you do today? I went out with Tatiana. We went to a bookshop. I'm trying to make a new program for the kids when I get back home. All this time to myself, I might as well use it. How's Tatiana? Is she sad? Very sad. Oh, I went to see Bartoletti. The tablets have arrived. You have to start the treatment tomorrow. - Hi, Ettore. - Hey, Luca. He texted me the doses. I'll forward it to you. Am I supposed to shampoo after I take the pills? I know, he gave me the tablets loose. He must have had a big box. - But it doesn't matter, does it? - No, it doesn't. - Want some? It's cold. - No, thank you. - Thanks again. - No problem. What are you up to, Matteo? Nothing, I'm taking a shower. But let's not eat late or else we'll miss the film. My cream? - Here. What's with the pantomime? - The perfume-shop bag? What's with those pills? Why did you throw away the packaging? I didn't want him to read the description. What description? What kind of a question is that? He's got nothing to do all day. He finds some blog with the comments of the fucking terminally ill. And what does he see there? "Brain tumor. Life expectancy: six to eight months." What are you talking about, Matteo? What do you think? - What does Ettore know? - Nothing. - And Michela? Your mother? - Nothing. They know nothing. - You don't have the right-- - Listen to me very carefully. Ettore doesn't need to know a fucking thing! The doctors agree. It's important... that he believes he's getting better. Okay. Good. I was telling him that the Madonna of the Harpies is one of the ten paintings we'll work on. - Mr. Barbieri. - Yes? Do you wish to receive a favor? - We're leaving. Are you coming? - Of course. You're out of shape. Swimming against the current makes no difference. You should practice more. Hey, we have to go that way. What's that? - I'll take you to Lourdes. - Me? What? Am I an invalid? No, I have to go for work. I have a client who owes me money, and he wants to pay in cash. I don't need the cash but I get to use his private jet. We'll leave in the morning and be back in the evening. You're crazy. I mean it. I need to go. I have to do some research for this Virgin Mary event... that we're working on. - We'll ask for a favor. - Are you a believer now? - Well, it depends. - On what? The circumstances, the interlocutor... I'll be waiting outside. Come with me. Let's go seek some blessings. In a private jet? Who's going to know? Our Lady. She knows and sees everything. There you go, you're a believer. I'm not going to Lourdes. They're good, right? Where are you going? Medjugorje. - And you? - Same here. The Papa Boys are good, right? What are you thinking about? Sometimes I feel like... I have a giant squid inside my head, and it's squirting ink. It pisses me off but I can't talk about it. It's like a rebellion. A muti... A mutiny? Nah. I think it's seasickness. Offer your life Like Mary at the foot of the cross And you will be the servant of all men Servant of love Priest of humanity You went forward in silence... "Dear Aries, at the moment, you are among the most bitter people of the zodiac..." Hell, yeah! "You had a lot of problems, because Jupiter wasn't aligned. But I have to tell you... take a deep breath and learn to be patient--" Forget it. Read yours. "Dear Scorpio... the stars are in your favor." I've got five stars for everything. - Health, work, love... - Weird, right? "Venus is aligned with Jupiter and--" What does it say about love for Aries? "Love, Aries..." - Okay, I'll read it, but... - Go ahead. "You should look after your four-legged friends." That's what it says. I'm not making it up. Okay, forget about it. What's her name? Elena. And? - What? - I mean... What do you want to know? Are you in love with her? Yes, I am. - What about her? - Yes, she loves me too. - Open. - Lucky you. Open your mouth. Open. Open! When Michela found out she went crazy! She was so furious, I can't even describe it. She might've ended up in a hospital. Andrea's too young. I don't want him to suffer. But I'm not going back to Michela. She's vacuous, shallow. And unfortunately, I've always known that. At least she was beautiful before. She still is. You're so nasty. You're right, I'm a shitty person. Little Bosnian river. Bullet-riddled Bosnian house, and children with Bosnian umbrellas. Bosnian geese. Bosnian salon. That was a junction. - Bosnian police. - Exactly. Big handsome Bosnian at 12 o'clock. Old Bosnian man! Eyes on the road, please. Got rid of your hiccups, though. Hail Mary, full of grace, the Lord is with thee. Blessed art thou among women and blessed is the fruit of thy womb, Jesus. Holy Mary, Mother of God, pray for us sinners, now and at the hour of our death. Amen. In the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit. Amen. - Wait, hold on. - She said amen. Bon appétit. Buon appetito. Guten appetit. Guten appetit. - Tomorrow we'll meet Anne. - Who is she? She's some kind of a publicist, I think. She'll get us closer to the apparition so that we don't have to stand in the crowd. When is the apparition? I don't know what time... What... As if She was going to appear before you! - Did you understand that? - Yes, she said twice a month. - No. - Every two months? No, the second of every month. Today's the ninth. There are a lot of other things we can do tomorrow. We can ask the guide later. How many stations are there? Fourteen. We're already halfway. Come on. We don't go up the mountain to free ourselves of our crosses, but to learn how to bear them. My brother's tired. - I'm fine, come on. - My calves are sore! You should have kept your own! Hang on a second. A lot of people who are suffering, come here to be liberated with the help of prayer. Let's pray for her. - Ettore. - What? Do me a favor. Can you go out for a moment? - Where? - To the balcony. - Are you crazy? - Come on! Only for 15 minutes. Half an hour, tops. - I'll go down to the hall instead. - No way! If she sees us, she'll kick us out. - Who's that? - Nobody. Don't worry about him. Put your coat on, it's cold. - Give me a hand. - Here. It's so cold, you're insane! Take the pillow. I'm sorry as well. - Make it quick! - Yes, give me 20 minutes. Doctor. Hello. Hi, Ettore. You're looking good. Yes, I am feeling very energetic. I felt like taking the stairs, don't know why. The cortisone is giving you a rush. But it's good. Movement is good. Listen, I'll need another sick note for school. I'll need to speak to the substitute about my program. When can we do the surgery? One thing at a time. We first need to finish this cycle of radiotherapy. Then we'll think about it. Okay? All right. I'll be in my office in half an hour. Do you remember where it is? Yes. We can talk about it over there. Come and see me. Actually, I've got the car waiting for me. I'll see you in ten days for the checkup. - All right. - Thank you. Move away from the fireplace. - Do you like it? - It's great. Is it an original? Of course. I am going to ask your uncle about the tickets for the game. - For Sunday? - No, for Inter. - Right, Arturo? - Yes. Look at Arturo, son. Have you ever met a Roman who supports Inter Milan, Andrea? - Hi. - Hi. Look at him. He's driving me around. When you come here, I'll impr... I'll impr... Introdu... What did you say, Dad? Nothing. Let me speak to Mum. I mean, my mother. Put Gran on. Gran! I think she's upstairs. I can hear her whistling, follow the whistle. Grandma! She's deaf. Grandma. It's Dad. What are you doing on the ladder? Get down, Mum! - Then who will change the bulb? - Gran, get down. What were you thinking, climbing up that ladder? - What is it? - I just wanted to say hello. Okay, you said hello. Bye. What is it? What's wrong? I've been trying to call you for the past ten days but you and your shit of a brother don't even answer the phone. I get it, I shouldn't have called. Just because you're sick doesn't mean you can get away with everything. That's not how it works. I'm your mother, show some respect. You're right. I'll call you tonight. Okay? Okay. - Don't forget to call me. - I won't. - Don't climb that ladder again. - Bye, Dad! Andrea, take the ladder away from her. - Okay, don't worry. - Bye. Bye. - Matteo, shall we go? - Yes. - Good morning. - Good morning. - Did you eat breakfast? - No. - I'll have a mandarin juice. - Mandarin? - No, pomegranate. - Pomegranate? Pomegranates, pomegranates... So many pomegranates! Don't worry, the legal department is already working on it. - I understand-- - I'm sure by this afternoon-- I don't want to deal with these things! I don't want to know! I don't want to end up in the papers again. - Don't worry. - Call Prestieri and he will resolve this. - I'll take care of it. - No. Please calm down. We called Prestieri and Bellucci. We did warn you, but you didn't listen. Sorry to bother you, but the bank called. There was a suspicious transaction on your credit card. The gold one, that you never use. Turn off the vacuum cleaner, Lola! Yes! - Where's Ettore? - I don't know. Ettore. Ettore. Ettore. I'm going out. What do you want for dinner? I don't know. Whatever you want. I told you I'm going out. You're eating at home. What's up? Nothing. Well? Ham and cheese? I told you, whatever you want. What's pissing you off? You made such a fuss about not wanting a driver, or the credit card... And then you spent 9,000 euros? There it is. I knew something was bothering you. What did you spend 9,000 euros on? I bought a watch. Okay? What watch? A Cartier, the cheapest one. How typical for a teacher! - And where is this watch? - In my room. Why aren't you wearing it? Because you're ashamed, aren't you? If you'd asked me, I'd have got you one. That would've been better, right? So that I'm indebted to you for life? I didn't want that. You don't owe me anything! Remember what you had said? "I earn a hundred times more than you." So why is it bothering you? How much did you pay for the one you're wearing? Twenty thousand? You boast about your wealth in front of your friends, and then complain about paying for me? What are you saying? It's not about the money. - So what is it about? - Forget it. - I don't want to talk about it. - What is it? Tell me. What is it about? You just want to prove to the world that you're a good man, but you're not. Why are you keeping me here? Whom are you doing this for? For Mum? Really? Do you still have to make up for the fact that you're a fag? You're an asshole. What's that? Shit! That's disgusting! It's a fish! - It fell from its beak. - What have I got on my face? Don't touch it! Get rid of it! You think it's disgusting? You love eating it, don't you? - Get me a bucket. - Seriously? Throw it away! No, we need to put it back in the river. In the Vetere. - What did you say? - We need to put it back in the... Ettore! What's wrong? Ettore! What happened? Look at me. Lola! Don't shout... July, don't come to an end just yet I want to see her It would be a big mistake Not to see her again - You're not at the seashore - You're not at the seashore - Anymore... - Anymore, my love It's July Why aren't you here? I love you so much I want to see you... You should go home. What are you doing here? I'm not leaving you with these two corpses. Go home. Ettore? Matteo! I'm giving him a tour of the house. Okay, I'll take you. No, I don't take pills. Maybe an herbal tea? Yeah, an herbal tea. What do you think? Where's Matteo? In the guest room, I guess. Ettore's room? Guido, forget it. I'll get a taxi and go home. I'll get a taxi. I'll go home. Hey, go away. Tatiana, let's go home. No, I don't snort. - Come on. - I won't be able to get it up. I'll get it up for you, don't worry. - You have beautiful muscles. - They took some work. - Hello, beautiful! - Let's see a little of you. - What's her name? - Mia. Mia. She's cute. Well, she's yours and this is mine! She's jealous. Come here! Fuck off! - Are you crazy? - It was the dog. - Leave her alone. - No, I'm sorry... - No, no. - Wait. No, don't touch me. Who do you think you are? - Marcello, I didn't mean to... - No, forget it. I made a mistake. - She was trying to bite me. - Forget it. - Come on, Marcello, please-- - No, no. I said no. Leave me alone. Mia, let's go. - I'm sorry, Marcello... - No! - Marcello... - Who the fuck do you think you are? Being rich doesn't give you the right to behave this way! - Wait... - Go to bed, you madman. - Marcello. - Stop it. Come on, Mia. - I am sorry. - Go to bed. - Come on, Mia. - Marcello... Marcello... Marcello... For how long has he been unconscious? I don't know. I found him like that. Thank you. No problem. - No, I just lit it. - No more smoking. There's only half of it left. In half an hour, Lola will come and remove it. I'm sorry. I'm sorry, I fucked up. I just wanted to get rid of the emptiness in here. - I'm worried about Ettore. - Don't drag your brother into this. - You're the problem. - Yes... You're a junkie. You need treatment. Yes... - I need treatment. - Stop agreeing with me. - Just stop it! - Wait. I don't want you to go away. Don't you care about me anymore? It's something else, Matteo. I love you. I do. Don't pretend you don't know that. "I love you, Matteo." I got some fruit juices. Do you want one? No, thanks. Drink some. It's good for you. You need to gain some weight. - Not with fruit juice... - There's sugar in it. - Shall I open the window? - No. Will you please calm down? You just got here. The food's not bad here. I finished that meat you didn't want yesterday, it was good. They're taking good care of your brother. - Do you like this place? - It seems nice. Shall we book a room for Mum as well? I'd be more than happy to stay with you. But you don't want me here. You'll be home in two days. The doctor said he needs to run a few more tests, then you can go. Let's go to the bar. To the bar? - Yes. - Why? - You should go. - Let's go drink something. It's a beautiful day, go see a few people. It'll be crowded. "You okay, Virus?" "Yes, Prostate. Trachea!" I guess it will be fun. He said they do not provide treatment for such patients. That the same can be provided at home. I asked him... "What do we do if this happens again?" He told me that sooner or later he'll have to go to a hospice. What kind of a doctor talks like that? He yelled at me in the middle of the corridor. He's demented, an imbecile. Did you say anything to Mum? Come on. You can't let Ettore see you crying. After this course, I'll take him to Milan, New York... - These centers where-- - Why did you not tell him? Do you want to tell him? I can't believe this is happening! We were together for 20 years and look what happened. He wouldn't even look at me! Come on! Don't let him see you crying! Hey! What are you up to? And it's not true. Ettore's always happy to see you. In fact, he told me... that he still loves you. He just needs a little time. He said that? Yes. Ettore, we're going back to the room. I shouldn't have called him. At one point, I was literally screaming. - Anyway, can you come see me tonight? - No, not tonight. - Why not? - I'm staying here. - With Ettore? - Yeah. - Is he coming back to your place? - Obviously. Please come to mine. - What is it? - Hold on a second. In fact, I've brought us a little present. Wait. Come on. That's it! Left... One, two, three... Right. So, you do remember. Let me keep it in your room. Look what we did while you were away. - What? - We finished the jigsaw. It's not finished, there's a piece missing. We couldn't find it. But, come on, it's finished. No. It's not finished. - Oh! - Excuse me. - Sorry, I was looking for you. - You gave me a fright. The yellow stripes are horrible. The dragon's good, let's keep that. Did you play here as children? No, I didn't. Matteo, maybe... - Is the house far away? - No, just around the corner. There you go! - You broke it all up, Dad? - Yeah, so we can work on it together. You want a coffee? No, maybe some tea. Can we have some tea? Thank you. Thanks for coming. Did you take the train? - You're really beautiful. - Thank you. Does Ettore know that you called me? No, Ettore doesn't know anything. It was my idea. - You haven't seen him in a while, right? - Why didn't he call me? Is something wrong? Yeah, he was in the hospital for a few days. But now they've sent him home. To my place, here in Rome. Unfortunately... Physically, he's fine. But I think that he'll start to deteriorate soon. They can't operate. He knows nothing. He thinks it's benign. He doesn't know? What is it, a tumor? Basically, his health will start declining very soon. How soon? I don't know. Not too long. I never spoke to him again. And he wanted it that way. He said that it was because... of his son, that it was better not to hear from each other again. I understood what he meant, though... Yes, he told me. He never went back home. He still talks about you. He says that he was wrong, and that he still loves you. I don't know... It's a difficult situation. Are you seeing someone else? Are you asking me to see him again? Are you seeing someone else? What kind of a question is that? What do you mean? Tell me. Lola! - Ettore? - On the terrace. This fish landed on his head. I picked it up. It was huge. Madam. Sir. What is it? A gin and tonic. Oh, God! - I'm sorry! - No, I'm sorry! I am so sorry. - Did I hurt you? - In the eye. I'm sorry, I won't smash it again. I love you. I'm going out. Have a good evening. Bye. - What are you doing? - Having an apple. Is that okay? Can you see me? No. It's cool, right? What are you doing? Let me see. What? Matteo. Elena? She's asleep. Wake her up. I'll take you to the beach. No, not the beach. I think she needs to get home. Wake her up, I know she'll come. Hurry up. Go. The bathypelagic zone. Do you teach the same subject? I teach Math, but he has mentioned this a thousand times. Beyond 4,000 meters, we have the abyssalpelagic zone, a perpetually dark place, home to some quite disturbing characters, like the black swallower, the giant squid... - The giant squid! - And this one... The tripod fish. It has this... sort of a trestle, it rests on the seabed, opens its mouth and eats. There's more... 7,000 meters below the sea level... is the hadopelagic zone. It's derived from the Latin word "Hades." - Meaning? - It's fucked-up! No light, no colors... Everything's black and white! Blind organisms that can't even see where they are, it's so ugly. Basically, it's the afterlife. You have to be very careful about the people you go with. Yeah, some "good" ones might leave you down there. Well, you can't do anything about it. You just have to stay calm and rise slowly. Will you come with me? As soon as I feel better I'm going to go again. Okay. Dessert? - No, thanks. - I'm going for a swim. - Ettore, don't be an idiot. - Are you crazy? - It's too cold. - It's such a wonderful day! - It's December! - I'm going. - Come on, Ettore... - It's cold! Bloody hell! I'm sorry, I have a train at 4:00. I can't miss it. Don't worry. We'll go in a while. Hang on! Hermès. She shouldn't have come here. What do you mean? We had a good time. She was happy. Yeah, right! She felt sorry for me. - She shouldn't have seen me this way. - What way? You're just a little thinner, that's it. She wouldn't even look at me. All she saw was a dying man. Did you go on the internet? Did you read stuff? That's all bullshit. Don't let it put you off. Everything is under control. Just finish the cycle and-- Stop, Matteo. Stop. Stop saying that everything's under control. Don't you get tired? You talk to the doctors, you call Elena... You decide everything. And I can't even say that I'm afraid. I can't say it because you've decided so. Why did you call her? Why? I thought you might like it. How fucking dare you? Tell me, did you script a "goodbye scene"? At the beach, all romantic... So that you could narrate it to your friends and they would pretend to be sad while holding a glass of champagne? Is that what you wanted? "You should have seen them kissing!" Is that what you wanted? Is that what you wanted? - What the fuck are you saying? - Your friends disgust me! They make me sick! I despise them! Wait... My friends disgust you? Well then, I must disgust you as well, right? - You think I'm ridiculous, don't you? - Yes, you disgust me. - You feel sorry for me, right? - Yes. And what about you? You think you're perfect? Because I believe you're a fucking coward who has never risked anything in his life. You've always thought you're better because you're a fag, - because you're different! - What? But being normal is way more difficult. - You should try it. - Being you? You don't even love your son. Keep your fucking hands to yourself! Don't you ever say that again! Have you lost your mind? Stop it, will you? You're hurting me! When are you going to die? What happened to you? Yes, Arturo. What is it? No change in the schedule. Why? Call Ettore. Calling Ettore. The number you're trying to reach is unavailable. Call home. Call Arturo. - Hello. - Arturo! - Yes, I am here. - And? I got here at 8:30, and he usually waits at the door. I've been calling him for an hour, but his phone's off. No one answered the intercom as well. Has Lola not arrived yet? I don't think so, she's not answering the intercom. - That's why I called you. - Don't go upstairs, okay? Wait for me, I'll be right there. Don't go upstairs. - Hello? - What the fuck happened to you? - I've been calling you for an hour! - Why are you screaming? Don't scream. Am I not allowed to go for a walk? A walk? You need to be at the hospital for your therapy! I'm not going to the hospital again. It's all right. No, it's not all right. Please forgive me, I didn't mean it. I said some terrible things and I'm sorry. Tell me where you are and we can go to the hospital together. Matteo... I'm exhausted. I'm sorry about what happened. It's not your fault. I know I'm dying. I won't go back to the hospital. That's not true... You're not dying. Well, I am not dying right now. Ettore... Please go home. Let me be by myself today. I'm so sorry... Stop crying, will you? I'm sorry. Come on, stop it. Ettore? You won't believe what's happening right now. It's beautiful. What is it? A huge flock of birds. And they're flying in this magnificent pattern... Here, listen to the sound they're making. Can you hear it? They're flying towards the river. - The river... - Bloody hell, Matteo! I've never seen something like this. The birds are black and silver... Making these beautiful shapes! It's like a party. Yeah, it's a party, indeed! It's marvelous! FOR EMILIO FOR MARIO
