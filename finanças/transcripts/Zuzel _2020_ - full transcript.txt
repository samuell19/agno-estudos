Stupid! Can't you swim? No. Come on! It was a joke! Some joke. Wow... It's you. Well, yeah I guess it's me. Why? Because I have a crush on you. Hey! It was a joke! Hey! What's up? I have nothing to change into. I'm borrowing your shirt. Hey, I don't even know you. Girl. But I know you. Don't worry, you'll get it back. When is your mother coming back to work? She'll be back sometime. My rubber just burst. Your rubber fucking blew up. Rubber exploded. Go on! Fill it up. I still have to swap the wheel. Just a moment. Fuck me! What an amateur. Come on! Let's go! Chop-chop! Fuckin'hell. Got it! Hi Andrew... Hiya. Yova!!! Lova rides with Everest, Sorry, I mean he'll ride with you Sugar. They didn't take Dudek for the World Cup, so damn it, he's not going. And also, fucking hell, Everest will go too. So boys. Do you have any questions for me? No, boss. For sure? Guys, let's go like a shit off a shovel, the rest is up to God. All right! Get a move on and see you later. Look at that! Come on! What do you have there? Aaa, it's Richi, this moron... Give me a break kid. He's got more equipment than talent. Don't even look at that. He can't even make a girl come. They all complain. Come on. Leave it. You gotta tighten up the chain. Hold the clutch. Calm down Lova. You'll lose with my brother anyway. How about you? You little clown. Especially with him as a mechanic! Get out of here now! See ya later! Get out of here kid! I don't wanna see you anymore! Outta here! How's your old lady? Could be worse. I'll kick your ass tomorrow. Yeah right! I'd like to fucking see you try. Don't worry. I've already booked a VIP ambulance for you, for tomorrow. And I had a dream with you wearing white sheets. How are you doing? How am I supposed to be doing? I am still alive... Thanks. Don't "thanks, Mum" me! You need to eat! Thank you. I'm full. You need to eat! There you go. Baby is crying. Why is that? Because she has nothing to wear. Her girlfriends make fun of her. See? And yet you ate a little bit more. Thank you. Stop smoking! Ouch! Mum! So, you've got nothing to wear? Is that right? No, I don't. I've already worn all that stuff! How am I supposed to wear it again? You don't get it. No, I don't get it. Everyone is going to make fun of me. They're making fun of her already, for wearing knock-offs. You have nothing to wear, right? Scrooge. Scrooge! I'm returning this. How did you know where do I live? Everyone know. I don't like them ironed. No? No. Is that better? Now it's not ironed. I guess. Roma. Lova. I know. So do you love me or are you just fooling around? Hey kiddo. Who won the race!? Dark Racks! Who? Dark Racks, Dark Racks!!! Let's go, let's go! Let's go, let's go... My dearest Father! You must have been praying for us. Dark Racks!!! Dark Racks!!! Dark Racks!!! How did he get in here, huh? How did he get in here... You promised. What did I promise? And you promised you'd stop drinking. You're too wasted... Go home! Lova! Lova! Fuck! Lova! You promised! Yova, Wakey-wakey! It's moyning alyeady! Yova! Hi Yuyo! Hi! Hi Yova! What are you doing here? Nothing... My mum told me not to chase after boys. That they should chase after me. And? And... I don't listen to her. I like the chase. You should listen to your mother. Is it new? New, new!!! Hey, what the fuck?! Guys! Roll it over! Now it's been baptized! For fuck sake! I've been saving for a month for this. Whole month? Come on, now you can actually ride in it! Lova hasn't paying me for three months already. Just one month? This is worth one month? Fuck off! Not everyone has a well-off family. Sorry man. Oooo! Is Everest feeling low? Get lost. Look. He's devastated. Hey junior... Come on, don't give up. Hey you, you look like you've given up on life. Do you have a crush on him, too? No, it's just you. What if I already have plans in the love department? Then we can be friends. Benek, would you mind moving a finger? Do something. Are you going to the beach or what? Do you need a sunbed? - All right, all right... - Back to work! Everything's under control. We've got this. - We'll make it in time. - Don't make me show you how. What a race man! Yo dude! Get lost from here. It's a work zone. Last preparations. Lova is in a yellow helmet. Everyone knows our favorite is in great shape. It was a great start for Lova. How brilliantly he escaped his rivals! But they don't give up. They are very very close. Last lap... Lova is in the steady lead... And what a tragic story! What a bad luck! The malfunction happens to him at worst possible moment. A few meters before the finish line. He was so close! Why so glad? You lost, didn't you? Well, I lost but I was driving well. I wasn't the fastest, but... I can race. That's how it is in sports. You win some and you lose some. Today it was my turn to lose. Did you skimp on the chain, and that's why it snapped? He's known for being skimpy. Do you have any more questions? Perhaps something less witty? Welcome and congratulate. Tell us what are your first impressions? It was a difficult race, but we've got good points for our team. We were hoping for a full score in this race, but sadly it didn't work out. You're not even gonna say goodbye? Come on. We're getting the fuck out of here! Come on Lova. Let's go. Come on, it's your turn! Riczi! Thank you! Thank you! Lova! Lova! Lova!!! For fuck sake! Lova! Lova! Lova!!! What did I tell you? Fucking hell! Lova and Sugar will take the podium in individual competitions for the City Mayor's Cup. Are you mad at me? What are you doing here? Swimming. Can't I? Sure you can, I simply want to know. Next time, come and ask me. And what kind of an outfit is that? I forgot my swimsuit. When is your mother coming back? She barely started, and she's already gone. Why do you miss her so much? - Good Afternoon! - Oh, Lova... Today I brought my own cup... Congratulations. Look at that, let's make a use of it... No, thank you. Cheers. For a full score. That's great! So cool, cool... See you around. - Take care. - Good luck. Now we have a champion. Mum... I already told her. You'll slip me a little cash, right? Sit down! Sit down! I'm not eating today. It's too greasy. Come on. At least sit down for a moment. Let her go. She'll come when she's hungry. I'm not gonna beg her. Aren't you happy? Why should I be happy? You can't cook that... No, I guess you can't. We need to eat. Mum, eating isn't what we live for. Interesting. You don't eat, you die. You don't drink, you die as well. You know what... Get the fuck out of here. Right away. Get the fuck out of here! Really mummy? Well yeah. Ok. Ok. That's enough. That's good. Ok. Let's put your hand over here. That rope... Wait. Let's put your helmet on first. That's fine. Hop. Finally! Okay Adaś, let's go. Ok. I've got him. There he is - what a king. Speed up, but fucking slowly all right? Give it full power and nothing less! Come on! Hit it! Right now! Go on Adaś! He's doing good. Come on. Let's catch him. There he is, Adaś! All right... slow down... Slow down. Come over here, to the side. That's gonna be easier. Good. - Hold on. - Get back a little bit. Hold on... Hi five Adaś! We got it! - All right. - Champ! Champ! Damn it. I think I'd rather die. Duduś, what are you talking about? Lova! I could lend you some money for a decent ride. This here is embarrassing! You could lend me some for an engine. I'll pay you back. See ya. Eeeee!!! Say cheese! Loony! Duduś! Roma? Who let you in here? I know people. Nice gap. I'd bang it if you like. You can bang yourself! Crazy chick! What, are you gonna follow me like that all the time? You're the one who's following me now. Maybe we can make it work? Hands up. Tell me. Were you there or not? Tell me. Were you there or not? - Stop it. - Stop it. Lova! That's for you! Come on! Just see the difference between here and over there. I saw that. It's fucking hard. Over there, closer to the line guys! Look at that man. It's fucking hard as a dick. It's fucking not even crumbling. Fuck this. We'll put a five on it and a small nozzle... Ignition 25, short motor and it will be fine. All right guys, so... Wheel up front and let's go! - Five on the wheel? - Exactly. - All right. "Speedway dismissed again because of the weather" "Ladies and gents, today there will be no racing." Kid, don't ever leave your leg behind, cos it's gonna spin you around. Just like that? Never take the leg off the hook! Don't fool around with the handle. Jesus, stop picking on everything! Just don't fool around with the accelerator. And...? Not gonna happen. We shouldn't have trained that much. What?! Are you made out of sugar? Damn you... "made from sugar"... Eeee, Lova! Lova, are you coming? Are you coming with us? Get in! No... Go ahead... Lova! Lova! I love you!!! Lovaaa!!! Hey! - Hop on. - I didn't order a taxi. Come on. Don't be silly. Come in, I have some dry shirts. Then maybe you'd like some tea? Don't worry, my mum is home, I won't hurt you! Come on. Hello. Whoever heard of riding around on a bicycle in such a downpour! All your friends have nice shiny cars! So let them have them. And what? Why can't you have one? Dry yourself off! Lovka. Lovka. Stop smoking! Lovka? Would you borrow me some money? For what? It doesn't matter. Don't you wanna help out your sister? What do you say? How much? Jesus, what do you need so much for? I cross my heart I need it. There you go... Just don't tell mum. Ok? All right. If you need money, go to work. Go to work... And if you're pregnant, stop smoking! Get lost! You could buy one for yourself. Red one would be the best. Buy what? A car! A red one. Red is clearly visible. Seriously. Leave me alone today. You're exactly like him. Exactly. Just like your father. Motherfucker! Copy. Paste. Just like daddy. Identical. Copy. Paste. Fuck that. The same. Are you done? Copy. Paste. Fucking daddy. That's it. I've heard enough. Yeah, that's great. And who was whoring around with this scumbag? Was it me? Damn! You didn't eat anything. - Hi. - Hi... Lova! Lova! I'll kick your ass tomorrow. You'll see. Yova! Yova! Yova! Wakey-wakey! Wakey-wakey! All right. Get in here. Come on boys. Very good Lova. Everything is fine. And how about you? What was that? I know... I'll improve on that. When? Fuck that. - What's up? - What happened? Did it go off? And he's gone. Wait, the guys are coming. Bring it over here. Guys, here's the dinner I've promised. Come over here for a sausage. What the fuck? That's the end of the ride. Go on... Benuś. It's your favourite sausage. You don't have to call me twice for that. Let's get buffed up. There goes the clutch. What a flame! Gents, look what happened to me. Where are you off to Lova? Ey, what's up with you? Stop stuffing yourself ladies! It's after 6pm already. Ey, take it easy! All right. See you around. Bye. Pass me that spoke. There should be one somewhere over there. So crispy. So what, Benuś, are you ready for number four? I'll have one for our boss over there. Get strong, get buffed, eat sausage... and still be as skinny as a rail! Lovka doesn't realise what he's missing. As always... You know... He goes to his mom's for dinner. We have to manage somehow over here. Pass me those pliers. The sausage is on fire. Jędras... I can't get up... I'll never bounce back. Jędruś, get up! Lova. Lova... Shit... Shit! Get up! Shit... Lova... Lova, cos I... I envy you. You have something to life for. I don't. And I have nothing to live for. Goddamn, Jędras, get up now! Up! Come on! Jędras... All right. Do you remember when we were at school? I remember. - Do you? - Yes, I do. I'm not going anywhere! So fucking stay here if you like. Oooo! Hi. Hey. Hey. Come on. Sit down. So what? Are we friends now? We are. And you won't go crying later, when I tell you I'm sick of you? You don't get sick of friends. Easy A's. Those girls really have peas for brains. Oh? Like your precious Starlet is any different? You know. Miss umbrella! Red lips! Yeah. Well, Starlet is a different thing. Starlet go ahead. Hi five! Good morning, Riczi! - Can I? - Hop in. No fucking way! Do you fucking got to spoil everything? - Open the door! - Fuck off!!! Open the door! Get lost!!! That's all! That's all! Come on, get out of the car. Are you making sure I'm coming back home alone? I know you're out there. Would you like some tea? That's a strange way to decorate your place. So do you want some tea or not? No, thanks. Do you want to see something cool? Sure... What made you move here? My mum keeps moving all the time. But this time we're staying put. I like it here. Lovunia... Lovunia!!! Lovka! Lovka, why did it take you so long? Are you not gonna greet me properly? What then... Not even one kiss? No! Lovka, come on. Ey, Lovka! And who is this chick with you? Tell her, I can lend her a dress if she likes. So she can put some normal clothes on. Am I like her? Stop fooling around. I like being with you. Who are you talking to? Me or her? Fucking hell Jędras! Are you crazy? I'm sober! Dude! Look at that, I can do anything. I'll be faithful like your dog. Buddy, I need a man here, not a dog. All right, fuck that. Lova? Come over here for a moment. It reeks of gutter over here. Ask your friend to kindly take a shower. Leave this moron alone! Riczi, what the hell... What are you complaining for, you asshole. Show us what you've got on the track. You wiseass! You're one smart-ass motherfucker! You clumsy loser. Watch out! If I reach you, you'll finish the fucking season sooner than you wish. Loser! - Show us what you've got on the track! - Loser! Faggot! Lova! Suck my balls, you dickhead. Congratulations on the choice of the mechanic! Leave this jackass alone. You'll show him what you've got on the track. Alco-mechanic! What's going on? Duduś is dead. What are you talking about? Duduś is dead. Seriously. He had an accident. You're joking. Right? No I'm not. Man. Duduś is dead. We're not racing. We're simply don't race. The judge will decide. Our team wants to go. Guys, the judge won't call the race off. We gonna lose points. No kidding... The judge is not calling the race off. Couch, how can we race under this circumstances? Tell me. But they are going to race! - So what? - What do we care? But... That means we'd be forfeiting. What are you fools standing for like that? We're not racing. - Take it easy! - Take it easy?! They're going to ride! Let them ride alone. No kidding, we're not going - end of story! Fucking gold diggers. They'll do anything for money! Fuck it, I'm not going! Let's pack up then. We're not going, there's no way. When we says NO, it means NO! What can we do? We'll do whatever judge decides. We'll see. Hello. Judge... Black Racks are not riding. "Ladies and Gentlemen... We've just received..." "tragic news from Scandinavia." "Duduś Dudziński, Dark Racks rider..." "Died on the track in southern Sweden." "This date will remain in memory as a dark day in Dark Racks history." They say he did the final race... He rode replacing Carlson. Fuck! Why won't they cancel this race? Well, unfortunately... I don't agree. All right. - So? - I won't agree to that. Sorry. Ladies and gents, only two contestants go out to the track. Due to an exceptional situation, they refuse to partake in the race. Thus they forfeit. Judge called this outrageous decision. It's truly hard to believe. Ladies and gentlemen, this is scandalous. We have no words. Since the judge won't stop this race... we won't commentate any further. Damn it... I think I'd rather die. Everything's ok? Yeap. You got this? Yes. Take care, man. There you go... Lova! Come down here! What are you standing there for? Let's go already! Leave him alone. Duduś's funeral was today. Duduś - was he the pretty one? Yes. He was the cutest of them all. What a shame. Wasting lives on playtime like that. You should all get yourselves killed out on that race track. Lamb of God... You take away the sins of the world... Have mercy on us. Lamb of God, you take away the sins of the world... Have mercy on us. Lamb of God, you take away the sins of the world... Grant us peace. Lova... This is the Lamb of God who takes away the sins of the world. Happy are those who are called to his supper. Lord, I am not worthy... To receive you... But only say the word... And I shall be healed. In the end... We're all here but for a fleeting moment. I'm lost... I don't get it. Speedway is speedway. From the beginning, you all know... what you're getting yourselves into. It seems... I don't know how to deal with it. And I do not know how to help you either. I can't help your fear. Maybe I can not be helped. Son, your life is just beginning. Beginning or ending. Oooo! Now. That's a sin. I'm not sinning, because I don't believe. I don't believe. You don't have to believe to sin. Pass me that ignition, and we're ready right? All right. Everything looks fine. Wheel is in place! Tighten that up. All right, ignition is fixed. Fucking hell! Lova... How's it going? Ok? Are you sure? What's up with you? What the hell? Ying, ying! Yova, be cayful oy I will yun ovey you! Yova, did you win? Listen to yourself. Such a big boy and talks like that... "Ying, ying!" Yova! Yova! I yike you anyway, Yova! Even if you yost! Haven't you had enough? Of what? Of the track. Of all that anxiety... Don't ask him that question ever again. First you fall in love with them... Because they're famous. You fall for them and for their money. And then out of nowhere... You want them to give the hell up the thing they love most. Never, ever ask him to do that! But I... "But I, but I"! And you! Get out of there back to the pool. He gave up speedway racing for his missus. And then she gave up on him. He loved her so much, he would do anything for her. And he stupidly did. I'm sorry. Don't be. Just remember. Those who give up racing... for a woman - end up badly. They end up like me. But I adore you, Papa! Stop it. Get back to work Besides. What he needs right now is... peace and quiet and not a girlfriend. But we are not together. Yeah right. Get back to work now. Lova... What is it? I'm scared. I've started being afraid. Only kids aren't scared. If you're scared... That just means... You're getting old. It's perfectly normal. In fact, I'd be surprised if you weren't scared. Lovka listen closely to what I'm about to tell you. You need to have fun riding. Once the fun is gone. It no longer makes any sense. Just drop the hell with it. But if you sill want to race... Then fight for it. Yes, Coach. I'll try. This is something you have to do. Not just give it a try. And don't call me 'Coach'... You already have a coach. And it certainly isn't me. Come over for a cup of tea, man. Just think about it. You see what's happening. The boy is afraid. He can not be distracted. It depends on you... Lova? That's cool. Let's turn it off. Let's go boys. I'm putting forward you Lova and you Oldie for the dedicated race. Which position do you choose? - Couch, how about me? - Just wait... All right. Move it... move it! Off you go, there is no time. There you go! Fuck... You lost. I see you're happy about that? Well, no but... How did this happen, champ? Well... It's not easy... I'm all on my own here, nobody's helping me. I guess right now I'm in a slump. Well, I just have to deal with it somehow. The new engine failed me. I won't blame it on the equipment. Things just didn't go as well as I'd hoped. The talk with the coach could not have been easy? Well, this is irrelevant. Today I wasn't good enough. I didn't make it. What happened to that wonderful Lova... we all knew and loved? I don't know how to answer that. Thanks. - Hi. - Hi. Lunch is nearly ready. For shenanigans in bed... One must take responsibility. That's that. You wouldn't be saying that if... it was our beloved Baby who's pregnant? How do you know about that? Did Richi tell you? I didn't know until now. Well, now you know! Well then, congratulations are in order! To the mother and grandmother! Stop it. Congratulations. Mum, come on. A sweet, tiny, rosy little baby. Don't laugh! Stop that! It happens in the best families. Well, you've got yourself some daughter. Copy. Paste. Identical. Right? Exactly the same. - Bravo! - Stop it. Well done little tramp! You scored the goal! We have to do something about it. Do something? Like what? We have to do something about it. And you're going to help me. You knew very well that she was whoring around. What's with you two? Come on. I was kidding, right? That's some fucked up joke. Have fun without me. Come back! - What the hell are you doing? Come back! - Get lost! Get the fuck out with your owner! God bless. There's no Priest here. What do you mean "There's no Priest"? The Priest is here. God Bless. He left you his bike. He had no way of taking it. Why would I need a second bike? He said it might come in handy for you. Please be careful. Look who's talking. Lova! Have you seen Sugar? He went home. Well then, bye. Bye. Bye. Bye. Bye. Well... Bye. Bye then. Bye. Bye. Bye. Bye. Bye. So... - Bye. - Bye. "For now, Lova is the last one, but he's clearly accelerating." Damn you! You should rot in hell! Who drives like that! What an idiot! Damn you! You should rot in hell! Why are you saying things like that? They could really get killed on the speedway track. Take it back! Take it back. Why should I? Why so sensitive? Why? Because... Because that's my brother. "Bravo, Lova!!!" "He went all out and won!" So. We're friends, right? Well. Sure. Would you do something for a friend? Without knowing what it is? Boy or a girl? What? Do you want a boy or a girl? What do you prefer? Well then... Think about it. So next time you'll know. Lova... What's with the anger? Can you lend me some cash for an engine? I'll pay you back. Sure, I will... If you let me win on Sunday. All right... Forget I asked. Never mind. And on Sunday, you'll probably win anyway. In fact, I hope you do! As you wish. Ey! Wake up! Ey! Lovka! I found your handyman. Hush... I don't want Lova to find out. Get the hell out of here! - What do you mean? Man? - Get out! - Leave him alone. - What do you mean "leave him alone"? Don't you have something better to do? You as well? Get back to work! - I can always help with something. - Get out! - Come on, man. - Get out! Tires... Get the fuck out of my box you jerk! You finally came to your senses. What's that? - What's that?! - It's a seven. As you wanted. I have enough of you calling the shots. We either agree on something, or we don't. We do our best, so you win. But you keep changing everything all the time! Know-it-all smart asses. What a team... We do our best, so you can win man. - Yeah? - Yeah. - Hi Couch. - High five. Hi. Hiya! "Sugar loses." "So chances for Dark Racks victory are seriously diminishing." What the fuck!? Do you wanna go hard?! What the fuck? Do you wanna go hard?! Have some respect for life you moron! Have some respect! He's a jerk! "That was a very risky situation." "Let's see it one more time." It's ok. Sugar, what the fuck are you playing at?! He pissed me off, Couch! Stop acting like a child or they'll suspend you. Next time I'll go hard on him! Fuck! Ey! Get out of here kid! Benek! Benek! Getting ready! Benek! It's green! "All eyes on the prize." "This time all on Lova." "Lova takes off. It's not his best start." "Lova is in the lead," "but the rivals are still dangerous." "He fights bravely." "Lova takes the lead..." "The temperature of this race is rising." "Lova is still in the lead!" "But what a dangerous attack!" "Falling in second position..." "only to lose it again on the last centimetres of the race." He yost. "What a bad luck, what a tragic event for Dark Racks." Lovka. Mum wants you to come over. Will you come over? That's one lucky starlet. Why is it going so badly? Why does the equipment fail? What are you talking about, man? If only Polish football players, played the way we ride... This is sport... You win some, you lose some. What happened with the good shape and the dream team from last month? Okay, greetings to all who love speedway! Hop in! Your bike is in the trunk. We screwed this up. Don't even get me started. Sugar!!! Sugar!!! Stop!!! Well done, fucking losers. It's those guys who fucked up today's race. Hey man, take it easy. Take a chill pill man! Halo!! - Are you mad guys? - Calm down! Relax! And you are calling yourselves fans? Relax man! Fuck you! You man. You are done. Well, at least tomorrow they will have something to talk about. Fuck man... You are such a lame troublemaker. I'm off. Hey! My bike! Lova!! He's wasted. He'll be fine. Don't you laugh... I don't remember why... but you should not laugh. Lova... Do you know... Do you know that... Please don't bark... If only... all people could be just like dogs. One more floor up. Come on. Sugar... We need to light a candle. A candle? Papa's gone mad. Lova, what happened? Sugar... Sugar hanged himself. I could have done something. We all could have. Little Sugar found him. Papa... Lova... Promise me... You'll never even... think about it. Promise me. Bye. Bye. Sugar forever. Sugar forever. Sugar forever. Enough of that Lova. Roma? Sugar!!! Sugar!!! Give me that. Come on, give me the bottle. Lova! Loveńka! Get lost you drunk. Loveńka! Come on, buddy. Lova! Come here to... I'm a drunk? Right? Ey! Ey! What are you doing here? Lovka... And what now? That's what you wanted, didn't you? Go away now. Go away now. Something's wrong? No. Everything's all right. Yo... va! Yova!!! Yova, don't you yike me anymoye? Yova... Iowa. Iowa! Yova, I can't handye it anymoye! Yova, I can't handye it anymoye. Yova... Yova, my stomach huyts... Yova, my stomach huyts... Yova, you didn't die? No, you didn't? Aye you gonna make it? Want me to yeave? Do you? Take care man. "Let's see how will the race go" "in this most important meeting of the season." "Lova is in a yellow helmet." "He will be breaking through from last place." "He attacks phenomenally." "One more situation." "Lova takes the lead." "This is the real Lova, in his excellent shape." "The fans will remember this situation for a very long time." "Well done!!!" "Of this long-awaited gigantic success!" Lo... va! Lo... va! Lo... va! "Lova! The most beautiful days of his care..." Roma?
