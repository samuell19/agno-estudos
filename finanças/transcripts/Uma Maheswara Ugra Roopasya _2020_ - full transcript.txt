Wow! A star fruit. Dad, here is the hot water. Take your bath. KOMALI PHOTO STUDIO FREE HEALTH SERVICE You're coming home for the holidays, aren't you? Damn! I want to see you. All right. Have you had your dinner? Shall I go with my dad and talk to your parents about us? Then come home soon. Hey! Give me a kiss. Dad... Dad, come on, let's eat. Dad? Dad? Dad? Don't move. You moved when Rohit was batting last time. And he got out. Damn! He got out. I told you not to move. Keep quiet. I'm coming there. Did you inquire with your relatives? I called up all the relatives in the village. No one saw him. Maybe he's gone out of town to meet someone. We have no relatives outside this village, sir. That's not possible. How can that be? It's true, sir. His parents had a love marriage. His father left his family and moved here as they didn't agree to his marriage. And he never went back. -Did he ever go missing like this before? -No, this is the first time. Did you search the nearby wells and lakes? Goddess Durga, bring back my dad, and I'll walk on burning coal as penance. Mahesh, calm down. Sir, I think we should contact the Odisha police-- Babji, hold on. Sir, I suspect that Mr. Manohar is mentally unstable. It's your turn, old man. This world is so beautiful. What? Have you lost your mind? Babji, you are beautiful too. All right. I think you are doing just fine. Come on, joker. Damn. Sir, I need to tell you something too. What's that? We need to contact the Odisha police immediately. What for? Once, Mr. Manohar and I were sitting in my shop... Are you looking for an empty space on the wall to hang your photo? Babji, we both used to attend those raunchy dance shows in Chuchukonda. Do you remember? How can I forget? They had always been a feast for the eyes. I want to see it one more time. Shall we go? They have stopped performing in Chuchukonda. If we go to Jeypore in Odisha, we can watch new shows featuring new girls. Transport is available from Padwa. I too would like to go there. Why don't we plan a trip? Don't look at me like that. We shouldn't lie to the doctors and the police. Such secrets won't help us in this situation. I had to tell him. Okay, I'll investigate and let you know. Don't panic in the meantime. You can go now. Thank you, Officer. Sir, please search harder. Sir, if you can't find him, please contact the Odisha police. Dad? Dad. -What are you doing here? -What's the matter, son? I couldn't find you. I was so worried. You fool. There's nothing to worry about. Mahesh, where are you? Here... Here I am. Everyone thinks that you have gone crazy, Dad. What were you doing in the bushes? I was looking out for birds. Get some sleep, Dad. Make some room, Dad. Who is it? My name is Suhas. I'm here to meet Mr. Babji. Dad is taking a bath. Please come in. -Can I leave my slippers here? -Yeah, leave them there. Are you a fan of NTR? No. I love Mahesh Babu. I am a fan of NTR. Mahesh Babu kills his villains without even moving his feet. Very lazy. But NTR hunts the villains down. So crazy. Hey, don't call him lazy. Mahesh is a classy man. My guy is a hero to the masses. Look at him take that bad guy out. That's my man. The bad guys shudder when he enters. -Who's that? -Mr. Babji. Dad, go put a shirt on. Don't come in half-naked. Greetings, sir. -Are you Korra Bujayya's son? -Yes. Come on. Your dad told me everything. What did you use to do before? I used to sell Bamboo chicken near the Borra Caves. -Then why did you stop that? -Once it used to be a special dish. Now every jobless guy in the village is selling Bamboo chicken. Whatever I do, I want it to be special. I want to learn traditional bone setting from you and become a specialist one day. Your hair looks like the tail of a wild gecko. What happened on this side? Suffered lice bites in my childhood. Hair doesn't grow much here. Damn! Oh, God! Can't you see that I'm in pain? Don't you have compassion for a man who's suffering? How can I set bones if I show compassion, sir? Come and meet me at the clinic tomorrow. -Okay. -Listen. I am heading towards the town. I'll drop you. Oh, God. The guy is so weird. Hello, Mr. Venkat Rao. Cutting jackfruits? No, I'm laying eggs. Want some? No, thanks. You can have them. This 80-year-old prick is quite sarcastic. Maybe the east wind is affecting his mind. Rather than roaming around like a lunatic, why don't you take care of my banana plantation? Yeah, sure. Hey, Karuna! How are you? -I'm doing good. How are you? -Great. Mahesh, I need passport-size photos. Come on. Let's click some great photos. I heard that you're moving back to India. I want to move back here. But not right now. I bought farmland with a loan from the bank. I have to work abroad until I can repay it. Oh. What about you? When are you getting married? -I'll most likely get married this year. -Don't delay it. People might start talking about you. You're already 30. You got married at 25 and got two kids. We can't live our lives if our decisions are dependent on others' opinions. -We have a coat. -Don't need it. You carry on. Please sit. Sit. Please look here. Chandru, this is a passport-size photo. Come here. Come on. Chin down, a little bit. That's you. I made you look a little fairer. You look handsome. Let's go. Bye. Babji, shall we have lunch? I'm with a patient. It's almost done. Keep in mind, this bandage must stay on for 30 days. -If it starts hurting, call me. -Okay. Or just come here. -What did you cook? -Tapioca fry. -Serve me some. -Yeah, please have it. What was your dad doing in the bushes when you found him? Looking for birds... -I have no idea. -Don't worry. It's because of his old age. You need to keep an eye on him. Venkat Rao is amazing. He's older than your dad. He still climbs jackfruit trees to cut fruits. He's quite strong even at the age of 80. But he's such a sarcastic jerk. I hope he falls out of a tree one day, breaks his leg, and comes to me for treatment. Who is that Venkat Rao? Are you kidding me? He's your girlfriend's uncle. Venkat Rao. Mahesh. Hey, Mahesh. What happened? Your girlfriend's uncle, Venkata Rao... He fell from a tree. Did he break his leg? No. He broke his head and died on the spot. He never wanted to be photographed. Now his family doesn't have any picture of his. They want you to take photos of his mortal remains. I'm coming. Babji, I'm going there. Are you coming? Yeah, I'm coming. Children, I told you to collect funds for tsunami relief. -Did you do it? -Yes, ma'am. Okay, come one by one and submit the money. Let's start with the boys. Swathi, how much did you collect? I haven't collected anything, Mahesh. I'll tell you what. I have collected 300 rupees. Let's split it in half. The others will laugh at us for collecting such a small amount. It's okay. You can take the entire 300. It's your turn. -I haven't collected a dime, ma'am. -Nothing at all? Wastrel. Sit down. -Mom, walk fast. -Yeah, I'm trying. They have already started it. Careful, dear. You didn't leave yet, Babji? I stayed back, in case you needed some help. He was quite good at climbing trees. He had a strong physique. -Is the cooking done? -20 more minutes. Just recently... Want to have a drink, Babji? Are you blind? I am working. You can carry on. He wanted me to work out and become fit. So that we could have kids again. And now he dropped dead. I've got a call from the hospital. I have to take this. -Is she here on leave? -Yes. -Did she fly here? -Yes. The old jerk's death disrupted all our lives. Why did he have to climb trees? What is it? Now? No way. What if someone sees me sneaking out? How can I? There are many people here. Mister, shall I remove this? -Yeah, go on. -Okay. "Action." -What happened? -He's having a heart attack. Babji... Let's get him into my ambulance. He might die before he reaches the hospital. Put him on that table. -Careful... -Look out. -Hold his leg. -Careful. -Babji, are you okay? -What happened to him? Move aside. Let me take a look. -What happened? -Looks like gastric pain. In that case, he should be holding his stomach, not his heart. It's a heart attack. We need to carry out CPR. -What the hell is CPR? -I'll show you. I handled lots of such cases when I was in the army. Don't panic. Spread out the arms. Not yours, fools! His arms. When I tell you, press your mouth against his -and blow air into his mouth. -Okay. Don't put your mouth against mine. Watch me and learn. Unbutton the shirt, and make sure he gets air. Now you need to give compressions on his chest. Don't press so hard. He might die. Mahesh? Mahesh? Where are you taking me? I'm not wearing my slippers. Ants bit my legs. Why did you come now? There are many people here. We'll be done for if someone sees us. -Did you eat anything? -No. I just had some tea. -What's that? -Your favorite snacks. Wow! It's been so long since I ate this. -Tastes good? I made them for you. -Tastes great. You have completely turned into a Hyderabadi girl. I missed you, Swathi. Shut up! I might puke my heart out. Stop! Oh, God. This is not helping. Give him mouth-to-mouth. No mouth-to-mouth. No... See how my CPR saved him. Shut the hell up. CPR, my foot! Let's take him to the hospital in my ambulance. I'm all right. It's just the spicy dishes I ate for dinner. It gave me this gastric trouble. Do you want me to drop you at home? No, thanks! You've already dropped a whole lot of crap in my mouth. Taking alcohol after CPR produces side effects. I said that it's just a gastric problem. You guys didn't listen to me and kept thumping his chest. Now enjoy the aroma as he breaks wind. Those bastards thumped my chest as if it were a punching bag. Hey! Thanks, Babji. It worked out well. Take your hand off me. You are still breathing because I came up with this stupid idea. If they had continued with their treatment, I might have farted my life out. Get inside the house. Dear. David Raju has found you a suitor. They are from Paderu. David says that they are a really nice family. The boy is an engineer in America. They want to come here and see you. I said that I needed to ask you first. I really think it's a great match. You are educated and have much more worldly wisdom than I do. Do you want to live your entire life here, eating your favorite snacks? Or do you want to go around the world and enjoy your life? Think about it. Suhas. Suvas... It means a nice aroma, right? No, sir. It's Suhas. It means a good laugh. Whatever. If anyone gets into a fight in this town, or meets with an accident, or slips in the bathroom, or falls from a tree and breaks his bone... Do you know what they scream? They scream my name. It's nothing new. My family is well-known for practicing traditional bone setting. That's my grandfather, Guruji. The pioneer who treated white people back in those days. That's my father, Pedda Brahmaji. That's my uncle, Chinna Brahmaji. And then, this Babji. You are lucky to learn the skills from a teacher like me. Take blessings from those teachers first. And then from this teacher. And get to work. Dad, give me hundred rupees. Hundred rupees? What for? I have given you a job since I know your dad. Know your limits and keep away from trouble, okay? -Babji, please watch over my shop. -Where are you going? -There is a wedding in a nearby town. -I'm going there to take photos. Careful, it might rain. Do you recognize me? I'm Suhas. You scored 20 runs in the final over in a cricket match in Hukumpet. -Yes. -I bowled that over. -You are Korra Prabhas's... -I'm Korra Suhas, his brother. We played on the ground next to the power station. As my friends were blaming me for losing the match, you gave back the money we bet on that game. I wanted to thank you right then, but I couldn't. It's okay. -What's with that hairstyle? -This is the new hairstyle in Araku now. -Lice bites from my childhood. -Oh. By the way, they said that you went off to Vizag because of some issues. That's right. I tied firecrackers to the tail of a dog that had been barking all day. It became a serious offense. Then I ran away to Vizag. But it really helped. I learned many things about life. -I need to go. -I'll be here, bro. -Mr. Babji has given me a job. -Okay. Why didn't you tell me this until now? Unlike yours, my personal history isn't something to be proud of. Great teachers. Can I keep my bag inside, sir? Are you blind or what? -You were the one who was speeding. -Shut up! Do you want a fight? It's okay. It's my mistake. You carry on. Idiot. Get lost. Chandru, remove all the chairs. They are blocking the way. Okay. They told me that the ceremony is at 11:05. It's at 11:05 PM, not now. -11:05 PM? -Yes. -I got it wrong then. -Where are you going? I need to get back to my studio. Wait, have some tea and bananas. Come on. -Okay. -Come on. Do you want to take a photo with your wife, old man? I want a photo with your wife. Don't be so sarcastic. That's why your cousin fell from a tree and died. -You be careful then. -Why should I be careful? -You are the one in a tree now. -Can't argue with an old jerk. The bananas have arrived. Go and gulp down a few. Bears are roaming around the village. Be careful. -Yeah, Babji told me. -Can you get me some bananas? -Get some bananas here. -Here you go. -I'll get some for him. -It's okay. I just had breakfast. -Have some. -I'm good. These bananas taste so good. -Don't they? -Yes, very tasty. -They are from Karuna's plantation. -From where? Karuna's plantation. Chandru... You should inform me when you get the fruits from that plantation. They didn't want to tell you. Keep quiet. Karuna asked me to take care of the plantation. What should I tell him now? -What? He asked you? -Yes. Not just the plantation, he asked me to take care of his entire property. No one entrusts a fool to look after their property. He asked me to take care of his plantation. How dare you call me a fool! You steal in your own house to play cards. -How can anyone trust you? -Don't make me mad. -I'll make you mad. What will you do? -Stop it. -What can you do... -Chandru... -We have a wedding here. -This old guy is talking too much. -Stop it. -What will you do? -Don't touch me. -Cut the crap. -I'm going to kill you, old fool. -I dare you! -I swear, I'll kill you. -Don't you talk to me like that. Stop it! Shut up. Sit down. Shame on you. We're going to have a wedding here. Morons. Shame on you! Get away. -Have you gone mad? -I haven't gone mad. You have gone mad. You want to take over the plantation. -How dare you accuse me like that! -Yes, that's what you want. I'll do whatever I want. -That's my plantation. -Listen to yourself. Shut up. -How can it be yours? -You old fart! Stop it, guys. -He says that is his plantation. -You can't hit him. That's my plantation. Ring him up. Call Karuna now. Where should I keep this? Go there and ask him. -Sir, where should I keep this? -Put it in the prayer room. -Hit him with it. -Keep dialing! I'll shove it up your ass. -I don't have prepaid balance. -So, you can't even make a call. But you want to show the whole world how tough you are. Tell me the number. Who's calling at this odd hour? It's from India. Hello, who's this? I'm Nancharayya, a member of the village council. What's the matter, Nancharayya? Appanna and Chandru are having a fight. Whom did you put in charge of your banana plantation? Chandru. Why do you ask? Let's talk about it later. International calls are expensive. Got it? How dare you accuse me of trying to steal the plantation? Come on, go about your work. What's with Chandru? Nothing. He asked me who's taking care of the banana plantation. I said that it's Chandru. What? My uncle, Appanna, has been taking care of our properties for years. Chandru has no job. I put him in charge of our plantation so that he can earn and prosper in life. When you went to India alone, I knew you'd do something foolish like this. What does it matter now? Get back to sleep. Let's talk in the morning. Sleep. Try to sleep. Chandru! What the hell! Oh, God! Why are you hitting yourself now? -What do you want now? -Absolutely nothing. Actually, he put me in charge of the plantation. I never knew about his new arrangement with this guy. Calm down, Appanna. Take it easy. Why do you both have to fight over someone else's property? It's Karuna again. Nanchari... My wife, Brinda, wants Appanna to be in charge of the plantation. Ask Appanna to take up the responsibility. Okay. He wants Appanna to take care of it. Did you hear that, boy? You can't fool Karuna with your cunningness, boy. You are such a fool, Karuna. Why did you mention my name? You wanted Chandru out. Now if Chandru tells this to your mother, she'll lash out at me. She's already telling the entire village that I boss you around. There's nothing to worry about. Please, try and get some sleep. You strut around the entire village and pretend to be a noble and generous man. And I come across a spiteful devil. Right? Come on, call them again. Do it! Hey, I will... I will call them. Calm down, don't shout. -Did you bring the required utensils? -Yes. -Get back to work. -Okay. Nanchari, leave the plantation under Chandru's care. By the way, I make all the important decisions, not my wife. Fickle-headed jackass. How many times will you change your decision? Can't you decide on someone? -Who the hell are you, dumbass? -What? Who the hell am I? I'm the one who goes to bed with your mom. Didn't your mom tell you that? Asshole. How dare you talk to my cousin like that? He's my family, you know. -You... -Get lost. Nanchari, what did you do about our request for new bathrooms? Get lost. You and your shitty bathrooms. Can't you see? Get up. Look at what you did. -It's not me. -No, it's you. -It's him. -Who will pay for this? -Not my fault. -Yes, it is. Look there. -I didn't do it. -My fruits got ruined. -It is his fault. -No, you did this. You have to... Hey... Stop! Stop... Stop, I say. Stop. Wow, star fruits! My fruits... Don't take my fruit. Stop... Give my fruits back... Susi, get some water. Susi? Susi? Susi? What are you doing? Why are you acting crazy? I'll slap you if you annoy me now. My husband is trying to beat me to death. Have you gone mad or what? Shut up and go away, or you will meet your maker. -What? -Go away. -Do you want bamboo chicken? -I have had enough of it. Panduraju is trying to kill your sister. -God, he's killing me. -Haven't you left yet? Is he hitting her? Why? Give me two tobacco packets. Please top up my prepaid mobile balance. It's urgent. -Tell me the number. -Hey, I'm waiting. Hey, I've been waiting. Serve me first and then attend to him. -Hey, how dare you push me? -Hey. -How dare you? -What? Don't you talk to me like that. I'll kick your ass, bastard... You crazy bugger. -I'm going to kill you. -Don't make me smash your face. -Hey, what's happening? -You old piece of crap! -Don't make a scene, mister. -I'll kill you, you old fool. -Get lost. -What do you think of me... Go ahead. I'm going to kill you, you piece of shit. What the hell is wrong with you, man? Let's go. -I'll kill him. -You just got out of jail. -Enough. -I'll kill him. -Calm down. -Come on, get in. Son of a bitch. How dare you attack my boss? Shaggy bastard. What the hell! I'll kill you all. He attacked Babji. -Please calm down, man. -How dare he... Please calm down. Hey, Mahesh. Hit him back. Get back on your feet. Did you crack your skull? Boy, stop it. He lost. And you won. Now, let him go. Let's go, guys. Check if he suffered any serious injury. You are a sissy. Help him. Move aside... Make way. -I'll get his slippers. -Hold on. Move... Put on your slippers, bro. Put on your slippers. Put on your slippers. You can't walk barefoot. Mahesh, calm down. Put on your slippers. Mahesh... Put on your slippers. I will walk barefoot until I pay him back in kind. Move away. Take off the pants. Hold on. Careful. Sit down. Let me take a look at your leg. Easy. Is it paining here? Here, right? It got sprained. Go get some herbal oil. There is a jar on the third shelf. Bring it here. I'm sure he's a gangbanger. Oh, God. Why should we care who he is? My cheek has swollen up, and I'm not able to eat. The pain will go away within two weeks. Don't worry. Things like this keep happening at times. We should never get into a fight without gauging the opponent's strength. You have known me since I was a kid. Have you ever seen me getting into a fight with anyone in the village? Did you at least hear me yell at anyone? Never. You will soon see what happens when a gentle-mannered guy gets angry. Get ready to witness Uma Maheshwara's fury. Mahesh, why are you uttering such dramatic dialogues? Nancharayya, stop drinking and talk to him. I have decided not to get involved in matters that don't concern me. It was just a few people who witnessed the whole thing. It's crazy of you to walk barefoot until you avenge what happened there. -Listen, Mahesh... -I'm my father's son. The man who's sitting there. He's Manohar Rao. That's my dad. Are you awake, Swathi? Swathi? Dad wants you to enjoy a good life. I know. Please don't start it again. Hush. Your sister is sleeping. I'm your mother. You don't have to hide anything from me. I know what you are going through. Hug me tightly. Cry all your pain out and forget him. Cry all your pain out. My mom used to say that thoughts and memories are the heaviest burdens. Cry them out as tears, and your heart will feel lighter. -Do you think he's home? -His bike is here. He must be home. Mahesh, please come out. -What is it, Dad? -They want to talk to you about something. What happened to your face? -It's nothing. -Okay. What's the matter? -Why don't you tell him? -No, Brother. You should tell him. I know what's going on between you and my daughter. I have known you since you were a boy. You are a really nice guy. But she's got a good suitor. She had always wanted to marry you. But now she is confused. Here is the phone. She's on the line. If you both can talk it out and come to an understanding... Mahesh? Yes. I'm really confused, Mahesh. I don't know if I can ever forget you. But... But I think this is for our own good. Are you breaking up with me? I'm not saying that. All that I'm saying is, I'm confused. You are confused? So you have many options. Okay. Don't feel guilty. Nothing hurts as bad as guilt does. Let's go. Bro, I need... Are you removing the photos? That's better. It's nothing. These photos are just for display. So they amount to nothing, right? Hey. Don't say that. -What do you want? -I want two passport-size photos. Come on. -What do you need them for? -To open a bank account. Sit. I read a story in a magazine last night. The protagonist kills a man out of vengeance and gets jailed. His girlfriend moves on to another man. His sister finds it difficult to survive and becomes a prostitute. Her father becomes her pimp. After a few years, the protagonist gets out of jail. And when he's begging on the streets, a bad guy comes and stabs him. That's it. The end. I was thinking about you while I was reading that story. Do we need to seek vengeance? There's nothing to say. I seek vengeance. Wonderful! I was just testing you. His name is Jognath. He works at a welding shop in Hukumpet. Let's go get him. Are you wearing a lungi? Make sure it doesn't come off. He tore your pants when he attacked you. Let's smash him to a fine pulp. Let's go. Mahesh is going to thrash that guy now. -Is it? -Mahesh is going to fight with that guy. Uncle, Mahesh is going to challenge him to a fight. -Where is he going to? -He's going to fight with that guy. He's going to fight with that guy. Get me a pair of nine-inch slippers. Give me a pair of nine-inch slippers. Mahesh is going to fight that guy. Is he? Let's go. Let me join you, guys. Don't walk on the road. Keep to the sides. Come on. Hey, don't you understand what I'm saying? Get off the road. Mahesh... -Mahesh... -Mahesh is going to attack him. -Really? -I don't want to get involved. -Let me join you. -Let's go, guys. Don't leave the ritual incomplete. It's bad luck. Subbi... Wait. SRI MODAMAMBA WELDING WORKS Uncle, beat the drums. Mahesh is going to kick him in the balls. Give me the hammer. -What do you want? -Is Jognath here? He left for Dubai. He got a job there. PADERU, VISAKHAPATNAM DISTRICT Wash your hands properly and close the tap. Bring us some tea, boy. I have only 20 rupees, master. Bring a couple of samosas too. How is your hand now? Excuse me. Where can I find kun fu master Girish? Hello, master. Hi, who are you? My name is Korra Pongidora. I'm from the town called G. Madugula. Have a seat. I'm here because... I want to beat up a few guys, master. I want to learn kun fu from you. It's called kung fu, not kun fu. And such martial arts are only for self-protection, not to attack people. I want to protect myself. That's why I want to learn it. My sister-in-law is a college student. Some guys were clicking pictures of her and harassing her. So she began to hire cabs to get back home from college. A cab driver misbehaved with her. I went to warn him, and he knocked me down and beat me. -Bring the samosas, boy. -Coming. I'm disgusted at myself as I'm not able to help my sister-in-law. Let's welcome our new student, Pongidora. Hepzibah, help Pongidora to warm up. Now let's do leg raises. Oh, God! -Are you hurt? -Are you okay? Are you okay, mister? Move aside, guys. Mahesh, get up. It's hurting, master. Only when you are dead, you won't feel pain. Where there is life, there is pain. You are not dead yet. Get back on your feet. Go back to your positions. Come on, one more. Come on, Mahesh. Mahesh, give me a lift. I have to attend a wedding. Hop on. Let's go. Whose wedding? Yesupadam's daughter, Swathi, is getting married. Marriage is a sacred bond. God sanctioned this union and blessed it. Michael, do you wholeheartedly accept Swathi as your wife? I do. Swathi, do you wholeheartedly accept Michael as your husband? I do. Do you get Indian food in America? Yeah, we even get biryani in Wall Street. What's Wall Street? It's a small street in New York. Let me pass, please. Give way. Move aside, please. -Make way, please. -It's okay, Uncle. You don't have to do this. Sorry. Let me wash hands. -Come, let's go. -I'm coming. Where are you going, son? To the shop, Dad. You can go once the rain stops. Sit down. Don't call it a shop. It's a studio. Mahesh... Two people unite. Two souls get separated. How long can you blame the soul that can't even be seen? If you don't let go of those who wanted to leave, their presence doesn't bring you any joy. Mithila. I'll pay you later. -What are you doing here? -I'm going to my class. I'm running an errand for your dad. What happened to your braces? -They are in my bag. You want them? -You have crooked teeth. You need them. -Want to have a drink? -No, I'm getting late. I need to go. Me too. Bye. See you. -How's the movie? -It's okay. Get in. Sounds like a flop to me. Let me pass, please. Don't stare at me like that. You have got a nice classroom. -Don't tell my dad. -You too. Why do you want to see Mahesh Babu's film? I want to slam the film on Twitter if it doesn't impress me. You are on Twitter? I roast his films through fan pages. I'll do the same to your favorite actor. You are not even on Twitter. Watch the movie. -Bring tea. -"A ghastly incident took place in Vizag." "A father committed suicide as his daughter eloped with her lover." Hey, what are you staring at? -Checking if he's wearing... -Checking if he's wearing an underwear? No. Slippers. I'll beat the hell out of you. Get lost. Get me some snacks. -Don't tell your dad. -You too. -Excuse me. -Yes. -Where is Jognath's house? -Jogi's house? Yeah. Go through that coffee plantation and take left. -Can I have a lemonade? -We don't have it. -Do you want a soft drink? -Sure. Here you go. -Where are you from? -Araku. Araku? Do you know the guy who's walking barefoot after getting thrashed by Jognath? I don't know. -Did you see him beat that guy? -No. I heard people talk about it at length. -How much? -Twenty rupees. -Take the bottle. -Keep it. -Bro. -Yes? Do people from your village walk barefoot to show solidarity with that guy? It's part of my religious penance. -What religious penance is that? -What a nosy guy! He opened the bottle. Who's that? Is this Jognath's house? Yes. Who are you? I'm his friend. Have a seat. I'll be back in a minute. What brings you here? I saw in the news that they are sending our people back because of some problem in the Gulf. How is our Jogi doing there? -Oh, God! -Don't worry. I think he will be okay. They can't send everyone back. He used to fight with others all the time when he was here. We are at peace after he left. I called him last night. He said nothing about the situation there. -Okay. I need to go. -Wait a minute. -I made tea for you. -No, thanks. I need to... Please wait. I'll get it. Where are you from? I never saw you before. Mom! God, she's here. I'll be back. -Mom! -What is it? Is there nothing to eat? I made your favorite snacks. I served them to your brother's friend. You know that I'll be hungry after returning from college. I know. Wait, I'll prepare them again. You should've just served tea. You didn't have to feed him. Hush! He might hear you. I'm so hungry. Ma'am, I'm leaving. It seems you are the hungriest person in the whole world. You need to learn to behave like a grown-up. -Show some respect to guests. -Hey, oldie. No one will visit our house if you act like that. Damn! I thought I could live in peace as your brother left for Dubai. But you are driving me crazy. I'm not able to deal with you. Will you ever listen to me? Jyothi, you know what? Kalpana is sending her photo to a magazine competition. I told her about the competition. I have already sent mine. Really? Mithila... Please move aside. Is there any photo studio in Araku? Yeah, Mahesh's studio. Why do you ask? I want to take some photos of mine for a magazine cover. Oh. You are all over me, girl. Why don't you sit on my lap instead? Thank you, lady. -How can I help you? -I want to take some photos of mine. -Please come in. -Mahesh, are you coming? -What? -Let's have some fresh snacks. I have a customer. I'll join you later. You are Jyothi, right? Yes. How do you know? Mithila keeps talking about you. How is she related to you? She's is his sister. Mr. Babji is kidding. Mithila is his daughter. I'm just a friend of hers. -Are you Suhas? -Yeah. Korra Suhas. Mithila has told me about you. NTR is your favorite movie star, right? I like NTR too. Mahesh is waiting for you. Nice to meet you. Let's meet again. Okay, bye. Can we have the slippers on? Can we have the slippers on? I don't wear them as my foot is injured. No, I'm asking if I can come in wearing slippers. Oh! It's okay, come in. Why do you have Swathi's photos here? They are just for display. Come in. I can click the photos when you are ready. Please sit. There. I don't want a passport-size photo. I want to send the photo to a magazine competition. Come here, please. These poses look good, right? Okay. Why didn't you say that first? Need to adjust the lighting. Can you show it again? Look here. Can you please stand? The background will look good. A little more to the left. Can you pull your back? It will look good. Chin up, a little. A little. Okay. Reducing the opacity, adding dodge effect, and increasing the sharpness... The picture will look great. Let's make it a little fairer. In what size do you want the copy? Look at that picture. Do you even know photography? Amateurs can click far better photos. You know that? If you don't know how to take nice photos, you should have told me. Hey... Hey, lady. Hold on. I'm a member of Vishaka Photographers Association. And she said that I can't click photos. Maybe those photos came out bad. Those photos looked good. She doesn't know about photography. Don't take her seriously. I reduced the opacity and tried to balance the colors. I increased the sharpness too. I clicked exactly the way she wanted it. Don't know why she didn't like it. "If you kill, you'll get killed too." He got his neck sprained. For the treatment that costs 50 bucks, the corporate hospital billed the guy 50 thousand. He came to us as he can't afford that. Take a look. He'll be here tomorrow. Ask him to apply this oil three times a day. Give me the next X-ray. -Babji. -Yes. Am I a bad photographer? I have no idea about photography. So, I can't say. -Not this. The other one. -Okay, bye. Do we have any of these bandages left? -Do we need to order them? -Yes. Okay. Dad! Dad, come, let's go. Dad? Why are you trying to remove it? I want to add color to the photo and keep some flowers around it. I'll break your hands if you ever touch that photo again. Mahesh, you have the emotion to sustain your thirst for revenge. You're taking kung fu lessons to improve your fighting skills. You have the skills to be a photographer. But something is missing. -Dad. -Yes. Teach me how to capture that emotion, Dad. Mahesh, you can't learn an art by taking lessons. You have to live for it. Here. Look here... Look here, baby. Here... Come on, look here... Yeah, that's it. Look here... Mustard flowers. Excellent. How do you get these ideas, bro? When it comes to these things, I have always been ingenious. -What does that mean? -I mean, I'm a creative person. What happened? Sit down, bro. Let me take a look at it. You're walking among bushes without shoes. Is this your creativity? -See, it's bleeding. -Shut up. Let's go. Only God knows when that guy will return and when you'll have your revenge. Thank God you chose to keep your clothes on. POST OFFICE, ARAKU COLONY Mahesh... Dad, reduce the volume. Mahesh... Mahesh... Mr. Uma Maheshwara Rao. Mahesh... Mahesh... Mr. Uma Maheshwara Rao. Mahesh... Oh, God! What happened? Let me take a look. -Let me... -It's okay. Why did you jump like a startled hare? Wait, don't move. It's not right to click my pictures without asking me. So, this is your punishment. Since your intentions are not bad, I forgive you and remove this splinter. You wrongly sent the photo to a magazine called Swathi. But still they published the photo on the cover. So they must have liked it. I'm not saying this because it's my photo. The photo looks so beautiful. Thank you. You criticized my work that day. No one had ever commented so harshly on my photography before. Now, I can tell you. You are amazing. Thanks. Sorry. Dad, I clicked this photo on the magazine cover. SWATHI No, Dad. It's inspiration. -Did you notice something? -Notice what? That cute guy in the Komali Studio has been eyeing me for many days. What nonsense! Maybe you should get your eyes checked. -He's eyeing me. -I see. -Things are getting out of hand. -What happened? -Jyothi went to Mahesh's house. -Is it? Yes. She even removed a splinter. -From his leg? -No, I removed a thorn from his leg. She removed the splinter from his hand, and he's smitten with her. What's she like? Will she cheat him? Not at all. Why are you worried about it? Of course, I will be. She won't cheat, right? No! She's not like that. This time we need to be careful. Mahesh is an innocent guy. He thinks everyone is good at heart. Yeah, tell me. I think... I have a feeling that we are going to fall in love very soon. It's better to be clear in the beginning rather than later. Go on. Firstly, Mithila told me about Swathi. Her mother and my mother are cousins. Let's not talk about all that. It's irrelevant to us. In a way, you are lucky that she left you. Secondly... I was in a relationship, too. I won't like it if you question me about my past whenever we fight. -Who was it? -I just told you not to question me. Thirdly... You had a fight with Jognath. I'm his younger sister, Jyothi. Otherwise... We can just leave it here and now. I'm waiting at the bus stop near your studio. I'll take them down if you don't like them. Why didn't my photos come out so well the first time? Now I can click great pictures of you. -Yes, Suhas? What is it? -Bro... There were two other crooks with Jognath that day. They are here. I told you before. My fight is with Jognath. Had I wanted to beat his friends, I would have done it long ago. Let's wait for him. What an idiot! Who is this guy? -Who are you? -Who are you? -Tell me who you are. -Who are you? I'm Korra Suhas... Don't do it, you crazy! Mr. Babji... Someone thrashed Jognath's friends. Their bones are broken. God does exist. There is no God! If He existed, he wouldn't have created disloyal dogs like you. What are you saying? Get up. What happened, sir? What were you and Mithila doing at the theater yesterday? -We went to the movies. -Hey! Why did you go see a movie with my daughter? -If you come back, I'll gouge your eyes... -Stop it. Don't talk about it with Mithila. Don't question her. She might lose her respect for you. I quit. I resign. Parents of a girl foolishly think that every boy is a rogue. It'd help this society if they learned to trust their daughters instead. You doubted your daughter's virtue. You should be ashamed. I never thought that you'd stoop so low. You jump to conclusions the minute a girl talks with a boy. You might think of me as a rogue. But Mithila... She's so pure. She considers me her brother. With such filth in your mind, none of those Gods on your wall and your prayers can help you. Suhas... The last guy who worked here misbehaved with my daughter. So I was suspicious about you. GURUJI'S TRADITIONAL BONE SETTING We have admitted grandma to the hospital again. They say that she might not make it. If anything happens, I'll let you know. Are you still continuing with your penance? Tomorrow is the last day. Are you going on a pilgrimage? Where to? -To your village. -Our village? Which temple will you visit in our village? Where do you go to apply that sacred ash on your face? I don't go to temples. My wife smears it on my face. Come here. My brother is back. But not because my grandma died. He attacked his supervisor, and they fired him. Are you scared? I know kung fu. Of course, I have seen you getting your ass kicked. That's just practice. It's not funny. My brother is crazy. You might get hurt. Once we get married, you can always hit him back. No one can mock you. Careful, Brother. It's okay. You guys can keep talking. -You can speak your heart out. -Go on. -Look at him, Brother. -Yeah. -It seems he's after this girl now. -Thank God my daughter is not here. Yes. I beg you, Mahesh. Don't create a scene here. Mahesh, are you listening to me? What the hell! Mahesh. Those who never tasted pain, love to inflict it on others. Those who tasted pain, hesitate to raise a hand against others. It's time for him to taste pain. Babji... Are you free tomorrow? There... There he is. Jognath. My name is Uma Maheshwara Rao. Do you remember attacking me in Araku? I took a vow that I'd walk barefoot until I pay you back in kind. I hope you are healthy and strong. Hey... You have lost your mind, Mahesh. Come on. Mom... Men are so stupid, right? You are right. And that stupidity knows no bounds. Anyway, where is this coming from? Get him! Mahesh, come on! Mahesh, get up! Thrash him, Mahesh. Mahesh... Hey, we should have called the entire village. Why did you call only me? Everyone would have seen it. They would've just stood on the sides and watched us hitting each other. They didn't have to see it. The word travels fast. These people have seen it. Soon the whole town will know. Swamy Naidu. Give me nine-inch slippers. They say he thrashed you in front of a crowd. People are asking me if you have learned your lesson finally. It's so embarrassing. How many times did I tell you not to get into fights? You never listened to me. You are suffering now. -By the way, who is that guy? -Hey! It pains because of the bruises. I've got bruises, too. Heard that your hand is sprained. If it doesn't heal faster, Babji can fix it up in no time. He mended my injuries within a few days. Why don't you go to him, son? Someone hit him too hard. His shoulder is dislocated. I'm not a great fighter or something. But I had no other option. Sorry. -Is this the guy who beat you up? -Yes, it was me. Jyothi and I are in love with each other. I want to marry her. Wow! Sounds so great! What do you say, Jognath?
