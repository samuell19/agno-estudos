The history teacher told us about it There was a time when women ruled men That was a very good time, it's a pity I forgot its name - Matriarchy? - Wow, you know it too! Men were good boys, but then the ancient women let them out And now they command us Katya! Are you crazy? You'll get cold, put your coat on, immediately A commander Nadya, The order, for the room, look! Girls, look Real, stamped, let me take a look Be careful girls, it's a document A document is a good thing, but we need to move in ASAP We should at least put a stool there Otherwise someone else may move in then only the court will help us - Ksan Ksanych... - I know what I'm doing Go to your dorm and get some of your stuff Sashka! Are we going to live up a pole? - Ksan Ksanych got his order - We'll get one by spring too, you see? A good man, Ksan Ksanych. Caring and hard working My Sashka can only play accordion I've no idea why I love him - What about you? - I hate him - But you told us you love him - But now I hate him again Where's he now? Look... Sashka, Ksan Ksanych, even Filya. But where's he? Haven't you seen him? I'd like to see him Hey, Kislitsina, take the nails over there - What for? - They have no nails Come on! Who needs nails? Call this "no nails"? Why no nails? There's a whole box A conspiracy? Let me go! Let me! - We're sitting here like adults - We are adults Nobody can stop us if we decide to get married tomorrow - Tomorrow? - Why should we delay? - What a family it will be? Husband Ilya, wife Tosya - Ridiculous - And you're foolish - You are so arrogant - One cheek kiss please Can't you live without kisses? - Really? - Of course I can't. It's not love without There's all kinds of gossip about us and I've never kissed you People would laugh Ok Now what? - No - Come on - I am ashamed to tell - You can tell me anything You know, I was thinking before... How do people kiss? Their noses should get in the way And now I see they don't You're still a little girl. Are you cold? Come here You shouldn't be too proud of yourself. Some guys behave like kings after they kiss a girl And that offends us, understand? What now? Now I remember my father. When I feel good I always think of him for some reason He died and can't be glad for me now He only knew that my mother was having a baby But he didn't know who: a boy or a girl. He died in the war He didn't know I was born. A pity. Look at them, in day time too! Stop it, or there'll be no more new rooms this year Ok ok, go away Now you kiss me. I've kissed you so many times already. It's your turn now No Ilya, I'm afraid Later If we do everything today, we'll have nothing left for tomorrow We will (c) Copy?Right! Subs revised by Corvusalbus
