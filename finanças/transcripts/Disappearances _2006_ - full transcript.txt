Who died? No one. The world is out of joint, William. Can you go any slower, ratty? You gotta hit this just right. This goes against nature, Quebec bill. Ah spring comes too damn late up here. This will trick the trees, ratty. Thaw things out. You watch. We're gonna make rain. Here she comes, Mr. A nice warm shower to green things up. This don't look good. Woah oh, look at that. Remain standing, William. And recite. Let's get started. Paradise lost by John Milton. Him, the almighty power, hurled headlong flaming from the ethereal sky. With... Aunt cordelia? Tell me the point of the poem. I didn't know it had a point. Everything has a point. You just need to know how to look for it. Paradise lost is about disinheritence. How the Eden we once had has disappeared. There's a fire. Aunt cordelia, I think our farm is disappearing. What about our hay? Move Zoe. Dad?! Never seen anything like it son. Spectacular. We're losing our hay, Quebec bill. What's gone is gone ratty. Leave it to me. Why are we going to see frog lamundy dad? He's not gonna help us. No wild bill, he'd do anything for me. Frog lamundy's so generous, he'd give away his ass and shit through his ribs. Need one or two loads of your good Canadian alfalfa, frog. Just enough to carry us through. I ain't got a load to sell. Good or bad. Your barn is full of hay. Why do they call him wild bill? You don't look wild to me. You just ain't seen him frog. Not like I have. You sure this fella's your old man, wild bill? After thirty years gone... Running to hell and back. Who knows what he is? Nobody's got hay, Quebec bill. Not at the end of a long winter like this. Not for some freak fireman either. Why don't you just shoot them worthless critters? At least we won't lose a fortune making maple sugar this year. That's one worry I and wild bill don't have. Yeah, those maple trees you sold me... Still had spouts. Nothing chews up a saw blade like an old sugar spout. Cost me pretty money. Ignore what frog or anyone else says. You're a bonhomme, son. Did you find any hay? We didn't. But we did run out of gas. What a travesty. Rat will figure out a way to feed the animals. Potatoes? It's the one thing we ain't run out of certainly. Now what about that truck ratty? Woah everyone, look. Look at that rubberneck son of a bitch. Ain't that a sight? You're back. Who's back? C'mon. Giddyup. Gidduyup. What did you see out there? Talking to that owl. There will be a death soon, William. And I hope it will be mine. But what would you do then? I won't sleep alone. I know that. I can not endure much more of your father's lunacy. You boys interested in buying a fast car? We're interested in rentin' it. With a driver. Henry coville, gents. We know. Origene lachance. This is my brother, Andre. Bonjour. Bonjour. It's Henry. There's a big load of whiskey waiting over the line, Mr. coville. Twenty cases of it. And we'll pay $1,000 flat rate. On delivery. It's a beautiful day. Them men talkin' with uncle Henry... They look like FBI. G men, eh? You can always tell a g man, wild bill. But you don't want to tell them too much. Let's go tell that one to Henry. He loves a good joke. You think the g men are on to him? Not hardly. Henry learned everything he knows from me. They'll never catch him. He's too well trained. You think you'll ever get back in the business, dad? I'd like to see that. Look at that sky, wild bill. You damn bootleggers will do business with anyone. Don't know enough not to. Afternoon sheriff I heard there was a meeting back there. Who are you scheming with now? Calvin coolidge. Come up lookin' for some decent Canadian whiskey. The trouble with you fancy-ass Indians, over the hill outlaws, you don't know how to show proper respect to a white man. Find any hay? No. Uncle Henry, there's no hay anywhere. You know I'd help you out if 1 could, eh bill? I just got everything tied up in white lightning. Who's the men in the city hats? Lechance. Contract job. Thousand dollars hard cash. But there's something they ain't sayin'. You good at figuring. First thing you do- I already done it. I think I'll wait this one out. Well don't turn nothin" down 'til you check with me. Don't stop on my account. Yes, ma'am. Come quick. What is it? It's your bull. He's-he's choking. Cough, damnit. Come on hercu, cough. Butcher him. It's the only way for the fast money we need, evangee. No. We'll auction off part of the herd. Frog lamundy will sell us enough hay for two good milkers. He won't. I couldn't sell a living thing off this farm, and you know it. You promised you'd never run whiskey again. I know that. Quebec bill bonhomme. Let's start with the money. Tell your sister how much cash we'd get just from bringing a few cases of whiskey back from that barn up in maycoch. Tell her, hen. Well, we'd get plenty. For hay and then some. I'd be lying bill if I didn't say I'd love to take another run with ya, but it's... It's damn risky. You know, I ain't convinced it can work. I'm not convinced you won't resume youre drinking. You told me no more crazy stunts. I won't tell no one what to do, but we got potatas to last until next week. Unless more critters choke to death, then it might go around a bit longer. Not much. No easy choice, sister. You willin' to put me in charge? I wouldn't have it no other way. Wild bill will keep an eye on me, evangee. Wild bill? What about leaving wild bill right here? Where he belongs. I gotta take him with me. Little scouting mission's good practice for a boy his age. No thank you. Wild bill stays. Crazy bugger. We're back in business, Henry. I don't s'pose there's anything I can say to convince you to let wild bill go on this scouting trip? Do you forget how awful it was the last time you ran whiskey? I guess I do. Always determine what your father in a situation, then do exactly the opposite. Why are you telling me this now? Because I've slept on it. And in spite of myself, I've changed my mind. You should go with your father. There's no good for your mother to treat you like a prize fish. Can you convince her? I'll see that it's done. You look like your grandfather. And my father, William. He ran away over whiskey too. Wait, what do you mean? He's burried over back by mom's garden. Put the stone there myself he ain't under it. He disappeared, William. My grandfather, Rene, also. They died, isn't that what you mean? I loved a man once, William. A fine, brave soldier whom I killed on the common before I ever saw his face. Pardon? Perhaps, at last you'll learn your birthrite. William. Disappearances and extinctions are matters of human perception. Illusion and reality are interchangeable. Cordelia? Did you ever notice there's something a bit odd about everyone on dad's side of the family? Cordelia wants you to read. I insist on it. If you have difficulty with any lines, consult your uncle Henry. Cordelia? Your father's family is a bit unusual, William. But without cordelia you'd be a boy without a past. Only she could convince me to let you go. Here hath dawned another blue day, wild bill. It's one thing nobody can ever take away from ya. Did Henry ever find out what the men down at the common really wanted? Them lechance boys? Mmhmm. Henry still ain't exactly sure. He was in hopes the old master could straighten it out though. Have you straightened it out? Ain't even gonna try. As long as that whiskey's waitin' across the border, it don't matter. That's enough. Sweet Evangeline don't want Quebec bill filling his boy's head with whiskey talk on such a beautiful morning. By the Christ, look at that hawk. If 1 could do that, I'd eat raw fish m'self. This is a blasphemous venture, brother St. hillaire. Ahh my lord was a fisherman, brother Paul. Yes, but he wasn't a whiskey smuggler. A drop now and then might do you some good. I have a proclamation to make, brother Paul. What is it hillaire? You decided to quite this ungodly business? Certainly not. This ungodly business is going to put the monastary on a paying basis. Then what's your proclamation? I have to piss in the worst way. Surely not in the lake. Certainly not in the boat. If you're offended, just turn your head. I am offended. We shouldn't be out here in the first place, brother St. hillaire. Oh oh oh! Ugh. What's that? Hillaire, sit down, sit down. Cover up that whiskey. Hurry, hurry. Watch close, wild bill. Here he comes now. Who? Just watch. Oh, oh... trolling for trout. For the children at the county home. To hell with you, devil. I can't shoot. They're too close. Ow. Come on wild bill. Paddle hard. Push off Thank you, thank you, thank you. I hope you don't run into that madman further up the lake, my son. I hope we do. Good bye monks. Good bye hillarious. I got ya. Thank you brother. Welcome to Canada, wild bill. What's that devil doing in lake memphremagog anyways? I'd sure like to know. I never seen such a strange looking guy in all my days. You know my dad took me on a whiskey runnin' trip when I was about your age. Cordelia says your father disappeared. A lot of people do. Don't listen to cordelia. William Shakespeare Goodman was a whiskey runner. Fourth in a long line. Is that all he did? Run whiskey? I don't know. But without a reliable supply of liquor, kingdom county wouldn't be what it is today. And he just disappeared? And you changed your name? He's the one who changed the name. I just took it back. You and pa would've taken to one another, bill. The Wilder a boy was, the higher pa prized him. He prized me highly. Would've you too. Listen. That's Henry. You sure? I'd know that engine anywhere. Why does rat have the hornen? He'll spoil the whole trip. You ever see the man weap lettuce? He's an excaped convict. Rat earns his keep, son. Henry. Ratty. Wild bill. Uncle Henry. How was your trip up the lake? Uneventful. Wild bill told me stories all day to pass the time. How was the drive up? Heathenish fast. I'm having second thoughts about this whole operation. Tell him what you told me after we crossed over the line. What's the matter hen? Don't you think that I and wild bill can get that whiskey back across for ya? Bill, I'm sure you can... Hustle that whiskey up the lake with the women's temperance league patrollin' it. And sell 'em a case in the bargain. But go ahead, don't let me sidetrack you. I'll tell you, if Henry won't. Hear it is. We transport twenty cases and them two frenchman say they'll pay us a thousand dollars. For us that's fine. But that comes to fifty dollars a case. Where does that leave them? That's easy. What will a case of good Canadian whiskey cost in the country these days? A hundred dollars hard cash. Then their profit's fifty dollars a case, ratty. Well trouble is they'd have to pay fifty dollars a case for it in the first place. Boys, they've asked us to hull hijacked whiskey. I know that from the start. I won't be a party to common thievery. Not if them spirits don't rightfully belong to them frenchmen. Them spirits rightfully belong to the seagram's family in Montreal. But if you want to wait here in the dark woods, that's fine with me. I'm comin... I'm springing. You want a sasparilla, Billy? I'll take a coffee, Henry. But I'm buying wild bill a double shot of good Canadian whiskey. I'll have a sasparilla. Slice of lemon? What's the matter ratty? Can't get a beer like that down in whiskey's Jack's kitchen. If you must know, lord Jesus came to me in the night. And said I weren't to drink no beer in Canada. Well rat I've got glad tidin's for ya. Cuz about five A.M. I was sittin' in the kitchen loading buckshot into my shoes. And the lord appeared to me. What are you up to now, Quebec bill? Says he in a stern voice. I'm loadin' buckshot, lord. In case we run into any hijackin' sons of bitches out on the lake. Very good, my son, he says. I ain't telling you what to do, but I'd advise a double load. You never know what you might run into out there. Then he says one more thing. Earlier tonight I warned muskrat kenneson against him imbibing a beer up in Canada on account of it causing him discomfort and embarrassing winds. But I neglected to tell brother muskrat that he should feel free to have all the hard stuff he wanted. Would you deliver the message for me when he wakes up? Fetch me a triple shot. Of straight gin. I know some of the fella's in here. We won't have any trouble findin' out what we want to out. What do we want to find out? Whatever we can. You're drink, Mr. I thought he wanted to get some information. Nah he's getting... Go see what your father's doin... Alright, in-in a minute. My drinkin' days are over. I'm tryin' to find out where the lechance's might have hid a stash of whiskey... Bootlegger? Cattleman. From kingdom county. Looking for my lost earth. I can find anything. Lost half a lung over across in the great war. Can you find that? Drinks sir, provokes three things? Nose painting, sleep, and urine. Letchery it provokes. And unprovokes. That is from the- the Scottish play. Never again except even a drop of whiskey from your father, young sir. We don't need anymore disappearances in our family. Well, they must have gone somewhere. Where did they go? Anywhere. Nowhere. I don't care if you have but one lung, Henry coville. You have a great big heart and that's what counts. Henry, we gotta go. Rats in the back seat. Don't say nothin... Mr. man. That was one lively lookin' critter you was kissin'. What'd you find out? Plenty. And it keeps gettin' more interesting. It appears there was two rival games of hijackers up here. One of them was a family of five brothers named lechance. Lechance. That's our boys. Up until this fall, they had a monopoly on on all the local whiskey. Then carcajou showed up. Carcajou? Move over. Fine. Who's carcajou? It's Indian for Wolverine. Crazy man with a big gang of fellas. I ain't goin' there and neither are you. What do you even know of him? What do I know, I don't like. Carcajou hijacked lechance's whiskey in broad daylight. Just pulled up alongside their truck dressed like a policeman. Tossed in a lighted stick of dynamite, poof. I don't need to hear no more. This run's off. This ain't arun. It's a scouting expedition. So shut off your engine and hear the rest. I'll keep it runnin... Talk fast. Well he killed all but two of them. Now ain't ya convinced that this is the run for us? We got clear directions to carcajou's hideout. Good Christ, bill. We're going home right, Henry. We're goin' home with a thousand dollars worth of whiskey. Billy, you convince him. I ain't lettin' ya go. And I could never face my sister if I did. Be there a man in kingdom county who can tell Quebec bill bonhomme what he can and cannot do? No. Then I'm no man. Because I'll tell ya no. And I mean it. Sit tight bill. A dreadful man handling is about to take place. Look, just stop! You're both being foolish. I hate to do this Henry. I know you do bill. That booger's gone. Get in. Ahh, with the vomiting too. Henry ain't gonna like this. They ain't expecting us. Who's they? You'll see. Shh. This way. What? Dad. Carcajou. The two with the buick that hired Henry be the last two lechance boys. It all fits. Right down to the cases of the whiskey. Dad, let me see your jaw. Won't your mother be surprised when she sees how fast we done this? Escuse me, ratty. There, Henry won't even notice. What's going on? Carcajou must have let it slip out that he was keeping the shots of whiskey up here. They suspicioned that they was being set up. So they set up uncle Henry? To steal the whiskey for them? Right, bill. That's what let's us off the hook. So we're not gonna pick up the whiskey after all? Course we are. We just ain't gonna deliver it to them lechance fellas. This run's gonna be clear profit. By this time tomorrow, we'll be back on the other side of the lake with two thousand dollars worth of whiskey. Two thousand? You said one thousand before. That was before. This is after. But the whiskey ain't ours. Not yet it ain't. Dad, what are we doing? I'm not quite sure anymore. I'll be damned if wild bill isn't starting to sound like his uncle Henry. You need some sleep. C'mon. Dad. You never said anything about stealing. Well I ain't backing out son. And neither is ratty. We need this money in the worst way. This is about more than money. I hope so. It always is. I'm gonna go watch them fellas play cards. You can tell quite a bit about a man by the way he handles his cards. Be careful. I ain't never nothing else. Mornin' Henry. Glad you decided to join us. I got some good news. Whose vehicle would this be? It's yours hen. We was breakin' it in for ya. Uncle Henry, look at it this way. You broke dad's jaw, and he broke white lightning. So, now you're even. Did I do that? They're all sound asleep, hen. The way they was in there playing cards all night, they won't be up 'til noon. Even later. We're gonna split two thousand dollars worth a whiskey. And you're gonna get a new back up for white lightnin... Of course I am. Billy, you're comin' with me. I promised your mother. I promised her too, uncle Henry... That I'd look after dad. Nah, go ahead wild bill. Henry's right. But I forgot to tell you one thing, hen. No guards. No guards? We walk straight up to that whiskey. Could have taken six to ten cases right then and there. We was just waitin' for you. You don't know it's a set up? You're out of practice bill. It ain't like the old days. It's close enough. If you and Billy just give us a push, I and ratty'll return white lightnin' later this afternoon. We'll fill you in on all the details. I'll do this. Because I can't go back to vangee without you and wild bill. And I couldn't stand myself if 1 wasn't there to help you get outta what you're about to get inta. You're a good man, Henry. Wake up, ratty. Can you disable a packard? Quick? And quiet? This don't look like our bull yard. Watch what the hell yer doin... I told ya, hen. Want these on top? Yeah, but them right up here. Hurry, bill. Bring it over to this side. Shag ass boys. Henry! C'mon, grab it. Let's go. Ok bill, drive. Wait! Wait, damnit! Get in here, rat. Get in. What the hell are they doin? Get your cars. You'll pay for that whiskey. You've got a fine car here Henry. Well broke in, too. Hang on boys. No guards, he says. Jesus, Mary, and joesph. Wait 'til Evangeline here's about this. Yes, wait 'til she does. Just look at her boys. How's Henry and me gonna get home? I'd say canoe. Same as I and wild bill. Looks like she was struck by lightning alright. Don't it, though? We're damn lucky to be alive. And this lucks' gonna hold for us, hen. Just wait. Maybe this is just a dream. I'll wake up... And white lightning will be down at the hotel lot all shiney and new. But I doubt it. Henry, you're the best brother in law a man ever had. Look, we still got twelve full cases. That's more than enough cash after buying a little hay towards a new Cadillac, hen. I don't want a new Cadillac. I want white lightnin... And I aim to get her back on the road. And w'll do it too, hen. You and bill and me. No we won't. I will. Uncle hen? I'm sorry about white lightning. Dad is too. I know we can fix her up. Billy, you never have to make excuses for your father. Fresh caught rainbow trout, ratty. Could be a long night out there. It's tasty. I don't eat nothing that don't walk on four legs like a man. I wish I had a sup of something. Have a sup of coffee, or you'll be walking on all four legs yourself. If you help us load the canoe, don't be shitting yourself whiles we're rolling around the breakers, I'll give you a case of that whiskey. I'd rather have a sup now. I'd be sure of getting' it. You drive a hard bargain. I don't bargain. One sup. That's fair enough. Ohh. Ahh. Trouble with you is you have no faith in the holy ghost. I knew you'd get it runnin... She just needed a rest. That used to be an eight thousand dollar automobile. Not going to tell you how many whiskey runs in my old Ford it took to buy it. Or how many more she still got in her. Seems to be goin' pretty good. She might get me to the common. She might not. That water's dangerous. You outta move deep into the woods and stay put, and I'll try to get white lightning into town. Come back with a fast car. Get us and the whiskey across the border. Go ahead Henry. But we can't wait. We gotta go now. Sufficient run for the day ls evil thereof, bill. Don't go looking for no more. Just stay put. Let 'em pass. The monastary's just across the lake. Now you're talking horse sense. We'll get brother hillarious to stash our whiskey for us. Rat, can you ride with Henry? And leave my case of whiskey with you? Son. Rat kinneson only thinks of himself. Ah, rat's a good enough fella. When you get to know him the way I do, he's the best. You think everybody's a good fella. You probably think carcajou's a good fella. You're getting Wilder every day, son. Do you really want to go up against carcajou and his men? It's gonna get ugly out there if he catches up to us. He won't get the chance. We're just making a quick trip to the monastary. It's your plan, bill. I'll ride back with uncle Henry. Alright. It's him. It ain't him. It's one of his men, that's for sure. Christ, he smelled us. Us or the whiskey. Dad. We've gotta get moving. We'll do better at night. Take it slow. I don't know about this. Seasickness runs in my family. Fine. Stay here and greet general Grant for us. I gotta feeling he'll be coming along here sooner or later. Snakes, man. If I drown, you'll have to run the farm again. Remember that. I think it's the radiator, Billy. There's nothing for it but some lake water. I'll stay here. I don't know about that. It's best all around. I'll stay with the car. Under the buffalo road. Alright then. Well, you lay low and hang tight. You sure you gonna be alright? Hail to thee, baron bonhomme. Cordelia help me. Henry's not back yet. I've gotta find him. You can't. That doesn't mean you shouldn't try. All human endeavor is illusory, though not necessarily futile. If you follow this road in either direction, you'll spend the night in a most unpleasant shape. Which way should I go? Christ, boy. You sir, surrender. Climb outta there. No tricks. This is ain't worth it, Quebec bill. The whole damn farm ain't worth it. You're right, ratty. It ain't. The only thing that's worth staying out here is stopping that son of a bitch carcajou. You trying to get us killed and you're doing a pretty good job at it. Let me out of here! Henry. Lechance? I ain't lechance. Let him go. Hand me the gun. Throw it down or you'll drag your buddy out of here like a dead deer. Throw me the bag. Bonhomme. That's your name? I don't want to shoot you. All I want is my whiskey. Show it to me. Or you go to hell. Good. Bag yourself a Wolverine, ratty. Bon soir. How'd you get a hold of 'em? He drowned and he weren't that small. Let them fellas go. Where is he? Right here. Quebec bill. Dad. I killed one of carcajou's men. Good. Ratty, bring that whiskey aboard. Yes sir. And good job. Now this ain't a bad boat. You alright? Course I am. There goes our whiskey. I'm going in for it. Booma ooma looma pooma. Ratty. Pull up the rope when I give the single. Bill, you're losing your grip. The man stole the whiskey fair and square. He's got a right to salvage it. Here's a blanket. First case up is mine. Thanks. Thank you. Ah, don't thank me. Thank your father. Dad. Carcajou knew your name. Could be he'd heard of me. I still can't believe I killed a man. You had a decision to make. Other than myself I've never met a person who thinks faster than you. I had no choice, dad. You're a good whiskey runner, son. I know that, and I'm proud of you. Let's run up and find hilarious. I promised Henry. Go 'head. I'll walk. C'mon son. I'll walk. Henry, wait. Beware young man. Hell is empty. All the demons are here. Aunt cordelia? I saw your son last night. He resembled my grandfather and your father. Rely on his being troublesome. Carcajou is dead cordelia. A man can die but once, William. He's dead. Shhh. I'll tell you a secret. Carcajou's cursed. He doesn't know who he is. Part skunk, part wolf. I know how to break his curse. Listen carefully. No. Don't tell me anymore of your secrets. I don't-just don't tell me another word. Come home William. The cows haven't eaten in three days. I'm not leaving dad. He saved our lives our there. Things have gone well then. Failure of any kind inspires your father's finest moments. Remain here and you'll end up wearing him like a jacket. I'm staying. You're wife will be from Quebec. Saint hillaire. Brother Paul. Brothers. We've been lost but now we're found. You have prevailed over behazelbub. Here hilarious. More stimulant for the benedictine. I think brother St. hillaire has had ample stimulant. Like hell he has. Oh. Advise him to be careful with that whiskey. Ahh. You gotta nice place here, hen. But it might not be the best spot to stash our whiskey. I'd say we ain't got much choice. I have a better plan. I'll make it fast. Bill, don't. You're overreaching yourself. I seen it before during the war. They start in and get theirselves killed. Sometimes the other fella get himself killed too just tryin' to keep it all from happenin... What other fella? Would that be you? We leave the whiskey here. If we leave it here, we'll never see it again. There will be nothing left to save the farm. Bill, you don't listen too good but hear this. I've had all a man can stand. Brother hillarious. Yes. I've got a little proposal I'd like to discuss with you, your holiness. In private. Of course. Anything at all. You couldn't bind him in his sleep if ever slept that is. Still got four milk cans full of whiskey boys. Excuse me captain. I and these other clergymens was wondering if we could ride along down to- no, no riders. Company policy. Watch out for the steam. Who runs the company captain? Who runs the company? Goodness, priest. I don't know who runs the company. The company. They do. The company runs the company. The company run your engine for you too? I run my engine. Good. Then you won't mind a young brother and I having a look, would you? Don't spill that whiskey. Company doesn't say nothing about not drinking whiskey, does it? No, not so long as I don't drink at the throttle. Thanks father. You've got a fine engine here. Too bad you can't decide who can ride your own train, though. Yeah. What the company don't know, won't hurt 'em. Tell you friends to get in the milk car. Oh yeah. This must be a good job. Yeah, used to be before they started hiring frenchman on the section gang. Shiftless lot, eh? Babbling, snarky. Slaughtering the king's english. Talking jobs away from the white men. Just last night I got right up on my hind legs about it. You should have heard the boys holler and stomp. You gonna lose your voice. Better have a short one. Oh short one, huh? Wouldn't hurt. There. See what I mean? Not one of them doing a damn thing. Hey. You've gotta stay on their good side otherwise you never know, you know. But you do know how to run ol' 22 don't ya? That must be the throttle. Yeah. You think you can teach a young boy how to drive her? I don't see why not, as long as he have no French in him. Here, step up here son. Go 'head brother. Feel her throb? That's seventy tons of steel. I don't know... I'd like to try it myself. I don't see why not, pastor. If that ain't a caution. I wish the boys at the legion could see this. Caution's my middle name, captain. Have another sup. The old 22 is in good hands. How fast can she go? Oh about 80, on a downgrade. Not over this Ridge though. There's a hairpin curve at the bottom. Hell, them rocks do rush by. What's in the boxcar, captain? Newsprint? No. Hay. Ontario. Alfalfa. Alfalfa hay he says, brother William. Here. I'm gonna take over now. Who's that dark, curly haired fella? There's a little dark French fella hangin' on to you ladder, captain. Hold on to those controls. I'll be right back. Ahh! Bon voyage. Huh, bill. We're the proud new owners of a carload of alfalfa. What are you doing, dad? We can't hijack a train. We're gonna get in a lot of trouble. I wonder where the brakes are. Oh no. That's ok, I think I've found them. A mountie just jumped on the train. I saw 'em. He jumped in the boxcar. See if you can find the brakes. I'll find the mountie. Where is the wee man, lad? Where did he go? Get back. You want this. Take it. Me face is not... So tell me where he is. Drop the gun. It's a great way down. Jump. Ahh. This'll be one dandy of a trainwreck, bill. What I'd call spectacular. Wish old comptain was here for it. Just listen. I'm listening. What the hell happened to old 22? A seventy ton train don't just vanish. Quebec bill. Up here. Jesus. Better get him down. Ratty's probably getting pretty vexed up there. Don't move. Oh my neck hurts. Christ. Jesus. Here catch. No! Just let go. Just drop the whiskey and jump. Quebec bill. Dad. Dad! Hold on. I don't like trees. Dad, dad! Dad, where are you going? That train's gotta be off the track down here somewhere. I bet we could still save that alfalfa. No, we need to stay here now. You don't 'spose Henry's driving that son of a bitch? You're leg is bleeding bad. Sit down. It's just the wound bleeding itself out. They do that, you know. Ain't that sky the grandest sight you ever hope to see? I hope Evangeline's watchin' that. We've gotta stop this bleeding. Don't make no big thing out of this. It's just my leg's got a bullet hole in it. I don't know how he did it, with that pipe all stuck through him. What's that buzzin'? Help! Over here! Help! Help! Them's the border patrol. We better get movin... Ain't this the most spectacular trip you ever imagined? Ain't it? Yes it is. Henry's right though. Them mounties are going to be all over us before we know it. I hope so. What? You don't want to be a part of that. If they get up to us, we're giving up on the spot. And you're going to a doctor. No stunts. You have to promise. As long as you promise to bust me out of jail? The best way is to go straight home, through those trees. They'll never find us in there. What about Henry and rat? The mounties will take care of them. They ain't done nothing wrong. Just a couple of hobos who hopped the wrong freight train. Damnit dad. Come on. We can't take any chances. Who the hell's in that? Just when I thought we was in the clear. Come on, bill. Damn. That man's indestructable. Let me down before we both break our necks. Just get over here. Get the hatchet and the rope. Now cut off two poles about twelve foot long. Trim off the branches. You alright? The best. Don't bust a gut son. We're doin' fine. Giddyup wild bill. Head due south. Ahh. Don't worry. It's good to get some blood running into my head. Some of it is running down your leg. We've got to fix the bandages. Wait a minute, wild bill. Look at that trout. Go cut it free with your hatchet. That's a fate I wouldn't wish on man or fish. He's dead. No he ain't. They'll live for weeks froze up like that. Cut him free, bill. That's it. Ain't he pretty? Maybe I'll take him home. It'll be a fine thing to show Evangeline. I'm glad we'll have something to show her. Dad wake up. Youre leg will freeze. Does it hurt? Uhh. I don't know when it's ever felt so good. If I had a pair of tongs... I'd reach in there and pull out that slug. Make it feel even better. You mean the bullet's still in there? Get your knife. Dig in there. Can you see it? Uh no. Go a little deeper. You ain't got into the meat yet. Let it go. It's better. Bill, just a minute. Here. Throw him back in the water. I told you he'd come too. A fish refuses to give up. I know'd we could bring him back to life. Maybe he'll Grant us three wishes. But I doubt it. What do we need to wish for? We still together, ain't we? Henry and I gotta go back into the business, wild bill. We'll get ratty drunk enough to repair white lightnin" and then we'll run whiskey across that border in grand style. Nobody'll stop us. You better move your leg back from the fire. It'll get too hot. You know what I and you and sweet Evangeline are gonna do when I start making money on the whiskey runs? I been thinkin' about it all day. We're gonna take a trip. Another trip? Yes. And not no little piss ant canoe trip like this one either. We're gonna outfit a plane. Fly up to Montana and Idaho. Show you where I used to work the tall timber and the great cattle ranches. I bare fisted lumberjacks like they was nothing. Why did you come back to the kingdom, dad? Same reason I left. To find my father, wild bill. Ya think he would've come back. I followed every clue for thirty years. Nothing else mattered to me. I quit lookin" when I found your ma. But that's a different story. Jeez. Oww. Dad, wake up. Ah Jesus. Did I pass out? You fell asleep and burnt your leg. Here, drink this. I don't need... I'm afraid you do. Here, just... I promised Evangeline. Dad, dad? I look for ya thirty years you old son of a bitch. And now I find you in El Paso. I outta put the boots to ya for running off on me like that. What is it you run across this border? Listen. Dad, we have to get you to a doctor. Yes, we'll get to a doctor. And the old drunk will give me a christly enema. No thanks, bill. We'll wait here 'til dawn. Christ. Sound like a panther. Ain't no more panthers around here. That's him isn't it? Leave fast as you ever run in your life. Don't stop 'til your home. No, you are coming with me. I ain't asking ya, son. I'm tellin' ya. Come on. Help me. Come on. Henry. Where's dad? Listen carefully, William. They're calling me. You're father's calling. My father's calling. Where are they? I must join them. Youre education has been provided for. You will leave here for a time, and then return as your father did. The house will be waiting for you. Even though it is disappearing, kingdom county is still a place of wonders. I don't need to tell you to read your Shakespeare daily. In matters of this world, consult your uncle Henry, not your mother. Her attachment to life was through your father. Remember, you can not possess land any more than you can possess another person. We dispossess ourselves through possessions. Never regard the ordinary without perceiving in it the extraordinary. Mine and yours. Mine, not yours. Earth endures. Tell me. Heathens. Hell fire. Bonhomme. You're a dead man. Bonjour, petite bonhomme. Come and get me. Get up. You're in the hands of an angry god. William Shakespeare Goodman. William Goodman. My grandfather. William. Dad?
