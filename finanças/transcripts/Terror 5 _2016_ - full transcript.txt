All this happened, more or less. The rumors that led to the outburst continue despite curfew. There is a strange mood surrounding the Congress. 3 years of delay that are now concluding upon impeachment against Dr. Palacios... identified as the main person responsible for the tragedy at Camargo street where 15 people died in the collapse of a construction site. After many efforts in the political spectrum it was possible to investigate Palacios management with 3 of his alleged accomplices. Needless to say that society is on edge of their seats After many efforts in the political spectrum on this strange nights. It's important to stop creating differences, I will repeat it, to avoid misinterpretation. Nobody, neither me nor any of my staff denies this tragedy. This tragedy affected us all deeply. We have arrived to the cemetery "Rest in Peace" with the victim’s families from the tragedy on Camargo street. Relatives are now approaching from the bus that brought us. We are accompanying them. At this point they will approach the graves of their relatives to hear the sentence from there. We are accompanying them respectfully. You came earlier. Yes. I don't have my cell anymore. Did you lose it? Yes. Kinda. What are you doing? Come with me. Sorry, but I don't get it. Did we come to steal tomorrow’s chemistry exam? No, Juan. I studied for it all week. Didn't you say you wanted to come to school at night? -Me? -Yes. And you'd like to come with me. You told me about your fantasies, Juan. We talked about desire... I told you I fulfilled some... I spoke about fear and desire. I told you to... Come with me. Trust in me. Thanks for accomplishing my desires... What else did I say? I don't remember. You told me that you're a virgin. And I told you that I'm not. We connected. Talked about music, films... ...you told me about Professor Guerrico. You were very angry. I'm starting to remember how I felt then... ... I could talk about everything with you. Exactly. I fall in love easily, you've been on my mind since then. You don't look your age. Shall we continue? Faster, Alderete, faster! That's Aristimuño, right? Exactly. That's Aristimuño... ...and he has a problem with Professor Alderete. It's his class where he feels humiliated. Aristimuño is new. He's spent two weeks with us. He used to have trouble with groups, and he still does. But now he's getting it all together. He's got us. This is insane. It's Professor Alderete running Cooper's test. Professor Alderete will run until he understands that everything in life has meaning... ...including his lies. This is a command, Juan. A command they imposed on us without even knowing. Faster, Alderete! You told me, you wanted something... ...desperately. If the desire is not strong enough, it won't go anywhere. "I know what you want" I said. We doubt what teacher Cuenca teaches us. Do you really think that the people who educate us, abide by what they teach? You can answer, if you want. Sorry, I don't know what to say. It's typical. Don't worry. They brag of verticality, but this is relative. It depends on the point of view. You may think you’re up, and, actually, never stop being down. What we discovered is that, as education is traumatic for students, as it must be for them. ...a thumb on the front legs. What are you doing here? You know you're not smart enough to pass! You know it well. -That was the reason, wasn't it? -Stop! Say it! You are all nuts! This is too much! You are losing control of... What are you looking for? I see everything stays the same. And now I'm looking at you. Take it. Your parents took yours, right? I'll confess I had already seen you, you're one of the cutest boys at school. I can't even think right now. Sometimes, that's the best. I also feel I can talk about anything with you. You could have told anyone about Guerrico, but you told me. What's up? Are you speechless? Are you afraid that I fulfill your desires? Maybe I'm your fairy who fulfills your fantasy, or your slave... Your teacher, or your pupil. 2 beers, quick. At the end we just study to try not to fail and repeat, when we should study to learn. -And you repeated. -I don't need you to remind me. Thanks to Professor Guerrico. Something brought you here, John. You didn't start feeling this way at the party. Do you know how many people don’t make it past the second door? What are you thinking? This is insane. Don't you think it's too much? -It doesn't seem real. -But it is. Is it too much? No! It's just once a week. I thought we came for a different reason. Did you think it would be your first time? No. Not at all. I bet there are condoms in your pockets. Yes or no? All you need is in there. If you feel something, but you’re not terrified, it's because, somewhere inside you, this is familiar. There's a place for you here, John. I remember every word you said at the party. What did I say? I want to leave my mark on him, so it won't ever disappear and he will remember me forever every time he sees it. Maybe what I said it wasn't true. Maybe I overreacted... It doesn't matter anymore. I'm going with you. And despite the harassment some of the media applies to me, my commitment is with life and justice. Pain speaks for me. I feel each for each of the victims Sometimes I find myself talking to them amid the night, so this is a battle of life over death. These were Alberto Palacios' words before entering Congress to hear the verdict. We're all waiting, the moment has arrived. Family members are in place where they will hear the sentence. Consequently, for the crimes of malpractice in the public service, institutional negligence and embezzlement, this court finds the accused: Nicolas Anibal Pernich: not guilty; Bertránd Lopez: not guilty; The remaining verdict concerns the Mayor Alberto Palacios. ...Alberto Palacios, BSc: not guilty. -Hi. -Hi, gorgeous. -You're good? -Yeah. Should we...? Are you in a hurry? You look great. What's up? Okay. Let's go. -Good evening. -Hi. Got a room? Yes. I have the "Roman trophy" for you. -Okay. -Okay. Perfect view 10/10. My command would be: Blink once, Marina is here; blink twice, it's Mariana; 3 blinks, in; turn to the right, we don't know each other. Perfect. From here, 10/10. So, does it work or no? Sure, dude, it does work but it's a mess. They talk about the new communication devices, but... ...I don't have a fucking clue. Read the manual. Keep on telling me about the investigation. Yes, I heard the big motel "La femme" is great. They say is cheap and good, it's really near. The "candy" is to go and ask for the Roman Trophy. I did some research, but this week it's taken. Did Dorothy confirm? I'll start believing in miracles. Hold on, I have a call. Nobody kisses better than me in all Liniers. Did you know that? -Come on! -Really! You don't believe me? I just saw a car rocking, but I guess they were fucking their brains out. Because it was moving as if there was an elephant inside. Cherry! Cherry! Cherry! What? He's talking! Calm down, dude. You better slow down. Roll one up, man. Roll one up, dude, it's all good. Go on. Well, I took my bike and rode to Primera Junta, to Rojas street, where there's a mall... That guy makes me sick, can't we turn the TV off? Hey, Cherry! Pour me some beer. Go on. The fact is in that mall there's a shop... ..which rents videos. But the real customers, like me... ...let's say we have access to weirder things. -Hello. -Weirder things? Yes. Different kinds of movies, obscure movies, porn... Sick stuff. Movies that don't exist... ... about things that nobody should do. It's not that much. Shut up, Cherry! Can you be more specific? PBC movies. Do you know them? Pornographic Bizarre Combinations. Like two girls and a guy? What are you laughing at, Cherry? Seriously, what are you laughing at, bitch? You told me you did it with a whore, and that's was all. He told me right in the hallway. You told me you dreamt of somebody playing with your balls... Grabbing them with your fingers. This three little fingers. Like cupping a tea bag you said. Don't you? I'm fucking with you dude! Don't you realize? Pour me some beer. Dude, we're here, having a good time. Wait, wait! Stop! Look at that smile... You're super happy! Not that much. You know what I did? I thought of Fabio, the one from HR, who you tease, by the way. Maybe you are kinda gay. Maybe you're a dick. You're such an asshole! Don't get pissed! It's not such a big deal! What? Remember... ...the time you asked me not to wear panties? It's nice when you say "panties". I really like it. Which night? I don't remember. We went downtown, and... ...and we went to that motel that had... ...it had a hammock hanging from the ceiling. It was great. You did magic that night, and never did it again. Let's do it. Let's do those magic tricks. At first we didn't know how to place ourselves, but... ...you took me up there and it was like... ...something about the angles... ...we reached an amazing angle. It was incredible. You don't remember? Really? The night we had Chinese food. Oh, no. Sorry. I'm sorry. Move! Really are you getting this mad? You're such an asshole! It's not like we were dating, you know? What? Who was that? Mariana, she says she's late. You did a long blink, that means trouble. That means trouble? Then I'm super confused. Listen... ...so how does it go? I've been thinking. Say it. I thought of two plans but can't choose which one. On one hand there's the shower game, but it’s complicated since you have to be naked. Mhmm. Preparation time? 45 minutes. And the other one? Hector and Osvaldo, the parallel universe and 2 strangers. 2 female strangers? Yes. It's a version of the game Hector and Osvaldo and the parallel universe. Yes, bro, but I don't know anyone who succeeded. I know for a fact that the Torres Brothers nailed it. We can open with the intro of Hector and Osvaldo... ... then we make the transition to the shower game. "Sell me the pen", you are her, I am us. It's simple, the shower game is a perfect game in which the woman is the first to say no, and the man to say yes. The key lies in the transition or how you get through the process of explanation. For instance: In the shower game a brush is not allowed, yet it's neither forbidden. That's a good one, dude! We must all end up together in the shower. If you get to sell that, we get loaded! They key is they must not know each other. Pau, are you there? Hey, Pau. There's someone back there. Is it one of them? Is it Mariana? It seems to be Dorothy. Listen, I'll call you back in a minute. How you doin', friendo? -Drop by whenever you want! -Come on, dude! It's not like we were committing a crime! Look. I've got this Paraguayan piece, the best in town. Next week, $200 more. -That's a lot! -Blame it on the dollar. If it were domestic industry... Mhmm. What's up, Dorothy? What's up? The ritual, dude! Give me one, I'll roll it in 5. -No! I don't have 5 minutes. -5 seconds! Take it. But did you actually see those films? I saw one, once. Sure. "Anal Odyssey". His favorite one. Did you see "Sexual Draw", for example? Maybe I did, maybe I didn't. The important thing is that... ...within the infinite combinations of PBC, there's a sub genre, which nobody speaks about, yet it exists. It's best to believe those movies don't exist. Snuff films, where people are killed on camera... But it's bullshit. Every one I saw was bullshit. -It's not. -It is too. It's not bullshit. Cesar said he's coming a bit late. -Why? -He has things to do at school. I didn't know he worked the night shift. -He is not. -Then? But the important thing is... ..I got a real snuff film. A real true snuff for a real true client? You are a real smart ass today! You know I thought of giving you this... ...you can put it on your boyfriend and pretend it's me. Why don't you give it to him so he can come with us, since he has no... But I like his custom! Are you disguised as a Cherry? No, I did not come in costume because you didn't tell me. Maybe we don't want you to come. What is it for? It’s about what its used for... but what using it represents. But when I make love I like to see the other person's face. "TTM"? "Total terror in the motel" is the name of the film. They really thought hard about the title! It's a snuff movie, babe, what do you expect to be called, "Son of the bride"? What? I never saw a porn film. It's not porn, girls. Okay, a snuff film. Hey, Cherry! Pour some beer! -Come on, you pour it. -What? I don't want to pour anymore. Be useful, dude. Pour the girls some beer. Really, dude. Enough. -What? -Really, dude. Stop it. Don't be such a Cherry, dude. Pour the beer. Can you pour the fucking beer? They are asking you nice! Pour. Do it! Do it, Cherry. That's it! Good! Thanks, Cherry. See how easy it was? -Have you got friends, Cherry? -Was it because of the whore? neither me nor any of my staff denies this tragedy... This tragedy affected us all deeply. ... but this traged... Reception. Hi. Have you got any cheap champagne? Uh... No, I don't. You don't have champagne or anything cheap? None of either, but I can get you some cider and cover it with a rag. And is it cheap? Cheapish Okay, bring it. -Bye. -Bye. Play some music. Come on! Play some music! I can't see. Move! Come on, you can't fool me, I'm feeling you! Son of a bitch! Hi! Listen, your boyfriend asked me for champagne, I'm a bit behind. I'll be up 5. Great. What did they say? I'll blow your mind. -That's what they say? -Uh-huh. Ow! -What's wrong? -Stop. -Relax! -Stop! I mean it! Leave! I saw someone from behind the mirror. Come here. -Behind the mirror? -Really. Look! I'm telling you, come, look! -What do you want me to do? -Approach it! Fucking annoying! Nothing at all. -It's a mirror. -I swear I saw somebody. I think you want revenge. I swear I saw somebody. I thought I saw something. It's all black. You're playing me, right? Well, that's it, right? Are we done, pal? -Bye dude! -See you! Here I am. Hey! Needless to say that the whole society is on edge Oh, Lucio! Lucio? Hey... Fuck you, Dorothy. The film you're about to see wasn't made by professional actors. What follows is the hardest and absolute truth. Welcome to Mr.X' last film! What's happening? What are you doing? Not me, please! Stop, stop! No! Total terror in the motel! Great fun! No! No! I can't watch it anymore. But it's bullshit! It's clearly a production, didn't you see "Paranormal Activity"? Don't turn it off. Mr. X...they fucked me up. So, Cherry? What do you say, real or fake? No... You bought it, Cherry. ...if I were kidding I'd call you Cherry. Wouldn't I... Cherry? I'm fucking with you, dude! Don't you want to fuck today? Don't you? Just follow my lead, dude. "Today I dip the wick" "Today I dip the wick", say it, dude. -"Today I dip the wick". -That's it! Get her down off the pedestal, don't idealize her! She's just a dick sucking bitch, she's ready, dude! You have to... listen to me, you have to... look at her as if you were undressing her. You see? You must imagine you undress and fuck her hard. Got it? Dude, look at me. I know I cross the line, that's who I am. I'm the same with my mom, my sister, my granny, it's not personal. I know I cross the line, don't I? Don't I? -Yes, a bit. -I know I do. You know what? If you don't fuck her... I'll fuck her. And if I don't get to fuck her, I'll fuck you, dude. What do you think? That I never fucked a chubby slut like you? What an obese chub. You are so pretty... I'm fucking with you, dude! I'm joking! You're Cesar's cousin, dude. Cesar is my friend. That's it. Don't worry. Somebody is gonna "hung a honcho" on someone's ass tonight. Hello? Son of a bitch. Hi. Do you know what I like about you? What? That when you take me by the waist you lean on me firmly. I saw that in an old movie. What an educated guy, do you learn it all from movies? Almost. Then I hope you've seen some porn. Where are you? Behind you. Come on, where are you? "Come on", I'm almost there, I had a problem. Do I have to beat anybody up? I think so, it's really dark here. How far are you? Are you going to turn back every time I say I'm behind you? Just guessing. I'm couple of blocks away. I had to go somewhere first. We must not meet anyone by the street, they just announced a curfew. Listen, I'll call you back in a minute. Hello! It's been more than a minute! Well, I'm sorry. Where are you? How many times are you gonna ask? Tell me: what am I doing now? My friends say you're not much of a gentleman. Tell them there is not a gentler man. That's what turns me on the most, I'd like to see you having sex with others, anyway, if that'd happen some day, you are mine first, second and third, I don't want any rivalry... Are you sure? Yes, I've got skills you don't know about yet. Why don't you tell the driver to step on it? Because I'm not in a cab. I can't wait for you to take my clothes off with your teeth. How many tongues have you got? You don't trick me! Uh!... ...I'm really wet. Now I see you! Cold, cold...and I'm so hot! I'd like to receive you with my legs open. Have a sexual encounter with no words. You and I, one inside the other. And you open the door and my pants are down. I'm about there... Marina? Or Mariana. Open up! Open the fuck up! Open up, you mother fucker! I have the best story about your cousin. I shouldn't share it, but you deserve it. It's called: "They were 3 and they had a bag." There it was your cousin, 2 friends and they had a bag. So, the smartest of the 3, calls and asks for: a mixed combo or the 3 sexes menu. When the 3 sexes menu arrives, they were all so wasted, so fucking loaded... ...that their dicks were limp. Limp dick Cherry! So, on one hand you had the 3 sexes, on the other hand the 3 friends and in between them 3 dead dicks. No, no, no! And since they didn't want to waste the night, they all started choking the chicken anyways. And suddenly, an almost magical, miraculous moment takes place, and there's a romantic moment, where one of the girls recognizes... the guy who was his high school mate. So she tells him: So she tells him, she tell him: look where we met again, Roberta! No! And the other one answers: "The paths of life are amazing". Of course, because there was nothing left to do... they ended up having breakfast some place across the street, since it was 6 AM. Unbelievable! Unbelievable! This story left me really horny... How about spin the bottle? Right! Yeah! Perfect. The one spinning kisses for sure. First coincidence means kiss and touching is allowed. Let's do it. As if you did it on purpose, man. -What's with the face, you idiot! -I didn't make any face! Lose the cig. Asshole. What are you doing, dude! You're insane! What? Your face is all white. My turn. Ohhh! Cherry! Cherry! Cherry! Cherry! Cherry! Cherry! Cherry! Cherry! Cherry! Cherry! Go, Cherry! Go! Go! Now! Wait a minute! What are you doing with this, sir? This is weed. It's illegal to smoke this in public places. Your ID card, please. And, besides, this ID expired. Didn't you know that Mr.... ..Cherry? Mrs. Cherry! -Mrs. Cherry, is spectacular! -Mrs. Cherry! Bottoms up! Bottoms up! Cherry! Cherry! Go, Cherry! Go! Do it, daddy! Hey, dude! What are you doing? Fuck you, dude! Are you fucking the other asshole, bitch? What the fuck is wrong with you, asshole? What is wrong with you, sicko! If you are getting paranoid, you better not get high. You're the one seeing things on the other side of the mirror, stupid. This is over. Of course it's over. I'll go. Sure! Go get the champagne. Asshole! Hernán... don't! Cherry! Listen to me. Go jerk off a bit and go fuck yourself, dude! Take a look, ass. What's up, Cherry? Welcome to Mr. X' new film: Total terror in the motel Great fun! I have no news from Quiroz. Keep trying. Hello. I want to make it clear I never doubted justice. Will you ask for an official apology? No, I won't. I was harassed and tarnished. All I ask is for those who did it to commit... ... to the families of the victims. Keep it, burn it, Keep it, burn it, keep it, keep it, bur...no, keep it, burn it. Spectacular! The party is over there! But that's not a custom. We were fucking lost! That's not a custom. They are spectacular, dude! Look! They got all dirty! Fuck you, Cherry! I want to be clear that I never doubted justice. Will you request a formal apology? No, I won't. I was harassed and tarnished. All I ask is for those who did it to take the commitment... ... to the families of the victims. They are the ones... who want them to stop using their pain ... for their own personal gain. People is very unhappy with the verdicts. We must trust justice. Thanks. These were Alberto Palacios' words after hearing the verdict in the Congress. Palacios! Aquino... ...what are you doing here, what's going on? Everything! Wanna play hero now? Get the hell out, or I get you shot. Let's go. Mario. What do you want, Aquino? Is it money? More money? Do you think this will erase your past? You wanna play innocent with me now? Today I heard the screams. The screams I never screamed! Uh, Aquino... Don't talk to me about your personal tragedy... Father of pain Embrace chaos, Aquino! Do you think this is new? You think everyone is a cockroach! Yessssss! Rat! Look at them.... they are all dead. And you'll end just like them, maybe worse, like something that has no name. What do you want? Money? You rats are all the same. Money! Is it dough what you want? You are all the same... My name is Miguel Aquino, I'm Argentine, and I had a son who died many years ago. I lost my way! And I regret it! I'm behind myself! I didn't cry for him. I betrayed everything, I betrayed the universe! Here I am. Here I am! I'm yours! Come and take me! The film you're about to see wasn't made by professional actors. What follows is the hardest and absolute truth. Welcome to Mr.X' last film!
