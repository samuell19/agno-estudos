THE SKELETON OF MRS. MORALES GREAT FERTILIZER SOLD HERE 2.00 PER BAG I can't take it anymore, Father, my suffering is too great. One can forgive violence, insults but the cruelty.. He always finds a way to torture me, to hurt me, he's a monster. I think you are too harsh. He pretends he likes children, but he lies. He does that to humiliate me, to remind me that God didn't give me a child of my own. The other night he arrived drunk, he wanted to get me drunk.. To.. I can't believe it I had to scream so he'd leave me alone. He was furious and said some things that.. He looked like the devil I can't take it anymore, Father. This house, with this stink of rotten animal. He's happy when I'm sick, and his mockery.. He makes fun of my disability of my beliefs. Even that? Yes, Father. And he mocked you, too. What a husband you've got! Well, I can only tell you that dignity and resignation.. Is your cross to bear. Don't forget that suffering purifies.. And it's the best way to get close to God Since you've behaved, I've popsicles for each of you! Here, here, take it Here, Paloma, and Iguana. And you too Ner√ªn Thanks for the popsicles and here you go, to say thanks Wow, look at this, what a huge scorpion, thank you. I found it! But I caught it! - You re lying! - No, you're lying! Quiet, quiet! I'm assure you I caught the scorpion, important tasks such as this one, can only be done as a team. How is it going, Father Artemio? Nice of you to visit us. I heard Gloria was sick. Sick? This morning when I left she was strong as a rock. Don't be a cynic! Oh, well so, very busy? If you're ironic, let me tell you my job is a ministry.. And much more difficult than yours And who says otherwise? To save a sinner's soul must be way harder... than stuffing an iguana. Or to exhibit human remains for sale... that should be resting in peace To desecrate tombs is one of the...! Don't exaggerate Father I don't desecrate anything, I just fix them for the study of future doctors. You and the doctors! Well, I don't want to argue here. It's just that you don't like me, and every time you're constipated.. I'm not constipated, and your jokes are not funny! Instead of using your mouth for mocking others, you should use it to comfort your poor wife! We're done! Have a good day Are you sick? My head hurts and I have the chills. Maybe you have a fever. Don't touch me! Your hands must be dirty from gutting animals. Wash them and rub some alcohol. In a second. Please I beg you not to wear a hat in front of the saints. Yes, I'm sorry, I forgot. Do you want an aspirin? They're no good. How can you say that? They reduce the pain God gives pain, and only he can take it away. To take it away, he had men invent the aspirin! You know your irreverence offends me. Sir, your food is ready Food I love that word I'm coming! I'll be right back Wait, I'll get up, I don't want you to eat alone. Don't bother It's no bother. Come here help me put on my shoes. Not those give me my slippers. Meche. Why did you bring that? Since he sometimes likes to... I thought that.. Don't do it again. He already drinks enough without your help. If someone heard you.. I don't deny I like to drink once in a while, but I'd never get drunk. Wait. Wash your hands and rub some alcohol. Meche. You and I have to talk. Ma'am I.. Bring the alcohol from my bedroom. Yes, ma'am. Look at that steak! You're a gift! Here, put some on. Alcohol? So that everything tastes like it? I don't think so! It's been long since I had a steak so good. What's wrong now? Nothing, it's just that the smell of meat.. Please Gloria! Sorry but I don't understand how you can eat meat.. After dismembering rotten animals. It smells the same, and it looks the same.. I cannot even eat in peace! I'm not picky, but with the alcohol and your hurling.. What do you want me to do? You think I like eating only vegetables? But I cannot even look at the meat, it looks like the animals you stuff. It's not my fault you chose such a horrible career! The problem is you hate me, you can't stand me Outside you are happy, laughing, but when you see me, even your expression is different. When will God take me so that you.. Don't have to see me anymore? Are you done, sir? No, it's okay Sir, I'm leaving. You can't stand her either? She bugs you too? For a long time, but that's not why. Now.. she's jealous of you and me. And she's been telling stuff to people. Please stay, do it for me. If you leave me alone with her, I wouldn't know what to do Here, buddy, enjoy. I'm going over the Mendioleas'. Meche. Meche. She left to visit the mummies Now that we're alone, let's use the opportunity. Meche, make me a steak this big, medium rare and with lots of French fries Do you want to see it again? Yes, but I'm embarrassed. Come on. If there were a museum of people that only shop.. And never buy anything, I'd belong in its exhibit. You'll buy, eventually. I promise you'll buy a camera from me How precious! You hadn't shown me this one! No, we just got it. It has a telemeter and a calibrated exposimeter. And a high price, right? Not so high. 1,490 pesos. Yeah? What a beautiful landscape. If you really want it why don't you buy it in installments? No, I hate installments. It's like selling your soul to the devil That's really funny. It's true. Advertising makes us think we can have everything we get used to buying things in installments, and to think and live in installments No, I like all or nothing. So I'll keep saving. If I bought it as if it were for me I'd get a discount How much do you have? Around 1,200 pesos. But I don't have it with me, it's in my safe box. It's such a large sum that I don't think she'll.. She'll do it, I know her well. She's an exemplary woman, a saint We should name her president of the congregation. Don't feel bad for me. As a historian, I have to recognize the superior spir.. Here you go, Father, a thousand pesos You see? Bravo, long live Gloria! As a historian, I.. I'm very grateful, my child, but I cannot accept it This is your husband's money and.. Better for you, Father, than for the bartender! Please we don't need this money, who knows what he'd buy with it just to spend it. On bad habits of course! But this is much more important to me, to my conscience. In that case thank you, child One day, your generosity and abnegation... will get the prize they deserve. I hope your example enlightens... many others. As president of the congregation, I'd like to hand over this post to this exemplary woman... who'll go down in history, and.. Excuse me Glorita, may I use your restroom? Of course. Poor thing ever since she had bladder surgery she is.. Where's my money? I beg you to respect my guests Later, alone, you can do with me whatever you want. Stop acting! This morning the money was still inside the jaguar! And I suspect it is now in a pious pocket I won't allow that kind of offense! Excuse me, Father I just made the shoe, and you put it on - Don't to him like that! - That's not the way to.. Father with all due respect, do you have my money? Well, everyone knows I didn't want to accept it. Please may I have it? Thanks. You'll just spend it all on drinking! What are you talking about? You know what this money's for. And that I've been saving it for more than two years. Yes, but the restoration of the Saint Rita's altar is more important - Of course! - That's right. Exactly. I agree, but with the congregation's money not mine. You, as historian, what do you think? Me? Well, I, being that.. You see? It's very clear. But I promised I'd buy the marble.. But, why do you want to be more than others? That's the sin of vanity right, Father? Well... You see? You are the same as the others, not more, not less I won't bother you anymore, go on with your meeting I'm sorry excuse me. I got so nervous, so nervous.. Excuse me Excuse me Then you are for crime? No, the opposite I'm against all cruelty and violence. I'm saying that man considers crime to his convenience. Let's see explain that Look for example a war pilot that would not drop.. The bombs destined to destroy a city, would be treated as a criminal the same as he who wants.. To be free in a dictatorship, or a Jew in Hitler's time. There are thousand of examples No, no, I'm talking about everyday crime. Like this drunken... It's the same, Don Amado. Look in some countries being drunk is extenuating, in others tis aggravating. Among the Latin, the man who kills an adulteress.. Has cleansed his name. But in many Nordic countries he'd be prosecuted.. As if he had murdered his own father Because they've no feelings! Or we have too much! - Another one doctor? - No, thanks, one's enough Well, I've read many detective stories.. A I of them are the same, Don Amado, look A man kills another man in a very complex way and at the end the detective solves the crime. Of course, the perfect crime doesn't exist Sure, they always miss something. Because they get scared or nervous. I suppose that you, like those who read detective stories have already imagined the perfect crime? I won't deny it, but.. Well, let's imagine you already committed murder. Nobody knows anything but you, you live in distress. The milk man knocks at the door.. And your heart beats like a drum You go outside, see a policeman and hide, you can't sleep and begin to feel sick. You think everyone knows what you've done, and the distress grows more with time, day after day, after day! But don't suffer this is just talk. That's how mistakes are made. Wearing a beard, becoming suspicious.. That's the point, that's why I said there's no perfect crime We hear it on the radio every night. It could happen. How? To be prosecuted and acquitted. I mean, be in peace with society. So, cheer up, Don Amado! Cheer up! Drinking, brother in law? And your poor wife sick at home, crying for her husband. And you here drinking away. It's insane. But I've only had one beer. A box, you mean you cannot even stand up. Me? Well, I'm also macho and I like to have fun but at the right moment. Come on let's go home. Your wife will be very happy. Sick.. Calm down, sister calm down Have some tea Here's the prodigal husband. Please don't tell him I've told you, he gets back at me when we're alone About time I went to chat with some friends. And one of them is don'tequila right? I can smell it on you I'm a grown man free to drink a beer whenever I want Yes, but not to go to the bar leaving your wife.. At home sick and alone Please sister, don't blame him, he didn't know I was sick. Sure, you put up with everything and even defend him! But it's a shame the neighbors have to call me.. Because they notice how you live. Oh, God, they're so nosy! Yes, why would that be? They love my sister, and they always see her crying... and being mistreated Because you are an evil man! Please don't insult him It's not his fault. Don't defend him! See how much she loves you? Poor thing Yes, it's shameful. I admit I give her a horrible life, and it is not fair for someone to suffer so much. And since I cannot change.. And don't notice how much I hurt you the only solution I see is to split up. She'd be happy living with you, and I'd... Get a divorce? Do you think I'm a slut? That I'd change men? No, God united us, until death do us part. The church allows it so I don't see the problem. Don't be like that You just want to get rid of me Leave me because I'm crippled! Admit it! Admit it! Admit it! You see, sister? You see? He's so rude! Take it easy, take it easy, you're a martyr, poor thing.. What a problem. I feel so sorry for Gloria. She's special, but she has a huge complex. Otherwise why would she believe what you said? Because she knows it's true Look Pablo, I love your wife like a little sister. If you abandoned her like she's, crippled penniless, after giving you her best years, she'd die of sadness, and I would be very sad and so mad, that I don't know what I'd do! Understand? Of course. I'm very smart. Good I know you're a responsible man, but when one has drank too much, one doesn't even know what has been said. What happened? Where are you going? To get some fresh air and sober up. Careful, professor. Just take it and we'll see later how you can pay me, okay? And don't worry. C'mon, I'll give you some fertilizer for your wife. By the way, you're helping me a lot I'll finally be able to buy my wife a coat.. She's been bugging me for so long. Here. Does it really work? Don't you see it is all burnt organic matter? Look look at the proof By the way, when I told the neighbors I'd burn their trash they'd pile up my yard with it, but since they found out.. I see it as fertilizer, now they'd rather wait for the trash truck. People are funny! Don't bother doctor I know the way See you, professor. See you. I'm sorry I didn't know... Get out, immediately! Get out! I'm telling you to leave! For the ma'am since she doesn't like anything.. Want some? Thank you. Here, I'll take it to her It had to be I knew you'd be watching something obscene! What, dancing is a sin? It's not the dance you're interested in, but what they show. You're always thinking about dirty stuff and pornography. I've seen the book you have on your desk full of naked women. Please Gloria, it's a photo album from Africa. So? You can be black and decent. What are you looking at? You're very beautiful. You know? Many women who look good when they're dressed, don't look so good when they take their clothes off. But you... You'd come out well next to those black women. You know I don't like it when you say those things. Why not if it is true? You have a tiny waist, and round hips like a mare, and your breasts.. How dare you?! Yes, I suspected you! But, Gloria you treat me like a stranger I'm your husband for over 15 years.. Yes, but I don't want to, let me go! Why not? You're my wife. You cannot do this to a man. That is amoral and dirty I beg you to leave me. Forget all those sick ideas, Let's try to be happy like any other couple. Gloria, I've loved you so much if only you let me.. Please Wait! Wash your hands and rub some alcohol. Here, eat Don't do that, ma'am! Don't kill him! You spy on me? What has he done to you? Only because Don Pablo loves him! Because they're the same disgusting! Always eating meat, always! And who are you to talk to me that way? A sad and insolent maid, you're fired! I'd have left a long time ago not to see you, but I stayed for Don Pablo. But before I leave I'll tell him everything. I'll slit your tongue if you dare! C'mon, get your things and out! Right now! And if I see you around here I'll accuse you of stealing and of trying to take my husband away! I... how can you say that about me? Because I know it! Besides, people will believe me, not you. C'mon, get out of here. Thief! Insolent! Is this Ms. Castro's residence? Yes, sir, come in. Thank you. Please, tell her Dr. Morales is here. Yes, sir. Shoot I'm not afraid One moment, I like meeting my enemies! Let's see this complex artifact. It's this way, right? Let's see this very complex device. So, you're not a Martian but from Venus, right? Emperor Cesar! This Roman warrior is he your brother? What's his name? - Rogelio. - Rogelio, and you? - Nina. - Nina. And tell me, Nina what were you playing? Matar... matariliri Leron.. - Excuse me? - Matarilir Leron.. Nobody would guess it. Don't tell me you understood what she said Not a word. - Good evening. - Good evening. C'mon, you go play but if you don't behave.. You'll have to leave. I never thought you were married, with children.. Sorry sorry. I'm a widow. But we only get to talk about cameras By the way, here's yours. What a beauty! I really appreciate it Because with the money I saved, I also cut down your commission, right? It doesn't matter. It's a question of pride. - Coffee? - No, don't bother It's already made, really. Well, then, yes Like that, Iguana! And you stay still! Perfect! Maestro Capito, come out! Good pose! Show me when you develop it Don't let them inside the house. Go away. I'll take some more pictures later. Hey you, out! That's what you wanted the camera for? To take pictures of dogs and brats. Those were the "important" jobs for you? What about the documents you were going to reproduce? Please let me work A right do that, throw me out. I'm not throwing you out woman. I know you can't stand me, that I'm a bore Of course, since I'm sick and handicapped you just want to get rid of me. You said it clearly. That's not true! See? You made me nervous and I cut the skin.. What have I done for you to hate me like that? I don't go out, don't spend a penny, I wait here all day for you Listen, Gloria. Your scenes are useless, everything is useless. I loved you very much and if you weren't.. As dry as you are, our life would have been so different Instead of wasting the years paying for this horrible house, we'd live in a modern apartment, happy with colored walls and lots of light.. And we'd have a couple of kids that would run.. Around the house playing and we'd roll around with them on the carpet.. Yes, and they would have come out like me right?! With a leg like this! I've told you that's not hereditary. The doctors have explained it to you, you've had X-rays.. And what do doctors know? More than you, of course. But not more than God and it is Him who sends the suffering to test us. Well, in that case, let's keep suffering. The only thing I ask from you is a little understanding.. And mostly, peace You want me to leave you alone? That I die of bitterness while you're in peace. Well, here's your peace! Why have you done that? Don't hit me, Pablo Don't hit me, no! Pablo, no, don't hit me! Pablo! You know I'd never hit you but this is intolerable! I'll leave and you'll never see me again! Don't hit me, Pablo Don't, Pablo please! Don't hit me, Pablo Don't hit me anymore! Pablo! No, don't, please Don't hit me, Pablo ...that you live among the Saints and that your blessing stays with us. In the name of.. What's going on? Something happened? The beating you gave her, bastard! Look how you left her. I... I beat her up? Gloria, tell the truth, I did that to you? Don't try to intimidate her But, Father, I give you my word that.. Silence, wretched! Be grateful I'm a priest.. And condemn violence otherwise I'd make you pay! But don't think this is the end of it, no! You'll get your punishment from above! Now, get to work. Yes, yes, I know, forgive me. Are you happy now? Please maestro... What are you doing at these hours? What a night cap you have, doctor! It's to work. Well, we were drinking, the maestro and I, and since we saw the lights on I thought.. You might still be up working. Let's invite him to the bar, we have money. Why don't you come in? No, no, please, doctor! If your wife hears us either she throws us out.. Or makes us pray That's true, and today is not a good day, she's a bit sick And I have a lot of work an emergency, so please, forgive me Well... In that case have a drink with us here. That I can do. It will do me a lot of good. Thank you. And let the fun continue. See you, professor, see you maestro - The doctor is always so nice! - Yes, he is! Everything's in its place. But I'm forgetting something.. Good morning, Father. Good morning to you. I wonder how the poor woman is doing. I hope that Judas hasn't dared.. I hope not. After Don Elodio's threats.. And he almost kills him! Good morning. Gloria's not here. What? Where did she go? She went to Guadalajara. Guadalajara? Yes, to visit an aunt, Mercedes. But, without warning? No, she begged me to say goodbye for her.. And that she'd write soon. If you don't believe me, you can come in. There's no need. Well, then, have a good day. Father I smell something fishy! Yes, there is a horrid stink! No, I'm talking about Gloria's trip. Me too child, so I will let her sister know right away. GREAT FERTILIZER SOLD HERE 1.00 PER BAG Stop, stop! I told you fights and violence don't get you anywhere. Peace, peace. But he doesn't let me see the box I already told him the box with butterflies... is for the school's museum - How's its wing? - He's almost cured What are you looking for, teacher? A jaw that fits. - And this one? - No. That one is very used. - The skeleton is real? - What? Is the skeleton real? Yes. Can I touch it? Now you can Let's see how this one fits you... Children, go play outside, I have important guests. Bye! Go, go away! Where is my sister, answer me Where is she?! - She left - To where? You're not going to give me that story.. About that aunt Mercedes who doesn't exists - No, not you - And what about me?! - Well... - What, what? Tell me where she is or.. I don't know, she left. What do you mean? Yes, last night we had a long and friendly talk. I've never seen her so reasonable, so calm. She told me she couldn't stand her life anymore... and that she was getting away from me forever. See what you did? And from you, too. - What? - Us? Why? For butting into her life, complicating it... But, why is it our fault?! Please let me finish She also told me.. That the only thing she regretted was to move away.. From the Father and those two saints. Her own words But, where did she go? And why didn't you stop her? Because for the first time we agreed on something. I understood she was a higher spirit.. That wanted to leave the mundane matter. And I had no choice but to help her. At this time she must feel really free. But something's smells fishy here Of course, Father, with all this around us. No, we have to go immediately to the police! I agree, and the sooner the better. It's possible she's not too far. Let's go. Excuse me I have to...! Maybe you're right, but if you're lying you'll end up like that! We're all going that way right, Father? Without a doubt! Come on Elodio. I'm to look for my sister until I find her Let me know if you find anything, I will try to help you find her any way I can. I'm very interested. Alone at last. I'm going to get your little leg Let's see how it fits you. Look how cute they are and how much happiness they bring. Hey you, Ner√ªn, here. See? He doesn't even want your bones It would have been so easy to gain their love and keep mine. What did I ask from you? A little affection, and mostly peace. And see what you made me do? It's what happens with men and nations, even a defenseless mouse attacks when cornered. And you cornered me. If they knew about your new state, what could happen to me? 10 years in jail? Imagine 10 years eating regularly, serving a physical punishment that makes you healthy and strong 10 years to think in my cell, to write books, a monk's life. And what is that compared to the 15 years of suffering.. I spent with you? I already purged that sentence. A terrible one. But did I say sentence? I mean, hell. Of course I should have left you a long time ago. But the responsibility, the compassion, the incredible power of the weak person Besides, I wanted you so badly. You don't know how much I liked you, of course, from the knee up. - Good morning, Father. - Not so good. That man has gone back to his profane exhibits, and that can't be, can't be! That can't.. The ske.. The skeleton.. The leg... It's her! Dear God! Gloria! My dear! Dear God! I'm going to die! And I'm going to.. to.. to... Extra! The taxidermist that killed his wife. Extra! He's not capable of that murder He told me to tell you.. To not go visit him, because that could make matters worse. Also not to worry He's very hopeful He'll be freed. He will, I know he's innocent. He killed her! That's not true. He's incapable of killing anyone. He's a drunk a hypocrite, a bandit! Dr. Morales is a good man He killed her! Yes, yes, he killed her He's capable of it and much more! Yes! Please how's he going to kill anyone? He's a simple man, everyone loves him for goodness sake! They're lost. Putting aside my unbiased position as historian I testify that the defendant always seemed to me... a useless and unwanted parasite! The night before my sister disappeared.. He beat her up until he made her bleed. That night my husband was very upset. Was there anyone else? Yes, Father Familiar and Lourditas Your Honor, I ask that those two witnesses testify. Call the witness Artemio Familiar. And let the woman know she'll also be wanted.. For her testimony. You see, Your Honor? Everyone agrees the sister, the husband, the woman You are needed. The woman? LADIES Miss? You'll be next soon. I can't go right now! I understand you can't believe it, but I know him well and I don't doubt it He's evil. Even you who deal with professional criminals, won't be able to recognize the dark soul of that Lucifer! Thank you, Father. It's your turn, colleague You have accused the defendant in such a passionate way, that one can perceive the personal resentment.. Listen, I don't care if you are a lawyer.. Excuse me Father just answer what you're asked. Did you love the missing woman? How not to love her when she was an angel? An obedient lamb that looked for perfection to save her soul. And given her nature, do you think she ever provoked the defendant? Never She would only leave her home to go to church.. And mingle with a group of pious and honorable women. She was a saint. That's it Father Does the defendant want to say anything... about the given testimonies? I'm a man full of flaws. But not as bad as you say. What happens is that next to my wife's purity and perfection.. My mistakes are made bigger. Now.. Why would I kill her? In this case, there's no motive The house I rescued with my own money.. Paying the mortgages it's under my name. Isn't that right, Ciara? Elodio? Jealousy.. Revenge.. Father Familiar since you know her better than anyone, you think she ever gave me a reason to resent her? Never Only proof of her love and dedication. But you...! Now I'd like to ask you another question, Father. Didn't she mention to you her wish to join a convent? To isolate herself? That's right. She was jealous of the missionary nuns. That's right. Poor thing Then, before you convict me, why don't you think that maybe.. She's followed her calling, and at this time, she's on her way to a far away country... to redeem the black women there and do good deeds. Maybe I made her unhappy.. But to kill her... Who kills a saint? Have the experts come in You can leave now Thanks for everything, Father. Excuse me everyone I want to add this report to the file. Dr. Quevedo could you and Dr Quinones give a brief summary of the report? Of course, you may begin, colleague. Very well. We'll start with the skull that although female is composed of several kinds of bone For example, the parietal bones belonged to a matured woman. But the inferior jaw belonged to a teenager The carpal and metacarpal bones belonged to an old person. Besides, the shoulder blades are made of plaster But the knee, the leg? What are you going to say? Studying Mrs Morales' x-rays, properly certified, as well as her medical history in detail it was concluded that her ailment was later acquired. Which means, it's not hereditary.. But consisted of an infection. He means tuberculosis. But take a look at this pelvis, pushed to the top.. And with the femur is apex going across it and the joints hypertrophied Look at the difference. Forgive my ignorance but.. this femur... Yes. This pelvis... Exactly. Are they or aren't they the victim's? Haven't we been clear enough? Even a child would have understood What? That this is not Mrs. Morales' skeleton! - Congratulations! - Thanks! I knew this would happen! Well, we have to celebrate Yes, but I have to pay a visit first. What do you want from me? I came for confession What, you? And with me? - Yes, Father. - Alright. Kneel down Begin. Father you've always hated me for no reason. You always believed all the bad things... Gloria told you about me, without bothering to find out if it was true. - If that is why you came...! - I'm in confession During trial you did all you could to ruin me. My conscience and my ministry...! The confession is mine not yours I insist you did all you could to convict me and I've come to tell you you were right, Father. What? All the accusations, the murder, Gloria's skeleton, everything is true. What are you saying, miser? The truth. I knew it! Exactly, Father. I will tell the police! No, that would be double jeopardy, besides confession is secret and sacred. You can't tell anyone anything. No, no! Then, why have you come?! Because I thought you might want to know you were right and so that you pray and ask for forgiveness for my soul, because I can't ask myself since I'm not regretful. Out! Get out, Satan! At once, Father. And thanks for patiently listening to me. Your crime will not go unpunished. You can trick man's justice, but not God's. Sooner or later you'll bear the weight of His relentless power. I toast again for our dear friend who went through.. The experience of slander, and came out without any stain - Bravo! - That's right! Well, and if you were in jail, what doesn't matter? As it is been said.. There are plumages that go across the mud... and don't get dirty. Your plumage is one of those. - Very well said! - Very well said! Thanks to everyone. You don't know how much your friendship means to me. Cheers. - Cheers! - Cheers! Come in. To what do I owe the pleasure? In the name of the congregation and the unbiased position.. That every historian must... We came to congratulate you for your freedom And to ask for your forgiveness. We are severe but just, and always slaves... of the honesty of our conscience.. Well, appearances can be deceiving and the skeleton had the leg like this.. Those are irrelevant technicalities. The important thing is that in the book of History.. I appreciate your gesture.. And I praise history and its pages, but, what matters is on this table. I want you a I to take a glass to toast... such a joyful moment for me. - Some tequila. - No, please. - Tequila is fire! - And it's diuretic. Is there anything less strong? A beer? No, beer makes me.. Now that I remember.. Just like I thought.. here is her favorite drink. - We'll get them all drunk! - Until they can't get up! Watch out the girl.. You're not going to toast with us? But of course! To always being together and in harmony like right now THE END
