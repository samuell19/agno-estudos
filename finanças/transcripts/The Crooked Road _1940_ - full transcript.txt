What is it? Looks like that they're trying to catch us at the next station. They'll never make it. We only stop for a minute. Holy catfish! Can that girl ride! All aboard! Come on! Good-bye! Bye Louise, come back soon. - Well, thanks a lot. - You always catch trains that way? It's my own fault. I would have to bring in the car. No, let me. Oh, never mind, here's the porter. Thanks again. Yes, sir. Your glasses. Eh? Oh, thanks. - Good evening. - Good evening. One? Mm-hmm. Well, I had no idea the place was gonna be so crowded this late. Crowded? Perhaps the lady wouldn't mind... Oh, yes. Perhaps the lady wouldn't mind. Well, seeing there's not a single other place left... Ah, thank you. Thanks. Begging your pardon, I've spent three solid hours thinking about you. I need help. Why? What's wrong? I'm baffled. I can't quite figure it out. Is it a rancher's daughter out to search for a mortgage? Not quite. Then, perhaps it's a beautiful debutante that flees from desert desperados. Nothing half so feverish. Ah, I know. A mysterious spy catches the express in the nick of time. Girl simply returns to her home in Los Angeles after a glorious vacation. Is that all? We can't all live in the headlines, Mr. Trent. Eh? Oh, that. Well, good thing for most of us we don't have to. Tell me, was he really innocent or would that be unethical? Oh, it would be. Very. As a matter of fact, he was innocent. I wouldn't have taken the case unless I thought so. Oh, really? Wow, it's that criminal lawyer. Ma'am, in the first place, I'm not a criminal lawyer. Oh! There was something about Cerruti's case that convinced me he was innocent. It's got to be tough living by oneself thinking of that poor devil sitting in the death house without a friend in the world. I can see how you'd feel. All right. Now I'm feeling hungry and ready to celebrate. How about splitting a bottle of wine with me on Cerruti's honor. - I'd like that. - Fine. Steward... Yes, sir. - Set them up for the crowd. - Very good, sir. Know? That takes your breath away. It's so beautiful. Oh, there's a stretch 100 miles down the line where you'll stop breathing entirely. I'm afraid I can't wait out for it. It's getting late. No, no. Don't go yet. Wait till the moon goes down. It just went. Oh, only for a minute. Here you are. It's a ring. I wouldn't doubt it. I wouldn't doubt that you're engaged, either. Well, I certainly wish you all the happiness in the world. Thanks. He's meeting me in the morning. Ah, it's careless, aloof. Careless for meeting me? No, for leaving his valuables lying about in the moonlight. They can look after themselves. I think. Well, from now on, I'm gonna keep a protective eye on them for him. Now I'm sure they'll be safe. - Good night. - Good night. Well, Bob, how are you? - John! - Oh, I'm glad to see you. Oh, who's this? Your secretary? Yes, miss Colton may I present you Mr. John Vincent, my best friend? - How do you do? - How do you do? - But go, won't you kiss her? - What? Well, you kiss all the girls, don't you? Hey, wait a minute, Bob. That's not true and you know it. But, at least, you're to kiss the girl you're gonna marry. Oh, now you told him! I bet she did do it in self-defense. Quite wrong, I was a perfect gentleman. How did you know? That ring. He told me he'd keep it till he found the right girl. Sure I did. I should've warned her to hide it. You old rascal! It would serve you right if I'd persuaded her to elope with me. Ah, get out. Come on, darling. You know, Louise? I always send for Bob when I am in a legal jam. - Really? - Mm-hmm. What's it all about this time? You get yourself settled in the hotel while I drive Louise home. We'll have lunch together and talk it over. Suits me. Well, here we are. - I'll meet you at the grill, Bob. - All right. - Good-bye. - Good-bye for now. Take this too. Glad to be back, darling? To be with you, yes, but that ranch... I'll miss it. It was wonderful. Maybe we can go together next time. But I'd never want to come home. Well, now that you're home, I'm going to try to make things interesting. How about the theater tonight? I have three tickets. Three? Yes. We can't leave Bob on the loose his first night in town. Do you mind? Well, as long as we can have a few minutes together. I think that can be arranged. I don't think Wilson saw that one. That's for the good old Wilson. Wilson does it right for himself, doesn't he? I'll see you at 7:00, dear. - All right, dear. - Bye-bye now. Hop in, buddy. Thanks for the lift. What's the matter? Lungs? Yeah. Well, this climate oughta be good for that. How long have you been here? Not very long, about a month. Oh, you oughta get out to the desert. That's good for what ails you. - The desert? - Mm-hmm. That takes money. Not too much. Not too much for a guy like you, maybe. You're a rich man. Oh! - You know who I am, huh? - Sure. How could I ever forget you, Danny? Has it been so long that you've forgotten the name... Danny. You're.. you're... confusing me with someone else. My name is John Vincent. It was Danny Driscoll when we were doing time together in that English prison. Well, that's a funny one. Ha-ha, do you think I'm an ex-convict, huh? They're still hunting for you ever since you made your jailbreak. Get out. It's no use, Danny. You know me all right. I've been trying to see you ever since I hit town, but they wouldn't let me near you at the office. I've thumbed you a half a dozen times. I've been fighting this ever since I left Dartmoor. I wasn't as lucky as you. I served my time. All right, what do you want? That's better, Danny. You and me always did get along well in the old days. Never mind that. What do you want? You're a rich man, Danny. I'll give you $1,000. You can live a long time on that. Listen, Danny, you were doing time for manslaughter. You framed me, Gobel. I never committed that crime, you know that. Oh, that's not the point, Danny. The point is they're still looking for you at Scotland Yard. And my silence ought to be worth something. All right, make it two. It's no good, Danny. You're a rich man and you wouldn't miss a hundred thousand. Oh, you're crazy! Had I see you're rot first. All right, then we're both rot. Only you'll do yours at Dartmoor. - Look here, you... - No, take it easy, Danny. Rough stuff isn't gonna get you any place. You've got all day to raise the money. Here's my address. I'll be expecting you at my house tonight. - With the cash. - Uh-huh. What makes you so sure I'll be there? Well, for one thing: the little lady wouldn't like it so well if you went to jail, would she? What little lady? Miss Colton, the girl you're gonna marry. Wait. 9:00 tonight Danny, and don't forget what I said about the little lady. How did you get in here? Don't get nervous. The door was unlocked. You expected me, didn't you? Yeah, I knew you'd be here. I was waiting for you. No need to bring that gun into the conference. Not if you brought that money with you. Here. What's the idea? There's only 5,000 here. Well, it's like this. If you're trying to crawl out on me, Danny, you... Take it easy. I don't keep a hundred thousand dollars under my pillow. You've got to give me a day or two to raise it. A day or two? After all the time it took you to catch up with me, a couple of days more won't make any difference. That's what you think. I gotta get away from here, do you understand? I gotta take a trip. Oh, so my old friend Gobel is in a jam. Now don't get any ideas. There's nobody in this town cleaner than I am. It's just a... family matter, that's all. Between me and my wife. Who? The lady I saw leaving in such a hurry? Yeah, but everything's gonna be all right once I get her away from a joint like that Pyramid. The nightclub. Yeah. You see, she's been dancing there. to kind of tie this over. And you gotta admit that's no place for a girl. Especially when her husband isn't getting any younger and not feeling too well in the bargain. Say, I'm just as good as I ever was. She just got some crazy idea about a guy, that's all. But it isn't gonna get her any place. Oh, it depends on who the guy is. He's a nobody, a mug named Nic Romero. One of these babies that women go crazy for. Nic Romero. But all that's over and done with once I get Virgie out of this town. - But it's gotta be quick, see. - Yeah, I understand. Say, you're in a pretty bad way, aren't you? Don't sell me, Danny. You're not doing me any favors. You're bringing me the rest of that money for your own good, and you know it. Yeah, I know it, Gobel. And you can trust me to take care of it. How do you like this? Hmm, it's little but very nice, thank you. The rent is 10 dollars a week. That's fine. I'll pay for a week right now. Thanks. What's the name? Atwater. Atwater. George B. Atwater. I'm here from Tulsa, Oklahoma, to attend the convention of hardware dealers. I'll bring up a receipt. No, no, don't bother about a receipt. I'll take it up in the morning. Suit yourself. Here's your key. Oh, thanks, thanks. If there's anything you want, just let me know. Yes, I will, I will. Good night. Good night. Hello, Nic. Hi, Virgie. How's the show? Rotten. I'm the only good thing in it. How's the drug business? Rotten. Can't make any money working for a drugstore. You oughta own one. How much would it take? Oh, I don't know. Three or four thousand, I guess. Every cent I earn goes for the rent and groceries. I get so sick of paying for everything! Why don't that husband of yours get himself a job? Him? All he ever thinks about is easy money. Yeah, what for instance? He was talking about that shakedown again tonight. He was? Sometimes he almost makes me believe him. Like tonight, for instance. - You know what he said? - No. Said he was shaking this fellow down for 100 grand. It was supposed to be bringing it to the house. Can you believe it? - Say, you don't think maybe... - No, of course not, it's all talk. Yeah, but just supposing it wasn't all talk. You never know what a guy like that old man of yours might be up to. Why, say, baby, if we could get our hands on that kind of money, we could go places, you and me. Oh, Nic, I can't stand seeing him anymore. Let's go now. Run out on a lot of money like that? Not me. But, Nic, it's all talk, he's always saying things like that. Yeah, but maybe this time it's not all talk. Look, you hurry up and get dressed. You're going home and find out. Okay, Nic. And, remember, if he's got that money, you call me, no matter how late it is. Hello, Virgie. You've been drinking, huh? Sure, it gets lonesome when you're not here. And the fellow didn't come. What fella? What fella are you talking about? You know very well what fella. Where's the $100,000 you were bragging about? - Oh, that. - Yeah, that. Wait a minute, Virgie. How about a little kiss before we start talking? - It didn't really come, did it? - No. What have you got? - Honey, did he come? - Yeah. It's $500 for that fur coat I've been promising. Did you get it all, Carl, the 100,000? And here's 500 more for that diamond ring you wanted. $1,000! I've never had that much money in my life! $1,000, well, that's nothing, nothing at all. Well, we're rich. Let me see it, Carl. Let me see all of it. Nobody sees no more of it until I put it in the bank tomorrow. But you can't put it in the bank. Tomorrow is Sunday. Hmm? The banks don't open on Sunday. Oh, they don't, huh? Well, I'll put it in the bank on Monday. Come on, Carl, be sweet to Virgie, eh? Oh, be sweet to Virgie! It's a different story now that I got money, ain't it? Oh, that's not it at all, Carl. Let's have a drink. Come on, let's celebrate. Oh, no, I'm going to bed. Oh, but Carl! No, and I'm gonna lock that door too. See? No one's gonna get near me as long as I got all this money. Hello. That's you, Virgie? Yeah, what? You're kidding! He's got that, I tell you. I saw it. Thousands of dollars. Great! I'll be right over. It's no use. Not tonight. He's locked up in his room. With a gun. Ah, okay. We'll give him a day to quiet down. Look, be nice to him and don't let him suspect anything. We'll take care of him tomorrow night. Yeah, good night. You got a nerve coming here, Romero. Yeah, I know Mr. Gobel, but maybe things aren't just the way you think they are. Can I come in? Yeah, come on in. In there. Sit down. Now, perhaps you'll tell me why you came. Sure. It's about this note. Never mind that. I know what you're here for. Say, what is this? Sit down and stay there. What's this all about? I came here to do you a favor. I'll do the talking, Romero. - But, please... - Shut up! Not as clever as you think you are, Romero. You thought an old man would be easy to handle, didn't you? Listen, Gobel, I wasn't thinking about the money. Oh, so you do know about the money. Well, I... What money? I don't know what you're talking about. Virgie told you about it, didn't she? I haven't seen Virgie. She called you on the phone last night when she thought I was in bed. You're both rats and I oughta drill you right now, and I've got plenty of reasons. Listen, Gobel, you're all wet about me. Now look, here's the reason I came to see you. Virgie is making a sucker out of the both of us. I thought maybe you'd like to know that. You wrote that yourself. Me? You're crazy. Why should I? Anything's a good excuse for you to get into my house. Now get out. All right, you win. And I show you there's no hard feelings. I'll even buy a drink before I go. Sure, I never refuse a drink. Not even from you. Have something to open it with? - Here's a corkscrew. - Thanks. So where is Virgie, She isn't home, is she? No, of course not. She's at the Pyramid Club. Oh, she is, huh? Yeah, but she won't be there after this week. We're going on a long trip. And when we come back up, I hope we don't see anything of you. Thanks. Here's wishing you the best of health, Gobel. Hello, Gobel. I wouldn't do that. Sit down. You didn't think I'd let you get away with it, did you? Why? I thought we was going to be friends. What is this? What are you gonna do? Can't you guess? You can't, Danny, you can't! You're wrong, Gobel. I've been waiting for this for a long time. They'll catch you, Danny, and they'll hang you. Think of it. This time they'll hang you! I'll take that chance. It's better than having you bleed me for the rest of my life. Oh, it's that. Just forget about the money and I'll go away... I... I'll never bother you again. That's where you're wrong, Gobel. The thought of you scheming somewhere would bother me a great deal. I'd always expect you to try again. - Wait a minute, Danny... - You're a natural crook. You couldn't keep a promise. I'd be a fool to trust you. Danny, I got something important to tell you. Go ahead. All right. Danny, hear... Can I have a drink first? Sure. Help yourself. Hello. Virgie? Never mind that. Where have you been? The Anchor hotel? Waiting for me? Well, how did I know? I've been looking for you. Nic, they found him, Carl I mean. Why did you have to shoot him for? I didn't want you to do that. What's that? Did you say he was shot? Are you sure? All right, you fool, don't talk on the phone. I didn't, I tell you. He was as much alive as I am when I left him. He was alive when you left him, huh? Nic, answer me! Nic, say something! Here's that woman now. Slip out and have this call traced. We wanna pick her up for questioning. Okay. Say, what is this? Anyway, what do you mean busting into a man's room? Tell me, Romero, who was alive when you left him? I don't know what you're talking about. You don't, eh? You ever see this before? I didn't write that. No? There must be some other Nic Romero. I tell you I didn't shoot him. How'd you know he was shot? She told you? Kind of sweet on her, ain't she? Oh, I see her some times. You thought you'd shake her old man down for a piece of change. Where'd you hide the gun? - I tell you I didn't shoot him. - You have a gun, haven't you? What'd you do with it? That call was traced all right. She's down the Anchor Hotel. Headquarters will pick her up. Yeah, take a look at that. Check out the letter 'e'. Drops out of line. Oh, what do you know! It's the same machine. I didn't write that. - All machines are alike. - Yeah, that's what you think. Boys, look around for his gun. Now, what time were you at Gobel's tonight? Come on, Romero, we've got plenty of witnesses that saw you in that part of town. I tell you I didn't shoot him. He was alive when I left. What time was that? About eight o'clock, I guess. Yeah, that was it. I had to meet a guy at nine. What's that? You met someone at nine? Where did you meet this party at nine? The corner of 29th and Hyacinth. And, of course, you know his name. That's a funny thing. He never showed up. No, they never do. I can prove it. I've got a letter here. Oh, I remember, it's on the floor somewhere. Yeah, here it is. Let's see those other notes. See? Same machine. Smart guy. Writing your own alibis. This is all screwy to me. I tell you I didn't write it. You're trying to frame me. Come on, Romero, where's that gun? That's it. That'll prove, won't it? Guns are different, aren't they? Sure, no two gun barrels shoot alike. It's over here. Look I'll show you. It's gone! Somebody stole it. Must've been that guy at 29th and Hyacinth. Is this it? Yeah, where'd it come from? Under that cushion over there. - How'd it get there? - Maybe you parked it in your sleep. 38... and fired recently. Two slugs missing. Well, what's that got to do with it? Gobel was shot with a 38 at 9:15, just about the time you were meeting your unknown pal in Hyacinth Street. - Come on, Romero. - This is a frame-up, I tell you. I didn't shoot him! Well, well, come in, come in. Where you two have been on this Saturday night? Oh, where haven't we been? Honeymoon Express, Lover's Slide... Birdie's House, Human Roulette Wheel. Oh, don?t forget Necker's Paradise. Sshh! And did you? Of course not, darling. We brought all these things home, just to show you how we spent our time. There's one thing you can't have. That is Love's Young Dream, what do you think of that? Oh, ain't it awful? No, it's very pretty. Tell me, darling, how's the man from Seattle? Was he putty in your hands? All washed up. I'll never have to see him again. Good. Did you make any money out of it? Money? Not exactly. But I think I saved about $100,000. Nicholas Romero, for the power vested in me by this Commonwealth, I hereby direct that you shall be taken to the State Penitentiary and that during the week of June the 15, in the manner prescribed by the laws of this state, you shall be put to death. And may God have mercy on your soul. Better luck next time, Phil. Yeah, but I hate to lose a client, especially this way. It's tough. - I wanna see Phil Wesner. - Sorry, Mrs. Gobel, he's in conference. What with? A couple of jacks? Hey, wait a minute, you can't go in there, he's... Oh, hello Virgie. What are you doing to get Nic out of this? - Well, I made an appeal, didn't I? - Did you? Sure, but it was denied. But that didn't stop me. I came right back and applied for commutation to life imprisonment. Did you get it? Mmm, application denied. What are you gonna do about it? Well, there isn't much left in the book. But you've got to find some way out, Phil. For me. Say, there may be a couple of other angles in this case I haven't thought of before. I can't offer you much, but... We needn't go into that now, Virgie. There's the $4,000 they found on Carl. I'll give you part of it. - You insist on talking about money. - I'll give you half of it! All, right, I'll do it. For you. That's awfully sweet of you, Phil. Hey, wait a minute, wait a minute. Once I get Nic out, where will I be? Up in this office counting $2,000. Yeah. Hey, Hank come here a minute, will you? We gotta think. We just moved into the higher brackets. We got a fee. - On what case? - Oh, we don't have a case. That's why we gotta think about some way to get a retrial for Romero. Say, only a Clarence Darrow or a Bob Trent could do that. - Even they... - Trent! You know him? Know? I helped him win a case in one of the toughest police courts in the country. Yeah, you helped him. Sure. Kept my eye on his hat in court while he was pleading. We're pals. Why don't you ask him to take a look at the evidence? Maybe he can help you find an angle. Wait a minute. Wait a minute. Don't bother me, I'm trying to think. - Say, I got a great idea! - What is it, Phil? I'll go over and see Bob Trent. Get it? Have him take a look at the evidence. See what I mean? Maybe he can have a new angle. Do you understand? Yeah, I understand. Funny how that thought just came to me. And then these detectives busted and grabbed me. That's all I know. Well, why don't you laugh? You like poetry? Huh? Take this down. Write as fast as you can. "I sometimes think that never blows so red." "The rose as where some buried Caesar bled." - "That every hyacinth..." - Hey, wait a minute! You're not gonna plead insanity, are you? No. Go ahead. "That every hyacinth the garden wears" "dropt in her lap for some once lovely head." That's all. What are you gonna do with that? Enter it in a spelling contest. Keep your chin up, Romero. "Hyacinth". Whoever wrote this, fulfilled it correctly with a "C". Nic, you see, spells it with an "S". Whatever, Bob, dumb guys like Romero never spell twice the same way. Quite so, but when they guess the word, they rarely spell it correct. Romero was obviously guessing at hardship. You see, guess wrong. I told the jury Romero was framed and I can still hear them laugh. Bob, we've got to find someone who knew both Romero and Gobel. Say, what about Virgie? She knew them both. Oh, not that I intend to incriminate Virgie. Don't get me wrong. And why not incriminate Virgie? if she deserves it. You know what I think? I think Mr. Wesner is getting sweet on Mrs. Gobel. No doubt about it. Look at the gleam in his eye. Now you don't see us going around with the gleam, do you? Don't see us getting romantic? What are you talking about? Who's getting soft on Virgie? Besides, she was at the Anchor Hotel when this happened. She's got a 14-carat alibi. Even so, Phil. It's a bad business falling in love in a murder case. You never know who the guilty party will turn out to be. The house has been closed since the night it happened. I've been living at the hotel, but I'm moving back in a few days. I see. That's where they found him. Oh, it's horrible, Bob! You wanna quit? No, it's too exciting. Look, Bob, what's that chalk mark over there around that broken glass? Ah, that? The police must have done it. What for? Well, that's where the water was spilled. Isn't that right, Mrs. Gobel? That's right. I left everything just the way it was. I've been too worried to bother. - Virgie, I'm worried about you. - Why? Mmm, living all alone in the world... Why don't you bring me the 4,000 bucks the cops found on Carl? - It's impounded. - It's not, it's mine. Yeah, but don't forget half of it it's mine. Don't forget my fee, Virgie. I wanna find that dough as much as you do. Then, why don't you do something about it? Well, I might try again. and let you know later. - Suppose I call you about 8:30. - Okay, on the telephone. Phil, come in. Let me have that flashlight of yours, will you? Thanks. Well, look at that! What is it, Bob? I'm not sure, but I think they're bloodstains. They must have come from Gobel. You think so? He had to get here. Gobel was shot over there, at least twelve feet away. Now the gun that shot him was fired from this position. But how do you know that? Ah, there's the mark in the book case where the police dug the bullet out that passed through Gobel's body. You see? This rod indicates the angle of the bullets flight. Points to where it was fired. That's low, here about a foot or two off the floor. Now, if the murderer was down amongst all this glass, he couldn't help but be cut. That's where the blood came from. Why didn't the police find these spots? Because the carpet was wet at the time. The water dried and the bloodstains remained. Romero didn't have any cuts or wounds on him when he was arrested. He didn't? Then, Bob, all we've got to find is a man who knew both Romero and Gobel. A man who was wounded. Now if you could just tell us his name, we'd be all set, Lady Sherlock Holmes. Just what Atwater said is he's attending a hardware merchants convention. And the Chamber of Commerce says there was no such Convention. The landlady found a towel in Atwater's bathroom with bloodstains on it. So you see, John, if we can just find Atwater... What then? Well, then we might have the murderer of Carl Gobel. Oh, why? Just because a man named Atwater cut himself shaving? Bob's having tests made of all stains. The spots on the carpet and on the towel. Well, what good will that do him? Well, if we can prove they came from the same blood group, we'll have even better reasons to suspect that Atwater. - I beg your pardon, sir. - Yes? Mr. Trent is wanted on the telephone, sir. Oh, thanks. John, you have no idea how fascinating it is. You've been seeing a lot of Bob lately, haven't you? Well, yes I have. You're kind of fond of him, aren't you? John, you're not worried about Bob and me, are you? Of course not. Oh, because you mustn't be. We're just working this out together and... it's fun and... Darling, I'll never worry over you about anything, until you tell me to. Oh, Bob! Hey, come here, don't run away. You know, I haven't had a chance to kiss Louise for a long time. She's been so busy sleuthing with you. Oh, they won't be long before you have her all for yourself again. Bob, what do you mean? - I wired Oklahoma about Atwater. - You did? Phil just phoned me. The hardware Association never even heard of him. Then, he lied about that. I suspected it as soon as his suitcase and clothes turned up. They were found in the vacant lot next to the apartment house. - Oh, you found them. - With the fingerprints. - Are you sure? - Positive! He wiped everything clean: the handler of the suitcase, the fastenings, even the shoes, but he made one mistake. Yes? What was that? He forgot the buttons on the coat. Oh! And you thought of it. Oh, Bob, it's closing in, isn't it? It certainly is with that set of fingerprints. I've made tests of the blood from both Romero and Gobel. Well? And those bloodstains on the carpet came from an entirely different blood group. And they didn't come from Romero? Absolutely impossible. Does that mean Romero will go free? No, but at least he'll get a new trial. That's something. Furthermore, Mr. Trent, I'm positive that the carpet stain and those on the towel both came from the same man. You are? Why? Because I found traces of malaria germs in both. That's a very uncommon thing to be found in Californians. Atwater again. We got to find Atwater. Thank you. Come on, we're gonna see the District Attorney, the trial Judge, the Governor himself, if we have to. Philip Wesner says, Philip Wesner discloses, Philip Wesner predicts... Not a word about what Bob Trent does. That was the bagging, you know, Phil was to get all the publicity. He's pushed The Wanderers right off the front page. - Hello dear. - Hello, darling. Come on you two, get into your things. - Look, John, have you seen it? - What? Oh, so you pull it off, Bob. We pulled it off. In spite of all your ribbing. You acted as if you really wanted us to fail. Oh, no, don't be silly. It must be a great relief for the man who framed Romero. He has a conscience? The man who deliberately framed another into the death penalty. No, it may have had reasons. Of course, to save his neck. A man like that doesn't deserve any sympathy. He'll get none either when I find him. When you find him? We're not going on with this, Bob. I'm not gonna quit now. Not till I find Atwater. Well, that prove rather difficult. We're trying everything. I've already sent a set of fingerprints to England. Well, why England? Oh, none on record at Washington. And since Gobel had a criminal record at Scotland Yard, I thought if there was any connection, Atwater might have one too. Uh-huh. Don't you see, John, that Bob can establish a relationship between the two? And we'll have our motive, you know, revenge or something like that. Yeah, well that's all quite clear, but I don't see how that leads to Atwater. No, he'd covered his tracks pretty well. Well, then he has nothing to worry about. Even from Bob Trent. Colton and Trent, please don't forget the firm. Oh, come on. I'll change. You too if you wanna go somewhere for dinner. All right, we'll be right with you. - Hello, Mr. Vincent. - Oh, hello there, how are you? Where's Bob? He's out in front of the house. I'd better see him. It's very important. Not important enough to miss a drink, is it? Well, if you put it like that... Oh, by the way, this is Mr. Thompson, from the DA's office. - Oh, how are you, Mr. Thompson? - How do you do? He's working with me on the case. How long before you'll wash this thing up? You know, I've been needing Bob at the office very badly. Well, the way things are breaking, it's only a matter of days now. Fine. Anything happening? Plenty. Well, uh... have you heard from Scotland Yard? Yes, we have. Mm-hmm, anything startling? Well, it's sort of confidential for the moment. Oh, I see. Well, here's how! Shall we go? Louise, I think the firm of Colton and Trent has been so successful that it'd better be resolved. Why? You know very well why. It's because I'm in love with you. That wouldn't matter so much, but... I think you're in love with me, too. You know I am, Bob. So in the best interest of the firm, I think we'd better not see each other anymore. I'm not sure I can be that noble about it. I don't believe in being noble either, that's a fools attitude, but... how can I say "John, I value and respect your friendship so much but I'm taking your girl away from you". And I can't say "darling, I never really loved you, but I thought this love was admiration and affection". I can't say that to him. I know. Well, I'd better step out of the picture. Yes, you can step out. I have to stay here and pretend. That's not even fair to John. Darling... Should we tell him now? Yes. Bob, it's in the bag. Thompson's bag. You were right, Mr. Trent. Scotland Yard has identified the Atwater's prints. I have the reports right here. Atwater's real name is Danny Driscoll. He's wanted in England for manslaughter and jail breaking. - Then, you were right. - We were right. Driscoll escaped from Dartmoor Prison 20 years ago. - He and Gobel... - Gobel? Gobel and Driscoll were in business with another man. The partner was killed during a dispute over money. Driscoll went to prison for manslaughter, while Gobel turned King's evidence and got only 5 years. He served his term, but Driscoll escaped. There's your motive, Bob. Driscoll found Gobel and killed him for revenge. We'll get Atwater now. It's only a question of time. You'd make a great detective, Mr. Trent. Here are the pictures of Driscoll's prints and Atwater's. See those lines? They check exactly. Frightening, isn't it? It's a picture of Driscoll taken 20 years ago. Good-looking fellow, ain't he? Reminds me of somebody I've known. - Ever been in jail? - Of course, not, silly. This is Driscoll's description. I'll have the landlady check it for resemblances to Atwater. Age, 25 years, this is 20 years ago, you know. Height, 5 ft. 11". Weight, 180 pounds. Eyes, blue. Medical history, appendectomy, black water fever and malaria. Must've lived in the tropics. What makes you say that? Well, John had a touch of it down there. He says most cases come from the tropics. Distinguishing marks, anchor tattooed on lower right arm. Anchor. When did I see an anchor before? I remember: That fellow we met at the pool. On his right forearm too. What of that? That was John Vincent. Let me see that picture. 20 years makes a lot of difference. You add 20 years to that face and you'd have a dead ringer for John Vincent. You're talking nonsense, Thompson. I guess I am, but the malaria checks and the tattoo marks check. Did he use any of these glasses? Yes, that one. Have you a powder pot? May I have it, please? Let me take a moment to find out if this is nonsense. Here you are. Take a look at that. Danny Driscoll, George Atwater, John Vincent, all the same man. I guess this information rates another drink with Mr. Vincent. I'm afraid I'll have to pass up this one. You're right. I'm Danny Driscoll. I've run away from that name for 20 years. I knew it would catch up with me sooner or later. You're under arrest for the murder of Carl Gobel. Yes, I killed him. I killed him because he threatened to destroy the only happiness I've ever known. I didn't commit that crime that I was sent to prison for in England. Gobel framed me. It's too late to prove that now. He's dead. And if any man deserved to die, it was Gobel. If any man had the right to kill... I can see now. No man has ever had. Because you premeditated your crime and planned to involve an innocent man, you must expect no leniency. Therefore, it is the sentence of this Court, that some time during the week of August 1st, in the manner prescribed by the laws of this state, you shall be put to death. May God have mercy on your soul. Bob, what are we going to do? I don't know. Yes? Mr. Robert Trent calling long distance about the John Vincent reprieve. Tell him I'm sorry, but I cannot interfere. No. Says he can't interfere. Is there anything else we can do? We've done just about everything. All we need now is a first class miracle. Do you want a miracle? You get a phone call. Hello. Oh, hello Virgie. What? Oh, it's Mrs. Gobel now that Nic is out. All right, Mrs. Gobel, the Court turned over the money left by your late lamented husband. I've got two thousand dollars for you down here at the office. What? Oh, well, that's too bad you're not feeling well. Maybe the money will cheer you up. Don't get pinched in the way now for speeding. All right, lady, get going. Call an ambulance, quick! It's Virgie, Bob, she's dead. Suicide nothing. You don't take poison in the middle of traffic. Just a minute. It's Phil. He says Virgie's dead. Poisoned. Uh... You sure she was coming from her house when it happened? Uh-huh. All right. Well, I'm going out to Virgie's house now. Meet me there. Bob, why should anyone want to poison Virgie? I don't know, but I've got an idea. Come on. How does that smell like? - Peanuts! - Exactly. Virgie said she wasn't feeling well when I talked to her on the phone. Hey look, it says on the bottle good for headaches and general rundown condition. If she took one just before she left, the tablet would take a few minutes to dissolve. Probably started to work just about the time she stopped at the traffic signal. But, Bob, Gobel was taking those tablets. Why didn't they kill him? - They did. - But he was shot. Gobel was already dead. He died a few seconds before John shot him. How can you be so sure? There's no other way of explaining, why he didn't fire his gun. He had John down on the floor, helpless, blinded by the water, had the gun in his hand... He never pulled the trigger. Why? Because he was dead, that's why. Then, John... Isn't guilty of murder, whatever else he may have done. Come on, we gotta get the Governor on the wire. Hello, Trent. You need me? Like a drowning man needs a straw, Mr. District Attorney. - Bet that you're just in time. - For what? John Vincent didn't kill Gobel. He was poisoned. - You're crazy. - I don't think I am. And if we can prove that Gobel swallowed poison, the Governor's got to stay the execution. What's the coroner say? I'm waiting for him to say it now. Ah, here he is. Well? - Well, we did find a trace. - You did? But not enough to poison a man. Then, you can't state it was the cause of Gobel's death. No, sir. That was months ago. If there are still traces of it now, sure it is enough to kill him then. Well, there might have been. I can't make a decision on what might have been, Trent. Sorry, I can't do what you want. Ben, wait. - I want you for a witness. - Witness? Witness to what? We're going to arrest the murderer of Carl Gobel. Come on. - Where's the boss? - Back there. Well, what are you on? I see you've given Romero his old job back. Sure, why not? Just because a man makes a mistake? He still has to make a living. If you men wanna talk private... No, no, no. Nic, I want you to hear this. This is the District Attorney, Mr. Benton. We warn you that anything you say may be held against you. Are you crazy? I haven't done anything. Is this one of yours? I guess it is. Got my label on it. What's in these tablets? Harmless drugs for nervous and rundown people. You look as if you need a bottle yourself. I never mind the wisecracks. What would you say if I told you to look for cyanic acid? Well, I'd know you're crazy. Those tablets are made and sealed right here in this store. Nobody touches them but me. And Nic, who helps fill the bottles sometimes. I see. Exactly what I thought. Well, Romero, you don't have to write any poetry this time. Well, I don't know what you're talking about. You went to Gobel's house that night. You're nuts! All you had to do is to reach out and help yourself. Did you touch that bottle? Sure! And I fed it to Gobel. Put down that tube, Nic. Look out, folks. It's gas. Poison! You tell them, doc. One move and we'll all take a whiff. This isn't gonna help you, Nic. - Hold it, Trent. - Come on, hand it over. Help me! Help me! Watch this out, folks. It's poison gas! Get him to the nearest hospital, quick! You had the confession. Get the Governor. There is the telephone. All right, I'm ready. Forget it, Mr. Vincent. The Governor signed a reprieve. Good-bye, dear. Take good care of her, Bob. That won't be too hard. We'll be seeing you in a month, John. Are you coming over on your honeymoon? Say, that's fine. Now I do have something to look forward to. - Good-bye. - Good-bye. Good-bye. Well, looks like you and I are gonna see a lot of each other before we arrive at Scotland Yard. - Have a cigar. - Thanks.
