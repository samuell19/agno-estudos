A wonderful Song, right? I could play it again and again. What do you think? I could listen to it all the time. You know what? Let's play it again. Respect! Are you out of your mind? Don't run over the chicken! - You must be crazy! - That's the shortest way! - What about Beppi? Damn! Lucky! Hi! The tractor is in the way. I'll move it rightaway. So you're still allowed to drive a tractor? 0.2 percent alcohol in your blood, that's actually quite a lot. I've got to show you something. So? What do you think? "The witches' tribunal or the stolen lucky pig". Extravagant. Shit, what was that? Shit! How did that happen? Shit! Of course I'll pay for your wall. I'm an idiot. - Only because I've gotten used to that. Damnit! - Drive your truck back a bit! Shit! My rabbits! Shit! Damn! Karl? Maybe he's asleep. - Say it now! - But I feel stupid! Stupid? Do you know what happens? ...if people constantly create trouble and don't have to pay the consequences? - No. - They have to appear before the Last Judgement. - What? If they die... ...they will be sentenced to purgatory. And now I will show you what that will be like. You have a few sins too many. And it's better... ...to suffer for them now. Are you crazy? Stop it! Then say it! Sorry Karl, that you are no longer alive because of me. Sorry Walpurga, that you are no longer alive because of me. Sorry Vinzenz, that you are no longer alive because of me. That's all, now untie me! The rabbits, yes. - So go on then... - And who else have you killed? - What? - Tell me. I don't know. You don't know? No. - Mom! - What? - You killed her. And now you'll apologize for it. - Read! - For ever and ever, Amen. Read the date! 8th of August 1995. Do you notice anything? My birthday. And the day Mom died! She died, because you were born. You killed her. I thought she died in a car accident? Say it! What are you doing there? - Are you crazy? - Somebody needs to tell him that he killed Mom! If you're afraid of it... Have you gone completely mad? That's how you treat your brother? Who do you think you are? But the rabbits... We would have culled them soon anyway! - Really? - Of course. You saw how fat they've become. You should've said that earlier. Asshole! Franz! Come here! Wenn will we finally get to read the third act? We're here to rehearse. Cold cuts please! No onions! No cheese! - The premiere is in 5 weeks. - At the end there is less text and more play. I see, more play. And I also need to mention this: Irmengard, the dirty pig, - the dirty swine, the damn... - When will you eventually know it by heart? And I also need to mention this: Irmengard, the dirty swine... the sneaky, backstabbing pig, in the middle of the night... Meixinger is the worst pig of them all... It's not your turn yet! At "night" it's my turn, you just said so, didn't you? So how does it continue? But she is completely innocent! Innocent? How can you call this woman innocent, if her hands still smell like Meixinger's pig? I wash my hands of it. I swear, by the holy cat of Saint Emeran. The lucky pig of Meixinger ran after me. I wanted to bring it back, and I didn't know that it brings good luck. It only brought me bad luck. Witch, you have turned Meixinger's lucky pig into a bad luck pig! In the name of God, Burn her at the stake! Now it's my turn! No! Sorry Mom, that you're no longer alive. Sorry Mom, that you're no longer alive. Sebastian Schneider, died today. A total of 2713 unrepented sins. 2713! Terrible. Took Graudinger's credit card when he was drunk and helpless and helped himself to 23 Euros from his account. He is only a little boy! Stole a pack of condoms from Tony's parents, peed into them and then hung them on the tree in the teacher's garden. Aren't you ashamed of yourself? Watched Flori's big sister getting undressed and tore off the power cable. Took a photo of Proske while he was shitting at the pub and posted the photo at the public community board. Pulled Evi's bicycle up the flagpole at the fire station. He's only a little boy. Ran over Franz's hand, Disgraced the display for the May festival... Friedrich, Walpurga, Karl, Vinzenz... altogether seven rabbits. Responsible for the death of his own mother. And therefore made Franz an orphan and Lorenz a widower. That's a total of, roughly, about almost exactly... I can't help you any more. ...14 years of purgatory! Throw him off! 2, 3 years ago, you also played a woman. That was hilarious. They all laughed. Yeah, right. They made fun of me. What woman here would play? Are you still up? Don't you have school tomorrow? Can't sleep. Have some beer with us, that'll help. Sit down. Sepp, don't forget your bag. Yeah, yeah. - Thanks. - Merci. Thank you. What's up with you? Why are you looking like that? I really don't want to die. You're silly, you don't have to die. At least not anytime soon. I don't want to die at all! Everyone dies someday, and that's good, because dying is part of it all. Look here. If Sepp and Martin and... Hubert! Right, Hubert! Alfons, Hans and Paule, if they were all still alive, then... then there wouldn't be any more space here at the table. And that's the reason we all die. In the figurative sense. But vampires don't need to die. Right. - That's correct. - He's right. Why don't you get bitten by one, then you will become one and won't die. But there's no vampires in real life. Yeah, not here, but in Transylvania... Transylvania! You guys don't have a clue. Don't believe anything they say. If you want to hear a sermon, you might as well go to church. Immortal... We will only be immortal in the custody of our creator, Whose kindness will someday select us for the life after death. So what do I do now? So, what now? Believe, Sebastian. Believe. Sorry. He's back there, Ms Kramer. No, go on. What a morning, Mr Schneider! I wish it was already evening. Be glad you don't need to take care of anyone. I need to cook... Grandma is so tough. She doesn't eat anything, and she still wakes up every morning. Imagine your wife hadn't died, but had required nursing care. You are lucky. It's true... I wanted to ask you, if you will come to my birthday party. It's my birthday tomorrow, but I'm celebrating on Saturday. So, it would be nice, if you could come. Sure. Although you always have to be so polite at your place. Oh well... What are you doing there? I'm trying something. I need to make up for something. Come on, Evi. We don't have a lot of time! Yeah, I'll be right there. Ms Kramer, can you please plug it in? That one? Exactly. Shit... Too much power for reanimation. I could have told you so before. It's different with a cat, they have 7 lives, a rabbit only has one. Why does a cat have 7 lives? Evi, come on! That's the way it is. I've gotta go. Sebastian, dinner is ready! Yeah, I'll be right there! Shit! Have you washed your hands? Yes. So, have some food. It's ragout of rabbit. What? If we eat them, they will become a part of us and will live on. - Is that right, Dad? - Yes. I wonder how cat ragout would taste? What do you mean? I think Beppi has already had six lives. Leave me alone, asshole! If I die, I'll go to purgatory, because I've killed Mom. But you didn't kill your Mom directly. No, only indirectly. Also, your Mom lives on in you. Do you understand? Where do you think you got the mark on your nose from? I don't know. And what is it called? Birth mark/Mother's mark. Exactly. You have the genes of your mother. And when you have children, they will also have the genes of your mother. Look. Xaver... His great grandfather played the trumpet, as did his grandfather, and his father. And what does he play? Trumpet. So you see? - You only need to reproduce, and you will become immortal. - And how? Yeah, how... Well... Well, reproduction, that's when... That's something very nice, you know? And you can... well... ...reproduce yourself! But how do you do it? How it is done... - Here you go. - Merci. First you need a rabbit. We don't have any more rabbits. Not like that. I meant like a nice girl. And then? Then you go up close to her, bite her earlobe and whisper "do you want to shag?" and you will become immortal. Cheers. Happy birthday to you, Happy birthday to you, Happy birthday, dear Evi, Happy birthday to you. When you talk on the telephone, your voice gets changed into electromagnetic waves, which are transferred via radio towers. And they send the signal to a satellite. Sa-tel-lite. And a radio transmission works in the same way. Now I have a surprise for you, or better, my husband Alfred. You know he works at M Radio. Listen. So, friends, today it's not only Mother Teresa's birthday, but also the birthday of Cleopatra, Janis Joplin and of our wonderful, unique Evi... Kramer! Best wishes to your 11th birthday! And also... You, dear Evi, and your whole class 5c, can visit me here and see, how it all works. Isn't that great? Yeah, that's great! So let's have a break. Our first class is English. Sebastian? What's up? Can I help you? Are you crazy? Would you possibly want to shag? What? - Is that a no? - No! Do you like it? Yeah. Schneider? For you, Papa! I'm busy right now. He's busy right now. She says it's urgent. Hello, here is Ms Dorstreiter, Sebastian's teacher. Could you come to the next parent-teacher consultation? That's quite difficult right now. Has he done anything? Not directly. But he exhibited unpleasant behaviour. - Has he done anything? - I'd like to know where he's getting these things from. Does he really blow up rabbits? They would have been culled anyway. Ok. And today he asked me: "Do you want to shag?" What? - "Do you want to shag?" Do I have a hearing defect? Please don't be disturbed. It's just Mr Schneider. Alright! So then... Consultation on Tuesday. He should come by. - 7pm. But only since it's him. I'll sleep at the station until then. Hang on. Calm down. You didn't get the first half. Oh, there was more! Is the first half just as interesting? I'll call you back again later. - It's a bit inconvenient right now, her husband is at home... - That's OK. If you'd excuse me... Mr Schneider's 11 year old son asked me today: "Do you want to shag?" So I called his father. I see. Well then... That's a very strange boy. Why? I'd also like to shag you. This meadow needs to be mowed. Hey, look down there! If we fall down there, we all die. Please wait! Tony! Stay together! Wait! "Wish to the universe". We breathe in consciously and concentrate. You have the photo in front of of yourself and wish for his return. Now send your wish from your heart out into the universe. Don't be too demanding on your destiny. Let things happen to you. And if it doesn't happen to be this week, then tune in again next time to. "Wish to the universe". What's up with you, Evi? We're going in now. All around me are the kids from class 5c of the middle school of Germringen and their charming teacher. They want to know how it all works. How does radio work? I speak into hear, and your parents listen to it, in the car, in the kitchen, in the basement, on the tractor, everywhere. And Alfred will tell you today, how it all works. What do you want to hear first? What's that here? A plectrum/pick. You need that to play the guitar. This one belonged to John Ferdinand Woodstock. - Who was that? - After Jimi Hendrix John Ferdinand Woodstock... was the best guitar player in the world. And who is Jimi Hendrix? Jimi Hendrix. I can't believe it. You have know who Jimi Hendrix is. Dear listeners, this is our school system. The students don't even know the most elementary knowledge. There is Sebastian. Let's take our first steps to essential musical education. James Marshall Hendrix, "Jimi", born on 27th November 1942 in Renton, near Seattle. That's in Washington, in the USA. He got his first guitar at the age of 5. When he was 15, his mother died. He died at the age of 27. But he still is immortal. Why immortal? Immortal... because he has made music, which today, 35 years after his death, is still played by every radio station in the world. It's the same will all you see there: Otis Redding, Elvis Presley... and now John Ferdinand Woodstock will play a song for us. This is his greatest hit: "Slipping Down the Universe". Does anyone want to greet anyone? - So? Oh well... - Yes! Look, there a courageous boy. Come here. - You need to speak into here. What's your name? - Sebastian. Sebastian Schneider. This is Sebastian! Sebastian! Sebastian Schneider? Oh, it's you. - Why? - Nothing. - So now. - Inge, turn it up! - What? - The Kandler boy is on the radio. Turn it up! And you can hear this everywhere? Of course. Good. Then I'd like to greet my Mom. And I'm sorry I killed you. And that you're no longer alive because of me. Maybe she really can hear me. And if Mr Behrends is listening: I'm sorry about the superglue on your chair and the dogshit under your doormat. I'm sorry. And I want to apologise to Ms Huber in whose soup I spat when I served her since she didn't give me a tip although I'm always friendly. And Papa says, that he always does the same. But I promise, - ...it will never happen again. - Guys, if he doesn't turn into a Rock 'n' Roller, I don't know what! But now it's time for. "Slipping Down the Universe". Did you hear that? Nice, huh? Give me the guitar and never touch it again. Out of my sight! What kind of crap were you talking about! I need the guitar! It doesn't belong to you, but to Mom. Now it's mine! Hello Mom. I hope you heard the apology on the radio. Papa heard it, but he wasn't too happy about it. I've done quite a lot of bad things. And when I die, I'll go to hell. And you're in heaven. And again we won't be together. That's why I don't want to die and want to learn to play the guitar like you. Will you allow me to? It would be nice if you could give me a sign. Any sign. I see. Great! Thanks! Excuse me, is this seat free? Of course. Are you going to Transylvania? No. To Innerbittlbach. Great guitar, huh? Check out the sound. Sounds great - Yeah... But maybe a bit too big for you. Watch... Try... this one. It's available as a starter-set with a CD and book. No, I'll take that one and no other. My Mom has already played it. How much does it cost? - 1650. I'll have to take out credit for that. Credit? You bastard! I'm telling you in good faith: Although he's not 12 yet, there are ways, to avoid this in the future. Thank you for the lecture and get home safely. By the way, on the way here I ran over one of your chicken. I'll replace that for you, of course. Goodbye! That's OK. "I'm sorry". Take it. First we have to loosen it. You see, carefully. You see? That's the one. - Careful. - There. You... I'm sorry. For what? For that. I'm sorry, too. Sorry. - Sorry! - Sorry... He came home with the police again. Lorenz is overburdened. It's a difficult age. That's just because there's no mother. Otherwise it would look different here. That's only the beginning of the end. Sophie was something special when she played her guitar. She made you burn inside. It was heartbreaking. She put a spell on you. He needs a proper wife, one with a brain, good skills and a cute ass. One that tells him off once in a while. And how shall he meet her here? He is overwhelmed. But it's no use, we need to help out. He just wanted to play guitar, so that his mother lives on. Because he has the genes. As if! That was a crooked trick to become immortal, so that he doesn't have to come here. He doesn't care about his father at all! Instead of repenting his sins, he wants to get around dying. Sebastian, my fingers are bleeding! You turned Meixinger's lucky pig into an unlucky pig! In God's name, burn her at the stake! Yeah! Hello, Mama. I know, how I can make up for everything. In the pub they said... especially Mr Gumberger that its about time that Papa, that Papa meets a new woman, because he is overwhelmed. And I will take this into my hands, because it's all my fault, That he's on his own. I don't know if you will like that. That's why I wanted to ask you to give me another sign. Mama, do you mean Ms Kramer? My god, Sebastian! Are you blind? Didn't you see me? Excuse me, Ms Dorstreiter, but I don't have any time. Here, these are for you, Ms Kramer. From my father. He said, take the flowers, because Ms Kramer, she's got a brain, skills, and a cute ass. Open mine first. For when you're thirsty. Ms Kramer. That's the best cake I've ever had. Where's it from? - I made it myself. - Really! I though it was from the bakery. If my dad could do that, a lot more people would come on Saturdays for coffee. But you're closed on Saturdays. Exactly. Can I have another one? Of course. Hand it over. - Thanks Tony. - Let me show you. You've got to shoot the zombies. No, no. Not on a beautiful day like today! But it's my birthday. Can't you keep yourselves occupied? - There. - Thanks. In our days there was no TV, only games like "catch the sausage" and stories. That was much nicer. Too bad it's not like that any more. Take him as a role model. He should tell you a story. You don't know any stories. Of course I do. Then tell us. You shouldn't speak when you're eating. Well. Told you so. Do you know what the zombie game is based on? No, tell us. Do you know the Danninger lake? The real lake? The story is real, too. - I don't believe you. - I know from Papa. We have a fishing hut there. So go ahead. Back there in the forest, where the fishing hut is now, they used to burn witches at the stake, And those were innocent women. But one of them was a real witch. So how could they burn her? I would have immediately made myself disappear. Because the ones that burned her, had a pact with the devil. That's why they were stronger than her. At every full moon they delivered their victims to the devil. But once they set fire to the real witch. And she started singing, because that made her immortal. The men started screaming, because it burned them from the inside, and tore their hearts apart. They jumped into the Danninger lake and drowned. And at every full moon you can hear the woman sing at the lake. And when she sings, the zombies come out of the swamp. And start crying. I don't believe that story. The regulars say so, too. So let's go to the Danninger lake. But it's not even full moon. So let's go when it is. Fine by me. - Agreed? - Agreed. I want to come, too. Anyone else? Did he tell a nice story? I'll help you clean up. I'll manage on my own. No, that's how my Papa raised me. I know another story. You have to visit my Papa someday. He would be very happy. Put it down there. Thank you. You're welcome, Ms Kramer. Ms Kramer? Can you tell someone off, too? If it's necessary. - Why? - Just asking. Hello there. I am Sebastian Schneider from the Kandler pub. Is that you? You have probably experienced a lot, right? But it won't take much longer. You won't live much longer, will you? My Mama died, too. And you will probably all meet there, so I wanted to... Could you give me a sign please, so I know she is doing well? Maybe you can let our phone ring three times. Let the phone ring three times! Thanks. Do you want to get out? Wow, that is heavy. But we'll manage. Then a girl found it. Look there! Hold on, Ms Kramer! She's doing quite alright, considering what happened to her. - Tomorrow the world will look very different again. - Good. Honestly, she hasn't looked that healthily for a long time. Hail Mary, full of grace, The lord is with you. Blessed are you among women and blessed is the fruit of your womb, Jesus. Pray for us sinners now, and at the hour of death. Amen. When grandma dies, we'll be exactly at 20 years. An even number! All of your Hail Marys won't help you then! Throw him off! Bye. See you tomorrow. So? Slept well? Don't know. Where are the others? They've long gone home. - What's up with you? - Nothing! Why are you always so tired? I've got to go home. And what about your fingers? I've got to go home. Work. - What do you want? - An answer. Or I'll properly tell you off. What about your hands? You can tell someone off? You don't want it any other way. Then I'll have to speak to your father. - What's that for? - What's up? Don't even start. I've got to go home. Have I done anything to you? No. Grandma is feeling better again. Really? I'm telling you. Even the doctor said so. She is full of life again. Now I'm happy. I'd thought I'd killed someone again. Why "again"? The death of your Mom is not your fault. If it wasn't for me, she would still be alive, and Papa would have a wife. That's how it is. And now he can't find any anymore. And it's all my fault. I know, where he can find one! Hello? Mr Schneider? I think there is only one alternative song for countering, and it is the "Leftfeet" and their hit "Clay Pigeons in the Rain", written in 1993, with drums... Why are you talking so much! Was redest du denn so viel! Chatterbox... And now for the impatient listeners: "Clay Pigeons in the Rain". Mr Schneider? Hello? Oh my! I want... I have a strawberry cake... Oops! I just wanted to offer him a cake. Do I have to take off my clothes if I want a slice, too? Are you looking for anything in particular? I'm not looking for anything. And you? I'm bringing a new candle, because the other one disappeared. Probably stolen or so... Would you like a cup of coffee? I need to spare my nerves. - Or tea? Not because of the coffee! I need to go to school because of Sebastian. Oh yes, grandma is doing better again. That's good to hear. Yes, that's nice, right? Now cross your legs, put your fingers like me and close your eyes. Close your eyes. We'll concentrate on the photo. But I can't concentrate on the photo with my eyes closed. Open your eyes. No, close them! I think we'd better call Alfred. Why does Andreas only have this drop in performance with you? I've already told you, and there are also other mothers here... You will need to make an appointment with the school board. Goodbye. Please come in. Radio Universe, this is Alfred. How does it work with the photo, to make someone fall in love? Call again on Wednesday, next time for "Alfreds wish to the Universe". We need to know now. We have already started with the session. Oh kids... Do you have the photos? Yes! Ok, I'll make an exception. Let's try it together. One moment... Please. Nice, that you found the time to come by. - I wanted to talk to you about Sebastian's condition. - Why? Haven't you noticed, that Sebastian has changed a lot? He is unrecognizeable. Do you have the photo in front of you? We still have the right music playing. Then let's give it a go! Hold together your index finger and thumb, breathe in deeply through your nose, and while exhaling, relax and let yourself go. He is completely exhausted. He usually sleeps during the lessons. Maybe it's because of the lessons. - You're funny. I actually think it's because of you. - Why? And when breathing, concentrate on the person on the photo. Breathe in and focus on the person on the photo. Inhale! And concentrate on the person on the photo. Breathe in... How long is your pub open, and how long does Sebastian need to work? An 11-year old cannot work for more than 4 hours. Keep to it! And now wish that the person will fall in love. Send the wish on its trip through the universe. Sebastian works no more than 1 hour! And after that he does his homework for you. Oh, and today he wanted to be excused from homework, Because he needs to be a waiter. And you can see it on his hands. Were you there this afternoon to spy on us? Out now! Immediately, out... And if it didn't work, you didn't concentrate properly. Goodbye. - One moment! - Will it take much longer? Because I'll need to go soon. One moment please. Ok, now we're done. That went really fast now. Do you think it worked, with the photo? Is anything wrong with you? Do you feel like doing anything? Yes... playing the guitar. At first she only had worse grades than last year, but that is normal, isn't it? Sometimes it's better, sometimes worse... But when I found the condoms in her bag... That's a reason to start worrying, isn't it? - Isn't it? - I would definitely recommend private tutoring. - You think so? - Yes. What's up with you? Nothing. Why? I'm in a good mood. Aha, in a good mood. Do you mind? No, it's just unusual. I'm going to bed. I'm exhausted. It's about time. Get lost. I'm not leaving quite yet. Good night. Tomorrow morning, so god's will, you'll be awaken again... But don't wake me up again later. Sleep well. Dream something nice. Good morning, grandma. Good morning, alltogether! Good morning, Mr Behrendts. Today we want to discuss how Abraham sacrifices Isaac. But Evi Kramer isn't here today. For the simple reason, that her great grandmother has died and the Kramer family is in deep mourning. That was your fault. Now we have to use today's lesson, to discuss the topics of death and mourning. How do different religions deal with death and mourning? Toni? Will Sebastian be locked up now? No, of course not. It's not proven, that she died because of the accident, and Sebastian cannot be prosecuted yet, because he is not yet 12 years old, but you will learn that in social sciences. You don't need to be afraid, Sebastian. And if anyone now has a question to the topics of mourning, we will write it down now. Who wrote that there? Has the phone rung three times? What? The phone! That's Evi's great grandmother. Sebastian! So? No, not three times. Now stop it and help me! He has never finished anything, and now he is an architect? Now he is an architect. Why are you putting on a face? - It's all right, Basti. - Don't trouble yourself over old Ms Kramer! - Don't say that! - But it's true! You've done that very well. You've put her out of her misery. Should happen much more often. Clear away all of the empty glasses. - Having you here at the table is really embarassing. - Embarassing? Of course! If someone says his opinion, you have to be embarassed? What kind of a life is that, pumped up on medication? Don't answer! That's Evi's great grandmother. It'll stop in a moment. When she was still alive, nobody stopped by to say hello. Now you can answer. Hello? Hello, here is Lorenz Schneider! Hello. I have a problem. I'd like to see you again. Me too. I am married. I know. So what do we do? I don't know. Nothing. Just meet up. And where? I don't know. It's not that easy. Do you know the Danninger lake? Why are you sneaking up on me? If I had come from the front, I would have had to come through the window. Hello? Hello? Fine, so we're good then. Thanks. Are you eavesdropping? Me? Never! I just wanted to know where you are. Is there anything to eavesdrop on? No... I am sensing vibrations. Not the positive ones though. It's just... Nothing. What would you like to drink? Wine spritzer. Hi there. And you? Evi? Water. Hey, Evi... I agreed with your grandma, that she would ring the phone three times, when she gets to my Mom. You're the first person I'm telling. Sebastian, you are the greatest idiot I know by far. Who put all that crap in your head? Keep your nonsense to yourself! Do you believe, grandma will walk up to a phone booth in heaven or just asks Saint Peter for his mobile phone? Bite me! You see, Evi. Now she is over there. Sebastian, Sebastian... Sebastian... Get up, it's full moon! Come on now, damn! Sebastian, Sebastian... Lad, what shall I do with you? Sebastian, now go on and get up. It's pouring cats and dogs! There you are finally! How many more stones should I have thrown at your window? - I'm soaking wet! - I think it only works, when the moon is in plain view. I forgot to say that. Are you scared? You don't need to be.. Look here, I brought a revolver. Where did you get that? From my dad's cupboard. If it rains like this, the zombies won't come out of the water. There. It's already stopped raining. Did you hear that? The witch! There they are! Now go on and shoot! There, you shoot! You've already killed more people! But... - What was that? - My hand! A zombie that's lost its way, and is shouting. Now come on! Now here we are. Ah, it hurts so much! There's something stuck in your hand! Yeah... Wait, I'll pull it out. If I get blood poisoning and die, I'll file charges against you! Hey, your revolver! Come on, we've got to go. Shit, I've got a flat tire. Oh man! But we've got to get away from here! Why? Yeah, why? Because of the zombies. Zombies? Didn't look like zombies to me. What did they look like then? Well... Like Ms Dorstreiter and your father. What? You're nutty. What would my father and Ms Dorstreiter be doing in a forest at night? This. I think you're a little bit crazy... Are you blind? Didn't you see me? You meant her! But don't you know, that Ms Dorstreiter is married? I can't also kill Alfred. No, Mama, I can't. Now you could reduce the load by a bit! Abraham would have also sacrificed Isaac without hesitation. Otherwise Papa will remain alone forever and I will remain an orphan. This is your chance, Sebastian. There must be a sacrifice. You've already killed others. Go on! Let's go! Death is something beautiful. Sebas... Sebastian... Help me... Sebastian! Sebastian! Help... Help! Call an ambulance! Call an ambulance! An ambulance! Here is Sebastian Schneider. An ambulance please for Alfred, to the station! He's not doing very well. Yes, please! Thank you. Thank you, Sebastian. No, Sebastian! Sebastian, no! Sebastian! Sebastian, stay here! Sebastian, stay here! Birthday... day of death... No, that's not possible... Become immortal... I cannot... Faith, that helps.
