Madame. Madam Curie? Get an ambulance car! Madame? What happened? Hurry, She is very weak! This is Madam Curie? Duclaux? Yes. Are you interested in Microbiology? I am interested in all science that confronts prevailing attitude. I am Pierre Curie. Hello, Mr Curie. Goodbye. You're with company. I have intruded. You have. Now is your opportunity to tell us why you may have intruded mademoiselle Sklodowska. Professor Lippmann! I want to protest in the strongest possible terms! My equipment was moved again last night. There is a simple reason for that. More than simple, it is a distinct lack of respect, by those who share your laboratory with me! Allow me to pose an opposing hypothesis, Ma'am Sklodowska. It might be your equipment takes up too much space. Yes but scientist equipment cannot be kept in a precise position in which it was left.. We are not savages, we are scientist, I couldn't agree more. Then all I need is your assurance.. Ma'am Sklodowska, please leave my laboratory. Leave? We cannot keep you in the manner you require. But I have no where else to go. Then you have to setup a laboratory on your own, Ma'am Sklodowska. I lack the funds. Then your lack of foresight in presenting me, constantly with demands, is something that will teach all of us a valuable lesson. Maybe it's because I am polish? Of cos not. Or because I am not a man? It might be that, but Maria... We are in Paris, I have taken the name Marie. - Your child is crying. - Yes I am aware of that. So shouldn't you assumed some sort of motherly position? - Sorry, madame. - Thank you! What if you were to vist him, apologise. I came all the way from Poland to study Science! I can't apologise science is lost to me! I am going to have to become a teacher! Oh you are impossibly dramatic! Your child is dramatic. Maria... - Apologise. - No, never. I will find my own way. No. Please don't suppose anything by me standing beside you. It's the women from the street with the Duclaux. Hello. I stand beside you, maybe because you look as awkward as I feel, and I made did, Do I seemed awkward? I think correct assumption that we would look less awkward standing together. - I don't feel awkward. - than we might standing apart. Well that's a theory I can support. I am Pierre Curie. You do like your name don't you? That's the second time you have told me. Your Maria Sklodowska. I don't believe I gave you my name? She's wonderful isn't she? The dancer. Her name is Lo?e Fuller. Should you wish to see her again. Do you make it your business to know everybody's name? She calls it this dancer "La Fire dance". Why? I believe it could be she is interested in the way flame moves. Your right, you didn't tell me your name, but I do know it, for three reasons. One, your one of the only 23 female scientists within the department. A prime number. Two, I heard about your run-in with professor Lippmann. That gain you some infamy! and three. I read your paper on the magnetic properties of steel. It contains some exceptional science. Thank you. And you, as if you been so kind I would admit, that I also read your paper on crystalisation. which I enjoyed very much. Thank you. I also heard what Lippmann did, evicting you from your lab. I am sorry. I don't need pity, Mr Curie. - But if I could be of any assistance... - I would be fine. Just to be clear, I refuse to be grateful for a scientist to offer another scientist a room. I am more than capable, and my work.. Your ingratitude is entirely correct. Also, I think it's worth pointing out that I will not be a mistress. That thought hasn't occured to me. I won't tolerate meddling. I will not be taught how my experiments to be optimised.. Well I enjoy sharing science, and I think by working together.. I will not tolerate it. Well your going to have to learn to tolerate it. I like collaboration. I will take an interest in your work And I will be interested if you taken an interest in mine. Ma'am Sklodowska! Before you turn your back on the only room, anyone is offering you. Would you at least see what I work? Basic. Marcel, Andr?, Maurice, Paul May I introduce Ma'am Marie Sklodowska. Such a pleasure to meet you, Ma'am Sklodowska. - We heard so much about you. - You have? The academy probably dislike me almost as much as they dislike you. I have been passed over for every major advancements, professorship, funding. Why? I am not entirely sure, maybe I bore them, maybe I scare them. But they do me not great favour either. But your a scientist to some renowed. Well I am asking you to share my renowed, yet basic space with me. Why are you asking? I have an instinct about you. An instinct is not particularly a scientific reason. Nor if it's still a reason. Yes. Yes, this will suit my needs entirely. Good. - You have been frowning at that all week. - I am observing. - What are you looking for? - I find it easier to observe when I am not talking. I measure uraninum and I discover less radiation than I do in its ore. The ore is more powerful than the element? Exactly. - And I can't be... - There some be some anamoly in the results. I run the same test six times, I get identical results. My instinct is that there is another element that is skewing the results. You think you found an undiscovered element? - If your laughing at me.. - No I am not laughing at you. That's exciting. - Your measuring equipment is useless. - It's worked perfectly fine for me. If we are going to get the figures you need, we something that is capable of extreme precision. There is no "we". You need something that is capable of measuring microscopic aspects.. - No please, no no no! - I have an idea. Follow me. Mr. Curie. Sorry, I know it's some distance. The length of our journey doesn't agitate me, Mr Curie. The distination does. This is one of the finest hospital in Paris, there is a piece of equipment.. I chose not to go into hospital. But your a scientist! Maria... Are you frightened? Of what? Of my illness. No. Good. Cause there is no reason to be frightened. Will you die? But if you cure me. How can I cure you? You can kiss me. If you kiss me again, I promise I won't die. But brunie says... Your sister doesn't know everything. Kiss me. Did you feel that? No. That was the sound of the world turning in a new direction. The Maria Sklodowska direction. I can't feel it. Kiss me again. Now, can you feel it? Yes. I think I did. You cured me. Sorry, that took longer than I thought. Are you feeling better? I decided, my experiments can cope perfectly well without your equipment. When you were working with crystals, you need to be able to measure microscopic amounts of charge, and nothing works. Until I build this. It's a quadrant electrometer. It's capable of measuring, precisely, the tiny amounts of electrical charge in a material. It measures electrical potential? Your equipment isn't good enough. Mine is. Your science is brillant. So is mine. Your proposing a partnership? That's exactly what I am doing. Well basically, it's just a question of dissolving. My husband is looking at me disapprovingly again. I am doing nothing of that sort. You think I am asking stupid questions to your eminent friends. The questions aren't stupid, really. My mother told me: "Never marry a brillant man." You will disappoint them, and they will disappoint you. And why would I disappoint you? By failing to avoid making her feel inadequate I would suspect. This one I can say. No I will clear, your asking the questions. So you, take the, ore, and you dissolve into it. Well, we take the pitchblend, which is a special ore, that comes all the way from a mine in Bohemia, and then we use a scientific process to, remove the elements we know we can remove, and look at what's left. And what scientific processes might you use? These are very good questions. We crush it. Which is extremely hard work. Then we boil it, Which results in the removal of substances. We add, acidic and alkaline solutions to it. Until only that which is pure remains. And there is alot of substance to remove. And it would be worth it. It's very exciting! And why are you looking at Uranium in the first place? - Becquerel. - One of the more competent scientist. Becquerel discovered accidentally that uranium salts wrapped in a black cloth, left in a drawer, left an impression on a photographic plate. And he thought that the Uranium is having an unusual chemical reaction with something in the atmosphere. I say, it's the element itself. - A very radical thought. - I still don't understand. Imagine a grape. How do you turn a grape into wine? Well you crush it and ferment it. Yes, so imagine a grape crushes itself, ferments itself, changes it's very being. And what if I told you that, as the grape turns itself into wine, it releases a powerful surge of energy, power that can make things happen. You will be excited, am I right? I think so, yes I would. So science is changing. And the very people who are running science, are the people who believe, that the world is flat, and I am going to prove them wrong. Just as Newton did. - We are. - Thank you. I see the way you look at me Pierre. How do I look at you? Like a fermenting grape? - I enjoyed that analogy. - That was a good analogy. But your right. I do look at you in a certain way. And sometimes.. I have the feeling you look at me the same way back. When my mother died, I couldn't speak for a week. And people thought it was grieve. It wasn't. It was that I simply couldn't comprehend, why something so important had been taken from me. I have been selfish my entire life Pierre, and if you have to change that.. Your not selfish. Your just.. self-absorbed. And you don't like anyone to take what's yours. I will never be the women nor the wife you want me to be. You laugh at me. I have presumptuous. I know, we hardly know each other. I am laughing because, you denied me the chance to propose to you. Oh yes I have. Hadn't I? Well as a matter of scientific interest, was proposing even your intention? Well as a matter of scientific interest, the thought was fully formed in my head yet. As you said, we hardly know each other. But yes, I suspect it was. Marie Sklodowska. You are better than any women that I could have hoped for. And I would never consider you my women. I would like to share my life with you. Thank you every much. This way please. Don't move. Remind me whenever I forget, that we should leave Paris. As often as humanly possible. We shoud experience all the world it has to offer. Remind me, to retrain you out of that glorious need to overstate everything. I thought I was finish with women. What? From what you told me, you barely started with. I mean, I thought I just wanted to concentrate on science. You do love these pompous phrases don't you? Are you turning around. I think you drugged me into compliance. I did no such thing! Your just extraordinary. This is entirely ridiculous. I am carrying you over the threshold. Your not, you're blindfolding me over the threshold, which requires far lesser on your part than mine. The academy has, in honor of our wedding. And because they are excited by our work? decided to furbish us with new lodgings in which to deal with, the pitchblend at our disposal. - Then why do I need to be blindfolded? - More exciting. Ready? Hello, Paul. Welcome to Versailles. - This.. - Not quite what we wished for. It's a lean to. Wait till you see inside. This is.. Isn't it? They have outdone themselves. They have. Hello. I have an order. Marie Sklodowska? It's Marie Curie now, but this is the right place. - I will put it in the yard, shall I. - Thanks. Is it the Pitchblend? - Careful. - I am careful. Again. Ir?ne? Ir?ne. Yes. Here. Shhh, Paul. That's Radium. Radium? A pink prick of radium. Gathered from 4 tons of pitchblende. There is more to find. Isn't it the most beautiful thing you have ever seen? And you're sure? You're sure of it? I am certain. Yes. It is the most beautiful thing I have ever seen. Well, I guess everything changes now does it? Yes. We thought we would find a new element. We were wrong. It's taken 4 years, 4 tons of pitchblend, 40 tons of corrosive chemicals, and 400 tons of water. We are here to present to you, 2 new elements. Polonium, and Radium. We all thought that atoms were finite and stable. Well, it turns out some of them are not. And in their instability, they emit rays. I have called this, radioactivity. We are here to tell you that you have fundamentally, misunderstood the atom. Look here! Lady or a man? A lady obviously. Hello. Have you ordered? Champagne! - Why? - I got it. - You got it? What? - I am a professor. - You are? - I am! Finally they realised there is something to us. Be careful. Why? - No. - Yes. I am professor Curie and I am going to have 2 children. Congratulations, Professor Curie. Where are we going? I am taking you somewhere, I think you are going to like. But I am tired, I am pregnant. and it's freezing. Lo?e Fuller has invited us to a seance. Lo?e Fuller? Spiritualism? Oh you cannot be serious. It is science, like any other. Don't talk such rot. There is nothing to see or analyse. You can't see radioactivity. That is completely different. Good evening, Lo?e. We live in world, where invisible light, can pass through flesh, and exposed the bones beneath it. Using "X" gazes, I will call out, the presence of Beethoven, as it becomes clear to me. "X" gazes? - As in uranium Rays? - Yes. In a little while, the portrait, of Beethoven, will appear, on this photographic plate. And now Beethoven is going to come back from the dead. She is using our science to further her work. All scientists work on previous works. You call this science? This could change science forever. Do you not understand, we already change science forever. That's stronger on the other. This is definitely more refined. We had another submission. What do they want? Radioactive smelling salts. As a cure for baldness. What did you say? "We don't own Radium, we don't have a patent and you are free to do as you will with it." If we did had a patent, we would have a bigger laboratory. I know the possibility of science... If we hand it to them, then people won't be able to enjoy the possibilities. But it's trusting others to see the possibility, that I am not sure of. Oh people can see the possibilities, believe me. Radioactive matches. Radioactive cigarettes. Radioactive chocolate. Radioactive toothpaste. There is a letter in here. Radioactive beauty powder. Lo?e Fuller wants a radioactive jacket for her dance. Don't worry, I told her we don't make jackets. Have you heard a dance craze in Broadway, based on our work? The "Piff, Paff, Pouf" ! What have we done? What's that? That's nothing. Henri Danlos, the dermatologist came to me the other day, very excited. He put some radium chloride on a tumor. And it showed but considerably shrinkage. Shrinkage? Two thousand years, cancer, the incurable illness. Can you imagine? They are starting a study group. He thinks our radium can cure cancer? Danlos is just the start. I can feel our work glowing out. I can feel it changing the world. Mr Warner? I am doctor Jenkins. And you, must be Peter. Hello. Do you know who this guy is? This guy, he is the doctor, he is going to make you a lot better. And then you know what, we are all going to go home. We are going to use what it's called a linear accelerator. Linear what? It's at the forefront of science, Mr Warner. But you have used one before? In this hospital, your son will be the first to use it. Around the world, it's the fifth machine of it's kind. My child is not a monkey for your research. Unless we find a way to make peter better, this cancer will grow, and it will infiltrate all his major organs. This machine will shrink his tumor, I guarantee it. Will it shrink it enough? I can't say. But it will substantially improve your child chance to survival. I want to see it. Of cos you do. It's bigger than I expected. It's a machine with an incredible amount of power inside it. It's needs to be big. Wait, he is going to be inside it? No. He will be strapped in here. He will be strapped? It's just so he doesn't move. We need to be very precise as we use rays. Will he be in pain? M. Warner, this machine will improve your son's life. It may even save it. Stay still, son. Bad news, is it bad news? No, it's not bad news, it's going well. It worked? You mean he is better? It's a long road, Mr Warner, but we got off to a good start. Would you like to see him? I swear, this is the last time I come here. Just wait and see. She needs silence for the inter-plasma to appear. What? - Is the radium hurting you? - No I took it off. It did prove to hit the flesh, turned it gray. Look. There is a lesion. It's fascinating. She is a complete fraud. And they have formed some sort of mysterious friendship. He has promised to weight her, before during and after the sessions, to see if there really is a spirit, that's really coming in. I think you are jealous. I am not jealous. I am outraged, because I think he should take what we do far more seriously. Oh heavens.. Come, he recognise me. We are on the front of the newspaper. He will recognise me. People can't believe that I am the sister of the famous Madam Curie. Fame is for idiots. And look it seems to give Pierre, some very strange ideas. Well, allow him to be strange. Enjoy his enjoyment. What? Spiritualism? Faith isn't such a bad thing. I have faith, I have faith in humanity, I have faith in progress. But faith in the afterlife has no scientific foundation whatsoever. You never think that mother might be.. somewhere better than this? I do. In a hole, in the ground, in Poland. A place far superior to Paris. Maria, you are so cynical. No, my dear just realistic. Who are you writing to? They want to give me the legion of Honor. So I am responding. What's your response? I have asked them to thank the minister, but I do not feel the need to be decorated at all. And you are, have the greatest need for a better laboratory. You're coughing a lot. Have I? Marie. Don't take me to a hospital, I won't go to a hospital. Wait here. Forceps, please. Now, I need you to push. - I can't. - Just breathe. I thought we lost her. The famous Marie Curie needed help, and everyone came running. She should have died. But they saved her. And you. ?ve. Ir?ne. What are you thinking about? I don't know. You're not thinking about anything? I don't know. You must always be thinking about something. What are you thinking about? Think you are too young to understand. Our work has been nominated for the Nobel prize. For our discovery of radioactivity. The commendation, only mentions my name. And.. And? And I told them if there is a Nobel prize to win, we win it together. Oh Paul, I need a chair. What time is it? Ten after twelve. What time is it in Sweden? Ten after twelve. Are you sure this is where you want to be? Seems, seems the right place. Are you ready, Mr Curie? No. It can be thought, that Radium may become very dangerous, in criminal hands. This is Colonel Tibbets, on the Enola Gay. Do you receive, Washington, over? Receiving, Colonel Tibbets. Over. Washington, Captain Robert Lewis just informed me Little Boy is now live. Permission to drop, over. Permission granted, Colonel. Over. Here, the question can be raised, whether mankind benefits from knowing the secrets of nature, whether it is ready to profit from them, or whether this knowledge will not be harmful to it. On my mark, three, two, one. The example of the discoveries of Nobel it's characteristics. This high power explosives have enabled man, to perform wonderful work. They are also a terrrible mean of destruction, in the hands of great criminals, would led the people towards war. I am one of those who believed, with Nobel, that mankind will derive more good than harm, from these new discoveries. Your back! I am. And was it everything you hoped it would be? Yes. Did you get all the acclamation you felt you deserve? My speech was entirely about you and your work. But I am just the wife, isn't that right? - When have I ever treated you.. - I am the wife of Pierre Curie. You said you didn't care about professional accomplishments, you only cared about achievements. I was the one who fought... And I am doing what a wife should do, giving you children, keeping your home. You should get out of Paris, paris pollutes us both. How dare you, how dare you take my brilliance, how dare you, take that applause. We should get out and get some air. "I am one of those, who believed with Nobel" No, no i made it clear. - "that mankind derives more.." - I made it absolutely clear! You stole my brilliance, you should have never gone without me! You just given birth. You were too ill to travel, and you didn't even want to go! What was I supposed to do? This is bigger than both of us, Marie! And someone had to be there to represent the achievement! You never did understand, you were angry because they didn't want you as one of their own. Oh you fathom me so well. I was angry, because they were wrong. But I never wanted any of this, I just want to do good science. And did I made you a better scientist? Are we not better scientist together? Of course we are. Because you have one of the finest mind I have ever met, but just so happen that my mind is finer. Your main problem Marie, is your arrogance. My main problem, is you. and the fact that I love you so utterly. It's not that I don't understand what is between us. Is because I don't understand what my life was without you. Even when I think of myself as a boy, somehow you were there. I wished you would have been in Sweden with me. I wish we could have been together. I am sick, Marie. I am sick. When I cough, it's blood. Let's get out of Paris, and rest and get better. What about the lab? That can wait. - Let's save us. - There is too much to do. Please, Marie, Please. Pierre, don't go too far! Maria! Where are you? Watch out! Hello, my friend. Hello. Good, and do we have copies of that? Welcome Madam Curie. I do not know why I am here. Your here, because the panel would like to consider you for professor Curie position at the university. You wish to give me Pierre's seat? We don't want to give you anything. We are interviewing a number of candidates and we thought due consideration should be given to you taking the post. And if I don't want the post? Then that is one less candidate for us to consider. I wish to be considered on my own merits. If you wish to give me out of pity, don't. If you wish to give me to follow some agenda or other, don't. - Well, what say you... - I have nothing else to say. It is not that job I want, but it is a job I will take. And if my science doesn't speak for itself, with regards to my quality. then you have gravely misunderstood my science. I apologise, gentleman. Characteristic behaviour I am afraid. It's an achievement, Marie. First female professor at the Sorbonne? A promotion well overdue for France and the world first female Nobel prize winner. Nobel prize? You do remember I wasn't even nominated. It was Pierre who fought for me, who fought for our work to be recognised. Without him, I never would have won. His everything to me, and now he is gone. And I am... I am lost. This would pass, Marie. No it won't. - You are being very strong. - I am bored of strong. I don't want to be strong, I want to be weak. Well Pierre wouldn't want that. You think you could talk for him? I miss him too. I want to tell you about Radium. A most perculiar and, remarkable element because, It does not behave as it should. We call this place "The doomed town". Seems like an extraordinary amount of work. The dummies are dressed by J.C Penney. Better dressed than the boys. The thing is, need to be this precise? Pretty cool huh? Sorry everyone. - It's no problem. - I don't apologise. Glasses. There are those that say my radium is make him sick. Are you sick? No. You? Yes. Anemia. But there is no proof, there is no proof.. There are those that say that it might be the thing that weakened my Pierre, that made him unable to roll out of the way. Pierre's skull was crushed. He was.. Radium wouldn't have caused that. I can't do anything without him. - He want you to. - I know. It's expected of you. I expected of you too. You are the best women, I have ever met. Best person. I know what you have lost, Marie. Pierre once said to me that, he couldn't imagined a life without me. And I never said anything back. And I should have. Do you need feeding? No? Then run along then. Radioactivity, is the spontaneous emission, of radiation or particles from the decay of nuclei which due to a perculiar arrangement of their internal structure are far more unstable. Refers to particles which are emitted from Nuclei as a result of, nuclear instability. That's all, thank you. It's not as bad as it sounds. - Do we know who are involved? - There are two. Marcel Demalander and Maurice D?m?nitroux. They are preparing Thorium X. Thorium X, for who? Some factory outside of Paris. - Maurice have been off for quite sometime. - With what? - Leukimia. - And Marcel? He has anemia. Severe anemia. - And there is a direct link? - Of cos there is a direct link. These are radiations and complications. These cases are appearing with greater and greater regularity. We were never unaware. And now we need to be more aware. Lost your husband, so you take mine. The great Marie Curie. Reduced to a thief. No. Your not Marie Curie. You don't even deserve that name. Your name, is Maria Sklodowska and you are polish. The dirty Pol. The dirty Pol that invented a poison. That the world thought marvellous! But I know what you are! I heard her. And yet you stayed inside. If you wanted me to join you out there, I would if I. The logical thing was to stay inside, so I stayed inside. I am sorry she said those things. Don't be. Marie. What? What do we do now? 4 pages in this piece of nationalist rubbish. His wife hired a private detective. They stole our letters. She gave them to the papers, and encourage them to print them, it was little little bits of advice I gave him, mainly on denying her pleasure. The paper seem outraged by the idea that women, might have pleasure in their lives. But this intimate pleasures.. - Your talking here.. - Of sex, yes. I have shocked you. And everyone else. You haven't shocked me. You just shouldn't be writing about these things that, Intimate. And not to be written of. People are looking. They always looked. Not like this, not with hate. Get out of France you filthy immigrant! Marie, may I have a word? Can't it wait? No. She's told me that if I go home, this will all be over. I am not entirely convinced, but this will never be over. I don't want it to hurt you anymore. I think the damage to me is probably permanent, whatever you persuade her to do. Marie, you said you will never love me. Pierre, wouldn't want.. I would say it's a mistake to cite his name in this conversation, wouldn't you? You are not abandoning me. I am not a lost dog. You are just leaving me to find my own way. Now go, be valiant. Just don't ask me to pity you, as you do so. They closed it. She died. So they closed it. I never thought this place, I never thought.. What she did had any merit. You're a scientist. She was an artist. Or a something. I don't know quite what she was. She died? Lo?e, will you help me? I didn't understand this place, and you did, and I... Can you do what she did? I like you to make my husband appear. I don't think even she promise that. Please will you make my husband appear? Please will you make my husband appear? Please will you make my husband appear? Come on! Go Go! Straight ahead. So he is leaving you? He was... not strong enough. Certainly not strong enough for the press. These so-called nationalist calling you a dirty pol, a dirty Jew. I tired to tell them I am a dirty Catholic, and a dirty.. They won't listen. Maria. I am going home. To poland. - Will you come with me? - I belong here. But they don't think so. France is Ir?ne and ?ve's home. Ir?ne and ?ve would love Poland. My work is here. Poland has changed. You will be venerated, celebrated. Pierre is buried here. They stand outside your house, screaming for you to leave. What have other people's opinion ever affected anything I have done? Go home! Your growth is slowing, ?ve. Is it? And Ir?ne is growing faster than ever. Well, I have big teeth. So you do. Telegram, madame. Interesting? The Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences has seen fit to. I have been awarded, the nobel prize again. This time for chemistry. For what? For my extraction of the elements, Radium and Polonium. Congratulations, mother. And they suggested that I do not come, to avoid unncessary controversy. Well. Let me measure your head, ?ve. Come here, sweetie. We were so pleased you were able to make it to Sweden, Mrs Curie. Were you? Oh yes. The women's movement in stockholm, supported you with great strength and conviction. Have you all that you need? Yes, I have. Everything I need. They don't like you here. Nonsense! They are merely having a hard time seperating, my scientific life, from my personal life. Why don't they like your personal life? What will you talk of in your speech? Personal things? No. The chemistry of the imponderable. Some 15 years ago, The radiation of Uraninum was discovered by Henri Becquerel. and 2 years later, the study of this phenomenon, was extented to other substances. First by me, and then by Pierre Curie. and myself. The study rapidly led us to the discovery of new elements the radiation of which, while being analogous to that of uranium, was far more intense. Thanks to this discovery of new very powerful radioactive substances The study of radioactivity progresses with marvellous rapidity. Ir?ne, where are you taking me? Wait and see mama. Stop here driver. - Ir?ne, I won't... - I know. - Then why am I here? - Cause you need to see it. Do you think the warriors are seperate to you? Of cos it is. You think you can't help? Irene, I am ill, I am female. I can't see myself being much useful to anyone. But give me a gun and I will try. This country is at war, and the medical services are a disaster. I won't go inside your hospital. I know, mother. So I am bringing it outside to you. This is Frank. Hello, Frank. He has both his legs amputated. This is Pascal. Hello, Pascal. He has both his arms amputated. And this is Gabriel. Ir?ne. I want to look at them like exhibits in a museum. They are chopping these boys up. They don't have absurdities to do otherwise. It's tragic. What do you want me to do about it? You're Marie Curie. It's time to make this war your war. Please. As senior science minister in the government, I must tell you. Young boys are dying. As senior scientist minister. Science. Science minister. My apologies. Senior science minister. I see your sense of superiority, you take with you. Professor Lippmann, you have never liked me. It's not a question of liking or disliking. Quite, it's a question of respect, and you have respect me. Now, with the mobile radiography unit, we can be x-raying troops, before deciding whether they need amputation, surely you can see. Madam Curie, all I can see is, impractical measure proposed by a women I know to be eminently practical. I need funds, I need access, I need the ability, to go out on the battlefield, you must grant me. Why must I do that? Partly because it is right, partly because I am needed. But mostly, mostly because I am sick, and tired, I cough blood most night. and this is my last fight. And I will win it. We are both tired, Madam Curie. Mother, if you can look at him like he hasn't done your personal front I greatly appreciate it. - I don't mind. - Of cos you do. Because you won't say, your well mannered. But mother isn't so fierce, that she can't adjust her behaviour. - You have a PhD? - This isn't a job interview. Do you have a PhD? Shut up, ?ve ! I do, I do have a PhD. - And your thesis was on? - Mother! Mr Joliot, do you have interesting observation to make about the weather, about the political system, about the transport system? No. Do you love science? Of cos I love science. I love your daughter, and I love science. He loves your daughter. Let us take your love for my daughter as read, and talk of science. I would love to. You are impossible. So tell me what you have been working on, Mr Joliot? I have been working with Ir?ne actually. We have been working with the belief that maybe radioactivity, can be taken a few steps further. Can it now? Carry on. In those atoms where radioactivity doesn't naturally occur, maybe it can be induced. What have you been working with? Lighter elements, Boron and Aluminum. We are bombarding them with alpha particles, and getting readings after we stopped. If we can show the reaction.. Then you would have shown the possibility of artificial radiation. This is exciting work. I think so too. You think we like him? I will get those ambulances. And I will outfit them, and I will get them ready. But I won't work on them. And I don't want you to either. Death is not good for a young person to see. And I don't think you should be involved with Frederic's work. As exciting as it seems, radiation is not safe. And, in fact I want you to stay away from him. But you spend your entire life.. life surrounded by death in radiation yes, and they brought me very little happiness. I want better for you. Night night. Madam Curie. Mademoiselle Curie. What an honour to see you, to grace me with your presence. Your exploits are a credit to France, Madam. We are here to ask for funds. Ah yes, Professeur Lippmann has explained to me in your situation. I am afraid, your request for funds cannot be granted. Consider these as part payment. Melt them down and use them for war effort. - But these are your Nobel prizes. - And they are made from pure gold. It is a start don't you think? Madam Curie, these prizes are a pride of France, I will not.. These prizes are the results of pain, and they seem to have caused pain and I would rather they be use for something useful like curing others from pain. Well I think.. Boys are having their legs sawn off, because of sprained ankles. My X-ray machines properly installed can save lives. We will also use Radon radiation to cauterize wounds, that is quick, efficient, and can stop blood loss. Our proposal, will give you more men on your battlefield. But Radon is a gas, Madam Curie. I am perfectly aware of that. And that's why we will use bulbs. Radon bulbs. The minister of war has made his position clear. Then let me make mine clear. I will go to the press. I will offer them my Nobel prize metal. I will give them the same ultimatum. - The press? - I know perfectly well what the press is capable of. And I believe I have learnt how to use it to my advantage. Now, will you please give me my X-rays machines and ambulances? Your quite the competent driver. Who taught you? I learnt. I wasn't much of a mother was I? What does that have to do with anything right now? I am very proud of you. Thank you. I am very proud of you too. Must have been so difficult. Being a women and doing all that you did. Believe my love, I suffered much more from, lack of resources and funds, than I ever did from being a woman. Now, are you still working with Frederic, on his artificial radiation theory? It's not his theory. It's ours. And of cos I am still working with Frederic. Now, can we concentrate on the matter at hand. Absolutely. Mum. Help me with this, it's very heavy. Now if you check the bulb. Be careful, it's delicate. There's been a fire, we need everyone, quickly now. We are just outfitting this, unload. You don't understand we need everyone, get in the van. Help. Mother, the time is come. A red ribbon for him? We have to make rational decisions about who we can save. They say they can't save him. What do you think? What? Irene, your only 18 years old, but you are the most capable doctor here, What do you think? I think we should take him to the hospital. Maria... Are you frightened? Water. Sorry? Would you like some water? I hate hospitals. I know. I had to say goodbye to my mother in a hospital. I know. So I plan a way of making people better from outside of the hospital. You did. I did, didn't I? Didn't I? I think we should leave here, don't you? No, there is too much to do. Let us stop by leaving the hospital. I used to have such beautiful hands. Now the radiation has crippled your bones. The things that makes us weak, is the things that makes us strong. - I didn't make you weak. - Of cos you did. But I couldn't have done what we couldn't what we did without each other. No, you did the extraordinary. You changed the world. In the right way. I rather be someone that hopes the world be full of light, and fills the darkness out there, wouldn't you? You throw stones down in the water, the ripples you can't control. There are things to be scared of but, there is so much to celebrate. I hope you're right. I hope you're right.
