[SOMBER MUSIC PLAYING] - [THUDDING] - [MAN GROANS] [MAN GRUNTS] - [SMACKING] - [MAN GROANS] [SLAPPING] [MAN GROANS] WOMAN: No, no, no! [SOMBER MUSIC PLAYING] MAN ON PHONE: No, no, it's... it's not gonna work. WOMAN: How do you know that? We've not even tried it. MAN ON PHONE: Because you're just, you're just saying that for the sake of fixing this. This... [SIGHS] Whatever this is. WOMAN: Whatever this is? Wow. MAN ON PHONE: Well, it's, it's not really a relationship, Grace, when I'm the only one making the effort, is it? I mean... [SCOFFS] I had to call you, like, three times this week just to get through to you. How many times do I have to tell you... MAN ON PHONE: You're busy doing the work. Yeah, I know, I know. But, you know, what's... what's wrong with texting? You know, you could at least text me. This, this entire month, I felt like you, you didn't even exist. I warned you. I warned you at the beginning that this wasn't gonna be easy because of the long distance. MAN ON PHONE: And you know what? I guess I was wrong, because I thought that we would be okay without the physical part. Oh. So it's a physical thing now? No, no, it's everything, Grace. It's everything. You just... You don't get it. No, I get it. You haven't had sex for a few months, and now everything's falling apart. You're starting to sound delusional. You know that? Okay, then help me. Help me to see a future in this relationship. I seriously... I don't even know why we're arguing. Because, Grace, I am trying my absolute hardest not to break up with you right now. Okay. I am trying. I really, really am. But you know what? At the end of the day, I don't get to see you. We never speak to each other. What's the point? Love. Love. Sure. [SIGHS] Do you love me, Grace? I do. I do too, you know. But... [EXHALES] That's the problem. - What? - We're not in love anymore, Grace. Are we? [TEARFULLY] I don't know. I can't do this. Hmm. Chris... - [EXHALES] - Chris... You either... You either fly over tomorrow or this relationship, it's over for me. That's not fair. You have to give me more time. Goodbye, Grace. Have a nice life. [HANGS UP] [PIANO MUSIC PLAYING] [EXHALING] [TIRES SCREECH] Oi! What the fuck do you think you're doing? I'm sorry. - You just nearly ran me over. - I'm sorry. I'm sorry. - I'm sorry. - Oh. You were on your phone, were ya? [STUTTERS] Look, I'm distracted. - Oh, yeah. - I'm sorry. I know. - You're all right? - Keep your eyes on the road. Yeah? You fucking idiot. [PANTING] Oh, fuck. Come on, come on. Pick up, pick up, pick up. [SIGHS] [ENGINE STARTS] [WOEFUL MUSIC PLAYING] [CLEARS THROAT] Hey. David, right? Hello, Grace. Do you know if anyone's in? I saw Ed and Liv walk the dog this morning. Oh. Really? It's bad. What's bad, David? Hello? [SUSPENSEFUL MUSIC PLAYING] Hello? - Ed? - [LOW THUDDING] [SUSPENSEFUL MUSIC CONTINUES] Anyone in? [DOG BARKS] Oh, hey, Polly, little cutie. Hello? LIV: Grace? Is that you? - Yeah. - LIV: I'll be right down. Okay. Hey. - Surprise! [CHUCKLES] - Gracie. Oh, my God, it's been such a long time. Wait. It's Ed's birthday, right? Oh, have I got the date wrong? No. Yeah. Yeah, it is. Babe, look who's here. Oh, Barbara, you don't have to iron those. I'll do them. It's nearly done anyway. I said I'll do them. Okay. [CHUCKLES] Well, I'm off then. - GRACE: Have a good weekend. - LIV: Yeah, see ya. Grace, what are you doing here? To celebrate your birthday obviously. Oh, you know, I don't really like to celebrate my birthdays. Oh. Shut up. [CHUCKLES] It's a good excuse to get drunk at least. Tea? Yeah, sure. So how did you know I was gonna be here? Where else are you gonna be? You two are practically married. [CHUCKLES] Oh, now you're here we might as well have a party. Just like the old times, eh? Well, you better watch out for this one then. You know what she's like when she's had a few. I'll be on my best behavior. [SCOFFS] We'll see about that. Do you guys know what's up with David? What do you mean? He said something weird to me earlier. Oh. You know he's a weirdo. Yeah. I saw him the other day. He was eating flowers and he just kept chewing them. - Hmm. - [SIGHS WEARILY] Do you know what I think? I think he's got a great life. I mean, he doesn't work, gets benefits from the government and he lives with mum. Scot-free. Oh, and what? We live such a miserable life, do we? I mean, you're not doing too bad yourself, Ed. Look at this place. And a beautiful girlfriend who you stole away from me. You can take Polly with you anytime. LIV: Hey. Here. To make your life even worse, Ed. I got you something. You shouldn't have. Come on, open it. Wow. You know you're getting old when you start getting cigars for your birthday. God. They smell expensive, babe. Apparently, they're the exact same brand that was used during Bill Clinton's presidency. Really? No way. Thanks. Welcome. Happy birthday. Will you be staying tonight? Nah, I don't wanna intrude. Uh, we're going to see my family, remember? - GRACE: Oh. - I don't remember. Yeah, we spoke about it last week. Well, plans can change. Can't they, babe? - I mean... - Oh, you're staying. So how's your new job? Oh, you got a new job? Yeah. It's not exactly new anymore. Something to do with toxicology. Forensic scientist. Interesting choice for a girl, isn't it? - Not really. - Just asking. Actually, I'm just a junior. LIV: You know, I find it so fascinating. You must have witnessed some horrendous crime scenes. Not all forensic scientists get involved in crime scene work. Some choose to stay in the lab. Babe, I just realized. You're a lawyer, so the two of you could work together on a case. I suppose we could. Maybe we already have. I mean, obviously, we can't talk about it. It's all confidential, legally binding. Right. I was just prepping dinner. Are you hungry, Grace? You know I can always eat. Great. I'll let you two catch up. Give me a kiss, babe. - [CHUCKLING] - Oh. How many hugs do you want off me? Oh. I've just missed you so much. So, how's you and Chris? Yeah. We're fine. - Good. - Hm. [WHIMPERING] [INDISTINCT CONVERSATION] LIV: So, how long has he been away? - GRACE: Three months... - Months? [PHONE VIBRATING] Hey, Lucas. LUCAS ON PHONE: Ed, happy birthday, man. Thanks. LUCAS: Remember, you're only as old as the woman you feel. [BOTH LAUGHING] [LUCAS EXHALES] Are you ready to come back to work yet? Yeah, soon. Soon. How is the Cardona case going? Well, all the signs are there, but the police are blind as bats and the public are all swayed by the celebrity. You know, same old drill. [SIGHS] I'm doing the best I can. But I ain't no Edward Newman. [ED SCOFFS] Anyway, trial starts next week. That soon? Yeah, look, don't feel like you need to rush back. You and Liv okay? Ed? - Ed? - Uh, yeah. Yeah. Look, I'll give you a call before the trial starts. Yeah, okay. Sure, man. GRACE: Yeah, I guess so. But how about you in the countryside? - Oh. Great. - [CHUCKLES] We went hiking last weekend. Oh, my gosh. You would not believe the view from the top of the mountain. I can get my phone and show you some of the pictures. Okay. [RUSTLING] Ed? [SUSPENSEFUL MUSIC PLAYING] [TALKING INDISTINCTLY IN THE DISTANCE] [LAUGHING] Grace, get in. [LAUGHING] I think it's time for Grace to meet Polly. - Yes. - Who's Polly? - Polly, come on, girl. - [DOG BARKS] Oh, my God. You have a dog. She's so cute. Isn't she just? Didn't you say she was adopted, though? Yeah, well, family dog. Mom got her from a rescue center. She works long hours now and couldn't take care of her. So, she dropped her off here and she's been here ever since. Check this. [GRACE EXCLAIMS IN AMUSEMENT] [LAUGHING] Aw. So, how did you two meet? She didn't tell you? I thought that's the first thing you girls would talk about. I was too embarrassed to say. Why? - Swipe, swipe, swipe. - Ed. How very old-fashioned of you. Hey, look, dating apps are great. Don't knock them off. I've got friends who got married from them, you know. Can't say I've ever used them. Well, maybe you should give it a go. Once you get past all the dick pics and the hook-ups... What he's trying to say is that nice guys like him are hard to find. Right. So, who messaged first? - I did. - Pretty sure it was me. Um, I sent a smiley face. You sent a winky emoji and they don't count. Anyway, he was telling me about this book he was reading. Something like Anna, Anna Karen? - Anna Karenina. - Yeah. That's it. Oh. I love that book. Wasn't it written by a Russian author, uh, Tolstoy? Yeah. Leo Tolstoy. Well, I had no idea. So I just said, "Cool." And he kept showing off. And then I just thought, "Mmm, this guy's just not for me." - You got bored of him? - Yes, but he kept on going. And then, well, I started to realize there's something quite appealing about him. And I asked her out. I said no at first. Uh, she was playing hard to get, you know. But eventually he started to make me laugh and being all charming. So we met and here we are. [CHUCKLES] Come on, let me show you to your room. LIV: Hello? Grace! - Yeah. - Hiking photos. GRACE: You picked up the chair and just threw her out the window? [BOTH LAUGHING] [THUNDER RUMBLING] LIV: It's so crazy, right? GRACE: I can't believe he didn't get fired for that. ED: Are you still horse riding, Grace? Oh, babe, you used to really enjoy that, no? Yeah, I just, uh, I couldn't afford it. Since I moved into my own flat. Oh, that's a shame. Can you keep the horse in the flat? Ed, stop being silly. I mean, plus, I felt really bad for the horses. ED: What do you mean? Well, before we came along, they were wild and free and then look what we made them do. And they get whipped around by all these jockeys. What if we were put on this planet to be their riders? Maybe that's their purpose. GRACE: Okay. They might even like it for all we know. Okay, Ed, let me... Let me set the scene for you. So... So you're in the middle of this... this huge field, and... and you walk a few meters ahead. And then there's this... this wooden fence in front of you. And then you look behind you and to the sides of you, and there's nowhere to go. You're trapped. So... So you get down on all fours, and then I get on your back and start smacking you about. That's exactly my point. I might enjoy that. Enjoy what? The fencing or the smacking? Well, I think we all know which one he enjoys more. All I'm saying is that the horses aren't suffering like you think they are. And the whipping just helps them to focus. [THUNDER RUMBLING] ED: No, but look, here's the thing, right? A guy is interested in the girl because he finds her attractive. So then he forces himself through all the bullshit and gets her into bed. But then he realizes the sex isn't what he visualized from all the porn he's been watching all his life. Oh, my God, that's horrible. Well, on the flip side, the girl was looking for that romantic, magical feeling that she's seen in all the Hollywood movies that they've been pumping out for decades. But it's just not there. Because in the real world, if a guy were to act like a... the male protagonist from a rom-com, she'd lose interest really fast and find him creepy and needy. Real romance requires a real connection. Real bond. That comes from real life events. It can't be forced. It just comes from personalities crossing paths and fitting together at the right time. That's why so many people are cheating while in marriages... 'cause it's all fake. So I guess we shouldn't be getting married then. So how long have you been together now? Uh, about ten months, right? Eleven months. Yeah. Eleven months and two days. But this hottie right here is my true love since school. Speaking of which, have you... Have you told him about your secret lesbian experience? Oh, I've definitely not heard this one. Thanks, Grace. It's not a secret anymore, is it? Well, are you gonna tell him, or should I? All right, all right. It's my story, so... I'll tell it. So... [BOTH LAUGHING] Okay, okay. I'd just broken up with Tom, because he was a total asshole, right? And I decided that I needed to take a break from dating. Then, when I finally wanted to get back to it, I decided that I wanted to date a woman. You know, the self-pleasuring thing had become boring. So... I paid a visit to my local gay bar. Oh, that's the best place to pick out women - for me too... - Shush! Ed. Do you want to hear the story or not? Anyway, I was so turned on that night and I met the most beautiful woman, and after some drinks and flirting, we decided to go back to her place. And then when we finally got there, we move to the bedroom. We... We were just ripping each other's clothes off without hesitation. And then we... We launch into what can only be described as... hot animalistic sex. Everything was perfect... Then, she says, "Wait here, I'll be right back." - Oh! - [CHUCKLES] She comes back wearing a strap-on. - A strap on? - Yes. Of which I am to be the recipient. I mean, I'm not opposed to strap-ons, but... well, I was in a man hating-mode, right? And I decided that I wanted to come back to the touch and feel of a woman. Not dangly bits. But being the team player I am, I... I powered through. Then she climbs off me, she straddles my face. And she starts jerking herself off. [CHUCKLES] Yeah. Saying to me in not so many words that I'm about to get it. So I'm thinking, "Wow, this chick is really into "the whole role-playing experience." When all of a sudden, my entire face, neck, and chest gets covered... Covered in what? It was a fucking squirting strap-on. Yeah. I looked like the cheerleader who'd taken it from the entire football team. I mean, what the fuck? You're telling me they've got a strap-on that can squirt? - Anyway... - [LAUGHS] Strap-on cum is easier to wash off than real cum. Even from your hair. [LAUGHS] Then I got my snuggle, and, well, I left and... I haven't seen her since. [LAUGHTER] At least it can't get you pregnant. Thanks for reminding me I'm fucking infertile, Grace. Liv, you're drunk. She didn't mean... Whose side are you on, Ed? Wait... Grace, I made your favorite honey cheesecake. Aww. That's sweet. Thanks, Ed. So Liv tells me that you're moving down to London. GRACE: Yep. Trying to get out of my comfort zone. Don't you dare forget to visit me. Well, that depends. On? On whether I meet a charming and handsome man. Someone like Ed. No, I think I can do better. Hmm. Yeah, you probably can. I wouldn't date me either. - Mm-mm. - No. Got some terrible habits, haven't I? Yeah, many. You don't want to know. GRACE: Like? Well, I do too much ironing, um... - [RAIN PATTERING] - [THUNDER RUMBLING] [SNIFFLING] [SOBBING] - [RAIN PATTERING] - [THUNDER RUMBLING] [EXHALES] [RUSTLING] Hello? Who's there? I see you're enjoying the cigar then. Yeah. I'm sorry about earlier. Don't worry about it. Does it bother you that she can't have kids? Sometimes. But I don't like to think that far ahead. Why'd you really come here? - I did try and call you to tell you... - Look. Look. I don't wanna talk about that. - Ed, there's something. - Christ! There's nothing to talk about. Just enjoy your weekend here. Why are you being like this? Because there's always someone listening. Who's listening? That fucking weirdo, David. Jenny called me earlier. She said I can start the babysitting job next week. You know, they say it's bad for you to use your phone before sleeping. Something about suppressed levels of melatonin and exposure to blue light. Really? Is it also bad if I see you exposed? Why has everything got to be sexual with you, babe? I see you're in a better mood then. It's your birthday weekend. I don't want to talk about it, okay? Is this the part where you tell me to wait - while you get a strap-on? - [CHUCKLES] That story has really got into your head, hasn't it? Come here. Love you. You do? Of course. I want you to know whatever happens, I'll never leave you. No, wait. She'll hear us. That's the fun part. [CREAKING] [ELECTRIC TOOTHBRUSH WHIRRING] [MELANCHOLY MUSIC PLAYING] [SOBBING] [THUD] [THUD] [OMINOUS MUSIC PLAYING] - [REPETITIVE THUMPING] - [LIV AND ED TALKING INDISTINCTLY] [HEAVY BREATHING] [KNOCKING ON DOOR] Morning. Hey. Just want to apologize for last night. - It wasn't cool. - No. No, I'm sorry too. [SNIFFLING] Hey. Hey, what's the matter? Ah... Just... Doesn't matter. I'm okay. It's about last night. No, no, no. Honestly... I'm fine. Um... We're gonna go for a walk after breakfast. Do you wanna come? Yeah. Yeah, sure. All right. Cool. I'll see you downstairs. - Okay. - Okay. Oh, um, Liv? Yeah? I don't have anything to wear for the walk. Oh, just grab something from my wardrobe in your room. Okay. Thanks. [OMINOUS MUSIC PLAYING] [PEPPY MUSIC PLAYING ON STEREO] GRACE: You sure you're okay? LIV: Yeah. Yeah, hundred percent. So you guys have got pretty serious, I see. Yeah. I mean, that's a good thing, right? It's a phase most relationships go through. Yeah, and then the sex slowly dies off. [CHUCKLES] It's not always the case, though. Some couples do into their 60s. - That's comforting to know. - [BOTH LAUGH] Sometimes I feel like he's gonna leave me. What makes you say that? He's so smart and hard-working. He's got everything that he needs, and I'm just wondering what does he get from me? And how I'm just... I'm constantly trying to please him and... And be there for him and make him happy, you know. Sometimes I just get the impression I'm always doing the wrong thing or... Or I've said the wrong thing. Then I just... I get this guilty feeling, like it's all my fault. That feeling, it just... takes over and destroys me. [SIGHS] Am I even making any sense? Yeah. Yeah, I completely get you. But the thing is, Liv, it's that you're also smart and stunning. You don't have to build your life around him. Go and find something you want to do. Something for yourself. So, I felt like this is none of my business, but I've got to ask. What happened with you two last night? What do you mean? Just heard some banging and shouting coming from your room. Oh, that, yeah. He does some crazy workout before bed. Hey. There you go. Hi. What are you two talking about? Just girly stuff. Heavy mind. Look, there's that freak again. - Hi. - Shit. Gracie, I forgot you were coming. I'm just heading out for a class. - I can come back later if you want. - No, no, no, It's fine. - Ed's inside. Um, I'll see you later. - Okay. Ed. [SLOW INSTRUMENTAL MUSIC PLAYING] [EXHALES HEAVILY] - What's your problem? - Don't shout at him. Get back inside. Fucking nut job. [CUTLERY CLANKING] Babe, did you say something to Grace about us? I probably have to say the cornflower. [STAMMERS] Cornflower symbolizes hope. Yeah, that's right. Cornflower also known as ba... bachelor's button or basket flower. Yeah. How do you know so much about flowers? I read books on British flowers. Probably know more than my local florist. Ed? Hm? What? What did you say to Grace last night? I saw you two together. Nothing. Why? She's just been poking around asking questions. So I thought you might have said stuff. I just said nothing, didn't I? Yeah, I heard you. There's no need to shout. David, I have to ask you something. And I need you to tell me the truth. Can you do that? Yesterday you said to me "bad." What's bad? I wasn't shouting. - This is my calm voice. - You were shouting. I was shouting? Okay. Do you wanna hear my shouting voice? This is me fucking shouting! Don't start. Because you'll regret it like you always fucking do! - You... You're doing it again. - I'm doing what? [SHOUTING] Trying to make me feel... [IN NORMAL VOICE] Trying to make me feel like I'm the guilty one here. - So I'm the one to blame? - I never said that. Well, weren't you implying it? - Tell me! - I've already told you. I didn't say anything to your stupid friend about us. My stupid friend, who came here to celebrate your birthday? I never asked for that. You're an ungrateful prick. Don't you dare start telling me how ungrateful I am. I let you live here. I support you in everything. You wanted to be an artist, so I paid for your art classes for six weeks until you went to play piano. And guess who paid for those too? Me. Me. Well, when a man, a real fucking man loves a woman, he'd do anything for her. And for the record, I had to quit that class - because the guy wanted to sleep with me. - [ED LAUGHS] Well, maybe you should have slept with him. - Fuck you! - Fuck you. You begged me to move out here with you. I left my friends and family for you! So what am I supposed to do? Get a job. Did you see something bad happen at that house? What did you see, David? Did you see someone doing bad things? Is that what you meant? What did you see, David? [BREATHING HEAVILY] [CONTINUES BREATHING HEAVILY] What happened? Where's Liv? She's, uh... She's upstairs. [CRYING] Oh, my God, Liv. Did he do this to you? How long has this been going on? A few months. It wasn't always like this, though. We used to go out for meals and trips to the seaside. We were proper in love. Like the perfect couple, you know. He made me so happy. [SNIFFLES] And then... he started to take on more cases from work. And he just stopped caring. He doesn't even make an effort to talk to me anymore. It's like I don't exist in his life. And when I would try to make effort, he would just tell me that I wasn't giving him enough space. No, stop, stop, Liv. None of this is your fault. You guys, you just shouldn't be together. It's not that easy, Grace. Why isn't it? I can't live without him. I just can't. Well, if you don't tell him, I will. No. No, no, you can't. He said if anyone ever found out, he would kill himself, Grace. - No, Liv, this isn't healthy. - No, wait. What? I hate him for what he's done to me, I do. - Why didn't you tell me? - What was I supposed to say? Well, I could have helped you. I want to get back at him. I've just never had the courage to do anything by myself. What do you want to do to him? [ED SNIFFLES] [ED CLEARS THROAT, SNIFFLES] [ED CRYING] Is she okay? Yeah, she's fine. Did she tell you what happened? Yeah, she did. Look... we've all been having a hard time lately. Why don't we have a few drinks tonight, yeah? I just love her so fucking much, you know. It just hurts me to see her like this. Yeah, I know. I know. Everything's gonna be fine. ♪ All I want to do Is lift you high, baby... GRACE: Someone used a... LIV: No. That was so good. [SPEAKING INDISTINCTLY] ED: Baby. Why don't you tell us another lesbian story? Mm-hmm. I've got no more. Well, that's right. Do you know why? Why? 'Cause you too can create a new lesbian story. [LAUGHS] Ha. In your dreams, Ed. Let's play a game. ED: I love games. You're gonna be blindfolded, one of us is gonna dance with you, and you have to guess who it is.

Well, how am I supposed to know? I did not think about this. Try his birthday. Okay. - [SAFE BEEPS] - LIV: Fuck. What do you think it could be? Um... Try your birthday. Okay. [SAFE BEEPS] Um... Polly. - Try Polly's birthday. - Polly's birthday, right, okay. [SAFE BEEPS OPEN] Jackpot. Fuck! How much money is that? I know. I told you. Are we just gonna walk out of here like this? No, of course not. We're not stupid. He'll know it's us. I'll come up with an excuse for us to get away in the morning, okay? Well, what if he finds out his things are missing before we leave? Then I'll tell him that we've been burgled. Yeah? It sounds like you got it all figured out then. [POLLY PANTING] [SIGHING IN RELIEF] Hey, let's keep looking, okay? You look in there. - Grace. - Yeah. [CLANKS] I know he's got more stuff in here. Just need to find it. Take this. [POLLY YELPS] Shit. Shit! Oh, my God. I think I'm gonna be sick. [GAGS, COUGHS] What the fuck are we gonna do now? - Liv? - I'm thinking. [BREATH TREMBLING] We're gonna have to bury the dog. And we leave before he finds out she's even gone. This is insane. We're seriously fucked. [TENSE MUSIC PLAYING] Polly. Walkies time. Hmm. That's odd. Polly. Where are you, girl? Have you seen the dog? What's up? Did something happen to the dog? What? No. I think someone broke in last night. - And then... - So you haven't seen Polly? No, Ed. I haven't seen your flipping dog. [DOOR CLOSES] Polly. He's gonna find it. No. He won't. He's standing right next to it. He's gonna see the dog. Oh, my God. Polly! See? Told you. How could he have not found it? I don't know. Let's get our things and go. I don't think it's a good time to leave. He'll know. I have an idea. Fuck! Babe, maybe Polly got scared by the burglars last night and just ran off somewhere. Well, maybe they took her. No. I really don't think they came here to take your dog, Ed. Listen. Grace and I will go out for a drive to look for her. And I'll call you if we find her. - I'll come with you. - No, I... I think you should stay here in case she comes back, right? I said I'm coming with you. What's this, Liv? What the fuck? [GROANS] Ed! That's enough! [PANTING] [CRYING] [ED GROANING SOFTLY] Ed. Ed, what's going on? [GROANS] What? Liv. Why am I being tied up? I'm disappointed in you, Grace. What are you talking about? What's wrong with Ed? He's in a happy place right now. Look at him. [CHUCKLES SOFTLY] Oh, sorry. You know, it's actually quite ironic, given your profession. What? The last time you came, after you left, I found something that belonged to you... in the shower room upstairs. A hair. You see, I know how particular Ed is about that room. Not even I'm allowed to use it. At first I told myself it was nothing. But then my suspicion grew after I heard you two talking last night. [MUMBLES] Shut up, Ed! Why would you want to be with a woman beater, anyway? I'm pregnant. What? I'm pregnant. What? Why didn't you tell me? I tried to tell you. Liv... I love you so much. Oh. Do you? Yeah. Fuck you! [LIV CRIES] [GRUNTS] Can you stop it? Please stop it. [BREATHES HEAVILY] And what? What were you gonna do anyway? Run off together with your little baby? That wasn't the first time you hit him, was it? What did you say? I figured you might have heard us talking last night, so I needed some leverage. I knew something strange was happening from the moment I got here. Then when I asked David, he told me everything. What did you see, David? [INAUDIBLE] Told you what? That you abuse him, day after day. The screaming and the self-harming. And you believe that freak? Even if you did, what are you gonna do? Tell people that I beat him up? [SCOFFS] They'll laugh in your face. Well, you see, I didn't believe David at first. Liv, it's gonna be okay. It's okay. Look at me. [LIV CRYING AND SCREAMING] Liv, please. Then I copied the videos onto my phone. I can't believe the friend that I grew up with could do that. I wanted to see what you would do, so I played along. But you lied and manipulated me, just like you do with Ed. Can we please not do this? I promise you, I'll never leave you. - Give me your phone, Grace. - No, I can't do that. - Give me your phone! - Or what? You're gonna kill me, like you killed his dog? You killed Polly? I didn't kill your dog. It was an accident. It was your idea to rob him. What? Hey... I trusted you. I trusted you with everything. How could you do this to me? What are you doing to him? [SCREAMS IN PAIN] He's got many more fingers, Grace. So take your time while you figure out to tell me where your phone is. You're crazy. You really need some help. This isn't normal. [ED GROANS] Okay, okay. I'll give it to you. It's in my car. Where's your car key? Here, in my pocket. Quick, untie me. [GASPS] No, no, no, no. Baby, stay with me. You're gonna be okay. I'm sorry. No. No, it's okay. It's okay. You promised me you'd never leave me. Yeah. [CHOKING] Look what you've done, you bitch! I'm gonna fucking kill you! GRACE: No. [TENSE MUSIC PLAYING] Liv, we don't have to do this. [WHIMPERING] [GRUNTS] [BOTH GRUNTING] Fuck! No! [GRUNTS] [GRACE PANTING] Shit. Keys. [BREATHING HEAVILY] [WHIMPERING] [GASPS] Gracie. Are you looking for these? [KEYS JANGLING] Strap on this. - Ah! - Give me the keys! [GRUNTING] [GROANS, BREATHING HEAVILY] [PANTING] [GRUNTS] [PANTING] [CHOKING] [BOTH GASPING] [ED LAUGHING] [BOTH LAUGHING] I got you. [NOTIFICATION DINGS] Who's that? - A friend. - Oh, a friend. Yeah. She wants to meet you. Mmm. Tell me about her. Well...
