I got some bad news. I can't make it to your ceremony tonight. Kev... You know how short-staffed neurology is. I would obviously much rather be strutting the red carpet with you. You understand, right? Fine. But we're still on for later? Mm. [whispers] I'm ovulating. [chuckles awkwardly] [chuckling] All right, lovebirds. I thought this was a professional establishment. Oh, speaking of lovebirds-- Kev, you have failed at your matchmaking skills. When you gonna hook Terry up with one of your surgeon friends? Tyler needs a father figure, you know. -I'll work on it. -Don't work too hard. Surgeon's one of the top three careers of narcissists. No offense, Kevin. On that note-- sorry again about tonight. [smooch] What's he sorry for? He can't make it to the ceremony tonight. How does something always manage to pop up for him when something big is happening for you? His unit is short-staffed, T. Give him a break. You're always giving him a break. He doesn't prioritize you, Kendra. He's a doctor, Terry. Doctor duties trump photographer duties. Okay, well, your work matters, too! [chuckles] Does it really? I mean, I fell in love with photography because it means that I could shine a light on things that people forget to look at, not... [quietly] ...take shiny photos of celebrities. Wow. That's a gross oversimplification of what you do, Kendra. I guess. Girl... I am so proud of you. Mm. Thank you. And I got you tonight. I'll be your date. -What? -Yeah! Come here. Mwah. You're the best. Oh, don't think I'm just doing this out of the kindness of my heart. You owe me one. Be my plus-one to the Hammon fundraiser I'm organizing for us Chicago alumni. I don't know, Terry. Why not? You worried it's gonna bring back the memories of the epic romance and heartbreak you had with Ben? No, because I don't wanna do the whole, like, awkward-socializing thing. Besides, I only went there for one year. No one probably remembers me anyways. I'll jog their memory. You'll be fine. -Fine, Terry. -Bet. Now, are we still on for lunch, or are you too busy getting your Annie Leibowitz on? One more look and I'm done. Sit. Thank you. Have a scone, coffee. I'll be right back, okay? [♪] [exhales contentedly] [♪] [line rings] [recording] Hey, it's Sasha. Leave a message. -[beep] -Hey, Sash. Just, uh, calling to check in on Dad. Call me back when you can. Okay. I love you. Hi, baby. Hi. [smooch] I'm exhausted. Come here. Honey, I'm beat. If we're gonna use the rhythm method, babe, we have to follow... the rhythm? I want a family, Kevin. So do I, babe, but I'm exhausted. [drops shoe] Try again tomorrow night. I can't. I told Terry I was going to that Hammon fundraiser with her tomorrow night, because we agreed on tonight. And life happens, Kendra. I don't know what to tell you. Not everything revolves around your schedule. I never said it did. But you're acting like it. No, I'm not! Fine. Um... how about we just... ...try first thing tomorrow morning, before I go to the studio, hmm? [forced chuckle] I have to be back at the hospital for six, to relieve the overnight. Maybe it's not the best time to be going for this. Both our schedules are nuts right now. It's never gonna be a "right time," Kevin. We have to decide to make it the right time. Well, we'll talk about it when I'm all here. [♪] [phone rings] [ringing] Hello? Hey, Sash. It was amazing being honored. I kind of can't believe it. How's Dad? Oh, no, no, no, don't-- don't wake him up. I'll just-- I'll call tomorrow. [chuckles] How are you? Yeah? [♪] You ready for me? Yep. It's signed and ready to go. Wow. Those are beautiful, Ken. Thanks. [sighs] Now let's see if I can get a magazine to feature them. All your celebrity editorial work will open doors. Just keep pushing. Thanks. Hey, Liberty? Could you help Terry bring that photo down, please? Yeah, sure. Do you want me to pick you up at yours tonight, or are you gonna meet me there? Oh, I'm-- I'm pretty swamped here. Uh-uh! I don't wanna hear it! You owe me. [chuckles, scoffing lightly] Fine. You're killing me, Terry. I'll pick you up. I don't trust you to make it there. Okay, come on. Thanks, Liberty. [♪] [footsteps] [Kevin] You look beautiful. I'm sorry I wasn't up to it last night. I feel really alone in this when you tell me it's not the right time. I thought you wanted this. We talked about this, Kev. I do. I just don't want the stress of this to break us. I've got a biological clock! I know, baby. Let me make it up to you. How? Kev, no. Stop! Stop. I have to go. I'll make it quick. No. Kev... no! I wanna make a baby with you. [laughing] No! [♪] ♪ People ask why ♪ ♪ A smile is on my face... ♪ -Thank you. -Mm-hmm. -Cheers. -Cheers! Girl, this is amazing.

No. You don't have to do that. Yeah, I know, but I want to. I'm really proud of you, Kendra. You're doing exactly what you said you wanted to be doing. And it's so inspiring. And being named the most influential photographer in Chicago? Like... you're really a big-shot now. Are you... -keeping tabs on me, Ben? -Huh? -You keeping tabs on me? -No! Me and Terry, we're friends on Facebook, and, you know, she, um... she just-- she posts a lot! -You know. -Oh... okay. Okay. [chuckling] So, how's the family? Good. Miles is finally settling into high school. We moved out here a couple years ago 'cause of Connie's job, and it has taken him until now to find his people and hit his stride. But he's thriving now. That's great. Yeah, I'm... I'm really proud of him. Mm. And how's Connie? Connie's... Connie. Just doing her best impression of a helicopter-- just micromanaging, and chasing the hell out of Miles, like he's still a toddler. -Yeah. -Yeah. Well, I'm sure it's hard letting go. Yeah. Uh, I-I should probably get back. Stay. Please? It's really good seeing you. Will you sit with me a minute? What have you been doing with your life, besides stalking Terry's Facebook page? [chuckles] Um... I'm a lawyer now. Oh! You don't say. You're disappointed in me? No! Come on, Ben, that's impressive. You know, you're an awful liar. I really thought you weren't into law at all. I wasn't. Until I took... [deep breath] ...this communications class that... it-it shifted my perspective. One day, the professor was lecturing, and he said, "the best lawyers are the best storytellers," and that a person's freedom is... really just hinged on who can tell the jury, not just the most convincing, but the most compelling story. And... ...I actually thought about you. Me? [chuckles] Yeah. And in that moment, I decided... "I'm gonna be a public defender." That's really amazing. [chuckles] I mean, only you... only you could figure out how to make your parents happy and not sell your soul. Speaking of parents, um, how's your dad? He's okay. Yeah? Actually, no. He's not. He's sick. Heart failure. The... doctors are talking about, you know, going the transplant route, but he's just so stubborn. I travel to North Carolina often to visit my parents, and I would love to visit him the next time I'm there, if that's not too weird, of course. He probably doesn't even remember me. -No! No. -You know, I always -really liked your father. -No, no. He actually really liked you. I think he'd be very happy to see you. Great. Then I'll make it happen. Thanks. [sighs] Oh, Kendra. I've really missed you. Mm-mm. Don't do that. Do not... Don't say that. Why not? I've been sitting here, playing along, while you're pretending like we're buds. I'm not pretending about anything. Are you seriously saying you miss me right now? You're lying. -I'm not lying. -Yes, you are! It's not a lie. Y-- You know what? -Look, just-- -No! Do not touch me, Ben. It's too late for all that. Can we just sit and talk about this reasonably? -Please? -Reasonably? Like you didn't act like a plague came to your doorstep -when I came to your-- -Come on, Kendra! That's not fair! You caught me completely off-guard! You showed up to my doorstep unannounced after ignoring me for how many months? It doesn't matter! None of this matters anymore! It's ancient history. We're nothing to each other now. Come on-- Take care of yourself, Ben. Seriously. That's how you... [♪] [Terry] Girl, are you ever gonna tell me about your run-in with Ben the other night? [Kendra] There's nothing to tell. Okay, sure. That's why you ran out like the building was on fire. [laughs] I did not-- Shut your mouth while you're lying to me. Uh-uh. We just caught up. I mean, I managed to play along with the buddy-buddy vibes for a minute, but homeboy acted like he had an aneurysm and said that he missed me, so I dismissed myself. Because he said he missed you? Yes. I'm married. Happily married. Okay, what does one have to do with the other? -Terry, don't go there. -No, it's a genuine question. Okay. Enough about me. How did the meeting go at the community board? Fine, I think. You know, they're pretty old-school, so anything new is like absolute poison to them, but... I think I had them interested by the end. Oh. I am so proud of you. No, seriously, like... just investing your own money, choosing purpose over security-- you are truly an inspiration. Tch! Terry. Terry, listen to me. What you're doing is so special. I mean, I don't see why they wouldn't invest. Honestly. Thanks, Ken. I really hope so. Especially now that Tyler got into that private school. Oh, he did? -Yeah! -Oh, that's amazing! -Good. Good, good. -Yeah, it is. The only problem is, that even with the scholarship, it's still crazy expensive. Tell his father to contribute. Look, I-- I know he wants to do the whole 'rolling stone' thing, but one-night stand or not, he's still Tyler's father. You shouldn't be the only one making sacrifices. You're right. You know, I'll... I'll ask him. Okay. Good. Yeah. And if he doesn't step up, remember-- what's mine is yours. You hear me? I love you. I love you, too. [phone rings] Oh. Let's see. Let me take this. Hey. Hey, Sash, what's up? Wait, wait, wait, wait. Sash. Slow down. Slow down. -Is everything okay? -No! No. Oh, my god! No, Dad. Sash, come on, no!

Um, you-you could've brought Connie along. We're kind of separated now. Well, not "kind of". Legally. Legally separated. I'm sorry, Ben. I appreciate that. Can I ask you something? The last time we saw each other... when you came to Hammon that spring... ...why'd you come? Um... Ben, it's... there's no point in rehashing the past. It's over. I just wanna know. [sighs] Fine. I came to Hammon to tell you that I wanted to be with you, and you didn't feel the same. You wanted to make it work with Connie, and I made peace with that. [laughs] Yo, that's not the full story. You iced me out, Kendra. All those months, Connie and I were just co-parenting. And I told you that, but for some reason, you just-- No. No, you obviously were-- you were lying to yourself and to me, because... when I left the picture, you fell in love and you got married. I never fell in love with Connie, Kendra. So, please, when you tell our story... just don't forget that I never left you. I chose you. Are you okay? [♪♪] I'm sorry. Yeah, I should... I should get back. [♪] [crickets chirping] She doesn't want any. And she barely ate the pasta. Ooh... saint. How are you? Well... ...tired, sad, a little... relieved. Which I feel terrible for saying. You shouldn't feel terrible at all. You were bearing the brunt of it this past year. I am so sorry I wasn't there. You don't need to apologize. You were paying for all of his nurses, all that expensive equipment. But I wasn't here. -[music begins playing upstairs] -Well, you are now. You know, don't be so rough with yourself. [♪] She's gotten really into Dad's record collection. She's been playing it nonstop. That was her guy, you know? The one consistent man in her life. She's hurting so much and there's nothing I can do. When is Sunny out of school? In a couple of weeks. Maybe she can spend the summer with me. The city energy... change of scenery... it might do her some good. Kendra, that's too much. You've been balancing the world on your shoulders for a minute now. Let me take some of that weight off. Thank you. [♪♪] [app alert chimes] [♪♪] [♪] [door thuds] [lips smacking] Kendra, wh-- What are you doing here? Who-- Who is this? -No, it's not what you think. -Don't lie to me! Okay, look, I'm an idiot. I'm begging for your baby, you're inside other women? Kendra, I'm sorry. Let's just go home and we can talk about this-- I have nothing to say to you right now! Really, Kevin? You do this to me now? My father just died! Look, I'm sorry. -Let's just go. -Kevin, no! Get out of here! [♪] Kendra. Kendra! [footsteps quickening] -[door thuds] -[lock clicks] [panicked] Kendra? -Open the door, babe. -[engine starts] [tires squeal] [phone rings] [ringing] [♪♪] Hey, how'd you sleep? Let me get you some coffee. Stop tossing the ball at the table. Nice arm, little man. Thanks, Godma. Tyler, baby, go get ready for school. I'm so sorry, Ken. You know you can stay here as long as you need. I have to talk to him before Sunny gets here. Well, what is there to talk about? You caught him red-handed. He's still my husband, Terry. You don't have to remind me, Ken. He's the one who forgot. I have to hear to him out. It's only fair to him. What about you? Hmm? What's fair to you? I'm not a quitter. It's not quitting, Ken. It's respecting yourself enough to not let someone mistreat you. [phone rings] [sighs] It's him. Ken, don't. Terry. Terry, I'm good. Good things are hard sometimes. Just because they're hard doesn't make them good. -[rings] -Come on, just-- Just a sec. Hello, Kevin. [sighs] [door opens] Baby, I am so sorry. How long? A few weeks, a month. Do you love her? No. No, it was just sex. Why? Why would you risk what we have for-- I was just feeling so much pressure with the fertility stuff, and we were both working nonstop. There's no excuse-- I betrayed you. Yeah, you did. You broke my trust and I don't know how this is gonna work without it. We vowed, "for better or for worse". Let me regain your trust. Can you let me do that? We owe it to each other to fight for this. We're fighters. Have you done this before? No. Kevin, tell me the truth. I've never broken our marriage vows before. Never. You need to end it. I already did. And I swear, Kevin, if you ever do this again-- Never! Never again. Hey... thank you for not giving up on us. I'm sorry. [smooching] I'm so sorry. [♪♪] Nice! Ladies, this way-- this way for me. Thank you. Looks good. One more. A little more movement? Attitude! Three more shots. Here we go... yes, nice! Let's do a different setup. Thank you, Liberty.

She's saying I've given up and I stopped fighting, but, honestly, I don't even got no more fight left in me. How did you know...? That it was time to stop fighting? Oh, I guess when the respect leaves. When contempt just replaces that altogether? There's no working through that. [quietly] Yeah. I'm-- I'm so sorry you're going through that, Ben. Oh, yeah-- -Oh. -Oh! Hey. What'd you all find? That's a lot of birthdays' worth of albums you got there. Dang! You can just grab hers, too. Oh, no. Ben, no, you don't have to do that. It's fine. It's fine. If she ever wants a hiphop-head to hang out with, I'm sure Miles would not mind. [chuckles] [footsteps] Hey, baby. You're late. Surgery went long. I'm telling the truth. You believe me? [unconvincingly] Mm-hmm. [text alert chimes] Who's that? Ben. -Ben? -Yeah, Ben. We ran into him today at the record shop. So, Sunny and Miles-- they really hit it off. I don't know, I just think it would be really good for her to hang out with someone else other than me while she's here, so we're trying to set something up. [dryly] Is that all right with you? [forced chuckle] It's fine. Good. 'Cause... I got you something. You're...? Yeah. [laughing] Oh, baby! Oh... I love you. I love you, too.

Uh, should I be worried? You sound a little stressed out over there. Everything good? No, I'm just representing this-- this kid. He actually just turned 18 and he's a first-time offender. First time-- that's good, isn't it? Not with this judge. This judge has a record of exorbitant sentencing, especially if the youth in question is black or brown. But some of my colleagues actually been telling me about sentence-mitigation videos. What are those? Basically, these 10- to 20-minute videos that are compilations of interviews of folks speaking on the character of their clients, and they're said to have a really high success rate in swaying the judges and securing less-harsh sentences, so... You should do one for this kid. He can't afford it. I mean, between the equipment and the editing? Let me do it. What? If you haven't heard, I'm pretty good with a camera. This could really change this kid's life. Let's make sure it does. I'll just add a few things on the end... and... we're done. It just has to upload. Okay. Thank you, Ken. What?

[laughs] No. Yo, like, like, just... uh, it's a thank-you for your services, since you won't let me pay for anything. No, you don't have to do that. It was fun for me. Yeah, it was fun for me, too. [both laughing] So, are you excited about your shoot with Envoke coming up? Yeah. Yeah. That did not sound too convincing. No, don't get me wrong. I am, literally, so lucky to be making a living as a photographer, since... I'm just so happy you're letting me help you out with these videos. It feels good to do work that I love, and know that it matters to someone other than just me. You could take pictures of my other clients, too, if you want. I'm sure they'd love to have their portrait taken by Kendra Evans. Actually, that is not a bad idea. I know! Wow, that's my idea. [laughing] Okay. Hi, baby. Where you been? I was at work, finishing up those videos with Ben. It's late. Yeah, it's the final push, because the hearing is tomorrow. So it's done now? This one is, yeah. "This one"? There are other clients of his who need the same service. Have you eaten? Yeah. With Ben? Is that a problem? Just don't love the idea of my wife out late, and alone, with a cat she used to date. Kev, that was over a decade ago. We're friends. That's irrelevant to me. [scoffs] Okay, you being suspicious of me is a bit unfair. Don't you think? So you're trying to rile me up? Is that it? Punish me for what I did? Me living my life is not retaliation, Kev. [snickers bitterly] Invite him over. What? Well, if he's your friend, I want to get to know him better. It's only fair, right? Of course. Yeah. [Kevin] So glad you could come tonight. Let me pour you another glass. Honey, maybe we should try some water. I'm fine. [♪♪] We're all having fun, right? [Kendra] Mm. So, Kendra says the hearing went well? It did. It did. It went-- It went great. We got him six months in jail, 18 months probation. And that's good? It's appropriate. And that's all we wanted. So the video helped? It did. That kid would've lost years of his life, instead of months, if it weren't for Ken. Thank you. "Ken". [chuckles] That's cute. Sure you don't want anything to drink, Ken? I'm good. Well, she can't drink in her state. [reproachfully] Kevin. Oh, wait, are-- are you pregnant? I just found out. Well, we didn't just find out. It's been a few weeks. You're having a baby, Auntie? Congratulations. Thank you, sweetie. Congrats. Thank you. Well, congratulations. Um... kids are a gift. [Kevin] Thanks, man. We're really excited. Uh, you had Miles in college, yeah? Yep. I-I got my gift early. Well, that must have been hard. You know, being a kid, raising a kid? It's hard enough not to mess them up when you're a grown-up. Kevin. Age is just one aspect of maturity, but it's not all of it. I know a lot of childish grown-ups. Where's your wife? She really should have come. Okay! I think it's time for some dessert. My bad. Kendra told me you were getting a divorce. Ah, that's too bad, man. But I guess it makes sense. You can't really expect a happy ending off of a shotgun wedding. [Kendra] Kevin, enough. Miles, let's go. Thank you guys for dinner. Thanks, Kendra. [♪] Can you wait for me in the car? [door thuds] I am so sorry. Sorry about what? For his behavior. His behavior isn't your responsibility. Well, you did not deserve that. Why didn't you tell me? About the baby? I... I'm-- I'm not sure. All right. Um... I'm just gonna give you some space. But why? I-- Why? I don't need space. Yeah, but I do, Ken. I do. [door slams] You embarrassed me. -Excuse me? -You heard me, Kevin! You embarrassed me. Insinuating I had too much to drink? Making eyes at Ben the whole night? I was not making eyes at Ben. You were flirting with him right in front of me. I was not flirting with him, Kevin. He is my friend! Friends, my ass! Okay, you better lower your voice right now, because-- Don't tell me to lower my voice in my own house! You're punishing me. -"Punishing" you, Kevin? -I'm sick of you punishing me! You're throwing this guy in my face! It was your idea to invite him! Are you screwing him? -[rapid footsteps] -What? You heard me! Is this baby even mine? Is everything okay? How dare you? Yeah. Yeah, yeah. Yeah, yeah. We're-- we're fine, honey. We're just having a conversation. [door slams] Any news on the community board? It's a no-go. The budget is stretched out too thin. Oh, I am so sorry, girl. Oh, it's fine. Mm-- my offer still stands for Tyler's tuition, okay? You know, his dad actually agreed to cover it. What? Cheers! Yeah, I mean... It's what he should be doing anyways. I'm just glad you didn't have to fight him on it. Yeah, I know. How's the dust settling after the big blowout? Is Kevin still acting stupid? He is... he is just so convinced that me and Ben still have a thing for each other. It's ridiculous. Is it, though? [reproachfully] Terry. [mimicking her] Kendra. -Terry! -No. You're gonna tell me spending all this time alone with Ben isn't bringing up any feelings for you? Of course, it does sometimes, I'm human. Sometimes, I wonder if, like, I made the right decision or not back then... but I have a beautiful life. I'm married. I'm pregnant. This is my life, and I am okay with that. I am. Where's Sunny? She's spending the night at Liberty's. Do you know what this $3,300 wire from our checking is for? Oh. I, um... I sent Jesse some money-- just a loan-- to fix her car. Y-You know, she's been struggling ever since she got laid off. Why didn't you talk to me about this? Because you're my wife, not my mother. I don't have to ask for permission to take care of my sister. Hold on. I'm not saying you-- Wow, you are addicted to having problems. I am not starting an argument. I'm simply asking a question. [scoffs bitterly] I'm not doing this with you. [♪♪] Hey, Jesse! How are you? Good. Good, good. I'm sorry to call you so late. I was just calling to see if you got your car sorted. No, Kevin, he-- he told me... Oh, no. No, girl, I-- I must have misheard him. Uh, okay. Okay, will do. Bye-bye. Hello, yes. It's Kendra Evans. I'm wondering if you can give me the name of a payee I've wired? It's not on my statement, and I'm just trying to get my books together. The date is June 15th. $3,300. Are you sure that's the right--? Yeah. Yes, thank you. Thank you. Uh, no. No, that's all. All right, thank you. [exhales] [brakes screech] [bangs door shut] [thumping] Kendra! Why did Kevin wire you $3,300? [snaps] Answer the question! M... M-Mommy? Back to sleep, baby. Go back to sleep. Is... [gasps] Wait, is he Kevin's? [exhales] [tearing up] How could...? I-I-I'm so sorry, Kendra! How could you do that to me, Terry? [Terry sobs] I thought we were a family, Terry! I thought-- We are! Please come in and I'll explain everything. No, go ahead! Go ahead, explain, Terry. [breath shaking] You two were broken up. A-And it was just one night and-- a-and we were both drunk and sad, and... I couldn't lose you over a mistake, Ken-- It wasn't a mistake, Terry! A mistake happens once! You lied to me for years! I was just young, and stupid, and-- No, Ken-- Kendra! Kendra, wait! Kendra. Kendra-- No, Kendra! No! What can I do? I'll do anything. No, Terry! You broke us, Terry. You broke us! -No-- -There's no fixing this, Terry. I know I hurt you, Kendra, but we at least have to try-- Terry, no! Kendra, I'm sorry. [engine starts] Ken, I'm sorry! Ken, we can fix it! [♪♪] [♪♪] [splashing] [bottle smashes] [flames whoosh] [flames crackling] [click] Rise and shine. What are you doing? Packing! Where are you going? Oh, I'm not going anywhere. You are. What are you talking about? I know that wire was for Tyler. Hey. Hey, let's-- let's talk about this. No. There's nothing to talk about. Baby, calm down. I want you out! We're having a baby. You can't do this on your own! You need to call a car. -What? -I said, "You need to call a car." Yours isn't really in working condition right now. What did you do? [cheery] Let's go see.

I love you, Kendra. I know. But I'm realizing it's just not enough. It's not enough, Kevin. [Sunny] Hey... Hey. Is your car here? Yeah. Are you sure you don't want me to stay for a little longer? I can't take you away the whole summer. Your mom needs some Sunny time too, now. Yeah? Look. I'm fine, okay? I promise. Text me when you get to the airport. Oh, I almost forgot-- Oh. No, no, no, no. You keep this. It's yours. Aunt Kendra, I can't-- Yes, you can. Go. It's in good hands. Now, I want you to go take some pretty pictures, and you show me later. Okay? Thank you. You're welcome.

[stereo plays] Where have y'all been? Oh, we've just been working on photos for my college application. Oh, and can we order pizza tonight, Mom? Already one step ahead of you. Wash your hands. Set the table. [sighing] Ahh. Taking photos always helps me feel like myself, which is exactly what I needed. You know, it feels really good to be home. I didn't realize how much I missed it.

I didn't mean to show up unannounced like that, but I've just been worried. How did you know I was in town right now? Your assistant. Um, Liberty-- she told me what happened. Oh. I'm so sorry, Ken. Thanks. Yeah. Are you-- are you visiting your parents, or...? Oh. What brings you to North Carolina? You. You brought me to town, Kendra. [footsteps] Oh. -Hello, Benjamin. -Hey. I thought you were the pizza guy. No. Sorry to disappoint you. You staying for the pizza party, Ben? I know Sunny would love that. I would love to, if... -Come in. -All right. Don't you dare... Oh, hey, it's this way! [laughing] Just this way. Are you making fun of me? Oh, my goodness. I'm glad you guys invited me in. Eatin' pizza while it's really cold outside. Should we kick him out, Sunny? What do you think? [laughing] [♪] It'd just be this raggedy shirt. Yeah... Well... I guess I'll let you go? Hey, would you, um, wanna come to a barbecue with me on Saturday? A barbecue? Yeah, my parents are having their annual end-of-summer soiree. Ee... [chuckles awkwardly] Your parents? Yeah. [laughs] Are you sure they want me to come? Oh, my god! Come on, Kendra. That was, like, years ago. They'd love to see you now. O-Okay-- they'd like to see you. [Kendra laughs] Okay, now, that's better. Sure. Yeah? Yeah, I'll see you Saturday. Come here. [♪] [♪] There he is! Hey. Good to see you, man. Yeah. You too. Is this Kendra? Nice to see you, Calvin. [whispers] I always knew it was you. [louder] I told him that. What was that? What are you saying? I'm telling her the truth. How you been? I heard you're a big-time photographer now. Will you stop pressuring her, man? She hasn't even had a drink yet. Where's your manners, Calvin? I apologize. You're right. Let's save you from this drought. -Benjamin! Oh... -Hey, Mom. Where's my grandson, hmm? Um... Uh, he's-- he's with his mother. Uh, it's her weekend. Have we heard anything back about the custody hearing? Not yet, but, um, can we not have this conversation now? -Kendra. -Hi. Oh, so nice seeing you. It's lovely to see you. Did anyone offer you a drink? Uh, who raised you? Wolves? Well, actually, I-- we were about to. -Yeah, like-- -All right. I'll take care of you. My husband will be thrilled to see you. Do you play cornhole? Not recently. Okay, so, we have the punch or we have some wine... [Kendra] Question-- did your mom, by chance, hit her head before I got here, because she is like a completely different person. [laughs] Uh, she was actually diagnosed with cancer a few years back. Oh... Oh. That's terrible. I'm so sorry. No, I mean, she's good now. Sickness has this way of changing you for the better, if you allow it. Teaches you what's really important in life, and how quick everything can just go, like... [snaps] ...that. I mean, you're also a breath of fresh air, considering all the Connie drama. Your niceness is going a long way right now. Nice? Oh, you think-- I'm not nice. Yeah, I... you've-- you're pretty kind to me, Ken. You've always been kind to me. So, uh... you and Kevin... you guys are done now? Yeah. Um... may I ask why? [breath catches] You know Tyler? Yeah, um... Terry's kid. Right. Tyler's Kevin's son, too. You're kidding me? I-I get so embarrassed that it even took me that long to figure it out. Ohh. And learn. Learn what? Learn that I can change my mind. I was just so determined to make it work with Kevin, and I wasn't willing to concede that I had chose wrong, even when I was hurting. [sighing] God. Sometimes, being strong isn't... forcing something to be right that isn't. Sometimes, being strong is just surrendering. Ah, you got lucky. You said I won? What'd you say? -What? -Huh? I definitely didn't say that. -But... -Yeah. ...I'll let you have it. -Hey. Mm. Tonight was fun, though. It was fun. I'm sor-- [sighs] Look, I-I'm sorry. I-I-I can't. I'm not the 18-year-old girl you fell in love with, Ben. I just got out of a marriage... I lost a baby. And I can't pretend that none of this happened, Ben. Ken, Ken, I'm not-- I'm not asking you to pretend. I'm not asking you to be anywhere other than where you are. [♪] [♪♪] Mm. Morning. Good morning. How'd you sleep? I didn't. Remember? Oh, yeah. Could you have ever guessed we'd be back here? I prayed for it. I love you, Kendra. You know that? Mm-hmm. [quietly] That scares me. Why? Because we tried that already. I wanna make a family with you. [sighs] Just... Just be patient with me, okay? I waited 15 years, Ken. What's 15 more if it means me and you? [♪] Well, look who decided to grace us with her presence. You eat? Mm-hmm. Uh, remind me to yell at you later for teaching Sunny how to turn the bathroom into a darkroom. I nearly peed my own pants. [laughing] Now, tell me the dirt. Did you... I knew it! I knew it. [groaning] Oh! I'm not even divorced yet. He's not even divorced yet. So? It's too soon, Sash. What is it too soon for? To get hurt. I just... I don't wanna jump into something and ruin it. If that happened with Ben... oh... I don't think I would recover from that. You've been through so much these past few months. It makes complete sense to want a little recovery time. So, take the time you need to heal... all the time you need. Just make sure you're not confusing healing with avoidance. Okay? Mm, I love you.

So... the judge denied Connie full custody. That's good. That's good news! That's a relief. Yeah, but, uh... that's not all the news. Connie managed to convince the judge to grant her permission to move Miles to North Carolina, since that's where her "support system" is. You're kidding me? I wish. So? What are you gonna do? I don't wanna have to hop on a flight to see my son. No. Yeah... of course not. But, obviously, I don't want to be apart from you, either. Right. But he only has two more years left of high school, then I'll be back in Chicago with you, right? And I-- You know what? I'm not gonna leave until things give in, so that's gonna give me enough time to wrap things up, and it's gonna give us more time. We'll be able to get through this. Of course. [♪] [♪♪] Hey! It's good to see you. -Hey! -I'm here for a pickup. -For Kendra? -Yes. -It'll be out in a few minutes. -Thank you. [background music plays] [♪♪] Hey... Hey. How are you? I'm okay. How are you? I'm... really good. I saw that you and Ben are together. Yeah, we are. I'm so happy for you, Ken, really. It was always supposed to be you two. Not that what I did was... I know what you mean. How's Tyler? He's good. Tell him I said hi, and that I really miss him. He misses you. [voice breaks] I miss you, too. If you would've just... would've been honest and just told me the truth... I'm not sure if I would've been able to understand, but I-- I really would've tried. I'm really sorry, Ken. And those aren't just words, I really hope you know that. I forgive you, Terry. I-I tried not to, but it hurts too much. And I want everything good for you. Me too. Do you think we'll ever-- [barkeep] Kendra? I have to go. Thank you. [soft music plays] [sighing] You all right? Hmm? Yeah. I'm fine. You still thinking about your run-in with Terry? Yeah... a little. Mostly just... [sighs] ...thinking about how quickly life changes. I mean, you and I, we weren't even talking four months ago. Who knows where we'll be four months from now. I'll be here. I'll be here every six weeks, just like we planned, Kendra. Ben, come on. Plans don't work. Trust me, I've learned the hard way. Hey! Come on. Come here, come here, come here. Look. Look, long distance didn't work for us last time, why would this time be any different? Of course, it's gonna be different. We both know what we want now. That doesn't guarantee us anything. Ben, nothing's guaranteed. Oh, hey, hey, this-- [sighs] Can you look at me? I love you. I'm exhausted, okay? I should just go. No, you shouldn't! You're being 18-year-old Kendra all over again-- just running. I'm not running. I'm taking a breath. I just need to breathe. All right.
