If I had been really smart, I would have died when I was a kid. I mean, that would have been a really smart thing to do. You know what saved me? Balling. God talks to me. He talks to me whenever there's his work to be done. I'm his chosen instrument. I set fire to my apartment once. They got me out but my cat died. I feel dead. Like I'm not here. I feel less here than I ever have in my life before. And that's why I came to see you, Doctor. Something is drastically wrong and I don't know if I can solve it. You want me to park it for you, Dr. Stevens? Yes, thank you, Charlie. Is that it for today? Yes, thank God. Looks like it could use a wash. The greatest thing is the security I feel when I'm in bed with a man. When we have sex, I feel successful, beautiful. I feel normal. Then I go home to my wife, my kids. And I look at them, and I face what I really am. My two daughters, they adore me. And I sit there, and all I can think is that they're looking at a monster, because that's what I really am. And I swear to myself that I'm never going to do it again. Until I have to... Oh, Christ, dear Christ! Hi. Can I see some of your roses? Well, those are red, they're $15.95. But it's such a bad day, I can let you have two dozen for $20. All right, that's fine, yeah. Another dozen just like these? We live in an amazing house overlooking the lake with a long drive leading up to it. My husband bought it for me. He's very generous. He loves me. I feel I'm being disloyal to him even being here. Do you have to have that thing on? No. We can switch it off. It's only there to remind me afterwards. What you must remember, Mrs. Blake, is whatever you tell me is just between you and me, it goes no further. It's just that I'm... I'm scared. Most people that sit in that chair feel the same way. So, don't force it. Okay? What does your husband do? He builds condominiums. He's... He builds condominiums. Maybe he built the one I live in. Is this your first marriage? Yes. And is it everything you thought it would be? I told you, I... I love my husband and he loves me. Yes, of course you did. So we're... We are not looking for anything ordinary then, are we? What does that mean? Nothing sinister, just that we can rule out the usual causes of marital troubles, sexual incompatibility, unfaithfulness, social diseases. Now the reason you came to consult with me was something deeper. Tell me, does your husband know you've come to see me? No. Would the reason for that be that the problem is his, not yours? People can imagine things, can't they? Frequently. Things that aren't necessarily true? Yes. I'll think about it some more then and I'll contact you again if I need to. I have to go. I'll call you later. Can I help you, gentlemen? Yeah, we'd like to see Dr. Stevens. May I tell him what for? Well, in a manner of speaking, no. In a manner of speaking, no. I like it. Why don't you write it down? I'm gonna use it. - Hey, Mac? - What? What do you think the tab is for a joint like this? I don't know. I guess it costs about $50 to come through this door. Well, plenty of people must think it's worth it. He's got his book all full. Well, that's because the Surgeon General hasn't determined shrinks as being bad for your health. Excuse me, gentlemen. Would you care to step in, please? Dr. Stevens will see you now. Okay. Thank you. You're welcome. This way please. Excuse me. Doctor, my name is Lieutenant McGreavy. I'm from Homicide. And this is Detective Angeli. Well, gentlemen, won't you sit down? McGreavy. We've met before, haven't we? We certainly have. As a matter of fact, we met in court, in the Zifrin case. Zifrin. Yes, I remember. But you were in a wheelchair then, you'd been shot. I was in a wheelchair, and I had been shot and my partner had been killed. And your expert testimony helped screw up justice as far as the Zifrin case was concerned. I wouldn't say that. He was committed as insane. Is he being released? Is that why you've come to see me? He's doing very well. He gets three square meals a day, which is more than I can say for my partner's wife. But that's not why we're here, sir. We were wondering if it was possible for you to identify this. It looks like one I have. It is. Well, I mean, at least it has your name stenciled inside of it. We were just wondering how it got out of your possession. Well, there's no mystery. It was raining earlier and one of my patients hadn't brought his coat, so I let him borrow that. What's this all about? Well, I'll tell you what it's all about. Somebody stuck a knife through it while your ex-patient was still wearing it. Are you telling me that Mr. Boyd has been murdered? Well, if he wasn't, it will go in the Guinness Book of Records as a suicide first. Oh, my God. Now, could you tell us approximately what time he left here? Well, his appointment was at 11:30, and the sessions usually last an hour. But he was upset today so we cut it short. I would imagine he left here around 12:10. What upset him? In simple terms, he was a bisexual, married, with two children, and trying desperately to come to terms with his homosexuality. He was a fag with a family. That is your description, not mine. Do you have any idea of his gay contacts? No. Why would I? Where was Mr. Boyd murdered? It was a couple of blocks from here. Happened about 12:20, but there was no robbery intended or anything like that. By that I mean his wallet was still intact and had a couple of hundred dollars in it. Now, there's a question that I'd like to ask you. Was he an obvious gay or was he butch? No, far from it. This is awful. I keep thinking of his poor wife and children. Did she know about him? No, I don't think so. Has she been told yet? No. Well, then I'd like to do it. I think I could possibly break the news more gently. I'm sure because I know that we cops, we jump in with both feet... No, I did not mean that. Then let me ask you a question, and I'm gonna jump in with both feet. Do any of your patients, do they love you? What the hell does that mean? That means, Doctor, translating from the French, do they have the hots for you? After all, you sit there and you listen to them, listen to all their troubles and you hold their hand and you wipe their eyes and one day a fag walks in here you see... - No, a patient walks in here... - I beg your pardon! A patient, a patient walks in. Yes. A patient walks in who can't make up his mind whether he likes boys or whether he likes girls! Now isn't it possible that this Mr. Boyd... Now, I don't wanna shock you with the terminology I'm gonna come out with, but this Mr. Boyd gets a hard-on for you and you being normal, of course, you reject him and now he threatens you with blackmail, so it's your word against his and we have the beginning of a motive. You're very lucky to go around with a colleague with such an overdeveloped sense of humor. Oh, yeah, he's a barrel of laughs on a murder case. Don't get too cute, Doctor. I don't feel "cute," as you put it. Nor do I feel that I have to stand here and listen to your innuendo. If a patient of mine has been murdered, then I shall answer any legitimate questions and do anything I can to help. But do not push your luck, Lieutenant! Just give us the files on Boyd. No way. I can get a court order. Then I suggest you get it! From what you've told me, he was knifed in the street by some random maniac and I suggest you start looking for him. You're quite right. I don't know what we're doing in your office. We should be out in the streets looking for him because you're the expert on maniacs! You know how to protect them, like you protected Zifrin! So now we're getting down to the bottom line, aren't we? No. I do not deal in maniacs. I practice a form of medicine for people who need mental help and from what I've seen, you could use a little yourself. So, you get your court order, Lieutenant, and I shall go and get myself a lawyer if I think it's necessary. You can use this way out. - What time is the Sox game tonight? - 7:30. Well, I'm gonna miss it. Tape it for me, will you? Mary. Will you have George call his wife as soon as he comes in? It's very important. Okay. Thank you. Judd, how are you? How are you? Geez, look, I'm sorry it took so long but that last one was a real bitch. In fact, the whole day has been like that. Sit down. Come on. Boy, I could use a drink. You want one? I'd love one, thanks. Sorry I've only got one glass. Johnny Walker rubbing alcohol. - No, here, you take the pretty one. - Thank you. Is something the matter? Yes. One of my patients was murdered today. Jesus. What happened? Well, I saw him this morning. And it was raining so I loaned him my raincoat, and a few minutes later he was stabbed to death on the street. You mean he was mugged? No, apparently not. Oh, boy, I tell you. It gets closer every day. Who was he? Just a harmless sort of guy. Wife, two kids. I've just broken the news to her. Anyway, the odd thing is, the two detectives that came to break the news to me were... You remember the Zifrin case? Not really. No. Well, Zifrin killed a policeman and I was the principal defense witness for a successful plea of insanity. Anyway, one of the two detectives turned out to be the ex-partner of the dead policeman. I know it sounds crazy, but he treated me like I was a suspect. Well, screw that. That's ridiculous. Well, of course it's ridiculous. But maybe they always come down that heavy. Anyway, Pete, I'll tell you something. It shook me, it really shook me up. Come on, you don't have to take that. Throw the book at them. Who needs that anyway? Yeah, Hadley. Okay, I'll come down and take a look. Listen, I gotta go. If you get any more hassle, go see the commissioner. Listen, I'd invite you home tonight but Norah and I have to socialize. I'm collecting a very fat check for our new pediatric wing. One of our prominent citizens is coughing up the last $100,000 and you know me, I'll go anywhere for a buck. - Well, thanks for your time. - Yeah. You know, I mean, I can't believe what you just told me... Evening, Charlie. I said, good evening. - Evening, Eddie. - Good evening, Dr. Stevens. You want to go up, do you? That's the usual idea. Unless of course you prefer me to sleep in the basement. What the hell are you doing in my daughter's bedroom? Get out, now! Now! Take it easy. Would you mind telling me what this is all about? All right, don't get too excited. And the answer to your next question, yes, we do have a search warrant, and there's one other thing I gotta tell you that you're... You're entitled to make a phone call to your lawyer. I mean, that's under law but I have to warn you... Now let me tell you something, McGreavy, I've just about had you two. What is this, some private grudge you're trying to work off? No, this is a perfectly legal investigation into a murder and a break-in. What break-in? At your office. Of course, you wouldn't know anything about that, would you? My office? Yeah, we'd like to know where you've been since you left it. I saw my brother-in-law at his hospital, and then I had some dinner. With your brother-in-law? No, on my own, and I still don't see how a break-in at my office entitles you to ransack my apartment! And you couldn't guess, could you? No, I couldn't! And I'll tell you something else. I am getting pissed off with your cat and mouse game! Then I suggest we go down to your office and see what's changed since you left it! Here, why don't you sit down? You sickening bastard. You left her there for me to see, didn't you? I needed positive identification. You can take her away now. Yes, sir. Let me try to explain something to you. Nobody dies easy in the real world. Now somebody comes in here, you see, and they do a job on your girl Friday. They stick a knife into her, then they torture her until she's killed! Now I would like to know why! Why? What have you got in here? What are you hiding? Why would they come in and do a thing like this? What is it? You got something stashed away? You got dope? You got money? You do use drugs, don't you? I don't keep addictive drugs. Okay, what about the files? They haven't been touched. What have you got, second sight or something? You haven't even looked at them. I don't keep written notes. Most of my case histories are taped. Then they're... They're fed into that micro over there. Unless someone knew how I coded them, they... They couldn't break into it. Well, did the girl know the code? No. God, I wish she had. If that's what they were after. Don't let it get to you. He's really a good cop. Like Hitler was a good painter. Hello, Mac. Okay, Sally. Wanna move that? Thank you very much. What are you looking so cheerful about? What kept you? I decided to stay and take a look at the autopsy. And they found she was dead, right? Oh, yeah, she's dead. She's also three months pregnant. Too late to have a safe abortion and too little to show. She's dead, and I'm an idiot 'cause I had a hunch. Sally, let me have a skim milk, would you, please? Sure thing. Well, did you talk to the boyfriend? - Of course. - What do you mean "of course"? Well, what did he say? Clean. He swore he wanted to marry her. That's an original statement. They all say that. I wonder, did he know she was pregnant? Well, I didn't ask him that. Well, why not? I didn't know she was pregnant, did I? Why didn't you know? You know why you didn't know? Because you didn't look. Okay, so, if he did get her pregnant and they were getting married anyway, what's the big deal? This thing happens every day of the week. Are we disturbing you or something? Is there something we're saying that's intriguing you? Would you do me a favor, please? Would you kindly take your stuff and move about two seats down? Don't forget your soup. That's a good girl. Now, I wanna explain something to you. A girl comes to a guy and she says to the guy, “I'm pregnant." The guy says, "I don't want any part of it." And that happens twice a day every day of the week, every week. His alibi's tight, Mac. The guy's straight. My dear naive friend, no one in this world is straight, no one. All right, come on, pay for this, - and we'll get out of here. - May I have the check? - Give him the check, Sally. - I got it. Thanks. Take care, guys. - I'll see you, Sally. - Okay, take care. I don't understand why anybody would go to a shrink that's got a black secretary, knocks her up and then has to marry her. Could be a plus. Maybe he thinks it's extra-cool. I understand people think that's macho. She was tortured. Why would he torture her? He's a smart doctor. He must know a million clever ways to kill. Maybe that's what he wants us to think. I just don't buy it. I don't think Stevens would kill twice in the same day. - For what? - What do you mean, for what? Don't you know what kind of world it is out there? They'll kill you for a book of matches, they'll beat up an old lady for a bottle of beer. For a lousy heroin fix, they'll blow you off the earth and you ask me for what? What the hell are you, a boy scout or a fucking cop? 7102, 7102. Yeah. 7102. 7102, we're on the scene. We have two homicide victims on Damon and North Avenue. All right, Damon and North Avenue, 10-4, we're on the way. Let's go! Excuse me. Stand back, please. Come on, make some room. Come on. Stand back, people, stand back. Excuse me. - What do we got? - Pair of deaths. Good, we're not in danger of slipping below the national average. It was Stevens, right? - Sir? - Forget it. Wait a minute. One thing. Did you get any descriptions here? No, Lieutenant. All we got is one guy, medium build, wearing a stocking. - Where'd he have it? On his face or his ass? - On his face. Good, then we can rule out perversion. I don't know about you, I'm getting a little old for this. I feel sick. I really feel sick. Well, anyway, we got the storybook murder, don't we? We got two victims, a gun, and a motive. That's what made America great. Yeah, well, you take care of the greatness of America. I think I'm getting a little too old to take care of the greatness. I'm going back to the office. - You the murderer? - Me? - Yeah, you. - No. Get your ass out of here. You don't need any of that, fellows, all you need is just two stretchers. Two, two, all right. Come on, open up, open up, make way. Don't let anybody touch anything until the ballistic guys get what they need. Excuse me. Mac! Mac, I don't think I follow your logic in the Stevens case. It's too much conjecture. You got no concrete evidence. What are you coming with conjecture? Concrete... How much concrete do you want? I'll tell you what we got! We got one gay guy, who is dead, who was stabbed a block away from the office. We got a little black lady who was pregnant, who is killed, right? And we got a doctor who refuses to let us look into his files and you're talking to me about conjecture. Well, then what other motive is there? Is there the motive of money? No! Is there the motive of drugs? No! Well, I think we're looking for a maniac without a motive! I think we're looking for one very smart doctor! I think you're looking to get even, Mac. - You know, we've got some spare room... - I was wondering... Norah and I... We're not pushing anything, it's... It's just that, you know, we can't help worrying about you being on your own all the time. I know how you felt about Liz and Jane. I mean, Liz was your wife and she was my sister, for Christ sakes and... You know, we all love them. We love them both, but... Judd, you gotta bury the dead. We just think it's... Honey. We feel you ought to meet people. I meet people all the time. Don't give up on me. I shall surface one of these days. I'll see you tomorrow at the hospital. - Okay. - Good night. Good night. Does this hurt? You have a hematoma there. As I touch it, does that hurt? Yes, just a little. Nurse, let's get him to X-ray and do a C-spine. How much longer? Well, Dr. Garcia would like to keep you here all night. No way. If I'm going to die, I'm gonna die in my own bed. Doctors always make the worst patients. You mean a little knowledge is a dangerous thing. Or maybe they're afraid I can't pay. Excuse me. Can I help you with something? Yes, I think she's broken her arm. - Oh, no. - Yes. Will you tell me where Dr. Stevens is, please? - Who are you? - We're the police. He's around the corner. Well, we heard you had an accident. You were lucky to escape. It was not an accident. Well, the report said you might have been jaywalking. Somebody tried to kill me. I see. So what have you come up with this time? A bike that's driving a couple of wheelchairs, or a wheelchair that's driving a couple of bikes? Lieutenant McGreavy, whether you believe me or not, an attempt was made on my life tonight. Okay, now I'm gonna tell you something. There's a possibility that you can convince me, but you gotta come up with something a little better than a cripple driving a Harley-Davidson. All right, I've been thinking. I don't believe that the killer was after Boyd or Carol. I believe he was after me. Well, that's wonderful. Now we don't just have a cripple, but we've got somebody who is short-sighted. Hey, Mac, let's hear the guy out, okay? Yeah, I'll hear him out, Angeli, I'll hear him out, but first I'm going to ask him a few questions. Do you mind? Go ahead. Boyd was wearing my coat. Obviously the killer mistook him for me. So the killer thought he killed the wrong man and then he went back to your office and he tore off your clothes and discovered this voluptuous black lady and beat you to death. Well, let me tell you something, Doctor, the lady was pregnant. You didn't know that, did you? No. I'm surprised. I thought you medical men were wonderful. I thought you had professional intuition. She was entitled to a private life of her own. She had a private life, all right! Did you know that she was a hooker before she ever went to work for you? Don't look so surprised. We ran through a computer on her, and my dear friend, - we came up with a jackpot! - Yes, I knew that! - I knew it! - You did? Then why was she working for you? Not everybody is born, as you so delicately put it, a hooker. I was trying to give her a chance in life. And maybe get a little something on the side for yourself? Get him out of here. Now wait a minute, wait a minute. I could be wrong. Oh, yes. Maybe you were switch-hitting the boy. Or again, I could be right. Maybe you were making it with your secretary. Maybe you did make her pregnant. But one thing I wanna tell you, my friend, I've had enough crap from you! You're not gonna stand there telling me that there's a cripple, who is a hit-and-run driver, and a maniac driving around this city killing the wrong people by mistake. Not me! And I'm gonna tell you something else! My friend, please. You get your strength back and you get your act together because you are gonna need it. The man is sick. Detective Angeli, you have to help me. Well, I'll give it my best shot. Give me a motive for killing you. You owe money? I mean, real money? No. Have you been sleeping around? We know your wife's dead. No. What about your patients? They're disturbed people. Maybe one of them has a grudge. What do you call it, a fixation, psychosis, have you thought of that? - Of course. - And? Well, naturally, it's a possibility. Then tell me who they are and I'll check them out. That I can't do. I thought you wanted help. Try and understand. I am not a dentist or a chiropodist. I deal with people with serious emotional problems. If you start probing and questioning, you'll shatter them. They'd lose all their confidence in me. I'd never, ever be able to treat them. Well, then, we'll just have to go along the way we are, won't we, Doctor? All I can promise you is that I'll keep an open mind. I may not appreciate my partner's tactics all the time but I'm out to nail whoever did it. If you're clean, you got no problem. But if you're not, I'll come down on you just as hard as McGreavy. Judd, I had all your stuff picked up and brought over here. I appreciate it, thanks, Peter. Beats me why you wanna go back so soon. It'll be therapy for me listening to other people's nightmares. Well, this is it. Very nice. Judd, this is Betty. She's gonna sit in for you until you find a permanent replacement. Betty, this is Dr. Stevens. - Good morning, Betty. - Good morning, Dr. Stevens. Now you take good care of him. He's one of the walking wounded. Listen, I'll leave you two alone, okay? - And buzz me if you need anything. - Okay, thanks. I wasn't sure how you wanted to work, Doctor, but I took the liberty of calling your patients and rescheduled their appointments. You did well, thank you. There were one or two I wasn't able to reach yet. Well, keep trying. Who's the first? Miss Skoleman is due in 20 minutes. Thank you. Detective Angeli, please. - Who's calling? - Dr. Stevens. Detective Angeli. Hello, Angeli, look, I'm sorry to worry you, but I had a thought. - What is it? - Zifrin. What about him? Well, could you check whether he's still inside? He's doing life. Well, he could have escaped or been let out on parole. No way, but I'll check it out. Thanks, I'd appreciate it. I'll let you know. - I'll wait to hear from you. - Yeah, okay. I need sex. Like right now, I... I could ball you. I've told you that if you go on talking like that, I can't treat you. So stop treating me. Sometimes it's like a scream inside my head. Like the only thing that can stop it, is a knife, and I... - A knife? - What? A knife. Why did you think of it? Because all the men I've had, all the men I'm gonna have, going inside me, cutting me open. I lied to you, Doctor. I've been lying to you the entire time. Well, it's really not important. It's important to me. You see, there was really no reason for me to consult you, ever. There's nothing worrying me. Everything in my life is perfect. I had to explain, otherwise you might have jumped to the wrong conclusions. Then when I read in the papers about your poor secretary, I felt so badly about that. Why would anyone do such a horrible thing? Well, that's a question a lot of people would like answered. It's almost as if... You see, the reason I came to see you, the reason I took up your time, it... It wasn't for me. I wasn't asking for help. Thank you. I wasn't asking for help for myself. It was for a friend of mine who didn't have the courage to face up to something. Well, I thought maybe I could... Of course I realize now that was really very foolish of me. She's over it now, is she, this friend of yours? - Whatever it was. - What was that? She's over it, your... Your friend? Well, she's moved away, so, yes, I guess she must be. It's difficult to know anyone completely, isn't it? I suppose it is. I seem to have spent most of my life trying to get people to know themselves. Yes, that's what my friend said. Thank you. You see... Well, I can tell you now because it's really academic but my friend stumbled upon something just by accident. Something evil, and it changed her entire life. I think that she began to doubt her own sanity. Is that very unusual, would you say? No, we all have secret doubts, and secret fears. Imagination can lead us up all sorts of blind alleys. But as you said, in the case of your friend, it is happily academic. Still, if she ever needs advice, I'm always available. Well, I've taken up enough of your time. Not at all. I've enjoyed meeting you, Mrs. Blake. Here, let me. No, that's all right. Thank you. And you don't owe me anything. I shall count you as one of my rare successes. Yes, I hope so. Evening, Charlie. Don't worry about the car, I'm going out later. What's happened to Charlie? He's on vacation, Doctor. What do you mean, you charged it? Look, you need a new fur coat like I need herpes. Well, tough. Ninth floor, isn't it, Doctor? I left something in my car. I'll get it. Get in. You heard the man, Doctor. Get in. There's no way I'm gonna pay for another fucking coat. What's wrong with the one you've got? They never killed it, that's what's wrong with it. Fifteen. Listen, I'm telling you, I'm gonna cancel every goddamn credit card you've got. All right, come on, let's go. Shit! - What are you shooting at? - Nothing. - Now what the hell's the matter? - It's cool. Hold it! Is someone sick? Come on, man. There've got to be 50 apartments in this lousy building. I'm still gonna check the elevator. Do it, man. Hurry! Hurry! Come on. - Hide the gun! - What? I think maybe they're coming in here. - Who's coming in here? - Just hide it. No, no, wrong way. Follow me. It's all clear. Let's get out of here. Are you the guys that called us? - Yeah. - Are we in time? - Yeah. - Where is he? - He's in there. - You call the police yet? - No. - All right, do me a favor, will you? Go down and call the police right away. It's very important. I'll take care of it up here. Give me that, come on. Let's go. Bring this through. Come on. Judd. Judd, open up. It's okay, it's me, Peter. Pete? Check outside, will you? Make sure everything's clear. God almighty, you had me scared. You okay? Yeah, I'm fine. God, I'm glad to see you. I heard a shot. I thought the next was for me. I need a drink. Okay, suicide, come on, I'll force brandy down your throat. - Talk to me. - Armed robbery. Two guys. - You get anybody? - No, not yet. - Anybody hurt? - Got somebody upstairs checking on the ninth floor. And surprise, surprise, guess who they were after. - Who? - Dr. Stevens. Maybe there is something to his story after all. I'll believe that if he's dead. Well, the only damn thing I could think of was to make that suicide call, but I never expected you to show up. I just happened to be in emergency when the call came in and I recognized the address. Hey, I didn't do too badly either, you know. I told those phony doormen to call the police. Doctor, there's some activity downstairs. - The cops have just arrived. - Yeah, fine. That doesn't make sense. They did what you told them. No, no. I radioed ahead from the ambulance. Okay, you two can cut now. Thanks a lot. - Sure. - Yes, thank you. - You're welcome. - Cheers. - Lieutenant. - Yes, sir. We found the two real doormen in the storage room. - Dead or alive? - Alive. - Well, that's one point for our side. - Yes, sir. A refill. I'm not gonna get drunk on my own. Hey, hey. That's it. Lieutenant McGreavy. A little early for the wake but in time for a drink, that is if you drink on duty. No, I... I never drink with suspects. See what I mean? Well, this time, Lieutenant, I have witnesses. Witnesses to what? A break-in and an attempt on my life. What was it this time? A midget with a laser beam? There were two men here when my team arrived. I see. Two men. Yes, dressed as doormen. Dressed as doormen. And who are you? My name's Dr. Hadley. And I'm Dr. Stevens' brother-in-law. I see. It's a family affair. Well, since you're a professional man, Doctor, I'm sure you can give us a full description, you can give us the Medicare details, and you can give us the serial number on the guns. There were guns, weren't there? Presumably, yes. Presumably doesn't make conviction. Got a victim, Lieutenant. And a bullet hole in the wall. Well, now, we've got an open and shut case. We've got a blown away teddy bear shot by person or persons unknown, a lot more mystery, and me, I'm not getting anywhere. Now I tell you what we're gonna do. We're gonna go down to the station, and we're gonna look at some mug shots, you see, and my men are gonna tear this place apart and they better come up with something positive. Because if they don't, I wanna tell you in medical terms, both of you are becoming a pain in the ass. Shall we go? Lieutenant. The only thing your department has on me is three unpaid parking tickets. And to the best of my knowledge, Dr. Stevens has not been charged with any crime, so I'll give you a little free medical advice in return. You know, you don't look in good shape to me. You're overweight, you've got liver spots, and your neck gets red when you get angry. So I'd quit threatening if I were you. You want us to accompany you to the police station, all right. Ask politely. Or I'll bounce a complaint on the commissioner's desk so fast, you won't believe it. And for your further information, I delivered the commissioner's wife's last baby and he was very grateful. Boy or girl? Boy. Congratulations. Let's get out of here. Sally, a cup of coffee? And a plain donut. - Get anything? - Nope. Nothing. Nobody's talking. How about you? Did they pick anybody out? Oh, yeah, we got a winner. He's only been jailed for the last 822,000 years. I did come up with one interesting little item though. What was that? Stevens' wife was apparently quite well-heeled. I looked up the newspaper accounts of the car crash that killed her and the daughter. And tucked away in the file were details of her published will. Stevens didn't get anything. In the event of her dying without issue, the entire... - What do you mean, issue? - Childless. The entire estate passed to her brother's children. What do we know about Hadley? I don't know. Why don't you ask the commissioner's wife? Seriously. Should I do some digging? It's worth a shot, isn't it? I don't think we should leave a doctor unturned. Mac, will you take some advice from me? Go easy on Stevens. Too many people know how you feel about the Zifrin trial. Even assuming you're able to put a circumstantial case together, any half-assed lawyer would just throw you out of court. Is that it? Is that the advice? Not entirely. I had a word with the captain about you. What were you doing, protecting your job? No, because I care about you. If you care about me, well, I'll tell you what you can do. You can forget about caring about me, you see, because I can take care of myself. I can take care of Stevens and you know what you can do? You can take care of the fucking check! Excuse me, gentlemen. I was traveling in a train, sitting across from a young man who was reading one of those men's magazines... You know the kind I mean. He tried to engage me in conversation, but I sensed he was being over-familiar. Is this still part of the dream? No. No. The dream came later. This was real. Betty, I don't like to be disturbed when I'm with a patient. Sorry, Doctor. I have a call from Ann Blake. She says it's urgent. I'll be right out. Miss Graham, excuse me a moment. - Line two, Doctor. - Okay. Hello. Mrs. Blake, Dr. Stevens. Doctor, I know I shouldn't disturb you but this is important. I've seen that friend of mine again, and she wants me to tell you that she wasn't wrong. That there is something evil. Terribly evil. Which puts you in danger. Well, what sort of danger? Mrs. Blake, why don't you come over here and we can talk about it? No, I'm afraid that I... I can't. I'm afraid that's impossible. I'll try and ring you again. Wait a minute, Mrs. Blake. Mrs. Blake! Mrs. Blake. I wanna thank you for caring for me because they just took me off the Stevens case. Angeli! Come in here, will you? Mac, I really am sorry. Fuck you. You Mr. Morgens? Are you Mr. Morgens? Are you the Dr. Stevens that made the appointment? I am. Who recommended me? Well, nobody, exactly. I got your name out of the yellow pages. So I recommended me. Like I say, never knock the power of advertising. Come on in. You medical or philosophical? I'm a psychoanalyst. There's a couch over there. You can lie down if you'll feel more at home. Tell me all your problems. You drink coffee? No, thanks. I'm sorry, I'd be wasting your time. I made a mistake. It's gonna cost you though. Like in your racket, you got to pay for cancellations. Okay. How much? Minimum charge. $50. - $50? - More... More if you like. I'm not proud. On the other hand, now that you've parted with the bread, why don't you at least get an opinion? You're entitled. Got to say, I can't promise whether I'm gonna tell you you've got hemorrhoids but maybe I can diagnose something a little more personal. Why don't you sit down? Right in that chair. There's not a cat on that chair, is there? Same color. Now... Now then. What is it? Money or women? Like I always say, take away them two, and you got most of the problems of the world solved right off. Don't be put off by the decor, I know it's not House & Garden but I mostly deal with people that are down. I like to make them feel easy. I haven't got the fanciest place in the world here, I don't have a pretty little secretary with a cute little butt prancing around but I've been around a few years. I know a trick or two. And I sure as hell can give you the right time. I think... I think somebody's trying to murder me. What reason could anybody have to do a thing like that, Doc? I have no idea. As far as I know, I have no enemies to speak of. - Are you married? - No. I have to ask this. Are you a fairy? My wife is dead. I'm sorry to hear that. Do you owe anybody any money? Look, Mr. Morgens, I have been through all of this with the police. Well, I imagine so. Only difference is you're paying me. What about your patients, Doc? Most of your patients are loonies, right, Doc? If you're talking clinically, no. Seems to me most people are crazy today. Take your coffee straight? I don't want any, thanks. Well, you can't catch it off a cracked cup, you know. Now the way I see it, is the first thing we have to do is to find out whether somebody's actually trying to knock you off or whether you're nuts yourself. Now, which of the boys in blue have you been dealing with? A Lieutenant McGreavy and a Detective Angeli. Now, to come clean with you, I must tell you that I read the papers, too. So you're not exactly unfamiliar to me. Now one of the first things we have to do is find out if there's a game in progress. Then we'll find out who the players are. And you're gonna take a little vacation. - A vacation? - Yeah, immediately. Tomorrow morning. No, no, no. That's impossible. I... I've got regular patients scheduled. Well, cancel them. Cancel them. First thing you do when you leave here is go straight home. Book yourself in a nice, quiet place in the country. Call the cops, tell them that you've been called out of town on an emergency case, you'll be gone for a week or so. I don't want them hunting for you while you're gone. By the way, I think you're gonna have to give me a couple of big ones for a retainer. Minus the $50 you already gave me. These damn clocks are expensive to run, you know. I got to get a special kind of oil for them and everything. - $150. - Thank you. Tell me what's going on. I feel like I've been reading too much Raymond Chandler. We're rolling for high stakes, Mac. The man has a lot of friends in town. That's why I had to take you off the case. You played it too rough. Yeah, but I want him to think I have a grudge. It's the only way we're gonna save our necks, it's the only way we can win. We got to play it that way. I've been thinking. If you were to resign from the force, it would be in character. Is that what you're asking? Might help. He might think the pressure was off. Might make him get careless. Let's talk it over. Don't turn it. Just step out of the car. Damn it, Mr. Morgens. Don't ever do that again. Forgive me, Doc. I enjoy a little theatrics now and then. You know what intrigued me about your problem, Doc? Seems like every five minutes, somebody's trying to pull the curtains on you. Come here, I wanna show you something. You wanna release the hood for me, please? Open it up gently. Good thing I'm a bad sleeper. I got here around midnight. That was done before that. Rigged up two ways, too, just to make sure. That little mother would have cut short your vacation. Not that you was ever gonna take one. That was just appetizer. You know, I always say, you wanna catch a shark, you got to bloody up the water first. Well, it ain't all that bad. Made some progress. Found out two things. What are those? Well, first we know that you're not a basket case. And second, we know that somebody is God almighty anxious to shut your mouth. Now, let's put this little baby safe in my car and then we'll go out and grab some breakfast. I don't know about you, but sleepless nights always give me one hell of an appetite. Easy does it. Now then, are we dealing with some homicidal maniac or have we got something deeper going on here? I guess something deeper, Mr. Morgens. Two men came to my apartment. I could go along with the theory of one homicidal maniac but two working together, that I can't buy. Okay, you're the doctor. Why? Well, because although a deranged mind has an obsession, it almost invariably works to a definite pattern. Now, if it was one man, and there were going to be other murders after Boyd and my secretary, then the first time he failed to kill me, he would have moved to the next one on the list. But that didn't happen. Somebody's been concentrating on me. And there were two men. Got you. Now then, tell old Norman Z this. Did you have any secret that was common to Boyd and your secretary? You know, something that only you three knew about? No. I never discussed patient with patient or patient with secretary. What about families? What do you mean, families? Well, when you take on a patient, do you interview the family? Very rarely. In most cases, the relatives aren't even aware that I've been consulted. That could be it. All right, it's your beehive, you're the keeper of the honey. Now I'll tell you what I want you to do. Go right back to your office, run down your computer records. Only do me a favor. Don't read them like a doctor. Read them like a detective. And look for something at least little bit offbeat. - Okay. - One more thing. Bury your lifestyle. Break all the molds. You have a gun? No, I don't believe in them. I don't believe in Santa Claus. He still comes around every Christmas. That was rather a short vacation, Doctor. Yes. Well, they tried again last night. They planted a bomb in my car. That ought to convince McGreavy. McGreavy's been taken off this case. I'm running it now. Is that the car you're talking about? No, I exchanged it. Morgens thought it would be a good idea. Morgens? Who the hell is Morgens? A man I hired. What sort of a man? A private investigator. There's one born every minute. What do you think we're here for? Okay, it's your money. Get back to the bomb. Where is it? Morgens has it. He dismantled it, and before you say anything else, if it weren't for him, I wouldn't be here right now. Yeah? How did you get on to this Sherlock? I... I found him in the yellow pages. You know, for a smart shrink, you're not too bright. You find plumbers in the yellow pages, not life insurance. What do you know about him? I know I trust him. Doctor, the only person in the world you should trust right now is me. Look, the fact that I picked Morgens at random must weigh in his favor. I mean, he couldn't possibly be connected with this at all, could he? Do you mind if we continue this inside? I feel a little conspicuous out here. Morgens also thought it would be a good idea if I made myself scarce for a while. He said it would smoke them out. - And then he found the bomb for you? - Yes. - And that's why you trust him? - Yes. Didn't that ever cross your mind? - Good morning, Betty. - Dr. Stevens, I didn't expect to see you today. - Any messages? - No, just some disappointed patients. No calls. What I'm trying to say is, didn't it ever occur to you that this Morgens character might have planted the bomb himself? - Why would he? - Why? Just to win your confidence. I mean, you've got to be an expert to handle high explosives. We're not talking Fourth of July firecrackers. I think it's very unlikely. Everything about this goddamn case is unlikely. But I'll tell you one thing. Whoever is behind it can afford to pay your private detective a hell of a lot more than you can. Okay, you do nothing without contacting me, okay? I'm not Lieutenant McGreavy, remember? I happen to be on your side despite everything. I'm gonna leave you my home number. You do understand I had to do something. Yeah, what's done is done. But don't keep me in the dark. I can't help you if you go off on your own. And whatever you do, please don't meet Morgens alone again without me, okay? All right, if you say so. Okay. You're a taxpayer, right? Get your money's worth. Hello. Yes. Morgens? Where are you? Never mind that. I told you I had a hunch. And I was right. I know who killed Boyd and the girl. Now, if you wanna know why you're next, Doctor, we've got to meet and talk. So come alone. Couldn't we meet here at the hospital? That safe enough? No, I was followed. But I think I've managed to shake them. Meet me at the end of Navy Pier as soon as you can. Come alone. Are you sure you really know? I'm dead sure. Have you ever heard of Don Vinton? Just get there. Don Vinton? - Yeah, hello? - Angeli. - Who's that? - It's me, Stevens. - You got some news? - Yes, Morgens just contacted me. - He says he has the answer. - Does he? Wants me to meet him at the end of Navy Pier. - Where you calling from? - I'm still at the hospital. I'll pick you up right away. You take that. Well, this is the end of Navy Pier. Where the hell is he? Morgens! Mr. Morgens! Come here. Morgens! Dr. Stevens, this is a murder investigation, not some stupid game you can play according to your own rules. Three people have died horribly, Doctor. You tell me that you have evidence. Well, let me tell you something. I've applied for a court order to force you to give us that information. I am not prepared to pussyfoot around any longer. - What about the name Morgens gave me? - What about it? Well, he said he knew. He said the man we were after is Don Vinton. Why aren't you looking for him? Read him the list. We checked every Vinton in the Chicago area. There are 11. We narrowed those down to four possibles... No, five. One's bedridden and blind. Then there's a priest, there's a bank president who's been on vacation in Switzerland for a month, and a fireman who was on duty during two of the murders, and an 82-year-old person who runs a pet shop. And we've also put a tap out to the FBI. They also drew a blank. Maybe you heard it wrong or maybe he was kidding. Who knows? I did not mishear him. And I still believe him. For God's sakes, Morgens is dead! Well, I owe him that at least. Now, I have business to attend to. And I suggest you attend to yours. I'll be in prison if you want me. I do a clinic there every week. Keep tabs on him around the clock. I intend to. By the way, is it true that McGreavy resigned? He turned in his resignation. I'm sitting on it. Fallon comes up for parole on the 13th of next month. His lawyer seems to think he has a pretty good chance. He seems rational enough these days. Hasn't given us any trouble lately. Can I ask you a question? - About Fallon? - No. Not about Fallon. Have you ever heard of anybody called Don Vinton? Sure. You know somebody of that name? Sure. Do you know where I can find him? You were probably looking at him. He's here. There, yeah, there he is. See that guy standing over there by the wall? That's our Don Vinton. He's doing life. Five counts of first-degree murder. Know his specialty? He used to nail guys to the floor by their scrotums, pour paraffin all around it, and light it. He boasted that he always gave them a choice. But you said, "our Don Vinton." What does that mean? Well, you see, it's a nickname. Every jail has one. It's Italian for "big man." Like here. I'm the Don Vinton. Hey, Angeli! Phone! Line two. Give him a call and let me know. All right. I'll take it over there. Angeli. Say that again. I said I know who Don Vinton is. Except it's nobody. It's just an expression, an Italian nickname. Well, that's why you all drew a blank. It means the top man. Are you saying it's the family? Well, it has to be. It fits in with what Morgens said. He was convinced the killings were being done by more than one man, by an organization. Because if you're only half right, you are in big trouble. Where are you? I'm in a bar, it's called Georgia's, and it's on the corner of Franklin and Kinsey. Stay there. Have a lot of people around you. I'm on my way. - Come on, let's get out of here. - Yeah. It was smart of you to figure that out, Doctor. Well, I just got lucky. Yeah. Where are we going? I'm putting you in a safe house under protection until we get this thing sorted out. So this is what a safe house looks like. You know, for a smart shrink, you don't pull down too much psychology. You trusted the wrong cop. At last I have the pleasure of meeting the famous Dr. Stevens. Forgive me for having you brought to me in this unconventional fashion. But it was necessary for me to ask you a few personal questions. Sit down. My name is Cortini, as I'm sure you know. No, why should I? You've been seeing my wife as a patient. I have no patient by that name. Maybe you know her by her maiden name, Blake. Ann Blake. Ann Blake is your wife? Yes. Shall we not play games here, Doctor? You're not here to act the innocent. And I know my wife has been consulting you, now what I don't know, what I need to find out is why. Why, Doctor? Your wife came to me for the usual professional reasons. What are they? In my work, I come into contact with people with a variety of emotional problems. What? Emotional problems? Yes, in basic terms. And what exactly, notice I said exactly, were my wife's emotional problems, Doctor? Non-existent, as far as I could tell. I can't betray any professional confidence, but I can assure you that in my opinion, she has no serious condition. You can assure me of that, can you? We're not making any progress here. Let me explain. If you don't betray what you call a professional confidence, I'm gonna have things done to you, you wouldn't believe. Now I know she paid you three visits. Three separate visits. That seems excessive if she had no emotional problems worth speaking of, wouldn't you say? Some patients merely want the comfort of talking. All right. What did she talk about? Did she talk about me? Only obliquely. All she ever said about you was that you were in the construction business. Are you sure she didn't say the demolition business? You're not trying, Doctor. You notice he's not trying? Maybe you're trying too hard, maybe you're trying to be smart. Which is it? Your wife said nothing that would in any way embarrass you. Unfortunately, that's not something I can take on trust. You're a dead man, Doctor, whichever way you tell it. But you could save her. See, I have a certain code by which I live. Anybody who betrays that code, betrays the family to which I belong, they pay the price. Personal considerations don't come into it. No matter how close the relationship. You follow me? I have no idea what you're talking about. He doesn't know. He has no idea, this smart, $50 shrink. It never entered his head he was treating the wife of a capo. And that even the nothing she told you was too much! Operator, get me the police. Put... - Captain. - Yes? I don't know whether it's important, but an operator just took an emergency call from a woman in the Lake Forest area. She hung up before she got any details or a trace. So, what am I supposed to do about it? Put an ad in the newspaper? No, sir. Where were we? Bertelli. Yeah, thanks. Great! McGreavy's tracked something. Put out a code 10. All cars. Ruboff! Weaver! Let's go! Mac thinks Angeli and the mob are heading for Demarco's plant. So tell the SWAT team to move ass. I want the whole area saturated and have the house surrounded, too. Well, journey's end, huh, Tony? Well, yeah, which reminds me. We've got to find someplace to hide you away until this thing blows over. Do you have a preference? Well, I kind of like the music in Jamaica. You got it. I thought you might like to take a look at the legitimate side of my business, Doctor. I deal in garbage. Human garbage. Everything that Chicago rejects. The sacred and profane debris of a million lives, it all finds its way here, Doctor. You deal with their minds, I handle the excretion of their plastic existence. Look at it this way, Doctor. A heap of discarded ideals, lost hopes, old loves, all find their way here eventually to be carried along this conveyor, to the last mouth that will taste them. I'm sure you will appreciate the poetic justice of such an arrangement, Doctor, being a sensitive man like myself. As a matter of fact, the only difference between you and me is that you still believe that human nature is basically good. Whereas, I have no doubt that human nature is basically corrupt. Aren't I right, my friend? No, don't! Don't! God, please... Don't! No, don't. Sorry, my friend, rogue cops are always a liability with very limited uses. Don't! Please. Don't. Please don't. Don't do this. Don't shoot. Just close the door. You must find it incredible, Doctor, that your life is about to end simply because the wrong woman walked through your door. Right out of the blue. A little puttana of a wife got scared, told you all our little domestic secrets. For the last time, your wife told me nothing. But I can't rely on that, you have to appreciate my position. How much do you earn a year, Doctor, listening to all that garbage? Fifty, 75 grand? I earn that much in one day! I must protect myself. I deal with reality, not dreams, Doctor! Let him go, Frank. I deal in hard currency. One rogue policeman, a wife, a $50 shrink. Frank. Come on! Come on, psychoanalyst. What isn't disposable is the life I've made. Put them down! Come on, move out! - Get an ambulance in here! - Come on, move it! Come on, hurry up! Move it! That's a hell of a way to treat a taxpayer. I was told I could always find you here on Wednesdays. Who told you that? Your sister-in-law. I'm Dr. Hadley's patient. He never told me. I asked him not to. Are you all right now? Yes. I'm fine. And you? I wanted to say I'm sorry. Why should you be sorry? I was the cause of everything, wasn't I? If I hadn't consulted you, you wouldn't have been involved, and none of those people would have died. I'm told you're not practicing anymore. No. I'm... I'm writing a book on the nature of the criminal mind. I still make my prison visits but I don't have private patients anymore. Does that now mean you're now allowed to socialize with ex-patients? What did you have in mind? Something risky, like a cup of coffee. Well, I... I don't think I would get struck off for that. So, my devious sister-in-law told you where to find me, did she? You know, she has certain theories about me. Is she accurate? I don't know. Maybe you'll find out over a coffee. I might even let you analyze me. After all, you were one of my rare successes. Bastards!
