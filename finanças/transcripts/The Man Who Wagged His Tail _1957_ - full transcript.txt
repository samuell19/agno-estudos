The Man Who Wagged His Tail An angel went through Brooklyn for me. And I heard him talking to me like a friend. His laughs gave me life. His arms offered me warmth. So did you see the hard punishment That I had to undergo? "Yes, people, Italians do live here, this is Brooklyn. Emigration winds brought to New York this piece of land pulled from Italy. Italian signs and surnames are in most stores. Daunted by the skyscrapers' shadows, the newcomers feel at ease in this neighbourhood until, little by little, they lose their fear and end up dispersing though the rest of the big city to become Americans. It has always been like this. " A tale, a beautiful tale. A nickel. The little bird chooses it. A tale of fairies, of witches, of enchanted princes. But, Rosina, where do you want me to go? I cross five streets and I meet people who speak Polish. Two streets that way, and they speak Chinese, German, Czech, black... - And who understands them? - But over there, in downtown. - By the skyscrapers. - Over there is much worse. They speak English, American. - So, was it worth it coming here? - Don't complain. - We are not worse off than before. - I'll come back soon. "Goodbye", Toto. Buy a tale from me! Five cents! A tale to make you happy. What would make me happy is having $ 10,000 in the bank. Wait, wait. Here, and may God be with you. And what do I do with this? Give it to a child. Hey, listen! Children... Children no longer believe in tales. "And here the illusion is complete. It seems that we are back in Naples. It's not just the people, it's even this house, built perhaps by a Neapolitan many years ago. There have been so many of them in North America ... Its patio, its galleries, its stairs and its apartments they all shelter a bustling world where is no place for nostalgia because everything is the same as in the distant homeland. Thanks to this big building, they all feel more confident and live happy and relaxed. " Here! That will teach you not to come home at midnight! - Is this the country of freedom? - America has gone to your head! Go inside, and don't think so much about pants! - What happened? - Did you win the lottery? Today is a holiday! Today they are taking Tonino to the hospital! There he is, there he is! Today they are removing the cast! Today his leg will be freed! Giulia, come down! Come and take care of the pot! I must take care of Do?a Teresa's child! - Then come with the child! - Giulia! Come, come down here! Come on! We have to organize a race when we come back! A race? He will have to be careful for at least three days. - Three days? At least fifteen! - Don't scare him. Giulia, are you also coming to the hospital? - Are you afraid of being hurt? - I'm not scared. Then, go to the hospital with mom. I get the soup ready. You'll be hungry when you come back... Let's go! Let's go! You're singing, huh? You're laughing. Everyone looks happy and content. Apparently, you all have money to pay the rent tomorrow. That's great. I'm glad. - Goodbye, my child. - See you later, grandpa. - Mr. Bossi ... - I talk business in the office, ma'am. Mr. Lawyer. Tomorrow we have to pay the rent, but you know that my husband is sick and can't work. Couldn't you wait a little more? Contracts have been invented to avoid discussions. If I give you an extension, you will owe me money later, but since you owe it to me now, I can't grant it to you. If you don't intend to honour the contract, I will be forced to evict you. The tenant must arrange for repairs of broken pipes at his own expense. I give you three days to settle with the plumber. - Did you hear me? - Well, I pay the rent but the house is yours. Why should I pay for repairs? Because it is written in the contract that you signed. I haven't learned English as yet, why didn't you translate it for me then? Because I am a lawyer, not an English teacher. But listen ... Why are you waiting to sit down? You have nothing to do? It was out of respect. I only need three seconds of respect. I don't pay you for bowing. Excuse me, Mr. Lawyer, if I may remind you... - What? - Nothing, it's nothing, but, since you deduct five dollars for breakfast, and this morning you apparently forgot... It's almost lunch time. However, fair is fair. Who would give you roast beef for breakfast? - These are your dinner's leftovers. - What? Another reason not to whine. If I've eaten it, you can be sure it's good. Eating during office hours? Where's the tailor's file? The tailor is sick. And I thought that... I'm paying you to work, not to think. Tell the tailor that if he does not pay before eight o'clock, I will request an eviction order. I'm going to open the safe. The last documents about Miss Giulia's inheritance have arrived. - Huh? - That poor orphan. I don't what to hear about orphans. She has befriended all the neighbours. Here. But you assured her that as soon as the last documents arrived, you would give her the 6,000 dollars inheritance. Miss Giulia is here by herself, and, according to the law... Huh? Just a moment! I don't admit lessons in my profession. Off course the law protects that girl, - and I will pay her the 6,000 dollars. - Oh When she turns 20. Now she would waste the money. My duty is to follow her uncle's will to the letter. Clause nine gives me certain powers. I read it too, but... I don't remember. Are you suggesting ...? You, a mere intern, are suggesting that I, a doctor of law, am lying? Listen! If a single word of this conversation reaches her or of any other person's ears, I'll take you to court for breach of professional secrecy! Is that clear? Yes. Yes, Mr. Lawyer. But I just said what people say. And what do I care about what others say? This house is full of incompetents. Bah! "O sole mio"! They spend their time badmouthing me, that bunch of bums. They waste their time laughing and singing. Have you ever seen me singing or laughing? - No. - No, for I am a serious person. I work like a donkey, while they... I suppose you will know the fable of the cicada and the donkey. - And the ant .... - The donkey! Don't be an ignorant. Go. Bark. I said "bark". You must bark properly. You must compress the diaphragm. Pay attention. You will never learn Ridiculous. You must do something for us. I'm not asking that the lawyer dies or suffers a serious illness, but a good strong cold could rid us of him. At least for this month. Hey, Alfonso. You still here? Does one need a passport to be in this neighbourhood? No passport is needed, but I would like to know what are you up to for the two months you have been in my district. - I'm doing nothing. Absolutely nothing. - That's the point. I don't like those who don't do anything. In this neighbourhood some people do honest work, some other steal, and some others sell booze without a licence. There is also some illegal gambling. Everyone does something. I know all that, and in the end everything gets fixed. But I don't like those who do nothing. - But I... - Shut up. Anything you say will be something stupid. Leave ... if you don't want me to embark you. In short, why do you want me to leave? Personal dislike. Bah! She's inside. Thank you, that's very kind of you. May I go in? - My place is your place. - Thank you. - Are you not kissing me? - Oh, Alfonso! - You come here, I can't leave. - Hi. Every day I see you with a new child. If I can help all these busy people... Sure, and you become everybody's servant. There you are, cooking for others. Grandpa and Paolina are so good to me... At first we didn't know each other. However, they treat me as a relative. And they don't want even a penny. Here. You are a very good woman. I love you a lot, and I can't see my girlfriend working all day as a maid. Any news about those Naples documents? - Oh yes.. They have arrived. - So, what are you waiting for? The lawyer hasn't called me yet. You think the lawyer will deliver home the 6,000 dollars? You must talk to him and insist. I just had a great opportunity. A bar lease in downtown. In downtown, do you understand? In the skyscrapers area. It was a good opportunity. Exactly 6,000 dollars. Pietrino! What are you doing? I want a door painted in white, not an artistic painting. OK, very well. The door is yours, I'm an idiot, and it's your money. Here it is. Is that how you want it? Giulia! Wait here for me. Good morning, Bruno. How are you doing? - Mr. Bruno ... - Miss Giulia ... I've told the lawyer about the inheritance. Bruno! - See you later. - See you later. Nice guy.. Yes, and he has promised to help me with the inheritance. He will help you, sure he will. Well, you have half an hour for lunch. Eh .... no, 28 minutes. A table for four? Oh, no. I am by myself. I always come alone and sit at that table. You are new here, right? I always come alone and I don't pay. I am the property owner. Tell your boss that the lawyer is here, he will understand. The menu. Hey, lady, hold your dog! Sorry, I don't like dogs. Well, is this restaurant for people or for dogs? She will put him a plate, I suppose. Those people with dogs ... It's the last time I'm coming here! Hello, Tonino. - Can I go and play? - Yes. - Yes. You go. - But no running! I was charged $3 at the hospital. We can't even make a pizza to celebrate it. Papa, no pizzas. Did you forget about him? The rent is due tomorrow. What shall we do? Yeah, sure. This month we are, let's say, with the water up to our necks. - How was the operation? - They gave me a candy. - To make you sleep? - No, to eat it. And after that? Then, they took something that did like that. Does it hurt? No. It feels like new. So what now? Who are the gangsters? - I'm Jesse James. - And I the sheriff. - And what do I do? - You can't run, you play dead. Always the dead one, always the dead one. Even when I was good I had to be the dead one. - You are too small. -You are either the corpse or nothing. OK, I'll be the dead one, but without dying right away. - Hi. - Good day. Let's see... This one. I think I'll like it. Here! It's ready! These are delicious. Bye.. That's cheating! You can't shoot because you're dead! Charge! My cake! You scoundrels! Bandits! You scoundrels! Watch out! It's the lawyer! - He's hitting Tonino! - He'll kill him! It was the lawyer! I saw it! - He slapped him! - I... - You scoundrel! - He is a sick child! - What happened? - That boy! Who did it? I saw with my own eyes how he punched him! I was on my way home when... Hitting a poor sick child! He's not happy hurting just adults. - Now he hurts children too! - He wanted to kill a child! Leave me alone, you animals! - The kids were throwing stones at me! - You animal! - Let's kill him! - Yes, we have must hang this usurer! He broke a boy's legs! You threw him to the ground and kicked him! I saw it! They've killed a child! They've killed a child! Go inside! Close the door! Inside! You are so calm while they almost killed me! Mr. Lawyer ... They've been awaiting this opportunity for years! Damn murderers! Mr. Bossi, I don't know anything. What happened? Scoundrels! Indecent mob! We'll see who laughs last. Everyone is against me. They wanted to kill me! There have been threats! It has been a collective aggression. And premeditated, that is ... - a masses crime, that's it. - But ... Anyone who threatens with violence or death or ill-treatment ... to a person or several ... Death... Five years' imprisonment. I will lay charges. I'll charge them with attempted homicide, premeditation and treachery and attempted lynching. I will request a group trial. I will ruin all of them. - And you will be a witness! - But, Mr. Lawyer... You saw and heard everything. Call the police! - But I didn't ... - Call the police! I want protection from the authorities! And you will be plaintiff's witness! Ha! I will teach you. If they think they can play with me... A beautiful tale. Five cents for a tale. I know it's you who's barking, bad man. May you bark for your entire life. May you keep barking until you find someone who loves you. Actually, nothing special happened. Death threats, but you know how things are. How many times have I said to someone: "I'll kill you"? You say it but you don't do it. Everyone was a little worked-up. - Good morning, Mr. Thomas. - When are you getting married? - Soon, soon. - Very well. I don't want to influence on you. The lawyer will explain it to you. You'll see. He is unharmed. Come in. Mr. Lawyer. Mr. Law ... Mr. Lawyer! Yes, Mr. Lawyer! But where is he? I've heard him barking. - What? Does the lawyer bark? - Yes. Eh, no. Does that dog bite? What dog? We don't have a dog here. And that one? I don't know him. Is the lawyer here or not? No, I don't think so. He was here. I don't understand ... Are you trying to tell me that he has been kidnapped? The lock is intact. It has no sign of violence. He may have left for a moment. - His suit is here! - He may wear another one. - He only has another one! - He must be wearing it! - And the dog? - Ah, it's yours ... No! As you wish. But I warn you, anyone who has a dog must declare it and pay for the license. Tell the lawyer! See you next time! Sergeant! Sergeant! Mr. Lawyer... How could this have happened? You can't talk, Mr. Lawyer. But can you understand what I say? That's good. Do you want me to call a doctor? No .... understood. And ... what do we do now? Ah yes. We had agreed to see the judge. I could go if you want me to. You'd better stay here. OK, OK .... as you wish. - Good Morning. - Good Morning. - Eh... - Do you have an appointment? Yes, here Mr. Bo... I mean, Mr. Bossi has an appointment with the judge for today . - Has the dog also been summoned? - Eh, no. - The dog can't come in. - Yes, sure ... Look, it's a matter of five minutes ... please. He will stay here. Hey! Hey! Hey! Get out! Get out! Get out of here! Get ..... Ignacio Gallo hasn't paid the rent for two months, We gave him notice eight days ago. The lawyer wants to proceed with eviction. - Tomorrow. - Another eviction? But what does Bossi win by evicting people? He doesn't get paid and he commits an evil deed. Well, Bruno, I want to tell you something. I'm glad you came alone. Unlike your boss, I think you are a good guy. Between you and I, he is a scoundrel! What's the matter? Are you not feeling well? These people are not settled in the country as yet, but they are honest, hard workers. Obviously, they are a bit out of their environment and we should help them. Do you think that evicting them is the way to help them? In a nutshell, do we give an extension to this poor Ignacio Gallo? Well, I see that an agreement can be reached with you. You are humane and more understanding than your boss. Well, let's see... So, one month's extension? An extension is granted... I didn't want to, but... What did you say? You don't want to? Yes, one month's extension. What is that? - How did he get in? - He came with me. With you? Why did you to come to court with a dog? - Get him out. - He won't leave. He won't leave? I meant to say that I'm leaving, too, so we're leaving together. My apologies, and thank you for Gallo's. How did you become fond of such an ugly dog? He's not mine. Oh, it's the lawyer's, right? Yes, it looks like him. Take it away. Let's go. Sit down, Mr. Lawyer. Sit down .... and pay attention. Well, now let's talk seriously. Something incredible has happened to you, I'm not saying that it could not happen to other people, but in fact, in the last few centuries, and as far as I know, there are no records of a similar event. I believe that these events do not happen unless for some serious reason. In this case, we can guess what the reason is. Listen, I wanted to tell you this more than once. Mr. Lawyer, too many injustices have been committed. Don't argue with me, there's no doubt. If you have been converted into a dog, that serious reason does exist. You have always behaved badly. You must change. You can repair the damage you have done, You must be good, Mr. Lawyer, You must try to help people, I say this for your sake. Today we gave an extension to Ignacio Gallo, let's continue, let's do other good deeds ... and soon. For example, with Miss Giulia's inheritance. Just a moment. Now we will open the safe. You will give me the combination, I won't touch anything, you have my word of honor. I'll say the numbers and when I get to the right one, kindly ... bark at me. Got it? Let us start. One .... two ..... three ..... four ....., five .... six .... seven... Don't get distracted, please! Eight .... nine .... zero. Watch out, Mr. Lawyer, I warned you, you must change. It's not fair to steal money from orphans! We must open the safe right now! Let's see. When you hear the right number, you bark. One, two, three, four... Oh, no? This means that, despite everything, you're still a monster. A scoundrel both as a man and as a dog, a hopeless damned scoundrel! I have no right to change destiny. You became a dog, and now you will be a dog. A stray dog. Get out! Get out of here! Get out, get out of here! Get out! Get out! Get out! Get out of here! Help! Stay away ... pooch. Aren't you a good dog, my little thing? Here, have this. Come, have this. - That dog, grab that dog! - What's going on? - Dammit. - What's going on? Nothing ... Look, look, what a cute doggie. How are you? Dog! Dog! Dog, puppy.... Come here. Don't be afraid, I won't hurt you. Why are you so sad? You haven't eaten ... Wait. That's not enough. You are very hungry. Let's see, wait here. I want a bone! This one. That's a broth bone. It's a good one. - Are you going to pay for it? - I have no money. OK, but you'll have to pay me somehow. Paid! Here. Look what I brought you. Don't you want it? Here, it's good, eat it! You like it, huh? Madam ... Don't let the child play with that dog, he's dangerous and could bite him. My God .... Tonino! Tonino, come here! Leave that dog, it's going to bite you! He doesn't bite, mom, he's hungry! Come here, I told you to leave it! Did you hear me? He doesn't bite, he's good. Do as I say, Tonino! Come here right now! I'll look later for you. Yes, my darling, let's go home. Don't you worry, come here. The lawyer is a punctual man, he's always been here by 8 AM. I won't pay him if he is late today. Sure, you are dreaming. - He must be sick. - He must have left. Yes, but where to? He's gone, he's gone, Bruno said so! Maybe he committed suicide! Why would he commit suicide? Maybe he looked in the mirror and saw how ugly he was... As you wish, but what will we do when the lawyer is back? If God is fair, the lawyer will never come back. Thank you, my Virgin. Thank you very much. Tonino! Where are you going? First you must eat. Here. Tonino! I told you to stay away from that dog! OK. Come on, let's go, let's go. This is a great place. Nobody will bother us here. What do we play? Look. Go fetch it. You're such a fool. Look. Go. Bring it to me! Good! Give it to me! Drop it! Give it to me! Let go of it, you bandit! Come on, dog! Here, let's fight! Come here! You can't defeat me! Take this! I'm stronger than you! No, no, no, if it is due there is no extension; and if there is an extension, then it is not due. Thank you very much, Bruno. You are a great guy. - Good Morning. - Miss Giulia. I wanted to ask you if you could get one month's extension for Mr. Pietrino They've had so many expenses with the child's leg... - Yes, but... - They won't take anything from me. I have five dollars, but they won't take them, and I sleep and live with them. I should help them... The lawyer has given Pietrino two months' extension. The lawyer? You are the one with a good heart. Oh, don't say that. Excuse me, I'll carry that. Thank you, don't bother. I'm just going across the street for bread. Goodbye and thank you. Bye, see you later. Giulia, what did he say? - I've told him about Mr. Pietrino. - I was talking about the inheritance. What can he do if the lawyer is not here? OK, OK, I'll wait for you. This toast is to all who have participated in tonight's party. 100 years of good health! But let's not forget the person who, unknowingly, is delighting us with all this grace from God. Also a toast to Lawyer Bossi who has forgotten that today is rental collection day. (ALL) Long live! Think also of Mr. Bruno, he has been so good ... Of course, Bruno has been very good. The poor thing is still working. I'll bring him two good pizzas. Don't you bother, Mr. Pietrino, Giulia will do it. You go, OK? And when my mother died, the nuns took care of me, and I grew up with them. It must be sad to be an orphan so young. Better being alone than with the wrong people. It's ready. Let's see. It's no longer tight. Did you buy me this suit? She bought it for you and she's not rich. - It was an inexpensive piece of cloth. - So why did you buy it for me? Because you are a good boy, and I want to see you happy. You are also good, so who's buying you things to make you happy? Nobody, for now. My husband will, once I marry. You see? You look spiffy. Go and let the bride see you. When I grow up I'll marry Giulia. For now ensure that you grow up. I don't like the music. Tonino, do you want to play with us? (IRONIC) Sure, to play dead... - How proud he's become. - He's wearing a new suit. - He won't even reply. - That's not a boy, it's a mannequin. - You look so spiffy. - Who is your tailor? - There is a wrinkle. - That's easy to fix, like this. I am going to kill you! So weren't you going to kill me? We'll settle when I catch you alone. You like sweets, huh? When I grow up I'll buy that whole tray. Giulia bought me one once. I'll give you some too. Let's go. Oh, the bone. I almost forgot. Today it's not very big, you know? Any news about the lawyer? He hasn't returned. Mr. Bruno is the only one. It will be very easy to get from him your $6,000. - You think so? Why? - Don't you see he is after you? Sorry, what do you mean? Haven't you seen how he greets you? "Good morning, Miss Giulia." - He is very kind. - That fool is in love. In love? - I haven't noticed. - Try visiting him. Pretend you're in love with him and he'll surely release the dough - What are you saying? - He'll give you the money! I can't do that, I'm your girlfriend and that would be a lie. You're right, I was joking. But you should convince him that your happiness depends on him. But without telling him about us. Now that you're telling me, it doesn't seem right to do such a thing. Well, do as you wish, it's your money ... You're dead! Don't move, you're dead. I beg you, my happiness depends on that money. I'm going to get married and he will have to leave if I don't have it. You are ... going to get married? Yes. I'll open the safe with a consent order from the courts. Relax, I'll take care of it, tomorrow at the latest. I'll get it as soon as I can. I'm very sorry. Never mind. You will have your money. Now leave me alone. I must review some files. - Hi, Alf, the usual? - No, nothing right now. He will open the safe with the Police's permission, - you can pack the suitcases. - If I had packed every time you told me... This time is for real, I even have the papers. To marry me? No, I marry her as soon as they give us the money. - What novelty is that? - Listen, you leave it to me, I don't want to end in jail for $ 6,000. If I marry her I own the dough because I'm her husband. Got it? Then you and I leave and my wife can ask for the divorce ... if she finds me. - Is this one of your tricks? - My word of honour. After the wedding you will wait for me in a cab with the suitcases. I hope you haven't lost your mind for that stupid girl. Don't be a fool. By the way, can you lend me some money for the expenses? I'm starting to get tired of these advances. Here. It's the last time, huh? Hey! What are you doing here? Get out! Go! Sssshhh .... Don't scream. In view of Lawyer Bossi's unjustified and prolonged absence, I, the judge, at the request of the interested party, have authorized the safe to be opened in presence of the Law witnesses and with the office substitute's full consent Mr. Bruno Lobanco. Is that right? - Ready? - Proceed Don't push, stand back! You can't go inside. - What are they doing? - Did she get it? They are signing the documents. Would you please sign? Just one last formality. The appropriate registration must be made at the courts. If you want to come with me .... it will take a minute. Let's go. - Are not you coming, Mr. Bruno? - I have so much to do here ..... I'm glad you were able to ... I apologize if I made you suffer. What are you doing here? Let's go. Don't be silly, let's go. Look, I'm leaving. I'm leaving, got that? Then I'm leaving! Now that she is rich, she won't even greet me. - Please, don't say that. - She won't look at me in the face. I loved her as my own daughter. Dad, why do you say that if you knows it's not true? - People are turning... - Sure they turn, and they must know. Since Giulia is rich, she is ashamed of me. You are drunk, you've had four large glasses. I wanted to forget, and I still need two more to forget everything. What are you doing? Come on, dad, off to bed. Watch it, I'm sober ... carfeul. Giulia, why that face? Didn't they give you the cash? Yes, here it is. You better give it to me, because you're so good that you may give everything to all those losers. And it's also dangerous. Look, there's nothing to worry with me. The money, the money! Grab him, he has $ 6,000 in the mouth! Get the dog! Don't shoot, you may hit someone! Mr. Lawy..... - He ate them all! - What a disaster. What are we going to do, what are we going to live from? What are we going to do? Do you think I'm going to marry you now? Because of your pretty face? You're not even my type! Get away from me, you wretch! Very well done! Hey, you! This jacket doesn't suit you here. I'm a collector, you know? - Let's go. - Where to? Wherever you want, this is a free country. I leave it up to you. Either to the police station, or .... or we'll look for a nice little ship, huh? We'll look for a little ship. Let's go. Of course, $ 6,000 .... that poor girl must be devastated. I haven't seen such an ugly and disgusting dog in my entire life . Mr. Lawyer, you have eaten $ 6,000, and you did it out of malice, out of envy. You haven't changed, but maybe for once in your life, although unwittingly, you've also done something good. Maybe you saved that girl's life. On behalf of Miss Giulia, I thank you. I brought you .... a steak. Hey, Tonino, last night the dog catchers took away your dog. I don't care, he ate Giulia's money. Okay, a dog could not know that was money. He knows everything. So, are you not sorry that he was taken away? No. Do you know what they do with them when nobody picks them up? - They will have him locked up. - But only for 48 hours. If nobody rescues him, they will put him down. Think about that a little and do me a favor, Tonino, I'll give you four dollars to pay the fine. Go to pick him up in the kennel and put on him this muzzle and this collar. Otherwise, they will lock him up again. - Will you go? - Yes. Listen, Tonino .... Don't tell the dog that I gave you the money. I don't want to play with you, you've eaten Giulia's money. We're finished! We're no longer friends, got that? Go away, go away. Go, find yourself another friend. Someone else set you free, not me. I shouldn't have told you, but it was Mr. Bruno the one who gave me the money. OK, go away. - Why don't you sleep? - Because I can't. - Are you not feeling well? - I have quarreled with my dog. He ate your money, I want nothing with him anymore. - Are you sorry? - And also .... Sssssh... How will he eat now with the muzzle? Tomorrow morning you look for him and make peace. No. Look, Tonino, the dog has stolen my money, that's a fact. But it's better that way ... so that I won't be a wretch all my life. Thanks to the dog I realized in time that Alfonso is bad. The dog ate the money, but now I know that there is a person who really loves me. - Who, me? - Yes, you. Tomorrow you look for the dog and make peace. - Are you not angry at him? - No, just the opposite. Also, when you see him tomorrow, you tell him: - "Thanks from Giulia." - Yes. And now go to sleep. - I can't. - Why not? Because I'm happy. You cowards, all against one! Go on, go and call the dog now. Go on, call him. Go on, go and call the dog now. Stop it, man. Leave that dog alone! Leave that dog alone! You saved me, I love you very much. - Tonino! Tonino! Come here right now! - Mom, mom, the dog! See how he wasn't bad? He defended me! They all beat me, they wanted to kill me! Come mom, come! But where is that dog? Mr. Pietrino, you and your daughter-in-law are like her parents and... I do not know whom to address, and then I thought... I don't know, well, that you... Mr. Pietrino, I have the honour of asking for Miss Giulia's hand. Bruno! I know, I know perfectly well that it's not reciprocal, - to her I'm just a good friend. - Watch it, it's freshly painted. She is alone ... she needs help ... someone who watches over her. - But do you love her? - From the day she arrived. - And have you told her? - No. - Well I did! - And what did he say? The lawyer, the lawyer is back! Good morning, Mr. Lawyer. I know you're absolutely right, but please understand .... - I beg you to forgive me. - For what? When we came back from meeting with the judge and you were... you didn't want to let me open the safe and I... Well, you know. What nonsense are you talking about? I've been away on a trip. OK? - If you are back, it means that... - Simply ... that I've just returned from a business trip! Yes sir. - A business trip. - That's it. - Today's files. - No, no, I have no time right now. Good morning, you may come back whenever you wish, - dogs are not allowed. - Thanks, I had already noticed. Dog! Dog! Do you want chocolate? No, I don't. Mr. Lawyer.... I want you inform you that the files, while you were traveling, I mean ... Cut the preamble, shall we go to the facts? I gave Gennaro Farace a three months' extension. How kind of you. I have postponed the eviction on the third floor until the end of next month. I've paid the plumber's bill because it wasn't the tenant's responsibility. I have canceled the tailor's interest because they were usury! Why do you scream so much? I'm not deaf. And now let me tell you something that has to do with me, From next month on, don't count on my services. I'll leave on the 1st of the month, Mr. Lawyer. You are leaving on the 1st of the month .... well .... - Anything else? - No, nothing. - Nothing, right? - Nothing. I have heard that ... that you want to get married. Yes sir. - But that is a private matter. - Something private ... yes, of course. Tell me, what happened to that girl's inheritance? I've paid it off. I opened the safe by following the pertinent formalities and I paid it off. Well, congratulations. You have a rich girlfriend, huh? - That girl doesn't have a penny! - Oh no? How is that possible? Because a dog... A filthy dog, a disgusting animal ate the $ 6,000. A dog .... I'm going to open the safe. Look .... I would like to know ... Whose banknotes were the ones swallowed by that dog? - Ours or the girl's? - They were hers. Don't worry, when she was paid she signed a receipt. - Then, the receipt must be here. - Yes. - Where? - There, in the receipts folder. No, it's not here. That's not possible... That's not possible, That's not possible, Mr. Lawyer, I personally put it in the folder, which I later placed in the safe! Oh, I'm going crazy, it was here...! Maybe you've put it it in your pocket? What are you suggesting? You can search me. I don't understand... Disappearing like this, no... It doesn't matter, Miss Giulia will not deny that she received the money ... and... besides, many witnesses saw it, the judge himself, the policemen, all the neighbours saw ... They have all seen the dog that...! Where did you learn Law? Come on, man. Don't you remember the "scripta manent", Latin ...? A payment without a signed receipt has no value whatsoever, but I will not be the one paying for this mistake, you will be paying for every penny! Me? Me paying for it? With the pittance you pay me? So it is not enough? Then I'll raise your salary so that you can pay and until you don't repay the $ 6,000 you will not leave this office! Mr. Lawyer, now I understand... I, I must tell you... No, no, it's lunch time. - Come on, use your time. - I must tell you, Mr. Lawyer ... Mr. Lawyer! Good Morning. Ah, Giuseppa, the lawyer greeted me first. - Giulia ... - What happened? Good news for you, the lawyer said he will repay you the $ 6,000 and this means that... you no longer need to marry me. Now you are free, Giulia. I just wanted ... to tell you this. Bruno ... Bruno .... but I love you. Hey, boy. Let's go. - So, you are the dog? - Yes. Then, I love you. And you? Do you want chocolate? Here. A tale, do you want a tale? A tale of fairies, of princes, of witches .... OK, OK, I'll buy them all. English subtitles by O Cangaceiro
