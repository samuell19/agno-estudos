Have a nice day. I think they're going to fire you if you keep arriving so late. If they fire me it wouldn't be because of that. - Right, that's the least worst thing that you do. I swear to God, girl. People think that public transport is a can of sardines! And there was this pregnant woman, Let me tell you, I need someone to give me lifts, like right now, like... Wouldn't it be better if you just finished college? And maybe like, get a job that pays you well so you buy yourself a car? Wouldn't it be better if you graduated? And you get yourself that job? I can't stand you. Look just get onto this, let's get to work. I just don't get it Manuel. I don't get it! This is the fourth time this elevator is broken and it's supposedly new! Well sir, remember that this building is still under construction. Even so, all the elevators in the world need checkups. And as far as I know this building should be close as it is under construction! Listen up kid, this building is 100% complete. The only part that is still missing is the tower, and that is none of your concern. Your concern should be to get this elevator working properly! Because if it doesn't, the building will sue you! Well sir do as you like, I'm just the guy they hired to check the elevator. Let's get out of here. What's up boss? Did they fix it? Yeah, so it seems. Excuse me, could you tell me where is the tool shop? I came to buy some glue but I don't know where. Sure, do you see that elevator there? You go to the fourth floor and you'll see it right there. Thanks a lot, bye. Aren't you Lola? - Yes, how did you know? I've got all my info right here! Let me show you. Look. Oh, it's the magazine! Can I borrow it? Sure. It's out already, that's awesome. But I told the photographer to make me look less fatty... That's a pretty picture. Don't you have a position on your company for like... a personal assistant? And maybe like a monthly salary of 60,000? 60,000? Don't you want a danish chicken breast sandwich with that too? And wholemeal bread, honey. Say what? And wholemeal bread, honey. Say what? Greetings, is there any problem with the client? - Not at all. No, not at all! I was just asking for some info and these guys did an amazing job. You should give a raise to this sir right here, he is splendid. See? Just helping out. Bye! Thanks for the magazine. Okay what is going on here? Nothing boss, really. You're going over the line with the clients, be really careful now. And I got you on my sights, you hear me? I told you that you were getting fired. Look who's coming now. The worst bitch of them all! I love her show so much... I'm sure that girl is swimming in cash. She must be swatting guys like flies, what a bitch. What are you up to girls, still looking for boyfriends? Of course girl! I want mine 90, 90 and 2. How so? 90 years, 90 millions in the bank and 2 years to live. I would get married and would become the real millionaire I am. I love it, mind if I borrow it for the show? Can we help you? Yeah, is the spa on the 10th floor working already? No, there is nothing done beyond the 9th floor. But they will set up a lounge on the basement 4th. A lounge, on the basement? That sounds pretty hot, huh? Yeah so, so hot... What a sexy basement! You're too much, I swear. Bye. Bye bye! Now what do I do? Hello? Mario, I'm so sorry for calling but... I'm trapped on an elevator and I'm really scared. And what the fuck do you want me to do Clara? Call security or the firemen! You call me for the most stupid things, I swear. Just look at that, she doesn't seem to well. What's wrong with her? I think I've seen her before. That's right, look at this! That girl just married that super rich guy. Let's ask her if the guy ask her for a divorce. - Please... Are you okay ma'am? - Do you work here? Well I'm part of the firemen brigade and I help on the mall, what's wrong? Look, I just got the scare of my life on that elevator, It got stucked and I was trapped inside. I could have died in there! Calm down we just got that fixed, don't worry. That's impossible, this just happened two minutes ago! And we got it fixed over a minute ago, so don't worry. My name is Raul, it's a pleasure. I'm Clara. And don't worry, if something ever happens again, this is my phone number, you just call. Thanks a lot. Look, are you sure it's fixed? Don't worry and trust me you can get in there as many times af you want and nothing will happen. It's all fixed now, okay? Oh, okay then. Thanks a lot. - Have a nice day, bye. Thanks! Yes ma'am, I understand. It won't happen again. Have a nice day. Look who's coming now! Well see who's got a little lover now. Miss Amanda Del Valle... My god she is flaming hot. Even I would marry a woman like that and become a serious, serious man. Yep, you should. Good day, Miss Amanda. Miss Amanda, looking as fancy as ever. Thank you pretty, you too. I mean, your uniform always looking on point. When I grow up miss, I want to be just like you. We're not so distant on age, let me tell you. I didn't meant by age, more like in style... Style... your glamour just broke the glamour-o-meter. Respect the clients boy! I was just trying to be nice! Hey... isn't there like a computer store here? Ah yes, you see that hallway? You go through there, you'll see the elevator then go to basement 1 and you'll see it. Okay, thanks a lot. And how's the sugar daddy of a husband you have? What did you say? He didn't said anything, have a nice day. You crossed the line, for real this time. You're out of your mind today. Miss Amanda Fernandez Del Valle... The most glamorous woman on this country. The wife of the worst rich son of a bitch of them all. That guy is super hot. I'm talking to you, don't you have any bounds? You can't live up like this. Get a grip, I'm telling you. You need to chill out, sweetie. Go out for once, let your hair loose, treat yourself. You could get into some serious trouble if you don't fix that! We're sorry ma'am, use the other elevator. This one is under maintenance. Sir... The elevator is broken again, calling the office for some tools. This elevator will kill me, I swear. Okay, okay. Did you put a sign so people don't use it? Yes sir. Why don't you take him to the park and I catch up with you in an hour? Bye honey. Bye. Didn't I just take this off? I must be loosing my mind. Tell me. Don't tell me the elevator is broken again. - You didn't took off the sign. You want me to check every floor to make sure you did? No, not at all. I think I must have missed that one. - All good, I'll take it. Hi. - Hi. Going down? - No, up. You're going to the basement too? - Yeah, going to the computer store. Oh, I'm going there too. Wait a minute are you going up or down? I thought we were going up, now we're going down. Did you push the button already? I'm going to the third floor. I don't think this is working. - Oh no, this can't be... I just got stucked in here and they told me they fixed it. Well... Uh Oh. This isn't working. What just happened? - I don't know! What's going on? What's happening to her? She's dying, she's dying! We need some water! - What's going on? Ma'am please! Yes sir? It seems that the elevator still has some problems. What do you mean? I just took off the signs. It was you who ordered them back? - Of course it was me! What do you mean you took them off? - Well, I only took the one on the first floor. Eladio? Did you put the out of order signs back on? - Yes sir, but somebody took them off. I'm putting them again. - What a fucking mess. The fourth elevator is broken again sir and I think there's people inside. Where is that piece of crap stucked at now? - At the third basement floor but look... I think it fell down. - What? How can you say that so calmed? "I think it fell, I think it fell..." We have to move now! Call the people who fixed the elevator, let's go. - We're on it. Ma'am. What's that? - Contact cement. Wait what? Explain to me what is that. Heavy duty cement. You'll excuse me but, this is the first time I hear that somebody uses cement to help somebody. It has a really strong smell, it's industrial. - You listen to her, she knows. You take that thing off my face. This will make you feel better... Are you feeling okay now? Ma'am... Calm down, this will help you to come back to your senses. I can't believe this is happening. Shut up already! Just let the girl do her work. Wait a second honey, "the girl" has a name. - Yeah but I don't know it. Just keep doing that, it seems that is working. Alright, back off. Stand up. Come over here. Stay here. You okay? Just lay off for a bit and breathe. Let me have another sniff. She really liked to snort it out huh? - I'll give you some more but be careful, alright? Smell it. Okay, okay. That's it. Hey! I don't know where I am... Calm down, calm down. How do you want her to calm down if you're drugging her? That wasn't a drug! Well, something like that. Just lay down for a bit and you'll feel better. You're just feeling a little tipsy. I was poisoned! - No you were not! I'm going to die! - No! Calm down! Help, help! Calm down, calm down... Calm down! - Help me please... Everything is alright! - Mario, I'm going to die... My god... - I'm going to die. If you don't settle down, you'll feel worse. Calm down, calm down. Water please. Here, drink some water. Drink it, drink water. Just breathe, take some water and relax. That cement is pure quality huh? - Calm down. Just breathe and lay down. My god... - Calm down. Feeling any better? Yes. This bitch is crazy. Now what? Now where's that damn elevator? - Well boss, that door is connected to a warehouse... After that, there is a basement, that's where the elevator should be. They must be trapped there. I get it, but where is the key of this padlock? But boss this door is forbidden! You know what? I don't have the faintest idea of who might have that key. Then we most break it! Where are the firemen? - On their way sir. Just look at that... Excuse me sir, they're telling me that the elevator is at the 9th floor. Thank god they're at the 9th floor, let's go! What was that? I will have a heart attack, I swear to god... It's so hot in here... Will somebody help us or what? My feet hurt. This is what I get for coming to low quality places. This would happen even in the Buckingham palace, so relax sister, this is a top notch place. Listen to me, miss... You don't talk to me like that, because we're not alike, you hear? That's right, we're not alike, excuse me... we all go to the bathroom or what do you do huh? Just shut up already! - Please! You won't get anywhere acting like that! I think I'll get me some white meat today. Just one thing. Does any of you have signal on your phones? I don't have any. My phone is in my hand bag, could you please hand it to me? Thanks. No signal here. Me neither. Not even a single line. My name's Sabrina. You? Clara. Olivia. Amanda. The name's Lola. My friends call me Lola. That means no body calls me Lola. I don't have any friends. Why would that be? Don't cross the line now or we're gonna have a problem. Problem? Let's have it then. - What are you trying to do girl? Stop... I need my Mario... Please call Mario. Clara, no one has any signal, please explain to her. Please call Mario... Call Mario! - We don't have signal for fuck's sake! Who the fuck is Mario? Your husband? My ex. So bitter being divorced... You shouldn't have said that. I was just joking. Even so, you women love to suffer for men. You women? And what are you supposed to be, a zebra? No, I'm a panther. Any problem? Excuse me, Panther. Don't get that on me now. No, she's right. Men are scumbags. They drink the juice from us. And then, when they find a new fruit, they throw us out. I had a terrible day today. So whatever you have to say, save it for tomorrow. Did mom came by for dinner? Yes, she came. Everybody came. Except you. That's a shame, Mario. Well... We'll talk tomorrow. - Fuck no, we're talking now. Do you really think I'm some kind of garbage? And you can make me feel like shit whenever you want? Clara, I told you we'll talk tomorrow alright? I'm not in the mood. And if you keep screwing up like that, we'll have a problem. A big one. Is that so? So let's do it, then! Let's. I'm tired of you cheating on me with that teen! You don't even try to hide it. You don't have any shame knowing that we're married? What? Did she said she would give you kids? Is that it? That I just can't give you a child? At least tell me you big son of a bitch, you piece of shit! Mind the language now... and stop shouting. - I'll shout all I want! And you think... that I'll buy the story that this is the first time? No baby. I stood it with the lawyer with the big tits, with the Polish that smelled like shit and even Lucy, who acted like she was a saint! And God knows how many more! Just take your pills, you seem stressed out. Don't tell me to take any god damn pills, I'm not crazy! And you know what? Take all your stuff and get the fuck out, because I'm not a piece of shit! I know you're with that teenager. Tell me! First of all... If somebody needs to pick up all of her shit and get the fuck out of this house, it's you. Because I bought this house with my money, this is my house. So you can start taking your stuff and leaving to some shit hole if you like. And don't bother or wake me up tomorrow, because I have the day off. Alright? And, how old was that teenage girl? She was 20. How old is he? 40? 45 he has, that fucking pig. And... What happened? I left. You hear me out now, if you leave you won't come back. And get this straight, if you leave that door another one will come... I'm not a man who lives alone and you know it. What else do you want from me huh? That I just keep standing your cheating? You arrive late at night, smelling like sex! There's a moment where a woman, no matter how deep in love she is... she grows tired of being the honest and boring wife, waiting just for you to come back every night. Or do you think it's easy for me to look at you dancing, drinking and enjoying yourself? Hold on a second! Are you telling me you were following me? - Yes! I follow you up every time you leave, any problem? I've seen you drinking, dancing and touching other women. There's nothing more humiliating... than when you find by accident, your husband... and his lover... In front of your friends. Isn't that Mario? Wait here. Hello Mario. What are you doing here Clara? And who's this girl? - Just a coworker. A what? Clara... Just go home. Don't make a little scene here alright? You know I'm not a woman who makes scenes. And listen to me, girl. Just so you know... you'll be sleeping with an asshole who won't even call back. So don't get to excited now. Clara, look... You have 5 seconds to leave now. Or what? Or what? Huh? Tell me! What? Are you going to hit me in front of all these people? Because now that, would be an scene. And you, my love... and this mister sitting here, doesn't like scenes does he? But it's okay, no problem. I'll leave. No body can understand the shame and anger... And you know what? I also cheated on you, do you think you're special? And don't laugh! May I know with who? With Walter! Walter? Hear me now, you're a filthy and dirty whore! You do me a favor and pick all of your stuff and get the fuck out of here now. I'm on it. And who is Walter? Walter is... Walter is a... Really sweet guy. Ah, same old story. He's not good looking... but he's sweet and he treats me well. Now love, I have a theory with that, I'd rather... A not so good looking guy but really calmed, instead of a pretty boy addicted to low quality meat. The worst thing of all is how people can be so filthy and perverted... So you like this place? Yeah I do. - It's a nice place. Are you happy? - Yes. I like seeing you happy. - Aw, Thanks. Yeah I truly do. Thank you. Let's make a toast, for a perfect night. - Yes. Alright? Cheers. - Cheers. I'm going to the bathroom, I'll be right back. Excuse me but I just couldn't stop myself from telling you that you're really pretty... to be with that thing. Allow me to give you my number. Call me. Girl... You can do so much better than that. Look at the guy on the counter. He's crazy for you. You just give him a wink, alright? Clara baby, what's wrong? Nothing at all! Sure? - Yeah, pretty sure. Let's go. - Yes let's go now. People can be so rude! You said it sister. People love to stick their noses in other people's business until it smells bad. That's true. A lot of friends told me to go out and meet more men, that Walter wasn't the only one... That it wouldn't work out... But god damn, it seems that he is the only one sometimes. Lot's of jerks out there. Look love, things aren't that complicated, just learn to enjoy the moment... and make them unforgettable. Why do you say that? Because the fact that we just met, doesn't mean that we can't have a passionate night. So you just met me like an hour ago and you want to take me to your bed already? And then tomorrow you won't take my calls or even call me yourself. Listen, you're a very special woman, you just have something, like a wonderful angel... You are wedding material. Wedding material? You just met me and you want to marry me? Listen to me baby, life is short, you don't know when will you die. So why don't we go to my apartment and sort this out? In bed. Are you serious? I just felt like I was some kind of... Taxi. Like everybody wanted to get inside of me. Don't you worry my dear, that man is going to pay it really bad. That girl that is with him will steal even his liver. He'll leave him mad as a cow. I'll have to call my grandma, I want to learn how to sew. Thursday and I'm reading a magazine... Unbelievable. Which one should I use? Don't bother me with dresses. I'm a man who works way too much, I'm tired. I won't go out, not a chance. Of course you're tired, but if you think that I will stay at home on Thursday, you're wrong. I'll go out with my friends and who knows what will happen? So get used to it, pretty boy. But hey, don't you even think about giving him another chance alright? Because he'll do it again with another one. I found them once on a club. She was dancing like a crazy bitch, what a sight to behold! Suddenly Mario arrived and made her yet another scene. I felt embarrassed somehow. Cut it out, cut it out! I told you this would happen. Are you mad? If you felt sorry for him, I know how this will end. They lived happy forever and after, went to their honey moon... And then he comes back and cheats on you again. Worse. - Worse? What did you do? I became his lover. What? I started going out with him behind the girl's back. I can't believe it. Do you have any doubts pretty? We women are so blind sometimes. But you are in another level. Even worse, she made us a scene. To us! Af if she was the man's wife and I was the side chick. Oh girl, please. I can't take this anymore! I'm sick of this shit! I want to get out of here! Calm down baby. Is this an elevator or a roller coaster? It's like a marriage. Do you know about marriage? I bet you've never been married. You know what? I was married once, in case you didn't know. And they did to me the exact same thing that they did to her. The only difference is that I wasn't cheated with a 20 year old girl. Do you really want to know? I was wearing sexy underwear like an idiot, I even had candles, incense and melted chocolate... And that asshole, every time he arrived he would tell me that he wasn't in the mood. What is all this crap? Just a little naughty surprise I prepared for you, baby. Some melted chocolate I want to rub all over your delicious body... Shit Olivia, that's all you think about? I'm tired... I have hundreds of problems at work and you want me to get here and act like a porn star? That's the good life, ain't it? I started feeling pretty bad... I thought I was the one to blame. Same as Clara, my friends told me that he had a lover. I went crazy. I started following him, to look for clues, check all of his stuff. I looked for that women, even underneath the earth. And I didn't found her. Until one day... I lost a flight... A flight I was taking to Miami. I headed back home thinking I would give him a little surprise... But I didn't expected that the surprise was for me. So what did you do? I sat on the living room, all night. In complete silence. Waiting that he would wake up and make some coffee for his lover. Just in case you didn't knew, faggot... There's something called "hotel". Where the foxes take their lovers. Are you serious? In my own bed? Olivia... - No, listen to me you fucking faggot! In my own bed, with another man! And you know what? Get out of here and take your faggot with you! Is everything okay my love? I left. I couldn't go back ever since. My sister had to go and take everything. Somebody in there? Yes! - Okay! Please stand back, we'll open the door. What did he say? Lend me a wrench. We're going to force it open, careful! Holy shit, it fell down! Let's get moving! What the fuck is going on asshole? Somebody out there? - Open up! There's no one there. Whatever did we do to deserve this?! I can't take this anymore... I want to go home, my head hurts. Move aside please! - You don't have to push me! This is my corner since I got here. Did you buy the elevator you prick? You wanna fight now? - Stop it already! I'm sorry, I just want to get out of here... I don't even want to talk to anyone. I just want to get out, nothing personal. - We all want to get out of here. Listen, the one who should be apologizing... it's me. I didn't even imagine that about your marriage. I'm really sorry. Don't worry about it. So what did you do? What any woman would do in that case. Alcohol... and men. Until one day... Looking for something that wasn't really missing... A woman came by. What? Excuse me. Sorry. - It's okay. Darling! - My love, how are you? Good, how about you? Is she looking? - Yes. You look pretty lonely and bored... Don't you wanna have a good time? Take it easy. Listen to me... You got tons of alternatives... in life. And they are very pleasant... And no one knows a woman better than another woman. So why don't you get me some drinks? And we can talk about your woes. What do you say? That girl got seduce on me. She made me feel so much things... I was so nervous. She was looking so calmed... she took my hand and she took me to the bathroom. What the actual fuck? Don't worry baby, take it easy. How are we doing? Good, I believe... Holy shit, even I'm getting horny. We're getting all wet around here. As that piece of shit was a faggot at the end, I discovered alternatives too. Just hear this woman out. Are you in there? No you son of a bitch, we're out for dinner! Okay. We'll turn off everything so the elevator stops moving, don't worry that we're here. I'm sick of being in here. Do you know where are the electric breakers? - I do sir. Okay, get going and turn it off! But sir we have to fill in the papers first. Papers? What papers? Get going and turn that shit off! Sabrina, give me some water. Well I am happily married. With the perfect man. Alejandro Del Valle. Good looking, has money... and... Best of all, he loves our son above all things. And I supposed he loves you too as well right? I don't care about that. All I care about is that he gives me everything a woman could need. He spoils our son, he gets him whatever he wants. I can't complain. Material things are not everything in life. Well for me it is, very important. You know what it's like to grow in the slums? Our house had ground for flooring, and the bathroom was a latrine. I do know what it's like and I won't go back to it. Not for anyone or anything in the world. I left that lifestyle forever. So the little princess isn't blue blooded huh? I mean... No offense, I worked as a truck manager for my dad and that ain't no ladies work. And if I wasn't as wild as I am, I would had a very bad time. What's up man? Remember we have to talk. Move it. Yes? Where did you take the merchandise again? You told me to deliver it to the building at the 4th street and that's what I did so, take a hike my dear. Take a hike? You're the one who's gonna take a hike. Who's that, my boy? That's you, and that's not the 4th street. So you were following me, huh? - It's my money, of course I have to follow you, thief! I'll be out by tomorrow and I will fucking kill you, bitch! Are you threatening me? I'm going to kill you! - You're threatening me? Hold on, are you threatening me? Hold on! Wait up, don't take him yet! - Fucking bitch! Come here you motherfucker! Say that to my face, bring it on! Everyone back to work. Thank you. He's safe because they took him away, if not, he would get what he's yours. And whoever wants to fuck with me, he's gonna get it too! Don't you get on my nerves, those god damned truckers... it's a matter of survival, it's me or them. They're men. Damn, that was pretty intense. I wish I was like that. - No fun at all. And what would you do to Mario if you were me? Your Mario? I would take a razor and cut him up in pieces, then serve him up with lemon and salt. That's wild! You're so cool. I wish I could be like that. - I'll show you how. We all evolve because of our needs. Life can really surprise you. Why do you say that? Just talking to myself... Well you don't have to open up if you don't like, but Amanda... Maybe getting it out of your chest would help. It's like freeing yourself. Ladies, why do you complicate so much? You're all pretty women. You should be enjoying your life and that's it. You never know when will you die or what and that's... Out of service, unavailable, goodbye whatsapp. No more talking. Don't take it the wrong way... You're so... unpleasant sometimes. Why is that? Because I don't have to prove anything like you? If I was like that, I wouldn't stand for myself, like you. I'm sure you even take beatings from that prick. You don't talk shit about my family! - No, no! Calm down... Calm down! You dropped something. Are you going to keep this up? God damn. What's even worse... is that this bitch is right. My "perfect" life. My perfect family, my perfect husband... That's a lot of shit. But I have to stand that shit, because of my son. He couldn't stand the things I had to at his age. Hey baby. Leave me alone. What do you mean, we're not doing anything! - Leave me alone! Say hi to your mom for me. She got away this time. Don't worry baby, we'll leave this place someday. Let's just don't talk about that. If you would just listen to me and get married with Mr. Paquito. Don't you mention that old pervert, I'd rather eat dirt than marrying him. He's not that old, he's a good man with money. - I told you to not talk to me about him! If father could hear you... - Don't you talk about that rat here. I'll see you someday, pregnant by one of those thugs. If father could hear you, he would slap you. Baby! Don't run so much! - You'll fall down! Wait for me, baby! Amandita! Amandita! No! - Don't worry my love! When will you stop running? Let's get her! - Let's go! Amandita! - Fucking stop now! Stop! Stay there! Please... Take your clothes off. Please don't do this, no... Take it off! No... Fucking do it! Shit man what is that? Dude that's a woman. A woman? - Let's call the police, she's dead! Let's go! - What? Damn! Damn sister, I... I don't know what to say... I... If you had spoken... If you had said anything when we were talking... anything about that... I would have never, ever... said that. I mean... I'm so sorry... It's okay, it's nothing. Truly, I feel so sorry for saying that. It's okay. Don't worry, it's just that... from that horrible moment, my beloved child was born. Hello baby, mommy's cute little baby. Why are you so full of mosquito bites? I'll have to light a carton of eggs, so mosquitoes go away. Good day. Hello. Aren't you the girl that helped me a year ago to leave this place? Oh yeah, what a coincidence. Is this your baby? Yeah. He is so pretty, daddy must be happy. No... He's not happy? It's not that... The thing is that... He doesn't have a dad. He doesn't have a dad? Okay. That day I met Alejandro. So that means... that son is not your husband's? I feel even worse now. Don't you worry, it's okay. When he brought me to the capital... it was like a whole new world. And when he first took me to a restaurant... Everything was so pretty, I didn't even wanted to eat. Look at him. My favorite dish, just smell it Amanda. Thanks. What's wrong, don't you like it? No, it's not that... I just feel a little embarrassed. I... I don't know how rich people eat. Even so, I've never been in a place so... so fancy as this. We only used spoons back at my place. But that's just spaghetti. They just put some leaves on it... two tomatoes, all pretty... and it's called pasta. But it's just spaghetti. You have eaten spaghetti before, right? You want to see how rich people eat spaghetti? We're going to eat this, with our hands. With our hands? - Our bare hands. Go for it, eat. It's pretty good! - I know. I have something in my tooth? And if you like bread, look. Can I make a little sandwich? - Of course, but don't forget the fancy tomatoes. You're crazy. He asked for my hand at her mother's house. The worst person I've ever met. No way I'm letting you marry that woman, she's a peasant! Are you out of your mind? What has she done to you? She's white, so what? And who's that boy? Only God knows who she had him with. - I'm going to tell you one thing, mother. I said it already... Amanda is the woman I love. And just so you know, I'm marrying her tomorrow! And that little boy you say you don't know who he's from... He'll be your grandson, tomorrow! And he'll be my successor! - You're going crazy. I'll never accept that peasant in my house! Get out of here and never come back, you, that peasant and the kid! Then the problems started to come out. He started to bring up... everything he would pay for me. Because men, the money they spend on you... That's how they claim they own you. And believe they can control you. While they can still go out and do whatever they want. They travel, go out with friends... and their sexual boredom. And they find any slut. Listen to me you little slut, Don't call my husband again. No body messes with my family's future... my son's future. Or I'll get you killed, you hear? Hello? I thought we agreed you wouldn't call her anymore. I'll call her whenever I want. I don't have to take this from her. She's the one who has to take it from me. Amanda, listen... I'm going to explain something to you, the best way I can. Very simple. So you understand, no matter your limitations. There will always be another girl, always. Why? Why not? Because I can. You see this? The house, the cars, the money... No body took me out of the slums and gave it to me. It's my life's work, I've worked like an animal. That's why I not only deserve another girl, I deserve the world. Baby, be happy. Go and... I don't know... Get some furniture upholstered. Make a painting, I don't know... just be happy. And mind your own business. If this makes you upset... Well... Take your kid... take your clothes... Not the ones I gave you though. The clothes you had when I brought you here. Those three hippie dresses. And you go back to the hole I took you from. You're a man so full of bullshit. That's what you are. Bullshit is what was around you, on the fields. Did you forgot? Are you legally married? That's something called, having them grabbed by the balls. Get a divorce and take from him half of what he's got. Damn, the shy girl just became the devil's lawyer. I think I told him that once and... He didn't liked that at all. Look baby... I... I want a divorce. I just don't like being cheated on. If we keep this up... I'll end up cheating too... And that isn't life. You think I'm dumb huh? You're cheating on me aren't you, you slut? No... Of course not! And it's not like I haven't felt like it Or I don't have contenders... but... You married a stupid one. And you're so glad, aren't you? Because if that's what you want... Alright. No problem. I'll call those two guys who raped me... So they'll fuck me again. But this time, I'll have a great time! Fuck! Take this you bitch, you want to have a good time? You're going to respect me, you bitch! I had to go to plastic surgery for over a year. I had to wear a lot of makeup, so people wouldn't notice the scars. Why don't you leave that piece of crap? I know why. Tell me one good reason why a woman should stand that level of abuse, Clara. What? Is it money? It's his child. Because when we women, get obsessed with a man... We think we can make him change, until the very end. Generally it's because... all that you said before. It seems none of us have a normal life. Looks like Sabrina is the only one. Don't look at me, I won't talk about my private life. I don't have any problems like that, I'm fine. This elevator is getting tense. Come on pretty, spill the beans! We know... Oh yeah, what do you know? Tell me, come on. Relax girl, I was just saying, take it easy. That's tense. And what about you, Lola? What's your problem? You're another woman who devour men like a lion? You almost nailed it until you said lion. I think you meant lioness, because I really like men and I'm not into that. Are you mad about it, Lion? - Now you're looking for a fight, huh? Have you seen my height? You saw my will? - Stop it, both of you. Let's just wait until they take us out of here. Do you have a boyfriend? Don't ask about that shit. I don't wanna talk about it. So what's your problem, Lola? If you have one, just say it and if you don't, then say it. I don't have a boyfriend, Amanda. Men run away from me, even my dad, why would that be? You didn't have a good relation with your dad? He died. I'm sorry. - It's okay, it was long ago. People say women find attractive men who are like their dads. Yeah, but the problem is when you don't know anything about your dad. Yes sir, yes sir. I'm sorry miss, it seems that the reunion will be held up a little bit longer. Did you tell him that it was me? - Of course. What did he said? - He said that you must wait. That I must wait? It's been over an hour! Sorry baby, I can't see you today. I'm pretty busy. That's okay dad, when you have time give me a call and you tell that girl that I'm your daughter, and I can call you as much as I want, because I don't bother you for money, for pizza or for you to take me out, that's not for what I call. Can you lower your tone? I have clients in there. It's just that... that girl makes my blood boil. By the way, what was your boyfriend's name again? - Really? Daddy, we broke up a year ago. Are you seriously going to keep asking? I didn't know. - How would you? You haven't even called in 6 months! You could have a grandson for all you know! Grandson? Are you pregnant? Daddy... It was a joke. That truck you almost lost in Haiti... I sorted it out, somebody is taking it back for us. And about that girl who was going to sue your driver, because he's crazy, I sorted that out too with a police friend, you know how? Because friends are gained with favors and time, something you don't spend with me. Take care, daddy. Bye. You see how she acts? - Well sir, I'm sorry but she's right. We all need to have our dad around us. Make me a memo, I'll take her out for pizza if I have the time. The only thing I can't complain about... is that at least, he leaved me the company. The trucks, the company, everything. That woman got nothing at all. He even cheated on her. You handle all that by yourself? If you need to know yes, baby. I work my ass off. Like a man. Maybe that's why all men run from me. Except Pablo... - Who is Pablo? The only one who can stand me, Pablito. Until he sees me arguing in the office, he runs away when I'm like that. One day... He found the perfect moment to ask me out but he didn't know how. That was so funny. You wanna tell me something? Yeah! Hear me out, I know I'm not super good looking or anything like that and well, I don't know how to treat women... I've been feeling something for you, for about three months. But sometimes you know... My mom told me something the other day. From Winnie The Pooh. Women were made to be loved... not to understand them. But if you understand that woman, even if you don't love her... that's love... and if it ain't, then you at least like her. But the thing is, you understand her. So you love her. Do you understand? What a robbery. - A robbery? Wait a second. You're seeing that? That's a robbery. So you'll excuse me, baby. Hey, who do you think you're fucking with? You're sure are fucking crazy, even I would run from you. A shotgun for what, are you mad? - This girl is my idol. A shotgun to shoot up two guys? Bullshit. God damn this bitch is a kill joy. Look how these ladies look so beautiful when they laugh, just believe it and laugh! Be serious, what did you do with the shotgun? What did I do? Aren't you hearing this kill joy? I couldn't kill anyone, I just use it to gain some respect. I think I'm starting to like you, you should lend me that shotgun, I'll give my husband a little surprise. - What? Without any shells? Wasn't everything under control? Move, move! Cut the god damned electricity now! It opened! - Where the fuck are we? We can go out! - I want to get out! My god! Open up! I'm sick of this. - I can't take this anymore. I'm sick. Oh god! It's open, let's get out! Get out, come on! Move, let's get out! Oh god, if it closes again? - Just move and shut up! Clara get out I can't! - Of course you can! Do it! - Oh fuck! Come on! Get over here! Fuck, don't forget the shoes! Our shoes, damn it! Take all your stuff, we're out of here. Oh my god, thank you so much! I can't believe we're out. This thing has no buttons! How are we going to get out? - Thank you... Whose is this? - Mine, thank you. I don't think there's an exit here, people. - Look, we have a light. Let's see if this thing turns on. The light works! There's no exit here. Wait up women! There's no way to exit over here. Look for some kind of exit, a hole... I don't know. There's not even a single door in here! Look first! There's not even a hole to crawl out! Hole? You bunch of idiots, where are we supposed to go now? Back to the elevator! - Back to fucking where? Let's go back, it will leave without us! - That's true, there's nothing here. But we're better here, we got light! - Listen up people! I have to go back with my son! - Don't go into the elevator again, for God's sake! Don't do it! Get out now! - You can't do this! I told you it was going to fall, it's broken! It's all your fault! - My fault? Look here, elevator 4, south area, break 12. No sir, that's the elevator 1 from the north area. Listen up, the elevator from the north area has nothing to do with this problem. Turn off the elevator 4 south area, breaker 12 and that's it! Let's just turn both of them off. Tony, who the fuck turned off the breakers? Now the elevator is going down! I've had enough of this! Go fuck yourself you prick! You go fuck yourself! Calm the fuck down! - I'm tired, I won't even bother. You had to go in, maybe you had been cut in half, so stubborn... That little fucker! I'm so fucking mad right now, fuck! What's up with Amanda? This is fucking bullshit. Where the fuck are they now? Somebody has any signal at least? I don't have a single line. I think I do. Hello, Maria? How is my son doing? Yeah, I'm fine. How's my son? Tell me please. Okay... stay with him. Bye. How's your son? He's okay. He's with his grandma. - That's good. Now, don't tell me you girls don't have anybody else to call? I won't call Mario. For what? So that crazy bitch won't even let him talk to me? I won't call that prick of a husband I have, either. For what? He doesn't give fuck if I'm alive... or dead. Even so, I swear he's gonna have it when I'm out of here. I'll take the half of everything he has. My little bird must be sleeping. She's out all night long. Well, last thing I want to do is talk to any of those truckers when I'm out of here... I'm sick of them. What about you, pretty? Why don't you call anyone? Now you're all against me? Of course I have a lot of people to call, lots of them! Millions of them. Then call. Yeah... Chubby bunny? Hey there baby it's me! I... What's wrong? What happened? He was with his wife? She knows she can't call him. The only one who can call is him. Leave her alone already. As my dear Amanda said, none of the above. You know what's wrong? He's cheating up with me. I'm a high cost whore. And millionaires pay me 10,000 dollars to sleep with them. I make my living giving my back and with both legs wide open. Sometimes downwards. The second time, it's always on four legs, like a bitch. You're happy? So, so fancy... What do you mean? How do you do that? Let's leave it like that, shall we? No, it's okay. What do you want to know, Clarita? What do I feel? Nothing. I don't feel anything at all. You just program yourself... and when it's over, you program yourself over again. Like nothing happened at all. So it's true. You're not joking. Well, she ain't the only whore in the world. Don't call her like that! It's okay, it doesn't bothers me. I do lots of things. I have a wide menu. Hardcore stuff, Old men love it! Lesbianism... For old women, tired of always the same. You might like it too, Clara! I make threesomes, with people bored of their sex lives. That's almost 70% of my work flow. Lots of clients for birthdays, anniversaries... Valentine's day, even Christmas. And of course... who could forget... The kid becoming a man, thanks to his old man. Very special. But I make 10 to 15 grand monthly. That's how I pay my college. You're talking with a graduate in administration. And yeah... I spoil myself like a rich brat. No one holds me down... No jealous men... No violence... I fuck a big bad wolf anytime I want and I get the pleasure you don't get. Is it wrong? No, not at all! But if you have money and you're a graduate... Why don't you leave that lifestyle, get a good man and get married? A good man? Where are they? I haven't found any. Or maybe... an alternative? You're so over yourself! Alright, there are no good men. But why don't you quit? I tried once... I met a good man as you say. I tried to quit but... What do you do when you're out with your couple and you see a customer? Wait up. I'm about to drown, that's so amazing! That's amazing! It's just a ring... The amazing things will happen when you say the date. Really? It's just... My mom needs to know this! Hang on for a second! Hey. - Hi! What's up tiger? - All going well, how about you? Very good. Listen up... You're with that chick? You know her? Yes, of course! I hired her once. We made a threesome... I'm still getting over it! Are you talking about my girlfriend, Sabrina? The one I'm going to marry? Marry? That's a whore. Think about it. My grandma wants lots of pictures! Why did your buddy just ran away? You didn't knew him? No idea. One of your favorite clients. One who hired you... for a threesome. You forgot? That's why I left everything. I left my country... And I got here, to start over again. But you know, the story repeats itself. And once more, I understood that... If you get into this business... you will never leave. I'm so sick of these sad stories... Depressive shit, sad shit, I'm sick. I will get the fuck out of here, no matter what. I'm sick, sick of this shit! Sick, I'm sick. So it's true, we're going to stay here? Just look at that! Look at that baby! I'm getting out of here! This duct will get us out! Careful now! Are we leaving through where? Are you crazy? - Sister! Architecture is never wrong, I leave this must lead somewhere. Aren't you seeing too many movies? - Movies? A movie it's what we lived in the elevator. This must lead somewhere, I ain't dumb. Lola, you don't know where that leads to! - Shut up Clara, whoever wants to leave, come if not, take care, I'm out. - I leave too! Move it! A way out! Goodbye! Here, careful now. Wait, I have the fireman's number! Hello? Confirmed sir, visual contact with five women. Five women at the rooftop. Don't move, don't move. Stay there, we're coming. Keep calmed, please. Don't move, don't move, we're coming. Get ready, we're coming... Don't move. Who's first? You go Clara! Well... After several months, going around so stressed... I did a pretty crazy thing. - What? I slept with a guy for money, like Sabrina! Are you trying to be my competitor? And then what? Okay... Finally... I married a blue prince I met! And for the power bestowed upon me... I pronounce you man and wife. Alright, who's next? Go Amanda. Well girls... I... got a divorce. And I took the half! But you need to know, that thing about him having lots of money? Lies. But... what he had was enough, I opened my new business. A super cute spa. Check my account I dare you, I have more than 50 million pesos. And what's the name? - Chandelier. Isn't that the one in Arroyo Hondo? That's the one. Damn girl, you're doing super well, I want to go! You know it. Well now's my turn, I took Pablito and we hit it like an old school officer, I have him managing the business, the trucks, the inventory, everything! Do you want me to loose the kid? Can't you see what's going on behind you? Leave that to me baby, you'll see. Hey, what's going on there? I'm at peace finally, we even had a kid! What about you Olivia? - Well... I finally found my other half. A brunette, 6 and a half feet tall. Where would we be without the beautiful women? Isn't this the city of love and gay marriage? She's an amazon. Well and I... I'm remaking my life. Step by step... - That's good... With an incredible man who loves and adores me! And well, I'm still not 100% sure but I think it will work this time, because... I'm living in Paris! The love of my life is a french guy, who I believe... I'll tell him about my past some day and I will be at peace. Keep it up like that, baby. That's it! Okay ladies, let's make a toast! Cheers! Good afternoon. How do you do? Going up? - Yep. Hello. - Good afternoon. Hello. Where are you going? - 9th floor, please. Thanks. It's not moving. Did you push the button? Oh fuck... - Calm down... Just let me... Coming soon...
