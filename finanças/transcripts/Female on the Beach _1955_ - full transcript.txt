Did you hear what she said? She said she'd call the police. Yes. They make me so nervous. Do you... do you think she will go to the police? I mean, we can't allow that you know. Really we can't. Drummy. Drummy. Drummy. Don't go, Drummy. I won't go to the police. Darling, I'm... I'm sorry. Drummy. Drummy! Ah!! - Get this finished as quickly as you can. - Yes, ma'am, right away. That is probably Mrs Markham now. - Mrs Markham. Won't you come in. - Thank you. I recognized you from your pictures in the paper. - By the way, my luggage is in the car. - Walter, see to Mrs Markham's luggage. You are probably wondering who I am. I'm Amy Rawlinson. Rawlinson's Real Estate? Beach properties are our speciality. "Rawlinson gives you your day in the sun." We spoke on the phone. Remember? Yes. Yes, I do remember. We didn't expect you for a few days. We wanted to get it all cleaned up for you. Mrs Crandall only left last night. Mrs Crandall? Your tenant. The lady who had this house. I leased it to her for your husband's estate. I hope Mrs Crandall was a good tenant. Oh, yes. A quiet little old lady. Very nice. That's nice. - Would you like to see the kitchen? - Yes, I would. I understand you've never seen the house. That's right. This is it. Oh, I'm going to have a lot of fun in here. Too bad you never lived here. Mr Markham was very fond of this house. Before you were married. The dining room leads right out on to the terrace, too. It's really a lovely place. With a divine view. It is lovely. All that blue. And of course your own private beach and the pier. - That boat. Is that mine too? - No. That belongs to Drummy. Who? Drummond Hall, one of the neighbors. Mrs Crandall let him tie up there. Since Mrs Crandall doesn't live here any more, would you have him move it. Yes, I'll tell him. I should have told him before, but... With all the excitement, with you arriving and Mrs Crandall leaving, I... Was there any trouble? - Trouble? - Getting her to leave? Oh no, of course not. Her lease was up two months ago. She was just staying on from week to week. What are those men doing down there? I don't know exactly. Something to do with the government. Let me show you the rest of the house. You don't have to sell it to me. Even if I didn't own it, I'd buy it. Because it is so lovely. Mrs Crandall had a maid who came in four times a week. I took the liberty of keeping her on for you. How kind. Thank you. Will that be all, Miss Rawlinson? Yes, you can go. Have Walter pick up the check at my office, will you. Yes, ma'am. - Bye. - Goodbye. Mrs Crandall was a quiet little old lady, you said? Oh yes, very. She must have left in a hurry. Why do you say that? The quiet little old lady forgot her pipe. Oh that. That must belong to Drummy. - I told you about him, - Hmm. The neighbor? He lives closer than I thought. He also forgot his jacket. He's always leaving his things somewhere. He's so careless. He'll probably come around one of these days asking for them. Miss Rawlinson, I don't think I care for that. Instead, why don't you just see that everything is returned to him. Certainly, if you like. - I didn't know... - I'm sure you didn't. You might look around for other souvenirs while you are at it. You know, toothbrushes, shaving things. There won't be anything like that. I'm sure. Well, I have such a nasty imagination. If you don't mind, I'd like to be left alone with it. Do you plan to stay here long, Mrs Markham? I don't know. I came here to sell the house. Mrs Crandall wasn't a very good tenant. I'm sorry I lied to you. That's alright. I didn't believe you. - Good afternoon, Miss Rawlinson. - Good afternoon. Mrs Markham? Lieutenant Galley. Newport Police. I came up the stairs from the beach. - Alright. Why? - Don't you know? Mrs Crandall? All I know is that she left last night. She left this way. A swan dive off the top of a brandy bottle. Dead? Stone cold. Any comment? Yes. I'm getting a new real-estate agent. You mean Rawlinson didn't tell you about it, huh? Well, in her business they never tell anybody the sewer is stopped up. You can't blame her too much, Mrs Markham. How do you know who I am? I'm a beach Cop. I go around all day with my hat in my hand, sand in my shoes. Being polite to rich people with places like this who come here for a good time. And get mad when you ask questions. So I make it a point of knowing all the answers. I know all the answers about you, Mrs Markham. I doubt that. First name "Lynn". Formerly, a speciality dancer. Married seven years ago in Las Vegas to Ben Markham. Part time owner of a gambling joint and a full time crap-shooter. The marriage was not a notable success. Probably because you couldn't compete with the dice. And last, it's only a guess but there is more. Ben died about a year ago. You want me to go on or is that enough for a start? That's enough for a finish. However, I'll add to your file. I have two sisters. When we were little girls we all had to sleep in the same room. It was a very small room. I was never alone. That was something I grew up hungry for. Just to be alone. All by myself in a great big house like this one. I think I'm being thrown out. Just pushed a little. Well, I don't mind being pushed by a beautiful woman. I just came up to get another look at this terrace. It's not a very good diving board, is it. Mrs Crandall committed suicide, didn't she? That's what they say down at the office. You think differently? I'm not paid to think. I'm just supposed to go around and get sand in my shoes. If you don't mind, I'll go out through the front door. Just for kicks. Hey! Hey, you! Hey, you down there! Morning. Do you have to make all that noise this early in the morning? I do if you want this boat out of here. I was told to move it. Did I wake you? You did. I'm wide awake. Then you won't mind if I finish what I'm doing. I do mind. I want you to stop. Well, good morning. Oh, Mrs Markham. I'm Drummond Hall. I brought you something. A peace offering. Some fish I caught this morning. Hibiscus I picked from somebody's front yard down the road. Ours didn't bloom this year. Much too damp. What are you doing here? Besides waking people up? Whenever I wake up a beautiful girl, I always give her breakfast. Anyway, I'm the only one who can make this thing operate. You see, there is a leg missing. Here... here's the magic. - How do you like your coffee? - Alone. Strong coffee. I'll bet all your friends say you have a wonderful way with people. Yeah, and they're right. People like me. Not everybody. Why, it takes all kinds. There we are. You... like to go fishing? No. Well, skin-diving maybe? We could... Go for lobsters. I don't like lobsters. I have a long list of dislikes. It's getting longer. I... I understand you own this place. There seems to be doubt about that at the moment. - How do you like your toast? - Medium. Would you mind telling me how you got in here? I have a key. One or two slices? I'm glad I didn't know that last night. I never come in at night. Unless asked. Don't worry. Living so close. My aunt and uncle are just next door. We're friendly with everyone who lives here. Hasn't it ever crossed your friendly little mind... That there have been a few changes made around here? Nothing really changes very much. Oh? Well. I guess that's about all I can do for you. Right now. You are so right, Mr Hall. In future I will try to struggle through breakfast without your assistance. Now suppose you just amble back to that little boat of yours, huh? It's got a busted fuel pump. It will be a day or two before I can get it out. Oh no. I don't suppose it's ever occurred to you to have it towed away? No. No it hasn't. Say, how would you like to run out to one of the islands with me? In a broken boat? What happens if a... a storm comes up? I'm a very good swimmer. - I'm not. - I'd save you. I meant after the boat has been fixed. You'd like the islands. I was on an island once. They all look alike. Round. There must be some way in which I can amuse you. May I please have the key? Wouldn't you know it. Just when we were getting acquainted. Maybe he'll go away. Here, I'll get it. Wait a minute. I don't want some strange man answering my door at this hour. What do you mean, "strange"? They all know me around here. Besides, you don't want anybody to see you like that. - Are you looking for something? - Miss Rawlinson. Amy Rawlinson? She's not here. You'll probably find her in her office. Well it's about the clothes and things. We had to ship them back. I'm Mrs Markham. This is my house. What clothes do you mean? Miss Rawlinson said they would be ready. The dead woman's clothes. - Oh. Mrs Crandall, you mean? - Yes, ma'am. You know about her? I'd be getting quite a shock now if I didn't. Amy asked us not to say. She thought it might upset you, moving in like this. She was right. Now, do you mind if I have that key back? Things are at my place down the beach. You moved them? Nothing's been taken. Come, I'll get them for you. Mister Hall. The key. - Sorry to disturb you, ma'am. - That's quite alright. Amy is such a fool. She should have told her Mrs Crandall is dead. She's bound to find out anyway. Osbert, do help. You know this needs two people. Just give it a good shake and plunge it into the sand. It's better in the sand they tell me. And have you noticed the way Amy's been looking at us? I'm sure she thinks we pushed poor Eloise. Anyway Drummy. It's all your fault. If you'd worked a little faster on Eloise, we wouldn't be in this fix. At least you could have kept her away from the brandy. The old witch. Breaking her neck just when we were about to make a dollar out of her. After we'd waited so long. I hate to speak evil of the dead but... it was most inconsiderate of her. Nah, nah. Not over your face, dear. It spoils that gorgeous tan. And we have quite an investment in your tan. Yes, with everything going out and nothing coming in. I saw Pete Gomez yesterday. That fishing-boat person? He's back in business. Still talking about a partnership. He's got a good boat. Now you mustn't be wasteful of your talents, Drummy. Fishing for pleasure is all very well. But as a business, dead fish leave something to be desired. You owe it to yourself to enjoy the better things. And to us, dear. Our new widow is positively choked with money. Amy Rawlinson tells me the husband had investments in Las Vegas. I have a great respect for investments. And the poor thing must be so lonely. It may be an act of goodness for you to offer her your friendship. All of it. Perhaps the boy doesn't care for her, my dear. It happens that she's very attractive and... quite handy. I do hope she will be coöperative. Eloise joined us the very first day. And... left rather suddenly, too. I'm going for a swim. That's a dear boy. And investments make for such a splendid marriage. Uhuh. Don't press, my dear. One little mistake and we've lost him. Stop interrupting my dreams. And after the marriage, if Mrs Markham would just pass away... As conveniently as Eloise did. Bloody Mary? Thank you, dear. Hi. Did you get settled alright? All in good shape, thank you. You won't have trouble about me again. I've learnt how to work the coffee pot. That's no trouble at all. I... I want to explain about this morning. I understand. It's quite alright. Hey... you're beginning to burn. I feel fine, thank you. I bet you're one of the people who don't know they're hurt until it's too late. Where did you get this vast knowledge of people? Right here on the beach. Relax... you might grow to like it. I like it and what I like, everybody likes. You must go with the house like the plumbing. Oh now, don't get nasty. It's just my standard service. You might as well know, I'm not the standard type. Okay, I... I know when I'm not getting through. Reading? "To Stand Naked In The Sun". Is that what you want to do? It's a poem. Why are you so angry with me? I'm not anything with you. And I prefer to keep it that way. - I'd like to think we could be friends. - Why? - Well, for a starter, you... - Look... Why don't you stop pressing. Mrs Crandall might have been interested in your product. But Mrs Markham is not. You're taking an awful lot for granted aren't you? Strange. I was thinking the same thing about you. Why? Just because I'm being friendly? You're about as friendly as a suction-pump. Look, Mrs Markham. Whatever kind of life you've led up to now must have left out the simple things. Like people helping one another. Maybe they don't understand that where you come from. As for Eloise, she wasn't very happy and I'm sorry she's dead. If you have any other questions, I'll be glad to answer them. No. None. Now what are you thinking about? I was thinking that I don't like you particularly. And I was wondering why. And I was thinking that I don't like to be stared at either. And I know why. Why can't we be friends? This is one very good reason. I don't like being handled. Ah, but you're lonely. I know you are. You're cold. Let me warm you. I hope you don't bruise easily. I'm not enjoying this. Mrs Markham. - How did you get in here? - I used my key. Well, the one I have to show the place. By the time I collect all the keys on this beach I'll feel like a locksmith. May I have yours? Certainly. - I meant to tell you about Mrs Crandall. - Forget it. Your friend Drummy has already made a weak explanation. I suppose you're wondering why I came today. Not at all. I've got used to the traffic. - I've a buyer for the house. - Good. A Mr Schmidt from Milwaukee. He saw the house about a month ago and just fell in love with it. He wired today and said he'd take it. At your price. How much did he send as a binder? As a "binder"? A deposit, money. You know, evidence of good faith. Oh, a "binder". Yes, that's the ugly word I've been using. Well, Mr Schmidt is a man of his word. As soon as I got the wire, I took the house off our list. You'd better put it back on again. There's really nothing to worry about. They're one of the wealthiest families in the mid-west. In that case, it shouldn't be difficult to get a deposit. - I'll try. - You do that. Miss Rawlinson, I think the house would look tidier if I had the railing fixed. And incidentally, your friend still has his boat tied up at my pier. Will you take care of that too? I'm sorry. I'm afraid all this has made a bad impression on you, Mrs Markham. Certainly not. Suicide, police, lies, charm-boy, people walking in and out. Things like that only make a house look more lived in. I guess you'd like to be left alone. That's something I've wanted for such a long time. - Do you mind? - Of course not. - Goodbye. - Bye. - How many? - Fill the main tank, will you. - That will take about 30 gallons, Drummy. - Put it on the book. I've been carrying you so long my feet are getting flat. Charge it to me, Jack. Okay, Miss Rawlinson. Well, maybe I'm glad I ran into you. I've got to talk you, Drummy. Just for a little while, huh? I'll be nice. Really I will. You'll see. Come on, just while they're filling your tank, huh? I hope it’s worth it. Well, start shouting. Why haven't I seen you? You haven't even phoned. I can't figure out how to work the dial. Anyway, I've been busy. Why? Eloise isn't around anymore to take up your time. You said you'd be nice. How about it? Look, I don't want to make a scene every time I see you, but... You act as though nothing ever happened between us. It never did. It could have. You liked me once. Sure, for about ten minutes one gin evening. Look, do we have to go over it? We almost got together but we didn't. A miss is as good as a mile. Let's just forget about it. Besides, it's too late. I have other things to think about. And I know what. I was up at the house this morning. I saw what went on down at the pier with Mrs Markham. You also saw that she didn't get my message. She asked me again about you mooring in her dock. She doesn't want you there. You've been talking to her about me? The other way round. Why? You afraid of what I'll tell her? Oh Drummy, what's the matter? I won't make any demands on you. That's what you're afraid of, isn't it? Becoming involved like with all the others? I'm not that kind of a woman. - I would leave you alone. - Then why don't you? Alright... start it all over again with Lynn Markham. And maybe you'll leave a few more dead ones before you're through. Now, you listen to me. Don't talk about Eloise. I don't want you to mention her again. Not to me or anybody else. You'll forget I even know your name. Do you understand? You couldn't love anybody. You hate women. All of us. I don't hate women, I just... Hate the way they are. Good evening. I got your message. I'll have the boat out in the morning. Not too early. I'll make sure you're awake. Where are you going to dock it now? Wherever I can talk somebody into letting me leave it for free. And if you don't find a place? Then I'll throw it away. What's that? The fuel pump. I need a new one. Why? Because this one doesn't work. Why don't you try a little charm on it? Keep your opinions to yourself, and how about letting me fix this, huh? Is it that important? Not if you don't mind getting killed. Sometimes they blow up and there's a fire. Or if you're real lucky, there's a storm and you simply drown. Why don't you get a new one? Don't they make them anymore, or are you broke? They make them alright. Okay. You can leave your boat here for a few days. But don't work on it while I'm sleeping. Thanks, I... Think I'll move it. It's getting kind of crowded around here. It's smaller than I thought. It sleeps two. Who is the couple? Osbert and Queenie. The Sorensons from next door. Oh yes, your... Your aunt and uncle. Not really. They give me a place to sleep and... Some money in exchange for part of my time. Which part? The part I gave Mrs Crandall. You're very frank. Why not? I figure you know all the answers. Anyhow, I don't care anymore. That's Mrs Crandall. Eloise. Taken when she still had ideas of marrying me. - Would you have married her? - If she had money. She could have given me what I want. What do you want? Nothing. Nothing to worry about. Nothing to struggle for. Nothing to bother about. That kind of nothing costs money. So they tell me. You wanted to get it the easy way? No, I wouldn't have called Eloise the... Easy way exactly. Just quick. You don't seem to have any illusions about the soft and gentle sex. They're not soft. And they're not gentle. Have you always been on the beach like this? No. I... Began as a poor and simple fisherman. I went downhill from there. Pete Gomez. He was my partner. By working hard and saving our money. It only took us three years to go broke. And after that? After that Osbert and Queenie came along. I had this old boat and they hired me to take them on a cruise. We became friends. They helped me when I needed help. I owe them a lot and I like to pay my debts. I was rude this morning. Not that you didn't deserve it. But I... Well, I haven't been much good with people for some time. I forgive you. Hey, you'll... Get grease on you. Will I? See, I was right. I left a mark on you. You would leave a mark on anyone. I wish I could afford you. Why don't you save your pennies? Maybe I will. In the meantime, don't move your boat. Alright. - It's you again. - Yeah. Looks like my only mission in life is to frighten you. One way or another. That's right. What is it now, Lieutenant? Nothing special, thanks. Just gum-shoeing a little. Only to close the files on Mrs Crandall. - Must you gumshoe at night? - Cigarette? Yes, thank you. Maybe it's just my excuse for seeing you again. Still, she did go over his railing that night. I was just curious to see what she might have been looking at. Why she might have fallen against it, and snapped it off. But that wouldn't be easy. The railing isn't that weak, is it? No. And she wasn't that heavy. Unless she'd been thrown against it. Or pushed. You've been reading too many detective stories, Lieutenant. I like them. They give me ideas. Like... Suppose she was leaning against the railing. A steady pressure. Leaning out to look down at something or someone on the beach. Lieutenant! I see Drummond Hall still keeps his boat here. Well, I won't take up any more of your time, Mrs Markham. Thank you. You're very serious, aren't you. You talk as if a crime really had been committed here. Maybe I do read too many detective stories. Just for my sake, do me a favor. - Be careful. - Of what? This naturally. What else? And give my regards to Drummy. He's very tall, isn't he. Goodnight, Mrs Markham. She's there. On the terrace. Don't you think it would be nice if you made contact again? Just a tiny little effort. We do have a fiscal problem, darling. Anything would be appreciated. Exactly what for instance? Well you see we're lonesome people, and we do like company. A nice game of cards to while away a few hours. Cards. Oh, what a wonderful idea. Osbert, however did you think of such a way to bring cheer to a lonely evening? Hello? Hello, Mrs Markham? Yes. - "This is Mrs Sorenson." - Is it? Queenie Sorenson. Drummy's aunt. Yes, Mrs Sorenson? We've heard so much about you from Drummy. That I thought I'd call and ask if you won't come over for dinner this evening. And perhaps a little game of cards or something? "We just won't take no for an answer." I wouldn't dream of saying no to you, Mrs Sorenson. Good. Arrivederci, then. Au revoir. "Another listless morning." "But such a pleasant surprise this afternoon." "A young man, one of the neighbors, brought me a bouquet." "A welcoming gift." "I'm invited to dine with his aunt and uncle." I'll see you. Three Queens. Three eights. "We played cards after dinner." "But my mind wasn't on the game." "I lost eighty dollars." "And found how good it is to feel young again." "Drummy walked me home along the sand." "We made a date to swim together tomorrow." "Lie in the sun." "How long it has been since I collected my thoughts." "Or wanted to." "I'm drifting in happiness." "Each week with Drummy is a new delight." "I love him." "I love him desperately." "Queenie visited me tonight." "Asking for another loan." "For Drummy's sake, I gave her five hundred dollars." "That make twenty-four hundred altogether." "Not counting my gambling losses." "Drummy promised to come this evening." "He's late." "I wish he were here now." "I learned today that Miss Rawlinson cannot renew my lease." - Isn't there some way...? - I'm sorry, Mrs Crandall... The owner is coming back. There is nothing I can do. - "I must leave here soon." - I'm sorry. "Drummy didn't come last night." "Not even a phone call today." "Dear God, I hope he isn't tired of me." "Oh Drummy. Drummy. I could forgive you for anything... If you'd just come away to Los Angeles with me. "I begged him to come with me." "The way he acted." "I knew he never loved me." "He never even cared for me." "The money I gave Queenie and Osbert was all he wanted." At least I must know about this big game they've got going... With you right in the middle as the jackpot. "He was so angry he frightened me." Drummy! Drummy! "My last night in the house." "Drummy phoned to say he's coming here." I shouldn't have threatened him with the police "I hate him." "I hate him." "No I don't." "I love him." "I don't care. I don't care about anything but him." "He mustn't see me like this." "Just one more drink and then I'll put my make-up on." This one is mine, I hope. The door was open. You'd better get that lock fixed. What are you doing here? We're supposed to have a date, remember? Dinner? Some other time. I... I cancelled the Sorensons. I told them we'd rather be alone. It's very late and as you can see, I'm not dressed. That's alright with me. I'll help with the buttons. Okay... I won't help with the buttons. Hey. I thought you were through being upset with me. Come on. Hurry up and get dressed up. I'll take you to dinner and tell you all about myself. I'd like to hear that. I might tell you a few things, too. It sounds like a gay evening. It won't be dull. I promise you that. I'll be ready in a minute. See who that is, will you. I think I know who it is. I thought I told you to forget about this evening. Oh my dear chap, we know you couldn't be serious. Even if you did shout at us. We haven't even met Mrs Markham yet, socially or otherwise. And it's so selfish of you to want to keep her all to yourself. It's not like you. So here we are and you're forgiven, naughty boy. Yes, of course you are. Lynn and I have a date and you're not going to interfere. After all you did see me first, didn't you. Oh... you're Mrs Markham, of course. - And we're the... - Yes. Yes. I know who you are. Well you see, when Drummy said that he was... Well, we just couldn't dare not meeting you. So here we are. I was curious myself. About you. Now that I've met you, everything is complete. I wouldn't have missed it for anything. Go on. I'd like to ask you to stay and have a drink. But I'm afraid you might accept. Did you...? Not a word. I must have misunderstood, the silly fool that I am. Yes, you are silly aren't you. Why. You're deliberately insulting us. And that isn't easy, is it. Imagine wasting a whole afternoon marking a deck of cards. By the way, did you bring them with you? You needn't feel badly. It wouldn't have done you any good. Because you see on rainy afternoons... My husband used to amuse me and himself by showing me the tricks of your trade. He was a professional gambler, too. I have an uneasy feeling that our honesty is being questioned. I think we're being asked to leave. So do I. Would you like us to go? As far as you like. Another continent, preferably. Au revoir, then. Arrivederci. Now me? Now you. Has... Has Amy been talking to you? No, I had a better reference. Eloise Crandall. I found her diary. She. Paid me compliments I didn't deserve. Her lover had the instincts of a stallion and the... Pride of an alley cat. Eloise is... A very emotional woman. She had her reasons, didn't she. I hope we can discuss her reasons in a civilized way. Well. There goes civilization and... A good Martini. You were made for your profession alright. All very nicely put together. Nice to look at. Nice to touch. The great god of the senses, sparkling on the beach. Until you remember that sewers empty in to the ocean. I wouldn't have you if you were hung with diamonds upside down! I don't recall ever asking you to. Oh yes you did. In your way. And I went along with it for a while. Just for laughs. When it comes to phonies like you, I wrote the book. You're lonely. I know you are. You're cold. Let me warm you. You might at least have rewritten the dialogue when you tried it out on me! You got me all figured out, haven't you. Neatly dissected and put away in cubbyholes marked: "Drummond Hall. How he ticks." You bet I have. And I'm sorry to spoil your record, lover boy. But I'm not as starved as Eloise. And thank heavens I'm not interested in you. Yes you are. - Let go of me. - No. - I said let go of me! - And I said no. Not until I shake some of those stupid ideas out of your pretty head. If you don't let go of me, I'll call the police. That's right. Be afraid of me. A little afraid, at least. A woman is no good to a man unless she's a little afraid of him. No... no! - Good morning. - Good morning. - The coffee is still hot. - Hmm? In the kitchen. I'm Mrs Murchison. Day work. Did Amy Rawlinson tell you about me? Yes, I expected you last week. No, I was sick last week. Oh... I found this on the terrace. And do you want to return these cuff-links to Mr Hall? I found them under the table when Mrs Crandall was here. It's very quiet around here. What did you say? I said Mr Hall seems to spend a great deal of time around here. He did, I suppose. What do you mean "suppose"? I go home nights. But darling, look at these bills. We've really got to do something. The least you could do is call Mrs Markham up. Leave the boy alone, Queenie. It's only been three days since he last saw her. Give her enough time to really miss him. Yes? Mrs Markham? Lieutenant, you really are making a habit of frightening me. Why didn't you answer when I called? I just got here. You mean... Just this minute? Yes. I was walking along the beach. What's this? I just found it on the steps. It's a shark hook. It could give you a nasty cut. You should be more careful, Mrs Markham. There are a lot of dangerous things on the beach. - Meaning? - You know how it is. We have some... Characters in a community like this. A lone female on the beach is a kind of a target. Bait you might say, for a... hook like this. Lieutenant. You're not protecting me, are you? I mean... All this wandering about this late...? Nothing as dramatic as that. Somebody reported some kind of a disturbance along the shore here. You didn't happen to notice anything, did you? Probably isn't important. But as long as I'm here, I'll wait until I hear your door close. Thank you. Hello? "Is Jack there?" You have the wrong number. Who's there? Is someone there? Anything wrong, Mrs Markham? The lock is broken. Probably from so many people coming in and out. What do you want? Mr Schmidt has sent the check. Who? What check? The binder that you requested. On the house. He hopes to move in by the first of the month. The way I feel, he can move in today. Hello? Has it been that long? I hadn't noticed. I missed you, too. Today? Well, I... I have a million things to do, and I... Half an hour? I'm not... Not sure I could be ready. Twenty minutes? Alright. Alright, I'll be ready. Yes. Here is the check. I'll have the papers in a day or so. The papers? For the sale of the house. Oh that? Oh forget it. But I've already accepted the check. Then send it back, darling! I wouldn't dream of giving up this beautiful house. I... Love it. Come on. That's enough. Well, I guess I'd better think about getting some clothes on, huh? Oh, I'm broad-minded. Yeah, but... I'm shy. Ha ha. Certainly. I've noticed that. Sorry I couldn't pick out a nicer day for you. This one is nice enough. Why did you wait so long to call me? I never meant to get serious about you. I was thinking it over. What... did you decide? I'm not smiling. - I am. - Well, that's settled. What will we talk about now? Let's talk about you. You said you were a poor and simple fisherman. Before that? Before that I was a poor and simple child. When I was a ten years old... I went into one of those institutions known sentimentally as an orphanage. After that, I saw the world. Then came the war. Then my friend Gomez in the fishing business. Then Osbert and Queenie. Why do you stay with them? I don't know. Maybe because... I'm different from other people and they don't care. How different? Different enough so that I'm... Not a very nice guy sometimes. Maybe... maybe it's good not to be like everybody else. To... be your own person. You didn't like me very much at first, did you. No. No. Now, I... like you. I'm not worth getting hurt for. You won't hurt me, darling. I won't let you. Won't you? I won't hurt you, either. Like she did. I'm sure it was a woman. And she was young and beautiful and... so terribly in love with you. Then one day, she let you kiss her. Hold her tightly in her arms. And the next day you were gone. Is that the reason she did it? No. Who was she? My mother. Just before she killed herself. Oh, I'm... I'm so sorry. Forget it. - But I didn't know. - Forget it. I have, nearly. What about you? Your husband? Ben was older than I was, and... Rich. That counted for a lot at first. Does that shock you? In my kind of house, throwing stones isn't allowed. I didn't know very much when I met him. What I knew, I knew well. He gave me everything, taught me everything. And in his way, he loved me. That was the second most important thing in the world to me. What's first? To love somebody yourself. With fire instead of warmth. With all your heart and all your being. Just once. Just once to love like that. A real heart tug. He must have what it takes. Putting the arm on him now? No, not yet. She's going to marry you? But however did you manage it? - I told her I loved her. - Ha, my dear chap. What an imagination. It's true and I'm leaving you. Why? I caught a slight case of decency. It's gone to my head. How wretched. And how was this bizarre sensation provoked? I realized something today. I can live like anybody else. Bur dear boy, you're not like anybody else. Where do you propose to go? I'll live on Pete Gomez's boat until Lynn and I are married. I see. Then into the house, huh? Rich wife. Big home. Well, you've certainly hit the jackpot, Drummy. But how selfishly. I'm in love with her. But what about us? We're not young, you know. Not young at all. You could provide for us. You'll be rich after you're married. We're finished, Queenie. Whatever I was, I'm not that anymore. You can't change, Drummy. You can't. And you know it. Drummy. Oh... Let him go, Queenie. We're better off without him. A dangerous young man since Eloise's death. It might even be wise to do something about it. To avoid a repetition of that... Previous occurrence. You know if I could get any price at all for my boat, I'd make the deal. What's that? Never mind. Okay. Pete's fixed it so that I can pay the rest out of the profits. He's a good friend. Yeah. Better than I deserve. That's a terrible thing to say. It's the truth. I haven't been much good up to now. The past is buried under a lot of dead years. We're starting all over again. Just the two of us. I want to be alone with you. Nobody else. Just the beginning of things. That can be arranged. Especially the being alone. Well, what is it? Open it. A fuel pump. Pleased? You just bought yourself a honeymoon cruise. I'll pull the boat out of the water, fix it up, and then we go anywhere we like. Just the two of us. Just the two of us. - You remember me, Lieutenant Galley? - Oh yes, how are you. You watch next door. Is there something I can do, Lieutenant? Yes. A funny thing happened today. I thought I'd ask your advice about it. Someone called my office and said it might be a good idea... To question Drummond Hall about the death of Eloise Crandall. Whoever it was that called wouldn't leave their name. Why not? Are you saying it was I who called? Are you saying it wasn't? Going somewhere? End of the season, you know. Follow the sun. Follow the sun. Well, I wouldn't follow it without my permission if I were you. Now, suppose we all sit down real nice and have a good long talk... About Eloise Crandall and Drummond Hall. Oh no. We'd rather not be involved in all this sordidness... If at all possible. You should have thought of that before you called my office. What happens to Drummond Hall, happens to you, too. Sit down. - Thank you. I told you so. 200, 150, a grand total of $1,280 from Mrs Crandall to you in seven weeks. Gambling losses, that's all. This isn't Las Vegas. From now on, if I even hear of you buying a deck of cards... You'd better unpack. I'll let you know when you can leave. But we hate it here. It's better than jail. You know, I'm inclined to agree with him. - Good afternoon, Mrs Markham. - Hello, Lieutenant. - Hall, do you remember me? - Hmm. Hi. Is there something I can do for you? We can talk about it inside a lot better. Come in. You wanted to talk to me? No. To our friend here. About Eloise Crandall. - Does it have to be here, right now? - Does that bother you? Maybe you don't want Mrs Markham to know about you and the Crandall woman? I know all about her. Mr Hall told me. Then he shouldn't mind a few questions. Like what, for instance? Miss Crandall had a little money, I gather. She had more than a little. The Sorensons got some of it. How much did you get? Are you accusing me... Eloise Crandall had a whole catalog of violent attitudes towards you. She threatened you, loved you, hated you. Anyway you looked at her, she was plenty of trouble. According to your former friends the Sorensons, you saw her that night. A little while later, she was dead. That's their story. What's yours? I never took a dime from her. Not that she didn't offer. She wanted to be better friends than I wanted to be. The night she died, we... Had an argument. She made a scene and I walked out. That's all. Didn't anyone see you leave? Yeah. Eloise Crandall. Wise guy. How I hate a wise guy. I'm not in love with you either. If you've got something on me, get moving with it. Otherwise, this conversation is over. I've got work to do on my boat, so I'm leaving. Just like that? - Yeah, watch me. I'll call you. I'm sorry about this. You know of course, I don't believe it. It doesn't bother me. It bothers me, a lot. How dare you question him in front of me. Every time I turn around you're playing cops and robbers. Sneaking in and out of my house. Climbing up and down my stairs. It amused me for a while. But it's no longer funny. Now why don't you take your hat in your hand, your sand in your shoes... And go and play in somebody else's yard? I've had it, Galley. Lieutenant Galley. I'm a little bit old-fashioned. Then let me bring you up to date, Lieutenant. It might interest you to know that Mr Hall and I are getting married. Maybe that's why I did it this way. I don't get it. The whole thing. I don't get it. You will. I mean about Hall. Putting him on a grill without an arrest. You're warning him that we're moving towards him. A guy like that, if you put pressure on him he's likely to do most anything. I told you you'd get it. Is that you, Lynn? Not it isn't me, Lynn. It's me, Amy. - Got a drink? - Only water. That isn't what I had in mind. I'm trying to drown my sorrows. I just came from aunt Queenie and uncle Osbert. Bless their stunted little souls. They have some pretty bitter things to say about you, my boy. I don't owe them anything. No. With you, it all goes as merry as a marriage bell. Congratulations. What are you building, Amy? What do you want from me? I'll always be here. Go on, take the rich one. You won't forget me so easy. [ Knocking noises ] [ Knocking noises ] Morning. Ah, I woke you up? It's a lovely day for a wedding. Yeah, that's what I was thinking. Shall we? We'd better. How's the boat working? Fine. You want to go and see? I can't. I'm not dressed. Think of something else. Alright, I'll... I'll make some coffee. I'll beat you if you don't. Hello, Mrs Murchison. Excuse me. Well, what do you want? A cigarette, hmm? Mrs Murchison, we'll clean up later. - Yes, ma'am. Well, how does it feel to win first prize? You must be very happy, Mrs Markham. You're in love with him. Everybody but you knew that. Oh. So this is where the loser tells the winner she's making a terrible mistake? On the way out, think of something original, will you. You call this a marriage? He's marrying you for your money, and only for your money. You'll have him for a while until it's gone. Then, when he's got what he wanted you'll be... Just another Eloise to him. I've made worse investments. And when the money has run out, what then? If you've saved your pennies, then you can put in a bid for him. I haven't got the price. Around here, love has a very low cash surrender value. He's not like that. Only the money, I mean. Don't you tell me what he's like. I've seen every side of him. The side you don't even know about. I'm sorry you're still in love with him. I'm afraid you'll just have to get over it. Goodbye. And if you're up to it, come to the wedding. That might be a good time to start getting over it. They say the medicine that tastes the worst is the best for you. By the way. When the Minister asks if there's a reason you cannot be joined in Holy matrimony. Don't be surprised if somebody at the back of the room mentions a reason. Loud, clear and unpleasant. We really did get married, didn't we. Well, I... I thought it was a lovely wedding. - Darling. - Hmm. Everybody is leaving. Why don't we? Where to? Catalina. Any place... on the boat. Tonight instead of the morning? Why not? It looks pretty rough out. You'll be safe with me. Besides, the boat is fine now that I've got the fuel pump. I'll call the coastguard and check the weather. How about it? Anything you want. You're not wanted here. But dear boy we just dropped around to tell you how happy we were. I said you're not wanted. Drummy, please let's not have any misunderstandings on your wedding day. Mrs Hall, we only came to offer our good wishes. We're just leaving. But we wanted you to know that our thoughts were with you tonight. Thank you. I appreciate that. My husband does, too. Oh yes, of course. Well, arivederci then. Oh, Roddy. Roddy, the car please. Roddy. Roddy's our new friend. Such a dear, clever boy. Say hello to the bride and groom, Roddy. Hello. He's such a bright lad. Goodbye. Nighty-night, then. Good lucky, anyhow. Oh no, darling. I love you. That's the first time you've ever said that. Who is that? It's me... Rawly. Yes, Miss Rawlinson? I came by to say how sorry I was about this afternoon. You should be. I know it's considered noble to accept apologies, but... I'm afraid I'm not the noble type. - I don't blame you. I said a lot of foolish and stupid things. I hope you didn't pay any attention to me. Obviously not. I was married this afternoon. It was childish of me to be so upset. And the crazy things I said... Please forget. For what it's worth to you, I understand how you feel. And I won't mention the incident to anyone. Especially my husband. I think that's what you really mean, isn't it? Yes... and... Will you tell Drummy from me that... I wish him every success. Success? Ah, that's a strange choice of word. Usually newlyweds are wished "happiness". Usually... not always. Goodnight, Mrs Markham. "Hall". Goodnight. - Night. "What happens if a storm comes up?" - "I'm a very good swimmer." - "I'm not." "I'd save you." "His attention, his niceness was just a trick." "The money I gave Queenie and Osbert was all he wanted." "Not if you don't mind getting killed." "Sometimes they blow up and there's a fire." "Of if you're real lucky there's a storm and you simply drown." "He was so angry he frightened me." "Don't tell me about him." "I've seen every side of him." "The sides you don't even know about." "That's right. Be afraid of me." "A little afraid of me at least." "A woman is no good to a man unless she's afraid of him." "Afraid of him, Lynn." "Afraid of him, Lynn." "Lynn." "Lynn." "Lynn." "Lynn!" Lynn! Lynn! Coming. What were you doing? Putting our things on the boat. I thought perhaps you'd gone off on our honeymoon all by yourself. No. Hey, you're cold. Come inside. There is nothing more romantic than sleeping aboard a boat. We'll get a good start and anchor somewhere. Yes. Dawn on the sea... just... Just the two of us alone. Ah, but it will be fun. Something to remember. Hey, what's the matter with you? You're tired. I'll fix that. No... really, I... Come on now, you drink this. Of course you're tired. With all the excitement and everything today. Darling, your sweater. Here, I'll get a towel. It's alright, don't bother. I'll take care of it. Operator... give me Coast Guard weather information. Coastguard? Weather report for small craft. Worst? Thank you. I'll take it in here. Lieutenant Galley's office. Lieutenant Galley. It's urgent. Sorry, the Lieutenant isn't in tonight. I may be able to reach him. Would you care to leave a message? Yes. Yes please. Please tell him to call Mrs Markham. The name is "Mrs Hall". Of course. I'll get used to it. Hello? Hello? Mrs Markham? Hello? Lynn, you don't mind starting on our trip tonight, do you? Should I? I had a special reason for wanting to go right now. But. But there are certain things I want to get straight in your mind. Before you hear them from somebody else. What "things"? Osbert and Queenie wanted me to marry you. You know why. Money. Yeah. Didn't you mean any of it? Sure I did. But I didn't love you. Everything I'm not... Seemed sort-of underlined after I met you. I needed you. But we're married now. Why didn't you tell me this before? I guess I didn't have the courage. What gives you the courage now? I have fallen in love with you. You don't have to lie to me. I don't believe you. Ah, I don't even care anymore. I just want you to get out. Lynn, darling. What are you trying to say? I found the fuel pump. By accident, but I found it. You didn't use my gift, did you. Perhaps you would have preferred something more valuable. Can you please tell me what you're talking about? The boat. With the broken fuel pump. Broken so we could go out into that storm and have an accident. Only one of us would come back. But it wouldn't be me. That's what Amy meant, wishing you success. Success with murder! Will you... It rang like that the night Eloise died. Only nobody answered, then. I was here in the room. I let it ring that night. Not tonight. Hello? Yes. My wife called. Yes, just a while ago. About a prowler. Yes, I'm sure she sounded upset. You... know how women are. No. Don't worry. I'll see that she's well taken care of. No. No! No! Lynn! Lynn! Lynn! Lynn! - Where is Lynn? - Gone. Where? If she had any sense, she's drowned herself. Lynn! You were going to kill her anyway, weren't you? Lynn! Lynn! Lynn! I didn't count on her being such a fool. I thought I'd have to depend on the fuel pump. What do you know about the fuel pump? It was really very simple. I could even hear part of the wedding ceremony as I worked. I switched them. You switched them? Why? I knew she was a poor swimmer and you're a good one. I knew you'd be alright. You wanted to kill her. I told you I'd never let another woman have you. With Eloise, it was just like an accident. She didn't see the chair I turned over in front of her. I had to kill Eloise. I had to kill Lynn. Where is she? Where is Lynn? It's alright, Drummy. She won't last. Now you'll have everything you wanted. It's so easy. Just like Eloise. Lynn! Lynn! Drummy! It's alright. Drummy, listen to me. It's alright, I tell you. I saw her running toward the house. I did it for you, Drummy! Drummy! Lynn. Lynn, let me in. Lynn, you don't understand. Lynn, listen to me. Please listen. Lynn, will you just listen to me. Lynn, wait. Please. Please listen to me. It was Amy. The fuel pumps... she's The one who changed them. Lynn. I don't blame you for what you thought. I understand now. But let me explain. Explain what? Why you killed Eloise. Why you wänt to kill me. I... I didn't kill Eloise. Please... please, Lynn. Don't touch me. Don't touch me! It's alright. It's alright. Darling. Please forgive me. It's alright now. You're alright. I know. Oh, please forgive me. T-G
