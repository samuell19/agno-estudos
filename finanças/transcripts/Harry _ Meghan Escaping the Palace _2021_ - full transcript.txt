Please. Help me. Someone wanted to say morning to his daddy. He wouldn't take no for an answer. He's just like his mother then. Ah. Another bad dream? Yeah. In this one I proposed, but you turned me down flat. Oh wow. Talk about a nightmare. You've been having a lot of bad dreams, H? And now I've woken up. It's time to celebrate. In England we do it in March, but you're a Yank so... Happy American Mother's Day. Pula, did you have something to do with this? It was Guy. He helped me set it up last night after you went to bed. Over here, it's customary to give your wife an eternity ring when she's given you a child. Didn't you already get married? Happy Mother's Day. Thank you. Oh, best gift ever. Doria: Hello. Oh, a little jazz. Archie loves jazz. - That's what I've been told. - Yeah. Happiness starts... Love you. Thank you. Just put one on and your troubles will be gone Because happiness starts with a smile This is American music, yes. Pardon me, Your Highness. When you're sad Sir Briggs. Here on a Sunday? What's wrong? I am so sorry, Your Highness. When will it stop? The journalist who tweeted this has been fired from the BBC but... Buckingham Palace won't respond. If Buckingham Palace won't do it, I want a joint statement from Kensington Palace. Prince William and Prince Harry stand united against racism. Your brother's people have already said that this is nonsense and should just be ignored. Again, I mean, they, they seem to think it'll just go away. A direct shot at our son. It's hate speech. This just proves what we've been saying all along. Archie's going to need protection like my father's other grandchildren. More, thanks to the vitriol they continue to allow the press to spew. The palace would prefer you to remain neutral, as is tradition. I thought it was tradition to support your family when they're under attack. People are starting to notice that things between you and your brother have gone awry. Reporters: Prince William. Have you met your nephew yet? Have you seen Archie? Well uh, we look forward to seeing them when things have, um, quieted down. If you go and visit the new baby, the public will be reassured. I can't believe they named him Archie. It's not a royal name. I just don't know what to say to him anymore. Your future subjects see themselves as an extension of your family. If you can't smooth things over with Harry soon, rumors of your feud will only increase and the nation will feel unstable. As future king, I cannot allow this. Fine. But I'm not bringing Prince George and the children. Very well. Just you and the Duchess of Cambridge. I'll inform the press. Sir. It's either go and pay respects to your brother's brood or banish them to Australia. If wishes were horses, beggars would ride. Meggie Megawatt was such a star on that Aus tour. She might actually like to go and live on the other side of the world now. Enough. There's enough enmity going around already, Victoria. Please don't fuel it. Sir. My goodness. He's darling. What a jolly little fellow. He's so lovely, Meghan. Thank you both for the gifts and for coming all this way. Of course, it's no bother. We were planning a Windsor visit anyway. Where are the kids? Didn't they want to meet their new cousin? - They've all got a cold. - Tennis lessons. Meg, I would love to see the nursery. Sure. Fresh air? Getting much sleep? No. I can't believe you're keeping the kids away from us. I told you, tennis lessons. The future king must have a good backhand. Nice one. Advantage. Look... I know we've been having some healthy disagreements, but we've got to at least come together to address racism in the press. It's out of control. Three times I've publicly asked the British press to back off. Once as a boyfriend, once as a husband, now as a father, to no avail. Seventy-two members of parliament signed a letter saying Meg faced unfair attacks with outdated colonial undertones. You need to bloody well make a statement with me decrying racism. Publicly. As future king, push back on this horrific bullying. Bullying. Such a powerful word. They are painting me as a villain in the press, and no one in the palace seems to want to come out and stop that. Why not let me come out and defend myself? I understand your frustration. There are lies and rumors about me too. But you know, this is the life we signed up for. I mean, if I took the time to refute every little... I feel silenced. I know. As an American, you value freedom and individualism above all else. And well, here we value dignity above all else. But isn't it dignified for me to defend myself? Well... Harry: Think about someone outside yourself for once. This is bullying and you know it. They have so much to work out. They have centuries on their shoulders. Don't we all? Oh my god, for the last time, I agree that diversity in the family is a good thing. Because it makes you look good. But behind closed doors I have to listen to concerns about how dark our babies might be? They weren't expressing concerns, they were just curious. Open your eyes. Dad's even saying when he's king, he'll decree that only your kids will have the titles of prince or princess. I thought you didn't want your children raised that way. If my kids have the titles of prince or princess, they get a much higher level of police protection. That is what I care about. The racist death threats are too much. What causes problems isn't color. It's culture. Meghan's American. She acts more like a celebrity than a royal, and she doesn't seem to appreciate the difference. What she doesn't appreciate is how the firm is perfectly happy to lie to protect other members of our family, but everyone is suddenly silent when the press attacks her. I can't have this conversation any more. No, no, no. Someone on your staff hates Meghan for no good reason. H has been having a lot of nightmares recently. He won't say what about. Well, isn't he feeling a bit better being out at Kensington Palace? It's so lovely being out in the countryside. I really want to make this work Catherine, but you know how they say, fish out of water. Flapping and gasping here. You know, Trooping the Color is coming up. Well we could um, we could ride to the Trooping Parade together. In an open-top carriage so everyone can see. That would be wonderful. Yes, and if I wore the hat I wore to your wedding, Wills, he won't notice but some clever journalists will realize it's a sign of fondness. I never knew how eloquent a hat could be. Oh, we should coordinate color palettes as well. Whatever I wear, the press will tear me apart for this baby weight. Reporter: It's a tradition that goes back to 1748. On this highly patriotic day, a crucial ceremonial event in British royal tradition Everything is meticulously planned and designed to show the strength of Her Majesty's military power. Soldier: March! Reporter: Today, all eyes are on Meghan, the Duchess of Sussex, as this is her first official royal outing in months. In fact, some have accused her of using her pregnancy and maternity leave to hide from negative press. But today is a day where no one can hide. Are you all right? Woman: Well look who's arrived? Is that the woman who wore the racist brooch to Christmas brunch? I'll see you later. Father. What? She'll be on the balcony today? Yes, well yes. Of course felt the brooch, a terrible faux pas... but what can I do? She's a cousin. And Mother goes big on forgiveness, I'm sorry. I will try forgiveness too. Thank you, my dear. Ah, of course. Andrew. What's he up to now, eh? All we have to do is go out on the balcony, wave for 10 minutes, then go home, throw on some jeans and snuggle Archie. I know. I get it. But I wish my boobs would stop leaking. Did you bring the hand pump thing? Yes. I'll go find a ladies room. Vickie, my dear. Looking very stylish today. Oh. You know I've always had a soft spot for trooping. It's so patriotic. Yes, indeed. Marvelous opportunity to display harmony betwixt our two houses. You sure you won't have William stand beside Harry? Hmm, yes. Quite sure. Victoria, you know as well as I that the whole of Britain will be well aware that their princes are at war if they stand on opposing sides of the balcony. Precisely. We played very nice for the pretty wedding, waved a flag, and now it is time for William to show that he, as the future king, is not chumming with Me-ghan, and Hazza the Duke of Hazards. Good gracious. You know, I wish I'd been taping that for the Daily Mail article I'm poised to leak. Oh, they wouldn't publish it, darling. You know they only want snippets from moi. Speaking of, Meg's had a rather wobbly bottom lip lately. And that skin of hers. Oh, it is so thin. You know when she first arrived, we called her Tungsten, as strong as steel. But now I am not so sure. Hmm. Perhaps those rumors of postpartum depression are true. Oh dear. You know, I wasn't aware the level of the bar could be set quite so low. Hmm. Oh, Meghan darling. So good to see you. All things considered, you look radiant. Lovely to see you too, Lady Twysden-Smythe. Lady Hunt. I didn't stop thinking about you for a minute. When the press published that letter you wrote to your father Good lord. I thought my family dramas were scandalous. Is it true that they had an attractive blonde journo drive to Mexico to flirt it out of him? I'd be utterly mortified if I'd written something so personal and it became public. You poor dear. Oh, Your Highness. You look tired. Life of a new father. Life of a weak husband more like. Excuse me? Our country's dealt with this scenario before you know. With Diana and your father. A weak-minded prince gets outflanked by an attention seeking woman who disrespects centuries of tradition and jeopardizes the entire monarchy. Those who do not learn from history are doomed to repeat it. Your Highness. Markle, debacle. God. What's wrong? Everything okay? I just need you to follow protocol 100 percent today. Okay. Does that really need to be said? Well the last time... You mean the time I opened my own car door? Or the time I didn't want to wear old white lady pantyhose? Just please remember the order of precedence. I promise I won't ever stand in front of your grandmother, your father, his wife, your brother or Queen Catherine of England in Waiting. And always keep in mind the press uses zoom lenses and lip readers to scrutinize every single move... I'm not an idiot. But if I seem too stiff and serious they'll say I'm unhappy or being a new mother is too much for me, or there's trouble in paradise. So I'd better smile and smile and smile. Yes. Please. Just be a royal robot today. What about for the rest of my life? Reporter: So the Queen has returned home. Back at Buckingham Palace, enjoying the proceedings already watched by many on the balcony. And it's a good moment. Not now. Turn around! Turn around now! Harry: Darling. Darling. Darling. I said you look gorgeous. Are you ready to go? Are you all right? I don't think so. I don't think I am. You don't have to come to the Royal Albert Hall tonight. I do. I do. No sweetheart, you don't. You need a break. You don't understand. If I'm left alone right now I don't know what I might do. I'm so sorry I snapped at you on the balcony today. I know that everything you do is to protect me. I almost turned my back on the Queen. You were turning around to talk to your husband. I can just see the headlines now. Brown American divorcee disses Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth as the national anthem plays. At least you knew the words this time. I can't lose you. I can't lose you. Can we make a vow? Never to let the outside world spoil this. I'd love to promise that, but the British press will never stop coming for you. For Arch. And sometimes I feel so powerless. You can't control everything, Harry. That's what the nightmares are about. I see you literally being hounded to death. And I'm helpless to stop it. I can't bear to think my son will grow up stalked by paparazzi, and I don't want this little boy seeing his mother crying every single day. Well, unlike your mom, I am not alone in this. Your mom was barely even 20 when she was pregnant with William. I'm almost 40. I know myself and I have tools now to help me manage it all. Right? Right. Want to see what I'm working on with Vogue? A mirror. Yes. I'm putting a mirror on the front cover, see? So the reader gets to see themselves amongst these powerhouse women. And also be on the cover of Vogue, right? All these women are going to bend the arc of history. Just like you. Flower? Hey Mom. I know what you're doing. What? Okay. Let's go out for lunch or a coffee. Just give you a break. You're burying yourself in work. That'd be great, but they took my wallet and my keys, and I don't even have my passport. How am I supposed to pop out somewhere? You can ask them to send a car. "Them" say I shouldn't be out in public because I am overexposed. If I go somewhere, it's a national event. All eyes on me. Which is apparently the only thing I care about. It's been weeks. You haven't been anywhere. Yeah. People still find ways to make news out of me even when I don't go anywhere. Stay the f?á? Out of my trailer or I'll cut you, Kate! Wow! How imaginative. I'm an angry black woman. We need to redouble our efforts to combat small-minded inaccurate portrayals such as this. However, adding fuel to the fire, details have been leaked about you editing British Vogue. How was there a leak? The editor hasn't even told his own staff. I don't know where the leaks come from, but the press are turning out opinion pieces spinning this move as typically showy-offy. But I purposefully decided not to be on the cover. Doesn't that make me the opposite of a show-off? In addition, unfortunately details have also been leaked about the cost of Frogmore's renovation. Three million. Will and Kate's Kensington Palace apartments cost five million pounds of taxpayer money to renovate. Indeed. But William... Will be king. So he's the king of the castle, and I'm the dirty rascal. Well, I wouldn't say that the dirty rascal is an unimportant player, sir. In fact, this archetype is crucial to the royal story. When you were boys, William was, was no saint, and yet what did we hear about? Harry's drug shame. William was never mentioned. When the Rota found out, they protected Wills and praised Dad as a concerned father. Indeed. The real job of the Royal Rota, the press board that covers the monarchy, is to create a narrative which protects royals in strict order of succession. We must find a way around this. Social media would mean we avoid the Rota entirely. We cannot just get rid of the Royal Rota just by wishing it so. The old boys' network is extremely powerful. Maybe I need to strengthen the new girls' network. Hello? Is everything all right? Of course, everything is fine. I was just calling to say hi. That's very nice. Happy birthday to you by the way. Thank you so much, and thank you for posting the lovely picture of us on your social media. Meghan: I'm sad we don't have anything more recent looking happy as a family. Oh I know, I guess it's just difficult these days with the children and everything. Not to mention these leaks that keep coming. Goodness, I know. How unfortunate. The Royal Rota do seem to have a lot of very specific information, right? Meghan: Where do they get their intel? Do you know? I'm um, I'm not entirely sure I know what you're trying to say. Um, nothing. I just... someone clearly has an axe to grind and I'm not sure why. Is it because I use too many emojis when I text? I've heard that ruffled some feathers. Well that was considered a cultural faux pas, but not insurmountable. However, you do outright declare your intention to force change, and you do so in bright yellow neon. Kate: You're a highly intelligent woman Meg. How could you not see that this Vogue cover was very provocative? I mean, there's even a poem in there with the F word. It's hardly a smiley-faced emoji. Uh, I was... And it is full of political dog whistles, op-eds. You know that royals are to remain neutral on politics. Don't rock the boat, keep things calm and steady. It is literally our job. And, you know, it's not like Wills and I don't want changes. Of course we do. But it has taken us a decade to build up the goodwill and the, the proper channels to make those changes. You've hardly been here a year. There's a part of me that is in awe of you for wanting to take on the palace, but then the other part just shudders because the palace always wins, Meg. I promise you. The palace always wins. Uppity, Anti-White, Divisive. Absolutely idiotic. Meghan's Vogue shows her to be a hypocrite. This is the opposite of what I was trying to do. You've worked on this project for months now, so any criticism is going to be hard to take. I thought the goodness would shine through. They're saying I should've put more white women on the cover. Apparently I should've also put more men on the cover as well, if I wanted to be "fair to everybody." This problem is thousands of years in the making and you want it to change overnight. Just breathe. You're right, mama. Of course. It's always cold here. Not just the place, the people. Feeling sorry for yourself won't help, Flower. But I miss my friends. I miss the California sunshine, and I miss my mom. I'm so alone and I miss being myself. I don't belong anywhere anymore. You belong wherever that baby and your husband are. They love you. Thanks Mom. I gotta go. Talk to you later. Bye. Oh Archie. Did I ever tell you what your name means? Brave, genuine, and bold. And yes you will be. You are. I love you. I love you too. The Africa tour will be good for us. Can't come soon enough. Africa is where I fell truly in love with you. Let's do it all over again. Shall we move here? The firm would be happy to have us out of England. Did you know that being your husband... And my hero? Makes me truly happy? This is all going extremely well you know. The public are absolutely delirious with joy at Archie's first official public engagement. Arch meet Archie. Perfect. Great work Archie. Yeah. Um, unfortunately there are however still rumblings about this historic event being held on foreign soil with a non-Brit. They mean non-white. Well I suggest we dismiss this with the disdain it deserves. All right. Very busy week ahead, so I want to see you all getting some rest, yes? "These photos are for you and your brother, love and joy from Archbishop Tutu." He wants you to work things out. Working things out with Will right now feels more impossible than ever. I know Mum would hate to see us fighting, but... she'd understand where you and I are coming from more than anyone else in the world. Reporter: Today during his African tour, Prince Harry walked in his late mother's footsteps, commemorating Princess Diana's historic visit in 1997 which launched her campaign to rid the community of landmines 22 years ago. Ma'am, why do you have to be so political? What do you hope to achieve with this stunt? You know, I'm just trying to do good in the world. What is wrong with that? It's been an honor to retrace my mother's steps today. I lost her 22 years ago, but her memory is with me daily and her legacy lives on. Thank you. Harry, how is your relationship with William these days? Have you spoken with him since you've been in Africa? I said no more questions. Do you have any plans to move away from the UK? Perhaps to Africa as has been rumored, banishing the Sussexes. I said no more. Reporter: Are you or are you not going to stay in London? Is the Queen banishing you? Go. Harry: Faster. Faster! Here, we give self-defense classes and female empowerment training to young women because we are in an area that has the highest murder rate in South Africa. Thank you. Thank you. The rights of women and girls is something very close to my heart. I know that when women are empowered, the entire community flourishes. And on one personal note, may I just say that while I am here with my husband as a member of the royal family, I want you to know that for me, I am here as a mother, as a wife, as a woman, as a woman of color, and as your sister. I am here with you and I am here for you. You're a superstar. There's no one else who can turn a tree stump into the most powerful podium in the world. I didn't feel like a superstar. I felt afraid. Today was the first time that I said I'm a woman of color out loud and in public since we got married. And I was scared. I shouldn't be scared, I shouldn't have to hesitate to say that I'm a woman of color. I couldn't even speak my truth without all these caveats. Speaking on one purely personal note, not as a royal. I've been circling this idea for weeks. But I didn't know if I could actually say it. We have to leave the firm. What? No. We have to make this work. We've tried to make it work. Haven't we tried? No. I can't ask you to leave your family behind. I wouldn't be leaving behind my family. I'd be leaving the firm. But the monarchy is a family. So is the mafia. I'll always be my brother's brother. I'll always be my father's son. But I never asked for the job of being a royal, and this isn't who I am. It's like this toxic cycle. The same story of my family being told again and again. I need to break the cycle, and we've got to start telling our own story. How do we do it? They're suing the press? Wait, what, what, what don't they understand about the way the Rota works with the firm and for the monarchy? I will do my best to make it clear to our friends in the Royal Rota that the Sussex House are not acting on behalf of the palace as a whole. What does the statement from Harry say? As a couple, we believe in media freedom and objective, truthful reporting. We regard it as a cornerstone of democracy. We have never needed responsible media more. Unfortunately, my wife has become one of the latest victims of a British tabloid press. Victim, victim, victim, poor little me. It's, it's, it's like he's back in the army and she's Major Meghan. What are, what are they going to do next? Harry: Tom's not in the royal pocket. He gets it and he's a real gentlemen. We're going to be honest, we're going to speak for ourselves, directly. Perhaps you can just give us an idea of what the last year's been like? It's, um, hard. I never thought this would be easy, but I thought it would be fair. A lot of talk in the press about rifts with your brother. How much of that is true? Part of this family being under the pressure that it's under, stuff happens. But we're brothers and we'll always be brothers. We certainly are on different paths at the moment. Not many people have asked if I'm okay. But it's uh, a very real thing to be going through behind the scenes. What we need to do now is focus on being real, and focus on being the people that we are, and standing up for what we believe in. I will not be bullied into, into playing a game that killed my mum. The emotion. It... it feels very real to me. Of course it's real. That's what makes it so bloody powerful. It's just like your mother's interview for the BBC. She was manipulated into giving that interview. But still, I, I can't believe she said all that. Goes and tells the world about Camilla, the infighting with Dad. Even her affair with Hewitt. I bloody trusted that man. She had him take us riding, showed us around the guard stables, and all the while he and my mother were... Yeah. And how did I find out about it? By watching it all on telly along with the rest of the world. I was 13. I know. Do you know I think my heart first went out to you right then and there? Long before we'd ever met. Must've been so painful, my darling. My housemaster at Eton. He set up his own study as a private place for me to watch it all on telly. I cried my bloody eyes out. I know. I know you did. Did you see "it?" Yes. My mother did revealing interviews like this when she was preparing to leave the firm. Well, a separation would be best for everyone. But it must be done right, on palace terms. They can't be allowed to bugger off with all of the glory and none of the burden. While I'm left holding the bag. No, not on my watch, sir. Well, I have just been told that the Sussex clan is taking a hiatus. Six weeks. They claim they need some time off. Let me guess. In Barbados. Canada. Well it's, it's Commonwealth at least. And I'm told they're starting a new personal website run for them privately. They're calling it Sussex Royal. Sounds like a hotel. But it will be made entirely outside palace purview. They will control the brand. This is precisely why I suggested that only your children be given the titles of prince and princess when I am king. But you're not king. So what do you suggest I do in the meantime? We shall use what I believe is called "cancel culture." We can't exactly cancel the most woke bloke and his feminist bride. Well, the firm can cancel their royalness and prevent them from stealing the brand. Your Highnesses. With permission, I'd like to ask the firm to eliminate all mention of Harry and Meghan from the Royal Foundation website. This would send a clear message to them and to the world, literally and figuratively that the firm has cut them out. And excuse me for being blunt, but that should include the royal purse. Oh. They have to know what is at stake, William. They can't have it both ways. You leave the firm, you leave the family. My father is acting even more aloof than usual. Did you explain that we just need some time off? Of course. I said we need a bit of a breather, time to take stock. I also said we want to stop taking taxpayer's money and pay our own way so the press stops feeling like we owe a pound of flesh or 10. What did he say to that? That we shouldn't expect to have our extravagant lifestyle paid for. When I explained our plans to generate income, he just clammed up. Said he didn't want to talk about it. I can't imagine a British male saying that. Afternoon, Leonard. What's going on in the palace? We feel so far away. Well, um, the Sussex royal website maneuvering pushed the firm over the edge. They felt that you were going to capitalize on the brand without fully paying the price. And the price is silence. Leonard. Is there anyone you can talk to inside the machine? Ask for a little compassion. No! Look, Vicky. We have both known each other for years, and we are both aware that this is a highly tricky balancing act. But please, Harry and Meghan are not some symbolic boogeymen for you to demonize. They're human beings, with a new baby, I might add. They just need to step back for a while, that is all. While promoting the hell out of Sussex Royal and selling god knows what. Look, Harry wouldn't be doing anything unusual by selling things under the royal brand. Have you visited Buckingham Palace gift shop recently? Prince Charles sells organic soup, the Queen sells gin, her grandson Peter sells milk on Chinese telly. Yes, he's been scolded for being tasteless. He won't do it again. Look, the point is, Victoria, that no one owns the world "royal". Have you seen the port-a-potty brand, Royal Flush? Why can't Prince Harry use the term Sussex Royals to, to, to, to spread goodwill and basic human decency? Because unlike a lav, Harry is actually royal. And he needs to bloody well start behaving like it. Let's discuss what's really going on here. If this is some sort of popularity contest we shall win it. The Sussexes are the most celebrated royal figures since Diana. Check your metrics, Lenny. The Cambridges are always ahead on Insta. Only by a sliver. And all thanks to the bots you hired. I don't even understand what bots are. Well clearly you do. But here's what I don't understand. Why are you fighting us so hard? I mean your team should surely be delighted to get rid of the rainbow chasing divas for a while. You have a fundamental misunderstanding of our position. We wanted the Sussexes to play their roles appropriately, not abandon them completely. They are simply asking for some time off. Being royal is not a part-time job in a coffee shop. It is a lifetime commitment. Duty and dignity above all else. Prince Andrew did what? Randy Andy. Sorry, what was that you were saying about duty and dignity? They say Andrew did what? With teenaged girls. Certainly one in particular, allegedly. This caused a major backlash in the press and the public. There's a spare who really did live up to the dirty rascal racket. I hear the FBI wants to talk with him. Ugh, now we really need to step back. As soon as possible. Uh yes, except that the palace has asked that he step back from his royal duties. Okay, so? Well they are extremely concerned that Andrew's scandal will appear to be the reason you're wanting to leave the firm. It doesn't make us want to stay. Thus, they are directly asking that you do. We have to stay in the firm because my uncle's a disgrace to it? Indeed. The palace says quite adamantly that you are to put on hold all your plans to step back until further notice. No. As soon as 2020 rolls around, we're leaving the palace. Permanently. Tell them. That's only a month away. Sir. If I may, this is to our advantage. How? A Sussex exit makes them a perfect, outrageously disrespectful distraction from... other stories. First Meghan disrespects the Queen by refusing her invitation to spend Christmas with the family. It's outrageous. And now, now she's depriving the monarch of a chance to spend time with that adorable Baby Archie. Now isn't that, it's disgraceful. Then we feed positive stories to The Rota about your brood and some perfect Christmassy photos. Well they always release photos of the children at Christmas, so. Yes but, but this year it will be different and extremely special. Have you told Prince George that he will one day be king? No, not yet. It doesn't make for the easiest of school years I can tell you. You can't delay it forever. Announce that George has been told of his grand destiny, and then release official royal lineage photos. A new photograph of the Queen and her three heirs in the Buckingham Palace throne room. Let it be known who the real royals are, hmm? Ooh Merry Christmas baby Ooh Merry Christmas baby Happy, merry, jolly! I think we got it. No filter needed. Oh, amazing. Now that's a family Christmas photo. H, come look. H? The heart of the Christmas story lies with the birth of a child. Hey babe. Everything okay? The Queen's annual Christmas speech. She doesn't even mention us. There's no photo of us on her desk. No Archie. It's unprecedented. Everything in that frame is intentional. The palace is sending a message. They're making out that we're not part of this family. I told them I wanted out of the firm. The machine. Not to be pushed out in the cold and lose my grandmother. I've got to set up a meeting with her in person as soon as possible. I guess we're going back to England. Oh, welcome home Your Highness. Your Highness. We've done an extra special deep clean. Rumors of an impending pandemic. Can you believe it? That's why we didn't bring Archie. What's the status of the meeting between me and Gran? We want to be in and out of here so we can get back to him as quickly as possible. The uh, the Queen's people have postponed your meeting again, Your Highness. What? The palace has said that the Queen will be available to see you in 23 days' time. Oh. That's a very long time. Yes, well... We British tend to be rather good at pretending something isn't happening for so long it'll simply just go away. It occasionally works. This is not going away. One moment. Ah! What? What is it? What happened? Your written plan that the firm insisted that you put together to exit, the details have just been leaked to the tabloids. God damn it. How much do they know? Enough to keep them way ahead of us. We're not going to let them. Before the story can gain momentum, we'll put out a statement. The Sussex Royal site. We can launch right now and post our statement in full. With respect, the Queen has not yet signed off on this. They can't say we didn't try. They forced our hand. I'll talk to my father. Leonard, can you get him on the phone? Yes, sir. We've got to get a post up on Insta as soon as possible. Leonard: Harry for Charles. Here we go. This is for the best. Well I do hope so, sir. Because I can guarantee you after this, your world will never be the same again. Pa. I just thought you should know we're going public with our plans. We've got to get ahead of the press. Have you gone mad? When? In about 10 minutes. You can't be serious. A 10-minute warning? Pa, I've been trying to tell you for months and you've done nothing but stall. Now the press has it from someone leaky. Lord knows what they'll do with it. And if I'm really being honest, I've been trying to tell you I wanted to leave the firm my whole life. But you weren't listening. The same way you didn't listen to Mum. Harry, how dare you? You know? You know Meghan had her own moment when she was pregnant with Archie? That's what the firm does to people. Oh Harry, stop this right now! I am. I'm stopping them from destroying us like they have so many others. So yeah. You get a 10-minute warning. No turning back now. Tonight, royal exit. Seismic change inside that palace. - A new role for themselves. - Le shock. They say they intend to step back. To step back. A Megxit. They want to live life by their own rules. That's pretty dramatic stuff, isn't it? I mean, it's a bit of a wow. They actually did it. Hmm. My birdies at the tabs. Hello? I know. We're in shock. No, we had no idea they were planning to leave. Prince Charles was only given 10-minutes warning. Harry's impetuousness always gets the better of him. There shall be consequences, I assure you. Disrespecting the Queen. No, that's correct. Her Majesty the Queen had no idea. No, it's disgraceful. Absolutely disgraceful. No, we're astounded at how spoiled and ungrateful they are after everything that the palace did to welcome them. Yes, Her Majesty will be releasing a statement any moment now. And we've just now gotten word moments ago that the palace has released a statement indicating that they were completely unaware that this was coming. Shockingly, even the Queen herself was left in the dark. We've been trying to see her for weeks. I was blocked. It's not just the tabloids. Major pieces in The New York Times, Times of London, none of it good. Everyone's going crazy on social media, calling you a couple of selfish, spoiled brats. #Megxit. I'm the dirty rascal now. Megxit. Like it's all your doing. Like you're the wicked witch stealing the beloved prince because he has no mind of his own. You know what they used to call me when we got engaged? The hostage. Thanks for telling me. Ah. Please tell me you've got good news, Leonard. The Queen has called a royal summit, to be held on Monday, January the 13th to address the crisis. Well... At least we get our in-person meeting. Victoria: The Sandringham Summit, the press is calling it. Her Majesty has requested a family lunch beforehand. Just family. You and your brother, with their Gran. No. Tell her no. And let the Royal Rota know I refused. Let everyone understand it. My brother has not been loyal. Very good, Your Highness. And make sure Meghan isn't there for these negotiations. No one in that room needs her advocacy. Do you think she realizes she only played a lawyer on the goggle-box, hmm? I have spent my entire life building the trust of the people of this nation and the Commonwealth. Assuring them that this monarchy was something they could look to for stability and neutrality and unity in times of, well, uncertainty. And you Harry, well, you have fueled uncertainty. Yet another crisis that we have to weather. I'm here to make amends and do whatever you feel is necessary to move forward, Your Majesty. Hmph. One thing, if I may? It's extremely important that everyone here knows that the desire to step back is mine. This is not what Meghan wanted. All she wanted, desperately, was to be a part of this family and a representative of Your Grace. Hmm. I believe you. Oh, you brothers. I had hoped that you would remain close. But the old pattern is powerful. It was thus with my father and his brother. It was thus for me and my sister. And then Andrew, well. So William. I ask you, what is your role in all of this? Your Majesty. I did not contribute to my brother's careless actions. But did you make every effort to welcome your brother's bride into the family and the firm? We did our best under difficult circumstances. And why, pray tell, did you reject my invitation to a family luncheon before today's summit, hmm? Well, I wanted to stick to business. The monarchy is at stake. Oh you make my very point, dear. The monarchy is at stake. And a real opportunity has been lost here. A brilliant job you've done of managing it. Mother... Well... It's quite clear we will not have a business agreement here today. I shall seek to make sure that the press and the people understand that we are more than a business. We are a family. Family business negotiations will follow, and we will find a solution in a matter of days, not weeks. The country deserves a swift solution and quite frankly, so do I. I hope you will forgive me if I use this opportunity to share with you my plans for the future which now indeed have changed. Once Meghan and I were married, we were excited. We were hopeful. We were here to serve. For those reasons, it brings me great sadness that it has come to this. Over the next few months, I will be seeking a more suitable way of combining a meaningful public role with hopefully a more private life. We are taking a leap of faith. I hope you can give me the time and space that has been lacking in recent years. Thank you for giving me the courage to take this next step. What are you going to wear to Commonwealth service? I haven't decided yet. Why? Just want to make sure this time you're not going to secretly consult with Meghan or wear something from their wedding to show as a secret signal of support. I didn't know you were such an avid fashionista, dear. Find out what color she'll be wearing and wear the opposite. All right. I understand. The Commonwealth service is their last event as royals and you want to... I don't want a rival monarchy being set up in North America! They're not royals. All right. All right, I understand. If the institution crumbles when Gran dies, Meghan can go off and earn a new fortune as a TV star or something. And I'll just be the guy under whom the centuries old institution failed. That will be my legacy. Well, I'd like to think you'll have something of importance left. Sorry. Sorry, of course. I love you. You're in an impossible situation. An incredibly privileged situation, and I'm proud to live up to it. It isn't easy. No. Moving forwards, you and I can start to show a bit more PDA. Oh. People like that thing that Meg did, rubbing a hand on Harry's back. Oh? Like this? And hug the people? Oh. All right. Yes, you can. And give some interviews. Maybe we could start a YouTube channel. People want to feel close to us, the way they felt to my mother. I want to protect her legacy. Make it part of ours. Her Majesty as head of the Commonwealth, will lead a multi-faith religious service across five continents today. Delivering a common future is today's theme. In her Commonwealth speech released by the palace yesterday, the Queen said she hopes the people of the Commonwealth will be inspired by all that we share and move forward with fresh resolve. Her Majesty said she felt it inspiring to be reminded of the diversity of the people and countries that make up our worldwide family. Of course everyone in the nation, indeed the whole world, will be watching today as the two brothers Prince William and Harry will be together in public for the last time before the Sussexes are officially relieved of their royal duties. How do you feel? Sad. Proud. Confused. Excited for whatever comes next. And more in love with you than ever. And for my last day ever as a royal, something a little less fairytale, something a little more... Superhero? Hmm. A cape. A cape. And I had the tailor line your suit with the exact same shade of green. So when the wind blows up the corner of your jacket everyone will see we match. We're well-suited. What? Brits love a pun. Lucky for you I love Brits. Well, this one anyway. Come in. I like that one too. I beg your pardon, Your Highness? She's wondering if you would move to North America with us, Sir Briggs. Ah. No, going back to Downing Street for me, I think. Well, all I can say is thank you for everything, and goodbye. I'm sad you won't be part of our team any longer. You're the only one I never made cry, apparently. Ah. Well not even the death of Bambi's mother could manage that mar. Serving you has been the honor of a lifetime. I would hug you, but... Corona. A crown that nobody wants. Indeed. Final day, sir. Are you ready? I'm ready. I've been ready for quite some time. Very good. Well after the Commonwealth reception, a car will take you both to the service with Her Majesty to Westminster Abbey. Good luck. Soldier: Guards, present arms! Reporter: In their red tunics, fifty-three guardsmen stood to attention this morning, each carrying the flag of the countries which make up the Commonwealth as their leaders arrived for the opening ceremony. Ladies and Gentlemen. In seven minutes the cars will arrive to take you to Westminster Abbey. Once you receive your programs, please make your way towards the exit. Meghan: Keep up the good work and thank you for everything. It's been an honor. What's the matter? There's no mention of us in the procession. On our last day. Our very last event as royals. The palace, make that William, is shutting us out so we sit like regular audience members. Only he and Catherine walk the nave as part of the procession with the Queen. Oy. What the hell is this? It's what you asked for. Why are you so upset? Whatever happened to just Harry? Four minutes until the cars are here to take you to Westminster Abbey, Your Highnesses. How does it look to have the one person of color in our family removed from the procession when the majority of the Commonwealth countries are in Africa? Not to mention Barbados, Jamaica, Bahamas. What it looks like is that you stepped down from your duty while the rest of us lived up to it. You should've taken my advice in the first place. William. Just come out and tell me how you feel. Say it to my face if you need to say it. Say it. Out loud. You're a disruptor and that's why Harry wanted you in the first place. It's not just because I'm pretty? The reason Harry and I have been at such odds since you came into his life is because I could see quite clearly that you wanted, even needed, to challenge this system. I'm not saying I don't understand why. I do. But this is a system I was born to uphold and protect, and that's what I'll do. He was trying to protect us all. From one woman. One minute, Your Highnesses. You two have walked down the aisle of Westminster Abbey side by side many times. Of course. Now I know, I know that today, it will be hard. But... nothing could be harder than walking down the aisle of Westminster Abbey behind your mother that day. But you got through it. Together. What better way to, to honor her than to, to show her that although you do have your differences you're still united. Shoulder to shoulder. The programs are printed. Two thousand of them. You can change the rules. You're going to be king one day. You will not walk the royal procession. But we won't either. Catherine and I will skip the royal procession today, you sit in the row right behind us with Edward and Sophie. Fine. Congregation: We affirm that every person possesses unique worth and dignity. We affirm our respect for nature, and that we will be stewards of the earth by caring for every part of it, and for it as a whole. We affirm our belief in justice for everyone and peace among peoples and nations. Joining together in kinship and affinity, in diversity and unity, as members of a worldwide family of nations, we build on shared inheritances. Look at little Archie go. Meghan: H, come quick. Arch is dancing. The little one said, roll over, roll over There were nine in the bed and the little one said Roll over, roll over We'll dance later, baby. Grandma's going to read Duck Rabbit. Canadian officials have just told me they will commit no further resources for our protection. And my father has withdrawn his financial support completely. But you and Arch were born with targets on your back. You don't get a choice in all this? They think I did have a choice about who to marry. Which I absolutely didn't. I just can't believe my father. He knows what it feels like to have the firm not approve the person you love. Harry: He's not returning my calls. They want me to know what it feels like to be out in the cold. They're exiling me. They're doing everything they can to preserve the monarchy. We have to do what we can to protect our family. We have to figure something out quickly. The pandemic is spreading so fast. They said international borders are about to close. We won't be able to leave. And thanks to The Daily Mail and that pap up a tree who shot you and Arch walking with the dogs, they know exactly where we are. I know you're worried, and I'm sorry your family is being so awful. I know a little bit about that myself. But we have each other. And I have a plan. California knows how to party California knows how to party In the city of LA They're poplocking, woo So rough, so tough out here baby So rough, so tough out here California knows how to party California knows how to party In the City of L.A I like American royalty. Self-made too. How long do you think Tyler will let us couch surf here? Till we find our own place. Oprah said we should look near her. Find ourselves a real home. I like the sound of that. You really think you can make California your home, babe? I know it's very different. Twist my arm. What do you reckon? Think we could be happy here? It's nice. It's big. Well, we're going to need some extra room. Are you... I'm pregnant. It was a great honor to be asked to give a commencement speech for my Alma Mater. But to be honest, I worried about how it would be picked apart and analyzed. Then I realized the only wrong thing to say is nothing. As I speak to you about my support for Black Lives Matter, I feel sure of this. You, the next generation, will lead with love. You will lead with compassion. You will use your voice in stronger ways than you've ever been able to before. Oh. Shall her relentless self-expressing never cease? First she had to talk about Black Lives Matter at a commencement speech, now this. It's a big excessive, no? "Let us commit to asking others, are you okay?" That's exactly what she said in that interview, wasn't it? "No one asks if I'm okay." "As much as we may disagree," "as physical distanced as we may be," "the truth is, we are more connected than ever." We are not connected anymore. Well thank heavens. "Losing a child means carrying an almost unbearable grief," "an unbearable grief experienced by many "but talked about by few. "Despite the staggering commonality of this pain, "the conversation remains taboo," "and riddled with unwarranted shame," "perpetuates a cycle of solitary mourning." Yes, Me-ghan rolls again, louder than ever. God she's such a show off. That is, it's one way to look at it. Why? Why does she have to go on flapping her feelings out like a bat every time she gets a bit wobbly? I mean, some of us prefer to keep such things private for, for good reason. It's a miscarriage. It's not like she's not going to have another baby. She's pregnant again I hear. Due in the summer. Excuse me, I'm terribly sorry. I just... Your Highness. Victoria: Oh, it's pathetic. Well. There goes a good soldier. Now then. What are we going to do about this bloody Oprah interview that she's planning, hmm? Hey Flower. Hi. What you doing? Oh, stuff. Right. Right. Stuff. Okay, come on. Stuff can wait. Let's do fun. Outdoors, get some air. Take the boys to the beach? Mm-hmm. I'll drive. They're trying to stop us from doing the Oprah interview. What? They're fighting back because they think the interview will be a nuclear option. Ah, let them fight. We need to let people hear our truth. I just hope the firm is finally listening. Well, whether or not they are, they can't retaliate. They've already taken everything they can actually take from us. They've cut us off completely. You know what that means? We're completely free. You broke the cycle. This belonged to my mum. Thought you might want to wear it. All right. If you could step on set, that would be great. Oprah will be here momentarily. Meghan, you'll go first, yes? I'm ready. Well, as they say, may the bridges we burn light the way ahead. Your mom would be so proud of you. I got no support. They just said "you're on your own." I had no idea what I was going into. I was thrown into the deep end, and nobody ever helped me at all. They'd be there to criticize, but never be there to say well done. I just didn't want to be alive. It was a very real and frightening constant thought. I threw myself down the stairs. I went to HR, but they, they wouldn't help me. They said it wouldn't look good for the monarchy. So I was a problem. She's different. She's doing everything we never did. Why? I was excluded totally. What would you say has been your greatest achievement? To not bow down to pressure. At the beginning I always had my head down. And now I'm ready to go forward. This is, in some ways, just the beginning for us. Would you leave the format of the monarchy as it is now, or would you alter it for your sons? I am altering it. I'm the last person to think woo-woo, you know? But it's undeniable what the overlap is. So yeah. There was a bigger purpose. There was other forces at play, I think. It's been unbelievably tough for both of us. But at least we had each other.
