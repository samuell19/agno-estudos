Now, the old man said you were to be here when he gets back. And that's what I'm here to see to. And that's the only game I'm playing. Dig? [Chuckling] Yeah, man, I dig. Hey, man, don't get uptight, man. I was just trying to be friendly, you know, Spread a little love around, get a few answers here. Can't blame a dude for that. Hey, Why don't we save the lip service until Nate gets here, Huh? Nate? Nate Williams? Big Nate Williams? Hey, man, I think it's... think it's about time for me to split. Hey! Whoa. You stay till Nate gets here. [Horn honks] Heh. Hey, boss. How was your trip? Fine, son. Is everything all right here? No problems, boss. The suspense is killing me. I can't wait to find out why you picked me up that night. Hey, ain't nobody ever cared for me before. [Sighs] You got a lot of guts, kid. It isn't every day someone tries to hold up Tony Burton's joint. That place is guarded like fort knox. Yeah, I found that out the hard way. Man... [Chortles] Nate Williams. Numbers king. Man, you are the last person I ever expected to help me. I'm the kind of man that recognize talent. And when I find it, I put it to work. You offering me a gig? I'm not offering. You got one. Your friend got killed, didn't he? Yeah, my friend Tommy. We didn't have no bread, But nothing else we could do. We grew up together too. He was my best friend. Man, right in front of my eyes. Still can't believe he's dead. All we was trying to do was survive. That's what we all trying to do. You lucky you got away with just a scratch, sucker. Ain't no use in you snibbling. You still alive, ain't you? If I was Nate, you would... Sonny. You talk about survival, kid. Let me tell you what it takes. When you've lived out there as long as I have, Then you can talk about survival. The more you know, the more you need to know. It doesn't get any easier the older you get either. What you got the other night was just the smoke. The fire is yet to come. I'm gonna do something that no one ever did for me. I'm gonna give you the benefit of my experience. If you use it well, We'll get along. If you don't, You'll have to answer to me. Do you understand, mister? Yes, sir. Here, j.J. Here's some bread. Get yourself together, Then I want to see you later, okay? Thanks. * make them pay * hey, j.J. * 'cause the man awaits * he's staying committed, so carry through * * stop the death flow * depends on you * all you got to do is * take out the man * stop the strife * maybe and your life * hey, j.J. * today's the day * hey, j.J. * it's freedom day * hey, j.J. * make them pay * hey, j.J. * ah * blow the man away * whoa * you stay committed * so carry it through * stop the death flow, depends on you * * all you got to do is * take out the man * stop the strife * maybe end your life * hey, j.J. * today's the day * hey, j.J. * yeah * yeah, yeah * freedom day * hey, j.J. * make them pay * hey, j.J. * throw the man away * blow the man away * blow the man away * blow the man away * hey * j.J.J.J.J.J. * yeah, throw the man away * hey * kill 'em * take him on one time * please * ooh, yeah, ooh, yeah * * take 'em on, yeah * make him pay * uh-huh * make him pay What's happening, blood? How you doing? Why you in the middle of the street, man? Got to be careful, baby. Hey, dig, man. I've been putting the squeeze on the dope, But the skag is still getting through. And I want to cut it off completely and quick. I want to put that lid on so tight, Even the rats can't come up for air. What kind of crusades are you on? Tony Burton. But why now, man? His kind's been around a long time. Ain't no room for the both of us, And like you, I want to control my own destiny. As long as Tony is here, There's always gonna be somebody telling us what to do. If we cut off the flow of the big h, Tony loses most of his control in his community. And are you gonna take up where Tony left off? Hey, man, you need money to run your organization, right? And the kind of money you need you can't get By selling a two-bit newspaper on the street corners Or passing around a tin cup at a rally. You need the kind of money my organization can give you. Hey, man, I've had offers before. I turned them down because I don't want nobody to control us. Now, the essence of our struggle is independence, And we don't like slave masters no matter what color they are. And some of your men are no good to you as they are. The less skag in the community, the better for you. Come on, man. Since when you are concerned about anybody besides j.J.? You pimp everything and everybody in the neighborhood. You trying to hustle me, too, j.J.? Because if you are, man, I'm not gonna stand for that shit. Look, man, I know you. I know how you make your money. You got women whoring for you. Your numbers rackets takes people eating money, man, Possessions stolen, trucks hijacked, Welfare checks copped. You name it, j.J., you got it. You're no goddamned different from Tony. Now, look, man. You're bleeding the goddamned community. As far as I'm concerned, You're just as corrupt as he is. Look, I'm not gonna justify corruption to you. It's always been here, and it always will be. What I'm rapping to you about is power, baby. I know what I am. And right or wrong, people look up to me Because they think I am a success. I've got what they've always wanted: Money. Without it, you're nothing. Money buys dignity. Poverty is a crime. Nobody ask you where you got your dollar. They ask you, do you have it? That idealistic shit don't pay your rent. I don't want to start philosophizing anyway. All I want is Tony out of here. Everything else is secondary. You're a cold motherfucker, j.J. Yeah, you tell me about it. Now, what I want... Wait, goddamn it. Wait, a goddamn minute, j.J! Before we go any farther, I want you to understand that any alliances between us Is subject to some conditions. Speaking of alliance, brother niah is with us. You dealing with dude and his men? You'll kill us, man. They take pride in wiping people out. That's how they make their living. Those cats don't play. This is a war. We've got to use every weapon at our disposal. Niah and his brothers are some of the baddest warriors around. They get the job done. Now, what are your conditions? Okay, I want all dope to be destroyed. I want my men to be protected And bailed out of jail if necessary. And I want you to pay all operational expenses On my headquarters, And no goddamn body but me gives orders to my men. Now, if you want to work with me under those conditions, Then I'm with you. All right. All right. As long as your men do the job that needs to be done, It's all right with me. They know the streets and the small-time pushers. We've got to keep them dry, And that's what your men can do. Now, I know who the big-time operators are, And I can keep the pressure on them. And between us, we ought to be able To let Tony feel the squeeze, and that's where it's at. Okay, brother, let's get it on. Power to the people. [Laughs] [Funky instrumental music playing] What do you say, cabbage? How's it going, lieutenant? Okay. I'll tell j.J. That you're here. Okay. J.J. The lieutenant is here to see you. Yeah. You can go up now. Nice. Very nice. It's real sharp. Not bad at all, considering. How long I know you, j.J.? Four years. You've done very well. You're a man of power. You know, Joe, If I had more than $4 in my pocket, You would say I've come a long way. What's that supposed to mean? Just what I said. Not as sharp as you used to be. I got a feeling you're trying to tell me something. Who is it you're working for? You take money from me, from Nate, from Tony. You take money from everybody. Now, don't you have no loyalties? Loyalties? [Laughs] I'm loyal to myself and whoever pays me. All right. Since I just paid you, There is something I want you to do for me. I want you to tell Tony to stay out of the black community. Things are gonna be a little different from now on. We're sick and tired of being exploited. And somebody has got to put a stop to it, And it looks like that somebody is going to be me. You tell Tony that for me. You tell him that I am prepared To fight with everything I've got. Not only him, But anybody who comes in here and tries to walk over us. His power ends where he sees the first black face. You're biting off an awful lot, j.J. You're sure that's the message you want me to give him? I'm positive. And being a cop, You should know that it isn't so easy For a white man to come in here and fuck over us Without getting his brains blown out. Yeah, that's true, but does Tony know that? That's why I want you to tell him To avoid bloodshed. Okay, if that's what you want. That's it. [Phone rings] See you, Joe. Take it easy. Oh, yeah, yeah, send him up. Okay. [Funky instrumental music] Cockroach. [Splashing] Honey, say hello to Joe. Hi, Joe. Why don't you take your clothes off and have a swim? Honey, why don't you go for a swim? Joe's not here for pleasure. That's right, honey bucket. [Sighs] Yeah, just came over to pick up my rent And give you a message from j.J. He said to stay the hell out of his neighborhood. He said to make sure that you understand That his neighborhood starts where the black faces start And end the same way. Just repeating what he said, Tony. So? He's prepared to fight. [Scoffs] He's prepared to fight with what? Don't underestimate him, Tony. Since he started to take over, He's organized everything into a smooth-running operation. He's got everything under his control Except for the dope. He's gambling for complete power, And he may be able to do it, 'Cause we can't go into the community the way we used to. The people will back him up against us. Even the police have to watch their step in there nowadays. I don't give a damn what he's gambling for. The territory is not mine to give. I was put here to run it, and that's what I'm gonna do. I've been threatened before. How does Nate stand on this? I like him, Tony, but he's getting a bit old. If we put pressure on him, will that stop j.J.? J.J.'S pretty strong-willed, But it may work. Well, we're gonna have to see that it works. Go ahead and tell Johnny to give you your money. Mm-hmm. Right. Got some nice entertainment here, j.J. The rumors were true. There is a beautiful lady in town. And looks like she's gonna stay for a while. Seem like the club is doing all right, j.J. It's beautiful. I really like it. I wish you a lot of success. I hope so. Sonny, will you stay with Yvonne till I get back? J.J. And I have got to go take care of some business. Dig you later, Sonny. I heard you've been putting a lot of pressure on Tony. Yeah. We got to run him out of the neighborhood. What you'll get is nothing but a whole lot of trouble. Tony will bring men in and he'll fight you. And there'll be a lot of bloodshed. Are you willing to take that on yourself? J.J., don't let your mouth overload your ass, now. Hey, Nate. For years, you stood by And let these people come in here And do whatever they like Without saying or doing anything about it. Now when I'm willing to take the risk, You're trying to stop me. If it's a fight Tony wants, he can have it. It's better than letting it drag on For another 30 years like you did. I don't have to listen to this. There isn't gonna be any fight 'Cause I don't want it. Nate, you don't have any choice. Now, you stood by And you let these people fill this community with dope From street to street until nobody is safe from it, Not even our kids. And people are killing each other to get bread to by junk To put in their arms! And who's responsible for this? Tony and his people. Some junkie almost killed me in an alley one night To get bread to by shit to put in his arms. The night you picked me up, My best friend died because he needed junk. You're no better than Tony. I'm not patting myself on the back About how great I am. I just want Tony out of here. And if it's gonna take that to split us up, Let it happen right here and right now! Hey. The entertainment is starting. Looks like I got here just in time. Come on, let's dig some music. [Indistinct singing] Yvonne, why don't you have a seat? I'll be right with you. I have to close up here with my bartender. Okay. I'm going home. I'm feeling a little tired. I'll meet you at the gym with Sonny. You're not sick or anything, are you? No, I'm just a little tired in every respect. Okay. Hey, cabbage, come over here. The next time you let anybody into my office Without warning me first, You're fired. I didn't know you'd mind Nate's daughter, j.J. Anybody. Sonny, let's go. [Car horns honking] What did you do last night, baby? Nothing. I went to bed very early. I had to work... I'm Tony Burton. Tell Nate I'm here. Do you have an appointment, sir? He'll see me. Well, just a moment. Let me see if he'll see you. Mr. Williams, there's a Mr. Burton here to see you. Yes, uh-huh. All right. Mr. Burton, if you'll have a seat for a few moments, Mr. Williams will see you as soon as he's free. [Sighs] [Buzzing] Yes, Mr. Williams. Yes, sir. Mr. Burton, you can go in now. Thank you. Stay here. Mr. Burton, to what do we owe the honor of this visit? Nate, our organizations have been getting along For a long time. But lately things haven't been working out so well, And that's not good business. I want things back on the old footing. You've been talking, And I haven't understood one word you've said. As far as I'm concerned, everything's the same. Not quite. My people are being harassed, we're losing our merchandise. Now, I don't say that you're directly responsible, But I understand j.J has some part in this. You tell him to lay off. Mr. Burton, things haven't really changed. Your kind is still coming into my office Telling me what to do. Now, I don't know what's going on out there, But I do know there's got to be a change. And maybe that's what j.J. Is out there trying to do. Speaking of changes, Mr. Burton, Chair. Nate, we have a vested interest in this community. Now, if you have any influence anymore, You see that we don't lose it. [Chortles] Vested interests. I know how much vested interest you've had over the years In this community. Remember? I've always been part of that interest. You tell that punk that I'm not gonna stand by And watch him destroy what I've built up. Now, I don't want any bloodshed. But if that's what he's after, I'll give it to him. Bloodshed? You mean you come into my office, Tell me you gonna shed my blood If I don't do what you want? You better be careful when you talk About shedding blood in this community. It might just spill over on you. If that's what you want... Good-bye, Mr. Burton. Hey, Sonny. You pack a good punch for your age. Be confident, guys. Pack a good punch for any age. And I can prove it. No, thanks. I don't fight except when I have to Or my survival's at stake. Then I never lose. Copping out, j.J.? Nigger, you get out of my face. You want to fight, go down and fight city hall. That's where your problem is. You wouldn't be here picking a fight with me. [Clanging] Listen, you jiving? I let niggers like you call me Uncle. Before the meat wagon comes and scrapes them up. Nigger! If you got any guts, you'll make a move So I can mop the floor with your ass. [Clanging] Next time you fuck with me, I'll kill you. You didn't hurt him, did you? Just ring the bell, that nigger will get up fighting. [Chuckles] That was a lucky punch, j.J. Sonny, get in the shower. I like the idea of Tony coming over With his hat in his hand to ask a favor of me. Nate Williams. Not to tell me, but to ask me. And things begin to come clear to me Why I picked you up that night. I felt you were different then. I knew the time would come when there had to be a change. And I think the time is now. I sensed your instinct for survival also, But you're going too far, j. This is my fight. You stay out of it. I can handle it. You take care of yourself and Yvonne. I've stayed alive for a long, long time, j. That's proof enough that I can take care of myself. [Laughs] I still think that was a lucky punch, j.J. Right. [Laughs] [Clattering percussion music] * Now, wait a minute, man. You take that shit, they'll kill me. I'm gonna let you go this time. Next time I won't be so easy on you. You tell whoever it is you're working for Not to send you back, 'cause if they do, Your ass won't be worth much. All right, move out. Take your friend. Don't spend time. [Car starts up] [Tires squeal] [Lock unlatching] [Laughing] [Moaning] Oh, j.J., it's beautiful. Yeah, I really enjoyed the evening. You sure know nice places to go, j.J. Whenever I have more than three drinks, I can never get these goddamn keys in that lock. I think you had more than three drinks. Everything was so delightful. Anything for a beautiful lady. [Laughter] No. Yeah. [Squealing] No. * all of my life * I've had bad luck * yes, it was all downstream * now you're in my life * it's gold times for us * are you real or just a dream? * * anything you desire * fighter fuel, swim for the fire * * take my soul * it's for hire * and I won't charge a dime * * there's no peace where I wander * * though I've roamed here and yonder * * loving you * I just ponder, ponder * come fill a hole in my soul * * when you're close * days are sunny * when you go, it ain't funny * * no, no, no, no * when your game kicks some money * * only stay in my life [Button clicks] [Bluesy guitar music] * Morning. Mm. I could get used to this. I dig your being here in the morning. It's no problem. Say the word, and I'll be here whenever you want. That was a fast one. You know, it really bugs me When you men don't expect a woman to speak her mind About what she wants. You expect women to be hiding in alleys And dodging around corners with their feelings. As soon as we're being straightforward, You get uptight. It's the same thing with my father. He can find 10 million reasons to convince me That I don't really know what I want. Now, could you tell me at one time or what age A woman is supposed to know what she wants, j.J.? No, I wasn't getting uptight. I was just trying to make conversation. Come on. Too early in the morning to be getting massacred. Get up here. [Laughs] I love you. But I can't make that commitment right now. So many things I got to do. Things I can't tell you about. Trust me. All right. If it has to be that way, I can accept it. Leastways I know you love me. Mm. You have something to look forward to. Now I know I'm not leaving this city, And don't you try and get rid of me, you hear? [Laughter] [Funky piano music] * [Tires squealing] [Tires squealing] We got a cockroach upstairs. Let's see what we got. [Ominous warped synth music] * Now, cockroach, let's run that shit down from the top again. I... T-told you everything I know already. I want to hear it again. I heard rumors that there's a shipment coming in. From what I understand, it's a... Big one. How do you know? The message came down to firm up our c-c-conections... And to make some new ones. That's why you were hanging around the high school, huh? No. I was just taking a walk. It was a beautiful day. I don't push that stuff to the k-k-kids. I-I don't play that game. Cockroach, you're lying. Now, you been crawling around this neighborhood for years. It's extermination time. No, please, mister. D-d-don't shoot me. I'll-I'll-I'll get out of the... The area. I-I-i-I'll leave the neighborhood. Now, that's one promise I'm gonna make sure you keep. Now, when is that shipment coming in? I d-don't know. May-maybe three weeks. I don't know exactly. Are you sure they said three weeks? Mister, honest, I don't know. If I hear anything, I'll c-c-call you And... and let you know. What make you think you're gonna live to call me? Especially if you don't tell me what I want to know. Now, when and how was that shipment coming in? Honest, mister, I t-told you everything I know. Even if you k-kill me, I couldn't tell you anymore. I don't know anymore. I know what I'd do with the motherfucker. Put a clamper over his face and turn him loose. Then for sure he won't be back. He wouldn't last ten seconds out there in that shit. That's exactly what I should do. [Gun clicks] Now, cockroach... Start running. Move! [Laughter] [Knocking on door] Yeah? Rem Stokes. You need fuel? Yeah, baby. Come on, open up, man. It's dry in there. Ah! [Whimpering] Toss it over here, man. Hey, I got to have some of that. One fix, please? You... you can't dump it before you give me a fix. I'll pay you. Anything. I-I've been uptight for three days. Please. [Sobbing] I'll fuck you for it. Yeah. Yeah, that's what I'll do. I'll fuck you for it right now. Close your eyes and you pretend it's me. You cold, filthy motherfucker! [Sobbing] [Grunts] [Sobbing] [Gasps] [Sobbing] Now, what did you say was happening at j.J.'S? I went over there to see him And I saw some militants coming out the back door, Only they weren't militants. They were j.J. And his men dressed To look like diablo's boys. I tailed them to guess where? Diablo's headquarters. I thought those two didn't get along. That's why the squeeze is on so tight. I didn't know he had it in him. I told you not to underestimate him, Tony. These militants don't care about the dope. They just dump it anyway. See, that's the only way j.J. Can keep the squeeze on All over the ghetto. Well, it's time to teach that spook the facts of life About my territory. Joe, you ar working exclusively for me now. Hey, Tony, I don't work for anybody. Don't you ever try to put me in between you and j.J. I don't want to be caught up in any shooting. When that time comes, I become a cop again. Hey, I got to breeze. You'll go when I tell you. What do you think we've been paying all that money for, Joe? We can't have the militants stockpiling guns. Something has to be done, And it's your duty to do it. When did you find that out, Tony? I didn't know they had any firearms. And even one unregistered gun's illegal, right? So when you make the raid on the headquarters, You'll have justifiable cause. I couldn't do that, ton'. I just couldn't. You'll do it, And I don't want one of those black bastards to escape. You'll do what I say, Joe, because if you don't, well... I'll let you know the time and the place for the raid. Well, you can go, Joe. Tony, new Orleans calling. It's all right to pick up the package. Good, good. Tell j.J that Mrs. Willie mae brown is here. Just a minute. I'll let him now. J.J. Ms. Willie mae brown is here. Okay. Will you take a seat over there? J.J will be right with you. All righty. J.J. How you are, Mrs. brown? So good to see you? Good seeing you. How is your husband, Mrs. brown? Is he feeling any better yet? I'd say he's about the same. His mind is all right, But his body just ain't so good anymore. Well, if you need some money, I can give you some. Thank you, hon. But that's not all I came for. You know that I work for judge kindle, now, don't you? Yeah. Well, when I was at work, Making the beds, I heard the judges' son and his girlfriend talking Out by the pool. He was talking about a big deal That's worth $3 1/2 million. And he was gonna use the judge's plane To fly it in. And then she said, "what... "What makes you think that you're so indes"... Indes... ind... You mean indispensable. Right. That's the word. Indispensable. What did he say then? Well, he "said, who else can move" "$3 1/2 million worth of dope Without somebody suspecting him?" He's a shrewd mother... [Chuckles] You know, Nate has always told us To keep our ears open. You did right by coming to me, Mrs. brown. I'll make sure that Nate hears about it too. Oh, thank you, j.J. You don't know how much this is appreciated. And... If I hear anything more, I'll let you know. Hello, Tony. See it on the 6:00 news. No, I'm not going along. They should be leaving the station about now. Right, ton'. Okay, bro, me and you. Men, you've been doing a beautiful job Protecting your brothers in the street. But we've got to continue to keep the squeeze on And break the man's back. [Chortles] Right on, brother. We can dig it. Now, we understand that Tony is expecting a large shipment. Our job is to find out when, where, And rip it off before it gets into the pusher's hands. So brothers, I want you to keep the grapevine open, Keep the squeeze on, And don't overlook anything. I dig. I mean, we put an awful lot of money down in the sewers Since we started. And we're talking about a lot of money On this one haul. Brother, we don't care how much money is involved. We're still gonna dump that shit in the river. I mean, hey, man, These guys are hooking 13-and-14-year-old Young brothers and sisters, And I don't want my sister to be no junkie at 13 years old. And if there's anybody in here that does not have That same goal in mind, You gonna have to answer to me. I didn't say I was gonna cop the dope and sell it. Hey, brothers, Let's not get carried away here. Now, we'll answer that problem when we get to it. Like I said, we've been doing a fine job. And we want to continue. Now, I think we should go back And find out what we can. Right? Let's do it. At 4:40 in the afternoon, Police raided the headquarters Of black militant organization at 4547 Dorchester Avenue... [Laughing] Police have been informed a large cache Of illegal arms was hidden in the building. [Chortles] Well, they wanted a fight. Le's see how they handle this one. It looks like they're gonna have trouble for a long time. You still hold all the cars, Tony. There's general hysteria here. From what we understand, diablo, The head of the militant organization, Was not in the house when the raid took place. A set-up. A perfect set-up. What do you mean? There's no report as to their condition. One policeman has died and one is injured seriously. Three more have been taken to the hospital with minor wounds. What's going on, j.J? I got to call a lawyer to get some brothers out of jail. Ladies and gentlemen, there's a commotion Going down on down the street there. It looks like, yes, it's diablo. Let me see if I can talk to him. Here he comes now, ladies and gentlemen? Diablo, the leader of the organization. Diablo, what do you have to say about the police finding arms... Hello. J. Johnson here. Hey, let me speak with bill. Americans have the constitutional right To protect themselves and their property. Bill... A citizen isn't armed is a potential...
