I'm a town in Mexico, but my name does not matter. I own a church where my people find the comfort and shelter they need... whose bells transmit a message of hope and encouragement. I have a school, homes, small gardens. I'm alive. I'm full of life. My name doesn't matter because all towns are the same... although we have different languages, races and habits. Here or there, in this or the other continent... we are all one people, mostly good and honest. I can't even say I am different, because I too have suffered. I didn't acknowledge the little man, the construction worker, the artisan... and allowed tyrants and powerful men victimize my people. They carried their cross, subdued by fear. Other places have also neglected their lesser citizens... putting their fate in the hands of this or that tyranny. That's why it doesn't matter if I'm a town from Mexico. I am, after all, a town of this Earth. This is the symbol of time. We only know what's past, but never what the future holds... even if it's in the next minute. The mystery of the next minute... is that there's always a plan we cannot fathom. Therefore, our history is... a constant flow of minutes in the life of a man... until the fate of a certain minute puts an end to it... while time goes on without ever stopping. That's all. Stop right there! Your permit. Pedro Cardoza. Pedro Cardoza. Proceed. Proceed! ROSAURO CASTRO GRAIN TRADER -Rosauro Castro did it! -Silence! People show their true colors. When things get rough, his followers abandon him. INDEPENDENT PARTY VOTE PEDRO CARDOZA FOR MAYOR ROSETE ARANDA PUPPET SHOW Do they know who killed Cardoza? Many do, but few are talking. If it was Mr. Rosauro, better keep our mouths shut. -No one can speak up against Rosauro. -And it will stay that way. Maybe the new prosecutor will dare. -Maybe. -We can only hope. We saw the vultures circling... and there we found Pedro Cardoza, barely breathing. Any idea who might be the murderer? -Answer the man! -Well... We don't know anything. You know Cardoza was the first to dare launch his campaign... against Rosauro Castro's interests. Right? I don't think my compadre had anything to do with this, sir. Rosauro has always been a friend of the peasants. Isn't it right, Fidencio? Yes, sir. We all owe Mr. Rosauro a lot. What did he do for you? He lent me money when my crops froze over. And not only to me. He also helped out a bunch of people. Alright. You may go. It's all the same. Some are afraid of him, others owe him favors. In the end, no one dares speak against Rosauro Castro. You don't know enough about these towns, counselor. The law and the government have no business here. Reality is no match for these things. You seem to have no respect for your office. In spite of being Mayor. I didn't mean the local government. Citizens here respect that one. It should be the same. I'm here to enforce the law... and to punish the people who breach it. Very high aim, counselor. I'll be the first one to approve. People are happy the way things are right now, though. You'll see how all that about the law will only stir up things. Rosauro Castro has become an overlord... who wields his power outside the law. Not happy with owning most of the region's wealth... he also wants to have the power to designate political authorities... ignoring the will of the people. You're very mistaken. You have no right to question the legitimacy of men... whose only goal is to see to the welfare of our citizens. Everybody knows Rosauro has implemented a regime... of persecution, terror and murder. I'll gather proof to charge him eventually. Well, you'll have to get that proof, counselor. Otherwise you'd be committing with my compadre... the same injustice and abuse you complain of. Trust me, I'll have them sooner or later. Well, good luck with that, sir. Good morning, Mr. Rosauro. -It's Rosauro Castro! -Mr. Rosauro Castro is coming! Easy, Ruben. Calm down. First we bury your brother. Then we'll see. Alright. Murderer! Yes, I'm talking to you! Are you here to see your handiwork? There lies my son. Go in and see him with your own eyes, damned murderer. You're afraid. Are you afraid of a mother? A woman who yells at you and accuses you? My son lies in there. My dead boy! The one you took from me. Murderer! Murderer. Murderer... -You think they found him alive? -Maybe. Let's go see what my compadre has to say. That's Rosauro Castro, sir. And you? Didn't I say I don't want beggars here? There are jobs for all. You just have to want to work. Sabino, write down their names and put them to work at the ranch. Bunch of good-for-nothings. Out of my way! Move! You can see it in his eyes. -What was that, sir? -Nothing. Hey, compadre! Is that your way of announcing your visit? You beat me to the target. Good shooting, though, truth be told. Don't worry, compadre. It was my lucky gun. Don't go anywhere. I want to talk to you. Show me that lucky gun that never misses a shot. Some say it's cursed. It's not the gun, though. It's the shooter. -Any news at the ranch? -None. What about you? The only news is the man from the prosecutor's office. He's here to prevent any incidents in the election. What does he mean by that? Aren't you here to make sure of it? This is my compadre Rosauro Castro. Mr. Garc√≠a Maza, sent by the government. Pleasure. Come on in. From the government, huh? Look here, counselor. I mean no offense... but frankly, I don't know why they sent you. You don't know? I'll tell you. The authorities are unwilling to tolerate what's going on here. Yes, compadre. He also says he must investigate the Cardoza affair. You know he was killed, don't you? I heard the bad news when I rode into town. Pedro Cardoza's poor mother breaks my heart, you know? Truth be told, men like Pedro Cardoza should think twice... before doing anything. Just look at the pain he's caused... that poor woman who brought him into the world. Now that you mention it, Mr. Castro... men like... like the ones who took the life of that woman's son... should also think twice. As of today, the law will be upheld in this town... and crimes will be punished. No one will oppose you. We fully agree. Right, compadre? Just don't forget, sir, you have an odd way of looking at things. Everything you know comes from books. What do you want me to say? Books don't teach you everything. You need to live in a place like this to experience the passions. One only needs common sense to determine who breaks the law and who abides it. I'm telling you it's not that easy. Look. I'll set myself as an example. My enemies don't appreciate the good things I do here. But the moment anything bad happens... it's Rosauro Castro this, Rosauro Castro that. I'd have to live many years, counselor... to do all the things they accuse me of. I'm not here to take sides. But I must warn you, Mr. Castro... that the few things I've heard about your behavior... don't do you any favors. I'm not the kind of man who changes his behavior just because. Let alone because someone who knows nothing tells me to! Nobody is telling you anything, compadre. The counselor here just has a way of talking about legal stuff... that us regular folk find hard to understand. Well, this counselor should reconsider the way he talks... lest we misjudge him. So, compadre... did poor Pedro Cardoza get to say anything? No, he was unconscious when they found him. And I think the killers were outsiders. As long as we have you for Mayor, compadre... I know justice and reason will always prevail. And you, counselor, I'm at your service... at home, where you'll be welcome. Dad! My daddy! Come here, son. Come on! Up you go! Just look at how dirty you are. Tell me, what have you been up to? I'm so glad you came, dad. When are you taking me to the ranch? Today? Today? What about school? Why aren't you in school? Mom told me not to go. -Is that right? -Yes. Thank God you're here. I was afraid something had happened to you. Why didn't Angel go to school? I asked you a question. Why didn't he go to school? Answer me! Your mother and I didn't want him to go. Ask her. Rosauro! Son! Coming, mother. Will you take me to the puppet show, dad? Yes, son. After you go to school. Go with your mother, Angelito. Why didn't you take him to school? Marta and I decided not to. So the other kids wouldn't tell him what's being said around town. Go with your mother, son. What is it they're saying? That Pedro Cardoza was murdered. I heard as much. And they say it was you. Who's saying that? Cardoza's mother came here herself. She cursed me, cursed our home and cursed our bloodline. But you don't believe that, do you, mother? I wish I didn't. I'll just say one thing. I'd rather be in that woman's shoes, and not in mine. Would you... Would you rather see me dead? Your hands are bloodstained, son. Pedro Cardoza was going to do a lot of harm. Harm who? The town or you? Same thing. They refuse to understand I seek the greater good. What will I tell God about you, son? Tell me! What do I tell God? I'll only say my conscience is clear. That's all. You should go see Father Lorenzo, make your peace with God so... No, mother. You might believe in all that, but I don't. I can't, no matter if I want to. Leave! Leave! Leave me with your sins and mine. Dad, why didn't granny let me go to school? No reason, son. Women's foolishness. You like your father, don't you? Yes, dad. That's why all the kids are afraid of me. I'll take you to school. I will take him myself, see if they dare bully him. Have it your way, Rosauro. If you want my advice, don't cross paths with him. I'll leave tomorrow. Chabelo, did Rosauro give you permission to come back? If he didn't, you must be out of your mind. I'll take the risk. I came to get my girlfriend and my family. Well, you'd better do it fast. Are things so bad around here? Pedro Cardoza was killed yesterday. They say he killed him. The funeral is this afternoon. Poor Pedro. He was the only one here who'd stand up to Rosauro Castro. -Is Rosauro here? -He arrived at noon. -Do you think I'm next? -God only knows. -See you around. -See you. Beatriz? Your brother is here. -Beatriz! -Chabelo, my son! Mother. Your last letter said you were up and about. I'm back in bed, but it's no big deal, son. I'm so glad to see you. You shouldn't have come, though. In spite of everything, your sister and I manage. Thank God you're finally back, Chabelo! I'm so sorry about Pedro. I just came to take you away from here as soon as possible. I thought you were coming to stay. I won't let Rosauro Castro kill me when I least expect it. I just want to marry Celia... and live in peace far away from here. We can settle down in Real de Azucena. I hear they're giving out land. I also wanted to marry Pedro Cardoza. We were going to live in peace, together. If you want to leave though, fine, Chabelo. I'm staying. Take mom and Celia with you. You have a right to be happy! I won't be. Leave me. Leave me! Have you seen Celia already? Not yet. She comes here every day to ask about you... and to get your letters. SCHOOL Chabelo! Good afternoon. Look. Go, Chabelo. I'll see you after school. See you at my house. Hey, Chabelo. -When did you arrive? -What's up, Damian? You really are a piece of work. Apparently, you're fearless. Watch your back, though. You don't mess with Rosauro Castro. -See you. -See you, Damian. You get all dressed up to take the boy to school. -Ready, son? -Yes, dad. No, Sabino, you're not coming. Shouldn't I come with you, Mr. Rosauro? I'm not alone. I have my defender right here. Sabino! -Yes, ma'am? -Go with Rosauro. -Don't leave him alone, no matter what. -Yes, Mrs. Margarita. He's gone to see her. He's gone to see that woman, Mother Margarita! Hello, Mrs. Esperanza. Have a good one. See you later. I'll be expecting you. Hello, Salvador. Do you have it? Of course, Mr. Rosauro. It's the best in the capital; one of the latest models. And the perfume, not even Cleopatra had one like this! -How does it shoot, dad? -Look, I'll show you. Didn't I tell you not to come? Wait for me in the square. Oh, poor thing! Don Rosauro! The man really knows how to shoot. He's so good. SCHOOL Look, dad, a dead man. Yes, son. A dead man. Inside, children, inside. Why do people die, dad? Because we all have to die, son. Sit down! Here's my boy, ma'am. I don't want him missing school. You shouldn't have brought him in today. Why? Things like the one you just saw might shock him. Maybe you're the one who's shocked. He can't bring weapons to school. Pardon me, ma'am, but this is not a weapon; it's a toy. Here, son. Sit down. -And you, sit down. -Thank you. Good afternoon, ma'am. I've warned your mother many times, Chabelo. Her health is precarious. Perhaps she'll listen to you. Nice to see you, Chabelo. I thought you wouldn't want to come back... after your troubles last time. I also said I'd drag you out of town behind my horse! I came to get my family. It'll just be a few days; my mother is very ill. I'll send your mother a doctor and pay all the bills. But you're a different story, Chabelo. You have until five this afternoon to get the hell out! You hear? Five o'clock! Listen, Rosauro. I think you're wrong about Chabelo Campos. Wrong? That's the last thing I expected from you, compadre. I just want you to remember there's that government official. We should at least keep up appearances. That again. I don't care about that man. It's not the first time they try to frame me. Well, I just want you to tread carefully, compadre. The Pedro Cardoza affair is still fresh. No need to go around looking for more trouble. It'll be a sad day when Rosauro Castro has to take into account Chabelo Campos. If I let them undermine my authority, it'll be the end of Rosauro Castro. I'd rather you see me dead right here before that happens. You've really changed, compadre. Well, see you around. It's time. -You tell him. -No, you tell him. -What is it? -It's nearly five, Mr. Rosauro. Alright. Your compadre Antonio dropped by before you arrived. He did? He asked me to persuade you to allow Chabelo to stay in town. I thought my compadre had more important things to do. Chabelo's mother is ill. If you forgive him, he'll probably behave from now on. You know I don't like women butting into my own affairs. What if I asked you? It could be my gift. Today's my namesake. Well, what else can I do? Only because it's my compadre. -Fidel. -Yes, sir? Go to Chabelo's place and tell him he can stay. -Just tell him to toe the line. -Yes, sir. I thought it would be best. But now, with my mother so ill, I don't want to leave. You have to, Chabelo. I came for you, for my mother and Beatriz. Now I'll have to leave by myself. You'll say I'm a coward. No, you're being forced to leave. As long as we have to suffer this tyrant, there's no choice. I'll always love you. You're what I want the most. The only thing I have. Your blessing, mother. I'm leaving. Don't worry, son. If God spares me, we'll see each other again, wherever you are. Come on, Chabelo, time's almost up. Rosauro's men will be here any moment now. For God's sake, go. Go, son! There are things that matter more than a man's will. No matter how hard you try, they're stronger. I'm not leaving! I cannot! I'm staying, and I'll face whatever I need to face, mother. Is Chabelo here? I have a message from Mr. Rosauro. He was just leaving, sir. Thing is he doesn't have to leave anymore. Mr. Rosauro gave him permission to stay. It's nothing but the truth. How can you not believe his word? He told me so himself. He just said Chabelo must walk a straight line from now on. Mr. Rosauro has a good heart. Tell Chabelo so he won't worry. See you around! Tell me. What can I do for you? I need you to guarantee my safety. I'm surprised. Everybody here is entitled to their safety. What will this man think? He's a government representative. Don't try to scare me, Mr. Antonio. He will think it's the truth: That no one's safety is guaranteed as long as Rosauro Castro rules. Watch your tongue, Chabelo! It's not my fault things weren't done before like they should. Things have changed now. -What kind of guarantee do you want? -I want the authorities to protect me. One of Castro's men went to my house to throw me out of town. Are you sure those were his intentions? Throw you out of town? You yourself witnessed Rosauro's threats! I think you're wrong, Chabelo. You cannot go around telling lies about the authorities. You can leave now. And stop wearing that gun. I'd like to speak to you, Chabelo. Sit down. Tell me. What's your problem with Rosauro Castro? It is ancient history, sir. It's not a problem, though; it's abuse! I was going to sell some wheat in San Juan... because Rosauro offered too low a price. The night before, my ranch went up in flames. Rosauro told me to leave town if I didn't want something worse to happen. It was all noted in a complaint, but nothing came of it, and I had to go. Let me clear up that Mr. Antonio wasn't Mayor back then. I've gone through all the files, but there's no such complaint. Were there witnesses? The Cardozas declared in my favor. In any case, you're the first one bold enough to speak up. Would you be willing to make a formal statement... before Rosauro Castro himself? Yes, sir. Would you be so kind as to summon Rosauro Castro here, in an hour? Very well, counselor. You'll give a written statement; then you'll persuade the Cardozas... to come here as soon as possible before we proceed. Tell my compadre Rosauro I'm at Juanito's bar. It's urgent. Watch him for me. Don't be long, dad. The best part is coming. I'll be right back. Chabelo has pressed formal charges against you. My advice, compadre, is that you try and stop things. How ungrateful of him! Just when I forgave him for his mistakes. Well, compadre, you know best. Juanito. Don't you think this bar is a bit too crowded? I think so, sir. I'm very sorry, boys. You'd better leave. You can't deny us a drink in these circumstances, Juanito. You know we just buried our brother. Don't come looking for trouble. You'd better go. Juanito, have you seen the Cardozas? Don't go, Chabelo. I wanted to see you. Yes, come here. I heard about your schemes. Apparently you refuse to see reality. This place is becoming too small for the two of us. We'll just have to make do, Rosauro. The law's on my side now. And if you don't want to leave, well... neither do I. Carrying a gun, huh? Nice little gun. Let me take a look. Take it out yourself. Give it to me, I said! You want me holding the gun so you can say it was self-defense, right? -Smartass. -No, I just know you too well. Put it away, Juanito. These things are no good unless they're in a man's hands. And you, make yourself scarce. Go! -Pour me a drink. -Yes, Mr. Rosauro. No, don't! No, Rosauro! No! I'm unarmed, Rosauro. I'm unarmed! No! No, Rosauro. Don't! No! Don't, Rosauro! No! Don't, Rosauro! Don't you think we've waited for Chabelo Campos long enough? I have a feeling he won't show up. If neither Chabelo nor the Cardozas show up... I have Chabelo's signed statement anyway. Those papers have no value! To me, they have a different value... and it's not exactly legal. It's moral. They don't fear you as much as before, Rosauro. Is that right? Look, counselor, stop dilly-dallying. Forgive me, but let us speak clearly. What am I being accused of? Tell me once and for all what you're up to. Among other things, I'm about to prove... you're behind the fire that burned Chabelo Campos' ranch. And that you killed Pedro Cardoza, or had him killed. -Well, prove it soon. Otherwise... -Otherwise, what? I'll be forced to escort you out of town and have you processed for slander. Don't forget I have the governor's support... and Mr. Antonio's as well... since it is his duty to assist me. Very interesting. What do you say to that, compadre? It's my duty to help him uphold the law, Rosauro... let's not give him reasons... to think you manipulate the authorities as you please. Very well. There are some ungrateful men who put the law above friendship... and friendship is sacred. Let's see how things stand. I don't give without expecting something in return. I see that as a formal declaration of war. What else could it be? Look, I'm fed up with all these investigations leading nowhere. So if you'll excuse me... I need to have my fun. I'm just wasting my time here. If there's anything you need, send for me. Mr. Antonio here knows where to find me. You've had your say. I hope to prove I'm right, very soon. Don't hurry too much, sir. You're the one hurrying towards your fate. You're the one hurrying towards your fate, Rosauro. You're the one hurrying towards your fate, Rosauro. See you later at Esperanza's. What's this? What you see, Rosauro. It was bound to happen sooner or later. I'm leaving! The sooner the better. -And my son is coming with me! -No way! If you want to go, go right now. By yourself. You hear? By yourself! No one will take him from me. Only God. Only God! Only God. We'll see. Get out! -Get out of here, I said! -Rosauro! Will anything ever stop you? There is your judge. There's your son! No one will tear this home apart as long as I'm alive. This is not a home. It's a curse from God. Come, Angelito. Come here, sweetheart. Don't be scared. No one will make you leave this house. You'll always live here with Mama Marta... with your father... and with me... until God wills it. Put him to bed, Rosauro. We have to be very careful with Rosauro now. There's something inhumane which seems to drive him. Now we can only ask God to help him. I always want to be with you, and with mom and granny. Don't you love my mom? I forgot to pray, dad! Do you pray before bed? Dear God, don't let anything happen to Mama Margarita... or to Mama Marta. Or to my dad or to me. Amen. You least of all, son. Now get into bed. Sleep now, alright? -Dad, don't go! -Go to bed, now! They should be happy I was hit by the first shot. If they hadn't, we would be having two more funerals. The man who'll kill Rosauro Castro hasn't been born yet. How are you doing, counselor? Nice to see you. Now you know who actually needs guarantees in this town. Take a good look. This is what happens when you stir up people who want me dead. And you say it's because they don't fear me anymore. We heard what happened... and we need the facts to write up a statement. Simple. I was shot as I left my house. What about you, compadre? I thought I'd never have the pleasure of seeing you again. Forget that, compadre. Nothing's happened between us two. I'm here to see if you need anything. Thank you, Antonio. Esperanza! Drinks for my compadre and for the gentleman. We have reasons to celebrate now. We'll have our drinks and leave at once. I need to make my rounds. We wouldn't want these people to keep wreaking havoc. Very well. Hurry up, Esperanza! Some music! Fidel! Sabino! Bring those musicians in. Get cracking! Rosauro! Rosauro! Rosauro! Rosauro! Rosauro... What the hell are you doing here? Get out! Your son... What about my son? Is that your excuse now? They killed him. They killed him! What? Have you lost your mind? He was hit by a stray bullet. I found him dead by the window. Angel. Angel! Son... I'm talking to you! Angel. Angel... This is what you call a punishment from God. I killed him myself, mother. I shot towards that window. Only God. Only God! No! They did it! They took him from me! Rosauro! Let him go, honey. Nothing will stop him. My God, forgive all our sins. Look, dad, a dead man. INDEPENDENT PARTY VOTE PEDRO CARDOZA FOR MAYOR Stop, compadre! Stop, I say! I'm your best friend. Listen to me, listen to reason. Stop! Don't make me shoot you, compadre. Right, compadre. You beat me... to the target. THE END
