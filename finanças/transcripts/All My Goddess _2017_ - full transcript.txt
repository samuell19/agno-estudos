Oh, Mr. Wang. I am so sorry for being late. What is it? I'm so excited to see you all. Excuse me. I'll be right back. - Hello. - What happened? - What? Getting married? - Getting married? BUSINESS DIRECTOR LILLIAN ZHOU LOSES FACE IN LUXURY RESTAURANT LILLIAN ZHOU TAKES ADVANTAGE OF HER BEAUTY TO GET PROMOTION LILLIAN ZHOU SUDDENLY BECOMES PRETTY AFTER GROWING UP - What are you looking at? - Nothing. - These are your rooms. - We will talk later. Jessie Zhang, will you take Gary Li to be your lawfully wedded husband, to have and to hold from this day forward, for better, for worse, for richer, for poorer, in sickness and in health, until death do you part? - I do. - Cut! Jessie... when you say "I," remember to raise your chin, raise it, raise it, that's right. But don't bend to the side too much... HEY, PRETTY GIRL. NICE TO MEET YOU. ...because the camera will be on this side. This way, the camera can fully capture your beautiful profile. - Right? - Like this? ONE MORE THING. Right, just like that. Then you smile a little. Roses again? You're so uncreative. - All beautiful women love roses. - What did you say? I said, roses plus a beautiful woman equals timeless perfection. Gals, this is Gary, and he will be my husband in 60 hours. Don't get fooled by him now, he often drives me crazy. Your Highness, it is entirely my fault. From now on I will only listen to you, is that okay? You are so lucky to be able to find a man who loves and cares for you, even with your princess complex. Let me tell you something. A great writer once wrote, "If a woman thinks that she is equally as good as a man, then she is wrong." Since ancient times, women have always been better than men. When a man gives a woman something, she will return it in double, even triple. Oh, I have heard this. If he gives her a sperm, she'll give him a child. If he gives her a house, she'll give him a home. If he gives her a smile, she'll give him her heart. Regardless of what is given to the woman, she will give double, triple, or many more times back. But if you plan on talking trash, then be prepared to go to the landfill. So, we're handing this spoiled princess over to you. You must protect her and never treat her badly, okay? Don't worry, Jessie is the love of my life. I promise to be forever faithful to her. Congratulations, Jessie. Don't worry, don't worry. Jessie. Be happy. I told you already, the workers said they won't work - until they've received the payment. - Wow, five times six is 30, seven times eight is 56. Hey, Mr. Best Man. So, when can we get our payment? Don't raise your voice. We are in the same boat now. I don't mind telling you, and you cannot tell anyone this. Me being the best man is just a cover. The truth is, the groom owes me a lot of money, and this wedding is actually a way for him to pay me back. Not only will I get all the cash and gifts, I've also lined up loads of sponsors, so make sure you're alert at all times. We have to pull off a great wedding, okay? The thing is, they're not willing to work. You can tell I'm loyal just by looking at me, right? Don't say I don't take care of lower-class people like you, I've already paid you the 1% deposit according to the contract. I'll give you the rest after the wedding. I'll pay you more if there's any extra. Don't get so worked up, look at my loyal face. You've already started this, and there is no going back. The groom is a famous, rich second generation, so many celebrities have been invited to the wedding. Go see if any of your friends are willing to come volunteer. Tell them there'll be many beautiful celebrities, I'm sure that will make them come. I shot a lot of films when I was at uni. I wrote and directed them myself, and I sometimes had to act in them, too. So, if I have to do this, I believe I'm capable of it. So young and promising! Let's get to work! Wow! Just let it go... if we can't go on like this, then why drag it out? Let's just get a divorce. We've been married for eight years, our son is seven years old... and now you say we should get a divorce? Are you incapable of thinking of others? When have you ever thought of me and our son? Fine. I'll pay you alimony, I won't even fight for Justin. Just let me go. - Then who will let me go? - Elaine, let's go! - Coming! - I bet you forgot your sunscreen, you look so tanned. - Really? - I'll let you try this SPF100 sunscreen. SPF100? Won't it destroy my face? MERLOT 2000, BORDEAUX, SOUR FLAVOR See for yourself. I take it you gals are the bride's girlfriends? Hi, I'm Gary's best man, Prince. I'm here to take you to the wedding venue. Huh? He's Eddie Peng? Gary's wedding will be spectacular. He has invited many celebrities and famous businessmen, TV stations will be broadcasting live. He is currently doing interviews, so I'll show you gals around the venue and see what needs sorting out. - Sure. - This way, please. YOUR CAPPUCCINO IS MY POLAROID. That's my book. It's a great read. - Wow, how come you are so careless! - Hey, you're the only one who'd notice it. You neck looks stiff, haven't you been to yoga in a while? I don't have time for that silly thing, it's a waste of time. Watch out! Wearing a jacket in this kind of weather is really... - What's the matter? - We can speak here. What do you want to say? How long will you be staying here? I'm leaving after the wedding. Can I come see you? Hey! How are you still on your phone, we've got a lot to do, get your butt in here. How can it be so messy? Hey! Hey! Don't tie the balloons here, tie them to the pillar. What should we do? Listen to her. TOGETHER, FOREVER So careless. Where did the other two go? Listen, you've called 189 times and texted 273 times since I landed. The fact I haven't responded means that I'm still thinking things through. We are husband and wife, do you have to be this forceful? Listen, don't think for a second that I'll just let you and Han MeiMei off so easily. Sign your ass! Where have you and your son been all day? Did you see Elaine? I can't stand her, she thinks she's the star of the party. She keeps going around trying to do business. She's only a flight attendant. She is no heiress! She's quite sad actually. She thought she'd scored with a rich second generation, but he's actually the child of a mistress, and no one likes him. His father gave him some money and threw him out. LiLei goes out to do business, but he has to rely on his wife showing up to help line up deals, or else their family of three couldn't survive. A family of four actually! There's also the mistress. - Oh, right! - Elaine couldn't face the fact that "wife" is only a title. Angela, Mrs. Wang! Thank you so much for the support tonight, I'm won't disturb you girls. See you around. Why pretend to have something you don't? You don't look like you have a boyfriend. What kind of a director is that? Why does it take so long to do an interview? It's not difficult to talk behind people's back. You're doing it now. - What did you say? - What did you say? What are you saying? RUN AWAY - Where are you taking me? - Okay, we can begin. I heard you girls are the bride's best girlfriends? We were all flight attendants at the time I started first, Lillian came back from overseas and she started at the same time as Jessie, then Rosa was the last to join. There was some tension at first. You know women, there's always a clash of different personalities. Any memorable moments? Jessie is the most romantic out of the four of us, she couldn't live without love, and this is exactly why she is always bullied by men. I remember one day at work. - What happened to your hand? - That one, that one. Did he hit you? No. Hey, where are you going? - Then what? - What else? We tracked the bastard down and beat the crap out of him. Bastard! Who could have known she'd be the most vicious in the end? - We are the Four Queens of the Sky. - Why does it have to be this pose? Lastly, what do you want to say to the bride as the only married bridesmaid? I want to let Jessie know that you need to be tolerant. Even if the knife is right against your neck, you have to tolerate it and pretend nothing has happened. If you give up, then you lose. Done. Come look at this. - Can you see any problems? - Nope. Never mind, I'll do it myself. Hello, Mom, yes, I'm working. Hey, can you concentrate while you're working? I'm being yelled at to get back to work. Shall I wait till you're done? CONGRATULATIONS Miss Lillian Zhou? There's some pollen. Any more? Ms. Zhou. I'd love to get one too. Miss Chen. Ms. Zhou. I am not a bad guy. - What's with the two of you? - It's all your fault. Hey, what a coincidence. You doing some thinking out here? That's great. What's the matter? Oh, too many pictures in your mobile phone and you're running out of storage? Let me help you, I know how to fix this. What beautiful pictures. I'm sorry. I think I shared all your pictures. It doesn't matter, whoever received all those beautiful pictures will be very happy. I know I'd love to get one too. Aren't you lucky, getting just a slap for sharing a girl's unedited pictures. - Then I guess she's very kind to me. - Not bad. Excuse me, have you seen the other bridesmaids? Damn it, I've been looking for you, there's something we need to discuss. - Are you talking to me? - Elaine, you are the classiest out of everyone here. The audience tomorrow includes celebrities and stars of the business world, right? I won't bother you during the day, as you'll be busy being a bridesmaid. But how about co-hosting with me in the evening? - With you? - I'll dress nicely. I can be very elegant and charming. I will look great next to you. - Come on, look at this. - What do you want? Let's look at this together, this is the MC script. "Steamed lobster with garlic, brought to you by Wei Kei Seafood." - This is what I'm saying? Easy. - Yes. "Fried scallops with XO sauce, brought to you by Pearl Limited." "Abalone with goose feet, brought to you by..." "...brought to you by Chiu Kei Diner." "Steamed grouper, brought to you by Regent Cruises." - That's right. - Why is every dish sponsored? It's normal, we separate them into smaller parts to earn more money. What? I mean separate the dishes into smaller parts and the guests will be happy as well. - All right, let's continue. - As for tonight's champagne, - it's brought to you by Dom Perrier. - It's Dom Perignon. Yeah. That's close enough. Oh, no, Jessie is missing. - Well, get her back. - I can't find her anywhere. - Oh, no. Rosa, Lillian. - You're kidding, right? Okay, got it. - Only lingerie is gone. - I've looked everywhere. - The makeup artist hasn't seen her either. - How could you lose your fiancée? I can't be guarding her at all times, can I? - Her phone is switched off. - I bet she's been kidnapped. - What? That's impossible! - Call the police! My plane will depart in one minute, and I don't know where I'll be in three hours. I'm sorry everyone, I think I need to live an independent life. I'm not going to get married. - Jessie is so spoiled. - She has always been a free spirit. - You can't joke about getting married. - If that's so, then it's game over, cancel everything, and let's go pack. Hey, hey, hey! Hang on! Let me warn you, Mr. so-called rich second generation, if the wedding gets canceled, there will be no cash or gifts, there will be no paying me back, and you'll need to compensate the sponsors and the TV station for their losses. You may even face a lawsuit and have to go to prison. You know there is no way you'd survive prison. Right, this wedding cannot be canceled! I told you this girl was not to be trusted. What can I do without a bride? I thought you were going to Thailand? Yes, but I don't know if I can book the tickets. What have I done to deserve this? Why has Jessie done this to me? You are all her friends. Tell me, how could this happen? The TV station has already set up and is all ready for tomorrow's live broadcast. How could she let me face this all by myself? Let's think of a way to solve this. No! The wedding must go on, and there will be no more extra branches. - Any extra branches will need to be cut! - What are you talking about? Cut? There is no bride, how do we go on with this? We don't need to cut anything. There's nothing wrong with the wedding, actually. - All we need is a bride. - How about this. One of you, put on the wedding dress! How can you joke about this? - You think we're just playing in the sand? - I have to say this to be fair to Gary. Jessie left because she has been unfaithful to Gary. She left because she's too ashamed to face Gary. - Gary, show them. - Don't say another word, I love her no matter what she did. Look, Jessie was unfaithful. I caught her with a young salesman in the mall once. I wanted to go slap her, but I had to think about Gary, so I filmed them and showed it to Gary. Who knew Gary could be so brave and struggle alone in the dark. How could Jessie do this? I can't believe it was with a boy who sponges off women. Is Jessie mad? How could she do this right before getting married? Please don't say any more bad things about her. Please have some compassion for this poor man. If we work together, we can get Gary through this terrible time. There's nothing left I can do. Jessie is an orphan. She has always kept a low profile. The reporters won't know who she is. There shouldn't be a problem if we switch the bride to someone else, right? The Li Family cannot be humiliated like this. Please help me. This wedding must not be canceled! You have to be fully prepared. There are only two days left. You have to track Jessie down, get your gangster friends to help out. We must get her back. There are three women available to us here. We'll be okay as long as one says yes. Right! We have to go both ways, even if we can't find Jessie, we still have the other three. I'm sorry, but someone actually has to say yes. I've always said you don't know anything about women. Do you really think they are not willing, just because they said they don't want to? Gary, everything is going according to plan, right? If so, then I would like to go and prepare. Yes, yes. You go work, thank you. Sorry. - There are still three choices, right? - Destiny... I'm married, I can only be the MC, there's no way I'm going to be the bride. - Neither can I, I'm not that shallow. - Me neither, I have a boyfriend. - Wow, your boyfriend is so handsome? - What are you doing? - Jessie is ridiculous! - Gary has to sacrifice so much. Gary is so much better than that boy toy. You know what? Jessie doesn't love Gary. If you truly love someone, you can't just let go like that. I just hope that boy toy is good to our Jessie. Pigs will fly the day men are dependable. Is that so? Would you leave early? Girl trouble? Just send it. Even though I've sent it, she won't respond. Is it so hard to try to understand someone? Hey, bro, are you okay? I want my fishing rod back, please. What a crazy guy! The world is mine. SHENG NV PU ZE See you tomorrow, bye-bye. - Hello. - Hello. May I have your autograph, please? -Of course -Thank you. What is art? - Art is truth, kindness and beauty. - What do you mean? It's not that difficult to understand, is it? Think about this, do you know who was the richest man in the UK 400 years ago? And who was the king at the time? I'm just like you. Who would remember such things? But there's always one person we will always remember. Shakespeare. His works were written 400 years ago, but people all around the world are still performing it. Even our very own Tang Xianzu. Go on. - That's why art, for me, is eternity. - Anything else? Still haven't found our bride. Get everyone to go look for her. A lot of sponsors means a lot of money. We only have one day left. - Plan B! - It's a must. Just because I agreed to have dinner with you tonight doesn't mean that I'll talk to Lillian and Rosa for you. This is, after all, a very important decision. They need to decide themselves. Why would you think I'm trying to talk them into the wedding but not you? Oh, come on, I've been married for eight years. Marriages are flexible. People get divorced and remarry. There's even a time limit for buying a house, let alone marriage. I am very happy with my husband. It doesn't sound like you mean that. People can tell your real feelings no matter what you say. You'd better find your fiancée first, Mr. Psychiatrist. Do you know what your most beautiful feature is? What? Your forehead is very elegant. Women with a forehead like yours include Wu Zetian... Empress of China... Princess Diana. Sir and madam. Tonight's menu is a fusion of eastern and western, prepared by our chef who came all the way from Hangzhou. This is Longjing shrimp. Enjoy. I heard your husband is doing business now. Has he been using you? There's no reason why a woman should live such a harsh life. Enough, you're just making fun of me. There's a chance for you to re-live your life all over again. It's just a matter of whether or not you take this chance. I'm done with the Hangzhou cuisine, you enjoy the rest. Justin. How many times has Mommy told you... not to get so close to strangers? Come on, come home with Mommy. Come here. I said come home with me. Let's go home, come home with me. - What are you doing? Come home with me. - Enough with this madness, are you crazy? Isn't the bed too small... for three adults? - Then let's face it. - I just want to know one thing... what did I do wrong? What can she give you that I can't? One thing... She understands me. - Why are you here? - I don't even know. I don't have any life goals. I just follow my feelings. That's not right. Us young people must have dreams. How are you any different from a turtle if you don't have dreams? - Isn't the saying "salted fish"? - No. Why a turtle? I don't know, I'm just following my feelings. Come back quickly, Gary is still waiting for you. Why did you say yes in the first place anyway? What would you like to order? Noodles with luncheon meat and fried eggs please. I'll have the same. Waiting for your boyfriend? - Can't I be single? - Single? That's impossible. - Why? - You're such a cute girl. There're at least thousands, if not millions of men out there. Millions? Well, they need to be right for me. Let me put it this way. Where I live has a population of around seven million people, half of those people are women. Then there're more than three million men. What about age? One third is underage and another one third are seniors. - There's still a million. - Half of this million is married, 10% are gay, high school dropouts, ugly, bald or have stinky feet. Well, there's at least one that can be your boyfriend. Then there are men who are shorter than me, don't want kids, or hate them. Then there really is no one. Only women are like this, though? This is what most men would do. They put all the women in their mouths... chew, and spit them out. As for me, I would pick one... and eat it without spitting it out. Finish your meal and then go back to work. I'm working, I can't eat. You know my family waited all night at the restaurant for you? It was my mom's birthday today! The computer screen is your mom, the keyboard is your dad, the mouse is your best friend... and your phone is your life. How did you ever become a flight attendant? I have social anxiety... Don't be so negative, you just haven't met Mr. Right yet. I heard this story about this scholar. His fiancée left him and married someone else. The scholar was so heartbroken, he got really sick. A monk found him one day and showed him a mirror. In the mirror, he saw the sea. A dead woman's body lay naked on the beach. People were just glancing at it and walking on by. Then, there came two men. One took off his shirt and covered the body. The other dug a hole and buried the body. The monk said the dead body was the fiancée in her previous life. The man who took off his shirt was, in fact, the scholar. To return this favor, she fell in love with the scholar in this life. But the person she needed to repay for the rest of her life was the man who buried her, the man she married in this life. I think the men you've met so far were just men who gave you their shirt. Prince. Yes! Your mission is... - to make Rosa fall in love with you. - What? - I don't think that's a good idea. - Why not? You think I can make her fall in love? You have to. For the wedding tomorrow, you have to get me the girl! - Get you the girl? - Yes. - I have to get you the girl? - I've logged onto my WeChat account. Rosa is dumb and naive, you have to trap her heart fully, you understand? I have to go deal with another woman. Come on, chop, chop. Excuse me, what room is Miss Lillian Zhou staying in? I'm sorry, sir. I'm not allowed to tell you that information - for customer privacy. - Don't worry, we're good friends, I just want to give her something personally. - That's against our rules. - I'm not a bad guy. Are you a reporter? - No, I'm the director. - Well, you're with the media. You want to know about me? I was just wondering, out of curiosity, if you would like... Stop harassing me, or else I'll cut your dick off! Have you lost your mind? Don't even think about it! There's a chance for you to re-live your life all over again. It's just a matter of whether or not you take this chance. You are a pig looking into a mirror, why can't the ugly duckling turn into a swan? There're are no ugly women, only lazy ones. You're bound to be a beautiful woman if you spend some time dressing yourself up. I'm so hardworking, why are people still against me? Lillian, my client is on her way to the airport and he wants to see the figures immediately. - There's a black folder on my desk. - Can't we just email him? This client doesn't read emails. What shoes are you wearing today? Don't you have those six-inch heels? This client has a fetish, so the higher the heel, the better. At the clubhouse, have you found it? Hello, hey, this way. Doesn't read emails... Wait for me outside. Yes. What did I ever do to you? I've always been loyal to you. Don't pretend! I've been working here for 20 years, why are they transferring me to Zambia all of a sudden? You'll become CEO once I leave. If I got promoted, it is because I'm capable of doing it. Everyone knows you use your beauty. Yes, you're capable. Capable of sleeping your way to the top. Look at your face, everyone knows you've had work done. Maybe improve your knowledge a little bit more. Capable? When I was younger, I really was capable. - Justin, my dear, how are you today? - Daddy cooked for me today. - He doesn't know how to cook. - Daddy and Auntie MeiMei - cooked for me in the kitchen. - She is not your Auntie! But Daddy said I should love Auntie MeiMei just as I love Mommy. Daddy kissed me and Auntie MeiMei, and said, "This is love." He isn't your father, you don't have a father like that. LiLei, why can't you behave yourself in front of your child? - Must you bring that old woman home? - Please just sign the papers. Why should I? What are you looking at, I'm going to pull those eyes out. I'm sorry, this is great, this case is great. There's a chance for you to re-live your life all over again. It's just a matter of whether or not you take this chance. I'm a bit hungry. I didn't order anything. Eat me if you're hungry. Gary. It would be great if there was music. What are you doing? Mr. Gary Lee wishes her to have music to accompany her as she enjoys her meal. Gary? I've decided... Would there be any disagreement if I were to be the bride? What makes you think we won't disagree? Just because she is anti-social, so she's out! As for you, you're married. Can't I just get a divorce? - What about your husband? - Don't mention him! You were just saying yesterday how happy you are with your husband. And today is a different story. You change faster than the weather. Enough is enough. Our relationship is none of your business! - Stop fighting, stop fighting. - I've been in such a bad mood lately. Save it, no one in this world would believe you even if you told them you'd had no work done. I'm not going fight with you now. The most important thing is what Gary thinks of us. He told me, I have a chance to re-live my life all over again. It's... It's just a matter of whether or not you take this chance. - How do you know? - Because he told me the exact same thing. - Gary? - How's the music? I really hope you'll think about this, Rosa. There's a chance for you to re-live your life all over again. It's just a matter of whether or not you take this chance. - You need to get to the point now! - I don't think it's a manly thing to do. Really! A real man shouldn't be doing all these sneaky things. Nonsense, there is nothing wrong with it! I'm so ashamed of myself for being your friend. Your name may be Prince, but don't think for a second that you're actually a prince. You are just a rich man's dog. - I don't think this is a good idea. - This doesn't concern you. I mean, I'm also one of the choices. Come on, quick. - Jessie! - Hey gals! - Jessie! - Where are you now exactly? Let me introduce someone. This is my new boyfriend. When I saw him performing on stage, I fell for him, hook, lime and stinker. I mean, hook, line and sinker. Hello, everyone, I'm from Hangzhou. You guys must be mad at me for leaving like this. - We've gone mad. - We have gone insane. That's why I want to explain everything now. - You're just now thinking of explaining? - I want to hear this explanation. I dated Gary for four years... and I thought he was the one. I knew he liked to fool around, but I tolerated it because I thought he was the one. - Who was tolerating whom? - Let her speak. I thought he would change for me, but I caught him fooling around with someone just few days ago. You two lead equally wonderful lives, That woman's name is Leng BingBing, she's a teen model. She found me and confessed everything to me, apparently, Gary promised to give her a big diamond watch. Worried this is a dishonored check? It's Saturday today and the banks are closed. I suggest you keep both the check and the watch, once the cheque is cashed on Monday, you can then deliver the watch to the girl. What do you say? No problem, I will deal with it. Come Monday, of course, the check bounced... Mr. Li, something is wrong with your check. What's the matter? Neither of us lost anything. I already got the girl last Saturday. Oh, thank you for your help. I've heard about his tricks to lure women into bed. But how could Leon take a photo of you cheating with someone else? - What are you talking about? - You were caught being all touchy with a salesman in a watch store. You were also caught giving him money. The salesman at the watch store is my old classmate. There's something I have to tell you, but I'm afraid you'll get really upset. I couldn't believe him. No wonder I kept seeing this fat guy when I was planning the wedding, Gary sent him. This is ridiculous! Please, for my sake, don't tell anyone. - Please? - No problem. But please buy this watch. It was you three, not Leng BingBing... - who made me want to run away. - Huh? I saw it in Gary's eyes... the night I introduced him to you gals. I knew, sooner or later, one of you would be his next goal. I couldn't accept the fact that he even wanted one of my closest friends. That man is helpless, and I was scared, I was so scared that one of you girls would fall for him. I didn't know what I would do then. - Why didn't you tell us? - Tell you? How? Should I have told you how I tolerated that bastard for however long? How could I be so stupid? I felt cheap. I knew you girls would yell at me. I have one last piece of proof if you still didn't believe me. - Honey, come to bed! - Don't rush - Quicker, quicker. - Quicker, quicker. - I can't wait, I can't wait. - Here I come! -Faster, faster -Where are you going? This is disgusting! If it were me, I would make sure he lost everything! Excuse me, where's the folder that I gave you? It's being delivered, it should be on its way now. Don't worry, Miss Wang, it will arrive on time. So, this is it? I'm getting divorced. I want to ask a favor. Sure. Do you mind going in front of the camera? Do you think you'll be the bride, in the end? I really need your help. Can you put the bouquet on the table? Thanks. Try something different. Can you listen to me now? If I do this, the TV station will never forgive me! It's a live broadcast, an incident like this will make you explode. - This is going to be an actual explosion. - Are you going to help me or not? - Yes! - Let's get working! I love to work! - What now? - Did you receive the...? The what? Oh, never mind. Hey! I honestly have no idea what you're saying. It doesn't matter. - I overreacted a bit the other day. - A bit? But I'm not going to apologize, because it's entirely your fault. My fault? Did you know that you look very sexy when you're concentrating? I love it when women concentrate. I couldn't control myself. Wow! That's what rapists usually say. - Wasn't it my beauty that attracted you? - You're very beautiful, but you're most beautiful when you're concentrating on your work. I thought we were working? Go! What are you looking at? Illustrations. My favorite. This artist is really something. YOU ARE A SHINING STAR I think you might like this book, but I'm not sure why this author calls himself the "White-Boned Demon." Do you know why? I bet you don't. It actually means a very outstanding white collar-worker. Everyone wants to be a white-boned demon when they first start working. You have to keep going, no matter what troubles you face. I've actually published a few illustrations, and my pseudonym is the White-Boned Demon. Shut up. Are you really the White-Boned Demon? No wonder I thought you would like this book. I hope everyone who suffers from a breakup can find themselves again through my illustrations. What about you? Are you looking for something? Me? Nothing. I see. But my friend's boyfriend is missing. Her boyfriend just left one day without saying anything. He only left a message. I'M BUSY. BYE-BYE. - I don't think he's ever coming back. - Why? If he was going to come back, he would have said, "See you." But not, "Bye-bye." But, because he's not coming back, he said, "Bye-bye." Crabs! Massive ones! For real! Why are there so many crabs? I just finished a piece of work, can I come to your room and show you? - May I use your laptop? - Sure. Come on in. Sit wherever you like. You should sit, too. Would you like some coffee? ROSA CHEN I'm a freelance photographer. You never told me. I'm not very good at it. It's okay. Thanks for the food and music the other night. No worries, as long as you liked it. - But I'm really mad now. - Please... Let me explain... How come you're so useless? You have no integrity! If you wanted to be someone's dog, then so be it, but I'm not interested - in becoming friends with people like you. - It's not like that. I don't think one cup of coffee will wake you up. Rosa, Rosa... It's bitter, I forgot to add sugar. Are you busy? It's almost done, you don't have to come check on me. I'm just looking around. What's wrong? Are you okay? Where are you? Don't be scared. Mom, where are you? I'm so scared. Where are you? Don't be scared, I'm here, okay? Please don't leave me. I won't. The fuse blew. I didn't make a backup! Don't worry, I remember where I stopped at, I'll sort it out tonight. - Are there any cups here? - No. You need two, right? Oh, no, what should we do? TOGETHER, FOREVER. Sorted! look how sweet! Is there something on my face again? I think you're really cute! Let's toast to it. Just one drink, then we'll get to work. Oh, no! - What? - Where are you? Come back soon, we need to prepare our plan. - You'd best be on your way. - One more thing, then. I'll go. I knew you received it. My earring went missing, and I couldn't find it in the trash... I can't find it, it's not here. ...but I found this letter in the trash room. Oh, wow and this came back to you. I guess this is fate. I just wanted to grab the flashlight. Please continue. Beautiful! Hey, hey, hey, I'm going to Gary's room, I'll be the first there. You girls come after ten minutes. Who is it? Aren't you going to invite me inside? I've thought about it... and I think I can choose again. I have to punish you. Let me... What's the rush? We've got the whole night. Oh? I can't wait to see what you have to offer! Ignore it. Answer the door first, maybe it's a surprise. Hello! - Are you surprised? - Are you happy? Are you nervous? What is the meaning of this? - The three of us have had our eye on you. - Really? We're going to let you choose, and we will be happy, whomever you choose. Really? Come on in. Wow, so crazy. I'm gonna hit you till you pee everywhere. What are you doing? Don't! - Come on, quick, quick, quick! - I'm scared of the pain, don't... - Who's the idiot? - You're the idiot! - Who's the idiot, you're still the idiot! - You're still the idiot! This plan is flawless. So, it's settled, everything will go according to plan! - In ten minutes... - We'll come to you. Oh, it's you! I'm sorry, I thought it was the groomsmen playing a prank on me. - Aren't you going to invite me inside? - Do come in, let me grab you a towel. Come in. Oh, sorry. So, here's the thing, I've thought about it, - and I think I can choose again. - Really? - I have to punish you. Let me... - What's the rush? We've got the whole night. Oh? I can't wait to see what you have to offer! - Go answer the door. - I'm so turned on right now! Ignore it. No, no, go answer the door. Maybe it's a surprise. Ignore them, you're my surprise. Then I'll get it. How come it's you? Bummer, I was just going to film Gary's embarrassing reaction and put it online. I'm leaving! Let me grab the towel... These groomsmen are such bastards. - Sewage problem? - Did you fall into the bathtub? - We're going to leave you two alone. - Hey, wait. Are you surprised? - Are you happy? - Are you nervous? - What is the meaning of this? - The three of us have had our eye on you. Really? So, we're going to let you choose. Let's go! So, this is what you're into? Wax play? Come, let me drip the wax on you. Wow, you like to play with whips. Come on, I'll whip you good. I whip people all the time! Do you like... Taking pictures? Taking selfies? I've taken so many, I have a huge collection. Come on, take your clothes off and I'll take some for you. - No, no! - Take them off! - No, no, let's not play games, okay? - Then what should we play? - Let's get down to business. - Go that way. - That way. - Okay, okay, come on. Oh, right, you still haven't chosen out of the three of us. - Do you want to try each one out first? - Yes. - You're so cute. - How about trying me out. Okay. I hurt myself while cycling two days ago, and it's still hurting. Sounds like they're having fun. Let's not bother them, let's go! This is tougher than fighting a war. It's tougher than giving birth. Thankfully, Jessie told us that Gary's really scared of blood. He fainted when he went to give blood in school, and people joked about it for five years. So a little blood pack on the thigh did the trick. - Well done! - Prince can't hear about this. Sean, neither! It's not what you think! It's not what you think either. So have we come to a decision? Who is it going to be? Me! There're three of you, but there's only one wedding dress. How about this? You all try the dress on. Whoever it fits is the bride. Come on, you first. Perfect. Don't stretch the dress, you're going to break it. - How about you try it? - Okay, coming. Quick, it's going to burst. It's fine, I can just stuff two oranges in there. With all this space, even stuffing two balloons in there wouldn't help. Why don't you try it? Please sign here. - It fits, she's the one. - You take care of this, I have to go greet the guests. Come on. Gary is shy. - Did you hear that, XiaoLuan? - Yes. All set here, I'm ready. Hello, let me introduce the wedding dress. The bride is wearing a low-cut design, which showcases her bosom. It's elegant without being slutty. The waist is also diamond-encrusted. This beautiful dress is brought to you by Agnes C, thank you very much. Also, all our angels are from Ladies of Paris Dance Production, who will be performing next month, and if you purchase tickets right here, right now, you'll get 20% off. How could you miss this great deal? Even I want to get some tickets! How much per ticket? The exciting moment is almost here! Please welcome Mr. Richard Billy Hunghun to witness the wedding. Our lawyer is sponsored by Hong Kong Law Firm. They charge 1388 dollars for wedding ceremonies, and only 1688 dollars for divorces. Please give them a call. You are so beautiful, even though I don't know you well, I will give you all the happiness. Bro, her father couldn't make it, so you will have to step in later. Thank you very much. The moment has arrived. Please give a round of applause for our male lead of tonight, the groom. You look very nice in this. I can't believe you're the one in this dress in the end. Do you really want to marry Gary? I thought this was what you wanted? Ladies and gentlemen, the moment you've been waiting for... - Come with me. - ...please give a big round of applause to welcome our bride! As the bride's father could not make it to the wedding, one of the groomsmen has stepped in to give her away. What's even more special is the red carpet they are walking on, - which is sponsored by Persian Carpet. - What's all this product placement? Pull the camera away, show the carpet. There's still time if you come with me now. I think Gary is actually quite nice. You just want to get revenge on your ex-boyfriend? He's not going to come back because of this. It doesn't matter, I'll have a husband soon. Gary is just a sweet talker. He is completely dead inside. It doesn't matter, as long as he marries me. Don't marry him, marry me. I know you don't want others to think that you're unwanted and lonely but you're not, because I'm right next to you. You mean, you're right next to Gary, and you helped him to get me. - What are you two doing? - Do you have to rush into this? I think all you want is to marry into a rich family and depend on them for the rest of your life. You freak. You weirdo. You're cheapening yourself, you know? You have no shame! Aren't you just his dog? So what if I'm his dog, you're a chicken who is dying to get married! And Gary is a wolf. Well then, you're going to give this chicken away to the wolf. See you. Wow. Surely the groomsmen are off to prepare something special. Let us continue, here's our bride. Look at them, what a lovely couple. They are meant for each other. We are running out of time, we have to get going. Gary Li, will you take Rosa Chen to be your lawfully wedded wife, to have and to hold, from this day forward, for better, for worse, for richer, for poorer, in sickness and in health, - until death do you part? - I do. A round of applause. Rosa Chen, will you take Gary Li to be your lawfully wedded husband, to have and to hold, from this day forward, for better, for worse, for richer, for poorer, in sickness and in health, until death do you part? I'm asking the bride... Yeah I'm asking you. Answer me, don't just stand there smiling. Answer me, quickly. We have to go to a commercial on our online broadcast. Come on, answer me. That's right. Why don't you all make this decision for me! - What does that mean? - Coming. - Is this part of it? - This is disgusting! Hey, you're in trouble. Don't look. - Sick bastard. - Wait, wait, wait... No wonder we have a runaway bride. It's like an enoki mushroom, even though he's hard. BOSS I'm assuming I'll get a raise, now that I'm sort of a celebrity? Hey! Don't go! Give me back my money! This is tragic! Oh, hey, since everyone's here, let's do a joint wedding-birthday celebration. Coincidentally, it's my birthday, so why not give me some red pockets, huh? I'm coming down to collect them. Hey, don't go, sir. Enoki mushroom! Hey, be careful. You really have changed! You used to get really nervous when you saw a tiny wrinkle on your face, but look at your now, laughing so hard that you look practically deformed. I think it's best to just be yourself. You can't think too much about what others say. You and that director, when did it happen? - Tell us. - I want to know, too. Come on. My dear gals, I heard you did something crazy and it has over 50 million views online. That's marvelous! My darling and I have a little miracle on the way! Don't misunderstand me, I mean he is going to choreograph a routine based on Rosa's story online. What great weather. Thanks for helping out. Why are you so happy, I heard you got fired? Oh, that's okay, I saw it coming. I'm so sorry for dragging you down. I chose to do it. I have to take responsibility for myself. This again. Why don't you become a dancer? Well, just because I like art doesn't mean I have to be an artist. This is just how I make a living, and I have to do this. So, what's next for you? Would you ever want to film a documentary with me? It's tough work. Filming in the wild, a lot of heavy lifting... - You think I'm scared? - No change of clothes and no makeup. I'm a natural beauty, I look stunning without makeup. You're in! I wonder if you'll be the person who covers me with the shirt? Or the person who digs a hole and buries me. What? Nothing. When we perform it, I really want to invite you gals to see it at the theater. I've found my dream here. I'm sorry for overreacting, I didn't mean what I said. So you didn't mean it when you said you'd marry me? That, I meant. I meant that. I'm forever grateful to Gary, but I'm not his dog, I'm his bro. Just kidding. And I'm not a chicken dying to get married. - Let's make peace. - Absolutely. - Also, you can't say "bye-bye" to me. - And you can't say "see you" to me. I just saw a crab crawling into your dress. Where? Just kidding. How's your hand? It's all right, just a little dislocated. Let's not talk so much. - Why do we have to kiss? - I've thought about it. Whatever. Hey! What's on the other side, man? - There's no other side. - Really? That's great. Hey, sir! What are you doing? I've got too many problems, just want to have a soak. You'll eventually let go when you're in pain. Welcome to today's Culture Square. Congratulations, Rosa Chen. Your new book, "Say Goodbye to Bye-Bye, Fall in Love with See You" Sounds rather mysterious. Could you tell me more about it? I'M BUSY. BYE-BYE. See you. Actually "bye-bye" and "see you" represent men's two different views on love. So which kind of man have you met recently? Neither. Just kidding. I think I'm very lucky. Someone once said, getting married is like getting an empty suitcase. Whatever you put inside today, you'll take out the same thing years later. You put care, trust, understanding and forgiveness into the case, and that's what you'll take out of the suitcase years later. If you put betrayal and mistrust into that suitcase, then it is betrayal and mistrust that you will take out of it years later. So, what exactly did LiLei and I put into that case? Why am I with this man? Because going after looks won't make me happy, but the way he lives his life so practically makes me feel very secure. Wow, so sweet!
