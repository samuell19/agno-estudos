Anything for you? -Hot chocolate, please. -It has run out. And when will it be back? -It's up to you. -What do you mean? The day of chocolate... We're almost there, Monika. -It really is far away. -Far away from what, darling? -From everything. -You'll get used to it. Look, it's your new school. Why do we have to live in the middle of nowhere? A change will be good for you. It's unfair that I got my first flowers as a farewell gift. Sweetheart, flowers are given for all sorts of occasions. Anyway, it's your birthday soon. Do you need help with unpacking or you'll do it by yourself? By myself. Aren't you cold? You are odd yourself. It's not what I've said. I know what you've said and what you've thought! What have I thought? No, no, no... Monika! Hi. This is my room. There's only our attic. You can't go up there. -You know how to fold an umbrella? -I don't know... Do you live with your Mum only? -You don't have a dad? -I do, but he doesn't live with us now. He says he needs time. -What for? -I don't know. He might come back soon. Don't touch it! Mum, could she go now? I wish I could tell someone about you. Just as a test. Your Mum doesn't know? -What about? -About the she-cat. You've sneaked it out, so she doesn't know. How do you know it's a she-cat? A cat with three colours on its fur is a girl. There's your Mum. I'm under close surveillance. -Why? -They're afraid I might leave. Where? This is where my Grandma lives. She's a hula dancer too. Does your Grandma live in Hawaii? I'll soon visit her. On your own? On my own. And your parents will let you go? I never ask them for permission. -I've already gone to the airport once. -And? Next time, I'll go by ship. You have just come here. Don't you like this place? I do. But I miss my Grandma. What year is it? Chocolate... I want chocolate... Chocolate... I want chocolate. He woke up. I want chocolate! And he'll keep bugging for chocolate again. I want chocolate! I want chocolate! It has started again. I want chocolate! You know nothing about me! Go away! But I live here. So find yourself another clock. Why, huh? -Because I'm going to tell Mum. -She won't believe you. -Mum! -Shh! You're scaring me. Give me the cuckoo back. No way! You won't get the bird. It helps me count the time I can't hop over. Who are you? I'm nobody without chocolate. Bring me some and I'll tell you about myself. Off you go! Just don't tell anyone about me! Go! School is not a circus, sweetheart. Why can't you dress like your friends? -I'm sure everyone laughs at you. -No, they don't! They must be laughing behind your back. How do you know this? Because normal people don't wear such clothes! It's a hula dancer skirt. You know nothing. School is for learning, not for dancing. Don't be angry with me. Dressing up won't bring Grandma back. -Sweetheart... -I'm done talking to you! What happened? It's time she stopped wearing that skirt. -Come on. -She really wants to go there. You could at least unpack. Monika, a runaway... I'll have to arrest you again. You know that, don't you? It's the third time this month. -Why are you biting your uncle? -Monika! No respect for the uniform. -Till next time... -Thanks, brother. -You ran away again. -I went away. But why? We have a new home. You haven't even unpacked... I don't want to. I want to visit Grandma. In Hawaii? She's not there. Yes, she is. We have a surprise for you. Instead of freezing in the winter here, we could go to Hawaii. You'll see what the place is like. You'll learn the real hula dance... -I'm sure you'll love it. -You know nothing about me! -'Grandma's gone to Hawaii.' Brilliant! -I know it was a bad idea. -So why didn't we tell her the truth? -She'll grow out of it. When? -What if she runs away again? -She won't. -She's made a new friend. -Uh-huh. I was told about this therapist. She makes home visits on Mondays. Do you want her to forget Grandma? What a brave boy! I'm going away soon. Stay a bit longer. I have no time. I must escape from the Witch. They want me to forget Grandma. That's why they hired her. She's meant to cast a spell on me. -Can I go with you? -I'll think about it. Do you think she flies on a broom? A nice motorbike, isn't it? Can I get you something to drink? Hot chocolate? I'm allergic to chocolate. Just a cup of coffee, please. Let's talk about Monika. Yes... It would be good if you cheered her up a bit. A child of her age shouldn't live on memories. -Here you are. -Thank you. I like my coffee sweet. You should know our daughter is afraid of you. She made up some story. She has a vivid imagination. That's good, don't you think? Children should have a vivid imagination. Run away... Run away... Run away! Will you run away with me? -Where are you off to? -We're running away. Come back for lunch, will you? Has anyone been following you? -I don't know. -That's not good. -Do you think she flies on a broom? -The Witch? Zuzia drowned in this river. Are you sad? I'm just trying to get by. -Why aren't you eating? -I'm saving the food for later. There you are! Why are you looking at me like that? I'm a runaway too. You're taking us back, right? -Your Mum's worried about you. -You've ruined everything. Who would you like to be if you weren't yourself? Choc-o-late! Chocolate! I want chocolate! Something tells me you're not an ordinary cat... Are you, Zuzia? Who would you like to be if you weren't yourself? I don't know. -I'd like to be a grown-up. -I wouldn't. Zuzia wanted to be a cat. Zuzia? My sister. I wish I had met her. Would you like to? This is my sister Zuzia. Zuzia, this is Monika. How do you know this is your sister? If it were your sister, you'd recognize her too. -You're probably right. -I like her as a cat. But it's not the same. We used to have the Day of Chocolate. It's not possible now... Our parents did it for her. They've forgotten about me a bit. -I wish I understood her. -She says she's happy. Do you understand what she says? Zuzia, do you remember me? Can you translate it for me? Of course she does, she says. She's your sister after all. But she'd like you to give her warmer milk. Anything you want, Zuzia. I've been waiting for you. Your room is locked. I want to turn back time. Happy birthday, sweetheart. May your life be full of health, happiness, smiles and friends... And may you never run away again. It's for you. Monika! Put this on. But it's shallow here. Please do it for me. I want to be a grown-up. The older I get, the more problems I have. If I were a grown-up, I wouldn't let the Witch into our house. Maybe she's not as scary as she looks. I mean... Maybe she doesn't look as scary as we think she does. My Mum says she's a therapist, not a witch. -But I'm not lying. -Yeah, sure. You'd better come up with an idea how to turn me into a grown-up. By Monday. And that's final! I'll ask Mum. She's good at it. Why don't you ask Dad? He should know. It's me, Dad. Will you come over? Please come over. Mum's getting bored without you. Dawid, can you help me, please? Dad... What should you do to become a grown-up? No need to hurry. It just happens. What if someone can't wait? You have to get a job... Find your other half, get married and take care of her. And be responsible for her. Yes, you need a home and family. But you have a family. Then why aren't you living with us? It's Zuzia's fault. I don't know what's wrong. She won't leave the attic. What is she saying? The Witch's bat was flying over our houses last night. Does she have a bat? -Are you saying Zuzia is lying? -No! You should have protected us. I would have, but I didn't hear anything. You were asleep. I must become a grown-up or the Witch will erase all my memories about Grandma. She might erase you too. Me? Zuzia says you're hiding something from me. Dawid, only you can save me from the Witch. There's a tunnel in the clock. I've been there. -Why didn't you tell me? -Because I don't want to go back there. Some weirdo lives there. I feed him chocolate, but he's still very wild. Will you find him? He might help me grow old. You should take care of me now. I will. Anything for you? -Hot chocolate, please. -It has run out. And when will it be back? -It's up to you. -What do you mean? The Day of Chocolate... For now, we only have weekdays. The Devourer of Mondays will be happy to share. Enjoy your meal. Are you mocking me? The beginning of the week. I wonder if anyone likes Mondays anymore. You are the Devourer of Mondays? Could you devour this Monday? No. I devour only the time that has passed. Mondays upset my stomach. I asked for a transfer a long time ago. -What can I possibly do about it? -You can throw it away. What a great idea! A few Monday hours in the dustbin. Time has its value, my friend. Off you go! There has to be a way. Or this Monday will be inedible. The Witch is coming. There's one man. His name is the Time Hopper. I think I know who that is. Are we going to have the Day of Chocolate or not? You are the Time Hopper? And why is that? You want me to take you 100 years into the future? The conquest of space... 500 years? The civilization of robots. Maybe one million years? Any time but the past because that time is gone. Monika wants to be old. Can you arrange this? Maybe I can. But not without chocolate. What's that got to do with it? I'm not myself without it. I need chocolate for time hopping. This can be done. -So you will grow old together? -I guess so. -Won't you regret it? -I don't know. -You will lose Zuzia. -No, I won't! Yes, you will. Cats live shorter than men. She'll be gone in twenty years. Think about it. What do you really want? I want to turn back time and never let Zuzia go. I'm afraid that's impossible. The time that has passed was eaten at last! I'd feel terrible if you left me again. Where are you going? Don't go too far. Zuzia! Why did you name the cat Zuzia? A cat with three colours on its fur is a girl. You know? -A girl? -I mean a she-cat. You mustn't call her that. You hear me? Zuzia! Zuzia! Zuzia! Why are you following me? I want to be alone! I'll visit you anyway. Dawid, you promised me something. Well, I've been thinking... I don't want to get old. I've spoken to Zuzia. She'll grow old with me. You're lying. She didn't say that. She's staying with me. She'll do what she wants. If she were your sister, you wouldn't say that. She's my friend. I like her. And she says she likes me too. I won't let you do this! Why won't you let me up? I just want to talk to him. She says you should leave her alone. No, she doesn't. Stop tugging her! Dawid, come down for a minute. Your Mum's calling you. Ma'am, he doesn't want to. Dawid! What's wrong, son? Do you want me to sit there with you? It's late. Monika. Hello? What? I don't want to talk to you now. The Day of the Witch... I'll visit you anyway. Are you running away? Please stay! You can join me if you want. Actually, you should. My Mum told you to watch over me. I don't work for her anymore. Then prove it and come with me. I'm not allowed to take a bus on my own. Can't we go to the river? Is Monika here? -Hello, do you remember me? -You are the Witch. And you're a smart boy. Monika was seen getting off at the next stop. This means she isn't far. You'd tell me if you knew where she is? We want to help her. You don't get it. It's all your fault. I'm so happy you're here. Will you tell me a story? Once upon a time, when I was your age, I also loved a girl who lived next door. But she didn't notice me. I did everything for her. But she didn't know that. What was her name? Krystynka. Just like Mum's. You could stay here for good. I guess so. Then just stay. They've stolen our house. I rented it out to them. Sweet dreams. -Goodnight. -Goodnight. It's time to take care of your Grandma, little dancer. Dawid? Wait for me. Monika, run away! The Witch is out there. We must run! Shh! She'll hear us! I'm the Time Hopper. I was going to make you old. She's got Dawid. No hope for a romantic time hop? -Got any spare chocolate? -Only if you help me. -But I need it. -I need it too. I'd help you, but... I have no time now! It's so sweet of you to bring him here. What have you done to him? This boy has something special. Something I can't get even from you. Dawid! We have to get out of here! Leave him alone! I was the one you hunted for. -Let him go. -Of course I will. As soon as I get his most precious thing. I especially like memories about little girls. Your Grandma is fine, but Dawid's memory... Zuzia will be the pride of my collection. Now, go ahead! You can take him! You steal our memories because you have none of your own? Memories... Who needs them anyway? It's time to take care of your Grandma, little dancer. An espresso for you, ma'am. Seven sugar cubes, as you like it. -Are you plotting something? -Am I plotting something? Yes. Aren't you plotting anything? No, I'm not. Didn't you try to... ...poison me with chocolate? Be good now. Stop resisting. Will you take the spell off him when I give you Grandma? Believe me, it's better to forget. You'll no longer miss her. You won't have to run away. -What are you doing? -I'm giving you a memory. Your own pleasant memory. -I'm an evil witch. No one hugs me. -Grandma used to do that. When I was angry, she gave me a hug. I almost forgot about it. You're traveling alone? Without your parents? Where are your parents? Are you lost? You ran away from home. Look at this! My niece's husband. Thank you for your public spirit. I'm taking over the fugitive. I hope that at least you don't bite? It's good to see you, but I can't go back home. And why is that? Will you help me or not? Something happened? Romeo asks for a short talk. Are you really the Witch? So, it doesn't look that bad. There's nothing to worry about. Monika! Come and say goodbye. You know, I sometimes feel like a witch. I'm not going to visit you unless you want me to. -Goodbye. -Goodbye. I don't get you. I'd love to meet this pretty lady again. I have a Harley too. The Day of Chocolate... It's even nice here. A place with food for thought. Monika? Are you there? Maybe the spell has been taken off? Are you sure the Witch cast a spell on us? We can stay here longer. I don't know about you, but I already miss you! Zuzia liked cornflakes and milk too. Do you remember, Mum? Just like these. You could at least say hello to Mum. We could have the Day of Chocolate, like we used to do with Zuzia. Children! The Day of Chocolate! -Chocolate! -Dad! -Dawid! -Just in time. -The Day of Chocolate... -The Day of Chocolate! I'm so happy to see you. Stop nibbling! Everyone has got memories. Those of our beloved are the most precious ones. We should treat them with great care because they are very fragile. A bit like butterflies. You can't turn back time. You can only eat it.
