- How are things? - Evening. You okay? He's not picking up, damn it! - Are you ready? - For what? The heist of our life, and you ask me for what? Asshole, I'm ready, I thought you meant something else. And you can think of something else? Is this any time to be bullshitting around? - What if we swap roles? - Are you crazy? I'll snatch the bags with the money, I'm scared I'll mess up with the gun. It's a dud, and you've been rehearsing for days! Stop making me anxious! He's still not picking up! Where the fuck are you? They're here, it's time! What a retard! I'll show him! - Watch where you're fuckin' going! - I only touched you. A WEEK BEFORE - Touched me? - Yes. - Who gave you a license? - Who said I have one? - Oh, very witty… - Listen who's talking! Get out of here! - Calm down. - Look what you've done to my car. Look what you've done to mine! You ran into me. Get out of here! - Here will do. Thanks, Domenico. - No problem. Hi. - Hurry up, get rid of those. - Where are we going? Am I dressed right? My friend's son needs private lessons, 20 euros an hour. What kind of lessons? - Mauretto, school stuff. You were good. - What subject? Wait a sec. Let's grab a coffee. A barley coffee, please. - Is there a toilet here? - Down the steps, at the bottom. - It's engaged. - Thanks. - Do you want a coffee? - No. Thanks. Did you have to get me one of these? - You played your cards badly. - Not again! You could have improvised. He needed Greek lessons. I'm a surveyor, how can I improvise? Warn me next time, then we won't look like idiots. And I an asshole. Are you still looking? They'll never reply. Sooner or later they will. I hate this postman. She's dead, but it happened so suddenly, no one knew she was going to die. We still think of her as alive. So… will she get her pension or not? R11, I've told you. R11, yes. - I'll hang on. - Dad, cut us some slack today. Oh yeah! Who'll pay the rent without Grandma's pension? Hello? Okay. Not today, eh? Not today of all days! Press? One. Without hanging up? Okay. - Leave him alone, calm down. - I am calm. Would you believe it? "Press 1…" If I have another girl, I'll call her Giulia, like Grandma. How much did she give you? - Two hundred euros. - Two hundred euros? - Forget about it. - What do I do now? - You'll cope… listen to this ruckus! - Calm down, Romolo, just leave it. Take your drops and calm down, just leave it! Open the door! This is my home! Get out of my home, open the door! Is everything okay? Everything's fine. - You broke my nose. - Good evening. Good evening. Come on, Sam, you didn't speak a word of Italian when we first met. Cut this out, play with me. How do you say "I love you" in your language? Don't talk crap, you told me once. How do you say it? Calm down, Lucia! Cut it out! Can't you knock first? - What are you doing? - I was thinking about Grandma. When she was young… I'm going for a smoke. Will you lose the deposit too? Lucia was looking forward to it, an apartment of our own… She'll get over it. I won't, Mauretto. I'm sick to hell. That makes two of us… Let's get some sleep, we've a hard day ahead. Goodnight. I'M SORRY TO HEAR ABOUT YOUR GRANDMA, MY LOVE YOU'RE IN MY HEART, I LOVE YOU SO MUCH - Thank you. - Goodbye. Does it look wet? Because if I ask you for something, you have to give it to me, okay? The instructions say "Shake well before use and apply on wet hair". And what do you think I did? Okay, I'll tell you what… - Try this one. - You're exchanging it then? - No, the product's been opened. - Of course, how stupid of me! We can all do that! You can shut up shop for all I care! - What are you doing? - Sorry, there's a funeral procession. Did we have to have this procession? I don't mean for Grandma, but everyone's staring at us. - That thief even crossed himself! - Not today, Guglielmo. Look at him… just look at his face! That's enough… - I'll get out and punch him. - Guglielmo! Open this shutter! Retard! Uncle, has city hall said anything yet? No? I sent in my application, but I've had no reply. - What can I do about it? - Call your friend. Okay… Make sure you paste them up. Because I'll do the rounds, and if I catch you, there'll be fucking trouble. Bit late, aren't we? I was at my grandma's funeral. Well, jump to it. Come on, get on with it, out of my way! The same crap song every day! The same one every day. - Attorney, my rights aren't protected. - Hear that? His rights aren't protected! You have a fuckin' cheek! I'm losing customers because they don't want to hear this ruckus, and that's why I don't have my rent. Understand? These little sluts are driving me crazy! - I'll kill this swine! - No! Please, Guglielmo, hit him and you'll be in the wrong. Did you hear what he said? He wants a refund! He's been here a year and hasn't paid me in nine months! It's a crap shop! And you're busting my balls too, turn that garbage off! Guglielmo, please, you're only going to make matters worse. The attorney's right. - Just calm down. - Calm down? I fuckin' won't calm down! Let's go. It took me 50 years to buy this shop. First they make me retire because the law has changed, then I have to pay taxes, but I can't work, and now this bastard is not paying his rent and I can't evict him, how does that work, eh? I know, Guglielmo. But place your trust in the law… Yeah, sure… - Liun! - It's nearly ready. Bring me the ones you've already done. Turn your brain on before you kill someone. Come on! Pick them up later. C'mon. You've got to focus. I'm sorry about your grandma, Romolo. How much does that little car you have cost? Tell your friend they don't pay us overtime here. Get back to work. Go on! Times are hard, they're really hard… - I'll give you 40 next time. - But I need it now. Let's just say you did me a favor this time. It was no favor, Jackal! Give us our 20 euros! - I wasn't talking to you. - We'll tell the cops. The posters had no tax stamp. - What about it? - They're illegal. Don't you know they're for the electoral campaign? They've never been legal, bright guy… We'll report you. We work off the books, so we can report you. Fancy yourself as a trade unionist, eh? We're not going to argue over a few euros, are we? - Right. - What a wicked world this is… - For you. - And for you. - You did stick them up? - Yeah. - I'll do the rounds, you know. - Go ahead. Melone, get off home! Or did you hope to eat at my place? Come on! Mommy… Hi, Romolo, look what your mom's making. - Hi, Ma. - Hi, honey. - This is for you. - Thanks. I won 20 euros, you have it. - Did you call the doctor? - No doctor. They're considered beauty treatments, too expensive. But you can hardly walk. - What's he doing? - Dunno, he's been at it some time. Dad! - What are you doing? - I want to see what's there. - That's Ferri's apartment. - I want to see what room it is. The place has been shut down for two years, what's it to him if we use one of his rooms? - You don't really mean that? - Yes, it might even be furnished. I'll be an asshole this time! Dad, stop it! You're losing it, what's wrong with you? If he won't let me into the shop, I'll blow his head off. I'll grab my rifle and tomorrow I'll blow his head off! That won't help! You have to calm down. What the fuck are you saying? Listen who's talking! You'd have beaten the fucking life out of him, you would! What the fuck are you saying? Get off the bed. Let me clean up. I'll do it, call your mother. Look what you've fuckin' done! - We need to talk. - About what? About what? The apartment. Not your mother then? I've got two tickets, it's her only diversion, she never leaves the house. Everything counts here. What can I say about the apartment? Your mind's made up. What else can I do? Lucia… Don't you think I want our own place too? Yes, I know that. But I don't know how long I can hold out. Why don't we buy that machine thing you showed me? Which one? The one for doing nails. You were good at that, you had loads of clients before the baby arrived. I needed our own place for that. Do I work out on the street? Or with your mom soaking her feet and your dad yelling? You tell me what I'm supposed to do. Do I start stealing again? Maria, is dinner ready? It's been ready ages. Is Mauro not coming? You don't know. No one knows anything here. Daddy? Hello, Ciro, good evening. - Can I have a word? - Of course, Mauretto. Go ahead, say what you want, we're equal partners. Why don't you pay Dad the rent? Go inside. Is that any way to talk in front of a kid? - You do know how business is here? - No, tell me. Bad, or rather, very bad. I screwed up when I took on this place. If it carries on like this, I'll have to shut up the shop. Let's find a solution. Can you give him some? I don't mean all of it, but… You haven't paid him for a year, it's affecting Dad's health. You do know he grabbed hold of me today? - He should be grateful I don't report him. - Dad? Don't be silly. He's 80, he's never harmed a fly, he's the kindest person in the world. I've come to work out some solution, an agreement. But it seems I'm wasting my time and Dad's right, you're a crook. How dare you! You come here, to my shop, and in front of my kid you treat me like an asshole? Get out of here! Put that in there. - Were you really about to hit him? - Yes, what about it? Tough guy! - How's it going with the old guy? - He's not old. Yeah, right. Are you getting married? Not straight away. I'll make him wait. Make him wait a bit longer and he'll die of old age. Are you jealous? You looked stressed out, you need a holiday. I'm broke, I can't afford one. Find a wealthy woman, then you can help your dad out. Listen, is this Juliette Lewis singing? - No, it's not her. - Yes, it is! - She's a hot chick. - Don't be silly! - She's so hot. - Only you think so, she's skinny. Remember when she came to play at the Alpheus? And you wouldn't let me go because you were jealous? I'd even bought a ticket, 28 euros… - Money down the drain. - Yeah, sure. They were good times. Well… what's up? What's up? Since we split up, you've become even prettier. Do you fancy a screw? What? - Do you fancy making love? - No. - Why not? - Because I say not. We've done it a thousand times. What's the difference? It is different, I have a boyfriend. But I'll give you a hand job. Do you really mean that? Close the door. - Get on top. - No. - Why not? - It'd be cheating, I'm respectable. Can I have a cigarette? HEROIN ADDICT RUNS OVER MOTHER AND DAUGHTER LOOKING FOR THE HIT-AND-RUN DRIVER SPOTTED AT 11:25 AM Isn't it a bit early? I'm seeing the psychologist. Go back to sleep. Jesus… Ouch! What the fuck… - Are you crazy? - Sneaking in like a thief? They're Mom's keys, I was trying not to wake anyone. That's right, everyone's asleep! You gave me a fright! - I thought you threw that away. - You haven't seen it. Turn the coffee off. - Dickhead! - That too? It's Mauro, go back to sleep. This… Ouch! Where did you get to? I went out. With Samantha. What an asshole. She ditches you for an old guy, yet you still run after her. You know what? She did the right thing. The right thing? Yes, look how we live, look how I live. Why does she have to leave these on the table? I've had enough, Romolo. Something has to change, I need to hit lucky. Hit lucky? How? I don't know, a scam, a ploy, I'll think of something. - A scam? You? - Why not? Remember the first time the cops came for me? Of course. You were 15 and you burst out crying. I thought they'd come for me. For a couple of CDs, you'd copied to sell at school… - And he wants to hit lucky… - Yes. Do you want a little job? - Yes. - Go to bed. What else can I do? What can you do? Are you serious? Two robberies, you almost killed a man, four years in jail, and now that you seem so strong and settled, after all the work we've done, you say: "What else can I do?" You can't expect to solve the world's problems. Think of yourself. I understand your worries, your anxiety, but you have to think of your own life, about what you need. Let other people make their own decisions, you can't take that on. In fact, you know what? You have to be more selfish. I'm not sure I can. - What does that mean? - I don't know. I don't know. I didn't need these before. Do you think you're the only one with problems? Romolo, we have a choice, you made the right choice. Some time ago. Don't let me down. I have to get to work. - Thanks, doctor. - Bye. - Who is it? - Ma'am… Who is it? Hey, Mauro! - Why aren't you answering? - I was asleep. Is your brother home? - Why? - I want to talk to him. Wait, I'll come down. Why won't you tell me what you want him for? I need some advice. - Advice, from Romolo? - Yes. About what? I bumped into Samantha with this old guy, a good-looking man. - I'd underestimated him. - Asshole. - Will you tell me? - Here's your coffee. Decaf… - Laced. - Thanks. Well? I want to carry out a robbery. - Did you wake me to bullshit me? - Rob the Chinese. The Chinese? Remember when you went to see about private lessons? - Well? - I found some Chinese. They have a money-lending racket, I know all about it. It's a clean job. A clean job? Just listen to you! Are you crazy? - I came as quick as I could. - Hi. Hi, Domenico. What did you want me for? Tell him. He's planning a robbery. - See you around, guys. - Sit down. - There are three of them. - Who? The Chinese! They're loaded, Fabio, they take them there themselves. But we have to catch them off guard. They arrive, we turn up and they're not expecting us. Arrive where? What the fuck? You watch too many films, they'll beat us up. That's why I wanted Romolo. - It's raining! - Good morning, two espressos, please. And now the cops. I want nothing to do with it and don't you dare drag Romolo into it. Pay the bill. You're a piece of shit! - Mauretto. - What is this stuff? Nothing, never you mind. I've already told your father. You can't go in there. What have you done, you bastard? What have you done? You bastard! I'll kill you! I'll kill you, you bastard! I'll kill you. How you doing? - Grandma's died. - I'm sorry. What did you want? - I'm worried about Mauro. - What's wrong? What's wrong… He needs a job. It's a bad moment, there are already too many of us. And the trade unions are breathing down our necks… But we have to find a solution for Mauro. Maybe we can solve your problem, and mine. Come here. That guy there… what the fuck is he doing here? Stealing work from Italians? You work alongside him every day, right? There you go. All I need is for him to screw up. Even slightly… Thanks, Francesco. But never mind. I'll think of something else. Assault? Inspector, you must be mistaken! Perhaps you mean Romolo, my other son. Who reported him? Is Mauro Borri here or not? Fuck… That's enough! That's enough of that torment, you've busted my balls! I've had enough. Are you sure you're not looking for Romolo Borri? Not again… Madam, how many times do I have to tell you? What will you do to him? The usual procedure, I'll ask him a few questions. What do you expect us to do to the boy? Shall I make you a nice coffee? I can make a coffee! My foot hurts. Mom, I can't hear you! I can't hear you! Wait a sec! I can't hear you, wait! What's up? Who? Mauro? That's nonsense! Mom, just calm down, don't get upset. He's not vanished… I'll find him, don't worry. I'll call you back. I'll call you back. Bye. Listen… how come your brother hasn't turned up for work? Rinse your mouth out when you talk about Mauro. Geez, you're so gross! - Armando, have you seen Mauro? - He called in this morning. Romolo! - Well? - Well what? - Didn't Mauro tell you? - Do you know where he is? - No, is anything wrong? - No, everything's fine. What? We wanted to talk to you about something. Have you got a minute? - Yes? - Do you know where Mauretto is? No, why? Has something happened? This is a free message… You're in a fine state… I'm looking for Mauretto. Have you seen him? I don't think so. How come? You're always out and about. You know everyone's business. Even if I knew, why should I tell you? - To even things out? - To even things out? When I caught you, I was only doing my job. And now you're a madman. He'll call by sooner or later. Let's say I haven't seen you. What the fuck… You scared me. Have you seen this? The son of a bitch. If Dad sees this, he'll have a heart attack. - He'd better not see it. - How do we do that? Mom's worried. - I don't know what came over me. - Why, did you do it? - Yes. - You beat him up? Yes, I even hurt my hand. What are you laughing at? This is serious. What do I do now? So you admit you beat De Gregorio up? Yes. Yesterday afternoon, according to the statement, you hit him first in the face, then smashed his head on the sidewalk. But he attacked me first, quite violently. If you knew the police were out looking for you, why didn't you contact us before now? I was scared. I've never been attacked before. Why did he do it? Because I caught him stealing from my father's shop. What was there to steal? It was his shop. The radiators, the tiles, the shelves, the taps, he stole it all. When I got there, he was taking two radiators away. So… Caught red-handed, De Gregorio is supposed to have attacked you. Not "supposed to", he did. And don't you find that overreacting? - What can I say? - There's something not right here. - You have a clean record. - Right. You're a respectable person, you have qualifications, you've applied for a job, as a postman… - Not as a postman. - Whatever… It's strange that a respectable person like you, would beat up a person like De Gregorio with such violence. I was desperate, I lost my head. I'm only trying to help you, to work out if you really did it on your own. Or if someone… with a police record… a friend, member of the family… No, don't try that. Don't drag my brother into this, he had nothing to do with it. If you want the truth, if someone gave me a hand, it's you in the police, for a year… we've been telling you he steals from us, yet you did nothing. Of course you lose your temper. Have I finished here? - Can I go? - Yes, but stick around. Goodbye. Hey. Hey, dad. It's all sorted, don't worry. Your mother rang, the bailiff has arrived. - So? - We'll get the shop back tomorrow. Let's go home and celebrate. You're learning how it's done, eh? Let's send the Chinese guy home. Well done, let me give you a hug. I'll wait for your report. - Hey. - Hey. - Why have you come? - Where were you? - I phoned you loads of times. - Are you jealous? Pick up when I call you. - You're jealous! - Cut it out. You're needed. - I don't believe it. - You just don't understand. - And you understand everything? - More or less. The boss asked me if you're free, so be at the ready. We won't tell Mom and Dad yet. - I'm not staying for dinner. - Where are you going? To let someone take the piss. Hi, honey. See if it fits you. It'll be fine. - Sorry, my hands are dirty. - Don't worry. - There you go. - Yes. It fits. So you're Cinderella then! That's right! Nice! I feel a different woman. So I'll go dancing with another woman tonight? You got any cigarettes? On the bedside table. Can you close the door? He's making himself pretty! You don't know what you're missing, it's delicious. You eat like a horse! You're like a bottomless pit, where do you put it all? - Want some? - No. Why did you dump me? - Because you're boring. - Me? You always have pizza with mushrooms. You never surprise me, you never improvise. Is that all? If that's all it was, maybe that means… you're still a little in love with me. Maybe. I want you so much! Wait, wait… Is the doctor here? Samantha, is the doctor here? - No, it's just I feel all… - I too feel all… Darn it, tonight of all nights. How do you feel? - The toilet paper. - What? - The toilet paper. - The toilet paper? Here. Are you okay? Feeling better? A little. You look beautiful even when you're being sick… You're so beautiful. Will you make me a hot lemon? Yes. It'll make you feel better. - Careful, it's hot. - Thanks. Is that the doctor? He likes the sea, eh? Is this Circeo? I recognize it, I've been there too. It's the Bahamas. Look how he's furnished this place! It's really… how do I put it? I mean, look at the color of that wall! I chose it. Really? Why don't you keep quiet? Come here. This hot lemon's good. I miss you so much. I can take you to the Bahamas too. Okay? Are you feeling sick again? - What's up? - I'll go and brush my teeth. We'll do it. - What? - The robbery, we'll do it. - Are you serious? - What the fuck are you saying? Are you shitting your pants? - I'll do it myself otherwise. - Are you crazy? - You want to rob the Chinese? - Yes. We're not doing anything without Romolo, understand? - Did he hear that? - No, he's only a kid. - We'll have to get rid of him. - Go fuck yourself! Keep still, you dickheads! Stay there, don't move! What the fuck's going on? Guys, the money! Grab the money! What are they doing? What the…? They're leaving already? Follow them. Get out of the car, you bastard! Yes… we'll sort this out. - Stand over here. - We'll sort it out. - We'll sort it out. - Get down on your knees. What the fuck are you staring at? Eyes down! Don't look at me! - Don't look at me! - Mauretto… Have you gone crazy? Throw those bags down and go home. Fuck! Let me think. If that dickhead brother of yours was unable to pull this off, how could you with this pair of retards? You shit! Rinse your mouth out when talking about my brother! What the fuck are you doing? Let's go. I smashed that bastard's face in. And if he goes to the police, we'll all be in the shit. Who cares, it's his word against mine. No, it's our word against his. Guys… we're rich. We're rich! Look how much is here! Look how much is fucking here! Too much! Inspector, we went straight back to the site, and we found the Jackal lying on the ground, wounded. We called an ambulance straight away. Perhaps the Chinese cheated him. How much did the Jackal have on him? Thirty thousand euros in cash, in the car hood. What do you bet they stole it from the Chinese? No Chinese, no money, that's months of work down the drain. What do we do, sir? Sir, what do we do? Forget about the big shots and keep Yun? What's the point? I want to try something first. - She won't wake up if I turn it up a bit? - No. - Come with me. - What do you want? Why are you back at this time? Did something happen at work? - What happened? - What did you do last night? - What do you want? - Answer me! - I was with Samantha. - With Samantha? Why won't you tell me? - It's my business. - Mauro! It's my business, right? And if you don't like it… You'd better be careful! If this gets out, I'll rip your head off. Stop taking the piss. You're crazy! What happened last night? Do you know anything? Well? - Have you nothing to say? - I'm not a cop, you know. Are you being funny? You were the best cop I ever had. Give me a hand. You're on the streets all day, what do I do? I risk jeopardizing months of checks and stakeouts. And you know what? You owe me one, because I helped you. I risked my neck defending you. Helped me do what? How did you help me? I was a cop, you're an inspector, we don't fucking count. You can't help me. I wanted only one thing. I wanted him to die in jail. And he was out within a week. - But I'm still looking for him. - Looking for who? He was a junkie, he's probably dead by now. - He's a killer, and he's not dead. - What is it you want to do? Become the avenger? Do you know how much shit you got yourself into? How many times I had to protect your ass? Help me out, Ruggero! Turn into here. Park the car and let's go. - Why not? - No way. - Why not? - This place stinks of whores. - Don't be silly. It's nice inside. - I said no. - Come on, it's all arranged. - I said no! You know what? This time I want to do things properly, the way it should be. Do you understand? What are you talking about? Are you crazy? Will you marry me? Will you marry me? You want me to think you love the doctor? I won't fall for it. We've been through too much together. I know you too well, better than anyone else. I know you from the first day you arrived here, when you couldn't speak a word of Italian. You were so beautiful, my darling. - You were out of place here… - Be quiet. Know why I fell in love with you? Why? Because you were different from all these shits. So were you. Does that mean yes? - It means I don't know. - But you do a bit? I don't know. Are you taking the ring? - What if it doesn't fit? - It will. - You see? - It fits. You see? Sam… I promise you I can give you anything you want in life. I don't want anything. I don't want anything. How's it going, Mauretto? Everything okay? - You look like you've seen a ghost. - What the fuck are you doing here? You've gone pale. You've made all this progress, then as soon as you see me you fall apart? Ciro, just leave it. You're hurting me! Think I'd let a guy like you screw me? Let go, you're hurting me! What the fuck do you want? I want what's mine, half of what you stole. What the fuck do you mean? I didn't steal anything! You should thank God I'm offering you a deal. - Even my son heard you. - You're talking crap. Tomorrow I'm going to the cops to report you for robbery. It's your word against mine. Then you won't be able to spend the money! All this hard work to bury the money? You're in trouble, big trouble! All right, I'll do anything you want. I'll do what you want. But on one condition. With the money I give you, you'll pay Dad the arrears. What if I don't give a fuck about your father? Then kill me right now, as you're not getting any. DEAR GIANCARLO, I CAN'T STAND ANYMORE… FOR GIANCARLO - It's ready! - Coming. It's ready! - I thought you'd stopped smoking. - That was my last, come on. Don't let your dad smell it on you. Call your brother, tell him to come to the table, or it'll go cold. - Where is he? - I don't know, try his room. - You been smoking? - No, must be the neighbors. Of course… Now concentrate, the Gran Prix is about to start. Where's my red sweatshirt? Dunno, what are you doing? See how sprightly Mom is? There'll be no stopping her now, she'll be such a pain. Well done, Mauretto. What for? Who gave her the money for the operation? Dad. And who gave it to Dad? It's the money from the shop, from the Neapolitan guy. The Neapolitan guy gave it to him? Hey, it's me, your brother. Look, it all worked out fine. It all worked out fine. We won't have to worry as much now. It didn't work out fine. It's now when you start to worry. What do you mean? Don't waste the money, you're taking over as of today. Taking over what? Tell me, Romolo. - Turn that down. - But it's the Gran Prix! This won't take long. - What's up? - It's something nice. - Thank goodness. - I've rented Ferri's apartment. - Me and Lucia move out tomorrow. - That's great! - Are you happy? - Yes! Then we can talk through the hole! - Who'll look after us? - You've got Mauretto. - Oh great, with 20 euros! - Thanks. I'll get him a job with me. I'll make him toe the line. See who it is. Give me another drop. - Yes. - It's the police. Bon appétit. Mind if we take a look round? What's going on? Where are you going? - What's going on? - You used to be smarter than this. What do you mean? You robbed the Chinese. - He had nothing to do with it. - Quiet, let him speak. What Chinese? - Do you know Giovanni Borrelli? - He's my doctor.
