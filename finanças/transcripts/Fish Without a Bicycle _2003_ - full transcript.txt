(tranquil guitar music) - [Juliana] Do you believe in destiny? Fate some people call it. Or could it be that the road not taken could've been the right road? You know, if you'd only taken it? I for one have no idea, that's why I've been documenting the recent events in my life. Trying to figure out how I've made the mistakes that I've made and God knows there have been a lot of them. Anyways just trying to figure it all out you know. This life thing where I fit in, so here I am. One hour and 37 minutes away from being a quarter of a century old. I wonder what my mom would think of all this? Anyways, where to start? Hmm, Danny. See, there was this guy. (door clicking) - Baby, I'm sleeping. - [Danny] Are you feeling more breakfast-ish or lunch-ish? - Something meaty-ish. - [Danny] That's my girl. - Hmm bacon breath. That was Danny, the most perfect, loving, sensitive guy on the planet and to top it all off, he saves lives for a living. So why did I leave him and end our perfect little white picket fence existence? (laughs) Let me introduce you to Micheal. Have you ever met somebody who made your heart beat so fast you thought you might throw up all over his brown suede loafers? Well, I have. (clapping) - Thank you Miss Juliana. Thank you very much. Miss Juliana? Can you wait out back for a moment? Thank you. - [Juliana] Thank you. - Good job. Hey, I'm glad you got some talent. I don't want my future wife to be a total hack. - Future wife? - [Michael] Uh-huh. - Future, you do remember you're talking to a practically married woman. (chuckles) - What the fireman? Please, we as in you and I are gonna be together. I knew that the minute I heard your voice over the telephone line, before I even saw you. You could've been some ugly fat girl, it's gotta win some points. Have a drink with me. - No. - What are you afraid of? Boo! (laughs) Okay, I'll tell you what, a business drink. You know, two peers enjoying a distilled alcoholic beverage, discussing the art of acting and all that blah-blah-blah. Good, see you tonight at the bar. - The bar? That's a little vague isn't it? - No silly girl, it's really called The Bar, it's on Sunset. - First of all, silly girl I think not. Second of all, I don't date, I live with someone that I'm gonna marry. - Yeah right, you keep telling yourself that. Oh by the way, you got the part. See you there. - Wait a minute, wait. That doesn't mean, no, no, no I'm not going. I can't go, I won't be there. (laughs) (club music) - Hi. - [Juliana] Hi. - Looking for someone? - I don't even know why I'm here and it's not what you think. I'm not that kind of girl. (crickets chirping) (light acoustic guitar music) - Baby? - Yeah. Ssh, don't wake up all the way, go to sleep. - Did you get it? - Yeah. - Congratulations. (chuckles) Must be smart up there, smart people on the moon. - Shh. - Good job. - Go to sleep. (mumbles) - [Juliana Voiceover] Some people say a single moment can change your whole life, a left turn, a right. One decision alters everything. Now I know what they mean. - Go back to sleep. - Okay. - I'll see you in two days. Call me at the station? - Okay. - Congratulations. - Okay. (phone ringing) - This better be highly entertaining. - [Juliana] Vic, it's me. I did something really, really bad. - Yeah, what did you fuck some random guy? - Well, he's not exactly random. - I can't fucking believe this, what the hell happened? - Remember that Michael guy I told you about, the director. Oh by the way, I got the part. - Of course you did, you filthy whore. - Ha, ha, so not funny right now. Okay, so then I met him, you know face to face for the first time. Almost peed in my pants 'cause he's like this sexy, clever, I don't know. He makes Danny seem really simple and when I'm with him it's like being, you know in clever, clever land. I know that's no excuse and I'm a horrible human being and I'm going straight to hell in a basket full of ham. - Well, I'm not gonna disagree with you there but you know, I keep saying baby, you gotta get a couple of more notches in your belt before you settle dawn and get married. You don't even know yourself yet. Have you ever been alone? No, you've always had some adoring guy there, some guy to pick up the pieces when you fall or when you barely stumble or stub your toe and I just think it's time to get out into the world and take some risks. And you know what else, baby? - Vick, you're doing that preachy thing again. - Hey 'ho bag, you want my help or not? - 'Ho bag, yeah, I do. - Don't tell Danny a thing. Move in with me for a bit till you sow your wild oats. I always wanted to use that expression. And when you're done, you go back to Danny or you might not go back to Danny. I mean baby, he's your first, it's like you've eaten brie your whole life. Sure, it's a mild and tasty cheese but how do you know it's your favorite until you try, let's say Gouda or a spicy pepper jack? Come stay with me for a little bit. Try lots of different cheeses and when you're done, Danny will be waiting. Oh, but really important, okay? Listen up, do not, I repeat, do not tell him there's someone else. It'll fuck up the whole thing. - That's so wrong. Do you think it'll work? - Absolutely, just tell him you need a little time to find yourself. Code for I wanna fuck other people. He loves you, he'll wait. God damn, I am good. - Or really evil, jury's still out. - Hey, I am not the one with the big scarlet A on my chest. - Touche. - Now unto the important stuff, I wanna hear all the gruesome details about the sex, are you working lunch? How was the oral? - Ah, inappropriate. - Please, you had sex on the first date. Well, technically it wasn't even a date so that's even worse. Cut the demur act, it no longer holds up. - Yeah, he was good, fine. He's very skilled. - How was the tongue action? Oh god, not the propeller I hope. - [Juliana] Definitely a less is more kinda guy. - [Vick] What a bout the cock? - Let's just say his peignoir is quite adequate. - His peignoir. - His peep. - Peep? - Uch fine, his penis. It's pornographically large and it curves to the right with you know, veins and wrenches and things but not too many and his semen tastes like warm maple syrup. Graphic enough for ya? (clapping) - [Vicki] Well done, my little girl is growing up. - I mean, he's just good at everything, very different than Danny. I guess I actually do like sex. I think I saw God. He was perfect, it was perfect. He actually has a remote for the fireplace. - Ah yes, nothing like fake logs to set the mood. - Remote control fireplace. A little cheesy, I know, nonetheless, I made sure it was part of the selling price. - Oh, so you own this place then. - I do, yes. Not only am I mildly handsome and relatively talented, I also have family money. - Oh, that must be nice. I've had to work since I was 13. - That's probably good for you, it builds character. - I presume that means that you have no character. - Evidently. - I should go, I'm gonna go. - You wanna see my etchings? - Etchings? Smooth. - They were very good etchings, very masterfully done. (laughs) Shut up, he's just, I don't know? Okay, maybe it wasn't that romantic. He says these things, you know, that on somebody else it might to see like that big of a deal but on him, it's just perfect. Perfect. - I know the type, danger, that's all I'm saying. - Oh God, can we hold you to that? - Yeah, you can. - Jules, do what you want. It's about time you had a little danger in your life. - Yes, that is true. I should have danger, I should throw worry to the wind. You guys better look out 'cause I am Danger Girl. From now on I'm gonna wear a cape, the whole thing. - Okay, okay if one more person, any of you, say danger in the next two minutes I'm gonna lose it and sweetie, it's throw caution to the wind. - Whatever. What time is it? Oh, keys, late, rehearsal, I gotta go. - Go get them. - Ah, Miss Juliana meet Master Benjamin, he'll be playing the role of Johnny. - Hi, it's just Ben. - You look like a Johnny and kinda like a cowboy. - Oh well, I'm from Dayton, Ohio actually but you know, it's funny. I always had kind of a nonsexual crush on Clint Eastwood. - Really? - Yeah, quintessential Marlboro man... - [Juliana] Me too. - Okay enough niceties, let's get a couple of things out of the way. I am the director, therefore as actors I expect you guys to follow my direction and fill it. I know what I'm doing so trust me and I promise you I will steer you in the right direction, okay? Juliana, all that smiling you were doing in the audition? It's out, this character doesn't smile, all right? And Brad... - Ben. - Ben, I'm sorry. Ben, you seem too faggoty for lack of a better word. Man him up, okay? Maybe wear a cowboy hat to every rehearsal. Boots I think would be a good idea to ground you, all right? Okay, why don't we do this. We'll take it from the top, no pressure, relaxed. I'll watch it, comment, if I see something I don't like, I'll stop you, okay? So, let's take it from the top. This is when you first come in, the first time you're seeing her, right? (laughs) Okay, let's stop right there. You're a good actor but I don't believe you at all, all right. You come in like a dancer. This guy is not a dancer, he's a cowboy, you understand? 'cause you're not, you know, you're coming in with this apology. This guy doesn't apologize to anybody. You come in, you own your space, most importantly you own her. This is the woman you want, a sexy gal, okay? You gotta be, you know, this is an alpha male, not a beta male. - Okay. - [Micheal] You're looking at me? - Yeah. - All right, alpha male. Gotta change your thinking a little bit, all right? Can you do me a favor? Can you tighten your neck up a little bit? You know what I mean by that? A little loose in the neck. Bit of a swivel head, all right? Tighten up, all right. Square up, man up, okay. Take it again. Have fun. And no, okay see you're winding up, all right. - [Ben] You were really something in there. - Yeah? - [Ben] Yeah. - Something good or something really bad 'cause that's really one of those open-ended comments that could go either way. - Right, it's kinda like you look stunning could mean you're a real beauty or you could stop people in their tracks with the sheer grotesqueness of your physical form. - Exactly like that, yeah. You're funny. - [Ben] Funny ha-ha or funny weird? You see, that's another one. - Oh, yes it is. - Is he stalking you or... - Mine. (light funk music) - Well, that was very awkward. - You think? (grunts) - Oh, Jesus. (grunts) Unbelievable, whoo. Oh my God. Wow. - That wasn't too bad. - [Michael] First time swallowing, huh? - Yep. - Yeah, well get used to it. If we get married that's part of the prenup. - [Juliana] Prenup? - Family money remember? - Pretty romantic pillow talk there. - Yeah well, what can I say? I'm smooth. - Oddly enough you are. Got that? - Yeah. Cheek, cheek, gotta wait 20 minutes before I kiss the mouth. (sniffs) (book rustling) - Pay attention to me. Meow. Come on, sweethead, you've been meditating for like two hours. Pay attention to me. Pay attention to me or I'm gonna urinate on the grass. - Okay, first of all, I'm having proximity issues, okay? And second of all, stop being so fucking needy. Not a good color on you. - Sorry, just left my first love in a crying heap on the ground today, I might be a little needy. - Okay, first of all we ought to establish something. I'm not that guy all right? I'm not so much with the being needed. If that's who you are, go to Vicki. God know she has nothing better to do than be at your beck and call. (sighs) - You amaze me. - Come on, what are you, sugarsnatch, all right. I'm sorry, I'm trying to get centered, you're all over me. I had a stressful week. Where are you going? You're leaving? That's mature. - Okay, so I realized I was still in my jammies. If you laugh, I'll kill you. (light acoustic guitar music) ♪ Sent you a little note because I felt like it ♪ ♪ Wrote you a little song that was the perfect fit ♪ ♪ And I'm not suppose to ♪ - [Vicki] What happened? - He has proximity issues. - What? - I put my arms around him 'cause I needed some attention, you know with the whole Danny thing. He said that I was needy and yelled proximity. - What a fucking asshole. Baby, don't even make this about you for a second. We're gonna go home and unpack your things over Cosmos and I'm sure he'll realize the error of his ways and call and beg for your forgiveness. - Maybe I'm making a mistake. I mean, Danny is so perfect right? Do I smell bad? (sniffing) - No, you're fine. - I never told you this but he used to make me dress up in heels and this crotchless fishnet body stocking when I cooked him dinner. Don't laugh, creepsicle. (laughs) First it was just for special occasions, you know like birthday, Valentine's Day and then he wanted it all the time, cheesy. And the sex was just so acrobatic. He always wanted it to last like three hours with all these positions he read about in some Kama Sutra book and if I wasn't in the mood, he'd get all pouty. This one time, he freaked out and broke that snow globe, remember that one that played "Fur Elise". I loved that thing. I love Michael, I'm gonna call him. - No baby, you cannot give away your power like that. Okay, hey listen, listen yeah, yeah. (light funk music) - Yeah, I love that song, yeah crank it up. Ha-ha, ah, yeah. Yeah. - No holy shit, is in "Living Color" still on 'cause you could be a Fly Girl. - Don't bother me, I'm dancing. - Is that what you kids are calling it these days? (phone ringing) - Turn it down, turn it down. Hello. - [Ben] Hey, it's Ben. - Ben? Oh, Ben sorry I just... - [Ben] Are you okay? Do you need anything? - [Juliana] No. - [Ben] I was hoping maybe we could run lines over dinner. - I can't, I gotta go. - [Ben] Okay. ♪ Baby, she's all right with me ♪ - We need to go out, we are going out. Torturing lots of men and not mentioning the spawn of Satan. (upbeat rock music) ♪ Everything these days ♪ ♪ I can kiss the universe ♪ ♪ When you get away ♪ - Hey, can I buy you a drink? - What? - Can I buy you a drink? - If you buy me a drink will I be expected to talk to you? - Yeah, that's kinda what I was aiming at. - Then it would be a bad investment for ya, bye. - Holy shit baby, that was harsh. That was so unlike you and frighteningly close to me but well done. - Let the torture begin. - Welcome to the dark side. (upbeat rock music) Two shots of tequila. - Are you a Solid Gold dancer? - [Vick] Yeah, do I have to pay extra for the comedy? - No, the comedy is on the house. - That's mighty white of you, thanks. - Yeah, yes. (laughs) When I first met him, Danny was like so manly and fit. - What? - What? (laughs) Manly and fit. I used to like it and then after a while his limbs were just heavy. (laughs) Limbs, it's a funny word, limbs. - Yeah, it's hilarious. - I guess he just had a fitness fetish, fetish and a foot fetish and actually a fetish for gay porn. - Well the gay porn thing is understandable. But feet, that's gross. Can I have two more for us, thanks. I guess I didn't know everything about the perfect couple. I suppose that could be because you totally ditched me when he came into the picture but we'll save that discussion for another time. Anyway, why didn't you tell me? - I thought it was disrespectful to discuss your relationship with other people. - Well discuss away, how did the scene go down? - What scene? Oh, the break-up scene? More horrifying that you possibly imagine. - What are you doing up? That's funny, I was actually just thinking when you used to hang out and wait for me by the door just like a little puppy. (laughs) Going somewhere? Hi. It's nice to see you, baby. - I'm leaving. - You're leaving? You're leaving, leaving? - Yeah. - Where are you going? - I gotta go find myself, I don't know? I'm confused. - You gotta go find yourself? - I know that sounds cliche, I'm sorry, I don't know. I don't have any answers. - What do you mean you gotta go find yourself? Find yourself what, what are you talk... - I'm not happy. - How can you not be happy? What's there not to be happy about? We've got a wonderful life here. - Something's different, something's just changed for me. - Are you seeing someone? Are you seeing someone? Oh don't even tell me, don't. Are you seeing someone? - Let's just, let's not do that. - [Danny] Are you seeing someone? - Just let me go. - Let you go? You're not walking out this door until you tell me what the fuck is going on? - Fine, I'm seeing someone, okay. I'm sorry. - Who? - [Juliana] Just let me go. - Who are you seeing? - Just let me go, please. - Get the fuck outta here, get the fuck outta here, get the fuck... - That's horrifying? My dear girl you have been so sheltered. Let me tell you a little story. I was dating this guy, Jonathan. Total trust fund baby, right? - Yeah, uh, I'm, I'm bored. I'm, I'm gonna go. When you're over this, um, call me. Better yet, uh, don't call me, I will call you. - I wasn't done talking yet. - Really, Vick? Are you ever done talking? - No. You did not just say that. No, you cannot do that. You're not gonna do that to me. Fuck you. You cannot just leave. Fuck you. Fuck you. Fuck you, you, you jerk mother fucker. - Needless to say, he never did call. (laughing) - That is the foulest thing I've ever heard. You're my hero. - Yep, that's me. The superhero that flings tampons at the speed of light. So, in comparison, I would say your break-up was quite dignified. - I guess so. (laughing) - [Vick] Another round, please? - Nuh-uh. No. No, I can't. (laughing) - It's okay. I'll do it too. I'll hold your hair while you puke. (vomiting) Okay, get it out. All out, baby. - It's out, it's out. - [Vick] Okay. Okay. - Sorry. Sorry. - All right, upsy daisy. Okay. Okay. Over here. Thank you. That cabbie was hot. I wanted to give him my number, but you can't date the help. - The help? What are we, the Kennedys? - Ronnie? I want my key back. (laughing) - [Automated Voice] No messages. - I don't get it. He used to call me, like every 10 minutes in the beginning. - In the beginning, Jules? You've known the man a month. This is still the beginning. - I wonder if he's met somebody else. Maybe I should go talk to him. Will you take me? - No. No way. You, you do not want him to see you or smell you like this. Men are very visual, a.k.a., shallow. Next time he sees you, you have to look hot. - Yeah. - That is if you're hell-bent on this guy, which I don't get. But, whatever. You also need to remind him that there are plenty of guys who want to give you the hot beef injection. - Hot beef injection? - [Vick] I know. Good stuff. Compliments of the cinematic gem, "The Breakfast Club." When's the next rehearsal? - Monday. - Okay. That gives us two days to get you a rockin' dress and three dates. We'll call Lola. She knows tons of guys. - Why doesn't he call? Why, why, why, why? - Hey, focus. You have to have a game plan, and who better to guide you than the Princess of Darkness, that of course being me. That's what I do these days, give myself self-proclaimed titles. God, my life is sad. - Yeah, well, I don't feel like playing. I just wanna love him. I have no game. - [Vick] And what happens when you just love him. Let me remind you, proximity. Need I say more? - Yeah, yeah. You know when he totally had me? - [Vick] At hello? - The first time I went to his place, he asked me if I wanted to see his deck. - His what? - No, not my dick. My deck. As in my patio, balcony. - Right, yeah. That's, that's what I thought you meant. - Right. Shall we? - Sure. How come your telescope's facing that hotel? - Because I have an unhealthy fascination with watching strangers have sex. - Wow. - Yeah. - Can't believe you didn't even try and make something up. Deny it. But at least you realize it's unhealthy and perverse. - I never said perverse. You're so puritanical. And, yes, that is a word. Did you go to Catholic school? - As a matter of fact, I did. - Uh-huh. - And is Puritan anything like Amish? Because if it is, you're way off. Look, drinking. Heavily. - Wow. Impressive. I will now get you some more of the blood of Christ. Okay? - [Juliana] From that moment he owned me. - I don't know. The whole thing just sounds a little too perfect. Call me cynical. - Cynical. - Guys like that know all the right things to say. I call them the wordsmiths. They're the most dangerous of their species. - Cynical. (sniffing) - Smells like a vaginga in here. - Ronnie, why can't you buy your own coffee? - You know what? You should really turn yourself into a nice douche. - I want my key back. You can't just come in here whenever you want, okay? - That's just crazy talk. Don't you know the incredibly manly neighbor always gets the spare key? - Ronnie, stop it. - Huh? You need my protection. - [Vick] I do not. - Oh, good morning my little brazione. - Too loud. I need something greasy. - Okay. - Greasy? (chuckles) Greasy. Greasy? - Don't, don't make me laugh. - Ronnie, Ronnie. Ronnie, go back to your room. FYI, my underwear drawer is now booby-trapped. - Did you say booby? (laughing) - Go on. - Have you ever, uh, seen that ad that said every woman should own a dress that could make a grown man cry? Words to live by. - [Man] Welcome to the Meat Palace? Would you like to try our zesty jalapeno poppers today? - No, I'm trying to cut down. What do you want? - Philly cheesesteak. - Do you have a Philly cheesesteak? - [Man] Philly cheesecake? - No. Philly cheesesteak, sandwich. - [Man] I'm sorry. What was that? Philly cheese shake? - No. Philly cheese. Fuck. Two burgers, onion rings, fries and two diet Cokes. (laughing) So it lives. - That was high comedy. - I think you have to be borderline retarded to work at these places. (upbeat rock music) - Oh, yeah. This is so the one. ♪ I can't sleep, I'm wide awake ♪ - Oh, for God's sake. Who dresses you? ♪ All I can see is burning ash, burning ash ♪ - Next time, it is all you. Your mommy's a big girl now. - Hey, are you sure? - [Vick] Go. ♪ Tell me he's afraid to just go jump on a plane ♪ - You should get a Playboy wax. - [Juliana] Playboy? - Yeah. You have like a little landing strip. It's also called the Brazilian or Around the World. - Wow. Your knowledge of hair removal is astounding. You should write a book. Or a pamphlet at least. - Hilarious. Holy shit. - [Juliana] Good? - Yeah. - What would I do without you? - Become a victim of the poly-cotton blend for starters. You look spankin' hot. He's toast. - High five. Ow. No punching. No violence. - [Curly] Nyuh, nyuh, nyuh. (clattering) (shouting) I wonder if he's thinking about me. I heard if you write a guy's name a thousand times that he'll come back to you. Or there's this spell with five red candles and honey, but I'd need a lock of his hair. - Hmm, let's just try my way first before we run out and get a cauldron and the eye of newt. (Stooges whooping) - I'm oddly attracted to Moe. - Yeah, me, too. (knocking) - Vicki, my cable's out. The Yanks are on. - Maybe if you paid the bill, fuckin' ginny. - Come here, Ronnie. Come sit by me. I'm feeling needy. - She asked me to come sit by her. Dare I take that as a sign? Beat it, the Yanks are on. - [Juliana] All right. I'm gonna make some diner. - We just ate 18 candy bars. - Okay, work with me. Distraction operative word, okay? - Okay, baby. Better Crocker your ass off. (laughing) Ronnie. - Do me a favor, keep it down in there, all right? I already missed three winnings. (grunting) - [Vick] What are you cooking? - Boiled eggs. - [Vick] Why? - You know how I feel about bubbles and water. - Oh, yeah, right, I forgot. - Can't play like O'Neil. Hey, girls, let me tell you somethin', all right? Yankees aren't a baseball team. It's a way of life. So let's get with it. - How would you describe me? - What do you mean? - I was just thinking, you know. I don't even know how I'd describe me. That can't be good. You know, what are my hobbies, my dreams, my aspirations? - All that stuff I said about finding yourself wasn't just shit off the top of my head. I think you need to spend a little time alone. Maybe men aren't the answer. In the infamous words of Bono, "A woman needs a man like a fish needs a bicycle." So with this Michael thing, why do you want him so bad? - Because. Because. Because. - Because. ♪ Because ♪ ♪ Because of the wonderful things he does ♪ (laughing) - Okay, I'm gonna pretend that never happened and I have that 30 seconds of my life back. - My guys, I love 'em. Come here. I love you. I love you. But not in a gay way, you know. Just like, like Viking men. - But if you just have to have him back, here's the game plan. We're gonna go get mannies and pedis and bikini waxes tomorrow. You'll be wooed by three men, I'll take care of that, who you will use for your ego boost and toss aside like rubbish. Finally, you will show up at rehearsal looking like Venus de Milo, with arms, of course. You will seduce him and leave him wanting more and the rest will be cake. Tell him that your character would dance in the scene that you're doing. Give your scene partner a pseudo lap dance. - Shut up. Lap dance? - Lap dance. - Hey, hey, no balls. How about this here? Huh, baby? Here you go, no balls. What do you think of that? Hee. You know what this stands for? Boston sucks. That's what it stands for. - Windex. - Sure. No, you don't know who you're dealing with right now, okay? Please, don't start with me. (doorbell ringing) Uh-huh. Yeah, so who's the man? Say it. That's right. That's right. Talk to you tomorrow. Score. (doorbell ringing) - [Vick] Yeah? - Hey. - Smooth opener. But I'm not your girl. - Double score. Are you guys roommates? Hot. - Don't worry, Goldilocks. She's your girl. Yeah, sometimes we get, uh, drunk and go down on each other in front of company. - Mimosas anyone? - [Vick] Okay, kids. You have fun. Have her home by midnight or I'm calling Papa Bear. - First went to Awry last year. My chakras are really off, you know. - You got a lotta hair. - Awry suggested I go to this meditation retreat up in Joshua Tree, so, man, it was four days of Zen. - Can you put up one of those scrunchy things so it doesn't shed all over the Aaron-mobile? - It was Zen that I realized I was a ninja in a past life. So I went out and got every book about ninjas. - So I thought we'd go to the Mondrian for a little brunch. They got the best banana pecan crepes and then to Richie's for some chai. - Oh, is Richie's the new coffee house? - Oh, you're so, don't lose that. Richie Gere's house, baby doll. He and my dad did a little movie together. You might've heard of it. "An Officer and a Gentleman." - Oh. So you like to read? - Uh, actually, they're books on tape. - So, uh, how about a little humvee before brunch? - Did you ask me to give you head? Cancel Bachelor Number Three. Don't even think about questioning me and, no, I don't want to talk about it. - [Vick] You have a visitor. - [Ben] Hi. - Hi. What are you doing here? - Boy, she really knows how to make a guy feel welcome, doesn't she? - Sorry. Seriously though, what are you doing here? - Well, I just, I wanted to check up on you and, you know, you, you seemed, uh, pretty upset last night so I... - Oh. That's, that's nice. I'm, I'm fine, really. I was just kinda feeling a little depressed and mixed, hi. - Hi. - Hi. - You, um, you wanna... - Yeah, let's. - Yeah. Okay. (light rock music) You look really pretty today. - Oh, thanks. So do you. Um... - Yeah, thanks. - Pretty cool, that is. (laughing) - [Ben] That's a really, nice save. - Thanks. - Uh. So what are you, auditioning for one of those, uh, blind date shows or something? Rehearsing? - What did Vick tell you? - No, she just told me that you've been on a few dates recently, that's all. - Yeah, it's kinda silly, but, um, trying to build up my self-esteem. (chuckles) - For who? Michael? - How'd you know that? - Oh, I'm a pretty, I'm a smart guy. - Yeah, well, I don't wanna talk about it. - All right. - I mean, I shouldn't talk about it with you, you know. - Okay. - Might make rehearsals weird, awkward. - Right. - I love him. - Hmm. - He makes me feel all, uh, all cloudy, you know, like, like the morning after you've taken NyQuil. - Oh, uh, medicine head, you mean. NyQuil's the nighttime sniffling, sneezing, coughing, aching, stuffy head... - Aching, stuffy head, fever so you can rest medicine? - Yeah. (laughing) I thought I was the only one who stored arbitrary information in my mental Rolodex. - No, no, I have a, I have a plethora of arbitrary facts myself. Arsenal, if you will. - I will. - Like, did you know if you, uh, chopped up a Japanese sea cucumber and you put it in a dish it would retake its original shape in 24 hours? - Can't say that I did. Did you know that the woman who lived across the hall from the Jeffersons is really Lenny Kravitz's mom? Huh? - That's fascinating. But I did know that. Uh, what's tiramisu? - Uh, an Italian dessert made with lady fingers soaked in espresso topped with mascarpone cheese and shaved Ghirardelli chocolate. Thank you very much. - Very good. - Who's a third-tonner? - Uh, I don't know. I don't know. You stumped me with that one. - Yeah. Good tangent though. - No, it was a very good, very good tangent. So, um, so should we talk about, uh, Michael a little more? Maybe? - Actually, I don't wanna talk about it. I feel better. - Well, that's good. Good. All right. Well, gosh. In that case, I guess I was, uh, your third blind date then. - Golly, I guess you were. (chuckles) You're cool. - Gee, thanks. (laughing) - [Vick] He's a hottie. Can I have him? - No. - [Vick] Why? Do you want him? - No, I don't want him. I'm in love, remember? He's just a nice guy, that's all. - What, I can't date a nice guy? Touche. (light piano music) Remember, sexy and aloof. - I can't do sexy and aloof. - [Vick] It's like a role. You're playing Marilyn Monroe. - I feel more like Marilyn Manson. I can't do this. I can't pull this off. Hey, whatever happened to simple, you know? Like, boy meets girl, boy loves girl, vice versa. They ride off into the sunrise. - [Vick] Sunset. - Whatever. You know what I mean. I mean, when did life get so complicated? I wish things were simple again, you know? Like when I was little and everything was like a slice of pie. - Easy as pie. - Whatever. You know what I mean. I just don't think I can do this adult thing. It's a lot of work. - You just have to stop being so naive. Men are exactly like dogs. They have to be trained. A well-trained dog will always be there for you, licking you and panting like an idiot. - That's kind of cynical. I mean, I want a man to be my equal, not my pet. You know, maybe I am looking at life through rose-colored glasses, but I just... - It's rose-colored bifocals. - Bifocals? That's weird. You know what? Maybe you're right. I mean, my way isn't exactly working like a charm. And I have always been good with animals. - That's my girl. - You're a genius. Sorry. It worked. It worked. I did it. - Okay, let's not pick out the china just yet. What happened? - Well, I did everything you said, with the lap dance, everything. And at one point he took off his shoe and he threw it at me and said I was damned sexy. Isn't that great? He thinks I'm damned sexy. Oh, my God. I'm so excited, I could throw up. - Can you not doing it in these please? First of all, I'm not too thrilled about you just jumping right back into this. Did he even apologize for proximity? - Well, no, I mean, it didn't come up, but... - How convenient for him. Ooh. And secondly, (chuckles) um, the guy's a dick. - I'm not listening. I'm not listening. La-la-la-la-la. Come on, Vick. Just be happy for me. You can't just be happy for me. You know what, enough with the preaching already, okay? As you so condescendingly put it, I'm a big girl now so why don't you start treating me like one. - So I guess we're not painting my apartment this weekend? Women. (chuckles) You can't live, yeah. (light acoustic guitar music) Hi. Whatcha doing? - Um, I'm gonna go to Michael's. - [Vick] Why would you do that? - Um, I don't wanna get into this with you. I don't, I don't, I don't, I don't want to fight with you about this, okay? - Oh, I don't wanna fight. I don't wanna fight with you at all. I just think it's maybe a respect issue, that if you're staying at my house and then I walk in and you're leaving you might want to tell me why. - It's always about you, isn't it, Vick? It's a respect issue, is it? - No, it is a respect issue and it isn't always about me, actually. - You do this every time. You do this every single time. You were all excited about, just do the dress and do this thing and, and get him back. And then I get him back and what do you say? - I didn't realize you were gonna be an idiot about it. I didn't realize that, like, I was gonna help you with something. - [Juliana] That's great. - And then you were gonna fucking run back to him. - That's great. That's great. I'm an idiot. You know what? Aren't I always an idiot according to you? - Actually, most of the time, yes. Yes, you are. I'm trying to help you here. - [Juliana] You're something else. You know what? And you wonder, you wonder why you don't have any friends. You wonder why there's no guy that sticks around. - [Vick] No guy fuckin' sticks around 'cause I don't stick around. - Right. (chuckles) Yeah. - No, go, go, go, go. Go. Go. I'm happy you're going. - Good, good. Because I'm not coming back. Okay? - I can't get laid when you're here. You know, it's fuckin' hard. - Yeah, 'cause that, that's what's important to you, isn't it? Meaningless sex. Meaningless anything so that you don't have to think about yourself. - This guy that you're going to go stay with? He doesn't give a shit. He doesn't give a shit. - Nobody gives a shit, do they? - [Vick] No, they don't. - It's all, it's just all a big joke. - [Vick] Yeah. - Not to me, it isn't. Okay? - Phew. Hey, beautiful. - Hey. Thanks for coming. I, I didn't know who else to call. - Well, it's no problem. Where's Michael? - It's his Pilates night. (laughing) - He's done at eight. - Pilates. Jeez. - I'm scared. All the time. I don't know where I'm going or what I'm doing or why. And I don't want to end up like my mom. She gave up. She gave me her engagement ring, you know. And I can't even wear it, I'm still so angry. But I'm starting to understand how life can do that to you, you know? Make you want to give up. I mean, is this it? Is this what we were in such a hurry to grow up and do? Because if this is it, I'm not so sure I'm interested. I really need her now. I miss my mom. I really miss my mom. (light rock music) When I was little and I felt bad, my dad used to always dance with me. And it made me feel better. (light rock music) (knocking on door) - Hi, baby. What are you doing with that big bag? Are you moving in? - Vick and I had a fight. I need to stay with you 'til I find a place. - Oh, thank Christ. Ding-dong the witch is dead. - No, don't do that. - Oh, feisty. Okay. Tell you what. How about you blow me to take your mind off things? I know how you like that. I'm kidding. Oh. Okay. It's gonna be like that. Hmm. Just don't drag me into your little drama then. - You're mean. Why do you act like this? Is it some deep-seated psychological trauma from your childhood or what? - Do me a favor. Spare me the Psyche 101, please. It's so boring. - I'm trying to give you the benefit of the doubt here. Seriously, why do you act like this? - Well, 'cause I refuse to sugarcoat, that's why. Okay, I speak the truth. It may come across a bit harsh, but I refuse to deal with the bullshit most people pawn off as common courtesy. That's why. - What, you're above common courtesy? - Uh, yeah, I believe I am. - Yeah? Well, well, you're certainly not above acting like a, a jackass. You know, you might actually try being nice to people sometime. You might like it, you pompous, arrogant, jackass. - Oh, my God. You are goddamned sexy when you're mad. Ow. Don't. That'll teach me. - [Juliana] All right, that's it. - All right, easy, easy temper. Come on. Take it easy. I'm sorry. I was being shitty, all right. I think it was the Pilates, released some toxins. I just wanna come over and apologize. Tell ya I'm sorry for being shitty and stuff and maybe also to, uh, bite your neck. (laughing) - Stop. Creep. - Wait a minute. Am I creep or am I a jackass? - Both. - I can live with that. Hmm. Your skin, you smell like apricots. - Oh, you're goddamned sexy. - Well, there's no need to blaspheme.

Hi. - It's for you. - Thanks. - [Both] You look great. - I'm really glad you came. - [Vick] I'm really glad I came. - I'll stop talking now. - You were really something out there. - Thanks. - No, no, I mean, you really have that something. - [Juliana] Now you sound my like mom. - [Vick] She would've been proud, Jules. - You think? I really miss her. - Hey. - [Juliana] Yeah? - You're gonna get mascara all over this badass dress that you have not even commented on. - You look foxy. - [Vick] That was some shameless fishing. - Really shameless. Why don't you come with us to the bar for a drink? - [Vick] Who's us? - The cast and me and Michael. - Sure. (laughing) I'll, um, I'll bring Ronnie with me. That way I don't have to be alone with him, at least not until I'm good and liquored up - Oh, good, the panty sniffer. Great. - What can I say? I'm having a dry spell. Okay. - High five. No punching. Why with the punching? (knocking on door) - [Ben] Hey. These just came for ya. - Wow. - Hey, hot stuff. - [Ben] Hey. - You were great. - Thanks. - I'll leave you to bask in your glory. - Okay, I'll see you later. Dad. (light rock music) - I think it'd look better on me. (laughing) - [Juliana] Get outta here. - Finish getting changed. You know you should wear that thing more often. - I know, it's cheesy. But he calls princess. But, again, I'm sure all dad's do that. - No, not mine. Thank Christ. (laughing) I don't' think it's cheesy. I think it's fitting. You know what? Your performance tonight, in my opinion, was worthy of an Oscar nod. - Oh, you don't say. - Hmm. No, I do. Especially based on all the agents that left their cards for you. - Hmm. You weren't too shabby yourself there, mister. As for the agent thing, I think I'm gonna have to pass. I mean, I don't know. I, I liked being up there under the lights and everything. But there's just something missing. - Well, you'll find that missing link. And I don't mean a Neanderthal man. Goofball. - I already have my caveman. - Uh-huh. I know. And he does Pilates. (laughing) - Have you always been this funny and charming and all around perfect? - Yes, yes, and yes. No. (laughing) No. Actually, uh, I used to be a, a bit of a shady bastard. I've been sober for four years. I'm in AA. And I actually, I have tattoos that I don't even remember getting. - Can I see one? (chuckles) - You know, I don't think management would take too kindly to me dropping trou right here in the middle of the bar, so maybe we should wait for another time. (laughing) - Good thinking, yeah. You're an odd bird. I like it. - Hey, great job in the play tonight. - Thanks. - Yeah, I loved that costume and that hat was boss. You should keep acting. Good for you. Yeah. Hey, did you see Vicki around? - Uh, no, but, you know what? I'll go look for her. I gotta walk around anyway. My foot keeps falling asleep. See you later. ♪ Then you'll think back to those days ♪ - Hey. My two favorite people in the world talking? Are they getting to know each other? - [Michael] That we are. Right, Vick? - Okay, then. Just keep, you know, keep doing that and I'll just go back to where I came from. Just don't wanna... - Actually, we were just done. I think you and I should get reacquainted. - I love you, Sweethead. Did I do good? - I told you, Sugarsnatch, you were fine. Talk about it later. And do me a favor. Please take off that ridiculous thing. - Don't worry, Mikey. You can wear it later. - Thanks. Great talking to you. I feel like we really connected. Don't talk to guys. - We won't. - Ronnie's looking for ya. - I'll bet. And give 'em one great blow job, they turn into a fucking deer tick. He can wait. I need a smoke. - Wow. You were really great in the play. Uh, I was a little disappointed though. I, I thought you might take your top off. But that didn't happen. I saw you last, last year when you, "Danny and the Deep Blue Sea." Yeah, you didn't take your top off then either. I felt cheated. Um, uh, I, I usually see you up at, uh, Runyan, uh, hiking up at Runyan but I haven't seen you around in awhile. But you probably busy, you know. Top off. - Thank you for coming to the show. Um, you know, you might wanna come back. Anything can happen. It's live theater, you know. I'll see you later. - I have one word for you. Stalker. - No. He was sweet. Except he kept staring at my breasts. A little awkward. Besides there is something to be said for being stalk-worthy. - [Vick] And now I know you're drunk. - I'm not drunk. Give me one of those. - And smoking now too? You are just living on the edge. - [Juliana] I told you, Vick. Throwing around caution when it's windy. - Hmm. - Oh, oh, look at me. Breaking the no smoking in bars rule. I'm a lawbreaker. - Rebel. Jules, I need to tell you something. - I am a rebel. Cool. Oh, oh. I forgot to tell you. Michael asked me to marry him. Well, I mean, he didn't exactly propose, but he asked me to move in, so I'm going to. Isn't that great? - I'm happy for you, babe. Whatever makes you happy. - And now you guys are getting along and, I don't know, maybe we can go on a double date. You and whoever and me and Michael. Hmm. Me and Michael. Michael and I. Isn't he amazing? - He's amazing all right. (heavy rock music) - Yes, I am a director and you are an actress. - [Woman] How could you tell? - You got that je ne sais quoi. - [Woman] A what? - Sorry. That's French. I studied in Europe. That it quality, you know. You should audition in my theater company sometime. - You have your own company? - Uh-huh. Not only am I relatively handsome, I also have family money. - You're more than relatively handsome. - Really? Hey? My jaw line? What is it? My deep, dark, mysterious eyes? Oh, the cleft. Thank you. I had that, you know, surgically implanted. - Hey. - Hey. - Everybody's looking for you to take your pictures over there. - Oh, I'll go get Michael. I'm gonna take this thing off. Excuse me. Michael? - Vicki. Thanks a lot, asshole. - Oh, shut up. You. Oh, okay. What the fuck are you looking at? - Oh. (chuckles) You know, I'm looking at a truly pathetic human being. - All right. I get it. You're defending her honor. How gallant. - You shut the fuck up, all right? You're not talking to me later. Let's go. - What, are you kidding me? Is this where you tell me to step outside or put up your dukes? - Or how about I'm getting ready to open up a can of whoopass? - Okay, how about that? No, no, not my face. Not my face. Please, not the face. - Baby. I am so sorry. I saw this coming from a mile away. I hate to say I told you so, but... - But you will anyway, right? Great. Why don't you give yourself a great big pat on the back? You were right again. Right about Michael, Danny, everything. And just everything to just cut me a little bit of slack. I know I'm making mistakes left and right and I am scared to death. And I thought by this point in my life maybe I could have a career or love or something. So there you go. You're the genius, I'm the idiot. - No. You're not an idiot. I'm the idiot. I, I can't believe I made the one person that I actually give a shit about feel like this. I'm trying to say something here. I just don't know how. Jules, you can have love. - What are you talking about? - I love you. I've loved you since the third grade. Wow. That felt good to say out loud. Do you remember you were riding on my handlebars and you fell off and broke your tooth? That's when I knew. I've tried to deny it and everything else and, I mean it's not like I'm generally attracted to women. It's just you. I guess I'm gay, I don't know. I don't know. (sighing) I guess that's why no guy has ever stood a chance because I have always been in love with the girl next door. I know that sounds kinda sappy, but... - Hey, stop, please stop, okay? You're just gonna, you're gonna stop talking now and we're gonna pretend that this never happened and, and we're just gonna go back to the way things were before, okay? - No, no, we are not. Jules, I don't expect you to love me back. I just, I just want you to acknowledge what I just told you. - I can't do that. This never happened.

(sighing) I don't know what I'm doing. And I don't know what I wanna do with the rest of my life. I think I'm in love with this guy, but he just turns me inside out, you know. And then my best friend, out of the blue, kisses me and says I love you, I've always loved you. - Oh, well, I'm rooting for that best friend. I mean, if he says he loves you and he's your best friend, that's problem solved. - Not quite. He's a she. - Well, honey. Life's too short to worry about color, gender, all that nonsense. What matters is who's your soul mate. Hmm? Could be a 65 year old guy. Could be a woman, uh, who you bumped into and you dropped your book and she picks it up and looks straight into your soul. Now, don't push anything that doesn't fit into your little idea box. As for what you're gonna do with the rest of your life, I can't help you there. But I think you already know. Look within. That's where the answers lie. I think I read that in a fortune cookie somewhere. (laughing) Oh, my. Look at that sparkler. - Yeah. It was my mom's. She gave it to me before she died. - [Greta] Oh. - Said I might need it some day. - I had a daughter once. I had a whole life once. Seems like two lifetimes ago now though. - Well, it looks like I've got a little time on my hands. Wanna go grab a bite, talk? I'm, I'm Juliana, by the way. - I'm Greta. It's a pleasure to make your acquaintance. - Likewise. - [Greta] Well, uh, thank you. - I'll get that. - [Greta] Get my chair? - [Juliana] Does it fold up? - [Greta] Yes. - [Juliana] Cool. (laughing) Ooh, it's got a little handle. Nifty. - [Greta] You know, the Star down here, they have a bottomless cup of coffee. - [Juliana] They do? (church bells ringing) - Hi, Mom. I don't know where to start. Um, I forgive you. There, I said it. And I really wish that I'd said it before you died, but I was too busy holding a grudge to notice all the signs. I guess you knew you wanted to die. I guess everybody knew but me. And I know that what you did to me wasn't your fault. You were sick. You need, you needed help. You needed somebody to help you. But goddamn it, Mom, why? Sorry. I just wish you would've let somebody help you, you know? Do you remember that time that I, I cut my foot when I went to the Bozo's circus and you let me sleep next to you? And you sang me that Irish blessing and I picked at that mole on your neck until I made it bleed? (laughing) I know that's a really weird thing to store in your mental Rolodex, but, God, I loved laying there next to you. The way your skin felt. Anyways, I'm, I'm rambling.

But, um, I'm staying at the hostel by the Y, so if you could meet me in the morning? Oh, no, it's, it's safe. One more night's not gonna kill me, I hope. Anyway, I, I'll see you then. Okay, bye. (light acoustic guitar music) So that's it. That's my story and I'm sticking to it. That's how I got to be right here right now on my birthday, August the 7th, the year of our Lord, 2003. Was it my destiny to meet Greta on the street corner? Is it my destiny to travel the country telling untold stories? I don't know. But I feel like I'm starting to figure it out, you know. But for now I am leaving Los Angeles. Kinda like that Sheryl Crow song, only it's different 'cause it's LA instead of Vegas. But, you get the idea. (knocking on door) - Good. You're still here. What are you doing, making a living will? - Uh, yeah. No. Kind of. - Wow. When you decided to take up smoking you really committed to it. I got your message. I wanna go with you. - [Juliana] You do. - Well, it's not like I've got any pressing business here. Plus I got fired from the restaurant. I was out last night. That's why you got the machine. I was drinking dirty martinis, wallowing in self-pity. And when I got home there was your message blinking at me like a beacon in the night. I kept trying to call but this Russian guy kept answering the phone trying to get me to have phone sex with him. (laughing) - Yeah. That's Dimitri. He lives across the hall. Claims he used to be a czar from the old country. Real charmer. - Yeah. Ronnie's gonna baby-sit the apartment. So, can I come? I've got a car. That's gotta be a selling point. And if you're worried about me hitting on you, don't. The idea of unrequited love is kind of intriguing. - Hopeless romantic. - Hopeful. - You know what? I really need to go do this by myself. - Can I at least drive you to the airport? - Hmm, bus station. - Glamorous. Nothing like going in style. - By the way, you're a really good kisser. - [Vick] Yeah? - Yeah. I mean, if I, you know, played for that team, I'd definitely pick you. Well, it would be between you and Angelina Jolie. (laughing) So, aren't you even gonna ask me where I'm going, what I'm doing, why? - Nah, you're a smart girl. You'll figure it out. Can we please blow this pop stand? - Actually, I need to, uh, wait for somebody. To say goodbye. (sighing) - Prince Charming, no doubt. - Yeah. Prince Charming. (knocking on door) - It's for you, Julie. His name is Michael. - How'd you get this number? - I have my ways. I'm Batman. Wow. Not even a chuckle. Okay. I get it, you're mad. I was ill-behaved. But, you know, I've been doing some soul searching. I even miss the way your, the way you eat when your mouth is full. Come on, I'm being sappy. It's gotta be proof that I'm being sincere. Come on, please. You know I hate to beg. You know what I could do? I could stand outside your window with a boom box playing Peter Gabriel. - You've got a lot of issues, Michael. And I really hope you figure 'em out for your sake and, um, hmm. (chuckles) For the sake of every other woman in the greater Los Angeles area. It's been a slice, Michael. I gotta go. (chuckles) - Okay. I think you're being a little dramatic, don't you? Hello? Hello? - Hey. (light acoustic guitar music) - Hey. (laughing) - Hi. Wow. - Wow, uh, yeah, I have this all worked out in my head and now I'm completely blank. But, here goes. Okay. Last night I was, I was really confused and this person told me to ask for a sign. And I did. And right in that moment I saw this billboard and looked up and it was for Mentos, the fresh-maker, you know? (laughing) And I, uh, I thought of you. And I have no idea why a bad mint advertisement would make me think of you, but it did. I, I don't need some abstract, arbitrary sign to tell me what's been true all along. It should've been you. I mean, I've always been picked, you know. And then I just kinda went along for the ride. But if I got to pick, I'd choose you. Now, I know this is probably like a, a shock and surprise and I don't even know if you find me remotely attractive or completely hideous. Wow. That was... - Yeah. (clears throat) Phew. You know, I was wondering how long I was gonna have to wait for that a-and, uh, so I, I have a, uh, my, my white steed is, is parked out front. (laughing) - Yeah. Tempting. Um, but, but I actually gotta go. I have to, um, oh, this is cliche. I have to find myself, which I'm estimating will take about a year 'cause I'm an optimist. And, um, at the end of that year if, you know, you're still interested in this I was thinking we could meet at, um, where'd they meet in "Sleepless in Seattle?" - Empire State Building. - Hmm, right, though that seems a little melodramatic, impractical. - It's, it's far, yeah. - Far, yeah. - Yeah. - So, how about at the end of a year, uh, at the stroke of midnight we could meet at the, um, the Starbucks on the corner of Highland and Franklin. - Starbucks is very romantic.
