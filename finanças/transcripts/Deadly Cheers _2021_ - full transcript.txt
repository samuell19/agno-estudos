[soft, energetic music] [woman] vanessa! Vanessa, where are you? [intense music] We'll find you. Wherever you go, we'll find you. Vanessa... I'll find you. Vanessa, come back! [pom-poms rustle] [vanessa] I loved being captain of the wolf pack... Until I didn't. I couldn't remember how I got to the farm or why I was there. I just knew I needed to get away. I tried to run, I tried to hide, but... [screams] it was no use. And a few months later... [cheering, chanting] They replaced me with you. [cheering] I wish I could have warned you. [soft music] So much space. Isn't it great? A little too great. How are we gonna afford all this? [brianna] well, the starting salary for this assistant principal job at the school district's much better than the one back home. And I got a good deal. Motivated sellers. Motivated by what? [brianna] I don't know, divorce, financial problems? I mean, for once it's someone else's loss and my gain. That's not funny. [brianna] can you at least pretend to be excited? [julie] sure, it's great. When did we win the lottery, mom? How are we gonna afford all of this? Did you even think about that? Look, mom. I'm happy you got the new job. You worked so hard for this. Taking all those extra classes at night. And I know this place is better. For both of us. [sentimental music] When you get into college, I might actually be able to afford to send you. I just miss my friends is all. - I know, I'm sorry, baby. - It's okay. - Was kind of over 'em anyway. - Is that so? [julie] I mean, who needs friends when you have your own bathroom with two sinks? [brianna] mine has a jacuzzi tub and a tv. - No way. - Seriously, check it out. [julie] so, here's my new room. Some boxes I need to unpack. And here's my bed. [tina] oh my gosh, it is huge. Can I come live with you? I wish. How was practice today? [tina sighs] [tina] I mean, bad. We suck without you. Now show me your closet. [kelly] hey! Hello? Yo. Girl. Do you live here now? [julie] yeah, me and my mom, we just moved in and... [tina] what was that? My weird new neighbor, I guess. I found a pizza place with some decent reviews. They don't have meatballs though. Sausage? Okay, plain cheese it is. [tina] invie√± me over for pizza sometime. Is that you, tina? [tina] yes, love the new house, ms. Mckay. [brianna] did julie show you the pool? [tina] there's a pool? [julie] I gotta go. Talk later. [tina] bye. You should invite tina over to stay for winter break. It's only three months away. I'll get her a plane ticket so she doesn't have to drive. [phone dings] Oh, well, I don't know if this pizza will be any good, but it'll be here fast. [reflective music] All right, we got some pizza. [julie] it smells good. [brianna] it does smell good. - Able to get it down. - All right, so... [brianna] you have this one and I'll have this one. [julie] did you wash your hands? It's because I saw you scrubbing the floor. [dark music] [indistinct chatter] So, should we watch a movie tonight? Of course. What should we watch, what type of movie? Scary? [brianna] you know I can't do scary, honey. - Why not? - It's just too much on my conscience. I have way too much on my mind right now. [soft, tense music] That's where superintendent vargas said my office would be. So let's go. [brianna] okay, well, I guess it's over here, my name's on the door. Okay. [soft music] [cheerleaders chanting] Just put it on the floor, honey. [chanting continues] - Can I go look around? - Yeah, sure. Okay, I'll be back. Purple, black, white. Wolf pack, let's fight. [kelly] let's go again. - Purple, black, white. - Are you okay? You look like you're in distress. Do you need an adult or...? No, I, uh... um... Are those cheer tryouts? Um... [cheerleaders] purple, black, white. Sorry... I'm new. Couldn't tell. I'm messing with you. Come on, it doesn't matter that you're late. You know, with six state and 40 national titles, you would think we'd get a better turnout than this. Kelly, found another one. She was wandering the halls. Thank god, 'cause this is pathetic. [dark music] Do you live here now? She can't try out. Not only is she late, her outfit isn't workout approved. [lexi] I'm sure she'll probably change clothes. I said no. [julie] I don't think this is about my clothes. [allison] good morning, everyone. How are we doing today? Hi, what's your name? What position are you trying out for? Julie mckay, uh, tumbler, flyer. [allison] well, all right then. Let's see what you got, miss julie. [intense music] - Competition. - Oh, wow. [lexi] she tumbles better than the boys. - Wow, she's amazing. - She's got it. [lexi] woo! [ricky] she's amazing. [applause] [allison] looks like we just found our new baby cub. Practice is every day at 9:00 a.M. Sharp. - Don't be late. - Don't worry, I won't. [indistinct chatter] [dr. Russo] nice view, isn't it? I trust the accommodation is suitable. Well, for now. Your predecessor is still vacating. Principal russo. I recognize you from the school website. Yes, this will work just fine for now. [dr. Russo] superintendent vargas told me that this is your first year in administration. Yes, this is my first year as an assistant principal, but I have taught high school english and sociology for over 15 years, and I obtained my master's - and I... - I've read your resume. I just want to know if you're aware of why you, above all the highly qualified candidates that applied for this position, were selected. - I do. - Do tell. It was my thesis on the effects of trauma - on academic achievement. - Very impressive. Superintendent vargas seemed to believe that there was a need for some... Fresh insight here at wilson. Fresh insight, hm. I'm sorry if you were blindsided by my hiring. [dr. Russo] oh, please, please. [chuckles] - No. - Purple, black, white. The thing is, ms. Mckay... Wilson high school has a very lofty reputation to uphold. If you perused our website, I'm sure that was more than apparent. Your alumni are a list of very impressive athletes, olympians. The championships that this school has won are unmatched. [dr. Russo] then I'm sure you can imagine the powers at play in such a competitive environment. [julie] mom, mom, I made the cheerleading squad! Wait, what, they were having tryouts - this late in the summer? - Yeah, I guess someone dropped out and they had a spot to fill. [brianna laughs] [brianna] well, what did you do? [julie] just did some tumbling and stuff. [brianna] I'm sorry. Julie, this is ms. Russo, your principal. Dr. Russo. Congratulations to you, julie. You must be very good to make it onto our cheerleading team. I see the two of you will have no problem fitting in at wilson. If there's anything you need, please feel free to call my assistant. Thank you, dr. Russo. Dr. Russo. So, tell me all about it. So I had to tumble in my socks again. You're gonna break your ankles one of these days. - But I was fine. - You never listen to me. Mom, this? Again? [brianna] honey, that's from our trip to the beach together. Do you remember that? You were only like four years old and you peed right on the beach... Mom, okay, okay. [giggling] [cheerleaders] purple, black, and white. Wolf pack, let's fight! [allison] great practice, everybody. B squad, hit the track. Alpha squad, meet me in the gym in five. - Let's go! - Oh my god, it's julie. Julie, come here! - The queen herself. - Stop. [ricky] lexi can't stop talking about you. [lexi] it's like I was praying for her and she just walked right into our lives. We're gonna take nationals now for sure. What's her problem? Don't worry about kelly. We're really not supposed to talk about it. Coach is here. Good morning, everybody. - How are we doing? - The best ever! Wolf pack! [allison] I woke up with butterflies in my stomach this morning because I was so excited to get here and announce the newest member of our wolf pack, miss julie. I think she's gonna take us all the way. J-u-I-e! Julie! Julie! J-u-I-e! Julie! Julie! J-u-I-e! Julie! Julie! [cheering] [allison] so we have about an hour until I bring the rest of the team in. Let's run the routine from your ripple. So get into that formation. And we're gonna go full out. So, please do your jumps, your stunts, your tumbling. And give me smiles, yeah? All right, here we go. One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight. One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight. One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight. One, two, three, four, five, six... - Whoa, whoa, whoa. - My shoulder. [allison] safety first. Are you girls okay? [kelly] well, I'm not. Now, kelly, what do I always say? I'm gonna have to work on my confidence. K-e-I-I-y! Kelly! I don't need confidence! I need the new girl to lose 10 pounds. She almost dislocated my shoulder. [allison] whoa there, missy, you and I need to talk. Lexi, run the cooldown music. - That not okay. - You heard her, everyone. [ricky] it's not your fault. Kelly's shoulder was already injured. [lexi] do not listen to anything she says. The girl has some serious issues. I don't know what her problem is. She lives next-door to me. Wait, you moved into the house next-door to kelly? Yeah, why? Not right now, but I'll find time for us to talk about that later. Come with us to the farm? Wait, what's the farm? [lexi] sometimes, after practice, we'll go work on choreography, conditioning, that kind of thing. But two-a-day practices are illegal. That's why they call it choreography. [lexi] and do it off-campus. You're not some kind of like cheer narc or something, are you? 'Cause if you are, you have to tell me. - That's like entrapment. - No, of course not. Good, 'cause the administration of this school in insane. What happens in wolf pack cheer stays in wolf pack cheer. Absolutely, I would never say anything. [brianna] why won't you take... [cell phone ringing] How was your first day of practice? Mm. So did you do well or...? [julie] I'm just not in shape like I need to be. Honey, you'll get there. - I fell during a routine. - I'll be finished up here in a few and we can talk about it later. Um... Listen, lexi invited me over to her house to hang out and listen to music. Okay, sweetie, just don't stay out too late, okay? You have practice in the morning and you need your sleep. - Mom, I know. - I'm proud of you. - I love you. - Love you too, mom. [grim music] Which one do you think? We could do something like this. [cork pops, twinkling sound] Wait, oh my god. That's you? Yeah, and my best friend, tina, our team choreographer. [ricky] these moves are like so insane. We should have her come to wilson. - She would love that. - I'm gonna grab our bags. [julie] I mean, we don't have that many followers. Besides, it's over now. But that's okay. - I'm doing this. - True. Wolf pack is all-consuming. [kids cheering sound effect] [twinkling sound] [indistinct chatter] [lexi] julie, ricky, come here. Before we tell you anything about kelly or what happened, you have to promise you cannot tell anybody that we talked about this, okay? [ricky] but we have to tell you, obviously. - Yeah. - I promise. The house that you live in used to belong to vanessa. Who's vanessa? [lexi] she was the captain before kelly. She was an absolutely insane flyer. She was training to be, like, an olympic gymnast... Wait, I thought she was in the circus or something like that. No, same thing. It was big and it didn't work out, so her and her family all pick up from this podunk, middle-of-nowhere town that they live in and come here to try out for our squad. She made it, of course, and we end up winning state. [ricky] wolf pack state champs. Anyways, so, fresh out of state, bam, vanessa gets injured. Kelly was her base, dropped her. [lexi] and guess who gets made captain? Kelly... But why? She doesn't seem like a team player at all. [ricky] she's basically untouchable. - The administration is... - Can I tell my story, please? Okay, thank you. Anyways, so, vanessa, she's healing up, that girl's like made of steel. [ricky] well, so we thought. True, because when nationals does finally roll around, vanessa's nowhere to be found. [ricky] gone... Nobody can find her. And we lost... Of course. [lexi] she's missing, there's a whole investigation, the cops are going through all of her things. They find her diary. There's page after page of, "oh my god, my life is so hard. There's so much stress. Cheer is so difficult. My parents are so hard on me. I have to be the best all the time." - Ugh. - But don't be so mean about it. I mean, she did say how her real dream was to help sick animals. - And she was so sweet. - Whatever. Her parents sue the school. Wait, how do you know all of this? [lexi] my mom's firm worked on the case, so I know everything about it. So, school decides to settle out of court. The family takes the money and runs. That's it, they're probably out there with vanessa right now living the high life on our families' donations. Oh, no, I don't think that's true. [lexi] no, like my mom always says, cui bono, right? Who benefits? Yeah. The captain. [dark music] [solemn music] [engine roaring] [lexi] and there it is. [julie] no offense, but that kind of looks like something out of a horror film. You have no idea. [dogs barking] [allison] let's go, wolf pack! I expect you to show b squad how it's done. [cheerleaders] yes, coach allison! [allison] someone's always looking to take your place if you don't work for it. [r&b music] This is where we grow into champions. Don't grow too much. [allison] now, kelly, ain't nothing wrong with growth. We need to nurture our bodies with... Love! [allison] that didn't sound sincere. We need to nurture our bodies with what? - Love! - Yes. Good job, edgar, nice smile. - Can we get some smiles? - Yes, coach allison! [allison] 25, 26. Yes, good job, good form. Suicides, go! - Come on, lex. - Come on, lex. Good job, victoria. Go, lexi. Go, go, go, ricky, let's go! Push yourselves, guys, push yourselves! Come on, julie! - Great! - Finish strong, - finish strong, finish strong. - Come on, julie! [ricky] come on, julie! - Nice! - Okay. - Next time. - All right, guys, bring it in. [ricky] nice job, wolf pack. [allison] great job. I'm really, really proud of you, so keep pushing for the rest of the season. Yeah, maybe this isn't for you. You should probably quit now. [allison] you guys go home and get some rest now. [clapping] Go ahead, woo! Julie, will you help me clean up? [indistinct chatter] [soft music] Ms. Mckay. [brianna laughs] Superintendent vargas. It's so great to finally meet you in person. [vargas] I am glad I caught you before you left. - How is everything going? - Great. I mean, I don't quite have the computer system all worked out yet, but I figured out where everything is on campus, I sent out personal introduction emails - to all the teaching staff. - Okay, great. - And you feel welcome? - Mm, for the most part. Mm, russo. You mean dr. Russo. [superintendent vargas sighs] It's fine, I am just here for the kids, so... That is why I hired you, yes. And everything else, the move, all good? Thank you so much, by the way, - for your help with all that. - Don't thank me, thank my staff. I only hire the best. But if you need anything, you just ask, okay? - Okay. - It's great to meet you. You too. Coach, sorry I couldn't keep up today. Are you kidding? I know how rough this is, and you did amazing. I just wanted to say how blessed we are to have you on this team. I also wanted to make sure you felt comfortable here and welcomed. You know, kelly's outburst earlier was uncalled for and I talked to her about it. Her shoulder gives her pain and she doesn't really know how to cope with that. But if you have any issues, you please be sure to let me know. Okay, I will. But everything's been great so far. Um, I have some paperwork for you. [soft music] Wow, is that vanessa? [allison] uh-huh, and that's me. National champions that year. [julie] whoa, is that why you get diamonds? Captains get diamond eyes. A squad gets rubies. Anything is possible if you believe in yourself. You can be captain too. Just gotta work hard. I'll email you the team nutrition plan, okay? 'Cause we have to nurture our bodies with... Love. Oh, and your uniform. Only the best at wilson. We're gonna have to do a rush order if we want it here by homecoming. Honey... I get it. Let's just close our eyes and raise our arms, and we'll think happy thoughts. - Are you serious? - Yes, I'm serious. How 'bout you turn and you tell me about your first memory of tumbling. Okay. [seagulls calling, waves crashing] I was at the beach with my mom. She held my hands. I flipped right over her. I just did it. Thank you. All right. - Julie! - Oh! Looks like your ride is here. I'll get back to work and see you later, okay? - Okay. - Okay. [lexi] come on, let's go. [soft music] [julie] hey. [sighs] [cheerleaders] purple, black, white. Wolf pack, let's go. [energetic music] [vargas] don't you worry about allison. Your daughter is going to be on the best cheer squad in the country. Everything's topnotch here at wilson. I'm going to personally take really good care of her. [woman] looking chubby there, allison. Looks like we've got a gainer. Wanna put our best face forward, girls. - Gainer, gainer, gainer! - Run, fatty, run. [woman] run, you little fatty. Nobody likes a fat cheerleader. [vargas] I hear you're having a little trouble making weight, allison. [allison whimpering] I have something I could give you that could help with that. - Let's go. - Don't make me do it. - Don't make do it. - Why are you even trying out? - Why don't you come join us? - Again? [allison] I thought you said this was a yacht party. [vargas] party for two is much more fun, don't you think? [woman] wolf pack! [vargas] we count on you for a lot here at wilson. [allison] don't make do it. Don't make me do it. [vargas] gotta be a team player. [allison] don't make me hurt another cheerleader. [microwave beeping] Julie. Coming. - Food's ready. - Thanks, I'm starving. Look at what the school sent you. - Wow. - I guess they signed you up for some sort of meal plan subscription service. Riverford farms. It's good, right? Gotta nourish my body with love. [brianna] yeah, I hear ya. Can you believe that superintendent vargas came by to make sure I was doing okay? I mean, in all my years of teaching, I've never even spoken to a superintendent. I'm so happy we're here. It's like all of our hard times are finally over. [soft, tense music] [cheerleaders] j-u-I-e! Julie! Julie! J-u-I-e! Julie! Julie! J-u-I-e! Julie! Julie! J-u-I-e! Julie! Julie! [dark music] Go, julie! [vanessa] I tried to run, but I woke up in a dark room. [cheerleaders] go, julie! [vanessa] I wish I could have warned you. Help me. Help us. [disembodied scream] [brianna] jules, you ready? You ready? I'm gonna go make your shake, let's go. Coach allison's meal plan requires a protein shake every morning. Let's go, hurry up. [faucet flowing] [soft, dark music] Diamonds? Diamond eyes are for captains. Vanessa? The other one, I put it in here. [brianna] are you sure you didn't leave it at home? Why would I bring one shoe? - She didn't see me, did she? - No. It was bad enough when you were just an english teacher. Now you're assistant principal. Just write "leper" on my face. [brianna] yeah, but I'm the cool assistant principal. No, there's no such thing. Have a good day. Up! Don't forget your shake. Thank you. [lexi] hey, julie, you got some new moves for us? [julie] yeah, but, um, I'll tell you later. [lexi] is that a peanut butter protein shake? Those things are like so addictive. [julie] I know, they're like amazing. They're also super caloric, fyi. [lexi] kelly's just jealous because she's allergic to peanut butter. No, I just like to keep it 34/22/34. Tight. [dark music] [dr. Russo] can I help you? I'm having some problems logging into the student records page. That sounds like a district issue. Why don't you call the superintendent's office? I'm sure he can help. I'll do that. [indistinct chatter] [allison] okay, we're gonna run it again, and please remember the adjustments we made yesterday. All right, so we're gonna do it to music. Make sure you're sharp. Five, six, seven, eight. One and two and three and four. [energetic music] Sharp. Smile. - Yes. - Wait, stop, coach. Kelly's hurt. - I'm fine. - Are you sure? - That looks pretty painful. - I said I'm fine. [allison] maybe you should take a week off and let it heal. [kelly] let's run it, I'm fine. Listen to your body. It knows best. Yeah, and my body says it's fine. [dark music] I'm sorry, kelly. Safety first. Let's take a water break, and I need to talk to you... [indistinct chatter] I'm gonna go check on her. She's fine. - Wait. - Just a second. Kelly? Kelly? [dramatic music] What did you... what did you do? Coach! Coach! Coach allison! Coach allison, call 911! Kelly needs help. I don't know if she took something. She's unconscious. Come on. Grab the first aid kit. What happened? [julie] coach, she's over here. Come on, please. Coach, she's right there. Kelly! - Um, hand me the... - Oh my god, kelly! - Is she gonna die? - Shut up! The auto-injector, I need the auto-injector. [ricky] I don't... what? [girl] oh my god! [sobbing] [julie] shouldn't we call 911? [allison] don't call 911! We got this. Come on, kelly, you got this. Wake up. Well, thank you for taking my computer problem so seriously. Of course, brianna. I'll have it reach out to you first thing in the morning. Can you ask them to fix the vending machine too? - It stole my dollar at lunch. - No, no, no, no. Don't tell me you're eating vending machine food. Well, I tried the pizza in this town and... All right, I need to send you a list of some of our fine dining establishments. [julie] mom! Mom, I need you now. Kelly oded in the locker room. - Come on, call 911. - My daughter thinks - one of the cheerleaders oded. - All right, I'll be right there. [julie] mom, come on. - What's going on? - A cheerleader oded - in the locker room. - It was kelly. No, no, no, this is faster. [julie] she's over there. Kelly? Honey, honey, honey. Are you okay? [allison] let's give kelly and her mom some privacy. - Mom... That's her mom? - Julie said she oded. Are the paramedics on the way? - Who are you? - Brianna mckay. The new assistant principal. - I'm julie's mom. - Oh... Of course. I'm so sorry, I... Kelly had an allergic reaction to some nuts. Um, seems like she mistakenly drank - out of the wrong cup, but... - It wasn't that. [allison] fortunately, I was here to administer her epinephrine. It seems like she's doing a lot better. I'm just glad she's okay. It's fine. [allison] all right, squad. Come on, let's go. [dr. Russo] come on, honey, let's get you home. Here. - Mom, stop. - Drink this. Tell me what they did to you. Leave me alone. Dr. Russo? Are you sure I can't give you guys a ride to the hospital? [kelly] no, I just wanna go home. I'll be taking some personal time, all right? Yeah, of course. [dr. Russo] kelly... Come on. [cell phone ringing] Yes, I'm here. I just like to keep it 34/22/34. [trash rustles] [julie] naloxone? Everything good, sweets? - Yeah. - Just getting all your stuff? [julie] yeah. [footsteps retreating] Wolf pack, we need to send some healing vibes to our little alpha wolf kelly. [soft music] K-e-I-I-y. K-e-I-I-y. Kelly. Kelly's going to be taking some time off. In her place, someone demonstrated some amazing leadership skills during this crisis. And what do we say? A true alpha wolf always cares for their pack. [allison] that's right. That's why I would like to nominate... Julie as captain. [dark music] - Do I get a second? - I second. Great. Everyone, up. J-u-I-e. Julie, julie. J-u-I-e. Julie, julie. J-u-I-e. Julie, julie. [cheering] Wolf pack! Congratulations, julie. All right, I'll see you guys tomorrow bright and early, and please keep sending those positive vibes to kelly, okay? Hey, lexi, ricky. Hey! [ricky] I know kelly treated you like a bitch, but you didn't have to go and rat her out. - What are you talking about? - You know, accuse her of oding to your faculty mom. Thanks for mentioning that, by the way. [julie] sorry, I didn't. I don't know, I just... [lexi] cui bono, right? Who benefits? [ricky] yeah, captain. [julie] I didn't choose to be captain. No... You didn't. [brianna] hey, sweetie. Coach allison said she's gonna give you a ride home, okay? Principal russo has taken some personal time to be with kelly, and I really need to get up to speed on things, okay, all right? [allison] everything okay? Yeah, just... I'll tell you later. Okay. [soft, tense music] - Is she okay? - Yeah, I guess she's fine. I don't know, it seems like she just had an allergic reaction or something. She's with her mom and it feels like it's under control. Phew. Yeah, so, uh, principal russo says she needs to take some personal time. Of course, of course. Um, did she say anything about where she was on the schedule with opening up the campus? - We have... - 15 days. Fifteen days. Look, I'm sure if we just take five minutes... Or a couple of hours and put together a list where we can figure out where we are, we'll be fine. - We'll be ready for opening day. - You know what? I've been on my feet all day. Do you mind if we make this a working lunch? I mean... Dinner? Yeah, sure, just let me get my laptop. No, no, no, you know what? Let's eat first. I'll drive. Come on. Fifteen days, that means orientation has to be the number one priority. They're laying down the new track next week. Don't have to worry about that. They know what the first day of school is. - Ah. - Is that...? Are you seeing what I'm seeing? Vargas, you dog. The new girl's here and he's already after her mom. It took him like five seconds. Wow. Can't wait for julie to see that. That would break her. If we lose nationals because of him... [sighs] He's gonna get a bullet in his head. That's for sure. Lexi and ricky just accused me of ratting out kelly to my mom for being on drugs. Heavens no! I'll have a talk with them. No, it'll only make it worse. We have a strict no-bullying policy on this squad. What happened to kelly... Was an accident. I'm not crazy. I saw the naloxone. It's what you give someone when they've oded on painkillers. [allison] you're right. I am so sorry. I wasn't thinking in the moment. I was just trying to save kelly. I wanted to make sure she was all right. She just lost her best friend. [julie] her best friend? Vanessa. Vanessa? They were friends? [allison] they were inseparable. She was the first person on the squad that could really relate to kelly. You know... Kelly is from this town, but she's not like the other kids here. Her mom works for the school. Earned talent like hers, like yours... It makes these kids uncomfortable. If it got out that kelly has a substance abuse issue at this school, the kids, her parents, all of the parents, will destroy her future. And they'll laugh about it over iced lattes. I could see that. Trust me, I know. It happened to me my senior year. One little mistake and, poof, all of my hopes and dreams just gone. I see why you want to protect her, but she needs real help. I am so proud of you. You are a true alpha wolf, julie girl. Coachin' the coach. I'll talk to her mom, okay? I am going to make sure kelly's safe, okay? Safety first, right? [dark music] [birdsong] [vargas] I hope you're a meat eater. - Definitely. - Good, because their fillet is to die for, all locally sourced. [brianna] well... [elegant music] Oh. The riverfords are the biggest donor to our athletic department. The staff eats here for free. Oh, right, riverford farms, the meal plan service. Yes, well, that's one of their many ventures, but, uh, wilson high school remains their top priority. [indistinct soft chatter] [waiter] good afternoon, ladies. Are you enjoying your meal? Brianna, you play billiards? - I do. - You any good? Some might say. - Mr. Vargas? - Yes. - I have your table ready. - Perfect, thank you. Go ahead. So many choices. - The fillet? - Good choice. Oh yeah... I'll have the same. [sighs] What a day it's been. Indeed. To a new school year. [glasses clink] You see why we need changes. Wilson is the athletic magnet in this area. We attract students with amazing talents from all over. They place such high demands on themselves. The stresses, the needing to win at all costs. I understand. I understand as well. I also was an athlete. - Did you partake in athletics? - Yes, I was a cheerleader, uh, high school, college. Well, that's where julie gets it. And you must get what I'm saying. Children like your daughter, they're not like other kids. We need to level the playing field. Principal russo thinks they need extra test prep and homework. It's just too much. Mm, you want a soft touch? Look, I just need to know that we're on the same team. Last year, we had a student, vanessa... That had a psychiatric breakdown. [clears throat] It was russo's academic hardline that caused it. Oh my god... That's horrible. Yep. And after I read your thesis, the traumatized children and academic performance... All I could do was think of that student. So you think athletic training and competition is traumatic? It can be. I think when we don't hear the children and what they're saying, and when we, and the parents, pretend that they're just playing a sport and not committing to something that they're passionate about. Sports equals passion. And I am rambling again. - Anyways, enough of that. - No, that's fine. I think it's important to take at least an hour a day to... Let it all go. Let my defenses down. As the cheer squad says... Nurture your body with love. That's it. That's what we're gonna do. Nurture our body with love... And a little wine. [brianna laughs] In theory, I agree, but I have yet to fully adapt that practice into my life. Honestly, I don't even know if I... if I know how to start. As I tell my students, you already have. Yes, this... this is a start. - Yeah. - Yeah. Ah, the riverfords are here. Oh. Brianna, correct? I just wanted to say what a pleasure it is to have you here, um, part of the wilson family. - Thank you very much. - Lexi, say hello. - Hello. - Lexi, I've heard so much about you. My daughter, she loves you. Thank you so much for making her transition so much easier. [lexi] of course. [giggles] Would you mind if I stole mr. Vargas for a few moments? - By all means. - Okay. Won't be long. [footsteps retreating] [clears throat] I come home and lexi informs me that this new girl julie is saying kelly overdosed on drugs. - Oh god. - I think I speak for the other parents when I say that after the vanessa debacle, we're all a little... Insecure. This is the second position I've financed on the squad to try to replace that nightmare kelly and actually get some of the big titles that we deserve this year. That kelly is chronically injured, not to mention her mother, that nightmare of a principal, trying to claim that my lexi didn't earn those test scores that we got for her. [vargas] kelly is a bad apple, no doubt, and, uh... She is gone for good. Okay? Coach allison assures me that julie has the flying and tumbling talents to lead us to nationals, and just so you know... Brianna is definitely on board with our academic philosophy here at wilson. I'm a senior, so this is my last chance to get a national title, and I'm starting to think that maybe you aren't the man to take us there. Wow, is that so, lexi? Well, guess what? Everything is going according to plan. Well, that's great, because I want to talk to you about another position. [gentle music] We want the tina girl too. Whatever you want. Call allison. She'll make it happen. I hope you both enjoy the rest of your evening. [phone chiming] [car approaching] Thank you so much for the ride. Of course! Oh, I almost forgot. [glove compartment opening] So it's official. Captain. Oh my god. I don't know what to say. [mellow music] Put it on. Being captain can be a thankless job. It's important to have a little reminder of how strong you need to be. Strong as diamonds? [chuckling] like my grandma used to always say, it's not always sunshine and roses, but... I see that strength in you. - Thank you. - You're welcome. [door opens] [phone ringing] [door closes] - Hello? - Hi, allison. Lexi tells me that the tina girl is a good choreographer. [allison] I have the choreography department covered. Oh, sweetheart, don't kid yourself. I need you to make an offer. Of course, ms. Riverford. [grim music] [engine starting] [birds chirping] [knocking] Can I come in? Yeah. Oh, what's that smell? - My food. - Oh my god. - Are you okay? - No. [mellow music] [breathing heavily] You're not either... Captain. [julie] found these from when I sprained my ankle last summer. Ibuprofen 500. [kelly] does your mom have anything stronger? [julie] sorry, my mom doesn't use that kind of stuff. - Can I borrow your phone? - Yeah. It's dead. [she groans] I found your ring. You left it in your locker. - Get that away from me. - Fine. I guess I have a collection now. Where'd you get that? [julie] found it in the sink drain in my bathroom. [solemn music] It's vanessa's, isn't it? Yeah. - What happened to her? - I don't know. [phone dings, ringing] - Hey! - Wait, let me pull over. - Where are you? - I thought something happened to you, so I took my grandma's car and I... I just drove. Have you checked our cheer account? - My phone was dead. - It's horrible! There's hundreds of comments. The worst one is "flexilexi." I tried reporting them, but... They won't stop. [julie] "I can't decide who's uglier or fatter." "Who let them on a squad?" "They're so embarrassing." Told you, they're animals. - Who's there? - It's kelly. She's not involved. Honestly, I just wanna go back to my old school. I hate this. [tina] have you told your mom? [notifications chiming] No. Oh my god, I think it's my mom. [dramatic music] - I gotta go. - Can you go check? - I gotta go. - Don't tell her I'm here. [notifications chiming] [vargas] so I think that puts an end to the pizza place after going there. [sighs] You got enough to eat? That was... Dinner was great. - Is that my mom? - No, but... It is my mom, and it looks like she found a new boyfriend. That's no boyfriend. That's vargas. We didn't get any work done, but... Oh, that can wait till tomorrow. Hmm, I didn't read you as a procrastinating type. Oh, I'm not. Seriously, it's always been my problem. [bright music] Yeah, I thought you were the fast type. Just covered in red flags, huh? [birds chirping] You're my boss. - And, so? - And you don't seem to care. You are way too smooth. [he laughs] You're amazing. You have no idea. Call you tomorrow? [julie] the superintendent, really? - What? Nothing happened. - Oh, but it's gonna. I've been holding back from telling you how bad I want to go home because I know how hard you worked to get here. But you know what? Why bother? You're gonna mess this up all on your own. [brianna] what is going on with you? [solemn music] You seem to be enjoying cheerleading. Coach allison said you were fitting in so well. You're happy, taking care of yourself, eating well. Oh my god, I can't even talk to you! [brianna] what? I can't say that you're doing well? [julie] don't let me ruin the last glimmer of hope you have left for me. See, it's the way you look at me, like you're chronically disappointed. Julie, where is this coming from? Why am I never enough? Why is it my entire life, I... Me... could never make you happy? [sniffles] Nothing can be further from the truth, julie. You needed the bigger house, the better job, the better man. I was there for you! I supported you! Six years of night school, all the bad break-ups, the moves, for what? I was finally happy at my old school. Honey... Things haven't been easy, I know that, but... It's gonna be different now. [julie] it's not gonna be different. Something bad keeps happening to the cheer captains here, and coach allison and your new boyfriend are a part of it. [brianna] that's not true. Julie! Julie! [julie] I'm going to find out what happened, mom. Julie, get back here! [knocking] - Julie. - No! - Julie, let's talk. - Just leave me alone! [door opens] You don't look too good. Yeah... I don't feel too good. You need to go to a doctor. I know, I know. Can you help me get my car? Yeah, of course. I just need a sec. [sighs] [indistinct sports news broadcast] [soft footsteps] [door softly closes] [door closes] [tense music] [vargas] we need to take care of kelly. [susan] this is the last time. I wouldn't ask if it wasn't important. [susan] you don't need to keep supplying her with painkillers now that she's useless to us. All right, gotta get going. Leave it to me, okay? [camera clicks] I'll take care of her. Oh, well, good evening, allison. - You reach the tina girl? - Yes, but, um, seems like that's not gonna be a possibility, unfortunately. Make a better offer. I think we'll be fine for nationals. Julie is an unbelievably talented tumbler and flyer. If we properly utilize her skills, we'll annihilate the competition. That is my point. We need a better choreographer to properly utilize her skills. Yes, well... If you want to protect your investment, susan, or win nationals, lexi, then the constant bullying and gossip needs to stop. The wolf pack is a family, and you both seem to forget that. [susan] you better have proof if you are accusing my daughter of any improprieties. You are just as replaceable as the rest of them. I monitor everyone's social media. "Flexilexi," I saw the horrible things that you, ricky, and your little crew left on julie's page. [allison scoffs] Disgusting. [lexi] that's not true! I don't know what she's talking about. [allison] for your sake, I hope that all those elite educational institutions you've applied for don't find out about this abusive hatred. I mean, that would just absolutely ruin your life. [sighs] Christin. [christin] yes, mrs. Riverford? [susan] more of this, sweetie. I'll take what she's having. Oh, that's fine. [sighs] Julie! Julie, julie! - Let's go! - Kelly! What the hell are you doing here? - Kelly, get out of the car! - I said I'm not going! Get out of the car! [dramatic music] - What the... - Go, go! [dark music] Make a left here. Here. This doesn't look like a doctor's office. [doors opening] [doors closing] Stay with him. I'll be back. Give me the keys. - I'm not gonna ditch you. - Give 'em! Go. - Julie, right? - Yeah. Brianna's daughter, correct? Get up here! Your mom has been a life-saver the last two days. Wonderful woman. Do you want anything. [car door closes] - I'm good. - You sure? All right, take a seat, take a seat. You sure you don't want anything? - I'm good. - You're okay? All right. Are you in pain like kelly? - No! - Oh, good. That's... That's very good. I know they run you girls ragged. Wilson demands so much from their athletes. Trust me, I know, I was one at wilson. [he sighs] I'll tell you what. If you girls win nationals, I've got a big yacht we can party on. Have you ever been on a yacht? - No. - Oh, it's incredible. You're gonna have the best time. Have you been up to the country club yet? - Have you seen it? - No. [vargas] oh my god, you need to see the golf course at night, the way they light it up. You gotta ask kelly. I've taken her so many times. She absolutely loves it. She loves my yacht parties too. Okay. Let's go. [vargas] hey, what is this? I thought you girls were gonna stick around, we were gonna have some fun. No, gotta go. But my mom is gonna be looking for me all night. Could I have some money for a hotel? Yeah, sure. Whatever you need. [money crinkling] Here you go. Have fun tonight. [car doors opening] [doors closing] [engine starting] [car driving away] You are unbelievable. Nothing ever changes with you, does it? Oh, my god! Save the preaching. [allison] when I came to wilson high school, I thought my life was going to change. You sat in my mom's living room and told me I was gonna be on the best cheer squad in the country. And guess what? You were. Because I made it the best! I led that squad of mediocre rich kids to a national title. There's no "I" in team. Then why did they all go off to their elite universities while I stayed here with no high school education, a drug felony, and no hope out of this town? You made some bad personal choices, allison. What can I say? Happens to the best of us. [allison] and you and your little yacht parties had nothing to do with that? I was a kid. You're an animal. Don't you ever wonder if any of this is gonna come back to you? You're gonna rat me out? Blackmail me? Your hands are dirty, too, and since you brought it up, I thought the kelly situation was a liability. Let's just say... She's gonna be on a long list of wilson high school tragedies, just like our little vanessa. Do you miss her, huh? I don't! But it seems like you want to be on that list too. Is that right? [whimpering] No, I promise. Please, just let me go. Please. I'm not gonna say anything. [music intensifying] Please. [panting] [he snickers] [soft music] You are psychotic. I know. [ominous music] But you... Make me that way. [he chuckles] [he screams] [intense music] [gasping] [panting] [wheezing] [allison] and five, six, seven, eight. And hit, hit. Come on, girls, let's go. Hit, full out. Go seven, hold eight. Cradle. Come on, wolf pack, let's go! We got this! [electronic dance music] Three, hit, hit. Yes. [music fading] [dreary music] Is vargas the reason you wanted to quit? He's about to become your new best friend, captain. [julie] did he do something to vanessa? Probably. I thought she was your friend. You can take that ring off. Once a captain, always a captain. There's no escape. They own us now. Are you sure you're okay to drive? Whoa, whoa, whoa! [skidding] [glass shattering] Kelly? Kelly! Kelly... Where's my... where's my... - No. - But you're hurt. We have to get you to a hospital. [words echoing] Coach allison. She knows what to do. [phone dialing] [coughing] [allison] hello? Julie? Julie! Coach allison, we need help. [panting] [dark music] - Are you hurt? - Uh, no, just a tiny bit. - But kelly's really hurt. - Oh, honey. [julie] I never should've gotten in the car with her. - My mom's gonna kill me. - Damn it, kelly! What the hell are you still doing here? I'm not going to rehab. I can't leave vanessa. Vanessa is gone, and you need to watch what you're saying before we all end up just like her. She needs to know the truth. [tense music] We're not at riverford farms tonight. - Do you understand me? - Yes. I'm gonna take you home. You're gonna tell your mom and anyone who asks that she wanted to hang out with boys, but you went home instead and... But, coach, kelly's hurt. We need to take her to the hospital. We need to call 911! - We can't call... - We can't do this! Of course. You're right, okay? Help me get her in the car, and we'll take her to the hospital. Okay, let's go, come on. Okay. [doors closing] [grunts, smacks] Ooh, pitching prospect arrested with 20 pounds of cocaine in duffel bag. "Pitching hopeful jackie vargas, 20, is led off by police after a drug raid at hotpants nightclub." Wow, vargas. I didn't pick you as that fast, jeez. [knocking] [door opens] Kelly? I know she's here. Kelly, get down here now! What? What are you doing? Kelly, don't mess with me! Kelly? [solemn music] Kelly! [phone dialing] She's not picking up, I don't... Julie? This is my daughter's ring. I don't know where she is. I didn't even know she left the house. Julie? Call me, now. I promise you, she's a good girl. [dr. Russo] that's what they all say. I go watch kelly at practice just to make sure she's alive. She won't even talk to me. [whimpering] God knows where she sleeps at night. They've got her hooked on drugs, I know it. [phone ringing] - Tina? - Hey, ms. Mckay. Is julie there? I'm on my way. [brianna] you're on your way? What do you mean? What's going on? We can't find kelly or julie. [tina] didn't she tell you? Somebody or somebodies left hundreds of threatening comments on our cheer videos. What is going on at this school? I just did a little recon on vargas, and now this? You have no idea. Vargas made the last captain disappear. [dramatic music] [wheezing, whimpering] [vanessa] nurture your body with drugs. Morning practices at the school, hours of training at the farm. That meal plan? A dinner to make you sleep and a shake to wake you up, and nurture your body with drugs. [allison] there's no "I" in team. [breathing heavily, whimpering] [echoing voices, screaming] You're gonna be safe now. [words echoing] Where am I? I'm keeping you girls safe. Safety first, right? Is kelly okay? Oh, kelly's a trooper. It's you I'm more concerned about. You are much more sensitive than kelly. You were such a good find. [dark music] Scouting social media, I thought of that. You know, your tumbling, ahh. Your body not trashed by drugs yet. What are you talking about? I moved here 'cause my mom got a job here. [kelly] no. Your mom got the job 'cause they wanted you. They wanted my mom out. [allison] when that whole lawsuit business happened with vanessa, they knew that they needed to find families that they could better integrate with the wolf pack family. A parent with a sweet job in the school administration. Staff is just so easy to keep on the same team. You'd know. [allison] and you know your friend tina, jules? She's so good. They want her, too, but... I am not gonna let them take away another one of these young ladies. - You're a traitor, allison. - No, you are! I invested a lot in you, kelly. You know, I trained her since she was wee big. So talented, but then one little injury and she gets hooked onto painkillers that vargas gave her. You're supposed to nurture your body with love, kelly, not poison. It's okay, baby. Vargas is gone. I made sure he won't hurt any more cheerleaders. I'm gonna take the pain away. Wait, I have something for you. [door creaking] [door closes] [groaning] [brianna] "who let them on the squad?" "A waste of life." Tina, I'm... I'm so sorry. [tina] I tracked down one of the accounts, "flexilexi," to the name lexi riverford. Let me see if I can get a number or email attached to the account. Lexi and her crew bullied my daughter into a person I don't even recognize anymore. That's why vargas wants me gone. Because I wasn't down with letting parents like the riverfords buy grades. [brianna] so that's what he meant by, "we need to level the academic playing field." Make wilson a safe space for gifted athletes who need individualized attention. [groans in disgust] More like keep your mouth shut while he gets paid to commit academic fraud. [brianna] figures. I wondered why I was locked out of the student accounts. I'm sorry I thought it was you. I'm sorry. Money buys a lot of power in this town. Yeah. It's hard to trust anyone. You can trust me. [tina] I'm sending a number. It is linked to those accounts. - Okay. - Oh, wait. Even though her phone location isn't coming up, check her workout app. She keeps it on all the time. It'll show you the last place that she was at. All right. Um, okay, it looks like they were at riverford farms, and then it stopped at riverford road, 57 minutes ago. Oh my god. Let's go. [tense music] [door creaking] let's go, vanessa. Game plan. [shaky breathing] [groaning] [tense music] [tearing] Kelly? [door creaking] Vanessa? [dripping] [door closing] [keys jingling] Set that down over there. My little runaways. I get it, I wanted to run away, too, but I had to stay here and make sure you guys were safe, so you owe me this, especially you, kelly. You had your chance to leave, but you didn't. I'm going to take down wilson high once and for all. So we're going out in a bang, girls. I have a video I wanna show you. Me and vanessa have been working on this dance, and we almost got it down, right? Come on, guys, get up! This is going to be the most epic wilson high school tragedy ever, too big for even the riverfords to cover up. Here, I'll get some pom-poms. You guys want poms? [upbeat dance music] last practice, okay? Five, six, seven, eight. One, two, ta, ta... [car rumbling] [phone dialing] [phone ringing, groans] [upbeat dance music] Buzzkill, hold on. - Hey, who's this? - This is julie's mom. I'm calling for flexilexi. This is about the comments you left on my daughter's social media page. Yes, this is lexi, and I don't know what you're talking about. Um, I'm really busy right now studying, so you're gonna have to call my lawyer, a.K.A. My mom. Coach allison, is that you? What the... I have no idea what's going on. [brianna] I do, she's a cheer coach. [allison] change of plans, practice is cut short. Man, sometimes you just have to improvise, you know? Don't let the judges see your mistakes. So we need... To finish big, finish strong, finish sharp, full out just finish big! [groaning] [fire whooshing] [dramatic music] [groaning] [breathing heavily] [punches, groaning] - Oh my god. - Okay, wait, what's this? - Oh my god. - That's kelly's car. - No! - Stop the car, stop the car. [tense music] Oh my god, they're not here. - Let's go. - Julie! [dramatic music] [kicks, groans] [fire roaring] [smacking, groaning] [keys jingling] [door creaking] Oh my god! [groans] [tires screech, thud] [mellow music] [flames crackling] [groans] [grim music] [groaning] [breathing heavily] [explosion] Oh my god. [explosions rumbling] [mellow music] [sirens wailing] [firetruck horn blaring] [kelly] well, I'm off to rehab. Can we hang when I get back? [bright music] [vanessa] I tested positive for performance-enhancing drugs at a club cheer meet. I knew the school was drugging me. I was still gonna do nationals. I was gonna quit after and tell the team why. Kelly and her mom used to drive me to practice. - Have fun! - Thanks, love you! [vanessa] but not that day. Hey! Good morning, sweetie. [solemn music] I got your favorite. [vanessa] that's the last thing I remember... Before I woke up in a dark room. [allison] vanessa? They'll find you, vanessa. [words echoing] [vanessa] I tried escaping. It was... It was no use. [door creaking] It's okay, you're safe now. Thanks. [indistinct radio chatter] [birds chirping] [mellow music] [door closes] This is so weird. This is still your home. Okay. You can stay here as long as you like. Julie... Vanessa, do you want to go to your room, take a shower and get cleaned up? Yeah, thanks. [ominous music] [gentle music] It, uh, pretty much looks the same as when I lived here. Really? I imagined whoever lived in this big old fancy house probably had a bunch of nice furniture and cool clothes. [chuckling] - No. - Are these okay? Yeah, yeah, these are perfect. I'll go get you some clean socks or something. Awesome, thank you. [whimpering] - Julie! - Oh, you need a towel? - Shh, shh. - Are you okay? - Are you okay? - Yeah, yeah. [dark music] We need to talk. Mom? [yelps] - Mom? - I'm okay, baby, I'm okay. [breathing heavily] Hey, girls, get out. It's okay, go sit down. I'm glad that we're all here for this little chat. [brianna] let the girls go. You and I can go and talk about this like adults, okay? We're all adults here. Isn't that right, ladies? [brianna] they don't need to be here, vargas. You and I can go talk about this. When the feds called this morning wanting to speak to me about coach allison's unfortunate demise, I had to make sure we were all on the same page. So excited to find tina waiting outside for you. We've got big things planned for you, girl. I've been making champions and breaking champions at wilson high school for a long time. That's why the riverfords and families like them keep me here, because I make them happy. Trust me when I say to you... You don't want to make the riverfords unhappy. - Isn't that right, vanessa? - Go to hell. You're just their little bitch boy who will do anything to get up top. - Oh, no, no, no. - We went a whole year without you; We can go one more. I'm assuming you and kelly blabbed to the feds about the medication I was facilitating to her, huh? You know what, shut up, shut up. Kelly I could care less about. She's a degenerate drug addict, and her mom is a spiteful bitch who's mad about being replaced. But you, julie, and you and you, we've got a real opportunity here. I mean, if it means getting in on some of the riverford money, I'm down. [vargas laughs] How much cash we talkin'? Right? Are you girls in? [vargas] you raised a smart girl here. [brianna] she's always been very practical. I can arrange ample compensation with the riverfords, but I need all of you to recant anything you said to the feds involving me or the riverfords. The drugs, vanessa's kidnapping and disappearance, everything falls on coach allison, we got that? - Yeah, yeah, fine. - Loud and clear. [vargas] because with the three of you, I believe wilson's wolf pack cheer is looking to have the best year ever! Hey! [smacks] [brianna] get back, get back, get back. - Oh my god. - Did we get it? [tina] yeah! Over 10,000 people are watching. - What? - Make that... Oh my god, make that 30. [laughing] Make that 55! Thank you. - Oh my gosh, we're saved. - I'll tell kelly's mom. [laughing] [lexi] ready? Okay. [clapping] Purple, black, white. Wolf pack, let's fight. Purple, black, white. Wolf pack, let's fight. [dramatic music] [officer] lexi riverford? Lexi riverford, you are under arrest for conspiracy to commit fraud. I... I'm not a criminal. I'm captain of the cheer team. I didn't do it. You're gonna have to call my mom, she's my lawyer. All right, girls, grab your poms. Let's get into cheer formation for wolf pack. All right, from the top, here we go. Six, seven, eight. One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight. One, two, three, four, five, six... Wolf pack! [bright music] Do you know who I am? [cheerleader] seven, eight. Go one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight. Nice, one, two, three, four, five, six... Wolf pack! [julie] five, six, seven, eight. Wolf pack!
