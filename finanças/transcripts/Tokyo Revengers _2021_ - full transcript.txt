You protect Tachibana! What are you... This sounds crazy but listen! I die 10 years from now then time travel back to my high school days It sounds unreal but you and Hinata are gonna die on July 1, 2020 In a truck accident involving the street gang called Tokyo Manji Gang - Street gang? - Listen! You protect Tachibana! Unfortunately... I just see it on the news Pitiful, huh? What am I talking about? This is a flashback... I'm in love with your sister I'm crazy about her I remember now She really sees me A poor loser like me What are you saying? Just remember! 10 years from now on July 1 I'm off to my next flashback now I'm counting on you Are you OK? He's awake - Did I die? - You're alive I'm alive? I survived? And died? - I'm alive! - Yes! This detective rescued you just in time Long time no see, Takemichi Naoto! Why are you wearing a suit? Is this a flashback? What year is this? Where am I? July 2, 2020 You wet yourself a little, that's all No way... But why are you alive, Naoto? I knew it In the world you know I'm supposed to be dead "In the world I know"? What the hell is that? On July 2, 2010 you appeared and prophesied that my sister and I would die 10 years later Wasn't that a flashback? You travelled back in time Somehow I survived and was able to rescue you Time travel? I should've died yesterday Yeah. I saw it on the news But you warned me and here I am You changed my destiny I believed you that day and became a detective To protect my sister So...is Tachibana alive too? She died I couldn't change that How did you survive then? Ow! I warned her many times but she wouldn't believe me! I don't blame her She knew nothing about Toman! Ow, that hurts... It's going to hurt a lot more What do you mean? Did you forget what you said? Toman is responsible for my sister's death! Sorry... You can't even kill one lousy person You haven't progressed at all in 10 years That's her pet goldfish from 10 years ago She won it at the festival you both went to I adopted it Back then, Toman was just a street gang Now they're a powerful crime organization They developed drug routes and are behind many unexplained deaths in recent years Even the police can't pin them down This is insane... Who's this? Manjiro Sano Tokyo Manji Gang's leader and... Tetta Kisaki another key player Manji wouldn't be what it is today if these two had never met I called you because I want you to travel back in time again Are you crazy? Shaking hands with me seems to be the key Remember our handshake 10 years ago? At that moment, your essence disappeared No way... Your mission is to return to high school and stop Sano and Kisaki from meeting They met in July 2010 I'm going home Takemichi! I can't do it! I can't! What do you expect from a loser like me? I believed in you 10 years ago! It's your turn to trust me! The next time you return I believe my sister will be alive Hinata Tachibana... Alive... Once you complete your mission shake my hand and come back I'm telling you, I don't think I can do it - Not a loser like me - Takemichi You can change destiny What day is it? You OK, Takemichi? Akkun, Makoto, Takuya, Yamagishi So I'm really here Of course you are We have no right to refuse Why? It's a gladiator match sponsored by Toman That's right! I remember now Kiyomasa forced us to fight... Next match! From Mizo High, Takuya! From Shibuya High Kishino! Can you fight, Takuya? You're kind of sickly, right? I'll avenge you - Buy me a beef bowl later... - Let's go! Takuya I wanna fight in his place But if we defy Kiyomasa, we're dead I have to do this Do what, Akkun? Look at that Akkun stabbed Kiyomasa on July 7 We'll never laugh again as long as you're alive... What day is it? The 7th We should be at the fireworks festival Akkun, don't do it... Takemichi How did you know? Go back I'll take care of this Stop this match! What do you think you're doing? These matches are getting boring Kiyomasa! King versus slave Fight me You talking to me? I don't see any other lame kings around here! Takemichi... Move! Has he lost his mind? Kiyomasa, you belong to Toman, right? If I win introduce me to Manjiro Sano You punk! How dare you call his name? You die. Right now Takemichi! You can run and beg forgiveness all your life but you'll still be a worthless piece of shit Then be a man And be with me 10 years from now Takemichi! Enough! Mr. Kiyomasa! I'll fight! - Takemichi! - Don't do it You guys need to shut up For the first time in my life I ain't running away Shut up, all of you! If I win... I wanna meet Manjiro Sano You... Someone! Bring me a bat! Stop, Takemichi! - Takemichi! - You'll die! Enough! Give it up! I can't! I can't give up now! There's a reason why I can never give up Give me the bat! Fine You'll have to kill me to win Yo, Kiyomasa You lost your audience It's him! It's the boss! The big boss? No, that's Draken, the #2 The small one's the boss. Mikey The leader of Toman? Remember this angle when you bow to the boss Yes, sir... Your head's right in the strike zone Wanna see what happens if I use this? My apologies! Your name? Takemichi...Hanagaki I see Takemitchy Takemitchy From today, we're buddies! What? What Mikey says goes Right Takemitchy? So who's in charge here? Gladiator matches are stupid Don't disgrace Toman's name! We're sorry! What, Boss? Kenchin, I dropped my bean bun - It's still good! - The 3 second rule! - Pick it up! Hurry! - Go buy a new one! Don't call me Kenchin See ya, Takemitchy That's Manjiro Sano... Is our life of slavery over? It's over! Lie down here. Just do it From today, you're Takemitchy What Mikey says goes. Right? - It wasn't like that - Stupid Thanks... I wet my pants a bit, though You were so cool Takuya You were so cool What? - Nothing - Were you copying me? I wasn't copying you This fight was too much Nah, he just bashed my head into the railing, that's all Railing? Why do you have to fight day after day? I'd like to live in peace, too She's so cute!! Life was good 10 years ago! Why don't I just stay here? She's my girlfriend... I wish I was a guy What? Then I could protect you No, I'll protect you, Hina I can't imagine a world without you So I'll protect you You called me Hina... Yeah. First-name basis I... was a real loser until now I ran away from trouble and apologized whenever But I... Naoto! Naoto! You came back I didn't mean to shake your hand So my theory was correct What date and time did you return to? July 7th. Around 5 pm And you shook my hand... Around 8 pm? What's going on over here? I knew it. It all makes sense So what happened to me? When you went back in time you were fast asleep, like in a coma Suspended animation It seems you can travel back to the same day and time as now So if you travel back in time today it'll be 10 years ago today If you stay a week you'll return to this world a week later too I'll be fired from my job Who cares? My sister's life is on the line What about your mission? I met Mikey - Mikey? - Manjiro Sano, head of Toman That was fast... But I haven't met Kisaki yet Forget Kisaki But he can't meet Sano, right? Kill Sano If Manjiro Sano dies they'll never meet Then my sister will live It's simple But I can't... How much damage have they done? The head of Manji killed my sister Does he deserve to live? Kill Mikey? How am I supposed to do that? Think outsiders can just walk in here and leave alive? Mikey? There you are, Takemitchy! Hey. Watch your back Let's go, Mikey I'm bored, Takemitchy Let's go play Out of our way, trash They're carpet, Kenchin Congratulations! You've just been promoted Line up...

Anything Just getting my shoes on Hurry up Wait a minute! Hina... Who are you? What was that for...? Why are you taking him? He's not going with you Let's go - Hina, this is... - It's OK I'll protect you Slap him and walk away? Are you kidding me? I'm dead serious I'm 100% serious about Takemichi Your hand... Please let her go Can't hear you Hina's shaking Let her go, idiot You're shaking too So what? I promised to protect her! I won't give up Not this time I see I thought we could be buddies So? How do you wanna die? Promise me one thing Don't lay a finger on Hina Takemichi... Says who? Faked you out! Ow! You think I'd beat up a girl? "I won't give up!" Who says that over a girl nowadays? Old school guy, huh? I didn't say that! - You did - No, I didn't You were cool Thanks Um! You're Takemichi's friends? Sorry! I misunderstood! Maybe you did Can we borrow him for a minute? Please do I'm going back to class - Bye - What about me? - You come with us - No... She slapped Mikey thinking we were abducting you She's a freak! I'm really sorry... She's a good girl. A real gem But you'd better protect her when she "misunderstands" Yes, sir Um... Why are you bothering with a guy like me? Stupid question We live in different worlds, so to speak We breathe the same air I have a brother, 10 years older He died, though He was weak but reckless too A weakling who's gutsy enough to pick a fight with someone tougher You remind me of him He's way better looking, though Whoa! Thugs aren't cool anymore But back in my brother's day, they were big and cool picking fights They took care of their own shit What's so uncool about that? Why can't guys like us have a place to live how we want? I'm going to make our own era... Toman is a team Each member is ready to die for each other Die for each other... We'll take it as far as we can Come with us, Takemichi Hanagaki I like you Tough guys are a dime a dozen But you'll take on anyone to protect something you care about That's rare nowadays Wanna come to our meeting? Meeting? I don't think I should... It'll be fine [ TOKYO MANJI GANG ] Hey, you! Who said you could enter my line of sight? I'm sorry! - Get lost - I'm sorry! I knew it I knew this would happen Hey, Hanagaki Kiyomasa... The past is water under the bridge, OK?

He'll hurt anyone even a woman That's not how we fight! So what's it gonna be, Pah? Moebius is big We'll suffer casualties I don't wanna cause trouble That's not what I asked Wanna fight or not?

It's decided We crush Moebius! July 13 Showdown at Musashi Festival Whoa! So this is Toman's boss... What, punk? Mikey may be a good guy after all Sano, a good guy? Are you kidding? He's the head of Tokyo Manji Gang I know that's bad - But he's not really evil... - What are you saying? Forgive Sano for killing my sister? Never! I wish I could kill him! I swear, he's not like that! When Hina slapped him he just laughed and forgave her He's capable of laughing! The Tokyo Manji Gang of today isn't what Mikey envisioned So I want to talk to him in person Ask him why Toman changed I don't care Just go back in time, kill Sano and destroy Toman It's the only way to save my sister! Nobody can see him now anyway Unless you know someone in their executive ranks Do I? That's Akkun! Atsushi Sendo isn't a member He was arrested for stabbing Kiyomasa I stopped him I stopped him, didn't I? I did... Things are a little off What do you mean? Takemichi Even if you meet Sendo, don't say anything Aren't you coming? They're Toman. I'm a cop Welcome Good evening Any preferences? Akkun...

You stay the way you are So you own this huge club We live in different worlds But my world is empty The guy with you was a cop, right? Uh, no... Naoto Tachibana Hinata's brother He saved you on the train tracks that day How'd you know? Because it was me... That day I pushed you off the platform It was me It can't be... It's true - I tried to kill you - Stop it! It's not even funny! Akkun... You would never... You were gonna stab Kiyomasa to save Takuya You're tough, but kind-hearted... I... consider you my best friend! It's been 10 years but that... has never changed! That's nice to hear But I still tried to kill you I'm Kisaki's slave now I'm terrified of him You haven't progressed at all in 10 years How did it come to this? Toman wasn't like this 10 years ago Once Draken died Mikey changed Draken... died? He shouldn't have died Hey You can travel through time, right? That's the only way certain things make sense How did you know that I tried to stab Kiyomasa? How did Naoto Tachibana know you were going to fall on the tracks? What? I wish we could stay innocent like we were back then Ow! That hurts! - Does it? - Yeah! Wait.
