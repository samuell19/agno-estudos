Welcome to the commentary track for Trekkies 2. I'm Roger Nygard, director of this documentary, and with me today... Denise Crosby. I am the host and one of the executive producers. And Mike Leahy, producer. So the first thing you're seeing is the opening digital effect that Gabriel Koerner created for us. You may remember him as the 14-year-old from the first Trekkies talking about his opticals. Yeah, Gabriel now is 21, I believe. And working a lot in the industry. He's doing a lot of digital effects. And so he was a natural for us to go to to design our opening title sequence. We're hoping to be working for him in a couple of years. And he actually appears later in the film. He's one of the original profilees we wanted to go back to and revisit, like Barbara Adams and Daryl Frazetti, a couple of others. And here's our beloved baby who was on the design of the first Trekkies. - The opening... - The cover art of the box of the DVD. I thought it was a good idea to reprise that icon. It was something different to put the baby in space and do a 2001 take-off. Why do you have the old TV here, Roger? For just an art design choice. You have to choose something. The opening music is done by Fred Schneider and Pat Irwin of the B-52s. Obviously a very recognisable voice and it sets the film off on the right tone. We really wanted to have a fun, upbeat movie. - How did you get him? - Fred is a big Star Trek fan. He was going to contribute something to the first Trekkies, but we couldn't work it out because his schedule didn't fit our schedule. This time around I gave him a call and said, "Trekkies 2 is in the works. "Do you want to give it another shot?" And he said yeah. He was really thorough, too, about researching what we shot for the lyrics so that he could create some great lyrics. Pat Irwin, who is the guitarist and composer that he works with, he put a theremin sound on, which I had him take out and then put it back in once I saw it with the visuals 'cause it was really cool over the Paramount logo. Here we are, setting up the movie. You need to set the stage. We're telling a story, even though it's a documentary, and this sets the stage for the story. We're in Germany. Our first shoot, no? Yeah. You can see Bonn, Germany, in the background. It was some castle up in the hills over Bonn. Now, the Germany stop. That was our first convention. Yeah. And one of the biggest. It was amazing to me how pervasive English is around the world. I mean, we rarely had to translate. Almost everybody knows English. It's the language of the internet, I guess. What's funny is we went into this not really thinking that through and we were happy to find out everybody did speak English. Lucky. I started with an opening montage, which is a Roger Nygard clich? now. Did the same thing in Trekkies and Six Days In Roswell, but I think it gives people an idea of what's to come and maybe will help hold them to the end. Pique their interest enough to hold them to the end. We have a collection of a lot of different interviews, which again sets the stage for Germany. Here are the many different sorts of people you can meet. This is Peter Walker. He's a Brit living in Germany and there were about 300 people just like him shooting photo after photo - in the audience. - He didn't stop. He just kept shooting. Literally every second, his camera would go off. The next shot is Denise. You're walking on stage. 5,000 people. It is phenomenal, you know. It fills you with a lot of emotion, actually. I always get, really, a sort of mixture of warmth and embarrassment. How long ago was it that you were on the series? Well, you know, I mean, '86 I believe the pilot was shot. 18 years and they're still jumping to their feet like that. That's awesome. I love this lady. She's one of my favourites. - The women in blue next to him. - All she does is blink. The intensity. She was truly like an intellectual. I cut to your reaction laughing because it's what we're all doing. It's a fun moment. - This shocked us. - I'd like to meet his mother. - Now, this was really weird, Roger. - It's the last thing I thought he'd say. - The guy in green? - He was a little much. Again, a good sampling is what I went for here of the different people at a convention. Just a short montage of the varieties of people. These guys looked great, I thought. Ethan was probably the funniest guy we met in the entire trip. He has the funniest anecdote in history, but it's in the bonus material. These Trek dinners were something new to me. Had you heard about these? In every city, they have a Trek dinner. They get together and talk about Star Trek. No. This truly might be a European phenomenon. And all charity-related, which was neat. That was something that we knew from the first film and neglected, and I'm glad we addressed it in this, the charity aspect of Star Trek fans. - It's a big part of what they do. - This is my shot. Denise, you're all over this movie, but... No, not here. Sorry. Mike's got some great shots in there. I like the shot of Denise washing the windshield. That's what it was like. We piled into a van and went on the road. We just had to pitch in whenever. To any aspiring filmmakers, five people put this together. With Paramount's backing, it was really a little group that went out last summer and made this movie happen. It was great. This is Christoph. He and his fan-film friends, they built one of the most amazing sets you could imagine. Hands down. This, I think, was the most authentic-looking that I'd seen. - Speaking of authentic-looking. - This is Willi Wiegend. We had J Trusk who was a dead ringer for Captain Kirk in the first Trekkies, so I think Willi is our topper. He's even better because he doesn't speak English. It's hard. How do you top your first movie? There's only one first time. Right? We had Klingons ordering cheeseburgers and this time we had Klingons playing minigolf, so we gave it a shot. In German. It was really important, I think, to allow the people to speak their native language also. This is a phenomenon we see a couple of times in the movie, the fan film, where they pour all of their time and energy for little exhibition. Where are these going to go? They can't be released 'cause it's Star Trek. Wasn't it your idea, Mike, to shoot this scene? We shot the coverage, cut it together and they re-enacted a scene for us so we would have something, 'cause they didn't have a clip ready. Billy Sullivan and JJ Holiday, our composers, scored it, just like you would score a TV episode. What was neat about this guy was he was in military fatigues, having just come from the army that day, and had to change into that to shoot the scene. London. Yeah, we jumped over from France to London, so the film is not in the order necessarily that we shot it. It's more in an order that we felt would flow. We weren't planning a stop in England, because the convention we were going to was cancelled. But we squeezed in a 36-hour stop when we heard about Tony Alleyne, who lives here. And we didn't really have the budget, but we squeezed it in there somehow. How did you do that, Mike? It just was close enough... That's one thing about Europe. It was close enough that we could figure it out...and it paid off big time. They were willing to come to where we were staying. They made it really easy. We put the word out on the internet to meet us at this hotel and at a pub and enough people showed up and we got some great footage. And all different types of people, very diverse. We got lucky with that hotel lounge. It gave us some nice backgrounds. It's a hotel near the airport, nothing fancy, but... - It looks like we're in a palace. - Yeah. I think Tony Alleyne, who is coming up, probably gets the award for the most extraordinary Star Trek fan on this tour. And completely serious. He had a little sense of humour, but this is his real deal. We weren't going to go to England and he was the reason we went there. I found out about him at the last minute and that's when we squeezed in this quick stop. He was selling his apartment on eBay for $2 million. Yeah, he's known in England. People who aren't Star Trek fans have seen him advertise this. You kept Denise out until this last moment to get her reaction. To get a genuine reaction to this place, 'cause you gotta react. How long did it take him to make this? That's JJ Holiday who's just joined us, one of our composers. He said it took him two years to make the first console and then another year or two to finish the entire flat. It's tiny. It's a one-bedroom, one-bathroom flat. Yeah, it's more like a studio. One big room. I remember we were in the bathroom when there was this big crash. - Remember that? - Yeah. Bill our sound mixer was looking sheepishly at us 'cause he had touched something. This piece of the shelf fell off and broke this panel on the floor. Tony was a little upset. He was going to charge us, but by the time we were done, he gave us a pass. Is he the sole constructor of all this? - Yeah. - After work or something? He's an interior designer, so it comes naturally and he just turned his attention on his own flat in the Star Trek The Next Generation style. Roger, this is the most interesting kind of logic that's in the movie. He tries to give it away a couple of times. Perfectly logical. He can't give the console away, so he builds an apartment around it. - Very rational person. - Why not? He lives there 24/7. This is my face when he asks me to come into the bathroom. It's a good moment. And what's odd is my name does not appear on this list of the deceased. That's because she's coming back. My biggest question was how he didn't suffocate in this apartment, since he's down to one small window. That tiny little crack. I don't believe, as far as I know, he still has not sold it for $2 million. The whole point of it was a publicity ploy to make people aware of it. - Smart man. We went to England. - Yeah. It worked. Besides his construction, I think you should emphasise his dedication. His wife left him. He's obviously had problems because of this. - He's still... - It's his therapy. Anyone listening to this, when your wife leaves you, this is what you do. These transitions were created by Gabriel Koerner as well. What I wanted to do was show where we were in a quick, simple way, and Gabriel designed the panel effect. Mike went to Venice to get these shots. I stayed on the beach. Denise, did you stay on the beach? I did. I did go up to a strange little mountainous village with my family, where they sold Mussolini wine. Couldn't figure that one out. There were all these pictures of II Duce. - There's your son. - There he is. It was fun. The water was warm, too. It was nice for swimming, although there were jellyfish everywhere. And this is the big difference between the conventions. This was really about the food and community and sharing. The food is no joke in Italy. The entire convention would stop and we would meet for lunch at noon and all eat together and have this four-course meal, go back to the convention and at seven o'clock meet again. The convention stops for two hours, so we can eat together, but the whole country stops for two hours at lunch and dinner. It's part of their culture and it extends to the Star Trek convention. - It's a great idea. - Life as an addendum to food. It was four or five courses, one course after another. The first time we ate lunch there, they brought this plate of pasta and then they kept bringing more and more. When does it stop? This is Raffaello D'Agliano. We felt we needed to put him by the canal because he was in the navy. It made sense. We had him redo that story several times, so we could get the close-up. Also because cars kept driving by and we had to do it over again, he had to keep telling us his story. I noticed they spoke less English in Italy than some of the other countries where we visited. I think part of that was due to the fact they see more dubbed programming as opposed to subtitled. If it's subtitled, then they hear English. This is Andrea Papina. We almost went to his house for an interview, but we had to go to Florence, because we had a Bill-tastrophe moment. Our sound mixer's passport was stolen, so we had to get him a new passport so we could go to Serbia next. Our car was broken into. That was the only thing that befell us on this whole trip. The best costumes of any country are in Italy. You've got a country full of Italian tailors. They are nice, but later I'll point out something that was the most endearing uniform. You really get a sense of the different countries and the different styles. Father Bernie Carman's an American priest who comes every year to the Italian convention. Richard Arnold was a little nervous about us showing his Catholic Mass that takes place at the convention. I'm not sure why. There's no reason the two can't coexist. Well, it might have something to do with the fact that Gene Roddenberry was a devout atheist. I found it fascinating, just the mixture of the two things. A moment we didn't get on camera was when he does the Father, Son and Holy Spirit and he moves into a Vulcan salute. That was a bummer we didn't get that. That's part of documentary filmmaking, a lot of missed opportunities. You think back on all the things that you didn't get. Yeah, this is a serious guy. He really brings his faith into what he loves, which is Star Trek. He had one of the best costumes, too. Massimo and Jessica, they are the ones we went home with. We went to their store and we did this interview with them. We finished and had to get to the airport in an hour because of Bill's passport issue, in order to be able to get him on an aeroplane. As we were packing up the equipment, they said, "By the way, we have this Star Trek bridge in our basement." I said, "What? You didn't mention this till now?" It's like you go to the doctor and on the way out you say, "I vomited blood this morning. Does that mean anything?" Nice metaphor, Rog. I went down and got two shots of them sitting in their bridge. This was great. Remember? This is an interesting story. The power went out and it was a high-security alert and we're trying to grab a shot. Basically slipped into the naval base. Did we have permission? We weren't sure, but we were determined to grab that shot and I could see the military police walking toward us and thought, "God, guys, we are so busted." - But then they were totally cool. - We had the shot in the camera anyway. Is this the stop where we all went out for sushi one night? - Yes. The famous sushi I bought and... - They double-ordered. We'd all finished eating and Mike accidentally ordered $50 more sushi, 'cause there was a communication issue. It's odd that we had the communication issue in the US. We travelled the world, but I double-ordered sushi in the US. I'm just bummed out that I missed it. Then we packaged it up and gave it to the valet parkers. Bob Boudrouw made another appearance in Trekkies. He was in Trekkies and he returned with a few more well-placed assessments of the Trek fan psyche. Why are we back in the US? We wanted to check in on some of our original profilees and we didn't want to neglect the United States. Daryl Frazetti is on the East Coast and we wanted to see him again, the person who dresses his cats up in Star Trek uniforms. I remember Daryl told me that his guidance counsellor once suggested that he put his Trekkies appearance on his resume. Daryl Frazetti will probably make it into Trekkies 3, if we do another. I'd love to spend another week with Daryl. Yeah. Daryl sent all these great books on geology and geodes and fossils to my son Augie. - That was nice. - Yeah, Augie was really into it with him. Jacqueline Lichtenberg, we actually interviewed her in Newport Beach, but we fitted her in here. We could spend the whole movie with her, she had so much information. I had never actually been to a Klingon bash before. I don't know how I missed it, those guys. It was Vaughn Armstrong and... Robert O'Reilly is one of the fuzzed-out faces. This is the extreme fans segment and the first of our theme questions. One of my interests in doing a sequel was to ask the fans the questions about the issues they were most critical of in the first Trekkies. That we only showed the more extreme fans, for instance. It was their biggest criticism. I thought, "Let's decide what's too extreme. "Let's ask the fans themselves and let them define it for us." You could tell everybody agreed. I knew there'd be no consensus. There never is on an issue like that. It's like the Trekkies vs. Trekkers controversy. No matter how extreme you consider people, they always thought there was somebody more extreme than them. One of my favourite moments was interviewing Tony Alleyne and he realised that he was starting to sound like an anorak. It's a moment for him there. That's in the bonus material also. This is Paul Rudeen. I like his folksy, down-home, Minnesota approach. Whether you get a tan or not is the defining issue of whether you're too extreme. They all have anecdotes about people who are more extreme than them. Richard Arnold made another appearance in Trekkies 2. Dominic Keating, we caught up with him in Australia and we almost didn't get him. We were going to interview him in Sydney and then he said, "No. Try me again in Melbourne." Which we did. And then he said OK. I'm glad he did because he had some funny stories. Tracy Scoggins has a great point about going too far. Just walk down Rodeo Drive. We had to check in on Bobbie, or Barbara Adams. She's arguably the most famous Star Trek fan in the world. In the universe. I don't think there's anyone else more notorious. She has a following. People come to her to get things signed. And she's actually a great artist, too. - Yeah, she is. - Some of these drawings are beautiful. - She's so sweet. - She seems like it. You guys must have had a blast making this. - Meeting these people. - I really love our subject matter. They're great people. I respect Barbara, who makes a commitment to something. I notice this thread of goodness in them. That religious joining earlier. It makes sense. The charity work. What was neat about travelling is those customs doors would open and we knew we would be greeted by half a dozen excellent human beings. They would take us and show us around. They took great care of us. I remember we landed in Arkansas in the middle of a storm. We walked out of our hotel and saw tornadoes coming over the town of Little Rock, right over downtown. There's a photograph I put on the website of a tornado going right by. I would have to say the second-best meal of the entire trip to all eight countries was in Little Rock, Arkansas. Every night, me and David Doyle and Bill Martel, camera and sound, we went to a little shack in downtown Little Rock and they had the best fried catfish. It was incredible. Every night we'd go there and have the same thing. Even David Doyle? Yeah, Mr Fried Food. This a moment where the documentary gods are shining on us. We showed up and had a seven foot... He's actually six foot seven and I believe she's just under five feet. - So the differential really struck. - Did you stage this, Roger? How could you? - I love it. - This is her living room. - Is that right? - Yeah. Joel Soisson was going to be here. He's our other executive producer. But he said he didn't approve of people being on commentary tracks who have nothing to contribute, so I said, "You should come here and say that "and leave and slam the door on your way out." The uncanny resemblance. This is Jean Whitehead. She lives in the same complex as Barbara. Jean Whitehead had just gone to this UFO convention and that was pure luck on our part that she could come back and report to us about having been there. This is actually a portrait... So that alien, I presume, sat for that. I wonder if Jean saw the alien sitting for that. No, she just received that as a prize. A door prize. Barbara says the guardians are looking out for us, but I'd say the guardians must be on a lunch break - with the way things are in the world. - No kidding. They need to come back and pay attention. This was probably the most fun, colourful place I've ever visited. - Especially for you, Rog. - It was great. The nightlife there is amazing. Unbelievable. Insane. If you go to Brazil, you gotta go with rope tied around your waist so your friends can yank you out of there before you get stuck in that country, enjoying yourself. - We had three single guys there. - This was amazing, this helicopter ride. S?o Paulo is 14 million people. It's massive. They removed the door. I was strapped in, so I could look down and see. They asked if I'd be frightened to do that and I said, "No. Let's do it." - No vertigo? - No, it was wild. I was in the front seat holding the camera and Mike and I took turns because our DP, David Doyle, wouldn't go on the helicopter. He was afraid to get on the helicopter. I think he'd seen Apocalypse Now too many times. This is great. Watch this. I was holding the camera here and it sounds a lot worse than it was. She just hits the microphone and then puts my eye out. I love that she's so apologetic. She's supposed to be a Klingon and not care about those things. Brazil is where Orson Welles didn't finish a movie, speaking of Apocalypse Now. It's Hearts Of Darkness, the whole crew got lost there. He should have had a rope around his waist and had someone yank him out. A couple of guys left their wives and... Wow, not surprising. It does kind of put a spell over you. - Who are these...? - Brazilians. - Trek fans. - Those are Trekkies. This is Denizar Franco. He was the first person we interviewed there. I remember his apartment. He had friends come over. It was cramped and there was excitement in the air and I hid behind that refrigerator for the interview. - Why? Were you afraid of him? - I'm not supposed to be on camera. - There were no places to hide. - I see. Now, this is really funny. When you knocked over his super-valuable figurine, I knew, at that second, that is definitely in the movie. There's no doubt in my mind. There are a few of those, but this is a great one. Watch his face. He's been saving up for ever. I don't even know where they're supposed to go. - What were you doing? - I was going to play with them. I had a Barbie doll house when I grew up. - I know what to do with these things. - He was very nice about it. I know. Poor guy. Oh, God. - Who's this? - Serginho Caffe. He's a great example of a very successful person who just happens to like to wear a Star Trek shirt to work. - He's a radio personality there. - Yeah. Very big following. Sometimes he talked about Star Trek on the air, but not often. It was something he liked to do in his own time and was a part of who he is. We shot this through the window. It has a different look. We're shooting through a window that had years of greasy palms pressed against it. And here's famous Ralfo. Oh, Ralfo. - We love you, buddy. - We do. He really gave us a great tour of the city. He is just a great cartoonist. - This is his own work. - In his store. By the way, he's moved. The store was in a basement where water was leaking through the wall. He's moved to a nicer location. This guy's not necessarily a Trekkie. - He's just a publisher. - He's both. He's into both. He's wearing a little communicator badge. He's very philosophical about it. Obviously he's making money, but he's definitely understood the reality of the world of Trek. What was the English factor? It was similar to Italy, where they spoke less English. This is a segment where we asked people, "When is it appropriate to wear Star Trek uniform in public?" Barbara Adams took a lot of heat for wearing her uniform to jury duty and I was hoping to have somebody debate her on the subject. We got lucky 'cause somebody did. And leave it to Brannon Braga to sum up the reality of it. Yeah, it was great to have Brannon in this movie also. He's so funny. He's so dry. He is, and he's been a great support. That's Jacqueline Lichtenberg again. She's one of the original people who were involved in the first Star Trek conventions. Robert Burnett was someone we got in toward the end. I'm glad we got him in the movie 'cause he's now a luminary in the Star Trek world because of Free Enterprise, and he's a major Star Trek fan. He was as enthusiastic as anyone we met. We forgot to put this in the cut and then you went back and... Yeah. I added this really late. I found it. I had 150 hours of footage to wade through and one of the last nuggets that I dug out of that footage was Richard Arnold's Gene Roddenberry anecdote, which sort of settles the debate about Trekkies and Trekkers. - Does it really? - For me. You gotta go with Gene Roddenberry's take on it if you're going to make a call. This is Benjamin Ossoff and I love the fact he watched the same film where some people took issue with Barbara Adams wearing a uniform. He saw that and it was a positive influence on his life. I think the topic of this movie and the film are like a Rorschach test, where people see different things depending on what's inside themselves. This is a nice moment here. We get the debate first hand. He did not know Barbara Adams was in the room. It was a total surprise to him. I love her. She's one of my favourites, too, this nurse. Catherine Blakley is her name. She's cool. What she says sums it up at the end. She's so accepting of herself for who she is, and I love that fact. That's what a lot of these Star Trek fans are like. - These guys were from Spain. - They met us in England. We did get some Spaniards in the movie, which was nice. Robby Amper, who is also a fan-film director, is fairly famous in Germany for his fan films, which have aired on German network. He makes a great point here. There's Ben. He was part of the first group. He's famous for being part of the original Star Trek convention organisers. I learned a little bit of Portuguese. I won't ask what that means. I don't know either. What's this? Where did we go to a yacht club? - In San Diego. - Where did that come from? - I don't remember that location. - That was a quick pick-up. We were going to go shoot at Comicon and we went to San Diego, but they would not give us press credentials. So we said, "Whatever. Forget it." But we did pick up interviews that we had pre-arranged. This is her great moment. I love this. The fringes? This is great, too. She's just trying to get it straight here. I think the fringes are where it's at. You mention that people were inspired by the first film. You know, Gabriel did a number of TV shows for what's-his-name. Yeah. He was on The Drew Carey Show twice. He was the Star Trek geek on Beat The Geeks. The whole thing with Drew Carey is I was doing a guest spot and I came on to do the first table read and Drew was so excited I was there. You know, from Trekkies. Not Star Trek, but from Trekkies. Speaking of Gabe, here he is. Yeah, and I think Drew saw in Gabe what he was back in the day. Which happened a lot in the first Trekkies. Gabriel has a lot of fans. We had to revisit Gabriel. No way to do a sequel and not check in on Gabriel. He did all the cards for this. All the visual effects, he did on his home computer right behind him. I just have one question. Where's his mullet? Yeah. I think he has updated his hairstyle. That's just not right. Something wrong with that. Maybe he doesn't have an achy-breaky heart any more. He's married. He's great. Every place we went, we tried to get five or six visuals to sum up the location, and the visuals for Bakersfield are some of my favourite. It totally sums up... We nailed Bakersfield. Gabriel's wife Allison, she was a little shy about going on camera at first. - I heard she wasn't going to do it. - We had to talk her into it. I'm glad she did. She really opened up and augments Gabriel's stories. Yeah, she completes him. I like all the candles burning in the background. The mood. I like that. They had just moved there and the place was bare. All we could find were two candles and a couple of appliances for that corner. - And the Enterprise. - An Enterprise Gabriel had in his car. It is amazing. They are two peas in a pod. While he was this geeky Star Trek kid, she was a Goth chick at 15. So they melded these two worlds and are happily married in Bakersfield. As much as Gabriel has changed, his dad Richard Koerner hasn't changed an iota. Now, we saved all of our California stops for last. We loaded up a van and went on the road around California. Bakersfield was hot. It was really hot. In his little tiny garage to shoot the movie. I just love the fact that Richard Koerner is just so committed to his son, you know, so supportive of his endeavours. - Loses his job, loses his fianc?e... - And just keeps going. "But goes, man, this is what my kid likes and this is what I'm doing." Now, you guys, Billy and JJ are here. You guys did a great musical score. It's from surf to Serbia. - Surf to Serbia and back through Brazil. - I love it. What was the challenge like? Well, the challenge for us, I think, was that it was required that we go all over the world, so we had to get a string quartet for France. We had to do the English beat meets... You know, Sid Vicious, the English punk for England. Serbian music I had to investigate, 'cause I'd never listened to it. So I had to really listen to Serbian music. So the challenge was that everywhere we went, we had to come up with something that was true to that country. Then you got Roger breathing down over your shoulder, who has rewrites and re-requests, and that's just part of the game, I think. For any composer working for a director, they have their own idea about what they want. That challenge was on top of it. Remember you did France? The first thing you turned in. That really solidified for me you doing this gig. We didn't change a thing there. It was great from the first to the last note. It was nice to have you guys on board again for the second one. That continuity, I think it's great. It's appreciated when film-makers come back to people that started on a project. That's where we felt that we had an obligation to rise to the occasion and do whatever we need to do to deliver a score. And it was challenging for us. It's a lot of different styles of music, you know. It was hot in this garage. It was about 105 or 110. I want to comment on that. That beard is incredible. - Is that fake? - Yeah. All I know watching this now is I think of everywhere I hid, behind walls and refrigerators, trying to get out of the way. - Which is not an easy task. - Especially in these small places. Gabriel has the most memorable quotes from the first Trekkies, and so we reprised a few of them here just so he could give us an update. His IQ, what is it, 200 or something, this guy? I love him. He's got a couple of good quotes in this one. He's got a great sense of humour about it all. - He gets it. - Feel the power. You can't harm Gabriel. He's impervious to criticism, to insult. He is comfortable in who he is. I tell you, he is my idol. I want to be like Gabriel. - How old is he? - 21 right now. - And he's that together. - I know. Velma was having a ball with us, the great-great-grandmother-in-law and the three generations of mother-in-laws. All right, here's the shot. This is my one shot I'm actually in the movie. I think I'm sleeping on the train. That's it. Sound asleep. What's great about that is in the car we were riding in, the air conditioning had broken and it was so unbelievably hot that eventually I left that car and found another one, but Mike and David insisted on just staying put and I think they were passing out, actually, from the heat. They thought they were sleeping, but they were passing out. Did you mostly spend time in Paris? Yeah. Paris is the most beautiful city I have ever seen. There are so many landmarks, you can't see them all, and every corner is art and architecture and delicious food, museums. - Tell us about her. - She's the daughter of her. OK. That's Pascale and her daughter Valentine. They did not have a convention scheduled in France, so we made a special trip to meet with this fan club and, Denise, you made these contacts for both France and Serbia through Charlie Wall. Right, Charlie is a writer for The Communicator, which is one of the official Star Trek magazines and...Charlie's name was brought up to me and he was... Really, I give him credit for finding France and Serbia for us. We've got him hard at work now digging out Star Trek fans in Asia. Trekkies 3. - See, this guy knows how to live. - Man, this was outrageous. He must have made 15 quiches, different quiches, by hand, you know. This is a moment where we failed, because right behind him is a wall of Star Trek videos in his kitchen. We did a pan over to it, but we saw Bill in the shot. You know, you just eat and drink and eat and drink some more. All we did. Talk about Star Trek and then eat and drink some more. Let's all move there. Our lactose-intolerant DP could not wait to get the hell out of this cheese-soaked country. - I know. - This guy wrote a bunch of scripts. He's got all these scripts here and none of them are accepted and he just laughs it off. And he drew this cartoon book. This guy's my hero. Look at this guy. I know. And that was when he was a kid. Another example of how phenomenal these fan films are. I had a lot of trouble finding an ending for the France segment. So I finally ended it on one of Eric's stories about his comic book and how he had to move on to something else. - He laughs. It was great. - Look at this. We laughed at where he shrugs his shoulder... We watched this 50 times. There you go. There goes 20 years of work. So there's our ending for France. Oh, God love him. Normal fans. The most common criticism that I have received was, "You need to show more 'normal' fans", and my response was always, "OK, but who decides what's normal?" So again, let's ask the Star Trek fans. Yeah. And what do they say? Is there any general gist here? Well, once again it's hard to find a consensus. Nobody can decide what is normal or what's too far. They all disagree. So once again it's a very accepting, open society that's basically good. That's what I get from it. We found that a lot of Star Trek fans revel in their oddness. - It's all accepted. They value difference. - Right. It's a perfect society. I like it. I'm joining. - There's room. They'll let you in. - I know they will. - Where's this? - Germany. She had a romance brewing with her fellow Trek fan. That's on the bonus material. A lot of romances ignite at these conventions. Another great cogent way to sum it up from Brannon, that if we did a documentary on the average Star Trek fan, we would bore everyone to tears. If you did a documentary on great sports heroes, you wouldn't do it on the guy who bats 200, you'd do it on the exceptional player who bats 400. He summed it up right there. This is one of my favourite moments. What great timing. Two fellas... Two fellas...from Adelaide. Phil Morris makes a great point. He sums it up that if your obsessiveness enhances your personality, then it's a good thing. Why not? He also has nice biceps. Kind of like me. I felt a kinship with him. You guys wear similar T-shirts. - This is a great moment. - I'm a little bigger than him. - That's right. - The hand grab for the microphone. So desperate to talk. Everybody obsesses about something. I guess that's the point. We all do. We're all obsessive about something. Good examples of that. She reminds me of the way my mother was. If someone's teasing you, it's their problem. I love that. Good advice. Vaughn Armstrong became the star of our bonus material. He's all over it playing his ukulele. He learned that ukulele to have something to do at these conventions. He went to a convention and it was a disaster for him. He didn't have anything prepared, so you gotta learn a shtick. Beautiful location. My God. Yeah, that was in Munich. We drove to Munich just to meet with Robbie. That's where I had a plate of schnitzel. First time I've eaten pork in ten years. - But I figure, when in Rome... - It was good. Or Munich. It was delicious. Although, in Germany, every other restaurant is an Italian restaurant. - So... - But really Italian. It's not about German food in Germany. I loved this cue. This cue was so fun to do. Whistling. Didn't you have to pitch that up? I whistled twice and everything worked out. You did the whistling. Could you give us a little taste of it now? I can't. I can't do it. Minnesota's my home state, so I know what makes Minnesotans tick. And I've known Brian Dellis since college, who we're about to focus on next. He's our local Star Trek person that we spent time with. He's made Star Trek-related videos ever since I've known him. Brian's a good example of people in Minnesota. Brian and Paul Rudeen, Ken Wieken. This is a clip from the original Trekkies. We needed to choose some of our original profilees to follow up on, and some were available and some weren't, and Brian was available. Just funny. David Doyle and I and my 11-year-old nephew shot this convention. So the audio's not always that stellar on this particular stop. Brian's the real thing. He's had Star Trek on his business card ever since I've known him, him in a Star Trek uniform. You show some clips of some early movies later, don't you? Of his. Paramount should get him to hawk Trekkies 2. He's a promo man. He's like the old Barnum & Bailey variety. He's a force of nature. This was fun - the Klingon battle tournament. We looked at the schedule and only had time for a couple of things. That sounded interesting. I feel sorry for the family that came out to Minnesota that same weekend and are in their hotel room looking out the window. The atrium of their hotel lobby. These are priceless. This is some of my favourite stuff in the movie. This is just unbelievable. Yeah, same guys. - Together since the beginning. - Are they lovers? You can ask him at the screening tonight. Tonight is our premiere. I'm in a tie. We're going to Paramount to screen this movie. You're wearing an orange shirt like the guy in Suckers. Yeah, right. - My other film, Suckers. - Give it a plug. Now, Brian shot his fan film, The Final Frontier Revisited, in two days. Actually two half-days, he shot this whole thing. Where can you see this movie, Roger? - On our bonus material. - Sweet. There's a commentary track that goes along with that that the three guys, Brian and Paul and Ken, recorded. Look at that picture. It's 20 years earlier. He's still got the picture from when he was 22. And where is this set? This is Hastings, Minnesota, where there is this town... A guy who owned 20 acres just started buying up old buildings and transporting them to his land, and put them all there and now he just has this Old West town. So you can go out and film a Western out here? - You just gotta ask him. - Really? They shoot commercials there, too, and all the extras are from the Old West Society in Minnesota and they donated their time and their horses and wagons and guns. It's all authentic. The guns are original 100-year-old guns. So what's the theme of this? What's the general story, real quick? That's his grandfather. He's gone back in time. It's time travel. There are these typical Star Trek stories, and one typical story is time travel. And so the guy goes back in time and confronts his... Great-great-great-great-grandfather. I put a ringing sound here. There is a possibility that I attended the same Alice Cooper concert that Brian mentions, because I did see Alice Cooper at the Hollywood Bowl in the '70s. I just remember a lot of snakes and that was during his snake glam rock period. Did he put himself in a guillotine? - I think so. - I saw it, too. Synchronicity. - This guy here, wow. - Yeah, he's surreal. - I think those are his real ears. - That's Ken Wieken. He lived in the same neighbourhood. They all grew up together. David Doyle, our DP, or Crazy Eye, as Dave Smith called him in Sacramento, was panicky from how loud those guns were. Those are full-load blanks there. Yeah. By the way, just as a footnote, he was called Crazy Eye because he'd put one eye up to the camera but look around with the other, and it appeared that his eyes could look independently of one another, like a reptile. And they can, right? I caught that a few times. That's just one of many interesting attributes of David Doyle. There's a shot in here where I actually thought it was David Doyle. Everybody in Minnesota looks the same. There. I thought that was David Doyle when I first saw it. That's Kim Thomassen. He's an actor/comedian in Minnesota, who worked with Brian. I love the Minnesota accent, how Brian pronounces "roof" as "rough". Very Minnesota, accent-wise. So he's killed his grandfather and now he disappears because he never existed. - You got it. - That's more than I ever... I'm still fixated on the David Doyle look-alike. Right. I thought that was him, too, actually. I think we all had a breakdown at one point on the trip and Australia was my breakdown, where I was so sick for two days and I just sort of pushed through it to keep shooting. It was SARS, wasn't it? Let's remind our listening audience that we flew back from Serbia and had one day off before we flew to Australia. Talk about jet lag. I just collapsed, I think, from all that travelling. - Body shutdown. - These guys were great. He is the didgeridoo musician. Billy tried to record some things here, some didgeridoo, to augment this, but it really showed just how great what this guy's doing. He's doing the real thing. It's so difficult. He was just a street musician in Sydney harbour. Kathleen Copper, she wins the tattoo award hands down. She does. She didn't strike me as a tattoo chick. I thought we'd have to do some persuading... Not at all. No. I guess if you get a tattoo, the idea is to show it off. I'm going to send this DVD to her parents, so they can find out. - This is Denise's finest moment. - I love this quote. Great. Great shot. Thanks, Rog. Everybody was loose and having a good time. We're on a big floating ship in the harbour and with an unlimited amount of wine. Nourishment. Here's the last shot of the movie. Connor Trinneer was the last interview. We called his manager for a photo clearance. He suggested we interview him, which is a first. It never happens. Offered him right up. We had some digital distortion in Australia also and I think it had to do with the PD-150. It's not as stable a camera as the DSR-500, which were the two cameras we used, the two DVCAM cameras. And this guy hand-makes these ships on Sydney harbour. Beautiful craftsman. He was there sanding those little pieces by hand. A thing I noticed is these quick edits, but there are some interesting gems. Very involved, all this, what they're talking about. The editing style that I went for here was to keep it moving, keep it bouncing, but there's not a wasted frame between each sound bite. There's no pause, so that when we do pause, then the pause has emphasis. You said you had 150 hours. Yeah, it took me eight months to wade through the footage. - What's the running time? - 93 minutes. - And still seven minutes too long. - Right. It's always too long. It's never short enough. In every country we looked for somebody to go home with and get in depth with. We almost struck out in Australia. We did. This is a last-minute grab, then all of a sudden Judy appeared. The last day of the last convention we met her. I knew immediately such a beacon of positive energy would be great. - The greatest smile. - Great family. Gabriel was like that from the first one. You met Gabriel standing in line. Yes, Denise did and we just did the briefest of interviews with him. "Hi, I'm Gabriel. I'm 14." And then I was watching the footage and I thought, "This kid's different. He's interesting." - Very articulate. - We went back to him. The younger daughter is corralled into this. The older one is... She's already broken out of the cult. I love the generational difference here. She's embarrassed by it now, but she's at that age when you rebel against everything. Everything's embarrassing to her. The teenage girls are embarrassed by the ladies that come over and have tea and look at the heavenly bodies. That was the unpredictable direction of this segment. You never know. With a documentary, it's a journey. You don't know where it's going to take you and we met these women talking about why they loved Star Trek and it led in this direction, where they just loved to watch the bodies, the men. We were going to go home with Judy and talk to her and she says, "Do you want me to get the girls?" What girls? "We get together every week." Within hours, she had this group at her house and we were there to interview them all. And once again, heavy doses of self-acceptance all around. We were mixing this and it made me laugh when our sound mixer, who did a brilliant job, he says at this quote, "Star Trek's good for everything." I did not always remember and I need to remember to do it better, to get cover shots, get cutaways, get reactions, get nodding heads, because in the editing room you can get stuck. This is fun, just to get his response to this. Yeah. We had this clip and we were showing Connor what all his Aussie girlfriends were saying about him. "He's a bit of an all right." I like that expression. We asked him if he had a message he would give that we could pass on to the women of Australia, and he gave this sweet message and we made an MP3 and emailed it to them, which they put on their website, and everyone in Australia heard it. If you ask us, do you want me to sing? - Beg me. - Of course we want you to sing. This is when we knew we had to find her home and check out more about her. She's very focused on what she's interested in. - Extremely. - And very normal. You know, the typical family. Husband, wife, two kids. Back to our home base, and how do you sum up Los Angeles in five or six shots? Traffic. Surf music for LA. Brannon was ready for a follow-up. This time we invited the assistants to talk about their fan experiences. They have a lot of great anecdotes because they deal with Star Trek fans. On a daily basis, they get phone calls. On the first film, we had Brannon talking about all the packages sent in. How do you top that? A great story, but this time we have the crab guy. Yeah. And, by the way, the guy who sends the travel brochures and just letters about what he had for lunch, he's still sending them. There they are. His desk is piled high with that week's packages. David Goodman, another producer we interviewed, didn't he tell you about Romeo And Juliet? He did. We credit David with that find. That's coming up. This is, to me, unbelievable. I mean, I kind of want to see this show. I hope somebody will make the crab show. Electra The Giant Robot Crab. This might be the impetus to get that show made. If anyone's listening. Let's fish. It's an obsession. Once again, another facet of obsessive behaviour. Romeo And Juliet: The Last Battlefield. This was a gold mine, a nugget that fell... Here we are in LA, but we don't know it exists and someone says, "By the way..." We're there the next night with the camera. I shot this and I keep thinking, "Did David Doyle shoot anything?" - Where is this in LA? - This is in the tiniest theatre off of... - No. - It's between Hollywood and Sunset. - Next to the Lava Lounge. - And these are real thespians. These are guys that are... I had to have them re-enact crucial scenes to get some coverage, like the "Wherefore art thou Romeo?" scene, for instance. What was weird, having seen the whole play - it does mesh these two things. It's not as insane as you'd think. - He pulled out an artefact from his past. - Real fans. - What year was that? - '76. I like this, how he shows an example of how Gene Roddenberry did borrow from Shakespeare. "Live long and prosper" is basically taken from Shakespeare. The audiences were having as much fun as the actors. I love the garage lights up there on the ceiling. Art just needs to happen. You can't stop it. It worked. What was the audience like that night? Some were in uniform, some had half-white, half-black face. So, like fans coming out to support the theatre. The filk segment belongs to Mike and Stacy Chess, my editorial assistant. Bill Martel shot it. I wasn't there. It's a great segment. It was headed for the bonus material, but we loved it so much we had to squeeze it in. When I saw this, this was priceless to me. Again it's just the other expression of art. These people are serious and there's a lot of humour in it, but they love the artistic expression. And it's a unique aspect of Star Trek fandom that a lot of people don't know about. Science fiction folk songs. And Leslie Fish is an icon. - Who did our continuity script? - Rick's wife Fran. Right, Fran, and she said, "Leslie Fish, my gosh, you got her in this movie." It brought back memories for her 'cause she's a superstar in the filk world. You came in the next day, Mike. I had them strike off three copies of this immediately. These two girls were my favourite. I need to look them up. We need to do something about them exclusively. It'd be great to go and spend a week with them and see their lives. Wait till you hear the song. It's beautiful. - They have beautiful voices. - Their dad's in the background. That's his real hair and they're playing... I don't even want to talk over this 'cause I love it so much. I like the way Bill recorded it, too. Bill put a near mic and a far mic and it captures what it's like to be there. These are future Alanis Morissettes. These girls are going to make it. Unfortunately, they live near Alaska, but we'll do something with them. - Aren't they from Portland? - That's near Alaska, isn't it? We'll get an atlas out for you when we get to the office. - I don't know what that is. - The unicorn guy. The unicorn guy, of course. This is the ballad that Leslie Fish is best known for. Everybody got up with her to sing. They all knew every word. We had them do it a couple of times and I was singing by the second time. This right here is what that folk fake Chris Guest documentary... - Mighty Wind. - ...Mighty Wind wishes it could be. - You don't need to make it up. - This is just wonderful. This is her smoking and drinking in her hotel room with a few people doing a private concert. We set the camera up. We got there, she'd written another verse for a new song. This is the Prime Directive segment, where we needed to talk about Star Trek charity work and this is what you're talking about, JJ, about how it's pervasive with fans. I'd noticed that all the way through, just watching as an observer here. That sense of community, it's very pliable, what it means to you, and I think it's just an excuse for something that's human. Strangely enough, being an alien sort of thing, isn't it? It truly touches the best in people. It allows people to really try and be the best they can be. When I was editing this, it didn't quite flow and Denise had the suggestion to move the Donna Fleming segment to the end, which played much better. You were absolutely right about that. I had the producer's assistants, originally they ended the segment. and it didn't quite end as well because you can't top Donna's story. No, it's real life-and-death situations. We get serious here, and it was intentional 'cause it's out there and our job to document it was to get all aspects, and she drove far to be with us, to tell us her story at the end of this clip. That's true. It was tough to do this interview, too, because obviously this was a very difficult thing for her to do. Yeah. I wasn't present for this interview. So this came as a complete surprise to me when I viewed your cut, Roger. And I was speechless. I mean, being a mother myself, I was so genuinely moved by it. I just thought this is incredible. And it's just one example for the thousands of other examples out there that we didn't meet or encounter. For every one there's another thousand just like it. Which is a really nice segue, actually, from that. This is the heart of the movie for me, and the uniforms, they are all paper cut-out insignias that they've taped to their blue shirts. For the Serbian sci-fi club in Belgrade, 'cause there were two different groups. They don't have a lot of money and they needed to look the part, so they went to this effort of putting this together on a limited budget, and it was the most heartfelt uniform I saw. What I sensed here was Star Trek, they interpreted it as freedom. Exactly. Very well said. It's a beacon of freedom for their possible future. If all these diverse people can find a common peace, then certainly the Muslims and the Serbs, you know, or the Croatians and the Serbs, can find some peace. Yeah. It's flared up since we've been there, some of the in-fighting. Right. Everybody hates their neighbour, no matter where you go around the world. Hatfields, McCoys, Serbians and Croatians. Argentinians and Peruvians, anywhere you go on the globe. Indians, Pakistanis, everybody hates their neighbour. There are just too many people, not enough land. There it is. That's the insignia. It's just a little piece of paper stuck to her outfit. We're on top of the castle for this interview. And it's a nice-looking logo. I had an opportunity to ride the train with the camera. An interesting story is once they heard an American voice on this train car, everybody got quiet in the whole car and they all know English and were listening to the discussion I was having with the people travelling with me. When it pulled into the town, a man started yelling something in Serbian and I found out that he was announcing to me, in his native tongue, "This is my town. This is where I'm from." And he just wanted the American to know the pride he had in his homeland. This is Alexander Nedeljkovic, the leader of the sci-fi club in Belgrade. We were so tired that we almost blew off that stop, and he blew a gasket when we were wavering about going there, so we decided to make the stop and I'm really glad we did. I think his honour was at stake. He had told everyone that we were coming. Remember, nobody had visited their country. - They didn't want to lose an opportunity. - That was part of it. They were happy to see us. Nobody visits them. They can only travel to the nearest five countries. They need a visa to go anywhere and it's difficult to get, so they were like shut-ins. It was huge. They built the convention around Denise coming. Their first ever. This is Veljko Vidic, and he owns the only true Star Trek uniform in Serbia. This is his mother and the apartment they live in. Yes, his mother was quite a glamorous woman. - Very proud. - Very theatrical. She was a like an old European old-style actress. I remember I brought a bottle of water with gas in this room and opened it up and it sprayed and almost... - Wrecked his drawings. - Right. But if you look at... Veljko is an architecture student. It's very detailed and specific. And...he was like a kid, pulling out his signed, autographed baseball cards. It was just unbelievable. He wanted to show me everything. Novi Sad is north of Belgrade and it's where the Belgradians go to party. It's a beautiful city, full of beautiful architecture, but it's also mixed with the very plain-looking socialistic buildings. - I was hiding behind that wall there. - Next to Grandma. And the incredible thing, too, is that again here we are in Serbia, a country that is struggling and doesn't have much in the way of excesses, and they were so generous. When we went to their house, they had a table spread with food, pulled out their best drinks. Just, you know, again, people generally that have less give more. It was touching to be there. The first convention ever. They felt like they were joining the rest of the world by having this convention. They read on the internet how everyone else has Star Trek conventions and gets to share in that passion and gather together. They were joining the world community of Star Trek fans. There was electricity in this place. It was hot. There was no elevator. This is at the university they're holding this, where a number of them go to school, and you'll see we were... We were just dying of heat. This girl memorised your entire death speech and it's on our bonus material and she recited it for us. I think one of the most amazing things was when a gentleman came up and asked me to autograph a photo and he was just a big strong strapping farmer that was working the fields all the time and had those big calloused hands and nits, you know, and just gave me a photograph and had tears in his eyes that we were there and that we recognised them. We represent hope or something to them. There's a hope quality that's really positive here. Mike shot this segment with Relja, and I told Mike after I saw it that this is where you earned your salary. That was it, yeah. I love how you shot the same story in two locations, so I could intercut. Yeah, I earned my $52. There's movement here. I don't think we have a lot 'cause of the talking heads. A little different style. Don't get us wrong. David Doyle shot 95% of this movie, but occasionally we would grab the camera and grab something ourselves. What time of year is this? Where are you? - Spring. - Heading into summer. - Yeah, May, June. - It's nice and warm here at this point. You can see the broken-down infrastructure here. We drove by buildings that NATO had bombed and bridges that were collapsed. There's all bands in here. This is all about bands. There are five Star Trek-themed tribute bands, all in Sacramento. But they were all in cahoots with each other in some way. They know each other, played with each other, been in each other's bands. So there's a community of... That's incredible. Warp 11 is the first band and they take the Star Trek tribute band role seriously. They're really polished, and their fans go nuts. It's like being at a stadium rock concert, a Def Leppard concert or something. And the girls there you saw in red, those are the Warpees. The Warp 11 groupies. They're satirical and fun. Like all rock 'n' roll, it's about drinking and sex, and Star Trek, in this case. They're obviously really into Star Trek and have seen all the episodes. It's hard to stop them. The next band is No Kill I. Seeing a No Kill I show to me is what it would be like to see a Sex Pistols show. You had no idea what was going to happen next. They were ready to walk off the stage before it had even started. They couldn't get friends in on the guest list. Weren't there bands with the same name almost? No Kill I different versions. - Exactly. - Like Star Trek, there are sequel bands. The audience was there for the unpredictable nature of the show. Mike, you were up front taking pictures and then you bolted. - You just panicked. - I retreated. I gotta say... - You were afraid? - I don't think I was afraid. - I just didn't want to get puked on. - He was afraid. He's on the floor and he's still singing. That was Ed Hunter. Kirk. We went to Dave Smith's place the day after the show and I think he was still hung over when we interviewed him. He's probably on a perpetual hangover. He said in the old days he used to be, but he took his drinking mug off the wall just for this particular occasion. There's a moment coming up where I do pause. I stopped and did a pause for emphasis, which is right here when he is talking about his Star Trek games. Just so we could see his thinking process. I love the fact that he's an archbishop. He ordered a certificate through the mail for $5. That's all it takes to become a legal cleric. Here's a sequel band. These guys are great. Kind of ska. They knew they were a parody and totally play it up. - So they're called No Kill I as well? - The Next Generation. And they were awesome. Talk about getting the crowd into it. I love his moves. He was a replacement lead singer. They couldn't find the original guy. He had disappeared and turned up subsequently, pissed that they'd left him out, but he was nowhere to be found. This guy had long hair, shoulder-length hair, and they shaved it off just for the Picard look for this concert. This is No Kill I: Deep Space Nine. Michael Leon, on the right and singing now, he sent me a letter after he had seen the first Trekkies. He was the first contact I had with these bands. The letter looked like it was written by a ten-year-old, just kind of scrawled, which said, "We play in this band. Come and put us in your next movie." - A few years later, it worked. - Be careful what you ask for. Stovokor, they come from Portland. I think Dave Smith heard about them and arranged to have them there for the show. That's near Alaska, isn't it? - On your atlas. - What does Stovokor mean? It's the Valhalla for Klingons, the place they go when a warrior dies. Like he just explained. I guess I should watch the movie. Sorry. Every one of these guys came out and did their set and stole the show. It was really a phenomenal evening. Klingon death metal. We interviewed them in the park and, at one point, they just start improv-ing with a group who had stopped to watch. I think, for me, this is the funniest moment in the movie. And the old guy was such a good sport. I remember him just sitting there... ...and just saying, "I'm 93 years old." That is...a riot. I put the subtitles in for the songs because you really do need to know the lyrics of the songs to enjoy it. Yes, and us old fogeys just can't hear that rock 'n' roll too well any more. There was some kind of a rivalry going on between No Kill I and Warp 11. A little bit of rivalry and who came first and whose idea... I think No Kill I was second after The Shatners and the other bands followed and Warp 11 didn't want to orbit No Kill I. They wanted to go on their own trajectory. Even with five bands, there was plenty of room for everybody. That's the rehearsal garage, where they practise. - There's Bill, our sound guy. - Bill's cameo. They all had such a great sense of humour. That was the overriding feeling I got from Sacramento. They'd totally embraced Star Trek in a humorous way. His lyrics are a blast. They're really funny. And just to hear that played live, it's great. Sums up the movie. I love that quote. Here's another Nygard clich?, the ending montage with a look to the future, but it's a sequel, and you have to follow the original formula to some degree. I like asking people to make predictions 'cause you get such diverse responses. But you went far into the future with this. Yeah. Looking at 100 years from now, not next year. What do you really predict for the long term? Richard Herd has a great quote coming up where he says, "The secret to any success is not to give too much." Which is so true. This'll be a great idea for the Star Trek movies to re-energise the franchise. Do a Klingon movie, a movie about just the Klingons. That is a great idea. The other interesting thing, everybody had their favourites. Every kind of Star Trek show had fans, all over the world. And factions and sub-factions within sub-factions. And here she is again, the blinker. The stoic. This was Jen's favourite quote. The apple-pie quote. Jen was our production coordinator/associate producer. It can be applied to so many different aspects of life. Even actually apple pie. Gabriel's a smart guy. You can ask him anything and whatever comes out of his mouth is gold. He's just funny and he's fun to listen to. This is Mike Standage, and he was one of our hosts in England and he makes a great point that the Star Trek fan phenomenon is about family, where people find a family atmosphere and acceptance. Your family has to accept you. If you go home, they have to let you in. That's what Star Trek conventions are like. This almost didn't end up in the movie, did it? No, you know, Joel Soisson was the one who talked me into keeping it. I was against putting in this last montage. It's like double montage upon montage and I was a little egocentric to put in self-referential reviews, but it's fun to hear what people thought about the first film and again the criticism of the first film gave them a chance to air those points of view. Yeah. A few people really didn't appreciate it. So it was neat to ask this question and we're not shy. We wanted to hear from everybody. It was hard to get people who were negative about Trekkies to talk about it. When we did find someone, it was great. I wanted to hear contradictory opinions. It also sort of advertises Trekkies 3. Here are all the things to come, the people we didn't interview yet from the first Trekkies. Everybody missed the dentist. - If we ever do a Trekkies 3. - Did they? A lot of people wanted a follow-up on the dentist. He's so memorable from the first one. This was a blast. We learned a lot about each other, travelling around the world. It was quite an experience. It was an Outward Bound experience. Yeah, that's true. Survival of the fittest. It was, and it's something that would be fun to do again. If they were all this fun. The biggest mistake on the first trip was we didn't allow any time to play, and that's why we had more nervous breakdowns on the first trip, but we learned, and built in a couple of vacation days everywhere we went. It made all the difference. Well, our travelling schedule was wild. It would have taken down lesser men. But we got through it. We had a lot of people to thank who helped us. There was no way we could have done this without their assistance, and all the Star Trek fans that we met, all the conventions. Seeing it now, there's so many people we didn't mention who were there for us and we thank you. Our apologies if we forgot you. We did our best. For credits, we tried to list everybody's name who actually speaks on camera. That was our criteria. - Do you think you did it? - I hope so. I don't know. You'll hear. If anyone sees a name discrepancy, drop us an email and we'll fix it. And if you're interested in Trekkies 3. Let us know if you're worth interviewing. We'll come to you. - We did it in this one. - We will find you. Subtitles by Philip Macdonald
