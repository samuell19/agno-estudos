KRAVCHENKO as Karaghina V. MURGANOV as Alexander I V. STRZHELCHIK as Napoleon In June of 1807, in Tilsit, the meeting of the emperors Alexander and Napoleon took place. In the meantime, life, the actual life of people, with its concerns of health, sickness, work, rest, and the interest people take in thinking, the sciences, poetry, music, love, friendship, hatred, passion, went on as usual, independently and outside of the political issue of friendship or war with Napoleon Bonaparte. January, February, March, April... Come on, speak, Mama. This won't do, my dear. Not everyone can understand your childhood friendship. Seeing you two being so close may be detrimental to you, and what's more important, it's making him wretched for nothing. He might have already found a good match, and now he's going crazy. Is he? I’ll tell you about myself. I had a cousin... I know, Kirill Matveyevich. But he's an old man. He was not always old. I’ll speak to Boris. He mustn't come so often. - Why not, if he wants to? - Because it can't come to anything. Mama, what nonsense! All right, I won't marry him, but let him come if we both enjoy it. Not to be married, but - just so... - How so, my dear? - Oh, just so. I don't want to get married at all. Just so... Stop laughing. You're shaking the bed. You're so much like me, just another giggler. Well, is he very much in love? What do you think? Did someone love you as much? Besides, he's very nice. Only not quite to my liking. He's so narrow, like the grandfather clock in the dining-room. - Do you know what I mean? - No. - Narrow, gray, light-colored... - What nonsense you talk! Don't you really understand? Nikolenka would understand. Bezukhov, for instance, is blue. Navy blue and red. And he's quadrangular. - You're flirting with him, too. - No, he's a Freemason. He's a darling, navy blue and red. How can I explain it to you? Countess, are you asleep? No one can understand all that I have in me. Sonya? No, how could she? She's too virtuous. Even mother can't understand me. It’s amazing how clever I am and... She is so charming. She's got everything. Extraordinarily intelligent, pretty, graceful. She swims, rides beautifully, and her voice! She's got a marvelous voice! On December 31, on the eve of the new year 1810, a Catherine court dignitary was giving a grand ball. The Czar and the diplomatic corps were expected to attend. The Rostovs were invited, too, and Natasha was preparing for the first great ball of her life. Sonya! That bow isn't right. Come here, will you? - Aren't you ready? It’s nearly 10. - Coming! - Are you ready, Mama? - I only have my cap to pin on. - Don't do it without me! - But it's ten o'clock already! Mavrusha, darling, hurry! - Aren't you ever going to be ready? - In a minute. Don't come in, Papa! Can it be that no one will ask me to dance? That no one will notice me? No, it can't be! They have got to know how I long to dance, how wonderfully I dance, and how glad they'll be to dance with me. This is indeed interesting... You always dance, don't you? I have a protégée here, the Rostov girl. - Will you ask her to dance? - Where is she? Excuse me, I’d be happy to go on with our talk some other time. But at a ball one should dance. I want you to meet my daughter. I have the pleasure of her acquaintance, if the Countess remembers me. Would you do me the honor for a waltz? If she goes to her cousin first, then to another lady, it will mean she will be my wife. Isn't this marvelous? Yes, it is. I’m very glad. Oh, that's you. I’ve been working. My dear, I have never experienced anything like that. I’m in love, my friend. - Well? - Mama, don't ask me anything now. - With Natasha Rostova? - Yes. Who else? This feeling is too strong for me. I wasn't really living until now. Only now I feel alive, but I can't live without her. How could she ever love me? I’ve never felt like this before! But I feel scared when I’m with him. Does that mean it's the real thing? - Why don't you say something? - Me? I’ve been telling you... - Mama, are you asleep? - No, my darling, I’m frightened. I know I won't sleep anyway. I never felt like this before! That girl is such a treasure... She's such a rare girl. I’m asking you, don't try to rationalize, have no doubts, marry her, and I’m sure that there will never be a happier man. - But how about her? - She loves you. - Nonsense, Pierre. - Yes, I know it. - I must talk to someone about it. - Go on, I’d be glad to. It had to happen that he came to St. Petersburg when we were here. And we had to meet at that ball. It was Fate, I’m sure. Yes, it must have been that. For me now, the world is divided into two. She is one part where you find happiness, hope and light. The other part is all where she isn't, and that's all gloom. Gloom and darkness. Yes, I know what you mean. Can a man help preferring light to gloom? I’m so happy. - I know you're glad for my sake. - Yes, yes. Mama, darling, how I love you! How happy I am! Three weeks went by. Not once did Prince Bolkonsky call on the Rostovs. Natasha, darling, perhaps he's ill. After all, he was wounded at Austerlitz. Please, don't, Mama! I don't want to think about him. He just started visiting us and then stopped. And I don't feel like getting married. I’m afraid of the man. I mean what I’m saying. Why think that much about it? Things are fine as they are. Yes, that's me! And I don't need anyone. What a charming creature that Natasha is! She's pretty, has a nice voice, she is young, she doesn't bother anyone. Just leave her alone! Mama, Bolkonsky is here! Mama, it's awful! I don't want to be tortured! Who's here? Why? Oh please, Natasha!.. It’s such a long time since we have had the pleasure... I haven't been to visit you because I had to see my father. There was something very important I had to talk to him about. I would like to speak to you, Countess. Go, Natasha, I will call you. Lord, have pity on me. Lord, please help me. Well, Mama? Go to him. He's asking for your hand. Can it be that this stranger has become everything to me now? Now he's dearer to me than anything else in the world. Since the very first minute I saw you I have loved you. Please say that I can hope. Why ask? Why doubt what it's impossible not to know? Why talk when you can't express with words what you feel? - Do you love me? - Oh yes, yes... - What is it? Is something wrong? - I feel so happy. Now, Prince Andrei no longer felt the same love for her as before. Something within him had changed. There was none of the former poetic charm of attraction, only a kind of pity for her feminine and childish weakness, a sort of terror before her devotion and trustfulness. Although this new feeling was not as poetic as the old one, it was stronger and more serious. Did your mother tell you that we cannot be married for a year? Is it possible that it's me?.. Is it possible that from now on I’m to be the wife, the equal of this stranger, who is so intelligent and charming, whom even my father looks up to? Can it be true that life is no longer a game, that now I’m responsible for everything I do and say? But what was it he asked me? You are so young, and I’ve already been through such a great deal. It’s for you that I’m afraid. You don't know yourself yet. Difficult as it is for me to wait an entire year, delaying my happiness, it will give you some time to test yourself. I’m asking you to make me happy in a year. But till then you are free. Our engagement will remain secret. And should you find that you do not love me... Why do you say that? From the first day you came to Otradnoye, I have loved you. In one year you will learn to know yourself. A whole year? Why wait a year? Can't anything be done? It’s frightening! I’ll die waiting a year! Why, it's so awful! No! I’ll do anything. I feel so happy! There was no ceremony and their betrothal was not announced to anyone. Don't go. I beg you, Natalie, God knows what may happen. Perhaps you will stop loving me... I know I shouldn't talk about that. But whatever may happen to you when I’m not here... Don't go... Whatever may happen, go to Pierre for help. He's the most absent-minded man, but he has a heart of gold. Don't go... How indignant Pierre would have been seven years before, when he'd returned from his sojourn abroad, if someone had told him that there would be no need for him to seek or plan anything, that his path had long ago been traced and predetermined for him. Sometimes he consoled himself that the life he led was a temporary thing. But then he would be shocked by another thought: how many other men had temporarily slipped into this sort of life, just as he had, with all their teeth and all their hair, only to leave it without a single tooth and without a single hair. Why? What for? What was going on in the world? Now and then Pierre recalled what he had been told of soldiers under fire in ambuscade when they have nothing to do, how they try hard to find occupation so as to bear their danger more easily. And Pierre pictured all men as such soldiers trying to find a refuge from life, some in ambition, some in cards, some in framing laws, some in women, some in games, some in horses, some in politics, some in sport, some in wine, some in the government service. Nothing is trivial, nothing is important. Only one thing matters: to escape from her as best I can! Only not to see her, that dreadful her. Under the influence of wine he would say to himself: "I’ll get it straightened out. I have a solution already. But I’ll think it over later on!” The trouble was this “later on” never came. Good morning, Uncle! All’s well and quick march! I knew you couldn't resist it. You had better attack at once, for my Girchik reported that the Ilaghins are out with their hounds at Korniki. They'll snatch the litter right under your noses. That's where I’m going. Shall we join the packs? Good morning, Uncle! See? We're going too! Good morning to you. Be careful you don't trample the hounds. We won't get in anyone's way. We'll stay in our places. A good thing too, little Countess, only don't fall off your horse, since there's nothing for a horse to hold on to. Have you seen Natalya Ilyinichna? Where is she? She and Pyotr Ilyich are standing behind the high grass at Zharov. A lady, but she has a great love for the chase. And you wonder at her riding, eh? - It wouldn't be amiss for a man. - Yes! So daring, so smart! You old hag, don't scare the game off, or old Danila'll curse you... I know a thing or two myself! They're on the track of the litter. In the Lyadovsky uplands. Stand still! There! He slipped by you! Some hunters! Dear Lord, what would it cost You to do this for me? I know it's a sin to ask You such a thing. But please, let the wolf come out my way! Just once in my life let me get a hermit wolf, that's all I want! Keep going or go back? Keep going! What a magnificent wolf! - A real hermit wolf, eh? - The meanest one, Your Excellency. As mean as you are, Danila. That's my little Countess, all’s well, quick march! I never saw an amazon like her! Dawn to sundown, riding sidesaddle, and she's as fresh as a daisy! Have a taste of this, little Countess. Come on, Petya, wake up! Taste some of this, it's delicious! This is how I’m finishing my days. When you die, there's nothing left at all. All’s well, quick march. So why complain... Open the door! Why have you shut it? That's my coachman. I’ve bought him a good balalaika. How nice! It’s really good. What do you mean, good? It’s simply enchanting! Please, go on! Play some more. You enjoy it, little Countess? He plays very well, doesn't he? That's not the way to do it. You should hear trills there, all’s well, quick march! Can you play, Uncle? Anisya, will you see if the strings are all right on the guitar? I haven't touched it for a long time, all’s well, quick march! Beautiful, Uncle! Go on! More! Please, dear Uncle! Now then, my dear niece... Where, when, how had this little Countess, reared in silk and velvet by a French governess, ever managed to absorb, with only the air she breathed, this manner that was so typically Russian? And yet the spirit and gestures were precisely and inimitably Russian, which her uncle expected to find in her. How did she manage to grasp everything that was in Anisya, in Anisya's father, in her mother, in every Russian man or woman? Well done, my little Countess! That's my niece! All you need now is to pick out a worthy young man for a husband! He's already picked out. Yes, and a very good one! What did Nikolai's smile mean when he said, “he's already picked out”? He acts as if he thought that my Bolkonsky wouldn't understand, wouldn't approve of this wonderful time we're having. But he would understand. Where is he now? But I mustn't think about him. Night has laid out a blanket Of the newly-fallen snow. Swept it over every pathway In the field of predawn glow. It’s not sorrow that's eating A good fellow, it's woe. A good fellow is grieving... - What are you thinking about? - Me? Wait. I was thinking that here we're driving thinking we're going home. But actually, we're going Heaven knows where and finally we'd arrive and find we weren't at Otradnoye, but that we were in a fairy land. And then I thought... No, that was all. -You were certainly thinking of him. - No. And also I was thinking how beautiful Anisya was. I know that I shall never be as happy as I am now. Nonsense, gibberish, folly. What a treasure my Natasha is! I have no other friend like her and I’ll never have. Why does she have to marry? We could have gone like this forever. What a treasure my Nikolai is. Oh, if he'd only come back sooner. I’m afraid we'll never get married. Worst of all, I’m getting older... I shall no longer be what I am now. But what if he comes today? Perhaps he came yesterday, and I’ve forgotten it? What am I to do with them? Oh yes, Nikita, will you please go and... Where am I to send him? Yes, will you please go to the yard and bring me a rooster? Nastasya Ivanovna, what shall I give birth to? You? Fleas. Dragon-flies, grasshoppers. Oh, my God, the same old thing. Where am I to go? What am I to do with myself? The Island of Mad-a-gas-car. Mad-a-gas-car. Madagascar. Do you feel sometimes that nothing is going to happen to you anymore, that everything good had already happened, and you feel not so much bored, as sad? Oh yes, very often! I remember moments, when everybody around is cheerful, it suddenly strikes me that I’m sick of it all, and all must die. I didn't go to a squadron party once, and there the music was playing, and I felt all at once so dreary. I know it. I know it. Even when I was quite little, I used to have that feeling. Do you remember, I was punished once for eating some plums, and you were all dancing, and I sat in the study sobbing? I shall never forget it. I felt so miserable and sorry for everyone. And what's most important, I wasn't to blame. I remember that I came to you later and I longed to comfort you. We used to be so funny. I had a dummy toy then, and I wanted to give it to you. - Do you remember it, Sonya? - Yes, I do remember something. How strange it is, as though it were a dream. I like that. And do you remember how Papa, in his blue fur coat, fired a gun off on the porch? Do you remember what fun it was?.. - They've brought a rooster, Miss. - Tell them to take it back. I think that when one goes on remembering and remembering, one remembers till one recalls what happened before one was in this world. That's metempsychosis. The Egyptians used to believe that our souls had been in animals, and would go into animals again. I don't believe we were once in animals, but I know for certain that we were once angels somewhere, and we have been here, and that's why we remember everything. If we had been angels, why should we have fallen lower? Not lower. Who told you we were lower? This is how I know I have existed before. The soul is immortal, you know. If I’m to live forever, that means I have lived for all eternity. But it's hard for us to conceive of eternity. Why is it hard? There's today, there will be tomorrow, and there will be forever, and yesterday has been, and the day before. The mummers are here! - Natasha! - Did you see? Did you see him? Yes. - Wait, I... saw him. - Standing or lying down? At first there wasn't anything. Then suddenly, I saw him lying down. - Lying down? Could he be ill? - No. His face was cheerful. What happened then, Sonya? I couldn't make it out. I saw something blue and red. When is he going to come back? When shall I see him again? I’m so afraid for him, and for myself, and about everything else... Prince Andrei wants his year reduced by three months. So write him and tell him to wait till I’m dead. It won't take long. Go ahead, marry, dear son. What a fine alliance! Smart people, eh? And rich, eh? And what a stepmother he's going to give poor Nikolushka! Let him marry tomorrow if he wants! And I’ll marry our governess! He mustn't be without a stepmother, either! But I’m not going to put up with any more women in my house! Would you like to live with him, too? Bon voyage and good riddance! Put the Count's things over here. The young ladies' - on the left. You've grown plumper and prettier. Phoo! How cold you are! Maria Dmitrievna, my Countess has gotten ill. Our house isn't heated. I took an opportunity of your invitation, and here we are. High time you did. I’m so glad you could come. The old Bolkonsky's in Moscow. His son is also expected any day. You really should make his acquaintance. His highness cannot see you, but her highness, the Princess, asks you to come up. You see, my dear Princess, I’ve brought you my little songstress. I’m so happy that you can get to know each other. I have long wanted to do so, Count. I’m very glad. I’m sorry to hear that the Prince is unwell. If you'll permit, Princess, I’d like to leave my Natasha in your hands for a quarter of an hour. I would like to drop in on Anna Semyonovna. Then I’ll come back and pick her up. Please spend the longest time possible at your friend's. My dear Natalie, I’m so delighted to see that my brother has found happiness at last. I think, Princess, that it's not opportune to talk about that now. Ah, Mademoiselle! Countess Rostova, if I am not mistaken? I beg your pardon. God is my witness, I didn't know that you've honored us with a visit. It was to my daughter that I came in this costume. Please excuse me. So help me God, I didn't know. I beg you to excuse me. After all, what do his father and sister matter to me? He's the one I love and he alone. No, I’d better not think of him. I’d better forget him for now. Look what a cap Anna Mikhailovna has on. That's the Karaghins with Julie and Boris. One can see they're engaged. Drubetskoy has made a proposal. I heard so today. How long have you been in town, Countess? I have some business here, too, and I’ve brought my girls with me. They say, Semyonova's acting is superb. Here he is, Kuraghin! I can't call on you. Does it mean I’ll never see you again? How madly I’m in love with you! Never to see you again? Natalie! Just one word! For the love of God! One word! Mademoiselle, a man asked me to give you this. Since last evening, my fate is sealed: To be loved by you or to die. I have no other choice. Forget all this. There's time yet. Stop talking nonsense. If you only knew what this means to me. I’m being serious. What you're planning is no joke. Stop teasing me! Go to the devil! I’ve helped you plan this, but you must be told the truth. This affair is dangerous, and when you think of it, it's stupid. All right, you'll take the girl away, but they won't let it go at that. They're going to find out you're married. They'll take you to court! Rubbish! Haven't I explained everything to you? If this marriage is invalid, I won't have to answer for anything. And if it's valid, in a foreign country no one will know a thing. So I don't want to hear about it any more. - You'll get your head in a noose. - You go to the devil! You don't understand what I’m going through. Just feel it beating. What a lovely foot she has! And the look in her eye! A pure goddess! -When your money's gone, what then? - What then?.. How am I to know what then?.. Don't talk nonsense. Sonya, I can't keep it from you any longer. We're in love. He's written to me, Sonya... And Bolkonsky? You can't imagine how happy I am! You mean you're breaking up with Prince Andrei? You don't understand anything. Stop this nonsense, listen to me. I’m not going to let you do it. I will tell. If you tell, then you're my enemy! You want to ruin my life. You can't meddle in such affairs. I confided in you... Why doesn't he come right out and ask for your hand? After all, Prince Andrei has given you complete freedom. You mustn't doubt him, Sonya, don't you understand? - What if he's not an honorable man? - I can't live without him! I don't understand you! Think of your father, of Nikolai! I don't need anyone! I don't love anybody except him! I don't want to quarrel. Please go! Don't you see that I’m suffering? Well, lads, friends of my youth, we have had jolly sprees together! Now, when shall we meet again? I’m going abroad. Farewell! - Let's get going! - And where's the sable coat? Ignatka! Go upstairs and ask for a sable coat! She'll come out nearly dead with fright, wearing whatever she had on. If you don't act fast, she'll get cold and want to go back. Then you wrap the coat around her and carry her over to the sleigh. You idiot! I said sable, didn't l? Come on, take it. I won't miss it. I shall demonstrate. That's the way. See? Giddyap! She will be out directly. - Will you come to the mistress? - What mistress? My orders are to bring you in. Kuraghin! We've been betrayed! Maria Dmitrievna, let me in to see her, for God's sake! Shameless girl! Wretched little hussy! A fine thing! Arranging meetings with lovers under my roof. Enough of those crocodile tears. Listen to me when I speak to you. You've disgraced yourself, like a common girl of the streets. I don't know what I’d have done if I didn't feel sorry for your father. A lucky thing for that scoundrel that he escaped, but he'll be found. Will you listen to what I’m saying? Let me alone. I don't care. I’m going to die! Natasha! I’m doing this for your own good. Now lie still, I won't touch you. What am I going to tell your father when he comes back tomorrow? -What if he and your fiance find out? - I have no fiance. I’ve broken up. Makes no difference. He'll find out. Do you think he'll keep quiet? He might even challenge that scoundrel to a duel. What then? Will you leave me alone? Why did you have to meddle? Who asked you to do that? Just what did you expect? Suppose he had kidnapped you? Do you think you'd get away with it? He's a scoundrel, that's what he is! He's better than any of you! Why did you have to interfere? Oh, merciful God, why? Sonya, why? Will you get out? Everyone hates me, despises me! You are worse than a cad. You're a scoundrel! Why am I denying myself the pleasure of smashing your head? - Had you promised to marry her? - I... I didn't think. Well, I couldn't make any promises because I’m married already. Have you any letters from her? I won't do anything to you, don't be afraid. I’ve got the letters. Now you will have to leave Moscow by morning. And one other thing. You'll never breathe a word about what happened. I know I can't prevent you from doing so, but if there remains in you a scrap of human conscience... If you must, go to women like my wife for your diversion. They know what you want, and so there you're within your rights. They're as well armed as you with the same experience of debauchery. But deceiving a girl whom you've vowed to marry... kidnapping her... Have you never been told that it's just as cowardly and infamous as killing an old man or a child? I wouldn't know and I really don't care to know. But you used certain words, like cowardly and so on, that I cannot condone as a man of honor. Although there are no witnesses, still I’m not going... You want satisfaction? You might at least take back your insults, if you want me to comply with your wishes. I take back my words and ask you to forgive me. And should you need any money for your journey... What a breed you are! Mean, sordid, heartless! Her letters and her portrait. Would you return them to the Countess? She is very ill. So she is still here? And Prince Kuraghin? He left long ago. She almost died. I’m very sorry to hear of her illness. I take it, Monsieur Kuraghin did not honor her with his hand? He couldn't marry because he was already married. And where might your brother-in-law be now, if I may ask? He left for St. Petersburg... Actually I’ve no idea where he is. You may tell Countess Rostova she's always been and remains free, and that I wish her every happiness. Do you remember that discussion we had in St. Petersburg... Yes, I told you that one should forgive a fallen woman. But I never said I would be able to. I can't forgive. But can this be compared? Once more to ask for her hand, to be magnanimous? I am not up to following the same path as that gentleman. If you want to be my friend, don't talk to me again about that... about all this. Well, goodbye. Pyotr Kirillovich, Prince Bolkonsky is your friend. He once told me I could come to you for help. Now the Prince is here... Could you tell him to... to please forgive me? - Yes, I will tell him, but... - I know everything's finished. What torments me is that I have hurt him so. Can you tell him that I beg him to forgive me for everything. Yes, I’ll tell him. I will do as you ask. Only I’d like to know one thing... I would like to know whether you loved... Did you love that evil man? You mustn't call him evil. I don't know anymore. Then we won't speak of it again, my dear. I will tell him everything, but you must think of me as your friend. If you ever need help, if you feel like confiding in someone, not right now, but when you can see in yourself more clearly, remember I’m your friend. If there's anything I can do, I would be happy... Please don't be so kind. I don't deserve it! Don't say that! Your whole life still lies ahead of you. No! For me, everything's finished. Everything is finished? If I were somebody else, somebody who was good-looking, intelligent and the best of men, and if I were free, I would be right now at your feet asking for your hand and your love. It seemed to him that this dazzling comet was the perfect symbol of what he felt in his compassionate soul which brimmed with the blossom of a new life. On June 12, the armies of Western Europe crossed the Russian border, and the war began, an event completely opposed to human reason and human nature. End of Part Two
