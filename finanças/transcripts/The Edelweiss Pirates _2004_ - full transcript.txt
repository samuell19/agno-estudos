Testing one, two. Okay, that'll work. I'm going to tell a story that l never wanted to tell, and no one wanted to hear anyway. But as l'm going to die soon, l'll say what l have to say to this thing here, and those who come after me can do whatever they want to with it. L'll stick to the truth as best l can. It was in March 1945. The Americans were already in Cologne when the Gestapo took us from our cells. Out, quickly! Hurry! Out of there! - Faster! Forwards! Faster! Move it! Get back! In the name of the Father, the Son... These damn files! - Ready! Aim! The prisoners who were arrested by my unit... No! I applied fortheir immediate liquidation! The prisoners are lined up. We're waiting for orders. The line's dead. Oh yeah? The line's dead? Look out of the window. Get out of here! Afterthe Americans had liberated us, l felt nothing... no joy, no relief. I wanted to scream, but l couldn't. Everything that had happened turned over in my mind. 1 1/2 years before l'd been living with my brother Peter in Marien Street. We had moved there after Mom was killed in a bombing raid. Dad was still fighting on the front. Our older brother Otto had died fighting in Russia. Turn it off! I wanna hear it! I told you that before! Turn it off! Sorry for listening to music that Dad likes! I want to listen to it! Are you nuts? Are you crazy? Are you crazy? Okay, come on! My cap! My friends and l were Edelweiss Pirates, and we mostly roamed the streets. We used shortcuts to get around town, so the Nazis couldn't catch us. The railroad path was a favorite... and it went past Cilly's house. Giddyup, horse! Faster! Faster! Faster! Faster, horse! Go inside and wash yourselves. Well, how are we doing today? I'm starving... lt's too cold. - The first thing l'm gonna do... Maybe l can help you. - How? Be a good girl and you'll get everything you want. Come back when you've been to the Welfare Office. Come on, Karl! My mom's gonna beat me black and blue. Bubbes, Günther, Barthel and Dölfes were my best friends. We weren't the only Edelweiss Pirates in Cologne. There were thousands of us. We were different from the Hitler Youth. We wore edelweiss badges, we liked different songs, and we even had girls in our group. Hitler Youth! Spread out! Attack! Come here, asshole! Damned pirates! Come on, guys! Let's get outta here! Come on! Let's get outta here fast! Scatter! Nobody here! What are you doing? - L'm gonna set it off. Get outta here, Vladimir. You're crazy. Move it! I gotta pee. - Stop! I can't... do it... when others watch. Go on. We'll take a break. - No, we gotta guard him. Halt! Get up, you bastard! There's that asshole Soentgen! Just like l said. They're going to the bomb shelter. Aren't we going there, too? Edelweiss Pirates lead a dangerous life. Didn't you know that most people die in bomb shelters? Come on! Come on, hurry up! How do you spell "madness"? - The paint's dripping. Hurry up! - Write carefully! Hey! - Damn it! Hurry! That's enough! - Let's get outta here! Hurry up! - Wait for me! I'm gonna take a pee. Don't catch a chill. - He's always gotta pee. That was a close call! - We showed 'em! D'you think they can read it? - They'll have to make an effort. I'm really starving. You're such a hog. - Somebody's lying there! Careful! - Here's another guy! Don't get all bloody! - Don't touch it! You shouldn't rob dead people! I think he's still alive. He's alive. - He's a prisoner! Forget it! He's none of our business! - No, we gotta hide him! This means trouble. - Overthere! Careful! - You have to pull him! You have to pull him! Nearly made it! - L hope nobody'll find us here! You think they'll be back? What's that? - A search squad. Move it, Jupp. Don't worry. We won't betray you! Wait! He's slipping! That's better. - Olli is heavy. I don't believe it! - L don't get it: Why'd you let Steinbrück get away? He's defused more than 1,000 bombs. He was our best man. Are you gonna report me? - No! l'll say he was blown to bits. Up he goes! L'll neverforget you forthis. Let's go. He can't stay with me. That's why you're here, right? I have otherthings to worry about. Here, read this. They want to take away Anton and Flitzi? Soentgen gave me the letter. He said he'd go to the Welfare Office for me, if... That pig! He's been after me since Otto died. If you need somebody, Cilly... l mean, l'm Otto's brother... We could... get married. Thank you... Thank you, Karl. But l need somebody who's grown up. Two friends of ours found a device to blow up bridges. Since you know how to defuse bombs, maybe we could... Blow up a bridge? Or an ammunition supply train. Aweapons factory. Ambush a food warehouse. Don't bite off more than you can chew! Catch it! - L can play soccer, too! Go get it, Anton! Help! - Anton! Flitzi, l'm stuck! Anton! Don't move! l'll get Mama! Anton! Where are you? Be careful! - Hurry! Overthere! - Take cover! Flitzi! Hans is gonna defuse the bomb! - No! - Get outta here! Get down! Get down! No! Everything's okay, kid. Come on. Easy does it. Now! Go on! Go on! A bit lower. We have to turn him. That's fine. Let's put him on the bed. He's sweating. Thanks, Karl. l'll manage. Thanks. - Okay. What's your name? Cilly. See you later. "Dear Dad, How are you doing? When will you be getting leave? There are a lot of things we have to talk about, but l can't put them in a letter. My friends and l found a half-dead cat. It's at Cilly's place, and we're doing all we can to get it back on its feet. Barthel gets leftovers for it from his sister ..." Hi, Annemie. Where'd you get the bread? - L'm not gonna tell you. Look! I'm gonna tell Mama! "Günther's grandpa got buried by rubble during a bombing raid. He hasn't stopped shaking since then. Maria, Günther's aunt, moved in with them. She's the one who fixed up the cat ..." Auntie? Can l give Hans half the bread? - Yes. - Thank you. "The cat had almost frozen to death. Dölfes got a warm blanket for it. Kratina the tailor has moved in with them. Father Schütz forbade it, but his mothertold him not to make a fuss. He runs after other women himself, and he's a drinker, too. Bubbes kisses Anneliese's grandma on the hand and Anneliese on the mouth. Then he goes for her goods. Flitzi and Anton are fine. Cilly got a load of coal from Hüppeler. Since then she's been able to heat her hovel. Afew butterflies have hatched, 'cause they think it's summer. Flitzi's school burned down, which doesn't seem to bother her. Anton was trapped under a bomb. It was a miracle he got out alive. The kids have to be quiet because of the cat. Cilly spends the whole day looking afterthe cat, but she has to watch out, because cats can scratch. I hope it gets well soon. Then it can look after itself. What do you think, Papa? Was it right to help the cat? Nothing's really changed here. Peter's asleep, like always after doing duty forthe Hitler Youth. He lives in a dream world. He has no idea what's really going on. I'm getting tired of lying to him all the time. You understand what l mean? I often feel like screaming, but my throat gets all choked up. Your son, Karl." Hey... Have you heard? They landed in France. The war's gonna be over soon. Hey, is everything okay? Morning, sleepy head. Where's Hans? The war's gonna be over soon. - Quiet! EDELWElSS PlRATES STAY TRUE l'm with you now. L'll take care of you. Hold out your arms! That's enough! Hey, Karl. - Hi. Give us a hand. Make yourself useful. Boy, it sure is dirty here! - Come on, guys. Let's have a smoke. Wait for me. l'm coming, too. Here. Foryou. Where'd you get this? - L found it. Thanks. - You can do me a favor, too. Okay? - Okay. - Fine! Get outta here! Get outta here! All you wanted was a gun and an lD. What's wrong with you, huh? - What's wrong with me? My brother and Cilly... were engaged. The kids are his kids, too, and... - What? Your brother's dead. I'm looking after Cilly now. -You? You? You're putting her in danger. It is the second time, since the Jews started this war, that such a heinous attempt has been made to assassinate our Führer. Our Führer remained uninjured. They tried to kill Hitler. But he's still alive. These attacks are proof of the enemy's pathetic nature. He pretends the war is won... We have nothing left to eat. ...but has ceased to believe that war will be won on the battlefield. L'll be right back. I know what we're eating tonight. It's me... Hans. Remember me, Hueppler? Well, if it isn't Bomber Hans! I heard you were living in the neighborhood with Cilly Serve. L'd sure like to put up at her place, too. Bullshit! You know where to get food? - L gotta think about that. Damn it! l'm scared! Let's get outta here! Are you crazy? Hey, that's more than 20 hundredweight! Worth 120,000! - Butter! Loads of butter! Outta the way, Moll! What're you gonna do with your money? - Buy a car. And you? I'm gonna give it to Nazi welfare. - You missed! Oh! l was hoping he'd ask me. You guys have to dance, too. You, too, Dölfes. I don't feel like it. It's your big chance. - l don't feel like it. lt's Cilly's turn today. Let me go! Time to go to bed, kids! Anton! Why d'you let the Nazis make fools of you? -We fight back! How? By fighting with the Hitler Youth? What do you wanna do? Here, you can use this to buy all kinds of weapons and ammunition. Then what? Then we'll blow up Gestapo Headquarters. What a bunch of bullshit! I thought that was biting off more than we can chew? You're all just cowards! Hey... l'm no coward! You can count me in. I'm with you. Count me in, too. Me too. What about you, Karl? Let's do it. You guys are beyond help. - We're gonna do it! Foryou. He's fine. What did he write to you? Heil Hitler! Karl and Peter Ripke? Be brave, boys. Yourfather... was a war hero. He died forthe Führer, his people and his fatherland. It isn't easy for me to break this news to people. They call me... the Angel of Death. Do me a favor, okay. Tell Cilly Serve l'm stopping by tonight. I need a little pick-me-up... if you know what l mean. Heil Hitler! "Dear Karl, lt's always raining here. My boots are rotten through. This war is different than any of us ever imagined. Remember what we last talked about? You were right. We can't always hide from the truth. Stay true to yourself. Only that is important. Look after Peter. Don't tell him what l wrote. He wouldn't understand it yet. We have to stick together, now that Mama and Otto are dead. Give my regards to Cilly and the kids. And keep your chin up. We'll play soccer when l get back. Yourfather." Hey, Karl! Karl! - Leave me alone, Lorent! I'm on a Nazi hunt. Wanna join me? - What's that mean, "Nazi hunt"? I'm gonna shoot Nazis! You should shoot that guy, Soentgen. He tells the widows their husbands died in battle, then he screws 'em. Stop it! Are you crazy? - Hey! You told me to do it! Damn it. Karl! What's wrong? Papa is dead. Soentgen told us. But he's dead now, as well. Is Karl here? Here... Why didn't you tell me? Who are you? Peter. What's wrong? Ourfather died in battle. Sorry to hearthat. He was against the Nazis. He hated the war. Why didn't he evertell me? What difference would that have made? L'd have quit the Hitler Youth. I was only there for Papa's sake. Have you ever shot a gun? A bit. Here... take it. Aim at the bucket. It's good. It sure is good. Yes? - Hello. ls Miss Serve in? No, she isn't here. When will she be back? I'm from the Welfare Office. So what. - Hello. I've been asked to investigate Cäcilie Serve's children, Felicitas, 7, Anton, 5, regarding child neglect. The children haven't been neglected. You have my word. Who are you? Cilly's cousin, the head of the family. You're dealing with me now. I have to see the children. You old dried-up cunt! Get outta my home before l give you hell! You really gave it to her. She won't be back. Bulls eye! - lt sure is loud! Not bad. - Here. What's wrong? - Lt's jammed. - Let me see. Got it? Fire! Stop it! Stop shooting! I already told you, no guns in my home! Cilly, we have to defend ourselves! That's right. But you don't want to defend yourself! You want revenge! No matter what, something's gotta be done. - Right. Come on. Here! "Workers and soldiers! Stop working forthe war effort! Fight the Nazis! The People's Front" These are leaflets. Listen... We need someone to buy paper. Who's gonna read that? The Nazis will laugh their heads off. L'll buy the paper. Are you stabbing me in the back? I don't want to be like them. Here you are. L'll get the rest from the back. Just a moment, please. There's a suspicious woman. She wants 2000 sheets. - So much? You must call the Gestapo! - L'll go out and keep her busy. Yes, do that! My sister is getting the paper. It will just take a second. L'll see how she's doing. She's run away. You called us? - She went... -Where is she? She ran around that corner. - You could've said so sooner. Around that corner. I was getting worried. This is all l could get. I think they suspected me. Take this. - No, Maria. Before they shoot you. This is my wife Cilly. And this is Ruth und Friedel Krämer. - Hello. - Hello. This is our new guard dog. He can guard the place when Flitzi and Anton are alone. Secret police! Hands up! Peter Hüppeler? Overthere! - Move it! Get 'em outta here! Get moving! Hip, hip, hooray! Hip, hip, hooray! Hip, hip hooray! Blow out the candles and make a wish. Happy birthday, Peter! - Thank you. Happy birthday! Thanks, Günther. - Now you're one of us. Now you're an Edelweiss Pirate. It really suits him! - Hey, Peter. Here, from me foryou. Hey, Hans, a genuine Patzke! It's nothing special. Thanks. Karl! - lt's Karl! It's him! - Hi, Karl. - How're you doing? We thought you'd croaked. - Have you seen my car? I wanted to tell you happy birthday. I have something foryou. - Thanks. Let me see! Don't stick your nose into everything! - Oh no! Not another harmonica! - L already have one... from Hans. A genuine Patzke. But thanks anyway. Let's dance. Come on. Captain Kutter, we picked this guy up during our raid this morning. He told us about the terrorists in Ehrenfeld. They wanna blow up our headquarters. Hoegen! They're great tango dancers! He never dances with me like that! Hey, Rheinberger! Up, Barthel! - Here we go! Bravo! - Bravo, Barthel! Wanna marry me, Cilly? What's this? I asked you a question. Wanna marry me? What is this? Tell me what it is! That welfare lady wanted to know if the kids are neglected. Wanna marry me, Cilly? - What did she say? I sent her away. I threw her out. I told herto piss off. Do you realize what you've done? You can kill yourself, but don't kill the kids, and don't kill me. What d'you want, Cilly? - l want my kids to survive this bloody war! Understand? Gimme some, too! Don't drink it all! You bastard, tell us who the leader of those terrorists is. The leader is... Bomber Hans. Good boy. Where's the gang's hideaway? 7 Schönstein Street. Hoegen, wake up the men, the whole unit. And this guy... is coming with us. Hoegen speaking. A big operation at 7 Schönstein St. At once! Stop it, Hans! - That's enough! - Help him! Stop it! - That's enough! Let me go! Hey! Stop it! Get lost, you traitor! - What's the problem? It wasn't like that. Get lost! All of you! Get outta here! This is your home, Cilly. You decide who leaves. Not him! Stop it! You guys should leave now. L'll manage it on my own. Peter... You can't stay, Hans. You have to go, too. Damn it! Flitzi! - Mama! -Anton! Where is he? - Who? Who d'you think? Let go! - Let go of the children! - Let me go! Stop it, Flitzi! Calm down! Stop it! Please let go of the children! Stop it! Stop it! Please! Where is he? - He's gone. I threw him out. 10 minutes ago. I'm gonna ask you again... Where is he? I don't know. He's gone. Let go of the children. Those are the terrorists? No, they aren't. What'll it be? - A beer and a schnapps. We're outta schnapps. Hans. Lorent, Roland. They got a whole arsenal down there. And these are Jews. They even showed me their lDs. - Come on, Ruth. Hoegen... Where's their leader? Where is he? - l don't know. But you know, don't you? Bomber Hans... will be back. What? He'll come back for Cilly. He loves her. What do we do now? Leave? No, we'll stay here until he comes back. Aren't l right? Are you crazy? Gimme something to drink, too! I love her. My wife? Bullshit! Cilly! l'm going home. Hey! We were gonna go out hunting Nazis! - Later! Hey, you stinking coward! You can't... Hans. - Maria? They got Cilly. - Günther! What? - The Gestapo is at her place. Cilly is their decoy. They're waiting foryou. L'll kill 'em. - Come on. We'll kill 'em all. They're just waiting foryou to run in there, so they can kill you. And they'll shoot Cilly and the kids, too. You gotta get outta here, Hans! Hans! There are too many of 'em. You don't stand a chance. What's up? - What're you doing here? Let him in. Hi, Hans. What's up? The Gestapo is holding Cilly prisoner! We have to free her! Are you with us, Karl? Yeah. Go get the others. - Yeah, we'll do it. We'll meet in Licht Street. - Okay. Don't drink so much, Lorent. I don't believe it. Karl! - What're you doing here? What d'you think? We're hunting Nazis. Remember what we did to Soentgen? - Shut up! Hey! - Who's that? Gustav. We were on our way to the movies. Rheinberger, show him how to shoot. This is a P 38. This is the front... - L need your help. We gotta free her. If you aren't coming, then go home. Everybody else gets a gun. Don't. - Let me be! I'm not a little kid! - We'll surprise 'em. It's our only chance to free her. On the light signal, both cars meet in Schönstein Street. Pull yourself together, you idiot! - Stop it! L'll go in the back way, and you guys start firing. L'll come out with Cilly and the others, and we'll drive away. - Sounds good. Anybody want a sandwich? - Yeah. Who's gonna go in with me to get her out? I could do it. L'll go with you. You gotta give us cover when we come out the front door. We'll attack when it gets dark. - We're gonna shoot up the SS! Ah! - Are you crazy? There are some of those pigs! Are you nuts? - What're you doing? I don't give a damn! Hey, there are some more rats! This is like a nuthouse here! You're totally insane! I hope l shot one of 'em! Stop it, you bastard! Drunken idiot! Yuck! Okay, l'm finished. Come on now! Come on! Let go of the child, please! Put this on! L'll bring you back home! I promise. Promise you'll be brave. - Come on! Come on! You stay here! Mama! Afteryou. You stay here in case they come. Hey, come here. Come on. See you in a minute. Good luck. Let's go! Turn off the light! - Yes, sir. Stop! - Brake, you idiot! Stop! - Damn it! Get out! Get out! Damn it! Go! Get outta here! - Yes, sir. They're gone! - Damn it! Peter! Peter! What's wrong? Let's get outta here, Peter! Get in! Quick! - Wait for me! There they are! Fire! - We gotta go! Shut up! - They'll get us! We're goners! Hans? They took Cilly away. I'm gonna kill 'em all! - You can't get her back! Don't touch me! Wait for me! Wait! I don't understand. There's nothing to understand. They've gone crazy. There's nobody here. - L'll get the Gestapo man. Up there! They're all running away! I got one! I can't get 'em. L'll go around the back. Hands up! Get lost, kid. It's no use. There's nobody here. Wait a second. There he is. We can't leave him here. Come on, help me. Hurry. On the bed. That looks bad. He needs a doctor. No, Peter. We can't help him anymore. We gotta go. We can't leave him here. - They're looking for us. We have to leave Cologne! I'm staying with him. I'm not gonna leave. Stop trying to be a hero! They're gonna kill you if you stay here! I don't care. You're coming with me! - No! You're coming with me! You're coming with me! Shoot me. Go on, shoot me. Go with him. No! Idiot! Maria! Maria! Adolf Schütz? Hey, kid. Can you tell me where your brother is? Barthel! Barthel! Got anything to eat? - Gestapo! Halt! Don't move! You're staying here! - Let me go! Within just a few hours, the Gestapo had arrested all my friends. Sooner or later, they'd find Peter and Hans, too. I had to do something to save Peter, and all l could think of was what l ended up doing. What's up? L... l... Not so fast, buddy boy. You're gonna come with me and tell me what's going on. Shut up, you damn mutt! Well? If you... lf you let me and my brother go... l'll tell you where Steinbrück is. Sit down. Where is he? L'll tell you... if you let us go. Let me tell you something. I can't just let you go. But l can make sure you stay alive. You gotta do me a favor, though. What? When the war's over, say that l saved your life. You got me? But don't tell my brother l came to see you. Okay. So that's it! Get outta here! Get him outta here! Peter! Run away! - Hans! We got the reply from Berlin. "Ernst Kaltenbrunner, Head of the Secret Police of the Security Division of the SS and the RSHA. Your request to publicly liquidate 13 Germans in Cologne Ehrenfeld has been approved. The selection of persons to be executed is at your discretion. However, we draw your attention to the fact that in the case of Germans, highly incriminating evidence is required. In orderto create a deterrent effect, meticulous care must be taken to ensure that the persons being executed do not cause a disturbance, especially one of a verbal nature." We need statements, Hoegen. You're a good dog, Ricki. Wanna tell us something? Nothing. - Nothing? What, you don't know? What about Gestapo headquarters? - No idea. What don't you know? - We wanted... to steal things... - Steal things, huh? What are you trying to tell me? Who was there? l want names. I'm not gonna give names! - What? - l'm not gonna give names! Okay. Let's try something else. I'm gonna get you. Here we go. - Barthel... Bartholomäus Schink. Günther Schwarz. Peter Ripke? You wanna hang him? As a deterrent. - He's just a kid. - Yes, as a deterrent... Hoegen. To teach that Edelweiss gang how to behave in the future. Why don't we hang the woman instead? Publicly hang a woman with two little kids ...? You'd have to accuse her of more than just an affair with a prisoner. She bought loads of paper to print Communist leaflets. Communist agitation? If you can prove it... l can. ljust need a little time. "Workers and soldiers, Stop working forthe war effort! Don't go to the front. Fight with us for peace. Forthe People's Front. Forfreedom, against the Nazis. The People's Front." Does that ring any bells? Does it? You bought the paper. Hans told me everything. So tell us now, how much did Cilly know? She knew those were Jews that you were hiding there. Cilly isn't particularly bright... ..."upstairs". She cooked and took care of the kids. She didn't know anything else. She wasn't aware that you'd set up an arsenal, huh? Say: "Yes, she knew about it!" Did she know about it? She didn't know about the leaflets either? I told her l worked for... the fire department. She didn't know anything. Hans! I know how l'll get him to talk. Leave me alone with him. Okay, give it a try. But not too long. Mr. Möller, lunchtime. Listen, kid. You and your brother aren't like the others, right? Steinbrück made you do it. - That isn't true. Idiot! All you have to say is: "Steinbrück made me do it." Understand? I can't help you now. Get on the table. You idiot! Just say: "Steinbrück made me do it," and you won't be hanged. I'm gonna go out now. And when l come back in, what are you gonna say? Huh? You say: "Steinbrück made me do it." Understand? L'll help you get outta here. He said that Steinbrück made him do it. That isn't true! You just told me that Steinbrück made you do it. No. - What did you tell me? First he said Steinbrück made him do it, and now? I'm fed up with this. You're gonna be hanged anyway. What a shame. Peter! Can nobody hear me? -Who are you? - Lt's me, Dölfes. Is that you, Barthel? - Who are you? - ls that you? I want something to drink! Help! Get us outta here! Peter! Can you hear me? Yeah. Did they interrogate you? - They wanna kill us all! Peter, l don't want you to die! Can you hear me? -Yeah. Is everything okay? It's strange. I'm not afraid of dying. I'm just afraid they'll make me talk. I don't wanna betray Hans. I betrayed you. Everything's okay. I go my way, and you go yours. 10 November, 1944 There they are! That's one of 'em. Out of the way. Over here! Hurry! Here we are. You see? That's him there. Did you see my new badge? Attention! And, off! Anton! Mama! Anton! My little boy. - L waited foryou, Mama. Mama! Mama! Flitzi! Where were you, Mama? You can't take them with you. They're in state custody. Stop! Let them go! Karl! Just a moment... Just a moment! I saved his life. He can testify for me. Say something. I tried to save your brother's life. Is he telling the truth? No! You can't do that, Karl! I did everything to save your damn brother's life! Your damn brother wanted to die! Your brother was a good-for-nothing! - No! -Weak! - No! He was weak! - No! No! No! No! Edelweiss Pirates That's the story l wanted to tell. What's left to be said? Joseph Hoegen served 9 years in prison. Afterthat, he opened a grocery store in Braunsfeld, Cologne. Cilly died in the 1970s. I believe that Ruth Krämer and her mother went to America. The Edelweiss Pirates were honored in 1984 at lsrael's Yad Vaschem Memorial. I wanted to tell their story here, so they wouldn't be forgotten. It's great that Gustav got us the paint, isn't it? -Yeah. Rio... ...de... - What're you doing? I'm practicing my writing. ...Janeiro. I love... ...all women. I love all women! When is the... ...damn war ever going to end? Exclamation mark! - Hunger! Edelweiss... ...Pirates. Screw you! Karl loves Cilly. Subtitles John R.
