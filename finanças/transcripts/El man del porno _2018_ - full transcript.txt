First... Isolate yourself from the outside world. Second... Relax. Let it all begin. In the end, this is where I belong, where I can be myself. Third... Hold it hard. Hold it, guys. This looks fantastic. More rhythm. Beautiful, damn it. Prince, show me Celeste's ass. That's it. Careful with your mouth, Celeste. Close it a bit. Nice. - Ready. - All right, Amanda. Come in. You'll see your husband with the maid. Complain about it. If you want to hit him, that's okay. Should I approach him or her? As you wish. Please play with her for a while so you can have a threesome. Go. That's it. Prince, grab her hair. Move your head back. That's it. This is so hot! I love it. - What's happening? - Oh, no. So that's how you spend our time when I'm away. But nobody can have fun in my sofa if I'm not around. You're a very bad guy. That's it! I love it! It's so good! Camera on the three of you. I like that. Amanda, I'm filming your face. Move your head back. Your hair. That's it. Close your mouth a bit. - Pao. - I'm with you. - Filming your face. - Pao. Celeste's hair is casting a strange shadow on Amanda's face. Celeste, please move your hair. There's a shadow on Amanda. There you go. I'm on the three of you. Let's spice that threesome up, guys. Amanda, oral and penetration. A soft change. That's hot. Very good. There you go. That's it, Amanda. What happened? Careful with time! You need to cut. - Come take a look. - Just say no. That's it. Wonderful. I love it. I love your face, Celeste. Damn it! Carlos Andres! Cut! Honey, should we have lunch then? - Yes, yes. - Lunch break! All of my friends had to hide to watch porn. To me... it was rather a family matter. - Really? - Yes. You can say anything you want. Fill it up with milk, fuck me... She's Paola, my sister. My parents and I caught her... six or seven times screwing her boyfriend. She left the door open. She didn't care. She didn't even blush. This is her husband, Steven. He's like the brother I never had. They came up with this business idea together. He's the producer and she's the director. The money situation at home wasn't very good because dad was an unlucky gambler, so they decided to involve my parents in the production company. Dad accepted gladly. He was appointed as the accountant as long as... he stopped gambling. He says he hasn't gambled for two years. But I don't believe that shit. Things with mom weren't easy. But in the end, business is business. She's very smart, and as she says, it doesn't matter where money comes from. What matters is what you do with it. Let's pray. And since my parents were in a better position, I went to college. The usual. Like a normal family. Up until that moment, I was Carlos Andres Sanabria. But soon, I'd become Donato Roca. "THE PORN DUDE" Flesh... That sin of the flesh leads to excess. That sin... that temptation... is this world's search for immediate satisfaction. It can happen to everyone. Everyone can fall into temptation. That's why we must have a strong faith. We can't continue... I already told you. I thought we had made that decision. We must set an example. You decided yourself, honey. He arrived drunk to the set. He could't get it up. - I won't work with him. - Baby... I already told him. He promised he won't get drunk. He promised he won't even go out the night before. Steven. The shooting starts in a week. I won't take that risk. Stefano is my go-to guy. What's the problem with Stefano? None. He's got a big dick. - Well... - He does, he does. And he delivers. We've worked with him a lot of times. - He doesn't speak English. - Please! Respect God's home! In your second year, you don't know much about life. You restarted your studies, didn't you? Why are you like that? Seriously, I want to be a production assistant. I don't want to work with the camera or the lights. Not now. Maybe when the shooting is not that important. You're in charge of sound and you're good. I know, but I'm tired of being the boom guy. Anyone can do it. Okay. Sorry, I can't. You know? You should thank me. You're gaining experience and making money. What's the problem? I want to do something important. Something where I can be useful. You're so stupid. Are you listening to yourself? Sound is obviously important. Porn is mostly about sound. All right, all right. I know sound is important. Swear I'll be the production assistant next time. I won't swear that. No. What about working on lights with Anibal? You're always playing around with Anibal. Show me and we'll see. You won't allow me to demonstrate what I'm good at. - Carlos Andres? - So now I'm the bad guy? - Paola? - Unbelievable. All right, all right, Father. Thank God, we've had a lot of work. - Right, Paola? - Yes. It's true. Ask the Father to go and bless our business. What? Don't you dare ask me for a better job. - Please bless us, Father. - Oh. God bless you. I have to go to college today. I wish I didn't have to go to study. Being visible enough so that people noticed when I wasn't around, but also being isolated enough to avoid making excuses when I was invited to do something. I loved being unnoticed. Not calling anyone's attention. Being away without people missing me. I didn't want anyone to notice me... and I didn't want to notice anyone. Well... except for Erika. Erika Aristizabal. I had noticed her... and I couldn't stop looking at her. Hi... - Hi. - Hi. Are you the porn dude? - Sort of. - Really? - Yes. - Good. That's great. For my Sociology and Vanguard class, I have to write a paper on the representation of gender and sexuality. I must talk to someone who has worked in a porn movie. Have you... Have you worked in...? I'm the production assistant. But I also do other things like sound... No, no, so you're not. Do you know anyone who is actually a professional? I am a professional. The instructor said it had to be someone who had been sexually exposed and degraded himself... Degrade? I don't think that's the right word to use. It is not? I think it's good. I'll give you someone's contact info. You will? Really? Oh, thanks a lot. Indeed. Talk to you tomorrow. Thanks. Shit. Now she knows about me. I was no longer the guy who didn't say hi to anyone... to become the porn dude. What could I do? It was our family business and it was thriving. Paola had just closed a business to export porn movies with Josh, an American who realized that porn was much more fun and less dangerous than drugs. From Colombia to Miami with love. Suddenly, the movies we made as a family weren't called "Three Hot Bitches in a Hot Tub" anymore. They became "Horny Latinas Don't Pay with Cash." We made money in dollars. Real money. - Amanda Sweet... - Okay. I have some news, family! We're going to work with some Americans! - Cheers, cheers. - Thank God! - Cheers. - Cheers. Cheers. So what they want is... two scenes in a farm, because they want a sunny outdoor location and all that, and the other five... The thing about being part of the family business is that everyone knows what their role is. Well, everyone except me. Nothing is as dangerous as being available. Carlos Andres can help us with the bookkeeping. Right, son? Of course, working with him meant I had to do every fucking thing. Yes, Rodrigo. I think accountancy, bookkeeping and numbers, that's not my thing. There you go. Son, what's your thing then? You've changed careers twice. You haven't finished any because they weren't your thing. Sound isn't your thing. Education isn't either. And why do you call me Rodrigo? Working with your family sucks. Especially when everyone knows what their role is and I'm the only idiot in the family who hasn't figured out what he wants. I had to find out what I was good at. Let's put our hands in our customers' pockets. This will be all about post-erotism. Careful with the boom. We have already read this scene but we'll go over it again. All right. So... the pizza guy brings a delivery to her customer's house. She has no money and she decides to pay him with a blow job. Got it? Remember, real action starts after. All right. I'd like to add that when the pizza guy arrives, I open the box. I see it doesn't have any extra spicy chorizo so I decide to look for it. Wait a minute. There's something I don't get. Do I expect her to give me a blow job or is it her idea? If it were my idea, some foreplay would be required, maybe some neck kissing, nipple biting... something like that, right? Sure, prince. I think all of that works. But I received a special request from Miami. They don't want much foreplay, but action. All right. However, it works as an excuse for the characters to get to that point. For example, the chorizo and the prince... The lady's spicy taste. Exactly. That might work. - Let's rehearse and we'll see. - Yes. I got it. - Got it? - Perfect. - Are you okay? - Yes. Let's go, prince. - Good morning, everyone! - Good morning, Paola. We're going to rehearse. Paola, I don't know what's going on. We've been waiting for over an hour. We must start now or I'll go take a shower. I get it, baby. Let's fix it. What the hell is going on? This isn't working! It isn't working. We must shoot this scene and the one about the three girls. - I only have two hours. - Listen to me. Listen to you? This is for the Americans! Stefano's mom just died. What? She just died. Damn it! Is there any chance we can make the scene? Your mom would be proud if you fulfilled your duties, as usual. Come here. Let me hug you. That's it. It's just a scene. Very well paid. Very well paid! Talk to you then. Don't worry, prince. If you can't do it, no way. All right, all right. We'll talk later then. He just had an orgasm and won't get two in a row. - So no. - No. Okay. We're screwed. From my group, nobody can do it. One is injured and Daniel is in another movie in Pereira, so we can't make it. We won't make it. We're on a tight schedule to get the material ready and send the DVDs. If we don't do it, the fine... It is said that an opportunity arises when luck meets preparation. If that doesn't happen... But it doesn't matter. I didn't have any luck or preparation, but... I can do it. No! Obviously you won't. There must be another option. Another actor, I don't know... someone else who is... - Why not, Pao? - What? No. You won't be a porn actor, Carlos Andres. This is something serious. Stop talking so much bullshit. I'm being serious. If the producer can't pay for... Pao, we've talked to every actor we know. Even to the bad ones. We've lost an hour. You said it yourself. We can't afford that fine. So, so? Let's make a simple scene. Just a fellatio. A good blow job and that's it. - We'll make it! - I can do it. I said no! He doesn't even look like an American actor! We'll dye his hair! A couple of words in English! That's it. So now we must do it because you say so? Oh, that's nice. Well, no. It doesn't matter how many times we have to shoot. - Don't grab me. - Want some water? No. That'll make me want to pee. - Some valerian. - No, nothing. Some weed. It might be good for you. - You're making me nervous! - Enough! Ready, Pao? Ready, Pao? I can't do it... I can't do it. I'll wait for you outside. Will you do it? - I'll take care of it. - Okay. All right. Let's get ready then. Luchito, stay with me. We'll hold the boom. The others will wait outside for a while. Mmm... - Ready. - Ready? So, Chuli? - You know the lines? - Got it, got it. All right. I told you it wasn't that way! It wasn't that way. Honey, your dad got into a traffic jam over the bridge... Your mom is unbelievable! - Is everything ready for lunch? - Yes. No. Steven is shooting. All right. We were in a hurry. - Go put the groceries away. - What? - Put the groceries away. - I'll do it. No problem. - Really? - Yes. All right, honey. I'll get changed. - I'll be right back. - Don't worry. Go. No comments. I'll take a shower. Okay. Is the material ready? Calm down! Well... - The material's ready. - Okay. In fact, it's very good, Pao. Thank you. How was it? How was it? I was a machine. A stallion. A badass. A porn star. Good. I had finally found what I was good at. Far from my father's mediocrity... far from other people's expectations... far from constant stress... far from me not giving a damn. This is what I wanted for myself. This was it. Period. I want to be a porn actor. What, baby? I want to be a porn actor. I'll make some of our movies and then we'll see... what comes next. No, son. Imagine that. An actor? No, no, no. That's a very unstable job. Those poor people don't know when they'll get called. - It isn't that easy. - Right. It's not for everyone. If you want to have sex, there's many other things you can do. I already did a scene. Yesterday, I did a scene, and it was great. Right, Steven? Honestly, it was. What do you mean, "honestly, it was"? What do you mean? Paola. Paola! Did you know about this? Why do you confuse our son? No, Carlos Andres is very young. He must finish college and then decide what he wants to do next. It was just a scene. We had agreed on something else. Haven't I taught you about trust? Why did you keep it from us? Can I say something? For us to know. What about what I think? And you shouldn't have told him... It wasn't a question. It was a decision. And once your career is over... what's next? Mom just didn't want me to be an actor. She didn't care if I was a porn actor. But I had made up my mind. A porn star had been born. Now I needed something else. So? Your opinion? That's a good name. Right, Steven? I think it sounds good. Good, and in the end, it's punchy. And it sounds like a real actor. Where did you get that name from? - Why Renato Doca? - Donato, Donato Roca. Think about it. Think about it, Paola. Who would buy a movie called "Carlos Andres Sanabria and the Schoolgirls with no Underwear"? In that sense... yes, you're right. And well, an artist's name is his seal. It's vital. It's Donato Roca. Donato. It sounds Italian, it's an homage to Italian movies, but it also has Roca, which is... what the director will pay for. But that isn't... Wait a minute. What? Again? Donato Roca. Donato Roca. That name and the scene I had done turned me into a porn actor. I could now say that my family's business was also mine. Hi. Hey, did you find the contact info I asked for? The contact info? Yes, for my paper on degradation of sexual exposure... No. I didn't find it. Don't you think that "degradation" is a very strong word to describe...? Come on. It's about exposing your sexual intimacy to entertain an audience. That's clearly degradation. That's not even sex. It's a distortion of reality that changes a human due to impulses. - If you watched a movie that... - Shit. Erika talked too much. It's not that I didn't enjoy watching her blush, how she ran out of breath when she talked, how her tits looked when she gesticulated. But what she said... what she said was just too much information. More informed and you could change your perception. No? Should we go or...? Let's go. Ever since he was little, he was unstable. Remember? He liked soccer and then taekwondo and then swimming... What is Carlos Andres' problem now? Imagine, Father, he's decided he wants to be an actor. - Wants to be an actor? - Yes. Just imagine that. - That's great. - I don't think so. - That's a very respectable job. - It's very unstable, Father. - He was disoriented. - I just want the best for him. How good he's chosen a path. Martha, daughter, don't allow this to disturb your peace. Everyone must follow his own calling, either as a lawyer or an engineer. - Yes, Father. - I think that's great. - Really? - Yes. Maybe the fact of impersonating other people's lives allows Carlos Andres to cope with the situations he sees at home. What situations, Father? Your business situation. Oh, no. No, Father. That's not it. Carlos Andres wants to be one of our actors. The worst plan ever. A black-and-white movie in Polish. Half of it is a flashback. The other half is a dream, I think. I mean... 3 hours and 45 minutes of pure shit. I was sitting next to the girl I liked, but she was more interested in post-war Polish films than... than in me. That means femininity. It's a stronger term than the left. Good. But the right part is always kept. The pace picks up in the second half. - Really? - So I thought. - Yes, it's nice. - Should I close? No, let me. Okay... Hey, what is it that you do in movies? I'm the direction assistant. - Nice. - It is. - And you stare, obviously. - I don't. - You don't? - No. Come on. You do! No, no. I mean it. Of course. All men do. Yes. She was right in front of me. I was paralyzed. Scared as hell. That's when I thought: "Fuck it! I'm a porn star! If I want to, I'll fuck her right in front of her house!" I didn't have to say anything. I just had to show her who she was talking to. - Bye, see you in college. - Carlos! No. - Bye. - Bye, Carlos. - Take care. - Bye. A porn actor gets chosen for three reasons: because he's able to get it up in front of others, because he doesn't come before hearing: "Action!" And because he's able to finish it all once he's told to. Physical appearance matters. I won't deny it. But it's not fundamental. What are you doing there? Come here! Ready, Charlie? Get set. Take your underwear off. Sorry. Oh, baby... I couldn't tell by looking at you. Why are you laughing? Stop it! Just enjoy, Charlie. Stand up, baby. Show us your breasts. Now lean, so that... Charlie. Thrust her very slowly. Come here, Martha. Come here. Our son is working. Please, please don't destroy this business. I'm begging you. Paola, your brother is about to enter a very difficult world and he doesn't know. Will you allow him to? All right, let him decide if he likes it or not. He's old enough. He'll become an actor. Is that what you want for your brother? Silence. Josh is there. You didn't answer, Paola. Answer me, answer me. Instability is a problem. He doesn't have a permanent job, he works for pennies. I just want him to have a normal job. I know, I know. I get worried because I love him. I know! I know, but don't worry. Very good! It seems we have found our main character. I tried to talk to him, Father. To convince him, to show him there's a different way. I tried everything you said, but it didn't work. Father, what should I do? Tell me, what should I do? Show him the path of good, Martha, and think he'll follow it. Everyone lives life his way. Yes, right. So, I should wait until he makes a decision and then respect it? What you mentioned the other day about one's calling... called my attention. No, no, no, Martha. If you see that it isn't the right path, other options must be considered. So I didn't understand, Father, or I didn't know how to communicate that to him. Why don't you talk to him? - Me? - I know he won't come. But there's a dress rehearsal this afternoon. - Why don't you come home? - No, no. Yes! We won't tell him that you're coming. We'll take him by surprise. I can't, Martha. I don't belong there. Father, I'd thank you for that. No, Martha, I have many things to do at church. - What should I do, Father? - Just talk to him. I already talked to him, Father! - Didn't you hear me? - Yes, I heard you. What do you think a mother should do when she finds out that her son decided to be... a porn actor? What, Father? - A porn actor. - What, Father? A porn actor, Martha! Is this actually what you want to do, son? Well... I can't picture myself doing anything else. I think I'm doing great. I'm good at it. I know this may bother you. Is this your calling? I guess. I already taught you what I had to teach you. I already taught you what's good and what's not. You are an adult, Carlos Andres. You, you can fly on your own. And, son, if this is what you want to do... count on me. The next step with Erika was the unavoidable introduction to her family. Well, what does your family do? No, dad, no. Stop the interrogation. It's not an interrogation. An interrogation takes many days. The word "interrogation" means that you're interrogating him. They make videos. Videos? Videos? What kind? Institutional ones. Yes, they are... institutional. - For the... - For institutions then. Yes, like for companies. Right? It's a trend nowadays. Everybody is making... They're doing great. In fact, you should make a video for your company, dad! Of course! It would be great! It could work because... Well, but... those videos aren't for everyone. Things with Erika were going great. I loved seeing her talk... and talk... and talk... and talk. - And I think that's absurd. - Yes. Absurd. I could stare at her for hours. Anywhere, anytime. I felt complete when I was with her. If being in love was something like this... I was lost in love. Scene 5. Interior. Massage room. Day. Sofia is sleeping on a massage table. Jason is on the other, waiting for Solange to give him a massage. Solange comes in, action starts, and then Jason responds: Honey, I have some dick spasms. - What? - Dick spasms. The volume and the intention must be different, Carlos. - Honey, I have dick spasms. - Okay. Solange answers... Yes, I can tell you're tense. But my tongue can release all sorts of knots. Perfect. Action starts. Not a blow job yet. Sofia gets up slowly. She sees everything that's going on. Listen, in this dialogue you're upset, but in fact you just want to be invited. Sofia's turn. What the hell are you doing, Jason? Sofia, I have enough for both of you. You knew this was a sexual fantasy of mine. Stop staring and come closer then. Good. Action starts. Okay, then you stand up and then... No. Mmm... Being a porn actor means coping with excess. But not in my case. It wasn't just a game. Mom was an anthropologist. Dad didn't want me to study Anthropology, so I didn't think I'd end up studying Anthropology. I also wondered what other studies to pursue. Knowing what to choose is important, because it determines your future. Did Carlos tell you about the paper I must write? - No. - No, no. - No. - Yes. - Yes. - No. No, honey. I would remember. - In college she was asked to... - It doesn't matter. I have to interview for college... an actor. Or an actress... Porn? Yes, a porn actor. - Just ask Carlos. - Of course. Mom, dinner got cold. I can help you. If you want it warmer, I can heat it up. I can help you with Marlon. Marlon, Marlon. Nice. Who is he? What do you mean? Marlon. Carlos Andres, don't be like that. - Help her with the interview. - Yes, I told him so. - Who wants some dessert? - I want some dessert! - Want some? - Yes, I do! - I'll be right back. - I haven't finished yet. Just try it, baby. And she says it's custard dessert, but... I thought it was... It isn't a custard dessert, right? I thought it was something else. That's what she has told me since I was little. Wasn't it too much meeting my family? Hey, don't say that. - I really liked them. - Really? Yes, they're cool. I swear. Steven? - Well, he's... - He's so nice. Yes, yes. He's great. But he talks... Well, everyone talks about your business... as every family does. It's normal. - Sure? - Sure. Anyway... And just like that... I had a girlfriend. I mean, Carlos Andres Sanabria had a girlfriend. But Donato Roca didn't. Carlos Andres... - What? - It's your life. You decide what you want to do with it. Are you sure you want to have this job? Are you sure about your choice? I am. Why the lies then? Having a relationship in this field is tough. Lying makes it worse. Especially to that girl. No, listen. Things will break at some point. And you'll lose either your career... or your relationship. That night I knew... I was right. But three weeks later, Paola was right. Hi, baby. I've been calling you and you haven't answered. Do you want me to pick you up at 4? Let me know. I'll pick you up at your dad's or at your friends' place. Kiss. Carlos, I like seeing you in love. How long have you been together? - Three months. - Three months? Things look good, right? - Wanna continue? - Yes. So, the dialogue... Let's go this way. Wait, wait. Okay. My plumbing is clogged. Can you help me? I have the perfect tool. - What's your name? - Lina. Do you come to this gym often? I do. You're not doing it well. Stretch wider. That's it. But Alvaro didn't think I was cute. I didn't know we had more in common than expected. Oh, Donato! He obviously told the only person I didn't want to know about it. Motherfucker! Son of a bitch! Erika, wait! Let's talk! Erika! Don't make me chase you! Let me talk! Let's discuss it! I mean it! Wait! Let me explain, please! Wait, Erika! I swear I wanted to tell you! Really? Were you going to tell me? Were you going to say that you were screwing ten women while I was studying at home like a fool? - No, Erika. - Do you have sex with men too? Why are you acting like that? That's why I couldn't talk to you! Don't talk to me! I said don't talk to me! Don't talk to me! You disgust me! So I disgust you? Nice. Why didn't you tell me before? You should've told me when I took you home! Does my mom disgust you too? Does Paola disgust you? Does my sister disgust you? So everyone doing this disgusts you? So judgmental! What are you looking at? Life turned to shit. My life stopped for two weeks. I didn't get up. I hated being alive. But most of all... I hated I wasn't alive for her anymore. Then one night I realized... I couldn't go on without her. Erika, open up, please! Let's talk! Erika, you haven't answered, I haven't seen you! I won't leave until you open the door, Erika! Erika, you just can't stop talking to me! It meant something to you too! At least come out and tell me that it meant something! It meant something to me. Go to hell. Erika! You fell in love with me, not with my job! That was just a job! You talked to me first. What could I do? I've always liked you... ever since I saw you. Before I got into... If you ask me to, I'll quit. I'll leave it all behind. But please... don't go. Carlos Andres... you make porn. You slept with many bitches and then you kissed me. - You told me things... - No, no. It wasn't like that, it was just a job. And... my job has nothing to do with my personal life. Besides, I can't picture myself doing that. You weren't fair to me. What you did was wrong. I know, I know I wasn't fair to you. But I want to be fair now and... be fair with you most of all. Really. No, Eri, Eri, please... Please don't go. You can't imagine how miserable I've been... since you left. I haven't been able to work. I don't... I can't, I just can't. I can't. Really? Why not? Because you changed my life, Eri. I can't imagine life without you. I'm not me anymore... if I'm not with you. And your dad... I didn't want him to be the one who told you. Why isn't he here, trying to kill me? He's not home. He'll be away for a while. Eri... I had never felt like this. I mean it. Never. Do you promise... you'll leave it all behind? I promise. Will you take that ring off too? Also? That's why I won't give you any, that's why you won't get any. Give him some so he moves his hips. I don't want to see you all drunk. - So he moves his hips... - Look, there he is! Hey, hey! We were waiting for you, you've finally shown up. Come here. Who's the best brother? Who's here? Come here. Who's here? Our baby. Drink it up. Drink it. We've been celebrating after getting some news. - Drink it up. - What? - Just drink it! - What, Steven? Crazy boy... Josh... wants us to coproduce... with Jessica Palmers and Bianca Siemens. Guess, pretty boy... who they want as our lead? They think you're the Latin Nick Heart. Half of it will be shot here and the other half... guess where. In Miami, in Miami! Man, this is a sexual fantasy for those of us who make porn! After this... we'll get to all... all of the American market. DVDs, web series... They're even talking about having our own channel! Come here, you know what's next? You know what's next for you? You do, you do? Are you happy? And also the yacht. What you mentioned. Yes, an apartment too. What you mentioned about New York is great, because... It's just that I... I was thinking I... I won't make porn anymore. What do you mean, Charlie? What are you talking about? It's just that I won't make porn anymore, Steven. In Colombia? No... in general. Charlie... are you aware of what you're saying? You're telling us to send to hell everything we've been doing. Will you send it to hell? Talk to him, tell him something. You know him. What's happening, Charlie? - Man! - Enough, enough. Do you need some time? In that case, we can talk to the producer. They might give us some time... - No, no, this isn't about time. - Easily, I mean... I won't make porn anymore, not now, not never, it's... What an asshole... Unbelievable. When things started to work out... you had to fuck things up. Listen, Charlie. I know actors sometimes... are balky, dual... I don't know. Is that it? Is this about money, man? If this is about money, just tell us. - Tell us. - No. - Just ask for it! - Whatever you want. Ask for money and we'll give it to you right away! - This isn't about money. - What is it then? It's just that... sometimes you have to choose between your career and the people you love... I'm not saying that I don't love you. What are you talking about? What are you saying? What are you talking about? You must make that fucking movie, no matter what! No, Paola! No. He won't make any movie if he doesn't want to. Come here, son. Come on. Calm down. Tell me. Are you sure about what you're saying? I am. All right. So... the movie won't be made. Just thank Mr. Josh but he won't do it. - How do you... how...? - Enough, Paola! You've said it yourself, no drama. The movie won't be made, topic closed. All right, Mrs. Martha. Let's just send everything to fucking hell. You don't have to be rude, Steven. Sorry. - Steven... - Shut up. Thanks, Mom. Thanks. You screwed up. You fucked it up, moron! Stop it, Paola. Don't tell him anything, just go upstairs! Don't worry. Indeed... everything was fucked up... so badly, that I couldn't live at home anymore. May the Virgin and God protect you. Okay, all right. And my happy days began. Just tell me how I can help. After apologizing to Erika's dad... - Okay. - We started to live together. A new life far from excess... a new life where Alvaro helped me to find a job to provide for Erika while she finished her studies... Half an hour for lunch... from Monday to Sunday. And the breaks... Of course, he got me a job... Show me your hands. With the worst boss he could find. You have experience as a pizza maker? Sort of. Break it. It was strange... but sublime too. Stefano was on it... Who was he with? A man and a gorgeous girl. Tears rolled down his cheeks. Tears? Stefano cried? Man! Unbelievable, he's too sensitive. He became like that after his mom's death. Obviously. Hey... how are things with Erika? Good. At least I don't cry like Stefano. I mean... honestly. Fine, we're happy. We've been living together for five months. We opened our new microwave, that was like Christmas for us. She complains about the bathroom. The usual women stuff. - Your sister is just like that. - I guess. Listen, Charlie, don't you miss your old life? My old life? Come on, man! Just tell me the truth, you just miss seeing me naked. - Right? - Right. Donato, keep it in, Donato! No, man. I miss that too... the feeling that I'm good at something. Needless to say, you're not good at it. You're great, Charlie. - I'm not kidding. - The pace, the adrenaline... Honestly, but I wouldn't change what I have now... for my old life. Honestly, she makes it all worth it. I'm much happier now than before. That's a fact. Honey! What is it? The worst day ever? In the worst pizza place ever? But... I can make it... a good day. Really? What do you say? She did. She made my day better. And my life. And everything. It sounds stupid, but love had changed me. Not even after a million scenes... I had never felt like this. It wasn't just a great fuck. This was different. She made me feel different. Porn didn't give me that feeling. In fact, I couldn't even compare it. They were two different experiences. Sex with love is something else. That was precisely the end of Donato Roca's story. I would've done it... if dad hadn't screwed up. To cover the hole he had made, the producer asked Esteban Mahecha for a 180 million pesos loan. He was Bogota's main drug traffic leader. A very... very bad idea. I'll pay. I'll pay back! On top of it, instead of investing in the company, he decided to gamble, he wanted to double the profits. He was sure he would win. But owing some motherfucker you know is one thing. A very different one is owing a guy like Esteban Mahecha. It was all a bad... terrible idea. No, no. What are you saying? Obviously not. - How can you ask that of me? - It's our only choice! Think about a real choice! Come on! - What are you thinking? - No way. Charlie, our situation is terrible. The financial statements showed something... but the reality was different. The reality is that dad managed our business terribly. It's that simple. Damn it, we found out we owe a lot of money to the bank. We have no credit. We have nowhere to get that money from. This is the situation. Josh called us two months ago, he asked about you. We told him you didn't make porn anymore. They insisted. Turns out that the DVDs we made with you were reprinted. You became an Internet phenomenon. You're famous and even trendy. I know, but it's true! You're an urban myth. There are other actors, Charlie. There are. Some of them are even better. But turns out... What? People want you. We did the numbers, we'd get 161 million. We'll have to find the rest, but it doesn't matter. Carlos Andres... it's only a six-minute scene. You're our only choice. Either that... or dad will get killed. That's it. I... I can't do that and... I don't know how to tell... Erika... It's about your dad. Mom... What do you want me to do? - You want me to stay home...? - What can I do, Erika? While you fuck those other women? Dad will get killed! It's just one scene. I told them... we had to talk about it. Of course, I had to discuss it with you. You know, you know... You understand that body and soul are two different things, right? You do? You get that, right? You... Well, it's not a question. It's a decision. The scene is as follows. You're with the teacher... you're the only one who hasn't returned the test... she approaches you... she says something that leads to foreplay and then the action starts. - Who's the actress? - Amanda. Amanda. We can look for another option, but... No, she's fine, she's fine. Charlie, see you on set when you're ready. Let me know. I'll direct the scene. Are you up to it? Yes, I need to do it. Let's go. I'm here... Sound! Done. It was all ready. But when something is doomed to fail... it does. Precisely that day, I couldn't get it up. - Ready? - Rolling. And... Honey, I don't want to pressure you, but... we could shoot the scene before the penetration... and we'll see how things go. - You think? - Yes. Got it, okay. So guys... we're going to change a bit the dynamics of the scene. Carlos Andres. Then you say your lines and action starts after. - Got it? - Okay. Got it? - Ready? - Got it. Fine, let's do this. - Ready guys on set? - Silence! - Sound! - Rolling. Camera rolling! Scene one, take one. Concentrated... horny... and... action! Donato Roca. So you failed your test again. If I don't pass this test, I'll lose my chance in the soccer team. Really? If you want to play, you'll have to show me your potential. I'm thinking about a good way to do it. Right there, your hand. Look, grab the teacher's ass, it's gorgeous. That's it, that way. Move your hand up, suspenders off. Her shirt button. That's hot. Perfect... Perfect. Put the teacher's leg up. Good, there we are. Go for it, kiss, kiss, kiss all the way up. Up, find her tits... That's it. Kiss her... and get there. Carlos! Cut, cut! Come on, calm down. - Calm down. - Don't worry. - Are you okay? - Yes, yes. What's wrong, Donato? What's happening? This is unusual. What about these people, why are they looking at us? I don't understand why they're on set all the time... looking at me... they're making me nervous. There's too many people on the set! Okay. Celeste, wear your uniform and we'll do the male teacher-female student scene. Say hi at least. We couldn't shoot today. Why? Some production problems. The camera wasn't working well. We'll see if it works tomorrow. Do you want to order something or...? I'll take a shower. What do you want? A pill, cocaine? Tell me what you need and I'll get it. I'll get it up. Don't worry... I'll get it up. We don't know how or where dad is. If you go out there, forget about Erika for 30 minutes and fuck Amanda. Otherwise, we won't see dad alive again. Understood? Other actors are waiting outside. I'll make other scenes in the meantime. Amanda will be waiting for you whenever you want and whenever you can do the scene. We have two days to shoot, Carlos Andres. Without you, they'll pay me 12,000 dollars. 12,000. So you're in trouble, Paola! This might sound stupid, but without love, without that feeling, I can't do that scene. I don't give a damn! You must have thought about it before getting into this business. I told you many times. This isn't about feelings or love. It's a matter of biology and horniness. If anyone chose to make porn, anyone could do it. I'll wait for you outside. - Is Carlos in? - Yes, come in. Thanks. Hi. You know if Carlos Andres has... finished, is he resting? Carlos Andres won't do the scene. Why? Let's just say that... he fell in love. That's why he won't do the scene. We haven't completed all the money, so... dad isn't coming back. - Want me to talk to him? - No. - I can talk to him. - Erika, don't. He'll listen to me. I'm the only person he listens to. I'll talk to him for five minutes... Erika, there's no need to confuse him anymore. Seriously. I don't know... I don't know what the solution may be. But something is clear, your presence doesn't help. This... will be solved as a family. I'm just trying to help, you know? Just don't. Carlos... Carlos. I just wanted to tell you... that I know you don't want to do it. But now I know you have to. You left so much behind... you made a lot of money with this job. You even took your ring off. You... you'd leave it all. You would... even let your dad... You'd do anything for me. Anything... anything. Look at me. Look at me, it's okay, look at me. I'd do anything for you. Anything. Erika helped me to do what I couldn't have done myself. Donato Roca. So you failed your test again. If I don't pass this test, I'll lose my chance in the soccer team. Porn wasn't about porn stars anymore. It was about us. If you want to play, you'll have to show me your potential. I'm thinking about a good way to do it. Erika agreed to make this scene with me. The contract only required me in the scene, so the producers agreed. It was unique. Magical. It meant doing something I had done many times before, but it felt different. It was probably the least erotic scene ever. Kids. It's good, I'm fascinated. - But... - It needs more rhythm. It's too romantic, I need you to be horny. You must demonstrate you like it when it comes in and out. Otherwise... it won't work. At least until... Okay, so we need more action. - Very well. - Look at her. That's it! - There you go. - Go. Look at me! What are you looking at? Okay, we have some rhythm. Can you thrust her faster? Look at me. Get it in, get it in. There we go. Open your mouth a bit, princess. Grab her hair. Show me her face. This is so hot! Perfect! Good. Thank you. Seriously. All right. I love you. And I love you. Donato. It's nice to be able to count on you, Charlie. Oh, God. Donato, I talked to Josh. They want you to be... their exclusive talent. You know what that means? I'd say about... 70,000 dollars a year! They want you. You're the best. No, Steven. I won't make porn anymore. I told Erika it was my last scene. Thanks... Thanks. Porn was over for me. I could finally be with Erika. On my own terms, with our new life. Hi. I was offered to make some movies... and start with short scenes. Very, very short scenes. Not something big. Not... But there's a chance... it might become something bigger. Don't give me that look. Josh was telling me there is a trend called "girl next door." It's about the typical girl, I mean, anyone can be a porn actress. They're not looking for voluptuous, perfect women anymore. They're looking for real people... for women who feel empowered about their bodies... who feel at ease with their femininity. They're clearly looking for reality. For people... like you... or like me. Don't give me that look. Come on. Don't make that face. Look at me. It is said that love can take it all. But a partner who was a porn actress... was too much for me. Oh, Donato! You can't love anyone while making porn. And cut! Okay, guys. - So we got it? - Got it. - Everything okay? - Everything okay. We'll make a scene on Saturday, right? - No, next week. - Next week? No, I told you I was available until 4. Luckily, porn ends when the director says "Cut." - I thought you wouldn't come. - Yes. And our lives continue then. It's beautiful. Hi, honey! Hi! Go with dad. Did you see all the decorations? It was all for you. The lights, the balloons... the balloons over there... Grandpa is right there. I thought you wouldn't make it. You look beautiful. Maybe many people wouldn't like to have a wife who makes porn. They might say many things. But I have something to say to those people... I'm happy with the woman I love. In the end, we are like any other family. A family composed of Donato Roca and Jessie Horny. But a family in the end. Erika?
