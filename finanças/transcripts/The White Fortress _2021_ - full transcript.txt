THE WHITE FORTRESS What time is it? It's 7am. Have you been to Hawaii? Every summer. Right. Bye. See you later. Try to be quiet on your way out. Morning uncle. Was it the alarm again? Something like that. I had that dream again. It started with a party. Your mother and her orchestra were there. The guests were hungry. I was in charge of the barbecue, and when I looked at the grill, I saw my own body parts. My hands, my legs, my intestines. That's bizarre. Your mom just kept playing her piano. You know what awoke me? Realizing that I liked human flesh. And I couldn't get enough of it. I wonder what that means. What? I wonder what it means. I thought you might know. No clue. You were born clueless. Don't mix aluminum and iron. - What? - Don't mix aluminum and iron. Hi grandma! What took you so long? Something always comes up. Could you pass the glasses? And a little water. Uncle Mirsad said he'll stop by. To hell with him. He always says he'll visit. Tell him I don't plan to take the apartment to my grave. Pay the bills tomorrow. So the pension's arrived? Vucko! Vucko! Good day Ms. Luca. Good day. - Election Announcement - Where are your flip flops? Good one Vreco, good one. What took you so long? - You're becoming unreliable. - Says who? You're always late. Here's the address. What letter is this? That's an... N. No, that one's an M. Who am I driving? You don't need to know. I told Cedo that you're serious and motivated. Don't mess this up! Don't worry. I'm serious. And don't be late! You have any more work for me? Maybe tomorrow, Vreco. Here's a little something. Some generosity. The tip goes in the register. Whatever boss. Who is it? Roasted sesame. Give me a minute. Ok. Are you Minela? Where's your car? What car? They said I'd get a driver. - Alright, and? - A driver with a car. Ok, take the tram then. Are you deaf or dumb? I'm serious, take the tram. A tram? Who are you calling? - You know who I'm calling. - Wait, now. - Calm down. - Don't touch me. - Put the phone away, I'll figure it out. - I'll give you 5 seconds. Alright, give me a sec. Hello. Can you send a cab to 83 Sefta Hodzic. It wouldn't kill you to help out. Damn this little car. At least it's not a scooter. See you around. Drive, please. - Where to? - It doesn't matter, just drive. Thanks. - Watch where you're going. - I'm sorry! I'm Faruk. What's your name? Ok, don't tell me your name. But you could make it up to me by taking me out for coffee. I don't drink coffee. Tea, juice, or... How about I give you my number, then? 060323994 Quick quick, write it down: 060323 - There. What school you at? I'm not in school. A dropout? That's right. - Then... - My friends are waiting for me. Bye then, Girl Who Doesn't Drink Coffee I'm Mona. Hello! I'm fine. You? Why're you asking? I can't tomorrow, I have a test. I'll see you at grandma's. What sort of photoshoot? Where? Fine. Alright! Bye! Motherfuckers, how did... Those motherfuckers. I scared them away! So you did? You want a medal or something? What nerve "I scared them off" idiot. Hey! Where are you? I'm fine. Could you pick me up at the Annex. You getting any tail? Always! Did the doctor visit mom? Not yet. Are the new pills helping? A little. You guys need anything? Maybe, I could I borrow your truck? I need to drop of the scooter for repairs. I'll think about it. I'll think about it. You naive fuck. You think it was smart to take a taxi with Minela? Tell me. You can't show weakness, or they'll eat you alive. So why'd you send me? You said you want to prove yourself. Seriously, why send me? You go find a girl. Charm her, do your thing, just convince her to work for Cedo. What now? It's nothing. Ok, see you around then. See you. See you. Germany Eat! Eat! Eat! Eat! Eat! Eat! Eat! Eat! Eat! How's everything? Damn junkies keep bringing useless scrap. It's not easy for them. Street drugs got more expensive. I owe you, 169. It's worth at least 200. The scale doesn't lie. You owe me one mark. I don't have any change. You'll have it next time. Take care! See you next time! Have a good day! Here is 50. Don't spend it right away. Recently I read some verses from a Bosnian poet: "May the powerful help the persecuted, as the persecutor." The persecuted? I'm not so sure. I'd rather be the persecutor. Way of habit, Bischoff. How long have you been looking for Walter? One year. More than a year, Colonel. And what have you learned? Nothing. Maybe he's just a ghost. I wonder if he even exists. I don't believe in ghosts, Bischoff. Walter does exist, and he's there. Somewhere in Sarajevo. Do you remember me? Mona, the girl who hates coffee? You change your mind? Thank you, Amela, that was wonderful. Is anyone having any issues with their assignment? Yes? No? No questions? About coffee? No. Juice? Okay. What do I mean when I say personal growth? Yes, Sanel? Alright. When? Tomorrow evening, 8? What else? Maybe having a code. That works! What do you mean by that? A system you buy into. A set of values. But how does one form a set of values? - Through experience, environment... - Good. - Habits perhaps... - Very good. Forming beneficial habits. - Did you watch last night's episode? - I did, did you? That Begum gets on my nerves. Why Begum, she's my favourite. She's dumb. So indecisive. Kerim is a fine man, while she chases that whoring crook Pasa. Pasa would sell her for a kilo of flour. No one would watch these shows, if they had happy endings. No, let me. I have to stretch my legs. All I know is that it won't end well. What is it? Did you fall in love? I need to score a few hundred. I told you how you can get paid. Vreco! What did we say about those shorts? If they bother you so much, buy me new ones. Shaquille O'Neil shoots! Watch your heads. Yao Ming style! I'm Yao Ming. - Do you want to make some money? - Can I play now? I said I do. Then go change those shorts. What's with you and my shorts. - Be back in twenty minutes. - Put on a warmer top, too. Faruk if you mess this up... Both Vreco and I will fuck you u... You know the rest! You'll be the lookout. Honk if someone approaches. Don't worry. Where's Mirsad? He sent us. He sent you? He did. 207 marks. That little? I pay by the kilo. Most of the metal you brought is hollow. That scaffolding is in good shape, if you didn't sell it as scrap, you'd earn more. Are you interested? Where did you find it? Almir's uncle was throwing them out. 207 marks. My offer is final. Take care! Almir, turn on the engine. Hey! Hello. Have you ordered? Not yet. Good evening, ready to order? I'll have, peach juice. A long espresso. Didn't we say no coffee? You want me to fall asleep? You're already bored? I'm not. I didn't expect you to message. I didn't either. What grade did you say you were in? Grade ten? - Eleven? - No. Grade nine? Maybe. Here you go. Thank you. What about you? You still live with your folks? No. With whom? My grandma. What's your story? My parents want me gone. They want to send me to Toronto. To Canada? You must've really messed up. Why do they want you gone? I have a feeling that their marriage is just a work arrangement. Why is that a problem? I don't think they were ever in love. And that bothers you? It does. Love is a luxury. You're such a romantic. I'm serious. What use does one have for love? I guess a feeling, a feeling of belonging. And when that feeling goes away? You keep looking. You're so young. And you're a dinosaur. Where are the others? I'll be there in an hour. I'll be there in an hour, I said! This country deserves real change. And we cannot let old quarrels get in the way of our progress. Filthy thief! Hi, are you alright? I'm fine. Did you see? Yeah, it's gone viral. I'm fine and don't worry. I'll see you later. If you say so. See you at grandma's. Vucko! Vucko! What's wrong? Cedo wants to meet. Both of us? Have you seen Vucko? - To hell with Vucko. - I saw him last night. No one's seen him all day. He's just wandering around, don't worry. He never misses breakfast. - Stop whining! - He'll be back. Why are you staring at me like that? 'Cause you're cute. Vermin! Damn parasites! They've attacked bananas. Did you know that bananas are endangered? I didn't know. He looks like he might. No, I didn't know. So why are you nodding then? Do you like bananas? I do. - We do. - We do. You won't be eating them much longer. So, Faruk... Why did I ask to see you? I shouldn't have taken a taxi with Minela. That's right. Have you heard the story about little Vedad? - Yes. - What have you heard? That he was eaten by dogs. Why? Because he was a thief. Stole from? He stole from you. So Almir, why do you think you're both here? We would have never stolen the scaffolding, had we known the construction site was yours. - It was my fault, I talked him into it. - We can buy new scaffolding. His uncle has a van, we can get you new ones today... That's right, my uncle has a truck. Why are you whining like pussies? Are you pussies? - We're not. - We're not pussies. If you two... do anything like this behind my back... What'll happen? Dogs! What do dogs sound like? - They bark. - They say 'aw aw'? I'll give you one more chance. I have a job for you. What will happen with her? She'll get better and we'll take her home. In a day or two. She'll be like new. They showed us the bridge. And the caves. No, I haven't. That's not why mom... We were singing, and... I lost my voice. I will, mom. I will. I'm eating every day. We gotta go. Mom, that's our tour guide... I have to go, I'll call you tomorrow. I will. After yesterday's party congress, members of UPD have decided to go forward with their lawsuit against former members of their party. Edo, please turn it off. Alen Babic has been accused of stealing while serving as city councilor. So tell me... Are they fighting again? What do you care? We're here to celebrate! What took so long? The Canadians! Little brother! You think one of your old colleagues was behind it? Maybe Ismar? That's not Ismar's style. I don't know how you can put up with this. It's really good. Thanks, grandma. Who didn't get a piece? It's delicious. That's good, that's good. He can eat alright. I made this for you. - It's with your favourite jam. - For special occasions. Mona, what's the first food you want to try in Canada? I like the food here just fine. It's cold there. Why couldn't you move to like Florida or California? Adi! Tell her something nice about Toronto. What do you want to study? What will you study? Video game design. Is there any money in that? It is the biggest entertainment industry. Have you ever hear of Minecraft, Overwatch... - Fortnite. - What's he talking about? I have no idea how you plan to design them if all you do is play them. He has to play them if he's to design them. Leave him alone, and play the music. The dawn is breaking The day is upon us But I must leave The dawn is breaking The day is upon us But I must leave I'm not sad because I'm leaving, I'm sad because I left my Playstation behind. Play on, my friends The song of my sorrows I'll take out three pistols And shoot out the window I'll take out my three pistols And shoot through the windows And the rest goes like this... I'm no gunslinger dearest one, Just a politician Hoping to win another election I'm no gunslinger dearest one, It's all about the election - Cheers to that - Cheers What is it? We've been thinking... We think you should go to Toronto this summer. You serious? We'd visit right after the election. You said it'd be next year... Look here! Do you know how hard I work to make this possible? Please, let us hear it again! You don't have to agree, but show us some respect. Fuck off! - Excuse me? - How dare you! Why are you defending him? You don't even know where he sleeps! - Are you done? - Enough! You have no say in the matter. What was that? He ran over someone. How did she not hear us? Alen, should we call someone? I don't know. I'll sleep at grandma's. - Mona! - Let her be. She cannot behave like this. Let it go. I've had enough drama. We're leaving. You coming? MONA: What are you up to? FARUK: Late shift, you? MONA: Watching soaps with grandma. FARUK: Are we still on for Wednesday? - My Big Book of Fairy Tales - Are you hungry? MONA: What are you up to? FARUK: Late shift, you? Let's go! I heard that you once trained. You keep fouling. And your shoelaces are untied. The ball looks deflated. Vreco, go get it pumped. Come with me. What is it? You find a girl? Cedo forgave you. It's only fair you do something for him. How's Minela? Minela's fine. I asked you something. You find any girls? That work isn't for me. Isn't for you? So you'll keep collecting scrap metal? - That's right. - With your uncle? Yes. Ok then. Then be a wuss! - Vreco! - Get lost! - Want to make some money? - I do. Let's go then. Take care fucker! Vreco! I don't remember my dad. My mom played the piano in the Sarajevo Philharmonic Orchestra. Really? She died when I was little. I'm sorry. What do your parents do? Bureaucrats! Politicians? Not exactly. Then what? A little bit of everything. What does that mean? Is it some big secret? Which political party? I'm not sure anymore. Do you have any siblings? No, but I always wanted an older sister. She'd blackmail you! I'd have enough information to ensure mutual destruction. I always wanted a younger brother. Why younger? What use would I have for an older one? A younger one, So I could teach him how to ride a motorcycle, or how to pick up girls. What's so funny? I don't know. This feels weird... like we're... characters in some fairy tale. It's more like the beginning of a horror film. Look to your right. Take a puff. Is it any good? - Let me see. - No. - Come on! - No, you can't see it. What is it? I spoke with Branko. What'd he say. The police came round. How come? He said Almir and you brought in scaffolding. We found it in Almir's uncle's basement. Listen. If we weren't in mourning, I'd beat you right now. - I swear. - Cut the crap! I lend you the truck and this is what you do?! Tomorrow you better put up that listing. Is that clear? - For the apartment? - What else, you fucker! Don't worry, you'll get your half. Hey kid. She doesn't live here anymore. Be careful. Mona, please look at the lens. Is this one of your secret spots? Something like that. I could live here. I'd keep ten wild dogs and you! And what would you eat? I'd send you all to hunt. You'd die from contaminated water. I'm not a fool, I'd boil it. How? In a small pot? I'd make a fire. How would you make a fire? I'd bring some lighters. And when those lighters run out? I'd figure it out. Rock against rock? Let's run away. Where? Like in the movies. Really, what movie would that be. The one in which a girl is angry at the world, but then she meets a boy. They are happy at first, but in the end they both die. That sounds like a soap opera. Grandma would've adored you. I'm sorry. Do you know how butterflies kiss? How? Like this. Get up! I have a message from Cedo. What happened to Minela? She overdosed. And you just watched? Are you gonna be a problem? Stay away from Mona. - Find someone else. - What is it to you? - I'm telling you this for your safety. - My safety? You dumbass! I send you to find a girl to work for us, and you fall in love. You're a goner. The German Command calls on the citizens of Sarajevo parents or next of kin to take the bodies of their dead. I repeat: The German Command calls on the citizens of Sarajevo parents or next of kin to take the bodies of their dead. MONA: We still meeting? Are you ok? Yeah. You go ahead. - Need help? - No, I'm good. I can't remember the last time I was here. Me neither. Who will you live with in Canada? My uncle and aunt. What do you think this valley looked like, when they built this fortress? The Miljacka River probably didn't stink. I'm not so sure about that one. The valley was full of cows and sheep. And little wooden cabins and horses. Many armies marched through this valley, passing through the morning mist. What if someone's watching? Who? There's no one around. What about from below? From below, perhaps. You really think someone is watching, just waiting for something to happen? It's possible. Faruk! Faruk! As some of you know, this is my last term here and for my final assignment, I wrote a story. Once there was a golden valley and when moon and stars were aligned just right an enchanted fortress would appear. The locals believed that if one found true love, the fortress would show itself and let them travel to another time. One day, a boy appeared. No one knew where he came from. As the boy grew, he began to dream about the fortress. He visited all the towns and cities in the golden valley, hoping to find true love. Just as he lost all hope, he met a girl with whom he had many things in common, even though her upbringing was very different. Feeling a connection she wandered the valley with him, and places she usually avoided. Sadly, however, she was promised to another. The girl also dreamed of a fortress, and of fleeing her parents and their plans. Before the girl's wedding her parents organized a large celebration. That night, the clouds gave way to the stars and the enchanted fortress appeared above the city. Arriving at the fortress, she found the boy waiting for her. Together they sat and waited, but all the waiting made them very sleepy. The next morning when she awoke the boy and the fortress were gone. Heartbroken, when she asked the locals about the boy, no one remembered him. Feeling she would die soon, the girl now an old woman, returned to the valley to wait for the fortress and the boy to reappear. Mona! You'll be late for your flight! THE WHITE FORTRESS
