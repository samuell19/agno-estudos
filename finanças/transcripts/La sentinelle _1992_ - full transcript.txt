French Embassy - Bonn, Germany September, 1991 lt was the spring of 1943, the preparations for Yalta. Churchill arrives in Moscow in a small plane, unknown to Roosevelt. He stays in a house in Moscow, with Eden. The next day, he meets with Stalin, Molotov and Eden. THE SENTlNEL Churchill says: Let's not argue about things that aren't worth our time! l quote: 'Things that aren't worth our time.' He takes half a sheet of paper. This is true! He writes down his proposal: Rumania, 90% for you, 10 % for us; Greece, 90% for us, 10 % for you; Bulgaria, 75% for you, 25% for us; Yugoslavia, 50 - 50, then Hungary and Poland... He hands the paper to Stalin, who looks, and understands. Stalin takes out a pencil, a carpenter's pencil, and makes a blue mark of approval across the paper. Churchill says, 'Destroy that paper... 'or people will say we cynically decided the fate of millions.' Stalin laughs, takes the paper, folds it... and puts it in Churchill's pocket. Thus was the world made. That's all over, now. Yes... The Resistance, the camps... lt's as if we dreamed it all. Are you cold? Don't worry so... - Happy? - I think so. Tell your sister to call me... Call collect... Mother, we have to go. You have 5 minutes. Jean-Jacques is waiting. Can't miss the train. We're leaving. Amen. l stayed 3 days... Bonn, Aachen... After 3 days, l've had it! Shit! And it's cold! You there long? 25 years. Born there! What'd you do? l don't know... l worked... When I was a kid, my father was posted to London. That was great. Then here for 5 years, and back to Paris. 5 years, can you imagine! Sleepy? Am I bugging you? Tell me if I am... No, not at all... lt's too early to sleep. l'm afraid of not sleeping. Do you take pills? l don't like doctors... Not you, but doctors say, 'exercise.' lt's not lack of exercise, it's that l'm a pain in the ass. l bore people... lt's a problem when you're a diplomat. What people? People. Don't you bore people? ln Aachen, I guess there's nobody to bore... Paris is different... See? l'm a pain... And you're too young to be humoring me... French Customs. Your papers... Just a minute. What is it? Your passport isn't validated. Your papers aren't in order. There's no visa. l don't need a visa... ldentity card? What's the problem? He's French, he's going to France! He's a foreign resident. So? He doesn't need a visa! Come with us... l'm with the Foreign Ministry, OK? Strategic Affairs, that good enough? His father was military attach?! lt's OK. I think it's... Mathias! OK... Follow me. You open his bag. Should I come too? No, it's OK. Your nose is bleeding. We'll clean that up. Barillet? the ghost Excuse me while I clean up a bit. Mathias Barillet... l looked through your things... - That bother you? - No. So why are you here, why do I have your trunks? l don't know. You don't know? You must have an idea... You're looking... for something. Drugs? Secret documents? Military secrets? You, with secret documents? Sit down. You think you're a master spy? There's nothing in your baggage! Empty! A desert! No need to check. Mathias Barillet. Student of forensic medicine, right? You take care of the dead. Good, someone has to. Tell me something. Why aren't you a diplomat, like your father? Or like that clown you're traveling with? Not interested in diplomacy? Don't like it? You interest me. What do you want? To know who you are. You have friends? No, you have no friends. You're all alone. Useless. A zero. No friends, no enemies. You can't have friends if you do nothing for them. Want to help me? l don't know what this is about. You've the wrong person. Look at me! To me, you're guilty, because you're a whore. You're clean, now, with just a spot of shit inside. The more you grow, the more the whore in you will take over. Till that's all there is, eating at your life! And l'll be there, too! You're so proud to be innocent, but if there'd been anything in your bags, you'd already be in that fucking cage! l hope you have no friends! For your sake! Look at your fucking life! Socks and underpants! Christ, it's pathetic! Pick that up! You ashamed? Don't like me messing with your things... Think it's unfair? The world is unfair! Didn't you learn that in school? Why'd you bring me here? You knew I had nothing... Just to see you. lt's nice to talk, isn't it? l'm like you, l don't have any friends. l bend you over and use you. You're an object to me. Now pick that up and get out! Give me a cigarette... What did they want? Nothing. ldentity check... Drugs... I don't know... They harass you? l'm OK. lt's over... l'm dead tired. How about you? l'm OK. lt's big, eh? lt's -- lt's Paris. ls everybody here in forensic medicine? No, it's all the specialties. You're in public health? Yes. Over there... l should transfer in as an intern... So you say, but this is in German... lt's from the university. But it's in German. Obviously... Forget it. l'll ask at the lnstitute... - You're the new intern? - Yes. Come on. You're in toxicology... Me too. Here's the biology lab... Pathology... Autopsies downstairs... Toxicology is upstairs. l worked 12 years in toxicology. lt's really fundamental. This is like a photo. At a certain time, everything stopped... or almost. lt's a piece of time. Gastric liquids... The different stages of intestinal passage... Dating. Have you had that? Yes, last year in the lab at Aix la Chapelle. That for me? A suicide, I think... She arrived yesterday... 327... ln her 50's... OK? Not too disgusting? You get used to it. The exit... Enjoy the tour? Fine. Sorry, I have a nosebleed. Where are you? l have to get dressed and l'll be there. See you later... A customs officer? ln uniform? No, a civilian. An older man... Not one of ours... Fill in your address. l don't have an address yet. Your department is in charge of checking passports... You must know who it was? There are 8 security services on the trains. Who was the man in charge of the border check? We have no way of finding him! lf I give you some money... l can't tell you anything about another department. My little Mathias... - How are you? - Fine. Welcome... Welcome. Recognize me? Of course... You're sure? Yes, l'm sure... How is mom? She's fine... Christ, kiss each other! Make an effort... We're applying for... the Moscow Festival. lf we're selected... lt's a competition. lt'll be OK. He's the director, Peter... you know him? We both sing... We're doing a Delibes duet, l'm mezzo, Marie is soprano. lmpressed? lf it works... l'll be a singer! Me, too. A professional singer. You know the people that decide? The cultural office at... Foreign Affairs. Philippe de Varins is helping us... So you have a good chance? Knock on wood. How's my little colonel? OK. To success, to our artists! Philippe... Peter... Things are just warming up. That's Varins. He's helping the girls... l know him. When I was little... Go say hi! l don't want to bother him... l was only 7 or 8. He won't remember. l yell 'Strategic Affairs', l show my diplomatic l.D. Mathias stands up... Clack! Two machine guns are on us. 4 cops, right Mathias? l thought, they're going to shoot me like a dog. He goes white! lt wasn't that bad... You were white as a sheet. You've told it a hundred times... They haven't heard it. For once l'm a hero, shit! He bother you, with his story? What happened? lt was a border check... Why didn't they check Jean-Jacques? Maybe because dad was a diplomat, so theyjust wanted to check... His father is a diplomat, too. l know... Anyway, it's over now, and you're in Paris... We can spend some time together, you can come over... - You angry with me? - No! l haven't been home for so long, you hate me. lt's these people... We know them all from Berlin, and Bonn... lt's horrible... No, we've all stayed in touch while you were in Germany. You need to have some fun. And you need clothes! l'll get you some. Look at you. Dirty as a little kid. You're handsome. When I saw you come in... You've changed, you're a man! lt's strange... - Have I changed? - No. Your turn, William! l can't sing. Then dance! l can't dance, l can't do anything. Shall I strip? Shall I recite something? OK. So, 'Now is the winter of our discontent 'made glorious summer by this sun of York; 'but l, not shaped for tricks 'nor made to court a looking-glass, 'l that am rudely stamped and want love's majesty 'to strut before a wanton ambling nymph 'curtailed of fair proportion, 'cheated of feature by dissembling nature 'Sent...' 'Before... 'Before my time' 'Before my time, deformed, unfinished, 'And that so lamely and unfashionable 'that dogs bark when I halt by them. 'Why l, in this weak piping time of peace 'have no delight to pass the time, 'unless to spy my shadow in the sun 'and descant on mine own deformity. 'Since I cannot prove a lover to entertain these well-spoken days 'l am determined to prove a villain 'and hate the idle pleasures of these days.' lt's beautiful, I know... Shakespeare, Richard lll. William, Mathias. He's just moved to town. He's Marie's brother... Jean-Jacques said you have some leads on apartments. You looking? lt's for Mathias... l don't know, l'm looking myself... We'll go by your hotel, get your things, and go to my place. Your trunks at the hotel? Just a suitcase. l'd rather stay there. Please... - Room? - 610. Fuck you... Fuck off... Come and get me, instead of playing with me... You left the head. Why notjust give it to me? lt wasn't you? Yes, it was you! living with it l'm Paul Macaigne. l won't see you until the 2nd semester. l'm a doctor, not a teacher. lf you wish to change your specialization after today, see the secretary. You won't be the first nor the last to do so. Let's begin. You note the observations. Autopsy number 16134. Patient: unidentified. Clinical information: none. Circumstances of death: Circumstances of death? l do not know. To be determined? To be determined, good. Subject is of medium build, fair skin, black hair, a bottle has been pushed into the anus... Various lesions. Extract it. Put gloves on, too. Turn him over... Plastic bag! Like this? Get a good grip! Help him, damn it! There's 8 or 9 of you! Six: Teeth perfect; yellowish in color. Seven: Nostrils obstructed by dried blood. Eight: Round burn marks on the chest... probably from cigarettes, also on the genitals: testicles... penis. Weigh the heart. 450 grams. What are we looking for?... You! l don't know. There are external lesions, so we look for internal injuries, from the blows. The burns: before or after death? Before. Check hematology. The bottle? Before death. Significant bleeding... Bruising of the perineum. They'll plead involuntary homicide, extenuating circumstances. We'll prove otherwise. How many people raped him? Was it rape? They'll say he was willing. Analyze the sperm: is there one type, or several? How many? You're sick? Because of that little whore? The bottle up his ass? Rather diagnose a thrombosis? Too dirty? You'll tell his family, your son's death makes me vomit! These are your patients! You're not here to cry. This is a job. You determine the cause with the evidence. No more crying or vomiting! Excuse me, do we note our honors? No, just your year, 89-90, and the name of the university. Right... Thanks. Sure... Mathias Barillet... like 'barrel'... That's a new one. You in forensic, too? Don't touch! Yeah, this is my 6th semester... Simon Asher: forensic and pathology... You're Jewish? What's it to you? l don't know, I just asked. l didn't think... Well don't! Do I ask if you're an anti-Semite? l didn't mean to offend! 'Offend?' Who are you? You're out of it! l have nothing against Jews, OK? The word 'Asher', in German it means... Oh! lt's my name! At least it's not my big nose! l'm not 'the Jews'! As for my name... Fuck you! l don't like you, OK? l'm upset because someone left something in my things... And l... l don't know what to do with it. lt's all I can think of. lt's got me upset. What is it? A person's head... What? lt's crazy. Someone gave me a head. Wait... lt was in my things... Someone put it there. Oh, they're savages... Germans... l swear, I have a man's head. Give it to the cops... l don't understand, and l'm not interested. Maybe l'm not supposed to... Perhaps I have it for a reason... You're bound by the law... You can't keep a cadaver. Penal code, article 359. Or unlawfully disturbing a corpse, art. 360. Or obstructing justice... l've been trying, but I can't... l can't throw it out. You should, it's trouble... Throw it out or give it to the cops. See you. l was insulting him... the entire time he was searching your suitcase. l never took my eyes off him. - Something missing? - No... Well, yes. That's serious... He hardly touched your things... l must have forgotten them... Problem? Just some papers... l'll call dear old mom. You're dumb... You could have used the diplomatic pouch. l'm here in my office... in my little box... supposedly making history. - Rich kid! - Look who's talking. My father was a civil servant. We wanted power so much... The right schools, and now we're getting exactly what we wanted! Pretty, isn't it? Top secret clearance. The magic card. Jealous? Not at all. The jerk is jealous! lntelligence credentials have to be earned! l can't promise you anything. Maybe the landlady will have something else for you... l've got to find a place. Staying with friends. Fucking parasite. l'm in a hotel. That's awful! What do you do? Besides hotels. Medical school. General? No, pathology... forensics... the morgue. Great! That's different. lnteresting? What's funny? You're the first person to say that. Most people find it... horrible. They're idiots. The morgue, that's great! Light switches, door handles, etc. The tenant provides his own. Stolen once, won't happen twice. What'd she say? She won't come down. 9,500 francs... l can go to 6 or 7 thousand, but shit! Too bad, it's really nice. How much can you pay? A thousand, 15 hundred... Enough for a maid's room... 9,500, what a bitch! 7,500 - 2,000? We share? Big bedroom or small? The small one's fine for me. We don't even know each other! William Mah?... What do you think? l warn you, l'm hard to live with... l don't like talking to guys. Girls, OK, but... - We don't have to talk... - OK. - No kidding? - Yeah. Let's grab it. lf you're responsible... But we're always responsible for those around us. Maybe you feel more responsible for some things because you want to. Out of pride? l don't know what to tell you. Are you religious? l'm not, perhaps he was. You said he was dead. You did tell me he was dead? There's nothing to be done. lf l'm the only one that knows someone's dead... There's been no burial... The body's there... As if... it's waiting. l should make sure that it has some dignity. Here, we celebrate a funeral mass and a benediction at the burial. Not a sacrament, just a blessing... holy water and consecrated earth. There's no magic. You need at least 2 people for a sacrament, a priest and a believer. lf you don't believe, l can do nothing with a corpse. A mass, is that it? Why? lf you don't believe... Have to bury him, I guess, or cremate him... l'm closing up. No sacrament for a corpse. lt's nothing. lt's an object. So I can kick it? Hit it? No, a mass. But not here. What's his religion? l don't know. What's the difference? None at all! lt depends on you! We refuse no one. remorse Up already? lt's 5 o'clock... l'm going back to bed. You all right? Finished? Bring him back to the shop. Give them his file. Shit, what the hell is he doing? Waiting for your dad again? Don't you ever work? Excuse me! lt's lunchtime... You look chilly. lf you want to warm up inside... Cut-up bodies don't interest me. You're scared! No, I couldn't care less. l've been here for two hours! Hold this. l have to go by my office... Goddamn it! Why's that idiot looking at us? Must be a hick... He thinks you're cute. l'll ask him... You didn't scare him? He thought you were related to the victim! He apologizes... 'Please be so kind as to excuse me.' A hick. When you're done, start it up. Wait 10 minutes, don't forget this. Pick up the phone if it rings. Last Name: ? First Name: ? Sex: Presumed to be male Nationality: ? Age: ? Skin Color: White Hair Color: Grey Religion: ? Coming to eat? No... You can leave it there... Wait... - Want a drink? - Wait... lt's like the lndians, the Jivaros. Except it's a white man. ls it old? l don't think so. 6 months to a year and a half. lt's fresh! Who is it? You know who gave it to you, don't you? Not really. lt doesn't matter. Have to take care of it... You're crazy. lf he'd just died, OK, but this... Don't touch it! Sorry... Just don't touch it. What're you doing with it? Don't know. Just taking a look... Bury it? When you want to tell me where you got it, l'll be around, OK? Mathias... l'm not German. Sorry for the other day... l should beg your pardon. No, I was upset... Mathias Barillet. l know, I asked my father. Claude. Sit down... l'm waiting for dad. Maybe he's upstairs. Studying math? The diagrams... No, art history. Art history! That's great! l'm enrolled. I don't go to class. You should. Can I see? What is it? A diagram: the eyes of 2 people looking at each other. That's clever... Shall I explain it? Don't make fun of me... l'll finally get to use this. Look at my left eye. Like this? Only the left one. Don't move. l look at your left eye. See how it seems to slip...? Keep looking at my left eye... l'll look at your right eye. There. You see? Yeah, I see you. You see my gaze. Our gazes cross. Otherwise they slip. They cross each other, right here. We see each other there... l'm sorry, l'm so stupid. No, l... l made you think... No, it was me. I apologize... Want me to come with you? No, you can't come with me! lf you'd rather that I not, if it would... - But I would like... - Listen to you! l can't. l'm not available. Staying? - You mind? - No. - Not too bored? - No. - When's the last metro? - You have time. You sing well, l'm impressed. Not yet. You have to learn the metro... You buy a pass? This is a metro map, here's your station. OK. Do you have a credit card? No, I have to open a bank account. You haven't much money. lt's weird... with them. No big deal. Money problems aren't fatal. You look worried. No... not especially... What is it? l just got here... everything's new to me! - lt's new! - Yeah. lt's the lnstitute, too. When l'm in the dissection lab it's like... l'm at the center, where everything's still the same. lt's calm, you know what to do... When I leave, l'm out of synch... ln the metro, there are lots of bums. France is really poor... People have a hard time. What is it? You think we're not on earth to have a good time. Some people think... We're here to laugh... There are two kinds of people. You're one... or the other. That's stupid. lt's amazing... l was like that, but l'm changing. - That's good. - I know. Great, bravo. William will get you out a little... - You two get along? - Fine. the ambassadors When was this? 1974. - Know what it is? - No. lt's a prisoner exchange at Wiethausen, on the border. 5 years ago, the guards killed a guy there. French citizens are prisoners in Russia? Not any more... There were, it's over now. Soldiers, POW's. 200 French in the Gulag. We couldn't get them out. Khrushchev, Brezhnev... 10, 20 years went by. Hardliners, you know... Giscard negociated for the living, but we never got the dead out. Look. Well? lt's the guy from the train. You're sure? lt's not very clear, but... it's him. He's our nightmare. His name is Louis Bleicher. He worked for us for years. A lot of personal reasons... and his own personal methods. Committed... Russians go for that... A reason to fight can be a reason to fight for them. lt's a weakness, like a cramp. After the war, his job was the men detained in the USSR. His brother was in the Gulag. Will his brother get out? He's been dead for years, but Bleicher wanted his body. We wanted the living, Bleicher wanted the dead, too. He crossed the border, on foot in '73, and of course, he was arrested. He did a year of prison. This is his liberation. Bleicher came back to work here, but with different duties. The technology section... Scientific development... DGA, COCOM France. They watch us. He hasn't been to work for 3 months. We don't know where he is, or what he's doing. l really don't know what he wants. l don't like that... So I ask you... Did Bleicher say... anything in particular? No. He checked my papers... But he did speak to you? He said that... l was a bastard... Well, you are. Why me? What did I do? You tell us! Give you anything? Why would he have given me something? The papers? - The papers that were missing. - I found them in my trunk. Mr. Barillet... if Bleicher contacts you, if you remember something... please contact me. That's taken care of... Sorry about all that... but we were worried about you. lt's Jean-Jacques, l'm fine. You've changed. l mean, you've grown up. So serious. l like to meet shy people... l see myself in them. We look a bit alike, no? The hair... Not the beard... We'll get Bleicher... l knew his father, a tall, serious man... He died 11 years ago. 13 years. Good to have you back! Leave your childhood behind, as we must, in politics. Welcome home. See you later. Goodbye, Mathias. You know everybody! Not really... l'm a doctor. Come on! Your dad was one of us. You know Jean-Jacques, Varins... You're a star! Bleicher found the perfect messenger! What? You know everybody, you're a good messenger. - This it? - No, Number 7. - ln mind... - Mathias! ln mind, only in mind. - You have someone in mind? - What? From a distance. l don't have a chance... lncredible! A secret life... l know someone, that's all... ln mind... You think Bleicher is a spy because he went after his brother. That he's crazy... l think it's a good thing. Don't you? The guy is a spy. He isn't good or bad. He's with our enemies. lf he does something for us, it's against us. The question is, who are you with? Good thing he didn't kill you, except that makes you his ally. Or you can be a 'double agent', get it? No. Pay some attention to your guests, shit! Give me a break! l don't want to patronize you, Mathias, but I know what a spy is, it's my job. He's a snitch, he sells stuff to anybody... Moscow, the Americans. He's so cheap. Everybody uses him. He gives us visas, names, dissidents, military... He's scum... l don't know what to say to your friend. Nothing at all. Absolutely nothing. Don't leave me alone, OK? Come on, let's go. Don't be too mean, all right? After the war, way out on the Taiga, in one of the camps... lt was very cold! 40, 50 below! ln desperation, the prisoners would cut off a hand with an ax so they wouldn't have to work. They took the cut-off hands and hid them in the wood, shipments of timber tied up in wire to be exported. The wood arrived in England, First load... cut-off hands. Third load, more hands. Human flesh! The English say, 'What is this?' To holy Mother Russia! Before you leave, we'll introduce you to people who can help you prolong your visit and then come back. Or, they can get in touch with you in Moscow. You'll have to write to Mathias. A postcard from the mausoleum, he'll like that! You OK? Yeah... l'm drunk... They wear on you. 'Ah, little lady, they're civilians.' 'Civilian asses.' What's this all about? Varins helps people get out of Russia... Our show is part of it. 30 people go in, the same 30 leave, except for 1. Me. l come back later, discreetly... The Dutch Embassy helps. lt's not dangerous. They've already done it. l can't really sing. They say my range is limited. Not enough voice. You smoke... l talked to mom. Ah, mom. How is she, mom? She's worried about your relationship with William. She wanted to know if you're homosexual. l told her... No, mom, we're totally normal... Mathias isn't homosexual, and my range is limited. Everything's fine. Remember when you told dad you wanted to go back to France? He looked at you very seriously, and said he understood. He missed France too, but we had to stay in Aachen because he was like a sentinel at the border. That it was the best thing he could do for France... He was so boring! He was hard. Everyone was like that, then. l'd forgotten him... Shit, was it awful living there! Everything OK? Hang in there, hard work pays off... What are you doing here? l wanted to see you. l was coming by here, so I just came by. You can't just come by! You told me art history... l couldn't tell you I was coming... l'm with friends. l can't talk to you. You can't just show up like that! l'm sorry about what happened in the cafe. Mathias, l'm with a guy, there... But it wouldn't work, anyway. We're not the same. How do you know? l just know it wouldn't work. l don't agree. For example, l'm really interested in painting. l can tell you some names of painters. - We going? - Yeah. Michelangelo, Leonardo da Vinci, Van Gogh, Gauguin... Wait at the cafe... Monet, Renoir, Monory... You see, we're the same... You with the big guy? l'd watch out for a guy like that. You don't even know him! You're right, I was joking... l'll never be with you anyway! - Watch out for big guys, anyway. - OK. Stop it! lt's OK, he's gone ahead. Shall we get some coffee? - What do you want? - I don't know. Get to the point! You want something, don't you? You ask me like that, I don't know. l'd like to see you. l don't know, l... l think I want to go out with you, is that how they say it? l don't know if we'll get along... l came to see, just in case we did get along. - You hate women. - No! You're morbid, that's easy to see! Like anyone. And pushy. - l'm not pushy. - Yes you are. - You know you are. - No. You're pretty pushy, aren't you? See! I hardly know you, and we already disagree. l like you, but it would never work. l don't agree. Even if I don't agree with you l get along with you. Don't come see me any more. And don't call me, either. lf I don't... Stop. Stop... all right? l can write... You're not going to write. Letters are... Don't be pushy, OK? You're not going to write. l don't know where to write, anyway. That's good. - lf I don't write... - Yeah. And I don't call... And there's the other guy... We won't see much of each other! l told you... we can't be together. lt's ridiculous. You're such a drag! Maybe... I could take you to the theater. My sister is singing in an opera. Well, it's an opera recital... l'm not going to see your sister! No, you're right, that would be dumb. my best enemy Are you eating here? Yeah, I think so... Like a rat? Yes, William, like a rat. You want to eat out? l've got to work. What? Just work. You're serious. l've eaten at home maybe 3 times in 5 years. OK, l'm off. Mathias... Show me something, tell me something. What's this? You want to convert? lt's for my work. Show me your work. Don't look at that, it's not interesting. lt's very interesting! lt's not interesting to you! lt's the world, it's like that... What the hell is going on in your head? l'm going. Shit! Does Jean-Jacques know? Of course not! You're still together? Lord, I have sinned, how I have sinned... l know... but when you grow up you'll see that sometimes boys and girls spend the night together... OK, OK... Don't tell anybody. There's only one reason to do something... Because you want to. Are you a virgin? You're unbelievable! l can ask, can't l? Mathias, you up? l made coffee. He's a little common! Can you come here for a second? l don't know if I should answer someone as depraved as you... But yes, l've already done it. - Sleep well? - Yes. Come on in. lt's nice. Not bad. Come in late? Yeah, l'm beat. What time is it? 8:45. Christ, l'm late. Jean-Jacques'll kill me! Last night, did you try to get in my room? No. Come here. Look... No, it's just that last night... Don't tell me you didn't, if you did. Lying is stupid. - I just needed a match. - Right. Look, let's stay friends. One simple rule... You have your side, I have mine. We don't mix up the two. lt's better for everybody. lt's clear and simple, we can stay pals. lt's no big thing. Just need to talk about it. Your side, my side. Everything's great. For 2 hours, the assholes wouldn't let me in! This is police property. Listen, it's war. Your ghost, Bleicher, is in France. l don't care. They're going crazy at the office. l came by to get you. l'm not going. l'm a doctor! Shit! What are you doing here with your big car? lt's embarrassing! lt's weird! A big car is nice! Then get in it! lt's cold out! l've been here for 2 hours! l don't care! Leave, get out of here! lt's cold! Then you'll be cold too, my lord! - Let me go in with you. - No! One filling on top of another. What is this shit? Not even Turkish gold... Where'd you get it? ln the lab... The work looks bizarre. A Russian filling... What? A Russian filling... done by a Russian dentist. The work is so different from what we do here. One filling on top of another. They drilled around the first one, with something pretty wide. The tooth is cracked. l don't know what they use, but it's superb. lt's not lead. Nickel? lt's nickel. Magnificent! How old? 37. Right. The first filling, when he was 8 or 10, in the 1960's. Screwed it up. Put another right over it, 20, 25 years later. You're puffing like a steam engine. You're almost running. You have to be proud! You're worth so much more than me. l want you to live well. l'll see to it. Liar. Don't speak too soon. Don't you see how Jean-Jacques lusts after you? l'm saying this now because it's as if l never saw you before... Like l'm seeing you for the first time. Marie Barillet, we'll live a long, happy life. - What'd you say? - Nothing. What's that look? You're looking at me, too. Did you see your friend outside? Yeah. He's sort of hard to get rid of... You done? Lucky you. l've been done for an hour. Pass me those. These two? Shall we go? l've got a thing to finish, take me 5 minutes. See you, then. Shit! l'm going to the theater to see your sister. - Tonight? - Yes. l'll see you there. We can go together in my car. You have everything, let's go. l waited for you at the institute. You didn't show up, so I went back to my office. What are you doing? Get me some smokes, OK? This way. l can't. l'm double-parked. You can leave that. lt won't fly away. Thanks. l've been here 2 hours, my head's about to explode. Where's William? He's here. Marie and Nathalie. Put some life in it. l've got something in my throat... Recess! Time for a little break! Philippe! William looked for you all day. Didn't know l'd see you tonight. My roommate. lsn't he handsome? You're not scared? lnnocence itself, nothing to hide. - Excuse me... - Stop it. William, you're terrible! OK, nothing in his pockets. lt's over now. Watch your driving! Are you scared? You should be, too, idiot. - You have my bag? - Yes. You want something? My cigarettes. Take one of mine. l may be stupid, but not scared. l'm a good driver and l'm pretty brave, too. Not brave, oblivious. ls there an ashtray in this heap? Of course. Here's an ashtray. Thanks. Go ahead, put it out! Go on. You said I wasn't brave. Put it out, you'll see. l'm not going to burn you, you poor fool. l don't care. l just said, l'm pretty brave. Right, Mathias? Yeah. l'm not afraid of pain. Stop it! - Put it out! - OK, I believe you! Too late! Stop! lt hurts, but l'm not afraid. At least consider the fact that l'm in severe pain! Here, Marie. Thanks. Here. You OK? Yeah. You're sure? Yeah... Nathalie is such a fool! Got any gauze? Under the sink, in a green bag. There's antiseptic, too. You put that on it? That's asking for infection. Never put that on a wound! lt protects it. You're really good at this. Come on! Must be the second or third time l've worked on a living patient! A guy at the office saw Bleicher today. He was at the station while I was looking for you. He talk to you? Yeah. That's a problem. Well? Nothing. I saw him for a minute. - You have a TV, at your place? - No. Where do you live? 25 rue R?aumur, in the 4th with another guy. There! You know some guys! That's good, you see people. You see people, you make phone calls. He asked me if I had a TV. What l'd have done in Chaing Kai Chek's place. Are the guys you know happy? Yes... I don't know. No. l know. They're very happy, everybody's happy. These guys on TV, these fat sacks of shit... they say, 'lt's the end of the post-war.' They don't know if the Oder-Neisse border is right, but it's the end of the post-war! Once, a man saw a family. The girl's breasts were bare, so was the mother's ass, and the father was completely naked. They were sitting by their shack, cleaning specks of gold. A new world was born in 45-46, armed! Allied planes took off from ltaly to bomb Dresden. Everyday they flew over the railroad that went to Auschwitz, and not once did a bomb happen to fall out there. A bomb would have cut the tracks. After the war, we weren't creating paradise, that's do-gooder bullshit, the UN and all that shit. Wejust wanted to make a world where none of this could happen again. So we cut it in two. The good guys on one side, with me, here. And on the other side, my brother, there with the bad guys. Between us, there was a cemetery with all the unburied dead, in limbo. One side, the other side. And no one crossing over. Sir? Nothing. You can't sit here, then. Pardon? Coffee. lt was a war with no dead. Not many dead... lmmobile... East against West, Abel and Cain, the sons of Adam. lf Abel moves, Cain bashes him. That can start again, no enemies to stop us. Who's going to stop us? Who? We gave the East the means to hold on. Now they're giving in. Bullshit. 'We're not communist anymore, we changed our minds.' They'll tear each other apart. We won ad nauseam. l need the guy's name. He's a Russian scientist. You have his head, I need his name. He said nothing special. The guy's crazy. He talk about us? No. What then? l told you, nothing. lone rider - ls your father here? - No. Shit, it's stuffy in here. lt's OK. lt's nice... it's pretty big. He lives alone? lt's a fucking disgrace. No, it's fine. No, it's a disgrace. Now, you'll look at my books, and see there's nothing but trash, and you've read a lot. Fuck it, I don't give a shit. Laundry room. Not bad. Stop... l'm really tired. - We're not sleeping together. - No. We'll sleep. Yeah, where? Open that thing. What? What is it? You thirsty? You want anything? A glass of water. To the left. Please, come here. ls it in your briefcase? Just thejaw. l take what l'm working on. The rest is at a friend of my sister's. There's no danger, it's mummified. She's pretty cool, keeping that around. lt's gross. She doesn't know what it is. She's never home, anyway. Push the signal, will you? What? Why don't you? lt's Shabbat. I can't. What? l can take the bus, but the signal is electric. You should take the metro. Can't take that at all. A car, then. l can't drive on Saturday, but I can ride the bus. The metro's the same. l won't do it either. That's our stop! Shit! l know. lt's OK, it's Saturday, we'll run a little. lt'll do us good. There's one vertebra left. The patient was about 6 feet tall. Fairly fat. Before, anyway. Probably quite strong. A slight scoliosis, I think. The bone is slightly deformed. Blood type: B positive. That's too precise. Did you use the skin? No, the skin is dried out. Traces of blood cells in the bones. Why the blood type? What do you want? To identify the guy? No, it's just that... For example, l'm O positive, and he's B positive. That's all. Hi, Mr. B positive! Hair: light brown and grey. White, afterward. Balding. He was 36 or 37 at the time of death. 36 or 37? l think so. Place of death? An island south of Sumatra, K?ging. Chromography of the vegetal paste. lt's only found on K?ging. Death occurred 8 months ago, in March. How'd you date it? The skin. The action of the embalming agent on the skin and part of the brain. Cold sore scars are visible inside the cheeks. Traces of some kind of industrial lead in the pores. Lead stays in the skin. He must have looked like this. Square jaw, prominent cheekbones, a Caucasian type. And small eyes. You did it here? Yeah. One other interesting detail, he was left-handed. You've his hands? No, micro-photos of the teeth. You pulled teeth? A small piece of jaw and 1 filled tooth. Look, the marks of brushing are clearly visible. Direction of the brush marks indicates the left hand. So, 1 - he had good hygiene, and 2 - he was left-handed. Mathias, we're not saints. Nobody is a saint. lt's still a man. l didn't see any of this. You have to get rid of it. Let's go. He says if you want to bury someone, the ashes must be blessed. ln the Orthodox Church, we always bless the body of the deceased. l have this, if it's enough. There's no body. l'll put my stuff away down here... in the closet. l won't touch, l'm not curious. Talkative. No, l'm not. You shouldn't stay so late. Because of William... He asked me what you do over here. lt's OK, I didn't say anything! l'm supposed to watch you. Don't worry, I don't. William and his little power games. You still with Jean-Jacques? We've been together so long. l'm going to Brussels. My plane's in an hour. l'm in a rush. l looked in your room for a match. - You mad at me? - No. - Yes you are. - No. Who cares about health! What are you doing? Cleaning up my room. Come on in here. Clean up later. Be gone long? No, just overnight. l'll be back, never fear. Can I close up? Forget anything? Listen, calm down... The rehearsals went well, so will the opening night. But if I screw it up, shit! l'm getting older, l won't get the same roles. - lt has to be now. - You'll be fine. l'm scared! l'm not here for my voice. But I know I can sing. You're helping them, that doesn't mean you can't sing. lt's two different things. Don't you see? lf Varins blinks, l'm out. He hesitates, and that's it, the end. What are you up to? People look at me like l'm a leper. You and I are only tolerated. They're not our friends. So can't you leave them alone? l'm not coming here any more. With William, things are very tense... See how you are! lt's crazy! What are you doing to these people? You screw up my life, at least tell me what you're doing! l'm taking care of someone... who's dead. l'm taking care of his memory. l'm alive! Can't you think about me? l don't want to know about it! What gives you the right to interfere? They get people out of Russia. You think you're so smart! You'll keep me from singing. l don't... l know. You don't want to hurt anybody. But you do. You hurt me. Why are you always around, getting in the way? lt's my life! So why are you still here? l'm scared. l'm sick to my stomach. lt's nothing. You have to go. l can't do anything for you. l don't even want to. l don't want to see you. war Nathalie? l just came to get something. Don't get up. Don't do anything stupid, OK? Don't worry. Name? Mah?, William. M-A-H... No, the man in question. l don't know it. lt'll take all morning. No name? Nationality, Soviet. That's right. Date of birth? 1941, 42. That's only 10 or 20 thousand files. Profession? Scientist, I think. l hope so. l know his blood type. Doesn't help. Hair color, body type? You can't take the file out, you'll have to read it here. May I see the cover sheet again? l'll send it to you. Answer me! What are you, a mummy? Answer me! He won't talk. l'm thinking. l can't think, so talk, please! Good old Mathias sure won't help. Leave him alone. What do I do? Stay with Nathalie. She likes you. Then break up with her. What's it get me, if I dump her? She's a great girl and l'm an asshole. As long as I stay, she'll be a slut. Even Mathias has the keys to her place. You want the keys? Here... Just kidding. l'll marry her. Blitzkrieg! l killed him, l'm the best. Brussels is so ugly! 8 AM bullshit meeting! Well, take a shower. The head was working, the head gets washed. You'll smell like a mule. You the kind of guy puts perfume on his dick? You asshole. l'm so sick of your bigshot act and your gross jokes. What's with you? My language shocks you? Not funny enough? l'm tired of your bullshit, your jokes, Brussels, the whole thing! No need to say that for me. What about Brussels? l was working. Fuck off. You don't need Brussels as a cover. What? While I work, you talk. So if I were you... You don't need excuses to fuck Nathalie. l left yesterday. l just got back. At 8 AM you were at the Secret Service. This yours? Yes. lt's Kolchaguine's file. l'm giving his name to Bleicher. Do I scare you that much? What did I do? William, tell me. Mathias, I get military engineers out of Russia. And I make a lot of money doing it. They are people who want to leave, and can't. They have special technology, that people want. You sell slaves. Philippe set this up alone. He helps people, alone. He talks, makes calls, smiles. Alone. l sent Kolchaguine, a gas warfare expert, to work in Sumatra. He ran off into the jungle. You punished him, alone. Not at all. The hell with Bleicher. He's a pig -- thick, stupid. You're giving him that Russian's name? Where is he? What's he tell you? What's he offer you? He whistles and you come running? Where's the head? At Nathalie's? Mathias, l'll have to... What do we do? l'll erase every trace of that asshole Kolchaguine. He almost blew everything. l will erase him. What are you doing here? The jaw's missing. Where is it? ln my room. lnside the globe. Mathias, hurry up. Mathias, shit. Put the gun down, come on. Let's get this over with. Get out! Stop it, old man. You don't know how to use it, the safety is on. Christ, what do you want? l'll take the jaw, you stay here, use the phone. Get out! Don't touch that! l'm coming in, take it, and leave. Stay here, if you want. William, I swear to God, cross that doorway, l'll kill you! l'll kill you! The neighbors! Cross that doorway, l'll kill you! Calm down. What happened? Opening night. Look at the Russians. There they are... in their cheap suits. l can't eat with them. lt's too much for me. l want to see Philippe de Varins. Sorry sir, private party. lnvitation only. l forgot mine. My sister is singing. l don't care. Tovaritch! Look, comrade! Come here! Kolchaguine, your citizen, is missing. Do you want him? Look... A piece of death. You know where your traitors go? Varins sells them! lt's the truth! lt's detente. l'll give you your traitors! Let him go. Get out of here. Happy now? Asshole! l'll close the gate. Want me to call the cops? Kolchaguine! Military engineer! Come and get him! Get your soldiers! That's enough now. l often think of Russia. l think, 'The world is forty years old.' lt's stupid, but I often think that the world is brand new. lt's so old and so new at the same time. Everyone says Russia must be freed, there's nothing to defend, my father was wrong. Everyone acts like it will go well. l don't know. Our fathers built a world, and we're not giving it a chance... lt's as if everyone had forgotten. Our fathers wanted a world like a mausoleum, and today we have no respect for the dead. The war killed as many people as live in France. We live on a billion dead. To help you sleep. And it's as if we spit on them. We want to forget it all. l think about mass graves. l see images of this one, or that one. lt's strange. lt could have been so different. So, you're a doctor? Yes. My father was a diplomat, l'm a doctor. A pathologist. Subtitles by Jeffrey Frohner Subtitling Titra Film Paris
