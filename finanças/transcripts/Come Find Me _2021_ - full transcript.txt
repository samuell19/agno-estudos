(light music) - [Caller On Voice Mail] Hey, Christina, listen, I know you've been through three drafts on this already, but the client came back and asked for some more revisions. Hey, it's me. I think you're flying again. I haven't heard from you in a few days, so I just thought I'd say hi. So hi. - [Caller 2 On Voice Mail] I keep being asked about the schedule and I have to check with Andy and obviously wants to get your timeline. (caller speaking in Spanish) (cell phone buzzing) - [Gloria] Christina, what did you do with my mortgage bills? I just wanna put them in the mail like I always do. I know, but I put it all on auto-pay for you, you won't have to do anything. - [Gloria] It's that easy, is it? - Well, that's what I do. My rent, my loans. I hear a ding on my phone. I get emailed a theme and loans paid. I have like eight of them. That's why my phone's always dinging. - [Gloria] Very funny, Christina. - So here are the critical docs, offer sheet, fairness opinion and peer group. - Good. Did you eat? - So bad. I stole like five of those pop chickens from the plane. Oh God. (light music) (cell phone beeps) - I was just in Atlanta doing a deposition. And then after this one was Cleveland. Hey, Jim. - Cleveland. - Yeah. How are you? - Well, you know what they say? Teaching law beats practicing law. How's your mom? - Oh, still going a hundred miles an hour. - She'll be excited to see you. - Yeah. - So Andy's got you flying all around the country. I told him you were a superstar. - I don't know about that. He's in town doing a deposition. I'm covering from another one. - So you wanted to talk to me? - Yeah. Well, you were so helpful, introducing me to Andy. I was wondering if maybe you had another recommendation for another firm? Maybe here. - They're not offering a partnership. - Oh, they are. I think two, three years. Who knows? I just, I keep having these conversations in my head about it. And sometimes I imagine I'm back in law school and I'm having that talk with you about taking the job in the first place. - You know, you graduated in the middle of the financial panic yet you wouldn't even consider a job here. You headed off to California and you've been marching down that road for the last six years. - Yeah. And it's good work. One day, I'm talking to an investment banker in the next I'm flying out to meet real estate developers and Andy's been very supportive. - Yeah, 'cause you provide value. - Sometimes I think it's more that I have time to give. If that makes sense. - Well, I'll start asking around. I'll be discreet. But if you leave before you make partner, you won't have any security. You know, sometimes work helps me make decisions. Like if I'm struggling with some personal thing, like, like when my son was sick and there were all the doctors and all that, and I just dived into my notes on some lecture and my mind would just work, work, work, work, work. And sometimes in a flash, the answer to the other thing would appear and I'd click open another window, start writing. And there it was. (cell phone buzzes) - Hey Marisol. (Marisol speaks in Spanish) You can call anytime what's, up? (Marisol speaks in Spanish) No one. It's just there to protect you. So you have the space to do what you need to do. (Marisol speaks in Spanish) I'm sorry. Can you speak in English? - [Marisol] Yeah. Sorry. My boss is gone now. I just didn't want him to understand me. - Oh, it's just, I barely remember Spanish and I only hear when my mom's yelling. - [Marisol] My mom is always yelling in Spanish. (speaking in Spanish) (light music) - The gym's closed. (cell phone buzzes) Marisol, what's going on? - [Marisol] I'm pregnant. I'm sorry. I wanted to tell you before, but- - It's okay. - I can't do this. I'm done. - It's okay, just breathe. Marisol? - [Marisol] I'm not, I'm not ready. - [Bob] Hey Christina, this is Bob from Lip Tech. Just responding to your additional keyword search. I couldn't find. - [Caller On Voice Mail] Hey, so I just sent you a long email, I'm gonna need you to write another revision. - [Caller On Voice Mail] So not sure if you saw the email, but Andy- - [Bobby] Hey, it's me, Bobby. I'm just checking in. Is everything okay? - [Joanne] Department of Education. This is Joanne. - Oh, hi. Good morning. I'm helping my mother move her retirement account online. - [Joanne] Ma'am she's gonna have to do that herself. I'm gonna need to put you on hold. - But I have her account information. Hello? - Hello. How we doing, everybody good? Not bad temporary digs, right? Christina, can I speak with you? So the judge asked for a revised version of the motion. I already gotta be in two different places at the same time today. - I mean, I can do it, but it'd be tight. Rose, she's working on Larry. - I cannot deal with her today. I never know when she's finished a fucking sentence. Everything goes up and up and up. Last week she comes into my office. She tells me the sixth circuit just came in and I think what it means is possibly I just tell me the decision. Don't think in front of me, every email starts with, hi, with an exclamation point at the end of it. - Yeah, well, I do that too, just not to you. - Well don't, I will block your partnership. - Just don't block hers. - She'll be gone in a year, probably already sending out her resumes. Anyway, this needs to go out by five and then you can prep for tomorrow. Rose has you covered on that? - Oh, I haven't even looked at it. She said the clients- - You'll win her over, whatever, this is good for you. Right, right. Not too much. (light music) - I could take a crack at it. - No, I got it. - Start it tomorrow. - Long version or short? - Short. - So this deal feels like it was brokered in Buffalo, not in New York. The price point is really low. Beautiful. How is Jay? - Oh, good. You know, busy. Like always keep telling him they should give him a cot by the trading desk. - Well, I really appreciate you squeezing me in like this. - Oh, it was great to see you. What's going on. - Well, I have a doctor back at home, but traveling and, I wanna make sure this is real. - Congratulations. Was it, was it a surprise? - I remember running last night. Is that okay? Yeah, of course. - And I had a cup coffee this morning. - A cup of day is fine. (cell phone buzzes) Do you need to get that? No, that's just my mom. - How is she? - Good. - Well, okay. So it looks like you left a couple blanks here. - Sorry, I'm always facing. - Yeah, welcome to pregnancy brain. So your last period was six weeks ago. Previous pregnancies, none. - One. Was a long time ago. - We can just finish this after the ultrasound, yeah. (cell phone beeps) (upbeat music) - I got here early because I wanted to speak to you now because I am completely jammed, but you were late so now I'm conferencing on another call. - Have to run. You are in excellent hands. - Hi. No, I can hardly hear you. This office is terrible. Can I call you right back? Yep. - We're borrowing a few rooms from another firm. We can go somewhere else. - Your bio is impressive and Andy speaks highly of you. How much time will you need from me tomorrow? - Well, we reserve the whole day. We'll walk through all the documents that are likely to raise questions to practice from. - You need a whole day for that? - We should review everything. - Haven't you done that already. - I'm familiar with the document. - You're familiar. Why am I paying you and an associate? What, a combined $1,200 an hour, plus what Andy's gonna charge me for that little introduction? - I'm sure he didn't bill you for that. - Of course he did, he's an asshole. But he's effective. Just not loyal enough to drop whatever it is he's doing to handle my deposition. I left Goldman to start my new company. And now that I'm small potatoes, I get the associate. - I want you to feel prepared to the questions for routine. - It's not routine, it's my life. The deal's being held up. My fees being held up. They're not claiming I did anything illegal. They're claiming I didn't broker a high enough price. They're claiming that I am incompetent. - These law firms troll for clients. They find anything that looks out of the ordinary. They announce that they're investigating. It's frustrating, but it's very common. - They're suing because I brokered the deal. This is personal. I already have meetings with clients tomorrow who are starting to get jittery because they're wondering is every bank she sells gonna get caught up in litigation. Every hour I pay you for is personal. So how much time do you need? (cell phone buzzes) - Hey mom, can I call you later? - [Gloria] Why did you not tell me you were in New York? Were you not going to see me? - I'm not in New York. - [Gloria] Luz Martinez saw you. She said you're staying at the hotel she works at. - Well, she must have been mistaken. - [Gloria] How can that be? - I don't know, but I'm working and I have to get back. I'm excited to see you soon. Mom? - [Gloria] I'm busy too. - Please keep this away from me. Let me know if there's an emergency. Otherwise, just tell everyone I'm sick. (mellow cello music) That's okay, it went to notification, ignore it. - [Andy] In my mind just, work, work, work, work. And open a window, start writing. And there it was. And sometimes in a flash, the answer to the other thing opens up to you. (melancholy music) (cell phone buzzes) - Marisol. - [Marisol] I'm sorry to call so late. Is this okay? - Yeah. What's going on. - [Marisol] Everything's different. I feel like, like everyone's looking at me, like everyone knows that I'm pregnant. - It's in your head. No one knows until you tell them, you can make a plan and get through this. - [Marisol] You just make it sound so easy. - Yeah. Well, when I was your age, everything was a secret. - [Marisol] I just, I just hate it so much. - But if you bottle all of that up after a while you become the secret, and then who are you? You know what I mean? Marisol? Marisol? - Come find me. (knocking on door) Hey, how's the, how's the prep going? - Did a girl named Marisol call? - A few times. Is she a client? - She's pro bono. - How do you have time for that? - I don't. Did she leave a message? - No, but you got a lot of other calls. Are you going running? I need to wake up. I'll see you. (light music) Marisol? Marisol? - Hey, just give me a sec. (upbeat music) - Christina. Christina, come on, Christina, open the door. What's going on that you can't tell me? Christina. - Mom. - Are you okay? - What are you doing here? - A guy named Bobby called my school to tell me that he was worried about you. And to ask me to check on you at this hotel in Brooklyn. Thank you, gracias. - What time is it? - Why didn't you tell me you weren't done- - Shit, I have to meet with a client in 20 minutes. - I am very busy too. I am missing an IEP meeting with parents of a child who needs many services. This might change the trajectory of his entire life. - Is it really that dramatic, mommy? - Yes. And why can't you take a moment to come see me? - I'm prepping a deposition. - What for? - It's a bank. The client's very important. - And you have to live in California to do this. You can get rich bankers richer right here. - Do you know how few women have made it as far as I have at that firm, a few women who look like me? - I get it. I know, but that doesn't give you the right to go through all my bills and all my paperwork as if I am some invalid who cannot open a statement once a month. What do you think the DOE is saying? - I'm trying to help you. The last time I was home, there was a pile of bills stacked on the table. You miss payments. You double pay. - I put time in my students not money, and that's my business, you mind your own. - Fine. I'll come see you tonight. - What time? - I don't know. I'll call you. - You changed your hair? - Yeah. - What have I done so wrong. (knocking) - Holy shit. - I still have 10 minutes to get ready. Can I have my phone please? - Yeah, your mom just called and Bobby called a few times. I told him you were really, really sick. - All right, come get me in five minutes. (phone rings) - Hey. - Hey. - How did you get my mom's number? - [Bobby] I had to Google her school. - Why would you call her? - [Bobby] Because I was worried. Rose kept going on and on about how sick you were. - No, I'm sorry. I'm not sick. - [Bobby] You know, I'm not a mind reader. If I did something wrong, you've gotta tell me. - I'm pregnant. - [Bobby] Ah. - Hello? - [Bobby] I don't know what to say. - I'm now gonna ask you a series of questions about your background. What colleges did you attend? And what degree was conferred? - I attended Queens College, bachelor of science and economics, 1993. - That's Queens, New York part of the city college system? - We can't all go to Columbia. - It says you attended from '87 through 1993. Was there delay in the completion of your degree due to academic or disciplinary reasons? - I took time off to work. - Earn any graduate degrees? - No. - Any certifications in advanced study for finance and securities? - No. - Your first job outta college. - I was hired as an analyst at STL. - We have you starting there in '95. Where were you before that? - I interned and I bartended anyone can Google me and see the deals that I have brokered. - Look, the plaintiff's attorneys are gonna ask you these questions they do it to raise doubts about you. You didn't go to Harvard. You didn't go to Wharton. They're gonna make you put that on the record. They're gonna ask you about your relationship with Mark. Where'd you meet him? How'd you secure him as a client. - They're going to imply that I had a relationship with Mark? Have you seen him? - I suggest you answer these questions with confidence. You presented this offer sheet to the board of directors we'll call document three. Is this the offer sheet you presented? - One moment. Yes, that is correct. - Right, and the standard is to share a report of comparable deals in the region to make it clear that the price for the bank is fair. It's part of what's called your fairness opinion. And yet you didn't choose any banks from the region. This is document four, peer groups. Did you present this? Hello? - Um, yes, that is the peer group. - And you included a bank in Harrisburg and another in Dayton, banks whose price points are closer to 1.3 or 1.4 times book, as opposed to any in the New York Metro where the comparable prices would be two or 2.1. - Do you have a question? - Well, any study of similar deals in the region would show much higher prices. It's like, you're pretending this deal's in a rust belt. Seems like a very low price. - It's not like we're talking about some bank that's headquartered on Fifth Avenue. This bank is based in Red Hook, Brooklyn. The market share is not likely to increase. It took me two years to find one buyer. Now, how do you expect me to say that without offending the board of directors and drive the price down even lower. - Christina, just turn it off. Marisol texted you. She said that her ex show up at her job sounded like an emergency. - Call the DA's office and tell that we need a restraining order enforced and give them Marisol's info on my phone. Then call her, tell her help is on the way, tell her to walk through her safety plan. - How much longer is this gonna take? - Just a couple more hours. - You alright? - Yeah. - Can we just get on with it? - We'll call this document five. Is this the fairness opinion you presented for vote to the board of directors at King South bank and was the vote unanimous? - No. - No, it wasn't unanimous. - No, this isn't the fairness opinion that I presented. These numbers are off. - Could she be wrong? There's like 30 different versions of it. I triple checked. - And did you ask the CFO if this was absolutely the latest draft. - Oh. Okay. Thanks. He's sending the correct draft. - Jesus. - Can you just keep going without it? - No, everything revolves around it. - I'm so sorry. - What are we waiting on? - We're just getting a print out of the correct draft. We can pick back up in about 20, 30 minutes. - You mean to say that you're putting eyes on this for the first time right now? - We made a mistake. - Andy said you were a star. You're in great hands. I put my star associate on it. His words. (light music) - [Andy] Is this Rose or is this you? - We fixed it. It's fine. - [Andy] No, it's not. She left me a voicemail yelling about malpractice, sounded like she was in a car. - She said she'd be back. - [Andy] I'm not sponsoring you for partnerships, you fucking chase clients away. While you're waiting. I need another motion drafted. Hold on. - Any word from Marisol? - Yeah. I spoke to her boss and he said that she left with Jason. - What? All right, just keep calling. And also I need some research. Go back 10 years, look up peer groups listed in every merger in the New York Metro and include Boston, LA and Chicago. Look for anything that sticks out. - Is he? - He's fine. I work so hard. Harder than I did in Boston. - Yeah, I know. But you've never worked for anyone else before. It's different. You have to listen more. - To what. - Are you there? - Oh yeah, go ahead. - [Caller] The judge has a problem with the language you put in there. (light music) - We have the correct draft now. Just wondering on her ETA. Hello? We have a lot more material to review. Can I speak to her? Well, where is she? - What are you thinking about? Must be something your eyes are burning a hole through that screen. - Why is it that no matter how hard I try not to make the same mistakes. - Are you talking about having the wrong draft of my fairness opinion? - No, that was comparatively minor. - Not to me. What is your most advanced degree? - JD. - Any advanced certification in mergers and acquisition law? - No. - Any specializations whatsoever? What makes you think you can conduct business with experts? - My whole life, I've been surrounded by people who don't look like me. Don't talk like me. I learned to ask myself questions. What are they thinking? What do they want? - What am I thinking? (light music) - [Assistant] Look, she's at her hotel, but she can't speak with you right now. - I understand. Just give me an address. I don't want anything, just an address. (light music) - We've been trying to get a hold of you all day. - You're upset. I get it, but- - All right, we have a bunny for you. I told her nanny to stay within five blocks of the hotel, but they went exploring, found a playground with some monkey bars. And of course her elbow popped out. I met them at the emergency room. I figured a dislocated elbow was a good enough excuse for a wine delivery. And this lawsuit was a good enough reason to make it a $200 bottle. - Thank you. - My kids have weak elbows, it's my husband's side. - Is he here? - He is back in San Francisco working and it's just easier for me to bring the nanny and the kids along with me. - I apologize, again, I- - Don't walk into a room unprepared, even if it's not your fault, people will use it against you. - If we could have two hours tomorrow morning before the deposition you'll feel very prepared. - With what, more legalese? If you're trying to justify a decision with words, good luck, words might as well be stones. - I've been researching peer groups, not billing it to make up for before I haven't finished yet, but I can provide you with some healthful data. - Do the work first, then promise. I'd never let my daughter do this in a million years. You sure you have his stomach for it? - I wanted to be a prosecutor. Then I interned for an ADA and realized that putting people in cages for a living's not for me. And I had to pay off my student loans. My mom she's worked in education 30 years, two master's degrees. And with the hours she puts in the out of pocket, it's minimum wage. And my dad got laid off. When I was a kid she worked weekends, cleaning houses, babysitting. I wanna see my kids on the weekends. - You have kids? - No. - Can I ask you something? That's a $200 bottle of wine. Aren't you the least bit curious to try it? - No, I'm very curious. I just. - It's none of my business, I'm sorry. - No, I, I just found out today. - Was it a surprise? - Oh yeah. - Well, I will drink for you because you are screwed. Who's the guy? - Another attorney, different firm. I told him today. - Don't tell anyone else. Not until you absolutely have to. When are you up for partnership? - Three more years. - Get that in writing. Do not let them defer you because you took time off for maternity because they will. - [Pat] How long have you been dating? - Six or seven months. He's really nice, I just, I just don't know him that well yet. - [Pat] How long does it take to know someone? I've been with my husband 20 years and sometimes still in the middle of the night I wake up and I look over at him and I just think who are you? (light music) - Mom? - So you went to law school here. You grew up here. You couldn't find a firm here to hire you. - I just felt like I could live my whole life in one place in one way, or I could see what else was out there. Maybe even be someone else. You know? - I do. - And I love it there, I go running every day. And you can see city and mountain beaches all in one run. It's like this whole world opens up around you. It's takes my breath away every single time. Still, I think that no matter how much everything around you changes- - It's still just always gonna be you. - Yes. - I may not have shown it, but I liked you the moment Andy introduced you, 'cause I saw myself with all that promise, all that baggage. - A long time ago, I was going through something. I don't know if I was dreaming it, but I saw the light inside of me. - An actual light? - I was so scared that people would see it. And I didn't understand that. I just wanted it to stop. And just as quickly it was gone and I missed it, and I'd always felt like I'd done something wrong, and years go by, and the other night it came back. I know it sounds stupid, but I felt that- (phone rings) - [Marisol] Hi, this is Marisol. Please leave a message. - Hey, I'm sorry I missed your calls. Could you call me back and let me know that you're safe. If, if you're worried at all, I'll send the cab to take you wherever or, I'll send you a plane ticket and you can come with me. Whatever you want. Just, just let me know you're okay. (knocking) - Hey, got your research. Did you talk to Andy? - No. - He asked me to fly ahead to Cleveland. - Are you okay? - Yeah. Yeah. Thank you for this. It's gonna help a lot tomorrow. - You should really call Andy. - Okay. - Oh, I forgot to tell you when I had your phone, somebody called a few times and I wasn't sure if it was an emergency. So I picked up, it was an old professor of yours. He said that there was someone he wanted you to meet before you leave town. - I'm not looking for another job. - I would never ever tell anyone. And no one would blame me if you were. This is so- - You just started. A year from now this is all gonna seem. What, normal? A year from now I'll be eight years from partnership. I applied for a job in Oakland. I think I might get it. It's this nonprofit. I'd get to work with people who aren't millionaires, weekends off. Of course they only have funding for 12 months and it barely pays, but. - It sounds like a great job for someone coming outta law school with a trust fund. - Yeah, I know how lucky I am. Tell myself all the time. - Sorry. That sounds great. - I'll see you in Cleveland. (light music) (indistinct chatter) - That's all, excuse me one sec. Hey, I called you last night. I even emailed. Did you check your inbox? - No. - I was able to move my deposition to tomorrow. I can take over here. You can go ahead to Cleveland. - No, I'm good. We worked it out. - She asked me to come. She insisted. - I was at her hotel last night. - Yeah. She told me. Did you offer to stay up all night and do extra research for free? Like you're some fucking junior associate at her bank. - I was trying to help. - Do not ever offer to work for free. It makes you look cheap. When you're getting sued you don't want a bargain lawyer. - I'm gonna go talk- - No, no, no, no, no. Look, she likes you. Okay, but this isn't personal. This is transactional. I don't want to be here. I haven't seen my kid in a week. Now get some sleep. You look terrible. - Jesus. - Oh my God, I'm sorry. You look tired. All right. Now, can I have the research you were working on last night? (cell phone buzzes) Please? - Hey, where are you? Are you okay? - [Marisol] Yeah. Sorry. I was up all night talking with Jason. I told him about the baby and he's excited. - He broke the restraining order less than a week after. - [Marisol] No, I asked him to come. - What? - [Marisol] I thought I texted you that. - Maybe you did. - [Marisol] We're gonna make a plan like you said, and maybe you're right. I should have waited to tell him, but I'm just so tired of secrets. - Of course. - [Marisol] Last night was the first time in so long I felt excited. Is that crazy? (light music) - Hey. - Hey. - You're back. - I am. - You didn't do anything wrong. It isn't like that at all. It's just not developing the way it should be at three and a half weeks. And probably this week it'll feel like you're having your period. This is common, actually. It doesn't mean anything long term. It happened to me before Carly was born. Twice actually. - I didn't know that. - After the second time I was feeling really low and Jay said, maybe we should take this opportunity to work on ourselves. Set some goals, learn a new instrument. Really decide who we wanna be. - Did you do it? - No, maybe he did. I, just wanted to be sad for a little while. (light music) (suspenseful music) Relieved I guess. At least that way we have time to figure things out. If we want that. - [Caller] If we do. - I'm sorry. I didn't return your calls I was going through something. I can't explain it. - Wow. If you wanna try I'm here. - [Charlie] Hey Christina, it's Charlie. Andy said you might have some time today to work on a brief. So I figured I'd call you and see. - [Caller] Andy's really stressed out and he's wondering where you are and- - [Caller 2] Hey Christina, wondering if we had some time today or tomorrow. - [Andy] Hey, Christina, what the hell were you thinking today? Are you on your way to Cleveland or not? And also have you been working on that petition? - [Bob] Hey Bob from Li tech, I'm actually gonna need some more. - [Caller 4] Hey Christina, I still haven't heard. - [Gloria] Please call me back. I'd like to see you before you leave. (light music) - [Christina] I'm right outside. - Where? - Have you been paying off my student loans with your retirement money? - Not all of them. Just a little. - I never asked you to do that. - Did you know your grandma sent me her pension checks. It killed me. It started when you were little and I was still in school. What was I gonna do? But I took them and I give you some of mine so I can remember her. And because, you are special, I knew it from the first moment I held you in my arms. It was like a lightning bolt went off. I knew you were meant for great things. And here you are partnership now and who knows? - I'm not gonna be partner. - Why would you say that? I just do the same thing every day. Day after day, I write about it. I prayed about it. I'm done. And I don't, maybe I'll come back here. I just wanna start over. - No, no, no, no, no, (speaks in Spanish), listen, you're not quitting. You've worked too hard. You've come too far. - Look at you. Look at what you do. I don't help anyone. - Think about the people you could help as a partner at the firm. - Now it don't matter. - It's important, Christina. - Don't do that. - Okay. So now you know what you want and what you don't and it's out and good. But running won't help you, you need more time. Let it come, until then you've got to go back California. - I can't even do that. I have to go to Cleveland. - Then you go and you take my love with you wherever you go. We're pioneers. Remember when I told you that? (speaks in Spanish) (light music) - I think about you all the time. - I'm sorry. - Mm-Hm. Call me when you get there. - Excuse me. Good morning. - Thank you. - Yes. - There's no parent coordinator on the east door. - Vicky's already heading down that way. You ready for your big weekend? - I'm going to keep power walking until I fit into that dress. Another parent tour? - Yes. - You have any of those? (speaks in Spanish) - Pasculi's got that one, Regaria's got the one upstairs. We had a vandalism in the bathroom. Pauli's on his way now to clean it up. - More of the same. - Yeah. There's definitely some genital like drawings reminds me of Carlos. - Vegas, I remember. - Yes. - Excuse me, did you wash your hands? - No. - Go back in there. I shouldn't have to keep reminding you. - Patricia asked me to tell you that your doctor called. - Oh, what's wrong? - Ray's feeling a little sick and the nurse won't be in until nine. - Hm. (both speaking in Spanish) Take him to the office and get him a bucket. - Feel better, buddy. Come on. Remember that we have the vote for honor society today at lunch. - We already did that. - Yeah, but we needed to reschedule that one. - Excuse me, you just wasted five minutes of your class time and you can't get that back. Go. - Reminder 9:30, we're going to be sitting in on Karen's new drama unit. - As soon as I are you going to sneak in all those things? - I just thought we'd go and see. It could be fun. - Yes. It could be fun. But what's the purpose or is it just another entertaining thing someone is asking them to do? (speaking in Spanish) - So we have Roberto from Mrs. Earls class to join you this morning. - Wonderful. Good morning students and teachers. My special guest for morning announcements is Roberto from Miss Earl's class. And what is this nurse showing us? - It's my all about sharks. - And what's it all about peace? Is it a story? - No. It's a research report. Just to read it all about a topic. - And what are these parts? Shark habitat, shark diet. How do sharks protect themselves? - My chapters. - What a smart idea to organize your report into chapters. Are you ready for the pledge, Roberto? - A pledge allegiance. - To the flag. - To the flag of the United States of America. - What's your character's name? - Caroline. - Caroline. Oh, that's a fun name. Hey, how does Caroline move? - Oh, kind like a Do-si-do sort of thing. Okay, well now you're building a character. That's awesome. - Thanks. Do you have the attendance too? - Yep. Got that right? You haven't heard anything from the superintendent yet, have you? - Heard what? - Well, you know, I know they have to open up your job to the whole district once you retire next week. I just wondering if you hear anything from Carmen yet? - Nothing. How's the basement coming along? - Oh, well we have rented a power standard for the weekend. I just, I hope that Tina knows what she's doing because I do not. - Aren't you eating? - Hey, remember that We have the vote for Student Honor Society. - We already voted. - Yes. Yep. But we really need to vote again. - Why. No. - Agnes already bought the cake? - I told you absolutely no party. - You did. And Agnes bought a cake. - Surprise! (all applaud) (all cheer) - So you obviously, you don't officially retire for another two weeks. - Don't say that word. - Yes. But we just wanted an opportunity to thank you for all the amazing work you've done here. It's 12 straight years, right? Yes. - Yeah. - 12 straight years of the highest ELA scores district-wide. That's you. - Okay. - All right. All right. And obviously we moved up your party a little bit because we also know this is a big weekend for you. And we wanted the opportunity to invite a special guest from out of town. - Oh my God, my baby's here. - Oh congratulations. Thank you. I'm going to be such a wreck before the wedding even starts. Look at this beautiful bride to be. Aww. I better speak quickly so we can get the kids back to work. - Yes. - But my God, for one time, I don't know what to say. My heart is full. (light music) - Of course the prayer is much longer in Hebrew. But in essence, what it says is blessed art thou oh Lord, our God, master of the universe, et cetera. And then Helena, you will come up and present Christina with your necklace. Oh, you can practice that. - Thank you, Rabbi. You look beautiful. So tall, so thin, so good for our gene pool. - Thank you. - And then I will circle behind you, I will put on this precious necklace. I will lean over to my boy and I will say, I love you, son, son, good luck. - Thank you, Helena. - So I'll just be standing here holding the stick. - You'll be holding up the pole of the huppah. (speaking in Spanish) And then the Christina, you will circle Robert seven times to the left. Practice, go ahead. (light music) - And what's all this with the necklace. Is that a Jewish thing too? - All the women in Bobby's family wear that necklace on their wedding day. - And did Art use it for his next two wives after Helena? You told me a rabbi and a priest were officiating. (speaks in Spanish). - I explained all this three times in an email. - Yes, and I said I wanted to talk with you about it. Why didn't you call me? (speaks in Spanish). - Stop, stop, stop. I don't wanna have this conversation right now. - When then, because I really wanna speak with you. - Can we have dinner? I'll come to the hotel afterwards and we can go for a walk. I'm just excited for us all to sit together now and just celebrate. Mom? (clinking) - Bobby, your family has been wonderful and welcoming and your father Art and Gemma. So kind of you to host this dinner. And of course, thank you, Helena. I know my baby's very loved. I was watching Christina practicing the circling with Rabbi Winthrop. - Weinthrob. - I'm sorry, Weinthrob. And I could see her passing when she was a little girl running around my school and I could also see her again in my school. When was this? Five years ago? She had just graduated from law school and I had her come to speak to my students, wearing her cap and gown. Christina told me she was moving to California. I said, what? California? Just a couple of years. That was the plan. Remember what I said? You might meet someone out there. Salud. - [All] Salud. (clinking) (light music) (speaking in Spanish). - Bobby, (speaks in Spanish), tax attorney with irritable bowel syndrome. - Huh. (speaks in Spanish) (knocking) - I heard you come in. I'm in the adjoining room. - Hi. I would like to invite you in, but I am supposed to meet Christina outside. We're going for a walk. - Oh lovely. It was a wonderful night. - Yes. Let me ask you something, Gloria. What do you think about my ex-husband's latest wife? - Jim? - Yeah. - Seems lovely. Lovely. Is she even 12? - Christina says you dabble in fortune telling. - Yeah, sometimes, but mainly it's just, just nonsense. Well, I'll let you go, have a good walk. If you can't sleep, knock. - Thank you, Helena. - Of course. (cell phone ringing) (light music) - [Christina] Hi, it's Christina. I can't take your call to please leave a message. - Christina. I've called you. Christina. I've left you two messages now, please let me know you're okay, please. (eerie music) I keep having this dream that there's a light coming out of my chest. Is that crazy? Maybe my subconscious know something I don't, like maybe it's related to this problem. - Well, I wouldn't call it a problem. Your blood work looks good. TSH is up a bit. Your ultrasound did show one of your nodules has gotten slightly bigger. It's most likely nothing, but I'd like to schedule a biopsy. - My daughter's wedding is coming up. - We'll have the results quickly. It's likely we just need to change your prescription. - I know how this goes. I've been through it before. - I remember, but you don't know how it's going to go. Well, I do know something's wrong, and I don't know what I should tell Christina. - Can I share something with you? I dream about baseball, every night, just hitting the ball to the left side of the infield and running around the bases. And I never get to home plate. I just keep hitting it to third base and running. Why the left side of the field? I don't know. I haven't picked up a bat in 30 years. It doesn't make any sense, but every night there I am running the bases. (light music) - Excuse me. Good morning. - Thanks. There's no parent coordinator on the east door. Vicky's already heading down there. You ready for your big weekend? - I'm going to keep power walking until I can fit into that dress. Another parent tour. Yes. (speaks in Spanish). - Yeah. Pesculi's got that one. So there was another incident in the bathroom. More drawings. Holly's on his way there now. Okay, I think we're gonna get- - I didn't do it. - I believe you, go back in there and wash your hands. - I already did. - Then go to class. - Reminds me of Carlos. - Rodriguez. - Yeah. - Not as bad. Tell the teachers to check their bathroom logs and to send me a list of boys who went to the bathroom between eight and 9:00 a.m. I promise you it was not me. - Excuse me. Excuse me? Can I help with? - Yes, please. With Christina. - That's my daughter's name. Let's take a walk, Christina Did your class make these? - Yeah. Which one is yours? - This one. How did you think of your story? - My family goes to the beach a lot and I was the only kid who didn't know how to swim and everybody else knew how to swim. So when I finally learned I- (light music) Mommy? (speaking in Spanish) - You're analyzing poetry and writing plays and even learning Latin. I can't give you that here. All I do is test, test, test. (speaks in Spanish) Someday you will (speaking in Spanish) Hush. Someday you will be a poet or a doctor. Anything you want, we're pioneers, we're doing things in our family no one has ever done. Be proud. Okay? - Vika's here, she'll take you on the train up to your school. (speaking in Spanish). - Oh, we have Roberto from Mrs. Earl's class joining this morning. - Wonderful. Good morning. My special guest for morning announcements is Roberto from Miss Earl's class. What is this you're showing us. - It's my all about sharks piece. - Good, now you are building a story. I think we need another volunteer. What's your character's name? - Me? - Yeah. - Richard. - No, no. Now not your real name. Your character's name? - Richard. - Okay. Good. Good. Now how does your character walk? Come on up. Yeah, well. - Yeah, come on. - Oh yeah, okay. Midgard, he walks with a smile. - Ooh. - Yeah, I used to be six feet, but now I think I've shrunk an inch or two. In fact, I'm afraid to measure myself. - Ooh. See, now that's good because now we know a secret. You are afraid to measure yourself. So when was the first time that you started to thank you were shrinking? - Ah, yeah, that happened when I first started working here. - Oh. - Yeah. And when I first met Miss Hernandez, I mean Miss Smir Hernandez. Right? - That's right. - I'm just observing here. - So when I showed up the first day I started shrinking. - Here comes Miss Smir Hernandez. - Shrinking, huh? - Yep, I was just that day- - Shrinking. - Mm. Yep. - The first thing you need to know, if you want to work here is you need a calendar. Anything that needs to happen goes on the calendar. Otherwise everything gets away and nothing gets done. Parent workshops, you put it on the calendar, teacher evaluations on the calendar. You don't want your mailbox overflowing. You want to know when you're going to answer them. Put that time. - [All] On the calendar. - Time to eat. - [All] On the calendar. - Well, when do we go home? - Home, we sleep on the desks. - What do I tell my wife. - To bring us sleeping bag. - Excellent. Okay. Let's line up over here so we can do the next character exercise. (speaking in Spanish) - Did you know that Tina keeps a journal? Is that something most people do? - I don't know. - Do you? - No. Are you eating? - I was cleaning out our bedroom, you know, for the new flooring and I grabbed a bunch of books and it just, it fell and flipped open. I didn't even realized what it was at first, you know? And it was mostly about our kids. Yeah, but the weird thing is, she didn't even mention me. I just, I stopped reading about her and just started looking for a little clue about me. - Why are you telling me this? - Have you heard anything from the superintendent yet? - No. - Hey. Remember that we have the vote for the Student Honor Society. - What? - Surprise! (all applaud) - And obviously we moved up the party a little bit because this is a very special weekend for you. Andy gave us the opportunity to invite a special guest from out of town. - Oh my God. (all cheer) My baby's here. - Surprise. - I, when I began here. It's true. We're supposed to be shut down. We sometimes had police in the building, running down the halls, right? I think about that a lot. I wasn't even certified yet to be a principal. I was taking classes on the weekends. So I cleaned houses. We had to pay for it. I used to leave Christina with a babysitter who I think only spoke Polish. On those nights, coming home from Manhattan. I'd be trying to write plans. But the progress here was so slow and I'd be thinking on the train. It is so hard to love other people's children as much as you love your own. (light music) I was watching Christina practicing the circling. It was very evocative. I could see her, when she was a little girl, she'd make a new friend. She'd load up this red wagon we got her and put all her favorite toys on it and drag them over to her friend's house and give them all to her friend. It happened a few times. She dragged this wagon onto the subway all the way up to Park Avenue. Imagine the parents probably worried we had bed bugs. I can see her now dragging that little red wagon. - I could get her a red SUV if it would help. - Hilarious, Sandro. - I'm just saying. - Just hilarious. - Generous bride. Lucky us, here's to them. The happy couple. - The happy couple. (clinking) (light music) (cell phone rings) - [Christina] Hi, it's Christina. I can't take your call. - Christina, it's mom. Please call me. - Hey, what is that? - Hey, stop. Hey, hey, hey. (light music) (knocking) Do you have anything that can help me sleep? - Just one. Gloria, I wanna tell you something. When I was getting ready to marry Arthur, my mother tells me that her mother had a necklace with a different diamond on it for every generation of our family going back hundreds, hundreds of years, our people were furriers. They had money. The necklace she tells me is like looking into a kaleidoscope. It holds the history of my entire family. So many carats. Here. Just breathe this in normal. - Oh no, no. - You won't regret it. (coughs) Good. Good. My grandmother, the one with a necklace. Gassed at Auschwitz, whole side of my family gone. And those diamonds, who the hell knows who's wearing them now. And my mother tells me this, the night before my wedding, and then she hands me this. All of the life, my mother Lily put away money bit by bit. So that for my wedding, she could buy me this. Go ahead. You open it. I only wish to God she were here to see Christina wear it. And tomorrow I will add another diamond to it for Christina. I know it's a little bit much, but that's my taste. And someday she will give this to her granddaughter. And if somebody takes it, we start again. You know, when I had cancer and they had to operate, I decided great. I'm gonna get new breasts and they're gonna be better than ever. Who's that man who keeps rolling the same Boulder up the hill? - I don't know. - Well, just keep, I just keep rolling my boulder. And I've got my dignity. Sound familiar? - Oh, whoa. No, no, no. - Just sit. Just sit. Just sit. Just sit. Just sit, sit, sit. You're okay. - I'm just. - Dizzy. - It's all right. That's alright. Gloria. I think you're searching for something. - I just wanna talk to Christina. - Do you know what you would say to her? Okay. It's okay. It's okay. Listen to me. My mother taught me how to do this when I was a little, little girl, I cannot remember a time when I could not read palms. Trust me. Close your eyes. Really, do it. Let everything go black. Now where we go. (light music) That's right. Now breathe. Someone is writing on the walls of your memory. The words are in Spanish. I can't greet them. - Morning. - There's no bearing coordinator on the east door. - Vicky's heading down there right now. Wait. There's been some vandalism. (knocking) - I didn't do it. - Go back to class. Go. Tell the teachers to check their bathroom logs and to send me a list of boys who went to the bathroom between eight and nine and check their hands for ink. What are they doing? - I don't know. One of their parents must have called them. - Excuse me. Please wait in my office. Hello? Where are they going? - It's not just in the bathroom. It's everywhere. - What are you doing? Get back to class now. - Let's go. Come on, go, go. Get to class. Your doctor's office keeps calling. - Not right now. - And Roberto from Mrs. Earl's class is in your office is waiting to do morning arch. - Can you handle that, please? - Handle it. - We've been working together for 15 years in the next two weeks you'll be the principal, act like it. - Okay. (speaking in Spanish) - Good, that's good. Now you're building memories for your character. Great. Now who's next. - [All] Me, me, me. - Mom? - Christine. I'm sorry. We had an emergency here. - I wrote the play for you and you didn't even come. - Well, tell me about it now. - No. - Well, wait, we wait. Look at me, honey. Look at me. What was it about? - About a mommy who has a light coming out of her chest. - Told you I didn't do it. - Found the boy responsible for the vandalism. - Let go of me now, let go of me. - Relax. Relax. - Excuse me. Let him go. We don't have these problems here anymore. - Ma'am did you look at his hands? - He's only 13. Please let him go. Get these handcuffs off of him. Let him go. Christina, wait for me here. Christina? Christina? Back inside, back inside, get back into your classroom. Back to your class. Back to class now. Now. - Christina? Christina? Don't do that. Don't touch the armor, go to class now. (light music) - [Christina] Mom. - Christina, Christina. - Mom, graduation was last week. Do I really have to wear this? - Yes. I want the students to know what someone who graduates from law school looks like, look how beautiful you are. - Mom, stop. I've been putting this off all week. So I'm just gonna say it. I took a job in California. - California. - They offered a lot of money, way more than anyone else. And you know how many student loans I have? I'll go out for a couple of years and I'll pay off my loans and then I'll come back. - What if you meet someone out there? - That's not gonna happen. - Why do you say that? - Because I know guys aren't exactly knocking down my door. I mean, look at me. - I am looking. - Yeah, I sound like one thing and I look like another, can't figure myself out. I'm tired of trying to be someone I'm not. Besides, I like California, it's like a chance for me to start over again. - You never mentioned you were unhappy. - Mom. - You did everything you had to do. I know how lucky I am. - It's just hard disappointing you. - Hey. Hey. Hey. Hey. - Remember we have the vote for Student Honor Society. - What? - Surprise! (all applaud) - Where's Christina? Where's Christina I'm feeling disoriented. I feel like my heart's skipping beats. - I didn't hear any irregularities in your heartbeat and your blood work is fine. TSH is up a bit though. And your ultrasound did show one of your nodules has gotten bigger. It's probably nothing, but I'd like to schedule a biopsy. - I know how this goes, I've been through it before. - I remember, but with Victor it was an MRI. A lot of times spots can show up on x-rays just if you move around a little bit when the picture's being taken, but I'd like to schedule an MRI just to rule out a few things. - What kinds of things to rule out? (speaking in Spanish) - Victor and I had many good times. Most of them, I wish I had a camera, but you can't stop to grab it. You have to remember it all, the feeling, the warmth of it. I think if we have enough of those moments, maybe they burn in, my mother was a woman of very few words. So when she spoke, you listened. The night before my wedding, she came in my room, sat in my bed and talked about marriage and my future. So later tonight, Christina, you and I will have a nice talk. It all comes around like the circle in your Jewish thing. I can see you pulling that wagon, honey, what I wish I could do, what I wish I could say to you then. There are so many things I would like to tell you, but I'm supposed to make it snappy because it's a total- (crash) Oh my God. What am I trying to say? I'm sorry. (light music) (cell phone rings) - [Christina] Hi, it's Christina. I can't take your call. Please leave a message. - Christina, could you please call me? - Can I make a prediction? I think I know how it's gonna go for you with your doctor. The growth will be benign, but they're gonna need to check you every six months again, again and again. And that may be hard. Like that, man, with a sword tied to one string forever hanging over his head. What's that guy's name, or whatever. And you'll ask me, am I gonna live with that? And I'll tell you that it takes time, and you'll say, but I don't have time. And I'll answer time is everything. (thud) (suspenseful music) - Christina? Christina? Christina? Christina? Christina? - Hush, hush. You're okay. You're okay. You're okay. You must have been sleep walking, it was the Ambien. It'll be morning soon. You should finish your dream. (suspenseful music) Hush, hush. (speaking in Spanish) - Oh. Look at you. Oh my God. So beautiful. - You know, we're working on it. I'm sorry I didn't come out. I was mad, I didn't wanna take it out on you. - It's fine. - So what did you wanna talk to me about? (sighs) (light music) - It's all good. I never meant to drive you away. I just, I'm sorry I haven't always been there for you. - [Christina] You're always with me. - I just love you. You're my light. Be happy. (melancholy music) Be happy. (light music)
