We'd better run. Freeze. Hold it there. - Inspector. - Status? We've got 3 robbers, but one's still inside with a hostage. Call 2020 and 2021, I want them here. Yes. - Evacuate the place. - Yes. Inspector. Go away. Report to Ming's Supermarket right away, over. Don't you dare dating us again. Roger, we're on our way, over. - Roger, over. - Well? They're coming. Give it to me. Where have you been? Fighting crimes. Come here right away. What happened? Chiu performed a car stunt. Where are you? We're heading east, will be there any minute. East, west. I told you to be easy with the hand brake. Now we're in trouble. We'll have a new car. What about the car? The government will send you a bill. What case have we got? Robbery and hostage keeping. That's serious. Are these the heavies? All have moustaches, your turn. What's your name? Black dog. And the one inside? Monkey. Tell them to take their clothes off. Yes. Take your pantyhose off. What? we need them, hurry up please. This one's cleaner. Don't put real bullets in. Don't worry. Freeze or I'll shoot you. You're strangling me to death anyway. Monkey. Who's that? Black dog. You've got one too? I killed two outside. They now know we mean business. They wouldn't try anything. Don't go crazy killing people. We've got to show them we mean business. What should we do now? Go out with the hostages. Before more cops arrive. Freeze. It hurts. Shut up, you're dead. Don't kill anymore. Why not? Shut up or I'll kill you. Shut up. You're so heavy. You killed all the hostages. Do the cops know your face? No. You play hostage, I'll take you out. Good. I'm out of bullets, give me your gun. Here. Let's go. More acting. Don't come near or I'll kill him. More acting. Give us a car. A car? Get in. Freeze. Bye. You. Wake up, miss. Mouth to mouth? I've no other choices. What happened now? She woke up and passed out again. Get an ambulance. Morning, everybody, breakfast time. Your day will come soon. You devil. Hello. Chiu, a call for you. Thanks. Hello, who's that? Hold on. Beethoven, it's for you. Thanks. Hello. How stupid of me. What do you think you're doing? Sorry, sir. It'd better not be green. I've got it all over my head. Thank you. You took the last can. One has to be quick. Smart guy. I'll take care of it. Thank you. Where's my report? I gave it to Beethoven. You didn't. He's holding it. Sorry, I didn't know it's your report. Freeze. What do you mean? Stand still. Don't you tease me. You dared giving a cop order. He told you to stand still. - You idiot. - Sir. You want to play games? Put your gun down. Let go of me. I'll kill him. It's not my fault. They're all on your side. Otherwise I'd shoot you. You asked for it. What's bugging you today? Get back to work. What about the report? Get someone to retype it. You'd like to have me deaf? Hello. Are you dumb or something? Pumpkin head, the paint's still wet. Why me again? Because you're such a blockhead. Are you drinking it or not? Of course I am. You want it? Tough guy. That'll teach you. I've to give these to the Iron Lady. Iron Lady? Inspector Chen's new secretary? That's right. You're in trouble. I know how to handle women. Just flatter them. She's tough case though. You know why they call her Iron Lady? No. Because she's the meanest woman on earth. When she stationed at downtown. Don't interrupt. Carry on. They said she's nasty. They all hated her. Do you know why? No. Because they were jealous of her. She's actually very efficient. Intelligent, pretty. And full of hearts. Morning, Madam. Morning. Morning. Your reports to Inspector Chen, should be handed to me. Don't forget to date them. And make copies for Public Relations. Yes. Trying to make fun of me? Look at these smart eyes. The madam's back. He's not afraid of her. That's right. Who gives a damn about that nasty broad? I was practicing my lying techniques. You did well. Chiang, where's your report? It's not finished yet. You'd better be more punctual or I'll have to report it. Get it done. Why are you crying? I'm not crying. You've done stupid things before. First time today though. Let's go. - Morning. - Morning. A black ceiling? Are you color blind? Who'll buy us dinner tonight? Our pimp informer. He's meeting us at the usual place. Beethoven, Chiu. Mr. Sha's making a deal in the Paris Room. You're not lying, are you? Of course not. For your sake you'd better not be. - Freeze. - Nobody moves. Stand up. Your four, move over to the wall. Move it. Move it. Stand still. Don't move. - You... - Shut up. You have the right to remain silent. Now that I've read you your rights. I'm charging you with drug trafficking. What have you got? Underwear's. Do they fit you? Be serious. What now? It's time to go. Sorry everybody. Hold it. You pulled your guns on us. And accused us of drug trafficking. It's a misunderstanding. We'll buy you a new briefcase. That simple? Are you real cops? Let me see your I.D. Our guns prove our identities. Robbers have guns too. Show me your I.D.s or I'll call the police. I'll file a complaint. That you abused your authorities. You'll hear from our lawyer. Now leave us alone. He pissed me off. Me too. I'm a cop, I'm after illegal aliens. I want to see your I.D. Show me your I.D. I left it at home. What should we do with him? Take him back to the station. Wait. Mr. Sha is a celebrity, don't you recognize him? Do you recognize him? No. We can verify Mr. Sha's identity. The all say that. Should we go by the book? Is that resisting arrest? What do you think? Calm down. Go get my I.D. I'll do you a favour. I can hide your face with a paper bag. So you wouldn't make the headlines. Don't bother. Your men were way out of line. I was locked up for one night. The turtle's having difficulty breathing. You'd better do something. You... Shut up you two. We're going to sue them. They invaded our privacy. Why are turtles bald? They've done too many evil things. I told you two to shut up. You can complain to Public Relations. You'll hear from our lawyer. Good idea. Let's go. The turtle's eyes bulge. But I've fed him already. I think he's upset. Come on, move it. The turtle refuses to move. I'll get even. Don't upset yourself. You'd better stop playing around. Sorry sir. Don't mess with Sha. Put him away for good. I've always wanted to lock him up. He was locked up for one night. I want it to be for life. That's not nice. Be serious, get out. Sir. - Morning. - Morning. - Morning. - Morning. Aren't you going to apply? She may still be mad at me. Go apply for an apartment in the dormitory. I'm not up to it. I'll tell her first, then you talk to her. Stay here. Can I tell you something? Sure. Promise not to get mad though. Okay. Chiu's in love with you. But he's afraid of you. But to love is not a sin. He should tell you face to face, right? Right. I'll tell him to come in. But be nice to him. I told her. Don't you worry a thing. Madam. Sit down. Sit down. You want to have a family. You dream about it all the time. Is it true? Yes, I can't get it off my mind. I'll leave you two alone. It's time for you to settle down. I know. When did you start thinking this way? What way? To have a family. A long time ago. Why didn't you tell me? I was afraid. Of what? I don't have enough qualifications. What do you think you're lacking? I've been a cop for over 10 years. But I'm not even a sergeant. Ranks don't mean a thing. Do you know why I became a cop? No. Because I like to be with macho men. The type with guts. I... I'll give you a fighting chance. Thanks Madam. Call me Anna. I'll consider it. You mean... I'll let you know. Go now, we shouldn't be talking like this. Don't spoil it, see you later. Chiu, take care of yourself. I was only applying for an apartment? Tea. Coffee. Tea, coffee. Sure. - One ham sandwich. - Right Behave or I won't take you out anymore. Sorry. Don't worry about him. I'm taking him back to the nut house. What do you want to do? I've got to run. - Really? - Really. - Bye. - Bye Bye. Going for an Oscar? - You'll ask him. - Okay. Sandwich. Sandwich. Why didn't you ask him? Oh! Hotel. Which hotel? Huang. Pay at the counter. Coming. What would you like? Which hotel? Hush, sandwich. I ate it. Hush. Why? Don't expose my identity. There's nothing to be ashamed of. I'm a cop and he's an informer. He's going to tip us off. Just pretend we don't exist. Now you can tell me. Where's Pimp? Playing Mahjong at the Ritz Hotel. Hold it. What a hand. You'd better watch it. I'll make sure you can't win. You handle so many girls. Why don't you send some to my club? Your business is too slow. No way. What? Freeze, hands up. Chiu, Beethoven. I told you not to move. I can charge you with gambling. But I wouldn't do that. Take Pimp out for a walk. Come on. What about this hand? Just go. Move it. I'll play with you guys. Sit down. You lied to me. I didn't. You did too. Carry on with the game. Who tipped you off? I can't tell you. Yes you can. I haven't hit you yet. Come on. I want it. What took you so long? - "6 Bamboos". - I want it. I don't want it. You can't change your mind. - Hold it. - I want it. Sorry about that. Wait, do you want that? No. Are you sure? Absolutely. Can I continue? Go ahead. Come on, don't stall the game "White Dragon". I want it. May I? Sure, it worth's more money. You play much smarter than him. I won. What? Check it yourself. How much do I owe you? Six-forty. Peanuts. Six hundred and forty dollars. Not six dollars and forty cents? 100, 200... You won? No. Would Pimp have lied again? I don't think so. He used to be this broad's pimp. It's not locked. Lulu, we're the police. We're cops. Lulu. Forgive me. Is she dead? I think so. Sleeping pills. A naked corpse? An ugly sight? Imagine whatever you want. I don't feel excited anymore. Because you're not cold-blooded. Hello, headquarters? Boss. You killed her, but she hid my ledger. I thought she might go to the cops. She wouldn't do that. All she wanted was blackmail me. But if the cops got the ledger. We'd all be finished. She mailed a registered parcel. Must have been the ledger. Kitty? - Pai. - Yes? Kitty's her cousin in Macau, get her here. Sure. Tell everybody to hold off trading. Right. Sir. Sir. - Take a look inside. - Yes. Who discovered the body? I did. He didn't, I did. He did. What did this place look like? Was the TV set on? No. Were those drinks here? We brought these 3 cans. Judging from the temperature of the body. She died within the last 3 hours. The body has no bruises. She must have died from an overdose of pills. What kind of pills? Sleeping pills. I found this bottle near the bed. If she was murdered. Would this bottle have the fingerprints of the murderer? It would. How long have you been in the force? About 13 years. You must have forgotten what they taught you. You were having fun here. Leaving your fingerprints all over. We... You'd better explain to your supervisor. I want a report from him. Yes sir. Are you the Commissioner of Police? No. Maybe you are the Commissioner. Not yet. Then why were you meddling in the Chief Inspector's affairs? What about your own details? Have you finished them? Coffee, sir. Put it down. What would you two like? D.D.T. Stick to your own details. Maybe I should put you back in uniforms. You idiots. Sorry sir. Will 2 sugars do? Who did you think you were? They gave me hell. I've lost much face. They want a report from me. You tell me how to write it. What's that? The report, you dictated it What are you peeping at? - Nothing. - Get out of my office. Yes, sir. Wait, what are your names? Don't you know our names? I meant English names. Mine's Johnny. Mine's Walker. I'm naming you two Johnny and Walker. - Get out. - Yes. I won't let people bully you two. - I told you he'd give us the hell. - Chiu, come here. Turn around. White is my favourite colour. You have the same build as my brother. One should think before one act. Why didn't you come with me? I was busy. It's still painted black. You can't fool me this time. It didn't work. I've got another idea. I did great in Mahjong yesterday. I won $3,000, I'm such a good player. Columbo is showing off again, let's nail him. For how much? $500.00 Good. Are you paying me or not? What's the matter? He owes me money. Only $500. Don't get rough over $500. It's money just the same. None of your business anyway. Pay me back. I've got no money, leave us alone. Listen to me, calm down. Why should I listen to you? I only listen to money. I told you it's none of your business. I'll make it my business. Beethoven, pay him back. - You shouldn't. - Come on, pay him back. It's my business now. Don't borrow from me anymore. Don't borrow from him. Borrow from me. I will. $500 is all we can spend. I know. This way please. Thanks. Hi, pretty. You call that pretty? No, but one should be generous. What would you like to drink? Coffee. Orange juice. This is where Pimp hangs out lately? Don't you know that? I wish they had dance girls here. This is not a dance hall. Look at that. Make your move. She wouldn't like me. Come over in 28 seconds. You're a heartless person. You thought you're pretty. You bullied him around. What are you talking about? Look at him. He tried to kill himself because you were mean to him. You've got the wrong girl. Isn't she the prettiest here? I didn't see her just now. I didn't know a girl could be so pretty. Who's your girlfriend then? Over there. Are you kidding? How could one kill oneself for that? I'm not very good with women. You should be more selective. I know. Hi there. I'm Beethoven, He's Chiu. And you? I'm May, you must be real buddies. We went to the Academy together. What do you do for a living? We're... He's a scriptwriter, I'm a teacher. You're both intellectuals. Right. Good, I dislike unsophisticated men. We're not. I write novels. Really? I love novels. What tittles have you done? Well, my latest is... "Look at the wind". "Look at the wind"? It's about a man in love. And wind inspires him. How romantic. I want to read it. You may not like it, it's too sad. "Look at the wind..." "Who's talking to me?" "I thought I heard your voice," "so remote, so far away" "Is it the falling leaves," "or is it your voice, " "that makes me puzzled" "At this moment," Recite some more. I have to stop. Or I'll be in tears. This way please. You haven't done any tricks yet. But you've cost me $1,000 on drinks. That's terrible. What's that again? You said you loved me. Love comes after money. I'll find you some tricks. You'd better be nice to them. Okay. That's how the novel ends? Yes. It's so sad. And so romantic. Look over there. Why don't you take care of it? There's more. Really? I also wrote "Look at the Clouds" Tell me the story. You gave us bad tips. Please, not now. Why not? I know I owe you. You led us to find a body. What body? I didn't know they killed her. "I'm a cloud in the sky". May, it's late, you'd better go home. Tomorrow's a holiday. You owe me one. Where's Beethoven. Picking up a broad over there. They are discussing prices. You know her? Of course I do, she's Susi. What's her price? $500.00 And mine is $300. Wait here. "I remember the glamour of our encounter". Bill Hsu wrote that. Not Bill Hsu, Bill you. What? Go away please. Don't waste her time. Her price is $500. What? You'd better apologize. Pimp, come over here. Hi. Beethoven. Tell Beethoven the lady's name. Susi, I've got the wrong person. You two villains. You want to hear another poem? Chiu! Change tires. Pimp told you they murdered Lulu. - Yes. - He said Sha ordered it! Yes. He didn't know shy Sha did it. Yes. Sha has many minions. Yes. Yes. You weren't even listening to me. You were talking nonsense. Just find Scarman and we'll get the story. That spare tire's flat. Yes. Sorry. See who has a scar on his hip. Should we tell them to line up? Of course not. What's your problem? Sorry about that. What's up? - Sorry. - Nuts. He's crazy. Couldn't find one. Let's go to the pool. I should have brought my diving goggles. Do something. Like what? I'm thinking. Taking a leak here? I'm not. You mean you're... What the hell. That's filthy. Are you crazy? Cut the nonsense out. We were joking. You want to pick fight? I wouldn't dare disturbing the gentlemen here. - He's not here. - What then? We'll come back another day. That's him. Right. We've been looking for you. You'd better come with us. - Where did he go? - That way. They said the other way. They never cooperate with cops. Are you all right? Hey, man. That's too long. Get up. Aren't you hurting? We still have to get him. Let's split up. No, two men are stronger than one. You're right. Let's go. Come. Excuse me... He jumped down. Who? He. From where? From here. I wonder why he did it. He didn't want to do it. I opened the window and knocked him down. We'd better run. Come here. What's up? - Counterfeits. - Counterfeits? - Looks just like real. - Right. Be careful with it. Dirty my clothes and I'll shoot you. Sorry sir. Over there. You look great today. Do you have $500? Another loan? No. I told you he wouldn't have it. I can't pay him back then. Of course I have $500. Give me the $1,000 bill. Where's your $500? Don't you trust me? I've only got $493.5 You can keep the difference as interest. No, I'll give it to you tomorrow. Sign your name. I gave the counterfeit to Columbo. Columbo, give me $1,000. Be polite if you want a loan. That counterfeit is court exhibit. Counterfeit? No kidding. Don't waste my time. Chiu. Look for Beethoven, not me. You son of bitch. He pulled his gun again. That's his routine. He won't shoot. Get back to work. D, E, A, R. No need to look it up. Dear means darling, it's from Anna. None of your business. Don't pick on me. The card's message may be brief. It's worth thousands of words to me. This is my happiest birthday. Because I feel... The air is filled with your presence. Stupid lines, aren't they? I saw it on TV last night. It depends on who delivers them. It depends on who says them. Thanks for your card. What card? The birthday card. You read it? Yours is the only one. - Really? - Really Only 3 persons have ever given me birthday presents. Are they men or women? All women. My grandmother gave me a kiss when I was 3. My mother gave me an apron when I was 29. She knew I'd have to cook myself. Today you gave me a card. You've been cooking for yourself? No, I've been eating out. What about tonight? I'll buy you dinner. Good. Where would you like to go? Your place. My place? What's wrong? Nothing. Happy birthday. I've bought you a present. I've got to send him away. Happy birthday. I'm feeling awful. Are you sick? Don't play around. I should be contented. I have a nice job and good friend. But I still feel very lonely. You mean you're horny. I'm in no mood for jokes. Sorry. I just want to be left alone. So I can think about my future. What do you mean? You can stay here if you want. I'll go to a hotel. You're not lonely, you're horny. I'm not in the mood for jokes. What's wrong with you? Just leave me alone. Beethoven. I'm sorry, it's not my day. My blues won't go away till dawn. Stay away until tomorrow. He's just too horny. You're late. I had to find what you wanted. And the present? I've got it, a pink one. Is she good? Is your friend good? Calm yourself, it's Chiu's birthday. I couldn't care less. 2nd floor, Apartment A. Why is she like that? She was drunk when I found her. Chiu will like her. Open up or I'll leave. The party hasn't started yet. Nice atmosphere. Where's the bathroom? Over there. Anna. Call me anything you want. Who's she? Why aren't the lights on? Power's been cut off. Relax. Happy birthday. Thanks for your present. That's a lot of groceries. Where's the kitchen? Take care of my bag. Okay. You can open this door. Where did she go? What's wrong? Nothing. Just getting you an apron. Thanks. - Thanks. - I'll leave you alone. Chiu. Is Beethoven coming back for dinner? No. What are doing? Practicing my dancing. You must be warm. No, I feel quite cool. Do you have any eggs? They are in the refrigerator. There's nothing in there. Beethoven ate everything up. Nothing up there either. You bachelors. Chiu. Do the eggs for me. Sure. Nice decorations. Thank you. Something's burning. Really? It smells really bad. I haven't even started cooking. Go away. Who's that with a beard? My grandfather. And the one below him? My father, next to him is my mother. What's wrong? I miss them so much. My mother died giving birth to me. The others died before I was born. I always miss them on my birthdays. I'm Sorry, I didn't know that. Don't say any more. Let bygones be bygones. You should celebrate your birthday. I'll fry you some eggs. I need one more egg. I forgot to tell you one thing. I'm a very restless person. 1, 2, 3, forget it. I'll get you an egg. Go in first. You need any help? Please don't die, I'll warm you up. I'm getting very warm now. Please don't die. Chiu. Chiu. Coming. What are doing? What's up? Can't you hear the phone ringing? Oh yes. Hello. Beethoven here, feeling better? You're ruining my night. I'm having Anna over for dinner. Has Anna seen her? Not yet, you'd better do something. Chiu. It'll be too late anyway. I've got something in my eyes. No, it won't be too late. Let me help you. It's cold. - What's that? - My singing. Happy birthday to me. I'll take you to the basin. Let me wash the towel. I can do that. Okay. Chiu. Chilly, isn't it? Why are you so excited? This is the first time in my life. A present and a date on my birthday. What's wrong? Nothing, you'd better take a break. We can't stay in the bathroom forever. Right. Oh my God. I didn't know you're here. We'll go somewhere. Where? What a close shave. What? Nothing. What's that? Bastard. It's over. They took away our office. And gave it to another department. According to the autopsy report. Your cousin had an overdose of sleeping pills. We found this bottle by her bed. She wouldn't have felt the pain. When did she die? Morning of the 18th. You're from Macau? Yes. My men will take your statement. Hurry, we're late. Inspector. Inspector. Why are you late? He helped a blind woman to cross the road. I couldn't resist. Go take the girl's statement. What case is it? She was raped by her stepfather. That's sick. Thanks for explaining everything to Anna. That's what friends are for. Exactly. Nice room. Why don't you take her statement? It'd be a pleasure. No, let me do it. Don't mention step-father and rape. She may be embarrassed. Okay. We're to take your statement. You should stop feeling upset. You've got to live on. I may still cry but I'm fine. One had to go through that anyway. At least it wasn't painful. I'm glad you can think that way. Did you two get along? We're very fond of each other. We used to play together. And we shared the same bed. No wonder. Where did your mother sleep? In the same room, our flat was small. Your family sure weren't conservative. My mother didn't mind. What's wrong? Too much for me. Are you all right? He does that sometimes. What were you doing when it started? I was sleeping. Did you wake up? No, I slept till dawn. Then I found out. You didn't wake up, how did you find out? My classmate told me. Do you live with her too? Yes, I live in the dormitory. That's really incredible. What do you mean? Nothing, maybe I'm too conservative. Too much for you? Yes. Didn't your classmate try to help you? Yes, she was handling me napkins. What? I was crying. Where can we find your...? In the morgue. Why? That's where dead people go. Are you pleased? How could you say that? The deceased's such a sick maniac. Don't you badmouth the deceased. Calm down, this is a free world. She shouldn't have filed a complaint. She can marry him. What are you talking about? I'm not sure I know. Me neither. Morning sir. What are you two doing here? Taking her statement. What statement? This lady was raped by her stepfather. What? I knew you two were inefficient. I didn't know you were so dumb. Go out and look at the door sign. Yes sir. We went to the wrong room. No wonder he gave us hell. Come back. - Sir. - Report this to your supervisor. I want a report from him. - Yes sir. - Go. Sorry, Miss. We'll arrest your stepfather. Where does he usually hang out? The Mahjong parlours. Does he have a nickname? Butch. Just sign here. You'd better wear a hat. Thanks. What took you so long? Chen wants you to handle this. I'm not in the mood. Me neither. You're never in the mood. Morning. Woke up late? I've got no one to wake me up. That's a problem. It won't last for long. Poor me, I've got nobody. I'll find you a girl. I know just right girl. Forgive me, I thought you're raped. But you do look like a rape victim. You're so pretty. You... That's what those lines would bring you. What should I say then? You should... I'm sorry about what happened. Don't worry about it. Beethoven does worry about it. He'd feel guilty for the rest of his life. Really? He once forgot to pay a debt of $5. He almost committed suicide. Don't stretch too far. You should let him buy you lunch. Then he'd feel better. Yes, let me buy you lunch. - Thank you. - You are welcome. It's pretty here. A lot of lovers come here. She's got a date, and he's rich. You'll be disappointed. Money has nothing to do with love. What are you talking about? I envy those rich playboys. They change girlfriends all the time. Mr. Chou's not playboy, he's a career man. Maybe all he does is sign cheques. Fools around with secretary. He's got a wealthy father. Lulu said he used to be very poor. He worked hard to have his own company. Then he must be quite an old man. No, he's in his late twenties. How many of you? - Four. - This way please. I don't think you stand a chance. You have to attend Lulu's funeral. Have you got a place to stay? I'll stay with Mr. Chou. I didn't say a word. You'd better be careful. I know. I have to go to the restroom. You want me to come with you? What's that? Forget it. Don't laugh, do something. The odds are all against you. You'd better pray for a miracle. Hi, Kitty. Mr. Chou. You're much prettier than your cousin. Lulu. Let bygones be bygones, be tough. I'll take care of you. Thanks. Did Lulu mail you a ledger? She sure did. It's mine, I told her to mail it to you. I see. Where is it now? In the car. Let's have lunch first. I think you should forget it. The competition's too strong. I think you're right. I'm used to losing anyway. At least you accept failures gracefully. I have to. Wait a minute. You can stay with me. Let's sit here. I've got two friends over there. Come with me. This is Beethoven, and this is Chiu. This is Mr. Chou. I heard you're a big man. Not at all. Please sit down. So Kitty will be staying with you? Who said that? You told me on the phone. I don't think so. You must be a hospitable man. It'd be good for Kitty to stay with you. Kitty can't stay with me. What's wrong. You'd better make up your mind. Why can't Kitty stay with you? Tell her. I... Well? Tell her. I'm a pimp, I run a whorehouse. That's why you can't stay with me. I didn't know he was a pimp. Fortunately you ran into Beethoven. Where can I stay? Are you ready to order? We're waiting for someone. Aren't you warm? No. It's really noisy here. I'll tell them to quiet down. Don't, we don't know them. I don't want any trouble. We don't have confront them ourselves. Miss, please tell the people next door. To lower their voices. We can't do that to our customers. Show this to them. Tell them that I'm entertaining my friends. I'd much appreciate it. If they lowered their voices. That's not nice. Don't worry. People are too rude, they need to be warned. I don't usually abuse my authority. But sometimes I have to. Did they give you a hard time? No, but they took your I.D. What else? They want you over there. Don't try to calm me down. We're not trying. I'm so mad. What made you so mad? Don't look back. It's you guys, we'll see you later. Don't be so anti-social. That's right. My colleagues. Nice to meet your pretty girlfriend. - This is... - Let me. This is 24, 28, and 35. Don't you know our names? I know your numbers better. What's your number? This is Kitty. I'm Pumpkin Head. I'm Nicotine. I'm Columbo. Beethoven gave us those names. Nice to meet you. Leave us alone. Go back over there. Why are you doing this to us? You despise us or something? Beethoven doesn't usually despise anyone. Not even hookers. Why don't you guys join us? Sit down. Sit down. Sit down. Kitty, you're a lucky lady. Beethoven may be short on look. But he's a sweet man. He lends me money all the time. Beethoven, I'd like... Not enough. How much do you want? Interest? Would these be counterfeits? You guys are funny. Beethoven's a playboy. One of our girls went out with him. She said he's a smooth dealer. Beethoven is a lady-killer. And why not? Beethoven's flushing. Order whatever you like. Let's order some food. I told you he's a sweet man. Thanks. Oh my God. What's wrong? What's the big deal? An old girlfriend? She. That's no big deal. What a coincidence. Hong Kong is a small place. What's your number? You have 1,000 girls at your club? More than that. Where do you work? Downtown. No wonder. Look at her. She looks quite good at her age. With that many years. You must be rich by now. When did you start tricking? You must be rich too. No, I spend it on men. Come on. These men? Sure, they're not bad. They've also got guns. Are you guys on duty? So what? They always come to our club. And take us out to dinner. What's wrong with you? They look like missing girls to me. You should know what to do. We'll take them to the station. Go right ahead. I'll come later for your report. Yes, madam. Come on. What have done? Big mouthing. Bye. This is Kitty. This is... Anna Sit down Anna, I can't live without you. Your turn. I had a great evening. Should I come with you? No, look after Beethoven. Make sure he behaves. Good night. Let's go to bed. Sure. Good night. Good night. Aren't you sleeping inside? I'm not a sex maniac. She seems to like you a lot. Every woman likes me. She doesn't know how I feel though. Why don't you tell her? How? Should I knock on the door? And tell her, "I love you"? I'm too arrogant for that. She may tell you to beat it anyway. Pretend you're dreaming. What? Then you can say anything. If she didn't like it, pretend you didn't know. That's a hell of an idea. But that's cheating. You can't fool me. I bet you'd use this trick. I've fallen in love with you. Maybe it's love at first sight. But I wouldn't dare telling you. I would only tell the stars. I wish you were the stars. And you would know I love you. Tell me I should talk to you. I love you, that's not a sin. Is he like this all the time? Yes. He pours his heart out at night. Don't leave me. Poor kid. Do you like him? Please tell him. No matter what happens, we'll still be good friends. What are my chances? Very little. What should I do? Go to sleep. I can't. Should I help you? Please. You asked for it. I don't know where the ledger is. Lulu wanted me to betray you. I refused, I don't know a thing. Should I believe him? I don't know. He passed out. Then he can't talk, throw him down. Right. Please don't, I'm still conscious. Throw him down anyway. I don't have the ledger. Lulu has a cousin in Macau. Where's she now? Staying with the two cops. Hello? This is Pimp. What's up? Come to Villa Restaurant now. All right. Pimp wants to tip us off. Go to see him yourself. Go. See you then. Only Chiu came down. Beethoven's still up there. Bring him up there. He must have forgotten something. Beethoven. Didn't you just call Chiu? - I did. - So? What do you want? Where's the ledger? - What ledger? - Where's it? It's in the bedroom. Go. Go. What ledger? One that'd put Sha in jail. You hit me, and hard. It hurts. It feels funny. I don't mind you hit me. But you can't touch my hair. What a teaser. Where's the ledger? In the closet. Freeze, or I'll shoot. Bill. Don't move, drop your weapons. Drop your weapons. Don't worry, I've nailed them. Give me the ledger. Come on. I threw it into the garbage truck. You threw it into the garbage truck? Do you know what that means? You threw away our chance of getting a promotion. That ledger's put Sha in jail. How could you do such a thing? I was almost killed by these guys. Where are they? Have you finished? What ledger is that? It's incriminating evidence against Sha. Go chase them. I'll be back soon. Be careful. I'm up here, stop the car. Beethoven. I'm here. Get up here. You knocked me down. Come on. You should have looked out for me. Come on, you're not a child. Pull over. What now? I lost my gun. Forget it, I've still got mine. Get in. Don't get nervous, take it slowly. Move it away. Take your time. I only took a nap. And you're gone off the road. Nail them. There it is. Which one do we want? I'll get the one in front. I can't catch up with that truck. I've got an idea. My feet! My feet are killing me. Damn it. I'm a cop. Please catch up with that truck. Not this one. Where did the other garbage truck go? What are you doing? I'm doing a dangerous stunt. I'm a cop, tell me. It went back to headquarters. There's a bomb in your car. A bomb! Run. Freeze. Freeze or I'll shoot. One more move, and I'll shoot you. You don't have any bullets. Pei. Hurry. The ledger's in this truck. Are you all right? Yes Don't let him get away with the ledger. Give me the ledger. Don't you have it? I was trying to con them. Then it's still in this truck. This truck is empty. Burn the garbage. Turn the water on. Beethoven, you're great. Thank you. An accident. I wonder what happened. Must be cops and robbers. What's up? Sha's trying to burn his ledger. Which contains incriminating evidence. Salvage the ledger. Yes sir. Go look for the ledger. Hurry. They don't know what it looks like. But I do, let me look for it. Don't bother. I'm taking over this case. There goes our promotion. We found it. Bring them all to the station. Yes sir. Sir. Why did you call him? I was calling Chen, he answered the phone. Now he'll get a promotion. And we're got nothing. Don't worry, our day will come. They beat me up though. You don't get beat up everyday. What? Don't.
