What defines this city is the bustle and noise, but now for the first time, I hear only birds in the streets, and it's barely spring. Social distancing guidelines. It felt like I was leaving my past behind. Leaving the city where I'd grown up and gotten married and raised a kid. Leaving for a new reality. I knew we had to get out of town. We were lucky to have a place to go. Sam and Karen, they weren't ready to leave. But I knew it was time. 20 seconds washing your hands. Two weeks for quarantine. Ten days to break a fever. Who comes up with these numbers? I went through it over and over in my mind. How did it catch me? How'd I slip up? Like a game of tag gone wrong. I didn't wanna tell Karen and Sam. Felt like admitting defeat. Admitting I'd screwed up. Let it get me. I felt so alone. Ashamed. My world was getting smaller and smaller. Once it was the whole city, and then the house. Now the bedroom. But mine was just one story among many. In my isolation, I thought about the city struggling to contain the outbreak. How many individuals were afflicted? Every one of us now alone. It came on fast, taking over my mind like a malignant fog, heating my body from the inside, choking me and crushing me. I was so weak, I was like a child again. Time lost its meaning. Had it been days or weeks, or only minutes? It seemed my whole life up to this moment had been a fleeting dream, and now I was awake in a nightmare. I had to stop them. Maybe I wanted to protect them. That's when I realized what I had to do to keep them from getting infected. The whole world turned upside down, turning in on itself. Things fall apart. The center cannot hold. They say the darkest hour is before the dawn, and the fever took me there like it brought a whole city to its knees, but if you're lucky, you can find the light. Sometimes just a reminder that you're not alone is enough, and as for me, I'll go out with a song. And that's okay. Hello. This is day whatever of quarantine, "lockdown" going on. Been on house arrest for a while, and thanks to my new best friend here, I can't even go 50 feet outside my own front door anymore without the Gestapo nailing my ass. Yeah, it's fucking fascism, dude. That's what it is. I mean, it's not like they can shut me up forever, though, you know? It's all out there. People just gotta connect the goddamn dots. Yeah, I know, right? Hey, listen. While I've got you on the phone, I was wondering if maybe you could post my video. I know that's a big ask, but I just feel like right now would be a good time to get my side of the story out there. Give people an opportunity to figure out the truth for themselves, you know? Come on, man. Please do this for me. I'm on house arrest. Just put it on your page! Why not? Oh, dude, don't even give me that bullshit. If you're really so scared of what other people think... Never mind. No, fuck you, too. Because of that, I decided to actually write a song about it. ♪ I have the truth ♪ Shut up, asshole. As the death toll in urban areas continues to spike, New York City has again become a hotbed for the virus, causing many citizens to flee to their upstate homes. You don't know shit. And you wouldn't tell us if you did. 5G towers. They're all over the Southland, but should you be worried? The virus has now mutated in Florida. God is striking back at the sin. The first casualty of the pandemic was freedom. You're carrying the most dangerous virus of all. The truth. That's what you... Oh. Freedom. I know that you can hear me. Well, guess what? Fuck you, Big Brother. Fuck you! Ow. Chad. What the fuck? Can you hear me? Who's talking? Down here, Chad. Down where? Here. Oh! Who the fuck are you? Who I am isn't important, but that you can hear me, that could mean everything. You disrupted the signal, but I don't know how much time we have. They're beaming it at you right now to infect you. There's only one way to make it stop. Make it sto... We've gone to great lengths to make contact with you, because you've been asking the right questions. Are you ready for the answers? I must've hit my head really bad. Chad. Chad. I really wish you'd take this more seriously. Yeah, well, I would if I could, but I can't, because there's nobody there. Chad, listen to me. Listen, Chad. This is important. I can't hear you, because I'm not fucking crazy! Of course you're not. Your pulse and temperature are elevated, though. Are you feeling all right, Chad? No. I mean, yes. No, I'm fine. Are you, though? Actually, you're getting very sick, exactly as they want you to. I'm not getting sick. It's not a fucking plague. That's what they want you to believe. You know what? If you know so much about what's really going on, then why don't you just go ahead and lay it on me? Go ahead. Talk. Connect the dots, Chad. What if there really is a plague? What if the 5G towers are frying our DNA to produce the virus? That's fucking insane. Why would they even wanna do that? Simple. To weed out the weak and crash the economy, with everybody on lockdown to make their cleanup easier. And then like magic, there's a vaccine, and everyone's so happy to get it, they don't ask what's really in it. What's in it? The next stage of control. Microchip receivers to relay the 5G signal straight to our brains and control how we think, what we say and do and buy. Once all the other redundant, useless bottom feeders are gone... people like you, Chad. I'm not useless. That's right. You're not. You can still save yourself. That's it. I'm over this. Chad! I'm trying to help you, Chad. I'm trying to help you save people's lives. I don't know, man. Maybe you're right. I need a minute to think. You need to do this. I tried. But nobody cares. Even if they did, how do you get a bunch of people to get off of their asses and actually do something? I'm not talking about your YouTube channel. I'm talking about you taking direct action. What can I do? And how do you expect everybody to just believe this shit? It doesn't matter what you believe, Chad. When you short circuited the device, it alerted the people monitoring you. They'll be here soon, and they won't arrest you. You know too much. Any potential threat to their plan will be terminated with extreme prejudice. What the fuck? I'm not a threat. I didn't do anything wrong. Why didn't you tell me that before? I was afraid you wouldn't be ready for this, but I had to hope that when you heard it, you would do what any reasonable man would do to protect himself. Just tell me how to make it stop. The tower's how they're controlling us, Chad, culling the herd of the weak. They made a big mistake when they didn't lock you up or kill you because you know how to stop them. You're the only one. Light it, Chad. Light it, Chad. Do it! God! What am I doing? Having second thoughts, Chad? Stop thinking. Do something worthwhile for a change. Who are you? Someone who figured out how to make people get off their asses and so something. You're carrying the most dangerous virus of all, Chad: the truth. I just want you to spread it. What's the truth? Due to the high volume of calls, we ask that you call back at a later time. We apologize for the inconvenience. Fuck. So are you gonna kill me now? I dunno. Am I? These vigilante groups were cited storming up the Hollywood Hills with several reports of gunfire and multiple fatalities. With states releasing a third wave of prisoners, crime is at an all-time high, and in a turn for the worse, we now have confirmation that the virus has become more lethal. After being the first U.S. territory affected almost nine months ago, the Pacific Northwest has now become the birthplace of this new strain, leaving thousands of victims in its wake, which now also includes the animal kingdom. It has become more resistant, and it no longer attacks only the elderly, but has reared its head in young adults, some as young as 12. We can only pray it does not grow stronger and set its sights on children. This is Channel 5 News signing off. Momma! Stay out of this room! No, I won't! She's mom! Sammy, could I watch Daddy's movie? Hey, sweetie. Don't show the kids this, okay? I gotta wait till nightfall to do it. But with that bridge gone, there's no way in, no way out. You guys are gonna be safer. Everyone's gonna be safer. But... If you hear those sirens go off, you gotta grab the kids. There's rumors of this secret ship coming through the city to help, but I don't know. You're just gonna have to take your chances, take our boat, the kids, and get onboard. You gotta get to Seattle and you gotta stay in the water. I'm gonna make it back. Just tell the kids I love 'em and I love you. I heard on the news police are letting bad guys out of jail. So we have to hide. If we hear the sirens, we have to do what Daddy says and get on the boat. I'll pretend the virus is not happening for you. Well, Dada and Momma will be... just like normal again. Dad will be back and Mom will be back to life again. Okay? One day she saw a trapped seal. She boost her horn to bust out of the ice. She was mother and his sister and brother and his family. Brody, look. That means Dad is coming home. Now? We'll follow the rainbow, and then we'll find Dada, and then we'll bring him back, and then he'll kiss Mother and then she'll wake up again. Do you have a crab? - Nope. - Go fish. Do you have a angler fish? That Dada outside? Lock the door. Hello? Brody, let me in! Please let me in! Let me in, Brody! I can't reach it! I'm trying! I'm trying! Dada... Dada... Dada. Dada. Dada. Dada. Brody, come on. Let's go. Grab your jacket. Come on. We have to go now. Brody, come on. Let's go. We gotta go the secret way. Brody, hurry. This way. Are you okay? It's not turning on! Let's go! There's rumors of a secret ship coming to the city to help, but I don't know. You're just gonna have to take your chances, take our boat, the kids, and get onboard. And last year I'd have called you crazy, but as we all know, the world is upside down right now. Do you have any idea what is happening in El Paso? In a word, no. As you know, El Paso saw an exodus from the city over the last several weeks. With hospitals full to the brim, morgues overwhelmed, bodies piling up, many citizens including city officials decided to pack up and leave, but that doesn't explain the communication blackout. Have you been able to make any sense of it? Unfortunately, that's just about impossible right now. Social media is awash with theories. Without any official reports, it's hard to say what's credible and what isn't. Some people are saying the government forced people to leave. Others claim that the entirety of civil leadership is in a bunker or dead or deliberately sabotaging the city. We have no indication whatsoever... Due to higher than normal call volume, we ask that you call back at a later time. Due to higher than normal call volume, we ask that you call back at a later time. We apologize for the inconven... Due to higher than normal call volume, we ask that you call back at a later time. We apologize... Oh, fuck. Ah. Due to higher than normal call volume, we ask that you call back at another time. We apologize for the inconvenience. Due to higher than normal call volume, we ask that you... We've definitely seen a shift, right? I mean, friends of mine who I frankly had to kidnap to get in public are now begging me to schedule video chats. So do introverts not exist, or do we just not understand wellness? Well, opportunities for interaction are becoming more scarce every day. As we've talked about, the social contact is just more than casual. It's also... Due to higher than normal call volume, we ask that you call back at a later time. We apologize for the inconvenience. Due to higher than normal call volume, we ask that you call back at a later time. We apologize for the inconvenience. Due to higher than normal call volume, we ask that you call back at a later time. We apologize for the inconvenience. Fuck. Fuck. Due to higher than normal call volume, we ask that you call back at a later time. We apologize for the inconvenience. Before we begin, how are you? How am I? Gosh, that used to be such an innocuous question, didn't it? I'd say probably better than most. Worse than some, feeling lucky, and I'm also desperately... Let's start at the beginning. You were working on this book before the virus hit, right? Yeah, it was a very different world. How did the pandemic change... A bigger problem for us is that this species provides next to no nutritional value. None at all. Why is that the case? Well, the scientific explanation is long and boring, but believe me when I tell you they're just not good for you. The virus might be a better place to get nutrients. So this could be as bad as the virus. - Sorry, sorry. - I shouldn't be. It's nothing to joke about. It's not that bad. But it wouldn't provide enough nutrients to make a meaningful part of your diet. With the virus already affecting the local food supply, it's the last thing you need. Normally this is the spot where I'd say thank you, but I actually for this conversation.

When the world is upside down, you need a source you can trust to help shoot you to the right path. Our team of world-renown journalists works day and night to bring you the news that is relevant, interesting, and most importantly... Riots broke out at the London borough of Woodgreen as locals who were turned away after waiting for hours for the nearby supermarkets to receive food deliveries that never came. This marks almost a full month of daily violence as the death toll from the virus continues to climb in the capital. The government has called for an immediate shutdown of all London Underground and tube services in an effort to prevent further spread and isolate outbreak areas. However, there is confusion over this plan, as there has been no changes to the buses which are operating normally throughout the city. The capacity of a double decker bus is 18.75 times 4.95 times 2.55 meters. At that size, we could be looking at anywhere between 70 and 100 barrels' worth of chemical agent traveling freely among the population. This is what's supplementing the dosage of the chem trails and the water pollution. The question is, is this related to the 5G towers, or is this a separate issue entirely? What am I missing? Who's sending the signals? Is this a coordinated attack with the organizations dosing us with the virus? How big is this? Hey there, fellow truth-seekers. Paige here, and welcome back to my channel. Now, I'm very excited to be sharing yet another breakthrough with you. I know that we keep getting buried by the B.S. from the mainstream media. However, we know for a fact that the 5G signals is what's causing the virus. However, I think I may have discovered yet another delivery sy... This delivery system is caused by the exhaust of buses, even more potent than the chem tra... Hang on. I've been feeling an almost unnatural presence in the flat for some time now. Like something's spying on me. Now, in 1984, the U.S. and Japanese governments started working with tech companies and some of the top Hollywood directors. They faked the moon landing, and now they've started working on these optical technologies which basically mean they can create invisible suits. Yeah. Invisible suits. That's so... These... These suits have been predominantly used for covert operations like the planting of thermite at the bottom of the Twin Towers, the high-profile assassinations... The technology uses screens to create projections around the wearer, which means that they can blend into their environment, but that's the problem. It can fool the naked eye, but cameras don't process it in the same way. So if you actually look at it through a camera lens, it means that the suit can occasionally glitch, and that is exactly why I have cameras all throughout my flat. Every single room. You hear that? Every single room. I'm recording you live. Don't think of doing anything, or your whole cover will be blown. Don't think I don't know what they do to operatives who blow their cover. Oh, that's... Okay. Okay. Okay. I got you. I got you. Okay. I got you. I fucking got you. Everyone saw. Everyone fucking saw. "They're inside you." Oh. Inside where? The CIA. Huh. The CIA put listening devices in their operatives. It can be disguised as fillings in the molar teeth. So it's not too much of a stretch to think that they could use them as a surveillance device. You're listening right now, aren't you? Can you hear me? Oh, you fuckers. I'm so close. I figured out your trick with the buses, and if you want to listen to what I have to say, then you are going to have to watch my videos. Show's over, assholes. I control me. I control me. I can control... And in Seattle, the record number of orphan children continues to grow as more kids are found either roaming the streets or trapped at home with their deceased parents. The psychological implications of these circumstances is disturbing. Hey, Momma. Hugging cat. Oh. Good evening. The death toll continues to rise throughout the U.S. with thousands of new cases being reported hourly. In a new study done by the Thompson Behavioral Institute of Florida, they have found there to be a significant uptick in conspiracy theories being spread across social platforms. One such theory has led to the death of a London influencer who live streamed herself fatally removing what she believed to be tracking devices implanted inside her by the government. Now following up on our breaking news story from last night, it is confirmed that a new mutation of the virus has been discovered here in Miami. The National Guard has been sent out by the government in an attempt to control any unrest, as scientists are not releasing any information about the deadly new strain at this time. We will, of course, keep you updated as new details come in. We urge you, please stay at home. Stay safe. And God bless us all. This is Cecilia Hernandez reporting. Did you get me any good footage? Well, hello to you, too. Listen, nobody gives a shit anymore about empty streets. I need something bigger. I need shit that's gonna make people cry, scare them. Look, I don't know what to tell ya. I've been scoping out hospitals, trying to get interviews, but nobody's coming out. Only going in. Okay. Have you ever heard of the Lanway family? Yeah, sure. Why? I just got a tip the other day from one of their neighbors. They said they see the nurse come in and out of the back frequently, but they haven't seen the family in weeks. Okay. And? And you're an investigative journalist. Go investigate. They're a really well-known family on the beach. If they're sick... That's good TV. Okay. And if I do this for you? You're on fucking retainer, Ryan. This is not me asking you. Get your ass out there now and start filming. I wanna see something tonight. Hi, it's Jen. Leave a message. Hey, babe. I'm just over at the beach right now. I gotta do this job. Won't be late. I'll meet you at home and I'll make dinner. Got one steak left in the fridge. I'd kill for a piece of meat. Guess that's it. All right, I'll see you soon. Love you. Okay. Ah, I'm gonna get fucking arrested for being here. This is so fucking weird. Oh, fuck. Fuck. Fu... Fuck! Oh, fuck! Oh, fuck! Fuck. Hello? Oh, God. Oh, shit! Shit! Oh, fuck! Oh, fuck. Oh, fuck. Oh, fuck! Oh, shit! Pick up. Fuck, Ryan. Pick up! Lazy fucker. Stay away from the walls! Don’t make them angry. Can you hear me? Who are you? What’s going on? Did they take your clothes, too? Tell me, what’s going on here? I don’t know. Seems we are trapped. Did they give you water and food as well? Yes. They want us to survive. At least for a while. “They?" What do you know? How long have you been here? Woke up maybe just an hour before you. I can only guess. What is the last thing you remember? Why should I tell you anything? As far as I know, you could be my kidnapper. Or you mine. I’m afraid we are in this together. They broke in, forced us down like terrorists. What about your result? I don’t know. After they tested us, they injected me with some drug. They took me with them. He was left behind. Then all went black. "Him?" I’m sorry. Feel your neck. They burn a symbol on the back of your neck to mark you as virus positive or negative. I can feel the scab, but can’t make it out. Neither can I. All by ourselves, none of us can tell. What are those noises? I don’t want to know. Why are we here? If we were infected, they’d leave us for good. Have you heard about the experiments? Another conspiracy theory... Not just a theory. They use the infected as human guinea pigs to run tests on them. They can’t do that. Just like they can't storm in, take you and put you in this crate? They use the pandemic to their advantage. Do all kind of tests on the infected. For the big pharma, the military, even space science. First they started abducting only homeless people. Seems they have expanded their field. Ben told me about a friend who just disappeared. When he came back he was only a shadow of his former self. A vegetable like some walking dead. You see! We have to get out of here. Get out? There’s no way out. What is this? Oh my God! What’s happening? Talk to me! The thing next to me seems angry and big. Really big! You’re okay? Yes. What the hell are those things? Maybe this is hell. I don’t want to end up like this. Neither do I. If we are positive for the virus, we die anyway. You mentioned a “Ben” before. Do you know what happened to him? He’s gone. How do you know? I don’t feel him anymore. Then he might be better off than us. Wait! Do you hear that? They are coming for us. They won't get me. Me neither. Here, come here! I am here. Sit down. Let us sit down together! I can feel you. What’s your name? Eva. Then I’m Adam. We’ll meet at some better place. Oh, my God! No! Oh, no. Oh, my God. No! Help! I need help! Help! Oh! Fuck, no! No, don't! Help! What's that sound? Someone's coming. Brody, shh! Let us out!
