[chuckles] That woman say this engine won't start. Yeah, well, it won't. You know, Monty, he was supposed to fix it. Never did. He don't know what he doing. That fool can't even see. I saw your momma the night you were made. What'd you say to me? Don't you make me put this baby down. That ain't no way to talk to me. I gave this car service one of its best clients. Yeah, you never let me forget it neither. That's right. Maya, I'll take a look at it for you, baby. - Take a seat. - Thank you. You all right? And you better do something, you know Chico quit. You don't want to lose my boss as a client. Ma'am. Here you go, Willie. [Willie] How much is here? [Monty] Not enough, but I'll get it to you. I promise. Okay? Hey, hey, man, look. I just lost one of my drivers. He was the only one classy enough to drive the old corporate types. - Now, listen to me... - No, no, no, Willie. You know I can't stand them. Hear me out. The pay is good. - The stuck-up types. - Oh, come on, now. It would help you make more of a down payment for this place. Man, Willie. You know I'm better under the hood than I am behind the wheel, man. Do you really want to buy this place? Now this is a start. The pay is good. I got you a good client, and she pays well. I don't want to lose her. - I'll think about it. - You'll think... what? I'll think... what? Watch it, old man. You watch it. Maya, turn the key? [engine starts] Oh, ho, ho. - [Maya] Thank you, Monty. - All right, baby. You know, this should really be your place. Oh, it will be soon, baby. A'ight. [men chatting] - Hey, boy. How you been? - What up, Kevin. - All right? - Yeah. Oh, man. Oh, man. Wilbert! Get up! - Hey, Monty. - Hey, Ms. Rochelle. You got people stepping all over you! - He at it again? - Get up! Always. Always. [woman] Hi, Monty! Wilbert! Get up, boy! [Monty] Is anybody home? [coughs] Sierra? [coughing] Get the door. Who is it? [Monty] Who is it? It's your daddy. Open up. Hey, y'all, it's daddy! [both] Daddy! [Monty] Come on, y'all. Hurry up. Hey. What up, come here, come here, come here. What's going on? Can I come in? [giggling] Hey, Ms. Kat. [coughs] Hey, Daddy, what'd you bring us? Oh, now, is that all I'm good for? No. - Can I get some love? - [laughter] Daddy, you know I got a "B" on my class project? [Monty] Oh. - Thanks for helping me. - What'd I tell you? Girl's gonna get a good grade. And I did. Hey, daddy? Will you take us to the movies this weekend? - No. - [coughs] Okay. I'll take you out to the movies. You know, Saturday is daddy-daughter day so. Okay. So, Daddy, what did you bring us? Just some food, baby. Oh! - Dad... - That always comes in handy. [laughter] You girls go in the room, let me talk to your daddy. Get in there. Don't make me come in there. What y'all doing, playing checkers? Huh? You're always playing something. [girls arguing] Here, Ms. Kat, I got 200 this week. I'll owe the rest to you. [coughing] You know, Ms. Kat, you know you gotta take care of that cough. I mean, it sounds like it's getting worse every time I come up in here. [sniffs] Yeah. [sighs] Jenny been by? That daughter of mine? No. Only time I see her is when she's driving by. She ain't been here to see these girls in months. So happy you're here, or they wouldn't know they had a daddy or a momma. Monty? You sit back. Sit down. What's wrong? [sighs] I need you to go down to family court with me right away, so you can tell them that you're taking the girls. I need you to raise them. Ms. Kat, you know I love my kids, but I can't take them full-time... Then they gonna have to stay with their mom. - Now, you know I don't want that. - Neither do I. Especially since she's living with that Joe, the biggest drug dealer in the area. Sitting up there in that window, staring down at all of us like he's God. And she's right there with him. She don't care about nobody but herself. Do you know what'll happen to them girls if they have to live with their momma? Huh? God forbid. - Monty, please. - Ms. Kat, I... I... I have lung cancer. I am dying, Monty. I've been hanging in here for them girls as long as I can, but I'm dying. I'm dying. Why didn't you say something? Why didn't you tell me this? [sighs] Ms. Kat, it's gonna be all right. It is not gonna be all right. [church bell rings] Watch your step right here. Why didn't y'all call me? Mommy! - Don't look at her. - [Jenny] No, wait. Wait, where do you think you're going? These are my kids. Stop. Stop. Get out of here! Get in the car, baby. Stop. Quit it! No, you get off of me! Stop it, Jenny! Stop it. For real. Everything all right, baby? No, you get my kids out of this car! [screaming] Jenny, stop, stop! You have not been to see these kids in months. You want to come take them now? Huh? Get off of me! You gotta be crazy. Get out of here. Nah, you need to back up, son. Yo, do me a favor, shut up. Stop it! Stop it, stop it! Go ahead, baby. Go ahead. This is your mother's funeral, and you know she wanted these girls to go with him. Jennifer, you know it. You out whoring around with these thugs. She didn't want these girls around all of this foolishness. Let me tell you something, Aunt Rita. All right, these are my kids! Do you hear me? You ain't just gonna take 'em from me! And let me tell you, go make your mechanic money. You save it, 'cause we're going to court, you hear me? Give me my kids back. You're gonna give them back to me. You stay outta my way! What are you doing? Think you gonna let my momma die? Huh? You gonna let them bury my momma, and you don't tell me, Willie? [man] You should've been there for your momma. [Jenny] You know it ain't right. [woman] Too late now. [Sierra] Daddy, you know this place is too small for all of us. [Lauryn] Well, we don't have anywhere else to go. [China] we can go live with momma. China, momma don't want us. She never did. - That's not true. - It is true. - Is that true, daddy? - I'll tell you what is true. I want y'all to come stay with me. Hmm? Where we gonna sleep? Well, I'm gonna sleep on the couch, and you guys, I mean girls, are going to sleep in the bedroom. I fixed it up. How bad was it before? Daddy? China pees in the bed. And I ain't sleeping with her. I do not! Why you gotta put all my business out like that? What's wrong with you? Whatever. We need some separate beds or some bunk beds or something, 'cause this ain't gonna work. Well, I'll work on it, okay? Well, while you work on it, how about feeding us and getting all three of us some food? 'Cause all three of us are hungry. You know what? You got a mouth like your momma. You need to put your clothes in them drawers right here, thank you. I like this bedroom. [police sirens in distance] Lord, how am I going to do this? Man, I can't believe I'm doing this. You waiting for Ms. Rossmore? Uh, yeah. Rossmore. Julia rossmore. [chuckles] Good luck. - [chuckling] - What you mean, "Good luck"? - Good day, Ms. Rossmore. - Good morning. You gonna open the door? Uh, yeah, yeah. - Can you close the door? - Oh, yeah. Oh. - [laughs] - What you laughing at? [Julia] Tell him to meet me there. Tell him to wait, then. I'm surprised the jury's returned so soon myself. That's a great thing. Yeah, definitely. All right, see you in a second. Did they tell you I need you to be on call? Oh, you talking to me? You're the only other person in the car. Oh, no, you know what, I thought you were still on the phone, you know. Well, basically all I need you to do is get me to the office and get me to court. Mm-hmm. Sometimes I work late, and sometimes I entertain clients after work, that sort of thing. You know what, Ms. Rossmore? Right now, I need all the overtime I can get. I'm sorry, what's your name? - Oh, Monty. - Monty. Look, I don't like to fraternize, so let's keep this strictly professional, okay? - Yes, ma'am. - Fabulous. [whistles] [beatboxing] Excuse me? I'm sorry about that. Hah. [sighs] [loud rap on radio] Are you... am I getting punk'd? No, you're not getting punk'd, ma'am. I just, you know, thought you might want the radio... - No, I like silence. - Yes, ma'am. [Julia] Silence. You've missed your turn. I asked you to take the freeway. Oh, you know what? This way is much faster. - Excuse me? - Yeah, you seem like you're a rush. And this way is faster, so... Yeah, I am in a rush and I know this city. The freeway would've bypassed all of this lunchtime traffic. I cannot believe this. Why are you stopping? 'Cause we're here now. - Next time, follow my instructions, okay? - Oh, yes, ma'am. Ms. Rossmore? [judge] The jury has a question that they need answered. They want to know if the damage award can be higher than what was previously requested. Well, your honor... So how's the driving going? Oh, look, she is something else. I know, I've worked for her four years. She's good, though, she wins every case. And this is a big one. [judge] One word for you, counselor-settlement. That means she just won a grip of money. - She's that good. - Mm-hmm. My client's willing to talk. Oh, and she's also impatient so you might want to get out to the car. Sorry, my bad. Your honor, the people have no evidence. - We have evidence. - That is not admissible. The search warrant gave them the right to search the house, not the car. - He's right. - Your honor... The evidence of the drugs is inadmissible. [criminal lawyer] In that case, your honor, we immediately ask that all the charges be dropped, and that the case be dismissed without prejudice... [D.A.] Your honor, we need to get him out of the neighborhood. Then your officers should've been more careful. Where is your eyewitness? He has intimidated the entire community. Then your office has its work cut out for them. I'm dismissing all the charges. Adjourned. [laughs] They can't hold me, baby. Mm. - You're the man. - Thank you. You want some pizza? All right, I'm gonna bring some for you, all right? I'll be there soon. - [Jenny laughs] Yes. - I love you. You know how we do. [chuckles] - Well, do you see this? - Yeah, I see it. Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. - Whoa, whoa. - I see. You looking like a little massa' boy. Wow, so you had to get yourself another job, huh? Yeah, I know, feedin' them girls ain't easy, huh? Here, oh, let me help you out. Let me see what I got in here. Oh, look at that. Here. - Take it. - Stop it. Take it. Oh, so what you Mr. Do the right thing? Oh, so you don't want this money. It's okay, I'll take it back. - You gonna leave me alone? - What you gonna do, baby? You see that brother right there? If I even break a nail, he will shut you down. - [scoffs] - And I'm coming for my daughters. You don't even want your kids. Huh? Now why would you do all this... You tried to turn my momma against me. Huh? You tried to turn my kids against me, it ain't gonna happen, baby. Yeah, I'm gonna make your life hell, little punk. Look at him, Joe. I think he gettin' mad. He ain't gonna do nothing. He's so scared to go back to jail. Yeah, go on lookin' like a slave. Go on, suh. Mosey on down. Go on and drive the car. [Joe] Let step-and-fetch-it get back to work, now. Hey, man, nice suit. [Jenny] Step-and-fetch-it. Look at you. Lookin' just like a broke down slave. I must've been a fool having three babies by you. Ugh, please, yuck! I'm just disgusted with myself. [Joe laughs] - Oh, do you think that's him? - I think that's him. [clears throat] - Hi. - Excuse me. Is this Ms. Rossmore's car? Uh, who's asking? - Yup, this is it. - This is it. - Excuse us. - It's okay. - No, we got it. - Got it. We know her. Thank you. -Okay. Okay -Thank you. Oh, goodness. Uh, Ms. Rossmore, you, uh, you have somebody... - You gonna open my door? - Uh, you have... - Are you going to open my door? - Mm-hmm. [Julia] Oh, what are you doing in my car? It's that time. - No, no. - Yes. I just want to celebrate winning this case, okay? Third and Peachtree, please. I'm gonna, I'm gonna have to pass on the blind date. I knew she was gonna say that. Didn't I tell you now? - You're going out. - I can't. Do you know what your associates are saying about you at the office? I don't care. They're saying that you need a man. Okay, and that you're taking it out on everyone at the office. And they also say that you would be a nicer person if you just got laid. - I agree. - [coughs] I don't need to get laid, as you so eloquently put it. Yes, you do. Look, we have been your friends since college. We know what you need. Well, if you know me so well, you'd know that I don't like blind dates. Ah. - They all end in disaster. - Julia. First of all, I have a very, very good feeling about this one, I do. [rhythmic clinking] Uh. All right, so, Julia, I heard you was like a lawyer and stuff. I am. Yeah, so you got this then? - The... the bill? - Yes. [both chuckle] No, I'm serious though. This' a nice place, I like this... environment. You know, it's gangsta. Feel like, you know, you could do some things in here. Mm. You know what else is nice? Hmm? You got some sexy-ass lips. Mm! Just wanna bite 'em, argh. Suck on 'em, suck your lips off your face. Mm. Yeah. I am gonna kill Cynthia and Brenda. Holla. You don't want to mess with your boy right here. I mean, if you like pleasure. Hey, hey! Hey! Hey! Hey, come here, man. Yes, sir. What kind of fish is this fill-et mig-non? I'm sorry? Y'all got Chinese food? [waiter] Uh, I'm sorry, we don't, sir. But how can I help you? You know what? Just give me some scrimps, man, and some, uh, some hot sauce, and some fries with it. And for the lady? You know what? This water is gonna be just fine. So we can just, speed the whole thing along. - I understand. - I bet you do. - And your scrimps will come out right away, sir. - [Julia] Thank you. Can we get some bread, man? We the only table without bread. All the white people got bread. [waiter] I apologize, sir. - I'll get that to you right away. - Thank you. That's a lot of hot sauce. Wow. What do you do for a living? Well, right now I'm between jobs, so I decided I'm gonna be a rapper. [Squishing and slurping] A rapper? - Yeah. - That's somethin'. Straight up. Check it out. ♪ Uh, uh, uh, uh ♪ ♪ I'm-a spit you somethin' Off the dome ♪ ♪ Mm-a just right here 'Cause we alone ♪ ♪ Uh, uh ♪ ♪ A-Julia, you know I never make a fool-a-ya ♪ ♪ Uh, you and me It's like we outta space ♪ ♪ I wanna wrap them legs Around my waist ♪ ♪ And in my face! ♪ - You feel me? - Um. Mm. Man, I be feelin' that. It's like I just... I'm sorry, how old are you? Forty, shorty. - Forty? - Yeah. You don't think that's too old to start a rap career? Why everybody keep saying that? I mean, yeah, but, you know, I'm good, and I got a gimmick. You got to have a gimmick in this game. You heard of 50 Cent? - Yes. - They call me 40 Percent. Check please! Check. They call me 40-p! [Julia] Oh, it's official. No, this is my proclamation, Cynthia. I'm giving up on men. - Why? - 'Cause I'm 31, I've never been married, I don't have any kids, I don't even have a cat to curl up with, and because I make six-figures, I can't find a decent man to save my life. - What was wrong with this guy? - Are you kidding me? The man had no class, Cyn. No, he had no class. He was screaming across the restaurant for some scrimps. - [stifled laugh] - Yeah, scrimps. I don't even know how to spell scrimps. Am I being unreasonable? All I want is a man who knows when to hold me, and rub my feet and make me feel safe. Is that too much to ask? Not, sweetie, it's all possible if you just relax your standards a little bit. Girl, whatever. What's up with black men all trying to be down? All of a sudden, everybody's gotta be down. Like speaking correct English is somehow uncool. Like, verb-noun agreement is just too much. And if I see another black man over 30 in a throwback jersey, girl, I'm gonna scream. [Julia screaming] What was that? I just saw one. Julia, I just think you're too hard on some of these guys, okay? You just need to relax a little bit. Excuse me. I have standards. Yeah, well, the Pope can't meet your standards. Okay? And I don't mean to be rude, sweetie, but, I got a man waiting for me, and I gots to go. No, go. No, go, it's cool. Don't, don't hate. I'm not hatin', Cyn. [Cynthia] All right, you sound just like... No, my battery's dying anyway. Wait, I can't... I... can't... - [voice breaking up] - Hello? [phone ringing] You gotta be kidding me. I am so sorry... - You gotta be kidding me. - I'm sorry. [phone vibrating] You're gonna answer it. You know what, I gotta get this one. Uh, this is my neighbor and she got my kids. Excuse me. Unbelievable. Hold up. Okay. You're on company time. You're not supposed to be taking personal calls. Well, what happened? Yeah, I know where it is. I'm on my way. [Julia] Whoa. Whoa. Where are you taking me? - Lady... - I'm being kidnapped. I'm being kidnapped! Somebody help! - Stop. - You stop, 'cause you're in big trouble, pal. Look, lady, look, I'm sorry... No, no, no, you're gonna be sorry. You know, you have a big problem 'cause you're fired! Fired! I have a problem right now and I'm so tired of your stuck-up ass giving me a hard time. Now, do me a favor. Sit back, shut up, and ride, okay? Thank you. Oh. I do not believe this. No way. No way. No. No, he didn't do this. Excuse me? I'm Monty James, you have my kids here? Have a seat. Someone will be with you in a minute. Are they here? Excuse me, are they all right? - Have a seat, sir. - Where are they? Excuse me, excuse me. Where are they? Have a seat, sir. Did he take... he took the keys. He took the keys. - [honking] - Fabulous. I'm just gonna call, who can I call? Oh, my battery's dead. Great. No. No. Julia, no. You're in control, here, and... You're just gonna walk in there and demand he take you home. Take me home, wodie. No, that... do they say that? No. Take me home, Brother. Yes. [nurse] Just calm down, she's gonna be okay. Hey. Look, I try to support black-owned businesses, but this is absolutely ridiculous. Take me home now. Monty, Ms. Rossmore... Maya, what are you doing here? I live next door to your... Monty. Your driver. Well, he's not my driver after tonight, thank you very much. Next time you want to recommend a little car service to me, Maya, make sure it's not one of your buddies from the hood, okay? Maya, what happened? Well, there was a fire, and then... Uh, Jennifer Jackson, Monty James? [Monty] Yeah, right here. Laurie Bell, department of social services. Are my kids all right? Where they at? They're fine, they're being looked after. Mr. James, this could've been really bad. I know, I know. I had to work tonight, and, um, the oldest one, she's old enough to look after the little ones... And I live right next door. This is my neighbor here... Well, your daughter started a fire. Now, I'm sure it was an accident. The fire wasn't that bad, but if your neighbor had not broken down the door, your daughters could've died of smoke inhalation. Now we're gonna have to look after your daughters for a little while. Oh, no, no, this is a mistake... It's a mistake that could've gotten them killed, Mr. James. Now, you can call about visitation, but for now, they're in custody of their mother. No, ma'am, no, no. No. Uh, let me talk to the little one, please? - Look, all right... - Mr. James... Mr. James, I'm sorry. - Go get my kids. Just go get my kids... - Come on, Mrs. Jackson. Hold on, hold on... And my mother had the nerve to think that you would do a better job than me. So I guess this right here is a better job? Almost killing my kids? - Just go get little China... - No, go get nothin'. You know we gonna get custody now, right? And we'll enjoy raising your little girl... No, you won't! [indistinct yelling] - You want to start with me? - Give me a reason. - You want to start something, Monty? - Monty! You picked the wrong person to mess with. - [man] Yeah, yeah. - Back up. This is not the place. All right. Let me get my kids, man, just let me get my kids, man. - Got you, player. - What you say... Monty. Is he gonna take me home? How old are your girls? Five, seven, and twelve. Look, I'm sorry about before. Are they gonna be okay? If you don't mind, I don't want to talk about it. I'm sorry. [Willie] Yeah. Uh, he's walking in right now. I promise you I'll take care of it myself. Please, please forgive me. Thank you for your business. What? I told you I couldn't do it. I told you, man, I'm glad she called and fired me. You feel sorry for them girls. You get that court date yet? Custody hearing's in seven days. I called like, like nine lawyers this morning, they all said the same thing. They need more money and more time. Don't look at me. I just feel like, you know, I make two steps forward, I gotta make four steps back. All Ms. Kat asked me to do was raise them kids. And, I can't even do that. You know Jennifer and that crack dealer, they got long money. You gonna need some help from God and two more white people to fight them. [sighs] So my assignment today is to encourage your faith by using what Paul said. He says, "And let us not grow weary in well-doing." He said, "For in due season, you shall reap if you faint not." Now, what I'm trying to tell you... [cheering and applause] ...is that God is faithful. And in His faithfulness, he reminds us that in doing good, you shall get weary. There's no sin in getting weary, the sin is giving up, because I'm here to announce to you, you're so close to your due season, you're about to taste it, there's about to be a manifestation of God... [cheering and applause] ...in your life, and it's not time to throw in the towel. It's time to lift up your head, because something's about to happen in your life, and God's gonna ensure it. The evidence that you're so close to your breakthrough, the evidence that you're so close to your payday and your reward for walking righteous is that you will feel like, you better hear this - I'm telling you something... - [cheering] ...you will feel like you're about to faint. And when you feel like you're about to faint, don't faint. Because that says that I'm right there next to my miracle. I'm right there, right at the door of my due season. I'm talking to those that walked into this church today with their head kind of hung down, and just about to give up and about to lose your faith. I'm encouraging you, keep the faith! Stay right there. Don't faint. Hold on. God is about to bring your due season! And you need to give Him praise, you need to bless His name, you need to tell him, I'm still holding on. God bless you, God bless you, and god bless you. [cheering and applause] [sobbing] You know how you working my man's nerve with that whining? You think I'm gonna let you come in between me and my man with all that mess? You gonna stop that. I want my daddy. Well, you ain't goin' back to your daddy. - Why? - Because I said so, that's why. You gonna stay right here with me. [sobs] And you're goin'. China, you gonna stop that whining. China, get in there, get in there. You gonna stay here with me, you ain't going back to your daddy. Now you get in there until you figure that out. - [China screams] - Get in there. Lauryn, go in there with her. Go talk to your sister. I gotta tell you something, now, y'all better be glad I know Jesus. [door slams] [sighs] Y'all get on my nerves. - ♪ Stand on his word ♪ - ♪ Stand on his word ♪ ♪ And lay your hand upon him ♪ ♪ 'Cause he knows And he loves you ♪ ♪ And he did it for me ♪ ♪ And I say to you ♪ ♪ I stand beside ♪ ♪ I'll say all those words ♪ ♪ Gotta get out Of your way, Jesus ♪ ♪ Tell 'em ♪ ♪ And let you take control ♪ ♪ Just like you ♪ ♪ I was just like you ♪ ♪ I gotta get out Of your way, Jesus ♪ Thank you, Father! ♪ I can't love you any more ♪ ♪ I gotta let you Take control ♪ ♪ Yeah ♪ ♪ Yes, I will, Jesus ♪ ...really good. I'm over here. Mm-hmm, selling drugs right out here in front of this holy place. [Maya] Oh, my goodness. You know what? They need to be stopped. Janis' son got caught selling in school, and said he got it from him. He comes to school and recruits the kids, babies, Monty. Mm-hmm. And then he sends them to go sell. You know, Monty, you really need to come to this community meeting. Monty, a lot of people respect you in this neighborhood, and they still remember. Hmm. - You should come to one of the meetings. - I know. I'm praying for you, and for you to get your girls back. [chuckles] - I'll baby-sit anytime, okay? - Oh, I'll baby-sit, too. Honey, the devil never wins, unless you don't fight. Yeah. You're right. All right, well, I'll see you all later. Okay, baby. Oh, I'm going back in for a piece of cake. Give Danny your change. Now, you know, baby, you're old enough to understand some things, okay. All right? Now, you ain't gonna just be sitting around here living off of me. You got that? Hey, look at me while I'm talking to you. Look at me while I'm talking to you, I said. Don't you dare not look at me. It's time for you to start your own hustle. - No, no, no. No. - What do you mean, "no"? - Are you telling me... - I'm not a hustler. No, you... you... You gonna be whatever I tell you gonna be. I'm trying to teach you how never to be broke another day in your life. The number one rule to the game is never get caught. You got that? Now, I'm about to go get a drink. You want one? [telephone rings] Willie's garage. Can I help you? Hold on. Monty, telephone. Yo. Yeah? What? We called her mother, but no one answered. This kind of thing is frowned upon, Mr. James. Yes, sir. C.C., where'd you get this from? Huh? Go ahead and answer me. Joe. - Joe gave you this? - Who is Joe? Joe is, uh, her mother's boyfriend. What is wrong with you, C.C.? - Huh? Did you lose your mind? - I don't want you to die. What are you talking about? He said if I didn't do it, he was gonna get one of his boys to take you out. And Joe's crazy, Daddy. He'll do it. - I know he will. - It's okay. ...that's my daughter in there. Hey, didn't I tell you not to call him? These are my kids. He has no right to my kids. Did you give this to my daughter to sell? - Is this punk talking to me? - No, I don't think so. - I'll take that as a yes. - Look, man... Daddy! [grunting] I got you now. Look at him. Look at him. - Security, get up here now. - You want to play? - Daddy! - Right away. The principal's office. Let him go! [Joe] I run this, man. Ain't nothing you can do about it. - These are my streets! - It's okay, baby. Do yourself a favor, Monty, live. 'Cause if you keep coming at me the way you coming at me, we won't need a custody hearing, you heard me? - [Jennifer] Stop it, Sierra. - Let me go! Oh, daddy's all right. - Daddy's all right. - Daddy, please, can we go? [Jennifer] Sierra, come on. - Sierra. - You're all right. I'm gonna... look, it's gonna be all right. I can't take you now. - Sierra, come on. - Let me go! - Don't grab her like that. - Stop it, both of you. I love you, all right? - Stop grabbing her like that. - What you doing, sierra? Huh? It's gonna be all right, C.C. What the deal? Why you gonna come up in here... If you come up in front of me again, I swear to God, you'll never see another daylight in your life. [school bell rings] [elevator bell dings] - [man] Good morning. - Hi. Excuse me. ...Exactly, and your eight o'clock appointment is all set. - Okay. - Mr. Farnberg called. Oh, and I was able to reschedule your hair appointment for next Tuesday. - Okay. - Also... What? Hey. What are you doing in here? I need, I needed to talk to you. That's what I was trying to tell you, Mr. James is here. Yeah, obviously. Did you just let him in my office? Well, he said he's here to drive you home. Call security. No, you ain't gotta call security. I don't know what I was thinking coming here talking to you. I'll just leave. I'm sorry. What do you want from me? I gotta talk to you about my kids. - Maya, can you give us a second, please? - Yes, ma'am. I... I gotta get my girls back. Okay, what you need is a family law attorney, okay. And if you can't afford one, the court will appoint one. I can't walk in there with a public lawyer. Their mama is spending a lot of money on a lawyer, and I need a bulldog like you... No offense. Look, our firm charges $500 an hour. Can you afford that? I got $1,200 to my name. - Look, mister... - No, no. Just call me Monty. Look, sister, I'm trying to get... - Typical. Typical. - What? I thought more of you, but it's real typical. I'm not your sister, okay? I don't appreciate you coming into my office asking for favors, playing the race thing. It's sad and it's pathetic. What are you getting out of this? - Hmm? - What? Why do you want your daughters back so badly? You getting a check for them, or some sort of government assistance? Go to hell. Wow. That, that, my friend, is exactly how you get what you want... Insult me. Great strategy. I see why you're so successful. Get a man, get a life. Thank you. Excuse me, are any of you ladies named Julia? - No. - No. Sorry to bother you. - Mm-hmm. - Mmm. Damn! Julia? - Christopher? - Yes. - Please, call me Chris. - Sure. - May I? - Oh, please. Sorry. Um, I'm sorry for staring, it's just that you're beautiful than your friend said. Thank you. You're welcome. - So, you're a lawyer. - Yes, I am. Me, too. - Really? - Mm-hmm. Mostly corporate stuff, tax stuff, it's pretty boring. What about you? Our firm handles some criminal, some civil. - Okay. What firm? - Rossmore and Blake. Oh. - Hmm. - What? I applied for a job there, and they turned me down. Said that my resume was a little bit shallow. That's what the old fart said. What's he... How's he doing these days? He, uh, retired to Florida. Oh, you keep up with him? He's my father, the fart. Oh. Uh... Check, please. [chuckles] I'm sorry. That was embarrassing. Don't worry about it. He can be a little tough on people he doesn't know that well. Hmm. Well, they must be big wingtips to fill. Actually, I try to fill my own stilettos. Touche. And I will try to keep my foot out of my mouth for the rest of this conversation. It's cute. You should leave it there. [chuckles] Well, if it's what the lady like, then I will. Oh, I like. Would you like anything to drink? Um, a latte would be great. Okay. Coming right up. Thank you, Jesus. So, I had an amazing time. This was one of the best dates I've ever been on. Me, too. I would like to see you again. Yeah? I'd like that. - [tires screech] - [dog growling] Who the hell is this, Chris? Uh, this is, uh... - Baby, you're supposed... - Who are you? I was... I was just saying good-bye, ma'am. Yeah, you better go, slut. You see, right now, this is his family. Get away from my daddy, tramp! - Junior, i... - Excuse me! You trying to be playing playa, huh? Where is your wedding ring? I am so tired of you! Get in the car! Ow! Ow! Ow! Where's your lawyer? Uh, sir, I can't afford one, but I do have all my paperwork, Your Honor. - And... - Are you ready to begin? Uh, yes, sir. - My kids were taken from me... - The court is aware of that. But first, I'd like to hear about the incident that happened at school. Your honor, he gave my daughter weed to sell in school, so I had... Mr. James has no evidence to support that allegation. However, we have documentation that demonstrates that Mr. James has a history of violent behavior. Your Honor, look, I'm caught between a rock and a hard place here. You know, the courts won't help me. My daughters are living with this man. You know, what am I supposed to do right here? [lawyer] Your Honor, not only are we requesting full custody with no visitation, but also a restraining order against Mr. James. He assaulted my client and threatened bodily injury. Your Honor, this man is giving drugs to my kids! What proof of that do you have? Absolutely none... - Your honor? - Ms. Rossmore. I'll be representing Mr. James. I'd like to request a continuance at this time so I might be brought up to speed. [lawyer] Your Honor, this has gone on long enough. My client is ready to put this behind her. Perhaps counsel might like to remind his client that in family court, it's not what's best for the parent but rather what's in the best interest of the child. That being said, I think these children need effective counsel. [judge] Ms. Rossmore, you are appointed by the court as guardian for the children. When I hear this case on the reset date, I want evidence, not just accusations and speculation. This case is continued for 30 days. [Julia] Your Honor, during that time, we'd like to request full custody to be granted to the father. [judge] You're pushing your luck. Full custody remains with the mother. Father will have visitation one day a week. Adjourned. You have really interesting taste in women. [chuckles] Nah, that's not the girl I met in high school. Nope. She's changed. I think the hood has a way of bringing out the best and worst in people. That's not just the hood, Monty, that's life. Yeah, maybe you're right. We had big dreams though. Big dreams. Then, I guess, you know, reality set in. Really? What kind of dreams did you have? I'm a mechanic, and, you know, I wanted to open my own shop. - Oh. - I'm good with cars, you know, so that's my hustle. You should open that shop one day. Well, I had to use the money That I had saved on my kids. - Oh. - It was worth it though. You know, I think that parents sometimes, they gotta give up their dreams so their kids can have one. Thank you. - Thank you so much. - All righty. You giving me hope. Thank you. Great. Cool. Okay. [clears throat] Um... Ahem. Come by tomorrow evening after work. We're gonna have to do all this after hours. Okay. And if you could bring any receipt that pertains to the kids' expenses or anything else you could possibly think of that can help us win the case... So, thank you. [inhales deeply] [Maya] No, no, no. This needs to be addressed. He is the councilman. He needs to know what the real issues are. You the one we elected, you supposed to do something. [approving murmurs] Quite, quite please. One at a time. One at a time. Yes, you, ma'am. I'm scared to go to the mailbox on the first because they be watching me. [approving murmurs] All right. Yes, sir. That Joe boy has been selling drugs on this block for years. Well, have you called the police? What good would that do? He's been arrested five times, and he keeps coming back. You gotta do something. [approving murmurs] What did I miss? Oh, more of the same. Still complaining. Let me tell you why he's gonna keep getting off, because none of you in this neighborhood will testify against him. [disapproving murmurs] What if we did? I mean, what if we did testify? Who's gonna protect us? - That's right! - Yeah! You... they don't even come when you call them in this neighborhood now. May I say something please? Yes, sir. I've been in this neighborhood for almost 67 years. I watched Dr. King walk this very street to go to the barber shop. I remember Billie Holiday, who checked into what used to be the only hotel in the south that would allow black people, right here on Auburn Avenue. What I remember most was we used to be a people that would take care of ourselves. Nobody never gave us nothing. We all earned it. We look at these politicians and ask for their help. It ain't up to them. It's up to us. And if we all stand up together, then maybe they'll come and help us. That's the history of us as a people. [cheering] We have to get our neighborhood back. [Monty] Wow, I can see my whole neighborhood up here. It ain't but five, ten blocks, but, it's a whole different world out there. And the highway run right through... - Monty, I have a question. - Yeah? When did you and their grandmother file this with the family court? Oh, pardon me. It was like a, a month before the fire. There. See the date? Thank you. So, you've been supporting these children their whole lives? - Yeah. - Hmm. "Hmm," what? No, you should be proud of that. I'm... that's all I'm saying. You should be proud of that, it's... I mean, judging from these passed years tax returns and how much you spend on them, it's commendable. Don't be surprised. I mean, I know the world will have you thinking that, you know, brothers in hood don't look after their kids, but, I mean, I know there's some that don't, but I do. I love my kids, and I want them back. Oh, well, you know, I think, I think we have enough info here to begin preparing a really, really solid case. You know, there's something I have to ask though. Yeah? Are there any surprises in your past that I should know about? - [telephone rings] - Oh, sorry. I'm sorry. Yes? Cynthia? No. No, no. I know it's 6:30. I'm not going. 'Cause I don't want to go on any more blind dates. He was a 40-year-old rapper. No, I didn't hear his demo tape. Bye. Uh... bye. Thank you, bye. Sorry. Why did you, Why'd you go on them dates? Hmm? Why'd you go on them blind dates? Excuse me? When I was driving you, you know, you had your home girl set you up on a blind date and I'm like, "Why you need that? You're so beautiful." You really want to know? I need to...[chuckles] I mean, I need to know. I mean... [sighs] Because it's really hard to meet a nice black man. It... it is! It is. And when you're in corporate America, like me, the people you work with don't look like you. And if you're a black woman that wants to actually date a black man, kind of difficult. No, seriously. And if you want a black man that has good credits, actually wants to date a black woman... Mm-hmm. ...and doesn't play video games, Ho! Good luck. Well, I love me some black women. Where's my money? I don't have it. We can see that. [Joe] Oh, well, that's $700, kid. See, now the problem is, that comes from queen bee's account. And, as you can see, she a little pissed off about it. Baby, you want to call this one? Oh, baby, you gonna let me do it? - Oh, for sure. - Oh. Go do what you do. [grunts] Now, kick his ass. [grunting] That's 150, 275! That's a good 350 right there. Stop it! Stop it! [grunting] Stop it! Man, okay! Okay! Get him up out of here. Get him up out of here. Get him up out of here! Yo, light up my blowtorch. I'll be down there in about 20 minutes. What you laughing for? That ain't funny! I'm laughing at you, 'cause, baby, he deserves to be beat. Okay? It's a tough world out here, And I'm getting you ready for it. Ain't nothing given to you, girl? No, you got to take it. Now, I'm gonna wipe those little sweet dreams out of your head, okay, baby, if it's not the last thing that I do. Now, get your little black ass back in that bedroom before I have to smack it. You looking at me though! Oh, I'm about to come in there in a minute. I got a big belt. [Julia] Okay, I think that's about enough for tonight. [Monty] So, how's it looking? [Julia] Good. Good. I think we're gonna do well. [Monty] Mmm. Come on. I'll walk you to your car. Thank you. Mm-hmm. You know what? I forgot. I let my driver go home early. Oh, well, you know, I'll take you home. Thank you. Is this how you're spending your birthday? - It's just another day. - Wow. How old are you? - You don't ask a woman that. - I just did. How old are you? - How old are you? - Thirty-four. 20-12. Oh, ho, ho, ho. Okay. Happy birthday. So, what you going home to do? Oh, I got some paperwork I gotta catch up on. Stuff like that. [chuckles] I mean, that ain't how you're supposed to spend your birthday. You need to get out and have some fun. [laughs] What's fun? I don't even know what that is. All I do is work. Fun is where you make it. Come on, I want to show you some fun. [People talking, laughing] You know, I don't think this is gonna be a good idea. Sure it is. Is it safe? [chuckles] You're always safe with me. Come on. Come on. - [man] Monty! - [man 2] What's up, baby? [man 3] What's happening, dawg?

Excuse me. Coffee, ma'am? Uh, yes. Decaf, please. Thanks. - Um... - [both laugh] What? Oh, hell, no. What are you talking about? Only good sex can make you smile like that. - Who is he? - We did not have sex. But there's someone. Oh. Thanks. - You're glowing. - Who is it? Come on, give up the goods, girl. - What was... - No. No. No. Because you're just gonna judge me, 'cause you two are judgmental. Oh, God. Is he married? He's not married. I'm not a hooker. - Oh, well, then who is he? - Then tell us. Come on. His name is Monty. - Monty. - Monty. Oh. That guy you introduced us to. He's the new associate. - He was so fine. He had... - No, no, no, no. - His name was Brian. - How do you know his name? You know, he's, he's not an associate. Do we know him? - Monty. - Monty. Do... come on. We know him. We know him. Monty. The driver? The driver? The driver? The driver? Oh, hell, no. Are you out of your mind? Okay, he's supposed to be driving you, not you riding him. Wasn't it you two ladies who told me, "Relax your standards, Julia"? Yeah, to relax them, honey, not lay them down by the riverside. I don't know about this. Where does he live? Edgewood. [together] Edgewood? - Edgewood. - Edgewood? What does your Ivy League background know about Edgewood? Nothing. And what do you know about Edgewood? Nothing. What could you two possibly have to talk about? They ain't gonna be talking. - Cynthia. - What? Your client's last settlement, his baby-mamma drama. - How do you know he has kids? - Because. Are you kidding me? It's not if he has kids, it's how many. - Does he have kids? - How many? - Three. - He has three children? I'm so disappointed. Are they all by the same mother? No, probably not. Yes, they all have the same mother, I think. But it doesn't matter. Just be careful. Don't fall for this guy, I'm telling you. He will run up your credit, have you in the swats wearing knock-off Gucci... - Brenda. - What? Relax, all right? She's not married. She's just having fun. Right? You're having fun. You're not falling in love. And she needs to have some fun. Girl, you need to take the edge off. Oh, you do. - Shall we? - Whoa. - Hey. Hey. - You all right? - Feeling good? - Yeah, yeah. You have fun last night except for the... [imitates retching] [chuckles] Yeah, I'm fine. Uh... What are you doing here? Well, you know, I just thought I'd come check up on you. And I realize, you know, you're doing all this work, but you haven't met the girls. I have them tonight, so maybe you want to come by and meet 'em. Great. Sounds good. All right. My place ain't as fly as yours, But, uh, how's seven o'clock? That sounds great. That's great. What's wrong with you? You still feel sick? [chuckles] No. [knock at door] Maya, do you knock? Well, I thought I did. I have the files you asked for. Great. Okay, thank you. I'll get those later. Thank you, Maya. - Will you just... - Thank you. [Maya] I... What is wrong with you? I thought we agreed that we would work after hours. Oh. Oh. I'm... I'm sorry. You know, you can't just come up to my office. You know, it's a lot of, there's a lot of nosy people and... My bad. You know, I just thought last night me and you... No, no. I mean, well, I hope you're not offended. No, I should have called you. - You understand, right? - Yeah. - Great. Okay. - All right, cool. - Great. - All right. - Thanks. - So, yeah. Okay. - You look good. - Thank you for that. Damn it. [sighs] Mmm. So, your dad went to go get dinner? Yes. Is it, um, is it far? Maybe. So, you have to be... Don't come up in here like you know us. [Lauryn] Oh, goodness. I'm Lauryn. And these are my sisters, Sierra and China. Where you meet my daddy at? We met at work. I think you guys saw me in court the other day. - Remember? - Oh, court? That was you? Yeah. [chuckles] Hey, you look so much older. Mmm. What did you say your name was again? Julia. Ain't that a white-girl name? Okay, now, we're supposed to be nice. - China. - And say thank you for helping my dad try to get custody of us. Oh, it's no problem, really. Well, you could try a little harder. I been having migraines since I been living there. - Migraines. - Bad migraines. - I'm sorry. I'm trying. - Really bad. - Hey. - Hey. - You made it. - Yeah. - Hey, daddy. - Uh-huh. Uh-huh. Well, yeah, your kids are certainly gonna be lawyers 'cause they sure as heck grilled the hell out of me. I bet they did. Hi, girls. Whatcha doing? [all] Nothing. And she's at school, but she is not a nice girl at all. - No? - No. Are you a nice lady? I try to be. I like your hair. Don't you, C.C.? It's all right. - Looks like a weave to me. - [coughs] No, it's not! - [Monty] Sierra. - What? So rude. - So rude. - Are you okay, Daddy? No, I think it's time for you all to go to bed. No. No, please. - Not yet. - Just five more minutes. - Not yet. - Good night. - No. - Please. - I want to talk to Ms. Julia. - Say good night. Good night, Ms. Julia. Good night. Good night. Sierra? Bye. Bye. [Julia] Tell me what you know. You know what? I'll tell you what I do know. I know that you, you're feeling me. But you won't let yourself go there because you, you care more about what people think than your own happiness. Am I right? We can both act like, you know, the other night never happened, but we both know it did. I was drunk. - No, no. - No, I was drunk. You was being yourself, and like my momma used to say, God rest her soul, a drunk man never tells no tales. What? - Touche. - Yeah. So, your mom passed? Yeah. My mom passed. I'm sorry to hear that. - What about your dad? - Who? - Your dad. - My dad. I don't know my dad. I got a whole bunch of brothers and sisters that I don't know, but that's cool. It's funny how life works out. You never knew your dad, but my dad would have killed for a boy. - For a boy. - For a boy. - Didn't get one. - I know the feeling. That man pushed me so hard. God. [sighs] Well, I made partner in the firm before I was 28. My parents retired to south beach. I don't know, Ms. Julia. You know what? You and I, we come from two different worlds, but, well, there's something going on here, right? - You want me to stop? - No. - No? - No. Oh, you on time today. Well, you know, I gotta... Oh, my God. What happened to you? Oh, some thugs tried to break in here. I fought them out. Before that happened, one of them cut me. - Are you all right? - Yeah, yeah. I'm all right. Well, did you catch 'em? It was just some, some crackhead trying to get some stuff. [sighs] Now, I'm getting too old for this, man. I'm tired of it. They win. You know, I was thinking, I gotta get rid of this place. I gotta leave this neighborhood. So, if you could get together what you can for a down payment, and then you hit me up once a month until we reach ten, plus interest, you can have this place. Would you do that? I mean, sure. What are you, what are you saying? You serious, man? Yeah. This place is officially yours. Wow. I mean, I didn't want it like this. No. Me neither. You'll have to... You gotta let me come back and help you from time to time. [chuckles] Any time you're ready, man. All right. Oh, man. [grunts] Congratulations. Is he gonna be all right? He'll be fine. [Monty] You see that? Huh? [Laughs] Wow, Daddy, look. Oh, wow, wow, wow. I see it. Oh, look at that. - Do you see it, Ms. Julia? - I do. - Yeah. - Wow. So, you know, I'm mad excited. I'm gonna get my sign for my new garage. - I know. - I know. - Sounds great. - I know. I'm really excited about that. - Congratulations. - Mm-hmm. Julia? - Hey. - Hey. What are you doing here? - Nothing, we were just... - I'm Monty. I remember you. Okay. Can I talk to you for a sec? Yeah. What are you doing with this man? - Look, we're just hanging out. - Are you serious? You like him? He's a nice guy. Snap out of it, Julia. You are a partner at your firm. The only black woman at that level. What do you think your partners would think if they knew you were sleeping around with the help? Are you trying to ruin your life? [man] Whoa, whoa. - Hey, Julia. How you doing? - Good. How you doing? - Hey, baby, you ready? - Yeah. [scoffs] Come on, guys. I think there'll be some people who are disappointed in me about this. I mean, you know who I am. I'm, I'm from the streets. - I can't change that. - I'm not trying to change you. - Do I embarrass you? - No. I mean, it's obvious that I do, and that's okay. That's okay. You just gotta tell me that. Tell me the truth, so that way, I know how to deal with it. Look, I don't, I don't know how I feel. Okay? But I can't sit here and lie to you and say that I don't think about who you are and what you have. I do. You have three daughters. One of whom is almost as big as I am. This is new for me, Monty, and it's different, and I'm trying. I am trying, and you gotta give me credit for that. Can we finish this conversation? Come on. - No. - No? What do you... what... I got my girls for, like, two more hours, and I'm not gonna waste my time dealing with this. But I will tell you something. - You don't have three girls in your life, just you. - Monty. Monty. - Monty. - Big guy, ain't he? - He's pretty. - Ain't he? A lot of them are. - Look at that one. - Look at that one. He's bigger than all of them. Yeah. No, he did not bring this chick to my house either. Watch the seatbelt. - Okay, Daddy. - Come on. All right? See you later. [Jennifer] Come on. Y'all, hurry up. Bye, Ms. Julia. All right. Oh, what? Come on. - I love you. - You, too. Now, be good, all right? - [Jennifer] Come on, y'all. - My butterfly. Go ahead. Come on, y'all. Hurry up. Shoot, I been standing out here all night, and I'm tired, too. Y'all think y'all the only ones tired? Shoot, and y'all... Just let me explain, Monty. The last man that I loved, he hurt me to my soul. We were together six years, and, he told me it was over two days before his wedding. I trusted him with everything. And I've never felt so low and stupid and humiliated in my life. And so I told myself not to think about you. But I couldn't, 'cause I do all the time. So, what are you saying? I'm saying that I've been running from something that already happened, and I'm saying that I fell in love with you, Monty James, And I'm saying that I hope I'm not in this alone. You're not. You're not alone. Come here. Your Honor, the children's own grandmother, their maternal grandmother at that, went down to child welfare and prepared a written statement as to why the children should be placed with their father. Let me see that. Did you know about this? [Jennifer] Oh, I don't know nothing about this. I don't know what they trying to pull now. Your Honor, my client has the means to take care of these girls, and she wants to take care... It says here that her mother thought the means were ill-gotten. Well, that's... that's pure... [judge] What do you do for living, Ms. Jackson? Well, I... well, I don't work, Your Honor. But my boyfriend does. What does he do? Well, he, you know, I mean, he owns his own businesses. [judge] And where are the tax returns? Well, you know, we was working on getting 'em, and you know what, Your Honor? You keep asking me about my stuff. You need to be asking Monty about some of his secrets, 'cause he got a whole lot of 'em. What is she talking about? [lawyer] Your Honor, Mr. James was convicted of the rape of a 16-year-old girl 16 years ago, and we're afraid for the safety of the children. Counselor, what do you have to say about this? Um... I wasn't aware, Your Honor. [lawyer] It's right here in black and white. Yeah, he was sentenced to eight years, has been on probation ever since his release. I'll take this matter under advisement. I need to review the circumstances of this case. Adjourned. So, how long has he been screwing you, huh? 'Cause I know he can't afford you. - Move. - Hey. - Move. - Hey, hey, hey, hey. I'll have to tap that ass. Let me explain. Let me explain something. - Get away from me. - Hold on. Hold on. Let me... - Get your hands off of me! - Wait, let me explain. - You know what? Shut up! - Shut the hell up! I can't even stand to look at you right now. I asked you if there were any surprises. You said no. You're a rapist. You don't think that's something I should have known about? - Julia, let me... - Don't you touch me! Julia, look, look. Look... Let me ask you a question. Did you or did you not go to jail for rape? - Julia, look... - Did you go to jail... - Julia, look! - Did you go to jail for rape, Monty? - Yes. - That's all I need to know. - No, I... - You know what? It doesn't even matter 'cause you're a liar, Monty. You're a filthy, God, you're filthy liar. This case is over. Maya will call you and tell you when to return for the ruling. You don't need me any more, Monty, And I certainly don't need you. So, you like him that much? - I fell in love with him. - Oh, Julia. Sweetie, this was supposed to be a fun thing, not a love thing. I know. Go ahead, Bren. Tell me I told you so. Oh, girl, you know I'm not gonna do that. It's just good that you found out now. I'm with Brenda on this. Julia, this guy was probably just after your money. He wasn't even like that. You know, you guys, he was a hard worker. You know, I mean, and he treated, God, he treats those girls like they are princesses. Well, let's not forget he has a record. [scoffs] How'd I not know he was lying? Because he's probably really good at it. They all are. It's like I'm, I'm hearing it, you guys, and I'm trying to understand, but I just... it... it doesn't make sense. You know? And I can't make my brain believe that it was all a lie. Is it as bad as it sounds? Honey, it's as bad as it sounds. [sobs] Jules, just... Do yourself a favor. Forget about this guy. He sounds like a lot of trouble. Okay? I just want to say... It was like a... [automated voice] Hi, this is Julia. Leave a message. [beep] [knock at door] Who that? [knocking continues] What you all doing here? Come on in here. What you all doing here? Huh? Where your mama at? What happened, C.C.? What happened? Huh? Huh? Daddy, we don't really care what the judge says. We just want to be with you. I'm staying here. - How did y'all get here? - We walked. Y'all walked at three o'clock in the morning? We can't stay there anymore, Dad. I'm sorry. What you talking... - Daddy? - What happened? Joe... Joe what? C.C., you can talk to me. You tell me what, what happened? - Joe keeps... - He keeps what? Joe keeps hitting China. What? Where? Come here. Where? - On my back. - On your back? And mama was sitting right there. She didn't even say anything. He beat me because... He hit... hold on. Hold on a second. Come here. He hit you? Hmm? He hit me because I wouldn't stop crying. Okay. Daddy, I was so sad. I couldn't help it. Okay, come here. Come here. We... We gonna... Grandma told me, Grandma told me to look after you all. I gotta look after you all. Mmm? So, y'all gonna stay with me now. Y'all gonna stay with me now, okay? Okay? C.C., I'm so sorry. I am so sorry. Okay. You're gonna stay with me. It's gonna be all right. [laughing] It's gonna be all right. [door opens] [sobs] [horn honks] [dog barking] [sobs] [man] Ah. Wait. Hold up. Monty. Monty! Man, come on! There's some girls over here, man! Monty, what are you doing, man? Come on! What's taking you so long. - [Monty] I'm Monty. - We know who you are. You beat our team. - How old are you? - Eighteen. You know, this sure is a nice place you have here. Um, you want to see my room? - [Monty] Sure. - [girl] So, you gonna call me? [Monty] Probably not. Oh, you're just like all the other guys. Mandy, what are you doing? Did he force you? - [Monty] No way! Tell him! - Mandy? - Yes, Daddy. - What? Sir, I didn't do anything. - Shut up! - I didn't do anything. Shut up! - It was her idea. - Shut up, superstar! - Tell him! - Call the police. I didn't do anything. Tell him, Amanda. If you don't tell him the truth, I'm going to jail. Tell him the truth! Your ball days are over! You got me? - I didn't do nothing! - Shut up right now! [echoing voices] [Julia] Get your hands off of me. I can't even stand to look at you. You're a rapist! [echoing] You're a rapist! You're a rapist! [engine starts] [tires screech] [Jennifer] I bet you he won't ever take our money again. [Joe] I know that's right. You gotta keep 'em straight, J. You know I got your back, right, baby? That's why you my girl. You know, I want to go see that movie with the dude with the ax, no, no, no, it's the chainsaw. Baby, you know, if we went to see that movie... [screaming] [panting] [clamoring voices] Check it out. Oh, snap! Load up! Load up! [clamoring] Do something! - [screaming] - Get out. [sirens] [newscaster] Tthere was a near-riot today in the Edgewood community. Police officers were called in to break up a fight between local gang members and residents who had had enough. Among those arrested was Monty James. You may remember Monty James, a high school basketball star who was falsely convicted in 1990 for allegedly having non-consensual sex with a 17-year-old girl... I'm assuming you have admissible evidence this time? Yes, Your Honor. The police seized several pounds of marijuana hidden in the defendant's vehicle. A subsequent search of the residence turned up several kilograms of crack cocaine. This time, Your Honor, we have a valid warrant. Your Honor, even though they served the search warrant, they still have no witnesses. [clears throat] Your Honor, I'll testify. Righteous mother... Congratulations! It looks like you have a case. Take them into custody. There will be no bond. - Next case. - Wait, get your hand off me! [bailiff] The state of Georgia versus Monty James. [cheering] Order! Order in this court! All of you, be quiet! Or I'll have you removed! I will have order! [banging gavel] Order! Order! I said order! Who's here for the defense? I am, Your Honor. Ms. Rossmore? May I take a second, please? What you doing here? I'm sorry. I didn't give you a chance to explain, and if you don't ever want to speak to me again, I completely understand. Let me help you. Monty, just let me help you. Just get me back to my kids. Ms. Rossmore? Your Honor, there's no evidence my client committed any criminal act. The state has no case against him. We demand a preliminary hearing and request the state be required to show probable cause. Your Honor, I'm sure that one of these witnesses can attest to the fact that Mr. James drove his vehicle into the previous defendant's vehicle. It was an accident. I'm sure that the subsequent fistfight was an accident also then, counselor. Where are the witnesses? Your Honor, the entire neighborhood saw this. I'm sure we have a witness. May I have one of the witnesses. Please stand at this time? - Your Honor... - I'm dismissing the case. [bangs gavel] [cheering] I love you. And I'm sorry for everything. [cheering] [Monty] Oh, man! Forget about it! I can't believe this! Yo! The whole neighborhood! [alll] Daddy! Come here. Come here, baby. [chanting "Monty"] - It's all you now, boy. - I love you, man. I appreciate it. Bye, babies.
