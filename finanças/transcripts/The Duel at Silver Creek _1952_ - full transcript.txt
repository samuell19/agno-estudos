For some time, there had been reports about a vicious gang of claim jumpers who'd been forcing miners to sign away their claims through fear of torture or death. The claims were then transferred to one of their own men, or were sold to innocent miners who had just arrived in the territory and were looking for new claims to work. These claims jumpers were smart enough not to try to grab some of the bigger mines, where there might be enough men working to put up a fight. Usually they picked on the claims being worked by one or two men. And the more defenseless these men were, the better the claim jumpers liked it. Their plan was simple and foolproof... ...because no one knew who they were. Since their victims either disappeared or were found dead, there wasn't anyone who could put their finger on these jumpers. Working a claim became a mighty dangerous business for any miner, because no one knew when or where they'd turn up next. Hey, Luke, come here, quick! Take a look at this. There's enough dust there to blind a man. Looks like we staked one with some pay dirt this time, son. It's about time we did, hard as we been working. Now you can buy all the silver you want. You won't have to go around playing poker for it. I like to play, Dad. You never figure on losing, do you, son? Well, if you figured on losing, you wouldn't be a poker player. We must have better than three ounces here. You take it to town and get it on the scale before the assayer closes down for the day. I bet you there's closer to five. Ha, that sure ain't gonna make me mad. He's getting ready to move out. Bill, Lenny, take care of him. I'll wait supper for you. But don't go getting in no poker game, or it'll be breakfast time before you get back. If I do play, I promise to win as fast as I can. Hi. Howdy. Any luck? Oh, there's lots richer pickings around, I guess. Well, than you won't mind signing over your claim. For how much? Let's say one dollar. Just to make it legal. What are you up to anyway? Now, get off of my land before I-- Now look, you're gonna sign. Why don't you make it easy on yourself? I'm not signing anything. Change your mind? I told you, I'm not signing-- Maybe you'd like to sign now. Maybe we're wasting our time, boss. That's what I was thinking. You know, this mine is no good to you if you're dead. What do we do with him now, boss? Get him out of here. We'll dump him in the arroyo. What's holding up those guys? Here comes Bill now. That's not Bill-- leave him, leave him, get moving! Then old man Tompkins struck it rich a few miles north of Silver City and the jumpers moved in and killed him. As usual they made a clean getaway. But this time they left a trail I thought we could follow. And as I was marshal of Silver City, I decided to get up a posse to track them down. Lightning! How about letting me hold down the marshal job while you're out hunting them claim jumpers? I don't know, Dan, I'm afraid there wouldn't be a man left in town without a hole in his skin with a famous old gunfighter like you on the job. Are you meaning to say, that I'm not as fast on the draw as you are? I'm meaning nothing of the sort. Well, you should, 'cause it's the truth. Even if I did teach you everything you know about a gun, ever since you was big enough to pull a trigger. But I'm older now, mite slower on the draw. Only a mite, Pop. The way I figure it, you've already tamed most of these itchy-fingered hotheads around here to where I can ride herd on them until you get back. All right, Pop, go into the office and get one of those deputy badges. Thank you, son. I knew you'd say that so... I already took one. Don't you worry about a thing while you're gone. Lightning! Well, is that sack for me to bring back the claim jumper's scalps in? - Unh-unh, smoked venison. - Oh. Might be gone for a long time. Might at that-- thanks, Dusty. You take care of me better than many a wife I know of. Johnny Sombrero looks mighty happy about something. Maybe it's because the marshal's leaving Silver City. Hey, Johnny Sombrero! How about joining the posse, Johnny? Give you a chance to use that shooting iron legal for a change. My gal don't want me to leave town. Which gal? All of them good-looking, female gals. They say should something happen to Johnny Sombrero, their hearts would break. Don't you go looking at me when you say that. If anything was to happen to you, Johnny Sombrero, I'd say good riddance. Just don't go bothering Dusty while I'm gone, understand? Didn't know it was a marshal's job to tell a fellow what females he can interest himself in. In this case I'm making it my job. Of course, if you hold another opinion, you're welcome to try to do something about it, right now. Think I'd be loony enough to draw on you, Marshal? No. Not while I'm looking at you. I'm glad Johnny ain't going with you, Lightning. Be easy for him to put a bullet in your back. It's a wonder he passed up the chance. Maybe he's got something else in mind. We're ready to move out, Marshal! Bye, Dusty. All right, let's go! Get going, get going! Hey, there's a posse coming! - How many? - About 20 of them! Clear out! The posse lost them in the chase. They tried to pick up the trail again, but had no luck. We were near Fort Lowell when I took the bullet through my right shoulder. So they dropped me off at the army hospital there, and they went back to Silver City. That's not very good for a marshal, is it? I could do better with my left foot. Sometimes it feels like it doesn't even belong to me. How much longer do I have to hang around here, Doc? Well, let's have a look. Hmm... mm-hmm. Well, it's seems to be healing nicely. I'll take the bandage off by the end of the week. Oh, good. Ooh. Does that hurt? No, not really, it's just a little stiff. Well, it may be for a while, just keep massaging it. Sheriff's coming! Who's that on the horse? Looks like O'Connor to me. Who you got there, Sheriff? Tom Peters. Claim jumpers did it, left him for dead. I hope the doc can pull him around. Must have been shot in the back. His back is all blood. Found him lying at the edge of Coyote Springs, more dead than alive. Get him inside. Do what you can for him, will you, Doc? He saw the claim jumpers. Told me he could recognize them, then he passed out. Be a mighty handy man to have alive. He'll be the first living witness we've ever had. Easy, easy with him. Thank you, boys. Excuse me, ma'am. Perhaps I could be of some help. I've had some training as a nurse. If there's one thing I need around here, it's help. All right. Make him as comfortable as you can. I have to probe for the bullets. Sure hope we can save that poor devil, Doc. Would you get me some water, please? Oh, sure. He's dead. I'll tell the sheriff. I guess he was farther gone than I thought. I'm sorry for what happened. I know how much he would have meant to you and the sheriff, had he lived. It was kind of you to help, Miss-- or is it Missus? Miss. Miss Opal Lacy. And you're the famous Marshal Tyrone of Silver City, aren't you? Famous is a pretty big word. I'm afraid most people call me a lot of other things. I heard you were wounded. I hope it's nothing serious, Mr. Tyrone. Mr. Tyrone. My friends call me-- I know, Lightning. I heard all about how fast you are with a gun. As a matter of fact, I know quite a bit about you. And I don't know anything about you. Isn't that a bit one-sided, Miss Lacy? My friends call me Opal. Well, they can't be very friendly then. If I knew you real well, I'd call you... I'd call you Brown Eyes. Brown Eyes? I like that. When are you returning to Silver City? Oh, just as soon as I can get this arm out of this sling. I hope it'll be soon. I'm on my way there now to join my brother. You did say your brother? Yes. He's a mining engineer. He's just opened an office in Silver City. Oh. Let's get on, folks. I hope you'll visit me in Silver City. Brown Eyes, I'm afraid you're gonna find me a nuisance when I get back. Why? Because I'm going to be sitting on your doorstep every spare minute I get. In that case, I'll make certain my house has a doorstep. Bye-bye. Bye. Good evening, Zack, good evening, Harry. Hello, Pop. - Good evening, Dave. - Hiya, hiya. Evening, Dan. Ah, evening, Tim. How's Lightning getting along? Well, of course he can't hardly wait to get home. But that doctor over at Fort Lowell won't let him travel none till his wound's all healed. I got a letter from him just this noon. - Who read it to ya, Pop? - Dusty. Why, you spavving cayoots... are you trying to say that I can't read? Oh, of course not Pop, it's-- Well, it's just that your eyes ain't as good as they used to be. Well, maybe they're not so good for reading. But they're still good enough for shooting. Oh, now, don't get mad, Pop. I know you're still plenty quick with a gun. Well, just so you don't forget it. Ah... Good night. Good night, Dan. Good night, boys. - Night. - Night. Good night, good night. You know that old galoot still thinks he can draw. The only thing he can draw is a picture. Shot in the back! He drew all right, but he never a chance. Whoever did this sure picked a perfect night. We'll never be able to find his tracks in the rain. I wonder what Lightning'll do when he hears about this? Well, I'd sure hate to be the guy that plugged him. Hiya, Lightning, how you feeling? Fine, thanks, just fine. Hiya, Will! Glad to see you back, Lightning. Hi, Dusty. Pa, Pa! Lightning's back! Hello, Pete. Pa and me's been worried sick since we heard you took a bullet. All that worrying is gonna make you old before your time, Dusty. How are you? How is your arm? Ah, good as ever. How's Dan been behaving himself? What's the matter? Pop's all right, isn't he? He was found dead, shot in the back. Shot? When? Three days ago. I'm sorry, Lightning. I know how much you thought of Pop. Who did it? Nobody knows. Happened out in front of the Blue Goose at night. Oh, that's great. That's just great. Pop gets shot in the back, and nobody makes a move to find out who killed him. Well, the rain was piling down when it happened, washed all the signs out from around his body. Yeah, whoever did it must have been desperate for money. They took the gold nugget off'n him. I think I'll have a talk with Johnny Sombrero. Funny thing about Johnny. Up and got himself a steady job right after you left. Nobody can prove he had anything to do with it. Maybe I can. Lightning? Johnny's been talking big since word got around you were wounded. He figures it's bound to have slowed you down. I never had much respect for Johnny's figuring. I hoped I'd still have the Indian sign on Johnny. Sure I could draw as fast as ever, but I couldn't squeeze the trigger. But Pop had been killed and I had a feeling Johnny'd done it, and I had to find out... now. That's him now. Who killed Dan Muzik? Why ask me? I guess he couldn't find his gun. He didn't have a chance to find it. He was shot in the back-- where were you? I was five miles out working as a guide for the Acme Mines. That's their office. I'll check that, and if you're lying to me-- You don't think I'd lie to you, do you, Marshal? I wouldn't advise it, unless you're thinking that bullet I took slowed my draw. Has it? There's a sure way to find out. Uh-uh, I've reformed. But my friend here hasn't. His name's Blake from Tombstone, and he don't like marshals. Maybe there's a good reason why you don't like marshals. None of them live long enough for us to get acquainted. You've been meeting the wrong kind of marshals. I don't think I have. I told you the marshal was a mighty sudden gent. If you're in Silver City after sundown, Rat Face, I'll throw you in jail. - Here! - Not now! Excuse me, can you tell me who the, uh-- Well, Brown Eyes. Welcome home, Lightning. You working here? Not exactly, I'm just helping my brother. Oh, this is your brother's place, huh? Mm-hmm, he's inside. I'm glad to see that your arm is better. Well, thanks-- I'd, uh, I'd like to talk to your brother. Won't I do? Maybe you will at that. I'm here to find out if a Johnny Sombrero's working for this outfit. He is. Oh, this is my brother Rod. This the marshal of Silver City. So you're the famous Lightning. Heard a lot about you. Glad to know you. What do you want to know about Johnny Sombrero? I want to know how long he's been with you. I put him on the day after I got here. I needed a guide, he knows the country. Why, you got anything against him? Well, nothing I can prove. I just have a hunch he had something to do with the killing of Dan Muzik. Oh, he couldn't have. He was acting guide for me at the time of the shooting. Have you talked to the Silver Kid yet? Silver Kid? Never heard of him. Opal, you shouldn't repeat idle gossip. What gossip? She heard the Silver Kid could have done it because he rode into town the day before this, uh, Dan Muzik was shot. Silver Kid, huh? Thanks for telling me-- see you. Lightning? They say the Silver Kid is awfully fast with his guns. Thanks for the warning, Brown Eyes. I hope the Silver Kid is as fast as they say he is. We'll soon know. Nice-looking fella. Yes, he's attractive. Interested? Oh, don't be ridiculous. My only interest in him is to make certain he doesn't get in our way. Gimme a bottle. When did you get back into Silver Creek? Glad you dropped in, Lightning. I heard you come back. Sorry about old Dan. Do you know anything about a stranger called the Silver Kid? Not much, except I'd hate to tangle with him, even though he looks like he ain't dry behind the ears yet. Where can I find him? Where he usually is, over there. Doing all right for himself, too. He didn't have the face of a killer, but he had the cold, steel look of one. I noticed his hands were quick and sure. Betting 40. Your 40 and 40 back again. Calling. Three aces. Costs money to learn to play poker, kid. It sure does. Looks like it's gonna cost you plenty to learn, because three aces don't beat three trays and two deuces. When are you gonna start shaving, kid? When you buzzards learn to play poker, maybe. Talks like a man, don't he? Wears a couple of shooting irons, too. Well, I'll bet he's a real tough hombre when his ma's around to protect him. I wouldn't crowd too far if I was you, sheep dip. Sheep dip? Why you-- Thanks for the winnings, gents. I'll be back later. Better come with me. Let's see your pouch. What's the matter, you short of cash? Sit down. I hardly expected to come across Dan's nugget in the kid's pouch. But I wasn't going to overlook anything. The kid could have been cocky enough to carry it on him, if he was the one who plugged old Dan. A man I thought a heap of was shot in the back a few days ago. His name is Dan Muzik. There's some folks in town think you might have done it. What do you think? I'm asking you, Kid. I don't shoot men in the back, Marshal. Only time I draw is when I'm crowded. I didn't kill this Dan Muzik. Any more questions? Yeah, what's your name? And I, uh, don't mean Silver Kid. Cromwell, Luke Cromwell. Where you from? Santa Fe. Santa Fe, huh? Is that all? 'Cause I'm losing a lot of money sitting around here. Just a minute. I'm probably wasting my breath, but I'm gonna give you some advice. Get out of town pronto. Get yourself a job, and quit poker. Poker's a man's game. I can take care of myself. Oh, sure, I know you're fast with your guns. But sooner or later you'll meet a man who's faster or who doesn't fight square. Then you move to Boot Hill. No, you're bucking a sucker's game, kid, you can't beat it. I guess that's good advice Marshal, but I ain't taking it. Besides, how to handle a six-gun and poker is all I know. There is a way to stop them riding you when you play poker, kid. That I sure would like to hear. I wasn't interested in his poker. But I was interested in the way he handled a six-gun. An idea hit me. I needed a right hand, and he had the fastest one I ever saw. You like silver, don't you, Kid? They won't be so quick to ride you with that pinned to your jacket. What's the catch? No catch, I got my reasons-- two of 'em. One is to keep you out of trouble. The other is with you covering my back, I'll have a better chance at staying right side up till I square things for Dan Muzik. Pa wanted me to ask you if you-- Oh, Dusty, this is the Silver Kid. He's gonna be my new deputy. Kinda young to be a deputy, ain't he? He handles his guns like an old-timer. Any objections to me be being a deputy? None, so long as you ride protection on Lightning. That's just what I aim to do. Just be careful where you aim. Pa said for me to ask you to have supper with us. Oh, thanks Dusty, be glad to. Say, a deputy gets hungry to, you know? Oh, I think we can stretch vittles for one more. That your girl? Who, Dusty? She's like a kid sister. I've known her since the day she was born. She don't look at you like no kid sister. Oh, you're seeing things. Come on, let's get washed up. You can bunk there. Say, are you sure a deputy's allowed to play poker? Well, there's nothing in the regulations that says he can't. Why, you think of riding Lady Luck after supper? Yeah, if I'm half as lucky as you are, I'm bound to clean up. What do you mean by that? A wound like that's likely to put a man's shooting arm plum out of action. I always was a lucky hombre. Lightning? Well, hello. Care to have supper with me? - Tonight? - Yes. Oh, I wish you'd have asked me earlier. The Kid and I are invited to eat at Pete Fargo's. I must be losing my charm. Any time you lose your charm, Brown Eyes, I'll be glad to look for it. My brother is working late at the sales office. Well, why don't I come over right after supper? Good, I hated the thought of spending the evening alone. - Bye. - Bye. You're gonna get a belly ache eating that fast. Oh, me? I always eat fast. Yeah, especially when there's a fancy filly sitting all alone waiting for him to come over. What filly? The one they call Miss Lacy, but, uh, he calls Brown Eyes. The only thing bigger than your ears, Kid, is your mouth. Gonna see her after supper? Her brother's working late. She's kinda scared to be alone. You sure that's in the line of duty, Marshal? Look, kid, your job is to see that I don't get a bullet in the back. That's all, understand? You stuck on that filly? Dusty, you got no right to call that lady a filly. Ha! Seems to me she got no right to call that filly a lady. All right, that's enough. Good night. Good night. Oh, thanks for the supper, Dusty. It was a good supper. You know I've seen fancy dressers like her before. They can do more harm to a man sometimes than a pair of six-shooters. Anyway, I'm glad he didn't ask me to go with him. Why? Hmm, I'd rather stay here and talk to you. What about? Nothing, just talk. Talking's a waste of time, unless you're doing something else at the same time. Yeah? Like what, for instance? Oh, like, for instance, helping me wipe these dishes. Go on, put that apron around you and get busy. Now, just a minute, Dusty-- You ate, didn't you? Now wipe. You say one word about this to anybody, you won't be able to sit down for a week. You understand that? Now remember, he'll be coming out soon after Lacy goes in. So, be ready. I'll be waiting for him. And don't miss-- he never misses. Evidently you don't like cake. Oh, I always eat slow. Good, that means you'll spend more time here. I don't need an excuse to spend more time here. Remember what I said at Fort Lowell, that I'd be parking on your doorstep? Well, if you insist on the doorstep. Oh, no, I find this lots friendlier. So do I. Certainly friendlier than the way you stormed into my brother's office this afternoon. Brown Eyes, had I known you were there, I'd have been on my best behavior. But I had a lot on my mind, some quick decisions to make. Obviously. What do you mean by that? Well, making the Silver Kid your deputy, was not only a quick decision, but kind of a reckless one too, don't you think? Oh, there's nothing wrong with the Kid a little growing up won't cure. Isn't it dangerous to make him your deputy, particularly when he's suspected of the killing? Who, the Kid? Oh, no, he couldn't possibly have anything to do with it. Well, if you don't suspect him, then whom do you suspect? Johnny Sombrero. I just can't swallow his alibi. But Johnny was with my brother, they camped out all that night. Yeah, they were only five miles out. Johnny could have ridden into town and back again while your brother was sleeping. Or he could have put Blake up to it. Blake? Yeah, some trigger-happy kid, seems to be a sidekick of Johnny's. I'm sorry. I didn't mean to get into this kind of talk. Don't be sorry, I'm interested. Interested in me, or in what I do? Both. Well, I guess I've taken up enough of your time. Do you have to leave now? Well, no, I don't have to. I just don't want to wear out my welcome. You're welcome here anytime. Stay until my brother gets home. You know, I like your brother, especially when he's out. So do I. Well... Next time I'll stay at the office later. Next time I'll start earlier. I may have something to say about that. Good night. Good night, Lightning. You know, I have a hunch you two would like me to work late more often. Always play your hunches, Lacy. Good night. Lightning, you all right? Yeah! That you doing the shooting, Kid? Nah, some bushwhacker back there. I was a might slow bending my gun over his head, but here's his. Well, thanks for saving my hide, Kid. Let's take a look at him. Lightning, Lightning! The Kid just got himself a two-legged coyote. Who is he? His name is Blake. Rat Face suits him better. Is he dead? Come on, tell the lady you ain't dead, Rat Face. Come on, tell her! Get me to a doctor quick, you want me to die? You want me to answer that? Why did you want to plug me? Thought you were somebody else, I made a mistake. The same kind of mistake you made as when you killed Dan Muzik? You couldn't pin that killing on Johnny Sombrero, so now you want to pin it on me. Well, you can't do it, see, 'cause I didn't hit this stinking town-- Before I get through with you you'll be sorry you hit it at all. That half-wit. He had a clean shot at him and he missed. If the Silver Kid hadn't interfered, Blake would have gotten him. I could swear I've run into him before. You think Blake will talk? He won't. Well, you better make sure. Sitting in jail for a long time can sometimes loosen a man's tongue. He won't be in jail that long. You find anything? No. Well, it might help if you tell your deputy what you're looking for. When I find it, I'll tell you. Easy, Doc. There, that's the last stitch. If you'd have hit him harder you'd have saved me a lot of work. What are you doing? Quit tearing my shirt. Lightning, ever see one of these before? Yeah, the jumpers use these to identify themselves. - I know. - How do you know, Kid? Some time ago, me and my dad had a little claim up in the Tomahawks. One day some skunks forced my dad to sign over the claim and... then they shot him. I went after them and managed to get one of them before they shot my horse out from under me. One of them had a doodad like this around his dirty neck. Why did you kill Dan Muzik? Talk fast! I told you I didn't do it. How many more of the jumpers are with you? Never heard of 'em. Maybe a branding iron on his belly might jog his memory. There's another way to make him talk, worse than using a branding iron. I had a hunch that the jumpers would try to break Rat Face out of jail, or else fill him full of lead so he couldn't tell embarrassing things, like who their leader was. So we sneaked him to the ranch Pop had left me, where I picked up my foreman. I had in mind a cave that was just made to order for Rat Face. Yes, that oughta hold the little buzzard. This place stinks rattlesnakes. You ain't gonna leave me here, are you? Yeah, the rattlesnakes crawl in here kinda thick during the heat of the day. If a rattler bit you, he'd probably die. Ready to talk? This is your last chance, Rat Face. I ain't scared, and I ain't talking. Dave'll look in on you now and then to see if you're ready to talk. If I don't hear from him in 48 hours I'm passing the word around town where you're hidden. Folks in Silver City thought a heap of Dan Muzik. They'd like nothing better than to string up one of you claim jumpers. You ain't gonna lynch nobody, Marshal, I know too much. Besides lynching's against the law. So is shooting marshals in the back. Take 'em into the corral, Kid, Pete'll unsaddle 'em. Well, what do you think you're doing? Guarding the prisoner what ain't. Why? Doc Hargrove been talking? Talking to me. Everybody else still thinks you got Rat Face back there. Johnny Sombrero and Tinhorn are trying to whip up a lynching mob. I figure a couple of loads of buckshot oughta scatter them. Well, you scatter on home, Dusty. We'll take care of the guarding. Don't want a pretty gal like you getting all messed up. Know something, Lightning, that's the first time you ever admitted I was a gal. Know something, I must be real smart. I figured she was a gal the first time I ever saw her. Maybe you're smart enough to figure out who'll get here first tonight, the lynching mob or the jumpers? Maybe I can, but right now, I'm going to keep Dusty a little company. I figure there's no objections. Hey, Dusty! Mind if I walk you home? Thank you, and now you can walk yourself right back to Lightning-- he might need you. Oh, just brushing that chip off your shoulder. You know we're both holding the same cards. Maybe if you got your mind off poker once in a while, I might be able to understand you. Look, Dusty. Lightning's so blinded by Brown Eyes, he can't even see your shadow. You're so blinded by Lightning you can't even see mine. So it gives us something in common doesn't it? Same cards. Maybe I ought to learn to play poker better. What you ought to do is get out of this game. If you do, we both stand a chance of winning. If you don't, we both wind up holding dead hands. I better go inside. - Hi, Carl. - Hi. Here, this ought to blow it into the next county. What about the marshal and that kid he deputized? Johnny Sombrero will take care of them. Johnny's fixing it so the marshal will have his hands full at about the time you get there. Well, just so they're out of the way. You boys have nothing to worry about, just grab him and wait for us back here. Come on! Come on! I'll tell you what'll happen to him. He'll go to jail for a little while, and than he'll be free to take up where he left off. Johnny's right! Them claim jumpers go around killing with a free hand. What happens to them when they get caught? Why, they stick 'em in some nice, warm, comfortable jail. Yeah, well, it don't seem right to me to let a claim jumper off that easy. That's what I say. They're a bunch of murdering rats, the lot of them. If I had my way, they'd all hang. Why don't we string him up? We've been putting up with this thing long enough! Let's get him! Lightning! Lightning! There's a lynch mob coming after Blake. Remember, Kid, no shooting unless they start it. Please, Lightning, don't take any chances. If you can't talk them out of it, let them have Blake. Don't worry about me, Brown Eyes. Now get on home before they get here. Be careful. You can count on me, Lightning. That's close enough! You giving us Blake or do we bust in? How come you're in this, Johnny? Yesterday Blake was a friend of yours. That was yesterday. I didn't know then he was one of the jumpers. Now hand him over. I'm handing nobody over. Blake's done some talking-- at his trial he'll do plenty more. We'll hold a trial after we've strung him up. I'm warning you, Lightning, we're coming in! I got a load of buckshot waiting for you, Johnny! Opal told me you're in trouble. And Johnny's making the most of it. I don't hold with lawlessness, Johnny. I just want to give this jumper a piece of his own medicine. That's the marshal's job, not yours. Don't listen to him, Johnny. Shut up, Tinhorn. I got respect for what Mr. Lacy says. I'm stringing with him. Blake gets his neck stretched after the trial. Watch the walls! Those jumpers got Blake! We ought to go after them, Lightning. Ah, never find 'em in the dark. Too bad they got Blake. Outside of him, we wouldn't know who to look for anyway. See, Lightning? If you hadn't butted in, Blake would be dangling from a rope. Now he'll live to put a bullet in your back. That's enough, Johnny. The marshal was only doing his duty. Now go home and get some sleep before you get in trouble. Yeah, that goes for all of you. Anything you say, Mr. Lacy. Come on, Tinhorn. We'll get some boys together in the morning and see if we can't follow their tracks. Good idea. I appreciate the way you backed me up, Rod. I would have been in hot water with Opal if I hadn't. Good night. Good night. One of them will be riding high and wide, but not handsome. I put a load of buckshot into his britches. Oh, thanks, Dusty, whenever I need another deputy, I won't have far to look. Say, I don't know if I'd interest myself in a gal that can shoot like that or not. Likely spend the rest of my life picking buckshot out of my hide. You know, Lightning, some folks are gonna hold you to blame for letting that jumper get away. Oh, the jumpers didn't get Blake-- Shh, Dusty. What's going on around here? You sat out there and saw them do it. That's what comes for letting a gal in on a secret. Yeah. Well, she held it longer than most of them would have. What are you two talking about? Dusty's right, Pete, the jumpers didn't rescue Blake. The Kid and I have him cached out at the ranch. Well, you picked yourself a right smart young deputy. That's what I've been trying to tell him. Well, I'll be-- Come on, Dusty. See you in the morning. - Good night. - Good night. - Night. - Good night. Tell me, how does it feel to have yourself a right smart young deputy? I'll let you know as soon as I get one. Come on, Kid, let's clean this mess up. Here comes the boss now. You boys all right? Sure, all but Slim here, he'll be riding standing up for a while. Where's Blake? That's what we'd like to know. We bust in this jail and it's empty. Empty? But Lightning put him in jail. Lightning said he put him in jail. Well then, where is Blake? Hidden somewhere else. You boys get back to the hideout. You know something, I have a feeling Lightning would do most anything for me... or my brother. What are you getting at? Well, maybe if we use a little trick of our own, we can get him to turn Blake over to us. What sort of trick? Drive me back to the house, and I'll tell you about it... brother dear. I figured that sometime during the night, the jumpers might take a notion to sneak back, and try to force me to tell where Blake was hidden. So I wasn't taking any chances. I was going to be ready for them when they came. Lightning, you've got to help me. Some masked men broke into the house and they pistol-whipped Rod and then they kidnapped him! Did they hurt you? Did you recognize any of them, Miss Lacy? Well, if you were listening you'd heard her say they were masked. Well, they had hands, didn't they? Rings, fancy boots, maybe a black sombrero? I'll take you home and look around, see if the kidnappers left any trademarks. You stay here in case the jumpers take a notion to come back. The lamp is on the table. I'd like to look over Rod's room first. Through here. Rod must have put up quite a fight. He did but there were five of them. Any idea why they wanted to grab him? He never had any trouble that I know of. Maybe the jumpers are gonna try to force Rod to sign over his claim. But Rod hasn't filed any claims here. He was only interested in reopening the old silver mine at Santa Rita. You think they might have grabbed him for ransom? I, I don't know why they've taken him, Lightning, but... I'm afraid for him. I'm afraid. Go ahead and cry, if it makes you feel any better. Put your hands up. You wouldn't shoot your own deputy, would you? Oh, that was a smart stunt, I almost plugged you. Maybe I should have, might teach you to do as you're told. I figured I'd better tag along, just in case you might need me sort of accidental-like. From now on, I'll do the figuring. As long as you're here, search the rest of these downstairs rooms, and the grounds outside, and don't trample on any signs. You're the boss... boss. We'd better check your room. What's in there? My dressing room. Do you think you'll find Rod? I'll do everything I can, Brown Eyes. There's one fellow I'm going to check on as soon as I leave here. Who is that? Johnny Sombrero. But Johnny works for my brother. Why would he want to kidnap him? Oh, it doesn't make sense, Lightning. Sombrero does a lot of things that don't make sense. Try to get some sleep, Brown Eyes. Good night, Lightning. Good night, see you in the morning. Kid? How dare you come into my bedroom? You ought to be horsewhipped! I came out and found him here. I didn't know this filly was in here. I heard something so I came in to look around. Get out. I've taken all I'm going to take from you. You sure you know what you're doing? 'Cause you're not only blind, you're a cripple. What do you mean, cripple? Meaning you. I notice the way you've been massaging that right hand, when you think no one's watching. Go ahead, let me see you pull that trigger. You're through, get out. Go on, get out! Johnny Sombrero finds out about that, you won't have the Indian sign on him anymore, will you? He didn't take anything, did he? I don't know yet. No, here they are. I'm sorry. Thank you. They're fire opals, they're my birthstone. Please? Aren't they exciting? Like their owner. I really haven't had much practice at this. I'd be very jealous if you had, darling. You again! Found this on the door as I was leaving. I thought you mightbe interested. Is it about Rod? "Marshal, if you want Rod Lacy back alive, "you and Blake start for hideout-- he knows where. "On the way you'll be met and prisoners exchanged. Just you and Blake, no tricks, or Lacy gets it-- The Jumpers." But, that's not possible. Rod told me they'd rescued Blake. Oh, I've got Blake hidden away safe, I'm holding him till he tells who killed Dan Muzik. But Lightning, they'll kill Rod. Maybe I can get Rod, and still keep Rat Face. Well, good night, Brown Eyes. There was one more thing I had to do before making my plans. I wanted to find out if Johnny Sombrero was in town. Rat Face had been his friend, and he could be using Rod to make me turn Rat Face free. Hands off that gun, Johnny! How long you been in bed? Since right after you let Blake escape. Well, wiped nice and clean, huh? You take real good care of them, don't you, Johnny? Always-- they cost me plenty in Santa Fe, Where's Rod Lacy? Bed, I guess, where you ought to be. He was kidnapped about an hour ago. Mr. Lacy? Five men broke into his house and grabbed him. And you think I had a hand in it? You're crazy-- I work for Mr. Lacy. He's a friend of mine. So was Rat Face. Maybe this is your way of getting Rat Face back, huh? Even swap Rat Face for Rod? That your idea, Johnny? You're scratching in the wrong place. The only way to turn up worms is by scratching for 'em. If he was the one who put that note on the door of the Lacy house, his horse would still feel sweated. He was cool, I could tell he hadn't been run for hours. I began to think I was all wrong about Johnny Sombrero being mixed up in this. Made this batch a might stronger. Phew! Well, the stronger the better. Phew, smells like a skunk moved in! - Garlic water. - Garlic water? Yeah, a trick I learned from Dan Muzik. Rat Face is gonna ride this horse when Lightning takes him to the jumpers. I trade Rat Face for Lacy, then the posse turns some dogs loose and they follow the trail right to Rat Face and the jumpers. That way he figures to get them all. Kinda smart, huh? No, I don't think it's smart, I think it's crazy. Sure the posse gets the jumpers, but you and the Silver Kid get your bellies full of lead. Well, you can stop worrying about the Silver Kid. He's not going with me. Why not? I told him he was through. He kept bucking me at every turn. The kid's fixing to leave town, Dusty. He's getting his stuff together now. Got a message for you, Lightning, from Johnny Sombrero. He's waiting for you at the Blue Goose. Johnny drunk? He's just been listening. He's heard you've been riding bluff on him, that that jumper's bullet did things to your shooting hand. Oh, you can still draw plenty fast, but, uh, can't squeeze the trigger. Johnny aims to find out whether he's been hearing right. Tell Johnny I'll accommodate him. It's a pleasure. I, um, heard you was leaving. Well, you heard right. There's nothing left around here for me anyway. But you can't go now. Why not? Because Lightning's going out to meet the jumpers alone. What do you want me to do? Well, you've gotta try and stop him. Look, Dusty, there's one thing you ought to get straight. Lightning's not doing this for Dan Muzik. He's not doing it for Rod Lacy either. He's doing it for Brown Eyes. He wants to stick his neck out for her, let him. Me, I don't figure to stop no bullet 'cause he's stuck on that fancy filly. Maybe what you say is right, he is doing it for that Lacy woman, but you can't let him go alone, he's sure to get killed. That's too bad. It's too bad for you. But I warned you to get out of the game. I'm not in the game anymore. You were right. I just hope it isn't too late. You just couldn't wait to get even with me, could you? Why, you cheap little-- In just about one second I'm gonna forget you're crippled. Why didn't you forget it last night, instead of blabbing it all to Johnny Sombrero? I didn't say anything to anyone about your crippled hand. You're a liar. Johnny sent Tinhorn around to say he's waiting for me. Don't! Now, get out of town and keep traveling! You're not gonna meet Johnny, are you? I got no choice-- if I back down now I might as well turn in my badge and get out of Silver City. But if your hands are no good, Johnny'll kill you. I always had the Indian sign on Johnny. I think maybe I still got it. Maybe when he sees me call his bluff, he'll figure the Kid deliberately gave him a bum steer just to frame him. If that happens, he'll turn tail like he always did. But what if he don't turn tail? It's a chance I gotta take. Here he comes. I'm taking over for Lightning. Now, you'll be able to get back to Brown Eyes. Who killed Dan Muzik? Opal... she... wanted it. Talk sense, Johnny, you haven't much time. The, the nugget. Take a look... in her jewel box if you don't... believe me. You liar, you dirty liar! Who do you think told me you couldn't squeeze a trigger? Opal's been my gal right-- right along. Hurt bad, Lightning? Darnedest thing I've ever saw, shot by his own deputy. Here, let me tie this around it. I'm sorry I had you wrong, Kid. You didn't guess right on Brown Eyes either. Better let the doc have a look at it. The doc'll have to wait. I've got something to attend to first. Darling, you've been hurt-- Lightning, what are you doing? How did this get in here? It was Johnny Sombrero's. He gave it to me as a gift. A gift of his love for you, to prove he'd do anything you want, even if it meant shooting Dan Muzik in the back. What are you talking about? Well, you can stop playing me for a fool now, Brown Eyes. Oh, please, Lightning, you must believe me. I didn't know it was Muzik's-- how could I? Johnny didn't say where it came from, he only said it was a-- Oh, stop it-- Johnny Sombrero is dead, but he did a little talking first. Johnny dead? I'm clumsy with necklaces. I can't squeeze the trigger. You wanted him to kill me, didn't you-- didn't you? No, I didn't! Who ordered Sombrero to kill Muzik, you or your brother? Rod. But he isn't my brother. He gave me the things I had to have, the things I wanted-- money and clothes. When he wanted to control a man, I managed it for him. So that's it, huh? You and Rod are jumpers? That's putting it a little coarsely. Let's just say that we buy up all the jumpers' claims. But Rod's all through now. I don't have to take his orders anymore. I never did like him anyway, and you've been wanting me, darling. Trading post is closed, Brown Eyes. Lightning! Dusty lit off to deliver Rat Face. Why the little fool, they'll kill her. How long ago did she leave? About 20 minutes ago. We'll never catch up with her. I know a shortcut to the jumpers' hideout. - Where is it? - Near Silver Creek. But you'd better open up that trading post first, 'cause you'll never find it without me. I bet I can get it out of her. Stay away from me. Take us to the hideout and we'll let you go. All right, it's a deal. Round up some men. And remember, Brown Eyes, this time no tricks. We should have caught up with Dusty by now. Yeah, unless she's already there. It's Blake and a gal's brought him in. Hey, Lacy! Hiya, Dusty! Mr. Lacy! Oh, I'm so glad you're not hurt. I brought Blake in exchange for you. I appreciate that, Dusty. I sort of like it here. I think I'll hang around a while. How about getting these irons off of me, boss? Boss? That's right, Dusty. I'm much obliged to you for bringing Blake back. I'd like it better if Lightning had come along though. Posse coming! Get her inside, keep her there, quick! Their hideout is on the other side of those rocks. This is as far as I go. Just a minute, you're gonna take us in there. No, I made a deal-- let her go. How do we know she ain't lying? If she is, I'll find her and bring her back. Get going, Brown Eyes. Little double-crosser, she's bringing him in here! Keep down till you hear me fire! Bob, take two men up there. Jack, three men up high. Rest of you scatter! Now remember, don't shoot till I shoot. Opal! Rod! There's a posse coming! Yeah, and you brought 'em. But I came to warn you. No, Rod, don't, I love you! We're trapped, spread out! Hey, that's Dusty's horse! Aah! Come on, get on up to that trough there! Here they are, Marshal. Where's the Kid and Dusty? In there. Excuse me. Come here. I just thought, what is your name? Well, I can't go through life being called Mrs. Silver Kid. Luke Cromwell. Hello, Luke. Hold on. How about you? Dusty ain't no dignified name-- It's Jane. Hi, Jane. You again. We're set to pull out, Kid, so anytime you're ready.
