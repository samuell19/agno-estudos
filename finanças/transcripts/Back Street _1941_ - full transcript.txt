(rousing fanfare) (dramatic orchestral music) (sentimental music) (lively marching music) (horn honks) (motor backfires) (crowd laughs) [Onlooker] Get a horse! And that'll be 17.50 for the music and two dollars and a half for the push. You wouldn't take the machine instead, would you? (crowd laughs) Don't pay any attention to him. He's just like everybody else in this town. The same doggone thing, the wire to the sparker. I made a fine laughingstock out of you too, getting you to dress up. No, don't you worry about that. I like to dress up. I wouldn't blame you a bit if you were all put out. - But I'm not put out. - You couldn't help it. Anyway, I like to do things just for the excitement. Guess I'll be getting all my excitement from bicycles from now on. (chuckles) No, you won't. At least I can make a living at that. What's the fun of just making a living? Maybe if I just let this wire hang loose instead of tacking it along the frame. Aw, that's no good either. Then if it swings against the motor- - I thought you were going to stick to bicycles. - Ray? - Mm-hmm? Why don't you marry me and give me something else to worry about? Now, that sends me right home to the store. Oh, no. I didn't mean to ask you again. It just kinda slipped out. One of these days I'd like to say yes to you, just to see what you'd do. Why don't you? Oh, you'd be sorry if I did. No, Curt, if I ever do fall in love, it'd have to be all the way or nothing. That's the way I am. I pity the poor man. Oh, Ray? You're going to feel awfully silly when I remind you of these things the day we get married. (Ray laughs) Hello! I had the most wonderful ride. You looked like a queen with all those men in uniform pushing you. Haven't you tallied the buttons yet? No, we haven't. Things would go a whole lot faster for us, Fredda dear, if three pairs of busy hands had been doing their duty. I was only gone an hour. Of course, I'm only Ray's stepmother, Fredda. I don't expect her to pay any attention to what I say. Two cards of green, two of peach, one of white. We need another dozen white. You put them away and I'll call them. Oh, Mother. You didn't give Ray that message from the salesman. - What salesman? - Oh, that Mr. Porter. Telephoned and said that he had a big bargain for you. That must be the new silk braid. [Fredda] Yes, that was it. Of course, you'll have to go over to the hotel and meet him there if you want to see it. Yes, I'd better go then. Well, then we can finish the stock tomorrow. We'll go right on with our work, Fredda, and let your stepsister go on over to her sample room and waste her time with a lot of traveling drummers. They're friends of mine. Birds of a feather flock together. People are judged by the company they keep. They're a whole lot better company than anybody here. At least they don't whine and complain all day. I'm going over to meet Ed Porter and whoever else is there, and I'm going to sit around and talk to them. And if you think you're missing something, Mrs. Smith, why, just put on your hat and come along. Might make you a little bit more human. Oh no, Mr. Mason. Oh no, our price is not high. Now, I don't want to contact you, but you must remember, that garment is made with whalebone stays. And whalebone doesn't grow on trees, Mr. Mason. Do you know what we have to do to get whalebone? - No. - We have to send sturdy men in sailing vessels to the Arctic Circle, where the weather is 100 degrees below zero, and there they sit, on the ice, waiting for a whale to go by, and they harpoon him. And mister whale takes off like 60. He pulls them through icebergs and around the North Pole and through Alaska. And finally he plays out, then they tow him in. But they have to strip all that blubber off to get the whalebone. Then spring comes and the ice breaks, and they put the whalebone on a dogsled, the dogsled rushes to the railroad, the railroad rushes to us, and we rush it into that garment. And after all that toil and trouble and danger, all we asking is $37.50 a dozen, and you think the price is too high. It is, and I don't want any. Of course you don't want them, Mr. Mason, but the women do, yessiree Bob! And when you offer them that garment, you can say, "The finest merchandise in the world to the finest women in the world, our customers." Not a bad slogan. Course it isn't, and it's yours for a small order. "The finest merchandise in the world to the finest women in the world, my customers." Very good, Mr. Porter. Send over two dozen, assorted sizes. - Two dozen, assorted. - Thank you, Mr. Mason. Thank you, sir! (Laughs) That Mason is an easy mark. He'll buy anything! She just won two big pots for you. What about my new silk braid? If I don't come home with it, Mrs. Smith will suspect the worse. I'll get it for you. When the firm hears the price I'm making you on that braid, they'll think I've gone daffy. Send 'em a picture of Ray, then they'll understand. Probably give you another 10% off. If you up to New York, they might give it to you for nothing. How about it? I'm leaving Monday. Wanna go along for the ride? Ray never gets on trains. She just takes you to the depot and waves you goodbye. Who's talking about waving goodbye? Ray's taking me to the train tonight. I'm staying over until Sunday. Why don't we both wave 'em goodbye and then go out and kick up our heels, huh? You're pretty fresh for a Johnny Newcomer, aren't you? (laughs) I don't mean no harm. I just want to join the lodge. Better initiate him, Ray. Should we tell him about life, or let him find out for himself? Hey, Ray. Say goodbye to the gentleman. I want you to help me pack my trunk. Oh, all right. Deal me out, boys. Hey, wait a minute. Suppose I hire myself a very fancy rig and you and me go for a nice moonlight drive Sunday. Oh, wonderful! Be sure and call for me if there's a full moon by twelve o'clock. Noon. (crowd laughs) You'll have to get up pretty early to fool Ray Smith. Do you? Thanks for telling me. You want to be careful of that Harry. I don't like the way he talked to you about going to New York. He was just jollying me along. He's riffraff. Sells buggy whips. You know what kind of a fellow sells buggy whips. Calling on livery stables, hardware stores. I'm going to New York someday. But I'm going alone. That's a good notion. Do you good to get out of Cincinnata for a couple of days. You know, Ray, I'm gonna spend Sunday in Dayton. You wouldn't like to run over to Dayton, would you? I'll think about it. You always say you'll think about it, but you never do it. You know, Ray, I'm very fond of you. Now, here's what we could do. We could meet on the train. You buy your ticket as soon as you get to the station. No one will ever know. Just say you could... I didn't say anything. Just seems like I have to slap your face every time you come to town. It certainly does. I guess I'll never learn. You ought to be ashamed of yourself. Come on, hurry up! You're gonna miss your train. Maybe I just can't take no for an answer. That's what makes you such a good salesman. Yeah? But I always miss out on the good deals. Feel better now? (Ray giggles) (train bell clanging) That locomotive reminds me of your stepmother. I bet it'd be a whole lot more pleasant to live with. All the old girl needs is a bell and a cowcatcher. It's gonna be an awfully lonely trip to Dayton. I don't suppose you'd change your mind just for the... No. I guess you wouldn't, no. Well, I'll see you again when I get back this way. When will that be? This fall? Yeah, about the second week after Thanksgiving. Hello, Mr. Saxel. Hello there. Hello. How do you do? Fine, Mr. Saxel, fine. How's everything down in little old New Orleans? Very good. What are you doing up here in Cincy? Just stopping over a few hours. I'm going out on the Louisville boat tonight. Well, don't do anything I wouldn't do. Of course not! Certainly glad to have seen you again. Goodbye, Mr. Saxel. Goodbye, Ray. Oh! Your silk braid! Oh! Oh, I forgot! Mr. Saxel! I want you to meet a friend of mine, Ray Smith. Sweetest little peach in Cincinnata. Show him around, Ray! But look out for him! He's one of those Louisiana Frenchmen! (Laughs) - Bye! - Goodbye! Goodbye! You haven't the faintest idea who he is, have you? No idea. I know his face though. Ed Porter. Oh yes, from Mackleson and Fogerty in New York. You see, I may not remember faces, but I never forget names. - What's mine? - Yours? Well... Uh, he just told you. - Yes, I know he did. - (Ray giggles) Ah, Miss- Smith. - Smith. - Ray Smith. Oh, well, it's very difficult, "Ms. Smith." Go on, if you can't remember Smith, you can't remember anything. I'll try very hard never to forget it. Thank you. Goodbye, Mr. Saxel. Au revoir, Ms. Smith. - Porter, sir? - Yes. Sorry, Mr. Saxel, but you have my package. Oh yes, I know. I'll carry it for you. But you're not going my way. Oh yes, your way is the way I'm going. Now just a minute, Mr. Saxel- - Well, it's all very simple. How can I possibly have supper with you if you go one way and I go the other? That wouldn't be very amusing, would it? Nobody said I was going to have supper with you. Oh yes, your friend, Mister... - Porter. - Yes'm? The young lady wants to know if it's all right for her to have supper with me. Yes or no? Oh, yes sir! - You agree? - By all means, sir. But I have work to do back at the store. Work? Oh, you don't want to go back to work. No. No. (sentimental music) Do you always take young ladies you meet at railroad stations to supper? Always. It's a family custom. My father did the same thing. And my grandfather used to wait at the stagecoach stops, - and same thing. - Good evening, sir. I wonder why I came with you. They never know. For three generations, women have said to us, "Why did I come to have supper with you, Mr. Saxel?" [Ray] And what have you boys told them for three generations? - Nothing. - Nothing? Well, very little. Oh, I see. That's part of your family custom too, huh? Yes, of course. You Saxels sound very nice. And very mysterious. - Do we? - Mm-hmm. - And you Smiths? - Oh! Which wine will you have? The burgundy or the bordeaux, sir? Certainly. We Smiths are an open book. Everybody knows everything about the Smiths. - [Saxel] Oh no, not me. - Tell me something about them. Burgundy's better, but the bordeaux is more expensive. What's the matter? His whole family won't tell anybody anything, and he won't tell me... He gets the bordeaux and he likes it. You mean you took your pony into the classroom, the way Mary took her lamb? - I'm afraid I did. - Why? Well, I had seen an educated pony once in the circus, so I thought my pony should have an education too. When I was seven I wanted to drive a steam engine. Then I found out they didn't have lady engineers. We have beautiful duck a la citron and pheasant that will melt in your mouth. Bring it. Were you very disappointed? The duck or the pheasant, sir? Certainly. [Ray] No, because then I decided I'd become a sailor. - A sailor? - Mm-hmm. You see, I like storms. I love it when it gets dark and thunders and the lightning zigzags across the roof. Of course, I'm scared to death, but I love it. How about the pheasant, sir? Hmm? Hello. Oh, the pheasant. Oh, the most marvelous pheasant I've ever eaten. Thank you very much. When I was a boy, I wanted to be a pirate. [Ray] Oh, yes! That was another thing little girls couldn't be. Oh, I could never have moved from such a lovely house. [Saxel] You see, I'm working in a bank now. I have to live in the city. [Ray] I'd have stayed on the plantation and let them have their old bank. Ah, well. People want different things from life. What do you want? - What most men want. - Position, money, power. Oh, power. What's that anyway? Just to tell people what to do? My stepmother does that all the time. (chuckles) What do you want of life? Nothing. [Saxel] Aw. Everybody wants something. No, I don't. Oh, I'd like to be able to travel a little bit. I'd like to see all kinds of people. I'd like to work some place besides the store. I don't want anything. Well, we are very different. Of course we are. That's why I like to talk to you. Go on, tell me some more things. All right. We start when I was eight months old. I cut the most wonderful tooth. (lively marching music) Wait for the young lady, will you? Yes, sir. There you are. Thank you very much, sir. Thank you. Louisville? - There's the purser. - He'll take care of you. Skeets! Louisville passengers. - Good evening. - Good evening. Be $12. Room 101. No, not two. Only one, for myself. Oh, my mistake. That'll be seven and a half for one. Here you are. (steam whistle blares) You'd better hurry. Oh, we have plenty of time. What are you going to do tonight after I go away? Oh, I'll probably stand on the wharf and watch the boat go. Listen to the music as it comes across the water. Then I'll go back to the store and do all that work I should've been doing for the last three hours. Oh, you did something much better with those hours. You gave them to a stranger. You're not a stranger, Walter Saxel. You're a very old friend. Oh, is that a silly thing to say? No, I think it's very nice. We are old friends. Yes. I feel I've never known anyone as well as I know you. All ready to cast off, sir. Goodbye. Goodbye. You'll have to hurry. Oh, you sound as if you really want me to go. Well, there isn't another boat until tomorrow night. Do you have to go back to work? No. I mean, I ought to, but whether I go back to work or not, you'd better take this boat. I mean, I don't want you to miss it on my account. There goes the gangplank! You'll never be able to get on board now. Oh, you really can't get on board now. I know it. You'll have to stay over till tomorrow. And I've never been so happy about anything in my life. (lively marching music) Well, I see you stayed over another day. Yes, but I'm afraid I'll be leaving tomorrow. That's what you've been saying every day. My guess is you'll probably stay in town long enough to run for mayor. (both laugh) - Hello, Ray. - Hello. Looks like you're going on a picnic. - I certainly am. - Alone? No, Mrs. Wilkes. Whoever heard of going on a picnic alone? [Mrs. Wilkes] Well, have a good time. Thank you, I will. Mother, can I go with Ray? We might declare it holiday and close up the store and all go. Wouldn't that be a surprise to the street if we just locked the door and hung up a sign? "Closed today, everybody gone on a picnic." That's we ought to do. Everybody would talk about it. Of course, Fredda, it's none of my business. Now, now, Mrs. Smith. I know all the things you're going to say and they won't make any difference. I promise you I'll work every night next week. Fredda, have I said one word? I have no control over what Ray does. If she wants to leave the store in the middle of the morning and let us stay here in the heat, there's nothing that I can say to stop it. Why, that's wonderful, Mrs. Smith! You don't know how happy you're making me. (hammer pounding) Curt! What in the world is all this? - I sold out the shop. - John Casey bought it. Whatever made you do that? Well, I finally got convinced I wasn't doing very good with gas buggies. Or anything else. - But where will you go? - Detroit. - Detroit, Michigan? - Mm-hmm. There's a fellow up there that's built eight of these gas buggies and they all run, so I figured I'd better go up there and work with him and find out how he does it. Why didn't you tell me? Oh, I was going to, but... Well, you've seemed kind of busy lately. I can't believe it. The street just won't seem the same. Well, in a couple of years I'll come back and drop over to your shop, and if you'll still here, you can take me out and show me all the changes. And then you'll come right over here and tell Casey he doesn't know how to run a bicycle shop. Oh, no. No, I'm through with bicycles and bicycle shops for the rest of my life. Well, I'll see you before you leave. Mm-hmm. You know, you're a different person already. These last few days you've changed quite a lot yourself. I have? Why, Curt. Ray. You don't think just because I live under a gas buggy I don't know what's going on? Wish me luck? All the luck in the world. To both of us. (dreamy music) There's a cloud up there that looks like an elephant. Which one? That one. You see it? No. Oh, that one looks like... What does it look like? The one with the feathers. I don't know. I used to dream I was falling from way up high. Just before I hit the earth, I'd wake up. Have you ever been up in a balloon? Oh, no, but I'd love to go. It's very cold up there. Is it? It looks warm. (wistful music) Where would you like to live if you could live anyplace in the whole world? I like to live wherever I am. Places are not very different, you know. I know, but if you could live anyplace in the whole world you wanted to, where would you go? I don't know. What place do you like? My place is on a mountain. A very high mountain. It hasn't any name. - Just a mountain. - Uh-huh. It hasn't any houses. Except our house. And we live there all alone. And once a year we come down from the mountain and go to New York. Would you like to go to New York? Well, maybe I wouldn't like New York myself, but we'd go to some city. Say, New Orleans. Walter? - Yes? - What's wrong? Wrong? Yes, you... You suddenly look so practical. Oh, well. Sometimes we have to be practical, even when we look at the sky. I'm leaving tomorrow. There's a boat at noon. I've been trying to tell you about it all day. Every day you didn't leave, I said, "One day he will." You see, they telegraphed today. Oh, Walter, don't look so sad. I know you can't put off your business forever, and I know it can't keep you forever. It will, Ray. [Ray] Keep you forever? Yes. You mean you're... Never coming back here? That's what you do mean. It isn't just a business deal, is it, Walter? It's... My fiance. She lives in Louisville. Our engagement is already announced. Well, is she... Nevermind. I... I wish I could think of something to say, but I can't. I'm not going to cry. I'm not even going to laugh. I'm not going to do anything. And I'm not going to let you say another word. Let's not say anything, now or ever. There's that cloud. It's changed into a swan. By the time it changes into something else, you'll be gone. If I don't see you go, I won't mind anything else. Believe that, Walter. I won't mind at all if I don't see you go. It's changing now. (footsteps rustling through hay) No, it's too soon to tell yet. (footsteps fade away) This time it's going to be a ship. (bittersweet music swells) (lively marching music) - May I use your telephone? - Help yourself. Here you are, Steve. Hello. 1195, please. - What was his number? - One of them's missing until- - How long before the boat leaves? About 40 minutes. Hello? Yes? Who is it, please? Walter. Ray, I had to call you. There's something I want to tell you, but you've got to believe me. Just a minute. Is there another telephone around here? Hey, wait a minute. We're talking to this fella. This is Sunday. You wouldn't find another phone between here and Kalamazoo. Hello, Ray. Ray, listen to me. Listen carefully. [Rude Passenger] Go ahead, we're all listening. Hello. Ray. Ray, I want you to come down here right away, please. Oh, Walter. I... I shouldn't. I said I shouldn't. No, I can't hear you either. (wistful music) All right. I'll hurry. Yes, right away. Well! You finally ready to ship out of here with us? - Yes. - Seven and a half. No, two, please. - Two? - That's right. [Cashier] $12. And you might tell me where the nearest place is where a man could get married if he wanted to? Get married on board. We picked up a minister at Natchez, and he'll tie the knot just as tight as anybody in the wide world. Oh, thank you very much. (bright music) Right on the dot. When I say noon, I mean noon. Never keep a lady waiting. She might not wait long enough. Harry, oh, I'm so sorry. I have- - Where shall it be? Down the main highway, or the country lane, where the little birdies sing and the chipmunks play? I can't go with you. What do you mean? I can't go by myself. Even the horse would laugh. I'm so sorry. I've made another engagement. Uh-uh. First come, first serve. Harry, I'm sorry. I have someone waiting for me at the boat landing. Oh, you have? Well, just to show you Harry Miles is a good sport, if you want to meet him at the boat landing, I'll take you to the boat landing. All right, but I'm in an awful hurry. You'll get there a whole lot faster with this high-stepper than you will in a hack. I'll get out just aside of the wharf. - Anything you say. - Giddy-up, boy. (Clucks) There she goes, gadding off again. The ceremony will take place in the captain's stateroom. - Very well. - Excuse me. Hello. 1195, please. Your luggage is all on board, sir. Thank you. - (phone ringing) - Oh, all right, all right. Hello? Mrs. Smith's... Who? Who do you want? Ms. Ray Smith? Well, she's not in. Oh, you know that? I can't understand you. I said how long since she left there? Oh, she left here at twelve o'clock. What? Oh, she went out with one of her drummer friends. - But you must be mistaken. - She was to meet me here. Well, I saw them go off together with my own eyes, mister. This is not the way to the boat landing. It's the way we're going, sister. Harry, you stop this horse right this minute! (Harry laughs) (melancholic music) - We're miles away! - I must've made a mistake. You have to take me back. No, I haven't. I'm not Ed Porter or one of those soft sap suckers. You made a date with me, and now you're keeping it. - Harry, I told you there's- - Everybody told me. You're one little girl that wraps men around your little finger. You can do that to every other drummer that makes this burgh but you can't do it to me. Harry, listen, I have simply got to get back. Well, go ahead. I'm not stopping you. And I'm not taking you. If you wanna get to the boat landing, get out and walk. (lively marching music) (bright music) I want to check this balance sheet. Yes, Mr. Darren. It'll be a good deal if we can handle the issue. A very good deal. And why shouldn't we handle it? There's Dawson and Company, sir. Old Man Dawson may not want us to. Yeah, well, he'd better change his mind about that unless he's ready to retire. What backs up this preferred? I don't know, sir. Well, catch Mr. Saxel before he leaves. He'll know. Yes, sir. Oh, Mr. Saxel. Mr. Darren would like to see you, please. Very well. Yes, Uncle Felix? Oh, Walter, this guaranteed 7% on the preferred? Oh, I checked that. It's a sound guarantee on their earning reports. Yes. Well, I just wanted to be sure. Are you going to dine at home tonight? I suppose so. I would ask you to come along and have dinner, but Corinne is busy with some committee and she won't be in until later. Corinne is pretty busy these days, isn't she? Well, you know, she loves being on committees. Well, I think I'll have dinner at the club. Would you tell your son I'll be over to take him to the zoo on Sunday? Oh, he'll like that. I'll look over those papers again, Walter. - It's a beautiful job. - Thank you, Uncle Felix. And you might tell Corrine, if she alights long enough in one place to listen, that I said that her husband was a pretty fine banker. - Goodnight. - Goodnight. I beg your pardon. But of course it is! Ray Smith. Walter Saxel. How are you? Well, I am a little disappointed because you walked past me. Oh, I didn't see you. What are you doing in New York? - Doing? I live here. - No. Yes. I have for almost five years. Ah, it's good to see you. You haven't changed. Well, you have a little. It's good. Well, I design clothes for the biggest ready-to-wear house in the city. - You do? - Mm-hmm. And you are an important New York banker. (laughs) Well, I'm in the banking business. Just around the corner, Darren and Holmes. And I am the very conceited father of a son. You are? Congratulations. I can't get over this. I knew. I must've passed this corner dozens of times. - Well, that's funny. - I go by here every day. I've often wondered if I'd ever run into you. Well, now that you have, let's have dinner together. Aren't you expected at home? Oh, no. I very often stay downtown. - But Walter, I- - What? Oh, maybe you are married and expected home yourself. No, but I have an appointment. Well, is it with somebody very special? - Just a friend from- - Oh, break it then. Come on, please. Once every five years is not too often to have dinner with an old friend, is it? (wistful music) Tell me, why didn't you come to the boat landing that Sunday? Oh. I didn't mean to ask you that. I'm sorry. I've been thinking about it all evening. Of course I was very disappointed. I think I was jealous too, after I spoke to your stepmother. But the minister... (chuckles) Oh, he was furious. Mind you, it was to be his first wedding aboard ship. Wedding? Yes. Yes, I had everything arranged. Ah, it was to be a big surprise for you. But it really was a big surprise for me when I found that you had gone out with somebody else. What's the matter? Shall we go? And so I stood there on the dock and watched the boat until it disappeared. If I'd only known, everything would've been different. Let's not talk about it. It's just something that might've happened and didn't. (bright music) [Driver] Thank you, sir. Walter. We can't see each other again. But I have to see you. It's too late. It's been five years. We're not the same people. You have your life, I have mine. If only we hadn't met today. But we did. (car puttering past) I'm frightened. You mustn't be. Aren't you? Yes. (wistful music) We were meant to be together, Ray. That's why we met again. Baseball extra! Opening day... Here you go, sir. Thank you. Extra! Opening day won by the Giants! Hadley out-pitches Roughner! Giants win opening day! Baseball extra dish! (bright music) [Landlady] I can ask for your room whenever I please. I want it now. [Ray] But you could've told me this morning instead of putting me out like this. [Landlady] Your month is up. I need the room. But you can't do this, Mrs. Miller, really. I'm entitled to some notice. You're entitled to no notice. I've been watching you two for some time now. I'm sick and tired of it! Good evening, Mrs. Miller. Packed already, Ray? Yes, I came home to find everything packed for me. Oh, Mrs. Miller's kind hand at work again. You are very thoughtful, and so charming. I don't know what you're talking about. So modest too. Ms. Smith hates to go, but everything changes. No, no. Not this place. I shall always remember the wallpaper and the draft. Now, don't get sentimental or you won't be able to go. - Oh yes, she will. - Oh, she's very brave. You both will have to be brave at the time of parting. Goodbye, charming lady. I'll have a cab come for my things. Please be sure they're all here. Nothing you have that I want. So generous too. Come, Ray. You have to leave this old, old friend. You trying to pull my leg, sir? Oh, Mrs. Miller. For you. Why didn't you tell me about this before? I didn't know about it myself until I came home tonight. I shouldn't have come here so often. That isn't true. I wanted to see you as much as you wanted to see me. Don't worry, darling. There must be lots places in New York where I can live. Should be just about here. Yes. It really sounds very nice. It has a skylight and a view. Yes, here it is. But you can't live here. It's so far away from everything. That's good. All the people in the world like Mrs. Miller, the less we see of them, the better. If I do say so, although I shouldn't, that's the finest view of the river in the neighborhood. All you have to do is stand on your tiptoes to see it. Don't you think it's nice? Very nice. And it's so cozy in the winter and cool in the summer. And that kitchen. Oh, it's a perfect jar, madam. I'll take it. I'll make out your receipt right away. I knew you'd like it the minute I saw you. What is the name? Smith. Ray Smith. - That's one month in advance. - That's right. - Here you are, Mr. - And Mrs. Raymond Smith. Now, if there's anything I can do to help you get settled, why, just ring my bell. - Goodnight. - Goodnight. (pensive music) One more Smith in the world won't hurt. Are you comfortable, Mr. Smith? Newspaper, Mr. Smith? Thank you. I'm sorry I can't put out your slippers. But you haven't any slippers. It would be very nice to be Mr. Smith. I knew they would do that. Do what? United Banking. They've cut their dividend rate. Who cares? We don't, that's right, but at my house everybody would care. - Even you? - Oh, yes. I would be very excited. Where's my tobacco? - Beside your chair. - Oh. Thanks. Yes, I would be already working on a statement for the price. Of course, Uncle Felix would make it, but I would have to write it. [Ray] What would you say? Well, that'd take some thought, you know? I would say, "The dividend cut is justified. United Banking's amortization plan is for future..." Well, "Against future decreases in revenue." Why couldn't you just say it's a wise company that saves up something for a rainy day? What was that you said? A wise company- - That saves up something for a rainy day. - Well, that's wonderful! - Uncle Felix will love that. That's an inspiration. (Ray chuckles) What are you laughing at? I was just wondering what Uncle Felix would say if he knew it had been my inspiration. (laughs) Oh, he probably would fire me from the bank, and Corinne would get a divorce. We never talked about that, have we? No, we never have. Do you want me to divorce Corinne? Well, it would mean that you would have to divorce a lot of other things besides Corinne. Your son. Your career. Your whole way of life. You wouldn't like that, would you? Sooner or later, you'd feel that you'd lost all those things because of me. Why do you say that? I know how much you need them. Anyway, I'm glad you asked me. Now, what is it you're going to tell Uncle Felix? Oh. "It's a wise..." - What was that? - A wise company. "That saves up something for a rainy day." Excellent. (Ed whistling an Irish jig) Oh, what name are you looking for? Smith. Ray Smith. Well, that's four flights up. Four flights? Go on. You can afford to lose a little weight. (Chuckles) Speak for yourself, madam. (both laugh) (knock at door) Who is it? [Ed] Ray? - Who is it? - Ed Porter! No! Ed Porter! - Hello! - Hello! Come in! Oh, what a time I had finding this place. Am I glad to see you! Oh, I haven't seen you for years! Yes, go ahead and sit down while I get dressed. I won't be a minute. Oh, go ahead, take your time. I got all day. Say, this is a nice place you got here. - You like it? - Oh, it's fine. - Live here long? - Oh, almost a year. - Long as that? - Uh-huh. Tell me, what have you been doing? Still Mackleson and Fogerty's star salesman. Only I don't like to travel as much as I used to. Bought a little house outside of Chicago. Right on the lake. Swell place. [Ray] How's the family? Oh, Ray. You oughta see those kids. Molly's a regular grown-up lady. The things that kid can think up to do. - And your wife? - Elegant, elegant. It's nice being a family man. You know, settle down. Well, it certainly seems to agree with you all right. Do I look better? You always look great to me, Ray. Say, what's this? Are you interested in banking? Oh, that belongs to a friend of mine. You're going steady with some fella, aren't you? No, not exactly. Yes, you are, Ray. You can't fool me. (knock at door) - Yes? Who is it? - Me! Oh! All right, Mrs. Dilling. Here's your laundry, Mrs. Smith. [Ray] Thank you. I see you found the place all right. Yes, I did. "Mrs." Smith? Ray? This fella you're going around with, is he married? Yes, he is. Is he in love with you? I think so. Why doesn't he do something about it? Because I don't want him to. I mean, there isn't anything he can do. He sounds very selfish to me. No, he's not selfish. It isn't his fault and it isn't my fault. Ray, this isn't a way to live. Suppose they hear about it where you work? I quit my job. Why did you do that? Well, it... I had to. You know things have been slack. I know. He made you do it. He wants you here waiting for him, all the time. All right, he does! Well, it seems to me you're getting all the worst of this. It seems to me if I am, it has nothing to do with you or anybody else! All right, all right, I'm butting in, but you're missing a lot of things. Things you oughta have! Things you're going to want. You won't always be young. You can't have any friends, because when you make friends, they ask questions, and when they ask you anything, you've gotta say goodbye. Ed, can't we talk about something else? No, Ray. No. This is the only sale I ever really wanted to make in my life. Figure it out for yourself. Look at the arithmetic. Today it's all right, you think you're doing fine. Tomorrow may not be so bad. But how's it gonna be later on? You're just gonna sit around, waiting for him. You were never the kind of a girl who sat around and waited for anybody in the old days. No, Ray, this is all wrong. What you should have is a house in the country and a little family and a guy that belongs to you, who's with you all the time as, long as you live! Ed, will you stop talking about things that concern me and don't concern you? All right, Ray, all right, but I just don't wanna see you make a fool out of yourself. I'd like to see you... No sale. I'm sorry. I didn't mean to make you feel badly. It's all right. Are you selling any of these designs? Yeah, most of them. Here's an idea. I have a friend in Chicago. He has a ready-to-wear factory and he's really going places with it. You'll be a sensation out there. They never saw styles like these. He'll advertise you, he'll- Ed. I don't want to go to Chicago. All right, Ray. If you change your mind, drop me a line at Mackleson and Fogerty's. Goodbye. Goodbye, Ed. Thank you, Arthur. And a happy New Year. Thank you, Mr. Darren. - Happy New Year, Arthur. - The same to you, sir. Well, it's too bad you're not in Florida tonight with Corrine and Richard. Yes, I thought I might make it, but there's been so much to do with that report. Hmm. Well, this is the end of a good year, and I hope the beginning of a better one. What are you doing tonight? Oh, nothing special. Probably stay home. I just thought I'd tell you, if there's anything you wanted, you'd better ask for it now because I'm going to ring the old year out tonight and the new year in. (Chuckles) Oh, I think I have everything, thank you. I brought you a few of these. We had some extra ones. (whistle tweets) (Mrs. Dilling laughs) I just wanted to show you how it worked. That's very sweet of you. Thank you. - Oh, your table looks lovely. - I hope he gets home soon. It's too bad he had to work so late tonight. Yes, it is. Well, goodbye, and happy New Year. Goodbye, and a happy New Year to you, Mrs. Dilling. Happy New Year, Walter! Happy New Year. You didn't really think we were going to let you sit by yourself in the club tonight, did you? - Happy New Year, Walter! - Happy New Year! [Felix] We're the rescue party, and this is no night to be alone. It certainly is not. We're really going to paint the town tonight. You bet we are, Walter! Well, that's very nice of you, but I don't want to break in on your party. Oh, what are you talking about, Walter? Corinne never would forgive me if she thought I neglected you on New Year's Eve. It wouldn't be a party without you, Walter. Certainly wouldn't, and you can be my escort. And mine too. Where were you off to? You don't look like a man who planned to spend a quiet New Year's to me. (crowd cheering) (horns blaring) Operator, will you ring this phone please? I'm afraid it's out of order. (phone rings) No, it's all right. Thank you. (crowd cheering) (horns blaring) ♪ Should auld acquaintance be forgot ♪ ♪ And never brought to mind ♪ ♪ Should auld acquaintance be forgot ♪ ♪ And days of auld lang syne. ♪ ♪ For auld lang syne, my dear ♪ ♪ For auld lang syne ♪ (clock bell strikes midnight) ♪ For old lang syne ♪ ♪ We both have run around the braes ♪ ♪ For old lang syne ♪ ♪ We'll take a cup of kindness yet ♪ ♪ For days of auld lang syne ♪ (crowd cheers) (bright music) Well, I think I'd better go now. Oh, certainly not, my boy. Sit down, please. I've got a little present for you. You've been working pretty hard, Walter. No harder than you. I don't mind you doing it. In fact, I think it's good for you. But hard work is no fun unless you get a reward. Oh, I'm not complaining. Well, you're in line for bigger things, Walter. How would you like to check up on our foreign offices and take charge of our European business? Oh! This is one trip I'd really like. Well, you've got that job. How soon could you leave for Europe? Right away. Next week. Well, you'd better telegraph Corinne to come back right away, because she's going with you. Well, don't you think on a business trip like this I'd better go alone? - I mean, for the first time? - No. You'll be gone six months, maybe more. She could join me later, perhaps. No! Either Corinne goes with you or I send someone else. Oh. Well, it sounds like an order. Well, let's call it a condition. A condition of the job. Walter, Corinne has been going too many places alone. And so have you. Now, people notice those things. Not at first, but later on. If there's something you're trying to say, I wish you'd say it. Well, I don't have to say everything, Walter. But you and Corrine take this trip, and have a good time. (clock bell strikes three) [Walter] Ray. Ray? Oh, Walter. I thought you'd never come. So did I. I tried to telephone. I tried to get away. I tried everything. Oh! And look at that. - Oh, I'm so sorry. - I doesn't matter. I was so afraid something awful had happened to you. No, no! On the contrary. Something very wonderful. Something we must drink to. What? - Tell me, what? - Just one minute. Now. Now you make drink a toast to the new partner in Darren and Holmes. Walter, no! Yes. That's why I'm so late. I couldn't get away from them. You would have been very proud of me tonight. I am very proud of you. Here's all the luck in the world. I'm in charge of all foreign business, and I'm going to Europe to see my branch managers. Europe? When? Oh, in about a week. A week? Yes, I probably will sail on Friday. That is, one minute after midnight, so it'll be Saturday. Friday's bad luck anyway. Yes, it is. (laughs) Oh, now. It's only five or six weeks, you know? (wistful music) I can't go with you, can I? Oh, you don't want to go. It's a business trip. No, not on the same boat. Just so I- It's not going to be long. I want to be wherever you are. I don't care how long I have to wait to see you, if I know there's just a chance you'll telephone and I might see you for a moment. I can't take you, Ray. Corinne is going with me. (melancholic music) Well? Don't you think I'm disappointed too? You said once that all you wanted out of life was money and power. Well, you're getting it. I didn't ask for this job, you know. They're sending me. [Ray] Don't let them send you! What do you want me to do? Throw my chance out the window just because I have to leave New York for a few weeks? A few weeks? You'll be gone for months! You won't have to be alone. You'll have your friends, your business, another life. But this is my job! Of all the people on earth, I thought you would understand that. No, I don't want to understand it. I just don't want you to go. You know very well I'd rather be here with you than any place in the world. I guess that's all I wanted to hear you say. All I need is to have you close to me. I need you too. You believe that? If I didn't believe it, I'd die. (wistful music) Happy New Year, darling. Happy New Year. (bright music) (pensive music) (whistle tweets) (bright music) - Good morning, Mrs. Dilling. - Good morning. Hot enough for you? Oh my, this is a scorching hot day. But I always say you don't feel nearly so hot if you don't think about it. Good morning. - Good morning. - Good morning. Here's one for you, ma'am. Thank you. She's just dying of lonesomeness. I'm glad you brought her a letter this morning. That was the gas bill. [Mrs. Dilling] Well, I certainly envy you people getting away from all this heat. How long are you going to stay? - About two months. - It'll be cooler by then. [Husband] Well, if it ain't we'll stay longer. [Mrs. Dilling] Well, have a swell time. [Wife] We certainly will. Goodbye! - Bye. - Bye! [Mrs. Dilling] Bye, Mary. (pensive music) Hello, operator. Beekman 7565, please. Hello. Is this Darren and Holmes? I wonder if you could tell me when you expect Mr. Walter Saxel back from Europe. Oh. This is... No, nevermind. It doesn't matter. - Hello, Mrs. Dilling! - Hello! Well, things haven't changed a bit. But you certainly have, all sunburned and healthy. And look at little Mary, as brown as a berry. Oh, we had the most wonderful time. I'll tell you all about it later. - Morning, Mrs. Dilling. - Good morning. That's all. Oh, good morning, ma'am. May have something for you on my afternoon trip. You don't need to keep coming down here all the time. If there's anything for you, I'll bring it up. Oh, I was going out anyway. If my phone rings, would you answer it? - I certainly will. - Thank you. And if anybody wants me, tell them I'll be right back. I'm just going to walk over to the grocer's. Oh no, you're not. You're going to ride. I don't believe it. Neither do I. I've done nothing but look for you since I got in town. Why, Curt. I'm so glad to see you. Are you still living in Detroit? Come here, I want to show you something. Ever hear of the Stanward Special? Why, yes, certainly I have. It's advertised... Curt! I'm the "Stan" part. "Ward" is Mike Wardley, my partner. No! Get in and I'll take you where you're going. So, you've become a big automobile manufacturer. Big enough to be entered in the Vanderbilt Cup Race this year. That's why I'm in New York. Remember that parade we put on? Will we have to be pushed home this time too? Well, I hope not. But these cars do funny things. This one isn't much like the first one you made, is it? Oh, it's the same car, it just grew up. We all improve with age. (serene waltzing music) Curt, I haven't danced in years. Well, it's time you started again. You used to do a lot of it when we were back home. - Oh, hello, Curt! - Oh, hello! Where have you been hiding, boy? Oh, just seeing the sights. You know a lot more people in New York than I do. Well, the whole automobile crowd is east for the race. Oh, here's someone you have to meet. Hello Dan. Oh, hello, Curt. How are you? Fine. I want you to meet Ray Smith. - This is Mr. and Mrs. Williams. - How do you do? We hear you're showing Curt the town. Oh, really he's been showing me the town. Dan here is the chairman of our board of directors. Won't you join us after this dance? - Oh, well- - Oh, we'd love to. I never knew you were so shy about meeting people. You're blushing like a schoolgirl. (crowd cheering) (motors roar) (motor roaring) (crowd cheers) Curt, you won! Congratulations, Curt! - That's wonderful, Curt! - Congratulations! Curt, old boy, this means we're going to be the busiest factory in Detroit. Sure does! I'm going back tonight to get things started. This is no time to talk business. Ms. Smith, you ought to be mighty proud of him. I am. Congratulations! That's just for being my mascot. I don't know how to tell you what a lot of fun I've had. Oh, I've had the most wonderful time I've had in years. Notice anything different about me? Certainly I do. Now you're fishing. Oh, no. No, I mean... Remember how I used to ask you to marry me every time we met? I didn't do it this time. I knew there was something I'd missed. Well, I'm going to change my tactics. - Really? - Mm-hmm. This time I'm going to do it in a letter. I'm going to put down all the reasons why two people who get along like we do should be married. And I thought you changed. Now, I don't want any answer now. I want you to answer the letter. See if you can think of some reason. Oh, Curt- - No, no, no. You wait till you get the letter. Goodnight, and thanks. Goodbye, Curt. Goodbye. (wistful music) Hello. Oh! Oh! Oh, my darling. I've waited and waited for this, and the day you arrive I have to be out. Let me look at you. No, noplace did I see anyone like you. Oh, I thought you were never coming home. This Mrs. Whatshername told me you went to the automobile race. Yes, and I'd always planned to run down the stairs to meet you. Oh, I'm so glad you didn't just sit around and wait. I worried about that all summer. Come and tell me about your trip. Oh, well, I saw so many things and met so many people, I wouldn't know where to start. We went everywhere. Were you a big success? Yes. The bank is quite happy. Ah, it's good to be home and see you here. I missed you. Oh, if I'd only known you were coming today, I'd have been out on the roof watching every boat that came up the river. Oh, you've been gone such a long time. Much longer than I thought I would be. But then, when we were just about to sail, everything on the Mauritania was taken, so we had to wait another three weeks because we wanted to come back on that boat. But I waited here the whole day the Mauritania got in. Why, that must have been five days ago. Monday, that's right. Why haven't you come to see me? Oh, you don't know. I've been busy every minute since we landed. But Walter, you could've phoned. No, really, all those reports to make out and meetings to attend. And on top of that, the christening. You know, a new baby is a big event in the Saxel family. A little girl. She was born in Spain. (laughs) When we got off the boat, she cried for hours. What's the matter? Nothing. Well, you hear people talk about wonderful cities, but when you get back to New York, you know it is the most wonderful city in the world. Don't you ag... I'm not very important to you anymore, am I, Walter? Not very important? Ray, what do you mean? You once promised me that you'd never lie or pretend. You don't have to now. Aren't you the one who is pretending now? No. You know you are a part of my life. I never said you were all of it. But I thought I was more than I am. But we both understand what we are to each other. We always have. I'm not so sure. You are the one person in the world I always want to see. You are the only one I know who makes me believe there is something more to living than work and ambition. That's a lot to mean to anybody. But it isn't enough. Maybe it was before you went away, but it isn't now. What's changed you? I don't know. Maybe I've changed because you have. But I haven't. You belong in my life. You have since that first day. You'll always belong in it. I'll always be outside your life. Oh, Walter, it's not the same. The things we shared are gone. No, they are not! But we can't share everything. Oh. Wait. This is... Look, the next time we see each other, let's not spoil it by asking SO many questions, hmm? Besides, you're tired tonight, aren't you? I'd better go. You'll think differently about this tomorrow. Goodnight, darling. Goodnight, darling. (knock at door) Come in. Did you call for a telegraph boy? [Ray] Yes. Here it is. Better read this to you, be sure I'll have it right. "Curtis Stanton, Stanward Motor Works, Detroit, Michigan. If you are still thinking about writing me that letter, send it to Cincinnati. I am going home tomorrow. Signed, Kay." Ray. R-A-Y. Now, Mrs. Smith, this is real Irish linen. Irish! (thick Irish brogue) The auld sod is in every thread of it. When you hold it in your hand, you can see the Killeens out gathering the flax and the old women seated in front of the peat fire at their spinning wheels. Fredda, do we need any Irish linen? We ain't got rid of what he sold us last time. Oh, I'm not trying to make a sale, Mrs. Smith. Just forget about gathering the flax. Forget all about the old women at the spinning wheels. Forget about everything except the price, and you'll see I'm trying to make you a gift because I feel just like one of the family. You remind my of my Aunt Jenny a great deal. Oh, you'd love Aunt Jenny. She's- - Nevermind your Aunt Jenny. How much is it? You're not buying it, you're stealing it, Mrs. Smith. Only 20 cents a yard! Make it 16 and it's still highway robbery. Why, Ray Smith. [Ray] Hello, Ed. You're a sight for sore eyes. Why didn't you tell me she was here? You didn't ask me. Well, this is Ta-ra-ra Boom-de-ay. Here I am in Cincinnata and little Ray Smith's in town. I'm leaving tonight. Fredda, if anyone should ask me, I think it would be a whole lot more fitting for her to be married in her own home instead of going off to Detroit. Hey, are you going to be married? Yes, I am. Who's the lucky fellow? Curt Stanton. Well, that's good news. You oughta be very happy, Mrs. Smith. If anyone's interested in my opinion, I think she should've married him a long time ago. It's a surprise to me he waited this long. Well, he won't have to wait much longer. I'm leaving as soon as I pack. Wait, I'll help you. Well, it's a small world after all. Just think of the many times you came over, helped me pack my trunks, and took me to the train. Yeah. I've got a hunch you're going to be very happy. I am very happy. Well, there's no doubt about it. You're gonna make this Stanton fella the best little wife in the world. Ray, I feel as if I were taking my own daughter off to be married. Oh, Ed. I mean it! Of course, Molly's only six, but someday I'm gonna have to walk up the aisle with her on my arm. And I won't feel any prouder than I do this minute. I won't feel any worse either. Aw. You feel better now? Yes. What about that fellow in New York? What about him? I don't know who he is. I don't wanna know. But did you put the kibosh on him? Yes. [Ed] Tell him about the wedding bells? No, I didn't tell him anything. Where did I put those handkerchiefs? - Here they are. - Oh. Thank you. I wish I could go to the wedding. I wish you could too. Whoa! - Thank you. - Check your trunk sir. Yes. Put it on the Detroit Express. Thank you, sir. What time's your train leave? 7:42. - Got your tickets? - Everything, right here. Well, we've got plenty of time. I'll get something for you to eat. Well, look who's here! How are you, Mr. Saxel? Remember me? How's everything in New Orleans? Oh, I forgot! You're in New York now. I've been reading some great things about you. Oh yes, I want you to meet an old friend of mine. Ms. Ray Smith. She's on her way to Detroit. Walter. Hello, Ray. You know each other! Say, I remember. I introduced you. Right in this very depot. Walter, what are you doing here? I came here to see you. I just telephoned the store. Oh. Well, Mr. Saxel, Ms. Smith has to catch a train. It's been a pleasure seeing you again. Come on, Ray. You didn't write me, you know. Where could I write you? Ms. Smith is on her way to Detroit tonight. And trains don't wait, do they, Mr. Saxel? Ed, please. All right, Ray, but somehow I feel responsible. Please! - Goodbye, Ray. - Goodbye. And thank you. We're very old friends, Mr. Saxel, Ray and me. She's on her way to marry a wonderful fellow. I don't want her to miss that train. No, I won't. Goodbye, Ed. Goodbye, Mister... You haven't the faintest idea who he is, have you? No. I never remember names. Ed Porter. Oh, yes. (wistful music) You heard him say that I'm going to be married? Yes. I didn't know. Had I known, I wouldn't have come. I'm sorry. But I want to wish you all the happiness. I'm going to be happy. I've known him for a long time. Even longer than I've known you. Well, I hope he'll give you everything you want out of life. Yes, he will. I'm never going to be lonely again. I'm going to fill his whole life, every corner of it. He'll adore you. You'll make a wonderful home for him. (train bell clanging) Oh, is that the Detroit train? - Yes, ma'am. - Thank you. I've missed you, Ray. I'll miss you more now. Anyways, good to know that you are happy and that you are doing a wise thing. It isn't too late for me to be wise, is it, Walter? Detroit Express! Dayton, Toledo, Detroit! I don't know how to say goodbye, but we have to say it and mean it. This is the last time we're ever going to say anything to each other. The last time we're ever going to think about each other. Might've been easier if I hadn't come. I could never go back to just waiting, could I? Not knowing whether I'd see you one day or the next, or for weeks or for months. Could I, Walter? [Conductor] All aboard! Could I, Walter? I'm not going to let you go, Ray. [Conductor] All aboard! And I tried so hard. (dramatic music) (locomotive chugging) (steam whistle blares) (train bell clanging) (bright music) [Captain] Hello, Mr. Saxel. Oh, how are you, Captain? It's a great honor to have you meet us. It's a great honor to have you sail with us, sir. You know Mrs. Saxel? Oh, how do you do? I'm glad to see you again. I'm glad to see you again, Captain Anderson. You know my daughter, Elizabeth? - How are you, Captain? - Fine, Ms. Saxel. I can promise you a smooth voyage this time, I hope. And my son, Richard. - How do you do, sir? - How do you do? Oh, Mr. Saxel? Could we have a picture, please? - Certainly. - Hold it right there. All right, fellas. One more, please. There you are. Thank you. Mr. Saxel, I'm Blake of the Associated News. Oh, yes. Glad to see you again. You know the other boys? - How are you, Mr. Saxel? - Most of them. - How do you do, Mr. Saxel? - How are you, gentlemen? There's a story out of Washington that says you're going to Europe as head of the American commission. Really? You're going to the south of France first, I understand, to make it look like a vacation, but your real destination is Geneva. Well, if the story comes from Washington, it must be true. [Reporter] Are you going to Paris to see the American ambassador before you go to the conference? That's difficult to answer now. As chairman of the financial commission, would you care to tell us what your policy will be on trade agreements? I believe, gentlemen, that all news on that should come from the State Department. I really can't say anything. I'm sorry. (foghorn bellows) Well, there's one half of Walter Saxel's life and... (laughs) Here comes the other half. Where? Wherever you see Walter Saxel, you see her. I wonder if his poor wife knows. (laughing) Oh, my dear, hardly. Corinne Saxel thinks a woman like that is something you read about in a French novel. There she is again. Oh, so you know about her too? I ought to. I've seen her often enough. And you can't help hearing about her. The second companionway to your right. It's time somebody did something about her. Who's going to do it? I am. (sentimental music) [Walter] Hello, Ms. Smith. [Ray] Hello, Mr. Saxel. [Walter] Have you had your dinner? [Ray] Yes, in my stateroom. [Walter] I'm afraid I won't see much of you this trip. Everybody on board seems to know me. [Ray] I know. [Walter] I'll see you as soon as we arrive. Usual place. [Ray] Yes, Walter. [Walter] Goodnight. [Ray] Goodnight. (serene music) It's good and hot. How late did they keep you at your conference last night? Oh, till way after one o'clock. What did you do? Went gambling. Don't tell me you won again. - Uh-huh. - You're too lucky. - Thank you. - Now drink it slowly. Did you read my speech? Yes. It's very good. In fact, I think it's the best one you've ever written. You do? Well, if you like it, I know it's good. Are you still going to Geneva tonight? Yes, I think I should be there a few days ahead. You know, rehearse my little talk and hobnob with the diplomats. I wish I could take you with me. You know you can't possibly. One little bit of gossip now and your best chance of your life would be gone. Now who is being careful? And ambitious too. Only for you. Same old Ray. You never change. That's a fine thing to say to a gray-haired old lady. You'll be even lovelier when it's white. Oh, Walter. Goodbye, darling. As soon as I get back from Geneva, we'll spend a whole day together. Don't worry about me. I shall be very happy at the casino. Good luck. Goodbye, darling. (gamblers chattering) (speaking French) (speaking French) (knock at door) Come in. I think you know who I am, Mrs. Smith. I've known about you for years. You follow my father and my whole family like a shadow. Everyone seems to know who you are and all about you, except my mother, and I don't want her to know. Please go. I didn't come to argue with you. I came here to warn you. Leave us alone, Mrs. Smith. Don't do any more to us. Just get out of our lives. My sister's going to be married. If there's any talk about you now, you'll ruin that too. I guess I shouldn't ask you to consider her, or myself. We don't mean anything to a woman like you. Please, you must go. Not until I know that you'll leave us alone. Money is all you want. I know that. Well, I'll get it for you. You won't lose anything. Just get out of my father's life. Forever! (door opens) Hello, Richard. What are you doing here? I have a right to be here. I didn't question that, my boy. I merely asked you what you were doing here. You ought to know that without asking me. Sit down, Richard. I want to talk to you. Long before I married your mother, years before you were born, I met Ms. Smith. (lively marching music) And for 25 years, we've loved each other. I suppose you're still too young to know just how long that is, or what it's meant to me. But this is a corner of my life that belongs to me alone. You can't get into it, and you can't force me out. What am I supposed to do? Forget about Mother and start cheering? You're supposed to understand, if you are big enough. And if I'm not big enough? Then you're supposed to mind your own business and get out! I'll get out, but this is my business. You've been selfish enough to sacrifice all of us for her. I think you're both contemptible and rotten. (melancholic music) A cool glass of water? Yes. Why did you come back from Geneva so soon? Thank you. I've been removed as head of the commission. Walter, why? I don't know. But it was all very official, very polite. Did they hear about us? Oh, I don't know. I don't mind losing that job. All I want to do now is rest. Oh, Walter. Your son, and now your best chance. I've cost you both of them. Don't ever leave me, Ray. I won't. You know I won't. We'll have tomorrow all to ourselves. I'll come over in the morning for breakfast. Would you like that? Darling, you look so tired. No, no, I feel fine. Oh, thank you. What did Richard say before I got here? Oh, nothing. Nothing that matters. Oh. Goodnight, darling. Goodnight. (knock at door) Come in. - Bonjour, madam. - Good morning. - Viola, Le Journal. - Ah, thank you. (dramatic music) Walter! (brooding music) I think he wants to talk to you. Do you want to speak to me, Dad? Alone. What is it, Dad? Phone. The phone. Phone? You want me to phone someone? Two, Six, seven, nine. Give me 2679, please. Hello. Is this 26797. (Walter breathing raggedly) (somber music) Ray... Walter? I'm here, Walter. I'm listening. Ray... What is it, Walter? (Walter gurgles) Walter, I'm still here! I'm listening! Dad? Dad! Doctor! Doctor! Walter? Walter! [Doctor] Nurse, stethoscope. (ominous music) I'm sorry. He's gone. Walter, don't leave me! Walter, you can't! Walter, don't go! (dramatic music) But I do not know if it is good for you to enter, monsieur. Madam has let no one go in. It's all right. I have something for her. I bought you a steamship ticket, to take you back to New York. Your stateroom is reserved in the name of Reynolds. That's because the reporters might recognize your name on the passenger list. I didn't think you'd want to talk to them. Oh, I'm sorry. I didn't know you were ill. I'd better get a doctor. (wistful music) Your son was just here. Walter, he was so nice to me. Might've been my son. Our son. I wonder what would've happened if I'd met you that Sunday at the boat. (lively marching music) (wistful music) (bittersweet music swells) (ominous drums rumble) (dramatic orchestral music)
