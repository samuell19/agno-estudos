Oh please lucien. I know I wasn't much good. But it's not your fault. You see alcohol does the old, um... Whatsit I'm usually terrific. Well, better than that. It's not just you. It's me also. I drink too much, I'm careless. Oh you're not crying because of Rick the stick? Oh, no, no, no. My angel, we can't lose any tears over lover-boy. I thought I like him very much, not now. Good well just leave it like that. You've made the royal couch, put it in your diary and forget it. I can never forget tonight. Why, because he's Ricky strange? Top pop? No, because he was my first time. And I am hating him and me and you. Everything tonight. Yes well. I don't blame you, old girl. Come on get into this while uncle buster tells you the facts of half life. You see, in this scene, nothing is serious. Nothing's, nothing's for real. It's all just one night stands. Do you understand? It's uh, eine nacht, oh what the hell's the German for stand? I understand. Yes, you would because you're a smart girl. You're smarter than me because you're getting out of this whole push right? It is not my scene. No, come and get some rest. And don't worry about me. I'll be faithful old rover at the foot of your bed. Danke. For god's sake, don't tell anyone. I spent the night on the sofa. Oh fantastisk. How long you work for the sheik? Since we were 15. Are you his au pairs? - No his handmaiden. - Oh. Each day he tries to make so many people happy. And then each night, we try to make him happy. It's a good job handmaiden, better than au pair. I think I go through your agency. The sheik alone makes his choice. And usually from his own kingdom. He has a kingdom?! 2 million people to whom he is a god. It's not possible? Each year he tries to make them a little happier. He has doubled their standard of living. Once they existed on only ?10 a year. Now they exist on ?20. He sounds a very fine man, the sheik and very rich. He has 14 oil Wells, ten Ruby mines, eight palaces, also 20 cars and six yachts. - No colour TV? - Four in every room. Four? Oh fantastisk I'm lucky to know such a man. And you're now ready to make him happy. Oh ja. Come, my child. We will drink a toast to the lucky stars that brought us together. 'Tack, tack.' May your days be happy and your nights fulfil. Sk?l. It's better than aquavit. - Have you ever had couscous, my child? - What is couscous? Is the unmatchable dish of the east. Oh, it's not possible. Malcolm already feed me spaghetti. Oh, what is that? Is a bed? It is the couch of a myriad delight. Oh, fantastisk, I try? Wunderbar. No more jumping, little one. There are better ways to expend your energy. You-you are very beautiful, my little one. You fill me with great desire. Me too, I have great desire. Name it and I shall try to fulfil it. Please I desire to see colour TV. - Now? - Yes. I haven't seen in england yet. But I fear there is no TV after midnight. Tomorrow you may look. After midnight? It's after midnight now? Yes, but what is time when one is so young? Mr Howard. He very cross and mrs Howard in bed. I'm in very big trouble. My little Swedish delight. Why? Why are you leaving me? Anita my Swedish meatball. Oh my good lord. Come back to me. Come back to me Anita! Come back to me. Come back to me Anita! My little bird where are you going? Why are you leaving me? It's big trouble. You help me, please. Your word is my command. You can explain mr Howard - maybe he listen you please? - Oh I. Oh no. What we do now? Well we go to my office. Your office? You see, my dad's secretary keeps a dress in her locker like I do in mine. You wear a dress? Oh ha bloody ha. And I also have some drink, a couch and the rest of the evening for unfinished business. So out you get and we can make us... Oh Christ! The key, I forgot it was on the bunch I lost. We can't get in after all. So what we do? Well, we'll have to wait till a caretaker opens up in the morning, you know? Still give me time to have a shave and you time to tidy up. We'll just say you missed the plane. But it is not true. We can't tell him we spent the whole night together. In calenberg they will never believe. What? My first night asleep in car park. Who says you're going to sleep, huh? It's all right now. There's nothing to tear. Ricky? Here is christa with you. I do not see you again. No later chico Lola. Oh what time is it? Oh you want me to take you home? Danke, but I do not go home. If it is all right, I fetch my clothes and return this later. Auf wiedersehen. - So that's... - My ex-au pair. Oh! Come here you beautiful creature. Don't let us start that farce again. Farce? Well it's not that we haven't had the odd unfortunate booking before, but this is ridiculous. Oh well I'll just have to try and find you something else. Good morning, I Anita. Not trouble with your family? - Oh, ja I'm out. - No! Yeah, but it's good, I out and I in and they also little out. Slowly girl, more slowly. No, no slowly, come quickly. Come with me. Those girls must be put through my agency. And I need references.
