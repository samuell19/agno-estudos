In a place in La Mancha whose name I don't want to remember some time ago lived a nobleman with spear, old leather shield, thin old horse and running greyhound. Our nobleman was about 50 years old. He had a robust constitution, thin, with a lean face, was an early riser and friend of hunting. Some people say that he had the nickname of Quijada o Quesada but there are some differences in the authors that write about this. But this is not important for our story. The important thing is that everything is true. And this aforementioned gentlemen, when was idle, that's to say almost everyday, liked to read chivalresque novels with so much love... that he forgot the exercise of hunting and management of his estate. And was so great his curiosity and foolishness, that sold... a lot of land to buy chivalresque novels. And that way, he took to his house as many as he could. But he preferred the ones written by Feliciano de Silva. Because he liked very much the clarity of his prose and his intricate sentences. Even more when he read those amorous compliments and duels, where was written in many places: The reason of the injustice that is made to my reason, weaken so much my reason that I have a reason to complain... about your beauty. With this ideas, the poor knight lost his mind. And tried to understand them and to decipher their meaning. But even Aristotle would have been unable to understand them, if he would have resuscitate just for that. The high Heaven that with your divinity, divinely with the stars fortify you... and make you deserve what deserves your... nobility. And this way, he thought the most estrange idea... that never was thought in the world. And he decided to become a knight errant and to go all over the world... with his arms and his horse in search of adventures. And to solve any kind of problem and to run a lot... of risks so that solving it he had an eternal name and fame. And the firs thing he made was cleaning some weapons... that belonged to their grandparents. They were covered in rust and patina and put in a corner. Then, he spent four days thinking in a name... for his horse. Because the horse owned by a famous kinght must have... a known name. And, finally, he called it Rocinante. A name that he thought was, high, sonorous and important. After that we wanted to think in a name for himself. And he spent with this thought eight days more. And at the end, he decide to be Don Quixote. Then he realised that he only needed one more thing, looking for a dame who fall in love with. Because a knight errant without a love was a tree without leaves. And body without soul. In a place close to his there was a good looking farmer, and he had been in love with her for some time, but she never knew this, of course. Her name was Aldonza Lorenzo, and he gave her the title of lady of his thoughts with the name of Dulcinea del Toboso. Then Don Quixote talk to a farmer, a good man, if this can be said of... a poor man but very stupid. And he insisted and promised so much, that the poor farmer decided to go with him and to be his squire. I hope, Sancho, that we have some adventures. If this happens, you'll make fortune very quickly. And you'll be a very rich man. - Really? - Believe me, Sancho. I believe you but for me the most important thing is... - What is it, Sancho, my friend. - Look, my lord... Talk without fear, Sancho. My isle, the one you promised me. You must know that the knights errant used to make... their squires governors of the isles they won. And I'll do the same. Or even more. Because they used to wait until their squires were... very old to give them some title. But if you live and I live, it may be that I win very early... a kingdom with others attached to it. And I could make you king of one of them. And don't you think that this is strange, because... to these knights happen so many things... that I could give you easily more than I have promised. There were some knights, like the famous Amadis de Gaula, that gave to their squire the title of count. Jump. Come on, donkey, jump. My donkey is different. Jump, you stupid. Come on, Sancho. But I expect to exceed all them in generosity. Do you see this fertile land? You could own it in a few days. I don't like it too much, sir. I prefer the isle. Since the time of the round table, the order of knighthood extended. And in it were famous, besides the brave Amad?s de Gaula, the valiant Belianis de Grecia... I, the same way that these knight, walk this land... to help all the needy. And those knights, did they also give isles to their squires? You'll have an isle, Sancho. The bad days that are waiting for you... will be generously rewarded with the land you'll have. And if I were a king my Teresa would be a queen, and my children princes. And who doubt it, Sancho? I doubt it, because my Teresa is no good as queen. Countess will be better for her. And that with some help from God. God will give her the best thing for her. But you should be at least governor. I've always been very good at that. Besides, you'll give me all that I need. You're right, Sancho. But, before looking for isles, we have to look for adventures... to gain name and fame. This way, when we arrive to the court of some king, I'll already be a knight known for his actions. You're right. And when we come into the city, everybody will follow me saying: "This is the one who defeat the giant Brocabruno" and the people will lean out of the windows. Damn it! An infernal machine! That monster has kidnapped a princess! But I'll save her, Sancho. Wait, sir, don't be mistaken. It's just a Vespa. Stop, you rogue! Stop! Madam, I'll save you from this evil machine. Set that princess free. Who is this madman? Don Quixote de la Mancha. Knight errant, and servant of Dulcinea. Look, knight-errant, let me pass. - You're under the spell of this thing. - Don't be stupid. Go away. - You're bewitched, madam. - Go away, mummy. Oh, you heartless, I'll skewer you. - Sir... - This guy is nuts. Poor wretch, how can you treat this way your saviour? He's crackers. And promise me you'll go to the Toboso and will talk... the beautiful Dulcinea about my heroic deed. I'll skewer you, damned. This is too much. Go away. You're free. If I'm free you're going to come with me. And you're not coming back until I pass. - How you dare...? - Be careful, sir. Poor maid. You're definitely bewitched. Let me go, Morgana. Let me go, you evil. Take care, madman. Go to hell. Sorrows were made for the beasts, not for the men. When men suffer them too much, they become beasts. You should show that gallant spirit the knights have. You must start moving, stand up and start walking. It's no use being here seated sighing? Firs we go running everywhere. And then you seat here thoughtful in this lost place. Okay, do whatever you want. I swear God that I'll live the life that lived the marquis of Mantua. And who is that? The noble marquis promised not to eat... and not to be with maids... and other things that I don't remember, until I take my revenge on this infernal machine. That marquis would drink a lot of wine. - I've made a promise. - I'm glad. I'll fast until I was worthy of Dulcinea's love. Forget that promises. They aren't healthy. I relinquish food - Not me. And you, Sancho, will relinquish wine. You shouldn't make promises in my name. Silence! Oh, flower of the knight-errantry. Oh, shinning light of the arms. Let's hope to Almighty God, that the people that try to... get in the way of your heroic deeds... never get what they desire. Oh, Don Quixote de la Mancha. Light and mirror of the kight-errantry of la Mancha, and the first that in these calamitous day, took up the exercise of arms and of solving problems. Listen. It's... You're tiring me... What a day. He is starting to pester me. But I'm talking with my donkey, with the plants. Not whit you, for Pete's sake! Ay, Lord. If I knew at least where are we going. Gee up! You could have warned me. All right. I lift your penitence. Wait until the story of the incredible deeds we are about to... stage, sees the light. And what about eating? A spiritual food will be the golden age, where deeds worthy of being cut in bronze will see the light. Wouldn't it be better that you forgot the penitence? Oh, you, wise man who must be the chronicler of this story. And don't forget mentioning Sancho, even though you prefer the big names. Su mustn't forget either our hunger. Oh, beautiful Dulcinea del Toboso, you are lucky of... having a knight at your feet. I'm at my feet to. - A knight thirsty of love. - And Sancho, thirsty of wine. - Begging on his knees... - Something to eat. - Oh, blessed... - Blessed, who? - Blessed you, oh, century. - Blessed are the sausages. Blessed century that see the birth of Don Quixote de la Mancha, matchless Dulcinea's slave. My God, Don Quixote has split his head open. Oh, lady of beauty. Effort of my weaken heart. You, my sweet enemy, must look now... with your noble eyes at this captive knight, who is living this great adventures for your beauty. - I don't understand anything. - Don't you, Sancho? And nevertheless is simple. It means that your master is still fasting. Fantastic. Don't you think that I'm doing this to be famous. Fasting help us to meditate. And once away from the worldly goods... we can at last get the fame in the spirit. Shit. You must choose your words carefully. Are you talking about food again, Sancho? About a big stew, exactly. I wonder where I will find it. - Here. - In the mountains? - Where the spirit flies. - And my tummy. - Sac of evils... - It'll be an empty sac. Where the eagles break the bitter loneliness... for being witnesses of my spite. And of your hunger, I guess. You can make penitence but I'll fill the saddlebags. And let's no talk more. Do whatever you want, beast of little soul. That's it. See you later. And you can chew mud if you're very hungry. - You mean! - You can insult me, I'll go anyway. Leaving Don Quixote full of high thoughts, Sancho went looking something to eat. And he found it. Don't you like this smell? It tastes very good. You must know that many knights didn't eat in a month. Did they? Anyway, nobody can see us. Do you like? Shut up and eat. Yes, I'll do it. Don't you want just a little? - What a pity. Come on, sir. - Don't tempt me, devil. Are you sure you don't want? It's delicious. Come on. A little wing it is nothing. Come on, Don Quixote. Try this wing. Even the knights errant must eat something. Have a go. Stop dissimulating and attack without fear. You're very thin. Nobody can see you. - Delicious, isn't it? - It's very good, but I can't. Is that all? It's perfect for me. I like eating this way. Without any respect. Without chewing slowly, neither cleaning me often... All the things you just can do when you're on your own. Sir, wouldn't you eat a little more? Come on, you glutton, take all it. You're the devil, Sancho. Really delicious. - Liven up, there is more. - Just this. The good Sancho couldn't imagine that the adventures... were going to cut in front of them to spoil... his pacific digestion. What a hot day. - You, stop pestering. - Sancho, the way is long. With bread and wine you can walk the way. But a chicken must be too much and spoil the digestion. If you had fasted like me... Look, donkey, I'm going to hit you. Come on. My weapons, Sancho. Do you see that dust cloud? It's a big army. There are two dust clouds. The following centuries will remember this day. Don Quixote will show no mercy to those who dare to challenge me. Listen, Sancho. Don't you hear the clamour? And that army is driven by the valiant Lauracalco. And that one by the fearful Micocolembo. For Dulcinea's sake! Don't you see they are only lambs? For Dulcinea! For Dulcinea! Come back, sir Don Quixote. - What is that guy doing? - Go away, you bastard! Go back. Go away, son of a bitch. You'll see. Lauracalco has betrayed me. Didn't you realise they were sheep? I remember having read that a knight called Diego P?rez Vargas, having lost his sword in a battle, pulled a oak up and crushed so much Moors with it, that was called 'the crusher'. Raise the... I'm telling you this, because I'll pull up a branch too, from the first oak we find. I've caught your... And my revenge will be so big that you'll see... incredible things. How are you going to revenge if they are always a lot... and we are one and a half? - I am like one hundred men. - That't true. A hundred beaten men. I must show you my bravery. What for? What do you mean, what for? You, insolent. Nobody is going to beat me. I'm pacific and I don't like fights. I'll tie you to a tree and, naked, I'll beat you a thousand times. Don't dream of that. Freedom is on of the most precious gifts... given to men by Heavens. I won't go against your will. At least until you know the rules. I'm dying for knowing them, sir Don Quixote. - Sancho, listen to me. - I'll do it if you are reasonable. According to our code, until you are not a knight, you can't help me. So, even is you see me in difficulties, you must not defend me. I'll obey you. I'll obey this commandment like the days of obligation. I made a mistake fighting against men that weren't of my condition. But now, come here, good Sancho. - Inspect my mouth. - Your mouth? Okay, open it. Wait. How many teeth did you have in this side? - Four. - Four? Are you sure, sir? Four or maybe five. I haven't lost a tooth in my whole life. Open it again. Let's see. Let me count. In the down jaw you have only two teeth. And in the other... there's no one. Look, sir, it's smooth like my palm. Oh, furious soul. Oh, wasted bread. You see how they pull my teeth up and you do nothing. Don't start again. I'd prefer having lost an arm. Not again. You. You must know that Don Quixote will defend the honour of... Dulcinea del Toboso against anyone who wants to stain it. If you are not careful, you're going to kill yourself. I hope they haven't heard you. I challenge anyone who says that there is a maid... more beautiful that the matchless Dulcinea. If the one in the tower hears you, we're in troubles. - That's all. - Great. Now come with me. You're fortunate for coming with me in this return... to the golden age of wisdom and honour. Of the nobility. Fortunate for seeing how it's renewed in me, the knight-errantry. Fortunate because you can contemplate the beauty... of this eminent cities. Like Montiel, cradle of the dukes of Abrantes. Or like Almagro, walled city and of superb past. When the rubicund Apolo put over the earth... the golden thread of his beautiful hair. And, when the little birds greeted the dawn... the famous Don Quixote de la Mancha, abandoning the feathers of his bed, lift onto his famous... horse Rocinante and started walking over the field of Montiel. This way will talk, Sancho, the pages that will told my adventures. And they will be famous, and will talk about moments of serenity like this one too. When the hero contemplates the historic walls of Calatrava. And of Almagro. Sir, I don't think I can gain an isle in this land of mule drivers. Don't worry, because if there are no isle, there is the kingdom of Denmark, that is perfect for enough. But let's look for a castle to stay in. Like this one, for example. I know the owner and I'm sure he will welcome us with open arms. - Castle? - It's a castle and not a bad one. And you can be happy, beautiful Dulcinea, because you have captive such a famous knight. - Have you fall asleep? - Me? Not at all. Tonight has happened something. I feel as if someone had beaten me. As if one thousand devils had taken against me... wrecking me with their snouts. Since I'm with you I can't sleep a wink. Before that, I lied and that was enough to sleep the sleep of the dead. Don't be surprised. I'm sure this castle is bewitched. Yes, of course. It doesn't even seem to be a castle. I'd say it's no more than a barn. And full of fleas. Tonight I've lived a strange adventure. It'd be strange that you hadn't lived it, because with you not even the sleep is normal. Am I so bad with you that you grumble against me? No, but I think you have too much fantasies in this head. - Don't you believe in the spells? - Not really. And in the bad presages? Not, but I don't want to tempt the devil. I don't know what happens in the village, but they started with bells and now with drums. Do you think it will be a wedding or a funeral? Sir, what happens? Don't you see those scoundrels? Hiding their faces under those masks, they drag enchained the vanquished, indifferent to their mothers or wives's grief. Those poor and crying ladies. I feel shame that they are armed men. I must show them all my courage. Those rogues will receive such a lesson, that they'll never forget the name of Don Quixote. Don't you see it's a procession? A procession, you see there poor wounded men, barefoot prisoners and enchained bearers of crosses, while this arrogant people march calmly... turning the grief in a show. I was born to solve this kind of affronts, and I won't let you take a step more, scoundrels. Those rogues will know my Tizona. You rascals! Don't you see they are only some penitents? Stop, whoever you are. Don Quixote orders this. - Stop, furious people! - Nobody can stop him. I know you are responsible of this. Don't go away, scoundrels. Answer for you acts or my sword will go through you. He's crazy. Don't you hear me, you damned? Sir, come back here, come back. Stop him. Catch him. Fight, defend yourselves. Take that, you scoundrels. Ay, they're going to kill him. Stop the entourage. For Dulcinea. For the beautiful Dulcinea. - Damned crazy. - Scoundrels. I'll kill you. Dulcinea. Dulcinea del Toboso. Oh, my Dulcinea. She wounded my love with her whip. Not with her white strap. - And touching her head... - Sir. Here cried Don Quixote the absence of Dulcinea del Toboso. Of the noble lineages that there are in the Toboso, that are a lot, antiques and very good, I'm sure that a big part corresponds to the matchless Dulcinea. Dulcinea? Who do you think that gained for you that isle and made you governor with the title of marquis... What isle? And all the advantages that it mans? She made me, do you say? When did all that happen? Almost happen. I thought so much in it that I thought it has happened. And who do you think is responsible of such mercy? - Who? - Well... Dulcinea del Toboso. Will you deny that she fights and wins in me and I live and breath, and have my life and being in her person? Really, I've never seen that lady. Never? Poor anguished, I'm blessed. Don't you know that it's the strength that she gives to my arm, what makes me able of fighting against such a great people? I've never met her. I've satisfied grievances, solved problems, punished insolences, and defeated giants. I'm in love. Only because the knights errant must be in love. And I'm not vicious but platonic. Over there. Let's go over there, my good Sancho. - Not over there. - Toward the Toboso. I'm sorry, sir. I'm really sorry. When you talk about Dulcinea, who lives in the Toboso, I don't know... I've relatives there and they should know her. Some people call her Aldonza Lorenzo. She's Lorenzo's daughter. Yes, I know her. She could take out any knight from the mud. What do you say? Be careful. Don't get angry. I know too that her mouth smells of onion. Like all women of her condition. You're wrong. Her mouth smells of ambrosia. But the best thing is that she is not choosy at all. Because she laughs at everything. But, aren't we going to stop? It's very hot. Are you going to give me the isle you won with the masked me? With the adventures we have lived so far... you could only win a broken rib or a cut ear. Jeez! That's not too much. But it'll be worse if we run into the guards... and you start beating them. Don't be afraid, my good Sancho. Have you ever seen a man more valiant than me? Besides, where have you read that a knight errant was taken... before the justice for his homicides? I know nothing about 'homecides'. I never tasted that. And have you read of any man who has more skill than I have? I've never read any story, because I can't read nor write. Your ignorance excuse you a little. Then you must trust a knight of so highs condition. So high condition? I'd say a knight of so sad figure. The wise man that have to tell my heroic deeds, will have considerate appropriate that I have a nickname, like the knights from the past. One was named 'The one with the unicorn'. Other, 'the man of... maids'. Other 'the one of the Phoenix'. And they were known with those names all over the earth. And I think that the wise man will have made you think of... that name: 'The knight of the sad figure... And this will be my name from now on. And so that that name can suit me more, I'll make paint in my shield a very sad figure. Oh, my lady Dulcinea. Treasure of supreme grace, repository of all virtue and bearer of all pleasures, where are you? Oh, moon, send me news from her. Maybe you're looking at her in this moment. Are you sleeping, brother Sancho? How do you want me to sleep if you're asking me if I sleep? Why don't you have a rest? Am I one of those knights... that rest in the middle of the danger? - Don't you ever sleep? - You can sleep if you want. The heaven has ordered for the squires that they are... stung by mosquitoes and killed of hunger. Let's sleep a little more. Light my intelligence and y give strength to my heart, so that I can do the impossible and I don't be afraid of lions. Oh, lady of my acts and movements. Clear Dulcinea. Come on, Sancho, hurry up. It's time of making heroic deeds to melt Dulcinea's heart. And where are those deeds? Here, there...? Any place is good for an adventure. But that lady you talk about, she's not a lady or she's not Aldonza. You mustn't listen to those lies of envious people. If she were so important, I'd know it. Envy is the root of a lot of evils and woodworm of virtues. All vices produce some pleasure. But envy only produces quarrels, grudges and anger. Her name is Dulcinea, her country the Toboso. Her quality at least must be princess, because she's my queen. Her beauty is superhuman, her hair gold, her forehead Elysian fields, her eyebrows rainbows, her eyes suns, her cheeks roses, her lips corals, her teeth pearls, her hands ivory, and her skin snow. The fortune has lead our steps like we wanted. I don't know very well what are you talking about, sir. Fortune for me is to have some money, and to live peacefully with my family without any fight. They are, Sancho, thirty or more wild giants... and I'm going to fight against them. What giants are you talking about? They are only mills. Shut up, you ignorant. Maybe I'm an ignorant, but you're crazy. They are windmills. Those things that can seem to be arms, are the sails. They're them. I know them well. Let me tell you that you're head is full of marbles, and that you look at things not with the eyes of your face, but with the eyes of your wild fantasy. But I warn you, I won't help you this time. Briareo. It's him in person. Don't get excited. I'm going to leave you alone. And I don't care if you don't give me the isle. I prefer Sancho without properties, that properties without Sancho. I don't want you to take part in the battle. Contemplate from here my heroism. Don't flee, coward and vile creatures, I'm just one knight. - He's goofing again. - Tremble, you cowards. Even thought you move your menacing arms, you'll pay for it. The knight of the sad figure, on behalf of his loved Dulcinea, will take care of your bones, villains. Out, great riffraff. Surrender to my strong arm. Surrender to Don Quixote de la Mancha. I'll make you try my noble blade. War, war. Defend yourselves or give me your will. I'll die or you'll taste my blade. Die! Evil spirits, that turn the mills into giants. What did I told you, sir? Let me help you. The wise man Frest?n, my worst enemy, is the one who has made this spell. He has turned the mills into pacific mills. But this trick will get you nowhere, you scoundrels. Your guile is nothing against my sword. I believe in all you told me. But stand up straight a little. You're bent... because of the falling. But I don't complain because knight mustn't do it. If you have pains, I'd like you to complain, as I do. We squires don't play this knight's game of... not complaining. When I fell any pain, I shout. I shout because of the pain and to see if someone helps me. I don't ask you to help me or show courage. Audacity and pride are not necessary for a squire. Why don't we have a rest in that village? Don't you see we must go ahead? Come on, donkey. Come on, my good Sancho. You're bravery amazes me. Or at least your power of endurance. Are you amazed of my courage? If I had the balsam of Fierabr?s, you'd see wonders. The balsam of Fierabr?s? What the hell is that balsam? He's impossible. And why do you try to understand him? Just follow him, as we do. I've the recipe of the balsam and with it you don't have to be afraid... of dying of any wound. Then I'll change the isle for the recipe. Mutt, out of here. Out. Out. Let it alone, if it barks that means we're riding. Yes, but, to where? Don't go so fast, my donkey is not a racing horse. Don Quixote, wait. I think that it'll be better for you to be one of these... knights that live peacefully in the court. Not all knights can be courtiers, and all courtiers can't be knights errant. And there are a lot of differences between us. Queen and high lady. Most sweet Dulcinea del Toboso. If you beauty despise me, if you value don't likes me, I couldn't stand this problem, that, besides strong, it's very long lasting. It's for my lady. A letter. You must remember, Sancho, that love is like death. Of course, yes. Because love, like death besiege the castle and the house. - Do you know one thing. - Tell me, Sancho. Looking at you, I can't imagine how anyone... can fall in love with you. Most sweet Dulcinea del Toboso. You're beauty inspires me. Even if you're beauty never is mine, my feelings will never change. The knight of the sad figure is dying for your love. This name is perfect for you. Especially in such a beautiful letter. Stand up and walk. The wise man that must tell this story, that's to say me, it's in an embarrassing situation, because the events he's about to tell are almost incredible, in spite of being absolutely true. This is not surprising, because the real driver... of this story is Don Quixote and he's crazier day after day. That's true. As the saying goes: 'The truth always floats... over the lie like water over oil... - Thanks, Sancho. - You're welcome. As you wish. Take your new spear. - Hurry up, Sancho. - Yes, give me. But, pleas, you should liven up your heart in the meanwhile. Because now it must be smaller than a hazelnut. Remember that... "who defeats himself, defeats 100 giants". Or "thing often happen when you least expect them". Go, my son. And don't let them to deny you the sun of beauty you're going to see. And then, he turned around and we also are going to leave... Don Quixote loaded with sad and worried thoughts. The moment he let Don Quixote out of his sight, the faithful squire started speaking alone. Where are you going, Sancho? I'm looking for a princess. And who send you to look for her? Don Quixote, who solves problems and protects the innocents. And do you know where the house of this lady can be? Don Quixote says that it must be a royal palace or elegant castle. How will I recognise her? We have never seen him. First of all I'd have to know if she exists. Because if she's Aldonza I'd have to look for her in a pigsty. But if she's Dulcinea I should look for her in a palace. Maybe in the palace's pigsties. You're in big troubles. Think, Sancho. Don Pablo, we're thirsty. I'm coming. I'm sick of all this dust. If Don Quixote mistakes the mills for giants and the flocks for armies, it won't be very difficult... to make him believe that his Dulcinea is one of those. Stop talking. Why not? If he doesn't believe me I'll swear and swear. What has happened, Sancho? Could I mark this day with a white stone? I bring you three stones, instead of one. Look at these beauties. Don't pretend to liven up my sadness. With false joy. What are you talking about? That is the princess and her maids. Those are just some farmers, Sancho. What are you saying? You bring me coarse and common villagers. But, sir, your mind is fooling you again. They are very high ladies. Look at them. Queen, princess and duchess. Here you are the great knight Don Quixote, that is stunned by your sight. Go to hell. Don't flee away Don Quixote de la Mancha. ?De la Mancha? You mean the stain. That must be an enchantment. The magician that hate you will have made that you think... she's a villager, but for me she is a princess. ?Nothing? You start early. I'll get such a sword, that any spell will be able of vanquish it. But you should find an adventure for gaining fame. I follow you, but make up your mind. Where are we going now? - Towards south? - Why towards south? Over there, there are only bullfighters and travellers. - Don't argue with me. - I just asked. Aren't we going over there? Go ahead. I can't understand him. You can be sure of that. But, from now to tomorrow there are a lot of hours. And in a moment, your house can fall. I've seen the rain and the sun at a time. What do you mean, Sancho? When you start saying proverbs one can only expect... that the same Judas take you away. My master is completely nuts. And I'm sillier than him, because I follow and serve him. If the sayings "tell me who you go with and I'll tell you who you are" and "not who you born with but who you eat with" are right, then, if he's crazy, I am too. Protect the innocent is my duty as a knight. Because the errant spirit is still alive... the knight-errantry was out of fashion. But the knight-errantry is the only hope for the future. You already know the words that are in our standart. Women and children first. You mustn't doubt that this art is the best, and it's more valuable the more dangerous it is. But I think that any man must take care of himself. Women and children first. Don't get excited. You mustn't try to make me believe that... the white is black and the black is white. For me everyone is as good as God. Even thought he is much worse. I'd like to see the inventor of all this thing... of the knights errant dead. I should have gone home and stayed there. - If you want to go, I won't hold you. - And what about my salary? Add it up and get paid. Get paid. That's easy to say. At first all are promises. You'll have an isle, you'll be governor... But when it comes down to it, you just tell me "get paid". With what? I've made a bad business. In your saddlebags have all my things. Take all that you need. - From the saddlebags? - That's what I've said. - But they are empty. - Tale my bag. You scoundrel. I'll find other squire more diligent and less chatty than you. The squire of a knight errant works more... than a stable boy and lives worse. He eats bread, must sleep in the open and besides over the hard floor. Bread, received with ingratitude, as I can see. You abandon me just now when I was going to make you... governor of the best isle in the world. Sancho, you're a dumb, and you'll be until the day you die. Because that day will be before you find out... you're only a stupid animal. But now it's time for me to make my bigger deed. You're right. I'm a donkey. I only miss the tail and I don't deserve it. But, what dangerous adventure are you talking about? You don't have to run any risk. It's not good tempting God doing such big things. I beg you. My lord. Melt your heart. My loved Dulcinea. I beg you not to deny me your protection. Now that my squire leaves me, the moon will be my only witness. You are very brave. But, melt your hard heart thinking... that by leaving you my soul will suffer... and I'll be close to the death. I'll follow my way and you can't do anything to persuade me not to want what heavens want. The fortune orders and the reason asks. You must leave me alone to fight against who... sullies the innocence and comes up with obstacles against freedom. But, sir... Leave me, the ventures that wait for me are hard and narrow the way of virtue. The insubstantial talks only move me away... from this path. I left my family to serve you. Thinking that I was worthy. But if you're too greedy you end up with nothing. And you have broken my hopes. Because when I was hoping to get the isle, I see myself in the middle of nothing. For heaven's sake, sir, don't make that to me. Why don't you want to abandon the adventure? Why are you so stubborn? If you love the danger you'll be burnt in it. Although you're rough and coarse you're still my squire. But I must follow my way on my own. I'll come back alive or dead. The rays of your beauty will light my intelligence and will give strength to my poor heart. Take this letter to my love. - Another letter? Milord... - Obey me, Sancho. Hurry up. I won't leave this area and I'll go up... the highest peaks to touch the moon, page of my misfortune. - Hurry up. - All right, I'm going. Don't forget eating with so many adventures. Hunger is more dangerous than the enemies you imagine. Don't worry, because, even if I have, I won't eat other thing that grass and fruits from the trees. Because what my idea is not to eat and to do... other things like that in the middle of this solitude. Sancho looked not for Dulcinea, but how to spend the time... for coming back with Don Quixote as soon as possible. He didn't know if it passed three, six, one hundred days or no one, because he didn't know that land. Don Quixote had pointed vaguely the address, recommending him to look for her in the palace of Alcarria. In spite of the imprecision, and to keep his word, he looked for Dulcinea in every village. Because he was sure that he was going to find her... anywhere except the Toboso. Because the name is not enough for being of a place. For instance, he wasn't from the Panza. Besides, his relatives from the Toboso didn't know any Dulcinea, although they knew Aldonzas. This is the place, oh heavens, that I choose for crying... the misfortune you have put me in. This is the place where my tears will increase the water... of this torrent and my deep sighs... will move the leaves of these wild trees. The testimony and signal of the pain my poor heart suffers. While he is in the mountains I must look for Dulcinea. Rustic gods that live in this uninhabitable place. Listen to the complaints of this poor lover, who a long absence makes unhappy. If I don't find her, bad. If I find her, worse. If I made a mistake, I'll be beaten by a cuckolded husband. Oh, Dulcinea of arrogant beauty. And he insists that she lives in the Toboso. Triads that live in the mountains. Listen to my pray. Although he says I can find her too... in a summer palace. For example, here. Because for him anything is a palace. But, even if she's here, who is she? Will she be one of these, or one of those? It's like looking a needle in a haystack. Maybe when he talked about his love, he meant that one, or that one, or that one of there. Maybe... not. Surely it'll be an old woman like that one, from who he has a good memory. Well, let's find her. Oh, lonely and dry trees that accompany my loneliness. Tell me with the movement of your branches... that you don't find my presence unpleasant. Take note of my loved Dulcinea's condition. Her country is the Toboso. Her quality at least of princess for being my queen and lady. And her beauty superhuman. Her hands are ivory, her skin, snow. And the parts hidden by honesty, are such ones that only the discreet consideration can praise them and not compare them. After looking for Dulcinea light-heartedly and unsuccessfully, Sancho returned to the place where Don Quixote was. And, surprisingly, he didn't find him. Moved by so irresistible impulses as big was.. His chimera, Don Quixote was going toward south, obeying to his particular sun. Somehow, Sancho knew this, and far from thinking... that something bad could have happened to him, he just follow his track. Oh, princess of my dreams, loved Dulcinea. Listen, rustic beasts, the beating of my heart... when I mention her name. Or the love has no sense or it has too much cruelty. Or my pain is not equal to the occasion that sentence me... to the hardest torment. Good morning. Did you see a very tall guy, thin, with moustache? - Look in the village. There's a circus. - He is not in the circus. He's a great sir, but with the moustache and the beard he looks... - What a jerk! - He has a pointed beard. We haven't seen anyone. - Have you? - Let us work. Go away if you don't want me to hit you with a stone. Goodbye. Although they didn't know it and for different reasons, they both were in Andalucia and very close. But they didn't find each other. There, Sancho could earn some money, working in a shooting. Action. To the right, you're out of frame. To the right, to the right. Cut. We've finished. What's this? I've always feel fascination for this land. And I'm trying to reflect the virtues of this people long time ago. Its vices too, but especially its virtues. The characters of Don Quixote and Sancho resume both sides. Don Quixote has always been considered a funny figure. Someone that went crazy reading chivalresque novels. But he is really a knight. An authentic knight. When you know him, you know he is the most perfect... knight of all times. Who has defeated giants with a wooden spear, helped maids bewitched by infernal beings, repaired affronts and solved problems with so much heart... and so little resources. Just an old and thin horse and a squire. Because the great myth is Don Quixote. But Sancho is the great character. A wonderful character even in his clumsiness. Together they've got around centuries of repression and tyranny. Together they've resumed a landscape that we sincere... people feel the temptation of identify with. A marvellous landscape that in spite of the aggressions... of tourism and the development plans, is still alive. Or at least, that's what I think. The moon for two pesetas. The moon for two pesetas. Admire the moon for two pesetas. The moon for two pesetas. Can I look through this thing? If you don't pay, not. No, I can pay as anyone. - Then pay. - How much is it? - Two pesetas. - Here you are. Put you eye in the hole. I know this kind of machines. Here? Of course. Get closer. Put your eye nearer. Nearer. Just an eye. This is not for croos-eyed people. If you like this thing, I sell it for five thousand pesetas. The General?simo visited this morning the works... of the reservoir of the Jiloca in whose building... the national engineering shows its importance. Accompanied by don Manuel Fraga, Adolfo Suarez and other authorities, the head of state inspected the troops that received him with honors. The North American army has made a manoeuvres, that have showed the technological advances... of the brother nation, like the new missile sea-air. Missile sea-air? Sources close to the NASA, builder of the missile, pointed that the modern remote control devices... that it has, let notice an important advantage... in the space race. The NASA announced officially... the launch of a rocket to the moon. The cameras recorded the moment the missile hits the target, fact that happens in a 100% of the cases. Its high reliability, long-range and efficacy made of the new missile... the ideal weapon in a war against the URSS. The wine association of Jerez, has conferred in a moving act, the medal of Honorary Member upon the famous filmmaker... known for "The third man", Orson Welles. An important wine-producer from Jerez, was the responsible for... conferring this honorific award. To Orson Welles, God bless him and let him live a lot of years... for drinking wine from Jerez. Here you are this medal, man. It's amazing that with that strange name, he was such a good friend of Spain. He knows better than anyone the art of bullfighting, the flamenco and the Spanish wine. Give me a hug, man. The famous filmmaker says goodbye this way to the land of Andalucia... that has open its arm to him during the shooting of his new film. Mr. Welles received the tribute from the people of Jerez... from the civil governor's granddaughter. Orson Welles, you're as big artist as big person... from head to feet. Orson Welles will start a journey towards Pamplona, where he'll continue the shooting of Don Quixote, adaptation of the celebrated novel by Cervantes, that tells the hilarious adventures of the famous nobleman and his squire Sancho Panza. Bulls. In the fourth bullfight, the torero Antonio Ordo?ez... You have a fine for parking the cart in a forbidden place. But what do I know. I've left the cart there all my life, Times change. Would you give me the telescope for one hundred pesetas? Okay, but take it fast. Before I regret it. Don Quixote said that the moon would be his witness, then it'll know something about him. And they are sending rockets there... I can't see anything. Maybe later. More or less in these days, Teresa Panza received for the... first time and the last in her whole life a letter from Sancho. Sancho felt lonely without Don Quixote. And distressed by the necessity of talking to someone, he wrote to his wife. The postman. Come. Today I've letters for many. Mar?a Gonz?lez. Letter from Aaiun. Juana, your husband wrote to you again. Teresa Panza has a letter today. Teresa, you have a letter. - Felipa Mart?nez. - Thank you very much. Don't you have anything for me? You know that they can't write from prison. Don't wait for a letter from your father, it's the same. Give the letter to Teresa. She'll have a fit. Here you are this lout's letter. A letter of Sancho... Dear Teresa and dear children: I expect you're okay, as I am, thanks God. But I'm not well alone. I mean I miss you a lot. Especially now that my good master Don Quixote is lost. I know that you have to work very much. That you haven't received many from me since I'm working... with Don Quixote, but he's an important man, and is going to make me governor of one of his many islands. Then I'll bought the things you deserve. You'll receive some money I've won making films. Because there's a man that want to make one with my master and me. That's to say, we're going to be famous. I told our address and maybe one of this day go there those men. Then, go to the fattest man. You can't miss him. And you ask him for some money to appear in the film, because they have a lot of money. You can't imagine the changes that there are in the city. They have made some machines that are like the radio, but, at the same time, you can see what's happening. This letter is written by the priest of Almagro, who send you regards. I've nothing more to tell, goodbye, I love you. You're husband Sancho. - Look at him. What's he doing? - They're going to destroy him. He's like Sancho Panza. He's drunk. You, de one with de hat. Go away, they are going to beat you to a pulp. - But, what happens? - Where did he come from? What are you waiting for? Is there a procession? What a beasts. It takes guts, doesn't it? Come with me. Do you know where is a square box where people talk? Your head? Goodbye. Do you know where is a box with a knight that plays music and...? - The musicians will know something. - Thanks, goodbye. I'm looking for a box that says the news, but at the same time you can see and there's music. Have you seen it? Maybe the music professors. Professor. If you know everything you'll know that... in the box of the news talked about my master. He's tall and with a strange beard and moustache. I'm looking for an old man tall and thing with a long beard. Boys, have you seen an old man very tall with a long beard? The taller are over there. - Boy. - Get lost, you pain. Pain, me? I wish you... Friend, have you seen a man with a long and white beard? Make way, I'm going to run you over. But, there's a guy inside here. - Listen, the little one who is here. - Leave me alone. - Listen, have you seen...? - Do you want me to beat you? You're musicians, aren't you? Have you seen a man with beard...? With beard, many, but also without beard. You must know it. A guy like you... You seem to be clever, have you seen a very tall guy? Mine is very special. Have you seen a man with beard and metallic chest. Haven't you seen the box of news? News? You shouldn't drink so much. I'm looking for my master. He's very tall and has a beard. Maybe he's Santa Claus... Come back on December. He's crazy. Wait. The bulls are in the bullring. - Do you work here? - What's the matter? You must know a little box that says the news. I'm looking for my master and the box talks about him. That's the Newsreel, man. Policeman, I'm looking for a box that talks about an old man. - Move along, please. - I knew it. I'm looking for my master. They talk about him in a box... Take care, man. Young, have you seen a box? They talk about the moon and then... No. Sorry, sir. I'm looking for my master and they talk about him in box. I have a box like that at home. When you open it, it plays music and gives you a cigarette. Why don't you express yourself better? A little box like this. No idea. You seem to be intelligent. I'm looking for a dark box, almost black, full of noises. You've got all that you want in the funerary. Very funny for being in a festival. Have you seen a big and dark box, with noises... and with strange images? It's not going to eat you, man! Have you seen a noisy box that tells the news...? Where can I find a box that talks about the moon... and about a man with metallic chest? No idea. Hello. Good evening. Are you foreigners? - Of course. What do you want? - Ask them where is my master. Who is your boss? There aren't masters anymore. I understand you too. He understand me. I don't need you. If you want to work in the film, talk to Mr. Welles. - His secretary. - It's me. You're late. He has found the character for his film. He's fantastic. But he's too crazy. So keen to fight and to solve affronts... You're talking about Don Quixote. We don't know if it's him. He has attacked the camera with a spear. - Where is he? - That man is in the moon. In the moon... And the poor Sancho worked in vain with that machine... that wasn't made to satisfy wishes. If he could have focused it towards his heart, he'd have found there the image of his master. Sorry, have you seen a box...? These don't know anything. Hello. Don't you see that you don't let the giants advance? What giants? There he is. Go away. Don't interrupt. Don't you see we're working? Stop a moment. One moment. You had to tell me where my master is. - Your master is in the warehouse. - In the warehouse? With the old things. Go on, don't notice him. Listen... Mr. Sancho. You forgot this in the guesthouse. The telescope. You've forgotten the telescope in the guesthouse. Give way. Don't you hear me? Stop, you've left this. You've left the telescope. Go to hell! My good Sancho. I thought you've abandoned me fore ever. And that I have to fight alone against everybody. They have locked me up in here. They're many and very strong and had war machines. I fought against them. But they dominated me and locked me up in this prison. But sir, that can't be. The responsible is the wizard Freston, allied with... the evil wise man that tells my heroic deeds. We can't fight against this, Sancho. This is a cart. Not a prison. Nobody can leave you here. The destiny of the knight of the sad figure is fulfilled. Sir, listen. I'm not going to let you stay here locked up. I'll take you out of this cart and I'll take you home. I promise. I'll take you out of here. Even if I succumb to the men that have locked you up. I'll save to you. Believe me, sir. Do you want to fight against the merchants of dreams? You're just a poor squire. And so what? What does it matter? I've got the weapon of the words and the strength of reason. And now everybody is going to listen to me. You, lazybones that are there dancing. Listen to me because I'm Sancho Panza, squire of the famous knight Don Quixote de la Mancha. I don't know what reason had you... to lock up here the nobler of all noblemen. But he is there, laid up, while you have fun. None of you, be sure, it's worthy of taking off my master's shoes, even if he's crazy. But, be careful, because, believe me, you will have to answer to God... for having locked up to my master Don Quixote. That's all. I thank you for your words and your effort. But it's useless. Because you must know that my enemies have cast... very new spells to reduce me to nothing. - I know you could escape. - You can't escape your destiny. I saw you solving hardest situations. Don't forget that after the storm there is calm. And after prison, freedom. And after misfortune, fortune. Don't you want to go out searching new heroic deeds... for offering it to the beautiful Dulcinea? Ay, Sancho. Dulcinea is not a beautiful lady, and I'm not the knight you think I am. What have this people made to our master? He, always ready to fight and with such a clear idea of things. Don't you think you're exaggerating, friend Sancho? Maybe, but, and him? He's logic. We have had so much fun together. Okay, he has no money and all you can get is hunger and problems. But he's the only sir I've met in all my life. They say he's crazy. But crazy and saint is maybe the same. I'll take him out of there, even if he doesn't want. All night long, Sancho didn't sleep a wink looking for... a way of giving his master back his hopes and strength. Feeling that Don Quixote was only locked up by... his sensation of failure, he thought the way... of making him forget those black ideas. He invoked the moon, as his master did so many times. And the moon, answering to his noble wishes, gave him a good part of the answer. Milord, listen to me. I've come to take you out of here. Sancho, my enemies won't let me get out of this prison. You mustn't resign yourself. You have to see many things. I've been in the big city and I've seen gigantic festivals, and incredible and wonderful inventions. There's nothing new under the sun. There isn't? There's a box in which you can see and listen to things. And it says that the rockets will reach the moon. And I believe it, sir, because... I saw them destroying ships and planes. The moon is dead, friend Sancho. Would you like that we go to the moon together? You've become a dreamer. The guards are sleeping. The way is clear. I'll pay your efforts obeying you. Let's go. Now we'll take one of those rockets. We will get up and to the moon. We'll take Rocinante and my donkey. And we will look for that problems you like so much. I've been looking at the moon in a 'telesfore'. I assure you that in the moon there are a lot of plains... to come and go as you like to do. I've released you, haven't I? And later you'll complain about your squire. Why are you taking me to my village, Sancho? We'll go to your home to take some things and we'll go right away. You can't go to the moon without your luggage, sir. Are you trying to fool me to lock me up in my home? No. Just the time to have a bath, that's all. I don't want to go home. Let me go, you traitor. You're going to hand me over to those miserable again. You must be the damned Arcalaos. The enchanter that has taken my squire's figure. Leave me, you villain. Sir, I just want you to have a rest and then to the moon. You've lied to me, scoundrel. You've made a pact with all the wizards that hate me. But I dare to say: Stop, you damned giants. Don't laugh at who is more valiant than you are. Sancho. Where are you? Listen to me. Don't you think that this is the moment... for us to retire to a peaceful life? We should stop rushing around. You're time of fighting is over. Now you must retire. I can't lose my time listening to silly things. Knights like me always look for fame and... Don't talk nonsense. We've spent a lot of time doing this kind of things, but I don't have yet the isle you promised me. And was looking forward it. Now lift your arm. Foulmouthed. Before your greed interrupted me... I was saying that the knights-errant... that go all over the world, not only look for fame, but also for justice, because that is the religion we've embraced, Sancho. Speaking of religion. Could you dissolve me one thing? You mean resolve. I mean what I mean, sir. Yesterday, a humble friar was canonised. It isn't then better being a simple friar than a knight? The friars look in heaven for the good of the earth. And what look the knights for? The glory. What is more, to resuscitate a dead person or to kill... a giant? Because if the churches are packed with devote people, we must believe that the one that heals ill people... and resuscitate dead people is better than the knight. You're right. Saints have an nobler trade but knight's trade... is much more full of sacrifice. Then, why should we keep on suffering? Because to achieve glory you have to suffer sorrows, anxieties and blows. And hunger and lice too. Heavens wanted me to be born in this Iron Age, to resuscitate in it the Golden Age. I'm the one who are reserved the dangers for. But also the great deeds, the valiant actions. I am the one who will resuscitate the round table, the 12 of France and the 9 of Fame. And any kind of famous knights-errant. Like this? We'll have to fix this because you have a terrible look. - Wait. I'll be right back. - Where are you going? I've decided, Sancho, that we're going to visit Dulcinea, to the Toboso, before undertaking the adventure in the moon. But wasn't Dulcinea Aldonza? Listen. Whoever she is, respect her. Because he deserves to be the queen of the universe. The highest princess in the earth. And since I lover her, I only have to think she's beautiful. I'd say she's ugly and smells bad... Are other knight's ladies better? No doubt. You're wrong, Sancho. For them their ladies are beautiful and honest... like for me is Dulcinea in a high grade. Excuse me, but Aldonza is not like that. You bray like a donkey. - Decorate me too. - I'm not the wizard Frest?n. When you talk about Aldonza, you seem to be him. Dulcinea is beautiful between beautiful and honest too. And if not, I imagine that she's exactly... like I say she is. And I paint her in my imagination like I want. In beauty and importance. And if that disturbs the ignorant, it'll please the severe. Are you sure this village is the Toboso? Yes, sir. I came before to hand in the letter. Follow me, sir. Come over here, that's not a street. This villages are changing very fast. They modernize so fast that you lose yourself. You'll be soon at Dulcinea's feet. Are we in the Toboso? I wouldn't like to be in the wrong place. Because you'll have noticed that all the things in... knight's world seem chimeras and mistakes. And that all they are made upside down. I know, sir. But, although I'm a donkey, I assure we're right. Over there. For this we must blame a group of enchanters, that put upside down all our things. It's better that I had alone to see if Dulcinea is in palace. I've got relatives and friends in the village. They'll know it. I'm dying to see her, Sancho. Uncle Sancho is here. - Are you leaving? - Stay with us. Goodbye, Sancho. See you, Macario. Where is Manolo? And the flute? It's Sancho. Have you seen? Here's Sancho, Matilde's son.. Come on, the party is going to start. - Listen. - What's the matter? - Have you seen Don Quixote? - Who? Don Quixote, the knight of sad figure. He has a spear and a horse. What do you want? I'm looking for Don Quixote, he has a beard. - Is he old and ugly? - Yes. You must know him. He's very thin. - Just the opposite to you. - You know him. Let's see if we're talking about the same man: Tall, with beard... an antique and broken armour. May the Lord help you, sisters, help me. Where can he be? Look who is there. - I know him. - It's Don Quixote. He's Don Quixote. It wasn't announced in the festival program. Look. Don Quixote. - I know him. - Wasn't he in that book? - It's Don Camilo! - Don Quixote. Hello, hello. Look at this piece of junk. We've defeated the kingdom of Noguelza. You won't be here long, Saracen. This is a message from the good king Don Jaime. Tremble, Saracens. Jeez, look who is he. - Don Quixote. - Don Quixote is there. It's Don Quixote. For Allah. For Don Jaime. Back, you scoundrel. Back. Satan's Saracens. Stay back. - Down the king Don Jaime. - I defy you, vile coward. Hello everybody. Thank you, thank you. Sir, wait. Give me your hand. Thanks, boys. We're very happy of this welcome. But we have to go. Wait for me, Don Quixote. What do you think, sir? We're famous. Are you again with this machine? Yes, of course, Sancho. It's a very important moment and I don't want to miss it. There are again that wretched instruments... with their insomniac lens and sad memory. You released me from prison to hand me to them. Don't you see he's the wizard that's telling our adventures? Blessed centuries those that lacked of these... hateful instruments, whose inventor must be in hell as a reward for... his diabolic invention. I'm about to say that I'm sorry for having undertook... the exercise of knight errant, in such a hateful age... like this in which we are living. Because, although I'm not afraid of any danger, I'm suspicious thinking that one of that wretched devices... can stop me from becoming famous... thanks to my courage and the blade of my sword. Because they turn the false into true and the true into false. And you must know, Sancho, I'm not against... progress and modernity. I'm not against that the rockets that go to the moon, place of poetry and that you proposed me to visit. The evil is in the human being, for becoming a slave of those despicable machines. Come on, Sancho. Maybe in the moon there's a place for a knight-errant. Long live Don Quixote! Long live Don Quixote! This film was written, produced and directed by a man... whose ashes, according to his last wishes lie in Spanish land, His name was Orson Welles.
