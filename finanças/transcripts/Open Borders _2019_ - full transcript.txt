- Wow. Every day there's more bodies. - They're trying to send us a message. - What's the message? Pales don't survive? - Give up or die. - Think we'll survive? - Oh, we'll survive. It just might not be here. - Don't move, Pale. - Looks like they got someone. - Scrag Rebel Enforcement. - Don't resist. - Looks like some of Malik's men. - Hold her, let's go. - Come on. - General Malik. - Yes Madame President. - I heard you had some trouble today with some rebels in Quadrant 57. - Yes, Madame President. - We can't allow these rebels to continue to thwart our efforts. Our anti-Pale programs are working with great effectiveness but this resistance must be stopped. - It will be, Madame President. - I'm counting on you to crush this resistance, General. You are paid to destroy rebels. Total elimination must be achieved. - I assure you Madame President, we will take care of this. - Good, that's what I want to here. - I can't wait to kill the Pales. - Yeah man. - We can't be outdone by a couple Pale rebels like this. The President has upped the bounty to 100,000 Scrag coins for each Pale rebel killed and 250,000 for each rebel female Pale submitted to the breeding program. So we're gonna produce, do you understand? I said do you understand? - Sir, yes sir. - So go out there and do it. - Sounds like somebody's waking up. - Yeah? - Oh my god, who are you guys? - My names Jam, this is Bronson. What's your name? - Missle. Thanks for saving me, I thought they were gonna kill me. - Pales can't go out in the daytime like that. - But I needed some food. - They only want you for one reason. - They want us for one reason too and it's not very happy. At least they want you alive. The President has passed a new Harmony Law stating that any Scrag that marries a Pale gets 100,000 Scrag coins. - It's an anti-Pale program designed to wipe us all out. - God. Is this really happening? - Yeah it is. They've been brainwashing people for years with this Scrag-Pale coupling propaganda. We got a lot of miles to travel so you two should probably go get some rest. Oh hey dad. - Bronson. Can you sit down for a minute? I need to speak with you. - What do you need? - Well right now I need you to sit. - Son, with the formation of Scragland and the purging of the Pales that they think are a threat, we're not gonna be able to stay here much longer. - What do you mean? - Massive persecution is next. - Really? I don't think so, dad. - Trust me, we need to move somewhere. Somewhere away from the Scrags. - And where would that be? - Well, I think it could be in the Hinterlands. - The Hinterlands? - Yeah, the Hinterlands. So I need you to go out there and check it out. That way I won't raise any red flags by missing any work. - I don't think so, dad. Do you know how crazy that sounds? We don't need to go out there. We can work within the system. What are they gonna do, kill all the Pales? - Maybe, yeah. - Come on, dad. - Look, we need to go out there and check it out, explore all our possibilities. If it's safe, then we can set up a new society. If it's not, then... - I don't think it's necessary. I think we'll be fine right here. - Son, I need you to go okay? For us. - No, you know what? Look dad, if you want to go, then go yourself, I'm not going. - Don't move, hands in the air, let's go. Move. Let's go. Down. Down on the ground. Hands behind your back, cuff him. - Bronson, are you all right? - Yeah. Thanks for asking. Looks like we need some gas. We're gonna have to go to Micah's. Angel, hey Micah, how's a going? - Crazy as usual. I can't get away from them Scrags. I moved out here just to get away from them all and now, we're surrounded by 'em. They are everywhere, I just hate 'em. - I hear you, brother. - You boys on your way back home? - Yeah. - You guys still living in that old abandoned house? - Yeah, it's peaceful out there. Unfortunately we had a run-in with Rebel Enforcement and ended up saving a female Pale. - That's what I call true citizenry. You know I've saved a few myself, ain't that right Evette? - You betcha, Micah. - We gotta save and protect our women. - Yeah, how you been Angel? - Good, good, you know, just trying to stay one step ahead of these Scrags. - I hear you, Rebel Enforcement's getting tougher and tougher every day. - There you go, Angel. - Thanks for the gas, Micah. Enjoy the fresh meat, brother. Bronson. Try to stay out of trouble, all right? - I'm trying, brother. Glad he's on our side. - Yeah. Me too. Pull your car up here. Gas is getting pretty scarce in these parts. - Can we get out of the car for a couple minutes? - Sure. - Well hi there Jam. - What's up, Micah? - Who's your new friend? - She's... - My name is Missle. - Well that's a powerful name for a pretty girl. - Thank you. - Hey Jam. - Hey. This is Missle. - Hey. - Nice to meet you. - So what do I owe you, old wise one? - Ah, this one's on me. - Thanks Micah, appreciate it. You're a godsend. - No, no, no. I'm just an old friend of your father's. - That you are. - Bronson, your dad was a great man. You can't keep blaming yourself for what happened. - Then who am I gonna blame? He wanted me to go and I didn't go. His death was my fault. - He believed in you and you may not believe in yourself but one day, one day you will. - I don't know, Micah. I'm starting to think that we can live safely among the Scrags. - Can we? I'm not so sure. - Yeah. - Y'all be safe. - Yeah. - How did all this start? - It was pretty innocent at first. People elected socialists to the government. They enacted Hate Speech Laws condemning any speech that went against anything that they had to say. People went to jail and that was the end of free speech. - That's crazy. - That was just the beginning. Then they started tearing down the monuments and saying that we needed a new Constitution. - Why? - Because they were written by slave owners. Thomas Jefferson, George Washington. So, they got rid of it and wrote a new one. - Then they got rid of the flag and the National Anthem too. - As soon as Americans lost all their rights, they went door to door and physically confiscated all the weapons, saying they would be safer without 'em. - Yeah, right. - I can't believe all this, I've never heard any of these things. - Just a setup for what they really wanted to do. Get rid of all of our borders and when they did, millions of people flooded in from all around the world. - Here comes Scragland. - What's wrong with that? I thought that was a good thing. - No, not really because that many millions of people at one time, they come in and they have no understanding of America or her principles. Basically turning America into a Third World country overnight. - Well, that's crazy. - We need to find these rebels. Check all the highway video surveillances. Rebel Enforcement, Special Forces Division. Yes, one moment. Line one for you, General Malik. - Yes? Okay. Okay. Thank you. Let's go. - That's when things really got worse for the Pales. - What do you mean? - Well with that many Scrags in the country, they finally took over the banking system and seized all the money, all the land that the Pales had. A Pale couldn't even get a job unless it was working for a Scrag. Most Pales didn't even resist, they just joined the Scrag system. - How do you know all this? This isn't what I learned in school. - Because you were taught revisionist history where they rewrite history to fit their own worldviews. I lived through most of it and my dad, well, he told me about everything that happened before that. - What happened to your dad? - He was the one that said that we needed to leave the Scrag system and go out and start our own new free society in the Hinterlands and he wanted me to go and check it out. But I was too scared and I didn't go. So he went. They killed him and the dream of a new free society died that day with him. - I'm so sorry. - I miss him dearly. What about your family, where are they? - All my family was killed in the initial purge. Now I'm all by myself. Why can't they just leave us alone? - They don't want us here. - That's for sure. So where are you guys staying? - We're staying in an abandoned house. - There's more of you? - Yeah. I have a wife and a son. - What's your son's name? - Minor. - Do you guys mind if I stay with you tonight? - Sounds good to me. - I don't think you have any other choices right now. Something doesn't feel right. - What do you mean? - Come on. Somebody's been here. I'm going in here, you guys go that way. June? Baby? No! No! June, where are you, Jam? Minor, Minor. June! Jam! No! No. Oh. Why? Why? Yeah, all right ready, here it comes. All right, nice catch. Remember plant that foot back, bring that ball to your ear and then release. - Good job, come on, it's time for dinner. - Thank you. - You're welcome. Here you go, dear. - Thank you. It looks good. - Did you like playing catch today? - Yep, it was great. - He's gonna be better than you soon. - Oh, you just wait and see, you just wait and see. - I love you, daddy. - I love you too, son. I will never forget you, my son. - Sorry Bronson. What can we do now? - I don't know but if we stay here and do nothing, they win. But if we go after them, we could all be killed. - I'll do whatever you want me to. - The two of you need to stay here, you'll be safe. - What are you doing? - I'm gonna go hunt down some Scrags and get June back. - But what if they killed her? - They didn't kill her, she's too valuable. They probably kidnapped her to sell her to the government breeders. - What's this breeding about? - The Scrags like to breed with the Pales so that they can lighten their skin. They associate Pale skin with power, status and beauty. - That's crazy. - Yeah it is but that's what they believe. The Scrag government wants to absorb all the female Pales into their society system so they can make everybody light-skinned. That's why they kidnapped you at an early age to put you into their system, get you re-educated, use you up and eventually get rid of you. - What about the Pale males? - That's a whole other story. - It sure is. - Most men didn't go along with the absorption plan. So the Scrags had to come up with a different way to deal with it and that was to either A, re-education them and put them to work in the Scrag system or totally eradicate 'em. - That's where we come in. - For those of us who remain, we're basically just rebels to the state. We must be hunted down and killed. - It's not a pretty picture. - No, it's not. That's why the two of you need to stay here. You'll be safer because they're not coming back here because it's safe here. - Bronson, I'm not gonna let you go by yourself. June was like a mother to me. I can help you find her. - No way I'm staying here by myself. - Okay. Okay, if we're gonna do this, then we're gonna do this together. All right, let's go. - Hey honey, you want some of this? - It's my hometown, I can't believe how rundown it is. - It looks like crap. - You see that store? My dad used to take my sister and I into that store to get us candy when we were little. Missle, get down and stay down. We don't need any Scrags seeing you. Jam, put a blanket over her. - There you go, can you breathe okay? - Barely. - Jam, I'm gonna go over to that store and I'm gonna talk to Baheeb because if anybody knows anything around here, it's him. If I'm not back in 15 minutes, you guys get outta here. - Sure thing. Bronson. You'll be back. He'll be back. - Sure hope so. - What are you doing around here, man? - I just want to get some water. - What's the matter, you thirsty Pale? There ain't no water in there for you man but you know what? I got something for you, I got something for you right here. Come on Pale, you ain't got nothing to say? Get his stuff. Thanks for the tip. - Oh my, look what the cat dragged in. - Hey Baheeb. - What are you doing here? New government regulations, I told you I can't help your type anymore. - Can't or won't? - Both. - Have you seen some Scrags come in here with a woman with brown hair? - No. I have no recollections of that, I'm sorry. - Would 10,000 Scrag coins help your memory? - Perhaps but you never know. At my age, they say the mind is the first thing to go. Where are the coins? I think I saw a captive brunette with some Scrags last night in a pickup. - What direction were they headed? - Towards Planned-Opolis. - Wait, you need to pay for that candy! You crazy Pale. - I'll be out back. - Hey boys, what can I do for ya? - Hey Micah, we need some gas and a place to camp tonight. - Sure thing Bronson, my place is your place. Where you boys headed? - Planned-Opolis in the morning. - What's the occasion? - The other night they ransacked our house, they killed Minor and they kidnapped June. - What? I'm so sorry, Bronson. If there's anything I can do, you just let me know. - You're doing it. - Well if there's anybody that can find her, it'd be you. - Wow, what a ride. Where are we? - About halfway to Planned-Opolis. - This place is so pretty. - That's because the Scrags haven't been here yet. - Jam, take Missle and see if you can find some firewood. I'm gonna go see if I can find us a good place to camp. - Sure thing. - All right. - So, how'd you meet him? - When I was 10 years old, the Scrags came to my house and burned it down. My whole family burned alive. Before my mother died, she was able to throw me out of one of the windows. Bronson was a first responder, him and his wife nursed me back to life and I've lived with them ever since. They're my family. - Wow. That's an incredible story. I wish we could find a place to live away from all this. - That would be great, wouldn't it? - You think we'll find a place like that? - Yeah, we will. - So, what's your dream? - I don't know. I just want to find someplace we can all live in peace. Maybe raise my own family. - Oh, your own family? Who's the lucky girl? - I don't have a girlfriend. It's not very easy finding someone when you're always on the run. - I'm sure that's challenging and it's forbidden for Pales to mate together. - Yeah. But I am a renegade. Maybe I could break one of the laws. - I just want to live in peace with the people I love. - Me too, my lady. - Do you think it's possible? - Anything's possible. - But where? - Hey guys come on. Grab some wood, I found a place to camp, come on. - Man, it's so good eating real food rather than that crap from the Global Food Council. - Yeah it is, buddy. But not as good as June's, nothing's that good. - Do you think we'll find your wife? - We have to find her. - Do you think all Scrags are bad? - No. I don't think all Scrags are bad. Most maybe but just like I don't think all Pales are good but most are, it's a numbers game. - What do you mean it's a numbers game? - Numbers, statistics, I learned it playing sports. Statistics don't lie. All you gotta do is look at the true numbers and don't listen to what the people or the government tell you. - So how did they get that name, Scrags? - When the millions of people came in, they all wanted one common name that represented what they believed in. So they came up with the Single Community Representing All Globalists, SCRAGS for short. - Where did they all come from? - Oh. Millions poured in through South America, through Mexico. Muslims came in from the Middle East. Millions came in from Africa. Right then is when the United States of America collapsed into chaos. - So why do they call us Pales? - You sure are full of a lot of questions tonight. - This is all new to me. It's fascinating. I thought it was always like this, I didn't realize what had happened. - It's okay. You don't know 'cause it's not what you were taught. They didn't want you to know the truth. - What was that? - Bronson, it's Micah. - Micah, over here. - We just thought we'd come out and join our friends and brought a couple stragglers that were passing through. - Hey Angel, Evette, Johnny. Yeah, we were just finishing up dinner here and we'd love to have a drink with you guys. I was just telling Missle why it is they call us Pales. - Great story. Oh no no no, I brought here some of the good stuff. - Come on in. It's good to see you, Johnny. - Good to see you. - Lookin' forward to you playing us a long a little later. - I'll play ya a beauty. - So back to what I was saying, they call us Pales because of the cowboys and Indians. - They don't call me Pale. - The what? - We're called Pales because of the cowboys and Indians. When the European settlers came over to this country, they were called pale faces by the Indians and the pale faces later displaced the Indians, killed them, took their natural resources, stole their land and created the United States of America. - That really happened? - Yeah. The thing that we did to the Indians is now being done to us by the Scrags. We're the ones being destroyed, we're the ones being displaced. Our natural resources are being used and our land is being taken to create Scragland. - That's really scary. I wish we could find a home away from all this, a peaceful place like this. - Yeah. That'd be great. - John, go ahead and play us one of your songs. ♪ The water is wide and I can't cross over ♪ ♪ I neither have ♪ ♪ My wings to fly ♪ ♪ Give me a boat that can carry two ♪ ♪ That boat shall row my love and I ♪ ♪ For love is gentle and love is kind ♪ ♪ And love is sweet ♪ ♪ When first it's new ♪ ♪ But love grows old ♪ ♪ And waxes cold ♪ ♪ And fades away ♪ ♪ Like morning June ♪ ♪ There is a ship that's loaded deep ♪ ♪ She's loaded deep as deep can be ♪ ♪ But not as deep ♪ ♪ As the love I'm in ♪ ♪ I know not how I'll sink or swim ♪ ♪ The water is wide and I can't cross over ♪ ♪ I neither have ♪ ♪ My wings to fly ♪ ♪ Give me a boat that can carry two ♪ ♪ That boat shall row my love and I ♪ ♪ That boat shall row ♪ ♪ My love and I ♪ - That was so beautiful. - Thank you, ma'am. It's a song about heartbreak and love. - When we find June, then I think it's about time we head out to the Hinterland and make a new home for ourselves. - The Hinterland? We can't go out there. The government says there's radiation. - They're just saying that. The government is just saying that, I don't believe 'em. They're trying to build up their forces so they can occupy it and control it. So that they can expand it for the Scrags later. But for right now, they're just saying it's banned. - So, we're going there? - We should and Bronson's the one to lead us there. - I don't know that we can make it out there. But I sure would like to get away from all these Scrags. - Bronson, if you lead us, we'll follow you. - Yeah. And we can invite other rebels to join us. - Sounds like a dream. - It is. - Yes sir, it's some good stuff here I'll tell ya. - Run, Scrags. - I think we lost 'em. - I don't know, baby. - Bronson. - Jump in the car, they're coming. - Where's Missle? - Just get in the car. - Go. - Shoot 'em. Oh man, that was crazy. Good shooting, man. - Yeah. I'm glad we lost 'em. - I'm sorry we lost her, Jam. It was all my fault. - It's not your fault, it's their fault. They killed my family. They killed your family, June and Missle. They might both be dead. - I shouldn't have brought you two out here, okay? - I wasn't gonna let you do this by yourself. You're all I have left. You think we lost 'em? - I think we have for now. - General Malik, did you catch all the rebels? - No ma'am, we lost a couple of soldiers and the rebels got away. - Got away? I want every one of those rebels hanging, do you hear me General Malik? Hanging. - Yes, Madame President. That's what I do. - I don't think I need to remind you Malik that these Pales are a disruptive force that must be removed from our society. Their abuse of power and privilege must be terminated and you are the one in charge of ending it. Retributions must be made. - Yes, Madame President. I will find them and destroy the rebels. - Yes, find and destroy. Find and destroy. - What the heck is going on here? - This world would be such a beautiful place if everything that we loved wasn't being destroyed. - What do we do now? - We have to fight. We have to fight for freedom and we have to fight for survival. - You're right. We've gotta fight for our way of life. I can't take this. - We're gonna make it. - What was that? - It came from over here. It's okay friend, it's okay, it's okay. Who did this? - Scrags. - Where were you? - Planned-Opolis. - That's where we were headed, we were headed to the breeding center to see if we could find my wife June. - June. So beautiful. - Where did you see her? - Nurse, nursing. - Did you hear that? He said he spoke to somebody named June. Do you think it was my June? - Bronson, I don't know. - Let's go check out his car. - Poor guy. - Check the glove box. - The keys are in it. - Let's check the trunk. Wow. Look at that. If June and Missle are alive, the Scrags would've taken her right in here. - Wow, you're using the dead guy's uniform. How am I getting in? - You're not. - I'm not? I can help you find them. - I can't lose you, Jam. This isn't gonna be easy. I need you to stay here and be ready to go. - Okay. I'll be ready. - All right. - Watch it, Pale. - Come on, put your stuff down, hurry up. Hands up against the wall. Spread those legs. What are you standing there for? Come on, get your stuff. Let's go, let's go. - Get going, Pale. - Attention, this is a security zone. All personnel are subject to search. - Oh no. - Keep moving, Pale. - You're gonna like this. - Hi, I need to spray for bugs. - Y'all always late. Dang Pales. Here's a keycard to get in the rooms. You have strict orders to get in and get out. Do you understand me? - Yes ma'am. - And don't talk to any of the prisoners. - Yes ma'am. - Dang Pales. - Watch it, Pale. - June baby it's me, it's me, it's me. - Bronson? Oh my god Bronson, this place is horrible. - Don't worry baby, I'm gonna get you outta here. It's all right, it's okay. It's okay. - Attention, this is a security zone. All personnel subject to search. Come on, come on, come on. - Security breach, we have a female incubator missing from room 2042, get here now. - Wow, I can't believe you got her out. Where's Missle? - I'm sorry Jam, I didn't see her. There's thousands of women in there. - What the heck happened here? - A Pale male broke in and abducted one of the incubators, they escape in a black Supercharger. - What the? Radio all the Rebel Enforcement crew. Ask them to be on the lookout for a black Charger. Scour the city. - Missle? - Jam! - Stop the car, that's Missle. - What? - Go. I can't believe you're alive. - I thought I was dead. The Scrag government was committing me to the breeding center. Thank God you found me. - We gotta get outta here quickly. We need to head to the Hinterlands right now. - Do you think it's safe? - I don't know but we're gonna find out. - Anything's gotta be safer than here. - Yeah. Let's do it. - Madame President, we haven't found them yet. I believe they left the city. - Then look for them outside the city. I want those rebels found. - Do you think the Scrags will follow us out here? - Malik's bounty men would follow us to hell and back. But I don't think they'll find us out here. - Why do they hate us so much? - We should be coming to the Hinterland crossing. You guys ready for this? - Yes. - Absolutely. - I'm sure it'll be a whole lot better than Planned-Opolis. - Gimme a hand June baby. - Get me General Malik. - I feel better already, I do. - Me too, baby. - I wonder what we'll find out here? - I'm sure it'll be something wonderful. - Feels good to get away from all those Scrags. - Let's check this place out. Looks like we're coming up to something. Wow. - It's amazing. - It must've been a resort or something. Let's go check it out. Wow look at this place, it's perfect. - It's incredible. Wow. It's beautiful. - Yeah. - It's incredible, like a fairy tale. We could have a school here. - I could help you. - I know how to garden, we can raise our own food. We could have livestock. - I can't wait. Where do we even start? - It's an incredible place for us to build our new community but first we gotta be prepared for any type of attack. - Do you think they'll come after us again? - Yeah, they'll never leave us alone. Is that Angel? - What's he doing out here? - Oh, hey Jam, Bronson. - What are you doing out in these parts, Angel? - I was just... - Angel, it's General Malik. What do you have for us? - You radio back that you're here right now. - 10-four, I'm here. - Good job, let's hear it. - So you're the betrayer, you killed my son, kidnapped my wife and had my family attacked. - It wasn't just me. - We need to kill him, you maniac! - No, no, no, no. Get some rope, we're gonna tie him up. We've got work to do. So now all we have to do it wait. - Copy that. - So why'd you do it? - The money, it was too tempting. I don't believe in this country anymore. - You sold my family out for money? You traitor. - Oh my god, they're here. - Get out and move the signs. - I'm gonna release you, despite what you did. - It's an ambush, it's an ambush! - So this is our new home. A safe place where we can live and love and start our new lives. - This is awesome, you did it Bronson. - We did it, we did it and when we need supplies, we can go back into the city and raid for them. - And we can save as many women as we can. - Yeah and when the other rebels hear about it, they'll come and join us. - You can count on that. - You guys ready to get started? - Yeah. - Yeah. - All right let's go, come on. - Hey guys, come and look what I found. Come on. - What is it? - I don't know. I was just going through some stuff and came across it. It says Do Not Destroy on the box. - It sure is light. - Whoa. - Wow. - I've only seen those in pictures. - Is that real? - Yes it is. - Look, there's a letter in the box. "Dear friend, I hope you cherish this flag. "This is all we have left from our great country. "They've taken everything else from us. "We hope you feel the same faith "and freedom we did when you fly this flag. "God bless you and God bless America." - Come on. - Isn't it beautiful? - It sure is. I feel something. - I do too. What is that? - Freedom.
