[MUSIC PLAYING] [SCREAMING] [HORN BLOWING] Ladies, your prayers have been answered. Helsinki, gateway to the north. Well, it is. A toast to us. This might be our last trip together, guys, let's make it a good one. I'll drink to that. You'll drink anything, Sav. That's true. Listen to this, you guys. It says here that this square was built by the Russians over 100 years ago. Well, Russia's not far from Finland, you know? Just across the border. Yeah, it's already starting to feel like Siberia. Just wait until we get the lab lamp out. You're gonna be pissing icicles. This is great. This is it. This is it. What do you think? I like it. Man, I really like it. You know, it's like a cross between the Blues mobile and the Batmobile. Yeehaw. Right on, Let's go. You know, we should be at the Arctic Circle in about an hour. After that, we'll really be up north. Listen, you know, it says here that the trees and animals in the Arctic Circle are different than anywhere else in the world. You don't say? It also says that it can snow during the summer. Give me that book. What is this stuff, KC? Hey, come on. MITCH: What's this red line on the map? KC: That's' the border between Russia and Lapland. There's everything you need to know about Lapland in there. MITCH: Lapland? How about you, Savoy? You want to know about Lapland? Of course, I do. Tell me, how about the bars? They topless? It's a fucking tour book, man. I tell you, you ain't gonna find out in this book. You know what, KC? You really got to get rid of this cheap literature. Just-- the Arctic Circle. Polar circle, whatever. What is this? What are you guys doing? Just take a picture. Come on, man. Get in here. - Just take a little picture. OK. Come on, now smile. Give me that famous Mitch Shepard look, explorer extraordinaire in the Arctic Circle. Just take the picture. Hey, Hey, KC. Come on, let's go. Out of the car. I'm driving. Get out. Come on, you guys, you never let me drive. Oh, shit. Get in. Man, get the camera. Just get in the car. KC: Only about 150 kilometers left. MITCH: Still? What are you trying to do? Set up camp at the North Pole? SAVOY: You bet. I want to hand deliver my Christmas list. I can see why the Uncle wanted you, Savoy. Thank god you didn't join the army. All right. You know, maybe we shouldn't be using the gun so close to the border. Yeah? Well, if you're worried about it, why don't you go wait in the car? What? Walk for three miles back through the snow? Don't be a crazy person. All righty, Shep, this is for a beer. Put her on ice, pal. Good shot, Mitch. Come on, KC. Your turn. No way. Come on, KC, give it a try. Once a Boy Scout, always a Boy Scout. No more your cop outs. Come on, you've got to at least give it a try. SAVOY: Give it a try, KC. Prove your manhood. Well, all right, Mitch, if it makes you happy. Shoot the bow. Oh, shit. Ah, I've been hit. What'd I tell you? I can't do this. You know, you could do it if you really wanted to, KC. Well, maybe I don't really want to. [YELLING] All right, wait, wait, wait. Hold it. Hold it. Hold it. Super. OK, all right, just go with the moment. Go with the moment. - Am I getting heavy? That's beautiful. I love it. I love it. Hold it. Hold it right there. Oh, that's perfect. Let's get these bags. You guys are super. Limbo and plant your feet. Limbo all day. Limbo all night. Rum and Coca-Cola, you make it feel all right. You limbo all day. All right. You limbo all night. Hey, what you say? Rum and Coca-Cola, you make it feel good. Hey, what you say? I say this isn't a very good idea. Whoever said it was? You know, you pay us your money, and you take your chances. See Russia and die. This is ridiculous. You bet it is. I mean, imagine this. Every day, thousands of people cross the border to get out. We're crossing it to get in. See ya. You want to tell everyone that you're the first asshole ever to do it? No, no, no. I want to take pictures with your camera. This is the Iron Curtain? This is really something. You know, KC, I bet your pictures make the cover of "Time." Make the cover of "The Moscow Tribune" if you guys don't shut up. Just think about it. Only a couple hundred feet away, one of our fellow men there has never even tasted a Coca-Cola. They drink Pepsi here. Listen, I think we ought to get back. You go back if you want, KC. I'm going to check it out. Come on, Savoy, you can't be serious. Why not? I mean, who could object to a friendly little visit? Yeah. Remember crawling back from Baja last year? This place is a jogging path, man. No kidding. You guys suck. Let's move out. What if the clearing is mined? Then the whole area would be full of dead animals. Come on, move it. Hey, get down. [RADIO CHATTER] Bet you Brezhnev would love this. MITCH: He died three years ago. Four, Gumby. Just take it easy. Just get up and hand me the bag. Your tour book didn't say shit about this, KC. - Cut it out. - Ease up, Savoy. God damn it. Shit. It's gotta be automatic lights. Let's go. - Leave it. - I can't. He'll find it when it gets light. That'll be something new for him. Come on. Let's go. Let's go. Hurry up, KC. All right. Oh, shit. It's like guerrillas behind enemy lines. Hey, I wouldn't be such a hero, KC. Hell, we could have smuggled pregnant elephants across the border and nobody would have known the difference. - Come on. - Yeah. We're gonna have to hole up here and head back tomorrow though. That search light was a bit too close. Yeah, it cost me half my stuff and my camera's thrashed. Hey, just wait till those Russians get a smell of your dirty shorts. Oof, they're going to hate you. They're gonna hate your guts, KC. [SPEAKING RUSSIAN] Holy shit. Maybe we should just tell them we're sorry, and we didn't mean it. It was just a big mistake. Yeah, big mistake. We've got to find another point on the border to get across. [SPEAKING RUSSIAN] Let's go anywhere. We've got to get out of the area. Move. I'd sure like to know where in the hell this old truck is taking us. I think we're in deep shit. I mean, I know we're going south, but the map doesn't show any road. What do you expect, the fucking AAA? At least we threw the soldiers off the track. Great. We're gonna freeze to death in the back of this stupid truck and no one will know. If this is your idea of camping Scandinavia-- Look, you're the one that left your shit at the border. Shut up. You're the one that got us into this whole mess. Look, no one forced you to come along, little man. When are you going to learn to stand on your own two feet, huh? Look, if-- I said shut up, both of you. If you two don't start using your heads instead of your mouths, we're never getting out of here. We don't even know where the hell we are. I really think we had to find some local villager, a civilian or something, and get them to help us. [SPEAKING RUSSIAN] The bow. Shit. Where the hell's KC? MITCH: Take it easy. He's probably all right. He must have gone to the other barn. We'll look for him in the morning. Right now, we need some rest. Savoy. There's something going on outside. My gun. MITCH: Any sign of KC? Well, the people are gone. It's just one girl out there. We've got to try to talk to her. Please? Don't scream, please? We need your help. Mitch. Mitch. [SCREAM] Get her. [SCREAM] Please. Please, we won't hurt you. We won't hurt you. We need help. We didn't do anything wrong. But do you speak English? English? Of course, she does. Everybody does. How come she's not saying anything? - Oh. - Oh, shit. Got a Soviet citizen as a prisoner, she doesn't understand a god damn word I'm saying. What are we-- Mitch. Shit. [SCREAM] [SINGING IN RUSSIAN] Where are they? [SPEAKING RUSSIAN] These young Americans must know that they who took up the sword will die by the sword. Mitch, they think we killed the girl. [SINGING IN RUSSIAN] Savoy. [SHOUTING] Come on. Where's Savoy? Come on. [SPEAKING RUSSIAN] [CHAINSAW] [SPEAKING RUSSIAN] Savoy? Savoy. Come here. Come here. Savoy, what the hell's going on? Just give me that stuff. What the hell is she doing here? She saved our goddamn lives. That priest killed her sister. Go. MITCH: She's going to help us out of here. We got to stop that bleeding. I gotcha. You're gonna need some stitches though. Holy shit. Mitch, I think I found something. What? What is it? Dynamite. Dynamite? What the hell's dynamite doing in a country store? There's a mine close by. No, no. Get down. Get down. Stop, you'll kill the girl. Go, and I'll follow you. Hurry up. Let's go. [SPEAKING RUSSIAN] Well, put him in the back. Just get going. [SCREAMING] Oh, shit. We gotta go back. We got to get off this damn island. Look out. Come on, let's get out of here. Wait! We can't leave her here. We go back for her now, we're all dead. Come on. - Go. Come on. No, we can't leave her. No. - We have to. Let's go. SAVOY: For a little guy, you sure pump a lot of blood. There's a map in my left hand pocket. Irina gave it to me. What the hell this is. That's Russia, and the black line there's the river. MITCH: That's the Finnish border. SAVOY: Can't be more than 10 miles or so. MITCH: Going to be slow going with you out of commission, KC. Let's go. Almost there. What the hell is this? Wait a minute. [ALARM] [SPEAKING RUSSIAN] You were right, KC. Pepsi-Cola. I hope you choke on it, pal. [SPEAKING RUSSIAN] No. You fucking thug! No. No, you can't do that. [SPEAKING RUSSIAN] Oh, god. [SPEAKING RUSSIAN] Does it hurt? Could you just stop for a minute and tell us what's happening? No. Ah! Does it hurt? Does it hurt? Yes. It hurts. It hurts. Now, who volunteers to cooperate? Look, look, I'll speak for all of us. We've got nothing to hide. This whole business, it's just a big mistake. What about you? I'll cooperate. And you? No way, Jose. Excuse me? I said no way, comrade. You'll never get me to cooperate. Mitch, Mitch. Never. For god's sakes, will you shut up? We're American citizens. You can't kill us. I can't, huh? So you were just having a good time, no? We were. And then you just happened to infiltrate Soviet Union, dynamite a peaceful village, kill more than 10 of our soldiers. It wasn't our fault. Why are you in Russia? We were drunk. We just wanted to see what it was like. Where is the rest of your terrorist group? Terrorists? Where are the others? There are no others. We did get separated. We lost the others. You're attack on Vladimir village, you planned it, did you not? Yes. Yes, I planned it. As a part of Western campaign of terrorist attacks? Yes. Yes. That is better. Now, who are your contacts? The contacts were the border guards. No. - Wrong. Your contact was the girl in Vladimir village whom you left behind. Yes. You can't believe that shit. We really do have all the time in the world. No! [SPEAKING RUSSIAN] [SPEAKING RUSSIAN] Does anybody speaking English? English? Please, my friend needs help. He needs a doctor, fast. Please, he can't even eat. [SPEAKING RUSSIAN] Better carry him with us. [SPEAKING RUSSIAN] KC? KC. Mitch, we've got to do something. He's much too weak to work. My friend's very sick, and it's cold on the floor. He needs a bed. Don't you have any human feelings left? Do you hear me? Mitch. Mitch. Stop it. Mitch, let him go. Let him go. Please, leave him alone. I asked him for the bed. For once-- Please? SAVOY: Why'd you do that, Mitch? Why'd you do that? No, he doesn't know. [SHOUTING] Ow. [SPEAKING RUSSIAN] Where are you taking him? Somebody answer me. Your friend is very ill. He needs help. We need a doctor. You must go to Sergey. He's making business with anyone. His business is selling people. People like you. People like me. Here, he is a composer. Boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom. See, he wrote wrong notes. I play chess. They say I'm practicing. What the hell are you talking about? The chess game. Your other friend is already there, you know? See, deep below this prison, there is a secret place where the guards throw all the insane and violent prisoners. The guards don't care what happens there. They only want to get rid of these inmates who they no longer have control. They become wild, like animals. SAVOY: You can't be serious. PRISONER: In this place, they play a chess game where humans act as chess pieces. When you lose, you die. It's madness. A nightmare. A world where death is the sole source of amusement. Sooner or later, we all find up there. They throw us in here and don't tell us a goddamn thing, and the one person who speaks my language, he's a lunatic, and he can't stop talking about a game of chess. PRISONER: It only seems like we all have different sentences, but they are really all the same. Very few ever get out of here. Maybe you're the lucky one, my friend. Perhaps you will find yourself home again. Maybe tomorrow, just like that. SAVOY: Just leave me alone. You're out of your mind. PRISONER: Yes. I know you think I'm crazy, but there is one very special prisoner living here. Hardly anyone knows him, but I know him very well. He was a, what you call it, a soldier of fortune. He has fought many wars for causes he believes in. He is not like us. He has lots of dollars and in here, that's the only power. You might be the prisoner he's been waiting for. He needs a messenger, and if you prove your strength, he might send for you. We call this man the Admiral. The Admiral also speak your language. What? I must go now. My friend needs a doctor. Doctor is impossible. They said you could sell anything in here. For a doctor, one must pay dollars. Who the hell has dollars in here? No one. Only the Admiral. The Admiral? Yeah, one who has dollars. So all I get with this is cabbage soup? You are a young man and healthy, you can buy with this something else. [SPEAKING RUSSIAN] [SPEAKING RUSSIAN] Get away. [SPEAKING RUSSIAN] Irina? Irina! Let her go. Irina! How much more of this time can we take? I know it isn't easy for you Mr. Brown, but these things take time. The embassy only just discovered that you were here. You don't know what it's like. They took Mitch down to some basement, and KC's not going to make it. Calm down. The embassy has asked me to try to get you out of here, but it isn't going to be an easy task. The Soviets are convinced that you and your two companions are part of some gigantic Western plot. I swear to God, we did what we had to do. The village people, they accused us of killing a girl. They were going to kill us. And those confessions, those confessions are crap. That freak from the KGB, he would have burned Mitch alive if we didn't sign them. And no one here believes you when you're telling the truth. Well, you must admit that the truth in this case is a bit hard to swallow. But it's still the truth. We're not terrorists. If we were, you would have been here six months ago. You must understand, Mr. Brown, that I have no official connection with the United States government. They simply asked me to see what I could do. Please, if KC doesn't get to a doctor, he's going to die. You trust me. I'm doing the best I can under the circumstances. How you feeling? Savoy, do you really think that he can? Of course, he can. I mean, the American government sent him, didn't they? I just can't believe it. I just knew we'd never see our families again. Well, at least they know we're alive. What about Mitch? Don't worry about it. We'll find him. Just hang in there, kid. He'll get us out. [SPEAKING RUSSIAN] Think of us when we're gone, skinhead. We're going to be out enjoying the sunshine. You'll be in here rotting away till you die. The caviar, as usual, is excellent, but the trade that you propose is out of the question. Do you really expect us to believe that it was just a childish escapade? But that's precisely what it wants. Believe me, Anatoly, our intelligence community has never heard their names before. The most that you can get for them would be the writer that defected to Sweden. I don't even remember his name. And we should like to talk about our chemist friend, Tarkoff. Yes. Yes. I'm sure you would, but, you see, the boys aren't worth that much to us. We are delighted that you people in Moscow aren't going to make a fuss about this case, and well, as for us, our government would be just delighted if those boys simply vanished from the face of the earth. Russia is a big country. Now, would you care for a little of our special dessert? That's a splendid idea. [SPEAKING RUSSIAN] Come here, my dears. [SPEAKING RUSSIAN] Do they speak English? Oh, yes, the little one does. She studied at the Institute in Leningrad until her Western activities. I did not want you to feel that your trip here was a complete waste of time. Waste of time, never. My superiors just simply wanted me to assess the situation. We can't let these little incidents upset relations between us, can we? [SPEAKING RUSSIAN] Don't be afraid. What's your name? Nadja Kirakova. Nadja. [SPEAKING RUSSIAN] Get her out of here. [SPEAKING RUSSIAN] I've found her, but it will not be easy. Where is she? Very difficult. Listen to me, slime, I gave you everything I had. But not enough. Too dangerous. Too dangerous. Wait. KC? KC, wake up. We've got to talk. Your friend is dying, and you want only to see girls. I want only to help. I'll be right back. Quickly, we had only a short time. Irina? I have to tell you something. No, please, it's just so wrong that you ended up here too. Please, listen to me. Wait for the Admiral to contact you. Don't trust anybody else. Nobody. No, Irina, you're wrong. There's an American. He's a liar. He treats people like animals. You're not Irina. Irina's dead. You're lying. She was to weak to take it anymore. She took her own life to find peace. Don't let them get to you. Only Admiral can help you. But who's the Admiral? Who are you? I'm Nadja. I'm a friend. I was also her friend. Shut up, you two. You'll wake up whole prison. We must go. No, please, don't go. Come closer. Let me touch you. Be brave, Savoy. Please, hold me. Don't give up. Please, just for a minute? Please, I need somebody. Just forgive me that I can't help you more. I have to go. [HUMMING] You deserve a better world, little American. Sh. Sh. Sh. Sh. Sleep well, my little friend. KC? KC, I've met a girl. Why don't you have a shirt on? You're gonna catch a cold. KC? Oh, god. Oh, god. Follow me, quickly. Oh, no. No kill him. American. Quickly. Tunnel. My latest treasure. Do you believe I found it here in this pigsty? I'm the Admiral. It's time you learned a few things. My name is Savoy Brown. I know. Sit down. I heard about your friends, the Russian girl, KC. You know about KC? Only those strong enough to believe survive. KC would not have made it. I've been here for six months. I've heard all about you. So what are you doing here? My activities in the past have infuriated many. You may not know this, but like you, various government agencies, including the CIA, find me something of an embarrassment. They prefer me dead. But as you can see, my American countryman, I'm very much alive and well, considering the circumstances. Most of my life, I spent fighting other people's wars. Those conflicts no one wants to talk about, which take place all over the world every day. I thought I was fighting for America, for freedom. Now I know better. No one would think of looking for me here. I'm writing a book exposing the dirty work governments do, supposedly in the name of peace. The CIA, KGB, they're all the same. They start these stupid little wars to prove their own power. The American people have the right to know the truth, and for that to happen, Savoy, you must help me. But I just killed a man. I know. If the guards find you, we'll never be free. So in exchange for helping me, I'll get you, the girl, and Mitch out of here. Where is Mitch? What have they done with him? He's in the game now. It's a world of its own. And there are no guards, there are just the rules of the game. You can only stay alive as long as your winning. Kapsky, my eyes and ears in this prison, is the chess master. He feels he's ready to play the game. He's just crazy enough to think he can win. It's like a living hell there. It's the death sentence, and they play for keeps. Don't be surprised. You won't know your friend Mitch. He's cracked right down the middle. He has forgotten what was before. Like everybody else now, he wants to be the king. The king gives the commands. The king has to keep winning. It's survival of the fittest. Savoy, to save Mitch before he loses the game, you'll need more strength than ever before. To prepare for the escape, I'll give you a place to stay. No one must know you're there before the time has come. We'll need a lot of preparation, maps, weapons, even duplicate keys. Freedom has its price, and you must pay it. [SPEAKING RUSSIAN] I've drawn you a map of the prison. I want you to study it. Here is the armory, the motor pool. Follow this sewer and you and Mitch will find your way out. Did you make the keys according to my instructions? Good. Are you sure that Mitch and the Russian girl are still alive? - Uh-huh. I have a Russian uniform for you to wear. We're all set. I'm ready. We don't have much time. Now do as I say, and we'd all be out of here tomorrow. Nadja. What are you doing here? Sh. Let me help you. Let's go. This is unreal. [SPEAKING RUSSIAN] That's Mitch. Mitch! Mitch! Savoy. Savoy, don't be a fool. Wait. Savoy, stop. [SPEAKING RUSSIAN] Mitch. Mitch. Mitch, we're going home. Mitch, he'll kill you. [SPEAKING RUSSIAN] Check mate. What have they done to, Mitch? Mitch, listen to me, we're going home. Mitch. [SPEAKING RUSSIAN] We're never going to make it. Do you have the map and the flashlight? I'll mean you at stable. What about you? I'll make it. [SHOUTING] Take the sewer. You'll never get out of here alive. Come on, Mitch. Savoy? Wait. Wait, I lost the flashlight. Mitch. Come on, Mitch. Savoy. Sh, Mitch. Be quiet. Come on, Mitch. The Admiral and Nadja are waiting for us. Hurry up. [INDISTINCT SPEECH] What have they done to you, buddy? What have they done? Mitch? Buddy. No. Mitch! Get back, Savoy. No, Mitch, we're going home. Go. Mitch. Mitch. No! Nadja? Quick. The Admiral has been shot. We're running out of time. You can drop the Admiral bullshit now. They shot Mitch. He's dead. I did-- - Watch it. I wondered when they would get around to that. Come on. Let's move out. Grab anything. ARs, bazookas. Anything. Let's go. Come on. You OK? Get down. Don't make me kill you. Run. Now is when I jump ship. What do you mean? You're not coming with us? I never said I was. But they'll kill you. I wouldn't be so sure. There are still a few scores for me to settle. Look, take the truck. Down the road about 10 miles you'll come to a river. Leave the truck there. Now, take the left fork of the river. You should be in Finland by tomorrow. What is this? It's my insurance. Tells a few secrets. It's my book about the CIA and the KGB. You get this to my friends. Their names are inside. It's my ticket back to the states. And you want me to deliver it? That's right. That's my price. I'm a dead man if I escape and the CIA finds this book in my possession. Where is home for you? Chapel Hill, North Carolina. Well, it'll be dawn soon. You two better get going. Take care of her, Savoy Brown. I will. Remember everything I told you about the KGB. You're never really out of danger. I'll cover your back because that book is my life. Don't worry. I'll see you back home. Thanks a lot. SAVOY: Come on, baby, just a little further. We're out of gas. Savoy, forget it. This doesn't matter. We're in Finland now. Somebody is coming. Maybe we can get a ride. Remember what the Admiral said about the KGB. It's all over. We did it. [MUSIC PLAYING]
