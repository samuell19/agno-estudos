Someone needs to stop Clearway Law. Public shouldn't leave reviews for lawyers. Damn. Sanya? I'm so sorry. I don't think I can make it to pick you up on time. I got a flat tire. Are you okay to wait a bit longer? Don't worry. You know me. I don't see any buildings around. I swear to God, I have no idea what to do. Go change the tire yourself. You'll find the spare somewhere in your trunk. Do you think it's that simple? Oh, boy. What's wrong, Miss? I got a flat tire. The nearest garage is miles away from here. Maybe I can help you. Can you pop the trunk? What for? I need the jack. Oh, okay. Sorry. Is it going to take a while? It could feel like a long time if you're impatient. Are you in a hurry? I'm sorry. I feel bad. Don't be. How old are you? I'm 18, miss. So you're still a teenager. Yes. I think I've brought all your order out. Thank you. You're welcome. April, how's your car? Are you good to go now? No problem. A guy offered to help. Is he gorgeous? Sanya! Ask his name then. I'm not you. I can't just flirt with any man I met on the street. But what if he was your soulmate? Really? Find your soulmate in the middle of nowhere? Whatever, get a hurry on. Just sit down, and wait until I come, okay? Sorry for asking this again. But how long will it be? I'm almost done. I need to tighten the nuts. If they're loose, you're risking losing your tire while driving the car. It could be dangerous. It makes you realize how important the tires are. It's one of the most important parts of a car which is often being ignored. People care more about the interior, the model, or the beautiful lights. Not many people talk about the quality of the tires. How perfect the grip is and everything. Exactly. Despite so, they keep a low profile and are always ready to take you wherever you want to. They take all the weight of the car. But they keep on turning. Sometimes they're at the bottom and sometimes on the top. What if they're human-like? They might not want to go to the bottom once they know how good to be on the top. And what if they decide to be square-shaped? That would be bad. Hang on. This is a little something from me. I can't thank you enough. No. I was taught not to refuse money given to me. Thank you. No, thank you. No problem. Miss. Drive safe. Okay, thanks. Miss. Call me if you have another problem with your tires. Only if there is a problem. Don't call me if you're good. Miss. Nothing. April! I missed you so much. How are you? I missed you too! Now tell me why you decided to come home and about the dramatic resignation. Working on TV was exhausting. I had no time for anything else and it drained my creativity. So I resigned. What do you have in mind for your future? I'm not sure. But maybe creating a YouTube channel. I think it's exciting and I won't be working for somebody. Anyways, tell me about the man you met on the street. You have to talk about the man? Unlike you, I don't flirt with every man I see. - Are you hungry? - I'm starving. Have more of this. Sure thing. This is so good, the most delicious meal I've ever had. It's been a while since we did this. When was that? Three years ago. - Oh, yeah. - That's quite a while! I think that was before I started working. It feels like it was yesterday when you got your first job and look at you now. Amen. April won't be far behind you. I've sent an application to UCL. Management Department. You'll be leaving in four months and you have to focus on your future. Because I already planned to make you the head of our branch office. By the way, have you prepared all the old books that we want to give away? Why don't you go and do it? Okay, Mom. Excuse me. Could I be excused too? I better help April pack. - Alright. - Thank you. The food was great. I don't understand. I thought you agreed to send April to college in London. I know. But I don't think this is the right time to tell her about it. I don't get it. How could they decide such an important matter without involving me in the discussion? Deciding on how to live my life? How I'm jealous of you. You don't have to worry about your future. Everything's planned for you. Do you think it is nice to not be able to make any decision yourself? Well... At least you're in a better position than I was. I was in a downward spiral that... Well... I know that was one of the hardest moments of your life. But... I'm proud of you. You're great. You've overcome your depression. And I've been thinking about what I should do to repay you. Don't even think about that! What do you have to repay me? You are welcome to stay with us for as long as you want. I can't do that to you! If not here, then do you want to go back to your own house with your mom? I don't think I can do that. You know how happy she is with her new family. Now that I have some money, I think I'm going to rent an apartment. Now I'm jealous of you. Can I have some of your money? Careful. Don't drop the box. - Can you lift the box? - I can help you carry it. It's heavy. Careful. Don't drop it. Good morning. I don't think we've met. Good morning. I'm April. I'm Mrs. Halim's daughter. So, you're Mrs. Halim's daughter. I thought you were coming this afternoon, but you're already here. Thank you for the books by the way. I hope they're useful for the children. Is this your first time here? Yes, Ma'am. What do you think about this school? Too crowded, right? But that is what I like about this place. It makes this place unique. This place used to be a house before it was converted into a school. By my favorite ex-student and his friends. What is that? Who wants snacks? - Me! - Me! Here you go. Bring this bag inside and the rest can be enjoyed here. Come and get them! Don't fight. There are enough snacks for all of you. Where did you get all of this? I got a windfall on my way here. What kind of windfall? She is the one who gave it to me. Okay. I'm going to bring this inside. You're so kind. Thank you. - Excuse me. - There's some bread. This is him, the favorite student that I was talking about. This wonderful man. What are you doing outside? Doctor said you have to stay in bed for several days and limit your activities. Oh my... It's just a cold! Also, we have a guest. I can't just leave her out here alone. Now you can go back inside and let me handle the guest. I'm afraid I'm going to have to go back inside. Dika will take you on a tour of this school. He won't take no for an answer. - Go rest. - Bye, April. Have a good rest, Ma'am. What are you doing here? I came here to drop off some books. So, you care about children's education too. Thank you for that. What are the odds of me running into you again? I think that's fate. Or maybe it's just a coincidence. A coincidence is a fate in disguise. Said the mechanic who dabbles in philosophy. Have you said thank you to this nice lady? - Thank you! - You're welcome. You went to this school, right? Yes. I spent my childhood here and Mrs. Asih was my teacher. I think I spent half of my life living here. Senandika. If you don't mind. Thank you. April. And your surname? - Just April. - "Just April". So... Your name is Senandika. That's an unusual name. If I'm not mistaken that word is often used in literature. Did you study literature in college? No. I just like literature. What do people call you? Dika. It's Sena now. There was only one other person who called me Sena. My late mother and you. Sorry, excuse me. What's up? What is it, Mbul? Okay, I'll be right there. The street is calling me to perform again. I have to go. Dammit. It won't start. I can drive you there if you want. Where do you want to go? There's something about our fate I just can't explain. It has nothing to do with fate. I'm just returning a favor. You helped me before and now I can help you in return. Shall we? Okay. Rizal. I'm leaving my scooter and my helmet here. Okay! I thought you said you're a street performer. Every musician in the world is actually a street performer. The only difference is where they perform. Senandika Sukriwil. And who's the lovely lady? April, meet Giras. - Hello. - Hi. Giras is the owner/barista of this cafe. - He's my boss. - Right. It's more likely "a tortured boss". He's tougher than me. Pick any table you like and I'll send you cups of coffee that matches your mood. Now, what do you have in mind? I don't drink coffee, actually. But after you taste my brew, I guarantee you will become a coffee lover. This is the perfect coffee for someone who's wondering about something. And this is for you. It's a decaf. I know your heart is racing right now. I'd better go back to my station. I think I've overstayed my welcome. He's not wrong. My heart is racing right now. Maybe I'm nervous that you're going to watch my performance. Wait. There's a proper way to sip your coffee. Really? How? Inhale the aroma from the steam. Pick your cup up slowly. Bring it to your lips. Press it between your lips. Sip it slowly. Don't swallow it yet, taste the coffee in your mouth and then swallow. Well? It's good. A bit bitter, but enjoyable. Actually, you'll get the same taste using any method. I don't think what I told you will make a difference to the taste of your coffee. It's coffee. What do you expect? I dare you to drink it like you drink any liquid. I bet it would taste the same. Welcome to my mini studio, also my bedroom. So, this is where you write your songs? Yes. I record my song, writing, and composing my music in this room. I get my inspiration in this room. Is that you and Giras in that picture? Don't look at the board. It's embarrassing. Do you realize rather than employer and employee, you guys look so close, you both behave more like brothers. - Brothers? - Yes. But I hope you don't find me looking like him. He does help me a lot. I think your songs are great. Have you ever tried sending them to record labels? I did. But, well... That's not what the universe wants for my life. Does that mean that none of them offered you a contract yet? Don't give up. When you did something to reach your dream, well, without you realizing it, your dream is reaching out to you too. That's how the universe works. Right? Yeah, yeah. I think the universe is backing me up right now. I can feel my dream reaching out to me. It's so tiring to lift all the chairs up onto the tables all alone. Your guest is still here. Since I thought I was alone, I wanted to close the shop. Alright... It's late. I should go home. What time is it? Time flies. People say if you spend time with the right person, time would fly so fast. Sounds weird. Anyway... Forget about that. Come on, I'll walk you out. HI, HOW ARE YOU? YOU WERE WITH ME A FEW MINUTES AGO, AND NOW YOU'RE ASKING HOW I AM? JUST MAKING SURE IF YOUR HEART'S OKAY GIRAS SAID HE GAVE ME DECAF BUT MY HEART IS STILL BEATING SO FAST WHY DON'T YOU GO SEE A DOCTOR? MAYBE THERE REALLY IS SOMETHING WRONG WITH YOUR HEART DOCTOR CAN'T HEAL ME WHY? BECAUSE MY HEART WILL BE BEATING FAST EVERY TIME I MEET YOU WHY ARE YOU SO SURE WE'LL BE MEETING AGAIN? BECAUSE I WANT OUR FATE TO BE SO After that casual introduction and meeting, I'm hoping that everything will proceed normally. But... Unfortunately, your simple "Hi, how are you?", have melted my heart. Sanya! April! Why didn't you tell me you were coming? Sanya. You will never change. What are you doing here? Hold that thought. Let me guess. You're going to tell me a story about the prince you met on the street, right? You're so dramatic. I never called him a prince. But somehow it makes you nervous. His name is Senandika. I liked his performance. Just his performance? I'm serious. Maybe you can do a collab with him. What kind? Any kind of collab. Or if you don't want to collab with him, maybe you can give him some tips how to get more people to listen to his songs. He has a great voice and great songs too. It's a shame if nobody knows about him. Are you falling in love with him? I don't know. But you keep checking your phone. That must be him. OKAY, I'LL BE THERE I want to see his picture. I don't have any. What do you think about Senandika? He's a very cheerful person. He keeps everybody here very happy. Especially me. But sometimes, he can be a bit stubborn. Really? He didn't finish college and used the money to fund this school. Of course I refused the money, but he kept insisting. Now I'm jealous of Dika's life. I wish I was in his shoes. Each person has a unique life that only they can experience. That's what he said. You understand him so well. He's lucky to have you. No, I'm lucky to have him and the other kids. I'm lucky to have you because I think of you as my own daughter. Thank you. You're hugging and talking just like mother and daughter. And don't remember going home. It's late. Time to go home. Good night, Mrs. Asih. - Say hi to Giras. - Will do. - Bye, Mrs. Asih. - Take care. - Good night. - Thanks. Are we still on for tomorrow's meeting with my friend? Yeah. - At the cafe, right? - Yeah. What do you think? I like the song. And his voice is nice too. It has a strong character. And I think, the music and the lyrics are easy on the ear. Thank you. By the way, your full name is Senandika. What do you want people to call you? - Sena. - Dika. Just call me Dika. Okay then, the next step is to promote your music on social media and expose the song to as many people as you can. Because I think this song is going to be a hit. Amen to that! So from now on, Sanya will be your producer. She's an expert too. She was a producer on TV. Can you excuse us a moment? We'll be right back. I thought this meeting was just about me giving him advice. And now suddenly I'm his producer? Well, I thought it was an opportunity for you too. To launch a talented new singer. Well, it's a win-win solution. Both of you can work together and create a YouTube channel. What do you think? Okay. Deal. I'm going to help you become popular. Are you serious? I mean, if I need to improve the song, or you don't like the music or the lyrics, I can make some adjustments. They're perfect. Right? Thank you. You play the piano well. When I was a kid, I took a lot of lessons. I took music lessons, painting lessons, and ballet too. And self-defense, even. That many, huh? Your parents really paved the path for you. Not really... I can't even choose my own college. My parents picked the major that they wanted me to take. Well, actually... I composed a song. But it still has no lyrics. Play it. I want to hear it. - Are you sure? - Yeah. Who knows, maybe I can help you with the lyrics. - Okay. - Come on, let me hear it. That's it? Let me try. Right? It's good. I like the song. Can I write the lyrics? - Sure. - Okay. I like your house. Meet my parents. Mom, Dad. This is my friend. Friends... We met on the street. We met on the street, and he helped me change a flat tire. Yes, but I'm not a mechanic. Where do you go to college? College? I... I went to college for a while, but I dropped out. - He's a musician. - Really? Where do you play? In a cafe. I've never seen your face on TV. Anyways, he has to leave. He has to perform for tonight's live music at the cafe. Right. It will be great if you could come to the cafe if you have time. - The food there is superb. - Let's go. If you want, I can bring you the food. Free of charge. It's a pleasure to meet you. You're funny. Thank you, Ma'am. I'd better leave now. Okay. Agus, can you help him push the scooter? It's okay, I'm good. - Wait a minute. - Thank you. - Are you sure? - I'm fine. Just a bit nervous after meeting your parents. See you. Bye. - Take care. - Okay, bye. April. Yes, Dad. You just met him. You don't know anything about him. Why did you invite him here? But he's a good man. I know it. Being good is not good enough. He has to be worthy. What do you mean by "worthy"? Worthy of your social class. We have to know his family, his education, his intellectual ability, and more. But for me, a person's worth is valued by his eagerness and ability to earn it. We can't see it now, only in the future. Let her go. She needs to be alone right now. You can talk to her again later. What's wrong with you? Aren't you concerned about her future? Tell Agus to watch her around the clock tomorrow. I don't want her to see that man again. I never knew you liked drinking coffee. You learned that from your friend, huh? After you met on the street, he took you to a cafe? It was not like that. He works in a cafe owned by his friend. I know you're in love. Don't lie to me. Mom... Do you think a person who doesn't have a title behind his name is doomed to fail in his life? I think every person has their own future already written for them. How about Senandika? Miss April, can I have the car key, please? - Why? - Your father said I have to drive you around today. Fine. Take me to Sanya's apartment. Yes, Miss. Yes. Why are you so upset? What's up? This is too much. I can't go anywhere without a driver now. What did you do? Just because... Yesterday I invited Sena home and my parents came home. You can imagine what happened next. Don't worry. Let me handle that. I'm not kidding. Well... I don't think we can do it. Agus. Where are we going now? Can I borrow the car key? But I was told to... This is girls' stuff. We'll be back before you finish your cup of coffee. - But what if... - Mr. Halim won't be angry. I know April's dad. He won't be mad. Don't worry. Please? Okay? We won't be long. We'll be back before you finish your coffee, okay? - But what if... - Hush. - Let's go, April. - Right. Bye! A lyric video? Why not directly make a video clip? Here's the thing... We need to start with a lyric video to help the viewers memorize the song, so they can sing along. What do you have in mind for the video? Something that depicts sunset and serenity. But it has to represent the mood the songwriter wants to express. Sunset and serenity I have an idea. Leave the video to me. Are you sure? Absolutely. But I'm going to need your help. Okay. Careful. You've never visited this place before, right? No. Wrong answer. You've visited this place before. - What makes you say that? - You did. Because you're here, with me. But not before. But coming here today counts as a yes. What do you think? I usually come here, sit, and enjoy the view. Move a little. Right! Now sit on the ground. Yes. Okay, stay there. Now, look towards the sea. Okay. Now what? Done. The phone is recording us from that spot. It will give us an image of ourselves. Sitting here enjoying the view and the sound of the waves and the wind. That's it, let's enjoy the moment. I want you... I want you to close your eyes. Now I know. Know what? You must want to invite the viewers of the video to enjoy this moment too. Because the view is spectacular. Everybody will love it. Yes, you're correct. You're correct. That's the perk of having a conversation with an intelligent person. Just like you. I'm not kidding. Your interpretation is on point. I know that my heart is in your hands now. You can either take good care of it or break it. You flew back to the sky and I landed back on earth. Back to my boring life. Dear God. See, girls' stuff didn't take long. Did you get enough sleep? You can drive her home now. Thank you. - Good night. - Bye, Sis. Stop, Sir! Where have you been? Why didn't you answer my call? I'm sorry. I understand if you want to fire me. What are you talking about? Miss April and Miss Sanya left me in the parking garage. I don't know where they went. How did that happen? It's all my fault, Sir. I'm so sorry. So, April went with Sanya? Yes, Sir. Then, you don't have to drive April tomorrow. Just follow her around. - Yes, Sir. - And don't get caught. - No, Sir. - Okay? Sir. Yes, Sir. Park the car. I know your video is going to be a hit. Amen. The night greeted me Right when I thought I was alone It helped me to understand I may have a different way When I judge Everything that has happened in my life I speak from the heart Reflected upon it Silent, I'm keeping my silence And staying silent Allowing a conversation Between me and myself Instead of with her or them Silent, I'm keeping my silence And staying silent Allowing a conversation Between me and myself Instead of with her or them Looking within myself Thank you. Awesome! My man Kriwil! What did I tell you? You just need to focus to be successful. Amen. Thanks to these beautiful people. All I can do is thank the universe for bringing us together. You, being famous, has brought people to my cafe too. Look at this. Is this the video you uploaded that day? A million views! Can you believe it? In just a week. And it qualified the requirements for trending music videos on YouTube. - Really? - And not only that. Do you know what's crazier than that? A record label is asking for a demo tape. Congrats! Thank you, April. Right... Mrs. Asih will be thrilled to hear the news. We have to tell her. - Who is she? - We'll introduce you to her. Don't worry. Ready, kids? Do you know what fish this is? It's a piranha! - How about this fish? - It's a dolphin. Snacks! Who wants snacks? - Me! - Me! Hang on. No need to fight. Go back to your desks and sit quietly. Sit down. Who can pass the snacks around to everyone? We have enough for everybody. Don't fight. You're so beautiful today. You called me this morning. Telling me about throwing a party in the school. So I'm just trying to look my best. You don't want people to see me looking ugly, do you? You never look ugly! You're always beautiful. Oh, stop it, you. Then... How about April? She's super beautiful. Always and forever. To him. Finish it. Let's learn. Look for the blank ones. Color it. Write it down. I never thought it would be this fast. That's called fate. Now you're lecturing me about fate. Then what do you call it? Divine intervention makes a way for us. But I'm not kidding, I'm so grateful to have met you. I hope it will continue as smoothly as this. I hope God would let us stay together when our path comes to an intersection. I don't think I'm ready for that. And my ego is telling me to make our relationship official so we can stay together. So... Make it official, then. April. Come here. Sit down. Sit down. What is this? Where did you learn to be like this? You're embarrassing your family. Where are you going? April! You are not allowed to go anywhere until you leave for London. Why are you doing this to me? You should be grateful. I've planned only the best for your future. What should I be grateful for? For not being able to make decisions myself? See? Is this what you've learned from that mongrel? Dad! Senandika is going to have a bright future. - He's going to... - Enough. I'm going to make sure your visa gets approved earlier. You went too far. Why don't you just do what your father is telling you? It's for your own good. My own good? Did you ever once ask me what I think is good for me? The answer is never. Dad! No, it can't be. Dad! You can't do this to me! Agus! Agus, unlock the door! Sena... I can't take it anymore. I know, but we can still meet at the airport right before you leave. I can still meet you. Please, don't... April? April? April? April? - Sena? - Hey... How did you get here? Don't worry about it. But I'm worried about you. What's going on? Hey... I don't want to go to London. Thinking of us being apart scares me to death. For now, you should do what your parents want you to do. I don't want you to become a rebel just because of our relationship. Then how about us? I thought you told me you want us to stay together when the time comes to choose our paths. It's just a matter of time and space. As long as we still love each other, nothing can break us apart. It will just take a longer time, okay? I don't want you to regret it for the rest of your life. This is the perfect time for us to prove to your parents that we belong together. You excel in your education and I in my career. While being there, I want you I want you to write everything you feel in that book. I want your every story, every poem. And when we finally meet again, you would have filled all the pages. Please wait for me. Absolutely. I will definitely wait for you. Come in. Well, come on. Don't be shy. What do you think? Go look around your new apartment. This is awesome. I know, right? - Amazing. - Look. I have a surprise for you. This is You don't think this is too much? I mean, between the guitar and the apartment. Don't you feel we're spending too much? Nonsense. I've calculated everything. And if you want to be famous, you can't live forever in Giras' basement. That would be embarrassing for me as your producer. Thanks. No problem. I just want my artist to live in a nice space and create more beautiful songs. - I hope so. - And if you need anything, just tell me. Well then... I just need to unpack and take a nap. Okay. And you're having dinner with me at my place. I already ordered food. By the way, my apartment is next door. Okay. Bye! Bye. Come in. Wow. Come in and let's eat. You look like you're well prepared. By the way, some company is offering you an opening gig at a festival. Not big, but the money is good. Festival? Sure. Why not? So you're in? Great. I'll let them know. Oh, right. How's your relationship with April? Our relationship? Well, we're fine. I can't believe you let her go that easily. I mean, a long-distance relationship is too problematic to me. No, it's not It's not about me letting her go. But if she told her parents that she refused to study abroad, they would think she is disrespecting them because of me. That's the problem. And a long-distance relationship is just a matter of space and time. - It won't affect our relationship. - I see. But don't you think it sucks? All you can do is just call each other without... Without what? - Without... - Oh, God. No. I don't know, but... Assuming I know what you're thinking, our relationship is deeper than just physical. April is so lucky to have you as a boyfriend. You can say she's lucky to have me, or the other way around. I hope it's a win-win situation. I hope so. Thanks to the lyric video uploaded on the YouTube channel, a musician named Senandika got his song popular among young people. Many people found his lyrics relatable to the feelings of romantic relationships of this generation. - It's Dika! - He is! He found success as his singles become hit after hit as if its lyrics fill with spells that charm his listeners. Besides writing his own songs, most of the music compositions were done by him too. It helps to contribute to the uniqueness of his songs. A YEAR LATER You taught me To fall in love Coming! - Dika. - Yeah? A promoter is interested to fund your concert. What do you think? - Wants to fund you. - Well... Are we talking about a big stage and everything? Just performing on small stages can sometimes overwhelm me. Especially when I'm in the middle of writing new singles and everything. We need extra time and energy to do that. One more song and you can release an album. And I think you should accept the offer. It's good for your career, you're going to be a big star. That's what I promised to April. So? So, I want you to listen to this song. - A new song? - Yes. - I want to hear it. - Alright, come here. Listen. But don't... Don't what? Don't judge the song yet. Listen with an open mind. I still can't decide on the title. I don't know if I'm going to title it "Timeline" or not. - Okay. - Listen. The memories come rushing Along with the perfume you wear In the middle of the pouring rain The laughter and the tears That we shared together Are all in the past Congrats! You finally finished your first album. You're awesome. Congrats to you too. You passed your final exam. How much longer? When can we meet again? Not long if you learn to be patient. Well, I hope you can finish your study soon and have a successful career. I can join you there. It's my dream now. Don't give up. Your dream is reaching out to you too. Bye... Guys! Everybody! I want all of us to make a toast to Senandika for his upcoming first tour to 20 cities! Applause, everyone! Cheers! - Thanks. - You're welcome. Where are you going this late? I want to see Senandika. I'm going to surprise him. Senandika? Why are you still seeing him? I thought I told you I don't like him. He has a successful career now. And I went to study abroad, just like you told me. You can't make me stay. Did you hear what your daughter said to me? She has lost her respect for us. I regret sending her to college. There's nothing we can do to change her mind. Senandika is a successful artist now. You have lowered your standards now? Why don't you tell her too that if you chose your ex-boyfriend, Pras, over me, today you would be the wife of an entry-level employee and living from paycheck to paycheck. So, you're the one who is great? That I'm just a stupid woman who hit a jackpot by marrying you? But if I didn't marry you, maybe you wouldn't be this successful. After everything I did for you, how dare you talk down to me! - Good night, man. - See ya. Thank you. Thank you, guys. That's enough. No! Senandika, let's make a toast! We did that already. Where have you been? Let's go home. No. Let's go. Everybody has left. Nope. That dude's still here. Can you walk? How many bottles did you drink? How many bottles did you drink? Dika. Come here... How many bottles did you Sanya, stop! April, wait. April, wait! I can explain. Wait! I can explain! April! Dammit! - April, please listen to me. - Let's go. April, wait... April, listen to me. I can explain. It's not what you think! Drive, now! Now! Please let me explain. April! Dika. What happened to you? April... Our journey together has come to an end. After being betrayed, it won't change our feelings for each other. The only thing that has to change is our role. Stupid! But in the end, my fingers will find the right hand to hold. My head will find the right shoulder to lean on. And my heart will find the right home to stay. Do you remember when we cared about each other? Let me do it. When distance kept us apart. You remember what you said that distance is just numbers? That our feelings are more important than numbers. If you don't mind. When we gave up everything just to stay together. When we can't tell when our eyes will meet. I should make our relationship official so we can stay together. Do you remember when we sat on the beach watching the sun go down? We were holding hands and both of us refused to let go. And you're going to tell about the color of the sky that day. And you're going to say no sunset feels right without me by your side. I was ready to lose you. The same way you were ready to leave me. When loyalty becomes expensive. When saying sorry's too difficult. Whose ego do we feed. I don't know. I was mad, it doesn't mean I don't care, I keep silent, it doesn't mean I have no concern. And I'm lost, it doesn't mean I don't want to be searched. Mrs. Asih. I didn't know you were coming. I'm glad you're home. Are you okay? You're famous now. I'm so happy for you. Your brothers and sisters too. Your songs are being played on TV. You're a star now. Are you okay? Forgive me for neglecting you. Please forgive me. It's okay. I know everything will turn out okay for you. Okay? Not everything. I just want you to be healthy again. I want to make you happy. I want to be there for you when you need me. I don't need anything else. I just want to be around the people I love. There, there. Bro. Please, I'm begging you. I really need to see her. Please. What do you want me to do? What can I do? I have to explain it to her. You're the only person I know who can arrange the meeting. If she doesn't want to see me in her house, tell her she can pick any place she wants. You want to see her in her house? Are you sure her father won't kick us out? Then let's not meet at her house. I just need to explain everything to her. Or tell her to come here, or any place at all. Come on. Senandika... April saw you with her own eyes you and Sanya on the bed. Now think. Which girl wants to be treated like that. Who would want that? But you know the truth is nothing like she thinks. I just want to tell her that. That's all. You're already in a shitty position. Unredeemable. Listen... Calm yourself down. She needs time too. Cool yourself down. Kriwil! Stop daydreaming. Someone's here to see you. Can I let her in? Alright then I'll leave you two alone. Dika. I just want to apologize for what I did yesterday. And to remind you, that today you have to do a press conference for your upcoming tour. If you came here to let me know about the tour, I already know that. You don't have to remind me again. But we have to be professional. - Don't let what... - Don't speak professionalism to me! I just don't want you to ruin your tour because of one damn night. Do you realize that you're the reason everything is falling apart? Do realize that? I know what I did was wrong. Please forgive me. If you do, you shouldn't be here. You should be with April, begging for her forgiveness and kneeling before her if you must. Do that instead. I'm thinking about doing that after this. I'm going to beg for her forgiveness. Okay. But please, just don't waste the time or disappoint the people who worked so hard for your success. Sanya, do you know what time it is? I thought we're going to have a meeting with Senandika today. I still can't contact him. But I can make sure he'll be available in a few days. By next week at the worst. Come on, Sanya. You've been giving me promises since yesterday. I don't want to hear any more excuses. As his producer, only you can manage Senandika. Just because he's famous, you can do whatever you want to me. We've all spent money for him. Okay? Yes, Zal. Oh, my God. When? Oh, God. Okay. Oh, God... There he is my favorite student. You look so pretty. You told me on the phone that you're going to throw a party in the school. I'm just trying to look my best. You don't want people to see me looking ugly. There, there... Come on. I just can't imagine how the children must be feeling after Mrs. Asih has left us all. She was a big influence on their lives. How much she loved them, how much she loved me. I have so many sweet memories about her. She made a big impact on my life. Just like you did. So, no second chance for me? Sorry, Sen... But I've decided to go back to London. Just like you said, fate is trying to teach us something. I don't believe in fate now. But this is our fate nonetheless. April. Let's go. I want to talk to you, April. What are you doing in my car? Because you didn't seem to have time to see me. Get lost. I want to talk to you. I must talk to you. - Agus! - April... April, let me explain. It's not what you think. Please forgive me, April. - Let go. - If you can't forgive me, then forgive Dika. He has lost his spirit. He no longer wants to play music. He no longer can be the person you'd be proud of. You can hate me, I'd understand if you can't forgive me. But please forgive him. You don't have to forgive me, but please forgive him. The only girl he loves is you. And I know you love him too. - Let go of my hand. - Please, April. April... Please forgive him. You don't have to forgive me. I forgive you. But you don't need to waste your breath to defend him. And stay out of my life. April. What time is your flight? I think you're packing too early. Excuse me. I made you a cup of coffee. I drink coffee too now. This is how you drink it, right? Bitter. But I like it. Bitter. Just like my life. That's life. Sometimes you're up, sometimes you're down. Just like the wheels on your car. Are you sure you want to go back to London this soon? Yes. You trust me, don't you? Come with me. I want to show you something. Hi. Dad? It's been a while since the last time I touched this guitar. This is your dad's favorite guitar. He was so cool playing it on the stage. I wasn't that bad. But I decided to stop playing music, because I knew how hard it is to live as a musician. That's the reason why I discouraged you from dating that man. I didn't want you to live that life. I did everything just to make you happy. And your mother too. I know you tried to make us happy. By obeying me. And now, I'm going to let you control your own life. Because you're an adult now. You can make your own decisions and take responsibility. Now, what do you want to sing? Sit here with me. But don't be mad because I forgot so many songs. So, what song? Excuse me, Miss Sanya. The press conference will start any minute now. - I'll be right there. - I'm going to wait inside. After considerable success with his mini-album and his first concert, Senandika will be performing in his upcoming concert tour in 20 cities which will start in Sumatra and ended in Sulawesi. I thought you wouldn't come. They've been waiting for you. So, hurry up, book your ticket, and don't miss out on the opportunity of watching his performance live during his concert tour to 20 cities. I heard rumors about a surprise from Senandika for his tour. Can you give us a few details? I can guarantee he will give his best performance for his fans. You have to wait until the tour begins to know what surprises he has for us. I bet you're dying to know. So let's ask the singer himself. Any preparations for the tour? Senandika? Sorry? What are your preparations for the tour to 20 cities? First of all, good afternoon, everybody. Good afternoon. Before I tell you what's on my mind right now, - allow me to - Turn up the volume, please. Thank you for all your support since the beginning of my career. All of my fans out there. Thank you very much. To have a concert tour, releasing single after single that has been played by so many people... Those were beyond my wildest dreams. I'm a firm believer that each step I take must hold some meaning. Hold some special meaning to me. Including the people I love the most. And I feel like I have missed the momentum, I have missed the feeling. And I have made the decision that I think is the most important decision in my life. For the reporters who've been following my career since the beginning it's not a little thing and I thank you very much for your support. But I've made up my mind. I have decided to step away from music and cancel my upcoming tour. Thank you. Dika! Wait a moment, I'll be explaining to you... Right, well... Dika! This is the birthplace of my career. From writing the songs and recording them. And I've decided this place to be my last stage. The song I'm about to sing, I haven't recorded it. It's brand new. It was written by someone very special to me. I will sing it for you. It's 2 o'clock in the morning And I'm still wide awake I want to call you so bad, But I don't know What am I going to say to you Damn, you poisoned my mind Circumstances are keeping us apart I slapped my own face To speed up the process Coming back down to earth And forgetting about it all This loneliness Is killing me slowly Reality is keeping us apart I wasn't supposed to Lose you I wasn't supposed to Hide from you Just let me go Against my heart I'm down on my knees I'm broken down Without you I will stay beside you when the cold turns your nose red. I will stay beside you in health and keep you happy. I will stay beside you in times of trouble and anger. Why do I keep seeing your face Every time I close my eyes I will stay beside you Even after you thought you've lost everything. My mind is clouded Please get out of my head I don't want to be crazy I will stay beside you when you're happy with a big grin on your face. I will stay beside you to hear you boast and seeing your head getting bigger. I wasn't supposed to Lose you I will stay beside you until our bodies grow old and weak. Until my last breath. Until my body returns to the earth, loving you will never be wrong. When the time comes, sadness will turn to laughter. Pain will become a story. Memories will be our teacher. Loneliness turn into togetherness. Never leave the path you've paved. Believe for you and me will become us. Someone needs to stop Clearway Law. Public shouldn't leave reviews for lawyers.
