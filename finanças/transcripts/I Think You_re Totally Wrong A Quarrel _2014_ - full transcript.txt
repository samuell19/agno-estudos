(glass breaking) - It's an ancient tradition going back, frankly, to Plato and Socrates and going up to Car Talk. There's a number of books and movies where two white guys bullshit, essentially. Two psyches argue, Apollonian and Dionysian, art and revel, mind and body, control and dis-control. And (coughs) I wanted someone to argue with me, someone who embodied the critique that of mine have offered that I'm sort of too interior, too self-reflexive, not engaged enough with a larger political, public world, too devoted to art, have no hobbies, am not saving the Lost Boys of Sudan. And Caleb really embodies a lot of that. He's read a lot of my work and doesn't like it. He's among the most quarrelsome people I've ever met. He imagines himself as this super down, political guy. He believes in the traditional novel. He hated Reality Hunger, various books of mine. He just has every position of every dumb reviewer, every misspoken notion of members of my family, and he just is that. And so I love the idea of this sort of existential journey in which Caleb almost too perfectly embodies every critique I've ever heard from age 10 'til now. I'm honestly kind of scared in the sense that, to me, he's a really strange guy. There's something, to me, sort of implicitly sociopathic about him. And I mean, there's part of me that feels there's a one in a 1,000 chance Caleb will kill me. I swear to God, I mean, he's just a, to me, he's an unusual guy. And there's something violent about him. I don't know if it's just emotionally violent or psychologically violent or physically violent. He's a somewhat physically imposing fellow. In some level, he scares me, and I guess I believe in this idea, you know, of placing myself in harm's way. I believe in that as part of a writing project. So here I am literally placing myself in harm's way. Halfway, or early in my career, about a third of the way through my writing life, I had written three novels, and trying to write my fourth novel, I just no longer believed in the traditional novel. All the machinery of the novel went completely dead on me, and so for the last, my goodness, 15 or 20 years, I've been quite actively involved in of sort of genre blurring non-fiction but also writing some books about how exciting such forms are. I want him to question everything about my life. I tend to (coughs), to think of him as a guy who always wanted to become an artist, but he overcommitted to life. He's a stay-at-home dad to three young girls, whereas I somewhat pathetically have always wanted to become a human being, but I overcommitted to art. And I wanted to question everything about me to see if I've made a lot of bad choices in my life. Caleb, I think, just wants to have a really good time. (trunk slams) (dog barks) (knocks at door) - Hey! - Hey, man. Ready to roll? - You bet, let me get my stuff and say goodbye to the wife. - [David] Okay, all right. - [Caleb] Goodbye, sweetie. - [Terry] Goodbye, hon. Have a good time. - Okay, thank you. Should be open. - [David] Is it open? - [Caleb] Should be. - You're bringing your golf clubs, Caleb? - Why would you think this is a golf club? - Well, it says Iron Bag. - What do you think I'm gonna do this? (David laughs) - What is it, your guitar or something? - That's what it is. - Well, it says Iron, it says Iron Bag. - That's just a coincidence. All right, you ready? - All set, let's go. Did you see that article, Caleb, in the Daily, at all? - [Caleb] They already got that out? - [David] Yeah, it came out last night online. - [Caleb] I haven't seen it. - [David] I don't know if you saw it. Just some kind of innocuous profile of me, but you were hilarious in the way that you, every other student was awfully nice in their comments toward me, and you were-- - [Caleb] What'd I say? Can you read it? - I'll see, I don't know if I have it. I have it on my phone somewhere. ("On the Mountain" by Mark Matos) ♪ I was walkin' to the mountain ♪ ♪ I was walkin' to the mountain ♪ ♪ I was walkin' to the mountain ♪ ♪ With my good friend "It wasn't that I didn't like him, "but I put up an attitude in his class "that I didn't like some of the books that he liked. "I thought that the class wasted time studying authors "and stories that did nothing for me. "And I felt like I was the only student in the class "who felt a certain way." - That's legitimate. What's wrong with that? - "We grew to," anyway it was sort of funny. It was like anyway, that was just a strong statement that, you know, the feeling was mutual that we disliked each other. Did you feel that I didn't like you in class? - I kind of felt you avoided some of my pushback sometimes. - Well, you're a very obstreperous fellow. I mean, you're very-- - I mean, you know, that was what, 25 years ago, 22 years ago? - Right. - What do you think? Did you like me? Wow, I'm gonna hang out with Caleb after class and-- - The reason that I sought you out on this project is that very quality that drove me crazy in class, namely that, you know, you're, as they say, in-your-face. You're confrontational. You're contentious, quarrelsome, and you drove me crazy in class. I think of My Dinner with Andre as our model, in the sense that two people are fighting for their philosophical lives. Maybe it's not, you know, the Cambodian refugees that you pretend to be interested in. - Right. - You argue your position. I argue my position. And, you know, frankly the reason I sought you out is that, in amazing serendipity, you so perfectly articulate and embody an awful lot of the positions that I've had to think through, through Laurie, through my sister Paula, through reviewers, that everything you say about insularity, blah, blah, blah, are things-- - I'm sure you've heard it. I think my views can be a little, I would like to think it's more challenging. - Can I bring us back to My Dinner with Andre for a second? - All right. - Which is you told me that was a weird model for you, because your dad thinks of My Dinner with Andre as two, quote, homos arguing. Like, what planet is he coming from? He thinks of that as being-- - Last night, yeah, yeah, - Two gay guys or something? - I go, "Oh." And he goes, "So what's this big art project you're doing "with your old professor?" And I said, "It's, you know, we're trying "to do an argument about life and art, "and one of our models is My Dinner with Andre." - Is that a film he would have seen? - And he goes, "All right, isn't that about two homos?" And I go, "Why would you think that?" He goes, "I just thought that's what it was about, "two guys having dinner, "talking about their homosexual relationship." (David laughs) You know, when you first broached the idea was in November of 2010, and you said, "I'd like to collaborate on a book with you. "It's gonna be an argument about life and art. "And let's have a big rumble and talk about it." So I come over to your house, and, you know, first time I've ever met your wife, and I come downstairs. And you sit down, and you say, "All right, Caleb, "what I'm looking for is a, "what I would like to have is homoerotic tension. - Well, not in the moment. I didn't want homoerotic tension in my office. - No, no, but-- - I wasn't, like, coming on to you. - You got to be pretty, but I mean, but you had to have thought, I mean, you're like thinking this out, "Caleb's coming over, "and the first thing I'm gonna say is," it just didn't occur to you that I might misinterpret it. - I guess I'm comfortable. - You just didn't, it just didn't, you just, I guarantee you if I brought anyone over, like of my basketball playing crowd and said, "Listen, I'd like to do a project with you." And I invite them over, and I say, "Okay, what I'm looking for is homoerotic attention." They'd probably punch me. - Not attention, that's a fascinating - Did I say attention? - Yeah. (Caleb laughs) - Dude, you got to get it together. - Okay, homoerotic, no, you're just hearing attention. - Homoerotic, no. - Homoerotica - [Both] Tension. - Yeah, okay, you got to get your syllables there, but any case. - And so ever since then, I've told my wife about, you know, I told my wife not-- - You told her that I-- - Not about, well, I did not tell her. She does not know about the homoerotic attention, and I'll tell you why she doesn't. - You're back to homoerotic attention. Caleb, it's homoerotic tension. - I'm saying tension, homoerotic tension. - Okay, well, anyway. - I'm doing this, and she's like, "Okay, you're planning "for date weekend with David Shields. "What are you gonna do? "You're gonna go out there, and then he's gonna say--" - Date? She calls this a date? - Date, she calls this date weekend. We're going out for this date weekend. - Why, I mean, first of all, just to clarify-- - "What would you do if he made a move on you?" And he said, "I guarantee you'll get published, "and then he makes a move on you." - Well, first of all, I can't guarantee you'll get published, and I can guarantee I won't make a move on you, 'cause so far as I know, I mean, every human being is on some level-- - So it didn't occur to you? - To what? That I was coming, I mean, no. I mean, I am fairly comfortable with my sexuality. I have no qualms with anyone's sexuality. I happen to be 100% straight so far as I know. And so for me the homoerotic tension, not attention, was meant as, you know, basically two guys going off for four days. For a cabin, it sounds you know, sort of weird. - Start spooning? - And so basically, the point was I thought that we should address it in our book and then in our movies, in the sense that, you know, it shouldn't be this hidden tension, that we should just broach it, so it doesn't become this weird subtext. Why would your wife, why would your wife-- - I haven't told my wife about it, 'cause she teases me. And it kind of relates to her, but you know, she's-- - What do you mean? Is she gay or something? - She got married when she was young, no, no. - I can see if she's gay that she'd marry you, maybe. Ha, ha, ha, but why would-- - My jokes are bad, at least my, you know-- - Why would gay be a big button for her? - Now it's time for me to talk here. - Okay, I'll shut up. - She got married at the end of college to her boyfriend. He was in shape, a jock, on the good career track. They got married for about a year. Things started acting odd. They got divorced, and then she started hearing rumors that he was gay, and she confronted him. And he said he was gay, and he apologized. - Did he know he was gay going into the marriage? Or he was trying to convert himself? - I think he discovered it. I mean, he said that he never did anything. He had no gay experiences when he was with my wife. - Very dubious, very dubious. - She doesn't know how to process that. But she just basically suppresses it. It's over, she got through it. She doesn't want to think about it ever again. - I see. - But she's always asking me if I have gay fantasies. And, you know, "Would you do that guy?" - Whoa. - And, you know, her ex-husband's name is Mark. Her ex-husband's name is Mark. And I always say, "What, you trying to Mark me?" She tells me about this big date weekend with David Shields, and what would you do if David hit on you. And I said, "What, you trying to Mark me?" (David laughs) - That's a great line. Can she laugh at that? - Well, you know, I love her. She's very, you know, but to her, it's a very serious thing that I don't know how much I want the world to know about this, you know. It's personal. - It's fascinating. - It's her pain. I don't know how comfortable I feel about mining other people's pain and bringing it in. ("Rocket Man" by Mark Matos) - [David] Man, it's foggy. - [Caleb] Are we gonna need chains? - [David And Caleb] Do we have chains? ♪ Wish I was a walkin' man, no talkin' man, a rocket man ♪ - [Caleb] All right. - [David] We're really entering snow country here. (Caleb grunts) The rain's turning into snow. - [Construction Worker] Two-wheel drive vehicle, right? - Two-Wheel or four-wheel? Four-wheel. - [Construction Worker] Four-wheel, you got chains? - We got chains, yes. - Yeah? - Yes. - [Construction Worker] You do? - [Caleb] We do. - [Construction Worker] All right, you're free to go, sir. - Do we need to put 'em on? - When the snow comes. You can't put 'em on without snow. - [David] Oh, I see. We'll put 'em on when the snow comes, I guess. ♪ I wish I was a growin' man, a knowin' man ♪ ♪ I would show it, man - It is interesting how each of us had a trauma of sorts that happened in high school. I certainly wouldn't compare. - No, your trauma's-- - Well, just the height, you know, I had this really bad broken leg. And there was a fear I'd be crippled. And I had this horrible broken leg. I was playing a game of football on the beach. They tackled me. I landed in this huge, kind of gully, or whatever you want to call it, in the sand. And I had an unbelievable broken leg. My left foot was tickling my right ear, you know. I looked like a pretzel. And I remember 200 people surrounded me on the beach, and they all just said, you know, that boy will never walk. He's a quadriplegic or whatever. It was quite horrific. You know, that was a big flip for me, where I went from playing sports to playing chess to being the editor of my high school paper to wanting to write, and you know, there's all kinds of formative events of my life, but at least in the family mythology, this broken leg turned me from kind of athletic doofus to someone who was more interior. I don't think that's exactly true. - [Caleb] My accident had a similar effect. - Did it? Do you feel like that? - [Caleb] I think that's the root of me becoming an artist. - Whoa, that's a little fancy. What, you suddenly became Picasso, 'cause you were in a car accident? I mean, how do you mean becoming an artist? - My senior year was miserable. It was probably the low-point of my life. There I was, you know, kind of just starting getting into like drinking and, you know, going to these parties with my friends and all that, but I was just driving home, and I always sped, and I just didn't wear my seat belt and ran into a tree. - [David] Whoa. - Put me in a coma for four days and in the hospital for two months. And they let me out and let me whatever, and as soon as I go out, I just started acting very odd. Well, I wanted to go to the high school dance. And my mom was gonna take us to the dance. I'd been out of the hospital couple of days, and I was kind of like getting back together with friends and all that. And she just said, "You're not right." So she drops them off, and I'm like really angry at my mom and said, "I want to go to the dance!" And moped in the car while she's driving. But finally, she gets me home and calls, she probably called 911. And a police officer came and said, "Listen, "we're gonna take you back to the hospital "for an examination. "If you're fine, we can come back home." And my mom signed me in as a voluntary patient. So I had my little One Flew Over the Cuckoos Nest moment. And I just had, you know, I mean they had to medicate me and kind of keep me in a room. - I guess, I'm just trying to think of how did it, you mean, this was your first experience of suffering? - You know, you just don't think about death as a kid. I mean, I think artists think about death. So I, you know, started thinking about, you know, religious questions, getting more interested in writing. I've become much more insular, and, you know, taking long walks just so I could think and started even dabbling with poetry. And, you know, it probably took about three years before I actually said I'm going to become a writer, but you know, I wasn't even close. I mean, some people start, you know, having a literary mindset when their 12, 13, 14 or even earlier. But I realized at my age, I'm beginning to feel this big weight of having not achieved one of my first passions, which was writing. - Well, there you go. - Now I'm like kind of starting over. - Interesting. - And, yeah. - Well, this is your golden opportunity. We got to kill this, right. I mean, you want to do maybe bigger things than our little, humble trip. Here's our chance to-- - Yeah, definitely. - Reanimate both your art and my life. Boy, it's chilly. (David grunts) (keys jingle) Oh, good, I had nightmares of no opening. Brr. - [Caleb] Okay, what do you think, pretty nice, pretty nice? - You've stayed here before, haven't you? - We're home. - Caleb? - Yeah, yeah, I've done some work on it. - Uh huh, yeah. - Helped build the deck and did some roofing. - Pretty nice. (lighter clicks) I'm the world's worst fire starter, so be warned. I'll do my damnedest. I can't tell you how proud I am of this fire. It's the first fire I've ever started. - I'm impressed. I kind of thought you'd burn the house down, but it looks like it will work. - [David] It's not a bad start. - It is, I mean, it's paper underneath wood. I mean, after that, it's kinda-- - [David] I know, but I am-- - All right, that works, that works. - [David] I'm Bertrand Russell, who couldn't even boil water, so I'm thrilled that I've got-- - How true is that? - It's literally true that Bertrand Russell figured out the planet but could not boil water. - I kind of feel that he just had other people boil water. - [David] There you go. - Play some chess? - Sure, okay. - Check. - Check, just like that. Well, I'm just sort of playing to play. We'll make sure that I don't lose in seven moves. - You can't just play to play. - You know, I've read your work over many years. I'm just gonna go here for the hell of it. You know, if I had a critique of your work, I hope this is okay, who knows? It's that, I don't know if it makes any sense for me to say, that your work sort of lacks an X factor. It seems to be full of the world, but it has no shaping metaphor. It's not making any meaning. The core of art is to make meaning. And as much as I admire your investment in the world, that when I read your work, it seems to me to stand next to the world and not make it into some kind of larger X factor, some metaphor, some meaning. You haven't driven it through your heart, through your mind. That's rather, you know, that's my point that I would want to push toward you that in all of your swallowing of the world, you have to figure out how to gather the material and remake it in your own voice and vision. - Well, I mean, you raise a point that writing should do more than just evoke the world. I mean, it should do as many things as possible. You know, if you're writing efficiently, expediently, you are doing that. Are we still waiting for you to move? - No, I actually moved to here. - Oh, you did. Oh, I'm sorry. - Yeah, Mr. Irrational, Illogical. - I'm sorry, check. - I guess it goes back a little bit to our idea about suffering and what the role of suffering is in your understanding of life. - I think it's a topic that is, you can't write enough about, just like love. - We know people suffer. We know that meth addicts tend not to, you know, have happily domestic lives. I mean, you know, got it, got it, got it. - Right. - I want you to bring your intelligence and transmute it into meaning, knowledge, art. Instead, it always stays weirdly lumpen as clay and just is like guess what, world? There are human beings out there who are suffering. Like, alert the media, no fuckin' joke. In a very admirable way, you're an incredibly conscientious human being who, you know, is afraid to take people's sorrow and use it to exploit it to opportunistically transform it into art. That takes 12 people's pain and turns it into maybe 10,000 people's revelation. I mean, that is the risk the artist has to take. At worst, he is a ruthless exploiter, an opportunistic asshole. At best, he or she is a-- - But what you said is what a very poor work of art, you could say, Nicholas Kristof's Half the Sky has already done. Are you familiar with that book? - Well, I don't think it even pretends to be a work of art. - Right, but a work of art is so esoteric, inaccessible, that no one gets that. It has the 10,000 people that have MFA's, and they're all going wow, this is, whereas Nicholas Kristof sells 800,000 copies. - A New York Times columnist, who has a built-in platform, is relatively-- - But he does the exact same thing that you're talking about, and it's not art. - Namely what? Just list-- - He's saying, "I'm not trying to create art, "because I don't want to have an audience "of a few very intellectual, elite people. "I want everyone--" - Well, I think he's playing at the water level he's at. I mean, this is the way he thinks. - I'm just saying you have a narcissistic goal of trying to communicate to 10,000 people that feel the same way about you about life. - In no way is that narcissistic. - Whereas someone who doesn't want to be an artist says, "I actually want to help society "and get people a little bit more aware of the world." And that's the difference. - Wow. - He doesn't want to be an artist. And I don't think, you know, he's not doing to sell out. He's just saying, "Hey, infibulation Africa, "I want the world to know about it." - Right, well, if that is what your actual goal is, then in a way, we have relatively little to talk about. You want your work not just to change things tomorrow. You want, I hope, your work to be read in the next generation, as a work of, on some, you got to have a goal, I think, of lasting, literary art, no? Is that a meaningless goal to you? - That's a fair evaluation. I mean, I feel like in some ways, when I was your student at first, I probably felt more like you feel now than I do now. When I wanted to create the art, and I didn't care if eight people loved it, as long as they really loved it and appreciated it for what it's worth. - And what has changed for you in that way? - I've spent eight years overseas and, you know, 10 years total, but eight years seeing some of the most miserable places in the world and reading the newspapers there and walking through Karachi, Pakistan, for example, and just knowing it exists there. Yes, you can know about it without going there. And, yeah-- - Well, maybe then you're barking up the wrong tree in the sense that you, I mean, it could be that you need to lead a deeply, politically engaged life, in which you are, you know, are working in helping to save the Lost Boys of Sudan. - But writing has that power. Not all writing is great art, but great writing can have that power. And maybe that's where I want to go. - Interesting, well-- - And I mean, I take what you say as far as it's the professorial, instructive voice of David Shields, and yet at the same time, I'm still questioning exactly what direction I want to go. - You honestly question that. That you really, that you'd be fine-- - I haven't resolved it myself. - You'd be fine standing on a soapbox as someone who helps the world? That would be-- - I wouldn't want it to be empty. - That's a good line. An empty soap box would be what? - A moral placebo. - Right. - Something where I feel better about it, and no one else does. (phone chimes) Hold on, hold on. - That's probably Peru there. - Wow, hold on. Hey, Gia, what's up? Not bad, wow, so you're, wow, you're like here, right now? Okay, you're coming tomorrow, great. No kidding. You're not gonna believe this. Hold on, yeah, I think that's cool. - Can you put her on speaker? Put her on speaker. - I'll give you a call afterwards. - Put her on speaker. - But yeah, I think it's totally cool. - Put her on speaker. - And we'll have to hook up tomorrow, all right. Hold on. You're going on speaker. That's cut. Hello. - [Gia] Hello, can you hear me now? - We can hear ya. - Hi, Gia, it's David, Caleb's friend. - [Gia] Hello, David. - Anyway, you're interrupting a conversation, and by chance, you're all of a sudden here. And so we're doing that. But yeah. - [Gia] Okay. - That's awesome that you're nearby, and we'll see you tomorrow. And you have to give us a call when you get nearby. - [Gia] All right, well, for sure. - All right, I'll give you a call later on, all right. - [Gia] All right, talk to you later, bye. - Okay, bye. I have this friend, Gia. She's a friend of a lot of the friends I hung out with in Seattle, and some of the stuff we ended up not putting in the book for a good reason. But she now lives pretty close to here. She's in-your-face. She's an artist. I mean, she's studied fine art. She's-- - [David] And she'll come up here and draw us? I'm not sure. - And you know, back in the day, she did a little side dancing to help her get started. She's the sort of a person you dismiss. She's part of the real world. - [David] Ooh, the real world. - [Caleb] I think we get her up here. Maybe she'll bring a friend. It'd be interesting to see what you would do. You live in academia, and you only hang out with other people that live in academia or that are very intellectually high-powered and elite. You don't want to bring someone in, because she's not gonna add to art. And if she doesn't add to art, you don't want to see her. - That's kind of nice, that your point is you got to start with the chaos of life, whereas in a way, I always want to start with the cathedral of art. So I think your point's interesting. The only qualifications I have are one, we have to use her name. Two, this conversation has to be in. - [Caleb] Well, hold on, hold on. - [David] Three, she's got to bring a smoking hot friend. (Caleb laughs) - And four, when she comes up-- - [Caleb] So she has to bring a smoking hot friend. - [David] And four-- - [Caleb] What if it's just her? It shouldn't matter. - [David] Well, then we can do a two-on-one action. I just don't want to see you naked is the only absolute, unbreakable claw. (gentle guitar music) ♪ Well, I ain't got no ♪ Big dream - Have you ever heard of this line? I forget who said it. Mediocrity knows nothing higher than itself. Talent instantly recognizes genius. - You're right. I mean, to me, it's a somewhat overloaded term. This person's a genius. That person is a genius. To me, it's an-- - Have you ever told someone you're a genius, or felt-- - No, that would be ridiculous. - The diva genius syndrome? - No, I mean, I think that would be absurd. - Nothing would make you happier than getting a MacArthur. - I mean, of course, every writer, who has published a book, has such delusions of grandeur. You know, I'm always interested in how much talent does one have? And it's an interesting question to me. What makes a great athlete, like say Michael Jordan, or, you know, Bobby Orr, or someone who's just otherworldly? And you know, you hope you have some real talent. I have certain minor gifts, which I've tried to push as hard as I possibly can, but to me, this is a story I've probably told before, so shoot me if you've heard it. It probably appears in a book or two. I heard a guide at the National Gallery showing people some paintings of Mark Rothko, asking people what's so great about, do you know this story? I've used it too many times. - I'm gonna let you say the whole thing, but (groans). - But anyway, people say what makes Rothko so great? The paintings are beautiful. They sold for a lot of money. People have written criticism on 'em. And the answer according to him was he changed the weather. He changed the conversation for everyone after him. And it just fascinated me. What gets you to that highest level? And I guess that, for me, I want, by the time, you know, I'm 78 and, you know, dying of whatever, or I hope that at 98, I felt like I've gotten to the bottom of my talent. I've expanded it, et cetera. And so how do you get to the height of talent? What's genius? What's mediocrity? And I don't want to be mediocre. I want to try and say at the end of my life I've produced work that, you know, I hope, in my fantasy-- - [Caleb] Okay, I have a question. - You know, changed the conversation for the next generation. - I have a question. - Nothing less. - If you could choose between creating two works of art, and one is what, in your own opinion-- - I'm afraid what this question's gonna be. - You have achieved genius. You've achieved beauty. It wrenches the soul. And then you have this other work of art that's pretty mediocre, but the mediocre one would sell a lot. Would you rather have a best-selling mediocre or an unpublished, never-to-be-read work of greatness? - I would say that's an easy one. Of course, I'd take the work of extraordinary bravery and power, 'cause I would feel it on my bones. And I would feel, I don't know how you could, I thought you were gonna ask a more difficult question, which is, I'm glad you didn't, but the question would be a work of amazing grace and power and beauty and truth, or a work that somehow managed to help everyone. - Ah! - And I thought that would be the hard one. I'm not hugely handy in the kitchen, but let me know if I can do anything. - [Caleb] I'm a Nazi. It's a one-man show. - Okay, when Laurie gets-- - You like mushrooms, right? - I am a mushroom fan. When Laurie gets really drunk, she'll say you only married me to take care of you. That's sort of her brutal drunk line. So I'm none too handy, but let me know if I can do anything. - She's taking care of you? Is that really how it works? - Not exactly. - I mean, don't you make more money than her? - Well, that's her sort of drunken critique if she's (coughs) a little lit. She'll take me back to (coughs), to us meeting at Ragdale, and me being sort of swooning over her many abilities as a, you know, she's a great cook. She's a great electrician. - Yeah, that's how I look at my wife. I mean, you know, she's very practical. - Uh huh, I'm not trying to rub it in, but do you bring in any income, a little, a tiny bit from writing. - You know, I did a lot of construction. But I've never made more than 20,0000-22,000 a year. That's the most I've made in any one year of my entire life. That was in construction. - And ever since the kids are born, you're pretty much, that's been your job, is raising-- - Yeah, I've done a few blue-collar jobs, but you know, to get someone to look after the kids and all that, I end up making less than 10 bucks an hour. I'm honored, I get to be with the kids every day. I get to be their best friend, and that's awesome. - I mean, in some way, you must have a relatively secure ego to do that. I'm not sure. - I get comment like her-- - Do you get the Mr. Mom comments sort of thing? - Yeah, I get Mr. Mom comments. - How do you process this? - I'm playing basketball, and like, I'm the housewife, or I'm a stay-at-home dad, which yeah, I do laundry. I make coffee for my wife in the morning. I've gotten to be a much better cook. - Seems like you're auditioning for the Oprah Winfrey Show hailed as Dad of the Year. I mean, you sound like you're honored to be with your children. Don't you ever crave writing time, reading time, cerebral time? You're a thinking human being. - I've got like late at night, or if I wake up, you know, like, four or 5 a.m. Those are my moments. And I've got to carve out the time when I can, but yeah. - You really sneak it in. How is she about you writing about stuff about her? Well, I guess we talked about this project, but what rules exist in your family? For instance, there's stuff that I want to get into this movie about some friends of yours that we've been arguing about off-screen. I want to get that in. - I'll betray myself, but not, you know, there's some things that can't go in. - On the one hand, you're saying, "Oh David, "but you never live." I go, "Okay, Caleb, you supposedly lived. "Let's bring this in." And then I want to bring in these people who are supposedly, according to you, these strippers and drug dealers, and you're saying, "Oh no, God forbid." - I never said that! - That we can't bring them in. - I'm saying this is a fictional device we can bring in, but it's fictional. - Well, wait a minute, I mean, this is a non-fictional documentary. Suddenly, you're telling me this person who gave you a call. - I can tell you a lie, but that'd be part of the, but it'd still be non-fiction. - But this person that called you the other day, that wasn't fictional. - She's a real person, yeah. She's totally cool. She's a sweet girl. - You're telling me that she's-- - She's a single mother. - You're telling me she's this sort of exotic dancer, which is code for stripper. Which one is she? - I don't have any verification of that. - I don't know if you're just concentrating on the mushrooms, but do you have any thoughts on all this? - I'm distracted. I really can't think, you know. - Right, well, I'll try to-- - I mean, after what we talked about earlier, I mean, I was serious. It can't be in. - The whole stripping stuff. - No, no, no, you can't even say it. You can't even say it. Anything about it, can't be in, period. I mean, it's that important to me. I mean, I got to get promises. I got to get written promises. It can't be in. - Right. - If it's in, I mean, I'm not gonna, I don't know. I'd rather have no movie. - Whoa. - It's that important. - Well, I mean, I think you're-- - I mean, I've had long discussions. It can't be in. I mean, we can, we can-- - What can't be in? - Exactly. - No, no, what? - You know what I'm talking about, but we can't talk about it. What I don't want to be in, can't be in. And there's no movie. If it's in, no movie. I'm talking lawsuit. - You'll pull the plug. You mean, if I name names-- - Yeah. - If I name names, the movie's over. You would pull the plug. - If I tell you what they did, which I told you in confidence, and you've already told me that it's not in. It's not in. There's no way it's in. - Okay. Well, I've, you know, I've skirted around. - I'm gonna need guarantees that it's not in, 'cause that's such a big secret to them, it can't be in. - Well, even our discussion? - Our discussion about, right now, this can be in, 'cause no one knows what we're talking about. - Right. - But it has to remain that way. - Well, I feel like it's a bit of a dry hustle, where we're promising strippers and drug deals, and we're gonna deliver long dissertations on Reality Hunger, but um-- - See, even mentioning that, you know, you just, you know. - But, well, let's bring in Franco. I don't know if Franco will come in here and promise you anything. Do you want him to come on screen? And you want him to agree to that, or not? - I don't know. Does he think that would be a good idea? - [James] If I could jump on? - Okay. - [James] I'm just gonna say, I'm gonna throw this out. And we don't have to have this argument right now, but this is all good, so don't stop. All I'm gonna say, and I hope, David, you just take on my argument. I didn't bring in Gia. I didn't bring in this mysterious person on the phone. You're bringing her in, but you're making this-- - I wanted just to be a friend. - [James] These rules about how we can bring her in. So this is our movie, we all decided on. You decided to bring this person in, and now you're saying how we can talk about it and getting upset about it. So that's a little weird to me, and it's something that's very, I think, vital to what you guys are discussing and all of that. So you can bring me in, or you guys can, I think David can take my argument and run with it. - If you're not willing to place yourself into discomfort, you're almost by definition not creating art. And I guess, maybe for better or worse, I'm a huge devotee of, you know, uncomfortable art. Why is it such a vexed issue for you? I mean, I'm asking honestly. Why is it such a vexed issue, to mention that a couple people that you know-- - 'Cause I promised them I wouldn't do it. - As simple as that? - Yeah, you know. (Caleb stammers) - What do you want to do, punch me or what? - I don't know, I just, I don't know. I have a soliloquy. I don't know. I've shut down, you know. - Shall we try and eat? Is it off? - [Caleb] Yeah. - I know that you're uncomfortable. Don't worry, okay. This is a safe place. We're all doing this. - [Caleb] I got ya, I got ya. - For the same reasons. - I know and part of me has this doubt that maybe you guys-- - This is what we want. We want you uncomfortable. This is what we want, you guys talking about this. This is a very great issue. And it's obviously very alive for you. So don't shut down. You can trust everybody here, okay. I'm not gonna make anybody look stupid. - I mean, there are things we have to, we can take out. I'm just trying to make it alive. If you want to talk to me or Franco before going on-- - But I mean, the thing is, the thing is, we'd already had one. Now you're like doubling down on me. - I'm just, I mean, the nothing, I don't know if we're on or rolling, but um-- - [James] I think we should just go, Caleb. - My point is that this film and the book are so aggressively about the relationship between life and art. I'm frankly more interested in our argument that necessarily having Gia show up in a G-string-- - In the book, we say there's some things that can't be in, and you say, "I agree." And I say, "I agree." And we agree, and that's it. - What would you think of when Gia comes, asking her? Would that be cool? - We can do it. - Okay, is that a deal? - We can do it. - All right. Deal? And if she says no, if she says no, then-- - I want-- - Written-- - You know, the promise, you know, yeah. - I like that. So we're building sexual tension, rule one of Film 101. - Right, if she says okay, whatever. - That seems fair. Let's eat. - All right. Are you in on that? About my sister-in-law and her friend nothing be said? (James laughs) Straight up, just say it. - I knew nothing about that woman. I did not introduce the issue. When I see something come in, that I didn't bring in, and I say okay, it was a little safe in the car on the way up here. Oh, here's something that's alive, and it has very much, it's an issue that I'm also very concerned with. - [David] What, the phone call, James? You mean, when Gia called, or what are you talking about? - What you're both two talking about, what you bring in, what you keep out. When you bring certain things in, it has an effect on your life. And do you make that sacrifice for the art, or do you say all right, I can't talk about this. Even though it will make the movie or the book or whatever a little less alive, I can't talk about it, because it'll have an effect on my life or on somebody else in my life or how people see me. That's a very interesting issue to me. And so that's what I think we're talking about in a very alive way. - It is. - [James] It's not feelings involved. - It's not theoretical. - I just don't want to stop the discussion. Relax, guys. - Beer time, huh, I like it. The beer at 10, you may need to-- - [James] Just keep this camera rolling. - I'm sorry. - [Crew Member] We got to fix it. That needs to be on. - [James] Be quiet over there. - I like for once it's not theoretical. Like, it is definitely, there's skin in the game, as they say. You know, like a lot of the stuff I theorize about in Reality Hunger, Enough About You, How Literature Saved My Life. I feel like Caleb is almost literally trying to save his life, and I'm trying to save our art. (gentle guitar music) - [Caleb] You got to admit. It's a little brisk, a little chilly, but this is pretty gorgeous, huh? - [David] It's beautiful. I pretend not to love nature, but it's hard not to be-- - [Caleb] I kinda wondered. I thought, you know, city slicker. - [David] Stymied and stumped by this. - [Caleb] Am I gonna be able to get him out on a hike? - [David] Yeah, it's pretty gorgeous. - [Caleb] You like to hike. - [David] Yeah, I do like to hike. - [Caleb] I thought with your gimpy back, you'd be stuck in your-- - [David] I know. - [Caleb] Your dungeon writing your whole life. - [David] I'm like this pathetic old man who has to watch his every step. But I definitely love hiking, 'cause I've got this really weird back back. - [Caleb] All right. This is gonna come off as kind of corny, but-- - [David] Do you have any advice in terms of walking in snow? You're a more experienced snow guy. - No, I think it's kind of common sense. It's kind of like walking, but it's a little more slippery. But you're kind of the city slicker. I'm just wondering, have you ever changed a flat tire? - [David] Well, confession time, you are quite the confessor, or I was pushing you to be a confessor during breakfast, but no, I haven't even come close to changing a flat tire in my life. - [Caleb] What a confession! - [David] Right, not too big. I don't know how to dive into a swimming-- - So you've never changed a flat tire, ever, ever? But you've gotten flat tires, so what do you do? - [David] Call Triple-A. - You call Triple-A? - [David] Yeah. What do you do? - What's that? - [David] Do you actually change a tire? - [Caleb] So you have to wait? Yeah, it saves time. - [David] Or Laurie changes the tire. - [Caleb] You have your wife change the tire? - [David] I don't know. Maybe I just am not-- - [Caleb] She's just doing it, and she's just looking at you going-- - [David] Way to go, David. Can you dive into a swimming pool? - Yeah, who can't? - [David] I do kind of a total belly flop. Every movie is supposed to have a twist, and I don't know if you believe me or not, but if some of the earlier twists were pushing you to (coughs) confront some of the limits of your art so far or our big argument over breakfast, I mean, I do feel (coughs) to a surprising degree, a kind of black heart over my moral failure to follow the promise that we made. I mean, I really feel horrible. I mean, I don't know if I'm performing feeling horrible, or if I genuinely feel horrible, but I feel really empty in my stomach. - [Caleb] You don't even know if you really are feeling-- - [David] Well, that we are doing a movie, and so I guess I just would say that I felt sort of seduced by the camera. I felt directed by the director. And so I was trying to get us into uncomfortable territory, and in so doing, I feel like (sniffs) I truly violated a trust. And you know, I don't know if you believe me or not, but-- - [Caleb] I think part of you definitely feels that way, and I appreciate you telling me. - In a way I feel like, Caleb, that we're just trading one set of problems for another. One, we started out arguing. First of all, we started out disliking each other as student and teacher. Then we started out with a bunch of reviews where you push back. Then a bunch of emails that we flamed each other. Then we did a argument in Skykomish where we argued a lot. Then we argued about how to edit it. Then we argued about me twisting somebody's arm at a reading, not literally but figuratively, trying to urge her into the project. Then we were a bundle of nerves before shooting this film of sorts. Now we've got a new problem of this whole (coughs) how much do we sacrifice for life and art. - I've already, ironically, I've proven myself, and even foolishly, I've played with fire by bringing people that are close to me into it, my family, my friends and myself, and you haven't dived into a pool. (David laughs) - Yeah, touché. - I mean, your life basically, you read a lot of books. Your own life is pretty boring. Okay, you have a high-pitched voice, and you get called ma'am on the telephone. - It's a tragedy. It's a an existential tragedy, I tell ya. - And there's nothing? There's nothing that you've done that I mean, I'm gonna say, I imagine-- - Unspeakable secrets? I think I am a mixture of bravery and cowardice. I think that's fair. Like, I try to be, I mean, I think blood on the page, you can't prove. I think of my work as having quite real blood on the page in how literature saved my life. I talk about suicidal feelings. I talk about how stuttering has made all emotions feel second-hand to me. I basically feel like, in many ways, a kind of walking dead man. And I try to use art both to resuscitate the walking dead man and to try to capture a contemporary condition of anomie, of a feelinglessness. I feel like if my work has bravery, it has the willingness to face feelinglessness. And that might be a rather self-glamorizing, but I feel like because of my stutter, which might seem like a minor hiccup to you, all emotions feel very third-hand to me. I see everything through-- - I think growing up, there's definitely-- - I see all emotions through glass. That's a pretty horrible confession. - All right. - I'm a chilly asshole on some level. - Yeah, you're an evil spider at times. You're very doing-it-for-yourself. Sometimes, your warmth, which I do think there's some there. There's humanity, but that's the whole point. I mean, you're doing this. I've always wanted to be a writer, but And this is where you're trying to be a human. What I think you need to realize, and I think you do is you're a literary critic. That's your art. You basically have started writing literary criticism, because you realize, first it was fiction that went. And okay, you are now appraised of the essay, but that slowly went as you realized you had less and less life to write about. And now you've become a literary critic. To me, it's a very, it's an antithesis to art. - Sure. - But basically, you're trying to champion art, and if that's what you want to be, fine. - Small potatoes. - And you're always saying that, well, you're half-brave, half-cowardly, and I don't see any heroic gestures. - It's as if gee, you're a physician who is diagnosing a terminal patient. I mean, it's not like I haven't sort of thought about all these things. It's not like this does not concern me. Why do you think I sought you out? Why do you think I-- - Again, where's your passion? Where's your danger? You're always writing about danger. - This is dangerous, what we're doing, I mean. I've never felt more uncomfortable in my life. I mean, I actually am quite nervous how this will come out. - You should be! - And I'm curious how today will play out. - You should be. - And I'm hoping how tomorrow will play out, and I'm hoping that we will have partial control of the final result. In no way, do I write criticism. I just don't. - I just think it's very ironic that a book titled Reality Hunger, and really, it's escaping reality hunger, because every time you write about art, it's your desire to get away from reality and embrace art. And you just have this desire to push reality away. - I see what you're saying. - I mean, look at this, look at this! Look, look! - Well, it's a very pretty postcard. What do you want me to do, to write a Gary Snyder poem about it? - You are writing about Jackson Pollock. - That's not the gesture I make. - 'Cause you're not seeing that. - First, can we please pronounce the guy's name Jackson Pollock. He wasn't a Pole. - Jackson Pollock! Jackson Pollock, so he, or Mark Rothko. - Yeah. - That's reality! - Where do you think Jackson Pollock's work came from? He was from the West. All of his drip paintings are a translation of the Wyoming landscape in which Pollock grew up in. He experienced this and flipped it into his drip paintings. - You don't see beauty in that? It's by far more beautiful than anything Pollock could ever come close to creating. But if you look at-- - Like, if you had to ask me, if I had to look at this the rest of my life or a Jackson Pollock painting, I would definitely choose a Jackson Pollock painting. - All right, I'm gonna risk myself, something that I didn't tell anyone, and I did it because I thought it would be good art, but it's something I don't, and perhaps I shouldn't feel embarrassed about it, but it's something that I do. I was traveling in the South Pacific, and I arrived at this, uh, in Western Samoa. And there's this gorgeous woman. And she's like a couple of inches shorter than me, really pretty face, nice figure. I'm like what! She's like, "Hey, ho, "you want me to show you. "I will show you around the island, and we can have fun." - So you meet her. - So I go back to the hotel, and I'm hanging out with all the people. I remember, there's like this German guy Bernard, and this Australian gal named Carol and this Mallory couple from New Zealand, and this Norwegian guy and his Samoan girlfriend. So we all go out together. We're dancing and having fun. And I've got this girl on my arm. - What's her name? Do you know her name yet? - Ah, man! I forgot her name. Kathleen, we'll call her Kathleen. - Okay, Kathleen, an unlikely name for a Samoan beauty. - She had a Western name. It was a weird, it was like Deborah, or it was Margaret. - I see, an American name. - It was an American name. - I got ya. - She said her real name's too difficult to pronounce. - I see, Kathleen we'll call her. - So I'm dancing with Kathleen. I'm just like whatever, and the Mallory couple, Lucky is the guy's name. He's just, "Oh, you are such a good couple. "You're so beautiful." And they're giving me drinks and everything. And I'm like wow, I mean, this is Heaven! Finally, everyone leaves, and I'm with this girl. And Kathleen takes me, and I'm like just sitting there. And she's just, "Hold on, let me do this." - Let me do what? - And she gives me a blow job underneath the table. - This is standard operating procedure. - This is the only time in a public place that something like this has happened. And I'm like, "Wow!" And, you know, okay, I was having a good time. And so it was finished, and I tried touching her. And she was, "No, no, it's okay, it's okay." So I get back, and it's the same group of six people. Everyone's like talking about what a fun time we had last night, and Noella, the Norwegian guy's girlfriend, says, "Do you know it's a man?" - Who's a man, her boyfriend? - And I'm like, "What!" No, Kathleen. - Kathleen's a man. - They all knew about it. They all knew that I was with a guy. None of them saved me or told me or anything. They just were like talking about me. And not only that, Kathleen knew that they knew. - Uh huh, how? Because she had been with that guy. - Because she had already tried, and they were like, "You're a guy, no way." - And did you have any-- - And so everybody knew, except me. - Well, see, like, no harm done. Like, in a way, that's an interesting story. You know, thanks for-- - I don't want anyone knowing that. - Well, I think they do now. I mean, as you say, it's in the book. It's in the movie. And I think, I mean, to me, the whole point is that we all go around sharing our tabloid secrets. - It's not like your little trauma of not diving in the pool. This is something that I haven't told anyone for 20 years. It would cause people to-- - Will Terry freak out? - She would, she will, I, you know, I mean, she's obviously gonna stay by my side. - It is a little funny, 'cause she did-- - If my dad reads that he, and the homophobia is on him, but he's, you know. - Right. - But to the extent of the family, I mean, I could get the, you know, I'm gonna be the guy who has this in his past. - In the book, you talk about how you also wrote another story that was about how you were invited to a birthday party by a woman whom I taught. And you ended up dancing with and going home with a guy who also appeared to be a girl. - I had a previous transsexual-- - And it's like, it's like that's interesting. And it's like that you seem to be, you know, thoroughly heterosexual, and if you happen to be gay, that's cool, too, if you're bisexual, but I mean, is that just pure coincidence to you? - It's just coincidence. - Do you think you're drawn toward, I mean-- - I genuinely thought they were women. - Were they, how many years apart were they? - Maybe three. - Three, did they look alike? - No. - In broad terms? - I was just super drunk and probably with a male slut mentality at the time. - I wonder if you were quite drunk in both occasions. - Yeah. - Was that part of it? - Yeah, yeah. No, I mean-- - I mean, I don't mean to bum you out about it. I mean, there's where I'm interested, because the moment it's one, it's like that's a salacious story. The moment it's two, sometimes human patterns are interesting. To me, what it's all about is the, I mean, this will sound rather pretentious, but it's all about the quality of the investigation. It's not the level of secrets you tell. It's the level of the investigation of the secret. So it's like I'm interested in it, but I'm really interested in the meaning you can make of it. - [James] So you're all about reality, Reality Hunger. Put reality into the work, whether it's fiction or non-fiction, bring yourself to the work. That that's your interest. That's your, you know, that's your thing. But if you don't have anything to put in that is going to disrupt a part of your life, let's say you had a little bit of material that might actually get another part of your life messed up, maybe gets you fired from your teaching job, because you put this material in the book, to me, that's the kind of material that you are always saying to me, "Well, you got "to put more of that in there. "Don't hide. "Put that in." Well, okay, I will, but it might have a very serious effect on these other areas of my life. But it's also a much easier stance to take if you don't have any material to man up or anything of equal stakes that I have or Caleb has. - Do you get that? - That's powerfully said, James. - That was pretty well done, all right. - And I would say, you know-- - Do you have anything? - [James] Would you put something in the - Would you disrupt your life? Would you disrupt your life for art? - [James] Get you fired as a professor? - That's powerfully said. Well, I guess I would say if my work-- - He agrees with the aesthetic. - If my work is so boring, why did you want to film us? - You don't apply to yourself. - If my work is so fucking boring, why-- - [James] You're still not answering my question! - Yes, I am, in the sense that-- - The answer is he has nothing. - Oh, you want to go to teaching job? If I'm so fucking boring, why was I paid $5 million to do this movie? Why was Caleb paid almost $5 million - There's nothing that would disrupt his life. - Anyway, it's a very good question. - He'd have to make up a secret. - You have, in a way, what do they call, hoist me on my own petard, or however it goes. Will I write a book that will jeopardize my marriage? We shall find out. Will I write a book that will undermine my teaching job? I don't know what that secret would be. But I think that's powerfully said, James. You marshaled the argument well. I think that my work opens up my nerve endings more than yours or Caleb's does yet. As to whether I would, you know, I don't have a multi-million dollar career at stake, so in a way my stakes are even lower. You know, I make like 120 grand teaching. I make around 50 or 60 grand a year, maybe a little more, publishing books. You know, I make a decent middle-class life. - Jeez. - Would I, what'd you say? - I said jeez. - Jeez, that's good or bad or pathetic? - It's comfortable, it's comfortable. It's upper middle-class. - Only very recent, did I even make a decent income. But I don't think the kind of work I care about is the writers I love from, you know, Petronius writing the Satyricon to Maggie Nelson writing Bluets, they aren't books that necessarily jeopardized their marriage or their profession. They expose their own nerve endings. So I guess I would say to you James, you marshal the argument powerfully, but I would say I'm not necessarily looking for career-dismantling things or relationship-dismantling things. I'm looking for icon-demolishing things. And I feel like that this film, in a way, is an attempt to dismantle. I'm hardly an icon, but I stand for little things. And I'm trying to push Caleb and me to dismantle some of my easily held positions. But thank you. I mean, I don't know if I want to be all kiss and make up, but thanks, James. That's a well-marshaled argument. (somber music) I feel like we were scrutinizing, in my own aesthetic, the limits of it, the strengths of it, the delusions of it, but I think that just to turn the tables a little bit, you know, the term I use rather glibly to describe my thoughts on your work, you know, just that it risks the idea of being sort of evil tourism or atrocity porn. - Atrocity porn to you is just, you know, the rush that people get when they hear of atrocity. And for mainstream people, it's Silence of the Lambs. Atrocity porn, to me, is more than that. It's a way to, in essence for me, to make me feel alive, and I think, to me, the greatest example is Waltz with Bashir. It's a documentary. It's animated, and it's about September 1982, the Sabra and Shatila massacres in Lebanon in a Palestinian refugee camp after the assassination of I think it was Phalangist, either military leader or politician. - By the Israelis? - No, probably by one of the Palestinian insurgencies. And so the whole thing is, Ari Folman's the director, and he's recounting being a soldier. And in essence, they allowed it. They enabled it. They even lit the camp. You know, they knew that the men might be rounded up, but they started seeing actual women and children being lined against the walls and killed. - They being who? Wait, they-- - The Israeli soldiers. One of these soldiers, he gives you this image of going into the camp, and looking at the bodies, and the voiceover, the looking at the bodies, and then he's already mentioned that he saw a girl, a baby girl, or sorry, a six-year-old, five-year-old girl with curly hair, a pretty face, on top of this pile of corpses. And so here you have this scene, and then all of a sudden, the voiceover stops. It's just kind of these scenes of the carnage in animation. And then the animation dissolves into the real footage. And it's the first real footage that's seen. You still have the wailing and the noise. Then all of a sudden, it's silent. And the last 30 seconds go on, and then the last (sobs), the last scene of the film is a baby girl with curls. And so I don't know if it's art or not, but it just really destroyed me to see that. And I can't get it out of my mind. - That's incredible. I mean, are you okay? I mean, you seem so upset by it. - And so, I mean, these X factors, I mean, maybe, it gets to the thing you were talking about. - That's extraordinary. I mean, I've never seen you so vulnerable, obviously. And I don't know what to, I mean, it is interesting that in the-- - Every time you kind of poke at me with atrocity porn, I'm thinking this. - Well, obviously, I don't mean to, you know, in any way, mock the seriousness of your engagement with that. I'm just, you know, very moved by it and somewhat shamed by it. Do you have any sense of why that film pulled such profound emotion out of you? - Perhaps being a father and having a daughter. - Right, three daughters, yeah. - It's an obvious connection. - Right. - It started where I just started gradually getting more and more interested in literature that's more concerned with this. - Concerned with what? - It's like solving a-- - Human horror? - I just think-- - Basically how would you, 'cause that's the history of the world is human horror. - It's just so obvious that we would all like to, you know, make love to each other and just sit there and dance around a campfire or whatever. - It is? - And we don't want to become terrorists. - We don't? - And have designs in killing people, but it seems like people do. And so I think about these questions when I write. - I mean, you've got to hear how problematic that sounds. I mean, that we're gonna solve human horror? - It is problematic. This moral righteousness, you know, I'm paraphrasing, but that's kind of what you're trying to accuse me of being. - Well, obviously, you punch a million buttons of mine. I punch a million buttons of yours. And as I've told you, I grew up in the PC family of all PC families, and I've been hearing this rhetoric basically And I guess I'm very invested in pushing back against it in my own little, I guess, apparently somewhat self-reflexive way, which is I do believe what I say, which is that, you know, I love great books, you know, and I love trying to understand the human soul. And there's a lot of ways of doing it. But the idea that we're, through a work of literature, we're gonna somehow solve the human condition, I mean, you've got to hear how hopelessly idealistic and naive that sounds. - We're not gonna solve it. We're just gonna move the needle a little closer to one end than the other. - It's almost like we might have different MOs. I could see widening my canvas, as again I'm trying to do. But I think you, in a strange way, the thing I'm trying to urge you to do is, weirdly, narrow your canvas to make it bigger. That is to say that you are working on this book, which again, admittedly, I've just glanced at, but I've definitely talked with you about it both-- - I think if I incorporated some of your elements into it, and it was very exquisitely done, it would probably strengthen the book. - Right. - But if I made it a book like you would write it, I think it would perhaps weaken it. I'm trying to learn. I'm trying to get something from you. - Thanks. - Don't get me wrong. - I'm trying to get something from you, obviously. (phone rings) - [Caleb] Hey, hey, so no way, no how? - [Gia] I'm sorry. - Hey, I'm so, uh, so, uh, you know, it'd be cool to see you and all that. - [Gia] Yeah, yeah, yeah, I know. It's just, yeah, I have to be back. - Gia, it sounds like you voted no. This is David, Caleb's combatant. Basically, the whole movie is us arguing between life and art, and you represent life. (Gia laughs) You can be a Madonna in a Rembrandt painting that will be viewed 200 years from now. Do you not want to be that Madonna? (Gia laughs) - [Gia] Yeah, that's a really cool way to put it, but, um-- - No, anyway, Gia, thanks for even considering it. - [Gia] All right, well, have fun shooting. - Thanks a lot. - Okay. Bye. - [Gia] All right, bye. - You know, I feel like I criticized some of your stances. You pointed out the deficiencies of my life. It really hit ground zero, sort of, when the whole question of Gia came up. Then we sort of worked out a little bit of a rapprochement when I sort of said, you know, honestly, I felt bad about pushing you as hard as I possibly could and bringing up names that I had said I wouldn't, feeling that if we had to, we could always edit them out, and I feel like that we are, frankly, waiting for the endgame. - [Caleb] Man, yeah, I'm getting an appetite here, man. - [David] You can direct me, okay. I've got to drive. This will be the comic part of our evening. I just wanna make sure I don't go over the side on that. - [Caleb] All right. Keep going. Just go straight. Slow, angle it back. - [David] Just be aware of that left side. - Angle it out. You've got it. Can you see through your side view-- - [David] I'm just aware of my left side. Let me just check my left side. - [Caleb] All right, yeah, okay. - [David] I think we're good. Thanks, Caleb. - Can you go forward? - [David] You're a friend in need. - [Caleb] The roads are pretty good, too. It didn't snow. - [David] Yeah, we should be solid. - So even though it might be chilly. Do you remember the last line in The Fall? - [David] I don't. I should, but I don't. - He, you know, his big crisis is the fact that he saw a drowning woman, and he did nothing. And his last line, and I didn't read it in English. - [David] What did you read it in, Portuguese? - Spanish. - [David] I love how you do that, your constantly reading in other languages. - And his last line is, to the effect of, "I really wish I could be there that night "and have a second chance to jump in the water "and save that girl. "Luckily, I never will." - [David] Right, 'cause it's total delusion, and he knows it. - So he's able to feel the empathy, but he doubts whether he'd actually act. - That's nice. That's Camus at his best. And I like that you like that line, 'cause what I was trying to say is that I do think sometimes you are very good empathizing with the girl in Waltz with Bashir, but when you are confronted with someone who has real pain, and again, I'm not gonna compare stuttering to some catastrophic genocide, but I do feel like when you are asked to empathize with some other individual, ordinary life, I think you're sometimes bafflingly unwilling or unable to empathize with it, but you're very good in the abstract realm. - Perhaps. - [David] And I think sometimes I'm really bad at empathizing in the abstract. It's all just sort of statistics to me, but I feel like I'm relatively decent. ♪ I wish I was a fightin' man ♪ Put up your dukes ♪ What's the matter, man - [David] So maybe I'll park a little farther-- - You've got a spot right there. - [David] Yeah. - [Caleb] You can park right next to him. - [David] And we can eat a dinner to celebrate something or other. It's been a crucible. These two days have felt like two months to me. I mean, it's been a crucible in a really interesting way. - [Caleb] Time flies, I mean, then it's over. - But I think, Caleb, one of the ironies of the thing for me is that we did this art project, and I've never felt closer to you in my life. I mean, I feel like you are-- - We've definitely got a genuine friendship. - Definitely a friend, whereas before, I think we were sort of collaborators and because of-- - We were friendly acquaintances, - Yeah, before this crucible that we went through, we went through, I thought, a really nervous moment this morning and all today, and who knows how it will work out, if we'll be pleased with the final film or the final book. People will like the book or the movie, who knows? But to me, one of the big revelations is this tremendous affection I feel for you. It's mixed with other feelings, too, I must admit, but I feel real feelings of affection for you and brotherly love that you're a good guy. You're such a bleeding heart. You're just such a big, you know, kind of tear-stained bear. - All your comments about how an artist, the most courageous artist seeks his own abyss was coming more real to me, because I was saying that if I want to create better art, I'm gonna have to, even though for whatever reason, I'm gonna have to go somewhere I didn't want to go, and I realize that maybe I don't want to go there. Maybe it is a question of fear, courage, you know, the ability to control this fear and master it. - So, let me, so you told Gia not to come. - No. (James laughs) - That was my suspicion, too. I mean, would you cop to it if you did it? I mean, your eyes are definitely-- (James laughs) Your eyes are definitely dancing. - I didn't. I'm saying this is a very intriguing idea that I could have. I'm still conflicted about, you know-- - Oh, now you want her to come? - Well, no, but I'm also conceding things that I've argued against. The artist expands outward, and you're saying the artist expands inward. - Both. - This time, this was a very psychic dissonance. - You were working it out. - I will be complicit, definitely. I mean, of all the villains, I would have to blame myself. - On the plane home, we'll still be working it out. - By being in this film, I feel like it is, at least right now, both have chosen art, just by being in the film. - What I'm saying is that, to me, you seem slightly appalled or like just mystified that Caleb would choose not to reveal untoward things about a friend, whereas I would just say, let's be honest, in your own work, in a variety of ways, you have chosen to make similar decisions at times, no? (Caleb chuckles) - Is that true? - I mean, of course! - No, I mean, if we're talking about just revealing somebody's a stripper, I've talked about way worse stuff. - But have you named names in a very direct way? That's the thing. It often has the veil of fiction. And I think that is a big thing. - Okay, I guess what I, okay, I guess so where I'm coming from-- - If you had a friend who was a stripper, and her name was Karen, you would call her Samantha. - Okay, I guess what I'm saying is if I-- - That's a huge difference. - If I was in Caleb's position, and I was calling somebody, without telling the director, to come be in the thing-- - I know what you mean. - I would assume that that person is down to be on camera, just like you two. So when I hear that, I say, "Okay, you want her in? "Then she's gonna have to open up." We didn't know, like, are we just recreating what's in the book? Are we having real discussions? Are these real interactions? What are we doing? So I think part of that maybe was the confusion there and also just what is this thing? We don't know. Who comes in, who doesn't? What comes in, what doesn't? - It is a good thing. I mean, if you ask, "Why do you care "so much about non-fiction?" Here's why. Because the moment it was fiction, it was dead. The moment it was non-fiction, our nerves jangled. (gentle guitar music) - [Caleb] You got your computer bag? - [David] All set. - [Caleb] What, do you have two computers? - No, this is my so-called C-PAP, it's for-- - [Caleb] C-Pack? - C, hyphen, P-A-P, it's for my sleep apnea. - [Caleb] C-PAP? - [David] Yeah, I forget exactly what it stands for, but it's-- - [Caleb] Does it have anything to do with that scuba diving gear you have at night? - Yeah, exactly, I stop breathing in the middle of the night without it. - You're like a Darth Vader. I probably shouldn't tell you this, but last night, I snuck into your room and took some pictures of you with it on. And I kind of posted it on Facebook. - [David] You posted pictures of me with my sleep apnea on Facebook? - [Caleb] It's funny. - [David] Of me with my mask on? - [Caleb] It was like at the end. I kind of, what the fuck? And it was funny. - [David] Was that like you acting like a total newbie and taking a picture of Franco when he was sleeping? - [Caleb] I'll bring that up later. (Caleb laughs) - [David] What was the value of taking a picture of me sleeping with my sleep apnea? Just to make me look ridiculous? - [Caleb] I don't know, just my sense of humor. - Right, I mean, it's interesting. I mean, the Oedipal rage of it is beautiful. (gentle guitar music) We came here to do our script. We got totally off-script. And we got into some moments where, you know, I was yelling at you. You were yelling at me. That we were having actual conversations, which was pretty bizarre. I mean, I thought it best we'd hit our plot points, but we actually got in, I would say, in trouble. We got in emotional trouble. Forget the fourth wall. I felt like we broke through the ninth wall. I mean, it was like things got legitimately interesting. - [Caleb] I'm kind of concentrating on the curves and all that. - Oh, I'm sorry, yeah. - [Caleb] No, go ahead, go ahead. I'm listening, I'm listening. - [David] But anyway, I'm just babbling on, but, um-- - [Caleb] Whoa! - [David] Whoa, pretty but deadly. - [David] Yeah, wow, boy. - [David] We hit a little, yeah. - [Caleb] That's a sun. - [David] That is a sunset. - [Caleb] Maybe I should put on my sunglasses here. - [David] Yes, we're movie stars now. You okay on that sun, Caleb? - [Caleb] Oh yeah, I got to do it again. Jeez, I take my glasses off. - [David] I mean, there's Franco. He pretends it's all about art, but he says safety first. - [Caleb] Yeah, even with the glasses on, I got to like-- - [David] He's not willing to die for art. That's pathetic. - [Caleb] I got no visible. - You were genuinely hurt. There was just a pallor over your face, where you felt genuinely betrayed. You were in a genuine panic. I thought, quite possibly, you'd take off the recording device and leave. And part of me was quite frankly trying to save the artistic project. Part of me was hurt, was feeling like I had betrayed you in a very specific sense of mentioning a particular person's name, which I thought was relatively harmless, 'cause I thought you could always take it out, as you can take it out of a draft of a book. But anyway, I was genuinely moved by how hurt you were. And you seemed like, to me, this sort of wounded bear, and I wanted to take the thorn out of your paw. And I was ready to, in a sense, I thought, somewhat stand up to Franco and say, "James, "I hugely respect your allegiance to "I really admire, James, how you have pushed us, "but I'm not gonna get 100% in support of you, James. "I'm heavily in support of you, "but I'm finally gonna draw a line "and say finally if Caleb needs "X out and Y out, "I feel enough of a commitment to our friendship "and the responsibilities I've made to him "that I would somewhat regretfully back Caleb. "I just don't want to betray a former student." - [Caleb] Now you're circling. You're busking. - I'm busking? I felt like I actually moved off of my spot. I came in as Joe Artist. I'm a very strict artist. I embrace life. I don't see how you have moved at all. - [Caleb] Why do we need to have this flip? Why do I need to move? - Because it's called a movie. - Why can't, like, end this and think that I'm even more right than I was before and that my aesthetic-- - Oh that's perfect! I move and you don't, game over. I'll take it. - If that's what you consider victory, but I think-- - I'm a flexible being, and you are lashed in concrete. I'll take it. - If that's how you want to interpret it, fine. - Interesting. - I'm just saying that you want me to fit into this role of this artistic device, and you sort of want to see this flip, but the idea that you flipped, and I haven't means that I win. How do you think that you win? - That's beautiful. I swear to God, that's perfect. It makes the perfect movie. - Are you serious? - That's perfect for the movie, because I moved, and you didn't. I'm not sure how that, I'm trying to figure out how that's perfect, but it is. - You're saying, "I'm gonna make you flip." And I'm gonna say "I'm gonna make you flip, but I'm not." And at the end of the movie, I don't flip. - No, but that's the flip. (Caleb laughs) It's hard to explain, but basically, it's this. I thought I was made 100% art and did not have a heart, but I find I have a heart, and I actually moved. In my loyalty to art, I actually deliver humanity. Whereas you, in your allegiance to life and refusing to move, you actually deliver a good movie, if you see what I mean. - Right. - That's a beautiful move. I don't know how conscious you are of it, but in your weird, Caleb-esque-- - I'm a lot more conscious of things than you think. - Yes, in your Caleb-esque allegiance to life, and your refusal to deliver art, you actually delivered art. That's perfect. (Caleb laughs) Cut, cue the fuckin' piano.
