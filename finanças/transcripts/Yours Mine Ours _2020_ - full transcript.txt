(alarm ringing) - [Man 1] Oh. (water running) (pee dribbling) Do you want some coffee? - No. Baby, you don't have to do that. Go back to bed. - [Man 1] Shut up, you have a big day. - [Man 2] Okay, if that's how it is. Thank you! (coffee dripping) - Okay, so I've got that client dinner tonight and then a meeting in the morning, bleh. And then my presentation is tomorrow afternoon. So barring any craziness, I should be back in time for dinner. Oh my god, late, so late. Um, can you grab my toothbrush for me, babe, please? It's in the cup, I put it next to the- - Uh-huh, I know where your toothbrush is. Thank you, okay. So what do you got going on tonight? You got any plans, or? - Yeah, you know me, party party party. No, I'm probably gonna open a bottle of wine and do some writing. - Mm-hm. - By which I, of course, mean two bottles of wine and spending a few hours staring at a blank screen until I inevitably give up and then spend the next three to four hours looking for porn. - Sounds kinda hot. - Yeah, you like that? - I do. I like that. My sad little writer baby. Jerking it on the couch. - Oh my god. - But like, actually don't get anything on the couch. - Oh stop. Hey, are you sure you don't enough time for something? - I really want all of that. - Yeah? - But I have to leave like 10 minutes ago. But rain check on everything here. I love you, okay? So, ah, don't miss me too much. - Uh-huh. - And please like don't waste all the good wine on one of your drunker writer tantrums. - Rude. But I love you too. And, ah, text me when you get to the airport, and stuff. - Yeah, of course, aw. - Love, love, love. - Don't make me. Fine, okay, bye. - All right. - Bye. - Bye. (phone dinging) (phone dinging) (phone dinging) (phone dinging) Hi. - Hi. - Oh my gosh, you're here. Ah, sorry, come in. Um, can I make you a drink? - Sure, what's that? - Uh, I attempted an old fashion. It's not very good, but it sure is boozy. - Perfect. - Ah, here. (ice rattling) - Nice place. - Ah, thanks. Yeah, it's small, but, oh, sorry, a tour. Ah, well this is it, really (chuckles). Ah, there's a bedroom there. Um, a bathroom just through there. A balcony thing, um, and a rooftop moment just up those stairs. - Well, it's very nice. Very grownup. - Yeah, well, have to do it eventually. Grow up, I mean. - Um, is one allowed to smoke up there? Would you? - Ah, yeah. Wait, no, I actually quit a while ago. - Oh. Well, I don't have to. - No, no, you, you can. - Keep me company? This is wow. - Yeah. We, we like it. - You look good, Bugs. - Oh god, oh Bugs. Hearing you say that out loud again is just like, you know no one else is allowed to call me that, ever. - You sure you don't want? - Yeah, fuck it. (Bugs coughing) Oh no. - Yeah, I should probably quit too. It's a nasty habit. - Oh, I definitely forgot how gross that is. I am absolutely gonna go brush my teeth. Ugh. - Okay. - Yeah, sorry. - All better? - Much. It's, it's really good to see you. - You too. I've missed you. - Can I just? - No, I know, I'm sorry, baby. My meeting went late and then we went out for drinks. And then I just, kinda got away from me. I know I should've texted you. I was just drunk and dumb. Really I'm sorry you worried, but everything's okay. I'm back at my hotel and I'll be home tomorrow night. And I cannot wait to cover your face in kisses. All right, I'm gonna try and get a little more sleep before I have to get up. I love you too, good night. Andrew. - How's he? Or you know what, nevermind. I, I don't need to know. - He's doing all right. - I said I didn't need to know. Are you gonna come back to bed? - You know, I should probably go. I'm heading home in the morning and I have stuff thrown all over my hotel room. - You're just gonna fuck me and run, that's that's real nice. - Stop, that's not what this was. I'm not running. I just have to get back. - And pack. Yeah, I heard you the first time. - Before I go, I gotta tell you something. - God, just knock it off with that serious face. - Andrew asked me to marry him. - Wow, um, okay. When, just now on the phone? - No, a couple of weeks ago. He asked me when we were in Paris. - That's pretty damn cliche, but to each their own. What did you say? - I said, yes. - Damn. Okay, uh. Congratulations. - Come on. - Wait, is, is that why you're here? To, to tell me this? - I'm in town for a couple days for work. I wanted to see you. But yes, I guess I wanted you to hear it from me. - Cool. Cool, cool, cool. - What do you want me to say? - Nothing. Absolutely nothing. I, I know I'm being crazy, but it's just. This just wasn't how it was supposed to happen. - Okay. What was supposed to happen, Evan? - Not this. I mean, what are we supposed to do now? - I don't know. Wish each other the best, say goodbye? - But I love you. I love you. What am I supposed to do with that? - Fuck you, Evan. - What, I, I do. Yes, I love David too- - Fuck you. You can't do this to me now. I told you how I felt a long time ago. Before Andrew, before David. And you, you made me feel like I was crazy. Like I made the whole thing up. Like I was the only one who was feeling anything. And now that I am happy with someone else, and I really am happy, Evan, you finally tell me how you feel? - You came here! - To try to get some, I don't know some, some, some fucking closure. But this, this is just- - Wait, stop. - No, it's too late. I'm sorry about tonight, I really am. I didn't mean for this to happen. But I can't keep doing this with you. I love you too, and I probably always will. But you're, you're not good for me. I'm gonna go. See ya around, Bugs. (melancholic music) - Hey, there you are. Ugh, you know, the cool thing about airports is that you get to see everybody at their absolute worst, which is fun. So, um, anyway, my presentation got pushed to this morning, so I got here early. How are you, baby? How's the writing? Babe, you okay? (melancholic music continues)
