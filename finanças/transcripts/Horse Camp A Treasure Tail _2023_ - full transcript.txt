Do we have a Paige Kelly? (people chattering) Bethany LaMarsh? Bethany LaMarsh! (gentle country music) Paige Kelly! Paige! - [Counselor] Hannah W.? Hannah W.! - [Counselor] Ruby Landry! Is there a Ruby Landry here? (people chattering) - Lily Marcus! Paige! (people chattering) Well, I certainly recognize some faces, and I see some new ones, so that's exciting. Why doesn't everyone go around, tell me your first name, and if you've been to Black River before? - I'm Lily, and this is my second year here. - And who's your favorite horse? - Bandit, I always ride Bandit. - Great, so for those of you who are new, or may have forgot from last summer, this is the general store. You can buy treats here, things you may need for the summer, and it's a great place to play board games on a rainy day. And who's next? - Hi, I'm Alexis, and I'm nine years old. - Everyone say hi, Alexis. - [Girls] Hi, Alexis. - And what are you looking forward to this summer? - The horses. - Mm, the horses, I love it. Okay, ladies. So, this is our opera house. This is where we're gonna do fun little plays, we'll sing some songs, and if it's a rainy day, this is where we're gonna hold our announcements. And you, introduce yourself please? - Well, I'm Kayla, I'm 13. This is my second year here, and I like campfires with s'mores. - Great job. Good strong voice, Kayla. Okay, so this is small animals. You guys can come in here anytime, and play with the pets, but you wanna make sure that you don't have a scheduled riding lesson. We do ask that we use gentle hands, and please do not chase the animals, okay? - Okay. - You guys can go play with them, but I do wanna hear one more introduction. - Hi, I'm Beth. - [Group] Hi, Beth. - Hi, and I think small animals is my new favorite. Oh, and first year. - Beautiful. Follow me, ladies. (gentle music) (chickens clucking) Okay, ladies. So this is the barn. We have over 80 horses here at Black River. This is where you're gonna come for your scheduled riding lessons. Miss Stacy has put together a really great program for you guys this year. I think we have another introduction. - My name's Paige, I'm 12, and I'm just happy to not be living at home this summer. - [Group] Hi, Paige. - Well, we are happy to have you here. And I think you haven't gone. - Hi, I'm Parker. - [Group] Hi, Parker. - I like the campfires, and catching fireflies at night. - Mm, that's a good one. Let's follow me, ladies, come on. Okay, now there is more to BR. Way on the other side, we have the lake, we have the campfire pit, and we also have the north field. So I'm gonna let you guys discover that all on your own, and I think we have one more final introduction. - Hi, I'm Ruby. - [Group] Hi, Ruby. - I am 13, it's my second year here, and I'm here for the horses. - The horses, I love it. And I think we're all here for the horses. I know that's what made me wanna come here, but remember that BR is so much more than that. We are building the future female leaders of tomorrow, and while you're here this summer, I want you guys to think about that, and what that means to you, okay? Now, we are here at your cabin. Let's go inside and make it a great summer. (pleasant music) - [Ruby] Run, run, run, run, run! (pleasant music continues) - Good morning. - Hi. We're excited to finally meet you, Mrs. L. - It's Ms., and LaMarsh, Ms. LaMarsh. - Oh, okay. Well, around here we normally do it like Miss, or Mrs., and then the first letter of your last name, so. - Yes, well I'm not from around here. - That's okay, that's okay. And we can be informal when we're not around the girls, and use our first names. Stacy and I are 26, so. - Ms. LaMarsh will be fine. Please be seated. So, I have read through each of your files. - I didn't know I had a file. So you're here from? - BMG Global. We're handling the business end of Black River Horse Camp now, as 30% partners for the majority of the revenue streams. However, with Mr. C unavailable this summer, I will be running camp. - As head counselor, I can do a lot of the day to day stuff. I know this ranch backwards and forwards. - Yes, that won't be necessary. I'm a highly trained executive. - You know, I've never heard of BMG before. And I've never seen you here before. - Well let's see, I hate horses, hate camping, and even as a child, I had a strong dislike for children. - Oh, so no children of your own, I take it? - I have a daughter. Anyhow, with Mr. C recovering from surgery, I felt it was my duty to come here to make sure that camp runs efficiently this summer. - Speaking of efficiently, I noticed you allowed a group of incoming girls to bunk together that are different ages. - Mm-hmm, yes I arranged them by their last names. It makes mail delivery easy. Is that a problem? - Right. No, but... - What she means is we normally don't do that, because then the girls aren't the same age in the cabin. I'm not explaining this well? - My concern is that it's gonna be difficult for them to get out of their comfort zone, and make new friends their own age. - Well, I hadn't considered that, but I did speak to one of the girls, and she seemed happy enough, so we'll stick with it. - Switching cabins would be really simple. - Your concerns make sense, but the decision has been made. Cabin arrangements will work fine. Make it a great day, ladies. (gentle music) - She could've at least gotten our opinion. I mean, asked us our thoughts. We've only been doing this since- - Forever? - Forever. Right, I mean I wanna like her, I really do. She's just- - A stubborn little know-it-all who makes things frustratingly difficult. - Yeah, that's exactly what she is. Does that remind you of anyone? - Remember that one summer that Keilah would not let me wear hoop earrings, even though I liked them? (birds chirping) (phone buzzing) - Well, hi Stacy. This is a surprise. I hope you're having a great day at camp. - Well? I met Ms. LaMarsh. - Oh, right. She's a charmer, isn't she? - So you've met her. - Oh, yeah. Let's just say, I'm a bit more into the magic of Black River Farm and Ranch. She's- - Not. - [Mr. C] Right. - You have to come back here and save us. - The doctor says the surgery went really well. I should be fully recovered in a year or so. Thanks for asking. I am still in a bit of pain, but I'm eating a lot of ice cream. - I should've asked you that first, shouldn't I? I'm sorry. - Yeah, you probably should have, Stacy. Oh, and Stacy? - Yeah? - No cellphones allowed at camp, you know that. Make it a great summer. I love those kids like I love my own daughters, but boy, they sure can be frustrating. Oh well. Book, puzzle. Now, I think it's summer with Clint Eastwood. (gentle music) - No cellphones. - I'm 26 years old, and the head riding instructor. I will do what I want. - You know I have mine in my back pocket. Just don't tell anyone. (Lisa sighs) (birds chirping) I miss this. - Me too. We waited nine months all year for this. - Who was it? - Who? - Your phone call, it seemed serious. - Mr. C. Nobody's coming to save us. We are stuck with Ms. LaMarsh. - Great. How's he recovering? - I don't know. I should've asked him that when I called him, but how does your mind go straight to empathy, and mine? I mean, he sounded okay, I guess. - Well, that's good. Did you see that Sugarcane's pregnant? I think she's gonna give birth soon. - I saw. Do you think Ms. LaMarsh knows? - I doubt it. - Whose job is it to tell her, the head riding instructor, or the camp director? - I will do it. - Thank you. (Lisa sighs) - It's so beautiful. I needed this. - I could tell. Tell me about you. It's been nine months since I've seen you, and you just seem a little different this year. Maybe down, a little bit? - I feel different. I don't know if it's the whole Ms. LaMarsh thing, but it feels like there's something missing. I don't know, but even you seem different. - I do? - I mean, in a good way. What's changed with you? - Not much. Well, I did meet a guy. - Go on. - And he helps people. Not to look good, or for a photo op, but he just truly cares about helping others. - And? - Well, first I was worried because I assumed he was poor. - There it is. - Hear me out. - Go on. - Then I decided it didn't matter, we could just be friends. So I started to help him, and I just felt this peace and satisfaction that I didn't even know was possible. But I liked him, like a lot. Obviously, I couldn't date him because of the whole poor situation. But, turns out he comes from money. - Of course he does! - Now we're really happy together. - Well, that's, yeah. I am really happy for you. - Thank you. Enough about me, though. Tell me about you. Are you seeing anyone special? - Me? - Mm-hmm. - No. No! No. I mean, there's something that feels like it's missing, but it's not that. I thought coming to BR could fix it, but now that I'm here, I mean, I love being here. But that feeling's still there. And like I said, the whole Ms. LaMarsh thing, it's not helping, but I don't know. It's like sometimes, I wake up in the middle of the night and I'm thinking, I'm 26 years old. What am I doing with my life? What if I fail? - Well, that's not gonna happen. Everyone believes in you. Mr. C believes in you, I believe in you, and I'm here to help. You know what I think? (pleasant music) We should go for a ride. - Absolutely. - How about, the river? - The river. (pleasant music continues) (pleasant music continues) (pleasant music continues) (pleasant music continues) How were your girls this morning? - Mismatched, they are all different riding levels. - Yeah, well Ms. LaMarsh isn't the kind to change her mind, so how are you and I gonna make the best out of this? - I'm just the head riding instructor. You are the camp director. - Thanks. - Come on, let's talk about it on our way to the dining hall. I bet you'll come up with something great. You always do. (birds chirping) (people cheering) - [Rebecca] Good morning, campers! - [Campers] Good morning Miss Rebecca! - We are the BR girls! ♪ We are, we are, we are, we are, we are the BR girls ♪ ♪ We can, we can, we can, we can, we can ride any horse ♪ ♪ Have fun, have fun, have fun, have fun ♪ ♪ And come along with us ♪ ♪ We're riding every day and every single horse hey ♪ - I certainly see some familiar faces, and some new ones as well. I believe that you girls are going to have the most amazing summer yet. Now you may have noticed that you are grouped not by age this year. The theme of this summer is mentorship. How can you older girls be a good mentor for the younger girls in your cabin? - And don't forget, us counselors are here for you, too. - And just as important as being a good mentor is knowing when to ask another girl for advice. We're all here to support each other. - Absolutely. What I know, for sure, is that this summer will be what you make it. So let's make it the best. Not only for you, but the other girls around you. - And now, today's announcements from Camper Victoria! (all cheering) - Hello, everyone. Today, the Robins will go to the barn while the Foxes have their riding. Then, in the afternoon, we're gonna have an all camp swim. (all cheering) Thank you, ladies. Make it a wonderful day. - All right, good job! (all applauding) (upbeat music) ♪ My mind goes to sleep whenever you are here ♪ ♪ But that's a good thing ♪ ♪ It's always filled with doubt and fear ♪ - Okay, so this year's gonna be a little bit different. Normally, I have riding groups based on experience, but this year, we have a lot of returning girls, and a lot of first-time riders. So what we're gonna do is have first-time girls come over here, you're gonna be with me. And returning girls, you're gonna go with Miss Sam. Miss Rebecca, will you take them? - Yeah. - Awesome. - Come on, girls. - All right, so the first thing we are going to learn is how to get on a horse. - Miss Stacy? - Yeah. - Can I stay with this lesson today? - Parker, it's your fourth summer at camp. You're way too advanced for this lesson. - I know, I thought I could help with the smaller kids in my cabin. Maybe you would even let me help you teach. I know I could assist the beginner's lesson if you let me try. - All right, come on. - Okay, first thing we are going to do is practice getting on the horse. You can do this, Alexis. What you are going to do is place your hands like this. Swing, put your foot in the stirrup. Not super deep, just the ball of your foot. Swing your other leg over onto the other side of the saddle. Ready, Alexis? - Yes. (Parker clucks tongue) (gentle music) - I'll go next. - All right, come on. So hop up on the mounting block. All right, climb up. Put your foot in the stirrup, swing your leg over. Awesome. Got your stirrup? - Yep. - Awesome. So grab the reins. There you go, and we're gonna shorten your stirrups. All right. Give him a little kiss and a kick, and let's go. (pleasant music) Everybody looks good, you guys feel good? Can I get a woo? - Woo! - Hey. - Hey, how'd it go today? - They are going to need a lot of work. - Really? - I think that one of them is terrified of horses. - Really? You know, I remember this world champion gymnast who came here, and her first year, she was terrified of the horses. - Really, I don't know who you're talking about. - She was so nervous the entire time, but she put on a really brave face. - Yeah, yeah. - You know, she didn't like me very much. - Well, she does now. Hey, Stacy? Is it okay if I talk to you about something? - Of course, anything. - Maybe later, okay? - Okay, I'm here whenever you need me. - Is it okay if I go ride? I need a break. - Well, you're in tennis shoes. Can you at least go put your boots on? - I'll be fine. - Okay, but one condition, stay in your saddle. No back flips or handstands, okay? - Deal. - Have fun.

(all cheering) (gentle music) (rooster crows) (gentle music continues) - Good morning. - Hello, ladies. It has come to my attention that there is a pregnant horse on site. - Yeah, I told you that. - Pardon me, Lisa? Speak up, please. - Sugarcane, she's almost due. - Oh, well yes. So I wanted to make sure that the, oh what do you call it? Mare? - Yes, yes ma'am, the mare. - Yes, that the mare is being properly cared for. I haven't seen anyone tending to her. - We've been taking care of her, making sure she's happy and healthy. - Oh, regardless, I have asked Timothy to come out. He is a highly recommended veterinarian. - Oh, thank you. And, thank you to both of you for having me here at your camp. - Welcome to Black River. We are perfectly capable of taking care of the girls and the horses, Ms. LaMarsh. I mean, none of this is new to us. - I want all of your attention on the activities for the girls, and running this camp. You may both assist Timothy when it comes to Sugarcane. That will be all. - Thank you. Lisa, hey. - Did you need something? Whatever it is, I'm sure Ms. LaMarsh would be happy to help you. You guys seem so close. - Yeah, you really think that she could find the barn? Look, I was hoping that you could show me the grounds. - Me? - Yeah, if it's not too much trouble. - I don't know the grounds. - You don't know the grounds? - I do, I mean I do. I do know the grounds, but not as well as Stacy. Stacy knows the grounds. You don't wanna ask Stacy? Stacy will help. You should ask Stacy. - Okay. All right, I'll ask Stacy. I guess I'll ask Stacy. I don't think she likes me very much. - Well, Ms. LaMarsh doesn't like anyone. - Ha, no, no she doesn't, but. (both laugh) I don't think he likes me very much, either. And that's how I feel about Lisa. - Lisa? - Lisa, I like her, but. - No, Lisa likes everyone. - Yeah, well? - You know, it might be the vet thing. - The vet thing? - Lisa's honestly not a great rider, but she's really good at veterinary medicine. The basic stuff. So she does all the injections, de-wormings, she stays up with the animals when they're sick. She loves them. - That's impressive. - And I think she's planning on delivering Sugarcane's colt. - I see. That might be a little bit advanced for her. - Well, I wouldn't count out our Lisa. - No, no I'm not, and I would love an assistant when the time comes. Now, what do you say you show me to that, what was it called again, the? - Mare. - Yes, the mare. Let me see that mare. - Okay, let's go.

I do not know the grounds any better than you do. But I think Tim likes you. - No. - It is a possibility, Lisa. - What makes you think that? - Just intuition. The way he asked about you. - He really asked about me? - Yes, really. - No, I think you're reading this all wrong. - Maybe. But the next time he comes back, and he needs an escort around camp, I'm not doing it. - You're not? - No, you are. (horse whinnies) - I am. - So the next time he comes here, you better find him and tell him, before I do. - Great. (somber music) (somber music continues) - [Kayla] Come on, y'all. I wanna show you something. (girls laughing) - Immediate flip. - Okay, I wanna show you all something. - You're not supposed to have cellphones at camp. - I know, but these are just so cute. Okay, look. This is my family at Niagara Falls. My parents and my little sister. She's such a goof, and here we are in the boat. We got so wet. And here's the whole family behind the waterfall. And here, where's she going? - Paige? (emotional music) - I'm gonna let you lead. - Okay. - Oh, remain standing, please. I'd like to show you what I've been working on for the girls. This book contains maps and clues. - This is beautiful. You did this? - I did, and I made one for each of the cabins. Now the maps are all the same, but the riddles and clues are all different. - For what? - Well, for the girls of course. I don't want them all following the same path to the treasure hunt. - A treasure hunt? - Yes, I believe your theme of mentorship is a very good one, Lisa. - Thank you. - And this game will help augment that theme. So there are clues and riddles in there that will help lead the teams to the final spot. - Well, what's the treasure gonna be? - Well, that's for the two of you to decide. I believe you'll know what to do. - We will? - Yes. - Okay. - This is gonna be really fun and exciting for the girls, teaching competition between the cabins. - But, shouldn't we be teaching cooperation instead of competition? - Well, both skills are needed to be successful in life, and both skills will be needed in order to complete this task. - Well, these clues are just so- - Intricate. - Complicated. When are they expected to do this? - Well, in between their horse riding sessions and their other camp activities. - This is difficult. I mean, too difficult between doing this and activities, and enjoying the summer. - Challenges are good. It builds character. I did not take you for a worrier, Lisa. - I'm not worried. I have a few suggestions. - Happy hunting, girls. (birds chirping) - Hi, Paige. - Miss Lisa. - Really haven't seen you with the other girls today. - This is way easier. No sad girls, no hurt feelings, and if the characters get sad or difficult, I can just, and read another day, or stop reading it altogether. - You can't do that with people. - No, you can't. - But do you really want to? You don't miss hanging out with the other girls? - I have a friend at home. - Ah, I see. And you don't wanna hang out with the whole group? - I've closed that book, Miss Lisa, and I'm not really sure I wanna open it again. (emotional music) (Lisa sighs) - I'm hearing everything that you're saying, Lisa, but conflict is a natural part of life. - I'm simply saying we can take Paige, and put her in another cabin, where she'll be more comfortable, and avoid the conflict. - There are so many experiences that some of the girls will have that others won't. But, every single one of them will experience conflict with someone else at some point in their lives, and you keep trying to shield them from that, Lisa. - Shielding them? Well, I can see how it looks that way, but I just want Paige to have a good summer. - Then tackle it head on. Find out what's at the heart of the matter, and then figure out a way to guide them through this. (emotional music) (rooster crows) (emotional music continues) (emotional music continues) (emotional music continues) (emotional music continues) (emotional music continues) - Oh my gosh, you are not going to believe what juicy info I just learned. - What? - What? - Tell us. - I wanna know! - Tell me. - Okay. So Miss Lisa was talking to Miss Rebecca, and said that Paige's parents are getting a divorce. I guess that means her dad's moving out while she's here for the month. - Oh. - Oh my god. - How embarrassing for her. I could not show my face if my parents dumped me at camp just to ruin my life. (door slams) - Kayla, did you just repeat a private conversation? That is not BR girl behavior. - Sorry. - Sorry. - I'm sorry I repeated a private conversation. - I mean, it's just not your story to share. I mean, if Paige wants to share about her parents getting a divorce and her father moving out, then she absolutely can because- - My father's moving out? - Paige. Guys, this conversation is not over. (emotional music) Paige! Oh my goodness, I am so sorry about what happened back there. I thought I was having a private conversation with Miss Lisa. I didn't know that Kayla was listening. - Is my dad really moving out while I'm here? - You didn't know? Wow. I really dropped the ball on this one. I'm so sorry you had to find out this way. Your mom called the camp, and she talked to Miss Lisa, but we thought you already knew. - They don't tell me anything. I got the whole, Mom and Dad still love you speech, then off I was sent. - I'm so sorry. Look, I'm not gonna make any excuses for them, or give you some big speech or anything, but I will tell you that my parents got divorced when I was just a little bit older than you. Even though it's still really hard, things do get better. - Everyone's going to stare at me, like oh, poor Paige. - Yeah, I felt the same way. I was so self-conscious, and I pulled away from all my friends. But, you know what I learned? - What's that? - All my friends, well all my real friends, they were there for me. - Ruby said she'd be mortified if this happened to her. - Yeah, it was not a great start, but I believe in the BR girls, and I have a feeling that they'll come around, and they'll be here for you after all. - The thought of my dad packing up while I'm here? - Yeah, I know. It was the small animals that helped me get through my summer. I would hug them and just cry. You wanna know a secret? Sometimes, I even swore. (both chuckle) You know, since I'm a junior counselor this year, I actually get to run this area, and I'd love a helper. Cool, 'cause animals, they're always there for us, and I'm here too. Even after summer. I'll give you my number, and you can text me if you ever need anything. We're BR girls. We stick together. - Thank you. (chickens clucking) (crickets chirping) - Goodnight, sleep tight. Don't let the bedbugs bite. - There's bedbugs? - No, no, no, no, it's just a saying. You don't have anything to worry about, Kayla and I are here. - Okay, goodnight. - Goodnight. (someone knocking) - What was that? - I'm scared. - It's just the door. - Well, somebody get it. I'm ready for bed. (crickets chirping) (door creaks) (plucky music) - Random. (door creaks) The first part, so close, so near. To learn so much, you mustn't fear. Friendship can be rough, stand true. Bond again, I'll tell what next you must do. What is this? - It's a treasure hunt! - The first part, so close, so near. To learn so much, you mustn't fear. Friendship can be rough, stand true. Bond again, I'll tell what next you must do. - That doesn't tell us anything. - Well, at the bottom it says turn page. But there's nothing. (gentle music) (gentle music continues) (yawns) - Good morning. (plucky music) (plucky music continues) - No fair, everyone's already found their first clue, but we're just- - Stuck, yeah. - Read it again. - The first part, so close, so near. To learn so much, you mustn't fear. Friendship can be rough, stand true. Bond again, I'll tell what next you must do. - What does that mean? - I don't know, but it does say to turn page, but when I turn it, there's nothing. - So it's a pretty big place, but once you get familiar, it's really easy to find your way around. The other animals live over there, and- - You know, Lisa, when I first saw you, you looked so familiar. - Oh yeah? Oh, the lake is over there, and the bridge. We have two. - Lakes? - Bridges. - But then I figured out who you are. - Who's that? Oh, the apple orchard is over there, and that's where the horses run- - Lisa, stop. Look at me, really look at me. Who do you see? (emotional music) - Timmy? Farm boy Timmy? Oh my! - Farm boy Timmy, I have not been called that since- - Probably middle school? - Middle school, yes. I wasn't sure if you'd remember me. That's why it took me so long to bring it up. - This is crazy. - Of course, Ms. LaMarsh does still call me Timmy, but- - Of course she does. - To everybody else, I am Tim. - Sorry, gotcha. - No, it's totally fine. Still, it's one of the best jobs I've ever taken. - I know the vet. - You know the vet. - Oh, we gotta tell Stacy. - Sure. - Wait, you two know each other? - Yeah. - Yeah, my parents used to take me to visit all these different farms, and orchards when I was a kid. - And my parents actually owned one of those orchards. One that she and her parents visited, pretty frequently actually. - Yes, but yours was always my favorite. - Well. - Because of the horses. - Because of the horses. - Yeah. But, those visits, that's how my parents ended up meeting Mr. C, and that's how I ended up at BR. - Huh, that is a small world. - Yeah. - Yep. - Well, we're gonna keep on our walk. Got a lot more of the campgrounds to see, so let you get back to your work. - Yes. Oh, Stacy? Sam said that she wanted to talk to you. - About what? - I don't know, it seemed personal. - [Stacy] Okay, bye.

(Sam sighs) - Well, I graduated high school a few weeks ago. - I know, congratulations. - And I started seeing this guy. - Is this a good thing? - He's really cute. - Okay, cute is good, but it's not the only thing. - I know. He's older than I am. - How old? - Like, your age. Like, 26. - Okay, well I'll hold off judgment. Go on. - Anyway, he wants to do things that I don't think I'm ready for. - I see. - And I'm scared. And I'm scared that if I don't, I'll lose him. - You know, you are an amazing woman, Sam. Every woman here is, and you deserve to wait for as long as you want to, no matter how long that is. And if any guy leaves because of that, then believe me, you didn't lose him, he lost you. - Thanks. I know you're right, I just, I needed to hear someone else say it. - Watermelon for ya? - No thank you. - Would you like a cookie? - I want a cookie. - One or two? - Um, two. - Thank you. - You're welcome. (people chattering) Oranges? - Macaroni. - Come on girls, let's go! Pipe down and get in line! Come on, let's go, let's go! Quiet down, and line up. - [Lunch Lady] Watermelon or pineapple? - How 'bout some macaroni, too? Would you like some of that? Let's get some of that. Get in line, come on, speak up out there. One or two? Come on, everyone. Quiet down out there. (people chattering) (people continue chattering) - Hey, Lisa. Stacy needs you in the barn, right now. - Bye. Anyways, so Taylor and Kayla are their names. - Hey, one of the junior counselors said you were looking for me. - Remember when Tim said that Sugarcane wasn't gonna give birth until next week? - Mm-hmm. - But, Lisa? (upbeat country music) - Oh, I think this is happening soon. - We have to call Tim. - Do we? - No, no, no, no, no. You're gonna get me in so much trouble. (horse whinnies) (horse snorts) (horse whinnies) (Lisa grunting) Lisa, don't get it on your shoe. (horse snorts) (horse whinnies) Ew, ugh. (Lisa grunting) (horse whinnies) (upbeat country music continues) (upbeat country music continues) Aw, Lisa. You made a horse. - I made a horse. (Lisa sighs) (door creaks) - How is our, um? - The mare? - Mare, yes. - She's resting, but that's to be expected. Other than that, she's doing quite well. - And the? - Colt? - Yes. - Healthy as a horse. Sorry, bad joke. I learned that one from a veterinarian who I, the colt is also very healthy, ma'am. - Good, here's your remittance, as promised. - You know, I didn't deliver the- - A deal is a deal. - Thank you. You know, what Lisa did, it's very impressive. - I'm inclined to agree with you, but you will stay on as a registered veterinarian. Please continue to come to camp once per week. - Yes, ma'am. Thank you. (crickets chirping) Hey, how was your shower? - Long, much needed. - I know the feeling. I've delivered quite a few colts. - That's gotta be a spectacular feeling, being a veterinarian? - It is. And, can I tell you a secret perk? - What's that? - The once a year or so that I find myself at a really expensive, high class function and I'm totally out of place? I get to introduce myself as Dr. Levine. (Tim chuckles) But I'm a country doctor. I make a living, but some of my people, they still pay me in chicken and eggs. - Money's just money. - That's right. - And you get the sunrises, and the sunsets. - Yes, I do. I've gotten to work the farms, ranches, rodeos, even go up to the UP to work the dogsled races. You know, I've gotten to hunt fish, camp, canoe, and kayak every single inch of Michigan. - Sounds like an amazing life. - It's been good, and I'm glad that you feel that way, too. - Why me? - I like you, Lisa. I know that we just reconnected, but I look forward to coming here every single week, to see you, and when the summer's over, I don't want that to end. - Um. I don't know if this is the right time to have this conversation? I mean, Sugarcane. She just gave birth, she's recovering. She needs rest. I, I need rest. I think everyone needs rest. So, I'm gonna go check on her. (plucky music) - I don't need rest. Guess you gotta get some rest. You need rest, I need rest, everybody needs rest. Mr. C's probably taking a nap. Everybody needs rest! Everybody needs to get rest. - Tim. Why are you so agitated? So glad to hear that colt's healthy delivery, but I can't imagine that's what your pacing's about. It must have something to do with Lisa. - No, I just told Lisa exactly how I feel about her. - Well hey, that's great. - Yeah, and she completely ignored me. - Oh. - It's been a great summer, Larry. Honestly, it has. I've liked it. I've liked getting to come here once a month, but I'm done. I did what I was hired to do. I'm gonna go out there, I'm gonna finish my rounds, and then I'm getting in my truck, and I'm outta here. - But that's fair. You've completed your duties, but do you really like Lisa? - Yeah, yeah, yes! Yes, I like her! - Well, then why are you willing to give up so easily? You're just like my brother, Jerry. Gives up too quickly on love. It takes work, lots of it. - You didn't hear what she just said to me. - Well, you should hear some of the things my wife says to me. Okay, what'd she say? - I poured my heart out to the girl. She looked right at me and she said, let's think about Sugarcane. Sugarcane needs rest, you need rest, everybody needs rest. - I don't know Lisa all that well, but I do know it takes time for her to progress things. So right now, she's probably going over the conversation with Stacy. - You told him what? Why? - You think so? - Yeah, I do, I really do. - I don't know. I got nervous. - And if you really like her, you'll give her a second chance. Go to her again, and just tell her how much you like her. And if she's still not interested, then pack your bags and leave. But I'd hope you stay for the summer. You're part of the family now. (emotional music) - Thank you, Larry. You're right. You're right, I, you know, I really needed to hear somebody say that. - You're welcome anytime. - I'm just standing there thinking, does this guy like me? - Well, I told you Tim likes you, but wow. He really likes you. - Me? - Yes, you, Lisa. - Why me? - Why not you? - Because, guys don't like girls like me, Stacy. They like girls like you. - I wish I could show you all the amazing things I see when I look at you, like how incredible you are. How much the girls love and admire you. You're beautiful, Lisa. On the inside, but also on the outside. Can I ask you a question? - What's that? - How do you feel? - About Tim? - There is one guy on this entire ranch, Lisa, so I think you know who I'm talking about. And since you answered that way, I'm going to assume you like him, too. - I mean, he's nice. - And cute. - I guess. - Lisa! - Okay, fine, yes. - He likes you. - I don't know. - He could've asked anyone for a tour of camp, or he could've just gotten into his car and gone home. But he asked you. - I'm just not used to a guy- - A cute guy, a nice guy, a veterinarian? - If I'm being honest, I just don't know what he'd see in me. - Well, you're a better person than me. You always have been. - That's not true. - Yes, it is, Lisa. When we were kids here together, I always felt so superior to you. I was prettier- - That's subjective, but. - Thinner, richer. I was a far better rider. - Okay, those are all objectively true. - What else was there? - We don't need the whole list, Stacy. - Right. Right, I'm sorry. But there's another list, one that I didn't understand when I was 12, 15, or even 20. I get it now. Kindness, fairness, empathy, selflessness. - You have all those qualities too, Stacy. - No, Lisa, I don't. Not naturally. I mean, maybe I wasn't taught those things at home. Well, we know I wasn't. - Yeah. - I'm too old to blame my faults on my upbringing. Who I am is up to me, and I'm becoming better at it, every day, every summer I'm here at BR, and every time I'm with you. - With me? - You're my mentor, Lisa. You always have been, even when I didn't know it. - I don't know what to say, Stacy. - Say you'll let me help you. You deserve a chance at happiness, and maybe this is it, and maybe it's not. But you're not gonna pass up on finding out just because you don't think you're good enough. You are beyond good enough, Lisa. - Thank you. - So I'm gonna ask you one more time, do you like Tim? - Well, I think we both know that I do. - Then tell him that! Doesn't have to be complicated. - I'm the best friend, Stacy. I am not the girlfriend. I'm not ready. I don't know what to say. - Then get ready. Go practice what to say. You have to start seeing yourself as both.

Holding animals in the land and sky. - The neighbor has to be the lake. - And the first part has to be the tree. - Wow, you guys are so good at this. - Are you guys quite sure about this? I mean, the lake and the tree? - Pretty sure, but only one way to find out. - Let's go. (upbeat music) - [Stacy] Lisa, Lisa. - Stacy, stop. Take a breath. - I rushed down here as soon as I could. - Okay. - Nobody saw me. - Saw you? - Can I talk to you alone? - Did you not want the horses to hear? - So I was talking to Ms. LaMarsh, and she said that Tim's leaving. He was looking everywhere for you. - What? I have to hide. - What, no! Lisa, your instincts are terrible. You have to go find him. - Find him and say what? I haven't had time to practice what I'm gonna say. - Are you really willing to let him leave without telling him how you truly feel? - Well, I don't, no. I don't know what to say. - Well, when you see him, just close your eyes and speak from the heart. - Okay. Okay. But, the grounds are really big. I don't even know where to look for him. - We're gonna break some rules. - We are? - Give me your phone. - My phone? - Come on. - What are you doing? - Texting Tim. - Oh boy. - And send. - Now what? - Well, now we wait, and we hope that he texts back. - I think I'm the one having an anxiety attack now. (phone chirps) - Ooh, this is exciting. - What'd he say? - Oh. - What? - It's Ms. LaMarsh. - Okay. - She wants to see us in her office. - I'm not happy about this, Stacy. I'm not happy about any of this. - I called you both here to make a confession, and an apology. At the start of this, I could not think of anything worse. A horse camp in the summer, with a bunch of kids? (Ms. LaMarsh laughs) Okay, woo, okay. You know, I thought well, at least I can bring some new things for the girls to learn. Some new things for you guys to learn, but I never thought you could teach me anything. But I was wrong. I have learned so much from you two. Stacy, I really admire your patience. Now I've watched you work, and you truly are an excellent head riding instructor. - Thank you. - And Lisa, I admire your passion. Now, I really understand why Mr. C speaks so highly of you. - Thank you. - And that is why I felt it necessary to tell you, face to face, that BMG has decided to sell horse camp. - What? - Mr. C wouldn't. - Mr. C is still the largest shareholder, but everyone else thinks that this land is just too valuable to remain a camp. A golf resort would make much more sense financially. - But, what about your vote? - Well, I'm only 10% owner. Although, it is true that my vote added to Mr. C's would preserve camp, and I've seen firsthand, ladies, what a worthwhile camp this is. But, I just can't make business sense of it. Thank you for meeting with me. - Thank you for letting us know. Come on, Stacy. We have a few days left, and we owe it to these girls to make it the best summer of their lives. I'm not happy about this, either. - Well, the selling of camp isn't my fault, Lisa. - Intellectually, I know that, but emotionally, it still feels like it is. - Well, did Tim at least text you back? - Nope. Not happy about that. I'm not happy about any of this. (pleasant music) (pleasant music continues) (pleasant music continues) (someone knocking) - What was that? - I'm scared. - It's just the door. - Will someone answer it? I'm ready for bed. (suspenseful music) - It's the final clue. (suspenseful music continues) When the day is new, here's what you'll do. Look for someone standing so clear and true. Near where you cross, it's gray not blue. - Who's good at riddles? - I'll try it. When the day is new, that has to be morning. - Right. - When the day is new, here's what you'll do. Look for someone standing so clear and true. Near where you cross, it's gray not blue. - Someone will be there, but the question is, where is there? - Just hold on. - Where we cross. - The bridge! - We leave in the morning. - Yes! (gentle music) (hand pats) - I've been waiting for someone else to wake up for over an hour. - Let's wake up the other girls. - But do we have to start now? - Come on, everyone. The early bird gets the worm. (girls groaning) - Ow. - [Girl] Let's go, let's go, let's go. (girls chattering) - To the right! - Okay, now what? - Look for someone standing so clear and true, but nobody's here. - Maybe we're too early? - It's gray nor blue. What kind of person's blue? - Or gray? - A statue. - Mrs. D! (girls chattering) - Good morning, ladies. - Good morning. - [Lisa] Congratulations, you are the first group to complete the treasure hunt. - What's our prize? - Black River is your prize. The lessons that you learn here, and the friendships that you make. Both will last a lifetime, and we have Mrs. D to thank for that. She was a true leader. And she had a vision to create Black River for all of us. Even though she's gone now, we still benefit from her mentorship every day. Can I make a suggestion? Take some time, and just be with each other. Go sit on the dock, enjoy the rest of the morning. Treasure every moment you can.

A beautiful setting. Well, I have lots of work to do, so why don't you join the other girls and play? - Okay, I just wanted to say thank you for bringing me here. I love you, Mom. (emotional music) (emotional music continues) - Tom? Yes Tom, it's Bethany LaMarsh here. I've had a change of heart. I'm sorry, but I won't be able to sell you the ranch after all. Why? Because I'm going outside to find my daughter to take her for a ride on a horse, that's why. Goodbye. (no audio) - Hi, Lisa. - Hi, Stacy. - What is this for? - For trying. For being my friend. You know, hundreds of girls had a great time here this summer, and you were a big part of that. This is BR's last summer, and I'm glad I got to spend it with you. - Thank you, Lisa. And I'm glad I got to spend the summer with you, too. But I have news. - What's that? - Ms. LaMarsh decided not to sell the camp. - What? - Yes! - Really? - Yes! - How? - I don't know! - Oh my god, this is amazing. - I know, right? Oh, and Tim is looking for you. - Really? - Yeah, he's here. - Okay. - Go find him. (emotional music) - You know, Lisa, when the summer's over, if you wanted to go to grad school, I do know a certain veterinarian who would write you an amazing letter of recommendation to my alma mater. - Really? - Absolutely. And when you're done, I sure could use a partner, in every aspect of life.
