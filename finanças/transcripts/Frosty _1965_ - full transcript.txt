(uptempo orchestral music) - An old man and an old woman lived in a village with their daughters. Nastenka was the daughter of the old man. Marphuska was the old woman's daughter. (soft instrumental music) (girl snoring loudly) (mosquito buzzing) (girl groans softly) (girl sneezes) - [Marphuska] Mama. (groans) - Hey, come on, old man. Steel yourself. (body thuds) (woman groans) Shh. The mosquitoes are stinging my darling little Marphuska, and she can't sleep. - Oh, now listen. (woman grunts) Right, I didn't say a word. (birch branch rustles) (Marphuska groans) (woman hums) (woman whistles softly) (bed creaks) (man hums) (bed creaks) - What are you doing there, Nastenka? - Just knitting Marphuska's fur stalkings. - Knitting, eh? - Well, you told me to knit some stalkings-- - Be quiet! Of course I told you to knit, but I never told you to click your needles like that, did I? Before you know it, you'll wake my little darling. - Can she really hear that through those walls? - She certainly can. You work by day like a young mare so you can sleep by night, but darling little Marphuska cannot be a mare. She must not be. She has to rest by day so by night the slightest noise wakes her. (mouth blows) (footsteps patter) Here's a place where you can knit, Nastenka, and you won't wake my darling little Marphuska. The moon is out, there's plenty of light. (inhales) It's peaceful and it's nice and cool. (dog barks) Be quiet! (dog snorts) You give me so much work. The stalking must be finished by the time the rooster crows, do you hear me? (groans) Otherwise, my precious little girl, I will tear you braid off, hmph! (melancholic instrumental music) - Jaba, Jaba! (dog barks softly) (teeth crunch) Shh. (man hums) (bed creaks) (melancholic instrumental music) (tongue slurps) (Marphuska grunts softly) (knitting needles click) (Marphuska snores softly) (knitting needles click) (Marphuska snores) (knitting needles click rapidly) (Marphuska grunts softly) (melancholic instrumental music) (gentle instrumental music) (rooster wings flap) Down, Jabushka! (rooster squawks) - Give me a little time please, pretty rooster. Please, I've only got one road in there. (rooster squawks) - [Rooster] Roosters can only obey the sun. (clucks) You'll have to ask Rosy-Fingered Dawn! (gentle instrumental music) (melancholic instrumental music) (rooster squawks) (footsteps patter) - Have mercy, Rosy-Fingered Dawn. Have mercy on me, oh rising golden sun. Wait till I'm done knitting these stalkings. Otherwise, I'll be punished severely. Stepmother said she would tear off my braid. (knitting needles click softly) (melancholic instrumental music) (gentle instrumental music) Thank you, Rosy-Fingered Dawn! (rooster clucks) My darling bird with the golden comb. (rooster clucks) I'm so happy, my pretty one. Thank you, it's done. (rooster clucks) You see, I'm finished. - You lazy girl, have you finished yet? - Look. - So you did it on time. Why you wicked little viper, you wicked little witch! I'll give you much harder work next time. In the meantime, go feed the chickens, water the cattle, split the wood, and sweep the yard. - Oh! - Hmph! (melancholic instrumental music) - Jabushka. (lips smack) (rooster crows loudly) (roosters crowing) (solemn music) (solemn instrumental music) - [Narrator] On the very same morning of the very same day, but in another village. (chickens cluck) (wood blocks rattle) (rooster crows) - Ivan, my son. - Yes, Mama, what is it now? - You must take care. - Oh,, don't worry. - You mustn't forget your mother, Ivan. - [Ivan] Don't worry. - You mustn't harm the weak! - [Ivan] Don't worry! - Honor those who are old! - [Ivan] Don't worry! (birds trill) (cheery instrumental music) (goose squawks) (woman singing in foreign language) (woman shouts rhythmically) (woman singing in foreign language) (uptempo instrumental music) (women singing in foreign language) (woman shouting rhythmically) (women laughing) (cheery orchestral music) (Ivan singing in foreign language) (Ivan whistles rhythmically) (Ivan singing in foreign language) (Ivan whistles rhythmically) (Ivan singing in foreign language) (Ivan whistles rhythmically) - [Bandits] We will rob them, we won't rob them. We will eat them, we won't eat them. We will beat them, we'll be beaten. - Bah! - [Bandits] We will rob them, we won't rob them. We will eat them, we won't eat them. We will beat them. (knuckles knock) We'll be beaten. We will rob them, we won't rob them. We will eat them, we won't eat them. (bandits caws) (Ivan whistles rhythmically) (Ivan whistles rhythmically) (footsteps patter) - [First Bandit] Ha! - [Second Bandit] Ho! (footsteps patter) - You're captured! And now, young man, we're going to rob you. - Do you mean that? - Yes, we do. - All right, rob me. (bandits chatter) (bandits shout) (dramatic whooshing) (bandits shout) (Ivan grunts) (dramatic whooshing) (bandits shout) (Ivan grunts) (dramatic whooshing) - Why don't those clubs come down again? - (chuckles) Just wait, my eager little bandits. They'll come down next winter. - [Leader] Next winter? - That's right. (Ivan whistles) - Next winter, he said. - Did you see that man? That takes muscle, huh? He's strong all right. (bandits chatter) - That's odd. - [Narrator] How long did our young hero, Ivan, wander over hill and dale? Frankly, we have no idea. The fact remains that Ivan eventually reached far away and unknown lands. (dreamy music) - Ivanushka! (playful music) Ivanushka. Ivanushka. (bell dinging) (playful music) (bells dinging) - All right, who's playing hide and seek with me now? (bell dinging) - Me. - Who? You. - Yes. - Are you a sorcerer, granddaddy? - I dabble in sorcery a little, but the truth is that I get bored. - You get bored? - I get bored. Come on, play with me. Let's play hide and seek together. - (laughs) With you, play hide and seek? - Yes. - You're joking. I'd catch you in no time. - Think so? - Yes, I think so. - If you catch me, I'll give you a well-bent bow and some nice straight arrows. Is that a bargain? - [Ivan] It's a bargain, Father Mushroom. (playful music) - Ivanushka! (playful music) Coo coo! (bell dings) (playful music) (bell dings) (suspenseful music) (footsteps patter) (suspenseful music) (playful music) Ivanushka! (bell dings) (suspenseful music) (bell dings) (suspenseful music) (bell dings) Can't catch me, can't catch me, can't catch me! (playful music) (bell dings) Well, you didn't catch me. - All right, you win. - Good boy, Ivan. Since you admit you lost, I'm going to give you the things I promised. (bell tolls) (gong bangs) (suspenseful music) - Oh, it's a miracle. - Well, without miracles, where would we be? - Oh, you're a real magician. (metal clangs) (arrow thuds) (cheery music) - Ivan? - Yes? - Come back here. - [Ivan] Why? - You have forgotten the most important thing, Ivan. - And what have I forgotten? - You forgot to say thank you to a very old man. You should bow your head down to the ground. - Those who bow run the risk of losing their head. - Ivan. - The bear will bow before you if you like, not Ivan. - Then so be it. Things will come to pass as you say. The bear will bow before me down to the ground, but it is your back that will bend. (bell dings) (suspenseful music) (dramatic music) - Find a feather in the field and throw it to the winds. If you follow that feather, you will find your destiny. (suspenseful music) (suspenseful music) (arrow whooshes) (bird squeals) (bird thuds) (somber music) (birds warble) (gentle music) (woman singing in foreign language) (gentle instrumental music) (woman singing in foreign language) (bird warbles) (woman sings in foreign language) (gentle instrumental music) (water splashes softly) (birds chirp) (birds warble) (water splashes) (water splashes) (birds chirp) (birds warble) How do you do, my pretty little maid? (Nastenka gasps) (sighs) You're the prettiest little thing I've ever seen. Oh, don't be afraid of me. Look at me at me, my pretty one. Look at me, look at me all you like. Now, am I not worth looking at? - I have no time to speak to you, I've got to work. - What are you doing? - I'm watering this old stump. - How long will you go on watering it? - I'll water it until flowers start to bloom on it. - Flowers? - My stepmother told me to. - Oh, you must have a very wicked stepmother. - Oh no, stepmothers are stepmothers. - What's your name? - Well, my name is Nastya. - Nastya? - Mm-hmm, that's not what everybody calls me. My father calls me Nastenka. - Nastenka. - Sister says Nastika. Step-mother calls me viper and sometimes little witch. - Nastenka? - Hmm? - [Ivan] Darling, will you marry me? - You're in a terrible hurry. - Well, I'm not crippled or cross-eyed, am I? - I know you're not. I don't think we would ever make a good couple though. - What do you mean? - Why you're a braggart, I'm not. - So you think I'm a braggart? I'll have you know I really can do everything. - Oh? - Yes, I'm a very good plowman. Nobody can outfight me. I'm a good worker, a fishermen and a dancer. And a hunter. Here, I'll show you. (bears groan) I'll shoot that bear down with only one arrow. - No, don't, don't do that, she has cubs! - Cubs? Well, what if she has? - Jaba, Jaba, Jaba! (dog barks) (Ivan groans) - [Ivan] Hey, Nastya! (bell dings) (suspenseful music) (Ivan growls softly) (Nastenka gasps) Nastya. What's the matter? Nastya. Nastenka. (somber music) She's alive. (Ivan growls) What did you do to me? What have you done, you witch? (growls) - Ivanushka! Ivanushka, I swear I didn't do anything to you! - I curse you! I curse you forever, you witch! (Ivan growls) (solemn music) (bell dinging) (gentle music) (Nastenka cries) (Ivan groans) I killed you with an arrow, and you ruined me with a feather. (growls) If you hadn't behaved like a bear, you wouldn't have the head of a bear. (dramatic music) (bear growls) - Ivan, Ivan, with the head of a bear. - Forgive me, Father Mushroom. Forgive me, please. - You see, Ivan. Things have come to pass as we said. The bear bows his head to the ground, but it's you're back that is bent. - Oh, teach me how to be reasonable. And first of all, tell me exactly what I should do so that I may be a man again. - All right, listen. Vagabond with the head of a bear. Just look at yourself and ask, how did you live? You see, you spent all of your time boasting to everybody. You loved yourself, you loved only yourself. You offended everyone else. Take Nastenka, you hurt her feelings. - I hurt her feelings? - You've never done a good deed, Ivan. Now here's my answer. Here's my advice to you. Although I'm wondering whether you can understand it. - Of course I understand! I'll just go and do a good deed. When I've done a good deed, I'll get my old head back. - Ivan! Ivan! (tense music) You haven't understood anything. (dramatic whooshing) (mountain rumbles) (cheery instrumental music) - Hello, tell me what good deeds can I do for you? (women scream) Stop! Wait! Don't run away! Wait, I want to do a good deed for you. Wait, wait! (women scream) Oh! (cries) (birds chirp) (animal hoots) (bear growls) (bears growl) (girls scream) - Oh bears! Bear! - There's a bear over there, a werewolf! (women scream) (melancholic instrumental music) - Good morning, little flowers, little flowers on the stone. (melancholic instrumental music) Every single day I come to see you. Every single day I come to talk to you. I hope that I'm not bothering you. It's all right? Can you tell me, little flowers, is Ivan still living today? He's alive? He must be angry with me, I suppose. You mean he's not? Now tell me, will we ever meet? (melancholic instrumental music) (birds chirp) (Ivan growls) - Charity, dear little sisters, dear little brothers. Charity, dear little sisters, dear little brothers, charity. Give us alms for without us you could not prove your charity. Give me alms for my daily bread. Give to a poor orphan who's homeless, penniless, crippled, and blind. Give to the poor, the blind-- - How much have you in your cup? - Not a copper, not. (gasps) - Well, if that's the case, here's a copper. (coins jangle) To do a good deed, I suppose that one copper isn't enough. Where are you going? - A werewolf! Run for your life! A werewolf! A werewolf! (birds chirp) (Ivan groans) - What kind of a good deed will I have to do? - How sweet. Nastenka, let's have the braid, quickly! - Here. - Mama? - Mm-hmm. - Why not smear her eyebrows? - A ha. (women laugh) Oh how lovely you look. - Mama. Nastenka's braid is nicer than mine is. - Yours is worth more, it was bought at the fair. - I want you to cut off her braid at the root! - What could I drag her by without a braid on her head, I ask you? - Cut if off! - Wait I know. I'll put a rag over her braid to hide it. - All right then, hide it. Hmm. Oh. - Ah, you munch and guzzle, eh? It's much easier than working, hmm! (Marphuska laughs) There, you viper, see! Now you're dressed for housework. And now my darling you put this on. Like a princess, darling. Exactly like a princess, huh? - Really? - Uh huh. (stepmother laughs) - A princess. - A little red. There you are. - I'm all tired and I'm sweating. - Learn to suffer. (Marphuska groans) There. No, not a princess. - Oh no? - You are a queen! - Hmm. Hmm! - What kind of a good deed can I do? (woman groans) - (groans) I can't walk another step. - Poor granny, here, let me help you. - Yes, my boy, help me. And it will be a good deed. - It will be a good deed? - Help me. - Oh yeah. I'd be glad to help, I need to do a good deed. I need to very badly. - This is one. - Get on. - What do I get on? - On my back. - On your back? - Climb on. (women laughs) Do you live far from here, granny? - Oh yes, very, very far. It's up the mountain then down again. And up the mountain on the other side. - Hey, that sounds very good. - Well, if you think so, that's fine, but don't get all in a sweat. - Here we go. - Giddy up, let's go. - Let me tell you, Marphuska's a fine girl. She's such a darling. She works day and night, sews the nets all the time. Except in the morning, when she gulps down her tea and lights the fire and gets the breakfast. Then she mops the floor. And then when the breakfast is ready she-- - I tell you, she's a marvel. She's perfect in every respect. And no dream princess could be lovelier. (women laugh) (spoon bangs) - This matchmaker can certainly talk. I think there was something else we wanted. - Yes. - We hear you have another daughter. - Good lord, people say the craziest things. I am Mama's only daughter. The other one's not my sister. - That's all right. We'll have a look at the other one, if you don't mind. - Mama? - Uh, uh. Well, all right. You'll see her, since you insist. Nastenka. Nastenka. Nastenka. Nastika, come here! (stepmother grunts) Get in there, you little viper! Nastenka, sweetheart of mine, my honey child. Come, let these folks look at you. - Mm-hmm. No, matchmaker, this one won't do at all. She looks like a scarecrow. - Yes. Our little idiot is really horrible looking. The spitting image of her father. (stepmother barks) - I won't say it, I'll be quiet. - All right, now start the feast, my dear guests. - That's what I've been waiting for. I drink to your health. - That's all very well, but my son likes goose giblets. That's his favorite dish. - Ah yes. (chuckles) - Nastika! - Ah no, your lovely daughter should take care of it. It's up to her. That's the custom, you know. - Mama. - That way my son and I can see what kind of a bride we're getting. (Marphuska groans) (Ivan grunts) - Go on this way, dear boy. - Boy, it's really hot. - And can you see some old tumbledown houses yet? - I see them. - Well they're my castles, boy. - Oh! - Yes. Come on, hurry, hurry or you'll catch cold. Can't you feel it, that cold mountain wind? Come on, faster, faster! (laughs) Here we are, we're home at last. Yes, at last we're home. And my home is my castle. I'm much obliged to you, my handsome prince. - Huh? Look, granny, are you making fun of me? - Of course not. - [Ivan] Look at me before you call me handsome. - I can't very well do that, my boy. It's been at least... Yes, it's been 10 years since I last looked at something. You see, I'm blind. - Oh, grandma. I wish I could have gone blind for you. - Oh no, how you talk. - Father Mushroom lied. - Who did? - And I'll never look at myself again. (dramatic music) (Marphuska groans) (geese quack) - What do you say, son? - Let me talk. He likes her very much. Anybody can see she's lovely, such beauty. She's in perfect health, I tell you, all over! (water splashes) (geese quack) - Mama! (women groan) (children laugh) (geese quack) - Marphuska, my darling daughter! - Help! Mama! (children laugh) - Hold on tight! - Marphusenka! - My daughter, my daughter! (children shout) - Pull her out! - Mama! - Look, my dear, maybe you should have tied it tighter. - (grunts) Forget my daughter then. Oh, my sweet little dear. - What? There's no telling what bride a boy will take. And my son's not stupid. He's ready to take a wife, aren't you? But not that one. (braid slaps) (Marphuska cries) (women cry) He likes her. (geese quack) - Nastenka's the one I want. (chuckles) (group laughs) (Ivan growls) (gentle music) (Ivan groans) - Her stick, granny's stick. How is she going to be able to walk without it? I've got to take it to her. - Very good, Ivanushka, very good. (mystical music) - Maybe I'm dreaming, maybe it's just a vision. Maybe that old magician was only bragging. Still, he cast a spell on me. Where's that feather that brought me here? And this is where I first met Nastenka. (solemn music) And there's that old stump. And the flowers have really bloomed. But that wicked old magician's laughing at me, I suppose. I can't shake off his spell. (stick thuds) (bells ding) There's only one thing I still have to do. Farewell, Nastenk... (thrilling music) (water splashes) (solemn music) Nastenka! - [Narrator] The weeks have passed. The winter winds have begun to blow. The old man takes his daughter into the heart of the forest. Not that he wants to do this at all. It was the cantankerous old woman's idea. She had insisted for so long. Mad for so long, that the poor old man finally yielded to her will. - [Stepmother] I keep trying to get Marphuska married, but everybody looks at that little viper Nastya. Take her far into the forest and lose her! I never want to see her again! (sled rumbles) (horse snorts) (solemn music) (tense music) - No, my old woman can go right ahead and kill me if she wants. Well, I'm not going to do this, not to you, my daughter. I won't leave you in the woods. Ho, Zorika, ho! Come on, boy, we're going back, ho! Ho, Zorika! I don't care if she waives the poker at me or the pitchfork. Let her rage. I'm not afraid anymore. No, my darling daughter, I'm not afraid anymore. I'll tell her what I think, you'll see. Ho, Zorika, ho! - She's going to make my poor daddy so miserable. She'll drive him mad. Goodbye, Daddy. Remember your daughter who loved you. (suspenseful music) - Nastya! (adventurous orchestral music) (suspenseful orchestral music) Nastya! (suspenseful music) - Ho, Zorika, ho! You over there in the house, come on, get moving! Open the doors wide, hurry! Whoa! Ho, Zorika! (dog barks) - Mama. - What's the matter with you? - That's enough. I'm not putting up with this anymore. Now it's my. - Oh! - I won't say it, I'll be quiet. (Marphuska laughs) - Marphuska, go on into the house. You'll catch cold, darling. (Marphuska laughs) You better watch out! - Oh, Nastenka's gone. (dog cries) Cheer up. Cheer up. (sinister music) - Oh, little cabin, turn your back to the forest and turn your face to me. (cabin squeaks) (door creaks) (fairy yawns) - What do you want? (grunts) Ivan, why did you come here? You were not invited! Now, you turned my house around and awakened me out of a sound sleep. The house had its back to you! Whatever made you turn it around? - Oh, don't be angry, hunchback fairy, don't be angry. (fairy shouts) Help me to find Nastenka. I must save her. Please, she needs help badly. - Don't expect any help from me. And I won't give you the slightest help! All right, little house! (bells ding) About face! Turn your back to Ivan and face the woods again! (house squeaks) - Turn your back to the woods and face me! - Face the woods, turn your back to Ivan! - House, face me with your back to the woods! - Face the woods, turn your back to Ivan! (chickens cluck) You hooligan! - I don't care how hard you try. I'm going to have the upper hand, face me! - Face the woods! - [Ivan] Face me! - Face the woods! - [Ivan] Face me! - Face the woods! - [Ivan] Face me! - Face the woods! - Face me! - Face the woods! - Face me! - Face the woods! All right. You'll see, you won't always have the upper hand. (groans) Your strength is only earthly strength. In the end, it won't help! I can always use witchcraft. Foul is fair, fair is foul! You'll give up yet, my young knight. (trees creak) (trees creak) (trees growl) (fairy moans gleefully) (trees creak) (trees growl) - [Trees] One, two, three! (body whooshes) (body crashes) (cymbals bang) (owl hoots) (fairy laughs) (tree whooshes) (tree whooshes) - This way, right this way, little pigeon! Ah, you'll make a fine roast for my supper! It's no use, Ivan, you can't win. Struggle, Ivan! Go on, fight back all you like! Nothing's going to stop me! You're my supper! - Look, hunchback fairy, I'm sorry. - Are you afraid? - Well, I've never been pushed into an oven. It's the first time I've sat on a shovel. (fairy laughs) (kazoo honks) Please show me how to sit on a shovel, I don't know how. - Get down! Take the handle! - All right. - What's the world coming to? The youth of today wasn't taught anything! You see, you don't have to be a wizard to do that, stupid! - I hope it's warm enough for you! - (screams) I'm cooking! I'm roasting, ah! - All right, get out of here or I'll turn you all into kindling! Go on, get out! (trees whoosh) Now run for your lives! (trees grunting) (oven rattles) - Please, let me out, it's hot in here! I'm sizzling, oh! I'm sweating! - Good old steam bath never hurt anybody. And now tell me, where is she? Tell me where I can find Nastenka. - Oh, find her, find her, find her! - Yes, tell me how I can save Nastenka. - Oh, save her, save her, save her! - All right, you old witch, in you go again. - No! - You'll cook a little longer. - No, Ivan, no! (owl hoots) (gentle instrumental music) (man singing in foreign language) (man singing in foreign language) (dramatic whooshing) (man singing in foreign language) (gentle instrumental music) (harp strings plucking) (harp strings plucking) (harp strings plucking) (harp strings plucking) (harp strings plucking) (harp strings plucking) (harp strings plucking) (somber music) - Where did this little marvel come from? Little girl, where were you until now? - I? At home. - At home. - Uh huh. - Tell me, don't you feel cold? - Oh, I feel warm enough, Grandfather Frost. - [Father Frost] You're warm. - I'm warm. (gentle music) - Even now are you warm, graceful creature? - I'm warm, Grandfather Frost. - [Father Frost] Bah! - I am warm, grandfather. - You're a very good girl. Not the contradicting kind. Here you are, my little marvel. Here's my cloak. - Oh, how about you then, you'll be cold. - Me, cold? (laughs) (bird chirps) - A bird! (bird chirps) (bell chimes) (Nastenka gasps) (bell chimes) - Don't bother, my sweet, it won't do any good. In my magic scepter lies the power that spreads the frost. - You have no pity, you're cruel! - Oh, I am not at all without pity. I am not cruel. I do pity this poor little frozen bird, but any living creature who touches my magic scepter will never wake up again. What's the matter, my sweet? - Goodbye, Grandfather Frost. - [Father Frost] What's wrong, pretty one? - I'm freezing. - Oh, oh, my sleigh! Quickly, quickly, my ice sleigh! My sleigh that flies like the wind! (mysterious music) (horses neigh) Whoa! Be brave. Don't lose heart. Don't lose hope, my sweet. You won't freeze, there you are. That's it. (chuckles) That's it. Don't worry, you'll see. There'll be dancing at your wedding yet. Ho, ho, on to my sleigh! (uptempo chiming music) (bear roars) Feeling warmer, my sweet? - Mm-hmm. (uptempo chiming music) (horses neigh) - Nastenka and love. It doesn't mean a thing. (lid scrapes) Yes, it's nothing but a joke. Here, take this, a sheepskin cloak. (Ivan gasps) (Ivan sneezes) Poor boy! You must mind your health, young man. You might catch cold. - Listen now, I-- - Shh! Foul is fair! (pig squeaks) Fair is foul! (pig squeaks) - What's that? - Oh, a fast sleigh, rides in the snow. As fast as the winds that blow. It skims by itself over the snow. Over the snow it skims by itself toward the place where Nastenka now lies. (suspenseful music) Look out for my sheepskin coat! It's almost new, don't forget to give it back to me! (fairy laughs) (suspenseful music) (fairy laughs) (fairy grunts) How weary I am. So weary, so very tired. My aching bones are very weary. My aching bones are very weary. (metal clangs) (groans) I ache all over. I'm so tired. (uptempo chiming music) (horses neigh) - [Father Frost] Whoa, my good sleigh! (pig squeals) (playful music) - Oh, I feel so ill, so ill, so ill! I haven't got a fever, I haven't caught cold! It's not illness! It is making we worse though! It's worthless, helping the poor orphan that I am! (cat hisses) (fairy groans) No, no! Oh, I can't sleep or eat, I feel low! I can't rest, I feel low! Oh, oh, that insolent whelp! He dared to insult the old hunchback fairy! (snake hisses) Here, I wanted to eat that young idiot, and instead of that I almost let myself get eaten up. Silly witch that I was! (cries) (snake hisses) (cat meows) Hello, kitty, my little kitty. Oh, you kitty with the velvet paw. Little kitty with the jet black coat. You kitty with the silken fur. (cat meows) You've got to help me, little kitty. Run, skip and fly over the snow. Go find Ivan's darling and cause her death, go! (cat meows) (fairy screeches) (suspenseful music) And now we shall laugh, wait and see! (laughs) (fairy laughs) (uptempo chiming music) (pig squeals) (uptempo chiming music) (tense music) (pig squeals) (cat hisses) (gentle music) - Don't you worry now, little girl. Everything will be all right, you see. He's never going to forget you. (chuckles) Well, I'm going out now. To take a look around and see how the birch trees and pines are doing. I must see to it that all is in order. And you will be the mistress of the house. (chuckles) (footsteps patter) You will take care of the house. I'll come back very soon.

Good widow's son. - Greetings, Grandfather Frost. - Have you come for Nastenka? - For Nastenk... (solemn music) (dog whelps) (solemn music) Nastenka. - She's asleep. (solemn violin music) - Why is she sleeping? Now, by day? - [Father Frost] Ivanushka, she sleeps day and night. (dog whelps) - I hurt your feelings, Nastenka. Won't you please forgive me? Please. (gentle violin music) (bell chimes) (gentle instrumental music) - Ivanushka. - Nastenka! (gentle instrumental music) - Ivanushka, how nice you are now. - Am I really? - I like you better. - My darling little Nastenka. You're right, you know. I used to be selfish. Now I do good deeds from morning till night. Yeah, see what a good man I've become. - Oh. There's something on your cheek. - Is there? - It's fur, a spot of brown hair like bear fur, I think. - Huh? - Oh, I was only joking, Ivanushka. - Nastenka. (fairy grunts) (cauldron bubbles) (sinister music) - Ah! (grunts) Disappear, image! Away, away! Get out of my sight, traitors, parasites! Get out! (owl hoots) What can we do, old owl, huh? (owl hoots) Ah! Let's try it, we might succeed. (teeth crunch) (mouth spits) (teeth crunch) (mouth spits) (teeth crunch) (mouth spits) (pots clang) - The other old women have stupid old men at home too, but you are the limit. Why did you have to drag your daughter into the forest? To amuse Grandfather Frost? To feed packs of hungry wolves? - Well, I-- - You, you, you! - I won't say it, I'll be quiet. - I can't help it, I miss Nastenka. I remember how I used to tie that big braid of hers. What a grand feeling! But I can't pull a thing anymore, now that Nastya's gone. You're almost bald. And if I pulled your beard it would come right off you! (spoon whacks) (Marphuska gasps) (Marphuska cries) (women grunt) (lips smack) Look, it's all your fault. I hit my darling daughter on her rosy cheek. I'd never have done it if Nastenka had been here. - [Ivan] Look who's here! (uptempo chiming music) (horses neigh) (uptempo chiming music) - I'd like you to meet Ivanushka, my fiance. Father, listen to me, I will explain everything. Grandfather Frost found me in the forest. First, he took me with him to his dwelling. He arranged the betrothal with Ivanushka. And then he gave me this dowry. (gentle music) - [Girl] Isn't the bridegroom handsome? - [Woman] And Nastenka looks just like a princess. - [Girl] No, like a queen! - Marphuska looks like a big sack of potatoes! Rotten potatoes! (women laugh) - All right, get out of here! Get out of here and never come back! All of you, get out of here! I'll show you! I'll show you who's a sack of potatoes! - Marphuska, now please don't get excited. - Get out of here, all of you! I want a fiance, I want precious stones! I want stones, stones! - [Narrator] So according to Marphuska's wishes and the old woman's orders, the old man took Marphuska into the heart of the forest and left her beneath the tall pine tree. (teeth crunch) - Ah. (teeth crunch) (teeth crunch) (milk splashes) (mouth swallows) (teeth crunch) Tell me, are you warm, little one? - Warm? Warm, he says. Can't you see my hands and feet are frozen? - Who is this freak of nature, hmm? (mystical chiming music) Once more, let me ask, are you warm, little girl? (teeth crunch) (palms slap) - Bring on my fiance, and my dowry too! A real big dowry and make it quick! (cymbals bang) (Father Frost groans) - Help! - Do you understand? (bandits sing in foreign language) (bandit sneezes) (bandits sing in foreign language) - Silence! Silence. To your stations. We're going to rob. (bandits grunt excitedly) Quiet! Here they come! (tense music) A ha! Grandmother has come to see us. - Hello, hello! - Ha, here she is, she hasn't bit the dust! (bandits laugh) - What little giants. Little bandits, darling bandits. Would you please help me? I'll reward you all. - With what? - With two tubs of gold nuggets and six pairs of sterling silver ingots, and all the copper I've got! - Ah! - Any amount! And all for easy work! - Ha, give it to us! (bandits shout) (bandits chatter) - That should hold them, copper's good enough for them. You will get gold! Ooh, not so fast, do the work first. - Huh, don't you trust us? - Oh, don't you trust me to trust you? Quiet now, listen, listen. (uptempo chiming music) (horses neigh) (uptempo chiming music) (dog barks) (uptempo chiming music) (horse hooves patter) Now, all right. You scoundrels, listen to what I'm asking you to do. It's fairly simple and easy. Soon, a boy and a girl are going to come by. Ivan, the widow's son, and Ivan's fiance. You must capture them, tie them up, and then torture them! Understand? - [Bandits] We understand. - Man your stations! (bandits mutter) (legs whoosh) (hands thud) (sleigh bells chime) (horse hooves patter) (bandit whistles) (bandits shout) - Ivanushka! - [Leader] Catch 'em, catch 'em! (cymbals bang) (men grunt) - Courage, Nastenka! (bandits shout) - [Bandit] Hold him! (men grunt) - That's how we do a job! - Ah! - [Nastenka] Ivanushka! (bandit laughs) - Very good. - All right, granny. Where's the gold? - Yes, right away, I have it here. (bandit laughs) Oh, ah, ooh, ah, ooh, ah! You robbed a little old lady! Your dirt ogre! (metal clangs) (Ivan grunts) (bandits grunt) Surrender, Ivan, or Nastenka will learn to sit on a shovel! (bandits grunt) - Come on, men! (cymbals clang) (cymbals clang) - Go on, get back up! You cowards! (cymbals clang) (fairy laughs) (cymbals clang) - Here I come, charge! (Ivan grunts) (fairy groans) My broom! I'm a witch and I can't move without it! (cymbals clang) (dog barks) (cymbals clang) (dog barks) - On your feet, hut! (bandits grunt) (clubs thud) Hey men, these are our old clubs coming down! (club thuds) (leader groans) (playful music) (clubs thud) (bandits groan) (fairy groans) (club thuds) (leader groans) (cymbals clang) (fairy grunts) (dog barks) - Ivanushka! (dog barks) - Nastenka! - Ivan, look out! - Ho, you old witch! - Oh, have pity on the poor grandmother of the wolfpack, oh! - We won't have the slightest pity for you! (dog barks) (fairy groans) (gentle music) - Ivanushka. - Nastenka. - Hmph. She got a trunk and jewels, a box of them, but you'll see. Marphuska will get two of each! Two trunks full of embroidery. And two jewel cases filled with precious stones. - Mm-hmm. - What do you mean by mm-hmm? She'll get four trunks and she'll get four jewel cases. - Mm-hmm. - Hmm, the man he found for Nastenka is a peasant, but Marphuska is sure to get a prince. You wait till she comes back. - Mm-hmm, mm-hmm. (sleigh bells chime) - Ah, here they are. (solemn instrumental music) (bells chime) (pigs oink) (pigs squeal) (bells chime) (pigs oink) Where's your dowry? - Here. - You idiot! (villagers gasp) (birds caw) (hand smacks) (Marphuska groans) (children laugh) There. (children laugh) (Marphuska cries) (villagers laugh) - Oh ho. - I won't say it, I'll be quiet. - Now, I'll give the orders! Ha! Let the wedding begin! (choir singing in foreign language) (uptempo orchestral music) - I attended the wedding. The bride and the bridegroom were radiant. They were the loveliest couple in the land, and nobody touched any water. And our story ends. (uptempo orchestral music)
