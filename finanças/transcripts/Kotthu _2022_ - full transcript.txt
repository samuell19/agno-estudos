Who cares about the fish when you're freezing! Argh! Stop, stop. What are you up to? Checking, what else! Where are you coming from, all drenched? We were fishing catfish in the rain with the guys. We got a great catch from the paddy fields. - So many fish! - And where's the fish? If you've a lot, share some with us too. We got rid of it there itself. He's going to the office. What's he gonna do with the fish? Shanu, if you're going to the office, don't take the straight road. Take right towards Manathara and go through the highway. They're having a programme at Chala. What programme? Not any political programme. A devotional worship or spiritual speech or something. Their committee is conducting it. So?! We've to go around an extra two kilometres for that?! I'm saying it for your own safety. So that you don't get into trouble cos of some miscreant's wrath. Like our wrath is any less dangerous! - Sumesh! - Yes, sir! They think they can scare us! Do one thing, you bleed dry these Tamilian lorry drivers! Let me take your leave. Red salute, comrade! Yeah! Suit yourself! Walk right into trouble! Anyway, you'll come to us to clean up your mess! Ugh! They're all talk! I bet they're scared of getting battered! He's not scared. But he also knows how things are. From his own experience. - I've also heard about it. - Sir, take a look at this. Let him go. Brr! Ah! Uff! - Alright, then. - Okay, my dear. Listen, sleep here tonight. It's quite late. Late?! It's not even 11 p.m. yet! Did you eat? I've made green pepper fish curry. I did, Ammini chechi. Okay, you carry on. Give me my food, Amma. Didn't you just eat five porottas and two plates of beef? You eat so much, yet it doesn't show on your body! Mom will be sad if I don't eat from here. Bye, Ammini chechi! Why can't he sleep here tonight? So late and it's pouring too! Why will he sleep alone in that party office? He can't sleep anywhere else. Just come with me. Get me some hot water, Ammini. 'What's up, man? Got any fish?' Did you keep the evening demonstration board upstairs? 'Yeah, what happened?' You scoundrel! Didn't I ask you to keep it in the godown? 'What's up with you? Have you gone insane?' Your father is the one who's insane! Hang up the phone and get lost or I'll smack your head! What a load of unnecessary tension! "O golden peacock!" "Bring forth- -" Oh, Dad, can you just come? I'll stop this and go, ok? I've work to do! Oh, no! "Bring forth Velappan, O golden peacock!" "Bring forth Velappan, O golden peacock!" O Murugan! If you're busy, you may leave, my son. It's just rice and curry. I can make it. You let me know if you'll be joining me for supper. Just call it lunch, Dad! People will think we got converted to high- class Brahmins! Son, Brahmins are a caste not a religion that one can convert to. One becomes a Brahmin by karma and not by birth. Haven't you heard this dialogue in movies before? Haven't you? Have you? Stop talking so weirdly, Dad! It's so annoying listening to you. It's embarrassing! What sort of language is this! Are you going to be there for lunch or not? Just tell me that. Didn't I tell you, I've got catering today? I'll eat from there. Then one glass of rice would suffice. I think you've gone completely cuckoo in the head from constantly roaming around these temples! I caught so much fish yesterday. But you won't let me bring it home, no! Never! Especially since we've a temple at home. You call this a temple?! Pasting pictures from magazines on walls won't make it a temple! Nevertheless, you can feel God's presence! Dad! You make me want to break my head on this wall! - Aji... - Yeah. Where are you? Hey buddy! Are you not ready yet? I was helping out Mr. Brahmin, my lad! Of course, you should. Purushu etta, how you? All good? No grievances as such, lad. He means he's doing okay. Just a refined version. Come on, let's go. Come. Cool drinks! Cool drinks! Have some cool drinks! Welcome, welcome! - I want some. - Now? Are you crazy? Let her drink and come. - Have some cool drinks! - Come on. What will you have? How about a fuljar soda? Hmm... fuljar soda... No! It'll mess up the makeup. Do you've shaken lemonade? Then, I'll get you a special shaken lemonade. - Shanu... - Yes. Just fix that, okay? A special shaken lemonade for our bride. In a minute! He's our event manager and master of shaken lemonades. Here you go. Did you learn this by practice? Nope, I did a six months course at Annamalai University to learn it. Are you interested? Oh, don't rush, drink slow! How's it? It's amazing. We've got lots of other amazing stuff. Drink up, I'll show you our food counter. 'KOYAKKA'S CHICKEN STALL' 'UMMACHI'S (MOM'S) KITCHEN' - Peace be upon you. - Peace be upon you too. - Peace be upon you. - Peace be upon you too. Come. Come on. - Alright. - Don't leave right away, okay. Everything is set, okay. All the best. Thank you. Who's that? He's our events guy. - Eve...what? - We install the pavilions. These are my dad's sister, my mother's older sister and my brother's wife. You all look familiar to me. Really?! Alright, then. Tell me if you need some- - Sorry, sorry, I didn't see you! Sorry?! Idiot! Darn! Ruined my mood, ugh! What's the catering guy doing on the stage! Excuse me. Madam, can you please stand closer to him? Hello?! What's this?! Why ask her? You could tell me, no? No, bro, just wanted a good frame... What frame! Are you shooting a movie?! Sorry, bro. Sorry. - Did he just swear at me? - What? That scoundrel was swearing at me just now. Didn't you hear? - No, I didn't hear. - You didn't hear?! But I heard! Hey, enough! Stop this! Danny, avoid the flash and click. Okay, okay. I mean enough of your photography! Then go and cover the event outside. They needed it, arrogant fellows! Here's chicken 65. Does this food smell of kerosene? Doesn't it? - Kerosene smell, no? - No. Yes, yes, it does. It really does. I really feel it. For real! No one else complained. Aha! Your food seems fine, so it's just mine then? What's wrong, brother? We used a bit of sauce in the Chinese dishes. Everything else is organic. Is kerosene organic? Kerosene?! I'm done. Hey, man! There's kerosene in this food! No one else has any complaints. Only you do, brother. Hey! There's no kerosene smell, it's fine. Now I've to eat what you smelled, huh?! So, the kerosene issue is over?! Now it's me smelling the food? What's with you? Are you mad? - You idiot! - Stop it, bro! Sit down! - SIT! Sit there, you! - Brother- in- law... - EAT THE FOOD! - What's wrong? The food smells like kerosene, man! - Where's the smell? - Everyone said so! All these people ate it, no one had a problem! I don't have any problem, he's the one! What's wrong? Sumesh! - What?! - Let it go, man! Don't create a scene! - Stop it! - What a shame! How dare you talk like that! You swine! I'll beat the crap out of you! - Let it go! - Calm down! He says the food smells of kerosene! - What the hell are you doing? - He's crazy! - Calm down, man! - He's wasting food! 'Don't you dare shove your filthy arrogance on me!' 'What?! What's it, huh?!' 'I dare you! Come on, man!' 'What?! You won't do a thing!' 'Who are you scared of, huh?' If the bride refuses to go with groom after the marriage and reception... How can it be justified? Ask if their daughter has any psychological problems. But our daughter says the groom has some psychological issues. She's a post- graduate in Psychology. And she practices 'how to dump someone 101'! 'I won't tolerate cheating!' 'You fixed the alliance in front of the townsmen and family.' 'You had no qualms about accepting my mahr!' 'And then one day, you just decide... Oh! Not you, your daughter!' 'Are we all supposed to dance to her tune?' - 'What a shitshow!' - What's up? You didn't go? Broken up! Why?! Ah, you go. The marriage has been registered. Even if she wants a divorce, it'll be Yusuf's call now. I won't give her the damn divorce! Yes? Master had asked me to come to settle the catering bill. What?! He's here for the catering money. Don't give them a single penny. Bunch of scamsters! What scam, brother? Nothing. You go now and come back in the evening. It's fine if you pay me later. But why is he talking rubbish? My dear son... The whole marriage is on the verge of a breakup. Let us settle that first. There's nothing left to settle! She'll come with me and I'll take her home. But these guys! These pigs who mixed kerosene in the food shouldn't be paid a single penny! No need, man! I know how to get it! You wanna see? Go and get it from your father! You Idiot! How dare you talk about my father! You don't know who I am! My father didn't die of old age or arthritis! Don't stir up trouble, Shanu! Take him away if you don't want trouble! If you dare, come out and try me! - I'll be here! - Go on, Shanu! - Come later! - Get lost, you dog! Oh, God! What a psycho! 'No religious person will support you in this case.' 'They won't be able to!' 'It's only fair.' So, master, please convince your daughter. How can I... One minute, please... Hello. Okay. It's one of her friends, couldn't come for the reception it seems. - Who's this? - What do I tell her, Usthad? Hello, Shanu here... From Kairali Events. - I was at your house just now... - Ah! Why are you calling me? You didn't get your payment, no? Give some discount, okay? My father just lost a ton of money! - That's why I called you. He's crazy! '- Yes, he is!' He deserves a good beating! Don't give in, okay? Feel free to call us if there's any issue. Note down my number. O my mother! Seems like you're a big shot! I'm not kidding. We're not just catering guys. We're political party workers. - I'm an LC member. - What's an LC member? Are you joking? I'm serious. Hello. Can you hear me? Yes, I can. Tell me. Hello, Hizu... Nothing, I just wanted to talk to you. Are you busy? Busy... No. Not that busy. I've got to go in for work. Have you got catering today? No, going to give a quotation for an event. Okay, then we'll speak later. You're off to do something important. So, all the best for that! "Your words, like drops of honey" "Took me into a world of enchantment" "On my mind and in my heart" "You appeared like a dream, only to fade away" "My days are spent in pursuit of your vision" "The night jasmine softly whispers to the moon" "As dawn breaks, their secrets blossom into flowers" "Forsaking its branches, the spring" "Hurried towards the twigs of summer" "A gentle fragrance wafted through my heart" "Desire relinquished the reins of its chariot" "In my heart like a moonlight caress" "Lending beauty to everything around" "Like a lyric dissolving into music" "You became the song of my life" "Your every gaze burns like a lightning" "Did you ever know?" "The night jasmine softly whispers to the moon" "As dawn breaks, their secrets blossom into flowers" "Forsaking its branches, the spring" "Hurried towards the twigs of summer" "A gentle fragrance wafted through my heart" Wow, superb! You've lost again! You wanna play again?! Have you no shame or dignity? Thottamvalappil Aji is shameless, man! You play! When you've lost eight times, there's no turning back. Now comes the real fight! Wait and watch! Come on, play! Ask her if she wants us to beat him up? I've slapped him once. If he keeps pestering, we might've to give him a good thrashing. Tell her we don't mind doing it. - Give me, I'll type. - Go away! Sadettan is here! - Did you get wet in the rain, Sadetta? - No, man. Did you get bored? Nope. We were playing here. Aha! - And who lost? - Him, as always. His life continues to be an open book of defeats! Sadetta, he pockets the red perfectly, but never the follower. Why is it so hard for you to pocket a follower, Aji? Seemed like a waste of time... Aji, pay attention. We must have an aim. I'll pocket this coin! You must have that confidence. Only then will it pass through your fingers. Look here. I've pocketed the red. Next, a follower, right? Watch. And there goes the follower! Want another follower? Okay, watch. A follower! Don't limit it to just one. You want more followers? Followers! Followers! Whoa! Followers! Want more? Eh? I keep telling you, no? To at least have some aim! - Then you come and play. - Set it up. Do you know what's great about playing with me? You can be proud of defeating a valiant player! Pfft, the pride of defeating a constant failure! Hand me the striker, O valiant guy! Just play like how he showed you. It's all about hand-eye coordination. From the eye to the hand to the striker! That's the technique. Darn, who knew! What do you want? Followers? Here you go! Do you want more followers? Here! Getting dusty, isn't it? This June 19th is Nagendran's martyrdom day. If it wasn't for him, it would have been my martyrdom day. It was on a rainy day like this that we brought Nagendran's body home. The ambulance's tire got stuck in the mud on the way to his house up on the hill. We tried everything but we couldn't get the vehicle out. And didn't we carry his body... for a mile? Well, can't call it a body. A kit containing 85 kilos of flesh and bones, that was butchered by them and later sewn up together by the doctors. That's what we carried! What's the matter, Sadetta? Shouldn't we finish off that Kanakan? Shouldn't we? The fake accused they produced in court has been released after the remand period. The real culprit, Kanakan is out of the picture, hidden from our sight. I don't see that case going to trial or a conviction happening in the near future. We lost one among us. That's all. Right after the incident, that pig just vanished, Sadetta. Our informers will let us know once he sets foot back home. Really?! And did you get to know anything?! Informers, my foot! He has been here for the last two weeks, you losers! Where's he now? Just tell us what we need to do, Sadetta. If you ask me where he is, even I don't know. Well, what's the point even if I do. Of course, he'll be under the protection of their party. But if you want... you can get him alone tonight. Just a guess. In fact, not a guess, I'm sure! It has been pouring for three or four days now. When it rains, catfishes come into the paddy fields near his place. Even if his father is dying, he won't miss an opportunity to catch those fishes! He'll definitely get out to lay a fish trap. Just give it a try. I'm okay. Are you guys ready? We can definitely screw him over. But Sadetta, can I say something? Hmm? Don't feel bad. Is it necessary to kill him? Can't we just chop off his hand or leg? Is that enough? If you guys think that'll do... so be it. Hand and leg! That'll do! They shouldn't think we've been cornered in fear. That's all I care about. Dad, a call for you. You come here. Let Grandpa take the call. Are you sleepy? 'What have you decided to do with him, Sadanandan?' 'Eh?' KP, if we begin to strike each other out as part of revenge killing, won't we have to start from way back? 'If that is where we need to start, start from there.' Those guys are not contract killers! 'How's this contract killing?' 'Isn't this our resistance?' It's not like I don't know that. You hang up. Give me some time to think. Yes, Sadetta. Tell me. You come over to my place. What's the matter, Sadetta? You just come. Alright. The cries of Nagendran's wife and children still ring in my mind. None of them will understand the pain of losing family to the strike of a knife. But you will! You've experienced it. Sadetta, just tell me what to do. Hmm... Well... Shanu... Isn't it easier to finish him off rather than go for his hand or leg? Isn't it? Yes. Then finish him off. We need to walk towards that end. He has laid the fish trap at the eastern end. Is the information correct? It's correct. Our nightingale, Shibu will never cheat on betrayal! What beautiful scenery, right? We're not going on a picnic, we're going to beat someone up. Just to beat up, not to kill, right? Stop blabbering and keep walking! Hope that pig is there! Shanu! He came onto the knife! You pig! Come on, man! Will the schools will be closed today? Why are you at the hospital now? It's not like they're doing an emergency treatment on him. They're conducting a post- mortem! You go to his house. Gopal ji, get in the car. Let's go there. Brother, is today a school holiday? Get lost, man! 'Kannur's eternal wounds: RGP activist murdered.' Where's she? She's upstairs. - Let's sit here, Yousef. - She's upstairs, right? Then why should I sit here? Oh, dear! Psycho is here! Hey! Hey! Open the door! I said open the door! I'm your husband and I'm asking you to! Husband?! On what basis? I'm your lawfully wedded husband as long as my nikah and mahr are valid. You fixed the nikah with my dad, right? And the mahr is in his locker. So go and ask him. Your arguments won't hold up in any court or Mahal! 'You get out of that room and talk to me face to face!' Your father is not listening to me. You just go upstairs and check. Nobody needs to go. She doesn't have to be so stubborn! No use telling you! Ajmal... where's he? I'll kill you! Open, you... Who's calling you? Who's that? Your dope father! Are you deaf? Tell me, who's calling you? Are you deaf?! I said, your dope father! - How dare you insult my father! Huh? - Brother- in- law... Your car is parked in the middle of the road. Can you move it? The road is blocked. Which dog has parked his car like this and blocked the road? HUH? Who's it? Keep honking! I'm gonna set fire to this damn car! Who's got a problem, huh? Are you off to make a death announcement? You pig! How dare you! - WHAT, HUH? - YOU- - Sajith, stop it. Hey, friend, move your car. We are, in fact, on the way to announce a death. Our brother has died. In fact, he didn't die, he was killed. Do I need to explain more? Now move your car! Move it, man! Do it fast. I should break his stupid head! Arrogant rascal is creating a scene! Rameshan, let's go. And so, for the first time in my life, I abused someone's father. Great! Where does he keep disappearing off to? Hey, this will get over now. Okay, then you hang up. A hundred red revolutionary kisses to you. That call was regarding a catering order. I said can't do. How's the jackfruit, Sadetta? No doubt, it's delicious. But you keep it back inside. Else, I won't be able to stop eating it. - Have one more. - Oh, no thanks. It's gassy. You can take it. - Do you want it? - Nah, I don't want. I haven't told Mom that we are the culprits. I only told her that we're hiding out to avoid an arrest on suspicion. What's the word outside, Sadetta? The police aren't saying anything specific on the news. Do they know it is us? Let the police investigate. Give them some time. Why this hurry? Even if they investigate and find out, I know how to protect my children. Don't venture out away from our area. Don't go for any second show. Also, don't stay in one place permanently. Go to Aji's house tomorrow. Ah, except for my annoying father, it's extremely safe there! Have no fear. Just call me if you need anything. Is it safe to call you on your number? How else will you call me? By calling on your grandma's phone?! Of course, you can call me! What's the cyber cell going to do? Even if they do, let them! That's true. I'm with you no matter what! The funeral procession carrying the mortal remains of the heavenly martyr, Kanakaraj is underway through these streets. Red terrorism can never bury the spirit of this land's beloved son. The brave and heroic son of Mother India... Die... you... Idiot... piece of shit! Check this out, man. 'Die you cow dung pest!' Write like that. Get lost you idiot, isn't that the best? No, that's not good. This group is called 'Che Guevara, the fighter'. - Need to maintain a standard. - That group is your account? Yes, I'm also 'Che Guevara' and 'Fidel Castro'! And that Sudarshanam group, where they only talk nonsense, that is also mine. Oh, dear! How many times have I cussed your father in that?! But it wasn't specifically directed at his dad, no? Is your father crazy? Why is he refilling the oil in the lamp at midnight?! - What can I say! - 'O Velmuruga!' Eternal lamp, it seems, ugh! He uses up one, one and a half litres of oil every day! He keeps waking up to refill it. No sleep, man! I can tolerate all that! But it's when he rings that bell! Argh! Lie down quietly, children. As you wish, milord! Don't make fun of your dad, man! Save me, my God, Murugan! The Lord of Palani! Hey, is this okay? This is enough for Che Guevara. Now go to Fidel Castro's page. Hey! Hey! Sounds like trouble! Hey! What was that? They're running away! Catch them! They're leaving, man! Stop them! - Hey, you! - Stop there! Who's there?! You Scoundrels! - Face us if you dare! - Come on, you pigs! Aji... - Hey, be careful! - Shanu... It is steel, man! Where did those pigs go?! Why did you go to the toilet in between?! Hey, don't push me! This contains you know what! - If it drops, we're done! - Show me! They've reached the next district! Haven't you slept yet, children? Go and sleep, Dad! Stop driving me nuts! I said, go back inside! They want to burst firecrackers at this time of the night... Why are you yelling at him? Poor soul! Poor soul, my foot! He drives me crazy. He must've thought they burst a cracker at the temple. Let me put this back. What do you think? Was that a Yamaha bike? First you call Sadettan. They were trying to scare us. If it was to finish you all, they would've aimed at the house. O, Lord! Maybe they missed the aim, Sadetta. You think they're amateurs, Sumesh? Anyway, we won't react now. Let's wait and see. Let's see if it's settled with this. 'Hello, Shanu, where are you?' Hizu, I'll call you back after some time. No, it's urgent. I'm in the middle of an urgency too! I'll call you back. Tell me, Sadetta. What should we do? What? The bomb! Which bomb? The bomb was blasted yesterday, no? Tell me what's your problem right now? Look, it's ringing again. No, I cut the call. Why do you keep cutting the call? Who keeps calling you like this? That is... this... um... - Any catering order? - Yeah. Stop playing around and tell him the truth. Sadetta, it's the girl I told you about. You told him?! My chest feels heavy if I keep such things to myself. It's ringing again. Don't cut the call. No, I'm just silencing it. Why is she calling you over and over again? There's some small issue in her house. Not a small issue. It's pretty big, Sadetta. Her family is trying to send her off with that other guy. You mean with that crazy guy? You dog, you told him everything?! The heaviness in my chest, man! Uff! That... - Sa- - - Answer that call and talk to her. Looks like the problem is quite serious today. You speak to her. Tell me, Hizu... You don't need to hang up! I'll only do it after I tell you this. Yousef's here with his people to take me to his house. If you can, do something. If not, just get lost! Usthad, I'm not happy sending her off with him. It's only because you're all compelling me to... Hamsa master, don't talk like that anymore. This is what's right in God's eyes. Even if she wants a divorce, she can only ask for it after living with him. So, first let her live with him. Will think about the rest later. Isn't that right? What's up? Are you ready? Listen, they're calling you. Are they done lecturing Dad? I was waiting for that to get over. You just ignore it. That's their nature. Come. It's your life. Exactly! It is 'my life.' A few days at her husband's house and all her issues will disappear! Am I right? Turn the car around. What's the matter, Sadanandan? Master, don't you know him? He's with the party. What brings you here? You never tell us anything. But, since there's an issue, we have to come, right? There's no need for the party workers to interfere in this problem. The Mahal Committee and our people are enough to solve this. And were you able to solve it? Yes, everything is resolved. The bride is about to leave with the groom. That means the problem has only started. What you are imposing now is the will of the groom. But the party and the girl have a different stand on this issue. Who's the groom? That will be me. This girl is not interested to come with you. Sadetta, that's what she said before. But not anymore. See, she's all ready to go. But you're the one who's saying it. Well, it's true. She's ready to go. But not with him. She's going with my boy. Shanu... With him! They are in love. So, let them live together. Who the hell are you to decide that? Your jackass grandfather! Sounds familiar? Muthukoya... Teach this moron... not about me, but what our party is about! What is this? Rowdyism?! This is not rowdyism, it's Communism. And what you did is deplorable! We won't tolerate that. Ajmal... If you and your brother have any financial dealings with him, you should settle it by doing business. Instead, don't pimp out your sister to this nasty lunatic, who no woman in this world would even consider! HEY! Beware! I'll beat the shit out of you! Don't try me! What's going on here? I've told Mom pretty much everything. The rest, can I call you later and tell? That means, you're really going? Shanu has come to take me with him. We know each other. Kairali events, catering. Hey... How was I out there? Was I over the top? Not at all. I thought you would smack that nutcase on his face- - They've already received a complaint. Even if I answer the phone or not, it's gonna be a problem. Tell me, comrade. 'Sadanandan, what the hell have you and your boys done?' 'Have you kidnapped some Master's daughter?' - We are not kidnapping anyone, KP. '- Then?' A bunch of fanatics and family members were forcefully sending off an innocent girl with a psycho. So, we went and rescued her. 'And is this how you do it?!' I didn't ask her to leave her house. Instead, she left on her own will with the man she loves. 'But all the blame will fall on the party, right?' KP, nothing like that will happen. Leave it to me. I'll handle this. Nobody will blame the party. 'Easy for you to say.' 'Don't forget that the panchayat election is coming up!' Political activities exist beyond election strategies, right, KP? Our generation may not be able to carry out great struggles like Kayyur or Karivallur. So, if we won't do things like this once in a while, we might forget the word 'revolution', no? 'You have lost it.' 'I'm going in for a meeting.' Will call you later. Sometimes... some of our leaders.. are just so thick! Sumesh, what were you saying? What should I've done to him? That comment has lost its charm now. But what you told over the phone just now. That was an amazing punch dialogue! Be quiet, okay. Yes, I'm coming. Hang up the call. Sumesh, carry on. What was the punch dialogue? Oh, I've nothing more to say. So where are you taking the bride and groom? To your house. Stop kidding, Sadetta. I mean it. We're taking them to your house. Any objection? - Hey... - What objection?! That's awesome! Shanu... I made some arrangements in the little time I had. If you'd told us a few days earlier, we could've arranged a big celebration! - Right, Sumesh? - Of course! Now, you make the most with this! I need to go somewhere urgently. Sadetta, just come in and go. No, I'll come later. It's urgent that's why. Start the car. You guys carry on. Welcome to my house! And just like that Hizana has upgraded from a hut to a castle! Lucky girl! Even I've a castle. Except it's abandoned now. We'll slowly set it up and shift there. What are you waiting for? Come inside. Come. Finally, my mom became a mother- in- law! Right, Shanu? Get lost! Come inside, dear. Come on. "First comes, the wedding" "This is a sacred thread, essential for my long life" - The priest is here! - O Ambika, Saraswathi, Bhadra... He's taking random women's names! Instead proclaim some slogans and invite the newlyweds in! Long live the revolution! - Come inside. - Long live the revolution! - Long live the revolution! - Long live the revolution! What you're saying is not possible. One of them got married today. We've also received a complaint regarding that marriage. That's not a problem, we can keep it on hold. But it has been so many days since the murder. Remember it's your party governing the state now. These guys have toiled and put their lives on the line to enable the party to have ministers and a Government! And the party is well aware of the justice and injustice it entails. You speak for yourself! That's why I said... You'll anyway have to give us a culprit. The earlier that is done and if you give us at least one real culprit, we'll be able to wipe away the ill- repute that the police abet your crimes. Also... instead of the culprits surrendering in court, if we're able to record an arrest, it will bring honour to the Government and to us. You need to lock up my kids to bring you honour, huh? Not bad. You really are such a pig! Good! Very good! What's wrong with him? Did your laughter chord break? Laughter has a chord?! You just sit here and laugh. A real man just got married and is in your house right now! When are you gonna get married? When you become long in the tooth? How does one's tooth become long?! What nonsense is he saying, man?! Aji, what kind of toothbrush do you use for long tooth?! He has lost it, man. Leave it. No, no. Don't leave it yet. Let's do one thing. You... No! No! Not you! You find a girl for me. I'll fall in love. Who am I? A broker? What?! Broker Aji! Take this away from here. Broker! Broker Aji! Broker... Take it, take it! Or this scamp will die from laughter. No, no. Just one more. - Until Shanu comes. Pour one more. - Enough, man. Broker Aji, pour me one! I called my dad while you were in the shower. And? He said he has nothing to say and hung up. "I've nothing to say, it was awesome!" - In that sense? - No. "I've nothing to say, you idiot, hang up and get lost!" In that sense! That sounds more appropriate. - Other one didn't sync with the situation. - Not funny. The Mahal Committee said they would even deny burial ground. We'll fix everything. You go shower and freshen up. I'll go check on the guys and be back. All okay, no? Eh? All okay? '?... your warm kisses- - " Shut up, you brat! Don't, Ammini chechi! Don't hit him. Let him sing. It's fine if he drinks but what will people say if he howls like this? After all, it is a wedding, not someone's death! His song! Do you know who this is? Shreya Ghoshal! - Get lost! - She sings really well! Oh, no! Sadettan is here. Why are you behaving like a child, Ammini chechi? You know what, Sadetta, in her ration card, her name is Kunjammini which means baby Ammini. - How much has he had to drink? - Only three pegs. Just three?! Sumesh, come with me. Let's step outside for a minute. I'll sing for you once I'm back. I'll give you one! Go! Stop acting silly! Walk steady... Some of our leaders are doves of peace, it seems. But I don't believe in that. You know CI Aliyar and SI Chandran, if this case goes out of their hands, it will affect us badly. They want us to surrender a culprit as soon as possible. It's alright, Sadetta. I'm ready to go. Are you insane? You just took a girl out of her house and into your life! Is this a joke to you? - I'm free. - You stop talking. Sadetta, I'm going to say something. Please take it in the right sense. All of them have been in jail except me. When they brag about their experiences in Kannur jail, I never have anything to say. So, this time, give me a chance. I'll go. Sadetta, don't take him seriously. He's drunk. Where's this courage coming from? The three pegs in your stomach? Because I really want to do it, Sadetta. Please, let me go. - So, you have no sisters? - Nobody else. - Are you the only daughter? - Yeah. Be seated. Play two more rounds and go. Yeah, sure. All good, dear? Have no fear, okay? Ammini chechi... Sumesh is coming with me. He'll be back only after a few days. Shreya Ghoshal is staring at me. Sadetta, let me accompany you till there. No need. You guys come here. The police will be here soon. Maybe, you can make it look like you are trying to escape. But don't overdo it. Okay. You will be taken to the CI's office. They'll write a weak FIR that we can easily quash in the court. Have no fear. I don't have any fear, Sadetta. It's alright. So, I'm off then. I'll come see you with the lawyer tomorrow. I'll pay for the tea. Jayan... 'Twenty rupees.' Twenty. Okay, then. See you. Catch him. Catch! Catch! Don't let go of him. - Get him into the jeep. - Hold him. Stop tickling me! - Leave me! - Get him inside the jeep. - What's wrong, sir? - Don't leave him. He is the accused in Kanakarajan murder case. - Move, man! - Catch him, don't let him go. - You killed our Kanakan! - Stop! Move! You think we'll let you go after murdering Kanakan?! - You idiot! - Will see you when you come out! - Hey! - Hey! I'll chop you into pieces! Don't you dare mess with me! Don't you dare! I'll finish you! What, huh?! - Why are you staring at me?! HUH? - Come on! You don't know what I'm capable of! I'll butcher you! Get inside the jeep! I am getting in. Why are you pushing? Move over! Why are you sitting here like this? That girl is alone over there. Go inside. After some time, Ammini chechi. I'll give you one. What are you doing here? Go on, man. She's not in a good condition either. What about you guys? Are you going home? If not, sleep here. If you've got a mat, lay it out on the veranda. We'll sleep when it's time. Will they give him a mat to sleep at the police station? Jeez! It's not like what you think, Ammini chechi. I'll leave the mat and blanket outside. There was amazing food at the wedding. I didn't have it cos you required me for this. How's the chicken curry? Not bad. Did you eat? No, will eat after you do. I'll take time, okay. You've to chew your food properly, only then it'll be absorbed by the body. Hey! Give us one more name, someone who was with you that day. Not to add as an accused but as a witness. No need of that, sir. A quarrel that broke out while fishing. A killing committed in self-defence. That's it, nothing more! Didn't Sadettan tell you? What's with these games now? - Why? - Nothing. You write what we first decided. The problem is that any sensible Magistrate will know it's fake... ...as soon as he reads it. This is the biggest issue with you police. You'll step on us the minute we bow down a little! You slowly finish it up. I'll be at the quarters. Shall I tell you the truth? You might not believe me. To be honest, we had no plans to kill Kanakan. - Then? - Then what! He came begging for it. It was actually Shanu who stabbed him, right? Sir, don't try to play police, okay? Shanu, it seems! You couldn't find anyone else? He wasn't even in town that day. He's all talk anyway. He's super scared of killing and shit! Stuff yourself! Shanu, imagine! Hello? Over here! This is our nuptial night, okay! No jasmine flowers but there's milk. Why do you look so dreary? Did you feel so? Was it just my feeling? Then leave it. No, you're right. They took Sumesh away, right. That's the reason. After that, Ammini Chechi is also very gloomy. Is that Sadettan your godfather? He is not bad. But something seems off... I find your friends and everything else so mysterious. Nothing like that. Have you heard of blood relations? Who hasn't?! Not the conventional one. This blood relationship is related to actual blood. A pukka blood relation! Why are all my grooms psychos, oh, God! I'm not a psycho or anything! Come, let's sleep. Listen... Are you in the mood for a flashback right now? Why not! I've only told you bits and pieces about my family, never the whole story. Not just to you... I have never told anyone. My father was not into any party or politics. He was a poor merchant. Mother, as you know, like in every home, was a typical mother. Her life revolved around her kitchen, utensils, prayer, etc. Then, three sisters, one after the other, like the beads of a 'tasbih'. And me, the youngest among them. Maybe cos they finally got a son after having three daughters, my Valyuppa took me to Nilambur saying, 'We should raise him well". Valyuppa as in, my mother's dad. It was while I was studying in dars there, when Valyuppa passed away. After getting the news of his death, father was about to leave for Nilambur with my mother and sisters. That's when Balan master came. Balan master was a well- known, formidable political leader in those times. He was a good friend of my father's. How are you going to manage going so far with these kids? It'll take you forever to reach Nilambur. Do one thing. Take my car and go. Most party members here are alive only because the opposition parties never got a favourable opportunity to kill them. They thought they finally got Balan master in their hands away from the shield of the party's power centres. Except, it wasn't Balan master they got... but his car... and Hameed from Maadayi, who didn't even know who Karl Marx was, and his wife and three children. My entire family was burnt to ashes... I was overjoyed to see the sudden flurry of people at my mother's house. Comrades, including Balan master came to pick me up from Payyanur. Among them was a man with a powerful voice and a strong face. The one you mentioned earlier, our Godfather, Sadettan! Shall we go to Kannur? I came here sitting on Sadettan's shoulder. That day I felt like it was the first time I saw the world from such a height. There were a lot of people. And amongst them five coffins floated past. My child... Do you know whose corpses they're carrying? They are your father... mother... and sisters. They were murdered by some idiots. This is your family's funeral procession. My mother's family wanted to take me back to Nilambur. Son, shall we go? He belongs here. He's got his uncles and us here, right? He'll stay here. Have you heard of that movie in which a wolf raises a boy? Likewise... This groom of yours was raised by the Communist Party. Chandran sir... I've a doubt. I've heard that you can figure out who the culprit is by looking at the style of the strike. How do you do that? So that once you learn it, you can change your style, huh? Shut your face! This is our discussion. Tell me, Chandran sir. What is the difference between our strike and theirs? The main difference is... they know exactly where to strike to incapacitate someone and where to strike to finish them off. Since they do it with practice, they know exactly where and when to strike. You guys strike repeatedly, all over, it's embarrassing! Sir. Sir. - Where's the SI? - He's upstairs, sir. They're interrogating an IPC 302 accused. Sir, ASP Nitheesh Mishra sir is here. Eh?! Why is he coming here now? Chandran sir, are we screwed? If there's any problem, we can call Sadettan. Shut up. Sir. Is he the accused in Kanakaraj murder case? Yes, sir. We brought him for questioning under Aliyar sir's monitoring. The first accused? There's only one accused, sir. Oh! Have you already decided? That there's only one culprit? Did you kill Kanakaraj alone? Hello, sir! Did you kill Kanakaraj alone, sir? I've told him everything. Oh! So, you won't tell me, huh?! Then, you ask him in front of me. What was the motive? How did the killing take place? The short story you wrote in this charge sheet, right? Ask him to repeat it to me without making any mistakes. Sir... Sir, you know that we've a certain procedure as to how we handle the political cases here. Why does only the police here have different procedures and laws? Isn't Kannur part of India? Hey you... Which leader asked you to kill Kanakaraj? How many of you were there? Why did you kill him? Tell me everything. Chandran sir... Do you remember what Sadettan told you? Remember you'll have to live here for the rest of your life! If this outsider acts too smart, you're gonna suffer! You dare school the police, huh? Hey, you! Enough, sir. Get up. Sir! Chandran sir... You're going to get in trouble for this! What trouble, huh?! It's not your party who pay our salaries! If you can finish me in one go... do it and then leave! What's wrong with killing you slowly?! You won't die that easily. Never! I know exactly what will happen to this case as well. Nothing will happen. At the end of the remand period, he will get off scot-free! They'll kill again on their leaders' order. And you'll still be there to help them, right? I've got one and a half years of service left, after which, my family and I'll have to continue living in this town. At least for the remaining one and a half years, do the work of a real policeman, sir! Don't start eating your own feces now to become a dog in your next birth, sir. I didn't come here hoping to fix everything. But I intend to fix at least one of them. Sumesh... - Do you want water? - Get lost! The accused in the much publicised Kanakarajan murder case was arrested by the investigation team last night. The accused will be taken to court shortly. We are live from the police station. Local people and the media have gathered here. Sumesh, who was arrested in the case, is an ICPM activist but the police have not yet received any evidence that suggests a political conspiracy. Listen to me, KP. Stop preaching to me like you do in your public meetings. No comments! No comments! I said, no comments! I've nothing to say! Move away! That North Indian beat up my guy, who had surrendered because I asked him to! You just need to sit there and not be bothered, right! Hang up, KP! Don't embarrass yourself! What happened, Sadetta? Did you see him? Yes, I did. Is he even capable of facing Kanakan alone? They're playing us. It's not like we don't know that they're in cahoots with the police! Let's see how far it goes! (Babble of voices) Sumesh... Sumesh... Do you have anything to say? Was it you who killed Kanakaraj? - Were you tortured in police custody? - Keep moving. Did you kill Kanakaraj alone? Don't let anyone come close. - Block everyone. - Sumesh... - No one should come through. - Hey, Sumesh... Sumesh... Sumesh... Here! Here! Keep everyone away! Keep walking. - Sumesh! - Walk! How are you? - I'm alright. - Get in. - Are you okay? - Get inside the jeep, I said. - Long live the revolution! - Get in! - Why are you pushing me, sir! - Move over. Get going. Long live the revolution! Wait, don't go. Need to buy groceries. Here's the list. What more is left to buy?! Didn't you buy a ton of items including toilet brush, just yesterday? That's how households work. Here you go... Gosh! Should've stayed at Ammini chechi's house itself. You've written a long statement, Hizu! What is this 'russet potato'?! Why? Have you not heard of it? Normal potatoes! That's enough! Come back soon, okay? No. I need to go to the jail to see Sumesh. Will you buy chapati and chicken from the jail like last time? Then, I can skip cooking. I'll see. Go inside and rest! Oh, dear! I always thought you simply bragged about riding the bike at full throttle! But this is lightning speed, man! Stop pulling my leg, man! Anyone would say the same thing! How long has it been since your wedding? How long have you been in prison? That long! Did you inform Hizana's family? Usually, once the girl gets pregnant, they tend to forgive elopements! No way! It's exactly opposite in our case. Her family hoped that she would fail, go back home and remarry. That didn't happen, right? They are still mad at us. This is why I told you... Why did you've to shift to your old house? You could've stayed with my mother. Sadettan asked me to shift so that we don't burden your mother. I don't think that it was for my mother. Maybe Sadettan didn't want to spoil your honeymoon. My Ammini would be like the third wheel! Well, at least the shifting has been fruitful! That too within a month and a half- - Can you just stop your stupid giggling?! What's so unusual about it? You... tell me how are things here? What to tell? This is my empire. Sometimes they put rape case culprits in my cell... Disciplinary teaching, it seems! Sir, have some sweets. My friend's going to be a dad. It's his treat. Stop this nonsense, man! Hey, you! Make it fast and go back! Here to kill me with laddus and diabetes! Listen? Didn't you get yellow laddus? Will get some for the next pregnancy, okay? What the! I'll break your head! Enough! Time's up! Shall I go? Alright. This isn't very clear. That's okay, it's clear to the doctor. Give it back to me. Did you see Sumesh after that? Yeah, a couple of times. He shouldn't be the one in there. Hey! Hey! Suresh! Suresh! You stupid! We shouldn't let him go! Let's chase him down? Are you crazy?! He must've gone so far! Leave that to me. I'll catch him if I have to! You know me! Can't drive rashly like that, you dog! She's with us, right! She is in the car, that's why... Otherwise, you think we would let him off! Start the car. I don't think the driver did that accidentally. The vehicle was of Kannur registration. You drive carefully. Keep to the side. "Pelting raindrops piercing through" "O heart, have you forgotten how to beat?" "Gleaming stars in the night sky" "O time, was that a bolt of lightning in the rainstorm?" "Under a melancholic shadow of a cloud" "The rain devours us together" "Like waves in the ocean, as one falls back in" "The next one crashes on the shore" "Covered in red since birth!" "Stained in blood for life!" "Yesterday's songs are tinted with a whiff of the new rain" "As one, we tore across the blazing red path" "Like the wandering wind" "We'll soar together, hand in hand" "Smiles that don't fade away even if we fall and crash " "Now that spring has withered" "Come summer, the lonely mind seeks a refuge" "Like waves in the ocean, as one falls back in" "The next one crashes on the shore" "Covered in red since birth!" "Stained in blood for life!" Why are you here? Why can't I be here? Why is your rickshaw parked here? Where else do I park the rickshaw if not on the road? So, you're here to create a scene! We know that you're responsible for Nagendran's murder! Who's next?! Me?! Are you crazy? I came here for a ride. Hello, where are you? Then why did you make me wait here?! Okay, I'm coming. Wait... I didn't give up everything cos I'm afraid. Don't mess with me. If you come at me, you're done for! To heck with you! You! Weren't you with Sumesh when he killed our Kanakan? You think you're too smart, huh? Wait for it! You're next! Come on, man! Where are you going? To the shop? Yes, to buy the ration. What happened? Keep walking, I'll tell you while you walk. Where are you from? I'm not from here. But Sumesh knows me. Wait a minute, are you really Sumesh's mother? Did you actually give birth to him? Obviously, I birthed him. You don't vomit children out, no? Tell me, what's your problem? Kanakan's mother didn't vomit him out either, she also birthed him. You know, the same Kanakan, who was butchered by Sumesh. An old saying goes, the woman who gives birth to a snake shall broom the path and keep it clean. Or else, her reptile offspring will hide among the trash and bite the passers- by, it seems. To avoid that, the woman who births them shall broom the path. And you didn't do that. Just look around. this place is full of trash! Eww! Shouldn't you suffer the consequences? Shouldn't you be punished for giving birth to him, you hag! Shouldn't you?! OH, NO! Oh, no! My house! Oh, no! 'Is that lady okay?' She's not some random 'lady', comrade. She's the mother of the guy who's in jail for the party. You can also pay a visit and check on her! Rameshan, step on it! Here, here, this way. - Just see if there are any documents. - Sir, this has been blown to bits. All of you move to the side and make way. You're safe, right? That's all that matters. It's just a house. We'll rebuild it. A concrete house with iron grills around it. Let those dogs try to blow that apart! Just because we're lying low, they think they can mess with us! Now, what do you want? We need Ammini chechi's statement. - If we get a complaint from her... - She has no complaints. She doesn't need your help either. Understood? Chandran, I haven't forgotten how you "helped" my guy! You may leave. And tell your men who are their spies, that it's better they end it here, now. Or else, once we start chopping off their heads, there won't be an end to it! You get me? Do you get me, Chandran? Yes. Then, get going! Call all your men and get the hell out of here! Come. We know who did this, Sadetta. It's Harichandanam auto's driver, Lakshmanan and his guys. You tell us what should we do? Go and get a car first. Keep it inside. Take the things from the car. In your present condition, you'll need a mother. Ammini chechi's house construction will be over by the time you give birth. Does all this scare you? After living here for a while, that fear will go away. Your mind will get stronger. Your baby will also be strong and fearless! Do you know why? The children here do not grow up listening to movie songs but to the chants of 'Inquilab Zindabad'. - Hizana... - Sreejith, is it over? Anything else? - Who'll take this, then? - I'll do it. Ammini chechi, come inside. Get something to drink. Shanu... Did you realise something from today's incident? They believe only Sumesh is the culprit in Kanakaraj's murder. Else they would've bombed your house first. I've kept water here. I'm giving you trouble, no? What trouble? You didn't complain about us troubling you, when we stayed with you, did you? Don't think like that. Shanu... Didn't she get into this situation because of Sumesh's reckless behaviour? Yet you keep justifying him. What's the reason? There must be some reason. You go inside. Cigarette smoke isn't good for the baby. And is it good for you? You know, Shanu, I never knew you were so politically active. Who's that? What's it? Hey! It's us. You didn't sleep yet? It's me, Aji. We'll be guarding you tonight. We can't predict what they'll do. Actually, Sadettan told us not to tell you. You go to bed, comrade. We'll be here. Our guys are guarding the other road as well. Shanu, you go and sleep peacefully. Give me a puff. If you need to be guarded for a night's sleep, it won't be a peaceful one, man. It will be the opposite of peace! Who was it outside? Is there any problem? That was Aji and Sreejith on their way back from the movies after the second show. Son, if I stay here, will you also be in danger? What danger? Stop worrying, Ammini chechi. Go to bed. You're still up? Ammini chechi is worried. That she staying here might put us in danger. Are you scared? Me?! Why should I be scared? Are you out of your mind? Come, let's sleep. I'll recharge my phone by the time you buy the medicines. This medicine is prescribed for ten days. It'll cost 230 rupees. 230?! How much will it cost for five days? For five days... two of these are antibiotic. You've to take the entire course. Can't take just half. You can give him his medicine first. I'll buy it after that. - Hey, don't worry. I'm not in a rush. - Give that here. Shall I take everything on this? Yes, you can! Don't have to cut it down. Do you want this candy? No, she has fever and vomiting. And it's cos you keep eating junk. You can have it once you're better, okay? Moreover, these candies decay your teeth. Show me your teeth. You've perfect teeth! Sajani chechi... I got stuck in a traffic jam. Why didn't you inform me earlier? I would've given it yesterday itself. She only had a slight fever yesterday. I thought she'd get better. These days you've to be careful even if it's a fever. They're kids after all. Okay I'm off. I'll be at my workplace. You can give me all the medicines. You can give them. They were here first. She can't wait to have all these candies once she's better! Right? What's your name? Shreya. What a great name! - In which grade are you studying? - Third. - So you are a big girl! - Alright. Come. Listen up, dude! Don't overdo it! What's wrong with you? Do you know who they are? Eh? Kanakan, the one we finished off... ...that's his wife and child. What are you doing in the middle of the night, Hizu? I was reading about nutrition for women during pregnancy. Fruits, green veggies, sprouts... Sprouts, my foot! Come and sleep! Sumesh... How are you, man? Had fun in jail? Of course! It was superb. I thought you didn't come. How could you even think like that? - All fine? - Perfectly fine! Long live the revolution! Long live the revolution! Long live the revolution! - Greetings. - Sit down, Sumesh. Conducted a parade, huh? A mini road show! We rocked it! Did you go home and see your mother? I went and saw the house. But haven't gone to see Mom yet. Why so? You should've gone to your mom first, right? Well, now... You can meet her after you're back. Alright, so let's go ahead like we discussed. Call me later. - Bye. - Okay. Sadetta, we are off. Alright, then. Your train departs at 4:30 p.m. For the time being, it would be better if you go into hiding. They've taken a new decision. Finish off the killer... or kill the leaders. It's fine, let them go for the leaders. In their eyes, it's people like me who are the leaders. But I won't let them touch you. Let them kill me if they want, Sadetta. I have no fear. Don't talk nonsense! The issue is not about you being scared or not. If you, the only accused in this case, goes into hiding now, this whole problem will end here. Then it's best you go, man. And anyway, what's the point of all this after all... What?! Huh?! What did you just say? I was saying... if him being away means lesser trouble, then... Isn't that what I just told him? Why do you have to repeat it? You know the circumstances under which he went to jail... ...and the reason for his current plight? Don't you? I do, Sadetta. Then, stop with the preaching. It has some essentials and money in it. Here's your ticket. For the time being, only you need to know the destination. I'll explain the rest later. Keep this. I'll call you on this number. Get going, son. Listen. Did you check the train number and destination? I didn't check. Here, you check if you want. No! No need! Didn't Sadettan say no one should know? What do I have to hide from you, man? Don't get all sentimental, you dog! It's just that you're not used to travelling so far. I don't want you to screw up and get on the wrong train and end up in the wrong place! Doesn't matter which train as long as I'm absconding, no? And without you guys around, I don't care for any place! Don't worry, I won't get on the wrong train. You've to be careful. You've a family now, unlike any of us. Be very careful. Shall I go? Why are you looking like this? Say something. Nothing, man. You go. I'll come back, man... ...to see the baby when you become a father. I wanted to see my mom. It's okay. You just tell her. I'll get going then. He should've thought before he set out to kill people that there will be no peace in life afterwards. No matter where he goes, he'll never find peace! He'll never do well! Never! Couldn't you've told Sumesh to come see her before he left? Why?! Why does he need to be told? He himself should think, right? But how will he?! A mother means nothing to a cold-blooded murderer! Mother, my foot! Running away isn't going to be enough! He'll be on the run forever like a cursed soul! Let him run! Let him run like a rabid dog! You idiot! Stop cursing Sumesh, Ammini chechi! In fact, it's not him... but me, who should be on the run. It was for me that he went to jail... and is now suffering all this plight! Kanakan was killed by my hands. It's me who should be cursed... by all of you. "Under the blazing red blood moon" "He drifts away, in lieu of me" "A solemn ballad echoed" "Through the stormy rhythm" "Dreams that turn into" "A never- ending agony" "O dear woman" "Is that a rainstorm in your eyes? " It wasn't your greatness that made you confess now! It's cos you know, no matter what you say, I have no place to go from here. And since I'm pregnant, I'll be hanging on to you, right! What all are you saying, Hizu? What other secrets have you hidden from me? How many more have you killed? I'm not a contract killer or anything. Then, what are you? Tell me, who are you? A political activist? Are you? ARE YOU?! Aren't I? Are you asking me?! Alright! Let it be so if you think you are. Then, tell me. For which political movement did you kill him? What social gain did this land achieve because of it? Tell me? Why did you kill him? They killed our Nagendran. Oh! So, you killed the killer! An eye for an eye! Hey leader, if this is politics to you, why are you and your party playing hide and seek? Someone goes into hiding! The party denies any knowledge! And the real culprit is a liar! Why don't you say it out loud like real men? That we butchered a man alive for the greater good of this country? Why won't you say it, huh? That means you know... what you've done is wrong! Hmph! Political activist, it seems! I've never even seen you touch a newspaper with your hand. What do you know about politics? Nothing. I didn't become a communist by learning about it from books. I became a communist even before I could read or write. You know it. It wasn't my parents who raised me. It was my party. So, no matter where I hear 'Inquilab', I will shout out 'Zindabad'! Not because I know what it means. But out of this belief that... the party and its flag belongs to ordinary people like me. So, you still don't think that it was wrong to kill? Back then I didn't think it was wrong. But now... It's not just guilt... but a fear that keeps haunting me. If something were to happen to me... how will you and our child survive... But right now, I've some peace of mind. Because you know the truth. It's such a huge relief. Get down. You've showered and dressed up, my child! You may have some sacred food. Give it to me quickly. I've to go. Only after offering it to Lord Murugan first. Then you do it. I'm off. Wait for a second, my child. Where's my bell? I haven't seen your bell or anything, okay! Where did it go? Now you don't have to look for your bell to offer this to the Lord! So greedy! Still, where is my bell? It must've run away cos it's fed up! '- Come on, man!' - Yes, I'm coming. Don't search for that bell anymore, Dad. But it's God's bell, after all. Thank God! "In a short span of two or four days" "You make people climb up the steps, O Lord" "In a short span of two or four days" "You make people climb up the steps, O Lord" So, you were hiding here! Come, come! Come here. Come. Let's go. Yes, let's go. What's the point of waiting here? You get in the car with Sunoj. No. I'll go with my Dad. It was me who hid that bell. Eh?! Don't cry. Aji... Please don't cry. His death was quite a comedy, wasn't it? At least he's got his near and dear ones with him. That's a relief. You go see him in the morning, okay? Eh? I came here cos you were annoying me! Go somewhere there and scream-- 'You still got that cough?' No, it's not getting better cos of all the dust here. Listen, can I ask you something? Yes, what's it? Are you mad at me? For what? What's the matter, man? Nothing. I was just asking. Do you want to talk to your mom? Yes, give her the phone. Ammini chechi... Sumesh is on call. He is fine, right? That's all that matters. I don't really have anything to tell him. Listen... Ammini chechi is busy with work. You hang up now. Call her later. Okay, man. Bye. Who was that? Your friend? Not just a friend, he's my brother. What happened? Eh? Do you want water? - It's alright. - You can have it. Thanks. Quenched your thirst? Couldn't you ask me if you wanted water, Hizu? Why bother others for things I can do by myself? Bother others, huh?! If you hate me, at least be honest about it. Be frank and tell me. Did you study MA Psychology or tailoring? Do you want me to leave?! One masala dosa and a strong black coffee for me. Bring the coffee after the food. One masala dosa and strong coffee for you. What about you? I'll tell you. Not yet decided. A pregnant woman should eat on time for the child's well-being. That's why. Of course, why not. I didn't say anything. A pregnant woman should also be happy for the child's well- being. Isn't it? Happy! Even as I sit here, I'm afraid. Now I'm scared even if someone stares at me. Happiness, it seems! Hizu... We've argued about this for over a hundred times now. Can't you just let it go already? I've become better! Upon you, I've changed for the better! I swear, Hizu. Now I really know how difficult it is... for a mother to cross the road... with a fatherless baby. Huh, what?! When someone is trying to change for the better, instead of strongly supporting... what are you even doing, man? If you still cannot understand me, I will have to take some tough stances. I've apologized to you in every language I know. If you still can't understand me, I'll fall on your feet begging for your forgiveness. What the hell are you doing? I don't know what else to do, Hizu. Stop it! Don't play around. I can't keep up with this pregnant belly! Then, tell me... Tell me that you forgive me. I swear on our child, I've changed, Hizu! Look at my face. Am I the same old guy? There's an innocence, right? Just a little... Come on, look at me. Look at my eyes. Please look! Don't you see it? That's why you smiled, right? Yeah, right! So much innocence! Finally! You understood! Actually, is there more innocence in this eye or in this one? Watch your step. Brother, what about the masala dosa? She changed her decision, brother. Now she wants fish biriyani from MVK hotel. Then an ice cream and a visit to the beach. I also want to go to Nimisha's house. Yeah! To Nimisha's house as well! What to do! Pregnant women and their cravings! - Okay, bye then. - Alright. Your friend has chosen a great area to live in! What's wrong with this area? What's wrong you mean?! We are now going to travel beyond our national border! This is 'their' party village. Oh, God! I don't even have a helmet! Like you always wear a helmet! - I'll come back soon. - Hey! - Hari kutta, get off. - Hey, you! Did you even look before you ran across the road?! Such a brat! Sorry, these kids are very reckless. Hari Kutta, move Hari kutta, get up - No - Let him play. - You come here. - What happened to you? Start the bike. That is Kanakan's wife and kids. Let him play with it. Dad got this for me, right! Aren't you too young to play with that? Shall I go and apologise to her? What?! I mean, shall I go and apologise to Kanakan's wife? 'Shreya, don't you've anything to study?' Their curse shouldn't fall on our baby. Stop acting crazy! For my peace of mind at least. Don't give me any peace of mind, okay! Come, my son! Let her play with her bike! No. Let him sit here. But I'll push you around! Come on! Look Hizu... They've moved on with their lives. Those kids are coping with their father's demise. Their mother too... We shouldn't remind them of the past and ruin their peace of mind for our sake. No need! Come, let's go. What's up? You've stopped here for a while now. Nothing, we just randomly stopped. For what reason did you come here? We didn't come. We're actually going. Where to?! To her friend's house. HEY! Catch him! Slaughter him right now! - What's the matter, Lakshmanan? - He's that scoundrel Sumesh's friend. Stop him! - Catch him, Lakshmanan. - You won't go back from here! - Get the vehicle, catch him! - Will finish you today, you dog! Hizu! Are they following us? Are they? Go slow! I said go slow, Shanu! - Are they following us? - No, they are not. Slow... Check once more. Is that auto- rickshaw behind us? Why are we taking this route? Their office is on that road. They must've rounded up people there. You rode so fast! I thought the baby would pop out! Are you okay? - Nothing to worry, right? - God knows! You don't know what they are capable of! They won't think twice before finishing us off. There are no saints here! Isn't it better to leave this town than live in fear? You mean to fly the coop? I'm serious. Flying the coop is better than living in fear and uncertainty. If there's a place where people don't die, tell me. We'll take off! Philosophy! Let's go. Look how smoothly this bike starts when it's not an emergency! Those children's faces are etched in my mind. Don't ask me if I am fine, Shanu. Without you guys, I'm not doing fine. I know, man. But we have no choice. How about I-- How about I come there, just to see everyone and then immediately leave? Eh? I've spare money from a few days' payment as well. If I could come, I can give it to Mom. Shanu? Shanu! I'm fed up, man. I'm exhausted. What is it that you want now? You wanna come here, that's all, right? Yes, that's all I want. But you are not letting me. You... you come. Are you serious? Or just pulling my leg? You come, man. We'll handle the rest after that. Hang up now. Okay. Ammini chechi? Your special fish curry with green pepper, right? The one you used to cook for Sumesh and me? Can you make that curry with this? But today's dishes are ready. That's okay. Make this one as well. What's with this sudden craving? A craving, that's all! Why? Are you also pregnant? Oh, God! Ammini chechi is cracking jokes! You watch and learn from her. I meant her fish curry recipe, not her humour sense! I'll be outside. Don't ask me where I reached. I don't know the name of this place. The driver said the bus would reach the stand at 7:30 p.m. Should I buy some stuff for you? The other thing? Drinks? Oh! No need to buy just for me. Buy it for Aji and Sreejith if they want. Did you tell them that I'm coming? I told them to come here in the evening. But I haven't told them the reason. Cool! So, it's a suspense! Yes, my boy! A big surprise! I'll call you once I'm close. Alright. Tell me the truth, who's coming? You look like you're up to something! Fine, I'll only tell you! Don't tell Ammini chechi about this. Sumesh is coming today. The bus will reach the stand at 7:30. She should only know when he comes here! She must get a shock! Will you snitch on me? No, no! I won't tell her. It's gonna be a big surprise! I kinda knew it right away! This green pepper fish curry is Sumesh's favourite! Don't tell him that I told you. I don't know why, I can't keep secrets like before. Maybe it's because I'm pregnant, right? Is it? Perhaps! That's what I thought. Wonder what time the bus will arrive... He told me to not reveal it at any cost. At 7:30. 'Hello?' 'Shanu, I am entering the bus stand.' 'Where are you?' I'm here, right outside the stand. 'Where?' - Where are you? - I reached. Shanu! Shanu, I'm here! Come in. You sit inside. I'm coming. [Party workers shouting the slogans] Inquilab Zindabad! Inquilab Zindabad! Inquilab Zindabad! Inquilab Zindabad! Hey, I'm inside the bus stand. [Sumesh grunts in pain] Hello?! Sume... Sumesh?! Hello?! Who... who's that?! [Intensified shouting of slogans continues] "Under the blazing red blood moon" "He drifts away, in lieu of me" "A solemn ballad echoed" "Through the stormy rhythm" "Across the flaming passages" "Through the dark pits of death" "Traversing distances" "Your lone journey" The cremation is over. So is the hartal. The condolence meeting is also over. What next? Sunoj... tell him. Kannikkara Prabhalan, N.P. Satheeshan, Karimbadanna Sura, these are the guys who killed Sumesh! Harichandran and Lakshmanan informed on him. Their throats are not made of iron or rock. Sadetta, all you have to do is say it! I won't say it, Sunoj. I won't. I can no longer bear to see my children, not one of you, in Sumesh's condition. I'm growing older. Maybe my resilience is fading. Some people are already blaming me for Nagendran and Sumesh's death. Let them... But I'm not putting forth any suggestions on this matter. Come in. Come! Sit on this chair. Come sit here and you decide everything. You called him here and let them knife him down, didn't you?! Why do you think I send him into hiding? Because I'm an idiot?! Sadetta, I didn't- - Come sit on this chair. And answer their questions. Tell them what we can do for Sumesh, who was brutally slaughtered for your sake! I'm sorry. To them! It was my mistake. I never thought this would happen. All of you, please forgive me. I'm sorry. We don't need your damn sorry! We'll be on the front line. Will you join us? You're the reason this happened, right? Answer them! You're the only one responsible for this! We can go and finish them off. Or I'll go and kill them. I'm ready to die. But will it end there? It won't, right? How many more should die... in this game of vengeance? This is escapism. Washing his hands off! Ever since he got married, he behaves like an Islamist! - Mind your words! - Shut your face! You guys keep supporting him! EVERYONE SHUT UP! Why don't you all beat each other to death! Don't start with the anti- party branding and cornering as soon as there's an altercation! Shanu... You cannot walk away from this, both on a personal and party level. There needs to be a clear explanation and response from your end. Sadetta, everyone is saying that Sumesh died for me. Didn't I kill Kanakan for the sake of the party? And Sumesh was killed in retaliation- - Now the blame is on the party! Shut your face! Carry on... Don't I have responsibilities that go beyond killing people for my atonement and avenging Sumesh. His mother, our Ammini chechi... and Hizana, who gave up everything for me. Shouldn't I live for them, Sadetta? Shanu... Beyond everything you just said, there's a party that raised you and Sumesh, who died for you. Don't you've a duty and obligation to them? If he died for me, my duty is to live for him, Sadetta! What is he blabbering, Sadetta?! What I am saying is... We've a lot of great martyrs who died for our party and our country. But if we get killed, we won't be considered among them! Either we kill at the behest of some leader or to get even, or just cos someone booed, tore up a flag or swore at our father! I don't see any politics or revolution in this! This is what I'm trying to say! All reactionaries have the same lame excuses. Feel free to switch sides any time. But don't blame the party for that. No matter what you all say, if Sumesh died for my sake, my duty is to live for him. It's definitely not to kill or die! Red salute! Why didn't you come in? What's there for that? Nothing... That's what... Are you coming with me? No. Hang on, don't leave! No matter how you justify it, what you said in there was a load of crap! How can we just let go of those rascals who killed our Sumesh? Don't teach me. Listen... they'll hatch many plans! But, you please don't be a part of it anymore. Don't do anything. What are you trying to do? Protect me?! If you and I get slaughtered, no one will hail us as Che Guevara, you dog! I'm amazed, my friend! Amazed! Go on now! You go! You go wherever the hell you want... and live! Live a happy life! Go, man! Go! - Hey... - It is best if we don't talk! - Sree... - Get lost! Ammini chechi... Give me some more rice. And curry too... I feel so hungry nowadays. Probably because Sumesh's food is left. Maybe, I have to eat his share as well. I'm not sure if this is hunger or greed. I feel greedy... for both food and life! Did you eat, Ammini chechi? I'm also eating a lot of food these days. I guess only hungry mothers will have the fortune of eating the funeral repast of their own children! Especially the mothers in this place! Uff! Who made the curry today? Ammini chechi. Why? Ah... It's very nice. Isn't her house construction over? You mean Ammini chechi's house? Mm... It should be almost done. Yes, it should be. She must go from here. Only then will I have peace. I'm scared to even look at her. Nowadays, I don't speak to her that much. Neither does she. Eh?! Her son died because of you, right? She'll be carrying that grudge. Even towards our baby! Nah... I feel it in even in the way she looks, Shanu! Does she have a problem with me being alive? Everyone's saying the same. Even you said so. That Sumesh died because of me. It's true. Yes, it is. Your tea... It's only tea! Everyone's saying that Sumesh died because of me. Is that what you think as well, Ammini chechi? Do you? Did I kill Sumesh? I don't know. Still... the answer isn't no. I've never believed in those ruthless Gods to think all this was God's will! That's true. I understand. You are right! Wait... Do you wish to see the ones who killed Sumesh dead? Tell me. If you want it, nothing will stop me, Ammini chechi. Shall I? What more should I say, huh?! Wouldn't my silence be better for you? Fine, no need! You don't have to say anything, Ammini chechi. I understand... I understand everything! He's seeking my permission to kill Sumesh's murderers. Who's Sumesh's murderer? The ones who send these guys to kill and die are living a peaceful life somewhere, with their family and children, all happy! They themselves will never kill anyone and no one will dare touch them! And they have these guys, who'll die a dog's death for them! To show the gratitude of being alive, it's necessary to kill at least one of them or die. "Hearts ripped open, the ones who fell for their rulers!" "Those who became one with the earth for their heavenly commanders!" "The ones who celebrated their crusade on the battlefield!" "The ones who rubbed salt into the bruised hearts of mothers!" "The ones destined to burn in the fires they ignited!" Kannikkara Prabhalan, N.P. Satheeshan, Karimbadanna Sura! For someone who betrays everyone, you will definitely know where they are hiding out. I need them! I need at least one of them! Tell me, you pig! If you're such a hero, go and find them yourself, you pig! I need to finish off at least one of them! I need to do this! It doesn't matter even if it is you! Uncle, no! N... no! No! Please, no! No! It's... It's okay... N...no! Don't do it, uncle. No, dear. No, I won't. I'm going, okay. Don't be scared, okay. It's alright. It's okay. It's nothing. Shanu... Mm... hmm. You've become so cold. Are you pulling my leg? I failed... You're a winner, man! The one who defeated provocations! You'll never be able to kill anyone ever again. Your journey of transformation into a human and a Marxist is almost over. Do all dead people talk crazy like this? Death! Death will liberate man from all kinds of stupidity. It can make a fool think wisely and talk like Abdul Kalam. And sometimes, we can even make certain predictions, like a monk. C'mon! It's not funny, okay? Get lost, you dog! Fine, let me tell you something so that you believe me, okay? I want a treat! Hello... Do you know how many times I've tried calling you?! Hizana delivered a baby! It's a boy! You... You are something else, man! Of course, I'll treat! Do you know what I'm going to name my baby? Sumesh! 'COMRADE SUMESH CHANDRAN' 'A MAN CAN BE DESTROYED BUT NOT DEFEATED.'
