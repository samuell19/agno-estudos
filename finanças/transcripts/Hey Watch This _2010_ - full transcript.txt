Yeah, Cheech and Chong! Cheech and Chong! Cheech and Chong, yeah! Welcome to QTV, I'm your correspondent Doug, and this is my partner Dougie. Hello. How did you get these seats, dude? Oh, my cousin gave them to me. Yeah, after I put a knife up to his throat. And we're here to critique the costumes of the Cheech and Chong show. I like these guys, man. Yeah, they're funny. Got all their records. I stole all their 8-tracks. All right, all you knuckleheads in the back drinking, get your asses back here and in your seats so we can get this show going. Ladies and gentlemen, your featured act this evening has appeared on Howard Stern and Comedy Central. She's also appeared in three Cheech and Chong movies. She's Tommy Chong's favorite co-star. Please welcome the very funny and very sexy Shelby Chong. Oh, hola. Let's hear it for San Antonio. A little skinny for me, but that bitch is hot. Yeah. Did everybody get high to come see Cheech and Chong? I had a little shitzu like that. - You're serious. - Mmm. Did you guys get high at home or in the car? Don't you love pot? Isn't it the best thing in the whole world? I love pot! It makes everything better. Food tastes better. Tommy thinks I'm a fabulous cook. Sex is better. Hey, this is cool out here, man. Hey, all right. Yeah, this is nice. Fucking cold, man. Do you guys know what smoking pot is good for? Everything! Well, it's good for when you're PMSing. When I'm PMSing, Tommy smokes a ton of pot. Hey, well, light it up, man. Light what up? The joint, come on. I don't have a joint. What? You invited me out here, man. But I don't-- Stupid. Hey, Shelby's kicking ass. Yeah, she's doing good. And when we first met Cheech, we didn't even know what a Mexican was then. And then Tommy figured it out. He said, "Shelby, it's like an Indian without a casino." I got a roach. Ha ha! I have a roach. Hey, the roach will do. Oh, shit, it's starting to rain. Here. Here, put this on your head. It'll keep you dry-- hat dry for the show. Oh, okay. What a good idea. All right, light it up. - I don't have a match. - What? I got no-- Fuck, it's cold. We got to go. Come on. We don't have time. Let's go. Fuck Bush for putting Tommy Chong in jail for selling a bong. - Yeah. I'm so glad we're rid of him. There's no door handle. What? Well, open it. It's not opening. Hey, hello. And I woke up. My head was banging. Then I realized it was someone banging at the door. Hey! I can't hear when you're fucking banging. Hold on. And there's, like, ten cops standing there. They got their rifles out and their helmets on. They're, like, banging, banging at the door. Finally, Tommy opened up the door and goes, "Hey, man, Dave's not here." We got to go. We got to go. - There's a thing. - Oh, that looks dangerous, man. Well, you go first. Why me? Because you go on first. Come on. Let's go. Well, how-- how do you do this? It's weighted. You just got to go to the end. Hey, any you guys seen my guys around anywhere? Oh, shit. I'm getting close here, you know? And I really am getting a little bit nervous. Shit. Come on, we got to go, man. Shelby must be off by now. If you guys are gonna start a glass business or a bong business, don't put your face on the bong. That doesn't look stable at all. Wait, whoa. And then the cop comes up and goes, "Mr. Chong, have you got any marijuana in here?" "Of course I do. I'm Tommy Chong." And the judge sentenced Tommy to nine months in jail. See you, sucker. I'm sitting there thinking, "Wow, I fucked up. I should've married Cheech." But thank God for conjugal visits. If Cheech didn't visit me once a week-- Fuck off, man. Don't piss around. I wouldn't have fucked anybody. Hey, hello. Jesus Christ. Fuck! God damn it. Thank you very much. That's my time. Now for the stars of the show. Through those doors. The Maharishi of Marijuana! - Excuse me. - Hey, back up. Hold on. Hold on. We're Cheech and Chong. Join the other Cheech and Chongs. Get in the back of the line. We're Cheech and Chong. This is Cheech. The Pope of dope. Why don't you get in line like everybody else? Cheech and Chong! Shit. Hey, guys. Come on, man. She's about to go off. - What are you doing, man? - How come the doors are locked? Tommy is right in back of me. Which one is that, Ching or Chang? He gained a little bit of weight, didn't he? A little weight, yes, he did. He's giving those suspenders a workout. You're Tommy? Can I have your autograph? Chinga, chinga, chinga, chinga, chinga, chinga, chinga, chinga. Chinga, chinga, chinga-- Cabr?n, cabr?n, cabr?n, cabr?n. Puta, puta, puta, puta, puta, puta. Hey, I'm just a love machine And I don't work for nobody but you Ooo, hey.

Anything special? Oh, you want to find out, man? Here we go. Hey, how far you going, man? The end of the block is fine, man. Here we are at the live Cheech and Chong Light Up America Show. And look who we have here. Sister Mary Elephant. Hey, ese, you ain't afraid of a little speed are you, man? You got speed, man? Oh, no, you know what? I had a bunch of speed last night, man. But I had to take it because I had to cram for my urine test this morning, man. Hey, but you know what I do got, man? I got a joint, man. I taught Cheech in grade school from grade 1 to 8. I can't believe it. And what kind of a student was he? Well, he was very squirrelly until we got him on those pills, and then he calmed down quite a bit. Come on, light it up and let's get Chinese eyes, man. Looks like a toothpick, man. No, no, it's just rolled real tight, man. Tight, tight. No, it's a toothpick. It's not a-- Fuck, it's a toothpick.

Here's the other one, man. Light that puppy up, man. Geez, I hope your dick's bigger than this, man. You want to walk, man? Shit, fuck. You're here to see Cheech and Chong? Well, yes, because Dave's not here. I don't know what that means. Oh, my goodness. But I have the T-shirt. Please, boys and girls. Please, could you bring it down? You know, I wouldn't feel right smoking this little guy. What? Give it back, man. You keep it. I got a joint I've been carrying around with me for a while. Oh, that's cool. Boys and girls. Boys and girls. Shut up! It looks like a number 3 burrito, man. All right, fuck, yeah, man. Shit, man. Yeah, man, this tastes-- Fuck. Is he supposed to be smoking a joint? Uh, I don't know. I can't see that far, man. Kind of grabs you by the poo-poo, don't it? Hey, smoke a real one, man. Tastes weird, man. Oh, that's the K-Y jelly, man. What? Yeah, I got a friend in jail, man. And he wanted me to smuggle some dope in for him, you know? So I smuggled it in, but I forgot I had it, man. So I smuggled it back out, man. I thought that was peanut butter on there, man. Fuck. Eh, fuck it. I kind of like the K-Y jelly because that way your lips don't stick to the paper. But you only need a little bit, man, because this shit will tear you up. God damn, man, I can't feel my lips. Oh, that's the Preparation H, man. Am I driving okay, man? I think we're parked, man. Am I parked okay? Well, we're stopped in the middle of the road, man.

Bless you. Bless you. Bless you. Well, our long nightmare is finally over. Cheech and Chong are back together again. Yes, yes. Whoa, Cheech and Chong back together, yeah. How exciting is it being at the Cheech and Chong show? Isn't this great? I'm plotzing here. No one's happier than l, I'll tell you, man. Because I was tired of hanging out at Home Depot. You know? Really, I'd look over the guys, and if I found one that looked like Cheech I'd hire him. He get in the car and he'd go "?Trabajo?" I'd go, "No, smoko." There you go. It's sort of a bummer, though, that you guys didn't get to be in the show. Well, we-- They asked. Our agent really screwed everything up. He thought we were busy. We weren't busy. And we weren't busy. Of course you weren't busy. Who would want to hire you guys? We were busy, but not that busy. Not that we couldn't drop everything to do Cheech and Chong. We'd do them in a second. The truth is we broke up because we got rich. And you can't make a rich Mexican do shit, boy. Yeah! Over the years I'd say, "Cheech, we got to work." He'd go, "l don't think so, man. "You go ahead, ese. I'm gonna-- "I'm gonna stay here and do something for my people. "Yeah, I'm going to learn Spanish." Hey, I'm learning Spanish. I know my Mexican name-- pendejo. Yes, it means "my very good friend," right? Yes. But when we got together, the only problem we had was what to do. Because we hadn't been together for a long time. So what we did, we got on YouTube. And the one bit that really stuck out is the one we're gonna do now. It's called "Let's Make A Dope Deal," and here's your host, Wayne Dickerson. Let's make a dope deal. I don't got nothing on me. Hey. Hey, peace on you. Peace on you. Peace on you. Peace on you. Hey, Jimmy, the idiots in the balcony are throwing shit, okay? Shit. - It's joints, but still. - Okay. Play America's favorite daytime buzz show, Let's Make A Dope Deal. Are you ready to play? I don't know if blue is the best jacket for him. All right, is everybody ready? Are they toked up? I wonder who he blew. So let's not waste any more time. Let's bring up our first contestant. Let's have a big warm welcome for Bob Mitchell! Yeah! Whoo! Yeah! Nothing's sadder than an old hippie. Mmm. How you doing, Bob? Uh, bitchen, man. He's bitchen. Well, you look bitchen. This is for you, man. Oh, thank you, man. You smell bitchen, too. Now, I understand, Bob, that you're the head of the experimental chemistry department at Texas A&M University. Yes, I am, man. Wow. Longhorns! That is-- That is-- Moo! That is very impressive. Now, what kind of experiments you guys been doing lately? Lately, we've been just fucking the dog and selling the pups. Really, man. That's-- That's great, Bob. We're on national TV. Really? Hey, anybody want to buy a pup? - Oh, let's-- - They're really cute. Tell you what. Why don't we just get right into the game, okay? All right, you know the rules. You start off with a stash of 10 ounces of BC bud. Oh, 10 ounces? 10 ounces. Can I quit now? Uh. No, no, no, you have to play the game. All right, Bob, now, the questions get harder at every level. So how many ounces you want to bet on the first question? The whole 10, man. All of them! He's gonna double his stash. Double my stash. All right, here we go, Bob. For 15 ounces, you ready? Okay.

He's gonna double the stash again. All right, here we go, Bob. Second question, gets harder now. Spell your name. Spell your name. Spell Bob. Spell Bob? Spell Bob. All right, I'll give you a hint. It starts with a B. B. B, right. O! Uh, I'll give you another hint. It ends with a B. BB. So close. So close. Tell you what. I'm going to double your stash again. What do you think of that? - Oh! - Absolutely right-- O. B-O-B. You just went on to the next level. - Way to go. Let's have a hand for him. - I'm on a roll, man. You're on a roll.

Because they got to do the rest of the show, man. Oh, yeah. That's Chong. That's Chong. Go, out. Everybody out. There we go. Okay, standby to restore. Same thing, in the center on Tommy. Thank you. Before we get into our music portion of the show, I would like to talk to you a little bit about my time in jail. Hey, homeboy. Up here. We've been in jail. It's not as bad as you think it is. You know all that Bubba stuff? That homo stuff? It's not true. It doesn't hurt. No, I'm only kidding. I'm only kidding. Hickey, come on, two minutes. Oh, okay. Me, me, me, me, me, me, me You, you, you, you, you, you, you Him, him, him, him, him, him, him They put me in jail for bongs, right? The whole time I was in jail, I kept thinking, "What were they trying to prove here?" Take away our bongs, we won't be able to smoke our dope? Because the truth is you get a bud and no way to smoke it, you turn into MacGyver in a heartbeat, don't you? I've known hippies that couldn't find their ass with either hand, but hand them anything and tell them to make a pipe, and they'll grab it-- I got it. You can use anything to smoke pot out of, man. My favorite is a Tampax tube. Got a real familiar taste, built-in filter, and the greatest thing-- if you got to hide it, just hand it to your old lady. And it's got the little flag on the end so you always know where your dope is. Oh, shit. The other thing I had to do in jail was I had to take a drug education course. Well, actually, I taught it. I did. Fuckers didn't know anything about dope, man. They're trying to tell us that marijuana is a dangerous drug. I told them. I said marijuana is the friendliest drug you'll ever come across. - Right? Listen to me. It's the only drug I know where you take a hit, your first impulse is to give it to somebody. But I like this one, too. Marijuana makes you lazy and unmotivated. Whoa. Now, there's a reason to put someone in jail, huh? Pretty soon, that'll be against the law, and I'll be the first guy in court. I can just see the judge now. He'll be looking at me going, "Mr. Chong, you have been charged with being lazy and unmotivated. How do you plead? Mr. Chong?" "Bailiff, will you wake the prisoner, please?" Well, it's true. Marijuana does make you lazy. In fact, I remember one time I was stoned. I'm laying on the couch, and I couldn't find that channel changer, man. But I noticed if I moved my ass a certain way, the TV would change anyway. I never did find that changer, man. But I got so good, I could TiVo that motherfucker. Let's go, buddy. Our first musical guest tonight is a young man that appeared in Cheech and Chong's Next Movie. Let's hear it for Red Hickey! How y'all tonight? Hey, man, where's the bathroom? You have to use the dressing room. That's the only one that's available. I-- l-- I'm kind of nervous up here. I'm a street singer. I'm not used to being on the stage or nothing, boy. Boy, I'm so nervous, you couldn't get a pin up my ass with a jackhammer right now. I'll tell you what. Thank you very much. Aah, hey, Chong. What's up, motherfucker? Hey, hey, it's me-- Juno. How'd you get in here? Oh, man, it's me-- Juno, you know? Juno? Juno what I'm talking about? God damn, it's hot up here with all these lights and everything. I get relative humidity, you know? That's the sweat that forms on your balls when you're doing your cousin. You know, relative humidity? You get it? Thank you very much. Aah, you look good, motherfucker. Yeah.

Man, that mother's my dawg, man. Yeah. How you jack off a dinosaur? Like this here. You get it? - - Thank you very much. Could y'all help me out, man? I'm a little short right now. Maybe, you know, a couple hundred, 500, a thousand, whatever you got, you know. You know, I don't carry any cash on me. I'm right in the middle of the show, man. I'd really like to do it, but l-- Yeah, gonna be like that? All right. All right. No, seriously, man. Well, you know, I just brought your Chinese food. So have your Chinese food, Chinese motherfucker. We've been traveling all over the country with the Ching and Chang show. Sometimes we don't know where the hell we are, you know?

He said, "Hey, watch this." - - Thank you very much. I'd like to liven up the mood here, and I want-- l-l-I want-- I want to sing a song. Thank you very much.

You could put your head up to it and smell the ocean, you know? It was just a beautiful thing. Beautiful. All right, so I want to sing you a little song.

My mama talking to me trying to tell me how to live But I don't listen to her 'cause my head is like a sieve My daddy, he disowned me 'Cause I wear my sister's clothes He caught me in the bathroom with a pair of pantyhose My basketball coach, he done kicked me off the team For wearing high-heeled sneakers and acting like a queen The world's coming to an end, I don't even care As long as I can have a limo and my orange hair And it don't bother me if people think I'm funny 'Cause I'm a big rock star, and I'm making lots of money Money, money, money, money, money, money I'm so bloody rich. I own apartment buildings and shopping centers. And I only know three chords. Watch me! You fools! Hey, where-- where's Margaret, man? Where'd she go? Where's Margaret? I don't know where Margaret is. She's in the bathroom. Jesus. Hey. Tutus come in handy in so many ways. You know, not just because they look good. But if you walk into a certain spot, the tutu will tell you whether or not you can get out. I'm back! Few people know that. Cheech and Chong! Cheech and Chong! Cheech and Chong! Come on, Margaret, where the hell are you? Get out of that goddamn toilet and get out here. It's only a porno movie. That looks exactly like my father. That looks like one of my ex-father-in-laws. Christ. I never been in a porno theater before. Sure the hell smells weird. Smells like wet puppy. And what the hell's on the floor? I keep sticking to the goddamn floor. There's crap all over the seat. There's something-- Ew. Well, this one ain't too bad. You know, it's the damnedest thing. You know, you pay an arm and a leg to get in these porno theaters, and all they give you is a popcorn box with the bottom cut out. What the hell is this all about? Well, there's a guy got one on his lap. And he's yanking on something, that's for sure. Margaret! Oh, there she is. Margaret. Margaret. Margaret, for Christ's sake, I'm over here. Now, sit your ass down here. We're gonna enjoy this. I don't want to hear this bullshit. What the hell's wrong with you now? Well, I know there's something on the seat. That's why I didn't sit there. Now, come on, sit down. They're starting the movie. Geez, I hope that's not the star. She's uglier than your sister Ethel, for Christ's sake. No goddamn wonder. It is Ethel. Margaret, that's your horny sister Ethel up there. Holy-- We wondered what she'd been doing lately. Looks like she's been doing a lot. Well, just a minute. She's taking off her clothes. No, that ain't Ethel. Oh, come on, lady, what are you gonna do, just stand there with your finger in your muffin? Boy, she's got a hell of an itch, don't she? Oh, those things stretch a mile, don't they? Hey, Margaret, she's smiling at you. Look, she's doing impressions now. Look at this. There's Willie Nelson eating ice cream. Now, what the hell's she got there, a Coke bottle? What the hell is she gonna do-- Oh, for Christ's sake. Margaret, look. Things go better with Coke. Whoa, the goddamn bottle disappeared. You see that? Oh, there it is. Christ, she popped that clear across the room. Did you see that, Margaret? Now, that's muscle control, by Jesus. Now what is that? A big bowl of grapes? What the hell is she gonna-- Well, for Christ's sake. She's feeding it. The furry little monkey eats grapes. Look at that, Margaret. How the hell is she gonna get them out of there? That's what I want to see. Oh, here they come. Oh, Christ, she's eating them. Oh, Jesus. Are you getting sick? Well, don't puke in your purse, for Christ's sake. Here, put your head between your legs. Oh, Christ, that might make you sicker. Sit up here, Margaret. If it's gonna make you sick, don't look, okay? I'll tell you when to look. Margaret, look. They brought in a midget. He got a little bitty-- Oh, no, he ain't. That's the biggest goddamn midget I've ever seen. He's still coming in the door. Margaret, look. He's going up on her. He used it as a pole vault to get up there. You see that? Holy geez, he disappeared. What the hell is that, the Bermuda Triangle? Oh, she popped him out, too. And he's eating the goddamn grapes. Oh, for Christ's sake. Come on, buddy. If you're that hungry, I'll buy you a hamburger. Oh, Margaret, look, look, look. They brought in a dog. He licked that little midget clean. You see that? And he's eating the goddamn grapes. Jesus Christ. Oh, now they're getting sick. Margaret, don't look at this. They ruined the goddamn film. I'm ready to go. You ready to go? Now they brought in some black guy, for Christ's sake. Oh, Jesus. Oh, shit. Yeah, that's horrible. Okay, Margaret, let's go. Come on. When they start-- Margaret. Oh, get it, baby. - Get it, baby. - Ooh. Yeah, get it, baby. - Tear it up. - Yeah. Listen, God damn it, I'm leaving. Are you coming? Hey, man, you into old chicks? Only if they got money, man. And restore, please. In the center, on Tommy. Thank you. If you're a stoner in any way, shape, or form, I would suggest you read the Bible because I checked it out, and I found out that God is a stoner. Oh, shit. Fuck. - My gun. - Oh, hey, man. First of all, the first page, God is known as "the most high." First page. And when he created the heavens and the earth and the universe, on the sixth day, God gave us green herb. Now, what did He do on the seventh day? Nothing. He was too fucked up to work. I'm gonna leave you here. You all right? This is my dressing room. Yep. Right here. Here you go. And He turned Moses on. And Moses talked to the burning bush. I've done that. God appeared to Moses in the form of a burning bush. That meant God had to be the first dealer. Of course He was. He's God. And I can see God on that mountain top right now. He'd be all looking clean, a little bling bling, looking around. And He'd go, "Mo, get your ass over here. This bud's for Jews." Oh, fuck. They were looking for the land of milk and honey. The fuckers had the munchies. I know that pot's good for you because my cat loves to get high. The first time I got my cat stoned, I didn't mean to. I just didn't see him in the room. And I didn't realize he was stoned till I watched him walk off a table. And he didn't land on his feet. No. He took that one extra step and he went all over and started clawing shit. Then he got hung up on one nail, and he's hanging there looking at me. He gives me that look like "I'm okay. No, I'm--" And he got loose. Ohh! This tastes like shit. And I think he got cotton mouth or something because he looked up at me, and he went-- I thought I was going deaf. Then I realized he's fucked up. So I had to give him a little kitty drug test. I threw him at the curtains, and he didn't stick. But he was so fucked up, he's thinking, "Fuck, I'm flying, man." Now, when I call my cat in from outside, I don't go "Kitty, kitty, kitty." No, sir. No. I make a little sound like-- He hears that sound, he'll come running 50 miles away. Then he'll follow me around the rest of the night like a little cat junkie, you know? Fire it up. Come on, man. I want to sit in the window and look at shit. Okay, throw me at the curtains. I wasn't ready, man. But right now, we'd like to take you inside a backyard of-- Well, let's make it here in San Antonio. Where we meet our heroes Ralph and Herbie. Ralph! Herbie! - I thought that was you. - Hey, how the hell are you? It's been a long time. How are you? Hey, you're looking good, man. You got a piercing. How'd you do that, man? I sat on a stapler about 15 times. Wow. It looks really punk, huh? I like it, man. It's so hip. I want to do it. - You gotta show me how to do that. - It's really easy. Hey, I love your new haircut. Really? Wow. What's that? That's like a reverse mohawk, huh? Yeah. Wow. I love how you got the hair to stick straight out like a porcupine. - I'm on a new vegetarian diet. - Wow. My human put me on it because he's trying to help me get my shit together. Thing is, man, with this new diet, I have to shit every five minutes. - Oh, that's-- - In fact, I gotta go right now. - Oh, okay. - Hey, do you want to help me? Well, what do you want me to do? Well, now that you ask, will you lick my balls? This reminds me of Waiting for Godot. Oh, you got a big wad of gum in there. I ain't licking that. - No, no. - Oh, come on, man. No, no, you lick your own. Lick your own. Never mind, I'll do it myself. Well, come on. I need some paper, then. Paper? What, are you gonna read while you shit? No. My human, he taught me how to crap on paper. It's the only way I can go now. Oh, okay. Well, let me find-- Oh, here. Here's some. Well, no, that's a gum wrapper, man. - I need a newspaper. - Oh. Give me the San Antonio whatever the fuck they call it. There you go. All right. Oh, look, it's a picture of Bush and Cheney. Let them go. Hey, Herbie, here it comes. Oh, it's gonna be a big one, too. Oh, looks like the log ride at Disneyland. Keep pushing, keep pushing. - You got it. Oh. - Ow. Wow, look at the size of that mother. Whoa. Did I do that? - Man, you're gonna need stitches. - No kidding. I could've used an epidural for that one. You should have heard the sound when it hit the cement. - Sounded like a ham. Boom. - Whoa, whoa, whoa. - What's the matter? What's the matter? - What's the matter? - Fifi. Fifi. Oh, she's in heat. - Oh, God. - Oh. - Oh, that little poodle gets me so horny. - No kidding, man. - Oh, man, I just want to-- - Hey, knock it off. Hey, hey, no, no. Hey! Oh. Knock it off! I'm sorry. I don't know what got into me. Well, I know what got into me. - Go ahead, get me back. - Get out of here, you homo. Ralph, Ralph. Ralph, Ralph, Ralph. Hey. Don't pay any attention to her. I'll back her into you. Hey, Fifi. How you doing? Hey, where you been? You been on vacation? I like your new glasses. Is that a new coat? You look really good. Hey, nice to see you. Here we go. All right, I got her, got her. No, no, no, not me! Not me! Ladies and gentlemen, give it up for Cheech and Chong. And Shelby! - Oh, good. I got to take a piss, man. - Oh, yeah? Here. Want some pop? And out. Everybody out. Yeah, it's wonderful. Ready, pick them up. Took a walk to the corner store Just to buy a loaf of bread and a box of s'mores Up pulls a guy in a yellow van A shiny gold badge flashes in his hand - He said-- - All right, all you mojados, hit the floor. I got one question to ask and nothing more. Answer in English. That is, if you can. Where were you born, man? Where was I born? That's right, menudo breath, read my lips. Where were you born? I was born in East L.A. Man, I was born in East L.A. Oh, you were born in East L.A., were you? I'm from East L.A. Well, then, I guess you could tell me who the new President of the United States is. What's his name? The President. That's right. Oh, yeah, yeah, I know that guy. The black guy. He just got elected. His name is-- He has a cool name. It's like Arock-- Arock-- Arock Your Mama. Rock Your Mama's the President. Sorry, wrong answer. You're under arrest, Pedro. Come on, let's go. One spot on Tommy and Shelby, one spot on Cheech. Keep them separate, there you go. Good. Next thing I know, I'm in a foreign land People talking so fast, I couldn't understand Nobody there to lend a helping hand I was cold, it was dark, it was a burger stand I wanna go back to East L.A. I wish I was back in East L.A. I don't belong here in downtown TJ 'Cause I was born in East L.A. I crawled under barbed wire, swam across the stream Went under six different trucks packed like sardines Walked all day in the burning sun Now I know what it's like to be born to run Up ahead was the promised land Shining like a star just beyond my hand All I could see was a golden glow I looked up, the sign said 5 zillion sold And I was back in East L.A. Back in East L.A. You know I'm never gonna stray 'Cause I was born in East L.A. Oh, L.A. Too saltay I'm proud to say I'm from East L.A. Let's hear it for Tommy and Shelby Chong. Come on. Whoo! I love being in San Antonio, man. So we'd like to do something very special tonight for you. I hope you like it. It's the only serious part of our whole show. It's a song of my people.
