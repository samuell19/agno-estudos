Hey! What's going on? Slowdown, man. No rush. Oh My god! Your stuff's here. Her truck just arrived from Phisanulok. It had a problem. Really? That's OK. Hello. Is that Mr. Anake. Yes, That's right. Today I received one item, not listed in the order. It is an antique drum inside the box. Please check it for me. Yes...I'll get a hold of you later. Yes...goodbye. Arkorn, speaking... Yes...What's happening, Jieb? How are you? Did you have your baby yet? Uhh, Professor....different Jieb Whoops! Sorry! Uhh, Jieb...Ahh..hmmm I'll remember I'm getting so darn old So what's up? What can I do for you? Well, Jieb received an antique drum from someone. It is around 70-80 years of age. An antique drum.... there are many old books that talk about such instruments. If it had some markings it would be easy to find the origin. Traditionally, teachers put such markings on instruments for good luck. Professor, what does "Ch" written on the side of An antique drum means? Ch... I'm not quite sure. Hmm...It is the same "Ch" used by Master "Jangwang Chuem" a renowned music teacher before the world war II How's it going, Pad? Dear Master, Please look after Paga, sir. You don't have to mention it. Don't worry. I'll take care of her as if she was my daughter. We're here! Raise your hands higher...higher. Stretch you back release...stretch release...stretch Raise your hands higher Gnod, stop!

But if you really want to know... Yes, I do. My best friend experienced once. And he never lies. Why do you ask me? Oh, I was just asking. So what happened to Paga and Fond? Love is a dangerous thing, Jieb. Ah!...Is the professor here? How was it, Fond?... Any good? Very pretty. You made this, Gnod? If you make more we can sell them and make money. If you like it, I'll make more. You can make a lot of money. Buy many beautiful dresses. Are you sure it's OK, Gnod? Is this for real? Please make a lot. - Thank you very much. - Paga! What are you doing? The Professor wants you to practice some dance steps. Wait a minute... just a minute, Sang. I am watching Gnod make some cute dolls. You know, Fond is visiting your principal. He is asking about you. Don't you want to be there? What's wrong with him? Ahh...Mother Pleng. What do you think of Fond? He is quite handsome. Very talented but he flirts a lot. Do you want him as a relative? Mother Pleng... Paga's an adult. I want her to find a good man so she has a good life. But we only recently met Fond. We don't know him. If we rush into this. Something bad may happen. Your daughter Paga will be the one that's hurt. Please think twice. Haven't you seen enough land, Fond? It's quite late now. If you keep roving, we'll reach Chiang Mai. Paga, you kid too much. You doing anything this afternoon? If not, I'd like to continue roving. This place is so beautiful. OK? Gnod... ...Gnod Soi told me you haven't gone out all day. Do you have a cold? Gnod, I bring you some hot soup. I don't want any. Gnod! Paga... you can't even look at my face anymore. Are you teasing me? I know you're engaged to that dummy, right? Gnod, don't call him a dummy. What's wrong with you? Has anyone done anything to you? I don't want you to be my sister... Paga! Paga! Paga! Gnod, It's late. Why aren't you sleeping? I have something to tell you. Wait until tomorrow. It's late. My mother will worry. I want my bracelet back. OK!... If you want it... Just remember that I don't hate you. I want to be your sister forever. After that night. no one ever saw Paga and Gnod again. There were lots of rumors. Maybe Gnod kidnapped Paga... maybe Gnod killed Paga Hey...C'mon in...See for yourself Ahh...pay attention! Master! ...Gnod is not here too. Oh my god...Paga! Pull yourself together. I believe Gnod must know about vanished. And must be involved with this drum. What if it's not what we think. I don't really know. If it were me. I wouldn't keep it in the house anymore. Jieb, I'm back. Jieb Hey... if you're not home. don't keep the lights on That's not good! I thought you weren't home. Why are you dressed like this? Very strange! Vin... Vin...Vin!

I've waited and searched for you for a long time. From now on, I will not let anyone separate us again. You have to come and live with me. You don't love me anymore, Fond. Is that it? Your story ends too easy. Yes, it's too short. What kind of ending you would like? Like... Ghost and human go separate way. - No connection. - Something like that. Think about it Paga gave up so easily. Let Fond go, and end, Just like that. If I were her, I wouldn't do that. OK, I get it. You guys think Paga was too kind? she's been looking for her lover, For 10 years. But the moment they come face to face… she turns soft. Yeah, that makes no sense. Okay, okay, okay.

Are you glad? May I give you the title for this one? Let's just call it Horror Sex on a Horrific night Ugh! I don't like that. Let's try Put her in her grave with pleasure Always picking on someone else. You're not so ordinary yourself, you know. Well then, just tell me this. Is it cruel? I guarantee it, if you watch closely. Can you feel the chill? OK. Have you ever seen a corpse hanging with a rope around its neck? Officer... What ? Mr. Nop, What was the problem With the body yesterday? I believe this is a case of murder. Have you seen my report? I haven't seen anything. First, at the crime scene, there is no chair on which the victim could climb to hang herself. Second, considering the condition of her body. She didn't die right away. She struggled and fought for her life. Last, her house is quite far out. Why did she have to come all the way and die here? You think too much. I think she died because she was strangled. - And then her body was brought here. - This is a suicide case. The way you are analyzing it is illogical. But I think... Think again... This is not a murder case believe me. How much? Small one 10 bath. Big one 20 baht. Give me a big one. What's going on? Hope you're not bringing me another one. No, I'm here because of the girl that was brought in yesterday. Any updates on her case doctor? This isn't a one hour film processing lab you know. I put her in number 8 Doctor, can you put a rush on this one please? I'm working on this one by myself probably wouldn't have it much longer. Problem? She must have been very pretty before she died. Yes, she was. - Hello. - Is that you Nop? I found something. The time of her death is correct, on the 14th. However the condition of her body is very suspicious no broken neck, bruises around her neck and blood clots Have told us that she died because a rope was tied around her neck very slowly. Is there any chance this sort of death was caused by suicide? Very difficult. If it were suicide, there would be more damage around the neck because the weight of the body would have put strain there. Why don't you put this case on hold? Because I told the Deputy it was murder and he doesn't believe me. But the markings on the body are quite suspicious. I showed him the photograph… but he said a suicide can also be like that. Nothing we can do anymore. If we don't have a victim, we don't have a crime. No. I will carry on myself. Here is the victim of the crime. It is so pitiful. Gunya's dad died when she was quite young. Here mother died ten years ago. She did not want to live with us and then she married. To Vinai? Where can I find him? When his wife died, he didn't ever show up. Was there any problems between them? Is there anyone else you can think of that I can contact? Ahh, IU remember. If you want to find more information on Gunya, You must contact Paew. She gave me her name card. She lived around Nonburi. Gunya called her quite often. VCD Are you Paew? Yes, sir. What can I do for you? I'm a police officer. I'm here on the Gunya case. As far as I know, Ever since she married, Gunya and Vinai always had problems. What kind of problems? When she visited, she was always crying. I would always see bruises When she took off her clothes I don't know what Vinai did to her. she had bruises all over her body. Did Gunya ever tell you? She only cried and cried when she came over. At first I was very suspicious… after that I got used to seeing them. Have you ever been to her house? Ever since her husband had a car accident… she said he became strange. She didn't want me to come over at all. Yesterday I went to visit Vinai. No one was home. I don't know anything about that. What about Gunya, did she have any other close friends? As far as I know, she never told me of any Maybe you should talk to her ex-boyfriend. Why? She got back together with him. What's his name? In. This morning I told you, no MSG! And you still put it in. You just don't understand Who are you? Hello, Mr.Vinai. My name is Nop Why are you here? I'm a police officer. I'm here investigating Gunya's death. So it was you who inspected her body. I believe your wife didn't commit suicide. It was murder. What are you talking about? You bastard! You wife must have been very beautiful. So what? There must have been plenty of men interested in her. You must have known. Get out of here. Calm down Mr. Vinai. I'm just trying to see how you two got along. You beat her up, correct? Why did you have to do that? What right do you have talking to me like that? If you don't have anything to hide. my question is easy to answer. Bastard! Get out of here. Before I leave, I'd like to see Gunya's housewares and her belongings. May I? - Hey boy, can I ask you something? - Yes, Sir? You bring food to the guy in that room all the time? Everyday sir. He doesn't go out at all? I don't know. He's crazy. He's afraid a thief will rob his house. - Something wrong? - Not really. I didn't find out anything What? Why not? I'm serious. I asked everyone at the funeral and around the neighborhood. At the old office and the new one. No one knows IN. If there are any, just a little familiar with her. Just move quicker What's going on? While I was following your car, I saw a woman next to you trying to push open the door and get out. I thought something was wrong. It was real! It was alone. But I saw it as well. I've already checked wrong specs. Yes…yes. But I did everything according to spec, sir. I've just been up there myself. I measured it myself. Anyway, you should go up there again. Yes, sir. I'll go up again. Mr. Tongin, sir. Yes, What can I do for you? Do you know a girl named Gunya? If you want to know something just ask. Excuse me but I know she was your ex-girlfriend. I'd like to find out a bit more about her. Was there something going on? He's a cop and he's here just to ask for information. I thought Daddy told you already that…. Never mind Sri. Relax, he's here for other things. OK. Yes. Please excuse me. At that time she was hurt because some guy she slept with lied to her and left. All I did was console her. Then she married that old solider and I haven't seen her since. After that she would call me complaining about fighting with her husband. Then as far as I know she hung herself and that's it. Did she come to see you at all? She just called you? She only called What did she tell you about the fights With her husband? I don't know. She didn't tell me anything. Did you know her husband was hurting her? I don't know. - What do you think... - Sir, I only know what I told you Thank you Hmm…which picture should I choose? Doctor Jade… Are you free? Can I ask a favor of you? It means Tongin talked more than he should. We can test him. I am investing this case now. We could get suspended… You've ask me to be involved Who would think that someone like Tongin would rob the daughter of the Deputy of Interior? Don't try to bring me into that one. This is quite high. If there wasn't a ladder. it would be too difficult to climb. Well the Deputy think it's possible. Hey, doc… Can you read this? It'll take some time. Hello!… What can I do for you? Has he been in there long? Over ten minutes. When he arrived he went straight in. How do you know it was a hooker? My wife was a hooker… my mother was also a hooker. I know about things like this. If you want to know something, this is the best time to do so. Sweetheart, don't move. I'll do it for you honey. Why is this taking so long? I thought you were good bitch. I finally found something. The hanger has blood on it, human blood. Strange thing is blood belongs to two people. one blood sample was Gunya for sure. The other I don't know. Does it belong to Vinai? Chances are 99 % that it is a woman's blood. But you told me Gunya's body had no open wounds. I may have mis-tested. You rushed me. If you want to be sure you have to bring her in again. Can you come with me doctor? It's very clear What's that doctor? Looks like she was 3 months Pregnant but miscarried. From the wounds here… here and there… it looks like her vagina was cut through to her womb. Do you see that? See? What doctor? Four or five days before she died, someone used a solid object to make her miscarry. The suspicious blood no doubt belonged to her baby. Why so weird? He may have been mentally deranged? My friend is checking Vinai's history, we will know soon. Hello, what's up? He's in the bedroom, fixing his bag Hey! I'm coming. If he wants to leave before I get there, please hold him for a while Be careful. He's got a gun. Yes, sir. Jade. The letter you want me to read. I Can do it now. A moment ago there was a fax from the hospital. Thank you very much. Where are you going? Where can I go? You are watching me all the time. That's right! None of your business It was you that killed Gunya and try to cover up. It was I that killed her? Yes, Just like when you used the hanger to hurt her. You know? Why did you do that you bastard? She was pregnant. Son of a bitch! Ahh… I remember you now. It was you. Hello. Is that Nop? Where are you? I'm at Vinai's house. Vinai is not the murderer. I've just received a fax. Vinai is paralyzed from the waist down. He can't walk. Since when? Half a year ago. I can read the letter now In impregnated Gunya. What? In impregnated Gunya. In told her to get rid of the baby or he would kill both of them. She wanted to keep the baby. This letter is proof and tied In to her. Tongin, stop What do you want? More accusations? You murdered Gunya. Gunya…Shit… I know the whole story now. You were afraid that Gunya would tell everything. So you killed her. That's funny. Any more evidence? Gunya… Gunya wrote you a letter but you didn't know it. Pregnant? - You hold me responsible for that? - This is your baby. A woman like you sleep around. - How could you say such a thing? - It could be anyone's baby. Go away. Get out! Don't come back. If anyone had read that, they would know right away you were the killer. You killed her not knowing she had miscarried. You killed her. Are you crazy, the murderer. You're the murderer. Gunya used to tell me that if anyone tried to hurt her, she'd get revenge. Otherwise she would never be happy You bastard! Goddamn bastard! I'll take this one. I like this one. Yes, it's me. I'll seek revenge. Hey Nop… never leave a crime scene. It is my responsibility to Gunya. Dead on the spot He shot back… Dead on the spot. BIG SHOW FOR YOUNG CADET.. RECOVER A MYSTERIOUS COVER UP CASE You can rest now Gunya. You have your revenge Next is the breaking news. The announcement from Thun Thai party Regarding the involvement in the corruption of the Airport construction of Tongin and the followers. Mr. Wiroon Kedklao, the spokesman of the party announced to correspondents this afternoon. The police shot Thongin but actually he was murdered. This is a videotape received from a clerk at the hotel Tongin was a go between for Sae Yoon the ex father in law and a contractor. There was corruption and pay offs. On the 14th, the day Gunya was murdered they had talked all night. he could not have killed her. They wanted him to hide abroad but he was "dead on the spot". Are you seeing someone else? You said you love me? I really loved you. Don't say things like that. Just go. Just go. Don't ever come back. Don't even come to see me again. It's over. Don't you get it? How come? I told you to go back. Never let it loose This is my responsibility for Gunya. Lieutenant, sir. Can you please come to the station? Please! That is quite a story. Really hurt you. I think of all three stories, yours was the most unbelievable. Yes…yes..but for me… I have problem with Jieb's ending. Was Ghost Paga reborn or not? Anyway, where has she been? Hmm…or Fond in Jieb's body which was hidden Excuse me. Check please.
