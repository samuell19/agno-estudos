"Our story begins on the edge of a lonely desert in Arizona." "For it was there, that brilliant scientist Professor Franz Mueller .." "Chose to live and work." "In a great fantastic place he called .." "The Castle." Professor Mueller. I was worried. - Now, now, Mrs Fame. You know what always happens when the professor runs into Phoenix for an hour. Did you have had an interesting day, professor? Quite, Mr Cory. Thank you, Mrs Fame. Why the evening clothes? - Haven't you heard? It is to be a very formal party. Party? Yes, Mrs Graham's inner dance at the Arizona Palm. And you accepted? Of course he accepted. But you are the one who refused. Professor Mueller. No. Those things are not for me. Besides. I have some work to do. - What have you there? Oh Patrick, look. It's a monkey. It's sick. T.B. Where did you find it? Bought it from an organ grinder. Think we can save him? He won't live through the night. Then, why did you buy him? Oh. Yes Janice, another experiment. And I will need some help. You won't give up that? - Give up? I want to prove that an animal and human brain can be kept alive even after death. I shall try and try again until I succeed or I shall die in the attempt. But you already know you can keep the brain alive. I merely think I do. I've never succeeded yet. And if I could prove that. What do I know about the brain itself? Nothing. Can it think? Remember after its body is dead? Could it be made to feel? To hear perhaps? Or to express itself in some way? Contact the living? And if you did find out .. What would be the benefit? You ask me that? Would it not be the achievement of all times? To keep the brain of great thinkers .. Scientists, inventors, artists, statesmen alive? To derive benefit from their wisdom and their thinking power. Even after their death? To make them literally immortal. You of all people should understand my determination. Just being an authority on the encephalograph wasn't enough for you. You wanted the chance to actually work with it to prove .. That it could be practical. - Could be? It is practical. - You see. Your very belief in that shows how determined you are. Although I wasn't every encouraging the first time you wrote to me. The first time? The first twenty times I wrote. I thought you might need me, professor. No experiment can possibly be successful without my two loyal assistants. Providing that your interest in science still comes before dinner parties. What can I do to assist? I need all necessary instruments for trepanation. Yes, professor. Get the blood pump ready and the tube connections for the arteries. We will use the animal's own blood and add haemoglobin in case. And get the encephalograph ready for connection. Yes, sir. And don't forget the gigli saw. The gigli saw? "It was professor Mueller's contention." "That every living brain has an electric beat." "Which can be measured with an encephalograph." "Or electric amplifier." "A pump supplies blood to the main arteries." "In order to keep the tissues .. alive." "As long as the brain functions." "The pen records its beat." "And at the same time computes its strength." Well, you can see from these Alpha and Beta waves, beyond any doubt .. That the monkey's brain is still alive and awake. What's this? The waves have stopped. He died. You must remember the monkey we had was sick. Perhaps if we had an animal that was in perfect health we might be able to .. Perhaps. In any case, I've kept the monkey's brain alive .. For one hour and a half after the animal's death. That is a tremendous step forward in my experiment. And what I did with this simian's brain. I could do with the brain of a human being. If I had one. Well, you don't give up either, do you. You know it is going to be a month since I was invited to a party. Well, you should be where there are invitations every night. You'd get them too. You know .. You don't belong here. - Why not? Professor Mueller says I have the makings of a very good scientist. I know you don't approve of my ambition. But on the contrary, I do. Not too much. I need it. This coat reeks of chloroform. And I don't want to put my dancing partner to sleep. Don't you worry. Besides, you'll only have one of us wide awake. I'll get the car. Yes, we are going to the party. In spite of you. In spite of me? It was clever of you to arrange that .. Emergency experiment. But your timing could have been much better. My dear child, you seem to misunderstand my interest in your welfare. Do I? I only watch over you the way your father would if he were still alive. When father didn't approve of a young man. He said so. He never tried to be subtle. Now you are being unfair. If I was subtle, it was only because I knew little about Mr Cory's background. And when you make a choice, Janice. I want it to be the right choice. I want you to be happy. Professor Mueller. Shall I serve dinner now? No thank you. Send me a sandwich to the lab. I hope you don't mind, Janice. No, but .. Every time I want to talk to you alone there is always so many people about. Yes, I know. Especially at the castle. Well, the castle is a strange place. What with my work and all. - And professor Mueller. No. The lady in black. Say, Janice. How does Mrs Fame manage to be in so many rooms at the same time? Why blame her? Professor Mueller is the one who told you to stay away from me. Well, didn't he? Well he did imply that when your father died in Czechoslovakia that .. You were left to his care. He makes his interest sound so paternal. Doesn't he. Telephone, Mr Cory. Professor Mueller. Put Mr Cory's call on this extension please. Hello? Hello Cory? I am sorry to disturb you. "Don't mind about that. What's the matter? What's happened?" A plane crashed a few minutes ago near the Rangers Station. "There was only one man on duty and he can't locate Dr Martin so he called me." I want to start immediately but there's a problem with the starter of my car. As long as you have the station wagon I thought you would be glad to help out. "I'll leave right away. Goodbye." Oh it's you, Cory. Quick. You had better stay here, Miss. Only two men in there. I think one is still alive. I brought a stretcher along. Get it. I can't go with you. I'm the only one on duty here. Never mind about that. Just keep trying to get Dr Martin. What will I tell him? Tell him there's a chance to save this man's life. We'll be at the castle. Alright. That was Fame on the phone. She said that Doctor Martin got your message. He's on his way over. His pulse is down to 38. Slowing down with every second. Dr Martin is here. Hello, Dr Martin. - Hello, sir. My goodness, what a night. It's always this way. Whenever we have a storm I can depend on at least 3 calls. Tonight I had 4. There is still Mrs Baxter up the road with a broken leg. Quite a place you have here, Professor Mueller. It looks like you have everything I'll need. Things we have to have in an emergency. I should have said everything I would have needed. I've tried everything I could think of. Purgative, adrenaline. No reaction. I'll make the necessary arrangements. Is there a telephone? There is one in the foyer. - Would you mind getting my office? The night number is Desert 525. Yes, sir. I suppose they'll have another case for me. Mrs Baxter with the broken leg. Is there anything else we can do, doctor? It would be a great help, professor. If you'd fill out this death certificate. Alright, doctor. And bring it to my office in the morning. Gladly. Thank you, professor. Goodnight. Goodnight, Dr Martin. Well, do the best you can. It will take them a while to get here. - We'll wait for them, doctor. Goodnight. - Goodnight. The brain is still alive. - That's impossible. Look for yourself. Look at the waves. Look at the pulse. A reaction. It is alive. A perfect specimen. It will be a perfect opportunity. What? Why not? Haven't I been waiting for a human brain to prove my theory? Haven't you waited for a chance to prove the possibilities of the encephalograph? Or did you intend it to be a parlor game, huh? Are you mad? Why, it would be criminal. My dear Cory, I'm not suggesting murder. The man is already dead. Dr Martin declared him dead. But it is due time for us to make the experiment. So, sterilize the instruments. Sterilize? What for? The man is dead. I said, sterilize the instruments. I thought that Dr Martin might need me. I want some instruments sterilized please. Where is Dr Martin? He's not here. He's gone. Professor Mueller is trying to do a .. A little surgery. Small, medium and large. Two scalpels. Three hemostats. The gigli saw. Is it a head injury? I said gigli saw. Is he alive? Patrick. You didn't answer my question. No Janice, he is not alive. If you try to solve the mysteries of nature .. It doesn't matter whether you experiment with guinea pigs or human beings. Instruments. Instruments! What time is it, Cory? Three-thirty. Janice. Tell Mrs Fame to make some strong, black coffee, will you please. Well? They would like some strong, black coffee. Oh, that reminds me. Fill this out Cory, will you. Death certificate? Why yes. Dr Martin left it. Who is going to sign it? Martin, of course. All you got to do is fill it out. Injuries. Abdominal .. Thorax .. and basal skull fracture. Cause of death, internal haemorrhage. Don't you realize what you did is against the law? It is illegal. Don't you realize it's what we did? We? Who was this man? Let's see. Donovan. Initials? William H. William H. Donovan. So you think it's just a case of getting Dr Martin to sign a death certificate. Do you? No. It could never be that simple. Not now. Because you, my dear professor Mueller. I beg your pardon .. "we" .. Have just stolen the most illustrious brain in the entire country. The brain of William H. Donovan. My goodness, I can't believe it yet. I never thought I'd live to see the day .. When I declared the great William H. Donovan dead. Yes, you're quite a celebrity, Dr Martin. I don't like it a bit. Newspaper reporters calling all morning. People asking questions. Well doctor, I know you're a busy man and .. As there is nothing else we can do .. - No, there is something else. Mr Donovan's wife and his attorney are in the waiting room. They'd like to ask you a few questions. Of course. Another reporter, I'll venture. Excuse me. Hello? I am professor Mueller. This is my assistant, Mr Cory. - How do you do? Well, I am Eugene Fulton, Mr Donovan's attorney. This is Mrs Donovan, gentlemen. How do you do. - How do you do, Mrs Donovan. I understand from Dr Martin .. That it was you who braved that storm to bring Mr Donovan from the plane. Yes. I want to thank you. Both of you. For everything you did for my husband. I regret we were unable to do more. Well apparently there was nothing more that could be done. We have received Mr Donovan's wallet and his personal possessions. Since you were the last persons to see him alive. We wanted to know if .. Did Mr Donovan say anything before he died? I mean, did he leave a final message? He was in a complete coma when we found him. And he never for one second regained consciousness. Is there anything else we can do? No. Thank you. Mister Cory. - Yes? Just one little point I'd like to clear up if you don't mind. Yes, of course. The death certificate states Mr Donovan died of an internal haemorrhage. That's right. Well naturally, I went to the morgue to identify Mr Donovan's body. Under the head bandages .. I noticed that a trepanation of the skull had been performed. Why? You see, the certificate .. The certificate enumerates all of Mr Donovan's known injuries. Among them, a basal skull fracture. As well as the cause of his death. Dr Martin who signed the certificate is the district physician. He is the only party in authority who can give any other information. I see. - Come on, Cory. Goodbye, Mr Fulton. Well? Cory seems to know something. Something that professor Mueller won't let him tell. Oh nonsense, Gene. If W.H. did say something before he died .. Why would they want to keep it a secret from us? That's one of the things I want to find out. What do you say we miss the plane? A few hours more in Phoenix might prove very interesting. Alright. Janice. You haven't been in the lab all day. Patrick, let's get away from here. Just as we're starting the great experiment? The great experiment? You don't want to be a part of that. I didn't hesitate being a part of it last night. Why should I run out now? You wouldn't be running out. He can't stop you from going. I won't let him. Janice, what's the matter with you? We're not in the clutches of a great monster. After all, professor Mueller has everything he wants. Encephalograph. Donovan's brain. Why should he keep me from leaving? - Oh no. Professor Mueller doesn't have everything he wants. Perhaps I didn't understand what you were trying to tell me last night. It couldn't be love. His sense of possession. Compared to what happens on the outside of the laboratory. The experiment is a pretty dull thing. Janice, we're getting out of here. - Oh, Patrick. Not abruptly of course, but as soon as we can. I think I'll go in there now and start breaking the news gently. "Cory entered the laboratory." "With every intention of telling professor Mueller." "Of his decision to leave." "But Mueller's absorbed manner caused him to hesitate." "And as he waited for an opportunity to speak." "His own interest in the encephalograph." "Was again aroused by the fact that the lines on the paper were strong." "The brain was alive." "Curiously, Cory watched." "Then his curiosity turned to fascination." "That same fascination erased all thought of Janice." "And bored deep into his scientific mind." "Intriguing his undying ambition to be at least partly responsible." "For an important contribution to science." [ Banging noises ] [ Door creaking noise ] Patrick. I heard a noise. As I came down, someone was just closing the door. [ Dogs howling! ] There is nothing. But I saw that door close. Probably Mrs Fame taking a midnight walk. I'm afraid. I tell you it is nothing. Oh, not because of that. I'm afraid of just being here. Did you say anything to professor Mueller about going away? I'm not going, Janice. And don't you leave, either. Don't ever leave. I heard a noise outside, so I called Patrick. I went out and took a look around. Oh, is that all? I thought someone was tampering with the brain. Goodnight, Janice. Were you in the house? I was in the professor's laboratory. - Well, what did you find out? Proof. They've stolen the brain. I'm going to call the police. - No, dear. That would be stupid. Stupid? What do you expect me to do? I expect you to remember what the rest of the world doesn't know yet. That the fabulously wealthy William H. Donovan left you without a dime. But you were so sure that there was money hidden away. I am sure, dear. That's the reason we can't take a chance in notifying the police yet. This experiment of professor Mueller's might be successful. And if it is .. we'll have everything we want. The whole things sounds fantastic. - It is fantastic. Almost as fantastic as the life and death of William H. Donovan. Hello. Hello, Patrick. Supplies for the experiment? Yes, I was lucky. I got everything we need. Hey. You even look beautiful in a riding coat. Thank you. Oh. We had a date to go riding, didn't we. We did. Two hours ago. Sorry, Janice. Did you get the glass prism? Yes I did, and the lamp also. Out in the wagon. Good. "Professor Mueller and Cory worked with growing intensity." "And because of Cory, Janice stayed on." "Showing an interest, but only for Mueller's benefit." "Silently, she seemed to be trying to protect Cory .." "From being entirely lost in his increasing enthusiasm." "The two men measured the brain's activity with an electric bulb." "When the light glowed it indicated the brain was awake." "When dark, the brain was asleep." "Thus they observed from seven to eight hours at a time." "The brain did not show any reaction." "But during the remaining hours." "And strangely enough .. at night." "It was most active." Look. Look at the light. - Oh, for the love of Mike. The light is always brighter at night. That's what we can't figure out. I'm sorry, Janice. I'm sorry. It's alright, Patrick. Yes, it is strange. Now if we only knew something of Donovan's habits. We could do some research on the man. - Good. Call up the Excelsior Clipping Bureau. Have them send us every word that's ever been printed about William H. Donovan. Here it is. Here is the reason. In this interview, Mr W. H. Donovan said. "It has always been my habit to use part of the day for sleep." "Because I work better when the rest of the city has retired." "In those still, fallow hours after midnight." This explains what you wanted to know, doesn't it? That explains the light. The other question still remains. To find ways and means of communication with the brain. Almost human. It seems to feel. - Almost? It does feel. It even seems to tell us something. If we could only find a way to understand its message. No, Patrick. Please .. you've gone too far already. Stop now? Why do you think we went into this experiment, huh? You know, if we could figure out a way to contact the brain through .. Morse code. What makes you think Donovan knew Morse code, huh? I don't know whether he did or not. It can be taught. A brain that can think and learn. And even if it could understand .. How could it answer us if we can't decipher these waves? That's right. There is no way of decoding. What about .. Telepathy? Telepathy? Why yes. It is not impossible. We know positively that each human brain produces and discharges microwaves. Which travel through the medium of air. Until they reach other brains in a receptive state. On the same principle as radio waves sent by a transmitter. Are received by radio sets. Yes, but .. How could we apply that theory to this? If we could strengthen the brain. Overfeed it, so to say. The electricity output would increase. Which would favor telepathic transmission. But I still say. How could we apply it? With a medium. Someone who .. Would be able to make his own mind an .. Absolute blank. In that case. Donovan's thoughts might transmit themselves. "Cory had reached the stage in his work .." "Where he felt he was being driven on by something stronger than himself." "Night after night, he would stay on in the laboratory." "Long after Mueller had retired." "Finally he moved a cot into the room." "So that he might remain constantly near the experiment." "Between fitful hours of sleep, he worked feverishly." "One night." "Discouraged by the slow increase of the chemical and tissue changes." "He deliberately overfed the brain." "With enriched blood plasma." "And then .. he watched." "Hopefully." "Waiting." "It was that very night Patrick Cory received his first message." "From Donovan's brain." "Donovan." "W." "H." "Donovan." "W." "H." "Donovan." "W." "H." "Donovan." "W." "H." "Donovan." "W." "H." "Donovan." "W." "H." "Donovan." "W.H. Donovan." Good morning, Mrs Fame. - Good morning. For Mr Cory? - Yes. Patrick! Patrick! Wake up. Janice. Look, I contacted the brain. Of course it was written by me. But it's exactly the signature of W.H. Donovan. Don't you see the scrawl, the hard "H", and the flourish on the end? And you've written it with your left hand. But still that isn't sufficient proof .. That it was Donovan's brain that influenced you telepathically. You and I happen to have read that Donovan was left handed. And you have seen his signature in facsimile in some magazines. So therefore it could be auto-suggestion or self-hypnosis. Patrick. What professor Mueller is trying to tell you is that .. Your imagination. Is running away with you. That's what you asked him to tell me. No Patrick, that isn't it. - Please Janice, don't say any more. It's obvious you don't want to help. So please go away and leave me alone. "Federal." "Prison." "Federal." "Prison." "Federal." "Prison." "Federal." "Prison." "Federal." "Prison." "Federal." "Prison." Patrick has gone. I've got to stop him. Perhaps he received another telepathic message. Please do something. I put some morphine into the blood stream. It will stop the brain activity for quite some time. Patrick. What happened? Darling, where were you going? I was going to Los Angeles. Federal prison. Federal prison? Why, you must have been dreaming. I have to go to Federal prison. But why? What will you do there? Janice, try to understand. There was a voice. Or maybe it wasn't a voice. I don't know what it was. It something like an order. I have to go. - You must stop this experiment. You tell professor Mueller to take care of the brain. Patrick. I'm not going back with you. Take me with you. Janice. Professor Mueller will need a new assistant more than ever. Yes. No doubt he does. So it's about time I showed some interest. In that experiment. Mrs Donovan will see you in the library. Oh, Mr Cory. I'm so glad to see you. - How do you do, Mrs Donovan. Please sit down. - Thank you. Cigarette? - No thank you. I suppose you've read the papers? - Yes, I have. It is absurd the ridiculous things they are saying about Mr Donovan. Mrs Donovan, I .. I've had something on my mind that I think you should know about. Yes? It's about Mr Donovan's last words. Then he did say something? Yes. There were two words he kept repeating. Two words? "Federal. Prison." Oh. That place has no significance for me. But let me call Mr Fulton. Perhaps he has an explanation. Excuse me, please. "Therefore, I find it impossible to give you a definite answer at this moment." "I'm going east today." I don't know how long he's staying, but I'll try to find out. Yes, I will take care of it. Goodbye, Gene. "On my return, I'll discuss your letter at a meeting of the board of directors." I apologize, Mrs Donovan. When I saw the Dictagraph, I .. Had the temptation to hear your husband's voice again. I can understand, Mr Cory. I spoke to Mr Fulton. - Yes? He has no explanation to offer. Well, I'm sorry I bothered you, Mrs Donovan. Goodbye. Mr Cory. - Yes? Are you going to be in town for a while? Just a couple of days. Why not have dinner with Mr Fulton and me tomorrow evening? We'll pick you up at your hotel. Shall we say at 7:30? Thank you, ma'am. At 7:30. Goodbye. - Goodbye. Yes? "Ready with your call from Phoenix, Mr Cory. Just a moment, please." Thank you. Hello, Janice? This is Mrs Fame. "Mrs Fame, this is Mr Cory. May I speak to Miss Farrell please?" I'll call her. [ Door knocks ] Yes? Mr Cory is on the phone. Patrick? Hello darling - "I was just writing you a letter." "I didn't know where to send it, but .." I'm coming home tomorrow. Oh, that's wonderful. Did everything come out alright? I'll tell you all about it when I see you. I should be there about noon. Don't leave now. In the middle of the night. Please. "I thought you wanted me to come home." Oh yes. Yes, I do. You know that. "But you must be careful." - "I will, darling." "Goodbye." - "Goodnight." "Operator." Operator. I was just talking to Los Angeles. I was cut off. Hello? I have just heard your plans. It seems you are willing to sacrifice everything we have been working for. Are you coming home now? Well, I did have a chance to hear Donovan's voice over the Dictagraph. And it was the same voice I heard last night. That was all. I haven't been able to contact the brain since. No wonder. I administered some morphine to the brain after you left. Naturally, it was in no condition to contact you. In fact, it is still sleeping soundly. Well in that case, I hadn't better hurry home. It would be only fair if you could stay at least another 24 hours. You will give the brain a chance to contact you again. Janice is expecting me. I had better let her know. Don't worry. I will explain everything to Janice. And call me if you have any news. Alright, Cory .. good luck. And goodnight. "National." "Trust." "Bank." "National." "Trust." "Bank." "1." "2." "5." "3." "1." "Ace." "Of." "Spades." "Window." "16." National Trust Bank. 1-2-5-3-1 Ace of Spades. Window 16. 1-2-5-3-1. That's not a signature. It is. I'll take it in thousand dollar bills. One moment please. The manager wants to see you please. Alright. My name is Phipps. - I'm Patrick Cory. This is Mr Manning. Would you mind answering a few questions, Mr Cory? Is there anything wrong with that check? - No. We've compared this number with the original which stands for the signature. It is correct. Also, the Ace of Spades in the corner. And you Mr Cory, opened this account? It seems so. Could I see your identification, please? This account has puzzled the bank for years. Five years ago we received a large sum of money. With the order to open an account. This is the first check that has been drawn against it. Well Mr Phipps, this is Patrick Cory. Give me the money. I'm in a hurry. - You want it in $1,000 bills? In $1,000 bills. All the $50,000? - All of it. "The same strange impulse that forced him to go to the bank." "Sign a check with a peculiar signature." "Take money that wasn't his." "Now held Cory captive as he walked along." "What should he do with the money?" "He tried to blot out his own thoughts so that the brain would prompt him." "And then quite suddenly, it did." "Instead of crossing a street, Cory saw himself treading in another direction." Mr Cory. I didn't expect the pleasure of your company until this evening. Sorry, I haven't time for social obligations. I came here strictly on business. Sit down, won?t you. What can I do for you? I understand you're a very shrewd man, Mr Fulton. Well, a lawyer has to be. I want you get a man out of Federal prison. That sort of thing isn't so easy. - I know. This will help. I don't operate the way you seem to think, Mr Cory. Then I'll have to get another lawyer. Very well. But don't you want me to tell me first whose case it is you wish me to handle? "Roger Collins." Collins? That man has been convicted of murder and sentenced to death. It's hopeless. Money is no object. Well I must know more about this. What's your interest in the case? Strictly personal. All you have to do is follow my instructions. I can't make a decision now. You'll have to give me time to think it over. Alright. Tomorrow morning. I want to see Collins. Can you arrange it? I'll try. - I said arrange it! Report to me again tomorrow. Have Roger Collins brought to my office. Surprising that an attorney like Eugene Fulton would take such a hopeless case. Did he say that he was? No, but .. - Then why do you say that? The arrangements for your visit were made through his office. You have no right to assume that he's taking over the Collins case. Why, I .. Roger. This is Mr Cory. Hello Roger. I don't know you. You don't ..? No, of course you don't. I don't want to see any psychiatrists, pathologists or whatever you're called. I don't want to see any more of you. But I want to help you, Roger. Sure. That's what they all say. My lawyer tells them to say that. He is trying to prove I'm insane now. But you're not! You're not guilty either. You believe me? Somehow I can tell you .. You do believe me. I've always known you were innocent. Then why didn't you help me before? Why didn't you stop 'em sending me here? - It's not too late, Roger. Is there anything you can tell me that you didn't tell them at the trial? No .. why should there be? I've never lied. I was always honest. Can't anyone ever understand that I didn't murder him. I never liked him but I didn't murder him. Who didn't you like, Roger? - My stepfather of course. Who do ..? So that's it. You're a psychiatrist after all. - No. You're trying to trip me up with misleading questions. No! - Yes, you are. You're trying to make me out insane. It's that lawyer again. He doesn't think I should hang but he won't hesitate to put me in an asylum. Tell him I won't go. I don't want to go. I'd rather be dead. For the kind of tricks you pull. I wish you were dead, too. His stepfather. What did you say, Mr Cory? I'm just trying to remember something. Thank you, Warden. Not at all. See, it is a hopeless case. "His mission had failed." "But from this moment on." "Donovan's brain took possession of him without respite." "As Cory walked along, the voice came to him." "Urging, demanding." "Echoing back from the stony walls of the prison corridor." "He is innocent." "Save him." "He is innocent." "Save him." "He is innocent." "Save him." "He is innocent. Save him." Hello? Patrick. I'm so glad I found you. You mustn't come back to the castle now. Wait for me. Don't annoy me with your stupid ideas. Let me talk to Mueller. I don't want you to talk to him. Anyway, he's locked himself in the laboratory. And I know he keeps feeding the brain. "Giving it more and more .. so that .." Patrick! What are you doing? - I turned it off. The brain is dead. Patrick is free. Patrick is free! So you thought you could stop the brain. Kill it .. by merely turning off the current, didn't you. The idea wasn't bad. Although your intent was malicious. But look. Look! What you unintentionally made me discover. Just look at the bulb. It is glowing. The brain is alive. Awake. And working. Independent of electric current. Self-sufficient. You mean .. nothing can stop it? Nothing but the physical destruction of its very substance. Physical destruction? Please let me! I want Patrick to be free. I don't. Why should I? You .. monster! Your things are in the car. Hurry. You mean ..? You gave me the key too? - Yes. Get out of here. Hurry! Why are you so determined to establish Collins' innocence? I'm not paying you to ask questions. What are you going to do about this case? Well, I've been doing some research. I've found several witnesses that might prove difficult. One in particular. I believe they called her the "star witness" at the trial. Who was it? It was this child, 13 or 14 years old. She lives next door to the house where the murder occurred. But she came forth with some very damaging testimony against Collins. Give her parents some money and tell them to take her over the state line. But you can't bribe people to do that. You can't pervert justice. You just can't. I can. I can by anything! I don't want the girl found until Collins is freed. Mr Cory. What is Roger Collins to you? I told you I wasn't paying you to ask questions. That is my privilege. Mr Fulton, what did you say the name of the star witness was? Oh yes, Mr Cory. I'll tell you the whole story. The morning Collins killed poor Mr Howard .. Don't say "killed", Mary Lou. - But he did, grandmother. He came out of the house, looked around. Lit a cigarette. He sneaked away. He thought no-one saw him. But I did. I see everything. How come? When I'm grown up, I'm going to be a detective. You know, they are hiring girls now. - Imagine. Mr Cory, the crazy ideas the young folks get these days. When I was young we thought of other things. Why not? She might make a very clever detective. Now, there is one thing I must say for Mary Lou, she has an amazing memory. Why only just yesterday, she remembered something else. What was it? Well .. after he stood there and lit his cigarette. He picked a flower and stuck it in his buttonhole. Why didn't you tell that to the prosecuting attorney? I was just telling you. She only just remembered it yesterday. That's what the girl told. That makes her our star witness. I ask you, would a murderer after committing such a crime, stop .. And pick a flower for his buttonhole? In a premeditated murder, it has been done. Not Collins. He's not the type. How can anyone tell what's going on inside a man's brain? Are you his lawyer or a prosecuting attorney? It's a new clue and a sound one. Anyway, it gives us a chance to reopen the trial. Look, Corey. This can be used as evidence against Collins. It may mean something. But as evidence for him? Believe me, it means very little. I just gave you another $5,000 and I'm not paying for nothing. I want action. I'm working on it. But I must use my own methods. Now, tonight a Mr Grimes will call on you. He can be trusted. Follow his advice. [ Door knocks ] Come in. Patrick. Why did you come here? What do you want? How can you say that when you need me so much. I don't need you. I don't need anybody. How can I help you? What can I do? You can't do anything. Get out! I have tried to destroy the brain but .. Professor Mueller .. [ Telephone ] Yes? - "Mr Grimes to see you." Send him up. Who is it? Stop asking so many questions. Go on in there. Go on! [ Door knocks ] Come in. Mr Cory? Yes, I'm Patrick Cory. - Well, well, well. Mr Cory, let's get down to business. Now let's see what we have here. Yes, murder. First degree. Circumstantial evidence. On star witness. Well, well, well. - That's nothing new. Mr Cory, I am a man of few words. If you want him free, I'm the man. You want quick action? You get it from me. What do you suggest? The opening of the trial. Bribe the witnesses. Helping the jurors make up their minds. All together. One hundred thousand dollars. Fifty on deposit and fifty on acquittal. I'll have to talk to Fulton first. It can only be done through me. Mr Fulton is a lawyer and a public figure. He gives the anaesthetic, I pull the teeth. A hundred thousand is okay on delivery. Not one cent down. Well .. it's been knowing you, Mr Cory. I can understand your feelings. Money is a hard thing to fight about. Oh. You can get a funeral for Collins as low as $65 from Kelly Bros on Santa Vista. Good day. - Wait a minute. Oh, no hurry. I'll give you time to make up your mind. You talk to Fulton tomorrow. Is this you who is doing all these terrible things? It can't be. Patrick. Can't you see you're beginning to think like Donovan? It's just like being hypnotised. Wake up. Please wake up. So you've been listening, huh? That's why you came here. To interfere, wasn't it? I came here to help you. And that is what I'm going to do. Somehow. I .. forgot my pencil. Goodbye. Hello? Mrs Fame? I must talk to professor Mueller. He won't come to the phone. He won't talk to anyone. But it's been impossible for me to even reason with Mr Cory. I've thought of going to the police. But I'm afraid of what might happen. Oh please, Mrs Fame. Please. I have got to make professor Mueller understand. It's too late now, Miss Farrell. He won't even see me. He keeps the door locked. I think the brain is beginning to take possession of professor Mueller too. Your sudden interest in Miss Farrell's welfare is most touching, Mrs Fame. But you wouldn't tell her the real reason for your interest, would you. You won't tell her you've been jealous of her since the day she arrived here. And that you've tried to get rid of her ever since until you finally succeeded. You old .. malicious .. jealous fool! Ah, perfect timing, darling. Not on your part. I had these ready fifteen minutes ago. Grimes is a little late. However, everything is coming along splendidly. He'll pay? - Oh yes, and he'll pay more. Are you really reopening the trial? - Certainly. But what if Collins proves innocent? - It will never come to that. A young lady has arrived. - A young lady? Grimes seems to think it's Cory's fianc?e. Will she complicate matters? - Oh no, on the contrary. Strange. The man in the possession of Donovan's brain .. Doesn't know that the boy about to die is Donovan's own son. I want results! I've paid Grimes all the money he wants. Now I want action. I can't understand how a man with your background can lose balance so easily. Have you seen the morning papers? - No. - Well, look at that. It's alright for a beginning. However there is a hitch. Yeah, new hitch, new money. - Not talking about money. I have trouble with one of the witnesses. Which one? - The star witness. Mary Lou? - Exactly. She is the one that will introduce the new evidence. Sure. But not evidence for Collins. You see Cory, I told you that evidence can work both ways. Now you thought the incident with the flower will establish Collins innocence. As a matter of fact, it clearly works against him. Why? It was Collins habit to wear a flower in his lapel every day. Without it he would have been conspicuous. So you can understand why he picked one that particular day. The child is no help at all. What about the other witness? 1,2,3,4,5. They're alright. The sixth is the child. That was Mr Cory. Yes. I know. But you said you were waiting to see him. I've changed my mind. I want to see Mr Fulton. Immediately. What is your name please? Janice Farrell. Miss Janice Farrell to see Mr Fulton. "Send her in." - Yes, Mr Fulton. Go right in, Miss Farrell. - Thank you. We've met before, Miss Farrell. Oh. So you are Mr Fulton? No. I'm Mr Grimes. But .. - Please, sit down. Miss Farrell. I'm talking for Mr Fulton and for a good reason. Mr Fulton's reputation as a lawyer is beyond reproach. So, when things get slightly out of balance he .. Prefers me to take over. I have really no idea of Mr Cory's dealings with Mr Fulton. Just that I .. - I thought so. Mr Fulton thought so too. You don't know anything. But we know about everything. And what is "everything", Mr Grimes? What has Mr Cory done? - What has he done? First, he's guilty of stealing a man's brain. Laudable for science but punishable by law. Second. Trying to get a murderer acquitted by influencing witnesses. Possible sentence: five years. Third. Using Mr Donovan's funds by falsifying his signature. Another five years. Burt he is innocent. That's the point. He's acting under Donovan's influence. Miss Farrell, I know you love Mr Cory. And you want to save him. All we want is money. Now .. here is a blank check. We would like to get Mr Donovan's secret signature. The one that Mr Cory has used quite frequently in the past few days. If we get the money .. All of it, well .. You can take Mr Cory home and everything will be forgotten. Patrick can't do that. He wouldn't do it. He isn't a criminal. - That's what you think. But I know differently. You go now and don't let him out of your sight for a moment. Otherwise, you'll not only have criminal as a sweetheart. But also a murderer. I don't believe it. I don't believe a word you've said. You're lying. You were afraid of it all the time and that's why you came here. You just said he'd murder. Patrick wouldn't. No, Patrick wouldn't. But Donovan would. Donovan? A man who can murder once, won't hesitate to do it again. I want you to come with me. I said come with me. - Where to? Where are we going? I want you to meet someone. Just in time. I don't see anyone. You will. Wait. Who? Mary Lou. There she is now. Bye, Jim. Bye Jane. See you tomorrow. Bye. That smart little girl that observes everything. The bright little girl that wants to be a detective when she grows up. The clever little girl that .. That's the last time you'll ever get in my way. You're trying to hang him too, and he's innocent. Patrick, don't you remember who you are? You're conspiring with Fulton. Fulton is conspiring with Grimes. You're all in my way. You're all my enemies. We're not your enemies. You saw the world in the wrong focus. You believe people are against you. That was not true. Believe me. It was just an obsession, Patrick. I'm not that! Help! Help .. help! Help .. help! Janice. Patrick, you're free. I'm not free. Take me back to the castle. You see. Fulton always knew that Collins was innocent. So does Mrs Donovan. They didn't want another heir .. Because in the event they could use Donovan's secret account. Another heir? Yes. You see, Collins was Donovan's son by a former marriage that .. He didn't tell anybody about. Well Howard knew, because Howard acted as .. Collins' foster father. And who is Howard? - The murdered man. He was Donovan's secretary and knew all about his .. Secret account. So it must have been Donovan who actually committed the murder. But why did Donovan kill Howard? Well, he wrote the life story of Donovan and Donovan didn't want it published. Well, he made him an offer. Howard turned it down. Patrick. Here we are. Alright, darling. He's asleep. What about the brain? Professor Mueller has put the brain asleep. Not professor Mueller. I used all the morphine he had. What time? About two o'clock this afternoon. That was .. But Patrick, if the brain is asleep that means .. It means it's time to put an end to it. No, Mr Cory. Not yet. Not when we are so close to success. I don't want any more. I've had enough. It isn't a question of what you want. Your little experience in Los Angeles was just the start of our experiment. It's your experiment. You are the one who .. Please, please. I want to be free. I want to be free to live my own life. Yes, free to be with Janice. Yes, yes. - No. Patrick! "And so the four who had shared the most amazing adventure." "Finally found its conclusion." "For professor Mueller, such a death was well-deserved." "He had tried to distort an experiment of science." "Into ? diabolical plot to further his own personal gain." "Following a brief trial, Mrs Fame was acquitted." "But Patrick Cory, although he helped to free Roger Collins." "Was obliged to serve ? short term in prison for his part in the experiment." "However, Janice was waiting." "So after all, there was a happy ending to his experiment." * steve d * * steve d *
