Hey! I did it to eat! Shame on you. If you do it at all, plan something big. What would a plain drifter do? How could you ask me that? You got me mixed up in this. Sorry. It's too late to apologize! Robbing a gambling parlor is punishable by death. That's the law! What's the matter? Are you shaking? -What? Hey, look! They're coming. Can't we get away from them? Well, no. We just have to fight! I never thought I would die a disgraceful death. I'm not going to die. Not with a poor samurai! Bearing some hardship, I have set off on a long journey! Anyway, here goes! Hey, Haru-bo. What are you doing? Hey! Haru-bo! Come on! Damnfool..! What's so funny, you idiot? I'm starving. I can't move! -Damn you! We're within a hair's breadth of dying! I hear a horse! Come on! Let's go! Samurai-san! Return this horse to Gohei. He lives in Yagiri Village! -Got it! Thank you! Hey, come quickly! What's wrong? Your wallet? I think I lost it at the gambling parlor. What are you looking at? The ocean. What's out there on the ocean? Nothing. My father was abducted. Abducted? But I know he's alive! He'll come back from across the ocean! I'm sure he will! Your mother..? I don't have a mother. Nobody's around. I see. You said your dad was abducted. Who did it? Sanshu-ya. Who is Sanshu-ya? My dad borrowed money from him. What's the name of this village? Yagiri Village. Where is the house of Gohei? No. Don't. I'm an honest man. Can't you accept it because it was stolen from a gambling parlor? -Quit it! Leave him alone. He's an honest man. You're right. I will just say thanks. -If you want to say thanks, then say it to the girl. Her name is Haru. Kiju is her father. He's a fisherman. -Thank you. -Bye. -Hey guys! Don't stay there too long. It's a rough neighborhood. Hey. Not that close. So you said you bear a burden of some sort? -It's none of your business. Me too. I also have a purpose for my trip. Hey, where are you going now? That's my business. I don't want you to be around. Get away from me! I'll kill you! Alright. But let me just identify myself. I am... -I don'g wang go hear ig. You could be just another jinx. FOOD AND SAK? WE BUY SAK? Hey, mister! Are you just a stranger? Or an ex-convict? Neither. So what? You seem to have both skill and courage. But, aren't you starving, 'Drifting Crow'..? If you need some food, get it over there. At Sanshu-ya Namizo's. WAREHOUSE - HUMAN LABOR Sanshu-ya'S Osei told him to come here? Tell me, who the hell is he?! -He said he was a drifter. Alright. Tell him to take his shoes off. -Yes, sir. Hey, Namizo. You must be lucky to have such a sweet sister. Thank you. But my business depends on you two, Shima-ya-san and Aoga-ya. No, not us, but your sister, Osei. Right? Aoga-ya, you are cynical as usual. The government official told me he was jealous of you, Shima-ya. He was jealous because you are entitled to enjoy Osei day and night. Namizo, a ship will arrive from Sado Island in a couple of days. Can you get more people? Most workers from nearby villages have already been called on duty. Can you find some strong young men for me? Well, I could find some, but... -Don't be lax, Namizo-san. Show no mercy to anyone you lent money to. Boss, a group of farmers are running away from the village! Hey, 'boys'. Get dressed! -Yes, sir! -Yes, sir!-Yes, sir! -Yes, sir!-Yes, sir! -Yes, sir! Hey, guest. Come help! How can I help you? -We're going to hunt workers. -Hunt workers? Zenji, Hikosuke, and Bishomon. You all look miserable. What's the matter? Boss, the devil must have been in the dice. He shot the dice and our purses emptied in a second. You would suffer if you catch a cold in summer, you know. I'm afraid I can't visit a prostitute for a while. -You idiots! 'Oyabun'-san! You must be their boss. I appreciate the hospitality your men have shown me. It's okay. So what's your name? Ipponmatsu. Sanshu-ya's men are here. Hey, you! We risk our lives too! How dare you say that? You're trying to run away while in debt! Well, the elderly, such as myself, will stay here. What? We've got to run away before the ship comes! Whenever it comes, people are taken away! That's right. Workers in the nearby villages were all hunted! The only ones left were children and sick old people! Damn you! We won't let you go through! Want to use force? Very well..! You insulted us! If we lost our lives here, our fate would be the same, guys! Those who went to Sado to repay debt never came back! They were all killed! Let's run away! Run away while we can! Damn you! Hell..! If the ship comes from Sado... if it arrives, it would be too late! The ship will come to take our lives! It will come! Hey. Sister! -Ig's alrighg. -Don't make a move, or I'll kill you! Are you returning kindness with hostility? I don't mean to. Do you know them? I don't understand what's going on. Hey you, drifter! Nothing good can happen if you stay here longer. Get away from here quickly! You're probably right. What'd you say? Sanshu-ya Namizo had been a shabby local gang member until two years ago, but suddenly became rich! He started making the money fly in our neighborhood! Damn it! Maybe he's involved in illegal activities. Suddenly, two years ago? That's strange. That's going too far, Kiju! Our Oyabun really wants to marry Oharu. Don't push your luck, or you'll be sorry! Imbeciles! He offered his sister to Shima-ya, and got rich and arrogant! My daughter wouldn't get married to such a vile man! -Don't tell me you are... -Look! I gave him my ship in payment for debts! I'm paid up! Get out of here! -No, you're not! I heard you urged farmers to plan to get out of the village! Don't play innocent. We have firm proof! Under torture, Genji confessed. Hey, I believe this village has a Magistrate's office. -Shut up! -Both Magistrate and constables were bribed and became powerless! There is neither samurai nor law! You're never at a loss for words! We're taking Haru! If you want to take her away, you have to win a sword match. -Have you decided to disobey? Yeah. I owe her a debt of gratitude. -Is it more important than the debt you owe according to our code? That depends. Can you defeat me? Let me make it clear, it's a one-time match. Lousy bastard! Can anyone hurry back to Shima-ya? Go fetch Washiro! Well, I will go to Shima-ya. Any objections?! Washiro-san! Washiro-san! Oh, no! Damn you! Hey, drifter! I'll kill you. A lowly ex-samurai, Yojimbo (watchdog). You kill people for pleasure, don't you? It's been a while since someone has provoked a fight. You must be Sanshu-ya's sister and Shima-ya's mistress. Boys. Back off! I owe you one, but I've decided to be a foe. You lack moral obligation to navigate the world. Idiot! Get lost quickly! -But I'm afraid I like this town. I'll stay for a while. -Do you want to be killed? No. I want to kill someone. What? Not you. The one who killed my father. The shabby local gang member who suddenly became rich. I've been looking for that kind of person. Well, give my regards to your brother. To your master too. You again, jinx!?! Kuroki Yaichiro! Halt! So what have you done? -Wrong! You got the wrong person! -We have your description! We'll listen to you in the office! Is he a wanted criminal? -No!! You got the wrong person! -Then, why do you run away? Only the guilty run! -Is that right? -Whag...? -It's none of my business. Well, have fun. -I also have a travel license! Here! I've done nothing wrong! -Anybody can geg a gravel license! Come! Hey, hey! -Shut up! Your father is a serious offender who has robbed government gold! You've left home, searching for him! You must know where he is! -You're wrong! -Come on! If you commit more crimes with a sword, you'll be sent to prison! You would damage your family's reputation once again! -My father is innocent! -Then why has he disappeared? Why? Five years ago, at Sasago Pass the men transporting 4,000 ryo of government gold were killed! But Kuroki Hanbei's body was not found! Why? He must have run away with 4,000 ryo..! What? Sasago Pass? -Wrong. He is innocent! My father is innocent! -At Sasago Pass. Five years ago. -That wasn't my father! He is innocent! -You can talk about it in the office! Hey, you! Mind your own business! Idiots! What are you doing? Go catch them! Go catch them! Why did you save me? Why? Your father killed my father! That's absurd! Five years ago at Sasago Pass. Time and place fit! Your father killed my father! I investigated the incident! My father came across the scene of the crime where Kuroki Hanbei robbed 4,000 ryo..! ''Red Scabbard'' Genshichi was popular among those who roamed the world. He went out on business, never to return! It happened to be the same day as the robbery! Six months later, his decomposed body was found! Look at his long sword. This is a remembrance! -Hold on! My father was a man of honor! This isn't true. It can't be. What are you trying to pull? The officer also said that your father would not have disappeared if he had been innocent! Among six samurai, five were killed! Your father, Kuroki Hanbei must have taken the money... and disappeared! -Wrong! It couldn't have been my father! I left home to become a man. Two years later, I went back, singing merrily like a little bird. When I got home in Kumadaira, Shinshu, my father was gone! I found this long-sword in the red scabbard! I put off on a long journey! I'm glad I finally met you! I know you're waiting for an opportunity to meet your father somewhere! Where will you meet him? Speak up! -Wrong! You're wrong! What's the matter? Stand up! Help me! -What? I don't have courage like you. Damn! It's terrible! I did great in the Dojo, but... Who cares? Where is your father? Tell me! Tell me where he is! -I don'g know. Very well...! Don't you really know it? -No, I don't! I would also like to find him and wipe away the humiliation! Well, then. Let's find him together. If he killed my father, I will kill him right away! Hey, I heard about Sanshu-ya Namizo. He lives in the village. He is a shabby henchman, but he buys officials with enormous bribes. That sounds too good to be true! He started acting arrogantly about 2 years ago when Shima-ya Jubei came. Don't you think it would make sense if Shima-ya Jubei was your father? -I don't believe it. Ridiculous! -Very well. Let's go to Shima-ya and find out. Hey, Kiju-san! Haru..! Haru was kidnapped by.. Sanshu-ya's henchmen! Sanshu-ya's men? I'll stand back and watch you act like a Samurai, repaying a debt of gratitude. You don't need swordsmanship to kill. Just courage and explosiveness. Now go! What are you doing with this girl in the middle of the day? Hey, close the door! I hope you weren't raped. Don't look at me like that! That's a relief. Who is Shima-ya Jubei? Tell me! I.. I know.. nothing about it! -I will force you to confess with this sword! This samurai is Kuroki Yaichiro. How about it? Do you have anything to say? You gain control of poor people by lending them money. You hunt workers! You send them to Sado Island. They're killed and left in the darkness. I don't know what is going on at Sado Island. But a weakling like you can't handle it all by yourself. Namizo, who is Shima-ya? Shima-ya is just an alias! Kuroki Hanbei is his real name! Right? My name is Ipponmatsu. I was born in Kumadaira, located at the foot of Mt. Asama in Shinshu. Unfortunately, my father ''Red Scabbard'' Genshichi, was murdered. Wait..! Wait..! I'll tell you everything I know! -I have no patience! -Waig! Lisgen go me! Two years ago, Shima-ya came to me and asked me to obey. So I le..lent money t..to the farmers and fishermen. How did Shima-ya get his money? That I don't know... -Damn you! Why don't you confess? -Lisgen! Shima-ya had an excuse! There was someone behind him... Damn it! There! That's Shima-ya Jubei! No! That's not my father! Don't let them go! He killed Namizo! Spread out! Find them! What are we going to do now? It's not safe to leave now. Wait until sunset. We'll leave then. But where? There is a lodge in the mountain. A charcoal burner's lodge that belonged to my childhood friend. He's a drifter, looking for the man who killed his father. Is that right, Uncle? Yeah. Your father won't come home either. I told him the truth. Giving him false hope would be much more cruel. Why was Sanshu-ya Namizo killed? Namizo was about to disclose whatever Shima-ya is hiding. Namizo said, ''There is someone behind Shima-ya.'' -It could be your father. -You said it again! -Hold on ghere! Do you have something against each other? Don't cause internal discord. Let's hide in the mountain. Sometimes, patience can help and enemies may show up. Shima-ya killed Namizo, but is now leading his funeral. That's crazy. He puts on a convincing act. Since he moved here two years ago, nearby villages turned into ghost towns. Plants and land would all be dried up in the end. Mokubei-san, have you heard about a ringleader who is directing Shima-ya? Well... What about Kuroki Hanbei? He's a samurai. He must be hiding his identity, though. I know nothing about it. Drink or eat? I'd like to eat. Tell Kiju that I will bring him some rice and sak?. -Okay. We've been friends since we were little. We were wild when we were kids. But it seems that Kiju found hidden treasure. Haru is his treasure, you know. Well. She is cute. I like her. Do you love her? -No. Drifters don't fall in love with women. It doesn't work. I guess your parents couldn't handle you. But, you should settle down! Well, I miss fighting with my folks. They're dead. Stop roaming the land and settle down. Otherwise, your life will be on the road with no place to call home, you know? That was my father's life exactly. He was slain by a passer-by. I, Shima-ya Jubei will take over Sanshu from today. Therefore, you all work at my place. Any objections? -No, sir! -No, sir!-No, sir! -No, sir!-No, sir! -No, sir! In 5 days, a ship will arrive from Sado Island. We'll assemble all the farmers who have tried to run away. But we are still short of workers. If we can't get enough workers from nearby villages, shall we call some in this village? That's a good idea. What should we do with Ipponmatsu who killed Namizo? Well, let Magistrate Aoga take care of it. Thank you for accepting the task. I wonder if Kuroki Yaichiro is with him. Kuroki? Ah, the man whose father robbed the government gold and disappeared. If we caught Yaichiro, we would kill two birds with one stone. Old man, I'd like another glass of cold sak?! I'm still okay. I understand how you feel. But, the drinking, Osei-san? I'm acting disgracefully on the day of my brother's funeral. But I can't help it. I'm curious about Sanshu-ya's future. His henchmen will all move to Shima-ya. Oh..! Is that so? I'm sorry I asked a stupid question. -That's alright. Now that my brother is dead, I can leave Shima-ya. I don't know about that. You are so beautiful. I don't think Shima-ya will ever let you go. Well, well..! What are you talking about? Mokubei! Why are you closed? The master of Sanshu-ya was killed today. I don't want his henchmen to come here and get drunk. Hey! What? Bring some sak?for me. Yes. With all the windows closed, it's too hot in here. I agree with you completely. Completely agree? Well, make the sak?to go. I decided to drink at home. -Okay. Do you think you can make a clean break with Shima-ya? I am going to! Well. Sure, I've slept with him, but never felt love. Is that so? Right. If I hadn't become his mistress, I would have been tortured. My brother cried at his yakuza rite-of-passage to manhood. The same was true with me. Well, I wasn't in love, any way. You sound like you are now. That's enough! Can you really make a clean break with him? You slept with him so many times that you can't leave him any more. Women are like pigs...! Here you are. Are you all right? I'm fine. I'm old. But I grew up on the sea. Ouch. Ouch. Oh, Mokubei-san. Mokubei... What are you doing? Leave me alone! Don't come upstairs! I didn't kill Namizo. Liar! I heard it was you. Washiro said so, right? In fact, he killed your brother. Washiro did it. Really? But why? -Thag's my quesgion. So tell me. Shima-ya Jubei is hiding someone, isn't he? Your brother was talking about it as he was killed by Washiro. I don't think you can forgive him. Tell me if Shima-ya is somebody's puppet. Is it Kuroki Hanbei? Come on, Osei! It's Hanbei Kuroki, isn't it? He was a samurai who killed his colleagues at Sasago Pass five years ago and disappeared with 4,000 ryo. Right? Is it him? I don't know his name. -You must know it because you are Shima-ya's mistress. Stop it! Tell me. Please! He killed my father! Is he staying at Shima-ya? If not, where? Tell me. Please. Tell me. Tell me..! Osei-san! Okay, I will. But kill Shima-ya. Kill Shima-ya... kill him and run away with me..! Please. Can you promise to do that? Very well. Then hold me. What? Just to make you promise. In order to run away from that horrible man, I have to beg you! Please take me away from Shima-ya. I'm in love with you. I had met many men, but this is my first love. Drifter! Osei-san! Run! Osei, good job! Bitch! You tricked me! -No. I... Do you feel sick? In pain? What happened? You've been sleeping. I thought you might never awaken. I see. No. Don't move. You went to the village alone. Without saying anything. You're a fool..! I don't take instructions. You're so stubborn. Right. Being stubborn and brave, I roam the world. I hate traveling 'yakuza'..! My late father would often say, ''Burn the brightest, burn the shortest... ''You have no time to fall in love with women.'' One day, I hit my father and left home. I felt great. I've been a drifter ever since. Fight after fight. Sleeping under the sky without money. After 3 days as a beggar, you remain a beggar. The same is true with drifters. Since we depend on others for food we call ourselves 'Drifting Crows'. But maybe once in a while, you seek a house to live in and a place to settle down? I once asked about that to a bird in a cage. The bird said it envied crows. You truly are a stupid crow! You mean at any cost? Right. I said I'm not coming. And I mean it. So are you in love with that 'Drifting Crow'? What if I was? I will kill both of you. Jubei-san. I will no longer be your mistress. I will be born again and leave the village. He will be back to kill you... Washiro! How about it? Won't you tell us who Ipponmatsu is? No, because I don't.. know... I wouldn't, even if.. I did... I'll run away.. with him... And.. be.. re-born... Stop that. You couldn't win even with two or three people on your side. Go somewhere else. Don't even think about revenge. Get it? I'm determined to pay back. I'll never give up! Sister! -Whag? -I like Uncle! -Do you? -I'm talking about Uncle Ipponmatsu. He's my role model. One day, I'll beat the man who killed my father, and take to the road. May I? -Tarokichi! Are you sure you haven't got it wrong? That samurai doesn't look like an evil man. Looks can be deceiving. His father disappeared because he had killed my father. What else could it be? -My father is innocent! He's innocent! Look. Your father is a thief. He's a murderer..! He doesn't deserve to be called samurai. He's an evil man! -Stop it! He killed my father. I'll find and kill him! Stop it.. or I'll kill you! Can you? Kill me, you damn coward! You bastard! Come on! I heard from Osei about an alleged mastermind behind Shima-ya. We should believe it because she was Shima-ya's mistress. Are you saying he could be my father? He must be. Five years ago at Sasago Pass. He was my dearest father. My mother died when I was small. So my father brought me up. He would say, ''Boys must be strong.'' He would hit me all the time. People criticized him for being violent. But nobody can understand how bonded we were. I've seen the man. You mean Kuroki Hanbei? -I don't know because I don't know Kuroki. But I saw the man at sea. I still owned a ship a year and half ago, you know. When I was fishing, I saw a man on the ship, sailing from Sado Island. I saw him in the distance, but he was directing people. Shima-ya was totally under his control. What did he look like? Well. It's hard to say. I heard the ship is coming in. What? Tarokichi heard about it when he went to the village. Probably, people in the village are in a panic. Whenever the ship comes, tens of lives are lost. Don't tell that samurai. I won't, even if you asked me to. Very well. Let me get through with it! It must be Kuroki Hanbei! Are you going alone? I don't want to go! No! Not me! -Show no mercy! -Easy! Or you could hurt yourself! Please take me instead of my son! -Mother is useless. Out of my way! You can come home as soon as you pay off the debt. That's not true! Liar! Liar! If you get on the ship, you'll be killed! Stupid! Osei-san! Osei-san! It's me! Ipponmatsu. Who did this to you? Was it Shima-ya? Or Kuroki Hanbei? I will leave... I will be born.. again and.. leave the village.. with my lover. Osei-san! Shima-ya... came to the village.. two years.. ago. He was... with someone, but the... man was on the ship. So I don't know him. Osei-san! Hey, Osei-san! Osei-san! Don't look at me. Don't look.. at my face. I finally.. met someone.. to fall.. in love.. with. I'm sorry. I came to the village only to cause trouble. Not what you expected, is it? Did you kill her? Washiro! I told you not to kill her! She died. You shouldn't have asked me. I'd like to see Kuroki Hanbei! My mortal enemy! I'll kill him! -Your mortal enemy? Who are you? -It's none of your business! Bring him here! Hold on! Withdraw! Washiro! Withdraw! Where is everybody? Don't hide! Kuroki Hanbei! I finally found you! Father...?! What's the matter? You have a blank look on your face. Father! You must have had a long trip. I can't believe you're still alive! So were you on Sado Island? That's correct. I can't believe it. -It's so nice to see you again. I heard that you were killed and your decomposed body was later found. -That corpse belonged to the samurai Kuroki Hanbei. What's wrong? Stop it! Stop laughing like that...!!! That, in brief, is what happened! No, that's not all! You also killed 5 samurai, you bastard! Bastard? Do you call me ''bastard''? Right. You are no longer the father whom I respected. You've become a monster. If I were a monster, then the system of the world would be a dirty great monster. Don't even think about it. It's no big deal! You weren't satisfied with the incident at Sasago Pass. You ruined people and villages as you traveled around. Can you still say it's no big deal? You've gotten so serious. You must still be half a man! Who cares? A man or half a man or whatever! Don't shout at me like that. In the past, I would shout at you and hit you. But right before you left home, you hit me for the first time. I would always remember your fist! I want to hit you now. Go ahead, hit me, little boy. Listen, little boy. It would be real easy to kill you if I decided to do so. -It may not be that easy. Well. What are we talking about? We are father and son. I never thought you would take off to look for the killer. But this is what I found out! Damn it! I didn't talk about you to anybody including Shima-ya and Namizo. I thought it was your business as a man. I thought my father was murdered. To find the killer, I've drifted from village to village for 5 years. -I'm grateful. -Silly me! You are my son. Join hands with me. I'm glad I'll be able to work with my son. What? Get over your bad mood. I couldn't be happier than if we worked together to make a profit. Come on. Do you think I'll obey? Won't you? -No, I won't! Alright. Then, we'll be strangers. You have no mercy! Nothing! All you want is money, right? You'll understand when you become my age. You'll understand that there's nothing in the world. You're still young, honest, and sincere. But, I'm afraid the world is downright crazy. Look at the samurai. They don't have money but act arrogantly, bossing farmers and common people around. However, farmers and peasants are mean too. I wanted to see how they would behave for money. Both samurai and farmers acted alike when it comes to money. All crawled on the ground, crying or laughing. It was so funny to watch them. Furthermore, I made a huge profit from the 4,000 ryo. I don't even know how much I have now. Some day, you'll go to prison and count your money. Could it be as tall as 3 'Shaku' in height? Prison? That's where I stay whenever I come to the village. It's located in the governmental office complex. Not only officers, but the entire goldmine is all under my control. Before gold is transferred to Edo and made into money, I steal some. It's risky. But it's worth it. Those workers who find the truth are killed on the ship. And more workers are sent to the Island. They are to repay a debt. I can't trust Shima-ya Jubei. He looks strong and fearsome, but formerly he was a traveler. I hired him and trained him, but he just wants to sleep with women. A stupid man! Washiro too. He's good at killing people only. Crazy fellow! I'm tired of working with them. How about it? Change your mind. Is that all you wanted to say? -What? Well. No big deal. We could be father and son; or strangers. Tomorrow morning, I'll depart with workers from over there. Think about it. I'll see you. Do you know who I'm drifting with? Kuroki Yaichiro. Kuroki Hanbei's son! My father.. has been killed... Should I express joy.. or grief.. about the news. I have to maintain 'Face'as a samurai! I apologize! I hated you. I thought you were my mortal enemy's son, and wanted to kill you in a single stroke. I think that's how you feel now. I hate you! I can't apologize enough! Do whatever you like. Go ahead! Samurai! -Uncle! Ipponmatsu. You are such a poor guy. Kuroki-san! Kuroki-san..! Kuroki-san! Kuroki-san! Hang on! -Uncle..! Don't worry! I'm not going to kill you! Why did you kill the samurai? Just to be safe! The dead can't talk! I'm still alive! You're my son, you haven't the guts to spread the truth. You'll be sorry to say that! I'll see you! No treatment necessary. Just leave it. I know I will die. Kuroki-san. I... I... That's alright. I just wish.. I could have.. shown you.. 'Samurai Spirit'... I'm sorry! Don't be sorry... Ipponmatsu-san. Your name means ''a pine tree''... It sounds lonely... But I've always been lonely too... I'm glad we became friends... Our friendship.. will be.. over soon... though. Kuroki-san! Kiju-san, please take care of everything. Are you going now? Are you going to kill your father? -Yes, I am! I've got to do it. No matter if he's my father! I've got to do it! -You would be called murderer of your own father! Kuroki-san and his father were both innocent. I feel obliged to fight in order to clear their names. Wait! Wait! Don't go! Wait! - Haru! Haru! Thank you all for your hospitality. Take care of yourself! You shouldn't go! Please don't! I have a favor to ask of you, Kiju-san. Please report the truth to the office in Edo, or wherever. Go now! All right. I'll take care of it. Kiju-san, I wish I had a father just like you. Do live long. Please don't go I...! I...! -Don't finish your sentence. I take to the road whether or not I am alive. A 'sgupid crow'should keep traveling. Haru-bo. You have such a common name. But I like it. Bye! Uncle! Uncle..! Uncle! Uncle! I heard you are our Boss's son. Would you like to join us? I came to kill my father. I heard you. We've been given an order. Wait! Let me take care of it. I'll get your head! Go ahead! Everybody! Let's go!! Are you going to kill your father? I cannot tolerate what you, my father, have done! -You can't win! -If I lose, I'll die! Are you ready? Very well. I will show no mercy! I have to protect myself! I will kill you! It's a man's fight. Come on! You did it on purpose! No... That's not... true... You.. finally.. became... a man. Father..! I was hoping you would call me that. I know. You didn't want me to become the killer of my own father. That must be the reason. Idiot! Don't worry. It was truly a man to man fight, wasn't it? I killed you! I know it... -I was going kill you... But, my memories.. of your childhood.. bothered me. I would have... won in terms.. of skill. Take care.. of yourself with a.. gangster's kagana.. to accompany.. you on... your.. journey... Stupid...
