Some believe that Eve was the first woman... - born of The Garden of Eden- Others believe there was another... - created flawed, imperfect... - from a substance most vile- Her name is Lilith- She believed she was Adam's equal- Would not lie beneath him- For this, she was cast out- Cursed for eternity... - she became something else... - Her killings were relentless- The Faith was formed... - to end Lilith's wrath- Each of you is part of that same Order. Together, we will fight Lilith... - and all her kind- - Prefect? - Yes, Chapel? Why does God allow such evil to exist? You ask an eternal question. One that will follow you throughout your life. But one thing is certain... the mysteries of this world... will be solved in the next. While we live here... we must put our faith in the Creator's plan. So, Prefect... - the Creator planned what happened to my parents? One day you will not question... - why your parents were taken from this world. You must find meaning in what has happened to you. You must grow, evolve... and overcome. Every life has a purpose and a plan- The Faith has fought Lilith and her brethren for centuries- But one day... - one day, we will stop her- No! Wait! Put the restraints on her! Now! You have succeeded. Not until I've watched her draw her last breath. She will not die today. I forbid it! Prefect, I thought our duty was to end her wrath. - And we have! - The Faith exists to eliminate her! She has to pay for the lives she's taken. - We're not killers, Shaw. - This is wrong! My decision is final. The matter is closed! The Raeborne Team received... - the "Starker Prize" for pioneering research that extends human life- Former member, Anders Raeborne was expelled in a major scandal... - for testing dangerous substances on humans- Son of team leader Cyrus Raeborne... - Anders has not been heard from in over a year- His whereabouts are unknown- Lies. Silence! It's pure. No one believed that I could accomplish this, except you. This time, there are no side-effects. It's flawless. I tested it myself. Do it! We've conquered the valley of death. Immortality. Put it to the test. Again. Still alive. True immortality wears a different face, Anders. You're more than human. You're a Demonicos. Your destiny awaits. I'll be watching. Now, go. Go, go! I've located agent Geresh. He had this. Prefect, an Agent has been murdered. Our security breached. Someone is tampering with Darklight. The prophecy has begun. Maltheus 6: "And the Demonicos... shall carry a Red Plague... sweeping the earth... smiting mankind." Then we only have a few days before it's too late. Her time has come. Elle- "Each mark carries the curse... - that the bearer shall suffer for all of eternity-" - I smell trouble. - What? I'm just bringing you flowers. There's no trouble in that, is there? With you, Elle, I never can tell. Are you all right? Abe, what do you know about biblical curses? Not a darn thing- Why? - There's something called "The marks of Daggoth". I read about it. Elle, why do you do this to yourself? It's been three years since I took you off the streets... - a vagrant. - And I'm grateful for it. Elle, listen to me. You need to focus on... building a new life, here and now. Now you got a new job. What about that? You call working at a flower shop a job? I call it a start. I have to find out who I am. Elle, you may not want to know everything. You've got a clean slate... something most people just dream about. Use it! It's not so easy. Yeah... I'm trying to figure it out. Let us now, pray for this child... - who is to receive the sacrament of new birth- Deliver him, oh Lord... - Open his heart to Your grace... - - This is Shaw. - Shaw, I need your help- The Faith is in trouble- We need to meet- - Marcus, slow down. What's wrong? - Someone has committed sabotage. - You're the only one I can trust. - Right, Marcus. Where are you? Loading Dock 44. The Toschko Plant. Do you know where that is? Yes, I know where that is. I'll be there as soon as I can. - Is there some place we can talk? - I don't think it's a good idea. Jenn, please, just give me a chance. It's Conner's fourteenth birthday. I know. Will, why did you come today? Our marriage is over. You still haven't moved on. Conner is gone. I didn't come for the lecture. I just came to give you this. It's for your newborn. Congratulations! Will? I really have to go. Marcus! - Marcus! - Shaw. Who did this to you? Marcus? I'm open! I'm open! Are you all right? I swear I couldn't stop! Don't worry about it. I'm fine. Dr. Hardwick is one of the four Raeborne Team members... who have revolutionized our understanding of human mortality. We're pleased to have you on this broadcast. Thank you. Tell me, where does your Team's discovery take us? Can we extend the human life span... to 150 years? Oh Jerry... we're a long way from an advance like that. We've simply provided a road map to... See? This is what happens when you cut the budget, Ray! I'm terribly sorry! Are you ok? Yeah. It's just a rash. It's nothing. All medical units be advised... - there are unconfirmed reports of a highly contagious virus- Patients with rash like symptoms should be immediately taken... - to the nearest King's Point Care Center- Marcus is dead. - Murdered. - I promise there'll be retribution. But there's something more pressing. A Demonicos is loose. And it's carrying the Red Plague. So, we'll handle it like we handled other one. The Talis won't work. It's immune. Go to King's Point, William. Contact Lilith. Train her. - You're not serious! - She's the only weapon we have. What you're asking is something I can't do. Can't or won't? Is this really wise, Prefect? See to it. Why is she still alive? Who are we to question why? If only you had killed her when you had the chance. - Come in. - Thank you. I need to speak with her right away. Is she here? She's gone. She fled again. I don't know where she went. You might try Abel Gardens. She goes there often. Makes sense, because it was us who placed her there. Yeah. Thank you. Be careful. She's confused. Going through changes. I'm not sure what she's capable of. You need practice. I'm not interest in company or conversation... - in case you didn't notice it. - Just a moment of your time. Do you know why you have those marks on your arm? You don't remember anything before you woke up here three years ago. It's public record. If you're trying to scare me, don't bother. It's public record because we staged it that way. Have you ever heard the name "Lilith"? An old legend from the Garden of Eden. She was Adam's first wife. An immortal. She was cursed and became a demon out for revenge. - What's that got to do with me? - The legend is true. Lilith curse is known... by the five Marks of Daggoth... on her wrist. Everything you know about yourself is false. You took the name "Elle" because it was the only letter... that you could remember from your real name. You have no memory... because you have this substance... inside you. It's blocking out the past. Why would I believe you? I don't even know who you are. My name is William Shaw. I work for an organization. It's called The Faith. And I need your help. I know all of this sounds crazy... but there's something out there called the Demonicos... and in a few days, all that you care about... will become meaningless. And you're the only one that can stop it. I think you've got the wrong girl, William. I'm not going to go out there and fight some evil. I can't even hold down a minimum wage job. I've got real problems. You can't run away from this. It will catch up with you. I know that mind of yours is still functional, Anders. So I'm certain you'll grasp the importance of what I'll tell you. The one person out there who can kill you, Lilith... is now hunting you. I suggest you strike first. Abe? Run! Things got a nasty bite. - Am I dying? - Not yet. This will neutralize the Talis in your bloodstream. Accelerate your ability to heal. Now, just rest. Save your strength. We've got some catching up to do. Here. What did you shoot into me? I removed the Talis that's been clogging your body. This is what it looks like in solid form. It's bark from a tree. Dates back to the Garden of Eden. Here. Abe was one of us- He believe in your potential- - What do you want me to do? - Prove him right. You have extraordinary gifts. You can either use them to help... or watch everyone around you dead. It's your choice. Show me what I'd have to do. In order to use it, you have to understand the source of your power. It's called "Darklight". An energy as old as the universe. It's what you're made of. It's what makes you unique. It's the reason why your wounds always heal. And it makes you damn near invincible. You're going to go through physical changes. Not all of them pleasant. You'd better prepare yourself. You're not hurt. Now focus. Your instincts will take over. Ok. So, other than Talis, nothing can hurt me. Exactly. Next lesson. Sometimes there's nowhere to run. You have to read the situation and improvise. I warned you. - You like it down there? - Not bad. But don't get overconfident. Now, let's go. We have our first appointment. We're here to see Dr. Katherine Hardwick's body. The director is out sick, like the rest of the staff. - Can you come back tomorrow? - No, that won't do. We have to see her right now. Ok. Follow me. Here she is. We should get the first test results back tonight. No, no! Don't touch it! Where are the others? - We need to go- - If it's this contagious... everybody who has touched these bodies, could be infected. - They could be spreading it by now. - You catch on quick. How bad is this thing? Heard of the Black Plague? The Middle Ages? Think of something a hundred times worse- - What is it? - I have to stop- What's wrong with your hand? Will, are you ok? It happens sometimes. I can't control it. How long have you had it? Since my son died. - I'm sorry. I didn't know. - I don't want to talk about it. I have news. Shaw has begun his work with Lilith. But the Red Plague... is spreading. Please, sit. This is difficult for me... but it's time you know the truth. There has always been a link between you and Lilith. The day your parents died was a Faith mission... gone terribly wrong. We didn't know that a boy had survived the fight... and managed to find us. It was our pursuit of Lilith, that caused the death of your parents. By not telling you the truth until now... I was trying to protect you. I did know... even though you never told me. But you did teach me about the human spirit... and how it can overcome the greatest of the tragedies. I have learned not to question why things happen. Through faith... and prayer... I have found strength. More strength than you can imagine- Today I am proud to announce... the formation of Raeborne Life Industries. A private entity established to turn... the Raeborne Team's research... into new antiaging drugs. The revolution in extending human life... is just beginning. I'm certain the late Dr. Hardwick... would want us to continue this pioneering work. Now I'd like to present this short video. The Fountain of Youth: Does it exist? The Raeborne Team has made discoveries... - that one day, will lead us to the well-spring of eternal life- Attention, all units- Wild animal loose at the Jasmin Hotel- Numerous casualties are reported- - All units respond- - Game time! Move, move, move! Let's go! Let's go! Where is everybody? Let's go! Stay with me. I don't understand. Why come here? What's so special about Raeborne Life Industries? Quiet. It's here. Now remember, your Darklight is the only thing that can kill it. - Get in close to be effective. - What if it gets me first? Focus. Just trust in the training. Now, you head up top. I'll stay here... and draw it out. Get up! Wait! - Or he dies. - What do you want? Why do you fight me? This Shaw, he wants to kill you. He used Talis against you. He hates you with all his will. You and I are of the same blood. I'm not like you. So many innocents were killed... by your hand. - You didn't tell me. - Elle... No, my name is not Elle. It's Lilith, remember? You put that thing in my neck. You tried to kill me, didn't you? That's right. Because you murdered my son. - I don't remember your son. - That makes one of us. Let's just do this. End it now. I don't want to kill you. I just want answers. Ok? Let's go. There will be no turning back- These samples could be enough to create a vaccine for us. I take it you received the book. - That was from you? - Yes. Are you now ready to reclaim the past? Yeah. Follow me. Am I responsible for all of this? Yes. The world was created from love and hope. Qualities which are Divinely Ordained. Each of us has them, except you- You rejected paradise- You were cast out- You could never die- Darklight raged inside of you- Your pain was all consuming- This organization was formed to stop the evil you spread- Talis brought you down- You were on the edge of death- The prefect made sure that you were kept alive- We placed you in Abel Gardens... - knowing you would be labeled as a transient- When you awoke you remembered nothing- Abe was instructed... - to monitor your attempt at a normal life- As Elle, you may have convinced the others... of your compassion and your humanity. But I still know that you are an abomination. And you'll continue to kill. I suggest you do the right thing. It's made from Talis. My gift to you. Anders? My lord, I need to get you to a hospital. No. No hospital. That's why I came to you. The reason Lilith lives... - is because of the prophecy among the most sacred of our texts... detailing her future role as our protector- What happened to Conner couldn't have been Ordained. I don't accept that. I won't. And yet the prophecy exists. You must resolve this conflict in your own mind. Each of us has the task of not succumbing to the abyss. - Don't. - I killed your son in cold blood. I'm cursed. I don't know when I'm going to stop killing. - I might not, unless... - Unless you choose not to. There were five marks on your arm. Now there are four. Curses can be lifted, Lilith. Even yours. But I killed your son. How can you let me live? Because doing this won't bring Conner back. What if I won't be able to control my urges? What then? That will be my responsibility. Give me the knife. Come on. Let's go. We could not create a vaccine... from the specimens that agent Shaw retrieved. We were able to construct this model... from the Demonicos' DNA. As you can see, the brain is highly developed- This node generates the virus. We believe that a vaccine can be created... but it requires fluid from this portion of the brain. - But you need the entire head- - Exactly. There are two ways in which the virus spread. The first is from the Demonicos' bite. The virus is injected through the tongue into the bloodstream. Without a cure, it dissolves flesh in a matter of hours... resulting in death. The second is through contact with an infected individual. Like acid, it burns through clothing and flesh. But, if you can isolate the infected area... you can stop its spread. Contamination is rising. The death total is 93. Within hours, numerous cities will be at risk. The Red Plague is beginning. It's out there, Leo. And it's coming for you. Each one of the Raeborne Team. Father should have never kicked me out. But the three of you... conspired against me... putting him up to it. The Starker Award belongs to me. You parade around with your... trappings of success, but you're frauds. You never revolutionized science. I did. I discovered immortality. You want proof? What have you done to yourself? I've made fools of you all. This area is under martial law- You're quarantined until you prove your identity and your health- Get out of the car. Now. Please remain calm- You will be arrested, if you leave the premises- Any citizen, showing signs of infection... - will be taken to a stage two facility- You can't keep us here. Everyone must remain calm- You won't survive without another injection of Darklight. You did this. The virus was never part of our agreement. You were the one who tampered with Lilith strain. The virus is a side-effect of your own ambition. - I wanted immortality, not... - Well... every wish has its price. Forgot that you're human? I'll deliver Lilith to you. Take what you need... but kill her. They are not going to make it, are they? No. And I don't think they expect us to either. So try and keep the body count down and get us out of here. I'll be gentle. - Stop right there! Hold it! - On the ground now! Don't move! Wait! Hold your fire! - You're with The Faith? - Yes, sir. Look, The Faith saved my life a few years ago. What do you need? If you can get us out of here, I got a way to put an end to all of this. Alright. This way. Stand down! - But, sir... - - I said stand down! Godspeed. A friend gave this to me before he died. There's an encrypted file on it- You crack the code. I think we'll know where you came from. - This is Shaw. - What's the status? I need someone who can break code. I think it will take us to the Demonicos. Shaw, this is not going to be necessary. We found its lair. It's an abandoned facility about the King's Point reservoir. Agents are on the way. They're coming. This is the place? It looks like the Cavalry never came. Do you recognize these names? From the morgue. And the conference center. - These were not random kills. - But why would the Demonicos... want them? They were scientists. Raeborne journal- Experiments on the test subject caused deadly mutations- I've fixed the problems- Tomorrow, I'll prove the world wrong- Revenge. I caused all of this. Check this out. Talis-tipped. For my protection. Chopin was a fascinating individual. He wore his beard on the right side of his face. The side people saw during his performances. People only see what we want them to see, Lilith. Nothing more. Enjoy the music. Well, I have to hand it to you, William. I never thought you would turn Lilith around. It's very impressive. The two of you have been quite a thorn in my side. It's too bad she's not going to make it. Why are you doing this? There are no answers in life, William. You should know that. As much as I've searched, I've found nothing- Evil not only exists in this world. It prevails. The Faith has accomplished nothing... except to ease the pain and delay the inevitable. Remember what the Prefect used to tell us? "The mysteries of this life will be revealed in the next." Well... I am forcing the Creator's hand. Judgment Day. You're sick. And you'll die like everyone else. Yes... but not before looking into the Prefect's eyes... as he watches the world come to an end. For that, I will gladly sacrifice my soul. What about Raeborne? Is he one of your converts? Anders? No? He's just a petty man, seeking revenge against his father... - and the Raeborne Team- He played right into my hands- I knew he would start the Red Plague- How did you keep tabs on him? I have a tracking device. Anders is so desperate for answers... - he'll believe anything you preach- I thought you were a man of faith. My father was a man of faith... and it earned him an early grave. I have learned that there is no purpose in life. No grand scheme. All is wasteland. Wake up. You remember anything? Only your ugly face. You are so resilient. And so was Marcus. But we know what happened to him. You have a cure. I don't leave things to chance. Hold on. I'll figure something out. Optimistic. It's in my bloodstream. You know that. - Where are you going? - Get another dose of the cure. - You got to get Raeborne. - I can do both. - There isn't time. - What are you talking about? Follow Raeborne. Get to the people that are infected. Their time is running out. - Now, go. - What about you? I knew the risks. Now go. Go! Hello- Jenn, it's Will. There's something I need to tell you. Put one on each table- - It's about Conner. - Will? Are you still there? Yeah, I'm still here. It's crazy now- We just opened the new restaurant- - Jenn, I haven't much time. - I can barely hear you- I said... I haven't... much time. Will, you're breaking up... - Where could he be? Where is Conner? Yeah. It's my turn. Ok, ok. Don't cheat. - Don't leave the perimeter. - Ok. One, two, three... four, five, six... forty! Conner! You're too late... just like when you were too late with your son. The viral outbreak crisis continues in King's Point- The governor has declared a state of emergency... - and called in the National Guard- The centers for disease control... - have reported cases of infection across the east coast- The origin of the mysterious plague, which scientist say... - is far deadlier than Ebola virus, is still unknown- Some are calling it: A disaster of biblical proportions- One thing is certain: Unless a vaccine is quickly developed... - the entire nation will be threatened by this epidemic- Jackson Therber, standing by King's Point General... - - with this reports- - It's chaos here- People are demanding answers- Dr. Raeborne, the sooner we get you out of the city, the better. Now? The only way to protect you from this thing... is to get you on the base. I don't think you understand... - the urgency. Let's go! Go, go, go- Doctor, wait here. Under no circumstances are you to leave this truck. Be right back. Anders, son... all this people... Why do this? I can still help you. Hey up here! Hurry! I... Both cure and vaccine have been given to the authorities. The Red Plague has been eradicated- You were the one who believed in her. But you were the one who didn't lose your faith- And for that, I thank you- Continue on the path. I've had to make new memories. You should do the same. I don't know where to start. Start here. You're needed. There are threats only you can handle. I need to do something first- Since the dawn of creation, I've been searching for a purpose- Now, I have one- I'm here to protect- The Faith is my calling- My name is Lilith-
