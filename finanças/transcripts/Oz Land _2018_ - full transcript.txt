Thank you, Lion. Scarecrow. Tin Man. Let's go, Toto. Woof! I'll never leave home again. I love you all! Home is the best place! I'm going! That line I said as Dorothy in the school play. I totally agree. I love my hometown. I love my friends and family. I love my given name, Kurumi. I love my skin, just like my mom. And I love my boyfriend, who loves me. Toshi! I got in the same company. I can work with you! Congratulations! You'll be my junior again. I'm never leaving my hometown. I'll live here happily ever after with the people I love. You can see Mt. Fuji on your left. That was my wish. "Personnel Transfer Notice Kurumi Namihira" Wow, you're in the Project Division! But it's at Greenland... You should be proud. The park belongs to the Tokyo Prince Hyatt Hotel Group. But... It's Kumamoto. You should go. Try living on your own. But I joined this company so I could be with you. A long-distance relationship won't break us apart. You're from Tokyo? A tourist? What's to see in this town? Here, put this on. This? Don't worry! Just keep this in mind, okay? - "The Five Principles." - Right. - Any problems, newbie? - N-no, sir. Don't be afraid! Mr. Numata's face is always serious. Uezono! Quit fooling around. This is the default me. Hi, there. Yoshimura and Namihei. No, it's... What's wrong, Namihei? - My name... - Oh, I forgot. You're older than me. I mean, my name is Nami-hira. Really? Hold on. "Kurumi Namihira" You did aikido and cheerleading. But, Namihei works. It's easier to remember. It's okay! It's not okay. "Gold 9 over the rainbow!" I repeat. "Gold 9 over the rainbow!" - Let's go. - On it! Come on, hurry! Where are we...? "Never run in front of the guests!" - What? - The Principles. Oh. It says, here. Okay, I won't run. So, what are we...? "Gold 9" near the Dinosaur ride. I repeat. "Gold 9." - "Gold 9"? - It's a code. It means we have an emergency situation. "Over the rainbow" means the toilet. Can someone explain the situation? Someone left it there long time ago. "Anything left behind..."? Um... "belongs to a guest." Come on. Pick it up. Namihei, go. Oh my god. I know. It's a bomb. - A bomb?! - Quiet! Don't panic. Principle. "Never shout. Always smile in the park." I get the principles. What should I do? Evacuate the guests. That would cause a panic. Wait. - Let's call the police. - You're right. "Never let emergency vehicles in the park!" Another principle. This is a dreamland. No police. But we have to. Guests come here because it's a dreamland. - But... - No police! We will carry the bomb outside. That way. - Over here! - This way. Hurry. - You can run now! - What? Go Namihei! Yoshimura! Where are we? You brought the secret weapon! Let's fight the enemy, Nessa Rose! They're here! Demolish them! No. Everybody, please evacuate! Give me that weapon! She's cool! You, petty human! Get her! Yoshimura! Good job! Now let's fight together! I'm not part of the show! Ouch! This is not a joke! Yoshimura! Wait! Take this! Nessa Rose! Oh noooooo! The newbies saved Greenland! Applause! "Local Heroes Welcome New Employees" Great job, new girl! Yes! That went so well! What a great welcome event. - Good job! - Good job! Good job. Yeah, newbie! Let's go! What is this place? Oz Land Oz Land and the Wizard of Smiles. I want to go home. Cheer up. What time's the party? Seven. It's nice they're having a welcome party. But, they're weird. Don't judge them. I'm not judging them. I think you'll fit in. You love theme parks. This is not that type of theme park. I hate it. Don't say that. I heard the director of Greenland personally chose you. I know, but... Why me? You should go for MVP. What? Every year they select the most valuable employee. The MVP gets assigned to HQ in Tokyo. Oh, I see. But I don't think I can win MVP. You have what it takes. You can also learn from the Wizard of Greenland. Wizard? Go and get to know him at the party. The wizard. Horse Meat SAKURA Sorry, I'm late. I'm a sexy mature lady, you know. Hello... Namihei's here! Salute to bomb squad leader, Namihei! It's Namihira. Nami-H-I-R-A. Everyone's already drunk! Sorry, we started without you. - Applause! - I thought it was from seven. We came here directly from the park. Oh, that's why. Have a drink! Oh, did you meet him, over there? - The wizard? - No, the director. Guess you'll meet him tomorrow. So, Ozuka's famous in Tokyo? Where is Mr. Ozuka? He said he'd stop by later. - Is he that amazing? - Oh, yes. He increased the number of guests by 170% in 10 years. His plans are always implemented. Plus, he's a really nice guy. He's actually quite good-looking. No, no, no, no, no! He made the Five Principles... You okay? Drink some water. He's late. He was really excited to be your trainer. But he does get a bit irritating when he's drunk. Yeah, yeah. Let me sleep! I'm going home. - You okay? - I'll call a car. - Anyone else leaving? - Me! Who else? Mr. Ozuka said... This year's newbies are interesting. - I need a car, too! - That's 16 cars, then. Get up! Namihei! Namiheeeei! - What's that smell? - You ready? I heard you don't own a car. Let's go. But... Who are you? Oh, I'm Yoshihiko Ozuka. Ozuka! Don't say it like that. You hitting on me? Hey! Good morning! She's a newbie. Project Division. There's a place we need to stop by. See ya! - Um... What's this... - Sachiko, the pig. She's been sick, so slept with her all night. Her fever's come down. - You slept with the pig? - Yeah, right there. Hold this. Aren't you in the Project Division? Yup. But I do everything. I take care of guests fighting or complaining, sleep with pigs, write scripts for the hero show... - The hero show? - Yeah, like this one. "New Employees VS Monsters Local Hero Show" So, you planted that bomb? - A bomb?! - Quiet! This is not a joke! I loved your reaction. You win the Ozuka award. There's a bug on you. You don't have to sleep with the pig. Good morning. Good morning, Namihei. It's Namihira. - Good morning. - Hi. Is the park closed today? Nope. Most guests come on the weekends. So, you can relax. No, I'd like you to train us hard. I like being on the receiving side. I heard you choose the best employee each year. Oh, so you're trying to go back as MVP. What's that about? - I want to learn... - Relax. Huh? I want you to use up all 100 trash bags. We're collecting trash? Yayoi and I are busy with an event. Oh, the Flying Monchy event. Summer concert! There'll also be a comedy show, spook tour, and fireworks! It's the park's 50th anniversary. I see. I didn't go to college to pick up trash. Really? Then, what do you want to do? It's the Project Division. I want to plan a project. I see... Okay, go for it! Except, do it after you collect the trash. He's making us pick up trash no matter what. Here. I'll do this route. Let's get this over with and work on a plan! Trash, trash... Yoshimura's walking around all day. Namihei's not doing her job. That's not true. Mr. Ozuka. - What's this? - My event plan. Oh, I see! Let's go! Trash... None here. If you're done, take care of Jessica. - What? - Go! - But you said I could... - Just go! Here. Next, take care of this. What's that? Is he serious? Namihei! Come. There's the Ariake sea. That's Mt. Fugen. Uh-huh. I want this park to be a magical place. Filled with nature, and lots of smiles. You mean something like Disney Sea? Huh? May I go back to work? Sure. - Are you okay with bald guys? - What? This guy at the Dinosaur ride is perfect for you. Oh, I have a boyfriend. Matchmaking is my real job. I'm telling you, I have a boyfriend. I'm the cupid of Greenland! My matchmaking scores are higher than anybody! Rendez-vous! Next, take care of the dogs. Thanks. To the right! - Stretch your arm! - Come on! Watch out! You're almost there. A bit more! Come on! You have nose hair! - What? - I can see it. - See? - No, I don't. - I'm fine. - No! Is he really a wizard? I'm "Queen of the gals". Uezono is "Flimsy scarecrow". Our director makes up nicknames. Mr. Numata is "Blank face in glasses". That's not funny. Mr. Ozuka thinks it's really funny. Everyone's overestimating him. He doesn't take anything seriously. I'm back... Hi, good work. Want some curry? Thank you. Here you go. Here. Damn it. - You don't know what it is? - Nope. It's clear, and they put it in yogurt cups. - You mean, aloe! - No. No? Namihei. You know what nata de coco is? We weren't even born when it was a thing. Right? So, Namihei. Take care of Sachiko's over the rainbow. Why? You don't even read them. You make me do tedious choirs. That's not true. I enjoy it. What? Don't be angry, Namihei. Smile! Stop joking! Why didn't you show her this? No reason. It's not the time yet. You shouldn't have said that. You're on his side? Of course. He's your superior. You sound cold. We're not students anymore. I have to get back to work. Bye. Hey! - Come over here. - Yes, sir. - Hold it. - Okay. - Be careful! - I will. Could you talk to Mr. Ozuka for me? Huh? I'm here to plan projects. You chose me to work here, because you believed you could count on me. Let me live up to it. I wasn't counting on you! I just thought your name was funny. Very entertaining. I guess I misread your name, though. You didn't choose me because of my rĂŠsumĂŠ? You're a Waseda graduate. Yoshimura went to a better university. - What? - Don't you know? He's from the university of Tokyo. Hey! I got it. I wasn't keeping it a secret. Doesn't this kind of work piss you off? I used to do research on slime molds. Slime? They're like amoebas. Like this. Oh. I wanted to stay at the university but found out I couldn't. So, I wanted a job that... you know, would make my heart warm. - Hmm. - Yoshimura! And... Namihira. - I need your help. - Sure. - Are you alright? - Yeah, sorry. Over here! He fell during inspection. Are you okay, Yamada? Thanks for coming. Both of you. - This leg? - Yeah. - Here he is. - Thanks. Thanks. Morishima! - Pick him up. - Wait, wait! I'll call an ambulance. - Don't! No ambulance. - Why not? It's one of the Five Principles, remember? But, that's silly! - It's not silly! - But... Then... Why don't we have the ambulance wait outside the park gate? - Good idea. - Let's do that. Okay, let's get going. - Thanks. - Hang on. Thank you. - Don't run! - Go slowly, Yoshimura. - Hello. - Hi! We'll be ready soon. All set. It's okay now. - Excuse me! - Yes? We want to go the haunted mansion. Haunted mansion. Well, let me see... She doesn't know? - Where is it? - Give me a minute. Namihei. Can I help you? We're looking for the haunted mansion. - Where? - This one. - It's this way. - Thanks. I can't believe Mr. Children existed when you were a baby. - I know. - Huh? I know I'm useless. Unlike Yoshimura. Don't... Just take it. Let's go. Come on. Gosh, it's been a while. I feel like I wasted a whole month. There's Uezono slacking off. You must be angry. Why? I didn't do what you told me. I think you work hard. You're quick at cleaning. I'm not! I just collected trash from trash cans. I cheated so I could do a project. Really? You're smart! That's a relief. Why? If you pick up trash, you learn about the park. You learn about the people who work here. But you know nothing. Because, you were cheating. I'm sorry. I like you. You're unpredictable. Unpredictable? I was that hero you knocked down. Filling in for an actor who got sick. Really? The audience went crazy. I hurt my back, though. - I'm sorry. - Don't be! - You should be proud! - Huh? You made people happy. You did it. That's our job. There's a missing child in the park. Details? 5 year old Rizumu Tachibana. Red shirt. Denim overalls. Blue sneakers with colorful shoelaces. Where did he go missing? By the Kumamon monument. He got in a fight with his mother. If that's the case, let's not announce it. He might hide. Yayoi, do we have balloons? We have 1,000 in stock. Let's hand out balloons to attract him. By the Go cart, Kids area, and Goku statue. Uezono, Numata. Put on a hero costume and do a search. Got it. Let's try to find that boy. Ready... Go! Our uniforms stand out. Definitely not fashionable. Everyone sounded so serious. They want to be first. First? It's a rule I made. The first person to find the kid gets to be Lord of the day. Or Queen, or Princess. - It's a game? - It's okay. Kids won't come near a desperate adult. Red shirt. Denim overalls. Blue sneakers with colorful shoelaces. Who wants a balloon? Come and get one! Pick any color you want. Here you go. Thank you for coming. Thank you. No sign of him at the north gate. He's not near Kumamon. Not by the merry-go-round or front gate. Let's make an announcement. We'll find him faster with the guests' help. Let's wait a bit more. I'll search the Lunapatheo area. I see a blue sneaker in the lake. We got him! Seriously? That's enough. But you smell like a crawfish. Stop laughing. Get her a towel. You were laughing, too! Don't you love his laugh? He seems so happy. Mr. Ozuka seems happy all the time. He's happy to welcome new family. What? You and Yoshimura. Everybody who works here is family to him. Family? Didn't you know? - This way, Lord? - Aye. Come inside. Use my hair dryer. Thank you. Here. That was hilarious! Namihei! Great job! But it wasn't the boy's... This boy, is the owner of the shoe you found. - Hello. - Say thank you. Go on. Thank you. This is for you. You're welcome. And thank you. - Say good-bye, now. - Bye. Good bye! - Bye! - Bye! - Bye-bye! - See you! Are you gonna cry? Of course not. Lord, it's getting late. Hey, crawfish. Get yourself cleaned up. Huh? When we find a missing child, the director buys us dinner. Everybody has to go. Or, do you want to go home to shower? No, just give me 3 minutes! You won't get rid of that smell. July Who's your favorite? - Tammy. - Ai-chan. Stand next to her. Are you ready? Flying Monchy! Thanks. Have a look. Who's your favorite? I don't even know their names. Do you? - Most of them. - Impressive. You're in charge of the Flying Monchy event. What? Greenland Theme Park. Hold on, please. You're in charge. Already? You're backing down? - Of course not. - Okay. This is Namihira. I'm in charge of your event. Yes. Yes, we'll be waiting. No, that won't be a problem. See you soon. What should we do? Hmm... We'll rearrange tomorrow's schedule. Yoshimura, you can go home. They're coming! - Yes! - Really? They're finally coming! We're delighted to have you. Have a seat, please. - The traffic was terrible! - I see. Sorry I couldn't answer your calls. That's alright. Take care of them. Dinner is ready. This way. Sorry, we already ate. The girls were hungry. Oh, is that so. Your room keys. Have a good night's rest. No, no! You have to let us on the rides. - The rides? - Uh-huh. We're sorry but the park is closed. Our employees have left. She said it wouldn't be a problem. The person in charge. Really? Well, 30 minutes or so after closing hours would be no problem. I never imagined you'd be this late... (Seriously?!) Oh, come on! I told the girls they could have fun. No rides? - No way! - Bummer. - No! - That can't be true. Just for little while, please! Let the girls have a good time tonight, and tomorrow will be a success! But there's nothing I can do... I already promised the girls! Why don't to you check in to your rooms, and come back in 30 minutes. - You mean... - It's okay! Yes! - We get to go! - Great! Follow me, please. Thank you! Namihei here, will take you to the park. - Namihei? - Like the cartoon character? - Watch your step. - Thank you. We have 30 minutes, so hurry. - Mr. Ozuka... - You take care of them! Really? - It's so dark. - Where're the rides? - It's dark. - You said it would be open. - He lied. - Again. This sucks. Are you sure we can go on the rides? Um... - Nothing's moving. - Doesn't look good. You should keep your promise. I'm tired. - Look! - Wow! Welcome to Greenland! - It's open! - Let's go! - Hurray! - Thank you! - Which ride first? - This is awesome! You're in charge! Oh, right! Here's the Ferris wheel. Please watch your step. Don't run! Thanks so much. I did nothing. - She did. - No, I... The girls have been working hard. Tonight, they finally get a summer break. I'll go take pictures. You're the best manager! Thank you! Smile! It's so late. Why did you come? Because Ozuka asked me to. I'll dismiss that since it's after working hours. You're like Ozuka. Ozuka called me tonight. I could hear it in his voice that he desperately needed help. I don't know those girls, but I came to operate the merry-go-round. Then, what do you know! It's the middle of the night and everyone's here! Ms. Namihei! Can I brag to my daughter that I serviced those girls? Of course. Rendez-vous! Namihei, let's take a break. Wait, I'm almost done. August Hey, wait up! You done with the long-distance boyfriend? A bald guy close by is better than a handsome one far away. - He's coming. Tomorrow. - What? See you around. - What do you think? - I like it. Me, too. How's the lighting going? We're almost done except for a few areas. Let's get everything ready before tomorrow's fireworks. Right. Kurumi? Oh! - Kurumi! - No, I'm too sweaty! Hi. I thought you were coming tonight. I wanted to see you. Here, this is for everyone. Handsome man, you brought me a gift! Um, for everyone. Come and ride the merry-go-round. Rendez-vous! Sure. - It's so hot! - Oh, you're back! This is my boss of the Project Division. Mr. Ozuka. I've heard all about you. I'm from Tokyo HQ. Toshiro Konishi. - Namihei's boyfriend. - Don't. Namihei, you can go on your lunch break. - Now? - There. You're on your break, now. Go have fun with your boyfriend. - Are you sure? - Of course! - But... - Just go! Get out of that uniform. Go on. I'll be right back. Thank you. Take care of her. She's been working hard. Thank you. You know, Mr. Ozuka uses an hour worth of fireworks in 30 minutes to make it exciting. - Hmm... - He's really good at planning events. But the events are shoddy, right? - What? - It must be tough. Working with those nosy people. - Not, really. - This place sucks. There're no guests. It's a waste of land. You were right. This is one of the 7 illuminations we made this summer. I want you to see it tonight. How far is your place from here? About 10 minutes by car. Can we go? We could... But you haven't... even seen half of the park. Yeah. Kurumi. Come back to Tokyo. What? I thought it'd be better to tell you at your place. But before, when I said I wanted to go home... You told me not to. I know. But remember that you wanted to work near me? This long-distance thing is tough. But I've been working really hard and I'm beginning to learn the job. That was for the MVP. You don't have to work hard anymore. You told me to stay. Now you want me to stop working. What do you expect from me? I don't know. I really don't. But, I like the Kurumi you used to be. So... Let's live in Tokyo and have fun, like before. I can't. Huh? Hey! I'm all wet! I can't be the girl I use to be. Kurumi? This place. You might not like it. But I do, now. So... You mean we're breaking up? I really appreciate that you came. - And then... - Yeah? - See? - It's a bird. Namihei. You look like you took a bath. Oh, I just got splashed really bad. Where's the boyfriend? Well, he... went home. Really? Oh. I'll get changed. Thank you for visiting Greenland. Tonight, the Fire Festival will begin at 8 pm. 10,000 fireworks will light up the sky for your enjoyment. - I'll take the lead. - Okay. Okay. Here we go. Namihei. Did you have lunch? I didn't have time. - This really came out nice. - I know. No luck. It's probably a fundamental problem. Like two years ago, when the power panel short-circuited. - I guess we'll just leave it off. - No! We can't let the guests see this. So, we cancel? I'll call Mr. Ozuka first. Actually, I have an idea. Welcome to Greenland. Before we begin the fireworks, we will put a magical spell on you. Three... two... one Please enjoy the fireworks in a world of darkness. If you need help, please call a staff member. Where's her usual accent? - It's her business accent. - Really? Announcement's done. We have 30 minutes. Let's move it. Gyro Storm area, clear. Kumamon area, clear. Kids area, clear. Merry-go-round, clear. Hey, how's it going? Don't just stare at me. - Sorry. You seem kind of happy. - Do I? Megaton area... Oh, my god! Director, what's wrong? It's burnt up. It's a snake. Can we fix it? We can replace the burnt wires. That's easy. I'll be right there. - I'm on my... - Uezono, you take care of it. What? No need for everybody to go. But... Let's watch the finale. The blackout was a great idea. But you have bad taste in men. Replacement, done. We did everything we could. You're not the hero. Idiots always want to be the hero. Here it comes. The last big one. Lights, on. What happened? Namihei? The lights are on. Yessssssss! I thought we might not make it this time! Oh, come on. What? You look good. We have a missing child. Guess they didn't notice it during the fireworks. September Namihei. Choose your rice-ball. Bonito flakes. All set! - Thanks. - Thank you. Enjoy your family trip. Theme parks are the best place for families. I know. Greenland is the only family trip I went on as a kid. That's why you hitchhiked here? How'd you know? No more for you. You need to come up with a 50th anniversary plan. I'm off duty right now! We already have plans for the anniversary. A comedy show, hero show, and fireworks. It's the same all the time. Nothing new. But, it's what the guests love the most. You can't just repeat the same plan. Mystery solved. Mr. Numata, you're drunk! He never looks drunk, though. We'll have a meeting tomorrow! Namihei and Yoshimura. You come up with a project. You're making us do the work! Mr. Children was singing when you were born. You can do better than me! - That's the reason? - It's true! People come up with ideas based on their experience! You guys can create a new Greenland! That's a good story. The wizard's out of ideas? I achieved most of the things I had in mind. So, there's still something left. - Shut up! - Shut up? - Come on, tell us. - Shut up! Shut up!!! Keep it down! Shut up!!! No one else can sit in the back seat. Okay. - Oh! - I'll help. Sorry. Letter of Resignation Yoshihiko Ozuka President Hajime Miyakawa Namihei! "Letter of Resignation" "Due to personal reasons," "I am announcing my resignation," "effective March 31, 2019." Look at this. Mr. Ozuka is going to leave. That's why he's making us work on the project. Listen. We have to keep this a secret. Great view, right? You enjoy collecting trash? Trash is proof that guests came and enjoyed themselves. That's why Mr. Ozuka made us do it. - Well, he's just copying me. - What? I trained him. Really? When Ozuka started out, he didn't get along with anybody. Always had a grim face. That's hard to believe. He lost his father as a kid. His mother also passed away when he was in college. And so... He went hitchhiking trying to figure himself out. And somehow wound up here. That saucy kid is now a big old funny guy. What he's left undone? I thought you might know something. I'm not sure... Why don't you look up his notes? Here it is. Ozuka's project notes. "DO NOT READ" Here. Here. It says not to read. They wouldn't be here if he meant that. This is meticulous. This brings back memories. I use to copy whatever he did. Like this. My version of his notebook. "Funnest place in the world!" "Best theme park in the world!" Best in the world... Why do you want to be best in the world? How'd you know that? No need to tell me if you don't want to. It's okay. I just wanted to return the favor. Return? To the happy guests who come to Greenland. What does that have to do with being best in the world? Being number one makes people happy, right? You were here all night? Good morning. Um... These are my plans. Ozuka kept them in a file. These plans are terrible. But Ozuka seemed really happy reading them. "Good concept." "Can expect improvement!" I like you. You're unpredictable. You made people happy. You did it. That's our job. You're starting to be like Ozuka. I can't come up with anything. You're so much like him. What kind of advice did you give him when you were his trainer? I said "Imagine someone smiling." "Who did you imagine?" "Think about how you could make that person smile." Something like that. I think that's what I said... Namiheeeei! Let's go home. The main event will be the Magical Balloon Shower. We make the guests smile by dropping 10,000 balloons from a hot air balloon. That's the most important thing. 10,000 balloons will also be a world record, so we want as many guests to take part in this challenge. - Here. - Thanks. This event will be a good farewell gift. It has to be. We can't fail. "50th Anniversary Special Event Free admission" Uezono, make it look nice. Leave it to me. The 50th Anniversary Special Event! The park is now open! Let's catch a heart! Meet your match and become the happiest couple in the world! "Magical Balloon Shower" Here you go. Here's your balloon. Anything wrong? Oh, it's nothing. So many guests are here. Yeah, I'm glad. Dropping 10,000 balloons to make a world record. It is quite an audacious plan. I was worried it may not work. But I guess I was wrong. There'll be no problems today. You can sit back and relax. It's good to be worked up, but remember anything can happen. "Gold 9" at the hero show. Our cast, Aikawa is injured. See? Don't worry. I'm going to fill in. Over and out. Problem solved. Right? So it seems. Found a missing child! Here comes another problem. Can you hear me? Should we announce it? This is Namihira speaking. - Mr. Ozuka is over the rainbow. - Hey. I'll wait until he returns. I don't think you should keep the child and his parents worried. But... Namihei. Cut it out. Hold on. The boy's name is Shigezo. He's 5 years old. What did you see before you got lost? - I remember. - Great. So, what did you see? I saw a boat, a bear, and a dinosaur. Really? His mother is probably searching that area. Uezono, check out the Kids area. Got it. I'm on my way. Mizuki, if the mother's not found in 15 minutes, make an announcement. Sure thing. Is anybody free? A guest dropped his phone at Number 58. I'm on it. You can stay here. If we solve it, there's no problem. Mommy! - Mommy! - Shigezo! It's okay now. We found Shigezo's mom. - Good job, Princess. - Oh! I wanna be called Princess, some day. Yayoi, that was a good call. I'm Princess for the day. Remember? Great job, Princess! Why's your voice shaking? I'm up in the air, right now. Namihei! Is it urgent? I'm a little busy now. Hey, what are you up to? Nothing. It's just that... What? I was thinking that this park is too small for you. So... You can move on to a bigger place to make more people happy. You can trust us. Because Starting today, we're going to be the wizards. I got the phone! Thank you. Thank you so much for coming to Greenland. The hot air balloon will take off at 3 o'clock. Those of you in the parking lot, please proceed into the park. Namihei, you seem relaxed. I'm back. - Good work. - Great job. - Wish I could see your show. - Oh, please. Did you fight, like this? - Like this? - It was really tough. Okay. Let's go. - Roger. - Alright. Who left that there? Put it in your locker. That's been here since this morning. What's wrong? Come on. Who planted this? It's bomb squad Namihei! So, who is it? Come on. Step forward. Nobody? It's real, then? That guy that gave you a letter. What? What did the letter say? Namihei. It said we should cancel the event or else there'd be a disaster. But I thought there's no way I could cancel it. There's less than 7 minutes. Leave it. It's a prank. - What if it's not? - Let's take it outside. There's too many guests. It'll take time. We have to hurry. Mr. Ozuka! Hello. You took the bomb, right? Don't do this! This is not one of your pranks. It's the same. I'm going to annoumce the guests to evacuate. You can't do that. Today's the 50th anniversary. We can't ruin our dreamland. What are you going to do? You can't drive. There's not enough time. You're right, I can't drive. But I can get to the ocean in a balloon. That's dangerous! Is it? I'll throw it in the ocean just in time. Like Tom Cruise. Stop joking. Get out of the balloon! I'm sorry I ruined your surprise. Mr. Ozuka. Don't! Ozuka! "Gotcha!" Namiheeeei! I surprised you, right? Come on. How could you do this? You did the same thing. You planted that guy, as well? He's just a guest who wanted to propose today. Namihei pulled it off. She wrote the whole script without getting you suspicious. She arranged everything. The wizard's desciples have fully grown. I didn't think you'd buy it. I would've never known. You did a great job, Namihei. It's time. Mr. Wizard. Time for you to put a magical spell on Greenland. That's so cheesy. You're witnessing a world record sight of balloons over Greenland. Yessssss! What're you doing? - Wow! - This is amazing! There's nothing to worry, Mr. Ozuka. What? You can leave. Take off on your journey from Greenland! Thanks. It's the wizard Ozuka! Stop calling me that. This way. Why is everybody clapping? I heard no radio calls today. What happened? We had a plan to surprise Mr. Ozuka. Oh, I changed the radio frequency. You did what? You're a terrible liar. You'd give it away. Spread the word in 5 minutes. - Let's get ready. - Okay! - Now's the time to tell everyone. - Tell what? - About leaving... - Speak up! About you leaving Greenland! Namihei. Oh. Namihei. What? You didn't know? We've known for months. He's moving to an ad agency in Fukuoka. To make people in Kyushu happy. You really didn't know? I thought that's why you worked so hard. - Yeah. - That's why we joined the surprise. Really? You thought I'd just leave? I didn't know, either! If I told you, you'd tell me to leave right away. Of course, I would. See? That's why. - I feel bewitched. - Yeah. Let's have a toast! You can come back any time. Greenland is your home. Okay, everybody. Cheers! Cheers! 6 months later April Did you imagine she'd be the MVP? It was a surprise. That matchmaking party at the 50th anniversary event. She created 16 new couples. By the way, winning MVP doesn't mean transferring to HQ in Tokyo. You get to choose where to go. You wanted to work in Tokyo. I did, at that time. Where would you go if you were the MVP? Well... This is my home. Greenland. Oz Land and the Wizard of Smiles. How about dinner tonight? I'm going out with the hero show staff. You never told me that. You can join us, only if you ask nicely. Namiheeei! Good morning! Good morning. Let's have a great day! This girl. Oh, come on! I know that... Here they are! - See you! - Bye! Go ahead with it. - Thank you! - Yeah. Good day! Morning. Rendez-vous! Hey! Hijie, smile! Ms. Namihei, you're always smiling. Of course, this is a magical place. Welcome to Greenland!
