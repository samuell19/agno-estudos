(upbeat funk music) (dramatic music) - I'll bet five bucks this is another dead-end stakeout. - (chuckles) Yeah, I bet you'd like that, huh? So you can get back to that pretty wife of yours, huh? - Which way would you like it? - Yeah, well. Ah. Looks like you just lost 10 bucks. That guy that was just in here, which way did he go? - Out back somewhere. - Out back? - Ah, room 10, man, room 10! (dramatic music) - Dak! (gun banging) - Shit, he's out. All right, police, hold it right there. (siren blaring) - (sighs) Obviously, somebody else was here. The only person we found was Leo Spiegel. - Spiegel? You know, Dak, we seem to have a difference of opinion here as to what you said happened. - So what the hell that supposed to mean? We came out of the office, I took that side, he walked over here, he called me, I turned, he was shot. - But we arrived before Detective Stevens was fired upon, Dak. - Detective Dakota Smith. So what are you saying? - Come on, Dak, cool it. - Detective Smith, you were the only who came out. - You saying I shot him? You're full of shit, both of you. - Hey, chill out, Dak. Put it in your report. And I want this thing wrapped up. - It ain't over, Ward. - What is it with you? (dispatcher chattering) - It's a setup. It stinks, it's bullshit. - So where are you going now? - I gotta talk to Stevens' widow. I should be the one to tell her. - I don't envy you that job. (gentle music) - Sorry about Stevens, Dak. - Thanks, Pete. This is for you old buddy. You will be missed. (knocking on door) - Dak, the station called and told me you were coming here, but they wouldn't say anything else. Where's Paul? - (sighs) It's bad, Lisa. (gentle music) - Is it bad or is it the bad night? - He's gone. He's gone. - No. I've been barely prepared myself for something like this. I just can't believe what's happening. Oh, God. (sobbing) Oh, God. (slow dramatic music) (bell tolling) - How can I help you, Dak? - Chief, I know this may not be the best place to talk about Stevens' shooting. - You're right, it's not. - But there's more to this than has been brought out. - Dak, for Christ's sake, have a little respect for your deceased partner. - I do, sir. But I also the respect the living, me. This was a professional hit, a setup. My only concern was, maybe it was meant for me. - You take this up with Teller? - Not yet. - I know about you and your partner, Dak. You were not exactly model detectives. - We did the job we were paid to do. - I read the reports of Ward and Mahoney. They say it's a drug deal gone bad. You surprised the burglar and he got away. - Yeah right. I just wanted you to know how I felt before things get out of hand. - The only thing that could get out of hand is you. My advice to you is to talk to Captain Teller if you have any real proof regarding these accusations. And don't become a one-man police force out there looking for your partner's killer. Now, if you don't mind, I'd like to finish paying my respects. (birds chirping) (siren blaring) - Very moving funeral, huh? - We both know the crooked politician, Gil Garner, was behind all this. - You happen to see Garner's picture in the paper donating the new burn ward? - What the hell does that have to do with anything? - Well, when an old mobster like Leo Spiegel ends up in some sleaze bag hotel with his throat cut because the fucking gangsters today are all legitimate businessmen. They got too much money, Dak. They buy out restaurant chains, they build condos and they don't hoard their money anymore. And I'd tell you something, if you're thinking about tying Garner to this, I don't think you're gonna make it. I know you and Stevens were close. - We never went out of bounds. - Well, not legally maybe. - What's that supposed to mean? - The board has reviewed the entire case and believe the two officers involved acted and responded within-- - Their coordinates, right? - Dak, the board is concerned about your actions. - So am I gonna be next when I call for backup? You're gonna tell everybody how nice my funeral was? - Oh, Dak, come on. - Yeah, right. - Damn. (upbeat funk music) - So, son, how's your mom? - She's okay. Dad, are you ever coming home? - Me and your mom, we agreed to go our separate ways. You know, nothing has changed since the last time we had this discussion. You know sometimes people, I mean they just, they just don't get along. They just can't live together. But it's not because they don't like each other, they just can't get along, you know what I'm saying? - Yeah, sort of. - Yeah, yeah. I know it's complicated, but just because we're older, don't mean we're smarter. - I know. - You know? What's that supposed to mean, you know, huh? What do you mean you know? What kind of ball is that? You brought the wrong ball anyway, give me the ball. Ball don't have no points on it, what kind of ball is this? I don't play with ball doesn't have no points on it. This is gonna be a zinger. All right, I wanna see you catch this ball. (grunts) I fooled you. - Thanks Dad, I had a good time. - Hey, son, we'll always have a good time. And don't forget our little talk, all right? - I'll remember. Be strong, be tough, and always take care of mom. - Yeah, that's good for starters. Now, next week, I'll give you a new list. - Good, I can't wait. - (laughs) Bye, son. - Bye. - See you, Dad. - Bye. (upbeat funk music) - So what are you here for? Gonna write me a parking ticket? - Look Dak, Bob and I, we're getting a lot of shit we don't deserve. - Well, maybe one of you don't deserve shit. - Listen, partner, I've been trying-- - Hey, don't give me that partner stuff. I'll tell you about partners. Stevens and I were partners for 13 years and we earned that partnership out on the streets. - Look, we didn't sell you out. No one came out of that door but you. - Yeah. And look who was waiting for me. Look, I know the force is full of rotten apples, and somehow they're contaminating the whole goddamn team. - You have a plan? - I'm working on it. - I would like to help you, will you let me? - No problem. When I find out something, you'd be the first to know. (car engine rumbling) (guns banging) (dramatic music) - You guys want to see something funny? Watch this (laughs). (gun bangs) (laughing) Hey, sorry, man, it was an accident. You know accidents happen, right? - No, I don't know, pal. If I was gonna shoot somebody, it wouldn't be by accident. I would just walk right up and blow a hole in their head. - Hey back off, man. - Take it easy, Dak. - Oh, jeez. - You know what kind of gun I carry? A Desert Eagle, the most powerful handgun made in Israel. I know what you're wondering. You're wondering if I'm really holding a loaded gun at your head. Now, that wouldn't be very nice of me, would it? (gun clicks) Oh, it's not loaded. No clip. Next time, you better be more careful, especially when you're around me.

Garner's files are classified. And no one went after Garner harder than Mickey Casey. - Yeah, I know, in the beginning. That's why they brought you in, to help clean out the cancer in this town. Now, Garner owns Casey and this whole damn town. - Mickey Casey is an honorable man and a hell of a D.A. I believe that. - Look, Sandra, I'm not out to hurt Mickey Casey. I just want to look at his files on Garner, so I could do my job as a public servant. - Okay, I'm personal friends with his assistant, Peggy. I'll try and see what's there. - All right, all right.

You know something? You're in deep shit, Toothpaste. - I'm just doing my job here. - You ever been in lock up down in City Hall? - No, sir. - They're gonna have a good time with you. - What do you mean, they? - Sweet Willy and his buddies, they always like to pluck fresh chickens. - Look, if you're trying to scare me, it's working.

Understand this, Captain. I'm gonna bring them both down, that scum Garner and that bullshit D.A. Casey. What I don't understand is why you're kissing their ass. - You don't know if it's Garner or Casey. - Garner owns Casey. - Yeah right, and Garner owns Cale, Garner owns Ward, and Garner owns Casey. Come on Dak, according to you he's the only guy in this city commits any crimes, that's bullshit. - We rattled some cages, we got close. I don't know where yet, but we got close. - You know something, when you were assigned to be my first partner, I thought I was gonna get the short end of the stick. But I want to tell you something and don't go getting a big head about it, but you're the best street cop I think I've ever seen. And the only reason, and the only reason I made captain is because I understand how the politics works in the city, Dak. It's not about right, it's not about wrong. It's different than working the streets. I'll tell you what it's about. It's about PYOA, man. Protect your own ass, man. - Yeah, right. (car horn honks) (upbeat funk music) - Detective Smith? I'm Stanton James, I represent a man by the name of Mr. Gil Garner. We come to understand that you've been saying some uncomplimentary things towards him. I gotta tell you, as his legal counsel, I've got some serious concerns about this. - Who is this, your boyfriend? - For two cents I'd kick your ass. - Go on back to the car, wait for me there. - You work cheap, don't you, pal? - Detective, we believe you're a good cop and you do your job very well. That's why we're prepared. We're prepared to forget about these negative insinuations that you've made towards my client. - You're gonna make me an offer? - Don't get clever with me. I have no intention of trying to bribe you. I'll only say that we won't hold you liable for anything said up to this point. But you could be sure that I will file a lawsuit against you if anything gets said after today. - Well I find that very disappointing.

Why don't you call me sometime? I have a new number. - Hey Dak. - Hi. Let's go. - Hey, why don't you introduce me to your friends? Hey, hey, I'm Nick Gleem. I had a dream one time and those women were in it, all of them. This is a busy place. - Yeah, it is, say, could I get a... - Hey Dak, how's it going? - Hey, hi Kim. Hey, it's going great. - You haven't been around for a few days. - Oh, I know, I've been kind of busy. Can I get a Coke and bring my friend a soda. - On the house. We've missed you. - Come in more often. - I'll try to do that. - All right, see ya. - All right. All right, brother, what do you got for me? - You think you could maybe introduce me as your best friend or something? - You know, I should have pulled the trigger when I had a chance. - (laughs) That's funny, right? - Right. (Dak laughs) - Okay, all right. I went through a lot of trouble to get this information. Glenn Moss is taking the case for a Michael Collins. He's a wheeler dealer out of Atlanta, but that's second-hand. - So what's the address? - Would I fail my new best friend? Signed, sealed and delivered as promised. Oh, and I should let you know that I staked out Miss Collins' townhouse all week. You were the only one who came up besides... - Besides who? - Look, I did my part like we agreed. Now, I could already be in trouble for this. - Kim. - Yeah? - This is my new best friend, Nick Gleem, like toothpaste. - Hi, Nick. - He's from out of town, visiting. Think you could introduce him to one of the girls? - Sure, he's kind of cute. Come back in a couple of hours when they're off work. - Okay. - Name. - Uh, Mickey Casey. He's there almost every night, but he doesn't stay long, so I doubt if it's a quickie. - All right, that's all good. So what do you charge? - For what? - I want you to look into this for me, some copies of the pictures maybe. - Do I really have a date with one of these lovely ladies? - Yeah. Yeah, okay? - You are paid in full. - Yeah, right. - All right. - Keep in touch. - And you're still my best friend, right? All right, all right. All right. Madman. - Nicki. I'm right in the middle of a political scandal here, so I'll be right back here in about five minutes, okay? - Hey, take this with you. (dramatic music) (camera shutter clicking) - Well, you blew it Nick. There's not a thing on that film that you brought me from last night of rolls. - There's got to be. - Nothing. - Oh, man. I got into a little outside action last night. - I'm gonna cover for you this time 'cause I've got some extra photos in this account, but don't let it happen again. Strange account, you know. - Oh, yeah, yeah, it is. Hey, you wouldn't be tied to anything else you got going? - Look, this is not a Fotomat, and I don't ask questions, don't you either. Good, I gotta get back to do some work. Get a better camera. (phone ringing) - Yeah. - [Nick] It's Nick. - Who? - Nick Gleem. Like the toothpaste. - Oh man. It's early, it's 6:30 in the morning. It's too early man. - Well, get your ass up, I'm on my way over. You hired me to do a job and I'm doing it. - Tell you what, do it later, all right? - Hey, did you take your kids to Santa Rio Park last weekend? - What? So tell me about this all night photo lab. - They stay open for guys like me, you know, a lot of pornos, some tabloid stuff, whatever. - You said there were more. - All over the walls man but, I got what I could. - No, that's cool, that's cool, you done good. (sighs) So tell me about your date. - With Gina? I stood her up so I could go home and develop these. - Hey, don't worry about that, I'll clear it up for you. - Yeah? - Yeah. - Cool. Hey, did you ever run a check on Collins? - Yeah. - No such name, number of address? - So how did you know that? - I recognized a couple of the shots on the walls, they were mine. See, you're all mixed up in something. - Well, I'll tell you what, I think it's best that you don't come around here anymore, okay? - Right. - When you call here, don't leave your name, just leave a message, all right? - Got you. You keep these shots, I'll keep the negatives, all right? - No problem. You know something Nick, you're not the sleazebag I thought you were. - Thanks man. I think. I'll find out whatever I can. And don't forget to talk to Gina for me. - Hey, it's a done deal. - Cool. And, Dak, I'd send your family on a vacation for a little while, if I were you. - So what are you, a mind reader now? - Yeah. - All right man, later. (upbeat funk music) Shit. - Who you looking for? - I'm looking for a Glen Moss Detective Agency. - Does this look like a detective agency? - That's real funny, that's real funny. Did the business, some other business used to be here? - There used to be somebody back in the back there, but they moved. Didn't say nothing to nobody. (Dak sighs) - They didn't say where they went, did they? - Sure, didn't. (upbeat funk music) - Hey, what's the deal, I was only here for a minute. - Parked in a red zone, you're in violation. - Your name and your unit number? - What? - Traffic check. Departments like to keep up on the people that are doing the traffic. Your name and unit number. - Swanson, Shirley, number 654. What traffic check? - If I hadn't flashed my badge, you weren't gonna let me go, were you? - No. - That's good, good job. - Well. - You hold that thought, okay? - [Dispatcher] Dispatcher 12. - Yeah give me Detective Cale. This is Dakota Smith. - [Dispatcher] Transferring. (radio beeping) - [Cale] Cale here. - Look, I need you to run a check on a Glen Moss Detective Agency. - [Cale] Got it. What's this all about? - And you can tell the chief that the traffic check program is going very well. - Look, I was just doing my job, Detective Smith. - Yes, you were. And you were doing a very good job. You have a nice day. (phone beeping) (phone ringing) - [Bobby] Hello? - Yo, Bobby. How's it coming with that tape I gave you? - It's not student quality, it's pretty sophisticated. She had to know something about this stuff. - She? It don't sound like no she to me, bro. - The voice is altered, Dak. I'll play it back. Listen real carefully. (tape whirring) - [Distorted Voice] Never ceases to amaze me the power of two barrels. You're next. - Yeah, okay. I understand that it's altered. But that deep voice still don't sound like no she. - [Bobby] I'll bet you it is for a full beer. Let me work on it a little more and I'll get back to you. - All right, well, after you clean it up, get it to me ASAP, all right? - [Bobby] Sure thing, Dak, no problem. (dial tone buzzing) - Yo, Madman. Madman, you in here? Yo Madman, where you at? (dramatic music) (beeping) Hey, hey, it's me, um. We got some problems developing. The place was dead this morning. And the room we discussed is empty. Um, meet me at Joni's at six o'clock. Oh, hey, hey, and don't forget about Gina, okay? Okay, bye. - I think you better show me your best side, I think somebody is taking our picture. Somebody in that red car. - Another two guys in that truck over there. - Sure about that? - 75 to 200 telephoto lens. They followed me in. - Yeah, I had a feeling somebody was following me too. - Look Dak, I'm not too keen on dying today. - Don't worry about it, little brother. I'll take care of it. - Now, I don't like the sound of this. (upbeat music) - So what's the problem, you need a closer look at me? - No problem.

And I'm gonna kick your ass, not necessarily in that order. (foot thuds) (man groans) All right, now for the answers. (gun bangs) Shit. - Listen, Casey, I thought we had this Dakota Smith situation under control? - He's a smart cop. - [Gil] He's not too smart. - Well, he's dangerous. - No, shit. Part of our deal was knowing that right after your little meeting yesterday morning. Would have saved me four very talented employees. I don't know how much this stupid cop knows. I'll be generous. I'll find that slimy camera jockey and you take care of Detective Smith. - Well, wait, I can't, I can't. I can't get involved with anything like that. - (laughs) Try to be a nice guy. Listen, Casey. We have cops on the payroll. You got an unstable veteran cop who is distraught because of the loss of his partner. That's a situation that just might require a shooting. - Teller would never go for that. - Don't tell him that. I want the son of a bitch dead. (dial tone buzzing) - Yeah, okay. (upbeat funk music) - And the files are gone. - Yeah, I kind of figured that. - What are you up to, Dak? - You recognize this? - This is my house. Where did you get all these? - I want you to keep those for me. - No one has the right to do this. This is an invasion of privacy. - Yeah, I know and there's more. Just keep it. - Casey has nothing to do with this. - Maybe, but I'm gonna find out. - What are you gonna do? - Well, my kid is on one of those pictures, I'm gonna kick some ass and get some answers. - You're gonna get yourself killed, aren't you? - (chuckles) Well, that's not the first thing on my list. - Well I appreciate your candor, Dak. - I won't work a desk job. - Mm-hmm, procedure dictates though that until the shooting board makes a decision. - Yeah, I know, it's politics. You want my badge and gun? - Hell no. You brought me half a dozen bodies today with one report. No, I need you out here. - Just let me do my job. - All right. But no hot-dogging, okay? - No problem. (gentle music) - Hi. ♪ Da da da ♪ - Dak explained you were tied up on a special assignment? - Uh, yeah. - Anyway, this is Gina. - Hi. - Gina, this is Nick. - Hi, Gina. You know, I really wanted to keep our date the other night, but, you know, business first. - Well, how about tonight? I get off in a few minutes. - Tonight, I mean. - Mm-hmm. - Yeah, yeah, that's great, tonight. - All right, great. - Tonight. - Thank you, thank you, thank you, man. I just spoke to Gina and... How'd you know I'd be here? What's up, man? - It's a lucky guess. But I'll tell you what, let's talk fast because we only got 10 minutes. - You mean you got all the schedules memorized? What you got? - Whatever I'm tied to you're tied to, and I just don't wanna be responsible for you. - Well, it's too late for that. I knew who you were at Sandra Collins' place. And you really think I couldn't have gotten those shots without you knowing? - So what are you saying? - I read in the paper about your partner. A friend of mine on the Times told me that you were, you're after Gil Garner. - So what? - I got involved with this girl who used to work the streets about the time Garner took over. She wound up a fucking statistic on Sunday night. She said Garner likes to play rough. - Well, I don't have a game plan, but I'm close to something. - I don't think he's scared, Dak. You get your family out of town? - Yeah, they're safe, I think. - Good, good. I pulled in a big favor for this one. I meet a lot of slime balls in what I do. So I can't guarantee the accuracy of it. It's a list of who is and who isn't on Garner's payroll. (Dak scoffs) - Yeah, well, you'd do anything for a date, won't you? - No, don't thank me. You're not gonna like it. Your partner's name was on it. Leo Spiegel was a stoolie. The hit was on for Paul, just a cop cut down in the line of duty, but why the shots of you and Casey at Sandra's? I don't get that part. - It wasn't me, it was for Casey. - But he couldn't have been there long enough. - I mean-- - Yeah, but Casey is a politician. Pictures of him going in and out of Sandra's house, it would make a nice smear campaign. - But what about the pictures of your family? - Yeah. That one bothers me. So all right. You met Gina, right? Yeah, yeah, yeah, she's nice. - So why don't you guys just go have a good time, right? - We're just gonna have a drink first if you wanna go with us. - No, no, no, I got things to do. - All right. - Goodbye. ♪ When you led me home ♪ ♪ All the love ♪ ♪ With the joy I chose ♪ (romantic music) (upbeat music) - Oh, oh, oh.

Dak's the bad guy here. - Is that what this is about, Danny? You'd shoot me too in the line of duty? - All right. The next time you draw it down on me, you better shoot. - You can count on it. (siren blaring) - Let's go. - Hang in there man. (car engine rumbling) (ambulance beeping) (dramatic music) - What happened to you? - I had a run-in with that son of a bitch Dakota Smith. - This Smith is becoming a pain in the ass. - You need to have one of your goons take him out. And I mean quick. - It's being arranged. - So what do you want with me? - I just want to make sure you're still on the team. You're not letting the pressure get to you, are you? - What do you think, I'm like Casey? (chuckles) As long as the money keeps coming, I'm there. But if it stops, well, then you might have another situation. - Is that a threat? - That's a reality. You know, I'm starting to feel like your little empire is about to crumble. And I don't intend to go down with it. - Hmm. - You cut me out and I will personally help take you down. Is this little meeting over? (dramatic music) - Tell me tomorrow, just tell me tomorrow. Business, never stops. Roxanne, it's good to see you. Good to see you, dear. Have a bite of your salad, that will feel you good. (phone ringing) All right, could you come over here in a minute? Excuse me, hello? My end is fine. I'm a people person, Gil. Well, there's no problem with me. I can handle that especially when it comes to a renegade cop. Okay. Well, don't worry, I can handle. It'll be taken care of. Come here. (upbeat music) (phone beeping) - Hello, Sandra? I know you're at work. This is Dak. When you get this message, give me a call on my mobile, okay? Just want you to know I, I'm okay. I'm just a little tired, that's all. Girl didn't make it. Gleem will pull through, okay? So give me a call later. (keys jangling) Shit. (beeping) What the, what the. (tires screeching) (dramatic music) (beeping) (Dak sighs) (car horn honking) - Hey, buddy, move it. (dramatic music) - I just dropped a $2 cigar. - Good. - What you mean good? It's one of my favorites, man. - Okay. But tell me about your other favorite, Ward. Is it personal? - Yeah, you're damn right it's personal. I'm gonna take his ass out as soon I find more proof that he's dirty. - What kind of crazy talk is that? - They've been taking pictures of me, my ex, and my kid. Now, that's bullshit. - And what kind of proof do you have that Ward's involved? - I know he's dirty. I mean, he's a cop on the take to the highest bidder. - So who's the bidder? - Well, let's start with our D.A., Mickey Casey, financed by a corrupt politician like Gil Garner. - You got proof? You're talking of some serious stuff, man. - Yeah, yeah, I know that. No, I don't have anything yet. But I know they're dirty. - You know, Dak, you got the reputation of being a real loose cannon, but bottom line, you're one of the good guys. I've tried everything I can to stay out of this mess, but I still got favors owed me over at city hall. And I think it's about time I called on 'em. Let me see what I can dig up. - Yeah, well that'll work, I'll tell you what you do. You better watch your back though, man. They don't give a shit who they take out. - You'll be hearing from me. (dramatic music) - Hello, Dak. - Detective Dakota Smith. - Always a smart-ass. - This is not a good time to talk to me. I'm not in a very good mood. What is it you want here? - It's about you, Dak. You're trying to push your sloppy police work off into some of our friends. - Really? You mean like Ward and Mahoney? - See, there you go again, naming names. That's a real bad habit you got there. Bad habits need to be broken. Why don't we go somewhere more private to discuss this? - And what if I don't want to go? - I can always shoot you for resisting. - I bet I'm faster. (dramatic music) So what's it gonna be, tough guy? - You're a real asshole, Dak. - Yeah, I know. See you at roll call. No one said this wasn't an overtime job, Captain. - Where is your report? - No more reports. - You were the senior officer on the scene. - Did you know Paul was on the take? - Yeah, yeah, we knew. Internal affairs was watching him, we just didn't know whether you were involved or not. - Did Casey know? - Yeah, he knew. - You let them put my family in jeopardy? Is this the fucking politics I don't understand? - Dak, take it easy now, all right? - I mean, how do you guys do this? Dirty cops, news at 11:00? How do you cover this crap up? - I don't work for Casey! - Why not, Jerry? Why don't you get your little piece? I mean, it's all around you. - They never asked me, Dak! They never asked me. - That's pathetic. - Say, Dak. - Yeah. - I have someone here I think you want to meet. Peggy, this is Dak. - Peggy. - Peggy is Casey's personal assistant. She has files that we had taken up to Chief Block's office. - Where did you get those from? - Oh, I took the liberty of making some copies before I destroyed the originals. You know, after speaking with Detective Cale, I guess it was a good thing I did. It's not something I would normally do, but-- - Interesting. You know, Dak, that's some heavy reading stuff, like bank accounts, payroll sheets, deals with officers we know. - Well, let's not keep Chief Block waiting. Peggy, you have made my day. - Really? - Told you I had contacts downtown. - Hey, Dak, just a minute, I was hoping to see you. - This must be your day. - Teller just gave me an arrest warrant for Ward. I just thought you might like to serve it. - Teller signed this? - Why don't you do the honors? (upbeat music) - Yeah, I'd be happy to. - All right, come on, guys, this should be easy. I'm dealing left-handed. (laughs) There you go. All right, look at that. Look 'em up, look 'em up. (upbeat music) All right Bob, it is your bet. - That's 50. - Oh, Detective Dakota Smith. You looking to sit in, or have you come here to arrest us for gambling? (laughing) What's the, what is it, 50? Okay, I will see that 50, and I'll have a seat for you in a minute. I raise you 150. - I don't like you standing over me like some dog in heat. You mind moving? - You're not gonna like this very much either. It's a warrant for your arrest, Ward. I think I'll take you along as an accessory. - Hey, what's your problem? - Are you crazy? Do you think these guys are really gonna let you take me out of here? - I'll bet your life on it. Bring your hand out slowly so I can see it. Put that .38 you're holding on top of the table. Go ahead. Do something stupid, so I can blow your freaking head off. (chuckles) Stand up. Move over there. - There's still a few good cops left on the job, Dak. We've got your back. - Hey, you should play that hand, it's a winner. This shouldn't take long. - Yeah, about five years. Move it. - All right. Dale's been arrested, so has Ward. Something broke down at the station. We are gonna have some company. (doorbell rings) - You two wait here, I'll handle this. - Where is he, Casey? - Well, I'm sorry, he's not in. - Get him out or I'll look for him myself. - Detective Smith, I hope you don't mind showing me your search warrant. - Left it in the car. - Well, you gentlemen are in a lot of trouble. Mr. Smith, if I were you, I'd be looking for an attorney because I'll be filing charges for harassment. - Yeah, right, call the cops. - What a pleasant surprise, Detective Dakota Smith. You're a welcome guest in my home. So tell me what can I do for you. - Your pal Ward is in jail. - So I heard. - Your stool pigeons are going down one by one. Sooner or later, you're gonna slip and make a big splat. - Would you make a note to remind me not to slip? Now, if you'll excuse me, I have some city business to attend to. - What kind of business? Gil Garner and some investigation that doesn't exist? - Detective Smith, I'm sorry, but you and your late partner promised to send me some proof, yet you sent me nothing. - We did, but your office conveniently misplaced it. - Let me make a point to you very simple, so you'll be able to understand it. As you well know as District Attorney, my office cannot prosecute a citizen in a court of law without evidence, physical evidence, consistent evidence, do you understand that? - Let me get out of here before I do something I might enjoy. - Thanks for coming. This will be the easiest job in the world. I want Dakota Smith dead. Find a colleague and go shoot his ugly head off. And get me that Assistant D.A., Sandra. What's her name? - Do you want me to fix it, boss? - Resist gunplay. A little accident will do nicely. We have a huge volume business, I don't want it interrupted. Hm, it feels good, it feels good. - Dak, would you come in here a couple of minutes? (Dak sighs) Come on in Dak, I need to talk to you. I've talked to an awful lot of people, Dak. Frankly, I don't know what to make of this Casey business. - (sighs) Like I've been telling you, Garner's behind all this. Casey and Ward are just two of his pawns. - According to you. - Didn't you see that file on Casey that Cale brought you? - I saw 'em, and we're investigating them. And if we find any hard evidence, we'll prosecute. - You're not gonna do shit, are you? You're just gonna let it all go down. - Don't take an attitude here, Dak. Your ex-partner was heavily involved in the city's drug traffic. And to be honest, you're still under investigation. - I'll save you the efforts, Chief. - What's this? - I'm an easier target unprotected. - Look, I didn't ask for those. And damnit, I don't want to go to any more funerals, nor do I want you to be a target. - It's not the target I'm worried about. It's who's doing the shooting. (dramatic music) (car alarm wailing) - What are you looking at? I didn't do it. - Check it out. - Are you okay? - I think so. How's your family, are they safe? - Yeah, they're fine. But the fact they used them to get to me, I take very personally. - I found a record of Casey doing business with Garner. - Where? - I found it at the end of a computer file that hadn't been erased. I know we have a case on him. I just know how far we can go. He's so powerful, Dak. I don't know if we can beat him. - Yeah. It's time to get down and dirty. - That's what you wanted to do all along, isn't it? (groaning) (guns banging) - You wait here, I'll be back. (groaning) - Oops. - Dak! - You take care. - All right, I know, I know, I know. I'll clean up this mess. (tires screeching) (metal clanging) (grunting) - [DAK] So where did they take Sandra? - Screw you. - Real tough guy. Call the paramedics. - How many should I tell them are wounded? - Tell them no survivors. (guns click) - Casey's, they took her to Casey's. - I'll see you there. - Cuff yourself to the dishwasher. Now! - Let's see, let's see, let's see. - I know it looks bad. - Bad? That's like saying the Titanic in a rocky voyage, Mickey. Am I right, John? - There's always one guy, you know that. - It was manpower you needed, fine, that's no problem. The takeover, a greedy senator, that's easy, but this, count me out. - You can't pull out on me now. - It's your responsibility to take care of this city. - I do, I own the city. - I can't risk the publicity. - I'm not talking about publicity. - Getting outta here. - I agree. (dramatic music) - Hmm. - We're closing the operation down. You get the girl, come on. We're getting out here now. - Now? - Now, get the girl. Let's go, now. Hey, listen, I wanna have a little more fun with her, you know. - Are you, what are you, crazy? Get the girl, we're going. Come on, move around. Let's go, we're getting out of here. (men chattering) (upbeat funk music) - Oh, no. You know, you don't stand much of a chance. You realize that. - You'd be surprised. - I bet we would be surprised to take her. I really bet we would be. - Let her go. - You don't have to do this. - I won't say it again. - I guess that makes two of us. (guns banging) - Dak! - Let her go. - All right, what the heck. Nice and easy. Nobody gets hurt. (gun banging) - Feel better now? - Much. - Take care of her, I'm going after Casey. (dramatic music) (door creaks) - [Casey] Is that you, Detective Smith? You know something, they let me go. They're gonna bring in someone else. You and me will be first on their list, you know that? Your partner was no mistake. Stevens was a greedy bastard. He thought the setup was for you, pal. Surprise. I hear you're a good shot, Smith. - So who killed Stevens? - [Casey] I'm not going to jail. Just remember this, you'll be next and you'll never see it coming. (gun bangs) (Dak grunts) (screaming) (glass shattering) Oh, boy. (both grunting) (bones cracking (Casey gasping) - Oops. (Dispatcher chattering) - [Dispatcher] 81 clear. - Everything under control? Where's Sandra? - Paramedics took her to the hospital just for observation. She's all right, man. (Dak sighs) - I tell you, man, there's one piece of the puzzle that's still missing. - You know, I just got a call. Someone's leaving a lot of messages back at the precinct for you. - And who is that? - Some dude named Bobby. He says it's important. - All right, I gotta make a call. - Phone. (phone beeping) - Yo, Bobby, this is Dakota Smith. Yeah, let me hear it, let me hear it, run it back. (Dak sighs) Yeah, oh, thanks, man. Good work. I gotta go. - That missing piece? - Yeah. - You need help? - No, I gotta take care of this myself. - Let's clean this mess up. Come on. (Dispatcher chattering) (dramatic music) - [DAK] So what did you do? Climb out the window and stroll across the parking lot? Right. Crying widow. Well, you need to know, Casey is in jail. You won't be getting paid for this one. - [Lisa] I've already been paid in full. Actually, I was on Casey's payroll long before Paul. We all learned to turn our heads and look the other way for a price just like you could have, Dak. I loved Paul. He was a very, very, very important man to Casey at one time, but then he screwed up. - [DAK] Yeah, right. Paul was no saint. This was a setup, wasn't it? Paul thought it was for me, but it was for him, right? - He died a hero, Dak. That's all a cop can ask for. - [Dak] No, Lisa, there's more, but you wouldn't know about that, would you? (clock chiming) - [Lisa] I can't let you out of here, Dak. (gun clicking) (clock tolling) (guns banging) (dramatic music) - [Dak] I'm out of the department. - You sure about this? Would it help if I told you that there was a subpoena out for Gil Garner? - (laughs) Well, rots of ruck on that. I'm thinking about going into the private sector, maybe becoming another Mike Hamlin or something like that. Watch your back, Chief. - I might need you to watch it for me. Tell you what, though, I think I'll, I think I'll keep this here. Just in case. Give me Detective Cale. Cale, Chief Block here. Listen, I know that you and Smith have had a pretty tough go a bit lately, so I thought a couple of weeks of R and R would do you some good. Also, I think the two of you work pretty well together, so as of now, you and Smith are officially partners. No, I haven't told him. I thought you should be the one to tell him during vacation time.
