Hey my old man, give me a ride! Hey son, I can't today I'm late for the newsroom! I have to finish a story. Take the bike! Then you can enjoy and exercise. Thanks, dad! I've never felt so invisible in my life More than invisible... meaningless. Yep, that's the word. MESSY RAFA #repeatstudent Hated by many Feared by all This giant is coming over to talk to me? Act naturally Rosa, act naturally. #gorgeous Dubious character. Not intelligent at all Wow, big boobs! This is a place of respect. You are tired of knowing that, guys. - We aren't doing anything - Oh, you're not doing anything? You're not doing anything because there wasn't enough time to do anything. Come on! What an unfair world! Like really, really, unfair! Hugging is not a crime, okay? Oh really? I want to see you saying that to Mrs Madalena. - Let's go? - Come on, babe! Of course! The big guy dates the big boogs! First day of class! I bet I'm going to like it! Weird people. I'll never fit it. Hey, what's up? Listen, see if you can help me, miss. I'm looking for my class, It's the ninth year. Hummmm... alright! New student, lost, late. You were supposed to be here earlier, right? Without all this sweat, right? - If you say so... - Not "you"?! Mrs Headmaster Madalena. #headmaster Tough lady Not cute at all #quiet Stuck up Hangs out with messy }#cool guy But hangs out with messy }#geek shy #friendswitheveryone, even Yuri I already like everyone! Whoa, big boobs! Let's see if he can play football. - Ask him to play on our team! - One more for the gang. I'm pretending I'm looking for something so that I don't feel so out of place. I'm ready to have the best conversation of my life! - I'm so cool! I'm nice... - Hey, what's up? I'm not invisible anymore! Yep! "Yep,"? Rosa? - Are you new here? - Yep! Me too! - It's a cool place, right? - Yep! He must be hating me. He is probably thinking I'm the "yep"? snobby girl. Sorry, it's a new school, first day of class. Oh it's ok! We got this! My name is Leonardo but you can call me Léo. And you? My name is Rosa and you can call me Rosa! I's a joke. So I wouldn't say Rosa, that I was Rosa. It's just Rosa! Pure Rosa. Why did I say that? I like her! Shy, but nice. I got it! So, people say this school is great, huh? Teachers are good, the laboratory is top class. The theater is awesome! You're awesome! A L sized cork in my mouth! - Oh, come on! - Sorry, I don't know you. How am I supposed to know if you're awesome or not? It's just a way to talk. First conversation, first day of class, right? Awesome is not the word. I meant you're very nice. You're pretty nice. Where's the L size cork? Professor Fátima! }#portuguese profesweety Loved by everyone - Good morning, Mrs. Madalena! - Good morning! We've talked about these sneakers, haven't we? Yes! True! And I thought I had made it clear last year that you... should use more discrete models, isn't it true? Yes, but... you don't think this is discrete? - Do you think it is, professor Fátima? - I do! I actually did this thinking about this word, Discretion. Right... How can I explain it to you? This way you do not command respect! Your students will think you're their little friend. They will step all over you. Mrs. Madalena, they know me since last year. They like me a lot! Professors are not meant to be liked, they are meant to be respected! And one more thing, wipe this pink mouth, this is not a club. Ok? This is a school. Ok! You are right. I'm sorry. Good morning, students! Good morning! My name is Fátima, most of you already know me but to those who don't, i am the sweet professor of this school. The only one! - What word is that, Fátima? - Are you going to teach Spanish now? No! This is how a ninth-year student wrote "sex"? last year. It was Rafa, definitely! You're laughing, right? But to misspell is a lot more common than you imagine! And that's why I will improve your vocabular! But I need you to read when you're not in school as well, for God's sake! I read, teacher! Books, Julia! #invisibility Is this school right for me? This school is right for me! Hi! Don't look back! Keep walking! Nothing happened! - What's your name? - Rosa! - I'm Luana! - I'm Carol! Nice to meet you! But what just happened? We... saved your life, that's all. Calm down Carol! Rosa, what we did was to save you from some possible trolling from the messy trio. - They are mean! - Very mean! - Like movie villains, you know? - No, no! They are not mean. They are just annoying and think they own the school, you know? A bunch of people are scared of them. If they start picking on you, you are dead! D-E-A-D! Dead! Whoa! So, thank you! What's up, girls! What's going on? Not much! We were just talking to Rosa about the messy trio. Oh, Julia, Rosa. Rosa-Julia. Nice to meet you, how are you? Reeeeally cute, right? Rafa is my crush. Like, the guy I always date, you know? My serial dater. They fight a lot more than they date. They are evil, Julia! So what? I love evil boys that cause fear, that are popular. It's like, good for my reputation to date Rafa. And everyone ships us! RAJU, ok? Ok! So, you date Rafa to get more followers? Of course! Look, I've gotten a lot more followers! Hm! Have you seen what these guys talk about girls? Calm down Carol! Like, any publicity is good publicity, you know? - Come on, take a picture of me! - Ok! Oh my God! Take a good one, ok! Very pretty! Julia is not a bad person! She's just a little... confused in her thoughts, like, she lacks some intelligence. But she's good, a good person! She's nice! She's dumb! Dumb! That's what Luana meant! She is rude to us all the time. I don't know why we hang out with her. Why say that she's dumb out of nowhere? - Out of nowhere, Luana? - Stop picking on her? I'm not picking on her! I'm being realistic! No, I already told you that we have to help Julia. My hours of invisibility are gone! #sweet romantic and new friend! }#hilarious }A bit sincere and new friend! So, honey! Tell me! How was it? Cool. "˜Cool", how? Did you make new friends? Make what, mom? Oh, I love when you make that face! Do you know how you look, besides gorgeous? Cute! Nice! Open to talk! It's just that I don't know if I made new friends! I've met some girls and there's one of them that wow, mom! She has big boobs! Oh honey, don't mind that! You're a board, just like mom! Board? Flat in the front and in the back! Funny, because you have big boobs! Oh, adolescence is such a darling phase! What about the boys? Tell me! There's Léo! He was the only one who talked to me when I arrived. What about you? I talked to him, but pretty cool. Really pretty cool, ok? Ok! What, mom? I don't have anything else to say. Sometimes a girl has to lie! I thought he was kind of silly, even! Oh, boys are silly, Rosa! Actually, boys are silly, and girls are annoying! - Get used to it! - Heeey! I'm not annoying! True! Every rule has an exception! But in this case, I'm not the annoying one! - I love you, ok? - Me too! What's up? You took a while! Geez! I was out in a hurry back home! What did you want? That I skipped class for us to stay here playing a game? No... of course not! So? How was the first day? It was cool! What about the girls? What about them? - Anyone pretty? - No. What was it? You're going to tell me that no girl has caught your attention? No, dad! Can we change the subject? Ok, I'm sorry! - No pretty girl in the entire school? - Dad, this is the same subject! Alright! Just so I don't say there isn't a pretty girl... there's a girl who is a huge hit there. Her name is Julia. - And did you talk to Julia? - Of course not, dad! And... Score! You lost! Poor guy! Hold on! I was distracted here! Hold on! Come back here, dude! Awesome! So hot! Look at this hair! Wonderful! Wonderful. What's the name of the movie we watched yesterday? I think it was "To All The Boys I've Loved Before".? - Yes! - Léo is coming! - Hi, Léo! - Hi! What's up, Rosa, how are you? Hi! I'm good, and you? I'm good! Hm... you know what is it, Rosa? I was thinking about inviting you to the movies this weekend. You, me, Cebola and the girls. Let's go? Let's go! Which movie? Oh, I don't know... an action, a horror movie, whatever. I hate this type. And what do you like to watch? Oh hm... Romantic comedies, lovey-dovey. Like "To All The Boys i've Loved Before"?, you know? No... but I get it. Chick flicks. Dude, you are all so weird. There are girls who cry watching these movies. I cry watching this movie. Really? Well, my mom told me all boys are idiots. Listen, Léo. I'm not going to the movies with you, not today, not ever, ok? Léo gets all red when he "sweat"? Have you noticed, Rosa? When he "SWEATS"?, Julia! The verb is to "sweat"? I sweat, you sweat, he sweats. Good one, Carol! Thanks! I don't care, Carol! What matters is that I think that boys with red little cheeks are really cute. His little cheeks could explode right now! You think so? I think sweating is gross! Not on Léo! He smells good! How do you know Leo smells good, Julia? What, I felt it when he asked me to borrow my notebook during Math class. He asked you to borrow your notebook? Does he know that you're like, really dumb at math? He knows that you're really dumb. Period. You're dumb, Carol! You still didn't get it that I have an excuse to study with Léo! Develop your thought, honey! Luana, sweetie... Now Leo, just like you, know that I'm really dumb at math. That is, there's no problem if I ask him to study with me, right? To teach me the subject. Oh, I'm a genius! You wouldn't be upset, right Rosa? Why would I? You study with whoever you want. No, ok... It's just because every time I see you talking... Like, I'm saying that because I'm really honest, ok? Like, it seems like you flirt with Leo a lot! Of course not! I think Leo is dull in every way! He is zero pretty, zero times one thousand times zero pretty, for real! We got it, honey. And zero charisma and zero style, you know? Zero... Shush! Go, Léo! Unfollow / cancel No way! I'll keep following you because I'm a masochist. I'm not going to give you the taste of unfollowing you. I think you're ridiculous, you know? So ridiculous. You think I like him? You can marry him if you want, dumbass! You are both stupid, right? Perfect couple! You think you are out of this world, he only hangs out with popular kids. You like sweat and he sweats! With an "S"?, dumbass! Dumb and arrogant, right? Dumb and arrogant! Dumba! That's how I'm calling you from now on. You said you were going to ask! - Ask what? - Oh come on, Luana! You said I don't know how to do these things! - And you don't! - Guys, is there something happening? Rosa, now that we're alone, like, without Julia. You can tell us everything, ok? You know that we never... Do you like Léo? Maybe. Of course not! But you're sure you're not in love? And that you don't think about him when you wake up? And you don't dream about kissing that wonderful cute little mouth? You're insane, right? Nope, you're wrong. To begin with, I don't fall for idiot boys... and Léo is a major idiot for hanging out with the messy trio. Do you understand or do I need to draw? Hi, Léo! So cute! What's up guys? Weren't we supposed to do the assignment before the first class? Relax, Léo! Our assignment is ready! What do you mean? Where are you going, weirdo? You know I always wanted to know what's inside the mind of a nerd? Stop, it dude! Stop! Stop! Come on, Rafa! Leave the kid alone! I was just being cool, Léo! And what do you get with that? Leave him alone! What's up with you, Léo? I don't get it. Are you with us or not? You have to be with us for everything or you're not on the team! What's it gonna be? Then I'm out! I don't even have to think twice. This is not the end of it, alright. No one talks to me like that, man. No one! Come on! Don't care about that, ok? You're bigger than that! Now, I want you to gather into groups of five and discuss the adaptation. The positive, the negative points. What did you like, what you didn't like. You begin here, finish at home and give it to me in the next class. All right? Let's do it together! Can I join you? - Hey, Leozinho - Hi! Can I make the assignment with you? I don't know, Júlia. Isn't Rafa going to be mad? I don't want to mess with him anymore! No way! We are over! I'm super single now... Got it... i'll write your name here. Yay! We need one more, right? No way I'm making an assignment with them! - Let's make the assignment together? - Of course! Come sit with us? Be right there! Go! Go! Go! Hurry! Hi! Hi! Come on in! Wow! She looks so pretty! Hi, Rosa! Welcome! Wow, she looks so pretty! Hi, Julita! Julita was awful, I know. We are just waiting for the guys to come over! Rosa, do you like cheese? Is there anyone who doesn't like cheese? Me! I can't even stand the smell! Oh ok! He can't stand it and neither can it! What a crazy coincidence! Crazy and romantic! Are they going to take long? I can't stay late! Wait! Here they are! You're a psychic, aren't you? I have him already, right? - Already? - No but like... almost. He is so into me. He can barely hide it. Let's start, I have a ballet class and I can't be late. - What's up, Rosa! - Hi, Rosa! Hi! - Hey boys! - Hi Julia! Damn! I just remembered that I forgot my book... can I read with you? She's hot, but this perfume... Yep! How can he be so charmed by this dummy? What's up peeps! So, everyone studying? Cool! Peeps? Really? I'm sorry, guys. Well... Peeps, for those who don't know... I'm Leo's dad and I brought, look, a pretty cool snack for you! - Whoa! Thanks, dad! - Wow! You are so cool! High five! That's why Leo is this boy, like... how can I say? He's like... this boy... oh, such a cutie boy! Can I go to the toilet? This is not the school, Rosa. You don't need to ask! Just go down the hallway, it's the last door. What's up, cutie! Come here... I'm curious now, is this the pretty girl you've told me about? Dad! Why do we only like people who don't like us back? Cutie pie? Mommy brought chocolate! - I don't want it, thanks. - What... was it bad at Leo's? Don't even talk to me about this boy. - I thought you liked him. - What??? No, mom, I don't like idiot, ridiculous and clueless people! Wait? What happened? It happened that Leo is a dumbass! Because no smart boy would be interested in Dumba. - Dumba? - It's the nickname I gave Julia. Abbreviation for dumb and arrogant. Dumb? What is it, Rosa, are you crazy? Are you going to call people bad names now? This is aggressive! And unnecessary! And you can stop eating, ok? You're too angry. No, but... it's that, mom... What? Just stop calling people bad names! I didn't raise you like that! What the heck! And don't get stuffed with food, either! Hey, wait, let me take my glasses off. Rosa! Rosa! Come here! I ran into Fátima and she said she loved our assignment! - No way! - It's true! - Well, if she told you... - Oops... did I scare the lady? Stop it, Rafa! Are you insane? Wow Léo, you look pale! Come here, let me put some color on your face. - Rafa, I'm going to call Zuza! - No, you're not, little girl! If you do, you'll be caught in the middle, and you have nothing to do with this story! Stop it, dude! Don't you get it, Léo? This will never stop! You will live in hell forever! You can write down what I'm telling you! What? Do you want to fight? That's it? Say no! - You think you can handle it? - Of course I do! Where? At the old court. One o'clock! That guy is disgusting! Can I help you? No, you don't have to! I'm going to wash, there's drool, breath, spit. Not that I don't like spit, I like it a lot. Spit, actually, only when kissing! I never think about kissing! Maybe I think, sometimes... I'm going to wash it! I'm screwed! Are you sure you're going to fight? I can't let these guys make me a punching bag, Rosa. I'll end this! No! If I don't fight right now, it will be a lot worse later. Trust me! Promise you'll take care of yourself? I will! Stay calm! No... I will only stay calm after this ends. Really? What if I get many injuries? Will you take care of me? I thought Julia was going to take care of you. Julia? Why? I don't get it... Because I thought there was something going on between you two... no? Oh, Julia and I? Come on, Rosa... I have nothing to do with her. She kissed me! I can't believe it! I kissed him! I can't believe it! You have a good punch, right, Léo? Rafa gets into a fight every week. He is more used to hitting someone than you are used to drinking water! You have to know at least how to protect yourself, dude. Look, I bought jujubes! Sugar will be good in case you faint after a punch! Or pass out after seeing blood Stop, guys! You're making me nervous! Do you think there will be blood? Of course! Wait, wait, Léo! You didn't answer. Is your punch good? I don't know, Homero! I never had a fight! - You never had a fight? - You never had a fight? My God, dude! You are screwed! So screwed! Screwed dead or alive and it's my fault! Thanks for the encouragement, guys! Really. You're kidding, right? What's the problem if we go? Every fight has an audience! Ok, but with boys, Carol! Yep, but this time there aren't only boys. - There's Julia... - Is she going? She Always goes to Messy's fights! And one more thing... with Léo winning or losing, today she will get him. For life. And we know that you're not in love with Léo. Not at all! But, as a good friend, you can't let a guy like him hook up with Julia! She says she "bruches" ? her hair, Rosa! - Really? - Really! - Oh my God! - Exactly! And she has this on and off thing with Rafa. Imagine if they hook up, Rosa! Rafa will kill Léo! It's a life and death issue! Life and death, Rosa! - Alright! Then let's go! - Let's go! Messy's hand has the size of a shovel! - Why did you stop, Rosa? - Let's go! I can't see this, guys. Let's stay here, please! Guys, it will start! Rafa is walking slowly and stretching the side of his neck. Flexed his fist, spat on his hand! - He is confident! - Damn it, Carol! Rosa is nervous and you're not helping... UFC vibes! Tension in the air! Heads will roll! You can stop the dramatic narration now, Carol! Okay. }#thefightsabouttobegin Strong punch by Rafa! Léo will die. He won't die but he will end up with an open fracture, for sure! I wonder if running away will be bad? Oh no! This is bad! This is bad! Give up, give up! - Bad for who? Léo? - Of course! - Oh my God! - Oh my God what? Léo's nose will turn into lettuce after this punch. Oh, he has such a cute nose! Had, my friend, because after this one... I want to leave! No... What is this? The foolery has stopped? The show's over? I'll be nice this time and won't say anything to Mrs. Madalena. But next time, you already know, don't you? There won't be another time, Zuza! It's over for me! We already hit and got hit enough. You got hit a lot more than did the hitting, you brat! Rafael, go home now! Walking away! Go, go! You guys, look how awesome my little Leo is, like... Champion in the arms of the crowd! #cutie Awesome, right? He won't leave the house if it's not to win! }Sorry, but this is my bae! }#bae He's loving being the center of attention. And because of a fight. Honey? What happened? Is everything ok? You are so quiet... I don't want to talk. I wanted you to hold me. Am I to old to stay like this with my mom? Come here, honey! Of course not! Never! Never! Hey, dad! Sorry! Did I wake you? No, no way! I woke up to drink some water, I was feeling thirsty. You like to stay there playing the guitar, don't you? Since you were a little boy! What happened? Why the long face? Dad... I'm bummed about this fight today. Everyone was there applauding me and stuff. But now I'm upset, you know? I didn't want to go into this fight with Rafa. Don't sorry about that, son! Its's what I always told you... we don't go out looking for a fight, but we don't run away from it either. That's how things are. It's just how it works, since always. Ok, dad! I know... but I hated to fight! I hated it! And it hurts, doesn't it? - Everything hurts... - Well, son... where does it hurt? The nose? It was nothing, you'll be ok soon. You got hit, right? But you also hit back! Now, let's go to sleep! Forget about this! Tomorrow you have to wake up early! Tomorrow is a new day! Alright, I'm going! He's here!!! Gorgeous! This is everything, everyone thinks you're awesome, bae! No way! He hooked up with Dumba for sure! How long are you going to act like this with me? I won't say anything, I'll just throw you a look of disdain. Yes, I was angry and upset, ok? And I'm going to say it, because if I don't... I will die gagging in a ditch full of slimy bugs! - Alright! - Look, Léo! I even understand that you got into a fight... no, I don't understand at all. Because fighting for me is so primitive, it's something for people who don't think! But is seems like you boys solve things like that, right? So ok! And I don't like to see you fighting... But you know what pisses me off the most? That you're loving this celebrity thing! You're thinking you're the best because of a fight! - But I'm not! - Yes you are! You are all glad that the entire school is after you! This is pretty childish, you know that? It's a brainless teenager who wants 15 minutes of fame thing. Fame that shouldn't even be fame! But ok... Where is all this anger coming from? Can I say just one more thing? I don't know... I've always admired you, but you're acting just like Messy. Broody, fighting. I don't know who you are anymore, Leonardo. Leonardo? I'm sorry... Sorry about the "Leonardo"? And sorry about all of this. No... it's ok! It's nice that you're being honest. But damn, you talk a lot! Carol, we're going home together, right? I'm going home! Anyone wants to make me company? - Luana? - I'm already going with Carol, Homero! - Alright, then! - Let's go! Right, Yuri? Let's go, let's go! Léo! Hm, I was thinking, and like... what do you think about going to the movies with me? No way! It's exams week, remember? Ha! Silly boy! I was talking about, like, the weekend! - It's like, right here! - Oh I really can't, Julia! My cousin will spend the weekend with me! Take your cousin with you! Do you want to go the movies, Rosa? - What? - What is it? Ah... it's ok... it's just that I was thinking about something, like, just the two of us. But you just told me to take my cousin with me! - I did, but... - I'll take my cousin and Rosa! What's up, Rosa? Let's go? To be a third wheel? Of course! You've got a problem with that, Julia? No, it's ok! See you later! Bye, Rosa! Bye, Leo! I'll talk to Léo! Go! What's up, dehydrated candy! Tickle war! - One, two and go! - Stop, Ludmila! What's up, what's the plan for tomorrow? The movies! You, me and uncle Múcio? You, me, Júlia and Rosa. - Who are they? - My friends! Really? None of them is your girlfriend? What girlfriend, Ludmila! What, what's the problem? Everyone dates! Even I have a boyfriend! And I kiss him, ok! You are dating someone? Yes, but no one knows! Not even he knows! Ok! The boy doesn't know you are dating. Nope! I'll tell him one of these days! But wait! Was it a french kiss? Of course not, idiot! I'm only 10! Oh, I'm sorry! - Hi! - Hi! - Where's Julia? - Well, she's not feeling so good! Bad throat, can't leave the bed, poor girl! - So she's not coming? - Yep! Sucks to be sick, right? Especially in the weekend. Yep! It sucks! So annoying, right? Hi! Oh! Sorry! Rosa, this is Ludmila, Ludmila, this is Rosa! Hi! Is she the famous Rosa? Famous? What famous? Not famous! Don't say anything else, ok? Got it! I'll have a large popcorn with lots of butter and condensed milk! It's alright if I sit in the middle, right? - Of course! - Super. - Let's take a picture? - Yes! Now I understand! You are trying to hook up with Rosa! - No! You've already hooked up! - Don't be silly, Ludmila! Come on! Give her a kiss for me! I love to see kissing! But you have to use your tongue! Lots of tongue! Or are you going to say you've never french kissed? No, of course not? I've kissed many boys! Just one! But never mind! Good! I would be shocked if you had virgin lips. Because you know, you're not gorgeous gorgeous! But you're also not ugly! Girls like this always kiss before they're 14! Fact! You're making Rosa uncomfortable, Ludmoron! We never hooked up, ok! Now let's change the subject. Yep, we never hooked up and never will. Too bad! Because Léo is head over heels for you! She's also head over heels for you! Trust me, I know about this stuff. Ludmila, I'm right here! I know! Look at the movie! Thank you, guys! I loved everything! Fathead, let's take her to the elevator! Yeah, fathead! Come on! - No, you don't have to! Not at all! - Of course we'll take you! - Good evening! - Good evening! Well... nice to meet you, Lud! - Bye! - See you next time! Thank you for today! It was amazing! No, thank you! I loved it! So good night! See you tomorrow, bye! Bye! - He kissed, everyone! - Stop, Ludmila! - There was no kiss! - Yes, there was! Let go of me! Let go of me! - Hey! - Hi Luana, I'm so glad you answered! I know that we'll see each other tomorrow, but I don't know if I could wait! So, Léo and I, we... we kissed! No, I mean! Rosa and Léo hooked up! - Hi, Carol! - What? No, it's just that the kiss wasn't a kiss kiss, you know? The kiss wasn't a kiss? No! He just touched his lips to mine! So the kiss was a kiss! Tongue? - Good tongue? - No tongue! No tongue? Are you dating? No! Guys, it was just a clumsy peck on my doorstep! Was it bad? I'm shocked! But why was it bad? Does he have bad breath or a crazy tongue? Guys I'm not understanding anything! Look, tomorrow I'll talk to you in person, ok? Kiss, bye! Rosa is coming! Rosa is coming! Rosa and Leo sitting in a tree! Can someone tell me what's going on? Homero and Yuri drew this heart. And told everyone about you and Léo... - Did Homero know? - Well, seems like it?! Léo can't know about this! It would be worse if, I don't know... Julia knew. I couldn't care less about this girl! Getting less and less patient with this dumbass Hi, Julia... You never fooled me with your sneaky face. Julia, I can explain! No! Be quiet, you don't have to explain anything, because I'm going to explain it to you! You snake! Léo only hooked up with you because I didn't go to the movies, ok? You were like a consolation prize. Come on, Julia, Léo never wanted to hook up with you! Excuse me? Sorry, he never wanted to hook up with you! - And you know why? - Why? Because he sees what everyone sees when looking at you, Rosa. Your gross hair! Your average face! Your ugly jeans! Poor you, Rosa, I feel bad for you! You almost have no followers, right? You are so discredited that not even your parents follow you! Hey... But Léo can say what he thinks about you with his own words. Right, Léo? What's going on? I got here, I caught them saying bad things about me, calling me a dumbass and I had enough! Can you tell me what's happening? - She called me a snake. - She called me a dumbass! - She said I am discredited! - But you are! Hey! Calm down! You are right, babe! I'm not going to lose my temper because of this girl! We didn't hook up! Not only you hooked up... but you said his kiss was bad, right? I never said bad! I said doorstep! - I knew it wasn't bad! - Yeah, me too! I Always knew! There was no kiss! But you just said there was! Come on, Leo, after everything we went through, are you really going to leave me for this "Game of Thrones"? dragon? - What? - Nothing happened between us, Julia. Oh really? What about our conversations? We never really talked! Man, one day you're going to regret this and come running behind me! Will come running "after"? you, Julia. See? Even Luana knows! Julia, how many times do I have to tell you? Leo and I didn't hook up! Rosa is right! No one kissed anyone... Thank you! You see? There was no kiss! Yep, there wasn't..., but there will be now! Are you crazy, kissing here? In the middle of the hallway? If Mrs. Madalena sees that... Get in! Okay, class, open your book on page 74, ok? I'll put this filter here. Can you split then? Okay? Okay, you are all dismissed! See you tomorrow! Look what I sent you! So? Did it go viral? Now! Léo and Rosa! Follow me, please! You see? There was no kiss! }CHEEKY LIES }Yep, there wasn't..., but there will be now! }REBOUÇAS INTEGRATED SCHOOL Is not a place for hook ups!! }EXPUSION NOW!!! Seems like mister Leonardo and miss Rosa believe it is normal... to stretch their tongues in the middle of the hallway, don't they? This video right here destroys the school's reputation. You really think that an innocent kiss can taint the name of the school? Define innocent, mister! Do you want to see the video again? It's not necessary, we've already seen enough! We'll talk later back home Well done... now, due to this lack of respect and shame, - I will suspend both for five days! - Because of a kiss? - Don't do this, please! - Rosa has never been suspended! Mrs, if I don't take any action, this will turn into a club! We have a name to protect! For God's sake! This is not possible! Look, maybe they didn't even know that they couldn't kiss at school, right? - I didn't know! - Me neither! Ohhhh you didn't know! Then probably it's because you didn't read the school introduction book! This is not a mall, where teenagers kiss around without shame! Well, then you should make it clear for the students that making a video to harm two colleagues is far from a cool attitude! That's true! And the "expulsion"? misspelled! This is what taints the school's reputation! Please, Mrs. Madalena, think about it! Five days is too much! You are right, five days is too much! Four days and I won't hear another word! You can go now. What's up, little couple? Were you expelled or suspended? Quiet Rosa! Pretend you didn't listen! I'm not going down to this girl's level! Hey Julia, what was the need to make that video, can you tell me? - How do you know we did it? - We? You too, Rafa? Why? For what? Julia's my girl, dude! Awnnn, lots of love involved, right babe! But listen, how did you know I edited it? We just read what was written in it, Julia. Let it go, babe! You are such a bad person, Rafa! Bad is your situation, isn't it, love? Come on, babe. No, get away Léo! I don't get it... You actually managed to become famous at school! - Why did you kiss me like that? - Rosa, because I like you! Because you wanted to show off! Now everyone knows, we are suspended! Congratulations, Leonardo! We are not a couple! Suspended! Me? Julia or Messy had to be suspended! Oh, kid! Come here! Lay here! The school headmaster applauding a snitch, really, mom? She's all wrong, Rosa! Everything is disrespectful for her. To me, disrespectful is that hairdo! She had to suspend whoever cuts her hair! That's what! What about Carol and Luana? Did they have to tell everyone? Hey, don't live life like this, so harshly, honey! Sometimes things run out of our control, there's nothing we can do! - Mom... - What... Tell me the truth... do you think I was wrong to kiss Léo? I don't... what matters to me is that you are... a good friend, a good daughter, a good student! That's what makes me so proud! Now, there are so many corners to kiss! You couldn't have kissed in a hidden spot somewhere? Mom! Is it Léo? Rosa, where r u? Aren't you going to answer? Forget Léo, mom. I can't even think about Léo, about seeing Léo, calling Léo. Alright, alright! I get it! Ok! Hi! What! What happened? What happened? Really? Because of you our friends got suspended! You think this is cool? If you regret this, do something! Anything, Julia! Are you insane? I didn't do anything wrong! Of course I don't regret anything! Ok... i knew it. Now I'll never ever believe you again! Not me, not anyone! Hi, guys! So, we're making up a... a plan, like, to help Léo and Rosa! - Are you in? - Of course! - Ok, come on! - Guys, pay attention. I have this super idea, Luana and I we had this super idea that will help Léo and Rosa. - Are you in? - Of course! Hi guys! Film my hashtag, go! Hashtag love! - Hi, friend! - Did you like it, Manu? What's up, guys? What are you doing? Can I join? This looks great in the video, Homero! Closer! Yep, I like it! I liked this... Hi guys! Are you making a video? Come to this side over here, come on! Let's go, Messy! One! Two! Three! Kissing makes people happier! What's up? Is the video ready? It is! No one let go of anyone! }loading... }Just posted it! Fingers crossed! Kiss it forward }no kissing #BS }#KISSINGMAKESPEOPLEHAPPIER Kissing makes people happier! Kissing makes people happier! Views Look! It's going up really quick! We've gone viral! Now they've crossed the line! Very good! I just watched the video that you named "kiss it forward"? And my wish is to suspend all of you! But I thought about it, and I better not. I think expelling Léo and Rosa is the best thing I can do! Silence! But this isn't fair! This is not why the guys made the video, Mrs Madalena! Wow Julia! Are you the couple's lawyer? Do you want to be expelled as well? I want you all to know something... square or not. Uptight, or not. I'm the one who rules this school! Me! Mrs. Madalena, they are only students wanting the attention of their headmaster! You still don't understand that they've made this video to defend Rosa and Léo? It's so beautiful to see this union! Anyway... I'm sorry if I'm interfering too much in this! Yes, you are interfering too much! I've had it with you! Excuse me! Rosa, Mrs. Madalena is calling me! Don't answer, mom! She wants to expel me! My friends told me! Honey, she won't expel you! What I can't do is to solve things like this! We have to face this! Geez, our friends got together to help, made a video, the video went viral and even then it didn't work! Rosa, let's make a deal? Let's forget about this? Huh? It's only four days! Please! Come, lie down here. Rosa, I wanna talk to u... Dad, can't you get a story on the newspaper or on tv? Anything! Mrs. Madalena may not be into the internet, but she definetely watches television! I'll try! I have some friends who work on a well known show. Maybe, I don't know, they get excited to embrace the cause! Leave it to me! So, this week a curious case happened at the Rebouças Integrated School. }Two students were suspended because they kissed! }Then their friends and the students... thought this whole thing was unfair }and made a video, right? }Oh, I'm hearing that they were expelled from this school by Headmaster Madalena. What an overreaction, Mrs. Madalena. Don't you all think? Welcome to our wonderful, magnanimous, unique and stunning headmaster! Mrs. Madalena! Good morning! Good morning! As you all know, this school is my life! I do everything to carry on with the work of my parents! Who founded this institution! In the last few days, the ninth year has given me a lot of headache. This "kiss it forward"? thing has irritated me a lot! But every problem brings a learning lesson. I learned something with this problem... I learned that some opinions can and must be reconsidered! Isn't it true? After listening to Professor Fátima, after seeing all the students united! Julia's change of heart and even Ana Maria Braga on television. I realized something that I had never... never realized. That I am educating a very nice group of people. Who worry about their friends. Who fight for them! Who put themselves in their shoes! Is everything ok, Mrs. Madalena? This is why... I decided that I will not give up on two students. Actually, I will not give up on any student! Therefore, Rosa and Léo will not be expelled anymore! Good one, Mrs. Madalena! Now I'm feeling you! See, Zuza? They are feeling me! GRADUATION! Today we celebrate the end of the year! And what a year! Life is really full of surprises! When I least expected, I made huge friends! I've learned that some things never change! Luana and Carol agreeing and disagreeing. Julia is still doing what she knows best... success! And our profesweety is still Professor Fátima! I've learned that some things change a lot! Rafa after a lot of mess... grew up! He became a huge buddy! It hurts to grow up, but it's good! We have Mrs. Madalena to prove it! She made this year, a year of renewal! Next year, the Rebouças school will definitely be a new school! I like this girl! I like this boy! Do you want to be my girlfriend? Yep! Guys! Can I have your attention, please! So, this year I learned that... it's a lot cooler to have many real friends than followers! So, since we're in this beautiful moment... I would like to sing a song to someone that I've learned to like... Rosa, this is for you! One! Two! Three! Four!
