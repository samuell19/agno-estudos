Cape Fox Cub is what they call this place. Just a bit further. Here we are. Welcome to our new home, girls. Huh? Pretty, isn't it? The flowers bloom even with no one to tend to them. I'm so excited to finally live out here. It's falling apart. Goodness. You really outdid yourself getting this place ready. Oh, wow. It's actually pretty nice. In the old days, this end of the house probably would've had built-in stables. All right, you two. Come sit down. Is that a wolf? Never you mind. I promise there are no wolves around here. Now, come sit with me a moment. Now, starting today, the three of us will build new lives together. I'm very glad you came. Thanks, I guess. It's all right. Don't force yourself to speak. Just rest, and you'll recover before you know it. To that point, go grab your bags and relax. I'll need your help with something in a while. My new home. Huh. That better? You alone? What's your name? Okay, never mind. Hey, everyone! We have some provisions here, courtesy of Send a Foods! Some of the packaging is a little damaged, but the food inside is perfectly fine. There we go. Gather round. What do you want? Apologize to that girl. Sorry, but I don't take orders from children. There, there. You all right, darling? Hey, what happened? Now let's get you dried off before you catch a cold, huh? You're just about soaked to the bone. Tanaka, will you get a towel for this young lady? You got it! Such a sweetheart. I feel bad that she's mute. - Huh? - More accurately, she lost her voice. Poor thing's been through terrible trauma. Her parents died in a car wreck around New Year's, and she hasn't spoken since. Not a single word. She had just come to live with some relatives in this area, but then the earthquake hit and well, you know. She showed up here all on her own. Uh, thanks. Now then, Hiyori. Are you excited to get back to school soon? Yoshi, could you lend me a hand? Of course! Hey, you're a high school student, aren't you? Have you gotten to put yourself down for registration yet? Uh, no. I... What's your name, hun? Are you staying with family or... - I'm not. - Where do you live? There's gotta be somewhere you call home. You know what? I'm actually fine. - Wait. - Oh, she's with me. I'm her grandma. Her name is... Oh, it's not Akemi, and I know it's not Sanae, it's one of those trendy names. - Yui. - Ah, there we go. Yui, I knew that. And this little one. Really? Hiyori too? That's right, Hiyori too. You're really her grandmother, ma'am? Of course I am. Why else would I have come to pick her up? You've had to go through so much at such a young age, but you've never once given up. I'm very proud of you. They are my grandkids, but it's our first time meeting. And my memory's foggy these days, so it can take a while for names to sink in. Now, shall we get going? Get your things. Sorry, but may I ask your name first? - I'm Kiwa Yamana. - And you live... There's a place ready and waiting for us in Kitsunezaki. We'll discuss the details soon, but I think it's going to be wonderful. If you girls are all alone, know you have a place with me. Never you mind, all right? It just means don't worry, dear. Looks like it stopped raining too. I was just going with the flow before, but can we trust this old lady? Yui, Hiyori. Could I trouble you ladies to follow me for just a moment? Why? What for? At least tell us where we're going. Ugh! Here. For today, just cut up to the well, then go clean the halls, okay? The well? Come on! Jeez! Is this why she brought us all the way out here? To clean? Um... Do sliding doors usually make that sound when they get torn? Sounds like you're all done. Come see what we're having for dinner. This is urui miso soup. Urui? It all came out of the lawn clippings you two cut earlier. We'll also have mugwort tempura and some wild rocambole. So it's all grass? Well, hold your horses. For our main course, hamburger steaks. Smells good. Then what are we waiting for? Uh, thank you. Pretty good. Don't forget to try some of the tempura too. Really good. And we have milk pudding for dessert. This has grass in it too? Oh, wow. Oh, thank you again. Oh, it was nothing. I never had food like this at home. Why don't you put your things away and hop in the bath before bed? Do you need a change of clothes? No, I have plenty. That's good, but I'm sure you're missing other things, right? So make a list, and we can all go to Masuda Mall tomorrow. Don't let your guard down just because the food was good. All right, Hiyori? There's a story. How's it go? "Kids get lured in with food so a stranger can fatten them up like livestock." Uh-uh. Are you two about ready for your bath? That story I mentioned. If I remember correctly, an evil witch invites these abandoned siblings into her home. She feeds them, then prepares a big pot of boiling water to cook them. Sound familiar? You girls have a nice bath? I guess. What's the matter, dear? This house. Why is it... you know, out here? I mean, look, we don't... I know. Come, sit. Drink some tea. This tea is made from dandelion root. It's good for you. I want to tell you a little story. One that happened back in the days of yore, long ago. - Huh? - It's just a local phrase. Like "in a far away land," or "once upon a time." There once was a small village near the base of a mountain. In this village lived a woman who was absent-minded but very kind. One day, the woman set off into the mountains to collect some butterbur. Determined to find only the best butterbur, she ventured deep into the wilderness, ignoring the rain. Eventually, she happened across the most magnificent front gate she had ever seen. "Oh, my!" She thought. Who would build a house so deep in the mountains? And hoping to take shelter from the worsening storm, she nervously stepped through the gate. "Is anyone home?" She called out, approaching the front door. But there was no answer, so she carefully took a peek inside. The house appeared indeed to be empty, but the hearth was lit, and the most delicious looking feast was spread out, just waiting. "Well, surely there must be someone here," she wondered. So careful not to touch anything, she quietly let herself out to rush back home. Sometime later, the woman was doing some washing by the river and saw a small bowl drift past, shining red and beautiful. She decided she would take it home with her, and use it to measure out rice for her family. And as long as she used that bowl, they never seemed to run out, no matter how much they ate. Why is it, they all began to ask, that we never run out of rice anymore? The woman simply shrugged, and told them of the lovely red bowl that came floating down the river. And, that strangely enough, it looked very much like the bowls she had seen in the house on the mountain. That house was a mayoiga, a place that bestows hospitality and good fortune on its visitors. It's rumored that if you find one, you can take anything inside back home with you. Some believe that because this woman took nothing and had no greed in her heart, this mayoiga gave her that bowl as a gift. From that day forward, her family prospered, and she came to be known as the village elder. Cool story. What folk tale was that? That one's just called "Mayoiga", of course. And they're everywhere. So be sure to keep your eye out for one. I wonder why she picked that story. What the... When did she lay out futons? She was with us all... Huh? This is where I poked that hole before, right? Did that old lady do this too? Oh, are you sleepy? Makes sense. If things go south, we can run. Both of us. Well, good morning. Morning. Did you sleep well, Yui? Probably the best I've slept in a while. It's that weird noise again. Hey, do we have anything to drink? I could make some tea. Oh... Just water is fine. I'd like some ice too! What the heck? What is up with this house? Remember the story? This is a mayoiga too. A house that's hospitable to the ones who enter it. That was real? It repaired the sliding door you tore a hole in, it laid out your futon, and it even prepared the hot water for your bath. Everything it does is for you. This is all for you, you know. Everything I do is for you. I can't do this. Not again. What's the matter? You can't even bother to welcome me home? Welcome home. If you've got time to play house, then you've got time to study. You realize how piss poor your grades are, don't you? What's wrong? Don't like being reminded? If you weren't such an idiot, I wouldn't have to treat you like one, and just maybe your mother wouldn't have left us. Look at me when I'm speaking! It's time you learn some responsibility. I'm only telling you all of this for your own good. Are you okay? Are you hurt? I'm sorry. I just... You don't have anywhere to go either, do you, Hiyori? Yui? Hiyori? Is everything all right? Oh, looks like you took a tumble. I believe this is yours. You're safe here, Yui. You don't need to be scared of the house, I promise. It only wants to help take care of you. The mayoiga would never hurt you or Hiyori, okay? So why don't we go back? Now then, I think it's about time for breakfast. And it's really safe? 'Cause, I mean... The longer we stay, the more the house will improve. If you care for it and speak well of it, it will grow wonderfully, just like a person. I'm sorry. That's good. Is that really all you want? Most girls would want a hair dryer, and other stuff like that. How about some cute new cushions for the sofa? I may not look it, but I was something of a workhorse in my day. I have quite the nest egg tucked away. So don't feel like you have to hold back. Holy crap, that's cute. Why don't we get it then? Huh? You like it, don't you? "Holy crap, that's cute." Uh... Are there any other "crap" things you forgot to look for? That's not really how you use that word, but I don't know. No one's ever spent this kind of money on me before. I don't know about you, but I'm exhausted. Let's go with something lazy for dinner. And here we are. Careful, they're hot. Oh wow, you can really smell the miso. It's just rice balls and pickles today. I got too tuckered out from all that shopping. Well, you did go a little overboard. Like with the rice cake maker? Oh, you think so? Who was it that got that bread maker again? That was only because you said you wanted to try homemade bread. And someone else said they wanted to try my fresh rice cakes. Remember that? What do you think you're laughing about, huh? First day back in a while. What year are you in now? Will you be okay on your own? Oh, wait a sec. Sorry this is partially used, but you can use it to say stuff in class. Maybe I'll head into town today. I'm glad you're back. So then, you're not changing schools? Kana had to move away, so I got scared that you were gonna go off somewhere else too. Makio! Fox dance practice starts today, right? Yeah, right after school. See? What she said. Oh, you should come too, Hiyori. You haven't seen the fox dance yet. That's the bon festival dance. Look who it is. I was just thinking about visiting you girls at home. So, everything going smoothly? Oh, yeah. Let me know if you need help with your change of address forms. Don't forget, you still have to do move out paperwork for wherever you lived before. And how come you're not in school? Oh, I dropped out. Really? I didn't know. Hello, hello. Oh, hi Yoshi! I'm glad to see you looking so well, Yui. Are Grandma and Hiyori doing okay? Uh, yeah. Oh, that's wonderful to hear. I have to get going, but please remind your grandma about the paperwork for me. Take it easy. Is the house treating you all right? I know it's quite old. Yeah, it's great. My great-grandfather used to live there, you know. It had quite a bit of damage, but Kiwa had some repairs done here and there, and now she says it's good as new. Repairs, huh? So, you're all right? I'm kind of the land lady, so please do let me know if you ever need my help. Thank you. We're all good. It is a little out of the way though, huh? Do you have a bicycle? I don't, but the hills would make that kind of a nightmare anyway. Do you have your license? Motorbike only. Oh, do you really? This fine young man is my nephew. Oh, thanks for this. You're good. My old man's gone, and I quit doing deliveries. So if you don't mind it being ancient, it's yours. Um, how much do you want for it? I'm a little short right now, but... - It's fine. - No, I insist. I insist right back. Take it and run. Um, I'm actually in town to look for a part-time job, so when... Oh, that's perfect. Tomoko has been advertising for a part-timer for a while now. Are you in school? - Um, actually... - She dropped out. She came to the evacuation shelter all by herself, but then her grandma came and picked her up. Oh, and Hiyori? She'll get to stay here too, because these two have the same grandma. Wait... So that means, Yui... Which of you and Hiyori's parents were siblings? Uh... Wow, sounds like you've been through a lot lately. I'm afraid I can't offer that much, but if that's okay... Oh. Yeah, thanks, I appreciate it. - Welcome home. - What's up? Where did that come from? Yoshi's nephew that runs a noodle shop gave it to me. Oh! And I got a job. Oh! Send a Foods was looking for some help, so. That's wonderful. What's that? I thought I'd make Hiyori some pancakes. Aren't you sweet. I think she'll love that. My family used to be the head fishermen here. There would always be a ton of fishing boats nearby, and we always had the other fishermen over. Hi, everybody! Oh, welcome home, Reiko. How you doin'? That's my grandpa, and my brother. This is Hiyori. She's the girl I told you about. That's right, you're the transfer student. Nice to meet ya! So, this will be your first fox dance? We could put her on the flute. The flute. Good idea. I'll pull one and bring it to you. I can't wait! Makio, we're ready for you. Roger that. Let's get started. Good afternoon, everyone. Good afternoon! Thank you all very much for making the time to be here today. The summer festival may have been canceled this year, but I remain ever hopeful that we'll be able to hold the autumn festival as usual. Many of us are struggling right now, so let's remain mindful of that, and use this time to lift each other up. That said, let's start with the musical accompaniment. Let's go sit down. Hiyori? Hiyori? And I gotta change the address on my license. Right, right. That's a lot. You can leave all that to me. Uh, but I still need a change of address form for my old place too. And I don't think you can do that when we're not actually related. Never you mind. I'll figure something out, I always do. Uh-huh. Looks like she's home. Huh? Welcome home. How did school go today, Hiyori? What's a fox dance? Now that is a very longstanding community event. It's a traditional ceremony to help drive out evil. The local children dress up like foxes, masks and all, and dance. Why foxes when we're so close to the ocean? There's a reason. And it all began way back in the days of yore. Long, long ago, before this beach even had a name, a monster appeared offshore. An eight foot sea serpent that began to drift ever closer towards the land. When people approached the shore on foot, they were sent flying. When they came by sea, their boats were cracked in two, and plunged into the depths without fail. And when anyone dared look into the monster's eyes, they saw awful, terrifying visions. The villagers all decided they would simply stay away. And then one day, a group of foxes paid a visit to an old man by the beach, who had always been kind enough to share his fish with them. But this time, they brought him a gift. A small knife that could cut through evil. "Use this knife to blind the beast," they said. To support the old man, the village banded together. They played music, and danced with ceremonial arrows, helping weaken the evil he was about to face. Evil that appears in the human world can only be purified by humans. And at the cost of one human life, the monster was finally vanquished. From that day forth, this area has been known to its residents as Cape Fox Cub. So ends the tale. Wow. So that was the start of the fox dance? It would seem so. You ran away? What, from dance practice? What happened? I can't believe she lost them both at once. I heard the man who hit them was asleep at the wheel. Who's gonna take her in now? Apparently she has relatives in Kitsunezaki. Is that wise? I mean, her voice. I heard she was the only one who survived. She's all alone now. Poor thing. Hiyori. Good afternoon! A cat? No farmhouse is complete without one, especially with no dogs in the area. But I couldn't find the right fit. And then this sweet thing showed up. He's soft and friendly, so I thought you'd get along. He does seem sweet, doesn't he? Can we keep him? Can, should, and will. That's great! And I just know he'll be pleased to have found a home. Let's name him Kofuku. Kofuku? Yes. It means "tiny luck." I've adopted more than a few cats in my life, but I always tend to give them the same name. It's a reminder that good fortune doesn't have to be excessive, and we can find small moments of happiness every day. Huh. Hello? Amazing! A real picnic! Well, make sure you eat up, okay? Okay! That's yummy! Want some tea? Huh? Thank you, it smells good. Mm-mm. But you weren't. I'm sorry I was so pushy about you being there. And your family are all shrine parishioners? Oh, yeah. They've organized the festivals for our guardian deity pretty much forever. That's wonderful. So then, do you help out with all the music and dancing? Yes! I try to perform in the summer and autumn festivals every year. Oh, and my grandpa asked me to teach Hiyori the flute part this year, but only if she wants to. Ah, that sounds so lovely. What do you think, Hiyori? Yay, that's great! And so is this! You're so lucky, Hiyori. Do you guys always eat such good food? What are you looking at? Oh, just out at Sodegaura there. There used to be a little Inari shrine on that rock by the caves, but the tsunami almost washed it all away. Looks like they finally came to survey the damage. Where are the caves? You gotta look real close if you don't already know where they are. There's the first one, and the second, and the third one's over there. The third one is huge. It can even fit a Sappa boat. - Which is... - It's a tiny little fishing boat, and the cave is hollow, so on a nice day, you can go in and see how pretty the water is. Cool. You know, there are actually four caves down there. Really? Where's the fourth one? It's so deep, you can't even see it during low tide. I never knew that. The fourth cave is the biggest of them all. Though now I'm certain everyone just wanted to forget it existed. Hm? Well, anyway, let's dig into our dessert, shall we? And Yui, we'll have some company tomorrow evening. We'll need to stock up on more food than usual. Could I trouble you to help out? Sure. How many people are coming? Oh, around seven or eight, I imagine. They're a bit unusual though. What does that mean? Pasta? Yui, can you make some kind of pasta dish? Like carbonara? That sounds perfect. I can't wait to see a bit of your cooking magic. It looks like it might rain tomorrow. Morning, Granny. Thank you so much for coming all this way. Oh, come off it. We just came down the river, it wasn't far at all. This is a matter of the utmost importance, so we're ready to do whatever it takes. But I've never gone diving in the sea before. I wonder if it'll feel the same as the river. At the very least, it's bound to be easier than traveling on land. It's probably just a little salty. Huh? You gave me a fright, my child. Hiyori, meet the Kappa of the Sarugaishi River. - Hello! - The Shizukuishi River. - Howdy. - The Kitakami River. - Regards. - The Kozuchi River. - Hi. - To yo saw a River here. And I'm from the Mabechi River. Good morning. This little one is my granddaughter, Hiyori. It seems she's unable to use her voice these days. I'm sorry to hear that, but don't worry too much. If you just take it easy, it'll be back in no time. You see those three openings down there? There's a fourth cavern just to the left of them. But the entrance is below sea level, so could I trouble you to poke around inside for me? I believe the original cap is long gone, and the shrine was there to replace it, but as you can see, the shrine was destroyed. Ah, wiped out by the tsunami. I see the problem here. You think something has broken free of its seal. - Makes sense. - All right then, let's find out. Yeah. - Let's go! - Alley-oop! It's been a busy morning, hasn't it? I may need both of you to help me prepare dinner today. Were you frightened? And you know they're not evil creatures, right, Hiyori? No matter what we look like outside, the heart matters most. Now, let's go wake your sister. What exactly have we been making all day? It's almost all cucumbers. Well, they're kappa's favorite food. What? Uh... Oh, you're in on it too? So, what's the end game here? Thank you for your help today. We'll have dinner after you wash off the saltwater. I'm sure being in the ocean for that long is rough even for you guys, but I do appreciate it. Ah, there you go. Yui, don't be afraid, but kappa are real. They aren't just things you hear about in stories. There was something I wanted them to check on, so I invited them to dinner. Keep in mind, there aren't many humans who know kappa are real, which means that you and Hiyori are among a precious few. If we're going to be living together as a family, I felt like it would be wrong of me not to introduce you. Oh. I do have to ask that you don't tell anyone about this. But what do you think? Are you angry? Do you feel sick? You look a little pale. How are you, Hiyori? You're not scared? As long as you're okay with it, then I'm okay with it too. What a great big sister. You're sincere and very tenacious. I really love that about you. Now then, back to work. Thank you for having us. Coming through. Sorry for barging in. I wiped my feet. Forgive our imposition. Uh, what they said. Oh, man, this looks delicious! Yeah, thank you. So you were able to enter the fourth cave, right? Oh, did we ever! And man, it's huge in there. And we're sorry to report, it was just as you feared, Granny. We sensed that something had definitely been sealed there. But it must have run off. The cavern was completely empty. I think you were right about the function of the shrine too. That's what broke the seal in the end. All we can do is hope that thing doesn't hurt anyone. Call us again if anything happens. We'll always help. Whoa! What do you call this stuff? It's amazing! Uh, carbonara. It's nice. More like kappa-rbonara. No, no, go get your own plate! My granddaughter, Yui, made it just for you lot. Really? You're a genius, Yui! I already told you, get your own! I'm serious! Give it back! Hey! My kappa-rbonara. You know, I've seen these before, but I've never had the pleasure of trying one. Go eat a cucumber or something! Can say the same to you. So who are you really, Granny? Are we even sure that you're human? All the creatures from folklore are what I call enigmas. And very rarely there are humans who can truly engage and communicate with them. I fall into the latter category. Everybody shut up. I'm gonna sing a song! Don't even think about it. I don't know. That sounds like fun to me. This is a song from a school by my river. I memorized the whole thing. - Here we go. - It's got dogs and cats. It's a really cute song. Oh, it's cute, huh? I hope he starts soon. I can't wait anymore. Here I go. Wait, I forgot the words. Come on! See ya! Everything was delicious! I can't sleep at all. Guess she had fun. Careful! What was that? A snake? Okay, I'm going to work. Oh, I prayed to a Jizo guardian deity. For what? For you girls to get to stay here for a long time. Oh. Thank you. What are you makin'? A few bars of soap. I didn't know you could do that. It's simple. Come smell all the herbs I put in. Oh, wow. That does smell really good. I wanna learn how to do that. Rain check though. I'll see you later. Okay. Have a good day, love. See you next time. Thanks for coming in. Would you mind making a delivery for me? You'd be free to head straight home when you're done. Sure. - Welcome in! - Oh, hey. How are you doing? Hello. I'm glad I ran into you. Those forms I told you about? Turns out they were already done. I guess I just glossed over them. What? Okay. We're really understaffed at town hall. Sorry, Yui. No, it's fine. Send a Foods here. I have a delivery. Great. Thank you so much. Could you just put it right there for me? Sure. That's right. You guys have rehearsal today, don't you? Goin' well? How's the bike treating you? Oh, it's been great. Good to hear. Did you come to observe the fox dance? Or to join it? What? I'm just... It's more exciting the more people we get though. That's great, but I... Teens' choreography involves one of these arrows. Here. Okay. I'm not... Thanks for having me. Sure. See you next week. Girls, be careful going home. The strangest things keep happening. - Huh? - My poor little dog hasn't stopped barking once since last night. One of our neighborhood cats suddenly disappeared, and several people have said they've seen ghosts. You know Murata from the skewer place? He said he saw his late wife at the front door. Darling. Let's get going already. And a few days later, he completely disappeared. Well, I heard Komiyama saw his neighbor even though she had moved away long before the earthquake. You should think about moving too, Komiyama. You won't miss it here. And it wasn't a dream? He said this was in broad daylight. That was kind of freaky. I wonder if it has anything to do with that snake from last night. The kappa did mention that a seal had been lifted from that cave and something might have escaped, but they didn't say what. Who's there? Okay, so there are two of them now. Uh... Yui, Hiyori. Lion-dogs? We're very thankful you two came all this way to help. These lion-dogs guard the shelter's shrine. Oh. They do, huh? They've decided they're going to stay here with us for a little while. So the pointy snakes, what are those things? Vile creatures from the days of yore. Do you remember the sea serpent monster from the fox dance story? It was known as Red Eyes. I'm sure you can guess why. It used its eyes to make people see terrifying visions. Visions of their dear friends dying, visions of long lost loved ones. Anguish was made manifest to torment and drive people away from their homes, allowing Red Eyes to feast on the cries in villager's hearts. Eventually, not a single soul remained. In these places, newly devoid of life, Red Eyes would make its home until it was blinded and sealed away, as the fox dance tale goes. The fourth cave is the biggest of them all. Unfortunately, this story didn't have a happily ever after. What does the part about crying hearts mean? It's just an expression. When we suffer, our hearts cry. It happens to all of us at some point or other. Before you came to Kitsunezaki, Hiyori, you suffered a terrible tragedy, right? And then you went through the earthquake not too long after you arrived. You must have felt hopeless and very scared. What kinds of things go through your mind now, Hiyori? That's very common. Believe me. When we go through something terrible, we tend to wonder, "Why me?" But remember this. It's not your fault, love. Right now, the "why me"s are being expressed in different ways. There's resentment and regret. "I should have done this, I shouldn't have done that." There's the loneliness of losing the people closest to you. There's the guilt of being a sole survivor by random chance. Feelings are piling up, creeping into our daily lives more than ever. Red Eyes is eating our grief and building its power. But never you mind. How so? Hey! What now? What were those? Uh... Follow me into town for a bit, would you? I know it's around here somewhere. Ah-huh, that must be it. Yui, could you turn the light off? I can't express enough how grateful I am that you came this far. This is Tanaka, a Jizo guardian deity from Morioka. But I have to reprimand you for leaving home on such short notice. Morioka is going to fall into chaos without you there. You know that. I had to come, Granny. What if I didn't and something bad happened to you? I couldn't live with that on my conscience. I understand that you were worried, but you do stick out a bit. Surely you know that. Okay, I get it. You don't have to get so mad at me. Oh please, I'm not mad. You know I'm grateful. Though as long as we're here, where have all the others come from then? There's the Jizo of sumo fighting spirit, Zaimokucho's Jizo of business success, the Jizo from Nishine and Hanamaki. The Jizo from Ichinoseki. And the lion-dogs from the Ikkeijima shrine in Miyagi. I think that's it. So then, everyone else is significantly smaller than you are. That's a relief at least. But Granny, with the way things are going, or look like they're going, it won't matter whether we stand out or not. Whenever there's serious danger brewing, we'll all be here to help. You need only ask. I know. And I do appreciate it. I wrote to Kana, but she still hasn't answered. Not at all. She said she was moving to Kanagawa Prefecture, and once she had a new address, she would write me back. But I haven't heard anything from her since. And I don't know if I ever will. I'm scared that she doesn't want anything to do with Kitsunezaki at all anymore. My mom thinks she only wants to forget about what happened with the earthquake. And until then, she can't move on or whatever. I'm supposed to understand, but I'm still here. So is she gonna forget me too? You think so? Hi, welcome in. Uh, Yui? You've gotten so good. You have some real talent, young lady. Oh, welcome home. Did something happen? He found me. Who did? My dad. I, um... I ran away. I couldn't live like that anymore. I was about to break. So I left, and then the earthquake hit, and I keep wondering... why does this always happen to me? It's... It's just not fair. Never you mind. Don't you forget. You're the most tenacious young lady I've ever met. And I truly love that about you. Now then, you get weekends off from work, don't you? Next long weekend, why don't the three of us go visit Tono? Huh? We can get there in this? Yep, that's right. How long is it gonna take? We're going against the current, so it'll probably take a day. - Huh? - Fun, right? Hey, I'll go as fast as I can. Well, don't over exert yourself. Yeah, I'll tag in the To yo saw a Kappa halfway. - Granny! - I missed you! Hi! How is everyone? - Good. - How have you been, Granny? Oh, me? I've been doing swimmingly. Thank you. You've been such a big help. A mayoiga passed through here a few times before, right? If you find one that suits your fancy, you ought a stay put. You know, back when I was a little girl, this forest was my playground. I couldn't have been much older than Hiyori is now. I'd get myself lost, but I'd always find my way. Because this mayoiga is given to wandering the mountains. Huh? Ta-da! Here we are, girls. Isn't this incredible? It's the oldest and by far the most elegant mayoiga in all Japan. Take it in. - Crazy. - I know. And we'll be here a while, so you'll get to explore. Does that kid live here or... Sort of. She's a house spirit. Really? Uh... Oh. The mountain guardians and the mountain witch came. The God of the Home and the Snow Woman. The Boss Spirit from Aomori. The Persimmon Spirit from Miyagi. The Fog Spirit from Fukushima. And the Drop Pot Spirit from Yamagata. And even the Liquor Spirit from Akita. Goodness gracious, looks like everyone is here! Well, this does have all the Tohoku region enigmas pretty worried. This goes beyond Tohoku. Beyond Japan. There's a sense of dread all over the world, and not just for the enigmas. Humans are also worried about areas affected by the earthquake. And they're about to face even more troubles. We believe Red Eyes is determined to run the humans out of Kitsunezaki no matter what. Some of us have discussed hiding out in the mountains near Kitsunezaki for a little while in case we're needed. I wanna go too! Sorry, kiddo. It's too dangerous. Are you going? Be careful. Be careful, Granny! Yes, I promise. I'll be careful. And all you enigmas being there too would give me enormous peace of mind. This was the best trip home I could have asked for. Now then, shall we sit down to dinner? Looks like lamb and veggies tonight. Ah! I'm curious, Yui. What do you want to do? - Huh? - With your future. Have you given thought to what you want to become? Can't say that I have. What are you interested in? What do you think would be fun? Think about it. You don't have to answer now. Let yourself get lost in thought for a while. Eventually, you'll come across something you can't live without, just like we came across this mayoiga. When you do, you'll know you find your calling. So it goes. Find what you can do, then do whatever you can. This is nuts. Well, she did say we'd be here for a while. You don't like it here? Do you wanna go home? Back to our chatterbox mayoiga? Makes sense. I know how you feel. It's pretty nice to have a safe place we can actually call home, isn't it? Thank you both very much. So the time has finally come for me to use this. Take care of my girls, all right? Find her? Come on! Open up! Open the gate! Open it! You have to. Never you mind. Never you mind. Open up! We have to find Granny! We have to go to her! When we met, I was so scared, and she tried to protect us all by herself. I wanna at least try to be there for her, even though I don't have any special powers. 'Cause we're a family now and I love her! Thank you. All right, here we go. What is that? No! The heck is that about? Yui! I found you, finally. Hi, Dad. I've been worried sick. You didn't have to leave me so suddenly. You know you can always talk to me if something's bothering you. Why are you so quiet? I'm speaking to you! We're going home. Stay away! You're nothing but a parasite! Makes sense. I know how you feel. It's pretty nice to have a safe place we can actually call home, isn't it? Yui! Yui! Wait! Yui, please come back! You can't leave me! You can't leave me, you said we were a family, didn't you? You told me we'd stay together. Yui. Yui! Yui! - Hiyori? - Come on! Let go of me! I have my own family now, okay? I have little sister! We're going home. No, I'm safe here. And I'm going stay here, because this is my home now! So let go of me! Leave me alone! Big sis! Oh, my gosh. Hiyori, listen to you. I can't... I can't. Your voice is so cute. You can call me big sis anytime. Okay. You scared me. I scared myself too. We better go. We have to save Granny. Mm. Yes, of course. I should go. There's nothing for me here now. This knife won't work. Ugh. Everyone's grief is out of control. It's too powerful. Granny! Oh, hey, you. Granny's in trouble. Hop on. But what can we do against a monster like that? Whoa, isn't that... Granny! Are you hurt? Jizo guardian Tanaka! Will that fire spread to the town? Not on our watch. I believe Red Eyes fired at the mountains to trap our reinforcements there. Everyone's working hard to keep the flames at bay. It's huge. How are we supposed to beat it? Think, Yui. Find what you can do and then do what you can. To support the old man, the village banded together. They played music and danced with ceremonial arrows, helping weaken the evil he was about to face. Yui, this way! Hiyori? Everyone has fought so hard. Was it really all for nothing? This is something I can do. Hiyori? I wonder... Hiyori! Now, here's something I can do. Here it comes! Get ready! It seems no one in town remembers what happened. That's quite a relief. Kind of a weird place to be enshrined. Well, perhaps Red Eyes had something it needed to cry out too. So now what? Are you gonna stay here? Go help other enigmas? Granny! Oh, you're awake. You slept for quite a while. I was afraid your eyelids would stick together. I'm happy to hear your voice. Don't go. Promise me. Please stay with us, Granny. Ah. I too lost my parents early in life, and the support of the enigmas was invaluable. But after traveling here and there for so many years, it's nice to settle down. So unless you two decide that you want to leave Kitsunezaki, I'll be right here. I think even if I do leave here, I'll always come back. I really love this place. Just feels like home, you know? Granny, can we go back to Tono? I want to play with the house spirit, and thank the kappa for all their help. And I want to see the lion-dogs and Tanaka again. Hm. Sounds like you love the enigmas as much as I do. Mm. I am your granddaughter. That you are. I recall that back then, I was around your age when I first met them. They may be unusual, but who's to say we're not? And if you keep that in mind, the friends you make now will last the rest of your life. I guarantee that. Huh. So, do you think Hiyori's gonna grow up to be like you? It certainly wouldn't be a surprise. She is my granddaughter, so she's bound to take after me. That reminds me. There's something I want to show you two. It's a cherry tree. I found it washed up on the beach, and I planted it here. I thought it deserved a chance to grow nice and strong. And look, now that it's found a home, it's taken root, just like us. Do you think it's gonna bloom? Of course it will. And it's going to be beautiful.
