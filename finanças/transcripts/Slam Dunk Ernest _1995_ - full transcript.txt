Shoot it! Yea! - I got him. - All right, let's go. Over here. Over here. Emile! Emile! Okay, do it again. Come on. - Oh, no! - Ernest? Pass me the ball. Ernest, pass it to me, okay? Ernest, no. I know what you're thinking. Don't shoot it. It would be better to just pass me the ball. Ernest, don't shoot it! Whoa! Are you okay? I'm real sorry. Oh! You all right? - Yeah, baby, yeah! - Hey, yeah. - See that? The grace? The agility? That's it. That's basketball. It's like a romance with the ball. It's... It's like a dance with the hoop, know what I mean? So I guess you think you can take it to the hoop now, Ernie. Yo, you think you could jam like that? Yeah. Don't get him started, all right? If you fellas would just give me a chance, I could show ya. I'm a player. I'm a jock. I'm in the zone. - You're in the zone all right, Ernest. - Yeah, the Twilight Zone. Brother, I'm gonna let ya in on a little secret, Ernest. You're short. Short! You remember Yoda? Well, you're kinda Yoda-ish. And you're clumsy, Ernest. Very clumsy. You're not just white, baby. You're whiter than white. You're a redneck! - Right in the back. - Guys, guys, that's enough. - You crazy, Ernie. - Let's go. You, too, Ernest. All right, guys, come on. We got work to do. Hey, fellas? Last chance to buy some lottery tickets. - Ahh. - You can win lots of money. - Stay away from me, woman. - Oh, come on. - Uh-uh, baby, no way. Not on that scam. - Hi, Erma. Hi. Snap out of it, man. She is way out of your league. - Come on. Stop whinin'. - Ohh. Okay, let's wrap her up, folks. Last autograph. The mall is closing. Tomorrow we gotta be in L.A. for a Lakers game. I'm so sorry. Bye-bye. Thank you. Bye-bye. - Make sure he's on time. - Yes, sir, Mr. Moloch. Hey, big guy, good job. Nice shoes, huh, kid? Yeah. If I had those shoes... If you have those shoes, you'd have the edge. Everybody plays, but the winners... They have the edge. Really? - I'd give anything to have those shoes. - Now you're talkin'. Kid, desire is 90% of the game. If you want somethin', you just gotta go for it. Yeah, if I just had those shoes. We're out of here, Barry. Don't forget the alarm when you're done. - Right, Chief. - What's up, Quincy? Later on, Chief. - Hi, Dad. - Quincy, get on home. See ya at the house. Gentlemen. It's show time. - All right. - Oh, yeah. Here we go! Let's hustle. City League Tournament starts tomorrow. Mr. Moloch and the other scouts will be watching us. Whee! All right, let's do this, let's do this, let's do this. Let's do this. Let's do this, baby. Let's do this. Let's do this again. Oh, let's do this, baby. This is your medicine woman... Dr. Love on the mighty WUSH. Oh, my Nubian sister has a voice from heaven. I'd like to send this one out to Laquita and Tommy... Chantelle and the King, and to the players on The Clean Sweep. Go, baby, go! Whoo! All right, come on, baby. Go! Let's do it again. Come on, baby. Let's get a free throw for Willie! Come on, you guys. Hit me. Hit me. Hit me. I'm in the open. Open does it. Hit me. I'm the baby. I'm the boy. Hit me. Yeah! Good play. Okay, here I am. Over here. Yeah, good. Willie, up here. Hit me. Come on, Willie. I'll drop it in the pocket. Hit me. Up here... I'm drivin' toward the west. Ohh! Hit me. I can't miss from up here. Hit me. I'm Air Ernest. Spider-like reflexes. - Keep it up. Move it up. - T.J, watch it. Are you crazy? Mr. Ellis paid a fortune for this sculpture. Now check it. Mr. Ellis need to get his money back. Come on. Come on. - Ernie, no. Do not shoot the ball. - Don't shoot it, Ernie. No, no! Shut off the sprinklers. Turn the alarms off. Forty-six, please respond. Mr. Worth, we are looking at major damage here. I want to know what happened, and I want to know now. - Right now. - Yes, sir, Mr. Ellis. You see, we were... Uh, it was rats. Giant mall rats. Thousands of 'em. Swarming all over the place. I would have stopped them, but... Mall rats. Well, maybe it was aliens, disguised as rats. Thousands of 'em, swarming all over the place... - Silence! - Shh! Mr. Worth, The Clean Sweep is your company. This is your responsibility. Yours. Yes, sir. Mr. Ellis, it won't happen again. You bet it won't. I'll see that it doesn't, Mr. Ellis. It was my fault, Mr. Ellis. Barry told me to watch what I was doin'. - I'll pay for the damage. - With what? Well, you can take it out of my pay. His pay. Fine. Tell Legal to garnishee his wages for the rest of his life. Thank you, Mr. Ellis. You won't be sorry. I believe you gentlemen have some mopping up to do. Whoa! Watch your step, Mr. Ellis. You didn't have to take the heat on this, man. Yeah, I mean stickin' your neck out like that? That's serious biz, homie. - Thanks, Ernest. - Yeah, for real. You stepped up, Ernest. Totally uncharacteristic of your kind. - We owe you one, man. - Yeah. We owe you, Ernest, so if there's anything we can do to repay you... you just let us know, all right? - Yeah, sure. - Well, there is one thing you could do. Sure, man. What? You could let me be on the basketball team. No, no, no, no, no. - You trippin'. You definitely trippin'. - We think not. Well, I just wanna play basketball with you guys. You know, round ball, hoops, hit the hardwood. A cog in the lean, mean basketball machine, know what I mean? No offense, Ernest, but you see, we're a well-oiled machine. Yeah. We've been playin' together for like, what, 12 years. - Five. - Nine - Seven. - Two. I just wanted to play basketball with you guys. You know. I just, like, wanted to be one of the guys. - Hey, don't even go there, Ernest. - Please. Uh, look, guys, come here. All right, guys, we do owe Ernest. But he'll never play with us. He'll just dress out, okay? He just wants to be part of the group. You heard him. Think of him as a mascot. A mascot? Why can't we have a smart mascot? Yeah, like a goldfish. Because we owe him. All right, Ernest. You can dress out, but you're gonna sit on the bench. All right? Do you understand? Oh, oh, thank you, Barry! Thank you so much! Thank you! Oh, I'm your humble and obedient servant. Oh, thank you so much. Thank you, guys. Thank you. Thank you so much. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. I'm tellin' you right now, Ernest, you better not make us look bad either. No. That's right, 'cause even when we lose, we look good. Yeah. - We do not lose. - Ever. No. Ernest, Ernest, he's our man. If he can't do it, no one can. Yea! Ow. Ow! Ow! Hey! T.J, are you ready? - You know I am, home slice. - Say what? I said home slice, you know I'm ready! Unh! How 'bout it, Walter? Are you there for me, brother? I'm with you, black man. Don't even worry 'bout it. Uh-huh! Worry is a drone emotion, my brother. Now I've always said that. Step. - Tommy T! What's it gonna be? - Nothin' but hoops and alley-oops. Let's do it. Ah, the men's locker room. Tank of the titans. Temple of testosterone. I'll bet you guys are male bonding as we speak. Right on. - Out of state. - Be cool, Ernest. - Frozen. - Ernest, grab a locker, man. Yeah, in another room. Don't come near with all that trippin', Ernest. Me trippin'? I'm not trippin'. I'm on solid ground. What you talkin' about some kind of solid ground? T.J. - What he trippin' though? - I know. Ernest, there's your uniform. I'm goin' to warm up. My uniform. This is the proudest moment of my adult life. You must've had less of a life than I thought. - Lose the hat, Ernest. - It's probably bolted to his skull. Yo, T.J, we out there, all right, man? All right, man, I'm gonna catch up. Hey, Ernest, check it out. Take your time. You got all the time, like about an hour. Right. This is Dr. Love, your medicine woman of the air... on W-U-S-H, "Wush." Tonight I'm broadcastin' live from the first round of the City League Tournament. Clean Sweep and Krader Construction will have the tip-off... right after this brief message from Lonnie's One-Stop Market... the place to go when you're in the know. Yeah, so tell me, Dr. Love. How do you feel about unrequited love? Isn't it bad for your health? Well, you see, baby, I wouldn't know about that. My love never goes unrequited. - Excuse me, brother. Excuse me. - Oh, yeah. Uh-huh. Don't play yourself like that. Oh-so-fine perfection of a black woman... if beauty were a minute, you'd be an hour. If beauty were a flower, you'd be a rose. If beauty were an automobile, you'd be a solid gold Rolls Royce classic. Girl, sign my head. Ohh. I will never wash again. I didn't think you ever had. - Oh, please, baby, go easy on my man. - Oh, she wants me. - Oh, yeah, you smooth. You smooth. - She don't got to be so... This is Dr. Love, and we'll have the tip-off right after a brief message... from Evan Jones Auto repair. Take your time on the shot. All right, guys, huddle up. Now, watch that big cornbread-fed-lookin' brother over there settin' picks. When that happens, T.J, you switch with me. Uh, Barry? Not now, Ernest. Walter, look. You can't muscle that big, ugly forward, man. Barry. Big Foot even try that, I'm out on that mother. Just be cool. And, Willie, you got to hit the three tonight. If I believe, I can achieve. Barry. Not now, Ernest. 'Cause that'll free up Tommy T. in the lane. If you can't hit it, I'll hit the three. I'll be there. - Barry. - What, Ernest? I made lemonade for the whole team. With real lemons. It's not the mix, not the powder. It's the real stuff See, it's still got lemon peel floatin' in it. Okay. Thanks, Ernest. - Everybody, in here. All right? - Let's do this. Clean Sweep! Go, team. It's right over here if you want it. The Clean Sweep takes the floor here at the City Memorial Gym... and we are ready to go. All right, fellas, want a good, clean game. Watch the rough stuff and the handshakes. Okay, ready? Freeze. Action photos for everybody's locker. Ernest, I want you to sit down on the bench and don't get up, you hear me? - Over here on our side? - Yes, over here on our side. Oh, sorry. There's bad blood between these two teams. - Last year's game ended in a bench-clearing brawl. Yes! The Clean Sweep are playin' their hearts out. They have the stuff it takes to win the City League Tournament. And there goes Barry Worth again to the hoop. Yeah! Go, Dad! Yeah, baby! Barry, Barry, he's our man. If he can't do it, T.J. can. T.J, T.J, he's our man. If he can't do it, Walter can. Yea! Give me a "W." - What are you doing? I don't care! - Give me an "A.' ' Uh, give me an "I." Give me another "I." Yea! Give me a "W." - Give me an "A." Give me an "I." - Man, where's your head? The Clean Sweep can't seem to keep their mind on the game. Their cheerleader seems to be distracting them. Barry, Barry, he's our man. - If he can't do it, T.J. can. - Push up, T.J. Push up, baby. T.J, T.J, he's our man. - If he can't do it, Walter can. - I got Pillsbury Doughboy out here. Give me a "G." Give me an "I." Barry, Barry, he's our man. What a chump team. Give me another "I." Time out, Jake. Ernest! - Give me a cursive "R." - Ernest? - Yeah, yeah. - Sit down and shut up! Go, team. The Clean Sweep have gotten things straightened out now... and everything seems to be on course. And there's another two points! Two, four, six, eight. Who do we appreciate? Ah! Was it somethin' I said? Now that The Clean Sweep have had their huddle... we're back to regular play. That a way, Barry! Yeah, baby! Here we go. The Clean Sweep are leading going into the third period, and they look too fine! Dr. Love! This one's for you, baby. Ooh-hoo! Now Willie Haskell is goin' on three. - Yours truly. - Ahhh! Ooh! You showboat like that again, I'm gonna put Ernest in for you. - Oh, that's cold, Barry. That's cold. - I'm serious. Come on, baby. Let's go. Quick. The ball was in bounds, and the Sweeps steal the ball. There's the pass to Walter, then to T.J. The Sweep are tryin' to work it in. Barry Worth takes the shot, and there's three points! Switch. Switch! The Kraders take it down the court. Whoo! There's two. Clean Sweep! - Two, baby! - Clean Sweep! Clean Sweep! - Yo! Play ball! - Get it, man! - Let's go! Let's go! - It's close. Way too close to be comfortable. The Clean Sweep are lookin' like dust mops right now. Time. Back. That's what I thought. Time out. Okay, guys, huddle up. Willie, don't foul. Your man does not miss from the free throw line. - Barry. - Walter, if we get the ball... I'm gonna hit ya at half court. Dish off to T.J. T.J, don't take the three. Barry. - Take it all the way to the cup, baby. - Barry. - Draw the foul. - Barry. What? I just want you to know if you need a rest, I'm fresh as a daisy. My fingers are just aching for that high-arching three-pointer. Ah, that's okay, Ernest. Savin' you for overtime. Shrewd. Very strategic. Well, I'll be your secret weapon. I'll just sit over here on the bench... like a coiled cobra, throbbing with power. It's anybody's game now. It's been a touch-and-go game since the start... but The Clean Sweep are playing... like the true athletes they are, and I definitely like true blue athletes. Beautiful! The Clean Sweep leading by one with only ten seconds left. - The Krader Construction work the ball... and the clock is tickin' down. Here they come. This is critical for Krader Construction. - Technical foul. Sweep. Two shots. - No, Ref, he's not with us. - He's a mascot! - He's not even from this planet. He's wearin' your uniform. That's a technical foul called on The Clean Sweep. - That's it, Ernest. Come on, man. - No, no, T.J. - Let's go! It's a technical. - Line up. - What is he doin' playin' with the balls? - -It's all right. ...Yeah! Yeah! Yeah! You, you, you! And there's the buzzer. In a bizarre ending, The Clean Sweep lose by one. But it's a double elimination tournament, so don't throw in the towel yet. Good night from WUSH. You made us look bad. I'm sorry. I... I told you, Barry. Are you just lucky, or is that a God-given talent? - It was an accident. - Save it. - The towel... - Ernest, even I find this irritating. I'm sorry. Barry... I know, Ernest. You let me down, man, that's all. I gave you a uniform, and you lost the game for us. And you didn't even play. I've got more lemonade. And I had double prints made of those pictures. Gosh. I just wanted to be one of the guys. Part of the team. Maybe go out for a pizza after the big game. Talk about super plays. Talk stats and belch out loud. That kind of a thing. But I guess it was never meant to be. Why me, Lord? Why me? Why you? Who are you? I'm the archangel of basketball. Angel? Angel? You mean like the little guy with wings and the bow and arrow? No, man, that's Cupid. This has got to be a mistake. I got the wrong dude. Wait a minute. The archangel of basketball. Oh, no. This is it. The big one. I've committed such a grievous sin against basketball... that you've been sent here to take me out of the big game. For good. One technical foul and I'm a dead man. Get a grip, man. You're not dead. God doesn't take people out for a technical foul. Look, how long have you been playin' ball? Hour, hour and a half. I was supposed to deliver you a pair of shoes. - But these definitely aren't your shoes. All right, all right. I'll give him the shoes. Here. Enjoy the shoes. Thanks. Remember one thing, Ernest. Don't misuse the shoes. Right. I wonder where Barry and them got that guy. Okay. You can come out now. Ha-ha. Very funny. I get it. Team initiation. Yeah. Now it's time to blindfold old Ernest... and paddle him. Well, fun's over. I'm outta here. I'm leavin'. Get back in there. Hey! Ha! - Bee-bee! - Uh, yow! Ah! Ow! Yow! Hold it, hold it, hold it. Let's just go through one shoe at a time, shall we? Okay. Thank you. No, no, no. Off here. Let me here. No. No, but... but... Brake. No, but... Brake, brake, brake. All right, stop. Brake, clutch. Okay, out of the car. Out. Wait, you guys. Make up your mind. Who's gonna drive? You operate the gas. You operate the brake. But not at the same time. Oh, come on, you guys. Don't get ahead of me. Ah! Come on. You're not in a Gene Kelly movie. Oh, hold on, you guys. I'll let you in. I know the guy that lives here. Come on. I'm gonna have to paint the door. I know the three of us have had a long and tiring day... and I, for one, could use a little shuteye. With your cooperation. Thank you. Ah. Well, now let's pop these puppies off and... Okay. Stay on. Look, you two. I'm going to sleep now... and my legs are going to sleep with me. Do you understand? Good. Thank you. Oh-owwwww! Owwww! Ah! Yah. Ohh. Wow. If I just had those shoes. - Hey, boy! I say, I say, boy! - Hey, Dad. - Hey, Dad? - Yeah. Can I have some new shoes? Son, I just bought you new basketball shoes two months ago. Yeah, but I want some new ones. Utopian Flights. They've got 'em all over the mall. Those $250 pair of showboat shoes. You think they're gonna make you a better player, don't you? - No, but they'll give me an edge. - An edge? You know what gives you an edge, little man? Huh? Hard work. Hard work and practice. Yeah, right. So you've worked hard. You played every day of your life, I bet. Yeah, guess I have. So where did it get you? Listen, I made a mistake, all right? I could have played college ball, and I could have gone pro. Listen to me when I'm talkin' to you. But I messed up. I dropped out of school, and I didn't get an education and that was it. So because you messed up, I can't get the shoes? No. No. Because I messed up, you can't mess up. Thinkin' you need things you don't. You're listenin' to the wrong people, son. Well, when you're older, you'll understand. When I'm older, I'll end up just like you. Now let's go to our sports center. And the Hornets announced today they will play a very unusual exhibition game in two weeks. The general manager revealed plans to play an exhibition game... against the winner of a City League tournament. Some of the City League players have got pro-league-caliber talent. But these boys don't play for money. They play for blood. The NBA meets the streets, and I'll be there with bells on. Did you hear that? Did you hear that? The Hornets are gonna play the City League champs. Hey! I finally get a chance to play in front of the pros. I gotta call the guys. Jackie. Jackie! Hey. Hey! Chance to play the pros, man. Oh, yeah, baby. And I'm finally gonna get some competition. Why y'all so chipper? We ain't gonna make it. - What do you mean? - Yo, what's up with you, Barry, huh? Did you forget that 150-pound, scrawny, Gilligan-lookin' dodo bird you saddled us with? I can deal with him. Yeah? Like you dealt with him last night? And where's Ernest anyway? I guess the brother's afraid to show, huh? Yeah, well, he better be, if he knows what's good for him. Right behind you. I'm right with you. Hang on. Okay, I'm here. Now what? Come on. Be reasonable. It's dark, it's cold and I've gotta go to work. Okay. Yaaa-haa! I don't know how many more of these personal appearances they want you to... Excuse me. I'll catch up. Well, hello there, Miss Terradiddle. Hi. You wanna buy a lottery ticket? You can make a lot of money. Oh, really? Tell me. How does it work? Well, you see the little waxy bit here? If you rub off two in a row, you get lots and lots of money. And if you rub off three in a row, you get even more money! Want one? Ernest, where have you been? Sorry, Barry. Sorry, fellas. I just had a little trouble gettin' out of bed... safely. Yo, fellas, will you check out homeboy's feet? Yo, Ernest, you didn't pay $250 for those shoes, did you, man? It seems as though Ernest's economics have been significantly advanced. Uh, no, actually, somebody gave them to me. I can't believe it. A grown man. You're as bad as my boy. All right, let's get started. We got a half an hour... if we're gonna get out of here in time for the game. - Not tonight, you're not. - Hey, Sarge. Uh, we got started a little early. We got a game... City League Tournament. Mr. Ellis said if this place doesn't shine like new... you guys are looking for a new gig, and I don't think... the City League pays its players. Gotcha covered, Sarge. Like you had me covered the other night, right? I'm going to eat, and when I get back... if you're not here and this mall isn't shining, don't bother coming in tomorrow... because you've lost your contract. Do you understand, Barry? Yes, Sarge. I'm outta here. I ain't gotta take this. There's a million jobs better than this. You can do anything you want, T.J, but I got a wife and a kid. We're gonna miss the game. What about that? You wanna forfeit? This is totally unexpected. I've got an idea. I'll stay. I'll finish up. Your ideas are gettin' better, my brother. We be killin' two birds with one stone. Yeah, he stays, we play, we win. - Mm-hmm. - You can't do this on your own. I won't let you down this time, Barry. It'll be clean; I guarantee it. And the team needs to win this one. - Come on, man. - Really. - Let's do it. - Oh, yeah, that's what I'm talkin' about. Let's go play some ball. I'm countin' on you, Ernest. What was that? Oh, don't worry, Barry. Everything's under control. Don't ever do that again. If they hear you talkin' to me or me talkin' to you... Oh, uh, hi, Miss Terradiddle. Just doing some yoga stretches, you know, for the team. Well, uh, going home for the evening, huh? Yeah, goin' home, Ernest. You, uh, thinkin' about goin' to see the guys play? Well, I don't really like basketball that much, Ernest. Unless there's somebody playin' who I really like. Um, say, how come you're not playin', Ernest? Well, uh, I'm kind of a secret weapon. They hold me back until the stakes get really high. It's just City League, you know? It just seems more fair that way, kind of evens it up. Know what I mean? Yeah. I guess so. See ya later, Ernest. Bye. Bye, Miss Terradiddle. We'll do lunch. From the moment we met... I knew it would just be me... and you. Tryin' to play hard-to-get, huh? Ah, sweetheart, they're playing our song. The one we danced to in that smokey little club in Tangiers. Come. Let's dance like there's no tomorrow. Oh, Erma... you, burning with desire... and I, alone, heartbroken... scrubbing an empty mall. And there's the tip-off The Clean Sweep are a picture of form and grace... as they put the first points on the board. - Yes! Ha-ha! - Push up! Push up! Look out, Willie! Hey, get him in there! Yeah! Yes, I do windows. The secret of success is the polish and the power in the player. And the hang time. Oh, yeah. The Hackmore Antiques look like little old ladies out there... against the slammin', jammin' Clean Sweep. Dr. Love! This is for you, baby. Come on, Willie. Take him, Willie. Take him! - Ohh! - Whoo! - Showboat. - Mr. Razzle Dazzle. - Come on! - Ow! Barry, I can't let that man play the second half. Find another player or you forfeit, you understand? - Okay, Jake. - Okay. I don't believe it! They don't call us The Clean Sweep for nothin'. - I feel like slappin' you. - Ah! - I feel like slappin' you. - Ah! - What, do you want to forfeit? - What else are we gonna do? Hey, you guys are winnin'! What are you doin' here? You're supposed to be back at the mall to cover for us. - I finished. - Yeah, right. No, really. Sarge came back. He was impressed. Ernest, I trusted you, man. I wouldn't let you down, Barry. - I don't believe this. - Wait a minute. Play Ernest. - He's a registered player. - I'd rather forfeit! Look, Barry, you gotta play him. If he left the mall, you lost your contract. You wanna lose the game too? Barry, look. It won't work. How we gonna win with an Ernest? - It's gotta work. - It'll work. If I put you in the game, you promise to stay out of the way? - Your wish is my command. There's the buzzer. Let's play ball. So, is it forfeit, Captain? No, sir. Our sixth man showed up. Let's play ball. William Bacon has joined me on the WUSH mike. His substitute is an Ernest P. Worrell. At 5'9" and 143 pounds, he's averaged no points... no rebounds and no steals. And one technical foul. Okay, fellas, let's have a good, clean half. Twenty-eight, watch the handshakes. Ready? Whoa, whoa, whoa. Wait a minute. Okay, Ernest, I want you to stand right here. I don't want you to touch the ball. I don't want you to do anything, okay? Explaino comprendo, el Capitano. - Ready, Captain? - Let's play. - And there's the tip-off! - Get it, Ernest! Get it! Ernest! Ernest, why didn't you get the ball? - You told me not to touch it. - Well, I know I said not... I mean... Look, if the loose ball comes to you again, just pick it up... and throw it back to me, okay? Clever. Red ball out of bounds. Hackmore Antiques brings the ball in. It's one try at the hoop, a miss and there it is! Two points for Raymond Boyd of the Hackmore team. This game has been a seesaw of points... as each team struggles to edge the other out. There's the throw in, the pass way down court. It glances off the number 17. It's out. Way out! - Barry! Come on! - Oh, yeah. - Did you see that? - All right! Wow! Yo, baby! Let's go, baby! I'll get it, Barry. - Thanks. - My pleasure. - Yeah! - Way to go! Way to go, Ernest. Ya! Go, Ernest! - Get it, Ernest, get it! - Okay. Yes, Ernest! Yes, Ernest! You have to see this man to believe him. Ernest P. Worrell is all of 5'9"... It's nothin' short of phenomenal. Rebound! Rebound! - Go for it, Ernest. - Really? Yes! Ernest! You're the best, man. There's the buzzer! And that's the game. Yes! -The Clean Sweep has made a marvelous comeback. Yes, Ernest! - Way to go, Ernest! - Throw another one like that! She's here! - She came! - Ernest, come on, man. Come on. Let's go! Ernest! You're the best! Hey, Uncle Walter. Give me some right there, Dad. All right, punkinhead. - Who's that doing all the jumping? - Ernest. Did you see what he did? He's incredible, isn't he? Yes, quite. Quite unique. He must have something very special. I wonder what it is. The shoes. Ernest, I've always thought you were a dumb redneck. Always. But let me tell you somethin'. You one dumb redneck who can play some ball, baby. - Good game, Ernest! - Thanks, T.J. Ernest, you were awesome, dude. That last shot was incredible. Well, thanks, Quincy, but I learned that watchin' your dad. Excuse me, fellas. I don't mean to interrupt. I just wanted to say good game, Mr. Worrell. I'm Zamiel Moloch... and I believe that you are extremely talented. You have played one interesting game, son. And I think that you are going to become a very wealthy man. I'll be talking to you more. I got my eye on you. Oh, and looking forward to watching you fellas play against the Charlotte Hornets. That is going to be one very interesting game. Congratulations. I'll see you later. I bet that was one of those pro scouts or sports agents. Looks like a sports agent to me. Mm-hmm. And you know what? He said he has his eye on you, Ernest. - You. - Yeah, he did say that, didn't he? Yeah, and he can't wait for us to shut down the Hornets, baby. Shut 'em down. Shut 'em, shut 'em down. - Wicky, wicky, wicky. - Everybody, just chill. We still gotta win this tournament. Just gettin' ahead of yourselves. Ain't no stoppin' The Clean Sweep, Barry. - Now that we got the redneck. - Ah-ah. Now that we got Ernest slammin' and jammin'', baby. Was I slammin' and jammin'? You almost looked like me. How 'bout some of that lemonade to celebrate with? Whoa! Yeah, the real stuff, not the mix. The kind with the peels floatin' in it. Fresh. Thanks. All right, come on. One on one. Let's go. Yes, Quincy! Way to hit, babe. You ain't seen nothin' yet. We're just warmin' up. Hey, put that up again and I'll shove it down your throat, little squirt. I told you. Don't mess with the big dog. All right, I got a dollar. I got a dollar. - All righty. - Thanks. - Here you go. - Thanks. - Thanks. - Yeah, my pleasure. Get down there, you squirt. And how 'bout you, little brother? What do you want? I want $250. Let me rephrase that. What do you need? I need new shoes, so I can have the edge. Maybe you should look for it in the right place. Huh? Come on! Whoo! Put it on, baby! Put it on! - Go, Dad! - Oh, yeah. That's all it is. Two, baby. Let's go, baby. Go, baby! Yeah! Yeah! The Clean Sweep are chewin' up the Kik-a-kee Smoked Fish... and spittin' them out in this one-sided competition. - Ernest! - I got it. - The Clean Sweep are unstoppable. - Slam and jam. Coke, please? Sir. Oh! Six. It's tiptoe through the Tulips as the Clean Sweep... travel through the garden of the Tulip Brothers' failed defensive plan. The City League teams keep burrowing away as Ernest flies to victory... with The Clean Sweep as the ground crew. Could I have a dog, please? Thanks. Thanks. ...The boy! The boy! Welcome to another Thursday night... and The Clean Sweep are at it again. Whoo-hoo! - Yeah! - Go, Ernest! Go, Ernest! Go! - It looks like in just a few moments... The Clean Sweep will be off to play the pros. Hang time. And The Clean Sweep wins the City League Tournament. Yeah! Whoo-hoo! They are the City League champions! - Good game. - Big E! - Yeah, baby. - Big E! Yeah! Yeah! - Yeah, mama! - Oh, yeah! What? Now what's the matter? Erma comes to the game to see me... - and you won't let me enjoy a single minute of it. Are you jealous? You can't be. You're just a pair of shoes. I'll call her. That was low. So, think you're smart, do you? Well, watch this. I showed you. Let's see. T-E-T-T. Terradiddle. Terradiddle. Terradiddle, Terradiddle, Terradiddle, Terradiddle. Three pages of Terradiddles? They must have settled the area. D-E-E-E. Erma! Erma G. Terradiddle. No! Uh-oh. And now for the winning lottery numbers for the $10 million jackpot. Six-four-three... eight and two. Those are tonight's winning numbers. Hello? Uh, uh, hello, Erma? Uh, this is your B-ball star, Ernest. Oh, hi, Ernest. Gosh, you were so good last night. You hear that? Uh, gee, thanks, Erma. Uh, listen, Erma... I was just wondering, ahem... since we won the, uh, the tournament and all... if maybe you'd be interested in... ...going to the, uh... victory, uh, celebration dinner with me. Oh, Ernest, that's so thoughtful of you. I mean that you would think to invite me to something so special. I'm so flattered. But I can't go. I have to sit with my poor old grandmother, who has the chicken pox. You understand. Well, yeah, sure. I-I understand, Erma. I mean, your grandmother can't go out in public... with all those little pimply things all over her face and stuff. I'm so sorry. Maybe some other time, huh? Y-Yeah. Maybe when the-the boils clear up. Yeah, when they scab over. Yeah. Well, uh, bye-bye. Bye. So how'd I do? You did just fine. Do you really have the winning lottery ticket? Oh, yeah. - Can I see it? - First, a little lesson in... temptation. Oh, wow. Oh! Thanks. Put it up! - Hope you're winnin'. - Yeah! I'm beatin' the Hornets by six. All right. Let's just hope the real thing goes the same way. This is my chance, man. Pros are finally gonna get to see what I can do. They won't be looking at you, Dad. They'll be looking at Ernest. I tell ya, I was never really hurt. - So why was you cryin' then? - Hey, Kevin. - Hey! You are the man. - What up, Cap? What's up? What's goin' on? Hey, is this everybody? Everybody but Ernest. Brake. No, clutch. No, brake, brake. Come on, you guys. I know, I know. It's a big night for me too. Okay, okay, that's it. I'm operatin' the gas and the brake with my hands from this day forward. Now calm down, both of you. Stop. Good. Danzo's. This is it. I loved the ambience. I loved the salmon. Wasn't the salmon wonderful? Oh, it was delicious. - Good evening, sir. Valet? - Oh, the keys are in it. - Oh! - Oh, I'm sorry. It's not me. It's these shoes. - Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey! - Hey, hey, hey! Wow. I've never been in a restaurant without a drive-through window before. Right this way, Mr. Worrell. Ooh, fancy. Look. Real cloth napkins. - Whoa. - Nothin' but the finest, my brother. As they say in Rome, to the victors go the spoils. We don't want the spoiled stuff. Shouldn't the victors get the fresh stuff? - Mmm! - Oh, come on, Ernest. Let's eat. Some fine champagne, huh, Mr. Worrell? Ha-ha! Hey, hey, hey, hey! I'd like to propose a toast before we begin. Okay now, The Clean Sweep have come a long way. Well? - And we have fought an uphill battle. - Uh-huh. But there's been one man that saw us through. I'd like to propose a toast... to the most valuable player of The Clean Sweep... Mr. Ernest P. Worrell, my man. All right. Go, Ernest. Go, Ernest. Get busy. Go! Go! Go! Go! Yea, Ernest! Ho! Whoo! - Ernest, can I have an autograph? - Uh, yeah, sure. Mine or somebody else's? It's the shoes, isn't it? - Huh? - It's the shoes. Uh, no, no. Uh, it's the Worrell moves. You know. - It's that hit-and-run method... - What a lovely moment. This is wonderful. Excuse me, fellas. I hate to intrude like this. Erma? - Erma? - Miss Terradiddle? - That's Erma? - Oh, Ernest, you're the greatest. Oh, you are so exciting. But, Erma, what about your grandmother? Oh, lucky for us, her pox scabbed over. Yeah. Lucky scabs. Ernest, when I'm close to you like this, my heart beats so hard. Can ya hear it? Yeah, I think so. Listen, guys, I need Ernest for about ten minutes, okay? Ernie, baby, got some very important people for you to meet. It'll only take a minute. - We'll take a short limo ride. - Ah! Limo? - Like in limousine? - Mm-hmm. - Does it have a TV? - Oh, it has a wide-screen TV. These are very influential people waiting to meet you, very influential. - Very. - Very. - Influential. - Very. Very. Come with me, you big hunk you. Ernest, won't take a moment. This way to the limo. - Does it have a Jacuzzi? - With lots of bubbles. Funny guy. I mean, I love this guy. Come on. Come on. This way. Ernest, your life is about to change... and all your dreams are about to come true. Oh! Ow! Oh, I'm sorry. - Ernest, what's the matter? - Come on. Not now. Oh, just a little dance fever. Come on. We gotta talk about this. Stop it! Now. Ahem. We're going to walk over there and get in that limo... and we're going to behave ourselves, or we're going to walk through the dog poop again. Good. Cured. Miss Terradiddle? Allow me. - Oh. Ha. - This happens to me all the time. After you. Ow! Oh, I'm sorry, Miss Terradiddle. Really, I didn't mean that. Ernest, I think you're gonna like this. Golly, bob howdy. This is bigger than Waylon's limo. - Nothing is bigger than Waylon's limo. - Nothing. Ernest, there's no doubt in my mind you're gonna be a major star in the NBA. Gosh, I don't know about that. I'm just... No, you are a star, Ernest. And you'll be making a lot of money. - Oh, yeah? - It's a done deal. You're on your way. What a glorious future you're gonna have. Gosh, just think: me, a star in the NBA... playin' basketball with the big boys. Yes, and you'll be making lots of money. - Lots? - Cash. Ohh! Fine champagne, huh, Mr. Worrell? Just think of it. You will be adored by fans. You will take their breath away with each move of those million-dollar legs. You will be a sport phenomenon. Your fame will be respected throughout the world. Over the whole big, wide world. The media will eat you up like ice cream. Don't misuse the shoes. - Everyone will want to eat what you eat. - And drink what you drink. And go where you go. - And they'll give you even more money! - Yeah. Over the school, around the pizza joint, off the twins' trampoline... through the double wide, nothing but net. But it's not enough just to play like a star. You've gotta look like a star. - Look like a star. - And you can... because you're so gorgeous. Yeah, gorgeous. New for this fall from Armano Giorganni... the complete Ernest line for men. Here comes Ernest now in a flash-scare ensemble... that hails to the grandeur of the Ottoman empire. Yes, your man will say, "Golly bob, I don't know how to thank you"... when he puts on the comfy, virile look of Ernest. I don't think that outfit goes with the shoes. Money, money. And me. And more money. And me. And more money. - And me. - Listen to her. - Stay out of this. - Ernest... you can have anything you want. - Yes, Mr. Worrell. Anything. - Oh, yeah. - And you. - And me. - And money. And you. - And money. And me. - And more money. And you. - And more money. And me. - And more money. And you. - And more money. And me. - And more money. And you. - And more money. And me. - And more money. And you. - And more money. And me. And more money. Ernest, why don't you tell your friends... that you can't work tonight? Oh, I don't know. I usually stay and help the guys... You're the star, not them. You're the only one anyone cares about, including me... and don't you forget it. Ooh, I just love those muscles. - Come here. - Whoa, oh, oh. - Good boy. Come on. - Uh, yes. - This way. - Yes, I'm right here, dear. Here's a good boy. Come on. I'm right with you. Okay. Here. Let me get the door. - Ow! - Oh, you're all right. - Yes, I am. Yeah, how silly. - Come on. Hey, Ernest! Yo, Ernest! What's up, my brother? Looks like Ern's been distracted. Got his hands full. Can't see us right now. How was the limo ride? Did you have a TV? - Yeah, but no cable. - Where have you been? We waited at the restaurant, and now we have to finish these floors. Or have you forgotten that we play the Charlotte Hornets tomorrow? He has some unfinished business to attend to. You see, gentlemen, when you're a star, you not only have to act like a star. You have to be a star. So I'll catch you on the court, sport. Man, oh, man, Ernest got it goin' on. You would too if you had hang time long enough to grow a beard. - Get back to work. - Whoo! - Ernest. - Did you see, baby? Come on, Quincy. It's way past your bedtime, mister. Put your bike up and go on to bed. I bet Ernest doesn't have to go to bed. Put your bike up. You know, Quincy, Ernest has to work just as hard as the rest of us to play as well as he has. Hard work has paid off for Ernest. - Quincy. - Come on, Dad. Ernest put on those shoes and blew you... And all your hard work away. I'm going to bed. Hey, hey, hey, Quincy. - Come on, guys. Let's do it. - Man, I can't believe... we get to the biggest game in the history of the planet and Ernest bugs out. - All right, guys. - They don't look too happy. Of course they're not. It's a waste of their time to come down here and kick our butts. And now, ladies and gentlemen... the moment you've all been waiting for. It's the mighty magnum of basketball brilliance. It's the hippest hoopster of the hardwood. It's the blizzard of the backboard... the alpha omega of the hoop world. It's the hardest-working Cracker in basketball. What is that? - It's Ernest! - It's Ernest, man. My main man! Ernie Ali Al Worrell! When did Ernest become a Black Muslim? Ernest! Here. Allow me. - Yeah! - Okay, guys, let's huddle up. All right, listen. This is an NBA pro team. Now, we're gonna start out in the two-three zone, see which way they're comin' from. - T, I want you to throw the ball in. - Barry. Barry, please, spare us the strategy rap. All you have to remember is to throw me the ball. Feed me the pill. Pass me the rock. And leave everything else up to me. Know what I mean? This is Dr. Love at the sidelines, pitchin' the pro game... straight to ya over WUSH. One, two, three, go! And the Hornets have taken the floor. - Okay. - Let's do this. Oh, yeah. Let's go, Clean Sweep. The Clean Sweep take their position on the floor. And it looks like the Hornets are ready for this game, as their center comes to face... our own Ernie Ali Worrell. And there's the jump ball. Holy flash! Did ya see that? That's right. And that's the first two points with Ernest dunkin' the ball... with enough hang time to write his name on the backboard. Oh, yeah. The Hornets bring the ball down into Sweep territory and set up a play. Hey, T. baby. T. baby. Oh, yeah, my man! This guy is awesome. Is the ball in the air yet? I'm clear! I'm clear! I believe so. And there goes Ernest. Hoo-whoo! That was a three-pointer. He turns it into a two? Come on now. Way to go, Barry! A little gump dunk. Was that fantastic? The crowd is enthralled with Ernest P. Worrell. And he is so gracious to his adoring fans. What you got? Huh? I gotcha. You can't go around me. Oh, no! - Thirty-two. Run number two. - I got it. Don't you love team sports? Ernest is determined to crush these Hornets all by himself. Oh, Ernest! This just in on exhibition games around the country. The Charlotte Hornets are getting trounced... by a City League team who call themselves Clean Sweep. This is unbelievable. The score is 36 to 4 in the middle of the second quarter. How can this be? A City League team knocking the daylights out of the Charlotte Hornets? And it's all because of one man: Ernest... Ernest P... Ernest P. something. Ernest... Ernest P. Worrell. He is being a one-man team in this match... and the Hornets have nothing to combat this fly guy. Let's take you to the action where our travel cam sports crew have just arrived. This is absolutely the most incredible thing the sports cruiser has ever seen. This Ernest character is literally punishing the Hornets. They're not happy about it. Their coach is not happy about it, and it looks like... Ernest's own team is not all that happy about it. There's the half-time buzzer... and what a half it's been. My, oh, my. Ernest, you look like NBA material out there. That's because I am NBA material. How did you manage to outscore an entire pro team? Quite nicely, I thought. You got a wonderful future. What are your plans? That's it, boys. That's enough. I've got to go freshen up now. We'll do lunch. Ernest, Ernest, what are your plans for the future? No, really, that's all. Thank you very much. Thank you. Hey, you guys. We're really trompin' 'em, huh? - We ain't doin' nothin', Ernest. - Yeah. - You doin' it, Big E. - You doin' it all. Well, hey, I thought if we could win this game... - We just gonna watch you play. - But we're a team. Define "team." We don't wanna make you look bad, know what I mean? Excuse me, Air Ernie. I could make some lemonade. Ernest, you're the greatest. You're the best player in the whole world. - Well, what about your dad? - Ah, he's nothing... and never will be. But you're a star. When I grow up, I wanna be just like you. Hey, Ernest! That's the buzzer. Come on. Hurry up. Come on, man. Did ya hear that? Now, on top of everything else, I've turned this little kid against his dad. - Yeah, some star. Oh, yeah? Well, you were partly to blame. - If you hadn't acted so high and mighty and... But if we do that, we could lose, and... Well, I guess it would help Barry and little Quincy. Ouch! Ow! Ow! Stop squeezin' my toes. Okay, okay. Stop it. Okay. Okay, I'm with you. Okay, wait. - Well, when's he comin' out? - Who cares? The Clean Sweep take the floor, but where's the man of the hour? Where's Ernest? There he is, ladies and gentlemen. The man! The superstar! Ernest, we love you! Ernest flips to Barry Worth. Worth passes it back to Worrell. Worrell to Worth, Worth to Worrell, Worrell... It's stolen! What's wrong with you, man? Take the ball and shoot it. And the Hornets score! - What's goin' on out there? - We got it. What has happened to this Clean Sweep team? The star, Ernest P. Worrell, keeps passing the ball off. All right, all right. Over here! T! T! Off! Off! Way to go, Barry! Okay, rebound. I got the rebound. Move! What's with you? Stop 'em! - Good idea. - Shoot it! Shoot it! Oh! Oh! - Yeah, yeah! All right! - Get out of the way. We comin' back. We comin' back. Man, I can't believe this. - Get this close. - Wake up, Ernest. Look, wake up, brother! Wake up! Unh! - He's not wakin' up. - Oh, yeah, he will. Watch this. Ow. Yeow. Ouch. That hurt. Come on, Ernest. Snap out of it, okay? We gotta finish the game. Now come on. I can't. You guys do it. I'm hurt. Uh, old football injury. Redskins. You know. Come on, Ernest. We can't win this thing without you. Sure, you can. You guys can win it. You're a team. You're a basketball machine, remember? You guys can do it. Hard work will do it. You're right, Ernest. Let's go, guys. All right, let's do it. Hard work, baby, hard work. - Clean Sweep! - Let's do this! The Clean Sweep team has taken the floor without their star, Ernest. Stand by. We may be switching to midget racing. The Hornets have come back hard and fast... without Clean Sweep superstar to stand in their way. Things are turnin' out for the worst for the boys in blue. What are you doing? You're kissing a $5 million contract good-bye? You're a star. You can't quit. You're blowing the whole deal! - I blew the whole deal. - What? You were on the top! What do you want? Anything. You name it. The world can be yours, man. Just finish the game. I wanted to be on the team, and I'm not, and it's my own fault. - What about me, Ernest? - You're not what I thought. You're making a big mistake, Mr. Worrell. No, I'm not. Now get away from me and leave me alone. - Oh, Ernest. - Both of you. Get away from me and leave me alone. You are going to be very sorry. What is he doing? Ernest is givin' up his shoes? Well. I guess he thought it was the right thing to do. Willie! Hey, Willie! Come on! - I got up. I got up! - The Hornets have it again. The shot. Oh, off the rim, and Barry Worth on the rebound. He's down the court. He's up there. That's two for the sweep! For what it's worth, it's Barry Worth. He is reachin' deep. He just blew off two of the best defense players of the NBA! Barry is keepin' the Sweep on top. Go! I taught them everything they know. - T.J! - What? What you talkin' about a foul? You gotta wake up and watch the game. That wasn't no foul. What are you talkin' about? When was it a foul? And with just five seconds left, T.J. Wilson has fouled out. T.J! Come on, T.J. - T.J! - T.J, just chill. Ernest, you gotta come in, man, or we're through. Yeah, Ernest, go on in. - I don't know, fellas. - Ernest, it's what you must do. Come on, Ernest. But what if I cause us to lose and we look really bad? Ernest, that doesn't matter, because you're part of the team. You mean I'm really part of the team? Yes, you're really part of the team. You mean I'm really, really, really, really, really, really... really, really part of the team? - Really. - Really. - Really part of the team. - Okay. - All right. - Clean Sweep! - All right, baby, let's go! You're really on the team, Ernest. Hurry. Go! I'm out of here. Come on, baby, go! Here we go. Seconds to go, and the Hornets lead by one. Barry Worth has done an amazing job leading the City League champs. Barry Worth is definitely an NBA-caliber player. - Come on! Pop it! - Right here! Ernest! Shoot! Shoot it, Ernest! Throw it up! Shoot the ball. Shoot the ball! I know what you're thinking. Don't shoot, Ernest. It would be better if you passed the ball. Shoot the ball! Shoot it, Ernie! Don't shoot it, Ernest. - Shoot the ball. - Ernest, don't shoot it! Yeah! Yeah! Clean Sweep does it again. Boy, yeah! Baby boy! All right! Way to go, Barry. That was quite a game you played, Mr. Worth. Thanks, but the rest of the team, they played great. I mean... We'd like to talk to you in private, if we can. Sure. Why? We're a couple of pro scouts, and we're always looking for a talent like yours. - Come on, son. - All right! Yeah, that was great, wasn't it? Yeah, we won it! We did it! We did it! Ha-ha! I'm sorry I took these shoes. I just saw 'em, and I couldn't resist. I'm really sorry. So, you figured out that I was after Quincy all along. I had that kid the moment he laid eyes on those shoes. But you didn't see Ernest coming, Zamiel. - You lost big time. - I gotta hand it to you. Usin' the yahoo with the brown hat and the magic shoes. That was brilliant. I was totally blindsided. I figured you'd be up to your same old tricks. They work most of the time. But not this time. Wait a minute. How did you know Ernest would make the right decision? For that matter, how did you know Ernest would become Quincy's role model? - You cheated. - It's chess, baby. I was three moves ahead. But... But I had help. I'm not sayin' I did this on my own, you know. You won this one, all right. Maybe the next time Quincy crosses your path... he'll recognize you. Enjoyed the game. 'Til next time. Shall we take our leave, Miss Terradiddle? Say, you wouldn't happen to know where the Phillies are playing this week, would you? Didn't think so. Oh, for you, my dear. - The winning lottery ticket. - Oh. For me? Ooh. Will I make lots of money? Oh, yes, very expensive money. - Anybody else want some Clean Sweep? - Ha-ha! I always knew. We swept. Just pass me the pill and I'm ready to go. - Finally gonna get my shot. - Hey, Dad! Hey, hey! What's up? - Did you win? - We did it. I knew you could do it. I'm proud of you. Hey, where you been? Doing some very hard work. Let's go home. Ah, the sweet smell of victory. And all it took was my spider-like reflexes... my dazzling hand-eye coordination... and, of course, a little fancy footwork, know what I mean? Wah! Ah! Ahhh!
