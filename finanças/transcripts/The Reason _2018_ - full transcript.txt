Subtitles by explosiveskull My name is James Lindy. I've been blind for 45 years. In 23 days, I'm gonna get my sight back. A miracle. As a pastor, I don't know how many times I've been asked where God is when bad things happen. The answer, whether you can see it or not, he's in the same place he's always been. With us. You've got your coat on. I've got my purse. We are all set. And afterwards, we can get those donuts with the sprinkles. Mmm. Yay. His sleeve was polka-dotted with blood, and he tried to hide it from me, so I think it's probably been happening more often. We don't hide things from your mother, Alex. Sorry, Ms. Lindy. No, I won't do it anymore. You promise? I promise. Okay. What are you looking at, honey? That you, Shirley? Who I been talking to? There was lightning last night. I saw it, and it was really, really scary. I wasn't scared. Good. How long did it take you to become a nurse? I'm a doctor. And it took a really long time. What kind of doctor are you? The best kind. Who's your favorite superhero? I really like Wonder Woman. She's okay. I like Spidey-Man. Oh, well, I guess Spider-Man is pretty awesome. Don't worry. All superheroes need to get tested. Why don't you tell me about the lightning last night? You're obviously very brave because you didn't get scared. Did you watch it with your mom? I watched it with my best friend, Charlie. Yeah? Lightning hit my cross. Lightning really hit it. We live over at Saint Thomas, and lightning split our cross in half last night. Wow. Yup. And we're done. Good job. - You get a Band-Aid. - Good as new. We'll call you as soon as we get the results. Thank you. What's that one say? - "Stop." - Mmm-hmm. Mmm. What about that one? "Ellis Street." - "Ellis Street." - Mmm-hmm. And that one. "Banner... "Tire... "and Auto." Who taught you to be so smart? "Only believe." - What? - "Only believe," right? Yeah. Yeah, that's right. - Thank you. - Hey. Hey. Hi. You, uh, you waiting on someone? Not anymore. - Mind if I sit? - Please. What's your name? Kaitlyn. Yours? - Todd. - Nice to meet you. Can I get you anything? - What are you having? - Tequila. - Two of those. - All right. So, Kaitlyn... Tell me how your day went. It is ridiculous how loud it is in here. I don't think they make silent jackhammers. Well that's... That's funny. Hey, question. What do you know about Mrs. Springstead? Is she the one that's in a coma? Yeah. Her husband brings her flowers every day. - Yeah. - I ran into him this morning. He didn't have any flowers. He says, "Well, I guess I won't be seeing you anymore." So, naturally, I assumed that Mrs. Springstead finally died. I mean, what else was I supposed to think after 22 weeks on life support in a coma? - So she died? - No, Kaitlyn, she woke up. Singing. Singing so loudly that it got up half of B-wing with her. That's impossible. No, she shouldn't be able to walk. That's exactly what I said, but get this. Zero atrophy. None. I mean, by all accounts she was as healthy as the day she was admitted. Unlikely. I can't figure it out. I mean, um... Maybe she was having spasms during her coma, something to keep the tissue from atrophying. Hmm. Anyways, here's Brad Walker's labs. Thanks. Wait, what was she screaming again? Oh, uh, something about believing. I don't know. Hey, maybe I should publish a paper, huh? Is he her doctor? I think in his mind. Hey, Jim, did the hospital call yet? Well, I haven't heard it ring all day. What did that insurance fellow say? They said they don't cover acts of God. - You believe it? - I'd rather not believe it. Well, looks like we're gonna be stuck with a broken cross for now. Well, that's the insurance company for you. Mmm-hmm. Guys, what did I say about roughhousing inside? Sorry. Oh, I know you didn't mean to. Do you know who this is? That's your grandma, and that's me when I was about your age. What's that? Well, Grandma was wearing that necklace the day that she and my dad died. I haven't seen it since. Oh, baby, come here. Oh, come on. Shirley? Shirley, call a doctor. Mom? Hey, Dr. Lewis just wants to make sure everything's okay. Alex, there is somebody who really wants to meet you. Hold on one second. Hello, Alex. My name is Mr. Brave. That is, Percival Farnsworth Brave III. But you can just call me Mr. Brave. - It's very nice to meet you, Mr. Brave. - Mmm. Enchant√©. What do you do around here? Well, I'm a liaison of sorts between Nurse Kaitlyn here and Dr. Macey, and, well, you guys. Alex, do you know what the word "liaison" means? - No. - Neither do I. But it makes me feel sophisticated. Okay, okay, Mr. Brave, I need a favor. Could you ask Alex if his hip feels warm or cold? Hmm, yes. Alex, does your hip feel warm, or does it feel cold? I heard what she said, Mr. Brave. Tell her it feels cold. Hmm, yes. Alex, now is the time to be brave, okay? Tell me what I wanna hear Tell me there's nothing to fear Tell me that I lose my head So listen to my heart instead When I'm held in the arms Of this waking fear... Your body is made up of all these teeny-tiny little cells, and they're everywhere. They're in your hair. They're in your skin. They're even in your tushy. Now, healthy cells know when to stop growing. When a cell has cancer, it doesn't know when to stop growing. So, you think we should... We should start chemo right away? Yes, I do. And with leukemia, it's possible to find bone marrow matches, so I'd like to test you right away. - Does Alex have siblings? - No. And what about his dad? His dad's not around. Well, if you can find him, we need all possible matches. Yeah, sure. Alex. I want you to remember one thing. Can you do that? Your mommy, Nurse Kaitlyn, and I are gonna give you the very best care possible. And Dr. Lewis is the best. Am I messed up like the cross? No, baby. You're perfect. You know what? I'm gonna put flyers up around the hospital and see if I can't get people to volunteer to help fix your cross. Is that okay? I'm not a carpenter, but I'll try. I mean, can I come? Am I invited? - I think it's okay if Nurse Kaitlyn comes. - I can use a hammer. I don't know about that, but I guess we'll find out. My feet are growing weak But I'll keep watch while you sleep It's the world on my shoulders It keeps getting colder So rest your soul on me The road is blood and dust So be mindful who you trust They may rob you and take you there A head nod, is that the new way to say hi to people? What's your name? Kaitlyn. I'm Kenneth. Nice to meet you, Kenneth. I wanna show you something. I wasn't expecting an apple. - No? - No. Who just carries an apple in their pocket, right? I guess you do. And I'm probably gonna hear why. - But it's a nice apple. - It is. No, pick it up. Look at it. Okay. - What do you think? - Well, it's a really nice apple. What if I told you there was a worm inside that apple? Well, I wouldn't eat it. - No? - No. A lot of us have some things inside of us that are eating us up. Things that make us believe that we're rotten. Eventually, although it seems impossible, we have to learn how to let all that go. I get, um, what you're saying, but I don't understand your point. I think you do. It was very nice to meet you, Kaitlyn. Well, it was intriguing meeting you. A little confusing, but... But nice. You can have that. - Well... - It's not rotten. How do I know that? You gotta trust me. Thanks, man. - Have a good night. - You too. I don't know if I know how to fix anything, but I'll help you. I'm sure we could get one of the construction workers to help us. Oh, that's a good idea. Hey, what you got? It got hit by lightning. Wow, God firebombs his own house. Yeah, and he hit people who can't afford to fix it either. Insurance won't pay. Go figure. So, we're gonna fix it for 'em, right? Don't you have better things to be doing with your time? Like saving a six-year-old's life? This is the six-year-old's cross. Macey, do I need to take you off Alex Thomas? There is nothing wrong with us helping patients outside of the hospital. I wish that I had the time to do that too, but I have this little thing called a job. If you want to help your patients, do it by being a doctor. - Robin? - Yes. Didn't you do some work in Haiti, like a while ago? Yeah, I went for two weeks with Convoy of Hope. Yeah, okay. All right. I get it. But just cut back on all the God talk. There's no place for that kind of nonsense in the hospital. Why do you gotta call it nonsense? Just the whole idea of... Of blind faith. Terminal patients have a higher rate of recovery if they believe in a higher power. And correlation does not imply causation, Dr. Lewis. But why is believing in something so harmful? Like, why do you feel that way? Because belief in a god tricks us into thinking that somebody else is in charge, that they're gonna take care of us, that we don't need to take care of ourselves. You know what? I'll tell you something else. If there is a god, then he's a bully. He's a bully who takes kids and he gives them cancer, or drowns them, or lets them burn up. Look, God is this pretend idea that people embrace because it gives them hope that there's justice in the world. So keep him out of my hospital. Mmm-hmm, come in. I'd like to help. With what? This. - Oh, hi. Thank you. - Hi. I'm, uh, Dr. Macey Lewis. - I'm Kenneth. - Please sit. - It's nice to meet you. - Nice to meet you. You're the first person to come by. Um... - Really? - Yeah. So far, it's me and Nurse Kaitlyn. Uh, I'm sure that'll be enough. - Really? - Mmm-hmm. You're a godsend. I'll let you get back to work. Nice to meet you. - Nice to meet you too. - I'll see you there. Mmm-hmm. Today's a big day. You're gonna start taking the medicine that's gonna get you better. - Nurse Kaitlyn. - Yes? Did the Peter Parker serum come in? Do you mean the Spidey serum? Oh, yeah, it looks like somebody is gonna get superhero serum today, if that's okay with everybody here. It's okay with me. Now, Alex... You may get some Spidey senses as a side effect from the serum. Are you okay with that? Good, because it'll make you strong. Look at those guns. Where have you been hiding those? It's huge. You ready? Thanks. - Her white blood cell count's kind of low. - Mmm-hmm. Here's Alex Thomas's file. His chemo's going well. So far, all green. That's excellent. Kaitlyn and I are going to Alex's church on Sunday to help them fix their cross. I'm gonna let you have this one, Macey, but from here on out, let all patients be patients, okay? Alex, please stop that. And, Charlie, no more until Alex gets better, okay? Uh, is Shirley at bingo? Either that or she's interviewing my replacement. Um, I have to step out for a little bit. Make sure they don't play too rough. Yeah, of course. Children, who would like to study Braille? I tried. If I haven't said it lately, thank you. What for? Hmm? You and Shirley didn't have to take us in. It's all right, sugar. A pleasure. See you soon. Oh, thank you very much. - Hey. - Hey. - Look nice. - Thank you. So, how are you? Actually, that's what I wanted... Want something to drink? - Oh, hi. - Hey. I'll have another beer. You got it, handsome. You? - Just a Coke, thanks. - Sure thing. So, how are you? Uh, been better. They closed the assembly line, so... How are you? How's... How's your son? Alex. Bet he's growing like a weed. - There you go. - Thanks. - Get you folks something to eat? - I'm good. No, thanks. If you think of anything, just holler. Sorry. You were saying? Alex has cancer. Uh, I just found out. Wow. Yeah. So, w... What's gonna happen? Honestly, I don't know. He's about to start chemotherapy, so. I'll bet that's... That's tough. Sorry. We never really got a chance to talk about what happened between you and me. No, Brooke, I'm... I'm sorry. Uh, I was drunk, you were drunk. But I should've called. No, you don't... That's not what I meant. I need your help. Of course. What is it? If chemo doesn't work, then we're gonna start looking for a bone marrow donor. - And I'm not a match. - Okay. But his father might be. I don't want any money from you, I promise, and he wouldn't even need to know. I've had a son this whole time, and you never told me? Ian, I'm sorry. I wanted to tell you, I did, but by the time I found out, you were already dating Laura, and I didn't know... I was scared. I'm sorry, okay? I'm sorry. I'm here today to talk to you about being thankful for the things that you find it hard to be thankful for. At 25 years old, I lost my eyesight, which meant that I could not see my wife's beautiful face or look at my son. Yet, I am thankful. Yet, I am very thankful, because God saw fit for me to have life and to be able to speak to you. That's the guy who volunteered to help with the cross. - What? - Nothing. Today, I am thankful to hear my wife's beautiful voice. And I get a little tug on my shoulders when my son tugs me the best way he knows, when he says, "I love you." So I'm thankful for that. So, today I'm asking you when you go home, I don't want you to think about the things that God took away from you, but be thankful for the things that you do have. Now repeat after me. I am thankful for the things that I do have. I am thankful for the things that I do have. - Let the church say amen. Amen, y'all. - Amen. All right, amen. Let's all be thankful now. - Amen. - Amen. Oh, you have a gift. Whoa, thank you, but, uh, so do you. If you're half as good as I hear you are, then Alex will be cured in no time. - She's even better. - Yeah? Dr. Lewis. Uh, Kenneth... Pastor, this is Kenneth. He volunteered to help fix the cross. - Oh. - Beautiful sermon this morning, Pastor. - Thank you, thank you very much. - Beautiful. And you're Charlie, right? So nice to meet you. I'm gonna take a look at this cross, see what we're dealing with. - Let me know what you need. - Doc. Alex is a very brave kid. Oh, yeah, he is. Oh, yeah. I'm gonna do my absolute best. I know you will. I know you will. Hi. I don't think I've ever seen you outside of the hospital. Well, I've, um, found some free time. Looks like I missed the sermon though, huh? Yes, but you can make it up by going to the hardware store and buying us some white paint. What, no purple? You sure you don't wanna shake things up? And... And you are? Oh, I'm sorry, Dr. Zach Norman. Oh. Dr. Zach Norman. Well, white, red, purple, whatever. Well, in that case, purple it is. You got me. Um, I'll be back in a few with white paint. - Thank you. - Yeah. I'm hungry. Are you hungry? Yes. We're making sandwiches for everybody. Wanna come inside and help me? Yes, if you show me. So, I heard Alex is not feeling well. Yeah, he's in treatment. He's got leukemia. But he's the one that told Dr. Lewis about this cross. "Only believe, and he will be made well." Luke. That's right. Yeah, Luke, uh, 8:50. But one misquote. "Only believe and she will be made well." You know, I think you're right about that. I love that verse. How long have you been, uh, a man of God? - Forever. - Huh? We're all children of God, aren't we? There's one passage that's always meant a lot to me. - Which one? - Chapter seven, verse 16. - What's the scripture? - Recite it. For another time. You guys ready to do this? What would you like for me and Charlie to do? I think I just need you to step back. Charlie, can you get your dad over there for me? Little more. You should be good there. You ready? Ready for what? Ow! What's happening? What was that? Kenneth? What just happened? Doc, let me ask you something. All of the patients that you see, and the lives that you save, do they all need to understand the details of how you do that? The medicine and the needles? Or is it enough that they just trust that you know how to do it? You hooked the two ends to your truck, right? You winched them together. Something like that, yes. That wouldn't work, would it? So, come on. What's the secret? It's a trade secret. I can't tell you. Whoa, mm, that food is beginning to smell good. So shall we say grace? Heavenly Father, we are truly grateful for the food we're about to receive, to nourish and strengthen our bodies. - Amen. - Amen. - Amen. - Amen. Dig in. Hey, I know Pastor Jim already said it, but I really can't thank you enough for organizing this. It means a lot to Alex. Please, please. Have you talked to Alex's dad? Yeah, I did. How'd it go? Uh, not great. He kind of freaked out. And it had been so long, I didn't really know what to say. Mmm. Well, you're doing everything you're supposed to. And just let me know if I can help. Okay. Kaitlyn, hey, long time no see. So are you gonna introduce me to your new friends? - Why not? - Why don't you back off, buddy? Oh, is this your new boyfriend? It's funny. Last night you were at a bar with a different guy, and tonight, you're at this bar with this guy, this punk. You should leave. Should I? Yeah, you should. All right, knock it off, Shempner. Oh, come on. We were just having a friendly conversation. You got about ten seconds to get out of here before I start swinging. I think she means it, friend. Oh. All right, all right. No harm, no foul. Ooh, testy. Bye, beautiful. Come on, guys. Let's go. Left door, left door. Oh, that door doesn't open. I'm sorry. I'm so sorry. That was so embarrassing. Hey, hey... Why didn't you jump in back there? What good would that have done? We could've taught that guy a lesson. Lessons aren't taught with fists, Zach. Oh, here we go. Gonna tell me to turn the other cheek? All that garbage? You ever tried just counting to ten? I'm sorry I took so long. Just an idiot. Hi, Alex. Hi. My name's Ian. That's a funny name. I think so too. It's all right. You can call me Dad. Shirley, do you ever think we might have it all wrong? What do you mean? I've just been thinking about all the things that have happened to us. My parents, um, Jim's eyesight, Charlie. You know, Charlie's never spoken a word. And now, everything with Alex. Honestly, it feels like too much. Sometimes, I wonder if anyone's even listening. I know that Pastor Jim says we should be thankful, and I am, but sometimes... I wish God would cut us a break. A break. I know what you mean, but God doesn't have to prove anything to us. - He's God. - Hmm. We aren't. Just stay focused on trusting in him and being the wonderful mother you are, and things will work out. Yeah. You know that photo? Um, we took it probably a month after we made that necklace. My mom and I, we designed it together. We built it out of macaroni and dental floss. We'd take turns wearing it. She'd wear it one day, and I would next. But this one time, I wore it on the playground and the little heart right there popped off. I couldn't find it anywhere. I had the whole class helping me look for it for maybe 20 minutes. Even after I had it back in my hand, I was so upset that my mom had to come pick me up and take me home. She said that the reason it fell off was that we loved each other so much and the heart couldn't hold it. Sounds like somebody really loved her mother. Yeah. Yeah, she, uh... She was everything. That stupid thing probably cost like 20 cents to make. Mom? I know I at least have 20 cents in my piggy bank. I can buy another necklace. Would that make you happy? Oh, you, um... You don't... You don't have to do that, sweetie. That necklace, it was special because Grandma and I made it together. Besides, you already make me the happiest girl in the world. He's really worried about his hair. He wants to impress Ian. How are you holding up? Pastor Jim says to only believe, and God will help Alex. Listen, we're about to get a lot more aggressive. How? Ian's a match. I want to admit him, keep up with his chemo, and prep him for the transplant. For now, you can take him home, let him rest, have him see Charlie. We'll check him in on Friday. Okay. - Macey, thank you. - Oh! This is a good step. Charlie? Son? Shirley! All right. The Lord is my shepherd And I, I Shall not want Green pastures Ah. He leadeth me in the righteousness Ah! He restoreth my soul Yea, though I walk through the valley Oh! There's another passage that means a lot to me. - Which one? - Chapter seven, verse 16. Recite it. For another time. Well, I have to say that everything looks normal. It's a miracle. It's a bona fide miracle. I don't mean to insult you, Pastor, and I'm not an ophthalmologist, but the trauma that happened to your head, that could've broken free plaque that's been building up behind the ocular nerve. It could've, um, pushed the nerves together, much like hot-wiring a car. Mmm-hmm, and how often does that happen? Well... No, never, as far as I know, - but again, I'm not an ophthalmologist. - Mmm-hmm. So you're saying that, uh, something scientific happened that never happened before? Or is God's hand healing us the way he's done for all of my children? All I'm saying, Pastor, is that these things that happen, they're not magic. There's a scientific reason for how our brains work. Just like there's an explanation for that cross out there. Oh, you can come visit that cross out there anytime you want to. And I have, actually, a couple of times since that happened. And I haven't figured it out yet, but I'm sure that there is an explanation for how that construction worker got it fixed so well so fast. Yes, because it is a miracle. And I've already told you... And I already told you. It's a miracle. Doesn't it feel good to have somebody look out for you? Hey, Doc... Wanna tell me something? Uh, no. No, I'm good. Okay. Uh-oh, it's Shirley. What, you haven't told her yet? Didn't pick up the phone, and don't wanna leave it on her voice mail. Oh! How do I look? You... You look great, but you do know that she's seen you before, right? Oh, yeah. Dr. Norman, to what do we owe the pleasure? I just came to talk to the pastor here about miracles. Always a good thing. James, what's wrong? You're just as beautiful as the first time we met. Why would you say such a thing to me today? Doc. How many fingers am I holding up? Ja... No, James, James. James, James, James, James, James. Look at you. I spent a very long time in the hospital, and I didn't think I'd ever wanna come back here, but I just had to get in contact with you. About what, Mrs. Springstead? My recovery. I heard about it. It... It was out of the ordinary. It was a miracle. Yeah, I guess you could call it that. Only believe. A man came to me in my dreams and said, "Only believe." And then I woke up. That's the day we helped fix their cross. Mmm-hmm. There he is. There who is? The man in my dream. I'm telling you, something's up with that guy. I couldn't agree with you more. Ever since he's been around, strange things have been happening. I get it, but we have more important things to be focusing on. You're right. Glad to see you back. Go away, Tim. Come on. Look, I got scared. Made me nervous, and I overreacted. And I'm sorry. You really embarrassed me. You humiliated me in front of, one, my boss, - and people that I really care about. - Look, people that don't matter, because I'm the one who cares about you. Come play pool with us. I'll let you be on my team. - One, one game. - I don't like pool. You love pool. You love it. Let's go. - One game, though. - One game, I promise. Come on, one game. Let's go. Grab your drink. You missed Alex Thomas's appointment. Sorry. That's it? What's wrong? No, I'm sorry. It's not gonna happen again. Kaitlyn, you can tell me. It's really not that important. Well, in five years, I've never seen you miss a beat. We're admitting him on Friday. He needs you. Okay. Do you mind if I sit? Sure. How you holding up? I'm fine. Everything's fine. Doctor-patient confidentiality and all that. I get it, but I won't tell anyone. I'm worried about our friend. Yeah, I been thinking about him a lot too. He's not responding to the treatments the way he should. And I'm afraid I'm gonna break his mother's heart. But I'm not gonna let that happen. I know you'll do your best. Yeah, I'm gonna do my absolute best. I'm here to make my patients well. I should go back to work. Okay. See you soon. Dr. Norman? Kenneth, what are you doing here? I suppose I could ask you the same question. How did you fix that cross? Who are you? I'm just here to help, Zach. Who are you looking for, Zach? I'm looking for my sister. You talk to her a lot? No, not lately. She, uh... She died when we were kids. She was... It was my fault. She fell through the ice she was skating on. I promised her that the ice wasn't too thin, but it was. And I couldn't save her. - You were just a kid. - And it was my fault. I'm sure it wasn't your fault. We don't always get to understand the reason. What reason does God or the universe have for drowning a ten-year-old little girl? You work with kids now, right? Yeah. You save their lives, - prolong their lives. - And this is a fair trade? That's what you're saying? My sister's life for my patients'? - Would you do it? - Who gets to decide that? Would you have done that if it weren't for her? Amy's okay, Zach. She's okay. I didn't tell you her name. Listen to me. Hey. Listen to me. Your sister is okay. In fact, she's more alive now than ever. I know that's hard to believe. Kind of like if you saw a cross get fixed in an instant. Or heard about a blind pastor getting his sight back. Right? I'll see you at the hospital, Dr. Norman. Hey, um... I know it's been a while since I've been here... After we, uh, buzz this off, we're gonna shave it. Anyone ever taught you to shave? No? You're six years old and no one's taught you to shave? That's crazy. You're basically a man. All right, so here's what you do. Okay. Come here, and then a little goop. Just ploppity-plop. Go ahead. You can use both hands. It's fine. Yep, good, cover it. Oh, oh, oh, oh. Good, now rinse your hand. Grab the razor, and we're gonna do this together. Ready? And down. There you go. Now rinse it, right there in the pool. Good, keep going. You're a pro. My uncle taught me right around your age. Gonna clean all this off here. Oh! You did a good job. Ready for yours? No? Hey... I got an idea. - Okay, ready? - Mm-hmm. One, two, three, open. He did it. I love it. You're not hungry, baby? How about you take a bite? Well, well, well. If it isn't the holier-than-thou table. Kumbaya. Uh-uh, that's what the guy looked like. Can you please leave us alone? Oh, I'm sorry. I... I didn't realize I was imposing. Well, you are. Excuse me? How 'bout you go? Okay, how 'bout I go? You gonna take me? You gonna take me somewhere? Let's go outside. Let's go out together. Come on, fuzzy. Let's go. Come on. You're not worth it. I'm worth it. Charlie, let him down. No! - Stop it, Charlie! - Charlie, let him down. Hey. We'll be all right, buddy. No. No, Charlie. I have to get some bone marrow before I go home for Christmas. Mom? Yeah, babe? If I don't get better and go to heaven, I'll ask Grandma where your macaroni necklace is. And I'll help you find it. Well, you don't have to worry about that, 'cause you're getting better right now. Let there be light. - Pastor Lindy. - Mmm-hmm. Good to see you. - Can we talk for a moment? - Sure. This may sound crazy, but I don't think it is, I don't think it's crazy at all. Dr. Norman, he can search for all the logical explanations he can find, but, uh, I think that you have caused miracles. You fixed an irreparable cross, and you restored my vision. I didn't do that. Take it back. Go ahead. Take it back. I want to exchange my vision so you can heal Alex. I'm very grateful for the gift you gave me, but take it back. In exchange, I want you to heal Alex. - James? - Yeah? How long have you been a man of God? All my life. Then you know it doesn't work like that. Yeah, but, uh, you have a direct connection. I'm sorry. You've preached many times about the mysterious ways of God and the mysterious ways of this world. You need to trust your own words. Only believe, and he will be made well. Alex, I know it hurts. But I am so proud of you. Now, you have your dad's stem cells and bone marrow to help you fight. Yeah, that's my man. You can close your eyes. I know you're tired. We'll be right here. It's all right. Thank you for this treatment. And thank you for Dr. Macey and for Ian. Please protect Alex and keep him safe. Amen. Things are really that bad, huh? Remember the night we met? I showed you the apple. You were right about the apple and the worm. It's just too late for me. It's like it's eating me on the inside. I just don't wanna feel like this anymore. There's an easier way. You just have to learn how to forgive, Kaitlyn. Why are you here? I'm here for you. You think that you're beyond saving because you always choose men... who treated you like your father did. You have to forgive your father, Kaitlyn. How do you know about my father? I just know. Well, if you just know, then you know why I cannot forgive him. But you can. If you let him, God can help you. But it's not fair. I mean, that is not fair. No, it's not fair. You're right. Forgiveness isn't fair. It's a gift. It's a gift? That man doesn't deserve a gift. We all deserve that gift. I know it's not easy. Trust me. But you have to try. Can you try? I can try. Good. I thought you could use that. I talked to Mary Springstead. She said that you came to her in a dream. Is that the truth, Kenneth? Why would God want to hurt a little boy? I can make him better. I can save him. Macey, you don't save lives. You can prolong them, and you're the best. There is no one better at that than you. But whether your patients live to be six or 100 it's nothing compared to eternity. It's not nothing to his mother. I'm here to make sure he sees 100. Yes, you are. That's why you're here. Oh, I'm so sorry I'm late, Alex. How are you feeling today? - My throat hurts. - It does? Well, let's get you some medicine to make you feel better. Doctor, could we have some water and medicine immediately? - Water, stat. - Thank you. Did my dad's bones work? Well, we're still waiting to hear, but what we do have is something very important, and that's hope. I'm scared. Well, it's okay to be scared. You know what I do when I'm scared? I think about my mother, my father, and my whole family who loves me. And then there's God. He loves us too. What's going on? He's having a seizure. - Brooke, Ian, please wait outside. - He's tachycardic. We need oxygen and suction. Come on, Alex. I need you to fight for me. Our Father, who art in heaven, hallowed be thy name. Thy kingdom come. Thy will be done. I believe. I believe that God has a plan for him and for me. - There he is. - Alex's stats are dropping. - Where are you taking him? - Alex? We'll pray for you. - What's going on? - He stopped breathing. Ms. Thomas, don't touch. Alex, Mom's here and Dad too. We love you so much, and everything's gonna be fine. I need you to wait right here. - You don't get scared. - I am. We have no control. We have to trust in the Lord. - James... - Mmm-hmm. I'm not other people. You can admit that you're afraid. No, my faith is at its highest. I have it on high authority that all we have to do is just believe, and he'll be made well. You've said that to me 100 times. - Yes. - Brooke, too. Mmm-hmm. Where? Where will he be made well, James? Where are all Christians made well? Lord, please protect my son, and bring him safely back to me. Amen. Alex, you are the strongest person I've ever met. You are so brave, and I am so proud to be your mother. Brooke... I want you to know that regardless of what happens with Alex... No, Ian. - Alex is gonna get better. - Just listen. I want you to know that I do not regret one moment you've given me with him. He gave me joy. I didn't think I could have that anymore. - Thank you. - Yeah. No matter what happens. I just... I just wanna hear his voice again, you know? I wanna hear him say, "Mommy." Brooke, can I talk to you for a moment? What's wrong with him? We've had him on relatively heavy IVs for his heart and blood pressure, but unfortunately, he's not responding the way I'd hoped. What does that mean? If his blood pressure stays low for too long... It could affect the oxygen going to his brain. Macey, is Alex... I am going to do everything I can. I'm gonna do my very best. So, why don't I have somebody bring you and Ian something to eat from the cafeteria, okay? Thank you. They're good people. No, they made a mistake. You need to run the test again. - Brooke, I'm so sorry. - I don't care that you're sorry. He just needs more time, okay? He's gonna get better. We could keep his body going for a long time. Well, then you keep his body going. What are suggesting that we do? Even if Alex somehow made it through this he would never be the same little boy that you knew. No, no, you're wrong. God is gonna make Alex better. I believed. No, no, no, no, no. No, no, no, no. Oh, I'm sorry. I'm truly sorry. So, does he know? Yes, we talked to him about it but it's gonna take a little while for him to understand. No, no, Charlie. No, baby. So, love Come find me Oh, love Come find me Ooh Oh, love Come find me... God... Thank you for the gift of Alex. Thank you for letting him into your kingdom. We ask you for the strength. Please help us find the words. You've brought us so far these last few months. Amen. I'm sorry. No. You don't get to be here. You're a liar and a fake. God made my baby very, very sick. And you told Pastor Jim that if I only believed, he would be made well. But that wasn't true. I believed. I really did, with everything I had. So you tell me why Alex wasn't made better like you said he would. You did believe. And your belief is beautiful. Alex is where all believers are made well. Alex is more alive than ever. He made you a promise. And we both wanted to make sure it was fulfilled. He did it. Alex found my mom in heaven. Somebody really loved his mother. Who are you? God is with you... And he always will be. No matter what. "For I am convinced that neither death nor life, "nor angels..." "Nor principalities, "nor powers, "nor things present, nor things to come, "nor height, nor depth, "nor any other creature, "shall be able to separate us from our love of God." As a pastor, I don't know how many times I've been asked where God is when bad things happen. The answer, whether you can see it or not, he's in the same place he's always been. With us. Happy birthday to you Make a wish. What do you think, should we tell them? Um, everyone, we think we know what Charlie wished for. What? You tell them. It's a boy. - Congratulations. - That's fantastic, you guys. We're so excited. Who is it? I said who is it? When my will gets weak And this yoke's too much to shoulder You know just what I need Though my mind can't even fathom When the ocean's deep And my lungs they take in water You're the breath I breathe Spirit, God Abba Father, I cry out In a language I can't understand But you hear a sound that satisfies You revive me, edify me Give me rest in you Let me rest in you You revive me, edify me Give me rest in you Let me rest in you When the ocean's deep And my lungs they take in water You're the breath I breathe You're the breath I breathe Spirit, God Abba Father, I cry out In a language I can't understand...
