[MUSIC PLAYING] NARRATOR: It has been several years since the comet collided with the Earth, creating a titanic dust cloud that blocked out the sun's precious light. As an unknown virus began to spread throughout the planet, the population receded. Governments struggled to maintain order, city streets turned into war zones, and desperation reigned. [PANICKED CHATTER] [GUNSHOTS] [BRAWLING] [WOOD SHATTERING] What do you want? You blood money sucker! THUG: But he won't be the one collecting it. Maybe you should step aside, amigo. Three against one doesn't seem fair to me. Fair for who? [GUNSHOTS] [ENGINE REVVING] Come on, you! Let's go! DESK SERGEANT: Roland Cheney? You have been round here since-- well, since that car crash. Terrible tragedy, that. Well last I heard, you were, um-- you don't remember me, do you? I used to play second base with your brother, but it was a long time ago. How is my brother? DESK SERGEANT: Oliver? I don't know. A couple of months ago he was picked up by the Emergency Council for some kind of medical research. CHRISTINE: Oliver! It's our old neighborhood! Oliver? Oliver, wake up! What? We just passed the deli. They used to make your favorite pastrami sandwiches, remember? Don't remind me. I wonder what happened to your parents' house. We used to have some good times there, huh? Mhm. I miss having a home, Oliver. Yeah, I know. Once we get to the safe zone, we can put all this behind us. We can rebuild our lives. Maybe even start a family. SHERIFF: In this neck of the woods, it's customary to pay a 10% service fee. For what? Good and friendly service. And if the service sucks? SHERIFF: [CHUCKLES] Then you write a letter of complaint. Make it to the management. And just who might that be? [CHUCKLES] You're looking at him. DEPUTY: Problem, Sheriff? You remember that bastard? He tried to burn the high school down? Well now he's got the biggest gang around. He's running his base out of the old Spanish mission. That son of the bitch has the local monopoly on gasoline. Nothing's changed. You don't want to go after him, Roland. The last three guys who tried that, they ended up with lead in their heads. I'll keep that in mind. Hey prof, you got the time? It's 12 o'clock. CONVOY SOLDIER 1: Is that midday or midnight? VICTOR: Your guess is as good as mine. [EXPLOSIONS] [GUNFIRE] [PANICKING] [GUNFIRE] We've got to get out of here! [GUNSHOTS] [GRUNTING] T-BONE: Nothing here worth shit, Little Ray. LITTLE RAY: I have eyes, I can see. Come on. CONVOY SOLDIER 2: [MOANING] Please help me. [GUNSHOT] [KNOCKING] Hello? Either you can open the door and live, or we will blow it and you will definitely die. Open the door! Hi. [GUNSHOTS] Yeah! You. Please don't shoot me! Please don't shoot me! Come here. You're going to shoot me, I know! [LAUGHS] How is this guy? He's pathetic! Can I kill him now, Little Ray? Empathy, T-Bone. OK? What's your name? What's your name? What's your name, goddammit! It's Victor! Victor. I know you're afraid. But if you stop your whining and you come over here right now, then I am-- I am not-- I'm not going to-- to kill you. [LAUGHS] I'm not, I promise. You have Little Ray's word. Come on, come on, Victor. Come on. We've got to get out of here, Christine. Come on, let's go. [WHIMPERING] Shhh. Please. Please. Now listen, I-- I would like to know a complete inventory of what you're carrying in there. Hey! Come back here! [GUNSHOT] [GUNSHOT] LITTLE RAY THUG 1: Aww. LITTLE RAY THUG 2: He's getting away! Come on, come on, come on! Christine! Oliver! [GUNFIRE] Christine, you're going to have to make a run for it. No! [GUNSHOTS] I'll keep them pinned down. And then I'll follow. I'm not leaving you! [GUNSHOTS] Come on! You got to go now! Please! Oliver! I love you. [GUNSHOT] [GUNSHOTS] You have to go now! I'll follow. You have to go! [GUNFIRE] [GUNSHOTS] [CLICKING] Well then. I thought you were dead. I'm not Roland. Fooled me. You're the wimpy twin, uh-- Oliver. Oliver! Hey. Whatever happened to Roland? After he killed Mom and Dad? Little Ray, you always were scum. I gotta hand it to you, Oliver. You put up a hell of a fight. You're thinking, I wish I had one more bullet so I could put it right between this bastard's eyes, right? Well I'm going to give you the chance. Remember that game we used to play with Roland when we were kids? With our paint guns and the paint balls? Well we're not little boys anymore. So now we play for real. [GUNSHOT] [GASPS] [CRUNCH] Can I kill him now, boss? There's a time for everything T-Bone. Victor, I want to know about this convoy. Because I don't see any food, I don't see any gas, I don't see any guns. It was the people. The people? The-- the civilians. What is so damn important about civilians? The Emergency Council's found a way to stop the plague. T-BONE: Don't talk shit. I'm not. You're lying. VICTOR: It's true! Six of them carried positive antibodies against the plague. We were going to use them to create a vaccine. A vaccine that would have-- would have put an end to this all. You're lying. T-Bone, I'm trying to have a conversation with this gentleman. Do you mind? Sorry. Are you telling me that I just killed the only six people that could have saved this godforsaken planet from the plague? Yeah. This conversation just ended. No, wait! The girl. The one that got away. She could be a carrier. How come you're not sure? I'm just a technician, but I could find out. They were all injected with tracking cells. There's a tracking system in the back of the truck. The generators down. All I need is some power and I could tell you for sure. Power? I've got plenty. Takes some man. Find the bitch. I want her alive. Alive, T-Bone. [CLUB MUSIC PLAYING] BARTENDER: Drink? No thanks. I need ammo. Take the stairs. First on your right. Ask for Wilbur. You better have some real money on you. Thanks. WILBUR: First I'd like to congratulate you on your style. Secondly, I'd like to make you an offer you can't refuse. It's not for sale. You sure about that? I just need ammo. I'd be lying to you if I said I wasn't disappointed. So what will it be? I've got soft-nose, copper jacket, dum-dum, original lead, armor piercing. Original lead. [CLUB MUSIC PLAYING] How you doing, mac? Now Duff, mate, we don't want no trouble in here. Whoever does? We're looking for a bitch. Blond hair, reddish pants, nice titties, clean-looking. Ain't no one clean in here. You don't mind if we take a look around, do you? Good. [SURPRISED CRIES] If there's anything else you need, and I'll mean anything, you just come talk to Wilbur. I'm your man. PROSTITUTE: Hey! Get out of here you little pervert! I'm sorry! PROSTITUTE: --looking at? You didn't pay for this! Can you believe that moron? [CRYING IN PAIN] You! But you're dead! Well then. I guess you're just gonna have to die again. It's the wimp's brother! Get him! [GUNSHOT] [GUNSHOT] What do you mean I'm dead? Little Ray blew you away-- your brother, I mean. When and where? Half an hour ago. I said where? Down Fifth Avenue. Industrial area. Sucker's a bitch. You better get this right, Victor. Otherwise, I'm going to have to let T-Bone hurt you. A lot. [LAUGHS] I don't see anything. You told me there were six carriers. Where are they? The carriers are dead, then the tracking cells won't work! Should I kill him now, boss? Wait! I've got a reading heading south, southwest. But-- But what? Well I don't understand. It's too small to be a person, but it's definitely an antibody gene carrier. And it's moving, look! Shhh. Shhh. The bitch is pregnant. T-Bone, the bitch is pregnant. Christine Chaney? It don't say nothing here about her being pregnant. That's because she doesn't know. I do. [QUIET SOBBING] [CRYING] Roland. What's your name? Christine. I didn't know Oliver was married. And you're hurting me. I'm sorry. Give me that gun back. What do you want it for? Oliver is dead. Yeah, I know. I just buried him. I'm going to kill the men who did it. ROLAND: No you're not. CHRISTINE: Let me go. Listen to me, Christine. Nothing can-- No, just leave me alone. Don't you touch me! LITTLE RAY THUG 3: Get the girl! [CRASHING] Where are we going? To the safe zone. Fasten your seat belt. [ENGINE REVVING] Something's happening. I think I've got her. LITTLE RAY: Then how come the light's moving away from us? You idiot. Maybe she's found herself a car. Someone's giving her a ride. Little Ray? Jake here's got something to tell you. I'm listening. Boss, we went to the saloon like you said. And what? They bumped into Roland Chaney. Roland Chaney? It is a small world, isn't it? I bet he's giving her a ride. Apparently, he's a bounty hunter. A damn good one. He killed Duff, Garrett, and Cleon. Jake here reckons he's a real mean son of a bitch. Jake. How come [LAUGHS] he didn't kill you? Is it because you're a scared little bunny rabbit? You want me to kill him, Little Ray? No. I'll give him one more chance. If you don't come back with her alive, you don't come back. So, those guys back at the house, they thought you a gene carrier? It was Oliver, not me. A few months ago, a research virologist discovered a peculiar gene that was immune to the virus. It was based on experimental blood tests done 15 years ago. 15 years is a long time and people die. By the time they finished tracking down all the people who had the antibody, they found only six. Six carriers. Oliver was one of them. Now there's no hope. No sun. No life. They're already dead, they just don't know it yet. Soon we'll be just like them. So Roland, what have you been up to the past six years? Nothing much. Just trying to survive like everybody else. You classify being a bounty killer as nothing much? We heard rumors about what you were doing. Look, I want you to kill Little Ray for me. I'll double the bounty. This is all the money that we saved. We were going to buy some land. I was going to try my hand at mushroom farming. They don't need much sunlight. What do you take me for? He was my brother for Christ's sake! I don't want your money. What do you want, my sympathy? You were no brother to Oliver. And you certainly were no son to your parents. CHRISTINE: [YELPS] [BOOM] [EXPLOSION] [TIRES SCREECHING] Here, you wanted to use this? Use it! [GUNSHOTS] Hold on! [SCREAMS] [BOOM] CHRISTINE: [SCREAMS] [CRASHING] JAKE: Aw, lose something? [CHUCKLES] [ENGINE REVVING] [TIRES SQUEALING] [EXPLOSION] Why are those guys after you, Christine? It's not me they're after, it's you! Bullshit! There's something you're not telling me! [EXPLOSION] Damn. I knew I should have never fallen in love with that machine. What is wrong with you? We were almost killed! And all you care about is your stupid car that you're so in love with? You know, it is just really too bad that you don't know anything about real love, and you are such an asshole. Christine. Why do you hate me so much? Why? All right, I'll tell you why. I hate you because you killed your parents and you left Oliver to bury them. You were drunk when you hit that truck. I hate you because you weren't there for Oliver when he really needed you. But more than anything, I hate you because every time I look at you-- I see him. Do you know why I came back? No, I don't. Why don't you tell me. To make things right with Oliver. Well, you were a little late, weren't you? Lets go. Where to now? [SIGHS] Bar's closed, cowboy. I'm here on business. Don't tell me you've already used up all that ammo I gave you. No, not yet. Fact is, I was wondering if you knew of any buggies for sale. As a matter of fact, I do. There's a V8 supercharged desert [INAUDIBLE].. Independent suspension, ABS brake system, long distance gas tanks, navigation computer. How much? Machines like that are scarce. I said how much? Look, the guy's asking for 20. But I'm sure I can bring him down to 17 on account I like your style. I've got 12. I'm afraid we've got a little problem. I'll make up the difference. WILBUR: Put that away. But when you do business with Wilbur, it's cash on delivery, that's the deal. This might take some time. How long? Three, four hours. The seller lives out by the old refinery. We'll wait. Roland, I really need to get some sleep, I'm exhausted. No problem. I've got a spare room upstairs you can use. I'll even send up some water so you can wash free of charge. Thanks I appreciate that. Thank you. Roland. What? About the things I said to you. I didn't mean to be so harsh. Yeah, well you sure know how to dig a knife in. I'm sorry. Look, I know you meant what you said, but I don't blame you. Go ahead, use my water. You don't need it? No, I'm fine. Thanks. Do what you gotta do. You have a beautiful back. Thank you. I'm sorry. I shouldn't have said that. It's all right. It's just that I haven't seen a woman like that in a long time. I guess you're right. I don't know anything about love. It's something you can learn to do again. It's never too late. Seems like I've always been too late. That time in the car with my parents, I saw the truck too late. Now with Oliver, the same thing. Seems like I'm always too late. What's happening? Enlighten me. Well, they've been holed up in the same spot for the past half hour. Oh really? Where? T-BONE: Looks like they could be at Wilbur's place. Then what the hell am I doing here? Good night, Roland. I have a feeling it's day, not night. Whatever. [CRUNCHING] You blow this for me, I'll kill you. WILBUR THUG: Sorry. - Christine! - What? Wake up, let's go. Why? Looks like Wilbur changed his mind about the deal. Follow me. How ya doing, Roland? A long time. [WOOD SLAMMING] They're gone! WILBUR: Goddammit! Hi, Wilbur. Little Ray. What are you doing here? I'm here for the bitch. Where is she? I don't know. She's gone. Swear to God. I wouldn't lie to you, Little Ray, you know that. Well, just to be absolutely sure. [GUNSHOTS] [SCREAMS] [GUNSHOT] [PANICKED SHRIEKING] I apologize for any inconvenience, ladies. Please go back to your rooms. Where is she? According to the tracking system, she's still in the saloon. Did you copy that, Little Ray? Yeah, I heard. Find the bitch. [SCREAMS] She's gone. Bring Cheney in. Thank you Roland. I know she's here, I just don't know where. Where is she? What do you want her for? [GRUNTING] I'll be asking the questions. Where is she? Go to hell. Once an asshole, always an asshole, huh, Little Ray? That felt good. LITTLE RAY (OVER RADIO): What do you mean she's in the saloon? Huh? The tracking device is accurate up to a radius of a hundred yards. Did you copy that, Ray? Jimmy, Bozo, watch this son of a bitch. [GUNSHOTS] Damn. We're out of gas. What do we do now? We walk. You OK? Yeah, I'm fine. Come on. What is it? Scavengers. - Ignore them. Just keep walking. What do they want? Just keep walking. Whatever you do, don't let them see that you're afraid. How you folks doing? PATRIARCH: Stop! What are you doing here? We journey to the safe zone, elder. And why do you choose this path? It's been many years since I've been to this city. I've lost touch with his ways. I apologize for transgressing your boundaries. They have guns. We need them. I know this wanderer. He is not part of the man they call Little Ray. He means us no harm. You shall have safe passage. Thank you, elder. I did not say the woman would have safe passage. We have many sick here. The woman will help heal. This woman is part of me. She goes where I go. In spite of the fact that I gave you another life? I would rather die than be separated from this woman. You're either a madman or a very brave man. Sometimes I think I'm both. They shall both have safe passage. May the plague never visit you and your kind. Thank you. Tell me something. If you've been away for so long, how come he knows you? In the early years after the comet struck, scavengers didn't live in camps. They moved from the city to city depending on the weather. So you met him somewhere? Yeah. Somewhere. Little Ray? This is T-Bone. They've changed course, now headed north, northeast. Somewhere near the scavengers camp. Good work, T-Bone. [ENGINE REVVING] SOLDER: Freeze! Hold it! Nice hardware. Scanner. Positive, captain. Chopper's on its way. Wait-- wait a minute, what's going on here? After the ambush, we lost sight of the carriers on our system. We were about to abort the mission when we located a tiny, almost indistinct trace on our tracking system. I don't understand. It-- it was my husband Oliver who had the gene. Are you telling me I'm pregnant? Congratulations, Christine. I guess that explains Little Ray. [ROTOR BLADES WHIRLING] So I guess I'm going to be an uncle. Take care of yourself, Christine. Roland! You're coming with me. This is something I've got to do. No, no you don't. Not anymore. Christine. I may not know if it's night or day, but I know that I've got to bring Little Ray down. I can't be too late this time. You understand? Please, get on that chopper. CAPTAIN: Let's go, move out! SOLDER: All secure, captain. Good luck. Little Ray? Something weird's going on. She's moving fast now. And it's straight towards the safe zone. It's like she's-- she's in the air! She's in a chopper or something! [ROTOR BLADES WHIRLING] LITTLE RAY: Yeah, I see it. Aim for the tail, take out the rotor blades. [GUNFIRE] [EXPLOSION] [ALARMS BLARING] We're hit! We're going down! Mayday, Mayday, Mayday! CAPTAIN (OVER RADIO): --transport copter's hit! Going down! Mayday! Go! Bitch. [ALARMS BLARING] [GUNFIRE] Hi, Christine. I'm Little Ray. I bet you've been dying to meet me. After you, my precious. Victor! What are you doing here? Uh, I work for Little Ray now. Well done, Little Ray. I knew you'd do it. We make a hell of a team, huh? Team? Well yeah, sure. I mean, you'd never have found her if it wasn't for me. Can I kill him now, Little Ray? No. I'll do it myself. [GUNSHOT] [ENGINE REVVING] Ah, wanderer. What brings you back to this place of no hope? I believe we share a common need, elder. The light of the warrior shines brightly in your eyes. I pity the man that crosses your path. That man's name is Little Ray. Listen, bitch, I don't want you to worry about the blood, I'll have someone come clean it up. You know, it's actually kind of refreshing having a woman about the place. And you're not a bad looker either. [EXPLOSION] [GUNFIRE] [EXPLOSIONS] We're under attack, Little Ray! Who is it? The feds? I don't know! [EXPLOSIONS] [ENGINE REVVING] [GUNFIRE] [EXPLOSIONS] Watch the bitch. [EXPLOSIONS] [GUNFIRE] [GUNSHOTS] [GUNSHOTS] [GUNFIRE] [GUNSHOTS] [GUNFIRE] [GUNSHOTS] [GUNSHOT] [GUNSHOT] [GUNSHOT] [GUNFIRE] You know, I gotta tell you, that one brother of yours, you should have seen the look on his face when I popped him. Yeah, well, I can't wait to see the look on your face when I pop you, Little Ray. [GUNFIRE] LITTLE RAY: Roland! What? LITTLE RAY: I, uh, don't hear you reloading. That's funny. I don't hear you reloading either. LITTLE RAY: [LAUGHS] Interesting. Listen, uh, what do you say we finish this off like men? Sounds good to me. Sounds to me that Little Ray is giving someone something to think about. [EXPLOSIONS] Now we wait. [CHUCKLES] [SCREAMS] I had a girlfriend friend like you once. She had a bigger nose. Not that I don't like your nose. I do. Fact is, I got a thing for noses, you know? Don't ask me why. You hear that? What? It's too damn quiet. Come here. If you so much as squeak, and I'll blow out your brains, you hear me? [DOOR CREAKING] [GUNSHOTS] [SCREAMS] [GRUNTS] Are you OK? Yeah, I'm fine. Come on, let's get out of here. LITTLE RAY: Where the hell do you think you're going? What are you waiting for, Roland? Why don't you shoot me between the eyes? Just like I did to your brother? Now don't get sentimental on me just because I don't have a gun. You remember that game we used to play when we were kids, Little Ray? Let's play it again now. For the last time. LITTLE RAY: [CHUCKLES] Well you know me. That's my all-time favorite game. [HEAVY CRASHING] [GUNSHOT] [GUNSHOT] [THEME MUSIC]
