. (Gate clanking) (tense music) (tense, gentle music) (countdown beeping) - [Vincent] Sit down. Where's my daughter? - I don't know. She was blackmailed. (Tense music) - Blackmail? What the fuck are you talking about? (Clock ticking) - I can't remember everything. I woke up, I must've been drugged. Somebody put something (Angela gasps) in my drink. I woke up on my lawn, and I couldn't remember anything, except for one crazy image of Angela, dead. (Angela gasps) (water splashes) She was dead. (Clock ticking) - You want me to sit here and listen to your fucking dreams? - No. - [Vincent] Sit down! (Heart beating) - Sometimes two memories are blended in one. (Slow paced music) And I can't even remember where it happened. - [Angela] Hey, you work across the street, right? Yeah, I come to your open mike night. - [Jake] I bartend poetry night. - I thought you looked familiar. - Do you perform, or? - Oh no, no. I mean, not yet. I mean, I'm like behind the scenes. I uh, I promote events. - In here? - No. (Angela chuckles) No, not in here. Actually, yeah, you should check it out. Maybe I'll see you there. - [Jake] Oh, so this is a rave, I've never been to one. - [Vincent] Sit down! (Rushing winds) - It was just a dream. It was a dream but it felt like it was real, it was... It was a dream. It was a dream. Oh my God it was a dream. It was a dream but it felt like it was real. (Fast music beating) - [Angela] You want some? (Jake sniffing) - [Security] Put your hands up! (Slow paced music) - I said at times it gets dark, but there's always the rising sun. Indulge in self-love because there's always the rising sun. I'm queen to my kingdom. (Crowd cheers and snaps) - All right guys, I hope you guys had a good night. I hope you enjoyed everything, you guys have a great night. - You guys, if you could sit down for a moment please. Everybody. Thank you. Thank you. You might recognize me, I'm usually on that side of the bar. Never been up here on the stage. Your eyes, a painting in my mind. Is as close as I can come with you. Your figure pressed against my chest as night and dawn wept through. Your kiss so perfect from the rest. It's a taste of love, arrested in the loo. (Crowd cheering and snapping) I don't know, I can't remember anything else. (Jake grunting) - [Vincent] Where's my daughter? - Mr. Rose, I've been looking for Angela. I went to the cops to report her missing. - [Goon] No cops! (Jake grunts) (bell rings) - [Angela] How'd you get us off the hook with the cops? (Jake chuckles) - My Mom's ex is a cop. - So he must know my Dad. - Oh yeah? Why is that? What do you mean? - What do you mean? You didn't tell me you were a poet. - I'm not a poet. - You sounded like one. - Now you're teasing me. - You ever romanticize us getting busted for coke? (Both laughing) That's pretty cool! - Thanks. I wanna write screenplays, so-- - You're a screenwriter? - [Jake] Yeah, that's what I wanna do. - Well, you should write me something. - You're an actress. - I'm an actress. - My Mom was a manager. - Talent manager? Does she rep anybody I know? - Well she repped Angie Malone. - Angie Malone? - Angie Malone? The star who drowned herself in New Orleans. - I'm named after her. - That's crazy. - What are the odds of that? - I don't know. - Your Mom is not that crazy manager that like faked Angie Malone's death, right? - I mean she was a little crazy, but no, no, no, no, no she, no she wasn't, her death wasn't faked. - That was some weird rumors. - It's it's, it's that, people can be mean. - Yeah. - But you, I'm sorry. Go ahead. - No, go ahead. - [Jake] No, sorry, you go ahead. - No, I was just thinking like, this is really cool. - Huh? - You have this like really good opportunity to like make something big. Like Angie Malone's life story. Your Mom was her manager. - You know, I was thinking about that a long time ago, but-- - Really? - It was a little overwhelming 'cause 'Cause I wanted to do it right. You know what I mean? And everything I've written before I never, I never finished. But if I did it, you would have to play Angie Malone. Would you do it? What? - If I wrote the best - character of all time-- - [Angela] Stop! - I would, I'd play Angie Malone, are you kidding me? (Angela gasping) (water splashing) - See, the thing is Jake-- - Vin is a good friend of mine. - We owe Vincent. - He's a good PI. - A fucking good PI to the family. You're gonna fucking tell us where Angela is. - [Angela] These are memories that nobody has access to. - Just stupid bedtime stories that my Mom told me. - That people don't know. - See, the problem is that no one cares about an actress that becomes famous. That's not enough of a story. - That's not what the story is about Jake. It's about a woman who falls in love with her soulmate. And she has to try to overcome all these obstacles that keep getting in her way. You know, there's a lot that happens. She punches a cop in the face. Shaved her head. She donated a million dollars to charity. People wanna know these stories Jake. Look! Got you a fortune. - Ah. Okay. - Never give up on your dreams. - Is it really what it says? - Yeah! You just have to believe in yourself, okay? - [Jake] Would you give a million dollars to charity? - What the fuck, she gave a million dollars to charity? - I wish had a million dollars to just give away to charity. - Would you? - Yeah, why not? - She gives a million dollars to the homeless and then she winds up homeless! - My Mom found her on the street. She gave her the role of a lifetime. "The Bach Double." I love that movie. My Mom always made me play that song. "The Bach Double." "The Bach Double." "The Bach Double." - Look at this. It says right here that by the age of 20, Angie Malone mastered the violin in that movie-- - "The Bach Double." - "The Bach Double," yes! - I love that movie. - Me too! But that means I'm gonna have to learn how to play the violin. - I can teach you. - Wait, you know how to play the violin? - I do. The Angel taught me when I was really little. - [Angela] The Angel? - Yeah. (Both chuckle) I didn't know her name. - Oh, okay. - So we called her the Angel. - [Jake] I can teach you what I learned. This is the bow. - Okay. - You wanna hold the bow right there with your fingertips. Okay. So we're gonna play the first note. A little vibrato, please.

I have a meeting with Walt Warshaw. - Walt Warshaw? - I mean, he may wanna direct it, I don't know. - No way! - So, your ring - Oh my gosh! - [Jake] may get bigger. - I don't need a bigger ring. But Walt Warshaw, oh my God! (Light rock music) - I started off out in England. You know, I was acting, I was doing theater and I was doing a production of Macbeth. My girlfriend was actually playing Lady Macbeth. The play is notorious for being kind of unlucky. You know, one night after the show we're back at the pub and this guy who's playing young Seward, he's coming on to my girlfriend. He's like you know touching her up and stuff so I hit him. And unfortunately I hit him in the bottom of the nose, and it sent the bone up into his brain, and he died. It was like life imitating art, and you know it became a very big story, because that's exactly what happens in the play. They had Macbeth on trial and they wanted to take him down. They really lost perspective, and I ended up getting a six year sentence for manslaughter. But you know the bottom line is I got out of England, I started dealing drugs a little bit, and I wanted to get back into the business, but nobody was interested. And I made a lot of money in Miami dealing, and I moved to Hollywood to make some movies. And I made a fucking incredible, fucking movie, it was a masterpiece. Unfortunately, reporters figured out who I was and my whole story, and I just derailed my whole career for the last 15 years. - Hi, this is Jake Hart for Walt Warshaw, oh. - I'm gonna need to pat you down. - Fantastic situations, and the people that are coming into my life, and make great movies. - [Security] I'm gonna need you to sign in here. - I'm Jake Hart and I'm here to see Mr. Warshaw. - All right. Hi Mr. Warshaw's appointment's here. Okay. His assistant says he doesn't have an appointment. - It's five o'clock, can you please check again? - Hold on. Yes. Okay. He does not. - Okay, you gotta go. - Stop, stop! Are you Jake? - Yes, I'm Jake Hart. - Jake, what time is it? - It's 5:05. - You're late, why? He's good, you can go. - My apologies, I'm sorry. - Mr. Warshaw does not like nonsense. He went downstairs to the editing bay. He really doesn't like to be disturbed. I tell you what, come here. Now Mr. Warshaw likes your script, okay. - Okay. - [Barry] I'm gonna make an exception for you. - Barry, a couple of gentlemen are here to see you. - [Man] Barry! - Gentlemen! Three flights down, last door on the right. - [Man] Barry! - [Barry] How was your flight to L.A.? - [Man] It was great, let's do this! - What the fuck are you looking at? Get the fuck out of here, bitch! - Sorry. - [Man] Now you're working for me. So get over here and sign this fucking contract. Or you and your movie will disappear. - I'm starting with a clean slate. (Men grunting) - Oh my God, sorry, I didn't know you guys were filming. (Men grunting) (tense music) (heavy breathing) (Jake screams) (knife slicing) - All right, I know you! You're Jake! I know your Mama. Let me, wait, wait. Give me a minute. Your Mother, she was Angie Malone's manager. I read your script, it's good man. I fucking been looking for a good script. I don't even fucking know how long man. You're a fucking talented person. All right? I mean there's fucking holes, there's holes in your script, all right, but we can fix that. You just, you just fucking help me with this guy, all right. C'mon, c'mon, c'mon, Jakey, give me your hand. I'll direct your fucking movie, please. You gotta help me with this fucking guy, all right Jake? - No, please. Please don't make me do that. - Jake, Jake, Jake. - [Walt] C'mon, c'mon Jake. I'm gonna make your fucking movie, all right? I'm gonna make your movie, it's okay. I need your help. Give me your hand, all right? Motherfuckers! (Walt stuttering) (Jake screaming) (Jake gasps) (hammer clanging) (slow rock music) (tense music) (car screeching) - [Barry] Mr. Warshaw? - What is it Barry? - We have a problem. - [Walt] Vincent Rose. Fucking Angela's Dad is driving me crazy. Don't let Jake talk to him. (Countdown beeping) ♪ See me out ♪ ♪ I be what gangsta do ♪ (man coughs) - [Man] This guy looks like a cop man. - He's worse than a fucking cop. - Yeah. - He's a fucking screenwriter. - [Walt] Do you know how much that fucking boat is costing? 3,000 a day! When you're writing screenplays, you gotta think about where your setting the scenes. That's an arm and a leg, yours! - Sorry. - Anybody follow you? Now there are people, all right, who wanna, who they're out to get me. They wanna know what it is that I'm interested in. What'd I tell ya? What did I tell ya? All right. Why don't you see if you could find yourself a part in there. Now we're talking. So Jake, why don't you, chop us up a line. (Men grunting) Now I'm serious, there's a couple roles in here. There's bouncer and there's thug number one. I think you're-- - Walt. - [Walt] Yes Jake, what is it? - This is the knife. - Dude, I'm just fucking with you. It's all right. Here, look, put it right there. It's okay, we're making a fucking movie, Jake. All right, that's the fucking movie business. Look, why don't you talk to these boys, all right. And explain some of the background on their characters. Give 'em some motivation, 'cause I gotta make another call, and get us another location. It's fine, it's fine. - Hey, hey, hey. - [Man] Sit down. (Phone beeps) - [Angela] Who was that? - It was about the film. - Oh. - Yeah. - [Jake] What's wrong? - Nothing. - What's wrong? - Nothing. Stop. You haven't even introduced me to the director. I just feel like you're stringing me along. - I'm not stringing you along. - Then why am I hearing that there's offers out? - He wants a star. He thinks it's like necessary for distribution. Stupid, I know. And I'm gonna get you a smaller role. - How 'bout I give you a smaller role. (Angela scoffs) - Now he, he is a bad guy. All right, and we're the good guys Jake. You and me, we're the fucking good guys and this is the bad guy. (Slow paced music) - You know who just emailed me just now was Walt's assistant. And she wants me to show up, talk to Walt about the script. Supposedly we're supposed to meet with some very important people. As a matter of fact, why don't I bring you? Would you like to meet the director of "Lost Angela"? Would you? (Angela giggling) Would you like to meet him? - Yeah. - [Jake] Would you like to star in the film? Do you want me to tell him, "Walt! Angela is playing Angie Malone, and that's that. No! And don't make me shut you up Walt. (Angela chuckles) You wanna work on this film? You get Angela to do the role. Yeah you want the role? - [Angela] Yes, come here.

Eyes up jackass! - Sorry about that. - Hey, Jake. - [Jake] Have you seen Angela? - [Barry] Yeah, upstairs mate. - Okay, thank you, thank you. - Fuck. - Walt, we need to talk contracts. - You send her up to my room and I'll give her a producer's credit. - That's not the way it works. - C'mon baby. All right. - Angela. - What? You okay? - Yeah. - Are you nervous? - You know, I was thinking that, maybe it's not a good idea to let him know about us. - [Angela] Why? - It just makes us look unprofessional. - Jake, don't worry about that. Just go over there and tell him that you wrote the part for me, and that I'm playing Angie Malone. That's why we came, so that you could tell him, right? Wait, who are those other girls? Are they actresses? - Yeah. They're, I think they're in the movie. - Playing who? There's only Sophie and Angie Malone. - Well, I'm gonna take care of that-- - Jake. - Walt, hi, good to see you. Hi. Thanks for inviting me. - Good good, glad you made it. - [Jake] And this is my friend, Angela. - Angela. - His friend, Angela. - [Walt] Another Angela, I'm surrounded by Angelas. I have Angelas coming out of my ears. On that note, we need to talk about the script. - Thank you. You know Walt, Angela is an actress. A really good actress. - So what have you done Angela? - Well, you did, she played Lady Macbeth. - Really? - Yeah. - [Walt] I did Macbeth myself actually. Is this a dagger which I see before me, the handle toward my hand? Come, let me clutch thee. I have thee not and yet I see thee still. Art thou not, fatal visions sensible to feeling as to sight? - I didn't even realize you were such a great actor. - [Angela] You're so good. Cheers. - What we gotta do is we're gonna have to re-work all of Angie Malone's scenes, okay? Now don't worry, it's not because there's anything wrong, it's just that it's not, it's not sexy enough. I mean just take a look at Juliet. She's beautiful right? The most beautiful girl you've ever seen. The way you've got it written it's like she's a matron. - [Jake] Right. - It's like you're writing about your own mother. I mean it's ridiculous, you gotta get in touch with the sexuality. I need it to be seductive. Every scene with Angie Malone has to be seductive. Okay, so, - Yeah, so. - [Walt] on that note, excuse me, Angela, I'm gonna go and introduce him, come on. - [Jake] I'll tell him in a minute. - [Walt] So that's the writer. - [Jake] Hi, Juliet Marquez? - Nice to meet you. - Nice to meet you. You're gonna be fantastic as Angie Malone? - Oh, thank you. - [Walt] Yeah, as Angie. I mean seriously, who else could play Angie? Tell him which parts you feel like, you know, what were we saying? So what I was thinking is why don't you have a discussion with Juliet, - Okay, okay. - [Walt] and take her notes okay? I've heard them all before, - Okay. - [Walt] every few hours. And so I'll leave it to you and you just be nice to him okay? He's a good writer. Excuse me Jake. - [Jake] Okay, thank you, thank you. - [Juliet] Yeah, so, I've read the script 100 times. - I wanted to say that I'm such a big fan of your work. - Really? - Yes. - Thank you. - [Angela] And I completely agree about Angie Malone being more sexual and seductive. I feel that I can relate. - Hesitant, you know. She wants my role. - Oh, I think a lot of people do. - Yeah, well, she's perfect for Sophie, okay. - Okay, okay. - Be convincing. - [Juliet] Lana! - Since the vampires are going to get their fangs into Jake, I can give you a little tour of the house. If you'd like? - All right. - I've read your script and she's been trying to talk me into doing Sophie's part and its just... - Come on! - I really, I really-- - [Juliet] Like we would be, oh my God, such a perfect cast for the movie! - I really like the part of Angie though. I think it's a little competitive here. (Slow tense music) ♪ What to believe ♪ ♪ Your eyes ♪ ♪ Seem to hide in plain sight ♪ ♪ Onto a world ♪ (door slams) ♪ No light ♪ ♪ Will be shed to heal all your spite ♪ - So, Jake, your friend Angela is quite a revelation. (Angela laughs) I just don't understand why you didn't introduce me to her before. - Can I talk to you? Where have you been? - [Jake] Did everything go okay? - Yeah, everything went really good. - Did you talk about the script? - We talked about the script and he wants me to play Angie Malone. - [Jake] You're gonna play Angie Malone? - Yeah. - [Angela] Shh, shh, shh, shh. - [Juliet] How much did she inspire you? - [Walt] This role isn't right for you and you know it! - She's crazy. - [Walt] That's why you're getting so insecure right now. It's gonna kill your fucking career, because nobody's gonna buy you in the role! I've known that, you've known that. - Where's the ring? - Jake. - [Juliet] Did you fuck her? Did you fuck her? (Jake stutters) - I don't know what she's talking about. Your idea worked, about us, about Walt not knowing about our relationship, and I think that it's a good idea. We should take a break. - No. - Yeah, for the film. I love you, but I-- - I love you too. No, no, no, don't do this, because look, look, look-- - Jake, just for the film. (Tense music) (Juliet crying) - Sweetheart, Juliet! - The party's over! The party's over! - I'm sorry! (Church bells ringing) (upbeat music) - [Angela] Hi Jake, thanks for coming! Hi, I've been thinking of you. - You've been thinking about me? - Yes, I have sweetheart. I miss you. - I miss you too. - Are you okay? Just with everything that happened, I just... Are you okay? - Well, actually, I was thinking maybe we could talk more in private. - I gotta go. I'll be right back, we'll talk later, okay? - Yeah, there's just a lot I wanted to talk-- - [Angela] We'll talk later. Yeah, we'll talk. - Okay. - Who's that? - Is that Holly Young? - [Woman] Is that Holly Young? I love her. - Why did you wait so long - [Walt] to tell me you wanted to play Angie Malone? - [Holly] It takes me a long time to commit because I have to live and breathe her. - That's what I'm talking about! Someone who wants to dive so deep they never wanna come up for air! (Classical music) Let me see that profile. - I just wanted to come over and thank you for being a part of my movie. - Wow, the "Lost Angela" herself thanking me. After stealing my role. - Stealing your role? You know, this entire movie was my idea? Did you know that Jake wrote this movie for me? - [Juliet] Oh, really? - Uh-huh. Yes, that's right. And Walt is directing for me. - Wow. You work really fast. You're like a shooting star. (Both laughing) You know they vanish, right? - Oh, well, you would know. - You really have no idea who you're fucking with. (Angela giggling) - I know who I'm fucking, and they say for better or for worse. (Tense classical music) - [Holly] So, what's the offer exactly? - The offer is you have the role of Angie Malone if you want it. - [Holly] If I can't capture her spirit or soul, then I can't do it. - I'm gonna push your fucking buttons. If you're not gonna let me push your fucking buttons, then I don't want you to play the role. So are you gonna let me push your buttons? Are you? For real? - [Holly] Only if it's worth it. Then you can push my buttons. - That's what I'm talking about. - [Jake] What's going on? - Now that's a real actress. She's fucking been nominated twice. All right? Because she's not fucking afraid to have her buttons pushed. Angela, your Angela, every time I fucking push her buttons, she's like, "Well I'm Angela, I am Angie Malone, "you don't have to do this to me." Well I fucking do! Because she thinks that just by the mere fact that you wrote the role for her that she's fucking living the part. She's not! We need a fucking star! Otherwise this movie is gonna go down the toilet! I'm gonna make a fucking offer. I'm gonna fucking make an offer to Holly Young. She's fucking incredible. She doesn't fucking care about the money, she just fucking wants to... I think she likes me. - This is the biggest mistake you're gonna make. - [Walt] Jake. - You're gonna make me take the police there aren't you? Huh, discover the bodies, is that what you're gonna make me do? - Are you telling me you wanna fucking sacrifice the opportunity to have a fucking hit movie, to get your girlfriend to stay in this role, even though she's not gonna cut it? Is that what you're saying to me? Just look at me one time, right now. You are never, ever gonna fuck her again! (Classical dramatic music) 'Cause you're fucking Jake, Holly Young didn't get the fucking role, right? Angela! You've got the fucking part! Holly Young, Holly Young, Holly Young! (Keys clanging) (door slams) - John? John! (Tires screeching) - [Man] Vehicle has gone over the side of Mulholland Drive. And unfortunately law officials are not ruling out the possibility of a suicide here. This all stemming from the swirling rumors of the Senator's torrid affair with film star Angie Malone. And as we all know, the Senator's wife has been battling depression ever since this news was disclosed. Mulholland Drive, involving the wife and child of Senator John Russell. And now we'll get back to-- - Cut! Angela, you know you're in and out of character right? This is the scene, where you realize that your behavior has caused the death of John Russell's wife and child! You've gotta make a connection with that! If you don't make a connection we're not gonna make a connection, the camera's not gonna make a connection, all right, honey? If you can't figure this out, then we're just gonna have to go home. Because this is the most important scene, of the whole fucking movie! - Can I talk to you for a second? - All right, just give me five. - Okay. - All right everybody, take 10! (Slow paced music) - I'm sorry, it's just hard for me to concentrate because Jake keeps staring at me through the mirror. It's so awkward. Can you just tell him to. Pull him aside or something? - We're trying to make a movie here! Trying to get a performance out of Angela! You can't come and fucking get in the eye-line of the actress, don't you get it? - I didn't do anything. - All right. - [Walt] It's not Kindergarten. I can't have you on the set if you are gonna distract our leading lady! - I won't. - What do you mean? You've already done it! Now you've distracted me! - No, I-- - [Walt] Cut it out, Jake! - No-- - [Walt] For crying out loud! Look, I don't wanna use any of this shit! - I won't do anything. I'm just gonna stand-- - Get off my fucking set you prick! Get off my set! Angela. Get off! So immature, Jake! You're so immature. - I think you better leave. - Fuck you Walt! (Glass shatters) You're on my set! I fucking wrote this movie! Fuck you Walt! Fuck you! Get off my fucking set! - [Sophie] Are you okay Jake? (Ominous music) - [Jake] Mom, I got thrown off the set. - [Sophie] Please sit down. - Mom, I'm not gonna sit down, I got thrown off the fucking set! - I've seen this happen before. - What, people thrown off their own fucking set, because I got thrown off in front of my ex-girlfriend! - [Sophie] Angie's been thrown off the set many times, for a time it went undiagnosed and then the doctor gave her medicine for schizophrenia. - Mom, why didn't you tell me this before? I could have put this in the movie, why didn't you tell me this mom! - I'm telling you now, okay. It can be hereditary and I want to treat it. - It's too late, they're already making the movie! And I can't put it in now! (Heavy breathing) Angela. (Ghostly winds) (birds chirping) (doorbell rings) - Jake. Come in. How are you? (Slow gentle music) - Is Walt in? - No, he just stepped out. Can I get you something? - We had a meeting. Can you tell him that I stopped by? - Yeah. - And I guess I'll see him tomorrow. - Yeah. (Teapot whistles) I just made some tea. It's really good, you should try it. I lost like three pounds. - I have to tell you something. You completely captured Angie Malone. - Oh my gosh. - You looked really beautiful. (Slow gentle music) (Jake stutters) How's Walt treating you? Is he treating you well? - I'm just waiting for the film to come out. He thinks I'm overeating. He's starving me, that's why I'm drinking this tea. I'm depressed all the time, I don't know what to do. I just wanna just... I just feel like I wanna shave my head off. I just miss my old life. (Zipper opening) - [Vincent] I'm a very doting and protective Father, you can understand that, can't you? - [Jake] Yes sir. - Yeah. I'm gonna ask you for a very personal favor. I wanna feel that she's looked after. She's protected through all this madness. Can I rely on you? - Yeah. - I'm gonna hold you to that. You got that Jake? - Yes. - Okay. Good. - Daddy! - [Vincent] Hi. - I'm so glad you're here! - Good to be here. - I'm so stressed out. - [Angela] We're shooting a magazine editorial scene. - I see, I know, I got it. - [Angela] That's why I have this outfit on. - If I can say, your daughter is so amazing in the film. - I'm sure. - She's so talented. We didn't know what she - Thank you. - [Jake] was going to do from take to take. - Yeah, yeah, she takes after her Mother. I can tell. - Well, the film is actually not doing so well. It's been out for like a week and no one's seeing the movie. - Oh. But you're nominated for-- - Best actress. - Wow! - [Angela] Yeah, it's a big deal. It would be really nice. - What if you don't go to the awards show? - What if I win best actress? (Slow paced music) This could make my career. - Exactly. You don't go to the awards show and we do a publicity stunt. Angela Rose has gone missing. Now can you imagine this. Star of "Lost Angela" missing. - Miss Rose is now more popular than ever with almost every entertainment show, including us, wondering where can she be? - [Jake] I really enjoyed hiding out with you, and it's got me thinking. I'd like to give us another chance. - Jake. I told Walt. - I um... How did he take it? I didn't know you were gonna tell him this soon. But it's better this way. We don't have to lie, we don't have to sneak around. ♪ When all is done ♪ ♪ At least I'm one ♪ - Is everything all right? ♪ The road I'm on ♪ ♪ I've been riding around, riding the town ♪ ♪ Walking the streets up and down ♪ ♪ Following roads to nowhere ♪ - [Angela] It's not that I don't love you, 'cause I do. I just, I want us to work, but it's just Walt and this contract, and it's all my fault. - You're lying, I can tell. ♪ They never asked me why ♪ ♪ The day that I left ♪ ♪ I was second best ♪ ♪ A nowhere child ♪ ♪ Guess the day will come ♪ - Angela, Walt hurt some people with the knife and he got my fingerprints on it. Is that why you're going back to him? (Ambient music) (door cracks) You're blackmailing her with the knife, is that what you're doing? - He's delusional. I don't know what you're talking about! Jake! This is Jake, this is the writer I was telling you about! - Hi Jake. - Very, very, talented guy. He'll write you a fucking part in his next movie, but you might have to sleep with him. And he might stalk you a little bit. Hm? She's not here, get the fuck out. This is Hollywood. You really want to get into this business? Your friend Jake paid me a little visit this evening. Yeah, he was looking for you. I told you to stop fucking him. (Angela gasps and coughs) (ominous music) Didn't I baby? (Water splashing) (tense music) (door banging) - I woke up on my lawn (heavy breathing) and I couldn't remember anything. - [Radio] The Senator's torrid affair with Film Star Angie Malone. (Glass shatters) And as we all know, the Senator's wife has been battling depression ever since this news was disclosed a few months ago. So again, a car crash involving the wife and child of Senator John Russell. Back to you. - Angela Rose, the star of the, at this point, ironically titled "Lost Angela" has missed two award ceremonies for her breakout performance. An unusual move for a rising star. - That disappearing act really worked. I mean she didn't even show up for her award. Don't you think you went a little too far? (Angela gasping) (ominous music) - It was a late one last night, Jake. - Angela Rose. - What Jake? - I think I saw Angela Rose dead. - Don't fuck with me! Okay. What are you trying to pull? What are you trying to pull, all right? This was your idea Jake. It's a publicity stunt. And this, this is gonna be your saving grace. Don't fucking lose the plot now, all right? What? You really don't remember, is that it? - [Jake] Remember what? - I like that okay, that's very good. You know what, you're a fucking genius! I told you do not fucking talk to me about Angela, right? Please Jake, don't unravel on me now, okay? Mr. Memento. (Suspenseful music) (phone ringing) - [Secretary] Yes, Mr. Warshaw. (Phone ringing) (people chattering) - Girls, wait up! - Elena, wait! - Shut up Becca! - Mom is all the way back there! (Ghostly winds) What? (Becca screams) (door knocking) - Looks like your kid's in the shits again. - Blow? - [Bennie] Walt Warshaw, homicide. (Door knocking) - Hello ladies, Ed Robles, LAPD. - Hi. - [Ed] How are you today? - Hi, good. - So, let's get started. I'm looking for Mr. Walt Warshaw, have you seen him? - He's not in right now. - Yeah, we're all looking for him. - Whoa whoa wait, turn around. Never turn your back on LAPD, it'll get you in a lot of trouble. When's the last time you saw Mr. Warshaw? - [Blonde] Yesterday. - Yesterday, okay, that's much better. Now how about Jake Hart, you seen him around? - [Blonde] No. - You haven't seen Jake at all? When was the last time you saw him? - Saturday. - Ah, good. You've been very cooperative. I like that. Wait a minute, you're not his secretary, you're that movie star, Lana aren't you? Oh my gosh, what a nice surprise. Oh I love your movies. - Thank you. - You're terrific. (Ed clears throat) Miss Secretary? - Yes? - I gotta make a pit stop, can you tell me where the bathroom is? - Actually I can't, we're closed. - Sorry - Okay, I'm gonna give you one more chance, and if I don't get the answer I like, I'm gonna take you in, cuff ya, and put you downtown with the lesbians. Would you like that? - No. - Good. - [Ed] Once again, where's the bathroom. - To the left. - Thank you. Hey, I'll see you in the movies huh? - Yeah. - [Ed] All right, good. - [Lana] Okay, so he's out with Juliet. Is there anybody else? What about his partners? Is there anybody else in this building or is it just you in here? (Ominous music) - Ooh, bingo. What is that? Looks like a little bit of blood, huh? See what you're up to Mr. Warshaw. (Door closes) - Angela. Angela. (Footsteps approaching) Where's Angela? (Walt crying) I remember the first time I saw Walt Warshaw's "Omega". I was with my Mom. I went home and I prayed for God to give me a sliver of your talent. And whatever he asked for in return was fine by me. - Hi sweetheart. (Hand slapping) - Did you just do some blow? She's a method actress. That's why we cast her as Angie Malone. I gave everything that I fucking could! I've got such a fucking deep black fucking hole in my fucking soul. That's what I've got. I feel like, I feel I'm gonna die. Not just once, but a million fucking times over. Why? Hey. Jake? Why is that? You're looking for Angela aren't you? - What happened to her? - You don't remember do ya? You fucking idiot! (Body thuds) (high pitched ringing) I made you who you are. Without me you're nothing. And I'm warning you. That if you fucking dare, if you fucking dare try to bring me down, you're gonna bring yourself down. Angela is lost and she's gonna stay lost Jake, that's just the way it's gonna be, forever! (Voice echoes) (ambient music) - [Jake] Angela. - Only your Mother used to call me that. - You're Angie Malone. (Ghostly whispers) - You were so little. You couldn't say Angela so you called me Angel. You were so cute. You know Sophie used to record you playing and send the tapes to me, and I'd listen to them until they wore out. I was always there for you, you just couldn't see me. No one knew about you and I had to keep it that way. I had to give you away, I couldn't take care of you, I was really sick. I had to give my baby to Sophie. - I'm your son. - Yeah. (Jake gasps) I didn't wanna give you up, but I had to. - You have to tell him, the baby. I wanted to protect you. The doctor gave her medicine for schizophrenia. - I've got this director, he's trying to make me go crazy. He's following me, he's having me followed. I think he's recording me, he's bugging me, he's planting evidence on me. I'm not safe. My girlfriend, she's not where she's supposed to be. She's supposed to contact me and she hasn't. Something went wrong and I don't know what it is. - Two bodies were discovered yesterday in the desert. And the plot thickens. Screenwriter of the movie "Lost Angela" wanted. - And when you're better, then we can meet again. - Hello Ed. - [Ed] Jake-- - [Jake] Wait, Ed, I need help. I'm turning myself in. - [Costa] Remain still. Did you witness any stabbings on June 13th at Warshaw Studios? - No. (Door knocking) - [Costa] What's going on? - [Ed] Interrogation's over. - [Costa] Did you take a look at the readings here? Readings are off the chart! - [Ed] It's over. - [Costa] It's your lucky day. - Sit. Sit down! We spoke with Walt Warshaw, she's fine. Said you cooked up some publicity stunt about her fake disappearance. - I did not cook up. No, no, no, that has nothing to do with it! - How did you get mixed up in this crap? I mean I know you're a confused kid, but you're not capable of murder. - I don't know. - [Ed] What don't you know? (Camera shutters) - [Photographer] Gorgeous! Walt, look. - [Walt] No, that's fantastic. Thank you. Hey darling can you just stop smiling a little bit and just remember the character? - [Photographer] Okay, can you get back? - Okay get back to it. Hey Vincent. - I'm sorry to interrupt, no secretary there so I just invited myself in. - I gave her a vacation. They burn out around me very fast. Have you heard from Angela? - Well you see, she hasn't been answering my phone calls. - Well I haven't heard from Angela either. I don't really know what's got into her. She hasn't called me for like a week at least. She's a method actress, that's what it is. - A method actress! Oh my God. Is it like Marlon Brando, you know. - James Dean. She's very talented. Who does she get that from? - She gets that from her Mother. - She doesn't talk about her Mother, what's-- - She lost her. She was very young. - Yeah, I figured as much. I mean, they're so complicated, aren't they? - Yeah. - I don't know what's going on with her. I gave her a couple of days off to, you know, lay low while we're doing all the PR for this film, and suddenly she's vanished off the face of the earth. - If you're not watching the pictures, what are you doing here? - You know darling, I've gotta make a call. Excuse me Vincent. - [Woman] And a nominee for best actress has gone missing.

(Heavy breathing) (ominous music) - You're having a bad day Jake. - [Jake] Where are we? - Oh, that's not the question. Question is, where's my daughter? I've been looking for her. - [Jake] I can't remember. (Gate clanks) (Jake screams) - Well maybe I gotta do something to jog your memory. - I can't remember. I swear to God, I can't remember. (Gate clanks) (Jake grunts) - [Vincent] You're pissing me off, and I am the wrong man to piss off! - Wait. She, she was on a publicity stunt. - Just tell me where she is and don't give me any of that publicity stunt bullshit! - You talked to Walt. - Just tell me where she is and all this will go away. - This would be murder, Jake! - Just tell me where she is! (Gate clanks) - [Jake] I don't remember. I don't remember! I saw her dead. - Really? - [Jake] Yeah. - Well like dead, dead? (Gate clanks) - He said Angela's lost. - And she's gonna stay lost, Jake! That's just the way it's gonna be, forever! (Angela gasps) - She's dead. (Angela gasps) (water splashes) (Jake grunts) I'm so sorry. (Knife slicing) It was Walt. He killed her. He sliced her throat. He killed her. (Gate clanking) (door slams) - So what the fuck do you want? - You killed her just like you did those drug dealers. - Jake, how many times do I have to tell you, if there's no witness, there's no murder. - I know you didn't mean to kill her. - Jake, I wish that it was an accident. I wish with all my heart. - Yeah, well, me too because... - Walt Warshaw, you're under arrest for murder. - [Bennie] Hands behind your back. You have the right to remain silent. Anything you say may be used against you in a court of law. - You're lucky they got here before me. You ain't gonna last a week in jail. - Yeah, well this ain't gonna stick, all right. 'Cause the kids memory has gone to shite. - Let's go creep. Come on, let's get out of here. - Come on. - Get out of here. - [Jake] I'm sorry. - Me too. (Ambient music) (countdown beeping) - Very interesting stuff here Mr. Warshaw-- - Cut! Thank you very much! Mr. Robles, can you try that again? That was not very convincing. I would like to see you do that again with a little bit more conviction. - Are we in a movie here? - Like you actually believe that you're gonna be able to put me away! Everything that you've got on me is circumstantial and it's not gonna stick! In fact, I don't understand why you're not happy these guys are off the streets! - You know I'm gonna be happy when you're off the streets. - And why is that? Is that because I took an aspiring young actress, with a cocaine problem out of the club scene and I cleaned her up and turned her into a star? So what if I made her a couple of promises along the way that I wasn't gonna keep? Does that make me a murderer? Or does that make me a movie director? Hm? - Where's Angela Rose? - You know, that is just another Hollywood mystery. (Church bells ringing) - What are you wearing tonight? - It's vintage Betsy Johnson. - Armani. - [Woman] I love your shoes. - Thank you. - They're Calvin Klein. - I can't wait to see who is gonna win best actress. - Angela Rose. - Angela Rose. - Angela. - Angela Rose. - [Julian] Angela Rose. - Angela Rose. - I think she could win Best Actress. - Angie! - I met Angie Malone about 35 years ago in London. - I really can't wait to see who's gonna win Best Movie. - Walt Warshaw, yeah. Without a doubt. - I know Walt, really well, and the person that they are trying to make him, he's not that guy. - I think any young actress would have really been able to soar with that rich dialogue, that complex character, thanks to the talented screenwriter Jake Hart. - Do you think Walt Warshaw had something to do with her disappearance? Was it a publicity stunt that went wrong? - Well, Angela is showing soon on the red carpet. She'll be here. - Really? It's surprising you say that when the current rumor is that you accused Walt Warshaw of murdering her. - That's just a-- - I think that what Jake means to say is that it's a case of life imitating art. Right, Jake? - And here, - [Woman] we have Walt Warshaw, director of the "Lost Angela." - Come on Jake. - Thank you. - [Walt] Lets go have a chat too. We're just talking about your movie Jake. Oh hi, Ted, good to see you. - Good to see you, yeah. How ya doing? - Very good. - [Ted] This is my girlfriend Kim. - Hi. - This is Walt. - Lovely. - How ya doing? - [Walt] Good thank you. Would you mind getting the fuck out of here? Oh Jake, Jake. You're never going get through the fucking night. I think you missed me, didn't you Jake? They held me a little bit longer than expected. All right, let's try to have a good time tonight. It's a big night. (People chattering) - [Woman] Where's Angela Rose? - You're a scumbag. I can't believe they let you out. - Well I told you, it's all circumstantial didn't I? - It's not circumstantial. They have me. I'm the witness. - Nothing you say can be used in court Jake, because you're suffering from schizophrenia. - You're the psycho! You're the one that tried to frame me. - He's having a bit of an anxiety attack. Cheers. (Fast paced music) Breathe through your nose, come on. You fucking attacked me, don't you remember? You attacked me because you wanted the knife back. You swung. (Angela gasps) - [Angela] Jake! (Head thuds) Oh my God! (Walt grunting) - [Jake] Angela, you okay? Get out of the way. I'm not playing around, I want the fucking knife. Where's the knife? Where is the fucking knife? - The fucking knife, the knife is our fucking contract, Jake! - Oh fuck your contract! She's only with you because she's trying to protect me! - Fuck you Jake! (Dramatic music) (knife slices) (Angela gasps and coughs) (water splashes) Jake, that's how you killed her. I know it's rough, but I'm your friend. (Slow rock music) (dramatic music) - No. No. That was fake blood. It was my plan, it's how I got you to confess. - What? - My mom, remember how she forgot everything the year Angie Malone died because it was too traumatic for her? - Yes. - [Jake] What if I lose my memory? What if Walt believed that I don't remember anything? - [Angela] Make sure to get his confession before the awards. - I was telling people that you murdered Angela and you got so flustered. You were trying to get me to remember, remember Jake, that you accidentally confessed to killing those drug dealers. (Jake imitates gun firing) Your career is over. You're done. You are done. Angela is returning on this red carpet tonight. She's gonna be getting that award, and Angie Malone is my birth mom. She is going to show up here. - Of course she is Jake. - Yeah. - All right, I know how you're feeling. You tried to kill yourself and I've given you enough Ketamine to knock out a fucking elephant. But I, I fucking dug her grave. You killed her you fucking jealous cunt! I buried her with my own hands. You've got to hold it together now or you're gonna lose everything. - Angie Malone is coming here tonight. She is my real birth mother and you're gonna see Angela will show up on the red carpet. And tomorrow, you're going back to prison! Do not trust Walt Warshaw, he's a drug dealer. He is a drug dealer. - He is a great writer, he's a fantastic writer. We're working on a new script. - I'm gonna sue you and I'm gonna own Warshaw Film! - Mm-hm, yeah. You're gonna win an award tonight Jake. I voted for you. - You worked with him, you know what I'm talking about. You've seen him. (People chattering) (bells ringing) (crowd cheering) - [Angela] I'm so proud of you.
