I regret to inform you that we are declining to carry your designs. We wish you the best of luck with your future endeavors. Au revoir. It's okay. There's another message, there's another one. [woman on phone] Hi, honey. It's Mom. I'm trying to send you that thousand dollars you need... Are you borrowing money from your parents again? - I'm such a mess. - Oh, no, babe... - Everything's gone wrong. - No, you're not a mess. You just... You just need a little bit of TLC. - That's all. - [indistinct] Hey, look. You're gonna be great. Okay? I'll fix you up. I'll fix all of this. They're gonna love you. They're gonna love your designs, the buyers are going to give you an order that'll transcend your wildest dreams, yeah? - Yeah? - I don't know. If you say so. Okay. All right, love. Um, but maybe you should just have a little shower first. [woman on phone] Hello, thank you for calling Schmiegel Ad Agency. - How can I direct your call? - [phone ringing] [man] Tom? One day, this will all be yours. I built this whole empire, and my number one achievement to this day, MOFO Moonshine. Look at this art. Look at it. "Lick, swallow, and suck. No limes needed."

Whoa, check this out. - Holy smokes! - Hey, hey, wait. No, no, no, no... How do you turn this thing on? You're gonna break your neck. Those things are death traps. They kill people all the time. You can't even ride a bike. - You're gonna shoot through the roof... - [doors opening] Mr. Johnson, if you can wait one moment to... Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey. No man stands in front of the boss. Unless Little Jerry says so. [dog whimpers] Little Jerry, what do you say? [dog whimpers] He said it's okay. All right. What do you got, Irene? Um, well, we have the projection all set up for you. Come on. Wow me. [chuckles] Right. Okay. Well, you know, we were thinking to focus on this amazing innovation you created, and... Well, uh, Elon Musk, he has innovation. - Next. - Let's take the future technology and make it available for the consumer today. Apple. Smart and affordable. Next. [muttering] - What do you got? - Bye-bye. "Johnson Jetpacks. Making the future fun again." What did you say? "Making the future fun again." Well, Mr. Johnson, we're a quarter of the way into the 21st century, but the future isn't nearly as cool or wild as we dreamed. Until today. By making the future fun, we open the world's imagination. - I mean, look at this thing. - No, I... It is a beauty! This isn't just a jetpack that you created. It's like a... it's like, uh... - A vibrator for the mind. - Yes! It's like a vibrator for your mind. And what does the world need more than vibration right now? Nothing. The world needs vibration. So why don't you get over here, just strap on, ride hard, and blast off in a Johnson Jetpack? Tomorrow... is today. Idiots... You're saying it's like sex? Riding them hard and wet? Tomorrow is today? Is that what you're telling me? I just wanna apologize, that was... It's genius! It's brilliant! Where were you hiding this guy? You got a Don Draper on your team. And you, vibrations. Genius, genius. Why do you act so stupid? And who are you? Uh, my name's Tom. - Tom. - Tom, you're gonna be the new face of the Johnson Jetpack. Now put that helmet on. Let me see you in that jetpack. - Good, good. - Uh... - Model that baby. - Uh, okay. Oh, I like it. I think it's... I think it's on, man. - [powering up] - I think it's on. Get this off of me. Oh... shit. [yells] You pushed the wrong button. I told you this was stupid. [yelling] [Mr. Johnson] Excellent! Watch your head. [yelling] Stop! Man, that thing's way faster than I thought it would be. - [yelling] - Oh! That's gotta hurt. - [yelling] - Oh my gosh! What's he doing? - [clanging] - Oh. Good thing he's wearing a helmet. [grunting] [yelling] Fuck you, Ricky! - Look out! - [all yelling] Hmm. Okay. The finishing touches. - All right. - Don't do too much of that stuff. - Okay. - Okay. Just a little. Why is this mascara so clumpy? Did it expire? Does mascara expire? I don't know. Honestly, I don't really care what I look like. It's not like I'm trying to get picked up. Yeah, because that would be a nightmare. Men are a pointless distraction. That's kind of the point, babe. Speaking of distractions, I sent Molly out for the night. Thank God.

And, Molly, why don't you go to your room? Now. We can... Kind of little busy here. I brought Laura a friend. Because everyone knows that she could use a good fuck. Okay. That's enough. Just... go to your room. This one's for you. - Meet Mateo. - I'm Matias. He's Mateo. [Speaking Spanish] Mateo. Ma-tat-o. Who gives a fuck?

Can you please just leave? Yeah. Fine. I was gonna share, but since you're being so rude, I won't. Come on. Where were we? [chuckles] [exhales] Are you sure these people are real buyers? Yes. I found them online. They had great reviews. - [belching] - Huh. Who's the charmer? [Laura] He's a Pet Core representative. Employee of the month. - [Georgia] And the cat lady? - Uh, she's the owner of Feline's Behinds. - [Georgia] And... Judas? - [Laura] Uh, he just showed up.

Look, look, um, just wait. The... the... tuxedo. Tuxedo. You haven't seen anything yet. This is the grand finale. What kind of bridal party would it be if your little furry friends, furry friends couldn't walk down the aisle with them? You'll say "I do" to the exquisite designs of Doggie Style. [Molly moaning] [sheep bleating] [elephant trumpets] Look, I'm just the cashier for Pet Core. I think I responded to the wrong ad. Sorry. Um, do these come in human sizes? Um, also I need to pee, where's your litter box? Meow. Uh, where did you find these morons? Who's next? - This was an awful idea. - Hey, no, no, no, no. We will come up with a plan, okay? Speaking of plans, either of you have a plan B pill? Mr. Argentina forgot to pull out. Okay, look, you lazy, selfish, irresponsible nympho alcoholic. I am not lazy. And you look awfully tense. Wanna fuck? [sighs] Our roommate is going through a very difficult time right now. I think that some words of encouragement would be very much appreciated. Sure. Rent's due tomorrow.

I mean, can I buy one from you? Do you have a dog? I don't... No, I don't have a dog. Yeah, I'd probably fit it around one of my legs. [both laughing] That is the first time I've smiled in over a week. Well, you have a nice smile. - No, I don't. - Yeah, you do. No one wants to buy any of my designs. Well, I mean, I... I work in advertising. I can help you come up with some new stuff maybe and... Over dinner or, uh... Okay. But it... As long as it's not a date. What, you got something against... - against dating dudes? - No. I just told myself I'm not gonna date anybody until I make my first business transaction. Oh, well, then we... We gotta get on this. - Yeah. - Time's wasting. Poodle skirts. Poodle skirts for poodles. - Okay, you got some good ideas. - Right? Rottweilers in leather. Leather jackets around their butts. [laughing] [Tom] It was electric from the day we met. Thanks to everyone for coming and spending some time with us before the big day. We're really looking forward to the trip with both families. I've never been happier. Thank you so much for saying yes, Laura. Of course. That was beautiful. [woman] That was beautiful. Thank you so much. Hey, did everybody get enough to eat? - Oh, yeah. - It was good. - I could use... - It was good. Thank you. - ...another one of these. - [woman] You guys are adorable.

[Lance] Nothing. I'm really happy for you two. But can I ask? Why do we all have to fly down to this Caribbean hellhole for these nuptials? Why not have them at home? Why not Canada? Lance, you're not even Canadian. [all grumbling] Lance, what's wrong with you? - Don't you know where you're from? - Ricky, please shut up. Oh, you hadn't heard? I'm an orphan. [Laura] Oh, here we go. I didn't know you were adopted. Oh, that's true. I'm an orphan. All I ever really wanted was to be taken in... - [phone ringing] - ...by a kind family and then finally... [man on phone] Manfred? Manfred... ...these loving parents came along and adopted me because they couldn't have children on their own. It's... It's true. [groans] Until they did have a real kid, right? They were finally able to conceive and they had the miracle biological child, the golden girl, and she just kind of, I don't know, just took up all the love and old Lance just kind of got lost in the shuffle. - The hell am I missing here? - My life. - Well, that's nice. - Okay. Well... You sound successful. - Wow. It's so soft. - Sherry, Manfred, Lexi, thank you. And to your son, Tom, I'd just like to say, uh, son, if you break her heart, I'll kill you. That's a joke. It's just a joke. - [laughing] - Good speech. - He's joking, he's joking. It's a joke. - It's such a funny joke. [upbeat music] Hi, super cute couple. Can I offer you a pre-wedding trip beverage? Actually, I had a question. Um, when I was coming onto the plane, somebody was telling me about, urn, a Club Mile High, and I was wondering if... um, is that like a credit card thing where you have to sign up or do you, um...

And for the life of me, I cannot walk out those office doors without a top or bottom. Can I help you, Larry? Well, uh, first of all, this is a topnotch resort, so congratulations to you. Um, I was just... Had a question about the activities. There's zip line, paragliding, bungee jumping. All nude. Those are all totally nude activities you've mentioned. That's true. Actually, the bungee jump is closed due to an incident last week. A guy, older fellow... late 70s, early 80s... jumps. Old-timer's got incredible form, his head is at a safe distance, but his balls extend just enough to tap the sand really hard. Put him in the hospital... died the next day. I'm sorry to hear that. Nothing related to the bungee jump. My condolences. I think I understand what's happening here.
