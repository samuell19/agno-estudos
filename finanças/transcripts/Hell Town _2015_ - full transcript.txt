- [Narrator] Viewer discretion advised. (thunder booming) - Good evening. I am Debbie Rochon. Tonight on Twisted Classic Television we bring you Hell Town. A series that had quite a controversial and mysterious history. Seasons one and three were burned in a studio fire. Or so they say. Season two... Episodes seven, eight, and nine, were dug up. And when I say dug up, I literally mean dug up, in one of the producer's wife's cousin's sidekick's friend's graves. They wiped off all the decomposition, blood, and gore to digitally remaster it for your pleasure tonight. So I bring to you a killer series. Hell Town. (thunder booming) - [Narrator] Previously on Hell Town. - Oh Bill. I've got a horrible confession to make. A secret I've been keeping all these years. It's about our son. Oh Bill. I've got a horrible confession to make. (gagging) - Mom's in a coma! - Somebody splash water on her to wake her up. - Comas don't really work that way. - Have you at least tried? - [Doctor] Butch, your mother's in a coma. It's time to go home. (knocking) - Bobby, you can't tell anyone! - I'm your BFF, I won't. - I had an abortion. - [Mr. Gable Voiceover] You should have been my heir. - You don't deserve the debutante ball, Chanel. - [Laura] I heard Tyler Chapman was screwing around with Trish Gable. (suspenseful atmosphere music) (screams) (dramatic orchestra music) - You stupid bitch! - Calm down, Chanel. - Mama would never wanna cancel my debutante ball! You're just saying that because I'm adopted. - Chanel, the nurse was just saying that since daddy's dead, mama's in a coma, and we're not rich, maybe it isn't a good idea. - Bullshit! She's trying to take over! You better watch your step because you will never, ever take my mom's place. - Watch me. - Butch! Butch! - Oh Butch, I thought we'd never see you again. - How was juvi? - Surprisingly comfortable. But I'm glad to be home. - Well maybe you shouldn't have stolen all that money. - You know I didn't steal it. - Oh who cares. You're finally home. And now that you are, you can fire this stupid nurse and throw me the debutante ball I deserve. - But she's a professional. - That's right, Chanel. I'm the only one who can take care of your mother. - Bullshit, you stupid bitch! - We gotta do what it takes to get mama better. If it's a debutante ball that you want, little sister, then it's a debutante ball that you'll get. And mama can help plan it. Because she's gonna come back to us. Right mama? (ominous atmosphere sting) - Oh, hi Butch. - Oh, hey Laura. It is Laura right? - (laughs) Don't be silly, of course it is. - How's your younger sister Trish? - Enough about her, where have you been? I heard you were fishing in Alaska. I can just see you now with the waves crashing on your chest while you're wrestling sharks. - I was in juvi, remember? Somebody from your dad's company set me up for stealing. But it don't matter now. I had a chance to discover myself. - I can't wait to discover what you've discovered. Oh, Butch, you must come to the Seniors for Seniors Fundraiser. - Will Trish be there? - Probably. (dramatic atmosphere music) - [Bobby] Laura, where are the eggs? - What eggs? - The eggs that you were supposed to get from the store. God, guess I'm not eating breakfast again. - There are more important things in life than breakfast, Bobby. - Like what, Laura? Like good friends? - Good morning father! - I have an announcement to make. As you know, my days on this Earth are numbered. After that, my soul shall rise up to Heaven on the back of an angel where I am promised a good position amongst God's governing body. It has weighed heavily on where to leave my earthly fortune while I'm enjoying my heavenly fortune. The obvious choice would've been to my only son, a price and heir to my throne, but since he turned out to be a fruitcake princess instead, I'm left with no choice. Obviously I could divide the fortune up, but that seems like too much work. So after much deliberation, I have decided to leave it all to... One of you. (suspenseful atmosphere music) - So is that everyone in here, or does BJ count? - Where is BJ? - Laura locked her in the trunk again. - I did not, you did! - Bobby, go out and get BJ. I mean BJ your sister, not... Oh just go. - Butch Manly's back in town. I invited him to the Seniors for Seniors Fundraiser. - Isn't that Jesse's long lost brother? - Yes, and Butch is the brother to my boyfriend Blaze. - Isn't Butch, Jesse, Blaze, and Chanel's mother in a coma? - I thought old mother Manly was dead. - Enough! That poor sweet woman has suffered so. (coughs) - What's that a drawing of? - It's that dead guy from the paper. - Freak. - Well time for Meals on Skates. Homecoming responsibilities are so rewarding. Toodles! - Meals on Skates? God, are you kidding me? I wonder if that bitch even cares about anyone besides herself? She has it so easy. She gets whatever she wants, and now she is literally skating by on her good looks. It's just so unfair. - [Bobby] Hold still. - Bobby, are you even listening to me? - Yes, I get it, my sister is annoying, but if you don't want me poking your eye out, you'll hold still. - I just wish that she would skate into an oncoming train, or a cement truck. Or a live electrical wire on a rainy night. Or a truck delivering broken glass, or a snake pit full of snakes. - There, you're done. - Not bad. - Oh hi nurse. - Why hello. - You know, you look very familiar to me. - You look familiar to me too. Maybe I gave you a sponge bath one time. - Oh I think I'd remember that. - I think I would too. - When's mom going to wake up? - I don't know. Speaking of which, do you think that you could maybe watch her for a minute so I can go out and have a smoke break? - Of course. - Cool. If you need anything just yell out the window for me, okay? (phone rings) - Trish's phone. - [Manda] Oh my god, have you heard that Butch Manly is back in town? - Yeah, Laura told me. - I heard that he's been in juvi 'cause he stole something from your dad. - Oh Manda, don't give secondhand thoughts to those secondhand rumors. We have more important things to talk about, like what are we gonna wear to the Friday Fling tonight. I just can't decide. - [Manda] Don't know Trish, you look great in everything. - Oh Manda, you're the best BFF ever. I hope Blaze Manly's there. - Are you gonna go to the Friday Fling? - I wouldn't miss it. - Okay, continue. I'm sure that he'll be there. - I'm thinking about giving him my virginity. I know we've only been going together for three months, but something tells me he's the right one for the job. - That's awesome Trish, but it's not really your first time. - I'm talking about my other virginity, Manda. - [Manda] Oh. - Toodles for noodles! - Bye. God, she is so annoying! When are you gonna break up with her? - Not until she puts out. I put in too much time. - [Manda] Well that might be sooner than you think. (dramatic atmosphere music) - Hey there, Manly. You got a date for the prom yet? You sure your last name's Manly? Aw it's okay Manly, where you going? You can come on over here and powder my balls. You oughta ask that Gable girl. - You mean Bobby? - No. I meant the one with the tits. Huh, huh, huh? And trust me, they're real nice tits. Ask her out. (school bell rings) (dramatic atmosphere music) - What are you doing in my car? (suspenseful atmosphere music) (gags) (screaming) - The body of running back Todd Hendricks was discovered in his car late last night. It appears the teen was gruesomely strangled to death. His family made note that the letter on his school jacket was torn off, leading police to now refer to the suspect as the Letter Jacket Killer. (dramatic atmosphere music) (school bell rings) - Hi Trish. - Jesse, what are you doing? - I'm just going to... - Did you need something? - Will you go to prom with me? - [Trish] Okay. - Really? - I'll add you to the list. - What list? What are you talking about? - My list of potential prom dates, silly. A girl needs options. - I'd say he's no longer an option. - Aww, I guess you're right. You can take his place. There. I'll let you know when it gets closer to prom. Obviously Blaze is my first choice, but we'll see who can survive the cut. - Okay. Thanks. I guess. - See you around. - What are we gonna get? - I think I'll stick to virgin cocktails tonight, Manda. There's something on my mind. - Really? - Yeah. My father came in talking about his will again this morning. I think he might be close to death, and I really need to start thinking about how I'm going to manage running the company and keep up with my popularity in school. - He's leaving it all to you? - Who else would he leave it to? It's a big deal, Manda. I might have to give away some friends. Oh, hi Chanel. I didn't know you worked here. - My mama's in a coma, Trish. And home health care's not cheap. (dramatic sting) - Whoa, hi Butch. So good to see you, I'm glad you could make it. Do you wanna go inside and get some punch? If you're lucky, maybe you'll get lucky. - Who's that sexy girl over there? - That would be my sister Trish. - That's Trish? She's changed a lot. She's really... Grown up since I've last seen her. Oh no! That was close. - Yeah. It's a shame she didn't choke to death. - Thanks Butch. - Trish. I haven't seen you since that night at the drive-in. So many years ago. You know, when we did that thing. - What thing? - It really meant a lot to me. You being so patient and all. - Hi Blaze! - How's my favorite hot bod? - Why don't you go get us some drinks? I'll take a Curly Temple. - It's a Shirley Temple. - Okay. - Bro, you want anything? - I'm good. - Good to have you back, bro. - So? - I found you guys a nice hookup spot in the janitor's closet. I put down some blankets and there's some candles next to the mop bucket, it's gonna be perfect for one of your first times. - Oh Manda, you're the best girl a friend could ever have. - Jesse? - Jesus, Bobby! - Oh I'm sorry, I didn't mean to startle you. - What is it Bobby, what do you want? - I just wanted to say hello. And I was wondering if you wanted to hang out again sometime. - Look, I don't think so. - Want me to get you a beer? - Hey Trish. - Jesse! Wow. - You stay away from her, Trish is my girl! - I didn't do anything! - Leave him alone, he wasn't doing anything! - She's mine, got it? - You stay away from him, my brother's not cheap, Trish. - I can't stand her. - Hey, don't listen to her. You're not cheap. - She didn't say I was. - Shhh. - Come with me. There's something I wanna show you. (ominous atmosphere music) (thunder booming) Not so fast, speedy. - That's why they call me Blaze. - I just want this to be super special. It's not every day a girl loses her virginity. - Her what? - I want this to be romantic. - I thought Peter Coleman was the great devirginator. - Silly boy. He took my other virginity. - Maybe they oughta call you Blaze. - They already do. - Remember this one mama? I was so beautiful. So happy. 'Till I found my adoption papers. Is that why you always treated me different, mama? Like an outsider? Oh sure, go ahead and ignore me, you're good at that! You always used to tell me I was the prettiest girl in town, mama. But lately I just haven't been feeling that way. Trish is always there beating me at everything. It's not fair. I wish she would just die. You. - Be careful what you wish for Chanel. - And what's that supposed to mean? - Sometimes people get exactly what they want. (wind howling) - Yeah right, even if you could get any pussy you wouldn't know what to do with it. - Fuck you man, I've been laid before. - Oh yeah? By who, your mom? - Fucking gross, dude. - Your mom is not gross. She's hot. Hold this. I gotta take a piss. (ominous atmosphere music) - [Peter] Ahh! - The fuck are you doing? Fucking weirdo. Coleman? Peter? What the fuck? (suspenseful atmosphere music) - It appears the Letter Jacket Killer has struck again, claiming the lives of two more students whose bodies were found after being bludgeoned to death. - Blaze, we need to talk. Just meet me at our spot. Blaze? Blaze! Blaze, we need to talk. I know this sounds crazy, but I don't care. I've been studying the yearbook, I know what's going on. Blaze, why are you sitting here in the dark? Why won't you talk to me? Blaze, why aren't you answering me? Blaze you jerk! (screams) You? (groans) Why? (dramatic atmosphere music) - Who did it? Who's the Letter Jacket Killer? Stay tuned to find out. (creepy bell music) - Good afternoon, ma'am. - Come on. - [Broadcast Host] Do you actually have hips? (laughter) - What is beauty? (screaming) (ominous atmosphere music) - Finn! Finny! (heart beating) (screaming) (erratic violin music) - Please! - Not so perky now are you, bitch? - [Narrator] Previously on Hell Town. - Somebody from your dad's company set me up for stealing. - I thought old mother Manly was dead. - Enough! - Freak. - [Mr. Gable Voiceover] It has weighed heavily on where to leave my earthly fortune. I have decided to leave it all to one of you. - I'm the only one who can take care of your mother. - Bullshit, you stupid bitch! - We gotta do what it takes to get mama better. - I hope Blaze Manly's there. - Are you gonna go to the Friday Fling? - I wouldn't miss it. - Jesse? - Jesus, Bobby! - Oh I'm sorry, I didn't mean to startle you. - Hey there, Manly. Ask her out. - Will you go to prom with me? - [Trish] Okay. - Really? - I'll add you to the list. Wow, Jesse. - You stay away from her, Trish is my girl! - I didn't do anything! - Leave him alone, he wasn't doing anything! - [Blaze] Got it, she's mine! - Trish is always there beating me at everything. - I thought Peter Coleman was the great devirginator. - He took my other virginity. - I wish she would just die. - Be careful what you wish for, Chanel. - And what's that supposed to mean? - Sometimes people get exactly what they want. (gagging) - Peter? What the fuck? - [Betty] The Letter Jacket Killer has struck again. - I've been studying the yearbook, I know what's going on. Blaze? (screams) You? (groans) Why? (dramatic orchestra music) - [Narrator] The part of Laura is now being played by Jennifer Grace. - Oh hi Butch. - Hey Laura. - Sorry, Trish isn't home right now. - Good. That means that we have the house to ourselves then. - I would've vacuumed if I would've known you were coming over. - That's okay, I like a dirty house. Laura. Laura. Laura. Laura. - Laura, Laura? Laura? Laura, are you watching this? - The body count is up to four football players. Coach Perry, how have these murders affected your game plan? - Well I lost my running back, my star quarterback, and my best kicker. How are we gonna play? - What a douche. - It's just awful. Our poor team. I can't see us having a winning season after this. - Do you fear for your own life, Coach Perry? - Well yes I do. It appears that someone doesn't like football. You know, I'm gonna find this Letter Jacket Killer and I'm gonna put an end to this myself! (loud whistle) - Which player would be the hardest to replace? - Hendricks. Todd Hendricks. He was the best. - Todd Hendricks, wasn't he Trish's boyfriend? - One of them. (doorbell rings) - Is Trish home? (doorbell rings) - 'Sup? Is Trish home? (doorbell rings) - 'Sup? Is Trish home? (dramatic atmosphere music) - Hey Butch. Oh my god, we keep running into each other. Hey Butch! Oh my god, we keep running into each other! Hey! Butch! Oh my god! We keep running into each other! - Oh, hey Laura. - What are you working on? - My car. - (chuckles) I know, I mean what part of your car? - I didn't know you were into cars, Laura. - I'm into a lot of things, Butch. You know, once I inherit the company, I'm gonna run this town. I could even get you your job back at the factory. - I think there's too many bad memories for me there, Laura. I'm trying to move on. If you wanna do me a favor, maybe you could put in a good word for me with Trish. Maybe she'll even ask me to prom. - I think Trish's dance card is full. - What is that supposed to mean? - It means she's screwed every guy in town. If the Letter Jacket Killer really wants to kill everyone she slept with, then it's gonna be a really long list. (dramatic atmosphere music) - Manda isn't returning any of my calls. - Maybe she's tied up. - I need an ice cream. Will you be my driver? (easy listening music) - What do you want? - Oh you work here too? - Prom dresses aren't cheap, Trish. - First of all, I think you need some help with your drinking problem, and I can recommend a good AA group at the church on Main Street where I volunteer on Sundays, and second, it's too bad you're not nicer. I feel like we could've been great friends. It's a shame you can't handle that I'm naturally prettier than you. - You know what? - Chanel, we talked about this before. The customer is always right. - I'd like a vanilla ice cream. - Cup or cone? - Cup. That'll be $1.85, and stay away from my brother, he isn't interested. - Which one? - Blaze! I overheard Manda telling Suzie Deckhart that you have the hots for my brother Blaze. - Well whether I do or don't, it's none of your fucking business. - Oh that's right, because fucking is your business. (thunder booms) (suspenseful atmosphere music) (siren blaring) (dramatic sting) Goddamn stupid bitch! - [Bobby] Where's your ice cream? - I ate it. It was a super small one. - [Bobby] Trish, there's something I've been wanting to talk to you about. - Me too. Why does daddy always call you fruitcake and princess? - Well actually that's exactly what I wanna talk to you about. - Just because you like girly things and watching your weight doesn't make you... Wait a minute, I know exactly what's going on here. - [Bobby] You do? - Sure I do! You grew up with all of us girls and you were just trying to fit in. You don't have to worry about that, Bobby. We love you just the way you are. - I'm actually glad to hear you say that because, see, what I wanted to talk to you about was, well, boys. - Yeah, you're lucky you don't have to worry about boys. Girls are so easy! Well thanks for your advice, Bobby. It was helpful. - Mom. Mom. I think you can hear me. Mom, I have a problem. You always said that I could come to you with a problem. It's school. It's so... Hard. I don't know what to do. I can't sleep. I dream all night. Lots of dreams. I wake up all wet, I'm surrounded by all these hot, tight-bodied, muscular studs, and if I can't sleep with any of them, I wish they would all just go away! How do I get through this, mama? Truth be told, I fooled around a few times with Bobby Gable. I've stopped that though. (wood creaking) (ominous atmosphere music) Should I talk to Bobby? Should I ask him to come and help me through this? I'm so confused. Answer me, mama! Just what I thought. You're no help. Don't you understand, I think I'm gay! Oh god. Just the sound of it, I can't believe that came out of my mouth. I don't wanna be gay! You're right. Thank you, mama. I know exactly what I have to do. (music intensifies) (humming) ♪ She wants me squirting mustard all over her body ♪ ♪ 'Cause I want to take a big bite of you, baby ♪ (screams) (suspenseful atmosphere music) - [News Anchor] Breaking news, another brutal murder today. We go live to Betty O who has more details. Betty O, what can you tell us? - The police are still not sure if Coach Perry's death is connected to the Letter Jacket Killer, but let's put our heads together to crack this case. - [News Anchor] Thank you Betty O, sounds like we're pretty fucked. New details in last year's Christmas capers that had us-- - Coach Perry? Trish, ew! Daddy, I would never disrespect you like that. I'm very mature and discrete. And managerial. - Oh Booby, it's so simple. It's all in the eyes. Okay, think about something that you want. It could be anything, it could be a food or a drink. Pick a drink that you want. - Okay. How about a Malibu rum and pineapple? - Good. Okay, now you just think about it. Lust after it. Visualize it, taste it. Can you see it? - Yeah. - Now I wanna see you see it. Good, good. Now whenever this guy that you like is around, just sell how much you want him. Let him know how much you lust after him with only your eyes. He is your Malibu and pineapple and you wanna drink him. - Oh yeah, Jesse, I mean Jason, yeah that's his name, Jason, he's so hot. - There was a cute guy named Jason that came into the Kreem Kup the other day, right after your bitch ass sister threw her ice cream at me. - She did what? - Yeah, in front of the customers and the manager. She could've cost me my career. I hate her. I know she's your sister, but... - No, I understand, Chanel. Trish can be pretty awful. Sometimes she laughs at the gay jokes my dad makes towards me even though she doesn't know what it means. - That cunt! Oh please. She thinks she's better than everybody else and she's not. She'll see. She will pay. I'll make sure of it. - Once I inherit everything, I'll make her move to the basement. All right, anyway, back to me. So once I get his attention, what next? - Okay, after you get his attention, you go in for the kill. Say something like hey man, you wanna come over to my place for a beer? Men love beer. - What if he says no? - Then think of something else. I don't know, get him to your house and get him drunk. Then talk about your problems, how chicks don't put out. Bros help bros right? - Right. Dad, what are you doing here? - Mr. Gable, can I help you? - I came to visit your poor sweet mother. - Why would you wanna see mother Manly? - None of your business, fruit fly. Lorraine, why did this have to happen to you? Oh god. I feel so responsible. Please, please forgive me. I've always loved you. Please wake up so we can finally be together. - Slut. Everyone thinks you're so perfect, Trish. How could I be the only one who sees what a fucking cunt you are? It's never look at Laura. Look at how pretty Laura is. Isn't Laura nice and smart? We should invite Laura to the dance. You know, I'd be pretty popular too if I screwed every boy in town. What do we have here? Oh Trish. Did somebody get a new cum rag to wear at prom? Trish, what a beautiful dress. Oh thank you so much, do you like it? Yes Trish, where did you get it? The fucking dumpster? Oh that's so much better, thank you for helping me fix my dress, Laura! (laughs) Oh, how about a sleeveless dress? I think it'll show off your beautiful arms! I can't stand you! Stupid bitch, you get everything you want! How do you like that Trish? How's this, let me pin your corsage on you, you stupid whore! (sobs) Great. (ominous atmosphere music) - How can this be? What's the meaning of this? - Watch out for my nails! - You're taking Jesse Manly to prom? - Oh that. I don't think he'll be up for it, if you know what I mean. Besides, I'm wearing six inch heels to prom and I can't manage to use him as an elbow prop all night. I expect more. So much more. - You can't go with him. You can't speak to him. Is that clear? - Jeez, what's up your butt? - I'm serious Trish, stay away from Jesse. Or else. - Trust me Bobby, you have nothing to worry about. (thunder booming) (heavy breathing) (dramatic atmosphere music) (foot tapping) - Come on, give it to me. Come on. Come on man, give it to me. Fuck you doing, come on. (dramatic sting) (suspenseful orchestra music) - Ooooo! They're all so colorful. - Can I help you? - I've got this one. - Oh hi Chanel, I didn't know you worked here too. - Well we can't all afford plastic surgery like you, Trish. So are you thinking about moving anytime soon? - No, why? - Oh, I just thought since you've screwed every guy in town, it might be nice to move somewhere new and try some new guys? Some place where you don't know everyone. - You don't know what you're talking about. You're insane. - Oh that's right, walk away! And for the record, Blaze doesn't want you. He has taste. He knows a cheap tramp when he sees one. - Chanel, I won't be hurt by your pathetic little lies. - I'm not lying, you stupid bitch! - How dare you! You're just jealous because I won Homecoming Queen and you didn't. - Well at least I had a dress that fit. - Face it Chanel, there will always be the haves and the haves not. I have, and no matter how many minimum wage jobs you get, you, my poor, poor, poor friend, have not! - I'm not finished with you yet! (suspenseful orchestra music) - What are you doing? - Just die! I didn't realize you were so heavy. You really shouldn't eat so much. - I guess fighting lessons aren't cheap either. - You're finished! You small town whore! (thunder booming) (glass clinking) (dramatic atmosphere music) What the hell? (ominous sting) (glass clinking) (music intensifies) Trish! This isn't funny! (ominous atmosphere music) (whimpering) - (garbled) Help! Help! Please help me! (music intensifies) What are you doing? You bitch! (muffled gagging) - Q. Oh come on! - I thought that was a children's game. - It's a matter of life or death, Laura. - Everything's life or death with you, BJ. Obviously you're not mature enough to handle the inheritance. - What makes you think you're gonna get it? - Maybe the fact that I'm not a fucking freak? - Wow Trish, what's the occasion? - Oh it's for prom. Daddy bought it for me. - I thought you already had a prom dress, what happened to that one? - Oh that old thing? I didn't really like it. But I saw this one and told daddy I just had to have it! - Well it's stunning. - Stunning you always get what you want. - Bobby, this came for you. I don't know who it's from. What's a hosebeast? (suspenseful atmosphere music) (dramatic orchestra music) - Do you think the small town whore is the killer? Stay tuned. - Drink it! It's awful! - Don't make me drink it! - You whore! This is bad coffee! (door creaking) - Coffee doesn't have to be violent. You should be drinking Debbie Rochon's Kill-Devil Rum-Ble, brought to you by Coffee Shop of Horrors. - [Announcer] Kill-Devil Rum-Ble, blending rum and caramel for the smoothest cup of coffee you'll ever taste. - That's a good cup of coffee. - [Narrator] Previously on Hell Town. - I didn't know you were into cars, Laura. - I'm into a lot of things, Butch. - [Mr. Gable] Todd Hendricks, wasn't he Trish's boyfriend? - It's none of your fucking business. - Oh that's right, because fucking is your business. - [Bobby Voiceover] You're taking Jesse Manly to prom? - I don't think he'll be up for it, if you know what I mean. (heavy breathing) Chanel, I won't be hurt by your pathetic little lies. - I'm not lying, you stupid bitch! - It's a matter of life or death, Laura. - Everything's life or death with you, BJ. - I've always loved you. - [Trish] Wait a minute, I know exactly what's going on here. - [Laura] Coach Perry? Trish, ew. - [Bobby Voiceover] You can't speak to him. Is that clear? - [Jesse Voiceover] Don't you understand? I think I'm gay. - Come on man, give it to me. - I can't stand you! (muffled screaming) (suspenseful atmosphere music) (dramatic orchestra music) (dramatic atmosphere music) (music intensifies) (music lessens) - Damn it! I lost him. - [Nurse Voiceover] The transformation is almost complete. Soon I'll steal her identity. - Pleased to meet you, I'm Lorraine Manly. How very nice to meet you, my name's mother Manly. Oh father Gable. Remember when you used to call me Lola? Yeah, that's Lorraine, you and Lola. (purrs) (thunder booming) - Just to talk. Just to talk? You wanted to talk to me, so talk to me. - Stupid, stupid. - So what's up? So what's up? What's on your mind? - Where were you? - None of your beeswax, trash. - Get out of my room! - You know it's all gonna catch up with you. - What is? - All of it. Eating like a pig, acting like a pig. Pretty soon you're gonna turn into a pig. And all the lipstick in the world won't do you any good. - Well this has been lovely, but I'm off volunteering again. - You're only pretending to be a goody-two-shoes so that you can get your hands on daddy's inheritance. But trust me, I'm not gonna let that happen. (snorts) - We'll see. And then the monster goes boom boom boom through the... Come back here, you little shit! Where are you, you little shit? This isn't funny! Hey! Blaze? Manda? (screams) (screams) (screams) (extended screaming) - Mama. I have a confession to make. I'm in love, mama. I'm in love. I can't even explain it. Every time I look at her, I feel this... Connection. Like I've known her my entire life. Oh mama, aren't you happy for me, mama? Mama? Mama? Oh mama. Mama. You might think that I'm crazy. But I swear. I could hear you talking to me when I was in juvi. You spoke to me. Telepathically. And you told me... Things, you told me to do things, and I did them. All of them. I'm the man you wanted me to be, mama. I just wish that you could be awake to see it. God, this is no way to live. You don't wanna be like this mama, how could you? You wanna be free. You wanna be free. And I... I want you to be free. I hear you, mama. Oh I hear you. Loud. Loud and clear. - What the hell? What are you doing? - What does it look like I'm doing, you stupid slut? - You won't get away with this. - Watch me. I've already gotten away with everything. - You killed all those football players. - They stood in my way. - You are the Letter Jacket Killer. - And I won't let anybody stand in my way. (screams) (dramatic atmosphere music) Bobby! Need a ride? - I'm really glad you showed up 'cause I didn't think I'd be able to make it all the way home. You see, I was just meeting your brother at the track. Thanks for the ride. (suspenseful atmosphere music) Please! I won't tell anyone! - Nobody is going to stand in my way. (neck snaps) - Laura, it's Bobby! He's dead! - Don't be ridiculous, BJ. Bobby didn't sleep with Trish. - No, I just saw Butch Manly snap his neck like a twig. - (chuckles) BJ, you're exaggerating. Bobby's not that skinny. - His dead body is right out there on the lawn! - Oh dead dead dead! BJ, enough! Butch Manly is the most decent, kind, loving boy this side of the tracks. He wouldn't do that to our Bobby. - [BJ] We have to get out of here. Butch Manly is the Letter Jacket Killer. - You're being ridiculous. - Butch is going to kill us! Come on! - Don't you ever say another bad word about Butch Manly. That's the man I love, and I intend to marry. I've had it up to here with your lies. Hi Butch. - Laura. You scared me. - I'm all ready to go. - What? - If you wanna grab my suitcase for me, I'll get us a couple of beers from the fridge. I know how you boys love beer. - Laura. - What is it, lover? - I came for Trish. Not for you. - No, you love me remember? - No. I don't. - Yes you do. You love me. - No, I really don't. - So what are you saying? - I love Trish. - But we're star-crossed lovers. We're supposed to be together forever. - Laura, I do not want you. At all. (ominous atmosphere music) - You son of a comatose bitch. Is this what you want? What about this? (laughs) What about this? Now do you love me? How about now? (wheezing) Do you love me now? Now do you love me? - Hi. - Butch, what are you doing here? - I brought you something. - What is this? Butch, these are covered in... - Blood. Trish, I'm the killer. The Letter Jacket Killer? Never mind, just take them. - Why are you bringing these to me? - Trish, this is my gift to you. Now it can be just the two of us. Now there's nobody left to stand in our way, nobody left to keep us apart. Now... Now it can just be you. And me. Together. Forever. - Oh. - Oh? Oh what? - I'm very flattered, and it's sweet, but I just don't have feelings for you, that's all. - What? - Yeah. I know a few years ago I lost one of my virginities to you, but I've moved on, Butch. - Let's forget the past Trish, let's make a fresh start. - I can't, Butch. I won't be with you. - Oh. Well that's really not an option anymore. - Father! - Stop! She's your sister! - What? - [Mr. Gable] She's your sister. - Daddy, what are you talking about? Has everyone gone nuts? - [Mr. Gable] Butch, I am your father. - My father's dead. - I'm your real father, Butch. 22 years ago, your mother Lorraine and I had intercourse while your other father was working late at my factory. She used to be such a beauty. The most glorious bosom you've ever seen. Thighs that trembled beneath my touch, lips that glistened as they wrapped around my-- - That's enough, okay, wow. I get it, my mom's hot. - Please forgive me son, I had to do it. When I found you and your sister in the 69 position that night at the drive-in, I knew I had to do something, so I framed you for taking the money, and I'm the reason you went to jail. Please try to understand. I was just trying to protect my family. - Father! Father, wake up! - It's too late for him Trish, but it's not too late for us! (suspenseful atmosphere music) - Not you too Laura! - Come back, my love. She did that to herself actually. I think she had some mental problems. Oh are you serious? Is this really necessary? It's just gonna make things more difficult for you and for me. You see, none of that was necessary. I thought I meant something to you. I thought... That you loved me. You... Tormented me. With the prospect of love. Because of you, I was taken away. Because of you, I had years of my life. Stolen from me. And now I find out that you're my sister. This... This is the only way. - No Butch, it doesn't have to be this way. - You stole my life. Now I have to take yours. (gunshot) (dramatic atmosphere music) - BJ, you saved my life! - Back away, you stupid bitch. - BJ, what's gotten into you? - It's always Trish, Trish, Trish. Trish is a dish, Trish is a dish. You wanna know what I think? Trish is a bitch! Finally paying attention to me. I've been paying attention to everything that's been going on around here. It didn't take me long to figure out that Butch was the killer. All I had to do was stay out of the way while he picked you off one by one. - BJ, what are you saying? - All I have to do is use Butch's knife to kill you and I get away with all of the inheritance. - Oh, this is about daddy's money? I'll split it with you. - I win, Trish! Not you! I win! (music intensifies) - [Narrator] Next time on Hell Town. - [Chanel] Jesse, is that you? - Don't you remember? I'm Jimmy, Jesse's twin brother. - I saw Butch stab my sister, so I shot him. I didn't know what else to do. (sobbing) - [Male Nurse] It's Chanel, she's alive! (suspenseful orchestra music) (dramatic orchestra music) - That glory hole scene was something else wasn't it? It was really one of my favorites. Save that for later. We haven't been able to find anymore episodes of Hell Town. We have dug up many graves in the same cemetery however. We have exhumed over 20 bodies to no avail. But what we have found is another series called Triple A Horror, episodes one, two, and three, which we'll be showing next week. It takes place at a bar called the Side Cock Buffet. Where they serve blood, balls, and burgers. Just don't break down. Shot in Del Rio, Nova Scotia. It's where the Inuits go for a good time. So until next week, my Hellions, this is Debbie Rochon for Twisted Classic Television. (thunder booming) (dramatic atmosphere music)
