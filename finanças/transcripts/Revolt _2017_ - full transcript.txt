Subtitle by Renatinha Tankinha. Let's keep moving! Let's go, come on! Let's go! Go, go, go! Come on! Come on. On my six. Lets go! Move it, go! Come on. come on, Come on! This way, this way! The live is to fight. The fight is to live. And when all is lost, I will be found. Hello! - Shh! Quiet! - Who's there? - Quiet. - Who's there? - Are you locked up, too? - Yes, you need to be quiet. - What are we doing here? - Shut up. You'll get us killed. Please, tell me where we are. The Police Station, you idiot! - Yes I know, where? - In Narok. Where is it? - 200 km from Nairobi. - Are you lost? Nairobi... Where is... where is Nairobi? - Is that a real question? - Yeah. - The capital of Kenya. - East Africa. What am I doing here? You sound American. Yeah, I'm American. You're not sure? I'm... confused. What's your name? I don't know. The men who locked you up probably beat you unconscious. Who are you? I'm a Doctor. I was working at the foreign aid hospital for 2.5 years. The hospital is gone now. So, who's out here fighting? What the hell is happening? They're getting closer. What... What the hell was that? You really don't know? What's the last thing you remember? Pain. Lots of pain. I just... woke up here. I don't know. You don't remember the invasion? - Who's invading? - Not who... what. Why are they doing this? Why here? Why in Kenya? Not just here. Everywhere. What do I gotta do? I'm not gonna die in here. You die in here or out there. No! - Hey!! - Don't do that! Men are worse than machines. - In here. - Machines kill quickly. - Inside! - They'll kill you. And they'll do worse with me. Why don't they hear me? Idiot! I don't speak Gikuyu. I don't speak Gikuyu. He wants to know who you work for and why you are locked up. Americans? - What are you saying? - I'm negotiating. Don't you move! - You came back for me? - Yeah. Of course. Are you okay? My name is Nadia. Nadia. Hi. Look, I still don't know... I'll call you Bo. Bo? We'll find my base, get you safe. Nowhere is safe. - I saw a bomber plane out there. - I saw trucks, I saw men fighting. And so many dying. - What did they do to him? - They're getting foreigners. Nowhere is safe. There's a US Army base north of here. But you'll never make it there. The machines are hunting everyone down. - So we'll avoid populated areas. - Stick to the open road. Behind that red car. That looks OK. - Could be a drop. - Could be. - Cars make noise and might attract them. - Yeah, it might. You said there is a US Base to the north. How far? I don't know. Hundreds of miles or more. Well, we better start driving. - I'm nothing going with you. - You got somewhere else you got to be? No! Doesn't mean that I want to hide out on the road. All you'll find on that base is a lot of dead bodies. Yeah, maybe. We could also find them in a bunker coordinating with the Pentagon. You don't get it. 8 days ago every satellite fell out of the sky. Every one. There is no more Pentagon. There's nothing we can do. Well, I'm not ready to quit. If you had people on that base, you'd do anything you could to get to them. I believe I do. and I want you to help me find them. You're acting like you're on a mission. You're not. Just scared. Yeah, I'm scared. I don't know what I'm doing here, but I know I gotta join this fight. You can do what you want. We're in luck. Engine runs. Axles is in good shape. Just had to change a tire... so... I know how to change a tire, but I still don't know my name. Oh, and I found this in the car. Only picking up static. We just need a better signal. We'll need water and food. I'll check the other cars. Fight! - If you're tired, I'll drive. - I'm fine. You... handle a rifle pretty hell for a... - For a woman? - For a Doctor. I was a medic in the French Army, and... Out here sometimes you have to put down the vaccines and pick up the gun. This region, the world, was living here long before the invasion. and the militia and the military... Get down! - Are you okay? - I'm OK. We're outgunned. Step out very slowly with your hands raised. Kenyan Army. I speak Swahili. Follow my lead. Drop your weapon. Drop it now! Stand! Stand up! Enough of this bullshit. We're speaking English! What did he mean the Dish? What does this symbol mean? The radio station. American. Heavily guarded. Big satellite dish with that symbol. Where is this compound? Through the border. West from the mountains. West of the mountains. Why did your men attack me? Many believe that this machine's American made. What? Or that the Americans use those dishes to call them here. That's a lie! Everything else is destroyed, But those dishes are still standing. Kill me! Please kill me. Do it! What did you say? We need to go. Now! Get on your knees. Move it! The car's shot. That's OK. These guys are giving us their Jeep. You're dehydrated. Drink some water. I can't believe you got out of there. I thought you'd be killed. Those guys were trained soldiers and we were outnumbered back there. You know what? I bet you're a Special Forces or something. Special forces? You clearly have advanced combat skills. And you speak several languages. So, that's where we're going now, the Radar Station? To the border, west, into the mountains. It's big. We'll find it. Find the Americans, find food, shelter... Maybe someone there who knows your name. Is that it? What if it is not safe? Like you said, nowhere is safe. I mean, what if the Kenyans are right? What if the Americans are involved? - That's not possible. - What if it is? We show up at the door, and then what? Then we kill them! Didn't we say we'd avoid towns? Looks like we don't have a choice. Wait, wait, wait, wait stop! It's not good. Could be a power surge. Or something else. The car is shorting out. Go! Go, go! Don't stand there, run! We have to do something. We can get its attention. Daddy! We couldn't help them. Someone's out there. Someone's listening, - No one is listening. - You don't know that. Hello. Hello. Can I get a large Pizza? Actually, make it two large pizzas with everything and extra cheese. My whole family was in Paris. All the big cities was hit first in the heart, so... Truth is I just think how I... lost everyone. Maybe I'm all alone. It sounds easier that way. Maybe I was always the guy with the gun. Maybe I was an asshole. You know... I don't know how to say this. Fighter jets. You see? Someone is out there fighting. We haven't lost yet. - I heard it again. - I don't hear anything. - Oh, I do. - You hear the birds. It's not the birds. We can't keep stopping like this. We gotta go faster. - The car was faster. - Yeah, the car was faster. Do you hear it now? missions have to move in two days now. Look, it's just a tape. We don't know if you can hear or... We have multiple reports of explosions in downtown Nairob. Multiple explosions downtown I tell yous. Ok. Everyone, I was told we have to leave the station. Yes, yes, yes! Yes, yes, OK. We must fight... in these final hours... to refuse whatever we were ever asked to by the United States, Europe, Asia... it is the final days... Right here in Africa, in Kenya in the streets of Nairob... the cradle of civilization may now... may now be humankind's last hope... Kenya, we must come together. We must stand together, we must fight together. Peace be with you Kenya. - You hear that, don't you? - Shut up! But they will kill us, all of us. Hurry, they come, spread! We are all on the same side here. Let us go. Let her go! Come on, come on, come on. Watch out! Keep low. - Why are they doing this? - They're poachers. Look at them. They're hunting. Waiting for their prey and we're bait. Hide! Just don't look. Go! Run. That's one down. Drop your weapon now! Sun glinted off your lens. I thought you were a sniper. I could have shot you. If I was a Sniper, you'd be dead already. Luckily these shots don't kill. - Are you hurt? - No. Hurts when you graze your knee. - I'm dying. - I'm a Doctor. Oh, congratulations, but you're a bit late. - Let me have a look. - No, please. Don't. Seeing the wound the first time was bad enough. If we take this bandages off, I don't think we're gonna get them back on. Do you? It's good to see you both. You are the first people I've seen in days that are actually, breathing, moving around. I was in Kosovo in 1998. I saw terrible things. Kandahar, Congo. Nothing like this. Nothing. So, what were you doing here? Here? My job. When the ships came down, I made a promise to myself.. that I wouldn't stop shooting until the battery died or I did. Ships? The ships pulling people into the sky. Where have you been, under a rock? I got some great shots of the ship landing. You can see this... Oh God! Here, look at this! I was on assignment. 6 weeks doing a story on child soldiers. These kids may have had nothing, but they have all the strength in the world. I traveled with them. As we move toward the city, a storm closed in. I didn't know it then, but they taking over our power grid. Using it. The world started to fall. Everyone fled, but the child soldiers, they pressed forward. Then came the ships. Look! I left the city, as the ground forces moved in. Yeah. So, shot of a lifetime. A child facing down a giant. This is it. This is the human spirit! Tomorrow this picture could rally the resistance. That's why it has to live on. That's why the heavenly father sent you here. - We have to go. - We can't just leave him here. - Yes you can! - No! I won't! Come on! - Drink this! - Don't spill on me. Is that where you're from? That's where we're going. Do you know it? I came that way. Northwest of here across the mountain plateau. - So it's still standing? - Yeah. was a few days ago. We've seen it from a distance, but we've lost it. I took a picture of the dish. I took pictures all the way from that to there, so... If you're a clever little soldier, you could work out where I took each picture. And then backtrack your way there, like digital breadcrumbs. I'll trade you. My camera for a bullet. What? I have seen soldiers bleed out on the field for days. It's not gonna happen. Now, you want my camera And I want to give it you. You can either pry it out of my hands and be off, or you can honor a dying man's last request. - Don't make us do this. - Don't make me beg. I know she won't do it. She's a doctor. She's taken a bloody oath, But you, you're a trained soldier. You only kill people who want to live. Stop talking. Every second you delay, is a second you put her life in danger. You know that, now, come on. You do your job. I'm not gonna shoot you! Doctor. Soldier. Your sole purpose is to heal, his is to harm. And to get out you got to cancel each other out, now don't you? You have to kill me! - And wouldn't someone... - Be quiet! You're useless, aren't you? Aren't you? - Be quiet. - You want me to be quiet? You're gonna have to shut me up. Shut me up, you son of a bitch! Is this what you want? The fight is to live and when all is lost, I have to find it. He took the picture standing right here. He came this way. - Damn it. - What? The battery. Are you kidding? This camera was our only chance of finding the dish, now it's dead. - I told you we would never get there. - We'll get there. Look, we're close. There are only a few pictures left. Goddamnit. Now this... this is an awesome car. It's an American car. - It doesn't look like it will run. - She'll run. Come on. Come on. Get in! When the invasion began, people were saying there were unmanned drones. No pilot inside. Just machines programmed to kill. Drone warfare from god knows where. They must have some weakness. Something we can use against them. We should go. Go! Go! Go, Go, go, go! - Come on. - Come on, go faster. - They are too fast. - Oh, god, there's so many! Go fast, the house. Go for the house! I'm going. Come on. Come on. Hang on! Nadia, here! Come on! Go, go, go, go, go! I got you. No! Look at me. Look at me. I'm out of bullets... I'm out of bullets. Foxtrot this is Bravo One. - Foxtrot, do you copy? - You got... you gotta kill me. You got to kill me. There's no one coming. No one! Please! Someone's coming, somebody's coming. I'm gonna get you help. I'm gonna get you help. - You'll gonna kill me? - You need to be quiet. No one's coming. Please, you gotta do it! Please... Please... Please... To live is to fight. Say it one more time. To live is to fight. To fight is to live. When all is lost, you will be fine. There he is. - We're the ones who found you. - We carried you, you big bastard. - Where am I? - On Day One... Some of the staff members from a nearby medical center set up a triage. - You're safe down here. - Yeah, safe, for now. You have to forgive my friend. He worries too much. What is your name? - And then they took her. - Yeah, that's what they do. They didn't kill her, they... They took her and then they vanished. - We've all lost people here. - I've got to find her. - You can't find her; They have her now. - You don't understand. I didn't know who I was. - and now... - Now she's gone. Look man, the ships, they take people and don't come back. But you are here now with us. So an American soldier wakes up alone. in a jail cell somewhere near Nairobi. Then no memory. Walks god knows how many kilometers to get here. and then the ship comes, they take her friend. So why didn't they take you? We should take him to see Roderick. Roderick! Sorry, I didn't hear. This is the guy we found on the street. Roderick Mburu, Army engineer. You're... it looks like you're building a weapon here. Not just a weapon, an EMP. A high-voltage burst of energy, just like a lightning bolt. We have been running test on smaller devices and just yesterday we got the frequency just right. Now I can calibrate the big girl. The chief is getting her to the right spot. You see, Rod's got this crazy idea to detonate it under a ship. Do some real damage. It's not crazy. The problem is the ships only hover low enough over huge crowds of people. a crowd surrounded by drone. The idea is to put a grenade under a hornet's nest. We've never even gone close. Rod, they didn't take him. - What do you mean? - They took his friend and left him behind. They didn't take you? Roderick, over. Can you hear me? Go. - We need to move fast now. - Every single person. Wait. - The drone didn't take him. - They must have tracked us. Tracked? To live is to fight. To fight is to live. - It's me. - What? I remember. They planted something in me. In my spine. - What are you talking about? - I lead them here. I think they attack some of us to find the rest of us. They always follow me. They follow me and then they killed everyone else. They took Nadia. They are on their way here right now. There's your proof. You never should have brought me here. I've just killed all of you. If the drones followed you here, maybe they'll turn away if I blow your goddam brains off! - Kara, they're already coming. - He brought them here. Don't kill each other, Kara. If you don't kill me, they'll follow me. Let me lead them the way. Well, it's too late for that! You can shoot me or you can let me help. You need me. I am the only one who can get the EMP under the ship. Every day I watch the drones throw out people into this passage over here... and the ships just take them away. Beneath the station there is a network of service tunnels. That’s our best shot. And the closest endpoint is the tunnel over here. So we've got to get the EMP across town, through the tunnels, - and then under the drones. - And under the ship. Then what happens? Well, I do not know how they work, but I do know Electromagnetism. And once the EMP blasts off, the ships and the drone are gonna fall. What happens to the people inside the ships? Look, the people that we can save are the ones on the ground, now. America off the map. China, Europe, all of it's gone. For all we know, we're the last ones left. Though, we have to do this, for everyone. Let's go, guys. Come on guys, come on! We don't have much time. Come on. Alright. Here are the magnetic grenades. here. Shoulder-fired rockets. Real stealthy. Jealous? Alright, guys. This is my baby, OK? So I'm gonna make sure she delivers. Just in case I am not the one hitting the fuze, listen up. The four power packs, they go over here. To detonate, we first hit the primal switch, - Then the kill switch. - Primal switch, kill switch, let's go! It's here, it's here. Let's go. - Everybody got out of this level. - Move. Get back to the main camp! We're leaving this area now. Come on guys. Let's go, let's go, let's go! That is not our exit. Let's keep going. Come on! Kara? There's more to come, come on! Go, go! No, we took you. - Get out of here. - No, we'll carry you. Give me your grenade! All! - I promised I was going to take you back. - No! - You must never look back. - You have 3 seconds after you pull the pin. Go! Roderick, Come on. Let's go. Wait.Wait. Wait. So many people. The blast radius is 100 meters. It get to detonate directly underneath the ship... But these people will be taken. Got to get it just right. We got to get these people out of here. See, those drones form a cage. We gotta open the door. Make the grenade count. Last one. To live is to fight. Everyone's out. Come on, guys. Let's go, let's go! They're coming. They're coming. Come on. Come on., get out of here. Let's go! Move! You got it! Come on! Over here, Roderick. They’re coming through the vents. Come on. Come on. The battery has damaged.. It's not gonna work. - Look at me. Look at me. - I'm out of bullets. Foxtrot Foxtrot Bravo One. We have to evacuate everything. - There's no one coming. - You sound American. - Please. - I'm not gonna die in here. So shoot me. - To live is to fight. - There's no more time. To live is to fight. To fight is to live. And when all is lost, I will be found. - What am I doing here? - You sound American. - American. - You're not sure? - I am confused. - What's your name? - I don't know. - You come back for me? My name is Nadia. Nadia? OK, Mister I don't know, I'll call you Bo. Bo? It worked. It worked. Are you okay? Washington. What? Washington. 337 Washington Boulevard. That's where I learned to ride a bike. That's where I grew up. Okay, okay, soldier. So what's your name? Bo. I'm going with Bo. Subtitle by Renatinha Tankinha. Improved by Clog.
