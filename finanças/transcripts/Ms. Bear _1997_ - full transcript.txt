(whooshing) (somber music) (pleasant music) (pleasant chiming music) (water flowing) (birds chirping) (owl hooting) (upbeat music) (grunting) (ominous music) (whimpering) (dramatic music) (chainsaw cranking) (chainsaw buzzing) (growling) (chainsaw buzzing) (suspenseful music) (growling) (dramatic music) (roaring) (crying) (moaning) (whimpering) (water flowing) (pleasant music) (ominous music) (dog whimpering) (gun clicking) (somber music) (suspenseful music) (booming) (roaring) (dramatic music) (moaning) (whimpering) (dog barking) (whimpering) - Get the cub! Get the cub! (dog barking) (suspenseful music) (ominous music) (whimpering) (dog barking) (suspenseful music) (splashing) (dramatic music) That a boy, Benny, come on. (whimpering) - I want it back, give it to me! I hate you! I want it back! Give it to me now! Give it! - Yes. Right. - Give it! - Melissa, give her the puppet already. (laughing) - Not fair. She never shares anything. - Thank you. Bye. - What was that all about? - That was Mrs. Penny, Emily's teacher. Pumpkin, is there something you forgot to bring us from school? - No. - You sure you didn't forget anything? Like a report card, maybe? - If you got your report card, why didn't you show us? - Apparently it's been in her desk at school all week. - She probably failed everything. - Melissa. - I asked you a few days ago if you got your report card and you told me no. Why did you lie to me, Emily? - You are the liar. - Excuse me? - You keep promising to take me places, but you never do because you're working. That makes you the liar. - That does not make me a liar and you don't talk to me like that, young lady. - Greg. - I hate this place. I want to go back to California where my friends are. - Me too. What is so great about Abbottsburg? - This town is our home now and I don't wanna hear another word about it. - Emily, stay were we can see you, please. (somber music) (honking) - So dad, what's the deal with this guy? He some kind of poacher or something? - Schroeder? Nah. No, he's all right. He's doing these animals a favor. The bear problem getting worse all the time, most people just want to shoot them on sight anyway. Stay in the truck, all right? (silly music) (chuckling) (ominous music) - Hello Porter. - Schroeder. - How you doing their? - Good, how are you? Have a look at what I brought for you. (moaning) - Beautiful. (laughing) Very good. Very good. We'll take this right off you. (bear moaning) Come out here. (machinery humming) Here you go. This could be the beginning of a beautiful relationship, Porter. Get the cub. The little ones are worth more than the big ones. Now this one isn't going out until next week. You nab a cub by then and I'll pay you double. - Shouldn't be too hard. Poor thing will probably be hanging around the same area for weeks looking for its mother. I can get it. - Good. Okay. Talk to you next week. - All right. - What do you wanna do? "I want to go back to California "where my friends are." (bear cub moaning) Did you hear that? (bear cub whimpering) (somber music) Hello? (cub whimpering) Why are you crying? Are you sad? (cub crying) Wait! I won't hurt you. - [Mother] Emily, come on inside. - Coming. (upbeat music) (clock ticking) (rustling) (bear cub whimpering) (pleasant music) (whimsical music) Hi! (bear cub whimpering) Wait! (ominous music) (water trickling) (barking) - Okay, bye girls. Be good, please. And no fighting. - We won't be gone long. (pleasant music) - Here Ms. Bear, I got some yummy chicken for you. (bear cub grunting) Where are you? (bear cub whimpering) Your hand's got an owwy. Do you wanna see the doctor? (pleasant music) Don't worry, Ms. Bear, I'm a very good doctor. - Come on, Emily, I'm gonna make some popcorn. Did you hear what I said? Popcorn. What's the matter with you? You sick or something? (whimsical music) (bear grunting) What're you doing, Emily? - I'm taking her temperature. Can you read this for me? (grunting) - I don't believe it's a real live bear. - Her hand is hurt badly. - How did you get it in here? - I carried her upstairs. She needs our help. - Emily, we have to get it out of the house, it could be dangerous! - No! She's a friendly bear. I want to keep her. - You can't keep a bear. It's not a pet. Besides, dad hates animals. Hates them. He won't even let a cat or dog in the house. If he finds out we've got a bear stashed up here, we're gonna be grounded for the rest of our lives. - Please. Make the bear better. (bear grunting) - This is nuts. I wander where her mother is. She must be worried sick about her. (garage door humming) Oh no. We're dead! (somber music) I can't believe you got me involved in this, Emily. - I don't hear any fighting. - What are you doing? - Hiding your stupid bear in the closet. Not a word about this to mom or dad, you got that? - Okay. (cooing) - Where's the fire? - I'm going to get indigestion watching you girls. Didn't you two have lunch today? - Must be your terrific cooking. - Yeah. Ready for dessert? - Can I be excused, please? - Okay. - They're up to something. - As long as they're playing nicely. (bear snoring) - [Emily] I don't believe it's sleeping. - Uh oh. What do we do now? - Take it back to the woods before it gets dark. - We can't take her while she's still asleep. She'll wake up all alone and get scared. - Look, Emily, I'm not getting grounded over this. It's your fault that we're in this stupid mess. - You're the stupid! (knocking) - Hello. What are you guys doing? - Just playing. - I want you two to know I'm very happy you're finally getting on well. Tomorrow's a school day, so let's start getting ready for bed. - She's my bear and I want her to have a good night sleep before she leaves. - Fine. It's your funeral. But if dad finds out about this, I'm denying all knowledge of it. (somber music) - Good night, Ms. Bear. (thumping) (grunting) (pleasant music) (thunder rumbling) (screaming) (whimpering) - Emily! It's okay, baby. It's just a storm. Do you want to come sleep in my bed? Okay. If you change your mind, just come in. Goodnight pumpkin. (somber music) - Psst, Ms. Bear. Come out now. (pleasant music) It's okay, it's just a storm. (whimpering) You can sleep in my bed if you want. (grunting) (pleasant music) - Emily. (bear grunting) (screaming) - Uh oh. - Get out of here! Get out of here! Come on! Come on! Get out of my house Come on! Come on! Get out! Get out of here! - Sarah? - Come on! Get out of my house! Come on! - Good God! - It ate Emily! - Mom! No, stop! She's my friend. (bear moaning) - Emily. - What is a bear doing in the house? - I found her in the woods. She was hurt. - Well get away from it. It might have rabies. - No, she's a friendly bear. - Friend? Are you nuts? It's a wild animal. Get away before it bites you. - Honey, has your friend got a name? - Yes. - Want to tell us what it is? (bear grunting) - Masha. - It's just a baby. - It's a bear, Sarah. - Maybe it's an orphan. - It's a bear, Sarah. It might look cute now. One day it's gonna grow up, it's gonna be a monster. - I want to keep her. - No, you're not keeping it. I'm gonna take it with me to the office, I'm gonna call the conservations service and they will come and pick it up. - I'm sorry, honey, but your father's right. We can't keep a bear in the house. (somber music) (giggling) - Here, Masha, come swing with me. (pleasant music) Good girl. (giggling) Do you wanna go on the teeter-totter? - Have you seen how happy your daughter is? Maybe we should let her keep it for a few days. Might help get her out from the slump she's been in. - You can't be serious. Anyway, the longer it stays, the harder it's gonna be for Emily to say goodbye. Better nip this thing in the bud right away. (somber music) (giggling) - Don't go up the tree. (pleasant music) - Let's go, please, we're late. - Come on, it's okay. My dad's just driving us to school. - Come. Come on. - Come on, Masha. - You see what I'm talking about with these things? (pleasant music) Bye, Sarah. - Bye. (school bell ringing) - Simon says, do this. (laughing) Simon says, do this. (laughing) Simon says do this. (laughing) - Dad, don't you think the bear's a good thing for Emily? - Oh, not you too. - She hasn't been this happy since we left California. - I'm sorry, but the bear is going. - This is how you wave goodbye. Like this. Can you do it? (Emily giggling) - Bye, dad. - Bye, sweetie. Honey, come out the front door. I don't want the bear to get out. - Bye, Masha. - Can't we keep her, dad? What if they use her for animal testing or something? - Honey, she'll be fine. But I'll tell you what we can do. - What? - I'll make sure the conservation service tells us where they take Masha and we can visit her any time we want. - Okay. - Good girl. Now I know it's hard, but it's time to say goodbye. - Goodbye, Masha. I have to go to school now. (somber music) - Bye, sweetie. You girls have a good day. (car engine starting) (dramatic music) - Come on. Wave. She didn't wave. - She'll be fine. Come on. (bear cooing) - Sorry, girl, I can't take you in. You'll have to wait in the car. (bear whimpering) (cloth tearing) Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! Stop that! Stop! Stop it! - Good morning, Mr. Bradley. - Hi. (office commotion) - Good morning, Greg. You've got a meeting in five minutes-- - Joyce, could you give me a few minutes alone? And could you get me the conservation service on the line right away? (bear cooing) Good girl, Masha. (bear whimpering) Quiet. (pleasant music) Oh. You miss her, huh? Don't worry, you'll see her again, I promise. (phone beeping) - [Joyce] Greg, I have a conservation officer on the line for you. - Thank you, Joyce. Hi, conservation service. This is Greg Bradley. I have a little surprise for you guys. My daughter found a bear cub in our backyard. (somber music) (spitting) (somber music) - Hi, I'm Greg Bradley. - Barney Porter, how you doing? (bear whimpering) - Considering I have a little wild life in my office. (bear whimpering) You wanna come up? Come on, I'll show you where it is. (cooing) (doorknob rattling) (office commotion) (bear whimpering) You have to be discreet about getting her out of here. They have a strict policy about animals in the building. - Not a problem. - Come on. Masha. - Something wrong? - I locked her in here. She couldn't have gotten out that way. Those are locked tight. - She's obviously not in here. I guess we better check the rest of the building. - Oh my God. Joyce, have you noticed anything unusual? - Unusual like what? - You know, out of the ordinary. - Out of the ordinary? - Like a bear. - A little bear. - A bear? (rustling) (silly music) (bear groaning) (thudding) (silly music) (upbeat music) (cooing) (yelling) - It's a bear! It's a bear! (screaming) - Bear? (woman screaming) (screaming) - Where'd it go? (exciting music) - Wait a minute, will you? (banging) (silly music) (upbeat music) - Huh? - Masha? - May I help you? That's my truck you're sitting in. - She's a beauty. Wish I could afford a set of wheels like this. Conservation officers make good money, do they? - What's your business? - John Harper, bailiff. - The bank send you? - Yes, sir. They say you owe them a bit or money, so I thought I'd borrow the truck for while until we get this thing sorted out, as they say. - I'm a little behind the mortgage. But it's no big deal. - Tell that to the bank. In the mean time, I've got the seizure papers right here. (sighing) - That's half of what I owe them. I'll have the other half next week. - Next week, no later or I take the truck. - Hi, hon. - Hi, honey. - What's up with Emily? - She's upset about Masha. I told her what happened at work. - I have good news for her. Emily, guess who stopped by today. - Masha? - Yeah. (laughing) - Emily? Come inside for dinner, honey. - I'm waiting for Masha. - I know but she may not come back right away and your dinner's getting cold. Now, please. You can come back outside after you finish eating. - Okay. - How come we're stopping here? - Well this is the guy that found the cub. I'll be right back. - Wanna play war? - Sure, let's play. (somber music) - How you doing? - What now? You didn't get me in enough trouble today? - Sorry, I don't mean to disturb you. Just wanted to know if you've seen the cub because chances are he'll come back here to get fed. - Well, actually my wife said she... (pleasant music) Are those your boys out there in the truck? - Yeah. Your wife was saying? - My wife said she'd like to invite you in for a cup of coffee. - Okay. - What about your boys? - They'll be all right. - Sarah, this is Barney Porter, the conservation officer I told you about. - Oh, hi. - How do you do? - He's accepted your invitation for coffee. - My what? - Your invitation for coffee and this is Melissa. - Hi. - And Emily. - [Barney] Hi girls. - I have another chore for you guys. - What? - Don't worry, it's a fun one. - Yeah, sure. (chuckling) - Have a seat. - Thanks. - Don't say anything but I just saw Masha out front. - Yay! I knew she'd come back. (shushing) - This is the maniac that terrorized her today and his two boys are outside. So I'll keep him distracted in the kitchen. Melissa, you go talk to the boys. Emily, see if you can get Masha in the backyard without them seeing. - Yay! - Very cool, dad. (pleasant music) (somber music) Hi. - Hi. I didn't know you lived here. Your name is Melissa, right? - How did you know? - Everybody knows who you are. You're the new kid in town. (somber music) - Masha, come here! Masha! (cooing) Masha! Masha! Masha! - You found the cub, huh? - Actually, my sister found her in the woods. (cooing) - Welcome home. (Emily giggling) (ominous music) - So, do you wanna go out sometime? - No, I'm very busy with school work. I don't have time to date. - Ah, come on. Everybody has time to date. - Pat, I found the cub. - Get out. - I found it, I swear. Come on, I'll show you. - Okay. Let's see. - Thanks. - I read in the paper about the bear problem in this town. - Yeah, they've become quite a nuisance since they've started logging. But what can you expect? You chop down their habitat, they've got no choice but to come town looking for food. - Gee, I wonder if that means the mother might come to our house looking for the cub. - No, I doubt that. I think your cub's probably an orphan. This town's gotten to be like the O.K. Corral lately. People are just so fed up with bears, they just wanna shoot them now. (chuckling) Some have even been shot by conservation officers. - What would you do with a cub if you found it? - Relocated it to some place safe. - Masha. I got to see you again. - Holy smokes. - Told you I found it. - Look, you guys, you have to promise you won't tell your dad, okay? - Are you kidding? He's been looking all over for this thing. - She's my bear and I'm keeping her. - You can't keep a bear. It's against the law. - I'll make a deal with you. We won't tell my father if you go out on a date with me. - What? - Give me a break. If you get a date, what do I get? - Well, you can have my baseball glove. Okay? One date. That's all. I promise you'll have a good time, okay? - Okay, one date, that's it. - And all of you have to make a secret pact and swear not to tell. - No problem. (giggling) - Patrick! Eldridge! (ominous music) - Hey, dad. Leaving so early? - Yeah, let's go. - Well, she's hungry as a bear. It's a joke. (giggling) - Where is she going to sleep? - Out in the yard. (Masha moaning) - No, I want her to sleep with me. - No, she's going to stay out in the yard and only then until we find her mother. - No, I want her to sleep with me! - Forget about it. She's not sleeping in the house and that's final. (snoring) (upbeat music) - I'm afraid you have too many books here. You'll have to put some back. - But these are my first books I've ever taken out and I need them for my bear. - Now you're only allowed to check out seven books at a time. - I'll take them out. It's really my bear. My dad found it first. - No it's not, it's my bear. - No, it's mine. - No it's not you poo-poo! (tropical music) - [TV Announcer] Aline and Annika will do their hands either to the side or across their chest and, again, slowly curl in. You've got lots of adaptations here. If your head and neck get tired, you just drop the head back. (Eldridge spitting) (phone ringing) - Hello? Hi, hun. Yeah. It's okay. Oh, that's a wonderful idea. Then you're taking the day off? Okay. Good. Okay. Bye. (water running) (silly music) (cafeteria commotion) - Mind if I join you? - Sure. - So how about we go on our date this weekend? You free? - I guess. - Super. (school bell ringing) - Hi, mom. Where's dad? - Your father decided to take the day off. He's working on a surprise for you guys. - What kind of surprise? - You'll see when we get home. (somber music) (tools buzzing) (hammer thumping) - Oh wow. - What're you making, daddy? - Masha's new home. - Yay! (upbeat music) * Later on this afternoon * You can come to my place after school * * There's something I will need your help to make * * A recipe for friends to bake * It's a special kind of chocolate cake * * Or anything we want to we can do * * Yes I am * Especially * Glad that you are helping me * Good friends add to the recipe * * For cooking up some fun - Masha! We need the milk. (upbeat music) * Let's add raisins to our treat * * Chocolate chips to make it sweet * * We'll wash our hands before we eat * * We're cooking up some fun * Yes I am * Especially * Glad that you are helping me * Friends add to the recipe * We're cooking up some fun (hammer thumping) - Greg, the kids are going to bed now. - Goodnight, dad. - Goodnight, daddy! - [Greg] Goodnight, girls. - Don't forget your dinner, Greg. (hammer thumping) - The survival of the cub depends completely on the skill of the mother in teaching it the basics of what to eat, where and how to get it and how to deal with danger. - I think I should be Masha's mom until her own mom comes back. - That's a great idea. I'm so proud of how responsible you've gotten. (phone ringing) - I'll get it. Hello? - Who is it? - It's your buddy, Schroeder. - Hey, Schroeder. - [Schroeder] Where's that cub, Porter? - I'm working on it. - Better get that little beast down here. I've got a definite order for a cub. That animal is money in the bank. - I've got a pretty good idea where to find it. It's just a matter of time. - You don't have time. I need her on that plane Sunday night, got it? - I'll call you. What? - He wants the cub? - Keep checking with those Bradley girls. Okay? - Okay. - Emily. Emily, wake up. Wake up. (pleasant music) (gasping) (giggling) (whimsical music) - Look at Masha. (girls giggling) - Your father was up all night working on it. - Great job, dad. (flower pot shattering) (laughing) (silly music) - Hey, squirt, ready to go? She's reading about bears. - I'm gonna be Masha's mother until her real mom comes back. - Great. Then we can be her grandparents. (water flowing) - I see one. - Where? - Over there. Right by the log. - I see it. - It's a trout. A big one too. - Okay, mom, go ahead. - Where's Masha? (Masha cooing) - Oh, there she is. - Masha, come here. We're teaching you how to fish. Come on, there's a big yummy fish over there. (cooing) What's the matter with you? Do you wanna starve to death? (cooing) Look, this is what you have to do. All you have to do is walk into the water and grab the fish. Just like in the picture. (cooing) I guess she doesn't like fishing. (somber music) - So, tomorrow's the big day. Can I pick you up at six? - I don't know. - What do you mean? I thought we had a deal. - Isn't this kinda like a date? - This? A date is when you go somewhere special. - [Emily] Hey, come here you guys. - [Patrick] Besides, the first date shouldn't be after school. - What is it? - Look what Masha found. (ominous music) - [Eldridge] They're bear tracks. - Maybe it's her mother. - Nah, those can't be her mother's footprints. - How do you know? - Because. - Eldridge. Don't talk about stuff you don't know about, okay? (Masha cooing) - Uh oh. She wants to follow them. (exciting music) I don't know if this is a good idea, you guys. Aren't big bears dangerous? - But what if it's her mother? - If we do see a bear, just don't let her do anything to scare it and we should be fine. - [Melissa] Easy for you to say. (exciting music) (Masha grunting) - Don't worry, Emily. Stay right here, okay? (Masha whimpering) - Is that her mother? - I don't know. (dramatic music) - It's dead. - Is it her mother? - I don't know, Emily. - Looks like it's been shot. Don't worry. It's not her mom. - How do you know? - Because it's not. - But how can you be so sure? - That's a black bear. Masha is a cinnamon bear. - But they're both brown. - They change their fur color all the time. You can only tell the difference by their facial features. That bear is not Masha's mother. - You hear that, Emily? It's not her mom, okay? Come on, Masha. It's time to go home. (somber music) (alarm ringing) (upbeat music) * Good morning, it looks like a beautiful day * * Let's start with some tea * In our usual way * Stories to tell or a new song to sing * * Before we put on our favorite things * * And isn't it grand * I hope it never ends * We have the whole day * And we've very best friends * Now don't I look nice * And the same goes for you * Nothing important that we have to do * * So try on this hat * Is the color all right * Should I wear one bracelet or two * * Isn't it grand * I hope it never ends * We have the whole day * And we're very best friends * Oh isn't it grand * I hope it never ends * We have the whole day * And we're very best friends - Hi, Mrs. Bradley. - Hi, Patrick, come in. - These are for you, ma'am. - Aw, isn't that sweet? Thanks. - It's no problem. - Hey, I'm ready. - Hey, gorgeous. - Oh, bye the way, we're double dating. - Oh yeah? With who? - Who do you think? - Come Masha. Come on, Masha. - The bear? - Bye, mommy. - Have a good time. - Aw, come on Melissa, not the bear. I don't even think bears are allowed to play miniature golf. - Thank you for taking out all of my girls. - Yeah. No problem. See you later. - Bye. (upbeat music) (upbeat music) - So where's your mom from? - Germany. - Oh, that's cool. You look really great tonight. I didn't expect you to get so dressed up. - So, was that really Masha's mom today or were you just saying that for Emily's sake? - It wasn't Masha's mother. - How can you be so sure? I mean, you didn't even see the bear's face. - Because I know where Masha's mother is. - What? You know where Masha's mother is? - Yeah, but you can't tell Emily. The bear's being taken away in a couple of days and then she's gonna be gone for good. - Where is she now? - I can't tell you that. My dad would kill me. Not to mention, he'd never let me use his truck again. - I wanna see her, Patrick, where is she? - I can't do it. It's impossible. (somber music) - The date's over. Take me home. Come on, we're going. (somber music) (Masha cooing) - Bye, Patrick. - See you later, Emily. Goodnight, Masha. (grunting) - Come on, Masha. - Bye. - You gotta swear you won't tell a soul. - Okay, I swear. - No, I mean, really swear. Like cross your heart and swear to die. - Okay. I cross my heart and swear to die. I won't tell anyone. (ominous music) (dramatic music) (bear whimpering) It's so cruel. How could you do it? - I didn't do it. Anyway, my dad says it's a good thing for the bears. The people around here are just shooting them like ducks. Just like that bear we found in the woods. - That doesn't make it right. They're entitled to be free just like anyone else. - You're not gonna tell anyone about this, are you? I mean, you did cross your heart on it. (somber music) (snoring) (pleasant music) - Hey, mom. - Hmm? - Can I borrow the car? - The car? Can I ask what for? - I want to take Mash and Emily for a ride. - Okay. Don't go too far, please. - Okay. (buzzing) - Good girl, Masha. Where are we going? - We're gonna take Masha to say goodbye to her mother. - You found her? - Emily, we're not supposed to know. We could get into big trouble for going there. It might night be a good idea for you to come. I can take Masha by myself if you don't wanna risk getting in trouble, okay? No way, Jose, I'm coming. - Okay. Let's go. - Is this where her mother is? - Yeah. You and Masha wait here, okay? (suspenseful music) (buzzing) Okay, come on. (somber music) (grunting) - Come on, Masha. (moaning) (exciting music) (pleasant music) (cooing) - We have to get her mom out of here. (ominous music) (car door slamming) - Oh God. - [Both] Come on, Masha, come on. Come on! (ominous music) (moaning) (foreboding music) - Let's go! Come on, let's go! - Hey! (suspenseful music) (moaning) (phone ringing) - Hello? - Idiot. Who did you tell about the beast? - What's your problem, Schroeder? - My problem is that I just had two kids break into the warehouse with our cub. - What? What two kids? - I don't know who they were, they got away. It was two girls. - And they had the cub? - Yes. Looks like they were trying to have a family reunion. You better take care of this because I tell you right now, if there's any problems, you're the first one to go down. - Don't worry about it. I'll handle it. - And get that cub down here. You only have one day left to cash in. - Hey, boys. Can I talk to you for a minute? I just got a call from Schroeder. He says he saw two girls over at the warehouse and they had the cub. Do either of you know anything about that? - That must've been Melissa and Emily. They took the cub. - You knew about this, Pat? And you told them where the mother was? - I only told Melissa and I made her swear not to tell anybody else. - I can't even trust you? Where's the cub now, with the girls? - Yes, sir. I'm ashamed of you, dad. - What was that? - You're supposed to be protecting these animals. Not selling them. - You keep your mouth shut, Patrick. I'm doing this for you boys. So I can put a roof over your heads so you can have what everybody else has. (somber music) (foreboding music) (knocking) Now we can do this the easy way or we can do this the hard way. (ominous music) - That's a choice you'll have to make. - Hi, Greg. Are you aware you're in violation of a federal law here? It's illegal to keep a bear in captivity. - Get off my property, Porter. - Let's not make this ugly, Greg. Just give me the cub. - Forget it. (sinister music) Hey! (bear whimpering) (suspenseful music) Why don't you leave her alone? She's just a baby. (ominous music) - Out of my way, Greg. - No. (intense music) (moaning) - Greg! - I'm sorry, I didn't mean to do that. (somber music) - Hi, Barney. (car engine starting) (ominous music) (police siren alarming) - We better get the bear. - Hey, Barney, you okay? - Yeah. - Okay, girls, time to say goodbye. (Masha cooing) - Bye, baby. (whimpering) - Goodbye, Ms. Bear. You have to go back to the woods now. (clicking) Go, Masha. (whimpering) - Let's go. (suspenseful music) - Bye, baby. Take care of yourself. - Go, Masha! (growling) - Where's the cub? - I don't know. Your last little visit scared her off. - I want him arrested. (ominous music) - [Officer] Put your hands behind your back, please. - Mom. - You're under arrest, sir, for the unlicensed possession of a dangerous animal and for assaulting an officer. (handcuffs cranking) - Leave my daddy alone! - Can't we resolve this some other way? - No ma'am, we can not. (suspenseful music) - Get out of our tree house! Doesn't he need a warrant or something for that? - Only on television, little lady. Come on. (suspenseful music) - Hey, you can't take my daddy! - It's okay, Emily. (whimpering) - No, Masha, go back! (moaning) Run Masha! (puffing) (ominous music) Masha! (whimpering) (dramatic music) Please don't take her. - I'm sorry. This is really the best thing for her. It's against the law for you to keep her and she wouldn't survive in the woods all by herself. (somber music) Don't worry, she'll be well taken care of. - Take care of your sister. I'm going to see if I can bail out your father, okay? - Come on. - You're awake, aye? (whimpering) Don't worry. Tomorrow you'll be on your way to a new home where you'll be treated like a little princess. (whimpering) I'm sorry, I think your mom's going to a different home. But then again, being a bear, it's not like your mom knows you forever anyway. Patrick's mom, he lost her when he was just a little one too. (car whooshing) - You almost didn't make it, Porter. Bears are going out tonight. Found a new market. Pays a lot of money. So keep in touch, huh? - Yeah, wha's that? - Bear paws. - Bear paws? You can't be serious. - Big underground market for it overseas. - That means killing the bears. - Well. - Hold on. Killing bears had nothing to do with this deal. You said they were going to safe homes. - Just take the money and shut up, Porter, huh? See you around. Let's go. (car engines starting) (dramatic music) (phone ringing) - Hello? - Patrick, it's Melissa. - Hi. Guess my dad was over there, huh? - Can you get your dad's truck? (suspenseful music) Quiet, you guys. This way. (bear whimpering) - No way. (grunting) - Hi. (moaning) - How're we gonna get her back to the truck? - I don't know. Do you know how to drive one of those? - No. - Come on, you guys. Let's see if we can figure this out. - Be careful. - [Eldridge] There's gotta be a key. - Or a starter or something. - Here we go. (foreboding music) It won't start. (ominous music) - What is this? What're you kids doing there? What do you think you're doing? - We're taking the bear back. - Oh. You're taking the bear back, huh? Well I don't think so. - I do. - Get away from that cage! (intense music) Are you out of your mind? (grunting) (growling) - Get him Mama Bear! (suspenseful music) (grunting) - Oh, Porter, it's good that you're here. You better clean up this mess. The bear's loose and your kids are in trouble. - You're in trouble, Schroeder. - What do you mean? - Well we can do this the easy way or we can do this the hard way. (police sirens alarming) (pleasant music) - Porter! Still here? (snoring) (silly music) - Get them out of there. When they wake, you put them under arrest. (somber music) (grunting) Porter? The kids okay? - Yeah. - We're taking Schroeder and his pal into custody. - Sergeant, on behalf of the BC Conservation services, I would like to press charges against one more poacher. - You? (bears grunting) Barney, you got two boys need looking after. - This whole thing is my doing and I should never let-- - Go home, Porter. We'll talk about it in the morning. (somber music) (birds chirping) (pleasant music) (knocking) - We're here! (bears grunting) - Come on, dad. (bears grunting) (pleasant music) (growling) (moaning) - You too, Ms. Bear. (whimsical music) - Goodbye, Masha. (roaring) - Goodbye, Masha. (roaring) Go, Masha. (cooing) (moaning) (pleasant music) (moaning) (cooing) Goodbye.
