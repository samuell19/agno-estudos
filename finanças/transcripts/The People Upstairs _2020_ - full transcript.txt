I didn't hear you come in. How was your day? All right. Long... Tests today. Didn't you get my WhatsApp? I sent you a text. My battery ran out. What did you want? We need some wine. Why? What's all this? All this? Some bites to eat. - Bites to eat? - Yes. Bites to eat... Are we expecting anyone? - Our neighbors. - Our neighbors? Yes. I told you yesterday. Don't you remember? Perfectly, yes. You said you wanted to invite them over, not that you already had. There's a significant difference in the verb tense, Anita. Is that so? The verb tense makes a big difference? Yes, Ana, it does. Someday I'm going to record you so you can hear yourself, Julio. I'm sorry. I'm tired and I've still got 50 tests to correct. Just call and say we'll get together some other time. It's too late. You're always coming up with some excuse. We've owed them an invitation for six months now. Why do we have to have them over? Who says so? Where is it written? Nowhere. Relax. No need to get upset. I'm not upset. You know why, dear? I have no idea. They helped us during the works on the house. We promised we'd show them the apartment, and have them over for a meal when it was done, and that was six months ago, okay? They seem friendly, don't they? - They're boring. They always say hello. - They're bor... They're boring, they always say hello? You know what I mean, you always have to stop, talk to them... They ask how everything is going... That's what normal people do: showing some interest in other living beings. - You know what bothers me? - What, Julio? I live here too. In case you'd forgot. Of course I remember. If you want to have people over, you could at least ask me, couldn't you? No, I don't think so. You know why? - Why, darling? - You'd say no. You always do whenever I suggest anything. - Ana. - Yes... What is this? That's a rug. You bought it because we're having guests? No, because the other one was old. No, because the neighbors are coming over. - Do you like it? - That depends. - Do you like it, Julio? - That depends on what it cost you. Why don't you leave, come back and we'll start over? - Sure, let's do that. - Good. Hello, dear! How it's going? How are you? How was your day? Wow, what's all this? Oh, I remember perfectly that you said you wanted to invite our neighbors over, not that you had already invited them. The verb tense makes a difference. A big difference, right, Ana? - We ought to get some curtains. - I don't like curtains. I don't like that the neighbors can see us. Julio... Can we agree to try to stay in a good mood, just for today? Yes, of course. The first thing I'll do is thank them for every time they hold the elevator door open. And that time they lent us a hammer. It was a hammer, wasn't it? Yes, it was a hammer! And you can be sure I'll try to get them to leave fast so you can run up to the rooftop with your friend, the telescope. I like looking at the stars, Ana. What you don't like is being at home. Today's Friday. We shouldn't be arguing today. You know why I go up to the rooftop? Why, my love? So I can smoke, among other things. I'm not allowed to in the house, in case the rug gets dirty. We do it for your daughter. She has asthma! That's right, we have a daughter. I forgot. Did you have to buy the most expensive ham? Couldn't we have regular snacks? Chips? Peanuts? No, I'm not a cheapskate like you. We're going to end up arguing. Ana. What? Speaking of our daughter and her future mental health, I guess you won't mind if I bring up that problem with them. - Julio, we've already discussed it. - Discussed what, dear? That we wouldn't mention it! But our daughter is suffering. It could end up causing her psychological harm and she could turn into a porno actress. Or worse! A nun! Can we talk about it some other time? I think it's the perfect time to bring it up. We'll tell them between nibbles of this excellent ham. We almost did once in the elevator, remember? I do. I also remember that we decided not to. Because we thought it couldn't get any worse. Just last Saturday the paintings were shaking on the walls. Yes, they were. Julio, please. We'll have a few laughs, you'll see. They're super friendly, right? Julio! You're about to say something important. We all have to make an effort to get along... Yeah, right. And? And to accept others even if it's hard sometimes. Go on, I'm listening. We need to be more tolerant with our neighbors, partners... - Otherwise... - You know what, Ana? You watch too many soap operas. Is this blackmail? You're blackmailing me because you know it upsets me. Listen... If they blasted their music at full volume at 4 AM, and woke us up, wouldn't you talk to them? This is no different. Is it a threat? You'll tell them if they come? Is that shirt new? Yes, it is. Very pretty. It matches the rug. Did you get it at the same shop? At the one next door. It looked good on me. It does. Shirts really suit you. You could tell me once in a while... You look very nice. I know. Thanks. Why don't we open a bottle of wine and start over? That would do us good, yes. But first call the neighbors and tell them not to come. - You know what I think about all this? - What? Deep down, we envy them. - Who? - Our neighbors. Our neighbors? Why? Every time I hear her moaning as they make love, when she screams like a cat as she's about to come, that's what I feel, envy. That's why I don't want to talk to them. I'm glad somebody still has such a good time. Great! So now we're jealous of our Neanderthal neighbors. Fantastic! What about your daughter? You're the one who's worried about her. Shall we give her earplugs to sleep? What should we do when she wakes up scared because the ceiling is shaking, but she doesn't dare to come in our bedroom because she thinks you're the one shouting and I'm the one jumping like a gorilla? What should we do? It's harder than you think to have a good orgasm. If she has them, let her enjoy them. Now I really do need a drink. All right, have a drink, go on! You men don't understand, but that's the way it is! It's not that easy to have a good orgasm! Listen... If we tell them we can hear them and they're bothering us, every time they're fucking and she's about to come, she'll suddenly see our faces. Our faces! It will be as if we were sitting on their bed staring at them and repressing them. She might never feel that much pleasure again and I'd never forgive myself. You think it's funny? Yes, sometimes I think you're funny. But you're not going to convince me. This is all too deep for me. I've got my own theories, though. You can tell me some other time. They're about to come down. Don't say anything today, please. We'll talk about it another day. So, we'll have to see them again? No way! You'll end up buying another rug. You used to care. About what? Us! We used to care about each other. Ana! Ana! Don't start your little game of making me feel guilty! They're just rude lowlifes! You want me to believe they don't know we can hear them? On top of that, we have to feel responsible for their orgasms? They scream and moan because they don't give a shit about us. Period. If I make noise at night, I know that I'm bothering others. They should go to a hotel to fuck! But no... And you know why not? Because they like to be heard. It turns them on. And now we've gotta put up with them here and not say a word? I'm sick of having to be polite. And excuse me for saying so, but you didn't use to be like this. You weren't so concerned, about what others think. You win. I'll tell them not to come. Thank you. You're welcome. What excuse are you going to give them? None. I'll say we're fighting, as usual. Sounds believable... If they're not out of here in ten minutes, I'll get an urgent phone call and I leave. Up to you. Julio. What? I'm nervous. Let's call a truce. Sure. For ten minutes. And touch me once in a while. - Do you want me to touch you? - Yes. Where do you want me to touch you? Wherever you want. Some affectionate gesture. Okay, whenever you want. Make a sign and I'll touch your ass. Okay... I'll open the door now. Hello, it's you! - How are you? - Fine. - Hello, Ana. - I'm... We're so glad you're here. Julio, look, they're here. We're not interrupting anything, are we? Since you didn't come to the door... Why? No, of course not. You sure? If you like, we can come back later. Of course not. Please come in. - Okay... - Come in, come in. She said you were making love, but it looks like you were arguing. Salva's like that. He always says whatever's on his mind. Yes, we were talking. We were ending a conversation. A contentious issue. Do you like contentious issues? We love them. Well, come in. What do you think of the apartment? You haven't seen it yet. Since you didn't want to invite us over... Very nice. Congratulations! You've got very good taste. - Thanks. - Very good taste. It's bigger than ours. The energy's really moving. No kidding! Where? Julio... All over the place. You can tell it's an apartment that is well loved. I do! I really love it. I'm very proud of what we've done. - Sorry! I've teared up now. - It's all right, Ana. She often gets moved to tears. I'm like you, too. With crying and... - yelling. - A lot. I could have guessed... That's a real delicacy, my specialty. A recipe from India. - You shouldn't have! Thank you. - It's spicy. - And aphrodisiac. - An aphrodisiac, that's great! - Come with me. - Yes. - How are things? - Fine. - Sit there. - Thanks. - And your daughter? - She's very happy. I mean, where is she? She's staying at her cousins'. They do have a piano, see? Yes. Why? We hear it often. - Does it bother you? - Not at all. On the contrary. I love it. Who plays it? Martina, our daughter. Well, and Julio. He's a musician. Really? Do you play the piano? Occasionally, when it asks me to. What kind of music do you play? I doubt you're familiar with it. Classical! Beethoven is his passion. Sometimes I think he'd rather have married him than me. - Are you famous? Are you on Google? - Only under "Contacts". We love music. Do you give concerts? We could come to see you someday. He teaches at the conservatory now. Well, to each... Wow! What a beautiful rug! Isn't it? Yes! I really like rugs. So do I. Julio doesn't, though. No? They're awesome. You can take a nap and also... He got it, Salva. No, I didn't. What else can you do on a rug? - Fuck. - Precisely... - Salva! - What? I haven't asked if you'd like a glass of wine. Sure... Do you smoke in the house? Yes, go ahead, smoke. It's fine. - You should come over more often. - Whenever you like. Julio. - Will you pour the wine? - Got an ashtray? Drop the ashes on the rug. That's what we do, right, dear? - Julio's quite the joker. - I've noticed. Yes, but only when we have guests. Don't worry if the rug catches on fire. Salva will put it out. What do you mean? Salva's a firefighter, dear. For years... A firefighter! Brigade Chief. I'm one of the bosses now. A firefighter, Brigade Chief? It all makes sense now. What does? No, it's just that... I feel safer knowing we've got a fireman as a neighbor. In what way? In case of fire or if the building's about to collapse due to some strange vibration. What type of vibration? Laura! You've got to stop by the shop sometime soon. I went by the other day, but you weren't there. Maybe I was out. I saw I skirt I liked, but I thought... - Sorry! - It's all right. I get nervous when I have guests. Silly, isn't it? - It's not silly, Ana. - It isn't? We're all vulnerable to others' judgments. I really am. Excuse me, what did you say? We're all deeply affected by others' opinions. She's a very good psychologist. You're a psychologist? Wow! What an interesting combination. A psychologist and a fireman. It's so... It's so... Here. - A cup? - We have no ashtrays. Well, we have one, but it's on the rooftop because it loves being alone. It's a great friend of his. He always goes up to see it and they talk, right? You guys really go at it, don't you? Full steam ahead. That's right. It doesn't look that way at first glance. You're always so quiet in the elevator... I get dizzy in elevators. Some ham? - No, thank you. I'm a vegan. - You are? I'm not. Can I show you the rest of the apartment...? Sure. This way. You're not coming? I've already seen it. - I don't want to smoke near her room. - Thank you. Don't talk about anything interesting. - We'll just talk about neighborly things. - Sure. We did some remodeling It was Julio's grandparents' apartment. He used to sleep in this room. And now it's my daughter's. Here's the bathroom. Look. - Pretty, right? I love it. - Yes, it is. And this is our bedroom. - What a big bed! - Yeah... - There's room for plenty of people. - Yes, lots... - Can I sit down? - Of course! - Very comfortable, it doesn't squeak. - Not at all. - That's important. - It really is. We should get a new mattress. Ours is... What? Pretty banged up. - It's empty. - What? Would you like more wine? - No, better not. - Why not? No... I get drunk really fast and then there's no stopping me. - You're not like that? - Yes, I am. I am. Julio can drink and drink, and he never loses control. - I like that. - What? Losing control now and then. You need to, don't you think? I love to dance, I really do. But Julio doesn't, so... - I love dancing. - I can tell. You can? How? - That's how I hooked up with Laura. - Dancing? I'm jealous. - Are you? - Yes, I am. I have to go to the bathroom. Let's go! - Here! - Thank you. You had other things to do tonight... Is it that obvious? It's all right. This way we can get to know each other a little better. Yes. In the elevator, it's hard. In the elevator? Yes, it's awkward, isn't it? Being so close together, each looking away... - You feel shy... - Yes, you do. The elevator is... How long have you been with Salva? - Two years now. - Two years. - I was married before. - I'm sorry. You see? You'd never have said that to me in the elevator. That's true, not in the elevator. One night I was lucky enough to meet Salva, I packed my bags and went off with him after three weeks. Wow! And you look so formal and harmless... I used to be. But not anymore. No, not anymore. It's like you and I know each other better than we really do. Yes, it's true. Actually, we hardly know each other. That's the way it is with neighbors. But don't you find at times that there are people you only have to look once at to... - What? - Connect, right? Maybe. Let's smoke. I feel like smoking. I don't smoke. A puff once in a while. Just a little puff can make you feel good. Here's where Julio hides them. He thinks I don't know, but I do. Thank you. An ashtray because a cup is kind of tacky. We have an ashtray, don't we? Is it over there? - It's right there... - I'll help you. Yeah... - I got you! - Thanks, Salva. - It's all right, Salva. - Go on, go on! Who needs a ladder when you've got a fireman in the house? Thanks. Laura, we haven't tried your special dish yet. Well... Julio, have them sit down and I'll bring a serving spoon. You heard her. She's the boss. Salva, can you please help me with...? Here, dishes for the four of us. Have you met the new neighbors on the first floor? I ran into them by the front entrance. They seemed like polite people, very aware of the basic rules for living in a community. Julio! Yes, dear? Will you put on some music? If I must... What do you want to listen to? Country. I meant music... Country! We like country music a lot. We go dancing at a bar. Why don't you come? It's great fun. I don't think Julio likes dancing much. Am I wrong, Julio? Actually you're not. I don't like dancing much. You know what? Let's not put on any music. That way we can talk about important matters. You don't look well, dear. Are you feeling okay? I just got a bit... I'm just a bit anxious. If you don't feel well, we can come some other time. - No, please. - No, not now. We were about to discuss some contentious issues. Sit down, please. Great. Thanks, Laura. - I'll pour. - Thanks, dear. I'll leave this here... Let's try the delicacy you brought. We're really glad you invited us over. It's the least we could do. You helped us a lot. We returned the hammer, didn't we? - What hammer? - Wine! Pour me some, please, Salva. - Sure. - Thanks. Here. - Let's see if you like it. - Thanks. Here we go! As I always say, bon appetit! - Very nice! - It's really nice! Very nice. Since we're here tonight, we wanted to tell you something. Oh, good. What a coincidence! - A coincidence? - What is it? Just something silly. We do, too. - You also what? - We wanted to tell you something. - Really? - Yeah. - You guys go first. - No, you first. - No, please, you go first. - No, you go first. - Yes, we go first... - No, please, you go first. - It can wait... - We can go first, it's okay... You! You start, you're the guests. Salva... We wanted to apologize. - You do? - Why? We're aware that we may have bothered you. Us? Particularly at night. When? When we have sex. You? Yes, occasionally we make love. Of course, that's normal. Well, normal... Sometimes we make more noise than usual. We try to be discreet, but it's hard not to lose control. Especially if you're a fireman. If we've ever gone too far, we're sorry if we bothered you. Not at all. Right, Julio? Anyway, that happens to us all... We never hear you, though. You don't? Why would you? - Why? - Because we're downstairs. That's why. Some days we set all the furniture in our house shaking. So do we. The other day I found the piano in the sink. - Yeah... - Dear... So funny... We thought tonight was a good time to apologize. It's okay. We never heard anything, did we, Julio? Never. I sleep like a dog. You're lying. Me? - Him? - Yes. You're a liar. What do you mean? He means we know you called us one night. When? About a month ago. Three times. You called three times? - It's true it was a very active night. - Was it? Your phone number was recorded, and when you called to invite us over, I noticed it was the same one. You called and when we answered you hung up. How sneaky, how embarrassing! - No, Ana... - It's our fault! - Yes, it is. - It's our fault. Why didn't you tell me you were going to call them? I was ready to call the police. Don't give me that look! We've been talking about them and their orgasms for months. You talk about my orgasms? Well... We're a couple who talk a lot. We do talk a lot, so... - Maybe we mentioned it once or twice... - Not now and then. Every night. She didn't want to tell you, but you can talk about anything among neighbors, right? - With us, definitely! Of course! - Yes, definitely! She was afraid that if we said anything to you, you'd stop having those atomic orgasms of yours. Actually, the one who has the atomic orgasms isn't her. It's not? It's always Carolina. - Oh... - Who's Carolina? - A friend. - Does she live with you? No, she lives in the mountains with Santiago. Who's Santiago? A friend. Santiago is really big and he breathes very intensely. He's like a buffalo. Maybe you've heard him too? Who? The buffalo, dear. The buffalo... If you've ever heard more noise than usual, it's because we sometimes have group sex. Yes, that too. Only occasionally. It's not like... If it's just occasionally, it's all right. Isn't it, Ana? If it's just occasionally, it's all right. - Yeah... - It's all right, of course. Let's smoke! Please... Let's smoke. We could have the next neighbors' meeting at your place. Our sofa opens out into a round bed. - Very practical! - We used to do it on the rug but... You could use ours. It's new. The rug's uncomfortable... Especially for certain postures. I guess... So it's with Santiago and Carolina. Yes, the four of us are the regulars. - The regulars? - Sometimes other couples join in. - Sure, for variety. - Always people we know and trust. That's reassuring. We learn new things and enjoy it a lot. It's one of those things we don't do because of prejudice, but if we tried it, I'm sure we'd like it and get hooked. - You get hooked on it, definitely! - Yes, you get hooked on it. I think the aphrodisiac in the food is taking effect. We swap partners. Swap... Or have trios. - Three... - Yes, or an orgy type thing. - Everybody together... - A varied selection, then. But never more than eight. Well, there were ten of us once. - It was Carolina's birthday. - That's right, it was her birthday. No big deal, a birthday's a birthday. We try not to make too much noise, but sometimes it's hard. - Yes, so many people... - Yes. It's true Carolina is really wild when she comes. And even when she doesn't... She just really loves sex. Carolina, right? - What? - Were you going to say something? No. No... No... I'm going up to the rooftop to see if Jupiter is still in its orbit. We know it may sound weird, all at once like this. Not at all! Each to their own, right, Ana? Everybody has the right to do what they want with their body. No, Ana. - No? - No. Sex is not in the body. Where is it then? Sex is... here. Is he really a fireman? A little more aphrodisiac food? - Well... Some water? - No, thanks. We don't want you to feel awkward, explaining all this to you. Not at all, we're neighbors, we can tell each other things. That's right! Plus, we're super open-minded. Have you also had any experiences like this? I'd like to, but my piano's very jealous. Have you been doing it for long? Since we met. We started by chance, opening up to new experiences. We're adults and we do it from a place of love and respect. That's very important in a couple. - What is? - Love and respect. Right... That's why not every couple is ready to share this type of experience. - They're not? - They have to be very solid couples. When we met, I had another partner and I took turns with them both. I should have been a firefighter. One day, I don't know how, boom! The three of us ended up in bed. We liked it and got used to it. - I see. - Take it easy. She said it's for solid couples. We're not ready yet. And we started forming a group. Santiago, Carolina and some friends. A party, right? Yeah, something like that. But no drugs. They're prohibited. You do well, no drugs. - We smoke pot, now and then. - Everybody does. - And a little ecstasy sometimes too. - A-ha! - You ever tried it? - No... I get a better high from effervescent aspirin. Try it. It's brutal, don't be afraid. - Who said I was afraid? - Julio... I meant sometimes it's good to lose a little control. Don't be afraid. - That's enough... - Napkins, we need napkins. I'll go get some. - Sometimes we drink champagne. - It's relaxing. Yeah, it is. At first when you take off your clothes, you feel a little shy. Everybody lacks confidence about their body. I'm not embarrassed about being naked. We aren't either. I know. We like having some red lights and music. Don't worry, we've never heard it. Have we, dear? No, we only hear the buffalo. Everyone's got their hobbies... That's good. Everything has to be agreed on. Fellatio and anal sex too. Anal sex? - Everybody needs to know what they like. - I see. You like anal sex a lot. Right? Well... I do, but not everyone does. Well, all of us to some extent. - All of us to some extent? - Like it. You do too? You never tell me anything. Maybe that's because you're never home. We speak so openly about this with you because you seem like a very liberal couple. We'd never mention it to the Valladares. The Valladares! No, better not. The only thing the Opus Dei members do in a group is pray. The Valladares... We connected with you two when you came to the building. - There was sort of an energy... - Yes, there was an energy. We're very open, very Leftist. See what I told you? - What did you tell her? - That you were like us. Like you? That you liked this stuff, too. Like Ana... You like being looked at when you walk down the hall naked. - You see my wife in the nude? - Through the courtyard window. You see Ana through the window? You're sure it's not Mrs. Valladares? She just wishes she was as attractive as Ana. Any comments on this revelation? - That might have happened once! - More than once, Ana. I hear "more than once"! The first time was by chance. Since then, if I'm in the kitchen, you walk around naked so I see you. That's why you don't like curtains! It's impossible to keep secrets with him, as you can see. I'm definitely going up to the roof. - Julio. - Yes? We all like walking around naked at home. I don't. Not if I know my pervert of a neighbor is watching. - Are you going to justify yourself? - No. It's true. I do it sometimes and that's that. Come on, look for some excuse... - I'm not like you, I won't. - See? We've got something else in common. Really? What else do you have in common? We both like to dance. - My wife loves to dance... - She does, Julio. You never take her out to a club, so all she can do is walk around naked at home. That's an interesting remark coming from a porn star fireman. Julio, please, they're our guests. No, they are your guests. I deserve some explanation, don't you think? Yes. I think you're right. I'll give you one. Excuse us. The first time I was coming out of the shower. - Out of the shower. - I was nude and when I went past the window, I saw him. - He looked at me and I kept walking. - That's how it was! And since then, after I shower, I usually walk past here, knowing he might be watching me. So it's become part of your routine. Yes! It's relaxing and makes me feel good. What's wrong with it? It's... important to have private moments like that. But I never look him in the eye! What does it matter if you look him in the eye or not? It makes a great difference. If that's so, I feel much better. Since it makes you so jealous, I will look at him from now on. What did she say is going on with me, doctor? It makes you jealous, but that's good. It's a sign of affection. Next time, let me know. I'll make a video and post it. You'll see how many people will see you. They're fantasies, private moments. Each person lives them as they like. You shouldn't make her feel guilty. It's not right. I bet after you look at Laura's tits in the elevator, you jerk off. - He looks at your boobs in the elevator? - Yes, always, but it's all right. In fact, I make it easy. That's what life's about, play! If not, what else? I like it when you look at my boobs. My God... So, when you lock yourself in the bathroom, you're thinking about her tits and not mine. I like hers more. I thought it was better not to tell you. Well done! I might start comparing now! That's enough, you two! I bet with that telescope you've got on the rooftop, you spy on your female neighbors. That's why you like going up to the rooftop so much? I like looking at the stars, being alone and thinking. If it's a cloudy day, I check out the neighbors. There are a couple of lesbians who never stop making love. They're really gorgeous! Well, she walks around naked to be looked at, and you get off on gorgeous lesbians. - And with your wife's boobs. - And with my wife's boobs. So what? - Don't you feel well? - It's just a tumor growing in my head. Maybe it's time for us to get going. - Yeah... - We're having such a good time, aren't we? If you hit me again, I'll have to deck you one. I love this guy, I really do. Come on, Salva. - Thanks for having us over. - You're welcome! We'll have to do it again. - Next time at our place. - Sure! - We can organize a round bed. - Why not? Really? What? - What did I tell you? - What did you tell her? That's enough for today. Why? - That's what we're here for. - Didn't you come to see the apartment? - That was just an excuse. - An excuse for what? - We'll discuss it another day. - Yes, at the next neighbors' meeting. So why did you come then? To invite you both to have sex with us. Did you hear that, Julio? Yes, but I'm pretending I didn't. Let's go. Don't be shy! We've been talking about having sex with you for months. Did you really? Talk about having... with us? - A long time ago. - We did, too. We always talk about you. You can notice these things. Go on, tell them! Well, there it is... You're a very attractive couple... - Thank you. - And we think you're hot. So do we. We'd love to share some kind of sexual experience with you. Swap partners... - A swap? - Or the four of us... - All together... - Whatever you want. Whatever you want. Think about it, and if you feel like it, we'll move ahead. OK, good... When? Our weekends are full of our daughter's activities. Ana. They're inviting you to an orgy and that's your answer? I'm just feeling anxious. It's the first time I've been invited to an orgy and I'm nervous. We're among friends. If you decide not to, no problem. - We'll just forget about it. - Exactly. Thanks for the invitation. We need to think it through. Just the opposite. It has to be done without thinking. Right now, if you want to. Right now? I told you not today. Too soon. Why? The four of us are here, we're relaxed, we've had a drink... We fancy one another. And I brought condoms. I haven't waxed. Come on, don't be afraid. Listen here, Mr. Hoser! Excuse me... Hello, Eva. I can't talk right now. I'll call you back. We're about to have an orgy. With Ana, of course. And with Carolina and some firemen. You don't? You're behind the times... No, I'm perfectly fine. I'll call you back, bye. That was my sister. - Shall I tell her to come? - Fine with me. Let's go. Bye. We're so glad you came! - Yes. - Well, okay... The Tupperware container! What? The one we brought. It's new. - I can get it some other time. - No, come in. It's no trouble. - There it is. I'll wash it out. - Don't bother, please. It'll just be a second. Done. If you like it, I'll bring another of my special dishes next time. We loved it. Especially Julio. It's a shame. We'd have such a good time... What else are you going to do? What else are we going to do? - Yeah... - Okay... Either watch TV or argue. - It's none of your business, you jerk. - Julio! You're a real jerk, Hoser! Julio, please! What do you mean, "Julio please"? This guy's a jerk and he's been teasing us the whole time. See? You're already arguing. Yes, we sometimes argue a little. - And you shout. - You hear us shouting? When? Maybe when you get hysterical... Like now. - I don't get hysterical anymore. - Sorry. You're right. I don't think you're ready... It's not the right time. That's it. Compared with you of course we're not. We haven't taken the round bed cult courses for perverts. He means they're unusual situations and couples need to... Excuse me a second... Are you really a psychologist? Careful, careful... Good night. Excuse me. Next time I hear four moans in a row, I'm calling the police. I'm sure they'll find minors in your sadist caves up there. - No, minors never... - I'm so sorry. Ana, you're with me, not them. Sorry if we offended you. Tomorrow's another day. We can go on being good neighbors just like before. We will. I want to make clear that I'll do everything I can to get you kicked out of the building. You see, I don't want to get into the elevator with my daughter and the perverts in your satanic sect. No, it's not satanic! Let's not overreact. They just invited us to an orgy. - What? - They just invited us to an orgy. You, with your great sense of humor, can't you see it as something fun? I really do feel like the tumor has burst open. It is my fault? Do you think I'm overreacting? They come here to give us lessons on being up to date. You have to be brave, we're cowards cuz we don't do drugs, our life is gray and boring, all we do is watch TV or argue... - And you say they're right? - I don't. You do. You always agree with everybody. We each have our ways. Yes, Ana. And what are you into now? Acting like some liberal woman who gets off on anal sex? We're pathetic! - Excuse us. We're not usually like this. - It's all right. Don't worry about us. We're among friends. I feel bad about leaving you like this. Please don't go yet. Stay a bit longer... You still might get laid, I'm telling you! - We're pitiful... Sorry. - Not at all. So, are we staying or...? Do you want us to do it, Ana? Do you want the four of us to start fucking? Or would you rather go off on your own with the fireman? He can give it to you on top of the washing machine! You know, maybe I do. That would do me a lot of good. It would be awesome! A good fuck is what I need! - I've got condoms. - All yours then, Hoser! Wherever you like it best! On the rug, I guess? On the rug? We're acting like fools. How embarrassing! - I feel so sad... - It's all right. Arguing is good. Couples need to argue once in a while. Where did you get that from? A manual for amateur psychologists? Wounds don't heal without confrontation or arguments. She's expressing a need. - That's very good. - Really? Really! Go on. All right. It'd do you a lot of good too, you know! Maybe you'd calm down a little and get rid of all that spite you wake up with every morning and go to bed with every night. You think you have the right to rub our noses in it, but you don't. No one has the right to make another person's life miserable! Pour a few glasses of whiskey, Hoser. We could use them. - Yes, go... - Okay. I can't remember the last time we made love, and even less my last orgasm, not even a tiny one, like the ones your daughters' hamsters probably have. - Ana. - Yes? I warn you that what's happening tonight between you is very significant. Care must be taken with what is said. Sometimes there's no way to take the words back. Hold on, doctor. I'll grab a notebook and take some notes. That's it! Defend yourself with your sarcasm! It's the only thing you know how to do with your intelligence. Wow! You've been building up tensions and reproaches for some time now. Reproaches. Re... proaches. You should be able to discuss things with serenity. Serenity. Sereni... ty. Why can't you be a little more pleasant? You're the one who avoids me when I come closer to make love. You're not really getting closer to me! I can't trust a person who doesn't treat me well. You'd screw the fireman and you just met him! What's wrong with us? We aren't like this. Don't worry, Ana. We're having a good time. This way, we're warming up to the round bed. You? You wouldn't be able to. You've got a big mouth, talk a lot but... I might do it, though. An orgy or whatever. You know why? No idea. Because I'm not a coward like you! You don't have what it takes to do any of the things you talk about! Do you want to add something before our guests leave? Your whiskey. Your whisk. Relax. We have to stay a little longer. We're partly responsible for this. Especially you. Make some herbal tea, some rooibos. Why don't we sit down and talk about what's going on tonight? We can stay a bit longer. Are you kidding? You want us to do therapy now? I prefer anal sex. Damn, what a night! First the snacks, then an orgy and for dessert, couple's therapy! Ana? What are you thinking about right now? About David. - Who's David? - A lover I never had. - Do you regret it? - Right now, very much. What was your relationship like? We used to work together, we used to have lunch together... I was completely in love with him. Did you ever tell Julio about it? No, but he knew we were friends. He met him a few times when he came to my workplace. - Julio... - Yes, Doctor Love? What memories do you have of what she's talking about? Well, he was fluttering around her all day long. He wasn't the only one. Ever since we got together, she always needs to let me know there is a man around who's crazy about her so she could leave me at any time. - Ana, are you still in love with David? - No. - Why did you think of him now? - Maybe I'd have been happier with him. Call him up then and we'll have a trio. Plus, he wanted to have children and so did I. - But you already have one... - I wanted more. And Julio didn't? If Julio had wanted more, they'd be running around here. Did you argue a lot about it? - Yes, we did. - No, we didn't. If we ever did anything silly, he ran down the next day to get a morning after pill. - And croissants, Ana. - Yes, croissants. He always had so many reasons not to have more children. I let him convince me, as usual. Honey or sugar? Give me some ammonia. - Are you angry with Julio about that? - Not anymore. - But you're angry. - Yes, I am. Because I'm 40 and I can't even buy a rug without getting yelled at. I really like cats, but Julio doesn't. Do you see any cats around? No. It's like that with everything. Julio... Julio. If you'll pardon me, I'm going up to see if I can still catch the lesbians. Did you always want to be a musician? You earn your living as a teacher, right? Would you have liked to continue playing? What happened to you? Do you think you were unlucky? Not talented enough? Are you angry because you didn't make it? Is that why you didn't want more children, so your dream wouldn't seem even farther away? Is it why you like going up to the rooftop to look at the stars, because being at home forces you to face all this? No. That way I can beat off while I spy on the lesbians. He'll never tell you anything serious. It's impossible. Definitely not with a psychologist who likes country music! - Why? - He doesn't deal with things. God forbid anything might upset him. In contrast, everything affects her. Not a long ago, she told a joke at a meal. Since I didn't find it funny, she wouldn't talk to me for two weeks. You laughed at me in front of all those people! Instead of helping me, you made me look like a fool. It was a really bad joke. So what? I'm your wife. You should have stuck up for me. You made me feel embarrassed. What did you expect? You can't live with someone who's ashamed of their partner. Well, we agree on that. - Julio. - No, Hoser, thanks. Ana. How are your sexual relations? Together or separately? When was the last time you had any? A long time ago, almost a year. When was the last time you went somewhere together? To the supermarket the other day. It was really romantic! I live my life and he lives his. At night we manage to coincide as little as possible. - Yeah, it's all planned. - Everything is. The two days I go to the gym, he's at home with our daughter. The other days he goes up to the rooftop to smoke. We go to bed at different times, and get up in the morning with some time in between. We don't coincide, we're a very modern couple. Very modern indeed. Good thing there's WhatsApp! That's all we have left. If we go on like this, we won't be invited to an orgy again. If I left home, he wouldn't even notice. Doctor, it doesn't look good... Not too good. Based on your experience, what do you suggest we do? Split up. I knew it was a bad idea to invite them over for dinner... You should split up before you hurt each other. We've discussed it a few times. All couples have considered splitting up at some point. What I really wanted to do today was have you over for dinner, and show you the apartment. I think that you've been piling up unresolved conflicts for too long. A lot of conflicts... You've argued too much and you haven't known how to forgive. - No, we've never forgiven each other. - Never. I've seen lots of couples like that, and get stuck in a vicious circle. Well, that's that! Don't worry about me. I'll go live in the mountains with Carolina. You know she's right. - You never want to talk about it! - What do you want us to talk about? The session's almost over. About what's going on with us! What happened to us. What happened to us? We do the best we can. Life is difficult, putting up with oneself is hard. Things are never the way you expected. I never thought I'd live in a house with no curtains. I'm serious, Julio. I'm always serious when I speak, even if it seems I'm not. Don't you know me? It's me, dammit! It's me. We've hit bottom tonight, we really have. What a shame! Just when I was beginning to like the rug... Is that it? Just like that? We split up? That's what couple's therapy is for. To split up. It'll be tough, but you'll get used to being without each other. - We will? - That's a relief. Here we go now. Time for the hardest part. Don't scare us anymore. What else could happen to us? You need to say goodbye to each other. Say goodbye? - Us? - Sure. You've lived together for many years... You need to thank each other for everything you've shared and given each other. You have a wonderful daughter... - Yes. - Yes. You were once really in love. Very much. You've been a good couple. You should be proud of it. - Give each other a hug! - A hug? We haven't hugged each other for a long time. That's why you should. Come on... - I don't know if... - I don't... Okay. Move apart now... Done. - How was it? - Fine. I teared up a little. Me too, but I hide it. Shit... Now I feel bad. We just wanted to fuck a little. You'll have to ask the Valladares. - Well, now... - Now... Yeah, okay. - Excuse me. - Please... - Now I wish you'd stay. - We won't know what to say. - We can make up the sofa for you. - What if the buffalo shows up? Stay strong. We've had a lovely time. Goodbye. You should take a little ecstasy now and then. You may be right. Good night. After you. - Let me... - No, it's all right. - I'll finish clearing up tomorrow. - It's all right. I'll clean up. We'll have to talk more about what we're going to do. I'm very tired now. All right, tomorrow. I'm going to bed. Maybe I should sleep on the sofa. Wherever you want, Julio. Ana... I feel bad about how I behave sometimes. And I'm sorry we haven't got a cat. It's true we hit bottom tonight. We said a lot of things to each other. Ana. What? I don't want to give up. I don't want to give up.
