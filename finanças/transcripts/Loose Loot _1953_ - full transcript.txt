[♪♪♪] Gentlemen, don't... I've been trying to tell you for an hour that Mr. Slipp is the administrator of the estate. I am only your attorney. Attorney-smurney. We want our inheritance. For the 50th time, don't you understand? The will is being probated. Oh, I forgot. In this morning's paper it said our inheritance ain't tied up anymore. Wait, I'll read it. [EXHALES HEAVILY] Come on, hurry up. We're waiting for you to read. Don't rush me. Rome wasn't built in a day, and neither was Syracuse. I'll read it. "Ambrose Rose Estate released from probate. "Three nephews sole heirs. "Huge estate turned over to executor. "The estate of the last Ambrose Rose, "deceased millionaire junk dealer, "was today released from probate by Judge Woodcock R. Strinker. "The estate is now held by the executor, Mr. Ichabod Slipp." A-ha. I've been trying to subpoena Mr. Slipp, but he's been avoiding me. You know, I think he's trying to pull something crooked. My right palm itches. What's that a sign of? Your hand's dirty. Oh. Why don't you leave him alone? Quiet. [BOTH GRUNTING] Gentlemen, gentlemen, you want your inheritance, don't you? STOOGES: And how. I'll have Mr. Drain draw up three subpoenas, and then it will be up to one of you to serve Mr. Slipp. [RINGING] Ichabod Slipp speaking. Oh, hello, Joe. Oh, you want me to meet you at the theater, huh? Okay. What? Ha-ha. Sure, I've got their dough. Hey, wait a minute, what's the address of that theater again? Circle Follies Theater, yeah? 919 Circle Avenue, huh? Okay, Joe, I'll be right over. Here's where we beard the lion in his den. Yeah, we'll slap Slipp with these subpoenas. Here. SHEMP: And he'll have to give us the inheritance. Yeah. Say, I wonder what this guy Slipp looks like. I don't know. You can search me. That's a good idea. We'll search all the offices. You stand guard. We'll get the filthy lucre. The moola. The "geetus." BOTH: No slippery guy named Slipp is ever going to cheat us. A-zoo, a-za, a-zo. Come on, get going. [CHUCKLES] So, Mr. Slipp, at last I catch you at your desk. Me? What did you do with my money, you... Oh, there must be some mistake. You bet, and you made it. Give me back my money, you crook. Hey, wait a minute... I had money, you crook. [CHUCKLES] Larry, anybody come in here? I think that crook is... A-ha. Mr. Slipp. Where's that dough you gypped me out of? Oh. [GRUNTS] [BIRDS CHIRPING] [EXHALES HEAVILY] Heh. Pardon me, did you happen to see... A-ha. At last I've caught you in your office, Mr. Slipp, you dirty crook. Them is fightin' words in my country. All right, let's fight. Oh, well, we're not in my country. Oh, copped a sneaker, eh? It's lucky he left. Yes? Ow! Oh. Oh. [CHUCKLES] The estate of Uncle Ambrose Rose. And we thank you.

[SPEAKING INDISTINCTLY] What'd he say? [REPEATS INDISTINCTLY] Get outta here. This thing is wedged on. We can't get it off. We'd better get a hammer and crack it open. Now you're using a bit of your brain. Go on. We'll get this thing off. Hey, I can't find a hammer, but this'll do. I'll shatter it. Step back. To the right. I've got it. Right between the eyes.

I'd have never gotten out of there without your help. You're sure you're all right? Never felt better in my life. Let's go. What happened to him? I don't know. Hey, Moe, how are we going to find Slipp in a big theater like this? We'll search the whole building. We'll start with the dressing rooms. And if we find... I found. [SQUEALS] It's him. It's those three jokers. They followed me. I'll tear 'em apart. [STOOGES CRY OUT] [WHISTLES] Hey. [SPEAKING INDISTINCTLY, SHOUTING] [STOOGES SCREAM] [SCREAMING] Hey, you. They went thataway.

Yeah, but we'd better get rid of this dough until we do. Say, here's a good place to hide it. Nobody'd ever look in here. Yeah. [STOOGES GRUNTING] Hey, this excelsior is lumpy. [SNEEZES] Shh. BOTH: Gesundheit. Sounded like it came from over there. Let's get out of here. Wait. I'll go up and look around. Hey, fellows, the coast is clear. Come on, let's scram. Yeah. Listen. Shh. Now, keep your eyes wide open. Come on. [FOOTSTEPS APPROACHING] Hey, I hear footsteps. Must be my imagination. [STOOGES CRY OUT] Why, you... [BOTH GRUNTING] Oh. Ouch. Whoa. I'm sorry. What happened?

SLIPP: Go on, open up this door. I think Slipp broke through, give him the works. Ah! Why, you... Boy, we really flattened him. Nice work. We sure fixed him all right, didn't we, Moe? You certainly did. [BOTH GRUNTING] Hey, what's the idea? That was me behind there. How could it be you behind there when you're out here? You're crazy. Why, you... Nice aim, Moe. Wait till I get my hands on you jokers. If I ever... Hey, what are you doing? [LAUGHING] Hey, get me out of here. Can't you get out of there? How can I? Of course not. That's all I want to know.
