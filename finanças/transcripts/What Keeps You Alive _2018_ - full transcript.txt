But it's our song. Since, since when do we have a song? - Turn that, turn it down. - No. I think I should probably get a say if this is our song, don't you think? - No. - This is it. This is our song. - Get real. - I mean it. Oh, my God! Jackie, this place is incredible. Wasn't kidding when I said it was rustic. Where'd you say the infinity pool was? Oh, yeah. No, that would be the, uh, the lake. [instrumental music] Hmm. I have a confession to make. I think I love this place more than you. That wouldn't surprise me. I mean, I could never, but it's close, like, really close. Okay, you go explore and I'll make, I'll make dinner. Mm-hmm. Yeah, you will. So my great-great grandpa.. he got super lucky and, uh... after Canada confederated the government was giving people around here land for free if they promised that they would farm it.. and years later he built this place. So can we just live here forever? Have you seen my insulin anywhere? Check your bag. Back pocket. [exhales] Wow! Yes! Alright! Let there be light. Crazy. Oh, yes! I'm home. I'm home. [chuckles] [music continues] Hey, are these height marks from when you were a kid? Oh. Jackie, this place is massive. I can't get over how beautiful it is. Jackie. Jack. Babe? Jackie? What the hell? [instrumental music] [gasps] Hey. Sorry. - What were you doing? - Nothin'. Just.. Looks like the boat house didn't make it. You're right it didn't. [chuckles] I'm starving.

Don't, don't open it! It's fine. Just calm down. Jackie, don't.. Jackie.. Can I help you? Megan? Jesus! Is that you? It's me. Sarah. God, it's been a really long time. I... I didn't even know that you still came around here. Sarah. Yeah. It's been.. forever. Yeah. Hi. - Hi. - This is Julie. My... my wife. Sarah. It's really nice to meet you. Uh, sorry to come by so late. No, that's okay, we were just.. having a drink. I... I just, I hadn't seen lights on over here in ages. We got broken into last summer so I thought I should come by and check the place out. You have a place around here too? Yeah! Yeah just on the other side of the lake. Megan and I used to get into all kinds of trouble around here as kids. Is that right.. Megan? Well, I should, I should get going. Um.. You guys have a great night. Yeah, have a good night, Sarah. It's really good to see you again. See you around. I can explain. I don't even know what to say right now. [engine revs] Megan, Megan, Megan, Megan. Megan. Fucking Jackie. [panting] [instrumental music] [panting] [intense music] Hey! You wanna take it out? What do you want? Whoever you are. Please. I never liked the name. It never felt like me. And when I figured out who I was.. That I was gay.. I changed it. I should've mentioned it to you before. I'm sorry, Jules. That's not who I am anymore. Close your eyes. Please. Please. [exhales] Okay, open it. Do you like it? God, you're so cheesy. [laughing] I'm still pissed at you. I am. [gunshot] [gunshot] The scope isn't aligned alright. I still can't believe your dad never took you hunting. Target practice is enough for me. Killing for sport isn't exactly my thing. Killing for sport is not what hunting is. [cocks gun] Trust me. Straighten your shoulders, babe. Your form is all wrong. [gunshots] Holy shit! I know. My dad, he used to hunt every summer up here. One summer.. he wakes me and my friend Jenny up at the crack of dawn, and he says to us "It's time you girls learn a bit about life." [chuckling] So... he hands each of us a rifle and off we go. We're crying and complaining and.. And he's giving us hell for being such girls. Sounds like it. [chuckles] And eventually I go wondering off on my own but I get turned around. The next thing I know.. I find myself face to face with this massive black bear. It's just standing there. Not more than 20 feet away from me and it's looking right at me. So I line her up in my sights.. Boom! Down she goes. I race up to it thinking how proud he's gonna be, it's my first kill. But she's still breathing. She's struggling. Trying to stand up and... screaming out. What did you do? I lined my gun up to do the humane thing. But it jammed. So I just... stood over it.. the next 20 minutes and I.. I watched the life slowly fade from her eyes. I'll never forget it. My dad gave this to me afterwards. Just in case my gun ever jammed again. He used to say to me.. "You only kill what keeps you alive." What does that mean? It means we ate every single square inch of meat off that bear over the next month. Nothing went to waste. That's a pretty fucked up story. [Jackie laughs] Yeah, I know. [insects chirping] [intense music] [birds chirping] Hey, babe! I couldn't find a pen so I'm leaving a voice mail. I know, it's so '90s, right? Listen, I'm heading into town for a bit to grab a few things but, uh, I'll be back in the afternoon. P.S. You looked really cute sleeping this morning. I love.. [sighs] [instrumental music] [panting] Julie! Is that you? [gasping] Hope you don't mind me popping by. Oh, God, no, of course not. Just a second. [breathing heavily] Let me get you some water. Just make yourself at home. Daniel, we have company. [cutlery clanking] [water running] [instrumental music] [exhales] - Uh, here. - Oh, thanks. I... is this you and Megan? Yeah, and Jenny. Ah, you guys are so young. Does Jenny still have a cottage around here too? No. No, Jenny passed away. Oh, I'm sorry. Uh, just about two weeks after that photo was taken actually. Jesus. Quite the endurance test, isn't it? Yeah, it's deceiving, that's for sure. [scoffs] Yeah. I'll be right down. Sorry. Okay. - Julie, right? - Yeah. - Daniel. - Hi, nice to meet you. Nice to meet you. - Red or white? - Water is good. Thank you. Sorry, I just want to straighten this up but did, did Megan not tell you anything about Jenny? Uh... no. Never. Why? What is it? Well.. I guess it's a little bit strange, don't you think? I mean, that was a really big deal for us. Okay. Well, I'm gonna get another glass of wine. [chuckles] So, are, are you guys up here very long, or just the weekend? Uh, yeah, just, just for the weekend. It's our, uh... one year anniversary. - Oh, congratulations. - Yeah, thanks. [instrumental music] [panting] Can you help me? Come here. Is everything okay? Yeah. You're not a good liar, Jules. You haven't said more than a few words to me all day. Why didn't you tell me about Jenny? Your childhood friend. Sarah, she made it sound like you had something to do... Wait. Wait. - You saw Sarah? - And her husband Daniel. Yeah. Yesterday. Jesus! [sighs] [exhales] Sarah, Jenny and I.. we used to swim out into the lake. We would try to race across to the other side. [chuckles] We were just stupid and young. One summer, Jenny challenged me. I was about half way across.. And I started cramping up, so I.. I stopped. I looked around to see where she was.. and I, I couldn't find her. [sobbing] The search and rescue pulled her body out of the lake.. two days later. And the police questioned me. I was cleared of any wrongdoing. [sighs] I would never have done anything to hurt Jenny. She was my... my best friend. [instrumental music] Hey. Hey. Do you really think that I.. No, no, no. I don't know.. I don't know what I thought. Come here. I guess I probably shouldn't have invited them over for dinner on Sunday. [laughs] No, you didn't. I did. Okay, you're cooking. - No way! - Yeah. [grunts] I used to be really good, you know. Like I was the only girl on my team. God, Jackie, this view is just... - Ahh! - Huh! [Jules screaming] [intense music] [water gushing] [fire crackling] She fell off a cliff. 911, my wife, she fell off a cliff. Oh, my God! Please help me. Okay, okay, okay. [clears throat] [breathing heavily] [sobbing] 911? [exhales] It's my wife, she.. [sobbing] She fell off a cliff.. I don't know what happened, she.. Just wake up, babe. Please. Oh, my God, she's not responding. She's not responding.. [groans] She's not breathing.. Oh, can you please save her? [laughs] Alright now. She fell off a.. She fell off a cliff. She.. Oh, my God. Oh, God, I don't know what to do. What am I supposed to do? Baby, wake up. [intense music] What the.. [gasping] [intense music] [groans] [gasping] [panting] Here we go.. [inhales sharply] [groans] [coughs] [indistinct] Baby, where are you? Are you okay? [intense music] Ah! Let's go home. Baby! Where are you? I'm so sorry. I didn't mean to. Are you okay? Please just call out if you can hear me, okay? Baby? Baby, talk to me. It was an accident I swear, I don't know what happened.. I'm just, I'm freaking out. I'm scared. [whimpering] [exhales] Fuck. [intense music] [crying] [breathing heavily] Baby, please just talk to me! I love you so much. I'm scared. Please. [sobbing] Baby, please. [breathing heavily] Call out to me if you can hear me, okay? Hey, come on. Jules, please. I'm so fucking scared. Jules, are you okay? Let me take you home. [instrumental music] Jules! Where are you? I'm done playing around. You must be confused. I mean, why would your wife do this to you, right? You're probably thinking.. [chuckles] "Maybe she's had a psychotic break." [instrumental music] After all... we're in love, right? I know these woods.. like the back of my hand, Jules. I'll find you. It's only a matter of time. [thunder rumbling] [thunder rumbling] Oh, shit! [sighs] [heavy breathing] - Caw! Caw! - Ha-ha-ha! You're so weird. - Caw! - What is that? - What is that? - Guess. - Obviously a rooster. - No! [laughing] Caw! Caw! - Mm, mm, mm, mm. - Caw! Caw! - Oh, I know. I know what it is. - Yeah? - A seagull. - Oh! Caw! I'm a crow. How did you not know that? Crow is the... smartest bird in the wild. [inhales sharply] [laughing] Well, I'm.. a bald eagle. Are you scared? Just a little bit. [crickets chirping] [dramatic music] [birds chirping] [exhales] [groans] [gasping] Don't go to sleep, Jules. [thinking] Fight it. Fight it. Fight it. [retches] [groans] [breathing heavily] [groaning] [grunts] [grunts] [breathing heavily] Find the road. Find the road. [breathing heavily] [birds chirping] [breathing heavily] [Jules groaning] [bird squawking] [dramatic music] [panting] [music continues] [panting] [groaning] Okay. Phone. Phone. Phone, phone, phone, phone. Where's the phone? [mumbles] [panting] [groaning] Shit! [mumbling] [grunting] [panting] Oh, God! My phone. [grunts] Bitch! [breathing heavily] Come on. Come on. Come on. Come on. [yells] [groans] [groaning] [breathing heavily] Bruised spleen. It's not ruptured. It's not ruptured. Okay. [groaning] [grunting] Ankles broken. Shit! [breathing heavily] Oh, no. Okay, now. It's just a sprain. Okay. Okay. [groaning] [panting] [mumbles] [breathing heavily] [screaming] [dramatic music] [door closes] Ah! [grunting] [panting] [gunfire] [grunting] Fuck off, Jackie! [gunfire] Shit. [dramatic music] [breathing heavily] Why are you doing this? I just wanna talk to you, Jules. Jackie, stop! [grunting] [breathing heavily] Ah! No, no. Oh, shit! No. [whimpering] Oh, you're dead. You're dead. Get away from me, Jackie, you fucking psycho! Ah! [laughing] [intense music] [Jules grunting] [breathing heavily] Jackie, get away from me! [grunting] [panting] Fuck! Oh, God! No! [grunting] [thudding] Nice try! Don't you even dare, Jules. [whimpering] We'll work this out. I promise. Now, don't move. [whispering] Why are you doing this? What, what the hell is wrong with you? We're not doing this right now, Jules. What the hell is wrong with you? We're not doing this right now, Jules! Everything okay, ladies? You alright? If you say even one word I swear to God, this won't end well. [dramatic music] Hey! You must be Daniel! I've heard good things! We're okay! Jules just got a bit cramped up so we're gonna, we're gonna turn this boat back to shore! Wow, trying to make the trip again, huh, Jules? It's impressive! Alright, well, we'll see you tomorrow night then! A... actually you know what? Tomorrow is not looking so good for us. Tonight is! Uh, yeah. Okay, Th... that works better actually. Uh, 8:00 p.m. Yeah, that's great! Okay, well, uh, we'll see you then! What the fuck did I just say? You.. There is only one way this works. You fall you die I'm in pain. [Jules sobbing] But of course it has to look like an accident. [Jules whimpering] How much? Well, you should know that, Jules. You're the one that signed the policy. Did you ever love me? No. I saw right through you from the second I laid my eyes on you. You're not gonna get away with this. As soon as they get here I am going to scream so goddamn loud. - No, you're not. - Yes, I am. I'm gonna tell them exactly.. [muffled scream] [coughing] [sighs] Jules? Jules? Jules, if you give even the slightest indication that something is wrong I'm gonna take this knife and I'm gonna stick it right into Sarah's chest. Right here. Right into her solar plexus and drag it all the way down to her stomach before ripping it out along with everything else that comes with it. Do you understand? [fire crackling] Your story.. What your dad said.. To only kill.. what keeps you alive. This isn't what he meant. You're sick, Jackie. But I can get you help. [breathing heavily] It's okay. It's not easy to admit. I understand. But I'll stay by your side. I will. Please, Jackie. I'll let it go. All of it. We can just get in the car and drive and get as far away from this place as possible.. before they show up. Please. I never told you about my first wife, did I? Erica. We got married when I was only 19. I guess it slipped my mind until now. [dramatic music] [groaning] How? We were on vacation. She went swimming after having a few too many. I mourned her. Prayed with her parents. Read at her funeral. I'll do the same at yours. I know what you're trying to do, Jules. And this little game that you're playing right now.. won't work. How much was she worth? [inhales] She was priceless. I never thought I would be having dinner with Megan again. Just breathe, baby and just be nice. It'll be over before you know it. Yeah, that's easy for you to say. Um.. - Hi! - Hey! So glad you guys could make it! - Yeah! Thank you! - Come in, come in. Don't worry about your shoes, just make yourself at home. Wow! Megan, it is crazy to be back here. - It's like a time capsule. - Yeah. It's been a, it's been a while for you. - That's for sure. - Yeah. We brought a nice bottle of wine. Oh, great! Uh, yeah, follow me. The glasses are in the kitchen here. Great! Open up a nice bottle of wine. Yes, let's. - Thanks. - Jules! Oh, it's so nice to see you again. Are you okay? Yeah, I... I'm fine. Did you, uh, strain yourself with all the paddling, Jules? Yeah, that's it. Nothing, a few painkillers and a shot of whiskey won't cure. Well, I hear that! Well, we, well, we brought a bottle of wine would you like to come have a glass? Love to. [instrumental music] [exhales] [indistinct chatter] So, Jules, when did you know about Megan? Julie? Julie? Sorry, I... I missed that. Just.. I was asking when do you knew Megan was the one? Megan, uh.. I don't know. Well, what I... I think she means to say is that.. it was love at first sight. [chuckles] Well, now that I want to hear. Uh.. L... love happened slowly for me. And then all at once. You start to notice all the little things. The good.. and the bad. The way they blink a lot when they think hard. The way they laugh at jokes that aren't funny. [chuckles] And all the little nuances that get under your skin. Like the way they, uh, shower for too long or, or hog the blankets at night, but.. but it's the way they see the world differently than you that.. that really draws you in. See now that I get. And even though.. even though.. you can.. never really know what's going on inside their head. I mean.. really know what's going on inside. You take the leap anyway.. and.. you hope for the best. And you just pray you don't get the worst. Of course.. with Megan, I got really lucky. [laughing] That was good. [laughing] Well, if it's anything like our marriage then I'm sure she's the lucky one. Mm! Really, I'm the lucky one? Oh! [laughs] [instrumental music] Yeah. She strained herself quite a bit today she pushed herself too hard. She's always overdoing it. So stubborn. My wife, don't tell her I said it. She actually, she's a funny one. She... she actually has these ideas about you. Uh, fantasies, really. [laughing] Oh, man. Mm. I don't, I shouldn't say. No, it's nothing, honestly. It's.. She just has this like, you know, idea that.. You know, that you're like a.. Just, you know, little bit of a.. - You know.. - A psychopath. [laughing] I drank too much wine, don't do that. That was good. You got me. Ooh, that was funny. Sorry, I shouldn't have told you that but, yeah, she thinks you're a psychopath, yeah. Mm, will you excuse me for one second? [dramatic music] [no audio] Daniel! Daniel, get away from her! What? What is it? I can't hear you! [dramatic music] Run! No! No! Oh, my God! No, please! Please, don't! Oh, my God! [screams] [grunts] No! Please! Please! Please, Megan, no! Please! Please, no! [both grunting] Jenny fought harder. [grunting] [panting] Give me your hand. Feel that? Your heart. Racing. What do you feel? It's.. it's steady. Exactly. [dramatic music] How deep do you think the lake is? [grunts] Oh, I know. Because I.. [grunts] looked it up. And I was.. debating.. on whether or not I should drown you in it.. or toss you off the cliff. It's 350 feet at its deepest point. This is on you, Jules. [retches] Keep it down. It's not gonna get any easier when I make you do the next one. [whimpers] Oh, my God! [gasps] [grunting] [dramatic music] Here we go. [music continues] You didn't have to kill them. I didn't kill them. You did. You were looking for an easy way out. And there isn't one. How many times do I have to tell you, Jules? Blot, don't scrub! Scrubbing will embed the stain and forensics will spot it right away. How come you never mentioned your dad until this trip? You would always just change the subject. Did he do something to you? Or your mom? [chuckles] No. He didn't. They were happy. Then what? What turned you into this monster? It's nature.. not nurture. I'm free in all the ways you're not. [piano music] You're trapped by emotions. Weighed down by guilt. Your conscience isn't a source of strength. It's your Achilles heel. [music continues] [music continues] [music continues] [music continues] [panting] [dramatic music] [music continues] [bed creaking] [intense music] [gasps] Eat up. [sighs] I need you to have a full stomach in case they do an autopsy. What are the pliers for? I can't have you falling off the cliff with stitches in your stomach, can I? [whimpering] Just one second. Just stay put. It's almost over. [humming] [door closes] [water running] [dramatic music] [Jackie humming] [intense music] Oh, my God. [clank] [engine revving] Do you just enjoy this? This was never about money. Why not just go skin a cat or something? Isn't that what people like you do on your spare time? [dramatic music] I know what it is. You're just desperate. Aren't you? To feel... something. Anything. Keep talking, Jules. Your words aren't gonna slow the fall. Nothing is. [chuckles] [music continues] No, you're right. They're not going to. [Jules grunts] [Jules panting] Ugh! Oh, no. Come back here! [panting] No! [panting] [intense music] No! Jules! Stop! [panting] There's nowhere left to run. Fuck it. [grunts] I'm gonna kill.. [shuddering] [sobs] [sniffles] [exhales] [sniffles] [sobbing] [instrumental music] [crying] [crying continues] [screaming] [crow cawing] [crow cawing] Caw! I'm a crow. Well, I am.. a bald eagle. Are you scared? [dramatic music] [panting] [panting] [keys jingling] Okay. [panting] Jackie! Jackie, where are you? Jackie, get out here! [panting] Jackie!

But that's not what I'm here to tell you. I wonder how you're feeling right about now. Probably starting to notice some symptoms. You know, Jackie.. you should really start paying better attention to what you put in your body. You see, when hydrogen peroxide is injected into the blood stream it creates blood clots that move through the circulatory system. And once those clots reach the brain.. guess what happens? [dramatic music] You have a stroke. [gasps] God, I really wish I could see the look on your face right now. I wonder how much that would be worth.
