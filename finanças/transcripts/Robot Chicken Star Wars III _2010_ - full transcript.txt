What are you doing? Put me down. Put me down! Ugh! Yah! Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. Do you ever have one of those moments where you think, "HOW the hell did I get here?" Geez, what happened to me? I was ruling the Galaxy, had a cherry-new Battle Station... I mean, this place had an Omelet Bar... A straight-up Omelet Bar! And now look. My former intern's tossing me down a bottomless freaking pit. You know, come to think of it, my whole life has been a series of "What the [bleep]" moments. That, uh... that was my out. I didn't always look like a boiled COW hemorrhoid. Cast your eyes on that handsome devil right there. Don't be alarmed if your undies turn into a moist towelette. And that is where we'll put the skylight, Mr. Palpatine. How exciting! Only 23 and already building my dream home, right on the Naboo Beach. Hey, man, stop harshing those Gungan eggs! Gungans are endangered, man! Hippies suck ass in every Galaxy. What? Gungans aren't endangered. There's like a billion of them. They breed like guppies. Boo! Boo! Boo on you, man! Boo on you, dude! And that is why we should change the zoning law. And what of the Gungan eggs? We'll give 'em to the school hot-lunch program. Heesa say what now? Young man, you should consider a career in politics. Hey, yeah. I should. And I did. You're welcome, Galaxy. Never did thank that guy. And so, Emperor Palpatine has followed up the bloodiest war in the history of the Galaxy by imposing a tyrannical dictatorship and killing all the Jedi. I've ruined the Galaxy. Wheel! Of! Fortune! Ooh! See that little Cub Scout? Anakin Skywalker, baby. Eventually, I pick him to rule the Galaxy by my side. - Are you an Angel? - What? What? The deep-space pilots talk about how beautiful Angels are. No, I'm not an Angel. Are you a fairy? Fairies aren't real, either. Are you an elephant? I'm not gonna sugar-coat this. Mistakes were made. I really should have extended the selection process for... Oh, no. Please don't pick your... Ladies and Gentlemen, Darth Vader. I know you don't believe me now, but I promise it's all gonna be okay. Apparently, we are contractually obligated to follow that dumb kid's story, too. That's what happens when you sell the most action figures. Thank you, Fanboys. Who's this guy? He's not in my note cards. Is he gonna have a story, too? Huh? ugh. Argh! Gary, you'll be late for work! His name's Gary? I'm sorry, I'm confused. Are we doing my story, or are we just doing some random, pointless... Ah. Welcome to "Robot Chicken," apparently. Whoo-hoo! Now, this is Pod Racing. Did anyone else pick up that transmission? It sounds like a little girl is on our Comm Channel. Aw. Much fear I sense in young Anakin. To be trained as a Jedi, he must not be. He could bring balance to the force. Correct you are. I thought you said that would be bad. From the Prophecy, that boy could be. Can I ask what the Prophecy is? Why is that Something I don't know? I will tell him of the Council's decision tomorrow. Oh, so it's a Council now? It's not just the two of you? What about you, Dogface? Did you know that now it was a Council? Inform the Senate we must of our lessened ability to use the force. Who can't use the force now? I can still use the force. Let's put that one to a vote, because I don't even know what that means. Does anyone realize that I'm talking? Enough for today. We Should eat. Getting pizza, Yarel Poof should do. All in favor? Aye! ugh! I just got the coffee yesterday, and I submitted the receipt, have yet to be reimbursed. Is anyone else having this issue? But oh, look, if it's the will of the Council, then I'll go. Aye! Fine! Listen, Yaddle, I'm gonna need to borrow your car. Um... in the shop it is? I just saw it downstairs. Well, insurance and... Okay, then I am going. I am one of 12 Jedi in the whole Galaxy on the Jedi Council, and today, it's my job to get the pizza. Sure. Yeah, my parents... they're very proud. Bam! Rejected! Re-re-rejected! Ba-boom! Rejected! Bam! Do-do doodle-do! DO-do doodle-do! Do-do do-do doodle-do! Do-do doodle-do! Do-do doodle-do! Do-do doodle-doodle-d... This is my room for talking about nonsexual matters. Please, Annie, sit. We need to talk about us, how... Is that lavender? Do you like it? I like to smell Senatorial. Padm?, from the moment I met you, I've thought about you every day. That's nice. I think of the Senate almost every day. I'm a Senator, you know. I'm in agony, Padm?! I can't breathe! Have you tried Yoga? All us Politicians do it. Ungh. Ungh, that's tight. If, uh, you're suffering as much as I am, please tell me. Oh, Annie. You're a Jedi, and I'm a Queen and a Handmaiden, and a Senator. ugh. Whoops-a-daisy. Uhh... Let's get you clean, dirty boy. Sorry. You're in my very soul, tormenting me. Ungh. I wish I could just wish away my feelings. But I can't! I will not get into this. And neither will you. Throw it back, Dad. Dad? Henceforth, you shall be known as Darth Vader. Thank you, my Master. Hey, before you go, my face is really warm. Is everything okay up here? I don't know. What do you mean? Ah. Ah-ah... OW! Ah, ah, ow! My face! It's on fire! Well, there is a possibility that when you were fighting Mace Windu, he deflected some of your force lightning back into your face. Are you kidding me? How much? A lot. I don't think there was one bolt of force lightning that didn't bounce off Master Windu's light saber directly back into your face. And you just sat there and watched? Well, uh, turning to the dark side was a pretty big decision. Oh, my God, I look like... I look like I have a scrotum for a face! What am I supposed to call myself... Darth Syphilis?! If you'd made up your mind five seconds earlier, we could have ruled the Galaxy and maybe I could have gotten laid one more time before I died. Uh, I can see you're upset. I'm just gonna go slaughter those Younglings. Yeah, whatever. They didn't have calamari pizza because Mon Calamari are people, and I did not know that. Is everyone on the Council dead? Oh, I better hurry, then. My time is short! "Hey, everyone, I'm Yoda. Mmm, talk Weird, I do. Hate leads to anger, and anger leads to never letting anyone else talk!" Ah! Oh, no! Hey, dummy, I'm gonna call you Darth Mat from now on, as in "What do you call a guy with no arms and no legs laying on the front porch?" Mat. Darth Mat. Okay, okay, it's okay. We're gonna make this all better. I'm hooking you up with a Super Suit, - life support, new Gems... - Leather. You hear that? My boy gets the finest leather you've got. Full-body... black leather... I see what you're going for there. Kind of an S&M thing. Oh, and a cape. Yeah. A cape would be pretty wizard. And a sweet voice box. And flashing lights. Sure, sure. Built-in helicopter blades. Remote-control flying fists. Can we just put this idiot under? Vader, rise. Tar kin! Let me go! Uh-Oh. Hmm, is it one of these... Flip the switch... Or... Ooh, that's nice. Whew. No! No! No! No! You rang, Lord Vader? No. Oops! No! Beginning to see a pattern here, quite frankly. Choose your apprentice in haste, repent in leisure, as the saying goes. It's like Darth Pl... Do you know how long I kept talking before I realized you people were gone?! You could have told me that you were gonna... You know what, you know what, I don't want to get into this right now. Let's just keep going. Excellent! Order 66 was a complete success. My master, what were the first 65 orders? I'm glad you asked! Ohh... # Capture me a Wookiee, kick a Princess in the cookie # # Sabotage the espionage of a Bothan spy # # Activate the trash compactor, let's protect the main reactor # # Stab a smuggler in the jugular and watch him die # # Corrupt a teen from Tatooine # # Manipulate a Gungan and kill Naboo's Queen # # Trap a Mon Calamari, take a Tauntaun Hoth safari # # Hit a topless bar on Mustafar with artist Ralph McQuarrie # # Ohh # # Number 13, find investors # # Number 14, make a Death Star I? # While you're at it, draw some plans up for my Death Star 2 # # unmask a dirty Jawa # # crank-call General Dodonna # # clone a load of Cannon Fodder out on Kamino # You know what? I'll just e-mail you a PDF or something. If you don't have the time, then whenever you get around to it. You're an attractive man for your age. I am an attractive man for my age. You have a lot to offer a woman. I have a lot to offer a woman. Hold the elevator! I'll remember this! What's your I.D. Number? It's 1-1-4-2-EAT-MY-ASS. Come on, come on, come on. Oh. I-I'll get the next one. Plenty of room. No, no, I'll just take the escalator. Squeeze on in. I'd rather my robes didn't smell like a [bleep] Filet-o-fish all day, thanks. That's hurtful, man. Well, next time, just let it go. Let it go. - My Lord. - Stormtrooper. - My Lord. - Yup. - My Lord. Uh-huh. - My Lord. - Yo. - My Lord. - Mm-hmm. My Lord. - Stormtrooper. - My Lord. - Stormtrooper. - My Lord. Stormtrooper, Stormtrooper, Si-blah-blah- blah-blah-blah! My Lord. - Ugh. - My Lord. Go [bleep] yourself. My Lord. - Go yourself. - My Lord. Go [bleep] yourself! My Lord? Go [bleep] yourself! Aw. Whazzup?! Good afternoon, Ma'am. I'm selling fire insurance and would love... No, thanks. We'll get one. We'll get one. So all the Clones were like, "Pow, pow, pow!" And it was awesome. Jedi bodies everywhere. It was so awesome. I'm sure you killed all the Jedi, my Master. Of course I got them all, you moron. I said it was awesome. It wouldn't have been awesome if I'd missed any. Hmm. I'll have the Bisque. And I'll have the Cream of Spinach, but not with that ladle, clumsy. Ladle. Ladle, Ladle, Ladle. Ooh, Cobbler. "Ladle." That's a funny word. Wait. I sense a disturbance in the force. You didn't give us any crackers! Everyone I know is dead. Uh, have you got any more Mac and Cheese? Yes, We do! Hey, Gary, could you cover for me while I hit the head? I'm sitting on a cigar here. You mean drive the Death Star?! No, man, I can't do that. Come on, man, I'm growing a tail! All right, okay. Oh, oh, it's gone from prevention to triage! Clean-up on aisle my shorts! Come on, man. Where are you? Warning. On course for impact. What?! Oh! No! Uh...uh... No! Oh, no! Oh, no, no, no! Ow! Ugh! Aah! Hungh! N-n-n-no! What the... Aah! Oh. Come on, Gary! Use the Force! Go, go, go, go, go! All right, everybody. Back to class. Aww! My daddy works there. He shot first. And last. He doesn't use the Force. He just uses force. He has never called anything "Wizard." He has never "Had a bad feeling about this." Line. Boba Fett is... The most interesting bounty hunter in the Galaxy. Do you speak Bocce? Of course I do, Sir. It's like a second language to me. I'm as fluent in Bocce... All right, shut up. What about Spanish? Spanish? Yeah. Do you speak Spanish? Um, I-I... I am C-3PO, Human Cyborg relations, and I'm fluent in over 6 million forms of... Uh-Oh! En este clase, nosotros hablamos en Espa?ol. Bueno? Bueno. Me llamo Alfonso. Y tu? Como te llamas? - Me...llamo? - Si. C-3PO. Si. 3PO. Bueno. No, no. C-3PO. Si. 3PO. Si? C-3PO. Si! Mira! 3PO! No, I'm saying my name begins with the letter En este clase, hablas en Espa?ol. Entiendes? But... - Sientate. - But... 3PO! Andele! Andele! Oh. Hey, Arturito! En Espa?ol, por favor! Well, do you speak Spanish or not? Si... 3PO. What are you doing? You're supposed to be out plowing the field. It's hot. I'll do it tomorrow. Come on, man. It's your job. Uh, not really feeling it. Hey, could you move a little? You're totally blocking my view. Uncle Owen, this Droid has a bad motivator! And then Lord Vader shows up, and he's all... "what's this little girl doing here?" It was not a good day to be wearing white armor... let's just put it that way. I haven't laughed this hard in ages. I'm so happy you two stopped by. You know, I thought going door to door looking for those Droids was gonna suck. But if it gets me out of the heat and filled up with cookies and blue milk, I'm all for it. And speaking of blue milk, could I use your bathroom, Beru? Of course. Down the hall on the left. "Apply directly to rectal fissures"? Ugh! Uh-Oh. Nor good! Not good, not good. Uh... Oh [bleep] Uh, uh, uh, uh... Oh, it's spreading. Oh. Uh, Carl, we should go. Now. Don't be silly, Gary. You haven't even seen the Droids yet. Oh, that's okay. I don't 'think they're the droids we're looking for. All right, all right, Gary. Hi, Beru. Ooh, it's hot out there. Owen, these young men are here to see the Droids you bought yesterday. - Is something burning? - Got to go! Thanks for your time! Gary, what's wrong with you? It's like 165 degrees... Look! Oh, my God, Owen! Beru, what are you doing? Call the fire department! My photo albums! I can't leave them! No, baby, no! We'll make new memories! Run. Just run. Oh, now we're running. Single file, single file! We'll blame it on the Sand People! Oh, I'm burning alive! Uncle Owen and Aunt Beru... They're dead. Just like those Jawas. Oh, the Jawas weren't dead. They were just stunned. The-re's nothing you could have done, Luke. Had you been there, you would have been killed, too, and the Droids would now be in the hands of the Empire. But look on the bright side. The bright Side? Yes, I'd say this makes you the proud owner of one kick-ass Sandcrawler! Holy crap! Yeah! Boo-yah! Look Out! Filthy Sand People. Arr-duh! Arr-duh! Hey, try digesting this donut! Oh, I'm old, remember. I can make it! No, Luke... it's too dangerous. Yee-haw! Looks like Luke and old Ben bit off a mite more than they could chew. Right? "Dukes of Hazzard"? You know what? There's no need to drag this out. The pay-off's pretty weak. So, um, let's see. Trying to find the "pause" button here. Whole thing was just a bull-crap camera-angle trick. Sorry to string you along like that. Tell you what... we'll take a break, come back fresh. Arrested for stealing Imperial bread to feed my starving grandchildren. How can they execute me for that? Aren't you a little short for a Stormtrooper? I'm Luke Skywalker. I'm here to rescue you. They'll be back. I'll just Wait. I'll totally Check the basement. Oh, no! Don't you go in there, girl! Uh, Mr. Feet? Mr. Bob A. Feet? Sure, whatever. It sounds like the rebels are attacking! They came back for me! All right, kid, now let's blow this thing and go home! What was that, now? Uh-Oh. Ah, crap. I am in trouble. Ooh, there's that quarter I dropped earlier. Oh, this is gonna drive me bananas. Gotcha! Oh, missed it. Gotcha! Missed it. I have you now. Oh! The club soda dispenser! Aw, hell. They told me it was a bad idea, and I didn't listen. Then I choked them with magic. Oh, man. Oh, this is... this is nauseating. Whew. Uh... I think I have some dramamine in my shaving kit. Nope, that's hotel soap. Whoops. Well, that's what I get. I never use that hotel soap, but I steal it every time. Oh, I know I should help him, but I can't look away. Damn it! I'll see you in hell. Did you say something? What? No. No, uh, I was just... No. Maurice, you must go to the... Oh, looks like I missed my window here. The guy who sold it to me, he was like, "Well, you know, it flies like this," and I was like, "That doesn't seem exactly right," but you know what? Pretty damn comfortable. Did I do okay on hors d'oeuvres? Everyone get enough to eat? Hey, guys. I brought my cousin THX-1138. Hope that's cool. Hey, I don't want to be a jerk, but your cousin's got to get the [bleep] out of here. You know, I've never met another Wookiee, Chewie, so it'll be great to finally meet your family. You mean to tell me you've been naked all these years. What's in the cave? Only what you take with you. Your weapons... you will not need them. Stutter, did I? Hmm? Ugh, no use there is. Do what Luke will do, Luke will do. Oh [bleep] Oh, no! No! Killed him you did! I-I-I thought it was Darth Vader! Just some dude it was! The reason I say no weapons this is! In my defense, you phrased that as more of a suggestion. Think you would straight out his head off I did not! He kind of looks like me. Yes, kind of look like you he did! Jump out and scare you he would, then reveal his face he would, and blown your mind would be! What was the point? To make you think! Oh, like I was fighting myself or something like... what? To make you think! Oh, did you hear that, Chewie? He had no choice! Wait, wait, wait, wait... I'm backwards, you idiot! On... But look at that Caboose. Oh, aye-aye, Captain, Durr! Odd choice, man. I guess you're under a lot of pressure at the moment, so I shouldn't judge. Oh, oh, God! What the [bleep] man?! What the [bleep] just hit me in the eye? Who's doing that? Who's shooting [bleep] at my [bleep] face? Oh, is this yours? Oh, I'm sorry, man. My face seemed to get in the way of your flying metal massage wand... Sorry about that. Don't skimp on my umbrellas! You know what they say... let a smile be your umbrella. Well, my face is a big letter "T." I forget the point. I forgot the point. You got any more umbrellas, Ellas, Ellas? Whoops. I got it. Hey, you okay to fly, man? Hey, trust me, Isaac. I drunk better when I drive. Whoa, leave no Child behind. On Dancer, on Prancer, on Java and Blitzen. Whoa, oh. Party foul. You made me drink my spill. I mean, you made me drink my... I'm gonna shoot you. Hey! You, Sir, are an asshole. I Called Jodie Foster an asshole Whoa! And now, a sweet treat that's hard to beat, and I don't mean my teat meat! Are these hypoallergenic? Why do I have a T-shirt cannon? Boba Fett! Present. Boba Fett? Tastes like your mama's kisses. Where?! Aah! Hey, good lookin'. I'll be back to pick you up later. Wow. I'm kind of a badass. We're going to the Dagobah System, R2. But first, we better get some fuel. ugh. ugh. Ugh! Ugh! Ugh! Argh! Back from the dead, assholes! No! How about a little fire, Scarecrow? Take it like a man, Snowflake. Hey, I guess this deal's getting worse all the time. Hey, Sarlaac! Here come the fudge! Now, don't you go swimming for at least 20 minutes. Sit, Cujo, sit. Good dog. Boba Fett! I know, I know. I shouldn't wear fur. But I Saw it, and I just had to have ii. Do you hate me? I Can't see. Oh, right, the carbon freeze. Oh, it took your sight for a tick. Let me be your seeing-eye Fett. Aah! Boba, you got your money for turning me in... Shh. Don't spoil it, sweetheart. This one's for the love of the game. What are you gonna do? If only you could see what I hear. Tauntauns? Couple of funny facts... You're heavier than I thought, and Tauntauns never forget. Whoa, and I thought he smelled bad... Say it with me now... On the outside! It's beautiful! Hey, hey, let me go! Let me go! No, no! Boba. The whole thing was just a dream? "Yes" with an "if," "No" with a "But" We are in the pit. But I took solo and the whiny blonde kid out, right? Uh, no, you didn't. Well, the Sarlaac ate some more Sand People, though. You feel like Tusken food tonight? I guess. What was your dream about? I don't... I don't remember. Was it a naughty dream? Uh... Was I in it? The [bleep] Weequay?! Yeah, you know I was in it. Leia... Leia, hear me. I got you. Leia... I think I'm about to be mugged. About to be what? Man [bleep] you. Enjoy the view, Weather Vane. Come on, man! Get this mother [bleep] off me! Ugh! No! Man!

I win [bleep] kin you. Don't you leave me down here with this talking Walnut! You know what? That hurts me. That is one of the 10. One of the what? One of the 10? 9 times out of 10, I enjoy a good joshing, but one out of every 10... I will pay you 10 million space dollars for a [bleep] rope! Aw, man. I'm so [bleep] mired. I got my feet hurting, man. But I got to make it to the gig, man! Don't never miss no gig! I'm here, man! I made it! I walked across the desert, man! No! You gave the gig away, man?! That's [bleep] up, man! I'm 30 minutes late, man! That's jazz time, man! Sy Snootles and Droopy McCool dead in vain, man! You know what? You all suck. I'm gonna go throw myself in that desert The Emperor has made a critical error, and the time is... I'm sorry, who the hell are you? Prune Face, ma'am. Anyway. The Emperor has made a cr... when the face is a prune, then action goes boom! # Action! Excitement! # # Slaying loads of sweet ass # # Prune Face # # Prune Face # # Prune Face # # Prune Face # Well, then, glad to have you aboard, Prune Face. You'll be a great asset to this... Actually, I lied. I'm just here to fix the copier machine. The Emperor has... It's your toner, probably. # Prune Face # # It's a # # Tra-a-a-a-p # You're thinking of eating me, aren't you? I'm thinking the same thing, [bleep] Are you sure this is okay? You're in-country, dude. Live a little. Now, she's pretty sensitive, so go easy on the throttle, okay? All right. Whaaaaaaaaaaaa!! Oh, crazy kid. This is so awesome! It's like a dream! Whoo! Yeah! Bead Uh... God, oh, man, I hit that little thing. Oh, my God. Oh, geez, I'm sorry. I'm so sorry. Listen. This is my first ride on... Oh, God, Oh. Oh, God! Okay, pal. You know what? I'm gonna take care of this. Yeah, yeah, yeah. I'm just gonna put you out of your furry misery, okay? Oh, God! Oh, God! Oh, no! I'm sorry! I'm sorry! I'll fix it! No more pain, I promise! No more pain! You're going to a better place now. Gary, where'd you go, man? Oh! Ew. Gary? All good here. Be back soon. It's like a dream. Over. No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. You got to shut up, man. I know it hurts. I know. Just... just keep it to yourself! Sorry. I'm so sorry. You were so cute. Okay, okay. Pull it together. You're okay. It's over, G. What's up, y'all? Oh, Schnizzle. Me and chief drinks-a-lot over here, we was just putting back a few, and, you know. Glug-glug-glug-glug-glug! Right?! Right? Right. And now, Young Skywalker, you will die. Wow, I feel like my entire career led up to this moment. Feels good. I see you, buddy. Crazy. This is your son, huh? Guess you owe me one for getting you out of 20-odd years of back child support, huh? God, his teeth are so yellow. I guess when you look like a melted candle, flossing would just seem like pissing in the wind. Father! Oh, man. Was I that whiny when I was a kid? How come no one says "Wizard" anymore? Wow, this lightning really hurts. Like, really bad. I know it's probably not cool, but I'm thinking about playing dead. Nope, can't do it. This is so painful, I literally cannot stop screaming. I can't lie... if the Emperor asked me to kill my dad, I'm 50/50 on saying yes. That's how bad this hurts. Meh! Looked right in the lightning. God, it's like looking into a laser pointer. It's a completely different but equally painful type of pain. Oh, I'm gonna be seeing spots for like an hour. Hey, wait a minute. How is that my kid if this knob-job says I killed my pregnant wife? It's a madhouse! A madhouse! Wow, you're really looking into my soul there, buddy. Seriously, dude, what is it? Oh, my God, is he... Is he gonna try and kiss me? Is my dad gonna kiss the Emperor? Oh, my God. This is happening. Stay away from me, you idiot! Hey, listen, I don't mean to be a pain, but I'm gonna have to ask for a raise. What are you doing? What are you doing?! You guys are busy. Put... put me down! I'll come back later. Put me down! Father! That was pretty wizard, wasn't it, son? What? I'm bringin' it back! Put me down! You know, looking back, it all makes sense. Dream big... Live big... Love big... Fall to your death down a giant [bleep] hole. Now I know, which is exactly 0% of the battle, apparently. Think, Palpatine! How do they do this in the movies?! Oh, yeah! "Point break," bitches! Hmm, this looks promising. Aah! My Lord. Go [bleep] yourself! Aw. This is the same chasm! Wait a minute. Execute Order 67. # Like this # That doesn't sound like Order 67. No, no, wait, yes. Yes, it does. Yes, it does. I meant 68. Execute Order 68! What am I doing, man? What am I doing? This is the end. I've got to make amends for my life. Muy muy. Jar Jar, it's Palpatine. Look, I need to apologize for manipulating you into granting me emergency powers. It was wrong, and I'm sorry. Oh, say yes! Right, Palpy. Yousa manipulated me. Okay, palpy. Wow, that felt pretty good. Maybe that Skywalker kid was right. Okay, Palpatine, if you're gonna do this, do it. Let go of your anger. Let go of your hate. Oh, hey, there it goes. Whew, that's nice. I definitely feel a little one-ier with the force. Ooh, maybe I'll get to come back as one of those blue ghosts. You were right, Luke. You were... [bleep] Oh, my God. You might want to try a little manscaping down there. You're like a short stack of pancakes. Ugh. Oh, you stuck around. Great, you didn't miss the visual treat of my frozen corpse floating naked in a vacuum... just what Mama Palpatine dreamed for her little boy. Sorry, Ma. Anyway, if you stuck around this long, you'll probably want some final words of wisdom, so listen close.
