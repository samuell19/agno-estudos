All right, Roddy, old man, you can get yourself out of here, and you will. Never forget, the blood of the courageous St. James clan flows through your veins. A way out! Yes! Aah! Hey!

No, no, no, no, no. The humans don't like our sort. Speak for yourself. They like me very much up there. Oh, I don't like your attitude. I've got my eye on you, sunshine. Ooh! Ooh, hot, hot, hot! So... You're trying to get Up Top, me hearty? Yes. There's one person 'round here might be able to help you. - Might. - Really? Shady customer. The captain of the Jammy Dodger. - If you can find it. - I know where it is! And remember, the name of the boat's the Jammy Dodger. Uh, thanks for bringing me this far. You're welcome. See ya! Beware. Beware. Hello? Uh, permission to come aboard? Ahoy there? Uh... Ow! Yah! Oh. Oh! Sorry. I didn't mean to intrude, Mr. Captain Skipper Thingy. Hey! That's Miss Captain Skipper Thingy to you. - Oops. - What are you doing on my boat? Look, I've had a really bad day and I just need your help. See, I've been thrown out of my home, I've been flushed down my toilet. Thank you, too much information. I've got my own problems, mate. She's around here somewhere! Stay down. And keep quiet. Why? Who are we hiding from? I said quiet! There's rats after me who'd like to kill me. Well, I'll contain my amazement. All right, all right. Quiet as a mouse. Ah! Over there! You idiot! Sorry about that. Uh, I'll be offthen. Oh, sorry. Ah! Sorry. Sorry. Sorry! We can't let her get away! Shh. Shh. Come on, Jammy, me old mate, don't do this to me! - Come on. - Get her. - Oh. - Ah! Whoa! - Oh. - Ah! Let me go, you pink-eyed freak! I'm upset now. Ah! Whatever's going on here, I swear, I'm not involved. I'm an innocent bystander! Rita, Rita, Rita! You thought you could give us the slip. What you looking at? Keep still! Come on, then! Right! Who have we got here? I believe he said his name was Millicent Bystander. - Millicent! - Actually, no... Now, then, where's the ruby, Rita? The boss wants it back. I don't have your stupid ruby. Okay, are we going to do it the easy way... or the hard way? Oh, I think we should do it the easy way, don't you, Spike? Oh. All right. Check the tin. Good girl. See, Whitey, this is how I do it. Watch and learn, my son. Watch and... Was it in there? Right! Rip it up, lads! Hey, you get your filthy paws off my stuff! It's in here somewhere. I can feel it in me guts! That'll be last night's curry, Spike. I'm the same. I got a bum like a Japanese flag. Will you please tell them I'm not involved in this? - Nothing here. - Fine. All right, all right, listen up. This gentleman, he's not from around here. - Thank you. - Just look how nicely he's dressed. - Oh, thank you. - And why? Because he's an international jewel thief! - Precisely. What? No, no! - He stole the ruby from me! - If you just put me down. - No, she's lying! All right, all right! It's time to bring out... the Persuader. Your choice, mate. You can talk now or you can talk later. Ain't that right, Persuader? Yeah, in a much higher voice! The Persuader's alive, Spike! You'll be singing like a tea kettle. Good one, Persuader. I don't even know her! I don't know anything about anything! Careful, miss. You'll injure yourself. Oh! I know where it is! - I know where it is! - Come on, then. Spit it out! Don't you dare! Look at her bottom. I mean, is it me, or is it oddly shaped? You little snitch. The booty's in the booty. Hey! Oh. Thanks, mate! The boss is gonna be so happy with us. You're toast. So you're from Up Top, eh? I used to work in a laboratory Up Top. Yeah. Big shampoo job. I was dark grey when we started. Yeah. Still, it cleared up me dandruff. The World Cup has become the most popular sporting event in the world. Are you there, boss? We're back. ...plays Germany in the final. I've got it, boss. The ruby. I found it. Well, technically, Spike, it was Millicent that found it. Um, actually, the name's Roddy. And, and, in exchange for my assistance, I was hoping you might... Uh, you might help me out of the pickle I'm in. Hello, Rita. Hello, handsome. And who is this? Is your new boyfriend a waiter? - Boyfriend? - Waiter? The prize returns to me. Did you imagine that I would let you steal it from me? What? That jewel belongs to my father, and you know it! Your father? A good-for-nothing scavenger, just like his daughter! Uh, excuse me. Actually, I'm the one that found your ruby. So... you... um... Perhaps you'd be generous enough to repay the favor and help me get home. Help me! Dispose of them. No, no, no, please! I just want to get home to Kensington! Kensington? The Royal Borough? - Up Top? - Uh, yes. Up Top. Huzzah! A man of quality! Finally, somebody gets it. Come, let me show you my private collection. I know you'll find it diverting. My shrine to beauty. Works of high art crafted in tribute to our beloved Royal Family. Victoria's bust, wrought in porcelain. - Classy! - Quite lifelike, wouldn't you say? It's as if she were here. Mmm. Smooth to the touch. Easy, tiger. But come! Let us restore the heart and highlight of my collection... this ruby. Fallen from the very brow of ancient kings. A true crown jewel! Well, what do you think? He's a madman! Run away! Pardon me. My fly's undone. Well, your ruby certainly is a biggie. Indeed. How did it ever find me, here in the underbelly of the world? In this dark, low place. Yes, speaking of which, I'd love to see more of your collection. It's very amusing, but I do... "Amusing"? Didn't you say I'd find it amusing? I said you'd find it diverting, not amusing! Ah, well, when I said "amusing" I really meant it in the sense of the ancient Greek muse, the goddess of inspiration. Muse. Smashing. Oh, heaven help me! Ice him! Ice them both! Let's see if there's anything good in the fridge. Former enemies, one and all. A catalogue of thieves, double-crossers, and do-gooders. Prepare to meet your maker. Your ice maker. Makes me laugh every time, that one. Shut that door. Liquid nitrogen! That will freeze us instantly! There's a paper clip in my back pocket. See if you can get it. In the pocket, in the pocket! Blimey, it's cold. That's why I wore me mittens. Huh? Hit men don't wear mittens! Take them off! You're embarrassing me. Well, it's all right for you. You've got little hands. - Got it! - They don't get as cold. - I ain't got little hands! - Yeah, you have. You've got lady's hands. Well, they might be small, but they're lethal weapons, these. You've got your mother's hands. Right. Put your hands together. You could have wiped your feet. - Stop squirming! - Oh! Goodbye, vermin. Now, let me see the latest addition to my cubist collection. - What? Impossible! - Oi! Kermit! The prize returns to me! You big, fat, slimy airbag! After them! Why are you stopping? Don't we have a plan? "We"? Who's "we"? Wait, wait, wait. You can't just leave me here! Faster, you idiots! They're escaping! Oh! Oh... No! Not the master cable! - We have a plan? - Put that back! Wait, wait! That will never hold both of us. You're right. Toodle-oo. No, no, wait! F-f-f-freeze! Ah! Oh, no! No, no, no, no, don't break! There are things I want to do, sights I want to see! - That wasn't on the list. - Aah! Hey! Do something! Huh? Whoa. Ow! Keep your legs straight when you hit the water! - I kept me legs straight, Spike. - Ow. Ow. Oh, good grief, that's high. Quite high. Rather high. So very, very high. Hmm. Hmm. Yeah. Cool. See ya! Oh... If she can do it... Here goes. Ah. Ah! No! Ah! Oh! Ahh! And gently down. Oh! - My ball, too. - It's my ball, too! - It's my ball, too! - Rita? Rita! Oh, where is she? Rita! - Ah! - Target's at twelve o'clock! Oh, come on! Careful, Whitey. That's a banana skin. - Rita! - Whew. Over there! Ah! Whoa! Oh. You look pretty ridiculous now, Millicent. Ahh! Keep your legs straight! Oh... What are you, some kind of rat boomerang? - Give me back my ruby! - I haven't got your ruby! Okay. Well, now I've got your ruby. Uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh. Please be careful. That ruby means a lot to me. It's priceless! Hold on. It's a fake. No, it's blooming not. It's real! No, no, no, look, it's just glass. - It's real! - Fake. - Real! Real! - Fake. Fake. - Real! - Fake. - Real, real. - Fake, fake. - Real! - Look, look, look, look. You can tell. Watch this. There, you see? I mean, you can't break a real ruby. Right. I probably shouldn't have done that. Uh, but look on the bright side. I've saved your neck. I mean, once The Toad knows it's worthless, he'll stop chasing you for it. Roddy St. James saves the day. Oh! Good grief! You try to do somebody a favor, and they... Ow! A favor? That ruby was from Queen Elizabeth's crown! It fell down the drain of Buckingham Palace! Well, maybe the Queen wears fake jewelry. Keep still! Can we just talk about this? Real or not, that ruby was gonna change my life! Han Chin Chinese takeout. Yes, I'm being attacked by a madwoman. She's got crayons! - One chicken chow mein. With wonton? - No, crayons! No wonton! You want rice? Fried or white? - Um, fried. No, wait! - You want wonton or what? Uh, cancel that order. - Rita? - Just go away, please. Um... - I'm sorry. - Sorry? Me and my dad worked these drains for years. He broke every bone in his body trying to get that ruby. It was going to be the answer to all our prayers. And now, it turns out it was a stupid fake. Well... Maybe I can make it up to you. - Get stuffed. - No, no, no, I mean it. See, back at my place, we've got a jewelry box crammed with rubies and diamonds. Real ones. So... All you have to do is get me home to Kensington... and I'll make you rich beyond your wildest dreams. How do I know this ain't just a load of old rubbish? Well, I suppose you'll just have to trust me. I must be out of my mind. All right. You've got yourself a deal. Go on. You too. Your own hand. Where are those idiots? It's so hard to get good help these days, my boys. Yes, that's right. Oh, come on out, my lovelies. Cheer your old dad up. Poor Daddy, surrounded by filthy rats in this joyless, sunless void! But don't worry, little men. Daddy will get rid of them all! He will. They'll all be deady-weady. Mwah. Did you find it? - Huh? - Ach! Did you find it? Ah... well, we got most of it, boss. Forget the ruby! It's the master cable that I want. The one that grubby creature Rita took. Oh. - Without it, my plan is ruined! - Ow. Oh, okay, chief. Yeah. Forget the ruby. Ruby's gone. Woo-hoo! Yeah, see? You see? Moving on. We are now your cable guys. Focused. Cable-centric, boss. You need to be back in time for the World Cup Final. Oh, great! Are we watching the game together, boss? Just get the cable! Keep your legs straight! Should we be stopping with all those goons on our tail? We aren't gonna get far without a map, are we? - Is that a house? - Yes, and it's very dangerous. So... ...why don't you wait here? Waiting here. Excellent idea. Watch out for the piranha. Rita! Here you go, Annie. For you, too, Shamus. Mimi, get your finger out of your nose. Fergus. - Yes, Jojo, no biting. - That is wild good! Rita! Rita's back! - Oh, Rita! - Mum! Oh, Mum. Thank goodness you're safe. Rita! - Hello, Dad. - Give us a hug, girl! Whoa! Oh! Oi, Mum, there's a peeping Tom outside! Tom? Ohh, it's Tom Jones! Mother, it's not Tom Jones. That's just my passenger. - Oh, he's very good-looking. - He is not coming in. Soup's on! It's lovely. Thanks, Mum. So how long have you been Rita's boyfriend? He is not my boyfriend. So, are you gonna make an honest woman of my daughter? Dad! Well, we were thinking of a spring wedding, weren't we, cream puff? Look, I just want all of you to know he's... Tom Jones! So your name is "Roddy," is that right? Yes, that's right. Roddy St. James. What a beautiful name. - Hi, Roddy. - And who might you be, little chap? - They call me Shocky. - And why do they call you that? Shocky! Yes! Got it. Rita, where are you taking this handsome young man, then, eh? Well... Actually, that's why I need your maps, Dad. Because he's from, uh... ...Up Top. Kitchen. Now. Oh, sing us a song, Tom! I'm not saying it isn't risky. Yeah, but it's impossible, Rita. No one's ever got past the rapids at Hyde Park. - Once the current gets you... - Dad, Dad! He's gonna pay us.

He's an international jewel thief. A mastermind, a super-criminal. Looks like he crossed The Toad and got away with it. He's dangerous man, but I'm a thinker. I've got a plan. ♪ Whoa, whoa ♪ More! More! - That was brilliant! - Oh, it was nothing. - So you're from Up Top? - Yes. - I've met one of your lot before. - Oh, really? Used to be some old lady's pet. That's nice. Terribly lonely for him, though. He had no one to talk to. No one to cuddle with! - No one to shocky. - Well, that's no life, is it? Oh, I'd better get these dishes started. Oh, please, permit me. Oh, you're such a gentleman! Great! So I hand Roddy over to The Toad and claim the reward. Then we're all sitting pretty for the rest of our lives. - Is that the idea? - The Toad'll pay a fortune for him. He's a bad one anyway, so that's all right, isn't it really? Oh, you cheeky little monkey. I won't have no son of mine acting the rat. We Malones never go back on our word. - He's gonna steal your boat. - He won't steal my boat. - He's stealing your boat. - He isn't stealing my... - He stole your boat. - What?

Hanging out at the movies, playing golf, going skiing. It's just, just so great! No wonder you want to get home. Yeah. Well, I guess tomorrow we'll both get what we want. - Good night. - Good night, Roddy. Good night. Good night. - Good night. - Good night. - Good night. - Good night, Roddy. Don't let the bedbugs bite. Aah! Eee! Aah! Wakey-wakey! We're getting close to Kensington. Tie down anything loose. It's gonna be a bumpy ride. Aye, aye, Captain. Ah, thank you. - You're welcome. - Ah! - Bonjour! - Bonjour! - Bonjour! - Bonjour! - Bonjour! - Bonjour! Who invited you onboard? Hop it. Hop it! Ah... The English little girly, she's so aggressive. Le Frog. I like a woman with a little fire. You're going to pay for that, my little chocolate croissant! But first, a word from our sponsor. Marcel? Aha... Oh, I should have known. Well done, Le Frog! I salute you, sir. Now then, Rita, hand it over. Hand what over? This dance of deception must end. Return what you have stolen from me. Enough dancing! I don't have it anymore. It was a fake anyway. What? Oh, the ruby. He's cuckoo, but family. Oh, this is rich. The ruby was a pretty thing. Stop that. But nothing when compared to the master cable. The master what? The cab... Turn. The cable! The one you're now wearing as a belt. - Well, if that's all he wants... - Hang on. What do you want it for anyway? Oh, you'll see, come the World Cup Final this afternoon. The World Cup Final? Okay, okay, cousin, take a breath. Leave it to me. We'll get your cable, kill the rodents, and then me and my team can settle down to a decent breakfast. Okay, men, to action! We surrender! No, not that one, you idiots! The kung fu thing! Ohh... I've got a plan. Go for it. Fly at twelve o'clock! - Huh? - Oh, bother. Fools! Grab them! Le Frog! No! Get that cable! Oh, mon Dieu! You rats, this is not over yet! Roddy! The rapids! Oh, no! En garde! Hee-hee. Hey! Rita? We're going over! Well, do something! No! Whoa. No, no, no, no! Gotcha! Au revoir, ma cherie! Take your flippers off me! I have triumphed! You stupid English, with your Yorkshire puddings and your chips and fish, you thought you could defeat Le Frog? Un... ...deux... trois! Nibble for your life! My belt, I think. You rodents! Goodbye, Jammy, me old mate. Whoa! Whee! We're okay, we're okay, we're okay, we're okay. Try opening your eyes! Hold up, hold up. We're over Kensington! Yeah, only a terrifying 900-foot drop between you and a nice comfortable bed. - Where's your house then? - Right, now. Let me see... Uh, Inverness Gardens, Vicarage Gate, Kensington High Street. Try and go left. That's it. Now go right. Yeah. Oh, this is gonna be tricky. Oh, yeah, and everything else has been a piece of cake. All right, here we go. Uh, 45, 47, 49... now! Ow. Well, I've had softer landings. We did it. I'm home. The crew of the Jammy Dodger survives! Ha ha! - Yep. - Oh... Rita? Oh, oh, of course. I'm such an idiot. Oh, the Dodger. Wasn't your fault, Rod. Quite an adventure, though, wasn't it? Oh, Rita, I am so sorry. But I think I might be able to cheer you up. Ta-da! As promised, the Kensington jewels. A genuine star-cut ruby. It's just beautiful! And the best part? Unbreakable. I don't know what to say. You think it will be enough? I mean, to take care of your family? And maybe this could be the Jammy Dodger Mark Il. Well... I suppose this is it. Thank you... for the lift. You're welcome. - Roddy? - Yes. I don't suppose you'd have time to give me a quick tour? Of course. I'd love to meet your family. Ah... Hello? Hello, hello, hello? Anybody home? Wouldn't you know it? Just when you need 'em, all out, every one of them. Wait. Wait, wait, wait. - What is that? - Oh, that. Um... that's my... That's my master bedroom. - It's a cage. - No! No, no, it's not, actually. Then why the lock and bars? Well, it's, that's my, um... home security system. So much to see, so little time to see it in. - Shall we? - Roddy. You're all alone up here, aren't you? Goal! - Who's that? - Um... That would be... my brother! Wow, what a game! I can't believe it! He shoots! He scores! Back of the net! Group hug. - Oh, hello. - Rita, this is, uh... Rupert. - What? - Rupert, this is Rita. She's been so looking forward to meeting my brother. Uh... Obviously, there's not a huge family resemblance. I rather got the brains and... Well, actually, I got the looks too, but we're very close, aren't we, Rupert? Well, how time flies when you're having fun! Still, on with the tour, shall we? - Hello, Sid. - Hello, Rita. - How's your dad? - Better, yeah. Thanks for asking. Rupert? What was that all about? Come here, you poor little thing. Look at his little face. You ever seen anything so pathetic? Brothers? All Mr. Lonely has got is a couple of dolls and a little wheel to run around in his cage. Oh, this is too sweet! What a loo-hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo-ser! Oh... It's okay, Roddy. Okay? Look at this place, Rita. Look at my home. It's a palace! I can do whatever I want whenever I want to. I mean, I'd say that's a little more than okay, wouldn't you? I mean, what do I need a family for? What do I need friends for? I'm sorry, but if you have everything you need, then... I really have to get going. I have a serious infestation to deal with. I'll say goodbye, then... Roddy St. James... of Kensington. ♪ Lonely ♪ ♪ I'm Mr. Lonely ♪ ♪ I have nobody ♪ ♪ For my own ♪ Only ten minutes left till halftime. What an amazing match this has been... Come on, England! Oh, this is fantastic! A rare attack here by Germany, but it comes to very little. Come here, bro! Rupert's missing his Rodsy-Wodsy. Here, have a cheese puff. Have another. Here you go. No! Duh. You're supposed to eat them. Move... over. - What? - Move over! I'll take some of that. Word of advice, mate. Take it easy with the drink, seriously, or you'll never make it till halftime. What did you say? Oh, the bathroom. I'm waiting till halftime. I don't want to miss any of the game. Halftime. He's waiting till halftime! Those floodgates won't hold forever, you know! No! Not the master cable! What do you want it for anyway? Oh, you'll see, come the World Cup Final this afternoon. Half... time. Half... time. Of course. That's The Toad's plan! That's why he needs the cable! When everyone goes to the toilet, the whole city will be flushed away! - Come with me. - Wha... No! But what about the game? And what a game it is! Oh, a nasty fall there for Ray Bowers, the big center. Can you see all right, Fergus? Yes, thanks, Mum. Where's your helmets? Which one's the quarterback? Pick up the ball! Pick up the ball! Oh, these Brits don't know the first thing about football. Enjoy your last moments, you egregious vermin. I've got Rita, boss! I've got Rita! Get off me, you lab reject! Ha! You missed. Ow. Ah, Rita. It's so good of you to return the cable. Bonjour. Hey! At last! It's mine! Just take it. Let there be light! Please don't flush me, Roddy! I can't survive down there! I've gone soft! Sid, I want you to flush me. I'm going back. - Back? - Rita's in terrible danger. Everyone's in terrible danger! Now, you like it here, don't you? Oh, yes, Roddy. I like it here very much. And if I leave you, will you be good to Tabitha, the little girl that looks after me? I'll be as good as gold to her, Roddy. And I will be the best pet ever! Then the place is all yours. - Sweet! - Right. Let's get the bubbles going. I've got a big job to do down there. Right away, sir! So long, Sid. So long, Rodnick Saint Something of Someplace or other. Geronimo! And, Io, a chosen one shall come down from above, and he shall be our savoir from the Great Flood! I'm terribly sorry. Just two minutes left till halftime! Incredible! - It's a fantasy start for England. - Rita! England leads Germany by three goals to one. - What an amazing game... - Rita! ...this is turning out to be! The grand opening. And the referee again has to bring play to a halt. Rita! Fans for the fans! Get your England fans here. Pied Piper lures thousands to their death! Read all about it. Balloons! Rita! - Rita! - Roddy! I'm so sorry. I've been such a fool. You were right about me, about everything. I should've admitted that. I was afraid you wouldn't like me anymore. Do you think we can talk about this after you've rescued me? Of course. There's no time. When that whistle blows and everyone Up Top goes to the toilet, it's gonna flush away the whole city. I know. And my family are all down there. We've got to warn everyone. Stop them! Oh, dear. Whoa! Whitey! I saw an opportunity and I seized it. So you thought you could make a fool of The Toad, eh? You don't need us for that. Oh, you think you're so clever, don't you? Well, I'll be the one laughing when every last revolting rat is flushed away! For I shall repopulate the city... with these! - Eww! - Nasty. - Is this the Glorious Amphibian Dawn, Dad? - Anything for you, my little man. - Can I have a pony? - No. - A puppy? - We'll talk about it. - Can we talk about it now? - No. - Can I have a puppy? - Me too. No, you can't all have puppies! Please! Daddy's working! We need to get downstairs and pull out that cable. How? It's impossible. England is winning. Anything's possible. Help! Turn it off, Whitey! - No! - Huh? - Come on! - They're getting away! Oh. Hi, boss. Whitey! They're biting my bottom! Help! I'm coming, Spike! You fools! Grab them! Top floor, lingerie, housewares, and certain doom! Do I have to do everything myself? There goes the whistle for halftime! We're gonna take a break, but we'll be back in a few minutes. You're too late to do anything! You and your kind are finished! Oh, yeah? Well, come and get us then, you warty windbag. Oh, no! The gate. Back this way! Come on! Rita! If I'm going, you're both coming with me! Just go, Roddy! That's it. Roddy! Stop moving! Come and get me, you big, slimy airbag! Roddy, look out! - Yes! - Ah! Le Frog! Oh. Let's finish this. Yeah, let me go! Goodbye, rat! Rita! Hmm? - Feeling a little tongue-tied? - Impossible! - Toodle-oo. - No! - Wave! Wave! - England! No, giant wave! Please work. Please work. Please work! High five! Oh, yeah. Look! It's Roddy and Rita! Good on you, girl! Hooray for Millicent Bystander! Millicent! Millicent! Millicent! Millicent! You're a hero, Roddy. Big deal. You wretched vermin! I'll make you pay for this! Ah, give it a rest, cousin. And get your kids a puppy. Rita...
