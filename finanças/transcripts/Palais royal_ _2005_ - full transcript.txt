Three rows of pearls roll down our cheeks Rows of pearls or strings of tears Roll in our hearts left to weep Shoot up to the sun, lighting up the sky Your fair-haired angels one day will know That our queen was you What will they do without their mom? And what of us, sitting here alone and dumb? And what of them, full of certainties And what of you, up there in the moon? Why always the same souls? Why take those who do what's right? Why take those who bind us tight? Three rows of tears around your fair neck Why always the same souls? Why take those who do what's right? Why take those who bind us tight? Rows of pearls or... strings of tears ARMELE, I LOVE YOU - Hearts are trumps. - Two no trumps. Armelle, let it rip. Pass. Check out that babe. - Bow-legged. - Yeah, you're right. Wait, let me help. It is heavy. I need my crossword. I'll get it for you. I'd rather do it myself. Armelle's a one-woman senior center! - Can I put it up now? - Go ahead. That's not nice. Stop it. Funny. Armelle, why'd you trump the club? To let you finesse against the king. Never mind. I'm going to take a leak. Ask the slut if she has a crewneck. Crewneck or V-neck? Crew. V-necks are faggy. Yeah, you're right. That's what I have. How is it? I don't get their sizes, or their accents. In the States I have no problem. Even the ten is too big. - A little small? - No, it's great. You're right, I'll take it. Hello, Gilbert Butcher's. Yes, hold on. One second. Of course. What is it with you? You're out of your mind. Are you naked? A bra? Which one? Blue with white polka dots. Laurence, I found a camel one in size 8. - Here. - Great. The chestnut is the last one. They can have one sent over. Only takes 15 minutes. I don't want to wait. We're going shoe-hunting. Hey Mel, got something nice? Laurence found two great ones. - What? - Sweaters. Hang on, let me handle this. I mean we're buying so much. Freebie? No sense of salesmanship. Well, I do. It's a nice view. 80 pounds for Aussie wine. These limeys have some nerve. - The key... - I'm loaded. What can we give them? Chili con carne. No, 8 is too late. 6:30's better! Lend me a pen. You don't do it right. You have to wait for the green light. Quiet! People are sleeping. Titi, scotch? Sure. Laurence... Cherry Schweppes? Yuk. Little dessert? Hysterical. How can you stand him? I'm not sleepy at all. Wish we had a joint. Could you lend me a nightgown? I forgot mine. And I hate sleeping in the nude. I have pajamas. Way too big for me. OK, I'll make do. There we go. I wouldn't dare, with customs. You shouldn't. But no one cares about me. No one cares about Arnaud. If they nabbed Alban, that would be sticky. I can't picture your uptight brother smoking a joint. Watch it, he's the heir to the throne. Titi, did you take my Omega 3? - What's that? - Oh, great. Good stuff. Hey, Mellie! Laurence was such a pain all day. Deep down you like her. Are you naked? I lent Laurence my pajamas. Turn over, my love. - Won't have a son like that. - That's for sure. - Think of your mom. - The hell with her. Come on, be a dear. Just this once. That can't be. My father died in '92. What? But how? Actually, we switched rooms. Have you tried his cell? I can give you the number. I'll take care of it. You can count on me. The fucking light! Andr? died while we were eating out. Andr?... Andr?? Shit. How? Helicopter accident. After a ski trip. His guide, too. They're both dead. Died instantly. Only Alban got out unscathed. I have to tell Arnaud. What's his room number? Is it 505? No, we're 505. Was our old room 506? It's across the hall. Would you go? Why should I? It's a woman's thing. When Rex died, you told the kids. Not the same thing. It is, sort of. He's not my old schoolmate. Am I waking you? Yes. What's the matter? They called my room. Reception has you in our room, that's why. Cut to the chase. Your dad had a health issue in a chopper. What issue? I don't know. That's all they told me. You're to go to the military airport. Is it serious? Yeah, I guess. A little. I really don't have any details. But Alban's fine. I spoke to an English lady, then someone else... No baggage? We left close friends behind. They'll handle all that. Hope it's not serious. And that it's not permanent. He's so athletic. Well... I hope your journey is as pleasant as possible in the circumstances. Thank you for coming out tonight. This ruins a weekend. No, really... You're very kind. Arnie, give me your passport. That's not necessary. Well then, unfortunately, we will be seeing each other on Saturday. What's on for Saturday? Well... the interment. Not easy being the eldest. Taking over the family business... He had so much left to teach me. Didn't Daphne come? If you're hungry, boys... gentlemen, there are some refreshments in the pantry. Sandwiches, crackers. Thank you, Marie-Pierre. She still has that wart. I'd forgotten. She wasn't so stiff when she brought my snack. Daphne couldn't make it? I'm going to the pantry. I haven't eaten since the accident. I'd better have my bandage changed. You see, Armelle, even at 62, he was still my baby. Of course. He was so cute, so supple. You could twist him all around. Made his little poop every day at the same time, like clockwork. How nice. Mom, didn't Daphne come? She left him last week. No one knows it yet. I thought she'd be back, but... I hear she's found someone new, in Spain. She seemed perfect. What can I tell you? He never could keep them. And the nose won't help matters. Would it be possible, Arnaud, to meet with you about 10 AM... Monday in the little anteroom behind the smoking room? Oh, sure. No problem. Is 10 too early for you, Arnaud? No, not at all. Praise the Lord. While, in private, Queen Eugenia grieves at the fallen king's side, a few subjects of the crown, stricken by last night's news, have very discreetly come to lend her their support and express their love for one who, over 35 years, understood them so well. King Andr? died in an accident last night at 8:10 after climbing one of the mountains he loved so well. Exiting the royal residence now is Alban, very close to his father, also at the accident and miraculously saved by the sandwiches on his lap. This discreet, thoughtful prince is prematurely called to succeed his father. Alban, our future king. Here's his younger brother, Arnaud, his wife, Armelle, with her father, Count van de Couque. A family, a nation, a kingdom stricken with the loss of a beloved monarch. At St Eloi Cathedral funeral preparations are underway. The Cathedral will welcome leaders from the world over come to pay their respects to this private man, this good and simple king. Come to Grandpa. That's enough. Come wash, you dirty little girl. Come to Grandpa. Come take a 'ath with Grandpa in the 'athtu'. Or Grandpa will 'eat you. See? I told you, she can't say "b" anymore. Her teacher sent me. I thought it was silliness. For starters, you'd better keep B?rang?re on weekends. Even before treatment. She can visit her grandparents, but only for lunch. Tell them she goes swimming on Saturday evenings now. I think it's better, for now in any case. Can they visit? Excuse me. Your prison visit! Little Chris is here with his inhaler. B?rang?re was 25 minutes late! Dylan's dad brought you a ham. Should I give it to Karima? Christine, it's pork. Oh, that's right. Hi. Oh, right, I get it. Let's not waste time. So that's how it's going to be? Seven years of geopolitics, summers in college instead of reading comics. What did I ever do? Not my fault Daphne's sunbathing on that idiot's yacht. I loved her. Why didn't she come back? A future king! Get a grip. You can't be seen like this. Go hide. I'm still asleep. Signing papers at 10 AM! No time to get my drawers on. I don't deserve this! Honey, sit down and listen to Ren?-Guy. Dear Arnaud, despite the sorrow we all share today, as you know, we must think of your father's succession. Your brother Alban has always had some trouble retaining his hypothetical fianc?es. We thought it best that you, however unprepared you may be, leap into the breach and take the place which had been meant for him. - Me? - Yes, you, Arnaud. The Charter, dating from Calixte I, is quite clear on this point. "Let none claimeth by any right the crown and scepter's might "if no petticoat be in sight." It's crystal-clear. It happened once before, in 1458, at the death of Eloi the Vigorous. The younger Alibert replaced the unbetrothed Ambroise. Alas, in that case, the kingdom was the worse for it, but we are quite confident, praise the Lord, that won't be the case with you. We're certain. I have no doubt. Some remembrances of your father. I couldn't even look. One thing. I've heard a rumor... that there's been a little... marijuana going around your home. You understand that, from now on... Oh right, but it's not me. That's Armelle. I'll talk to her. Fine. So lovely, these strokes and flourishes... What are those glasses? I'm 6-0 in the left eye. I've had trouble reading. I need glasses now. Stinks of wine. I drove a bum to the pool. He slept in the car while I was shopping. You're driving bums to the pool now! Not enough with stutterers, jail visits, idiot immigrants, and not locking your car? Enough bull! "Kind" doesn't rhyme with "cretin"! We have to talk. I had a totally big meeting with Mom and Ren?-Guy. Much better, thanks. Since I started calligraphy, I've found a certain serenity. It does me the world of good. Do some every day? Not every day. Yesterday, I did a big P. So relaxing. Getting back to the point, I'd like this to go quickly. Your little dentist job has to go. - Speech therapist. - Right, sorry. You'll have no time for that. It must take concentration. Yes, of course. Arnaud has the right stuff. I don't say that because we get along so well. What can I say? It's this damned charter. I was glad Arnaud reacted so well. It can't be easy. It can't be easy for Alban. Yes, but what can you do? With his extra testicle... I've been honest. I always warned his girlfriends in advance. Who knows why they run? My "three strands" are yours. I had them when the boys were born. Still perfect. Pearls come in handy. Must wear them, or they die. Here, try it on. There's a safety catch. Wait, let me help. You might touch up your hair. Just so it looks a little tidier. You're fine in your way. Maybe something neater. That's nice. Very nice. Of course, not with green, but... Speaking of green, I hope you've completely stopped... You know... the dope smoking. I'm known for my casual style, but I don't like that much. Oh, and I found this in Health magazine. A diet for having boys. I copied it. It's supposed to work. I never had any problems. Eat salty foods, no dairy. Or very little. Read it later. Rudy! Flopsy! Sorry. They always do that with strangers. Ren?-Guy, come in. Well, Armelle. We've filled your schedule for the next 3 months. Our apologies for minor changes to be made, with your input, on a daily basis. We've canceled your patients. From now on, you will have much more amusing things to do. Blow. Harder, honey. Harder. With the queen, our future sovereigns Arnaud and his wife, Armelle. Arnaud, unemployed, polo enthusiast, will succeed Andr?, replacing Alban, sadly unwed when tragedy struck. The coronation will take place after the mourning period. Alban's still not married. Why? I don't know. It's my pleasure to introduce His Royal Highness Prince Arnaud, who will honor us by inaugurating the Jean Bourdieu Library, which his father would be proud to see completed. Your Highness. To remember Jean Bourdieu is to evoke a monument. Who better than this great poet could lend his name to this place of culture, of discovery and reading? For a book is a promise. There are 300,000 promises now awaiting the patronage of, we hope, a large public. In this time of new tech... nologies, when our nation has jumped on the internet bandwagon while in motion, what better than a book to stop time and travel through centuries? However, rather than long speeches, allow me to immediately unveil the plaque and baptize this new seat of learning, this new jewel in our crown. Majesty! Over here. - Very nice. - Great. - Like this? - Very good. That's good. He wanted me off the grass. Dad's not angry. But those pictures are for his work. Dad works? Yes, he does now. Let's go, girls! Your turn! Could you smile just a little? More laid back. More natural. Yeah, almost. Better. Got a pastel color? Maybe something fresher? This isn't fresh? Your husband's right. Good thinking. I'll go see in your closets. I'd rather go. I need you in the picture. Don't move. Weekend, my doggie. Here, Weekend. Good boy. Very nice. I got the same shot in France with the Sarkozy boy. Nice. Move, you're blocking the steak. Looks overcooked. No, it's fine. Very homey. But could Madam look like you think it's good? Like you can't wait to taste it. What are you doing? It's for my own pleasure. No way, quit it right away. No second camera. I got the exclusive. They're my friends. Forget it. I can erase them, it's digital. Great. Do it. I found a pen. Take some notes. You'll have to sign treaties. Don't look at me. Just work, like usual. Armelle! Get some supplies from the closet. Coming. Here, there are sporty ones too. Armelle, office supplies! Folders, files. I'll put them back properly. Sorry. - Mistake from my "Big Blue" period. - It's erasable. We do incredible stuff now. I erased the mustache of the woman who won the lottery. We can whiten the lady's teeth. Simple as pie. Really? Great. Shake your bootie, we're late. Not shooting? No, there'll be thousands of photographs tonight. - I got what I need. - Oh, OK. Be good with Bricka. After dinner, you can watch Bugs Bricka... Bunny. Sorry. That's OK. Soup all over it! Unbelievable. - Not very deft, is she? - Sure isn't. You're great, Arnaud, really. Very sweet, with the girls. The steak in the kitchen, very nice. Very homey. You should be careful. The detergent on the window sill. Anyway... I like the office. Handsome, dignified. No, not at all. You're concentrating on work. No, you're just fine. Could I speak to Armelle? I have two or three tips. Armelle, it's Mom. Hello. How are you? Fine, thanks. No, of course you're not. You fixed your heating problem? Yes, sure. I don't remember. I'll get it. It's on Arnaud's desk. Here it is. Page 38? Right. Yes. Yes, of course. More smile. Oh, page 42. Yes, right. I saw that. The reporter... The photographer was there. More vases. You're right, it's more lively. Yes, he looks good in glasses. No problem. You too. Let me see. Your Majesty, have some more blood sausage. A treat in the morning! Your Highness. Made entirely from local produce. Very good. You won't have some beer? Thanks anyway, but I only drink water. But my wife could have some. Tasted this one yet? Finish your glass, Your Majesty. Never mix. Bottoms up. Try this one. More malt, but less alcohol content than the last one. Delicious. Arnaud! Arnaud! Arnaud! Gentlemen... Well done. On your mark, get set... Jump! Higher! Lower! Right! Practice for next year. Just picture it. On her back in the mud with her bouquet and scarf. Right, I forgot. She was blindfolded. What a disaster. Ever hear of "Bite the Biscuit?" It's famous! More up north, but really, Armelle. For her first time out, nice going, Princess. That isn't nice. Ass up, like a mud wrestler! Titi, ice cream? Looks bad, but I'm hungry. Not me. I have to drop ten pounds for my coronation. At the palace, I'll have a gym installed. Titi, roll us a joint? - You packed? - Can't find the bathing suits. We leave at 9:30. That idiot Henri- Louis got me an 8:45 for UVs. Yeah, right. That's too early. There's a little girl crying. "Omasoosee." "Omasoosee." What a disaster. No ear for the lingo. He's very honored that you're here. Very honored. This aquarium was constructed in 1955. Half a century. Fish... Even if you don't understand, you could be a little nicer. The guy in the green suit. Not the stupid interpreter. That just isn't done. Fine, alright. Look at me! It's fun, nice. I can't wear this to dinner. You can't change, it's a gift. Look at me. You don't have the whole shebang. You have to make an effort. You don't seem to realize what's at stake here. I have diplomatic priorities. A coronation coming. So if I'm dragging this dead weight along... Kissing everyone hello and giving your gifts to chambermaids, won't cut it. It'll come. I'm learning. I don't like costumes. Or fish. Or flowers. I'm not picking that up. We asked you to come in as we heard disturbing things about your Sri Lanka trip. As you can imagine, we have contacts the world over. Arnaud's call earlier only confirmed what we read over the wire. Everything has gone quickly. Perhaps I haven't taken time to explain the very basics of your new position. Some people adapt naturally. Some don't. All gifts, so generously given, must be shown and proudly worn, whatever your personal preferences. You are the image of our whole realm, whether traveling abroad or in your own car. And lastly, don't forget to use the favorable days of your cycle to get started on a future prince, keenly awaited by the whole kingdom. If you warn me in advance, I might even clear part of your schedule on those days. That's all, Armelle. I think that does it. Both doors lead to the same place. Take your pick. And Armelle... Smile. Don't forget to smile. You might get a tulip named for you. You'll see, it's nice. A crate of bulbs for you. Tulips don't smell, Armelle. You did have Marc do your hair? A tall blond with a red mustache? That's him. Strange. For this afternoon, you should change tops. Seems silly, but people get bored. You can't imagine how attentive they are. How lucky we are to be outdoors with the flowers. Poor Arnaud in a brick factory in Khubourg. - Turn over. - Who do you think I am? Ask Gilbert to plant them. Scratchy sheets! Didn't my shot numb you? Dumb shit. Just need a jacket. I'll get it for you. The white one, or the beige one with gold buttons? Or maybe pants. It's chilly. I'll get them. Don't bother, Bricka. I'll find something. Don't forget your panties. Last time I had to hide them. I'm very happy today. Let me tell you why. For years I have led a grass-roots struggle for renewed support of that simple act of giving blood. That's why I asked Princess Armelle, Her Royal Highness, to come lend a hand. It didn't take much persuasion for her to set an example by giving a drop of her royal blood. I hasten to add, if anyone was wondering, it is free. And you even get a little snack. I tasted it, very good. Thank you, Armelle. Up it comes... A little smile? Well done, Armelle. I'm not hungry. You should eat. We took a lot. Really, a pint is a lot. In a half hour we're having cake. What cake? We're expected at the senior center for tea. It's not in my schedule. It was planned well in advance. Anyway, they can't wait. You'll see, you'll brighten their day. Her Royal Highness, Princess Armelle! I'll clear a path to that asshole. I'm starving. Mrs. Victor. Mr. Cordier, former diplomat. Our eldest, Jeannette. Over there, Mr Secretary. Some refreshments? Come this way. She won the prize! The crown! Long live the Queen! Pictures! A little smile. There, very nice. Perfect. You can start eating. Jeannette, how are you? Fine. You haven't had your drink. I'm loaded. We got it, let's go. You have TV? It's great now, terrific. All those new programs. This is a model establishment. Lovely. Sorting and recycling. - Wonderful! Paper with... - Glass with glass. Paper with paper. I hope you all sort your personal trash. Very important for ecology. Shit! I'm sorry, Mr. Secretary. I don't know how they got in. There's a receptionist. I thought that was over. They always miss me, but they got her. Attacking a woman like that. Ugly, very ugly. No, let me. After all, I am a doctor. She hit her head, I heard it. Shit. - Nothing. - Nothing? Help me turn her over. Princess, princess. Armelle? - She moved! - Indeed. Are you sure? I'm expected for dinner, but to put your mind at ease, we could pop by my friend Stoffer's clinic for a quick X-ray. Gum. Good thinking. We usually keep some in the car, right? But today, we're out of ammo. I'd love one. No. Pathetic! With that cardboard crown. Sure there's no copies of this spectacle? Absolutely, Eugenia. I went personally to this senior center, the visit to which, by the by, was not on her schedule. They brought me a poor old buzzard who, praise the Lord, gave me the camera. I did, of course, leave him a small reward. The papers would have a field day. She is such a twit. It's a first. In ten centuries, no one ever touched the royal family. Between you and me, I think people don't much like her. She's just not popular, not... I think we'd better whittle down her schedule. For remaining obligations, keep her on a tight leash. Do you still sell this item? Yes, of course. We have for years. It's a Swiss company, a favored supplier. I'd like the same ones. We've just received the new color line. Turquoise, little ladybugs. It's younger. - A nice change. - No, the same ones. Prefer the classics? So that was... size L? - No, size M. - Fine. No, actually, size S is better. I'll show you one. But you'll see it's teeny-weeny. Unless, of course, the gentleman is very slender. There. Perfect. Fine. It's a good item, sells well. A classic. Good choice. The 15th looks good. I'll have a little time then. Thank you. Nice meeting you. Mind the wire. I was interrupted. For the video, we'll see. Don't mention it. Thanks, bye. Coming to the match? No, my trainer is coming. - Really? - Yeah. Coming. Relax the shoulders. Like that, Bruno? Don't arch. Straighten up. Very good, Princess. Right. And left. Like that is better. No, that's tense. Let's look at the buttocks. Lean over. That's all very tense. Straighten up. See you tonight. What is it with me? I suddenly feel all fuzzy and weird I feel sort of like A little bird whispered in my ear What is it with me today, I'm in love with my wife! Like on our first date I'm in love with my wife! I want to kiss her I need to caress her And I'm going to take her on a vacation Like newlyweds Maybe we got married too young I needed to do what a man has to do I've tired of all my conquests I now know she's my one true love The cat, the dog, the cat. No, the cat! Now the abs. On your back, legs up, ankles. I push, you try to resist. You think I can? It's up to you. I'm going to take your pulse. Bruno! Nice going, old chap! Tomorrow about five? Wednesday is Tiphaine's birthday. 15 kids and no Titi. Laurence, this is important. When can you? You tell me. No, not on the phone. Why so damn mysterious? Laurence, I have three thirsty horses here. Thursday. At your place. No, not my place. Thursday, at five, under the chestnut tree. What are you looking at? I'm not looking. Sure? There. I told Delvaux not to alter it or I wouldn't back him. The Donge redistricting was a complete panic. He was surprised I knew. After the Vanbergue thing, what a nerve! Bunch of cretins. I tried not to rub it in. That asshole is so sensitive. You know, we eat too much at those inaugurals. I must've gained 10 pounds. I can't get into my boxers. So I see. Your Chinese masseur. Tell me, Bricka, did you eat tripe? - No, why? - No reason. You sure you want a second scotch? Let me see your dress again. Coming. Keep an eye on her. Let's avoid ridicule tonight. Don't worry. I'm checking. I never knew cream tart made hair grow. I use it daily. Don't make me laugh. Not easy to loosen the two Pokemons up. After the '94 fiasco, we owed them this. Alban, still into classical music? The medals go on the left. Do you see what I see? What do we do? Figure it out, big boy. Campai! Very refreshing, actually. Boy, was I tired last night. I don't get it. I'm awake now though. Feel that? Watch the hair, please. Sorry. That's alright. We can't find our Kinder eggs. We looked all over. Bricka put them on the table. I don't know where they are. Keep looking. You'll find them. Lay off. Your mail. Eaten any garlic cheese recently? - No, why? - No reason. Dr. Lecoutre will show you the way. Could you let go of my arm? Here. Visitors, Mr. Coutard. Ren?-Guy, half a bowl left. Small spoonfuls. He can hardly open his mouth. Well, I think I'll get some coffee. We have our whole lives to drink coffee. One last spoonful? Oh, isn't he cute? Hello there. There! Armelle, sign the visitors' book when Prince Arnaud has finished. There. "With love man can do anything." "Maye thiss space helpe many finde health who were sick." I got your coat. Lots of people waiting outside. No, I think I'll... Yeah, right. It's warm out. No, let me speak to the editor. This is important. Hello, sir. My name is Marie- Ange Dor?. I'm a shopkeeper. In my neighborhood, I often saw Prince Arnaud with a woman who isn't his wife. Yes. Since you seem interested, the womans name is Laurence De Beck. L-a-u-r-e-n-c-e, as in Laurence. New word: "D-e". New word: "B..." No, "B". "E-c-k". I don't know if it's helpful, but you can check where she goes. You'll see what you find. Here is her address: 48 Route de Brouckante. Yes, 48. A big, redbrick house. To the right of the plaster figurine shop. Don't mention it. If you like, I also have her license plate. It's not easy for me. It's the only way. For you as well. No, please don't cry. You'll make me cry too. There, there. It's over now, all over. Laurence: Our Camilla! So one day we can go back to what was then, so tomorrow may be yesterday again. So one day we can go back to what was then, so tomorrow may be yesterday again. Great! Come out. That last one... By far the best. Bravo! Major goosebumps. I was listening, it was perfect. I could do another one. Wasn't it a little neutral? No, really. We'll play it for you. Sure, let's play it back. After all you've been through, it was really nice of you to come at all. Hats off to you, hon. - Great. - Want tea? Princess, what was your reaction? That duet to support brumopathy - why didn't you cancel? Do you feel betrayed by Laurence? Did Arnaud confess? Will you welcome the Norwegian royals later today? Can you save your marriage? I'm focused on protecting my babies. I was leaving her. Yeah, right. You can see that in the photo. I'd just told her it was over. She was crying. I hugged her to console her. Tell your daughters that. It is their dad in the woods with their godmother, dry leaves stuck on his ass. Majestic! Did Mom call to say you were handsome, concentrating, very professional? With that, a divorce would be a cinch. No, don't. This is so silly. "No crown, no scepter's might with no petticoat in sight." Tell me what you want me to do. What do you want me to do? For starters, stop spitting in my ear. I don't know, ask Laurence to marry you. Laurence De Beck, n?e Coignard, bathmat manufacturer, married, two kids. No good. Give me one more chance, I beg you. Get a grip. Look. The two Neutrogenas are smiling at you. Arnaud sucks! Poor Arnaud, king of the forest. You're in deep poo now! I like you picking us up, Mom. I like it, too. Bricka always gives me my snack right away. We'll have a feast at home. Alright, cool! But that's not the way home. Through the garden, it's nicer. More splendid. Your Highness. Picking up Princesses Constance and Louise? I get my kids at school, like any mom. A mom and a woman who forgave her husband to protect her family. You don't think, you just act, you move on. I have two daughters. I think I've kept them safe. With lots of love, that's all. A mother, a woman, a citizen more and more active on the domestic front, helping the poor. I try to act, in my own little way. I've decided to launch "Poundcake for the Needy Day." If each of us made one poundcake... - It's so easy: 4 eggs, flour, butter, sugar - the world would be a better place. Also... Well, now's not the time. Please, Princess. Go ahead. Since you're here... We have a very beautiful palace, but it's always closed. So I've organized an open house on November 15th from 8 AM to 10 PM. I wanted to give people back some of what's theirs. Thank you very much. No, don't mention it. Armelle, Armelle! Your gym instructor has just arrived. Have him wait, be right there. Bricka, did you eat spoiled salmon? No, why? No reason. Come on, ten more. You like keeping me waiting? What am I, a salesman? No, Bruno. I had a couple of things to do. So are we meeting at lkea on Wednesday at 4? I have my son that day. I don't see him much. Loosen those adductives. Lift your thighs. Like that. That's good. There. Got a lighter? I think so. OK, come over here. What is this? Hold it tight. I'll count to ten. Walk and don't drop it. Don't drop it. Princess! OK, let's put it back in. Hold it tight. Bruno, it's hard. Look! A secret passage! Captain Hook's treasure! It's huge in here! - What's this? - I don't know. Great! The stroller in the begonias. Where's Mr. Gibon? I told him to stay in the garden, dammit! Why did she organize this damned stupid open-house? Ridiculous masquerade! She did catch us unawares. From now on, as long as I'm alive, the palace will be forever closed to the public! It is unpleasant, I agree. Praise the Lord, we're safe here. Look, it's open. This is gorgeous. This is private. Isn't it open house today? - The queen! - Where? Hello. Welcome. So weird to see you here! Watch your ice cream. That's silk. It's delicate and old. Can we take a picture with you? My hair's untidy. You look fine like that. Don't stand there by yourself. There's room for you. Excuse me. Excuse me, where is the mens room? Half a block down on the left, there's a caf? with full amenities. That hag is busting our chops. It's ringing off the hook. There's not a single Armelle mug left in stock. There are just two chipped plates left. They say they might recycle the Arnaud ones. Let's face it. Since the Laurence affair... sales have slipped. I've been thinking maybe it would be best to push the coronation back just a little. What a sucker, getting caught like that. We were, praise the Lord, always more discreet. And less watched. Let them have tee-shirts. We've done that, but we're running low. We reprinted some jigsaw puzzles last week. They're sold out. The watches and spoons were due yesterday, but the ship has been held up in Amsterdam. It's a customs problem. Nothing I can do. Tell your wholesalers to watch it. The wipes and the margarine, I think, is a bit much. Well, Eugenia, it does butter the kingdom's bread. We don't need that. The queen was talking crap. She said the maid heard them make the appointment. It's only ten after four. They played like shit last night. After two penalties, I went to bed. With all the money they make! Look! The princess's car. And the guy. Right on time. Too far. I need a longer lens. - The entrance would've been better. - Yeah, right! In the open, with our big guns! - Owen. - Yes? Back in a half hour. Don't hurry! This is cool! Colorful, inexpensive. I want to buy it all! Quiet. We're not here for that... Where are you taking me? Yesterday afternoon, the princess lent her support to the medical team of "One Waffle, One Vaccine." The princess came despite the heatwave in southern Bazombi?. More proof of her generosity and her commitment. Budget Minister Louis Neveld today defended his new bill... What good is this? If I want to see her kiss a kid, I'll buy a newspaper. Really, Your Highness... There were two of us. I brought a friend, for back-up. Putting a lamp into her trunk. Sell it to This Old House. It's not what I wanted. I couldn't just ask them... Sorry to be vulgar... to start necking in the parking lot. It's not you, Queenie, but maybe the maid gave you a bum tip. - It happens. - I haven't got all day. Here's half of your fee. Which is quite enough. Thanks anyway. You're lucky it's Christmas soon. Everything Happens Before 60 I'm going back to bed. Coming? I'm reading. Should I put my little man here? No, darling, it's not great. What do you think? I'll make a better one, with more red. Don't bother. We have enough decorations. Real balls are prettier, right? Yes, they are, Constance dear. Mom, remember when you were nice? Not now. Go brush your teeth. What a beautiful view. Although it's a lot colder on the chairlift. Mind you, modern clothing is so advanced. These gloves stop you getting frostbite. I see why you don't like the J-bar, with your little problem... with your particularity. With your extra testicle the bar must get in the way. - Must hurt. - What are you talking about? I didn't mean to offend. We all have something. I have a beauty mark behind my ear to live with. I knew a girl in school with two anuses. Must've been complicated. I wonder what became of her. Nice girl. V?ronique Gonel... Sorry for harping on about it, but I don't understand. Relax, you can't tell by looking at you. It's not like you wear a sign. You'll find a girl who loves you, who won't bother counting. Where did you hear this? I think your mother told me, I can't remember. Yes, it was your mother. I guess she was protecting you by telling your girlfriends. I don't believe it. Must be plenty of men on the slopes with 3 nuts who have wives and kids. Here we are. Thank heaven for those Italians or I'd still be up there, suffering in the snow. When I saw them, I was so relieved. These Italians are very nice. Always very elegant. I never liked cell phones, but it changed my mind. Pass me a brioche. With blueberry jam? That's kind of you. Don't be sad, son. It isn't serious. I'll be in a cast 3 weeks. I'll use the time for calligraphy. I have to catch up. Could I watch, Grandmother? If you're good. Hot water never works here. Amazing. Arnaud, in this light, you look like Ren?-Guy. It's incredible. Yes, you're right, Armelle. I noticed it when he was born. Don't be mad. He's handsome. I don't agree. Where do you get these ideas? It's snowing. It has been since three this afternoon. They changed the time for midnight mass. I liked it at nine. Better for the kids. Much better. Much better... One new message Merry Christmas! From Bruno Your little Jesus has room in my inn Look, it's Santa Claus. It's me! Honey, they'll be here in 2 minutes. Go hide. By the way, your grandma's present is in the fridge. Hurry up. They're... Alban, where are the gifts? No gifts this year. And no Santa Claus. Alban, go hide. The girls are coming. No, I won't hide. It's all over. What did you say to keep me from reigning, from marrying, being happy? Whatever do you mean? Drinking champagne with nothing in your belly. At least have a slice of bread. So I'll be silent again! I'm not drunk. I know what I'm saying. Now I know why every girl left me. Make me out a freak. Great idea. Didn't you see the one time you changed my diaper? Too busy with Ren?-Guy, taking care of Arnie, the love child. I knew it. I figured it out! First Christmas without poor dad. You snuck around behind his back. Maybe you arranged the accident to kill us both, and crown Arnaud! How Christian! How nice! I had time to think it through during mass. I spent my childhood in Switzerland, eating Swiss cheese, while Arnie in his mommy's skirt never did homework, his 3 brain cells wired on marijuana! While I slaved in universities, all for nothing! No, I don't have three testicles! No! And I'll prove it! Don't, my dear! Grandma believes you. The king-to-be in the woods while his wife works for charity. You ruined me. I had no chance. Lies, theatrics... Old cow! Selfish bitch, you got what you wanted! That's our mother! Shut up, bastard. Only your glasses come from Dad! Calm down. Take my hanky. Give me the bottle. I'm loaded. That's not Santa, it's Alban. They're not worth getting so upset about. It's not worth the pain. You're too sensitive and they're so heartless. You rest, I'll bring you some turkey. If I were you, I think I'd write a book. Sure, with all you know. - Think so? - Of course. Calm down. Take deep breaths. Your mother really does tell tall tales. Watch him jump over the fence. OK, all this in the garbage. I see. - What do you see? - No, nothing. Touch mom's phone - I'll tell. - Give me that. - No. Give me that. Mom'll smack you. She won't - I'll smack her. - Girls, up to your rooms. - Why? I have an errand to run. Alright. I recentered your energy. You might be tired tonight. Have some herb tea and wear socks to bed. Not very sexy for Prince Arnaud, but it's for the best. Your phone. Should I get it? Not mine. I left it home. Must be mine. Excuse me. A grain of rice is unstuck. Excuse me, yes. That's normal. Pancreatic meridian reaction. It shows the point was adequately stimulated. Do you have enough cellular lotion? Do you have enough lotion? - Where were you? - I need tea. Does 90% fat ring a bell? I don't get it. Well I do! Your cell phone. - You forgot it. - You called? Bruno did. Five times. You were dynamite yesterday. He wants to punish you good. Working out is great. Firm up your pussy while I gorge on your 40% crap! And Alban says thank you. He's got 50 pages written already. The title is "Dethroned" or "Naked King." He's not sure which. This remind you of anything? It's for you. Won't change you back, but it'll do me good. You're crazy! Crazy! You'll wake my girls. Poor little things looking for their chocolates while their bitch of a mother ate them on the sly and stashed the surprises under the bed! - Sweet Armelle, my ass! - Help! And the day winds up with the Tulip Ball. Armelle has scarlet fever and can't attend. Get well soon. Thanks. Hey, hon. Sleep well? Here's some vanilla tea. Fatia made us pastries. She's a mother to us. I won't have her on the balcony. I won't say it again! It's my birthday - I decide! I said she had scarlet fever. I couldn't give a royal fu... Sorry, Arnaud, but after what you told me... We don't need her. Armelle, Armelle! She doesn't have scarlet fever. Well? Nothing. Not even a faint hope? Ren?-Guy, you must've botched it! I even said that, for her, we were redoing the gold leaf on the King Anselme carriage, last used in 1740. I ran out of arguments. She clammed up and gave me a look to kill. I gave up the ghost. Next thing you know, we'll be a republic! It isn't that bad. It is! After the excerpts from Alban's book, that'll be next! There's talk of slashing half our budget! The Prime Minister actually phoned me at 7:15 AM, just after my croissant! He even hinted that if she didn't come, it would be... A revolt. No. A revolution! A real big, bloody mess. Our last resort, in these dire times, is for you to ask her yourself, personally, in person, Eugenia. Merde! I forgot, she's gone into exile at the home of Maurane, the vocalist. Come in, Lionel. It's open. I said it's open! Push the garbage cans out of the way. Relax, I'm coming. What a jerk! Hello, Your Majesty... Your Highness. Miss. Please come in. Want some java, I mean some coffee? No, thanks. I've had lunch. It's nice here. Not easy to find, but... A group of us bought it. We have a nanny for all the kids. It's cool! Fine. I know Armelle is here. She's upstairs working out. I'll tell her you're here. I have all the equipment. I used it for two weeks. Look. Hello, Armelle. Don't stop on my account. Very becoming outfit. Must be comfortable. Yes, very. I'll come straight to the point. I regret the misunderstandings, these little passing quarrels which, while insignificant, are sadly part of life. Let's let bygones be bygones. Arnaud is sorry for his tantrum. As a favor to me, come to his coronation next week. It was delayed once. We can't put it off forever. I know the "Give Peace A Jump" event is important to you. Very laudable. But perhaps this trip to England could be put off until next year. Historically, we don't adore the English. After all they filched from us in Africa... You could come for an hour. Even a half hour. Fifteen minutes. The compass. The t-square. Sewing scissors. The cat. The dog. The dolphin. The dog again. The heliport. The paved heliport. I said paved. Good. Starting to take. What can we eat? You, I know. That's good, baby. Our viewers should know you didn't want a list of questions in advance. Only natural. But so rare nowadays. The queen is said to be harsh with you and her grandchildren. People say so many things. One must keep them in perspective. True, she's not drawn to children. But she's very keen on her garden, loves her flowers. Much has been made of her stinginess, the thing about the stale chocolate she gave the help for Christmas. And I've heard she has hygiene issues. All that is so petty. She doesn't need that kind of publicity right now. Which is why I wanted some space, as well as not feeling very safe in my homeland... Alban implies as much in the excerpts from his book published last week. So he wrote it. I didn't know. I advised against it. I thought it a bad idea. I try to bring this family together. It's not always easy. After all, they have different fathers. Psychologically, it's more complex. Of course. I can't believe it. May I pinch you? Yes, please do. As you're so close to the people, we have a surprise. Elodie is 18. I found her freezing in the hotel lobby. She wanted to bring you a gift. Really? She spent her savings just to show her love for you. I'm sorry. This is too wonderful. I can't get over it. Poor kid. Hello, Elodie. How does it feel to see the princess in the flesh? It's too great. I'm not used to this. That's a gift of life. If you're free tomorrow, Elodie, come backstage to the jump. Then the two of us can go shopping together as friends. Oh yes, I'm free. Here, it's for you. It's nothing. Just so you think of me when you look at it. Thank you, that's so sweet. Thank you, Elodie. See you later, dear. See you tomorrow. Promise? You see, it's people like these I care about. More so than squabbles over court and power. So many send their love. I get sacks full of mail, adorable musical greeting cards. I wanted to thank people personally here tonight. May I? Of course. Thank you so much. Bitch. Thanks to your growing popularity, the global committee selected you to participate in the second year of a major event, "Give Peace A Jump," which many here see as a great leap for peace. And bungee jumping with you in London will be no less than Pavarotti, Carole Bouquet... The Dalai Lama. Yes, the man. And David Beckham, Brad Pitt... You're the only royal to be chosen, for all you represent. Have you had any special training? I just worked out, some roller blading. Yeah, you worked out. Shut up. Didn't Denise's girl do bungee jumping? The older one? - She's in Australia. - So what? Armelle is so brave. She's very athletic. Pavarotti lost weight. He did the Atkins diet. Are you ready? I wanted to wish you luck. Princess, it's me. It's Elodie. You promised! No baggage? No more at home. I could only find this. Sorry to meet you here twice in so short a time. Hope it's not serious. Or permanent. She's so athletic. Thanks for coming out tonight. This ruins a weekend. Well, it's the least I could do. Unfortunately, we will be seeing each other Saturday. What do I have on Saturday? The queen never appreciated her. Even though Armelle was defending her on TV right before the big jump. She knew way too much. All that crap they feed us: She mistakenly took Pavarotti's bungee and bounced one too many times. Their staff and everyone rigged the bungee beforehand. I know it. God has called you back to the fold. Armelle... Through your grace, your goodness, and your kindness, you gave meaning to the word "love." Armelle, in Celtic, means "princess of the bears." Haven't we all been a bear with her? Let us search inside ourselves, each one of us, deep in our hearts for the bear which may at times be hurtful, even murderous. Struck down in mid-flight, as you gave of yourself, as you jumped for peace... You, who thought always of others, who initiated that great day of open house. The time has come to return to Jesus. Jesus calls to you, "Come, "I need you. "Up here in Heaven too, we need you."
