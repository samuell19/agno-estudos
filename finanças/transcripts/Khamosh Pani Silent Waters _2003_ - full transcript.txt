Of course Surely it's not time to pray yet Almost Fine, but Saleem has a job to finish first All right Well done "At 1030..." "Oh, my darling, don't keep me waiting too long" Put that back - Did you get pickle spices? - I asked Saleem But God knows if he'll remember. His head's in the clouds You've spoilt him rotten. You can't be strict It took so many prayers for so long before he was born. He has no idea I've been here ages I told Ma I'd be late for school, but she kept saying "Do this, do that" Does she suspect something? No She just likes making me work I hate housework.

"Your Saleem is so handsome" I said "Zubeida is very pretty and so spirited" Her eyes sparkle, don't they? I've never noticed I said she was perfect. I couldn't ask for a better... A better what? Someone to help with the chores. An assistant... Really? Zubeida... If you're selling flutes, I'm not interested Any idea what your mother said to mine? I can guess. "That layabout Saleem stops my daughter every day" Can't you ever use your brain? No, that's your job Hurry, Zubeida Five o'clock Baba, grant my son his heart's desire Let's see what the landlord says In the name of Allah...

Athiya Zahid presents the news atone o'clock Islamic law will be introduced... ...within six months Changes, changes and more changes! Mr Rasheed What's happening in Lahore? Everyone accepts the changes. They feel General Zia represents people... ...like you and me I'm not like you. I'm a naive villager and you're a man of politics The question is, whom does General Zia represent? You or me? Hey, Mehboob, hurry up Must I wait here all day? Let him finish. A good job takes time Go on, Mehboob How much longer? Is he giving you a massage or making pickle? Oh Hatâ€œ... ...this is just like General Zia's promise of elections Why does Zia's barber keep asking him about the elections? Why'? Because when Zia hears the word elections'... ...his hair stands on end and it's easy to trim If any official heard about that... ...you wouldn't laugh long True, but that official would need... ...to be informed That's it, sir It's Hadi's turn The young Chaudhry sent for me. I went to see him He says he'll get you a job in Bhatti's shop. His brother-in-laws What kind of job'? Bhatti's opened a shop near the Sikh temple. He needs someone reliable Why didn't you ask me first? Father's pension can't feed a family Do you think I can't earn my own money? What do you plan to do? Anyway, I've given the landlord my word. We can't upset him now I'll end up... ...fetching and carrying It's a start You could save and do up the house. Or buy a piece of land I don't want to farm Then what? Since Partition, Pakistan's existence... ...has angered India - Why is that? - India believes that Pakistan... ...shouldn't have been created Sorry for interrupting, but they just refuse to accept... ...that Muslims and Hindus are two different nations Well said Turn it up It's all politics. What's it to do with us? Pakistan exists. Why harp on about it? Talk about the price of wheat Men shed blood for this country and all you care about... ...is food.

Come on, the professor's waiting The man who fasts will find his sins forgiven Prayer is the key to paradise. Men pray so they can find that key But he who fights a holy war... Allah is great He who wages a holy war has conquered his selfishness and fears This is the greatest service our brave young men can perform Has Allah guided you to wage the holy war'? Our goal is Jihad In 1947, we founded this country... ...in the name of Islam The lines of its borders were drawn in Muslim blood Today... ...33 years later, we want to know Where is the land of the pure? Devilish leaders have plundered my beloved Pakistan See how the Devil has influenced us Sometimes in the form of political parties Sometimes in the guise of obscenities on TV or in films Our honour, our women roam the streets with their heads uncovered Who will protect and keep them? Where is the rule of Islam in whose name we made this country? Where's the young man who'll die to guide his country to the right path? Who will risk his life? I'm asking you Where is that young man? And if you understand the meaning of Islam... If you know what Islam means, then come forward... ...and defend Islam He who is a true Muslim... ...will be rewarded in this world and the next A true Muslim! - What does Pakistan mean? - There is no God but Allah - Let me massage your legs - It's OK Let me. It'll be nice Where did I go wrong, Shabbo? No one dies without asking that question. It's the way of the world The world has strange ways It's all strange. Our children live their own lives Saleem can't be on your lap for ever. Let him go Who can we call our own if not our children'? What else do we have? I have no one else That's not funny? Are you mourning? I see, you're still dreaming of Zubeida. Are you buying a watch? Has she got a job or something? "L'll be late for the office "Make sure the baby has its bottle" Stop it When you're married, why would she need a watch? - Don't mention her to the others - Why not? They'd think it's wrong - Try to understand - What do you mean? Love marriages aren't part of our culture People think girls like Zubeida are bad. They don't respect them You should want people to respect you Do you understand? 'Those who give to the poor... "...receive guidance... "...from their Lord "And they shall prosper..." His head hit a branch Thank God the bus was going slowly Or he would have been killed - Those who spread evil go to hell - Do non-believers go to heaven? No, only Muslims go to heaven No, anyone who's good goes to heaven Allah is very generous He knows people's intentions and forgives whom He wants Shall I continue? No, it's my turn You're back?

Something for the country For the country? You've been listening to those city boys, right? They're conning you. They won't make you a leader Big words and no results Be sensible.

I wait for you playing the flute I'm your slave I didn't say that Then what? Tell me. What are you saying? What's come over you? Time for prayers. Close your shops Come to the mosque. Close up It's time for business That's the rule The rule? Whose rule? Sir, Allah has decreed Do I need an upstart like you to tell me what Allah has or hasn't decreed? No one tells me where to pray 30"'!

But this involves others too If someone suspects you tomorrow, how can we defend you? We need some proof But what? What proof can I give? You got it wrong What Rasheed means is we need a firm commitment Only then can we defend you and your mother Are you OK? I'm OK What's up? Have you no shame?

She'll go home tomorrow These pilgrims come and go, but no one has seen my Mina Do you think your Mina is still a Muslim and praying somewhere? Waiting for her father to collect her? She's waited enough. She'll never come back No, she's not like you Well done, Brother Amin. Now go away Where's Saleem? I'll have to do all the work for my daughter's wedding He's no good when he's like this If he gets any worse, there'll be trouble I'll keep an eye on him during the wedding Ayesha, you're like a sister to me I feel ashamed. I don't know how to tell you You don't want me to attend the wedding It's too dangerous Keep this It's for you So this is how Veero left and Ayesha stayed behind Do we know who left... ...and who stayed? We didn't want her to leave Rawalpindi, 2002 "Pakistan will not be a haven for Islamic extremists "That is what the President said while addressing a delegation..." I remember Ayesha very clearly But what's the point of remembering her? Does it change the price of onions? Sometimes I dream of her I preserve each and every dream so they never leave me Mr Saleem, is there a conflict between democracy and Islam? - What do you think? - Look... How can enforcing Islamic law... ...endanger democracy in Pakistan? We're a Muslim nation. The ways of Islam are part of our culture We've followed the ways of Islam for centuries Now legalizing Islamic customs is simply a formality After all, why did we create Pakistan? Pakistan was made for Islam
