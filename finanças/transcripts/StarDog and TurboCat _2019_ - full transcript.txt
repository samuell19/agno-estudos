T-minus 10 minutes and counting. Buddy, how'd you like your new spacesuit! David, David, David, look it's got a radio and it's blue and I love it! I don't speak dog, but I think that's a yes! I packed your lunch specially, and I got the space capsule all ready for you! Huh? Attention all personnel. Standby to evacuate the launch pad. Buddy, I know you're scared. You're thinking how can a little doggy ride a great big rocket like that? But I know you can do it Buddy, you're gonna be a hero! and just as soon as the capsule lands I'm gonna to come find it and give you this back. I promise. That's it! You're gonna be a stardog! Now come here. It's a little bumpy! All systems are go. You're doing fine, hang in there Buddy. Whoa, David! I can see the stars. I'm in spa... David, what's happening?? Buddy? Buddy, come in! Can you hear me, David? David, David! Ew, ew! David? Where am I? What happened? Oh look, a human! They'll help! Er, excuse me, sir! Ahh, a dog, help! Oh my gosh, a dog! Don't panic! I'm dialing 911! Stay away from my baby! Darned kids! Oh jeepers! How did I get here? Why is everyone so mean? David, David! Please come in David! I don't know what that is in dog years but it's a lot! Oh boy,! The hatch! The space capsule's hatch! It must have broken off in the re-entry. I fell out and so where's the rest of the capsule gone? Where is David? And how'd this get here?? Of course! A friendly neighborhood police officer will help me! Oh, but he's gonna get away unless I chase the car Chase the car! Help, help, somebody! Hey pal, you gotta help me! Please, I can't breathe in here! Open it, open it, quick, please! It doesn't open! Maybe we could ask the police officer for help? Are you nuts? Here, let me try. No, no, please, no, no not in there. Ow no, no, please look, look, can we, I can't do, I choke, I, I can't breathe, no, it's just no, no, no, no, no, not there! Help! Oh jeepers, oh jeepers, what kind of horrible place is, hold on. What the? Teach you to mess with my masterpiece. W- hat did you just, who are you? Some call me the Dark Feline, others, the Un-Collared crusader! But all tremble before the hero Glenfield deserves. Turbocat! A cat? I should have known. Bark, bark blah blah blah. Ha, it's my nap time. Turbocat is out of here. Smokescreen. You danged kids! Too easy! Activate autopilot. Update status. Turbocat sticks it to the humans again. Hashtag: Stupid mutts! Hashtag: Awesome! Welcome home sir, and might I say you were especially heroic tonight. Shame some dumb mutt tried to abuse my artwork. We should celebrate sir, but I'm terribly sorry, we're fresh out of milk. Nah, later, Sinclair. I'm too worn out being awesome to drink now anyway. Ahhhhh, nap time. Hey, let me out! Hey, will you can it! If my nap time gets ruined by some stupid stray dog! I'm not a stray! I was fired into space in 1969! Yeah, right! And I walked on the moon in my pajamas last weekend. Of course you're a stray. Connect to the CCTV network. Isolate the dog's barking and scan backwards. See? You're a dirty old stray. But since you're clearly new round here I'll give you the 101. You're in Glenfield, where humans hate animals. And when Officer Peck finds a dangerous unhygienic stray animal he locks them up in the pound and they're never seen again. Close the door on your way out. Yeah, well, I hope you get sent to the pound! I'm not gonna though. - Know why? - Uh... Because I've got one of these. Oh! And that. This, that, that, this, two of those and this. Triple ply carbon fiber. Hand stitched. As worn by Glenfield's uncatchable and incredibly handsome super cat, sticking it to the humans 24/7. Ah, ah! Don't touch the cape. Um, there does appear to be a little UHT remaining, Master Felix Sir. Ugh, how many times it's a secret identity. You met Sinclair already. 80's technology but I fixed him up to be my loyal companion and open cans of cat food. Oh geez, I'm lost 50 years in the future in a town where everyone hates animals, and the only other pet is some kind of crazy-super-cat-thingy. I hope David comes to find me real quick! What? Don't tell me you're drooling over a human Careful, cat. David loved me so much he fired me off in an experimental space capsule! Oh, he sounds great. I mean, maybe if you can find this so-called space capsule this so-called animal lover will come and find his so-called moron dog! That's it! David said he'd come and find the capsule. He can't find me if I'm not with it! But how's a little doggie like me gonna find a space capsule? - OK, maybe I wasn't clear before: you're a butt sniffing, drool dispensing doofus and I'm not gonna help you find a space whatnot or a nasty human. OK, you leave me no choice. What are you doing? Trying to show you that I'm nice? This usually works on humans. I'm sick of hearing about humans. Sinclair! Wait, wait! Maybe if you had some milk I'd have listened to you. Laters. Ugh! Oh boy, I hope spacesuits aren't dry-clean only. Ah jeepers, when did humans get so mean to animals? David wasn't like that. He loved animals. Now all I've got to remember him by is this packed lunch he left me. Yeah, thing is, I only drink full fat. Oh gee whiz mister Felix Turbocat sir, you got to help me find the space capsule, please. I found the hatch already, this was there. Sinclair, fetch a camera so I can film myself kicking his butt this time. You're my only hope to find David, please. Ugh, you're still chasing after that dumb human, huh? David might be a human but I believe, deep in my heart, that humans are good, and that David's out there looking for me right now. Please, will you use your powers to help me so I can be reunited with my owner as their loyal, loving pet. Huh? Sorry, can you summarize that? Er, woof? Awww, the little doggy hasn't realized. This David isn't coming to find you because humans hate animals. Oh geez, I'm I'm sorry I wasted your time. Sir, the bite marks on this carrot are highly familiar. Huh, hit up the CCTV again. That one, full screen. Top left. Zoom in. Closer, stop! Enhance. Cassidy. You're right sir! Perhaps Ms. Cassidy knows the whereabouts of this alleged space capsule? Rabbit has my space capsule? I love chasing rabbits! So do I, so do I. Yeah, well, er, since I've got nothing planned I reckon I'll take a look around, see if I can work out where she's hiding. Sinclair, get the car. Shall I pack some lettuce for Ms. Cassidy, sir? Yeah, let's make it cozy in there. Does this mean I can come with you? Turbocat works alone, dog breath! Confirm stray animals in the park. Sinclair, the car? What do we do now, Felix? Felix? Felix! Hey, wait for me! Hey, don't run with me you idiot! Run the other way! But if I run another way he won't be able to chase both of us! Ugh, stupid dog! Here, fetch! You dropped this! It's really fun to catch it though. Do you want to drop it again? Unbelievable. Help me David! What the? What did you just? Do it again! How are you doing that? I don't know, I don't know! Well keep doing it! Don't stop! I'm coming David! I'm coming! You need to work on stopping. Sorry Felix, I'm just excited I'm on the trail of David. I told you it's Turbocat, oh, forget it. Ugh, I can't believe I'm gonna have to find Cassidy without my cape. Look, I don't know how you did that running thing, like you've had too much marrowbone jelly or something but I guess it could come in useful. How do I know I can trust you? You shot me already! Plus cats do that licking thing, yuck. One word: hy-giene. My name's Buddy, not Gene! And I still don't know if I can trust you! Who is this Cassidy? Where are we anyway? That carrot you found came from this store, so it's odds-on this is she's hiding. They don't open for an hour, but we need to be careful. Come on. Every time! Coast is clear, eugh! I think you got some drool on me. Eugh the smell, it'll never come off. Jeepers, I've never seen a store this big before. Ooh look, a ball! OK it's a really bouncy ball but I nearly got it and there some others too that I saw but I didn't chase. - What? - Nothing. There is absolutely nothing idiotic about this behavior. Oh, okay, good, because for a, bubbles! I think I got all of them but if you see any more let me know, OK? It is at the top of my to do list. Great, I'll look out for, car! It's a lot smaller than I thought! Tastes funny too. OK, I can deal with the drooling and I'm prepared to look away if you want to sniff another dog's butt, but there are limits! So you want one too, Felix? Felix? Felix? I'm napping. But we're in a hurry. Sorry. Napping. Sunbeam. Hey, wake up. I need you to help me find my capsule and David. Remember? And I'm napping, and don't give two hoots about your dumb human, remember? Er, I had actually forgotten that, but geez, I heard cats were lazy, I didn't realize they were this selfish too. OK, that's it. I'm out of here. I can find Cassidy myself without this hassle and without getting dog hair on everything. Huh? No, come back! Oh, you criminal genius. It's locked. We'll have to go outside and come all the way back in again. Like I don't have better things to... Dang it, a human! And we're trapped in here. Brilliant. Her bike's jamming the door! She just needs to get on it and ride off for crying out loud. Hey, kid! Go home, scram! Yeah, I'm way bigger than I look! My hissing signals immanent violence! Dang it, this normally works! Ah Felix, I think she's afraid of us. We've got to show her she we're good. Like this! Haven't you learned, that doesn't work! Well it's the only thing we've got! Give it a chance, please Felix! Come on, come on! Glenfield police, officer Peck speaking. Hello? Hello? I just realized I haven't eaten for 50 years! Now I understand why dogs get tied up outside. You could be more discerning. What is that incredible smell? Agh, don't get DROOL on it! Here. Purple packaging. Anything in purple is high class. Wowzers! It never seems to matter what flavor the can says, pet food always tastes the same. Ha ha, ain't that the truth. So, that was a neat trick you pulled on the human. Oh it wasn't a trick. I knew humans still loved animals! Yeah, my experience of humans is clearly radically different from yours. When Peck came to town he told all the other humans that animals were mean and dangerous and then locked up all the strays. And is that when you started dressing up as TurboCat? Hey, hey, it's not dressing up! And what's with that get-up? You don't actually expect me to believe you went into space? Sure I did! They trained a whole load of animals, rabbits, dogs, mice, even a cat. But David picked me. He said his own pet was the one he trusted most of all. What, and you just believed him? Of course! I told you, I believe deep down humans are good. Freeze! You want to test that hypothesis? Uh, maybe later! We have you surrounded! Don't try to run! Climb! Freeze! Lower your paws and step away from the glass! Hey, what do you? You! The so-called Turbocat! What is your mission? Are you searching for supplies of catnip again? Catnip... Cease and desist! How did you locate the secret headquarters of G.U.A.R.D.? Er, say what now? G.U.A.R.D. Glenfield Underground Animal Rights Division. I'm head of Tactical Operations, and this is our public relations specialist: Tinker. Er, Bullion, if these neutrino readings are accura... Not now, Tinker! Hey, now I've just about had... Silence! Remain in your present positions or you will be neutralized. At ease Bullion! I'll tell you if I need anyone neutralizing. Ma'am yes ma'am. Commencing perimeter patrol! Cassidy! F-fancy running into you! Confirm stray animals located at Mega Store. - Proceeding to investigate. - 10-4. Congratulations Felix, you've led Peck RIGHT to our secret hideout. Now we need a new place to hide. I thought you'd never ask. It's lovely to see you again Ms. Cassidy. Can I offer you some spring water? You always did serve the best, Sinc'. Yeah, I upgraded him since last time. Two terabytes storage and he does sparkling and still. Ms. Cassidy, Felix told me that you could help me find my space capsule. Actually, we hoped you could help us find it. Sinclair, if you would. 8K high definition video streaming in realtime. Pretty awesome, huh? Thank you Felix. As you know Buddy, in 1969 you were selected from a group of highly trained animals to fly in an experimental rocket. David! But what you don't know is that the space capsule was secretly powered by a crystalline substance called hyperlithium. There was a crystal in the space capsule? But I just thought it was a rocket! Double rocket powered, and with titanium chassis, ejection seats and check this out. Quiet please Felix. Buddy, G.U.A.R.D.'s mission is to find the space capsule and use the Hyperlithium to protect the animals of Glenfield. But how can a crystal help? Erm, the Hyperlithium emits energy waves that can... That's a good question! Buddy, our chief scientist, Todd. It's an honor! And to answer your question this little invention of mine is powered by only a tiny crystal. Once we've found the space capsule, we'll harness the Hyperlithium to power a much larger machine, GUARDIAN! Oh golly! With GUARDIAN, the animals of Glenfield will finally be able to stand up to Peck. We have to find the space capsule! It's our only hope. As you can see we're having some teething troubles. Buddy, will you join G.U.A.R.D. and help us? He's gonna fit right in with the rest of those losers! Felix, remind me how TurboCat pays for all the gadgets and capes and so on? 160 million views. The advertising royalties must be super. Hey, that one's not funny! No one can resist the spot of light, OK? Buddy, Felix wants me to come live in his secret base and play with all his super-gadgets but I believe we can free Glenfield's animals from Peck's tyranny if we all work together. Er, I'm just a dog. You're an animal hero, Buddy. And we need heroes. It worked! I've got a vector on the Hyperlithium! Er, connecting to the CCTV network now! We're too late. Peck has found the capsule and taken it back to the pound! No pet has ever gone in and come out again! Ahem. This sounds like a job for Turbocat! Hey Cassidy, mission, Turbocat-gets-capsule, phase one completed! Felix you idiot! You're gonna get us all caught! Get back here this minute... Yeah, I thought so too. Proceeding to phase two, huh? It's almost too easy. The space capsule is right behind this door. You're not a space capsule! Hey, hey, are you here to get me out! Please, help, come on! I must have taken a wrong turn. Hey, get me outta here! I can't breathe in this place, please! Hey be quie, Peck is right down the... Arrggh! What the? Get it off, get it off! - Sorry! - Dang it! Shut up! Will you cut it out with that? Danged thing won't... Because I can hear it barking right down the hall, that's why, it's dangerous! And disgusting. Hold on, I've got another call. Hello? Hello? James, it's your father here. Ah, Dad, I'm at work. I can't find my danged radio. Well where did you have it last? Well I was in the bathroom and I thought I put it there. Yeah, yeah, yeah, okay, I get the picture. I tell you that darn thing is like 50 years old. We can let this guy out later, come on! Hold on, this thing's still on the blink. How'd that happen? Follow me! Wait up! So, er, did Cassidy send you? She said something about a massive jerk who deserves to have his hind kicked for eternity, and there were some other words too but I didn't understand. Ah. But we've got to get the capsule, now more than ever! This way! There it is! Hold up! Slow down! Whoa! What the what? Do you have any idea what they're gonna do to us? Take us somewhere nice where there's plenty of food and sunbeams? No, someplace where I won't be able to breathe at all! Geez Felix. How was I to know your high-tech multi-function cat blaster was so sensitive? I'm sorry. Ah, it's not your fault. It's the sort of mistake anyone could make. I just really needed to see David again. He's always been there for me, ever since I was a puppy. Well, ever since I was a kitten I've been a stray, out on the street, alone. I never had anyone who looked out for me like that. Thanks for trying to rescue me. It was pretty heroic. So is this a normal day at work, Dad? No, I only go to headquarters once a month. And on a normal day childcare doesn't cancel at the last minute. What is that thing, Dad? Dangerous, you leave that to me. And are the animals really dangerous too, Dad? The strays? They're filthy, they could have diseases, and Alex, you know you can't ever trust an animal. Yeah, but... But nothing, Alex! I just think they're no good for our town. Heads-up. Cassidy! Whoa, rescue mission!? Just like old times, eh Felix? You go storming in all by yourself and leave me to clean up after you. Wow, pretty amazing. I knew you had some secret moves with that thing, abracadabra Don't say that again. If Todd's aligned the explosives correctly we should be out of here in three, two, one... The kid! She must still be inside! Buddy, Buddy come back! Whoa Buddy, we have to get out of here. But the kid's still in there. Okay, okay, you're heaviest. Hey, I hadn't eaten for 50 years! So stay here while I go up front. It's moving Just a few seconds more! It's too heavy! Come on Buddy! You've been into space for crying out loud! You can do this! What? What? Oh! Whoops! Incredible footage coming from highway 17 outside Glenfield with what appears to be a dog holding a pick-up truck in the air. That the dog hasn't been identified yet. Lifting the vehicle... Truly an incredible dog. Over now Sandra in downtown... Now the whole world has seen the capsule on TV, David will come find me any time now! Shows a cat, pulling a child out of the truck completely unharmed. Congratulations sir, there's one human child who might not follow her father's profession. Shall we celebrate with single cream or double? That's much better. Always happy to help a fellow animal, Victor. Welcome to G.U.A.R.D. Uh, everyone? No, no, no, not this way! Why didn't you leave them on the road? Ma'am, if the humans enter the perimeter I request permission to use lasers set to disintegrate! Er, hey there. Hey, cut it out with the wagging! I'm sorry but I can't help it! It just has a mind of its own! Well watch what you're doing, it nearly had my eye out! I could have been... Hey there you two. What is happening? Oh, I've heard of this! Cats do it before they cough up a hairball. That's coughing, you idiot. Nice kitty. Don't. Alex! Oh my gosh, are you OK? I'm fine, Dad. And so are the animals. Animals? Did they get loose? Did they hurt you? Where are they? They... They escaped. Must have run off. I'm fine though, they didn't hurt me or anything. Oh, oh thank heavens. Sorry Alex, after what happened to you when you were little I'm just so... Maybe I should go get checked out in the hospital. I can't nap watching you do that. Oh, sorry Felix, I'm waiting for David. Well, you're freaking me out. Are you sure he's coming? He fired you into space for crying out loud. What do you mean? Silence on deck! We are working with hazardous materials here! The Hyperlithium! The effect it's had on Buddy is incredible. Probably phase-aligned neutrinos interacting with his DNA... What's wrong, Todd? Oh... The Hyperlithium is emitting a strange kind of radiation. It has the power to interact with animal DNA, destabilizing it, changing it. We must be careful. Peck knew it was dangerous. What was he planning to do with it? You don't think the humans plan to use the Hyperlithium against us? Heaven knows what humans would do if they had this kind of power. How long before Guardian is ready? Well I still need to connect the rocket boosters and get the guidance online. I'm going as fast as I can. But maybe Peck's just worried about his family. He doesn't really mean to... I had an owner once too, Buddy. I thought he cared for me, loved me even. But he rejected me, cast me aside, forced me to become a stray, living on the street, hiding in the garbage. He's right, Peck locked me in the pound! I couldn't move, I couldn't breathe. I ain't never going back. The humans could do anything to us, like David did to you. Hey, David is my friend! He's good! OK OK, now calm down everyone. Ma'am, permission to use nuclear force? Can you please all be quiet?! I am trying to nap. Master Buddy sir, perhaps you need to take a short stroll? Mr. David might already be in the neighborhood. Of course! David might be out there looking for me! Master Felix, perhaps some warm milk might help you nap. Why are you always running around after that jerk, Sinc'? Apologies Ms. Cassidy, my 1980's programming is somewhat obsolete. In fact, I believe that was why I was discarded and thrown onto the garbage heap. Until Master Felix rescued and repaired me, of course. It really was rather super, Ms. Cassidy. We have to learn more about the Hyperlithium. Agreed. Peck's still in the hospital. I'll go and get the rest of the equipment. I'll be back before dark. Er, excuse me? I'm sorry, I thought Sinclair told you. To study the Hyperlithium we thought it was best if I slept over. Uh... That's OK isn't it? Er yeah, it's er, yes, that's fine. I mean yeah, totally, fine. Yes, that's, that's fine. OK, good. I'm sorry, about earlier. In the truck I mean. It's just, I spent years in the magic show, hiding inside a hat before I escaped. I learned the hard way there's no such thing as magic. Your whole superhero thing, it's like you thought wearing a cape would magically solve everything. I'm sorry, I guess I was trying to... Impress me? I just thought if I had all the gadgets and the mask then everyone would think I was cool and no one would realize how much the whole humans thing got to me. But now, what you did, and Buddy, maybe Peck won't catch us after all. Maybe we're actually going to win. Maybe magic is real after all. I'll get the gear. You guard the capsule, okay? Guard the capsule. Guard the capsule... Aw jeepers, I thought David would be here by now. He said he'd come and find the... Space capsule. Space capsule! The capsule, the truck! It's getting away! What? But the capsule's right... It must be Peck! He's got out the hospital, he's found where the space capsule is somehow. But how? Cassidy! He must have caught her and she's led him back! Which way did he take her? This way! Get in! Hey, no drooling! I just had this cleaned. Where did the truck go? Can I open a window? Uh, useless. Autopilot: locate the truck. Ah, what's that flashing? Activating smoke screen. You idiot! Engage autopilot! It's headed for the interstate. Autopilot: turn onto route seven. Searching for a restaurant with that name locally... What? No, route seven! Searching for a carwash with that name locally. Let me do it! Stop doing that! Put it back! The other one! The other other one! - The truck! - My capsule! Cassidy! Okay, we can stop them with this. Aim for the fender. Not the capsule, get the truck! Here, let me do that. Stop! We have to get the capsule! What? No way, we're closing in. Hey, get off, you moron. Without the capsule I'll never see David again! Cassidy's heading to the pound unless I... Do you have any idea how expensive spare parts are for one of these? There, look! Huh? But I don't understand. It was a decoy! Peck just wanted us to chase it! But why? To get us away from... What were you two doing? Cassidy! I thought Peck had caught you. What? I can look after myself, Felix. Where's Todd? He didn't get out in time. Victor too. Why the heck weren't you... Was there a sunbeam, Felix? You were napping? You kept me awake with all that guarding. Next thing I know you're chasing the stupid capsule and... And you two fell right into Peck's trap. While you're off playing at superheroes, he's won. He's got Victor, and Todd and the Hyperlithium. It's over. Negative ma'am, we move in a pincer formation, surround the building and neutralize the humans with minimal collateral damage to G.U.A.R.D. Bullion, G.U.A.R.D. is a joke! You're about as much use in tactical operations as a fish! Our PR mouse never says anything. Uh... And our scientist is headed to the pound because none of you clowns can actually work together! Peck's gonna catch us, and we can't just wave a magic wand to stop him. We've got to get that capsule back! Keep quiet. And try not to chase anything. Oh I won't. Can you try not to nap? Oh, so it's my fault! None of this would have happened if you hadn't gone chasing after the first thing you see! Jumping jeepers, you were napping when you should have been guarding the capsule! There was a sunbeam! Peck! He better not be playing with my stuff. You're still worried about all your gadgets? I'm never gonna find David without the capsule. You're so selfish. Well at least I'm not still running around after a human who blasted me out of his life 50 years ago! David didn't blast me, he said he'd... Typical. A dog and a cat fighting each other. We threw the rest of your toys out but I like this one. Almost as handy as this. Hey, leave that alone, it's mine! No, it's mine. Todd? So where's Peck? What are you doing here? What am I doing? What were you doing back in 1969, pushing aside the world's greatest feline scientist so you could blast off into space in my place? After I escaped, I swiftly learned Hyperlithium has different effects on different animals. The effects on dogs we've already seen but on cats the effect was merely to prolong my life while I waited, waited 50 years for the rest of it to fall back to earth. I could barely wait any longer to get rid of you two jokers so I could complete my plan in privacy. So wait that was Victor driving Peck's truck? You two set us up! Then where the heck is Peck? By the look of things he's out of hospital and going to check out what's happening at the old museum right about now. Hey, what's going on in here? What the, animals? But you said Peck was gonna use the Hyperlithium to do bad stuff to us! Oh I'm sure he would if I don't stop him. Humans, pah! They just want to lock us up! Well, now we're in charge, Peck! Heel boy, heel before Todd! It seems I was right about Hyperlithium's effects on humans. Now, once this Hyperlithium bomb is fully charged it'll detonate and then all the humans in town will become servants to their rightful masters. Todd, you won't get away with this. Oh, do I have to spell out the irony? You've been beaten by a dog and a cat who can actually work together. - What the? - Get this off of me! Sinclair? This way Master Felix, Master Buddy. We don't have much time. Get them, get them! Sinclair! Sinclair? I'm terribly sorry sir, it seems I won't be able to serve any con-con-con... Sinclair It's been a privilege being your c-c-companion. No 80's throwback robot is going to stand in our way. David will stop you! Oh really? David? Well let me tell you, David invented the Hyperlithium! He was a scientist! He knew it was dangerous, that's why he sent a dumb animal to fly it instead of a human. No! You think you were being some sort of hero? David used you, Buddy! He didn't love you and he's never coming back! No, no, no, no, no, no! David was my friend! Okay, when I get there I'm going to call you and... Whoa. Gather 'round, people, gather round. Okay, so we attack with lasers. And fire piranhas into their eyeballs. Codename: operation Hopeless Cause. Daddy? Daddy, what have the animals done to you? Oh Daddy, you were right. I already have a sticker. Heh, yeah, I got you pretty good. I need your help, Buddy. There's a kid out there who thinks animals are mean and nasty. I need to show her we can be more than that. Humans are the mean ones. That's what you said. Maybe. You used to believe people were good. And I believe in you. I'm just a dog. And I'm just a cat with a silly mask who wanted everyone to think he was cool. You're the real hero, Buddy! You've been into space. You can run faster than, well, you know. And you're strong. You're the strongest person I know. And that's why I got you this. Triple ply carbon fiber. You're not just a dog, Buddy. You are Stardog! - What the? - What? How's that happened? Hey, what's that sound? What the what? Whoa! Thank you, thank you. Stand back, Superpets coming though. Give it up Todd. Leave the humans alone. Yeah, let's show them how great pets can be, how they can trust us and we can show them how to be better people. That was long-winded, Buddy can you summarize? Woof! Couldn't have said it better myself. Now let me just get one thing clear. Did you two really think that I would work on this for 50 years and not have some backup plan in case a couple of Superpets turned up to rain on my parade? It does sound kind of sensible. You stole my thunder once before Buddy, you won't stop me this time. And you, Felix, everyone thinks you're a bit of jerk! Did you know about this? My control of Hyperlithium's power is far greater than yours. As you shall now observe. Huh? Darn kid! OK Super-Victor's a problem, sure, but even if we beat him the real problem is Todd and the Hyperlithium Bomb. We need a way to neutralize him. Affirmative, he's a cat! What's his weakness? Catnip. Of course! We can get some in the Mega Store. Come on Felix. Catnip. Er, I think it might be best if I go alone. I'll be back soon as I can. OK, now all we need to do is get the dog under control. But how. Ah, well we've got all these... There must be a way to get him rounded up, think! Suggest we use maximum prejudice. I said, we've got all the... Quiet, I'm trying to think! Ugh! Will you all just shut up and listen to me! I said we've still got all the broken gadgets and robot parts they threw out of the museum. Plus, we've got access to a tactical operations goldfish. Oh yeah! The park is closed. I'm sorry, were you talking to me? Or, or to him? Commence operation Fish Tank! Fish tank? Is that a joke? Negative. I'm a tactical operations goldfish! I am not going back inside there. It's time for humans to get locked up. They might be human, but I believe deep in my heart that humans are good and we should be looking out for them right now! Please, will you use your powers to help me so I can be united with an owner as their loyal, loving pet. That is the lamest thing I have ever heard. Really? How about if I do this? Cut that out. Let's play catch! Now what was that about playing catch? Oh, someone wants to play catch? Not again! I can't breathe in here! I can't believe that worked! It only works on some stupid dog, is what it does! Yeah, well that's what happens when animals work together! Well, I won't make the same mistake twice. Hey, I thought Guardian was supposed to protect animals? Hah! It's been hard being a stray for 50 years. Now, with this Hyperlithium Powered machine I'll finally be able to treat humans like they treated me! Er, what do we do now Felix? Huh? Now would be a good time to show Todd your shopping. Whoa, whoa, whoa, slow down. When you get that out I can't be held accountable for my actions. What are you two doing down there? OK, ready? Cat nip! Er, come and get it. Give it to me! Give it to me now! Sorry, what was that? I can't hear you over the faint hum of my micro filtered air conditioning. What happened? Did we win already? Is it nap time? Uh, something about air conditioning? Oh, right. Where was I? Oh yes, how hard it is being a stray for 50 years. Well how about I show you what that was like, huh? How do you like that Hyperlithium power, huh? You disgusting creatures! O, where are they? I sure hope I don't step on them by accident! Come back! I'm not finished with you yet! Ugh, they're horrible stinky strays! Clean them up! Let's put these dirty strays out with the rest of the trash! Hey, Todd Abracadabra. No, sunbeam! So sleepy. Way to go Cassidy! Felix, she made a... He always was a sucker for that. So sleepy. I was headed out of town when I saw you on TV. All the theatrics with the crowd and the capes, it was almost... Magical? No, it was the stupidest thing I've ever seen in my life. But you're working together, it's impressive. Oh, will you shut up? Tinted glass, pretty neat, huh? Oh, right. Cassidy. You know I'm actually glad you're here so I can tell you how pointless and nauseating G.U.A.R.D. was and how much fun I had hiding how your Guardian was secretly being fully weaponized. Todd, you don't have to do this. Yes I do, I want you dead. Now, how do I aim this thing? There we go! Now I just line up the target with the little dot of light... It's alright, it's gone now. I'm gonna get that spot of light one day. Hey, is that? Grandpa, Grandpa! Where are you? I'm coming! I thought Victor scared all the humans away! And my Hyperlithium Bomb is still ticking down to detonation. When it goes off her and her stupid grandpa will become my slaves. Felix, we've got to do something... Felix! Sorry kids. It's the only way to stop the bomb enslaving Alex. But when the bomb goes off it'll destroy the robot and... Yeah, looks like it's my turn to take a one way trip to space now, huh? But it's the only way I can prove to Alex that pets are good. Felix, you don't have to do this to impress me, ugh! Um, Felix? Hey Buddy. We made a pretty good team, huh? Shame I never got to meet David. Ah, Felix... No, listen Buddy, I've been thinking. David sent you into space because he knew the Hyperlithium was dangerous and he trusted you more than anyone else to protect it. David trusted me? David knew you were a hero, Buddy, and you've GOT to believe he's still out there looking for you. Do you hear me Buddy? You've got to believe, David loves you. Yes, he's a good person and he loves me! Er, Buddy? Oh wow, I can fly. Oh wow, I can fly! StarDog, fetch! Don't suppose you've got any more of that catnip? Don't you ever do that again. What's happening?? - Daddy! - Alex! Daddy, did you see that? The cat blasted into the sky in a rocket and then the dog here flew up and he saved him! It was amazing! You're right, oh my gosh you're right! They're not mean, or nasty or dangerous, they saved all of us! These animals are heroes! Daddy, can we keep them? You bet honey, Grandpa will love it. Where is Grandpa? Grandpa! You darned kids! Never listened to a word I said! I told you I was waiting, waiting for the day I hear a dog can fly and I know that my Buddy has come back. Buddy? Buddy, is that you? Yeah, told you he had to believe, didn't I? Another awesome prediction from er, anyway. A month later and things have settled down a bit. After he found Todd and Victor suitable new homes, Peck quit the force to spend more time with Alex and they decided to re-open the old museum, with a new star exhibit. Alex helps her Dad out in the cafe, with a little help. Coming right up. Yeah, Tinker fixed Sinclair and programmed him to make lattes. Buddy works here too as guard dog, when he's not taking David for a walk. And me, well I do spend a considerable amount of time napping but when I'm not doing that I'm watching the screens. No, not that! That. Cassidy magically reformed G.U.A.R.D. with Tinker as Chief Scientist and Bullion as tactical operations goldfish. Anyone who's mean to animals, or picks on someone smaller than them, or has crazy plans to make a robot hamster into president and take over the w... Sorry, this is really long-winded, Buddy can you summarize? Woof. Translation: bad people better watch out for StarDog and TurboCat!
