I just want to know if you accept my proposal. The only thing I want to know is when and hurjag can hit you on the mouth. Laughing Why did you throw away one million? I offer one million for the drawings. -Only you tips on where they are. -Now try to understand this. The drawings belong to the Swedish state. I will never tell where they are. Nobody needs to know that there is your invention that leaves the country. -I will have drawings! -''Do ask to'', said Monday. Quiet, Rasmus. Fine little boy you have. It must be nice to have such a lovely little boy. You dare! I just want to make clear attjag is serious. Give me detjag want, so you get one million.

Eva-Lotta! -Come on. We need to find the cave. -I want to my dad. Rasmus, we can not go to your dad now. If you wish to become a White Rose, you must be brave. -Let 's do something fun. -What? We will crawl under a spruce and sleep there at night. I do not want to be in the woods after dark. But in our cave, you may well be? Kalle! What good that you came. We thought that we would have to sleep in the woods. "We have escaped all day! -For attjag to become a White Rose. The boxes -Eat only! Kim's dad offers. -Does he? Yes, although he does not know about it. -Know the where we are? -No, we dare not interfere in anybody. But we wrote a note that they would not be worried. Tomorrow we will paddle to the mainland.

It will go badly for you all. Up with them now! Reply before I turn back from you! Anders does not know where they are. It knows only Kalle. I guess it is you who are called. Look carefully at, dear little Kim. You get an hour of reflection, then happens something very unpleasant. Do not scare me. I agree with something very illegal. If I stay in Sweden, riskerarjag life sentence. When I leave here should I have the drawings with me. I will do anything to find out where you hid them. Understand you? Use your common sense, if you have something. One hour! Tell me where they are, so we may end in this, for Rasmus sake. -Rasmus, you should get a new barkb?t. -I will not. You are not nice. -They come in an hour. What do we do? -They will kill you. And us. -If I could just run away ... -Smart idea, Kalle. I trorjag know! What are you doing? Come on! Well, stop it!
