Yeah, not bad. Not bad! I can't imagine how many chicks you brought here. Just a few Yeah. You don't waste your time. But you did not want to come. No, I prefer hotels. - Good for you. - Hmm. Well, but I do like you. You are one of my best clients. Come on, let's go. I don't want to do this the rest of my life, but I don't know, for now is okay.
