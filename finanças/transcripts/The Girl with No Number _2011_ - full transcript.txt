Open it. It's the latest model. I have the same one. We are a couple, so we should have things in pairs. Why is she in a cage? Because she was causing trouble. Please release her. You always put her in a cage. No need, no need. If you have a problem with that, I'll put you in the cage with her. Why do you keep complaining? You've complained many times. Please release her. She did nothing. No need, no need. Hollywood, Florida I got a coupon. Sorry, this isn't from our store. That's for the water. Yeah, but this is for the Westside Market, this is * West Market. You don't Honor competitor's coupons? Not at this store, it's store policy. Screw it! That's not what I said. I don’t care if they’ve got commercial property. Everybody knows the rates are gonna reset, that’s the deal. Told the commercial market’s in the tank right now. Yeah, I told them that! What do they think, they’re gonna pay 900 a month forever? Anna, are you hungry? What do you think, pizza? What about some nuggets? You like chicken nuggets today? You’re early. You got my check? Hey Anna! God damn it! Yeah. I know he wrote one I just... don't know where I put it. You know what? I quit. You'll be hearing from ny husband. Eat crap, Marta! What is it? What is that? Spit it out! Spit it out! That witch! Bring this over here. I don't have all day. Come on, come on! Alright, alright! Come on, come on. That's it. You can offer 350. He'll counter back at 380, but he’ll take 355, if you change your mind, you got two weeks to cancel. You can’t go soft on a deal like this. Commercial market’s still got a lot of muscle and hustle. Okay. Offer him 340. Your kidding? I’ll get it done-up fast and cheap. Sneak one of my crews in here? Work their butts off, and they don’t need a lot of pay. Mexicans? Hell, no! Vietnamese. Kick-ass. Very reliable. Anna! You said last week you'll have the money today. We have nothing left! Please be reasonable... What can I do? Stop it! Stop it! Stop it! Mother, are you alright? What's wrong? You owe him money? I don't want to bother you with this. Mr. Chin I don't think the baseball bat is required. You agree? Thank you. Tran Hieu, but it's our problem. Not yours. Ly, it's my duty to watch over you. After all, we'll be married soon. I'll arrange a dinner for our two families. Some time in the next week or so. Will that be alright? You're so lucky! I hate you! He’s awfully good-looking. I am lucky. Sometimes I cannot believe it. I want a phone like this! Ask him to get me one! I can’t do that. Why not?! Can he buy us a car?! Can he buy us a boat!? How about a big house in the city? But he’s filthy rich! His whole family is rich! That’s not why I love him. And it’s not why I’m marrying him. But he’s not poor. I have good news. Last summer I met someone. I've been seeing her a lot. Is that why you were late yesterday? Yeah, he * that guy. His freaking horse piss. And he doesn't care about Anna. But I suppose, you do? You know, he only cares about is this check every month and you were you just playing his little game. You need to wise-up. And do what? Get a divorce? Because that would get really messy. He'd fight me on it, they would take Anna way, and then I could kiss the money forever. How much you getting right now? $4,000 dollars a month and that's just from the trust. I don't know how long that's going to last though if I'm not careful. I got a nasty call last week, they want more proof of where that money is going. That fund is almost up to $2 Million dollars. We go to court, they stick Anna in some retard home, I'm not going to see a dime. You know what this is? Their counter? Their acceptance of 340 on both warehouses. You give me a little tomorrow, I'll get you the third. Sweet. That works for me. Hey it works for me. Father always used to tell you not to worry about things you don’t need to worry about. If he were here, he’d tell you to do exactly what I say. Now you let me take care of this. I have plans for you! I’m not going to marry your choice. I’m going to marry Phuong Ly. You worry too much. The girl quit? Walked out! You lucky son of a witch! It's great timing, and she likes the idea. I’m telling you, our people are hard-working, honest, and they don’t complain. Can we get another glass? Just telling Vu about our problem. He thinks he has a solution. Yeah, I heard about your help. Typical of those people, always complaining and then, they fly the coop. Don’t get me started. Right here. Vietnam? You’re insane! No, I think it's a great idea. We're going to save a crap load of money. Come on. Okay. Legs in. Good. In my heart the fires burning Choose my color by star There's these people always tell me that's a step, a step too far Do you really want to love me? Do you really want to make me cry? Do you really want to hurt me? Do your really want to make me cry? Who’s that? My mother. What’s the matter? Don’t be shy. Who’s this beautiful child? This is the girl I told you about, Phuong Ly. My mother. -I’m sorry for the way we’re-- -You look like drug addicts. It’s my fault. Don’t blame Tran. The driver said you were singing an American song? I’ve been teaching Ly a little English. Maybe with some lessons, she can help with export sales in the office. Why did you come? The Ly brothers are at the factory. They want to cancel the order. Cancel? Why? They say the shipment isn’t up to standard. You better go talk to them. We’ll take Ly home first. No, don’t worry, I’ll see she gets home safely. Go on. I’ll hire us a boat. You should go back. I’ll be fine with your mother. It's going to rain. You might need this. When will I see you? I’ll call you when I can. Phuong Ly! Ly! Hurry! It’s about to rain! Stop right here. Get out. Get out of the boat! The number you have reached is not in service at this time. So, in the end I told him I am a furniture dealer not a shoe salesman. Show them the new equipment we just imported. Please excuse me. Here is the new equipment we bought. What are you doing here? Go away. He doesn’t want to see you. You must know, I’m only doing what he asked me to do. Go now. Go! Go! Don't ever come back! I had a long talk with my mother and now I understand. Our families don't match. Don't try to contact me. Please leave us alone. Goodbye. Thank you for holding Sir. I just confirmed that that's a blackout date as well. Those mileage thing is a joke. I've been a loyal costumer and then one time I want to use my miles it's a bunch of bullcrap. This freaking airlines! This whole mileage thing is a total scam. They make it sound like it’s all free. You know they want $487 in taxes. Here's your passport. This is your visa, and this is your invitation letter just in case they ask. These are for your wife. Show her those photos, she won’t bother you any more. The driver will meet you when you get off the plane. Now listen, this is important. They are going to ask you for proof that you are not married. Don't worry, I got you covered. Had to yank a few teeth to get that one. One more thing. Take some extra cash to give the bride’s family. They like dollars. Sure. Thanks. Ly, aren't you going to eat? Don’t blame yourself. Ma, maybe I can find work in the city. No, I don’t want you leaving. You’re too young. We’ll find a way. Look, this is too late. They want us to ship by June 12. That means we need the material here a week before that. Then you fly there. Please be careful. Otherwise, the edge of the wood will be broken. Got it? I’ll be back as soon as I can. But, I still can’t find my cellphone. Take mine. Excuse me, can I have one more? Look after the store for me. I heard Kim Ngan's son is not going to marry you. Your mother says you’re off to the city. Call my sister, she can help you find work. Really? Who are you looking for? My name is Phuong Ly. Ah, Phuong Ly. You called about the job? Let me get you situated. You can take a shower and get some rest. Be quiet! Come here quickly! Let me tell you, Americans are usually quite big and heavy, but this is normal, and you shouldn’t be concerned. Is this all? You don’t expect free room and meals, do you? Is this what you really want to do? Come with me. Last week I got a letter from one of my girls. She’s married to a doctor in San Francisco, expecting her second child. A lot of girls have gotten rich because of me. They send money home so their families can buy TVs and motorbikes. They build big houses, have babies and send them to good schools. You’re worried about your mother, aren’t you? If you marry rich, these worries will be gone. Thank you for that... Yeah, well I just got to the hotel. Will you calm down? I’ll call you back. Good morning! Nice to see you here. I'm Yên-Khê. My card. I have plenty of girls, all very beautiful. And if you don’t like your first choice, there’s always others. They're waiting for you. Follow me, please. Alright. Be careful with my bags. No, I don’t have his number. You don't have it? I lost my cellphone. I’m using my mother’s. All my numbers are gone. Okay. Excuse me, sir. I found your cellphone on the floor of the car. Where is it? I gave it to your mother. That's strange. Why didn't she give it to me? Girls, they're here. Are you ready? Watch closely, but don't speak. Maybe you will learn something. And then, if you like, you can join next week. There's a group of Koreans coming in. Do you speak Korean? We've been worried. Did you find my cellphone? I told you before. I don’t know where it is. All I care about is your happiness. My apologies to you, sir. Thank you for coming, but I can’t stay.

In the bar at 7 o'clock? -Yeah. -Good. What's that smell? This is a smoking room. I asked for a non-smoker. Okay, sir, no trouble. We’ll get you a new room. God I hate that stench. What are you doing? What's that about? I like to do it. What are you going to do about it? What are you saying? What woman? Who are you calling a cheap woman? You can't say that. Remember yesterday? That short guy was mine. He liked me a lot. Why did you take him away from me? Only a cross-eyed midget would marry a cheap woman like you. What's going on? Why are you fighting?

Yes sir. -Another one sir? -No. This is not the first time I’ve called. I know she’s there. Don’t give me that. I know who you are. You’re Chin’s sister. You’d better tell me where she is.

This is Anna's room. Anna? Yeah, Anna's - she lives here. She's autistic, do you know what that means? It means, you're going to spend a lot of time with her. You know what? Let me show you your room. My room? You know what? Let me show you my office first. Who do you think you're dealing with? Please understand. I'll come back next week when you have the rest. There's one thing we can try. One of your daughters. Sit here. Don't talk. Hey! We just got here. Didn't get a chance to call you from the airport. Close the door, honey. What is this? This is Phuong Ly. Hello! Where's the one in the photo? The one that I picked? -Oh that. -Because that's not her. Well, that was just like a reference. Those girls weren't real. Don't worry, because this one is great with kids. You do know, Mitch, as a liar, you suck! In the minute my back is turned, it's classic. Just classic! I don’t know what you expect from me. That is not a work horse! That is a wet dream! Connie, no. They were all lookers. She wasn't even the best pick. Nobody’s going to believe she’s a maid! See? That's it. Nobody’s gonna see her, she stays in the condo. You pig. You did her already, didn't you? Connie, come on. That's not nice and it's not true. Look, you signed on for this. You said it was a good idea. I agreed to the one in the photo, not this one! And I told you those photos were bullcrap! You call Vu, I don't want her here. Call Vu? Oh? Okay! And what am I supposed to tell him? I don’t care! Just get her out of the house! You see, that sounds real smart because I'm just about to close this deal. Probably the only deal I'm going to close for the month, a $50,000 dollar commission, and you want me to act like an idiot. When are you gonna stop screwing around and get a real job? Oh, you mean like you? Oh, right. Yeah, because let me see? Like your brilliant condo deal, yeah, this one's due in eleven days. If we don't make this payment, we lose our deposit. I mean, you're welcome to take over if you got a better idea. Are you actually trying to make this my fault? See, that's it. I can't win with you. I go all the way to Vietnam, I find you help, I have to stay in a crappy hotel. How about a little thanks? Thanks? Thanks my bum! And you! You listen here you, you little piece of meat. -That is my husband! -She doesn't understand you. You’re not the wife around here, I am! You are the cleaning lady! -Why don't you just leave here alone, alright? -You're a baby sitter! And you know what's really funny? You thought you got yourself a catch. Well, let me tell you something about my prick of a husband– Get your freaking hands off me! I want her to know where she stands. Slapping her around ain't going to help. No, that's your job. I want her out of the house! Stay there. Where am I suppose to take her? I don't know! Look at her, look at how weak she is. She looks like she has some disease. Okay, so I’ll take her to get checked out, I’ll take her to a doctor. Are you satisfied? Don't be so stupid! Nobody even knows she’s in the building! I don't want any record of her here. Then you figure it out. But I don't wanna hear any more of that, "I can't handle the monster all by myself" bullcrap. Hi, my name is Phuong Ly. Nice to meet you. You can start by mopping the floor. Take it. Also, around the back and then get the wall. If she starts to tear, take it away. Do you understand? What have I told you about tearing? No tearing. You're Anna, right? Anna banana. My name's Ly. Can you say it? Phuong Ly. The doors are all locked. All of them. Connie likes to keep them lock, so Anna doesn't run away or get into anything. Can you show me outside? Well, no. Your place is inside. You don't go outside, you understand? Do you understand? I'm sure you do. You want me to mail that? Crap! Did you give her the pills? You forgot, didn't you? International service is blocked on this line. Well unlike you, I just worked a 16-hour day, you peckerhead I don’t need your crap. Fine. That’s what I get for being concerned about your health. Get up! Get up! Jesus Christ! Look what you've done! Get in here! You are not going to sit in the couch anymore! How many times have I told you, I cannot keep doing this! Clean this up! I cannot take this anymore! How many times do I have to tell you! What is wrong with you?! Can you put soap and water in there? Don't you know anything?! Get over here. If you cannot keep on my couch without pissing on it then you're not going in there anymore! Why are you just standing there? You get back over here! That is what you get! You're making me do this to you! I have a little sister just about your age. Anna banana. Can you say my name? Phuong Ly. Can you call my name? Phuong Ly. You know what time it is? Did you give her the pills? What pills? Aw, well, isn’t that cute? No, no, no, no. Leave her alone. Just be glad we're getting a decent night's sleep for a change. Where are you going?

Nice to meet you. You speak Vietnamese? I only know a few phrases. Okay. Okay. Well, the news is mixed, I'm afraid. She's got some cervical bruising, and a few lacerations, a mild internal edema and an inflammation of the uterine lining. And that concerns me a little bit. Do you understand what I'm saying? I'd like to see you in three weeks if the pain continues. Okay? What about the STD's or anything contagious? Well, the lab results won't be in until Friday but I can call you and we can discuss it then. -Alright, take care. -Good. Thanks for coming. Mr. Peterson, it appears I don't have your phone number.

Mother, I'm staying at the top of a tall building near the beach. Mother, I have to go now. I will call you later. What is going on? She drugged me. I just got a call from the cops. Some guy from Vietnam has been calling asking about her. Oh, that's great! I said I didn't know her. Crap! How did they locate me? God darn it Mitch! Can't we just sell her off? And at least we can get some cash to pay for some of our credit cards? What's up man? You need another wife? No. I have trouble with the one you already got me. Complaint department, 3rd floor. No, this one's no good. And I invested a lot of money into her. I'm just the middle man. You'll get a grip. Take her to Saigon. I want you to get rid of her. I know there's a market for it. I want a good price. It's okay, it's okay. It's all set. I'm not sure but– check with the Chief. Take a look at this. Mr. Peterson. God damn it Mitch! Can’t you do anything right? You should've put more in. It's the freaking cops. Alright. I'll handle it just get her out of here. Just a minute! You again. Sorry to disturb you. I’m just having some trouble with my daughter. She’s not your daughter. All right, my niece. But I consider her my daughter. Going up? No! Has your husband been to Vietnam? Vietnam? I can barely get him off the couch. Sounds like she wants out. Go ahead. Let her out. Hello, sweetie. You recognize her? No. Phuong Ly. What’s that, sweetie? Phuong Ly. Vu! Where is she? She’s asleep? No, I gave her some Valium. You know, calm her down.

We're running out of options here. Get rid of her! Look, I don’t care what you do with her or where you dump her, but you’re not bringing her back to the apartment. Well they haven't search the condo, have they? Not yet. Look, you need to break that cage down and get it out there before they come back with a search warrant. And how am I suppose to do that? Well, just figure it out! Who are you? It doesn't matter who I am. Anna! Open the door, it's me! Anna, it's Ly! Anna! Open the door! I know your dad’s not here. His car’s not in the garage. Where's your mother? Anna, I came here for you. You want to go away? Well go to together, okay? Okay, good. I’ve had enough of you. Broward Country Police ruled the death of Mitchell P. Mallory a suicide. His wife Cornerlia died 3 years later of liver cancer linked to alcohol abuse. Anna Wellington, foster child in the care of the Mallories was reported missing following his death. Phong Ly Nguyen moved to Orange Country and married a Vietnamese-American convience store owner, and after working in the family business for 2 years, she opened her own nail salon. The couple is raising 3 kids. One of them is autistic but, although Caucasian for some reason, they declared pride of their family. Between 2001 and 2008, marriages between foreigners and local Vietnamese girls, mostly from impoverished villages, have risen from 7,600 to 36,400 per year. Many are facilitated through unlicensed "marriage agencies" that often operate under the cover of different type of business, mostly "boarding houses." Many of the girls are taken by their husbands into a country without any knowledge of culture and language. While many of these marriages undoubtedly result intact families, a growing number of women experience suffering and isolation, with many cases of abuse and and a number of suicides.
