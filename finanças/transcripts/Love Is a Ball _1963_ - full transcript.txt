(MUSIC PLAYING) -(SPEAKING FRENCH) -Yes. All right, all right! Will you tell me, where am I gonna get $3,500? -That is not my problem! -I haven't got $3,500. I've no credit, nobody gets credit! -Strictly cash business. -All right, all right. -Like the sign says... -You, all right... -...tell them no credit. -Yes... I've read the sign. Listen, you trusted me with the propeller casing. -Oh, that was... -Why can't you trust me with this? -Well, that was for $20. -Why not? -I don't trust my mother... -You're my friend? -...for 3,500. -Yeah. His name is John Davis, American. His financial statement. Listen, I have to have this boat or I can't make a living. -You know that, don't you? -Aye! You know... Talk to him, honey, you tell him. (BOTH SPEAKING FRENCH) Hold it, whoa, hey, forget it, I don't know, forget it! -I try to help. -I know. But you see, I'm sorry, Johnny. Yes, I'm... I'm sorry, too, but... (SIGHS) Never mind. Thanks a lot, honey. I'll figure something out. I don't know what. He's owned the boat for two years, a charter boat. Rents out by week or month to the tourists. Priory. I beg your pardon, sir. You are Mr. John Davis? Yeah. Sir, a gentleman I represent would like to engage your services. Look, I'm sorry, pal, my boat is out of commission. -No boat. -The use of your boat is not required, just you, sir. What do you mean? My employer's card, sir. If you will be there at noon tomorrow, it will all be explained to you. -Good day, sir. -Good day. Can't you give me some inkling of what the fellow wants? It will all be explained to you, sir. 12:00, sharp. Morning. Hi. Gentlemen, please. Mr. Pimm gets very angry when people aren't punctual. Oh, after you. Make yourselves comfortable. Can I get you a drink? Oh, yes, Cinzano, please. -For you? -How about a beer? Well, hello, this is jolly, isn't it? Hey, does anybody know why we're here? I haven't the vaguest. -Whiskey's good, though. -(CHUCKLES) -My name's Soames. -Davis. -Zoltan is mine. -How do you do? PIMM: Ah. Gentlemen, good afternoon, how nice of you all to come. I am Mr. Pimm, how do you do? -How do you do? -Hi. This is Janine, my secretary, and this is my friend, Monsieur Gaspard du Clouseau. Good evening. Good evening. I have a very tall. Ah, you have a very tall what? GASPARD: Yes. I'm afraid Gaspard's English is even more fragmentary than mine. Yes, I like your Coca-Cola. PIMM: (LAUGHING) Dear boy, that's beautiful. Can we offer you gentlemen a drink? Oh, Carlo has your order, good. -Thank you. -Janine. Thank you. To your very good health, gentlemen. Well, um, excuse me, but why are we here? Do you mind telling us? You'll find out in time. Well, shall we sit down? Ah. Carlo, you can serve the lunch. And bring the Champagne. I hope you gentlemen like Champagne. -Oh, yes. -I love Champagne. -CARLO: Sir. -Yes? Oh! Would you excuse us, please? We'll be with you in just a moment. Yeah, say, uh, this fellow Pimm, what's his racket? Oh, and I drink Coca-Cola to your President Coolidge. Man, you're no help at all, are you? Thank you. She's right on schedule, just as our man in New York predicted. Ah, there is the girl. And her grandmother, sir. But I don't see her uncle. Oh, check your report. (PAPARAZZI SHOUTING) (ALL SPEAKING FRENCH) MAN: Whoo. The report says definitely Doctor Gump accompanied them. Here he comes. Absolutely no pictures. All pictures have to be cleared through the news services. Tracey, get these photographers away. Get away! Back up the car and get up to the villa. What a pompous ass he is. Huh. Met him in Boston once. It was like shaking hands with a pickle. Well, we're ready. Our quarry has arrived. Come. Again, my apologies, gentlemen. It was unavoidable. Shall we get on with our lunch? I want to engage your services, gentlemen. For various reasons, I want you to help me with Gaspard, my protege here. I want to groom him, to polish him, and teach him the refinements of good living. Why? Uh, that, uh, Mr. Davis, is my own business. You want to make a proper gentleman of him, is that it? Well, with all the tutors there are about, why pick on me? I'm just a humble musician. Oh, but you haven't always been a flautist with a dreadful quartet, Mr. Soames. Priory. Julian Soames, fellow of All Souls, Oxford, 1950. Author of The Definitive Linguist. Speaks eight languages, including Swahili. Left Oxford to follow a woman named... (LAUGHING NERVOUSLY) Yes, well, that's enough, isn't it? PIMM: Eh, that will do, Priory. I will want you to stuff Gaspard like a sausage with your Oxford manner and charm. I will want you to teach him flawless English, eh? Hmm, mmm. Mediocre. (CHUCKLING) You won't have an easy job, I think. As for you, Mr. Davis... Wait a minute, listen, you got the wrong man. I'm no school teacher. Oh, you have some, ah, qualifications for my purposes. No, no. Priory. John Lathrop Davis, from Wyoming. Cowhand on various ranches until he was 22. In 1954, began racing cars. Winner at Indianapolis Speedway. Winner at Sebring. Winner at Le Mans, 1958. Winner at International Grand Prix... -Thank you, Priory. -The list goes on and on. I'm sure it does. I will want you to teach Gaspard the finer points of driving and horsemanship. Look, I'm in the charter boat business, remember? With no boat? Oh. Do this little job for me, Mr. Davis, and I shall see to it that your boat is put right again. I'll pay all the repair bills and throw in a bonus. What do you say? Well, that's it, gentlemen, will you join us? My pleasure, monsieur. Soames? Sounds like a lovely vacation, I'm in. Mr. Davis? (SIGHS) Well, I need my boat. Welcome to the Pimm family. Gentlemen, to a successful venture. Well, really, Monsieur Pimm, I've wasted my whole day! 17 villas I've shown you, and none of them suit you! Patience, madame, patience. The gentleman I represent is very fussy about where he lives. Well, if this doesn't suit your fussy friend, I give up! I warn you, the rent is outrageous. But wait till you see the gardens in the rear. ...a wonderful view. And the prettiest gardens on the Riviera. And there are two swimming pools. Magnificent! I think we're getting warm now. Yes, you're also getting into high rent. Seven million, five hundred thousand francs, a month. It's only money. Now, if the kitchens and the interior are satisfactory, -I think we might be interested, madame. -Very well. A great connoisseur of the old world of cooking, Monsieur Maurice Zoltan from Paris. Ah, but of course, I've heard of him. Good. Well, Zoltan, what do you think? Good ovens. Well-planned storage. Yes, I'm satisfied. Good. Well, then, there is only the question of gardeners and, uh, maintenance. And now, this room here, this is the dining room. It just has been redecorated and repainted, you see? Well, Madame Fernier, it will do. -Yes. -We'll take it immediately. What do you mean, "immediately"? Well, you see, the Grand Duke is arriving on the 14th, and it means a tremendous... Did you say "Grand Duke"? But Mr. Pimm, really! Oh! Oh, Janine, what have I done? You know how the Grand Duke hates notoriety. But you can trust me, I am like the Sphinx, my lips are sealed. Tell me, which Grand Duke is it? Oh, no, no, no, I'm sorry, uh... Well, as long as you have let the cat out of the bag... I suppose you're right. Well, he's the Grand Duke Gaspard Isidro du Clouseau from Barcelona. (GASPING) Oh. Shh. I know we can trust you. But of course, don't worry about our little secret. My lips are sealed. -Goodbye, my dear. -Goodbye. (SPEAKING FRENCH) Um, I'll send you the lease for you to sign. (SPEAKING FRENCH) By 3:00, she'll have the word all over the Riviera, eh? Eh? (CHUCKLING) Gentlemen? Well, then, we have our new home! What do you think of it? Magnificent. Well, we have lots to do and precious little time to do it. Uh, Johnny, uh, how does your American expression go? Uh, let's, um, let's, uh... -Let's get with it? -That's it! Let's get with it! (MOVERS SPEAKING FRENCH) "'Oh, very well,' "say the mother cat. "'But ."'you have lose your mittens "'and you are "'bad little kittens.'" Not lose, lost. -Losed. -Lost. -Losed. -Lost. -Losed. -Lost. -Losed. -Lost. -Losed. -Lost. -Losed. -Lost. Losed. Excusez-moi... -GASPARD: Oh! -What is it, Gaspard? Oh! That mean mother. She sent all the little kittens to bed with no milk, just because they losed their mittens. Oh, Gaspard, for heaven's sake. (MUSIC PLAYING) Gaspard, please, follow the rhythm. Follow me! Now, listen to me. You step one, one, one... Oh, that's marvelous! -Oh, how beautiful! -All right, get in! Really? Johnny will teach you how to drive it. Ah, drive it away! (ENGINE REVVING LOUDLY) (TIRES SCREECHING) Gaspard! -This... This is a horse. -Oh, yes? Oh, he won't hurt you, come here. -Go ahead, pet him, c'mon. -Really? Yeah, go ahead. -All right, all right, Johnny. -Yeah, that's it. -Yeah. -See? He likes you. -He likes me? Oh, uh... -Sure, he does. ...I like... I like you... I like you, too. Fine, well, you're gonna get along just fine with him. -Now look, you hold on here. -Oh, yes. Oh, no, you better take this one. You ride this one, and I'm gonna show you how... -He likes me? -Yeah, I think he likes you. We'll find out in a minute. -Now, you get on from the left side... -Yes? -See? Right? Okay? -Yes. That's very simple. "We ride "the brown horse." Huh? (CHUCKLING) Marvelous. PIMM: There's no hurry. One, one, two... (INDISTINCT CONVERSATIONS) What's the matter? Uh, nothing, I... "Do may also be used to call special attention "to the action of the verb." -Sample! -Uh... "Do, uh, "help me," instead of just "help me." (SIGHING) No, no, Gaspard, please, you're not nibbling at a chicken leg. You don't seem to get the idea at all that we are trying to teach you how to make love, gently, see? And uh, whatever you do, don't... Don't rush. Enjoy it, hmm? This... This is a very nice place. From there on, it's all good. Now, let's see you do it. May I talk to you, Mr. Pimm, please? -PIMM: All right. -Excuse me. Well, what is it? Perhaps I could practice on someone else, Mr. Pimm. It's embarrassing with Janine. -I don't see why! -Shh. She's here to help. She's one of the family. Why should it be embarrassing? I don't know, it... It just is. Nonsense, go back to work. And stop worrying. Go on, go on, be with her. All right. Oh, Johnny, that's beautiful! And you make it look so easy! (GASPARD SIGHING) Do you think I'll be able to do it, Johnny? Of course you can. Whoa. -Ready? -Yes. -Get on. -All right. That's it, see? That's the way. -All right. -Here you go. All right now, keep your arm high now. -Remember what I taught you. -All right, Johnny. -All right, let's go. -Here I go, Johnny. -Here I go, Johnny! -Yes! Keep your arm high there, Gaspard, high! Johnny! I think you better take it first, 'cause I... I'm afraid to ruin that beautiful piece of machinery. Okay. (TIRES SCREECHING) Go this way! Getting better, Mr. Pimm. Yesterday, I was worse! -Terrible. -(CHUCKLING) "Then the hackney rattled off, "and she was left alone in the wind at the corner." The end. (SIGHING) Only the beginning. It's never the end, keep reading. (LAUGHING) Wonderful, Gaspard! (TIRES SCREECHING) I'm sorry, Johnny. Congratulations. (SNEEZING) I have hay... Hay fever, Johnny. (SNEEZING) 3500 RPM, Johnny, I should... (SNEEZING) -Bless you. -Thank you, Johnny. -Oh, I hope I didn't... -Oh, good morning. Have you had a nice lesson? -Very nice. -Yes? -(SNEEZING) -Hey, what are you people always looking at through this thing? -Huh? -Lunch is ready. Shall we go in? PIMM: Well, Priory, good luck. And you'll keep me posted, now? Indeed I will, sir. -Goodbye. -Goodbye. GASPARD: Much better, I think... Ah, let's have our lunch. I am famished. What's Priory doing dressed up as a chauffeur? Uh... Oh, he is uh, leaving us for a while. He has taken up another job. He's leaving us, just like that, how come? Heh. Well, I wonder what Zoltan has prepared for us today? -Janine, listen. -Mm-hmm? "Fame is a food that dead men eat. "I have no stomach for such meat. "But friendship is a noble thing." -Isn't that beautiful? -It's lovely. I learned that today. Henry Austin Dobson. Isn't that right, Julian? Yeah, that's right. Yes, and here's another one by Elizabeth Barrett Browning. "How do I love thee? "Let me count the ways." Dear boy, not during lunch, hm? Let's enjoy our food, there's a good lad. You've turned him on, now you can't shut him off, can you? Uh, listen, my dear friend, let me tell you something. The art of conversation is just to sort of exchange ideas, it isn't to give a lecture. (CHUCKLING) I know, Johnny, but now that I've learned all these wonderful things! -JOHNNY: Yeah, but you don't... -For instance, do you know that our knowledge of the Etruscan civilization, -due to the lack of literary... -No, I don't. ...remains does not hamper our knowledge of them so much due to the paintings that are left behind. Now, from this, we can deduct that they enjoyed life, and actually... This tastes dreadfully, dreadfully, take it away. -I'm sorry, sir. -Take it away! Oh, why can't we locate a decent cook in this house? Look... What I found down by the Oberian this morning. A genuine Callophrys avis. Isn't he gorgeous? Now, must you mount butterflies while I'm having breakfast, uh, Mathilda? The food in this house is bad enough without you sticking pins into those animals. -Yes, what is it, Stacy? -STACY: The applicants are here in answer to your advertisement, sir. -What advertisement? -The chauffeur's, sir. Ah, yes, all right, show them in. Come this way, will you, please? Monsieur will see you now. Let's have a look at you. Mm-hmm. You all speak English? (ALL SPEAKING FRENCH) What's wrong with the French people? They don't have the common courtesy to speak English. I do, sir, I am English. Oh? I suppose you have some sort of recommendation. I have his references here, sir. Yes, according to the letterhead, Sir James Smith Bingham, fellow of the Royal Society. The Royal Society of what? Sir James was a naturalist, sir. Naturalist? The Royal Society of Naturalists. Well, I'm a naturalist, too! I must show you my collection. Yes, well, we haven't hired the man, yet, Mathilda. MATHILDA: Oh, nonsense, of course he's hired! Stacy, show this nice man his quarters and work out some sort of wages with him. -Ah, what's your name? -Priory, madam. Thank you, madam, thank you, sir. GUMP: Yes. Mathilda, I wish you would stick to sticking pins into those colored beasts and let the household chores to me! -Good morning! Good morning, dear. -Morning, darling. -Good morning, Uncle Chris. -Good morning. Millie! That chauffeur we just hired, he worked for a naturalist, Sir James... Uh, something or other, isn't that wonderful? Well, that's lovely! Where's my peanut butter? MATHILDA: Oh, it's just my lucky day. I wish it were mine. I can't seem to get that darn fuel system put back together again. Oh. Now, Millie, I don't wish to sound like an old maid aunt... -But you're going to. -Now you stop and listen. But I've just paid the bill for that racing car you bought, and I think that $24,000 is absolutely shocking to pay for that... (STAMMERING) That plaything! It's not a plaything. It's a Cooper Climax, and it's the finest piece of machinery made in the world! I mean, you have four perfectly good cars already. Well, not like this one, I don't. Well, what are you going to use it for? Oh, didn't I tell you? I'm going to race it in the International Grand Prix -next week. -You are? -You are not! -Oh! Did you hear what she said, Mathilda? I think she's lost her mind! You'll get yourself killed! Well, let her do what she wants to, dear, if it makes her happy. Yes, it'll make me very happy. There's a great deal more to life than just making yourself happy. Self-gratification is a disease -that preys on rich young girls like you... -Ooh, ooh! Now you stop that and listen! Are you going to start that whole marriage lecture -all over again? -I most certainly am. Have you ever once considered that you're depriving your dear grandmother, who loves you dearly, (STAMMERING) the pleasure of a grandchild? Oh, Granny, not you, too? Well, I never said anything about it, but of course every woman dreams of cuddling and caring for a dear little baby again. Well. Gee, if I... If I really thought it meant that much to you, I... You'd make me the happiest woman in the world! You see? It's time you started thinking of doing something for your grandmother. Well, I never really thought about being a mother before. I'd probably be very good at it. -Yes, you would. -Excuse me, miss. The man from the garage has just brought this. Oh, good, my carburetor! Oh, for goodness sakes, Stacy, it's not gonna bite you. You know, uh, marriage and babies might be fun for a change. She'll need careful guidance in choosing the right husband. -Hmm. -Millicent with a baby. Won't that be heaven? JOHNNY: All right, all right, now try the backhand. All right, Johnny, why... Why the backhand? -That's it. -All right. -No, no. -Why, Johnny? Keep your eye on the ball, hmm? -Choose this mallet, Johnny. Look. -Yeah. Well, you keep trying, that's it. Oh, that's great. All right, you're on your own now, Gaspy. All right, Johnny. All right, Johnny. Here I go. Here I go. (GRUNTING) If you could only cook like you play gin rummy. (CHUCKLING) ZOLTAN: How's Gaspard doing with the horse? Well, one thing I'll say for this guy, he's really trying. -If you want my advice... -Will you stop talking and deal? All right, all right, take it easy. You playing gin rummy? What's this? Hey, come here. Come on. PRIORY: And the letterhead did the trick. "Sir James Smith Bingham." She took the bait beautifully, and I've got the job. Shows the value of planning, eh, Janine? Now, a rare bit of luck, sir. The girl's taken it into her head to get married. -No! -I heard them on the terrace. This Doctor Gump's going to look for eligible young men. He wants someone of breeding and nobility. PIMM: Oh, isn't that obliging of the old goat? Well, we have Gaspard for him. We trained him, uh, we taught him how to ride, how to speak... Well, now, so that's what you're up to, huh? All these weeks. That's why we're here. Now, gentlemen, gentlemen, please. I don't know what you heard, but, uh... There must be some misunderstanding. Oh, no, oh, no, I don't think there's any misunderstanding, actually, do you? -No. -No, I don't think so. No. Who were you gonna stick him with? How dare you use that tone with Mr. Pimm? Of all the horrid, slimy... (ALL PROTESTING) Please, I just said, "Who is he going "to stick him with," what's wrong with that? Please, calm down, I... I can't blame him, really. Well, then, you have stumbled onto our little hobby. (CHUCKLING) I suppose it's no good denying. Hobby, he calls it, blimey. I've heard of girls called some disgraceful names before, but hobby? Not at all what you think, Julian. Have you ever stopped to consider how many wealthy women there are in this world? I can't say I have. Well, I can tell you, there are literally hundreds and hundreds of the little darlings. And every year brings a new crop of the dear young things whose fathers have left sensible wills. Mr. Pimm doesn't go about sticking people, as you so badly put it. On the contrary, Mr. Pimm has put together 74 perfect marriages all over the world. Ah, gentlemen, would you follow me, please? Let me show you. Where the pins indicate, see? Buenos Aires, New York, Paris, Madrid. The entire world is our nuptial office. And look. Look at these happy couples... And their offspring. How many was it at last count, Janine? -112? -JANINE: 114. Ooh, yes, yes, I forgot. Uh, the Hiphoff twins in Portugal. So, don't stand there looking smug and condemning. We are proud of our contribution to happiness. Well, how about that? So, that's the big secret you have stumbled upon. My delight in life, my hobby, if you will. Arranging suitable marriages between people of taste and breeding. -And money. -My dear Johnny, man does not live by wedding cake alone. I admit, uh, I accept a sizeable consideration from the groom once the marriage is consummated. What do you think of that? He's running a matrimonial bureau! A tip of the old skimmer to you, Pimm. It's absolutely brilliant! Thank you, but, but... I am not an opportunist. Oh, no, no, no, if I... If I find that the couples are not compatible during courtship, I desist at once and sent the chap packing. Uh, you know, there's one thing I don't understand, though. How come you picked this fellow Gaspard of all people? Well, Gaspard happens to be the Grand Duke Gaspard Isidro du Clouseau, the last descendant of the great Sultan of Granada. Gaspard a Grand Duke, are you kidding? That poor clod? JANINE: He is not a clod! I think you are all being dreadful to him. He is trying his best. Let us say he has come a long way under your tutelage, gentlemen. As a matter of fact, I think we are about ready now to arrange a meeting between boy and girl. ZOLTAN: But, uh, who is the girl, monsieur? Eh, her name is Millicent Mehaffey, an American whose father left her 40 million. (WHISTLING) Exactly. So we are trying to arrange a... A marriage between Gaspard and Miss $40 Million. Anyone want to pull out? SOAMES: I think it's delightful. Gaspy'll be my own little Galatea. PIMM: Johnny? Well, why not him? She's gotta marry somebody. Eh, Monsieur Pimm, exactly what is my role, if you please? Oh, my dear fellow, you, you are the bait to catch her uncle, Doctor Gump. Dreadful man. But we have found his, uh, weakness. He fancies himself a gourmet. ZOLTAN: Oh, really? So you will be tickling his palate. And to be sure that we know his whereabouts, Priory here has been engaged as their chauffeur. JOHNNY: I bet I know why. Yes, Johnny. Thank you, Janine. In my hobby, I have found one inflexible rule. If you want to know what goes on in a house, you have to have somebody downstairs to keep you posted. Well, we're all set. Now we start Phase Number Two. The meeting. Well, I got to hand it to you, man, you got things all figured out. Why not? After all, we are superior people. What could possibly go wrong? (LAUGHING) (CUP SHATTERS) Good Lord! Johnny! I hit it! Oh, what a tragedy! When everything was going so well. I am awfully sorry, really I am, -I don't know what to say. -It's all right, it's all right, it's all right. Don't worry, it wasn't your fault. Unforeseen events. (SIGHS) We'll make some adjustments. We'll have to find a new chauffeur to replace Priory in the Mehaffeys' house. Eh? Oh, not me, sir. I can cook, but I can't drive. Oh. Soames? I can't do either. Uh-uh, no. No, no, mmm-mmm. -Hi. -Hi. Do you know what you're doing here now? -Yes, I do. -I see. Well, you leave that fuel line there, you're gonna be in all kinds of trouble. You know that, don't you? I happen to know what I'm doing. Who are you? Well, I just might be the new chauffeur. Well, they don't need any. Oh? Well, do you know what they might need? They might need somebody to keep chambermaids like you away from high powered Cooper engines like this. Look, don't tell me how to work on this car! -I know it very well. -You got this thing all fouled up here, honey. You don't leave a fuel line laying there... Don't call me "honey"! All right. What a nut. GUMP: Broke his arm, now how could that be? We just hired the man yesterday. JOHNNY: Yes, well, it was a very peculiar accident. He was... He was hit by a polo ball. -Now who the devil's playing polo around here? -What, I, I... That's the wildest story I ever heard, and who are you? Just walk off the streets and expect us to hire you? Yes, well, I'm Priory's American cousin, sir. As you can see, if you look at that letter, that I have worked for some pretty good families, and I think I've pleased them. I, I'm, uh, very dependable. I'm, uh, very careful. I don't drink or, uh... Or what? Why, um, I... I just, uh... I don't really do very much of anything. What does that mean, "I don't do much of anything"? Uh, it means that... I'm sure that I don't... I wouldn't do anything that would be objectionable to you. (WHISPERING) What does she do here? (WHISPERING) She owns the place. -No. -Owns the place. That answer your question? Yes, it does. What are you whispering about? You're not thinking of hiring him, are you? I'll take care of the affairs of the help, young lady. (SIGHS) I'd like to have a French chauffeur. Your grandmother doesn't speak French, and you know that. Okay. But all the American chauffeurs we've had, um, always tried to seduce me. Millicent! (CHUCKLING) Well, it's true! Sir, listen. I give you my word, I'm just a clean-cut American boy who likes apple pie and root beer. You see? (SIGHING) All right, I'll give you a try. You can take me to the Hotel Metropole. If I like the way you drive, I'll get you a uniform, and we'll keep you on. Now you can get the Bentley and bring it out front. Yes, sir. That's a nice lad. I think he'll work out fine. I don't like him. We're leaving now. I'm taking Gump to the Metropole Hotel in Beaulieu. Very good, Johnny, I'm on my way. Yes, yes, I'll bring Maurice. Ah, Carlo, get Zoltan. Tell him the curtain is going up. (LAUGHING) Oh, it's so easy to make money when you're clever. It's embarrassing. I know that you know everyone here... -Oh, we certainly do. -And I want a man of breeding and good family. That's a difficult order, Christian. -Oh? -The Cote d'Azur has been ravaged. -Am I right, CiCi? -Ah! Ravaged. There aren't any choice men around anymore. Well, listen, I rented the Villa Florentine to a Grand Duke the other day. All Grand Dukes are decrepit old men. Tell you what you should do, Christian, give a party. -A party? -Yes. A real, huge party. The kind we used to have on the Riviera. -Yes! -That will attract all the available young men around. How about tomorrow afternoon? -Good! -Now you girls -spread the word, mmm-hmm? -Oh, we will. And I'll order a truckload of Champagne, and we'll have it on the terrace where... -Now, what's the matter? -I think that's the most beautiful smell I've ever smelled. (LAUGHING) Excuse me, eh, monsieur! Uh, what is that? It's a creation of mine, sir. Gigot d'agneau a la Roquebrune, with very small and tasty champignons. Gigot d'agneau, oh, it sounds beautiful. Bring me some, would you please, chef? -I beg your pardon? -Excuse me, sir, but this gentlemen doesn't work here. -He's a friend of mine. -Why, but it's Monsieur Pimm! Pimmsy! What in the world are you doing here? My dear. Darling, I didn't see you there. You are as beautiful as ever. Breathtaking! You're such a liar, but don't stop, I adore it. -Now, you know CiCi, don't you? -Yes, yes, of course I do. And this is an old friend of mine from America, Doctor Christian Gump. -Monsieur Etienne Pimm. -How do you do? How do you do? May I present my friend, Monsieur Maurice Zoltan. Zoltan? The Maurice Zoltan who wrote the famous cookbook? -Right. -Well, this is absolutely fantastic. -Would you join us, please? -Oh, thank you. I'm sorry I was so abrupt with you, but, uh, Monsieur Zoltan doesn't work here, you know. -Oh? -He just came to prepare my lunch. He's a friend of the chef's here. Monsieur Zoltan is cooking for the Grand Duke -I was telling you about. -Right. Here, sir, do try some of these. Oh, thank you, Zoltan. Oh, please, now, won't you sit down? Oh, thank you very much. Well, this is really a pleasant surprise. Do you know, I've read your cookbook for years? It's the very best of its kind. -Absolutely brilliant! -Oh, thank you, sir. Are you interested in good food? Well, I'm sort of an amateur. Nothing quite as grand as you, sir. You know, you're a very famous person in cooking circles. Mmm... Ah. The aroma is surpassed only by the taste. Absolutely brilliant. You're very kind, sir. As you're interested in food, I must tell you, this morning in the market I found the most perfect white doves. -GUMP: Ah. -Very rare, now, -you know, these days... -Yes. And for the dinner tonight, I will prepare salmis de palombe, white doves with red wine sauce. It's a country dish from the Basque Pyrenees. ...and also, just a drop of cognac. -Very old cognac. -Delicious! Scientific as well as artistic, my dear Zoltan. Ah, Davis, I won't be needing you. I'm dining with Mr. Pimm at his villa. ZOLTAN: You know, in Perigord, they... (SPEAKING FRENCH) Oh, Michelline, go empty all the water out of my carafe. (SPEAKING FRENCH) Now, I don't know why you're being so finicky, Davis. -I just don't like to... -It's only a chauffeur's uniform. -I don't like to wear... -Well, well, well, take this one, try that on. -I... I... -Is there something I can do for you, Miss? My carafe was empty, and I was just dying of thirst. (SPEAKING FRENCH) Did you ever just scream for a plain, ordinary old glass of water? Must be horrible to be lost in the desert where there is no water, don't you imagine? Ah, merci. -Ah. -Is that better, Miss? Yes, thank you. Anything you require, Miss. -Ugh. -That's the best one. -No, I don't like it. -Why not? Well, I... Why not? I just don't wear hats, that's all. Well, you have to wear a hat. Why? Because all my chauffeurs wear hats. Oh, I see, well, then, you will have the distinction of having the only chauffeur on the Riviera that does not wear a hat. You'll find the chauffeur's quarters at the back of the house. Go through the door at the end of the corridor... Never mind, Stacy, I'm going that way. I'll show him. Follow me. -What do they call you? -Davis. Davis what? No, it's not Davis what, it's John Davis. It's... My first name is John. Well, this is pretty ghastly, isn't it? Oh, this'll do just fine. Well, it's so small and depressing. I don't see how anybody could live in it. I know what I'll do! -What? -I'll knock out this wall for you and have it made into a sitting room. And then we'll have it painted and decorated... Hey, wait a sec, come on, please. I'm just the chauffeur, remember? Just stop worrying about me, will ya, huh? I'm fine, this is just... Just great. (SINGING) Why are you a chauffeur, Davis? Why not? It's a good job. Three square meals a day, drive real nice cars, work for a very pretty girl like you. I'm happy. Well, there's a great deal more to life than just being happy, you know. Oh, well, I'll settle for just being happy. What, are you gonna go through life a happy, grinning boob of a chauffeur? Why don't you make something of yourself? Will you excuse me, please? Look, if you wanna stick around, that's all right with me, but I've got to kind of unpack and straighten up around here, do you mind? -Are you dismissing me? -No, I'm not dismissing you. In case nobody told you, I'm the high mucky-muck around here. I'm Millicent the nut, I'm the heiress, and I give the orders. All right, come on now, please, let's not start out by fighting and raising our voices to each other. You just let me enjoy my life, and I'll let you enjoy your life, and we'll get along just fine. I mean, not that your life is anything to speak about, you know, of course. Uh, what is it, $40 million, a very nice home, good looks? But cheer up, honey, I'm sure things will get a lot better. Davis. Do me a favor? Yeah, what? Wash all the cars. Ah, wash all the cars? All of them. Inspection at 5:30, and they'd better be ready or else! Or else what? Ever wax a Bentley by moonlight, honey? Not only the casserole, but the fish de Boux was absolutely brilliant. Thanks to my new opening, see? Look, look what's coming. Good heavens. Look at this. What is it, Zoltan? Custard Fantastique. Shaped in the image of your Boston Insurance Company. Ah, Zoltan. I'm deeply touched. I don't know quite what to say. -Bon appetit, monsieur. -Bon appetit. PIMM: Merci, Maurice. Etienne, what a magnificent meal. Tell me, do you eat this way every night? Every meal is an adventure with Zoltan. Etienne, dear friend, let me thank you for a most memorable evening. And I want you to thank your friend, the Grand Duke. Oh, my dear Christian, it's been great fun for me. Finding a fellow like you, who loves good table and good talk, ah, believe me... Come on, here we go. -The other arm. -He'll never believe me, Janine, he'll never believe me. I want to... Yes... Oh, come on. -No, no, no, just carry it. -Oh, just carry it. -Come on. Now, don't forget the line about the banker and about the government people. The govern... Yeah, the government people, yes. You can't imagine how difficult it is to get a good chess game around here. You're absolutely right, Etienne. You know, it's not as common as checkers. Oh, I'm terribly sorry, I had no idea... No, no, Gaspard, please, please, come in. I want you to meet a dear new friend of mine, -Doctor Gump. -How do you do, sir? Christian, this is the Grand Duke Gaspard Isidro du Clouseau. The Grand Duke? Your majesty. -Absolutely a pleasure. -Thank you. Madame Girardin told me that all Grand Dukes are doddering old men. (LAUGHING) Not this one. Well, I give the Grand Duke whatever guidance I can. Between us, what I mostly do is keep the girls away from him. -Oh, no. -Oh, yes, you don't know. So many of the young girls today are just out to marry a title! Disgraceful. Well, we'll hold them off until the right one comes along, won't we, dear boy? I'll see you in the morning for my bank appointment. Oh, and at 10:00, we have the government people. Don't let me forget, now, Etienne. Good night, sir, it's been a great pleasure. Your majesty. My goodness, what a cake! What delicious calories. Let's not forget the waistline. -(MEN LAUGHING) -Good night, gentlemen. Ah, charming fellow. Etienne, this is a fantastic coincidence. Yes? I have a young niece who I, uh, watch after. She's sort of, uh, rudderless. -Really? -Really. And I'm giving a party for her tomorrow, in her honor. And I want you and your young friend the Grand Duke to come. Well, personally, I'd be delighted, but, uh, you know, the Grand Duke has so many calls on his time. Uh... I doubt really that, on such short notice, he... But you must bring him! You must beg him, please, implore him. All right, uh, I'll do whatever I can. Excellent! (CHUCKLING) I have something in mind. (CHUCKLING) Wouldn't it be something if my niece and your friend, the Grand Duke, should, uh, la-da-de-da-dah? (LAUGHING) Oh, Christian. You are a romanticist. A daydreamer. We shall see. We shall see. If that's not enough, let them drink soda pop. -Morning, everybody. -Oh, good morning, dear. Morning. Where were you last night? GUMP: Oh, I had dinner with a friend. Oh? Was she attractive? Now, Millicent, I don't want you speaking this way in front of your grandmother! -What's he talking about? -I don't know. -What are you making? -Oh! Little wool booties. Oh, aren't they cute! Who are they for? For you! You told me you were going to have a baby! Millicent, you're not going to disappoint me again. (CHUCKLING) Darling, of course I wouldn't disappoint you, but, uh, I meant when the right man comes along. A good man is hard to come by these days. GUMP: Well, I don't know about that, young lady. Just last night, I had dinner with a Grand Duke. Young, handsome, and available. As a matter of fact, he's coming to the party this afternoon. Party? What party? Oh, did I forget to tell you? Yes, you certainly did. Well, your grandmother and I are giving a party for you. (SIGHS) Well, thanks a lot for telling me. Well, you said yourself that marriage and babies might be fun for a change. So I've arranged for you to meet some nice young men. It's the best way, dear, if you want to become a mother, you know. Absolutely right! Every available young man on the Riviera will be here to meet you, including this Grand Duke I was talking about, his name is... Would you please stop pushing men at me? When I decide to get married, I'll choose the man. You're being selfish again. It's time you started thinking of other people's happiness and show some consideration! Would you please just leave me alone? That girl! MATHILDA: Oh, well. I suppose it was foolish of me to hope for another grandchild, anyway. No, it's not, Mathilda! The girl has no consideration. She's selfish and self-centered. MATHILDA: That's not true, Chris! Millie is just trying to find herself. She's a good girl. I won't have you talking that way about her. I love her. But wait a minute. She says, "Next time you come back, mon petit, "you bring Champagne." (CLEARS THROAT) Sorry to interrupt your social life for business, Davis. Oh, I was just telling a little story I heard about, uh... Yes, I bet you were. Would you get out my Maserati? I'd like to go to town. Fine. Where are we going? -School. -What? School! Fine. All right. -Oh, Davis. -Hmm? You forgot something. I thought we decided I wasn't gonna wear a hat. I never decided any such thing. Move over. I'm driving. (ENGINE REVVING) (TIRES SCREECHING) What do you think you're doing? All right. You want to kill yourself in this hot rod, you go right ahead, but you're not taking me along with you. -Now, move over! -I'm not moving! I said, move over. What? I would like to know who you think you are... Stop... Would you just, just calm down, will you? Now I'm going to drive you nice and safe and sane, like a good chauffeur. All right. You're fired! Yes, fine, all right. There now, wasn't that better? Don't you talk to me. Put this on. What's with you and this hat? I'm not gonna discuss it with you. Put it on, that's an order! No hat! If you don't put it on, you're fired! All right, I'm going to save you the trouble. I quit! Well, good riddance! (BELL RINGING) (SPEAKING FRENCH) Merci. (MEN SPEAKING FRENCH) -Au revoir, au revoir. -Bonsoir. (DISTANT SIREN BLARING) I thought you quit. Well, I needed the job. Where to? Ballet school. Ballet school? (ENGINE STARTING) You're right, that hat does look kind of silly on you. Ah, well. Thank you. (CHILDREN SINGING IN FRENCH) Say, what are we stopping here for? Oh, there's something I want to look at. -Come on! -All right. -You know what these are? -Hmm? No, what? And you call yourself a driver? These are the winners of the International Grand Prix. -Oh? -Look. Brabham, Fangio, Chiron, Sommer, all the great racing drivers of the world. And you know something else? What? Someday, I'm gonna be the first woman to win this race. My name's going to go on a plaque just like one of these. Oh, yes, your name is going to go on a plaque, all right. And do you know what it's going to say? It's going to say... "Here lies Millicent the nut, "who "skidded on a turn and broke her butt." Oh, you're so smart, aren't you? What would you know about racing? Too bad you're only a chauffeur, Johnny. Bonjour, bonjour. How are you? Hello there! Ooh! Excuse me! Look at the way she's dressed! Oh, bonjour! -Is she kidding? -With $40 million, what difference does it make? Darling! I wanted to ask you, did you find somebody for me yet? Well, but I thought you didn't want to rush into it. Oh, no, I changed my mind. I think we should find somebody. -Of course! -Tell you what. When you find the right person, I want you to give me a nod, all right? Yes, I will. Bye-bye. (MOUTHING) My name is Freddie, and I am a Count, which is very nice. Also, this meeting is fate. Watch the toes. Never have I married, knowing someday I would meet the right girl. -My name is Freddie. -Yes, so you said. Oh... Toes. (BOTH LAUGHING) There is so little time for love and happiness. Let us seize the moment, no? -Yes, yes. -Millicent? Will you marry me? Will you spend your life with me, my adorable creature? I am terribly sorry, gentlemen. She is somewhat, uh, unpredictable at times. This seems to be one of those times. -She's absolutely lovely, doctor. -Yes. Okay, everybody, get lost! We choose this one. (MILLIE SHRIEKING) Millicent, there's someone very important I want you to meet, so try to conduct yourself properly. Ugh. Millicent, I want you to meet my very dear and close friend. Monsieur Pimm, this is my niece, Millicent Mehaffey. How do you do? You are absolutely adorable. Well, thank you, so are you, monsieur. You have a lovely and gentle face, -and I like you! -Thank you, Miss Millicent. And now I want you to meet, uh, His Grace, the Grand Duke Gaspard du Clouseau. I am so very happy to meet you. Is that Guy Beausoleil, too? Miss Mehaffey. Just call me Millie. Ah, he's the best one so far. -Millicent... -He's a complete dream! Don't overdo it. You're absolutely adorable-ish. And I choose you! Oh, do you like racing cars? Isn't it odd that she should mention that, Etienne? Coincidence, dear boy. Racing cars is my hobby. That's mine, too! Oh. I'm driving a Mercedes in the International Grand Prix next week. I'm driving in that race! Oh, that's marvelous. Would you like to come with me, and I'll show you my Cooper? If that doesn't sound like a proposition, I don't know what does. They make a handsome couple, don't they? Well, I only hope the Grand Duke likes her. Oh! She's lovely. Of course, he meets lots of girls. Well, I only dare hope that he sees beneath the Champagne girl and sees her for what she really is. Of course he will. In fact, I'm sure of it. (LAUGHING) Ah, what a perfect meeting. It couldn't have gone better. Rich Millie met poor Gaspard and liked him instantly! (SIGHING) Now... The courtship begins. We must all work harder than ever. Now, Gaspard, remember, you must seize every opportunity to show her your love. Everywhere! Skillfully, tenderly... An embrace here, a kiss there, while driving your car, at the dinner, at the theater, while riding your horses, while swimming... Excuse me, uh... On a horse? Why, naturally, why not? What's so extraordinary about that? Would you get up, Janine, please? Now, turn your chair around and pretend you're riding. Sit down, now, the two of you, alone, on a bridle trail, in the midst of nature. Start your horses. What could be more romantic? The sun shining. Beautiful trees blooming. The birds are singing. And when you think the moment is right, lean across, take her hand, and very tenderly press it to your lips in a sweet summer kiss. Ah, what could be more romantic? Gaspard! Come down. (SNEEZING) Oh, you're a marvelous dancer! Thank you. (CYMBALS CRASHING) Oh! Gaspard! Gaspard! (ALL TALKING AT ONCE) -Hold still. -Why couldn't my father have been a beer salesman? A beer salesman? Yes, or a farmer or a cement mixer. -Why? -Well, then I wouldn't be a Grand Duke, and I wouldn't be in this ridiculous situation. I'm not good at this type of thing, Janine. Ooh. Poor you. Well, once you're married to her, things will be better. I never knew my mother. She died when I was just a little baby. But in the castle where I grew up, that was before my father lost all his money... There was a painting of my mother. She was such a beautiful woman. -Really? -Yes. But you're the first woman I can say is even prettier than my mother. That's a beautiful compliment. All my life I've had a vision of the woman I would someday meet and fall in love with. Oh, Janine. Gaspard... What's going on here? JANINE: Oh, I was just, uh... Come, come, Gaspard, we'll be late for the Mehaffey luncheon. Yes, sir. What do you think you're doing? Oh, don't fool around with our investment. I'm surprised at you, Janine. (GASPARD LAUGHING) I ran down Gaspard's family as you asked me, Chris. -Yes? -He's absolutely genuine. A bona fide Grand Duke. And I was sure he would be! (HUMMING) Hi. Hi. Aren't you gonna ask me in? Well, sure, come on in. Well, what happened? I thought the party was downstairs. Well, I got bored with it, so I thought I'd bring it up here. You like Champagne? Sure, why not? You know, I, uh, wasn't expecting company. -Davis? -Mmm-hmm? May I ask you a question? Yeah, what? How come you never pay any attention to me? Well... Do you think I'm attractive? Yeah, I guess so. What? Yes. Think I have a nice body? Well, I haven't looked. Well, look now. That's very nice. Uh, look, do you mind? I, uh... Well, then, why don't you close the door and seduce me like any other normal chauffeur? Oh, I never seduce my employers on Thursday. What's wrong with Thursday? Why, it's my day off. Thanks for the drink, boss. Are you going to meet a woman? Well, now, you know, there's one good thing about a man's day off. He doesn't have to answer any questions. Is she prettier than me? Well, uh... She's a heck of a lot more stable, that's for sure. Do you know her intimately? Well, let's just say we've spent a lot of nights at sea together. Any more questions? Oh, and have a good time at the party. I'll see you later. Hi, Johnny! How are ya? Hi. Hi. This is a nice boat. -Yeah. -Is it yours? Yeah, it's mine, it's, uh... Yeah, that's my boat. I, uh, see what you mean by her being more stable than me. (CHUCKLING) Right. -Oh! -Hmm? What happened there? Yeah, well, I had a little accident, uh... You mind if I keep working? Oh, no, no, don't mind me. Look, excuse me, again. Well, it certainly is a nice boat. Yeah, you... It's a real nice boat. Hmm. Right? -Yeah. -Right. Um, would it be all right if I kinda hung around for a while? Well, if, uh... If you do, you know, I'm gonna put you to work. You mean that? Yeah, why not? Oh, I'd like that! I... I'd like that very much. I'm very good at working on boats, you know. -You're kidding. -No, I'm serious! I have a boat, and I... I do a lot of things on it. I'm very good with my hands. Carpentry, anything you want. Oh, come on. Well, you can't, dressed like... -Oh... -Well, all right. There's, uh, there's some old clothes up in the cabin. -Suppose you change. -Up... Upstairs? Hmm. Yeah, upstairs. Oh, good! I... I'll be very good, too, you'll see. -Yeah, well... -Thank you. That's all right, don't mention it. Well, I'm ready. What do you want me to do? Well, you know how to use a paintbrush? As good as anybody. All right. Suppose you start on the hull. That's downstairs. -Oops! -Beg your pardon. (HORN BLARING) (HORN CONTINUES BLARING) (INDISTINCT TALK) (ALL LAUGHING AND SHOUTING) -(HORN STOPS) -ALL: Oh... Whoa, hold it, hold it. Come on, let me give you a hand here. -You all right? -Yeah. A little tired. And you must be hungry by now. Mmm-hmm. Suppose you wash up, I'll take you to dinner. Okay, thanks. I only hope I didn't ruin your boat by working on it this afternoon. No, as a matter of fact, if ever you need it, I'll... I tell you what I'll do, I'll write you a letter of recommendation to the Maritime Union. -How's that? -Thank you. Why not? My, that's nice music. Yeah. (SIGHS) It certainly would be nice to dance to it. -Hey, Johnny! -Hi, Pierre. -How's the boat coming? -Oh, fine, thanks. Bye, now. So, you're very lucky. DAVIS: How's that? You've got a lot of friends, and they... They all seem to take you on face value, that's very nice. I envy you. Oh, I don't think you've got anything to envy. Well, you know, it's not that easy being an heiress. Every time I like somebody, then my money gets in the way. Get rid of it. Well, now, that's a silly solution. I'm already spoiled, and... I like luxury, I'm used to it. Besides, I don't think I could adjust to being poor overnight like you. -You still want to dance? -Yeah. -Johnny? -Yeah, what? Would you ask the woman you marry to live on that funny, old boat of yours? Yes. And you know something? The woman I marry will like that boat of mine, see? Well, what about the kids? What about 'em? Well, I'd hate to have my kids grow up with... Without a backyard to play in. Look, my kids will make out just fine, thank you. I want my children to grow up with all the advantages money can buy. Fine, that's fine. But you know something, I want my children to grow up with a lot of advantages that money can't buy. Now, what's wrong with money? I buy a lot of nice things in life -with money. -Yes, I... I know you do. I just say they have to... They should earn their money. They shouldn't have things just handed to them on a silver platter, you know. You understand that, surely, huh? Well, I think that's selfish. I think you're... -It's not... -...depriving the children. I'm not depriving them of anything! They got to know the value of money. There's nothing wrong with that, now is there, tell me... MAN: Come on, Johnny, let the kids have money. -Pierre, you keep out of this... What? -There, you see, you see? You're selfish, and you're depriving them, -and even your friends... -I am not selfish! You know what the trouble is? You're just a little mixed-up, that's all. -That's all. Yes! -A little! I'm a lot mixed-up. Well, I guess it's that kind of a world, isn't it? I guess so. Good night. Good night. It's been a lovely day. One of the happiest times of my life. Hello, dear! Have a nice evening? Beautiful. Just beautiful. Any day now. -Hi. -JANINE: Oh, hello, Johnny. How is everything? Well... Have you had dinner? -JOHNNY: Yeah, I had dinner. -(CAR DOORS CLOSING) (CAR DRIVING AWAY) All this time, I thought she was fooling! Merely childish prattle about driving in the International Grand Prix tomorrow. No, she wasn't fooling. Right, and that's why I've called this meeting. This is our first major crisis. Do you realize the investment we all have in Gaspard and her? I won't let her jeopardize all our plans by going out on a racetrack and getting herself killed. We have to stop her. It's a little late for that, isn't it? Well, that's why we're all here, to come up with an idea. Come, come, start thinking! All right, the floor is open for suggestions. (CHUCKLING) What is it? I got it, listen. Now look, the day of the race, you know, just before the... Oh, man, she's not gonna like me at all. All right. Oh, good morning. Did you sleep well? Ow! What... What'd you do that for? Don't even speak to me! What, what, Millie? What's going on here? Don't let last night fool you. I kiss all my chauffeurs once. -It's a hobby! -I thought that you and me were gonna start to... You thought? You're not being paid to think. You're being paid to get that car down to Monte Carlo. -Now move it! -All right! -All right what? -All right, you nut. Ooh! (ENGINE REVVING) (RACE ANNOUNCER SPEAKING FRENCH) (ENGINES REVVING) GASPARD: Hello, Millie! MILLIE: Hello, Gaspard. Johnny! It's the big day, uh? Good luck, Millie. Good luck. (ENGINES REVVING) Hi. All right now, listen to me very carefully. You hang back at the start. -Yes. -You trail into the tunnel. -Yes. -Now, when you get to the big curve, you're gonna have engine trouble, and you're gonna fall out of the race. -Now, you got that? -Oh, Johnny. -I think I could... -Wait a minute, you do... You do what I tell you, you hear? You're a nice guy. I don't want to see you get yourself killed. Starter! (ENGINES REVVING) Start her! Switch on! Come on, would you? They're in position! (ENGINE SPUTTERING) Oh! Bloody! There's no engine! Davis! I'll kill him! I'll kill him! -Oh, you! -Look, I did it for your own good. -Don't you understand that? -That race meant everything to me, and you ruined it! Oh, do you want excitement? Is that what you want in life? -Get in the car. -I will not! -I said get in the car. -I won't, you make me, you... Oh, you won't? All right. Oh! You! You stay there! You stay right there! I'm not getting into any car... (ENGINE REVVING) (TIRES SCREECHING) (TIRES SCREECHING) Now, Millicent, you must turn around and listen. I am older than you are, and you'll find that all lovers have a falling-out period. Not like this, they don't. Ordinary girls don't go around making complete fools of themselves! Oh, I've been a complete gloop! (LAUGHING) You're a very attractive girl, Millicent. -No, I'm not. -Yes, you are! -No, I'm not! -Yes, you are, and listen! And you'll find that... That the course of love... The course of true love never runs smoothly. You don't understand. He has another girl. I don't believe it. He does! I saw him drive off with her last night after he brought me home. Another girl? But I swear to you, I haven't seen another girl! Then why would she say that? She said that she'd made a fool of herself because you have been seeing another girl. No, no, I've been seeing Millie every day. I take her sailing and dancing and riding and water skiing. We're so busy, I don't even have a moment to make love to her. Let alone seeing another girl. No, no. I'm beginning to see what Millie's talking about. -Hmm. -They need a more romantic setting. Yes, away from the crowds, where there are no distractions. Where love can blossom and reach its natural conclusion. Exactly what I had in mind, Etienne. Let me have a talk with Millie. I'm sure I can arrange it. Well, you see, Millie, I suppose we French consider the art of love somewhat differently than other people. I am going to speak quite openly about you and Gaspard. What are you getting at? You know, as I approach the autumn years of my life, I look back on the most satisfying of relationships in the vineyard of love. True, I've never married, but, uh, I have enjoyed quite a few, uh, affiliations with many memorable women. Yes, I bet you have. (CHUCKLING) Yes, yes, indeed. Well, the point I'm making is that, contrary to what most people think, the social whirl on the Riviera is not conducive to love. No, young people in love need the peace and quiet of a secluded, uh, shall we say, "haven." Well, Millie, some years back, I acquired a little island in Switzerland. Just a few hours from here on Lake Maggiore. I want you to use my little villa on Isole de Brissago. -What for? -As... What for? Well, perhaps, in the quiet and seclusion of this, uh, idyllic spot, you know, the... The young man might feel otherwise inclined. (SIGHING) The young man that I mean is not likely to feel so inclined. Do you mean to take him there with me? Oh, I... I couldn't do that. But, my dear, why not? Well, maybe I'm old-fashioned, but, I mean, if a man loves a woman for what she is, that's one thing, but to... To deliberately set out to trick him and to snare... Oh, no, no, no. Oh, how can you? No! I don't mean trick him, no. I merely suggest that men are only mortals. They respond to the stimuli of beauty and flowers in a gorgeous setting with normal, romantic responses. Now, if under those circumstances, the young lady is, uh... Well, that's just the way it is, isn't it? -Good morning, Johnny. -Good morning. -Where to, Miss? -Switzerland. -Switzerland? -Switzerland. Right. (YODELING SOFTLY) Willkommen! (BOTH WELCOMING IN GERMAN) (SPEAKING GERMAN) -So long. -Davis. My, isn't this unusual. Looks like something out of a Turkish harem. (BOTH SPEAKING GERMAN) Your room is at here. Now there's a lucky girl. Hey, whose place is this? A friend of mine loaned it to me. -Do you like it? -It's crazy. I'll see you at dinner. Yeah. Your bedroom is this way, sir. Yeah, oh. Well, here we are, sir. I hope you'll be very comfortable, sir. Hey, just a minute. -Sir? -I... I mean, where am I supposed to sleep? Dinner will be served in one hour, sir. Yes, but... (FLUTE MUSIC PLAYING) (CLOCK CHIMING) Oh, Christian, what an evening is about to unfold for our two young lovers. -Dinner is served, sir. -Oh, yes, of course. Well, my dear Etienne, we sure pulled this one off! And what do you think they're doing now? Well, I would say they're about to open the Champagne. -Yes. -The table is glowing with soft, romantic candlelight... -Good evening, gentlemen. -Good evening, Gaspard. -Oh, by the way... -Yes. -I want to talk to you about the wedding. You know, Christian, I insist on giving the reception -for our happy couple. -Oh, my dear Etienne, absolutely out of the question! -I insist on all expenses. -Very well. If you insist on paying everything. Hey! What are you doing here? Waiting for Millie. You mean she went off without you? But that couldn't be! Isn't she upstairs, dressing? Stacy, did Miss Millicent leave this morning? Oh, yes, sir. At 8:00 a.m., sir. And who'd she go with? She went alone, sir, Davis drove her. We must go quickly. We have to drive all night and hope it's not too late! What's wrong, it's just the chauffeur? But you don't understand, he's a man! And that place is booby-trapped. Booby-trapped? Dinner is served, sir. (SOFT JAZZ PLAYING) Good evening, Johnny. Good evening, Miss. Oh, please call me Millie. Won't you sit down? Yes, thank you very much. With your permission, sir. Yes, thank you. "What mad pursuit. "What struggle to escape. "What wild ecstasy!" John Keats. I hope you don't mind, Miss. It's a custom of the house, with each bottle of wine. Oh, that's lovely, Mueller, thank you. And now, I'll see to your dinner. Thank you. (CHUCKLING) Millie. Yeah, well... Hey, what's this thing here? Oh, I'll show you. Hey... How about that? Well, now. Hope you don't mind. It's a custom of the house. Some house. Slow down, Etienne! You'll get us all killed! Now, it's not that important that we get there on time. But you don't know that place! Good night, sir. Good night, miss. JOHNNY: Good night. Hmm. Johnny, why don't you put down your glass and come back and tell me about everything. All right, I will tell you something. It's about my room. And you know, it's something very, very pecu... Pec... Very peculiar. -What's wrong? -Oh, there's nothing wrong. Uh... Oh, I don't know, it's, but you, there... Well, do you know that there's no bed in my room? -Really? -Mmm. How about that? Now, where... Where do you suppose I'm supposed to sleep? Hmm? Why don't you... Why don't you turn the music down, and we'll discuss it? Yeah. (SOFT JAZZ STOPS) Good morning, Mueller. Good morning, Gretl. Good morning, Miss, I hope you slept well. Lovely, thank you. Oh, isn't this a beautiful morning? (SPEAKING GERMAN) I'll be right down. MILLIE: Good morning! -Gretl? -Ja? Uh, would you mind... Could I borrow your apron? -For what? -Well, I'd like to, uh... I'd like to serve Mr. Davis's breakfast this morning. Ah, I understand. You know, my whole life is going to change now. I'm going to make a good wife, and I'm going to take care of my man, and we're going to live on a boat. I'm going to give him his breakfast every morning. (HORN BLARING) -What is that? -It's the fresh milk, Miss. Gabriel brings it across in his boat every morning. Oh, I'll get it! You finish here, and I'll go and get it, all right? (BOAT ENGINE IDLING) Good morning. (SPEAKING ITALIAN) You the new maid here, eh? Yeah, that's right. -Is that our milk? -Yeah. That's your milk. Nice to have a new face around here. (CHUCKLING) Hands off, Romeo. I'm bespoke already, capisce? Too bad, say! I hear they have another couple here last night. How did it go, uh? None of your damn business. But what a business, eh? (SPEAKING ITALIAN) Mr. Pimm has got a good thing going, eh? What a way to make a living. Who is the rich lady stuck with one of his boys this time? I hear in town it's the chauffeur, uh? What do you mean by that? You a new maid. You don't... You don't know what Pimm uses this villa for? -No. -Hah! I'll tell you how Pimm makes his money. Yes, please do. (HORN BLARING) (SPEAKING ITALIAN) Good morning. Oh, my. Say, where's Miss Mehaffey? GRETL: Getting the morning milk. She say she come right back. Fine. -DAVIS: Good morning. -Good morning -I'll take that. -Well, okay... Bon appetit. Now what was that for? Hey, hey! Millie! -Where's... -You meddling old billy goat. How dare you! And you, my own uncle! (SHOUTING OVER EACH OTHER) Can you swim? Millicent! No, wait, please! Traitors! All of you! I hate you, I hate you, I hate you! Millicent, you naughty girl! You come back this moment! It was supposed to be Gaspard there. On the island with you. Davis was merely the... Gaspard! What has he got to do with this? He was the intended groom. All of us, Davis, Zoltan, and myself, we were all set to marry you off to Gaspard. However, it seems that you fell in love with the wrong man. Oh! All of you! All of you plotting against me! What do you think I am? A... A box lunch or a... A door prize that goes to the highest bidder? That, that... (KNOCKING ON DOOR) Yes, Stacy, what is it? Excuse me, Miss Millicent. Count Freddie is down on the terrace, waiting for you. Well, go tell him to jump in the ocean. Yes, Miss. You did have an appointment to go swimming with him. I don't care! I never want to see another man as long... Wait a minute. It would teach you all a lesson if nobody got my money! What are you talking about? I'll give them a marriage to gossip about! Millie, Millie, Millie! Don't do anything silly, please! Now, Millicent, please. -Don't do anything foolish. -Leave me alone! Oh, my precious American sweet thing. -Here we are, together finally. -Here we are... You are so adorable, I kiss you. Freddie, I want to talk to you. Yes. Ah, you forgot I was to take you swimming today? I'm not in the mood for swimming. Yes, anything your heart desires, my darling sweet thing. What would you like to do? I want to get married. Will you marry me? Certainly, marry you. Good. What? Marry you? Yes, of course, marry you! Yes, marry you! That's wonderful. You don't have any crazy notions about, uh, money, do you? I don't know, what do you mean? Well, I mean, you don't have anything against it, because... Because I'm loaded with it! But I love money, my darling! I love it, I love to count it, to touch it, to spend it. -I... I adore... -That's... That's wonderful. That's wonderful, because... Because I've got $40 million, and we're gonna spend it together. -See? -Ooh... And we're going to have the... The biggest, splashiest wedding you've ever seen! And our kids are gonna have all the money they want. And they're gonna drive fast cars! And... And we're gonna have the biggest and the fanciest and the hugest villa on this darn Riviera! -Ohh-hoo-hoo. -You like it, Freddie? Oh, it's wonderful, oh! I can't stand it. -You like it? -Oh, it's so beautiful! -You mean you bought this for us? -Yes, of course. -A little summer place. -Oh-ho, it is the way I've always seen myself living. A fantasy, wonderful. My adorable girl. I think it's disgusting. It's a vulgar display of wealth, and I think it's revolting. Well, as they say, you can't win them all. It was a good try, and we lost. Oh, no, no, no, my dear sir. I'm too good a businessman to fold up shop. We've got an investment in Gaspard, and we're going to make it pay off. I've got word of a nice, rich heiress from Brazil who is coming to the continent with her family next week. Now, we're going to move our operation to my place in Paris. Gaspard, you're go... Janine. Where are you going? I'll see you at the airport. (INDISTINCT CHATTER) Oh, Gaspard, what are you doing here? I am sorry to intrude, but I came to say goodbye. It isn't necessary, we'll all be on the plane together. No, I am not going to Paris with Mr. Pimm and all of you. What will you do? I don't know, but I've had enough of that, uh, other life. I will get a job. An honest job. One which will give me back my self-respect. May I have an address where I could write to you, please? Why? Because when my life is reconstructed, I would like to write you a letter. Things I cannot say now. It may be too late to say it then. In my letter, I would have said that I adore you with all my heart. With a love which would last to the end of our days. I would also say that I want you for my wife. Eh! (CHANTING IN FRENCH) Another two, maybe three hours, and we will have her finished and put her in the water, Johnny. Fine, can't be soon enough for me. I'm heading for deep water just as quick as -I can get out of here. -I'll do my best, Johnny. Fine. Thanks, Gallou. (GREETING IN FRENCH) Hello, Johnny. Whatever it is, the answer is no. Well, do me the courtesy of listening, at least. -Hmm. -I admit I was wrong about Millie and Gaspard. But now she's making a complete fool of herself! Fine, she's over 21, she can make her own mistakes. Well! Let me at least arrange a meeting between you. Won't you do that? Johnny, please. All right, fine. I'll let you arrange a meeting. Right here. Latitude about 36 degrees north, longitude four degrees east. How's about Tuesday at 9:30? Is that all right? You mean you're leaving her to that man? That is right, I'm leaving her. Just as quick as this hull hits the water. Psst! That's it. Well, you can get into your precious boat and sail halfway around the world if you like. But it won't ease your conscience any! You're running out on her, and she's in love with you. -Hmm. -Well, I'll tell you something else, Johnny. People with money can get hurt, just as well as you or I. Oh-ho, look at that! Oh, dear Mr. Pimm. -Congratulations. -My dear Janine. I wish you every happiness. Thank you. -Good luck, Gaspard. -We thank you so much, sir. GASPARD: Goodbye! -Goodbye. -GUMP: Goodbye. PIMM: Goodbye. (HORN HONKING) There goes the best secretary a man ever had. Well, don't look at it that way, Etienne. You haven't really lost a secretary, you've gained a friend. -Who's that? -Me. Oh! (LAUGHING) -My dear fellow. -Come, I'll buy you -a nice cool vermouth cassis... -Good. ...and we'll chat. (ALL SINGING IN FRENCH) Well, I'm not gonna go through this feeling sorry for myself, I'm just not! Granny, the first marriage is always the bad one, isn't it? Millie, if you don't think this is right, don't do it. Don't waste one precious minute of yourself on the wrong man. Well, it's a little late for that, isn't it? (SNIFFLING) Oh, Granny, why do I get myself into these terrible messes? You break my heart, dear. I beg your pardon, Miss. A package for you. They say it should be opened immediately. Who would send a thing like that? Dirty. Where did you get this? A gentleman brought it to the back door, Miss. Well, where is he? I don't know, Miss. He just went away. I chased your grandfather for six blocks through the snow and slush of Boston to get him. (LAUGHING) Well, don't stand here hugging me! Do you want him or don't you? (SNIFFLING) Yes, yes. (SIGHS)
