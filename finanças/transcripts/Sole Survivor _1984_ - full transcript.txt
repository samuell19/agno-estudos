(tense music) (Karla screaming) - She's coming. (objects rattling) (Karla gasping) (Karla whimpering) (phone ringing) - All right. Okay, hold on. Blake. It's Karla Davis. What the hell does she want? - I don't know. - What the hell do you want? - Blake? What's the name of that woman at the ad agency? The one I'm supposed to do the commercial for. - Denise Watson. Is that what you woke me up for? - Do you know if she's taking a flight out this morning? - [Blake] Oh, how the hell should I know that? - Something's going to happen. - Honest to God, Karla, don't start this crap again. - I'm not asking you to do anything, Blake. Just give me the number of someone at the agency that can get in touch with her. - Just give you the number so you can rouse them out of bed in the middle of the night and tell them that you think their producer is gonna be killed. - Not killed. - Fine, then everything's right. Go back to bed. - What the hell did she want? - Oh, same old story. She hasn't worked in six years. This commercial's her last chance to get her face in front of the public and she wants to start making her midnight calls. - [Blake's Wife] Great. (tense music) (airplane engine roaring) (radar beeping) - [Con 86] Metropolitan Departure Control, this is Con 86 holding at (indistinct). - [Departure Control] Con 86, climb and maintain 6000. - [Con 86] Thank you, Con 86, (indistinct) 1500 for 6000. - Con 86, contact Bishop Control at 6000. - [Con 86] Metropolitan, this is Con 86. We have a light on our panel that... - Con 86, say again? - [Con 86] Con 86, stand by, please. (radar beeping) (alarm beeping) (prolongued beeping) - Jesus. (helicopter whirring) (people talking indistinctly) - [Woman] Got it? - [Man] Okay. - Ronnie, you wanna take this for me, please? - [Ronnie] Sure. - Can you tell me your name? - [Man] Take that part. - Denise Watson. - Denise, can you tell me your middle name? - Lynn. - Easy. - Denise Lynn Watson. - Denise, were you traveling alone? - Yes. How many made it? - Just you, I'm afraid. - Oh. - You're one lucky lady. - No. I saw them move. I lived with my grandmother after that mostly - [Doctor] Mm-hmm. - My grandmother and five or six trust funds. But money can't buy happiness. - Can't buy poverty either. - What about you? - Me? - Yeah, you've learned all about me, right? - My father was a plumber. My mother is a mother. And I had asthma. - And? - And I outgrew it mostly. Watch the pencil. Don't move your head, just your eyes. - The nurses say you're single. - The nurses talk too much. Okay. As far as I'm concerned, you're paroled. I'd like you to continue to see Dr. Webber for that stiffness in your shoulder. Sometimes it takes a couple of months for it to work itself out. Oh, by the way, there are reporters downstairs. - How many? - Couple from the papers and a crew from channel seven. - See, I told you so. There's been nothing else in the news for eight days. - Well, it was a pretty big thing. People are interested. How do you feel, Denise? - Great. I'm the miracle girl, didn't you see me in the news? - Denise. - Didi, okay? - Didi. How do you feel? - Odd. - Depressed? I have reasons for asking. - I feel odd. I don't know. Depressed. Oh, but I've been bounced with depression before. I don't know. - Denise, Didi. There's a psychological condition called survivor's syndrome. Now, a person in your position can often feel guilty about having survived a catastrophe that killed everybody else. A person in your position may even feel unworthy of survival. - Nice try, but that's not it. I feel neither guilty nor unworthy. - Well then, you tell me. - It's like once I bought this dress at I. Magnin's. Expensive, so I charged it. And it never showed up on my bill. So I thought great, a mistake in my favor, I'll just keep my mouth shut. It's kind of the same thing I felt when I came to after the crash. But that's only good as far as it goes, like I'm a cause and effect person. Now I knew why I never got the bill for my Magnin, it was because the computer screwed up. But as far as me being alive... (people chattering) - Excuse me. - Yes. - I've been trying to get someone to help me for the last five minutes. - Look, this is a hospital, we can't stop everything we're doing every time somebody needs help. - I realize that for sure, but my name's Kristy Cutler, I'm Denise Watson's neighbor. - And? - I'm supposed... I was supposed to pick her up around in back so she could avoid the reporters. - So? - Well, I've been waiting, she hasn't come out. I was wondering if you knew- If she said she'd be there, I'm sure she'll be there. I don't know anything about it. What? - Okay. Just point me in the right direction. - Go down here and take the elevator down, follow the hollow way out and it'll let you off at the loading dock. - Until next time. - [Woman On Intercom] Betty Campbell, 3257. Betty Campbell, 3257. - Didi. Do me a favor. Will you keep it in mind that what happened was just luck, pure and simple? I mean, don't make anything more out of it. It's just like that dress you never got billed for. - Oh, I got billed for it, all right. Those stupid computers. They may make a mistake, but they eventually find you. - [Woman On Intercom] (indistinct) 3115, (indistinct) 3115. (ominous music) - Oh, excuse me... Oh! Oh, excuse me. - What are you doing down here, honey? - I'm a patient. I mean, I was a patient. It was sort of arranged that I could leave through a back door. - The door is right around that corner. Make sure you close it behind you. Sending people down here. What do they think this is, the fun zone? (mysterious music) - Have you seen anything of a girl in a car? Like in the last few minutes? Are you all right? Are you supposed to be in the hospital? Are you sick? If you want, I can take you inside. (suspenseful music) (Denise screams) (truck bangs) Hey, what are you trying to do?! (Denise gasps) - Where you been? I've been waiting all over for you. - Did you just see that? This truck almost crushed me. - Yeah? You ought to be more careful. The brakes go out on these things all the time. - [Denise] I should have told somebody about that girl. - [Kristy] Forget her. (solemn music) How'd things turn out with that doctor? - [Denise] Oh, well I struck out. - Yeah? - Yeah, real bad. - [Kristy] I thought he was coming on to you. - [Denise] Yeah, that's what I thought. He took a real interest in me. You know, kept stopping by for little chats, asking me how I felt. - [Kristy] Sounds dull. - [Denise] No, it was nice. Damn, he was really friendly. Open, easy to talk to. Pleasant. Gentle. (Kristy laughs) - [Kristy] Yeah, we had a German sheperd like that once. Listen, I'm going to a party tonight. There'll be guys there. - Yeah, you forget, I've seen some of the guys you hang out with. Boy, I hope I never get that hard up. - They're all gray in the dark. (birds chirping) Look, if you need anything, I'm right across the street. - [Denise] Okay, thanks. Maybe I'll drop by later. - [Kristy] Except I won't be home later. The party, remember? - [Denise] Right, gray in the dark. (phone ringing) Hello, this is Denise Watson. I'm unable to come to the phone right now, but if you leave your name and number, I'll get back to you as soon as I can. Thanks for calling. (machine beeps) - [Brian] This is Brian Richardson. I was just calling to check to see how you- - Hi, what a surprise. - I didn't think you were home. - [Denise] Well, I just turned on the machine because I wanted to get a little work done. - Oh, well, I won't keep you. - Oh, no, no. That's all right. This isn't a professional call. Is it? I mean, this isn't part of the outpatient service. - No, no. I just got home and I thought I'd give you a call to see how you were feeling. - Hang on just a second, okay? Well, well, well. Hi, I'm back. This was really very sweet of you. - Well, to tell you the truth, I sort of got used to stopping in and seeing you. And I was also thinking about what you said this afternoon. - What was that? - About your cure for the blues. Work is okay, but I don't think you should overdo it. - Oh, well, you may be right. I've got this coffee spot to do on Tuesday. Other than that, there's not much going on. - A what? - A coffee commercial. You may have heard of it. Roaster's Blend? (Brian gasping) - What was that? Yes or no? - Ooh. Sorry. Nope. - [Denise] You sure? Nine out of 10 doctors prefer Roaster's Blend. - Well, I don't. - Ah, so you're the 10th doctor. I was wondering who you were. (Denise laughing) And it's with Karla Davis. She did all those beach movies in the sixties. "Surf's Up" and all that stuff. (fire crackling) (clock ticking) (phone beeping) What was that? - Oh, I have another call. I gotta hang up. - Listen, don't be so judgmental about what I do. If you want, drop by sometime. - I'll do it. Tuesday maybe. - Yeah. Tuesday maybe, about 2:30, three? Sure. Bye. (knocking on door) (mysterious music) - [Kristy] Where you been? I've been waiting all over for. (ominous music) You ought to be more careful. (phone ringing) - Yes. Hello? Yes it is. Who is this? - This is Karla Davis. I'm sorry. They gave me your number, the agency. - [Denise] Oh, Miss Davis, of course. Is there a problem with the shoot on Tuesday? - Oh, oh no. I was just calling because... I was wondering how you were. - I'm fine. - I just wanted to tell you... Keep your doors locked. (clock ticking) (Denise gasps) - [Kristy] Didi? - [Denise] Kristy? - [Kristy] Oh, man, I hope we didn't scare you. Wait a second. - [Denise] What were you doing out there? - We knocked on the front door, but nobody answered, so we came around back. Roxy almost fell in your swimming pool. - Yeah, like what the hell is a pool doing out there anyway? - It used to be in the living room. Roxy? - Yeah, this is Roxy. We were at this party and Roxy was blown away when I told you you were my neighbor. - You both look pretty blown away. - Like, I was wondering if you were heavy into God, do you like pray a lot or meditate or something? - Roxy's really into that stuff. - Because I was wondering, why you, man, out of all those people? - Yeah, if you think about it, it is kind of weird. - [Announcer] From her Malibu beach home, actress Karla Davis talks about coffee. - Let's have another cup of coffee and read through the script again. - Oh, I need to work on the part, but the coffee'll keep me awake tonight. - Oh, nonsense. It's Roaster's Blend. As an actress, I learned the value of a good night's sleep. That's why I drink Roaster's Blend. It's decaffeinated. - Mm! - You know, nine out of 10 doctors prefer Roaster's Blend. - [Woman] Fine, stop tape. - [Woman] That's not the line, Miss Davis. - [Man] That was take 68, 69 is up. - [Woman] B, please. - [Man] She must have made the same mistake in over 20 cuts. - [Man] We're gonna suck eggs on this one, Blake. - She hasn't been feeling well lately. Maybe she's got the flu. - And I'm getting an ulcer. - [Man] We're not getting our money's worth out of this, Blake. - She'll be on top of it tomorrow. I guarantee you. - Did anybody notice the way she acted around me? - [Man] You in particular? - Yeah, she got so nervous at one point she could hardly hold a coffee cup. - Well, look, you're in charge and she's screwing up. - No, that's not it. She phoned me last week. - [Man] What did she want? - I don't know. I didn't understand it. She said she was sorry for calling me and just hung up. - Well, something biting her, that's for damn sure. - [Karla] Nine out of 10 doctors- - [Man] Cut. - [Woman] That's not the line, Miss Davis. - Can we drop some of the key lights on Karla? Maybe kill some of the shadows under her eyes? If she doesn't look any better tomorrow, we're not gonna be able to use the spot. - Miss Watson. - Yeah? - Can I call you Denise? - Didi. - I'd like to apologize for Karla bothering you the way she did. - Oh, there's no need to apologize. I just wish I knew what was bothering her. - Well, to tell you the truth, I think she was drinking, and when she drinks, she makes phone calls. - [Denise] I see. - Look, I've spoken to her about it. And, well, I think tomorrow things are gonna go a whole lot better. - [Denise] I hope so. - Can we keep this just between the two of us? - [Denise] Hey, no problem. - Excuse me. - My fault. - It's funny you should show up right now, because I was just getting an uncontrollable urge to scream. Is there a doctor in the house? - I saw her once in one of those beach movies. I thought she was pretty foxy at the time. "Riders of the Wild Surf" was the name of it. I was in the seventh grade. - "Rider of the Wild Surf?" - Yeah. I thought Karla Davis tried to kill herself a few years ago. - You were in the seventh grade when you saw that? - Yeah. In fact, this is gonna sound awful, but I thought she was dead. - Just out of work. Same old, same old, in certain respects. I was in the eighth grade when that came out. - "Riders of the Lost Surf?" - Wild Surf. When's your birthday? - April 6th. - I'm nine months older than you. - So? - Nothing, I guess. - How are you feeling? Okay? - Well, I've been having a little trouble sleeping. Is there something I could take? - A nap. - Oh, I see. A joking doctor. - Well, I'm a little old fashioned about these things. I think if you want to sleep, you should try relaxing and going to sleep, not automatically pop a pill. - Come on. I don't get hung up on pills. - Famous last words. - You know, it seems to me you're taking a lot of interest in me. I mean, didn't you say that the reason you liked emergency medicine is because you could patch people up and send 'em on their way? Not get involved or anything. Come here. (gentle music) Last year I took three classes in assertion training. This is the first time it's really paid off. Mm. (people chattering) Oh, Jesus. It's even better when you help. - Lauren Bacall, "To Have and Have Not." - I can't help it. My mind's gone blank. I can't think of anything original. - I didn't even clean up my apartment. It's really a mess. - Mine's neat as a pin. Wanna see it? - This is very unprofessional. - It's out in Forrester Hills. Open countryside all around. - I have to be on duty at one in the morning. - We better hurry. It's an hour drive any way you slice it. - Where's your car? - It's over there. - My car's over there. I'll meet you at your car in five minutes and follow you out, okay? - Right. (people chattering) (gentle music) - [Man Whispering] Denise. (ominous music) - You asleep? - No. I was just thinking about that old man in the park. I don't know why a crazy old drunk should get on my nerves like this. There was just something so riveting about him. - Well, maybe if you stop talking about him, you'll forget him. - Kind of messed up the night, huh? - It was great. What are you talking about? - Really? - You bet. And I ought to know, 'cause I studied all this stuff. It was just like in the books. Accelerated heartbeat. Involuntary muscular reaction. Increased respiration. - Oh, Doctor, what a relief. - Why? - Oh, I'd hate to think that what I thought was passion turned out to be an asthma attack. - Oh, god. (Denise laughing) No, please, I give, I give, I give, uncle. - Mm. - I'm about to blow this whole thing. - Hmm? What? - I wanna know about this person you're involved with. - I'm not involved with a person. - You said you were. - You asked me if I was involved. Show me a resident that isn't, and up to his armpits at that. - Ah, work, that doesn't count. - Mm-mm. Oh god, you want to bet? Jesus. - God, where's the fire? Can't you call in sick or something? Doctors get sick. - No, no. Would you call in sick for your coffee commercial? - I would if I thought I could get away with it. Thank you. The only thing that keeps me going is knowing that it'll all be over with one way or another this time tomorrow. - Well, do you want to get together for dinner or something tomorrow? Maybe you'll be able to relax with your mind off it. - [Denise] Sounds great. Where? - Well, I came to your place today. Why don't you come to mine tomorrow? - The hospital? You mean you're going in now and you're gonna be there until tomorrow afternoon? - Yep, split shift. There's been a little shake up. Some people have been suspended. - Oh, for what? - We had a body disappear from the morgue the other day. - [Denise] God, I thought things like that only happened in the movies. - Yeah. Well, it's somebody's idea of a joke. They took the body out for half an hour and then put it back. - Some joke. - [Brian] Girl's parents found out about it and became understandably upset. - Girl? - Yeah. Little girl. She drowned in a boating accident. God, that must be so hard. Especially now around the holidays and everything, you know? (solemn music) The body disappeared right after she was brought in. Somebody told the parents and now the hospital is putting on a show about getting to the bottom of it. But the fact is nobody knows where the body went or how it got back. - [Denise] Coincidence. (birds chirping) (water running) (hairdryer whirring) (Denise sighs) - Shit, nerves. (birds chirping) - [Reporter] And now a look at our weather forecast. A low pressure system is moving into the area, and will be bringing showers with it. Skies should be turning cloudy by midday, with rain expected this afternoon. Showers will continue through this evening and should taper off by tomorrow morning. The storm is expected to be heavy at times, and travel advisories are in effect for outlying areas. The long range for... And there should be good news... (radio changing stations) (tires squealing) (Denise groans) - You idiot! What the hell are you trying to do? Are you trying to kill yourself or me or what? Hey! (ominous music) Just watch it. (tires squealing) - As an actress, I learned the value of a good night's sleep. - Oh, no. Where is she looking? - I'm sorry, she's looking at me. - Well, tell her to stop it. She looks shifty. - Take 106. Marker. (tape beeps) - As an actress, I learned the value- - [Woman] Lift up the coffee cup, Miss Davis. - Start again. - Take 107. Marker. (tape beeps) - As an actress, I learned the val- - [Woman] Oh, she did it again. - [Man] Keep your eyes on Dana, please. - I'm sorry. I better come in there. She's just bugged by me. - Come on, Didi. She's supposed to professional enough to keep her mind on the job at hand. - [Man] Thank you, thank you, makeup out, please. - [Man] Again. - [Man] Boy, we're hot now. Mark. (tape beeps) - [Man] Again. - [Man] Maybe she's waiting till the surf comes up. (people laughing) - [Man] What, hey! - [Man] Cut tape. - Karla. - What the hell? - Hold it. This seems to be between her and me. Maybe I can thrash it out. (baby fussing) (man whistling) Oh, excuse me. (window sliding) (horns honking) - We really shouldn't be up here during the remodeling. The elevator hasn't been working right. Two people got stuck up here last month. Look, if this commercial tests well, you could be doing a whole series of these things. But you cross those guys downstairs and you've had it. I mean, you don't know what they're like. They'll put out the word on you. - The word's out. I drink. And I'm crazy. When I was 18, all this stuff started. Do you know Ed Pallack? - No. - I was in this film he was producing. Mr. Pallack's wife was going to have a baby, only I knew about it even before he told everyone. I started having nightmares. Something was wrong with the baby. It was born, a girl, I think. It didn't live long. After that, I tried to warn people, people I dreamed about. But when you try to tell people about your nightmares, they think you're drunk, or crazy. I drink. But I'm not crazy. - Excuse me for saying so, Karla, but half the people in this business think they're psychic. - Did Blake tell you I tried to stop you from taking that plane? - No he didn't. But so what? I didn't die. - I never saw you die. I saw you not die. - What are you talking about? - No one can stop it, Denise. And anyone who gets in the way or anyone who knows about it or anyone who even suspects will be dealt with. - God, Karla, you're not making any sense. - I'm sorry. - Jeez. - [Man] Come on, girls. Got three more days of rehearsal. Come on! - Karla? (elevator dings) - [Man] Come on, girls, come on! (elevator screeches and whirs) - Hmm. I think we can make this work. I think we can take what we've learned from this and start all over again. Aw, come on. (elevator whirring) (elevator dings) (mysterious music) - [Man Whispering] Denise. - Hello? (Denise gasps) I don't have any money, really. If you're gonna try anything, I'm expecting friends down here. As a matter of fact, they should be here right now. So just be cool, okay? (suspenseful music) (Denise gasping) (elevator screeches and whirs) (elevator dinging) - [Man] Didi, where have you been? Karla's walked. - [Man] This places that whole account in jeopardy. - [Man] I mean, this is gonna reverberate in the front office like a Chinese gong. How much do you think we've lost in these last couple of days? - [Woman] We're down 10K right now. - [Brian] What did the police have to say? - Oh, they were great. They spent most of the time giving me the third degree. Didn't I know that every junkie in the world was looking for a place to get in out of the rain? By the time they finished, I felt like it was my fault. This is gonna sound weird... But it isn't the creep in the garage or the police... Or the accident this morning. It's something... (thunder rumbling) I don't know, it's something in the air. I feel like I'm about to be caught. - Caught? - That's the feeling. That's what I couldn't put my finger on in the hospital. That awful sort of feeling, like when you were a kid and you'd swipe something from the store and you knew your mom had found out and you're just waiting for the ax to fall. - Do you remember what I told you about survivor syndrome? Well, there's a little more to it. Okay? A large percentage of the people who are sole survivors of catastrophic accidents, like the one you went through, die themselves within 24 months. - Die? Of what? - Suicide. I don't mean they blow their brains out or anything, but some do. They just get careless. Step out in the street without looking. Drive a little too fast. Maybe go places where they subconsciously know they're in danger. - Now you're beginning to sound like the cops. - I'm just telling you. - And I'm telling you. I didn't go down in the garage, the elevator has been on the Fritz. It took me down there. And I didn't run myself off the road. This guy walked out in front of me. - All right. (thunder rumbling) - I don't need a shrink so much as a bodyguard. (ominous music) - Not having enough brains to come in outta the rain. Sure are a lot of weird people in the city. - How many people do you suppose to die in this city every day? - Lots, why? - [Denise] I was just thinking of something Karla said. - [Brian] What? - Nothing. She's crazy. (rain pattering) (thunder crashing) (solemn music) (Denise coughing) (ominous music) (upbeat music) - Full house. Queens and tens. - You ought to marry these cards. - How can somebody who stoned most of the time play cards so good? - Cosmic awareness. Come on, ante up. - Cosmic awareness. - Yeah, she saw God last week. - How did he look? - Not so good. Like he wasn't eating right. (clears throat) - Come on, Jennifer. We can't expect Randy to go through with it if we're not willing to, right? - All right. But I hope it's worth it. - It is. - I wasn't talking about me, jerk. (thunder rumbling) - What are we trying to do, Randy? Guess or wait? (all laughing) (rain pattering) - Okay, now we're down to it. Come on, Randy, ante up. - It's only skin, Randy. Everybody has it. (women laughing) (doorbell rings) Who's that? - Nobody. Don't move, Randy. The game isn't over yet. Oh, Didi, hi. - I thought I'd just dropped by. - Well, I was gonna go to this party later on. - Well, the thing of it is I needed a little company tonight. Things have gone bananas at work. - Well... Sure, okay, just a second. You guys gotta split. Go out the side. It's my neighbor. - Who, that airplane chick? Yeah. - The karma's so it's thick around her you could cut it with a butter knife. - Wait, guys, I can't find my shoe. (rain pattering) (thunder rumbling) - What's going on? Did I catch you in the middle of a shower or something? - This is Randy Pendergrast. - Randy? The paper boy? - Actually, he gave up that route three years ago. Time marches on? - I'm hip. Do you think your parents would mind if I swiped a drink? I'm suddenly feeling very old. - I can't find my other shoe. - Forget your other shoe. - Well, what about my coat? - Forget your coat! (rain pattering) (gentle music) (clock ticking) If you ask me, you're better off without Karla Davis. Whoever heard of her, anyway? She's in some old movies they show on channel 13 every once in a while. Nobody ever watches them, they're so stupid. They were made before I was born, even. - Lots of things happened before you were born. - Like what? - I don't know. World War II. Lots of shit. - You know, I've been thinking. You may have something like senioritis. I had it all last year at school. - Yeah, maybe. - I don't mean senioritis exactly, but something like it. I know I felt like I didn't fit in all last year at school. Not with cheerleading, with anything. I got in all kinds of fights with my teachers, my parents, I ditched school about four days a week. Are you ditching work? (thunder rumbling) Didi? Are you asleep? Yes? * Dashing through the snow * In a one horse open sleigh * O'er the fields we go * Laughing all the way Didi. Out with friends. (rain pattering) (thunder rumbling) (gentle music) (clock ticking) (rain pattering) (thunder rumbling) (glass breaking) (tense music) (glass banging) Hmm. Slow. (rain pattering) (dramatic music) (Kristy gasps) (clock ticking) - Kristy? (rain pattering) (suspenseful music) (Kristy gasping) Kristy? Kristy, are you upstairs? (suspenseful music) (water bubbling) (Kristy screams) (suspenseful music) (clock ticking) (dramatic music) (rain pattering) (ominous music) (clock ticking) (mysterious music) (rain pattering) - [Man On Phone] Hold on, hold on, take it easy. Is he in the house now? - Yes, yes. - [Man On Phone] Are you in the house? - No, I'm across the street. Please. - Okay. Stay away from your house. We'll have a unit there in a few minutes. - Okay please hurry. (tense music) (clock ticking) (Denise gasps) - [Man Whispering] Denise. (mysterious music) (Denise gasps) (rain pattering) (dramatic music) (Denise screaming) - Drop it, lady. - Like I told you, we searched Ms. Watson's house. Didn't find a thing. - Well, what about the girl? She still missing? - She left a note saying she'd be with friends. - [Brian] Overnight? - Cutler girl apparently has a history of this sort of thing. Neighbors say she is in the habit of staying away from home, more so now that her folks are out of town. - Okay. Forget about the girl for a second. Denise says you know who the man is who broke into the house. - Yeah. She saw it. Identified him as the guy. - [Brian] Is he? - No. He's a state highway inspector. Been missing for a couple of days. Process of searching through the woods for Ms. Watson's intruder, we found him in his car. Had a heart attack while driving. Lost control of the car, went over an embankment, piled into a tree. We found him deader'n a doornail. - Excuse me, we still on? - Yeah, yeah, give me five. - Okay. - [Officer] Been that way a couple of days, I guess. Look, I haven't known Denise all that long, but I don't think she would- - Well, you know her well enough to know about this? It's amitriptyline. It's an antidepressant. - Yeah, I know what it is. - Well, seems she's been rather casual about following the dosage. Last night, by her own admission, she was drinking on top of it. Now, you know as well as I do, Dr. Richardson, that could fuck over King Kong. And we got a lady here who claims to have been attacked by a dead man. Time of the attack, she was loaded. You see where we're coming from on this. - You know, I just had an idea about this survivor syndrome. Maybe you're supposed to die and there's a screw-up and you don't, so they have to set things right. That's why so many sole survivors die, they get them. - They who? - Don't play those games with me. I'm not serious. I'm just saying it's an interesting thought. - One at least worthy of your friend Miss Davis. - Well, I'll tell you this much, either the cops are wrong about that guy being dead or there's some real spooky shit going on. - Well, let's consider some more reasonable explanations, okay? What about the amytriptyline? - Oh. I see Lieutenant Patterson has given you his theory of the case. - [Denise] How come you never told me you were doing an old prescription? - I did. - You never told me it was amytriptyline. Do you know how dangerous that stuff is? - It's a legal prescription. - And the doctor that wrote it must have told you that taking it and drinking can kill you real fast. - So we're back to that again. Look. I wasn't thinking. I only took two and one drink. Will you get this through your head? I do not want to die. I haven't caused any of this. Well, what do you want me to say? What do you want me to say? Am I supposed to wanna die? Is that it? What, what? - Okay. - Are you sure this highway inspector is the guy? - Positive. He's the same guy that I almost ran over yesterday. - Okay. The cops have been wrong before. Look, I know a couple of guys who work over at County where they took the body. I'll stop off there this afternoon when I get off work and check it out, all right? (Denise sighs) - Oh. I hope you don't mind, I gave your number to my service. Told them I'd be here for a while. I kinda don't wanna be alone. - Sure. - Thanks. Really. - Look at this. Here you got a kid that gets so bum-tripped over flunking algebra that he wolves down 20 caps of Mommy's Percadin in and checks out. Dumb as shit. Somebody should have told him that five years from now, nobody'd give a rat's ass whether or not he even went to high school. - Yeah. Artie, look, I really came by to find out about that guy they just brought in. - Oh, the dude from streets and public works. - No, highways. - Well, same thing. All civil service bullshit. Hey, look, do yourself a favor and stay at Memorial. The worst mistake on my life is coming over here to County and getting mixed up with civil service. - Okay, about this guy. - Oh, a highway inspector. Can you imagine this guy has a massive coronary, drives off the highway and bites the big weenie? Cars going back and forth and nobody sees him. - Okay, now that's what I was wondering about. Can you let me see a workup on him? - What for? - Well, I think maybe the cops made a few mistakes. - You bet they did. I told 'em the report was wrong. (clears throat) But you know the cops, civil service. (phone ringing) - Hello? Yes, Karla. - I've been thinking about yesterday. Blake, my agent, says it wasn't such a hot thing for me to walk out. As a matter of fact, he dropped me. - I'm sorry. - Listen. About what I said. I get a little carried away sometimes. Everybody knows that. But I feel I could do the job. And I was wondering if we could work something out. - I'm really sorry about this, but there's nothing I can do about it. I tried to warn you. - Well, I just thought... - I'm really sorry this didn't work out. - That's all right. Denise. Did someone break into your house last night? (ominous music) - Yeah. That's why I didn't go into work today. - Goodbye, Denise. (tense music) - I get the feeling you know something about this. What? - Well, look, this guy may have been involved in breaking into a house. Okay? Now maybe the cops chased him and he ran back to his car and then had a heart attack. - Maybe. When was all this supposed to have happened? - Last night. - What? Not a chance. The guy was in the car for at least 48 hours. I was here when they brought him in. He was pretty ripe, if you know what I mean, clothes all wet, covered with mud. - Wait a minute. He was dead in his car for two days, why would he be wet? It only started to rain last night. I mean, if he was in there all the time. - Who knows? Maybe the cops dropped him or something and didn't report it. They botched the report anyway. - How? - They said they found the guy lying face down in the front seat of the car. - So? - So if the guy died lying face down, all the blood in his body would've settled along here. - Didn't it? - No. Every drop of blood in that guy's bod drained into his legs. No way did he lie around for any two days on his face, he died standing up. - Artie, don't be stupid. How could the guy die standing up? He was in a car. - That's what the cop said. All I know is the blood was in his legs. How it got there is not my department. Look, we had the same fight over some old geezer they found in the park. The report says "kidney failure, found lying in a prone position." Kidney failure, yes, prone position, no. All the blood was in his legs. I point that fact out to this asshole captain in Metro. "How'd the blood get in his legs?" he says. "Not my department," I says. For all I know he was up and walking around after he died. - All right, thanks. - This captain's got no sense of humor. (water running) (gentle music) - Karla. Karla. It's a part you're going to play. A part. (tense music) It's me. I got the part. I got the part. (phone ringing) - [Woman On Phone] Doctor Richardson's residence. - This is Richardson, I'm trying to reach someone in my house. Would you let the phone ring, please? - [Woman On Phone] Oh, Doctor. I have a message from a Didi. "Took a cab home to get my car and some clothes. Back in time for dinner. Maybe I do need a shrink," it looks like. - When did you get the message? - [Woman On Phone] About 20 minutes ago. Do you still want me to let the phone ring? - No. (bell ringing) - [Man On Radio] Okay, here we are on line number six. Let me press the magic button there. Hello, are you there? - [Barbara] Yeah, hi. - [Man On Radio] Hi. What's your name? First name only. What's your name? - Barbara. - Barbara. (birds chirping) Okay, you know the topic of the day. So go ahead and tell me, darling, what do you do to turn your man on? - [Barbara] I use sexercises. - [Man On Radio] What is that, within the boundaries of your text? - [Barbara] Sexercises? It's just like regular exercises except I take off my clothes while I'm doing them. - [Driver] I love it. - [Man On Radio] Kind of exercises you do? - [Barbara] Oh, jumping jacks, knee bends. - Excuse me, ma'am, what do you do to turn your man on? Anything in particular you might wanna share with me? I'm open right now for any kind of enlightenment. (driver chuckles) (birds chirping) Ma'am, that'll be $42.80. Listen, if you don't have the dough, I'm sure we could work something out. Is your old man at home? - You must be putting me on. - Can't blame a guy for trying, right? See you in church. (ominous music) - Kristy? - [Woman On Radio] He rubs baby oil all over my body and I rub baby oil all over his body. - Mm! - [Man On Radio] That sounds... - I heard about things like that, but I've never done 'em. - [Man On Radio] Suddenly I've become very worried. - Hello, sweetheart. - [Man On Radio] Never used to bother me before. The same effect with oil shale, would it? - Hey! - [Woman On Radio] No, I don't think- - Honey! You want a ride? It's gonna rain. I just dropped off some broad. I gotta drive all the way back into the city anyways. (ominous music) I could use some company, you know what I mean? So what do you say? You gonna go for it or not? - I was just over there. The back door's open and there's stuff dumped all over the kitchen floor. Somebody's been in her house. - [Man On Phone] Is this the woman who reported a prowler- - Yes, Denise Watson, 30641 Harvard. - [Man On Phone] Okay. Well, we'll have a unit there in about an hour. - An hour? Don't rush, okay? - [Man On Phone] Well, we have had a few cutbacks. - Oh, all right. (mysterious music) - [Man On Radio] Name of the program is Feminine Phone-In. - [Man On Radio] Well, I'm phoning in and I'm rather feminine. - [Man On Radio] I know, and you do sound like it, Linda, but after all, I mean, we do have... (solemn music drowning out radio chatter) (mysterious music) - [Man On Radio] Bye. (gentle music) - [Man On Radio] Line number there eight, haven't been up there in a while. Hello, hello. - God. - [Mary] Hello. - [Man On Radio] Hello. Boy, do you sound (indistinct). What's your name? - [Mary] I'm Mary. - [Man On Radio] Mary. Oh boy, Mary, I can tell that you're just ready. What do you do to turn your man on? - [Mary] I dress like his mother. - [Man On Radio] What?! Give me a break, you dress up like the guy's mother? - [Mary] Well, not his real mother. His stepmother, we're not sick. - [Man On Radio] Oh yeah, okay. - Bye. - Bye. (engine rumbling) (tires screech) - [Man On Radio] Hello, are you there? - [Woman On Radio] I'm here. - [Man On Radio] Hi, what's your name? Just your first name. (record scratching) (tense music) (ominous music) - Didi! (Brian panting) Come on, let's get... (suspenseful music) - No! God, Kristy. - [Man Whispering] Denise. - You're not Kristy! You're not! - [Man Whispering] Denise. (ominous music) (tense music) (engine stalling) - [Denise] Please! (engine roars) (suspenseful music) (Denise screaming) (tires schreech) (ominous music) (mysterious music) (Denise gasping) (engine stalling) (suspenseful music) (banging on car) Stop it! (men chuckling) (Denise grunts) (gun clicks) - Hey, lady. Watch that gun, we're not gonna hurt you. She's too chickenshit to shoot anybody. Come on. (ominous music) - That's funny, isn't it? God, everything's racing around in my head. The police should be at my place by now. Do you think I should give 'em a call? God, Karla, except for you, there's nobody else who knows about this but me. They'll never believe me. You see... - Four years ago, I was in the... But if you tell him what you know, that's the important thing. Is that people know. How can it go on if the people know? (gun clicks) (gunshot bangs) (dial tone ringing) (ominous music) - [Operator] If you'd like to make a call, please hang up and try again. If you need help, hang up and then dial your operator. (phone line beeping) - Well, if you wanna be around long enough to get your pension, get Patterson on the line, right now. - Patterson. Okay, so you knew the guy, so what? - Well, it makes sense with what he was asking me about yesterday. This Davis woman, what little blood was left in her drained into her legs. Same thing with the cab driver. And the Cutler girl, same deal. No, she may not be unrelated. Yeah, I know she drowned, but how did the blood get in her legs? (Artie groans) How do I know? Yeah, I got the DR forms. Thanks. There's something going on here. Maybe this time we'll see if we just can't get to the bottom of it. I'm gonna walk this sucker all the way to the top. Might be a promotion in it once I get it figured out. (typewriter clacking) - [Man Whispering] Arthur. (solemn music)
