Hey, hold this man. Hey, you, come. As you were. Name? Vincenzo Bugeja. Student. He was caught throwing stones at the soldiers. What's your name boy? Luigi Collins. Luigi, were you throwing stones at the soldiers too? And what did he do? Nothing. He stood by, watched the rioters and did nothing to stop them. Name? John Abela, 17 years old, he was caught in the middle of the riots. I saw what you did. And what did we do? Look, these are all boys. Did you catch the ringleaders? We made numerous arrests. That's not what I asked you. All right, take them away. Load them into the truck. Take them straight to prison. Sir! My, my, the garden has come up beautifully. Yes, Sir. What's your name? Yes, Sir. Do you understand me? Yes, Sir. Beautiful work. Thank you. Hup, hup, hup. Thank you Omar. Fergie. Your car is ready, Sir. Thank you. Blasted flies. Two hours is all we'll need to round up the agitators. I insist we send a strong message, shut down these clowns permanently. Pardon my forwardness. What is being proposed here is insane. We cut off the head, the body will fall. We cannot do what we want, there are laws. - We are the law. - The war is over. Sir, I'm still in touch with their leaders, I can bring them back to the negotiating table. If we do nothing that'd just be inviting more riots, more mayhem. Now you all remember what happened last February, they paralyzed the whole island with their strikes. And then went on the rampage, looting and burning shops and government offices. You're being overly dramatic, they just threw some eggs at the Malta Chronicle, that's all. A cowardly attack on the freedom of the press. The freedom of the press? The Chronicle writes what we tell them to write. Now, our authority's being challenged, over and over. The gloves have to come off. Sir, this island is vital. Precisely! And that's why we have to act now. We have to protect our interests. They have been loyal subjects for over a century. Some of these people are more British than the king himself. What?! Have you done your homework, man? Have you not read what's being written? Sir, our severity has helped to increase their ill behavior. War against civilians brings only pain. And you, of all the people in this room should know what I'm talking about. How dare you mention that. My boys died for their country, like any decent British soldier would do. I have always done my duty to the crown. Really? And what were you doing during the war? Gentlemen, gentlemen! May I may remind everyone that we represent civilization. I expect a mannerly conduct from all of you. Fergie, you have been somewhat silent. We're in a pickle, sir. Any bright ideas? I believe it would be reasonable to make sure that politicians know that if they incite any more violence, we'll fight fire with fire. How about that? It's just awful. Awful. It has been a long night. I want to thank you all for your advice. I have made my decision. There will be no arrests tonight and no deportations. I do not wish to rock the boat further. But, if any trouble starts then we will quash it by all means necessary. Make sure their people understand this. We'll reconvene tomorrow morning to follow proceedings. Goodnight gentlemen. If I may, we should move some troops closer to the city just as a precautionary measure. Tell me private, where is your gas mask? Gas mask? I don't have a gas mask. They didn't give you a gas mask? Do we need a gas mask? Private, everyone needs a gas mask. Stick with us, private, we'll look after you. This is Corporal Bell, I'm Private Colebrooke. What's your name? Private Love. I know, I know. It's not exactly The Ritz in Paris, but it'll do the regiment fine. Squad A, lower quarter. Squad B, upper quarters. Well, come on, move your arses men! Sharp! - Sargent. - Corporal. Corporal Bell! There'll be a room inspection in another hour, have the men ready. Yes, Sergeant. Let's go, let's go, let's go. Move it. Come on, hurry it through, hurry it through, hurry it through. Inspection in an hour, you heard the sergeant. How long have you been in the army, Private Love? Eight months. Well, don't let yourself get too worked up about it, Private. This isn't the war, this is Malta. Thank you Corporal Bell. Thank you for coming, Dr. Sceberras I'm very concerned about tomorrow's demonstration. These constant transgressions are making certain people uncomfortable. Our children are dying of hunger, that should make everyone be uncomfortable. Why won't you trust me? I've given you no reason not to. But this striking and protesting business has to stop now! The rifle and the bayonet are the primary weapons of the individual infantry soldier. Ah, very good Jenkins. Get to the back son. Private Love, let's see what you've got. Port arms son. On guard. Charge! And now, what the bloody hell was that? My grandfather can do 10 times better than that and he's been dead for the past 30 years. Get to the rear, you're doing it again. Double quick time. Take it in gentlemen, take it in. Take it in. James. James. - Viva Malta. - Viva Malta. Captain Ferguson. Is it confirmed? Speak. What's going on? The Union flag has been torn down from the university building. More British than the king himself! This circus has got to be shut down. Send in the troops. It will be wiser if we let the Maltese police handle this. What happened? What?! Their police have lost control of the situation, Sir. We've lost control of the city. Sending in the troops will only make matters worse. Look, what kind of a message are we sending to these people with us sitting here idle. We need to reach out to their politicians. Never! It's a sign of weakness. Quiet! I need some time alone. Colonel, Major you are excused. What am I to do? Right, get down, go, go, go. Move it. Look lively. Right slope formation. Point men join. The demonstrators have attacked buildings, here, here, and here, setting them on fire. I have dispatched two squads. Their orders are to clear sectors one, two and three. A second wave will follow within the next hour. The city will be surrounded by nightfall. The protesters? nothing but rats in a trap. Fan out! Right, at ease lads. Corporal! Yes, Sergeant? Right, situation on the ground is as follows. Protests have turned violent and the bastards are making a mess of the place as we speak. We're gonna restore order the British Army way. Any questions, son? Do we have any intelligence on the number of hostiles? It's an outright rebellion against King and Empire. Everyone is a bloody hostile! - Yes, Sergeant! - All right. I'll take squad A, you take squad B. We meet up here as soon as you've cleared up your target. - Got that? - Yes, Sergeant. Right, squad A with me, double quick time, march! Squad B with me, double quick time, march! Come on, keep moving. Come on, Price, hurry up. Tall halt! At ease. Where the bloody hell are we? Bloody hell! What a charming place. Right lads, maintain your composure. Port arms. Quick march. Squad halt. Right men, stand down, two minutes break. Under the arches, move, move. Keep your eyes up. Good God, man, you stink. With all due respect Corporal, look at your helmet. Oh, Jesus Christ. Well spotted Love. Go and wash that in the water fountain. Please take it quick. - Corporal. - Thank you. All right, Colebrooke, down. I don't like these narrow streets. Next time it could be a lot worse than shit raining down on us from above. Right, we are here. We need to get to here. We can try the rooftops. Yes, good. Good idea. Not just a pretty face, Colebrooke. Not just a pretty face! Thank you, Corporal. Move. Move! Get out the way. Colebrooke. Colebrooke! Let's go. Tall halt. Right lads, for King and Empire. One section, right flank. Two section, left flank. Three section, extremes. One section, move! Two section, move! Three section, move! What in God's name do we have here? All right lads, glory waits for no man. Open it. I should be topping up my tan, not dealing with this shit. Hey! Do you know how much fanny you're gonna get when you go home. Girls love a hero. But, maybe get a shower first. Fix bayonets. Colebrooke, Jenkins, Price keep the rear. Yes, Corporal. The rest of you with me. Let's show these bastards who they're fucking with. Charge bayonets. Stay low. Stay close to Bell. Do what he does, yes? Cover the door. So, how did that feel Love? There are two dead civilians outside. So what? With me. Fuk Britin. Educated by fucking monkeys. Jenkins! All clear, Corporal. Good. - Do a head count please. - Yes, Corp. Get out. Oh, you are in so much trouble now boy. And a thief. Sit down. Sit down. Now... Now, fuck Britain. F-U-C-K B-R-I-T-A-I-N. Fuck Britain. And when you can spell Britain properly, you can wear the Foreign Service hat. Oh, I'm sure that was something lovely. After him. Uh, uh, uh! Oh, geez. Leave him, man. Take him away. Feeling better?

I thought you'd left. I've been out on the streets. I've been here for six years trying to make it work between us and them. And you destroyed all that in 24 hours. Our actions were necessary. There are dead people, innocent people. Well, everything has its price. It's just the way the world turns. Margerie and I gave up our boys for the cause. They were ordered to ride bravely towards the enemy fire. They were barely 20. Spilled their blood for us, in the mud, in a French field. We could barely pronounce the name. Where is the morality in that? Hmm? I'll ask the governor to commission a public enquiry. Fee-fi-fo-fum, I smell the blood of mortal scum. Right flank. Wreck the place! They tell me that the situation seems to be well in hand. That's correct, Sir. Our casualties are at 0%. Then why do I still hear gunfire? I beg your pardon, Sir, but there's the President of the Maltese Assembly inside. He's asking for an urgent meeting. Do you think history will be charitable to us? Our troops behaved gallantly and with honor, Sir, in very difficult circumstances. I believe history will extol our efforts to secure the Empire. Sir, what shall I tell your visitors? Corporal. Beautiful view. It's not bad. Get your gear together, we're moving out in five. Wonderful. I can't wait. What's wrong with you? I think some days are just best forgotten. Don't you? We've done good today. It depends on your definition of good. We've seen blood before, Private. We'll see it again. Great to see you, Sergeant. Well considering you took your time to get here, son, well, sort this mess out yourself. - Go on. - Yes, Sergeant. Front three, point men. Move, move. Charge! Charge! Go, go, go. Clear, Sergeant. Let's go. You! You, stay where you are. Don't shoot. Don't shoot. Don't shoot. Don't shoot! Don't shoot! Colebrooke. Colebrooke, what happened? Don't move. Price, clear the area. Clear, clear. Private Love, all right? What happened here? Speak up lads. Hey you, come. Did he leave? Yes, Sir. He insisted I gave you this. What's wrong with you? Nothings wrong. We did our duty. I know. Do I need to worry about you, Colebrooke? No, no need to worry. - You sure? - Yes. We're in this together. One of us goes down, we all go down. Private Love is right. Yes, but they were civilians and you know it. And I was trying to protect you. We did what we had to do for King and Country, that's our story! Us or them. Are we in agreement? Colebrooke? You awake? I couldn't sleep. Luigi? John! John? Enter. 7734434. Private Colebrooke. Carry on. Sir! Remove headdress. Tell us what happened. Come on, we don't have all day. Came under attack. Louder. Please. We were under attack, Sir. It was us or them. Dismissed. Sir! - Viva Malta! - Viva Malta! Woo! Viva Malta!
