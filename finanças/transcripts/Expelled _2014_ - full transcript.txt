I thought that was three‎. ‎- Two‎, felix‎. Two suspensions‎. The first was in september for rewiring the cheerleaders fund‎-raiser money to a koala bear sanctuary‎. ‎- Noble cause‎, don't you think‎? ‎- I think you owe an apology to a dozen cheerleaders‎. ‎- I think there are two dozen koalas that would disagree with that‎, gary‎. ‎- And then again‎, in october for programming the gym scoreboard to display an indecent photo of mrs‎. Jensen‎. ‎- Whoo‎! ‎- I think I did everyone a favor with that one‎. ‎- I'm not gonna play games with you‎, felix‎. Two suspensions in a single semester is unheard of here at eastwood‎. ‎- Mr‎. Truman‎, I understand I'm‎.‎.‎. I'm not what you'd consider an exemplary student‎. But I believe I play a pivotal role in the operations of this school‎. If I wasn't here to test the rules‎, how would the other students even know they existed‎? ‎- Today I was told that you hacked the vending machines to give out free gum to students‎. Is that true‎? ‎- Gum‎? ‎- Are you trying to get expelled‎? ‎- And deny you the pleasure of my company‎? ‎- I'm expelling you‎, felix‎. That's it‎. ‎- Wait‎. Seriously‎? ‎- That was your third strike‎. ‎- So that means I‎-I can't come to class anymore‎? ‎- Oh‎, you'll never set foot in the school again‎. ‎- Gary‎.‎.‎. I don't know how to thank you‎. incredible‎. I spent my whole school career trying to ditch class‎, and they punish me by giving me an early retirement‎. Right now mr‎. Truman is about to call my mom to let her know about my expulsion‎. I can't let that happen‎. ‎- Oh‎! Oh‎! ‎- On average‎, an eastwood high fire drills take 11 minutes‎. I only need 10‎. ‎- Yo‎, felix‎! ‎- Danny boy‎. What's up‎, buddy‎? ‎- You pulled the fire alarm again‎? ‎- Of course‎. Did I get you out of that trig test‎? ‎- You got me out of the trig test‎. ‎- Timed it perfectly‎. ‎- Yeah‎. Yo‎, I heard you got suspended‎. ‎- Nope‎, expelled‎. ‎- Whoa‎, what‎? Are you serious‎? ‎- Yeah‎. ‎- Dude‎, your parents are gonna kill you‎. ‎- Only if they find out‎, and they won't‎. ‎- What makes you say that‎? ‎- We'll talk soon‎. I got a take an important call in eight and a half minutes‎. ‎- You're insane‎! ‎- I programmed my mom's phone to forward her calls to my skype account‎. When mr‎. Truman calls‎, I'll just‎.‎.‎. excuse me‎. I got to take this‎. Hello‎? Expelled‎? ‎- Expelled‎, mrs‎. O'neil‎. We have a three‎-strike policy here at eastwood‎, and that was his third strike‎. ‎- What are we gonna do with him‎? ‎- What are we gonna do with him‎? ‎- Who‎, me‎? ‎- No‎, not you‎. Ben‎. ‎- What happened‎? I thought he was improving‎. ‎- His grades are getting worse‎. ‎- Last year‎, my brother‎, ben‎, forged a report card‎. When my parents found out‎, they sent him to the mountain disciplinary academy‎. Located in the foot hills of montana‎, it's more of a jail than a school‎. There's bar on windows‎, wardens instead of teachers‎. I heard it smells like butthole‎. ‎- He got a 1‎.7 gpa‎. Unbelievable‎. ‎- What about you‎, felix‎? How are things at school‎? ‎- Things are great‎. I aced my trig test‎. ‎- There you go‎. ‎- Wow‎. Great job‎, kiddo‎. ‎- Yep‎. Studied for it all week‎. ‎- I like to hear that‎. ‎- Yes‎. ‎- Diane says the report cards are coming out in a few days‎. ‎- Mm‎, and what kind of grades can we expect to see‎? ‎- Lots of "a" s‎. ‎- Aw‎. ‎- Looks like I'm gonna need a new report card‎. Getting a decent report card here at eastwood is pretty difficult‎.‎.‎. Slightly more difficult when you've been expelled‎. There are only seven people with the power to print a report card‎. Just one of them is a student‎. She's mr‎. Truman's t‎.A‎. She also happens to be my bitter ex‎-girlfriend‎. ‎- Someone's coming‎. ‎- I do not have time to talk to you‎. ‎- You haven't heard what I want talk about‎. ‎- Now we've already talked more than I wanted‎. ‎- I need a report card‎. ‎- Then I suggest going back to school‎, preferably somewhere far from here‎. ‎- Ouch‎. Or you could just print one for me‎. No‎. ‎- Um‎, weren't you expelled‎? ‎- Um‎, yeah‎. ‎- Can you please go‎? ‎- Any reason you keep covering stacy's anti‎-bullying postings‎? ‎- I want to win‎. ‎- I can help with that‎. I don't think so‎. ‎- Oh‎, come on‎. We both know I can‎. ‎- Vanessa‎, don't‎. He's trouble‎. ‎- Can you finish this for me‎? Sure‎. ‎- Bye‎. ‎- So stacy's favored to win this thing‎. Yeah‎, I figured‎. ‎- So how do I beat her‎? ‎- Oh‎, it's actually really simple‎. Just hand out cute little marshmallows with your name on them‎. ‎- Do I need to slap you‎? ‎- Hey‎, guys‎? Could you possibly get off the stairs‎? You're in the shot‎. ‎- It blows my mind that people like her so much‎. ‎- Hey‎, hey‎, come over here‎. I'll interview you for my bullying segment‎. ‎- I want you to end her‎. ‎- That can be arranged‎. Can you get me my report card‎? ‎- Yes‎, I can get you a report card‎. ‎- Great‎. I'll take straight "a" s‎, please‎. ‎- Do you have the slightest clue as to how much work goes into getting straight "a" s‎? ‎- Mm‎.‎.‎. Don't care‎. I'll take straight "a" s‎, please‎. ‎- Done‎. What's the plan‎? ‎- All it takes is a single tweet‎. ‎- Roxy‎? ‎- Roxy‎. Meet roxy‎. Roxy is infamous for ruining the lives of students with vicious rumors‎. I am no exception‎. "Leave it to felix o'neil to creep on the girl's bathroom "through a hole on the ceiling‎. ♪ Peepingtom‎." It all happened when vanessa and I were dating freshman year‎. After school‎, I tried to break into the library to borrow a new p‎.C‎. Aah‎! This isn't the boys' bathroom‎. ‎- A single tweet caused the bitter end of my sweet‎, sweet relationship with vanessa‎. danny‎! What are you doing here‎? ‎- I need help with something‎. ‎- Seriously‎, though‎, where the hell did you just come from‎? ‎- The window‎. ‎- You scared me half to death‎, man‎. ‎- Oh‎! ‎- I apologize‎. I need you to help me hack into roxy‎. ‎- And I need you to shut your mouth‎. How's that‎? Cool‎. ‎- Is there a problem here‎? ‎- Uh‎, yeah‎, there is a problem‎. I don't like hacking into things that can tweet my social life out of existence‎. ‎- No‎. Yeah‎, yeah‎, but that's the thing‎. If we had roxy's password‎, we could control the tweets‎. ‎- Go on‎. ‎- We could delete them or‎.‎.‎. Post them‎. ‎- We can post them‎? I mean‎, I guess it wouldn't hurt to just get the password‎. ‎- Yes‎, exactly‎! Do your thing‎, man‎. Do your thing‎. how's it coming‎? ‎- You may want to sit down for this‎. Password acquired‎. And I also found roxy's I‎.P‎. Address‎. ‎- You got the I‎.P‎. Address‎? How‎? ‎- Worked a little bit of my magic and found a back door into twitter‎. ‎- Are you kidding‎? ‎- Nope‎. Nearly pooped my pants from excitement‎. I know roxy's true identity‎. ‎- Shut up and show me‎. Holy‎.‎.‎. Crap‎. ‎- I heard it said that bullying creates bullies‎.‎.‎. a vicious cycle that will continue until someone makes a stand against it‎. I am here to make that stand‎. When you vote today‎, remember I am here to make eastwood high bully‎-free‎. Thank you‎. Thank you‎, guys‎. Vote stacy‎. ‎- These people need to know the truth‎. ‎- We need to expose her‎. ‎- Let's just beat her to death‎. ‎- She'll lose the race if she is exposed‎. ‎- She'll lose the race if we beat her to death‎. ‎- Vanessa‎, would you relax a little bit‎? ‎- Fine‎. How do we expose her‎? ‎- With this‎. ‎- We put a video on there with all of the information linking stacy to roxy‎. ‎- We're gonna patch into the school's tv system‎. Then we're gonna broadcast it live to the entire school during the video announcements‎. ‎- Excuse me‎. What the hell are you doing here‎? ‎- Hi‎, gary‎. ‎- What do I have to do to get through to you‎? Do I need to call the police‎? ‎- I don't think that'll be necessary‎. ‎- What are you planning to do with this‎, huh‎? ‎- Uh‎, that's just a school project that I've been working on‎. ‎- Yeah‎, another one of your pranks‎? ‎- No‎, I just‎.‎.‎. ‎- Listen to me very carefully‎. If I see you on my campus again‎, I'll have you in handcuffs in front of all your little friends‎. Do you understand‎? ‎- sure‎. ‎- Leave‎.‎.‎. Now‎. ‎- We need another copy of that video before the announcements‎. ‎- It's impossible‎. It would take hours to run home and render a new one‎. There's just not enough time‎. ‎- But the student body votes today‎. ‎- Yeah‎. I think you're boned‎. ‎- And that solves the mystery of our faulty fire‎-alarm system‎. Up next‎, an anti‎-bullying segment from stacy richards‎. ‎- At eastwood high there is one bully that has caused more torment than any other‎.‎.‎. roxy‎. If I'm elected‎, I will stop at nothing to bring roxy to justice‎. ‎- I can help with that‎. Good morning‎, eastwood high‎. It is my genuine pleasure to reveal the true identity of the anonymous cyber bully‎, known as‎.‎.‎. Roxy‎. ‎- He must've patched into the system‎. But how did he get on tv‎? ‎- He's doing it live‎. ‎- And basically‎, I'm gonna screw her‎. ‎- What the hell is this‎? ‎- Shh‎. ‎- Behind me is roxy's I‎.P‎. Address‎, which I acquired by a brute‎-force hacking of the twitter account‎. If stacy richards is truly searching for roxy‎, she doesn't have to search very far‎. ‎- He's in the cheerleaders' closet‎. ‎- This is stacy richards' I‎.P‎. Address‎.‎.‎. a perfect match with the one associated with‎.‎.‎. Roxy‎! ‎- Open it‎. Oh‎, for the love of god‎, come on‎! Oh‎! ‎- Aah‎! ‎- so here it is‎, folks‎.‎.‎. straight "a" s‎, courtesy of my girl vanessa‎. ‎- What you got there‎? Are those your grades‎? ‎- Uh‎.‎.‎. Nope‎, it's vanessa's death certificate‎. ‎- Felix‎. Are those your grades‎? ‎- Uh‎.‎.‎. ‎- Felix‎! Hey‎! Hey‎, mister‎, you just don't take off‎. ‎- I probably could've handled that better‎, but one thing is certain‎, my parents must never see that report card‎, for if they do‎, they'll simultaneously crap their pants‎. ‎- Oh‎! ‎- Most parents would consider disowning you for an "f" on your report card‎. Seven "f" s is a different story‎. That right there is a death sentence‎. What is this‎? ‎- It's your report card‎, silly‎. ‎- Funny‎. I distinctly remember asking for straight "a" s‎. Those appear to be "f" s‎. ‎- Hmm‎, looks like you got the report card you deserve‎. ‎- This is what I deserve for helping you‎? ‎- You've never worked for anything in your life‎, have you‎, felix‎? ‎- What are you talking about‎? ‎- You can't expect to walk out of here in the top percentile without ever applying yourself‎. I'm not gonna help you cheat your way to the top‎. ‎- Are you insane‎? I helped you cheat your way into the presidency‎. ‎- I earned that presidency‎. I've been working towards it for the last three years‎. Do you have any idea how hard I worked‎? ‎- I'm gonna give you five minutes to fix my report card‎. ‎- Fix it‎! ‎- Or what‎? What's gonna happen if I don't‎? ‎- Use your imagination‎. ‎- Two minutes to curtain‎. ‎- So how do you want to play this‎? ‎- Excuse me‎. I have a play to star in‎, but good luck with the report card‎. I'm sure your parents will be really proud‎. ‎- Anyone can be a jerk‎, but vanessa makes it in art form‎. She's a rare breed‎, an innovator‎. That straight‎-f report card was her crowning achievement‎. ‎- ¶ I close my eyes ¶ ¶ I surrender ¶ ¶ to you ¶ ¶ I lie awake these sleepless nights ¶ ¶ you walked away and took my life ¶ get off the stage‎. What are you doing‎? ‎- ¶ You betrayed me ¶ ¶ you betrayed me ¶ ‎- ¶ all I wanted ¶ ¶ was one last kiss ¶ ‎- ¶ you got it‎, baby ¶ ¶ kiss this booty ¶ ‎- ¶ oh ¶ ¶ what does your heart tell you‎? ¶ ‎- it's him‎. ‎- ¶ My heart tells me ¶ ¶ that you're a traitorous butt‎-munch ¶ ‎- take off the mask‎! ‎- ¶ The mask stays on ¶ hey‎, guys‎. ‎- Where were you‎? ‎- I was at school‎. ‎- "At school"‎? Why‎? ‎- What's going on‎, felix‎? ‎- I was‎.‎.‎. Gonna explain that to you‎. ‎- What is this‎? ‎- The school play‎.‎.‎. I'm in it‎. ‎- You never told me about a school play‎. ‎- Yeah‎, the premiere was tonight‎, and I totally forgot‎. ‎- And‎.‎.‎. That's why you ran off like you did before‎? ‎- That is correct‎. ‎- So‎.‎.‎. What character were you playing‎? ‎- The clown‎.‎.‎. Wizard‎. ‎- "The clown wizard"‎? ‎- Yeah‎, people love me‎. ‎- "Musical"‎? I didn't know you could sing‎. ‎- Yeah‎, I do‎. I do sing a little‎. ‎- Yeah‎, well‎.‎.‎. Sing us something‎. Sing us something from the play‎. ‎- Well‎, I‎-I don't‎.‎.‎. I don't‎.‎.‎. I can't‎.‎.‎. ‎- yeah‎, this just doesn't make any sense‎. ‎- ¶ I am the wizard ¶ ¶ a clown wizard ¶ ‎- hey‎, honey‎. ‎- Good morning‎, mom‎. ‎- Listen‎.‎.‎. It was unfair of me to be like that last night‎. ‎- I'm sorry‎. ‎- It's cool‎, mom‎. Don't worry about it‎. I understand‎. ‎- I am just anxious to see your grades‎, that's all‎. ‎- There's really nothing to be anxious about‎. They just haven't sent them out yet‎. ‎- Maybe yours were sent to the wrong address‎. ‎- Possibly‎. ‎- I should talk to someone over there‎. ‎- No‎. ‎- I'll take you to school‎. ‎- No‎, it's fine‎. I'll just ride my bike‎. ‎- Are you sure‎? ‎- Yep‎. I need the exercise anyways‎. ‎- Have a good day‎. ‎- Will do‎, daddy‎-o‎. ‎- And don't be late‎. ‎- Impossible‎! ever had a snow day‎? Pretty cool‎, right‎? You get the whole day off because of some wretched weather‎. Being expelled is kind of like that‎.‎.‎. Except the weather's awesome‎. Your life is a never‎-ending series of missed opportunities‎. At any given moment‎, you are completely surrounded by them‎. You just got to know where to look‎. This room‎, for example‎.‎.‎. what do you see‎? Anything‎? Time's up‎. Here's what you might've missed‎.‎.‎. $4‎.67 under the couch cushion‎.‎.‎. Decorative boomerang bought by my dad‎, never been thrown a single time‎.‎.‎. shame‎. You think this is just for blowing leaves‎? Think again‎! Opportunities‎.‎.‎. they're all around you‎.‎.‎. Unless you're in history class‎. ‎- hey‎, there‎. ‎- Hi‎. Nice robe‎. ‎- Thank you‎. It's‎, uh‎, $18‎.50‎. ‎- One second‎. Um‎.‎.‎. ‎- You look familiar‎. Do you go to eastwood‎? ‎- Yeah‎, I used to‎.‎.‎. Till I got expelled‎. ‎- That's right‎.‎.‎. for the pranks‎. I liked your work with the koala bears‎. ‎- Thank you‎. ‎- Uh‎, it's $18‎.50‎. ‎- You think you could help me get that down‎? ‎- Um‎.‎.‎. That depends on how much you're gonna tip me‎. ‎- Does $4‎.67 tickle your fancy‎? Almost‎.‎.‎. it's about a foot to the left‎. Come on‎, you got it‎. ‎- Really‎? Am I almost there‎? ‎- Yeah‎, almost there‎. Just jump‎.‎.‎. jump a little higher‎. Oh‎! ‎- You almost hit me‎. ‎- I did‎? Good‎. ‎- Oh‎, that was so close‎. You got this‎. ‎- One more‎, one more‎, one more‎. Wait‎. It's fine‎. Go ahead‎. Yes‎! ‎- Oh‎! ‎- Well‎.‎.‎. There goes your tip‎. What‎? No‎, stop‎. I'm kidding‎. Stop‎. I like her‎. These grades right here are a one‎-way ticket to montana‎. If I don't turn these "f"s into "a"s‎, my vacation's gonna end very quickly‎. ‎- Yo‎. How's early retirement‎? ‎- Incredible‎. I got to be honest with you‎. I'm pretty envious‎. ‎- I would be too‎. Pizza‎? ‎- What's the catch‎? ‎- "Catch"‎? ‎- Yeah‎, you show up to my house unexpected‎, there's a catch‎. ‎- No‎.‎.‎. Just pizza‎. ‎- I swear to god‎, man‎, if there are any catches‎, I'm gonna slap you in the mouth‎. ‎- Zero catches‎. ‎- Okay‎. All right‎. Okay‎, cool‎. ‎- I need you to help me break into the school‎. ‎- Pizza slap‎! no‎. This is insane‎. ‎- Which part‎? ‎- All of it‎. All‎.‎.‎. all of it is insane‎. ‎- Can you be more specific‎? ‎- Yeah‎. You want to destroy the school's security camera with super string ‎- "Super string"‎? Who calls it that‎? ‎- I don't‎.‎.‎. whatever it's called‎, we're not using it‎. ‎- Fine‎. Would you rather use spray paint‎? ‎- No‎, I'd rather not have a plan that hinges on sprayable string‎. ‎- Okay‎. Anything else‎? ‎- Uh‎, yeah‎, step one‎.‎.‎. I'm not stealing the janitor's keys‎. I mean‎, the guy looks like jeffrey Dahmer‎. Come on‎. That dude's a sweetheart‎. So you in‎? I can't do this without you‎, man‎. ‎- I will help you hack the grading system under one condition‎. ‎- Which is‎? ‎- We need to change my biology grade‎. ‎- Why‎? What'd you get‎? ‎- I'm failing‎.‎.‎. So is half of the entire class‎. ‎- We'll just have to change your grade‎, then‎. ‎- Who are we gonna get the security code from‎? ‎- I hear the assistant librarian has it‎. ‎- Who is the assistant librarian‎? ‎- Stacy richards‎.‎.‎. Or should I say "roxy"‎? ‎- You can't be here‎. You're expelled‎. ‎- And you're suspended‎, so that makes two of us‎. ‎- I'm still allowed to participate in extracurricular activities‎. ‎- Well‎, perfect‎, 'cause I got a great extracurricular activity for you‎. ‎- Mrs‎. Taylor‎. ‎- Aw‎, you're turning me in‎? ‎- Mrs‎. Taylor‎? ‎- Sure you want to do that‎? I can give you straight "a"s‎. ‎- I already have straight "a"s‎. ‎- Yeah‎, but what good are straight "a"s when you have a suspension on your record‎? ‎- Yes‎, hon‎. ‎- I could make that disappear‎, you know‎. ‎- What is it‎, stacy‎? ‎- Your record would be completely clean‎. ‎- Never mind‎. What exactly do you need from me‎? ‎- The keys to the school and the code for the alarm system‎, please‎. ‎- What makes you think I have either of those things‎? ‎- Because those things are necessary for assistant librarians to open the library on saturday morning‎. ‎- It's the one that says "do not copy"‎. ‎- Yes‎, I know which one it is‎. Thank you‎. What do you plan to do with it exactly‎? ‎- Copy it‎. ‎- No‎, stupid‎, I mean‎, what is your course of action‎? ‎- Well‎.‎.‎. Due to new security measures‎, my colleague and I have determined that it is impossible to hack the grading system from the outside‎. We need access to truman's computer‎, and for that‎, we will need one key and one security system code‎, which is‎.‎.‎.‎? 1‎,036‎. ‎- Oh‎! Like the number of parties you missed‎. ‎- Or the number of jobs you won't qualify for‎. ‎- Ouch‎. ‎- Felix‎? ‎- Hey‎, mom‎. ‎- It's late‎, honey‎. What's going on‎? ‎- Uh‎, just a chemistry project‎.‎.‎. For school‎, school chemistry‎. ‎- "Chemistry"‎? ‎- Yeah‎. ‎- Is this a‎.‎.‎. ‎- Smoke bomb‎. ‎- Yeah‎. ‎- Yes‎. Yes‎, it is‎. ‎- All right‎, well‎, don't go blowing yourself up ‎- or anything‎. ‎- I won't‎. ‎- And get to bed at a reasonable hour‎. Danny‎. What are you wearing‎? ‎- Me‎? I'm dressed like a normal human‎. ‎- You‎? ‎- Well‎.‎.‎. I'm wearing black stuff‎, b‎-burglary stuff‎. ‎- You can't do that‎. ‎- Why can I not do that‎? ‎- Are you robbing a bank‎? ‎- What‎? ‎- Are you‎? ‎- Maybe I am‎. ‎- Oh‎, then by all means‎, dress like that‎. I'm just wondering where your big money bag is with the dollar sign on it‎? ‎- Oh‎, oh‎. You're so funny‎, yeah‎, let me go‎.‎.‎. I'm gonna go do that real quick‎. I'll do that‎. ‎- Okay‎, wait‎. Hold up‎, hold up‎, hold up‎. Can we‎.‎.‎. can we think about this for just a split second‎? Like‎, we're about to commit a‎-a legit crime right now‎. Do you understand the gravity of the situation at all‎? Okay‎, I take that as a no‎. Great‎. Ow‎. Oh‎. All right‎, all right‎, all right‎. What the hell‎, man‎? I told you‎.‎.‎. no super string‎. ‎- What is it with you and super string‎? ‎- Nothing‎. You know what‎? Let's just‎.‎.‎. we'll forget about it‎. ‎- No‎, no‎. What‎, what‎? Whoa‎, wait‎. Do you have‎, like‎, some dark history with string‎? Were your parents killed by strings‎? ‎- No‎, you douche‎. I am allergic to latex‎. I can't be around super string 'cause it burns my skin‎. ‎- Relax‎. I'm just gonna black out the camera‎. ‎- Oh‎, my god‎! I'm so sorry‎! ‎- This is my nightmare‎. ‎- Shh‎! ‎- This is my nightmare‎! It's everywhere‎! ‎- I'm sorry‎. I'm sorry‎. ‎- The knot was on the wrong way‎. ‎- Oh‎, I bet it was‎. ‎- Are you good‎? ‎- Yeah‎, oh‎, I'm perfectly fine‎, you moron‎. ‎- How many times‎.‎.‎. ‎- Shh‎. ‎- Did I say it‎? I said‎, "no super string"‎! ‎- Jeez‎. ‎- I am sorry‎. I didn't know‎. ‎- Oh‎, "you're sorry‎. You didn't know‎." ‎- Ready‎? Yeah‎, I'm ready‎. ‎- Yeah‎. Boom town‎. ‎- Don't celebrate yet‎, man‎. ‎- Hey‎, hey‎. Don't make me use this‎, bro‎. ‎- Are you looking to get punched in the balls today‎? Don't‎.‎.‎. hey‎! No‎. Felix‎. No‎! Don't‎! Felix‎, no‎! ‎- What‎? ‎- I can't do it‎. He'll wake up‎. ‎- So how are we gonna move the laptop‎? ‎- We don't have to‎. ‎- Where did you even find this‎? ‎- I got it from truman's desk‎. Shh‎. ‎- And‎.‎.‎. Got it‎. ‎- You're a wizard‎, danny‎. ‎- You know it‎, bitch‎. ‎- What are you doing‎? ‎- I'm bugging his computer to keep tabs on him‎. ‎- "Keep tabs"‎? ‎- Yeah‎. If he figures out that we tampered with the grades‎, we're gonna want to know about it‎. ‎- Ah‎, got it‎. ‎- Now let's change your biology grade‎. ‎- Yes‎, let's do that‎. Okay‎, what gpa do you want‎? ‎- 3‎.5 should be good‎. ‎- 4‎.0 coming right up‎. Really‎? ‎- Yeah‎. What‎, you don't want straight "a" s‎? ‎- All right‎. Do it‎. 4‎.0 it is‎. There it is‎.‎.‎. straight "a" s‎, baby‎. ‎- Crap‎, I got to put this back‎. ‎- Oh‎, no way‎, man‎. It's mine now‎. ‎- I got to put it back on his desk‎. He's gonna know we were here‎. ‎- What are you doing here‎, felix‎? ‎- What are you doing here‎, mr‎. Truman‎? It's 2:00 in the morning‎. ‎- Uh‎-huh‎. Waiting for the police to arrive‎. What brings you here this time‎.‎.‎. stealing computers again‎? ‎- I think I'm gonna have to break your window‎, mr‎. Truman‎. ‎- If you think that'll help‎, son‎, knock yourself out‎. What do you want‎, felix‎? ‎- If you could let me go‎, that'd be great‎. ‎- No‎, no‎, no‎. I mean‎, what is it that you want‎, huh‎? What kind a future do you see for yourself‎? Have you ever even thought about it‎? ‎- I know what I don't want‎. I don't want a seat behind a desk for the next six years‎.‎.‎. So I can get a job and sit behind a desk for the next 40‎. I'm trying to live‎.‎.‎. Every second of my life to the fullest‎. And‎.‎.‎. You're making that really difficult‎, mr‎. Truman‎. ‎- Police‎, open up‎! ‎- He's over here‎, officer‎. ‎- Put your hands behind your back‎. Very rarely do I say this‎, but I am‎, without a doubt‎, 100% boned this time‎. On the bright side‎, montana can't be much worse than this‎. This could be difficult to explain to my parents‎. What do you think‎? I never planned to end up like my brother‎. ‎- Your dad's here to pick you up‎. ‎- Excellent‎. ‎- Come on out‎. ‎- Hey‎, there‎, son‎. ‎- Mr‎. O'neil‎? ‎- Do you happen to have a moist towelette‎, by chance‎? ‎- Your son's in a lot of trouble‎. ‎- What‎? Felix‎, I am disappointed in you‎, son‎! Super‎, super disappointed‎! ‎- I'm so sorry‎, dad‎. ‎- Ready‎, son‎? ‎- Yep‎. ‎- All right‎, then‎. See you‎. ‎- You know‎, I was expecting you to be a little bit more upset‎, dad‎. Or can I call you "ben" now‎? ‎- It's good to see you‎, little bro‎. ‎- Seriously‎. I missed you‎, man‎. ‎- I missed you too‎. How did you know is me‎? ‎- I mean‎, it wasn't hard to recognize you‎, even with that little creep‎-stache‎. What made you think that would work‎? ‎- It did work‎, and you're welcome‎. ‎- Sorry‎, I just‎.‎.‎. I just can't believe he bought it‎. What are you doing here‎, anyway‎? ‎- Well‎, that one is kind of hard to explain‎. I haven't really told mom and dad yet about the whole "great escape" thing‎, so‎.‎.‎. ‎- You okay there‎? ‎- Yeah‎. ‎- I know a shortcut‎. ‎- My brother's a different class of troublemaker‎. He's been caught more times than I can count‎, but he always manages to power through‎. He's a veteran rule‎-breaker‎. Me‎? I prefer a more subtle approach‎. ‎- Oh‎, yeah‎. ‎- Mm‎. ‎- Come on‎. ‎- I got to say‎.‎.‎. you definitely save my ass from the mountain academy‎. ‎- Yeah‎, you don't want to go there‎. ‎- So‎.‎.‎. How did you escape‎? Isn't that place‎, like‎, maximum security‎? ‎- To be honest‎, it was pretty easy‎. ‎- How‎? ‎- I shipped myself out‎. Last semester I got a job in the mail room‎. Every monday I would sort through everybody's letters from a giant sack‎. The other kids starting calling me "sack boy‎." But I had the last laugh‎. I was supposed to ship back a broken tandem bike from our fitness class‎. But there was just enough space for me to crawl inside‎. So I hopped in the box and I shipped myself to freedom‎. ‎- Wait‎. Seriously‎? How were you able to breathe‎? ‎- There was plenty of oxygen‎, as I recall‎. The box was shipped ground‎. ‎- Wait‎, wait‎, wait‎. ‎- So you just changed the address on the box‎? ‎- Shipped myself right to our doorstep‎, baby‎. ‎- The crate‎.‎.‎. you were in that crate‎. ‎- Yes‎, dude‎, you walked right pass me‎. ‎- Oh‎. ‎- Stretching my legs was‎.‎.‎. Borderline orgasmic‎. Sneaking into the house was easy‎. Finding a permanent hiding spot was even easier‎. I quickly discovered that the attic is the most badass part of the house‎. My old box of toys was up there‎. So was santa claus‎. It was a little cramped‎, but I made do with what I had‎. For the last few days‎, I've been living in the attic‎, off of hot dogs and candy‎. Hello‎? When I heard you were arrested‎, I immediately knew what had to be done‎. Oh‎, yes‎. This is certainly him‎. ‎- We're gonna need you to pick him up at the station‎. ‎- Absolutely‎. I'll be right there to pick him up‎, 'cause I'm his dad‎. ‎- I mean this in the best possible way‎, but you are insane‎. I can't thank you enough‎, man‎. ‎- Of course‎, dude‎. I got you‎. ‎- You do know that we are about five miles from the house‎. Are we walking the whole way‎? ‎- Nope‎. I fixed it‎.‎.‎. Sort of‎. ‎- Dude‎, what is wrong with this bike‎? ‎- A lot of things‎. Sorry‎. Okay‎, nice and easy‎. What are you doing‎? ‎- What do you mean‎? ‎- You can't use the front door‎, the alarm system activates after 10:00‎. Get it together‎, man‎. ‎- Okay‎. What are you doing‎? ‎- I'm gonna sneak through my bedroom window‎. ‎- Are you kidding me‎? It's right next to mom and dad's room‎. They're gonna hear you when you go on the roof‎. ‎- Okay‎. So how do you suggest that we get in‎? ‎- The living‎-room window‎. ‎- The living‎-room window‎. That's a rookie move‎, and you know it‎. That window squeaks‎. ‎- I have done this a thousand times‎, felix‎. ‎- So have I‎. ‎- All right‎, you don't get it‎. It's my patootie if we get caught‎. Mom and dad are gonna send me right back to montana‎. Not gonna happen‎. Executive decision‎.‎.‎. we're going through the living‎-room window‎. ‎- Let's go‎. ‎- Fine‎. But once you're in the attic‎, you need to be absolutely silent‎. Mom is the world's lightest sleeper‎. ‎- You don't need to tell me this‎, man‎. I'll be as quiet as a rodent‎. ‎- Mouse‎, as quiet as a mouse‎. ‎- A mouse is a rodent‎. ‎- Yeah‎, but so is a squirrel‎. ‎- Squirrels are relatively quiet‎, man‎. ‎- I'm gonna kill you‎. ‎- Okay‎, all right‎. Sorry‎. Go‎, go‎, go‎. ‎- Honey‎? Is that you‎? ‎- This way‎, this way‎. Come on‎, this way‎. ‎- Hey‎. ‎- Hey‎. ‎- What happened to going to bed at a reasonable hour‎? ‎- I did‎, I was asleep‎, I just really needed a‎.‎.‎. ‎- Banana‎. ‎- Don't touch that‎. It was expensive‎. ‎- Really‎? ‎- The bowl‎. ‎- Oh‎. I got a call tonight from the mountain academy about your brother‎. ‎- Yeah‎. ‎- They can't find him‎. He escaped‎. They've been searching the area‎, and they haven't found anything yet‎. I am just‎.‎.‎. I am worried to death‎. ‎- I‎-I know your brother‎.‎.‎. ‎- Mom‎. ‎- And I know what he's capable of‎, and I‎.‎.‎. ‎- it's okay‎. Ben's gonna be fine‎. ‎- You don't happen to know anything about this‎, do you‎? ‎- No‎. No‎. I‎- ‎- you don't think he'd come here to the‎.‎.‎. what was that‎? ‎- Was that upstairs‎? ‎- No‎. ‎- Yeah‎, I think it was upstairs‎. Probably‎.‎.‎. ‎- no‎, it came from right over here‎. What did you do‎? Felix‎, what is wrong with you‎? I told you that was expensive‎. Why would you do something like that‎? Are you gonna help me clean it up‎? Felix‎! ‎- Just trying to help‎. The answer is "b‎." ‎- Are you insane‎? ‎- I need the report card‎. ‎- Do you not see that I'm in the middle of a test right now‎? Just get it at lunch‎. ‎- Hey‎, hey‎. My mom's been on my ass all week‎. I need it now‎. ‎- You're killing me‎. ‎- Yeah‎, buddy‎. Thank you‎. Hey‎, seriously‎, the answer is "b‎." ‎- Seriously‎, shut up‎. ‎- It is‎. I can see emily's test‎. Hi‎. ‎- Are you serious‎? ‎- "Are you serious‎?" ‎- Any word when we can expect to see your report card‎? ‎- You mean‎.‎.‎. This one right here‎? ‎- Is that it‎? ‎- Yep‎, got it in the mail this morning‎. ‎- Why didn't you tell us it came‎? ‎- How do you think you did‎? ‎- I think I did okay‎. ‎- Oh‎, my god‎! ‎- Straight "a" s‎.‎.‎. The holy grail of academia‎. Every parent wants to see their kid succeed‎. They also want the bragging rights at christmas parties‎. They want the honor roll bumper sticker on the back of their minivan‎. "A" s are like a reward for properly raising your kid‎. It's like catnip for parents‎. Wow‎, felix‎! This is‎.‎.‎. ‎- wow‎! ‎- I can't believe it‎. You even got an "a" in mr‎. Harris' class‎. ‎- What‎, you didn't think I'd be able to handle chemistry‎? ‎- No‎, no‎, no‎, we just got a call from him a couple of weeks ago about a parent‎-teacher conference‎. I was worried there was a problem‎, but apparently not‎. ‎- No‎. ‎- You guys aren't actually going to that‎, right‎? ‎- Well‎, your dad can't make it because he has a real job‎, but I already said yes‎. We're supposed to meet with him on saturday‎. ‎- But there's really no reason to‎. I have an "a" in his class‎. ‎- I already told him we were going‎, felix‎. ‎- Okay‎, you could just cancel it‎. ‎- Is everything okay‎? ‎- Is there‎.‎.‎. Something we should know about‎? ‎- No‎. No‎. I just don't want you to feel like you have to go‎. ‎- We're going‎. ‎- Great‎. ‎- Terrible‎. That's terrible‎. ‎- Is unreal how mr‎. Harris always manages to ruin everything‎. ‎- So I guess you got to tell your parents the truth‎. ‎- Absolutely not‎. I'm gonna fake a parent‎-teacher conference‎. ‎- Well‎, that sounds difficult/impossible‎. ‎- Mm‎, difficult‎, yes‎. Impossible‎.‎.‎. Probably also yes‎, but that's never stopped us before‎. We're going to need a shady middle‎-aged man‎. ‎- Why‎? ‎- To act as mr‎. Harris during the conference‎. Do you ever just stand back sometimes and look at your plan and think to yourself‎, "wow‎, I am dumb"‎? ‎- Why do you got to be like this‎? ‎- Maybe it's because I'm sick of nearly getting arrested every time that I help you‎. ‎- Who says I'm asking for your help‎? ‎- You are always asking for my help‎. ‎- False‎. I don't need it‎. ‎- I got this‎. ‎- Good‎.‎.‎. 'Cause I would say no‎. ‎- Why‎? ‎- Because‎.‎.‎. I'm sick of your sketchy plans‎. I help you because you're my friend‎, but I cannot keep doing this stuff‎. ‎- No‎. It's cool‎. I'll just handle it myself‎. ‎- Good luck‎. ‎- Danny isn't wrong‎. I'm not going to contest what he said‎. Guess I'm going to have to pull this off by myself‎. ‎- Shamus‎. How's it going‎, man‎? Remember me‎? Oh‎, come on‎, shamus‎, it's felix‎! I gave you two packs of gum last week‎. Hey‎. I have a proposition for you‎. Are you interested‎? ‎- Let me put on some pants‎. So you expect me to dress like a teacher‎? ‎- Yeah‎, we just need to convince my mom that you're mr‎. Harris for five minutes‎. ‎- You going to pay me‎? ‎- I don't have much money‎. ‎- What do you got‎? ‎- Um‎, 40 bucks‎. ‎- What else you got‎? ‎- Um‎.‎.‎. A crossbow‎. ‎- 40 bucks and a crossbow‎.‎.‎. you got yourself a deal‎. ‎- Cool‎, cool‎. Just make sure you wear something nice‎. ‎- "Something nice"‎? ‎- Yeah‎, like a collared shirt or something‎. Do I look like the sort of fellow who owns a collared shirt‎? ‎- Let's do this‎.‎.‎. meet me at my house tomorrow morning‎.‎.‎. And I'll let you borrow some of my dad's clothes‎. ‎- All right‎. ‎- Okay‎? ‎- All right‎. ‎- Cool‎. ‎- So you want me to act like mr‎. Harris‎. Think I can pull it off‎? ‎- Yeah‎. ‎- Why‎? Why‎? ‎- What's the problem‎? ‎- What happened with being as quiet as a rodent‎? ‎- I was balls deep in rodent quietness until I found these horseshoes‎, and I was faced with a very difficult decision‎. What‎? I'm failing to see the difficulty here‎. ‎- It was horseshoes versus quietness‎. ‎- Are you trying to get caught by mom and dad‎? ‎- No‎, okay‎? Look‎, I didn't go through the trouble of escaping the mountain academy just so I could be bored out of my frickin' mind here in the attic‎. ‎- Yeah‎, yeah‎, yeah‎, out of everything you could've done‎, all this‎, you decide to throw horseshoes‎? ‎- Yes‎. What do you do in your free time‎, felix‎? ‎- It's complicated‎. You wouldn't believe me if I told you‎, but‎.‎.‎. ‎- Try me‎. ‎- I just bribed a janitor with a crossbow to fake a parent‎-teacher conference‎. ‎- That sounds amazing‎. Let me help you‎. ‎- No‎. ‎- I would be an absolute asset to your team‎. I'm professional‎. And how do you know your plan doesn't need me‎? ‎- Because my plan doesn't involve getting screwed and going back to jail‎. ‎- Okay‎, at least‎.‎.‎. at the very least‎, tell me what you're doing‎. ‎- Well‎, first I'm going to need pizza‎. ‎- Okay‎, why pizza‎? ‎- Because I'm‎.‎.‎. ‎- Stop‎. I know why pizza‎.‎.‎. because you're going to put ex‎-lax on the pizza‎, give it to the teacher‎. He's going to have diarrhea and not going to be able to show up to the meeting‎. ‎- What‎? No‎, I‎.‎.‎. ‎- You're going to do the "imposter pizza delivery guy" switch‎, aren't you‎? ‎- Ben‎. I'm getting pizza because I'm hungry‎. ‎- Oh‎. ‎- Where have you been‎? My mom's going to be here any minute‎. ‎- You said be here at 9:00‎. ‎- That was an hour ago‎. ‎- Oh‎. Huh‎. ‎- You know how to tie a tie‎, right‎? ‎- Well‎, I'll figure something out‎. ‎- Remember‎, I need you in room 34‎.‎.‎. crap‎. ‎- What‎? What‎? ‎- Come on‎, get inside‎. ‎- What‎? What‎? ‎- My mom's here‎. Get inside‎. ‎- Ooh‎. ‎- Get inside‎. Upstairs‎, come on‎. No‎, no‎. ‎- Felix‎? ‎- Yeah‎? ‎- What's going on‎? What was that‎? ‎- W‎-what was what‎? ‎- Never mind‎. Remember‎, we have to leave for that meeting soon‎. ‎- Okay‎. ‎- Honey‎? What's going on up there‎? ‎- Uh‎, n‎-nothing‎, I just tripped‎. ‎- You ready to leave soon‎? ‎- Yep‎, sounds good‎. What the hell did you do‎? Who is that‎? ‎- It's shamus‎. ‎- Who is shamus‎? ‎- He's my one hope at faking this conference‎. ‎- Seriously‎? That‎? ‎- Yes‎. You screwed this whole thing up‎, man‎. What did you do‎? ‎- I don't know‎, man‎. When I see bearded people in my attic‎, I go buck wild‎. ‎- Oh‎, you go buck wild‎, yeah‎? ‎- Yeah‎. ‎- Shamus‎, shamus‎, wake up‎. ‎- Oh‎, man‎. ‎- Shamus‎, wake up‎. Shamus‎, wake up‎, buddy‎! Wake up‎. The conference is in 20 minutes‎. ‎- Just tell mom he didn't show up‎. ‎- No‎. The real mr‎. Harris is going to be there‎. ‎- Felix‎, are you ready‎, honey‎? ‎- I got you‎, man‎. ‎- No‎. Absolutely not‎. Stay here‎. ‎- Trust me‎, dude‎, I got you‎. ‎- No‎. ‎- Yes‎. ‎- Felix‎, let's go‎! ‎- Be right there‎! No‎! ‎- Oh‎, there you are‎, honey‎. Come on‎. I don't want to be late‎. A little anxious about this meeting‎. I don't know what to expect‎. ‎- I know exactly how you feel‎. ‎- Boom town‎. Target acquired‎. ‎- Yeah‎, unfortunately‎, I'm not gonna be available till late this afternoon‎. You got it‎. ‎- Mrs‎. Anders‎, you're not due here until 12:00 noon‎. ‎- Oh‎, mrs‎. O'neil‎. I'm felix's mom‎. ‎- Felix's mom‎? Felix‎.‎.‎. What's going on here‎? ‎- Ooh‎, were we scheduled later‎? ‎- No‎, no‎, no‎, no‎. You weren't scheduled at all‎. ‎- I don't understand‎. Oh‎, is this because felix got an "a" in your class‎? That's‎, uh‎.‎.‎. No‎, felix never got an "a" in my class‎. Felix never even passed my class‎. ‎- Are you sure you're thinking of the right student‎? ‎- Oh‎, I'm positive‎. ‎- Felix‎, would you like to explain this‎? ‎- Mrs‎. O'neil‎, you're aware that your son‎.‎.‎. No longer attends my class‎, right‎? Yeah‎, felix‎.‎.‎. ‎- oh‎, my god‎. Mr‎. Harris‎? Mr‎. Harris‎, are you okay‎? ‎- This is perfectly normal‎. ‎- How is this normal‎? ‎- He's narcoleptic or something‎. ‎- Oh‎. I'm calling an ambulance‎. ‎- No‎, mom‎, he's fine‎. ‎- Yes‎, a teacher just‎.‎.‎. ‎- He's okay‎, he really is‎. ‎- Had a stroke or something‎. ‎- Trust me‎. ‎- I don't know‎. We need medical help‎. ‎- Mom‎, we don't need help‎. We got it‎. ‎- Eastwood high school‎. ‎- We got this‎. ‎- Please hurry‎. ‎- He does this all the time‎. ‎- I'll wait outside‎. ‎- No‎, wait‎, mom‎. Mom‎, chill‎, chill‎, chill‎, chill‎. ‎- Oh‎, my god‎. Ben‎? What is going on here‎? Ben‎, what's wrong‎? ‎- I tried‎. He just‎.‎.‎. felix‎.‎.‎. ‎- oh‎, my god‎, what is wrong with him‎? ‎- Honey‎? ‎- I don't want montana‎. ‎- Oh‎. Wait a minute‎. W‎-what the hell is he doing here‎? ‎- I don't know‎. He‎.‎.‎. why would he be here‎? ‎- Don't you dare lie to me‎. I want answers‎. You failed mr‎. Harris' class‎, didn't you‎? ‎- No‎, I didn't‎.‎.‎. ‎- you faked your grades‎? ‎- What‎? ‎- I am gonna talk to mr‎. Truman about this immediately‎. ‎- He's not here‎. It's the weekend‎. ‎- Well‎, then I plan on meeting with him first thing monday morning‎. And when we get home‎, you go to your room‎, because you are grounded‎.‎.‎. Indefinitely‎. ‎- Well‎, at least no one got arrested‎. Luckily‎, ben used the right amount of sedative‎. Mr‎. Harris was taken to the hospital and woke up a few hours later with short‎-term amnesia‎. Shamus regained consciousness and left the house before we returned‎. He made sure to raid our pantry first‎. ‎- You've reached the office of principal truman‎. Please leave a message after the beep‎. ‎- Hi‎, mr‎. Truman‎, this is julie o'neil‎.‎.‎. ‎- This happens to be the third voice mail my mom has left for mr‎. Truman‎. ‎- I'm sorry to call again‎.‎.‎. ‎- Hoping she doesn't get through anytime soon‎. ‎- Concerned about my son‎.‎.‎. ‎- Ben‎. Ben tried to take the blame for the whole thing‎. Mom wasn't sure what to believe‎. Regardless‎, he was sent back to the mountain academy‎, or‎, as he calls it‎, "project butthole‎." He told me he's already planned his next escape‎. As for me‎, the vacation's over‎. I may not want to spend my life at a desk job‎, but I sure as hell don't want to spend it in jail either‎. ‎- Hey‎, let's do something fun‎. ‎- I can't‎. I'm grounded‎. ‎- I have pizza‎. ‎- Hey‎. ‎- Hi‎. So what did they ground you for‎? ‎- It's‎.‎.‎. Hard to explain‎. ‎- Well‎, other than that‎, how are you doing‎? ‎- Well‎.‎.‎. My parents are on the verge of finding out I've been expelled‎, so‎.‎.‎. ‎- Okay‎, wait‎. ‎- They don't know‎? ‎- No‎. They are gonna flip when they find out‎. ‎- Yeah‎, that could be a problem‎. ‎- I just‎.‎.‎. I just want to turn things around‎. I think I really messed up this time‎. I‎.‎.‎. I want to do the right thing‎, but I'm not‎.‎.‎. I'm not entirely sure what that is‎. I can't keep lying to my parents‎. ‎- Well‎, maybe you don't have to lie to them at all‎. ‎- Huh‎? What do you mean by that‎? I think I've broken into eastwood enough times this week‎. ‎- We're not breaking in‎, silly‎. Come on‎. ‎- This is crazy‎. You can almost see the whole campus from here‎. ‎- I know‎. It's awesome‎, right‎? ‎- Yeah‎, it is‎. So many good memories here‎. ‎- Yeah‎. ‎- I'm going to miss it‎. Montana's gonna suck‎. ‎- Come on‎, don't say that‎. There's a way out of this‎. ‎- My mom's not gonna stop until she finds the truth‎. ‎- Well‎.‎.‎. If you could get truman to re‎-enroll you‎, you will not have to lie to your mom at all‎. You'd actually be going to eastwood‎. ‎- I'm not exactly in the position to get truman to do anything for me‎. ‎- Then I guess you're going to have to get him to see things your way‎. ‎- Do you know something I don't‎? ‎- Possibly‎. ‎- What‎? ‎- Well‎, you know that pizza place I work for‎? ‎- Yeah‎. ‎- We deliver 24 hours a day‎. ‎- So‎? ‎- So‎.‎.‎. That means‎.‎.‎. Wait for it‎. Now‎. ‎- I don't get it‎. ‎- Whoa‎. Is that mr‎. Truman‎? ‎- Yeah‎. ‎- What is he doing‎? ‎- I don't know‎. He orders a barbecue‎-chicken pizza every saturday night‎. ‎- Why‎? ‎- No idea‎. Want to find out‎? What do you think he's looking at‎? ‎- I don't know‎. What time is it‎? It's 11:00‎. What is he doing here so late‎? ‎- Shady stuff‎. I wish we could see his screen‎. ‎- I think that can be arranged‎. ‎- Oh‎. ‎- what are you doing here‎? ‎- I'm sorry‎. ‎- I know‎. ‎- I really mean that‎. ‎- I know‎. ‎- Asking you to risk your neck for me all the time is pretty selfish‎. I just want you to know that if it was you who needed me to do some shady stuff‎, I would do it in an instant‎. ‎- Well‎, I was planning on stealing the declaration of independence‎. ‎- I brought you a burrito‎. ‎- Yeah‎, okay‎, I forgive you‎. Who's that‎? ‎- Oh‎, that's katie‎. ‎- Hi‎. ‎- Hi‎. You really think there's something shady on here‎? ‎- Absolutely‎. There's‎.‎.‎. there's got to be‎. ‎- So you recorded this from truman's computer‎? ‎- Yeah‎. What time did you see him log on‎? Around 11:00‎. ‎- Wait‎. How far back does this go‎? ‎- I mean‎, technically‎, we can go all the way back to the point where we bugged his computer‎. I got everything on the hard drive‎, so‎.‎.‎. ‎- Wait‎, wait‎, look‎. He plays online blackjack‎? But why would he do this in the middle of the night at school‎? ‎- I mean‎.‎.‎. he must be hiding it from someone‎. ‎- His wife‎, probably‎. ‎- Whoa‎, look at this‎. He just lost $600 right there‎. ‎- Oh‎.‎.‎. ‎- I'd say he definitely has a problem‎. ‎- Oh‎, wow‎. ‎- No‎, this is insane‎. He just lost another grand‎. ‎- Wow‎! He sucks‎. I mean‎, he's got to give up at some point‎, right‎? I mean‎, this is crazy‎. ‎- Maybe his wife might want to see this‎. Yeah‎. What's he doing‎? Is he quitting‎? ‎- I don't know‎. ‎- Does that‎.‎.‎.‎? Does that say "eastwood"‎? ‎- Wait‎. Did he just‎.‎.‎. ‎- he just stole money from the school‎. ‎- Dude‎, that is‎, like‎, serious jail time right there‎. This is huge‎. ‎- Wait‎. So we just recorded‎.‎.‎. ‎- we just recorded blackmail jackpot‎. ‎- Dude‎, I can't believe this‎. He must be out of his mind‎. ‎- Does this mean we can get truman to re‎-enroll you‎? ‎- This means we can get truman to do anything‎. ‎- Yes‎. Yes‎! ‎- Ooh‎, tell him to come alone‎. ‎- But who would he bring‎? ‎- Just do it‎. It's creepy‎. ‎- Oh‎, also tell him he's a douche‎. ‎- Why‎? ‎- 'Cause he's a douche‎. ‎- You going to bed soon‎? Felix‎. ‎- Sorry‎. Yeah‎, I'm going to pass out in a bit‎. ‎- Okay‎, just checking in on you‎. Get some sleep‎. ‎- Good night‎, dad‎. Gary‎. Nice car‎. ‎- Are you really this stupid‎? How many times do I need to have you arrested this week‎? ‎- Oh‎, you're going to call the cops‎? If you are‎, then great‎. I'd love to tell them about the $10‎,000 you stole from the school to fund your gambling addiction‎. Yeah‎. ‎- It's your word against mine‎. Who do you think they're gonna side with‎, anyway‎? ‎- I bugged your laptop‎, gary‎. I have hard evidence of all your activity on my hard drive‎. And‎, frankly‎, I don't think they're going to have trouble picking sides‎. ‎- What is this‎? Do you want money‎? What do you want‎? ‎- Enrollment‎. ‎- "Enrollment"‎? ‎- I want enrollment in the next semester at eastwood‎. And I want the forms filled out by monday‎. ‎- That's ridiculous‎. ‎- Gary‎. These last few days have been hell for me‎. But I know there's still a chance for me to set things straight‎. ‎- W‎-what are you talking about‎? ‎- You once asked me‎, "what kind of future do you see for yourself"‎? I thought about it‎.‎.‎. A lot‎. And my future is here at eastwood‎. ‎- No‎, that's not gonna happen‎, felix‎. The faculty won't approve it‎. ‎- I think you'll find the way‎. ‎- Oh‎, really‎? Why is that‎? ‎- 'Cause you don't want to go to jail‎, gary‎. ‎- You're not listening‎. I need those forms authorized by tomorrow morning‎. You understand‎? Hold on a second‎. Come on in‎, come on in‎. Hi‎. I need you to search for form a‎-13‎. It's the enrollment form‎, okay‎? ‎- Yeah‎, of course‎. Get right on it‎. ‎- Great‎. Great‎. ‎- Yeah‎, I've got my t‎.A‎. Working on it right now‎, uh‎-huh‎. ‎- Felix‎! What in the‎.‎.‎. ‎- danny‎! ‎- No‎, no‎, no‎! ‎- Ow‎! Ow‎! ‎- Chill‎. ‎- I hate you‎. I hate you‎.‎.‎. But I respect you‎. Oh‎. Okay‎. Ah‎. Wait‎, so‎.‎.‎. okay‎, so how did last night with truman go‎? ‎- Is he gonna enroll you‎? ‎- Uh‎.‎.‎. He didn't exactly say yes‎, but he didn't say no either‎, so‎.‎.‎. ‎- Maybe you need to threaten him a little more‎. ‎- What is this‎? Uh‎, an enrollment form‎. ‎- For felix‎? ‎- Yes‎. ‎- Why‎? ‎- It's‎.‎.‎. It's not so easy to explain‎. ‎- You can't do this‎. ‎- He's got me in a really bad spot‎, vanessa‎. ‎- What is it‎.‎.‎. blackmail‎? Don't even‎.‎.‎. don't even say anything‎. You don't have to say anything‎. ‎- I‎-I really don't have a choice here‎. ‎- Mr‎. Truman‎, yes‎, you do‎. I can help you‎. ‎- "If my demands aren't met‎, "then I will be forced to turn the hard drive directly over to the police‎." ‎- How was that‎? ‎- Perfect‎. ‎- Pounds all around‎. ‎- Amazing‎. ‎- You guys want to get burritos‎? I'm starving‎. ‎- Yeah‎. ‎- Aren't you grounded‎? ‎- That is what this guy is here for‎. ‎- Oh‎, don't‎. ‎- Hello‎. ‎- Mr‎. Truman‎? ‎- Yes‎. ‎- Oh‎, my god‎, I've been trying to reach you all weekend‎. This is julie‎, felix's mom‎. We need to talk‎. ‎- Yes‎, we do‎. ‎- Oh‎, that burrito was fantastic‎. However‎, I am going to need to use your bathroom and a scented candle‎. Whoa‎. ‎- Where's the hard drive‎? ‎- I put it in that drawer‎. ‎- Please tell me you made a copy of that video‎. ‎- What video‎? ‎- The truman video‎. And‎, no‎, I did not make a copy‎. Wait‎. No‎. There is technically still one more copy‎. ‎- So you made a copy‎. ‎- Truman's computer‎.‎.‎. there's still a hard copy on his laptop‎. ‎- Let's go‎. Vanessa‎.‎.‎. Funny seeing you here‎. Did truman put you up to this‎? ‎- What are you talking about‎? ‎- The drive‎.‎.‎. give it back‎. ‎- Blackmailing the dean of students‎? What happened to you‎, felix‎? ‎- Not that it's any of your business‎, but I'm not doing it for the money‎. ‎- I don't care‎. You're not coming back to eastwood‎. ‎- Is that the only way for you to succeed‎, is to watch me fail‎? ‎- You're a cheater‎, felix‎. Everyone else is just too stupid to see it‎, even your parents‎. It's all fake‎, just like your report card‎. When are you gonna put in the work and actually try to play by the rules‎? ‎- Why do you think I'm trying to come back to eastwood‎? ‎- Probably just to spite me‎. ‎- I just need another chance‎. And I'm willing to put in the work‎. I will‎. I want to‎. Don't you think I deserve one more chance‎? Where's the drive‎, vanessa‎? ‎- I told you I don't have it‎. Didn't you make a backup‎? ‎- I need that drive‎. ‎- It's in his bottom desk drawer‎. I'm sure if you run‎, you can get it before he wipes it‎. ‎- Welcome back‎, felix‎. ‎- It's good to be back‎, gary‎. ‎- I finished your enrollment forms‎. Shame you won't be needing them‎. Oh‎, and‎, uh‎, I wiped everything off of your drive‎. ‎- What about our deal‎? ‎- Looks like our deal is off‎. Your mom is on her way‎. So are the police‎. I beat you‎, felix‎. Oh‎, my god‎. ‎- Oh‎, and I‎-I wouldn't worry about bringing any of this up to the police‎. I've tied up all loose ends‎. ‎- So you wiped the laptop‎. ‎- Laptop‎? ‎- all the evidence I need is‎, uh‎.‎.‎. On that laptop‎. ‎- Stop‎! ‎- You‎, uh‎.‎.‎. Might want to tape these back together‎. ‎- Felix‎? ‎- Hi‎, mom‎. ‎- Is he in trouble‎? ‎- Uh‎.‎.‎. "Trouble"‎? No‎, no trouble‎. ‎- Okay‎. What‎.‎.‎. what is going on‎? Why are the police here‎? ‎- Oh‎, why are the police here‎, mr‎. Truman‎? ‎- Um‎, that's kind of‎.‎.‎. Hard to explain‎. You know‎, maybe we should meet at another time‎, mrs‎. O'neil‎. ‎- Mr‎. Truman‎, I have gone to great lengths to meet with you‎, uh‎, and to be frank‎, I am kind of fed up with this whole situation‎. I need to know what's going on right now‎. His report card‎.‎.‎. It's faked‎. Right‎? ‎- Mm‎, mm‎, mm‎. No‎, no‎. This‎.‎.‎. this looks right to me‎. ‎- What‎? Felix has been doing‎.‎.‎. Remarkably well here at eastwood‎. ‎- Really‎? ‎- And he's‎.‎.‎. he's been participating in many‎.‎.‎. Extracurricular activities‎. ‎- Like the school play‎, right‎? ‎- Oh‎, the school play‎.‎.‎. he was just wonderful at the school play‎. ‎- truman signed the papers‎, and three days later‎, I was officially re‎-enrolled here at eastwood high‎.‎.‎. With a few extra benefits‎. ‎- Can we make this a duet‎? ‎- There's not enough room‎. ‎- You sure about that‎? ‎- Needless to say‎, looks like this is gonna be my best year yet‎. ‎- Oh‎, sorry‎. Hey‎. Stop stalking me‎. ‎- You're ridiculous‎. ‎- See you around‎.‎.‎. If you're lucky‎. The shortest definition of a game is as follows‎.‎.‎. a competitive activity with a fixed set of rules‎. There's a point system‎. There are winners‎. There are losers‎. There are allies‎.‎.‎. And opponents‎. High school is a game‎. And I'm finally here to play‎. ‎- ¶ Tell me how ¶ ¶ tell me how we both got here ¶ ¶ we kiss 'em now ¶ ¶ love is in the atmosphere ¶ ¶ and I don't want to lose you ¶ ¶ it feels like I've waited forever ¶ ¶ don't know what I'm doing ¶ ¶ but it's all right ¶ ¶ yeah‎, it's all right ¶ ¶ so please don't leave me here tonight ¶ ¶ lonely on the dance floor ¶ ¶ 'cause I've been waiting my whole life ¶ ¶ for a moment like this ¶ ¶ so please don't leave me here tonight ¶ ¶ lonely on the dance floor ¶ ¶ 'cause I've been waiting my whole life ¶ ¶ for a moment like this ¶ ¶ shake you off ¶ ¶ I can't seem to shake you off ¶ ¶ tonight ¶ ¶ your broken heart ¶ ¶ let me fix your broken heart ¶ ¶ tonight ¶ ¶ so‎, if love's what you're needing ¶ ¶ then love is what you're getting‎, baby ¶ ¶ I can't believe it ¶ ¶ that I'm here with you ¶ ¶ yeah‎, I'm here with you ¶ ¶ so please don't leave me here tonight ¶ ¶ lonely on the dance floor ¶ ¶ 'cause I've been waiting my whole life ¶ ¶ for a moment like this ¶ ¶ so please don't leave me here tonight ¶ ¶ lonely on the dance floor ¶ ¶ 'cause I've been waiting my whole life‎.‎.‎. ¶ Support us and become VIP member to remove all ads from OpenSubtitles‎.org
