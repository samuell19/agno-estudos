Good morning, sweetheart! Paul has a class test today. But he's still sleeping. How dare he! We'll set him straight. Come on! Watch what I'll do to him. Hey, Paul! Hey! Wake up! You have an exam today, right? I know enough to pass the exam. Let's study for ten more marks then. Come on! Hey! Started, huh? Good. Sheesh! Geeta tai, [in Hindi] poha again? Why don't you learn to make puttu and kadala from Papa? -Okay. -[in Malayalam] Please teach her. Okay, sir. Please adjust today. Okay. You're leaving already? Yeah. I have to sort out some packaging issues. -It's a mess. -When did you come home last night? -I didn't know. -My flight got delayed. I reached around 2:30 a.m. -Then why don't you go later? -No, I must go! And, Sandeep, can you go through this proposal? I think it needs some fine-tuning. Okay. I'll check. Bye. -Hey! Have some food! -No. This is enough. I'll be late. Mumma! Annie, I've booked tickets for a movie in the evening. You'll come, right? Hey! Hey! I'll be there. Hey! Hello! I'll reach there before you guys. Just text me the place and time. -Okay. -Bye, Mumma. -Bye, sweetheart. -Bye, Mumma. -Bye. -Okay. -Bye. -Okay. Good morning. How can I help you? Hey. This is a statement I prepared for you, Jerry. Can you please check it? Okay. I'll check it. -Good morning, ma'am. -Morning. -Good morning, ma'am. -Good morning. [in Tamil] She's such a hot item, man! Yeah, dude. "How men should behave with their lady colleagues" Office circular. [in Tamil] Read this properly. Don't hesitate to ask me if you have any doubts. Okay, dude? [in Malayalam] Shall I go? There will be a slight sting. -Oh, no! -It's fine. Hey! Why didn't you run away? What a question! I did run, ma'am. I ran all around that auditorium. After all that running, I ended up in front of... that girl's father. -And that guy is a Hulk! -Great. -Congrats. -Thanks. -Doctor... -Thank you. Brother... Yes. It's a girl! Yeah, it was a normal delivery. At 4:10 p.m. The star sign is Aswathy. Yes. Oh, no. An injection? You should learn your lesson at least now. Quit this scam job and try to find work with decent people. This has been happening for quite some time now. We have to be more efficient about the delivery process. We cannot afford such complaints. Vimal, what's happening with the print campaign? The agency is working on it, ma'am. They will say that, Vimal. I'm sure they haven't even started yet. Nidhi, fix a meeting with them tomorrow. If they can't deliver on time, we'll look for other options. Yes, ma'am. I'll follow up. Yeah. Before we watch 6 Underground, we should watch How To Train Your Dragon. Hey, guys! Listen up! Listen up! -The birthday boy will sing for us. -No, guys! -How will I sing now? -Come on! Which song do I sing? -Sing, sing. -Okay, fine. [singing "Surangani"] Hi... Hi. Cheers. Sir... Sorry. Thank you, sir. -Sir, this? -Hey, Sunny! We've known each other ever since you were running a travel agency. -Right? -Yes. I entrusted you to handle my daughter's wedding for that reason alone, even though I could have approached any big event company. That was my mistake. I was the one who got humiliated in front of so many guests. Anyway, almost all the big shots of Kerala were present there. You're not going to get any work from them hereafter. I'll do the needful from my side as well. Sir, please don't do that. It wasn't deliberate. Since I owe huge amounts to different people, they have started attacking me now. I can't hold on anymore. You shouldn't. My daughter hasn't spoken a word to me after the wedding. So, if you come here again, asking for the balance amount, I'll chop off your legs! Do you have any doubt, Sunny? No. FLORIST IDIOT Are you busy? Yes, a little bit. Are you at home? -Yes. -Hey, Sunny! This is your papa. I know, Papa. Isn't Sophie with you? She's in the other room. Oh! When will you both reach tomorrow? What's happening tomorrow? What is tomorrow's date? Oh, yeah! I remember. You just asked me what's happening tomorrow. I meant that... I'll be there tomorrow. Everyone else will reach tomorrow evening. I... We will also come tomorrow. Okay then. Carry on. -See you tomorrow. -Okay. Oh, no! What happened? -They broke my arm. -Oh, no. Good that it's your left arm. What if it was my right arm? You'd have been screwed. Oh, my God! Marvellous! So, you're also in their team, Mumma? Stop there! Don't run! Don't run. You'll fall. Bye. -Bye, Mumma. -Bye. -Bye, Mumma! -Kisses! Be careful. Okay, Mumma! Kids, his snoring is just unbearable. Do you believe me now? Listen to it. Loud and clear! ...to get their approval. And I've handed over everything to Vimal and Nidhi. If you have any kind of doubts, you can call them anytime. Just a minute. Have you worked with music composer Raveendran Master? Yes. There was an unreleased film for which he composed music. Nakshatrame Moonnaksharam. I've played the violin for that movie. It was a great... Recognise him? Now I'll have to sit through stories of recording sessions with this composer friend, and all his bragging about his Madras life. I'll be exhausted by then. Wow! It tastes so good! If I have to bring you guys here, I'll have to lure you with such psychological tactics. Brother, can I get mutton curry somewhere nearby? Mutton? Here? It's okay. Forget it. Annie, you didn't see her... when you came last week, right? This is Linda. Isn't she beautiful? She's the one who gives me company here now. She takes me all around this place. Thank you. Annie Ma! Hi! -Kiddo! -Annie Ma! Hey, Simy! Hi, Annie! You could've told me if you had such a plan. So what? I thought I'll get this introduction session over with. But I could have been prepared. That's not necessary. It's easy for you to say that. -Hey! My darlings! -Here's your uncle. I hope you understand. I totally understand. Come. Hi. How are you? I'm fine. How are you? Good, good. Why don't we book a room, freshen up and leave after that? Yeah, sounds good. -Shall we go? -Let's go. They seem so innocent while they are asleep. But once they are awake, they bring the roof down. One. Two. Three. Four. One. Two... Three... Four... One... Two... Three... Four... Not bad, but you need a little more practice. -I'll let you know about the next class. -Okay. So, I wish you all a happy Christmas. -Happy Christmas, sir! -Merry Christmas! -Happy new year! -Happy new year! -Joel! -Yes. Ask your papa to call me. For the wine, right? I'll tell him. Exactly! Hey, Xavier! Aren't you done yet? Well, where's Sophie? -Sophie... -Didn't she come? Oh! It must be difficult for her to travel now, right? Yes, and she didn't get leave either. I thought everyone will be here. This is so sad. -Yes. So sad! -Come. ♪ Hallelujah, O Jesus! ♪ Jesus! -You've ditched rum for whiskey? -No, not at all. Kiddo brought this when he came last time. -You can take it. -Oh! Does he come here often? He comes all the way from Bangalore once in a while. Work has been too hectic, Papa. That's all right. By the way, you should be taking care of your body. You've got a paunch now. That's right. If someone sees you both together, no one will say that you are father and son. If Uncle dyes his hair, you'll look like brothers. Where were you? I was the one on the ladder outside. Which ladder? Who was it then? Hey, Lisy! Papa, is there anything I have to do for tomorrow? Oh! They are here! -Hi! -How are you, my little angels? We're good. How're you doing, Grandpa? -I'm great. -How are you doing, Grandpa? -I'm doing great. -Okay, Vimal. I'll call you. The children have started speaking Malayalam, huh? -Yes, yes. I've trained them well. -Very good. -Are you sure? -Don't worry. Just come. Papa! How are you? Fine. Very fine. What is this, Papa? -Have you brought booze? -Yes. I'll take that suitcase then. How're you doing, Mr. Das? It's been so long! Stop it. Papa, this is my... friend. -Hello. -Welcome, dear. What's your name? Simy. What's up, Bombay Lady? I'm doing good, Mr. Kochi! You're greying, huh? It greys faster when you use your brain at work. Then your hair should be jet black. Get lost! -Hi, sis. -Hi, Lisy. Brother-in-law! -How are you? -Great. Sunny, I'm your only brother-in-law. Can't you call at least once in a while to check on me? The younger ones are supposed to call the elders to check on them. You always hang up saying you'll call back in 5 minutes. And have I ever called back? No, right? You haven't changed at all. Just a minute. Yes, brother. Come on, Kiddo. This is Simy, my girlfriend. -Hello. -Hello. Rukku, dear... Come. Kids will recognise you only if you meet them once in a while. That's your Uncle Sunny! Come. All of you, come inside. Come, son. I'm going to Grandpa's room! I'm coming with you! -Where are you going? -Slow down! Hey! Will Jerry be sleeping in Sunny's room? Oops! I'll be right back. Hi. Is the room okay, Simy? Yeah. Very nice. Good. What is it? Go, get freshened up. I will. Which room will you be staying in? This room. This room? Yes. Hey. Papa... With Lisy around, it wouldn't look nice. My dear Annie, I will sleep in the verandah. Is it okay if I use the bathroom in this room? Get lost! Are you leaving already? We have to go there. Why didn't you ask anything, Papa? To whom? What should I ask? Is that how it is? What's the matter? Tell me clearly. The girl who has come with Kiddo? -Yes. -That's the matter. Why didn't you ask anything more to him? How can you let him bring anyone home? When Annie and you brought your partners home, we welcomed them, right? Aren't you his elder brother? Why don't you ask him? Well, I thought... I should respect your age. Why are you talking like an old-fashioned man? All this is very common now, right? Papa, I don't care even if he brings a guy home. But he could have told all of us earlier. Sunny seems to be really serious. What's the matter? The girl who came with Kiddo, Simy, he was talking about her. They have been in love for a while now. This time he's serious, Papa. He brought her along to introduce her to the family. So, you already know, madam? He tells me everything. She is really caring. She keeps him under control too. I think she can bring some positive changes to his otherwise reckless life. You should have asked. Didn't feel the need to. -Who do you think-- -Annie! Okay, okay. Carry on. Is he old enough to get married, Papa? It's good to get married early. He will have a sense of responsibility. Since she is 3-4 years older, she might show more maturity. 4 years older? She's 4 years older than him, Papa! They are comfortable with each other, Papa. Isn't that most important? And if they have our support as well, they will live happily. That's all I cared about. So, everything has been finalised? You didn't tell me. That's fine. Nobody respects me anyway. At least, you guys should have informed Papa. Papa is fine with it. Are you the one to decide that? Yes. I will decide that for now. Keep this CEO attitude in your office. Don't take it out here. They are in love. Accept it if you can. If you can't, go and ask him directly. There's no point shouting at me instead. Hey, just calm down. Do we need these fights and arguments now? If Mary was alive, she would have welcomed her happily. -Papa, I-- -I forgot to say one thing. Simy is a divorcee. She doesn't have children. Marvellous! Then, it's completely fine. You're sitting here? Everyone else is over there. Come, let's go there. You don't have to act so meek in front of them. Meek? Me? When? They're all lovely people, Jerry. You've seen how my family is, right? Aunt Lisy, will you prepare puttu and kadala tomorrow? -Why not? -Why are you so obsessed with puttu? Rukmini, what are you doing? They have thrashed you to their heart's content. Now, they won't be back. -Is that so? -Yes! Only the lighting guys are left now. Oh, no! They are yet to come? Of course. Don't take off that bandage soon. Let it be there for the sake of your safety. When are you coming back? I don't know. Let me see what the situation is here. I'll tell you after that. -I'll call you later. -Sunny! Who is it on the phone? Are you flirting with someone without Sophie's knowledge? Shall we pour a small one? What a question! Where's the stuff? Come. Hold this. Do we have to hide so much? Where's the stuff? Pour it. I've started pouring. Oh, Sunny! You were pulling my leg, huh? Cheers! How's it? Nice? Come on, all of you. Let them come when they want to, Papa. Sandeep, if the kids have finished eating, join us for dinner. Yes, they're done. Yes, Nidhi. I'll make the corrections and I'll send the mail by tomorrow morning. Okay. Come. Sit down, dear. Have your food, Papa. Let her serve herself. Everyone's home, right? You could have waited, Sunny. Madam was busy with office work, right, Sandeep? Yes. Come, dear. What's up, Sunny? How's your event management company doing? Is it shut already? All is Well. What? That's the company's name. I'm so busy that I can't even sit at one place. Your clients normally force you to shut every business of yours within six months. That's why I asked. Shall I pour a small one? -Come. -Go and play, dear. Papa, you're still taking violin classes, right? There are very few students now. Everyone is into guitar now. -Is it? -Why don't you come to Mumbai, Papa? Xavier can handle everything here, right? It's not because of that. It's difficult to travel so far from here. You should go, Papa. I think she needs a nanny for the kids there. Get lost. Shall I get you some porridge? -Not interested? -I know that you can't leave this place, Papa. That's why I don't call you. I don't have any problem in coming to Kochi. Kochi is nearby, right? That's right. And, Papa, Annie has an interview and photoshoot for Vanitha magazine in Kochi. Is it? Why didn't you say that? That's not such a big deal, Papa. That's a big deal for parents. Tell me as soon as it is published. I'll bring you the first copy itself. That okay? Grandpa, what's the Wi-Fi password? annie123. a-n-n-i-e-1-2-3. Thank you, Grandpa. Papa, I had asked you to get some tests done. Did you do it? That's pointless, dear. What is this, Papa? Sunny, why can't you come here and take Papa to the hospital? I'm not sitting idle in my office. My business also needs a lot of focus. Just that it's not published in any magazine. Rukku, stop it. Listen to me! Give it to me. I won't give it to you. Give it to me. I said I'll give it after playing for some time. Don't run, brother! Wait! Listen, Sunny! You've been taunting me ever since I reached here. If you have anything to tell me, say it to my face. -Really? -Yes. Then you better stop bossing around. When did I boss around? You can say all that to hide your own complexes. Don't be such a bore! No. Just bear with me for today. That's the only relief. Hey, Kiddo, shut up! -Dad! -What happened, dear? -Rukku, wait. -Look at this, Dad! -What happened, dear? -He's not giving me my tab. Your tab? It's mine as well. I said I'll give it after playing for some time, Dad. Dear... didn't he say that he'll give it after some time? Isn't he your elder brother? Why are you fighting with him? You have many other toys, right? Play with them for the time being. Son, why do you need this tab now? She is your kid sister. Don't hurt her feelings. After you finish playing, you should give it to your brother. Or both of you should play together. Okay? Give it. Rukku... Good boy! Good girl! Sunny, sit down. Just a minute. Wait. I don't think we'll have another chance to sit around this table together like this again. And I don't know how many days I have left to live. Oh, you don't have to be scared, Papa! You will be alive for a long time. God makes sinners live longer, right? As I was saying, you shouldn't be fighting like this. Stay here happily for a few days. A few days? No, we can't, Papa. I'll leave directly from the church tomorrow. The flight is at 6:00 p.m. Before that, I have that interview for Vanitha in Kochi too. I have to leave too. I can't stay away now. I don't have to leave immediately. But what's the point in staying here? I just asked. You can do as you wish. Lovely people, huh? Welcome to my family. Grandma, Uncle Sunny, -Uncle Jerry. -Oh! Look. -Nice. -Show it. Yes. I got the appreciation mail... This was taken before Mom's wedding. Good job, guys! Keep it up! Yeah, okay! My flight is at 6:00 p.m. tomorrow. I'll reach by 8:00 p.m. Send Yadav to the airport. Okay. Why is the delay happening? Yeah, please make sure... My children... Are you all doing fine? I have been having a lot of thoughts lately. I feel my time is up. I'm not scared, okay? I have something to tell my dear children. In the past ten years, how many times have you come home? The last time everyone got together was for Rukmini's first birthday. No. Sunny couldn't come even then. Sophie had come though. Everyone is be busy with their own lives. I know that. But... I have a request. All of you should come home and stay together, at least for one week every year. It doesn't have to be on any particular date. You can all decide a time according to your convenience. You should visit my childhood home, go on a picnic, celebrate one of your birthdays, prepare my famous mutton curry, have fun and create some lovely memories. You shouldn't do it for the sake of it. After your busy schedules, you will also have retired lives. Then, you'd want to... seek the meaning of life. Then you will realise... I don't want to be melodramatic and bore you. Das! Das! Mary! Mary! Mary! Mary! Lisy! Lisy, come quickly! What? What happened? That was your mother's dying wish. Please stay if you can. I won't force you. I think we should stay for a few more days. Don't think about it. We should stay. ♪ The snowfall has the cosiness ♪ ♪ Of her words ♪ ♪ The flame of the lamp ♪ ♪ Has the sheen of her gaze ♪ ♪ The taste lingering in my mouth ♪ Good night, Annie Ma. ♪ Has her loving touch ♪ ♪ As someone adorns time ♪ ♪ With memories ♪ ♪ Still there's something missing ♪ ♪ The lullaby from the heart ♪ ♪ A lullaby as sweet as honey ♪ ♪ A fresh fragrance Touches me gently ♪ ♪ I saw those colours in my eyes ♪ ♪ There's a breeze And the moonlight's nest ♪ ♪ Still there's something missing ♪ ♪ A lullaby from the heart ♪ ♪ A lullaby as sweet as honey ♪ ♪ A lullaby from the heart ♪ ♪ A lullaby as sweet as honey ♪ Good morning. Good morning. Didn't Jerry wake up yet, Simy? No way. He wakes up on time only if there's some urgent work. Or else, he'll be in bed all day. Jerry's roommates always complain about this. The roommates aren't here now, so go wake him up, Simy. -Go. -I wonder if he'll wake up. Will they get married, sis? Let them do what they want. Lisy... Thanks. What for? Well, ever since Mumma left us, you've been taking care of Papa really well. It's my pleasure. Uncle and Aunty have always considered me like their own daughter. This is the duty of a child, right? Rukku! Come! Hey! You had such a high-profile job in merchant navy, a hefty pay cheque, respect... Leaving all that, you're looking after kids and cooking at home? What's wrong with being a homemaker, Xavier? I mean.... living off your wife's salary and confining yourself to the house, is that a life meant for men like us? What will people think? If you won't tell anyone, I'll tell you the truth. I was a cook even on the ship. Really? -Yes, yes. -Wait! Tell me more. -Mr. Thomas, I've spoken to him. -Okay. They are poor people. They'll have a lot of expenses for Christmas. Rajesh, we were born and brought up here. And these guys are outsiders. I'll tell you my decision. You should pay him the entire amount you owe him before Christmas. Okay? Didn't you open your shop during the last strike, Mahesh? Yes, for some time in the afternoon. The glass is really tough, huh? It may withstand some stone-pelting. Rajesh, I'll clear his dues soon. Rajesh! Hi. When did you guys reach? Last evening. We'll be here for a week. -Come home sometime. -Yes. What's he doing with you? I was just giving him directions. I hope you don't mislead him. This is why no scoundrel from our area votes for your party. -What about your father? -All scoundrels, including him. Carry on then, Sandeep. You have to go to church, right? -I'll come. -Okay then! -Bye. -Come, Xavier. If there's any change in what we agreed upon, don't ask him. -Just give me a call. -Okay. It's okay, Rajesh. You don't have to pay. Rajesh is not a freeloader. Good for me. Good morning, Master. Very good morning! You've reached only this far? Better late than never, right? -What he said is right. -What's right? Hop on, Sandeep. I'll drop you. Xavier, you'll come, right? -Good morning, Papa. -Good morning. How was your North Indian tour? I realised that our Kerala is not in India. Yes. What's happening? -Is he doing well? -He's awesome, Papa. He's in great condition. That's why I gave it to him. Hello! Hi. Do you recognise me? Yes! You are an uncle, right? Good girl! Rajesh! [music from Chithram] Annie! Wow! You look really fit! Is it? I've been working out daily after you told me last time. Very good! Did you have tea? Yes. Thank you. Thank you! Bro! Come here, bro. Bro! Stop calling me "bro" first. -Then? -Call me "sir." I should feel like it, right? Sunny, tea for you. Thank you. Simy, this is my childhood friend. He was my classmate too. Rajesh. -Hello. -Hello. This is Simy. Jerry's girl. -Tea for you? -No. I'm good. Okay then. She's from Bangalore. -We shouldn't skip even one of them. -Okay, sir.

Shall we go, Rajesh? Okay. You are a wife and a mother of two children. Along with that, you're running a highly successful business venture. How does your family support you? Sandeep, my husband... He is my pillar of support. He is a dreamer. He was a captain in the merchant navy. He has travelled all around the world. He opted for an early retirement and now he's enjoying his life. My greatest blessing is that he respects my dreams as well. I've heard a lot about this place from Annie. Wasn't it Mumma's favourite spot? Mumma was the one who loved travelling the most. We used to travel at least once every year. -Then we all got busy and... -Okay. Sunny, I forgot to get ice cream. If I don't buy it, the kids will kill me. Can you please get it?

Oh! -I would've paid. -Hey, no problem. These are my classmates. -Oh, hi! -Hello. -Hi. -Annie's husband? -Yes. -Merchant Navy? Yes. We're planning a booze party. You do drink, right? By the way, we don't have the sea or a ship here. You might have to adjust in a small canoe. I've boozed in a lifeboat while the ship was sinking. Please don't underestimate me.

Oh, yeah. It's been a while since I met such a close-knit family. Come. Yeah. Actually, we were supposed to return to Bombay today. Since there was a change in plan, all of us could be here together. This is my elder brother, Sunny. He runs a reputed event company in Kochi. -Hi, sir. -Hi. What's your company's name? -All is Well -All is Well? I've heard that name recently. Must be in some write-up? In which magazine? F... Forbes. Forbes? Is the shoot over, Annie dear? No, my dear brother. You seem to be really close with your elder brother. Of course! Yes. Ready, everyone? Come on, dear. Stand there. Simy, come, dear. Okay. Are you ready? Please put this in your pocket, Sandeep. -Oh, no! What happened? -It's just a small cut. -Should we get a tetanus shot? -No. It's not necessary. This happens regularly. Why are you taking this so casually? She had a similar injury two weeks back. She got an injection then. -Okay. -Ready? Ready! Smile! Madam, have a look. Wow!

Hey. Here you go. I don't need this now, Jerry. Okay. Grandpa! What made you name him Sunny? Your Grandma was really fond of the famous cricketer Sunil Gavaskar. Everyone used to call him Sunny. That's how your uncle was named Sunny. That's great. So, how about Uncle Jerry? There's a music director called Jerry Amaldev. Grandma loved his songs. Was everyone named as per Grandma's wish? Your Mumma was named by Grandpa. You know whose name it is? Please don't tell me it's Grandpa's first girlfriend's name. You little devil! Sophie should have been here too. When will Aunt Sophie come, Uncle? She will come. Aunt Sophie didn't get leave from work, dear. Oh! Is that what he has told you? How come you settled for a simple lie this time? So, Sunny... Shall I say it? What do you want to say? So, I can tell everyone then. -Get lost. -Oh! Arrogance. -Then I'll reveal it! -What's there to reveal? I had called Sophie. She told me everything. Jerry, don't make me slap you. Yeah, right! Sunny's 12th business has also flopped miserably! Sophie has been staying separately for the past couple of months. Papa, they are on the verge of a divorce! No, no, no! Jerry, no! Don't do it, Jerry! Please! -Let go of me! -Jerry! -Kiddo, what are you doing? -You! -Jerry! -Let go of me, Jerry! -Jerry! -Kiddo! -Jerry! -Annie! -Let go of him! -You! -Jerry, let go of him. -Move away! -My hand! -Move away! Hey, stop it! -Jerry, let him go. -Leave me! Jerry! Aren't you both ashamed? Why don't you just die? He's your elder brother! -But Annie Ma... -What's your problem? Just because you had a failure in the past, should you carry that burden like a loser even today? If Sunny was the reason for it, just talk it out! I can't bear the sight of people who waste their talents... making lame excuses! Had it been my son, I would've straightened him out! Jerry. And, Sandeep, please get this... Hey! Papa, I don't think we can go on like this for an entire week. -Excuse me. Where's the washroom? -Just turn right from here. Where's the registration desk? -It's inside. -Come. -All the best. -Oh, thank you. -Sir, the form for the audition? -What's the name? -Jerry Mary Das. -Jerry. Note it down. -Here you go. -Thank you. -Can I have a pen? -Yeah, sure. Hello. What's your name, son? Jerry Mary Das. That's quite a terrific name! Your singing should also have that terror! Terror in my singing? I'll try, sir. Ask him to sing. You can sing now, Jerry. Brother, chord D please. -Are you stressed? -A little bit. [singing "Puthumazhayayi" from the movie Mudra] -Is he good? -Yes, really good. Shall we make him sing a semi-classical song? Okay. Son... Jerry... Jerry Mary Das, right? Why don't you sing a semi-classical song? -What say? -Yes. [singing "Athira Varavayi" from the movie Thudarkadha] He is singing really well. He's trained in classical music. Son, Mary... I mean, Jerry... -Jerry. -I can't seem to get his name right. Jerry Mary Das... Your singing was really good. -Thank you, sir. -But... You haven't been selected. If that's the case, what will be your reaction? I'll try again during the next season, sir. Yes. -Are you sure? -Yes. Please come. Son... So, you'll try during the next season, right? You are in! Congratulations! Wow! Congratulations! -Thank you. -Thank you so much, ma'am. -Thank you, ma'am. Thank you, sir. -God bless you. -Congratulations. -Thank you, ma'am. Yes! Harikumar sir?

Jerry will be in my top three. -Keep it up. -Thank you so much. Wow! Amazing comment. Shall we go to the next judge? Hiranmayi ma'am. Jerry, mark my words. All the music directors in Malayalam cinema will be waiting to work with the singer called Jerry Mary Das. I consider it my privilege to have met you. Amazing! Amazing performance! -Thank you so much, ma'am. -Wow! It was fabulous. -Hiranmayi. -Sir? Don't say "all music directors" already. -Son! -Sir... I heard you singing some embellishments in the verse and chorus. What was it? Well, sir. I just tried a minor improvisation. Music directors like us compose these songs after putting in a lot of thoughts and effort. These embellishments aren't things that you can play with as you please. Understood? Okay, Jerry. Let's find out your score now. Let's start with Harikumar sir. Jerry, I am giving you 23 out of 30 marks today. Thank you, sir. -Aishwarya ma'am... -Jerry... I really liked your singing. You scored 28 out of 30. Thank you, ma'am. -Who allowed this drunkard inside the studio? Anil, come! -What is it, Anil? -Send him out! I've been hearing a commotion from the green room. Seems like he got beaten up really bad. How can he start reacting like this for judges' comments? -Is he drunk? -Yes. I saw him drinking in the parking lot earlier. Kannan, get the vehicle out quickly! He spoiled that poor boy's future. Jerry, take your brother to your room. He's really drunk. He shouldn't be here anymore. Rest, I'll let you know later. I'll call you. Okay. Jerry! Come, let's go. Though we requested him several times, Sunny wasn't ready to apologise to Harikumar sir. Jerry got out during the next round unexpectedly. They said his votes were low. Everyone knew that it was because Sunny got drunk and manhandled Harikumar sir. I've never followed these reality shows. I didn't know about this. That reality show went on with many new seasons. Gradually, everyone forgot Jerry Mary Das. If he had cleared that round, he would have gotten an opportunity to sing in a superhit movie that was released then. Losing all that shattered him completely. Jerry's relationship with Sunny has never been the same since then. He was just 17 years old then. He couldn't take that sudden fall from stardom. He stopped pursuing music altogether. He is adamant that he won't sing again. You know how stubborn he is, right? I've never heard him sing. Not even during our office parties. Never! If my brother and I fight, Dad scolds us. Why don't you scold your sons, Grandpa? Hey, Rukku! Let Grandpa rest. Come. What happened to Grandpa? His sugar level must be low. He'll be fine if you give him a chocolate, Dad. So that you can eat it, right? Where are you going? I don't want to spend another second here with him. Go and get ready. Do you have to upset everyone for such an old issue? Oops! Oh! So, you've come after listening to the entire flashback, huh? Get ready quickly. Let's go. You're not the person I've known so far. I didn't think that you'd be so immature, Jerry. He is your own brother. He has had drunken brawls at so many places. I never took all that seriously. But he played with my life that day. He ruined my career. Let's not talk about this, Simy. Please. Uncle, are you leaving? Uncle. What is it, Rukku? It's my birthday celebration tomorrow. Won't you be here? Please. I'll be here. So, you know how to obey, huh? Thank you, Dad. Get going. O foolish people who believe that the loudest cry is silence! You have raised a society without a spine! Do you think you deserve to stand up? What right do you have to protest? Hey! Didn't I ask you to change the dialogues? This is not enough. This won't create an impact. Think about it once again. I'll be right back. Okay, Rajesh. Why are you sitting here alone? Nothing in particular. Don't say that. If we could travel back in time and correct all the stupid acts and bad decisions we made, it would have been great. College, this drinking habit, wayward friends and many such things. Oh! You mean a time machine? If your papa and mumma had gone on a time machine, I wouldn't have had to tolerate you. Having no one in your life is a blessing, isn't it? What made you think so? I've always seen you with a smile on your face. What is it? It's just a guava. Nothing else. What else do you usually have with you? Nothing. So, my Kiddo is having guava here? Why do you always call me Kiddo? Why shouldn't I? You're a kiddo, right? My Kiddo! Though whatever you said was true, it was really hurtful to hear it from you. I know which remark of mine hurt you. Forgive me. I'll never stop irritating you. When you feel like losing it, just take me to a corner and tell me what you have to say. If you shout at me in front of everyone else... What will you do then? I'll forget that you're my sister and curse you silently. I'll slap you! I don't care what anyone else says. But you shouldn't talk to me like that, Annie Ma. -Okay, Kiddo! -There you go again. Let that innocence prevail in your name at least. Though your actions speak otherwise. Give me a piece. You want a piece? I'll give you. There you go! Hey! Stop! Kiddo! Hello! Yeah! Okay. Now she's back to her old self. Now she's normal. Oh, no! Not there. Keep it in the kitchen. I didn't mean to keep it here. I was just taking a breather. Okay. Go inside! Can that go back inside? Sunil, didn't I ask you to bring white daisy flowers? It wasn't available, sir. I tried my best. It's out-of-stock everywhere. Since it's a function in your house, we tried our best. Is that so? Then, it's fine. This is good too. What's so good? We specifically asked for those flowers, right? You didn't say anything then. Ma'am, there were two other functions today. That's why we ran short. Oh! Is that so? Then, it's fine. Isn't that what I said? Wind this up and get going then! I will get someone who actually delivers what they say. No, ma'am. I'll arrange it quickly somehow. Make it fast. You should finish before noon. Don't be here fixing this when guests come in the evening. No. Is this how you handle your big events, Sunny? Hey... Do whatever is necessary over here. -Sandeep-- -The caterers will reach at 3 p.m. -And... -The sound system is on the way. Okay. Annie, why is Rajesh still unmarried? "There's nothing more blissful than bachelorhood." -That's his philosophy. -Is it? He doesn't look like he's so intelligent. Let me make a quick trip to Qutub Minar. Okay. Or forget it. It's too far. Taj Mahal is better. Come back quickly. Being a bachelor does have its merits. Hey. One strong wind and you'll fall. That's why I called you softly. Doesn't matter if you're a businessman or a writer once you fall. Come with me. We thought you were thinking of some story or poem. That's why we didn't disturb you. Didn't you drink it yet? Down it, bro! No, man. I can't go overboard. Only I can handle everything there. My dear bro, just stop it. You conduct huge events worth millions! And you're worried about your little niece's birthday? Do a video call with your manager, bro. There's no signal here, dude. Oh! Damn it! There's no signal here. -Sorry. -That has one advantage. My wife won't bother me asking where I am and who I am with. It's so peaceful. Bro, we're so jealous of you in that aspect. We keep talking about it. You married the girl you loved, and your life is going great. Lucky fellow. You have a happy life. -Right, dude? -Of course. Shall I help you, Lisy? No, it's okay. I'll do it. The wind, the rain and the mist were born to the same mother. While running around for no reason, the three of them had forgotten to express their true selves, as they were busy in their own worlds. The earth had started drying up. The moisture was waning. The heat within had increased manifold. Where the chances of something new to sprout were lean, there were many seeds waiting to sprout even at the slightest shower, and they were keenly looking forward to a shower of love. SUNNY MARY DAS Don't take it. Sunny won't like it. Okay. You can't play this just like that. -Why? -It needs an electric connection. Oh, okay. We're late. Rajesh will roast us. Definitely. Where is he? There he is! Rajesh, the cake is ready. Keep it there. You've reached? I was about to come there since you were getting late. -Good that we came here. -How much? Oh, no! It's not necessary, Rajesh. Tell me the price. Rajesh is not a freeloader. Then give me Rs. 3,000. -Huh? -It's a special rate. You'll regret if the cake is not special. I ordered this on my risk! -The cake is superb. -Good for you, then. We brought a master baker from the nearby town, specially to bake it. Okay, thank you. Do come to the party. -Okay. -Careful. Both of you seem to be really happy. -No. -Nothing like that. Get going. Annie, the cake is ready! What's with this look, Rajesh? Is this your attire for the birthday party? What is this? The cake is here. Rajesh, make this permanent. It's awesome. It wasn't me. It was Rukku. Hello? Tell me, dude! Where are you? Long time! Renowned music director Harikumar is in the line of fire after a sexual harassment allegation by popular singer Ardra Sivadas. This is the second allegation against him that has surfaced within a week. As your revelations have given rise to fresh controversies, what more do you have to say about this, Ardra? Harikumar sir is responsible for the most disturbing memory in my life. One day, while I was alone in the green room, he tried to molest me. But, luckily, another contestant's elder brother happened to come there. He was the one who saved me. But I must ask this question. Why didn't you complain about this to anyone back then? It was because of my mother. She believed that incident might snowball into a controversy and ruin my life and career. My mother begged that person to stay silent about the whole incident. I am revealing this now because no other girl should go through such an experience again. Just because you had a failure in the past... If Sunny was the reason for it, just talk it out! Xavier, where is Sunny? He has been missing since morning. Hey, Jerry! Come here. Oh, no! It's Uncle "Nosy" Cheriyan. Phew! He didn't call me. Come here. Simy, come here, dear. -Mr. Das, we'll go set it up. -Okay. Simy, his girlfriend. Hello. Son, who is this girl to you? My girlfriend. What? What is it, Cheriyan? It's a pleasure to even hear about such things, right? Oh! Like that? Lucky boy! How come you got ready so early? Early? It's already late. My dear, I was just joking. My jokes haven't been working lately. Rukku, come! Don't you want to wear the princess costume? Come. -I'll send her back soon. -Okay. Come on! When will you reach, Sunny? Get started. I'm on my way. Okay. -It's Sunny. He is on his way. -Okay. How come you never thought of getting married, Rajesh? Like Abdul Kalam and Vajpayee, I have also dedicated my life for the nation. You really loved Annie, didn't you? Then what happened? Annie is a perfectionist, Sandeep. She chooses only the best. Especially when it comes to her life partner. Rukku, you look so nice! -Wow! -Rukku! -Wow, Rukku! -Big cake! Go, go. -Wow! -Jerry... Did you like it? Beautiful cake, right? Bro, where's Sunny? I had called him. He's on his way. Don't cut it already. Blow the candles first. Okay? -Ready... One... -Wow! ♪ Happy birthday to you! ♪ ♪ Happy birthday, dear Rukku! ♪ ♪ Happy birthday to you! ♪ -Have it, dear. -For your dad. -Take it. -Give it to your dad. For Mumma? No, give it to Uncle Sunny first. -Happy birthday, Rukku. -Thank you, Uncle. I'll tell you later. Hey, Jerry! Son, what does your girlfriend do in Bangalore? We work together there. Is it? Sunny, the drinks are ready over there. -Not now. After some time. -Yeah, right. Just go there. Go! -They're living together, it seems! -Just keep quiet. Hey, what's your opinion about me getting a transfer to Bangalore? Don't come back after that. Okay. That's enough.

Papa... I invited Sophie. Hi, Rukku. Happy birthday. Thank you, Aunt Sophie! Hey. That's enough. Let's go. -I'm not going there now. -Just come with me, dude. Listen to me, Rajesh. It won't be nice if I go there now. I've heard an old saying. When your hair starts greying, your fear starts growing. Fear? For whom? Not for me. Then? Let's go. Sit down. Lisy, give them food. Go to sleep, okay? -Come, dear. -Paul, go with her. Who are you? Do I know you? I asked Sophie to come. I feel an open conversation can solve all your problems. You better sort everything out today. Dear... Sunny knows all my problems very well, Papa. When I keep pointing out, he mends his ways for a while. But, after a week, he forgets all that and goes back to his old self. I don't have anything to say. This is his attitude, Papa. He never has any answers. You need answers for everything! You need explanations! Tone it down! When I'm struggling day and night to make ends meet... And do they meet? Money is not the issue, Papa. He doesn't even spare some time for me. Such thoughts are long gone from his mind. What do you mean by saying I don't spend time with you? Is it because I don't listen to your hospital stories when I'm about to get some sleep after toiling the whole day? Or is it because I don't report back to you about my day? My mind is not a computer to store every minute detail. This is the problem, Papa. He's always looking for the right time for everything. He'll talk to me only on days when he's home early. He will take me out only if his mood is okay. I don't remember the last time we went out, even for a movie. What is this, son? Don't talk nonsense with a biased mind! Hey! Hey, Mr. Das! We're leaving. -Sunny... -Get lost. ...Sophie dear, Jerry, girlfriend, Annie, bye! Come, let's go. So, almost everyone has had dinner. You guys can close the counter, okay? It would be better for all of us if we end this conversation right now. He won't understand, Papa. Whatever logic we put forth, he won't understand. He will have his justifications for everything. False justifications. I'm an expert at lying, right? That's my only talent. No! You know really well how to taunt and hurt people's emotions as well. -Where are you going? -We were just-- Wait! You should also hear this. To be frank, I am fed up. In every way. How long can I live a lie, fooling people? Unlike what you think, I've accomplished nothing in life. I'm just a zero. A big zero! I tried many businesses. All of them flopped. Some of them flopped before they even took off. This event management company was the last ray of hope. That has failed too. We shut shop. Didn't you ask why I don't write anymore? I used to write until a few years back. Even amidst all my troubles, I used to find some time for myself. She's the reason I stopped writing and started ventures I had no clue about. Hey, calm down. She wants to migrate to Canada. I'm not interested. As you know, I was never interested in leaving this place. I got settled in Kochi for her sake. Who got settled? Forget that. How did the Canada plan get cancelled? Say that as well. Papa, he took the money I had saved up by selling all my gold, promising to return it within a week and used it to pay off his dues. And that week never came. Hey, Sunny. If you were in need of money, why didn't you tell me? From what I've understood, I don't think she's at fault. You should understand things and behave accordingly. You won't understand, Papa. If Mumma was alive, before listening to her problems and taking her side, she would have understood what I am going through. But who has the time to understand my woes? Sunny, tell me. I'll try to understand. You try to understand your husband and children first! You are extremely lucky. If it wasn't for Sandeep who supports all your whims and fancies... You don't have to worry about my family. You always blame others to hide your own faults. Hey, if this is where the conversation is headed, let's end it right here. I invited Sophie to solve problems between the two of you. Not to make it worse. How many more lives will he ruin with his drunken outbursts and brawls? Sophie, I don't see any fault on your side. Understood. She's not at fault at all. So, you mean to say... I never understood her? Papa... you have no idea. She... she killed my child. The day I came to know that everything was over. There's no point continuing, Papa. What are you saying? I'm not saying anything more! Papa, ask her to leave right away. Or else, I will. Got it. Sunny, please. Now, what do you want? You want me dead, right? Let it be the end of it. -Sunny! -Kiddo! Annie Ma... Let him be alone for some time. I am well aware that I made a mistake. But, back then, I couldn't think straight. I wasn't even sure whether Sunny would be with me in the future. I was all alone! Sunny should've been a bit more understanding towards Sophie. Haven't you seen how Sandeep supports me, Papa? Annie, don't compare. -That's not right. -Why not? Whatever Sophie said is true, right? Didn't you hear what Sunny had to say? He's someone who's struggling financially even at this age. We don't have such a worry. The frustration of someone who does a job he doesn't like to get settled in life... That's beyond our understanding. And the fact that they don't have children. It's a huge difference. She might not have wanted to bring a child into this mess. Hey, before opting for an abortion, Sophie should have at least consulted with him. He has completely shut her off! How will communication happen then? Sunny is not spending any time with Sophie. Piling up one's emotions without expressing them usually leads to grave tragedies. Annie... there are issues in every family. You should also be spending more time with us. Your business is running smoothly now, right? You can easily distribute some of your workload among your subordinates. What are you saying, Sandeep? I took an early retirement to spend time with my family. But my family is incomplete without you, Annie. But... Ever since we came here, how much time have you spent with us, keeping everything else aside? To be frank, it's like all of us are spending our vacation in your office. Our children will grow up in the blink of an eye. You have no clue what you're missing. Listen... I just mentioned it. You needn't worry about it. No one is perfect. Shucks! I didn't mean to say all those things. When everyone started cornering me, I lost control. At times, expressing yourself is a good thing. But in private. Not in public, like this. I don't have many grievances against her. There are many mistakes on my part as well. I'm ready to correct them too. But... What she did to me... She shouldn't have aborted our child. Without a mutual understanding and trust, it's really difficult to go forward. You know Sophie. She's not a bad person, right? Come on. Let's go home. Get up. Let's go. Did I go overboard? I don't remember half the things I said. You remember shouting at your father, right? I shouted at Papa? I'm just kidding. Get me something to eat. We'll go home and have food. Or all that food will be wasted. -How much, brother? -Rs. 20. I was not aware. I'm sorry. Hey. I just said that in a flow. Leave it. I'll correct myself. Oh, come on! What is it, Rajesh? What happened to him? I don't know, Mr. Das. He suddenly fell unconscious. He is in deep distress. Mary had specifically told me to take good care of him. I didn't pay heed to it. It's my mistake. Grandpa... It's okay to fight with each other. But... you should love each other twice as much. What happened to him? I never tried to understand my brother, Annie Ma. I've always wished to be... a part of this family. Such affectionate parents... siblings who competed in loving each other... I've always watched your family with admiration. Must be my evil eye. The pain... of someone who has only four walls to talk to at home... You won't understand it. Don't ruin everything. -How is he, Doctor? -He is all right now. What happened to him? It's a seizure, Mr. Das. He was really drunk. It's a sudden withdrawal as a result of that. And I think he hadn't eaten anything. So, his sugar level dropped suddenly. That's how it happened. Let him be under observation for the night. You can take him home tomorrow. Can we see him? Not everyone together. One of you can go inside and see him. Okay?
