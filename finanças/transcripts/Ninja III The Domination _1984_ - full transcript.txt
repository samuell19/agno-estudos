You'd get charged for assault for what you did to those guys. - Well that's my problem. And I don't need any help. Especially from you, Officer Secord. - You know, I am sick and tired about hearing how you don't like cops. Because I wanna tell you something, miss Independence. I like being a cop.

I had a nightmare so I decided to put some clothes away. - God, this is beautiful. Where did you get this? - It's Japanese. One of these days I'm gonna hang it on my wall. - You're full of surprises aren't ya? Paris and Oslo is in its final boarding process at gate 35. - It is an honor to be your guest. - The honor is ours, Yamada-san. - I'm grateful for the letter you sent me to Japan. - We have bad news, Yamada-san.

You mother! I'll kill you, you son of a bitch! What the hell? What the... No, no. No, please. No, no, please. Please. - They murdered him! - Billy, I think there's something wrong with me. I can sense things before they even happen. I find things in the apartment. And I don't even know where they came from. Look at this. - Jesus! How did you get that? - I don't remember. - What do you mean you don't remember? - I mean I don't remember. I go blank for hours. Maybe even longer. I feel like there's somebody making me do things. Things that I don't wanna do. - Then do something about it. - Honey, I don't know what to do. - I'll help you sweetheart. - Medically you're a very fit young woman. No evidence of any abnormality in the brain. No tumor. You have a strong heart. Your diet is better than average. You are under severe stress of course. But otherwise, Doctor Boland, the psychiatrist you saw, says there's nothing out of the ordinary. Aside from your exceptional extra sensory perception. And your pre-occupation with Japanese culture. No harm in that. - Excuse me? Have you seen Officer Secord? - No I haven't. - Oh well, we'll just see who put me up to it. So are we going with you? - You know what I really want to do? I wanna go in a police car. - Me too, me too! Can I put on the siren and the lights? - Shot me down right away. - Can I? - Come on. - Okay, okay! - Oh I'll get it. You guys just sit there. Who could this be? This is crazy. Oh hi. Come on in. We could use some more towels. Ooh it's hot. Don't pull me. This feels good. We've been having fun! - Who's she? I don't know. But it's alright. - You better watch yourself big man! What the hell kind of place is this? - Beat it bitch! What's going on? Jeez. Go ahead kid. The son of bitch is all yours. Oh let's split. - No, I wanna watch. - This guy is a real jerk. - Boy, you said it. - Let's get outta here. What is she doing to him? - I don't know. But the bastard seems to be enjoying it doesn't he? - Sure is. Hey. What's the matter with him? No! What are you doing? - No! - Christie? Christie? Where the hell have you been? I looked everywhere for you. Christie? Christie? What is going on? Where have you been? - I don't know. - You gotta know. You've been gone since noon. - Billy, I don't care what these doctors say. There's something wrong with me. I try to fight it. But I can't even remember what. Or why. There's somebody, Billy. I can feel it in the room sometimes near me. - Listen. There's an officer in the Asiatic division. He told me there's this guy downtown the local Japanese swear by. - For your information, Billy, I don't believe in demons, ghosts, spirits, or any of that kind of stuff. - Well neither do I. But when you blank out, we don't know what to believe in do we? - Billy, I don't think this is such a good idea. - Hello. - Hi. - My name is Billy Secord. We spoke on the phone. - Oh yes, you are expected. Would you follow me? - It is wise of you to come, oh young ones. He is here now. I can tell you much more. Come. Follow me. - Sure beats the Rocky Horror Picture Show. - Give him a chance. - These are necessary. In case the spirit becomes angry. - Isn't he even gonna ask me what the problem is? - Just relax. - Move back, leave her. - Don't worry sweetheart. I'll be right here. Please answer now. Is he in you? - Yes. He is. And he wants you to stop! - Who are you? - Oh my god. - Maybe we better stop. - No. You finish it. Get rid of the son of a bitch. - I don't know what is wrong. - What are you doing? - I must obey the spirit. He wishes me to cut her loose. - No! - No, no, don't. Stop. Please forgive him. The fool does not know what a terrible mistake he's making. Help me! Oh Billy, help me! I'm scared! You fool! You cannot stop me! I am a ninja! No one, nothing can stop me! He is gone. - Are you sure? - He's tired himself. But he will return. - When? - I cannot say. - I wanna know who he is. - I cannot tell you any more. - I heard "ninja". I wanna know what the hell that is. It is better if you not know too much. For your own sake. - You tell me, you old bastard. Or I'm gonna bust you right now. - She is possessed by a black ninja. With all the powers of the nine hand cutting. Nothing can be done. I tell you she will be totally... - Don't tell me nothing can be done! I want you to help her! - Sorry. I cannot. There is one thing. - What? - In the Eagle Mountain in Japan. The very one power that can destroy him. - Japan. - Only a ninja can destroy a ninja. - Freeze! - Hey! Excuse me. Who are you? - Can we help you? - How'd you get in here? - Yeah? - So are you gonna tell me what happened? - He hypnotized you that's all. - So why all the bruises? Come on Billy. You can tell me. - I don't think he knew what he was doing. The guy's probably a fake. - There's something you're not telling me. - How's it going? - Christie? - I'm sorry. Hi. - Marty Winslow. Sergeant Pickwick, this is Christie. - I know the lady's beautiful. But don't forget the funeral. - 4:30, Clark City Cemetery. - Yeah, I'll try and make it. Anything new? - Nothing. Just speculation the killings are linked to that professional assassin we wasted at the golf course last week. - That stiff you found, it was stolen out of the morgue. Now the chief believes it's a professional job. Some sort of Japanese mafia or something. - Yeah. So be careful. See you at 4:30. - No you don't. Not again. Damn you! Just leave me alone! Stop it! No! ♪ I dream about you all the time ♪ ♪ I can't think about nothing else ♪ - No! No! No! - And we share together the psalm of David. Psalm 23. The Lord is my shepherd. I shall not want. He makes me lie down in green pastures. He leads me beside quiet waters. He restores my soul. He guides me in the paths of righteousness for his name's sake. Even though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death I will fear no evil for thou art with me. Thy rod and thy staff they comfort me. Thou has prepared a table before me in the presence of mine enemies. Thou has anointed my head with oil. My cup overflows. Surely goodness and loving kindness will follow me all of the days of my life. And I will dwell in the house of the Lord forever. The earth is the Lord's and all it contains. On guard. Salute. Cadets. - Give me a gun, somebody give me a gun! - Open that trunk. Give me a baton. - Me too. Let's go. Come on. Hold it! - He's over here! Blow him away! He's up there! Give us some support! Come on up here! - Come over here! - Let him have it! See him over there? - Freeze! - Hold it! - Spread 'em! - Let me talk to him. - Move it. - I have to ask... - I was waiting for you. - You know me? - You know where the sword is? - Maybe. - Do not hesitate. I have come from Japan to revenge. I know what should be done. - You're a ninja! - It doesn't matter. Go and get the girl and the sword, and take them to the old temple. On the hill. Wait for me. Don't worry. - Hey. Hey Charlie. Hey what's going on here? - They are only sleeping. - Hey! - Billy, you scared me. God, I'm so glad you're here... - Don't move. - What are you doing? - I said just don't move. They're all dead Christie. You killed them. I saw everything. - I haven't killed anybody. - Listen to me. There's a man here from Japan. A ninja. We're gonna go meet him at that old temple on the hill. And he is going to help you. I can't... - Don't move! - I could never do anything to hurt you. - Oh God I hope that's true. Put your hands out in front of you. - But Billy... - Put your hands out in front of you! - I love you. - Christie no. Christie no. Christie! Wake up now. Come on, come on. Damn! - You're the ninja. You can help me? - Yes. - Is it true that only a ninja can destroy a ninja? - It's true. - Help me please. I must get rid of him. - Do you know what I must do? - Do what you have to. I don't wanna hurt anyone else. - It might be dangerous for you. - Will I die? - Not if the spirit leaves you. And returns to his body. Then I will destroy him. And you will be safe. - And if it doesn't, you'll kill me. - Oh no. Come on Christie. Come on. - Billy? I think I'm gonna be alright now. - Oh I love you! - I love you. Billy wait. - Christie no! - It's over now.
