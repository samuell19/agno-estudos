Every day, we pass strangers around us, exchanging smiles, friendly nods... maybe even a "Merry Christmas" if we're in the spirit. And as we smile and greet that stranger, you may think to yourself, "I wonder what their life is like?" You might not even think about it for more than a moment, as your paths aren't likely to cross again... ...yet these complete strangers would find their way to one other... ...forming bonds that, at first, may seem unlikely. Sometimes, we discover, those bonds may turn out to be the very best kind. There you go! Are you happy now? I am. Now you can play 1/12th of "Silent Night". - Wonderful! - Mm-hmm. Well... when we meet our deadline and deliver these paintings to the Christmas Gallery, then you can teach me the other 11 parts. How's that? I know you're worried about us not selling enough at the gallery to make rent, but... God will make a way. You're right. Please, God, let the love of my life come over here and help me finish these paintings. Amen. Happy first day of December, Traci! I got you a little something. Isn't it a little early for a little something? Thought it might liven the place up. There's chocolates for each day! That'll get you in the spirit. Thank you. I love it. Is excessive consumption of sweets a stage of grief? Because if so, then I am really cruising through that part of the process. All right, let's see, only... 23 more chocolates until our... my annual Christmas exhibition. Want to see what I've been working on? Mm! Great! You just wait! This I like to call... "Silent Not". Oh, boy. Yeah. And this little, sweet gem over here I like to call "Riding in a Half-Horse, Open Sleigh". Okay, Trace, I am your best friend first and your manager second... And while the manager side of me is a little nervous you won't be done for Christmas Eve, the friend side of me... understands. If you need to take another year off, take it. No. No. It's been two years, Joyce. I have to do this. I have to figure out how to work without him. It's just... we complemented each other in... every way, you know? I don't know, I... I see potential here. I think you can do this. And I know exactly what you need to do next. Plant myself in front of that easel until I've finished my masterpiece? No, silly... clear your mind! I'm taking you Christmas shopping! - No! - Yup! Yes! 100%! Can't be sad at the Christmas market. It's illegal. You've just had too much. I can't help myself. Hey! You guys are still here? Well, we were chatting after the meeting as usual... Which then turned into us getting a three-hour hot chocolate together... Which then ended in me realizing I forgot my scarf at church, so we came back here to get it. I see. That's when we noticed our beloved leader working away here! You need help? No, no, no. You guys, no. Look, I've got it covered. I think I'm ready to deliver these boxes to the women's shelter, and children's hospital youth center... So I'm good. Hey, Mike, I have a question. Are you the real Santa Claus? Give us your best "Ho-Ho-Ho". Ho-ho-ho, Justin! Oh, but that wasn't a no. No, No. Listen... I appreciate the offer, I do, but I really would like to deliver these solo, if I could. All right. But... promise us that you will also do something for yourself. You spend all your time helping everyone else. I know I do, and I will, okay? Okay. Now... I love you guys, but... let's go! Out! Okay! We're going! We're going, we're going. - See ya. - See ya later. Here we go. Ah, yes. Come on! Pick any one you want, my treat! All right, um... Ooh! How about that one? Hmm. - Oh! - Oh, I'm sorry! No, no, no, no! You take it! Please, I insist. You touched it one second before me, so, technically, you had dibs. Oh. So those are the rules for "dibs" then, huh? I don't make the rules, I do enforce them. - Thank you. - Yeah. Two strangers insisting the other gets what they want certainly beats the alternative this time of year, huh? Oh, you... you should have seen the tug-of-war I witnessed between two moms and a toy car on Black Friday. I can only imagine. Brutal. You know, you take this. What? You can have it. I... I... I have to go. Yeah. Have a nice day. What was that all about? He looks familiar. I think he goes to the church that Greg and I went to. - Grace Community? - Yeah. My memory's fuzzy, but I think he led a support group there. Of course, I haven't been back since... You know, when my aunt passed away a few years back, I went to a grief-support group at a local church. It really helped me. There's just something special about healing alongside others who are going through the same thing. And look! Grace has one, too! Thank you. I just don't think it's my thing. I don't. Besides, I'm feeling like my old self again! Yeah! Joy! Happiness! Fun! Boop-boop-boop! I'm not fooling anyone, am I? Who knows. Maybe it will help you move past this "painter block". I'll take this one. How's that? It's gorgeous. We'll take it. All right. Thank you. Here you go. Made your favorite... Pancakes, Christmas-style, with red and green sprinkles. Dad, you do know I'm not five years old anymore, right? Well, you know what... they actually still do the trick. Thank you. How's the Christmas painting coming along? Well, it's not exactly coming along quite yet. There is clearly something missing. Well... we think it is so admirable that you're choosing to carry on the work that you two shared together. Maybe you just need a little inspiration? My childhood art projects? Where did you dig these up? I found them when I was cleaning the other day. Do you remember the very first art show that you put on for us? Yes, I was about the same age as when you used to make me these pancakes. Look, it's Freddy Teddy. Do you remember Freddy Teddy? I remember Freddy Teddy. I stood in line for hours for a "Freddy Teddy". This is not bad for a kid. - Not bad at all. - No. Try to remember why you became an artist in the first place. To make people feel something special. And isn't that what brought you and Greg together? I'm sorry, Trace. I didn't mean to... No, no, no, no, no. Dad, it's... it's okay. Just some memories just hit harder than others. Well, don't forget that we are here for you. We are so... blessed... that we're your parents. And I am so lucky to be your daughter. Are you copying me? - Oh... - I'm gonna tell the teacher. No, no. I was... admiring the colors and the detail. It's a lot better than mine. I don't know. I think you're in good shape. Aw, thank you. I work out. I'm Greg. Traci. Traci Fremont! Patricia. It's been a while. Yes! Oh! It's so good to have you back for the gallery this Christmas! We really missed you last year. Now, Joyce said she was working on the press release. How is... Press release? Um... I thought you knew. You are committed, right? No. Yes, yes, yes! I am. Yes. Sorry, it just... Listen, if you're still not ready... I am. I am. I just... I need to make a call. - Okay. - Okay. Joyce, hey. I was thinking about our conversation at the market. What time is that next meeting? - What's her name? - Traci, I think. Yeah, I think so. So we'll just wait. Hey, there she is. Hey! Hey. You... you must be Traci. I am. We got your email about possibly joining the group. I'm sorry. You look extremely familiar to me. Have we met? At the Christmas market. Remember the ornament? Oh, yes! That's right. Yeah. Yeah. That's very... very funny. Please! Come on, join us. Have a seat. My name is Michael. I'm sort of the fearless leader of our little group here. Mostly fearless... Except when he sees a spider. Okay, come on. You should've seen him the other day... he jumped, like, three feet in the air! Okay, well, yes... And I only did that once... Because the spider was really big. It was about, like, that. So, this is... this is everybody? Yes. No, it's... yeah, this is everybody. We're kind of small but mighty! Right, you guys? I'll introduce you. This is Ethel. Hello. We have Regina here. - Hi. - Hi. And Justin. Hi! Hi. So, what do you say we get started, huh? Traci, before every session, we like to bow our heads in prayer. Dear God, I want to thank you for bringing us all together tonight. The team handling his surgery is the best there is. So there's hope? In his case, in particular... it's a risky procedure. I'd be doing you a disservice if I gave you false hope. But we've prayed. Me, our church, family, and friends, we've prayed. He'll be okay. - Amen. - Amen! I'm really sorry, everyone. I, um... It was nice meeting you. Traci! Traci! Are you okay? No. No, I am... I thought I was ready. I'm not. Look, the hardest part is just showing up. Okay? We just want you to feel welcome here, that's all. Thank you. Thank you, but... I can't. I can't. Okay... Good work, partner. Thank you. Hey, what do you say we donate this one? Yeah. 'Tis the season. God provided for us and now we get to bless someone else. I love it. I'm lucky... that you said yes to that hot chocolate all those years ago. Oh, ho, ho. You're just lucky that place was stocked full of marshmallows. I'm just glad we get to do this for the rest of our lives. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Excuse me. Oh! Oops. It's okay. I have a thousand of these shirts. Do not worry about anything, okay? It was my fault. I shouldn't have snuck up on you like that... Especially when you were in the zone. - Oh... - Do you paint? - I do. - Wow, really? Yeah. That's fabulous, because I could... use your expertise, if you don't mind. I'm looking for the right paint for toy wooden trains. Toy wooden trains? Yeah, yeah. It's something the group does every year at Christmas. Oh. This year, we're providing toys to the youth center so they can decorate. Do our work and stuff like that. - That's really sweet. - Thank you. It kinda even sounds like... - Fun? - Fun. - Fun! - Yeah. No, it's a lot of fun, actually. We like to mix things up. I mean... Talking in a circle is just one of the things we do, but... yeah. - Quick recommendation? - Sure! - Yes, are you kidding? Please. - Okay. Great. Um, I would recommend the non-toxic acrylic. Okay. Especially since it's kids, right? They have every color imaginable. I'll just pull some for you. Ah, this is amazing. Thank you so much. Of course! Green, Christmas. Okay... It's kind of funny that we just bumped into each other again like this. You know, at first, the market, then group, then here. Ooh! Nice catch. Well, they do say third time's a charm. Except that... not so lucky. Yeah, well... you know, people do say it's either luck, or fate, or God. Or a complete coincidence. Thank you. Well, I don't really believe in coincidences, so. - Uh, hey? - Yeah? I just wanted to apologize again for the other night. To be honest... prayer is tough for me. I don't know what I was expecting walking into a church. Hey, it's okay. It's fine, it's fine. My offer still stands. You know, we'd love to have you, and no praying required, okay? All right? So, how much... No, no, no. It's on me. Because that's on him. - Thank you very much. - Yes, of course. I think the blue actually does help bring out my eyes. What do you think? - Mom? - Hmm? What other things was I good at growing up? What weren't you good at! Math, Science, making necklaces out of those little candies... A mathematician and scientist are probably more practical careers, but making candy necklaces sounds like a lot more fun. Uh-oh. Has your creative block progressed to the point where you're considering changing careers? It's just I kept the apartment for the art studio, but now I don't even want to make art, so. You might feel that way now, but you'll get your groove back. You know, it just takes time. Or maybe it's time I let it go. You know... Greg loved talking about your gifts, your compassion, your... perseverance... your knack for helping others. So, before you go make any big decisions, think about the ways that your... gifts influence your art. Whoa! Did Michelangelo design these? Oh, Dad. Hey, where are you going with those? Well... I am going to take them to some people... who could use a little Christmas cheer. That looks great, Ethel. Thank you. Thank you for taking the lead on the trimmings. You're welcome. So what do you say we get started, guys? Huh? Yeah, sounds good. It's about time. All right... Hi. I brought cookies. I hope I don't spoil your dinner. Not at all. Justin already spoiled our dinner! But we always have room for more. Well... technically, they are "apology cookies". I am... I'm really sorry for running out. No need to apologize, dear. We're just happy you came back! This group is all about second chances. Yeah, and third chances, fourth chances... however many it takes. Yeah. So, since this is Traci's official first meeting, I'd like to remind everybody this is a judgment-free zone here. Speak freely, honestly, but only if you're led, and keep in mind that whatever is said here... stays here. Okay? I thought we'd start with some check-ins. Let's have a seat, shall we? Okay. I took a trip down to the Christmas market, where Ron and I used to play Santa and Mrs. Claus. I didn't stay for very long, but I... I did manage to sit with the discomfort for a little while. That's good, because I know that you and Ron have shared a lot of memories there. So many happy ones. Ron was the best Santa in the whole world. We married later in life, so we never had any kids of our own. But one year, Ron had the idea to volunteer as Santa. Definitely on the Nice List. He already had the look down pat. Santa sees a toy truck in your future. Oh! What would I do without you, Mrs. Claus? Plus the occasional kid that would tug on his beard to make sure he was the real Santa. Yeah. His beard was real. It was real. My husband passed away a couple of years ago, and... life has not been the same since then, but... the passing of time helps. Especially when you're surrounded by loved ones. Thank you. Thank you! Thank you. Yeah. May I actually go next? Of course. Yeah, I... I was supposed to stop by my parents' house the other night for dinner, but... I just told myself it would end in another argument. So I went back to the bakery, as usual. I mean, it's just... I think it's just where I feel closest to Nai Nai. Oh! Nai Nai is my grandmother. Yeah, I've been running her bakery ever since she passed away last year, hence our weekly sugar-rushes. Thank you. I dropped out of law school to take it over. And that did not go over well with my dad. Well, Justin, I know you'll patch things up with your dad. You will. When the time is right, okay? Thanks. I hope so. Regina? Would you like to share anything today? That's totally okay. Traci? And there's no pressure at all. I feel angry. Okay. That's all I really want to say. Thank you for sharing. Thank you, all. And the fire alarm in the kitchen was blaring. When the firefighters showed up, I was mortified. I mean, it was my first time baking all those pies at once. You know, Nai Nai trusted I could do it all on my own, but she probably trusted me a little too much. But, you know, she still gave me another chance after that, and that's what I loved about her. She... she embodied the spirit of forgiveness. I think your Nai Nai and I would have made fast friends. No doubt about it. I... I have a question. Sure. Does talking about all this... ever make you feel like you're just reliving the pain of the loss of them over and over again? I felt a lot of anger, too. It seemed like everyone was trying really hard to say the right thing. I appreciated their efforts, but I was so angry that nobody could really understand. They understand. So... I just want to say, before we close tonight, I need to discuss one small order of business. Now, I know we all know that helping others during the holiday season, it's a big thing of what we do here, so we are all volunteering at the children's youth center this Sunday for the Polar Express Christmas Party. But we have to all discuss how we can contribute, so... I've got baked goods covered. Check. - I could bring some decorations. - Love it. I can handle story-telling. Good. Okay. There's one thing missing. We need somebody who can actually help paint toy trains. Man, I wish we knew somebody with that skill set... I will be there. Great! Thank you, Traci! Yes. All right, session complete. See you all this weekend. Hi. Hey. You seem... happy. Well, why wouldn't I be? Look who's sitting next to me. Traci! Traci! Hey. Um... I just wanted to say I'm glad you came tonight. Oh... All right, listen. Hit me with it... First impressions? Everyone was warm and welcoming. Sorry my contributions were a bit... minimal. What are you talking about? No, they weren't at all. There are no expectations, ever. - Thank you. - I mean, look at Regina. She's been here for, I think, a few months and has only said a couple of words, so. Everybody's at their own pace. So, I will see you Sunday, right? Paintbrush in-hand. Hey, I'll keep my distance then. I noticed... that you didn't share. Sorry? I don't mean to assume... Have you also lost someone? I mean... Yeah, I mean... You know what, you don't need to answer that. I should not have asked you that. It's okay. No, it's totally okay, all right? It's just, as the leader, I like to put my focus on everyone else. But listen, I've got to lock up. I'm glad you came tonight again. Goodnight, okay? Yeah. - I'll see you Sunday? - Yeah. All right! Trace? Picked you up some morning motivation! Peppermint mocha! How are you so joyful so early in the morning? "Joy"... it's right there in my name! - Hi. - Hi. Oh! Oh, no, no, no, no. It's not there yet, it's not, but at least I was able to get some work done after last night. Oh! After the group, right? How was that? You know what, it... it wasn't horrible, actually. I mean, I don't know how much I'll share, if at all, but it was kind of nice being around people who understood what I was going through. I know, I know. You were right. It seems to be having a positive effect on your art. I mean, look... You've gone from half-paintings to three-fourths of paintings! I think that's called deadline anxiety. Have you landed on a theme? - Ready for it? - Mm-hmm. "Christmas"! I'm gonna need a little more than that for the promotional materials. I'll keep working on it. Okay, well, I'll let you be. Remember, the artists' meet and greet is next week. Talking about what you're planning to present will really help generate some buzz. Greg used to do that. Hey... you're not gonna be alone up there. I'll be right next to you if you need me. Thank you. I'm gonna work for a few more hours, and then I'm gonna meet Michael at the youth center. Michael? Uh, he leads the support group, and we're... We're volunteering at the youth center today. Great. Oh, wait... He's the guy, the one from the market, with the ornament. The handsome one who got all shy around you like a boy with a crush? I think we're remembering that moment differently, but yes. Mm-hmm. What are the odds you'd bump into him at the market? Maybe that divine meeting was just meant to be. I don't know that I really believe that anything is "meant to be" anymore. But you know what I do believe in? Hmm? - Coffee. - Coffee! - Coffee. - Coffee. ♪ Come and behold Him ♪ ♪ Born the King of Angels ♪ ♪ O, come let us adore Him... ♪ ♪ O, come let us adore Him ♪ ♪ O, come let us adore Him... ♪ ♪ Christ the Lord ♪ Amazing, guys! Yes! Yes! Take five, guys. I appreciate that. Thank you, thank you. All right. Regina! Hey! Hi. Any chance we'll see you back up here one of these Sundays, or? Maybe. The choir isn't the same without you. I miss you. We miss you! And I know she would love to hear you up there again, too. I'll... I'll see you soon. Hey... All right, y'all. Round two! Hello, Michael! Denise, hey! Merry Christmas. So, listen, I've got clothes, I've got books, I've got toys galore. Well, on behalf of me and the kids, it's always very much appreciated. Well, I appreciate you. Um, I've got to get all of these boxes in there before the group arrives, so. - Hey. - Yeah? I'm a little worried about you. Yeah, I'm doing fine. I'm fine. No. I'm just trying to help out wherever there's a need. Just like Melody did. I've known you and Melody for years now, so I think I can say this... It seems like you're trying to atone for something you had no control over. Denise, I don't know what else to do. Okay? I know this isn't going to bring her back, but it definitely eases the guilt. You have nothing to feel guilty about. Well, listen... would you mind helping me finish all these? ♪ Feel the magic once again ♪ ♪ It's coming, it's coming ♪ ♪ Christmas ♪ ♪ Gather family Bring your friends... ♪ - You're getting a workout. - Tell me about it. Makes up for all those weeks I skipped leg day. Hey, tell you what... Why don't you and I do some face painting? And then we give Conductor Michael here a little bit of a break. What do you think? All right. All right, come on. One, two, three... Oh! All right, so here's the deal. The key is you just have to sit super still... Cookies! There she goes. There goes my subject. Well, you know what, I'll be your muse. - Yeah? - Yeah. - Here we go... - All right. Are you ready for this? Yeah. Make me pretty. All right... - Okay. - Okay. You know, you're really good with kids. How can you not love them? They inspire me to have "child-like faith". I guess you're right. All right. This might truly be my best work yet. Really? - I mean... yes. - Drumroll. Pretty amazing. Ta-dah! Oh! Wow! Oh, no. I'm not done. I'm going into Vogue. I'm not done! Here we go! Now you're done. Oh, that's... Guys, come look at Conductor Michael! I mean, look at this. - Rudolph the Reindeer! - Rudolph the Reindeer! Rudolph the Reindeer! Those kids had a blast! I think the more exhausted we were, the more fun they had. That's a good way of putting it. I'm spent. Listen, guys, I want to thank you for your hard work today. It was such a special, special day. Good job. Do you want me to put it over here? No, let's just put all the stuff down here. The doctor said not to worry. You've got the best care in the world. How are you? Always putting others first. I love your big, beautiful heart. At least that's one part of me that's still in good shape. I'm gonna be home before you know it. We're gonna be painting... eating too many Christmas cookies. Singing in church... Front row? Best seats in the house. Yeah. "Best seats in the house." - Hey, Trace! - Hi! December 15th! Don't remind me. The gallery is neigh. Don't you mean "nigh"? I like "neigh," like the reindeer would say. 'Tis the season, right? Thank you! Got a front-page ad for your exhibit! Oh, man. And top billing on the gallery invite. "Traci Fremont returns for a holiday surprise." You're a genius. It'll add intrigue, and give you more time to pick a theme. Now, don't forget, meet and greet is on Thursday. Think you could have it figured out by then? Traci Fremont's Return... Is Neigh." - Yeah. - I'll keep working on it. Okay. Oh... it all looks so good. How much for one of everything? Traci? After all your stories, I feel like I'm visiting a historical landmark. Yeah. Well, in a way, it kind of is one. Are you headed to group soon? Yeah. I just gotta put some stuff away. Did you... Did you wanna walk together? I would love that. Cool. Ooh, one last thing. Compliments of the chef. How can I resist? Let me see... Maybe this. Best choice. - Yeah! - Yeah. Mm... Mm! Wait, is this chocolate inside a chocolate donut with chocolate frosting and chocolate sprinkles? Oh, yeah! That is Nai Nai's quadruple chocolate donut. It's about a week's worth of calories. Worth it. That's what they say. Now... has your dad tried this? He... won't even set foot in here. I think if your dad could see, or, rather, taste, how talented you are... he'd be more supportive. Right. But... that would just require us to have a conversation first. I'll be right back. For sure... Um... I'll see you in there. Oh, do you mind taking this? Thanks. "The Best Seats in the House". Hey. Hey! I'm sorry, what was that? That's what Greg always called the front row... "The Best Seats in the House". Oh, right. Well... he definitely wasn't wrong. I'm sorry, I'm interrupting... No, no, no, no. No. You're not interrupting at all, actually. I just... I always come here early to pray for the group, so. Any requests? Where does one begin? You know, I have a... - a deadline... - Hmm. And no idea what to present. So... a miracle? A miracle it is. Do you ever wonder if it... if it doesn't work? Hmm. You know, I think... I think a small degree of doubt is normal. But I also believe that God answers prayers sometimes in ways we don't expect. Hmm. I stopped praying. When I lost him. It just... feels so wrong to say that. Hey, hey, hey... it's not. It's normal. It's honest. And it's honest. Yes. I hope I wasn't being rude whenever I asked you if you had lost someone. No. No, you weren't rude at all. It's okay. The truth is... I have lost someone. - I'm really sorry. - That's okay. We don't have to talk about it. Honestly, I... I couldn't really help you anyway. I mean, my faith is not exactly sturdy, so. Well, in that case... You know, God says all you need is to have faith the size of a mustard seed. I have a feeling you have that much. Why do you think things like this happen? I think it's a reminder. To always live each day to the fullest, but also I think it's a way for Him to show us... how He restores and heals us. And all we have to do is pray. Great photos, guys. I really love seeing what you did here. I think I'm ready to share. Okay. Um... my husband, Greg, and I met six years ago in art class. My parents said that we were a "match made in heaven". So, we got married, and I felt like God gave me everything I could have ever wanted. Yeah. Until I lost it all. Greg had a brain tumor. The doctors tried, but... I miss him every day. You know, Traci, that takes... a lot of courage to open up like that. I hope you believe me when I say this... that's what healing looks like. Can we pray for you? Yeah. Yeah. Heavenly Father, I want to thank you... for a wonderful day. But also for a day where you showed us that, even within our grief, we can find joy. As we leave this place today, bless us... and comfort us. I don't think I can do this. Just be yourself! You really want me to do that? I haven't finished my art, I don't have a theme, and I clam up when talking in front of people. Your art will be finished, you can tease them with the element of surprise, and, most importantly, you're here. Okay? You'll be fine. Ladies and gentlemen, may I have your attention, please? Thank you for coming to the pre-gallery artist meet and greet! Let's start with our very own Traci Fremont! Hey, everyone. Um, it's good to see you again. You may have noticed I'm here solo. Two years ago, I lost my husband, Greg. Now he would, you know, probably warm you all up with a really great joke. I don't have one of those in my pocket. To be honest, it has just been... it's hard. It's been really hard. When you feel like half of you is missing, how do you move forward? You know? So... you are going to see a new version of the Fremont series this year. One of... resilience... and healing. And it's probably going to be messy, because that's life... but I really do believe that that's where true beauty is found. So I hope you come and check out my exhibit. Thank you. What. Was. That. I don't know what came over me, it just kinda spilled out. And it was amazing! - Really? - Yes! The perfect way to channel your feelings into your work! You hit a home run. I almost ran out of here. You managed to pull it together. It was a Christmas miracle, perhaps? Whatever it was, it worked. It was the support group, wasn't it? I knew it! I'm always right! Calm down. You're giving yourself just a little bit too much credit. Oh, I don't know. I think someone is looking out for you. ♪ See Him in a manger lay ♪ ♪ Whom the choirs of angels praise ♪ ♪ Mary, Joseph lend your aid ♪ ♪ While our hearts in love we raise ♪ ♪ Come adore on bended knee ♪ ♪ Christ the Lord the newborn King ♪ Hi, sweetie. - Hi! - Hi! Wow! Who did you hire to make this place all sparkly and shiny? Well, I did it all by myself. With the help of five to six cups of coffee. Well, we brought you some sweets to fuel your work. Oh! Just keep them away from your father. Mm-hmm. Hey, I had a carrot yesterday! And it wasn't even in a cake. Oh. Well, I'm very proud of you. Huh. Something tells me that you guys didn't just stop by to give me some sweets. We heard about your support group. Ah, Joyce. We think it's wonderful that you're getting yourself back out there, and we want to hear all about it! Who's this Michael fella anyway? Okay, Dad. He's just a friend. Friends are good. Yes... friends have been really good. - Hey! - Hey! This was on your door. Thank you! So much. Well, this is interesting. What? A text from Michael. He says, "Meet me in front of the church tomorrow at 5:00 a.m. And dress warm!" Thank you. Winky face. Winky face, huh? Yeah... It's to the whole group. Well, I wonder what he has planned. It better be good. 5:00 a.m.? What's his story anyway? I don't know. He hasn't told me it, but I'm sure he will when he's ready. Good Morning, everyone! Who's ready for a winter wonderland adventure? I'm ready for a nap. I second that. - Yeah? - Yeah. - Here you go. - Lifesaver. Let me guess, you're not a morning person? I'm about to be. All right, I am your tour guide this morning as we head to a very special location. Thank you. All aboard! - You're in? - Yeah. Groovy. I know it's early and it's dark outside, guys, but trust me, if you look outside the window, you'll see this gorgeous... Okay. Night-night, guys. How about you? You still awake? You all right? Yeah... yeah. Just thinking. Well, I'll tell you what... I bet I can make you laugh by the end of this trip. What are the stakes? Ooh. Okay. You drive a hard bargain there, Traci. The stakes are... the loser buys the winner a dozen sweet treats of their choice from Nai Nai's bakery. What do you think? Deal. You're on. Well, we're almost there, you guys. Hey, listen, I want to discuss this week's theme. "Finding Peace". What better way to experience that than in nature, right? What's our task? You don't have a task, Ethel. As a matter of fact, none of you do. All I want you to do... stay in the moment. If you have a memory or thought, let it be there, make room for it. That's it. Okay. Yeah, now I see why you got us up here so early. Right? This is where I feel closest to God. Right here. The stillness, the quiet... the closer proximity to Heaven. It's a place you can look out and see something bigger than yourself. ♪ Go tell it on the mountain ♪ ♪ Over the hills and everywhere ♪ ♪ Go tell it on the mountain... ♪ Can I tell you about my mom? ♪ Go tell it on the mountain... ♪ She was the lead singer at church. ♪ Over the hills and everywhere... ♪ Had the most soulful voice you've ever heard. ♪ Go tell it on the mountain ♪ ♪ That Jesus Christ is born ♪ ♪ While shepherds kept their watch... ♪ And it wasn't just her voice that was powerful... ♪ O'er silent flocks by night... ♪ it was her spirit. ♪ Behold throughout the heavens ♪ ♪ There shone a holy light ♪ ♪ Go tell it on the mountain ♪ ♪ Over the hills and everywhere ♪ ♪ Go tell it on the mountain ♪ ♪ That Jesus Christ is born ♪ Music was everything to us. I lost her only a couple of months ago. My mother, my singing partner... and... when I lost her, I... also lost my voice. But now, it's... it's like she's here. I love you. That was beautiful. Regina... you okay? Yeah, I'm okay. Um... I think I'm ready to go back down now. - Thank you for sharing. - Yeah, thanks. I'm proud of you. Wow. She's come so far. You helped make that happen. Speaking of help... You okay? No, my back... getting old here. Think you could carry me down to the... I got you! - No! - No, no! I got you. You owe me. - That does not count. - Of course, it counts. Made you laugh. Like I told you I would. Tricky. Fine! Oh! And trust me, I'm not going to have you get me any treats, or anything like that. Instead, I... Instead... you know, I didn't know if you might want to... might want to be my partner at the... gift-wrapping contest. Like, a date? Uh... yeah, I mean, I don't know... Well, yeah, I could call it a date, or... or not, or... Can I think about it? Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Okay, I'm gonna just... - catch up. - Okay. Everything okay, honey? Yeah, yeah. Why? Well, you've been twirling that same piece of spaghetti for 10 minutes. Michael asked me on a date. I mean, I think it was a date. I don't know... That's great! Great? From what we've heard, he's an upstanding man. He is. He's a really nice guy. But... what about Greg? So, what, am I just supposed to forget him and move on? I don't think I can do that. No one's asking you to forget about Greg. But he... he would want you to be happy, no matter what. Yes. I know that you are afraid to open your heart again. But if there's a little part of you that thinks maybe it's time to try... maybe that's what you should do. One small step... or a date... at a time. You still need a partner? Oh, hey. Yeah, I would... I would love one. So, what was your plan if I didn't show? My plan was, I was gonna use each hand to wrap each one of these presents separately, and then I thought, you know, that's not good... But anyway, I thought it might work, but obviously, it's not. Now, listen, I knew you were gonna come. I knew you'd show up. It's nice to see you laugh. - So we're wrapping this? - Yes. How does one wrap a bicycle without it looking ridiculous? Well, you know, it's an art form. Don't worry. You'll catch on. Just follow my lead. All right wrappers, are you ready? - Yes! - Yes! Time is important, but aesthetic is key. These gifts will be donated to the homeless shelter, but our winners will not go away empty-handed, because you're playing for... an all-expense-paid ski trip to Murray's Lodge! - Whoa! - What? Nice, huh? Don't worry, when we win, we'll go as friends. When we win? - Really? - I like your confidence. Well... On your mark... - Ready? - All right.

Well, because they were much faster than us, come on. Don't feel bad for those two. Come on, they've won it the last 30 years in a row. - What? - Yeah. Yeah. Not to mention, I think... they're a little too proud, by the way. Thanks for coming by the way. I probably should be working, but I'm... I'm really glad I came. It was fun. - Yeah, it was, wasn't it? - Yeah! What do you say we procrastinate a little longer? I'd say I'd love that. It's a different kind of beautiful at night, huh? Melody loved coming down here... at night and looking up at the stars. Can I tell you about her? Are you kidding? I've been waiting weeks for this moment. Please. Overpack for the hike? Uh, yeah, yeah. Yeah, that would... That would be an understatement, wouldn't it? I've seen a lot of first-timers make the same mistake. Well, the funny thing is, I think I brought everything, I just think I forgot... Water? Yeah. I have an extra one. - Really? - Yeah. - Thank you so much. - Take it. Really? Thank you. I think you just saved my life. So, do you... you come here often? I do. It's my happy place. I like to pray as I look over the view. Well, it definitely is a stunning view, isn't it? It is. Listen... I'm Michael, by the way. Oh, I'm Melody. - Nice to meet you. - Nice to meet you. So what do you... what do you pray about? - Today? - Yeah. The kids at the youth center. Oh. Every year, I deliver gifts to make their spirits bright. That's... Oh, no, you're Santa Claus! You are! You know, I've been wanting to meet you ever since I was a kid. I've got to get your autograph? Do you have a... do I have a pen? I've packed everything else. You know, the season's all about giving back. Plus, giving is my "love language". Hmm. I like that. I think mine's pizza. Funny guy. I try. No, seriously, that's very admirable of you. Thank you. I've been blessed with a lot, so... I make it a habit of blessing others. Well, you certainly blessed me. You know what, I'm glad we met. Call this a happy coincidence. I don't believe in coincidences. Okay... okay. You know, after the accident, they... they found this ornament in her car. It was a gazebo, just like this. And attached to it was a note. It said "To Michael. Merry Christmas." I tell you, Traci... If she didn't go and buy that gazebo for me, I swear she'd still be here today. Michael, you can't think like that. No. I do think like that. Every single day. It's like I can't let it go. Look at me... How sad is this? Here I am, a leader of a grief-support group. It's better than... acting like everything's okay. - Yeah. - Yeah. Oh... not to make matters worse, but when I opened the box... the ornament was broken. Maybe I can fix it. If you want. Wow. I can tell you really know your way around a canvas, huh? I am... impressed. That's the... that's the last painting we did together. It's what we think Heaven looks like. And it's immune to criticism, because... it's up to interpretation, right? Right. Wow. This is beautiful, huh? May I? Yeah. You're not so bad. Well, well. Greg was always the... Anyway... here you go. It still has some tiny cracks, but I think it's part of the charm. You know, it shows that... things that are broken can be made, you know, somewhat whole again. It's perfect. Thank you. Of course. So you never learned how to play? No... Okay, one song. - Okay. - Just one. - All right. - All right. I'll give it a shot. That's great! - That's right. - That's good! That's really good. We make a great team. That's true. Um... I... I think I should go. - It's getting late. - It is getting late, yeah. But... thank you... for this. Goodnight, Traci. Thank you. Yeah, goodnight. You know, as much as I love having a newly-minted expert wrapper helping me with these, shouldn't you be getting back to work? The gallery is in two days. I'm merrily procrastinating. And un-merrily starting to lose confidence in myself. If your goal is... trying to get people to feel something, maybe you should draw on what you're feeling right now. Well, it's a real mixed bag, Mom. Honestly, my... my heart is just so conflicted. You have grown so much since you joined that group. Maybe the final piece of this puzzle is... opening your heart. And that doesn't mean that you have to forget about Greg. Maybe drawing on the memories of him will help you. God, I feel lost... and I don't know what to do. I pray... that I am able to help people feel something special for Christmas. Amen. All right, I've got you. Well, being home sure beats that hospital room any day. The doctor is one phone call away, I will be with you 24/7, and... your only job is to rest, okay? Dance with me. Did you not just hear what I told you? Come on. After all, we never know how much time we have left, so we have to live each moment like it's our last. We are going to have so many of these moments. Decades more. Traci, I need you to promise me something. Anything. Never stop laughing, and never stop loving. And never stop living. Okay? ♪ The world waits for a miracle ♪ ♪ Oh, come... ♪ ♪ Emmanuel ♪ Traci! Come in! Thank you! What are you doing here? And what are you wearing? I know I look ridiculous, but they said they also need an elf. What are you talking about? The Christmas market needs a Mrs. Claus, and I told them I know someone with years of experience. Maybe all you need to do is take one step. Just try it on, see if it fits? Okay... Okay! It fits like a glove. You are rocking that! But I don't think I can do this on my own. Well, you'll have your trusty elf right by your side. I'll be with you in just a sec. Nothing's changed a bit. Dad... What are you doing here? A friend of yours left a box of Nai Nai's sweets at my doorstep. It's been so long since I've tried them... but I'm glad I did. You made them? I did. They taste just like hers. So why'd you ask me to meet you here? I just wanted to celebrate your courage for sharing the other day. How does it feel? Like my soul is healing. I know she's still with me. You know... open mic's about to start. And I just so happened... to reserve the first slot. You wanna give it a shot? I think I can do it. I came to apologize. No. Whoa. No, no. You don't... You don't have to do that, Dad. It was a hard time for all of us, and we all grieve differently. I was angry, and I took it out on you. It wasn't fair... and I'm sorry. If my mother taught me anything at all, it is that there is nothing more important in life than family.

I just have... one more thing left to do. Hey. Hey. Happy Anniversary. Traci... what are you doing here? Well, I thought it was strange that you weren't returning any of my calls. Right. And then I remembered... that it was December 23rd. Yeah. The day we first met... and the day we got married. I hope I'm not intruding. I just wanted to make sure you were okay. No, no, no. Not intruding at all. - Okay. - Thank you. Yeah. You know what... I'm okay. Every year, I bring a flower up here to remember her. Listen, Traci, about the other night... No, no, no. We do not need to talk about that. Today is about you and Melody. I was sitting here, and I was thinking... I am so grateful for all the years that we spent together... and from now on, that's... that's what I vow to hold on to. It's hard. It's really hard. For some reason, this year, I just... I don't know, I just feel... more at peace. Sounds like healing to me. - Yeah. - Yeah. That's incredible. That's incredible, isn't it? I mean, we have made a ton of progress these past few weeks. I have a feeling you're talking about more than just the tree. Um, well, your feeling's correct, I am. So, what do you say we get started? Is Traci coming? Actually, I don't think so. I think she's really busy with her art show. - I should have canceled... - Sorry I'm late! - Hey! - Hi! - Merry Christmas! - Merry Christmas! Merry Christmas! I waited until the last possible minute to invite you to this... But it's probably because I waited till the last possible minute to finish my art. Your gallery exhibit? Tonight? Yes! And I would love for you to stop by, if you can, no pressure. - But there will be cookies. - I'm there. - Me too! - You had me at "cookies". I wouldn't miss it. I wouldn't. We're all going. We're there. So, while we're all here, why don't I open things up? Yeah, actually... What? Can I open things up tonight? - Yeah. - Yeah. I'd be honored. Okay. Okay. I'm a little rusty, but here we go. Dear God... in the last two years, I've... often thought that my prayers weren't being answered... and now I know that they were answered... just not in the way I expected. You led me to this group. Thank you so much for the gift of new friendships. And I ask you, God, just to bless every person... in this group tonight... and continue to heal us... with Your peace, love, and joy. Amen. Amen! You weren't rusty at all! Thank you. I learned from the best. Best seats in the house. Hi, everyone! Merry Christmas. Merry Christmas! As many of you know, the last couple of years have been... really hard. I, um... almost gave up on my art completely. But that would have been taking the easy way out. So I decided to take the hard road... and open my heart, and the creativity followed. That never... would have been possible without the love and support of my Mom and Dad, and my friends... who are all here tonight. Each and every one of you inspired me to seek hope... and love... and joy... even in life's toughest moments. This is dedicated to them. Now I would love to present... "Hearts of Healing". Look, I'm wearing my Mrs. Claus outfit! - And there's little Presley! - Adorable! Is that the quadruple-chocolate donut? It is! I want to thank you all for joining us tonight. The theme for this year's Christmas Eve service is "Holding on while letting go". Now, I'm sure there's some of you here that have lost someone close to you... and I urge you to look around and realize that you're not alone. By lighting these balloons, we signify that the ones that we've lost in our lives will always remain... in our hearts. But before we do, I'd like to take a moment. I'd like all of us to... say a prayer, recall a memory... hold them in your heart. Now... as we release these balloons into the sky, I'd like all of us to celebrate them... as we let them go. Are you ready? - Yes. - Yeah. Whoo...
