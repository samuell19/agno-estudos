[♪] Narrator: It all started when they were just 20 years old. Corrine was getting ready for a campus-wide Christmas fundraiser in the courtyard, and Rob was taking photos for the school paper. He had never seen someone so beautiful. Rob went over to introduce himself, and from the moment they shook hands, it felt like they had known each other their whole lives. It wasn't long before they were spending every waking moment together. She loved him almost immediately, and although it took him a bit longer to say it, he did, too. They were complete opposites. Rob the realistic and Corrine the romantic, but it didn't matter. The next two years were what could only be described as a whirlwind romance. So magical and pure, it was like something out of a fairy tale. The kind of love people wait a lifetime for. Maybe they were just young and nalve, or perhaps simply confident in what they had, but one thing was for sure, they thought they were going to be together forever. [♪] -Hey! -Hey you! Happy Christmas Eve. It's so weird being on campus while it's so empty. It's not totally empty, not totally empty. I saw Professor Hams over at Woosley Hall making a snow angel. What? Are you serious? No, I'm joking. You are such an oaf. An oaf, that's a new one. Yeah, you know, moron. Yeah, I, I got it, no need to clarify. Well, did I mention a very handsome oaf? Ah, now see, that's more like it. So, are you gonna invite me to sit or what? Oh yeah, for sure, right here, right there. -Thank you. -You're welcome. It's so beautiful, isn't it? [♪] Yes, it is gorgeous. There's just something so magical about Christmas. Oh, I wish you could spend Christmas Day with my family tomorrow. -Yeah. -One Christmas with my dad can turn the biggest grinch into Buddy the Elf. Oh, and he makes the best snowman pancakes. Sorry to say, but I'm a waffle guy. No, I wish I could have spent Christmas with you and your family, but next Christmas, it's you and me. Okay. Well, what did you get me? Already right to the presents? Well, last year you got me jumper cables, so clearly I'm not in this for the lavish gifts. Yes, but in my defense, I didn't want you to ever be stranded without them. Plus, I think it's actually a romantic gesture. Really? -If you think about. -Okay, so what did you get me this year, window washing fluid? [laughing] -All right. -Okay. Oh, wait, what is this? It's nothing, -just put it here. -Wait! Rob, you got into a photography workshop in Italy? Why didn't you tell me? Because it's not a big deal, and it's not like I'm going, anyway. Here. Wait, what, why not? Because it's two years in Italy, like, I'm not gonna leave you. Are you kidding me? Wait, so you're not going because of me? No, I'm not going because I want to be here with you. I love you and I want to be with you here. No, Rob, you have to go. Corrine, come on. No, I'm serious, you can't not go because of me. It's not that simple. I could never forgive myself if I stood in the way of an amazing opportunity like this. Okay, then come with me. To Italy? -Yeah. -Well, I still have to finish my degree. I, I, I can't just leave you. Well, what about long distance? For two years? Yeah, you're right, that never works. Well, maybe we're too young to be so serious. Wait, are you saying you want to break up? No, of course I don't want to break up. Okay, then what are you saying? I don't know. [♪] I have an idea. Okay, what is it? So, there is an old wives' tale that in the 1950s, a young shoemaker was so in love with a beautiful young English professor here, that he made all the ornaments for this tree for her, handcrafted. I guess Christmas was her favorite time of year. Okay. And every year he created a new pair of ornaments to prove that his love was everlasting. And then, after five whole years, she was so in awe that he never gave up, that they got married. Isn't that romantic? Apparently, they donated all the ornaments to this school, so they can put it on this tree every year, claiming each piece was proof of their true love. Can you hoist me up? Yeah, yeah, yeah. -Okay. -On three. Two, one. Oh, that was easier than I thought it would be. Well that's because we make a good team. Look, this says to my Honey Bee, love Bernard. -His name was Bernard. -Who? The shoemaker. Put me down. [♪] What are you doing? Just hold on. [♪] This contract hereby states that Corrine Jane Millbrook and Robert Edward Walker will lovingly part ways for the next two years. Not until Robert is finished in Italy will they reunite to this very spot on Christmas Eve at midnight to decide if what they have is true love. -Are you serious? -What do you think? I, I think it's crazy. I mean two years is a lifetime from now. Well, Bernard waited five years. But we don't even know -if Bernard is real. -I think he is. I mean what if only one of us shows up? -This is ridiculous. -Then we weren't meant to be. Just like my dad says, true love always finds its way. Corrine, this isn't a game. Okay, we could lose each other forever. Rob, you deserve to have that amazing experience in Italy. It's just two years. [♪] You want to sign it? [♪] What, what are you doing? Why did you do that? We each need to bring our halves back in two years, this spot on Christmas Eve. Why? To show that we never let go of one another. Crazy, do you know that? [♪] I'm gonna miss you. I'm gonna miss you, too. [♪] So are you gonna meet me back here in two years? Deal? Deal. [♪] Merry Christmas, Rob. I love you. I love you, too, Corrine. Merry Christmas. [♪] [♪] Ha, good morning, good morning! Sam and Aunty Bennet, Silicon Valley gods. They developed Attica Inc., which has invested in every major app out there. Uber, Twitter, Snapchat, you name it. They are practically royalty. Give me a little credit, I know who they are. Well, they are renewing their vows on Christmas Eve. Turns out Nancy always wanted a Christmas wedding, but they were too young and poor to do it at the time, so they went to City Hall. But now, they are making up for lost time, and it is going to be fabulous. It is going to be the party of the year. Okay. There is no better person to plan this than you. You know that, I know that, you are my best event planner, and I don't trust anyone else to pull this off the way I know you can. Okay, I appreciate that, but you do know Christmas Eve is two weeks away. That's insane! The person who pulls this off has to have literally no personal life. Okay, hold on now. I already contacted their people and sent them your portfolio. They were thinking of going with Meridian. But guess what, they like what they saw, and they are considering you. They could be one of our biggest clients ever. Well you already sent them my portfolio? They are billionaires. Well if this is so important, why aren't you heading it? Are you kidding? David would kill me if I worked all the way up until the night of Christmas Eve. I don't know, Victor. Look, I know Christmas isn't really your thing anymore, okay, and I don't know why. It's none of my business. But this could be huge for the company. Okay, I'll do it. -Really? -Yes, under one condition. -Oh-oh. -If I pull this off, I want to be partner. Partner? Yes. I have been here for six years, and I work harder than anyone here. I brought you loyal clients, good press, and quite frankly, a ton of money. Because of me, you have an indoor pool. Corrine, you know how much I value your hard work, but the only partner I have or want is David, and on most days I want to throw him into that indoor pool. So, I'm sorry, but it's a no. Okay, well I guess Meridian is just gonna have to enjoy their new client. You know, I heard that they are billionaires. You are ballsy, Millbrook. Well, I learnt from the best. This has better be the most magnificent Christmas wedding ever, that even Santa and Mrs. Claus want a redo, do you hear me? -I hear you! -I am talking perfection! Perfection! [♪] You are gonna make partner? That's the plan. Now I just actually need them to hire me first. Well, when will you find out? Oh, soon, they told me they will give me a call as soon as they have made the decision. Oh, they would be crazy not to hire you. Oh, time will tell. Hey, so tell me, how did things go with that guy? What was his name again, Jack? Jake. It was okay. I mean he was nice. I just didn't feel that connection you're supposed to feel, you know. Well you can't expect to feel magic on the first date. Maybe you'd feel it on the second, or the third. And is that how it happened with you and Matthew? Well, no, we hit it off right away. Exactly. It's just like dad used to say, you can't force true love. You either feel or you don't. When was the last time you talked to mom? Oh, I called her on my lunch break. I let her know I wouldn't be making it home until Christmas Day if I close this deal. Well, as long as we're all together on Christmas Day, that's all that matters. Dad will be so happy to see you. Well, it looks like I need to get ready for my meeting tomorrow. So, I'm gonna talk to you soon, okay? Okay. -Let me know how it goes. -Okay. -Good luck. -Thank you. Thank you so much for seeing us last minute. Oh, of course, thank you. It's such a pleasure to meet you both. Well, listen, we took a look at your portfolio last night, and I must say we were very impressed. Yeah, we saw that you led the charge on last year's Google Halloween party. We were actually there, and what a spectacular event that was. How big was your team for that? Oh, it was just me and two junior assistants. Honestly, I prefer to take on most of the workload myself. I like to make sure all of my events are exactly how my clients envision it. Well, let me just cut right to the chase, how would you like to be our wedding planner? Really? Wow, I would love nothing more. Wonderful. We plan to make this quite the affair, so it's gonna take someone special to pull it off in just two weeks. And I will make sure it is as perfect as it possibly can be. We should also mention a photojournalist will be trailing us from Newly Nuptials Magazine. He's documenting the entire two weeks for a future article, so I hope you don't mind having your photo taken. Oh, no, of course not, I actually love having my picture taken, and I love that magazine. Well, fantastic. We'll purchase your flight and we'll have a car waiting for you when you land, and they'll take you to the lodge. I'm sorry, the lodge? Are you two not doing your renewal in San Francisco? Oh no, no, didn't your boss tell you? We always spend Christmas in Connecticut. We rented out a whole retreat center to host the wedding. It's so beautiful. It's so, it's so tranquil. You'll love it. Connecticut, wow. Is that okay? Oh no, yes, that is okay. It's actually where I went to college. Oh, fantastic, great. We'll send the ticket over tonight. I wish that we could all fly together, but Sam and I have to go early to get the rooms ready. In fact, our flight leaves in four hours, so we better get going. Oh, you better get going. Thank you so much, and I cannot wait to get started. This is going to be marvelous. We'll see you soon. All right, see you. [♪] Christmas in Connecticut. [♪] Wow! Hello, hello. Oh, Corrine, you made it. How was your flight? No crying babies, I hope. No, just the loud snoring man beside me. Well, now you know that it's been like for me for the past 35 years. Oh, you guys, this place is amazing! And it will be even more amazing once we get decorating. I want this place to be just bursting with Christmas cheer. Well, let's get you -settled in your room. -Good idea. We want you to be well rested, so we can start planning tomorrow morning. Okay. Oh, perfect timing! This is our photographer, Robert Walker. Rob? Corrine? What are you, I mean hi. Do you two know each other? Yeah, ah, well we, um. We, we met at college. Wow, that's such a fun coincidence. Yeah, so fun. Well, Rob is gonna be here for over the next two weeks documenting every single moment with his camera. It's gonna be a gas. Have you seen his work? It's absolutely breathtaking. I haven't seen it in a very long time. Well, you two are gonna be spending a lot of time together. So by the time Christmas Eve rolls around, you're gonna be like an old married couple. Just like us. Let me get your suitcase up to your room. Oh, Rob, I'll give you a room key. You're right next to Corrine. Oh. Huh. Well. -Well. -This is unexpected. Very, huh, but... You look well. Thanks, thanks, I, I feel, I feel well, I feel well. Good, good, good. You look well, too. I mean you look nice and healthy and... Healthy? I didn't mean healthy, like, healthy, I meant healthy like you look. Not sick, healthy. Thank you, I guess. I try to have a kale smoothie every morning. It's working. I, I can, I did, I see it, I see the antioxidants. Okay, well, it's been a long day of travel, so. Yeah, me, too, it's, it's late for me. Okay, good talk. Yeah, yeah. Rob is the photographer? You should have seen his face. He looked like he saw a ghost. Oh, come on, give him a break. He was probably in shock. I mean when was the last time you two even saw each other, anyways. Seven years ago, remember. Of course. If I could, I would run over there and smack him for what he did to you. Well, it was a long time ago. I still don't understand why he didn't show up to the tree. Well, obviously he moved on, or, or he just forget. Either way, he's in the past. So you don't want to know why he didn't show? No, no, the last thing I need right now is a distraction. Sam and Nancy's wedding is make or break for me. It'll be fine. You're both adults. Yeah. And it's not like you're still in love with him or something, right? Exactly. [♪] Totally over it. [♪] ♪] Corrine, good morning! Hi. Coffee? Sure, thank you. How'd you sleep? I haven't slept that well since I was a kid. That's wonderful. Robert here said the same thing. Perfect. So, what's the game plan? We're eager to get started. Oh, and there is an adorable Christmas store here that we must go to today for decorations. Oh, great. Actually, I created a schedule for the next two weeks that shows us everything that we need to get done. It's important that we follow it, gonna make sure we don't fall behind. Wow, so organized, I'm impressed. This is perfect. I knew we hired the right one. Well, first things first, we need to focus on finding your dress. With the wedding being only two weeks away, it's really important we find it asap. There is an amazing bridal boutique here. The seamstress is the best in town, maybe even in the state, but she's almost always booked up. It's impossible to get an appointment. Oh, no, you don't worry about that, I will get us in there. I have the power of persuasion. Oh, fantastic. And what's next? Well, next we have to decide on our colour scheme, that way we can build everything around that, so to make sure nothing clashes. What if we went traditional, red and green? Sure, we can do that. Oh, no, I hate to impose. I don't know, I just, I was thinking more like a, like a red and white would be better, or even a champagne gold and red. I mean it'll really make the, the photos, mwah. I love that idea. Oh, we could do gold sparkling lights with -red flowers everywhere. -Yeah, yeah. That would be beautiful. Well, it is your day, so if you would like to do red and green, I'm pretty sure Robert here can still make your pictures beautiful. I can and they will be. You know what, I love Rob's idea. Let's do red and gold. There you go. I couldn't -agree more. -There we go. That's a nice thought, Rob. Thanks, that's what I do. [♪] [footsteps] What are you doing? What do you mean? I'm, I'm putting my camera away. Why didn't you just tell them that you liked red and green? That's what they wanted. Come on, red and green, it's a little cheesy, man. Well, maybe they like cheesy. What does it matter? Our job is to make them happy, and they are happy. All right, just because you're the queen of Christmas, doesn't mean that you're always going to be right. I am hardly the queen of Christmas. In fact, I can't wait for this whole holiday to be over. You're joking. Do I look like I'm joking? Just, I mean Christmas used to be your favorite. After Halloween, your dorm room would look like Whoville. Look, let's just stay out of each other's way, okay. I'll stay in my lane if you stay in yours. Fine. Okay, what do you say, guys? Isn't this fun? So much fun! Yeah, having a blast. To the Christmas shop we go. Shotgun! After you, queen of Christmas. [♪ O Little Town of Bethlehem ♪] Wow, this is beautiful! Isn't it something? Yeah, it really is something, it's amazing. Welcome. Oh, hi there. How's business. Hectic. Who knew a Christmas shop would be so busy at Christmastime. We do live in a strange world. Are you looking for anything specific today? Well, actually, my husband and I have decided last minute to renew our vows on Christmas Eve. We never had a real wedding, so we're gonna do it up big Christmas style. We might end up buying out your entire store. Music to my ears! That is delightful, congratulations. -Thank you. -Thank you. Well, I'll leave you to it. Let me know if I can help with anything. Yeah, we will. Shall we get started? Let's do this. Oh, my gosh, look at this. Oh, I love him. Beauty. [♪ Jingle Bells ] I think that's beautiful, -absolutely. -Okay, great. [♪ Jingle Bells ] Look at this little guy. [♪ Jingle Bells ] Hey, Nancy, want to get married. Hey, Nancy. That's creepy. [♪ Jingle Bells ] Anything else? Oh, here is my basket. I got it, I got it. -Oh, okay, wait. -Thank you. -I got you, I got you. -Good, good, good. Oh, do you know what else I was thinking? We do Christmas poppers with the guests' names instead of place cards. I love that idea, that is so cute! This is going to be the best Christmas wedding ever. I should mention to you folks that there's a whole box of gold Christmas tree ornaments I'd be happy to sell you for half price. I assume there will be a Christmas tree at this wedding. We got so caught up in the excitement we forgot all about getting a tree. It should go directly behind you two during the ceremony. Yes. Rob, will that be good for the photos? Uh...uh, yeah, think it'd be great. Great, yes, so we have to go tomorrow afternoon just so we can keep up with the schedule. A Christmas wedding needs a Christmas tree. Um, tomorrow we're supposed to pick up our daughter, Tracy, at the airport and then go for lunch with her. But we could cancel lunch to make time for the tree. We've already made reservations and they were so hard to get. Well, you know what, don't worry about it. I will happily go down there and pick out the perfect tree for your wedding. Are you sure you don't mind? Oh, no, of course I don't mind. It's my job. Go enjoy time with your daughter. You are a lifesaver, thank you. Rob, you make sure to go with her to help out. A tree isn't easy to move from A to B, and you guys can take our truck. Oh, no, no, no, I am perfectly fine. I, I have it. I think she's very capable of picking out a tree for you two without my help. I'd only get in the way. Nonsense, no, this would be great for you guys to spend the day together, catch up, work as a team. Absolutely. Oh, um, I'm happy to help, happy to help. -Great. -Great. Great. A lot of trees here, we'll find one. How about this one? This is nice. No, there are too many gaps. We have to make sure our tree is big and full. Okay, no gaps, big and full. Yes. How about this one? This is good. No, too skinny. Right, we wouldn't want the other trees to be self-conscious if we choose it. All right. So, Newly Nuptials, huh? Seems a bit ironic to me. Why is that? Well if I do recall, you used to make fun of me for believing in true love and soul mates. I'm good at what I do. It doesn't matter the occasion or what my beliefs are, I capture moments. You should put that on your business cards. Already is. What about you? Seem to have done pretty well for yourself. Where you based? San Francisco. I've been working at an event agency there for the past six years. Oh, okay. You must be running the place by now. That is the plan. Okay. So, where are you based? New York, New York, I live in a one bedroom above a taco shop, so it perpetually smells bad. Oh, it can't be that bad. Tacos are delicious. They specialize in fish tacos. Okay, yes, that is, that is bad. Yeah. -Wait! -What? -This is it. -This one? -Yes. -Are you sure, you sure it's not too branchy or too green? No, it is perfect. Okay, we'll take this one. [♪] Okay, wait, -to the left. -Your left or my left? -Mine. -Your left, okay, so that's. -No, mine! -I'm, I'm going. Okay, wait, wait, wait, that's too far! I can't see because these branches are poking me in the eye. Just bring it towards me a little bit. Now I got tree sap in my mouth. [laughing] Are you seriously laughing at me right now? What are you doing? Oh, I'm capturing this moment forever. Oh, you're very funny. Okay, a little bit more. Oh, wait, wait, -that's good. -Good? -Yes. -Okay. -Yes. -All right. Yeah, nice job, it looks good. The officiant will be there, and then Sam and Nancy will be there and there. Yeah, I think the, the gold balls will look good once we put them on. You picked a good one. Well, thank you for your help today. I know it's not in your job description, so I really appreciate it. No, it wasn't that bad. Well, I guess it's time for me to open these boxes of ornaments and start decorating. So, I'll see you later? Yes, you will. Okay. Actually...you need some help decorating? Oh, you don't have to. I don't mind. Okay. [♪] -That's okay. -I like it. [♪] I love it. Okay, not bad. Yeah, you don't think it's a little too cluttered on the left side, that's kind of? What, really, you think? No, no, I was just double checking. You are such an... An oaf? That's... You remember that? A man never forgets something so obscene and hurtful, come on. It seems like it was so long ago. And yet it still hurt. [laughing] You know, I never asked you how things went in Italy. Was it incredible? Oh, yeah, it was, it was pretty cool. Pretty cool? I mean it was great. Come on, that's all I get? What else do you want? Nothing, I guess. We forgot the star. The tree doesn't have a star. You are right, a tree is not complete without a star. I'll look for it. Oh, I found one. Oh, great, crisis averted. Wow, it looks just like the star we used to put on my family's tree. You okay? Yeah, I'm fine. Um, can you put it up top? Yeah, I wonder if they have a ladder around here somewhere, -I mean I'm sure. -You know what we can do? You remember? Challenge accepted. -Let's do it. -Are you sure? -Yes. -Okay. All right, -you ready? -Yes. -Three, two, one. -Three, two, one. Oh, wait! -I got you. -I remember us being better at this. Just hurry and put -the star on already. -Well, I need you to put me closer to the tree. All right, -there you go. -Okay. -Good, you good? -All right, you can put me down. -All right, down. -All right. -You okay? -Mm-hmm. [♪] OMG, okay, this tree looks like amazing. Mom and dad are totally gonna flip. Oh, you must Tracy. Hi. I'm, I'm Corrine, the wedding planner. Oh, girl, I know, like, all about you, my parents would not stop singing your praises today. It's, like, so nice to meet you. Oh, nice to meet you, too. Well, if it isn't my favourite photographer. Hi Trac, how was your flight? Okay, cut the small talk and give me a hug. Of course. I'm sorry, you two know each other? Yeah, Tracy and I met at a wedding that I shot a few months ago. My cousin, Tad, once my parents and I saw the photos, we knew this was the guy for the job. What a talent. Come on, Trac, you're embarrassing me, you're making me blush. Good. We live close by in New York. You decorated for us, too? Oh, it's gorgeous. You have outdone yourselves. This, this looks marvelous. Isn't it just perf? As the official maid of honor, I approve. Oh, thank you, I'm so glad you all love it so much, but I can't take all the credit, I had some help. No, I just did what I was told, it was all her. You two make a great team. Come here, I have to, like, catch you up on everything that's going on. Come on! [♪] k the Halls ♪] Okay, ladies, so we have the venue obviously, we've already purchased a few of the decorations, but I'm a little worried about the invitations. I don't think we have enough time to get them through snail mail. Don't worry, Sam and I have called each guest individually to invite them. We're flying in exactly 25 of our closest family and friends. Okay, great, I'll make sure I order the chairs today. Um, and who's officiating the ceremony? My Great Uncle Bernie. He's, like, such a hoot. Oh, my gosh, I can't wait for you to meet him. Almost 80 and the life of the party. Oh, and I forgot to mention that I got you an appointment today at that bridal boutique. No way! Oh, I'm so relieved because you can't have the perfect wedding without the prefect dress. Mm-mm-mm. -I completely agree. -That we will find it, mom. Oh, and how do you two feel about having stockings on the back of the chairs with all the guests' wedding favors inside? That is absolutely adorable. So cute. You have the best ideas. Why thank you. Oh, also, I found a caterer who can do a traditional Christmas turkey dinner, and for dessert we will have a Christmas pudding, along with toffee nut lattes and gingerbread cappuccinos. Yum. Um, so, like, you're really good at this, can you plan my wedding some day? Oh, of course, I will be honored to. So, are you seeing anyone? Sort of, we're just getting to know each other, but I really like him, and I'm pretty sure we're gonna have, like, adorable babies one day. Okay, well will he be at the wedding? -Yes. -Yes, yes. Okay, that's, that's great. Well, like, what about you, any lucky guy waiting for you back in California? -Tracy! -What? If that's too personal, you do not have to answer. Oh, no, that's okay. I've actually been single for a little while now. My last relationship ended so long ago it almost feels like a dream. I find that so hard to believe. A successful beautiful woman like you? Well, yeah, dating has been tough. It feels like with my ex, every time we would look at each other there would be butterflies. I mean we connected instantly. I know that sounds silly, but, you know, it felt like true love. And that doesn't sound silly at all. What happened? I actually don't know what happened. I still don't have all the answers. That must have been extremely difficult. It was, but if we were meant to be together, we would have figured it out. I could never imagine Sam and I parting ways. Even after all these years, he still gives me the butterflies. Well, my dad used to always say, "If two people love and respect each other, the magic would never go away." He sounds like my kind of guy. Oh, he was the best. [click] Robbie! Hey! Good morning. Hey, ladies. What are you guys up to? We're just doing some planning and little girl talk. Oh, girl talk, I won't impose. No imposition whatsoever, your presence is always welcome. -You sure? -Mm-hmm. Okay. I was just gonna roll off a couple of photos, if that's okay. Go right ahead. Me, yeah? -Yeah, yeah. -Okay, do one? You're ready, you're -ready, got it. -Be, like, no? -I got it, I got it. -Okay. He doesn't want to make sure I look. -There you go, Nanc. -Thank you. You're like a model, mom. Oh yeah. What's on the schedule for today, ladies? Well, if you would have read the schedule that I've already given you, you would see that today we are going to the floral shop to pick out flowers, and we also have to design Nancy's bouquet, and now some dress shopping. And, um, I'm staying back to help my dad with some things, but I will be there to help with the dress search. By the way, you guys totally have to come by later on. We're thinking about playing Christmas charades. It's our favorite holiday tradition, and Uncle Bernie is arriving -today, and he loves to play. -Yes. Christmas charades not really my thing, but you guys go ahead. Yeah, charades has never really been my forte. Come on, you two are family this year, so you have to. And we totes, we're not taking no for an answer. Mm-hmm. Well, then I guess totes, I'm in. Really? I mean, yeah, I mean peer pressure, what are you, -what are you gonna do? -And he can't say no to me. -And that, too. -Yeah. Great, then I will see you guys later. -Mm-hmm, mwah. -Mwah. -Mwah, tootles. -Mwah. And you're not getting away without one either. Mwah, mwah. -Mwah, thank you. -Bye. Well, should we get started? [♪] What about red roses, would they look good with the gold decorations? Well, I think red roses would look great, but I feel like the amaryllis flower just screams Christmas to me. That's beautiful. Gosh, it is beautiful. We used to have them all over my house during Christmas. My dad loved them. Does he not love them anymore? Did I say loved? I meant to say loves. So, I think that we should order about 70 of them just to be safe? -Done and done. -Okay. Well, next, let's talk about your bouquet. I was thinking we should do champagne roses, beautiful, and some fresh berries, add a little greenery. And, oh, we can't forget the holly. And for our final touch, a pine cone right in the middle. Christmas in a bouquet. What do you think? I am speechless. You truly are the Christmas wedding queen. How did you just come up with that on the spot? That's, I can't... I can, she's brilliant. Oh, well, thank you, I wish my boss was here to hear you say that. Oh, don't worry, he'll be hearing from me after the wedding. [♪] We're gonna try these two. -Of course. -How are you doing in there, Nancy? Well, let's see. Oh, I look like a hot air balloon. No you don't, but don't worry, I picked out a bunch of dresses that I think would look great on you. We've already tried on seven different dresses. Yes, well maybe eight will be our lucky charm. Okay. Wait, wait, wait, how long is this gonna take? As long as it needs to. I once had a client try on dresses for eight hours straight. Eight hour, like, are you kidding me? -No. -I'm not gonna last that long. Well, it's always worth the wait when they find the right one. [♪] Okay, oh, no, I, I, I don't know. It's itchy and it just doesn't, it just doesn't feel good. Well, do you happen to have a slip that we could put underneath? Not for that kind of dress. Ah, it's hopeless. No, do not lose hope. I actually have a really good feeling about this one. This one, really? Yes, just try it. Sometimes the right one is the last one you'd expect. Okay. Ahhh! I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm here, sorry I'm late. Can you hold that? Yeah, I guess. How is it going so far? Ah, don't ask! That good, huh? We'll get there, it just takes some time. Mm-hmm, you having fun? Yeah, dress shopping is my Disney World. Okay. Oh, my goodness, mom, you look H to the O to the T. Are, are you sure I don't look like I'm trying to be 25? Oh no, absolutely not. It's so beautiful, so chic and classy. I think you look beautiful. But, the real question is do you feel beautiful in it? Mom, hey, what's wrong? I've always wanted a dress like this. See, I told you, I guess it was lucky number nine. What do you think, Rob? I think you look stunning, Nancy. It's a bit big though. Oh, do you think we'll have time to take in the sides a little bit, and maybe about an inch off the bottom? Sadly, I doubt it. I close for the holidays in two days to go on vacation with my family. We're travelling to Italy. It'll be a trip of a lifetime. Listen, I work for the Kirkland Agency in California, I will put you guys on our annual list of the best boutiques in the country if you can make this happen. Wow, you would do that? Yes, if this dress makes her feel beautiful and comfortable, that means she's truly herself when she's in it, and nothing feels more special when you're really seen, truly seen for who you are by the person you love. So, yes, if I can make sure that my client has that experience on her wedding day, yes, I would absolutely do that. Meet me here on Wednesday, four o'clock sharp, I'll have it ready. Don't be late, I am not missing my plane. I won't, thank you, thank you so much! Corrine, let me hug you. You are, like, -literally a lifesaver. -Okay. Okay, but now I'm doing sparkles. Well, that was amazing. -I know. -That was amazing. And I think you're amazing. [♪] [♪] There you go. What are you taking pictures of me for? You know I capture moments, come on. I wish I would have taken more pictures growing up. It would nice to hold some of those memories in my hands, you know. Yeah, well I mean that's the beauty of it when you take a picture of a moment, the memory becomes eternal. It's the only form of time travel we have. I like that. It sounds like something my dad would say. Speaking of, I never asked you how your family is doing. They're good. Elizabeth has a little boy now, Max, he's seven. Wow, with, um, Matthew, correct? Yes. And what about your parents, how are they? -They're good, too. -Good. How about your parents, how are they? Good, they're good, they're good, they're both enjoying retirement. Yeah, and my mom's with my stepdad on a cruise for three weeks, and my dad is with Doreen in Florida. Wait, so you're not gonna spend Christmas with them? No, no, I'll probably be tired after the wedding, so I'm probably just gonna go back home and sleep with the smell of fish tacos wafting around me. Oh, that's so sad. Yeah, and what about you, you going back to Boston? Yes, I'm taking the train home right after the wedding. Okay. Well you have to tell everyone I say hi, please. -I will. -Good. The holidays were always so special at your place, you know. [cell phone ringing] Oh, it's Victor. I'll call him back. You sure? Yeah. Hi Corrine, yes, it's, it's Victor calling a third time, yeah. Just waiting for you to return my call, give me an update, as your boss. So then, it was, like, the final rose of the night, and he gave it to Chelsea, it was crazy. Which one's Chelsea? Dad, have you even been listening? Can somebody pass me one of those Christmas cookies? How did I know that was coming? Come on, guys, you're gonna miss Christmas charades. Finally, I totally thought you two were gonna bail on us. Okay, Corrine, you're gonna be with my Uncle Bernie. Lovely to meet you. Now, I hear you were the hero of the day. Oh, hardly. It's lovely to meet you as well. I've heard nothing but good things. Oh, my goodness, I love your shoes! Please don't get him started on his footwear, you'd think he was Beyoncé based on his shoe collection. You'll have to bear with me tonight, my charades game is not what it used to be. I'm lucky if I can even read the clues. Oh, no, if we get one hand, I will consider that an epic win. My kind of partner. Rob, you're gonna be with me. Tracy and Sam, you'll be the third team, okay. -Mm-hmm. -Mm-hmm. Let's get started. -All right. -Rob, you're up first. Yup, here we go. It's all good. All right, you ready? -I'm ready. -Let's do this! And go! Okay, roaring. -Abominable snowman! -Yeah, yes! [laughing] Pole dancers, snow, is it snow? Snowflakes! Yeah, good job! Soldiers. The Greeks! Yeah, the Greeks, the Greeks! Yes! Eating, cracker, cracker, the nutcracker? Yes! Yes, yes! I got it. -Mr. Claus. -Yes! Okay, everybody, if Sam and Tracy win this one, they've won the entire game. Oh, gees. Yeah, no pressure or anything. Go! Okay. Shush, quiet, shush, shush. Shush, quiet, be quiet. Fifteen seconds! Stay, stay quiet, silence, silence, night, nighttime, sleeping, the, the Night Before Christmas? -No, Silent Night! -Yeah! Yeah! Sam and Tracy are the winners for the third year in a row! You, my girl, are a rock star. I am so glad you made it home for Christmas. And I love you, my dad. [laughs] [♪] Well, this was a lot of fun, you guys, but I just realized that I have some work to get finished. Thank you so much and have a good night. Good night, Corrine. Good night, Corrine. Sweet dreams kid. Thanks. [♪] What are you still doing up? Peppermint tea still your favorite? Yes, thank you. You're welcome. So, what do I owe this pleasure, -more logistics to go over. -No. You left so abruptly during charades, I wanted to make sure everything was okay. Oh, yes, I'm, I'm fine. Corrine, it's me, come on. Tonight was just a lot of fun, you know. It was the first time in a long time that I've actually felt the joy of Christmas. Being with the Bennet's reminded me of what my family used to be like. Used to be? Yeah, it's been a hard few years. Why is that? It's complicated. Okay, if you don't want to talk about it, it's okay, I understand. It's my dad, he's sick. Sick? Four years ago he was diagnosed with early onset Alzheimer's. So, he started getting confused, forgetting basic things. Corrine, I'm so sorry. And it got so bad that he even started forgetting us...me, and all of our memories together. I can't imagine how painful that must be. Yeah, so seeing Sam and Tracy tonight just reminded me of my dad and I once upon a time. We used to love being partners during game nights. Yeah, you guys had an amazing relationship. It was intimidating. Intimidating? Of course, his youngest daughter's first boyfriend, come on. I just wanted him to know that you were always safe when you were with me. He knew. Anyway, that's why Christmas has been so hard for me these past few years. My dad loved -the holidays. -Yeah. He used to rent out an ice skating rink for -Elizabeth and I. -Yeah, I remember. He used to always make sure Christmas was so magical for us. Now I'm just lucky if he can even remember my name. So, honestly, Christmas has lost all its magic. Come on, don't say that. I'm sure there's still some magic left in Christmas. Says you, there's a twist. Memories with our loved ones, they're, they're, they're precious, you know. And sometimes we forget how precious they are until it's gone. I mean trust me, I know what it's like to feel forgotten. Yeah, I was just so focused on work and getting ahead these past few years, so I just, I felt like I missed out on so much time with him, you know. No, no, don't do that to yourself. Okay, he knew how much you loved him. He still does. I bet he was so proud of you when you moved cross country to follow your dreams, yeah? I know. It's just hard. It's the most painful heartbreak since... [♪] Do you want to go for a walk? Right now? Yeah, right now, you and me. Okay. [♪] I remember Professor Brown. I remember he caught us passing notes in class, and he told me, he said, "Unless you're majoring in flirtation, Robert, you better smarten up." Yeah, you were so embarrassed. That's the day I asked you to the movies, right? Yes, to see Deer Hunter at Revival. What kind of insane first date was that? You said you liked classic cinema. Yes, like, An Affair to Remember, or Casablanca. That movie gave me nightmares. Fair enough, fair enough. Actually, I went to Casablanca a few years ago for a photo exhibition, it was amazing. Oh yeah, I saw that photo you did of the woman from the village in a National Geographic, it was incredible. You subscribe to their magazine? No. Do you want to sit? Yeah, sure. I may have peeked at your website once or twice. Okay. Yeah, you're really talented. The way you capture people and places, it's incredible. Well, I have you to thank for that. Remember all those hours you let me take photos of you and practice my lighting and my lenses, it's you must have been so bored. No way, I was never -bored with you. -Really? Well, except for that one time where you tried to make me watch the Godfather. I think the four hundredth time it was, yeah, that, that was boring. Okay, I guess I need to brush up on my movie choosing skills when I'm trying to impress a girl. Yeah, I'd say so. Speaking of, what's the deal with Tracy? Tracy Bennet? Don't play dumb. No, I mean I guess she does bat her eyes at me quite a bit when she's talking about who she thinks her future husband is. Really? I mean she calls you Robbie. That's just Tracy. She has a nickname for everyone. I'm surprised she hasn't called you Coco yet. Mm-hmm, I was pretty sure you're the man that she was talking about. Nope, not me, we're just friends. Plus, she's not my type. Gorgeous isn't your type? No, beautiful inside and out, it's always been my weakness. [♪] What's up with you and Uncle Bernie? I saw you guys looking at each other during charades. The chemistry is undeniable. There's something there. You are silly. Oh, my gosh, he is a very nice man. Okay, okay. Well you're smiling, I like that. Thank you. [♪] Okay, so the next one we are going to try is hot chocolate cake with whipped cream. Mmmm. Thank you, papa. Oh, what end to start on? Mmm. Hmm, mmm. Wow, this is amazing. Delectable. I think I still like the chocolate ganache North Pole cake better. Really? Yeah, I agree with dad, but this is, like, incredible though. Noted. Now the next cake we're going to try may sound a little strange, but it has been a big hit at all of the Christmas parties I've planned, eggnog cake. -Oh. -It's this one? All right. Yes. Thank you. [♪] Oh, mmm, this is it, this is the one. Yes, dad. The texture is to die for. I might. [laughing] Like redonculous. So, is this it, -eggnog cake? -Mm-hmm. -All right. -Definitely. -I'll get it ordered. -Everything is coming together. In a few short days, we'll have a real wedding, just like you always dreamed. I'm, like, so excited for you guys. I just wish my sweet Susanna were here to see it. She would have loved all this. Was that your wife? Yes. She was my bright light. They were married for over 50 years. Wow, she's beautiful. My Honeybee. So, what's your secret? Thoughtfulness. Always remember to do kind gestures for one another, even if it's as simple as making their favorite cup of tea. Where is Rob today? Shouldn't he be taking pictures? He went in to town to do something. He said it was important. So, speaking of going into town, do you think you could pick up my dress today? I have a conference call that might take far longer than I'd like. Oh, of course, I'd be happy to. Thank you. I can't wait to see it again. Oh, Sam, you're just gonna love it. I'm sure I will, hon. She looks hot, dad, hot. [laughs] Okay, well, who would like to try some red velvet cake with cream cheese -frosting just for fun? -Oh, me. -Me. -Me. No saying no to that. [♪] [♪][tapping] [♪] Am I interrupting? Nothing, no, not at all, hey. Okay. So, what's up? I see that you have some time in your schedule today. Oh, not much, I have to go pick up Nancy's dress and start prepping decorations. Come on, not even an hour or so? I might be able to squeeze something in for an hour. What are you thinking? Grab your coat. [♪] Where are you taking me? Why is it so cold? You'll see. Okay, Niko, now! [♪] Can I take it off? Now you can. [jingling] I rented out an ice rink for us. Now, I know it's not the same without your dad, but, look, I just couldn't bear the thought of Corrine Millbrook not believing in Christmas magic. You did all this for me? Of course I did. But you don't even believe in Christmas magic. Well, let's just say I'm starting to. How did you? You're not the only one with the power of persuasion. I don't know what to say. Thank you. You're welcome. Now, are you ready to get your Gretzky on? I was born ready. -Wee! -Look at you. Actually like Michelle Kwan with this spotlight. It looks good on you. Oh, we should have been figure skaters. I bet you we both would have made it to the Olympics. You think so? -Mm-hmm. -Let's test that theory out then. Okay. -Come on. -Oh, goodness. Are you ready? Look, look at us. [laughing] I think so, Olympics a little bit, a little bit, a little bit. All right, now let me see a triple axel. Triple axel, so we shall go here, then we shall spin and we shall stop like that. Boom, gold medal finalist for sure. Why thank you. Don't you just -love skating? -Yeah. I just feel so free. I feel like I'm floating on air. Oh, I think you might have missed your calling, -you're a natural. -Thank you. Oh, wait. I got you. Yeah, natural. Maybe we should slow down because I don't want to be the reason that the most talented wedding planner in the country goes to the hospital. Okay, maybe you make an excellent point. -I will just glide. -All right. [♪] So, I want to talk to you about something. What is it? Last night when you told me that you looked me up online, I looked you up, too, a few times. Oh, so the truth comes out. I was a little embarrassed to admit it. But I thought about you a lot when I was in Italy. Now, there's no reason to be embarrassed, I think I looked you up almost every day. Really? Yeah, I cried my eyes out when you left. Some days I was so upset I couldn't even function. So, why didn't you call or email? Well, I didn't think it would be fair to break up with you and then pester you every day. [♪] So, it was a break up under the tree? What? See, I knew it. You knew what? We both agreed to it. That was ridiculous. Well, if you weren't gonna take it seriously, I wish you would have informed me. Take it serious, what? Nothing, I, I don't want to talk about it. No, maybe we should talk about it. But why, what does it matter now? We were just kids. Just because we were younger doesn't mean it was any less real. Look, being around you now, it made me realize how real it was. How can you be so sure? I know a way. [♪] -Oh, my gosh! -What? -The dress. -That's what you were thinking about in this moment? What time is it? Three forty-five. Oh, no, no, no, I'm late, I have to go. Corrine, wait, wait! No, I can't do this right now, I'm sorry. [♪] Oh, no, no, no, this can't be happening! Closed for the holidays! I'm only 10 minutes late! Okay, get it together, get it together. What do I do now? [♪] You lost track of time, how? Well, I was taking care of other errands and I didn't realize it had gotten so late. Have you tried calling? I did, and her voicemail says she's already on vacation and they're not open again until January 4th. I am so sorry, Nancy. My wedding is in four days and I don't have a dress. This is really bad, Corrine. I will find you another dress. Yes, please. Corrine, you have been amazing ever since you've been here, but the dress is essential. I know, I know, and I am really, really sorry. I will find you another dress, the perfect dress. Hey, Corrine is amazing at what she does, mom. -Yeah. -And she will figure it out. -Mm-hmm. -Right? Right. Okay. Yes, hi, I was wondering do you have any time today for a dress appointment? Completely booked, so no time to squeeze us in at all? No, I literally need five, 10 minutes tops and I prom- Hello? What am I gonna do? [cell phone ringing] Victor, hi. How goes it? I miss seeing my favorite planner around the office. I miss you, too, Victor. I can't wait to come home and see your face again every day. So, are you the little Christmas genie making all of their wedding wishes come true or what? I'm trying. Trying? Well that doesn't sound like someone who's about to be partner. I'm sorry, I've just been distracted. Well snap out of it. Look, I'm not about to go into business with someone who is distracted, so whatever it is, or whoever it is, get rid of them. Corrine, do you hear me? Yes, I understand. Get rid of them. [♪] Nancy, are you okay? She's just worried about the dress. Maybe we were just too ambitious to try and pull all this off in just two weeks. We should delay until next Christmas. No way! I told you, I can figure this out. How? It's too late. We can fix this. Nancy, I want this wedding to be everything you've ever dreamed of. If we can't find another dress that you love, we'll postpone. Absolutely not. I can find you another dress, this is what I do. Okay. And don't you even think about cancelling anything until I get back. Where are you going in such a hurry? I'm going to fix this mess. What mess? Because of you I wasn't able to pick up the dress and now the bride has no dress. Because of me? Look, we both lost track of time. Look, I was just trying to cheer you up. Don't, okay, I can't afford any distractions right now. So that's what I am to you? I'm a distraction to you? Just over the next few days, can you please just let me do my job? I cannot miss the chance of getting partner over someone who wasn't even considerate enough to let me know that he didn't even plan on showing up to the tree. We had a deal, and that little kiss that we had doesn't change our past. That little kiss? Look, don't pretend like all that wasn't just an elaborate way out, okay. I remember what you said at the rink, we broke up. Now, see, you should have just said that like a normal person, instead of coming up with a ridiculous contract. Really? Yeah, really. Then why did I drive from Boston that night on Christmas Eve? I could have been spending that time with my dad. I felt so stupid waiting there. You went? I, I didn't know. Forget it, I don't have to explain myself to you. [♪] Please, please, yes, yes, hello, hi. Oh, you're closed for the holiday, too. Well, would you happen to know any wedding boutiques that might still be open? [jingling] No? Okay, thanks. I need a Christmas miracle. Not having a great day? Bernie, what are you doing here? Just exploring the town, thinking about my Honeybee. You all right? Yeah, no, I mean I don't know. I've really messed things up, and I don't know what to do, I've ruined everything. Don't be so hard on yourself. Now when in doubt, you just let the magic of Christmas guide ya. I don't know if I believe in the magic of Christmas anymore. I feel like this holiday has brought me more heartache than joy lately. Maybe you're just not taking the time to notice the magic anymore. But I have a feeling it's still there. You look ravishing. [jingling] Hold on, what size is that dress? [♪] [♪] Oh, you look amazing! I can't believe you found this. It fits perfectly. Well, the store owner was inspired by you two recommitting to love each other no matter what. Well you really know how to think on your feet. I am very, very impressed. Thank you. I love you, okay, bye. Wow! Right. Oh, my gosh, mom, you look, like, amazing. Good job. And you look happy. I just talked to Brian. Oh, that's wonderful. Isn't falling in love so much fun? Like, the best. And when you find someone who, I don't know, really, really gets you, it's important to cherish that. Aren't I right, Corrine? Definitely. So, he thought you broke up with him when you guys made that deal? That's why he didn't show up? Apparently. There has to be more to it than that, that doesn't make any sense. I'm just so confused. Well, at least this wedding is almost done, and you won't ever have to see him again. Yeah, I guess. You guess? Being around him has made me realize how much I really miss him. Do you still love him? I don't know. I mean the kiss was so magical. It's just it still hurts that he didn't take our deal seriously, so. You never told me about a kiss. Okay, I will fill you in on all the details when I come home, but right now I just need to focus on decorating for this wedding. Corrine, I love you. I am here for you no matter what. I know. I love you, too. Thanks Liz. [♪] Hey. This, this looks incredible. I mean you did it. Thanks. Yeah, you should be really proud. As long as Sam and Nancy like it, I love it. I'm sure they will. Do you need something? Yeah, I, I want to talk to you about the other night. What about it? I showed up to the tree and you didn't, what more is there to talk about? Look, I was going to go, okay, trust me. I, I mean I had my clothes picked out, everything. Oh really? So, what happened, did you get stuck in traffic? The night before I was supposed to meet you, I looked you up online, okay, and I saw a bunch of pictures with a guy named Victor. It was the same guy that called the other night. Now, why would I go all the way to Connecticut to meet a girl that had a boyfriend, right? Wow, really? Yeah, really. Look, if you guys are still together just tell me. No, no, don't shake your head at me. Look, I, I, I deserve to know. Victor is my boss. And not that it matters, but he's been happily married to his husband, David, for the past 10 years. That seriously your boss? Why would I need to lie about that? Look, I'm sorry, okay, I'm sorry. I thought that the contract was elaborate weird way to, to end things with me. If I wanted to end things with you, then why have I been keeping my half of the postcard all these years? You still have it? In my bedside drawer, underneath a copy of Alice in Wonderland that my dad gave me when I was eight years old. Wow, I mean you kept it. Why? Why do you think? You're right, you're right, I should have showed up. But you didn't. Please forgive me, please. You really don't get it, do you? Even if you thought I was with someone else, if you truly loved me, you would have shown up, you would have kept your half of the postcard, but no, instead you decided to give up. The shoemaker wouldn't have given up so easily. He's not even real, okay. But what we had was. And you threw it away over an insane two year deal for us to be apart. I wanted you to pursue your dreams, that's how much I loved you, and all I asked was for you to show up to a tree, and you couldn't even do that. What if I did? What if we had a redo? What do you mean? Meet me at the Christmas tree, please. Do you still have your half of the postcard? No, I threw it out. Look, Rob, what's done is done. It's obvious we weren't meant to be together. You don't mean that. I deserve someone who's gonna show up. Now if you'll excuse me, I have work to finish. [♪] [♪] Penny for your thoughts. Ha, hey, Bernie. I was just thinking about the shots I'm gonna shoot for the, the wedding. Yeah, I may be old, but I'm not stupid. Can I join ya? Please, I'd, I'd love the company. I know that face, problems of the heart? That obvious? Who's the lucky lady? An old girlfriend from college. We recently connected and then we had a big fight, and I just, I don't know what to do. Do you love her? I think I do. I, I think I always have actually. Then you know what you need to do. What? Show her. That's what I did with my Susanna. It took me years to show her how much I loved her, but it was so worth it in the end. Yeah, it's, it's complicated. Seven years ago she took a postcard from a Christmas tree, and apparently a shoemaker had made it, and she ripped it in half, and we each took a piece, and she said in two years we would both come back to the same tree with our pieces, and if we did, then what we had was true love, and we never gave up on each other. Well call me an old softie, but that sounds pretty romantic to me. Yeah, the problem is, is I didn't show up. Why not? I, I thought she had moved on, forgotten about me, and found someone else, and she showed up, and I stood her up and I, I just, I feel awful. Well don't worry, at Christmastime anything is possible. Oh, don't tell me you believe in Christmas magic, too. It's all around ya, kid, you just have to believe. True love will always find a way. Yeah, I keep hearing that. Mm-hmm, you should listen. [♪] Have a good night. You too. [♪] I can't believe everyone's here. How's your mom? Really nervous, but really excited. Thank you for everything you've done for my family. It's, it's been a pleasure to watch you work. Thank you, Tracy. It has been a pleasure to bring your parent's dream to life. You know, when my parents first got married, my dad thought the idea of the whole wedding thing was a waste of money and silly, but once he realized how much it meant to my mom, he's just gone above and beyond to make it perfect. And I think it sometimes takes people a little extra time to realize what these type of moments really mean. Well that's the beauty of second chances. I think so. Um, I think everyone deserves a second chance. And there's Brian, looks, like, so handsome, I feel like I'm sweating. And Rob looks pretty cute, too, huh? What, hmm? Oh, I'm just saying I think he might be some kind of monk. He told me he hasn't dated anyone seriously since college, so. She must really have been something. Well, you should get upstairs. We'll be starting soon. I'll see you out there. [♪] [♪] Okay, let's make sure the bride is ready. She will need to walk in the next 30 seconds. [♪] Welcome everyone. We are gathered here tonight to celebrate and share in the love between Sam and Nancy Bennet. Two people who have honored and cherished one another since the time they shared in college, and have never faltered in their love for each other since. They have made sacrifices for each other, and encouraged one another, but most importantly, they have never stopped fighting for each other. This is the greatest love. This is true love. Love is patient. Love is kind. It does not envy, it does not boast, it is not proud. It does not dishonor others. It is not self-seeking. It does not easily anger. It keeps no record of wrongs. [♪] [♪] You just knocked it out of the park, Corrine. I just, I can't wait to talk to Victor about it. Thank you so much. Enjoy. [♪] Bernie, hi. Beautiful ceremony. You were wonderful up there. Well that's very kind of ya. I just spoke from the heart. Actually, I was gonna sneak out. Basically, my job is done here. Not so fast, no, I expect a dance first. I would, I'm just really not in the mood. Come on, don't leave an old man hanging. [♪] You all right? I don't know, I'm a little out of sorts truthfully. How come? It's a long story. They always are. Did, did Susanna ever do anything throughout the years that made you question whether or not you were meant to be. Oh, she dismissed me for a long time. I almost gave up, believing that the, it must not be meant to be, until one day, she finally agreed to go on one date with me, and the rest is history. -Really? -Mm-hmm. That must have been some first date. It was. And neither of us could deny the magic we had together. Well was it easy after that? Oh, no relationship is easy. No, everybody brings different fears and insecurities to the table that create complications and misunderstandings, but that's just part of the adventure. Well, how do you know if someone's worth holding onto, or if you should finally let them go? That's a great question. I believe that love has a sneaky way of showing us the answer, true love. Well, thank you for the dance, Bernie, but I really must catch this train. Can you please tell Sam and Nancy and Tracy goodbye for me? I can do that. And Rob too. Sure can. It's been a pleasure meeting you. Oh, the pleasure was all mine. Oh, don't forget your stocking. I left a little present in there for ya. Merry Christmas. Merry Christmas, Bernie. [♪] To the train station, please. [♪] [♪ Jingle Bells ] Bernie. [♪ Jingle Bells ] Excuse me, Trac. -This is the Cha Cha. -I'm sorry, Bernie, have you seen Corrine? I have actually. She just left. She said to tell you goodbye. Left, where, where is she going? She mentioned something about a train station. She's gone? Oh, yeah, she didn't seem herself, she definitely had something on her mind. I'm too late. Don't give up hope, Christmas magic is all around us tonight from the top of the tree to the bottom of our stockings. Yeah. It's Corrine, Bernie. It's Corrine, she's the one that I love, and I, I let her get away again. Have you actually told her that you still love her? No, but I, I know I should have, I... What are you waiting for? You think I should go after her? What do I know, I'm just an old shoemaker. You're right, you're right, I, I have to fight for her, right. Thank you, thank you, Bernie. Oh, wait, don't forget your stocking. Thanks. Wait, shoemaker, Bernie, Bernard, no way. [jingling] [♪ Jingle Bells ] From the top of our tree to the bottom of our stockings. [♪] [jingling] Huh? [♪] What the...how? Bernie. [♪] It's 11:53. [♪] Please. [♪] Merry Christmas, Susanna. [♪] You know, I heard about an old wives' tale once. A man who loved the woman so much that he devoted years of his life to prove that what they had was true love. Really? Yeah. I've never heard that one. The crazy thing is, it's not an old wives' tale, it's real. It's more real than, than I ever thought possible. You found your half. Let's just say Christmas magic was on my side tonight. Tell me about it. I just can't believe you're here. Well true love always finds a way, remember? Is that what we have, true love? There's no doubt in my mind that's what we have. I love you, Corrine, I always have. I'm sorry that I didn't believe in us. I let my pride get in the way. You were right, you deserve someone who's going to show up, and I'm here and I always will be, if you'll have me. Of course I'll have you. I love you, Rob. You're the one, you always have been. I love you, too, Corrine, and I will devote every moment I have to you, even if that mean I have to move to San Francisco. Merry Christmas, my handsome oaf. Merry Christmas, my love. Wait, so does this mean that I actually get to spend Christmas Day with you? Does this mean that I finally get to spend Christmas with your family? Well, I am making these amazing snowman pancakes. Well you know I'm a waffle guy. That's okay, we can negotiate. Deal? Deal. [♪] [♪]
