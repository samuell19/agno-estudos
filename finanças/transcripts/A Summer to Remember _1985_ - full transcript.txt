Try to avoid any sudden stops, okay? No kiddin'. Trish? She's bent the chair in half, but otherwise, no problem. We should be home in about an hour. Heat up some coffee for me. That guy's drunk. Yeah, I'll try and get in front of him here. Well, be careful. I'd rather be in front of him, though, than behind him. Still dizzy? You want a ride in the ambulance? I just talked to the people at the Radford Institute, Howard. It's an ape, alright. Some kind of research animal. What about the drunk? Did he pull the woman from the wreck? He says, "no". Why? Take a look at that door on her side. It's been peeled back like a banana. and grunting> Have a good night, Trev. On my regular drive, I'll make it the next run Good seein' ya. Jill, honey. Where's Toby now? There he is! I'll go get him. He says that he saw Bigfoot. [Man] Is that right? Was that a *big* Bigfoot or a *little* Bigfoot? He says, "was it a *big* Bigfoot or a *little* Bigfoot?" squeaking close> He says that you don't believe him. Of course I do. You hear those dogs? Those are Bigfoot hunters. One's a crawlin'. Come on. [Sheriff] Okay, no more dogs. They weren't any good, anyway. Look, Dr. McKeever. I don't want anything to happen to this animal. I love animals. But no one can say exactly what she'll do out there, right? Now, there's got to be something you can think of that might draw her out. Some sound, maybe. Or a bell, or something. She should have responded to Trish's voice. Well, she didn't. Is there anything else that you can think of? Wait a minute! Sesame Street. How's that? The music to Sesame Street. She loves the record. Especially that Bert and Ernie song, "I love my rubber ducky". "I love my rubber ducky". We're home. Welcome home. Hey, momma. Toby's just gettin' his things together. You got a sleepy one here. Yeah. Everything alright? So, how did it go with Toby? He didn't exactly call me "daddy", if that's what you mean. This was more or less a... a business trip. What I gotta do is I got to take him fishin' or something like that. Yeah, well, you got all summer. Oof! Hey, Toby! Toby! What's wrong?! What?! What's he saying? He says he saw a gorilla. It's Bigfoot again Toby, stop! Stop. Jill's asleep, look. Toby! Jill, it's alright, honey. It's alright, it's alright. Okay, okay! Where? Where's the gorilla? A gorilla? Toby, there is nothing out there. Stop it. No. Escaped from the circus? What circus? As I just pulled into town, we passed it on the way in. No, Toby. No, Toby. Just stop it. Toby! Toby, stop it! Stop it! I love you. Well, at least that makes two of you. Toby loves you, too. It's just difficult for him to show it. I love Toby. Come on, Jeannie. I didn't walk into this with my eyes closed. I knew it was going to be hard, but I didn't realize how hard It's only been six months. What do you want from him? I want him to accept me. If not as his step-father, at least... as a friend. It'll be alright. Maybe I expect too much from him, but you do, too. You keep pushing him, expecting him to talk again. The doctors say.. I know the doctors said that the meningitis affected his hearing. It has nothing to do with why he cannot talk. There are no guarantees, Jeannie. No guarantees. Toby will talk again. We just have to give it time. I'll try. And I'm learnin', Jeannie. I am learnin'. And I got all the time in the world. Let's do it. I am o-v [Jill] I bet it could. It could climb right up the side of the house. And I wouldn't even hear it. Toby? Did this thing look more scared? Or more angry? Toby. Was it more scared or more angry? It probably wouldn't want to get us. Or anything, would it? Toby. Did you really see the gorilla? Not like "Gremlins" or Bigfoot. But did you really see the gorilla? Okay! Okay! It probably did escape from the circus. And it came here because of all the fruit and everything. It's probably hungry.

What is this? What's this? Oh! It's a pretty picture. A picture of a... a big...black animal, eating... What? A banan... Banana? Okay. What's going on? Where are those bananas? Toby? Jill? The treehouse?! Why? Tom, did you know anything about this? Well, we have to, if there *was* a gorilla, he'd be hungry. Well, that's just fine, except there isn't a gorilla. Jeannie. Toby. Let's stop this right now. Okay? There is... no...gorilla... in Salem. That's not funny, Tom. The gorilla is in the circus; not our back yard. [Jill] He must have escaped, he says. It didn't escape. If the gorilla escaped, we'd see it on... TV. And in the newspapers. And probably, we'd see policemen knocking on our front door. Unless the guys at the circus didn't want panic in the streets. [Jeannie] Tom. Really, Jeannie, I mean. Think of it. I mean, people fleeing, in terror, while this huge monster... raging throught the streets and attacking little girls. Jill, Hmmmm No, Toby. No, you thought you saw a gorilla. You... wanted to see, bu... Toby, let's not start this again, please? No, there's no gorilla. No Peter Pan. There are no gremlins. Jeannie. What? He says he knows what he saw. Period. Toby. I'm sorry. I know that you believed what you saw. But, Sometimes, your imagination is so strong, Remember... when you were sick with meningitis? You thought you were on a boat. Remember? I had to show you... that we were still in the army hospital. You though your father had come back. Toby. Listen. I need to talk, too. You thought your father had come back. You heard his voice, and even smelled his cigarettes. But, he didn't come back. I know you saw it, Toby. But let it go. Please? Let it go. Now, what about the circus, huh? Okay. Tomorrow. And Toby? Give Tom a chance. Please? He deserves that. He's a good man and... I love him. And I think that you'll love him, too. Toby! Toby! You were right! Today, the bananas are gone! See, look right down there. See, it's the bottom of the tree. See it? A banana peel. What do you think they're doin'? Furnishin' the treehouse, it looks like, honey It's called "playing", Jeannie. Dr. Spock says it's very healthy. Am I that bad? Well.... When you said, "There was no Peter Pan..." It kind of speared me through the heart, too. Hitting wood. No, no. This goes over here. So we can put this right here. Then, we'll put the sleeping bag... Right here. And the pillow, right here. So you can look out the window. Of course, if we make friends with the gorilla, and he's tame and everything, he could sleep here and look up at the stars. Or you think he'd rather look at the house? Well. I think he'd like to look up at the stars. Of course, if I put it the other way, he could see our bedroom window. Hand me the food, will ya? Toby, you just put it down. Up there. Oh, no. Whoa! Toby! Toby! Wow! Aw, yuck. Want drink? It signed "more drink". Toby, this thing can talk! Where do you come from? From trees? It came from trees? Yeah. What's your name? K C K.C....? Casey! Is that boy's name or a girl's name? A girl. What she want? A doll? She wants a doll? Alright. I got plenty of them. She sure is picky. Jill? Jill? You kids still up there? Yeah. We found the gorilla, mommy! And he can tal... Well, that's fine, dear, but, uh... it's time to come in now, so tell the gorilla goodbye. We should tell her, Toby. Yeah, it's alright. Don't be afraid. And if you're real good, and do everything that we say, tomorrow I'll find you another doll. Yeah, we have to go now. Boy, I gotta get a camera. Jill, will you come on? And bring Toby. Coming! Nice meeting you. Now, you don't have to keep the place like this. You know. I mean, If you want the sleeping bag over there... [Announcer] Orphaned at six months, Casey would have remained in a zoo all her life if not for Dr. Dolly McKeever. Dr. McKeever, a Ph.D in linguistics, persuaded zoo officials to let her try to teach Casey American sign language, the language commonly used by the deaf which translates words into hand signals. Incredibly, within two months, Casey was using sign language in two word combinations. Signing "more drink", for example, or "apple good". Seen here in her workshop, Dr. McKeever asked Casey what she wants to do now. Casey signs "dolly". "house" "eat". She wants to go home for dinner. As Casey's vocabulary grew, her sentences became more complex. When irritated, for example, she's apt to call someone "a rotten bird" or "dirty toilet face". Now the doctor has asked Casey to find the kitty among three drawing on the blackboard. The ape has shown the ability to rhyme, both in sign and in English and has become an excellent liar. Usually blaming a broken lamp or plate on one of Dr. McKeever's assistants. Dolly! I saw the light on! I thought maybe you found her. No, I'm just showing them an old video on Casey. So... Now I know why this place looks more like a nursery than a cage. She's my little girl. I promise you I'll find her. Uh, We couldn't sleep, mommy. Because of the circus. But you can go back to sleep if you want to. We'll be downstairs. Okay? Okay, mom? Okay.

Hey, look! They do have a gorilla! He has to go to the bathroom. You want me to go with him? No, he'll be fine. Toby. We're all going to be in there, okay? Whoops. Oh, come on, now. Will you stop worrying? Come on, honey. Let's go inside. Excuse me. Smitty. How many times I tell you about stacking up them camels outside my camper? They're on next, Mr. Fargo. I don't care. Get them out of here. What'll I do with them? Don't tempt me. Put 'em...put 'em in the back with Mighty Max. Mighty Max don't feel so good, Mr. Fargo. He's feelin' a little ill, that's all. They're like us. They get a toothache or a headache, they don't work. They just... slump down in the cage. Smitty, who owns this great circus? [Smitty] You do. Who's my animal feeder here? Need I say more? Alright, come on, girls. Come on. Hey, kid! Whaddya doin'?! Get back here! Grab him! Hey, Smitty! Get that kid! Dammit, Toby! You're in trouble, understand? Smitty! Smitty! Come on! Get everybody movin'! Alright, eh... Back to work, y'all! Quiet those horses, too. Yes, sir, Mr. Fargo. Yeah, yeah, I know. Was it there? Was it there? Was the gorilla there, huh?! Okay. No. More. Gorillas. It's finished. Huh?! Come on. [Tom] What the...? Oh, my. [Tom] Dammit. It's gotta be that Axleman kid. I caught him and his pals sneakin' around the barn yesterday. What a mess. Kids. You might as well start cleanin' this stuff up. We have to clean up. Here, sweetheart. Honey. Come on, let's take a look around. She's probably just scared. She'll come back.

Mr. Wyler? That's right. What can I do for you? I'm Phil Meadows from KPRW in Salem. I'm sorry to bother you, sir, but we were hoping to do a piece on your kids and the orangutan? Not tonight. The kids are asleep. It'll only take a minute. Can we just talk to you, then? How's he doin'? This is, uh, a reporter wants to do a piece on the kids. Look, it doesn't have to be tonight. Uh, we're going to tape the orang at the circus tomorrow, so maybe if your kids want to say goodbye to it, we could all get together. Goodbye? [Phil] Yeah. The circus is pulling out the day after tomorrow. We'll call you tomorrow, then. Thanks, goodnight. That'll be fine. Thanks. Unbelieveable. This whole thing is unbelieveable. How is Toby? I don't know. He... He just sits there, with his head down. It scares me, Tom. I've seen it before. You only can try. Okay. You look at me. Now you listen! We're sorry. We were wrong. You were right. We're sorry. Now what? Pals? Toby. Alright. I was wrong. It was my fault. I didn't believe you. But from now on, anything you say, I'll believe it. Okay? Okay, Toby? What do you mean, 'no'? Yes! If you say it, I'll believe it. True. C-C'mon. Try me. C'mon. K C can talk. The ape talks. Where is she?! Where is she at?! Is she told me she's in jail. Yeah, we're real sorry. We didn't want anything to happen to you. Okay, Al. Start rolling. No, you have to stay here. They're looking for dolly. Me go home. Hurry. Hurry. Want Doll want Toby My God, it really can talk. [Fargo] What do you mean it can talk? It's speaking Ameslan Sign language. Someone's taught it sign language. Sign language, huh? What's it sayin'? She wants to go home. She's saying, "Go home". Hurry. Hurry. I don't believe it. [Jeannie] Neither do I, but it's true. [Fargo] What's it saying now? Sick His gorilla's sick. Sick. That's an orangutan, not a gorilla. No. She means Mighty Max is sick. Mighty Max got a touch of the flu bug and he'll be fine. Dark? Dark goodbye? Dark, dark goodbye? What is it, hon? She's saying that the the other gorilla is going to die. Now wait a minute. Now just how sick is he, Mr. Fargo? I mean, have you had a vet out here to take a look at him? I said he's got the flu bug. Who you going to believe? Me or the ape? Smitty, close her up. Now, hold on, Mr. Fargo. You don't own this animal. I own the cage, so I got possession until someone claims it. You just want to keep her for your two-bit circus! Smitty, close her up. 'scuse me, boys. We'll come back. Don't cry. Toby and Jill love Casey. We'll come back! Come on. Tom and I have been watching you kids, and... Well... We just want you to know that we're going to do everything that we can to make sure Casey's okay. Like what? Try to find her real owner, first thing. But the circus is leaving tomorrow. I know that, Jill. Yeah, why can't we buy Casey from the circus? Kids. The circus doesn't own Casey. Remember? She's not theirs to sell. What about the animal keeper? Maybe we could pay him to let Casey go? Aw, no-no-no-no, wait a minute. Just hold on a minute. We're not about to kidnap a 200 pound ape. But it would only be for a little while. Honey. Somebody's bound to claim her when they see the TV reports, right? Right? What if they don't? Then the circus keeps her and she ends up just like that other gorilla. No, Jill. That's the end of it. He says no. [Tom] What was that? He just said, "See? I told you so." [Tom] Jill Tell him I'm sorry. Now, maybe you think your real father could perform miracles. But he's not here and I am and I'm tryin' the best I can. You tell him that, Jill. He just said that Daddy was gone. And now, he's our daddy. And he's doin' the best he can. So, uh, What do you think, Toby? We still going to do it? [Police on PA] Paging Dolly McKeever. Paging Dr. Dolly McKeever. Please come to the white courtesy telephone. Casey the orangutan is alive and well in Oregon. I repeat Casey has been located in Salem, Oregon. Can you hear me, Doctor? Oh, God! How many times do we get a happy ending in this business, huh? Oh, wow! Hurry, come on. Hurry. Casey and Max, it's Toby and Jill! Casey, be quiet. Shh! Be quiet! Mighty Max, be quiet! Shhh! Hurry, Toby, hurry! Shhh! Shh! Be quiet! Be quiet! Shhh! Quiet! Come on, hurry. Hurry up. [Jill] Come on. You can get it. [Smitty] Hey, kids! Get outta there! What are you kids doing in here?!

Whoa-ho-ho! [Fargo] Smitty. Pete. Oh, my gosh! Casey! Whoa-oh-oh-oh! AH! Hey! [Fargo] Whoa!!! Oh, my! What?! Can somebody call the police!? Let me go! Oh, Casey. Oh, oh, oh, Casey. Poor Casey. You must be Dr. McKeever. Yes, I am. This is my assistant, Trish Brown. Hi, Trish. This is Tom & Jeannie Wyler. Dr. McKeever, Trish Brown. Dr. Winter. We're sorry about all this. Oh, don't be. Listen. Anybody who'd try to rescue Casey from a cage in a circus, is a friend of mine forever. I just knew we were going to get arrested. Alright, kids, come on outta there. Come on. Casey! Jill, Toby, are you alright? We were just trying to save Casey. Casey. Oh, God. Toby. That's Dolly. She's been beaten. Get the truck in here. Casey, what happened? Who hurt you? We got all the roads blocked from Newberry's to Pine Creek. What now? Come, Casey. Come. Gorilla? Gorilla later. Come now. Want gorilla. Gorilla later, Casey. Come Yes, you can stay with Casey. Will you people move back?! How's he look? He look like he got beat up by a gorilla. Well, that's really nasty. Aww. Poor Casey. ...anything else? Oh, yeah. Gee, uh, They're going after Mighty Max. Let Casey find Mighty Max No, no. We can't do that. I'm sorry, but there's nothing I can do. I'm going to get something. For Casey's head. You stay with her, okay? Sheriff. Why can't you wait for the vet? I know he's on the way. Alright, he can catch up to us in the field. But that may be too late. I understand your concern, but what's the point of going... The point is we have a dangerous animal out there. Dolly! Dolly! They're gone! What?! Casey and Toby! I just left them for a minute! And so, as the day drags on, the sheriff's deputies and volunteers continue their unusual search. The animal's owner, Dr. Dolly McKeever, has arrived in Salem. But at this point, there has been no sign of her missing orangutan or 10 year old Toby Wyler or the ferocious and dangerous Mighty Max. This is Phil Meadows reporting, for Channel 3 News. They couldn't be a kitty to call out to, oh, no. Well, deaf or not, this kid has got some kind of guts. We found it about 50 yards in, but they're not here. Any sign of that vet yet? He just showed up. I sent him your way. He should be there any minute. I want to go with them. No. No, honey. No, your folks want you to stay here, okay? Boy, is Toby in trouble. Alright, sargeant, take your men and move off in that direction. We'll go this way. - Yes, sir. And be careful. -Yes, sir. Casey! Casey, come to Dolly. Bring Toby to Dolly, Casey! Casey! Casey, come to Dolly. Casey! Bring Toby! Casey! Bring Toby to Dolly! Casey! You should have brought some peanuts. Very funny, Sherman. Casey! Casey, come to Dolly! Casey! Bring Toby! Casey! Casey, come to Dolly! Casey! Casey! Bring Toby to Dolly! Casey! Shh! That's not Casey. Is that...over there! - C'mon. Ooof! Stop shooting! Casey! Casey! Casey! Please! Casey don't! Hold it! Hold it. Back off. Gimme some light. Call 'em, Toby. Call 'em. Day. Casey. Case. Kay. Kay. Casey. Please come. Casey. Please come. Casey. Please. Come. Casey. Please. Come. Oh, Casey. I'm so sorry. Let me see. Oh, Casey. [woman reporter] How is he, doctor? What's his condition? How is he, doctor? He's going to be just fine. He's going home with Dr. McKeever. Watch yourself. Get back! People, can you please stay back?! Give the kids a chance to say goodbye! Please?! Will you please stay back!? We're sad because we have to say goodbye now, Casey. Oh, we'll come to see you, we promise Goodbye, Casey. Goodbye. Goodbye, Casey. Goodbye. Ready, Dolly? Yeah. I don't know why we're all crying. It's so silly. Because you're family now. And we're going to see each other. Just like family. I love you for what you did for Casey and me. I thought that I had lost everything. Casey had two guardian angels. Right? Thank you. Thanks a lot. We'll be in touch. Goodbye, Casey. Goodbye. I love you. She and Mighty Max are going to be real happy. Probably even name their kids after us.
