You're supposed to slow down and prepare to stop. Yeah, and if I had, we'd still be sitting at the longest light in L.A. What's the hurry, Greg? Baby, I thought you married me for my sense of adventure. What's that? Tuna tartare. I thought this was being catered. (sighs) (groans) The things you do for that man. Did you pick up the cake? Oh! Oh, you know, that's the one thing I forgot. Look, I'll... I'll go get it right now. No, no, no, no, baby. You've been running around all day long. I'll get it for you. You relax. Oh, okay, then... I'll change the baby, then. No, I'll take care of him, too, before I go. Mmm. Yeah. Oh, Greg. Uh, honey... uh, do you... really want your sister to... stand here and watch this? (laughs): You guys. Hey, this is my house. You're the one visiting. (baby squeals happily) Greg, get on out of here. Guess where you're going today. Take care of you. And you, hey, slow down. I'm trying to take care of business. And you. (groans) Yeah, come on, baby. (knocking) Nikki? Donna? Greg? Hello? ALL: Congratulations! Was this your idea? Just relax and enjoy. (laughter) You know what I'm saying? Unbelievable. So, what does "partner" really mean? It means fully loaded Jag, that's what I'm talking about. CD changers, cruise control. Leather seats. There you go. There you go, that's what I'm talking about Absolutely! Absolutely. Excuse me, gentlemen? Oh. Thank you, sweetheart. Hors d'oeuvres. Thank you. Mmm! So, you see the Lakers the other night? Oh, oh, Shaq. Shaq's the man. Give me something. Shaq, yes, yes. And Kobe's just pretty in the air. He's just flowing, soaring... A butterfly, man. Dropping... Oh, the way you pour, baby, it's just, mmm. You are so bad. It just does something to me, baby. Everything you do, it just does something to me. (clinking on glass) Hey, why don't we take a picture. Okay? Picture, picture. Brian should be here. Well, he's not, so don't sweat it, Lisa. But he should be. Well, maybe he should have thought about that before he took off. He didn't take off, Robbie. All right! All right. We're gonna take a picture now, aren't we? Let's smile. Nikki, come on, get in here, girl. No, Mom, Mom, just let Nikki take the picture, okay? Okay. Come on, that's great. It's beautiful. Ready? Smile. Cheese! Cheese. That's beautiful. All right! Yes. (soft music playing) They act like they're starving. (laughs) I'm gonna grab some more dishes. Okay. ROBBIE: You look fantastic. I'll get you a drink-- and you can't say no. You better get out there, girl. Those women are out for blood. Robbie is an adult. But those are adult-sized leeches out there. (laughs) Who invited Stacey Peters anyway? I did. Why? (music continues) LISA: That's why. They're just talking. She's a friend of his from undergrad. Is that what he told you? Did you have something to add to that? (door opens) Well... Nikki, we need some more champagne out here. Okay. Great. Okay. I guess not. Thank you, honey. I'll walk you guys to the car. Great, great. You guys be safe. Congratulations, son. Thanks, Dad. Here's the keys. (sighs): Ah, girl. I wish I could stay longer. Me, too. I know. Oh. Bye, Isaac. (chuckles): Thanks for coming. (laughs) Whew! When are you coming back to San Francisco? I miss my roommate. I can't believe I lost you to Robbie. Girl, I'm gonna be there as soon as I get a chance, I promise. Hm. When I come back to L.A., maybe it'll be for something a little bit more festive? Like a wedding? Ah...? Oh...? (laughs): Oh... Yeah! We'll see. (chuckles) Okay. If you're riding with Daddy, you better get going, Lisa. (mocking): You better get going, Lisa. Don't let him do that to you, okay? Oh, my God. I ain't worried about him. Call me, okay? I'm gonna call you. Mwah! Mwah! Be safe up there. I will. Okay? Okay. Bye. (sighs) (frustrated groan) (laughs) Any of that tuna tartare left? Depends on how grateful you are. Mmm. (laughs) Mmm. So, what were you and Lisa getting into it about? Something about Brian? He left us, Nicole. I don't want to talk about him. Mom was getting a little tipsy, though, huh? Yeah. I saw her putting away all that champagne. I'll bet my mom won't get any sleep tonight. (laughs): That means Dad's not gonna get any sleep, either, you know? Nikki. What's going on? Thinking about this couple I saw this morning. Mm-hmm. About your parents' age-- they were celebrating an anniversary or something. But... as they sat there, they did not say one word to each other. I mean, they barely even looked at each other. They might as well have been eating alone. Maybe they had a fight. No, it wasn't like they were... angry or anything, just... familiar, you know? And the thing is, they looked like they had probably been through so much together. Made a home, put the kids through school, seen the world. But it all came down to that silent lunch. What are you getting at? After the kids, after the vacations and the houses and the boats... what's left? (laughs): I don't know what's left. I'm still working on the house and the boat. (groans): Oh... No ice cream. How do you see us, Robbie? Where do you see us in 20 years? I don't understand. I can see us happily married one day. With two, maybe three kids. And a five-bedroom house with a fireplace we'll never use. (laughs) And a chocolate Labrador named Nordstrom. I... I-I can't even think about marriage, Nicole. Calm down. Neither am I, but... indulge me a little bit here. I've given us enough consideration... to say I could spend the rest of my life with you. I can't have this conversation. You're stalling. I am not stalling-- I just haven't given it much thought. Really? Really. How does a person who never leaves anything to chance not think about his life in this way? And when it comes to your illustrious career, you have long-term plans and short-term plans, retirement plans, dinner plans, lunch plans. I mean, every day of this week was planned to the hour, so given your proclivity to anal retention, what plans, if any, have you considered about us? I... I don't know, okay? You don't know? I don't know. Who would know, then? I mean, what idiot wouldn't know what plans they've considered in their own thought-life? Who's an idiot? Don't attack me! You don't know whether or not at some point in your pathetic life, you've given any consideration to our future... together? I've given my future a lot of consideration. But I've just never considered a future together with you. ♪ ♪ (softly snoring) ♪ The 26th of December ♪ ♪ No ♪ (snoring continues) ♪ It was the fifth of July ♪ ♪ Oh, yes ♪ ♪ The second day of the new year ♪ ♪ And here come I... ♪ ♪ I'm always late for your party ♪ ♪ When ♪ ♪ Your celebration is through ♪ ♪ I'm home ♪ ♪ But you have got something better ♪ ♪ To do ♪ ♪ So I spend my daytime ♪ ♪ Alone with the sun ♪ ♪ And at night ♪ ♪ I just cuddle up with the moon ♪ ♪ Baby, when can I be ♪ ♪ A part of your fun ♪ ♪ Singing "Happy birthday" all out of tune? ♪ ♪ Soon. ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ Soon... ♪ (knocking) Nikki, you up? Did you work last night? I quit. Did you get my note? What note? Robbie called again last night. He thinks I know where you are. I suggest you screen your calls. (door shuts) (phone ringing) Hello? Hi, Robbie. What am I, the Lost and Found? When I find out her whereabouts, I'll tell her to call you. Mm-hmm. Tell Auntie Lin and Uncle Rob I say hello. Okay. All right. Bye. What is wrong with you? Either you're with him or you're not, and since you're here, my guess is that you're not. What do you think? I'm not. Then act like it. Unpack your things. Do your hair. Have you even looked into law school since you've been back? No. And the only reason why you haven't is because way back in the hidden crevices of your bleeding heart, you're still hoping that you and Robbie get back together. Are you writing me another damn note? Remember I told you I was subletting my place while I was gone? Well, it's about the tenant. What about her? The tenant... is my cousin. Which cousin? Not that cousin. His brother. Brian? You sublet to Brian? Lisa! What are you thinking? You just gave me a whole lecture about getting over Robbie and how am I supposed to do that with his brother living here? Look. Brian doesn't even know about you and Robbie, nor does he care. I'll pay your half of the rent. Just tell Brian he can't stay here. Nicole... (sing-song): you don't have a job... Look, we made arrangements way before you even got here. Nicole. Nikki! Nicole. Are you mad at me? (car horn honking) Nicole, I gotta go. My cab is outside. If I pay your half of the rent, Brian cannot stay here. I don't know. He's already made plans. I only have his voicemail. Work it out. Mm-hmm. If you want your job back, forget it. (soul music playing low) Now, what else can I do for you? Toomie, look. I know we see things differently and I recognize that I've made some mistakes, but I'm in a real bind. And...? And I need my job back. (sniffing) Do I smell cigarettes? Yes, I do and I don't like it. See, now, that's why you don't have your job now. Toomie, you run a club. People should be able to smoke in clubs. On my breaks, I'm entitled to smoke. Outside. Not in the bathroom. It was raining. I don't care, Nicole. There's no smoking on the premises whatsoever. Toomie, what kind of rule is that? People smoke in clubs. Not in Toomie's. Okay. Okay. Although you're infringing upon my civil liberties, I won't smoke inside anymore. So? So, give me my job back. I can't do that. Why not? Because I don't believe you. When I hired you three weeks ago, I asked you did you smoke, and you said no. Now, do you smoke? Yeah. Well, you see, now, I can't take that blatant disrespect, and guess what? I don't have to. I didn't always smoke, Toomie. Honestly. I've just been having a really hard time lately, and... and I really need my job back. I wouldn't be here if I didn't. Have a heart. (phone dialing) (answering machine beeps) Hello, Brian. This is Nicole, Lisa's roommate. She asked me to call you. There must have been some sort of mix-up or something because apparently, she sublet to someone else. So... Sorry it didn't work out. Bye.

Consider yourself lucky to be a female, 'cause ain't nobody gonna pay money for Owen and me to wait on them. Speak for yourself, Mr. Busboy, because people will pay money, and lots of it, to see me. I'm a comedian, a performer and an artist. This little waiter job-- temporary. One day, the two of y'all will be waiting on me. Because unlike you,garcon, I have a... vision. TOOMIE: Uh-huh. And I have a vision, too, because I can see both of you on the street real soon if you don't hurry up and set these tables. What you looking at? WALTER: I got skills, too, G. I'm not gonna be waiting tables forever either. Yeah, but, uh, broke people like you ain't got no choice. I mean, you have three jobs, man. I mean, when do you sleep? When do bankrupt people like you sleep? Uh, that's, morally bankrupt people like you sleep. Not money bankrupt people like you. (whispers): I'm sorry. Nicole, uh... you know anything about the cat performing tonight? I know something about this cat performing tonight. His dad is some hotshot attorney who's friends with Toomie's, so that's why homeboy's got the hookup. You see how that works? Nepotism-- I mean, is it my fault that my dad hauled scrap metal for a living, huh? What am I supposed to do to get a break, huh? Nicole, you ever heard of him? No, she ain't never heard of him. Ain't nobody ever heard of him. He's Toomie's friend, though. (funky music playing) (indistinct conversations) What are you doing? Ha! (laughing) Hey. How you doing, baby? I'm fine. I'm fine. Beautiful. How are you? See you. Look at you. (mutters) Yeah, drinks are on you tonight, buddy. Hey, what'd I tell you about wearing that loud jacket, man? What can I get for you fellas? A prettier waiter, man. You know what I'm saying? This is my section, but if you want another waiter, I can seat you at another section. Never mind, man. You know what? Just get me a glass of orange juice and, you know, a splash of grenadine. That's orange, not cranberry. You jacked that up the last time. You know, matter of fact, why don't you have the lady send the drinks, man? I gotta make a living, too, bro. Yeah, whatever, man. (mockingly): Have the lady send the drinks. (laughing) You're funny, dawg. Look over there. Pro running back Tim Minor is in my section and he wants you to wait on him. There goes my big tip. Who says he's a big tipper? The man's got millions. You figure he could spare a few bucks for service. Don't judge a book by its cover. Well, the book wants you to bring the drinks. (sighs) Lucky me. Look at you. Got your hair done, lipstick on, just doing it right. Come here, girl. Tim, I'm working. Yeah, I know, I just can't help myself. Try, okay? Hey, Nicole. Come here. You forgot something. What are y'all, slow? What is this? I don't play pro ball. You are the best thing that Toomie's got going, baby. And that's for real. Get your bad self out of here. Look at you. (whistles) (laughing) She's hot. She's what? God, what is he doing here? WALTER: That's the singer. You know, his dad's a friend of Tommie's. Shit! What's wrong? How much did he give you? What? How much did he give you? You're right. He is a big tipper. Oh, no, now, Nicole... Shh. He gave this to you. (applauding) TOOMIE: Thank you for coming out.

Tim Minor. In a major way, baby. Hey, look. I like your style, man. But you tend to use your falsetto a little bit too much. You might want to use your chest voice for those high notes. Right.

For my baby. Come here, girl. How you feeling? Give me a kiss. You know what? I was upstairs thinking, "You know, Tim, you are into this girl, man, but you don't know nothing about her." So why don't you, uh, tell me something about yourself? You know, 'cause I graduated from, uh, from Miami, '93, cum laude or something. I didn't even look at the certificate. But, you know, I went All-American, played a little ball, little success here and there. You know, girlies, the whole nine. And you know, I was the youngest player to ever win the Heisman Trophy. No, that's for real. And just this year they were talking about, "Yo, Tim, we want you to come and model "for the Heisman Trophy because we're gonna, you know, change the image a little bit." So look, look, look. I'm giving them something like this. Ka-kow. You know what I'm saying? Get the teeth and everything. You know, they do it up for a brother. My managers and agents are negotiating all that stuff. I think it's gonna be good. You know, for little kids and stuff. (sniffing) You smell good. How old are you? Nah, just kidding, just kidding. But you know what? I was thinking, you know, we can go upstairs... relax a little bit... unwind. You know, a brother just finished, uh, running a hot bath and all. You know, I was thinking you can get in there with me, scrub my feet or something, you know what I'm saying? We can just relax, sip a little Dom... You know what? What? Can you just take me home? Man, you're going to be working at this restaurant for a long time with jokes like that. Yo, thanks for trying. Listen... when he comes back out here, I'm going to let him know that I need to be onstage as soon as possible, 'cause I'm... You know what? Are you all talking or are you working? Now I want these things straight out here so they look nice. Nice and smooth. I'm trying to do that diamond look. Well, diamond look or no look, just straighten them out so they'll be nice like I told you. Hey, uh, Toomie, um... can I talk to you for a second? Does it have anything to do with clearing these chairs and tables? Not exactly. Then we don't have anything to talk about, do we? Toomie, just give him a chance. You got something to say, too? Because you're just barely hanging on. You know what? And in case you all have forgotten, the name on the marquee says Toomie's. Now, I've been running this place for 23 years and I don't remember any of you all being around to help me get it off the ground. So, I don't need you telling me what to do with my place of business. You think the world's supposed to stop just because you have an idea? Well, it don't work that way. You have to hustle and work hard. I hustled to get a college degree when colored folks couldn't get on a college campus unless they was the janitor. But not you all, you're so sensitive. You want the world on a platter. Well, you're in for a rude awakening. (muttering) (phone rings) The name on the marquee is Toomie's. Hey. Hey. You mind? You like tuna. Love it. Lived off this stuff for years on the road. Really? Where? Japan. So, um... do your folks know where you've been? So many questions. Well, I should have some information on the people I share living spaces with. So, when do you plan to go home? I have some business to do here and then I... plan to go back to Japan. To sing? If you call dressing up as a furry land creature at an unnamed Tokyo amusement park singing... I won't argue with you. Do your mom and dad know you work at an amusement park? It's temporary. I got cut from the auditions for the cabaret singers. Two left feet. My folks don't know I'm here. I'd like to keep it that way. Okay. Oh, by the way, I'm expecting a very important phone call from a Vanessa. Can you take down her home phone number for me? Sure. Thanks. (sighs) Hi, Robbie... Tate, please. This is Robbie. Hello? Well, I love the Bay area. Huh? The Bay area's got two of everything. What? Two baseball teams. Yeah. Two basketball teams. Yeah, and too many people on the street begging for money. (audience laughing) Everywhere you go, they got their hand out. "You got some spare change for some wine or beer?" I'm like, "No, shoot, that's what I use it for." (laughing) "'Cause I haven't eaten in so long, I forgot what food tastes like." What you tell them? Don't worry. Still taste the same, dawg. (laughing) Still taste the same. This woman came up to me with her little girl. What she ask you? Gonna ask me, "Can you help me get my daughter something to eat?" What'd you say? Hell naw. (laughing) You knew she was hungry before you left home. (laughing) You think he's funny? No. (laughs): No. You see the prob... (laughing) See, the thing is, Toomie ain't giving nobody a break. Or... least he ain't giving me a break. It's all good. (laughing) It's not funny. Hey. Hey. I didn't mean to wake you. It's okay. Expecting a phone call. From Vanessa? Yeah. I say you got to put some more water... (louder): You got to put some more water on there to get that spot up! And get them things off your ears. You're gonna ruin your eardrums. I'm using the splash and dry method like they do in the high-class... Okay, you high-class and get that spot. A little more muscle grease. Right there. Right there. Uh, Brian...? Can I talk to you for a second? What's up, man? (muttering) See, in high-class restaurants... waiters don't do this anyway. I ought to fire you. B... B. What? Yo. Uh... (clears throat) I was wondering if you'd let me open up for you? Open what? The show! You sing? No, I tell jokes, I'm a c... You've seen me around. You know I'm funny. Look... I've been at this joint a long time trying to get a break, but your boy, Toomie, ain't feeling me. Now, I see how he treats you. He likes you. So the only chance I got is if someone like you lets me open up for him. Oh. You funny? White people don't ever beat their kids. You ever see their kids? They be in the mall crying, "I want a toy! I want a toy!" Boy, not my mama, boy. My mama be like, "Here go your toy." (imitates gunshots) (rimshot) It's crazy. Uh... You ever go to the mall and see the security guard? Like, who's he protecting? Ain't nobody trying to break into Merry Go Round. I don't want no parachute pants from Merry Go Round. You ever see them pants, all them pockets? Michael Jackson in "Beat It" trying to flip pants and stuff. He ain't even got a gun. You ever go there? He ain't got no gun, nothing. Shoot. Toomie. Hey, y'all, give it up for the owner. Uh, Toomie. That's Toomie right there, y'all, right there. (applause) Give it up for him, huh? Making it happen here with that shiny ass suit on. (whispers): Get your ass off the stage. That's a nice, tight suit you got on there, Toomie. Boy, that's... Like an old civil rights suit. (chuckling) Shoot. Take off your suit and just be like, "Free at last." (laughing) Don't he look he...? He look like an old slave in that suit if you look at him. (laughing) You look like you got on 100% cotton suit that you picked. (laughing) Toomie's old, y'all. That brother's old. I looked in his yearbook. Him and Kunta was on the track team like this. (laughing) They won the 400-acres- and-a-mule dash. (laughing) There was a white man chasing them, "Go on!" (laughing) It's crazy. Toomie went to the prom with Harriet Tubman. They took the underground railroad. (laughing) No, I'm gonna leave Toomie alone. Toomie was nice enough to give me this job. You know, he really knows about restaurants 'cause he's old, he's been around, you know. If you look at the picture of The Last Supper, he's bringing Jesus some bread. (laughing) Old Toomie, boy, peanut head Toomie. My name is Owen, y'all. Thank you very much. Thanks for being here. (applause) I want to say a special thanks right now to Mr. Brian Tate for giving me my shot. Come on up here. Give it up to Brian Tate. (applause) (applause) Come on, Toomie. Hey, come on, you got to admit some of that was... That is an old suit. Yeah, mm-hmm. All right. (laughing) Was he mad? You did it. Oh, God. Bartender, I need something to drink! I just killed.

People come from all over and spend hours under the trees eating, drinking, chilling. I remember the first time I experienced them. It was incredible. I sensed this remarkable moment of clarity and tranquillity. Almost like God was calling me, saying, "Brian, pay attention. I'm here." Have you always... been like this? Like what? So... given to inspiration. You should have seen me in med school. You went to med school? Didn't finish. You look nice. Going out with Tim? Tim? No. No, Tim and I are on... hiatus. How come? When you end a relationship with someone you really and truly cared about... God help the unsuspecting guy who comes after. Still stuck on contestant number one, huh? No. Wait, wait, if we're going to be playing 20 questions, have you heard from your Vanessa? Vanessa? Yes. Vanessa. (chuckles) What's so funny? Some rich Japanese cat hired me to sing at his daughter's wedding here in San Francisco. Vanessa is supposed to sing with me. Vanessa's a friend of a friend. I don't know who she is, where she is or how to get in touch with her besides her voicemail. Speaking of music, uh... where can a tourist hear some good music around here? (playing classical music) BRIAN: They're all students? NICOLE: Grad students. I used to go there on my study breaks just to hear them practice. Reminds me of my mom's classes. She was a music teacher. Wow. If I could have that kind of training... Why med school anyway? Thought med school would make my dad happy. And I wanted to affect people. And you? You went to law school to work at Toomie's? Toomie's is the hotbed of creativity. Right. Besides, I'm not technically a lawyer. I... I didn't finish either. Why not? My mom got sick. How is she? She passed away last year. Sorry. Anyway... you don't strike me as the music school type. You're an artist. I wonder. What do you mean? People all over the world hire you to sing at weddings. One person, one wedding. I can't even do that right if Vanessa doesn't call. Sing solo. The man flew me halfway around the world to sing a duet. That's what I have to deliver. Nicole. What? You sang in the choir. Oh, wait. Wait a second. That was a long time ago. It's a very simple song. I'll teach you everything you need to know. Look, you went into music. I went into law. Vanessa is going to call you. Don't worry. So how's the Brian thing working out? Actually... he's kind of sweet. See there, I told you. You guys have a lot more in common than you realize. What do you mean? Well... Well what? Brian lost his mother, too. Mrs. Tate died?! No, not that mother. His birth mother. Brian and Robbie aren't really brothers. They're more like first cousins. What?! When Brian's real mother died Uncle Rob and Aunt Lindy took custody of him. But the thing is, nobody told Brian. When he applied for his passport and sent away for his birth certificate, that's when the shit hit the fan. And he hasn't been home since. Hmm... Oh, girl, I got to go. Sorry to just drop all that on you and run. You don't get a whole day off or something? Three days. I spent them in L.A. Uh... did you bring my allergy medicine? You went to L.A.? Uh-huh. I only saw Robbie once or twice. Didn't get a chance to spend much time, though. Can I get those pills? Lisa... Look, I don't know what this means-- if it means anything at all-- but when I ran into Robbie, he was with Stacy. Peters. Stacy... that's his friend from college. (bangs table) Nicole! Stacy is not just a friend from college. Stacy is an ex-fiancee. They were going to be married. They picked out the house and everything, but at the last minute Stacy backed out. Robbie didn't tell you about that? No. Hey. Hey. No Vanessa? Then... I guess it's time to move on. Nicole, you okay?

And start where? Some things are just too complicated right now. In Japan, I-I have a system set up. It works for me right now. Why change it? Why bother when it's easier to run? Who's running? One runaway can spot another runaway. And what exactly are you running from? I think there's something that you should know. I was involved... with... I was in a relationship... How do I begin to explain? Let me try. You believed so much in something that you thought was so true, yet discovered late in the game that it wasn't really true at all. Why dwell in the past? It's pretty daunting to... give your all to someone... who doesn't want it. What would it take? For what? To try again. Assurance. (chuckles) I mean, an escape clause. A 100% money-back guarantee, if you will. I need to know that I know that I know. That's no fun. You have to leave room for the surprises. Okay, that's 2023. 2029. This is it. It's nice. Seen enough? You? Brian. Your name is Brian. Oh, if you ain't the spittin' image of Claudia! (laughs): Oh, Brian! Oh, I'm Ruth. Ruth Daniels. Oh, please, come on across the street. (gasps): Brian! Me and your mama used to tear up them streets together. Ooh! She was my best friend. Oh, she was so dear to me. If your mother could see your face! She'd be so proud. I guess you've just got to fight them off, huh? (laughs) I'll be right back. (door opens and closes) Mm! I saw you down the block, but when you stopped in front of that house, that's when I knew. I got some pictures of your mother. No, that's me. (laughs) There she is. So pretty. And see? She used to sing in the choir. Ooh, she had a voice, make Aretha Franklin nervous.

Would you... Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey. Tell Toomie I had to go to L.A. Okay, did you talk to Brian? He was here? Yeah, he came in here, I sent him to the alley, and then he ran off... just like you did. Wait a second. Just wait here. You want me to keep trying Donna? I didn't know you and Robbie were together. We're not together anymore. We were, but things are different now, Brian. And I didn't tell you because I didn't plan for any of this. Me neither, Nicole. Aren't you ever gonna get tired of running? I'm already tired. Then don't. Not now. Not like this. Nikki, I got it working! I got... Brian. Like you did? What's going on here? Where you been? Where do you think you're going?

(steady beeping) Donna? Hey, baby. Nikki. (sighs) His, uh... his head hit the steering wheel when his car slipped off the road. His head injuries could be extensive or minor, but we won't know until he regains consciousness. Now all we can do is just wait. DONNA: Hey, baby. You got to wake up. I want to go dancing. Okay? You promised. Come on, baby, wake up. (softly): Sweetie. Robbie. Hey. You stayed here all night? How's Greg? You're late for work. Wait. Wait-wait. Where you going? I-I'll drive you. I'm staying here. Can I see you later? Just get some rest, okay? Wait a second. Wait a second. Can I talk to you for a second? Sit down. How you doing? I'm okay. Can I ask you something... about Brian? What? I haven't seen him or heard from him in two years... and when I do, he's with you. I just think somebody needs to explain something to me. (scoffs): Well, I ain't that somebody. (gasps): Nicole! Nicole, he opened his eyes! Come here. Come here! Greg, honey? It's Nicole. Why you crying, girl? (laughs, sniffles) Come here. Come on. I'm all right. I'm all right, baby. (crickets chirping) Now, if Dad saw you, he'd whip your tail. This was his lighter. Of all the things you could've held on to about that man, you gonna keep his doggone lighter. What's going on, Nik? You're smoking again. Look, I-I'm not trying to... get rid of you or anything, but, uh... there ain't no point in you hanging around here. You know, I know you love me and all that, but you gots to go. Now, can I get into your business a little more here? Can I stop you? Mm-mm. (sighs) You know, all the things that Mom and Dad left us... We keep 'em in our heart, or we hold onto 'em... ...but we take 'em in the future. We move forward. You understand? Now, last time you came home, it was to help Mama... to take care of her. She's gone now, Nik. And me? I'm not your responsibility, so you don't need to hang around here on my account. Now, if you're hanging around for that knucklehead Robbie, that's a different story. But I'm going to be fine. Now, you know... and I know Mama wouldn't have wanted you to quit school on our account, either, so I suggest... ...you go and you finish what you started. DONNA (calling): Hey, Greg! There goes the boss now. You understand what I'm saying to you here? Yeah. Hey. Hey. Thanks. What do you want from me, Robbie? Another chance. That's all I'm asking. I want you in my life, Nikki. Really? Then who is Stacey? A friend from undergrad? A year before us, Stacey and I were gonna get married. And, uh, it didn't work out. And then I started seeing you. And I, I just didn't have a chance to tell you about all that. What were you waiting for? A personal invitation? No, I just thought I still had feelings for Stacey. I thought she was something to me. She wasn't. And I thought you were something to me. And you're not. Does this have something to do with Brian? Because there's a lot you don't know about him. I'm sure he would say the same thing about you. You know, Nikki, Brian turned his back on his family, the only family he's ever known, and Mama and then Lisa and now you, y'all make excuses for him. Don't defend him 'cause you can't defend that. How are you qualified to judge him? Brian's just trying to make some sense out of his life, and he is entitled to do that. Well, he could have handled things a little differently. Well, you could have handled some things differently yourself. Quit punishing him. He's not as strong as you. He's stronger.

I'm sorry. BRIAN: It's okay. You and Robbie still... I decided to stick around and figure some things out for myself. You here to stay? Okay, what's going on? You've been moping around all day. I saw Brian last week. He said he was going to call. You didn't get my note? What note? This note. "Brian called." He wants you to meet him at Toomie's place tomorrow night. Lisa... Why didn't you tell me? I thought I did. You know I always post it. (music playing) Bonjour, ladies. Comment allez-vous? Oui, oui. I brought you a Chateauneuf from the Rideau Vineyard. It's a full-bodied red wine. It's on the house. Walter, this is my roommate Lisa. Lisa, that's Walter. Pleasure to meet you. Hi. How you doing? Enjoy. Thank you. Girl, he's cute.
