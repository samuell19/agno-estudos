THE CHERRY ORCHARD What? I don't know him. You've never met him? No. No? No. He's pretty tall... I thought you knew him. Anyway, he said he wanted to see The Cherry Orchard. Then why don't you bring him along? Forget it. Why not? He's just interested in chasing girls. Always. Why, last time... Anyway, forget it. I'll come alone. I feel so sleepy. I told you we should've gone to a hotel. Not in this uniform. That doesn't matter. Yes, it does. What's The Cherry Orchard? Don't you know? Not at all. It's not so easy to explain. Just an outline. Outline? It's simple, but complicated too. That's funny. But it is. Don't say who did it. It's not a mystery. Is that so? You really don't know? I told you, didn't I? The Cherry Orchard is a play by Anton Chekhov. Somewhere in Russia there's this estate called the Cherry Orchard. It's owned by some noble lady who's lost her fortune. Her name's Ranyevskaia. She's got this daughter, a foster daughter too. And she was born and bred in luxury. So even after she lost almost all her money, she goes to Paris and spends the rest. What are you doing? It's all right. No smoking. And? Go on. The story begins when she gets back from Paris. Her ex-servant, Lopakhin, is really rich now. He tells her to build cottages in the orchard and rent them out. But she doesn't, even though she's neck-deep in debt. Anyway, the cherry orchard is put up for auction. And who buys it? Lopakhin. He loved her all along. That's the story. Got it? That's interesting? Sure. It's a really famous play. I heard of it, just never read it. I'm not an expert, but I think it's interesting. Who chose it? It's an annual event here at our school. The same play every year. I'll come see it. Ten o'clock? Ten... What time is it now? Ten to eight. Ten to eight? Seven-fifty? They'll be here soon. Should I go? Sorry. Where's your car? Over there. No, there. The one-way road. There's no parking there. It should be okay. You got a ticket last time. Oh, that. It was just... Just what? They don't patrol on Sunday morning. Stop. No marks. They'll find out. Oh, no one'll notice. They will. They're very suspicious. You don't know. All right. I get it. See you. Wait. Aren't you in it? What? The play. Not at all? I'm the stage manager. The crew doesn't act? Usually not. That's too bad. Are you sure you understand? Sure. See you later. Yuko. Morning. You're here early. Well, I'm nervous. Me, too. When did you come? A little while ago. Around eight? What do you think? You look like a different person. You don't like it? It's nice. Really. I had it done last night. Have some sandwiches. Have you had breakfast? Not yet. Then let's eat together. Assorted sandwiches. Ham, eggs and fruit. Take whatever you want. Any one? Sure. Fruit? Maybe I shouldn't. Why? It could be the one you want. Then let's cut it in half. What else? Ham, please. But there's nothing to drink. I'll check the fridge. I'll go get something. I'll be right back. Milk coffee, OK? Sure, that's good. Yuko. Did you get your hair done for the play? Not really. So you're going to keep it after the play? Yes. I'll try to. Won't be easy, though. I don't know. I might have to give it up. But I don't really care if they won't let me. I'm leaving anyway. Are you quitting school? No, but I'm going to another college. But you've got it made. You've got really good grades. Most of us go to the college here after high school. The same place, the same faces. I'm sick of it. I want something new. A college with new faces all around. I know what you mean. That's natural. Natural. Are you going to Tokyo? I don't know yet. I envy you. I didn't say I was going to Tokyo. But getting out of your hometown is great, isn't it? Yeah, there's that, too. Are you going to Toho University? You're gonna study drama, right? That's a secret. Come on. Tell me. Good morning. What have you done to your hair? I didn't recognize you. Why'd you do it? No special reason. What happened? With your hair permed, you look really different. It changes your whole image. How? Like you're grown up. But it becomes you. Where'd you get it? Kawakami's. You know it? At Miyamae? I get mine done there. But it means trouble. You think so? What're you gonna tell the teachers? They'll tell you to get it cut. But then it'll turn out really short. Then she can just have it straightened. But it could hurt your hair. But hey, it's the school's anniversary. So what? That makes no difference. No? Well, we're doing The Cherry Orchard. I got it! You were just feeling rebellious. Rebellious? No. I feel like I've woken up. What? What do you mean? Nothing important. I'll be up on the roof. Good morning. Yuko? Yuko. Unbelievable. She looks completely different. What's wrong? She woke up. What? Woke up to what? Who knows? What's on her mind? She's got courage, though. Good morning. That's not the door. No? We changed our shoes. We'll carry the sofas. We thought it'd save time. I'm sorry. Forget it. You can come in. Hurry. Look. What a big room. It's nice to finally get a big room. Yeah, the old one is all filled up with stage stuff. It filled it right up. It looked like a barn. You're not gonna get married? Well, someday. Your parents would never forgive you if you didn't. True. Still, anything can happen. I just never even think about it. But it pops up all of a sudden. And there you are, married. Me? To an old man. No thanks! I can't believe Ayako's getting married. I always picture her in her high school uniform. She's already 24 now. But I haven't seen her for a long time. I see. Good morning. What's new? You heard about Sugiyama? I thought someone died. Me, too. Usually a call at midnight means someone died. Usually? Kaori. You heard the news, right? About what? Didn't anyone call you? I told Chiaki all about it last night. She called you, right? I stayed out last night with a friend of mine. What? You stayed out? Stayed out! My parents would bury me alive. Mine would skin me. That serious? She's got no idea! A kiss mark! No, it's not! Then what is it? It's a mosquito bite. Mosquito? Mosquito. Mosquito! It's not summer. It's a spring mosquito. Are there any spring mosquitoes? Yes, all year round. So it was a mosquito. Really? Forget it. What was the call about? An incident. The Sugiyama Incident. What happened? She was busted for smoking. She went to this coffee shop after school yesterday with her Seika High friends. She was smoking with them and got picked up. How did you find out? I called everybody and found out all about it. You sound pleased. Not pleased, but I'm not against good gossip. It's unbelievable. Smoking in uniform on a Saturday! She was a sitting duck. She should've played dumb with the cops. She didn't? No, she talked back. To the cops? Unbelievable. Never get them angry. Right. They called her parents. She didn't come home last night. We found out all about it. So that's the story. That's the morning bell? Yes. I'd almost forgotten how it sounds. Usually I come later. Have you seen Chiyo? Her fan club's here. Where is she? In class? She hasn't come yet. Is this for her? No, I brought it for us. Something I'm bringing her. You can come in and wait. No. We'll come later. Okay. Come again. She's late. Maybe because she's nervous. Nervous people get up early! No, they sleep late. Early, I say! Chiyo's gotten really popular. Thanks to her playing a man's role last fall. But this time she plays the heroine. That girl came to the rehearsal. Did she? No? No. I remember her hair. This one's different. Good morning. Miss Satom's coming. Good morning. Listen, everybody. Go to your classrooms now. After roll call, come back. Get going now. Hurry. Is everybody here? Probably. "Probably?" We take roll here too. Miss Satom. Kurata isn't here. You were wrong. "Probably!" Kurata isn't here yet? What's happened? I didn't recognize you. Where was I? She's probably just late. Just late. What else? Go on. I'll call her house. Sure. Excuse me. Miss Shimizu. You don't have to go. I'll talk to your teacher. Miss Satomi, Sugiyama isn't here yet. I know. Sit down. Sit down. Why the hair? Nothing. Just a perm. I think you've heard about Miss Sugiyama. I'm afraid we might be in some trouble. She's with the principal. Her parents, too. I've been thinking since I got the call. Will they cancel it? You mean- The Cherry Orchard? Cancelled? They'd never do that. Are you sure? Yes. Without The Cherry Orchard there's no anniversary. Don't worry, we'll just go on as we planned. After the play is over, we'll talk about your hair. It'll probably take a long time. Miss Jomaru. At rehearsal, the lighting was wrong. Did you know? Something's wrong with one of the switches. Sometimes it doesn't work. The one we use in Act II. It doesn't work. Just like that? So, why didn't you fix it? But she said she could manage. Who? Horiguchi. Nonsense! Timing is important. When did you find out? Last year. She said we can use it as it is and fix it later. So it's been broken for a year? But we use it only once a year. Just talking about it doesn't help. What's wrong with it? The circuit? I don't know. Of course not. A silly question. It's too late, anyway. What am I supposed to do first? Oh yes, call Kurata's house. I'm counting on you. I'm worried. You, too? We get all prepared, then no play. The vice-principal, Mr. Arita, and Sakaguchi will probably be against it. Miss Satomi said no cancellation, but I doubt she would speak up at a meeting. She's young, not too assertive - Sakaguchi and Arita will likely want to cancel it. Miss Satomi graduated from this school. Sakaguchi was her teacher. Really? Really. I didn't know that. For three years. Three? So Sakaguchi has real influence. One of his students is now on his staff. That's why he doesn't treat her like a teacher. I know what you mean. Do you think... it could be cancelled? I can't tell. Let's get ready. All right. Write the schedule on the blackboard. Good morning. Morning. You all alone? Shimizu was here. The others went to class. Were you running late? We were worried. Don't be. I'm all right. Will you go to class? Forget it. I'm already late. "Now I look at the walls" "for the first time with longing and affection." "My innocent childhood!" "I used to sleep in this nursery." "I woke up happy every morning." "The orchard was just..." "as it is now. All, all white!" "Oh, my orchard!" Chiyo, what happened? You missed roll call. I just got here. I fell asleep on the train and missed my station. What? You've got to keep it together. You're the lead. Hey, Chiyo! You'd better see the teacher. Hurry up. Why? He has a meeting. Some emergency conference. So hurry up. I didn't know. Isn't Miss Satomi coming? I don't know. Kaori, you go, too. On the double! I'm glad Chiyo got here. I've been worried. She wasn't any good at the rehearsal. Let's change. Miss Satomi was angry. Chiyo muffed her lines a lot. Nervous? Maybe. She was so good before. She changed a week ago. But everybody gets nervous. You're the except on. Get changed quickly. Is Chiyo here? Sugiyama, too. I saw her in the hallway. Why isn't she here? Who knows? She's probably too ashamed to show her face. That's going too far. Oh, yeah? Yeah. I don't think so. Don't get mad at me. I feel so good. Will Shin come? I think so. Did you make up? Not yet. Behave yourself. It wasn't my fault. Horiguchi. Check the lighting switch. I think I can manage. No excuses! Hurry up! Listen, Maki. "I'm on the front line." I'm broke. I spent all my money and it's the 14th. I have 430 yen to live on for ten days. 43 yen a day. My uncle took a picture of the baby just as it was coming out... What can you get for 43 yen? Why not get a loan? I did. I got my allowance in advance from my parents. What?! I borrowed a lot from my sister and brother. Sounds like a tragedy. It is a tragedy. So, Reiko, help me out and give me a loan. I'll pay you back. They say you never do. Shimizu hasn't changed yet? Miss Satomi hasn't come back. You slapped him? When he came to my house, he tried to get fresh. No! Yes. So I slapped him. It was so sudden... He got on top of me. But you've known him over a year. You kiss him, don't you? Well, yeah. It wasn't all his fault. He's a man. So I have to give in? No, I'm not saying you have to- But it'll hurt, right? It hurts like hell, right? It hurts so much you feel as if you were splitting. You're held tight-immobile... Were you and your boyfriend like that? No. Of course not. But I'm ready for it. His family runs a shop. They stay at home all day. Whenever I visit him, I meet his parents and grandparents. That's scary. I'm ready, but the environment isn't- I know what you mean. The environment- Chiyo's back. How was it? The play may be cancelled. No! The Cherry Orchard could get cancelled. Why? Miss Satomi was crying at the meeting. What?! It's true. You saw it, right? "A performance with such a disgraceful student" "would dishonor our anniversary." What the hell is that?! We're no sports club. She was crying? Arguing, too. Poor teacher! Is it over? Not yet. Let's go. To watch? Yes. Let's go. Us, too. Chiyo! Your fan club. Good luck with The Cherry Orchard. Will you let us take a picture afterwards? In your costume? Please. Of course. Thank you. Jomaru. Come on. Again? Excuse me. I have to go. Shimizu. I'm sorry. You all right? Yes. I'm okay. They went to the meeting room to see the argument. You're a member of the Drama Club, right? I'm Atsuko Nakano's sister. May I see her? Sorry. She's out. I brought some ice cream for all of you. Thank you. Eat them before they melt. Would you like to wait inside? Atsuko should be back soon. It's okay. I just came to bring this. Good luck on the play. Thank you. Thank you. Is there room for this in the fridge? Looks like there's enough for everyone. Yeah, there is. She doesn't look like Atsuko's sister, does she? No... She's beautiful. When Atsuko grows up, maybe she'll look like her. Maybe. There's too many. Miss Shimizu and Miss Sugiyama, come to the Course Consultation Room. I repeat. Miss Shimizu and Miss Sugiyama, come to the Course Consultation Room. What if it's cancelled? Sugiyama! I'm sorry. Atsuko, your sister was here. She brought these. Ice cream bars. Jomaru, get the rest out of the fridge. Save some for us. I'll be back. You have a sister. She left home before. She's getting married, so she came back. How old is she? Twenty-four. So she'll be a June bride. Yes."June bride". It sounds nice, right? Weddings cost a lot more in June. I don't think so. She's much older than you. Seven years. She's your only sister? She went to school here. Did she act, too? No, she didn't. She quit in the second year. Quit school? Why? I don't know. I was a little kid then. I heard her arguing with my parents, but I don't know why. It takes courage to quit. Sometimes I hate school, but I could never quit. She's brave. Yeah. But she wanted to get dressed up like a Russian too. She told me that. You didn't have to. You didn't have to apologize. But... Shimizu and Sugiyama, from the Drama Club. Shimizu and Sugiyama. Come to the Course Consultation Room at once. Will it be cancelled? I don't know. I didn't ever think this could happen. If we get cancelled, Sugiyama's "Sorry" won't be good enough. But it hasn't been decided yet. It's possible. And it might really happen. How were the teachers? I don't know, but... When we saw Miss Satomi, she was in tears. She said."Next year? They'll be gone then." That means, no play this year. I guess so. But how can they cancel it? It's the school anniversary. They always tell us to respect tradition. This play is our tradition. That's what Mr. Arita said. Did he back Miss Satomi? He said."We should do it no matter what." It sounds like him. He said it just for effect. He's like that. What counts is how it turns out. That's right. It's not so serious. Why all this talk? Sugiyama was to blame, but she apologized. I heard she refused to. Maybe she did. She must've apologized or they wouldn't have let her go. Of course. That's right. That doesn't matter. I was surprised to see Miss Satomi crying. The other teachers said, "There's always next year." But the seniors won't be here then. We'll be the seniors, whether we like it or not. And we'll do The Cherry Orchard on the anniversary. The cherry trees will be in full bloom again... Like they are this year... Like they were last year, and the year before... long before we were even born. Each year looks the same to Sakaguchi. He's been here forever. But the seniors have only this year. And next year will be ours. We'll have only one year. Miss Satomi said just that to Sakaguchi - crying. But that stubborn old fool would never understand. The cherry blossoms bloom the same way every year. I don't like it at all. The students come and go. But the blossoms stay here. It's not fair. Yet the cherry trees remind me of something. Of last year. What was I doing last year? The cherry blossoms make me recall lots of things. They sure do. They're reminders. So we won't be here one year from now. It's kind of sad. One year... Only one year to go. Miss Satomi's doing her best - she really is. She's really strict, though. Yes, really a strict director. But after practicing so hard, it'd be a shame not to do the play. Next spring, we'll remember how we wanted to do it. Let's go ahead. Miss Satomi's tears can't be for nothing. Her tears? We didn't see her crying. No, but... It's just like a teenage drama. Yeah, well, we are teenagers. No free one for me. Me neither. I got a free one. Me, too! Let's practice. No one's here. Tell me how it happened. How what happened? How you got arrested. It wasn't very dramatic. The girls form Seika High came by and started smoking. Then this cop came in and said: "You're high school girls, right?" and he picked us up. You weren't smoking? No, not yesterday. After all, I'm in The Cherry Orchard. And anyway, I'm trying to quit. They said differently. They love gossip. I think you're right. The Seika girls are interesting to talk to. They're so ill-mannered. That's their good point? Yes. If the teachers stop the play because of you, we'll riot and ruin the anniversary ceremony. Riot? Not just a boycott. We'll really riot. We'll demand to do The Cherry Orchard. But when push comes to shove, I doubt they'd really join me. Maybe I'll lock myself up in a classroom. Will you help me? Sure. Hey! I found them in our room. Give them to me. If those are found, it's goodbye Cherry Orchard for sure. Are they safe with you? Sure. I won't let them catch me twice. You had your hair permed. Very becoming. Thanks. Did the teachers say anything? No. I hid it. Like this. Anyway, I didn't get my hair done to impress the teachers. What did Kurata say? Chiyo. Why do you ask? Why? Because you wanted her to see it, right? You like her, don't you? What do you mean? Uh- just what I said. I don't know why, but I always thought you- Why did you think so? I can't explain, but... I've watched you. I don't mean you're a lesbian. Sugiyama. Why did you come here? I wanted to go to a coed school, but my father insisted. But a coed has problems, too. Like when you get your period and have to go to the bathroom and some of the boys notice. It happened to me when I was in junior high. This boy made fun of me. Yeah. He grabbed my napkin with a handkerchief. He kept shouting."What's this?" What a brat! He was a real jerk. I'll never forgive him, no matter what. He'll always be that nasty little boy waving that napkin. A boy I know made fun of a girl with big breasts until she cried. He might say now he was just a child back then, but I'll hate him forever. No one says you have to forgive him. That's why you chose a girls' school? I'd say that was the main reason. About the play... We're going to do it. Tell the others. We'll do the play. Huh. Shimizu. You can't riot now. Too bad? Too bad. Let's go. Maki, what about the party? The play isn't over yet. After it's over. If everything is all right. I wonder if Miss Satomi's stopped crying. The play hasn't been cancelled. What? So it's still on? Then say it's still on. Sorry. It's still on. So everyone get ready. Did you tell them? So you heard it. I'm sorry. Did you tell them the schedule? Not yet. Then tell them. Have your makeup and costumes on by quarter to. Gather in the rear of the hall by ten to. What time is it now? Half-past. Wait. Kurata. She's watching us. We can't forget our ice cream bars. This feels so good. This is what cherry blossoms smell like? They're in full bloom. All they have to do now is fall. Sugiyama. To tell you the truth, I didn't think much of you till today. I know. I've envied you. Because you do what I can't. But you got your hair permed. Maybe some of your bravery rubbed off. It's true, I do like Kurata. She's so honest, so nice. I'm happy when I'm with her. This is the smell of the cherry blossoms. We'd better go. Sorry to keep you waiting. Here, I'll take your picture. No time. The cancellation's been cancelled. You mean, the play's still on? You had me shocked for a second. No."cancelled cancellation." If the play's still on, say it's still on. Why? They mean the same thing. No! Look this way. We were determined. Did you check the switch? The last one. Who wants it? What? That was close. Sakaguchi. He's probably still around. What is it? This... This will cover your bust a little. Can I sew it on? I have needle and thread. Good. I thought you'd like it. I was big for my age too. They said I was precocious. Sometimes strangers touched me. And so I began walking stooped over. I'm tall, too. The costume is too small. I thought maybe you didn't mind. Or else you'd say something. I wish I had... ...more feminine charm, like you and Atsuko. Me? No one ever told me I was charming or cute. People have said I try hard. But that's not the kind of thing I want to hear. Finished. What do you think? Well? Why me for Ranyevskaia? The heroine... I thought you'd play it. What part would you have liked? Lopakhin, Gayev... anyone but a woman. I've never done a female role. I can't. I like your Ranyevskaia. Shimizu. I wish the play was cancelled. Even now, I'm hoping for something awful - An earthquake, a fire, anything to stop the play. Hold it! Wait a minute. We can't go in yet. The chairman's still speaking. What'll we do with this? Wait here. It won't be long. What's he talking about so long? About Sugiyama. He's not naming names. But he's blaming the teachers for thei."failure in guidance" Is it that big a problem? The news is pretty hot. Only a day old. Wow. They know her name, but say "a certain student of ours". What's the big deal? Yeah, why can't a high school student smoke in a coffee shop? What's Miss Satomi doing? She's gone. Gone? She must have escaped. She ran away. They bullied her. So wait here for a while. Enjoy the view. Where're you going? Miss Satomi's not here, so I'll talk with Shimizu. They bloom every year. "The whole of Russia is an orchard." "The earth is great." "There are many wonderful things." Be quiet! Yuko! Where is she? Still on the roof? Shimako. Where's Kurata? She was in her costume. Is she okay? What if she's worse than at rehearsal? Nothing can help her. She's so nervous. She'll be fine. We're talking about Chiyo. Of course she will. Somebody's going to tape the play? Somebody's father? Maybe Kubota's. Maki's? He looks like her. His eyes... He's her father for sure. They're leaving so soon. Is the PTA chairman still droning on? He's taking away our audience. Miss Satomi. Can we go in now? Is the speech over? No, not yet. Wait a little longer. Kaori was looking for you. She said you were missing. I'm here. You were gone. Don't worry about me. Worry about the play. Tell her so. Where are you going? I need some fresh air after listening to those idiots' hot air. "Is Leonid back?" "Is the estate sold? I want to know." "Such a calamity - it is so incredible." "I don't even know what to think. I feel quite lost." "I feel I could scream out loud this very moment." "Help me, Pyetia." "Help me." "Help me, Pyetia." It's just a joke, right? It's the first time. It rang before. You think it could be a real fire? Then no more play. Kurata. Sugiyama! Yasuko! You're looking cool. I thought you'd pushed the alarm. You or one of your pals. How did it go yesterday? My old man beat me up. The cops still got our I.D. papers. When will they return them? How are you? I got in a little trouble, but it's all right. You said there's this nice girl among your pals, here. Sure. Your big crush. It's not that kind of thing. You said so. Will she be in the play? Yes. A chambermaid. A maid? Such a small role? It's a good one. Really? What's your part? Her lover, back from Paris. See? Gross! Anyway, wait in the hall. We were there a while ago. They were talking about you. Sounds like you're in trouble. You sure you're okay? Sure. Don't worry about me. Go on. We've got to get ready. All right. Good luck. Did you see her? Not really. You didn't? Don't worry. It's okay. How long do we have to wait? Fifteen minutes or so. Okay. Tell the staff. I've been running all day long. Just like I did last year. I know. Then I'll be like you next year. What do you mean? What will I be next year? You'll be one year older next year. Well, sure. I'm eighteen years old today. Today's your birthday? Happy birthday. Thank you. Eighteen. Starting to get old... Come on, hurry. You're just like a doll. You're just like my sister. Aya? I'll call you Aya from now on. Not on the stage. Duh. I'm Varia. I know. Hey. You scared me. Go on into the auditorium. Anyone can see us from here. Nobody's around. You can't tell if anyone is watching or not. Who could be watching? You don't know anything about a girls' school. My cigarettes. And my lighter. Give them back to me. Oh, them. Yeah, them. The lighter was a gift. I can't lose it. I'll look for them later. Go on to the auditorium. Be sure now. All right. It was - Forget it. "So, as we're not likely to meet again," "I'd like to give you a bit of advice." "Don't throw your arms about." "Get rid of that habit of making gestures." "And all this talk, too, about building villas," "these calculations about summer residents," "who are going to turn into smallholders." "When all's said and done, I like you." "You've slender, delicate fingers, like an artist's." "A fine, sensitive soul." "Goodbye, my friend." "Thank you for everything." "I can let you have some money." "What for? I don't want it." "But you haven't any!" "Could you lend me money, just 240 rubles?" "I will pay the interest." "I have no money." "You will. I won't throw my hopes away." "He cares only about himself." "240 rubles to pay the interest." "I really don't have any." "Why not, Madam? It's a small sum." "All right. Leonid, give it to him." "All right. Open your pocket..." You said it! You said it! "Your pocket ." 240 yen? You said 240. I said 240 rubles. How much are 240 rubles in yen? About 600 pesos. How much yen? Why pesos? Let's go. Shall we go? Come on. Go ahead. I'll be right there. Thank you, for this. Nervous? A little. Nothing can stop it now. So get ready. I'm ready, but I've got butterflies in my stomach. That's all right. I've got too many lines, long lines. "My childhood! My innocent childhood!" "I used to sleep in this nursery." "I woke up happy every morning." "The orchard was just as it is now." "All, all white!" "Oh, my orchard!" "After the dark autumn and winter," "you're young and joyous again." "The angels haven't forsaken you." "If only this burden could be taken from me." "If only I could forget my past!" It'll be fine, right? How about a picture? I brought my camera. Where? Somewhere bright. Sure. Are we in the frame? About here. Down to here. I like you, Kurata. Is that bad? No. It's not bad. I like you a lot. I really like you. That makes me happy. Say it again. I like you. I really like you. I mean it. How about another shot? Closer? Closer. Sugiyama! Come quick! The curtain's going up. Shimizu and Kurata? Out there. Wait. Shimizu, Kurata! It's time! In a minute. Jomaru, get rid of these. You had them? They're yours? Uh? yes. I stole one. Let's go. It was fresh. I mean the play. Very fresh. I watched the rehearsal yesterday. Many teachers have directed it before, but yours was fresh, quite wonderful. Mr. Nakamura. I heard you were in a theatrical group. It was nothing. I wasn't an actor. I was backstage. When I was young. A long, long time ago. We did The Cherry Orchard, too. A few years after the War. Japan was poor then. It was odd to do a play about rich Russians. Our friends criticized us... "Why not face reality? Describe the real Japan!" But we could get money more easily for a classic like this. It helped us financially, and we could survive. And we hoped that someday we'd do a play relating to real life. But later I left the group and the whole theater world. So our annual Cherry Orchard is special to me - A reminder of my youth. I wonder if Shin is here. I saw him out there. Big audience! What a crowd! I'm suddenly nervous. Chiyo. You're beautiful. So tall and slender. You have real style. Hello, Varia. Hello, Anya. Hello, Mother. Hello, Madam. Hello, Doniasha. What are you doing? Show me your I.D. cards. We don't have any. Which way is the auditorium? Excuse us. Wait! Oh, no! Enough of this crap. He's not after us anymore. Let's go to the theater. Where are we? I don't know. I'm sick of this! Caught smoking again. Stupid! Sorry to have kept you waiting. We will now present our annual Founder's Day performance of the drama The Cherry Orchard by Anton Chekhov. Shimizu. This is your birthday, right? April 14th. Really? Congratulations! Thank you. Let's go.
