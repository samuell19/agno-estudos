Good morning. For the record, this hearing will be conducted via video conference call as you're currently being held in the Fort Madison correctional facility and will be recorded. First, I'd like to thank Ms. Royer of the Iowa District Attorney's Office. I'm being joined by Ms. Fancher and Mr. Davidson. Now, is this our understanding before we begin you'd like to make a statement. I know that some things are done on purpose and some things are done on accident. Part of me thinks that I shouldn't even be here. What I did... What I did was wrong. I wish that I could take back that day. But I can't. I tried blaming everyone else but it was me. I killed them. Shit. -Let me see it. -Mom, it's still hot. No, I know. Ow! Shit! You know, she probably didn't even write a will. She's got that big old property that she didn't do shit with. Wouldn't even occur to her to leave it to her only kin. -I don't think it was that bad. -Sweetie, you are too young to remember. Stop lying. If you hated her so much, why are we going? I don't hate her. She's my sister. I can't not go. Besides, it's bad enough people won't shut up about what your father did. -He was your husband. -Hey. Okay, try it now. It's the damn battery. We've come here today not because of a death but because of a life well lived. One lived with truth. That is something we should remember about death. Besides, we don't know when it comes. We must have said all we can say before that day. When that time comes... Aunt Addie was different from my mom. She used to tell me I wasn't gonna grow up to be like my dad. He used think she was right. I'm only known in this town because my dad is the only person serving a life sentence. It's like everyone knows the worst thing about you before you even open your mouth. What's your deal? -Why'd she leave? -Oh. An allergic reaction? I guess it was her time. -I don't know. -No. I, I mean, why'd she leave town? -What? -You guys both grew up here, why'd she go? I don't know, Chris. She was always kinda odd. She probably left thinking that she would fit in somewhere. I've excused you for the first part of the day. I don't need to get a call from the school... -Mom. -...telling me that you skipped again. I know! Hey. -What? -Good luck at the game tonight. I promise I'll be there, okay? Yeah. How about we ask Freeman's dad about how long it takes for bones to decompose? Where's your school spirit, Freeman? Whoo! Hey. I'm sorry. I stopped to have a quick drink with Craig and then this car wouldn't start. Anyway-- Hey, do you know Craig? Plumber? He's not a plumber. He's a contractor. -He cleans our toilet. -He does not clean our toilet. He fixed the bathroom. I hate our bathroom. It looks like shit. He's coming over tonight to watch a movie. You think maybe you could go hang out with your friends? I need to get beer and scratchers. You know, you don't have to make me feel so bad for trying to have a life. You could be doing the same thing. Freeman. Something new? I'll tell you what. Put some hair on that chest. Go on. Drink up. I'll take that, thank you. We're gonna have a beer and run. Let's go. Coming? Let's go. Whoo! Hey, there's one right here. - Hey! - Hey, hey, hey, hey! Hey, hey, hey! Whoo! Had your back there, Freeman. Here you go. It's all right here. - Come on. - Whoo! Alright, I gotta grab something. Let's go. Was that a-- Was that a 9mm? No, it's whiskey. No, no, the, the gun. Oh, you had a gun? No. My, my dad has a gun, though. He-- That he keeps under his pillow. Cool. -I shot it once. -Hmm. He, uh, he came home like super drunk and my mom was screaming so I, I-- I, I shot it in the air. Why didn't you shoot him? What the hell did you get a turkey for? To blow up. Yeah! My God, Freeman. You need another one? - Sure, yeah. - Here you go. Here you go. It's all right here. Whoo! Hey, we got one! Hey, hey! Whoo! I'm tired of throwing cans! Wanna throw some punches. How about you, Freeman? You wanna beat some ass? Who are we fighting? We? How about you and me? I'll even let you have the first swing. I don't wanna fight you, man. See that's your problem, Freeman. You're just scared. Haven't thrown a damn can all night. Pretty sure dad had some balls. Aright, Slim. Up here on your left. On my cue. Let's go. Come on, now. Good morning, Maddie bear. Make dottie! Dottie it is. Yay! -At the dot. -Uh-uh. Uh, I don't think so this morning. Fine. You win. All right. Here's dottie. Here you go, sweetheart. Let's give you a little syrup. Boom! Maddie girl and I are having pancakes. You want some? That's dottie. Really delicious! Here you go. Eat up. Soy milk and eat a little bit of fruit, okay? Mm-hmm. I thought you were gonna get the real milk. I don't want her drinking this stuff. It's just watered down. Call about the job? You want me to give you the number again or... - I'll call. - By the way, um, your dad called last night when you were out. Why do you say that like you didn't know where I was? Sorry. Last night, when you were helping Warren with his fence your dad called. Better? He wants to pick up Maddie this weekend. Yeah, it's not gonna work. It's her grandpa, Denny. Well, I'm her father. At least he's trying. God damn it! Guys, all set? Ready to go? -Mm-hmm. -Yeah. Uh, I was thinking we should get some ice cream. I actually was just talking to Diane Selby. She and Frank invited us over for late dinner. So I told them we're gonna do that. Sorry. Okay. Okay, let's go. But you can't say I'm not trying. Good girl. Alright, friends. I got the brewskies. Uh, did you want some more water or... - This is fine. - Okay. Okay. We're up. - Yeah. - Go. Uh, he's a football player. -I always said his name wrong. -Oh, Dan Marino. -Who says Dan Marino? -It was a mistake. Whatever, nobody cares about the name. Well, Dan Marino's one of the most famous-- -Anyways, okay, go, go, go! Let's go. -Okay, just-- I'm-- He was a politician. Um, you volunteered to canvas for him one summer. Oh, Walter Mondale. Denny door-knocked for Walter Mondale? - Come on. - He's very proud of it. So you probably shouldn't. -Yeah. -I was for a good cause or I thought. - He came in knocking on my door wearing this low white... - -Oh, hey. ...'old man' short sleeves. Buttoned up. No, we came in longer. Super cute, super nerdy. - Super my type. - So your type. -I know. -Okay. Good. Okay. - Are you ready? - Yeah, alright. Ah, let me see. That wasn't so bad. You don't-- Uh, no, it wasn't. Thank you for doing it. I appreciate that. I, I miss you. I miss... I missed you. I'm here. Brenda... Fuck, Freeman! Oh, shit. Let's go! Freeman! I'm sorry. Hello? What happened? Dear Lord. Hey, you know the Tillmans? Brenda Tillman. Works at the school. Anyway, um... they got into a horrible car accident last night. Mrs. Tillman and her daughter both died. I want you to go buy some flowers and drop it over at their house. I'll give you the address. Well, it's in the car. Hold on. - Riley, we need to talk. - Get outta my face, Freeman. No, what are we gonna do, man? We? Well, yeah. You know it was an accident. No, I don't. What I do know is that tomorrow I'm going to the station with my dad and I'm gonna tell him how some Freeman kid threw some shit up my window. You're on your own, Freeman. No, you know that was an accident. -The hell, man! -Come on! Get the fuck off my property. Go! Go! Shit! Hi, Den. It's me. I know you told me not to leave voice mails, but... I'm just worried. Shit. I'm not trying to st-- Who the hell are you? -Who the hell are you? -I'm, I'm, I'm Linda's son. Uh, I'm, I'm Addie's nephew. I didn't know anyone was here. You can't stay here. Who the hell are you? You don't even know who I am. What you need is you need to get the hell outta my house. What? Just 'cause you were sleeping with my aunt it means you get to stay here? What'd you say? Say that again. Say it again. It's not your house. Even if I didn't marry her that sure as hell doesn't give you permission to fucking squat here. Shit. Go on. - What? - I said go on. Go. Where? Look, man, I'm too old to feel bad, alright? Feelings is for your age. Good luck. Go to hell. Don't forget your bag. Denny! Denny? I know you're in there. I just wanna talk. Hey. - Ahh! What? - I'm so sorry. -Are you okay? -What, what are you doing? Well, I live here. What are you doing here? Uh, I... I thought this was a different property. So you sleep under my tree? - I'm travelling. - Oh, yeah? Where? Do you guys not, like, start with names around here? Not when they're irrelevant. Amy. It's nice to meet you, Amy. I'm Chris. And I gotta get going. Get in. Why? Do you got any other options, kid? Come on. Get in. Yeah. Uh, you okay if it's black? I don't got nothing to put in it. Yeah, that's fine. So, are you gonna tell me why you're here? Look, I don't need your help, man. I don't need to stay here. Where you gonna go, huh? Back home? After your nice little vacation in Clinton, Iowa. Hey, hey, hey. Come on, man. I'm just trying to help you. You gotta shoot straight with me, though. Why you running? Did you just get in a fight with your mom? What? You knock a girl up? Man! You is the problem with your generation, man. You guys can't handle your shit. It's pathetic. - You don't know me. - I don't know you. But I don't need to know you to know that you're scared. -I'm not scared. -Oh, yeah? Hey, let me tell you something, man. Everybody's scared. Sit down. Sit down. Come here. When you don't know... what you're scared of, that's when your problems are gonna start to haunt you. But the second you know what it is it's just like a ghost in a-- A bad dream. It's just gonna disappear. All right. Oh, hey. Excuse me. Hey. What's that? I know. I'm coming. I know. I had to come back. I had to come back to that. Mm-hmm. Okay. I gotta run. I got some business I gotta take care of. Got some clothes for you. Come outside with me. Uh, I'm gonna pay you for a day's work. You know how to work, right? Okay. See this shit here? There's stuff like this all over the farm. I want you to get it all gathered up, put it in the back of my truck. You can use that wheelbarrow right there. Okay? And when I come back... you're gonna tell me the truth. Or you'll be on your way. Okay? Alright, get to work. Oh, hey, you stay out of the shed here with the green wrenches. I mean it. You go in there I'm a rocks throw from the sheriff and you don't wanna be acquainted with him. Get to work. What are you doing? Working. You work for Bill? Yeah, well, I clean this place for free. Uh, sorry about the other day and for hounding you just now. There's just a lot going on. It's good to see you again. Look, I work down at Odie's in town. Maybe come by some time? I can sneak you out a beer. Call it even? Sure. So, what were you and that girl talking about? She think you're staying here? 'Cause you ain't. She's your neighbor. Yeah, I know exactly who she is. - I didn't tell her anything. - Yeah? Is that right? Huh? Mr. Secret Agent man? Time to go. Hey. Take it. Go on. 'Cause you got nothing to tell me, right? Good luck, partner. -I killed them. -No, you stop, stop! Stop right there. You made a mistake. Come on, man. You're telling me what? You, you mean to kill that mother and child? -No! -No. No, right. So this is where you gotta make a choice. You move on from this. From here. Okay? I told you if you were straight with me, that I'd help you out. I'm a man of my word. Now let's get you set up in the barn. We're gonna be smart about this. I mean, it's not the Renata but better than a brick coop. Oh, boy. This is my old car. Well, we gotta do something with that hair. Think you're good looking enough to pull that off? It's too risky to keep you up at the house. Everyone in this town talks. I wanna help you. But if you tell a soul -or you talk to that girl... -I got it. 'Cause if it's between you and me, kid, it's a no-brainer. We should probably figure this out soon. Sorry I'm, uh... If financing's an issue, -we have options. -I'm fine. The four-by-two comes in a wicker trim, okay? Please, just take your time. - Julie, what did I tell you? - Denny? Denny, it's Diane Selby. Hey, listen. Um... There's a memorial tomorrow at the school. I thought you might wanna... Okay. I tried calling earlier but, um... I guess you need rest. Yeah, that sounds fine. Good work. Dad? Dad, listen to me. You say you're gonna do something. But I'm just locked up here. I'm not playing your mind games. Dad? Sam, can I get another? Did you give up so soon? What are you sitting in the dark here for? What's wrong with you? Bill, can we talk? Tell you what, why don't you come and help me make dinner. While eating you can tell me whatever the hell you want. 'Cause I need somebody to rinse these. -Can you grab my reading glasses? -Yeah. - Here. - Thank you. Uh... I found your aunt's old recipe book. I'll tell you, man. She liked some weird shit. She ever talk about my dad? Ah, not to me, she didn't. Oh, are you allergic to peanut oil? I had to watch everything with your aunt. Yeah. You know, I did meet him once. My dad? Well, I didn't actually meet him. I-- I was with him at the race track. What? Oh, boy. There's a lot you don't know about your old man. Mm-hmm. This is before I met your aunt. Well, if he didn't win that first one and then the second one-- Third one. He just kept doing it and doing it. And it was just like his luck was just growing and growing. I watched this thing for hours, man. It was unbelievable. Yeah, but what happened? I'll tell you what happened. Last race of the day. He took everything and he... put it on that race. Put it on one, one dog. He lost it. - Damn! - -That's what we was all thinking but he takes out his knife grabs the bookie from behind. Knife, right to his nuts. And he says to him - "Is your manhood worth two grand?" Pissed his pants. Right then and there. It was amazing. I'll tell you something. You don't see that no more. Yeah, what's that? People who know what they want. They'd do anything to get it. I never heard anyone talk about my dad like that. Let me tell you something. You're a Freeman, okay? And you should be proud of that name. I went in the shed. Look, I know you told me not to. I can put two and two together. -You stole that stuff. -No, no. People who steal they got no moral code. Okay, they, they steal because they just got the itch. 'Cause they want more. Me? No. I have a system and it was clean. And I only took from people who took first. I wanna make money - and I wanna get the hell outta here. You wanna make money? I'm good. Take the beer. Take the beer. There's a lotta people around here. Flat out bullies. Ah-ha! You know the type I'm talking about. The ones that just like to take advantage, huh? You gotta tell me how you do it. Well... Maybe if you still got some of that Freeman luck tomorrow. I'll tell you some more stories. Hi, do you know how to get to Odie's? Perfect. Thank you. Shit! Jerk! Don't you use front doors where you're from? I didn't mean to scare you. You don't scare me. What? You just go from town to town cleaning people's barns? To get where? Uh, nowhere in particular. I don't just clean barns. How old are you? I'm 21. -Bullshit. -I am. Okay, there's nothing I hate more in this life than a liar. So, you can use the front door on your way out. I'm 17. Uh... My birthday was in May. See. Wasn't so hard, was it? So, was it your mom or your dad? Who'd you get in a fight with before you ran off? Look, Chris, you can be honest with me. We're closed. Oh, hey. I was gonna drop it off tomorrow. Chris, could you hand me that folder? Do you guys have a bathroom back here? Yeah, just around the corner. -Who's that? -No one. What's up? Well, I just had a few questions for you. Look, Skip, I told you everything I can remember and honestly, I'd rather forget. -So, are you getting it? -Only stealing from people who took first. Yeah? - You got it. - Okay, how do we do this? It's not the how. It's the who. Now, you see this is Paige's Hardware here. Used to be run by an honest couple. Once they died, everything went to their sons Jed and Jim. And these two drunks, they should've ran this place straight into the ground. But instead, jacked up the prices knowing that these poor farmers are not gonna go ten miles outta town. See? Why didn't anyone open a new one? Well, now, where are they gonna the money to do that? And you know what? Why-- This isn't the time to be philosophizing about capitalism, okay? You just follow my lead, we'll be good. Okay, you see this alley over here? Head down that alley way. You're gonna hang a right. There's a building on your left, double doors. Those double doors, always unlocked. You go in, all the hardware is lying under one wall, okay? East side. You'll see it. Just take whatever you can get. -Okay? -Yeah. Yeah, let's do this. Alright. Hey, wait, wait, wait. I got something for you. It's under the seat there. - No, I don't know. - Not the gun. Put the gun down. There's a bag under there. Yeah. What do you think of that? You like that jacket? That's my good luck charm. This was yours? I wore it. I want you to have it. Bill, I don't know. I don't-- I don't need this. You know, it's funny. Years ago, I tried giving it to my son. He didn't want it neither. Would've kept him out of the brick coop though, if he'd worn it. Put it on. Trust me? Yeah. You ready? Come on, boy. You'll be good. Okay. Need a ride? Sorry for your loss. Hey. Wanna go for a drink? Right. Let's get outta here. So, you're not in your crib. I mean, you're not even in the room. Four hours goes by, I can't find you anywhere. Get you guys another round? I'll have another. And, uh... I'll take another club soda. I can't keep up with my older brother, you know. -Where was I? -You do that a lot in front of mom? - Denny, I wasn't-- - Dad, I'm not upset. How many times did you cheat before you actually left? You really think people change? 'Cause the way I see it is, uh... Change is impossible. It stays in the blood. I'm doing the same shit you did. I gotta go, uh... Gotta go pick up some cigarettes and then I thought I'd maybe head over to the casino. I'll be back a little later. One second. - Hey. - Hi. You found the place. - This a bad time? - No. No, no, no. Don't be a stranger. Come on. Sorry about last night by the way. I didn't mean to run away like that. Yeah, you did. I mean, don't worry. My uncle has that effect on people. You're not the first boy to run just looking up. Your uncle's the Sheriff? Yeah. You know, when I was younger, I used to hear the craziest stories about him. Like what? I don't wanna scare you. Do you want something to drink? I have milk or water. Water's good. Is this your family? Was. I'm the little turd with ice cream on her face. You guys all look so happy. Yeah. I think we were. But then again, that was a long time ago. Half the people in that picture are either dead, drunk, or in prison. But... As you can tell, the picture's really old. So, you're just, uh... What? You're living here on your own? I've been taking care of myself for a really long time. Okay. It used to be my grandmother's place. But she died last fall. I'm sorry to hear that. Yeah, me too. I mean, uh, you don't have to be sorry. Uh, I hate when people are sorry about death like it's this new phenomenon. It's not. Do you like it? I mean, living all on your own. Um, yeah. Yes and no. Like, it's nice and it's quiet. And then, some nights, it's too quiet. Um, it's been a lot like that recently. My, uh, cousin was killed outside of the bar that I work in. Over watches. Or whatever he was selling that night. So, um, what are you... becoming a doctor? A nurse practitioner. I'm taking some classes at college this fall. Hmm. That's cute. Okay, one: not a little angel. Two: you've asked me a lotta questions. -I wanna know about you now. -Is that your uncle? Shit. He wasn't supposed to get here until six. Um, I'm sorry about this. Hey. What can I get you? Double bourbon. Ken, it's for you. Yeah? I told you not to call me here. I'll be home when I'm home! Just grab her and be... I just wanna do that every time she freaking calls. That your wife on the phone? Why? She harassing you too? Okay. You know, because marriage, it's a sacred bond. -What'd you say? -Just, you're the kinda guy that has no respect for his own family. You piece of fucking shit! What do you got for me? - Hey, tell him what I told you? - Simple. Just pass-- Hey, hey, hey, hey what are you doing? The hell you doing? Dude, you never count the money out in the open like that. It did feel pretty good though, didn't it? It felt great. More of this coming. Just gonna pay finder's fee.

Do you know what you are putting me through? The cops are showing up-- Hi, uh, this is... Denny Tillman calling. Brenda Tillman's husband. I was calling to see if, uh, you'd filled those positions and if you have a name. I was wondering if I could come in for an interview. Yeah, I could. Sure. Thank you. What characteristics do you have that would make you a loyal member of this team? Uh, I'm a hard worker. And I... I'm a team player and I think integrity is really... uh, really important. What? Are you stalking me now? No, I was just in the neighborhood. We can hang out. I just feel kinda gross. -So I need to change first, okay? -Cool. Here? Yeah. When I first moved here I thought that I was, like, fundamentally different. Because of my family, because of my past, the way I look. And the more that I thought about it, the more I just... Felt like you wanted to get out? Yeah. But here's the secret. The nice thing about living in a small town is that everyone has secrets. Everyone is hiding something. So I do my best to just not judge other people 'cause I try not to judge myself. Yeah, and what are you hiding? From you? Nothing. You could ask some questions. Amy, the guy that, um-- The guy that killed your cousin, do you not judge him? Haven't figure that one out yet. -You, uh got something in your hair. -No, no, no, no. No!

Amy, I gotta tell you something. The reason why I'm staying at Bill's place... I know you're gonna look at me differently after I tell you this. No, I'm serious. I need you to know, I didn't mean to hurt any-- Unbelievable. This is harassment, you know that? No, this is uncle talking to his niece. -Who's this stranger here? -He's a friend. Hey, a friend. What's your real name? When I talk to her, that's my blood. -But when I address you, it's the law, you hear? -You're being ridiculous. Amy, I need to talk to you about something. -Could you just give me a second? -Yeah. Thanks. Sheriff in the next town is finally ready to send me the pictures of that kid. We should have him in the morning. I guess, before he showed up here - he was out ranging-- - Can we just do this tomorrow? I will be all ears. Come by bright and early. Bill? You still live here? You still think that I'm a bully? And that all I do is take and take? Here. What is this? That's for that right there. Now it's yours. Not stolen. It just need a new engine. You still think I'm a bully? -Bill, I'm sorry. -No. Shit. Welcome to the family. Just like any family, keeping each member safe from harm is our number one priority. So let's take a look at some-- Hey! New guy! Yeah? I'm Carl. Oh. - Nice to meet you. - Yeah, good to meet you. How're you getting on? Yeah, I guess I'm doing fine. You, uh, you married? Yeah. Kids? No. Ah. They're a handful anyways, you know? I wouldn't trade that feeling for anything. Yeah, I, uh, think it's lunch. Oh, right on the dot. Alright, good talk. Alright. Look, we gotta talk. Bill, I'm, I'm sorry. I-- I shouldn't have said all that stuff yesterday. - Shit! - Bill. - Get in. Get in. - Please be silent. Please. Okay. Hey, tell me you're doing better than I am. I'm good. How are you? Good to see you. That kid working with you? - Breaking in all the time. - The kid? Yeah, yeah. I know where to find you. Yeah. Maybe I'll see you there a little later. - Well, we got till morning till he's back snooping again. - -What did he say? I think that niece said something to him. But you know, it's not important. What is, is just getting you outta here and on your feet. Now, I got something else for you. I gotta go into town to get it. I'll be back. Stay low. Okay. ♪ I can hear the car on the street ♪ ♪ Let them say goodbye ♪ ♪ We laughed and we wanna cry ♪ ♪ Singing you wanna die ♪ ♪ Left to wonder why ♪ ♪ Yeah, we'll let this day go by ♪ This should get you outta here and on your feet. Bill, no. This-- No, this is too much. - How long have you been holding on to that? -Too long, if you ask me. But you can't put a price on family. So, look, tomorrow... Get your ass in the family pawn. Okay? And get to Red. As soon as you get that money in your hands, I want you to hit the road like lighting. Highway's just shy of the down road there. Okay. Come on. It's not like we're not gonna see each other again, you know. Good luck, son. Hey! Chris! Chris! I heard what you did, Chris! Just-- Please tell me it's not true! You wouldn't hurt anyone. Just tell me why. It was an accident! You think I wanted to kill a mother and daughter? Take a man's entire family? Why a family? Hey. -Got something nice for you. -What's happening, kiddo? Just a minute. - Is that the same kid? - That's the one. Thanks, Red. Get that other stuff for me. No! You are done running, son. - Are you a murderer, boy? - No! Don't lie to me. Hey. Do you know what this means? This means I am like the father of the law. And I will protect it like my own kid. Red, where's that folder? The father has got to know the truth. I need to hear it from your own mouth. You're the one. Did you kill him? You think I'm stupid? Do you think I don't know? I got your whole shit on you right here. Now, if you took a life, you just tell me and I will be swift with yours. - I killed them. It was me! - Hey, hey! - You don't start crying on me now. I got no pity for people that kill for the sake of property. No, I, I didn't kill to steal. Oh, yeah. The hardware store. Fuller's lumber. We got tools and tape decks all over town. Hell, you even took Tom Fenley's pistol. That didn't even count. For it to count he was here before he got to us. They're a little more technically sound in our little farm town here. - That isn't me! - What other little shit - been wearing that jacket? - No, that's-- Huh? What're you gonna tell me now, boy? It's not mine. It's Bill's. I swear. I've had enough of your talking. Leave me! I swear! He was telling me about you just yesterday. That you at the barn as long as you did some work. And then you just split town! And you got the balls to show up at my niece's house after taking her cousin's life. Now, that is just sick. Wait, I didn't! You killed my nephew for this? I didn't! I swear! It wasn't me! I swear! I swear! Oh, shit! Amy was the only person who knew the real me. I didn't kill her cousin and she knew that. I mean... I was still guilty. She saved my life. It didn't matter though. All I could think about was Bill. I wanted him to die. That what you did? Eh? This your son? You set me up for him? I didn't set you up. You set yourself up. -I'm not playing your games anymore. -I didn't come to your house. -You came to mine. -Did you even marry my aunt? Just put the gun down, kid. You're already in enough trouble as it is. You put me through all of this to save him. No, that's where you're wrong, okay? A man is a man. Remember? Supposed to be able to handle his own shit. This one here? He gets caught on the job that I set up. He promises that he's gonna rat me out. Also even went to the Sheriff. You see, and the you came along. And so you used me. Doesn't matter who the hell it is. You use everybody. Oh, man. I just-- I whisper what I think. You whisper lies. Put that fucking gun down. Put it down. Get on your knees. I said, get on your knees, Bill! Well, go ahead. Yeah, go ahead, end me. Why don't you just end me like you did that mother and that little girl. You see her face? Why don't you pull one right in this coward over here? You know why? Because he just as bad you. You know what? You'll never find freedom. You'll never find your freedom. -Shut up! Shut up! -You'll never find freedom. You'll never find freedom. Do it. Do it! Kill me for my lies and set your sins free, motherfucker! When I was alone in that basement I finally broke. I blamed everyone else for what I did and now it was Bill. Then once I had him where I wanted him... He started talking and I realized he was just doing exactly what he told me he was gonna do the entire time. And no matter what he felt about me, if it came down between me and him he would choose himself every single time. Why didn't you shoot him? I was going to. I wanted to. The only difference between me and him was he'd been rang for a lot longer. I didn't wanna do that anymore. Why are you here? I always wanted a house like this. Not the house, but the, the feeling. All the lights on, the TV playing in the background with my mom and dad. I took that from you. I didn't mean to but I did. Whenever something would go wrong in my life, I'd blame my dad. And the it was my mom and Bill. It's just not their life, it's mine. I'm sorry, sir. I need to get going to the... Um... I, um... Sir, I know I don't deserve it. Please forgive me. I'm sorry. I'm so sorry. Thank you. You're a good husband. That's not true. For the record, this hearing will be conducted via video conference call as you're currently being held in the Fort Madison correctional facility. It is our understanding before we begin you'd like to make a statement. I understand that some things are accidents. And there are some things that are done... on purpose. I'm so sorry for what I did.
