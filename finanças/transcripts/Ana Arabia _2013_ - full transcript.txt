Hello, it's Yael. Is Itzik there? Tell him I'm in Giaffa. I'm going to Siam Hassan's house. The Holocaust survivor who converted to Islam, died... Exactly. Yes, could be interesting... I'll check the story and let you know. Sure. Thanks. Bye. Good morning. Can we help you? My name Yael, I'm doing a piece on Siam. May her memory be blessed. I am Yussef. I'm Siam's husband. Welcome. Nice to meet you. Thanks... for everything. Do you live here? Yes, anything wrong with it? We won't leave. Isn't it beautiful here? - Wonderful. We're having problems sometimes. Since you're here... Sometimes they don't let us... Don't talk too much. She's a journalist. Shut up, don't say silly stuff. Stop it. - Come with me. I'm sorry. - No problem. I feel good here. I go out just to work. I found a job... so I can buy food, cigarettes, clothes. I don't need much else. If I have a shekel, I buy food. Otherwise, I have my garden. But the district wants to throw me out. I told them that I won't go anywhere. I won't leave. What's your job? I retrieve wood, iron, aluminum, copper. Blocks. Waste building material, that's all. Did you think I worked in an office? I earn 30 shekels a day. Thank God. May Allah be blessed. Where are you from? Where were you born? Lady, we're from here. I don't know where my family is. I heard at the radio that my father is dead. My grandfather as well. I haven't heard anything about my uncles. Maybe they are... in Kuwait, or in Iraq or in Syria. In Jordan, in Turkey I have no idea. Is this all yours? - Yea. - All of it? There was my grandfather's carpentry shop here, too. If they would give me back my grandfather's carpentry shop... Those who do not study remain asses. I had to learn on my own what was good and what was evil. To help the ones who help me, to do good. I didn't learn it at school. That was what my father used to always tell me. He used to say: "If you have a guest, doesn't matter what happens, don't ever be angry with him. Even if he slaps you, even if you're bleeding. You have to smile, welcome him. Treat him well. Be welcoming, give him everything he wants." This is what I learned. And this is what I taught to my wife, may she rest in peace. I told her if they're looking for me, whether I'm at home or not, welcome them well, let them in, "Have a seat, please", give them what they ask for. Those who do not study remain asses. Do you have any children? I have... a son, Jihad, Walid, and a daughter called Miriam. Do you smoke? Yes, but I smoked before coming here, thanks. Do you want me to introduce you to my daughter? Sure, I would be pleased. Please. After you. Windy. My daughter Miriam. They say love is stronger than death. That's what people say. Those who love cannot control themselves. My parents relationship was like positive and negative. Like the electric current. Love controlled them, that's why they couldn't split up. People were telling her: "He's not good for you." They were bound. Love decided for them. There was nothing here. There were only rocks and garbage, filth everywhere. My mother arrived, decided to remove the rocks and create some flower beds. I helped her, to fill the empty spots with terrain, to plant trees. This way it would have been green, not yellow. She thought that by giving people what they lacked maybe they would have loved us. But it was no use, they didn't accept her. Treating her like an enemy. Wasn't she afraid? No, my mother always said: "Whoever enters Auschwitz as a coward, will leave a coward.? "who comes in as a liar will come out as a liar." I learned to never be afraid. Life has many paths. Everyone tries alternative ones. Not everyone stays on the main one, because we get fed up. But we want to know where the path will take us. Out of curiosity. Every day is a surprise. A gift. We don't think about it, we just walk. Man creates his own path. He faces the obstacles... and goes on. Some people say "he's a Jew, he's Arab", they discriminate. A lot of people used to ask my wife, may she rest in peace, "How can you live with an Arab?" But she didn't listen to them. It's true, she didn't listen. Miriam, where are the cigarettes? You didn't ask for them. I'll go to the market then. No, go to Ibrahim. People used to talk about it, then they got used to it. It was hard at the start, but those who knew us got used to it. But in the Fifties and Sixties... we were attacked often. - Who did? Friends. What were they saying? Her friends. They used to tell her: "Your husband is an Arab? We will kill him." They were saying that everyday. Every time we went to the harbor I thought she'd run away. But she didn't. No, she didn't. Do you know why? Why? Let me tell you a story, an old one. The story of Antar. Antar was a hero, like the ones in stories, like in the Bible, like Samson, every population has its own heroes. We Arabs have Antar. Antar was Shaddad's son. Shaddad was... the tribe's sheik. Do you know what is it? - Kinda like a king? - More or less. His father, Shaddad, fell in love with a black slave. Antar was a black slave, no one knew he was a hero, until one day every man went to war and he stayed at home with the women. Some foreigners arrived, singed the house, attacked him, he fought alone, and drove them away. He became a hero. - Why? - Why? Because he loved Abla. Abla was a free white woman and he was a black slave. - Nice story. - Nice story. Come, I'll introduce you to Sara. Sara is my son Jihad's wife. - Good morning. - Good morning. Are you wondering if the story is real, aren't you? I'm still trying to understand it. When she was born her mother succeeded in hiding her. And after the war they came here, they survived, and after some years they gave them an apartment. There were some Arabic workers on the construction site, obviously, she fell in love with Yussef and ran away with him. She was 15. The police came and took her away and she ran away again. In the end she stayed. I imagine she had no choice, she had a family, children... She gave them everything because she loved them. Gave them everything. Except the color of their skin. Come, let her be. Did he tell you about Antar? I heard about that. Are you his son? I'm Walid. Yael. Good morning. I used to be a fisherman. But the times have changed, Boats are back at the harbor. Not even the bigger ships are going out fishing. But we keep on looking for the black gold. Careful. Oil. There have been some explosions. They happened this morning. All the fishes are dying because of their explosions. The sea is really sick. The sea is sick... They just pour naphtha and oil in it, garbage, wastes, everything. And now the explosions... It hurts. But what can I do? I have a speaker for tomatoes. What has a stereo got to do with tomatoes? Nowadays people have no money. So the fruit vendors ask me to go around the city to announce where to buy cheap vegetables. They pay for the gas and give me fruit and vegetables for the whole family. That's nice! Is the car dead? No, I'll fix it. I'm an all rounder. Be careful. I see you two go along well. - Yea, I'm just looking around. - Do you like it? This is our home. Look at that horse. It's mine. Come. I'll show you something. - If you don't mind. - No problem. You see? He doesn't work anymore. Why you say? He did his part, he's free now. He's free, like everyone of us here. No one has real commitments. A lot of hens laid a lot of eggs everywhere here. There is an egg, but it's hard to find... We sell metal, that's how we make a living. Tell me, how old are you? - No offense. - How much would you say? You look young, about... 20 years old... 20 and something, right? More or less. You see, once they tried to give me in marriage to a 20 years old... - OK. - But she wanted an apartment, she wanted 100.000 $, I only had 99.000. Where could I get the rest? Doesn't matter... I live an easy life. Come, I'll show you, I retrieve all kinds of stuff. Look, it's beautiful. I sell them and make money, that's how we make a living. We don't need anything here. We have everything we need. - Chickens, a horse... - Everything. Look at the way it acts. It's small now. It will grow and become strong. That's crazy. It's strong, aggressive. Be careful. It attacks strangers, but she's not one. - She's part of the family - One of us. Here's Yussef. - Come, I made tea. - Where were you? I made some tea, come. - No one makes tea like him. - Really? Yes. Come. Tell me, what's with Sara? What happened to her? Sara was living in Nablus, she's living with us now. They cut her... water and electricity. They destroyed her house. What happened? I told you already, they cut her electricity and water. They destroyed her house. It's a ruin now. There are snakes there now, she's afraid of staying there alone, that's what she told me. So she came here to live with us. Where's the husband, your son? What can I tell you, everyone gets what the destiny wants for him, it's matter of destiny. If you behave well God will you give credit for that, If you behave badly God will punish you, you're done. I'm only looking for God, nothing else, I don't have money, neither does my brother. Because sometimes my brother asks me for stuff. I'm just looking for God and his clemency. Because he gave me life. God gave me life. And Sara? What happened to her? Listen, after... that she and my son Jihad broke up, she came to live with us. She used to go out at night. Once, I came home at 3:30 am and I saw her walking around with her hair uncombed. I looked at her and said: "Sara, what are you doing outside at a time like this?" She said: "I'm looking for my dogs." I didn't understand what she was doing outside, something wasn't right. And Jihad had a son and due daughters. The boy, from his first wife, not Sara... OK. Tried to split them up in every way. He told him: "If you don't divorce Sara, we will leave home." He told him: "OK, we will see." A week later he told him: "Either me and my sisters or Sara. You can't have everyone." He told him: "I need you." Then she started to hit her. He'd hit her in the morning, in the afternoon, at night. Until she got fed up and came here. A week later she told him: "Take your stuff, I'll take mine." They had chickens, goats, some turkeys, a sheep, they split up everything, he took his own stuff, she her owns, and left him. Yes. Thereafter Jihad decided to go back sailing. In Nablus. There is no sea in Nablus. But he decided to go back sailing still. He built a boat. He started to have pains, got sick, suffered asthma, every kind of disease, I don't even know the names. Until one day he fell and died. He was painting the boat he fell and died. End of story. We buried him. That's how his life ended. A sad story. And what about Sara? Sara was grieving. She loved him. In the end, if a woman spends so many years with a man he must mourn him, don't you think? - Hey, Hassan. - Hey. You know, we've been living here for 150 years, maybe, maybe even 300, a long time, dates back to our grandfather's grandfather's grandfather. Come, I'll show you something. Look, - here, my family... - Keep me some tea. Listen, my family used to live in that house. . Can you see it? - OK They ran away before the war. Jews and Arabs lived together, there were no differences, no... A Jewish woman used to live here a woman called Tovia. What can I tell you, everyone loved her, especially the kids, she'd give them candies, would even bake them cookies. They tell a story about her. During the war, many people ran away leaving a 8 months old baby behind here. The took him to her so that she'd raise him. And she did raise him as a Jewish woman would. He grew up and became a soldier in the Israeli army. Then, after the 1967 war, the parents came from Ramallah, they wanted to take him back. They were looking for him and found him here. And he said: "You left me when I was a baby, and now you tell me that you're my family?" He didn't want to know. Ne didn't even want to listen to that. He didn't want to know. "How can, you, blood of our blood, be an Israeli soldier? How can you fight your own family? Your brothers"? He had a brother of the same age. So he said: "You left me when I was really young so the rest doesn't matter." Do you understand? - Sure. - That's the story of that woman. Yes, Ghassan Kanafani wrote a book on that. - Ghassan Kanafani... Come. - On this story? Yes. Come and see my house. He wrote a book... - Yes, on this story. - OK. Ghassan Kanafani, a great Palestinian writer, murdered in Lebanon, may he rest in peace. Let me make you some tea. I'll be right back, okay? I need to make a call. . OK. - But make me some tea. - Don't you worry. - I'll drink it. - I'll be waiting. - Thanks. Itzik, you'll never believe it... Yes, I'm at Siam Hassas's house, It doesn't seem real to me what is happening here... No, you... All of these people have some stories... If I have a story? Of course I got one, I could have 4 here. Yes. Okay. I'll tell you everything. Yes. OK, laters. OK No, it's crazy. OK, thanks. Bye. Good weather, eh? Cold. Especially here with the wind. You can put what you picked up into the water. It will root entrench. - Really? - Yea, it will become a big flower, a beautiful one. A twig becomes a plant. Nature works more than men. Winter has just ended and plants are already sprouting. Even the fruits. Nature works fast. They'd rather stay underground, but that's life. That's the same with people. You can't live wherever you like. I didn't weed this year. Kids run everywhere and they uproot plants. I left the nettles so that they get stung. They leave garbage everywhere. I noticed that, by leaving weed behind, plants and trees grow better. So I just leave them there. Maybe they will help me kick out the rascals. So the nettles will grow. They don't like to run among nettles. I want to plant a grapevine here. I planted one last year, but it was a dry summer and it didn't survive. Otherwise I'd have grapes. They were inside some boxes, so I planted them with the boxes. I noticed that if they try to pull out, roots just twist. It's harder for plants to fix in place. You like plants Sure. It's simple. If there aren't plants there people won't throw away garbage They pollute the ground. It took me a year to clean it up. A year. I even planted this, a lemon. There is a big orchard up there... with cactus and... Go up there and have a look, it's really beautiful. Go there, it's the nicest place. Do you still see Jihad's friends? I switch roads to avoid them. Sooner or later it will pass. It will be forgotten. What happened? I don't want to meet them. That's it. I'd rather not think about it. It's healthier not to ruminate, always better to stay out of the mud. What do you want to forget? The failure. A failure is not a good memory, and a failure it was... If it hasn't been, everything would be different, but it was a failure... and it's painful, especially for a woman. Especially. Don't you think so? It was his race against mine. Jews and Arabs. His sons kept on trying to convince him that the path that he had chosen was wrong. In the end they succeeded But he wasn't a bad person, he just belonged to another world, that had its needs. So, that's the why it went? In a nutshell, that's how it went. But I don't want to go into details. As they say, silence is golden. I don't want to think about it. They story is underground already... it's for the best. This is not ours. What do you mean with "underground"? Jihad is dead. Men go from a girl to another, until they find the one who buries them. And until the end of their days they believe that the next one is going to be better. What will you do now? You're still young. You can find a new love. Love. Love for whom? You can't force yourself to love. You must not give your heart to someone you don't love. Your heart will then break. Get sick. You learn to get by without love. To go on with what you have. Yes, love is a gift. A gift from the heaven. It's not given to everyone. A few really know how to love. They do, but not in a real way. Love is the most beautiful thing in life. When I left Jihad I had a lot of projects. But most of the times I had to survive, to cope with the problems arising year by year. And I've never really done much. Now it's too late. There's nothing worth chasing. No? Why did you come here, Sara? Love. I didn't want my husband to suffer. I didn't want people to talk behind the back of the man I chose. So I told him: "Come, lets go where they'll treat you with respect." The jealousy was terrible. As terrible as it can be, jealousy is even worse when it lives in your home. It doesn't come and go, it stays there. Why's what? Never mind, it involved people who are still alive. But now you're happier, aren't you? Now I'm almost good, I don't have anymore problems. I found my peace. But I lived through hell. Years and years of hell. Sometimes, when I was asking myself: "God, will you give me the strength to avoid the humiliation?" Because he was humiliating me continuously. I felt like I was less than garbage. I really love this house, especially the orchard, that wild vegetation in the middle of the city. Sometimes, in the dark, in the silence, the night, you can hear the wind, the trees, people, dogs howling, goats... You just stay there and listen. What do you think about at night? Life. What else? What to do tomorrow, the day after, in a year, in a month, in a week. Tell me your name again. Yael. Yael, I have a question for you. Tell me. Who's getting a better treatment from the government? The Russians that have just arrived or us? For example, a guy that was a doctor in Russia, he's a street cleaner here. How do they treat him? Better than me. First of all he's blood of their blood. Does he work better than an Arab? Can a Russian place tiles? Can a lawyer pave a road? Or handle 100 kg of rocks? Let's suppose Arabs leave, let's suppose, how would they making a living? Dad, I'll bring this to Adel and be right back. - To Adel? - She needs it, she wants to go fishing. Be sure that she brings everything back... Immediately... - Alright. - Not in a month. I didn't forget about your tea. I made it. I'm dying for some tea. It's getting cold. Samira, my cousin's daughter, from Nablus, used to live in Nablus, now she came here. I wanted her to stay with me. When did she arrive from Nablus? When did she get to Nablus? She was born there. In what year? Her mother, I mean. - Her mother? - Yes, her family. She arrived with her father, in '48, 1948. OK. Is her mother younger than you? No, I'm older. I have an older sister, she lives near Haifa. How many? Three, due males and one female. Oh, a small family. No? No... - I have parents in Jordan,, - Thanks. in Egypt, in Kuwait, in Gaza... - Who lives in Gaza? - Cousins. I got 4.000 parents in Gaza and two in Kuwait, but most of them live in Gaza. By the way, it's delicious. I got parents all over the world. Who lives in Kuwait? My brother's son. But you just told me you have two sisters. - No... - I don't understand. - No, I see that. - From the beginning. He's not really my brother. - His mother is my aunt. - OK. My mother was his nanny, he has got my age, we're milk-brothers. My nanny-brother. Yes, a nanny-brother... My nanny-brother. Nanny, exactly. He's like a brother. - A nice thing. - I believe so. How did they get here from Nablus? Walid brought them. - Your son? - Yes. Didn't they have problems getting in? No, it went well. They got over the border without any problems, everything went smoothly. Have you been to Nablus recently? No, it's been 2 years. Why so? Are you afraid? Oh, heavens... - What's so funny? - What is there to be afraid of? Where should I be afraid on this side or the other? Us or them? Our police or theirs? Look... in the end, Arabs are just like Jews, they were exiled, then came back... the same stuff. I could be stoned, go to the hospital and be dead or... alive. Why did you want your cousin here? Listen, their father is dead, their mother is dead, their uncle is dead, their aunt is dead, their grandfather is dead, their grandmother is dead, they're left on their own, why didn't they have to come here? Her relatives take half the spots at the graveyard. I wish her good health. After the war, all my family ran to Galilea during the war They settled in Kerem Maharal. Igzim. The town was called El-Ajour, near Balad A-Sheikh, Hawasa. Hawasa is now called Ben Dor and Baland A-Sheikh is now called Tel Hanan. Many Bedouins lived there in that area, Al-Ajour, Nara, Nesher, right where the Carmel park is now. - Where the kibbutz Yagur is. - Yea, I know the area. There was no racism under the mandate. People weren't saying: "that one is Jewish, than one is an Arab, that is a christian, that one is a Bedouin." - It didn't exist! - There was respect back then. - Isn't it true? - Sure. Our home was open to guests all the time. Just like patriarch Abraham's house. There were no nationalistic discrimination. Never. The only thing that matters is respect. For us, respect, traditions, come first. But nowadays people would sell father and mother for money. - That's true. - Yea. Just to say, "Hey, I can..." There were no nationalistic discrimination. But I'm not like that. I would never go and live in an apartment and be without money because of the rent or to go shopping. Troubles, no money... Arguments with people, repossessions. I'd prefer a tent or a hut. During spring the water from the well, and during winter, keep warm with a bonfire - without all those troubles. - That's the best thing. I wouldn't even sell my family. I'd tell them go to work, to clean floors, to have fresh water and electricity. And say "I live here" without being the owner. - That's true. - So what did I do? What did I do here? I wouldn't live in a can of sardines or... in a hen-house like others do. Am I wrong? - Yes or no? - Sure. Life is simple. What do we want? What do we want? I want a woman to take these sheep. I will follow her or she will follow me. We'll have a little house and we'll train pigeons, we'll have a tree that chickens will climb upon, then I'll buy a donkey and a cowboy hat like in America. You don't think they have horses and donkeys in American? Yes, but they have bigger chances. Right? I like the simple life I live here. It's my dream. - We live out of the what land gives us. - Right. - Everything grows on its own. - The land, we already have it. We only need the dream. We have 4 sons, may they be blessed. And where's your wife? I divorced, I got rid of that whore. One day she brought home a guy he met on the street. She gave him the washing machine, the dry machine, all that we had. And he bought everything new. Understood? Why would you buy new stuff? It wasn't expensive, but it was new. - She didn't like it. - No. I like to live a simple life. I do everything with my hands, even the laundry. I like to like a simple life, that's what I like. - Where are your sons? - Where are my sons? She took them away in the USA. - You don't say. - - Right.. Do they still live there? Did you go visit them' - No. - Don't you see them? I have no reason to go to America. There's not a place where you can live as well as here. Look, there's everything here, good weather, everything is nice. - We're not lacking anything. - You're perfectly right. What's there, in America? There are lot of disasters in America, a lot of earthquakes. I've seen it on TV. The earth cracks open and many fall inside, dying, inside the earth. That doesn't happen here. - Why? - Why? Because we're in the Holy Land. Something like that can't happen in the Holy Land. He preserves us. That's true. Why is everyone fighting for this land? No one owns it, it's His. Only His. In Africa, in Zimbabwe, people die everyday. Our life here is so simple. Look how nice. The earth opens its jaws and many die there. What do we lack here? Nothing. Yussef? Why don't you find a nice job well paid and take care of your teeth? - Take care of yourself. - It's time to. Do I need the dentist? Yes, you do. - Just a little... - Do I need the dentist? Sure. He's serious. It's not severe, but you know... I went to many dentists but they didn't do anything. Why? - They didn't do anything. - Why? I don't have enough bone to keep the tooth still. - I have no gums. - Don't be silly. Healthy and strong, they can do anything you need. - I went to every... - Have you tried the national health service? - Have you? - I went to Gaza, to Gerico. - I went to Nablus... - Tel Aviv is a 5 minutes drive from the center, go to the clinic and tell them to fix your teeth. I'm telling you that I went to Ramallah, to Gerico, to Gaza, to Nablus, to... Out of 20 dentists no one wanted to treat me. - Well, then... - He doesn't have the money. You don't? The national health service told me: " Go to the hospital, - we'll do fifty-fifty. - Tell them you're gonna pay all of it by yourself. No one will treat me because I don't have enough money... - Do you want me to help you? - Honey, my problem isn't about money, it's about gums. What? Nowadays they take the bone of the knee or the big toe's one and they transplant it. Where's the problem? They put it in your mouth. Do you want me to have a bone of the foot in my mouth? - What are you talking about? - No big toes, no feet. Just go there, pay them, and they will take care of it. Are you crazy? A bone of the foot in the mouth? Never! It's your finger, isn't it? - I can't have a big toe in my mouth. - Would you do it? Take care of yourself Alright, OK. Just for you. Alright. Another coffee? I must... - Are you going already? - It's getting late. It has been nice. Come visit us again. Yael, is that your name? "Gazelle" Believe me, if only I was younger, I would have married you. For your smile. Will you come back? Do I have to make you tea? Why are you leaving? Stay. - Can I? - Please. But the main thing is that, I managed to stay afloat all my life. I've never got dirty. I've never tripped over. Never. My mother didn't put me in the world to get dirty, she has put me in the world so that I could become a lady. And it hasn't been easy at all. It hasn't been easy to stay afloat. I've been dreaming of our home for a while. In ruins. There's wind, and... webs, like if it was about to crumble, but it doesn't. It's just a dream. Yes. When my mother was sick I dreamed of her. - Your mother? - Yes. I dreamed of her three times in a row, she came visiting me during my dreams. And she cleaned the room with sodium hydroxide. She looked like the doctor. Her doctor. Same physique, same eye color. All of a sudden, I couldn't tell who my mother was, the child who grew up in Poland called Hanna Kilbanov... That then came to Israel and married my father Yussef. That was called Siam Hassan. Or the woman we loved, that everyone loved, that I would shorten as Ana. I miss her. Ana Arabia.
