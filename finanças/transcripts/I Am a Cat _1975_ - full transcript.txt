I AM A CAT If it's not yellow... it's not black... nor grey, or brown, not even a mix of those. Just a sort of color... hard to describe. Painting is so hard. You sure like to try new things: haiku, new-style poems, even mistake-filled English prose. Once archery, chanting, and then violin screech-screeching. And now, pictures! This is how you forget your restlessness... but it amounts to nothing. I'd say this picture is the same. How mean! I tend to do that. - That's spite. - No, it's your disgusting diligence. "Show nature as it is." Taught the Master Andrea Del Sarto. Drawing is seeing shapes and... colors clearly for the first time. Oh, that. That's a load of rubbish. Rubbish?! Didn't think you'd believe it. Tricked again! At a recent gathering... Harrison's "Theophano" came up. I said: Among historical novels, it's a masterpiece. When the heroine dies, the atmosphere is the epitome of the spectral. Then some know-it-all said, "Yes, that was great writing." Then I knew, like me... he hadn't read it either. But what if he had read it? I'd have said I confused it with another book. - What's that? - It's a cat. I know it's a cat. So this is a cat picture. Of course it is. - You're drawing this cat? - Yes. What did you think? - But why is it here? - It's been here a while. - No it hasn't. - Yes it has. It wandered in some time ago. - I didn't notice. - Been here as long as you. That's how it is. Cats are like that. - What's its name? - Doesn't have one yet. I am a cat. I don't yet have a name. If you look closely, I'm not well made. This fur and this face... squat nose and odd head. Taken offence? But you look back at me, and think... furless face, shiny as a kettle. Middle face so pointy, those holes blowing smoke. What a strange being! Right? Hey! What is it? Need a pee? Hey! Don't leave! You cat! Needing a pee now? You, you... Stupid cat! Hey, that's mine. Leonardo da Vinci said: "Wipe the dust from awareness." Go in the toilet, look at the rain-stained walls... amazing patterns appear! - More rubbish, right? - No, I'm sure of it. It's something he'd say. I get it, already. Don't you have to go to school? Why go on Sunday? Today is Sunday, you know. Oh yeah, that's right. You just can't quit teaching. - Stop being depressing! - Okay. It's not okay! It's my affair! Being a teacher. There's nothing worse. You want to quit, but with a wife and three little kids... how to cope? Kangetsu is here. - It's been too long. - Yes. Mr. Meitei, it's been too long. As a disciple of master Kushami, you seem quite busy. Quite. Lately I've been particularly busy, so haven't come this way. Which way have you been going? That's obvious. A slightly different way, right? What happened to your tooth? Well, I ate some mushrooms. - You ate what? - A little shiitake mushroom. When I bit into it, my tooth snapped off. Break your tooth on a shiitake... like an old geezer. Could be a haiku, but not a rhyme. - Not a haiku, either. - Is that so? You've repapered the screens. - Who did it? - The girl did. Quite a good job. This side is flat but the right is wrinkled. That's when she first began... and was inexperienced. That surface is so curved... an ordinary function can't express it. Is that so? For a physicist, you're very dogmatic. More than physics, this is metaphysics. Lately I've taken up the violin... and I am improving greatly. Recently, at a certain mansion, I performed with a piano... and a female violinist. I played quite well. - Who was the girl? - The daughter of a certain house. And between you and her, was love born? That's for the future to decide. Don't evade. Answer! Cut it out, Kushami. You sound envious. - Aren't you interested? - Yes I am. Well, then. A certain western novel said... men generally fall for... 70% of the women... they see and hear. That's the truth. Meitei remains a bachelor... out of disdain? No, from a broken heart. - When was that recital? - The end of last year. Talking of last year... I had a strange experience. - I was listening to Kangetsu. - Just listen. The evening of the 27th... while out posting a letter... a cold wind was blowing. A train came and passed. I was unbearably sad. End of the year. Despotism... senility... cruelty... all revolved in my head. Why people hang themselves? Must be at these times. Looking above me... I was just under that tree. - What is "that" tree? - The Hanging Tree! Whoever stands below it... gets the urge to hang himself; so it got that name. It had superb branches. I felt I had to hang someone there. I looked around me but nobody came. Its branches so exquisite. Images of dangling thrilled me. If nobody came... I'd hang myself. If you had, where would the satisfaction be? Right, I'd be dead. Then I went home but... I couldn't find a reason to go on living. So I returned... and was surprised to find... someone had got there first, and hanged himself. Just seconds ahead of me. Such a disappointment. - How interesting! - What's interesting about it? It's an easy thing to do. Now I know I'd been in the clutches of Death. According to James, the reality we see, the Unconscious, and Subconscious- are all mixed by Karmic Law. Has Jun Bayan's book arrived? Ask Osan, please. - Where is she? - Gone to the shop. - Kangetsu's here. - Yes, I know. Always such learned talk. Does he understand it? Of course not! - Is that fun for him? - I've no idea. We're short this month. Not possible. I paid the doctor, and the book seller. I need to keep some. You don't eat proper rice. Always eating bread and jam. - I don't eat jam often. - This month 8 tins. - 8 tins? - Yeah. I don't remember that! It's not just jam. We need other things too. - I suppose we do. - Please do something. - Where's the tea? - Yeah right. I'll bring it now. I arrived at the bridge with foreboding... Just now Kangetsu is talking about his strange... other-worldly experience. Other-worldly was it? Yes. Actually at a friend's... I met a woman who told me... my young lady... my young lady was sick. - That's the woman violinist, right? - Yes. I'd seen her 4 or 5 days ago, she got a fever and... in delirium - said my name. - Must be a cold! - It's nothing so simple. The doctor doesn't even know. I'm so worried. My organs are on strike. I went to Azuma Bridge. - Did you cross it? - No I didn't. Looking below... so dark I saw... only black moving water. Then from the river... my name was called. Kangetsuuu. - The young lady's voice, right? - That's correct. Are you calling me? Kangetsuuuu! Yeeeees! Kangetsuuu! Are you underwater? I'm coooming! - You jumped in? - Yes. But you're here now! That's because - when I jumped in, I... landed on the bridge. - Hello, Auntie. - Just in time. Take this to the study. - Guests? - Meitei and Kangetsu. - I don't want to. - Why not? I have reasons. They were hoping to see you. - But I don't want to. - Don't be shy. That's rude. Look what you did. A cloth! A cloth! So she's the daughter of the ice candy man down the road? That's so pass√©. Now he's Director Kaneda. How far have you two progressed? If it were just me, I'd say, but there's the other party. Not need to be coy! Madam, Kangetsu has confessed he's fallen in love. Well! Tell me all about it. - Here you are. - I was just about to leave. I should make a move too. Let's go together. But I have a stop to make. - Going to Kaneda's? - Yes. I mean... You mean their daughter Tomiko? - That's wonderful news. - What's so wonderful? We're close. We see them often. Doesn't he support that mob out back? Back! Back! Forward! Forward! For position and wealth he misuses education! A leech on society! So that's why instead of the convenient Rakunkan... you chose Bunmei Junior High? - Yes, with this one so near. - Not a matter of 'near' or 'far'! - But it is near, right? - Oh, I get it. Get what? - You'd prefer that tasteless Western Residence. I'm fine living here. I'll be going. Oh. Yukie is here. Yukie is from which side of the family, I wonder. I can't imagine she's... of your genetic line. What about your wife's? Nicer to look at her gene pool. But Yukie's shape suggests she's completely unrelated. She's my niece! Weren't you two leaving? At the Physics Institute... I'm to speak on the effect... of light on the frog's eye. I'd like your opinion so... please let me stay. I don't understand physics. With Yukie here, we couldn't possibly leave. - Your cat has gotten fat. - Huh? It's grown up is all. Who's the black cat? That's Rickshaw Blacky! The rickshaw man that frequents the Kanedas? In this neighborhood he's the toughest. Blacky dedicates his life... to chasing weasels. Cat's don't... don't they catch mice? Only the ordinary catch mice. - He's not ordinary? - Exactly. Doesn't chase them for gain. - Then why? - Don't you understand? Just to catch weasels! Cornering one he gets sprayed... enduring the stench, he will never quit. That's not easily done. - Do you spend your life watching cats? - Not exactly. On the corner, there's a mi-ke cat, a very special breed. Our cat seems taken with her. How does the mi-ke feel? Mi-ke is drawn to Blacky. - But looks up to ours. - Why? His master's an English teacher is why! Oh no! The dinner salmon is gone! Catastrophe! Swiped by Blacky. Wa it till he gets home! That ear-splitting voice... is the rickshaw man's wife. What's all the screaming? Heard you down the road! Nothing worse than that disgusting cat took our dinner. He's back. Where have you been? Stop hunting weasels and catch a mouse. After three days, dogs become loyal! He says he ain't a dog. It's been so long since... I've been able to see you ladies. That's the truth. Here you are. It seems your daughter's... suitor Mr. Kangetsu's frequenting... his friend the teacher. We've had many proposals... because of our standing we can't give her to just anyone. At a violin recital, that young man saw her and... Right, Tomiko? My husband's in business, a poor judge of men. We'd like you to watch and listen. A family's standing is important. I've been a secretary, but because... I'm the daughter of the... nephew of the mother of the... husband of the sister of the 13th Shogun, I understand your concerns. What a long list of connections. Mrs. Kaneko's husband is soon to be a minister! Where did you hear such a rumor? That's still in negotiation, one mustn't spread tales. Madam has said it herself. Have I really? That's right. It's in the papers. He's done a wonderful thing! I'll read... "KANEDA GIVES LARGE CONTRIBUTION" I hadn't read it yet. He gave a thousand yen. It was 1,200 yen. It's written there. Becoming minister is a great responsibility. I meant to accompany him... but I can't be involved. He's so busy running about! Mr. Kaneda, sorry to keep you waiting. She's held up talking with your wife. With my wife. Infuriating! Kangetsu is a physicist in graduate school. If he gets his doctorate, he'll be perfect. If not, we won't have him. Right, Tomiko? Yeah. Why does a man of prospects... visit that penniless teacher? Every morning when washing, that teacher makes sounds... like a strangled goose. Just like a ceramic badger, he always swings his towel... going to the bath house... all high and mighty. Better than everyone. He keeps a cat that looks just like its master; so filthy and disgusting, a horrible stray... imposing himself on our Mi-ke. Hey! Back again filthy cat. Unworthy tramp. How sneaky. Get out! As I said, Japan must become the greatest in Asia. - Right? - Yes of course. Just as you say. We must create a generation... unashamed to be citizens. - Just so. - Through education! Of course. Helping Rakunkan Junior High has... been for that purpose. I see. When I was transferred back... to the main department in Tokyo, and took on the Rakunkan cause, I had the same purpose, and I will give my all. - Madam. - Here's your check book. I've been imposing. Suzuki was a school mate of that English teacher. Is that so? I heard about the betrothal... and would like to lend support. - Thank you. She's going to the teacher's on... the matter of Kangetsu. I see. You must take great care! A little education tends to... make people conceited, and if poor, blame it on those with wealth! Are English teachers so poor? - Mr. Suzuki. - Yes? Please support my husband's bid... for prime ministership. I've smoothed the way directly to the top so... no worries! Thank you so much. Well, I must be going. How much shall I contribute? Osan, buy me some tobacco. Yes sir. Crying over such fluff. You know about me and Kangetsu? - You never hear anything. - That's not true. - When did you get that hairdo? - Today, Miss. Saucy for a parlor-maid. Isn't that a new collar? It's the one you gave me. Is that so? You said it was too plain for you. It sure looks good on you. - I'm vexed. - Much obliged. It's not a compliment! I'm very vexed. How could you accept something so becoming? - But... - How thoughtless! "We mustn't be found out." "You're leaving," said the girl with sad eyes. "Yes," answered the man. And to protect their love, descended the stone steps. The two never again spoke. Memories of all that passed... between them flooded in, heavy with sorrow... - What's wrong? Why the tears? - Oh, just a cold. My nose is running. Didn't know it was cold season. Hey. What's that Blacky doing? - Smashing his own nose. - His nose? But why? So he can't smell it when he gets sprayed by a weasel. Our cat is impressed. Though kept, cats never lose their wildness! Though delicate and obedient... they're so selfish. Marcus Aurelius said: "Women are uncontrollable much like cats." Great saying! - More rubbish. - Think so? - Isn't it? - You're right! Cats are cruel, I envy them not needing fellowship. Stop studying cats, observe your wife and kids. They're not worth studying. I only want to keep my rolls... as husband, father, and teacher... well separated, that's all. - You're here, Meitei. - Yes. Hello. Mrs. Kaneda wants to see you. What a nice house. Hey, is that a leak or the wood grain? - Such a strange pattern. - Definitely a leak. Who's this? He's my friend and Kangetsu's also. He's Mr. Meitei. - Is that so? - I'm his witness. There's no need for one. My husband should've come, but he's so busy... with not one, but many businesses. You probably know. - Kaneda. Do you know him? - Of course. He's a friend of my uncle. Came to our garden party. - Who is your uncle? - Baron Makiyama. You're Baron Makiyama's... I didn't know. I wasn't aware. - Please excuse my ignorance. - It's nothing. He's been such help to my husband. I've been rude. Get away! It's okay. You're fine. You're so cute. By the way, what sort of man is Kangetsu? Why do you ask? Perhaps it's about her daughter. - Yes, exactly. - You want to marry her to him. Not that I want to... - Did Kagetsu ask for her hand? - He didn't ask but... You think he wants to! I don't think he's averse to it. I know he's talked to you about it. Underhanded! You snoop! - Wasn't me. - Who did the snooping? The wife of the rickshaw man. - That woman, was it? - She's disgusting and stupid! Mr. Habakari! She is a woman. Watch your language. You say he's the one besotted. I heard differently. Right, Meitei? The affair at Azuma bridge? Oh. That was a friend I... had test Kangetsu. What? Kangetsuuu! Yeeees? Kangetsu was so ardent. What is his major study? In graduate school, the Earth's magnetic field. Studying that, can he get a doctorate? Does he need to? Common researchers are a dime a dozen! We can't say if he'll get it or not. - Anything else? - Recently he worked on... the mechanics of hanging. Hanging! That's dreadful. That won't make him a doctor. Hard, if he hanged himself. Is there anything easier? He did a treatise on the... stability of acorns in relation to heavenly bodies. - There's more about the... - That's enough! You've been no help at all. I shall repay you for your help. - Didn't you have a present... - I don't need it. I'm leaving! What was that? That face! That painted mouth like a hungry maul! Lipstick smeared all over. So conceited! - But your uncle a Baron! - That's rubbish. If he were, I'd be director of finance! That face is a crime. Left over from last century, shop soiled the next. - Face of a shrew. - A real bitch. - Has she left? - She left in a fury. Doesn't matter. Slurs about her face are mean. She is a lady. That's no lady, just a lout. What does she take me for? In order to be looked up to... you need to become a doctor. Should've got a doctorate. Right? Doctor? Impossible. I might become one yet. That's idiotic. With your stomach you won't live that long. Nothing to do with my stomach. Oh, you cat with dirty feet after I cleaned. Worthless thing. Get out! She doesn't like cats. What do you think she told our baby was a cat's cry? - Meow meow? - Woof woof. - Then how about dogs? - The same: woof woof. Well... You came together. Kangetsu and... - I know. - You do? Please, come in. When I was getting ready to come... Tofu came and said he wanted to come too. Hello. - And you, Dokusai? - Just by chance. We've decided to form... a group to study... literature and art. And would like you to join us. - Me? - Yes. Dokusai has joined too. - A philosopher! Why? - Because it's free. - In that case I'll join. - Then thank you. Is your family well? The same. We do and make do. We eat so it's okay. - It came. - What? - Paint smeared mouth. - Mouth? Your beloved's mother. Kaneda's wife came to ask about you. It must've been to ask if I would marry her daughter. But it was a big mistake. Kushami was prodded so... he had an asthma attack. I've never had asthma! Her daughter isn't worthy. Better give her up now. If you say so, I'll give her up. What if she then becomes sick? It'd be a crime. You mustn't marry her! What a stuck up windbag! - Have you been painting? - I've quit. Now I think I'll write. I got an illustrated card from you. The text far better than the out-of-perspective... waste of time painting. But your writing had insight... and sensitivity. I was impressed! That was art! - That's kind of you but... - Why not become a novelist? You should start with English translation. Luckily Western positivism is popular now. Saying the West is progressive... is popular but it's not true. River's unruly-build a bridge. Don't like a mountain? Dig a tunnel. Traffic's a pain so lay a track. Whatever they do they'll never be satisfied. Napoleon or Alexander. Conquest never brought satisfaction. The Japanese philosophy has... "Let things be as they are." If a mountain's in your way, rather than break it down, make it so you don't have to go. If family life is strained, leave it as it is and... find relief in another group. Through constant practice... we become ultra-conservative. - So, just sleep and wait? - No, this is very stimulating. I think man has two choices. Those two are Art and Love. - Have you changed the subject? - Just wait. The love between man and wife... represents one way. So not to marry and be happy... is turning one's back. Then I'm always turned around. - Marrying doesn't open the way. - Leave love aside. Art is the apex of man's activity. So I've created "Hai-theater". Hai-theater? What's that? Combine haiku and theater, you get hai-theater. Do you understand? And how is that done? The simplest is the best. First plant a willow tree on stage, a branch stuck out to the right... with a crow perched upon it. Would a crow stay still? We'd tie its leg with a string. - What happens then? - Below it we place a wash tub. inside that a beautiful girl with a wash cloth. That's a bit risqu√©. Wouldn't the cops object? Not if we were legitimate. Art school models are the same. That's for practice, not for watching. If teachers think like that then Japan's in bad shape. Never mind that. What happens next? Master Takahama comes out. We'd like Kangetsu to play him. You'd enter stage right. Seeing the woman bathing the raven, falls in love. - That's how it ends? - That's right. That's a bit sparse. I'd like a bit more drama. I think it's fine. Superb! - Thank you so much. - Is it really Kyoshi's poem? Yes, it's famous. But a crow falling for a woman... What's that about? As a physicist, isn't it unreal? - I don't think it unreal at all. - Why is that? Kyoshi saw the girl and fell in love. It's not about the crow. Letting a crow assume one's feelings without egotism makes it... a truly positivistic poem. I wonder who plays the girl? I think you'll all agree... Kushami's niece Yukie should. Yukie? That's weird. It's impossible. It'd ruin it. She's your niece so you can't... see her as a woman. You need to be objective. She's not only beautiful, she's young and pure; the perfect image of woman. A holy statue, a madonna. What has Sampei... sent us I wonder? They're yams. When did the thief break in? - What time was it? - What time did you go to bed? - It was... after you. - I retired before you. - So the robber came in. - Must've been at night. We know it was night! This policeman wants to know what time it was! If we'd known, we'd not have been robbed! So the time is unknown. Correct? I see. Then you must write the precise time you closed up and went to bed. That the thief opened the shutters, entered and... how many things he took of what value and... file a complaint. Not a report. A complaint! Must we list each item? Yes. How many of each and their value. Make an itemized list. My silk surcoat was taken, given me by my aunt... and irreplaceable. Don't need a lecture! How much would a box of yams be? - He even took the yams? - That's right. Does he plans to boil them or make a stew? I have no idea. Go ask him. Please list cash separately. Not much. Just my wallet. And my money too. Your money? My duty's done... Thank you for your time. What did you mean... your money? - My nest egg. - Nest egg? - You had one? - We have three small kids. What if something happened? You mean if I died? It could be anything. That so? I won't always be a teacher. I might quit! Have you thought... No, I never imagined. You don't understand me. That's why you happily get so fat. Damn it all! - You Otanchin Palaeologus! - What's an Otanchin Palaeologus? - You wanna know? - I do. It's a triple idiot! Sampei. Sorry we've been busy since morning. Sorry about the burglary. Yes, but you must be tired. I'm fine. He took the yams I sent? Along with other things. Will Master have to go into debt? When I was staying here... he was often in debt too. Better if this cat had been a dog. That's right. Eating all the time, never catching a single mouse. Then throw him away! Or give him to me. I'll cook him and eat him. - You eat cats? - Yes I have. They're yummy. That scared him off. He understood. No way! Master. It's been a long time. For both of us. What are doing in Tokyo? By Suzuki's request, I've come... to work for the great Kaneda. What? For Kaneda? Be quiet out there! We have a guest. You know Kaneda too. I'm going into business. A burglar causes you such grief. Why not get into business or politics? - I hate them both. - He hates everything. - Except his wife. Yeah? - I hate her the most! Liar. In your heart you love her. And you want money. Isn't that so? You stupid idiot! I made him angry. Because you told him the truth. Oh. It's you. You're lucky not having to go to school. What? Teaching is easy? Even a cat could do it? Why's that? Because I just do the same thing every day? That's what's hard! What's that? Don't be selfish? Why not? Stop being a jerk and quit. You sure are blunt. Still not ready. You'll be late for school. - I'm not going. - There you go again. I don't want to. I have good reason. Reason? Yes. When I get there Kozu brings me tea. Tea? What's wrong with that? When he does, he always... sticks his thumb in the cup. His dirty fat thumb. Five centimeters into my tea. Is that all it was? All? I should drink that dirty tea? If so, you drink it! - Then don't drink it! - It's the same at lunch! If you have something to say, come out with it. It's hard to talk about. It's okay. I won't press. Well, Hamada kept asking to borrow it. - What? Your money? - I lent him my name. And what did he do with it? He sent a love letter. A love letter? Be clearer. Who was it sent to? A girl named Tomiko Kaneda. - Kaneda? The businessman? - Yes. Their daughter is so stuck up. He played a trick on her. He said his own name was so lowly... a distinguished surname would be better. So I lent him mine. - Are you two known by the girl? - Not at all. That was mean. I'm so worried I can't sleep. - Did he write the school name? - No, sir. Not even the address. That's good. If our school is involved... it'd be bad for our reputation. - Master, will I be expelled? - Let's see... The principal wants to see you. Is Furui one of your students? Why did he send a love letter to the daughter... of a respected businessman? What are you teaching your students? How did you know it was one of our students? - It was written on our stationary. - Now that was stupid. Stupid? Stupid won't do! The Kanedas have sent us a complaint. Look into it! - And then do what? - If it's true, we expel him. - What if he denies it? - Just check into it. - Any objections? - Not at all. That conceited jerk. It only means many men are attracted to you. I think so too. *poem* Quite a famous poem. But Furui Buemon is such an old fashioned name. Show it to me. Tomiko! Bunmei Jr High is where that penniless teacher works. He can't be much of a student. How is Kushami's stomach? I haven't the slightest idea. He won't drink his medicine. But he has no poison in his heart. Poison wouldn't collect in that gizzard of his. Welcome home. Kangetsu has begun his doctoral thesis. What? Is that true? Isn't that wonderful? He's swallowed the bait to marry the Kaneda girl. After all our warnings. He never fails to surprise. What is his thesis on? - Those frog eyes. - Frog eyes? To make a lens like the frog eye, he's now polishing glass balls. Finishing will take 20 years. What? 20 years? - That Furui... - Buemon. You not wanting him to be... expelled seems more serious to... you than your desire to quit. Don't be stupid. You can't compare teacher to pupil. But that's like the difference between exit and entrance. - Aren't you going to help him? - Me? Isn't Buemon counting on you? Yes, but the principal wants to expel him. That's why you should help him. Good pupils don't need teachers. So vulnerable you must lend a hand. The accusation is unproven. It was just a prank. Probably good for Kaneda. What can I do? As long as you're a teacher, act like a teacher. What was that? Youuu idiot! Who hit this ball into my house? Not going to show yourself? Hiding is cowardly! Your cat now thinks you're cool. A male writing to a female... is not against the law. Obscenity is different. Every letter a man writes to a woman is somewhat obscene. - And you call yourself a teacher. - I am! - Then follow my orders! - I refuse. - You're against expulsion? - I am. You're not teaching students. The decision should be left to the teacher. It's now popular to hit a ball with a wooden pestle. That's what hit him. Fortunately, it was "his" head. Instant Karma! He's still... against the marriage plans. Opposing you on this. He's such a blockhead! I'll tell my husband. He'll shut him up! - I'm done for. - That's not possible. Will medicine help? It usually does. Don't. You're being examined... Your anger is what makes them enjoy making noise. That does it! Hooligans! What do you think... Get out you idiots! Hey! Stop that! Stop! Now! Master! We're not finished. It's too much fun. That's enough! Those who disobey... in accordance with paragraph 3... will be expelled! - Are you a teacher? - That's right. Did you order this? No! Whatever. I want you to forbid... them from entering my place. Exercise is part of the curriculum, and can not be forbidden. I'll scold them and... in future have them fetch balls... by going to your door and asking for permission. How's that? In that case, it's fine. I'll see to it. Gather the balls! Can't you stop this conduct? You mean discipline control? Discipline control? That's what it's called. Fall in! Present and accounted for! Attention! Salute! About Face! To the school... March! Those kids scare me. Men! Never know what they'll do. Are they trying to break me? It's a case of nerves... often manifesting in delusions... of persecution. - Are you talking about me? - It's the going theory. The master will be here soon. So. You've returned to Tokyo. Hey you! Please, have a seat. - It's been a while. - Things sure change in five years. I've even started carrying this. - Is that real? - 18 karat. - You don't look well. - That's me. Have you been sleeping well? You seem to be worried. Oh yeah, Tatara came by. That's a good man! - Your wife is well? - She's taken the kids to Ueno. - Do you have one child? - No. - Two? - No. - More than that? How about three? - Yes. There are three. With how many more to come. Hello! - We've come for our ball. - Go ahead. You once taught... a Mizushima Kangetsu. Does he come here often? You have business with him? What's he like? - What's going on? - Their ball flew over here. They sure are noisy. Can't even read. If I were education minister, I'd close that school. You seem irritated. Nothing but irritation all day. - Can we get our ball? - Go a h ead. Another ball! - That's the 16th time today. - That's terrible. - Gives me stomach pain. - Shouldn't allow it. - I agreed if they came to the door. - You should move! Move? I'd never do that. If stubbornness affects your... study, nerves, and health, give in. You can't win. Stupidity. I'll fight to the end! People with edges break bones when they fall. Round ones can roll anywhere. Nothing happens as you want. There's nothing gained opposing... those with wealth. Hey. Suzuki, you are... So, you're working for Kaneda! I came for your own good. You really are his puppet. Take it how you will. Oooowww! I'm bleeding. This is too much. I heard from Sampei about you and Kaneda. - No shame if you give in. - Never to a money grubber! - Tell that to Kaneda! - But you... Get out! Get out of here you idiots! Now. Jump from there. Hurry up! Jump! Jump from there! Hurry up and jump! Why are you crying? Master, what's going on? Stay out of it! Now jump. Jump down! - What have the girls done? - Idiot! You won't jump? - They're pitiful. Please... - Shut up! No reason for you to cry. Now hurry and jump! What are doing to the children? They picked on the cat so... I told them to do what a cat can! Since that ball incident you've been strange. Things don't go your way, no need to take it out on the kids. It's cowardly. I went to your school. What's that? I was called by the principal. Something that fellow would do. Did he say I was fired? Did you know he would? I knew he'd do at least that. You're so hopeless. - Hopeless am I? - Yes. Going against him was the reason... he's given you to end of year. - How's that? - You don't understand anything. What's to become of me and the kids? Worried about that, he called me in. What a busybody. What did you tell him about us? I told him you were irritable because of your stomach pain. And begged him to forgive you. Don't talk about my stomach! He said he'd overlook it because... you're a valued English teacher. It's a special dispensation. How could he overlook it? Never heard of such a thing! - You. - What is it? It's your calling. Isn't the hard time over? I beg you. Please persevere. YOSHIDA TORA Z O - DETECTIVE The detective has brought the thief. The thief... caught by the detective. Such endeavor! I'm head of the house. I'm officer Yoshida. Please excuse me. - So this is... - The suspect. He's confessed and has been charged. Go on make your apologies. Bound as I am... forgive my improper stance. I've dishonored you in this matter, an inexcusable offence. Please allow me to make amends through serving my imprisonment. That's so commendable. Though he is a thief this is the most sincere thing I've ever heard. Are they usually like this? I can't speak for them all, but he is probably one of the best. By the way, please report by 9 in the morning at... Asakusa police station. - Report? - We'll return the recovered items. Don't forget to bring your seal. Abandoning hope of the prime ministership is the only way. - Why now? You oaf! - There's nothing else to be done. - I'll be going. - Please wait, Mr. Suzuki! Who made this decision? The leadership committee. So it's final. That's inexcusable! When examining your books irregularities were found. We know how you cheated so many poor people. Wouldn't have made money otherwise. And there were stock swindles. Your greed has outdone you. It's all in the records! He has given tons of money away! All to become prime minister. - If it's no good, give it back! - You must be joking. Mother. Don't demean yourself. The money he was given never went to the campaign. It's all in his own coffers. I won't answer such slurs. I thought I was a good hustler, but there was someone better. Never show your face here again! I couldn't possibly be seen... entering such a crooked house. I'm ashamed to have known a person like you. Get out! You'll be sorry! Just wait. No need to become a politician. Making money is enough. I'll become your support. Miss, you sure showed him up. Well done. You're fun. Miss. Would you buy a palanquin? A round one is good. I rode in one and was impressed. It will double in price. Is that right? Let's discuss it. Come to my room. No more tobacco. No more tea. Nothing left. Can't you do something? Sorry. I wanted to wash my hands. You surprised me, Uncle. I was surprised too. When did you arrive? I'll tell Mom. That's okay. I saw her already. Seeing the woman bathing the raven, falls in love. - W h at's t h at? - A poem by Takahama Kyoshi. Kyoshi must have seen a madonna too. Seen w h at? You're pretty. I never noticed before. O h my, out of now h ere. Th e cat's wit h you? Yeah, he cried on the train. W h at h appened? You h ardly ever come h ere. And so late. I went to the police station. The police? - And Auntie? - She's at home. I went to pick up the recovered things. It was only a box of yams. Uncle, does Auntie know you're here? I was hoping to stay here tonight. Did something happen? I grabbed him and left home. - You must be joking. - No, it's true. That's not good. When I came from the police I didn't want to go home. And came over here. - And school? - I skipped. - Did you fight with Auntie? - We fight all the time. - Then why did you leave home? - I got tired. - Do you plan to stay long? - That's not my plan. You aren't the only one tired. - Doesn't every one feel the same? - That's just it. If you know than you should just bear it. The truth is, when I saw your face in the bath, I wanted to go home. My face? But you see it all the time. But today I feel I saw it for the first time. That's it. I thought I saw things all the time. But I actually saw nothing at all. I can't go on like this. I should live like Blacky. Who is Blacky? This guy's friend. The rickshaw man's cat. Blacky got sprayed by a weasel. But destroying h is own nose on a rock was h is salvation. He is a brilliant cat! That is an interesting cat. He'd be happy to have a supporter like you. He'd never need something like that. You're going home tomorrow? Aren't you? Come along with me. Mistress! Mistress! - What is it? - Master has come home. Osan, where did you see him? Yukie too. Where did you come in? From the front. - Hello, Auntie. - Hello. Where were you last night? I worried you'd had an accident. You're horrid. I stayed at Yukie's. Well, you came just in time. My sister sent word that her water broke. With her husband away, I just have to go and help her. And you not coming home. I was in such a state. Go ahead, Auntie. I'll be here. Really? Thank you. I must get her to hospital. And I'll be back soon. We can talk then. I wonder why he went to your place. - He surprised me. - Did he say anything? No. Nothing special. I don't stay cooped up here because I like it. I even get fed up some times. - You do? - Of course I do. I've even run away. Really? Where did you go? I just walked around for 3 hours. Why is it that women must marry? It's alright if you don't. I must hurry. See you. Uncle. You got off with a scolding. So many books I haven't read. You must have worried and upset your stomach. My stomach? I'd forgotten about it. I remembered but the pain doesn't come back. This is great. I'm cured. When Meitei comes I'll have to brag. Are they coming today? I don't know. Kangetsu went home a few weeks back. What's happening with his betrothal? Seems he got bored of polishing glass balls. Knew he couldn't spend 20 years... Hey, Osan. Has there been a misfortune in the neighborhood? - Yes. At the harp teacher's. - Really? That old lady sure plucked on... but couldn't keep it up forever. It's not the teacher. Mi-ke's the one who died. The cat? It's a cat funeral? Mi-ke has received chants... and her posthumous name... so she can rest in peace. She's certainly been blessed. But it was just a bit cold. It was the fault of that stray. Yes, that beast is responsible. It isn't fair a sweet thing like... Mi-ke should die young and a... filthy stray keeps cavorting on. You're so right. There'll never be another cat like Mi-ke... Someone's at the door. The General has come on a horse. Show him upstairs. Dressed in funeral attire I couldn't welcome him. And if Mr. Kaneda should come? Turn him away at the door. We have no more need of him. The Kanedas are staying low. His wife aloof as ever. Makes us idiots to rush over here. I only dropped in for a visit. Their servant said the wife is unusually worried. It's only been one day. One day or 1,000 they are ruined. If ruined that would be that. Their house is now shunned by civilization. If progress continues like this, I'll get tired of living. - So go ahead and die. - You can't die while living. When civilization progresses, individuality becomes stronger Individuality makes marriage impossible. Our connections to each other get stretched so far, lately parents and children are living apart. If there's anything else that can separate it's husband and wife. They'd separate because of that? I'm worried. They'd separate. All of them. All couples will separate. Couples are like oil and water. Individually they work against each other, their home is shaken like an earthquake. Each eventually realizing the other is lost to them. My wife truly loves me so... I must disagree with the oil and water example. That's a relief. All this talk of separation discourages an unmarried person like me. Your cat looks dejected. His beloved... Mi-ke cat has died. Cats have no concept of the future, that's why their skulls are small. So they can't be sad about death. But look... he's saying he's sad. Excuse me. Oh, it's you Kangetsu! - Just back from your home? - Yes. You were away so long. - Please accept this. - A present? In celebration of the wedding. Dried bonito. Wedding? Oh, you've married! So this is... In the past no woman spoke back to her husband. That's like a kept woman. Big words from a bachelor. Kangetsu is here. When did you get back? Two days ago but I've been busy. Stopped polishing those balls? - What about a doctorate? - Doctorate? I no longer need a doctorate. Then what about the wedding? Wedding? Whose wedding? Yours, of course. Kangetsu already has a wife. Sorry I didn't tell you. When I was home my parents chose a wife for me. I thought it right to marry right away. That was decisive! Please introduce her. We came together but she's shy and went home. I saw her. She looked strong. What will you do about Kaneda? I won't do anything. But you're obliged... even though we were against it. It's not so bad. It'll be fine. Getting married is like bumping into someone in the dark. I can't listen to this. Sanpei is here. - Master, how's your stomach? - Completely cured. - You shouldn't always stay in. - I said I'm fine. Fishing's good. I rented a boat on Sunday. - Catch anything? - Not a one. Was it fun then? Great. You should all do it. Small boat out on the big sea. I'd rather a big boat on a small sea. I'd have to catch a whale or a mermaid. Can you catch those? Intellectuals have no sense. I'm not an intellectual. Is that right? What are you then? To us businessmen, common sense is all important. With my good sense I've... decided to only carry cigars. You can afford such things? Not now but will soon. Smoking these is a new experience. What you do is so much easier... than becoming a doctor. Right, Kangetsu? So you're Kangetsu? Because you're not a doctor... I've accepted. - A doctorate? - No. The Kanedas' daughter. I felt sorry for you but... the parents were so insistent, that I accepted. Don't worry about me. That's a relief. I brought along some beer. Please drink to my happiness. - Call mistress and Yukie. - Yukie has gone home. Take this to mistress. Yukie was here and you didn't tell us. So she went home... but she'll come again. Be sure to have a big wedding. Of course. You're all invited. I'll serve you champagne. - Master must come too. - I don't want to. My once-in-a-lifetime ceremony! - That's inconsiderate. - I still won't go. No formal clothes? I'll provide them. - No thanks. - You'll get better. I'm fine! - The cat could take his place. - Will cats drink champagne? The cat's not here. He was here a moment ago. You'll come, won't you? Yes, but as just a human. You all seem to have such fun together. To pass time, people exercise their mouths. And laugh at unhappy things. Unhappy and happy things are necessary I guess. It doesn't earn a penny... but you're good at it. I am a cat. I don't yet have a name. I don't know where I was born. I was born as a cat and have lived these two years with humans. I've not yet caught a rat and the maid scolds me for it. I don't know what my master sees in me. But still he lets me live here. I am deeply grateful. Sampei came earlier and teased the people here, but... my feelings are slightly different. Though they talk all the time... and seem so carefree, when you tap on the bottom of their hearts... from somewhere comes a sad sound. They know their talk has no effect upon the world. But in this age it is very precious. Finishing dinner, master's gone to his study. Mistress is sewing her everyday wear. The children line up their pillows and go to bed. The maid went to the bathhouse. Nothing is different from usual. The cups are half full. The humans drank this and became talkative. Sometimes even cats like to get high. I never thought Mi-ke would die so suddenly. She was indescribably beautiful. What a strange phenomenon. Suddenly I feel warm. My vision is blurring. I feel like singing "I'm a cat. I'm a cat." and dancing. I'm so sleepy... can't tell if I'm sleeping or walking. My stomach's so hot... I'll drink some water. When Master gets indigestion... it must feel like this. I wish he could be easy going like me and live long. The cat has... What is it? A novel? I never thought you'd be the one... to pick the cat up from the water pot. You were crying. I AM A CAT THE END
