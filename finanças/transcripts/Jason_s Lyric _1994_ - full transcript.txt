We went to the bayou. -The bayou? -Mmm-hmm. -Whatever. -[CHUCKLES] Well, uh... What you all do at the bayou? We walked and we talked. [INHALES] And he washed my feet. -What? Girl? -[LAUGHING] I'd just die for a nigger to wash these feet. Oh, yes, girl, I know. Mmm. And then he laid me down and he rubbed my head so gently. -Lyric? -Mmm? You didn't make love?

[SOBS] Jason, I am trying to love you. But I don't want my heart broken. And that's exactly what you're gonna do if you keep trying to save a brother that don't wanna be saved. What kind of hold does he have on you, huh? Why do you keep having these nightmares? You might as well just go ahead. My life is fucked up. It's been fucked up ever since... Since what? Since what? Since... When we was little, one night me and Josh was in the bed, we heard this real loud noise. So me and Josh got up to see what was going on. Daddy had come to the door. He was all drunk. And he was beating on Mama. No! Get out of here, boy! I tried, I wanted to stop it. And Josh went... And Josh went in and got Mama's gun. Mama screamed and she told him, "No, don't kill anybody." No, no, no. Josh. So I tried to take it from him. No, baby! Baby, no! Joshua, give me the gun! And I tried to take it from him. Daddy came rushing towards me. And before I could do anything, I just turned around. [GLORIA SCREAMING] [SOBBING] I didn't mean to shoot him. [SOBBING] I just want my daddy back. Oh, Jason, God. Oh, Jason, it's not your fault. It's not your fault. Listen to me. You just tried to be a hero. Just like you're doing right now. But sometimes, heroes have to walk away. Walk away, Jason. Or we can't be together. [SIGHS] GLORIA: That's the day he came home. There should have been a band and a job waiting for him. I guess it's easy to walk around with blinders on and not notice the sacrifice people are making for you. You don't owe Joshua and me nothing. You hear me? There are no debts in this house. Nobody killed Maddog. He died in that war. They just didn't bury him. I want you to go to her, baby. Be happy. [BLUES MUSIC PLAYS] Alonzo, man, why don't you just tell us who jumped your ass so we can take care of those busters? Bitch, I told you, I tripped. You tripped off what, man, Transco Tower?

Just forget it, girl, okay? You got every right to see that nigger if you want to. I just wish you'd get up, girl. You better stop moping around here and call him. I can't. It's like Jason never even happened. But you know it did. Oh, Miss Girl. I know that Alonzo's not perfect. But I'm gonna hold on to him because he's all I got. The Wards ain't full of Jasons. What you found... What you found was quiet in a world full of thunder. I ain't got no choice but to listen to it. You do. ALONZO: Yo, Marti, bring your fine ass down here, girl. Love calls. RAT: [KNOCKING ON DOOR] Jason! Come on, man! Joshua's gone crazy! MAN: Come on, man. RAT: Let's just go! Who knows what he's all gonna do. Come on, he's got a gun. Do you got any jimmies? No, but that's all right. That's all right. All right for who? All right for us. [SIGHS] Now why you had to go and do that? Damn! Don't start the fire unless you can hose me down. Baby, come on. Get off me! What? You gonna butter the biscuit when it pop out of the oven? -[LAUGHTER] -Biscuit? Ain't no biscuits, girl. I don't think so, okay. RAT: I hope he don't get to Alonzo before we do, man. He might kill him this time. [RON AND DARRYL TALKING INDISTINCTLY] ALONZO: We'll be back in three minutes. Alonzo, watch that other jaw.

You, you think he's better than me? You think he's better than me? Josh! Ah, I knew you'd come! You're always there to pick up the pieces. You seen them two niggers I got downstairs? Yeah, I seen them, man. I took care of that! All we gotta do now is wait for Alonzo. You ain't gotta go nowhere, man! You're right. You're right, Josh. I ain't gotta go nowhere. Just let her go. I can't let her go, Jay. We're gonna use her as bait. She ain't got nothing to do with this, Josh. We can take on Alonzo together, me and you. Why are you still talking about her? What is this? You fuckin' putting her above me? -You're putting her above me, man! -Josh, no, man. What about me, man? What about me? What about you? It's always been about you. I've spent my whole fuckin' life for you! Josh. I can't do that no more, man. Oh, I'm tired of you telling me I'm fucking up, man! Shit. Because I took care of this. Fuck you, man! What are you talking about, nigger? You fucked up! This shit is fucked up! I'm tired of your shit, Josh! I don't need this no more! I don't need you! I don't need you! I don't give a fuck about you, Josh! Don't make me do this again, nigger. Come on, Josh, let her go. Don't make me do this again, man. She taking you away from me, man! She taking you away from me!
