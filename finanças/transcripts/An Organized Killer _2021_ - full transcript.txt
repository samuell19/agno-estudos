Help me! Help! Help me! Please don't! Please! Don't, don't please! Poor Mia. They'll catch you. No, they won't. I am very good at cleaning up. To a fresh start. To a fresh start. Newly divorced, with a 17 year-old daughter and also new owner of this fine establishment and zero spare time. So I don't really know how fresh, but... Oh come on. You could have twin babies and a husband who only talks to you when he wants sex. Todd's a doctor. The doctor is Todd, and I'm like his Tesla, spit shined and Polish to show off to all his sophisticated doctor friends. I'd love a spit shine. Oh, you guys are so bad. Come on, being single has its perks. Yeah, like what? Like... That tight thing right there. Oh my, he's cute. What? We heard rumors you're dating the new guy. Oh yes, honey and they were nasty. He's 10 years younger than you. Eight. It's perfectly fine to date younger men. After dealing with James McGuire and his cheating butt for what, like 16 years? You deserve it. Plus, a bartender's perfect rebound material. He's not a rebound. Really? I need my best manager back at work as soon as you're off maternity leave. Todd doesn't think I need to work anymore. He's gonna stop you? No, he isn't. Gracie! He's not coming here. Yeah, we have a meeting. What happened to that new young thing he was dating? Well they split and he told me he started AA last week and that he's turned over a new leaf. They all sell that line just to get you back, and then a few months later, go right back to cheating. Yeah, well I'm not buying, I mean we're divorced and I'm good with that, so. Look I just need a few minutes to talk to him. Black coffee, I'll be over here. Sure. Hello ladies. Hello James. They okay? Yeah, it's ladies night. Oh, right, sorry. Final reconciliation from our retirement account. Your half has been wired and the keys to the investment property. My new home, thanks. We should have sold it. Well, I want it to be close to you for Charlie's sake James. So maybe we can at least try and be civil neighbors. This place is going to suck you dry, you're taking on too much, I could help. I used to own the place, I mean, I know the game. Okay, my plan is self-reliance James. And to make an honest living. What is that supposed to mean? Oh come on, you ran a cash bar for years. Who knows how much you skimmed off this place. And to think I assumed you were handling it correctly. The judge awarded me the restaurant, so first things first, I'm putting things together financially and I'm giving it an upgrade. You're changing my bar? Yeah, it's my restaurant now. Coffee. He's the upgrade. That's okay Alex. How long has it been? Five days since my last drink. Are you feeling okay? No, I feel horrible. Um, where's our daughter? She's at home. She's spending the night at Vanessa's. School night? It's summer break, James. Hey, mother of the year. Okay, well yeah, only second to you. Maybe I'll stay for dinner. How's the snapper. Fresh out. Go home James, this is no longer a good place for you. Yeah. I'll see you neighbor. The jerk's gone. It's not fair. Is he still playing the innocent card? Yeah, yeah, he claims it never happened. Some dudes just never come clean. Grace, are you all right? Yeah, I'm okay. Anytime you need me I'm there. He's cute, and heroic. To being a sugar momma. How about a nightcap? I would love that but my place is a mess, there's boxes everywhere. As soon as I get organized, I will take you up on that offer. Sounds amazing. Good night. I'll see you tomorrow. Charlie! I'm home. Charlie. Charlie? Charlie? Hey, rate it one out of ten. - One out of ten. - Ohhhh! A four! Hi Ms. Mcguire. Hi. Okay, that one was better than a one. Charlie. Hi mom. Oh, hi Mrs. Mcguire. Bailey. She's divorced now. Hi Vanessa, don't worry about it. Hey the kitchen's kind of a mess. Sorry we were hungry. Okay well what time are you going to Vanessa's? Uh, about 30 minutes. All right, make sure you clean up the mess. Thank you. - Bye. - Bye. Thank you. Don't drop it in the water. Bye Ms. Mcguire. - Bye. - Bye. Hi, you've reached Kristin, you know the routine. Hey neighbor. So, Charlie's going to a sleepover tonight and I was thinking I would open a really good bottle of red. I will leave the front door unlocked if you want to come over. All right, let me know, bye. Friends, yeah right. Help! Kristin! Kristin! Kristin, Kristin, oh my god. Grace what is going on? Somebody attacked me. Oh my god. Okay, okay, come in, come in. Jeez Louise. Yeah. We checked the property and the house and they're clear. We found this in your sauna. Thank you. You might wanna check if anything else is missing before I finish the report. Yeah, I will. Grace. - Hey. - Hi. Are you okay? Yeah I'm fine, I'm just rattled. Where's Charlie? She's at a sleepover. I don't wanna tell her, I don't wanna get her scared. Yeah, we thought it best. Yeah, good idea. Have you found any prints, anything? No. What about video? I don't have a security system. Its James, did she tell you about her ex husband? Yeah, he was at home, but he doesn't have an alibi. We're keeping a close eye on him for sure. Look, this is a big home on a large piece of property, its a perfect opportunity for someone looking to make a quick score. You know what I suggest, you get that security system or a large dog. No dogs, I just got the hoa to handle the barking dog on the other side of me. Kristin. Grace is your friend. What? I like to sleep in. Whatever, you know what, or a roommate. You have like ten bedrooms. I don't care if she's got ten bedrooms. She's by herself. Ladies, any of those options are a great way to deter crime. Thank you, yeah I'll call a security company in the morning. You bet. Please, give us a call if anything else comes up? Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. - Goodnight. - Goodnight. A camera won't stop someone from getting in and hurting you, they'll just wear a mask, you should really consider a roommate. No, I completely disagree. She's by herself Kristin. She shouldn't have to go through this. Oh, it's Alex. - Go. - Go ahead. Hey. Grace, are you all right? I just got your message. Yeah, I'm fine. I can come over and help. That's really sweet of you but Jaclyn and Kristin are here. Grace I'm worried about you, it's dangerous to be living alone. Yeah, I might consider renting out a room. All right, well how much? I'll move in tomorrow. I'll see you at work. You can call me for anything, anytime. I care for you. Thank you, bye. Do you guys wanna come in? Yeah, yeah, we will. I don't really wanna be alone. That's fine. We're not leaving you alone tonight. Okay. Come on, let's go. Charlie, time to get up. Come on honey, we have stuff to do. We've had the intercom for two weeks. I'm going to revoke your license to use it. It's Sunday. Sunday funday. You want scrambled or sunny side? There's tots or hash browns, bacon or sausage. Coffee. Your date with Alex must have been swell. It was, why? You're very chipper. Am I? I hadn't noticed. Its weird mom, he is not much older than me. He's 10 years older. And besides I'm not a grandma, nor is he a kid. I didn't say it like that. It's just you haven't been divorced very long. You want some cream? Black. Since when? Since I grew up. Okay, you are still in high school. So you're still mine. Grumpy. I need you to finish unpacking those boxes this morning. I'm still not sure about living here. What do you mean? I liked it with dad? Look things change, honey. I've changed, I can help you for a couple hours this morning. I can't, Vanessa and I already made plans to go on the boat with dad. Yeah, after you finish unpacking and clean up the mess that you made in the bathroom. Mom, I'm not going to cancel on dad. He is all alone and I'd like to see him. Right, okay, well you should see him. Tell him hi for me. Thank you, I will. Oh, I almost forgot, I'm meeting a few potential roommates at luxe this afternoon. Also really weird, mom. Okay, well, weird. Guess I'm weird. ♪ I'm counting down the hours ♪ ♪ cause you and I ♪ ♪ my list is long and slower ♪ ♪ so don't hold too tight ♪ ♪ trying to figure out what I want ♪ ♪ but you won't ♪ ♪ cause I'm the one who's holding the gun ♪ ♪ the gun ♪ ♪ I'm no good at playing ♪ Hey dad, we're out of ice. Okay, I'll hit the dock. How's your mother? A mess. She hasn't unpacked anything and is having a midlife crisis daily. She really dating that bartender? Alex? Yeah. She's hooked on that one. Charlie, come DJ. I can never pick a song. Upgrade. Any luck? Hey, no, they're all duds. Jaclyn's sending one more to meet me now but I mean, honestly, if I'm gonna rent out a room I just want somebody I can talk to. Agreed. Oh, Kristin. Hey. Hey, can you come over right now? Oh, I can't, I’m stuck, I have meetings. Can we rain check? That's what you said last time. Yeah I know, I'm sorry. Next time, I promise. Sure. Hey look, why don't we make some time this weekend? I'd like to, but I told Tommy I’d spend it with him. Okay, well have fun, we'll do next week. Okay, sounds good, I'll see you next week. Okay, bye. Can I get a menu, please? Here. Oh wait, I actually know what I want. A dirty Martini, ice-cold, like my heart. You need anything babe? No, I'm good, thanks. Okay. That was funny. You know, ice-cold like my heart. Keeps the wolves at bay. Yeah. Lilith Jones. Oh, uh, grace mcguire. Oh, I mean Bailey. You don't know your own last name? No, I'm just recently divorced. Well then, here's to happiness. Yeah, that's a much better way of looking at it. Can I buy you a drink? Well it's actually my restaurant. Oh, well then drinks on you? Yeah, yeah, I've been working all day, I will have a drink with you. Alex? You have the most beautiful restaurant on the lake. Aw, thank you, we're undergoing a remodel soon. That'll cost a few nickles. Oh, thank you. Yeah well, you know, I got it in the divorce along with enough cash to turn this moose lodge around, so. Moose lodge? Yeah, I mean that's all it ever really was. At least for my ex husband and his band of brothers to drink so. Here's to turning it into a profitable establishment. Sounds like you're in the middle of a little facelift. Well you know, the restaurant, not me. Well I think with a little attention to detail, this place could be the new hot spot. Oh? You have a suggestion? I might. It's my friend Jaclyn, she keeps sending me these no-shows for this room I'm renting. Allow me. Jaclyn, hi it's Lilith. Girl you move fast. I know. She is everything you said she would be. I think you guys would make great roommates. Yes, we will be good. Okay, good luck. Okay, loves, talk soon. I'm sorry for the ruse but I have had a few inferior roommates. I wanted to make sure that you were compelling. Well there's no sincerity like a woman telling a lie. Touche. It's Alfred Munson from the movie indiscreet. Movie buff? I... the classics, really. You? No, no, it's not me. Uh huh, okay see now that I believe. Well if I haven't completely blown my chances, I would really love to see the room. Yeah, perhaps tomorrow morning? Look I'm currently between homes, staying in a hotel, is there any chance we could see it tonight? I would really, really appreciate it. Sure, yeah, its just around the corner. Thank you. Just give me a second to deal with something in the kitchen. Yeah. Hey babe, actually I think this girl may be good, I'm gonna go take her home and see if she... Okay, what do you wanna do about dessert? Did you want to do strawberries, or do you want to do blueberries? Grace Rose mcguire, still haven't changed your license. Have you watched the YouTube video that we watched? Yeah, sure. - It's... - Yeah. Well actually, oh you know, I can figure it out. Sure, sure. You have lots of experience. Just trust your gut. Sorry about that. Uh, shall we? Yeah. It's really close, you want to take one car, two? One car. So how do you know Jaclyn? I'm redesigning their baby room. Oh, are you and interior designer? I specialize in organization. Life management, the removal of unwanted aspects from ones life. I just started reading Marie Kondo. Spark joy! Exactly. Wow, old movies, reading self-help books, gonna have to stay on my toes. No, just pay the rent on time. And this will be your room, once I get all of my stuff out of here. Would it be possible to rent this furniture? I don't have much. I'm starting to think there's more to the story. Bad relationship, had to get out quickly and I'm just now starting over. Yeah, I understand. Mom, I'm home! That's my daughter, Charlie. May I use your loo? Yeah, the guest bathrooms right there. Great. No, the answer is no. It's only a week. It's the week before school starts, there is so much to do then. It's Barbados, and he said I could bring Vanessa. No. I can come back. No, oh, sorry, Charlie, this is, uh... Lilith. - Hi. - Hi. Hey, if you go to Barbados you have to try the cove, it is the best club at St. Lawrence gap. That's near where we're staying. No, no clubs, no Barbados. Mom, please. Please! Oh my gosh, I will call your father in the morning, maybe he'll move the dates. Fine. I'm sorry. It's okay. No it's not, you know James did this on purpose. He knows it's the week before school starts, he just loves playing games. So stop playing. Easier said than done. Look, I have a friend who's a mediator for divorced couples, you communicate only through her, never directly towards James, she'll make sure the games end. Hmm, I like that. Look, the offer on the room still stands. I'm intrigued, but the rent, it's a little more than I can afford. How about this, you help me get unpacked and organized and I can knock of 20 percent for the first three months? It'll give you sometime to get grounded. Wow, that is so generous. Would you like to see my references? Oh no, any friend of Jaclyn's is welcome in my home. Okay, deal. Is tomorrow too soon? Uh, no. Well that's the last of it. I didn't realize I had so much stuff. Who's your mom talking to? Alex, she's hired him for the restaurant remodel. And he has the qualifications? He has her eye. Love, it's a funny thing. I wouldn't know, my parents barely let me out of the house, let alone date. Well don't rush. Its dangerous. Hey, where's your inhaler? Bathroom. -I'll be back. Yeah, I'll be in later, I want to go over the inside seating area. Yeah, no babe, I want to pick the color. Yeah, it's important to get it right. You know, wrong color, people don't wanna eat. No, I mean, it shouldn't be long, just... Where's your inhaler? Bathroom. Where is it? Bathroom. It's not there. It's not here. It's not here. Uh, in the clothes? I can't find it. You're okay, you're okay, you're okay, come on. Come here, ready? Deep breath. One more, one more, one more. I'm okay. Oh, that was scary. I almost died while you were out on the phone with Alex. Honey it was work. Really mom? Is Alex work or play? You haven't even been divorced for five minutes. Charlie, I... Hey, she's upset because you canceled that trip with her dad. Yeah but I cave every single time, I have to stand my ground. Oh god I'm shaking. Hey, hey, hey, it's okay. It's okay. It's okay. Oh, I love this color. This one's better, you would be surprised how the color burgundy makes one hungry. Burgundy, I don't know, it's just so dark. Hey. Hey. Thanks for giving me a job while you're closed. Yeah, well I needed somebody to take down all the old signage and be the go-between with the difficult vendor. Okay. Thank you. Can I get you guys anything? Coffee, cappuccino? Yes, coffee please. Um soy... Soy milk with two sugars? Yeah. Lilith? Black, please. All right. It's great that you found someone so nice. Yeah, he's a good guy. Seems to be. Not my type, but. Really? I like women. Oh, I, I didn't realize. My last relationship grew a little unhealthy. She started to abuse me. A narcissist would be putting it lightly. So I ran. I'm really grateful for your help. Yeah well, we're all a little bit broken, right? Yes we are. And these drawings are wonderful. Is there anyway you can draft them onto the computer so I can get a bid on materials? Yes, I am currently without a laptop though. I actually have one, an extra. I mean I basically only use it to shop online, so it's probably better to have it out of sight anyways. Charbear is the password. Cute. Here, I'm gonna give you these, see if you can scan... Excuse me. Excuse me! Please be careful it's really important we don't have any costly accidents. Really mom? Get a room? She was watching it. Her window faces the kitchen, how much watching can she actually do? Look I don't like her, okay, she is not one of us. What is that supposed to mean? It means she's some stranger off of the street. Look you're opening the doors of our community to trouble. Okay Kristin, you're over reacting. I mean honestly, I like having a roommate. Maybe you should try it. You know, I am happy with my lifestyle and you should be to. Okay look we can just agree to disagree, I gotta go. Fine, I'll talk to you later. Hello? Alex? Hey. Hey, I just left the market, I was picking up the new table cloths. Did you give somebody the key to luxe? No, of course not. Somebody's here. Hello grace. Hey, what are you doing? Hello? I thought I'd make myself something to eat while I waited for you. But obviously that was too great of a pleasure for the universe to allow me. How did you get...? You made a copy of the key? I have copies grace, I used to own this place, what did you do with my signage? Some of that had value. This is no longer your place James. If you want something, you call the mediator. I don't want to call a mediator. I want to call you. Well that is the only choice I'm giving you right now. What happened Gracie? What happened between us? Have you been drinking? No. God, no. I am still sober but it has not been easy. I need somebody to talk to. Then call you sponsor James. I can't do this for you anymore. I never cheated. Go home James. Please, just listen to me. I've heard enough. You called the cops? No. Damn it grace. Let go of me. She just called and asked if I had given anyone else the key, I told her no and then she hung up. Anything else you remember? She seemed concerned so I hurried over. He's promised not to come back. Thank you. Are you sure you don't want to press charges? Yeah, yeah he's upset, just let him walk it off. Okay, be careful. Yeah. Ma'am, please do not hesitate to call. Grace, are you all right? Yeah, why did you call the police? He just wanted to talk. No, I didn't. We were on the phone. I thought the call dropped, I was worried, I didn't call anyone. Oh. The paint contractor is gonna be here. Hello, detective? Thanks for checking the restaurant. Okay, will do. Wow, that's a good shot. I'm sorry, did you say something? Did you take that? Yeah. It's really good. It's my mainly Vanessa, she's so hot, it's hard to mess up a photo of her. Oh come on, give yourself a little credit. Look, the lighting, the composition tells me you know a thing or two. Thank you, my plan's to go to calarts after high school. What? I heard it's really hard to get in. Not really, they don't even look at your grades, it's mainly about your portfolio. Do you have one? I'm working on it. Ooh, can I see? Sure. You'd be the first person to see it besides Vanessa, so. What, not your parents? No, they're too caught up in their own drama. Okay wait, that. I love that. That ones my favorite. You're 16 Charlie, decide what you want to be and your parents will learn to live with it. I'm not even sure what I want. And that's okay. You think so? Yes. Thank you, I think you're the only person who gets me. Good work. Hello. Hi, I'm Lilith. Yes, I know. You've been keeping grace so busy lately, I barely see her anymore. I think grace decides what to do with her time an who to hang out with. As if you know anything. I know she doesn't have time for drunk spinsters who never grew up. How dare you? You still living off daddy's money? Better than no good street trash looking for a free ride. I've called the home owners association, she's not supposed to be renting out rooms. Especially to people like you. It's against the rules. I thought you were her friend? I'm saving her for her own good. Don't make waves, you might not like where they take you. These reviews, they're endless, listen to this one. Robert says "would be a great place to hang "if every other bar burned to the ground." "Happy hour, more like crappy hour." This isn't funny. Oh come on, we gotta laugh at something. I mean look, we're rebranding and Lilith has a friend that does social marketing, so. And she's amazing. Alex there is a delivery for you in the back. Sure. Excuse me. Of course. What do we think about the sign, it's a little work in progress. What? Oh nothing, we have a slew of bad reviews. Hey, did you take four bottles of that chardonnay that we were testing by chance? No, of course not. We're missing four bottles. Oh can't it just be one problem at a time? Lilith the sign is a really good start but we have to focus on PR. I will go home and grab your laptop and get to work. Thank you. Oh hey, can you grab Charlie on the way, she's at Vanessa's. Of course. Great, okay, let's do the inventory, discover what else is missing. Thank you, for picking me up. Of course. You know I never had any siblings. Me either. So sisters it is? Yeah sure. I'm gonna get the mail. Oh wait... I got your bag. Thank you. Hey, what are you doing tonight? Nothing, do you maybe wanna order some pizza and watch a movie? Yes. You pick the movie. And I'll order the pizza. Violation of subletting, renter must vacate. So okay, what else was it? Let's see, it was two bottles of whiskey, and one bottle of vodka. I wonder who it could be? Grace. Hey. What's wrong? Somebody stole some booze. But you've been closed. Yeah, exactly, so it's either James, or I don't know. I'm gonna pull the car up so we can get to dinner. Okay. You two are such a sweet couple. You're drunk. I found this quaint spot. Uh huh. Mia's wine cupboard. You went to Mia's? Nice grape juice... But it does the trick. Yeah. Where's Kristin? She didn't wanna come out. Why? She has an issue with your roommate. I know, I think she's being nosy. She likes her group and her group is all she likes, no outsiders. Come on, really? Well okay, I'm caught in the middle and don't like it. Lilith is good people. Well a few of her references were sketchy. What do you mean? A few of them didn't check out. You called them, right? No, you referred her, I thought she was in the group. Oh no, she's not in. She just redid my baby room, that's it, that doesn't mean I trust her. Seriously Jaclyn, she's living in my house. Girl you always check your references. I don't know, she's been a really big help. She got my life back on track. Yeah, so what's to worry about then, right? I lied on my resume when I was young. Oh stop. Oh you didn't. No, I never. Yes? I sent the letter to grace. Well if she isn't gone by this weekend, you get the police over here. Maybe it would help if you just talked to her. - No. - Come on. No, nobody can know that it was me calling. Grace wouldn't understand. Hey can I come by later? Not tonight Tommy. Please. I'm not in the mood. Okay. We'll reschedule for next week, okay? Okay, but I want to see you. Thank you. Bye. What the hell? Nice try Kristin. I like it here. Get out of my house. I'm calling the police. Oh, smells great in here. Vegan bacon, egg whites, and sour dough toast. What's on today's agenda? You're days pretty packed, first I have you meeting with a new hostess who I think you will love and then you're scheduled to meet the liquor license inspector. Have you guys seen my bag? It's over there. Thank you, I’m going to Vanessa's. Where's the rest of your outfit? We're hanging out at the pool. That's Vanessa. What's in your bag? Nothing. Open it. Really Charlie? Mom, I don't know where that came from. They came from the restaurant. I've never seen that before I swear, mom. You are not going anywhere. - Mom! - You're grounded! Give me your phone. Not fair! I'll go check on her. Hey, it's me. You okay? I didn't take those wine bottles. Even if you did, I think your mom is just really stressed about a lot of things. Luxe, feelings for your dad. What do you mean feelings for my dad? She left him. He cheated. What about Alex? Rebound? Look I think that is the root of a very unhealthy relationship. Perhaps the two of us could make her see that. She never listens. It's not about listening. It's about making her understand what's best for us. Should we go get some ice cream? Okay. Thank you. It's gonna be okay. Hey, our reservation's at 11. I know, I know, I’m sorry, I can't go. I meant to call you. I'm totally swamped. Okay, we can reschedule for tomorrow? No, Alex, look I really need to spend more time with Charlie, I'm sorry. I was kind of hoping maybe you could handle things at the restaurant for me just for a couple of days. Sure. I gotta go, thank you. Bye. Charlie? Hello? Hey, I got a text saying I should call you directly. Yeah, we need to talk about Charlie. What's up, is she okay? No, she's been seeking booze. Ugh, I'm afraid I've never been a very good example. You want me to talk to her? I'd be happy to talk to her. Really? I want our daughter to make good choices. Hey grace? Could we meet and just talk? Yeah. Thank you. Thanks again. Bye. It's a beautiful day. Yeah, it is. Can I ask you something? Sure. How would you like a full-time job? Oh well I sort of like my freedom, but what did you have in mind? I need a personal assistant. I mean, I really want to spend a little more time with Charlie. I can pay you really well. I would be honored. Thank you. Now you get in. What? You're crazy. No, I'm fun. As your new assistant, we will be taking more time out of the day for fun. Because without fun life is such a bore. Good morning. Morning. How would you like to go shopping today? Really? I thought I was grounded indefinitely. Really? Did I say that? Yeah, you did. Hmm. Well, I unsay it. Let's just relax today. What do you say? Sure, sounds like fun. I'll be right back. Hi, sorry to bother you. Hello. Hi. We'd like to have a word with you regarding your neighbor Kristin Carter. What's going on? We have some bad news. Kristin was found murdered in her home this morning. Oh my god. I'm sorry. Oh my god. We noticed you had a camera pointing in the direction of her home. May we take a look at the footage? Yeah, I can email you. Great, here's my email address. Thank you. We're so sorry for your loss. Our condolences. Thank you. Hey what's going on? Mom, are you okay? No. It's okay mom, tell me what happened. Mom, what's wrong? No, no, no. Mom, mom it's okay, it's okay. I spoke to Jaclyn. Kristin's father is taking her body back to Houston and they're having a service next week. I assume you're going. Yeah. You know I checked the security system and the cameras were turned off. Really? Yeah it was Charlie's code. Hey, what was my code? Have you been turning the cameras on and off? No, why would I? I am sure it's just a misunderstanding. I get confused with those things all the time. Yeah, maybe. Can I invite Vanessa over? Yeah, yeah sure. Thank you. Oh, that's Alex. Hey. Hi. Are you all right? Yeah, I'm better now that you're here. Hello Alex. Hello Lilith. Another glass of wine? Thank you. Wine? I'll have a beer. I got it. Thank you. You did that a little too expertly. It's a bottle cap mom. To friends who have gone on. Cheers. It's so good. Well Charlie, I'd say we did a bang up job. Maybe a little over-salted, but we will get it perfect next time, right? Right. What do you think, mom? Mmmm. I think it's delicious. Charlie it's very good. What happened to Vanessa? She couldn't come, Dylan's having a party tonight and I was wondering if I could meet up with them later? I don't know if that's... I'm not feeling very good. How about the two of you go relax. I'll help clean up. Thank you. Whoa, whoa. Okay, okay. Are you sure that it's okay? Yeah, she said it's totally fine. Have fun at the party. Thank you. No, thank you. Let's go. Hey, what's wrong? I don't think I should go. Why not, it's Dylan, he throws the best parties. I know, it's just my mom, she lost a good friend and as much as I hate her boyfriend I should be here for her. Hey, look if you don't wanna go, then I'm not gonna go. Really? Yeah, I was only going to spend time with you anyway. We can have a horror movie night part two? Do you have popcorn? Yeah. I'm in, let's go. Let's make popcorn first. Okay. You didn't even talk to me. You don't know what you're doing. Uh, who's that? My mom's boyfriend. So now I need your permission? You did that, not me. Look. I'm gonna go check on her. Perfect. I'm leaving, good night. When you're mom wakes up, tell her I'm sorry. What is going on? Your mom just had a little too much to drink. It looked like you guys were fighting. That's because he was trying to take advantage of her and I stopped him. Is my mom okay? Yeah she is, but we should get her inside. Okay, we can help. Mom. Mom are you okay? Come on, let's get you inside. Hey. Did you do it? No. You were passed out I was just going to bring you inside and that's when Lilith came out and, maybe she thought it was something more, but I think she's playing a game. Why would she lie? I can't say. But I promise I didn't do anything. James? What are you doing here? - What is he doing here? - Hey. She asked me here. Hey, hey what is it? Charlie told me what this punk did. Okay look, he didn't do anything. I believe it was a misunderstanding. Thank you. What about the text you sent me? You said you were still in love with me. What? No, I didn't text you last night. Okay, sure you have to put an act on in front of him, I get it. But we have years together and a daughter, that has to mean something. Okay James, I'm sorry but I didn't send you anything. All right, you need to go. Or what? Just go, she's over you. No, no, no. Stop it, stop it! Stop! Oh. Did she send me this? Huh? No, I didn't send that. I didn't send that! Maybe you were too drunk to remember. Either way, I thought it meant something. Looks like I was wrong. Are you okay? Fine. The only who has access to my phone is Lilith. Honey, you got drunk and made a mistake. And then why would she do that? You guys are like two peas in a pod. I don't know, but you know I check the security cameras to see if what she said about Alex was true, and they were turned off again. By who? I don't know, I mean it's my code but. Yeah, but who has that? Well it's the same as my phone. So Lilith? Why did you give her your pass code? She's my personal assistant. Right. You said some of her references didn't check out right? Do you still have that list? Yeah, I'll find it. Okay. So what's the plan with your birthday? Oh I don't know, I think I'm just gonna stay home. James actually called and wanted to talk. Whoa, yeah I get it. Hey. Hey, what's up? Hey baby. Do we still have that list of references Lilith gave us? I think it's in the office, you know the drawer I shove everything into. Yes, I know that drawer. Yeah, her name is Lilith Jones. Come on, I know it's there. Oh, I think I got it. You found it? Great, send me a photo of the paper please. Thank you. Hey what are you doing now, you wanna come hang out at the pool? Oh yeah, I'd love that. And it's hot. I know. There you are. Hey are you all right? Did I ever mention to you that I was an orphan? No. Yeah. I've never known my real mother. Father. As a kid, I was shuffled around from foster home to foster home until I was finally placed with this couple who had a son about my age. They couldn't have anymore kids so they adopted me. And my senior year of high school I lost them to a drunk driver. Rather than be split up my brother and I ran away. Where is he now? We fell in love. One day I woke up and he was gone. That was the end of my family, the end of my trust in men. Lilith I am so sorry. Hey. Uh... oh. Thank you. For what? Letting me be apart of your family. You're welcome. Goodnight. Goodnight. Todd, I'm on a call. Hi, sorry, did you get the photo I sent you? I did. You did? - Yes. - Great. But the photo you sent is not Lilith Jones. What do you mean it's not Lilith? It's not the same person. Hold on. Go ahead. It's not the same person. It sounds like someone has stolen Lilith's identity. Lilith Jones has blonde hair and blue eyes. Are you sure? Positive. Well okay. Well I appreciate you finally calling me back. It's none of my business, but identity theft is a felony, maybe you should call the police. Yeah, I will. Thank you. Grace? She's asleep, was there something I can help you with? Lilith? Hello Jaclyn. I need to talk with grace. I really wish you hadn't made that call. I liked you. How'd you know? It's amazing the things you can learn when no one knows you're watching. Wait, did you plant cameras in our house? Call me a lawyer. No you're sick, and I'm calling the police. Ah, good morning. Awwwww. Happy birthday. Thank you. Now, are you ready for your birthday festivities? Because I have a whole day planned. Oh babe, I was kinda hoping to just lay low. Oh we will at the spa. - Happy birthday, mom. - Ohhhh! Are you ready for dinner tonight? Oh please keep it small. So only 200 people? Got it. Very funny. - Love you. - I love you too. Hey have you seen Lilith? No. I can't find my phone, I think she might have it. Phones? Where we're going we don't need phones. I'm gonna go change. Lilith's throwing her a surprise party at the restaurant. Sounds like fun but my parents want me to go somewhere with them. So maybe we hang out later? Sure, let's do it. Cool, I'll call you. Okay, bye. Hey, how's the party, everyone here? Yeah sure, I need you to make a call. Sure, to who? Your dad, I think he should be here. I'm not doing that. I didn't ask for your opinion. Hello. Dad, mom wants you to come by the house before the surprise party. Are you sure? Yes, please. Okay Charlie, I'll see you there. Bye. Bye sweetheart. Good girl. Why are you doing this? It's a little game I like to play. Destroying happy families. You are so beautiful when you cry. Don't try anything smart. Wait, wait. What are you doing? I'm cleaning up. I guess we do this the hard way. Please don't do this. Go. So relaxing. And you sneaking into my dressing room. I didn't know you were so full of surprises. I have a few more tricks up my sleeve. Move. Get in the sauna. Get in. Stop, Lilith, please, please. Let me out, let me out! Mom! Mom! Hello. Look, I'm trying to work things out with my wife. If you have plans on getting in the way, it's best you move on. No sir, I have no intention of getting involved in that. I do have other plans. Give me your cellphone. Give me your phone. Hello. Mom. Charlie? Please help me. Please. If you call the cops she'll hurt Charlie, please hurry. Mom, please come quick. That's the sauna, drive, drive, drive. All right, all right, all right. Get out. No, no, no. Get out! It's okay. One day, when you mess up and you look over your shoulder, I will be there to make you pay. I'll be waiting. Dad! No. Mom! That's far enough. What do you want? The game is over. You need to get Charlie out of the sauna. Shut up. You want money, is that what you want? I have money, whatever, whatever you want. Just, just let Charlie and James go. I don't want your money, grace. Then what? I want him. I am sorry grace. I almost believed that you loved her. Oh I bet you loved that, didn't you? What is this? You were so pathetic, barely out of a toxic relationship with this prick and you jump right into bed with my brother. Oh yeah, that little story I told you, it was true. Even part about him leaving me. But then I tracked him down and it was such a rush to win him back from his new lover. What? So now we play our little game and it is quite a rush. Mom! Mom! How far do you think you're gonna get before we tell this story to the cops? Well pretty far considering the cops will never be looking for us. Tomorrow Alex will find the three of you in what looks like a really sad murder suicide. He will testify that you were crazy and no one will ever be the wiser. I get to shoot him. I think she dies first. No one dies! Mom! I really hated that burgundy paint. Call the cops! I'm on it. Get her inhaler, I'll call 911. Oh my baby. Oh please live. Baby, come on baby, come on. Charlie, Charlie. The cops are on their way. Come on, come on. Come on, come on. Come on, come on, come on, come on, come on. Come on baby, come on baby. No, no, no, no, no, no. Come on, come on. You're okay, you're okay. What you got? All clear here, clear in the back. My men searched everywhere. Both of them are gone. We're gonna catch them, don't worry but your friend, Jaclyn, she was brutally attacked as well. - No, no, no, no, no, no, no. - Shhhh. Hold me, I got you. I have a head injury, I'm not deaf. Jaclyn. Hi. It's so good to see you. Hey, hi. Hi. Glad you guys are well. Oh I'm so happy to see you. Thank you guys for coming. Of course. Yay. Well you guys, what are we waiting for? Let's get this party started. Yeah, go in, go in. Hey, you okay? I'm good, really good. Six months. Felt like six years. I'm so proud of you. Proud of you. Cause I'm opening a restaurant? Yes you are. Well, it was the split second decision, you never really know how you'll react in a situation like that until you're there. And the little boy was okay? Oh, not a scratch on him. I saved his life and I'd do it again. And again, and again. What are you doing later? Sounds like I'll be with you. So where on park Avenue do you live? The Upper East Side. - Oh, you're kidding. - No. I just got a job at a wine bar up there. Neat, really? Yeah, bar tender, yeah.
