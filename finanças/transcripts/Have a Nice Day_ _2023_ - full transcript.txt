How old is Angélica? - Eighty, right? - Are you sure? No, no. - Don't be an idiot. - I don't know anything. - Younger than you. - Yes? - Three, four years, at most. - Yes. She's still beautiful, though, eh? BARBERSHOP - Isn't she? - She's chubby. Is she chubby? Damn. - Well, she's... - Good night. - See you tomorrow, sir. - See you, Ángelo. See you tomorrow. - Have a nice time. - Take care, Angelo. Yes. Don't drink too much. See you. I dreamt about Gonini. I remember a lot of... of him because of... - Shit. - What happened? - I didn't hear you. - We ran out of Bacardi, brother. You know, my dad used to make us wear fucking mining boots. The ones with the studs. And now, the fashion is to wear a suit and tennis shoes. When I was young, tennis shoes were only for the poor. - This is yours. - Let's see. Mm, that's strong. Just drink it. It'll put you in a good mood. - Ready, guys. - I'm getting scolded? Salud. - Salud. - Salud. Oh, Marito. Have you showered this week? I can smell you from here. Your pits stink. Ah, you're right. I smell like Enrique when he made that one bet with La Bomba. What bet was that? To see who could stop bathing for the longest. And who was it that won? Enrique. Come on. How could La Bomba really not shower? She would have to get clean at some point. She traveled. How much time did Quique go without a shower? One full month. One month? Come on. I can't even do it for eight days. Well, that's why you never have any luck with women. What are you saying? The other morning, I got coffee with Rosita. - No. - Uh-huh. So tell me how it went. It was awful. I ended up in the hospital because I got tachycardia. Wait. One month without a shower? No, I don't buy that. What did La Bomba say? Well, those two were cut from the same cloth. We all saw that. She didn't mind at all, according to Quique. Bastard Quique. Ah, yes, Quique. Salud, Enrique. - Salud. - This is for you. And all because of that damn invitation. MAIL MEXICAN POSTAL SERVICE TO: MR. ENRIQUE GUERRERO And we continue with more news as Universo Musical station celebrates its anniversary with a tribute event to two legends, Irma Pimentel, "La Bomba," and Enrique Guerrero, the voices of Mexican rock and roll radio. And now, time for some more rock and roll. ROCK WITH THE SLEEPWALKERS ABASOLO CORNER SUPERSTORE GROCERY BAGGERS WANTED COME WITH JOB APPLICATION TRIBUTE TO THE GREAT PERSONALITIES THAT BUILT US. RIOVERDE BRIDGE ABASOLO CORNER SUPERSTORE Letters of recommendation, Mr. Enrique? Mm, no, I don't have any. What was your last job? I was in, uh, music business. Were you a host on Universo Musical? Are you the great Enrique Guerrerock of Universo Musical? Yes. In my house, my father used to listen to your program with Bomba Pimentel every day. Oh, what was it? - "This is classics of..." - No, no, no, no, no! No, that's not it. No. Please don't... Don't do that again, all right? Uh... Please, one more time. Could you do it? Welcome, boys and girls to Universo Musical. This is... The Hour of Rock and Roll. Here you go. Good morning. Did you find what you needed? Or not. Picho, you know the code here? Yeah, it's 3090. Jeez, Picho. You really memorize the code for mangoes somehow? Well, I'm studying to become a cashier soon. Hey, Picho. Take a minute after your lunch to explain to Mr. Enrique how everything works here. Yes, sir. As of this moment, we've got a living legend here joining our little gang. Ain't that right? Make yourself at home. I hate the music here. They play it to make you stupid enough that you'd buy anything. - At least it's better than mariachi. - That's true. I guess that would be rough. - Hey, uh... - Hm? You can't smoke in the market. Why not? NO SMOKING So, you two, are you like together, or...? Just friends. Work buddies. Mm-hmm. And you're a bagger. Why? Why aren't you a cashier like your buddy? Well, it's just... Picho here still has to complete high school, so... Well, yes, but... Yeah, I'm on my final exam now. - Mm-hmm. Just one exam left. - So nearly there. Don't forget the most important thing is to open the bag quickly. Using your fingertips like this is the trick, all right? - Mm-hmm. - Good afternoon. - Find what you were looking for? - They should use their own bags. - It's important to think of the planet. - Mm-hmm. As I see the groceries coming, in my head, I usually try to organize it all beforehand - so I'm ready. - Hm. - That's the real trick, okay? - Ah. And, well, it's kinda clear. Dairy with dairy, fruits with fruits, cans with cans, and so on, okay? You are... a genius. That's it? - Oh, the water. - Come on, Rubén. - He always forgets. - I can see why. I'm sure he was distracted by your beauty. Aw, that's so sweet. Thank you. Okay, here it is. Sorry. Your total is $18.56. - Thank you very much. - Thank you. - Come back soon. - Thanks a lot. Excuse me. - Oh, here. For you. Thanks. - Thank you. - Don't forget to clock out. - Take care. See you. Wait just a moment. Don't let her leave on her own, please. Yeah, you got it. Take care, take care. Oh, tomorrow's the meat delivery, so we'll be on the lookout. If there's anything else, give me a call, okay? - Of course. - Take care now. But if we go to the party... - Oh, that would be nice. - See you tomorrow, my friends. - Get some rest. Sleep well, Cipriano. - See you tomorrow. Have a good night. - Eh? - "Sleep well," he said. Oh no, I'm not driving. I'll take the bus. See you tomorrow, Mr. Enrique. Get your rest. You talk a lot for someone who can't hear. The new guy is cool, isn't he? I don't know, Amanda. He broke the 50-50 rule. - What? No, seriously? - He took half the tips. He didn't even pack well. - That's what I told him. - He packed four things. You know what he told me? That he did public relations, - and that makes him more money. - Of course. He's an artist. I don't think I like him, to be honest. Nah, he's cool. I like his shoes. There goes our bus. Who was it that said that thing about Finito, the Mexican boxer. The little guy from, uh... He said, "It's a good thing that boy isn't a heavyweight, otherwise he would have killed everybody. He was very good, Finito. How's it going, boys? - Fine. - What's up? - How are you, Marito? - Oh, bad, Enrique. I've been taking Viagra just so I can have a real piss. Oh, don't say that, now. Hey, I don't say it. It's my wife who does. Güero! Yeah, I'm coming. I put the ice cubes in the sink. How 'bout that? So you can't say I never bring anything. How splendid is that. Mm, I guess there's gotta be a first time for everything, huh? - Now what? - "Now what?" Anything you would like? Do you remember Bonene? - Sure I do. - Yeah. He got cancer. I'm sorry to hear that. But a big one, or a small one? Small one. It's not big or small. You got it, and that's it. Well, he only had a little cancer. Because otherwise, he would be dead. And he's still on his feet, you know? I don't believe in cancer. Once you get it, then you've got no reason to be worrying, you know? It's already happened. Or, if you don't get it, it means you don't get it, and that's it. Nothing happens at all. Sure. You guys get that? This man's a philosopher. I think you should look into a patent, or get started on a book, 'cause that thing you said just now... not a thing of that made sense to me! - Okay. Salud, salud, salud. - Salud, salud. Mm. Oh, wait, Chiquilingas. Mm-hmm? That magazine. Enrique should see what you read there. Oh, right. Take a look at this. I don't know who Wendy Salim is, and I don't care about her plastic surgery. No, no, don't be an asshole. That's not the article. - The one on the side. - Ah. "Universo Musical is getting ready for its anniversary party." And... will you go? Of course I'll go! Obviously. It's my tribute, you bastards. They're paying for our hotel and everything. What about La Bomba? Yeah. How long since you've seen the woman? About 20 years? No. More, Marito. But everybody knows all things must end. I even got a new job now. Ha! You're working? Look, even Quique is working now. Yeah, right. Thank you. What are you doing tonight? I'm going to that thing at Nico's. You should come. - It starts early. Like 8:00 or 9:00. - Hey, pardon me. I'm sorry. - Your name is Picho, right? - Yeah, why? It's the bagger on aisle five. He told me to get you. He wants to talk to you. - Said it's urgent. Yes. - Cipriano? Okay. - Cipriano. - What's up, Pichito? - What happened? - With what? Well, then, Amanda. Ready to make millions? Sure, why not? Hey, I mean it. You like dancing to rock and roll? - You could tell? - Yeah. He didn't need to talk to me. - No? - No. That's strange. Okay, move over. I told you that I'm not a fan of sharing my earnings here. Well, you can't bag solo until you've completed three days of training with a partner, so excuse me. I don't need three days to learn how to put a bunch of cans in a grocery bag. It's not like I dropped out of high school. You just gonna take that, Picho? All right, geezer. Register four is free. Are you being disrespectful? All right, Amanda. Explain to the geezer here - that even though he's an old man... - No, uh-uh. Don't bring me into this. Welcome, boys and girls, to Universo Musical. This is The Hour of Rock and Roll. Gives me chills every time. - Right? - Yeah. Look, I'm not a man who often asks for favors, but this case is really special. Well, I'd be happy to help any way I can, Enrique. Let's get Picho at another lane. - Picho? - It's just all our tips get cut in half. And the boy really needs all he can get. Mm-hmm. So look, think of the boy here. You're a good person. Well, all right. Excuse me, ma'am. It's just... I'm having a hard time with Parkinson's. No, don't worry, sir. Here. Let me help you. I could already tell you'd like that music. I love this song. I used to know the biggest Apson fan of all. La Bomba. Every time they played, bah! She exploded. And she would dance. Like this? Yeah, almost as good. Bomba. Enrique, do you have Parkinson's? - I'm just looking for tips. - Mm. I need to fix my car. Well, I'm sorry to tell you with your skill set here, I don't think that you'll get much. I know. But it's all right. I still have my savings. Hm. Well, okay, Enrique, I gotta go now, but I'll see you tomorrow. - Good night. - See you later, Amanda. I still have some things to do around here. See you tomorrow, Picho. Show me what you got in there. Hey, kid, I'll show you something else if you don't move it. No. Give it to me. Give it to me! I'm gonna open it right here so everybody can see you're a thief. No, no, no, no, no. Don't do it. Don't do it. Just leave it. Don't you understand? I need the cash. Yeah, we all need it. But we're not all shoplifting douchebags like you. Fine. Listen to me. Just don't rat me out. I'm risking my life here. What do you want from me? My bag! Help me! Anyone! We have to stay strong against all crime. SENIOR CITIZEN HERO PREVENTS SUPERMARKET ROBBERY It's not okay to go around stealing from anyone, robbing them. We must be good people. - Exactly. Please tell... - And... would you like to hear my advice for the younger generation? Listen to what your heart tells you. No robbing. And above all else, listen to rock and roll. On behalf of the company, I want to express our utmost appreciation for you, Mr. Enrique. - Oh, no. - You are a hero. And we want to compensate you for that. This is a gesture without precedent in the company, and we believe it fits your honor. What do you think? ENRIQUE GUERRERO HONORARY SECURITY GUARD I can't believe he got a promotion. Picho, you were there. What did you do? I don't know. I might have done a bunch of things. Mm-hmm. Like what? Because, I mean, I didn't see your name on the news or anything. I'm not sure. It was just happening so fast. Okay. You have to accept that it was brave, what he did. What are you doing later? There's a party. - I have to study. - Mm. Couldn't you just study later? You spend all your time working, Picho. You've gotta have fun. Yeah, but I gotta bring money home to my mom. You know how she is. Abusive, huh? - She is not. - Picho, - could I see you for a minute? - No, we're leaving now. I really need to speak with you. I'm about to walk Amanda home. I don't have time. Please, seriously. It'll only take a minute. Don't worry. I can walk alone. - See you tomorrow, Enrique. - See you tomorrow. If you change your mind, Picho, let me know. Or not. Okay, come on. Or do you want me to call security? So what is this? Take a look. Tell me, what do you see? Garbage. No, no, no, no, no. You've gotta look closer. Tell me what you see. Look, I don't know what you want from me, but I'm not going to rat on you. Relax. No, no, no. Now that's not important. I want you to help me. And why would I do that? Because I'm going to help you with Amanda. How so? Picho, every time you see her, you start drooling. But if you think you're gonna win her over just by walking her to her house, no way. Look at you. You're still such a boy. Well you just need to be rebellious. You need rock and roll. Eh? Rock and roll! But I'm already... rebellious. Oh yeah? Then I'll be waiting for you at 10:00 p.m. at the intersection of General Ramírez Portela and Niño Artillero Street. Come on, get in. What are we doing here? We're going to get the cardboard from the supermarket. If we sell it, we can make good money. Let's go 50-50. We'll be a team, just like you wanted. But that belongs to the market. It's just trash from the market. Just like us. We're even lower than trash at the market. We're just pawns. We're their leftovers. We're nothing. No, I don't steal from there. They're the ones who are stealing. Have you seen how they change the labels on things before the discounts? Haven't you seen how they put the fucked-up fruit in the front? You see what they charge for one avocado, a lemon, marmalade? They're the real thieves. - Well, maybe so. But that... - Don't you want to win Amanda? Fine. Ah. You able to drive? Yeah. I was just curious. The only person who can drive this car, other than me, is La Bomba. Are you serious? You have got to be kidding. I figure every time we fill up the garage, we'll get 8,000 pesos. Hey, Enrique. I did my part. Are you gonna come through? No money until we sell the cardboard. No advances. No, not that. With Amanda. Ah. You mean the ladies. - What's up? - What's up? How you doing? What did you do? That a little hello? You friends now? We're more associates. Associates, eh? In what? There are no written rules, my dear Picho. But the important thing is that she starts to wonder about you. Okay, but how do I do that? You don't have to do much. Let her know you have your mysteries. We all like mysteries. - No, no, I can't tell you. - But I wouldn't say anything. I can't. Okay, okay. So mysterious. Give him a rebel cut. Look at that. - Elvis Pichón! - What do you think, Pichón? Like? This French rum is getting better every year. Okay, let's see. Bottoms up. Hey, I put a lot of heart in that. Ugh. Oh, Quique. - I need you to do me a favor, Güero. - Mm. My ride is in the shop. Lend me your Ichi. What's an Ichi? It's a kind of van. Come on. Lend me your truck. Just don't load too much weight in the back, Quique. Well, no, it's not much. Just a few crates of cardboard. This is the one that all the ladies are using. But I've hardly got any hair on my own head now, brother. Well, that's why, Marito. Get the most of it. 1,500... and 1,000... makes 2,500, plus 360 makes 2,860. If we keep this up, you're gonna get rich off cardboard, Picho. But you forgot 500, no? Guess what? I have a little surprise for you, brother. What? I took that money and put it in a savings account I set up for you. It'll be good. Why would that be good? Take my word for it. Even I'd put money in that fund. Just think, in a couple of months, we could actually have some real cash saved up. Wow. What did you do? - Looks good, huh? - Do you like it? - It looks modern, right? - Mm. It comes across more vintage. - Vintage? - Uh-huh. You look cool, Picho. I like it. Mm? Told you. You can trust me. Don't you just want to get out of here? And go where? I don't know. I'd go back to the United States or Mexico City. You know, wherever the coolest bands are playing. Well, I'd take a vacation. Where to? I don't know. Los Angeles, to visit my father and some uncles. One day, I'm getting out of here, and I will never return. Want to come to the party at Tania's? It's at ten. Even the Filet Mignon is coming. - That deli counter asshole? - Yes, that one. Does that mean you don't want to come with me? No, I do. Doesn't look like it. Picho, you never go out. When I invite you, you don't even want to try. You're making it tough for me. I swear, I do want to go, but... Okay, I'll text you when I finish studying, all right? Deal. You're playing hard to get. Turns out vintage Picho's an asshole too, huh? I swear I'll be there. Holding you to it. Enrique, you said we'd be fast tonight. Come on! Enrique! What? Let's go! Gold, Picho. This is a gold mine. AMANDA: HURRY UP, PICHO! SEE WHAT YOU'RE LIKE? It's easy, man. We ask Güero to help us. ARE YOU STILL THERE? In a couple of nights, we'll have grabbed it all. You know how much they pay for steel? A fortune. That's why the Chinese are fighting the gringos. And it's right there, tons of it at our fingertips. I'm not sure about this. You know how long's it been there? For years. And besides, it doesn't belong to anyone. Huh? We would be doing them a favor, Picho. AMANDA HURRY UP, IT'S AWESOME!!! Make this thing go faster? Well, are you in or out? - Yeah, but step on it. - Fifty-fifty. - Okay. - Minus the cost of gas. Step on it? - Yep. - Say no more, my friend. No way. Pull over. Don't screw around. I don't want to go to jail tonight. Shut up. Nobody's going to jail. La Bomba and I got out of a million of these. - Will I make it to see Amanda? - Sure. Trust me. Good evening to you, officer. Can I ask what you're doing? Uh, yes, of course. Tonight we've been recycling cardboard. You don't say. And the kid? Uh, he's my godson. You gonna answer? Yeah. You know, you really can't drive around with that load. I know, boss. And I hope that you'll forgive me, officer, but, I mean, how can we live with the pollution of our planet? And the poor turtles have been dying in the ocean with all that littered cardboard. - Mmm. - Yeah. We're helping the turtles. And that's why we're here. Step out of the vehicle for me, sir. - And, uh, bring your papers, please. - With pleasure. Don't even move, okay? I'm handling this. SEARCH CONTACTS AMANDA Amanda's not answering her phone now. She's probably asleep by now. Keep playing hard to get. We're gonna have to get those pipes. We just gotta figure out when. I'm thinking next week's the best choice. Hey, Enrique. Who's La Bomba? You wouldn't get it. Try me. La Bomba is the most fantastic human being in the universe. Where is she? Mexico City. Why? She and I had a radio program. But I don't like to talk about it. I'm sorry. Before that, nobody listened to rock. We got big, and then the station only wanted her. And, well, I got cocky. But I should have understood. She was a star. Oh, fucking Irma. She was the love of my life. It's been 20 years since I saw her. And you know why? 'Cause I'm embarrassed. And, well, that doesn't really work for a shameless bastard like me. But... all things must come to an end, my Picho. Hm? I'm gonna pee. THE BEST MUSIC OF THE YEAR SELECTED BY "LA BOMBA" PIMENTEL WE WILL BE CLOSING AT 6:30 P.M. TODAY WE RESUME OUR USUAL HOURS TOMORROW Welcome! The Abasolo Supermarket would like to thank you all for your work, and celebrate with this family dinner.

There are mole tortitas, jellies made by Consuelito, and sign up for the raffle. There are great prizes. - Come here. - This is your night, champ. She won't even look at me. Don't worry about it.

But, well, you see, we'll be really good tonight. We just came to feel the Christmas spirit. Picho, do you happen to know these gentlemen? Yeah, they work at La Jarochita. It's a barbershop. Very vintage. I hope you're familiar with that particular style nowadays. Oh, when Quique invited us to be his guests, we were thrilled. Anytime he puts on his playlist, it's a great party. - Enrique Guerrero? - That's him. There. There he is. What am I saying? Make yourself at home. Enjoy yourselves. - Ah, thank you, thank you. - You're welcome. Oh, sure! How splendid is that. What a party. Let's get to it. Come on, boys. No, I'm being serious. If I'm in the mood to rock instead. And what puts you in the mood? Well, good music, first of all. Good music... Didn't I just hear you listening to Taylor Swift? What did you hear? Wait, who, me? Yeah. I doubt it. You sure? Hey, there. Oh, good evening. - Ramón, right? - Yes, yes. - Shall we dance? - Oh no, I... Aw, come on. Leave your drink here. - Well, well, it's just that... - Don't worry. Relax. Come on. We can have fun too. Let's go dance. Fuckin' queer. Come on. Try it! Move! That's it! AMANDA: MY BATTERY IS DYING. SEE YOU SOON. Oh no, no! What are people going to say? What... I had a blast. I could tell. Yeah, me too. All right, I'm gonna say bye to... to Quique. - Uh-huh. - Then we'll go. Quique. - What's happening, brother? - I'm leaving. I'm really tired. I'm gonna... Well, Ramón lives near me, so I'm gonna head out with him. - Have a good night. - See you later. You too. Cipriano! - Huh? - What's up? Come on. What do you mean "what's up?" Because of you, the women have all left the party. What are you saying? I never stole your drink. No, no, no, no. I said "women." You know, the babies, the ladies. The ones we were dancing with. All right. Come on, let's go. See? Look at you, look at you. Every time... Ladies and gentlemen, this was... The Hour of Rock and Roll. That was incredible. You should get in there and... and dance yourself. That Consuelito is truly something. I'll remind you that I only ever dance with La Bomba. All right. Back up, grandpa. I'm gonna close it. What's that? Wait, did you steal that? Well, in a way, they gave it to me. Who did? The market. The ma... The market? You gotta be... Picho. You gotta be kidding me. Look at yourself, man. Oh yeah, he's drunk. He's probably been drinking all night. Let's see, get up. Oh, up! What? What's wrong? - No, nothing, nothing. - You need to get that checked out. - What about your appointment with Rosas? - No, it's all good. I'm fine. Picho. Where do you live? I don't know. Who cares? Okay, let me see your wallet. Do you know where the Arturo Montiel neighborhood is? In hell, if I had to guess. With a name like that, it's gotta be a... Yeah, right. Come on. Let's go, let's go. Picho. Picho. We're here. Is this place your house? No. Then which one is it? I have no home here... anymore. Then where? All I want... is to find a set of wings... and fly... ...and walk amongst the stars. Don't say that, amigo. You're drunk. No. No. All I want to do is leave. I work my ass off studying, and with my job. To become a fucking cashier? To try and get cash for my mom? But why? But why? To live a better life? What does that even mean? I just wanna be a rabbit. So I could hop around, with no one fucking me over. - Calm down there, Bugs Bunny. - I'm serious, Enrique. Why would I want to stay Picho? To be a human? Nobody else really cares. Picho. You do have me. Huh? I'm your friend. It's gonna be all right. It's gonna be all right. Huh? Hey, out, out! Outside! Watch out for the jacket. Ah, no, no! Don't wipe it on the jacket! - Ungrateful. - Sorry. She'll kill me. Don't worry about that. It'll be all right. Careful. Ah, good evening, ma'am. Brought home your boy. Thank you. - Thank you, Enrique. - Mm. Come here. Get inside. Look at yourself. What do you care? What do you mean? Come here. Is that any way to talk to your mom? Huh? Where'd you get that jacket? Where'd you get that jacket? I'm talking to you! Enrique lent it to me. Oh, Enrique. Uh-huh. Your drinking buddy? Huh? Feel like that? You like that? You gonna get drunk every day now, like your father? No, Mom. Where's the money? What'd you do with the money? Tell me! Look me in the eyes! Mom! What did you do with the money? Go get in the shower. ...CHRC. Spectacular radio. Pichardo Pipes. Tubes, scales, and connecting. All the pipes you need, in any diameter. Immediate delivery. Perfect for any budget. Pichardo Pipes.

You okay, man? Picho, are you ignoring me? Mm. Uh, what's this? Cleaned it up. Enrique, I-I need to talk to you. Ah, don't worry about it. I'm leaving early to catch up with Güero and the Ichi. I'll meet you at the usual place. Way I see it, we only need two trips to get everything. Yeah, that's what I want to talk about. I'm out. I don't wanna. I sorta told my mom. The cardboard, our whole night shift thing. All of it. Are you stupid or what? All due respect, Picho, you've completely lost it. It's money for picking up trash. It's just there for the taking. You could move out of your house, invite Amanda... Come on, she has a boyfriend already. - So what are you saying? - That I'm not coming. Well, this is happening with or without you, Picho. Because that's it. Life happens with you or without you. We're allowed to be here this late? I'm the security guard. Open the trunk so we can start loading. Do you swear you have permission? Yeah, brother. - You promise? - Look. It's just trash. You're joking. What? What's wrong? No. - Seriously, no. I won't do it. - Yes, you will. You open the trunk, we pack the Ichi, and we're out of here. Do it as a favor for your old friend Enrique, huh? You can't be asking for these favors. You know full well I'm bad at this type of thing. You know that. I'm not as rebellious as you. What don't you get? I gotta go to the event at the station, and you know I need the cash. Just to see La Bomba? I have to go. How about a phone call? No, no. I gotta see her personally, man. I've decided that now I gotta make things right with her. Give me a hand here, come on. You're my best friend. All right. Tomorrow we'll get together at Jarochita and come up with a way to get the money, okay? But tonight, yeah, let's leave. Know something, man? I think the guys were right. You are a fucking queer. Wanna repeat that? Yeah. I said you're a fucking queer. You take the van. And bring it back whenever. EMPLOYEE OF THE MONTH ENRIQUE In ten years, where do you see yourself? Rising within the company. Nice. Very nice, Picho. Your attitude, the rebelliousness of a leader. Your style, that's mine as well. Congratulations. But I... haven't finished my school exams yet. Don't be ridiculous. This supermarket is your home. CHECKOUT CLOSED Hello. You find everything all right? Hey, Picho. Why haven't we seen your buddy Enrique? He's not my buddy. Ah, whatever you say. When he gets here, I was going to ask for the phone number for that Mario. Or Marito. I just love the way he dances. You must have seen the way we were pulling, right? Oh look! You look so handsome when you smile. Always so serious. MISSED CALL I was sitting alone in the garden when this beautiful lady sat down. I mean, not to brag to you, but she was a... demigoddess. And she says to me, "I'm gonna sit next to you because it's cold." - Ahh. - Mmm... mm! And... and then what? Eh... What'd you do? - I don't remember. - Ah. Oh, Manuel. How on earth could you forget? After all, she is your wife now. Ah, yes, yes! We got married! Hey. Are you a big-shot cashier now, or what? Picho, you can't be ignoring me for the rest of your life. Try me, I guess. You talk to Enrique? No. Well, you might want to try to talk to him soon, because he sounds pretty bad. Couldn't you tell your boyfriend all this stuff? What? Don't try to hide it. Filet Mignon. Oh, okay. Is that why you're like this? Picho, you don't actually care about that, do you? I wish I didn't care about it, but I still do. Besides, that guy seems like a jerk. Picho, look, thank you for worrying about me, but I'm a grown woman. I know what I'm doing. Speak to Enrique, okay? He's been looking for you for a while. Enrique! Enrique! Enrique! Oh, come on, dammit. Fucking Enrique. What happened? Amanda told me it was bad. Well, well. Ramón already made you a cashier. I need you to do me a favor. Yeah, me too, Enrique. I want my money from the savings account. All right. Don't get mad at me, brother, but I already borrowed it. It's a matter of life and death. - To fix a fucking Mustang? - Yes. Come on, Enrique. Don't take me for an asshole here. I've needed an operation for quite a long time now. - Operation? - It's a hernia. We have to go to Mexico City. - What do you mean, "we"? - Well, I need you, man. - I can't be driving like this. - Sure, but I'm not able to go. You have to take me, because it's your fault to begin with. How is this my fault, Enrique? If you hadn't left me to carry the metal alone, I wouldn't have got injured. I did my part, and you did not. - I'm sorry, but I can't bring you. - Picho! Picho, you think I like asking for favors? You think I want to let someone else drive my baby? - I'm not gonna be able to drive. - I told you I'm not taking you. - So go get someone else. - I already got someone. And, yeah, she'll be coming too. She's a good friend of mine. That's perfect. You're going with her, then. Yeah, I'm going with her. The problem is that Amanda can't drive my car. Which Amanda? Let's go. How long's the drive? If it's pedal to the metal, seven hours. Seven hours? - A little less on the highway. - Okay. Wanna split the gas between the three of us? What do you say? All right, sure. I'll pay 200. Yeah, Picho's got it. Thanks, Picho. Turn it up. Woo-hoo! Hey, is it true what they say? What do they say? That Mexico City is pretty dangerous, huh? Yes and no. How do I explain? You do have to stay careful, but you always have to enjoy it. All right, but is it dangerous or not? Because I once heard that if you get in the wrong taxi, you'll get taken. Nah. It's not that bad at all. You do have to stay cautious, because some people are tricky. - Like you. - No, that's different. I'm just tricky because I'm old now. And you were a saint when you were young? We having a conversation about Mexico City or me? It's a city with 20 million people in it. Of course it's got its fair share of sleaze. But you know what I love most about that filthy city? - What? - It's like... some kind of big, huge broth that's alive, and it's boiling. It's some, uh, huge pozole, as a city. What kind of meat? Mixed. It's the best city in the world. Fuck, I had only been in the back to conk out. What does that mean? - No fucking way. - Excuse me? There's just no fucking way. Wow! You're telling me you really kiss your grandma with that mouth, lady? Look at it. I mean... It's gigantic. It's perfection. I thought I was never going to get out of Rioverde. You've never left Rioverde? No. You mean you've never even been to San Luis? No. Not even to Media Luna? Well, I did go there when I was very little, but I don't remember much. Roll down that window more. Let the smog in. Okay. - You're Mr. Guerrero? - Yes, that's me. Here are your rooms, 324 and 328. You need help with your baggage? - No, thank you. - Take the elevator to floor three. Okay. All right, thank you. Hey, but how come you booked us two rooms, though? You don't want us sleeping in the same room, all three of us, do you? Like we're some kind of hippies? Amanda. This hotel is super cool. It's like old. Like vintage. Like you, Enrique. Hasn't changed much at all. Now explain to me exactly what you mean by "vintage" there. Ah. It's like something old that never went out of style. This okay here? Yeah, leave it there. It's fine. Picho, check this out! We got a mini fridge, dude! - Come look! - All right. Picho, wait. Go to dinner. It's the returns from your savings account. Don't you want us to stay with you? No. Picho, there's a bubble bath! Come on, already! All right! Go on, then. Ah, there's more. Take this. Don't keep Amanda waiting. Come on. Go on. Thank you. See ya. I didn't imagine Mexico City this way. How did you picture it? Well, dirty. You? Yeah, I guess me too. - Know what I've been thinking? - What? Enchiladas? - Sure. - Where? Enrique mentioned a couple places. - Cool, let's go. - Yeah, let's find one. Are you over it? What? The Filet thing. What can I say? "It's all fine." Yes, it's all fine. Fucking vintage Picho, dude. I can't eat another bite. Well, we'll bring it back to the hotel. Enrique want anything? - Well, I think he went to bed. - You think? I don't know. If I were waiting for a doctor to cut me open, I'd be nervous. You think he's okay? They say weeds never die. You should call him. - You know what I've been thinking? - What? You and I should stay here. And live here? Hello? Um, good evening. Excuse me. Could I get room 328, please? Yes, with Enrique Guerrero. Uh, Picho. What? He went out and left us invitations. Hey, hey, hey, hey. Yeah. Thank you. Uh-huh, uh-huh. - My bugger. - Hey, can I help you? - Excuse me, so sorry. - Don't worry about it. - I mistook you for someone else. - No, no. Uh... What's up, what's up? How's everybody doing tonight? What's up? Welcome to the celebration of the anniversary of your home station, the radio station that's brought us so much joy throughout the years. Tonight, I want you to help me with a very special tribute, because, as you know, a couple days ago, Irma Pimentel, "La Bomba," passed away. She went before her time, so I would like to pay tribute to her and the others we've lost. If you'd join me in a round of applause. Please, to a great talent. She will be missed. She had a special place in our homes and in our hearts, and truly was the voice of a generation. She was La Bomba. But thankfully, it's not all sad news today. We have a special guest. We are very fortunate to have an icon with us tonight, a pillar of the industry. Someone who has contributed so much to this station. So I want you please to help me warmly welcome none other than the legend, the one and only, Quique Guerrero! You're up, Quique. Come on over, Quique. Let's go, Quique. Why did you stop listening to rock and roll? What are you clapping for? You don't even know what rock and roll is or who La Bomba was. Do you even know Chuck Berry? Jerry Lee Lewis? You don't even know The Apsons, The Crazy Ones, or The Teen. Enrique? Johnny? Angélica? All the music you listen to comes from rock. You don't know nothing! Rock and roll isn't dead. And rock and roll is never gonna die! - It's never gonna die! - Okay. Let's just... No, get off me! Get away! I said rock and roll is never gonna die. It's never gonna die, Picho. You know, when they put up the Diana, the wife of the then president objected to them putting up a statue of a naked woman here. And then the authorities had the brilliant idea to go and put a loincloth on it. Many years later, they took it off, but when they took it off, they messed it up. They had to put in a replica statue. I think the original one is in Hidalgo, or something like that. And since then, some kids started a tradition of going out drinking and then dressing her up. And then, little by little, Diana, in the morning, was fully dressed. One of those nights... one night, in such a glorious, just a wonderful bender, I came here with La Bomba too. And she... she danced up to it, took off her brassiere, she climbed up all the way... and she put it on her. She put it on her. Ah, fucking Irma. She was tremendous, tremendous. Nothing could slow her down. On the other hand, I... Quique. I let time slip away, like some asshole. I'm an asshole. Well, if La Bomba was that cool, I think she deserves a proper tribute. Come on. DID YOU FIND WHAT YOU WERE LOOKING FOR? I think Quique went out the way he was supposed to. Smiling all the way until the end. Why didn't you stay in Mexico City, Picho? Yeah, I could have, but... when that fucking loser Filet Mignon got there, - I figured I better get out of there. - Oh, Picho. Güero! - Hey. - The drinks are ready. Right, right, right. - They didn't have any juice for the kid. - Okay. Only booze for the men. Okay. Here's the dark one for you. Thank you. Ooh, that's strong. Well, you trying to get me fucked up, or what? Hey, it was the only thing left. - Oh yeah? - Yes. - Guess what. - What? Guess. How splendid is that! - Güero! - Huh? - The dominoes are in. - Coming. Yeah, hurry, hurry! - Cheers! - Cheers! At least you kept the Mustang. Yeah, well, I'm going to use it to pay for school. Oh, and the jacket too. I'm going to keep it. That's nice. Come on, come on, Picho. And what happened with Rosita, huh? Rosita, she wanted a champion's blood. So what did I do? I gave it to her. It's taking so long. So are you guys ready for me to beat you, or what? - We'll see about that. - Take a pick.
