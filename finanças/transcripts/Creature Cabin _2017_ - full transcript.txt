I quite like the bit, the bit I liked quite a lot was when the music, it went up, (Stoner snoring) and then it went down, and then faster, that piece, I liked it. Does anyone in the actual band like this song? Yeah. Are you fucking kidding me? Well, no what if, what if you guys dressed up as instruments and then you dressed up the instruments like people? And then you could be the first ever instrument playing human, instrument playing human band, that's pretty sick. (bong bubbling) Where did you even come from? (Stoner coughs) Does, do we have anything else? All right, we've been working on a new one. Oh, thank fuck. BAND MEMBER: It's only rough, it's just, just an idea. Let's hear it. Okay.

Oscar, can I have a word in my office. ? Three, four ? Take a seat. Do you know how many different kinds of putter there are in the game of golf? I've never felt like that's something I might need to know. There's blade putters, center-shafted, mallet putters, the list goes on. Yes, it does rather. Why do you think there's so many different types to choose from? Umm. Because it's important to find the right kind of putter to suit your individual style. The correct tool to get the job done. I'm sure you see where I'm going with all this. I wouldn't be too sure. He's telling you that you're fired. Got it, bravo! I'm afraid you simple don't fit in, Oscar. What? Consider this an opportunity to take the time to branch out. Now my cousin Ramsey's place. Don't ask for a discount, he's, he's not my favorite cousin. Too-da-loo, too-da-lo.

Who the fuck needs to be in a band? Just be a lead singer, fuck 'em. Oh hey, Oz. How was band practice? OSCAR: Yeah, it was fucking brilliant. I got kicked out, so that's great. Ooh, steak knives. OSCAR: Where's Tim, his car's not outside? Yeah, he left just after you did. OSCAR: Do you know where Misty is? He took her with him. Where's the sofa? He took that too. I thought it was odd at the time, but you know Tim, he's always rearranging things. Balls. Oh, Oz, he's run off on you hasn't he? Fucking cockwomble. Yeah, look don't worry about him. He's a loser. Look, you're free now. You get to concentrate on your music. You know be that awesome rock star that you always wanted to be. The band kicked me out. Oh, right. Wait here. There is a silver lining.

Let the summoning commence. (thunder rumbling) Uh, this is making me a little bit uncomfortable. Do you think we could have like a safe word or something? It's just- It's about the blood, Oz. (group speaking in foreign language) Your blood, yes. (chains rattling) Hello, could somebody help me please? Hello!

Sounds like a terrible idea. Besides I'd just be third wheeling anyway. Oh, well I just might get Bo to bring his hot cousin. No, no, and no. Self-pity and ice cream for me. Besides where are you going anyway? Uh, the place that you recommended. I don't recommend places. Recommending's like not my thing. RAIN: Are you still drunk? No. On the fridge, you put it there.

(eerie rock music) ? Won't ya tell me what you wanna do ? ? I can hardly find you ? ? Tell me where you're gonna be ? ? I can not see ? BO: (indistinct). (ominous music) It's definitely not as advertised. BO: All right people, keep it moving, keep it moving. Don't we need to check in first? BO: Oh, no, there's a key under the mat. Somewhere. Wait, where'd she go? WILMER: Who? This is the place. Perfect. Oh, man, look at this rug. Come check this rug out. This thing's incredible. (indistinct). I assure you that's not necessary. BO: Come get on this fur. I'm just gonna watch. (suspenseful music) Thomas Dather, 15th century masterpiece, summoning the unicorn. It's classic. OSCAR: It's ugly. Ugly is in the eye of the beholder, Oscar. You know it's said that this paining is under a demon's curse. Did they have wheelchairs in the 15th century? Uh, yeah, yeah, of course. You know that's about the time they were invented. Come on, bar's open. Come on boys, let's get this party started. (Cameron laughing) (lips smacking) (Wilmer coughing) I've successfully set the whole place on fire. What else needs doing? (laughs) everything. WILMER: There's room for two. Uh, I usually bathe solo. Most things are better with a friend. Bathing doubly so. Look nothing personal, I mean you seem like a nice guy and everything, and- It's cool. Let's just go hang with Bo and Rain. Okay, (laughs) safety in numbers, right. This is much less awkward. Spa actually, yeah. (suspenseful music) Yeah. (Cameron laughing) (unicorn neighing) (unicorn snorting) (rock music) BO: Oh this rug feels like Satan. (suspenseful music) (water bubbling) Well, that looks inviting.

BO: Yo, what up cunts? Dude, dudette Ah, dude, pants. BO: Ah, come on baby, give me a hug you big hairy gay bird. Don't come any closer otherwise I'll knock your head clean off. WILMER: Whoa, what the hell? He's not human, trust me. He's as human as you and me, Oscar. You tried to killed me. Well, that's not true. I'd never try and kill you. Did every one take the brown acid while I was gone? Let's just calm down. And put some fucking clothes on. Come on Oz, stop fuckin' around. Let's go toast some marshmallows. Do I look like I'm fucking around! (shovel thuds) Really? This is how you treat- (shovel thuds) Enough! What the hell is wrong with you? Nothing's wrong with me, something's wrong with them, you just don't see it. Listen, whatever's going on with you we'll figure it out, okay. We'll make it all right. Look at me. I'm not a threat, I'm a friend. Give me the shovel, okay. (hand thuds) (Oscar screams) I'm sorry I had to do that, but you're acting lie a crazy bitch. (suspenseful music) OSCAR: Where'd they go? Seriously, take the paranoia back a bit. Let's just calm down and try and find them. (Oscar yells) What did you do? You're one of them aren't you? Them? There's no them, you're delusional. I might be wrong but I'm not taking any chances. Please, please for pity's sake. Please. I know what I saw. I'm not crazy. I know you're not crazy. But you are a bitch! (Wilmer grunts) (Oscar groaning) (insects chirping) You know you should really learn to trust your instincts. You were right, you're not crazy. You're the chosen one. And I'm sorry to say, but being the chosen one really sucks. (fist thuds) (Oscar groans) (eerie rock music) (Oscar gasps) OSCAR: What? ? Everything around me turned to stone ? ? Left with my heart broken ? ? I'm all alone ? ? Need to get outta here ? ? Clear up my mind ? ? Leave what's been hurting me ? ? Before I go blind ? ? Staring at the picture that he's painted on the wall ? ? Watching these demons as ? You don't belong here ? Everyone around me underneath his wicked spell ? ? I'm drowning in blood ? ? As they drag me to hell ? ? Suddenly a spider is calling for me ? ? Scratching from the fangs ? ? And watching carefully ? ? Demonic horse flying with a horn upon its head ? ? And far into the dark woods I can see the living dead ? (Evil Oscar laughing) ? The living dead ? ? Take me cabin ? ? Take me to the woods ? ? I'll chain you in the darkness ? ? Rot there for good ? ? You'll never have me as your pure sacrifice ? (Evil Oscar pops) (Evil Oscar laughing) ? Staring at the picture that he's painted ? Come with me. ?

Taking stock of every little rule you break ? ? If it's not tough enough ? ? To shake things up ? ? The why is all I'm thinking ? ? And my mind is sinking to a whole new stinking level ? ? And you ? ? You start to scream ? ? Baby, stop playing baby ? ? Yeah, you drive me crazy ? ? Yeah, come on save me ? ? And I'll blow your mind ? (suspenseful music) Fine let's play it your way. (Oscar grunts) (painting scratching) You, you're going down. (fire crackling) That's right, burn you little bastard. Oh, you think, (laughs) you think do you. Well, we'll just see about that. (Oscar laughs) Well, well, well, look what we have here my friends. Oh, this is sharp. Very sharp. Think we could probably have a little bit of fun with this. When I cut the fuck out of you.

Hello. WHEELS: The painting. I've seen it before out by a pool of blood. It's changed. Yeah, it does that. Earlier it was a picture of you being dragged into a pool of blood. Did that happen for real? Yeah, out there. Same thing happened to my friends and now they're demons. So what's special about you? (painting scratching) Damn evil painting. Maybe I could try burning it again. Don't be stupid you know that won't work you've already tried. Maybe I could drop it in that magic pool of blood. Yes, but every time you try to leave the stupid cabin you just end up right back where you started. Well, you can't get away. Maybe we could get the cripple to lead us. The cripple. We don't have another choice. We're really going to trust the cripple. That's our only option. Okay, you're going to lead us to that magic pool of blood and then I'm gonna cut you loose, deal? Yeah, no, put that away. (ominous music) Which way? Through the forest here. All right, let's go. Bloody hell. Goddamn, this would be so much fucking easier if you could walk you know.

Well, that's really not the question. I mean there's only so much we can tell from an interview. Ultimately only you know if you're the right man for the job or if she is? Who's she? Who the fuck is she? Oscar, meet Oscar. (Evil Oscar laughs) One of you is the right kind of putter and one of you is surplus to requirements. She's not me, I'm me. Oh, she certainly is you or part of you at least. We all got a dark side kiddo, and you (laughs). Push the right buttons and you go into the stratosphere. No, I don't, I don't!
