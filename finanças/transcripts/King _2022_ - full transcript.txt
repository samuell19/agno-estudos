Why not wait for me? Want me to carry your bag? You want something. No, nothing. - What are you doing? - Nothing. Alex, what're you looking at? I'm looking at the sun, at life... We're so lucky to live here. Has she found her present? Film it, jerk! What the hell? Ok? I didn't post it. I swear. They wanted your reaction. You know them. You know what they do. Get out of my room. Please, no... You're crazy! I said I can't look after Hugo! I'm rushed off my feet! What? What? You're going away? He's your son too. Wait, you can't do this to me! Stéphanie! Here I am! Sorry I'm late. I was waiting at the office. Found the hole? Rabbits probably showed the way. To get through, it's 3 or 4 months old. I saw the video. A lion cub in front of the Paris-Tokyo flight rarely goes unnoticed. It can't be far. I just hope we don't find it as roadkill. Well, I pray we do. I'm worried it may have typhus, rabies or worse. Worse? If it bites anyone, our unit is responsible. Understand, Sauvage? Yes, ma'am. Carry on! Go, go! My day, Mum? Three kids spoke to me. Two to make fun of me and one to ask for my Tipp-Ex. Look what I found after three months. They were with your things. Which do you prefer? Your one holiday with him? On the run in Brazil? He even missed your funeral. Stay in the corner! Don't stare at me. It's not my fault. Talking to yourself? Who is? Inès? She cooked it with the head on? "Kiss me, Inès." Still mad at me? I think we can start. Damn... I really am useless at family meals. Done your homework? When do you start tomorrow? Help me because... That's our school! After searching parks, the police came to the Descartes middle school late this afternoon to question passers-by and students. Here, the hunt is still underway to find the animal spotted nearby after escaping from Orly Airport. Still no sign of the lion cub. The police advise against approaching... I have to call guys. Don't be afraid. - Where's your sister? - Where's Inès? She has stomach flu. Give it back. I'll film her when I get home! In cases like this one, our reserve can step in and offer it a natural environment again. Chief Customs Officer? What if it attacks someone? A child, say? It'll only attack if threatened. I don't think the customs service techniques are best suited to calm such an animal. Mrs Jannsen, you're 3,000 km away. Let us do our job, please. Once again, this is a wild animal. A dangerous animal. It's unvaccinated, so if you spot it, do not approach. Call the number at your disposal. It's dangerous. Do not approach. By the way, are you a boy or a girl? I get it. You're not a girl. What'll I call you? Paul? Bernard? Lucas, 11. Marion, 11. Malek, 11.5. Inès... I took my lunch break to... To see if you're better. I'm watching something on my laptop. About disappearing wildlife. They behead animals, gut them... It's horrible. - Can I come up? - No! You'd better not. I may be contagious. With your work, I don't want you to get sick. You're sure? Yes. If there's anything at all, call me, all right? I have to get back. What do you think of King? The bathroom. My brother's room. The grossest place ever. The stink is his shorts. Something died, I think. Where are you going? My parents' room. Well, my father's. Maybe not just his soon. Am I disturbing you? Sharpening your claws? Feel free. Her stuff's in the closet. Louise is nice enough but... I can't manage it. What? Are you hungry? This? Yeah, it didn't run much. This? You want a gnu. Sorry, but I've run out. And this? Want this? This stuff? I admit I'm not great with animals. Nor with humans. What? You want more? I'll be right back, ok. Inès? Where are you going? To do the shopping. I just did it. I got what you like. But your stomach... - Everything ok? - Great. For my brother. CUSTOMS That's it. I have your dinner. - Who let you in? - Why didn't you tell me? Everyone's looking for it. Get out. Hold on... We keep it. I mean, we can do loads of stuff with it. I dunno... A YouTube channel with something new each day. We could put it on a skateboard... Listen carefully. King stays with me alone. Keep away. Don't talk to him. If you tell anyone about him, I'll post you naked kissing an imaginary girlfriend. You never shot that. Get it? Do you? Yes, I get it. It's ok, King, it's over. It's over. It's ok. - Get lost. - She's nuts. My lion buddy. Seriously? Seriously? Cool buddy. Hugo! Come on. Hurry up! My mum. She died two years ago. My dad. When he's here. I'm abandoned too. But you found me. And, unfortunately, my brother. "If we auctioned King, I could make new friends." Louise. "I have to tell your dad. Even if he dumps his kids on me to save on a minder." And that's my grandfather. He's been all over the world. Maybe he even knew your grandparents. I'll check in on her tomorrow. Good news. No more trips. What? I'm the new deputy manager for logistics. I'll be home all the time. Seriously? How about you? - Are you doing ok? - Yes. What's that look? Huh? What look? - Are you managing? - Sure. It's just... not easy with your daughter. - Shall I talk to her? - No, don't. I'm getting my bearings. You know, she may seem weird from time to time but it's not you. I know that, but whenever I do something, I get it wrong. And when I say wrong, I mean totally wrong. So there comes a point when I think... I'm not sure I... She's in the wrong. Since losing her mother, she's been walled up. She's in her own world. Martin? Before returning them to the wild, our team readies these animals to discover their natural habitat. We're pleased with the results. The twelve big cats taken in this year have all acclimatized. Telinka, our latest resident, wouldn't leave his cage when he arrived last month. Now, he runs 30 km every day. 30 km a day? How can you do that? It's impossible. If I've got this right, you'd need to circle my room 10,000 times a day. It must be hell for you. I could take you out at night when people sleep. No, the neighbour's dog. I hate it. Got an idea? What? I take him back to Africa? I'm not in front of my computer. I'll call you later. Shit... Louise, I... I can't go to school. I feel bad.. Really? But... Do you want a doctor? Can I stay here to help Inès? My balls... Shit, you're nuts! Louise, it's a bit embarrassing... But I think I have my period. Really? - Want to talk about it? - It's ok. I talked to the other girls. I'm fine. King's way cute!! Any other photos? King! Let's go, they're after you. Inès? Can you come down here? We'll go to see my grandpa, 200 km away. He'll know what to do. - What's going on? - Open the door! Open up! Where are you going with my Space Killer? They'll arrest you in no time! 3 minutes. 3 minutes to wait. Can you breathe in there? The train from Paris to Troyes is arriving on platform C. Please stand back. What's going on? Where are they? No way... - Ma'am... - Have you seen two kids? A boy in glasses and a girl with black hair? - They've left? - I have photos. - They left with him? - Him? Who's him? Ok... We're here. In Orly. Grandpa lives here. And, after, we'll go here. Tickets, please! You jerk! Why are you here? Louise ratted on us. She makes me sick. Where's King? He isn't here. What? Hungry? I bet you are. Dextrose, sodium nitrite... - Want this? - Let me do it. Sorry about the video. Really. I'm sorry. I got carried along. Where're you going? Nowhere. What do you mean, nowhere? Where're you taking him? Africa? Yeah. You can't be serious! How'll you go? By train? We'll go to Max's first. Max? - Who's Max? - Mum's dad. - Our granddad. - The one we met twice? - The crook? - He isn't. He's in import-export. He's sent stuff around the world. He can help us. Help us do what? Go to Africa. Get it? You know you're nuts? She's nuts, right? Yeah, I know. Completely. Right, King? #mylionbuddy. - If they catch him... - They'll kill him! Yeah, they're real bastards. It'll take longer than planned. But that's a good thing. That way, we can talk a bit. It's ok, my battery's good. Ok? Lidl, Family Gear, the Mattress King, Bargains & Co... You won't see that in Africa. Beautiful, huh? This sucks. Yeah, France has changed. Put King in the bag. Right now. What? A man, 1.80 m, bald. He threatened me with a box-cutter. - He went that way? - Hurry! Come on, King. Time to go. Report of an armed man at the Romilly-sur-Seine railway station. What now? Max comes to fetch us? - No, we surprise him. - Surprise him? So he doesn't know. Hold on. We can let him out. Out you get, King. Is this the right way? Yeah. I hope he's had a tetanus shot. Actually, have I had my boosters? How can I tell? I check my health records? I think he has decided for us. We sleep here tonight. What? Want the last one? He ate the rest? Want it or not? I'm starving. You don't want any? Inès, is that normal? It means he's hungry. Tomorrow, we'll try to find a hen run. The trouble is, last time, he did it wrong. I had to help him finish what he'd started. I had a box-cutter. The hen was squealing. Don't give me that look. I was kidding, Alex. Great, we worry about you and that's how you thank us. It's ok, I'm good. I haven't felt this good in ages. Can I borrow your phone? Why? Aren't you scared of brain cancer? I want to send an email. To a reserve in Guinea. A woman there saves animals like King. Marie Jannsen. Marie Jannsen... - Shit, Louise! - Don't answer. What if she calls Dad or the cops? Please leave a message. Shit! Max Welzer... Why don't we go home? Go back if you want. But we can't. I'm cold. Here. Is it Mum's jacket? Yes. I thought it was bluer. Good night. Try to sleep a little, King. I already told you. I sent her an email. Better safe than sorry. Old folks' expression. Who says Johnson will reply? Jannsen. You see her on TV and she sends a plane for King? Is this it? Yeah. Curved lines, classical style... Max lives in a 19th-century château. Hello, Max, it's Inès and Alex... I can just imagine it. My skate park, my basketball court... How old is Max? He's old. At death's door? We inherit soon, like? I was right. Late 19th. Renaissance revival, English garden. See the facade's decorations? What are they called? King, wait for me! You climb trees now? Look! That's him. It's Max. It's Grandpa. That's a woman. Let's go, Clarisse. - You have to pack, Eric. - Right. I did all I could to support you with the management. Let's go. A lion cub... Yes, and two giraffes over there. Beautiful, aren't they? It's not Grandpa's home. It's his retirement home. Right, wait here for me with King. If he gets out, we'll lose him. You realize that? Yeah, don't worry, got it. Sorry, but there's no Welzer here. Did you spell it right? W-E-L-Z... E-R, yes. Look. Roberto is your grandfather? That's right. He never mentioned grandkids. He's pretty secretive. Clara, seen Roberto? No, sorry. Seen Roberto? Not today. Have you seen Roberto? Not since yoga. He said that stretching... Was easier in bed! Could we hurry, please? My parents gave me an hour. They're at the cathedral. Roberto, a visitor. Sorry to disturb you. I thought it was your home. That's ok, it is his home. Only Roberto can stay six months in arrears. The manager likes you, right? I used a false name here. How did you find me? No one knows I'm here. You don't wonder why I came? I do. I wonder why you came. So, why did you come? - Does your dad know? - No. I'm with my brother, Alex. He's outside. Max, I need your help. We have something precious. When you see it, you'll understand. Cash game in 109. You in? You bet I'm in. Coming? - Where? - Outside. Outside... It's ages since I was outside. I can't, with my medication. But here's fine. Time for your snack. Our snack. Best time of the day for me. Coming, Roberto? Please, Max. Go home, it's wiser. The guy with the lion is totally cute! The irresistible intellectual type. He's wanted too, which makes him even sexier. What do you think, girls? King? Start with room 107... What now? Plan B. What? Where's Max? No use. Back to the station. Train to Clermont, Marseille, Africa. No way. It's pouring, we have no cash. Let's go home. - 1,400 - What? 1,400? We have 1,400. - What? - I took his cash. Your phone. - Why? - To check train times! No, we go home! - Give it to me! - Let go! My phone! Come here! Calm down, this is a rest home. Are you crazy? Want your money or not? Roberto! Wait! - Here. - Where's the rest? When we arrive. Arrive where? I'm not going anywhere, ok? I have to be back this evening. It's a Mexican dinner with fajitas, guacamole and all that. I'm not missing my nachos. - What now? - We have a problem. What? Who's King? Our lion. What? He's our lion. A lion cub we found. He escaped from Orly. You're a fine storyteller. You have a great imagination. Kids with an imagination are wonderful. Alex, I can't wake him. Check my bag for the list of big cat vets. It's real. We need a vet fast. Ma'am, why are you here? Are they here? - I want to see them. - Wait! Tell me where they are. On the home's bus with your father. We'll find them. My father? He's a resident here. Roberto Stavini. No, he's their mother's father. His name's Welzer, Max Welzer. It'll be ok. I promise it'll be ok. I promise. That's it for today. We open again at 10 AM for an unforgettable day. Excuse me. I don't know how security works here, but it's poor. We found this. Take them to the infirmary. They're on their way. Not coming? I'll come, I'll catch up. I need to make a phone call. Give me my wallet. Come on. I need my papers. Go on or he'll have a stroke. Where did you find him? I don't know. When I left the park, I don't know... He's not one of ours. When did it start? This afternoon. Did he eat anything special? No, always the same thing. And that is? What did he eat? Sausages. Just like me. A shot of cortisone. A toxic reaction to his food. My fault? We'll see about that later. Are you ok? MISSING They fled with their grandfather, a certain Max Welzer, also known as Roberto Stavini. The children were last seen at the Lys rest home on board a Scania bus... Hi, Max. You're out and about. So you're alive. I'm glad to hear that. Maybe now you can refund the 353,754 euros you've owed me for a while. With interest. Call me. King? That's his name, right? I'm not exactly connected, but you're hard to miss. What? We're in the paper? What do you plan to do with him? Find him a home. Don't take it badly, but no one will take a trafficked animal. Without a chip, we can't tell if he's sick, or has been. I've found a reserve in Guinea. In Africa? Mind your head. I emailed Marie Jannsen. She'll reply. How'll you cross the Mediterranean? To reach a reserve across Africa, with an undocumented animal? In two months, he'll double in size and weight. In three months, this cute kitty will have blades instead of claws. He'll need up to five chickens a day and slaughter local pets. Even a tame lion remains a lion. After the lion eats the other animals, he'll need bigger ones. Then it gets dangerous. Understand? Know what they'll do if they catch him? Do you know that? No, I don't! Stay with me tonight. - All right? - Ok. Look! There, the return of the king. Marie Jannsen Dear Inès, I got... Yes, I know it's been a very long time. Françoise, I've often thought of us, I swear. It's true. I'm calling because I think I'm going to need you. Do you think you could put me up? For a day, a week, a month, I don't know. What? You saw me on TV? Don't believe everything you see. I don't even know those kids, I swear. Françoise, I don't have kids, so how could I have grandkids? It's obvious... Hello? It's great she replied, but you're not in Africa yet. The cops are in the park. Take the emergency stage exit. The show's starting, so hurry or I'll change my mind. What is it? What did you see? What is it? Tarzan! Stop that! Stop it! Are you ok? Witness the consecration of the mighty gladiator! Enter Grandi us, son of Brutus! Only his courage in the face of starving beasts can save him! The moment is here, commoners! Prepare to quake! Who are you? What do we do? No... Grab her! Security! - Take the wheel. - What? Take the wheel, ok! But I can't drive! It's accelerating on its own! I won't be in today. Take the file marked Lachmany. Yes, I, after K and before M. Hold on. I'll call you back. I don't believe it. - Faster! - I lied to you. I never won a video game race. Faster, ok? Which pedal is it? Ok, King? Olga the Canadian... I never did a thing with her. But I'd like to before I die, ok? I wanna be a man. I don't wanna die. It keeps accelerating! What do I do? One man injured. Injured? A Murmillo. A what? A gladiator with a big shield. The name comes... That'll do, thanks. - You'll get fired. - Why? No idea, but you really need to catch King. You bet I need to. But there are rules to follow, precautions to take. I know them all. If you're interested... - What's he doing there? - Who? - It's Max. - Just the guy we need. Keep driving! Sorry. I'm so happy to see you. Something amazing happened to me. It was incredible. I went back to the bus yesterday to fetch my phone... Tell us later, ok? Ok. But... Am I really welcome? Get in. Where're you going? The South. That's a bit vague. The South is big. St-Tropez? Monaco? Ramatuelle? A bit further south. What's up? Pass me. The cops? It's not the cops. Stop! Ignore her. Just ignore her! Inès! I know. No belt. Doctor's orders. - Stop. - No, don't. They don't want to talk to you. Stop, I told you! She seems to care. Alex! Shit! Is it serious? She's ok. Can someone tell me who that was? Our stepmother. She's not that bad. But Inès won't accept her. How will you get to Africa? We were counting on you. What? Me? No, you've got the wrong guy. I hate travelling. I'm a real stay-at-home. I get travel-sick and... No, it's not a good idea. See, I told you. I thought you'd always done that. On the move all the time. The only time you settled was when you went to Brazil in '79, abandoning Mum and Grandma. And your firm... Welzer International. Exporting luxury goods. Perfume, clothes, leather goods. You did it all from your armchair? Your mother told you all that? She rarely mentioned you. Forgive her. It's ok, Alex. It's not really a surprise. Your mother had reasons to hate me. I tried to be a good father, really. But we needed to eat. I couldn't... make money for the family and be with the family. But I called your mother every day. There. But she stopped speaking to me. Because I... She had quite a temperament. Like that animal of yours. So, will you help us or not? - I'll try to. - Great. We have a plan, but it's unusual. We reach the Med. It'll take centuries. What do you see? I see a bedside lamp on a flying carpet crashing into a helicopter. And then, behind it, an upside-down parrot eating popcorn. You know, King, I appear confident, but it's to give myself courage. I'm not saying we won't make it, but it's tougher than I expected. We'll make it. I promise. Honey, come and see. The lion cub injured an actor at the Vulcania Park. Clémence, what's the latest news? I'm here at the Vulcania Park and this incident has not dented the popularity of France's most famous lion whose images have had millions of shares, even in schoolyards where kids put their hands behind their heads in support of the animal. A chain of supporters has formed on social networks... Just a second, Martin. Hold on. Have you got a minute? Listen... It probably isn't serious, but... Inès and Alex are missing. Found anything? I've nowhere to hide. A rest home, well, a sea-water spa. Great. Will they need my records? No, I gave them Olivier Durand's. Who's Olivier Durand? Your role for the next month. But I trust you, Max Welzer, you'll do a great job. So what's his problem? Chronic depression. I can do chronic depression. One other thing... Can I get a room with a sea view? I'll call you back, ok? The sea? We go by boat? Where? Africa! We go by boat? By boat... Yes. Great. Where's King? I don't know. Seen King? He was with Max. Don't move! I'm coming! I'm here. There! Down there! - Is he dead? - No, he's breathing. He can't stay like this. Got what you need? - No, I... - You don't have your gear? I thought the procedure... You thought? There's a vet 10 km away. Ok, let's go. Listen, I'm sorry. I didn't know he'd wander off. I've never had a lion before. A dog, but not a lion. My dog, Poker, was a darling. She'd lick my neck... Spare us the life story. Leave me be. We'll find him. Get lost! #Save king #Mylionbuddy. Are you ok? One last thing, then we do what you want. A movie, pinball, anything. What's pinball? You don't know? I played throughout high school. I was an ace. You have to guide a metal ball using two tiny... Are you gonna kill King? He won't suffer. How do you know? Have you tried? Alex? Quick, get in! What's going on here? They're weird. My lion buddy. Ok, I screwed up. I tried to erase it, but it had already gone viral. Drop dead! I wish you'd drop dead! What are you doing? Stop! Stop! I'm really sorry. Don't move. Don't move an inch. - No way... - What? I'm outside the Alfred Fournier clinic where the animal was brought this afternoon. On social networks, many are protesting the fate that awaits him. Who leaked this? I want to know how it got out. We'll look like executioners. What? Louder, I can't hear. It works. I'm a genius! Yes. Shut up! Shit... Room 3. You'll find it. What's wrong? What is it? Does it hurt? Does it hurt? Just ignore it. Ignore the pain. I'll get you out. Don't move. Don't worry, it's nothing. I'm ok. Inès, be reasonable. Listen to me. I can't stay with you, all right? But I'm with you. Even if you can't see me, I'll always be with you. They'll put you to sleep. So you can leave in peace. Without suffering. You understand? King, tell me you understand. I'm sick of losing those I love. Please... Don't touch me! Let go of me! Let go of me! Let go of me! I'm sorry. Got a girlfriend? Yeah. Three years now. Three and a half even. What's her name? Mireille. Yeah. Her second name, no, her third. She's in here. Are you ok? I'm so glad to see you. Do you know where Alex is? - Is that why you're here? - No, of course not. You always have to do things for a reason. Right? Calm down. - What the hell? - Proud of me? - Proud of you? - C'mon, hurry. It's your father. Want to talk to him? Hello? Hold on a second. You're on your way here? Is he yours? I'm not moving. I'll stay right here. You see? There. Nice and easy. Everything's fine. I'm not scared, neither are you. This is a relationship based on trust. C'mon, hurry. Inès, it's me. It's me. Can we do this later? Ok, come on, move it! What's going on? Are you crazy? We're going to Africa. To take him home. But... Trust me. Inside, King's fate may now be settled. Look out! Help! Where's the boat? It's... I have the... Got a precise address? Of course I've got the precise address. Elisabeth? It's me. Max. You're alive? Listen, I'm calling to ask you for a favour. I have goods to ship. Look, I already told you I've had enough of your schemes. This is different. It's very unusual. Are you free for dinner? No, I'm afraid I'm busy this evening. I can try to cancel. It's just dinner with a girlfriend. Ok, I'm free. That's great. All right, I'll tell you all about it now. When's it for? Right away. Destination? Lagos, Djibouti, Dakar... Anywhere in Africa. Sorry, I've nothing this week. No, it has to be right now. Please. - Hold on. - What? I have a delay here. I have one this evening, leaving Sète at 5 PM. What're you shipping? I hope it's not heavy. Or illegal. What're you doing? Watching a film. Stop and put your belt on. Put it on! - Shit! - Watch out! Ok, kids, there's something I need to tell you. We share a cabin? I'm with Alex? I've no clean underwear. I need a toothbrush or my breath'll stink. King travels alone. What? None of us can go with him. We can't leave him alone. Calm down, ok. It takes two weeks. You can let your friend know. Who'll watch him? Who? Got another way? What now? We have how many lives? Dad, I was just thinking... - I was thinking... - Not now! It's true we have a communication problem right now. Look at me. - Listen. - Stop. Look at me when I speak. We can't leave things the way they are. - Hugo, shut up! - Dad! Which one is it? That one there, K9! Shit. Where is it? I don't get it. She swore it'd be here! Who swore? Who swore? An old friend. - A friend? - Yes. Way after your grandmother. She was a wonderful woman. I loved her so much. It was brief, but unbelievable. What are you saying? - What? - I can't hear. Is there a boat? Right now, no, but there should be. You lied to me, right? Don't give me that look. I swear I took care of it. This is Sète, dock K9. I don't get it. Why did I listen to you? Why did I trust you? Why? Why? Don't move. Stay there. King, stop! Move it! That'll get us to Africa? We'll see later, ok? Come on. How does this thing work? What do you want? You'll slow us down. I'll slow you down? They won't get far. Pass me the coastguard. Dad, no! Dad, don't do it! Stay in the car. Dad... You won't just have problems with me. Is this because of you? Let's say I took part. Sauvage! What the hell are you doing? Where are they? Tell me! Where are my children? Do you hear me? Out of the way! Stop the engine! Stop the engine! Let go of me! Hi, Martin. Louise, I think we've already met. Let me introduce Inès, Alex and King. The bastard! Sir, calm down! We'll arrest him. Go below. Let me through! Maniac! Are you ok? It works. Max, where are you? They're waiting, dock Q9. Dock Q9? Yes, Q9. They're leaving. Dock Q9? "Nirvana". Neither of you is Max? Right. He couldn't make it. He got held up. - Ok, bring the animal on board. - Wait. Show me your route before he boards your tub. My tub? It's up to you. We leave in 5 minutes. Why not his passport too? We need him. Shut up. He really is leaving. Let him leave. A boat this ancient has to be safe. I don't know him! He could sell King to anyone! We have to risk it! If he stays, we know what happens. Max was right. During the crossing, we'll sort it out with Marie. C'mon, King. Trust me for once. Let him go. I can't, Alex. I can't! Please. Get lost! - C'mon, King. - Let Mum go! Let Mum what? Let him go. Come on, King. Don't be afraid. It's going to be fine. I'm here. I'm with you. Forever. What'll you feed him on? We have 20 frozen chickens, or he can eat fish. Eat a couple of gazelles for me, ok? We're here! My buddy King! We'll come to see you, promise! Goodbye, King. After ten days, King reached Africa where the team from the reserve was waiting. No one trusts you! I don't know one person who does! As for my family, they had trouble finding their balance. But I trust them, they'll manage it. You abandon my kids and you expect me to trust you? Alex became a real star at school. But I keep his feet on the ground. King left Marie's reserve after a year there. He has been seen on the great plains with his own family. And if you want my advice, don't get too close. Subtitles by Ian Burley. Subtitling: HIVENTY
