HANDLE BREAKUP POSITIVELY Hello! Last year, I launched the "Breakup Winner Self-Healing Program". Over 120,000 people worldwide joined my courses in over 40 cities worldwide, which was a spectacular success. But now I think... healing after breakup is not the best. So, I will start my new program, which is the "Pre-breakup Healing Program." Today, we have a new brother who will share his experience with us. Hello everyone. My name is Yubao. I broke up because of a house rule: Eldest daughter must get married first. Or else bad luck will come. No way! That's what I thought. But then... Marry me! Kuen! Not only this... Marry me! Lynn! This is the result of not believing. I don't want to hurt anyone else, so I never go on a date again. The only way out is to wait until my sister gets married. You have my great sympathy. By the way, who is your sister? Well, she is a big shot! Good morning, Miss Yu. Morning, Miss Yu! Morning? You get paid for work not greeting everyone. You are fired. Off base! Drying nail polish in the office? It serves you right! - Morning, Miss Yu. - Morning. Is this design okay, Miss Yu? - Yes. - Thank you. Please check the document, Miss Yu. Okay, send it out. You got a meeting with publishers at 1:00, book signing at 2:30, tea with advertisers at 4:00. And the reporters arrived. It's all about your new book. You can dress up. They're ready for you. Okay. Pardon me. At 1:30... no, at 1:00 you've got to... Oh no! I forgot. - I'm the... - You're the director, right? You just listen to what I say later. Hello. I'm the host, Vivian. - Are you the famous writer, Miss Sheh Chu? - It's Yu. Oh really? They're spelt in a similar way. These are the seven questions I'll ask you. Please read them carefully. Then answer me shortly. Don't waste time. I have another job after that. And you're just promoting your book. - Director. - Yes, yes. - Do we shoot in high definition? - Yes. Good. I want a lighter makeup. - She is younger. Do it heavier. - What? Let's do it. It's hard to book her. Make up. - Yes, director? - Give her a HD makeup. - What's HD makeup? - It's... - It means heavier makeup for TV shows. - Got it. Hello everyone. Welcome to our show. Today we've invited the renowned writer, who is also an icon of independent women. She's publishing her new bestselling book: It's Not My Fault to Be Single Miss Yuchu, please! You're a supporter of singlism. So, what you think about marriage? I believe that marriage is not necessary. When we're footloose, we can work and travel whenever we want. It's so free! All your work is about being single. Is there no one picking you up? Why do I need that? I can pick up guys, if I want. It all depends on the gravity of earth. The gravitation pulls of the universe, and the harmony of yin and yang, simply put: fate. GUEST'S OPINIONS ARE HER OWN AND DO NOT EXPRESS THOSE OF THE SHOW Look at our sweetheart! She talks against marriage on TV again. But I'm worried about her getting married! She's so successful! - This is what happen to successful woman! - True. - She got her degree at 20. - Yeah, and at 26... she became a writer and lead editor. That's why she's stuck in the middle! The ones she likes don't like her, the ones she ignores like her. - As what Danny Chan said... - What? "Never say you're choosing one, anyone can choose you either." That's bad! What if she just keeps working... Hey, sis. Dad, mom. - You're back. - Dad, you're stronger. - And you look more handsome. - Look at your muscle. - And look at your face. - Just keep quiet. - Did you eat? Let me cook for you. - No, I need to work. - Alright. - Housekeeping for this month. Good girl. Limited edition Aviator, your best love. Awesome! I go to work first. By the way, I got my degree at 19 and a half. Keep your voice down if you're talking behind one's back. Sorry... let's talk in the chatroom tonight. My nickname is "Musculator." - Mine is "Messy hairs in the wind." - I have one too... - "Sexy Maggie." - What? - You're the "Sexy Maggie"? - You're the "Sexy Maggie"? - Let's eat hotpot after work. - Good idea! Let's go to Club Chocolate. The idea is rejected. Rethink. Get it done by tonight or nobody can leave! I have a meeting now. I'll be back by 11:30 with food. - Any suggestion? - McDonalds, right? No more fun. Karaoke dinner! I know one with great hot wings. We'll suffer if your sister is still an old maid. You find her a guy or it's not wing next time. - What will that be? - Chicken bottom. - I like chicken bottom. - Uncooked. SEARCH ABOUT 4,440 MILLION RESULTS OPEN UP THE LONELY HEART SEARCH I'm a lawyer, a doctor, an astronaut, - a director. - Liar. Are you lonely? Let me open up your heart. Opening up! Your heart! A psycho! I am a GCSE student who want to share my puppy love. Come on. Take it... What's up with you? Why are you singing? Are you happy? Yes! I'm really happy! I'm going to get married! Huan, didn't you vow to stay single? It's so happy to fall in love! And it's silly to be single! - Silly? - When love comes... You'll feel faint... and the whole world... turns upside down. "Turning upside down"? This guy can help your sister. Love therapist... Dick Cho? This is the happiest month I ever had for ten years. That's great! But this is the last class of the therapy. Time flies! You asked me to heal your broken heart. But you're all good now. You got the courage to love again. - But I... - Sheila... Look! You dress like a hag. Don't dress like this anymore. Come on. Look over there! Is there anyone you like? Oh no! You like fat and greasy things. Warm in winter, cool in summer. Not bad. But you shouldn't be a canary bird. But I only know how to be a canary bird. Canary bird... Canary bird... 1-2-3, 3-2-1, 1-2-3-4-5-6-7. Sheila, you're no longer a canary bird. You're a legendary woman who only wins in love. On the count of three, let's go and love hard. 1, 2, 3. Try to give him a big smile. This smile isn't good. You try a sunshine smile. The sun is beaming, rub some oil on him. That much? Not even enough for him! I'll leave it to you. Can I have a seat? Oil for you? Why not? DICK CHO LOVE THERAPIST I've heard about your case. May I know how much you charge? Generally, $30,000 to $50,000. It's reasonable. For you, I'll hang up if it's under $200,000. $200,000? Keep to the side... Dumbass! Keep to the side! One, two, three, four, the right side. Good. Time's up, Miss Yu. See you next time. Didn't you talk on the phone for 5 minutes? Yes, I forgot! Come on! Also, I don't think I've sweated enough. I heard there's an all-you-can-beat session like Love on a Diet. Sure, Miss Yu. Come on! You don't need to beat so hard. Hey! Hey! - I don't want to bargain. - You do make sense. - What's the therapy about? - I can't tell. It's a business secret! I can feel your vibes of a loser in love. Do you need my therapy? No. I've already given up! Wise up! I'll offer you the cheapest therapy to relight your passion for love. First, you need to find a right place. - What's the "right place"? - A place with more girls than guys. Any target? - Yes! - First, you must show a friendly smile. After your eye contact with her... you must speak in seven seconds. Don't get right in, if you can't get her attention. Let's go in from her side. The best angle is 45 degrees. Now go! - Pick up line. - What? - Pick up line. - Pick up line? Yes. Do you have asthma? Why are you gasping? Say something about your everyday life. I have constipation lately. Really? You need to take in more fiber or drink more water. They don't help at all! Mental effect? Are you stressed at work? Maybe. I need to get up early... What? Why are you talking to the guy? I'm not confident enough. 1-2-3, 3-2-1, 1-2-3-4-5-6-7. Yubao, you're no longer a loser in love. In the coming 1 minute... you're the coolest man in the world. You walk more stylish than Clark Gable! 1-2-3. Do you think I'm handsome? I think so! Which is the most handsome part? Every part I'll say. Let's take a look with light out in my place. Excuse me, this is my girlfriend. That's the way handsome guy live. You're so ugly, piss off! Siu Ming! Siu Keung! Not my face please! Beat him up except the face. - Body only? - Sir. Check, please. Leave it to him. Enough... Come in. Applicants for photographer are all here. Why do you wear top with so many pockets? Do you need them? - Photographers are like this, aren't they? - Mind your look. See you next time. Out of focus, poor framing. This is my style. What can you say about style when you have no skill? Get out! You should be impressed by my look and skill. True. But you don't have affinity. The longer I look at you, the more I want to give you a hard slap. We're short-staffed. You have one-month probation. He only comes for interview, not working. What?

This is not a high paid job. How can you raise your family? I'm single and I got two patents five years ago, which I can live on. I can focus on pursuing my dream now. When are you available?

The storeroom. - Thank you, Miss Yu. - Work hard and you'll be the manager soon. Apart from easygoing, you have great vision, too. Yes, quite great. So, what did you just ask? Well...

What did you do to her? Honestly... all those who need my help either got hurt by love, or have low confidence, or even given up love. I only open up their hearts and give them hope to love again. But you've opened up my sister's heart without closing it. Will she get hurt badly? Don't you remember phase six of my therapy? She'll heal up after it's done. Then she'll enjoy her new love.

It'll be a mess if you speak. - Exactly. - Don't worry! I have a great plan. - Good. - Whatever Mandy says, just nod and say "great". It's beautiful. Is the water show good? - Great! - Dinner yet? Great! - What did you have? - Great! - Are you feeling unwell? - Gr... Mandy, I'm a little claw without birds. - Do you mean you're a bird without claws? - That's what I said! After I met you, I... I feel like... a bird with claws coming out! It's not a bad joke. I'm serious. Love is actually very simple. If you like me, just look at me and I can see myself through your eyes. That's easy! Can you see yourself? What's wrong? Nothing... sand got in my eyes. Try again. Can you see yourself? There's nothing. Do you need me blow away the sand? Go ahead! That's even worse!

They have come afar, let's make it deluxe! Great! Your boyfriend is so wealthy, sweetheart. Picking us up with such a luxury car. Yes, sure. I'm going to be broke. - What? - What did you say? Nothing. I said it's worthwhile making you two happy! Wow! Such a big house! Welcome! Wow! So many maids! Wow! Mom, I don't see anything to "wow" about. I "wow" because I have a stomachache! - Take my mom to the toilet, please. - This way. Be careful. Good morning, sir. Good morning. Sweetheart. This is your handsome boyfriend? Everyone has their own taste! Nice to meet you, uncle! What're you doing? Are you bankrupting me? We said deluxe. I'm already doing this cheap! The maids are Springtime Productions. Wage only 50. Hey! By the way. How did you two meet? Yeah, how did we meet? Yeah! Do you remember? You lost your wallet and borrowed 500 from me. Yeah, that's how we met. You still owe me that 500 dollars! Then you should pay her back. A man should be trustworthy! - Yes... trustworthy! 500, right? - Right. I had breakfast on an empty stomach. - I'm hungry again. - No problem, sir. The premium bird's nest soup is ready. - Really? - Let's have it upstairs. $4000 for 50 grams. Check later! Dr. Cho, sis took our parents to see you. After I deal with your parents, I'll explain everything to your sister. Unfortunately, my move is failing! Or it'd be Phase 6 already! - Don't tell her I hired you. I'll be dead! - Don't worry. I'm a pro. I won't betray you unless it's necessary! The house is so big! I got lost after going to the loo. Stupid me! - Where am I... - Mom! - Bo! You're here! - Mom! - It's so good! This is Dick Cho, my sister's boyfriend. Hello, auntie. - Hello, Mr. Cho. - Hello... Mr. Cho, you're really... so handsome! Auntie, you're so beautiful too! Handsome guy! Handsome guy... Auntie, you're so... cute. Mom's away for so long. Where's she? - Sis! - Why're you here? Mom and dad called and told me - they're meeting Dick. I brought him here. - What? - Where's he? - Outside in the garden with mom. - Nice palm! Nice palm! - Mom! Sweetheart, your boyfriend is really a super handsome guy. You're also super beautiful. - Come over! Come over! - Okay. Come with me! - Let me tell... - Not now. I know everything! I'll deal with you later! Also, I know someone hired you to mess with me. I'll find out the culprit! And then? Chop him up into confetti! Are you embarrassed? Nothing... count on me. I'll find out everything! A man called L is acting as my boyfriend. He's with dad. You two keep acting, don't blow this! What are you guys so happily talking about? - Mom, have some tea. - Where's my husband? - He's eating upstairs. - I miss him. - I go find him. - No. I'll get him for you. - I'll go quick. - Sit down, mom. Have some tea. Really? Hey! Where's my wife? She's in the garden. I miss her. I go find her now. - No. I'll get her up here. - This premium! Premium! Taste good? - Dad! - Mom! Mom! - Where's my husband? - He's putting his up upstairs. Dad! - Where's my wife? - Showering. Chu said she's in the garden. - Yes, showering in the garden. - So tempting? - I miss him... No way. I must see him. - No... It's nasty there. I can't take it. - I miss her. I go find her. - No... Sit down and let her finish. Is your stomach fine? I'll give you a rub. She'll fall asleep during that. It's not good. He's here. It's okay... We're all family. My dad will fall asleep when getting a foot rub. Great... come on... It's okay. You don't need to take off my pants. - The inner sole. - You don't have to. Don't wake him up! Don't wake her up! Take her back to the hotel. Take him back to the hotel. Time for dinner! - Dinner time? - Dinner time? This way, please. Thank you. What should we do? Dad, mom! I bring a friend for dinner! Dad, mom! I bring a friend for dinner! Alright. - Dad, mom! I bring a friend for dinner! - Good boy... Dad, mom! I bring a friend for dinner! Drink a glass of "Jin Liu Fu", be together forever. Everybody, cheers. Cheers. Is this going to work? Yes! Dad thinks L is your boyfriend. Mom thinks Dick is your boyfriend. It'll be fine unless the cover gets blown! By the way... - when will you marry? - In two years. I want to work when I'm young. This young man is career-minded! How about you? When will you get married? Anytime. I am rich and I don't work. - This young man has so much personality! - Yes. - I told you it'll be fine! - Hey! - What if they call Dick's name? - That'd be bad! Hey, Dick! Does Chu bully you? Dick! You taught us not to speak while eating. That's right. How about this... Whoever talk from now on will be fined $500. Sound good? I agree! Dad, mom, have an early night in the hotel. Oh, Dick... Have fun till as late as you like. Don't come back too early! Hey, Dick... - Don't come in too early. Play crazily! - Dad, give me $20. Mom told us to do crazy things! Look! Dick, why is he kissing my daughter? Why do you call him Dick? He's Dick. Stop laughing! He's Dick! He's Dick! He's the real Dick! He's the real Dick! Dad, mom. Listen to me. - The truth is... - The truth is... They're twins. No wonder sis gets mix up! - What? - Twin brothers! You think I'm a dumb? Sweetheart, you can't be such a slut! - You have shamed the Yu family! - Don't go! Go after the show. Love triangle causes family tragedies! Falling out every day like soap operas! - Which one? - They're all the same! You two stop right here please. 1-2-3, 3-2-1, 1-2-3-4-5-6-7. Mr. and Mrs. Yu. I'm not your daughter's boyfriend. That "bastard" is her boyfriend. On the count of 3, that "bastard" is your daughter's boyfriend, Dick Cho. 1-2-3. Dick, Dick... You... take good care of my daughter. - You... whoever... good bye! - Good bye! - I didn't know your name for all night. - Dad, mom. Go and get some sleep... Let them say goodbye first. Goodbye. - Goodbye. - Goodbye. - Bye... - Don't go! I need to talk to you. Who's behind this? Sis, who cares about this? Let's just deal with him! You bastard! The one behind all of this, is him! Hey! Sis, I just want you to be happy. I'll call you. Chu, I'm in a difficult situation too. Wish you fortune and happiness. Bye. - This part is free. - Get lost! Don't leave, sleepover tonight! Sleepover? What do you want? I'm just trying to help. Look at you! How haggard are you! You'll... scare your parents if you go back! Just the two of us? How can I trust you? - Unless... - Unless what? ONE UNREAD EMAIL BOSS: DRAFT! THE DRAFT IS DUE ASAP! You think I'm scared? You will get it. STAYING SINGLE IS MY GOAL STAYING SINGLE IS MY PRIDE Miss Yu, please take on this swimsuit and sunbathe with master. Alright! Sexual harassment! I said swimsuit, not scuba diving. I can't even see your toes. So conservative! I won't let you take advantage! Your bill. Does it cost $100,000? Cars, villa, actors, crews., makeup, hair, costume, catering... - Everything costs. - But it won't cost $100,000! Look how happy your parents were, it's worth every penny! I'll go upstairs and write you a check. Hey... you want to run off again? I'll change into a leopard print T-back. Wait for your nosebleeds. No way! Ran off again! $100,000! A psycho! What? This is the 8th generation shark suit. Good-looking while keeping sweat inside. I can give you discount if you want. Not fooled? Dumbass! Damn it! The Single series already completed. - Marvelous! - Of course! You lot are still clapping? Do you want to get fired? Go to work! Dr. Cho! I've retired! I don't want to give up but need to remind myself. What are you laughing at? Is my singing bad? Why're you in HK? Mandy and her family came for business. - I came with them. - Why you came to me? I miss you! Now you've seen me. Wow! - A nice house! Why don't you let me in? - No. I've got guests! Just go. I know you like me! But I don't get it. Why are you like this? Why are you talking so much? Go! Someone asked me to tell Dick Cho: Mandy has a birthday party tomorrow. Just come if you're free. I'll see... tomorrow. Don't cry. Let go! I'm crying because I can't let go! That means you like her. Go tell her about your feelings! - Right. - I don't want her to get hurt! Young people are such chickens. Remember, love conquers all! Can love conquer all? Maybe? - That's what TV tells! - Yeah. Then I should go tomorrow? Do you need to chip in? I don't think so. - Then you must go! - Yes! Thunders and lightning. I'd better sleep with you two! Happy Birthday to Mandy! Happy Birthday, Mandy! Bro... I don't know what to say to Mandy. I'll be embarrassed with the crowd. There's nothing to be embarrassed. Tell your loved one the truth. Simply confess her your love. Okay. Go for it! You too! Mandy... - Who is he? - So loud! Excuse me, please go away. You're here. I wish you a happy birthday. I wanna tell you... I miss you so much! Mandy... I don't know what is love. But when you're with me, I'm so happy... When you're not with me... I feel so sad. I really miss you! I wake up two hours earlier to miss you. How does this sound? The lines are such clichés! But also from his heart! Do you... trust me? I'll hypnotize myself and show you. 1-2-3, 3-2-1, 1-2-3-4-5-6-7. Dick Cho. On the count of three, you're no longer a love therapist. You only love Mandy in your life. Never lie to her. On the count of three... You, Dick Cho, belongs to Mandy forever. 1... 2... You don't need to hypnotize to love me. Look at me! Tell me if you love me wholeheartedly. Mandy, I love you with all my heart! Why did you... come today? To tell my love how I feel. That's it! It's half an hour already but you didn't say a word. - If there's nothing, I'll go! - I... I want to say... Jane! Jane! Jane! Jane! I miss you so much! Then why didn't you find me? I don't want you to get hurt. If my sis is unmarried, bad luck will come to you. It's dangerous! So, you're not scared now? I... I'm scared! Listen to me! No matter how hard it is, if you want to, we can overcome every obstacle! Can love really conquer all? Yes, love can conquer all! - Are you okay? - I'm good. And you? I'm fine! Love... can really conquer all. Love can really conquer all!! Ouch! I wonder how Mandy's doing. Let's go. Jane, I'll be with you no matter what. What's that sound? You two are so smart, quick learners. Let's bet $100 per game. Not too much. Alright. This is yours. You're here... to collect my debt? He's not here for your debt! He teaches us play "Fight the Landlord". - Yes... he's the Landlord in this round. - Let's start! "The Plane" first. Beat that? - No. - No. Ace full house next, beat that? - No. - No. Three of a kind with 4, beat that? - If not, then I win. - What? - Honey, do you have any? - What next? - Do you? - So, what is this? Is it the "Bomb"? - Yes. - Bomb him! - Then I'll bomb him. - You go. The first bomb! If yours is a bomb, then this is too! The second bomb! The second bomb! I also have, the third bomb! Four of a kind again? This is... The forth bomb! The forth bomb! And the fifth! So... so many bombs? One more to go! The sixth bomb! The sixth bomb! - How about playing a single card for you? - Great! - This is the highest rank! - Now you mention it... Are these two the highest? Yes, they are! Then that's it! - We win? - We win! - We each get $100! - We've won $100... Not only this. Seven bombs mean... $12,800 each! - What? $12,800 each! - What? $12,800 each! I need to go now. We'll play next time. - Great... - $12,800... Hey... - Hey... - This is yours. That mahjong box looks familiar. It's your dad's. After the bank run... Yes. I don't trust the banks anymore. I took out all my money and put it in that box, then stuffed it under the bed. So why did you let him take it away? - He bought us some stocks. - Yes. - How much did you buy? - One million. You bastards! I only owed you $100,000. You got scammed for 1 million! Hey! Hey! The number you dial does not exist. Does not exist? Conman... Conman... Conman! The patient suffered a heavy blow. Her look may be changed. Be prepared! Jane! Jane... say something! Jane! Jane... Doctor, is this stocking for reshaping her face? No. Sorry. I mixed up! This is a bank robber injured during a robbery. The cops said the stocking is the evidence and can't be removed. She's next door. JANE XIAO This is your girlfriend. Okay! Jane? Doctor, how come? God's will, maybe! Not everything can be explained! But why has she got makeup on? I was a beautician before. It's a habit. - But how can she look like this? - You're not satisfied? - I can undo it! - No... - Okay? I'm leaving! - Thank you very much, doctor. What's it? You don't like how I look now? Jane, I'll always remember how beautiful you looked! I'll somehow bear this face. BROAD SHARP I have a news! The company is going down! So, I made a wise decision... Jumping ship! The new boss will be here soon. I'm fired. So, you all may well be fired too. That's all! Hope we'll meet again. Bye. What should we do...? Calm down, calm down. It's all yours! You scum! Why take it out on my family? Why did you scam my parents? I can pay you back. Listen to me first. Everybody. I'm the boss of "Happy Online" and your new boss. You can call me L. Don't worry. We won't close down for now. The company's structure is the same. Your salary will increase by 20 percent. Awesome! Except for her! Yuchu's Single series, from the second to the seventh one, meal included, sold less than 70 copies in HK. I've read them all. It's all about hatred, revenge, pessimistic life views, poor love values. They are just pure... evil! What the hell! Putting me down in front of all. You want a fight! Let me finish first. But... the special issue at Qiandao Lake is really top notch! She uses an innovative way, blending two love stories take place at Qiandao Lake to describe the customs of the place. Brilliant! So, I decide to put it on "Happy Online". I believe this new add-on will be a bestseller. The happiest news is, I've just received a report. The first issue has an order of two million copies, making the company rise from the dead! - Wow! - Good job, Miss Yu! - Actually, this book... - Let me finish. The most impressive is that she reviewed the "Love's like a Tide" made by her love rival. She could even praise it sincerely. She does have conscience! So, the boss has to come and say thank you. Thank you very much, Miss Yu. No problem. - My daughter. - Your girlfriend? - My daughter. - Impossible. She's beautiful! Just like her dad. Dude, you dare hypnotize yourself to fight for Mandy's heart. It shows your love is true. Now you know what's love. Let water go under the bridge. Be good to Mandy, or you'll get fired. Got it. Yes, be nice to her! Just shut it. You're evil and dictatorial. - A control freak. - Hey! - Enough! - Listen first. For all those cons and many more... I like them all! I liked them for a long time! Because I am your real fan! - What're you doing? - Will you marry me? - Where's your wife? - She ran away with another guy! So, I worked so hard... until I met you. Say yes, let me be the happiest man in the world! Hey, why did you scam my parents? He didn't! The stocks he bought us which cost one cent, has now rises to $7.8! We're rich! Sis, say yes! Let me get on with my life! He works hard and loves your family. Loyal, handsome, sexy with smooth skin and wear glasses. - Worth a try! - Actually, you two... - are a perfect match! - Really? Look at him. You can tell... he listens to his wife! Yes! Just as I do. The diamond is small! I knew that! I can compromise! What? She means "yes"! Are you okay? My knees are a bit weak. - We're here to share the happiness. - Yes. Guests of the day: Tom Hanks, Tom Cruise, Julia Roberts... - Really? - Really! - But they took the wrong flight to Russia. - Damn. Never mind. They're there. You're a groom again? - Great. Congratulations! - Thank you. Your bird's nest hairstyle is so cool. Thank you, thank you. - Congratulations! - Mr. Yen! Thank you. - Thank you. - Congratulations. Congratulations, boss. A big boy now. - Who's that guy? He's so passionate. - Is it... what Yen? Bhutan! Yeah, why didn't we get marry in Bhutan? - Qiandao Lake is better! - Wherever! Exactly! - Congratulations! - Thank you! Happy together Good luck forever Everyday... ...is better Happy Chinese New Year! I have a gift for you. It'll break the rules. Rules are dead. I broke up because of my house rule. The elderly... We do this because I forgot the lines... Creativity is infinite. Imagination but... All right! You fire her! I can't help laughing... Director, what are we shooting later? Sorry... Lobster soup, borscht set. Her buckteeth got your face. Sorry... Don't look like this. - Marry me, Yuchu! - What? Why are you doing this? Let me be the happiest men in the world. Why are you scamming my parents? Why do you need to do this? I become Ronald Cheung. Cheer up! Camera checked. Ouch! Flashlight... Go! I don't get it. Why are you like that? You're talking too much... ...can conquer all! The glass didn't break. Oh gosh! Your first issue of Yunan Dali travel magazine... I know she must laugh at it. You... I can't help laughing... How can he say that? We can go to Yunan Dali? - Yes, that's right. - How come? B: refined, C: ...refined Get the proposal done by tonight... - Look! - Hey, Dick... - Why are you kissing my daughter? - Why is he Dick? - What? - Why are you laughing?
