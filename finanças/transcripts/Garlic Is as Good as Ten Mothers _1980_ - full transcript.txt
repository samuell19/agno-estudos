He'd bring the fish, we'd boil the fish or we'd bake the fish... or we'd make a stew with the fish. We had to put garlic. In everything Mama cooked, garlic. This was an Italian lady and she always cooked with garlic. And I noticed that, uh... they never did have any blood pressure problems, no heart attacks.

So here, all of a sudden, was Berkeley... with this flowering of interest in gourmet cooking. Here was Berkeley in the late '60s and early '70s... into this whole alternative medicine trip... this anti—chemical medicine thing. Here was Berkeley into... small independent production... of vegetables... non herbicides, non pesticides, et cetera... and all of a sudden I found myself in the middle of it. So all of a sudden garlic became something that triggered my imagination. It couldn't have been any other food. That's the amazing thing about garlic. No other food would sustain the kind of interest that I had... and I was amazed to find how many people... and how many institutions... were finding in garlic something worthy of cult proportion. And so, I'm a victim of garlic. [ Man ] Can I ask you, in Nosferatu... how come there was no mention of or allusion to garlic? [ Werner Herzog ] It's part of the -the vampire mythology. I must confess I have never thought about it. But the film deviates from the genre anyway to some extent. For example, the vampire is, uh... a very sympathetic human being... a being who tries to be - to participate in human things... like death or love or other things. But you are right. There is a lot of references in Bram Stoker's novel... about garlic. Why do you ask this question? [ Man ] I wasn't just joking about vampires. I think there are vampires. They don't suck blood though. That's just a metaphor. They, uh - They suck energy. They're like little vacuums of chill... and you can - They- Well, for instance, there was one guy, I'm sure he's practically a registered vampire. He was a 17th—century Chinese food snob named Lee Lee—Wung... and his specialty was really bland dishes... and disapproving of anything with a very pronounced flavor, very strong flavor. His idea of a real fancy dish was plain boiled rice. Like, you know, almost like rice porridge. And the only flavoring was dew collected from flowers. And this could only be like wild roses. Garden roses didn't count. They weren't any good. And this guy made a point, boasted of the fact that he never ate onions or garlic. And he only ate the tips of chives. I think we have strict - This is historical evidence of a vampire right there. Can you imagine - Can you imagine having dinner with this guy?

On one occasion, when the garlic supply ran low... people refused to work. This may have been the first recorded strike in history. Wild varieties of garlic are found throughout the world.

Nonetheless, dogs and cats like garlic so much... that many brands of pet food... contain dehydrated garlic. [ Man ] How come you use garlic salt instead of real garlic... in the stuff you cook? Because it's easier. It's easier than having to peel garlic. Cheaper too. Doesn't it change the way the food tastes? No, it sure doesn't. It doesn't change the taste. But you know, like, it's modern times. You like the easiest way out, huh? If you're only gonna peel a couple of cloves of garlic... it doesn't matter how you peel 'em. But if you're gonna have to peel 40 cloves of garlic for a 40—clove chicken... or if you're gonna make a lot of garlic bread and you need a lot of garlic... uh, the faster methods of peeling garlic are definitely superior. Um, I mean, once you get into this... you can peel garlic fast enough... that you don't need to use instant garlic.

Garlic will come to you already peeled... in little cellophane strips. All you do is break the seal and pop out the clove. You're going to find new techniques in processing... where they can create a dehydrated product that you can rehydrate... and it will be very close to the real thing. I like to think that the other force will win out and that is... independent, small growers of garlic... along with larger growers who are aware that people still want to eat real food... and that the fun of garlic is in the peeling of the clove.
