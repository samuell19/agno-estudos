Hey, Amigo! Si, señor! Run, boys, run. Here we go. Hola, Caribbean center, this is Citation November 3 niner 8 Charlie Juliet request IFR clearance to San Juan direct Opa Loca. Roger that. Have a safe trip. Dan. . . good job! Thanks. The folks at Empire Mortgage are gonna be really happy about this. We'll wire the money to your account. Great. Got another job for you... a Lear down in Haiti. Haiti? I don't know, Joey. I think I'm gonna pass on this one. The repo business has kinda lost it's charm for me. Hello, Dan. What do you want, Tony? I need your help. I don't see that happening. Just listen to me. Like you listened to me after the crash? Did you ever think about how I felt? Hum? Did you ever ask? Mark was my best friend. You were like a father to me. You testified against me, Tony. I haven't had a legitimate flying job since. All you cared about was puttin' the blame on me. You were in the left seat, Dan... pilot in command. That wasn't the whole story, and you know it. What can I say? Losing a son does things to a man. What do you want? It's Ann. She's in trouble. Her missionary group has pulled out of a small village in Columbia. She refused to leave. Narco terrorists connected with Al Qaeda control the entire area. It's dangerous, Dan, it's very dangerous. I've talked to her on the radio. I've begged her to leave. I can't lose another child! Well, what do you want me to do about it? She'll listen to you, Dan, she loved you. That was four years ago. We haven't even spoken since! Just try! She won't listen to me. Sorry. These people answer to a higher power than you. A higher power... I too answer to higher powers! They will answer to me. Haven't you given them enough misery? It is you who have filled their heads with fantasies... fantasies about heaven and about hell. Maybe it would be better for them if it was you who left. If you have any decency at all, you'll return these men to their families and leave us alone. Decency? You make me laugh. I am beginning to lose my patience with you. This village will grow my crop. . .or else. Vamanos! I can't lose another child! She'll listen to you, Dan. She loved you. Just try! I'm glad you decided to call. I was surprised. What made you change your mind? You know what. What's this? That's my stuff, I'm going with you. Oh no, you're not. I agreed to go down there and get her, and bring her back, but not with you! I know where she is. I can read a chart. You're not going to help me in the jungle with a wheelchair. Just find her and bring her back, and the plane is yours! Thanks. Tony. . .I would have done it for nothin', but thanks! Hey! Does anybody speak English around here? Yes, señor. Who can I talk to about getting fuel for my buggy there? I have the best fuel in the jungle. Good. Can you top it off with jet A? Yes. Where is it you're headed, señor? Right there. Alto Risco. Not a good place to visit, sir. It's a troubled time down there. General Salazar, he's a local warlord. He forces the villagers to grow and harvest his drugs. Not good. It is a very bad time down there. Got some food in there? Yes! We have the best cook in all Santa Rita! My wife! C'mon. Excuse me, buen probecho. I hear you are going to Alto Risco? Yeah. . .I am. Excellent! This is a blessing! Why? I will go with you! I don't think so. I am sorry. My apologies! I am Mateo Barrero! Dr. Mateo Nestor Palacio Lugo Abraham Concepcion, the Second. That's a long name. I'm Dan. Well, you know, down here we use both our father's and mother's name. I guess in my case, both their parents also. Fascinating. As you see, I am a medical doctor. Well uh, I can't take anybody. But it was nice to meet you, Doc. You're going to need somebody. I mean, It's a very hard place to find. And I know Alto Risco very well. You've been there? Of course, that's my work! I go to all the villages. How's the landing strip? It's grass. Oh, there's another doctor down there, a missionary doctor, female... do you know her... Ann Williams? Annie! Yes! We went to med school together. All right! The shipment has arrived! They bring medical supplies and equipment and we are opening a new hospital for the region. A great blessing to all the people. And you could be a great blessing to me and to Alto Risco. Me? Nice to meet you, Doc. Your plane? More or less. It's Nice. Thanks. Jim Butler. All right, Dan Hogan. Where ya headed? Alto Risco, you ever land there? No, no... I've flown over it. It's a tiny speck in the middle of a very dense, green jungle. That's what I heard. Jim! Doc! How you doin'? Great to see you. Good to see you. Listen, we brought you down some supplies. Where's the chopper... We'll help you load it? Out of commission. How are you going to deliver supplies? I've asked Dan to take me. Hey, I would have asked Jim, but his plane is too large for the runway. Well, it's a win-win situation. Take the Doc, He'll show you the way. Thanks. Oh, and Dan, when you get back, we're always looking for a good pilot for a worthy cause. Great...already got a cause. Doc, good to see you. Be here at dawn. Good morning. What is this? Medical supplies for Annie's village. Gift-wrapped medical supplies? Operation Christmas Child. These are presents for the kids. What... I'm Santa Claus now? Come on, let's load up and go, alright. Be sure to strap and net the cargo. It's wonderful, you know, for days I had no idea how I could get the villagers their shipment... no clue! And I prayed and God was so faithful. You're a, you're a gift from heaven, Dan. God sent you! And you will be rewarded for your kindness, my friend. When you see those children get their presents, open those boxes, God will honor your generosity. Mateo, you want to know how to honor my generosity? Absolutely! Anything you say, Dan. Anything and I'll be glad! Zip it! I am joyous! Dan, we must look up to God. Up to God. Which way is up? Okay. . .stop it! Okay, okay. You like this? Oh. . .my. All right, I get it. Do you? Yeah, it was very funny, Dan. Where's that map? What's that smoke? That's Salazar. He's a thug... even has his own army and terrorizes everybody. He controls all the villages in the region. It's so hard to love such an enemy. Why do you keep coming back here? Must be a safer place for you to do your missionary thing. Daniel, my safety is of no concern. There is no better place to be than in the center of God's will. Unless it's in his presence. Wait! Look ahead! That's it! We're here! Uh, you call that a landing strip? He brought us here safely! Not so fast, we're not on the ground yet. Let me see if I can land this baby. We're lined up. . . 85 knots, 80, 75. . . touchdown! Mateo! Annie! Thank God! I'm so glad to see you! So good to see you too! Are you okay? I'm ok. What happened here? Salazar... He burned the church and the clinic and took the young men to work his fields. So why didn't you call us? He destroyed the radio. We're going to be OK. Dan?! You're the last person in the world I expected to see... what are you doing here? I came for you. Dad sent you, didn't he? He asked me to come find you and bring you back. I told Dad I wasn't leaving, and sending you isn't going to change that. What are you doing? Hum? I mean, this is crazy... take a look around! Dan, I'm a Doctor. These people need me. I'm committed to them whether it's safe or not. I'm sure you are, but they pulled out all the other missionaries for good reason... because it's dangerous! Yes it is...and with that plane out there Salazar has a good reason to come back. Right! So we unload and fly out right now! Without me. Annie. . .you're in the middle of a war! Don't you get it?! I'm it! I'm the last flight out! Dan, I'm not leaving these people. Annie, there's no time. We're going home. You're not committing suicide on my. . . Hey there. Sorry, they're pretty protective of me. Okay, let me see. Ow, ooo. Follow my finger with your eyes. OK stop, you're making me dizzy. So how's the patient, doctor? I think he's gonna make it. That's great! And I have wonderful news for you! The Chief forgives you! Forgives me! For what?! For forcing him to hit you with a club. That's big of him. Now that I've explained to the Chief who you are, he wants to ask for your forgiveness. No no, I'm okay. Forget it. Just go out and let him apologize. Why doesn't the Chief come in here? It happened in public, so it needs to be a public apology. It's tradition. No! I don't want to do it! All right? Absolutely not! Hey Chief. We have lost much to violent men. I saw you as a man of violence. I was wrong, I now see you as a friend. Forgive me for seeing you through my former eyes of darkness. Ah! I accept your apologies, Chief. Ah, you were also at fault. You manhandled me. You have to apologize too. It's tradition. Wait a minute...he hit me in the head with a bat. Tell him no. Dan. . . What did you say? Well, the Chief forgives you. He forgives me? I didn't apologize. Of course you did. And the Chief has a gift for you. A gift? No, I don't need a gift. Dan, you have to accept the gift. It's. . . It's tradition... I know. I'm starting to see a pattern here, Chief. Uh. . . what is this, Annie. . .chicken? Kind of. Kind of? Snake. Oh, snake! Umm. Nice! They learn that in English. What's with that little boy? That's Raimundo. He doesn't speak. His father was killed when Salazar fire-bombed the clinic. A few days later, his mother stepped on a land mine. I tried to save her, but. . . A land mine? Salazar mined the field. Excuse me. Mateo, do you have a lollipop? I sure do. You know, that song was written by a former slave trader, John Newton. A vile man whose life was transformed by God, and God saw it to put in his heart such beautiful music. Thanks Dan, be careful! This is the area they mined. Mined?! Why would they mine a church? To keep us out. They don't realize God is in our hearts, not in a building. Why are you in this godforsaken place? It's not "God forsaken". I'm sorry Dad got you into this. Why did you leave? God called me. You ran away. Plain and simple. No, that's not true! It is true. No it's not! After the accident our lives took different directions. Everything changed, you're right. Yes it did...it made me start asking a lot of questions. And this is the answer? I found the answer in God's love and his forgiveness. How can you have faith in something you can't see? Faith is trust in the unseen. And you believe that? Yes I do. Dan, you have faith that the air rushing over your wing will create lift so you can fly. You have faith in something you can't see. Maybe I do. Hah! Gotcha! That is not how you do it. You show them. Show them how you do it...the right way. You know, you make the kids laugh... it's beautiful, it's great. Uh, what about that guy? Go to him. Oh, I know how it is to lose someone you love. And someone you think. . . you can never live without. I'm going to check on the plane. You want to take a walk? Sure. Annie, you have to understand if you if you stay here, you could die, you and your people. I know and it's getting even more dangerous. I thought about going to another village, but the closest one is 30 miles across the mountains. And to take everyone across Salazar's turf. . . Well, let me fly you out of here right now. We can take all the kids, some of the women. Some of the women? What about the ones left behind? We can't take them all. We'll send a helicopter for the rest of them. That might work Dan, but I'm not leaving until everyone's safe. You never change, do you? Mateo, you scared me to death. They're back, the soldiers are in the village. I think they're just looking around. If they saw the plane they're just looking around for me. We've got to get back to the village. Follow me. I'll meet you at the village. Where are you going. To check on the plane. Be careful, Dan. Everyone all right? Yeah. Everybody? Everybody's okay. You're right, Dan, we have to leave this village, I'll go talk to Chief Juan. The Chief! Why is this taking so long? Dan, relax. The Chief will make the right decision. I am praying for God to give him wisdom. Well? The Chief has decided that we'll leave. Atta boy, Chief! The whole village...everybody. That's ridiculous! We can't get all these people into the plane. We can if you take the seats out. We'll be overweight. We'll never get off the ground. I'm not going to leave these people here. I can't leave you here. Then it's settled. We'll all go together. You gotta have faith, Dan. It's gonna take more than faith. There are two soldiers guarding the plane right now. I know the feeling, pal. Hello! I'm a, I'm a peaceful man. I would not harm you. I said I wouldn't harm him. I didn't say anything about you. No, you didn't. How many villagers are there? Twenty-five, excluding us. I'll need to know their weight. I can figure that out for you. All right! You did well, my friend. Everybody's going to fit. Good. Are they ready? Yeah, just about. I can't believe we're takin' everybody. We're gonna be overweight. We've to get out of here... now! You're the answer to my prayers, Dan! What? I bet you never thought you'd hear me say that, huh? Raimundo! Stay there, I'm coming for you. Be careful. Easy. . . Hold on! It's okay. . .it's okay. I'm almost there. Okay. You all right? Hold on tight! Okay? God is like a loving shepherd who takes care of 100 sheep. And when one wanders away and gets into trouble, what do you think he does? I don't know. Dan, what would you do if you were the shepherd and one of your sheep wanders away? I don't know, I guess I'd write it off. Ah. But fortunately, God never "writes us off!" Jesus would search until he found the missing sheep and restore it to the flock! You are a great blessing, my friend, like a good shepherd, you have rescued a lost sheep. What are you doing? I'm draining the fuel. Yeah, I can see that. Why? To make the plane lighter. I sure hope you don't drain too much. Me too. You're actually worried we're not going to make it. We're 800 pounds overweight! So, this is a big plane, is that too much? The last time I flew an overloaded plane, it crashed, killed my best friend, Mark, Annie's brother. I'm sorry. I'm sorry too. It is clear, my friend, that the Lord brought you all the way here for a reason. Rapido! You okay? Yeah... You? Oh, Rosa! Is she gonna be okay? She'll be okay. Oh, no! Come on. . .keep it together. We're gonna make it. Sure, what are we going to do? Go up to Salazar and say give us our plane back? Hey... I'm the cynical one, remember? I'm just. . . I've got an idea. I'll be right back. Where are you going? Just keep them quite. Doctor Williams. I want to thank you for the airplane. It's a very nice gift. But, it is no good to me without a pilot. You see, I cannot fly it myself. I am here to offer you help, safety, but first you must come forward with the pilot. You cannot hide in the jungle forever. This is your last warning! We will find you. Come out now. Do it for the villagers' sake! Think about it. Hurry! We just lost our cover. Is everyone in? Except Mateo. I don't know where Mateo is. We can't wait any longer. We've got to go! Close the door! Come on, come on! No good! We're too heavy! Now what? Without a headwind, we'll never make it. You see? Even the winds obey him. Hang on! Mateo! Please, Lord! Oh!!! C'mon, rotate! Come on! Come on! Come on...climb!! We're not gonna make it! Have some faith, Dan. No!! That was a miracle. It was probably just physics. Mateo...What about Mateo? I saw him jump from the truck. After that. . . You're hit! It's okay, I'll be all right. Let me get these... easy. . . easy. Hey. . .how you doin'? Fine. . . I'll be fine as soon as we land. We should be coming up on Santa Rita soon. Hey, we got 'em packed in like sardines. Who do you have with you? We've got the whole village. The whole village? How did you get 'em off the ground? Well, there's a difference of opinion about that. And we're going to need an ambulance. Can do. Roger that. We're almost there. We made it! Yeah.. . .everyone but Mateo. Hmm. How you doin'? Hey. . .I'm fine. Thank you so much. Better get some rest. Hmm. Hmm! You all right? Yeah. No, I am not. Look, you did good out there. I've gotta go. Where? There's a sheep still missing. Ann said he was probably killed. Yeah, probably. Then why would you want to go back? What if he's alive? You got a plan? Yeah. Fly to Alto Risco, get Mateo, and come back. Simple enough...count me in! Good. When did they fix this? Who said it was fixed? Oh, great! Okay, so explain the part about how we find him. We take a low pass, see if we can spot him. Uh-huh! Okay, let's jump ahead then. If we find him, how're we gonna to get him out? I'm not sure about that yet. I bet you were the kind of guy who did his homework the night before it was due, huh? Nope! Did it on the way to school! What's that? This? My homework. Fly in from the west. They won't expect anything coming from that direction. Gotcha! There he is! He's alive!! I can't set down here. Head him over to the airstrip. Come in low and fast, Jim. When you flare, I'll bail. Orbit out of range, I'll call you when I need you. Low and fast it'll be. Right. My friend, you came back. I prayed and God sent you. You look good, amigo. I was trying to blend in. It worked! Well, they couldn't find me. Jim, we need you now! Now! Roger that. On the way. This way! What are you going to do? Turn in my homework! Aaaahhh! I've been hit!! Mateo!! Go, go, go! My God is ever faithful to me, you know? He delivered me from my enemies. He has. You know. . . Save it. . . save your strength. I think it's time that I go home now. Yeah. . .that's why I came back. No, my home... home is with the Lord. . . I think that it is his will that I go there now. There is no better place to be than in the center of God's will. Unless it's in his presence. He's home now. He knew. He filed his flight plan with heaven a long time ago. That's where he is now. I don't. . .how he could be so sure? Christians believe that the Bible is God's standard and it says "For God so loved the world that He gave His only begotten Son and whoever believes in Him shall not parish but have everlasting life." That Promise is what gave Mateo peace. I want to have that peace, you know, that confidence. You know, Dan, I was a preacher's kid and thought I was entitled to a free ride to heaven. But the whole time I was headed in the wrong direction. The hard part for me was realizing I was lost. When I did, the thought of me spending an eternity in hell, well, it terrified me. See, Jesus came that we might have life and have it more abundantly. He came, he bled, he died on the cross and arose from the dead, and he shed his blood for my sin... for all sin. And when I realized that, I was overwhelmed by that kind of love. So I asked the Lord to forgive me and that He would accept me, by His grace. And now I'm saved. I still don't know how. That's okay, just pray. Pray? Me? I wouldn't know where to start. Prayer is simply talking to God. The words aren't as important as the attitude of the heart. Dear God. . . I've been lost a long time. Too long. . . like one of those sheep. Forgive me, Lord, for. . .my life, everything I've done. . . my sins. Accept me, oh Lord, as I give my life to you. In the name of Jesus Christ. . . let me walk in his ways. Amen. You made it! And Mateo? He didn't. I don't know how Annie is going to take this. Dan, I had no idea it would come to this. I don't think anyone did. But I'm grateful that you are all right and that you brought my daughter back. I'm glad you're here, Tony. She needs you. Let's change the dressing and we'll pull the IV. And you are out of here in the morning. In the meantime, I think there's somebody that wants to see you. Hi! Dad. You're here! I can't believe you came. Well, I. . . I should have come a lot sooner. I should have left when you wanted me to. I'm so sorry. I should've listened. If anything has happened to Dan or Mateo, it's my fault. No, you did what you thought was best. So you've got to stop blaming yourself. I've been doing that since the accident. it almost destroyed us all. If you hadn't sent Dan, I don't know what would have happened. Dan loves you, I knew he'd take care of you. He brought all of us out, the whole village. So much has happened. My good friend, Mateo, he stayed behind, and he risked his life to save us. Dan went to try to find him. I know. Dan's back, and he wants to see you. Hey. Mateo? Did you find him? We found him. He was shot gettin' away. I'm sorry, honey. He died in my arms, Annie. What? He said, it was time for him to go home. What's happened here in the last few days epitomizes that greater love has no one than this... that a man would lay down his life for a friend. The Bible tells us that its appointed to every man once to die and after this, the judgement. Well, Mateo, he's kept his appointment with death and eternity. Right now he's enjoying his reward with God in heaven. And so we're here to dedicate this hospital. And we do it in the honor of our good friend, Mateo, and to the glory of our great God! Amen. Amen. I've been looking for you two. I've got some good news. I just got off the phone with my old pal Senator Furman from Washington. You're going to have your village back soon. The Columbian government is going to send in troops to rescue the men and get rid of Salazar for good. Oh! that's great Dad. And there's more. I'm going to rebuild your clinic. You are?! And I am going to stay here and make sure it's done right. I should have done this a long time ago. I should have done a lot of things. But I am going to try to make it up. . . to both of you. Thank you! Tony, thanks. Thank you. I'm gonna have to go see Dr. Bob now. I'll see you two later. Okay. Wow! I never thought I'd see you and Dad together like this again. I think that qualifies as a miracle. Yeah. I want to talk to you about something. What? Tell you about something that happened in the helicopter on the way back. Ah. . . I don't know how to say it, but do you remember that story Mateo told me about the Good Shepherd and the lost sheep? Yeah, the parable. Well, that lost sheep, that was me. . . but I'm not lost anymore. Oh, Dan! He found me. I knew it, I knew something had changed! If Jim's offer is still good, and it's okay with you, I'd like to stay and help. I'm so happy! I-I've been praying for this for the past five years! For me, for five years? For us!
