Stay a while longer. I can't. My father gets angry if dinner is late. Can I see you tonight? Perhaps. Yep. Oh Lord of Darkness, Prince of Hell, hear this, thy servant's plea. Send from thy Black Realm the power that we may do thy will on Earth. Recreate this dust of centuries, that in thy service, the dead may join with the undead. Accept this sacrifice in homage. Turn now this fresh, warm blood into a body of thy making, this innocent spirit into evil! Aga, adonai, magesta mundi Te adorn, etain voco venetai, venetai Lucifer! That looks good. So do you Trudi, good enough to eat! I must go. No, there's no hurry. - A word with you, if you please, Mr. Lestrange. Oh yes, certainly, sit down. Have a glass of wine. No thank you, sir. I do not wish to appear inhospitable, sir. There is no harm in normal times to have a joke with a serving girl. A laugh or two. These are not normal times. You'll not find any young girl in this village talking to a stranger. This is your first night under this roof. It'll probably be the last. Do you know what year this is, sir? 1830, as I recall. Yes, it is 40 years to the day since they were last seen, and before that 40 years again. Oh really, who? The Karnsteins. I don't think I know them. That's their castle up on the hill. Why yes, of course. I thought they were all dead. - We call them the undead, sir, they're vampires! My God, you really believe it! We know sir. Well tell me more, I'm interested. What you said, sir, about the Karnsteins being dead is true, but they still have the power to reincarnate themselves, and now is the time for their return. I tell you sir, this village lives in a state of terror. Terror of what? They prey on young virgins. Put a spell on them. Sometimes they woo them, slowly sucking their life away. Sometimes they kill quickly, one feast, one bite of their fangs! - Well that's alright, I'm not a young virgin. Oh you can laugh, sir but men are amongst their victims too. I would not advise you to be enticed by any beautiful stranger. Just give me a chance, that's all I ask! Look, please! I realize you all feel strongly about this, but its a superstition, you've grown up with it. You can't expect me to take it seriously. I've told you all I know, sir. I can do no more. Yes, and I'm very interested. Well, that's why I came here. To get background for the books I write. I'm a novelist. As you know, I write about these things, witches, vampires, black magic, but it's a product of my imagination, and I know it. - Look sir, there is one of the village girls missing now, a good girl, not one that would just run off. Would you like to tell her parents that it's just imagination that she's disappeared? Well, she could he anywhere. Look, as you're all so terrified of Karnstein Castle, I'll go up there after lunch. I might even find one of those beautiful vampires waiting to entice me. What you said, sir, about the Karnsteins being dead is true, but they still have the power to reincarnate themselves, and now is the time for their return. But it's a superstition. Sometimes they woo them, slowly sucking their life blood away. But men are amongst their victims too! But men are amongst their victims too! But men are amongst their victims too. I would not advise you to he enticed by any beautiful stranger. We call them the undead, sir. They're vampires! Girls, girls! Girls! I don't know who you are, sir. Richard Lestrange. Would that be the Lestrange's of Cork? Yes. - Then you're Lord Thurston's son, the heir to the title? That's right, how did you know that? Geniality is my pet subject, I'm afraid. I apologize because I know I can be a bore on the subject. That's why I brought the girls to the castle. Just an excuse really to help me in my researches. Fascinating family, the Karnsteins. Yes I'm sure, but. Tell me about the girls. That's Susan Pelley. She's from the America's. And that's Isabel Courtley. One of the Hampshire Courtley's. Interesting family. Very. That's Amanda McBride. Her father's a Scottish landowner. Nice girl. - Yes. Oh but forgive me. I haven't even introduced myself. Giles Barton, and there's the school. Come along girls. Into your places! Come along now, come along! Into your places, girls. We've only been here three weeks. It's the new vogue you know, a Finishing School on the Continent. It's quite a big project for us. I teach history and and art. Miss Simpson is the principal. I'm her partner. That's Janet Mayfair, gym mistress. She was with Miss Simpson at Heathley Hall. This is a new idea in physical exercise. Based on Greek or Roman dancing. Is it? We'd better wait here. Miss Simpson doesn't allow strangers too near the girls. The class will be over in a few moments and then I shall introduce you. To Miss Playfair? No, to Miss Simpson. - The author? - Yes, I'm afraid so. And Lord Thurston's son. - Oh, well, then you will always he welcome at the school, but not, I'm sorry to say, your books. They are not suitable for girls of an impressionable age. No, I suppose not. A bit frightening perhaps, but if you'd like me to lecture on English literature at anytime. - We have an English teacher arriving on Wednesday. Now, if you'll excuse me. Yes, of course. Miss Simpson. Yes, Susan, what is it? Miss Carstairs asked me to tell you there's a coach arriving. Oh, thank you dear. That'll be the Countess Herritzen. She's bringing her niece. A new pupil. Oh, don't go yet Mr. Lestrange. I'm sure that you would like to meet the Countess Herritzen. Oh, yes. Countess. My niece, Mircalla. My partner, Mr. Giles Barton, and this is Mr. Richard Lestrange, the celebrated author. Countess. Lord Thurston's son. Shall we take tea? - That Mr. Barton's just a nasty little man. You notice the way he's always standing around watching us when we're dancing? Who was that man with him yesterday? He was good looking. I don't know. Trisha, do you know Giles Barton was with yesterday? I don't know. How do feel after your first day? Very tired. It's the dancing. It takes a little while to get used to. I shall never get used to it. Sure you will, in time. Let me do that. Does that feel better? Mmm. Come along now girls, settle down. Stop all the talking. Erica, will you go back to your own room please. Joanna, you've only got another five minutes to lights out. I think I'll take that. Alright girls, into bed now. Quickly! - Let's go down to the river tonight for a moonlight swim. Then you'll feel much better. But Miss Playfair will be around. That's easy! We'll put a couple of pillows in the bed, she'll think we're asleep. Yes. We'll go at midnight. I thought my God, they've got me! It's just as the landlord said, it's the Karnstein's come for me. I backed away from this beautiful girl. I turned to run. Come on Adolph. Good boy, come on. I froze with fear. I tell you I was petrified. And then there were three of them, all advancing from different directions, and I tried to run away! I ask you, three beautiful girls. Three beautiful girls on a educational tour of Karnstein Castle, and I thought they were vampires! Mircalla! Mircalla! Where have you been? I woke up and you weren't there. I came down by myself, then I thought I heard somebody and I went and had a look. - Probably old Giles, he's always creeping around trying to catch us with no clothes on. Did you find anyone? No. - Ale sir? - Hmm. Will you be eating, sir? Yes, I suppose so. - There's a gentleman over at that table sir, who's traveled from England. Well don't put me with him. Good day to you. Oh, good day. Biggs, Arthur Biggs. How do you do? My name's Richard. I know sir, I know, and I was delighted to find you a guest here. Won't you join me? I've read every one of your books. Thank you. That's very kind of you. - I enjoy them sir, I enjoy them, and I write myself. Oh, I don't think I've read your work. - Because it hasn't been published, that's why. My style is what the French call avaunt-garde. Yes, well it can be difficult. I live in hopes, I live in hopes. There must be somewhere, some enlightened. Perhaps you'd be good enough to read something of mine? Well yes, I'd be delighted, but I am actually rather busy at the moment, and I expect you'll be moving on shortly. No, no, no, I shall be staying in the locality, at Miss Simpson's school. At the school? - Yes, I do this work of course merely to finance my literary endeavor. - Then you must be the new teacher of English literature. I preach what I cannot practice. - My dear sir, I had no idea you were the Arthur Biggs! Well yes, I'd be delighted to read your work. Perhaps we could even collaborate on something. Collaborate? Yes, I'm planning a new novel, but it needs a great deal of research, in Vienna. Poor chap, leg broken in three places. Very sad. No doubt, but highly inconvenient. But couldn't he have used a walking stick? More serious than that I'm afraid. A tricky operation you know, hospital in Vienna. It's the only place. Then when will he be back here? Four weeks, three perhaps. - But I can't be without a teacher that long! - And so we come to the 19th Century novel, and at long last this comparatively new form began to reach the power and the grace of the age-old forms, the play, the poem. Mademoiselle, perhaps you can tell us which contemporary novelist you prefer. I'm afraid I don't know any. Oh come, you must. German, if not English. - No but I have read a lot of 18th Century work. - Your education seems to have been neglected. I am sorry. That's alright. You'll just have to have some personal tuition, that's all. Alright, let's see what the rest of you know. The later part of the 15th Century was not a particularly well documented period. In fact, we are woefully short of records for that time. However we do know that during that time when Styria was still quite a powerful country, that Kamstein Castle was built. We find our first mention of the Karnstein family in the Styrian chronicles of 1187. This as you know, is the equivalent of England's Doomsday Book. The Karnsteins have a most curious family history. Not all of it documented by any means. The first allusion to the Karnstein family was possibly in the Styrian Chronicles, that's when they were published. - Now Mr. Lestrange. - Miss Simpson. - I'm glad to see that you're taking an interest in the activities of the school at large. Oh, but of course. - And I understand that you wish to become a resident here? - Well, I did think it might be a good idea to spend more time with the girls. Marking their work and so on. Very well, I will show you your room. Thank you. We see from the Chronicle, one of which is the question of the family motto. - Don't you have anything a little nearer the house? It is excellent accommodation. You will be sharing with Mr. Giles. Better and better. Thank you. God, it's the dust from those old hooks. Where did you dig them up from? What? The books. Most important. Why, what are they about? Histories. Research material. Research into what? Karnstein Castle. It's fascinating. I know what you're after. What? You're training to be a vampire. You've been listening to village gossip. It's not all gossip. Mircalla! Forgive me for calling you by your first name but, it has a sort of magic for me. I must go. No, please! Don't go. I've tried a hundred times to be alone with you. I only came here to see you, to speak to you because, because I love you. Forgive me but I must tell you. I've loved you since the first moment I saw you. I thought I'd lived, but before then I was dead. No! Born at that moment. I've only lived since, with new feeling, with the pain of loving. Truly, for the first time, I swear! No, let me go! Forgive me. But she must have said something. No Miss Simpson. I thought she was with some girls in another room and I didn't realize until this morning that she'd not come hack. - And you are sure she said nothing about going out? Quite sure Mademoiselle. All right child. Oh, Mircalla? I'm quite sure that this is just some foolish trick that Susan is playing, but I don't want to alarm the other girls. You understand? I've told no one. Then don't. For the time being of course I mean, and if anyone should ask then Susan is in the sanatorium, suspected measles. Yes Miss Simpson. Miss Simpson, a girl has disappeared. You can't really believe it's a joke? Of course I don't, but there's no need to alarm the whole school. What are you going to do? Well we must wait a while. She may come back. I've had more experience than you of this kind of thing. Some of these girls have wild natures, they pick up with some man. Man! What man? We're miles from the village. The local people have never even been near here. Susan's only just joined the school, we don't know that she hasn't been followed. That's ridiculous! Susan is not that kind of girl at all, and in any case, if she had been abducted, as you seem to be suggesting we should still inform the police. The police? Certainly not! We must! - I will not be told to do in my own school! I did not say that she'd been abducted, I said there might be some sort of adventure. Susan will return of her own accord. And if she doesn't'? Then I will report the incident. When will you report it? Janet. I must ask you to bear with me, I know my responsibility to Susan, to all the girls, but I have other responsibilities as well, to this school. My life savings have gone into it. It's my whole future. I can't throw it away, create some silly scandal, when there might be a perfectly logical answer to why Susan's disappeared. Very well, 48 hours, but no longer. Because if you don't report it then, I will. The history of Kamstein Castle can be traced hack to beyond the Middle Ages. Incidents relating to the Karnstein family have been recorded as early as the 12th Century. Ah, now here we have an interesting example. A young Karnstein Countess, Carmilla. Born 1688 so far as I can make out, and died 1710. Probably of the plague which swept Styria at about that time. The grave is as you can see, somewhat neglected. So far as is known, none of the Karnstein family is still living. Now then. Carmilla, an unusual name, you might think, but during that period it was the fashion for a child to be given an anagram of her mother's name or some other favored female relative. Now then, let's see what, what could it have come from? Marcilla? Millarca? Mircalla! Perhaps the Herritzen family is in some way related to the Karnstein's? Do you know if this is so, Mademoiselle? No. Then I shall pursue my researches and doubtless we shall find out. Now, let's move on towards the castle itself. It has the most fascinating history, intriguing principally not. Come along! Intriguing principally not for what is said about it but for what left unsaid. The villagers have the most extraordinary stories about. Mircalla, meet me here tonight, it's important. I've found something out, you must come. Schoolmaster. Ridiculous occupation! Don't know why a man does it. Oh, it has its rewards. What rewards? - They're not always clearly visible, I admit. Oh, don't you think you should curtail the. No, that's alright, keeps me fit. One of my class wasn't there this morning. Now why wasn't she there? - Susan? - Yes. - She has a slight touch of fever I believe. She's in the sanatorium. I have a slight touch of fever myself. You'll get over it, and now, if I may suggest. Along sleep will do you much more good. Perhaps you're right. I will close my eyes for a few minutes. I'm going for a stroll. That's not a bad idea actually. I might come with you. Yes, you had to come, didn't you, because I know everything. I know who you are and why you're here. That's what I found out this afternoon. It was here at the grave, when I saw the name Carmilla I wrote it down, you saw, "Carmilla", "Mircalla." I went back, I checked my histories. I knew what I was looking for, the portrait of Carmilla Karnstein, died 1710, a 120 ago, and do you know who the portrait was of Mircalla, the portrait of Carmilla Karnstein? It was you. You. You! Stay with me. I have reversed the cross. You see I have studied your magic. I know the Black Art and I want only to know more and more. I meant no harm to you, I swear. I want only to worship you. To be your servant. To be a servant of the Devil. He will accept me I'm sure. I have proved my worth. I could have told them what I knew about you, but I stayed silent. I found the body of the girl you killed. I said nothing. I got rid of it myself, down the well. I will do whatever you demand of me! Mircalla! Please. I only want to serve you. Please I beg you. Take me. Mircalla! Mircalla! Countess! This is an honor. I was on my way to Vienna, and I thought I would take the Opportunity of paying you a visit. - We're always delighted to see you at the school, Countess. - Miss Simpson! - Miss Simpson! What's wrong? - You look like as if somebody's seen a ghost or something! Oh, poor Giles! But what could have happened, was it an accident? We'll soon know. It's fortunate that I was traveling with my personal physician. Oh, so very fortunate! The local doctor is sure to gossip and we simply can't stand a breath of scandal. There will be no scandal. Doctor? A heart attack. Oh hello. I'm sorry to disturb you. That's all right. I want to talk to you. Well then, you'd better come in. I just didn't know who else to go to, I. What's the trouble? I don't really know, but I'm sure something's terribly wrong. - Yes, well it's always upsetting when somebody dies. I expect you knew Giles quite well. No, that was horrible but. I don't think that I can explain really. It's about Susan. Susan? Oh, what's the matter with her, apart from a fever. That wasn't true. It was just a story so no one would ask questions about where she was. She's disappeared. Disappeared? - She hasn't been seen since the night before last. I wanted to go to the police but Miss Simpson begged me not to. I don't want to harm the school but. Oh, I don't know whether it's my nerves. Giles death seems somehow more than a coincidence, and I have this horrifying premonition, someone else is going to die. Oh, come on now, you're just letting your imagination run away with you. I suppose so. If only I could rid myself of this idea that Susan's disappearance and Giles are connected in some way. Giles had a heart attack. There's nothing sinister about that. Susan, that's different. Doesn't anyone know where she might have gone? Who shared a room with her? Mircalla. Mircalla? She says she knows nothing. - Well, there could he some simple explanation. You don't want to make a fool of yourself, do you?. I don't care about that! I'm too worried about Susan. I told Miss Simpson I'd wait until tomorrow. Then I'm going to the police myself. Will you come with me? I don't know. I need more time to think. Please. We don't want to he over hasty, do we? - Tomorrow? - Yes. I must get back. Mind nobody sees you. Miss Simpson would have a heart attack! Thank you. For what? For listening. Karnsteins, A History Of Evil. Witchcraft. The Vampire Legend. History of Styria. Mademoiselle Herritzen, I'd like to go over this work with you, please. Your work on the 18th Century is excellent, but quite frankly, your knowledge of writers of this century is deplorable. I must see you, talk to you. It's important. I can't. Why not? Please! - There are also a number of grammatical errors. I think you should know that I've been going through Giles Barton's papers. He'd been making some extensive researches into the Karnstein family. Quite fascinating really. I thought you might be interested. When? Tonight at the castle. Thank you, Mademoiselle. Mircalla. You have something to tell me? Yes. I love you. No, please listen to me for God's sake. It's not irrelevant. To me it's the most important thing in life. - Tell me. - What? Those notebooks. What was in them? Your name. Just my name? Mircalla and Marcilla and Carmilla. Carmilla. Yes, Carmilla. Carmilla Karnstein, and there was a portrait of you, and books of Black Magic, and histories of the Karnsteins. Evil histories, and more. - More? - Yes. What more? Mircalla, explain it to me. That's all I ask. It's quite simple, I am a Karnstein. Our family changed its name. If you've read the books you'll know why. That's why I look like Carmilla, and that's why my name is Mircalla. What else do you want to know? If I'm a vampire? Is that what you believe? Is the famous writer, Richard Lestrange, a peasant at heart? Do you believe in your own mystery and imagination? Yes, I do. I believe that things exist which are unknown to us. I believe that there is a power of evil as well as good. I've read and studied. I spent the whole of last night going through Giles' researches, and believe me they are powerful evidence. Evidence, of what? That you are a vampire. You say that and tell me you love me! Prove to me that you're not. Love me. No, no, no! I must, I must! Why? If I were a vampire then you would die! Yes. ♪ Strange Love ♪ I Silently stealing through the night I I So concealing I ♪ Two hearts suddenly feeling ♪ ♪ Strange Love ♪ ♪ Strange Love ♪ I Tender and burning ♪ I Love you've ♪ I Ever been yearning ♪ I How you ache to return this ♪ ♪ Strange Love ♪ ♪ But we know it never could he ♪ ♪ Ever ♪ ♪ Never could be ♪ ♪ Strange ♪ I Strange love ♪ Mircallla, Mircalla.

I think you should say nothing. Nothing! That's right. I think ifs all in your imagination. About Susan disappearing? - About any sinister construction you put upon it. Miss Simpson's had a lot of experience. I'm sure that she's right. - I don't see what difference it makes even if she is right. If Susan did go off with some man and I don't see how she could possibly have done, you don't think the police should have been informed? Or her parents at least! What's the matter with you? You seem different. In the last day or two you've changed. Oh, that's ridiculous! I thought of you as someone honest and courageous when you first came here. I thought I could go to you and there was no one else that. ♪ Strange Love ♪ I Silently stealing through the night I I So concealing I ♪ Two hearts suddenly feeling ♪ ♪ Strange Love ♪ ♪ Strange ♪ I Strange love ♪ Why Miss Simpson? Why, why, Why? Yes, I realize now Inspector. You realized all the time, Miss Simpson. You're an intelligent woman. At least I assume so from your profession. A young girl was left in your charge. Now she is missing. Since three days. But I had to do. I had to think of the effect on the other girls. This was a police matter. She may be dead now, lying in a ditch somewhere with her throat cut. God please! - If it had not been for Miss Playfair coming to see us this afternoon we should still be in ignorance. You say you're worried about the other girls. So am I, about their safety! I am sorry. Very well. Now this is a police matter, and quite a serious one too. This girl is a visitor here, a guest in this country. There could be serious political consequences. Has the family been told? Then you will write a letter to them immediately. Yes. I said immediately, Miss Simpson. And you will dispatch it, Miss Playfair. And then there is the death of this Mr. Barton. This too should have been reported to the authorities. My clerks have investigated and they find no report of his death. You say he's buried here. I should like to see the death certificate. Where is it? I cannot read the name of this doctor. Dr. Froheim. I do not know him. - Personal physician to Countess Herritzen. I do not know her. Mr. Raymond Pelley. He's the girl's father? Yes, he's an American but he's living in Vienna at the present time. I see. Well now, I have the details of the girl's disappearance from Miss Playfair. Is there anything you would wish to add? You did search the grounds here, around the castle hmm? Hmm? Yes, thoroughly. Both Miss Simpson and I and Mr. Barton. Mr. Barton? I thought this was kept as a secret. Giles was my partner. We started this school together. I see. Where was his body found? - I can show you. - Please. Mary! You're late! I shouldn't have come. - Why not? - You know why. No, I don't. When we loved each other that night I was so happy. But since then you've avoided me like the plague. You, you won't talk to me, you won't even meet my eyes in the classroom. - I can't! - Mircalla. No, don't question me. I can't explain. I don't want to. Mircalla, if you don't love me for God's sake just tell me. I can't bear the agony of not knowing. Mircalla, tell me. What? That you don't love me. Say it! Say it! - And then one of them discovered the body underneath there. I see. Thank you, Miss Mayfair. I'll look around by myself now. - Well, if you want me. - Yes, thank you. I must go now. No, no, please don't go. But you don't understand. My aunt's coming this afternoon. The Countess? Yes. Mircalla, let me talk to her. No! I only thought that I. It would not be correct. I, Richard. You must swear to me never to speak to her, or to speak of our love. - Mircalla, this is the 19th, not the 18th Century. No! Swear to me! All right, I swear. But only if you kiss me again. - I cannot tell you how grateful I am to you. I felt it was an impertinence. Of course not. - I just did not know to whom I could turn. You've been so kind through all these terrible troubles. You must not fret so much. So a police inspector has come here. I suppose they must do their work, but he won't make any trouble. I assure you. He was such a horrible man. He treated me as though, as though I was some kind of criminal. He bullied me. I only tried to do what I felt was right for the girls, for the school. I'm sure you have. Now don't worry about him any more. - But he's searching the grounds now! What is there for him to find? Letter! What letter? To Mr. Pelley, Susan's father. But he insisted. Has it been dispatched? Yes. Miss Playfair left for the village immediately. The scandal. I shall be ruined! That man Heinrich, he's determined to ruin me. - Don't concern yourself about Inspector Heinrich. - You must write another letter to this Mr. Pelley telling him his daughter has been found dead. But? There shall then be no further inquiries and as long as we enclose a death certificate. But how? I don't. How? You mean what did she die of? Oh, I would say of. A heart attack. - I thought at least you would help me. And I keep telling you you're letting your imagination run riot. So everyone keeps telling me, but Inspector Heinrich didn't think so. Didn't he? Well, we've heard precious little of his so-called investigation. And I can guess why. Countess Herritzen pulling strings in high places, no doubt. What the hell has she got to do with it? I'm beginning to wonder. Ever since her precious niece turned up at the school. Don't bring Mircalla into this! I'm warning you. You're warning me? I'm warning you! You're besotted with her, just like Giles was. You know that? He was always creeping around after her trying to sketch her. He couldn't keep his eyes off her. That's enough! And I'll tell you something else. Susan was infatuated with her too! Just what kind of filthy accusations are you trying to make? I'm saying that Giles is dead, and I suspect that Susan is as well. I'm saying I don't trust the Countess. She's got Miss Simpson in her power and it seems the police as well, and I'm saying that unless somebody does something about it soon there's going to be another tragedy, and if you want to know who I think is going to be the most likely victim it's you! Then it's I who should worry, not you. Except that I happen to love you, but don't let that worry you. You've been living in another world lately. Never even noticed, but if you're blind to everything else Richard don't be blind to what might happen to you. Richard please! Don't be a fool. Oh! Mircalla? - No Miss Simpson, it is not satisfactory at all, and now I find my daughter was missing three days before you even considered writing to me! I tried to explain. - Unfortunately I was away when that letter arrived, but then I hear from you that my daughter has been found dead. I'm not going to mince my words. You don't say passed away except when someone's had a good life and moved on. My daughter was a healthy girl. I don't believe she had a heart attack. But the doctor. The doctor! Who the hell is this doctor? The moment I got the news I tried to get in touch with him. Naturally I want to know how a thing like this could happen. I even had experts try and find him everywhere in Vienna. They couldn't even find his name. I don't understand you Mr. Pelley. What is it that you're suggesting? - I'm not making suggestions, just statements of fact. One, I have no proof that my daughter is dead. Two, given that proof I want to know how she died. I don't accept that certificate as evidence. I want to know exactly what happened to her. What can I do? - You don't have to do anything Miss Simpson. You've done quite enough. You had no right to have my daughter buried without waiting for instructions from me. But you said yourself you'd gone away! I was soon contacted. The point is I am not satisfied, and I don't like having doubts in my mind. Now I brought with me Professor Hertz, he's a pathologist, and I have here authority for exhumation. I just don't understand anymore. Its been like a nightmare. Grave digging- But we don't know where Susan is. But we do. You had so much trouble I didn't want to worry you. I had everything taken care of for you. Open it. Miss Simpson is quite exhausted. The doctor said she must rest. The doctor. Your doctor. Yes. - Who signed my daughter's death certificate. Yes. - The one who I find is not registered in Vienna. - Doctor Froheim does not practice in Vienna. - I have my doubts Madam whether Doctor Froheim should be allowed to practice anywhere! My daughter had severe bodily injuries. Of course. Of course? These were not mentioned in the death certificate nor in the letter to me. There's been a deliberate evasion of truth, and you say of course! - Your daughter died when her heart failed. That is what Doctor Froheim said, and it is for your expert to disprove it. Her other injuries were caused, when she threw herself. She what? - Threw herself from the top of Castle Karnstein. Suicide is not a pleasant word Mr. Pelley. My God! - And in my opinion Miss Simpson was quite right in her attempt to shield you from more grief than was necessary, and the school from unpleasant gossip. Suicide but why? - You are divorced from your wife I believe? Yes, but. I understood that Susan's home life was not entirely happy. That's not true! I don't believe it! I won't believe it. - The theory is perfectly consistent with my examination. A heart attack. Probably during the fall. A quite usual occurrence. But there are certain reprehensible aspects of the matter goes without saying. I should certainly like the chance of a word with this Doctor Froheim. Whoever he may be. - But there were these marks on her throat. I can give no explanation of them. - Tell me doctor, do you think there's any truth to these stories that they tell? Vampires? Oh, I know it sounds ridiculous but I'd be willing to believe anything before I'd even imagine that Susan could. You did say there was a great loss of blood. Understandable, in the circumstances. If they were the circumstances. - Mr Pelley, I told you I cannot with certainty say that you daughter died for any reason but that her heart stopped heating. They're arguing about it now, but there's no argument about the marks on the girl's neck. Fritz saw them himself. And there's the schoolmaster too. Heart attack, they said. - There's evil in that castle and always will be. I can do nothing. We are talking about matters beyond science, about the darker imaginings of men, about metaphysics, the nature of Good and Evil. You don't need a doctor, you need. This looks a comfortable enough place. I've had my fill of journeying for today. My Lord. I say let's all go up there and put a stake through their evil hearts. Oh, calm down Hans. His lordship will know what has to be done. Mircalla. Mircalla! Mircalla! You've got someone in there. Who is it? I want to know! Mircalla. You must be tired my Lord. Yes Mr. Pelley, I am tired, but to exorcize evil spirits is part of my holy duty, and there are no spirits more evil than those of the Karnstein's. - Burn them all! - Kill 'em! Hans, what's going on for God's sake? I thought you were up at the school. No, I was on my way to the inn. You won't find anyone there. All the villagers are on this march. March, where to? To the castle! What for? To find the Karnsteins, or their graves. Dig up their bodies and and stake their evil hearts! It's horrible! Yes, but they are agents of the Devil, and they can only live on human blood. Is there no other way? None. Only a stake through the heart or decapitation will serve. - But there are no Karnsteins, they're all dead. Not their spirits. They take on the form of others and no one knows them. Well how will you? - At night, sated by the blood of their victims they return to their graves. There we'll find them! Oh my God! My Lord, my Lord, you must stop them. You must! Get off, get yourself out of it! Let go, let go! Get your hands off me! Listen to me, damn you, listen to me! She's a victim too, I must save her. - Who? - Mircalla. Mircalla! Too late. - Give me a stake! - I'll do it! Burn down the castle! No, wait, wait, wait! Stop! Stop you fools! Burn 'em out, kill 'em! Burn them! Stop! Stop you fools! Fire is useless. Burn 'em, kill 'em! Tell them to hold their torches. Fire will not serve. Nothing will destroy them but to stake or decapitation! Give me the torch! Let me go, let me go! For God's sake, I beg you. Let me go. Let me go! Nay! There is no death for us in fire! That man, stop him! Stop him. Don't let him go in there! Don't be a fool. Mircalla! Mircalla! Mircalla! Richard! Richard, get out! Get out! Lestrange! Come on! Come on, let's get out of here! Richard. Oh, thank God! Janet Let us pray. Oh God, our father. We thank thee for delivering us from this evil. Thy power and thy glory have fought and vanquished these Servants of the Devil. For this we offer up our humble thanks.
