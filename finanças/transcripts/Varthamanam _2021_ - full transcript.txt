'News' Faiza, Nothing, I was saying that..., It was during the last monsoon season, I came here for the very first time. Then, the river had completely overflowed. Moreover, you could see fish literally this huge, wriggling awfully on the banks. Is this Yamuna? Which Yamuna? Yes mam, it's The Yamuna. Oh, the river's name, huh? It's Yamuna. You didn't know that? Mister, You'd better drive, and not neck into our talk. What? Don't interfere, that's it. You can't survive here without knowing the (Hindi) language. These people will dance on your head. Brother, We're here for an admission in this college. Oh, That side? Alright. I'll see to this. Faiza, stay inside. Better keep yourself away from the sun. - I'll speak to him. - Tell me I want to go to the Admission Department. - Sure, you may go inside. - Here is the letter. Alright, please sign here. Sign here. Be careful. - Make it fast. - Yeah, you have to fill this first. Oh, classrooms here look like tent houses. - This is correct, I believe? - Fill this one, OK? Hi, May I help you? Hi. Hi. I've come for admission. Where do I go? Give us your mobile number. Please write it over here. 98954 Faiza Sufiya. S-U-F-I-Y-A. I've been pondering over something since I read your proposal. Why Abdur Rahiman Sahib? Sir, The very first book I got to read in my life is the autobiography of Abdur Rahman Sahib, written by my own grandfather. Of course, no other book could be a better choice for the granddaughter of Palliath Alikoya Mussaliar to start off with. Even now, I suggest Alikoya Mussaliar's books as a credible source for knowing more about Abdur Rahman Sahib. How is Mussaliar's health now? Even though he faces some health challenges due to aging, he still can do his chores independently. He still reads and writes actively. Let me ask you, where exactly are you focusing in this subject? Sir, during the Indian freedom struggle, on the basis of religion, there was an active demand for a separate state of Pakistan. Even people of Malabar were emotionally supporting that movement. During then, it was Abdur Rahman Sahib who convinced the public for an undivided India where both Muslims and Hindus live peacefully. That is where I'm going to focus. Later, he had to suffer a lot of torture from religious extremists for the same. - Am I right? - True. Then, they used to have a slogan. Do you know it, Faiza? "Will use our sharp knives to claim our Pakistan." - ..Pakistan". - Yes. Moreover, When Khilafat Movement of Malabar was turning violent, It was Sahib who kept down these Muslims. There's a famous speech made by him standing on a bullock-cart, addressing those weapon-baring Muslims. His words were truly a realization for the people who had turned blind because of their insane ideologies. All of them put down their weapons as the speech concluded. Despite all this, I wonder how many in this new generation know about Abdur Rahman Sahib? That's very true. Now a days, secularism is diminishing in our country. In this scenario, I wish if the new generation people could know more about Abdur Rahman Sahib. That is why I decided to choose his life as my research subject. Very good. A research on the very first book you've read, isn't it? Very Interesting. In fact, I'm not your guide but your own grandpa. I'll be just a facilitator. Well, Since 'Religious Identity' is also a part of the subject, You will have to use new research methodologies. Ok, sir There's a book called 'Muslims Against Partition'. - Written by Shamsul Islam. - Shamsul Islam. - Exactly. - You may refer that. In fact, you are going to do an intense research for your project. - You should never let the fire subside. - Sure, sir. Moreover, research is a difficult task. You will be all alone most of the times. You shouldn't even think of a part time job. Huh... sir, But, you wouldn't need to work since you have a JRF. Yes, that's also why I'm here. Moreover I know that if I stay home, my marriage is going to be an international issue. They will not think of it once I'm out of station. So you've formed a super plan, huh? Nothing like that. I was just kidding. Another thing is, hostel allotments are going to get late. Anyways, I've made an interim arrangement. OK. Hello Amal, - No one here is your kin. - No one here is your kin. - VC is a weakling. - VC is a weakling. - Campus is full of thieves. - Campus is full of thieves. - VC is a weakling. - VC is a weakling. - Campus is full of thieves. - Campus is full of thieves. - VC, you have distanced yourself. - VC, you have distanced yourself. - Nobody here is your kin. - Nobody here is your kin. - Rohan is the light of our campus. - Rohan is the light of our campus. Amal, hey, - Now, VC, its your turn. - Now, VC, its your turn. - Pothuval sir sent her here. - What? Pothuval sir sent her here. Meet her. - Where is she? - She's here. Hi, just a minute, I'll introduce someone to you. Thulsa, you remember Pothuval sir talking about a girl? Just talk to her for a minute and be back. - Students' Unity Zindabad. - Zindabad... - Go back, Vice Chancellor! - Go back, Vice Chancellor! - VC should Resign. - VC should Resign. - Hi, I'm Thulsa. - Hi, I'm Faiza. Did you know Pothuval sir from back home? No, I've only heard about him. He's an extraordinary genius. He's one of the living authorities of Indian Political History, you know? - This is ready. - Thank you. - It's yours. - Thank you. That is why I wanted to come to this university to do research, you know? Who's that student leader? - Oh, that's Amal. - Amal? He's the University Union Chairman. And he is also my best friend. We want justice. - Justice for... - Rohan. - Zindabad Zindabad... - Zindabad Zindabad... - Students' unity Zindabad. - Students' unity Zindabad. Students' unity Zindabad. - Students' unity Zindabad. - Students' unity Zindabad. - We want Justice. - We want Justice. Justice for Rohan. - We want to meet VC. - He's not inside. - We want to talk to VC. - He's gone out for a meeting. Stop, Stop, Stop, one second. Stop! I'm telling you he's not here. He's not here. He's gone for a meeting. - Who else shall we speak to? - PVC called him for a meeting. He's not here. Sir, Rohan's issue. Sir, this is not the first issue of this kind. The University has been showing a bad face to backward Dalit students. This is part of a clear political agenda. There is a deliberate attempt to wipe off students of a particular community from the campus. Sir, you yourself know how difficult it would be, when a student like Rohan is deprived of his stipend. Isn't it cruel to behave like this to him after knowing his financial condition? You are deliberately taking away the security that has been offered to him by the constitution. See, this is not an issue that can be decided at our own discretion. It's beyond our control. Better you may approach higher authorities. Sir, if you're not empowered to take a decision to solve issues of a poor student of this University, Then, what is the use of holding on to this chair? Listen, I know very clearly what to do, and what not to do. You needn't teach me, you may go now. We really don't want to stir up the campus into an agitated mood. But you're forcing us to do it. Same way, don't think that this issue will be confined to this University alone. The entire country is going to take it over. And we'll make it happen. Come, there's no use of talking to him. Get going. Try and put me also in some sports quota. Sushil bro, We have shown the power of our leadership once again. The Students Union strike has absolutely no effect on the grip of PVC. You see. - They can't do anything. - True. Our national leaders right, they know exactly how to tackle this issue. These issues in the name of Dalits, minorities... Everything will be dusted off. This campus needs to be disciplined. These South Indians right, they are the biggest problem here. Specially, those people from Kerala. First of all, they easily pass all of their examinations. Secondly, they... So, we're also anti-nationalists who cleared the entrance exam? No, I was not talking about you. Sorry guys. - You guys are exception. - Oh, isn't it? - But it is true. They are using our campus for conducting anti national activities for getting support from the youth. They are even recruiting candidates from this campus. It is our responsibility to identify and rip them apart. - Yes, mom. - Faizu, - Hearty greetings, mom. - Bless you, my girl. What's up honey? Did you take bath? Yes, I took bath and, I'm done with the prayers too. Did you eat anything? Nope, just going to have food. Mom, let me switch to a video call? Don't you want to see my room? Oops! No need of a video call. I'm all dirt and sweat. C'mon mom, that's OK. You're beautiful, as always. Wait, wait, wait, Let me wear the shawl properly. Mom, see, this is my five star hostel room. Good. Just a moment. This is my room mate, Thulsa. - Hi Mom, - Hi. How are you? [Speaks Malayalam] I'm good, dear. Thulsa is not from here, but Utharakhand. But, she has a lot of Malayali friends here. Thus knows Malayalam very well. - Where is grandpa? - He's here. I'll just give the phone to him. Just a second. Dad, it's Faizu on call. Yes, Faiza, Hearty greetings, Grandpa. Bless you, my girl. How's you knee pain? I'm alright. - How's your stay and food? - All good. I met the Professor. He asked about you. I'll call you sometime, when the Professor is there with me. Grandpa, I'll introduce my room mate to you. - Thulsa, she's Thulsa Chakma. - Alright. Hi grandpa, how are you? Hi Thulsa, I'm fine. How are you? - I'm fine. - Where are you from? I'm from Utharakhand. Bachavar. Wow! The heaven on earth. And which part of Utharakhand? Bachavar, it's a small village. It's very near to Mussorie. Oh, Mussorie? I've been to Mussorie once. Great. People there are very good. - It's true. - And the place is amazing. OK, then..., - Grandpa, - Yes, honey, You may hang up. OK Mom, Grandpa, I'll call later. - OK Then, - Peace be upto you. And unto you peace. ''VC is a weakling.'' ''VC is a weakling.'' ''Camous is full of thieves.'' Thulsa, There... What's happening there? Song! We often have Hartal at night. Our campus is much active at night. - Harthal? - Yes. You're really blessed to have such a grandpa. I've not seen my dad. So, he is my everything; my dad, grandpa, best friend... Nice. My mom's wish was to see me as a doctor. But my grandfather could sense my area of interest. And he supported me for... Oh, I'm so sorry, I was speaking in Malayalam. From Medicine to History? A drastic shift, dear! My mom didn't like me going too far for my studies. So, she didn't let me go alone any where for my PG. But later, She let me come here only because of my Grandfather's strong recommendation. I had always dreamt of studying in this campus. And my brother, Vilas. He's my biggest supporter. And you know, It's my brother who wishes to see my name written as 'Dr.Thulsa Chakma', even more than I do. And I will fulfill his dream. Faiza, do you know? I'm the first research student from my community. So you're going to be the first Doctor from your community? Yeah, like Dr.Bhim Rao Ambedkar. Wow! So, you're going to make history, Thulsa? Yes. Finally. - 'VC is powerless.' - 'VC is powerless.' 'The system is full of thieves.' - VC, you're the darkness.' - VC, you're the darkness.' 'Rohan is the light of our campus.' Thank you, Very good, very good, very good. Thank You, Thank you. I want to salute you all for coming here today, to fight for 'Justice for Rohan'. But, I've a few things more to tell you. I want it to be more or less informal. This struggle is not just for 'Justice for Rohan'. Whatever happening with Rohan can't just be seen as a one time incident. It's visible in every university, every educational institution in India. This is all coz of Caste Discrimination. The authorities had now criminalized dissent. And against this, we need to fight. So, from now, our movement is going to go forward ever stronger. And remember one thing, If we stay united, we can show everyone, what is right, and what is wrong. If we all fight together, Victory is ours. So guys, what I want to say is, If you still have faith, If you still have belief in democracy, in this University, in me, and most importantly in yourself. Please stay with me, and shout out loud with zeal and zest; - 'Stop Caste Discrimination.' - 'Stop Caste Discrimination.' - 'Let casteism die.' - 'Let casteism die.' - 'Zindabad, Zindabad, ' - 'Zindabad, Zindabad, ' - Student's Unity Zindabad. - Student's Unity Zindabad. Dear Amal, I'm very tired of chanting slogans. - Buy me something to eat. - OK, move. Who is this new follower? Hi, Faiza, - Hi, - I'm Haibi Chamman. I'm a poor Christian guy from Trissur. Didn't you tell her everything? Dude, it's fine, I can explain it to her. Normally, new comers ought to sponsor dinner for a week. It's been a custom of our University for years. It goes unsaid that the Customs are to be followed at any cost. Yes, we know, we know. - Do you really know Malayalam, Thulsa? - Of Course! She is considered as the 'Mother of Malayalam' here. In fact, she had tried to teach me Hindi. But to our surprise, she started speaking good Malayalam in just three months. Now, many people are approaching her for learning Malayalam. Yeah, What Haibi taught me initially was to swear in Malayalam. To swear? - To swear? - Yes, minimally. What cuss words? Patti, Chetta, Nari... [Cuss words in Malayalam] These stunning words are my contribution. But not the ones coming up. - OK, get going you dumbass. - Stop it. But, you only taught me these. Didn't you go home yet? Sit, Thulsa. I'll order the food, and be back. Hi bro, What's Rohan's issue all about? Oh, you haven't met Rohan, Have you? He'll be here in some time. He's one of the Dalit activists in our group. He's from a very poor family in Andhra. Haven't you heard of Ambedkar Student's Movement? Yes. One of the strongest voices of the movement in our University. So, he's always been in the black list of High Caste Fascist. Did you meet Sushil? No, who's he? You should meet him. He's leading BVS here. He posted some content on Facebook, speaking ill of Ambedkar Student's Union. Rohan questioned him about it. But his response was kinda bad. Naturally, Rohan reacted. It almost ended up in a fist fight. The real issue here is something else. After the incident, a fake criminal case was filed against Rohan by them. Sighting this as a reason, the University withheld his stipend. It's been three months since then. Rohan is devastated. His hapless family, the humiliation he faces here, University's attitude... Yeah, They are suppressing our voices in our own land. If this is what we get from the University, where else are we going to get justice from? Hey, C'mon, join us. - Hi Vyshnav, - How are you? Come, sit. - He's Rohan. - Sit, chap. He's Vyshnav. He's from Rajasthan. The one and only rebellious son of a super rich gold merchant of Rajput Dynasty. Hey, brother, Vyshnav will pay you. Rohan, Vyshnav gave it for you. How long is this possible? Don't feel that you're alone. Don't even think about it. OK? Come. I am Faiza's... Local Guardian. - What? - Oh god, How do I make him understand that I'm her local guardian. Hey, hello... It's nothing. I'm Faiza's 'Local Father'. Local Daddy. Local Daddy? - Yes, Local Daddy. - Local Daddy? Are you still laughing? Let her come. Then you will understand who am I to her. You're not a cop, are you? Haris, what happened? Finally, you're here. I told him that I'm your local guardian. He doesn't understand it. He neither knows Hindi nor English, he must be Bengali. - Man, understand one thing, - Please come here. - What's it? - Just come. Haris, don't make it an issue. I have to study here for another 2-3 years. Alright, I am leaving it just because you asked. I'm dangerous otherwise. By the way, Faiza, what's wrong with you? You look terrible in just two days of stay here. Don't you like the food here? Nothing like that. I don't have any problem here. Can't believe that. Anyways, let's go out. There's a famous hotel here. You'll get to eat yummy Mutton chaps and Porotta. I'm not dressed up for an outing, Haris. I came down just because you called, thinking there's something urgent. What's there to dress up so much? Just wear the scarf... You just have to wear the scarf properly, and you're ready. Come, hurry up. Come, Faizu. Come Faizu, get inside. First of all, I'd like to say that We shouldn't approach this issue as a one time incident happened in the purview of this campus. And you all must be knowing and feeling that enthusiasm, that the new leadership has brought in to National politics. The leadership has conveyed its willingness to take part and take responsibility of this strike. Even by making its presence in this campus. And it has requested that in this fight for 'Justice for Rohan', All of you; that is all the secular forces should stay united and fight for this cause. And our promise to you is, We are there with you in this fight, and will be too. We will win for sure. Jaihind. In fact, it is unbelievable that a person like Rohan is being harassed in a campus like this. This is the university in India, famous for total freedom. If heinous things like this happen in such a campus... Those good old days saw its end long back. The Fascists are overpowering the campuses using power. To be frank, It's now we understand the heights of freedom we had enjoyed in our times. The critiques then are now aware of the truth. Anyways, I appreciate the decisions taken at our meeting. A strategy where all the student organizations hold hands together... Not just in our college, this should spread across the country. There you are! Oh Faizi, you were here? Adharsh, From whatever I've heard about her, she's a genius. Just that she sips coffee with us. I'm afraid whether you would lure her to your group. But, I'm not afraid of it. She was our magazine editor at Devagiri college. Yeah, I know. Now listen, the thing is, Regarding Rohan's issue, nothing favorable to us has happened till now. As far as I know, their next step is his dismissal. We should be taking a very strong initiative against this immediately. Very much. Our party's senior leadership has already decided to take over this strike. Yes, that's what even I had in mind. I've a suggestion too. For the movement to be strong, the followers should also be strong. So, let's eat something, and then... You may continue your serious discussion. I'm hungry. See, what we need right now is form a coordinated group of all the anti fascists associations in our campus. To begin with. That's a great idea. What I feel is like... It's better to exclude organizations running along religious line from this. Moreover, subjects like religion and faith are strictly personal matters. It is dangerous if we mix them along with this. This movement should strictly be seen from a secular perspective. That's what I think. That's true. So, I gave it to him for review. And he said he will send it. - Asslamu Alaikum (Greetings among Muslims) - Wa Alaikum Assalam I'm Hana Fathima. We work for 'Campus Fronts'. Faiza, are you busy to talk for a while? That is... You guys carry on. I'm going to my room. - OK. - Bye. I'm Jamal, Jamal Hussain. From Thikkodi, Kozhikode. She's Hana from Thiruvananthapuram. He's Jafry and she's Mushra. Both of them from UP. Faiza, how's your hostel? - Are you comfortable? - Yes. If not, you can share any one of our rooms. No, it's fine. I'm comfortable with Thulsa. Thank you. That's fine. Though less in numbers, we're very active here. Despite this, we have Quran class on every Friday. There's a forum for discussing social issues. But not politics. You should come for the class. We're here to invite you. We have Saifudin Ali Naqvi's class next week. Faiza would've heard of him. It's highly intellectual. Moreover, you can meet our people when you come to the class. This would be a protection for you in a non-native place like this. Something like safeguarding our identity, am I right? Nope... that is... next week.. I'm sorry, I don't think I can make it next week. Anyways, I'll update. Don't worry. You're not alone. We can go together. - OK, See you. - Alright. - Catch you later. Yup. OK. Let's go. Rohan, Your phone is ringing. Rohan, Pick the call. It's my dad. To speak about stipend. What could I tell him? C'mon, just talk to him. Why getting tensed? Hello, Yes, dad. It will take a week more. He will give it to you by next week. OK. OK, dad, I have a little to study. I will call you back. OK. He says that he's received a bank notice today. My house has been under mortgage. That's why... Dad is not working now. If I fail to give money, we'll lose our roof. The partition of Indian mind was first achieved through the writing of history known as ' Historiography'. They wrote a history of India by dividing our Indian history into three parts. Hindu India, Muslim India, and British India. This categorization was historically crucial for the construction of religious Identity of India. They reduced the people into their immediate identity. That of Hindus or Muslims, in an attempt to rule Indians. These historians had no idea about Indian history or reality. James Stuart Mill, who gave us grand theories pitting Indians against fellow Indians hadn't visited India ever. They had only looked at colonial sources to make these theories about hundreds of years in the lives of millions of people. They looked at everything from a religious perspective. Another important thing is, one second, Muhammed of Ghazni, the Muslim king has attacked temples for the wealth accumulated in the temple those days. Only for the wealth accumulated in the temple. They made this economical interest invisible, and projected only the religious identity of the king which was unknown here. Thank you all, thank you. Thank you. Done for today. Hi, how are you? Ah, good, good. You noted everything. You try to write it. Refer good books. Study well, have a good day. Thank you. - Sir, - Yes Adharsh, We'll conveniently talk later. OK, done. Faiza, - Sir, it was interesting. - Thank you, Faiza. As if I confronted with some bare truths from the history. It is truth for some people, and untruth for others. Greetings Sir, Sir, but I have a doubt. Have the kings had any agenda of promoting their religion? No, nothing of that sort. They were more fond of wealth and power. Muslim kings hardly addressed the poor Muslims of their kingdom. They socialized more with wealthy Hindus. The same was the case with Hindu kings. Wow, amazing. Now I've a clearer picture of it. In fact, we have a wrong understanding of our own History. The truths have been manipulated by people with vested interests. True. Sir, Sorry, I was a little busy. It's all right. How far along is United Student's Movement relating to Rohan's issue? We feel more confident after all the anti fascist forces have united for this cause. - Good. And we've decided to stay together in future also. Very good. And the time demands it, right? Yes. - Have you enrolled Faiza in your gang? - Long back... We were short of an NSO activist. Now, it's done. So, now you've affiliates from all the parties? Yes, now it's like a United Student's Movement. Very good. What is your plan for the evening? - Nothing. - Nothing in particular. If so, let's huddle at my house this evening. It's been 30 years since we started tolerating each other. - Your wedding anniversary? - Yes. And you're telling this in the eleventh hour? You know me, Amal, I'm least interested in celebrations. Varsha arranged everything. OK Sir, I'll definitely come. - See you there. - Sure. We were waiting for you. - Where were you? - I was here only. - You like the food? - Yes, very good. - Hi. - Mam, it's you? - Come. - Please sit. It's OK. It's OK. Sit down. Comfortable? Thank you. Faiza, How are you? Did you visit places in Delhi? Yes, she has a rocking local guardian here. So, we covered almost all the Malayali restaurants in Delhi. Who's that? Mam, they are just kidding. Not many places... There's ample time for it. Faiza, Mam is working in SBI Bank as Deputy General Manager. Mam, how is banking sector going on? Very strong. Indian economy is very strong after demonetization. Since you say, our economy is very strong, can you waive off my educational loan of 5 lakhs? - Isn't it just a petty amount? - Zip your mouth. Around 10 farmers are committing suicide everyday in our country. Even their loans are not being waivered. Then why talk about educational loan? Waiving off loans can't be considered as a good economic policy. Yes, that's true. But our banks can waive off billions and trillions of money availed by big shot corporate companies. That is a very brilliant economic policy. Our country is in peril. Reserve Bank governors are scooting off their positions. Is this the strong economic condition you're talking about? See Amal, study the matter first, and then talk. Yes, the government can't afford to pay back my loan. It's OK, we understand. - Mam, you explain on the basis of your studies. - Can you just stop it? Hi sir, when did you come here? Faiza, don't get scared hearing all these. They fight whenever they meet. You eat. Thank you Thank you so much. Hope you all enjoyed the song. All of us have gathered here is to recollect the memories of a happy love story, dating back to 30 years. As this is a night, all wet in lovely memories, Let's listen to a Malayalam song next. Another specialty of the song is... It is composed by... our dearest.. Professor, Shri. Satish Pothuval. "Love." "Oh, my love..." "You are an ever-flowing river of love." "You are a chilling rain in the desert." "You are the light of my life, like the sun rays in the morning." "You are the rhythm of my nights." "You are the colorful dreams of my heart." "And that's the essence of happiness in my life." "You are an ever-flowing river of love." "You are a chilling rain in the desert." "The sun rays climb up the steps." "And the streets of my mind is all crowded." "The light just fades away." "The birds fly away." "Was it a shadow or broken dreams?" "The light just fades away." "The birds fly away." "Was it a shadow or broken dreams?" "Sailing through the depths of life," "You shower me with the fragrance of happiness." It's just a matter of 5 minutes more, know? They have been saying it from the morning... - I'll be right back. - How beautifully are they making it! - Will it get late? - Yes. Simply standing and staring at it will not help. This is an art. Get me some paint, dude. - How is it? - It's really good. You can almost see the fire in his eyes know? Yeah. It's better to apply a dark shade there. These are allowed here only. It seems they have started removing the statues out there. And for which they're suffering now. The entire country collapsed. Yeah. They should think along his line if at all they're to have a hope. OK, no comments. Well, You've been a staunch advocate of Nehru's Economic Policies. Then why this silence? You people never bothered Nehru when he is alive. And now you hail him. It's true. It's true. If his economic policy wasn't there, our country would've had a tough time. I can't completely agree to it. But, in a way... I don't mind you continuing with your theories and stretch. But one thing, Leader, Unni's hotel will close shortly. [Indistinct Chattering] Shucks! Hey, Haibi, Yup. Can you just move your ass a bit? Ass? Shucks! I could've worn something inside. Shove off, you dumbass. Dang! An idiot who doesn't value artists. Cool, OK. That's nice. Faiza, you know, this place is not like ours. We have total freedom in this campus. But, a mistake that everyone makes is their friends. Faiza, don't get offended. None of your friends align to our beliefs. They believe in Materialism. I'm sorry. I've my own stance on these topics. They were not formed overnight. For the very same reason, I'm not afraid that I might lose it somewhere. Regarding my friends, Whether or not they are believers, it is not going to affect my friendship with them. They are good people. Friendship is as simple as that, isn't it? OK Then. Have a good day. Yeah. Hello Thulsa, how are you? - Hi bro, how are you? - I'm good. - What about you? - I'm good too. - And how's mom? - She's fine. Well, where are you now? I'm here at hostel. Good. Good. How's your studies going on? - Good going. - Great. Had food? Yes. - Where is Faiza? - She is here. With me in the hostel. Say my Hello to Faiza. Faiza, brother is saying a 'Hi' to you. Hi, She's saying 'Hi' to you. A mere 'Hi' will not do. Let me speak to her. Faiza, he wants to talk to you. One minute, bro. Hi bro, How are you? She's asking how you are. Good. Good. What else? We... Your wedding... [Tries to speak Hindi] We're coming. We're all coming. She says that they will be joining us for your marriage. Sure. - OK. Take care. Bye. - Bye. OK Bhaiyya. Bye. OK, Bye Thulsa, Take care. Everything good at home? All good. Mom asks me always. Have you heard this song before? This song was composed within days of Mahathma Gandhi's demise. Muhammed Rafi was just 24 when he sang this song. Jawaharlal Nehru broke into tears hearing this song. Sir, we're going to Jamiamilia, right? Yes. Yes. Jamiamillia University can be traced back from the history of our Freedom Struggle. During the Indian Independence movement, the British lured some Muslim Scholars. They also provided educational institutions for the Muslims to impart colonial education. They asked these scholars to issue Fatwa in favour of British Rule. A few people like Syed Ahmmed Khan got slipped into their trap. Sir, But we know Syed Ahmmed Khan as Renaissance leader. Yes, that's true. But he was against Indian Freedom Struggle. He believed that only if he held hands with the British, he could help the community. But, majority of the Muslim scholars were against it. They issued Fatwa against British rule. Jamiamillia University was an institution started by them with the support of Congress. Britishers had tried to demolish this institution several times. Then, leaders including Gandhiji strived hard to retain the institution They even sought contribution from the public for the same. Jamiamillia University has a big role in imparting secularism in young minds. This is where Abdur Rahman came for pursuing his studies. This is the room Abdur Rahman occupied in this hostel. Faiza, Yes, sir. You may present the next seminar. Oh sir, me? It's a part of your research. Isn't it too soon...? You've been researching on the subject since you started learning alphabets. So, won't this time enough for you? - Sir, don't make fun of me. - No, no, no, no. I'm serious. It's Thulsa's brother's marriage next week. - So, can I do the seminar... - Yup, you can do it after you're back. - OK, Sir. - OK. Come. OK guys, tickets confirmed. Good, What time? 10.30 PM. OK. Huh, don't we have to buy a gift for Thulsa's brother? Ops, Need it all? Yes, of course. - Why not? - Really? Come, let's go out, and buy something. Let's go and buy it right now. We have time. - Let's go? - Yep. You may go. I want to take rest. It's fasting from tomorrow. What? What fasting? If you're lazy to come, just tell that. That's not it. I'll get hungry quickly. And I know that you don't have a single penny with you. My comedy would be a flop. But, look there. A real comedian is coming to us. Why aren't you picking my calls? How long have I been calling you? I forgot my phone at the hostel. What happened? Why are you here? I thought of taking you out. We are going out now. So, I can't come with you. We? Who all? We all. This isn't your place. This is Delhi, a very dangerous place. Someone well informed has to accompany you. You needn't go alone with them. I'll also join you. Haris, we're a lot of people all together. How come you come along with us? That's OK. I'll come. Don't go alone. Faiza, why worrying? Let him come with us. Isn't it, Haris? You just come. Amal, we're having food before or after shopping? - The first option would be fine. - Cool. So, let's eat first. You come along with me. What the heck? You walk. Come, let's go. Come. What is it, Haris? I'm heavy? What a question? I can sit in the back seat if you want. No, he isn't heavy. As if I've kept some sponge on my lap. Aren't you eating at all? By the way, I've something to tell you all. Our lovely Haris will decide from where to eat, and what to eat. No one should interfere in it. I will not allow it also. What you say, Haris? Delhi isn't familiar to us as you do. I know Delhi. Moreover you don't go out that much. I'll take you. We go out very often. This may be Your first outing. But Faiza wouldn't be accompanying you, right? We never go out without Faiza. As if you're ignorant. Ops, don't sleep on me. Sit properly. It can be this way also. Food has come. Excuse me, The Steam Cake is crumbled. I want a perfect one. This Steam Cake... is crumbled. [Tries to speak Hindi] Which means... Er... - Just tell him. - This is broken. He doesn't want broken ones. One new... Steam Cake. Pass it. The thing is, I don't eat crumbled Steam Cake. That's my habit since childhood. - Faiza knows about it. - Yes, yes. At his place, the Steam Cake from the maker is directly pushed into the mouth. You'd better zip your Big Mouth. - You understand one thing, - Anyways, we eat it after crushing it. So what? How do we eat rice? By mixing it, right? But the supplier doesn't mix it for us. That's true. That's.... Don't you ever talk to me. Gobble the food and leave. Whatever, I'll only eat unbroken Steam Cake. Pass it, Pass it, what the heck, Haibi? Pass it man. Pass it. Give it to Rohan. Give it to me. But, isn't it crumbled? That's OK. Once in a while, I eat crumbled ones also. May be their Steam Cake maker is not good. It's not good to blame them every time. What the crap is he doing? "Oh, my friends." "Oh, my friends." "To fly along the sweet blowing wind." "With colorful dreams inside the eyes." "We travel through the same path of life." "The dusk is coming in." "It's the wave of darkness everywhere." "Come to me, as the light of moon." "I search for you over the trees, over the skies." "You are the rhythm of my heart." "Life looks so alive." "My ways are more easy with you." "We will stay like this, always." "We will be friends forever." "We listen to the rhythm of winds..." "Blowing in the fresh morning." "Let's live every moment of happiness." "Everyday, every moment." "The breezy wind comes chuckling and giggling." "To spread colours into our lives, like the colorful threads." "Oh, the lovely rainbow, you journey through our minds." "Filling droplets of love and joy inside us." "This is a moment of jubilation." "And, the waves of life moves in track." "You all make my life, today." "To fly along the sweet blowing wind." "With colorful dreams inside the eyes." "We travel through the same path of life." "I search for you over the trees, over the skies." "You are the rhythm of my heart." "Life looks so alive." "My ways are more easy with you." "We will stay like this, always." "We will be friends forever." "Life looks so alive." "My ways are more easy with you." "We will stay like this, always." "We will be friends forever." "We listen to the rhythm of winds..." "Blowing in the fresh morning." "Let's live every moment of happiness." "Everyday, every moment." - I can't do this. - Hey, listen, I'll go home, and take bath in the morning. - Amal, are you cold? - Yes, a bit. Look at Sindh, wow! What a beautiful place? What are you doing there? You also come. Do you know what I'm thinking right now? Our Thulsa, right? How painstakingly she comes to the University from such a remote place? We at least got a tractor to reach Thulsa's house. We had to walk nearly 3 hours to reach Rohan's house. Enough, buddy. Let's go. Where are you going? - You'll fall down. - What happened? Got scared? How crazy are they? - Have your tea. - Thank you. Did you have tea? Yes, I did. You'll be feeling cold. No, no. Sitting near this is warm. Have it. - Thank you. - OK, OK. OK, How many times? How many more Rotis needed? That's what they do to get rid of the cold here. Thulsa always speaks about you. She doesn't even think of us when you're around. Faiza, take care of Thulsa. She doesn't give a second thought to anything. In my opinion, she is very brave. Yes, yes, she... Your support is what makes her brave. You rightly said it. She is very naughty with us. What's happening here? Whom are you talking about? Wow! Faiza, You learnt to make Roti in such a short while? It's amazing. See, Excuse me, pencil please? Thank you. - Yes, Faiza. - Sir, sorry, sir. Did I trouble you calling at late night? No way, tell me. Just one doubt; Can we use videos for seminars? Why not? You can. Yes? Great, great. Thank you, sir. Thank you so much. OK. Are you tensed? Yes, a little. This is my first time presenting a seminar in such a big university. Seminars are very common here. You needn't get tensed. OK, sir. Thank you, sir. I'll see you tomorrow. - OK, good night. - Good night, sir. - Grandpa, - Yes, kiddo, I'm preparing for the seminar. - Let me just read out the points? - Yes. The biggest advantage of the first war of Independence, 1857 was the establishment of Hindu-Muslim unity. The British was threatened by it. Lord Curzon was their trump card to breakdown this unity. His policy was to 'Divide and Rule'. One second. The Bengal Split and Pakistan formation were the fruits of that policy. Lord Curzon died in the year 1825. The repercussions of his policies are evident in Indian politics even now. It divides us again and again in the name of religion. We have to understand that all these are for gaining power. Abdur Rahman Sahib, known as the Heroic Son of Kerala is one of the leaders of renaissance who stood against it. He was tortured both by the extremists belonging to his own community, and the British rulers, for the very same reason. Pampering their memories at heart will definitely provide us the strength to face the challenges of today. But deliberate attempts are being made to obliterate them. Even new historical narratives are being constructed for this purpose. Resistance is crucial for the survival of our country. The stories of those people who sacrificed their entire lives in the names of clans and tribes to which they are born are extremely saddening. Some people are conspiring against freedom, democracy and secularism. Won by heroic sons of our land like Abdur Rahman Sahib. To safeguard the freedom and unity of our land, we must resist and defeat these forces of darkness. Thank you. A political speech in the name of seminar? Ridiculous! We should never be a mute witness to this absurdity. What Deepthi said is true. People from our place are the haughtiest. These are the recruits of Pothuval. Everyone has a stand. There is no need of complaining anyone. We shouldn't allow such anti-nationalists here. We ourselves will do whatever is necessary. True. The system is not going to change for better. Even if we go and complaint, what is the use? Hey, Faiza Madam, greetings. I got to hear your seminar. It was fun. Open your ears, and listen. This is Hindustan. Evil or Virtue, We'll do it, understood? If you don't agree to it, just leave the country. Understand? Such a ridiculous seminar and research of yours. Faiza, Politics here is different from that of our native place. Here, we should be very careful while making statements. We're here with a warning just coz you're a Malayali too. They are Dare Devils. But, I didn't say anything that isn't there. Are you sure, you didn't? Dang. What did you say? She's saying that she only said the truth. What truth? Whose truth? Who told you that they are truths? You'd better respect our country and its culture, or else we won't sit quiet. - Bro, - Understand? - Bro, she's a kid. Leave her. - What kid? Go Faiza, quick. You may study if you want to. And don't dig grave for yourself. Faiza, Faiza, C'mon, be bold. Faiza, Amal is calling. Faiza, - Hello, Amal. - Why didn't you come to the square? Thulsa here. Where's Faiza? Er... Amal, she's here. But she's totally upset. The PVS gang? - Yeah. - OK. You ask her not to get upset. Tell her I'm coming to meet her in a bit. OK. This University has a good culture. It doesn't mean that we'll always stick to it. - You'd better not provoke us. - What did I do for it? Why the hell did you intimidate students in the name of politics? [Indistinct chattering] He initiated the problems. Haibi, take him away. [Indistinct chattering] Hey, act with decorum. Do you remember any such issue happening in the campus before? They initiated the problems. You'd better counsel them. We didn't do anything. He initiated the issue. That's OK. Sit, Hari. What the heck? See him. Faiza, You made a mess out of it, didn't you? Honey, couldn't you tell me, at least? I would've dealt it wisely. Or else you could've told them. I know it only when they told me. - Haris, we can't blame Faiza. - That's fine. She's new to this place. Didn't I warn you about your friends? Honey, your family is all tensed up. I somehow have managed to calm them down. Faiza, leave it. We'll handle the rest. You needn't bother it at all. You don't have to handle it. I know what you're saying, and what you're going to say. I'm not your puppet. Well, Haris, I heard how you calmed my family. Don't make me swear. See you later. OK, C'mon, let me say... She's in a bad mood. Hello, sir. How's your health? Are you fine? I'm alright. Just that I'm upset about my grand daughter. Oops, take it easy, sir. That's just a small quarrel between the students. We're here to support her. You don't have to get tensed. I'm positive about it. I know she'll not neck into unwanted things. Yes, true. Please hang on, I'll give the phone to Faiza. He's tensed. Yes, mom. Mom, don't get tensed for what others say. Still, when you hear many things... I hope you're calm now. - Call later. - OK. OK. OK mom, Peace be upon you. - And unto you peace. - Is it a serious issue? Thulsa, Thulsa, Get up. Your brother is calling you. Pick it. Hello, Yes, I was sleeping. What happened? Yes, I was sleeping. What? How? When did the accident happen? What is his condition now? Brother, my brother. Brother, Thulsa, My brother... Hello, hello, Thulsa's friend, Thulsa, My dear brother, In another event of Sawaj violence, one more person has been murdered in Bageshwar, Uttarakhand. A group of local goons beat a young man Vilas Chakma to death accusing him of killing cattles. Vilas Chakma reportedly used to skin dead animals and sell it to leather companies for his living. We're waiting for more details on the news. Yeah, we'll be there right now. Brother, My dear brother... Vilas is accused of stealing cows. He, who was beaten up from Utharakhand, was caught many times for stealing cows. When he got caught this time, he was slaughtering a cow. When the villagers saw him do this, they attacked him. Hello, 'Vilas is still alive' 'He lives in me', 'He lives in all of us', 'He's still alive', 'He lives in me', 'He lives in you', 'He lives in me', 'He lives in you', 'He's still alive', 'He lives in us', 'He lives in you', 'Vilas is still alive', 'He lives in me', 'He lives in you', 'He is still alive', 'Vilas is still alive', 'He lives in me', 'He lives in you', 'Vilas is still alive'. Friends, These people have been suppressing Dalit voices in this University for years. They were even pushing him to commit suicide. Now they have started murdering Dalit people in rural India. And why? For what reason, brothers? In the name of job, that they do for their living? In the name of job, that he had been doing for years? This is their master plan to split us. The dirty plan to split our country. And we cannot afford to be quiet, brothers. This is not happening anywhere else. But here and now. Vilas bro, who has given up his life for these fascists... He's not just Thulsa's brother. Vilas is a symbol for every Dalit in this country, for every minority community in this country. Brothers, these authorities are not going to find the culprits. They will protect them, praise them, worship them. So, let's not ask for whom the bell tolls. This is an attack on mankind, friends. As John Donne said, The bell is tolling for us. We're the last of us. Who all among us will remain? All of you were able to come here on such short notice. We're all that's left. Uncorrupted and Sane. So, unite and fight, we shall. Unite and fight, we must. So, say along with me, brothers. 'Shout out loud'. 'Stop Caste Discrimination'. 'Stop, stop'. - 'Stop Fascism.' - 'Stop Fascism.' Now, my brother Adharsh will talk to you. Friends, Like what Amal said, The attack on minorities and Dalits are going on in all directions. They try to suppress our voices. And when they fail to, they finish them off. How pathetic! Even Hitler or Musollini would be taken aback by our condition. Hey, what's happening in our country? Now they are onto us. Yesterday it was Rohan, Now, it's Thulsa. Next, you, me. Are we slaves? We're not slaves. We need to fight for our freedom to live freely in our country. In Our country. We aren't giving up to these fascists, are we? Are we? I need a 'No'. We need to sustain and retain what we achieved through the pain and struggle of our fore fathers. We are not scared of their bullying. - Am I right? - Yes. - Am I right? - Yes. - Jaihind. - Jaihind. 'Vilas is still alive'. 'He lives in me', 'He lives in you', 'He lives in all of us', 'He's still alive', 'Vilas is still alive'. 'He lives in you', I invite Faiza to talk to you for five minutes. Come on. Do it, Faiza, I... I don't know what to say... particularly. I mean, Amal, you... Whatever Amal said... In Hindi or English. English. I mean, whatever Amal said, and Adharsh said We know all that. I mean, we know all of that. But do we really know what happened? And he was doing his job. And some people, they just decided that he shouldn't live anymore. They just decided he shouldn't live anymore. I, I, It doesn't make sense to me. Doesn't... I'm sorry. I... Does it make sense to you? Does it? So, if they think that we don't know what they are doing to us. They are wrong. If they think that we're blind to what they are doing to us. They are wrong. We're not blind. And we will not let them win. We are not blind. We are not blind. Everyone, not let them win. We will not let them win. - We are not blind. - We are not blind. - We will not let them win. - We will not let them win. Say it along, 'Vilas is still alive', 'He lives in me', 'He lives in you', 'He lives in all of us, 'He's still alive'. Let's disperse, all. Vilas is Thulsa's brother. Thulsa is my room mate, so, Is it a fake case? - I'm sorry, what? - Is it a fake case? Aren't you ashamed to ask such a question? No, it's murder. Vilas death is real. But that can be fake case by you. You should be ashamed yourself. We've nothing to say to you. We're not going to give you bytes so that you can make money out of it. Get lost now. This is going out of our hands. We've to do something about it. This girl is becoming so famous these days. No it's murder. If we don't react, everything's going to get messed up. Sushil bro, See her adamance. You understand why she's here? Yes, ask now. Hey Amal, They are knocked down by Faiza's speech. All of them have gone mad. No wonder. How many did you say, 50,000? Bro, it's 52k likes since such a short time. And this is the biggest publicity we can ever get for our Fascist movement. That's true enough. Now itself, almost all the main channels had called asking for an interview with Faiza. But her family is bit concerned and tensed. We should consider that as well. True. Thulsa, I rang you up several times, but didn't connect. You do one thing. You take rest. Sleep. You'll feel fresh, then. We can talk afterwards. Faiza, I've to return today itself. What are you saying, Thulsa? I'm leaving campus for a while, Faiza. What are you saying? Mom has not come out of the shock. She just sits still. Somebody has to feed her. Sister-in-law, Even she is worried about what's going to be next? In this situation, how... how can I continue here? So, what about your research? I'll try to continue somehow. Thulsa, Aren't you a person who has a positive attitude to everything? Let's bring your mom here. And consult a doctor here. What you say? Everything will be OK. We're... We're here to support you. You're not alone. You understand that, right? Can't we do anything about it? Other than being passive like this? I feel that you should make your Anti-Fascist campaign a bit more aggressive. I mean, you should lift it up to different realms possible. That's true, Sir. Sir, what you say about using the possibilities of theater for this movement? Excellent. It's a Bollywood mood over here. If Pothuval sir give it a try, even our drama can be staged here. But, I wonder if we can recreate the street play impact here. To be frank, if we alter the play a bit, we can stage it here itself. Exactly. Great, if we could do it here. But, it's not going to happen in the proper way. No, there's an idea. Listen, How about our central character, a chieftain? Nope, that's a common pattern. Yes, true... but a chieftain himself is our problem now. What if he has a horn? Horn? Where? Let me see it? Look, Amazing. Nice. See, Nice, know? A strange being with a horn, and a hoof. Faiza, could you give a try writing the scenes of it? No way. How come me? You have a little experience in writing, don't you? Dare to write it. But, you need the dialogues in Hindi, right? That's OK. We'll translate it afterwards. Write, dear. Yeah, I'll try. - That's it. - Perfect. C'mon. Positions! This is My country. So, your culture, your customs, your beliefs are My choice. I decide on what you should know, and what you shouldn't, what you eat, and what you wear... I'm your master, and this is my stern order. Can you duck down a bit, and do it? I mean, can you bend down a little? We just have to stand still, right? Yup, just thought of not blocking them. It's you! They come later only. You have to keep the side, and bend a little. Faiza, congrats. Both the concept and the dialogues are amazing. I suggest if we could add more of visual elements, and reduce the dialogues where ever possible. That's just my suggestion. Director's decision shall be the final. Sir, I have already taken a few references. Very good. One second. Hello, yes... What? What is it, sir? Gauri Lankesh, the editor of Kannada Tabloid, Gauri Lankesh Patrike, who is also known for her criticism on religious politicism is shot dead by three men in Bangalore. The unknown assailants fired four bullets at point blank range. As she is saying out loud some bare truths, two strange figures having horns and hoofs appear on both sides of Gauri Lankesh. Full of zeal and zest, those strange figures vociferously approach Gauri Lankesh. Good morning, sir. Good morning, sit. They have lodged a complaint to VC, saying that this drama is Anti-National. Since this program is hosted by us, the VC forwarded it to me asking for a report on it. This is clearly an attempt by the Fascists to halt the play. We should somehow overcome it. Sir, how long have we been working for it? Yeah. We'll never abandon the play. Don't worry. OK. Then, there is an idea. You ask us for a copy of the script. And we submit it. You can file your report based on it. You mean a diluted script. That's enough. But, don't underestimate them. If you're there with us, we can face anything. Am I right, Faiza? Sir, the entire college supports us. So, we're not worried like that. - Let's see. - Yeah. - Thank you, sir. - Carry on. Sir, didn't you see it? This play is anti-national. And it is against an establishment even you are a part of. Moreover, the play was scripted by Pothuval sir himself. And VC has asked report from the very same person. Pothuval... he's the mastermind behind all these. The script they have given to the VC is fake. OK, OK, I'll discuss this with VC. We can find out a solution. Sir, This drama is officially banned inside the campus. Still, if they want to stage it, they would do it on the roads. Even then, the public would watch it. Sir, I can assure you one thing. If they stage the drama here, the campus will burn. That's for sure. C'mon. Good morning. - Namaste Pothuval sir. - Namaste. - How are you? - Namaste. He is party's District Chief in Delhi. - Namaste Pothuval. - Namaste. Sir, did we ever trouble you? Why are You troubling us so much? What did I do? He's talking about the drama. What's wrong with the drama? What's the issue? This is an anti-national drama, sir. We won't allow this in the campus. Who are you to decide that? You're not a student in the campus. You're an outsider, right? Then how can you detect this to me? Pothuval sir, Sir, don't you belong to a good family? Then, why are you with such naive students? So, that's the thing. Since I'm from a good family, I should keep my eyes shut at the crimes committed by nobles. Am I right? Talking about nobility and royalty, I'm the son of a great leader, who faced intimidation from nobles for unveiling the crimes they did. Better make your leader know of it. Such a show-off. You're a professor. And that is why we were giving you respect till now. But we understood that it is of no use. Listen, no matter you go any extent against our country, we will be there to watch over it. Hereafter, we will not talk, but show it through our actions. Who did you say he is? District Chief. Just make him understand that not even a National Chief, superior to him can move Pothuval. Otherwise, I can say it myself. Listen, Not your Party office is paying me salary. Here comes big-wig nationalists. When hundreds of leaders were dying for India's Independence, You were licking the boots of British. Is it the nationalism you're talking about? Is worshiping the murderer of our Father of Nation called Nationalism? Stop your blabbering. Get lost. He's speaking too much. We'll strike back later. As an Anti-National content has been noted in the above mentioned drama, its performance presentation has been forbidden and banned in the university. Everyone at campus now, knows that our drama has been banned. So, making it happen is our prestige issue. I don't think we can make it. We will do it for sure. I don't think we can do the rehearsals here. Yeah. We'll have to find another place for it. I can arrange it. - OK. - Are you sure? Yes, don't worry about it. So, that means, we're continuing with the drama, right? - Yes. - Let's face it all. - Definitely. - Will see. One second, relax, relax. Amal, where are you right now? I called you many times. I'm in between the rehearsals, Sir. Here, the network is not proper. Is there any problem? Yes, Amal, there are some problems. What they are trying is not to confront you on political terms, but to kill your confidence by mentally torturing you. What happened now? Faisa is their target. For them, she's a prey who doesn't deserve any kind of consideration. They are moving things to get Faisa arrested. Arrest? What are you saying? She must do something if at all they have to arrest her. These days, even innocents can get arrested. She's alleged to have chanted anti-national slogans. This is a fabricated case.. But, they must not get hold of Faisa at the moment. We must hide her somewhere. Faisa must be protected at any cost. I have sent Adharsh to you. OK! OK, Sir. - OK. - Bye. Amal, stick to the by roads. Get in. - Faiza, cover your face. - OK. Let's go. A case has been filed against a student from University campus accusing her of treason. The Delhi police registered the case against Faiza Sufiya, a Malayali who is doing research at University campus accusing her of treason. What's going on? - Come inside. - Yeah. - Come. - Namaste. - Sit. - Come, please sit. I'll get you something to drink. I could accommodate her in my house. But, you know Padmakumar, right? Yes. His camera is always watching us. Yeah, I know. Pothuval sir told me everything. You seem to be too tired. Take a shower, and you will feel fresh. See, I've kept the towel and soap here. Tell me if you need anything else. Don't worry dear, Your family will accept this in the course of time. How do you know Gazal Raza? We met at a function. Bincy, you come here. Let them take rest. OK then, good night. - OK. - Good night. Faiza, you freshen up. I'll be there outside. Amal, What happened? I want to make a call home. What's the big deal? Take it. Thanks. I'm outside. Nadira, you have a call. Hello. Mom. Faizu, my daughter... What all things I'm hearing about you? Don't you know me? This is a fake case. Police had come here too. Faizu, what is it that we can do? Mom, don't worry. There are a lot of people here taking care of me. The professor has arranged an advocate too. Everything will settle in two days. I'll meet you thereafter. If Allah wills. We haven't hurt anyone. So, god will save us. I'll call you later, mom. OK. - Thanks. - How are things at home? Sit. Everyone OK? It's worse. Police had visited my house. I was expecting it. Until today, that was a home of a freedom fighter. But now, that is a house of a traitor. Grandpa, Faiza, what crap are you saying? You yourself know that this is a fabricated case. The video of you shoving off the Public TV reporter got viral. They were humiliated by it. This case is just a revenge for it. We have with us, the original footage that exactly prove what our protest and slogans were. We can easily prove it in the court. For now, you shouldn't get caught. That's all. But, how long...? Like this? Faiza, It's just a matter of 2-3 days. Venugopal, the advocate picked up by Pothuval sir is one of the senior lawyers in Delhi. Moreover, he's an activist too. He's handled numerous cases of this kind. He'll be able to help us out. All these years... The protection I received from my family, was my strength. But now... I feel weakened. Buddy, Hope you know that you're not alone. Faiza, good morning. Good morning. Amal, Amal, Good morning. Good morning. Have your tea. Thank you. Faiza, It's the lead news in media today. Faiza's issue. That too with her photo. We need to do something immediately. Otherwise... things will go out of our hands. Oh, god. Sir, we're going to a nearby place. Take off your Burka. Remove it. Can't you hear me? OK, go. Faiza, I don't think it's safe to travel anymore tonight. Listen, what about we stay here tonight? Get down. Come. What's wrong? Can I get some drinking water? Uncle, Do you have some drinking water? Yes. I have. - Will you drink tea? - That's cool. Tea is ready. Have it if you wish to. OK, thank you. Our campus is stirred up over Faiza's issue. They completely support us. What about our drama? That's not our priority for now. That's not it, Amal. We must stage the drama at any cost. Otherwise... it would be like an absolute surrender. After fighting so much... There is no word 'Surrender' in our dictionary. It's equivalent to giving away the entire University to them. Pothuval sir had called 2-3 times. He has moved for an anticipatory bail. I'll have to go and meet him tomorrow. I'll come back soon. Mom... mom, What's wrong? What's wrong? Mom... Amal, would they hurt my mom and grandpa? This is a criminal case registered under Sections 124 A, 141, 142 and 146. It's a bit difficult to get anticipatory bail for such cases. We have with us, the original footage of Slogans. Can't we present it in the court? Yes, we can. Sir, Faiza is highly secular, moreover... Her enemies are those extremists belonging to her own community. But, what the court needs is Proof. Sir, Faiza is a person who unfailingly posts her opinion about various social issues on Facebook. You can very well understand it from her FB posts. We can present all these at the court at the time of hearing. But, can't say how far it is helpful for getting the anticipatory bail. Anyways, let me talk to Venugopal sir. I'll do my best. Thank you, sir. Thank you. So, let's leave? OK. Thank you. Sir, he talks as if he lacks confidence. We can't blame him, Amal. This case is more serious than we think it is. Get the documents signed from Faiza, and bring it here now itself. I'll do it now itself, sir. I've an important meeting now. - Adharsh, you join me. - Sure. - I'll be back. - Thanks dear. Rohan, l'm leaving. We've just 4 days left for our drama. There's no problem at all. We'll make it happen. On the very same day as decided. We'll manage to get the bail before that. And listen, You must take care of the pending works regarding costumes. - OK? - Fine. And you should continue with the rehearsals. Please fix all the problems as needed. I must finish some work immediately. Be back soon. Sure. Faiza, - Where had you gone? - To a nearby place, why? Police took away our dad and the girl with them. What are you saying? When...? Some time back. - Where is the police station? - It's nearby, please inquire. Sir, just a minute. Hello Sir, I'm Amal. - Didn't you bring any girl here, today morning? - No. From under the Lohapool bridge. She carried a backpack, name is Faiza. No, no, no such person was brought here. I inquired at the other police station, they told that she would be here. No brother, don't waste time. No one was brought here. OK, Thank you, sir. - Hello, - Amal, I'm waiting here at the hotel, Queens. Faiza's grandpa will be here in a while. Amal, you come here with the documents signed by Faiza. We'll meet him first, and then move to advocate's office. Sir, there's a problem. I... I shall explain it there. What's it? What's the matter? Sir, Faiza... When I got back, she wasn't there at the place I left her. Amal, what are you saying? A lady over there said that, she was taken away by the police. Please come. Where's my Faiza? She'll be here in some time. Till then, you can take rest here in a room. Which group do you belong to? Tell the truth, who sent you here? Which group do you belong to? You'd better confess everything. We'll soon present you in the court. You'll get bail too. Then you can meet your family. Otherwise you'll never get back to them. I hope you understood. Don't act up. What's your intention? It was my dream since childhood of pursuing my studies and research here. That's only why I'm here. And I wanted to be on Abdur Rahman Sahib. Abdur Rahman Sahib, who's that? No idea. The country doesn't even know his name. And you've come here to do research on His life? You can pursue this in your village. What is this all about? How long since you know him? He, who protects the nexalites and terrorists of the place helped you go into hiding. Am I right? Come on. Sir. How many years since you know her? I've told you several times that I don't know her. I'm telling you again I don't know her. You're lying. Sir, sir, please don't thrash him. - We know everything. - Please leave him. - Shove off. Make him also understand. Why are you smacking her? Coz you people are liars. Don't act innocent. You yourself chose your destiny, isn't it? We'll make your life difficult. What's the matter? Sir, I'm Rajeev Menon from Venugopal Associates. He's Mr.Mussaliar. He's from Kerala, and he has a complaint, Show me. Sir, Your police illegally arrested my grand daughter. I want to meet her. Sir, he came all the way from Kerala only to meet her. Sorry, sir. We haven't arrested any such person. Our records say it all. Go ask her friends. Who knows, she might have ran away with her lover. Girls these days are like that. Sir, sir... please, Sir, this took place within your police station area. And you're duty bound to conduct an inquiry into this and accept my complaint. Don't waste my time. Get out. Sir, I'm not here for taking any favour from you. This place is about Law and Order. That is why I'm telling you. Please understand your responsibility and do your duty. Don't you have to teach me my duty. Who the hell are you? Show me your identity card. C'mon, take out your ID card. Show him the ID card. Sir, he's a freedom fighter. Hey sir, please sir, - Get out, will you? - Sir, what are you doing? Son of a dog, I'll put you behind bars. - You'll never see the world outside. - Playing with Delhi police, huh? He's such an old man. Take him out, will you? If you dare mess up with police... Read the news once in a while. I'll call you back. Please don't disturb him, he's so tired. You can ask questions, but don't disturb him, please. What do you have to say about Faiza? - See, see, the fact is, - When did you speak to her last time? See, the police arrested her. The police arrested her... Now, but, they're denying that they have not arrested her. No one is missing here. She has been arrested. But, he's denying that she has been arrested. See, he's a freedom fighter. He has the right to see her. He's asking that where is she? That's the treatment a man like him is getting. What happens to regular people who're walking to a station? And we have taken... We've proof. We have the original video with us. You... you've to search and find her. Hello, sir. Hello. Have you arrested the girl? We'll not move from here, until and unless we know the truth. If at all you've arrested the girl, you should've presented her at the court immediately. What is this? Are you taking the law into your hands? If not..., you'll have to arrest us also. Please, please, please. See, see, see, see, Ms.Faizal Sufiya is in our custody. We will produce her in the court. Faiza, We're going to produce you in the court tomorrow. Don't think you can talk crap there. Remember that you're coming back here itself. We've been very friendly with you so far. Let her take bath and freshen up. We need to take her to the court. Get up, Faiza, hello... The charges against the accused, Faiza Sufiya is anti-national activities, and today she has been brought to the court... They will delay it to the maximum. Faiza Sufiya is being brought to the court today... Will she get bail or not? Everyone is anxiously waiting to know about it. Grandpa, Faizu, Hearing is over. The verdict will come at 4.00 pm. Let's wait. Hope for the best. Amal, no problem there, right? We're almost set. OK. Oh, it's tight for me. - Let's go? - Yes, quick. The University has banned the drama. Police will not let it happen, We should make sure that they have all our support. Will the audience be quiet? Anyways, we will plan everything. What you say? Gandhi. Nehru. Tagore? Oh, Vivekanandji, Ambedkar. By the by, who's this? Who is this? What? Oh, Kalburgi. Good. Kalburgi. Well, all the celebrities come here. Now, note your name, sign, and remove your fancy dress. And take your positions there. Just open it. Ashok Sir, We are lucky people. Being able to spend a night with such great people is definitely a matter of luck. Dear ones, I apologize for not being able to stage the drama. Weak people always fear others. They even engage in bullying. Being the victims of Fascism, our drama crew and actors, are behind the bars now. Only a few of us escaped their notice. I'm Vilas Chakma. Your college mate Thulsa Chakma's brother. I'm a black. I skin dead animals for my living. I eat them to suppress my hunger. I bury the stinking dead bodies of animals. I facilitate public hygiene. Whipping scars, made by the nobles just bulge out of my back. Hey, stop. Police has come, C'mon. Stop, you stop there. Stop there, I say. My death will hunt you down inside your palaces. My death will consistently boil over under your feet. My name is Vilas Chakma. They are the people who killed me. Move. Catch him. Catch him, catch... Catch him. Catch him. Adharsh, I'm Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi. Their bullets can't pierce into my chest. My life is my message. You're the Crown of Thorns of religion. You're the devil tooth of Varna system. You spit on the freedom we earned through a lot of sacrifice, and ordeal. Switch off the lights. Stop your drama. Leave me. They're strange beings with horns and hoofs, who savagely suppress freedom. - Catch him. - Leave me. Leave me. Catch him. They are the ones who slaughter freedom. Democracy will never forgive you. You should not forgive them. You'll surely get the answer for it. Leave me, I'll not do anything. [Indistinct chattering] I'm Gauri. You can kill me. But, you can't defeat me. I will expose the disgusting truths to the world through my writings. I will continue doing it. But, everyone of you sitting in front of me... Your silence make me scared. Your muteness makes me scared. Not only me... They will come in search of every one of you; to your kitchens, to your privacy, They will come, and destabilize you. Will you let that happen? Tell me, Will you let that happen? Tell me.
