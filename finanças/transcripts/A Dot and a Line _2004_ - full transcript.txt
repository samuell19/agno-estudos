Walk towards the squad car! Walk calmly to the squad car. Come on, come on! CONSCRIPTION CENTER VENEZUELA Good morning. I'm lieutenant Maria Cristina Fuenmayor Aguilar, head of the 15th Enlistment Office. I've been here for about two years and my mission is to do a good job in selecting those who in the future will serve the country. -Hey, my dear, look... -What do you mean, 'my dear'? It's Sergeant! Hey, Sergeant, look... come on, look, I'm the bread winner of the family, I'm an only son. My girl is pregnant, man. I'm trying to get my high-school diploma at night school and everything. And here between just you and me, don't tell anyone but I'm screwed my friend. I have a rare disease. Look, friend, let me go, come on. If you're that screwed up here, what are you going to do at home? Stay here, man. Come on, man. Let's talk about business. I'll slip you a little something, OK? To thank you and you let me go. What do you think? Look, go back to your place, because what you want can't happen. Now you won't get out of here even without money. There's a crisis on the border and no exceptions are being made. Move. -Shit, but... -Move! We're going to choose right now. So those I point must go where I indicate. You, to the right. You, in the yellow shirt, move! You. You in the red cap, let's go. You two... To the right! Lieutenant, my commander in the courtyard! Request permission to speak with you. Permission to continue with the personnel in the courtyard. -Permission granted. -Permission to withdraw. -Dad! -Hello, son, God bless you! Look, man. Why are they going to let him go and not me? You're Jane Doe's son. That means a dumb ass. What's more, you only have one surname, right? -Cheito! There he is! -Where? There he is! Cheito! Son! Cheo! -It's my mom... -Hey, don't break ranks! Hey, and that little beauty is your sister, yeah? You can't pull strings but you sure have a real tasty looking little sister there. If you play your cards right, we'll make an exception. Brother-in-law. Lieutenant, here we have a volunteer for the border! I'm not going to take revenge in this one. You will pay for this one to the guerrilla, the drug traffickers and the Colombians. To the border post, now! One, two... CONSCRIPTION CENTER COLOMBIA Volunteers to defend border posts, front and center! MORÓN RIVER - SOUTHERN COMMAND VENEZUELA Squad! Attention! Firm! Good morning, I'm first sergeant, Carrasco Velásquez, second in command of the Border Protection Base of the Southern Command. Across from us is the Morón River Colombian post. That's the enemy. I don't want any exchanges no friendships with those Colombians, understood? Understood, sergeant! We're on yellow alert... And there might be problems. Attention! Firm! At ease! You're at my captain's orders. Down there below, there's a point that's kind of an invisible line. But that line exists and says: Venezuelans don’t cross here! The point is here and it's this. From now, that is the symbol of the country. And the country is here, the country is in your hands! I'm ready, go. Thirty-one, my friend. Thirty-one, I won. But come here, man, we'll keep playing. I won, kid, give me my shit. But come here. You're going to leave us losing here? The cigarettes are mine and I'm taking them. -How much for me? -Give me twenty. And the watch? Give me ten then. Man, you are a crying baby. A little tobacco. Where are the cans? Bye, bye. Bye, bye. The force it has... who? The southern command! Five and I don't see you! You're really blind, brother. You can't even hit the ground. You had to be a stupid and a peasant. Good afternoon, Sergeant. Permission to give a letter to Pedro Peinado from the Páramo Los Rosarios. Thank you. Sergeant, permission to withdraw. Aren't you going to read it or what? No, sir. Peinado, you want to go back to your moorland, isn't that right? You want to make that very short trip and it'll be really cheap. One thousand pesos there and back. Do you want it? Lieutenant, permission to speak. Go ahead. There's drug trafficking in the camp. Sergeant Requena just offered me some drugs. All right, Peinado, go back to your target practice. But lieutenant, aren't you going to arrest him? I told you to get back to your target practice! Damn! MORÓN VILLAGE COLOMBIA OK, I don't want any problems later. Bye, man. Thanks for everything. Let's go, quickly. I have to go. OK, I'm bid three thousand. Who'll give me more than three thousand? Seven! -How much, how much? -Ten. -Ten here. -Fifteen. -Fifteen over there. -Thirty. -What? How? -Thirty. -What's your name? -Vicente. OK, Mr. Vicente offers 30. Who'll give me more than 30? Let's see. Who'll give me more than 30? Sold to Mr. Vicente for 30. Go there, my love, quickly. He won her, man. Hey, what's up my friend? What's up, man? How are things? Have you been waiting long? -A bit. -Here's yours, look. Let's see what you brought. -How nice? -Hey, man, they're exquisite. -You see? -They are really cool. Let's see how they fit. Put them on so that we can see how they look. All right, see? Quality. They fit on you, my friend. Let's see how they look on me. Wow, man! Wait. They look fabulous on you, hear? Now check this out. Hey, do they look good? Damn yeah! Look, booze, my friend! -This is from there, no? -Try that thing. How is it? It's super, isn't it? It's kind of good. Now, come here. This is the main course for lonely nights. What do you think? Wow, you've outdone yourself, man. Pure tits, ass and other things. -Outdone yourself, brother. -Check this. Oh, those girls! Gorgeous! Cute ass. Wow! OK, give me my stuff because I have to leave. Here you are, that's also from the good batch. -Yes, or what? -Yes, it's great. Yeah man, quality stuff. OK, and the map? The map. Who would have the guts to leave this mess too, Cheito. But someone has to stay and fight this damn war, brother. So, always by the river, right? And then in three days, I'll be in Las Minas? And the boat? Look for it in El Sapo, near some dry poles there. Be careful, brother. Because if the guerrilla, the drug traffickers and paramilitary forces don’t get you, either your army will get you for deserter or we will get you. See ya and don't worry, you won't even see the dust. I need six volunteers for a reconnaissance patrol in the jungle. Step forward! I repeat, step forward! You didn't want this trip today. But I'm still going to give it to you and it might not be round trip. Peinado! Come on, move it! Come here, forward! Come here, forward! Understood, Sergeant. Move, move, let's go! Fuck! Look, look! Look that chick. Hi, honey, why don't you come here? I got something for you here. Don't kill me, man, don't kill me! You're not from the Southern Command, are you? Shit man, that's good... No, no, my man. Take it easy. All I want is water, take it easy! Lead is what's I'm going to give you, motherfucker. Lead! Because I'm going to make you pay for the five men you gunned down at the river, do you hear me? What five men, man? Are you crazy? Don't play stupid with me, you bastard. Don't play stupid! I was there. I was there but I managed to make it through, understand? I didn't die so that I could get revenge. No! Look, man. I'm not a guerrilla fighter. Look, I'm a Venezuelan soldier. Do you understand? Let's see. Southern Command, Southern Command... do you see any sign of that? Do you see insignias here? I don't see badges, I don't see a flag. I don't see a damn thing. Look, brother, I swear it. Believe me, it's just that I'm a deserter, you see? I fled the army, man. That's why I don't have any badges or insignias. Understand? You're a deserter. Yeah, man. Let me get a bit closer, I'm freezing. What's that, my man? No, no, you're not going to put that on me. No way, no. No, man, no. Here you have... Here you have your guerrilla badges, look. Look, look. Your guerrilla badges. Hey, look man, a farm. We're saved. Look! There have to be people here. What the hell is this, friend? Hey man, this thing is plastic. Do you see? What happened? What happened? Can't you see it is camouflage so that you can't see that it has something to do with drugs? It's a drug trafficker's camp. They must have food. Keep going, keep going. Hey man, come here and help me roll a "joint", friend! It's the pants, it's because of the pants? It's the pants, it's because of the pants? Ready. Where are my pants? Here they are. Pants and a shirt, keep that. What? This? Keep it hidden and don't say anything. What are you doing there, brother? Don't be a bastard. Can't you see she's a child who doesn't even have tits. Get to work, that's what you're being paid for! Stop or you're done for! Over there! Come on spread those legs, spread 'em! A marihuana plant, no? Easy, Luisito, he is a goddamn guerrilla fighter. Listen, let's see what the hell are you doing here in the camp? Why are you so worse for the wear? Well, because... well, we exchanged fire with some Colombian command soldiers and killed five of those bastards. Yes, we heard. You really gave it to them, right? Yes, no, no... we broke them. Great. Listen, come on. Your people have probably given you up for dead. The radio is shot to hell, but they'll fix it tomorrow. Come on. Look, brother, not only the Colombian army, no, wait a minute, we have the Venezuelans scared too. They're scared shitless, my man. Listen, very scared and everything else you want but that accent of yours is a bit strange there. Where are you from? Me? What, what, what do you mean where am I from? Guess. No, no, that accent isn't even remotely Colombian. Don't be stupid, Luisito, can't you see that the commander is from the coast? Right, commander? Listen, the commander is from the coast of Barranquilla. You're right, you're good when it comes to accent, right? Of course I am. From Barranquilla, the coast. Commander Cheito, form the coast. Let's drink to that, man! Cheers, shit! Don't invent stupidities, Colombian! I'm going to escape. I'm getting out of here. I don't even know why you haven't betrayed me? But I can't stay here any longer. Come here. What's the beef? You have work here, my man, a job and food, so what's the problem? Work? Work? Are you nuts? You know what they have me doing here? Do you or don't you? -They have me planting coke! -Shut up, damn you! Let me go! They have me planting that goddamned plant. That's what I'm doing. You call that work? Look, you son of a bitch, you guerrillas say that you're going to do away with the rich so that we'll all be equal, right? I'm going to tell you one thing: if there is something I don't want it's to be like you murderers and criminals. You understand? Because that's what guerrillas are... damned assassins. So if you want to finish me off, do it! But I'm leaving. You motherfucker aren't going anywhere. Come here, come back here. You're going to pay for the beating you gave me at the river, do you hear? -Let me go! -I’m gonna tell you something. I screwed all of your friends, I shot them all. I riddled all your pals with bullets. You cocksucker! What's up? Damn, Cheito... and you, what? It seems you're sort of AC-DC, you swing both ways, right? Don't you see that what they are is a pair of fags. Why don't you go play somewhere else? Good, isn't it? Great. Bon appetit. Look, you shit motherfucker, either you kill me or I kill you, understand? Look, man, if you plan to escape again, you Colombian bastard, everyone here will know you're a Colombian soldier. So, behave my friend, because if you don't, I'll have you shot myself, do you hear? Now go to your barracks, right now! Go to your barracks, right now! Go, now, goddamn you, move! Hey, there. How are you this morning. Bad mood, no? But a good roll in the hay, no? Listen, I should understand that you like the guerrillas. Let me tell you I was with them for six years. But, I went into drug running because it pays more. So that if you like guerrillas, here's one that can please you. Look, you bastard, I told you that I'm no faggot, you understand? If you keep fucking with me, I'll kill you. Easy. I won't bullshit you any more. But, if you change your mind... Man, don't waste time. Come, find me. OK? Bye. Good morning. I'm Cheito, Commander Cheito. Thanks. They might call again from your command at any time. Wait here. You know I had a girlfriend who had hair like yours. Yes? Abundant... Attractive... Solid. You know, when she let down her hair... she looked beautiful... Enticing. Tucán three, to major "L", over. Tucán three, to major "L", over. Tucán three, to major "L", over. Those are your people, answer. Tucán three, to major "L", over. Tucán three, to major "L", over. Tucán three, to major "L", over. Commander Cheito Da Silva, 11232835, over. Hello? Ma'am. Your radio is screwed. Where did you get this? And these boots? Who gave them to you? Talk, damn you! Where did you get those boots? Come on, talk! Where did you get those boots? And this? Did he come with on of you or what? No. Get up and come here. Where did you come from? Who hired you? Talk or I'll beat it out of you right here. You're a soldier, right? Talk, you son of a bitch! Yes! I'm a Colombian soldier. Soldier from the Colombian Northern Command. I'm not a drug runner, not garbage like you. Fag! I fixed it, coast man. Do you want it? Tell me something. Did your girlfriend's hair look like this? Yours is better. Let me go. Tucán three, to major "L", over. Tucán three, to major "L", over. We have to answer the radio, that's your people. No, it's better if you leave those people alone. Give me more. Come on, give me more. Tucán three, to major "L", over. Tucán three, to major "L", over. Tucán three, to major "L", over. Tucán three, to major "L", over. Commander Cheito does not exist, he is not one of us. Commander Cheito does not exist, he is not one of us, over. So you're police, damn you! Wait, Anita, I'll explain it to you, babe. Wait, baby, I'll explain it to you. You're going to explain it to St. Peter. Careful, careful with that! Careful with that flame, that flame, careful! Bring water quickly, Ana Maria is burning. Go! Hot Ana Maria, isn't she? Shit, Colombian, thank God it's you, my friend. Hey man, someone hit me over the head and tied me up here. Release me, Colombian, please, quickly. I don't kill you because I want you to suffer. You're going to pay for massacring my companions and for the narcs. You betrayed your country and your country will make you pay for it. What country, what the hell! You think the country cares about two assholes like us? They'll give you a medal for this shit, you idiot. You and I are cannon fodder, pal! The government owns this. They're one and the same. Don't be stupid! Look... I'm not with the guerrilla. I invented all that about commander Cheito so that they wouldn't discover us, but I'm not with the guerrilla. Let me go, pal. You and I are on the same boat. I don't care whether you are a drug trafficker, a guerrilla or a deserter. You... you're a piece of shit without any shred of honor. I'm garbage and what are you? You're a poor asshole. They took you out of the moors to have you lick the boots of a few generals who are all into contraband and you still celebrate that! I wasn't recruited. I signed up to serve my country. You volunteered? You asked to be in the army and all that? Shit, my friend, you sure as hell are stupid. What happened, man? That isn't a military helicopter. My guess is that it's the drug traffickers. Keep going. What happened? These boots are mine, man, what happened? Take it easy, take them then, take them! What the hell happened here? It was a fire, boss, almost everything burned. Of course, asshole, I can see that, but why did it burn? We thought it was one of the guerrillas, commander Cheito, a coast man, who was with Ana Maria when the conflagration began. Who? What's this commander Cheito like? A guerrilla fighter who took part in the Morón River fight. Ana Maria, where is she? She burned to death in the lab fire. And that commander you spoke of, do you have him? He escaped, boss. We had an agreement with the guerrilla movement. Now they're going to pay. Rebuild the camp, immediately! And what's going to happen to the guerrillas, boss? I'll take care of that! OK, everybody get to work. Get with it, get with it! -What happened, man? -Shush, shush. It's too quiet here. That's unusual. Not even the birds are signing. There's no sound, nothing. Motherfucker, that's for the kick in the face, understand? And that's for being a patriot. And I'm not with the guerrilla movement. They're a bunch of assholes! Don't move, pal. Because we assholes are really good shots. Over there, idiot, over there! Permission, commander. Commander. And who are these? Well, commander, I don't know, but we caught them in the jungle. What were you doing in the jungle. Talk, now! Mutes? So you're deaf and dumb. A pair of deaf and dumb fags. Quiet! I have a feeling that you're either CIA or DEA, which? No, no, look, commander... take it easy, take it easy. Look, we're just a pair of poor suckers. This guy is a Colombian soldier and I'm a deserter from the Venezuelan army. So this is the Liberation Army. Does this look like the Gran Colombia to you or what? Do you know what I think? I think you two are part of that joint operation by the Colombian-Venezuelan armed forces. What it's for? To annihilate the Rebel Liberation Movement. I'm a soldier from the Colombian Northern Command and this one's a guerrilla! I'm no guerrilla! Commander, I'm a deserter from the Venezuelan army. Miranda State, capital? What? Miranda. Miranda? Capital? Petare? Wrong, wrong. Either you're stupid or you're not a Venezuelan. Or all cops are stupid? No, no, look, I am a Venezuelan, listen: all right, enough, enough. Don't torment me any more. That anthem won't help you any. When in doubt, get to the bottom of things. To my way of thinking you're either CIA or DEA. Put them on ice, pals. We'll shoot them tomorrow. No, commander, hold on, it's true! We're DEA, we're DEA, but don't kill us. Look, why don't you exchange us for guerrilla prisoners? Just a second. We're perfect for a trade and worth a shitload of money. Do you get my point? Shut the fuck up already you asshole and stop inventing! The dead are business... the dead are business so that they learn once and for all that they shouldn't send babies into this area. Take them away. Wait, hold on, so what's the problem, man? It's true, we're from intelligence... Get over there. It's obvious, it's obvious! Why couldn't you keep your big mouth shut? Why? Why did you have to say that we are with the CIA? Why are you so stupid, you son of a bitch! Someone had to do something, man. But you just stood there like without saying a word and because you didn't back me up, they're going to kill us. Now do you realize that I'm not with the guerrilla? Now do you understand that I didn't snitch on you in the drug runners' camp? Go on, answer me! -Now I understand, asshole. -That's no use to me now. They're going to kill us anyway, you miserable bastard. -What are you saying? -I’m praying, stupid. What for, do you think that God will come to save you, you asshole? Stop cursing! Look, come here dumb Colombian, listen to me! Listen to me! That cretin didn't even take the trouble to come here to save his Son, you idiot. Christ was his son, wasn't he? And yet you believe that he'll come to save an idiot like you and an asshole like me. Listen, idiot. Christ died on the cross for the sins of the world. Understand? To save people like you, cretin! So shut up and stop blaspheming already. Why me? What sin did I commit? Why are they going to kill me? Why are they going to kill you? You're nothing but an old fart, tell me why? What's going on here? Commander, commander... Look, commander... I want to be a guerrilla fighter. I was a communist, a rebel, one of those masked troublemakers at the university. Come on, man. No, no! By the power vested in me by the country, we are going to execute these two infiltrators. On your mark, steady... it's your fault, Colombian. And yours, too. Take aim! The war is over, my friend. In hell we will be friends, won't we? Yes, but I hope in heaven? And these goddamned drug-traffickers what are they doing? Take cover! I didn't feel nothing. Are we dead? Run, fag, run! We're saved, Pedrito! We're saved, friend! Look, it was a miracle! It was God who gave us a hand and saved us. It was because of your prayers, I owe you one! You're going to be my friend, my pal, do you hear? Listen to something I have to say, if we get out of this, if we escape, you'll be my friend. Did you hear me? And truly, man, please, forgive me for everything bad I've done. For hitting you, for the opossum, for the boots, and everything else. Go on. -No, wait, look. -What? Those boots are mine so give them here, now! No, my feet are really hurt, those boots aren't yours. -Let go! -Give me back my boots. Stop, halt! Who goes there? Hey, Sergeant Carrasco! -Soldier, secure the perimeter. -It's me, Cheito. What the fuck are you doing here Da Silva. And who's this? Check him out! No, Sergeant, I was at the river, you see, and I was going to return to the command post and then suddenly I came across this guerrilla, so I killed five of them and brought this bastard back to you as a prisoner. That's a lie. I'm not a guerrilla fighter. I think we should get rid of this dog right here and now. No, Sergeant, don't kill him. Beat him, but don't kill him. That fag doesn't have mourners, kid. No, sergeant, wait, come here and let me tell you the truth. Look, this guy is a Colombian soldier. I told you he was with the guerrilla movement because he beat me a lot but he isn't with them. Don't kill him, just let him go. Better like that. Things are bad with Colombia and I think there's going to be a war. So we can take care of this one first. Shit, don't kill him I said, damn! Don't push my gun away, Da Silva. You're a deserter and you can't fool me. I can bury you. If you rat on me I'll get back at you by planting drugs on you. So let him go, Carrasco. If you screw me with drugs, you know that both of us will go down. Because you'll be marked as the one who sold it to me. And you buy it from me, I don't have anything to lose my friend. If you kill him, you're fucked, Carrasco! Forward march, soldiers! Then, I set fire to the drug traffickers' camp, Captain. That was the lab that was being patrolled by six armed guards, then, what did I do? I fired at them. Afterward, I grabbed a can of gasoline that was there and poured all over the packs of cocaine that were there. And captain, I didn't leave any of that poison that is rotting the brains of young people. Your name is bond, isn't it? What do you mean, Captain? Hell! You should be Cheito Da Silva Bond... James Bond. More dangerous than agent 007. What do you think, carrasco? Our own homegrown James Bond. So it seems, Captain. Prepare a report. Add what the Colombian did! Now! Look, look! Yes, baby, hello! That is divine, my little one. Come! Come for me, I'm all yours little one, that's it, come here! Look, daddy! For you! Oh, baby, I want your tits. That's good! Look how they show their tits. Look, look how nice. Oh, look, baby. Oh, fabulous. You fool, let's go there! This is yours, you lovely babe. Come here, love! Attention soldiers, we have a visit! Hey, what's up, what happened? Hey pal, come with is because with us there's more work. What crap is this? First, they come to the Colombian camp. -What for, pal? What for? -Because I damned feel like it. You get in there and leave this shit. -Why? I don't feel like it. -Because this is Colombia! -So you leave this shit. -I don't want to! -Throw me out then, throw me out! -Leave this shit right now! I saw her first, I saw her first. -What's happening here? -Nothing Captain, nothing. We saw them first. So first, for the Venezuelan army. Take them away! That's why, so what? You leave this shit! Are you leaving or what? Then it's like we said, Captain. The team that plays best and wins keeps the girls. Yes or no? All right. Heads or tails? Heads, Captain. Tails. Venezuela starts. Ready, Captain. Let the best team win. Let the best team win. Come on, come on! Goal! Shit! Goal, motherfucker! Goal, motherfucker! Off side, off side! Come here, come here. Say off side or I'm going to beat your ass. Off side, say it! Off side, off side! It isn't valid, it isn't valid! -Off side? What off side? -It isn't valid, it isn't valid! Stop, stop! That was a goal. That was my first goal, you damn son of a bitch. -Off side, off side! -That was a goal. Penalty, you bastard! No, it wasn't anything! Easy, men! Easy, it's OK. Easy. Cheito, get lost! -Come on, Captain, let me play! -Leave Cheito, get out! Easy, men! Let the game continue! Great, man. -Great. -What happened? Look, here. What? Let's see... -But is that pretty? -Of course. How great it is all perspired. How rich it looks all perspired. It looks too... Goal! You lost because you're sissies. Stupid. Slow. The fucking around ends here. Zero benefits! And shit from now on. Understood? -Understood, Captain. -Sissies! Where's Da Silva? Cheito Da Silva! OK, then girls, where's the other one? The pretty one? What happened, pal? Who won? Easy, easy, Pedrito, you don't even wear out that soap my friend. Besides, we were just talking, right, dear? Yes, he didn't touch me. See? You go back to the Colombian camp, now! Pedrito, I swear to you, I didn't touch her. If you want you can take her wherever you want. I swear, I really do. I'm not interested in her. I never had anything to do with prostitutes. I promised my girlfriend that I'd marry her and come pure yo out marriage. Because I'm a man of my word. Asshole! What's up man? Then you're not going to fuck her? Don't tell me you're a virgin, Pedrito? You can make fun of me. But I made a promise. I'm not making fun of you, Pedro. Shit, what I mean is... that's really weird. Damn, but I kind of think it's nice and everything. Pedro, come here, boy. You and I said we'd be friends if we get out of this jungle alive. Easy, Peinado. Peace! When I finish my stint in the army I'm going to marry her. -She's very pretty. -Divine, no? It's a pity I can't write to her to find out how she is. And why not? Because I don't know how to read and write. Shit! Not even the comics? I can't even read the letters she writes to me. Give them to me, Pedro, I'm the man. I'll read the letters to you, pal. I'll read this one. Páramo de los Rosarios. From Lutecia to Pedro. Dear Pedro... P-a... Pa... Papa. Is that OK? Look, pal, you really are dumb. Look, it isn't papa... like the potato you eat, it's papá or father. Like mother or father. Do you understand? Here, take it. No, I don't understand. And I'm going to forget about this because I'll never learn to read and write. And I'll never be able to write a letter to my mother, or Lutecia or anyone. Hey, take it easy, wait. Look... I'll write the letter to you and then you learn to read and write, you can write to them yourself, OK? -Are you sure? -Of course. -OK, then write this. -Go ahead. For Lutecia, now let's see. -Dear Lutecia... -Dear Lutecia... I always remember you and respect you. I want you to know that I imagine you stark naked. I dream of you every night and day when I will see you again. And I hope I will be able to fuck you six times a day. When I return to the Páramo de los Rosarios... -Páramo? Right? -Right? I promise you that as soon as I get to the moorland... I'm going to take you to the altar... because I, Pedro Peinado, will make you my wife. I'm going to put you on all fours. The politicians decided to send you to Caracas and Bogota as a way of talking about the alleged unity between neighboring countries. And that's because of the drug's lab and the guerrilla camp. So prepare yourself tomorrow. You and the Colombian will travel together. You'll be decorated. And will visit your homes. Is that clear? Yes. But why, Captain? To my way of thinking, something the two governments invented to give themselves time to prepare for war. They need symbolic heroes. And you are the chosen ones. Save a little bit for me. God bless you, my dear, I'm so proud of you. What's up man, congratulations! WELCOME CHEITO You were shitting your pants and don't tell me you weren't. What do you mean? Nothing, we grabbed him and took away the weapons of all those bastards and then we started shooting. And you are spitting at me here and everything, what's up? Hey mom, an umbrella for Wilson! Hey, pal, the cocaine is over. Listen to me! -What happened? -The cocaine is over. Shit, man, but what happened? You're like an electric vacuum cleaner. Let's do like we did the last time. OK, let's go then. -We're coming, hear? -I’m coming, careful there. No, no, where are you going? I'm going with you. What's up, man? We're going to control the drugs. Are you coming with us? You’re not. You’re still scared. Look at him, that's how he was that day. -Scared shitless asshole! -Stop it, stop it! Careful, yosmar. Hey, mom, I'll be right back! -Hey, mom! -Yes? I'll be right back. Let me change this beer because this is colder. As cold as a seal's ass, man! Hey, Pedro, do you have a girlfriend? No, I was kidding. Wait, wait. Wait a minute, so... Don't laugh. Let me ask you a question, your first time was with me? Don't laugh. Yes, with you. What happened? Well, I have to tell you something, Yosmar. You see... I told you that I don't have a girlfriend. But I lied. I do have a girlfriend. Her name is Lutecia and she lives there in the Páramo. What are you laughing at? -What's her name? -Lutecia. No, I gave her my promise and everything but... I like you so much. I'd like to reciprocate but... But... Cheito, Cheito. Get out, get out, Cheito's coming. Cheito's here. Get dressed! If he catches you here, he'll kill me. Hurry, hurry. Hurry, your shoes. Good, good. Bye, bye, bye! What's up? What happened, man, what are you doing up at this hour? It's the heat brother, I can't take it. I can't take it anymore. And since tomorrow we leave to Colombia, well, I thought that... I'd get up and prepare all this and be ready. And you? Are you all right? Yes. Yes, well. I'm going to the bathroom. And listen, you get ready. I don't want you to be late tomorrow. -OK. -Good. Bravo! Pedro! I'm sorry, but it's been such a long time since I saw you last. Don't worry. There's a lot of people. Yes. -What's up? -Come on! It's my friend Cheito, the one who helped me write the letters. -Hello, pleased to meet you. -Pleased to meet you. -Come here for the photo. -Go for the photo! Did you get the letters? Pedro didn't say those thing, right? You wrote that filth, didn't you? Pedrito, would you like a little more? Well, yes, thank you. Hey, it's really late, I'm going home, it's really late. -Let's go, grandpa. -No, let me accompany you. If you want to, I'll go with you man. No, anyway, I live nearby. In that house with the shingle roof. And you stay here with your guests. -Are you sure? -Sure, I'll take my grandfather. All right, Don Felix. See you later. Pedro? Pedro, is that you? And you, what are you doing here? I came for you. -Be really careful. -Take it easy, OK. Well, my love... it was wonderful to see you. Keep going. What's up, Luis? How's the team? MORÓN RIVER - SOUTHERN COMMAND VENEZUELA Shoulder, arms! Rest, arms! At ease! Gentlemen... While the politicians go about their symbolic posturing, we have to prepare ourselves here to shoot at the enemy that wants to take away our territory. I want to tell you that the party is over. None of you can have any type of connection with enemy soldiers. Understood? Understood, Captain! And you? Did you understand me? Understood, Captain. -I didn't hear you. -Understood, captain! Sergeant! Don't you want a drink? A drink, please. Lets see what my baby needs, a little bit of loving? Do I remind you of your mom or what? No, no, way. And then? Are we going or what? -Where? -To do a few little things. No, no, no, Miss. Forgive me but I don’t... You don’t what... Go, go to sleep. You’re going to sleep. -Don’t be an asshole! -Sleep, sleep, just a little. I wont do anything that you don't want to. Be still. -Go, go! -Just to sleep, OK? Just to sleep. -I don’t sleep with whores. -Come on! Shit, don’t call them whores! -Be careful of what you say. -Don’t be disrespectful, kid. -Go to sleep, go to sleep! -Come on. Stop your bitching, come on already. Get up, you Romeo. What happened? -Come on, man, quick! -OK. Come on, Pedro, move that ass, move it! I'm coming! You managed to get me to sleep with that girl, didn't you? Stop, you son of a bitch! Stop there, you bastard. Stop! You son of a bitch! You are going to pay me for this, motherfucker! -Thanks, friend. -Bye then. -Bye, Rigoberto. -Bye, bye. Come on, pedrito, come on. Let's see. Whats this? No, I found that. What are doing with Lutecia's chain? -No, I found it, asshole. -Oh, yes? You found it? I saw how you were looking at Lutecia in my house. You fucked her, you bastard! Hell, I didn't do anything! Shit, OK! I slept with her, I slept with her! And what's more, I wrote her in a letter that you wanted to fuck her. But because you’re so stupid, she knew I had written it and not you. You, stupid moorlander! Oh, really? Stupid moorlander? Well, for your information, I fucked your sister, asshole! Yosmar Coromoto? As if you have more sisters, you fag! You fucked Yosmar Coromoto, you bastard? Yes. You bastard! Motherfucker! Shit, motherfucker! You goddamned dog! Get up, you fag! Pedro? My pal, get up! Look, you sissy, I didn’t want to kill you. Get up, pedrito, I didn't want to kill you, pal, hear that? -Now I'm going to kill you! -No, pedrito, no! Yosmar wasn’t a virgin. What the fuck! Well, I wasn't the first one she had sex with. Goddamned whore, just wait until I see her, damn! Don't call her that, Cheito. Don't call her that, she's your sister. And besides, I want to marry her. Well... What a mess, no? We're going to end up as family. -I don’t know. -Come on, brother-in-law. Shit! What are you doing with a Venezuelan? Don't you know hes the enemy? Easy, Sergeant, we're not at war. We're on the verge of one and it starts right now. You bastard! Easy, Sergeant. Easy, Cheito, easy! -Easy, Sergeant. -Stop! Go, bastard, before I regret what I'm doing, go! Easy, easy, good. Go, you idiot, go! Keep going! Platoon, right face! Pick up equipment! All to the truck, lets go! Let's go! Move! Fire! Steel eagle, Head eagle, over. Steel eagle, Head eagle, do you copy? We are facing superior forces. I have ten men down, I need air support. It's urgent! Peinado! Shoot that shit, Peinado! Shoot that shit, Peinado! Shoot, Da Silva! Shoot, goddamn you! Fire that thing! Fire that thing, Peinado! I owe you one, pal. You're going to be my friend, my pal, do you hear? Listen to me, if we manage to get out of this, you'll be my friend, did you hear me? And truly, man, please. Forgive me for everything bad I've done. For hitting you, for the opossum, for the boots, and everything else. Go on. -No, wait, look. -What? Those boots are mine so give them here, now! -No, no, those boots aren’t yours. -Let go! Pedro, this shit is mine, give them to me! Hand over those boots, Pedro. Give them to me! Let go, they're not your boots!
