DEFEAT, HATE AND REVENGE RULE THESE UNCERTAIN TIMES... IN THE FERTILE BORDER AREAS, NOBODY IS ABLE TO ENFORCE THE LAW... Jeremiah. Jeremiah Pitt. (Chuckles) Hello, Captain. What can I do for you? Jeremiah. What's the matter? Something gone wrong with your memory? - Don't you recognize me? - Yeah, I'm good. We met in Mexico. Seven or eight years ago. If I'm not mistaken. So much has happened since then, you know. Who can remember everything and everybody? How about a drink or two, Captain? (Knife banging on table) Are you going back to Mexico? Oh, I'm heading south. Is there a town around here where I can sleep tonight? There's Membres. It's about the closest place. Though they don't have much of a hotel there. (Captain) Membres? I used to know someone who lived in Membres. I think his name was Brown. Montgomery Brown. But they called him Ringo. Maybe you know him. Montgomery Brown? Of course I do. Or I used to. But he's been gone a long time now. As soon as the war broke out, he enlisted and went away. No one knows what happened to him. (Captain) He never came back? He was married, if I recall, correctly. Maybe his wife would like to talk with someone who remembers her husband. She might even know of a place where I can spend the night, if I can't find a hotel room somewhere. Mrs Brown's name is Hally, isn't it? (Knife banging) Who were these two and what did they have against me? They worked for Paco Fuentes. Or they did. He and his brother took over the whole town when gold was discovered around here. They say it's Mexican territory, and no one wants to tell them any different. And what happened to Hally? Peace. I need some herbs. It's for a sick friend. You said it was for a friend. You can keep your money. (Ring clangs on floor) (Sign creaks) (Gunshot) (♪ Spanish song plays) (♪ Music stops) There's somebody lying out in the street. Looks like he needs help. The only help he needs at this point is a pine box. Hey, you! Where are you from, indio? The mountains. Looking for a job? Not today. I've already eaten. What are you anyway? Gringo? Indian? Or Mexican? That's his trouble! With all those men tramping in and out of his house, probably his own mother couldn't tell you! (Raucous laughter) Welcome to Membres, stranger. What kind of job did you want? Anything that's not too hard. Huh. Then just ask for the Fuentes. They're at the old Brown place. Now, they give the orders up there. If you know how to kill, they'll hire you right away. But I don't know anything about guns, Sheriff. Well, it's time you learned. And you better start carrying a gun. If you wanna live very long around here. Take my word for it. I know. Well, you look nice and healthy. So how come you never packed one? In my case, it's different. I'm not a Mexican. I'm an American. Hmm. An inferior race. And when you're inferior, you live much longer in Membres without a gun. (Dogs barking) What do you want? (Captain) Work. The sheriff seemed to think I'd find a job with the Fuentes. A job? You have changed your mind already? I know. Cos now I'm hungry. That's why I came here. You don't mean it. Help yourself. Eat it. Come on! All right. Now, get out. I don't like beggars around my place. Although it may seem odd, to my friends, my name is Morning Glory. (Kisses) Yesterday the flowers weren't at all well, so I sat up with them all night, and, well, they're better now. - They're responding. Do you like flowers? - Mm-hm. Let me show you this variety. It's one I've bred. It's named for the Browns, who used to be the leading family in town. I owe all this to them, especially to Miss Hally. Are you just passing through? Yes, I was, but now I've changed my plans. You're staying here in Membres? You like the flowers, you don't carry a gun, you want to stay in Membres? Hell, you must be crazy! Uh, thank you. Uh, where are you gonna live? You can stay with me, if you can't find anything better. Thank you. That's mighty nice of you. You can give me a hand. There's plenty of work to do. Watering the flowers and that. Say, somehow I feel I know you. Oh, that's just because I'm so ordinary. I always remind people of someone they know. You see those flowers? Oh-ho! My poor flowers! I left them for just a few minutes. They're gonna be lonesome. Adios! Hello, Morning Glory. Afternoon, Rosita. (Chuckles) Here's your rose waiting for you. (Rosita) What a handsome man. Who are you? I don't remember seeing you before. That's cos I just came here. I'm a cousin of Morning Glory's. Uh, a very distant cousin. Come see me. I'll tell you what the cards say. I can see what lies ahead. It'll amuse you. What more do you want out of life? Now I remember! Of course! Yes, indeed. My Uncle Alfonso. Remarkable family resemblance. But exactly how are we related? (Chuckles) Let's go inside! I'll explain afterwards. - Ooh! Yes! - Sorry. I'm sorry for you, but it can't be helped. I've got to make a funeral wreath for poor Judge Burns who got killed yesterday. Or he'll be completely forgotten. (Kisses) Good night. Don't let the bugs bite. You can help me arrange an important wreath for an important man killed by people who wanna be important. I'll be happy to help you. (Bell tolls) (♪ Organ music playing) (Priest speaks Latin) A splendid wreath. Only there's no inscription on it. Put it over there. (Speaks Latin) (Speaks Latin) (All pray in Latin) (Prays in Latin) (Wind howling) I heard you got a job now. Uh-huh. You'd have been better off with the Fuentes. But you seem to prefer picking posies with Morning Glory. Hm... doesn't show much ambition on your part, does it? Hell, I'm still new around here and I'm entitled to a few mistakes. (Horses approaching) Nobody wants to die, Sheriff. But to be afraid means dying every day. A man who isn't afraid can only die once. I don't have my gun. Would you shoot an unarmed man? Something must have started this killing. Gold was discovered. That's what. Didn't take long for word to get around. Once there's talk of a big gold strike, it brings men from even the most distant parts of the country. It was very easy for the Fuentes brothers to come here. Mexico's next door. (Crows like cockerel) (Clucks) Why hasn't someone tried to stop them? Well, they're afraid. You've heard of fear. Well, sure. They're afraid. Now they are. But I mean before when the Fuentes first came to the town. Why weren't they stopped then? There was nobody left here. The young men were away fighting. When the war ended, a few of them tried to return. But one by one they were ambushed and murdered, even before they got a chance to get back to town. After that, there wasn't much point in resisting. The Fuentes left no one alive, but a few old men. Some of whom tried to fight back. The first of the brave ones was Senator Brown. The last was the judge and you saw what happened to him. (Breathes heavily) (Sighs) How did the senator die? - Did they kill him? - (Pots clanging) Some say he died of a broken heart. Well, it was broken, all right. They fired several dead bullets right into it. He was brave, the senator. It's too bad his son never returned. On the other hand, it's just as well this way. - It's all for the best. - What do you mean? There'd have been trouble. His wife wasn't exactly lonely. I'll see you in the morning. Good night and sweet dreams. (Gun cocks) (Gun cocks) Come, dear. I told you to stay close to the carriage. I'm coming! (♪ Spanish background music) (Groans) Hm... Who's buying the drinks? (Chuckles) Don't you like women? Or am I making it too easy for you? (Chuckles) When a man refuses a woman, then either he isn't a man or he's thinking of someone else. Let's see which it is. Sometimes it's better not to keep secrets. The cards will give you away. They always tell the truth. Esteban... I have just been insulted. (Groans) - (Sniffs) - Esteban! Please, wait a minute before you kill the man. A dead man won't be very amusing. It's much more fun to frighten him to death. I'm so impressed with the way you fought. Mmm, mmm. (Groans) (Rosita) The sheriff helped me carry you up to my room. Morning Glory would probably faint if he saw you in this condition. I can't quite figure you out. Esteban was about to kill you, and yet obviously you weren't afraid. You know, at first I thought it was an act. Since most men are afraid. I'm not sure I like such bravery. (Groans) You were badly outnumbered. Yet you kept on. You might have used the gun you keep in your shirt. Let's find out what the cards say. Your gun is in the top drawer. You may take it if you want to, but it'll be all right where it is until the morning. Don't go! You'll be safer here with me. (Door opens, closes) There you are! At last! Where'd you sleep last night? What? In there? Explain that. I'll explain afterwards. What's that? Has someone else been killed? It's Brown. A terrible loss. Montgomery Brown. They called him Ringo. He came back. Well, we've got work to do. Come on. Let's go. Paco Fuentes has ordered a funeral no one will forget. (Wind howling) Montgomery Brown is dead. We won't see him again. May we rest in peace as we live in peace. (Fanfare playing) (Exhales) The Bible reminds us that we're all poor creatures made of dust and we return to dust. (Priest prays in Latin) (Sings in Spanish) Bless O Lord, your humble children and bless the bread we're about to eat, given us by your divine grace. Amen. (Indistinct chatter) (Sings in Spanish) Thank you, Morning Glory, for the splendid flowers. I'm happy that they pleased you, Hally. An excellent job, Morning Glory. We are both very pleased. You and your assistant are both invited to remain here for the fiesta. (Guitar music playing) Father, I have something to tell you. This Sunday I want you to marry us. Now that we know what's happened to poor Captain Brown, it's time we made definite plans to get married. We've been patient too long. Isn't that right, dear? One, two, three, four, five, six... ...seven, eight, nine, ten, 11. (Music stops) (Footsteps approaching) (Music box playing) (Music stops) (Groans) (Groans) (Gasps) Who are you? What are you doing here? (Gasps) (Paco) Hally? Hally? Hally, where are you? Dear, everyone's wondering where you are. And I miss you, too. (Gasps) (Paco) I can't be without you, even for a minute. (Gasps) (Exhales, breathes deeply) Let's go. (Groans) Paco? Did you see anyone just now? Upstairs? No. (Esteban) Probably a guest looking around. But I don't like curiosity. Let's have a look. (Door opens) I wouldn't leave if I were you. Just hold everything right there, friend. (Chuckles) There's more than flowers in here. So you wanna make a fortune without working? (Grunts) (Grunts) (Chuckles) Tradition is to cut off a thief's right hand. That's what's been done for centuries. However, today is a holiday. We'll make an exception. - And be lenient. - (Esteban) Mm. (Captain yells, groans) (Gulps) (Pan clangs, pot smashes) (Morning Glory) Hello, Miss Hally. Nice to see you. I'd like to choose some flowers. For the church ceremony. Is he in the house? Of course. - Tell me her name. - Elizabeth. After your mother. I had to leave her in the house. We're not permitted to go out together. You must find some way to bring her with you tonight. I'll be at the cemetery with two horses. Before anyone even notices that you've gone, we'll be far away. Leave town? But that means all that's happened these last years is wasted. Wasted? Why? Hally, you waited for me to come back. Now I'm back. We can begin living again. What about the others who have been waiting? How can you leave them to suffer here? Those people are beyond help. They're already dead with fear. Not yet, but they'll soon be dead. If you really abandon them. Look at me, Hally! Count the Mexicans who are living here. It isn't any contest. What if the Fuentes' hurt you? It's too much for just one man! And I've got a broken gun hand. I've been expecting you to ask, if there's anything between me and Paco. It doesn't matter. It matters to me. Please let me explain what happened. I already know. You said at the cemetery. Tonight. (Sighs) No. No, not tonight. Be patient. I promise to come. Morning Glory will tell you when. (Door opens, wind howling) (Door opens, closes repeatedly) I hoped you'd be back. I'll bring the cards. Is it possible to know the future? The past doesn't interest you? The past is over. That's strange. It's completely different. There are many changes. In the future? No. It's you who are different. A truly fearless man doesn't hope for anything. Only those who have some hope really care. And a man who hopes fears. You see? You're now afraid. Where are you going? Wait a minute. I haven't told you the future. It doesn't matter. I know it. (Gunshots) (Grunts) (Breathes heavily) (Exhales deeply) (Gun cocks) (Gunshot) (Spanish music in the background) (Chuckles) I have some cash to gamble with, if you'll let me play a few hands. (Wind howling) You're just unlucky I guess. Luck nothing. The whole game was obviously fixed. I saw it with my own eyes. I saw you cheat, Esteban. - I don't believe my ears. - You heard what I said. I'd have witnesses if these two weren't up to the same tricks, but they're swindlers, too. - (Groans) - (Guffaws) (Captain) Why don't you arrest him, Sheriff? Cheating at cards is against the law, even here, isn't it? You're supposed to carry out the law. But maybe a busy sheriff can't be bothered with petty crimes. Is that how it is? Well, how about it? I wouldn't mind helping you. On behalf of the sheriff and in the name of the law, I place you under arrest. (Glass smashing) You must agree, Sheriff. It isn't difficult. Just make up your mind, that's all. I'll even help you to take them all off to jail. Maybe. Who are you? No time now, Sheriff. I'll explain afterwards. Montgomery Brown. (Door opens) Esteban said not to wait for him. Is that why you're here? Morning Glory had him arrested. He cheated at cards. Since the sheriff himself was there, he made the arrest and took him away. When Paco hears that he'll kill both the sheriff and Morning Glory. Oh, yeah? Not if Paco doesn't hear about it. If you tell Juan or one of the other men... ...they can get Esteban out before the sheriff knows what's going on. You ought to be able to convince Esteban he should forget what happened, right? They must have been mad to do it. The sheriff and Morning Glory will both need some help. When Paco Fuentes hears what I've done... He'll be looking for you and you're going to have to defend yourself. Unless you wanna be killed. We can't possibly hope to stop the Fuentes'. I've got my gun. That's one. You'll be with me. Fine. That's two. Who else do you expect? Morning Glory? All right, suppose he's the third. Then what? The whole idea's insane! Yeah, I know. What are you looking for? Dynamite. You got any? Uh... This belonged to the judge's son, didn't it? - Uh-huh. - (Bottle clinking) (Captain) We could use some fresh air in here, Sheriff. Sheriff! Sheriff, come out of there. You have had your fun, Sheriff. You'd better pray that Esteban's been enjoying it, too. - Let him out now and be quick about it. - I'm sorry to disappoint you boys. But the sheriff likes having him around. He'll be perfectly safe until his trial begins. He's not going anywhere. (Raucous laughter) (Groans) (Horse neighing) Do we leave them lying around like that, eh? - Yes, for a little while, but... - But what? Well, I'll explain afterwards. (Tolls) (Bell tolling) (Horse neighing) Here, what are you doing? (Grunts) What is that? Dynamite. (Dog barking in the distance) (Morning Glory) Wait here. With your permission Don Paco, we've brought a present for your wedding. It's something special. I saved you the best flowers. Just be sure your helper doesn't cause any more trouble. Oh, I almost forgot: Esteban and the others aren't coming back here tonight because they began celebrating earlier today. Now, let's get started. I think we should put these plants by the door. Flowers at the entrance always look inviting. There. We'll arrange the others inside the house. (Bangs on door) (Wind howling) (Peals) (Horses' hooves clopping in the distance) (Gun cocks) Forgive me, Don Paco. It came unexpectedly. I knew them very well. It might be better if your marriage were postponed. I never postpone anything. (Wind howling) (Gun clicks) You stay inside, all right? You promised you would, remember? I trust you. - Hello. - Come over here. What are you doing with those cartridges? (Groans) We have gathered here to bless the marriage between Don Paco Fuentes, our town's noble benefactor... ...and this woman, Hally Fitzgerald Brown, the widower of Captain Montgomery Brown. Esteban? Esteban? Rosita. When are you gonna get me out of here? Don Paco Fuentes, do you promise to love and protect Hally Fitzgerald according to the rites of the Holy Roman Church? I do. Hally Fitzgerald, do you promise to honor and obey forever Don Paco Fuentes according to the rites of the Holy Roman Church? Dearest, Elizabeth is waiting for you. Yes. (Speaks Latin) I've come back, Paco Fuentes. I've come back. I've come back! I've come back! The horses! They're gone! Hally? Hally! (Grunts) (Gunshot) (Gunshots) (Horse neighing) (Gunshots in the distance) Why did you do that? You promised to forget! Mr Horrible Pig! (Chuckles) - (Screams) - Let's go! (Groans) (Groans) (Gunshots) (Groans) He was a brave man who believed in helping others. We will miss him. He's dead because of me. You can blame me for it. It's my fault this happened. We all make mistakes. Well, the time has come when you have to choose. There's gonna be a showdown here at last. Don't back down, unless you're afraid. We may be killed. (Blows) Let's get the men going. We're gonna need a lot of horses. I'll explain later. (Birds chirping) Ah. (Chuckles) (Gun cocks) (Chokes) (Grunts) (Grunts) (Groans, screams) Hello. Hello there. Mm. (Gunshot) (Groans) Follow me! (Gunshots) (Gunshots) (Gun cocks) (Groans) (Groans) (Groans) (Elizabeth hums) (Captain) Come on. - Let's go to the air. - Yes, sir. Instead of "sir" call me Papa. Why should I call you Papa? - I'll explain afterwards, Elizabeth. - All right... Papa. Shall I help you, Papa? (Grunts) (Grunts) (Clears throat) (Chuckles) Hm. (Sword clangs) (Gunshots in the distance) (Grunts) (Banging) (Groaning) (Metal clanging) - It's a big gun, Papa. - Mm. All right, you have to stay quiet now. Can you do it? Play with this and don't leave the attic. I know, Papa. Or else those men will catch me and then your plan won't work out, right? Mm. Hmm. (Gunshots in the distance) (Groaning) (Gunshots) (Gasps) (Captain) Hey. (Groans) (Groans) (Cheers) (Gunshots) (Gun cocks) (Gunshots) (Gunfire) (Gun cocks) (Groans) (Explosion) (Groans) (Groans) - (Groans) - (Coughs) (Gun cocks) (Groans) (Groans) (Gun cocks) ♪ If you see a man with downcast eyes and ragged clothes ♪ Walking through your village ♪ Don't shun him but go beside ♪ I'm that man and now I beg you help me ♪ I need you ♪ I need you ♪ The liar who told my sweetheart that I was dead Dearest, where on earth did you find that dress?
