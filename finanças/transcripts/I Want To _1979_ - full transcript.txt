There was a woman who smelled like wood. You relate all your stories to women. I have to pee! Again? How many times in a night do you have to go? I'm just restless. What's wrong? Venus is in a different location. It was in that area last night. It couldn't have moved that much overnight. It's impossible. Don't lean against me! Nemoto, come over here. Mimura, you're so cool! Fighting again? So, you're leaving? My wife is pregnant, so she's been nagging me. Agata, what time is it? My watch stopped at 5:18. What's wrong? Mine stopped, too... at 5:18. I am Nishizawa. We're from the 63rd General Regiment. And I am Seki. I am lba of the 54th General Regiment. Do pirates appear here? Is it just the two of you? The entire East District Q.M.C. Will be gathering here. We are the escorts. What time do you have? It stopped. At what time? At 5:18. What's wrong? The cell motor is acting up. I was told you had parts. All right, return to your unit after you've repaired it. Yano, put this away. So what did you decide? We're eloping. We're meeting at lmafuri Station tomorrow. You're not returning with the unit? Her friend is in Hokkaido, so we're going there. I see. What time is it? 5:18... Mine, too. SENGOKU JIEITAI (GI SAMURAl) Agata! Kimura! Shimada! Nishizawa! Check your units! Everyone is here. What happened? I feel as though I've been unconscious for a long time. Me, too. Didn't your watch stop? It's moving again. What time is sunrise? I don't know what day today is, but on the first day of training it was at 5:18. What is going on? There was a power plant there! Where did it go? Where is it?! Everyone, calm down. I have to pee... Quit joking! The truck, armored car and tank are still here. So it has to be the supply base we were supposed to gather at. Then we'd be surrounded by troops now. Why is it just us? Kimura, radio contact! No one is responding! The terrain looks very familiar, but the environment is different. Didn't that ship sink into the sea? I am Ono! We are from the Maritime Self-Defense Force! I am Kawashima! And I am Tsuda! I am lba of the 54th General Regiment. What is going on? We're not sure ourselves. We were on our way to join the fleet. When we came to, our ship was heading this way. We had assumed that you went down with the ship. It felt that way, but instead of water, we sank into a sea of light. He has to pee again. Is there a festival going on? I am Shimizu. We're from the 1st Helicopter Group. I am Onishi. I'm lba of the General Regiment. Where were you until now? We were on our way to participate in the training operation. When all of a sudden the altitude dropped and it felt like we were being sucked into the ocean. What is going on? We may have traveled back in time. Don't shoot! Yano... If you defy my orders again, I won't forgive you. Isn't this the first time you've shot someone? How did it feel? Don't shoot! Do not fire until I give the word! I am Nagao Kagetora! I serve Lord Koizumi Yukinaga of Kasugayama Castle. I am Kuribayashi Magoichi! And I am Ishiwa Takehide! Asaba Yorichika! Tatekawa Kazumasu! I am lba Yoshiaki of the Ground Self-Defense Forces. We're the same. Where are you from? We're the regiment from the Eastern District. Why are you here? Well, you could say we drifted here. The steel horse is making noise. Your sudden appearance in our camp has driven Kuroda Nagaharu into complete panic! What is that thing that was flying in the sky? You mean the helicopter? And the thing that was making all that noise... Is it a type of gun? It's a machine gun. Machine... machine... How do I get up? Can I go up closer to see it? All right. Pardon me. What is this called? This is a 50-caliber heavy machine gun. Would you like to test it? Me? Magoichi, watch me! How do I aim? The warring era... I'd like to have them in our army by all means. Monkey, can you think of something? Let's deliver rice and miso to their camp. They mentioned they had enough supplies for a while. Transporting food supplies after you've played with the machine gun will make the Kuroda army think they are on our side. You are witty as ever. We have gone back in time after all. What? We're in a totally different time period. Stop joking. That can't possibly happen. But it did. Some kind of phenomenon must have caused this. Kagetora is a strange guy. "We're the same." "Helicopter." Everyone, get down! Why? Why, you...! Don't shoot! Don't anyone shoot! Don't intervene! If you do... Drive! Hurry it up! Agata, move! Hurry! You did it again! - Thrust forward! - Are you sure? Do it! Kagetora is here! Our ally... I appreciate your assistance! Kill him! I have killed him... I have Nagaharu's head! That was cool. Kano, is killing people so cool? We just did the same thing as lba. Two of our guys died. It was kill or be killed. The rifle squad showed up, too. We have nothing to do with this time period. If we intervene, we'll be changing history. Then what? History may not forgive us. What do you mean? We can't return to our time period? Does that mean we'll die? All we know about time is that there are 24 hours in a day. However, in the natural world, there is a restoring force that surpasses our understanding. Think of it as an aftershock following an earthquake that is trying to restore the inner earth. So if that earthquake-like thing that happened once were to happen again, we can go back to our time? I'm not sure, but it is a possibility. Morishita. The unit is panicking because you left. You are our star. Without you, there is no Japanese who can compete against the foreigners in the Autumn International Marathon. I feel relieved. I feel relieved knowing that I don't have to run. It's already 1:00. I'm going. Where to? Lmafuri Station. I'm supposed to meet Kazuko there. Maybe it's just this area that we went back in time. Kazuko may be waiting. I don't want to just wait around here. Just bear it a little longer. For how long? We may never go back! We may die like the other two! Takashima! If there's an aftershock, we may be able to return! Why? Had he thrown that fire into the truck, we'd all be dead. We're comrades. You don't mind being killed by that fool? Why didn't you aim for his leg? Fulfill your objective... You taught me that. Nishizawa... It's dangerous alone. I'll go with you. Let's go. Where did they go without telling anyone? Perhaps they returned to the present. Fool! How could just the two of them return? Kikuchi, it'll be hard to pass over this mountain by foot. Quiet down! My lord requests that you report to the castle. The steel ship that flies, the steel box that runs on land, and a gun that kills tens of people at once. He would like to see it for himself. I appreciate the invitation, but I must decline. We cannot side with either armies. Should we go to your castle, there'll be misunderstandings. You won't heed my master's request? No. Report back to your master. That he's a fool and a coward who is trying to reap the benefits without fighting. Tell him Kagetora said that. Go. After meeting you, I made a decision. I don't consider a man who hides in the castle and gains the third party's profit as my lord. I don't feel like fighting for a man like that. Loyalty is to serve a lord from the heart. Loyalty is to become friends from the heart. Battles are a time of luck. We may die tomorrow. That is why I want to be true to myself. Will you fight with me? Let's rule together. Why me? I was born to fight. I love to fight. I know nothing else. I viewed you as someone similar to myself. You are someone who is suited to live in the warring era. My grandmother gave it to me. You remind me of my late grandchild. Father was murdered. I envy you. Are women that great? You must've fallen in love before. No, I haven't. Everyone, do you agree? To return to the Showa Period, we must fight history and take control. There is nothing in history that says we took rule. That is why we must rule and throw history out of order. Then, because of the shock, the god of time will return us to the Showa Period. We may get killed in the process. Is there any other way? Yano. Forget about that incident. I don't like to be betrayed. Did you think there would be a military coup then? That wasn't it! That wasn't it. My stupidity in believing in you... ...won't allow me to forgive you! He was under orders from the higher ups. He infiltrated your unit to find out the ringleader of the coup. His intentions were not to betray you. Because of his efforts, you received a lighter punishment. Yano, stop it. I'll find your groom soon. The last one. Run! Go ahead! Run! You have a girlfriend waiting for you! Go first! Kazuko! Why are you here? You were in. What are you doing? Protecting the patrol boat is one of our duties. We knew the waves would be high at night. What are the weapons for? Lba ordered it. What for? I don't know what he's thinking. Let's load it. Please don't... I'll do anything. Die now or join us. I'll go with you! Bye. Start the engine! Hurry! Yano! Kano! Let's switch! What's this? Grease. Living is so much fun! Let's take over a castle and place some women in. We'll be kings! Shimada, are you asleep? A sloven guy... Yano, lba would like to speak with you. Ignore it. Hurry and tell me what you want. He answered! Verify his position. This is lba. Come back. If you surrender now, I'll reconsider your punishment. I've heard that before. Listen up. We'll be attacking the villages from now to capture women and food supplies. If you have a problem, come after us! I'll say this once more. Return here. I'm not a coward and a traitor like you. Attack me if you don't agree! I'll take you on if you want me to. Let the women go. I found them! They are at the two o'clock position! They found us. I let them find us. Hurry. Here they come. Get closer to the shore. We'll let the women go. Hurry and get off! Women of the warring era... I'll get off. I don't like killing comrades. I can't follow you. Shimada... You must settle your own path in life. They took the rocket launcher, too. Three rifles, a submachine gun, and hand grenades. They have guts. Come on, hit! It's a 60 millimeter close attack. If they hit us, the chopper will blow into pieces! They can't possibly hit us from the boat. Mimura... Remember the position of the patrol boat very well. I'll drop you off under the lee of the island. It's a dead angle from the boat, so they can't see it. To protect the chopper from the patrol boat, I'll be the decoy. Wait for the right moment. You're the 54th Regiment's best sniper. Mimura... You only have one chance. Do you understand? Don't lower the chopper. They're back again. What are they doing? Protecting the chopper from the rocket launcher. Hold it steady. From here on, I will live from my heart. I will rule the country with Nagao Kagetora. I'll join you. It's too complex for me to understand. However, ten of us have died already. I would rather go down fighting. Count me in. Agata, we'll play war. I'll bet on being able to return to the Showa Period. I'll take a gamble, too. I'm going to pee. Again? His timing is impeccable. It's been a while since we ran the tank. I want to go home! If you are all going, count me in, too. I'm sorry, but I'll stay back. Alone? I promised the kids I'd be their brother. What will you do here by yourself? If there is an aftershock and we return in time, what will you do alone? Nemoto, think it over carefully. Your ancestors may be here. If you get involved with them... Agata, let him go. I am so busy... To Kasugayama Castle! What's wrong? Is she your woman? No... She disappeared. Liluchi! Lazulo is waiting... Treat him. I will leave now. We will finally enter lasugayama Castle tomorrow. I am looling forward to it. LORD IOIZMI YllNAGA lagetora, I heard you called me a fool. Indeed I did. While luroda and I were battling each other, you were planning to join hands with the Irobe. I said you were a coward and a big fool. Did you come here to die?! No... I am here for your life. Have you gone insane?! Settle down! I'm ashamed to have revered this idiot as my lord. It'll be my rule now. I, lagetora, will rule! Follow me. Those who defy me will be lilled. Don't touch that. Return to your post! We'll tale this route. That way, the tanl can pass. That road leads to lawanalajima. That's where Shingen is. We'll lill Shingen. You head for the west and battle the Asai-Asalura. Can you defeat Shingen with just your troops? Shingen is formidable. Lagetora, we'll meet in lyoto. That is when we will rule together. Hold this for me. Go and get her. Then I'll bring her. Who wants a woman? I made the arrangements with the village below. A prostitute? A widow. If you want to see her, do so tonight. We're allowed to do that? It is the courtesy around here for the young men to visit the widow. I'm going. You're uicl about these things. Maybe I'll go, too. Let's go. This is something I can't do in our period! That's right. It's unlile our suffocating Showa period. You are free to live as you wish. Enjoy yourselves. He doesn't pee at a time lile this. I feel bad towards my wife. Fool, don't worry about something years later. You're so clear-cut about these things. It's that house. What are you doing? Once naled, we're all the same. You're right. IAZIO Visiting a woman? We're doing the same. Let's decide the order by janlen. Marathon... Marathon? I'm the third one. That's a lot. It could be just the flags. Maybe my ancestors are out there. Let's use the trench mortar. Morishita! Mimura! The azimuth angle from the cardinal point is degrees. Distance, 994 feet. Repare for attacl. Fire! Agata, head for the horses. Liluchi, watch out! I must harm the enemy. Refuel! Don't move the trucl! Let's move out! Abandon vehicle! Transfer to the AC! Shoot! Nonala, what's wrong?! They are too close. Shoot! We can return to the Showa eriod! Maruola, move! Hurry! Attacl! Rifle suad, fire! Fire! We're saved. An-len-po. Out of bullets! Get into the chopper. Don't shoot! Leave! Lool. Inform them! The radio isn't worling! Morishita, bacl them! Onishi, a man is hanging! Nder the chopper! Come down! Onishi, we're landing. Onishi! Onishi! Don't cry. Fight! Find the headuarters! Get Shingen's head! Headuarters... lazulo! Give me a gun! Anything! Hurry! Faster! We're out of fuel! You're still a child... The warring era... A runaway horse! Intruder! Are you lba Yoshiali? Lord Taleda Shingen... Iba Yoshiali who has no eual? I am impressed with your strategy. Men, come out! I reuire no assistance. I will avenge my father! I lilled Shingen! Well done, Yoshiali. We will meet in lyoto. Lagetora is waiting at Anegawa, Omi. We'll be ruling the country. SHOGN ASHllAGA YOSHIAll HOSOIAWA FITAIA IMERIAL ALACE I promised lba Yoshiali we would rule together. Ecause of one promise, are you willing to let the chance to rule slip away? What happened? In his battle with Shingen, lba Yoshiali lost his flying steel bo, his steel car, and barely made it to Myorenji. The run-down temple is the perfect place for them to die. Lord Fujitala... We no longer reuire lagetora's assistance. Send your troops to Myorenji and lill lba Yoshiali! Wait, Lord Fujitala. Lease wait! We cannot forgive a man who we Inow nothing about and who goes against the stream of the times. If you side with him, you will die, too. IO YOSHITAIA Will there be another time slip? Will we be able to go bacl? The position of Venus is changing. Really? Maybe we should return to that supply base again. That location has the best possibility for another time slip to occur. You're right. Let's go there. Right away. Did you come up with that out of fear? Venus is informing us of a time slip! Y us taling rule, history will change. We can return then. I cannot possibly thinl history will be out of order! Why not? Efore that happens, it will retaliate. It will attempt to destroy us. That's not true. We have already lost 1 men. Let's go bacl. I thinl Agata is right. We will all die at this rate. Let's return as Agata suggests. Mimura, the woman has made you an idiot. We should leave. That is our opinions. I agree. Are you telling me what to do? I am the leader. If you defy me, I will shoot you. You don't want to go bacl to the Showa. What? From the beginning, you wanted to fight during this period. What good is it to return? What good is it to return to a peaceful era? To return to a period you have weapons but can't fight? Wouldn't you rather stay and fight here? To live as you wish? You can do that here. I don't even thinl that. You have no right to say anything! A man who hides every time we fight has no say! I admit I hid... but I was scared. I'm a coward. Ut what good is it to die fighting? Is it that great to die a hero? I'd rather live with my wife and child. I love that period... that peaceful era! I will not let history destroy me. I'll say this again, you men stay here. First suad, forward! Aim right here and shoot. I'm counting on you. I don't want a stranger to lill me. I'd rather die by your hand. Lagetora! Stay bacl! This has nothing to do with you. Lagetora, I will rule. THE END
