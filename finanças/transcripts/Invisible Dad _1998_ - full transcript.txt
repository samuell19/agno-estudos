[WIND HOWLING] [THUNDERCLAP] [MUSIC PLAYING] [THUNDERCLAP] DOUG (VOICEOVER): The name's Baily. Doug Baily. And this is my new home. My dad's out front, moving us in. We move a lot. Dad says he has to go where the work is, so I get to see a lot of the world-- from a moving van. One thing I've learned-- neighbors are pretty much the same all over the world, especially the weird ones. Captain Weiderman, Neighborhood Eye. This is my neighborhood. That's my house. It's my job to make sure that both are safe. Plan on staying here long, do you? Yeah, we're moving in. Well, then in that case, I'm going to need your full name for my report. Baily. Andrew Baily and son. Two of you? No, there's just one of me and one of him. Wiseacre. DOUG (VOICEOVER): That's my dad, making friends wherever he goes. By the way, that's me. I spend a lot of time in my room. It's hard to make friends when you're always moving. I have a special friend I always take with me. DOUG: Well, Mom, here we go again. DOUG (VOICEOVER): The best mom in the whole world. I miss her a lot. So does Dad. Oh, did I tell you I'm into computers? I don't buy them, because we don't have much money. So I build them. My computer'll take up to 64-bit when I'm finished. Do you want to play the new game I invented? [CALCULATOR WHIRS] DOUG (VOICEOVER): Well, no one ever said my dad was a great conversationalist. [MUSIC PLAYING] Whee! "Amazing Mouse Maze!" Hey, Dad. Want to play this new game I invented? It's called "The Amazing Mouse Maze." Nah, not tonight, pal. It's time for bed. But Dad, we never have any fun together. You're always working. [SIGH] Look, I know it hasn't been easy for either one of us since Mom died. I tell you what. Would you just give me a little more time to get caught up at the new job, hm? All the time in the world. ANDREW: Thank you for seeing me, Ms. Whitmer. COURTNEY: I've been looking very much forward to meeting you, Andrew. Welcome to Whitmer Architectural Design. Well, I've been looking forward to working with you, ms. Whitmer. I've always wanted to design a spectacular shopping mall. Excellent. And please call me Courtney. We have quite a small firm, Andrew, and I'll be honest with you. With all the big competition from big firms, I'd go belly-up without this kind of a project. The city fathers have decided that this new model is going to be the cornerstone of a new Oakmoor. What do you think of that? It's a challenge. It's garbage. But it's what they've got the investors to think, and the investors want me to do the job. If they don't like the design, however, they'll go elsewhere. And if I lose any chance to compete, I'll have to shut my doors. So you thought of me. You come highly recommended, Andrew. The pay is lousy and the hours are long. But you give me a great mall design, and I'll double your salary. [KNOCK] Andrew Baily, meet Duncan Gilbert. Duncan is our junior architect. Duncan, Andrew is going to be doing the new mall project. I want you to assist him. But I-- I thought I was doing the mall project. This isn't fair. COURTNEY: Duncan, you've been with our firm six months, and in that time, you've risen considerably. And not without stepping on a few toes. Don't step on mine. Well, I, uh, I hope we can do some great things together. I cleaned the office, Miss Courtney. Artie. This is our handyman and head of security. Yeah, except I don't have a gun. Yes. Yes, that's right, Artie. You're too dangerous for a gun. Yep. Excuse me. [CHUCKLES] We've been everywhere-- Chicago, New Orleans, Kansas City. My Dad just keeps moving from job to job. That must be fun, you and your dad, traveling the country together. Nope. Wherever we go, he just works. I'm either at home or at school. I hardly ever see him. I better go do my paper right now. See you later. Bye. DOUG (VOICEOVER): That's Jimmy, my new best friend. Most kids like me when they first meet me, but then I have to move away. Or Dad gets in one of his moods and scares him off, and then I never see him again. "I'll be home late. TV dinner in the freezer. Don't forget to clean up the garage before watching any TV. Love, Dad." DOUG (VOICEOVER): Whenever we move, I get to clean out the garage. It's a father/son thing we do. I clean the garage. JIMMY: Hey, Doug. DOUG (VOICEOVER): He works late. Watch this! DOUG (VOICEOVER): Did I mention Jimmy? Oh, yeah, I guess I did. MR. WEIDERMAN: Got a bad feeling about this. I wonder if our new neighbors found any of Rivington's gadgets. I think I'm gonna go talk to that boy. Maybe the new neighbors are aliens, too. Mildred, how long have I been captain of the Neighborhood Eye? 15 years. That's right, 15 years. And I happen to have documented proof that Mr. Rivington was an alien. Now, if I hadn't been on my toes for all this time, this neighborhood would be destroyed. You just keep that in mind, Mildred. What you got in the boxes, son? Bunch of old electronics stuff. I guess the guy who lived here was a gadget freak. He was an inventor. So, you like electronics, huh, son? Yeah, I build my own PC drive. Hey, I wonder if there's any spare parts in here. Wonder why he didn't take this stuff with him when he moved. Old Man Rivington didn't just move, son. He disappeared. Disappeared? MR. WEIDERMAN: That's right. Rivington was an alien. Had a lot of tricky gadgets. Made a lot noises. Some popped and whiz. He made a lot of loud noises, and then one day, he just vanished. Aliens can do things like that, you know? Better be careful something like that doesn't happen to you someday. Just keep your nose clean, son. Remember that. DOUG (VOICEOVER): Keep your nose clean. Prophetic words indeed. I figured if Old Man Rivington was some kind of inventor, maybe he left some cool stuff buried in the garage. If it was in the garage, it was mine. Right of salvage. Like when treasure hunters find old shipwrecks. For the first time, I was actually glad to clean out the garage. Bingo. I had no idea what this thing was, but it certainly warranted further investigation. The first thing I had to do was get this thing powered up. But I didn't know how. Oh-- power plug. [WHIRRING AND BEEPING] Hm. Hm. [BEEPING AND WHIRRING] Of course. They don't call me a computer whiz for nothing. [BEEPING] Yes! ANDREW: (MUTTERING) Oh, what the-- oh, I can't believe this. Geez, do I have to do everything around here? [SIGH] Simple instructions, Doug. Is that too difficult to understand? [SLAMS DOOR] [BEEPING] Doug? What the heck is that thing? Found it in the garage. Some kind of old machine. It's safe. Alls it does is light up. Yeah, well, turn it off before you get hurt. And why didn't you clean up the garage? Well, when I found the machine, I-- I'm sorry, Dad. Sorry doesn't get it. Man, it's almost 9 o'clock. Listen, you go finish cleaning up the garage, and then go to bed. And no TV tonight. But Dad, "Ocean View" is on, with Shari Vail. Shari Vail. You want to watch TV, you pull your own weight around here. Take care of your responsibilities. Man, I wish it was still 4 o'clock. [PULSING BEEP] [BEEPING] [BEEPING] JIMMY: Hey, Doug, watch this! DOUG (VOICEOVER): What the? Uh-oh. [BEEPING] 4:00 PM. Cool! ANNOUNCER (ON TV): Now stay tuned for "Ocean View," the number one syndicated prime-time TV show, starring Shari Vail. In tonight's episode, when a group of terrorists take over an Ohio-- Hey, Dad. I cleaned up the garage. "Ocean View" is on. Oh, good. Could use a little break. How was your day? Interesting, Dad. Real interesting. ANDREW: I'm proud of you, son. ANNOUNCER (ON TV): We'll be back after these messages. DOUG: [LAUGHS] Thanks for helping, Doug. So what are you going to do with the machine? I don't know yet. Don't even know everything it does. If you could have anything in the world, what would it be? Maybe a girlfriend for my dad. How about Ms. Collier? She's a babe. Our teacher? Gross! Here's a list of some video games I want. No way. That's like stealing. And I don't even know if it works like that. Besides, I got an idea for an experiment. Hey, you sure I can't fix you some breakfast, huh? Uh, no thanks, Dad. I'll make it myself. OK. Have a nice day. [BEEPING AND WHIRRING] I wish for a big banana split to appear on my kitchen table. [BEEPING AND WHIRRING] [PULSING BEEP] Breakfast is the most important meal of the day. DUNCAN: Thunderbird Construction is clearly the low bid. We can't go with anyone else. COURTNEY: Well, it's a great bid, Duncan, but hasn't Thunderbird been fined for using substandard materials in their projects? Just ugly rumors. It's up to Andrew. [PHONE BEEPS] Andrew Baily. Yes? My son called in sick? Yeah, I'll go check on him. Uh, thanks for calling. My son is sick. I've got to run home. As far as Thunderbird Construction goes, if it's up to me, I say no. It's too risky. You get what you pay for. Good. Well, as long as Andrew's on the job, he calls the shots, Duncan. I'll try and remember that. [GROANS] (QUIETLY) Julie? Get me Thunderbird Construction on the phone. DOUG (VOICEOVER): This is my teacher, Ms. Collier. Single, smart, and available. Oh, that part where I said she was gross? Well, that's not exactly true. I mean, she's no Shari Vail, but she's what Dad used to call a stone fox in high school. Did I mention my dad is weird? Uh, hello? Hi. My name is Sandra Collier. I'm Doug's teacher. I just, uh, I thought I'd drop by and see how he's doing. Well, he's got a little flu but. But, uh, please, come in. Thank you. Uh, you'll have to excuse the place. We're-- we're still unpacking. Uh, have a seat. Thank you. Doug's a very bright boy. Sometimes I think he's too bright for my class. Is that good or bad? I don't know. I just think he's bored. I asked the students to write reports on great movie detectives, and, uh, this is what he turned in. He copied the whole thing out of a book. I've got to give him credit for knowing where to look. At least he didn't download it from the internet. Yeah, he's quite the little detective. Yeah. I had to give him an F on the paper. He's got so much potential. That's why I don't understand this. Well, I'll be sure and have a talk with him. Thank you, Ms. Collier. Oh, Sandra. Call me Sandy. Sandy it is. Thank you. DOUG (VOICEOVER): Dad flunked the class on how to pick up chicks. Thanks again. You're welcome. DOUG (VOICEOVER): But I think maybe she's starting to like him. Must be that suave sparkle and wit. (ANGRILY) Maybe he's at that difficult age. [CLEARS THROAT] Your teacher thinks a lot of you. She thinks a lot of you too, Dad. I hear she's single. --[CLEARS THROAT] Yeah, well, uh, we're here to talk about your paper. No TV till you rewrite this. Dad, I hate history. It's boring. Boring? The detective story was created when Edgar Allan Poe wrote "The Murders in the Rue Morgue." Movie detectives are an American institution. When you read about these guys, try to imagine them right in front of you. Make history come alive. Good luck. Make history come alive. DOUG (VOICEOVER): What I was about to do was probably illegal in 49 states. But hey, I was desperate. [BEEPING AND WHIRRING] I wish for a famous movie detective to help me with my homework. [PULSING BEEP] [BEEPING AND WHIRRING] Whoa. I was expecting Sherlock Holmes. Sorry, kid, but I'm afraid you've been misinformed. [THUNDERCLAP] DOUG (VOICEOVER): What's the world coming to when you can't even cheat properly? I think my dad likes Ms. Collier. Great. Maybe they can go out, and she'll give you good grades. It's not that easy. Dad'll never ask her out. He's always at work. Maybe you can ask her out. DOUG (VOICEOVER): Jimmy was right. Dad needed a little help. Ms. Collier? MS. COLLIER (ON PHONE): Yes? This is Doug Baily. MS. COLLIER (ON PHONE): Oh, hi, Doug. My dad wanted me to call you. He's working late tonight. MS. COLLIER (ON PHONE): Yes? We're real new in this town, so he wanted me to ask you if you wanted to go to dinner. MS. COLLIER (ON PHONE): Dinner? Really? To discuss schoolwork and stuff. Sunday night? MS. COLLIER (ON PHONE): I'd be delighted. Where? Uh, Il Balcone's. 7 o'clock? MS. COLLIER (ON PHONE): Ok. I'll be there. Great. Bye. Hey, Dad. Can we go to dinner Sunday night? Yeah, sure. You pick it. But no burger joints. Love it when a plan works out. Stillwell, we have a problem. My firm's going to pass on your bid. I thought you had that all sealed up, boy. What are we paying you $50 grand for? The new architect thinks you're using substandard material on your building. We are. How do you think I bring the bid in so low? Let me show you something. What do you think that's made out of? Clay? Cement? Plain old flour. Of course, we do add a little clay and cement, just to make it solid. Dirt cheap. So what if the mall collapses? Hundreds of innocent people can get hurt. And that's if you get it past the building inspectors. That's their problem. Does this look like a brick to you? Does to me. And it's as hard as a rock. I got a lot of money riding on this project, and so do you. So it's up to you to change the new boy's mind. You do get my point, don't you? I get it. I'll think of something. I knew you would. [CAMERA SHUTTER CLICKING] [CAMERA SHUTTER CLICKING] So it's come to this, huh? Those aliens are taking over the bodies of our children. JIMMY: I have a bad feeling about this. [BEEPING AND WHIRRING] Won't your dad catch us? He's at work. On a Saturday? He works every day. Watch this. I wish for Shari Vail from "Ocean View" to appear in my room. [PULSING BEEP] [BEEPING AND WHIRRING] Oh, wow. Small alien creatures are inhabiting the house across the street. Those are neighborhood kids. Disguised as neighborhood kids, Mildred. The story must get out. The truth must be told. I'll call town line. No. No, wait, Mildred. Gotta have patience. I'm gonna need photographic evidence first. For the record, in case something happens to me, my name is Mr. Weiderman. [BEEPING AND WHIRRING] Is this like an alien abduction or something? Oh, wow. Uh, yes. We're aliens. And feds. Yeah. Mars needs lifeguards. Ah. [WHISTLING] Doug? We come in peace. This is so "X-Files." Doug, what's going on in here? Better go. Hi, Mr. Baily. Bye, Mr. Baily. What are you doing in my son's room? Are you gonna experiment on me? 'Cause I'm not into that kind of thing. [BOTH SHOUT] Hey! I wish Shari Vail would just go back where she came from. This is so not cool! [BEEPING AND WHIRRING] [PULSING BEEP] [BEEPING AND WHIRRING] That was Shari Vail, the TV star. Yeah, I know who she is-- was. Where did she go? That's a long story. Get rid of that thing. But Dad, think of all the money we could make. Alls I have to do is wish for it. In this family, we work for our money. We don't conjure it up out of thin air. Look, I mean it, Doug. Destroy that thing, now. Or I will. Oh, I can't believe this. It's like I'm stuck in the middle of a science-fiction movie. They must be stopped. [KNOCK] Oh, who's this, Boris Karloff? Noticed anything unusual around the house, Mr. Baily? Unusual? Come on, Mr. Baily. You know exactly what I mean. Aliens. I've got good reason to believe that aliens have been snooping around this house, looking for Mr. Rivington's inventions. Mr. Rivington was an alien. Really. Well, thanks for the warning, Mr. Weiderman. A word to the wise, Mr. Baily-- keep your nose clean. I hate my life. He doesn't understand. Sometimes I wish my dad would just disappear. [PULSING BEEP] Whoa-- whoa. Whoa. No, no. Oh, this is not happening. Oh! [CRASH] Oh, this is not good. (SHOUTING) Doug! Dad? What did you do when I went outside to talk to Mr. Weiderman? Nothing much. You look really weird. Yeah, well, did you say anything? Anything at all? Well, only that I wish that you'd-- DOUG (VOICEOVER): Ever hear that old saying, "Be careful what you wish for"? Uh-oh. What? Disappear. Disappear? You wished for that? Oh, go get that machine thing. But Dad, the machine is-- Doug, this is no time to argue with me. Go get it, now. He's right. I do look weird. What am I saying? I'm invisible. Well, maybe I can still see my-- great. Dad? Over here, in the rocking chair. Oh. What's this? It's the machine. You told me to destroy it. Wha-- oh no! Of all the times you've disobeyed or flat-out ignored med, why did you pick today to do what you were told? It's a sign I'm maturing? --[GROANS] What are we going to do? Maybe we can fix it. "Maybe"? [CLEARS THROAT] Working late. That's good. You shouldn't be here, Stillwell. It's not safe. Well, I brought you a little present. I thought it'd make a good paperweight. What do you want? I've been thinking about your problem. You know, uh, you need a new architect. So that means you gotta get rid of this Baily guy. Why don't you let me handle it? I'll make him part of my big new construction project-- the foundation. No, not that. Maybe-- maybe if you just scare him off. Just a little. OK. Suit yourself. But I'm signing that contract on Saturday. It ain't Andrew Baily gonna stop me. Hm. Mhm. Any luck? Dad, I'm trying to use parts from my computer. It's gonna take a little while to match up the circuits. OK. I'm going to go get the paper. DOUG: Dad. What? Put a hat on or something. Yes, sir. Good idea. Will do. [YAWNS] Nice day. Wish I could have seen the sunrise. I can't even see me. Hmm, that paperboy needs to work on his pitching. Looks like you're gonna have some explaining to do, Mr. Baily. The Neighborhood Eye is watching you. Mr. Weiderman? Don't kill me! Don't kill me. What could be taking him so long? Weiderman, what are you doing down there? Don't kill me. ANDREW: I won't kill you. I'm gonna have you arrested for trespassing. MR. WEIDERMAN: Yeah, I was just taking pictures-- Uh, Dad, uh, it's time to take your medicine. Just what were you looking at, Weiderman? Nothing. I didn't see nothing. You're taking pictures for the tabloids? Wallowing in my misfortune, huh? Come on in, Dad. What were you looking at, Weiderman? Dad. Now. ANDREW: You didn't see anything, trust me. Well, what did he mean by that? Nothing, Dad. You think he knows something? This can't get out, Doug. I'll lose my job. Now sit here, and don't go anywhere unless I"m with you. I just wanted to read the paper. Just a normal day off. [MUTTERING AND CHUCKLING] Got him this time red-handed. Doing what? Getting the newspaper. Ought to get 30 years for that. No, I don't mean just getting the newspaper. I mean I caught him sneaking around in weird clothes. It's just not normal. Have you looked in the mirror lately? [MUTTERS] DOUG (VOICEOVER): Dad finally calmed down long enough for me to get some work done. And I needed the time. --[CLEARS THROAT] Hey, what do you want for dinner? Dinner? What time is it? It's almost 6:00. We gotta get ready. For what? We're going to Il Balcone's right? --[LAUGHS] I can't go out like this. Dad, you promised. OK, but I don't know what I'm going to wear. Leave that to me. Leave it to you? That's how I got this way in the first place. Nice place, son. You've got good taste. And what are you staring at? The nerve of some people. [LAUGHTER] Dad, there's Ms. Collier. Imagine that. Oh, it's a setup, eh? Wise guy. [LAUGHTER] Hi, there, how are you? Ooh, zucchini. Whoa, hey. [LAUGHTER] Take a picture. It'll last longer. [LAUGHTER] Wow, what a surprise. Um, Doug called me. Is everything OK? I have a sunburn. A bad one. Yeah, I was lying out in the backyard, and I fell asleep. My face is covered with cream. Cream. Cream! [LAUGHTER] Dad, they're laughing at you. Ignore them. Uh, waiter? Yes? We need some help here. You certainly do. [LAUGHTER] It's bee mask, Dad. I think it smells like bait or something. [LAUGHTER] What's so funny? Oh, I'm-- I'm sorry. It's just really hard for me to carry on a serious conversation with you in that outfit. Hey-- hey, Elephant Man! [SCREAMS WITH LAUGHTER] Excuse me? Oh, I couldn't possibly do that. [LAUGHTER] What do I have to do for service around here? Hey, what you got on under that hood? [LAUGHTER] Why, I oughta-- [LAUGHTER] Pardon me. I'll be right back. Maybe this was a bad idea. Not at all. Look, I'm flattered. Have you ever heard of Cyrano de Bergerac? He once helped a shy friend ask a girl out. So that's a true story? No, it's a book. And you're going to read it for me and write a report by the end of the week. Just think of it as extra credit. Oh, laugh at me, huh? Well, folks, you're in for your worst nightmare. [LAUGHS EVILLY] Uh, anybody here? OK. Ah, you never know where I might pop up. Ah, come on. Wonder what's keeping Dad. I don't know. [GRUNTING WITH EFFORT] [LAUGHTER] Time for a visit from the Invisible Dad. [LAUGHTER] Mind if I borrow this? Thank you. Ah. Careful, folks. Slippery when wet. [LAUGHTER] That ought to do it. [LAUGHTER] Thank you. Enjoy your meal. Target approaching. Now! Direct hit! [LAUGHTER] Get away! Oh my gosh! [WHINING LOUDLY] Away! Get away! [WEEPING LOUDLY] Oh, baby, aw, come on. Come, let's get outta her! You idiot! It's in my dress! [LAUGHTER] Uh, did I miss something? Oh, man, you should have seen it. I think maybe I did. Shall we order? I'm starving. [LAUGHTER] Mm, this is very good. Have some. [LAUGHTER] Julie? Are you sure Mr. Stillwell hasn't called? JULIE (ON INTERCOM): No. No one's called from Thunderbird Construction all morning. Thank you. We have a problem, Duncan. Andrew Baily just called to say he can't come in-- for the week. Was he hurt bad? He has a cold, Duncan. He says he can't come in under any circumstances, which means we don't have the blueprints for the new mall. Which means I lose the account and I go bankrupt. Let me take over the project. I'll save the firm for you. Wait a minute. I have it! If Andrew won't come to the office, we'll bring the office to Andrew. Artie, I want you boys to bring Baily's gear to his house. Drafting board, files-- everything. I want the company van loaded up and set to go in 15 minutes. OK? Good. [BANGING AROUND] Ow! [DOORBELL RINGS] Yeah, I'm coming, I'm coming. Ah, hi. How you feeling, Andrew? You sure you don't need some time off? Duncan, I feel lousy. I feel like somebody's been beating me up. But I'm staying on the job. Oh, I-- I wouldn't have it any other way. Hey, Artie, come in. ANDREW: Hey, Artie. Let me show you where to put those. Right through here. DUNCAN: Whatever you did to Baily, it didn't work. I didn't do anything to him yet. I been real busy. You didn't have him beaten up? Not yet. But I will. You let me worry about that. Uh, maybe he is sick. This-- this changes things. Baily's gonna be off for a week anyway, so you don't have to do anything. Problem solved. You take over the project, you hire my firm, I give you a big kickback-- one big happy family. It's not gonna be that easy. Whitmer's had the office moved to Baily's house. He's going to do the blueprints there. What planet are you from? Steal 'em. Put your name on them. I know a good forger. All you gotta do is taking photos of the blueprints. We'll take care of Baily later-- permanently. [KNOCK] [DOORBELL RINGS] Oh, I wonder who that could be. [GASP] Oh no! Who's at the door, Dad? Sandy! What is she doing here? Delivering pizza? -Hi, guys. -[LAUGHS NERVOUSLY] Hungry? Just thought you might like a pizza. Pepperoni! I don't know how to thank you. Well, um, maybe a kiss? Hmm, OK. But, uh, close your eyes first. It's more romantic that way. OK. [KISS] Mmm. You're a good kisser. Yeah, well. Can I open my eyes now? Ow! What was that? [GASP] [GASP] [THUD] Oh! Ohhh. Um-- DUNCAN: This is incredible. You're a genius. Well? What do you think? Perfect. I thought so. That'll be $1,000. [CACKLES] [CHUCKLES MEANLY] ANDREW: Sandy? I'm here-- I think. Sandy? Mmm. OK, you can open your eyes now, but don't pass out on me. Mm, I'll try. I'm just not used to this. (CHUCKLING) You're not used to it. Ooof. Would you mind explaining what happened? Well, Doug found this machine that turned me invisible. We're trying to correct the problem. Well, how's it going? Ah. Silly question. Sorry I asked. I'm worried I can't fix one of the circuit boards. Well, maybe I can go to the library and do some digging. You know, find out about the scientist who created this thing. If my head ever stops pounding. Well, anything would help. OK. [CLEARS THROAT] Did Baily send any blueprints yet? He didn't turn any in. Guess you can't trust a resume these days. I came up with some designs of my own. In case something happened to Baily, of course. You did these? I tried to match Baily's original concepts as close as possible. In a way, you could say he helped me, a little. Very impressive. Keep working, Duncan. If Baily doesn't deliver, we'll go with your design. REPORTER (ON TV): Well, now, why don't you walk us through your ordeal, Ms. Vail? How did the aliens abduct you? Well, I was just relaxing in my trailer, and then everything got all blurry. And the next thing I knew, aliens had taken me away. REPORTER (ON TV): That's certainly the most astonishing story I ever heard. Well, almost. What do you think they wanted from you? They're here to study us. REPORTER (ON TV): I see. See? Right on television. I told you it was true. I suppose that the Martians have a shortage of TV lifeguards. That's just a cover. Everyone knows what they need is women to repopulate their dying planet. Ooh, where do I sign up? Oh. REPORTER (ON TV): Aliens searching the globe for-- Ah, there we are. Ahh, what have we here? Popcorn. Uh, oh, I'm trying to quit anyway. REPORTER (ON TV): Shari, tell me, what did the aliens look like? Well, the alien creatures looked like little boys. They were really nice. But I know that they just wanted my body. REPORTER (ON TV): Well, I can certainly-- You know anything about that? She looks a lot better in person. Uh, did you find anything at the library? Oh! Yeah. Yeah, I did. OK, there were two Rivington brothers living in Oakmoor, identical twins, both science whizzes. Now J. Emerson Rivington, your inventor, was hired by the town fathers to create this self-igniting fireworks display for the 1972 4th of July celebration. Uh, he set the whole thing on top of the art museum. But he crossed a couple wires and darn near blew up Oakmoor. [BOOM] [BOOM] [BOOM] [BOOM] [BOOM] [FIRE CRACKLING] After that, he became a recluse. Locals believed he, uh, was still inventing his weird gadgets, right up until the day he disappeared. What about the other one? Oh, Gerald Rivington. He went to Africa and discovered rare gems. I guess he's still there. Hmm. [AFRICAN MUSIC PLAYING] [SOUNDS OF WILDLIFE] [SINGING] Oh, ho, ho, marvelous. Yes. This is a good haul, Algernon. You can see the stars in these. Came in yesterday's post, sir. GERALD RIVINGTON: News from home. Algernon, maybe I won't feed you to the lions after all. Very sporting of you, sir. Don't much like the lions, sir. But they like you. And get rid of that cigar! Take up a healthier habit. Right, sir. Mm, jolly good. Ah, good shot. There's a girl with meat on her bones. I wonder if that forger can do $100 bills. [LAUGHS] (SHOUTING) Yes! [LAUGHS] Your mother was beautiful. Sometimes when things get tough for Dad and I, I like to think she's watching over us. I'm sure she is. Everything ready? I guess we can give it a shot. Go ahead, son. Let's do it. [TYPING] [BEEPING AND WHIRRING] [PULSING BEEP] [SIZZLING AND CRACKLING] What's that noise? Oh, I had to jury-rig the power circuit. [BEEPING] I wish my dad was visible again. [PULSING BEEP] [SIZZLING AND CRACKLING] Something's wrong. Oh, no, it's overheating! ANDREW: Doug? I can't shut it off! Sandy, pull the plug! Ow! What happened? I guess the circuit wouldn't take the load. Well, can you fix it? I don't know. Well, it was a good try, son. You-- you did the best you could. I let him down. It's OK, Doug. I'll go talk to him. If only I had another 64-bit circuit. DOUG (VOICEOVER): It was time to take drastic action-- beg, borrow, or steal. Jimmy? JIMMY (ON PHONE): Hey, Doug, what's up? How would you like to skip school tomorrow? No way. My dad would kill me. Come on, Jimmy. This is important. You gotta help me find something. JIMMY (ON PHONE): I have a bad feeling about this. Great. Thanks. Bye. [LAUGHING QUIETLY] Ah, thank you. Stay out of that, Algernon. It's for grownups only. And get that cigar out of here! "The aliens had a machine that could transport me anywhere. Took me to a neighborhood in Oakmoor, California." Oakmoor? By all the angels in heaven, Brother Emerson's up to his old tricks! Algernon! Yes, sir? Get me on a plane to California. Now, sir? No, I thought next week. Oh, well, then I'll have time do a load of laundry down by the river. Yes, now! Right, sir. You ninny. Whatever the trouble is, I hope I'm not too late. DOUG: I can't believe nobody has that circuit board. JIMMY: I skipped school for this? Come on. This is the last place in town. I know. I'll keep an eye out for Mr. Wilson. 64-bit. That's it. Better get a second one for backup. Aha! Caught you red-handed. [LAUGHS MEANLY] [WHIMPERS] DOUG: Run, Jimmy! Call my dad! [CELL PHONE RINGING] Hello? ANDREW (ON PHONE): It's Andrew. Doug's in jail. Uh, OK. Uh, don't panic. I'll come get you. DOUG (VOICEOVER): Yep. I was sent up the river to the big house. Shoplifting's a serious crime, kid. DOUG (VOICEOVER): My life was over. 50 years' hard labor, or maybe even the chair. DOUG: I really messed things up for Dad. He always told me I was good at figuring things out, but this time I need help. Man, I knew something was wrong when Doug didn't come to school today. What would make him do a thing like this? Andrew, he feels responsible. Respons-- I'm responsible. I'm his father. I'm his parent. I'm transparent. Ah, look, you'd better go in and get him. They'll never let me in the room like this. OK. Uh, the stations that way. Go on, move, move! [SIGH] Mr. Wilson here is pressing charges. Looks like the boy was shoplifting in his electronics store. Come on, Sandy, what's the holdup? Look, Doug is only a minor. Since Mr. Wilson's pressing charges, I've got to hold the boy for the juvenile authorities. All right, that's it. It's time for a visit from the Invisible Dad. Detective, I know this boy. He's a student of mine. He wouldn't steal anything. Are you calling me a liar? No, I'm calling you blind and cruel. Listen, I dont' have to listen to this kind of thing. I've got rights, you know. Settle down, Mr. Wilson, or I'll throw you in the holding cell. Prevents dishpan hands. Why don't you just throw us all in a cell? Oh, why you-- I oughta knock the hell-- oh! You kicked me. No I didn't. And I've got a good mind to cite you for contempt. They kicked me. Didn't you see it? [THUD] You just kicked a police officer! No, no, no, I-- I-- no, no, I-- no, I didn't-- uh-- Come with me, Mister. I got a nice cell for you in the back. Oh no. Um, Detective? ANDREW: Hyah! Oh my god! Oh! Oh! [ANDREW LAUGHING] Look out, look out! I can handle it! ANDREW: Hyah! No! No! ANDREW: Here's a weapon for ya! Andrew? You in? ANDREW: Ah. OK. I'm in. But I'm not decent. [LAUGHS] Doug, what where you thinking? Well, I found a circuit board that I thought would work. I didn't know what else to do. ANDREW: You could have asked me for the money. Stealing is wrong for any reason. We could have all ended up in jail. Look, it's OK. He was just trying to help. ANDREW: I suppose we still need to find a circuit board for you? Nope. I picked up an extra one, just in case. ANDREW: That's my boy. We're outta here. ANDREW: And Doug, you're going to have to pay that man back, every penny. DOUG: Right, Dad. After I fix you. ANDREW: Right. After you fix me. I should have given you more credit, Duncan. You've given me the mall designs that I'd hoped to get from Andrew Baily. And hopefully saved our firm in the process. I can tell you that you will go far in this business. Thank you. Will you excuse me, dear? I have a phone call to make. See you at the meeting tomorrow. ANDREW: Ah, that was a close call. But I think the worst is behind us now. Doug, get to work on that circuit board. I got a good feeling about this. I think everything's going to be OK. Right, Dad. Do you need to finish your blueprints? Finished and delivered. Duncan came by and picked up the last batch yesterday. Boy, I'll bet Ms. Whitmer's going to be surprised when she sees those blueprints. Wow, I'm impressed. [PHONE RINGING] -Hello? -Andrew? Courtney Whitmer. ANDREW (ON PHONE): Oh, hi. Did you get the-- Let me make this short and sweet. You're fired. Fired? Me? COURTNEY (ON PHONE): When I hire an architect, I expect him to turn in work. Luckily for me, Duncan has created some of his own designs, and they're pretty darn good. They look a lot like your work, only better. And by the way, don't come around this office again, or I'll have your arrested for trespassing. Well, imagine that. I can't believe it. Who called? Your father was fired. I'm pretty sure that Duncan Gilbert Stole my work. It's the only possible explanation. And I can prove it. So all you have to do is show up at the presentation tomorrow. I said I could prove it. I didn't say I could show up at the presentation tomorrow. Any ideas? DOUG (VOICEOVER): Nope. At that point, I figured nobody knew how to fix my dad except Old Man Rivington. Or maybe his brother. [AFRICAN MUSIC PLAYING] Emerson, your brother's back from darkest Africa. Have you really returned from the grave? We'll see. He's back. He's back from the grave. Who? That big shot Big Chief Alien himself, Mr. Rivington. Rivington? Here. You need these more than I do. This is no time to fool around. [KNOCK] Hello there, young fellow. You're Gerald Rivington. That I am. Just a weary traveler looking for a bit of rest. Mr. Rivington, you've come to the right place. Awfully nice of you folks to let me visit. Old Brother Emerson was never much of a housekeeper, but you fixed it up nicely. Oh, almost forgot. I came bearing gifts. Genuine shrunken head from East Africa. Got it from a tribal chief for saving his son's life. It's supposed to bring you good luck and ward off your enemies. Makes a good paperweight, my boy. Let's see-- ah. [CHUCKLES] The mummy of a six-legged bandicoot. Native symbol for abundant food and hunting. Go good in your kitchen, Madam. Hmm. I don't know what this is, but it was cheap. [LAUGHS] Thank you. [CLEARS THROAT] Thank you. Um, so, what brings you to town, Mr. Rivington? I got a feeling that one of my brother's old inventions might be causing you a spot of trouble. Thought maybe I could help. [GULPING LOUDLY] Oh, yeah. So, what mischief have dear old Emerson got you into? ANDREW: Good evening, Mr. Rivington. I'm the Invisible Dad. My word. [GULP] [DOOR CLOSES] What is it, Artie? I know for a fact that you didn't draw those plans, Mr. Gilbert. Mr Baily did. Uh, that's-- that's stealing, and I don't think Ms. Courtney's gonna like that. Who's gonna tell her? Well, I am. Can you say for a fact that that's not my work? Well, um-- Sucker. Old Emerson never trusted the government. Said the US Patent Office was filled with thieves who would steal an invention-- ahh-- faster than a hungry cheetah. Wha-- what's that? With any luck, you'll be able to figure that thing out. ANDREW: What is it, Doug? I think I'm gonna get my dad back. Ah, I'd like that. Stillwell. The presentation's tomorrow at 10:00. Can you guarantee Baily won't show up? Leave everything to me. The boys'll be waiting out in front. He ain't going nowhere. Right, boys? DOUG (VOICEOVER): Once we had Rivington's diagram, things moved pretty quickly-- except for when Dad tried to help. ANDREW: So? Any luck, huh? Well, I think we might be able to see each other again. What are you-- now what are you taking it apart for? Are you sure that that's the right thing to do? Mr. Baily, could you make us some coffee? I think we're going to need it. Look, it's OK. Come on. We're just in the way. OK, OK. [ZAP] Oof! I thought you turned this thing off! I thought you did. Oh, I can't take this anymore. [MUTTERING] Andrew, you're worrying too much. Yeah, well, if those two don't get that machine fixed-- You know, Doug's taken a lot of responsibility for a 12-year-old. I think he's handling it pretty well. How are you doing? I find myself getting angry a lot. I don't know, maybe this invisibility thing is affecting my metabolism. Look, I'm going to lie down for a while. Maybe some sleep. Wire B to Circuit L. Circuit L. [TINY ZAP] By Jove, I like this. Just like when Emerson and I were young lads. He got the instructions and I handled the tools. [BIG ZAP] Aahh! But I didn't handle them very well. [SNORING LIGHTLY] Hey! Unh! Sleeping Beauty, get your lazy butt up. We got work to do. [YAWNS] Eh. ANDREW: [YAWNS] OK, let's see how they did. Ah, oh, well. Oh, good show, lad. Good show. [YAWNS] Well, good morning. Ah, we need coffee, black, and plenty of it. The machine'll be working in just a few minutes. Andrew? Hm? Put some clothes on. You've got a dastardly black-hearted villain to catch. On it. [CHUCKLES] [ZAP] Ooh! Didn't mean to touch that. Thunderbird Construction had this made for us. And they're very excited about coming aboard. Well, all right. Just make sure you hold them to their bid, Duncan. [MUFFLED YELLING] What was that? Don't worry. I-- I'll-- I'll check it out. [MUFFLED YELLING] [CLEARS THROAT] Well? DUNCAN: It was nothing. Just a rat. A rat. GERALD RIVINGTON: That should do it. Let's give it a shot. Ready, Dad? Fire it up. [BEEPING AND WHIRRING] We're up to full power. Let her rip. I wish my dad was visible again. [BEEPING AND WHIRRING] [PULSING BEEP] Aah. Oh no. ANDREW: Well, nice try, son. What was it? Not enough power? I don't know. I need time to think. I don't have any more time! I've got an idea. They don't know me. I'm thinking the same thing you are. You drive! OK. I wonder if the missing link is in the computer. Hmm. Have you seen Artie? He was supposed to help us set up the snacks. Not since yesterday. You know him. Tell me something, Duncan. How is it that everyone who works with you seems to disappear? Artie? Are you there? [MUFFLED GRUNTING] ANDREW: Wait for me. I'm right behind you. Hey, she's leaving. ANDREW: Ow! Ah! Stubbed my toe. Well, shouldn't we stop her? You see Baily in that car? No. Then keep your trap shut. We stay right here. What kind of car is that? Seen one in a magazine once. Automatic doors, made in Switzerland someplace. Ooh. Enjoy this, Duncan. You've earned it. May I have your attention, please? I have a mall I'd like to show you. [LAUGHTER] Please follow me. There's $50 grand in here, as soon as they sign. ANDREW: Oh! You turned the wrong way, I think. Wait, no. No, you didn't. SANDY: Will you shut up and let me drive? COURTNEY: Here at Whitmer Architecture, we're planning to revolutionize mall design. And it begins right here in Oakmoor. ANDREW: Straight ahead. Come on. Ooh. By the way, that's a great-looking outfit you got there, hon. Oh! Aah! ANDREW: Sorry. -It's OK. OK, where to? ANDREW: The conference room. And try not to let anybody notice you go in. Easy for you to say. COURTNEY: May I present Duncan Gilbert's new design for the Oakmoor Mall. Ooh. WOMAN: Very impressive. COURTNEY: Let's pause for some refreshments before we pass out the contracts. Please help yourselves. Hey, maybe Baily snuck out the back door. There's no back way out of there. [BEEPING AND WHIRRING] [PULSING BEEP] I've got it! What? The missing ingredient. Your father's future! Really? Yes, of course. Why, how could I be so blind? I should have thought of this beforehand. [GRUNTING] How many malls has your golden boy over there designed? This is his first. He's going to go far. Oh, yeah. I agree. (WHISPERING) Andrew? Are you in here? [SIGH] I made a fortune on these things. People out here use them in computers. Silicon Valley? I gave a box of them to Emerson. He must have used one in the machine. [GRUNTING] (WHISPERING) Any time, Andrew ANDREW: (QUIETLY) I'm right behind you. Oh! [LAUGHS QUIETLY] [GRUNTING] ANDREW: It's time for the Invisible Dad to go to work. And let's get rid of these real flowers and put in-- I got a good deal on some cheap AstroTurf. What the hell is wrong with you, Gilbert? Oh! [SCREAMS] [LAUGHS] Duncan! You're making me look very foolish! Now go and get cleaned up. Sorry about that, folks. Apparently our young genius just isn't feeling very well. I'd like to call your attention to the portfolios in front of you, if you could all pick up these investment portfolios on the table. ANDREW: Hi, there. Come here. I'll bet you didn't see that coming. [LAUGHS] Duncan, you are going to pay for what you stole from me. [PUNCHING SOUNDS] [LAUGHTER] Where are you? [SNEEZES] ANDREW: Duncan, I'm having a really bad week, and I'm gonna take it out on you. [LAUGHS] I don't know where you are, but stop. I'll-- I'll do anything. ANDREW: Good. Then I want you to march back into that conference room and tell them who really designed that mall. I can't do that. Stillwell's gonna kill me. ANDREW: Fine. Have it your way. Oh! [MOANS] [BEEPING AND WHIRRING] Power's at full load. I wish my dad was visible again. [PULSING BEEP] Yes! [LAUGHS] You've done it, boy! Now let's go find your father. All right! You using that suit? Come on. Let's do it. Looks like trouble. Let's go see what they want. Where's Andrew Baily? Don't make us ask you twice. Hyah! Oh! Hyah! En garde! Run, lad! Been practicing, huh? [FIGHTING GRUNTS] I'm gonna put you in a box and send you back to the Queen! [BEEPING AND WHIRRING] [TYPING] Boy, have I got a wish for you. Hey, you little-- oh! [GROANS] Oh! [PULSING BEEP] Yes! You didn't make them invisible, did you? Something much better. [SCREAMING] COURTNEY: As you can see, we have five-year matching municipal bonds, so your money will be protected. Just sign on the dotted line. Andrew, if you won't do something, I will. ANDREW: Drop those pens! Baily, what on Earth are you doing here? Can't you see we're in the middle of something? Duncan Gilbert is a fraud. He stole my designs in order to take over this project-- and hire this guy and his phony-baloney construction company, and thereby get a nice, fat payback. Can you prove it? Yes, I can. I hide my initials in everything I design. Dead center. COURTNEY: Yes, there it is. Hold it, Mister. Get out of my way. Aha! The payoff money! Get out of my way! SANDY: Look, it's Doug. Doug! ARTIE: I think you should take a look at this, Ms. Whitmer. COURTNEY: Gosh, this is what they were going to make Oakmoor Mall with? Uh-huh. Oh. Uh, sorry, folks. I just-- um, office politics. That's all right, ma'am. Ain't never had so much fun at a business meeting. [LAUGHS] We still like the design. You find a new construction company, and we can do business. Thank you. Clean this mess up, will you, Artie? Right away, ma'am. We never finished going towards [INAUDIBLE], did we? What's happened to Stillwell? Uh, he got away. But I don't think the cops'll have any problem finding him. Andrew, I owe you an apology. I'm sorry. I should have known better, had more faith in you. Ah-- oh! Oh! Uh-- ah! When would you like to come back to work with us? Uh, I'd like a couple of days of days off, if that's OK with you. My son hasn't been seeing enough of me. No problem at all. [SIGH] Let's go home. DOUG (VOICEOVER): Well, that's pretty much the whole story. Except for one the aliens finally caught up with Mr. Weiderman. Hello, neighbor! [SCREAMS] [LAUGHS] DOUG (VOICEOVER): We have never heard from him again. [LAUGHS Yes. Your cab's here. Oh! We'd better go. This is for you. You should have seen him run, like a little bunny rabbit running off into the bushes. [LAUGHS] I told you! I told you aliens were coming! One of them just tried to kill me in the back of Baily's yard! Oh, it must be the first wave of their invasion. MILDRED: You're wrong. The aliens aren't coming, dear. We're already here. [SCREAMS] Want me to put that in, too? I'll hang onto this for safekeeping. Are you sure you can't stay? No, thank you. I'm going back to the jungle. I need peace and quiet. Now, you take good care of that father of yours. Thank you, my dear. You're welcome. You ready? Just a second. What's the name? Shari Vail. [BEEPING AND WHIRRING] What's he doing? You'll see. Are you an alien, too? Ever see the sunrise over the Serengeti, my dear? Serengeti? I love Italian food! I know this great little place on Melrose. Oh, to the airport. And step on it. --[CHUCKLES] Hey, what you thinking? Well, back when we had the machine, we could've maybe-- Brought Mom back? Son, some things aren't meant to change. Some things are just meant to be. DOUG (VOICEOVER): We lived happily ever after, and all that. But sometimes I still wish my dad was invisible. ANDREW: Doug? This room is a mess! DOUG (VOICEOVER): Or maybe I wish I could be-- ANDREW: Doug, where are you? Doug? Oh, no. DOUG (VOICEOVER): The Invisible Kid. [LAUGHS] [MUSIC PLAYING]
