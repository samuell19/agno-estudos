You get to do the work and he gets to do-her. That's a mental image I was trying to avoid. So why would you help this guy? Because, he can be the me I can't. He can be the me she deserves. The one she wants. Has it ever occurred to you that you might be the one she wants. I'm not the one anyone wants. Besides, now I can at least be involved on some level with her romantically. Even though she's holding him, in a weird way she's kind of holding me too. And in another real-world not delusional way, she's not holding you. At all. It's better than nothing. I've had 10 years of almost nothing. I'll take what I can get. [phone beeps] If Cyrus helps a hot guy get a girl, even though Cyrus is in love with that girl, will that end well for him?

I will never lie to you again, I swear. Every once in a while I will go to the skate park and see a guy with his arm around a girl and get this wave of romantic feelings and think, why not me? So I'll rush home and change my shirt and check myself in the mirror. Tell myself today is day that I'm gonna do it. And then all I see is this. I remember why I don't allow a picture to be taken. But this time I'm not backing down. So here goes. I love you. Yeah, yeah, I know, you love me too. We're good friends. But I love you. Love you in the Princess Bride sense of the word. In a "I would bring down the stars and make a garden for you to read in" sense of the word. Even if we never speak again, I needed you to know that. So enjoy your epic blanket fort. You deserve it all, Roxy. ♪ ♪ [Bronwyn] I'm offering you two sheep. Two. For one stinking piece of oar. Don't be a jerk. You already have the longest road. I'm not going to give you oar so you can start building cities, willie nilly. Willie nilly? Really? Is that something that people who aren't in a retirement home say? Willie Nilly is making a comeback. Willie Nilly is going to be the name of my band. [phone text] [Lee] Two sheep and a wheat. Final offer. [Bronwyn] No, forget it. You get nothing. How's that, jerk. Cyrus, how about you. Two sheep for one oar? A simple no would have been fine, drama queen. Wanna make out? [water sprinkling] I'm realizing now there are only three words of all the words written in all the books in all the world. The only words that matter are "I love you." Your words, Cyrus. Not his. You memorized that way better than he did. Took days. You lied to me. Deliberately manipulated my feelings. I know, I know. I'm so sorry. I just wanted you to be happy. Well that guy who wrote those texts, I loved his soul, his wit, his passion. That was you. Was it all a lie? No. No not at all. I had to get it off my chest. I thought even if I, even if I wasn't the guy for you that I could feel what it would be like to be with you. Even with this giant thing on my face... Cyrus. It's just a nose. To you. To me it was a wall. A giant boulder blocking the gateway to everything that I ever wanted. Which is? You. Just, just you. It's always been you. I want to hear you say it in person. Don't make a joke. Don't make an excuse, just tell me. Did you mean what you sent me? Every word. You must be freezing. No. That's not why I'm shivering. ♪ ♪ Oh, no, no. Oh, yes, yes, yes. You're my guy now. Wooo yeah! [laughter] Oh my god! All wet over again. You're soaked! - Okay. - Okay. [camera click] [closing music] Oww! Mother... Jake... Yeah? Oops. Aghhh! Oh god! Get out. I, I, sorry. I had a hair in my mouth. So I'm all yeah right and she's all like no. So I put down the skirt I was going to buy which was super cute, BT dub and I text her yeah, and she was like, uhm, no. And I was like, uhm, yeah. And then she says no and I'm like...
