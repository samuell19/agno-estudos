Are you two sitting comfortably? Good. Now, gentlemen. Do you see these file folders? The ones with your names on them? Can you guess what's in these file folders? I'll give you a hint. Discipline reports. Lots of them. And some wonderful artwork as well. This is... Spider with human head? -I'm sorry. Spider? -BOY: With human head. Yeah. He eats dogs and cats and rabbits. -Does he? -Sean thought him up. You see, sir, we kinda have this monster club, okay? And we draw those pictures to put on our clubhouse walls. Correction, Mr. Crenshaw. You draw pictures during Mrs. Carlsen's science class when you are supposed to be paying attention. Wait. I just want to say one thing. I mean, Ms. Carlsen's a nice teacher and all, but she's boring and has an odd-shaped head. That's why Sean and the guys call her "Meow Mix," cause her head's shaped like a cat head. But I don't, sir, 'cause how rude. (CHUCKLES) Boys, I hear you. (CHUCKLES) I was a kid once. I thought monsters were cool. And maybe, well, well, gosh, maybe I'm just a big kid, because, Sean, Patrick, I think science is cool. I dig it, man. (LAUGHS) Now, I'm sure both of you know a great deal about monsters, but that's not the issue here. The issue is science is real. Monsters are not. We don't know that, sir. God, can you believe Mr. Metzger? Tell me about it. He touched me and patted my shoulders and stuff. -The guy was fully homo-ing out. -I smell like the '40s. I mean, when they send you to school, why don't they tell you about the homos and the people with cat heads? -(GRUNTS) -WOMAN: Oh! Sorry, Mrs. Carlsen. -Meow. -She's married, Sean. Oh, my God! Some guy kisses her at night? I mean, a priest said, "I now pronounce you man and wife," and it was okay with him? Hey. Where's Fat Kid? Good evening, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to our show. Tonight's question, what makes Fat Kid fat? -Fat Kid? -Get out of here, E.J. -"Get out of here, E.J." -Nope. -Not a good answer. -Doesn't make any sense. Let's go to our man on the street. Derek. Hi, I'm Derek, and I'm in the street where Fat Kid is blocking traffic. Fat Kid, can't you stop eating? Look, I have a glandular problem, okay? At least I don't have a stupidity problem. -What'd you say, faggot? What'd you say? -My name's Horace! -(LAUGHS) Horace. -Whore-ass. Oops. I tore it. I guess I must have a stupidity problem. -Such assholes... -What'd you say, faggot? What'd you say? I said, "You're an asshole." (GRUNTS) (ALL SHOUTING) Hey, Rudy. E.J. I see you met my friend Horace. RUDY: You okay? -Rudy, I, uh... -Shh... -You dropped your candy bar, E.J. -It's his. RUDY: It's yours now. -Rudy... -Eat. -Rudy, I'm not gonna... -Eat up! And we'll call it a day. ALL: Ew! SEAN: Look, Patrick, I told you before, -Wolfman cannot drive a car. -PATRICK: Yes, he can. -SEAN: No, he can't! -PATRICK: Yes, he can. All I'm saying is, Sean, he could if he had to. He could not. You're being such a dork! -I know you are, but what am I? -A dork. I know you are, but what am I? -Oh, great... A dork. -I know you are, but what am I? -A dork. -I know you are, but what am I? Infinity! Look, Wolfman doesn't go to work. -He's not, like, a guy. -What are you talking about? He walks around. He wears pants. He had to wear pants 'cause those movies were made in the '40s. He had to wear 'em so you wouldn't see his wolf dork. Wolf dork? GIRL: You guys! I saw him. He was watching us. -Who? -Scary German Guy. -Sean, he give me the creeps. -He's just a dude on welfare. -Maybe he's a German spy. -SEAN: Oh, good one. We're not at war with Germany anymore. -GIRL: We're at war with Vietnam. -What? It's in Rambo. -You guys missed it! -Oh! Fat Kid! Rudy saved my life! Do you think we could talk him into joining the Monster Club? Can we? -Huddle. -Huddle. Sean, he's in junior high. GIRL: I heard he killed his dad. Get out of here, Phoebe the Feeb! Okay, you guys. We should let him in on one condition. ALL: Monster test. You guys! I saw Scary... I saw him! I saw Scary German Guy! He was watching! -MAN: I'm depressed. -What for? What do you mean, what for? I'm flyin' a World War II bomber with wooden crates in it and dead bodies. I should have a party? Do they complain? Do they get airsick? Do they ask for more of the little almond things? You're right. This is a great job. I'm really happy. (THUDDING) -I thought they were dead. -They are. I'm going to, uh... I'm gonna check it out. Okay. Good. You do that. I'll stay here and make spooky sounds. (RAT SQUEAKING) -(GASPS) -(BAT SCREECHING) (YELLS) Come on. Come on. Come on. Where are you, you son of a bitch? (MAN GRUNTS) (SHOUTS) (SQUEAKING) (SCREECHES) FAT KID: Two ways to kill a vampire. SEAN: Good one, Fat Kid. Excellent question. RUDY: Stake through the heart. -SEAN: Right. -PATRICK: What else? -BOY: Oh, real good. -SEAN: Eugene. EUGENE: I wasn't talking. It was Pete. FAT KID: Get him a muzzle, will ya? RUDY: You guys meet up here a lot, or, uh... -SEAN: Every day. -EUGENE: Do we meet up here a lot? -SEAN: Eugene! -EUGENE: Man! SEAN: Eugene, make Pete shut up. EUGENE: Do you really think that was a good question? SEAN: Rudy! Are you gonna listen or look out the window? PATRICK: I told you he didn't want to be in the club. FAT KID: Lighten up, Patrick. RUDY: No way! SEAN: Hey, we're tryin' to do the test here, you know. FAT KID: You're gonna piss him off. RUDY: I'm beginning to like this club. Rudy! Come on. It's a monster test. It's important, okay? Second way to kill a vampire. Mm... I give up. -Daylight. -Sunlight. (LAUGHS) Fat Kid, what other kind of light is there during the day? Go away, Pete! Question two. Is Frankenstein the name of the monster -or the guy who made him? -The guy. -Right. -(KNOCKING) Can't you read? Mom said you have to let me in the club, or else it's "prescruption." That's discrimination, jerkoid. "Prescription" is drugs, which you're on if you think you're getting up here. Come on, Sean! I know about monsters. Come on! Let me in the club! Two ways to kill a werewolf. -Silver bullet? -And? That's it. Shoot him with a sliver bullet. -Nope. Sorry, Rudy. -(LAUGHS) Okay, so what's the other way? -What? -Second way to kill a werewolf? -Um... -Car crash? -Accident with power tools? -Old age? Falling out a window. Onto a bomb! WOMAN: Sean! Phoebe! Dinner! Oops. Gotta go. Wait. Am I in or what? -(MAN SPEAKING ON TV) -I mean it, spaz. PHOEBE: You gotta stop it. Uh-uh! Wash up for dinner, guys. -Boring guy, boring guy, boring guy, boring guy. -What's this, Mom? Huh? Oh, I got that for you today at Jane Burgess' garage sale. Says it's from that old house up on Shadowbrook Road. Holy shit! Uh, cow. I'm sorry. Mom, do you know who wrote this book? Yeah. It's, what, Van Helsing something. Now, he's the one that fights Godzilla, right? -Dracula, Mom. -Well, then which is the really tall one? That's Godzilla. My God! Abraham Van Helsing. This is great! (LAUGHS) This... This is German. (THUNDER RUMBLES) Let it begin. (THUNDER CRASHES) Hey, slick. Busy day? Not really. -Shoot any crooks today? -Afraid not. But I still may if you don't wash up for dinner. -What's on your mind? -Well, Dad, some of the guys and me were maybe gonna go see Ground Hog Day Part 12 tonight, only if it's okay with you. -Is it? Please? -Oh, we got a problem. -No way! -Yes, way. I gotta go out with your mother tonight. You got a certain five-year-old sister who needs babysitting. Oh, come on, Dad! I've waited all year to see this movie! Easy, pal, it's only a movie. Look, tomorrow night, you and I will go see Ground Hog Day. I'll get home early. Tomorrow night? That'll be too late! The guys will blab the entire plot! Plot? Did I hear "plot"? Sean, it is a guy with an ax. Anyway, I thought they killed him in the last one. They did. And he returns from his grave. Returns from the grave? Sean, he always returns from the grave. If they blew him up, put his head in a blender, and mailed the rest of the pieces to Norway, he would still return from the grave. That was part seven. You want to know what the plot is? The plot separates you from my five bucks. I want to see a stupid movie. Well, you can't. You're babysitting. -Fine. Can I have five bucks anyway? -Absolutely. -So where you two going tonight? -Marriage counselor. Again? I thought you quit smoking. Sean. Son, I love you dearly, but do me a favor. -Put your basic lid on it. -(PHONE RINGS) Now, get outta here. Hello. Yeah? MAN: Officer, please! Lock me up! Lock me up! -I'm a werewolf! I'm a werewolf! -Hey, Del. -MAN: I know it sounds crazy, but... -Bad news. Listen, I gotta go downtown. Can you reschedule that appointment? Honey, I'm a cop, okay? You knew that when you bought the package. -Look, it's important. -I'm important. -I love you. -Prove it. I'll see you in a few hours. MAN: Just for a night! You see, it's a full moon! -And I'm a werewolf! -COP: Take it easy. MAN: You don't understand! You gotta lock me up! -You gotta put me in a cage! -I'd like nothing better! Hold onto your pants! Oh, God! You don't understand! You've gotta... Anything you say, fella. -(GRUNTING) -MAN: Put the cuffs on him. MAN 2: I got it. All right. I got him now. -(YELLING) -Jesus Christ! We need some backup! (SCREAMING) -(GUNFIRE) -Lock me up! So, let me get this straight. You tellin' me there was this 2,000-year-old mummy here, right? -Yes, sir. -Well, now he's not here. -He's gone. Vanished. History. -Yes, sir. And you're saying you didn't hear anybody come in here or leave. Is that right? Can you hear me now? Hello? -MAN: I can hear you fine. -So nobody took the mummy. -I would've heard them. -Of course he would've. What a stupid question. -Did you take him? -No, sir. Just a shot. That's it, Del. This case is too hard, man. Let's be firemen instead. I'm glad you're getting major laughs out of this, Rich. The problem is, 2,000-year-old dead guys do not get up and walk away by themselves. WOMAN OVER RADIO: Accident patrol, request confirmation. You have the 915-H officer-involved shooting en route? (ROCK MUSIC PLAYS ON RADIO) (CREAKING) (MUSIC CONTINUES ON HEADPHONES) (GROWLING) (SCREAMING) WOMAN ON SCREEN: My God! You scared me! MAN: Where are Steve and Judy?

That makes two tonight, right, Lieutenant? Ha-ha. That's very funny. Now, you want to shut up about it?

Your mom did this when you were a little girl? Uh-huh. It means "I love you." And as long as it's here, nothing bad can happen. Sean says when it lightnings, monsters come. Oh, he's just trying to scare you, honey. -Will lightning hit the house? -No. -The candle keeps it away? -That's right. Say goodnight to Scraps. -Good night, Scraps. -(HIGH-PITCHED) Good night, Emily. Good night, sweetheart. Are you gonna yell at him? Honey, I love your father. What? I mean Sean, for scaring me. Of course you did. I'll talk to him about it, sweetheart. Sweet dreams. EMILY: You're thinking about your job, isn't that right? I can see it in your eyes, Del. DEL: Yeah! I'm glad you can see it in my eyes, cause for a minute there I thought I had you fooled. Come on, this isn't... No, come on! Look at my eyes! Look at my eyes! I'll think about stuff, and you can tell me when I'm thinking correctly! EMILY: Keep your voice down. I don't want the children... DEL: I had a lousy night, all right? EMILY: Every night I have a lousy night. DEL: I'm sorry it's such a pain in the ass for you with my stupid little job! I am trying to explain... DEL: Some guy steals a priceless Egyptian mummy... That happens every day. Skip that. Then I get a call from some nutcase who's shouting he's a werewolf! You like that? What do they do? They blow him away right there in the police station! Wait a minute! There is more to this! (CONTINUES, INDISTINCT) DEL: ...marriage counseling! For what? (SHOUTING INDISTINCTLY) (THUNDER CRASHES) (THUNDER CRASHES) -What? -There's a monster in my closet. Damn, son, look! All of these monsters! Come on, all of you monsters, outta here! Everyone, out of this room! Come... Ah! You, on the bed! Come on! Out! Out! Take a hike! There he goes. (SIGHS) You see any more monsters? In the closet? Sure. We can go into the closet. We can do that. Okay, monsters! Ooh! Look at that big, scary monster! Ooh! Listen. You are not gonna sleep with your mother and me tonight, so you can forget it. And keep this up, and you're not gonna look at those monster magazines. Understand? Uh... Okay. We're all here. What's the deal? Yeah. What the hell's Monster Squad? It's us. We're the Monster Squad. -Since when? -Since now! -What's a "squad?" -It's like Miami Vice, I think. Look, I think there's monsters. Like, real ones. I heard my dad talking on the telephone to a guy down at the police station. There was a guy screaming he was a werewolf. And they shot him. And the body disappeared from the coroner van. And the coroner guy was dead. So what? He got shot, and the werewolf took his body? No, you pinhead! He was a werewolf! Maybe. -But if they shot him... -They must've been regular bullets, not silver ones. Look, I know this will sound pretty stupid, but a mummy disappeared from the museum tonight. Mummy came in my house. And guys, Dracula might be here, too. Aw, man, Fat Kid farted! -Did not! -Can't you hold it? God! Goddamn it, would you shut up? Did you hear a word I said? The guys are dead! Get a clue! Something's out there, and it's killing people! And if it's monsters, nobody's gonna do a thing about it but us! So, what do we do? Think this book might be important. Look, it's Van Helsing's diary. My mom said they found it in an old house on Shadowbrook Road. But I can't read it. It's all in German. My sister takes German in high school. Your sister doesn't speak German. All she does is hang around and let guys touch her tits. Your sister wouldn't happen to live next door, would she? -So what? -That girl's your sister? So, what do you say? Are we Monster Squad or what? -Cool. -All right. RUDY: How does that dog get up here, anyways? (THUNDER CRASHES) (WATER DRIPPING) Old friend. How do you like your new home? Home. I must sleep soon, so listen very carefully. Van Helsing's diary is missing. I want you to retrieve it for me. -You understand? -Yes, Master. Children possess it. I want you to find them and take the diary. If they do not cooperate, you will kill them. FAT KID: Gentlemen, I'd just like to say three words, Scary German Guy. Who else are we gonna get to translate this thing? Come on. Somebody go up and knock. You knock. You're our leader. Firstly, he's scary, okay? And "B," he's German. Maybe he doesn't even speak English. Okay, so what's German for, "Please don't murder us"? (MAN SPEAKING GERMAN) (HUMMING) (RASPY BREATHING) Boys, time is almost up. It's your last chance for pie. -FAT KID: Thanks, mister, uh, guy. -Now, here we go. FAT KID: I mean... SEAN: No, thanks. So? Now, where were we? Ah, ja. "The amulet itself is fairly small "and carved with intricate symbols." Oh. Rather an odd-looking thing, don't you think? Scary German Guy's bitchin'. SEAN: Sir, the thing I don't understand is the part about the equilibrium. MAN: Well, according to this rather curious book you have brought me, "The forces of good and evil..." -That is a B-17, in case you are wondering. -It's rad! "Good and evil are in constant flux, back and forth. "Only once, every hundred years, are these forces balanced." And what about the amulet? The amulet, so nearly as I can translate, is "concentrated good." "It is a talisman which wards off evil and is..." How you say, uh, "indestructible"? That means it can't be destroyed. MAN: Or, in any case, normally destroyed. However, and this part is underlined, "Once every hundred years, "at the stroke of midnight, "the amulet becomes vulnerable, "and at that moment, it can be shattered." And if it is? Then the balance between good and evil will shift, and evil will rule. However, our friend Mr. Van Helsing claims there is a way to stop the forces of darkness. How? "If one could gain possession of the amulet "before those forces, "then every hundred years, at midnight, "there is another option. "A ceremony, which, when followed to the letter, "will open a hole into Limbo itself "where dwell the damned, "a vortex, which like a great whirlwind, "can swallow the forces of evil forever." Well, does it describe the procedure at all? In detail. This was the last entry. On this date, he was to battle those forces himself. Interesting. It is tomorrow's date, one hundred years ago! A hundred years ago? Tomorrow night. -Thank you very much. -Thanks. Bye. Thank you very much for all your time. Thank you. I expect you boys thought I was some kind of monster myself? Hm? A vampire, perhaps? That's quite all right. But I am not, you know. If I were a vampire, then I wouldn't have a reflection. Now, would I? Man, you sure know a lot about monsters. Now that you mention it, I suppose I do. FAT KID: Guys, wait up! Tomorrow night? What do we have to do again? -Blow a hole in Dumbo? -Limbo, stupid. So how do we know the amulet's there, anyway? Because, you dweeb, Dracula's obviously here looking for it. If we don't find it before he does, we're beast bait. Okay, so say we get the amulet. Then what? -Wait till midnight, and? -We get a virgin. -A virgin? -Yeah. Okay, right. Then what? Well, our virgin takes the amulet, reads the magic spell from the book, and, blamo, we blow a hole in Limbo. -That's so easy. -Oh, a cinch. Piece of cake. Yeah. (ROCK MUSIC PLAYS) -Rudy. Question. -Shoot. Know any virgins? SEAN: Okay. Rudy, find some silver bullets. RUDY: Where the hell am I supposed to find silver bullets? -Kmart? -I don't know. Gimme a break. SEAN: Fat Kid, get a map. Find Shadowbrook Road. FAT KID: What, do I look in the index for "big, scary mansion?" -SEAN: Oh, you're a riot. -You guys! How can we trust Scary German Guy? Why would he lie about a thing like this? -Sean! -Phoebe, handle life, okay? You're being a spaz! Ow! God! You bit me, you brat! -I'm telling Mom on you! -Would you look? PHOEBE: It's okay, you guys! He's friends with us! Come on! Don't be chickenshit! Come on. I want to show you my friends. -Sean, no. -Oh, go for it. FAT KID: Sean, are you crazy? That's a walking dead guy. PATRICK: Sean, please don't die. Are... Are you dead? Dead? Does Mom know about him? No. Only us. Hey, guys, get over here! He's great! Now can I be in the Monster Club? I can't believe it. Frankenstein's monster in our clubhouse. PATRICK: Let's ask him to leave, okay? SEAN: You're not still scared, are you? Well, he is a little bit gross, Sean. Scraps. -I taught him to talk. -Bogus. Give me... ...a... break. Huddle up, you guys. Sean, we gotta get an adult. And your dad's a cop, so if we get your dad... SEAN: Absolutely no grownups, okay? They'll lock him up in a cage or something. -Dissect him. -FAT KID: Or put him on TV! -Fat Kid. -(LAUGHTER) Why are you such a lameoid? FAT KID: You're the lameoid. Bogus! Bogus. RUDY: Dudes, check it out. (WHIMPERING) (STAMMERS) Scary? (DOG BARKING) The amulet is near. Very near, yes. Oh, Van Helsing, your disciples were very clumsy, trying to hide from me the very thing that is mine. No hiding, never, from me. Ah! It's here! (GRUNTING) My prize.

Scary house, real monsters, us, 12 years old, remember? Midnight, end of world, remember? Master is near. Master wants children dead. FAT KID: Um, Sean?
