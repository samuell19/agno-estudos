I sell only fashion clothes. What I have here today one can find only in shopping malls. Irrational. The soul of the world is irrational. Creation is language. I'm serious about it. Nothing more than language. But all of a sudden we don't even know who we are. We can't hear the inside nor read the outside. Closed up in our shells we go dumb. The origin of the word "dumb" is in the word "private". Each one of us has become private. We no longer share the common knowledge of creation. The nature of things has the habit... of hiding itself. "INSPIRED IN 'JO?O DE CAMARGO FROM SOROCABA... THE BIRTH OF A RELIGION'... BY JOS? CARLOS DE CAMPOS SOBRINHO AND ADOLFO FRIOLI." Jo?o? Hey, Jo?o? Go, go! Hey, Jo?o! Go! Hey, Jo?o! Are you going mad, man? I don't know. I close my eyes and I see so many things. My head seems to be full of voices. You have to get real. Talking to spirits is no good! There are too many things we don't understand, Cirino. Stop that, Jo?o. Let 's drive on the herd, we'll arrive today. We're just like those mules... going where the whip tells us to. But the whip is now in our hand, Jo?o. On the farm, it 's in the master's hand. Aren't you aware yet that slavery is over? - But for us very little has changed. - Lf it hasn't, Jo?o, it will. What if we went back to Africa? Forget about Africa. Are you mad, man? We were born here, this is where we have to live, Jo?o. - Sarav?! - Sarav?! SOROCABA END OF XIX CENTURY The fair has come! The fair has come! The fair has come! - The mules are all here. - Thirty-five altogether. One fell into a ditch and another died of fever, Master. It 's always like that, I understand. Master, we'd like to have a word with you. We like you very much, but we're free now. - I see. - We'd like to live our own way. I see. You're no longer slaves. Brazil has no more slaves. We're a free men's republic. - Do you want to be free? - That 's our point. - Do you wanna be Brazilians? - That we are. You'll have to prove that fighting for Brazil, defending the republic. No, I just wanted to get mother at the farm and leave. You'll present yourselves to the military regiment as volunteers. You'll fight next to Marshal Floriano, in Itarar?... for the government, against the federalists. I gave my word that I'd send my men. Don't disappoint me. It used to be better. Mules and niggers were all that we needed. I heard say Princess Isabel did not free the mules from slavery... ...only the niggers. - Yes... but the steam engines are coming. The trains will do the mules' work. Brazil is too big. By the time the trains get where only mules reach, we'll be dead. But what are we going to do with the niggers? Look at those women! This is livin', ain't it, fella? I won't ever go back to that farm and stay there stuck in that hole. - But we gotta go to war. - No way. War is white men's thing. We get clothes, a rifle, a place to sleep, food... ...and even money! - The bearded woman. Come you all! The most exotic harem in the world! Yeah, fella, but what if we get a bullet in our guts? Jo?o, we only have to stay out of sight. And that 's the excuse we need to see the world. But the world is so confusing. That is exactly what we need. In war, we'll see only stinky men. Look at those women! Lift your skirt, woman Don't let It get wet The skirt cost money Money was hard earned Lift your skirt, woman Don't let It get wet The skirt cost money Money was hard earned Yeah, Jo?o! Walk like a man, Jo?o. I prefer barefoot. Come on, Jo?o. Let 's go and see this republic thing. Wait, fella. This is not something to throw away. A brand new pair of boots. - What do we do now? - Forget it. It wasn't that bad. We stayed there out of sight, like two dumb asses. We didn't even fight. There wasn't no war, no death. Much better that way. No more fighting, no more marching... no more sergeants or mud. We've already paid the master's price. Now, Jo?o, we are free! I'll take a bath, Jo?o. Let 's see what we can do for the girls of this town. Buddy, I'll go get my mother at the farm, but I'll come back. Go with God. Your blessing. Jesus Christ blesses you, Son. I've come for you, Mother. My stuff is all packed, Son. But you didn't kill anyone, did you? No, there was no need. But didn't the master send you to war, Son? Yes, Mother. But afterwards he changed sides. And what side are we on, Son? We're upside down, Mother. Efung?, Efung?, Manam?! Send me Alfredinho! It 's the boy's cross. It happened when you were a boy, like him. Alfredinho liked running against the wind, he wanted to ride heaven. And that's where he went to. Sad things happened here, but this can be a place of great happiness. Pray, Son, pray. He'll come back to help us. But wasn't he white? Alfredinho is a child-spirit, and they have no color. You know, Mother, I'd like to go to the town, back to Sorocaba. There are so many things to do and see... so many people and festivities. - I'm old, Son. - Nonsense. You can pray and cure "cachapurra". You can even cure "mafamburra". But one mustn't sell that, Son. There must be a beautiful place, a corner of the world for us. Mother, the world has no corners. It does. Ask that boy. - Where's the corner of the world? - It 's in Cafund?. I've come to see you I've come to get you Where are you? Come over here Oxal? and Ox?ssi receive us. Look at him and say they may stay. Nod. The circle has turned. Can they stay? - Ever seen armadillo climb a stick? - That's a lie - And a monkey fall off a branch? - Only you have seen that - And a waspon a rump? - That sure is hell! Oh boy! Is it true you've been in the war? Yes, but I didn't fight. - Have you ever traveled by train? - Yes. It feels good. You... And have you been with a woman? I don't know. Your mind always seems to be somewhere else. - I know, thoughts can fly. - I wish I could fly like that. Mother, this is fresh cow's dung. It seems like "mafamburra", and I thought he was my friend! - So was he your friend? - Yes. - A good friend? - A good friend. A good friend, but an enemy's friend. Enemy's friend. Good cleansing. Yes, but he was a friend... Friend and "unenemy". "Unenemy". Son, Oxal? will protect you against all evils. Are you leaving? Mother is well here. Look after her. And aren't you well here? I am, but there has been an itch itching me for a long time. And where are you gonna scratch yourself? Out there. Who are you? What are you doing here? Where do you work? I was just lookin'. I'm lookin' for work. - What can you do? - I can grow cotton, sugarcane... help in the kitchen. I know how to look after animals too. There are no donkeys here, man. Nor kitchen. This is a factory. Go away! I already told you. Take this fellow outta here! Go away, scram! I don't want niggers looking for work here! Just look at him. All fucked up. He looks like a wretched dog. I've heard say the textile factory needs people to pit cotton. - Out, you bums! - Let go! Go away! Bums! Bums! Ah, son of a bitch! I curse you, devil! - It will be difficult this way. - The problem is we can't even read. I'm much better than the whites at lots of things. One day, I'll find someone who appreciates me. What you can do well is the old in-and-out thing. These whites have never tasted my cookin'. Iwent to the beach There was a gale But It was so strong That my love didn't show up Let 's go. Thieves, thieves, thieves! Take this. - Look. - What 's that? - Banana! - A banana is what you are! I didn't pay anything. A woman gave them to me. Come on, let 's go, let 's go. - Here you go. - Am I a monkey to eat banana? Stop picking on the boy. Let him eat! - Have some grub! - Grub! Hi. Hey, Jo?o, at last. The water from the well is so bad that a dog won't drink it. And you know, in a white house, the blacks are always to blame. You mustn't complain. You are in a good house, with good food, a good bed. That 's what you think. That bastard Teodoro used to say he'd make me a queen. I'm still waitin'! What about me? I sleep in a cold shed and make almost no money. Bangalafuminga! You idle dog. Can you cook? Manoel? Where have you been, Manoel? The guests are arriving, and you're not ready. I've come for my collar that was being ironed. Do you think I don't notice your shameless behavior with that nigger? - What are you talking about? - Get in quick! Levinda, Levinda! Why isn't the table set? - I'm still ironin'. - Shut up! Useless, idle nigger! They've given you freedom, but no intelligence. Go back to work! I'm keeping an eye on you! Anything wrong, and you're out! "Useless, idle nigger". That dried up vulture! Devil! I'm up to here with that snake! Careful, Levinda, she almost saw everything. Maybe she did. No more takin' offense from bad people. This is no place for us, Jo?o. Teodoro has better plans for me. - These ones. - What happened? They burnt. We got our things and stormed out. Thank you. Let 's go. I've come to see you I've come to get you Where are you? Come closer I've come to see you I've come to get you Where are you? Come closer Come on! Take this to mother. She's always wanted a pair of scissors. Tell her I always ask for her blessing, ok? - Are you on your way? - To Cafund? we go! - Hey, Jo?o! - Hey, fella. So we meet again! - Today's Congonlese Kings' festival. - Our Lady of the Rosary's too. It 's gonna be good! Ain't it good to have money, Jo?o? There'll be lots of pretty girls. - But only that? - Yeap. And nothing for you, nigger. Say something I can understand. Speak properly, nigger! Out! You're fired! You stinky, shameless niggers! Bastards! Let 's go. Let 's go. This man is full of sorcery. He will do evil. I don't like that. So, puppet, tell me what to do to get that pretty girl. She's not for the likes of you. - That 's what you think! - We'll see. - What 's your name? - Ros?rio. Ros?rio? It 's a saint 's name. Yeah. Maybe I can operate miracles. Come! Come! - Can you hear that? - What is it? A slave's ghost pounding his pestle. - Up there, in the chapel! - May God give him rest. - It 's coming! - What? The pestle! It 's coming down! Come on! Come on quickly! Do you know the sea? No. Would you take me there? To the sea... Hey, Jo?o, come here. Come here! Are you deaf? Don't stay there. Let 's get out of here quickly. - What 's goin' on? - The foreman got killed. - Who did it? - Dunno. It must be Exu's doin'. Any nigger will do in the absence of a culprit. - I'm not goin' back there. Come on! - Calm down, Cirino! We'd better find another job, Jo?o. I've met a lass, Cirino. Run, Jo?o. The police! - I met her at the festival. Pretty. - Shut up, Jo?o! I think I'll get married. I know about a good piece of land. If you want... Sure! Hey, buddy! Take me to some hidden place. - This is no life for me. - Ros?rio... Life will get better. This is our first harvest. This is the end of the world! I miss people, music, noise... the city. We'll go. In two or three moons, we'll be going there. - Why so much desolation? - It 's the plague. People die daily. Who's that? He looks like a vulture! Don't say that. He's the only one who's come to help us. - All the rich folk have run away. - Please... come and see my son who's dying. - I think I know him. - Monsignor Jo?o Soares. A saint! Can I have some water? Don't you prefer something else? A very beautiful woman. And smells good too. Shackin' up with a nigger. What a waste. The corn is good today, Mr. Sebasti?o. - I don't have any money today. - No money? - No. - Look here... Let me read your palm, dear. Spit, spit. Rub it up! Dear, what a mess. Let me read your cards. Paloma, Paloma Everybody calls me Paloma I call you a sister, a lady But who can fearyour leaving The little dove is quite naughty. Worse than Pombajira. - The sheets and thorns away - You enjoy a sweat smell, huh? You can't fool me, bitch! Spanish kings' woman! Ros?rio, shall we go? It 's yellow fever. You'd better go home. Things around here are no good. - And you? - I'll go see mother. The plague is everywhere. Let 's go. It 's Omolu's punch. It 's the end of times! - Let 's go, Ros?rio. - Bitch! Mother? Ros?rio! Damned! Get out of here, son of a bitch! Go away! Damned! 19OO. The world is going to end. It 's going to end on the street, on the moon. In the sky, in the air. It 's going to end. We won't miss it. There won't be anyone left to cry for it. The day's coming! It 's the beginning or the end of the agony. Happy new year! It 's the end of the world! It 's already ended. Ain't this all God's punishment? - God doesn't punish. - Why is life so miserable, then? Secrets of God's face. What 's God's face like? It must be disturbing, Son... as it carries all the mysteries of the universe. - What's God's face like? - It must be disturbing, Son... as It carries all the mysteries of the universe. One more. It 's enough for today, Mr. Jo?o. You can barely stand up. You've drunk too much! You don't even look like the hard-worker you've always been. You just stand there. And all because of a prostitute who would go from one man to another. Mr. Jo?o, find yourself a girl of your own color. Black with white has never worked out. Where are you going? Drunk like that you'll drown out there. Come on, Jo?o! Come, Jo?o! Where are you goin', fella? Haven't you seen a boy on a horse? A soul without a body? He climbed up Xang?'s quarry, Son. So, that 's where I must go. Hasn't your mother taught you to ask Exu's permission? I'm sorry, I didn't recognize you. Excuse me. - You goin', but you comin' back. - Sure. You'll go up, but you'll come down. I will! I'll be back, Exu. Go, go! You were born again, Jo?o. Because of your humbleness you will be protected. Come on, get up, Son. Get up! You have a lot to do. You'll build here a chapel in honor of Lord of the Bonfim. Stop looking at yourself. You'll devote your life to help others. Easing pain, curing illnesses. But I can't do none of that! I'm only a poor wretch! One, two, three... four, five. Here will be born... the black... and mysterious... Church of the Red Water. In honor of Lord Jesus of the Bonfim... and all the saints. Amen. Founded on water... on rock... and on truth. Gigantic by nature Thou art a beautiful Strong, fearless colossus And thy future mirrors that greatness Adored land Among a thousand others Brazil is our beloved nation Thou art the gentle mother Of this soil's children, Brazil Hurrah! - Cirino! Cirino! - Jo?o! What a miracle to find you here! Today is the day of miracles, fella. Have you ever seen such an astonishing thing? All of a sudden, night turns into day. It happened so many times today that I couldn't even tell. So let 's drink, fella. Let 's celebrate. Sorry, but I don't drink anymore. I've come to see you I've come to get you Where are you? Come closer My God, you! Oh my God. - How did you find me here, boy? - The world is so small, ain't it? It 's small, but you are big, a grown man. This is what I've made for the church. Natalino, you make beautiful things. - Do you wanna make the altar saint? - What saint is that, Jo?o? It 's the Lord of the Bonfim. - What 's he like? - In my dream, he is free. On his left hand, he has the world and a cross. On his right hand, he has a golden ball. But he can use the ball to destroy the world. Whoever has faith in him will suffer nothing and will have a good ending. There's a stone missing, Son. The banto's stone is missing. You knew all the secrets of the world and earth. Today you don't know anything. My husband has died. I think I'm gonna die too. I have no place in this world. My son is sick... very sick. Calm down everybody. There's no more room left inside. We'll soon have to build a bigger church, because this one... - Very soon. - Is this the Chapel of the Red Water? Ms. Levinda! It looks like our friend has become famous. A mongrel dog. Who could tell! We've been companions in captivity and freedom. I got tired of carryin' him around drunk. Now he carries everybody. So I've heard. One man dies, and another one is born. Mr. Jo?o. Mr. Jo?o. I'm so sorry, but I have a problem. I need your help. I've searched for it all over, Mr. Jo?o. I can't find my parrot. Help me. It 's almost a family member. My son, don't worry. Your parrot is on a tree in your backyard. Mr. Jo?o? Mr. Jo?o? My friend! Mr. Jo?o! So it 's true! - You've become a saint! - What are you talking about? I've always had voices in my head. I've just learned to listen to them. They tell me the things I have to do. The church is beautiful! And you're lookin' tired. It 's because of Teodoro, fella. He put me in the bad life. I have to bear rudeness of dirty white men... and disgusting black men. I'm tired. It 's no longer fun, fella. We need a determined woman here to organize this mess. And is there a roof for me? If there ain't, we'll build one. Cirino, Natalino! Ah, my parrot. Thanks, my Saint Benedict, my Jo?o de Camargo! Come on, my pet. My dear pet. Officer, do you know where the Church of the Red Water is? Oh my God. This girl is burning hot. - What does she have? - She's been like that for days. I've heard of Mr. Jo?o de Camargo's miraculous cures. A voodoo man. Ignorant people magic. - You should go and see a doctor. - Alright, thank you. Hey, you! Are you looking for Mr. Jo?o? Go straight ahead and take the road by the river. Listen, keep the faith, he'll cure the girl. Thank you very much! Come. That 's right... there. Over here! Come, Edite! You move a bit to this side. That 's it. All the churches are graded ten. This one is graded fifteen. Mr. Jo?o, please... bless my daughter. She doesn't stop shivering. Mr. Jo?o, help us out of charity. I'm sorry, but it 's Monday, Souls' Day, and I can't help you. The saints do not speak today. Come back tomorrow, and we'll pray. Have faith. - We'll arrive there at night. - I'm tired. Are you very tired? Damned hen, I'll get you! Damned one! It 's no use running, I'll get you! Damn you! I got you, devilish hen! Up! Up! Up! You'll make it! It was a real miracle. Look how beautiful she is! Praised be Jo?o de Camargo! Calm down. Please calm down a bit. You're the band number five, that 's the number of the century. That was determined in the beginning, and it should always be so... and again be determined as number five. Amen. Amen. I didn't know you could write music. In fact I can't, Natalino, but it tells me things. - It? - The church. It says we should not suffer. The idols are made of clay... but I make questions and soon a voice tells me the answers. I hope they'll teach me how to play this thing. - You'll do. - I've come a long way. I don't want to disturb him, but I have to talk to him. Wait. Sorry for interrupting, but this woman won't calm down. - Speak up. - I've brought these to thank you. Look, he took your tea and he got well. I'll keep this white one, thank you. But that one already has an owner. Give it back to the evil one. Let 's go! Cheers to the Lord of the Bonfim! Cheers! To the Church of the Red Water! Cheers! Cheers! - Cheers to Brazil! - Cheers! - Cheers to the Lord of the Bonfim! - Cheers! - To the Church of the Red Water! - Cheers! - Cheers to all the saints! - Cheers! - To the Church of the Red Water! - Cheers! - Cheers to the Lord of the Bonfim! - Cheers! - Cheers to Rongondongo! - Cheers! - Cheers to all the saints! - Cheers! - Cheers to Saint Benedict! - Cheers! - Cheers to Monsignor Jo?o Soares! - Cheers! - Cheers to Oxal?! - Cheers! It 's gone too far! Too far! They've brought their profane songs to our windows, to our doors. That is an offense to the Christian feelings of our people. They perform blood sacrifices. Fanatics! Outlaws! The situation is delicate. Do not forget we are a republic. Jo?o de Camargo has become a respected man. Important people from the capital come to see him. Above all, we must abide by God. By God and the law. To the heretics, hell; to the outlaws, jail. They're not breaking any laws. It 's a religion. No, no. It 's not a religion at all. It 's black magic, witchcraft. They take our most sacred images... and desecrate our values. "The Black Pope". That is heresy! May the Lord of the Bonfim Rongondongo bless you all, amen. Amen. Jo?o, my life is disgraceful. My wife has run away. My crops are dried. The world is against me. What should I do? Mr. Jo?o, Mr. Jo?o! My son didn't get better. He's still feverish. Mr. Jo?o, my son is dying. I beg you a medicine to cure him. We have no more medicine for your son. He could be better now. You threw away the herbs I gave you, didn't believe me. And you threw away the faith too. It 's faith that cures. - Herbs help. - My son! My son is dying! Trace your steps back. Have faith and you'll find the herbs. Go with God and the Virgin Mary. - What do you want? - I have a request. - I seek help for my daughter. - What is your name again? - Rivair Soares. - Rivair Soares? He's promised me some bricks, but they haven't arrived yet. - My workers are waiting. - We have no money to pay you. - No, I work for the cause itself. - Really? Thank you, Mr. Rivair. - When can you start? - Now. You can come back here later with your request. The Lord of the Bonfim will help us with that cause, ok? Go in peace. Bye. - Open the door! - Police! Open! - Open the door! - Open up! Police! Open it now! - Open the door! - Police! Open up! Open the door! Open the door! Police! What 's going on here? Who do you think you are? What is that, boy? Shut up! What do you want? "It 's hereby forbidden in this district black magic... ...as are any displays of witchcraft." - "Witchcraft"? We don't practice voodoo here! Again. Mr. Jo?o! If you believe in what I believe, we'll be brethren. If you don't believe in it, we won't be anything. It starts from the little one and goes on to the bigger ones. I'm not God's friend. I'm only his humble servant where He's put me. I'm not a priest either. Each one has his own duties and nothing else. Let 's go to the station. You're under arrest! He's a little mad. He doesn't make sense. You'll pray in jail! Bastards, assholes, dumb asses! Aruanda. I'm going to Aruanda. Oxal? and Rongondongo guide you, Son. Hail Mary, full of grace. The Lord is with thee. Blessed art thou among women... and blessed is the fruit of thy womb, Jesus. - Stop it! - Holy Mary, mother of God... pray for us sinners now and at the hour of death. Stop it! This is a white man's prayer. Is that what you want? To become white? So I'll help you. Don't do that, brother. He's Jo?o de Camargo. The one from the Red Water? Why do you deny our African gods and the beliefs of our ancestors? You're black, had black parents, but keep praying to white saints? This is not Africa, Son. There's an ocean in between. To live here, you must be able to put everything together. Lies, it 's all lies! The slave house was closed, but we still have the jail. We're not slaves and we've never been. There are no slaves in the Kingdom of God. There are no chains that capture the soul. - And no riches that enlighten. - Go, go, go away! That Carlos Gomes is a fake. I prefer Puccini, Verdi, the masters. But why? "O Guarani" is a beautiful opera. Sung in Italian? Yes, but sung by an Indian, a Brazilian Indian. - In love with a white woman. - This is progress, novelty. Indians, as well as blacks, can have noble feelings too. One day all those races will make up a single Brazilian identity. Your Excellency is a dreamer. Have you heard of Allan Kardec, the Frenchman? He's white and claims incorporating spirits is something natural. You are the judge in this district, aren't you? A very zealous and law-abiding judge, Minister. Based on which laws do you keep Jo?o de Camargo in jail? These blacks want to turn religion into a wild celebration. Restrain yourself, Mr. Judge. Obey the order. - Outta here! - Release the man! Mr. Jo?o has to be more careful. Monsignor Jo?o Soares is my protector and guide. That 's what they don't like, when we use their saints. The saints belong to no one, Cirino. All I want is to fulfill my mission: Help people. This is the oil blessed by Mr. Jo?o. It brings health and blessings. Here. Buy Mr. Jo?o's oil. Owa, horse! One, two, three, four... fifteen. Fifteen are the grades of the Church of the Red Water. Calm down, calm down! Calm down! The speaker in this church is Jo?o de Camargo. In the name of Our Lord Jesus... we won't sell oil anymore! Our Lord does not trade! The house is holy, the medicine is free, and we do not sell it! Those are the orders, I have to follow them! Only the Savior! Mr. Jo?o now thinks he is Jesus Christ? I'm only His humble servant. I liked the scene. Beautiful. Jo?o expels the merchants from the temple! Just like Jesus. No. It 's all wrong. The oil shouldn't be sold. It does not cure by itself. Lots of people in need of help, lots of people taking advantage. Poor me! If I depended on you, I'd be starving. I've come here to know from a green leaf what the Holy Ghost is. On a rooster's crow It gave me the pleasure of knowledge. It won't belong to the living because they do not know. But lt'll belong to the dead who deserve. Open our ideas, ease our lives. Contemplate our pleasure. Helpoursteps and guide ourcharlty. Soul from the sky, flower from the fields. Leaves of grass, wind of enchantment. Voice from the mountain. Whlte and black cannot be separated. We've already won and happiness is inevltable. Are all the same: Life and death... wake and sleep, young and old. God is day and night, winter and summer, war and peace... plenty and starvation. I THANK FOR THE GRACE I'VE BEEN GIVEN Our Lady Aparecida... take my son out of the criminal life. I beg you: Allow me to live long enough to bring up my children. I ask to be happy in my marriage and get alongwlth my mother-in-law. Mr. Jo?o de Camargo, have my father buy the house as soon as possible. Please, help me forget that ungratefulwoman. Saint Good Jesus of the Bonfim, have my hair grow... and then I'll take a picture wlth my hair down... and I'll give It to you as a promise. My Lord Good Jesus, don't let the woman I love die. Jo?o de Camargo, may my father's head get better. Saint Terezinha, have my sister take overthe loom and earn better. I ask for health for my entire family... and a job for my unemployed son. Jo?o de Camargo, may I learn how to play the piano... and dance the tango gracefully. JO?O DE CAMARGO WAS ARRESTED 17 TIMES. IN 1921, HE ESTABLISHED THE "ASSOCIATION OF THE GOOD LORD... OF THE BONFIM OF THE RED WATER." HE DIED IN 1942, AT THE AGE OF 84. 5,OOO PEOPLE ATTENDED HIS FUNERAL. HE HAS BEEN WORSHIPPED EVER SINCE. A MOVIE DEDICATED IN MEMORY TO:
