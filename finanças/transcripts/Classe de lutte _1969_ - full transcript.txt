Cinema is not a magic. It is a technic and a science. A technic born from a science and set to a will. Will that have the workers to release themselves. SOLIDARITY WITH SPANISH HELP VIETNAM What are you doing? I militate! SLON PRESENTS A FILM BY MEDVEDKINE GROUP CLASS OF STRUGGLE To militate is... What she wants now is really to be politically active. And I think I'm preventing her. I'm not stopping her... I'm almost forced to stop her, because life would be hell afterwards. You see? It would be worse than how we live now. We do go to some meetings together but there are times when she can't come. Well, you see, then I don't see how we can ever get together on this thing. Still, I'd like to be a militant, and all. I realise that even so I don't have the time I'm really liable to do a bad job. I try a bit here and there but... Yes, you've tried and then you saw the result a week later, your foreman sent you a note... Yes, but then... Yes, OK but you see that, to militate alone. Yes, but from the time you... you're a militant, you fight alone, you must bring in others, that's what's being a militant is about. But that doesn't solve your problems. Don't you think that you as a militant want to achieve your aims? Yes! You don't have much chance of succeeding. Oh yes, I hope to achieve something but not only for me, something to benefit others, you see? You think that this would be how to get overcome. I think that we'll make it, yes we will... it will be hard. Very hard. Because you're frightened! Why are you frightened? No, but listen, no one's frightened. We can't accept being divided. Until now we decided to go on strike together we've set out our claims together, we want to see Management together and we'll continue to fight together. If we've got to vote, we'll do it together... We must absolutely stick together... Victory in our struggle today depends not only on unity of the workers but also on the support of all our people, in their majority for our programme of democratic and socialist reconstruction. Minorities do not make history. People do. The Superior Factory. Leather goods. The boss said: "The secret behind my success is that I address my workers "TU". Well really, nothing is ever done for want of volunteers, first and then. Well but your first idea was, when you wanted to start this action and when you put down your tools, it was... To start a union. To start a union and get information from local trades councils. That was already started, it was. Yes, the outbreak of the strike really helped us start and then it really grew. Now we have 80 people signed up, but if we had not had the strike... Regional capital, Besancon is one of the best protected cities in France. A Gaullist deputy, a socialist council. It is a city in just the right place. To the right of France but to the left of Switzerland. Its population has doubled in 30 years: 65.000 just before the War 130.000 they say today. Birth rate, immigration, rural exodus, concentration. Nothing new. Besancon city of the Franche-Comte, a city like any other, you get bored on Sundays, during the week, you work. Textiles, engineering, construction, but Besancon's industry is dominated by watchmaking. Lip. It's time! Lip guarantees you exact time. At the third top exactly 1 p.m. At the third top 1 p.m. Lip, it's time! Besancon manufactures a third of French watches in 40 factories employing about 4 000 workers. A glossy pamphlet published in 1964 by the council and paid for by the bankers says with humour: "Women comprise 32% of the active labour force, and bring many households a welcome supplement". Translation without humour: "Precision work requires a skilled and humble work force, watchmakers need little hands." But little hands are increasingly carrying big banners. This astonishing pamphlet also states: "The social climate is relatively calm. Trade unions only account for a few workers and their audience often depends on the devotedness of a few leaders than on ideological choice." In three lines the Besancon working class is executed. We will illustrate this with three images. STRIKE No, I didn't return my jacket he said, I changed the size, to be more comfortable, I took the next bigger size. Yes, despite a long heritage, the working class movement is alive and well in Besancon, capital of watchmaking. Yema Total 217 Men 97 Women 120 Average age 30 Capital 3 million Francs Turnover 16,5 million F. Trade union influence before May 68 till today... Once when we came back from the factory, when we took up our normal work again, we had to explain that we must organise, that we had to elect temporary shop stewards, that we had to set up an organisation, and that's preparing for struggle, you see, that's the normal job for the militant. That's how our local guerilleros fight in the French factories "maquis". The union can only live through its members, with their subs, and that gives us the means to print leaflets and keep the trade union going, you see. How many members are there in your factory... in the CGT? At the moment we're thirty. There were more during the strike, we were 45. You see a continuous starting over again, there are always highs and lows, there are stewards, it's official, of course but you see, it's really something new and people who didn't know what a union was now know just what the role of the steward is. When you explain things, do you feel they understand? I feel they understand but I also feel they don't want to, you could say they're scared to understand... people believe that they can do things by themselves, you see, it's a kind of individualism. But it's not the only obstacle. Since May, the boss is trying everything to win people back to him. Poison. We had a real mess, the boss tried of course to make up his own list of stewards and we had to fight against those people, to explain that if they didn't want to belong to a union. They weren't independent like they claimed to be, but tried to do something. The direct counterattack. Once there's a union, bam! They sack! The weaker the opponent the stronger he strikes thus showing the nature of the class struggle. They did away with jobs or things like that, they downgraded and they didn't downgrade just anyone, you see... Because the boss knew? You know what it's like in small factories it's easy to see you see people who talk things over with militants or who sell subs, they sell them in the corridors, in the toilet, that's known it's discussed... Since May 68 the bosses are on the defensive. Back to the wall. Today, at Yema as elsewhere, the battle of ideas is going on. Buying the newspaper is an act of consciousness, small, you see, but already something. You know about problems concerning everyday life. You can guide the conversation to trade union matters or to a higher level, politics, you see. To keep in contact with the masses, you must explain to people in what conditions they live and from the moment they understand, they'll accept the struggle. And at that moment, there will be a change, because everyone will want a change and it will start then, you see. We need a push from the masses. Three blokes can't make a revolution, that's all. We the French Communist Party say that the United Left Programme is a serious arrangement, a real agreement made before the whole country as witness of its respect and application that says how, with what and in what time the Left will be able to satisfy basic needs... At 2h PM they locked the gate so that the personnel couldn't get back in. There was no reason for it. If the boss wanted to say something, he had to do as we did, he should have to get on the wall. The Management announced a secret ballot yesterday. We can't accept it. The bosses and the government are not the ones who ask workers to go on strike, and neither do they, today, have the right to tell us how to continue our struggle to achieve our goals. Tell me a little about when you spoke for the first time... you must remember it... The first time I spoke was... ...it was because, when I saw that the discussion was not too good, and people were not really involved, I went home, and I tried to make a little thing for the next morning, then I got to work, and I showed it to the CGT militants who were there, who were leafleting. I showed them what I wanted to say... and if that was it, well if it was good. Then they said yes and I could do it. Well, I got up on the wall and I spoke to the blokes in the factory ...I told them I was speaking in the name of the CGT, it's the first time I've ever used a label, you see. If we're here, you and I, everyone ought to know, it's because we are first and foremost without hate for anyone, we don't want to take anything away from anyone. What we want is for the workers to have a bit more than they have and we say so not necessarily more money but more consideration and more dignity. I wanted to say why, in the name of the CFDT, we ask you to continue the strike. Well, the blokes from the Strike Committee, they felt that they should join a trade union. And we tried to sign them up, well, me and the others, they had to take a stand, and, they had to decide... What is Social Security? We feel that everyone rich and poor, has the right to free treatment because health, it's not something we deserve, it's something that hits us, better for us to have it and bad luck if we don't. Should those who are in bad health have to support on their salary all the costs? There's something, ...you see, I don't know if his arguments got through, there's something, he spoke a long time and he spoke well, he used beautiful words people are used to listening, well, I don't know, on the telly, people who speak well... you get the feeling that because they speak well, even if its vacuous, even if it's pure shit, you swallow it all you see... Well, why when you wrote the paragraph "together" we felt that it stood out, where did it come from? Well, as soon as I said "together", you know, because I felt it, moreover this story of solidarity, I wished we could remain together so I said it as strongly as I could. Do you think if the comrades from Lip had not come? Well, to Yema, we wouldn't have started, in any case not that day? No, not that day, there was absolutely nothing and no discussions, there was no trade union in the factory, you see, there was nothing, and no one talked about one. Well, from then on, we went into the courtyard and then we asked for volunteers to go talk to the boss, and we wrote down some demands on paper. The boss saw us, sure, he said: "Good Lord, come back tomorrow and I'll give you my answer." Well, we went back to the other workers and then we gave them his answer. Then, there were those who were on the Strike Committee who said to everyone: "Well, now we have been able to talk to the boss, we ought to come back tomorrow, that's all, you can go home now." Well I, I tried to get things going again, you see, because a strike, it's not done for pleasure, it's not a holiday. I explained to everyone that they were involved, and that we had to talk things over, and we didn't know each other, well, there were lots of problems but that we had to talk about them and to set up a Strike Committee really, you see? I wanted to draw attention to the fact that the Management was hiding behind government directives. But the government never took any decisions about basic wage claims. That means that, if today, you agree to return to work, if you agree to do it, you would have agreed to striking for 10 days and got nothing for it. He shouldn't say, "I give you this and that" without going through the shop stewards. All the shop stewards from all the factories would tell you and local unions would tell you, that it shouldn't work that way. The boss doesn't order a strike. We do. Today the Management asked to speak without having discussed with our stewards. Here we have proof that the Management doesn't want to recognise the trade union in its factory. You'll see what would happen to trade union rights at Yema if we don't force them to respect us. Let me speak... In the name of freedom, please. Well... go on. Listen! M. Blum was not exactly straightforward. He hasn't given complete satisfaction, I agree, but he's ready to do so, I'm sure of it! So, the Yema workers and employees have got to realise, that we're not faced with a trade union problem but a governmental! Not at all! No! It is not true at all! Quiet, please! I ask Yema employees to come and express themselves freely and immediately. Without external constraint because the workers are being pressurised now. I'd like to ask you, if you're not being pressurised to speak too? Not at all. We never saw this gentlemen until eight days ago. Comrades! You certainly know that we have stated that all bonuses would be paid out in proportion to our profits and would be given at the usual time. They would never be withheld for any reason, your wages or the supplements due. Now, those who wish I repeat since we have finished that those who belong to the company and who wish to understand its problems, I cannot enter into a general discussion when its elements are not in our control but dealt with in Paris by the present or future government, I ask you to come into the factory. If, on the other hand some do not want to, I am sorry because those are your problems and in any case we must not engage in politics. We trust you comrades. I can tell to people who are far away and have not heard that the bonuses will be distributed at the normal time. There's a notice on every door. No, but... then don't forget that the Management doesn't give presents because every company gives a bonus and good God it's money you've earned So it's natural that you have it. Damned right. Moreover, if the bosses want to talk democracy, I must point out that the majority of the workers voted for a return to work, so normally they would go back. Unfortunately the boss locked them out, so where is your democracy? He wanted neither trade union nor politics, he wanted certainly a contract with the workers but without a label, you see, so, he wanted something that he could run himself, he wanted to divide us, you see, to divide the two groups. So that there was solidarity between the workers and if for a moment we thought they would leave us in the lurch, they didn't. And then the boss was left alone by himself in the courtyard, and none of the workers followed him. And the return to work and Yema. Tell me what happened? Well, it was a bit, a bit scrappy, our mates understood that they had nothing, but some were ready to continue, then others, they were bothered by money problems, so, they went back to work. They went back in small groups and the Management, the bosses, well all the managers were waiting at the gates and took the workers by the arm encouraging them to return. They went mostly after young workers and said: "If your father was here what would he think?" As if parents send their kids, you see! Are your relations with the Management different from what they were before May? Yes, it's totally different because before May, I was an ordinary employee like all the others so... 10th February 1965 Madame, we are pleased to confirm the conditions of your employment in our concern: Multicopier K160. Monthly salary based on 40 hours per week: 600 F. We are extremely pleased to have you in our company are certain that you will make every effort to apply yourself assiduously to your new post. Yours faithfully, Madame... 26 October 1966 Madame, we are pleased to inform you that you will receive, from November the 1st a basic salary of 750 F per month. We are extremely pleased to confirm our satisfaction in your work. Yours faithfully, Madame... 30 January 1967 Madame, your monthly salary will be increased from the 1st February 1967 to 800 F per month. January 1967 We take this occasion to remind you that exceptional bonuses and supplements are not part of a basic salary but are a sign of regard for the devoted work given by our employees. We are extremely pleased to sweeten your Christmas this year and wish you a Merry Christmas and a prosperous New Year. Well, after the strike, did things happen at Yema? that would not have occurred the previous year? Yes, of course, after the holidays, for example, sanctions were taken against women who came back late, you see. Usually... It already happened last year when women came back two or three days later than the end of the holidays nothing or almost nothing was said to them, just a warning or something like that. But this year, well they fired people. And then, well, it was hard you see, because they went for trade union members and well, there was a bit of a panic. In other words the boss tried to smash the trade unions. Sure, that's what he tried to do. And what did he try to do to you? Well, after the holidays I was downgraded, because they did away with my job, and they took advantage of that, well, to downgrade me and they even tried to lay me off, but the work Inspector refused to accept that. Well, they were forced to find a job for me in the factory. But, a really downgrading job. And I lost a big chunk of my wages. Why did they try to downgrade you? Well, the reason? I mean, the one the boss used, it was a reevaluation of my work, but in fact, they didn't admit what I'd done in May and that we have exploited it. Because from the day before the strike, you see? I already talked a little bit about trade unions. You see, I allowed myself to be seen a bit. Well, I had some letters warning me, my work had really become disgusting, I was no longer working well, and as soon as I said a bit about what was going on you see... 1. You must refrain from political discussion during working hours. 2. Your duties as a provisionary shop steward must not be exercised out of the official time of 15h per month officially allowed for. 3. You have been observed reading magazines and documents having no relation to your work. 4. We require punctuality. 5. We must remind you that it is forbidden to collect trade union dues during working hours. Please consider this letter as a final warning. Yours faithfully. 1st October 1968 Madame, we hereby confirm that the conditions of your transfer to export services DME Post: Junior typist Grade 123 Monthly salary per 40 hours a week: 549 F We wish to inform you that your new post implies a knowledge of shorthand. Yours sincerely, European Department, Managers' Office. For two months, they gave me really nasty jobs, you see, I was in packing, in sorting, well, now it's not too bad, aside from the money, it's not too bad. About the money... how much have you lost? I'm losing, well about 250 F a month. 250 a month? And how much do you earn? Well, 550 per month... net. How are things with your boss now? My boss, you know, he is... Well, he's a bit different, but he's like any other boss, well... He's got his own style, but the struggle is the same against any boss, you see. I've become more self-confident, you see? I talk to him on an equal footing, he doesn't frighten me. And it's funny because when we meet in the corridor he says hello and he's the one who lowers his eyes, you see. In the film "Be seeing you" you said something that struck me. You said, "We work in a vacuum!" In a sense, we work in a vacuum because only the boss profits from what we do. He's the only one who puts the profits in his pocket only. In another way, I don't work in a vacuum anymore because... A militant's job, you see, we feel we're giving something to people and... We help them understand things, and in that way, you see, I don't work in a vacuum anymore. How did you make up for the 30.000 old Franc shortfall on your wages? Well, I made it up through contact with the women, you see, the congenial ambiance with them for example, well, I didn't have contacts before, we hardly ever talked. Well now, we meet in the corridor and we shake hands. You see, it's a completely different atmosphere since May. Just for that alone it's worth losing 30.000 Old Francs. Yes, I think so! That's the point. In life, money, well, you need it but it's not everything. Aren't there moments when you're discouraged, sometimes? Have you ever thought of leaving this factory, to go somewhere to try to get back your wage? Yes, it happened once, you see, I saw something in the paper, it would have interested me and I said to myself "Try!" I felt... I've already told you about it... and I did write to that place and when I got home, I thought, "What have you done? You've started something, you've told your mates that they've got to join the union, that they shouldn't be frightened." And then, well, if I left, you see, I would have felt I betrayed them, they have a battle to fight... I feel related to them and want to continue with them. Did your boss ever tell you off for being political? Yes, once, in a meeting, he said, that he couldn't increase wages, he had to be competitive in the Common Market. He said that the workers would have to raise their productivity and that they must keep the same level of wages. Well, I said, "You said that everyone must make an effort, but you assign a double effort to the workers but your profit margin, it doesn't change." And he said to me: "But Madame, that is class struggle, you are being political!" Do you feel you're part of a struggle, class against class, you are true opponents and... Once he even tried being paternalistic. Not so long ago, coming back from a meeting he said to me: "You know we don't want to fight, I've nothing against anyone... not even against Madame Zedet!" and he took me by the shoulder, you see and tried to soften us up, to reduce the struggle, you see, and make us believe that... he was still the boss and thought of us as friends really is not true. The struggle is there and our blokes must continue to fight. Tell me about Picasso. Picasso, is... is... you see... he's a bit Prevert... I don't know, you maybe remember once in a Prevert's poem a young invalid... in a public garden... and then... Picasso's "Magic Lantern". Yes, that's it. And then, a pomegranate on the table, you see, from there on, you understand things. Well, I understood some things. What? Because you see, artists, poets, they've got something to say too, things to express. And then in our society, in which we live today, you see I don't know, conditions are such that workers believe that poetry and painting or things like that, it's not for them, you see, they think it's reserved for the bourgeoisie or a certain kind of people. And you too believed so for a long time. Oh, of course, I thought like that and... At the same time, you see, I discovered the workers' struggle, I realised that culture is something and gives us things, and in the end I don't see why we don't go to exhibitions and why we don't read poems and things like that. It's very important. The CGT union is fighting today for its cultural demands. I don't know, libraries or exhibitions in factories all that... it's very important, as important as is the rise of wages. And you, personally, you think that an Eluard's poem is as important as a Seguy's speech? Yes, I think it is. Well, also one book that I read recently and that really marked me was "Beau masque" by Vailland. Reading it, you begin to understand so many things, you see. And also, it could provide workers with self-confidence and take off their fear of the boss... It's really important. For example which book would you make your friend read? The book you read and that seems to you... I, I read... the first book I read and that... Well, that I liked a lot was "The Mother" by Gorki. The boss wants the floor, in the name of freedom. The boss doesn't control the strike, we do. Let him get up on the wall like everyone else. In the name of democracy, he disregarded our representatives. This shows he ignores our unions. He's got no right to do that, he can't do it. In the name of democracy! When there are lay-offs there's no secret ballot to ask what people think. In the name of democracy. They are tired now, let's give them some relief money. We shall see who thinks about his wallet more than his ideas. That's how they're trying to fool us. In the name of democracy. We suggest a 10% rise of the sliding wage scale. We won't be cheated. We'll fight as long as necessary. In the name of freedom. Comrades, we can't accept to be divided. Until now we decided to strike TOGETHER We've voiced our claims TOGETHER We've talked to the Management TOGETHER We must keep on fighting TOGETHER to be continued
