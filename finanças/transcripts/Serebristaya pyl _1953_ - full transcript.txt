SILVER DUST Sir. I've called for you, General Mac Kennedy, to entrust you with an important, highly classified mission. Thank you for your trust in me, sir. Here, in the South, is the small town of Fortskill. In this town, research is taking place which is of great interest to us. You're referring to Samuel Steele, and his radioactive nuclear laboratory. Precisely, General. By the way, you're somewhat familiar with Professor Steele... We're old friends, sir. Went to school together, and later both taught chemistry at Columbia University. Steele was an assistant to O'Connor, and when the old man suddenly passed away, Steele married his widow, and... And as dowry, got himself a first-class laboratory. That Steele has always been exceptionally lucky. Let's get down to business. Professor Steele has long kept us in the dark regarding his invention. But now, Steele's financial backer, the Southern Chemical Trust, has decided, that it's time to show their cards and reveal everything to us! Tomorrow you will go to Fortskill, and get yourself acquainted with the experiments. Who will be going with me? Upton Bruce himself! The president of the Trust. - Hmm... - I believe Bruce is your backer as well. I know Mr. Bruce well, and owe him a lot, but... Go on, General. We're both no-nonsense people, sir, so I will speak frankly. Mr. McWood, the president of the Western Chemical Trust, is a relative of my wife's. - Hmm! And he entrusted me with making you an offer regarding Steele's invention. How can McWood be aware of Steele's top secret experiments? Those Wall Street types have their finger in every pie. It never ceases to amaze me. What message did McWood ask you to deliver? Here's the thing... If Steele, for any reason whatsoever, decides to sell his invention not to the Southern Trust, but to the Western one. Will McWood be able to count on your support? Impossible! Bruce was the one who financed Steele's research! Too bad, sir! McWood is willing to pay up to 2% of his net profit. If he's the one who will get the order. Actually, the big bosses don't care one bit which financial institution gets the order. Exactly! They don't care at all, sir. But me and you, we care quite a bit. Millions of dollars are on the line. Bruce is going to raise a huge stink. McWood is worth more to us than Bruce. In any case, tomorrow you'll be going to Fortskill with Bruce, and Heaven help you if Bruce suspects anything. I'll keep that in mind, sir... Hello, Mrs. Mary! How have you been? What's that? It's a petition. You should congratulate me, Mama. In just a week, I collected 500 signatures. You shouldn't be doing that, Ben. I'm worried. A smart Negro, who would like to keep on living in this world, shouldn't be irritating either the white master or his white God. Don't worry, Mama. The world is different now. Not for us. For us, nothing has changed in the world. I'm scared of this German, with the white eyebrows. Of course Mr. Schneider is a stupid man, very stupid. But why should we be scared of him? You should come to the Peace meeting today, and see Negroes standing with white people. Not so loud, someone might hear and think that you got involved with communists. So what if they do! Go on, Ben. The mistress doesn't like it when you go inside the house. And be careful! Mary... Mary! Coming, ma'am. - Still fiddling around? - Everything is in order. The rooms are ready. Who's been here? - My son, ma'am. - Ben? Is that so? Haven't I told you already that I don't like him visiting. You have, ma'am. But Ben has only been here for a few minutes. It makes no difference how much time he spent here. Take it away. Careful! Yes, ma'am. Finally! My darling... - Hello there, Mr. O'Connell! - Jack! Hello! - What's happening here? - There's going to be a meeting. I see that a lot has happened since I last saw you. Chicago is over and done with. - They fired you? More like threw me out. It seems that the honesty of my Americanism is fading. Well said. Coming! What are your plans? To see America. Especially veterans! - Glad to see you. Come by this evening! - Definitely! Hey! Sheriff Smiles! What's going on here at Fortskill? Nothing special, Mr. Bruce. Just those Reds of ours decided to organize a meeting. - Be on the lookout, Smiles. - We won't stand for any disorder. - Hello, Kennedy! - Here's our Steele's little shack. Mr. Bruce, finally! We were expecting you for breakfast. Business, Mrs. Steele. - Kennedy. - I remember you. - Sam! Come quickly! - Sam, old man... Ah, Professor... Well, gentlemen. I'm placing you in more reliable hands. Well, Mr. Steele, what good news do you have for us? Pardon me, Mr. Bruce. This pipe, sir, is the work of the English master [...]. An addition to your sensational collection. Thank you, General. Beautiful... A beautiful specimen. Would you like to freshen up, or should we get down to business? To business! How about you, Kennedy? I can't hardly wait to acquaint myself with your work. I've made everything ready for you, gentlemen. There, General. This is the devil's kitchen. Yes, this must've cost a lot of money. It's been using up more energy than this entire town with all its factories. Please put on protective clothing. In the old days, we made do without all this nonsense. It's perfectly safe, but we still take the smallest precautions. Ah! Indicators. In the presence of harmful radiation, the indicators light up. When the indicator lights up, all living things must [...]. Hey there, sweetheart. How's life been treating you? These are my closest co-workers. Dr. Schneider, our physician. Dr. Jones, our senior physicist. Dr. Schneider, take Charlie into the chamber. I'd like to show... The German knows which side his bread is buttered on. Dr. Schneider is a talented specialist. They almost hanged him during the Nuremberg trials. It would've been a shame. After me, please, gentlemen. - This is the headquarters. - Yes. This is where Steele conducts his experiments by himself. And not letting anyone else even take a peek. Yes, university labs aren't always as dependable as they should be. Well, let us see what it is that you've got to offer us. Please. This tube contains a substance that we're tentatively calling "Silver Dust". The substance isn't dangerous. As you can see, the indicators are not lighting up. As you can see, I'm holding it in my hands. If we subject it to a specific kind of processing, it will turn into an element possessing colossal radioactive powers. One milligram of it is enough to kill every living being in an area of 10,000 square meters. Not bad... The most important part: in a matter of a few days the radioactive matter completely disintegrates. And the area can again be occupied without any danger to living organisms. No disinfection is necessary. The Silver Dust disappears all by itself. Leaving absolutely no trace. Which means no protests. No international commissions. No speeches at the UN Assembly. All that's left is to demonstrate the effectiveness of this dust. That's exactly what I've invited you both here for. Dr. Schneider, are you ready? - Ready, sir. - Dr. Jones? - Yes, sir? We're subjecting the Dust to radiation. I'm receiving the substance and subjecting it to radiation. Usually we prepare activated material in advance. But today I'd like you to witness the entire process. Kennedy, he does it all by himself. Doesn't trust anyone else. And now our generator will begin processing the Silver Dust. Fully automated. If you only knew, General, how much this has cost me. I'm so sick and tired of your constant complaints about money. Aha! The substance is in place. If we would now open the door, a deadly burst of radiation would emerge. All indicators would light up. And the lucky heirs to Mr. Bruce's fortune would be very grateful to me. What do you say? Let's try it? Careful! Careful... Always joking... The monkey is in the chamber, sir. Get ready. Sir, can I go up there, closer to the chamber? Just pull the curtain. - Would you like to join me? - No, I wouldn't. - Why not? I don't enjoy watching the suffering of poor animals. Loading the Silver Dust into the chamber. Aha! The indicator has lit up. Bruce, I again suggest that you take a look. No? Too bad... - But doesn't your damned radiation penetrate glass? - Of course it does. Kennedy! The chamber is padded with a substance that seals it off. I think it's over. Magnificent! The monkey's corpse is radioactive. Touching it is no longer safe. While entering the chamber, Dr. Schneider needs to wear safety gear. Mr. Steele! Get me out of here! My nerves can't take this. Nothing more to be done here. Let's go back to my house. I'm a doctor. My business is curing people, not to give speeches. But when cannons are firing, when peaceful cities are burning, and when blood is spilled, I must say... You better keep your mouth shut! You won't stop this peace movement! We won't deny the truth, all that is honest and wholesome. You won't force us to stay silent. Let everyone hear what real, honest Americans have on their mind. It is only with our words... It is only with our words, not with our deeds that we take pride in Washington, Lincoln, and Roosevelt. We keep talking about our old, glorious democracy. But what we do is the exact opposite of what we say. Gentlemen, I must speak... What is this? Let that be a lesson to you! Remember the name Flossie! Harry, the old man is here! That means the fun should be starting any minute now! Leave them alone! These are decent people! Why are you bothering them? Leave me alone! I won't go! Get away, damn you! Leave me alone! You have no right! - Hello, Jen! - Allan! - Hello, sister! - I'm so glad! If you only knew how happy I am. How come you haven't written in so long? There haven't been any good news to write about. Have you been having problems? Did anything happen? Nothing really. But I've had to leave Chicago. - Do you want to move back home? - No. Maybe for a few days, until I find myself a job. How's mom? Like she's always been. Just like a year ago. You haven't been home in a year, you know. - Do I seem different? - Very different. You became so big. And so beautiful. And you're becoming more and more like our late father. Yes, people having been telling me that. - Master Allan! - Mary! - Master Allan! - Hello, Mary! - I'm so glad, Master Allan. - How's that Ben of yours? Good. He graduated school, as an honor student. - I'm so glad. - He wants to be a doctor! I wish him all the best. Mary! Mary! These Negroes will be the death of me. Wasting time on idle chitchat. - Yes, ma'am. - Take him for a walk. - Mom, Allan is here. - Hello, Mom! Allan! Are you staying long? A few days. Picking up some of my stuff. My son... Hello, my dear. Finally! I was afraid my husband was starving you to death in his boring lab. Please, gentlemen. - Sam! - Hello, Allan. - How have you been? - I came for a visit. You haven't met my oldest son, Allan. Ah! Glad to meet you, my young friend. I've heard so many good things about you from your mother. My mother has probably been embellishing my accomplishments. What a pleasure it is to see a happy American family. You need to take care of yourself, Sam. For your family. A man who works for the benefit of America shouldn't spare himself. My friends, as the Roman patricians used to say, "where it is good, that is where your homeland is". And our children and grandchildren will probably say, "where the earth is, that is where America is". And that would sound pretty good. But don't you think, General, that when this comes true, the earth would become a very boring place. - Jen... - A boring place? Why would it be boring, Miss O'Connell? What's wrong with it, Jen? In the whole world, there is only the USA. Wherever you go, everywhere is the USA. Just like here. You go to Europe, there's the USA. You go to Asia, also the USA. It's just lovely. You're right. You're so right, Mrs. Steele. It takes so damn little effort to put things in order. It only takes about 50,000 airplanes with atomic bombs. [...], Mr. Steele, eh? And for a real knockout, take every small town and send in a good-sized detachment of American policemen. And two electric chairs! Yes, but we still don't know, Mr. Bruce, how this mighty knockout of yours will turn out. Mr. O'Connell is right. There is always an element of risk in these matters. But there is a saying, "where there is no risk, there is no life". But what is life, really? To live is, first of all, to fight. A merciless fight for survival. And the one who survives, is the one who is the bravest, the strongest, and the most well adapted. Us Americans call this, "the law of the jungle". And it's all been proven long ago, as early as Charles Darwin. Isn't that so, my dear former student? Forgive me, my dear former professor. But Darwin has never proven this. The ones who have been proving this are you, and your financial backers. In my home, my stepson has always been considered [...]. Fortunately, this inclination disappears with age. - Hello, Allan! - Harry! - I finally get to see you! Hi, Mr. Bruce. How have you been? - Hi. Ah, General Mac Kennedy, if I'm not mistaken. Mom. What are you drinking? Mom, we just caught ourself a Negro. Oh dear... What Negro is that? It's actually a funny thing. - Yes? Sheriff let one darkie get away. We've been helping to catch him. We finally caught him, but just barely. And you know who this Negro turned out to be? - Yes? The son of our very own maid. - Ben? - Yes, Ben. Ben... But what are you saying? Where is he now? Unfortunately, I'll have to upset you, Mary. When I was getting into my Ford, Ben was also getting into a car. The difference was that I was doing it willingly, while he was being forcibly dragged away by 3 policemen! - Mary. - Master Allan! They'll kill him! They'll kill my boy! Help us, Master Allan! I promise you, Mary, I'll do everything I can. Thank you... I can't even look Mary in the eye. I swear, sometimes I'm simply ashamed of being white. It's not a matter of color of skin, sis. Let's go to the old garden. Let's go to our old tree, where we used to play Indians. I'll race you! Harry, Harry. I had to force myself not to hit that bastard. Harry has fallen in with the wrong crowd. The thing is that Dr. Schneider has been a bad influence on him. It's that German chemist that's been living in our house. You can't go any farther. - What's that? - It's security. Don't pay any attention. Go back, Miss! Go to hell! - Well said, young lady! - Let's go. Jen, it's just a man doing his job. Let's get out of here. Yes, that stepfather of ours has certainly been inventing some pretty strange mousetraps. Hello, Mr. O'Connell! Dick Jones! Why am I not allowed to go wherever I please? No big deal. Just your father expanding the lab at the expense of the garden. - And you love it! - And I really do love it! Imagine that! Wipe that grin off your face! - Everything's been going so well, Jen. - Not that I've noticed. Kids, I see that you're quarreling. You'll have more fun doing that without me. - Allan! I need to go into the city. I've got important business there. I'll see you. Jen... The boss presented his material to the General and Mr. Bruce. That means that the invention is a go. They're going to set up a really big conglomerate. They'll name me as head physicist of this conglomerate. And you'll be the wife of the head physicist. - How does that scenario appeal to you? - What are you going to manufacture there? You see, I'm can't talk to anyone about that. Not even with you. In fact, except for my own gadgets I don't even know anything. They pay me well. That's absolutely enough for me. It's not enough for me, Dick. I don't want to be the wife of a man who doesn't know what it is he's being paid to do. Well, what can I do... I don't even know myself. My old man used to say, "don't put off till tomorrow what you can do today". Well, Kennedy? How did you like Steele's experiment? As long as it's done on monkeys, the experiment is satisfactory. But us military men, we're of course interested in humans, not monkeys. What's the difference? Nerves, muscles, all kinds of kidneys and stuff, they all exist both in monkeys and in people. It isn't that simple, Mr. Bruce. The susceptibility of different animals to radiation, is different. Even more so, when we deal with humans. I can't stage the necessary tests. On this planet, thank God, there's quite a few places where one can experiment with new types of weapons. Our biologists are having great success experimenting on POWs. I'm well aware of that. But not one grain of Silver Dust will be leaving the confines of my lab. Not until I'm done with my experiments. - And not until my contract is finalized. - We're willing to risk it. We're ready to start production based on current data. I must've told you 20 times - to finish experimenting, I need real subjects to experiment on. Goddamnit! In his own field of research, you're giving priority to that Stan Hardy, that bastard. You're letting him grow some kind of idiotic imbeciles in their own natural environment. While we waste our time experimenting on some kind of rodents. Why is that? You're a businessman, you tell me. Why are you pouting like a little boy? We also told you 20 times, that if you need money, we'll give you money. But regarding your other demands, we're powerless. You're not powerless at all. Why, look at the general. Before the war, he didn't even own a proper suit. And now he's one of your largest shareholders. You even stuck a general's uniform on him. Sam... You're so horribly rude and insulting. Fine, let's say I agree to your terms, if the ordering party agrees as well. What do you say, Kennedy? As representative of the ordering party, I insist on controlled experiments. You're stalling, Kennedy. I don't like it. So instead of monkeys, get me a group of Koreans or Chinese. - Enough to fill at least one transport plane. - How will we get them here? A damn delicate undertaking, Sam. We're getting enough flack already about the execution of the POWs on Kujido island. You called for scientists, and here we are. I'll give you an instrument to help you become the masters of the entire planet. - So please, kindly help me. - No, no, Sam. No one weapon can win the war. Those people will soon find an answer to your Silver Dust. And while they're doing that, we can be making a lot of money. About getting you some human material, I'm not against that. But on the other hand, that will prolong the process. The experiments will be done in my lab. Fine. Enough. There's still time. I'll try to get you those required experiments, without having to wait for Kennedy. Where's your phone? If you find it inconvenient to phone from here, you can use my room. Fantastic. I'll show you how one works with big businessmen. General... That Bruce is so full of himself. Can't expect a good upbringing from a modern entrepreneur. Yes, yes. Bruce doesn't have an ounce of innate refinement. I'm glad he's gone, because I need to have a friendly conversation with you. - What's the matter, Mac? - How tight are you with Bruce? They've been financing me. I know that. And what if a different company would... The Eastern Trust, for example? What if you were offered a more substantial sum? It has to be a very substantial sum. It has to be worth my while. Name a price. You're insane! That's a colossal amount of money! I completely forgot about one tiny matter. I own a small amount of Southern Trust stock. So if I end up doing business with another company, my family has to take a loss on dividends. That needs to be taken into account as well. Business is business, Sam. Let's forget we ever had this conversation. Hello. Hello! I need to speak to the governor. I know! And I know that he's taking a rest! Ah! Good evening, Mr. Bruce. I thank you, Mr. Bruce. My health? Fantastic. My wife and daughter? They've been well too. Some pointy-headed scientist has a need for... in the name of science... very important... humanity will be forever in your debt... we need some... But why not, Mr. Bruce, ask the military for some POWs? Koreans or Chinese? Ah... Takes too long... Yes... You're probably right. What? Negroes on death row? We don't have any of those in stock right now. If we get some, then I would of course send them your way. I'm counting on you, Governor. It is our duty is to support scientific research, Mr. Bruce. Goddamnit... Not a moment's rest. Have to do everything myself! Hello... Hello... Get me New York. GR-96465, Mr. McWood. Yes, yes, yes. Mac Kennedy. General Mac Kennedy. Mr. McWood is expecting my call. Yes? Huh? Is that you, Mac? Huh? Speak louder, goddamn you. Yes, I'm listening. Of course. I'm listening. Yes... Huh? Say that again, I can't hear you. Mr. McWood, Steele's invention is simply amazing. It's money in the bank. I managed to stall a bit. But Bruce is in a rush to finalize the agreement. The thing is, that Steele's terms are unacceptable. Steele will agree to sign with us only if we pay him... 40%! You're an idiot! You're a moron! I don't want to hear it! Do something! Fix it, by any means! By any means, I tell you! In case of success, you'll be getting a $50,000 bonus! You, personally! [...] the patents of the Southern Trust! Mr. McWood... Mr. McWood... Listen to me, and remember what I tell you. In Fortskill lives a man named Joe Twist. Find him! Joe Twist will help you with convincing this pigheaded Steele. Huh? Yes, Joe has experience in a very specific field. - Good morning, Doctor! - Good morning. Steele is a real slave driver, making you wake up so early. Dr. Jones and I can show up whenever we want. In that case, let's take a little walk. #How much is Steele paying you? $200 a week. If an American had your experience, - Steele would be paying him over $1,000. - Yes, General. - Aren't you interested in money? - Not at this moment. So... That means you live for dreams of the future. That must be very effective against melancholia. Melancholia is something us Germans already got rid of. What was your rank in the German army? Colonel in the Special Forces. Us military men should be able to understand each other. Bruce is a shopkeeper, all he thinks of is [...]. In his hands, your boss's invention will take time going into production. You're dreaming of revanche. Help us. And we'll help you repay the Russians for your bitter defeat. How can I help? Where is Steele keeping his notes? I don't know. Probably in the chambers, where he keeps the substance. We need to get them. I wonder where he's off to. And before breakfast, no less. Very well, General. I'll help you get the notes. - How will you do that? - Leave it to me. One more small matter. Do you know of a man in town by the name of Joe Twist? I know him. He's a barkeep, and a former gangster. Thank you... Quiet! I'm indicting you for disturbing the peace and resisting arrest. The fine will be $10. I'm unemployed, I don't have $10. In that case, you get 30 days of hard labor for refusing to pay the fine. I protest! This is unconstitutional! Shut your mouth! Next! Hey you! Get over here, you black ugly mug! Ah, a familiar face! Why, it's Ben! The educated son of Professor Steele's cook. This is what giving Negroes an education gets you. - Name! - Benjamin Robinson. - Who are you? - An American. Silence! You're a dirty Negro! When my brother Jim went to Europe to fight in the war, all the white gentlemen called him an American patriot. He never came back. He died for America. He was a young black man, just like me. Get that darkie out of here! And take his fingerprints! Next! Hey, you! - Name! - Flossie Bates. - Familial status. - Unmarried woman. So you too are trying to teach the US government how to govern? - Sticking your nose in politics! I- did no such thing. I just slapped the preacher. That's not politics. She's telling the truth, boss. Some preacher showed up, trying to get the sinners to repent. He pinched me! That "man of God"... So I let him have it. Your deputies immediately jumped all over me, and stuck me in a squad car with Negroes! What right do they have to keep a white lady with Negroes? Be quiet, you! "Lady". I know the law... - Hello, Mr. Bruce. - Hello, Smiles. Miss, the sheriff is asking for you. Ah, Miss Bates! Please, sit, sit. Will you have a drink with us? So my boys have put you in a car with Negroes? That's too bad. Too bad. Well... Shall we have a drink? - To your health. - To your health. You'll have to excuse us, Miss Bates. When things are a mess, anything can happen. No big deal, what's past is past. And those Negroes, have they, how shall I put this... they haven't forced themselves on you? Oh, please. As if I'd be interested in your Negroes. So you've been "offended". And how would you feel if you were in my place? I understand, I understand. "Offending of a white woman". What are you writing there? Have a drink, we'll be done soon. Miss Bates, and if Negroes would have forced themselves on you, what would you have done? How could they have possibly do that, when the "bulls" were right next to me? Ah, so our policemen have saved you from an assault by those savage Negroes? - What Negroes? - The ones that were there, naturally. If not for the cops, they'd have assaulted you. Which means that our policemen have saved you. What you're saying is an indisputable fact. Of course it's a fact. Well, Miss Bates. Your signature here, please. - And what have you written here? - That would be your testimony. You're free to go, Miss Bates. You can have another one for the road. I'm not going to drink with you. - Mr. Bruce... - Good man, Smiles! Now it's up to the judges. Yes, yes. The district attorney will uphold the indictment. The trial has to be expedited. And then, instead of getting the electric chair, they'll be released into our custody. Your custody... That can create certain complications. But don't you worry about that. THE TRIAL OF FORTSKILL SIX SOON OPENS SIX FORTSKILL NEGROES SENTENCED TO ELECTRIC CHAIR PRETTY BLONDE GIVES EVIDENCE NEGRO STUDENT IS MAIN DEFENDANT WAVE OF PROTESTS IS GROWING, MEETINGS SWEEP COUNTRY TELEGRAMS RECEIVED FROM THE ENTIRE WORLD Here are the latest headlines: The six Negroes will be sentenced in three days. The President announced that he will deny their application for clemency. A group of American scientists has argued that the charges have not been proven. Protests and letter writing have... But we've already heard all that. Yeah, it seems that the Reds have been working hard. Have some coffee. You haven't eaten in two days with all this talk about politics. Too much noise about about some insignificant darkies. I just don't understand what our leaders are doing. Trying to have America police the whole world, but can't manage it at home. I'm so mad that as soon as our boys teach some uppity Negroes a lesson, and immediately the whole world starts protesting. And first in line are of course Soviet writers. What business is that of theirs, how we treat our darkies? Behind these protests is the Communist Party of the USA. And behind that is Red Russia. What? All those people on our streets are Red Russians? That's not exactly how it works, Mrs. Steele. But I do sometimes feel as if those "world educators" have us in their crosshairs. You go on thinking that. What's important is for our business to go on smoothly. We'll continue pretending to be peace-loving people until we capture in our net all the Western European Reds. Note the [...] of their own Pinks. And then!... - Mr. Armstrong. - Mr. O'Connell. Good morning, Mr. Armstrong. On the road again? Moving to a new apartment. Mr. Armstrong, ma'am. I get it that you've got family problems, but why are you crawling around like a snail? I'm sorry... Hello, Missus. Hello, gentlemen. Professor Mac Kennedy, still in military uniform. Still in uniform, Doctor. Professor Armstrong gives us a weekly medical checkup. Today I have another piece of business. How fortunate that all of you are here. Quite a [...]. You've read about what's been going on in our town. Yes, it's terrible how uppity these Negroes have become. You're jumping to conclusions, Mrs. Steele, if you think that six condemned men are really guilty of any crime at all. I don't think that the court would convict innocent people. I hope that everyone here signs this document. A petition demanding the release of good, honest people. Convicted only because they were fighting for peace. Please, Professor. Kindly sign here. My dear Armstrong. I'm with you with all my heart. I hate fascism. And I wear this uniform so I could fight it myself. But I am, after all, an officer. An American officer. - Then you won't sign. - I can't... Believe me, it could've been [...]. And you, Professor Steele? A follower of the world-renowned humanist, O'Connell. You of course appreciate the enormous responsibility that rests upon us scientists. I have no intention of getting involved in politics. You? The most influential person in our town? Why, just one signature of yours, Mr. Steele, could save the lives of six people! I'm sorry, but it's quite impossible. Ma'am! In the name of Jesus Christ, please help me! Have Mr. Steele sign that document! My Ben... My Ben! Mary, your behavior is shameful. - Stand up... - Help me! - ... and mind your own business! Mary! And this is what happens when you pamper them. Mr. Armstrong, why haven't you asked me to sign your petition? You're afraid to. You can tell a lion by his claws. Goodbye to you, Mr. Steele. I haven't had the opportunity to give you a checkup today. And I don't intend to have that opportunity again. In the future, you'll have to use the services of another doctor. I'll be glad if you paid me a visit, Mr. O'Connell. Don't forget to ask Mr. O'Connell to sign your petition! I do intend to sign that document tomorrow. Is that so? Haven't you once worn the uniform of a US officer? I wore it, Mr. Bruce. But I don't anymore. Why have you resigned from the army? Because I believe that at this time, an American uniform lays too heavy on a decent man's shoulders. You're forgetting yourself, O'Connell! I spent too much time as a prisoner in Hitler's death camps. It took a toll on my character. I simply knew that he was a Red! Why Mr. Bruce, my son simply can't be a Red. My friends... It's a fact that people everywhere, under the influence of communists, are expressing their dissatisfaction with our politics. However, the Reds want peace. But my darlings, we want the same thing. All we need is an agreement. An agreement... After all, we can't have America's authority be limited. We're as concerned with America's authority as you are. Mr. O'Connell! Let's speak plainly. I am a US army man on active duty. You are in the army reserves. You love peace, and I love peace. But America is more important and precious than our personal views and opinions. America has dressed herself in armor, and volunteered to police the entire world. Are you willing, as a soldier in the reserves, to help your homeland in this task? What is the nature of your love for your homeland, Mr. O'Connell? My homeland, General, is 140 million Americans. And 135 million of them want to work and live in peace. And precisely that is my homeland. And that is the America that I love. But you prefer an America of invaders, an America of oppressors. The Korean War isn't enough for you. You want another World War. And you'll get it! Without a doubt, you'll get it! Your hopes will be dashed. Before you'll leave for your crusade of looting and pillaging, you will be crushed! "Crushed"! What phoney heroics. We don't want another [...] with tens of millions of casualties. Understand that! And that means that we have to wring your neck before you launch your atomic bombs! Your biological weapons! And your so-called Silver Dust! All your cruel atrocities! You've forgotten the fate of your predecessors, hung at Nuremberg. Get out! You're losing your temper for no reason. I'm leaving. But I'll do all within my power to put you and your friends in prison uniforms! Allan! Apologize! You lost your mind, Allan! Mr. [...], Miss [...]. For him, I'm always home! Excuse me, gentlemen. Hello, Sister Steele. Well, what? What is it? Save Ben! Mr. Steele... He's innocent. I've served you for 20 years. Get out of here. Save Ben! Mr. Steele, he's innocent! I've served you for 20 years! Get out of my way. Out of my way, you black [...]! Help me! Fine... The black woman will get out. But first... she'll tell you! You will hang! You will go insane! A day will come... when you will beg for mercy! To save you from the rage of the people! From the hate of the poverty stricken of all colors! A curse... on all of you! Just look at what's happening in our own home! She's cursing! Cursing us! Poor Sister Doris, calm yourself. The words of black people are meaningless. - Is that so? - Of course. That takes such a load off my mind. It's such a shame that I couldn't make it to last night's seance. But my husband says that driving through town is dangerous now. We took care of everything. All other members of the circle were present. That's terrible... The effect was colossal! Yes... We've been talking about a spiritual seance, gentlemen. The room was dark... The medium, Miss Lippman was lying in her usual place, on the sofa. Suddenly - a scream. An unimaginable tone of voice. Miss Lippman's hands started glowing. We clearly saw her hovering above us. - And then what? - A completely new creature appeared and separated itself her body. It was a man. With an aristocratic, prominent face. Christ Himself. - My God... Yes, Christ Himself. - That's a new one. Sam, I beg of you... Long, white clothes. Barefoot. He walked right up to me. Tell me this, were you alone? Or were there witnesses? There were at least ten of us, and everyone saw and heard His message. You should be quite interested in learning what Christ had to say. Sheriff Smiles asked, "Tell us, Savior, when will the holy war with the communists begin?" And do you know what He answered? "You need to hurry up with that, Sheriff Smiles." Senator Howard asked, "How long can the Reds resist us?" And He answered, "Don't worry". "I will bless My armies, and the Reds won't be able to resist". Which means that Heaven itself is on the side of the globally dominant United States of America. And to think that I missed this incredible miracle. It really is a pity. But we took pictures. Well, it's not the same. Tell me, what do they think over there, in the afterlife, about our Negro issue? Join us sometime, Mr. Bruce. And the Lord will shine a light on your disbelief. I have some important information to deliver to you, Sister Steele. Oh, I'm ready! I'm so fortunate. Excuse me, gentlemen. If I spend even two more days here, Kennedy, I'll go insane from inactivity. That goddamn Steele... It's an opportunity to rest and relax. I personally feel fantastic. Oh, come quickly to God Brothers in Christ To His bright visage Brothers in Christ How fortunate that we're alone, Sister Doris. I've some very important business to discuss with you. Happy to serve you. Another ghost appeared last night - your late husband. What!... He appeared so he could warn you and Mr. Steele. What was he warning us of? The ghost said that you need to get away from Bruce, and from his godless Southern Trust. To His bright visage Brothers in Christ - Excuse me, Mr. Steele. - Who is that... - I'm sorry. - How did you get in here? I represent Brother in Christ Joe Twist. He'd like to inquire whether you received his letter. So it's you! Brother Joe Twist is waiting for an answer. And he would like to insist, again, that you don't do business with the Southern Trust. He's insane! That Brother in Christ of yours... And you, right along with him. What impudence! I'm nobody, Mr. Steele. I'm only delivering a message. Also, Mr. Joe Twist has received evidence about a certain death that took place in the year, if I'm not mistaken, 1933. Wouldn't that be the same year when your boss, Professor O'Connell, has passed on to the Great Beyond? Yes, he poisoned himself. An unfortunate accident. Everyone knows that. - Precisely. Precisely, an unfortunate accident. But two individuals appeared that are willing to testify that the exact opposite took place. Mr. Joe Twist suggests that if an agreement is reached, these two individuals would simply... disappear. And that would be the end of that. Everything could be taken care of without spending a cent. Take for example the very beneficial invention that you've been working on. The Eastern Trust, says Joe Twist, isn't less capable than the Southern Trust, when it comes to chemical manufacturing. This is blackmail! I'm nobody, Mr. Steele. I'm only executing his order. Tell that retired mobster of yours, that he's an infant. An old, naive infant. I haven't been[...] just to get scared of some petty gangster. I'll communicate your answer to Joe Twist. Now get the hell out of here. And tell Twist that if his thugs stick their nose in my business, someone will have a different type of conversation with him. - Fine. I'll deliver your answer. Is he here? Miss Bates, if I'm not mistaken. There's no mistake about it. Flossie Bates. How's life been treating you? - May I sit down? Miss Bates... How did it come to pass, Miss Bates, that you ended up signing this testimony? [...] Listen, buddy. I've had it up to here with this subject. I would imagine so. You realize that these young men will be sent to the chair, for nothing. Everyone's talking about it. You must've heard it around. Must be damn unpleasant to have innocent men get executed because of you. What are you, a preacher? I don't like preachers, buddy. I already got in trouble because of one of them. Do I really look like a preacher? I know the mother of one of those young men. She'll die of grief if her Ben will get executed. It's not too late yet. You just need to recant your testimony, given under duress. What for? I don't give a damn about anyone. Everyone hates me and I hate everyone. I don't feel sorry for anyone. Understand? I don't believe you, Flossie. You're [...]. You're a good girl. Those eyes, they couldn't be a killer's eyes. Hey! Mr. Whatever-Your-Name-Is. What's your business here? I can walk into a bar just like any other American. The bar is mine. I decide who gets invited inside. You've got nothing to say to him. Go in the other room! Stop lecturing me! I'm not a little girl! You do what you're told! Keep your paws to yourself, you're talking to a lady. I'm taking a liking to you, buddy. Just to spite those bastards, I'm going to do what you ask. FLOSSIE BATES RECANTS TESTIMONY EXECUTION OF SIX NEGROES POSTPONED BY ONE DAY SENATOR HOWARD PROTESTS AGAINST POSTPONEMENT OF EXECUTION We ask that you hear us out, Governor. - You're here to see me? - Yes. In that case, you can see me during my office hours. This is a matter where time is of the essence. Human lives are at stake. If you'd like to see me about those rapists from Fortskill, you're wasting your time. I'm already flooded with letters protesting the execution. But this is a new testimony by Miss Bates, witnessed and notarized. It completely contradicts the previous one, which was fraudulently obtained. - It seems to me, Mr... - Armstrong. That a person who's already given false testimony once, can easily do the same thing again. The falseness of the old testimony was obvious. I'm willing to believe that these Negroes have never succumbed to their lustful desires. But they had those desires! They couldn't have not had them! You can't possibly argue otherwise. So my conscience, as a white American, cannot allow me to pardon your defendants. If only for the sake of the safety of my daughters! You refuse to pardon people who you yourself can confirm are innocent? Why, that's monstrous! First of all, I refuse to continue a conversation conducted in this tone of voice. You're disorderly individuals! Simply insolent! They're burning a cross. Just like when they killed Jimmie Harper. Just like when they killed the son of old [...]. We need to show the Negroes who's in charge in this country. That bitch Flossie won't be able to help them. My hands are just itching to put a bullet in some darkie. They're going to transport the Negroes into a Chicago jail. If we don't take the law into our own hands, - those Negroes will be exonerated! - We'll see... The boys will want to wet their whistles. Get another crate of whisky, Jim. Those [...] from the mountains are all teetotalers. Then for them get a couple of crates of Coca-Cola. The Grand Dragon has arrived! What do we do, boss? We need to call the sheriff. I tried to get him, but couldn't find him anywhere. Open those gates! Stop that noise, boys. Get out of here! Are you one of those Negro lovers? I don't give a damn about your excuses. Get me the sheriff, dead or alive. I'm going to get you prosecuted! Whatever Bruce says goes! I'm giving you 30 seconds. I'll find that sheriff. What a stupid turn of events. Are we going to do if those nitwits hang our Negroes? What's going on? Mr. Bruce himself, you say? What bug crawled up his ass? I'm listening, Mr. Bruce. Yes, yes. This is Sheriff Smiles. Sheriff Smiles, listen to me carefully, and don't ask any unnecessary questions. Get the police department off their asses, and stop that lynching. The Negroes cannot be hanged. But we're already late, Mr. Bruce. I'm so screwed... Fine. I'll do whatever's in my power, Mr. Bruce. I'll do everything. OK, sound the alarm. I swear to God, boys, I wouldn't want to spoil your fun. But these Negroes have been sentenced to go to the chair. And those that were sentenced to be fried, can't be hanged. Great. The material has been delivered. Are you educating yourself, General, about how to deal with big businessmen? Steele will start his experiments tomorrow. Yes, of course. Of course he will. Listen up, Kennedy. I've got important business to take care of. But I'll be back in two days. You're staying on as my representative. Don't even think of playing both sides. The Southern Trust will never forgive you. I'd be a man with no conscience if I even considered... A conscience is a good thing to have. If I only knew where you were hiding yours. Well, Doctor? Waiting for the last minute? Tomorrow the experiments will be done with, and Bruce will receive the process formulas. We need to act immediately. You told me that Steele is keeping the formulas in his safe. - Yes, I did. - When will I be getting them? You'll get them tomorrow. It seems to me, Harry, that this was 100 years ago. That's one amusing little book. That's no little book, Harry. It's a mighty explosion of the spirit of the Reich. Yeah, that's what I said. There's a lot of worthwhile ideas in here. - But I don't understand all of it yet. - It's not a thing to be understood. It's a thing that can only be felt. To be perceived not by the mind, but by the blood. This is of course possible only for those in whose veins flows the blood of the white race. But I'm a pureblooded white man. - I'm perceiving it. - I know that you're a real American. But a pureblooded Aryan, Harry, is born with the psychology of a conqueror. A man who stands above everyday morality. I stand above morality too. Going out with your buddies to take potshots at Negroes is not the same thing as being above good and evil. So what should I do? It's not a thing that can be explained. But, for example... Would you, if it was required of you, be able to coldly and calculatingly destroy familial bonds? To go against your own father? - Temperature ready, sir. - Thank you, Jones. Today is a big day for us. We'll be activating the entire supply of Silver Dust. I will now transfer the material for irradiation. Affirmative. Turning on the device. That's strange. Why is the boss activating the material? And so much of it? Maybe there's another batch of monkeys coming in? There haven't been any new monkeys. - Strange... - How are things, Dick? Everything is ready, sir. Activate the transporter. You're free to go, Dick. I'll rest for a bit. But I'll be expecting you later tonight. I'm going to be needing you. - Yes, sir. What might be the matter, James? Keep an eye on the instruments, and I'll go see Schneider to find out what's going on. To what do I owe the pleasure, dear colleague? I'm trying to find out whether there's some mistake. Why activate it if there are no animals? We mustn't question the boss's instructions. we must do as he says. I'm so sick of this constant game of secrets. Any idiot can understand that we're working on a new type of weapon. If that's true, then what's the difference? Actually there really is no difference. - [...] - Get away from the window! Yeah, right! Stop giving me commands, this isn't Buchenwald! Get away, I tell you! What is this! There's a person in there! Why, that's Ben! Our Mary's son! There's no one there! Calm down your nerves, colleague. You're trying to... run experiments on live people? I'm following my orders. I'm a scientist, not an executioner! Do you understand? I'm a scientist! Colleague, there must be something wrong with your mind. Imagining some "people". But I'll still give you a piece of advice. Don't breathe a word to anyone about what you've seen here. Or else you yourself will end up keeping this Negro company. - Yes. Yes, of course. - And there won't be a soul that's going to step in to defend you. In all of this Christian, godly country of ours. Dad... Hello, Jimmy. Is Dr. Schneider in the lab? Dad asked me to give this key to him. Help me! What happened? How dare he... That scoundrel... You scoundrel! I need... I need... What are you... Save... Save me! I can't breathe... What happened? Harry? Harry? What are you doing? A terrible thing has happened. What have you done to him? Let me go! Harry... Harry... Harry! Harry is dying! Harry! What exactly happened? I couldn't understand you over the phone. - I'll speak plainly. - I'm listening. I have reason to suspect... Actually, I'm fairly certain, that it's impossible to save my son. Then why have you called for me? Honestly, for my wife's sake. And why do you think that your son can't be saved? - Because I know. - But you're a chemist, not a doctor! That doesn't matter. I know what poisoned my son. So... That means you're familiar with the nature of this poison? I haven't sent for you so that you'll start questioning me! Let's not waste time. I'll see the patient. Dr. Schneider, get the Professor a protective suit. Yes, sir. Please, Professor. - Doris, don't go in there! - No, Sam, I won't. Sam... I'm sure he'll be able to help. He promised he'll do everything in his power. If he'll save Harry... we'll give away $1,000 to the poor. - Okay? - Fine, fine, just leave me alone. Isn't there hope, Professor? No. This terrible invention of Professor Steele's has boomeranged on the inventor himself. My advice to you - get away from this house. Even the walls here smell of death. Some interesting findings, sir. Blood analysis is giving us an extremely different picture. Take a look... I generated these graphs to show a comparison between a man and a monkey. The man seems to be much more sensitive to the effects of the Silver Dust than a chimpanzee. Harry... Damn it... What are your findings regarding Harry? What am I saying... He must be hopeless. Yes, Yes. Hopeless. And please note, Professor, that the exposure to the Dust lasted evidently only 1-2 seconds. It's true. I've seen it with my own eyes. In the same chamber that was used for monkey experiments, there was Ben! I saw him as clearly as I see you now. They obviously decided to test the substance on live humans. And it was only Harry's accident that interfered with their plan. We need to act! The help is gone. The gardener has been dismissed. Where's Mrs. Steele? As you instructed me, I drove her to the spiritualist seance. - What am I to do? - To assist me. Here he comes. Good evening, old man. Let me again express my sympathy. Well, now we can again get down to business. I don't want to talk about anything. We must, Sam. We must. We need to come to an agreement before Bruce returns. I can't! I'm terribly tired. First we get this done, old man. Then you can rest. How dare you... to bring this man in here! As you can see, Doc, your guards haven't shot neither me nor my "thugs". What... What! Excuse me, boss. Honestly, this kind of menial work isn't for me. Twist, get this charlatan out of here. Go, keep watch over there. Goddamn you! What is the meaning of this comedy? Relax, dear friend. Relax. You scoundrel! Scoundrel! Just like that Joe Twist of yours! My friend, what's with all this coarse language? Sam, I have a suspicion that you've hidden away the process formulas. You bandit! Such a disgusting trick, and in my own house! And again you interrupt me, Sam, old man. You see for yourself that there's no point in fighting. The game is over, Sam. Over. Accept it as an inevitability, and you'll start feeling better. - You've gone crazy! - Doctor, search Mr. Steele. You better think of God, Sam, old man. I'm not a religious man myself. But who knows, God just might exist. This isn't it. Yes... Well, let's try to make a deal. Prepare the schpritz, Schneider. Sam, you can probably guess that we need every single detail of the production of Silver Dust. Us, specifically. Not Bruce. And you will give us those formulas. If you don't want to die of a "heart attack". Make up your mind quickly, boss. Have mercy on me! Mercy! - Everything is ready. - Faster! Where are the notes? Bastards! You're letting your temper run away from you again, Sam. Law of the jungle, old man. You understand? Faster! Where are they? I had the basic formulas committed to memory. The coronary artery spasm can wait. Get a piece of paper, Schneider. And take dictation. I'll tell you nothing! Nothing! You won't get one grain of Dust for analysis! I activated all of it! You understand? All of it! It'll disappear! Disintegrate after a few days! [...] Just try touching it! [...] He dropped dead. Gone! Ben! Easy, easy... Dirty work... You're an idiot! And a nonentity! You've sold yourself to McWood! Tomorrow I'll call to congratulate him on this shiney new purchase. You dirty swine! You bandit! You shopkeeper! Sit down! Right now! - All exits are being guarded. - Don't be an idiot, O'Connell. Drop that tone. - You killed him. - I swear... He just died... of heart failure. I don't know anything. I just arrived. You're an outsider. This has nothing to do with you. And Steele's papers? The ones you stole? - We didn't take anything! - There were no papers! He had all the formulas committed to memory! The old fox! Let's go, friends. So that we won't get caught in the wheels of American justice. Take a look at those faces. The faces of [...] jackals. Ah! The sheriff is going to have a word with you now. You'll spend your final days on trial, judged by the people. And then the gallows for you. Don't forget that the electric chair is still out there, waiting for you. You can execute me, but that won't save your skin.
