(whooshing) (mellow melodic music) (footsteps tapping) (guns firing) (light melodic orchestral music) (background chattering) (phone ringing) - Where are you? - [Charles] You are so dead, motherfucker. (somber orchestral music) - Who's the guy? - He's a guy, that's into some heavy action, shh! Thank you, Lindsay. - No problem. - Hey, you like chow mein? - Yeah, chow mein's good - They got the best in the city, we'll have that. - You got it. - Cheers. Things are lucrative, but I wanna do some highline gigs. I'll set up the entire jobs, but I need someone with your skill sets to execute. - I'm pretty good on my own. - I'm talking taking down some major scores here. - I'm not interested in doing any cowboy scores or home invasions, Ray. - I'm talking banks, jewelry stores, racetracks, he's gonna give us anything we need, cars, equipment, guns, he'll lay out the entire score and all we have to do is take it down. - I'm doing fine now. - I already told him about you and he wants to meet you. I have to prove to him that you're worth the money he's willing to put up. - (sighing) What do you want from me? - I need you to do a score for me. - Really? - Yeah, you owe me one after all the times I saved your ass in the can. - There you go. - Thank you. - [Lindsay] No problem. - I don't know, what's the job? Is it on the prowl or strong? - It's on the prowl, office building, after hours, quick safe crack, getting a stash of bearer bonds. - How many on the crew? - Two, three tops. - Whose office? - Does it matter? - Yeah, I like to know who I'm ripping off. - He's a real estate hustler, a fucking nobody. - [Johnny] How did you come across bearer bonds? - I did a stretch in Q with a guy that does security for the building, he's got the layouts, the schematics, the alarm codes and get this, the key to the back door. - What's my end? - 150K and you pay your crew out of that. - What's your end? - My end is my fucking business. You interested or not? - Window to prep? - Has to happen tonight, they're moving the bonds in the morning. - I need more time than that. - It's an easy gig, it's a fucking smash and grab. Let's eat our food, I'll take you outside and I'll show you the details and then you decide, alright? Come on, eat up, I love this stuff. Okay, back door's here, you've got to open that with a key. The alarm pad is right there and I'll give you the code. - Okay, what about surveillance cameras? - No, they're down at the moment, my guy's delayed repair, so we can do the job. - Hey, what about cops, any regular patrols? - It's an isolated area, if you enter from the back, nobody can see anything from the street in the front. - I don't need it. - It's better to have one and not need it, than need one and not have it. - I'm good. - Alright, so meet me at a regular spot and we'll settle up after you get the bonds, I'll see you in the morning. - Okay. (mellow melodic music) (car engine starting) (light melodic music) (police radio broadcasting quietly) (police radio broadcasting quietly) (electronic whirring) - Excuse me, miss, can I help you? (police radio broadcasting quietly) Don't move! (cocking gun) Don't move, put your hands on the wheel. I wanna see both hands, put them on the wheel. Do not make me shoot you. Just keep 'em right there. Keep your hands on the wheel. (gun firing) (screaming) (breathing heavily) (car engine starting) (car speeding away) (light melodic music) - We are pretty good, right? - I'd say better than good. - What if we just quit right now? Then we can go down to Mexico, start a whole new life there. - I don't know. - I want us to be safe. I don't want my child-- - Wait, what are you talking about a kid for? - I was gonna tell you earlier, I'm pregnant. - Are you serious? - Yeah. - [Johnny] Baby, that's amazing! - Really? - God, I love you. - I love you. So what do you think, can we? - As soon as I offload the bonds to Ray, we're gone. - I love you. - I love you too. - Hey, Johnny. - What the fuck? The place was supposed to be empty. - What are you talking about? - You set me up! - That's not true, I didn't do anything. - Fuck this, just give me the money! Don't waste my time, asshole! - We had over 3500 bank robberies nationwide last year, Los Angeles is the bank robbery capital of this nation. The suspects we're dealing with have no restraint, do you think you could go with that? - Yes, I can, sir. - I'm partnering you off with Agent Ellis, he has a somewhat unorthodox style, but probably the best agent I've ever had the pleasure of working with. Listen to what he says and watch what he does, he might just save your life. - I will, I will not let you down, sir. (somber melodic music) - [Chen] How have you been? - What's the use of bitching, you wouldn't listen anyway. - I assume you're doing quite well? I hear you're getting a lot of action on the streets. - Got any objections? - Not at all, as long as you don't forget about your obligations to me. - I don't have it. The Super Bowl, the races, the casino, I'm wiped out. I know you're expecting it, but I'm gonna need more time. - It's just not me, you know, I have people to answer to as well. - Whatever you can do, you know I'm good for it. (light haunting music) - Suppose we make it 50K, except the 100 you owe me. You pay me the gig at 25%, so now pay me the 20 that you owe me now, how's that? - I don't even have 50 bucks in my pocket right now. - Don't make me come after you like this, I'm not the bad guy here. - Just give me two weeks, I can get you the money. - Alright, you've got two weeks and if I were you, I'd pull that treasure map and start digging, 'cause if you don't have it by then, well, it won't be me coming after you, but some people who are not as patient as I am. (thudding blow) - Uh! - You think you can steal our shit and get away with it? What were you thinking, you stupid motherfucker? - I fucked up, I know. - Who else was in on it? Give me a name, motherfucker! - Johnny, Johnny Clay. That's all I know. I don't know anything. - Relax, relax, that's good work. We're gonna let you go, don't worry. We're gonna let you go. You're a good guy. (dramatic music) (screaming) (loud thudding) Welcome to the party, pal. - [Amanda] Johnny, what is going on? - Who the fuck are you guys? - Angels of death and these are the end times. - Don't fucking touch her, who sent you? - We're in charge, sit down. Sit down, come on. Good boy. - [Johnny] What the fuck do you guys want? - Your friend Ray really fucked you over. - [Johnny] Who? - Hey, let me refresh your recollection. (light haunting music) Real nice partner there, it took him all of like, I don't know, five minutes to give you up. - Look, I'll give you guys whatever you want, just leave us alone. - Does this look like a negotiation, pal? You're already dead, along with this fine piece of ass, though we may keep her around long enough to enjoy her right before we kill her. (thudding blow) (mellow melodic music) - You guys don't have to do this. Whatever you want, I'll give it to you. - Shut the fuck up! - Do whatever you want to me, just let her go, okay. - You don't have any moves left, pal. - Who's your boss? Huh? Let me talk to him, tell him I got a score, a bank. - You're not talking your way out of this shite. - Hey, wait, hey, what are you talking about? - Just let me talk to him, it's a big job, just tell him he's gonna make so much fucking money off this. - How do I know you're telling the truth? - 'Cause if I don't deliver, you can still kill me. So what, it costs you nothing to try. - He's bullshitting you, he's a liar, he's Jack shit, let's kill them now. - Shut the fuck up and let me think. - I'm not taking the heat, 'cause you're too chicken shite to do this. (mellow dramatic music) (thudding blow) (gun firing) - Fuck! - No, stop! Hey, look at me, look at me, look at me, stay, stay, stay with me. Hey, no, no, no. (breathing heavily) Look at me, hey, look at me. Fuck, fuck! No, hey, hey, hey, you. - Don't feel this. - Hey, okay. - Don't feel this. - Don't go, don't, stay. Fuck! - [Miles] Don't even think about it! (breathing heavily) (somber melodic music) - This is Sam Erinow, they call him the Rabbi, he runs a lot of organized crime including bookmaking, drugs, prostitution rings in LA and Vegas. This is Charles Cohen, he's the Rabbi's nephew, he used to work for the Rabbi, but now he's making moves to take over the Rabbi's territory and he's been setting up a lot of crews lately. Rabbi and Cohen are in a war with each other right now. There was an attempt on Cohen's life last year, the word on the street is the Rabbi gave the word. Lately Cohen's been recruiting a lot of highline thieves for robberies, the last one was that Comerica Bank job in Sherman Oaks. In total, this crew's taken down three bank jobs in two months, next time one of these crews comes out of a score, I want us there to take them down, I want you guys working your informants, shake your trees and see if anything falls out. - What's up? - I just wanted to make sure you were ready to be training or recruit right now. - Why not? - Well. - Look, Captain, I'm fine, I'm going to the meetings, I'm working my steps, I'm not on the tables anymore, I haven't made a bet in six months. - Look, we've known each other a long time, don't bullshit me, if you're not ready-- - I need this right now. - I don't know if you knew this, but back in the early '90s, I worked night watch for the LAPD. My training officer was Mike Furmer. - What, the OJ case, right? - Back then, Furmer was a straight shooter, one of the most professional officers I ever met. (sighing) When I worked with him, he was a good cop, but as you know, something happened along the way, I don't know, could be bad instincts. - Yeah. - Look you're an exceptional agent, I just don't want you going down the same road as Furmer. - I get it. - If you fuck up, this is not just your ass on the line, it's mine too. - I won't let you down, Captain. - 'Cause if something happens, I mean, I hear anything, anything happening, that is it, there's nothing I can do about it. Okay? - Yeah. (water gently splashing) - So you're the guy that thinks it's okay to steal from me, huh? You know, you took out my best security guard? What were you thinking, man, do you know who the fuck I am? - I do know who you are and if would've known the bonds were yours, I wouldn't have taken the gig. - Don't bullshit me, you're a thief, a good one, I hear, but still just a thief. - It wasn't personal, I'm a professional, it's just business, so be that as it may, I'm here to make good on my transgressions. - Oh yeah, well, I heard some pretty hairy shit went down in the desert with your woman, but it was just business, nothing personal. Tell me why I shouldn't take you out right now and bury you right next to her. - 'Cause I have a job that I think you'd appreciate, it's a bank-- - I'll stop you right there. I'm not taking down any more banks, there's too much heat and I only bet on a sure thing. Besides, I don't fucking trust you, how do I know this whole pitch isn't a setup? - Okay, then why don't you just kill me right now then? - For a guy in your position, you got some balls, I gotta respect that. I've got something else in mind. - I'm listening. - I want you to take down Santa Anita Racetrack. - Why a racetrack, there's not much cash in those? - I got a guy on the inside, he tells me there's like five million in cash, maybe more. I used to get a cut of that action, till they decided they didn't need me anymore. - What's my end? - I get three force, you keep one, you pay your crew out of your cut and take Miles with you, I want him working on this, I want my crew in on this. - And if I refuse? - Oh, you're gonna do the job and if you try to fuck me over again, I'll have you taken out, shot, tortured, torn apart, your family made ugly, raped, killed. You see, you don't make the deals, I make the deals and you're gonna do what I say, until I say otherwise, is that clear enough for you? - I do this, we're even. (water splashing gently) - What's going on over here? - [Charles] None of your fucking business. Hey, get your fine ass out of the pool, we're going out tonight and put the red dress on, I like that one. (light haunting music) Hey, stay the fuck away from her, last guy made a move on her, well, he's no longer with us. - This is Jackson Davis, the guy that Miles sent over, your new driver. - Huh, can you shoot? - Yeah, really well. - Where'd you learn? - Special Forces. - Hm, do anything heavy? - Yeah, a few jobs. - Where, with who? - Let's see, Trehoe and then Warren down in Dallas. - Grendel Warren? - Yeah, you know him? - I knew him, the guy's a fucking rat, he's dead. - Huh, I didn't know that. - Well, everybody does their job, everybody gets what they need, let's go. (mellow melodic music) (footsteps tapping) - What have you got for me? - Nothing. - Come on, you know how this works, you stop giving me information, I call your PO, violate your ass and you're back in the can tonight. - I might have heard something. - What is it? - They're talking to some new guy about some job. - Who's the guy? - Never seen him before. - What about the job? - Something about taking down a racetrack. - When? - I don't know. - Well, you'd better get real smart real fast. Give me some details, you got it? - Yeah, I got it. (car engine starting) (somber melodic music) (gun firing) (whooshing) - Agent Ellis, as you are aware as per agency policy, when there is an officer involved shooting, we must conduct an internal investigation to make sure that everything was done according to proper procedure. Do you have any questions? - I understand the process. - Are you currently in an alcohol treatment program? - Is this really relevant? - Just answer the question. - Yes. - On the day of the incident, you were working in a supervisory capacity, is that correct? - Yes, that is correct. - On April 11, 2016, your trainee, Samantha Rowe shot a suspect. - Yes, as I explained to the officer on the scene, must we go through all of this again? - We are trying to determine your state of mind during the incident and whether you are fit to continue your duties. - State of mind? I did not shoot anyone and unless you were there, you don't know what the fuck you're talking about. (gun firing) Whoa, what the fuck? (breathing heavily) - [Samantha] He was reaching for something. Is he dead? - We are simply trying to ascertain whether Agent Rowe exercised the proper discretion and restraint prior to firing the weapon and if her actions could've been the result of failed supervision. Can you describe the events of the day? - We approached a suspect, who had been an FBI informant in the past. - Dexter Raines? - Yes, Mr. Raines, we approached him, he immediately took off running, we took chase, Agent Rowe was slightly ahead of me, when we followed him over a footbridge. - Then what happened? - There was a blind corner and as I turned the corner I saw that he was reaching for a weapon. - Did he draw the weapon on you? - No, he did not. - How do you know he had a weapon? (light haunting music) - When I approached the suspect, he was already down. - Then what did you do? - I immediately checked for a weapon on him or within reach. - I was coming round the corner and then he turned round and it looked like he was grabbing or reaching for something. - God, I can't believe this, there's nothing here, you just shot an unarmed man! We're gonna lead the fucking news tonight! - Fuck me, are you sure? I swear he was reaching for something! - Did you find any? - Yes, we discovered a Walther PPK in his right-hand pocket. Once I removed the weapon, I realized that the suspect had expired. - What was your reaction to the shooting? - I couldn't believe what was happening, but I remained calm and I worked the scene as I'd been trained to do. - What did you do once Agent Ellis arrived on the scene? - After he arrived and removed the weapon from the suspect's pocket, he called for backup. - I can't believe this, they're gonna crucify us for this. - Okay, it's my fault! - No, that's not that easy. - I'll take the heat. - It's not that easy, this falls on me too, we're both taking the fall for this. - Did you see the weapon that the suspect was carrying? - Yes. - Did you delay in calling for backup? - I don't understand the question. - Let me rephrase. Is it your opinion that everything was handled in accordance with the Bureau's proper policies and procedures for a shooting incident? - Yes, that is my opinion. - Give me a second to think! (light suspenseful music) - [Samantha] Think about what? He's fucking dead, we need to call it in! (breathing heavily) Ellis, no! No, we cannot do this! - Don't tell me what we cannot do, we have to do this. - No. - Or we're both screwed. - I don't know about this. - Can you describe the weapon that was taken from the suspect? - It was a Walther PPK. - Had the weapon been fired? - No, it had not. - Looking back on the incident, is there anything you would have done differently? - I did what I thought I had to do and what was right, in order to protect myself and my partner. - Well, you'd better get on board fast, or they're gonna decide for us really fast. (helicopter whirring) (light haunting music) (sirens wailing in distance) - Thank you, Agent Rowe, that will be all. (mellow melodic music) (background chattering) (muffled commentary by track announcer) (crowd shouting encouragement) - Can it be done? - We need more men. - How many? - I'd say at least five, one on the lookout, two moving diversions, that way we can take out the guards on the inside. - Who do you have in mind? - Alright, alright, what have we got? We got semi-automatic, assault rifles, we got the M733, this is a bad motherfucker, you come in with two of these, you look like Stallone, alright, fucks you up like Iraq, beautiful. Pistols, 1911, .45, got it in black, got it in silver, match your outfit, you know, this is a beautiful gun, single action, magazine-fed, recoil operated handgun used in every major conflict since World War I, never misfires, extremely reliable, you know, I vouch for it, you know, kind of like, ooh! Beretta FS92, this thing holds up two 15 rounds, I can sell you an off-market, extended clip holds 30 hollow-point rounds. - I don't know, why hollow-points? - Why the fuck not, you know, you want 'em to stay down or you want 'em to get back up? - Alright, look, I'll take the assault rifles for sure, I need the sniper rifle. (clearing throat) I need a handgun that can hit a little harder than these. - Johnny, I thought you'd never ask, you know, I got a .44 Magnum in the car, alright, that is the most powerful handgun in the world, you know, "You feeling lucky, punk, do you?" - Are all these clean? - Johnny, it's Uncle Money you're talking to, what kind of fucking question is that? (birds twittering) - You still looking to do some munitions jobs? (mellow melodic music) (background chattering) (gun firing) (gun firing) (mellow melodic music) - What? - [Johnny] It's me, you busy? - Stick out dash. What's up? - Look, something's gonna go down sometime soon, are you down? - Always. (mellow melodic music) (ocean lapping shore) What is it? - [Johnny] Sniper job. - Target? - It's a horse. - What the fuck, Johnny? - For certain reasons, particularly for your safety, I'm not gonna go into detail, 'cause the less you know, the better. - How much? - [Johnny] Say 50K? - What kind of horse is it? - It's a racehorse, next Saturday at the Santa Anita Racetrack, they're running the 100K Handicap, during the 7th race, there's gonna be a horse running called Morning Glory, that's the horse I need to go down, but just tranq it, you don't have to kill it. There's plenty of buildings nearby to provide for cover and a clean shot and provide for a clean getaway that way, when things go down. Don't make me say please. - I'll do it, Johnny, just because I like you. (ocean lapping shore) (knocking on door) - Hello. - What do you want? - Can we talk? - About what? - It'll just take a moment. - Does Cohen know you're here? - What do you think? Come on, you gonna let me in or what? (door closing) - [Johnny] Can I get you something to drink? - Bourbon, neat. - [Johnny] So what's this about? - Is this your wife? - Amanda. It's my wife. - [Lily] What happened to her? - I'd rather not talk about it. - Oh, I'm sorry. - You're sorry, I'm sorry, everyone's sorry. - I shouldn't have come here. - It's fine, what do you wanna tell me? - I know why you're working for Cohen. - Well, doesn't that make you the smart one? - I know what I must look like to you. - [Johnny] I don't even know you. From what I've seen so far, I'm not that impressed. - Well, I think we can help each other. - How's that? - The Santa Anita Racetrack, that's about five million give or take. - Not that it matters to you, but yeah, give or take. - How do you feel about taking half and hanging Cohen out to dry in the process? - Sounds like a one-way ticket to the morgue. - I don't think you see the whole picture. - Yeah, enlighten me. - Cohen and the Rabbi used to run a bookie operation at the Santa Anita, they had a falling out a few years back and the Rabbi cut him out of it, he's taking it down to get back at him. Once the heist goes down, he's just gonna kill him and his entire crew. - So what are you proposing? - We take it all, we split it evenly and then go our seperate ways. I know some people that can get us out of the country, Cohen will never find us. - Are you out of your fucking mind? How are you gonna do that? - There are a few details I haven't worked out yet. - Lady. - It's Lily. - Lily, I trust you about as far as I can fucking throw you, wait, I don't even trust you at all, you're bad for both of us, you need to leave. (door opening) Goodnight. (sighing) (birds twittering) - Hey, where were you last night? - [Lily] Out. - Where? - I was at a club with Olivia, what's it matter to you? - What's it matter to me? Who do you think you are? I make your life possible, the clothes, the cars, the vacations, it's all because of me. If it wasn't for me, you'd be turning tricks down on Sunset Boulevard right now! - Hey, hey, hey, you know I appreciate it, I do. - Alright. Don't give me reason to doubt you. Can I expect your loyalty? - Yeah. - Yeah? (laughing) (birds twittering) - What have you got for me? - It's happening Saturday during the big race at Santa Anita. - A heist? - Yes. - That's Rabbi's action, Cohen's out of his mind. (phone alerting) Who's on the crew? - Miles and some new guys, Jackson Davis and Johnny Clay. - Clay, he did the Valley BFA job a couple of years back, I could never nail him for it. Where are they meeting to divide up the money? - I don't know yet. - Get me details, I wanna hear from you soon. (background chattering) Let me try something on you. I'm working a CI, who tells me that Cohen is planning on taking down Santa Anita Racetrack on Saturday, it's a huge score. - So? - What do you think? - About what? - We let them take the track, then we take them down, keep the cash ourselves. If it turns to shit, we walk away, turn it over to the locals. - You gotta be kidding me, are you this jammed out that you're even considering doing something this stupid? - We need this after the shit we've had, we need a bust like this. - Bullshit, I don't care, I'm not gonna pull a heist. - All I'm asking you to do is back me up. - You're out of your mind. - Look, I need this. - Find someone else. - Will you just listen to me for a moment? - My father was a cop, my brother is a cop, okay, what you're asking of me goes against everything that I was brought up on. - Look, I saved your ass with that shooting board and I put my life in the balance, you would be out of the Bureau and hip-deep in shit, so save me your self righteous indignation, I've heard it too many times before. - Look, I appreciate what you did for me, I do, but I cannot be a part of this, okay, I'm sorry. - Well, you'd better get yourself into protection, because you're on your own. (traffic rumbling quietly) (knocking on door) - [Lily] Vodka, rocks. - So you wanna tell me about Special Agent Ellis? - Why should I tell you anything? - Let's just say it's in your best interest to do so. - What do you wanna know? - [Johnny] How long has he been working you as a CI? - Six months. I got busted for possession and he gave me a choice, either work as a CI or go to jail for a year. - I'm gonna assume Cohen has no idea you were busted? - No, are you kidding? - I did some checking, he's running you off book, no reports. - So? - He was suspected in the theft of a drugs seizure a few months back and IAD put him under the lamp, but they didn't turn any evidence. Plus he's a fucking degenerate gambler, who always loses. Word on the street is he's into a guy named Chen Liu for over 100 grand and they're squeezing him. - I don't know what this has to do with me. - You're not that stupid. I think you're setting him up to take the score, so you can take it from him. - I don't know what you're talking about. - You know, it only takes me a second to dime you out to Cohen? - You won't do it. - What makes you so sure? - Because you see the angle here too, if you wanted to throw me under the bus, I wouldn't be sitting here right now, plus there's no benefit in it for you. - You still wanna make this work? But you gotta do what I say, otherwise I go to Cohen, got it? (light melodic music) - Can I ask you something personal? - Yeah, go ahead. - How did you meet your wife? (sighing) - My Dad was in and out of prison and my Mom, she ODed when I was 10. When my Dad went out for his last stretch, I got put into foster care and I bounced around from home to home till I was 17, that's when I met Amanda in a halfway house. Just one of those things, you know, when you meet the right person and you just, you know. That ever happen to you? (mellow melodic music) - [Miles] You mean there's gonna be two other people in on the deal and we're not gonna know who they are? - You don't know who they are, they don't know who you are. - Why do we need 'em? - Because one's a sharp shooter, the other's a weapons specialist and they're gonna create a distraction, so we can execute this job. - How much are they cutting in on this? - They're getting paid a flat fee to perform certain duties at certain times and their fee's coming out of my end. - Well, if they're getting paid in advance, how do we know they're gonna do their job? - Because they're professionals, I've worked with them before and I vouch for them, got it? - How much is gonna be in the vault on the day of the heist? - Give or take a few thousand, the whole take on the deal, we're looking at five or six mill. - How do you know that's all gonna be in there, when we hit these guys? - Because money's not allowed to accrue at any one point at the track, it all gets funneled to the count room and there in the count room, it goes in the safe, it's stored in the safe, until it's picked up by armored car, that arrives and parks directly in front of the clubhouse by five o'clock, that's why we've got to go before five, because if the armored car shows up, the window's gone. There's gonna be weapons waiting for us stashed in a bathroom that's down for renovations, we're gonna pick up the weapons there, work our way to the elevators, take the elevators down to the first floor to the ticket offices, there we move through to the count room, handle the guards. - What about the alarms? - Cut 10 minutes before we go, we got a man inside. - How many guards? - Three, one at the front, two in the count room. It's possible police could have a rover in the area, but it shouldn't be in the immediate vicinity. - What about the exits? - Three exits, once the distraction's created, we're gonna filter out just like track customers. - What about the vault? - Time-locked, so it should open five minutes before they start doing business. Once we get the cash, a bomb's gonna be detonated in the parking lot, it'll give us enough distraction to escape. But we've got five minutes max to move out of there, then every cop in the immediate area's gonna be on us. - Don't you think we're going in a little hard on this? - Why? - Because it's a fucking racetrack, no need to go all Neil McCauley on this one, don't you think? - McCauley got killed. Once this goes down, we meet back here in my apartment, wait for the dust to settle, divvy the cash, got it? - (sighing) So why this place, is it safe? - Because I've lived here 10 years and I know everybody that lives here, I know their routines, their patterns and the cops don't run patrols here. So in case anything happens, there's plenty of exits, plenty of escapes, there's two freeway entrances within two miles. - Alright, hot shot, you're the superstar, but here's the thing, if you fuck this up, it's your ass, not mine. (cracking knuckles) (traffic rumbling quietly) - How sure is this deal? - It's pretty certain. - The time? - Noon, and then after they take the money, they're supposed to meet back at Clay's apartment in Sherman Oaks to divide up the cash. - Do you have the address? - Yeah, I'll text it to you. - How do you know all of this? Why's he given you so much access? - Men just talk to me, I'm a very good listener. - This better be legit, or I-- - I know. - [Agent Ellis] Is that everything? - Are you gonna take it down? - I'm still thinking about it. - We haven't discussed my end. - Fuck your end, you're lucky I-- - Don't fuck with me. You're working me off the books, none of this is legit. - What are you talking about? - How do you think your supervisor's gonna feel about you pulling off a heist? - You're not gonna say anything, you've got too much to lose. - Hm, guess we'll just have to see how it plays out. - Alright, 10%. - 50. - Fuck that, 25. - 35. - Fine. - 35 and after this, we're done. - Alright. - [George] We've gotta try and get out of here, if they don't get us first. (sirens wailing in distance) - [Man] Get 'em out of there, Fowler. Get 'em out of there, get 'em out of there. - [Uncle Money] No, don't do it, don't do it. - What are you? - Make way for a hostage. - Kill her, he might do it. - What are you, an animal or something? - What's it gonna be, 'cause I'll kill you right now. (laughing) I'm not going back. - You and me both, buddy. (screaming on TV) I could've called that one. Oh-oh, you're gonna do this locked. Smoking this place out, gonna burn something up. (traffic rumbling quietly) - I thought about what you said, you're right, I do owe you. But if we're gonna do this, I have some conditions. - Alright. - Ideas that won't get us caught and killed. If we're gonna do this, we're gonna do it my way. - Alright, let's see what you got. (mellow melodic music) (footsteps tapping) (mellow melodic music) (footsteps tapping) (starter bell ringing) - They're off! (crowd shouting encouragement) (muffled commentary by track announcer) (background chattering) (mellow melodic music) (mellow upbeat music) (mellow melodic music) (guns firing) (mellow upbeat music) (knocking on door) - [Johnny] Open the door! We're here for the track's money, not yours! - [Jackson] Don't be a hero, mate! - [Man] I'm not your fucking mate! - [Jackson] Last chance! - [Man] Fuck you! (thudding) (gun firing) (mellow upbeat music) (crowd shouting encouragement) (muffled commentary by track announcer) (gun firing) (mellow melodic music) (car exploding) (crowd shouting in panic) - [Announcer] Please remain calm, please do not panic. - [Jackson] How much did we get? - [Johnny] I'd say close to six. - We'd better wait here then. Fucking A. What are you gonna do with your share? - Let's not get ahead of ourselves. We've still got a long way to go before we're out of the woods. (sighing) (phone alerting) - Oh, fuck! - What's that? - We've got an APB out on us! - What the fuck, man, they got us on security footage? What are we gonna do? - Nothing changes, plan stays the same. So what, they've seen us on security footage? We just wait 'em out. - This is nuts, I vote we get out of here right now. Even if you are right, someone could've seen us coming in from the street. - No one's fucking leaving! Last thing I need is you guys hitting the streets causing a panic, that's gonna get people killed, that's gonna bring heat on me and that's gonna bring heat on Cohen. Who here wants to deal with that? - Hey man, I think we should get our fucking heads examined rather than staying here. - Why don't you call Cohen, see what he thinks we should do? - Fuck you, Johnny! (somber melodic music) I should've put your ass down in the desert! Where are you going? - To take a leak, you gonna hold my dick? (clattering in other room) - [Agent Ellis] Give us the cash. - You've been misinformed, Donald, there is no cash. - [Agent Ellis] We know you have it, now hand it over now! - [Samantha] Drop the weapons or we'll fucking kill both of you. - I think we'll take our chances, Hillary. - [Agent Ellis] Just drop them and give us those bags! - [Miles] You drop them first. - [Samantha] This is your last chance, guys. - No, this is your last chance! - Where the fuck is Johnny? - Johnny? What the, wait, how the, how the fuck do you know Johnny? Fuck you! (guns firing) (melodic haunting music) You set us up, motherfucker. (gun firing) (mellow upbeat music) (guns firing) - Oh, my God, you scared the shit out of me. - Where is he? - [Lily] I don't know what you're talking about. (whistling) (light haunting music) (background chattering) (phone ringing) - Where are you? - You are so dead, motherfucker. - What do you want? - You think you can steal from me, massacre my guys and get away with it? - Well, if you want me, come and get me, you know where I'm at. - You know what, fuck it and fuck you, I'm just gonna let you try to run, see how far you get, you're looking over your shoulder all the time wondering when death is coming and it's coming. - What about her? - Why the fuck do you care about her? I'll let my guys do what they want with her, take her out to the desert, put her down like a bitch just like that cunt wife of yours! (melodic haunting music) - Hey boss, I'm going to the kitchen, do you need anything? - No, I'm good. - Alright. - Oh, and stay indoors, I don't want to see you drinking out in the garden, alright? (gun firing) (body thudding to floor) (gun firing) (mellow upbeat music) (gun firing) (gun firing) (gun firing) - Go on, get out of here. Meet me at the airport. (mellow upbeat music) (gun firing) (gun firing) (gun firing) (mellow melodic music) (gun cocking) (gun firing) - You shouldn't have come back for me. (melodic haunting music) (screaming in frustration) (birds twittering) - We need to talk. I've done everything you require. - Good. - Are we even? (speaking in foreign language) (mellow melodic music) (gun firing) (gun firing) (mellow melodic music) (water gurgling) (whooshing) (light melodic music)
