Have you seen today's paper? What is it? "Gin Te Biu suddenly dies in Jail" Mei Li Brother's health had been good His death is questionable Could he have been murdered? It's possible But why? Perhaps all because of that treasure map Can you think who could have done it? If I knew who's behind it... I'll fight him to death Maybe the same person who stole the map Do you still remember his face? I couldn't see clearly Sort of pale and fat ...without eyebrows No eyebrows? That must be Ma Loong Ma Loong? Yes, he used be with us when we were at sea I now understand He must have betrayed brother Brother Poon, I must avenge my brother Come on, let's get that crook Wait Mei Li, don't be so rash If he really stole the map, and killed your brother... They must be well prepared If we went like this all we'd do is stir them up So what should we do? Do you know where Ma Loong lives? Yes We must investigate thoroughly ...before we act Right, we'll go tonight Good... This is the place Wait outside "Gin Te Biu's sudden death in Jail" Wait What should we do? Darling, aren't you coming to bed? Hey, it's me Dead? Search him Nothing Someone must have taken it Let's go Brother Poon Who did this? One-eyed Loong Who's he? Cheung...Biu Looks similar? Looks exactly the same Quick Come and look, quick Looks like he's going out Let's go quickly Something amiss? Loong's blind eye is the left one You're mistaken Come on Alright You're heading out? C'mon, let's test our communication devices Remember, if you see Loong return ...press this I understand. You be careful Weren't you going out? Back so soon, huh! Who is it? It's me, Chan Ah Gun Come in I am Chan Ah Gun Friend of Ma Loong Does my presence intrigue you? I don't know what you mean Ma Loong is dead We should talk What has Ma Loong's death got to do with me? Not only his death but also... Poon Wai Dat's murder How do you know? Of course I do You are the only one famous for using ...the flying dagger Both daggers are proof of the murders You want to blackmail me? Nonsense I have been around too and l ...treasure friendship I'm here to discuss business with you What business? Business related to the treasure map I don't have it Let's be frank about this I tell you honestly The map you got from Ma Loong ...is only half of it There is another half There's another one? Do you know where it is? Of course I do. I wouldn't be here otherwise Okay, let's have your terms I want half of the treasure; Not a penny less Think about it If you don't agree your piece of paper is as good as trash It's useless I'll wait for 2 more minutes then I'll leave Alright, I agree Tell me then Where is the other map? I can only tell you it's with a woman Can you get it? Of course I warn you. Don't play tricks with me you know I can be real bad God, that was close! If I hadn't ducked quickly... my chest would have been stabbed Tang Lui, I'm sorry You have to suffer so much ...for my sake Oh, come on! I have not suffered in vain Really? Though we've failed... we at least know now that there are 2 maps 2 maps? Doesn't that mean more trouble? Presently I only know... that the other part is with some woman We have to get that one first Tonight we'll set out once again Who did this? Excellent marksmanship It's done Did you get it? No How come? I searched everywhere but ...couldn't find it Then that Tang bastard must have got it He is the only one left now You want me to kill him as well? JeeZ, is that the only thing you know? Hopeless, honestly! What are you laughing at? Look What's so funny? Your shot blinded one of his eyes One-eyed Loong? Did you look inside his eye? His eye ball? No It's got to be in there. Go quickly Have you found it yet? Right, this is it Hang on...how come he came after it, too? Maybe the other half of the map ...is with HlS woman Let's go We'll discuss when we get back Tang Lui Thanks What are you thinking about? Thinking about Ying Nian at the Blue Pool night club A solitary dude meditating at tranquil of the sea; Must be some poetic sentiments! You misunderstand me Since that Kwok fellow also went to the mortuary I reckon the other half of the map ...must be with Ying Nian But these two are difficult to deal with So I have thought of a plan A plan? Are you sure it'd work? You have to put on a show with me A show? We'll go to the Blue Pool night club tomorrow night Sorry, we're full already Well, I Just reserved a place over the phone Oh, over there please The fish has caught the bait You must act real in a while Don't worry. I'm an actor; can't go wrong Welcome, welcome, Mr. Tang Have a seat Let me introduce This is Miss Mei Li She is the boss here How are you?

Let go So speak up, where's the other map? What map?

Nobody knows how much treasure there is; How can a price be set? Don't look at me like that We are after all business associates not enemies... Come on, have some wine What exactly do you mean? Speak up I too risked my life ...for that map You'll have to reward me adequately If the treasure is found I want one tenth of it I like you I'm willing to hand over the map to you One tenth is not too much to ask, is it? Are you willing?
