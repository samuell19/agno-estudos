Kill me first, you bastard! - Step off bitch and maybe I'll spare your punk ass. Go on, beat it! - Bastard, you dare have the nerve to insult the Clan of the Wu-Tang?! - Why not? You ain't shit! (both grunting) (arms and feet thudding) (arms whooshing) (Tupac grunting) (arms thudding) (both grunting) (Tupac punching and grunting) (ominous music) (Tupac laughing maniacally) - (winces) No! No!

I've come from China seekin' wisdom, lookin' for some power and the nearest (mumbles) hospital. - Buddha bless you. Welcome to our temple. Do you care to play a game of Chinese Chess? Our Game Boy is broke (mumbles) light. - What kind of motherfuckin' shit is this? - Dolemite Clan decide when Tupac was here, but we cast him away. - You did? Oh, well what did you do? - He was (mumbles) all night and fighting all day. - If I'd have been here, I'd have kicked his goddamn ass. So tell me this, which way did that motherfucker go? When I catch him, Imma put these hush puppies up his motherfucking ass. - Buddha bless you. (birds chirping) (ominous music) (ninja mouth calling) (both screaming) - Ninja hitmen? (ninjas grunting) (arms whooshing) - May I suggest that you back off or you'll be hurt? - [Ninja] Stupid gringo, kill him! (kicks thudding) (ninjas grunting) - Come on, let's get out of here! - You're good. - Thank you, my Lord. - Move it along. (bell tolling) - Sir Prince Sanada has foiled the assassination attempt. - (laughs) So the meddlesome fool thought he could meddle in our affair and hide in the Shaolin temple afterwards. We'll show him different. - [Ninjas] Yes, Lordship! - Round up the men and prepare the ships to set sail for China. I want both the Prince and Shaolin temple destroyed. Not a single monk shall be spared a horrible death. I want them crushed! - [Ninjas] Yes, Lordship! (Lord laughing maniacally) (soft, suspenseful music) (bell tolling) (soft guitar music) - Buddha bless you. Arise, my son. - Thank you, High Holiness. - What brings you to Shaolin temple? - Master, I have traveled from Japan to learn the sacred arts of the Shaolin temple. So Master, I would be most honored if you could teach me those arts, so I could spread their knowledge in Japan. - Normally Sir, we don't accept strangers. But another outsider from the Dolemite Clan has been allowed, so you may stay too. - Thank you Abbot, you are most kind. (bell tolling) (soft soothing music) - Excuse me, are you Abbot White? - Yes, I've been expecting you, please sit down. - Thank you, High Abbot. - (sighs) Yes I know that the reason you are here is because of this ninja conspiracy. Is that correct? - Master, I wish to learn Shaolin techniques so that I may defeat them. - The ninjas and Shaolin have been at odds for a great many years. I remember the last time I ran into them, hmm. (dramatic fight music) (blades swooshing) (ninjas shouting) (idol laughing maniacally) - Ninja black magic. (idol laughing maniacally) Buddha have mercy. I demand that you tricksters show yourselves right now. - Silly Abbot, Trix are for kids. Prepare to die, monk. - You have entered the 37th chamber of Shaolin and now because of your actions, you must suffer the consequences. I demand that you show yourselves. Come out! (swords whooshing) (ninjas grunting) (fists thudding) (ninjas grunting) (ninjas shouting) (swords whooshing) (ninja shouting) (shelf crashing) (smoke bomb exploding) - Another attack is inevitable. Your arrival foreshadows that. - Master, I-- - Enough of this. Let's begin your education now. - Thank you sir, I'm ready. - First, I'll show you the five-style fist. Pay attention. - I won't disappoint you, Master. I've been preparing for this chance all my life. - Huh. - Shaolin Kung Fu derives itself from nature's five elements. They're metal, wood, earth, fire, and water. - Dammit, why does he teach a foreigner and not me? - Yes Master, I understand. - Good. Let's begin with the basics. - I'm ready, Master. - Wait, where are you going? - Leave me alone! - You're not allowed to leave, you can't. - Who's gonna stop me? - Well I... I better tell the Abbot what happened. - Right - Abbot White, Sir. - What is it, boy? - It's bad, Sir. It's Chi Kang, he's run away Sir. - That fool! Buddha (mumbles).

(fire crackling) (energetic Asian music) (arms whooshing) (both grunting) - Master, forgive me. - Well now, what do I have here? Well done; you've improved. First, keep practicing and you'll be my best student yet. - Thank you, Master. - (sighs) Still, these strikes alone won't be able to defeat the power of the ninja artists. So you'll have to use your brains to fight them. - Yes Master, I will use both skill and brains. - Very well, keep practicing. - Yes. (wind howling) (ominous music) - (sighs) Buddha, have mercy. A Ninja deadly trap. (ninjas shouting) (swords clanging) (soft Asian music) Buddha bless you.

I saw his body myself. - (claps) Excellent. (Phantasm whooshing) Mr (mumbles), what do you think of my student? Her name is Phantasm. - (laughs) A martial arts masterpiece. - Your wish is my command. - Go kill and return. - Right. (ominous music) - Those beads. Master? - (laughs) I screwed a guy to death so I could get those. - Where did you get those? - Come on over here and I'll whisper it to you. - That'll be a pleasure. (arms whooshing) (both shouting) (Shurikens whooshing) (suspenseful Asian music) (Shurikens whooshing and clanging) (fists smacking) (both grunting) - Those must be Master's beads. Big brother, look at this. Look, here. - Yes, these are Abbot White's beads. Let's tell the Abbot. Come on, we have no time to waste. (soft Asian music) - Prepare the funeral. (rhythmic drumming) (bell tolling) (ominous music) (ninjas shouting) (sword swooshing) - Well well, if it ain't the lost tribe of Shabazz. Don't tell me you white niggas.

(both moaning and wincing) - Oh my goodness. - Thanks ma'am. - It looks like you ran into Tupac of the Dolemite Clan. - That's right. You're damn right. - It was him. We got no beef with the West side. That nigga's got to go. See if I don't cap his ass next time. - He is a sworn enemy of the Wu-Tang tribe. He killed my father and stole the death bell. He plans to unite with the Ninjas and destroy Shaolin. I can't allow this to happen. - Let's join forces. I think it'd be a good idea for both of us. - Right, but first to Shaolin. We must warn the Abbot. (ominous Asian music) - I wonder if those fellers in the pajamas could give me directions to Shaolin. - Where do you think you're going, gringo? What's your name? - Me? Well I'm Davey Crockett. Hunter and tracker at your service. - Vamos now gringo or I'll have to kill you. - I ain't gonna leave on your say so. (sword sheathing) En garde. - Wait. (ominous music) (swords clanging) (both grunting) Let's get outta here! - Don't say I didn't warn ya. - We should have no trouble in destroying the Shaolin temple now that we have Tupac on our side. Viva La Russia. Tupac is indeed a powerful ally for anyone to have and I am sure that we should be victorious. - You said it, G. We're gonna whip their baldheaded asses.

A little sore maybe? - Come on then, come on. - Hey hey hey, calm down. Calm down now. He's only playing around with you. What's your purpose of your coming to Shaolin, huh? - I came to train my skills with some experts, not kids like that. (soft Asian music) - [Everyone] Greetings, Lord Abbot. We hope you are well. - [Abbot] Please be seated. - Abbot, these three? - Ah, well this girl is from the tribe of Wu-Tang. And these men are from the tribe of Shebazz. That's right, these men have come to warn us of an impending ninja attack. Their army is already entrenched in the region. It's just a matter of time before they launch an attack. As you see, we must take precautions. This is of extreme importance for our wealth. - Lady Wutasha, why are you here? - Master, Monk Ru-Dee of the Dolemite Clan and I have been hunting Tupac, the Westside Monk. He killed my father and then stole our Wu-Tang family Dolby Stereo death bell. I must get it back from him before he pawns it off. - Where's Monk Ru-Dee now? - Last I saw, he was looking for Tupac. - Alright then, I want everyone here to split up into small groups. If we are divided, we will then stand a better chance of seeing the first attack quicker. Buddha bless you all. (energetic Asian music) ♫ (Mumbles) one time last night ♫ Everybody tell me I did I don't know. I'm wounded, (mumbles) here fight? Boy, I'm in shape. I'm in shape for a fight.
