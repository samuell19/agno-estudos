Chris. Chris! I know. Move it! -You're going to be late. -I'm never late. -I hope you get a time out. -I hope you get cooties. Mom! Be careful on that bike. You don't need another ticket. Slow down. Chris, don't speed. Don't worry. There's no need. Mr. Torres. Mr. Torres? Chris! Sorry. You said if we finished early, we could take a rest. Yeah, you were about to snore the ceiling tiles out. Sorry, Miss Santoro, but the differential equations really took it out of me. Look, the math may come easy to you, Mr. Torres, but respect for the class is still part of your grade. Sorry, gotta get to practice. -Think you'll make captain? -I hope not. I just wanna wrestle. That's where I do my best work. I'd have to agree with that. Smooth move, Romeo. I'd be jealous, but I've gotten used to being the second love of your life. What do you think? You're the best and everyone knows it. Just as long as you know it. Practice in five if you can make it. You heard him, Romeo. Better get a move on if you wanna stay in Kelvin's good graces. -Hey, he needs me. -Lucky him. -See you after practice? -Nah, I gotta fly. Okay, well then I'll see you tomorrow, Romeo. Hey, that's what I'm talking about. Well, well. Torres! Gracing us with your presence this year? What? Coach, you know my moves are the only thing keeping the fans awake out there, right? Only because they want to be watching when you eat mat. We've got a small team this year, some newbies. I need you to step up, set an example. Think you're up to that? Easy to do when all eyes are on me, Coach. Is that a yes? -Sure. -Good. Circle up. Take a knee. Listen up. Welcome to First Flight Wrestling. Here's the thing, we're a really small team this year, so everybody is going to be a starter, even the new guys. But if you're serious and you practice hard, we can form up and have a great year. -That's right, Coach. -Yes, sir. We're counting on each other. So focus, learn from each other, work together. From what I've seen so far, the Nighthawks have a good chance to make a run for the Team State Championship, so let's get it done. - Yes, Coach. - All right. Now, captains this year are going to be our returning seniors, Zelinski and Torres. Torres just got out of cross country, so he's gonna lead running. Zelinski, I want you to lead warmups on the mat. Got it. Good news is we've got a heavyweight this year. Zachary, you're a rare breed out here, kid. We're also honored to have our first female wrestler on the team, Carla. Not only is she good, but she is just like every other wrestler on this team. You will treat her with respect. If you can't handle that, get your jumped-up macho crap outta my gym, and off of my team, you understand? - Yes, Coach. - No problem, Coach. Good. Let's get warmed up. Run first, then practice. Chris, I want you to take them to the monument and back. Okay? Keep it brisk, stay together. This is day one of our championship season. - Let's go! - Yes, Coach. Coach, can I talk to you for a second? What is it, Torres? You're supposed to be leading the run. I didn't want to be team Captain. I didn't wanna be so dang handsome, but here we are. -Yeah, but-- -Look, I asked you if you wanted to step up and set an example. You said yes. Yeah, I wanna do more with wrestling. -I didn't want to babysit. -Babysit? You think what I'm doing up here is babysitting? You think I'm up here, what, wiping backsides, kissing boo-boos? I coach a team. A team needs captains. You've been talking Navy since you wandered through my door. You think you're gonna make it with fancy moves and a pretty boy smile? Hell no. You gotta work for it. You gotta show for it. Most important, you gotta prove it. Do you think you can prove it, Torres? Do you actually think I have a pretty smile? Son, you better start jogging. Kid, you ain't paying me to listen to you whine. -I'm your flight instructor, not your therapist. -Sorry, Paul. I don't want to hear you apologizing either. Sitting over here sounding like a living, breathing country song. -Which one's Marcus? -What? Your problem of the week, Marcus. Which one is he? We've been rivals since freshman year. He's bigger than I am, meaner. He calls himself The Red Menace. That's stupid. You can't give yourself a nickname. Has to be given to you. You think if I had any choice about it, -I'd be call sign Digger? -Why were you called Digger? Eh, I was constantly on report during training. Had me digging ditches all the time. Had my head in the ground so often they started calling me Digger. -Sounds awful. -Better than Blockhead. There's a Blockhead? How'd he get that name? 'Cause he asked a lot of stupid questions. Get it, kid? You don't get that kind of name by being the smartest kid on the block. Looks like your hour's up. What say we shoot the canals on the way back to the airport, huh? -I'm game if you are. -Yippee ki-yay, my friend. So what is a team captain anyway? It's a babysitting position. Why do they need a babysitter at school? Not at school, at practice and matches. Someone has to show them how to do it right. -And they picked you? -And you pick your nose. I'm telling Mom. You're telling Mom that you pick your nose? Mom, Chris just said that I was going to tell you that I pick my nose. -And you just did. -That's not funny. Oh, man. So congratulations on making team captain. Everyone keeps saying that. I learned this cool new Russian move. I just wanna wrestle. You'll have plenty of time to do that. A little responsibility never hurt anybody. And I'm sure it had something to do with this. "Dear Chris Torres, We have received your application to the US Naval Academy. The following items are complete: transcript to include the chemistry, physics, and calculus, standardized test scores..." Those are easier to get when you're not sleeping through class. "...Two letters of recommendation," blah, blah, blah. "The following items need to be complete: Congressional Nomination." Have you sent your request to Senator Williams? - Mailed it. - Good. Now come inside and get a shower. -It's almost time for dinner. -Already ate. Torres, come here a second. Got a call today from Coach Givens up in Annapolis. Looks like they got your application. He wanted to know what kind of wrestler you are. You tell him I was the best you ever trained? Told him the truth, Torres. You're state championship material. He liked that. Said almost all of his kids are state champs. -Admissions likes it. -Then they're gonna love me. Man, there you go again. Standing here just kissing your own backside. Why aren't you working with the rest of the team? You're a captain. 'Cause I handle the runs and Marcus has them in here. I would hate to have to show him up. Believing in yourself is fine, but you've got to start being a team player. No one is the full package. Coach Givens gave me the news. He did a pre-read with admissions. -You didn't get in. -What? He didn't give me any specifics, but they kicked it back to him for final say so. According to him, there's only one way in. You've got to win that state championship. That's not fair. Well, their game, their rules on what is fair. You win or you don't. You step up or you sit down. Now what the hell are you gonna do about it? I'm gonna win the state championship. That's what I like to hear. And a good team will get you there. So, why don't you take them out for a run, captain? All right, Nighthawks, let's take a trip to Wilbur and Orville, let's go. Whoo! You know, when I signed up for this, I didn't think there'd be this much running. It's good for you, Jolly G. Helps to build up your stamina. Yeah, but we don't run around on the mat. You need a good stamina to hold your own on the mat. What do you intend to do to your opponent, fall on him until he gives up? Something like that. When I was in football, Coach told me to do the same thing. All he wanted me to do is fall on people. -You're on the football team? -No, I quit. Too much running. What did you think we were gonna do, Tons-of-Fun? Run around in glitter capes and throw chairs at people? This is real wrestling. Let's go! I don't think he likes me that much. He's a senior. They don't like anybody. Let's go. Pick it up, let's go. Come on. Pick it up, nature boy. Let's go! -Is that necessary? -It's motivation. If he doesn't like it, he'll work harder to not hear it. -Or he'll quit. -Win-win. All right, you loads, take five to catch your breath. Last one down gets to carry Slackary. That is if it's all right with you, El Capitan. What do you want, Marcus? You really didn't hear any of that? How do you run so fast with your head crammed between your legs? -What's your problem? -My problem? We're supposed to be team captains. You think this is some type of solo act. You think you're too good to even run up the monument with your team. Yeah, you gonna call me a stupid name to motivate me, too? They're not stupid names if they're true, Showboat. Break's over. We're going back down. Let's go. Don't worry, I'll keep them in line while you go cry up front by yourself. -Knock it off, you two. -Give me a break. Let's go, Nighthawks. -Oh, man. -Come on, you got it. Good hard run, gotta make sure we cool down. You two can't even go on a run together without giving me grief? Hey, what are y'all doing? Focus, finish your workout. You guys are supposed to be my captains, my leaders. -Not the main event. -He started it. Oh, spare me, Marcus. You two have been butting heads ever since year one. I know the story. I don't care. Here's my problem. How are we supposed to get to states with you two clipping each other's knees before we even have a chance to stand? Problem is you're too stubborn. Too full of yourselves to even think about anyone else. I believe I just formed a plan to get you off each other's backsides. It's quite simple. You guys have extra energy to put on each other. We'll just put it on somebody else. Welcome to the First Flight Nighthawks mentorship program. What? In addition to being team captains, you're going to personally mentor some of our newest members. Marcus, you got Zachary. There's a lot of potential there. Chris, you'd be a good match for Carla. -What? -You've got to be joking. Zelinski, the only joke out here is you two. So full of yourselves, you don't have time for anything else. I just gave you a way out of that. -You're welcome. -Come on. Stow it, Torres. Or does the state championship mean that little to you? That's what I thought. Congratulations, gentlemen, you're gonna be shaping the next generation of Nighthawks. Let's go give them the good news. -You, a mentor? -I know, right? -What is Coach thinking? -Right? I mean-- hey. It's bad enough he made you team captain. Wow, you really know how to build up a guy. I'm not trying to build you up, Romeo. Coach knows what he's doing. The Navy wants leadership and that's what he is giving you. So put on your big-boy pants and get in the game. -Yes, ma'am. -That's what I like to hear. So, what's the Navy telling you anyways? I'm in a holding pattern until the state championship thing works itself out. Seriously, you should consider Army if this whole Navy thing doesn't work out. Not an option. You don't know that. Navy's not doing you any favors. I'm not talking about this with you. Well, maybe I wanna talk about it with you. Maybe we should talk about your swimming instead. Crafty diversion, but I accept. You're not the only team captain inspiring the troops. Coach Bradshaw is over the moon with my backstroke. Next meet is Tuesday. Think you can come by and see it? -I can't, I got to practice. -Imagine that. -You always have practice. -Practice makes perfect. You're right, practice does make perfect. Check please. We're heading out. Chris and Marcus, let's go, lead the way. Clear the mat. Ladies and gentlemen, and here are your First Flight Nighthawks. Hey. -Hi, Mrs. Torres. What's up, Mike? -Hi, Lisa. First match of the season. Think they're ready? To hear Chris tell it, he could take on the whole team himself. -I see Jack is back again. -Of course. It's what he was born to do. The Creefs only make wrestling champs. Who's that young lady out there? That's Carla. Chris is mentoring her. Chris didn't tell you? Oh, yeah. To keep him and Marcus busy, Coach is making them mentor. Carla's stuck with Chris. -Poor girl. -Poor Coach. I hope he knows what he's doing. One Chris is more than enough. Michael, put that thing away. We're here to watch your brother wrestle. Let me know when he's losing. All right guys, bring it in. All right, good energy, I like it. Ready, Jeff? Chris, start this off right. Don't do anything fancy. Get it done quick and easy. Relax, Coach. I'm here to do some serious work. Good, that's what I want to hear. Oh, boy, here we go. Boo! Unsportsmanlike conduct, green. One team point deduction, green. Come on, ref. Let the kids wrestle. He's just excited. Coach, get control of your wrestler. Another unsportsmanlike conduct against him and I'm gonna disqualify him. That's a fine start to the season. -You're kidding me. -Cut the crap, Chris. Get out there and get to work. I even brought my tools, sledge and hammer. You know the Kortezki V2? Gentlemen, shake hands. Ready? Two green, take down. Now you do. Gentlemen, shake hands, please. Nice match. Winner by fall. Marcus, you're up. Marcus. Good! Fall! Jack, TLT, TLT. Jerk him! Fall! Come on, Zach. Come on, Zach. You got it. Two red, takedown. Must be a nighttime run to the bombing range. I haven't worked up to night flying yet. -Paul thinks I'm ready though. -I'm not surprised. You're a natural, just like your father. You know, he was so good that he used to do things just to freak out his instructors. -Like what? -Tell her about the Coke can, Mom. Well, once he learned to land, you know, touch down and take off again like on an aircraft carrier, he used to hit the exact same spot every time. He got so good that they used to put a Coke can on the runway. He would hit it on landing, and then climb right back up again. It was very impressive. His instructors weren't too amused though. Probably because he got Coke all over the runway. Probably so. Well there was this other time at Uncle Carl's wedding. Nobody could find your father anywhere, but the priest insisted that we go on with the ceremony. As soon as he said, "Now I pronounce you husband and wife," your father did this low altitude, low speed flyover. It scared the crap out of everyone. The windows shook. The caterers dropped trays of food. Even one of the groomsmen jumped in the bushes. The priest was in on it the whole time. Well, oddly enough, we weren't invited to too many more weddings. I wish I had the chance to meet him. He would've liked you a lot. Don't worry though. -I'm gonna be just like him. -Me, too. "Abandon all hope, ye who enter here." Not gonna be a problem. Undefeated, baby. -Who's gonna stop me? -This is Kid Hulk's home turf. You didn't wrestle him last year, I did. He pinned me in the first. Yeah, well, you'll get him this time. - I hope you're right. - Listen up. Now, we've won some matches. We've scored some points. But this is going to be tough. You go in there strong, you go in there smart. -You got me? -Yes, Coach. Sweet Sookie. You go in there with that kind of energy, we might as well just forfeit and offer to wash their jocks. Did I pick up the First Flight quilting squad by mistake? I said we wrestle strong and smart! - You got me? - Yes, Coach! Good. I was starting to think I drove all this way for nothing. Now let's go get it done, Nighthawks! Hustle up. We gotta talk. You've got some big competition today. -Name's Eric Sutter. -Kid Hulk? -Yeah, I know him. -Oh, fitting name. He went to states last year and won. He's top dog in these parts. Wrestled Jack last year and pinned him in the first. -Not this year. -Yeah, that's right. I found out this morning Sutter upped his weight. He's in a completely different division. -Your division. -Lucky him. You've had it easy so far, Torres, but this kid is the real deal. He's as fast as he is strong. Do not play around with this guy. Relax, Coach. This is not my first rodeo. I got this. He's new to my weight class. I have the advantage. Just trying to help. Mmm. Your mission, should you choose to accept it. That's Kid Hulk? I was expecting something greener. That's 'cause he's in a good mood. Okay, Torres, you're up. Move quick and counter. Keep it simple. Don't get flashy. Watch out, Hulk smash. Well, I'm Kid Kryptonite. That's not how that works. All right, gentlemen, shake hands. Two, takedown, two! Just like last year, huh? Shake hands. What just happened? Well, I'll tell you what I saw. Some cocky little chucklehead didn't listen to his coach and got his butt whooped. What did it look like from where you were? This guy's a monster. They don't call him Kid Hulk for his vocabulary. You want to be a state champion, you're gonna have to go through him. Through him? How am I gonna do that? Whoa, what's that, Torres? You're asking someone for help? I thought you were a solo act. I've gotta mark this one down on my calendar. You've had it easy so far, Torres, but this kid is the real deal. Whoa, what's that, Torres? You're asking someone for help? You want to be a state champion, you're gonna have to go through him. Uh, Marcus, there's a problem. What do you want, Slack? -I have a match. -So? So, you're my mentor. What do I do? Just don't get pinned. -Yo, what's up? -What's up? Yo, you guys got a girl in my weight? Sounds like she's making you nervous, Damian. Nah man, look, I break the lady's hearts, not their arms. I don't want to hurt her. Tell her to pin herself in the first 20 seconds, or I'm gonna banana split her. Carla hates being called a lady. She's gonna hate being embarrassed in front of her team more. I'm just trying to warn her. It's only fair. Why don't you go tell her yourself? Uh-oh, looks like someone's intimidated. -What you think, Chris? -I believe so. Hey, Damien, is this your first time ever touching a girl? You tell her to eat mat, or she's gonna get hurt. So, you gonna tell her? -What's up? -What's up? Word is you're going against Damian. So? He wants you to give up the match. Said he only loves ladies and doesn't hurt them. I know, right? He's gonna try to banana split you. If he takes you down, he's gonna put a leg in and attack the other leg. -Thanks. -No problem. Whatever happens, you get taken down, always work to your base, okay? All right. You got it, you bet. -Carla Tillett. -Damian Rodriguez. -Talk to Chris? -Yeah, bad news for you. I ain't no lady. Shake hands, please. Set. Nice match. Shake hands. Winner by fall. You did good. Not good enough. So then Coach Bradshaw told Karen that maybe if she shaved her legs she could get a little bit more speed, and everybody thought that was so funny except for Karen, who's going through this whole natural woman thing and doesn't think she has to conform in order to compete. And then practice turned into this whole lesson about hydrodynamics, and I've never been more bored in my life. And you're not even listening to me. I was. You're talking about aerodynamics. I love aerodynamics. And you're thinking about planes again. Did you even grasp anything of what I was saying? Karen would make a lousy plane. Touché. On to unfinished business. When can I see you at one of my meets? Smooth move, Romeo, but you can't rose your way out of this one. Your meets are always during my personal trainings. And you're always training. Well, I need to be a state champ, and to do that, I gotta be in top condition. You ever think you got the wrong focus, Chris? It's like everything is rigged against you from the beginning. They want the best. Maybe you should consider switching sides. Swimming is a Navy skill, after all. My dad and my uncles and my brothers would kill me. Not with the SEALs at your back. My uncles are Rangers. I'm sensing a competition coming along. -Push up contest? -What are the stakes? Hmm, a kiss. Ooh, nice one, Romeo. Okay, and if I win, you have to come to my next meet. Hey, wait a minute. All I'm getting is a kiss? Too late, I already accepted. First one to 20, Romeo. You better wave a flag when you get there. That's not fair. That's the rallying cry of a loser. You're ten behind. Hey, Mikey, I got a pushup contest going on with your brother. If you help me win, I'll give you a dollar. Hey, what the heck? Good match. My next meet is Tuesday at 7:00. Don't forget to bring your flag. -You cheated. -I called for reinforcements. That's standard procedure if you wanna secure the win. But to show you I'm such a good sport, I'll give you your prize for free. -Ahem. -Wow, some backup. You get what you pay for. Jeff, basic arm drag. Okay, wrist and tricep, shift. Got it? All right. Dang, sack of potatoes. You got moves like a brick wall. Maybe you should be on the other team and put that losing to good use. Hey, now, take it easy. I said take it easy. Go, take a run. Why don't you run this clown? If he wasn't the only heavyweight on the team, he would've been out weeks ago. What are you staring at? This ain't drama club. Pick it up. Coach, he's right. I shouldn't be here. I lose every match. That's not technically true. You've had three forfeits this year already. That's 18 team points you scored just by trying hard and showing up. Yeah, the benches show up. Yeah, but they don't win us points. Look, kid, this is a tough sport. You've got ways to go yet, but as long as you show up, you've got a chance. Stick with it, train hard, believe in yourself. -Well, that's the hard part. -Well, maybe at first, but after the first time you surprise yourself, you'll be amazed at what you can go on to achieve. Now, back to drilling. Come on. Let's work on stopping those double legs. So when are you taking me up? Paul said I need a few more lessons before he's comfortable letting me risk anyone else's life. -That's encouraging. -That's Paul. What's on your mind, Torres? You're broodier than normal. Marcus was really giving Zach a hard time at practice yesterday. Basically called him useless. I thought he was finally gonna quit, but Coach talked him out of it. Zach's trying to better himself against the odds. That's the kind of guy you want on your team. -Yeah, you're right. -Of course I'm right. I'm always right. You're lucky you get the wisdom for free. If I start paying, can I get less of it? Race you to the pier. Is that as fast as they run in the Army? -Ah. -Proud of yourself? You could say that. Or maybe it was part of my master plan. Master plan? More like petty revenge for losing to me at pushups. Both. Or maybe it's 'cause I want to get you alone for a little bit. Oh, I see. And do you always get what you want? It's worked so far. Just so you know, this isn't an official visit until I see you in the stands at one of my swim meets. Relax okay. I'll be there. I'll believe it when I see it. I'll be there. Wednesday at 8:00? Tuesday at 7:00. -How's Zach coming along? -Well, he's still here. Not for long if Marcus has anything to do with it. I've got bad news, Slack. Looks like you've got a match. You should go out and forfeit so I don't have to hear you hit the mat. How is this helping him? You're supposed to be a team captain. You've done nothing but cut him down the whole season. Believe me, he should have been cut weeks ago. He's useless. He's still here giving his all despite having to put up with you. That has to mean something. Put it in the match, Zelinski. Keep that crap off my sideline. Tell your Showboat to mind his own business. The team is everyone's business. Go warm up, Zelinski. You know what? You're looking for a fight, so you better deliver on that mat or you're gonna be pulling double laps tomorrow. Don't listen to that clown, man. You only lose if you stop trying. You haven't stopped yet, Jolly Green. Carla Tillett. Trent Campos. Shake hands, please. Set. Change. Green takes down. Green, get set. Two, reversal, green. Set red, green cover. One escape red neutral, one red neutral. Shake hands, please. Nice match. Winner by decision. Yeah! Yo, that was awesome! She got her first... Coach, bad news. I got sent to the principal today. -What happened? -Somebody reported me. What about? For bringing King and Kong to school. All right, guys, listen up. On the line. Let's go live. -You ready? -Always. Let's go, dog. -Hey, what are you doing? -Just defending. Keep it legal. -Why are you such a jerk? -You are, too. -Just in a different way. -I don't get it. What's with you? We're on the same team. -We're a lot alike. -We're nothing alike. Your father was some hotshot pilot. My father's in jail. Your mother has everything. My mother can hardly speak English. -You clueless dickhead. -Try and keep up. All right, you guys, cut the crap. That's it for today. Everybody bring it in. -Chris, break it down. -Nighthawks on three. One, two, three, Nighthawks! -You okay? -Yeah, I'm gonna get going. I gotta get to a swim meet. -What did you weigh out? -I dropped like five pounds. Oh, you know better than that. Stay hydrated. Stay focused. I can't believe it. He actually showed up. Oh, my God! Chris, are you okay? I think there's something wrong. Let's get you inside and call your mom. You don't look so good. I'm gonna call your mom. I think I'm gonna be sick. Your mom's on the way. She says she thinks you have a concussion. Looks like you'll do anything to get out of one of my swim meets. Believe me, this wasn't my choice. I know. I was just picking on you. Do you wanna hear some good news? -What? -I heard back from West Point. I got in. Well, at least it's winter break. Everybody could use some time to relax. -I don't got time to relax. -I've noticed. Well, take it easy with Coach Givens today. You're still recovering from that concussion and the doctor said you shouldn't wrestle for two weeks. What if Coach Givens wants to see my skills? You just flash that winning personality you've had since grade school. Just like that. Oh! Kid, I'm convinced you're gonna rule the world one day. Ah, yes. The rising star from First Flight. Coach Kelvin and I have spoken a lot about you. I really appreciate you guys driving up. Have a seat, please. This is a pretty impressive file, Torres. Team Captain, volunteered for the mentor program. -That's good stuff. -Thanks, Coach. Don't thank me. You did all the work, kid. I'm just reading the news. So now you wanna fly jets and wrestle for Uncle Sam. Well, yes, Coach. My father was a pilot. Jet noise is in my blood. And as for wrestling... I just love it. Yeah. That's the confidence Coach Kelvin kept telling me about. And you are gonna need that. Well, everybody's gotta start someplace. -How about right now? -What? Just a friendly competition to see your boy in action. I got a-- I got a couple guys waiting in the combatives room. -Well actually I think that-- -No, no problem. Just, uh, try not to hurt them, okay, Torres? Ma'am, do you have any concerns with this? -No problem, right, Mom? -No problem. I brought my stuff with me. Good man. Get down there and change. We'll see you at the end of the hallway. Come on, guys. Put your shirts on. This ain't Waikiki Beach. Torres, this is Simmons and Ellis. They are back on leave from down range. I think, I never know. This will give us some time to talk, Mrs. Torres. What did you want to talk about? Plan B. -Let's see what you got. -So, you guys are SEALs? Nah, we're just problem solvers. And today, you're our problem. We'll start with takedowns and go from there. -Go Navy. -Beat Army. Wrestle! Time. Time. No, it's you two. We switch out. No, I don't think so. Yeah, I went twice already. It's you two this time. That's not how this works. Coach didn't send us in here to test each other. You guys get a rest and I don't? That's not fair. Fair? What's this fair? Ellis, did you order a warm bottle of fair for this kid? -Not me. -Maybe we should ask his mommy. See if she packed him a bottle of fair in his diaper bag. He doesn't talk much, does he? He just likes to blow things up. -All right. I get it. -Not yet, kid. But you're about to. Wrestle. Time. Time. Time. Hey, high school, if you need to puke, the can's over there. If you puke on the mat, you're gonna eat it. No problem. Hey, I learned this cool move the other day called the Kortezki V2. You guys want me to show it to you? Not gonna show us anything new, high school. Freeze, right there. Not used to this view, are you, high school? You got ten seconds to get out. How bad do you want it? -Oh, yeah, go Navy. -Beat Army. Say goodnight, high school. Looks like you guys are getting along. -Just having some fun, sir. -Yeah, I can see that. I'm glad you showed up, too. One minute later, I would've broken your hand with my face. That was good work, Torres. You got these guys pissed, and that is not an easy thing to do. Look, man, why don't you hit the showers and we'll have a talk with you and your mom in my office, okay? Hey, you guys go back to vacation. Knit a sweater or something. Looks like Annapolis went well. Got my butt kicked. And West Point? Seen it, loved it, bought the t-shirt. You know, swimming's totally a Navy thing. Only if your boat sinks. -So, you got in? -I'm not sure yet. The coach told my mom it was imperative that I win a state championship. It's between that or wrestling two SEALs. I'm beginning to have my doubts. Geez, Chris, that's intense. I thought you weren't supposed to wrestle over break. Coach Givens wanted to see what I had. Was I supposed to tell him no? I guess not. I've never got my butt beat so bad. Those guys were all over me. It wasn't even fair. It's like everything I tried to do was just thrown back in my face. Careful, Romeo, you're starting to sound like me. I'm starting to think you have a point. Wow, listening to me and agreeing with me? Those guys must have hit you harder than you thought. So what are you going to do? I don't know. It's obvious they're not gonna give me any breaks and I can't quit. I guess I just gotta work harder. It is what it is. I know, but if you would only consider West Point-- I don't want to go to West Point, Lisa. I'm Navy, all the way. I'm gonna be a pilot just like my dad. It's Navy or nothing. Well, I got something to cheer you up. Lisa, I'm sorry. It's just all this stress. Don't sweat it. I'm sure the Naval Academy thinks it's all worth it. -Thanks for the help, Mikey. -I didn't do anything. I know. Senator Williams? All right! -Mail call. -Great, Senator Williams? "It gives me great pleasure to inform you... ...your credentials are outstanding, and you have a great potential for leadership. I am submitting your name for nomination for an appointment to the US Military Academy at West Point. I am submitting your name for nomination for an appointment to the US Military Academy at West Point." Is this a joke? No, honey, you read the letter. It says what it says. Well, at least you'll know somebody when you get there. We'll figure it out, all right? Okay, I'll talk to you later. Bye. So, is it a mistake? I spoke with the senator's office. They said it's not a clerical error and there's nothing that they can do. They only have a number of nominations and they've all been given out. She can't switch yours without taking away someone else's, which they won't do. -I can't believe this. -I know. They said receiving a nomination is a great honor and we should be happy. Of course, we're happy, but... they also said they understand our situation and are sorry about the mix-up. -What are we gonna do? -I don't know, honey. Learn to fly a tank. Oh! For what it's worth, I think you would look good in green. You know, I was talking to my dad, and you can fly in the Army, too. Just stop. I'm just trying to help, Chris. Well, it's not working. So we're just gonna sit out here in the cold so you can sulk? What happened to that go-get-em, best-of-the-best attitude of yours? -It went to West Point. -And is that so bad really? You can still fly in the Army, Chris. They have a wrestling program. You can do everything you wanted to do in the Navy. Sure, West Point isn't where you wanted to be, but maybe it's where you belong. I belong to the Navy. I wanna fly just like my dad did. Why can't I have that? You can't be just like him, Chris. You have to be you. It's not as bad as you're making it out to be. Well, of course, it's not for you. The Navy was my whole future and it's gone. I get to go to West Point with you just like you wanted. So it's my fault now? West Point is fantastic. It's an honor just to be nominated. But here you are, screaming and crying, and throwing sand like a baby. I get you're upset. But what I don't get is this spoiled, self-centered attitude of yours. You think the whole world revolves around you? And mostly, I don't get why I'm standing out here trying to give a crap about someone who obviously doesn't give one about anyone else. Goodbye, Chris. Oh, so now you're gonna break up with me? The way I see it, between you, your misery and your jets, there's just no room for me anymore. It's all or nothing with me, Romeo. See you in the clouds. Aaah! Why don't you save some weight, for the rest of us, Showboat? Now's not the time, Marcus. Oh, yeah? My bad. I didn't know it was Torres time. Guess you've had the area rented out for a week, huh? Is there a problem, boys? Oh, no problems, Coach. Just waiting for my turn on the weights. Torres, that's enough iron. Get off and help Creef with demonstrations. Thanks, man. I gotta get in shape. Word is captain of the swim team is single. I have to make a good impression. Relax, Showboat. I'll show her a good time. Just go do something besides jogging and have her cheer for me in the stands. -You stay away from her. -Or what? You don't need her anyway. All you care about is jets. You don't know when to quit, do you, Marcus? No one ever won by quitting. Now why don't you go walk away like a good boy so no one gets hurt? You two, knock it off, right now! -I'm not walking away this time. -Good. Let's see what you're made of. Hey, hey! - Stay out of this, Meatloaf! Knock it off right now, Marcus. I've had it with you two! - Come on, Showboat, final round. Well, you two finally went for it, didn't you? I hope it was really worth it. Suspended? But that's ridiculous. He was defending himself. Well, what else should he have done when a thug starts a fight with him in front of the whole team? No, no, I get it. Rules are rules. Even if they are set up to punish those who defend themselves. Yeah, fine. Thank you. What makes you think I want to hear any of this? One of the best parts about not being in high school is not having to hear about high school. -Sorry, I-- -Kid, if I hear another "Sorry," I'm gonna nose dive us into the sound. You pulled a grade A snafu with your high school career. That sucks. Spare me the details. Only reason why I'm up here is 'cause I told my mom I already paid for the lesson. You did pay for the lesson, right? That better be a yes. What you got planned for a follow-up act? A little anarchy, some fire bombing? Well, I've never crashed a plane. I've never kicked a kid out at 2,000 feet. Could be a year of firsts for both of us. I just had to be up here. It's easier up here, like I'm above it all. You are, and you're drifting, so keep it steady. I mean... you know what I mean. I know what you mean, kid. Flying is-- it's like setting your soul free. Pulls you up out of the muck, and shows you the whole picture. All the dreary stuff gets real small when you leave it on the ground. You can even go so far you can't even see it anymore. You wanna know the real trick to flying, Chris? -What's that? -Gotta come down sometime. When you do, you gotta be ready for it. Whoo! -Yes, who are you? -Hi, I'm Chris Torres. -I'm here to see Marcus. -Okay, hold on just a second. Marcus. Who is it? Torres? Where are you from, Torres? My grandmother was a Shawnee Indian. That's cool. Marcus. Okay. What are you doing at my house? You come for a round two? No thanks, man. I'm still paying for the last one. You're lucky Coach got me off of you when he did, or else you'd be eating soup for the rest of your life. What's this about? -Man, we gotta talk. -Talk? You wanna talk? You got suspended for a week. I, I got expelled. I don't have anything to say to you, man, except get the hell out. Look, man, I'm sorry. I was being stupid, but I didn't set out to ruin our lives. Aw, you're making me weepy, Showboat. I sure do feel bad for you. Why don't you go hop on that little bike of yours and go ride out your blues? Me, I've gotta go get ready for work. I've got a long life of washing dishes ahead of me. You were right. I had my head up my butt for so long that I lost sight of everything that mattered, and lost everything that mattered. Wah-wah. Go tell someone who gives a crap. You're just as bad as I am. We gotta fix this. We've gotta let go of each other's throats, and work together. Work together for what? What do we possibly need to work on? Getting you back in the school, for one. Look man, I think you're king jerk, but I don't think what they did to you was fair. That's what you want, huh? Showboat rides in on his bike to save the day. You want more for your life than washing dishes. You know that. You think I'm playing? Answer me one question. What am I getting out of this? So, can we talk? -I hate cherry. -See, I didn't know that. We're off to a great start. You have to understand my hands are tied here. The two of you engaged in a fight, which makes this a legal matter. Yeah, it was stupid of us, but we made a mistake. But we learned from this. Do you know how many times I've heard that before? Look, I'm not here to judge your sincerity. The fact of the matter is, the two of you engaged in a fight on school grounds, which makes that against the law. And you. You started this fight so you get the worst punishment. It's bad enough that I've got all this paperwork that I have to deal with because of this altercation. Now, I've got the school board questioning whether we need safer weight stations. Safe weight stations? Don't ask. Look, guys, I have rules that I have to follow. Those rules are in place for a reason. Yeah, but we talked it out and we're fine now. Well, good for you. The two of you can go hang out at the skate park or whatever it is that you do. Obviously, you two have worked out your problems 'cause you're sitting here trying to do the right thing. I see you, but I just can't change policy on your word. Coach, what have you got to say about this? I'm gonna be honest here. These two have butted heads since I've known them. I'm surprised it took them this long to throw down. Whatever beef they had, these two have worked it out and they're trying to move forward. And Ms. Pittman, if that's not what we're trying to teach and encourage out here, then what are we doing? All right team, listen up. I've got some news. I want you to hear it from me before you hear it in the halls. Philips... Uh... Zachary... tried to commit suicide last night. Is he, uh... is he okay? He was in the hospital, Creef. But I understand he's home now. I don't have a lot of details. Philips was a part of our team. Though he didn't always get a fair shake from us. He might have quit us, but we are not going to quit him. I fully support and encourage any member of the team who wants to go and check up on him. I think we owe it to him, don't you? We're gonna go, Coach. We'll go right now. Let's go. Hello? May I help you? Hi, we were wondering if we can visit with Zach? Sure, come on in. He's resting out back. -Hey, Zach. -Hey. What are you guys doing here? -Oh, God, Zach, are you okay? -Yeah, I'm okay. Been better, but definitely been worse. Good. Now what the heck is wrong with you? Carla. Not now. It's okay. I'm sorry, Carla. I-- I kind of got lost in my own head. I was scared and I didn't really think it through. I didn't think at all. I'm kind of surprised you guys are here. I-- I quit. Well, the team didn't quit on you, man. I've been through this a couple times, so I'll just get right to it. It was pills. I had to get my stomach pumped, which I do not recommend, but I won't be doing this again either. But I'm gonna be seeing a shrink for a little while, but she's cool. Um, it was her idea to actually come out and relax and meditate outside more, which I think she's right about. Why'd you do it, man? Are you asking if it was 'cause of you? I mean, you didn't help. You were just saying all those things I was already telling myself every day. And believe me, I'm a lot meaner than you could ever be. I-- I joined wrestling 'cause I wanted to prove those voices wrong. I wanted to be bigger and stronger than I was on the inside. Like Randy Savage or Andre the Giant. You know, those guys were my heroes. They're unstoppable. They're larger than life. But I'm not those guys, I'm just me. Which, that's okay. Look, man, I'm sorry. - It's okay. - It's not okay. You know, you reminded me of myself before I joined the team and in order for me to get into the right mindset, I had to Stone Cold myself, and I thought that's what you needed, but I guess I was wrong. Look man, I know I was a pain in the ass, but I've been figuring out a lot lately. When you want to come back, we'll set things right. Eyes right, Nighthawks. This is where we make it or break it. All right, listen up. We've had a hell of a road to get here, but now we've made it and we're gonna make some noise! You're with me? We're not the biggest team, but nobody is judging us on that. They judge us by the fight we bring. So for us to come out on top, all of you are going to have to win and keep winning. Each and every one of you are champions. You know it, I know it. Now let's go bring them the news! Let's get it done! Denton is no joke. You've gotta bring it. How do you feel? -Nervous, Coach. -Chris Torres nervous? I never thought I'd live to see that day. I've come so far. I've gotta win. -I can't mess it up. -Then don't. And you're right, you have come a long way because you know what you're doing. You're in control out there. So keep it simple. Nothing flashy. Okay. Hey, Mrs. Torres. This is gonna be great. I hope so. I'm so nervous for the kids. Don't worry. We qualified six wrestlers. We got a shot at a championship. They just have to keep winning and racking up team points. Are you going to wrestle? Didn't qualify, but I'm sticking with it. -Next year's my year. -Good for you. Look, here we go. All right, Chris, you got this. Come on, Chris! Whoo, go! Down, down. Down. There it is. Keep your head up. We had two, takedown, red. Two, near fall, red. Two, reversal, green. Three, near fall, green. End of period. How's it going? -What'd I miss? -Less than a minute to go. Keeps this guy down, he wins. He's got this. Bottom man, set. - Come on, Chris. Top man, on. Blood time, red. You're doing great. All right, keep it simple. Keep him down. -Nothing fancy. -Where's the fun in that? Bottom man, set. Top man, on. Blood time, red. Go see your coach. Bottom man, set. Top man, on. Way to go, Chris! He's not half bad when he's not trying to show off. Keeps up with this, you'll have to stop calling him Showboat. No, I have to remind him where he came from. Way to go, Chris, solid. Good job. All right, come on, Marcus. Keep your head up. Don't lose balance, come on! All right, good, Marcus. Smarter and faster, Jack. You got this. All right, come on, Jack. Keep it up, that's the position. Yes, go, go! All right, Nighthawks, listen up. Welcome to day two of the state championships. I have the standings after the first day of competition. Adding up the points, we are in second place going in to today! All right, we may not be the biggest, but we are definitely giving them a run for the best. Now you go out there, and you show 'em what the Nighthawks are made of. All right, let's go, come on! Let's win it! We got this! That's Carmack. He's a long, lean, wrestling machine. He's precise and he makes no mistakes. So you go in there, and you go in there aggressive from the start. Keep him guessing. -Let's go, Chris. -Come on, Chris. Wrestlers ready? Shake hands. Two, takedown, red. One, escape, green. Two, takedown, green. One, escape, red. All right, Torres. Let's get a takedown. Not the Kortezki, Torres! No, no, no, no, no! No! Chris can't lose. Yes! I told you not to do that move. Why... -What just happened? -He lost. That was his last chance to get into Navy. I'm gonna go try to find him. Jack, will you keep an eye on Michael, please? -Sure thing, Mrs. Torres. -He lost? He can't lose. He's not supposed to lose. -I don't wanna talk. -Neither do I. How about I just sit here beside you, if that's okay? I know this has been a hard year on you, and this-- this isn't what you've been working for. Yeah, no one sets out to be a loser. You're not a loser, Chris. You're here in the arena making things happen. I don't know anyone who has worked as hard for something they've wanted. Well, my path stops here. It's over. Nothing is over until you give up. You have been so focused on this state championship that you don't even realize what you've actually achieved. You may not see it, but I do. At the beginning of the season, the coach made you team captain. You didn't want it, but now, at all of the matches, who's running up and down the line cheering everyone on and giving advice? You used to sit off to the side until it was your time to shine, and now you're right in the thick of it. Yeah, it's a lot more fun than I thought would be. Which makes it even more impressive. You have persisted despite all the crap that's been thrown at you. West Point, breaking up with Lisa, getting suspended. And to top it all off, you and Marcus are thick as thieves. I mean, you've been at each other's throats since freshman year. -How does that even happen? -Not with cherry soda. I don't know what that means, but what I do know is that you've got one more match to win. Your solo shot may be done, but your team needs you, Chris. Your team. They're counting on you, depending on you. With you, they can win. State champion is just a title. They give it out every year. Real champions, they earn the rank. They set an example, a standard, and he beats all the odds no matter what the cost. You ready to go kick some ass, kid? All right, you two, pity party's over. You've still got a shot at third place and it's an old friend of yours, Eric Sutter. You've got 45 minutes. So get ready. Kid Hulk. Kid Hulk? Is that what he calls himself? If he wants to be Kid Hulk, then you go in there bigger, better, stronger and louder. You go in there like a-- like a rock-and-roll Godzilla. I love rock and roll. It's your time, Torres. You've wrestled Sutter before, so you know what to expect. Learn from it. He can be beat and you're going to do it. We're gonna do it, Coach. He stands in our way. Hell yeah, this one's for the team. Now, bring it. It's time to rock and roll, Coach. Hell yeah, kid. That's what I like to hear. We're in second place. If Chris wins, we lock up first. Hey, you got this, dog. Shake hands. Two, takedown, green. One, escape, red, neutral. Okay, Chris, you got this. Let's go, Chris! Top man, on. You got this. Let's go! All right, Chris, you got this. Two, reversal, green. One, escape, red. Two, takedown, green. Keep your head up. Fight for position. End of second period. Blood time, red. Set the clock. He's too quick. I can't get wrist control. All right, I'm not gonna blow sunshine up your ass. All right, you're losing and it's the final period. Strategy is out, right? Listen, Torres, one of you is going to win. -How bad do you want it? -I'm not gonna quit. I have a plan B. If you pull out the Kortezki V2-- Signature move is signature weakness. He's coming at me hard. I'm gonna sucker him in, when he's charging, I'm gonna roll back and I'll end up a top. Lateral drop, I love it. - Come on, Chris! - Let's go, Chris! Wrestle smart. Fight for position. Get off your knees, Chris! One, two three... four, five. Two takedown, red, holding three. There it is. Yeah! Yes, yes, Chris! -Now that was a plan B. -Congratulations, Torres! We did it! We're state champs! Here. That was amazing. Congratulations. I know you've been waiting all season for this. Nice, Mom. Mm. Thanks, Mom. That was awesome. The way you flip rolled that guy and got on top of him. Like out of a fighting game. Yeah, it's a lot more fun than a game. It's real life. To get into Naval Academy, I have to be a state champ, which I'm not. I need a congressional nomination, which I don't have. You are captain of the state championship team. You're also third in the state, which is amazing. That should count for something. And you're my favorite brother. Thanks. You're mine, too. You two are so cute. So Paul called, said that he had a student back out this Saturday and he's free if you wanna go in for a lesson. That's okay. I'll take the weekend off. I think I've earned it. Yeah, but you're so close to finishing. You might as well. I am, but you're the one saying we're on a budget, Mom. I can't keep putting extra lessons on the credit card. Well, sometimes we can make exceptions with the budget. And it was Paul who called, so maybe he's willing to waive the fee. That doesn't sound right. Are you sure it was Paul? Yes, I'm sure. And I already told him you would go, so go. -Mom, what's going on? -Nothing. Just do what she wants, dude. It's safer that way. Trust me. -Hey Paul, what's going on? -You got a meeting. Oh, Mom said you were gonna give me an extra lesson today. Give? You should have seen right through that, kid. Nine times outta ten, I don't give a crap. You got a meeting. -Um, hello? -It's all right, Maggie. This is Mr. Torres. We have an appointment. -I'm Senator-- -Senator Kayla Williams. -And we do? -Yes. I'm not one for surprises, but Paul insisted otherwise. -And you know Paul? -Oh, of course. We went to high school together. Paul always flies me around the Outer Banks when I make the trip out here. I don't trust anyone else. He says you're coming along as quite the pilot yourself. Yes ma'am, or um, Senator Williams. Ma'am is fine. I understand you know your local history as well. Care to give me a tour? -Um, sure. -Okay. This is the VF-17 Jolly Roger. One of the greatest Naval fighter squadrons in history. And this guy right here... Ray Beacham, the Kitty Hawk Kid. He was raised by his grandma in Kitty Hawk. And after a mission he would return home and buzz by her house just to let her know that he was okay. I'm sure that about gave her a heart attack. No, she loved it, and that way she always knew that he was home safe. Ah, affairs of state wait for no one. Um, I'm due down in Hatteras to address the recent flooding. So let's get down to business, shall we? I understand there was a mix-up in my office with a nomination for West Point. -Yes ma'am. -Well, I am sorry. We do our best, but even we make mistakes every now and again. How is your senior year going? My grades are solid, straight A's, and my high school wrestling team just won the state championship. I recall hearing something about that. You were team captain, yes? That seems like it was quite challenging. Yes, ma'am. It was a bumpy ride, but I sorted it out. Mm. Any position of leadership is a bit of a rollercoaster. Any words of wisdom from your experience? Once I learned to put the team before myself, captain was just a title. They're my team. We're all different, but we're all in it together. Yes. So why do you want to go to the Naval Academy, Chris? I used to think it was because I wanted to be like my father, but that's something a kid would say. I want to go to the Naval Academy because that's something I want to do. I believe I have a lot to offer, and the Navy is where I'm best suited to do it. Are you sure? Sounds like you should go into politics. You'd have my vote. -Senator Williams. -Yes, Maggie, I'm on my way. I'm sorry about that. Hatteras is anxious to know what we're gonna do about their roads. Um, I have a free day tomorrow, so I should be able to look into this matter for you. -Would that be all right? -Yes, ma'am. It was a pleasure to meet you, Chris Torres. You as well, Senator Williams. -How'd it go? -Thanks, Paul. Call me, Digger. Hello, everyone. Thanks for coming, everybody. I wanna say I'm sorry that it took nearly three weeks to put this dinner together, but championship rings don't grow on trees. We had a dynamic year, and I want to thank all of you for that. Each of you brought something to this team that we needed. And we wouldn't have gotten here without you. So I have some awards to hand out. But first, we'll hand out the rings. Now, we're gonna do this alphabetically, so everyone bear with me. All right, man. It's your turn. Look at that beauty. Congratulations. Look at that monster. Congratulations. There it is. Congratulations. Congratulations. Good job, man. Okay, everybody, and now for our two graduating seniors. Marcus Zelinski. I have worked with you for four years of Nighthawks wrestling, and Marcus, I can honestly say I've never seen you achieve more on or off the mat than you have this year. So come up here and accept this certificate for four years of outstanding wrestling and contribution to a team. Good job, buddy. And our other graduating senior, Chris Torres. Chris also gave us four years of dynamic Nighthawks wrestling. Oh, boy, there is so much more I could say about that. However, it is my honor to turn over this part of the ceremony to retired Marine Corps Colonel Hank Mills, the Navy Blue & Gold Officer for Eastern North Carolina. Thank you, Coach Kelvin. Coach here has been kind enough to allow me the privilege to present this certificate for four years of outstanding wrestling, and contribution to the team. It also gives me great pleasure to present this letter to you. "Chris Torres. On behalf of the superintendent, you are hereby offered an appointment to the United States Naval Academy." "If you accept this appointment, you will be issued a permit to report in June of this year, where you will become part of the Brigade of Midshipmen." What do you think, young man? Is this an acceptable offer? Torres, Torres, Torres, Torres! All right, let's get everyone up here for a team photo. Congrats, dog. Couldn't have done it without me. "Arise, fair sun, kill the envious moon." -Nice day for a run. -It is. Beach is empty. Congratulations on your win this weekend. Scored the most points for the team. You heard about that, huh? I might have been in the stands, paying off an old debt. Better late than never, I suppose. Something like that. Congrats to you as well. State champion and heading to Annapolis? I guess your persistence paid off. Eh. Came in third place. The team came in first. We're all state champions. They couldn't have done it without you. I couldn't have done it without them. -When are you getting shipped out? -About three months, you? Same. Got enough time for a race? I think I could squeeze one in. -Pier? -Sure. Okay.
