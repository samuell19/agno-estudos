What is the plan? No plans. Just work. Oh no! Oh man, I tell you. I'm so happy that I got rid of the crazy bitch. I bet you did. Well, I never had a better fuck, but her stupid slipslop was too much for me. Yeah. I hope this cunt gets her stuff off my home until I'm back. Hope you had a better weekend? It was alright. You're talking so much, aren't you? Wait, wait. I-- I love you. Can I pick one banana? Thanks. Hey! Hey, man. How are you? Sure you should be out so late? Hey. I had to get something. Oh, what did you get there? Where are you heading? Me? Oh, I'm just a bit hungry and I wanted to get something to eat really quick. A little bit of snack maybe. - Good luck hunting then. - But wait, wait, wait, wait... What about drinking some beers together in your flat? Because I see always those hot chicks you bring there and... you really have to show me your trick. No. And if you don't mind. Oh, sorry. Thanks. Hey! Where have you been? I was out with a friend. With a friend? Who is it? You don't know her. Listen. I don't want you to meet any girls, okay? These girls only want to screw you. Nathalie is different. Nathalie? Is that her name? So, she's from here? See-- I only want the best for you. These nasty bitches are all the same. She's not. You don't even know her. Oh, that's right. And I won't get to know her because you will stop meeting her, alright? Hey. Nobody loves you like I do. See, I care for you. I try to protect you every single day because you're so special to me. And you know? I thank you for everything. You must be thinking, "Oh my God, why me? What will he do to me?" Hm? Well, there is no God. And no reason. The only God you'll ever meet is me, me, and me. I'm not lying here. I'm gonna bleed you out. You're God doesn't care. And I don't fucking care. No angel's gonna weep for you tonight. What do you want? Oh sorry. Did I-- did I wake you up? No, what is it? Do you have hot chicks here, a visitor? For the last time, what do you want? Okay, listen, I have an important meeting today so I won't be at home and I wanted to ask if you could receive a package for me and I will invite you to some beers then for sure-- No time. I'm gonna leave soon. Okay, that's not cool but I mean, okay-- maybe next time then. It's all then? - Yes. - Okay. Can I bring you something? Sorry, my--my Czech isn't that good anymore. Um... One-- one beer, please. No problem. Sounds good, I'll bring your beer. - Here you go. - Thanks. Yeah? I haven't seen you here before. - It's just my second day here. - Ah, okay. You're hungry? We have soup in our daily menu. What kind of soup? Potato and noodle soup. Noodle soup. Uh, I'll take the noodle soup then. No problem. I'll bring it to you. Here you go. - Thanks. - You need more, let me know. Um, a slice of bread would be good. Of course. Sorry. Here. Thanks. You like the soup? It's delicious. Fine. D-D-D-Do you have some bread... maybe? Of course I have some bread for you. I know that you love that. So? What do we say? Th-Thank you, mom. Come on, I'm just kidding. You don't have to thank me. I thank you for being such a wonderful son. You haven't made soup f-f-for a while. I know. W-w-why now? Um... Because I wanted to do you a favor. I-I'm glad that he's gone. He was not g-good enough f-f-for you. No, he wasn't. And I swear, nobody will ever come between us. And nobody will ever hurt you. I promise. Hey. Sorry? What? Do you speak English? What? English! Do you speak English? Yeah. Oh, okay. Um... Are you here alone? So far. Sandra! Sorry, I have to go back to my friends quick. Are you still here for a while? I guess. Okay perfect! See you in a minute? Oh... Sorry! It's okay. - I pay for the cleaning. - It's okay! You ungrateful son of a bitch! I can't believe it! It's so disappointing! I just bought you this new pair of pants and you dirt them? Get rid of them. Oh. Do I feel something? Huh? Are you enjoying it? Yeah? Mom, no! Mum, no! Oh, God, shit! You scared me. Sorry again about this accident. But when you're already here I can make amends. Stop! Please, don't hurt me. I'm not going to hurt you. I'm going to kill you. Really, really bad. Enough play-play. Prague. A brutal murder announced in Club Starling. A young woman got killed this night with several stabs in her back. Most likely this murder happened on the dance floor but nobody has seen the deed. For clarification of facts, the police needs your help to find the murderer. The hotline is 420 974 85-- "Needs your help." "Needs your help." Oh, what a night. Oh, do I feel something? Huh? Are you enjoying it? Yeah? - You like that? - No, mom. I thank you for being such a wonderful son. Thank you for everything. Sorry that you had to wait that long. It's not my day. No problem. - You're good? - Yeah. Thanks. Um, would you like something to drink? Beer, please. Yeah, I'll bring your beer in a second. Wait, would you like to sit down for a minute? You look like you need a break. No, I can't. You know my car broke down today and I had to walk half of my way here. So, I was 30 minutes late and I have no break left. Okay. Beer? Oh! Yeah, I'll bring your beer. Here. Um... I would like to pay now. - Why leave so soon? - Gotta go. Uh, 30 Koruna. It's okay. Oh, thank you. It's not a lot of business today. No. Not really. I think it's worse than the last time. Some of the guys say that some will lose their jobs. We'll see who it will be. Don't get me wrong but it seems like you talk less than before. I mean you have never been the talky one but in the last time you're more quiet than before. Is everything okay? Yeah, everything okay. I mean, it's crazy to ask you that, I don't even know your fucking name. If you like to talk bro, you can talk to every time. Oh no. Please don't come to our place. I knew it. Fucking bitch. It took even longer than the last time. I hope there's no scratch on my expensive car paint this time. God. If I could, I would kill the fucking cunt. I know how you feel. No! What the fuck? Sorry I was there and your front door was not locked and I heard some loud noises and a crack and I don't know. Fuck. Fuck! Fuck! You've been out for quite a while. Where have you been? Uh, I wanted to meet Nathalie but she didn't show up. This bitch, Nathalie, won't hurt you again. What? What have you done? I just took care about that little piece of shit. What have you done? Watch your tongue. One last time! I just ensured that she will never ever get close to you again! And then I buried her in our garden. No! No... No. Hey darling. I will make us some tea and then we can watch some TV? Darling, honey-- Good evening to you, you hot bitch! Oh, I know some nice things we could do with that finger, baby. Here, sit down. Thanks. Um... Do you like something to drink? A tea? Tea. Of course. I'll be back in a minute. Careful. It's hot. Thank you so much. For God's sake. Why have you been there? God, I was-- Why have you even been there? Well, I was walking home and I live near. Was around. Fuck! Could you see who it was? No, sorry. It was too dark. Didn't see anything. Sure it was one of these disgusting guys from my work who always harass me. Um. Why do you even work there? I mean you can find a better job anytime. No, it's not that easy. I'm lucky to have a job, you know. It wasn't always that bad. I had a husband. And I was also pregnant. We had a nice house in a good neighborhood here in Praha. And somehow... ...I lost everything. I was so broken after that that I wanted to kill myself a few times. But now, I try to get along with life and everything. I have a little apartment. Not as big as yours but it's okay. Somehow. It's okay now. Sorry. I don't know why I told you all that. It's okay. Sometimes it's good to let it all out. As far as I heard. What's your story, by the way? You don't look like you're from here. My-- my father was from Prague and my mother from-from the UK. I was born in England. Um. Lived here till I was nineteen. Then both were gone. I've had to move several times. I lived in Canada for a while. Australia. But now I'm here in Prague, for now. Back. Sounds busy and sad. It's okay. It seems you've seen and experienced a lot in your life too. And you look a little bit tired also. Aren't we all? Maybe true. But sorry to hear that. It's okay. Like I've said, I get along like everybody else. Gotta do what you gotta do. What's your name, by the way? Xavier. I'm Karolina. I know. Um, excuse me for a moment. Yeah. I'm sorry. I don't want to spy on you. I was just curious. Bad habit. Is that me? It's really cool. Um... You can have it if you want, it's yours. Thanks. It will get a special place. Uh... Thank you. Thank you for everything. Thank you. Thank you for everything. Thank you for everything. Thank you for everything. I thank you for everything. Yeah? I'm sorry, I didn't mean to. Sorry. Thank you for everything. Thank you for everything. Such a wonderful son. I thank you for everything. From now on, I'll take over. Darling, honey--
