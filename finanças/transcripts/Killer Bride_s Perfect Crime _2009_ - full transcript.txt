I will be happy from now. "Ooya's House" I'm coming! You've found a place? I'm moving into his. Really? Which mansion? It's a house. It's a house, Damien. With a huge garden - and a home theater system. - A home theater? There's a roof top Jacuzzi where you can gaze at the stars. A Jacuzzi? And a balcony decorated with flowers. A balcony. Work is complete. Of course, this apartment has been great, too. I know. I live next door. Right? Damien, where are you going? At this busy time... I'm rather busy with the wedding tomorrow... What are you doing? Well... Just a little more. Come on, you can reach it. I can do it! Oh! Oh! Oh, my god! Your scalp! My veil! My bridal veil! Excuse me for a second. No, my veil! "My athletic darling following my instructions passionately" Good morning! "You're a perfect compliment to my wine" "Brushing our teeth together, Good morning!" "A daring French kiss in bright daylight" "Happy together" Let's choose an auspicious day. Remember, Damien. This will be my wedding church. I like the decoration. I'll come back. Definitely! Excuse me. We have a call for you. I like this. See you on the big day. But, Why?! Why?? Excuse me, sir. Please take one. We are newly open. Please, take one. Come on, come on. Oh, no! My dear Ayaka! This job isn't right for me. Avaka! What the hell is this? "Marriage Certificate" "Numajiri Hiroko" "Ooya Santaro" "Numajiri Hiroko" What the hell is this?! Tell me! Are you okay? My Panties! Give it back! You okay? You're stretching my panties! Well...l... Look what you have done! Yeah. I'm sorry I forgot to tell you. I just finished painting it. I should have warned you. Huh? I'll pay for the dry cleaning. What do I do now? She's out. She's leaving the building. It's Numajiri Hiroko, the prime suspect. She has a jacket over her head. "A tragedy on the eve of wedding day" "A 25-year-old beautiful office worker" "A crime of passion?" "Numajiri Hiroko, office worker (25)" "A devil behind an innocent face" "A tragedy on the eve of wedding day" "For stealing her panties" No!! Kenichi! Let's call off the wedding. No! Now that she committed the unthinkable, she's been terrible at her job... making mistakes, getting in everyone's way. She's cursed with bad luck all her life! She lived alone with her grandfather. Maybe she was in some kind of trouble? She had a nickname from childhood. Numajiri Hiroko came at the bottom at everything she does. Hiroko "the loser"! Loser On your marks! "Time Sale Service" Get set...go! Don't push! Sold out. Hiroko the loser Loser Loser - Hiroko - "The loser" Loser Loser Loser Hey, loser! It's Hiroko, the loser! Losefl No! "Loser Fest" Hiroko the loser! Hiroko the loser! Hiroko the loser! Hiroko the loser! No! Hiroko the loser! Hiroko the loser! I will not be a loser for my wedding. What should I do? I'll turn myself in once the wedding is over. We'll keep you hidden until then. Or maybe until I come back... from the honeymoon. Wait a little bit, my dear Ayaka. We'll be reunited soon. A-YA- KA! Here. Thank you, so much! - Take this, too. - You sure? I'm sorry about what happened. No, really. It's no big deal. I'm okay. Thank you! My dear Ayaka, we finally meet again. Let me borrow it till tomorrow. What do I do now? Where do I go? It's still here. It didn't go away. An extensive search was carried out today in the woods of Fuji mountain. A total of 36 bodies were recovered most of which are unidentified and will be filed as 'John Doe'. Unidentified body? Filed as 'John Doe'? It's wrong to think about that. I said 'no'! A new destination entered, "Jukai." I'm here. I'm not looking for a place to bury you. Over there in the dark corner? What is that?! I failed again I cannot die You know? All I want is to die I don't want the sight of another man I devoted everything A perfect woman A perfect girlfriend, in other words You won't find a girl like me You won't see a girl like me hardly ever anywhere Innocent and submissive, healthy, lovely and elegant And still... Masato! Hiro! That hurts! KO-o! Oscar! Mister! Why, why?! Why did they dump me? That leaves me no choice but to kill myself. Drive. I'm exhausted. I can't even die. Here she comes. You see? Okay. "Jukai" YOu! How old are you? Twenty-five. You're still a kid. Too young to die. At least 10 years too young. That's not why I'm here. If no-one needs you you're good as dead. It's like you don't exist on the face of the earth. You might as well not exist. But... Even I don't need me. How pretty! God, Please! Take me away fast. No! - God! - You shouldn't think that! Already dead, though. This man, he's dead. Actually...Oh, the leg... It's a long story. - Oh, yeah? - Yes. I mean... Don't kill me! Please don't kill me! - I don't want to die. - You don't? No! Help me, somebody! You, murderer! - It's not like that. - Help me! She's a psycho killer. Help! What should I do? She'll go to the police. I'll be caught. So fast? Help me!! - What did you do? - I don't know. Watch it, moron! Who are they? I'll kick your asses if you do it again! I'm sorry. One more time, and I'll kill you! - What did you do? - Nothing! - Come on, let's go. - Yeah. Excuse me! What did she do wrong? What? What did she do? She started running from us. Let's get out of here! There are still punks like that. Have you seen these men...? Why are they running? What's going on? What's wrong with them? Hey, stop! Where's she gone? This is the worst day, ever. The worst! Is this... Yours? Hi, Ayaka! Squirt! Squirt... Tissue. Hiroko the loser, finished last again. That's okay, Hiroko. Losing isn't always bad. You make everyone happy. You're an angel that delivers happiness. Take this. Grandpa always encouraged me. Grandpa! And gave me the warmest hug. - Grandpa! - Hiroko! - Grandpa! - Hiroko! - Grandpa! - Hiroko! Grandpa! But, from some point, I became the one to give him a hug. It's not my time yet. Grandpa is fine. Till the day I see you in your wedding dress, I'll be fine. I wanted him to see me in wedding gown. No matter what. I'll turn myself in tomorrow after the ceremony. If I explain how it happened... Moving of the body Tempering with evidence And fleeing the scene. But, you... It's too late, now. Leave it to me. "Suicide Hand Book" This is... I'll help you. I'll pretend none of this happened. I don't expect so much from you. - In return, - In return? - You'll help me. - Help you? - Kill me. - What? We'll take care of the body together. And after, you'll kill me. Or I'll go to the police now. No! Unfortunately, I was born under a star sign that cannot commit suicide. That's a harsh fate. What's the big deal? You already killed one man. Killing another won't make any difference. It makes a world of a difference! That was an accident. All right! Let's take care of the body first. Let's go, loser. It's Hiroko. This is Mecca for the suicidal. The waterfall of silence. Once you jump-- you'll never be heard of again. Perfect, isn't it? The body will be completely consumed by the waterfall. I'm not sure about dumping him here... It'll get sucked right in... I'm only planning to hide until tomorrow. And become its prey. Miss Kobayashi? Sucked right into the core... Hello? Let me be its prey! Let go of me! I really could die here. No! Please, I love that waterfall. I almost forgot. I'm sorry I wasn't myself. That's okay. A wild boar devours all kinds of stuff into its belly. Flesh, bones, guts... Feeding him to a boar is a little... - Miss Kobayashi! - What? - Miss Kobayashi! - What, now? - These... - Huh? Are the boars, right? That's right. They're preying on us. Oh, my God! No! I don't want to be eaten alive! Wait! I'm sorry. I'm fast on my feet. That's okay. We should've been simple from the beginning. Body is broken down by micro-organisms and absorbed into the soil. I'm not so sure about burying... Get the light out of my eyes. - It's not me. - What? What are you doing here? - Scary. - Handsome. In middle of the night? A body... A body? K0bayashLH A body...pack! A body pack. A body pack? My sister is getting married. A full-body pack with the mud here does wonder for your skin. Isn't that so, Biroko? Biroko? Good night. Good night to you, too! The dinner was fantastic. The snails. Escargot. Snails... You don't know where life takes you. How did this happen? I know! Meeting the man of my life! What? Wife of a lodge owner? Not bad. It's wonderful, actually. I understand now. It was my fate to meet this man. In that case... What, Biroko? I don't have to kill you, then. Stop it! Don't say such a horrible thing. As if killing one wasn't enough. I mean... - Jiriko. - It's Biriko. Let's get moving and wrap this up. Wrap what up? You, idiot! What's going on? Hide! Can't sleep? No, I can't. I was having a drink. Wanna join me? I'd like that. Aren't you curious? What? Why a man is running a lodge here, alone. Okay, I'll tell you. I didn't ask. "Spiritual Paper Butterfly" That's just a model. I'm chasing an imaginary butterfly. If I catch it, maybe my wife who left with my son will come back to me. So, I keep searching for the imaginary butterfly that my wife loved. I like you! Please, hold me. - Biroko. - It's Hiroko. Stop it! Excuse me. Kobayashi You are mistaken. Finally, I meet someone who needs me. And, you blew it! What are you, a typhoon? Please calm down. Kill me! Go on! You like killing. I don't. Murder me and become a real murderer. Be miserable! How could you...? Happiness is derived from the misfortune of others. Others' misfortune? Seeing you in misery, will make me feel superior. I'll be happy! Go on. Kill me! If you kill me, I'll be happy. - Huh? - What! You don't get it? If you kill me, you'll be miserable. - You get that, right? - Right. Seeing you miserable will make me happy. So, kill me. - Wait a minute. - What, now? If I killed you, I'll be miserable. Then, I'll feel that I'm in a better position. - Who will? - Me! - If I killed you. - Of course! You can stand seeing me miserable? Of course! Because that'll make me happy. No, it won't...according to your theory. What's so hard to understand? Forget it, dumbo! Is that so? Kobayashi, wait! Forget it! I'll die without your help. A bit more... Happiness is derived from the misfortune of others. Everyone becomes happy because of you. Then, if I become happy, everyone will be miserable? For the happiness of others I must be miserable? Is that it? Grandpa? Help! Help me! Help me! What did you do this time? I don't know! Shut the door. I said watch it, moron! What should I watch out for? I said it, I said it. What? She wants to know why you're chasing her. Thanks. She ran. We chased because you ran from us. It's a conditioned reflex. We can't help it. - Let's get out of here! - Yeah. What's your fiancé like? My Kenichi? He's got bright smile, bright teeth, bright... You can stop there. There's more. The world isn't so bad, yet. Even a dumbo like you can find happiness. It gives me hope that I can be happy, too. Does it mean, that my happiness becomes everyone's happiness? At least, I don't have to be miserable for others to be happy. My happiness will be others' happiness, right? I don't know for sure but... Thank you, Kobayashi. Eat this. - It's not here. - What? Where did it go? We left it behind! Let's go. We have no choice. Come on, this way! " That way? - Hurry! Why are you running?! - Hop on. - What? - Hurry! " Okay_ Here we go! But, why? Why?! Hiroko! Out of the way! That'll teach you a lesson. What just happened? I don't know. - It's too narrow. - Indeed. What did we just do? Not sure. It's a cliff. We're falling off. We are, indeed. Why are you running from me? "Gorilla Land" There is a deep forest nearby. We'll bury him there. I'm not sure about burying... What time is the wedding? At noon. Plenty of time. Damn! Another route, another route. Have you seen them? You pass here often? What do we do now? What do we do, Kobayashi? We'll get caught. - It's not my problem. - What? - He's not my landlord. - But... He's your landlord. Don't assume that I'll do everything you ask. You make your own happiness. Bye! Kobayashfl Kobayashfl What should I do? What should I do, now? Hiroko, loser, Hiroko, loser! Loser, loser... You make your own happiness. I make my own happiness? That's it. This has nothing to do with me. A gorilla! Who are you pointing at? Daddy, a gorilla is swimming. What? Look! A swimming gorilla! Is that...? What a crazy kid! Thank you. Bye bye. Kobayashi? Hiroko, here! The gorilla is soaked up. Oi, you! Why are you running? Damn. Where did you get the strength?! Why? The chase ends here. Hear me out! Dad... You were awesome. It's all thanks to you. You walked away to test me, right? Of course! It's so fortunate that I met you. I really needed you. Need...me? Hey! Can we buy a T-shirt? "Convenience Store" I always need something sweet. Can't do without coconut jelly. Next, please. Yes. - Hands up! - My hand is up. Put the money in the bag. What are you looking at? Kobayashi Bad man is shot by even more bad... Kobayashi Kobayashi, over there! He's gone. Sure is. We got to go. To the wedding! We'll be late. - I got to make a call. - Where's the payphone? Where did you go? Into the sea? Grandpa... He refuses to leave. - Call the doctor. - Yes. Mr. Numajiri. Mr. Numajiri. Grandpa... I think he's about to pass. Oil! What's the matter? Come on! You got to let him see you in your wedding gown. This way! Wait! Explain to me! One, two. One, two. You've grown heavy, Hiroko. You okay? You're much heavier than you look. I've been fooled! Are you all right? Just leave it to me. I can't anymore! I'm exhausted. I'm gonna be sick. You're throwing up? Kobayashi I know! Why don't you run? Just run in that direction. Go on, hurry! Go! Help me! Kobayashfl There they are! Conditioned-reflex fools. Over here! Watch... I'm watching it, moron! What? Actually, I have some respect for you. How did you make so many of them? Friends! Will you be okay, Gakeru? She's a lonely woman. I'm speeding up. - Hold tight! - Okay. Until the day I see you in your wedding gown, grandpa will be fine. The wedding dress! It's too late. Can you hear me, Mr. Numajiri? He lost consciousness. Mr. Numajiri, are you okay? - Hurry! " Okay_ That was fast. I'll pay for this later. What are you, a quick-change magician? Here we go! What the... Careful, next time! Damn! Why? Why are you running from me? He won't give up. I don't think we can make it. Here they are, at last! "Church" Not bad! Out of the way! Clear the way! What kind of a bike gang obey the traffic lights? - Hello. - Long time. - Take care. - Thank you. Who is she? Go. Live happily ever after. We won't see each other again? Of course, we will. Whenever you need me again. It was the first for me, somebody needing me. You... You needed me. It was the first for me, too. Getting compliments from someone other than grandpa. You know, when I crossed the river. The gorilla butterfly? Yes, the gorilla butterfly. Go on. You've got to rush. Thank you. Thank you! Why are you running? In goes octopus... Packed by grandpa! - It's hot. - Wow! There you go. Thank you, grandpa! It's a sweet potato. I know. Damien? Thanks! There is something I have to tell him. Grandpa, you always said to me, that it's okay to finish last all the time. You said that with a smile. But, I always knew that you... that you cried... because of me hiding in the back without ever telling me. I knew that. That's why I was so anxious to be happy and give you the peace of mind. Look at me, grandpa. I'm a bride. Look! You don't have to cry any more. I'm sorry for everything. And, thank you for crying so much for me. Grandpa! Good for you, Hiroko. Grandpa! Grandpa! Everyone is happy because of you. You're an angel that delivers happiness. Dad... You came back! I'm sorry, Yuki. Spiritual Paper Butterfly... "Congratulations! Ayaka on DVD, now!" Are you serious? Thank you! Thank you so much! I'll do my best! We made it! Ayaka got a part in a TV drama! Good job! Grandpa! You're an angel of happiness. Two nights in jail for obstruction of justice? I should just kill myself. Wait! Damn! Actually, I don't have to run any more. Salute! Chasing you, made me realize again that I'm a police officer. Here. He's kind of cute on close inspection. Maybe he is the... I'll get going- Who am I kidding? Bye, bye. The bike moron Why are you here? You go after those who run from you. I didn't run, this time. You need me. Need...you? "Suicide Hand Book" Watch it, moron! It's time for your injection. And, I'll give this back to you. You were so lucky. It missed your heart by one millimeter. And I hope your memory will come back soon. No, it shouldn't, ever. I'll never leave this place. Easy! Easy! - Kenichi! - Yes, honey. The bath is amazing. Here. From my ex-colleagues? I should get them souvenirs. Let's go shopping tomorrow. Sure. Why won't you open? Come on. Beautiful! Even for airmail, this is too much. Simply divine... My precious! What do I do, now? Maybe... What are you doing there? Did you call for me? What will happen this time?
