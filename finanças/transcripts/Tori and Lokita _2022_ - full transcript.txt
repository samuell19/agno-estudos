I do, but it's easier to draw dreadlocks. So you prefer me with dreadlocks? - How much do we still owe them? - 600, plus 20 euros. Betim asked you to deal, why don't I do it? - No. - We'd have more money. - It's better that you go to school. - But you don't go. I told you, when I get my papers, I'll do a domestic service course.

You want your meds? Are you okay? - Do you want me to call Nadia? - No. Let's continue with the questions. How did you recognize your brother in the orphanage? I knew that he was born in 2011. I asked if any witch children were born in 2011. No, I have to be more specific. I will say what month you were born. Ask me again. How did you recognize your brother in the orphanage? I knew that... I knew that he was born in December 2011. I asked if any witch children were born in December 2011. And there was only one. Trick question: Do you remember if there were trees in the orphanage garden? No, I don't remember. Good, because there were no trees nor a garden. - How long has it been? - 35 minutes. - Too long. It doesn't sound good. - Everything will be fine. You weren't accepted? She was unable to answer some questions. Come sit down. Come on. One minute, I'm coming. Why can't my sister have her papers? - Who are you? - Tori, Lokita's brother. Ask Lokita, she knows. Excuse me, I have a meeting. I swear she is my sister. Without her, I'd be dead. Why do I have papers and she can't have them? You were a persecuted witch child, your files prove it. They also tried to kill her for helping me. It's the same thing. Her lawyer proposed a DNA test to prove it. It's the best solution. - Excuse me, I have to go. - Ma'am! What am I going to do here without her? - Why don't you give her the papers? - I'd like to, but I can't. Goodbye We don't want to separate, three months is a long time. Can't we...? No! - Just once a week? - I said no! You want fake papers, I find a solution for you... and now you negotiate with me. Are you crazy? - Do you want the papers or not? - Yes. ﻿- Can we meet at least on Sunday? - No. - I need an answer tomorrow morning at the latest, OK? - Yes. - How will we send money to your mom? - And to Firmin. I'm gonna work to pay for the papers, so I won't earn anything? That's right. You have a bed, food, and when you finish, the papers. ﻿Turn it off. On the market they cost a minimum of 10,000 euros. Can I still deal on Fridays? I told you, you have to be there permanently. Come on. How will we send money to our mother? That's none of my business! Go away! And your mother would have 50 euros every week. But it takes at least an hour. You can't go in at 23:00. - I'll go by bike. - What bike? There is one at the center. I just have to fix it. It's my obligation to earn money for the family, my obligation! ﻿Stop, Lokita! Why don't they want to give me the papers, Tori? - Why? - They don't want us. You're bleeding, come sit. Does it hurt? Not much. You're very nice, Tori. There is no one like you. No one. So you don't see where we're going. I don't understand. I'm going to blindfold you, so you can't see where we're going Turn your head. It's better for us and for you. Lift your feet. I'm taking the blindfold off. To turn the light on.
