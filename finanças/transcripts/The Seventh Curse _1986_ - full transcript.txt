I can't imagine... I'm so lousy... Over the years... I've used odd subjects for the many strange novels I've written. Everyone I meet asks... They say, 'Did they come from your imagination or true experience?' Asking this question... actually, it's a foolish question to ask. Because everyone has many strange things happen around them every day. Every little thing, as long as you're willing to dig deeper, can be turned into a strange story. Especially... if you often drink and chat with friends. Inside each person are many bizarre, complex stories for you to uncover. It's like tonight's situation. Two of my friends have come. - Wisley. - Mr Ni. - How are you? Where's Yuen Chan-Hap? - Oh, he's over there. - Your glasses are very handsome. - Mr Ni. - Congratulations, the Miss Asia winners. - Thank you. - Congratulations... - Thanks... Why do I need to toast with you? Yuen Chan-Hap, didn't you recently have a thrilling adventure with Wisley? - Really? - Tell us about it. Mr Ni's the best storyteller. It's only right Mr Ni tells it. A good story begins with a good glass of wine. Executive producer: LEONARD HO Starring: CHOW YUN-FAT, MAGGIE CHEUNG Starring: CHIN SIU-HO, SIBELLE HU Co-starring: DICK WEI, XU JIN-JIANG Story: NI KUANG Director: LAM NAI-CHOI Hunting Dog calling Thunderbird... Are all units ready...? This is Thunderbird, there are six robbers inside. One of them is a sharpshooter. They all have heavy-duty weapons. Tell everyone to be careful. Hunting Dog, you alright? Hunting Dog? You alright, Hunting Dog? - Quick, cease fire! - People below, listen! Go on, shoot and kill the hostage! Now he's having a major heart attack. If a doctor doesn't come, he's screwed! The doctor will be here soon. We have you surrounded. You've no chance of escape. Hurry up and surrender! WESTERN DAILY - What is it? - Miss! - I'm a reporter for Western Daily. - We know, but it's dangerous inside. You can't go in, please leave. - Please! - No way! - I just want in to take a picture. - I said, 'No way!' What's up, Wonder Woman? They won't let me in. I'm Dr Yuen. Officer Ho? The hostage is inside. He has a history of heart disease. - Why must you find me? - It's like this... We know Dr Yuen has had many past adventures and shown great courage. We want you to go in and plant a flash bomb. We can coordinate offensives and save the hostages. I'm no expert. Inspector Gong! Dr Yuen, I'll follow you inside disguised as a nurse. Let me detonate it. - Go and get ready. - Yes. There's a hidden compartment under the first aid kit. The flash bomb's in there. Well, that okay? Dr Yuen, remember now; it's twelve o'clock sharp. When the time comes, we'll break-in. The doctor's coming in! Don't open fire! LEE'S INDUSTRIAL CENTRE Grenade! - Don't move! - Bitch, don't move! I'm a woman, too. Move it! Move it! Kid, don't play any tricks! - Where's the patient? - Get up! Go... Give me the stethoscope. Everyone, don't be afraid. I'm a doctor. Heart-strengthening shot. What's wrong with you? Boss, there's a gun! Damn you! Kid, messing with me? Hold it! Who are you? I'm a reporter. Don't you realise what you did could've got us killed? Sorry. Where's my camera? I want to take some pictures. You still want pictures?! Dr Yuen, thanks a lot. The scene's under our control. Alright, I'll leave first. Okay, withdraw the team. Hey... are you going to arrest me? I've met a lot of pretty girls, but I've never met one as crazy as you. Do you know how many years you could get for this? - Then...? - You're still here? Many thanks! - Dr Yuen, thanks a lot. - Oh, it's nothing. Officer Ho! Inspector Gong was really brave just then. Thanks a lot. Officer Ho! Hey, aren't you that sexology writer... - Dr Cho? - Danny Wong? I heard you wrote a paper recently on the relationship between climate and the Chinese male's sexual performance. Oh, it's just a matter of mathematical proportions. Temperature is directly proportional to time. Now, the temperature in the south's a bit higher; it's about an hour. In the middle, about half an hour. Temperature in the north's a bit lower; it's about two to three minutes. Hey, as I recall, you're from Hainan Island (South China Sea). Yeah, but according to your logic, I must be from the North Pole! You must be joking! Those chicks are real pretty. Dr Cho... if the wine is yours... the chicks should be mine, right? - Isn't that funny? - So funny... Do you believe in astrology? I can see from just your look, you're a Virgo. Hey, it's alright. Explain it in your own time. - Annie, let's sit over there. - Virgo girls had better find Taurus boys just like me. You must be a Cancer. I've many collectibles at home. There's a human head made by a New Guinea headhunting tribe. Shrunk to be as big as a monkey's head. How frightful! Also, there are legends of toes chopped off by aliens. That's so disgusting! What else is there? - Also there's... - Also there's, me! Yuen Chan-Hap. I've something very important to tell you. What the hell are you doing? Miss, before you're deceived by him, I'll be honest with you: he's already married. Hey, what're you saying?! I see, I best get out of the way now. - Hey! Don't you go! - What the hell do you want? Sorry, I know I wrecked your plan to pick up girls, but it was important that I find you. - Speak, then. - Okay! On behalf of Western Daily, I'd like to do an exclusive interview with you. I want to introduce your heroic deeds and take some nude photos of you. Hey, I guarantee the photos will have aesthetic perception. My photography skills aren't bad. Please believe me. Excuse me! It's none of my business! Fool! Hey, fool! - Pull up! - I won't see you later! Hey, fool! Thought I couldn't catch up with you? You're dirty, mean, and shameless! You're a real stinker! The night's still young... - Yuen Chan-Hap? - Who are you? You're coming to Thailand with me. You must save yourself, and then save Bachu. What're you talking about? It's been a year since a blood curse was placed on you. Soon it will burst out. Bachu was hit by a Ghost-Face curse. We need your help. I don't understand what you mean. Don't play dumb. This is my address in Thailand. I'll wait three days for you. Hey, don't go! What's your name? My name's Black Dragon. Listen, never get close to a woman. Otherwise, it'll burst out immediately. Mr Wai, you're my best friend and my master. I think only you can help me. Ever been to Northern Thailand? Ah So, could I trouble you to make two cups of coffee? Alright. You seem to be suffering the most powerful blood curse in witchcraft. I want to know the circumstances in detail. It's like this... A year ago, I went to Northern Thailand with a medical expedition to find a herbal medicine to treat AIDS. - Good morning, Professor. - Good morning. Good morning... Professor, I want to take a stroll near the lake. You must be careful, it's close to the Miao tribe of Chinese Yunnan. I've heard there's a Gu Tribe on the Sino-Thai border that's especially skilled at witchcraft. I don't believe in witchcraft, I only believe in aliens. Sorry, I broke your treasure. It doesn't matter, I have more. It's for you. - Really? - Really. I must go. You shouldn't approach that girl. The people of that Gu Tribe are cruel and callous. Besides, there are many unimaginable sorceries. Professor, if just chatting to her results in black magic, their tribe must have nothing better to do. Regardless, I'm team leader. As far as your team goes, I'm responsible for its safety. Those drumbeats...? Those are the drumbeats of the Gu Tribe; it's a sacrificial drum. So they're offering a sacrifice to God? You mustn't go over and look. Hey, we won't look... Wow! What a spectacle! - Let's go over. - Right. It's her. - Say, who is she? - The one I saw this afternoon. - Who's that? - Who the hell is it? I don't know! Have you made a decision? I won't promise you. You may be chosen as a sacrifice to God. When the Old Ancestor awakens, you will die. You purposely cast out Black Dragon to choose me again. I'll never give in. My love is for Black Dragon alone. I won't promise you. My people. Once a year when the Old Ancestor wakes up, God's decree will choose which of you receives His glory. Great Wizard, Bachu's the daughter of our tribe's former chief. Please don't sacrifice her to God. This is God's decree! But we've never done it before. Who else disagrees? Put them in the ancient tomb. I'm going to save her. You can't be serious?! Have you lost it? You're liable to get killed! I'll act accordingly, you guys get your weapons. - Don't... - Hey... don't... - What do we do? - What now? Hurry up and go! He's our Old Ancestor, he won't die. Hurry up and go! Don't bother about me! I told you to go now! Forget about me! Save me... Hurry up! Someone's destroyed the altar. Quickly, go and see. Those drumbeats again! He knows someone's destroyed the altar and will hunt you down. Run! Professor! You didn't follow orders. Now see what's happened! Hurry back to the camp, pack up and go! Run! Quick, run! Bachu... Get in the car! You two destroyed the Sacrificial God, and blasphemed the Old Ancestor. Today I will represent God, and give you the punishment you deserve. Professor, you... Yuen Chan-Hap, help me! These worms reproduce very quickly. But you don't have to worry, I won't use them to deal with you. I'm really sorry. Hurry up and go! Don't let them catch you. You must go... This is the magic that protects my body. Now I use it to save you, but... By the time I woke up, Bachu had gone. All seven blood curses on my body had gone. That's why I came back alone. It's been a year since I returned to Hong Kong and nothing's happened. I can't believe now that... Black Dragon warned you, why didn't you believe him? I didn't even know the guy. Who knew what he wanted me for? That's true. You're still... What's wrong, Chan-Hap? Ah So, get the first aid kit. The second blood curse has burst. So when did the first burst? It was about the same time. If that's the case, that's a burst every 24 hours. In five days it'll burst in your heart, and you'll die. Mr Wai, you know so much about witchcraft. Can I be cured? The blood curse is the most mysterious and complex of witchcraft; it's also the most powerful. Bachu used her body magic to protect you, but it could last only a year. So there must be a reason why Black Dragon asked you to Thailand. You're saying I should go to Thailand? Chan-Hap, whoever starts the trouble should end it. Okay, I'll find Black Dragon in the morning. Hey! It sounds so exciting! You must give me an exclusive. It's you again?! Cousin... do you know him well? Mr Wai... Chan-Hap, Choi Hung is Mr Wai's cousin. She's always been headstrong. Don't blame her. - Ah, you stick your nose into everything. - I know him very well. Hey, how about it? Now, I don't need your naked pictures. Can I go with you to Thailand? - Think I'm going for fun? - Choi Hung... this is a serious matter. You can't go. So you're saying I'm not up to scratch? Didn't you know? I risked life and limb with Dr Yuen. Right, Dr Yuen? I won't let you come with me. Chan-Hap, I'm busy tomorrow. The day after I'll help you. If you need to call the Thai police, I can get in touch with them. - Thanks a lot. - You're welcome. Cousin, aren't you going to help me? A reporter's material-gathering must have limits. This matter is life-threatening. You're only working for pocket money. I don't want you in any trouble. BANGKOK AIRPORT Mr Yuen Chan-Hap? That's me. - Please come with me. - You are...? My boss asked me to pick you up. You'll see when you get there. - Where's your boss? - Mr Yuen, please sit for a while. Thanks. Fool! It's you again?! I came on an earlier flight. Why are there so many weapons here? We're venturing into a primaeval forest. Taking these will give us a better sense of security. And this is the latest laser-guided gun. Can you afford it? My daddy's Dung Tai-Ping. Hong Kong real estate king, Dung Tai-Ping? What do I care if he's king? As long as he has an unlimited Gold Card for me to use. Pretty, ignorant, young, knows no danger... and wealthy on top. I think you're the most troublesome woman in the world. Every time I bought materials, I paid out of my own pocket. We're not going to war now. Besides, witchcraft isn't something that can be shot to death, Miss! Hey... shall we talk business? I've already sold it to the editor and been in touch with the United Press. If I can get your story, it'll make headlines worldwide. You in for half the profits? I don't have time for your insanity. I don't care! Regardless, I must go! Think you can tie me up?! Hey, you fool-- Don't underestimate men! You came at last. You seem... I was hunted upon my return. Who's hunting you? The Great Wizard. He knows I've found you. As a result, he's colluded with the Bangkok underworld to deal with us. Turns out they were in contact. That's why I was ambushed as soon as I got back. Then let's get out of here. - This is the Gu Tribe? - No. This is a good tribe that farms for a living. But the Gu Tribe often harasses them. Dragon, it's good you came back. Tribe Leader, what's going on? Something strange has happened to us. All the children in the village suddenly disappeared this afternoon. - Suddenly disappeared? - Yes. What's the matter? The children in our village mysteriously disappeared. The Wizard must've taken them to refine a Ghost-Child curse. Ghost-Child curse? It takes the blood of 100 children to refine the Ghost-Child curse. They can fly and suck blood. Anyone who resists will die. But after three years it ceases to work and must be refined again. He's really too cruel! Yeah, I saw a ghost child the night of the God sacrifice. The Tribe Leader hopes that I'll take all the village warriors to rescue them. - Good. - Hey, I'm going, too! - It's so quiet tonight. - Yeah. So quiet there's no sound of insects. Something's wrong for sure. Be careful. Quick, run! Hey, don't go... Don't run around! Come back! It hurts! I told you not to follow. Do you know how dangerous it is here? Shit! If I stop following after following... then not following would make me an idiot! Don't you realise, there are many mechanisms buried here? Don't you worry! When I was studying in America, I read many books about killing mechanisms in the Vietnam War. This proves it. I can take care of myself. Enough talk. We're fighting for time. Let's go. I'll go up and see. Don't make any noise. Choi Hung! Hey, where are you going? - To take a picture. - Choi Hung, you're with me. I'm responsible to Mr Wai for your safety. It's too dangerous here. I can't let you mess around. You don't need to be responsible. Chauvinist! Choi Hung, will you listen to me? I've been through here before, it's too dangerous. There are things you couldn't possibly imagine. Let go! I'm warning you! If you touch me again, I'll tell my cousin that you molested me. That said, with your reputation... there could be two out of ten people who wouldn't believe it. I don't care what you say. You better listen to me... Or else, I'll take off your pants, spank your arse, and take a picture! Would you dare?! You're despicable! Yeah, so what? I won't talk to you! I'll go and never come back! Alright, as you wish. Even if I'm bitten by a poisonous snake, shot with a poison arrow, or terrified, I still won't come back! I won't talk to you! Don't regret it when I'm gone! You're really something! Bye-bye, then! Where'd she go so fast? The children are all locked in cages. There are many guards. - I think it's best we save Bachu first. - Okay. Where's Miss Choi Hung? She lost her temper again, and has already gone back. Never mind her. By the way, where is Miss Bachu? Bachu! Black Dragon. I brought Dr Yuen. I'm here. - Bachu! - Don't come over! I don't want anyone to see how I look. Never mind, I was shocked by the way she looks. Bachu. My fourth blood curse has already burst. We need to find a way to save you and me. My father told me before he died, that there's a kind of magical, sacred object called a sarira, that can break all black magic. A year ago, after I was struck by the Ghost-Face curse, I researched the ancient books of my ancestors. Eventually, I found out where the sariras are hidden. - Where are they? - A giant Buddha hidden in a cave. There's no way up. No one has ever climbed it. So we can't get the sariras? I believe you're my saviour sent from Heaven. That's why I asked Black Dragon to find you. I can give it a try. You have three days to live. You've no choice but to try. I'll go back and cable them, have someone bring the equipment. Also, Dr Yuen... a sarira will dry up six hours after it's taken out. Help! What are you doing? Put me down! I'll give you money! Let me go! Let me go! Let her go! You must be the boss here. You're such a great guy! I'm going now! Actually, I just went the wrong way and accidentally fell into a trap. Did Black Dragon bring you here? No! Oh, I'm here to collect specimens. Wow! You're such a wise, divine warrior. I'll take a photo for you. Go to hell! Okay, I know. That's all... Hey, the equipment and reinforcements will be here soon. - Hasn't Choi Hung come back? - Strange. Why hasn't she come back? - Where could she have gone? - There are two possibilities: one is she's dead; the other is they've captured her. If she was captured, where would she be held? She's foreign and would surely be taken to the Great Wizard. Then let's save Bachu first. Let's save Choi Hung first. Good friend! Miss Choi Hung! Choi Hung's alright, isn't she? Her temperature's very unusual, but no sign of fever or chills. I'll go out and see if the reinforcements have arrived. Choi Hung?! What is it? She's lost her nature, but gained super strength! Choi Hung... what's wrong with you? Hold her down! How did this happen? She was taken by the Great Wizard. She became like this after we rescued her. In my opinion, she was struck by a Black-Heart curse. Hence the super strength. She'll kill anyone in sight. Then how do we break her curse? Let me. Bachu? To break the Black-Heart curse, use black to make black. Use the blood of seven black animals, including a black sheep, black cow, black dog, black cat, black snake, black eagle, and a black lizard. Mix the seven types of blood into boiling water and let her soak. Soak her until she wakes up. Ghost! - What's wrong? - What's the matter? She caught sight of my face. It's alright... Her appearance was harmed like this by the Great Wizard. We relied on her to save your life. She's alright. Dr Yuen, time's running out. You must hurry and get the sariras. Black Dragon! Whether you get the sariras or not, you must come back. I'm going with you. Choi Hung, don't be headstrong. Then, you must come back. What's the matter? Mr Wai, the sixth blood curse burst on my ribs, but didn't shed much blood. But when the seventh blood curse bursts, all the blood in your body will flow out of the cavity. Mr Wai, tomorrow's my last day in this world. Chan-Hap, I don't believe that fate can control a courageous man. I believe man can conquer nature. Black Dragon. - What's the Great Wizard's name? - Great Wizard Agula. Agula? The Agula family witchcraft is the most mysterious and cruel in the Indochina Peninsula. - Did he refine a Ghost-Child curse? - Yes. Find a cow right away, must be pregnant. After slaughter, keep the placenta. Also, kill a black dog, keep the blood. - Go ahead. - Okay! Mr Wai, what's this used for? I was friends with one of the sons of the Agula family. He taught me how to break the Ghost-Child curse. I've no idea if it'll work. Chan-Hap, this time it's down to you. Old Ancestor... Give me strength. Use the power of the blood to transform into a blood demon. Go and exterminate Yuen Chan-Hap! Where are the two sariras? Inside that pair of eyes. We'll have to climb up slowly. That a problem for you? I've climbed the Himalayas. They say no one who's gone up to get the sariras has come out. It's up to us. Look out! Be careful. Yuen Chan-Hap! Dear Masters! We're using the sariras to save people from a demonic curse. Please, dear Masters, help us succeed. Go quickly! Get out of the way! Yuen Chan-Hap... Yuen Chan-Hap! Quick, swallow the sarira, remove your blood curse first. Hurry, swallow it! We must get back within two hours, otherwise, the other sarira will be useless. Choi Hung and Bachu were captured. Hurry up and rescue them! Go on! I'll catch up with you later. - Let's go! - Right! Old Ancestor must be very happy today. Three men and three women brought for him to eat. God will punish you! Yuen Chan-Hap is coming to kill you! I'm just waiting for them to come. We're already here... I told you he would come. Old Ancestor! Agula, you've committed multiple evils and injustices. Now, you're caught in your own trap! Old... Look out! Choi Hung! Go to hell! Black Dragon! Get out of the way! Release the ghost child! Where's that sarira? It's here. Shit! It's expired! Then Bachu can't restore her original appearance? Black Dragon, if I look like this for the rest of my life, will you still love me? The Great Wizard is dead. Our tribe henceforth will be reborn. I can help them live a better life. Then, isn't that a pity? A woman's true beauty is not on her face, but in her heart. I've heard your masterpiece 'Red Apricot Seeking Spring' is to be published. Yeah, James Wong contributed to the writing. - He'll get commission. - I know, but it's worth a gamble. - Someday I'll gift you a copy. - Good. Old Wong. You really don't believe me? My home houses many collections. There's a headhunter's head, the toes of several aliens. There's also the harvested blood of innocent children. - Really? - You don't believe me? Of course, I don't believe you. Right! You're spot on! He uses this demeanour to cheat women into bed. I was also his victim! Hey, you... Excuse me, I must leave first. Hey... Mina... Goodbye. - I've no idea, they have low IQs. - That's right. Ah Fei, let's go disco dancing. I'm in luck! Go? Quick, let's go! You've ruined it for me again! You're not busy? Did your editor give you the sack? My dad gave me the capital to open a bigger paper. Now I'm the boss! What do you want? Come to the Himalayas with me to find the Abominable Snowman! You must be dreaming! That was great. Go on, tell us another one. Marvellous, tell us another one... That all depends on what new adventures Wisley and Yuen Chan-Hap will embark upon.
