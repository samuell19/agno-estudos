Archie, breakfast. There you go. Hi Mrs. Sullivan, welcome back. Good morning Amelia. Thank you so much for taking care of Archie. He was great as usual. Come for a Cup of coffee? I mean it's the least I can do. I actually have a huge meeting in a few minutes but thank you. Oh, you work all the time. You ever going to take a vacation? I mean one of these days. Well maybe one day. I'm hoping to start running my own column soon. You don't get there without a lot of hard work. Well you will get there. I know it. Good boy! Well... if you ever want to take a break you know where to find us. Thank you. Say bye bye. Oh bye Archibald. Bye bye. Say bye bye. Say bye bye. Okay. Good morning everyone. Good morning. Brad, what's that thing? Bagel. You know I'm on a juice cleanse. Put that thing away. Amelia, great job on the South African penguins piece. My mom told me that she cried when she read it. That's exactly the response we were looking for. Stories like that get us more subscriptions. Thank you and Brad your photos were incredible as usual. Oh, I mean, your daily research notes were key. I empathize with them. It made all the difference. We make a great team. I don't understand how you do it without ever visiting the places that you've written about. Well I'm really glad the story got such a great response. Actually my last few stories have gotten great responses so Madeline I was hoping we could discuss the possibility of starting my own column. I'm ready. Hmm. As you both know, Geographic Lives one hundredth issue is being published in one week. The top story that we had planned for the marine section turned out to be a total bust so now we are desperate for a mind blowing story. I just heard that there are two baby manatees that are being rehabilitated at a conservation center Puerto Rico and ready to be released back into the wild. Baby manatees... Our readers are going to eat it up. Amelia. Are you in? Absolutely, sounds like a great story. I'll get started on the research right away. Not this time. I need you on the ground asap. On the ground? Mm hmm. You're a great writer, one of our best. But if you truly want to become an incredible one you need to step out of your comfort zone, get your hands dirty. See you're great at that research thing but it's time for you to get in the thick of the action. Brad, of course you'll join her. Yes, dream team. I'll book you two a flight, first thing in the morning to Puerto Rico. Tomorrow umm? My house plants are super high maintenance. I really shouldn't leave them alone. Have your neighbor take care of them. You watch her dog, like, all the time. Well I sort of don't have a passport. You don't need a passport to go to Puerto Rico, darling. Right. Well I... Amelia, this is our centennial issue. The biggest issue that we've ever done and your work would be the section's top story. You nail this piece. You'll get your column. I'll send you over the briefings this afternoon. Gotta run. Don't let me down. Hello. Brad, where are you? Amelia? Brad, where are you? I got sick last night and I slept through my alarm. I missed the flight. I'm so sorry you're sick but... There's no way I can go to Puerto Rico like this. Trust me, you don't want to be near me. I feel terrible. I really do but how am I supposed to do this without you. I'm not a photographer. Your camera phone is probably good enough. All you have to do is point the camera and push the button. Well I don't think it's that simple. I'll just edit them for you, from here. Send them to me as you go. Don't worry, Madeline never even has to know. Brad? We're a team remember? You got this. Need a ride? No, I'm good. Thanks. Are you? Okay. I'm Timothy from La Hoya de Bahia. Valeria sent me to pick up two V. I. P.'s. You're Amelia. Hi yes, actually it's just gonna be me though. Well great it's your lucky day. You get the front seat. Hop in. Oh yeah. So, uh, first time in Puerto Rico? Yes, uh huh, yep. Welcome to the island. I've been down here a little over a year, from the states too Chicago originally. Yeah, I came down here on business. I stayed in the villa and I decided I never wanted to leave so I went back, I quit my corporate job and moved down here and now I'm running the Philip Bar. What a life right? It sounds exciting. Yeah, so you travel much? Not really. Well, this is a good place to start. I tell you, once I got out it changed my life. You know maybe the same thing will happen to you, right? This island has a way of making you fall in love. Oh yeah. We made it. Hi. Hola Amelia. I'm Olivia. Nice to meet you. Welcome to be a guest and welcome to La Hoya de Bahia. The children of the bay. It's beautiful. She sure is. Okay, well I'm gonna get the jeep parked. We'll, uh, see later. Welcome. Thank you for the ride. Oh we are so thrilled to be hosting you. Let me show you to your room. Follow me. We have breakfast every morning, outside in the courtyard and the conservation center is next to the beach. Not too far away. And our pool is a lifesaver on a day like today. And what's your WiFi? Oh WiFi info is all in that book and there's also information on fun excursions we can help you book. Like kayaking, snorkeling. That's okay I'm just here for work. Where's your business center? Oh, we don't have business center. But feel free to work in the courtyard. It's a wonderful place to read. Great, thanks. Well... I leave you to get settled. That's better right? Just point the camera, press the button. Ow! Hola. Sorry, do you speak English? Oh... I was wondering if I could see the photograph that you took of me. Oh sure. Sorry, I didn't mean to... I'm trying to practice. No, no it's not bad. You're just... trying to be too symmetrical. Take your subject. Frame him up but don't put him exactly center. Okay, allow the world to compliment his aura. Exactamente, you got it. Hey, actually I'm a journalist in town on an assignment and my photographer bailed last minute. Any chance you could help out? Are you a professional photographer? I'm an artist. Most mediums, I do it all but today I am a photographer documenting this beach cleanup but... Hey I'll be happy to give you tips whenever I can. I'll be around. Great. I'm Amelia by the way. Luis. Could I also suggest a visit to my wife's dress shop while you're here. I can have her hook you up with some new, like, island wear. No, that's okay. I'm just here for a few days. Wait, how do I find you? Ah, it's a small island. The small island of Vieques is home to manatees and a small Puerto Rican population who care deeply about conservation. Oh no... oh I'm so sorry. Oh I'm so sorry. I can't believe I did this. It's from the... Amazon. What? Was this... a special pot from... Please tell me I did not just break a special pot from the Amazon. Si. It was very special. It's made out of a red clay from the Amazon. I'll be able to replace it right? No, it's one of a kind and ancient. Valeria will be devastated. Oh, what should I do? You should try to save the pot so it's soul survives. Try super glue. Oh no. It's soul? Okay I can do that. Where can I find super glue? Amelia, are you okay? Valeria, I am so sorry. I was out here working and my cord must have gotten caught... It's okay, it's okay dear. I bought it off Amazon. I just order another. Hello? What are you doing here? You again? Are you following me? You know your joke earlier was not funny. Oh, maybe you just don't have a sense of humor. So, what are you doing in my office? Your office? This is my office, yes. You're Fernando Rivera, the head of the conservation center? And you are? I'm Amelia Day. The journalist from Geographic Life. I'm here to cover the release of manatees. Really? What? I don't look like a journalist? Sorry but now really isn't a good time. Good luck. I'd love to schedule an interview with you and of course meet the manatees personally. I told you, now isn't a good time. I can wait. A manatee got caught in a fishing net. They need my help. I'll probably be a while. I could come back in a few hours then. Why do you even want to write about us? We're such a tiny operation. It's a small story. There's no such thing as a small story. Actually, wait, you invited me here. Actually... I didn't. Then who did? Bye. Well I see you've met my son Jose. Oh he's so cute. I just stopped by to give you this. It's old but it'll do the trick. I figured you could use it while you're here. Oh thank you so much. That's so nice of you. Oh por favor, de nada. Are you sure you don't want to check out my wife's shop? She'd be happy to hook you up. You know the days are only getting hotter right? That's okay I'm not here for a long. Wait, how did you find me? I told you it's a small island. Hola, Lisa. Hey how'd the rescue go? Is the manatee safe? Yeah we got him. He'll be fine. Hey, did you know anything about that journalist coming here? It's great right? So you knew? You know the center could use some more funding. Lisa? What aren't you telling? She told me not to tell you? Tough day? No I'm okay. What's on your mind? I'm not sure who asked for Geographic Life to come down here. Or why. And the head of the conservation center was not interested in talking to me. He was not very welcoming, to put it mildly. Fernando? I'm sorry. I didn't realize you knew him. He'll warm up to you. He's a great guy, ok. Loves his job. Maybe give him another chance? Well, that early flight is hitting me now. I'll see you tomorrow. All right. Good night. Thank you. Good night. Night. So how was our guest this evening? She barely touched her plate. Yeah I guess, Fernando wasn't very nice to her. What why? Something about not wanting to do an interview today and he didn't ask for a journalist to come down here. Fernando has such big dreams. He used to talk about to expanding the center but now I feel he's like... stuck. I wanted to do something for him. You're like a mother to him he knows that. I thought maybe with this article, the world could see how wonderful he is at his job. He could be reminded of all those dreams. I just want him to be happy. Well, I think you should talk to him because this article is a great idea and who knows, if it goes well, you know, it means maybe more visitors to the villa right? Win, win. You start early tomorrow morning. Meet me in the courtyard at 6:00 AM. 6:00 AM? Nature rises early. 6:00 AM. Oh, Coming... Ow. We have to stop doing that. You're late. I'm so sorry. I'm never late just give me two minutes. Thank you. Okay, ready. Is that how you wake up every morning? Yeah, why? And you're bringing your books with you? Should I not? What's wrong with my books? So I was researching manatees and Puerto Rico last night and I have a lot of questions. We'll get that. Soon or? This is Elisa Rodriguez. She's a junior researcher and a pivotal team member of the Moana and Oceano project. Elisa, this is Amelia Day. She's the journalist from Geographic Life. Nice to meet you. I would love to talk to you, as well, at some point. Um, is there a desk I can use? Is that you? Yes. Wow, you look just like your father. You ready to go? Food prep. I thought you were taking me to see Moana and Oceano. Never said that. Okay. This works too. So would you say this is a typical meal for... hey. You want me to chop these? Food prep is a very important job at the conservation center. Everything needs to be recorded to make sure the manatees get the proper nutrition. I'm a journalist. You can just admit you've never chopped a vegetable before. I have chopped... I'm not dressed for cooking. It's dirty. You want me to tie it for you too? No, I got it. I got it. Okay. Here. Like this. I got it. Okay. Fernando, I'll be right back. Here's a chart, how to cut of everything. How much of everything. You can handle it right? I think I got it. All right. Manatees require specific nutrition and lots of it. The conservation center maintains thorough logs of the food needed for each manatee in their care. Due to the remote nature of the islands, all food for the manatees is locally sourced. You ready to meet them? For real this time? Well you'll need a change of clothes first. We have some extras for the volunteers. What's wrong with what I'm wearing? The center operates a small cove where we can safely rehabilitate the manatees in a more natural environment. So tell me how did they end up here? Their mother died in the hurricane. We rescued them. They've been recuperating for a few years now but they're growing up so we'll have to let them go. So how does a conservation center like yours take care of baby manatees? Walk me through it. Okay, you'll see. We're almost there. Did you know manatees can swim as fast as fifteen miles per hour? That's pretty impressive given their size. Yes, but only in short bursts. Mangroves offer everything the manatees need. Come on in. Oh no, that's okay I'm just here to observe. You don't come all the way here just to observe. Better? And here they are Moana and Oceano. Wow. Oh my gosh, they're incredible. Say hello to Amelia, guys. Wanna see where they're gonna be released? Absolutely! Ok, the center keeps kayaks not too far from here. Kayaks? Do you know of a better way to explore mangroves? Umm... no but that's okay, um, I should just get back to the center, ah, I can read about manatee habitats in one of the books I brought. Come on, a real journalist would say yes to adventure. Don't worry it's not that deep. Uh, I'm just... not really a fan of the ocean. How can a wildlife reporter be afraid of the ocean? What about... snorkeling and coral reefs? Wait seriously? All right, that's what we're doing next and I'm not taking no for an answer. I don't even have a swimsuit. Fernando! Oh. Come on. Wait! How am I supposed to take notes? You're not. Come on. Come on, it won't bite. Oh my gosh, what is that? What! Oh my gosh, what is that? I! Oh my, this is so embarrassing. Not at all. All right you're just not used to it yet. There's nothing scary in the water, I promise, Okay. Just make sure you buy down like this and breathe normally. Even under water? Even under water. Got it? Okay. I have never seen anything... anything like that. Like what? The ocean. Yeah, it's a whole new world down there isn't it? Yeah. I think that's what scared me so much about it. There's just still so much unknown about the ocean but... it's so beautiful. I don't know what it was so afraid of. Oh, I have to write this down! Now, where exactly were we? You think that was beautiful? You want see something truly spectacular? I've never seen anything like this. That is a yellow shouldered blackbird. They live here in the forest but lay their eggs in the protection of the mangroves. It's beautiful. You seem very connected to this place. I am. This is where I come to think. It's always here if I need to escape for a little while. What got you interested in all of this? I studied marine biology in college and got a job in San Diego after graduating. What brought you back here? After the hurricane, Valeria needed help and... I realized this was paradise. Why live anywhere else? See this here? Cereus Epiphyllum Oxypetalum. Night blooming cactus. Exactly, we commonly call it... Queen of the night. They produce a beautiful, white, fragrant flower that only blooms at night. Individual plants can produce up to a dozen blooms at a time but each one only blooms for one night. As beautiful as it is determined. You really know your plants. It's part of the job. Here we are. You were right. This is amazing. Now see those small islands over there? Vieques is part of the passage islands. Now each island historically had different uses. A group of islands working together. You hear that? It sounds like... music. It's a symphony. All of nature's instruments working together, in perfect harmony. I can't believe I've been missing this, all this time. Well, you miss a lot, when you're looking down at a book. Even I take it for granted sometimes. Sometimes you miss what's right in front of you. I, uh, I started with the conservation center but one day I want to expand and work to protect more Puerto Rican wildlife. It all deserves protecting. That you can quote me on. Thank you for the fun day. It was definitely memorable. Yeah, I had fun actually. Oh, welcome back! How was your day? She's getting there. I'm helping her become a real journalist. Just when I thought we were getting along. Well, I'll see you tomorrow. I'm looking forward to it. What? Oh nothing. So, how's everything going? Good, I think. I still can't believe Geographic Life wants to do a story about us! Why not? We're a tiny operation man. No one even knows about us. Not yet, my friend. I think this is going to be huge for your center. I know how much work you put into that place man. Your heart and soul. Thanks man. You know, all this has made me start thinking about expanding again. That's great. Amelia's really helping me rediscover that. So, you had fun with her? Come on man. It's not like that. Oh, you know, the center and those manatees can't be your only loves. You're going to need to let someone, like a person, in at some point, like a human being. Oh, okay, see that is enough for me right now. I don't have time for anything else. I'm telling you amigo, this happens when you least expect it. Look at me and Yara. I wasn't looking for a girl. I thought it wasn't the right time and then she finally wore me down. Made an honest man out of me. I think you mean you wore her down. What's that supposed to mean? You must be starving. How did you know? Thank you. So, tell me, what was your favorite part of the day? Oh, definitely meeting Moana and Oceano. Or kayaking through the mangroves. So beautiful. Or snorkeling. That was new for me. I guess it's all new. It sounds like Fernando was a wonderful guide. Oh, he's great. I mean, so knowledgeable. He gave me a lot to think about, for the article. Uh huh, for the article. Here we go, ladies. Valeria's favorite. You sure know how to treat us well, Timothy. Well have fun. Thank you. Timothy's pretty great, huh? He is. You know, at first, I thought he was joking when he asked for a job. He was this corporate business guy. Thought he was so uptight... but I was wrong. Now, I can't imagine running this place without him. Excuse me. Oh, I'll be back. Hello. What? What happened to her? What's going on? We were doing a lift test on Moana. She panicked. But, we did a practice one with her last week. She was fine. I know, something's wrong. I should've been there. Moana's still showing signs of stress. I don't think it's a good idea to release her today. You're right. And we can't separate Moana from Oceano which means... which means, they cannot be released into the wild today. You've reached Fernando. Leave a message at the beep. Hey Fernando, it's Amelia, um... I guess you must be running late. I, on the other hand, was early this morning. Um, anyway, I'm still at the villa, so give me a call, when you get a chance. South African penguins lay their eggs when temperatures are cooler. However, it is not uncommon for the penguins to become over heated, in the sun, while guarding their eggs. So they must make a difficult choice. Protect their young or themselves. Timothy, hey. Hey. Have you seen Fernando this morning? Uh, no, it's been pretty quiet around here. He told me to meet him here. I've been trying to get a hold of him all morning. I'm sure he's just running late. Good morning Val. Good morning. Morning. Good morning. I'm going to head over to the center. If either of you hear from Fernando please call me, ok. Of course, cariño. So hey, I have a good feeling about her article and I figured, you know, maybe some updating around here, might be a good thing so I already started on the patio, around the pool. That was you? Of course, it was me. Did you go and hire somebody when I wasn't looking? No. Come on. It's just us. You know, I don't thank you enough, for all you do around here. Hey, you want to sit down with me? I'm about to have breakfast. Oh, I can't. I have a few guests arriving soon, so I have to check their rooms, get everything ready. Oh, you work too hard. You're one to talk. No release, no article. I mean there's a chance that it might happen tomorrow but... Well that's life man, it happens. Amelia's counting on me and Valeria thinks that this article can help the villa and Elisa thinks that the article can help the center get more funding and... I feel like I'm failing them. Nando, this is not your fault. How can you predict that Moana is going to react like that? If I had been there, she might not have. Or she still would have! It's going to work out man. I don't know what I'm gonna do. I have an idea. I'll handle Amelia. You handle the manatees, ok? What are you gonna do? I got this. Luis? Luis? Gracias. Luis? Elisa, hey, is Fernando in his office? No he's not. He's not? No, he's probably blowing off steam and we're all really disappointed the release didn't happen today. What? But my article is due tomorrow. Aye, he didn't tell you? He, I thought, he must have told you. Aye, Amelia, I'm so... Amelia! What are you doing? Working. I'm trying to figure out a way to salvage my career. The release isn't happening today. Elisa let it slip. So I'm just trying to figure out a new approach to this article. What about a break? I should stay here. I'm having trouble figuring this out. You know, my best ideas, sometimes come, when I'm doing something else. How about a distraction? I'm here to entertain. I don't need a distraction. I need some divine inspiration. Well, you won't find it here looking at all of this. I have read through all these materials at least twice. You could use some fun. Mama! Mama! Yara, I want you to meet Amelia. Amelia, this is my beautiful wife Yara. Amelia, so very nice to meet you. I've heard wonderful things. Nice to meet you too. And you've already met my little perrito. Amelia here needs some new island fashions. I would be delighted. Come, come. Thank you for the fun day. I needed it. So what now? I thought I would teach you how to surf. Oh, I should really get back to work. How about some street food? You must be starving. Thanks but I really need to check... Should we go check out some light salsa? There's a great band playing tonight in the town square. I really need to talk to Fernando. Find out when this release is going to be happening. Tomorrow. What? The release got delayed a day. I heard from Fernando that it's happening tomorrow. Oh, um, you sure? Uh, huh. Okay. Tomorrow. Tomorrow. Thank you for the distraction. Um, if you hear from Fernando tell him to call me. Okay. Okie dokie. Dude. I had to tell Amelia the release is happening tomorrow. You said there was a chance right? Well, you have to figure out what to do and... you owe me an ice cream. The front page? I went over all of the pieces and yours was the most compelling. So yes, you have been selected for the front page of Geographic Life's centennial issue. Thank you, Madeline. If your work is what I expect it to be, then it's all going to come down to that. I am putting a huge amount of trust in you. The whole magazine is. Are you up for the task? Absolutely, yes. Thank you for being honest about the release being pushed. It's going to make things a lot tighter but I have faith in you. I'm going to be checking in a lot more. It'll be good enough for the cover. I promise. And Brad's photos, hmm. Looks like he's trying a new style. But it's working. I like it. Gotta run. Amelia, the front page of Geographic Life is within your grasp now. Make it spectacular. Bye for now. What's gotten in to you? Oh nothing. Just that my boss told me that my article is going to be the front page story of the centennial issue. Oh, my dear I'm so happy for you. Can you believe it? I'm so excited. As long as I nail the release coverage the cover's ours. It sounds like you need a night out on the town. I should probably stay in and prep for tomorrow. Nonsense, you need to celebrate his achievement. You deserve it. By myself? On this island, you're never alone. You win. I won? You win. Thank you! Enrique is a local legend, you know. I'm impressed. Don't sound so surprised. Um, about today I, I should have called you. Yes, you should have. And I, about that... Listen, it's okay, as long as the release happens tomorrow we're all good because... the article is going to be the front page story. The... It's a great isn't it? See? Very impressive. Do you want to dance? Because I can dance. Come on, I'm Puerto Rican. You got it. Sorry! I might have talked a big game before. I'm more used to dancing alone. It' all right. I can teach you. It's a very basic step, okay. Start here. One and two. Back, three and four. Again. Now get your hips into it. Like this? Yeah, I think you got it. Come here. You got it. There you go. All right. Luis! Amelia, give me that camera. You can't dance with that much space in between you. He's right you know. Salsa is a dance of passion. Heat. Two partners connecting. I, uh, I want to show you something. What are we doing out here? Just wait. We are in Mosquito Bay, the brightest bioluminescent bay in the world. I thought this was all destroyed in the hurricane. Oh it was. But like Puerto Rico, the bay was resilient and it recovered. You ok? I'm just in awe at how beautiful it all is. Thank you. Time to go. You hungry? Starving actually. I'll head to the kitchen to see what we have. Meet me there? Sounds great. Okay. Oh, you look nice. Laundry day. You look great too. Wine? Yes please. Oh it already smells really good in here. I am making you Arroz Con Grandules, a classic Puerto Rican rice dish. Sounds great. I've never had it. Would you mind? There we go. Thank you. So what's in this dish? Very simple. We have rice, gandules, which are pigeon peas, olives uh, tomato sauce, spices and the most important ingredient sofrito. Okay, masterchef. How did you learn to do all this? Well, I was food prepping all the time for the manatees. I've figured I'd use that skill to feed myself. So I had Valeria teach me. Right here. And the last special step is to put the foil on the lid like this. And now we wait. Oh, what just happened? Okay good, the gas stove is still working. There are some candles in that cabinet. Wow, this looks delicious. Thank you so much. My pleasure. To unexpected adventures. Unexpected adventures. Wow, Fernando this is... I had a really good sous chef. Go ahead. I was just saying, I read some of your work. You're a really great writer. Thank you. Tell me, what's your favorite place you've ever been? Um, I would have to say here. You're just saying that. It's true. I love this place, don't get me wrong but you've been everywhere. India, South Africa, Australia. Yes, on my computer. Before now I had never left the mainland USA. Actually, more specifically, I've never left the east coast. What? The irony is my parents named me after Amelia Earhart but before this week, I have never even been on the plane before. You're joking. I swear. I don't even have a passport. Well, I must say I'm impressed. I would have never known after reading your work. Well, growing up my parents always wanted to travel the world but couldn't afford it. So they worked hard, saved up and now they're retired and seeing the world. They keep trying to get me to go with them but I'm always so busy with work. They must be proud of you. They are. What about you? Tell me about your parents. They passed away when I was young. Oh I'm sorry, I didn't... It's okay. Valeria practically raised me here in the villa. She was their best friend. They founded the center, you know. I knew they would have wanted me to take over when I got older but I just wanted to get off this tiny island. But after the hurricane, I came back to help Valeria. When I got back, I saw that the center needed help too so I volunteered. This is my home. You know? Well in my opinion, wherever they are they're proud of you. You think so? I mean it's incredible what you're doing. I feel honored to be writing about you. I should probably turn in. We have a big day tomorrow. Yeah, yeah. Can I help clean up? No, no, no I got it. Thank you for dinner. Listen, about tomorrow... It's gonna be great. I am in the middle of a good part. This can definitely wait. Are the baby manatees being released tomorrow, Fernando? No. You owe her the truth. She has lots of people counting on her. She was counting on me. Elisa was counting on me. You were counting on me. Me? I know you really wanted this to happen. I'm sorry I'm letting you down. I let you all down. No, no, no, no Fernando, it was not about the article. I want you to be happy. No one wanted this to happen more than I did. I hoped we'd be able to make it happen by tomorrow but it's just not right for them. You need to tell her the truth. What are you looking at? Do you have something you want to tell me? Do I? I know, Amelia, Brad came clean. He hasn't been there this whole time and you covered for him. These are the type of things that you need to tell me about. Don't ever leave me in the dark again. This is the front page of Geographic Life we're talking about here. Your career. I'm so sorry Madeline, it won't happen again. You have until end of day, tomorrow, to impress me with an amazing, inspiring, heartwarming story. No more surprises. Got it? Yes, I won't let you down. Because if you do, it will be a very long time before I trust you with another cover, yet alone your own column. Goodbye. She's right. No more distractions. Now's not a good time. Listen, about earlier... Fernando it's late... Amelia, please, it's really important. I have to tell you something. We should keep things professional. We have a lot of work to do. I'll meet you at the center tomorrow, okay? Yeah, me too. Fernando, the manatees aren't doing well today. They haven't eaten all day. That's not a good sign. Listen, I know we want to do the release today but we have to be realistic I don't think it can happen for at least another month. I know. It's my fault. I should have been there the other day supervising. We should have postponed as soon as that happened. Man, don't put this all on you. These things happen. Maybe she can come back when the time is right. Amelia! Amelia! Fernando Fernando. Yes, I will personally keep you updated on their progress. Okay we'll talk soon, adios. Elisa, take all my calls I have to go. Amelia, are you there? Please, can we talk? I can explain. Amelia, I'm sorry you had to find out this way. I tried to tell you last night but that's no excuse. All right, the other day Elisa ran a lift test to prepare the manatees for release. They got scared and I wasn't there. They just aren't ready. I know this means your article won't happen. I should have told you sooner. I'm sorry. Madeline. Madeline, it's um, the release isn't happening. Cheer up kiddo, I'm sure your boss will understand. Everything is a mess. I lost the cover, probably my job. My boss said we need to talk when I get back to New York. I just don't understand why Fernando couldn't be honest with me. I thought we trusted each other. Fernando couldn't bear the thought of disappointing you. His intentions were good, I promise you. I don't know what I'm gonna do. I shouldn't have come here. You know, a long time ago I spent a year working for a cassava farmer near the Amazon river. It was there that I met two marine biologists who were studying the Amazonian manatee. They became my best friends and ended up moving here when deciding where to set up the manatee conservation center. Eventually, they got married. They had a baby. Fernando? And now, of course, I care for him as if he were my own son. He is the greatest joy in my life. And none of that would have happened if I had just stayed home. Being out in the world is how we share unexpected experiences. Make new connections. Change our lives for the better. Like nature, we are all links in a chain and we need those connections to not just survive but thrive. It all needs protecting. Thank you, Valeria. Oh. Did this help? More than you know. Hello. Madeline, it's Amelia, look I know it's late but I've got something really good. Just give me one more chance. I promise it'll be worth it. Luis, hey I need your help with something. Good job, kiddo. Come here. Si, yes. Thank you so much. We will. Thank you, bye bye. What was that about? That was the World Wildlife Association. They want to talk to you about a potential sponsorship. What! Fernando! Fernando! Open the Geographic Life website right now. Come on! Links in the Chain by Amelia Day. Two orphaned, baby manatees, ready to be released back into the wild from a conservation center. That was a story I set out to Puerto Rico to write. The young manatees were rescued after the hurricane and have been rehabilitating in the conservation center ever since. Even though the manatees release has been postponed and they remain in the safety of the conservation center until they are ready. My world has opened up in ways, I never imagined possible. Oh my gosh. Puerto Rico has a rich ecological landscape. The mangroves. The coral reefs. The dry forests. Each system, seemingly separate, working together to thrive. I can't believe you did this. Me? I thought you did this. You know, when you asked me why I left everything behind and I said I had my reasons... It's really only just one... The black birds that live in the dry forest of Vieques, lay their eggs in the protection of the mangrove branches. The mangrove roots provide a safe environment for marine life and plants to grow. Manatees eat those plants and keep the seabed healthy. The manatees life isn't just about the manatee. It's about so much more. Each piece contributes to the next. Much like a game of dominoes. The same goes for all of us. As a very wise woman told me. We are all links in a chain. Connected. Even if you can't see those connections at first, they're there. Humming together in perfect harmony. And once we open ourselves up to these connections in each other, we open ourselves up to a world of unexpected adventures. We open ourselves up to love. Thanks mom. Yeah, tell Dad I love him too. Oh, my boss is calling I have to go. Okay, I will. Okay, love you, bye. That was a bold move. Risky. Totally changing up a story like that without sign off. It's that kind of daring and fearless attitude that would get you everywhere in this industry. Congratulations! Thank you Madeline. Your story's going viral. You're like everywhere. I think you're the breath of fresh air that geographic life needed. And with that said I'd like to offer you your own column. Really? There's a piece on sea turtles that would take you to Greece for few days. You'd be in charge of the whole shebang. You decide what you write. Just the more personal the better. People want to hear from you. Are you up for it? Yes, I'm ready to experience more. That a girl. I knew I could count on you. Thank you Madeline, this means the world to me. Well, you earned it. You said you were ready. Now let's talk about your flight back to New York tomorrow. Actually... I was wondering... Amelia. I, read your article. I know you're leaving tomorrow so I wanted to get you a little something. You glued it together? I'm not sure why but I thought it might mean something to you one day. Thank you, it does. And actually I moved my flight. I'm staying a little while longer. I can't believe I'm going to admit this but you have made me a better journalist. I was stuck before you got here but now I'm seeing the world with new eyes. You reminded me my dreams are possible and I'd like to accomplish them all, with you. I'd like to have more unexpected adventures with you. This definitely was unexpected. Do you hear that? Perfect harmony. How was breakfast? Amazing! It was good.
