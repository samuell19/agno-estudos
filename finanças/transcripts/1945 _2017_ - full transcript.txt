Presents written by production designer costume designer music sound editor producer director of photography director Dear listeners! IFS Friday, August 12, 1945, 11 AM... Here's the news: The war on Japan is being waged... with renewed strength. Today at dawn, Soviet troops crossed the Manchurian border. American planes dropped a second atomic bomb on Japan. The port of Nagasaki was hit. The Japanese government has ordered the eviction of all cities and continues to debate its options in the Council of Ministers. Millions of flyers containing the Soviet declaration of war were dropped on Japan. The Soviet declaration states that Japan refused the US, UK and Chinese demand to lay down arms thus rendering moot the Japanese offer to play the role of mediator... Mother... Please, get up. We should've been there a long time ago. (In Russian) Stop! Give me the hat! Give me the hat! Stop! Leave him alone! We've got two crates, Suba! Be careful! Relax. The kid knows what he's doing. Careful! I don't mind if it takes longer. Any goods coming in today, son? Not that I know of. I need you to drive me to the city. Are you crazy, Anna? On his wedding day? That girl was engaged to someone else not long ago. Let it go. The past is gone. - I'll go ahead then. - Go. Get dressed. I said get dressed! God bless, folks! Work going well? Hey! Jancsi! Come here a minute! Good that you came, Istvan. I need the land registry. We need to go to the office. Not a chance! We're not going anywhere, Jancsi! Today's the wedding. You are coming this afternoon? That why you came out here, Istvan? Not really. Actually... There are all these Russians here... Elections are coming up. I don't want chaos in the village. Times are changing, lstvan. You've been back only a week. You don't know what's going on here... I know what I know. Equality is a fine thing, but the Russians' world isn't for us Hungarians. We need a new world. A new world, Istvan! A new world! - What did they bring? - Dry goods, perfume, stuff like that. - Perfume? - Yes. Hello? Operator? Connect me to the Town Clerk. I don't understand. Hello? I need to go into the village. But Stationmaster, what about the train? God bless! Could I see the delivery notice? Stationmaster, the whistle! Blow it yourself! You picking up, or just delivering? Just delivering. Take it nice and slow. Don't rush the delivery. It's special cargo. SLOW! Nice and slow. I need time. WW; C'mon! Give me a minute, I'll just check on them. Here's the dear bride's mother. Good day, "Uncle" Istvan! "Uncle"! She's a grown up now. She certainly is! A fine day to you, folks! Karoly, old boy! - You're doing well? - We wish you the best! - We're going to have a good time later! Drink up! Brandi, my boy! A fine day to you. Brandy. Let's have that brandy. - I'm not drinking without Jutka. - Come here. She's been up since dawn. Everything alright with your son? Where are the kids? Where are the kids? The kids should join us. - Come on. - Here she is. I expect you'll wear a different dress to the wedding. There's not enough brandy. We want more. How much were you thinking? Don't worry, you'll be well paid. Wouldn't mind getting paid in advance. - Climb on the wagon. - We'll walk. - How far is the village? - An hour's walk. Slower! Slower! Slower! Slower... - Oh, that's strong! - Alright then. More? Another round! We'd like another round. - That's enough. - Let me give this girl a kiss. May I? If we can't have another round, let's get back to work. Give it here. Jancsi... Went down the wrong pipe, Arpi? Will you be at the wedding? It's nothing to do with me... How's it going, Jancsi? What is it? Brandy too strong for you? Or have you lost your nerve? Don't be scared of a little peasant girl. Be hard on her at first, until you've got her tamed. Good day. Where to? - I'll just have a look in here... - No, you don't. Let him go, Officer! He can't go in! Pal, old man! Leave him alone. Let him come. Let the veteran come in.

Why'd you come here? - We have to give it back. - What do you mean? We have to give it all back. - Don't be silly. - The Pollak family sent these people. - They'll find out everything. - Calm down. What makes you think they have anything to do with the Pollaks? Bandi, go home and have a drink. Go on now. You know if there's a problem, I'll fix it. See you at the wedding feast. Then, in the name of Social Democrats... You have no business here. Matyas Rakosi, Hungarian Communist Party leader, spoke of current political problems. Hungarian democracy... ARMIN POLLAKS PHOTO ALBUM Arpad! Open up! Where are you? Hey! - Where the hell were you? - Back in the storeroom. There are 2 Jews in the village. Supposedly they brought perfume. The Pollaks? E. But the Pollaks might have sent them. - And then? - And then what? And then what? Relax. You want to give up already? Was I the one who wanted all this? Have you lost your mind? It's too late to call off the wedding. You should be grateful Arpi's marrying you. Y! Good day. Good day. Good day. How did that sewing machine get here? Your husband arranged that too. Thank you. Good day. Am I disturbing you? No, I just tried it on one last time. You don't like me, do you? I love my son. I'm going to love your son too. You love the drugstore. Come on! Kick it over here! Come on! - Have you eaten? - Yes. They're here. Do you hear me? - They're here in the village. - I know. So? Your son died a hero on the front. You've got two other sons. They issued us the house legally, didn't they? What if the Pollaks come back too? Gimme that brandy. They gave us papers for it, the Town Clerk himself. - You and your Town Clerk. - Oh, please... You can do what you want. I'm not leaving this house! Nor are the kids. Put that brandy down! Leave it! I said, put it down. You've had enough! Kw.! There are other places you could act like a man! Please hurry. He's got a wedding in 2 hours. - Thank you. - Good-bye. - Good-bye. - I'll be back in an hour. Are you nervous? I think he'll be done in time. I didn't mean the suit. I've got a bad feeling. Hey! What are you doing here? The office is closed. Nice bike. What makes you so high and mighty? Kissing the Russians' ass? I was looking for the registry. That's none of your business. Will you take me for a ride too, sometime? Down the poplar lane? What would you like, Jancsi? - I'd like some tobacco. - Give him some, son! - And a glass of champagne! - Champagne for a peasant, Istvan? - Bit of a waste isn't it? - It's a new world. Master or peasant, it doesn't matter... Right? ...as long as they're Hungarian. Well? Have a nice day! - Good day. - Good day. Get over here! Andras wants to return the house. I know, may his mother be damned! He won't listen to me. I'll convince him. You talk to the women. I have to tell you something. Your father made me sign the accusation against Pollak. That's why they took him before the others. If they're back, you should know. What did Kustar want? You know very well! What do you know? You couldn't even get a girl for yourself! I got you exempted from military service. Cost me a fortune, so you wouldn't have to go and die on the front! Now you're talking back to me? - I arranged all this too. - I'm giving the store back. No you're not. No you're not. Your damned mother! You won't give it back. We're not just going to give back what's rightfully ours? We've got papers to prove it's yours. You're about to leave? - Where are you going? - I don't know yet. To Budapest. You think you're better than me? God bless. Hey! What are you doing? Where are you going? What the hell do they want? Revenge? To show off the goods all over the village? Go on! Go! Go! Go! Watch them! Follow them! Report back if you see anything! Understood. Father! It slipped. Careful! Didn't you close it? Damn it! Shove it back! Did anything fall off? Hello, who is it? Hello, Operator? Szentes here. Connect my wife. Connecting. What are you doing? Where are you going? Budapest. Paris. America. God bless you. It's me. Connect him. What do you want? Lock the door. If anyone knocks or raps, don't open it. They're right in front of the house. They have perfume and cosmetics. In bulk. Maybe they're trustees. Maybe Pollak had a will... Or he sold the house again. But then the contract's invalid, and there can't be a new owner. I said, there can't be a new owner. Damn it! Gee-up, go ahead! Are we moving again? We're not going anywhere. This place is ours. Everything here is ours. If anyone asks: this stuff isn't here. The Germans took it. Or the Russians. It's not here, understand? Where are you taking those rugs? Be quiet! What are you doing here?! Get out! Out! Well, Kustar? What brings you here? - I've come for confession. - Now? Now. Do we have to do this now? There's a wedding today. I confess to the Almighty Father, and to you in God's stead, Father. Since my last confession I've committed the following sins... I'm listening, son. Have you heard, Father? - What? - They're back. There's two already in the village. What makes you think the others are coming, too? What do you want to confess, son? The house, the furniture... Go on, son... Don't you understand, Father? They issued you that house, didn't they? You have the deed. You've suffered enough. The Town Clerk and my wife... - Have you been drinking? - They made me sign the accusation. You dare come to God's house drunk? Answer me, son! You don't want to understand either, Father. Go home. Say 10 Hail Marys, 10 Our Fathers. Sleep it off. And don't come before the Lord drunk again. This is where they prayed. That other building over there, is where they studied. Rozsika. We can't start a wedding like this. We can't. They'll bring trouble to us. You're talking nonsense... Two days before they were taken away... Krausz's wife came to see me She begged me. Offered money if I would hide her son. The younger one. I made space for him behind the firewood in the shed... I didn't even tell you. But the last night... ...before they were all taken away, when they were all in the temple, the gendarmes came. They knew what to look for. What did you do? I was scared. I think we still have things to do here. Did you hear? They're going to demand everything back. The stuff Weisz gave me for safekeeping is in the cellar, in locked trunks. I only spent what he gave me to keep his things safe. - They're welcome as far I'm concerned. - And what should I do? The house you were issued is yours to keep. Give back the rest. But I've got 2 other kids. From how many fathers? Fucking bitch! Is something wrong? Carry the trunks in. To the front there. Hello, ma'am. Hello, ma'am. What are you doing here? Aren't you getting ready? I've come to see Rozsi. I'd like a word with her. What's that suitcase for? - Is something wrong? - I'd like a word with my fiancÃ©. We have to leave this village. I want you to come with me. Now? The train leaves at three. Get going! I can't go anywhere. Because of Jancsi? I asked you: because of Jancsi? I'm not going anywhere, understand? - Is that your final word? - Yes! Get out! - You're leaving? - Yes. - Where to? - Far away. - And the wedding? - It's not happening. God bless! - What happened? - He left. Everyone's already at the church. I'll die of shame. To my health... Brandy. The whole bottle! I've got money, don't worry. You think ...I'm the only one that's guilty? You won't get away with it. No one will get away with it. Not the Town Clerk, not the Priest. No one's gonna get away with it. This... ...even you won't get away with this. Time to go home now. - Get up, Bandi. - Just hold on... Bandâ€œ Come on, then! Let's go! He's yapping in the pub, in front of everyone. Have you lost your mind, Bandi? Blabbering to everybody? You'll only be fucking yourself over if they get hold of this paper! It has your signature on it! And now haul your ass home. Sober up, before you get into real trouble. Look, father! What are those? Dig- Where is he? Where's the kid? Gone. Where? Where? He left. That's that. Because of you. Aren't you gonna hit me? Hit me. At least then you'll touch me, not just your whores. You're sick. Sick... You're a murderer. Disgusting worm. What are you talking about? You watched from there. You stood at the window. Didn't even wait for them to take him away with the rest. Your best friend. You made Kustar sign the accusation And Iharos was your witness. You think I don't know? How would they know? You stood there when they took the others away too. They'd have taken Pollak anyway. You didn't know that when you denounced him. Are you mourning your lover? I never had a lover. You're the one who's sick. Yes, it's me. What are they doing? I'll tell you later. Let's not stare. Good day. I'm the Town Clerk. What's the nature of your visit, if I may ask? We've come for a burial. Just a burial? Just a burial.. Who are you burying? What's left of our dead. As the village magistrate, let me express my deepest sympathies. Thank you. I personally guarantee that we will forever preserve the memory of the victims. Step aside, folks. Let them pass. We'll take you to the station. We'll Walk. And the trunks? Mother! What are they staring at? Have him taken down. Spare her that. Come! Kustar's dead. Fire! People! There's a fire! There's a fire! Come help! The drugstore's burning! Stay! The drugstore's burning! What are you staring at? I said, there's a fire! What have you done? - Put it out! - This? Put it out! Get a bucket! Bring buckets! Put it out! Hurry up! '-! Faster! New passengers, tickets please... New passengers.
