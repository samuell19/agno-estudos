That's right, folks, looks like yet another sweltering night in the Music City. Temperatures are expected to stay around 85 degrees for the duration of the evening. Tomorrow doesn't look to be any more forgiving, with highs expected to reach around 100. So, crank that AC, grab a cold one and settle in for a hot, sticky evening, and not the kind you'd like, either. Prostitution is up. Crime is up. Taxes are up. Wages are down. The only businesses which seem to be flourishing are the strip clubs and bars which have, on the average, reported net profit increases by 18 % just this past year. Really says something about our society, doesn't it? The city definitely seems to have its priorities in order. - No, please. - So, this shit gets pretty boring, huh? - Yeah, what shit is that? - You know. This shit. This kinda ain't nothing going on around here kinda shit. - Ain't nothing going on, yet. - Yet, what, do you know something I don't know? I know life. - Hm. You know life. So how come there's a cop like you still pounding the beat, huh? You don't want like a cushy desk job or something? Pushing pencils and shit? - Nah. That's not for me. I worked for DEA years ago and some of them good ol' boys, they gave me a hard time, you know? Started busting my chops. I decided that I could do more, more use on the streets if I was out there protecting families. Protecting my family, protecting your family. - That's cool. I get that. So, how long you been married, Andy? - 15 years. 15 amazing years. That's cool. Got any kids? - Yeah, I got one girl. 10 years old. Marissa. What's your wife's name? - Liz. Amazing woman. Met her years ago when... Met her in a bad time in my life, you know? She's my rock. I wouldn't be anything without her. Wouldn't be here. - So, saw all those medals and awards down at the station. How many you got? - Seven. Lucky seven. - That's cool. What'd you get them for? - Medal of Honor, Medal of Valor, Bravery, Integrity, Purple Heart, a Combat Cross, and Fitness. - Fitness, huh? Yeah. You got a problem with that? - Look, now first you start talking about life and, I mean, that's weird, but it's cool. Then you're gonna sit there, tell me that you won an award for fitness. - Yeah. And? - Fitness. Oh, fitness, my ass. Sitting there all muffiny busted biscuit ass. I thought I was talking to Yoda. It's more like goddamn Jabba. - Fuck you, you goof. Head to the station, we're about to check-in for the night. - And Mr. Scarpelli don't want no more lip from ya. So pay up by Thursday, or he's gonna snap your little fucking neck! You got that? - But my daughter, she's real sick. She's got some kind of medical condition the doctors are trying to figure out and I just need a little bit more time. - Time is something you ain't got. Capisce, you fuck?! But just one more week, okay? One more week and I'll hand Mr. Scarpelli every cent that I owe him. - Look, we'll give him the message, but he may have us give you one instead. - What are you talking about? - He means that A, Mr. Scarpelli gives you a week, or B, we return with a rusty blade and saw off your kneecaps. - Slowly. - And you won't know which one until it's too late. So, I suggest you head on over and make peace with your sick daughter while you still have the legs to do it. - Mr. O'Hannon, are you okay? Can I get you a towel? No, I'm good. - Those guys are just terrible, and with your daughter being sick-- - I don't have a daughter, you fucking moron! - But I thought that you said that she-- - Look, stupid, calm your tits, all right?! Look, just go inside and get me a beer or something, if you think you can handle that without blowing a fucking head gasket. I need to think. - Okay, Mr. O'Hannon. - Yeah, hey, Joey. Yeah, it's Nicky. I... Yeah, I'm gonna get that to you real soon, okay? I've been having some car trouble lately and... No, no, that wasn't because of car trouble last week, okay? That was because of something at the club. Now, look, I... I know. I know, Joey, but, look, look, look. I got a good tip for the race tomorrow night, okay? Yeah. Black Flag to place. Yeah, I know what the fucking odds are right now and we could make a fortune! Look, I just need you to spot me two K. Come on, Joey. Well, one K, one K. Jesus Christ, Joey! 500! I know that. Look, I can pay you back everything that I owe you after we win tomorrow night. I just, Joey? Hello? Fuck! - What's going on, Captain? What's wrong with everybody? Why is everyone acting so glum? Is it Steinman? Did he eat the last of the jelly doughnuts again? - There was an accident, Andy. - What kind of an accident, Captain? - In my office. - What kind of an accident? In my office. - No, you tell me right now, goddammit! What kind of an accident? - Was a botched robbery. 10th and Hargrove. Shots fired every place. Your wife and daughter, I'm sorry, Andy. They're gone. - Please tell me you nailed that motherfucker. Please tell me you got that son of a bitch! Is that him? What the fuck?! Shit! Fuck off me! - Enough! Andy, you need to take a week off. Effective immediately. - But, Captain! Motherfucker-- - I said immediately! Put your piece and your shield on my desk. - Heard that right, the Chalupacabra. Hm. I wonder, does that tastes like chicken? In local news today, Sergeant Andrew Rotelli is making the headlines yet again. But while filing charges against Sergeant Rotelli doesn't seem likely, the city, the police department, and the mayor's office all seem to be pushing to have every medal and honor ever bestowed upon the once promising police officer rescinded effective immediately. The master of the macabre-- - Fucking bullshit! - The Fellini of fear. - What's up, Ace? Nick? - Who else? - I thought you were dead. - Yeah, not dead, but it ain't for lack of trying by the entire fucking world. So, you gonna invite me in, or what? Yeah. Yeah sure. Come on in, Nick. Come on. Wow, hey, how'd you find me? - I followed you home from the service yesterday. Hey, I'm sorry about the wife and kid. Goddamn niggers. - My funeral? Nick, how'd you hear about my family? You live half across country, no? - Are you kidding me? Mr. Superman Officer, I mean, reduced to a joke for the tabloid headlines. You're their golden ticket, Ace. A fucking golden ticket for the vultures. - Ace, wow, I haven't heard that name in years, Nick. Seems like a lifetime ago. - Yeah, it was. You know, it was a different time, different place. We took different paths, but they both led back here anyway. It's funny how that works, huh? - Yeah, that's, how come you didn't come up to me at the funeral, though? - Way too many blue shirts around, you know? Me and the fuzz, we don't mix. We got a history, you know? And I just kinda felt it was in my best interest to lay low. Well, fair enough, but, like I said, I thought you were dead. - Nope. Not dead. Just my dreams, Ace. I'm sorry to hear that, Nick. - Yeah, well, look, it's no biggie. It's why I came here, really. I mean, I thought maybe we could fire up that old partners-in-crime flame once again, you know? Just like when we were kids. You know, not giving a fuck, caring even less. We had some good times back then, didn't we, Ace? - Oh, we had the best times. Too many to mention. But we were crazy kids back then, Nick. Nothing more. - Yeah, we could do it all again. Just like before. - "Just like before"? Again, Nick, we were kids. We were crazy and young, and we've grown up a lot. We've wised up a lot. And what are you getting at anyway, Nick? - Come work with me. Run the Pleasure Dome with me. I mean, we could own that fucking town, huh? Two peas in a pod. Just you and me. - You flew halfway across the country to come here to ask me to run your strip club with you, Nick? Is that what you're telling me? Nick, I'm a cop. - Wrong. You were a cop. Now, you're nothing. You're shit. Or at least that's what the system wants everyone to believe, anyway. I mean, you give 20 fucking years of your goddamn life to keeping the city clean, and for what? I mean, you get a big promotion? No, you get the big "fuck you, Charlie," you know? The system is fucked, Ace. - The system, no, the system works, Nick. - Yeah, maybe for the niggers, the spics, the whores, the junkies. It doesn't work for guys like us, you know? You know, the system is probably gearing up to remove you from it altogether. - So, what do you propose, Nick? - Beat them to the punch. Quit while you've still got some dignity, while you've still got some semblance of that tough little fucker I grew up with on the streets all those years ago. I mean, you've got nothing left, Ace. Come run the Dome with me. - I don't know. I don't know, Nick. That whole thing, that ain't me anymore. - Oh, and this is? I mean, laying in front of the boob tube in your own shit, right? I mean, hell, I could come in here a couple weeks from now and it'd look like a goddamn episode from the Hoarders. A dead little animal in the corner, a urine-soaked diaper on the floor. - Fuck you. - So what do you say? - Six months, Nick. If it ain't happening in six months, I'm on a plane right back here. - It'll be happening. - It better. - Yeah, come on. Let's get you packed. - Busy night tonight, boss. It's a good one. - Good, we gotta keep those horny fuckers coming back night after night, putting those butts in seats. These clothes ain't gonna pay for themselves. Lou brought some new friends with him. - Oh, Lou's here, huh? Well, is he behaving or are we gonna have to toss him out again? - He's in his seat. Hands to himself. - Hm. Fucking change, huh? I get tired of babysitting that crusty pervert. - He's being a perfect gentleman. I promise you. Go inside, see for yourself. - Oh, you can bet that I will. I hate that motherfucker. - Nick, why are you always giving that guy a fucking hard time for, huh? I mean, he goes in, drops a little cash, grabs a little muff, goes home, no harm, no foul. - I don't need his fucking money. - Oh, you don't need his fucking money? You haven't seen our last few bill statements, have you? You don't know what our electricity bill is, and not to mention our car. - All right, I don't need a play-by-play, all right? I get it. We're broke. - We're not broke, Nick. Just wouldn't hurt to line our pockets for a rainy day. - Rainy day. Whatever. Is Jade here? - She got here about 20 minutes ago. She's upstairs getting ready. - Is that fucking asshole, Julio, with her? - Oh, yeah, he's here, and she's sporting a really good shiner. - Fucking son of a bitch. - Motherfucker, I'll go check on her. - Nah, I'll do it. Go talk to Lou. Tell him I said hi. Lou. Fuck. So, I see you've spawned yourself off into other little scumbags. - Nicky, baby. This is Charlie, Bob, and Dennis. We're just celebrating the closing of a huge deal. Come join us. - No thanks. - Come on. Let bygones be bygones, huh? Here. Take some champagne. It's the good stuff too, not that watered-down piss you sell here. What'd you do that for?! - Look. We are not friends. We've never been friends, we're never gonna be friends. You got that? - Look, pal. I don't know who you are, but Lou's just trying to be nice. - Look, pal. I'm the owner of this fucking club and you better find yourself some better acquaintances, asshole. I'm watching you. One false move and I'm gonna snap your dick off. You got that? Sweetheart. Make sure you charge him a corking fee for that. Jade, you back here? You okay? - No problem, Andrew. No problem at all. - July. What's going on? - Not a thing. Nothing going on here. Yeah, right. - Really? Well, enlighten me. What was it I supposedly did this time? - Oh, you know what you did? - Do I? - Yeah, you do. Black eye sound familiar? - Oh, that. Andrew, it was the damnedest thing, man. She turned the corner of the apartment, slipped, and caught the edge of it right in her face. Right here. - Yeah, I'll bet. - You could imagine my relief when I found out she was okay. Could have been so much worse. Uh-huh. Is she up there? - Find out for yourself, Andrew. Jade, can I come in? - Yeah, of course, Andy. It's okay. It's okay. What happened here? - Well, you know, just another run-in with the door when I was texting. - The door, huh? How many times you gonna let that gorilla put his hands on you? - It's not his fault, Andy. He had a bad day at work and I said something I shouldn't have. - Yeah, like what? "What do you want for dinner?" You know, you don't have to stay with him. You can go. - Where would I go? My mom disowned me after I started working here, my sister's somewhere tweaked out on God knows what. I have nowhere to go. - There's places you can go. You have options. You can stay with Melanie, or Ola, or Maria, or any of the girls. - I can stay with you. - You know it's not an option. - Why? 'Cause you're married? It's been over a year, Andy. They're not coming back. You have to move on at some point. - In time. - Well, there's no time like the present. - In time. - Okay, well, in time, I'm running out of options. - You could always stay at Nicky's. Childhood sweethearts back together again. - Yeah, as soon as I find one of those iron panties with the big ass lock on it, I will move in back to Nicky's. - You okay? You gonna go on? I could get Vanessa to cover your shift. - Nah, I'm good. - Sure? - Yeah. It'll be good for me to get my mind off it, anyways. - Well, I'll see you out there in a few, okay? - Okay. - All right. - Thanks. - Bye. - Ooh! Yeah. Come here. Gimme that. Give it to me. Ooh, yeah! Ooh! - How do you like it, you fucking spic?! Huh?! You bitch! Nick, Nick, Nick, get off him! Get off him! Leave him alone. He's not worth it. Hey, this ain't fucking over, man! You got a fucking hurting coming like you ain't never seen before, bitch! Bring it, you son of a bitch! Drop it! Leave him alone. Get a fucking drink. Move on. - Good evening and welcome to the Pleasure Dome! Guys, what's the difference between anal sex and a lap dance? Shit, tell me! I wanna know. - A lap dance will make your whole night. Anal sex will make your hole weak. Aw, come on, that was good. All right, next up is Lucy. She's so wet and juicy. Let's give it up for Lucy! - Woo-hoo. Yeah, baby! Shake those money makers! - Careful, buddy, you're gonna spill my milk. You know how I hate that. - Aw, man, relax. There's plenty of milk right there. - That's just gross, man. Come on! Most of these girls are single moms in a bad place. - I know, and I'm a big supporter of single moms. In fact, I'd like to support this one right here. - Hey, hun. You okay? I can go back out there for you. I can even give you the tips. - No, I'm good. My body might be broken, but my spirit is not. - Well, if it's any consolation to you, your boy Nicky just introduced Julio to his right hook. - Nah, he's not my boy anymore. - He still loves you, Jade. - He's got a funny way of showing it. - And Julio doesn't? I'm sorry. It's none of my business. I just worry about you, you know? You still have the key to my apartment, right? - Yeah, I have it. - Well, mi casa is your casa. However that goes. So, if you change your mind, gimme a call. Okay? - Goodnight. Hey, was Nicky hurt? - Nicky. Nicky's always hurt. What about you, though, what's with that Bruce Lee kick of yours? - I'm fine. I offered Jade to stay with me, but she didn't seem up for it. - Well, we'll keep an eye on her. - Okay. Right, well, I'll see you tomorrow. - Yep, have a good night, sugar. Be careful cutting through the cemetery. Okay. No, please! - Do I think there's soap in that glass? Of course not. But he's a customer, a regular, paying customer, I might add. Go get him a fucking drink. Now, what? - You know what that fat fuck did now? He threatened to call the Alcohol and Tobacco Commission on us 'cause our license is expired. - Who did that? Lou? Man, Nick, you know he loves just to push your buttons. He's just fucking with you. I checked it a while back. We're good. Don't worry about it. - Well, one of these days, he's gonna push the wrong fucking button, and when he does-- - And what? What are you gonna do, huh? Shut the fuck up and get a drink. - Oh, this is funny to you? Well, I got a surprise for that walrus. I took a shit in his car 10 minutes ago. - You did what? Man, Nick, you're a fucking wild card. That's why I love you. - Fuck. - Detective Francesco. Good evening. What brings you out this fine night? Business or pleasure? - It's never a pleasure when I'm dealing with you two fucking maggots. - Then, why the fuck did you come here? - Vanessa Rayne. Is she one of your fucking girls? - Fuck. - Jesus Christ. What is that? A knife? She okay? - Yeah, she's fine for right now. - Can we see her? - No, she's been heavily sedated, so none of us can see her right now. - Who would have done this? - I don't know, O'Hahn, or O'Hann, whatever the fuck your name is. You know, you're making a lot of friends around town lately. You know that, right? - Oh, fuck you. - Really? Well, the people you're dealing with right now are pretty dangerous and pretty damn creepy. So, everybody that's around you? They're not safe. - Oh, that is bullshit and you know it. - Really? Well, right now I have nothing. No clues. I have no possibilities. I have a city of bullshit. So, fuck you. - When can we see her? - In a few days, when she's better. I'm watching you, buddy. I got my fucking eye on on you. - Smarmy little shit. - What the fuck was he talking about, Nick? Are you getting involved in some shit, again? I thought you were over all that crap. I am done. I told you that already. - Because if you're involved with it, I'm involved with it. We can't fucking do that anymore! - Relax, Ace. I told you I'm clean. - You better fucking be. - Botched robbery. Your wife and daughter, I'm sorry, Andy. They're gone. - Hello? Yeah. Okay, Francesco. Okay, thanks. We'll be there soon. Oh, hey. Listen. Whatever you do, please keep her awake. Don't let her fall asleep. Okay. Okay, good. Thanks. - Well, you are welcome. Looks like you got the deluxe treatment, baby. - I told you I didn't wanna do it right now, Nicky. I'm on my period. - You know what, you may have come in on your period, but you are leaving with an exclamation point! - Ugh, fucking asshole! - Hey, remember to clean up those dishes in the kitchen out there before you leave. This ain't a fucking barn. What's up, Ace? Good timing, you caught me in my downtime. Francesco just called. Vanessa's awake. - She's awake? Did she say anything? You know what I know. 10 minutes. - Okay. - Andy. Nicky. - Hey, sugar. How you doing? - Fine. Seriously. - Like I was dropped from the Empire State Building. - Well, you just keep taking that medicine and you'll be back to work in no time. - I'm not coming back. - What do you mean you're not coming back? - I mean, aside from being a scarred up freak, I'm lucky to be alive. Been given another chance and I don't wanna waste a day when I get out. - Vanessa, listen-- - No, Andy. It's okay. This is what I want. The attack really put things into perspective for me, and I'm gonna start living on my own terms. - Well, the club always has a place for you. You're like family. You know that. Thank you. - Okay, I understand about this little lovefest, but there is a brutal slasher out there that I need to catch, okay? So-- - Go to hell, Francesco. - Really? In a hospital? Get away from me. All right. Do you know anything about the attacker? Do you have any idea? - No, I'm sorry, Detective. Nothing. - Now, I know he attacked you from behind. So, did he smell like something, or did he say anything? - He may have mumbled something faint. Something about revenge, but-- Revenge? I can't really be sure. I'm sorry. - Revenge. Okay. All right, well, you know how to get in touch with me. I know how to get in touch with you as well. All right, I've got something going now. Thanks. - So, is there anything you wanna tell me? - Like what? - Oh, I don't know about the sick son of a bitch who has it out for you?! Revenge?! Really, Nicky?! I thought we were fucking done with this, man! - Look, we have been over this and over this, all right? I am not the guy. Turn the fucking page already! - Watch it, Nick. - Oh, when did YOU become so fucking self-righteous, huh? You know what? You forgot where you came from long ago, Mr. Big City Detective, poster boy for rubbing elbows with those same very people that threw us into juvie all those years ago. Not once, but multiple times. You were just like me, Ace. Or does it pain you to remember that? - Oh, I remember. Why do you think I became a cop? I didn't want to become like a-- - What? Like a fuck-up like me? Is that it? - You said that, not me. - Yeah, well, how'd that cop thing work out for you, huh? Cleaning up the city, couldn't even protect your own wife and kid. Motherfucker! - Do it! Do it, huh! You angry?! You want revenge, maybe?! Huh?! You lost something, Ace. When Marissa and Liz died, you died too! - But you don't know how it is to lose-- - What? To lose someone? A wife? Kid? A sister, maybe? Yeah, you forgot all about Danielle, didn't you? - Oh, I didn't forget about her. I loved her! - No, I loved her! And it was my job to be watching her, not playing fucking stick ball with you! If I hadn't turned my back for that one minute, she would have never gotten into that van. - Oh, Nick. Nick, you can't beat yourself up for that, man. - Our parents? They divorced just before Christmas. I guess that's not my fault either, huh? They never could even look at me the same way again. You remember. They found her missing her hands, her head. Crime went unsolved. So, revenge? Revenge is a feeling that I live with every fucking day of my life, so don't you talk to me about revenge. - I'm sorry, Nick. Fuck. This shit is just gaining on me, man. - It's gaining on all of us, Ace. - This is absolutely horrible. How could anyone be enjoying this? Get her off the stage. You gotta be kidding me. Can we get somebody else up on the stage, for God's sake? Jesus. - Hey, what's your problem, buddy? - My problem is I come here after work looking to see some titties and some boom boom, and to get away from this. - So? - So, today I come down here to spend all my money, and it's like feeding time at the fucking zoo! - Why don't you take it outside, my friend? - Yeah, head on down to Club Sugar Bush, all right? They have fresh cesarean scars down there, asshole. Get off me, man. - Dick. Hey sugar, did he hurt you? No, I'm okay. - He didn't touch you or nothing? You know, we got signs posted about that. - He tried to a couple of times. I just moved. - Greasy scumbag. Where's Jade? - She's in the back. - Well, we saw Vanessa. - And? How is she? - Well, she's not coming back. - She's scared. I mean, she's happy to be alive, but she's scared. - Yeah, I don't blame her. - Yeah. - Who would do something like that? Did she have any enemies? - Well, that's what we were coming to ask you. - Me? Why me? - Because you were friends. - Well, friends, but work friends. We never hung out. - So you have no idea who this could be? - I have no idea, Andy. I'm sorry. - Well, that's great. Just fucking great! - Whoa, what's eating him? - Life. Don't worry about it. - Okay, well, I'm almost done here. Wanna get some coffee and talk? - Yeah, lemme go check on Nick, and meet me outside in 10 minutes. - All right. - Just a routine surprise inspection. - Are you fucking kidding me? Don't you dykes have anything better to do than to come around here and harass us? - Listen here, you bald headed little fuck. - Easy. Settle down. - Yeah, calm down, Charlene. Or your little girlfriend's not gonna let you in bed tonight. - Fuck you, dipshit. - I said enough! Look, if I could just see your most recent license renewal. - I'll get it. Don't be killing everybody when I leave. - Well, you finally got me where you want me. Let's let this threesome begin, huh? - Ugh, in your dreams, O'Hannon! - Is this behavior really necessary? Mm. Look your panties are all wet with anticipation. - Fuck you, it's too early for this bullshit. I don't wanna be here either. - Then, why the fuck are you? - Okay. Everything checks out. You're up for renewal again soon. Don't forget. - Nah. Just curious, who called you on us this time? - You know I can't say. - Yeah. You can tell us, it's not gonna leave this room. Was it Lou? - It was Lou. - That fucking guy. I knew it. - You know, he's not such a bad guy. If your partner weren't such an asshole, you might actually get along. - Yeah? Well, if you were twice as smart as you think you are, you'd still be stupid. - Fuck you, dickhead. Look, you and your little butt buddy here, you better watch out. You never know when a surprise inspection will show up. - Get the fuck outta here before I stick my shoe so far up your cunt, no one will be able to retrieve it. - Whatever, asshole. - All right, guys, let's give it up for the next girl on stage, Trixie! Trixie is also a carpenter. She knows how to work your wood. Go to the bar and get hammered, and then come see Trixie to get nailed. And remember, you saw it here at the Pleasure Dome. All right, guys, get your hands out of your pockets and into your wallets, and give it up for Trixie! Make it rain! Make it rain! - So what exactly do the police know? - Not much. Random attack. They're just dismissing it as some nutcase loose in the city. - Okay, and you don't agree? - I don't know what I believe anymore. Why? What's that supposed to mean? - Well, Francesco seems to think that Nicky is somehow involved in all of this. - That's just ridiculous. He would never do anything like that. - Not that, he's just thinking that someone he's wronged or has been indebted to might be responsible. Mm. - When you guys were together, what kind of shit was he involved with? - You know Nicky. I mean, he was into gambling here and there, but nothing hard or dangerous. - And you'd know, right? I mean, you guys had a thing. - A "thing"? I'm not a whore, Andy. No, we were dating. Like a real couple. - I'm sorry. I didn't mean that, I just... He fell for you hard, and then you broke up with him and-- - I dumped him. So, now I'm a whore and a heartbreaker. Yeah. - This is coming out all wrong. - What are you trying to ask me, Andy? - Maybe the breakup was his breaking point. People get sent over the edge. I'm just saying. - No. I mean, Nicky, he's crass, he's crude, he's pretty much an asshole, but nothing like that. - I know. Fuck. Just wish we knew what was going on. We could be one step ahead of this motherfucker. - Agreed. - Woo-hoo! It's open. What the fuck are you doing here again? - I told you to watch your mouth, O'Hahn. Didn't I tell you that? - Fine. What? - Another one of your girls were killed. This time, in the daytime. - Shit. Who was it? - Cindi Thompson. - Fuck! - What's going on? - Cindi was killed. - Cindi? Oh, my god. - What happened? Same street? - No. This time, somebody broke into her house, and she was in the kitchen. That's where she was attacked. - Definitely the same guy, huh? - Well, yeah. It seems to be 'cause it's so much of a coincidence. I think it is him. - That's great, aren't you supposed to protect and serve, huh? Great job doing both-- - You know something, I will take you downtown and check you for everything. You know, I'm sure we missed things in the past. But this time, I'm sure we wouldn't mind checking everything because I'm sure we don't like to waste taxpayers' dollars doing shoddy police work. Detective, he doesn't mean anything. He's just, he's emotional. We all are. - I mean, I had just talked to her after her shift. - Well, did she say anything on the phone? Like she was afraid or anything? I mean, anything different? - Didn't say anything, she was just gonna go home, get changed, and get ready to go out on a lunch date. - With whom? - Franklin. I don't know his last name. - Well, who's this Franklin guy? - He's some nerdy fucking guy at the club. We all know him. Right, Nick? He's a good guy. - Well, good guy, but what do you know about him? I mean-- - Nothing. I mean, he's a really nice guy. He's a true gentleman. He really is. - All right, well, I'll be back in touch with you guys when I have some more information. Better watch your ass. Bye, guys. - Nicky, what the fuck's going on already around here? - Yeah, Nicky. Come on. Is it someone you know? - This fucker is playing with us. - Think. Is it somebody that you know? Somebody that comes into the club? A girl? - Really, Jade? I mean, you of all people? You're gonna blame this on me too? - No. Nicky, it's not like that. I'm not blaming. - Oh, the fuck you say! I mean, come on. First, it's Andy and now you? You really are two fucking peas in a pod, aren't you? - Settle the fuck down, Nick. Come on, we're just trying to cover all our bases. - Haven't you been fucking paying attention? All right, look. You know me. You both know me. Don't you think if I had that information upfront, I would have said something long before our girls started getting chopped up like Thanksgiving hams? - Nick, listen, listen. - "Covering all our bases," huh? Is that what you call trying to brainwash my girlfriend so you can get into her pants? - You know that's not the case. - Yeah. Whatever. Whatever. I mean, it's totally obvious that you two have raging hard-ons for each other. Everybody sees-- - Oh, fuck off, Nicky. - Been there, done that, sweetheart. Fucking knock it off! How is this helping us?! We're no closer to finding what's going on. - Hey, you know what? I'm sorry. I'm sorry, Nicky. I just... He's right. We've known each other for a long time. We've been friends since grade school. If there is something going on, just tell us. Okay? We're here to listen. We just have to make sure that we cross all of our Ts and dot all of our Is. - Nick, it could be anybody. We're just trying to figure out our options here, figure out what's going on. Now, listen, I mean, gambling? Some fucker cut you off in traffic? I know it's not drugs. You gotta be straight with us, Nick. We need to know what's going on. - That's just it. There is nothing. I owe a few yards to the mob, you already know about that. But other than that, I mean, I'm clean. I've been clean. All right? This whole situation, this is not good. - "Not good," what are you getting at, Nick? - No clues. No motives. No notes. I mean... This thing's far from over. - No, no, no, no, no, Monica. We cannot afford all day security patrol! Well, what am I supposed to... You're on in less than two hours, Monica. What... Damn! - Evening boss. - Okay, this sucks, Andy. With these recent attacks, I can't get anyone to come to work. I mean, they're scared. And I'm having a really hard time filling those private rooms. - Well, you can take Monica off the list because she just fucking called and canceled for tonight. - Monica, Monica. Oh, shoot. I was counting on her. What did she say? - "What did she say," what do they all say? "I'm not feeling well. "I twisted my ankle. "My dog's not feeling well. "I have no gas in the car." She's fucking all over the place. Fucking broad. - Hey. Now you're starting to sound like Nicky. - Well, maybe that's not such a bad fucking thing, right? I mean, it's about time we start stirring some shit up. This status quo is not fucking working. - Okay, I don't like where this is going. - I'm serious, Jade. We keep trying to keep pace with this psycho fucking killer who's always one step ahead of us. We're the fucking victims here. - Okay, I don't know what you're talking about. Please, just try. Jesus Christ. What's going on over here? - Andy, the voice of reason. Look, speak to your friend here about the price of scotch and keeping the customers happy, huh? Last time I ordered a Penicillin, which was about a month ago, it set me back seven and a half. Now, it's nine. Scotch went up. - Scotch went up? Huh? That's no answer. Andy, reason with the man, would you? He said scotch went up, Lou. - Well, I ain't paying it! Take my 7.50 and let's stop this dance! That drink is nine bucks. - Yeah, for the other yokels, maybe. Huh? Put 7.50 on my tab and now let me drink in peace, huh? - Okay. Eddie! - Hey, hey. Hang on a minute. Hey! Hey, hey, hey! Hey, Andy, Andy! - Get him outta here! - Andy! - See you, Lou. - Jesus Christ, you're as nuts as your fucking friend! Hey, get outta here, you fat pig! - Fuck you! Jesus Christ! Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. What was that all about? - Eh, fucking good riddance. That pig had it coming. - I can't believe I'm hearing this from you. Lou was a regular for forever. - Nothing's forever, Jade. - You're being an asshole. Just like Nicky. A cold-hearted asshole. You two deserve each other. I'm done here. - No, wait, Jade. - Don't fucking touch me, okay? I am sick of your fucking pity party, and I don't wanna be around when he brings you down to his level, okay? When you get your head straight, you know where to find me. - What the fuck is her problem? - Oh, you're such a fucking asshole, Nicky. Shut the fuck up. - Story of my fucking life. Initial reports claimed Israeli jet fighters bombed a guerrilla base, killing at least 49 soldiers and 13-- - Okay, first thing, you better have my fucking money. Two, you better have a good reason for not having your ass home, bitch. - Where is she? - Well, hello Andrew. Rather late, isn't it? How are things at the club? - I asked you a question. - And I asked you one. What do you want? - I wanna know where Jade is. - Well, I was wondering that myself. And you can bet she and I are going to have a discussion about that as soon as she gets here. - If anything fucking happens to her, you're fucking dead. I mean that. - Oh, are you threatening me, Andrew? Is that what you're doing? - Nothing better happen to her. - Whatever you say, Andrew. I'll fucking handle Jade. Sweet dreams, honey. Fuck you. - Fucking asshole. Nicky? - I am so sorry. It's so late, but I am really worked up over this whole mess and I didn't want to go home. I didn't have anywhere else to go. So, what, was Andy unavailable? - Oh, my god, Nicky. Why are you such an asshole? This was a mistake. - No, Jade, don't go. Look, I... You're right. I'm an asshole. Come sit down. Can I get you a drink? - Just water is okay. Thank you. What did I do? - Stupid. How long you got? It's a long list. - Look, Jade. It's gonna be okay. We're gonna figure this out. - I'm scared, Nicky. But, I'm here. - But you're not. You haven't been here in years. - Oh, that's not true. - It is true, Nicky. What happened to you? What happened to us? - You walked out, Jade. - Yeah, because I couldn't take it anymore. The gambling, the drugs, the booze, not knowing if you were gonna come through that door again. But I always did. - No. You didn't. That boy from 110th Street that I fell in love with was gone. - Jade. You know-- - I know. I know. Your sister's death. You've used that excuse over and over. At some point, you have gotta stop blaming yourself for that. - Changed me. - It changed all of us, Nicky. But we dealt with it and we moved on. We didn't let it consume us. You just, you just frigging gave up. - I didn't give up. I grew up. My priorities changed. - Yeah. And after all of those years of us being there for each other, I was no longer one of those priorities. - I never stopped loving you, Jade. - I wish I could believe that. I really do. - I know, I probably didn't show it that often, but you'll never know how much you meant to me. How much you still mean to me. I mean, the excitement of holding your hand. The little glance without having to speak a word. You know what? No matter how fucked up I got, you always had a way of bringing me to peace with myself, and for that, I will be forever grateful. Yeah, Andy. What's up? I think I may know who it is. Be ready in 10 minutes. - Mm, okay. Yeah, okay. - What is it? Everything okay? - Yeah. Andy's got an idea. He's gonna come pick me up. - Oh. Great. I'll come with. - No. Look, don't take this the wrong way, but it might not be the best timing to let Andy know what happened here tonight, you know? - Yeah, you're probably right. - Yeah, so, you just go home and I'll call you if anything pans out. - Okay. - So, you really think that it's that guy you beat up in New Jersey? Right? You know how crazy that sounds? - I know. I just, I have a feeling. - So, what, he followed you, he watches you for months, he sets up the attack on the girls, just to make your life a living hell for popping him a couple of times? I mean, come on, Ace. - I know. It's crazy. - Yeah, it sounds impossible. - Okay, Sherlock. You tell me. I really think it's someone we know 'cause he sure as fuck knows us. - Well, exactly. But that's what those stalker fucks do, right? They stalk. I mean, hell, for all we know, it could just be some pervert from down at the club that creamed his jeans one night watching the girls, and now he wants to pay for the dry cleaning. - That ain't funny, Nick. - Yeah, and I'm not laughing, okay? I'm just trying to figure this shit out. - How? - Well, I'm going through different scenarios, right? I started thinking about maybe it being some guy that we knew. So, after you and Jade had your little spat earlier, I called our accountant, had him pull receipts for the last year. Wanted to look at cash, charge, see if anything jumped out. - That's pretty good work, Nick. - Yeah, well I'm not a complete fuck-up. Anything stand out? - Not really. There was the regular customers, couple of business guys, that fucker Lou, but, I mean, no red flags. I'm just really starting to think that it's just some nut job that targeted the club. I mean, it's fucked up, but it happens. - I guess it happens. Anything can happen. I don't know. - Exactly, we don't know. So we just gotta keep our eyes and ears open. He's bound to screw up sometime. - But when? We're running out of time. The fucking club is running out of girls. - July? Julio, are you home? Oh, my god. - Hey, who the hell let these guys in? - It's okay. It's okay. - All right, so when you came home, you came into your bedroom, you found those photos, right? - Yes. - Anything else? - No, I just saw that message and then I called you. - All right, so you didn't see anybody outside, lurking around, looking around, or being suspicious or anything? - Actually, Detective, this is not her house. This belongs to somebody she's dating named Julio Sanchez. - Sanchez. Where can I find him? - I don't know. He wasn't home when I got here. Maybe he's at work. - Work. Snake. - The hell do you mean by that, O'Hahn? - Well, it means he's not really known for his white collar, upstanding community service in this town. - So, where's his former employer? Where's his employment at? Where's he at? - He's a scumbag delivery boy down at Daxton's Market. - You mean on Main and 8th? - Yeah, that's the one. - You don't think that he's a suspect, do you? I mean, this is his home. He couldn't have done this. - Yeah, well, I mean, it would make sense. He's got easy access in and out. - No, I don't think he did this. He's an asshole, but he didn't do this. - What are you talking about? - He thinks it's some guy that's got it out for him back in New Jersey. - Oh. Wait a minute, do you mean where you got fired as a cop? - That's the one. - Hey, Miller. Do me a favor. - Yes, sir. - Get ahold of the Trenton Police Department and find out if they got any more of their collars you can get ahold of, all right? - All right, yes, sir. - Appreciate that. So, now, back to the situation. Now, no one tried to break in? You sure there wasn't any glass broken or doors lifted, or anything like that? - No, and that's what's so odd. It's because the photo that he used was a photo of us, taken recently at a camping trip, and those photos I had hidden in my closet under a bunch of stuff. So, there's no way, unless somebody came in here and totally ransacked the place that they'd find those. - All right, well, we're gonna take a look in that closet. Here, I wanna see where you kept those photos. Put these gloves on. I don't want other fingerprints. Do me a favor, Connelly? Will you come in here and dust for us, please? Yes, sir. - Shields only, man, all right? - It's okay. I'll call you later, okay? What was all that about last night? What are you talking about? - What am I talking about? The hug? - Nicholas. Andrew. So you finally get to sleep last night? - Fucking Julio. Been a long time, Julio. You feel good? - Yeah, feel really-- - You okay? Fuck! Get your fucking hands off me! - Yeah, bet that's exactly what the girls were saying when you were carving them up. Isn't it, Julio? - I don't know what the fuck you're talking about, man. Yo, man. Let me go! - You like cutting up pretty girls, you sick fuck, huh? - I don't know what the fuck you're talking about. Yo, get off me! - Yeah, staging break-ins at your fucking house to throw the cops off? Fucking brilliant, Julio! - Break, what? Break-in? What happened, is my shit okay? - Your shit? Shouldn't you be more concerned with Jade right now? - Yo, man, fuck that. That bitch hasn't been home all night. I went to find a party of my own. She can kiss my ass. - You really are a piece of shit, aren't you? You don't even care that she's missing. - Not really. I'd find her, man. She always comes back. - You wanna know where she was last night, motherfucker? Huh? Smell that, that's where she was last night, huh? - What the fuck you doing, Nick? Where'd you get that? Is that the fucking gun from the club? - Yeah. - You're fucked in the head! What's wrong with you? Gimme that shit! This is for protection only! The fuck, Nick? - Hey! Knock it off! Rotelli. O'Hannon. You back away and go home. Mr. Sanchez, we'd like to speak with you for a moment, please. Yes, officer. - I'm not fucking playing. If I find one more mark on Jade, you're fucking dead. Whatever's gonna happen to you in jail is nothing compared to what I'm gonna do with you. - Blah, blah, blah. Same old story from last night. - I fucking mean it, man. No more. - All right, well, maybe you could just take her place and suck my dick. Motherfucker. Night, boys. Fuck that motherfucker, damn! Fuck that motherfucker in the truck. - So, what did Julio mean about that "same story as last night"? - You first, what about you and Jade last night? It's nothing. - Yeah. I'll bet. - Look, she was scared, all right? She just wanted someone to talk to. - Yeah, talk. Sounds like there was a lot more than talking going on last night. - And if there was? I mean, Christ, we got bigger things to worry about right now. So what was that with Julio? - Don't worry about it. - Look, have you been harassing him? 'Cause if you've been harassing him, we don't have a case. - I said forget it, Nick. - Oh, yeah, "forget it," whatever. Andy knows best. - Yeah, sometimes I do. Shit. You know, the turn was back there. - I didn't miss anything, Nick. The club is back there! We ain't goin' to the club, Nick. - Then where the fuck are we going? I said, where are we going? Are you still pissed at me over all this? - I damn sure know that you and Jade have been hiding something. How do I know you're not hiding anything else on me? - Look, I have told you, all right? I'm not to blame here! I have been straight with you. - Maybe, maybe you have been. But you know what, I need to keep it straight in my head, Nick. - What are you talking about? - We'll be taking a little ride. We're gonna go see Scarpelli. - Scarpelli?! You fucking nuts?! Taking me to see Scarpelli is gonna be like dropping a sheep into a lion's cage. He's gonna eat us both for lunch. - Not if you come clean with him! Level with me, Nick! - I have told you, all right?! I owe him some money. I've been paying him. That's why his goons haven't been coming around the club lately, all right? I got tired of taking fucking headers into the pavement! You know what? Fuck it. Fuck it, take me to the greasy wop's place, all right? Let's just get this over with. I'm tired of the suspicion, let's just get this shit done. - Where do you think-- - Get the fuck off me! - Boys, boys, boys. This is not necessary. Andy, Nicky, sit down. Join me. Sit down, please. Came. Him. Okay, boys. What can I do for you, today? - I suppose you've heard what's been going on at the Dome. - I don't watch the news. Catch me up. - Some psycho's been carving up all our girls. - Ah, the mad slasher. Damn, this is a crazy world we live in. How many girls has he taken from you so far? - Enough that the other girls are afraid to come to work and the customers have stopped coming in. - That's bad for business. That's a shame. - But especially since he seems to have it out for the two of us. - Revenge? - Oh, yeah. Revenge. But you wouldn't know anything about that, would you? - No. No. No. Ah-ah. Do you know who this might be? - We have our suspicions. - You don't think I would be doing this, huh? - Well, Nicky does owe you guys a little seed, and we figured that... - You figured that I was sending a message by carving up little girls, right? Gentlemen, I am a businessman. Okay? And this situation between Nicky and I is that. Strictly business. Okay? If I want to be persuasive, I have other ways to make my meaning, okay? Besides, Nicky's been a good boy lately. He's been paying on time. I mean, I'll be able to send my grandchild to Yale, maybe, maybe Harvard, you know? Yes. I know. It's a good place. I like it. But I'll tell you what we are going to do. We're going to put the word on the street and, if we hear something, we'll tell you. So, right now, you're going to go because I have a meeting. Okay? Oh, and, boys, if you ever burst into my place again like you did a minute ago, you won't walk out. You'll be carried. Do you understand? Now, go. - You see, I told you it wasn't Scarpelli. I've been paying him and I've been paying him on time. And besides, he doesn't want to get involved with us. He's got other things going on that he wants to stay out of the spotlight for. Nah, it's gotta be somebody who know us, you know? It's gotta be that fucker, Julio. What's so funny? - It's not Julio, Nick. - And how can you be so sure? - 'Cause I'm a cop. - You are not a cop. That doesn't mean shit right now. - Oh, no? Trust me. He's not the guy. - And why do you say that? - Because of the way he acted back there at his place. Plus, the cops would've figured it out by now. What, you don't think that they've investigated us and they've looked into us? Our friends, our families, our employees? Their families? Come on, Nick. He's not the guy. Trust me. - So, why did Francesco string us along, then? I mean, why did he keep asking all those questions to Jade about Julio like he didn't know anything about him? - 'Cause that's what they do, Nick. They try to break you that way. Julio's not a suspect, Nick. Trust me. One of us are. Motherfuckers. - Yeah, I know. Yeah, big time, and we need to figure out what we're gonna do fast, and if the cops aren't gonna do it, we need to take it upon ourselves and do something. - Yeah, what do you got in mind? - I don't know. I think better at the office. Call Jade. When she's done with Francesco, tell her to get her ass over to the club. She should be in on this as well. - Okay. What on Earth is going on? The cops cleared Julio about an hour ago, and now we're back to square one. - She's right, Ace. I mean, we can't have another week like we had this time. We won't have any girls left! - I know, I know. I just need to think. - Okay, with all due respect, Andy, we need to be done thinking, okay? This psycho could be planning his next move. We need to do something. - We will. Dammit, just be quiet! I need to think! - Think about what?! Okay, we're just sitting here waiting to be picked off. - I don't think that's gonna happen. - For fuck's sake. I mean, I have told you, I am not the guy. Oh, I know that, Nick. - Nicky! Nicky! Why? - Why what, Jade?! What?! You think I was thrown off the force for beating up a perp at the station? Really? No, that motherfucker worked for me. I was a rookie cop 20 years ago, got on the force with a new wife and a young child on the way. The cops paid shit. I had to take a few extra side jobs. I had to make a few friends, which weren't necessarily the best friends, but they were friends. That fucker worked for me. It was a deal gone wrong, and I covered my tracks. - But Vanessa, Melanie? Why would you do that? We were your family. You're sick. - Sick? - Yeah. - No, Jade. Smart! You know why? 20 fucking years I spent on the force, protecting people from the scum of the Earth out there, and what do I get in fucking return, huh? Huh?! I get some fucking psychopath that guns down my wife and daughter, gets arrested, and eventually gets out. No no no. I'm not fucking crazy. I'm right where I need to be. Somebody had to fucking pay. - And that's how you respond? Is by attacking and hurting innocent people? - Innocent? Nobody is fucking innocent. Someone had to go down, and I didn't care who it was at this point. I needed a fucking outlet, and you know what, Jade? I got one. Put the gun down, Andy! - Detective. How poetic. - Put the gun down. - "Put the gun down." Not gonna happen. - Nobody else has to get hurt. - Yeah? Why don't you tell that to my wife and daughter? Look what happened to them. - Well, now it's time for healing. Come on now, Andy. I can help you, man. Trust me. - Can't help me. Don't fuck with me, Detective. You know what they do to cops on the inside. Fuck that! - You know, Jade, you know why he got really kicked out of the station, right? Shut up, Francesco. - He really wasn't kicked out. What actually happened was they allowed him to stay on the force as long as he took psychological things. But he failed them, continuously. From the captain at Trenton PD, I got everything together. He gave me all the files, I saw all the paperwork. He did a lot more stuff than at that damn station. Okay, now, Andy, this can go easy or hard, you know? We can stop the madness right now. Come on, put the gun down. - Yeah. I'll let it go. - Sorry, Ms. Johnson, but Andy actually was on our radar, you know? He was one of our prime suspects, but we just didn't have any pieces to put it together. - So, what finally gave him away? - How we figured it out was that he was always so kind and friendly. He always wanted to be there to help us. And most people who would do that usually are the ones that are bad guys. So, I put everything together and that's how I found out it was him. - Yippee-fucking-hoo. You figured it out. Does somebody wanna call me a fucking ambulance, or something? - Oh, come on, man, that's not that bad. You'll be all right. Don't worry about it. We'll get somebody here to help you out. He's actually a nice guy, Ms. Johnson. Bit of a pain in the ass, but he's a good guy. - Thanks, Detective. - No problem. Here. Take my card. If you ever need me again, please gimme a call. - Okay. - How's that feel, buddy? Hurts, huh? - How's it going? - Busy night, people buying drinks. No complaints. - Yeah, I mean, how are you doing? - I'm making it. - I gotta go. I gotta go prep the girls. They have a lot to learn, those newbies. - Miss you already. Oh, god. - So he says, "$100? "How much for the whole thing?" - Lou. - Hey, Nicky. Want you to meet my friends Dax and Desmond here. We're just here celebrating a big closing. - Welcome to the Dome. - Listen, O'Hannon. All bullshit aside, I just want to express my heartfelt condolences to you and Jade about Andy. It was so tragic. I know you guys were childhood friends, and it must be rough. - Well, thank you. I appreciate it. - Hey, sweetheart, let me see my tab, huh? We may want another bottle to celebrate. - Not tonight, Lou. Tonight, it's on the house.
