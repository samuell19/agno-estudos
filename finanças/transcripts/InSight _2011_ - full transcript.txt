(dramatic orchestral music) (siren wailing) - We got vultures circling here. Lacs to the neck, chest, hands, shoulder, take your pick. - [Man] How many times was she stabbed? - [Man] She's lost too much blood. - Jed! Need a large bore IV, stat! - Neighbors watched it happen, and no one even called the cops. We did what we could, but-- - Does she have a name? - Allison Parks. - Okay, Allison, stay with us. - Gonna have to jump her. Gimme 360. - Charge 360. (whooshing) Oh, my god. - He loved me. - Wait a minute. She's trying to say something. - [Doctor] Clear! (defibrillator thudding) (grunting) - Kaitlyn! Kaitlyn! (heart monitor flatlining) You all right? - He loved me. - [Doctor] Clear. Kaitlyn! (gasping) - Where is she? - [Nurse] Oh, thank God. - What happened? - Shit, Kate, your heart just stopped, that's all. Hey, hey, hey! Take it easy. You've taken some punishment today. (sighing) What the hell happened in there? - What do you mean? - Well, grabbing a patient in the middle of an ICD? You have a death wish? - No, she was lucid. She was awake. - Who? - The girl. That girl. Did she make it? - Let's just worry about you, okay? - She was responsive. She was scared to death, but she was responsive. - What are you talking about, sweetie? - She looked right at me. She spoke to me. She was trying to talk to me. She was trying to tell me something. - That girl had been stabbed over a dozen times. You have any idea how much blood she lost? She couldn't have said a word. - No, no, she, she spoke to me. She was trying to tell me, I think she was trying to tell me who stabbed her. - Honey, that girl was dead before she ever came through those doors. (eerie ambient music) (siren wailing) (helicopter whirring) (suspenseful orchestral music) (siren wailing) (camera shutter clicking) - So, let me guess, no witnesses, right? - 14 witnesses watched it all go down. - Watched it? What do you mean, "Watched it?" (siren wailing) Did you get statements? - Heard a scuffle, they looked out the window, and they watched a little girl get stabbed like they was watching television. Here's the best part. No one bothered to call 911. - Well, that is just wonderful. (camera shutter clicking) Do me a favor, will you? Grab some shots from the windows, looking down on this area. - [Man] Sure thing. - So why would no one call the cops, huh? Tell me that. - Listen, man, I find that fact a bit depressing, but not us. - 14 people means 14 witnesses. Somebody saw something. - Best I could get was a vague description. Male. Race unknown. Black jacket. Maybe a blue baseball cap. - And not one person caught a glimpse of the perp's face? - It's too dark out here. - How long's this lamp been out? - I don't know. It's a good question. - Well, do me a favor, will you? Go ask somebody. Thanks. - [Canto] Started off to be such a great day. - Kate! Whoa. Kaitlyn. - What? - Where do you think you're going? You're still in shock from the defib. You need to rest. - No, I gotta go home. - Hey! You can go home when you've been released. How many times have you had the same conversation with your own patients? - I, no, I have to go home and take care of my mom. She can't be without me for this long. - I'll check in on her. Just tell me where I need to-- - Val, I'm going. I'm sorry, but my mother needs me. - How's she holding up? - Well, uh, they gave her six weeks, and six months later, she's still here, so there's that. - Look, take the next couple days off, okay? I'll cover for you. Go be with your mom and rest. I mean really rest. And call me if you need anything. Anything. - Thank you. - Oh, and say hi to your mom for me. - Okay. (dramatic orchestral music) (siren wailing) (suspenseful orchestral music) - Ma'am? Ma'am! Are you okay? - We got vultures circling here. Lacs to the chest, hands, neck, shoulder, take your pick. - How many times was she stabbed? - She's lost too much blood. - Jed! Need a large bore IV, stat! - Bunch of neighbors watched it happen. No one even called the cops. We did what we could, but-- - Gonna have to jump her. Gimme 360. - Charge 360. - He loved me. - [Doctor] Clear! (gasping) (sighing) (dramatic orchestral music) - What's wrong? - [Kaitlyn] Nothing. - You look tired. - You're one to talk. - Don't be stubborn. Tell me. - It was a nightmare. That's all. Everything's fine. - You know, you don't have to sleep in that chair every night. - It's fine. - It's not! The chair is no good. That is why you're tired. Now, you have your own bed. You should use it. - Swallow. - You know, I just worry about you. - Don't. - Something is troubling you. Now, I may be sick, but I'm not stupid. - It's a patient. Died yesterday. She was stabbed to death. It was bad. I'm sure she suffered. - I'm sure you did everything you could. - No, I didn't. I couldn't do anything. I looked right at this girl, Mom. I looked right at her. And she, she was looking back at me, like, into me. Like she wanted something. Like she wanted me to do something. Like she was trying to reach out, and-- (glass shattering) (gasping) - Heavens. Honey, just let it go. It's all right. (kettle whistling) - We're at the scene of a grisly murder of a local woman where police have made no arrests at this point, and they have few leads. The attack appears to be a mugging gone wrong. The tragic tale of a desperate criminal who falls upon an unsuspecting victim in a dark and somewhat isolated location. - No, that's not right. - Allison Parks was simply in the wrong place at the wrong time, and unfortunately, random crimes such as this are fairly difficult to solve. - [Kaitlyn] I can't stop thinking about that girl. - Yeah, I know. It was horrible. But the cops'll find the guy, I'm sure. - No, they're giving up. - What are you talking about? - They're not even looking in the right place. - And you know the right place? - Well, whoever killed Allison knew her. - Whoa. Allison? - She said, "He loved me." - Okay, do you hear yourself? You're not making any sense. - She told me. - That girl didn't tell you anything. She was dead. - Okay, so, what? You think I'm hallucinating? You think I'm just making all this up? No, I don't. - Look, honey, I know you, okay? And you always want to believe that you can help, but sometimes we do everything, and it's just not enough. - Yeah. - We do what we do, okay? Let the cops do what they do. Come on. (suspenseful orchestral music) - Allison? Allison, is that you? Oh, Jesus, Mary and Joseph. You look just like her. I thought I was seeing a ghost. - [Peter] So, what'd you find? - Whole lot of nothing. - Well, nice work then. - Gave witnesses a bunch of baseball hats to look at. It's pointless. - What about the knife wound? - Nothing conclusive, but the lab said the wounds, and I quote, "Were consistent with a large kitchen knife, "possessing precise serration, "approximately six inches long." - Yeah? Yeah, that'd do it. - I like the part about precise serration. Precise serration. It's like the lab guy is going shopping for a wedding gift. - So, what? Some tweaker? He tries to sneak a couple of bucks out of this girl? Is that what happens? Then she starts screaming and he just flips out? - He's got a big ol' knife and he uses it to shut her up. (dog barking) - [Shep] I don't get a lot of visitors. - Thank you. - Still can't believe she's gone. Tragedy. How did you two meet? - School. - Oh. Classmates. - I heard there were witnesses. Did you see anything? - I, uh, no. Are you, are you hungry? I could heat up some frozen dinners. - But your window is, it looks right out onto the courtyard. You didn't see anything? - Uh, uh, I was out, like I told you. But I heard all about it from the couple in 3E. Horrible. I just, poor Alli. Just screamed and screamed and screamed. Nobody should have to hear that. (dramatic orchestral music) - I don't understand. Why didn't anyone call the police? - It was so awful. So loud. Everybody figured someone else, surely, would call the cops, you know, after all that screaming. That's what happened, must've been what happened. Everybody just thought the same thing. That somebody else was gonna take care of it. It's not that hard to understand, really. - I thought you said you weren't here. - I wasn't. - So what if more than one person called the police. Every single one of you should have been calling the police. - What do you want from me? - Sorry. I'm sorry. It's just, the police, they think it was random, that it was a mugging. - Yeah. - Yeah, some crackhead. Do you believe that? - If that's what they say. What do I know? - I'm just trying to make sense of all this. I don't understand who would want to hurt Allison. She said something to me about, um, about a man in her life. Someone she cared about. Does that ring any bells? - Listen, I've explained all this to the detective. I barely knew her, all right? She was my neighbor. Seemed like a sweet girl. I wave at her, in the hallway. She gave me the keys to her apartment so I could go in and water her plants when she would go away with her boyfriend. That's it. - Her boyfriend. - [Shep] Yeah, scruffy kid. Artsy type. But he may have been around for months. - What's his name? - You and Allison were close, and you never talked about her boyfriend? - I've bothered you enough. Thank you so much for the coffee. I'm gonna, I should go. - Oh, oh, wait, wait, wait. We're just getting to know each other. I can't send you back out in the cold. - No, really, I should take off. - Let me make us some dinner. I have some frozen dinners I can warm up. You like brandy? - No, but you know, I wouldn't say no to a glass of water. - Oh, that's no trouble at all. Like ice? You want ice, sweetheart? (suspenseful orchestral music) - Ow. (voices vocalizing) (water running) (suspenseful orchestral music) (breathing heavily) (grunting) - Hey, you all right? - Where is he? - Who? Where is who? - The guy with the knife! Where is he? - Who? - The guy, where'd he go? - There's nobody here. Okay, how about we try this again? I am Detective Peter Rafferty, and you are not a friend or relative of Allison Parks, correct? - Correct. - Did you know Miss Parks? - [Kaitlyn] No. - But you have a perfectly good reason for snooping around her apartment. - I was one of the nurses on duty when she came in. I was there when she died. - I'm gonna call that a no. - I didn't take anything. I was just looking around. - Looking for what? - Anything. Somebody has to find out who did this. - You're right. Someone needs to find out. I happen to be the lead investigator. - I saw you on the news. Didn't exactly inspire any confidence. - Ma'am, crimes like this are fairly complicated, but the system works. Given enough time, the bad guy always gets caught. - You believe any of that? I'll call that a no. Whoever did this, Allison knew her. She told me. - Miss Parks told you? - She looked at me. She looked right at me and she said, "He loved me." It was the last thing she said. Yeah, I know, I'm just some nurse, but I don't think that's something I would say if my attacker was some random crack addict. - Ma'am, the hospital said that she died in the ambulance. - That's not, no, that's wrong. - Well, actually, right here. "Despite all efforts, I was unable to kick-start her heart." That's what it says. - Well, sometimes there are discrepancies. - Between alive and dead? - She was alive. - That's fine, ma'am. Go on, please. - This wasn't a mugging. Whoever killed Allison knew her, loved her. - If you have any evidence suggesting that there's some sort of conspiracy-- - Even if the hospital was wrong, which is highly possible, considering how badly they screwed up on my tonsils, even if, I mean, "He loved me" could mean anything. It could mean a puppy she had when she was nine years old. - No, look, that's not it. I know what she meant. - [Peter] So you went to her apartment? - Yeah, I felt like I had to help her. Somebody has to. - Why were you running? - I, I thought I saw someone. - You thought you saw someone in the apartment? - No, Well, I, look, it was dark, you know, and I probably just got spooked. And, this is gonna sound really crazy, but it was like I was imagining the murder through her eyes. I was there. And then, you showed up, and it was gone. - Just out of curiosity, are you currently using any psychiatric drugs? - Go to hell. - "Just out of curiosity." That's real subtle. - It's not like you weren't thinking it too. - Miss Monahan. Kate. Hold up, please. - Are you arresting me? Because if not, I'm gonna go home. - Look, I am sorry about Detective Canto back there. He's a good cop, just not always known for his tact. - Well, whatever. Forget it. - Take this, please. If you remember anything, anything at all, or if you just wanna talk, feel free to call me anytime. You know, I'm not the bad guy here. (sighing) - I don't know, it's hard to explain. It felt like I was really there. - But it was just like your imagination, right? - I don't know. I mean, it felt so real. - Do you hear yourself? - Yeah, I do. - Your brain was hit with enough voltage, I'm just glad you're not talking to trees at this point. - Thank you. Thanks. - Hey, I don't understand what you were doing in the girl's apartment in the first place. - This is Allison's boyfriend, and I think I know where I can find him. - You took this from a crime scene? - The cops aren't doing anything. Nobody's doing anything but me. - Maybe I could help you schedule some time up on the 4th floor. - Oh, my god. - I didn't mean it like that. - Listen, Valerie, I don't need a stupid shrink. I need somebody I can trust. I need somebody who believes me. You're my best friend. - Kaitlyn, you need to drop this before you get yourself killed. - [Mom] Katie? - Sorry, I'm running late, Mom. It'll be ready in about 10. (suspenseful orchestral music) (glass shattering) (suspenseful orchestral music) Mom, are you okay? Mom! Mom? Oh, God. Mom! Listen to me. Listen to me, Mom. You're having, listen to me! You're having an allergic reaction. Just stay focused. Please stay focused on me, right now. I need you to calm down. Breathe. This is epinephrine. Watch. It's adrenaline for the swelling. You're gonna feel a little pinch, and you're gonna be fine. All right, try and slow down your breath. Slow down your breath. Mom? Look at me. Look at me. Breathe. Breathe. (breathing heavily) There you go. Good. There there there. (dramatic orchestral music) Oh mom. It's okay. You gotta stop scaring me like that. - What would I do without you? (sobbing) - Allison was taken from us suddenly, and without warning. Her death was random and heartbreaking. It should remind us all to cherish the short time we have upon this earth. Today may be filled with sadness, yet we take comfort in our knowledge that while Allison's body has passed on, her soul remains with us, now and forever. Her memory provides us with strength and guidance. Now, please, may we bow our heads in silent prayer. Let us pray. (bells tolling) (suspenseful orchestral music) (tires screeching) (cars honking) - Who are you? - I'm, it's-- - [Man] Are you a cop? - No. I was there when Allison died. - This is where we used to come and hang out all the time, listen to tracks I was working on. I'm a DJ, so-- - You know, Allison said something right before she died, and I'm just trying to figure out what it means. - What did she say? - "He loved me." She said it like she couldn't believe this was happening to her. Like somebody she loved really betrayed her. - I don't know who Alli was in love with, but it sure as hell wasn't me. - How long had it been since you talked to Alli? - Months ago. - Really? That long? - Yeah, Alli and I, we dated, but that was like, six months ago. And we didn't talk since then. Alli was a mess, and she started going through depression a year ago, and-- - She was depressed. - Yeah, well, who isn't, right? I don't know. She started seeing some quack doctor. I don't know what they talked about, but, I don't know, we started fighting all the time. You know, she started blaming me for shit. For crazy shit. I just couldn't take it anymore. I ended it. - You ended it? - Yeah. I mean, Alli, she was cool, but she was out of her mind. I just bounced out of there and I never looked back. - Do you know if there was anyone else in her life? - No clue. That's between her and God. And that shrink. - Do you know his name? - Doctor, uh, Bennett or Barrett. I don't know. She just always called him "Graham." - Thanks. - Why do you care who killed Alli anyway? - Somebody has to. (dramatic orchestral music) (car alarm chirping) (mysterious orchestral music) - He loved me. (light buzzing) (screaming) (screaming) (light buzzing) (screaming) (woman vocalizing) (gasping) (sighing) - Go on. - Oh, um, sorry, I lost my train of thought. - It happens. - I don't remember what I was saying. - It's okay. Sometimes we lose track of what we're talking about. Our memories, we get caught up in them. - It was really vivid. - You were talking about your mother's illness? - I was? - Mm-hmm. - My mother? - Yeah. - No, I don't think so. - You wanna hide from this. I know. It's okay. It's painful. But trust me, it'll hurt less to keep talking. - Yeah, I don't think so. - [Graham] Did you give up your apartment when she became ill? Mm-hmm, yeah. - Why? Because it was easier? To live with her while she was undergoing her treatments. - Look, I don't need a pity party here, okay? I made choices. - But like you said yourself, you're all she had. - No. What do you mean? - You gave up your own life to take care of her. How does that make you feel? - That's not why I'm here. I love my mother. This isn't about her. - Happy birthday. - What is this? - [Canto] Another day, another body. - No, no, no, no. Give this to Gehrke. Come on. - I can't. Reed put this on us. Didn't even say pretty please. What? - Something's not right here. - How about we take a case we can actually solve? - There's something this nurse said that just stuck with me. - Maybe it was her pretty blue eyes. - Oh, and this looks like just a random mugging. Maybe too much. It's like the attacker did everything humanly possible to make this look like a case-closed mugging gone wrong. I don't know. Maybe she was onto something. - The nurse that sees dead people? Yeah, we should definitely substitute her judgment for ours. - Maybe it was somebody that she knew. Maybe it was somebody she knew that disguised himself and made a conscious decision to do it in a public place. Maybe he wanted to do it right in the center of the goddamn courtyard so there would be a witness, a witness that would testify that it wasn't him. - I'm gonna tell you the same thing that you told me, the first day on the job. It's never that complicated. - [Graham] Why are you here? - Well, I'd like to talk about Allison. - Ms. Parks' death was an awful, awful thing. And, um, when something like that happens, we feel out of control, angry, helpless. These are normal things. It's perfectly normal to feel these things. There's nothing you could do. There's nothing any of us could've done. - Who loved her? - Hm? - I think whoever did this loved her. Do you have any idea who it could be? - I'm not about to talk to you about my former patients. Besides, Allison hasn't seen me in months. - Why not? What happened? Was it depression? Was there a boyfriend? Was it... - I see our time is up. - All right, wait a minute-- - But I do think it would be good for you to come back and for us to keep talking. (dramatic orchestral music) - Mom? I'm home! Mom? Mom! (suspenseful orchestral music) Mom! Mom! Mom! - [Mom] Katie? - [Kaitlyn] Mom! - What? What is it, honey? - I was just here and I-- - What? - [Kaitlyn] You were gone. - [Mom] What? - I just, I just walked in here, and I didn't see you, and I thought, I thought maybe you had wandered off or something. - Wandered off? (laughing) I wish. Honey, you should relax. (sighing) (suspenseful orchestral music) - Did you hang that picture back up? - You did. - I did? - Don't you remember? - [Kaitlyn] You told me to call you if I had any new information. - [Peter] That's right. - Should I come down there? - No. No, here's no good. - Why? - [Peter] Can we do this someplace else? - Uh, you know the diner by the hospital? - I'm on my way. - Great. - [Canto] What do you got? - I've got a lead, pal. - Wouldn't happen to be a blonde, about 5'8", would it? - [Kaitlyn] It was unique. Kind of like this. Whoever killed her, took it. - So, how do you know this? - Did you see a broken necklace at the crime scene? - No, I didn't. - Well, she wasn't wearing it when she came into the ER, so find the necklace, find the killer. - Okay, well, it's not that simple. - Well, it's a clue, so do something. - Okay, I bust you snooping around the crime scene. Suddenly you have inside information. You have new evidence. Let's consider for the moment that I'm not a complete idiot. You want me to believe you? Why don't you start by not lying to me? - I'm not lying to you. - You're not telling me something. Try me. - I'm having memories. - What does that mean, "memories?" - I'm remembering the murder. I know things I can't possibly know. It's like I'm reliving it through her eyes, over and over again. I died that night too. Listen, in the ER, we hit Allison with the paddles, and the electricity went through her body and into mine, and my heart stopped. And once they revived me, I started seeing things that weren't there, and having memories that weren't mine. - If you interfere with this case again, I'm gonna be forced to arrest you for obstruction of justice. Do you understand that? - Look, I know how crazy I sound. - Do you? - I do. Yes! I do. But I'm not lying about this. - And she was wearing a necklace. - No, I saw her wearing that necklace. I saw the killer take it, and run with it, and now it's gone. - Okay, the perp also stole her wallet. It would make sense that he took any jeweler. It still fits the scenario of a mugging. - It wasn't a mugging. This was personal. I saw him go for the necklace like it was his, like he wanted it back while he was stabbing me. - Stabbing her, you mean. - Oh, yeah. Yes, of course. - Of course. - I think I can prove it. (upbeat dance music) - I knew it! I knew your were a cop! - Just have a couple of questions for you, all right? - So, what, you're gonna arrest me now? - Let's just keep the focus on me for right now, all right? - Look, I already told you cops everything. So what do you want? - We want to know about the necklace. - I don't know anything about a necklace. - [Peter] You've never seen this before? - Yeah, that necklace. Yeah, I know that necklace. What? - [Peter] You give it to her? - No. - You know who did? - Look, that was Alli's fave, man. She wore it every day. I don't know. I thought maybe she bought it. All I know is she never took it off, once she got it. - You mind if I go through your gear. - I don't have anything to hide. You're not gonna find anything. You're not gonna find, it's not like I have it. So, what? You're not a cop, or what? - No, I'm not. - Well, so why do you know about the necklace? What are you, a psychic or something? - Well, we need to find this necklace. - I thought you said it wasn't that simple. - Honestly, at the time, I didn't think the necklace existed. - So, what do we do now? - Well, tell me about these flashes, these visions, the clues. How do you have them? What sets them off? - I don't know, really. I thought I was going crazy. And sometimes I don't even know that they've happened until after they're over. - Well, we're about to trigger one right now. If anything's going to set one off, it's being here. This is exactly where we found the body. So you, uh, you seeing anything? Feeling anything? - I don't think it works like that. - Okay, just relax, Kate. Try and remember. You've been here before in your memory. So, right here, this is where you ended up, right? - Yeah, but I don't, I don't really want to see it again. - We need this, Kate. There's nobody else here. You're safe, okay? Nothing bad is going to happen. - Shit. - Just walk me through it from your perspective. She, what? She ran out? She tripped? She fell? - Yeah. - [Peter] Okay, and the guy is crouched over, he's attacking? - Yes. - [Peter] Stabbing. - Yeah. - Okay, that's good. That's good. Can you see his face? - No, it's too dark. - [Peter] Okay, just, just close your eyes and try and see it, Kate. - You want me to close my eyes? - [Peter] Can you tell me what he's wearing? - Um, he's in black, and he's got a knife. - Okay, good. That's good, can you describe it? - It's a big knife, it's a kitchen knife. - And the necklace? You have the necklace on? - Yeah. Yeah, it's around my neck, and, um, and he yanks it, and takes off, and then I wake up, and it's the same place, every time. It's the same place I wake up, every time. (sighing) - Okay. It's okay, it's okay. It's all right. - He's been watching us the whole time. - [Peter] Who? - Please tell me you saw that. - Okay, come on. Come on. - We're never going to find it here. - Well, I'm gonna look anyway. - He pulled it off her neck, Peter. - I got 14 eyewitnesses, Kaitlyn. The only one that saw something is the one that wasn't there. So, humor me, please. - I'm gonna check in the bedroom. (phone ringing) - Don't touch anything. - Hey, Val. I'm sorry, I just got wrapped up in something. Can you-- No, I'm fine. Yeah, my mom's fine too. There's just something I need to, I gotta go. (eerie ambient music) - Any luck? - No. - You might be right. I don't think it's here. - So how do we find it? - Well, I can add it to the evidence report. With any luck, it'll turn up at a pawn shop, and it's not particularly valuable. - [Kaitlyn] There's a pawn shop over by my apartment. - I've got this covered. It's not your responsibility, Kaitlyn. Do not let this take over your life. - I'm fine. - I know. I know. But I'm on this, with a new lead, thanks to you. (sighing) - So, what am I supposed to do now? - You're supposed to take care of yourself. That's it. Come on. Come on. - [Graham] If I could, I'd like to bring us back to your mother's illness. - Big surprise. - If you could, I'd like you to start talking about how it felt when you first started taking care of your mother. - You know, the police don't think Allison's murder was random anymore. They found some new evidence. I just thought you might find that interesting. - Do you find it interesting? - [Kaitlyn] Yes, I do. - [Graham] And your mother's illness-- - Isn't. But I did what I had to do, you know? She just got so sick so fast. There wasn't really time to think about anything else. You know, like in the ER. You don't think, you just react. She needed daily care, and I wanted it done right, so, I don't know, moving in with her seemed like the only solution. To be honest with you, I didn't think. I just reacted. I wanna be there for her, at the end. So, uh, yeah, I mean, yeah, it's, it's frustrating, but she needs me, so-- - Do you feel like she's a burden at all? - No. Never. - No resentment or anger in your difficult situation? You're only human. I mean, it doesn't mean you don't love her. - She gave me everything. She never asked me for anything. And you want me to sit here and whine about it? (sighing) - God, I can see why Allison stopped seeing you. - Just trying to help you. - When I moved in with my mother, she said she would never be a burden to me, and she never was. - That's good. I'm sure she just wants you to be happy. Sometimes, accepting your feelings-- - I found a gun, though. - Gun? - Yeah, I don't know what kind it was. It was a handgun. I was looking through her closets, going through some stuff, and I found it in a shoebox. Didn't really make any sense, because my mother hates guns. Eventually I found the receipt. She bought it the day she was diagnosed. - And what did you do? - I got rid of it. - Did you confront her about it? - No. (clearing throat) - Kaitlyn, I think your frustration with your mother and your inability to communicate your feelings is what's fueling your unhealthy obsession with Allison. - Fucking great. Where do I send the check? - You feel powerless to help your mother, so you're struggling to find a situation that you can take control of. - She didn't deserve to die! She was innocent, and nobody is fighting for her! They're just, they're brushing this thing off like it's something random, and I am the only one doing a goddamn thing about it! - Okay. Okay. - I'm so tired. I can't think. - Yeah, it's okay. Just take a deep breath. Nice deep breath. Breathe. (breathing heavily) You can say anything in here. You can think, feel, anything in here. You're safe. It's okay. All right? - We shouldn't do this. - Oh. - We shouldn't do this. - It's okay, Allison. It's only me. (ominous orchestral music) - What about your wife? - She can never find out. (woman vocalizing) - Help me. - Get off me! - You okay? - We were lovers. - Excuse me? Kaitlyn, are you okay? - Don't touch me! Don't you ever touch me! - Man, please tell me you didn't do what I think you did. - What? - Peter, I know who did it. - Come here, come here, come here, come here. I told you we shouldn't do this here. - I found a murderer. Where do you want me to go? A fire station? - Okay, so you saw something. - Yeah, Dr. Graham Barrett. Allison's therapist. He's the killer. I've been going there, pretending I'm a patient. - Dammit, Kate, do you hear yourself? - Hey, don't throw this in my face. I put myself in her surroundings like your told me to, and it triggered something. - This is not a game. I told you to lay off, that I would handle this. - Allison and Dr. Barrett were having an affair. I saw it. I saw it as clear as I'm seeing you. He kissed me, I mean her. He kissed her. - He kissed you? - Yeah, in the memory. I don't really know how else to explain it, but he didn't want his wife to find out, and I guess they started this thing on the side, and then it got too serious. - And then she threatened to go to the wife-- - Yeah, and then he kills her to keep her quiet. You have to arrest him, right now. - I can't arrest someone, Kate, without evidence. I just-- - He killed her! - Keep your voice down. Right now, all we have is your word and your vision, which is all we have right now. That's it. - I thought you said you believed me. - I do believe you, Kate. I do. But there's protocol. There's procedure. And unfortunately, your way won't hold up in court, and it'll most likely cost me my job. Please tell me you understand that. - I understand. - You gotta let me run with this, Kate. - I'm not sure what I told him. In session, I blacked out for a few seconds, maybe minutes, and I don't know what I said. I don't know what he knows. What if he knows that I know he's the killer. I mean, if he was willing to do that to Allison, what could happen to me? - Nothing. Nothing's gonna happen to you, Kate. I won't let anything happen to you, I promise. Okay? (dramatic orchestral music) (sighing) - Is he still out there? - Yeah, it's his job. - Makes me nervous. - Peter said he wanted to have somebody watching us all night. He wants us to be safe. - You better take him some coffee. - Think so? - Well, he's gonna be sitting outside in the cold all night. We want him wide awake. It's the least we could do. - All right. (chuckling) - I know all about your psychic nurse. Canto was right. You are too close to this. Hey, Rafferty, this, we're not wasting any more of the taxpayer's money. There's no reason to keep a car outside the nurse's place all damn night. (sighing) - Man, I did it for your own good. (ominous orchestral music) - Somebody order a coffee? (ominous orchestral music) - What are you doing here? - You-- - What are you doing here? - Are gonna give Allison a message from me. - [Kaitlyn] Please get in the car. Please, please don't get out of the car. Please. - [Man] I just want to talk. - Are you drunk? - I've been thinking a lot about Allison, and, do you, still talk, do you talk to her? - No, of course not. - Yeah, but you're like one of those psychics or something. - No, could you please get back in the car? - [Man] Yeah, but I just want to talk to her. - Let go of me. Let go of me! (grunting) - Aahh! - [Peter] You have the right to remain silent. I suggest you use it. - I just want to talk to Alli again! - You all right? - You gotta cut him loose, man. - I just need a little more time. - You can't charge him. You can't hold him. You know how it works. We didn't find shit in his apartment, his car either. - What about his alibi? - Checked out. He was DJ-ing the night that Parks was murdered. - Yeah? - 30 witnesses can place him at the scene. Might be a douchebag, but he's not our killer. - So, you are a pathetic little piece of shit. You're gonna stay away from her. You hear me? I catch you within half a mile of her and I swear to God I will break every bone in your body. You hear me? Cut him loose. (dramatic orchestral music) (vocalizing) (knocking on door) Hey. - [Kaitlyn] Hi. - You been okay? - Yeah, you know, you? - Been following the shrink. Care to see what I found? - My mom's asleep. This might not be the best time. - Any suggestion on what I should do with all of this? - So this is Barrett's place? - Yep. Lives with his wife on the top floor. The night that Allison Parks was killed, he had the whole place to himself. No alibi. - [Kaitlyn] Really? - Yeah, wife was out of town. Some convention. Turns out she goes out of town about once a month. - Well, then, that must've been when he had Allison over. - That would be my theory at the moment. - We need to search his place. We need to find the necklace, the knife, something. - We do, but that requires a search warrant. - [Kaitlyn] But you can get that. - The press is already watching me like a hawk. They think I'm working on another case as it is. - Oh. - But I can get one. If that's what we need, I'll get one. I don't know how, but I'll make it happen. - [Kaitlyn] Oh, and to think, when you first met me, you were ready to toss me in the loony bin and throw away the key. - I was a little skeptical. - Oh, a little bit? Okay. Well, thank you, for believing in me. - No, thank you. - For what? - It's been a long time since, since I believed in anything. (dramatic orchestral music) - Sorry, Sorry! I-- I haven't snuck a boy up here since high school. (laughing) My mom is in the other room. - Then we will have to be very quiet. (birds chirping) (dramatic orchestral music) (dramatic orchestral music) - I haven't slept that well in months. What's wrong? - She's not there. - What do you mean? - Your mother. There's no one living in that room. There hasn't been for a long time, as far as I can tell. - What are you talking about? Mom? Hey, Ma! - What's wrong, honey? - Nothing. Nothing. That's not fun, you're not funny! - Do you have someone over? - It's Peter. Mom, uh, this is Detective Peter Rafferty. Peter, this is my mom. Okay, now let's have some eggs. - Patricia Monahan, aged 62, died two months ago from complications from pancreatic cancer. - That doesn't make any sense. - Yeah, well, I'm looking right at her death certificate, man. Trust me, she ain't breathing. - Thanks for covering for me, the past few days. - You feeling okay? You seem-- - What? Happy? - I was gonna say distracted. - Oh, well, okay, Peter, you know, the cop? He came over last night, and he brought some food, and we had some wine-- - Sweetie, I am so sorry. - Why? I thought you'd be happy for me. - Hello, Kaitlyn. - Wait. Wait, wait, what is this? - It's good to see you again. It's been a long time. - No! Get away from me! - She's just here to help you get better. - No, I don't need help! I don't need this! Let go of me! You! What did you do? What did you tell them? What is going on? What's going on? What did you do? - I told them the truth. (dramatic orchestral music) - Get a hold of yourself, for God's sake. - I did everything. I did everything you told me to do. - Calm down, now. Calm down. We talked about this. You can't just show up here. - You said you would stay with me. We were going to be together forever! - Allison, you stop it. You shouldn't be here right now. - You said you loved me. - [Graham] Allison, I said stop it! - What is happening to me? - [Valerie] Hey! - What have they got me on? - [Valerie] It's okay, honey. Dr. Rosen's-- - No, it's not Dr. Rosen, it's Dr. Barrett. He's, he's trying to keep my quiet. - [Valerie] We're trying to help you now. Okay? It's okay. - Valerie, he's gonna try and kill me. - [Valerie] It's okay, honey. Just relax. - No, I-- - Just relax. - No, I-- - It's okay. It's okay. It's okay. There you go, sweetie. There you go, sweetie. - Go away. - I'm sorry, Kaitlyn. - You were the only one who believed me. - They're just gonna monitor you for a few days. Just to make sure everything is okay. - Did you tell Dr. Rosen you fucked me, or did you leave that part out? What about my mother? What if she needs her shots, and I'm not there to help her? - You don't need to worry about that right now. - What does that mean? - All that's important is that you get healthy. That's it, that you get back on your feet. - I am healthy. I'm healthy! I don't need this! I am so confused. This doesn't make any sense to me. Come on, we have to help Allison. We've gotta find that necklace, and you have to arrest Dr. Barrett. I'm not crazy, Peter. You know that. You know! Come on, I'm not crazy. (sighing) I had a memory. A real one. It was like the one with the necklace. - I want to show you something. I found this in your mother's house. - So? - I know you took this from Allison's apartment, the day I found you in the courtyard. I know that. - Yeah, I had a vision. The other picture fell, and that led me to-- - Look at what she's wearing. You saw this in the photo. Not in some vision or memory. You saw it in the photo, and then you subconsciously tied it to Allison's murder. - No, I'm, I never saw that necklace. Not that way. - I care about you, Kaitlyn. I'll do whatever it takes. I'm here for you. But you have to want to get help. - Hello, Kaitlyn. You came to see me a couple of times when your mother first got sick. Do you remember? How about we take these off? - Hm? - And talk a little bit. Are you starting to feel a little better? Okay. Detective Rafferty? She's suffering from severe disorientation. I think the day her mother died was so traumatic she's blocked it out. Now her mind is working to try and explain everything all away. Over time, and in the right environment, she'll find a way to sort out what's real. Here's my card. It has my direct number. As more questions arise. - Thank you. - Kaitlyn. (suspenseful orchestral music) (sighing) Kaitlyn? Kate! - Cop says to the hooker, "It's not polite to talk with your mouth full." (phone ringing) - Yeah, it's Rafferty. Then where the hell is she? (suspenseful orchestral music) (knocking on door) Kaitlyn! Kaitlyn, open up! It's me! Kaitlyn! (glass shattering) (phone beeping) - [Kaitlyn] Hi, Mom? It's not important. Are you okay? I know. Can you just hold on a little bit longer? There's something I have to do. (phone beeping) (knife thudding) (screaming) - How did you get in here? - I know what you did. I know you killed Allison Parks. I saw it. I found this. I saw it. I saw everything! - How about we talk this through like reasonable people? Think we can do that? Kaitlyn, I didn't kill anyone. I didn't kill Allison. - I found her necklace. - I don't know what you think that means. - Proof! - Proof of what? That I gave her a necklace as an innocent gift? It's a clarity symbol. I thought it would help her. She gave it back to me. - No! No, stop lying! I saw everything. (siren wailing) - What have you seen? - I saw the way you treated her. I saw the way you looked at her, the way you threw her away when you were done with her, and now, now you're trying to do the same thing with me, again. But that's not gonna work. I saw you! I saw you murder Allison Parks! - Let me help you. I know you think you're doing the right thing here. I realize that, but I want you to listen to the sound of my voice, Kaitlyn. You're suffering from something we call post-event information. It's a, after a trauma, your memories are vulnerable to facts and suggestions, ideas that you learn after the tragedy has occurred. - I saw you at the hospital with Dr. Rosen. You don't know me. (siren wailing) - I didn't kill anyone. The mind is a complicated organ. Our memories are like a jigsaw puzzle. But your mind is tricking you. It's creating puzzle pieces that don't even exist right now. - Shut up! - Let me help you. You need help. - I know what I saw. - I don't know what you want from me. - I want the truth. I want the truth about Allison. I want to know what's real. - Real. You want the truth. Truth is that we had an affair. And I don't know how you, this was our secret. I didn't kill her. My wife and I, we were having problems, and (sighing) one day, after a really emotional session, Allison and I, we kissed. I know that was wrong. I know it now. I never meant for it to become serious, but it did. Hell, we ended up seeing each other after every session. - Why didn't you come forward? Why didn't you come forward when she was murdered and tell people what you knew? - Why would I want to put my wife through all that, after? What would be the point? If the affair ever got out, my career would be ruined. I would be finished. Allison appreciated that. She said she understood that. When I went to break it off, she asked me to leave my wife, and I told her I couldn't. She threw the necklace back in my face, and she walked out the door, and I never saw her again. That's the truth. You gotta believe me. I would never kill Alli, I would never hurt her. Not in a million years. I loved her. I love her still. (gun firing) (suspenseful orchestral music) (grunting) (grunting) (grunting) - Kaitlyn, wait, wait! No, no, no, no. - I got him. - Okay, okay, okay. I need you to put the gun down. - Help me. - I'm gonna put my gun down. - [Kaitlyn] He did it! - I need you to put it down now. - He killed her. You believe me, right? That he killed her? - I'm innocent! - Shut up! - Kaitlyn! Kaitlyn! Listen to me, you're confused right now. - Stop saying that to me. - Kate, this is not about Allison, okay? This is about your mother. Listen to me, you did everything you could, Kate. You did. But sometimes, it's just not enough. You know that. - She loved me. - This, Kate, this is not, gonna bring her back, okay? Kate, I know what happened. I read the medical files, Kate. I know what happened, the day that she died. (glass shattering) - Did that stupid picture fall again? I'll be right there. - Your mother was sick, Kate. She had cancer. There's not rhyme or reason for it. - Mom? Mom! Mom, hang on. Hang on! Hang on, Mom! Mom, stay with me, please! You're okay. You're okay. Mom, just a minute, just a minute. Please, please, please hang on! Hang on! Mom! Hang on, please! Mom! Please don't! Mom! Mom! No! Please don't! Mom! Please! No! No! Mom! Mom! (crying) (dramatic orchestral music) Mom. I just, I just, I let her die. She loved me. - She loved you. - It's almost exactly what you thought you heard Allison say. - You see what's happening here? This man did not kill Allison. I know you'd like there to be more to this, Kate, but there's just not. Your mother's gone, Kate. (screaming) But there's absolutely nothing, nothing that you can do about this. (screaming) - Help me. - I thought I told you nobody could find out. (grunting) (gun firing) - Goddammit, Kate! (groaning) Detective Rafferty. I need an ambulance to my location. Shots fired. I have a man down. Please respond. Priority three. - [Minister] Life is precious, but life is also beyond our control. While difficult to accept, we often have little power over such things. When our time comes, and our time must come, it does so without warning or explanation. (dramatic orchestral music) Thus we should embrace every second we are allowed to remain on this vibrant planet. (dramatic orchestral music) (dramatic orchestral music) (dramatic orchestral music)
