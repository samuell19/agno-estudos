Ave Maria, gratia plena, Dominus tecum. Benedicta tu in mulieribus, et benedictus fructus ventris tui, lesu. Sancta Maria, Mater Dei, ora pro nobis peccatoribus, nunc et in hora mortis nostrae. Amen. Well, what do you say? I don't like it. What is wrong with it? There's nothing wrong with it. I just don't like it. Look here, my old friend. Would... You are my friend, aren't you? Yes. Well, would I suggest anything that might go wrong? You would. Look at the last time. You were supposed to watch in the street. How was I to know they kept dogs? I've still got the scars. I'll show you. This ain't like that. We don't have to break in anywhere. It's all in the open. Nothing can go wrong. That's what you said the time before. I got six months. I've had enough of it. All right, then. All right. We won't say no more about it. Forget I ever mentioned it. If you don't trust me, that's all right with me. I'll just have to do it on me own, that's all. All right, then. I'm going home. Of course, the doctor did say that I mustn't do anything that might strain my heart. I'll see you tomorrow. And, er... I shall have the whole ten marks to meself. - Ten? - Ten. - You said six! - Ten, I meant. Still, that don't worry you no more, does it, 'cause you ain't coming with me. Ten. Ten marks... for a dead'un. Yeah, well, like I say. You gotta know where to find these things. You gotta keep your eyes open. Take this one, for a start. He only got planted this morning, you know. He'll be as fresh as a daisy. Who is he? Who? Him! Or is it her? An 'er? No, it can't be an 'er. It only came from the prison this morning. Look, don't stand there talking. Come on, we ain't got all night, you know. 'ere. Come and have a look! A baron! Well... shall we get any more for him? I ain't never seen a real-life baron before. Come on, hurry up! Blimey. 'ere. It's a priest with no head! What if he is a priest? He's a dead'un, isn't he? Still worth ten marks to me, isn't he? Course, er... the head's a bit of a problem. Good evening. I am Baron Frankenstein. Hear, hear. - Hear, hear. - Quite right. I ask you, gentlemen, what do we really know about him? - What do any of us know? - Nothing at all. He came here three years ago and set himself up in practice. Before then, no-one had even heard of him. Where did he study? Where did he take his degree? What's his background? Do any of you know? - No! - No. No more do I. Yet here he is, well-established. The most popular doctor in Carlsbrück, by all accounts. He hasn't applied for a place on the Medical Council. I've even heard he says he can do without the Council. Looks as though he's right there, doesn't it? He's managed to steal half my best patients. - And mine. - And mine. Exactly! And mine too. Your wife amongst them, I understand, sir? Yes, well, I put a stop to that! Gentlemen, gentlemen. Well, the fact remains, gentlemen, Dr Stein must be made to join this Council, or steps must be taken to see that he is no longer permitted - to practise in this city. - Hear, hear! Quite right! Assuming he refuses to join, how do you intend to stop him practising medicine? Mr President? Erm... well, we have never attempted to prevent any doctor from practising in the city. However, Dr Stein's refusal to join, er... to become one of us, is an affront. - Quite so. - Are there any suggestions? - Oh, well, er... - Send a delegation to see him. Excellent. Delegation. Yes. - Made up of, er...? - Three. Of course, three. Yes, three. Three doctors from the Council here. - That is what I suggest. - Seconded. - All in favour? - Yes. - Fine. Fine. - We ought to make an appointment. - Hmm? - He's right. No-one gets into Dr Stein's surgery without an appointment. Oh, he's most charming. So clever. My dear Dr Stein, Vera is in great distress! Indeed, Countess Barscynska. Please, would you...? Well, I know that you insist that she's cured, - but I see no improvement whatsoever. - I understand. She's weak and faint, the movement of every muscle is an effort. Raise your head, Vera. Higher, my child! You see? No animation, no vitality. You must revise your diagnosis. Overhaul her! Vera, my dear, go and prepare yourself. Yes, yes. Now, let me see. What was your daughter's original complaint? Really, Dr Stein! It started with palpitations, then dizziness... - Well, how could you forget? - She's not my only patient, Countess. Oh, those women outside. I know most of them. They're all in perfect condition. Nothing wrong with them at all. You should be my partner. We could dispose of surgery in half the time. That, of course, would mean half the money. Oh, I know their fees subsidise your work at the poor hospital. I know how good you are to the poor, Doctor. But my daughter, Vera, she's all I have in the world. Mm-hmm. Of course. I'm afraid there's very little more I can do for your daughter. Doctors are not magicians. We cannot diagnose maladies which are not there. You are a man, Doctor! You can do a great deal for her. Everything I have goes to Vera when she marries. It was her father's last wish. Now I'm having a musical evening soon. I so much hope you'll be able to come. Much as I like music, I have very little free time. Ah, poor man! A life devoted to the needs of others. No time for a life of your own. There's always time for the important things. - Doctor, I'm ready! - So am I, Vera. You may come out. Excuse me. You see? Just a few steps and the poor child is exhausted. Every movement is an effort. - I'll go wait outside. - No, please. It is better that you stay. You always used your ear before. I still use my ear. This just magnifies the sound. - Oh, Mama, it's so cold! - Stand still, dear. Now, breathe deeply. I can't breathe. That thing's so cold. Can you hear the palpitations with that? Wouldn't it be better to use your ear? There's, erm... three men to see you, Dr Stein. They're from the Medical Council. - They must wait until after surgery. - Yeah, well, they seemed impatient. When I've finished! You're the doctor. Have them wait in the ward. - What? In the ward? - In the ward! And shut the door! Oi, you! Tell Dr Stein I want me rum ration! Right, I'll tell him. - Murdering butcher, that's what he is! - Tsk-tsk-tsk-tsk-tsk. He'd better not try and do nothing with me. I'll strangle him with me bare hands, I will! You're gonna frighten him. How can I do me dance without me legs? You'll have to learn to sing! Ah, this way, gentlemen. This way. This is intolerable! Gentlemen, you must remember that these are the poor. The stench is enough to kill me. Er... Dr Stein says for you to make yourselves comfortable in 'ere. - Comfortable! You tell Dr Stein... - Ooh! Doctor... There's Dr Stein, gentlemen. Looking after the poor and needy. Look at this. Interesting, isn't it? Quite a work of art. - What do you think, gentlemen? - Er, why, it's, er... - Very picturesque. - We didn't come here to... - You must have it off. - Have what off? This arm. You'll have to strangle him with one arm, Harry! He ain't gonna have my arm off, that's for sure. If you'd rather die, it's up to you. - Let him have it, Harry. - The arm don't pain me none. It's of no use to you. - What do you mean, no use? - Be quiet. Five o'clock in the theatre. Doctor, I won't be able to work no more. - What is his work? - Pickpocket. Then you'll have to find another trade, or use the other hand. Excuse me, gentlemen. - Is he new? - Admitted this morning. - Oi, me pipe! - What's your trouble? It... it's me chest, guv'nor. I'm not surprised. You use it like a furnace. It's amazing how dirty these people are, isn't it? Keeps them warm, they tell me. Well, hmm? What can I do for you? Well, er... I am the President of the Medical Council. Congratulations. At our last meeting, it was agreed that you should become a member. Really? Have this new man washed, then I'll look at him. - I'm greatly honoured, gentlemen. - Then you accept? - No. - Huh? Every doctor in the faculty regards your attitude as an insult. When I arrived in Carlsbrück, without means or influence, and attempted to set up in practice, I was met by a firm resistance from the Medical Council, which apparently exists purely to eliminate competition. I have built up a highly successful practice, alone and unaided. Having grown accustomed to working alone, I find I prefer it. - Do I make myself clear, gentlemen? - Quite clear. Thank you. Good day. - You haven't heard the last of this! - A lot he cares! What more can I do? Well, he won't pick any more pockets with that arm. And you'll have the parcel ready for my messenger when he calls? Right, Doctor. - Your supper's all ready in there. - Good night to you, then. - Good night, Doctor. - And thank you. A masterly dissection, Dr Stein. You must forgive this intrusion. Must I? I wanted to renew our acquaintance. After a few moments with you this afternoon, I was sure I'd seen you before. That's hardly surprising. I've been practising here in Carlsbrück for the last three years. Before that. A little more than three years ago, at the village of Inkstadt, I was attending the funeral of Professor Bernstein. You've heard of him, no doubt? Everyone has heard of Professor Bernstein. I was a last-year student at the university where he was lecturing when he... died. - May I offer you some chicken, Dr...? - Kleve. Hans Kleve. No, thank you. Perhaps a little cheese? I can recommend it. The professor was buried in the family vault of Baron Frankenstein. Shall I go on? Please. Please do. I'm the first, I suppose, to recognise you. For what I am, or what you would have me be? No, the resemblance is too striking. That, and... Your present activities lead to only one conclusion. So, and what if I am this Baron Frankenstein? Are you? Just now, you were telling me. Now you're asking. Dr Kleve, why are you so interested in this gentleman? I'm in search of knowledge. Oh, knowledge? Ah, so that's it. My name is Frankenstein, I'll admit. But it's a large family, you know. Remarkable since the Middle Ages for productivity. There are offshoots everywhere. Even in America, I'm told. There's a town called Frankenstein, in Germany. Are you the Baron Frankenstein? There are the Frankensteins emanating from the town of that name in Silesia. Are you Baron Frankenstein? Yes, Dr Kleve. I was sure of it! I told you that I'm in search of knowledge. I want to learn more than any university could ever teach me. I want to be the pupil of the greatest doctor, the finest medical brain in the world. Your pupil, Baron Frankenstein. Highly commendable. And if I refuse? You won't. So, either I employ you in my researches, or... Surely this is blackmail? An ugly trait in a doctor. I see it as an agreement of, shall we say... mutual reciprocation? Your knowledge in return for my assistance. And your silence? - I'm not an easy man to work for. - Few men are. And when you've learned all you want to know, you might change your mind about keeping silent. I wonder if I can trust you. But then uncertainty is part of life's fascination, isn't it? I'll take the risk if you will. Will you accept me as your pupil? Where did you study? Under Professor Anderson in Edinburgh, Dr Karl Strauss in Vienna, at the hospital in Paris... Enough. Unlike yours, my practice is negligible. When do we start working together? Now. Incidentally, Hans, you must exercise great caution when addressing me. My name is Stein. Victor Stein. Yes, of course. The Austrian or Swiss branch of that family, Dr Stein? Let's settle for Switzerland. It's an exhilarating climate, if a little heady. Please, do join me. After supper, I'll show you round my laboratory. - Evening, Doctor. - Good evening. The other one's down below, waiting for you. Not the best setting for a laboratory, but it's ideal for my purpose. Careful! It would be a pity to lose you... so soon. Surprised? Originally, this was a wine cellar. Karl, this is Dr Hans Kleve. He is to work with us. - Do we really need him? - Oh, yes. I shall need an assistant. Dr Kleve presented himself just at the right moment. The doctor trusts me, Karl. I hope you will, too. Good. Oh, this is Otto, our chimpanzee. Karl, you collected the parcel? Yes. Yes, Doctor. It's over here. Hans... That's the arm of the pickpocket! It is, indeed. You need sensitive fingers to be a member of that profession. It'll be very useful to me. Now, come here. Well, what is it? - A brain. - A brain? If you put your hand too near a fire, what makes you snatch it away? - The nerves. - Exactly. The nerves of the hand send a message to the brain, and the brain activates the muscles for withdrawing the hand. But you don't put your hand too near the fire if you see it first. The eye recognises fire as a harmful agent. Let me demonstrate. Now observe. The brain, the hand, the eyes. Watch the eyes. Fascinating, isn't it? So this is a brain. All this paraphernalia, and capable of only one simple reaction. Imagine for one moment the complexity of the human brain, the same size, perhaps, but a million times more efficient. It controls every action, every reaction, stores memories, it motivates all life, and this is all I've been able to do. But you should be proud. I've never seen anything like it! Haven't you? No, I don't suppose you have. You know that I... that Frankenstein, was condemned to death? - Yes. - Do you know what for? But surely everyone knows? The story's become a legend. He created a man who became a monster. It should have been perfect. I made it to be perfect. If the brain hadn't been damaged, my work would have been hailed as the greatest scientific achievement of all time. Frankenstein would have been accepted as a genius of science. Instead, he was sent to the guillotine. I swore I would have my revenge. They will never be rid of me. This is something I am proud of. Who is he? Nobody. He isn't born yet. But this time he is perfect. Except for a few scars, he is perfect. And you made this body from other bodies? Yes. My voluntary work at the poor hospital serves me very well. All I need is the brain, and then I can give it life. You've seen the result of this, and it's by no means my first attempt. I only keep this cumbersome thing to remind me of the impossibility of the task, should I ever think of trying again. No, the brain must be a living one. Unlike the limbs, life cannot be restored once life has gone. The brain is life, and so a living brain must be used. But surely that would mean committing murder? No, not necessarily. I have a volunteer. He's here, in the laboratory. No, Hans, not you. No, your brain is too valuable where it is. His over there. - You mean Karl? - Yes. We made a bargain. If he saved me from the guillotine, I would give him a new body. Yes, but his paralysis. Surely that indicates an injury to the brain? I examined him thoroughly. The paralysis is due to a blood clot. It can be dispersed during the operation. Karl has a fine brain. He's quick, intelligent, and he's absorbed a great deal of knowledge since working with me. Haven't you, Karl? Dr Stein is welcome to my brain. As long as he rids me of... this. You must have great faith in Dr Stein? I have. Are you sure it can be done? The operation will be a complete success. There's a... a young woman asking for you, Doctor. She's a real lady. She's got scent on. Must have come to the wrong surgery. Finish dressing that, will you? - Right, Doctor. - Where is she? She's in the Doctor's room. Good morning. Good morning. Er... Dr Stein's not here, I understand? No, no. He's at his surgery in town. - Um... would you like to sit down? - Yes, thank you. - You don't mind if I get cleaned up? - No, please do. I'm Margaret Conrad. I shall be working here. Oh? The Doctor didn't tell me about that. My father is the Minister. Dr Stein has been informed. I see. I shall read to the sick. Shop for them, you know. Get them things like tobacco, writing paper, soap. My dear lady! They seldom wash, and they never write. But I'm sure you'll be able to find plenty to do. Thank you. I won't disappoint you. Or Dr Stein. Oh, I... Oh, Karl, this lady's going to work here. Did you want something, Karl? Er... I... I was to... No, it can wait. Oh, well, if it's a professional matter, I'll leave you. Er... No, please. I'll come back. Oh! When I offered him my hand, I didn't realise. He seemed quite taken with you. Is he a patient? No, he helps Dr Stein. Oh, there's a very sound brain in that unfortunate body. Are you quite sure you want to work here? I'm quite sure. I did my best to dissuade her, but it would be inconvenient if I were forced to leave the hospital because of her father. Well, she seems a very determined young lady. You get her to wash one of the patients. That should frighten her away. You ready? Where are we going? The laboratory. Tonight, we give Karl his new body. You wanted to learn. Come on! Karl, are you ready? I'm ready, Doctor. Good... Thank you. You keep looking at him. Very soon, that will be you. Ready. This is to preserve the body. - Embalming fluid? - Yes. Hans. Keep it steady at 80. Dr Stein! Anaesthetic! Quick, man! Switch off! All right. How long before he regains consciousness? An hour or so. His brain'll take some time to adjust itself to his new body. He must have complete rest, and avoid any sudden or violent movement. As a precaution, I shall keep him strapped for a few days. It was a superb operation, Doctor. I learned a great deal from it. Thank you for your assistance. This is only the beginning of our work together. - Must be Otto's feeding time. - Yes. So it is. That was one of Karl's duties. I'd better do it for him. I wonder what he makes of all this. He'd be very interested, if he knew. In my early experiments with a live brain, I used reptiles. I removed the brain from a lizard and replaced it with a frog's. The lizard attempted to jump, but of course it was physically incapable. But it proved my theory. The brain will continue its normal function, regardless of its environment. Later, I used anthropoids. I gave Otto the brain of an orangutan. - Was it successful? - You can see for yourself. Now... I want Karl close at hand, where we can watch him. We must get him to the hospital. I've prepared an attic room there. Won't that be dangerous, so soon after the operation? Not if we take care. Get on! Please, be calm. Try to relax. You're quite safe now. He's bound to have a certain amount of pain as the anaesthetic wears off. Now, Karl... Karl, can you hear me? You've made wonderful progress in the past week. These are necessary for a little while. I'm sorry. It won't be for long. - Hans? - Yes. Good. Now... Just reflect the light on his right eye, will you? Keep it steady. Mm-hmm. Now, the left. Yes, excellent. Now, Karl, try and move your left arm. Left. Now, the right. There's very little wrong with you, Karl. Congratulations. I'm due in the ward now. Dr Kleve will stay with you. - You'll see to the straps? - Yes, of course. Except for the movement of his right arm, his reactions are excellent. Even better than I expected. Now, talk to him. Don't overtax him, but keep his mind fairly active. When he shows signs of fatigue, give him one of those. You can leave him to rest then. I shall go to the laboratory as soon as I've finished in the ward. Send for me at once if you need me. - You have your key? - Yes. Karl? You'll be up and wearing those clothes in no time! Dr Kleve? Yes, Karl? When can I see my new body? Very soon now. I think you'll be proud. Dr Kleve, what is... to happen to me, after? Oh, there are great plans for you. Doctors and scientists will come from all over the world to see you, and to talk to you. You're a very important person now, Karl. Dr Stein intends to hold student lectures. They'll see you, a normal man with a normal body, side by side with your old body. All my life I've been stared at. It will be different now, Karl. You'll be able to play a great part in the advancement of medical science. Oh. - Are you in pain? - No. I think you'd better rest now. Not too much excitement just yet. Here. Drink this. Hello, Ned. Still suffering, eh? - How are you today? - Better, miss, thank you. Oh, good. I am glad. Well, now. Would you care for something today? There's some soap, writing paper, or tobacco. Oh, well, I'll have it all in tobacco, if I may, miss. - No soap? - I never use it. - Miss Conrad? - Yes, Doctor? I must ask you to keep out of the ward when I'm on duty. - Have you anything to do? - Yes, sir. - Do it, then. - Yes, sir. - He's a moody cove, ain't he? - Mmm. I beg your pardon? Oh, I'm sorry, miss, but, er... if you knew what I knew... Cor. Cruel, he is. He cuts 'em up, you know. Alive. Don't talk such nonsense. What? Here, let me tell you, miss, he had a new one in the other night. Horrible state he was in. All strapped down, he was. Screaming his head off. I don't believe a word you're saying. You can see for yourself. They keep him in a special room, an attic. - All locked up, of course. - Oh! Well, then, perhaps I'd better see him. Just in case you're telling the truth. - Would you like to show me the way? - Well, of course I will. I know where they keep the master key. They don't know I know, but I know a lot of things that might surprise 'em, eh? You wait 'ere. I'll go and fetch it. Oh, er... I might as well take my tobacco now, eh? In case I forget it. Ta. Don't forget to lock 'im up when you're finished. And let me have the key back, eh? Oh, I'm sorry. Did I waken you? Miss Conrad, it's you. How did you know my name? I've met you once before. You wouldn't remember. Did Dr Stein send you to see me? No. No, I just came to see if... if you were comfortable. Thank you. - All right, come in. - Thank you, Doctor. Oh, really, I... I didn't intend to, er... Oh. Well, if you insist. Here you are. Thank you, Doctor. Ooh, that's better. Just the stuff for a cold day, eh? If you used that broom a bit more, you wouldn't feel the cold. Oh. How's the, um... how's the special patient, Doctor, eh? - What do you know about him? - Oh, nothing. Nothing at all, except he's special. What's so different about him? Ain't he got fleas? If you washed yourself, you wouldn't have fleas. What, me, wash? Cor! I'd catch pneumonia, like as not. No, I'll have me fleas and keep me health and strength. What is your work? I... I have no work. Oh, you will soon get some. You'll forget all about your illness. I will help you when you're better. You must come and see me. I will write down my address for you, shall I? I'll put it in your pocket. These straps, they hurt. Oh, they're far too tight. I'll loosen them for you. Now, then. Take the animals in the jungle. They don't wash none, and yet they keep 'ealthy. You never hear of them getting sick. 'Cause why? Because they are good and dirty. And what do you know about the animals in the jungle? Ah, you'd be surprised. I'm a great animal fancier. I know all about their habits. Because you practise them yourself, eh? And what's wrong with that? They was here before we was, and they'll be here a long time after we've gone. They know how to look after themselves. Well, take the monkeys, for instance. They got a good layer of dirt to keep 'em warm. Plenty to eat, plenty to drink. I bet they laugh at us sometimes, on the quiet, eh? Now, if you get hungry, you have to cook yourself a meal of meat and potatoes. Not them, no. They get hungry, they reaches out for a banana. They don't have to worry about cooking or nothing. They don't even eat meat. - They don't, do they? - Meat? 'Course they don't. Erm... do you mind if I help myself to another one, Doctor? No? Thanks. Did Otto eat flesh before you operated? No, I discovered it soon after the operation. He ate his wife. Ate another monkey? What else would he be married to? Do you mean he turned into a cannibal? Yes. I didn't attempt to correct it. He'd been through enough already, and he's perfectly happy and in good health. But surely... I mean, couldn't the same thing happen to Karl? There's no danger of that, so long as his brain is given time to heal. Otto became agitated after his operation. He fractured one of the cells of the brain. Does Karl know about what happened to Otto? Of course he does. It's just as well. He knows what could happen to him, so he'll take no unnecessary risks. Hans, I finished something today. I'd like to show it to you. What do you think of it? I thought you'd be interested. Before we go back to the hospital, I want you to help me get him into the tank. Who's down there? Where are yer? Hey! You heathen beast! There y'are! Afraid I'm gonna bust your skull in, are yer? That'll teach you. Don't hit me, please. I won't hit you. Now I'll have to hit you some more, to make up for all the damage you just done. Get up! But how...? But he was asleep when I left him. I gave him a sedative. How could he have undone the straps? Why, Hans, not how. Why. There's always a reason why. What happened before you gave him the sedative? Well, I don't remember. Pull yourself together, man! Tell me! Well, I... I talked to him. I told him your plans for his future. You told him that? You fool! You stupid fool! Do you know nothing of human reactions? Let me think. Where would he go? The laboratory. Look! He burnt his old body. The janitor must have disturbed him. Suppose his brain was damaged in the fight? Sooner or later he'll need my help. He knows that. Go back to the hospital and carry on normal routine. I shall stay here. - But shouldn't we search for him? - Do as I tell you! Ah! Thank you, Joseph. I'm just going in to see the ponies. Hello, my lovelies. How about a piece of sugar, hmm? Piece of sugar for Mama? Good! How about you, eh? Come on, I've got a piece for you. Come over here. There. - What are you doing here? - I... I... I had to get away. You said you'd help me. Does Dr Stein know you've left the hospital? No! No, don't tell him, please! Please don't tell him! - You'd better come with me. - No, no, no, let me stay here. You need looking after. I must tell Dr Stein. No! Well, Karl... Karl, you cannot remain here. Not like this. You've... you've been kind to me. Please, please, not Dr Stein! If I promise not to tell him, will you stay here until I get back? I won't be long. Try to rest this as much as you can, will you? Yes, Doctor. Hans, I must speak to you. It's urgent. Come and see me again in a few days' time. Yes, Doctor. Look, I found Karl this morning. He's at my aunt's home, in the stable. At your... - I must get Dr Stein! - Oh, no, no. Please, Karl's terrified of him. I'm sorry. I must get him. Please. The poor man's nearly out of his mind. Anyway, I promised him I wouldn't bring Dr Stein. - Then I'd better come. - I have a carriage. Please! He was in pain. I thought I was helping him. Of course you did. Karl, I brought Dr Kleve. But he was there! I left one of the groomers with him. Joseph. Where's that man I told you to look after? I don't know, miss. I went to water the horses, and when I came back, he'd gone. - Dr Stein must be told now. - Shall I come with you? No, no. You stay in the house. Oh, stop that, can't you? Well, what are you getting annoyed about? What do you think I'm getting annoyed about? We've been 'ere half an hour, and all you can find to do is look at a lot of ants. Well, ants is interesting. You can learn a lot from ants. Well, you haven't learned much. What do you mean? They've got more sense than to sit around all night. They get on with it. On with what? Oh, I'm going home! Good night, Gerda. Gerda! Gerda! Is it much further? We're in the park now. The Countess' house is about three miles away on the other side. Can't we go any faster? I feel I'm to blame for this. But I thought it'd be wiser to go myself. When Miss Conrad told me she'd promised... You should have come to me at once! These interfering women! Why have you stopped? Oh, it's you, Dr Stein. I'm sorry to trouble you, sir, but we have to check on everyone passing this way. There's been a murder in the vicinity. Can I be of assistance? Oh, this is Dr Kleve. - Good evening, sir. - Good evening. Well, sir, if you could examine the body, we should like to have a report. - Certainly. - Come this way, sir. - When did this happen? - About an hour ago, this boy says. Did you see who attacked her? All he could tell me was, when he heard the girl scream, he shouted, and then the man rushed off. If it was a man. What do you mean? Well, sir, the boy said he had a strange shape. Almost like an animal. But, of course, he only caught a glimpse of him. I think this is more than just an ordinary murder. Have you searched the park? Thoroughly, sir. Well, there's nothing I can do here. I'll let you have my report. Thank you, sir. Sorry to have detained you. I have nothing against the English composers, Dr Molke. It's just that they won't let themselves go. - Not even Handel? - Ah, but he was stolen from Germany. - Dr Victor Stein, Dr Hans Kleve. - Oh, Dr Stein, so you came after all. Countess, I wish to speak to your niece. It is very urgent. Ah, but the night is young. Vera, my dear! - Excuse me. - Certainly. When you found Karl in the stable, was he the same as when you saw him in the hospital? Yes, but he was very distressed. - Is that the last you saw of him? - Yes. - Are you certain he hasn't returned here? - Yes. I... Oh! Frankenstein! Frankenstein. Help me. "Frankenstein, help me!" Those were his very words. - And then what happened? - The poor fellow collapsed, dead. Stein and young Kleve carried him from the room, and that's all I know. I summoned this meeting right away. You did correctly, Dr Molke. What we have to decide now, gentlemen: is this man Frankenstein or not? Mr President, while I was waiting for the senior members of this Council to gather, I spent my time going through the old records relating to this Frankenstein. The description of him given in them fits our friend, Dr Stein, very closely. Dr Stein, I beg you to listen to me! Get away from here, across the border! We can start again somewhere else. There's no hurry. But everyone heard Karl call you Frankenstein! Molke was there. He'll report to the Medical Council. They're bound to take action. You know the way they feel about you. This is the chance they've been waiting for. There was always the risk that I might be identified. - My plans were made accordingly. - But you can't stay here! I shall be at the surgery in the morning at my usual time. Have you seen your waiting room? It's deserted. - The whole town knows who you are. - Do they? And I've been summoned before the Medical Council. What am I to say? I'll come with you. That would be madness. Let me do what I can. I've nothing to fear from them. What can they prove? On our way, Hans, I have something to tell you. Gentlemen, I deny it absolutely! You deny your name is Frankenstein? Have you ever consulted a street directory, sir? Any street directory for any town in central Europe? You will find dozens of Frankensteins. I am a Frankenstein. Of course I'd heard of Baron Frankenstein, who created that monster some three years ago, but naturally I didn't wish to set up in practice here handicapped by such a name, so I changed it. But the resemblance? The uncanny resemblance? This is a monstrous accusation, inspired by jealousy. Baron Frankenstein? Dr Stein! Dr Stein. How do you explain that wretched fellow calling you Frankenstein? For the very same reasons as your own, I should imagine. I think a little proof, Mr President, rather than a lot of gossip, would be advantageous to us all. - One moment. - Excuse me. I am a busy man. Good day, gentlemen. Dr Kleve, we have not yet questioned you. All right, open the coffin. - It's a priest's hat! - Rosary. We were right. Frankenstein is not dead. He asked for proof. Now we have it. You were just like the raw material for him! - How's the head today, Kleiner? - Don't lay your filthy hands on me. Don't be a fool, man. I've got to look at it. You heard me. Keep your murdering hands off me, Frankenstein. Yes, that's what I said. Frankenstein! Fugitive from the gallows. Murderer. Mutilator. Doctor, Doctor! They're killing him in there. Killing him. Killing who? Frankenstein. On the bed. - Hans... - Don't talk. It's no good. You know what to do. Yes, I know. What kind of a place is this? I have a warrant for the arrest of Victor Stein! Come in, Inspector. - Where is he? - This way. What happened? It was his patients at the hospital. They went mad and practically tore him to pieces. I brought him here and operated in the hope of saving his life. Well, the body must be taken and buried in unhallowed ground. As it should have been three years ago! Pray heaven I've got the skill to do this. You were an excellent pupil, Hans. This scar will hardly show. Your next patient is waiting, Dr Franck. Thank you. Lady Benborough and Wendy. How nice to see you. SUBTITLES BY POWERHOUSE FILMS LTD
