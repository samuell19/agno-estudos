KUCK 1300, the resistance. We were just getting in a serious matter over here. Nobody wants to talk about how at any given time there's thousands, thousands of people missing. Nobody cares. Tracy Anderson, the missing Lobo Falls girl was found earlier this morning on the edge of Inasanis ravine, Northwest of Ludlow Falls. East of the falls, caller you're on. Women, please stay away from these places. Stay away from Edinburgh Manor. The old orange junior high. Women, young women stay away. If you look into the eye of this thing, he's gonna render you just crazy. I mean, you're gonna find yourself wandering around half-naked out in the country on a gravel road, speaking jibberish. As it is written, none is righteous, no, not one. No one understands, no one seeks for God. All have turned aside, together they have become worthless. No one does good, not even one. The venom of ask is under their lips. Their mouth is full of curses and bitterness. As I have observed, those who plow evil and those who sow trouble shall reap it. We are but sheep, and evil has arrived. Tiffany Perdidas was found today, wandering along the D17, a gravel road, just outside Ludlow Falls. Authorities are puzzled by the similarities between this and the recent cases of missing women that have been found. Her brother's ex, she was a bride's maid on her wedding, went missing for about three days. Dude, she was in our old junior high school. She was wandering around the hallways, drawing weird stuff all over the chalkboards, really messed up stuff. You know the PolterGuys, like the ghost hunter guys? They were there. Like they have their own TV show and stuff. They were shooting an episode down there. Thank God they found it. Oh look. If you are a young man, African-American by the name of Kenny Jones is responsible for two counts of murder and several kidnappings around Ludlow Falls area. I tell you, it stinks rotten. After two hours of deliberation today, Tina Adams was convicted on all counts for the murder of Holly Work. 20-year-old Adams will be treated at the St. Jupiter Hospital for the Criminally Insane. Ludlow Falls police Department have a suspect in custody for the recent murder of police veteran, Captain Kirk. John Baker, a local farm hand who lives on the north side of Ludlow Falls. Cindy Schlozman is in custody now at the Ludlow Falls police station and has been formally charged in the murder of Kayla Grant. We have Cindy Schlozman in our custody. We will be transporting her to St. Dymphna Hospital for evaluation with a Dr. Bashiri. The body of Ludlow Falls middle school teacher, Chester Franklin was found in downtown in Ludlow Falls early this morning. The authorities have not released any details in regards to the apparent homicide. The bodies of two young men were found on the north edge of Ludlow Falls earlier this morning, and a young woman has also been reported missing. Hello, polter fans. We are of course the PolterGuys. And now you know that? Because you're our biggest fans. And because you're on our Instagram. Well, guess what? We don't have much time because we are in the middle of a very spooky investigation in the dinkle donk basement. Yeah, it's a very special basement. But we wanted to tell you about something very special that's happening for our next episode. That's right. We're going to be asking you, the PolterGuys' fans to vote on our next haunting locale. We're going to be going to Chicago, or Paris or Cabo. Oh, if you find it in your little scary bones, you can write in a suggestion if you'd like. But we are contractually obligated to go wherever you send us. So please vote as soon as you can. And we'll see you next week with the results. They said we have to do one for TikTok now, to get votes from TikTokers. Fine, just do it. I think we can just use the same video. You can't use the same video. You have to do a trend. Do you not watch? No, you're right, I do. I'm a big TikTok fan. That's what you said, right? Come on, let's just do it. Like we practiced. We practiced this? We've had reports of a red-eyed, Luciferian beast in the woods. Now, originally this is something that I said I denounced, I did not believe. We have some weirdo calling show at night, and they're willing to go ahead and justify bringing up this nonsense. And at the time I thought it was. Our guest tonight. Dr. Arthur Gauntlet. Doctor, what are your thoughts on all these? Is there a connection? I think there's definitely a connection. Granted, I'm a little biased, but I think this is definitely a demon host. I think that these women have looked into the face of evil into this demon host and they just ruined them. Absolutely ruined them. In local news, the formerly missing Ludlow Falls woman, Tracy Anderson has reportedly been transferred to the St. Dymphna mental health facility. Dr. J. Bashiri will be taking over miss Anderson's care at the famed treatment center. Dr. J. Bashiri has been praised for his extensive work in psychiatric analysis and therapy, and has confidence in the continuation of such esteem with regards to the outcome of this tragic case. Tracy Anderson will receive the best possible care she can while she's here. I'm Dr. J. Bashiri, I am the most educated, most qualified person in my field. Despite the government's repeated attempts to strip funding at every possible turn, I persevere and I help these people. On the north part of Ludlow Falls they have erected a black bell and people up there in that side of the community, if they spot red, if there is a sighting, if somebody calls one in, somebody rings that bell. It alerts everybody, get the hell out of there. Go back to your home, get in your car and leave. I don't take any stock in his conspiracy theories about some red-eyed cryptid driving these women mad. I deal in science, not wild tales about some hill person with excessive conjunctivitis. Women are just seeing evil and it's just completely shattering them. And it just takes time for them to rebuild and get some semblance of normal. Although they'll never be the same again. People have been thinking that this might be related to a potential chemical spill at the garbage chemical company. That I can't prove. These are just things that have been brought to my attention. Why do they project in a Latin language? Why would they do that? Well, for several reasons. One, Latin is used by quite a lot of the infernal hierarchy. And two it has historically been used by the church to ward against it. I am a psychiatrist at the top of my field. I will help these people. I am Dr. J. Bashiri. If you're looking at evil and evil is a real force. I mean, people don't like to talk about it, but evil is an actual thing in this world. And you know, the best trick the devil ever played was getting everybody to believe that he doesn't exist. What's up party people, it's your boy, G-string. Welcome back to the channel. We're here doing another Tommy Mavis challenge. Now, did you hear the one where Tommy Mavis tried to high-five the tree? He was left hanging. Now we're here doing the Tommy Mavis, coming out of the closet challenge. Now I see these on YouTube. Everybody's crying, they're with their families just kind of somber, but guess what? We're gonna put a little G-string twist on the challenge here. So come on, let's do this challenge. All right, let's do this. Tommy, Tommy, Tommy, who has no mommy, are you in here? Tommy? Babe, I don't think this is working. In the coming out of the closet videos. They always say you're not alone. But I think, babe, I gotta be alone for this one. We can't fit in this closet. We can't fill this closet together. So, can you make me some dyno nuggies, please? I'll take this from you. All right. All right, let's do this. Tommy, Tommy has no, mommy, are you in here? I think it's gotta be darker than this. Make sure to smash that like button if you want me to close the door here. All right, let's do it. Tommy, Tommy, Tommy, who has no mommy, are you in here? Tommy? Smash that like button. Tommy, Tommy, are you in here? Yo, it's the red eyes! You just got pranked. Yo, it's just my roommate. It's your boy, Little Granny Panty back at it again with another prank. Go subscribe to my channel. Last week we got my alcohol-addicted sister back on the sauce. She was six weeks sober. She's so much more fun to hang out with now. Those are some six shades, bro. Where'd you get them? Yo, I bought them online, but they're from China. So it took like three fucking months to get here and I had to denounce Taiwan. All right, that's it from us. That was about two minutes of content. So enjoy the next eight minutes of blank screen so we can get our YouTube ad revenue. Holy shit, these guys are hilarious. Why'd they ever stop making content? Because those guys are dead. Seriously? Supposedly the ride killed them after they're doing some Tommy Mavis challenge stuff in the woods. I heard that the police found the footage then destroyed it because they didn't want it getting out that there's a demon beast running around town. Ah, you know what? I'm really jealous of you guys. Whenever your murder rate goes up, whenever something crazy happens, you guys get a cool local legend to go with it. You don't have any murder legends back in Chicago? No, no, we just have legislation passed. Well, what do you wanna do? Oh, where's that forest that they were at? No, we can't go there. That's a murder scene. All right, be a buzz kill. People get killed there. So? Okay. What about that place that the PolterGuys went to? That manor, mansion whatever. We could go there, I guess. I mean, no one was killed there. Yeah, no one was killed there. So what's the worst that could happen? You know, if we're lucky that is the place where the PolterGuys had sex with that ghost girl in that tub. You realize that almost everything on that show was staged, right? So? What if it isn't? It'd be my lucky day. All right, we can go. Just promise me you won't do any of that, Tommy Mavis challenge stuff, okay? Of course, of course. I won't do any of that Tommy Mavis challenge. Okay, just don't do any of it, okay? Okay, yeah. I got you. Oh, do you know if uncle Tom would have brought us to do shit like this when we were kids, I would have actually enjoyed visiting Iowa with ya. Damn, this is cool as hell, Becca. Well, this is all you get to see of it. It's not open to the public. Anything's open to the public if you try hard enough. Charlie, think I wanna get arrested? You only get arrested if you get caught. So let's head around back. We can walk around. Whatever you say. Yeah, I told you. Don't see anyone around. No, one's gonna be able to stop us from getting in then. I can't believe I've never been here before. Oh, I can't wait. I don't know how we're gonna get in. Well, there's a door. It's locked, now what? Gimme a second. Charlie. What? The stairs are right here. I don't know if they're safe. Whoa, whoa. It's not funny. It's not that bad, Becca. Charlie. Did he get in? Charlie. Charlie. Becca. I found a door, come on. Oh, quite the security system they got here. God, we should not be in here. Come on, if they didn't want us to be in here, they totally would have made it harder to break the locks. Let's just in and out. Let's make it quick. Come on, this is cool. Just look at this. When else are you gonna be able to see something like this? So they really just closed down one day and left everything like this? Well, they cut the funding and just like that, closed. Everything is exactly the same as the day it shut down. That's so neat. Have you ever seen any of those like Titanic documentaries where, you know, everything's the same exact way that they left it? I mean, it's all frozen in time. Just, you know, exactly how they left it when it sank. Just don't touch anything, all right? Let's show a little respect. In and out five minutes. You know, there are lots of bedrooms around here. Do you think that Tommy guy ever lived here? Don't talk about him. Don't say his name. What? Tommy Mavis. Do we have bears in Iowa? There are no bears at Iowa. Tigers? No tigers either. Do pigs growl? They squeal, they oink. You know what? You sit tight, I'll go check it out. I'm sure it's nothing. I'm just gonna stay right here. I'll let you know if I find anything. Just hurry up. It's okay. Holy shit. It's the tub where he fucked that ghost girl. Not into voyeurism? That's fine, we can do whatever... Yeah, yeah. No, no, no. Oh, don't stop. It's so bad. Look at me, I love it. It's Monday. Happy Tuesday. Happy day. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Okay, yep, I get it I'll go look. Teenage suicide. Don't do it. Oh, this isn't bad. Oh, because suicide is painless, it brings on many changes. Oh, come on. Hey, Tommy. I heard you played high five with a tree and it left you hanging. Did you make the noise? Fucking Christ. Holy shit. Charlie. Charlie Hey, Charlie. Charlie. Charlie. Charlie, it's been like 10 minutes. Charlie, I'm leaving. Charlie. Fuck you, Charlie, I'm leaving. Oh, what? Was that not funny? Are you just gonna leave me for dead? What, did you think I was Tommy Mavers or something? Tommy, Tommy has no mommy. What the fuck? What the fuck? Okay, okay. Becca, Becca, I think it's time to... I think it's time to go. What the shit is that? What the fuck? Oh my God. Charlie. Charlie. I'm coming. In our next story, the body of Charles McGuire from Chicago, Illinois was found earlier this morning at the Edinburgh Manor, the closed down abandoned county home, just outside Ludlow Falls. The Ludlow Falls police department has not released any statements in regards to the cause of death. If you have any information in regards to the death of Charles Maguire, please contact the Ludlow Falls police department at 277-3962. West of the falls caller you're on. And now, now we got some boy here, dead from Chicago. I mean why the hell do you even come out here? Oh, you're gonna go legend tripping. Oh, we're gonna go see some weird out in the boondocks, ooh. Well, I tell you what? You should've stayed in Chiraq brother. 'Cause you know yeah, the scariest thing you might have out there is some gang banger with a gun, but out here we got demons, brother and they ain't nothing to with. The police have not been honest nor transparent during any of this. We later proved that to be true. Take for instance, those two strange men in black, nobody knows where they're from. Nobody knows why they were here. We never got an official report, why. Why were they here? What was going on? They just swept that under the rug. We have people with theories saying that they were a couple of religious henchmen or bounty hunters. We never got an official story. Get a lot of these dangerous, dangerous men. You know, 90% of rapists are men. 82% of all murderers are men. And so, I mean, just do the math, you kill the men, I think we only got good people left on this planet here. For some of you guys that are worried, if you're not one of the bad men that are out there raping and killing, you'll probably be fine from red. Weather sponsored by Gurvich Chemical Company. Today's weather and Ludlow Falls is a crisp 60 degrees with low humidity. Temps will remain in the 60s with scattered showers on Friday. There was also those two hypebeast influencers, their bodies found. We understand that there might be found footage. Their cameras were still rolling. That is what the reports are saying. We know this because they went live before that stating that they were gonna go out there, the north end of town. If their cameras are rolling, we should be able to see that footage. Give us the footage now. Why would some Chicago kid be here around Edinburgh Manor. Like why would you be slinking around there? No, not too sure, what they call it, but something tripping. Oh, he's probably doing that legend tripping stuff. Yeah, that makes sense. East of the falls caller, you're on. You know what? I like Red. He seems to kill all the bullies and it makes all the mean girls in town go crazy. And it absolutely terrifies me 'cause we need more of these white men dead. The oceans are absolutely just littered with straws right now. But you hear about like a ghost story and something, so you go there. So he's probably heard about like Red and was like, "Oh, let's go mess with Red." No, you stay away from that stuff. Damn city people, they don't get it. You stay away from that stuff. You stay away from Edinburgh Manor, stay away from Orange Junior High. You stay away from those places, you're gonna have a nice life, gonna die an old man. And that's what you want. You don't wanna die young. No. East of the falls caller, you're on. I just want everybody to look at Gurvich Chemical Company because I think they have created some sort of gollum, which is their word, not mine, which is kind of like a Jewish boogeyman, 109. Well, I mean it'd be 110 now with Afghanistan. What are we gonna do in their names? What about Kenyon Jones? What about Tina Adams? What about Cindy Schlozman? What even about John Baker? Why have they not freed him? This whole world's going to hell. We're witnessing the damnation of this nation. There is another missing person reported in Ludlow Falls. Becky McGuire of Ludlow Falls was reported missing earlier this week. And authorities are asking anyone that has any information on Becky McGuire to please contact the Ludlow Falls police department at 277-3962. No matter how low or how heartbroken you can get in this world, remember that Jesus is always around you. Can you go to heaven if no one loves you? Tommy, Jesus will always love you no matter what. As long as you have faith in Him, He's willing to forgive you anything as long as you put your trust and faith in Him. Can people be mean and rude to you in heaven? No, nobody will be mean, nobody will be hurtful to you in heaven at all. People around here will. When they go to heaven, they will be mean. The Lord is close to the brokenhearted and saves those who are crushed in spirit, Psalm 23:18. Pastor, thank you for joining us today. This is Professor Qurell She is a top demonologist. Our bishop trusts her and our order considers her knowledge and insight in this matter with very high regard. Professor. Minister. Well, based on the report from Isaac, we have a young man. Tommy Mavis is my greatest regret. He was neglected, mistreated and abused in this cruel corner of the world. And I failed him. I failed the weakest member of my flock. Deus mortem, that's will of death, What is that? Well, basically, it's a suicide pact that one would make with a demon and it allows it to become one with the host, therefore giving it an immeasurable amount of supernatural power and physical strength. I've been placed here by my order to monitor this. Two of our brothers, the two men that you met, men of faith, two paladins sent by our order to exorcize this demon and save the boy. They were brutally killed by it. So you think that Tommy Mavis committed suicide in order to seal this pact with the demon called Rumsah. This host is far more powerful than any we've come in contact with before. The demon does come with an angel voice. Sympathetic vision, soft voice. You know, now that you mentioned it, I do remember a conversation where he did talk about being visited by an angel. Who are you? I'm a friend. Do you need a friend, Tommy? I don't have any friends. I will be your friend, Tommy. Are you an angel? I used to be. Your eyes are red. So are yours. Have you been crying, Tommy? Yes. People can be mean, very, very mean. Can't they, Tommy? You're no good, Tommy Mavis. Your parents didn't even want you. You come from a low class of awful people. You are the worst duck, Tommy. You're lucky that a good Christian woman like me even tolerates you. You are ugly. You smell. Freak. No one wants you here. Go off to the woods and die. What are you gonna do without your parents? No one likes you Tommy Mavis, no one wants you here. Tommy, Tommy has no mommy. No one likes you, Tommy Mavis. Again. That's the wrong answer. I don't have all day. It's seven, one two three four five six seven. Not that hard. Why is everyone so cruel, Tommy? No one should be allowed to be cruel to a good little boy like you. Look at you, you're so dirty. You're gross. I could never be cruel to you. I love you. And I will always be here for you. One day when you're old enough, I can show you a way to be so strong that you can punish all these people. I'll be waiting for you on the other side, let's punish them all, Tommy. Give us this day, our daily bread and lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from evil for thine is the kingdom and the power and the glory forever, amen. A demon comes with a whisper. We have a bullied, abused, neglected boy in foster care. Our order has monitored this entity in this area for centuries now. For, I am convinced that neither life nor death, nor angels, nor demons, not the present, not the future, nor height, nor depth, nor any power on this earth can overcome the supreme power of love that God shows us through his son, our savior, Jesus Christ our lord. Now with local news, volunteers are welcomed to join the search party for Becky McGuire, a Ludlow falls native, who was reported missing earlier this week. Those wishing to participate in the effort are encouraged to sign up at the Northwest fire department on Present Drive. They're never short on volunteers. I wonder why that is. I mean, it's always people willing to help. Well, I mean, look at the last couple that they found, I mean always, you know, young women, nubile, scantily clad. Yeah, they are always running around in their underwear. Yeah, yeah. You gotta be a real piece of shit to sign up for that if that's all you wanna see. It seems like it's just taking advantage of them. Right? I mean, there's a poor woman in a deranged mental state and she doesn't know what the hell is going on. She's barely got any clothes on. I mean, it feels real... It feels dirty, you know? Yeah, sure it does. I mean, I signed up obviously. When did they tell you to be there? They told me to be there at two o'clock the day after tomorrow. Yeah, they told me that too. I mean, I just wanna help though. Yeah. I mean, obviously it's just to help. Obviously. Is Red sexist? You know, in some ways I would have to say absolutely not. He is targeting males, being a male. But in another way, is he taking jobs away from some of the female serial killers out there by targeting some of these men? Would Jodie Eris have the spotlight that she has, had Red come in and taken out from underneath her? I don't know. It's not my place to say. I would just like... I think he's got a good place. You know, he's coming from a good place. When he kills these men, I don't think he's thinking, "Oh, no woman could do this." I think he's thinking like, you know, "Leave her alone." "She said, check your privilege." That's what he's doing is basically checking their privilege for them. Becky McGuire, the missing Ludlow Falls woman has been found and is alive. Members of a search party located McGuire this afternoon on the rural gravel road, D13, just north of Ludlow Falls. Police have reported that she is in stable condition and receiving medical treatment at St. Gerard Alamo hospital in Ludlow Falls. St. Dymphna mental institution in Ludlow falls will be closing its doors permanently after the state has cut mental health funding, yet again. All current patients that were receiving treatment at St. Dymphna will be transferred immediately to the state mental facility in Reliance, Iowa. We reached out to fame psychiatrist, Dr. J. Bashiri, in regards to the closure of St. Dymphna. The budgetary concerns at St. Dymphna mental health institution are no longer of my concern because we have been closed. I've been talking about the lack of funding for years. Nobody cared to listen while I was continuing to work and help. It's fine. I understand that these women that I've been treating have been moved to the state facility under the supervision of one Dr. Block. Yeah, we were at undergraduate together. It's safe to assume he still has a ponytail. He's a very nice man, but let's just, you know, to be Frank, I can neither trust or respect a man who got a C in anthropology. Because of the fact that St. Dymphna hospital closed, they quit paying orderlies. They quit paying all the staff, everybody down to the janitors, everybody. When that happened, that made their NDAs, non-disclosure agreements, null and void. If you're not getting paid, why keep the secret? I wish we could divert some of the funding from some of these sports that everyone seems to be so enthralled with and puts them back into the wellbeing and mental health of our young men and women. State representative Dickingham, I have to ask a actual question that the community wanted me to follow up on. Now, you have voted for a new football stadium and to increase the pay of the head coach. How can you justify that allotment of money in the state's budget when you're shutting down mental health facilities in this area? Well, can these crazies learn to block or tackle or run a ball or... I've been a bit at a loss of what to do now that I can no longer use my exemplary talents to help people, just what I've been trying to do this whole time. So I'm trying to focus inward. What does Dr. J. Bashiri love? Entomology. Which is the study of insects, for the layman. And of course my biggest passion, the restoration of Victorian-era Wicker furniture. I will focus on these hobbies of mine and hope that these women receive the help that they deserve, that I, unfortunately, can no longer provide them. Any additional physical restraints? Restraints seem to distress her. I think the room will be adequate. Yeah, I concur. If the government lied to us about one thing, why wouldn't they lie to us about the next thing and the next thing and the next thing, and the next. Tech offensive, Tuskegee syphilis experiment. Building seven or nine 11 was not hit by a plane. And why no video of a plane hitting the Pentagon? Maybe the earth is flat. Who can trust anything you've been told at this point. Have you ever noticed that every girl named Michele is crazy? Think really hard about it. Do you honestly know a single sane one? I guess it's really just my parents' fault since they named me Michele, or whoever convinced them to name me Michele. I wonder who convinced them to name me Michele. You need to check and recheck things again and again. I don't see what is wrong with that. What if you were wrong and the stove was on and people died because you didn't check it. I just think it is being careful. And there's nothing wrong with just being an extra attentive and careful, nothing wrong with that at all. Yeah, I messed up my hand, but if I were named Kyle and had a lifted truck, he wouldn't even bat an eye. But oh no, we can't have an angry little woman. Cameras. I found them. You found them, did you keep them? I flushed them. Oh, you flushed them. Can you describe what they looked like? You already know what they look like. Gabby, I don't believe you found any cameras. There are no cameras, Gabby. There are cameras, literally everywhere. Gabby, we've been through this before. You claim you find cameras, yet you never show them to us. Why would I show them to you? You're just gonna take them back. Why would we have cameras, Gabby? Why wouldn't you have cameras? You gotta keep track of where everyone's at all fucking the time. But you know where security cameras are. They are not hidden. Yeah, that's kind of an obvious thing. Don't you think? I think you wanna keep us drugged up. Do you feel drugged up? I think you should lower my dose. It's been 64 days since I've had a dose change. I feel that your dosage is appropriate. In those 64 days, your mood has been more stable, you've had less bouts of paranoia. I feel the medication is working. Why? Michele, you're not hearing the voices. Or if you are, you're not telling us. Michele, do you miss the voices? No. Denise, tell me about your morning. My morning wasn't too bad. I didn't really have a lot of freakouts compared to normal. Everything, almost everything was in order. There wasn't anything wrong with the breakfast. There was the perfect amount of butter on the toast. It was honestly a lot better than... She took long in the line again Hold on. I'm so thankful, you're giving me the opportunity to share. You're welcome. She's taking long in the line again. She's lying to both of you. She's counting everything. The amount of stroke she does with the knife with the butter, the amount of time she puts the butter on the toast. Just grab the shit and go to your spot. It's not that hard. Calm down. Well, if I ate at the time I'd like to eat instead of waiting behind certain people, maybe I wouldn't be as elevated. Stanley you gotta try this metaverse thing out. You can make Tilda Swinton's hair whatever color you want. Wait, oh boy, we're on. Yes, we're on. And as you saw last time on our social media pages, we are once again, live to bring in the poll results of where you want us to go next in this haunted world that we call the world. That's right? We tasked you, our fans, to decide where we're gonna go next on a very special episode of The PolterGuys. Is it going to be the bears, Chicago? Is it going to be Paris? Or would it be Cabo? Let's find out. George, do the honors. We are going to be bringing the results in. We have not seen these yet. We want you to experience along with us, you loyal, loyal, loyal, loyal, PolterGuys viewers. What we experience when we see things for the first... George. Here they come. Chicago, Paris. And with a beautiful 5%, it looks like we're going to Cabo, mate. Ludlow Falls. What? Why would we go to Ludlow Falls? Ludlow Falls. It's right behind me. Isn't it? Ludlow Falls is right behind me. I don't wanna go. It was the writing. I told you, we shouldn't have a write in. You're the one who put the write in. I know. From the TikTok video. Remember? I know I was trying to make it seem like it was your fault but it's mine. I wanted to go to Ludlow falls. We've heard terrible things happen there, mate. I already know that, George. I've got an idea. What? We cut this, we edit it. We can't cut it. We're live streaming right now, to all of our wonderful fans. Oh, what's up. Peace and love Look, here's what we're gonna do. We're gonna go to Ludlow Falls because the Polter fans want us to go there and we are gonna freak out beans and get so nasty with all the nasty ghosts there. You're gonna see more stuff than you've ever seen in your... Thank you so much to our loving and adoring fans that care only about our wellbeing and not for what's best for the TV show. So baptism of the dead. Is that what this is called? Baptism of the dead. I would consider it a proxy baptism or a vicarious baptism. I don't think my order would condone Mormon practices. Well, in the early 1900s, there was a local holy man who he came in contact with a demon, much like this. And he said that he was able to significantly weaken it by blessing the snow when it would fight in the winter. The bishop sent Isaac and Gus to burn the tree where he committed suicide. He sent them the bus lands to try to weaken it. And the devil who had deceived them was thrown into the lake of burning sulfur where the beast and the false prophet had been thrown. They will be tormented day and night, forever, and ever. Revelation, 20:10. Only a Christian of pure faith and soul has a chance to exorcize or baptize this thing. If you see it, run. Let us pray in the manner that Jesus taught us to pray. Our father who at in heaven, hallowed be thy name thy kingdom come thy will be done on earth as it is in heaven give us this day, our daily bread, and forgive us our sins as we forgive those who have sinned against us, lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from evil for thine is the kingdom, and the power and the glory forever, amen. Welcome to The PolterGuys. Welcome to The PolterGuys. Stanley. Welcome to The PolterGuys. Welcome to The PolterGuys. All right, put it back. Welcome to The PolterGuys. Are you gonna do it? No, you said no. I like it, the fans like it. It's a little bit of fun that we love to have. Welcome to The PolterGuys. Stanley. God damn it. Welcome to The PolterGuys. We are back for the final time at Orange Junior High, where we have encountered the mysterious Red, many times. Now it was not our idea to be here, but the fans', because of a certain online poll that was posted. Right. Someone in our camp, our team, and shouts out to the camp, they put a poll up that said, where did you like us to go? And you all wrote it in Ludlow Falls because you're all a bunch of. Now we will be staying here for one final night to get the most compelling ghost activity captured on camera that we have ever, ever, ever seen. And Stanley, I think I speak for both of us when I say I hope the activity starts a little bit later in the night and this time. And not just... Oh God, it's happening already. Did you see that? How ironic. Run, run, run. We are now on the third floor, where will we be staying when nothing is going to happen until it gets a little bit darker out. Stanley, Stanley, Stanley, watch. Cool. Let me try. Finally, some peace and quiet. In the maths room. Yes. Jesus Christ, it's Red. I don't know if you can see this at home but, it might be hard to make out but you could probably see that that's the Red. All right, you know what? What? We're gonna defeat evil. Evil gets defeated tonight. Evil gets defeated tonight. Evil gets defeated tonight. Stanley, get out your bible. Here. Thank you. Stanley, this is not a Bible. It's my Bible. I read it religiously. You know, I do believe that. Anything can be anyone's religion. Viewers out there, your friends and family might think you're strange for believing in some type of... I thought he was here. He's just so silent. I know, he's a fan. In his cosplay. You like cosplay, yes. Here sweetheart, give him a shirt. Hey, thank you for being one of our biggest fans. And a big fan needs a small shirt. That'll never work. Try that. What's this? Three XL. Okay well, here you go. It's always nice to meet a fan. Oh look at that You look great in that. He loves it. We love you. We love you so much. Hey, quit it. Hey, he's not a fan. Hey, wait a minute Cosmetics, pharmaceuticals, household polymers. Gervich Chemical is a world leader in the material sciences. We bring decades of experience to the forefront to make the world of tomorrow, today. And why do we do that? Because we're Gervich Chemical Company and we care. Stanley. Oh God, no. George. Stanley, as I live and breathe you've saved me life. And I know you'd do the same for me, George. Oh, Stanley. George? I think about it. You're my best friend. Yes, yes you are. Hey Red, eat this you slimy bastard. We can't die we're "The Polterguys". Let's never come back here. And I mean it this time. We're never setting foot in Ludlow Falls again. I keep saying it for ratings, but I don't wanna come back. We're not doing it, mate. We're not doing it. No, we're not doing it no more. I can't feel my ass. My legs are broken. Well, shall we? Edinburgh Manor, Orange Junior High, and the north end of town. If you are in those areas, get out. Nothing good has happened there in the recent years. Some of the most violent crime I've seen in any of these pictures. Any of these stories being reported back to us of what happened, have been some of the most frightening and disgusting things I've ever seen or heard. East of the falls caller you're on. People, you need to stay away. Stay away from this place. Stay away from the old Orange Junior High School. It's Red. It's Tommy Mavis. They call him Red. If you look at him, the guy will just smash your head. And everybody just stay away. I mean, you're messing with trouble, okay? It's a bad deal, I'm telling you. Today's weather will be a comfortable 50 degrees with temps staying in the 50s all week. Local weather provided by Gervich Chemical Company. If the police really wanted to do anything to help that community they'd call the national guard and they would wait post at every single one of those spots and ensure the people's safety. And I know what you're thinking. You're thinking I'm calling in martial law like I'm some sort of trader. No, this is a real big deal. They should slash and burn that whole north end of town. Clear it all out. All even-steven, get rid of that. And I know I'm gonna catch shit from little environmentalist hacks. They're gonna say, "Oh, he's talking about the decimation of area." It does not matter. People are dying. Get over your tofu-flavored bullshit. So it was written by this egg head out at MIT. It's called "The Industrial Society and the Future." Great read. You need to definitely read it. Oh read in hell. I should be writing my own manifesto, "How to stay alive in Ludlow Falls." Oh, hell yeah. Hell yeah. You could distribute it and people could actually not die. That'd be great. Yeah. Or better yet, how a book, "How not to PISS off Tommy Mavis for dummies." Oh yeah. You know, they just gotta leave him alone. It's like... Okay, let's say there's a tiger and it's over there, And we're over here. These people are like, "Oh, let's go fuck with the tiger." "Let's go poke his balls." No, you don't do that. You leave the fucking tiger alone. No, there's no ball poking. No, there ain't no ball poking. No. Come back to God. Come back to the scripture. I beg you come home to Jesus Christ. I leave you with Psalm 34:21. Evil will slay the wicked. The foes of the righteous will be condemned. Love kills the demon. We should love one another, you know. Well, you know, I love you. Oh. No, no, no. Not like that. No, no, no. Not like that. Not like in a cowboys in a tent sort of way. Like platonically. Platonic. Yeah, not like in an ideal form sort of way, but like friendship, like a brother sort of thing, you know? That would take care of the demon. It would. Drive out the demons, freely you have received freely give that is from Matthew 10:8. Tom Mavis is not dead. He is going to punish you all. All you self righteous people, you are all Christian hypocrites. You are all Christian hypocrites. Read the book of John verse 19 and 20. "Whoever claims to love a god" "yet hates a brother is a liar." Ludlow Falls is a sinful place. The fear of the Lord prolongs life but the years of the wicked will be shortened. I saw into his eyes. I saw hell. Hell is coming for you. Tom Mavis will bring it right to your precious Ludlow Falls. Evil shall slay the wicked. Ms. Anderson is in her padded cell reciting sermons on fire and damnation from morning until night. What do you wanna do? When she gets to Revelations, we'll up her dose. It just really fucking pissed me off that they turn off the "Golden Girls". They know the TV is supposed to stay on late, especially on Thursdays. Thank you for sharing that with the group, Jill. Becky, today the day you'd finally like to start to share with us? Vengeance is mine. I shall repay. Vengeance is mine. I shall repay. That's the translation of what I was saying when they found me. It's Romans 12:19. It also was written in Tommy Mavis' suicide note. The demon is called Raumsa. I'm lucky. It's easy to have faith when you've seen it. Well then it isn't really faith at all, is it? It's knowledge. I don't wanna go back. I don't wanna go back. When you look into his eyes, you only see one thing. Hell. I don't wanna go back. Raumsa. Oh Lord, how often have we prophesied in thy name? In your name, cast out demons. In your name done great work. Tommy. Tommy Mavis. If you forgive others their transgressions the Lord will also forgive you. Tommy, let this go. Forgive. There's no need to punish anyone. There's no need for revenge. In our next story, a gruesome scene out of Ludlow Falls. Earlier this morning, the remains of several men were found in a wooded area near Insanus Ravine just off of the north edge of Ludlow Falls. Authorities have not released any official information in regards to the identity of the man in this apparent mass homicide. But eyewitnesses have detailed a very disturbing recount of the findings. Agents from the Federal Bureau of Investigation have arrived in Ludlow Falls today and the governor has ordered national guard troops to the area. Remember your creator in the days of your youth, before the days of trouble come. That the years approach and you will say, I find no pleasure in them. Ecclesiastes 12:1, "be aware and vigilant, we are but sheep," "and evil has arrived."
