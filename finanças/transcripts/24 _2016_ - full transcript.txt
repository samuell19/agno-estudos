Go Heaven's gates are open for you Go and meet your father there Ask him Your mother will also welcome you Ask her too When you ask them focus on their eyes The fear in their eyes will tell you Who Athreya is! "Ayushman bhava" "May you have without strife a long and healthy life" "May you live long Healthy and strong" Ayushman Bhava! Did you see his lifeline? It stretches a mile long! Such a tragedy to die so young - Mithra - Sir? Remember the hologram? To charge the watch... ...the wearer of the watch must pass electric current through his body Even in death he is useful Mithra I'll travel 26 years into the past now History, achievements, glory, challenges met in this world... ...shall surrender under my feet! Come here You touch the watch too I want you too along with the lost memories of all these years Come We shall time-travel together Project Twenty four Mithra Sir? Sir I can't believe it, sir I was right next to you And now I'm in my house! 'Mithra...?' Sir That watch I swear- 'Mithraaa!' Sir, what happened!? He defeated us Sethuraman has won Why do you think he named it 'Project 24'? This watch can only take us back in time for 24 hours 26 years It cannot take us to even yesterday or tomorrow! What do we do now, sir? To fix this properly There is only 1 person in the world Mani Sethuraman's son But we killed him, sir Only now we test his long lifeline! Look at the date Note the time now We've come back to the same day Our Independence Day has dawned again! We haven't killed him as yet He's at home fast as sleep 2 points to keep in mind How did he even find out about us? The advertisement He came after he saw it He will come He must not see it As of now, he knows nothing about us That advertisement shouldn't be published in any paper tomorrow 2nd point to note When he wakes up... ...the watch should be on his wrist Otherwise he will suspect something is amiss 'Today is August 15th' 'Not just our city, the entire nation is celebrating Independence Day' 'They have organized various programs' 'Husband endrosed his wife's secret lover!' Which is the freebie? Either one can make me happy Watch? On this hand? How is it on this hand? Mithra Sir I did what you asked me to I hope he didn't see you No, sir If he saw you... ...then all our efforts will go down the drain I know I'm sure he didn't see me But I saw him On his wrist was the watch you invented I looked at it closely It's working But the real shocking-surprise is... ...he is a carbon copy of you Heard that, Priya? Our son Resembles me Like a carbon copy Let him resemble me in appearance But I sincerely pray...his life... ...should be nothing like mine And that is why... ...even though I know he is here I have kept myself away from him But a father's heart aches to hug him, Priya I wanted to check if he was okay, just once So I had sent Mithran He is healthy and happy it seems... ...and surrounded by good people As his parents... ...what more can we ask for? How, sir? If I fixed the watch on the wrong hand... ...how did you guess right he would follow me here? If he is Sethuraman's son... ...I am Sethuraman's elder brother! This is quite a huge task Do you think he can do it? Only he can do it Not having seen his father or known his father's profession ...he grew up as a bright lad But now Look at the profession he has chosen for himself He is a watch mechanic Sethuraman's blood runs in his veins He will definitely do the impossible! If we simply ask him to tweak the watch Or threaten him Will he do it for us? I shall go I shall enter his life as his long lost father I'll tell him about his mother And make him yearn to see her again I'll tell him the cruel story of how 'Athreya' destroyed his family Then he will do it for 'his father'! You saw how emotional he was seeing his mother's photo For his biological mother He will do it for her He will do it to cure 'his father' I'll make him do it! Mithra Any fool can use the watch while it is on his hand Without even wearing the watch watch how I get my work done! I can't believe it My son has suddenly become enlightened He has got up as early as 6 in the morning! Must thank the good spirits! I don't want to jinx it Son? What's wrong? Mani...? What happened? Why are your eyes red? What happened? Ma- I'm not dying to know who these people are I'm asking because it pains me to know I may not be your son Who are we, ma? This is your father As you grew up... ...I realised this looking at your face He thrust you into my arms and changed my life forever You asked who we are Let me rewind to my past Our family is well respected in our village My father, brother, sister-in-law Very close knit family I was the apple of everyone's eyes My father believed girls should also be educated And contribute to our society So he sent me to a nearby city to study One day I got a letter from my father He had found a suitable groom for me And asked me to come back at once 'This journey would change my life's path forever' 'I didn't know then' I saw your father, hurt all over, carrying you as a baby in his arms 'He gave you safely into my arms' 'I have promised my wife our son will not be harmed' 'But I am not in a position to uphold my vow' 'You should save my son' 'He said this and he rushed out' 'I never saw him again' My father came to the station to receive me Along with my brother, sis-in-law, the groom's family members And all the kith and kin we ever knew A real big crowd When they were all waiting for me... ...I alighted with a baby in my arms Everyone was shocked including my father People jumped to conclusions If a girl is sent out of town to study before she is married... ...this is how she will come back Their comments were below the belt When I recall their harsh words even now I feel heavy hearted Everyone at home fought with me It was almost like world war 3! 'Will our villagers digest this even if we believe you?' they asked 'Will the groom to-be accept this baby?' 'Will his family agree?' they asked I told my father 'Father, a promise should never be broken, come what may' 'You brought me up to follow this strictly' 'I gave this baby's father my word I would take care of him forever' This is what I told my father These were the last words I spoke to him till date I carried you to my room You cried the whole night wanting to be nursed I couldn't bear your pain and I wept too Finally I decided Without becoming a mother I nursed you myself That is when I realised the value of motherhood I forgot I was a daughter I decided to be your mother I did not want any problem to arise because of my son So I left the house I was born in From that day onwards... ...you are the centre of my entire universe Let me confess now Like you did to your biological mother... ...you did not kick in my womb But for 26 years, I have carried you in my heart! I am your mother Whatever anyone may say I am your mother Let them say what they want I am your real mother Amma Don't cry, son Look at me Take me to your father I have to tell him I promised you I would take care of your son I must tell him I've kept my word Take me to him 'Mother...father' I lost them before knowing the meaning of those words That isn't a big deal Because ever since I can remember... ...you have been my mother, father, my everything But you... ...lived for 20 years with your parents You were brought up with such love and care You gave it all up for me You raised me all by yourself Who can be more important to me than you, ma?
