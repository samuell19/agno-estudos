In only 12 months, the band had achieved five top ten singles and three top ten albums on the American charts, outselling The Beatles. They had appeared on the legendary Ed Sullivan Show and played over a million people across America, including the hundreds of thousands gathered at Woodstock. John, Tom, Stu, and Doug may not have had the familiar ring to it of John, Paul, George, and Ringo, but Creedence were challenging The Beatles for the title of the biggest group in the world. This is Doug Clifford, who plays drums for Creedence Clear water who's been there since the start, which was how long ago? Eleven years. Stu, have you ever run into a situation where you didn't like one another or you had a very, very bad argument? Yeah. We checked our equipment quite frequently. John Fogerty, you write most of the material for the group. What was the first gold record you had? "Proud Mary." Tom, uh, how would you characterize this music? Rock and roll music. In April 1970, Creedence arrived at Heathrow Airport to begin their first ever European tour. The tour would include concerts in Berlin, Stockholm, Rotterdam, Paris, and London. The band's British debut was to take place at the most prestigious music venue in the UK, London's Royal Albert Hall, which had previously hosted concerts by The Beatles, The Rolling Stones, Led Zeppelin, Cream, and Jimi Hendrix. For Creedence Clear water Revival, the Royal Albert Hall concert would be a high point of their tour of Europe. The concert was filmed, but never fully released until now. This is also the story of how they got there. My impressions of Europe? Well, I like it. It's, uh... it's my first time. And, uh, we're going through so damn fast. Each country is definitely each country, man. Like there's no, like, you know, Sweden and Denmark as close as they are in all their respects, there's really two different worlds. And I can see that just having been here just a day and a half. The excitement, it's just... it's like a dream. I don't wanna sleep. Uh, because number one, I can't, I'm so excited and it's just like living a dream because I've lived in America all my life, and now coming over here, things are, you know, physically different and the people are, you know, mentally different. It's a whole fantastic experience. It's total excitement when you walk out on the stage, you're thinking that these people don't understand English.

You get the same reaction in Rotterdam that you get in Oakland, that you get in LA, that you get in Omaha, like there's something happening. The real test as to the success of their European tour would be measured by the reception they would receive at London's Royal Albert Hall. The journey that led to this landmark concert began 13 years earlier in El Cerrito, California near San Francisco. It all happened one day. The first day in junior high school, there was this guy sitting in the back of the class, just screwing around. And, uh, all the seats were taken except the ones next to him. So I just fell down and sat next to him, it turned out to be Doug. Hello there. Like we were good friends for a couple years before we even, you know, got into a music thing at all. Then John… John was tinkling on the piano, then in the music room to like audition people who are interested. Yeah. We started out as a... like a... As a trio with piano, drums, and guitar. You have to understand, like we were the only band in the school. It wasn't like how it was after The Beatles when it seemed like every school had 50 bands, we were the band of the school. The instrumental trio, John Fogerty, Stu Cook, and Doug Clifford initially went under the name, The Blue Velvets. They became a four piece when John's older brother, Tom joined on vocals under the name, Tommy Fogerty and The Blue Velvets, they released a handful of singles that helped build their reputation around the Bay Area. Then during February of 1964, their world was shaken by a hurricane that had blown in from across the Atlantic. ♪ Well, shake it up, baby ♪ ♪ Now, shake it up, baby ♪ ♪ Twist and shout ♪ ♪ Twist and shout… ♪ So in '64, we'd already been together five years. And our listening experience, the kind of stuff we were into was pretty much similar to The Beatles. And when The Beatles hit, we said, wow, you know, the door is wide open again, 'cause The Beatles really just changed the whole thing for all musicians. The month after The Beatles heralded the start of the so-called British invasion, San Francisco's Channel 9 broadcast Anatomy of a Hit, a television program that told the story of "Cast Your Fate to the Wind" by jazz artist, Vince Guaraldi. This single had been a hit for Fantasy, the San Francisco based record label. Having watched the documentary, John and Tom Fogerty crossed the Bay Bridge and played their songs to Max Weiss, Fantasy's co-founder and resident hipster. I have perfect pitch and natural rhythm. And just by one listening of just a, maybe four or five bars, usually five bars, uh, I can spot whether a record's gonna make it or not. Impressed by what he heard and no doubt aware of the tremendous success of The Beatles in the growing beat group phenomenon, Weiss signed the group to Fantasy. Wanting the band's name to sound more British, the label opted for a new one unaware of its offensive racial connotations. Thought it sounded British, Beatle-ly and all the rest, and that was the reason trying to emulate the English thing. As their sound evolved, Stu Cook switched from piano to bass, Tommy Fogerty to rhythm guitar, and John Fogerty assumed the role of lead vocalist. And by late 1966, it was beginning to look like the group was on the verge of a breakthrough. ♪ I got me A brown eyed girl ♪ ♪ Yeah ♪ - ♪ Brown eyed girl ♪ - ♪ Yeah ♪ But with the escalation of the Vietnam War and the shadow of the draft hanging over young men across the States, the group's progress was brought to a halt. John Fogerty enlisted in the army reserve and Doug Clifford served in the coast guard. During this period, the musical spotlight had shifted to San Francisco, in what would soon explode into the Summer of Love. It exploded while I was gone, San Francisco just broke wide open and everybody was talking about it and I was away. I like Country Joe and the Fish. And the Jefferson Airplane, Quicksilver Messenger Service. Well, like, uh, the local groups that have been playing around here, I've been seeing 'em for a long time and, uh, they're really making it, they're doing a real good thing, man. I got out of the army in, uh, '67 and we sort of resolved to really go for it. To either we were... we were really gonna commit ourselves and everything we had or else we weren't gonna make it. A major turning point was the release of their single Porterville. It didn't just sound like the work of a different group, it pointed the way forward. ♪ It's been an awful long time ♪ ♪ Since I been home ♪ ♪ But you won't catch me goin' back down there alone ♪ ♪ Things they said When I was young ♪ ♪ Are quite enough To get me hung ♪ "Porterville" showed John Fogerty's determination and growing confidence as a songwriter. And it was around this time that they were able to rid themselves of the name that had been originally suggested by the record label. They became Creedence Clear water Revival. We've been together all this time and nothing was happening with the group. So we decided we wanted to have a little revival among ourselves. That's what that part meant. It's just let's get back to the basics, you know. Let's get back to where we were 10 years ago. When "Porterville" failed to make an impact on the charts, Creedence resorted to a formula that had provided many groups with breakthrough hits. They've recorded a cover version. The band decided on "Susie Q," a song that had been a hit for Dale Hawkins back in 1958. ♪ Oh, Susie Q ♪ At first, it was just a demo tape that we took to a local FM station, and they started playing it a lot like four, five times a day, in exactly the same form that it appears on the record. The excitement of actually really hearing your song on KYA, uh, after years and years, some nine and a half years, of trying, it took... it took us pretty much by surprise when it happened, because it just took off. And wisely, the man at the record company finally saw, "Oh, well, these guys are getting popular. Maybe they should make an album." So, um, we got to go in and with, um, something like seven or eight hours of studio time, uh, we made the first album. The budget was like less than $2,000. First album was released and we came to San Francisco and we started playing there and it's like it just fell together real fast, but we've been working on it for about nine years, you know, getting ourselves together so that when we... When we had it together, like, all we needed was an audience. Having broken on to the San Francisco ballroom circuit and with their album hovering just outside the top 50, they were hoping to take things to the next level with another cover of an R&amp;B classic. ♪ I put a spell on you ♪ ♪ Because you're mine ♪ ♪ You better stop the thing That you're doin' ♪ ♪ I said watch out, I ain't lyin' ♪ Screamin' Jay Hawkins did "I Put a Spell on You." And that's another great old R&amp;B song that I loved. It happened to fit my vocal style. I could... I could sing that well and that was the reason, uh, we decided to do that particular song. It's kind of hard for me to talk about John and be unbiased, you know, because, uh, we're in the same band together, but I think that he had one of the most unique voices. I think it's right up there with Ray Charles and Van Morrison, you know, it's a voice that's distinct. Despite showcasing his development into one of the era's most recognizable voices with a style rooted deep in the blues and R&amp;B, the record failed to reach the top 50. John Fogerty had said that he wanted Creedence to make something for the ages, to be great like The Beatles. On the day that he received his honorable discharge papers from the army, he wrote his first genuine classic. ♪ Left a good job In the city ♪ ♪ Workin' for the man Ev'ry night and day ♪ ♪ And I never lost One minute of sleepin' ♪ ♪ Worryin' 'bout the way Things might have been ♪ ♪ Big wheel keep on turnin' ♪ ♪ Proud Mary keep on burnin' ♪ "Proud Mary" reached number two on the US charts, and five years after watching The Beatles make their debut on American TV, they too appeared on The Ed Sullivan Show. ♪ Rollin' on the river ♪ ♪ Cleaned a lot of plates In Memphis ♪ ♪ Pumped a lot of 'pane Down in New Orleans ♪ ♪ But I never saw The good side of the city ♪ ♪ 'Til I hitched a ride On a river boat queen ♪ ♪ Big wheel keep on turnin' ♪ ♪ Proud Mary keep on burnin' ♪ ♪ Rollin', rollin' ♪ ♪ Rollin' on the river ♪ You know, like "Proud Mary" I'm really happy about that, that it came off as well as it did. The way I write is a very loose thing. All I'm trying to do really is put down what I see, you know, the way I see it. Get something out of just hearing the notes and the rhythm. But if the words can convey the same meaning, it's like icing on the cake then, you know, because I try and match the music with the words. It was during that time that I completed, uh, all the stuff on Bayou Country and, uh, some of other songs, too. In other words, that didn't really reflect... The songs didn't reflect my mood at the time, you know, I just switched off and went into something else. If "Proud Mary" was about a riverboat rolling up the Mississippi, "Born on the Bayou" took you on a journey through the swamplands that stretched from New Orleans into rural Louisiana. ♪ When I was just a little boy ♪ ♪ Standin' to My daddy's knee… ♪ At the time of the release of their second album, Bayou Country, none of the band members had yet set foot in the part of the American South that was so vividly captured in their songs, a great achievement for a songwriter whose roots lay 2000 miles away in Northern California. ♪ And I can remember The Fourth of July ♪ ♪ Runnin' through The back wood bay ♪ ♪ I can still hear My old hound dog barkin' ♪ ♪ Chasin' down a hoodoo there ♪ ♪ Chasin' down a hoodoo there ♪ I, like, haven't lived there, uh, you know, in the south, it was purely that was all in my head really, like, that was where I wanted to go. And all the things I had heard before that I dug were from there. And it was like, I wanted to be like that, you know? Creedence never bought into the idea of turning on, tuning in, and dropping out. For them, it was always about the work. And to reflect their identification with the working man, they called their rehearsal place The Factory. Now, we come down here every day, we rehearse, talk about music or what's happening, you know, with other groups or other records. As well as writing the songs, John Fogerty was also producing the records. The Factory was where the songs took shape. As they saw it, simplicity was best and less was usually more. Like, when we make a record, I don't... I don't maybe listen to the... Really listen and get into the words, until maybe a month after we're finished, you know. Like, I don't sit down and take it all apart, you know, I just, uh, you know, one line or one word does it for me. ♪ I see the bad moon a-risin' ♪ ♪ I see trouble on the way ♪ ♪ I see earthquakes And lightnin' ♪ Three months after releasing "Proud Mary," Creedence were back on the charts with "Bad Moon Rising." This song would also give them their first UK number one. ♪ There's a bad moon On the rise ♪ Do you feel that the group is going in the direction that you want it to go? Yes, but just not fast enough. Um… Yeah. There's really no other way to say it, you know. I would dig it if we all woke up tomorrow morning and we're just superb musicians, you know, who could play anything, but it never works out that way. ["Cross-Tie Walker" playing] By mid-1969, Creedence was arguably the second biggest band in the world behind The Beatles. And that summer featured among the headlining acts at the Denver, Newport, and Atlanta music festivals. ♪ I went down to the station ♪ ♪ Just to take a ride ♪ They were also approached to perform at the upcoming Woodstock Festival. Creedence was one of the first, if not the first major act to sign. You know, they used us to entice other artists of our generation to get on board. We were signed to headline Saturday night. The day before their scheduled appearance at Woodstock, they were in a Los Angeles television studio recording a performance of "Green River" on The Andy Williams Show, a showbiz institution, a world away from outdoor festivals and the counterculture. ♪ Well, take me back down ♪ ♪ Where cool water flows, y'all ♪ ♪ Oh, let me remember Things I love ♪ ♪ Stoppin' at the log Where catfish bite ♪ ♪ Walkin' along The river road at night ♪ ♪ Barefoot girls Dancin' in the moonlight ♪ The song is, uh, like, uh, just a little segment of John's child... John and Tom's childhood, uh, when their father used to take 'em up to the, uh, Cody's camp. I mean, it's, uh, part of the lyric. The place isn't there anymore. Like progress, they built a dam, flooded the... you know, backed the river up and flooded out the whole place. I think that, you know, the camp, everything's gone except the song. I like the place that that song is supposed to be coming from. "Green River," I always thought, was like the heart and soul of what Creedence is. Uh, musically and also just kind of what it's talking about. Having honored their television commitments, they then traveled to Upstate New York to take part in what would turn out to be the most historic music festival of all time, Woodstock. [guitar solo from "I Put A Spell on You" playing] We're just overwhelmed by, uh, the enormity of... But we had no idea of what to expect. And the weather and technical problems pushed the show later and later. We finally got on about 3:00 in the morning. ♪ I put a spell on you ♪ ♪ Because you're mine ♪ ♪ You better stop the thing That you're doin' ♪ ♪ I said, watch out, I ain't lyin' ♪ We didn't consciously go out of our way to try to sound like a Black band. You know, there was parts of country and it's just that… That was really that we liked Black music better than the kind of white music that was being presented to us at the time, but, um, our early heroes were definitely Black, so I think it kind of maybe just unconsciously came together. ["The Night Time is The Right Time" playing] - ♪ You know, the night-time ♪ - ♪ Night and day ♪ - ♪ Oh, is the right time ♪ - ♪ Night and day ♪ - ♪ To be ♪ - ♪ Night and day ♪ ♪ With the one you love, Oh, oh ♪ ♪ Night and day ♪ - ♪ I said the night-time ♪ - ♪ Night and day ♪ "Night Time Is the Right Time" was originally recorded by Ray Charles and would feature on Creedence's first number one album in America, Green River. I've heard it and I've experienced it, and it's real. And in fact, it's played on the Black station. It's being played on the Black station, and like the deejay there was really pushing the record and the people were digging. My old lady and myself, we were thinking of coming to work the other morning and I said, "Hey, wait a minute, you know, like those cats are for real." So, like, it doesn't matter, you know, whether they're a white group or not, like, they're really coming from within. You dig it. And when you come from within, you got to be for real no matter what you are. - Yeah. - Yeah. Green River occupied the top spot for three weeks before being replaced by The Beatles' Abbey Road. While the record was still on the charts, Creedence were back in the studio recording what would be their third album in less than a year, Willy and the Poor Boys. ♪ Down on the corner, out in the street ♪ ♪ Willy and the Poor Boys Are playin' ♪ ♪ Bring a nickel, tap your feet ♪ ♪ Rooster hits the washboard ♪ ♪ And people just got to smile ♪ What set Creedence apart from many of their contemporaries, was their ability to produce the sound of their records, on stage and the primal excitement and joy of their concerts, which came from their love of live performance. ♪ Down on the corner, out in the street ♪ ♪ Willy and the Poor Boys Are playin' ♪ ♪ Bring a nickel, tap your feet ♪ It has an elating effect on you.

Like it's the fear of, like, blowing it and the excitement of being able to do it at the same time. If we're all working together, boom. You know, it's just fabulous and everybody's turned on. If you do turn them on, you really feel rewarded. And that's really the reward. That's the only reward that counts, I think. ♪ Just to hang around ♪ ♪ But if you've got a nickel… ♪ Besides people looking for your music, they also... well, they wanna know what you think, they wanna know what you wear, and, you know, what movies you like, and do you eat spaghetti for breakfast and junk like that.

You can tell how a person is by, you know, looking in his eyes and just how far behind his eyes his brain is, is where he's at. You know, if his brain is right up there, you know, if his head's right up there behind his eyes and he's... you know, John will talk to him. We go around talking about how we're communicating but no one ever does. It's like you look right into a guy's eyeballs and you're staring. You say, you know, "Are you in there, you know? Hello?

And in this year alone, Creedence had accomplished more than most groups managed during a whole career, including four top ten singles and three top ten albums. To emphasize this success, Rolling Stone magazine declared them best American band. The outsiders from El Cerrito, had come a long way. And 1970 began with a celebratory concert on home turf, in front of 15,000 ecstatic fans at California's Oakland Coliseum. ♪ Keep on chooglin' ♪ ♪ Keep on chooglin' ♪ ♪ Keep on chooglin' ♪ ♪ Chooglin', chooglin' ♪ ♪ Chooglin', chooglin' ♪ ♪ Maybe you don't understand ♪ In America, Creedence were flying high, and three months after their victorious Oakland concert, they took their show to Europe. Their European campaign began on April 7th when they touched down at London's Heathrow Airport. ♪ There's a place Up ahead and I'm going ♪ ♪ Just as fast As my feet can fly ♪ When we got to London, we were just destroyed. Eleven-hour flight and a nine-hour time difference. It was like when it was night, it was morning. You know, you get so tired that you just can't sleep. And then, just immediately went out and got on a double-Decker bus and just started cruising through London. Creedence's highly anticipated sold-out concerts at London's Royal Albert Hall would take on even greater significance when just days before news broke that shook the world. The event is so momentous that historians may one day view it as a landmark in the decline of the British Empire. The Beatles are breaking up. With the London audience reeling from the news of The Beatles' breakup, Creedence was now poised to take on the mantle of the biggest group in the world. My biggest fear, man, if these people are gonna boo us off. You know, you're not sacred. If you ain't making it, you... The first cat's gonna... you know, everyone else think it's like The Emperor Wears No Clothes. Finally some cat'll go, "Boo," and pretty soon the whole place will just tear you to pieces, you know? There's a lot of pressure on John and there's a lot of pressure, I guess, on all of us, because I wanna live up to what John expects of me. And hopefully because we've practiced a lot and we have improved anyway, you know, just… Evolving as musicians, we want that to happen. You know, it's four parts that make up a whole. Every once in a while, you really... You really know together, you know? It's like four people are one. In other words, if something... If something goes wrong, hopefully, instead of getting uptight, we'll just remember that time in Omaha or that time in Lodi.
