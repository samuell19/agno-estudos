[music playing] -When one of the-- when one of the kids is in a fight and starts to cry, the first thing I tell 'em to do is take a couple of deep breaths. Then I tell them, think about it, you know, just like I'm talking to a fighter. I'll say, think about it. I say, is that crying going to get you any more points? Is that crying gonna make the judges feel better for you.? I said, if you-- if you want to cry, you can go home to your momma and cry. You're in front of hundreds of people here, and you're bawling. You're from the best boxing team probably in the West United States, if not the nation, and you're bawling. You-- you're here with 14 or 15 studs that are tough, that train five days a week, two hours a night, four miles. They sacrifice their friends, their pleasure, their going out, and you're bawling from-- it's-- it's not just you in the corner. I said, you are the boxing team. If one guy bawls, it's just as good as the whole boxing team crying. And I don't want no crybabies. I've had Morgan fight. And he-- it was only like his fourth fight. He was fighting an awfully good fight. He got hit once hard on the nose, real hard. He thought it broke his nose. He come back to the corner. He was bawling. He was bleeding. My nose is broken! I slapped him. I grabbed him by the head, shook his head, and said, Morgan, you're in front of a lot of people here. And the boxing team's sitting right there. You gonna let these guys know that you're beat already and you got two more rounds to go? I said, OK, the guy might be a little bit better. He might be a little better boxer. But he doesn't have the-- he hasn't been in the gym every day training like you. He hasn't been pumping like you've been pumping. He hasn't been doing what you've been doing. But if you want to give up now, I'll throw the towel in and we'll let everybody-- and we'll all go home. And everybody will be saying, oh, jeez, Morgan was-- jeez, Morgan pussed out. Morgan pussed out. You're on the best boxing team around. You gonna let-- you gonna let these guys down? And all the sudden he stopped crying. He shook it off. He went out there and just beat the shit out of the guy. We win a decision, and he goes home. [music playing] -This is an imitation of Andrew coaching one of his fighters. Jeez, man, what's wrong with you, man? You're backing up all the time. You don't-- you don't want to back up and shy away from him. All you're doing, you're not punch or anything. You're not scoring anything. You just get in there. You just fucking keep your hands right here and move after him. You're making all these moves, making real nice moves, but then you're backing up. You're not throwing anything off of them. Get in there. You make a move. You throw something off of them. Look sharp! Don't look like a pussy. -Andy, uh, when you bring a girl to his bedroom, what do the girls usually say about this bedroom? -Well, when I bring a girl-- [laughs] Oh, wow. When I bring a girl to this bedroom, the-- mostly the first thing they-- they talk about or that they see of course is the trophies. You have, as you can-- as you can kind of see, I got a small, small collection here. Actually, this isn't-- this isn't all of my trophies. This is a-- this is an accumulation of some of my most favorite or my-- the best ones that I've won over the-- since I was an amateur. I have an awful lot more. I have boxes of them that I just don't have room for in here. But, uh, just for example, oh, here we go. This, uh, this trophy here-- careful. This trophy here is the Oregon AU Novice Championships November of 1970. When I was, uh-- when I was younger, my stepmom, Mary, would, uh, would have my name engraved on them and the-- and the date, 11/7/70. This-- this is when I won Outstanding Boxer from the very-- from my very first tournament that I ever boxed in. And, uh, you know, I had five fights. And I-- and I won them all. And I won an Outstanding Boxer trophy. I didn't really know what it meant at the time, but now-- you know, obviously I-- I kind of know now. I thought I had my very first trophy that I won stacked up in here, but I-- but I don't. That's one of-- that's one of my most-- my most prized ones, there, this one here, along with, of course, a lot of them here. This-- this trophy here's when I won the National Golden Gloves. I have a pair of snakeskin cowboy boots-- a little interesting story-- I have a pair of snakeskin cowboy boots that are in my closet there that my dad-- that my dad told me if I ever won a national title that he would give me, buy me a pair of snakeskin cowboy boots. And, uh, I finally-- I took five or six tries, and I finally-- I finally got the shot and finally-- finally won. So now I get-- got that. But this is-- [ringing] -Oh, there's-- oh my god, it's my duck. [ringing] -Yes, this is a telephone. Hello? Yes. Yes. How you doing, Mom? Oh my goodness. It's my mom. [laughs] Oh, if you only knew. [laughs] Hey, Mom? (LAUGHING) We're kind of busy. We're kind of busy. OK. Oh, OK, great. All right, see you later, Mom. Bye. [hangs up] I know it's hard to believe, but I got a duck for a phone. -Minsker comes right back out with that good straight left jab and has scored here early on Franklin. On the inside on-- on this one, and jabbed this way into the body. We are indeed here in the ring with Andy Minsker, a slightly disappointed Andy Min-- Andy Minsker, if I read you correctly. Uh, you said, darn it, or words to that effect, after the fight-- nothing too bad, folks. And I think it was because you had things going your way very well early, and you won the fight. But maybe the last part of that fight didn't go the way you'd like it. -Yeah, so I felt the third and fourth round slip, and I-- I got-- I got real fatigued, which was, uh-- you know, it's kind of-- it worried me a little bit. After the second round I was started getting fatigued. And I thought maybe I just over-trained. Maybe I was-- I picked up my running for the last-- the last few weeks. And, uh, I just think I over-trained. I just was training way, way too hard. Too many rounds in the gym, and maybe too much roadwork. If I may, I'd like to take this opportunity to thank Bob Arum at ESPN for televising my fights. And I'd like to say hi to everybody back home. OK. -So Andy, tell us what your mom said on the telephone. -[laughs] She calls up, and she goes, Andrew, Andrew, I'm having a nervous breakdown, she says. I told her about-- I told her yesterday that-- that-- they'd want-- that people would be coming over there and maybe doing a little bit of, uh, a little bit of sound work, and-- or a little bit of filming work and stuff like that. And she-- and she goes, oh, no, no, no. She said, I don't want-- not over here, not at this house. She goes, you can't have them come over here. And I go, Mom, I said, this means an awful lot to me. And you says, uh, she says, well, I'll borrow Gertrude's house. This Gertrude, she's a friend of the family's. She lives right across the street. Got an immaculate, just an immaculate house, just stuff in it you wouldn't believe. And she, uh-- and my mom has always wanted her house, wants all her furniture and everything. You know, if she ever goes, she wants to make sure she gets her furniture stuff because it's all old and it's real nice. And, uh, my mom-- my mom's nervous as anything about-- you know, just about somebody coming over there. Wait till I tell her that-- that we're going to show up at the barbecue. She'll probably go crazy on me. She's, uh, she's something else. Get a load of these people looking. They-- they look-- they probably think I'm some kind of movie star. [laughs] Tell you guys about my-- my roommate, Martin Mernand. We call him Marty. He's the, uh-- he's probably what you guys would call the classic womanizer. I mean, anything and everything that's female, from eight to 80, he'll hit on. And that's a promise. When I moved in with him, he told me that-- he told me, Andy, if you just do one thing for me, just don't ever hit on Joanie. He says, that's all I ask. Even if we're not going out or if we're fighting, just don't ever hit on her. And I said, all right, Marty. I-- I said, I won't, you know. And-- And I've been with-- I've been alone at the house with her for a lot of times, and I-- and I never hit on her. And, uh, you know, I was kind proud of that. I have a lot of respect for Marty as a friend. You know, if you can't trust a friend, who can you trust? So anyway, I, uh, I got to know Tassie. And I've been going out with Tassie for a year. Anyway, one-- one day last week she stops by the-- she stops by the house to drop off a birthday present for my cousin, Two Bit. And Marty was there. And she come in and-- there's ABC Plumbing. That's my uncle's truck! My uncle owns that plumbing business. Anyway, he was talking me down, saying I was cheating on her and going out all the time and that I never treated her right and that he could treat her way better and he could really show her how a woman's supposed to be treated, and this and that. Got her talking, you know, got her thinking, you know, got her pissed at me, basically. And then, uh, he asks her out, gives her his phone number. There's a '57 four-door wagon, or a '55 four-door wagon. Anyway, so he's talking away, talking, talking me down, talking shit about me. And this is supposed to be a good friend of mine. I've lived with the guy for a year, known him for six years. I mean, we've told each other lots of things that he'd never, ever tell, you know, anybody else. And this guy-- and he-- and not to mention that is that he's talking behind my back. He-- he's saying that, you know, let's go out, Tassie. We'll just do it behind his back. It'll be fun. And this is supposed to be a good friend of mine, you know? Now I don't know what the hell to think about him. You know, what the hell do you do with a guy like that? He thinks with his dick, is what he does. -I went up to Spokane with my team, and I fought-- I-- I was really nervous before we got into the fight. I was really nervous. I had my hand wraps on and everything. And I went in. And I thought my guy was going to be really tough, see. So I went in there, and, um, he was. And he's a little fat kid, and I mean, I'm going, him? I'm going, what? Am I supposed to fight him? I mean he's really-- looks really easy to fight. I went in there and, um, I was planning on knocking him out. Well, I didn't knock him out. As a matter of fact, he was pretty tough. So I went in there, and um, hit him. And he hit me, gave me a bloody nose. And I-- I thought I-- I thought I really had to fight. And so I didn't really-- I had faith in myself, but I didn't-- I won the fight. And-- and, um, at the end of the fight I was sort of bragging and saying, yeah, I beat him. And, um, so I went and my trainer-- my trainer told me not to brag as much as I did. And-- and it made me real embarrassed. And so I remembered it the next time I fought. So, that's all. -Somebody would more than likely be driving this '57 off before I give up that boxing team. It's kind of hard to explain, but them little kids just kind of grow on you. And once you get hooked up with them, there ain't no backing out. [hitting sounds] -Go ahead, go ahead. Just keep working. Just keep working. There you go. You got to make them effective. Just do it another way. Don't open up. There you go. There you go. Hold on a second. You ever noticed your hook's coming around your head all the time, instead of coming right here, right where it should be? You swing and he comes around your head all the time. Right here. Here's his head. Your hand's out here. You've got to look at what you're punching at, and it's got to be shorter. If these are your clothes, you'd better hop from here, not down here, not way down here. [hitting and punching] -There you go. There you go. Nice box. -Nice moves. -Nice moves. -Hang on. Hang on. Aiming, aiming, same thing, different principle. Go down there. This hand's here. This one's down here by the body, and this one's right here. Then you step away and you're right here. Nothing's up here, nothing. It's right here. If you're down here, you can pull this one back. When you're up here like this, you can't do nothing to me. You're going to go down there and get it in there, get in there. Damn quick coming back at the mean time. Not down here. [bell rings] -Yeah, bloody hooks. [hitting and punching] -There you go. Keep your hands moving. Keep your hands moving. All the time. There you go. There you go. Keep walking. Keep walking. There you go. Keep it going. Keep it going. There you go. Nice move. [music playing] -Thing that I enjoy the most is how they look up to me, and how they trust me, they trust in my judgment, on what to do and how to do it. They-- they brag about me. If some other coach is saying, yeah, I've seen Minsk fight, they'll come up and they'll defend me just as quick as anything. And being a two-time national or three-time national champion, I know that they have the confidence in me. If they're getting out-- if they go out there and they're getting their ass kicked, and they come back and I say, I want nothing but left jabs this round, and if you throw another punch I'll swat you when you get back to the corner, 12 out of 12 guys will go out there and that's all they'll throw. The respect from them is amazing. If I ever have a son, I certainly won't push him to box. Of course, I always hope that he will. I boxed two years before I finally figured out that my dad had boxed. My dad's love for it was so great that it was somehow inbred into me. [music playing] -You know, my dad-- my dad told me that if I ever-- when I was living with him when I was a little kid, I got in a little altercation at school. You know how kids in fights at school. My dad told me if he ever-- if I ever got in another fight outside the ring, he'd take me downstairs. Because, you know, he thought-- maybe thought I was going and picking on guys or something. But he said if he'd take me downstairs and we'll put the gloves on. And I certainly didn't want to do that, because my dad-- you know, I have all the respect in the world for my dad-- most of the respect in the world for my dad. Always wanted to ask you this question, and just-- just for the hell of it. Why-- do you think I-- do you think that I deliberately tried to follow in your footsteps through boxing? Or do you think that-- do you think I'm doing it now because I like to box, or because I'm just trying to follow in your footsteps, or try to do better than-- -Well-- -You did when you-- -You've gone farther-- you've gone farther, you know, with your boxing career than I ever did. -I mean, as an amateur, you know, I think I already told you that was my goal to meet or beat-- -Well, yeah. ---your best. -That was the promise. And you remember what I told you what you won the ABF-- or the National Golden Gloves? -I told them about the boots. [laughs] -No, I mean, that was just, you know, that was something that, uh, that, uh was part of it, you know? -[laughs] -If-- if-- if anybody has a son, I'm sure that they would like them to pursue a career in their father's footsteps. But you've-- you've exceeded what I-- what I did as an amateur boxer. But you've been at it-- you've been at it longer than I was, too. -So your looking at a boxer here that in 1954 was the Olympic alternate due to politics, basically. I heard it from his coach. I've heard it from a lot of other people. Now you're looking 30 years, exactly 30 years later, in 1984. You're looking at another Olympic alternate. -Politics got to be, in 1954, as the politics got to you in 1984. -I think my was more-- more so a little bit worse, because I won the Olympic trials. I don't know if-- did they, in '54, did they have box-off? -No box-offs. -When you won the Olympic trials-- -You were-- you were the Olympic champion, represented the United States. And that year-- -In the Olympic games. ---people went to Finland. I could have went to Finland with them, and I decided-- I decided not to under the circumstances. And I probably-- I don't feel that I made a mistake. But my mother was-- people that remember back in 19-- during the late '50s, the early '50s and the late '50s, the Iron Curtain was-- was coming down. And there was lots of problems in that part of the world. And my mother just put her foot down and said, no, you're not going. So that was one of the reasons. Plus there were some other factors that entered into the thing why I didn't go. -See, I also had an opportunity to go as an Olympic alternate. I also had an opportunity to go to the training camp. They wanted me to go to the training camp to help the kid that they-- they pushed into the Olympic games, to spar with him and get him ready to win an Olympic gold medal. -There was a lot of things-- there was a lot of things involved-- -Yeah. ---in this-- in this. -The racial-- racial things is what I'm almost positive, racial-- the racial thing, the black and white-- I think that had a lot to do. See, I was the only white boxer to win the Olympic trials. The only one. -There's so many things that I've wanted to-- that I've wanted to get out about this that-- that it's just, uh-- you know, it makes you sick, as much time and effort, effort, money, whatever you want to call it, that we've invested in this thing in the past five years. You know, and to have it go down because somebody besides the training people that were training these kids had-- well, they got the final say. They know who's going to win and who isn't going to win. There's no doubt about that. If anybody that's close to it knows, you know it before hand-- -They know who they want in there. -They know who they want, and they-- they do whatever they have to to get what they want. And there's big money behind it. They were looking at big dollars in Meldrick Taylor, Pernell Whitaker-- -Breland. -Holyfield, Mark Breland, uh, Biggs. I mean, it's, you know-- they're all black, and, uh, and the people that are behind them are white, and they've got lots of money. And that money is what, uh, you know, what-- what talks. It says it. -See, if our fighters make the Olympic team and they win, you're looking at a lot of-- that's what they're saying, that you're making a-- that we'll donate $1 million, $1 million, $2 million to the United States Amateur Boxing Federation. You know, they're not telling that we want our guys winning, but they're telling them-- -All that's-- all that's said is-- -Lot of money involved. ---is that there's a big donation coming. You know, so what-- you can't-- there's no way getting around it. You just-- -They're looking for themselves, of course, you know. I think that if the Eastern Bloc countries would have been there, I would have been-- I would have been on the Olympic team. Because they wouldn't have chanced Meldrick Taylor going, because he's so young, taking a chance on getting beat. I think they had the confidence in me that I could have beat the Russian, the Cuban, whoever. You want to know the story, it's actually had-- they had the Olympic trials. They had a box-off to box-off to see who got to fight me. What they did was they had Bernard Gray and Meldrick Taylor box off at the training camp, in a closed session where just the boxers got to watch, to see who got to fight me in the-- in the actual box-off to see who was on the Olympic team. So they went through two or three steps. Bernard Gray fought Meldrick Taylor in the box-off at the training center in Colorado Springs, and in my opinion, and in all the other boxers' opinion, beat him and beat him soundly for three rounds. And he didn't get the decision. They gave Meldrick Taylor the decision. And he's who I boxed in the Olympic-- in the box-offs, and which I didn't get a chance to prepare properly. It's an excuse, sure, it's an excuse, but it's a legitimate excuse. They told us that-- that I would sacrifice my spot on the Olympic team or a chance to box-off for the Olympic team if I didn't go to the training camp. Well, I went to the training camp and got there, and half the boxers didn't show up. But they still got to box in the Olympic box-offs. I got seven rounds of sparring in three weeks to prepare for the most important fight of my life. They're the ones, the Olympic training center and the coaches and everything, they're the ones-- and they wouldn't allow our personal trainers to come up and help train us. They wouldn't allow it. If my dad would have came up, or Ed would have came up, they wouldn't let them in the gym. They wouldn't let them train me. And consequent-- but Emanuel Steward had three or four guys there. He was the head coach of the team. So his boys are all taken care of. He flew in guys for his boys to spar to prepare for the fight. I managed seven rounds of sparring in two weeks to prepare for the most important fight of my life, and I lost. I'm not the most emotional guy in the world. I never have been. Never-- you know, I can remember twice in my lifetime ever hugging my dad. And-- and those two times were basically when we were hunting. He shot a deer one time when I was a little tiny kid. We went out on one day, and just he got a deer, and he hugged me and said, we did it. You know, and it was just me and him. And it was snowing. It was kind of-- you know, I'll remember it always. -Mr. Minkser, Andy didn't think you were going to show up here today. -Well, as you know, I've got-- I've got some obligations that-- that it's tough for me to, uh-- tough for me to turn down. I got to make a living. I got to get going to college. You know, and it's expensive. And, uh, and I'm not a great provider. But, uh, you know, I got to keep-- I got to keep at it. And I've got a wife that works full-time, too, and that's the only way that we can-- that we get our boy through college. And before he started college, the majority of what we spent was on this guy right here. That's why I went to all the flights and flew around the country. It was a joint venture between-- between my wife and made to be able to make these trips. And Andrew wonders why I haven't been to these professional fights. Uh, I'll be truthful with you, I can't afford to. I can't afford those $300 or $400 flights once or twice or every month or so. I-- I'm just not in that category. I wish I was. I wish I could afford to, you know, travel with him and spend all the time with him, but I just can't do it. And I know-- I know what the situation is. -I-- did I not, though-- correct me if I'm wrong. I offered to pay your way over there, fly you over there. Billy said he'd fly you over there. -Well, the thing was, the offer-- this is-- this is new to me, see. I never heard anything about it. I wouldn't have accepted it, for-- for one reason is I don't want to be obligated in any way, shape, or form to-- to any of that bunch in-- in Las Vegas. -There's no obligation there. -Well, yes-- -We just wanted you-- wanted you-- I wanted you there to watch me fight. -Yes, I realize. I realize that, Andrew. But, well, we'll go back. We'll go back a little bit farther, when we went down and-- and made the deal with your manager. I felt at that time, you know-- you know how I felt about it. -Yeah. -I wanted to-- I wanted you to find a trainer. You know, and you didn't want to go along with that. You said no. -Here it comes. -Well, hey, I'm telling you. Because I-- I knew from experience what was in line for him. He could be-- he could make $1 million real, real easy if he had the right people behind him helping him, doing the things for him. But he didn't-- he was too young. He didn't understand this. He didn't understand the massive thing that was there for his grabbing. And now I feel bad that I didn't maybe insist that he-- that he get the right caliber of a manager-- -Just-- ---or a trainer to start with. -To me it was just that how can you-- how can you-- you know, now I realize that I should have done it, of course. And I'm looking back and saying, I wish I would've done it. But how do you tell him, an old guy like Ed, who's trained me since I was eight years old-- -But Andrew, no let's get-- let's get back to the point now. Let's start-- let's start over. -Well, how do you tell him you don't want him to train me no more? -OK, now wait just a minute. -I'm too good for him. -Who-- who trained you the last two years of your amateur career? -Nobody. Or you. -Well, all right. All I was doing was-- and we did-- we did more. I spent the money and traveled and went. And I didn't want to get involved in the training in the professional thing. All I wanted you to do was find a good professional trainer to train you. And that was the whole thing in a nutshell. And-- and I feel that you-- that you-- that you've lost the opportunity. Maybe not. Maybe it's still there. -Lost what opportunity, to find a good professional trainer? -No. -For what, then? Just kind of hard to swallow, you know, being with a trainer for 16 years and all the sudden telling him that he's-- I'm the one that has to tell him to go up to-- that I'm not going to be the one, or that I'm going to be the one that has to tell him that he's not going to be my trainer anymore. You know, it's-- it's just not-- it shouldn't be me the one that should be telling him. It should be the people that are-- that are saying that he's not the one for me. Because Ed knows I love him. And I'm sure my dad knows I love him. But, you know, some things are just too hard to do. How long ago was it, Ed, that you-- that you met my dad or even knew of my dad? -Well, I'd say a long time ago when he was a very good amateur boxer. When I first met him I think was about 1948. -'48? -1948. He was boxing. -(LAUGHING) I didn't know he was that old, Ed. -He was boxing for Multnomah Athletic Club. And he, uh, he was beginning to come up in-- -Hello. -Hi. -Hi. -How are you this evening? -Fine. -Been better. -What can I get you? -I'll have a-- I'll have a Stroh's. -Stroh's? -Yeah. Ed, Stroh's? -Black coffee. -Oh. -I'll have tea, iced tea, please. -He won't have nothing. -He can't have anything. He'd go to sleep again. -OK, I'll be right back. -Thanks. -Did you ever-- did you ever fight against anybody from the Multnomah Athletic Club? -Yeah. Yeah-- -Did you ever-- were you and my dad even close to the same weight class? -No. -I don't even know that. -Your dad was a little guy. I was quite glad. -(LAUGHING) "I was quite glad." -I was about 147 and he was 118. He fought in 118, 126. He would go and he'd box top-rank boxers all the time. I remember when, uh-- -Thank you. ---when he neat a national champion. It seems to me that the man's name was Martinez. -Are you Andy Minsker? Sir? -Oh, don't start that. No, no. I can't. -Oh, I can't believe it. You're here! -Oh, no. -His face is turning red. He's embarrassed. -I'm flabbergasted. I can't believe it. You're here! I saw you fight in the, uh, the Olympic trials in '84. -Thank you. -Oh, it was great! -Thanks. -Look at me, I just can't believe you're really here. -Yeah, I'm really here. [laughs] -You know, I just can't believe it. -Yeah, neither can I? -Can I ask you a favor? -Sure. -Can I have your autograph? -He probably can't write. -I know this is only a drink ticket, but I'd just love it. -Sure, I'd be more than happy to give an autograph. -Oh, thank you. -What more can you possibly ask for? Hey, this is the only-- -More? -Don't you think you oughta have yourself paged, too? -It's the only reason that I'm fighting. It's to who? -Armida. -Spell it. -A-R-M-I-D-A. -There you go. -Oh, thank you so much. -You're welcome. -Can I ask you just-- -Hey. ---one more? -Yeah. -Can I have the honor of giving you a kiss? -[laughs] -Now, watch this. -Oh, I knew this-- why'd I know this was coming? Sure. Thank you. -Oh, thank you. -My coach is sitting here. I can't-- don't worry, Ed, I don't know her. -Well, Ed did a good job with this man. God, I love it. Well, you have nice evening. -Thank you. -Thank you. -Bye. -"Thank you," he said. See what happens? You hit good. Kiss all the girls, too. -You won more tournaments. The very first tournament that-- that you won as boxing 60 pounds-- -50, Ed. 55. -Was it 50? 55. OK. You know, I knew your dad quite well. And I knew he was a tall kid, you know. He was always kind of a string bean kind of a guy. -Thanks, Ed. That's me, too. -When I-- first time I saw you, you were kind of low to the floor, and you had your collar turned up. I thought, man, that-- he isn't built like a national champion. I don't-- you know. But as time went by and I began to know you a little better, why, I could see you had those fast reflexes. And-- and, uh, you had-- we-- we tested you out kind of early to see whether you had any heart. Yeah, you had some heart. -Donny Parks tested me out early. Donny Parks beat the shit out of me for-- for weeks, for months on end. Every day I'd-- Chuck and you'd make us spar with them guys. I had tears in my eyes every night when I left that gym. Every night, I'm telling you. They were-- I didn't like it. -Remember how we used to go to the fights. And a lot of the kids had to go to church Sunday morning, so we'd get out of bed and we'd take the kids to church. And you were one of them too. -Yeah, I remember having to go to church. -Then we'd come back. And we'd have kids that would be scared, had to sleep with me and Ed. -Yeah. -Yep. -And it was-- sometimes it was pretty-- pretty bad. Sometimes we even had kids get their feet stuck. When we went to Boise, Idaho. -Remember, what was his name? Brent? -I don't know. We rode on the train. We rode all night. -What was his name? It wasn't-- his name was Brent or something, wasn't it? -Yeah, he lived over in Milwaukee. -Man, this kid [inaudible]. -His feet stunk. -You think Randall's feet stink. This guy's feet stunk so bad-- we were going on a train to Idaho. His feet stunk so bad we were in-- we were in a room. We had to have him set his shoe-- we made him, Alex and-- and Bob Neukom-- -They beat him up. -Yeah, we'd get him down, say, you're gonna wash your damn feet. -Made him wash his feet. -We'd make him wash his feet, set his tennis shoes out in the hall. People would look out in the hallway and say, what's that smell? His feet stunk so bad. Remember that first day I came back when I was 16? My hair was-- I mean, my hair was down to here. And it was in front of my eyes. It was down over my eyes, bushy. -In those days, in the '60s when the Beatles were all growing hair and everybody showed up with a head of hair, nobody could see. And there was always a chance of getting eye damage, because you'd get hit with a haircut. And, uh, it was a-- it was frustrating to me. I was-- now you see you with this Jack Dempsey thing again. And that's just, it's amazing. The world's really progressing. -I'm getting old, Ed. -Yeah. -I'm getting old. I mean, look at this guy. You know why, Ed, why all these kids-- why Damien, last year, he started last year, he had his first fight in January, and by June he beat-- he beat Eugene Washington with 90-something fights on his seventh fight. And he didn't just beat him, he kicked the shit out of him. And you know, the reason he's so good and-- -Because he lives at the gym. ---all my kids are so good, is he lives at the gym, and he's-- and it's because I'm teaching them. I have all the confidence in the world that I'm teaching them. But you know what I'm teaching them? I'm teaching them everything I know. And you know where I got everything I know. It makes men out of them real quick, huh, Ed? -Yes, it does. -I like boxing because, um, I want-- I like doing something, doing something and staying in it instead of just playing over in people's houses and everything. I think Andy Minsker always looks dirty and scrungy and looks like he has zits, and-- and I think he's very ugly. -Aaron, what do you think your toughest fight was? -Um, when I lost. -Aaron-- -Have you ever had a fight that you thought you won but you really lost? -Yeah, at the Old Moose Lodge when I fought the guy from Warm Springs. How about you? -Um, uh, yeah, when I fought Nathan at the, um, match bout. -Yeah? Was that a close fight? -Uh-huh. Everybody thought I won. -Um-- son of a bitch. [laughs] Um, what an asshole. [music playing] [laughter] -This is my-- this is my famous, uh, Grandpa Dean. -Hi, Grandpa! -You know high school, like high school letterman's jackets and letterman sweaters and stuff? -Yeah. -He started making those letters and stuff in the basement of our house on 26th and turned it into a great big-- a huge company. He's-- this man, he's the money maker in the family. [laughter] -And he also golfs a lot. -He's a golfer. [chattering] -Yeah, it was great. -Dad's a golfer too, though. -You know all the award letters and stuff? I remember when I was a little just-- well, I can't even remember how old I was. -It probably is on the back of your sweater as we speak. -How old was I when we lived in the house on 26th? I was young. It was before I started boxing, so it must have been-- I was six, seven years old? -Four, five. -Four, five, six, seven. I remember there were-- they had a bunch of machines in our basement of our house on 26th, and they were always sewing up them letters, them award letters. I remember, I had a whole-- I had a whole big box somewhere of the letters to go through. -Yeah! -Yeah, what was that, boys? [laughter] -That was Jill. [chattering] -Oh, did you bring the new truck? Too good to bring it out here, huh? It might get-- you didn't want to scratch it. -It's bad news to have a big, bad cab. Really, it is. I've got one. -Where's the kid? There he is. -There, get a little Chucky on his camera here. Remember that-- remember that Fu Manchu mustache you put on him? -Oh, yeah, you remember that? See, he's not scared of me. Look, made him smile. -Yeah, he likes you. -You're not scared of Andrew, are you? He's gonna be a little a guy like me. Gonna be like me. He's looking just like me, don't you? Chucky, Chucky, you look just like me, don't you? Huh? Yeah, he's gonna be-- he's gonna be a little guy like me? You want to be a-- you going to let him fight a little bit, maybe, or--? I mean, if he-- if he chooses to do so? All right. Chucky. -You said he's got a good jaw, right? -You gonna box? Yeah, small. See the nice small jaw? They could be winging hooks by him, miss him by that much. Piece of cake. -It'll tear easy, that one. -See, he's already got a couple of strikes there. -Yeah, you want to be a boxer, buddy? Huh? Huh? Look at him. Huh, you gonna be a boxer? Oh, look at that, he took a swing at me, too-- he took a swing at me. -He's got your mouth, the Minsker mouth. -He looks just like me. Look at you, you little rug rat. You look just like me, buddy. -Except he don't have no chew in his mouth. -He can't hear. See this time, he can't hear. -Give him a plug there, Andy. -Chucky, Chucky, want some candy? [laughs] Huh? You want some? Middle name's Drew, right? -It's, uh, Charles Henry Drew. -Charles Henry Drew. Yeah, you're named after Andrew. You're named after Uncle Andrew. Yeah. You don't know it yet. You don't know it yet. -He's still a child. I don't want him to be, like I say, embarrassed, because I'm telling people these things. -He's told us-- -But, see, he would never tell anybody anything about his mother. -And the fact of it is-- is that-- -He turned out halfway decent. -He could have turned out to be, like, the worst person in the world. -He could be one of these kids out here. -Do you know what I mean? And ins he Turn out taking care of these kids. -Yes. We got a midnight phone call from Andrew's mother, telling us that that afternoon the kids had been taken by the Children's Protective division from school and put in a children's home. The teachers had found out because the kids could not sit in their chairs. So they took them to the nurse, who checked them over. And then they called the police. The kids had been beat with a rubber hose, because the stick that the father was using broke. So he got-- went out and got a piece of hose. They were beat because the mother had told them to pick up their room or clean their room, some type of a child thing, and they didn't do it. So he beat them. And it took us about six months, through court, with the systems back then for a father to get custody of his children. But we did get full custody of the children. And they all did come to live with us. They-- they wanted to go back home. They were used to this. They were used to physical abuse. They were used to mental abuse. They were used to being on their own. It was their way of life. At eight years old, that's all they knew. And it was then up to us to try and give them a stable home. And that's how Andrew started boxing. At eight years old, each child was allowed one activity. And that's all I told them I could handle, because we do participate with them. And I couldn't run any more than that. And he decided he wanted to box, because he had seen his father's boxing trophies. The girls had Bluebirds, 4H, Girl Scouts, but he did not want to be a Boy Scout. He wanted to be a boxer. -You think I'm talking out my ass when I tell you guys about the weight? -I don't know, are you? -I said, come over here. Come here for a second. I want to show you something. I want to show you something, baby. -What? -I can see from here. -I want to show you something. -Show me. -Come here! No, you can't see from here. You can't see from here, bitch. -Come on. Come on! You do what I tell you. Want you to come over here, I want you coming over here. -No! -[yelling] You're a real tough guy. You're real tough now. We'll see how tough you are at the nationals. -Ow! Come on, man, you could hurt somebody. Oh, god! Dang! God, ow! -You're strong. -No, I'm-- Ow, I just-- -Ow! Ow! [grimacing] -Got any better than that, you wimp? You 100-pound piece of shit? -You're a 125-pound piece of shit. -Piece of shit? I'm killing you. I'm killing you. You understand me? I'm killing you. -(CHANTING) Drop him, drop him! -OK, OK, knock it off now! Cassie, for Christmas, she gave me these underwear. And she took them to this print shop and had a picture of her-- had a picture of her printed on them. -Drumroll! -Drumroll. -Yeah! -And these guys, they wanted me to film it. And I-- I wouldn't do it. I didn't want to do it. And-- and I was-- and I said, OK, $100 in my hand and I'll do it, because I figured they-- I figure-- I'm figuring they'd say, oh, forget it, you know. And there it was, just like that. -So you did it. -Then they come, so I had to, uh, I had to show them. Incredible, isn't it? -I-- I mean, I like this. All this, uh, joking around is all-- all fine. But, uh, there's, uh, some things like, uh, like what we're talking about, give you-- gives everybody the impression that you're a real ladies' man. And I know that's not really true. -Definitely that's not really true. -But, I mean, if you weren't-- you weren't my son I would trust you with my daughter. Your know, I mean, I don't-- I mean, I-- I think you're a pretty good-- -Am I hearing things I've never heard before today? -No, I mean, you're a good person. I mean, I-- you got good judgment. And the way you treat your parents, you know, that-- that-- that right there is-- -Applause. -No, a good sign of character. You-- you've never been disrespectful. Uh, well, maybe, uh, to the mother, mommy here. -Mommy dearest. -A little smart mouth. -Well, how about the time, Andrew, I asked you-- now, when he-- -To say hi, Mom on camera. -Yeah, to say, hi Mom, Vivian dealing with eight kids. -But you get-- you get-- when I'm in there-- -He gets up there and he goes, you know, I want to thank the Davises in-- -Yeah, but they're the first-- ---Forest Grove. -Yeah, but my girlfriend at the time was-- -Tassie, the one you brought-- yeah. ---from Forest Grove. Yeah. And her dad, I've known her dad for a couple years. -Big time, big time. -And we were real good friends. And that's just the first thing that pops into your mind. Because you don't have a bunch of time-- -Your mom, who carried you for nine months and watched you for, like, all those years? -But when you're in a professional fight like that and you're in there to save your ass, and all the sudden the fight's over with, and you're trying to come down and trying to think of something normal and trying to act fairly sound-- -Mom is normal, Andrew. -Well, you'd think so. -Mom is apple pie. -But how long's it been since I've lived with my mom? -What do you think about when he gets hit in the ring? What is your feeling? You like it? -I think a little pain builds character. I think it's good for him. -Yeah, see? -Oh, I love it. And I-- I'm-- I'm the "I hate." -It builds character. -I hate seeing you get your-- get your face hit. -Maybe I'll get hit a little more, have a little bit of character. [laughs] -(LAUGHING) Yeah, yeah. Maybe I'll do it, Andrew. -No, I've always-- everybody-- Dad, everybody that I've talked to that, you know, that asks me about boxing and everything, they always-- they always ask me and say, boy, your mom's a real big fan of yours. Or your dad must be a real big fan of yours. Or your coaches must be. Or your kids just must really be. But through the years, I mean, for the last-- I know for the last four or five years anyway, that, uh-- and all, of course, my sisters, they of course they want you to do good and everything. And-- and even though-- I mean, even though you're my stepdad, and you know, you're my stepdad. And, you know, I've never been able to call, like, Mary-- you know, she's my stepmom-- I never have been able, really, to call her "Mom." -Well because I'm such a good mom you could never call anyone else "Mom." -But I've never been able to call, uh-- -I mean, I carried him for nine months. -I could never call her "Mom," but it was-- it wasn't any trouble for me, like, to call you "Dad." I think that you taught me more about what hard work will do for me than-- than my dad kind of did. He taught me the-- the skills. You taught me the, more or less, the conditioning. -Maybe I should get on the payroll. [laughing] -Yeah, please do. -Because I remember when we were little kids, you'd get outside-- get outside, pick up all the sticks in the yard, you know, and stuff. And discipline, Bruce or whatever, he thinks I get my character form-- from you. -Me? -Yeah. And I know I get my discipline, the way I run the kids-- the way I run those kids and the strictness that I do with them, it certainly didn't come from-- it didn't come from Dad. And it didn't come from Mary. That came from you. Because I know that when you said something-- -Oh, Henry, you mean. -Hell yes. When you said something, by God, when we were small, even now-- -You did it. -When you said something, boy, you went out and did it. -Those 12 little kids, how do you treat them? Would you treat them like you do your own kids, or--? -Hell yes. I-- I'm firm with them, real firm with them. If one of them needs to-- needs to get their ass kicked, I'll cuff them around and I'll-- -You're kidding, you do that? -I'll kick their ass. Hell yes. They're all from the street. They don't know no different. That's with they're used to. That's what they're-- that's what they listen to. And I know when I was a little kid, by God, when you told us to get out there and do something, if we didn't do it or we screwed up, we got our asses kicked for it. And I-- and I know that was more beneficial to me. I certainly never held any-- any kind of grudge, or never felt any-- anything bad towards you when you whipped our ass. Because I knew every time we-- we got our asses whipped-- -You had it coming. -We had it coming, and we had it coming full tilt. -I'm gonna kiss you. -I love you, Mom. -Love you. I mean, I'm hearing things I've never heard before! -Happy Father's Day, Dad. -Thank you, Andrew. -You bet. By God. -This is great. I love it. Man, you guys ought to all come to Portland all the time and straighten families out. [music playing] -Hope nobody from the gym sees this. [clears throat] OK. "For God's sakes, let us sit upon the ground and tell sad stories of the death of kings, how some have been deposed, some slain in war, some haunted by the-- some haunted by the ghosts they have deposed, some poisoned by their wives, some sleeping killed, all murdered. For within the hollow crown that rounds the mortal temples of a king keeps death his court. And there the antic sits, scoffing his state and grinning at his pomp, allowing him a breath, a little scene, to monarchize, be feared, and killed with looks, infusing him with self and vain conceit, as if this flesh which walls about our life were brass impregnable, and humored thus--" Whoops, wait a minute. "--and humored thus comes at the last with a little pin bores through his castle wall, and farewell king. "Cover your heads and mock not flesh and blood with solemn reverence. Throw away respect, tradition, form, and ceremonious duty, for you have but mistook me all this while. I live with bread like you, feel want, taste grief, need friends. Subjected thus, how can you say to me, I am a king?" -One, two, three! [music playing] [music playing] -Andrew, when's the first time you got laid? -Well, Morg, uh, ay ay ay. I was, um-- how old-- you're in eighth grade, right? -14. -You're 14 now? Well, you just turned 14, right? -Yeah, I was, uh, I was 13 years old. There's a little story behind it, Morgan. I'm going to go ahead and share it with you. All, uh-- all my friends and everything kept telling me, oh, they were-- they were getting laid this, and they were getting laid that. And they were all saying, oh, they were going down behind the creek and-- and doing it. And I'm going, Jesus. You know, and I figured I'd better-- I'd better get with it or I'm not gonna get [inaudible] by the time I was 30. So-- so me and my girlfriend, I'll leave her name out of it, we went-- we went down there. And I didn't even know what I was doing, really. But we went ahead and, uh, and got the good job done. And I came back up. And I was telling everybody, bragging to everybody. And they were all going, you did? Really? And I said, yeah. And they were all bullshitting. They told me, they said, oh, we never did. We were just kidding. So I-- you never had so many girlfriends after that. You know? That reminds-- oh boy, here we go-- that reminds me-- that reminds me of a joke. All right, this-- -Oh, please no. -Please. -Please! -These guys don't like my jokes. Hey, hey, hey. This guy-- this guy and his wife get in a fight at home. And he goes to a bar. He's sitting there drinking. He's sitting there with his buddy. And he's pissed at his wife. And his buddy-- they're sitting there, drinking and talking. Pretty soon his buddy asks him, he says, say, say, does your wife, does your wife close her eyes when you're fucking her? And he says, yeah, she'd do anything to keep from seeing me have a good time. [laughs] Look, these guys don't laugh. You guys don't appreciate good humor, you bums. How about you, Aaron? -Um, why are you usually a dick? Explain that to me. What do you mean, why am I usually a dick? -I mean, why are you usually a dick? -Like how? -Like-- -When have I been a dick to you? -Like, um-- -The way he acts, Aaron? -When? -Yeah, the way you act. -How do I act? -Like a dick. -Well, what's a dick act like, then? Then if you're going to call me a dick, I want to know why I'm being called one. -Well, a dick's an asshole, and-- like an asshole, then. -Well, like what? What have I done to you to make you call me an asshole? -Um, pinched my nose. -Why did I pinch your nose? -To pinch my nose. -Why, though? You're telling me I just pinched your nose for no reason at all? -Yeah. -You're lying. -I ain't lying. -Oh, plea-- you're lying. I never come directly up to some of this that's two-bit and take a swipe at you or pinch your nose or anything, unless there's a reason. -Uh-huh. -No I don't. -Yes you do. -How many of you guys have I came up directly to, just directly to, without you do anything to me, and took a swat at you or pinched your nose, give you a charley horse or anything? How many of? -You've hit me before. -Huh? -You've hit me. -How many of you? -Right here. -Yeah. [all agree] -OK, so I was lying. [laughs] Got to keep you guys in line somehow. Right? -No. -No. -So you're going to call me a dick just for that? None of these other guys call me a dick. -Dick. -Dick! -Dick. -To your face, anyways. -Asshole. -Yeah, you guys have a good time while you can, you little bastards. -I know you had a hard time where you stopped. What brought-- what helped you come back? And, you know, what made you want it? -My desire to win. I think still that my desire to win is by far and away greater than any boxer alive right now. I lost that last fight. By God, I couldn't go to sleep. I was-- I couldn't go to sleep at night. For three weeks I couldn't sleep at night. I got mono, strep throat, bronchitis, was sick as a dog, because I just don't like to lose. I trained hard for that fight. I knew I should've won it. I could've won it. And I didn't. And I-- you know, to me, my desire to win-- above it-- and in anything. It don't matter whether it's checkers or sandlot baseball or anything, man, I hate to lose. I just hate to lose. I can't see putting all the time and effort into something and not getting something out of it. I got world travel, and I got paid for it. I got status, notabil-- notoriety from everybody around me, pride from my family and friends. People looked up to me. And I think basically everybody-- I think that's kind of what everybody wants. Anybody, you know-- like this film crew, you know. They-- they're hoping that maybe this will be just something great, that they'll get some notoriety and some-- some greatness out of. And that's what-- the way I felt towards-- in boxing, you know? I-- I wanted all that. I saw guys on TV, and they're raising their hands up and they're-- and they're feeling great. -Guys you'd beat? -Yeah, especially guys that I had beat. That's what made me come back to boxing. That kid that won a national title after I had beat him twice as a junior kid and I had quit-- I saw him on TV, beating the East Germans, one of the toughest teams in the world. And I said, Jesus, to myself. Because I beat that guy twice as an amateur. I looked through my scrapbook, you know. And I've told you countless amounts of times, and I don't tell this to every kid that comes around-- that hey, I haven't ever said it to Chad or-- or to-- or to like Jerry or to, you know, any of them guys, that, hey, you've got the ability. I think you could be a national champion, especially a senior national champion. Juniors is fine. But seniors is they're all striving for. They want to win the junior nationals so it'll set them up for the senior nationals. Everybody wants to win the senior nationals so it'll set them up as a pro. -Yeah. -For you it's hard. I don't know what-- what you want to do. Do you want to-- do you want to-- do you want to fight pro eventually? -Yeah. -I mean, do you admire the way that my lifestyle is, basically? -Yeah, I do. -And I know you like cars. I like cars, too. I wouldn't be able to own these nice cars if I wouldn't have won when I was a little kid and trained hard and ran. I-- I bring it all back to boxing. I wouldn't have the things I've got now, you know, material things. But the material things are secondary, basically. The pride that my family feels in me when I come back from a fight that I've won, and-- and my boxing team and my friends when they look up to me and say, boy, you did a hell of a good job in there, you know, to me that's worth everything in the world. [music and cheering] -Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen. I would like to welcome you to the annual [inaudible]. -You're going to see some real fighting today. -Excellent. That's what we're waiting for. -You're going to see it. Our fighters are ready. [music and cheering] -Come on! -What are you gonna do out there, Two Bit? -Kick his ass. -How bad? -Bad. -This guy here is awful. All he's got to do is get one good shot in. -Now, no mercy in there. No mercy at all. -You guys, get a good picture of this guy right here. He's the guy to watch. He's going to be the new champion. -I don't want him thinking about nothing but winning, nothing but winning the fight. -What are you gonna do when you get him in trouble? -I'm gonna stay on, I'm gonna kick his ass. -What happens if you get him hurt? -Keep on going with it. -I don't want you just letting him go. Banish him. [cheering] [cheering] [music playing] -Andy, one of the reasons why we came out here to do this film on you was that ever since we first met you at the Colorado Sports Festival, everybody on part of my team, my friends, kids we'd worked with, do you know what they always said about you? -What? -They'd never forget you. -[laughs] Well, that's good. I'm glad that they'll never forget me. -Hey, look, like, if you bought this record to learn how to speak hip from a record man, that is the squarest thing I ever heard of. I mean, wow. But, look. So like you bought it, you must need it. So that was a smart move. You know what I mean or something? -[clears throat] Hello there, and welcome to the exciting world of hip. -Oh, just relax, baby. Me and this other cat, we're gonna straighten you out. -This is a new departure in language instruction. For English speaking people who want to talk to and be understood by jazz musicians, hipsters, beatniks, juvenile delinquents, and the criminal fringe-- -What time is it? I got to make a phone call. -Shh. Ladies and gentlemen, your instructor, Mr. Geets Romo. -Look, is it going to be a long session, man? Let's head out for some pizza or something, huh? -Mr. Geets Romo, your instructor, will pronounce a series of hip words and phrases. After each one there will be a pause so that you can repeat the phrase aloud. Mr. Romo. -Dig. Dig it. Dig yourself, baby. Dig the chick. Dig the cat. Dig the shades on the cat. -Greetings. -Hey, do you have any idea how boring this must be, what a drag? -Oh, please, Mr. Romo, just read your little list. -Oh, man. Phew. Hey, what's happening baby? What's shaking, man? Hey, there you go. Hey. -And farewells. -Hey, I'm gonna split. This is a drag. I'm gonna cut. You got eyes to split? Let's make it. You going uptown? I got wheels. Want to ride? My short's outside. Hey, we're going to get in the wind. Later.
