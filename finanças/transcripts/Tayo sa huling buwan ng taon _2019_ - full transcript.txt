If you see me orbiting around promises wasted all those years, hold me, feel me, pull me back, so I will not feel alone spinning around my own sun, as it beams light in the darkness. Remind me to look back at the moon and swim in the sea of the stars before leaving this moment of our gaze. Hoping in the thought of our breath in the beginning of the end, and the end of the beginning this longing will fade and our hellos shall soon again be said. Teachers! Just a reminder. Don't forget to put your test papers in your drawers. You know a lot of kids come in here. Just to be safe. Hey, Dagame! Didn't I just say to tidy up? I'll do it. Have lunch. You won't be able to have lunch later. Come on, everyone. Let's go. Let's eat. Sure. How are you feeling? Thanks for the sandwich. I'm okay. How's your day? And all the adjustments that might happen, inform the team at once so that we'll be ready, okay? How's the logistics? Sir, we're okay. The suppliers are ahead of time, and the tarps will come this week. -Sir, please sign... -Wait a minute. The graphics for the billboard aren't edited. You should have given me two weeks. Give it to me. Guys, this is Isa's last project. Okay, let's take a short break. Text me when you're done. Yes, I'm going home. - Hon. - Ma! How's the commute? It's okay. I was with Sir PJ. - Really? - Yeah. You? How's your fever? Better, compared to earlier. I brought your test papers. Really? Who substituted for me? Miss Honey. Finally did actual teaching. - I'll text her later. - Yes. Ma. Sam. Let's eat. Call your brother. Tell him we're having our dinner. Okay. - Pangkoy. - Hey. I still have a runny nose. How are you? Hi, Auntie. Good. You arrived with Dad. Hello, Uncle. - God bless you. - No kiss? Let's eat before the soup gets cold. There. Shrimp, to get rid of your sniffles. Get it? Shrimp, sniffles. Shrimp, sniffles. - This is how you eat shrimp. - How? You take off the head, then you bite the neck. -You all start eating, -Come here. Let's eat. I just have something to do outside. You haven't watched my short film. My professor said it's a revelation. It was perfect. I watched it. Why didn't you share or like it? I watched it. You should submit it to contests. - Really? - Yes. You didn't share or like it, either. What about me? I shared and liked it. I even commented. Why did you delete it? You didn't even like my post. - Ma... - There you go. Ma. He's embarrassed of you. Always trying to act cool. Kick him out of the house. Anna, try the chicken. Okay. I'll have the Wi-Fi disconnected. Your brother shows no love. He doesn't even reply to any of my comments on his Facebook posts. What? Ma, I'm just not affectionate online. But I love you. Come on. Of course I know that. You love me because I give you your allowance. Even without. You know that. Even though you don't have money to buy online game credits? Or costumes for your characters? Ma, it's called an avatar. Hey! You ask Ma money for that? You should be ashamed. Harsh. You're so hard on me, you don't even think about my feelings. Goodness. That's why your girlfriends leave you because of your attitude. Really? - This has coconut milk? - Yes. Marinated the meat with coconut milk, saut√©ed it with soy sauce and vinegar, then dried it. Have some more rice. - I made a lot, bring some with you. - Sure, Auntie. Get the water. Pour me some. Don't! Why? That stupid Wi-Fi. I will have it cut, watch me. Give me the water. Go, slave! Move! I can get it. Always treating me like a houseboy. - Treating like a houseboy? - Slave! Good evening, everybody. Let's eat. Baby Girl is here. So beautiful. You lost weight. I didn't. Come and eat. Shrimp stew. Looks good. It's sour. Of course. Delicious. Isa, have you started packing? Yes, but we still have a lot to do. Hey, slow down. - Eating like there's no tomorrow. - It's really delicious. So what? Slow down. I peeled this for you. How sweet. Peel some for me as well. Wait. Pa. Ma, it's not too sweet. It's okay. Just a taste. - Because your sugar is high. - Just a little. Just a little. Just a taste, okay? - It's a deal. - Did you get your father's medicine? But the CT scan will be ready next week. Isa, eat more. My stomach is already big. What? He's kicking. Sis, can you check? Hurry! There's a baby in Baby's tummy. Eat them all, okay? That's why your bag is so heavy. You brought all that. I'll work on them a little at a time, so it's easier on Monday. That's six sections. Plus yours. I'm sorry. Do you have an extra stapler so I can help you? Give me a set. There's one in the drawer. You're so sweet. So sweet. Of course, this is heavy. Bro! - Bro. - What do you want? Don't have sex yet, please. I need to ask you something. Idiot. Okay, come in. It's open. Can you check my DSLR? The shutter won't work. Have it checked in Hidalgo tomorrow. Exactly, bro. Can you go with me? I still need to go with you? Yeah, where will I... With that hair, you still need me? Well? - Well... - Actually, it's a good idea. Let's buy our presents at Hidalgo. It's on the way. - Please? - Please? Okay. Here, I'll give you money. Go to Hidalgo on your own. You can do it. Anna, let's play games later. Sure, but I don't have a mouse. I have a wireless one. - Wireless? - I have an extra for you. Bro... Get out. - I know what's on your mind. - Get out. Nothing. What a fool. You know, you're always enabling my brother. What's with you? It's not often he's affectionate. And when was the last time you bonded with him? See, you can't even answer. I'll be affectionate. The test papers. I'm being affectionate. Why? You're tired? So tired, poor baby. Poor baby. Poor baby. Smells good. Smells good. Ouch! You're such a pig! You timed it. You don't fart? No! It's not... You need to get used to it. Get used to it being a part of your life. I can't. You can't? You can't! You're so horny. - The kids' test papers. - They're fine. Fix them properly. I need to pick up stuff I left there. Sure, when? Okay, I'm available. Game. What's that? You're working too? No, just uploading photos. Fatty. Fatty. - Fatty. - And you? - Fatty. - Fatty. - Fatty. - You're so fat. - Don't call me fat. You're the fat one! - Fatty. - What's this? - Fatty. Why? That's my abs. - You're calling me fat? - That's my abs. What is it? That's so old. You wanna be suffocated? There. Don't breathe! Hey. Hey. Don't! Hey. Why are you two so noisy? Pangkoy, stop that. You look like an idiot. Ma'am, take my seat. Please. We should've taken a taxi. We'd be stuck in traffic. Here we can get down at Recto, then walk to Binondo. Put your bag in front. - I forgot to close it. - It's open. Oh, no, it's broken. - It's broken. - It's old. I'll buy you a new one. But that will be my gift. Okay. Fine with me. Who's that? Who are you listening to? Listen. Right? ESCOLTA STREET CITY OF MANILA - Stop it! It's been a year. - Hey, you guys! Whatever, smelly Pangkoy! Pangkoy, do you need to pee? There's a restroom there, maybe you need to use it? - Pangkoy, do you remember? - Don't pee there. Who was the one that suddenly cried then left the classroom broken hearted? - Not sure. - Who was it? I don't know. Who was that? I don't remember. Your first boyfriend. Ren-ren, right? Right? - Stop it! - It's a good thing it's okay with you. I don't know why I cried over him. - There was also Luke in college. - Isa, stop it! - It seems you collected them all... - How about you? - Stop it! - You were broken hearted before, right? Why? - Yes, but... - But? - Nice! - You know too much. Change subject. Why are we... Here are your flight details. There. We fast-tracked it at the agency. Because we're great like that. Thank you so much. Looks good? What's your plan in the US? What about you, Frank? Look for part-time work to help my aunt out. Wait a bit and maybe get a job with an airline. You chose December 31 to leave. It took a lot of effort to book that date. It's busy at the end of the month. They want me to report on January 2. Already? But at least when we arrive... How's your Master's degree application? It's okay. I mean... I submitted the application form and requirements. But I'm nervous for the entrance exam. You can do it. I'm worried about the schedule, so good luck to me. Here goes nothing. The summa cum laude is nervous. That's different. What about you? Why don't you continue your Master's? If I were you, continue it with me so we can help each other. I don't know. Comprehensive exam is all that's left. My residency application is unlimited there. I'm sure I have penalty courses. Why don't you continue? Comprehensive, thesis then you're done. Miss, we'll get seven of these. What's that? Pork mooncake. Your favorite, pig. I'm not ready. A lot of expenses at home, a lot of bills to pay. I need to make a little extra income. I hope by the time I start my Master's, you'll think about coming back. All you need is time management. That's easy. Guilty, I'm bad at time management. - You're the good one. - Yes, I am. Cum laude, summa cum laude, all the Latin honors. You miss shooting films? A little. Only a little? Why don't you try to write another script? You never know, you might get into a festival this time. Maybe next time. Not yet. I'll focus on school, then once Paolo has graduated, and his tuition fee has been paid, maybe. Maybe I can go back. - I'll get one for Miss Honey. - Sure. Shit, you scared me! Bro! You scared me! - Asshole. - Why? Because you never visit. Because I don't get haircuts. Exactly. Joke. Miss you. Thank me for I've missed you. - Hey, how are you? - I'm good. Yes, hopefully. Perfect. Cy is available. Nice. - The usual. - How are you? It's been a while. I know, stop being dramatic. Luke, where did you get this? Friends just wanted to display them at first. Then word got out, friends of friends, then local artists, some of them I don't know, they displayed their work. We do profit sharing, so win-win. Really? Why? Did you like something? I was thinking if I could display also? But maybe next time. Display what? - I don't know with her. - I mean... - Sure. - You... I was hoping to consign my zines. So... Then, we'll display them here. Sounds good? - Really? - Yeah, no problem. For you. I'll work on my portfolio. Thank you, Luke. Pangkoy, three boxes of rice cakes for your parents. - Thank you, Uncle. - Sure. Your favorite. - Wow, looks so good. - That's my child's favorite. Dad, did you buy me blanket? There, one for you and Pangkoy. - Can you call your father? - Yes, sir. For you. Dad, we have our tickets. Karen got it for us. Why don't you wait until after New Year? We have to settle into the apartment. Then the paperwork for my new job. Dad, Uncle Mark wants to talk. Bro! How are you? I brought your native chicken. - Kids, excuse me. - Sure. Yes, I have the... Nothing. Just a few more days. We can do this. I'm sure I'll find work when we're there. Sure as can be. Really? - Really? - Yes, sure. You're so cute, Pangkoy. Yes? For you. From my mom. She says Merry Christmas. That's a lot. - What? - Your tears will drop. I'm used to it. I always spend Christmas alone. - You're spending Christmas with us. - Yeah. It's nothing. I just miss them. Especially my dad, since I couldn't visit him at the hospital. Are you sure you want to sell your land? Yes. So Dad can come home. What? There you are again with your... What? I'm just looking at you. It's fun there. - My grandfather is so cute, promise. - Really? Pack a lot of stories. Okay, I'll prepare. I'll gossip everything you're doing here in Manila. Wow. Hon, what time does the bus leave tomorrow? Hon? Do you want to live with us instead? Don't be stupid. At least there, it isn't like your apartment. You're alone here and it's smoggy. My face will be the first thing you see when you wake. - Wow, really? Okay. - You don't like it? - Let me think about it. - Imagine. That's hot. We'll wake up together. Then, we cook breakfast. - We can. - No. - You'll cook me breakfast. - The audacity to make me a slave. Yes, but I'll make you coffee. Why? Your coffee isn't even good to be bragging about it. We'll go to school together. I know that move! You'll just make me an alarm clock. - I know you. - Exactly! Jerk! What about this? And this? Buy me some braised beef downstairs. Over there. And soft drinks. I know what you're thinking. What? You're thinking that our babies, one will look like you and one will look like me. And they'll have an American accent. That's crazy. You've lost it. Frank... No regrets, right? Thank you. Don't think about it anymore, please? Wait, where are we going? I just need to meet Philip at the model shop. I have other things there. By the way, are you free tomorrow? We have an activation at the Ayala Triangle light show. Maybe you want to come? I'm not sure. I have to bring Dad to his check-up. I'll pick you up after. But buy me ice cream first. Look at this. Beautiful. Don't upload that. I look ugly. It's pretty. Nothing's changed. What? This whole factory. Let's go see my grandfather. Weird, but I'll miss the heat and the dirt. - There you go again. - I won't miss this beauty. Don't. Just one. Oh, it's Philip. Hi, Philip. These are all you needed. And a little something for you. Business was good last month. You're the best. Thank you for this, Philip. If you need any illustrations, I can send them online. That can work. I haven't met anyone as good as you. You're better than me. So, all set? Most likely, we are. Send my greetings to Auntie. Take care of him, Isa. - If ever he pees, pack him some diapers. - Damn you. Noted, Philip. This place is beautiful. This is your first time here? - Come on, I'll show you around. - Sure. Have a seat, Anna and Sam. Eat a lot, grandfather. It's your favorite. Are you eating well? You might not be eating much. - Dig in. - Can't help it. How's your father? He's okay. He got the operation, but is still in the hospital. You think Mrs. Teng is here? - Auntie, papers for the house and land. - Sure, thanks. The day after tomorrow, I'm moving all your things from my house. Anna, start packing your room. Okay. Sam, eat. Give him some of this. - It's her favorite. - These two are so sweet. You know, Sam, we raised this girl well. When she was little, we knew she would be a teacher. - Really? - Yes. Well, all the children of the workers here, she would teach them after she got home from school. Did you know she's a top teacher at our school? Wow. You're lucky. You're so good, Anna. When her parents left, you never heard a complaint from her. Hopefully, Neil and Lorna can come home safe. I'll see you at the house. - Sure. - Are you leaving now? I'm still fixing something inside. - Okay, grandpa. Take care. - Sure. Anna, eat some more. - You had a long trip. - Sure, Auntie. You too, Sam. Get more rice. Philip. How much is this? Why are you whispering? For Frank. Don't worry about it. I'll have it wrapped for you. You know when you were kids, he always like to play astronaut, so it fits him. I can't. Are you sure? Maybe you want something? My Christmas gift to you. There is. Thank you. Come here. There. Here. What if I buy your house? With our salary, idiot? I'll sell my kidney. That's not enough. - Installment. - You wish. Come on. Let's live here. You're crazy but we could. Manila is very problematic. Everywhere you look problems. You think we can live in a place like this? We can work at the school nearby. Yes, we could. - Could we? - We could. You know what? I'll bring you to my secret spot. Wait. Ma'am, where to? Take me to the mansion. - What? Mansion, really? - Take me to the mansion. Let's go. You're coughing because it's so dusty here. You noticed? This is where I watched my mom hang our clothes to dry. It's peaceful here. I can hear myself more. Far from the noise of the factory. Where is the... Wait a sec. What are you doing? Tell me. Put it there. This is my spot. There. Have a seat. Sit down. What time is it? Is it almost 5:00 p.m.? Almost 4:00 p.m. I feel stupid. Why? - Why do you look amused? - I'm just asking why you feel stupid. I mean... Do you know I'm afraid of airplanes? - Why are you judging me? - Nothing. You started laughing before me. Because... When I was a kid and planes flew by, I felt like they would take me. What? Aren't those aliens? What did I know about UFOs back then? I didn't know anything. The last time I was here with my mom and dad. Then all of a sudden a plane went by. And then I was alone. I have a question. If I ask you to marry me, will you say yes? I think you should propose first before I answer. Seriously, I want to know. Maybe. I can't really hear you. Just message me when you get home. Take care. Sure. Bye. - Bro. - What? Your ID. Then, this is for you. - Okay. - Your camera. - Here. The lenses. - Sure. Until the end of the show. The pay is good. I trust you. I've been looking for you. Where did you go? Bro, let's go. I saw something. Okay, wait. Over here. Isa! Hi, Isa. How are you? Where do you work? - We're the... - We are in charge of the photography. Are you with them? Isa, we're taking photos for the Make It Makati project. Maybe we can take a photo of you and your friends. Nice. Okay. It's okay with your friends? It will only be used online. I can tag you, guys. Cool, thanks. Let's take it. Bro, I'll take the photo. You're good there. Just compress. One more. Last one? Nice. - Let me see. - Here. There. That's beautiful. - Are you okay with this? - Yeah. Tag me, please. Thank you. It's the anniversary of our barbershop. We have a small gig. - Okay, just let me know. - I'll message you the details. Nick, Tiara, you're invited too. - I'll go with you, Isa. - All right. Thank you. We'll get back to work. Let's go, bro. - Tiara, shall we? - Where to, sir? I'm hungry. Isabelle Locsin, what are you doing? Let's eat. Let's eat, bro. I'm starving. Sure, your treat. Of course, it's your treat. - You ass! - What? - Our shares are big. - You're too frugal. - And you're the one that invited. - What the... Cheapskate. Bro, look. It's Frank and Isa. Luke's barbershop is having its anniversary celebration. Yeah, he mentioned it. In Escolta? You going? See you! He's grown up. How's Frank? Epic. Why are you doing that? You don't need to. Why did you get them from my room? I'm not busy, son. Just watching TV. I saw them while cleaning your room, so I took them. Ma. Wait a minute. How was your trip? It was okay. From Anna's aunt, rice cakes. Really? Hey, Paolo. Get me two forks. Hurry. Why me? Now. Don't talk back. Go. - Okay, boss. - Get my slippers. Don't forget. Son, does your sister call you? Really, your sister. She sends us packages, but doesn't even check on us. Let me do this, Ma. Samuel, what do you think of me? When I was still working, I could staple 500 test papers in one sitting. I know, Ma. Can you teach me how to make a Facebook account? Facebook? Since you're leaving again, I can see when you online whenever you forget to call me. Dad... You have a good job here. It's a great opportunity. Okay, well, when you get to San Francisco, tell me how much your rent will be. I'll take care of it for now. Dad, no need. I have a feeling, you're not coming back. Don't forget to say goodbye to your mom. Visit her soon, okay? I will, Dad. Sir. Paolo? Miss, 10 and 28 are the same question. It was repeated. She's not coming back. Okay, if there's no more... Last day tomorrow. Vacation time! No more students! Hey, drink up! Here. Later, Karen. - Hon. - Hey. It's nice! Uh, secure this area for the party later. Thank you. You shouldn't have. Congratulations on the barber shop's anniversary. Thank you so much. Thank you. Hey! How are you? What are you wearing? New business, Walk-A-Booth. My girlfriend, Anna. Picture. Game! Should I join? Go. Okay, I'll join. Wait, I need Isa right now. - They just arrived. - I'm taking a picture. I need help because we have a lot of batchmates here. I don't know why Luke doesn't want to hire waiters. Luke, you didn't hire a waiter? Bobby was supposed to handle it. - Fine, we'll do it. - This is your revenge, huh. - Bro, how about this? - What? - Me and Frank. - Sure. For collage on the other side. We'll do this. Wait a second. Just like in college. There. Nice. Here, look. All right. Nice. You can keep it. Bro, wait. I'll look for Herald outside and pass this to him. It's getting heavy. Hon, wait here. I'll help you when I get back. Sure. But can you get me a beer? - Beer and fish balls. I'm hungry. - Okay. Sure, no problem. - So you can consign here? - Yes. I can refer you to my cousin, we can consign our airplane models. Airplane models? Sure. Anna has poetry zines on display. Hey! Last time we saw each other was thesis defense. - Do you remember that? - Was it? That's right, it's been a long time. I can't forget that. So long ago! Disgusting! Look, Anna has zines with her. Check it out. - This is it? - She prints it herself. It sells a lot. Just a sideline. Excuse me, sorry. I just need to check the setup. Enjoy! Your zine layout is nice. Actually, let me get two for me and Isa. Are you sure? Okay, here. Add another copy. What? Okay! I'm thinking we can collaborate. - Sure, we can. - In your next zine, if you like my pictures or illustrations, add them to your layout. Just thinking out loud. Before I became a pilot, I was a graphic artist. Okay, so you're a pilot? Not commercial planes, private planes. Okay. And you also make, what do you call them? - Scale models? - Yeah. Nice. Looks good. - Just side work for a little extra income. - Likewise. Is this all you do? No. Sam and I work at the same school. I'm a high school teacher. There. Thank you. You're welcome. This is just simple. A lot of people here. It makes me dizzy. I know. That's why I'm just at the side. But I'm also trying to make a little extra cash. Guys, here. Thank you. Anna's zine. This is so nice. Everything I wrote in college up to now, I compiled, then Sam also helps me. He pushed me. Nice, right? It's so nice. - Thank you. - Impressive. Guys, let's eat. What do you want? I'll just wait here. I'll wait here. You had fish balls cooked. Let's go, take a break. Okay. This is nice. - Let's eat. - There you go. That's still your favorite snack. - Who owns this? - That's mine. - Why didn't you put chili garlic? - I added. Stop, I'm so embarrassed. We don't need to... You know what, I told her to go all out with it. - You should, It's good. - No. I mean... I need this for my literature classes and I tell students to also write. - Come on. - What? Really? Dim sum, my treat. - Really? - Yeah, I already paid for it. Joke. Luke paid for it. Thank you, Sir Sam. Oh, was Frank your student? Yes. Photography class. He's good. And now he's a pilot. He told me earlier. Not yet, Sir Sam. Brother, I'm not your teacher anymore. Just Sam, okay? Let's go to the stage. Can I try some? I love this! This is my favorite. Me too! - You're a cheese person? - I am. You still have... You have cheese on your... - I got excited. - Just wipe it out. - That's my favorite. - Really? It's off now. You got it. Hey, bro. You know Joseph? Our groupmate in OJT? He's coming. No, I think I graduated already. I was in the US. That's right. - I always think that you're our batchmate. - No. So you're a higher batch than everyone else? Yeah, but one batch higher. Just one. You want? By the way, I heard the news. When are you guys leaving? New Year's eve. Guys, I'll just go to the restroom. More nachos? - I'm good. - You're good? Thank you, babe. What "babe"? You haven't gotten over me? Let's all move on. I'll wait for you until you're like 75. Stop it. You're disgusting. - Even to 100, I'll wait for you. - I'm dead by then. I want to thank all my friends that came out to celebrate. One year anniversary of Folk! Thank you! Let's rock and roll! - This is it! - This is it! Good evening, everyone. My name is Gabby Alipe. I hope you all sing with me. - You know this? - Of course I do. Strong. - Pao. - What? - Pao. - Hey. Where's Anna? She went to the market with Ma. Why? You miss her? You're so needy. Ouch! You want me to shoot your next vlog? I'll even light it. - What? - You're such a jerk. - There you go. - Shit. Why? I don't have a present for Anna. You're in trouble. Oh, wait. Just recycle a gift from your students. Just like that. It's all mind games. - Ouch! - Talking to you is worthless. Why are you such a jerk? You too? - Hey. Hello. - How are you? You? I know. What are you doing here? Looking for a gift for Anna. Last night? What about you? What are you doing? Just looking. I bought Frank a gift from the store over there. His is messed up already, held together by electrical tape. That's sad. It's true. Do you want a book? - What do you want? - What? I mean... - No need. - No, it's... My and Anna's gift for you. Maybe Frank wants something too? This one. FOR THE TEMPORARY ONES And this. Two? - You offered. - Yeah, sure. Do you want to eat? It's lunch time. - Sure. - Sure. So, why only now are you looking for Frank's gift? I already have a gift for him, excuse me. He really needs a new charger. He's just making his old one work. You? Why are you only buying Anna's gift now? No. I'm human too. I am. Wait, where's Frank? Why was he not with you? He was still sleeping when I left. How's Anna? Well, she's with my mom. Woke up early to go to the market. She's close with your mom? You and Frank are leaving, right? When I left for US, they were demolishing this, right? The staircase also. They took out a lot. Only the fa√ßade was left. Just suddenly disappeared. Isa? What? Do you have amnesia? That's all you have to say to me? Weren't you the one who said too? I messaged you. You didn't reply. Were you mad at me? Yes! I can't book a ride. Let's ride the train. You drank too much. Why don't you rest now? Go. You know what, I can book a car so you can go home... I'm bringing you home. I'm fine. Tell me what's your problem. I don't understand you anymore. My dad has cancer. What are you saying? You should just go home. Can you talk to me, please? Really? Go home, or do you want me to call Sam? You know, I was a sophomore in high school when I knew I loved you. Even though we always fought, I always rushed home to see you. You know where I went wrong? I went to America without thinking about you. That's why when I found out about you and Sam, I had no one to blame but myself. It hurts. I had no right to be hurt. It's my fault. I just told myself, I'll go home. I'll come back and fix all my mistakes. I'll put you first. I forgot about myself. I even forgot about my dreams. I couldn't admit it to myself. I thought maybe things would change. Maybe if we go to America, like you planned before, hoping that everything would be fixed. Do whatever you wanted so I could make it up to you. It's all my fault. But I was wrong. This is not what I want. I want to find myself first. You know how much I love you? I don't know if I'll meet someone like you again. Someone that will love me like you do. But... I'll leave it to fate. What's important is I make it up to myself. I just want to fulfill my dreams. Take care in America. And this is our poetry video entitled "Orbiting". If you see me orbiting around promises wasted all those years, hold me, feel me, pull me back, so I will not feel alone spinning around my own sun as it beams light in the darkness. Remind me to look back at the moon and swim in the sea of the stars before leaving this moment of our gaze. Hoping in the thought of our breath in the beginning of the end, and the end of the beginning this longing will fade and our hellos shall soon again be said. I promised myself that time and again, I will always hope to see you. And if time turns back, I will hold you. I will feel you. I will pull you too, so you can feel you're not alone spinning around the sun that I created to see light in the dark. US AT THE END OF THE YEAR
