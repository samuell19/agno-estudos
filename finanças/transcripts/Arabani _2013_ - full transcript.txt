Mom. make some coffee. -No. no need. Please. -Please. Sheik. - Please. Please. Sheik. Please. -Please. Please, Sammy. Please. Yosef. I've come with these respectable sheiks to find a solution for the trouble with the kids. The kids? The punks who take the law into their own hands. Oh no. what are you talking about? Patience, hear what the sheiks have to say first Please. Sheik. Please. Yosef, sir. you know there's a problem with your kids. the village is uneasy. Your son walks around smoking. and he stole ‘the state flag from the county building. Your daughter walks around with guys from the village in indecent clothes. You know it's not our way. Sheik. I know our way and easterns, and I try to respect our tradition. but let me ask you this, . since when is breaking windows and graffiti part of our way?. Oh no. we condemn all kind of violence. but God willing you'll understand what brought all this on. And why does my mother have to suffer? I didn't think you'd have an answer for me. I think we better go and talk to the Imam. Sheik Kamal. Sheik Abu All's door is always open, go whenever you want. But for your own good, leave the village by tomorrow night. because we can't be held responsible if anything happens. What's wrong. Yosef? Listen. Sammy, I'm not going to leave the village, especially not because of you. What do you mean? Why do you do that? I didn't come near you, I did nothing wrong. You better not. I lived like a dog. I ate shit I went through hell to make her forget about you and the past. until I made a decent person out of her. Are you crazy? Since when is she your property? Stay out of my relationship with my wife, get it? Stop it. Sammy. -Go back in! Go see your daughter walking around the village. Watch it! Don't talk about my daughter, understand? If anything happens to my kids or my mother's house, I'll burn you. got it? I'll burn you! Hello. -Good evening. Sheik. Hey there. -Is the Imam in? -Yes. come in. Please. -Thank you. Good evening. Sheik. -Good evening, my son. Please sit down. Oh no. you first. Thank you. I hope you're not mad at me. 'm not mad. just disappointed to hear you're accusing religious people of violence. I apologize. Sheik. I didn't mean to upset you. Will your Honor allow my mother to return to the temple9 Of course. Yosef. But first solve your problems. If your dear father were alive he wouldn't have let this happen. I understand your poor mother. You ruined her life when you married a Jewish woman, and you're ruining it again because of your pride. This is a small community with very clear rules and regulations. if we don't uphold them, everything will fall apart and you know that. Please. Sheik. Forgive me. my son. One more thing... Respect other people's privacy. Goodbye. -God be with you. "We'll burn you tonight" They sprayed the wall again. God help What are you going to do? I'm tired, mom. Tired. It's a shame your father didn't get to see you before he died. Did he speak about me? No. But he waited by the front door every day... waiting for you to return. Who are you? How do you two know each other? Uh... Uh... We met at... I don't like you two sitting outside together. Really? -Yeah. If you want to sit together, do it inside. Yeah? Let's beat the hell out of them. Quiet, sit down! Why? -No need to explode. Why don't we just call the police? e don't need the police. Thanks Nothing.
