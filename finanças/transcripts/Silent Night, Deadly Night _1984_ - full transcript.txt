The weather looks good for Santa Claus tonight with a full moon and a starry sky help him find his way. The temperature right now here in Bartlettsville, 21 degrees, brrrr! Well, let's listen to Christmas Fever. ♫ What a night of cheer this is ♫ How grand it is to feel so merry ♫ Life is very gay ♫ When people catch the Christmas fever ♫ How delightful on this sequence ♫ Saints and angels sing among us ♫ Holly hung just right ♫ And faces bright with Christmas fever ♫ What a night of cheer this is ♫ How grand it is to feel so merry ♫ Life is very gay - Mom, what time is it? It's almost 4:30, honey. We're gonna be at Grandpa's pretty soon. - Mom? - Yes, Billy. - What time does Santa Claus come? - Not until everyone is asleep in bed, hon. - Can't I stay up and see him? - I wouldn't if I were you. It's naughty to stay up past your bedtime. Santa Claus doesn't bring presents to naughty children. - What if we don't get home by my bedtime? - We will, hon, don't worry. Santa Claus is gonna bring you a big surprise tonight. You just wait and see. That was always one of my favorites. Give us a call at KSCZ for something special we haven't played for you yet. - I've had your father brought to the recreation room. Right this way. - Dad? Can you hear me? It's me, Dad, Jimmy. - Dad, it's Ellie. We have Billy here and little Ricky, too. - Why doesn't Grandpa say something? - He doesn't hear us, honey. He doesn't even know we're here. - Then what did we come for? - Billy. Shhh... - He's gotten so much worse. - I have your father's records, Mr. Chapman. We can review them in my office. - Wait right here, okay, honey? Daddy and I are gonna be right back. Don't worry, Grandpa's not going to hurt you. - Grandpa? Mom! - Shhh, quiet! What do you want her for? She can't help you. Nobody can! You scared, ain't ya? You should be. Christmas Eve is the scariest damn night of the year. I'd be scared too, if I was you. You know what happens on Christmas Eve, don't ya? You know all about Santa Claus? - He brings presents to all good boys and girls. Your daddy told you that, didn't he? Well, I'll tell you something, Santa Claus only brings presents to them that's been good all year. To the ones that ain't done nothing naughty. All the other ones, all the naughty ones, he punishes. What about you, boy? You been good all year? You see Santa Claus tonight you better run, boy. You better run for your life! - It's time to go home, Billy. Dad. We have to go now, we'll come back and see you soon. Come on, son. - I'll be good from now on, I promise! - Mommy, were you ever naughty when you were little? - Once or twice. - And did Santa Claus ever punish you? - Where did you get an idea like that, hon? - Grandpa. - Grandpa? - Grandpa said Santa Claus was gonna punish me. - You think Dad could've talked to him? - I don't see why Billy would lie. Maybe we oughta call Dr. Conway. - I don't want him to come, I'm scared! - Of who, honey? - Santa Claus! - Honey, there's nothing to be scared of! - Grandpa said Santa Claus was gonna punish me. - Billy, calm down. Grandpa is nothing but a crazy old fool. Mommy, you shouldn't have said that. It's naughty to say bad things about old people. Santa Claus will punish you. - Well, ho, ho, ho. I don't get enough of this shit on the radio, it has to come into my store now? - What's the matter, you don't like Santa Claus? - Eh, it's good for business, bad for my stomach. Lot of phony sentiment, you know what I'm saying? What charity are you with? What the hell you doin' that for? - I'm holding you up, asshole! Put the money in the bag. - All right, all right. So, it's not all phony sentiment, is it? A lot of it's genuine greed. All right, you! - $31 bucks! Merry fucking Christmas! Steve Carlson here at KLOX FM, where the temperature this Christmas Eve is still holding in there at 21 degrees at seven o'clock. Well, we hope Santa is dressed warm tonight, don't we? ♫ Santa's watching ♫ Santa's waiting ♫ Christmas Eve is slowly fading ♫ Can't you hear him in the night ♫ Close the door - How's it going, hon? - Got a ways to go yet. - What's that? - Hm? - I thought I saw something out there on the road. There it is again, see? - There's something up there, all right. - What would anybody be doing stuck out here in the middle of the...? Oh, hey! Do you see what I see? - He must be on his way to a party. Do you think we should wake up Billy? - Santa Claus! - Looks like you get to see him tonight, after all, Billy. - No, Daddy, I don't wanna see him! Keep going, don't stop! - Need a ride, Santa Claus? - Well, no, not exactly. - What's the problem? - Oh, there's no problem, it's just that I ran into a little bit of lousy luck. - Jim, go! Go! Go! Oh! Oh, no! - Never hit me! Ho, ho, ho! Where are you, you little bastard? ♫ Little baby ♫ Sweet little baby ♫ Pretty little baby ♫ Sweet little baby ♫ So so so so sweet ♫ Sweet little baby ♫ Pretty baby ♫ Oh ♫ Sweet little baby - All right, now who's next? Oh, yes. We haven't seen your drawing yet, have we? Billy. Billy! Answer me! - Okay. - Let's go, Billy. Come on up here. Put your drawing up on the board with others. You put it in place and I'll put the tape on it. - Sister, look! - Billy, take that down! Young man, you go find Mother Superior and you show her what you've done. March! - Explain this, William. - I'm sorry, Mother Superior. - Are you? I don't think so. But you will be. You will learn what it is to be sorry. Now go to your room and stay there. - Yes, Mother Superior. - Until I tell you to come out. - Well. You finally have what you've been asking for, Mother Superior. Proof. - Of what, Sister Margaret? - Of what I've been saying. - That it's all still inside him. All that terrible violence he saw. His drawing clearly shows that. - I am not interested in what you think. I thought you finally understood that. Simply because something unfortunate happened to his parents, which he knows nothing about, is no reason to allow him to run wild. He must be taught! - But the memory is still there, Mother Superior, waiting to come out. - And if it does, and if he has received proper training, he will know how to cope with it. - But if he keeps going on like this much longer, it may be too late! It seems to get worse for him every Christmas. - Well... It won't go on any longer. I will take charge of that child personally. - He needs help, Mother Superior. - He'll get it! Good day, Sister. - Good day, Mother Superior. I think you've been locked away up here long enough. Why don't you come out and help us build our snowman? - No, I can't. - Look, Billy. Mother Superior only wants what's best for you. And I think what's best for you is to come out and play with the other children, okay? - Yes. - Okay. - You filthy devil! You'll pay for this. Punishment. You devil, take your punishment. Devil! Take it! - I'm sorry! Please don't... Devil! Take it! William! - Don't blame him, Mother Superior, I told him he could come out. - Stay out of this, Sister Margaret! William, come here. - Billy, what's wrong? - Your brother's a nutcase, that's what's wrong. - No, he's not, take it back! - Boys! - What did you see upstairs, William? - Nothing, Mother Superior. - Do you know what they were doing? - No, Mother Superior. - Good. What they were doing was something very, very naughty. They thought they could do it without being caught. But when we do something naughty, we are always caught. And then we are punished. Punishment is absolute. Punishment is necessary. Punishment is good. - Yes, Mother Superior. - You left your room, William. - Yes, Mother Superior. - Very, very naughty. Now go to bed and stay there. - Ow. Please let me up. Sister Margaret! Let me out! - Leave him alone. - Please let me up. Please let me out! Sister Margaret. Let me out of here! Let me out! Let me out! Sister Margaret. Let me out of here! Please! Please let me out, Sister Margaret. - I see nothing but greed where there should be gratitude. Are you ready to behave properly, William? - Yes, Mother Superior. - Good, go find your present. We will have no more trouble with him. You will see how well my methods work. - Of course he'll improve once Christmas is over. He always does. - Well, it isn't over, Sister Margaret. We still have our annual Christmas visit from Santa Claus. William will sit on Santa Claus' lap and behave. You'll see. - No! No, no! No, no! No! No! Oh no! - Lily, out of the way. - No! No! - You will learn gratitude! Say thank you to Santa Claus. - No, no! No! - Billy! Billy! - What the hell is wrong with that kid? - I'm sorry. I didn't mean to be naughty. Don't punish me, please! - William! - Please, Mr. Sims. Every store in town has turned us down. There must be some job you can give this boy. Why, he just turned... - I'm sorry, Sister, but I only have one job open and it's for a man, not for a boy! It's in the stockroom hauling crates. It's just not a job for a kid. - I suppose not. - Sorry I couldn't help. - Well, you wouldn't expect some kid to haul heavy crates all day long, would you? - Glad you understand. Oh, here's Billy now, maybe you'd like to meet him, Mr. Sims? - That's not necessary. Billy! Billy, meet Mr. Sims. - Oh. Well, I'm always happy to help the church, Sister. He starts Monday morning. Nine o'clock sharp. - Oh, thank you, Mr. Sims! ♫ I'm looking for ♫ The warm side of the door ♫ Where the fire's bright ♫ And it's burning every night ♫ Everybody will be there ♫ And they'll be smiling at me ♫ And I won't need no more ♫ On the warm side of the door ♫ My brother's there ♫ My brother's there ♫ On the warm side of the door ♫ He'll call to me ♫ He'll call to me ♫ The way he did before ♫ There'll be thunder and lightning ♫ But we're safe and sound ♫ And I won't need no more ♫ On the warm side of the door ♫ Oh oh ♫ There's always people who love you ♫ That will kiss you and hug you ♫ And it's always Christmas ♫ On the warm side of the door ♫ There's always people who love you ♫ That will kiss you and hug you ♫ And it's always Christmas ♫ On the warm side of the door ♫ Hey hey yeah ♫ There's always people who love you ♫ They're gonna kiss you and hug you ♫ And it's always Christmas ♫ On the warm side of the door - Just what the fuck do you think you're doing now? - Um, you shouldn't, you shouldn't talk like that. - Oh, well excuse me, Ann Landers. You know, what is it with you lately, Billy? - Nothing. - You know, I'm gonna level with you. When you came here a couple of months ago, you were an all right kid. But all of a sudden, you've got this fuckin' attitude problem. Snapping at me all the time! You're staring off into space like some moon goon! - Will you just, just leave me alone, all right? - When I leave you alone, asshole, none of your fucking work gets done! - Look, I don't care about my fucking work. - Oh, is that so, wise ass? - Look, just leave me alone. - Merry Christmas, everyone! Ho, ho, ho, ho! Merry Christmas! Ho, ho, ho, ho, ho! - Come here, you little bastard! - Yeah, I'm alive. - Are you all right, Billy? - Y, Yeah. Yeah, I, uh... - You don't look so good. - No, I'm fine, really, I... - Don't worry about this stuff, I'll straighten it up for you, okay? Are you sure you're all right, Billy? - Yeah, yeah. I never felt better in my life. Billy, are you sure you're all right? Never felt better in my life. - No! I wanna be good. - I didn't mean to be naughty, I'm sorry. - Don't punish me. - Don't punish me, please! - Christmas Eve! Only one more day and this Christmas crap is history. - I hate to ruin your party mood, Mr. Sims, but a teensy problem has arisen personnel-wise. - Well, do something about it, solution-wise. - It ain't that simple, Mr. Sims. I just got a call from one of the employees, it seems he went ice skating last night and broke his ankle. He'll be out for the remainder of the season. - Lucky him! Call the temporary agency and get a replacement. Do I have to think everything around here? - Well, then, think of this, the agency's only got women. This job requires a person of the male persuasion. - Oh! - A big, fat, jolly one. You receiving me? - Oh, no! - Ho ho ho! - You pull another disappearing act like yesterday, Billy, and I'm gonna go straight to Sims. I don't think you realize this, but I'm giving you a break. That's a hell of a lot more than he'll do. Sims is nobody's friend. Remember that. Ah, Mr. Sims! - Billy boy! How are you? I've been meaning to come around and see how you're enjoying yourself. Well, everything okay? - Uh, yeah, yes, fine. Everything's fine, Mr. Sims. - Good, good, good boy. Listen, Bill, uh, the reason I dropped by, I've got a little problem maybe you could help me with. I mean, if you'd like to. - Of course, Mr. Sims. Anything you want, you just tell me what it is and I'll be glad to help out. - Good. Good boy, thank you. That's very good. Very realistic! Isn't it, Mrs. Randall? - He's definitely fat and jolly. - Take a closer look at yourself in the mirror, Billy. Just remember, be jolly. Lots of, uh, "Ho, ho, ho." And try not to scare the little bastards. Sometimes they cry their heads off. I guess they think the old guy's scary. Silly, isn't it? - Yeah. Silly. Hey, stop. Please stop it. What's the matter with you? Please, stop. Please, stop it. What's the matter with you? Stop it, stop kicking. Do you have any idea what are you doing? You're being naughty right on Santa's lap. I don't bring toys to naughty children. I punish them. Severely. That's right. Stop it. Or I'll have to punish you. - He sure knows how to handle kids. - He's great, isn't he? - Mommy! - I'm coming, I'm coming! Christ, keep your head on! Stockroom, Andy speaking! Who? No, no, Billy don't work back here no more. Sure, sure, I can tell you his new job. Ho, ho, ho! He's playing Santy Claus for a bunch of snot nosed kids. - Seven o'clock. It's over!

A boy should think about his parents at Christmas, good boy, good boy. - They're dead. - Oh, God! Oh, I'm sorry. I forgot, I'm sorry. Hey, Santa! Santa, you better sober up. You got a long night ahead of ya. - Huh? - You remember what Santa Claus does on Christmas Eve, dontcha? - Yeah. Yeah, I know what he does. - Better get started. Ow. Better get started. Fuckin' party's dead, anyway. Go get 'em, Santa! Go get 'em. - If you got me a present Andy, I don't see why you just don't bring it out there where everybody can see it.

Denise? - Can you believe this? It's Christmas Eve and we got orders to bring in Santa Claus! Hey, Miller, what do you think the captain would do if we brought in the real one? He's never satisfied! He'd send us back out to pick up the Easter Bunny. Or Peter Pan, maybe. - Hey, look. - What are you doing? What do you think you are doing? - Hold it! Stop right there! - Daddy! - Daddy? - Look at this hill! Virgin, man! The only kind you'll ever get! - I'm goin' down first. - Go on! What's the matter, you afraid? - Shut up a second. - Are you having a religious experience? Or did you pee your pants? - Somebody else is out there. - Who'd be out here this time of the night on Christmas Eve? Go on! - Be quiet for a minute! I feel like somebody's watching me. - Like who? Santa's little elves? - Well, maybe it was just my imagination. - Yeah, it would be if you had one. Now ride your stupid sled. - My sled ain't stupid. I'll show ya, watch. - Well, if it isn't Bob and Mac? Now why don't you guys just get the fuck out of the way? - Glad to, little man. But, uh, we're gonna go sledding. - Oh, that's the plan. - Yeah. - You guys are gonna take our sleds. Oh, you guys are great. You know, I wanna grow up to be just like you. Ugly and very stupid. - Do you wanna take that back, fuckface? - Drop dead! - I said take it back! - All right, all right, I'm sorry! - Now get outta here! Go on, get out of here! - All right, let's go. You go first. - Okay. Hey, what if I hit a tree? - Just go! - Ya-hoo! Yeah, woo! Woohoo! Okay, I'm right here, man! That's beautiful! All right! Now watch this! Wahoo! Woohoohoo! Woohoo, yeah! Woohoo! - Naughty! - Oh, God! Oh, my God! Oh, God! He's dead! Oh, my God! - Oh, Captain Richards! I'm sorry, I must have fallen asleep. Any news? - All bad, Sister. Three more murders. Been eluding my men all night. Kid may be nuts, but he's not stupid. - No, he's not stupid. In fact, everything he's been doing has a kind of logic to it, once you understand what he's gone through. - If that's true, there oughta be a way we can predict his next move. - Oh, my Lord! - I want those papers folded and stacked, not tossed about. And I want each one of you to write a nice thank you to Santa. For his visit later. Are you listening? - Better say goodbye now, Mother Superior wants us to write a note to Santa Claus. - That the only line out there, Sister? - I'm afraid so. Still busy. - I can't imagine who'd be on the phone so long. - We can't wait any longer. I'm going down to the dispatcher and you and I are going out to the orphanage together. Sister. I need every available car to go out to the orphanage on the double! Santa Claus killer may be headed that way now. Responding officers are ordered to shoot to kill, if necessary. - If you get wet or start to feel cold, come back inside. - Wow! Cut it out! Can't you see who's coming? - This is Officer Barnes. I'm approaching the orphanage now. Everything looks okay, there's a bunch of kids playing in the yard. Holy shit! Hey, hold it! Get outta there, get away from him! - Oh, my God! Children, inside! Hurry! Ricky! Come away from there! And the man dressed as Santa Claus was shot and killed at Saint Mary's Home. Ambulance is on the way. - I'm sorry, Sister. But at least it's all over. - Captain, we got a problem here. The description of the dead man, it's all wrong. - What do you mean all wrong? Well, Barnes says the guy's about 50, under six feet tall. - Oh, my God! It's Father O'Brien! He was our Santa this year. - The kid we're looking for is 18! Barnes warned the guy to stop, Captain, he didn't respond. - Of course not, he's deaf, he couldn't hear it! - You tell Barnes to stay at the orphanage. The killer may still be on his way there. 10-4. - We've got to help him. We've just got to! - I don't understand how you could have mistaken Father O'Brien for the murderer in the first place. He was dressed as a Santa Claus. - Captain Richards can explain everything when he gets here, ma'am. I'm sorry for what happened, but there is a killer on the way here. - Oh, the children. No harm must come to the children, do you understand? - That's why I'm here, Sister. - I am Mother Superior! And so far, all you have done is harm! - I'm sorry. I'm gonna check out the grounds. In the meantime, you make sure everyone stays locked up inside. Don't let anybody come in unless you know exactly who it is. - No one is going to get in that doesn't belong here! - Poor things are scared to death. _ Hm? Oh, yes! They need something to keep their mind off it. Richard! - Yes, Mother Superior? - Will you please get my pitch pipe? Such a good boy, not at all like his older brother William. Children, listen to me. I know that you're very upset and I understand, but I want you to stop that moping. We're gonna sing. Thank you. Ready, Sister? Deck the Halls.
