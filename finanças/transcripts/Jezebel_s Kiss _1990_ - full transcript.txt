[DRAMATIC MUSIC PLAYING] [SEAGULLS CAWING] [UPBEAT MUSIC PLAYING] [SEAGULLS CAWING] [DRAMATIC MUSIC PLAYING] [THUNDER RUMBLING] [MELLOW MUSIC PLAYING] I don't know why you never made it as an actress, but... I'm so glad you're back. Well, I figure if I was gonna... be waiting tables, I might as well do it in my own place. [CAMERA SHUTS] Hi, handsome. Don't bother stayin'. Goodbye. He should not drink. He can't handle it. [UPBEAT MUSIC PLAYING] How you doin', Babe? Oh. Gimme a beer. What's the matter, you forget the magic word? What I forgot was the hard time you always gave me. Gimme the damn beer, please. Oh. He said, "please." DAN: Think you'll get used to this place again? Who wants to get used to it? Well, everything's about to change. Oh, yeah. Faberson, Beach Renewal Project, yeah. Well, it's the same thing he said to me fifteen years ago. Makes me sick. I, uh... I don't wanna hear about it. Um... sweep up the front, would you, Margie? -No. -It's your place, too. -Come on. -Dad left the place to you, Virginia. It's because I can dance. Sweep up. Come on. Sweep up! Sweep up! I'm not a fucking child. [THUNDER RUMBLING] [SUSPENSEFUL MUSIC PLAYING] [TIRES SCREECHING] Oh, my God! Oh, God, baby, remember how it used to be? Sunday afternoons in the back room? You know, we had a helluva time. [CHUCKLES] Well, do you still wanna marry me? Like you did in high school? Figures. There's been an accident. -Where? -Uh, the Freeway Exit. Let's go. Well, I was a fool to come back. [INDISTINCT RADIO CHATTER] Christ, it's a woman. At least she's alive. If we gotta fix this, you better tell me now. I don't--I had nothin' to do with it, I swear I only found her. -I better call an ambulance. -No, no ambulance. No report, please. -I gotta tell your father. -No father. You really owe me this time, kid. [SUSPENSEFUL MUSIC PLAYING] [JAZZ MUSIC PLAYING] [BIRDS CHIRPING] [KNOCKS ON DOOR] Come in. SINGER: ♪ Wildflower from a Burning Sea...♪ Hi. I'm Margie. I'm... Jezebel. SINGER: ♪ There's a fire in her eyes♪ ♪ A hint of danger in her lies♪ ♪ Oh, Jezebel♪ You... wait right here. [DOOR SLAMS CLOSE] She almost fainted. I'm Doc Whatley. Jezebel. No last name? No middle initial either. Just follow this light with your eyes. And don't move your head. Those damn motorcycles. They're so dangerous. There are things that are more dangerous. How bad's my bike? Pretty bad according to the sheriff. Just thank God that you're not. It's gonna take money to fix. Any work around here? -Geez, Margie. -Come on, come on. -What, what, what? -Come on. What's that? Your problems are over. What? That covers a lot of territory. What do you mean? MARGIE: Just--you owe me. This is my sister Virginia. She'll let you wait tables. Um... early shift, yeah. It's slow at breakfast anyway so... DAN: Poof. Huh? Come on, Dan, guns make me nervous. Don't worry, baby. Poof. Lighting, huh? Grow up. You used to like watching my quick draw. I used to like Saturday morning cartoons. I used to be a virgin. I'm used to a lot of things. Things change. Slow down, partner, you're throwing me off. -Who me? -Yeah. She sure is a pretty little thing, huh? I hadn't noticed. You're full of shit. DAN: Hey. You never get fat smelling the bread when you pass a bakery, baby. It's only when you take a bite do you get fat? -Huh? -Uh-hmm. -Oh, this is your gun, huh? -Uh-hmm. [JAZZ MUSIC PLAYING] [KNOCKS ON DOOR] Come in. Mrs. Faberson, Ben Faberson, -and their son, Hunt. -Uh-hmm. Jezebel. BEN: Jezebel? You don't have a last name, Hon? It doesn't matter. Don't you want us to... notify your family? Don't have any. No one? I've been forced to take care of myself for a long time. Oh, you poor child. Please forgive me. I'm a little tired now. Oh, of course you are. We'll go now. Come along, Margie. Let her stay. Hunt? Hunt? Hope you get better soon. JEZEBEL: I wanted to thank you for the job. Thank my sister. And to tell you how much I like your paintings. That damned Coastal Commission drove me crazy. I don't understand, Dad, you're the mayor. Coastal Commission supersedes all local government rulings. Crazy bunch of environmentalists with power like that. Fifteen years is a long time. I really do admire your patience, Benjamin. Great dreams require great patience. I thought you were gonna start when I left for college. Well, the last five years were the worst. That damn Coastal Commission would lose my file. I'd reissue all the documents then they'd lose my application. Then they'd lose the files again. Hmm, it took me a long time to get to someone. Well, maybe this really is a better time for your project. After all, timing is everything. Couldn't be more perfect. God's perfect timing. You still don't think that God has a hand in this, Ben? This thing is freezing my hands. You had more. Aah. This is a regular pajama party. How'd you remember those? Oh. When you-- your friends would come over, stay up all night giggling about boys. Call them, hang up when they answered, giggle some more. Geez, how do you remember that stuff? Because I would've given anything to be part of it. Any boys you wanna hang up on now? Hmm? Uh... uh, George? Jez--Jezebel? Jez--uh, pull up--pull up a chair. Grab--get a glass, have a--have a Margarita and then--and then sit down. Okay. So what are you guys up to? We're having a pajama party. Yeah. I've never been to a pajama party. You? You must have had every invitation in the world. Invitations? I've had those since I hit my first foster home at eight. And when I ran away and hit the streets, I got even more invitations. What happened to your parents? Dead. My grandpa tried to raise me, but he died, too. VIRGINIA: I'm sorry. MARGIE: She's terrible. JEZEBEL: Those were the happiest years of my life. I really loved him... before the invitations started. Thanks for coming. -Come back. -WOMAN: Thank you. Is there anything that you want? -More coffee? -No. I saved those receipts for you guys. There's a couple of extras, okay? Thank you. Can I help you? Oh, yeah. Hey, darling, why don't you and me... Please. Please. Hey, I wanna do things to you that I can't even pronounce. I've got work to do. Leave the little lady alone. This bitch is mine. You can have the gimp. [INDISTINCT CHATTER] WOMAN: Stop it! Stop it! [INDISTINCT CHATTER] -Stop it! -[INDISTINCT] The party's over. Now, which one of you boys is gonna pay for this mess? You're too late, Dan! Geez! Look, I'm sorry this happened. Were you scared? A little. It's okay. If you ever need help again, or anything, you don't hesitate to ask, okay? All right. Good. [DRAMATIC MUSIC PLAYING] HUNT: Hi. I just thought I'd have some breakfast. Not today. Why? I came especially-- There was a fight. Oh, are you okay? Yeah. But I have to help with this mess. Hey, it's okay. We'll take care of it. Thanks. I could show you the house and my lab. Watch the little--oh, did that hurt you? I hope it didn't. Oh, it's so beautiful. Oh, look. Hunt's here. Oh. How lovely. Flowers and fun. Hmm. Hunt? Oh, what a-- what a lovely surprise. Hmm. Oh, my dear, you're looking much better. Thank you. This is Brady. She's been with our family, oh, since before Hunt was born. She's part Comanche. Never says much. She's not very good with strangers. You stay for lunch. HUNT: Oh, what a good idea. Uh-hmm. I think I'm going to show Jezebel my lab. All right. Snails? Mollusks. These are the same snails that be served in the finest restaurants in Paris. They look like garden snails. [CHUCKLES] Well, that's it, you see, when the Italian vintners set up the vineyards out here they brought the snails with them to feed on the grape leaves. Why would they wanna do that? Sunlight. The fewer leaves, the more sunlight gets to the grapes. I'm developing a hybrid snail that will eat twice as many leaves, more quickly. All this knowledge... and you can't even practice your profession. I can see my vineyard clearly. My father says it should be coming soon. I can imagine my dream and create it a hundred times. Can I kiss you? Hold me. AMANDA: Hunt? Jezebel? Luncheon is served. I'm so happy that you could join us. [WAVES SPLASHING] [SEAGULLS CAWING] I'd like to talk to you. You would? I ran a check on your Harley. I just wanna be left alone. Excuse us, Hunt. We're gonna find out who you are. I'm nobody. I just wanna do what I have to do here and leave. What exactly is that? Fix my bike and go. Have I done something illegal? Have dinner with me. -Is that like a proposition? -Sort of. You come out with me tonight... and I'll drop my investigation. No more prodding, no more poking. You promise? You can trust me, I'm the police. I'm not sure. I'll be here at six. Check. JEZEBEL: And checkmate. No one in this town has ever beaten me. JEZEBEL: Not enough competition for you... or your paintings. [DRAMATIC MUSIC PLAYING] My paintings... allow me to... go from one inventive world to another. I'm not sure if that's shareable with anyone else. I like them. I learned a long time ago not to work on deceiving myself. JEZEBEL: But you should cross open ground someday... at least to try. I'll think about it. [DRAMATIC MUSIC PLAYING] Anything wrong? DAN: No. You look great. [JAZZ MUSIC PLAYING] You know, I, um... couldn't sleep last night. I just lay there thinking of you. I slept like a log. The sound of the waves relaxes me. DAN: You like me, I could tell. You think so, Sheriff? DAN: I'm usually right about these things. WAITER: Here you go. [SUSPENSEFUL MUSIC PLAYING] Beautiful night. Strange crosswinds around here. DAN: The view out there is incredible. [SUSPENSEFUL MUSIC PLAYING] [INDISTINCT CHATTER] Can we go now? You're going to love it. [SUSPENSEFUL MUSIC PLAYING] You're not gonna let me go, are you? [INDISTINCT CHATTER] No. JEZEBEL: Stop? What are you gonna do, call the cops? If you force me now... it'll never happen again. Oh, baby. Smells good. -It feels powerful. -Yeah. Be careful, that thing is loaded. Is it dangerous? Very. Good. Because if it wasn't dangerous, it wouldn't be fun. And you don't wanna be a cop killer. Let me put that away for now. [SUSPENSEFUL MUSIC PLAYING] [GROANS] No. No. No. [SCREAMS] [MOANING] [GROANS] [MOANS] [SCREAMS] [DRAMATIC MUSIC PLAYING] [HUMMING] Oh. [SIGHS] Hi, baby. I wanna talk to you. Come here. Come on. Hmm. Oh. Oh, son, what's the matter? -Huh? -HUNT: Nothing. Huh? Do you know... when you were a little boy and I thought that you weren't... telling the truth. Hmm? I thought you were lying. I'd say... "Look me in the eye." You tell your mama the truth... hmm? Uh-hmm. It's Jezebel. [RAIN PATTERING] Stop that! -What's wrong? -Don't you get any sleep? What? Are you afraid I'm might lose out on my beauty sleep? Don't make fun of yourself. It's just... that you startled me. What happened to you? [DRAMATIC MUSIC PLAYING] Nothing. Sometimes it's not so easy for me, either. [SUSPENSEFUL MUSIC PLAYING] You really want her? More than anything. Until it hurts. Oh. You said that... about your first two-wheeler. And you got it for me. Hmm. Yes, I did. There. There now. Mama make it all better. Mama... make it all better. -Hello. -BEN: Good morning, Jezebel. -Have you decided? -BEN: Uh-hmm. Well, you have a powerful champion. My wife here... after yesterday's little incident, she tells me that this is not a good environment for your cure. It's okay. I have to make money to fix my bike. We'd like you to come and stay with us. You'll perhaps do a few light duties. We will pay you whatever you're making here. MAN: Hey, sweetheart. How about some more coffee? -I'll get it. -Oh, Jezebel, -this is no place for you dear. -BEN: No. -We'd take good care of you. -Thanks. You're all so very kind. Good morning, Jez. [DRAMATIC MUSIC PLAYING] [CAR ENGINE REVVING] What is it, dear? Are you sure you wanna go through with this? After all, you hardly know the girl. Oh, well now, Ben, she's had a bad accident. -Hmm. -And who is more capable of helping, hmm? -I've got work to do. -Of course, you do. -Don't you worry. -Nice to see you, Jezebel. -Hunt. -JEZEBEL: Hi. I fixed up... the guest cottage for you. I hope you like it. [DRAMATIC MUSIC PLAYING] AMANDA: What do you think? JEZEBEL: It's lovely. AMANDA: Thank you. JEZEBEL: I don't know what to say. AMANDA: Well, I studied interior design. Never had much of a chance to use it on the house. This cottage is a special project. The sea has always had a calming effect on me. I hope that it will help you, too. [DRAMATIC MUSIC PLAYING] She outgrew you already. No. No. [SCREAMING] Jezebel isn't here. How do you know I didn't come to see you? You know, Dan, women are a lot smarter than men. That's how I can always see through your bullshit. Give me a damn beer. [DRAMATIC MUSIC PLAYING] -What can I do to help? -No, no, no. Not tonight, Jezebel. Tonight you're our guest. Got one of those for me? Get it yourself. It sure is quiet around here. Doesn't seem like a real pajama party without Jezebel. [DRAMATIC MUSIC PLAYING] [KNOCKS ON DOOR] DAN: I got to talk to you. There's nothing to talk about. Come on, babe, I got to see you. -Open this damn thing. -For what? [GRUNTS] DAN: Jez, please. [DRAMATIC MUSIC PLAYING] AMANDA: Hi. What are you doing? Hmm? Just looking at the moon. Yeah. I wanna go to bed. I'll be right there. [DRAMATIC MUSIC PLAYING] [KNOCKS ON DOOR] HUNT: It's me, Hunt. What do you want? HUNT: Please, I have to see you. JEZEBEL: It's late. I saw you turn Riley away. JEZEBEL: I told you... I hate him. Please. Hunt, you're gonna get us both into trouble. I don't care. I love you. You got to have patience. Hold on. [DRAMATIC MUSIC PLAYING] If you insist... but it'll never happen again. [DRAMATIC MUSIC PLAYING] You smell incredible. What perfume is that? I'm not wearing any. [DRAMATIC MUSIC PLAYING] [GASPING] Oh, my God. [DRAMATIC MUSIC PLAYING] [BIRDS CHIRPING] Hi. There's something I wanna show you. JEZEBEL: I have to finish these windows first. They can wait. [BIRDS CHIRPING] What do you think? -What is it? -The new revitalized Faberson Beach Resort and an amusement area, complete with shopping mall, multiplex theatres, condominiums. There's even a carousel. This really looks impressive. But I think I like it as it is. Small, charming, quaint. BEN: You have to make the highest and best use of the land. But I think that's what exists now. It's so beautiful up here. BEN: I don't think you understand, Jezebel. I--I've been working on this thing for 15 years. JEZEBEL: That's a long time. I know. Well, part of it was because there was someone that held the key piece of property to the beach front. They wouldn't sell. No amount of money. We offered him five times its value. JEZEBEL: Did he finally sell to you? Oh, yeah, sure. Well, sort of. Actually, he died. But I lost six precious years in probing, even more battling the Coastal Commission. But now... Now the town will be renewed. Hunt's gonna drive you for your test, huh? Can't you take me? I really like to hear about your project and your other plans. All right, sure. If you're interested I'd like that, yeah. I got to see the Planning Commission anyhow. I'll get ready. NURSE: Does that hurt? No. NURSE: Good. Now, don't be nervous. I'm just gonna plug in the machine and ask you a few questions, okay? [MACHINE WHIRRING] NURSE: They left out the last name. I don't use one. NURSE: Like Madonna? Or Prince? Well, we need it to bill your insurance. The bill's already been paid. CROWD: Sell, sell, sell... Come on, please, please. Sell out, man. Come on, sell it. Sell it. CROWD: Sell, sell, sell... [DRAMATIC MUSIC PLAYING] What's wrong? Nothing. Nothing. I--just nervous, I guess. NURSE: Your history says that you were unconscious for several hours. That's true. NURSE: What's the last thing you remember? A pair of headlights bearing down on me out of the fog. BEN: Well, that's okay. Just give him the papers. Yeah, okay. Listen, I gotta go. Yeah. I'll call you later. Bye-bye. How long before we get the results? In about 10 minutes. Good morning. Where is everyone? Well, your father took Jezebel to get her tests. But I thought I was gonna take her, to make a day of it. Well, you should wake up earlier, dear. I've always told you that. Hmm? Now... What do you want for breakfast? Nothing. I don't want anything. There, there, there. Well, young lady, your brain scan shows you're perfectly normal. At least, there's no physical damage. BEN: Thank God for that. I think this calls for a little celebration. -I'm starving. -You're hungry? I think I know just the place. It's a long time since I had champagne in the afternoon. Thanks. [CHUCKLES] Thanks. Why do you do that? BEN: Why do I do what? Cover your mouth when you laugh? Like that? BEN: Do I do that? Yes. When I was a boy I had a badly chipped tooth. And we didn't have any money for a cap, or a replacement. I remember I felt so ashamed. So ever since then whenever I smile or laugh, I cover my mouth. I think that's cute. Cute? Me? Your teeth are beautiful now. Thank you. Here's to new memories for you. To the kindest man I've ever known. [FOOTSTEPS] WOMAN: May I help you? Wanna choose something? Pick anything you want. I'll try the skirt in the window. And maybe this top. [FOOTSTEPS] [HUMMING] [DOOR SQUEAKS] Hi. -Oh, hi hon. -Hi. Oh, what's all of this? Well, you said the girl needed new clothes. Of course, she does. How are the test results? She's just perfect. Oh, Ben have you been drinking? Hmm. We did have a glass of wine at lunch. Put a little color in your cheeks, didn't it? I'm gonna put away these packages. Okay. -Good night. -Good night. Good night Jezebel. [DOOR SQUEAKS] [DRAMATIC MUSIC PLAYING] [BLOWING] Round and round-- oh, you didn't tell me how things went at the Planning Commission today. Oh, more of the same from those assholes. [DRAMATIC MUSIC PLAYING] [GASPS] [DRAMATIC MUSIC PLAYING] JEZEBEL: What are you doing here? Well, I came by to do something I never do and that's apologize. Get out of here or I'll scream. -DAN: Oh, come on, Jez. -[SCREAMS] No. What the hell is that? Ben. Ben? [MOANING] BEN: Jesus, back off, Riley, back off. Take it easy, Ben. It's not what you think. Perverted bastard. Just get off my property. You got an hour to get out of town. -[CRIES] -BEN: Come here. Come on, Ben, you're kidding? You're finished, Riley. After all these years, you don't do this. [GASPING] You boys get out of here. This is a woman's job. I'll take care of her. The Sheriff's left. Oh, Jezebel. You're gonna be just fine. Hmm. Good morning. Hi. I got up especially early. Oh? How else could I be sure and see you? Well, you accomplished your goal. Can I see you tonight? I'm sorry, Hunt. You should've picked patience. Jezebel, you can't mean what you said. I mean... what happened between us. Uh, I told you, Hunt. It's over. Now, leave me alone. [DRAMATIC MUSIC PLAYING] [PANTING] [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] Thank you. Thanks. Um... this is the culmination of a dream that's taken over fifteen years, uh, and it's our heartfelt desire that Faberson Beach, and its residents flourish in progress and prosperity. God willing. Thank you. You got the scissors, Hunt? Thank you. Okay, here we go. You got a picture of that? [CHUCKLES] BEN: Dig a little dirt here. I've been looking for you. Couldn't you just throw up? Let's get away from here. Come help me fix my bike. Okay. And then chess. Maybe. Here, Hunt, you have a go. Don't you worry, dear. She'll be at the Albatross with Margie. Shovel. [HUMMING] AMANDA: Virginia, where's Jezebel? I don't know. Well, just sit and wait. Whatcha' doing? Uh, well, I'm, um, I'm trying to develop, a way to read the future from the bottom of a martini glass. Kinda like tea leaves, you know? BEN: What do you predict? VIRGINIA: Oh, on this auspicious day, um, the day you're going to make your dream come true. Well... I predict lots of money, money, money. [CHUCKLES] Money for us all. It's not only my dream, it's everyone's dream. The whole town's in on it. That's right, Ben. We're all in on it. All of it. I thought you were leaving town, Sheriff. Well, Mr. Faberson, sir, you thought wrong. To my way of thinking, we're sort of partners, all of us. BEN: You're crazy or drunk. Or both. In fact, when that old man died, we became related by blood. That was an accident. Well, ma'am, there's many degrees of accidents. And even more degrees of murder. Wait a minute. That old man died of a heart attack. DAN: Maybe he wasn't quite dead yet. Somebody finished him off in the ambulance. If we exhume the body, who knows what a Court of Inquiry would find. -HUNT: What old man? -Shh, Hunt! So you see Ben, I'm not going anywhere. I've waited a long time for this and I ain't gonna be cheated. What's wrong? AMANDA: Look at you. I was working on my bike. Yes, of course you were. Maybe we should all just go home. Okay. Goodnight, Virginia. I'm gonna go down to my lab. Good night. Congratulations. Good night, son. Thanks. Good night. No one said a word to me on the way home. Did I do something wrong? No, no, no. Of course not. Sometimes when you realize a dream it falls short of your expectations. -Good night. -Good night. [WIND HOWLING] JEZEBEL: Go away, Hunt. I told you to leave me alone. It's me Ben. Are you all right? I think so. Can I come in? Thank you. I couldn't sleep. I was thinking about you. I wanted to talk to you. Beautiful night, huh? The moon hitting the rocks. Yeah. [DRAMATIC MUSIC PLAYING] CROWD: Sell, sell, sell... Sell this [INDISTINCT] huh? -Come on. -No. -Sell. -No. [DRAMATIC MUSIC PLAYING] -Wait. -BEN: Come on. Sell this. Come on, Pa. Come on. Don't budge. You'll love this. Close your eyes real tight. [DRAMATIC MUSIC PLAYING] [CHUCKLES] Don't move. Relax. [DRAMATIC MUSIC PLAYING] [DRAMATIC MUSIC PLAYING] [FIRE CRACKLING] [DRAMATIC MUSIC PLAYING] [FIRE CRACKLING] I'm gonna change my life. We're gonna travel, gonna see the world. [DRAMATIC MUSIC PLAYING] [JAZZ MUSIC PLAYING] Amanda? Brady? What the hell's gone wrong here? [FOOTSTEPS APPROACHING] Oh, hi, hon. I want her out of here, Ben. I want her out of here, now. What you talkin' about, honey? Oh, excuse us, Brady, would you give us a minute, please? Thank you. Brady, stay here. She'll do whatever I tell her to do, okay? Brady is my jurisdiction. Well, as long as I pay the bills, hon- Don't say it. You have the gall to say that to me? After I stood by you through it all. You have had your little fun, now get rid of her, Ben. What the hell are you drivin' at? AMANDA: I saw you, Ben. I watched you go to the cottage... and I saw you leave. -I-- -It's her... or me. Her or me, Ben. I'm sorry, Amanda. Don't... touch me. Things sure are different since you came. I've got to get on with my life. Create something new. It's so easy for you. Easy? Can't you see? We're the same. Yeah. We're like two Siamese twins. [BIRDS CHIRPING] Morning. [GRUNTS] -Stop! -BEN: Amanda, stop it, stop it, stop it! My God, what's come over you? Leave her alone! Are you all right? Go away. I just wanna be left alone. HUNT: [CRYING] Oh, father. For Christ's sakes, he just couldn't leave her alone. He had to ruin it for me. He had to... JEZEBEL: Thanks a lot. What the hell happened to Hunt? Well, from what I gather... his daddy's fuckin' his girlfriend. Jezebel? You're kiddin'. Ask him yourself. [SUSPENSEFUL MUSIC PLAYING] Hey, have you seen my father today? Jezebel? [DRAMATIC MUSIC PLAYING] BRADY: Ready to go? [DRAMATIC MUSIC PLAYING] [CAR ENGINE STARTS] BEN: Amanda! Amanda, stop! Stop! Come back! Come back! Damn it. The bulldozers are finally moving. VIRGINIA: It's no good, Doc. I came back to this town to get rich, you know? I don't even care anymore. Success has no conscience, Virginia. We killed that old man. Is success worth living with that? I operated scrupulously within the laws of my profession. I had nothing to do with it. VIRGINIA: What did you put on the death certificate, huh? Natural causes? He was an old man and he had a heart attack. It was that simple. VIRGINIA: He was fine 'til we went out there and fucked with him. These things have a way of coming back at you, you know? [SOBBING] [SUSPENSEFUL MUSIC PLAYING] -Hi, Bill. -Hmm. Now, where are they gonna put that retaining wall? Yeah. So it comes around here through? -BILL: Okay. -Okay. [SUSPENSEFUL MUSIC PLAYING] Hunt. We need to talk. HUNT: Why? We never have before. Ever since I was a kid, you've been content to order me around. You reduced me to feeling like nothing until I finally hated myself. You destroyed every dream I ever had. But this is the last time. She was probably the one thing in the world that I really wanted. What have you got to offer her? Jezebel sees you as a successor, wealthy. But you sleep in my house, you eat my food. You live off the trust fund that I created for you. God. You've always been a disappointment to me. Why shouldn't she go after the real thing? HUNT: [SOBS] You sabotaged me when I was just a kid, you never gave me what I really needed. You don't have enough money to keep me in line. I'm gonna--I'm gonna kill you and set myself free once and for all. You've never had the courage to do anything, and I know you don't have the guts to kill your own father. [SUSPENSEFUL MUSIC PLAYING] [GUN COCKS] Fuck you! Freedom! -No! -[GUNSHOT] [SUSPENSEFUL MUSIC PLAYING] DAN: Ben? Give me the gun, Ben. Ben? Ben, wait! [CAR ENGINE STARTS] [SUSPENSEFUL MUSIC PLAYING] [CAR APPROACHES] [CAR DOOR OPENS] -AMANDA: Wait! -Stay back, ma'am. AMANDA: Wait. It's Hunt. Babe. It's Hunt. My Hunt. Oh, no! [SOBBING] -Who did this? -Oh, my baby. Oh, God, help me! -Oh, God. -Hunt and Ben had a fight. Hunt pulled a gun. They struggled, it... looks like your husband shot him. JEZEBEL: Why the long face? 'Cause you're leaving. I can't stay. It's over for me here. What will you do? Where will you go? Maybe I'll go back to my old job. What's that? I was a clerk... at the Coastal Commission. You were the only friend I ever had. He shot himself. He shot himself, hon, I didn't mean for it to happen. Please. Please forgive me. Please. [SOBBING] [SUSPENSEFUL MUSIC PLAYING] DAN: Ben? Come on out, Ben. [SUSPENSEFUL MUSIC PLAYING] DAN: Ben? You up there? Come on out, Ben. BEN: Hold it right there, Dan. Come on, Ben, you and I have to talk. BEN: Dan, put your gun up and come on in. Look, Ben, I know it was an accident. Just come on downtown and answer a couple questions and it's over. [SUSPENSEFUL MUSIC PLAYING] You know, Dan... these cards have a certain beauty. The colors, the order. I can see why they use them to tell the future. DAN: That's not what we need to talk about, Ben. No, I know. I want what's mine, Ben. You promised it to me 15 years ago. And I want it in writing. Sign this power of attorney. [SUSPENSEFUL MUSIC PLAYING] I'll burn in hell before I sign this. [SUSPENSEFUL MUSIC PLAYING] That's exactly what you're gonna do. [GUNSHOT] [SUSPENSEFUL MUSIC PLAYING] It was you. I should kill you right here. Go ahead... if that's what you want. Goodbye, Sheriff. [SUSPENSEFUL MUSIC PLAYING] Jez! I'm sorry, baby, but you got to die. [DAN GROANS] [SUSPENSEFUL MUSIC PLAYING] MARGIE: Wait! Wait for me. You don't wanna come with me. You said we were the same. Just a couple of Siamese twins. [MOTORCYCLE ENGINE STARTS] [MOTORCYCLE ENGINE REVVING] BRADY: She's gone. [DRAMATIC MUSIC PLAYING] BRADY: Things will get back to normal now.
