(whimsical music) - [Emily] My name is Emily Bradley. I have a friend called Masha. She got separated from her mother and came to my backyard. (whimsical music) We played together. We played together. I taught Masha how to wave goodbye. (whimsical music) We made a mess of the kitchen, but we made delicious cookies. (whimsical music) The go-kart track had never been visited by a baby bear. We had a great time. (whimsical music) I knew I couldn't keep Masha. My parents said she needed to be a real bear and live in the forest with other bears, and the thing is, my sister says the forest is being cut down, so I don't know what will happen to the bears. I think about them a lot. (whimsical music) (bear snorting) (dramatic music) (whistle blowing) (whimsical music) - [Boy] Go home, bear! Off you go, bear, come on now! (whistle blowing) (whimsical music) (Paw Patrol cheering) - Let's go. - Here they come! (suspenseful music) - [Officer] You're under arrest. - Daniel, throw me the tape! - Give me that! - I wish it were just done. (telephone ringing) - [Secretary] Greg, I have Melissa on line one. - Greg Bradley's office. - Emily, it's me. Put Dad on the phone. - I'm sorry, Mr. Bradley's in a meeting right now. - Emily, I'm serious. Look, I just got arrested. - Cool, a real breaking story. I want an exclusive interview for my newsletter. - Don't fool around, Emily. I've gotta get Dad to post bail. - Who have you told? The tabloids would probably offer a lot of money, but if you give me an exclusive on this, I'll try and protect the integrity of the story. - Put Dad on the phone now! - Hey, Dad, Melissa's been arrested again! (telephone ringing) How much we in for, Dad? - One thousand dollars. - That's it, only one thousand? Shouldn't it be more like 50,000? - Your sister didn't exactly rob a bank. - No, but that probably would've been safer. - Bail set at one thousand dollars. Dad willing to bail out one daughter, and won't allow the other to stay home alone. - Are you okay? - [Melissa] Mm hmm. - Are you sure? - Yeah, thanks. - You can thank me, but you know you're gonna be paying back every penny. - [Melissa] Mm hmm. (dog barking) - I know the bears are becoming a nuisance at the dump, but aren't the conservation officers suppose to protect them? - Mom, in this province, conservation means conserving money, not wildlife, because it's cheaper just to kill a bear than relocate it. - [Sara] Mm hmm. - And if Dad had any guts, he would write an article about how the logging companies are the reason why the bears are going hungry. - What about Masha? Don't you care if she gets shot looking for food? - We all care about Masha, but my column's not gonna stop a logging giant like Great Pacific, especially when jobs are at stake. - Emily, how's your newsletter coming? - I wanna do a story on Masha. - Let's not change the subject, okay? Aren't you concerned about this, Sara? - Well, yeah, of course I'm concerned, but I just think it'd be better if we discussed it when everybody's heads are a little cooler, hmm? - [Emily] Anyway, as I was saying-- - Emily. - Before I was so rudely interrupted. - Emily. - I wanna do a story on Masha, and call it Interview With a Bear. - Well, I think that's a very clever idea. Don't you agree? - Yes. - Sorry (chuckles). - I think it would be a good idea if Emily came to our peaceful demonstration. - Oh, by all means. That's a great idea. Maybe we can get two daughters in jail, huh? Then we can all go on the talk show circuit. - No, Dad, this is gonna be a lot more fun. - Cool, I'm going. - No, no, you are too young to be demonstrating. - Dad, you think I'm too young for everything. - Hey, aren't you the guy that always said that people are supposed to stand up for what they believe in? I mean, you are the guy I married, right? (chuckles) Come on. - Will you go with her? - I will. - Why does somebody always have to go with me? - Because. - [Demonstrators] No more clearcutting! When do we want it, now! What do we want? No more clearcutting! When do we want it, now! What do we want? No more clearcutting! - Save Masha's home! Save Masha's home! - Emily! - [Demonstrators] What do we want? No more clearcutting! When do we want it, now! - Save Masha's home! Save Masha's home! Save Masha's home! Hi, hi. - Seeing a little bear like you reminds me of an old native legend. It tells of a lost boy who turned into a white bear. - Cool. - Most kids today would never believe a story like that. - I'd believe it. You can tell me. - Another day. - [Demonstrators] What do we want? No more clearcutting! - Who's Masha? - She's a lost bear cub. I found her in my backyard. - Hey, Greg, come here, come here, come here. - Does she live in the forest now? - Yes, but her habitat's been threatened by logging. - [Sara] The girls are on TV, come on, come on. - And I'm very worried about her. - Environmental groups claim that logging activities in B.C. rainforests are destroying wildlife habitats. Many indigenous people revere the bear as their guardian, and now fear its extinction. Several disgruntled bears also joined the protest. - [Disgruntled Bears] Save our bears! Save our bears! Save our bears! - Save Masha's home! Save Masha's home! Save Masha's home! - Yes, yes, that's terrific. You should be really proud yourself, huh? - The protest had little effect on the forest protection board, which pre-approved Great Pacific's permit to continue logging in the Great Bear Rainforest after company president, Robinson, promised environmentally safe methods would be used. - I can not believe that they gave this guy a permit. - Rest assured that Great Pacific is taking every possible measure to balance business with environment. - I wonder you'd feel if they let people destroy your home? - What about environmentalists claims that your company's practices are in violation with the forest protection code? - Well, environmentalists love to fabricate stories. I mean uh, if there were no environmental disasters, they'd be out of business, wouldn't they? - Yeah, but we're in business, buddy. - [TV Reporter] Demonstrators are in front of Great Pacific's downtown offices with lighted candles. They have vowed to stay the night. - Daniel, we can't let this sleaze get away with it. We have to go to the rainforest. - Yes! - We get them on tape messing up. If the news airs it, then Robinson's gonna have to eat his words. The government can't ignore his violations. - (sighs) Eh, I don't know, Melissa. I got two exams to study for. - So, so do I. You're starting to sound like my father. - Melissa, I care about this as much as you do. It's just, does it have to be tomorrow? I mean, it doesn't even give us any time to plan. - Daniel, you can't take months of planning for every action. You gotta be spontaneous, seize the moment. Anyways, I'm talking about you and me going. It'll give us a chance to spend some time together. - I wanna go! - Emily, get out! Don't you know how to knock? (whimsical music) - Promise you'll take me? - Emily, you're too young to go. - I thought you were on my side. (mysterious music) (tree thuds) (Emily gasps) (car door thuds) (whimsical music) Excuse me, you were at the protest, right? - Yes, and you're the little bear. What brings you up here? - I'm going to the Great Pacific logging camps. - You don't say. Who are you going with? - My sister, Melissa, from the Paw Patrol. I was wondering if you could tell me how to get there? - It's not that far from here, but I know a quicker way to the camp. You can't take your bike though. - That's okay, I'll walk it up. What's the shortcut? - Where's your sister? I should discuss this with her. - She's at the camp already. - You mean you're all alone up here? Do your parents know? - Um, yeah, it's okay. You see, I've got this map to show me where to meet Melissa. - How we doing? - Okay. I think you should pull up here, park here. - Right up here? - Yeah. (dramatic music) - This place is so beautiful. - In my grandfather's day. People aren't respectable of power of the land. Even Raven, the trickster of our legends, has trouble making mischief. What's your name, little bear? - Emily, what's yours? - John. - Don't you have a real name? - Spath Shxwell. - Cool. (bear snorting) Can you tell me the story now? - There was a young boy. His father died while they were hunting in the woods. The boy became lost. He went into a cave and fell asleep. When the blanket moved, he realized it wasn't a blanket at all. It was a white bear. The bear was lonely. She offered to be the boy's mother and protect him, and so the boy lived with the bear. As the boy got older, the more he thought he'd changed, until one day he realized he was completely covered with white fur, and had sharp claws and a long pointed nose. (bear snorting) Now, we have to travel on foot. (whimsical music) - I think we're almost there, let's go. (whimsical music) - They cut right down to the water. Didn't leave a streamside buffer. - Yeah, this is it, we got him. Get it on tape. (suspenseful music) Ready? - [Daniel] Yeah. - This is evidence of mass erosion. Cutting right down to the waterline without leaving a streamside buffer as specified in the forest protection code. Get a closeup on all this. (suspenseful music) (thunderous explosion) Did you feel that? - [Daniel] They're blasting up there. - [Melissa] Let's get it on tape! (suspenseful music) - No trespassing? Who's this sign for, squirrels? People don't come out here. - It's for groups like your sister's who come up here to protest. Thing is that this is First Nation's land. The loggers are the trespassers. - [Norris] All right, Pete, I'm ready over here! Move it out, we're ready to go, let's go, come on! No taking breaks, all right! - Blasting. - [Norris] Gotcha, stand by! - This area hasn't been approved for road construction. - Illegal road building? - [Norris] Fire in the hole! - They are making this way too easy. (thunderous explosion) - [Norris] Beautiful, all right! (whimsical music) - Where exactly are you supposed to meet your sister? - Uh, right around here. (whimsical music) I'll look for her through this. (whimsical music) - Oh, my gosh. There's a bear down there. Get it on tape. - There's a bear! (whimsical music) - I hope that bear has the good sense not to stay long. (whimsical music) - This is great. (bear grunting) (whimsical music) - Yeah, we clear that out we should be right on schedule. - Yeah, where are the rifles? - [Scott] In the truck. (suspenseful music) - [Norris] John. - [Scott] Hand me some shells. - All right, just follow me, come on, come on. - [Daniel] Do you see what I see? - What do they think they're doing? That bear isn't even posing a threat. (suspenseful music) - If we get them shooting this bear on tape, they're sunk. This thing will air on national news. - [Emily] Wait for me. I'll be right back. - Emily! - All right, all right. - What're you saying? We can't just stand by and let them kill an innocent bear. - You're kidding, Melissa. It's too late to save the bear. We'd never get down there in time. - Well look, we've gotta do something. - On three, boys, one, two. (whistle blowing) - [Daniel] It's your little sister. - (gasps) Oh, God, move! - What's a little girl doing here? Hold your fire. (whistle blowing) - All right, boys, ah, cover me. Don't shoot till I get it outta there, and then you can blast it. (whistle blowing) (bear whimpering) Get, get back, get back. (Emily grunts) - Are you crazy? That bear could've killed you. - [Emily] It was Masha! - It wasn't Masha, Emily. There are hundreds of bears in these woods. You've gotta be careful. - Turn that thing off or I'll break it over your head. - They look like greenies. So, what do you think you're filming with that, buddy? - Nothing, just uh, the beauty of the woods. Just home movie kind of stuff. - We were just hiking and uh, Emily got lost. - No I, no I didn't. - Anyways, um, we weren't doing anything wrong, sir. - You get going. Do you know your way back? - Yep. - All right, back to work, let's go. (suspenseful music) - You've got a lot of explaining to do, Emily. How did you even get up here? - John showed me the way. - John, who's John? (thunderous explosion) We can't stay here, Emily, let's go. - But I didn't say goodbye. - Emily, let's go! (thunderous explosion) (Emily screams) - Emily! - [Emily] Melissa! (suspenseful music) - Emily! (suspenseful music) - Greg, Sara's on line three. - I'm late for court. I'll call her after. - Sorry, Sara. He had to rush out to go to cover a court case. - And Emily's not with him? - No, she hasn't been here today. - Well look, you gotta tell Greg. She's not at the aquatic center, and she's not at school, so I uh. Look, I'm gonna check home one more time, and then I guess I gotta go to the police. - [Melissa] Hey! - What do you think they want now? - A hot shower. - We need a boat! - A boat? - There was a landslide. Her sister fell in the rapids and got taken downriver. - Seriously? - Yes, she could be drowning, please. - Tom, call the RCMP. Tell them we need search and rescue right away. Show us where. - No, that's gonna take too long. You've gotta get me a boat. - We can't let you take a company boat into those waters. - My sister is in those waters because of your company. Because you guys violated the forest protection code! I need a boat! - Home movies, huh? Well, let me tell you something. Your sister's in those waters because your trespassing on land that you have no business being on. Now, if you take us to where it happened, we'll try to find her. - Come on, I'll take you in a boat. - Scott, the river's too high. - Scott, the river's too high. Don't be an idiot. You can't take that down those rapids. - Put this on. - Let people with experience handle this. - Relax, Norris, I can handle this. - I don't like this, all right. This guy, this guy's a cowboy. Maybe we should wait for the pros. - Daniel, show search and rescue where to go. You stay here, and call my parents. - Here, take this. - Thanks. (suspenseful music) - [Scott] Hang on! - [Melissa] I'm trying! - [Scott] Wait for it! (suspenseful music) - [Melissa] This water's quick! - [Scott] Just hold on! (suspenseful music) - [Melissa] Watch out! - [Scott] Almost there! (suspenseful music) - [Melissa] Look out! - [Scott] Coming around! (suspenseful music) Hang on! (suspenseful music) - Scott, come in. Scott, do you read me? (telephone ringing) - Hello? - Uh, hi, hi, Mrs. Bradley, it's Daniel. - Oh, hi, Daniel. - Uh, there's uh, there's been an accident. - What accident? - Well uh, there was a landslide. Emily fell into the river, and the current took her downstream. Uh, we don't, we don't know where she is. (Emily grunting) (mysterious music) - She's missing? - Yeah. - Emily! - Where'd the boat go? - It's downriver. - Listen, I think we should head back. - Well, you're free to go. - Listen, there should be a search and rescue party organized by now. I mean, we lost the boat, we lost our radio. If we stay out here any longer, we run the risk of spending the night, and that's not gonna help anybody. - Look, how far could she be? She might be just around the bend. (suspenseful music) (cougar growling) (Emily cries) (suspenseful music) - I have to reach him. It's an emergency. Send a messenger into the courtroom, and tell him I'm going up there, and if he can't reach me, then tell him to call the police, okay? Good, thanks, thanks. - Emily! Emily! - Hey, wait! - Emily, Emily! (Melissa grunts) - You can't run around like that in here. You wanna walk off a cliff and kill yourself? (Melissa grunts) What's the matter, you hurt? - Yeah, I think I hurt my ankle. Oh, where could she be? - Just because we found her shoe, it doesn't mean that she's here. She could be anywhere. Come on, let's go back and look for help, huh. (Melissa grunts) Come on, come on. (suspenseful music) - [TV Reporter] Once again, controversy plagues Great Pacific's logging operations. Earlier today, young people protesting in the Great Bear Rainforest met with tragedy. - 11 year old Emily Bradley fell into a river and was swept downstream. Search and rescue workers are racing against the clock as darkness and an approaching storm move in. - [TV Reporter] We'll have updates for you as they come in. (police radio chatter) - Excuse me. - Hi, I'm Sergeant McKinsey, the search commander. - I'm Sara Bradley. I'm Melissa and Emily's mother. Is there any news? - All three youths are still missing, but with current visibility the way it is, I'm afraid we have to suspend the search till morning. - What're you talking about? You're not gonna leave them out there all night. - Well, it's impossible in the dark, and we've got a storm coming. - You've gotta do something! You're not gonna leave them out there all night! - I understand, ma'am, but the best thing for you to do right now is to get some rest. Now, there's a lodge just down the road. - No. - We will be back out here at the crack of dawn. - I. (thunder crashing) (suspenseful music) (coyotes howling) (Emily gasps) (thunder crashing) (suspenseful music) (Emily grunts) (thunder crashing) (drum beating) (man chanting) (mysterious music) (bear grunting) (Emily sneezes) (bear grunting) (whimsical music) - Masha? (birds chirping) - Emily, Emily! Emily, can you hear me? - I'm freezing. I can't believe we spent the night out here. - Come on, I thought you were suppose to be the great outdoor man, mister lumberjack, let's go. Get your circulation moving, come on. - Oh gee, you're nice and warm. - You're body heat is gone, because you slept on the cold ground. (plane engine roaring) - That's the rescue plane. - Great, a lot of good it's gonna do. They can't even see us. - They're searching the river, come on. We've gotta get down there, come on. - Well, why don't we wait? I mean, those planes can't see us. Emily's in the woods. That means that they can't see her either. - All right, look, we have no food. All right, we don't know where we are, and you can barely walk. Those guys up there, they're pros, all right. They're find your sister, but right now we've gotta get spotted. Watch your step. - Ow (grunts). (Masha grunting) - No one's ever gonna believe this. They all kept saying there are hundreds of bears up there. That I'd never run into you, but I knew I would. I knew I'd see you again. Oh, is this breakfast? (Masha grunting) Gross, sorry, Masha, that's worse than sushi. (whimsical music) It looks like the closest town is south of the river. If we go there, I can call my parents. (Masha grunting) (whimsical music) Do you know which way is south? No, of course not, you're a bear. You probably don't even know what I'm saying to you. Oh, I have an idea. (whimsical music) My sister taught me this trick she learned at environmental camp. (plane engine roaring) - [Pilot] Second part completed. Return to segment five. The sweep over Kauai is over. - Roger that, estimated 10% POD in that grid. - Sir, what's POD? - Probability of detection. Every time we repeat a sweep, probability of spotting someone increases. That's assuming the person stays put and doesn't travel. (helicopter humming) - Good morning, Mr. Robinson. I'm Sergeant McKinsey, on-site search commander. - Yeah, hi Sergeant. Look uh, where are the girls parents? - They're right over here. - [Sara] Who is that? - That's Robinson. - Mr. And Mrs. Bradley, I'm Ken Robinson, Great Pacific. - What brings you up here, the threat of a lawsuit, or the threat of bad publicity in my paper? - My son, Scott, the one that tried to help your girls, - My son, Scott, the one that tried to help your girls, now he's gone missing too. - It's great out here. No one telling what we can and can't do. Red goes south. That means south is straight towards that mountain. Let's go forward home, Masha. - Greg, bring my baby back. (helicopter humming) - [Ken] Let's go! (helicopter humming) (whimsical music) (Masha grunting) - Berries, I love berries! Now you're talking, Masha. (whimsical music) Come on, Masha. We're never gonna make it to the village if you try and eat every last berry. I want some real food, like a big, fat, juicy hamburger. (Masha grunting) What is it? (Masha grunting) It's a black bear. Is it anyone you know? (suspenseful music) (black bear grunting) (Masha grunting) - Look at that, huh. You can never find a rescue plane when you need one. - Uh, yeah. - What is that? Looks like something out of a dinosaur movie. - It's a bear. Looks like it was killed by trophy hunters. - Well, how do you know that? - Well, there's no skull. This is what they do. Their heads wind up in some bar or office, and it makes me sick. You know, if Robinson didn't build these roads up to the rainforest, these hunters would have no way of getting at the animals. - You can't blame this on Robinson. I mean, it's not like he's advertising in Hunter's Weekly or anything. (Melissa grunts) (plane engine roaring) - Right now, I wish you'd cut down all the trees, so we could see where the hell the kids are. - Wait 10 years. This whole area will be harvested by then. (Masha grunts) (whimsical music) - You say harvested like it's some kind of seasonal crop you can plant every year. Some of those trees are over a thousand years old. - Now we see where your daughter gets her views from. - My views don't include protesting. There's no point. You know why? People like you will never change. - Feel free to speak your mind, Greg. - Don't mind if I do. You ready for the question, Ken? - Shoot. - Do you honestly believe that it's worth exploiting all these resources? I mean, you and I both know the involvement of our children, our grandchildren, our great-grandchildren. Well, they'll pay a heavy price. - That is such a pessimistic point of view, Greg. The fact is nobody knows what will matter in the future. - We've reached the edge of the forest. I'm turning around. (whimsical music) (Masha grunting) - Well, I'm glad it got away. (Masha grunting) I know what this is. Hunters use these to hide in. Masha, come here. You have to remember what this is, Masha. Stay away from these. Masha, this is serious. These things hide hunters. As in men who shoot bears. Like this, bam. (Masha grunting) (suspenseful music) (Melissa grunting) - [Scott] Careful now. (suspenseful music) - Scott, this is stupid. We're never gonna get outta this place before dark. I'll just wait here and you can go and get help. - Don't be ridiculous. - I mean it, I'm sick of this. - You're crazy if you think I'm just gonna leave you here. Come on, I'll carry you. - No, just because you're a lumberjack doesn't mean you have to act like Tarzan. - I'm just trying to help. You've gotta be the most stubborn person I've ever met. Listen, if I leave you here, and I go back, and have to send search and rescue looking for you, that's one less chopper looking for your sister. Besides, I haven't got your number yet. Come on, we can do this. - Okay. - Be careful, give me your hand, let's go. (helicopter humming) - We're running low on fuel. We should head in. - So, you never did tell me what your boyfriend was filming with that video camera. - Ah, what makes you think that he's my boyfriend? - Oh, I don't know, just a guess. - Hmm, well, we were filming uh, souvenir shots of you lumberjacks. - Souvenir shots, yeah, right, and by the way, I am not a lumberjack. - Hmm, could've fooled me. - What I mean is I'm a student just like you. I took a year off to get some real world experience. (plane engine roaring) You hear that? (plane engine roaring) - [Melissa] Hear what? (plane engine roaring) - That. (whimsical music) - [Pilot] We got them. Visual contact made with two youths at the river. Get the chopper over here. We'll give them the coordinates. (whimsical music) - [Melissa] Over here, hey, over here! (whimsical music) Dad! (whimsical music) Dad, I was so scared! (whimsical music) - [Greg] I love you. - [Melissa] I know. (whimsical music) - Are you all right? - Yeah, yeah, I'm fine. Melissa, this is my dad, Ken Robinson. (dramatic music) (helicopter humming) (suspenseful music) - Last chance for hot showers and cable, Vladimir. - What do you mean last chance? - Tomorrow we'll be sleeping in bear country. (suspenseful music) - I haven't seen a single snake so far which is fine by me. Oh, but there are millions of bugs out here, and they're eating me alive. They must think I'm walking cheese stick or something. Today I found out that Masha's not a vegetarian. Seems she likes cute, little squirrels. Lucky for me, she doesn't eat little girls. (insect buzzing) Goodnight, Masha. (Masha grunting) - [Waitress] Are you sure I can't get you anything, ma'am? - No, I'm fine. - You're not gonna eat? - I'm happy just watching you eat. Any news? - No, no, nothing. Well, they're expecting more bad weather. (Daniel clears throat) - Welcome back to civilization. - Hey. - [Daniel] Hey. I missed you. - Did you bring the tape? - Well, I uh, I guess I got some bad news. - When I got the camera back and checked it, the tape was gone. - [Melissa] What? - Somebody must've swiped it at the logging camp. That's the only other explanation. - [Melissa] Hmm. - [Daniel] Yeah. - Robinson had someone steal it. - What're you talking about? - We made a video tape of Great Pacific's violations. They obviously stole it. - Your sister is still God knows where in that rainforest, and you're worried about some video? I told you, Melissa, not to involve her in this stuff. - This isn't my fault. How was I suppose to know that she was gonna follow me up there? - Greg, listen to me. Emily, Emily's a very special little girl. She sets her mind on something, she just goes for it. You know that. She's stubborn and tenacious and willful just like you. It's not your fault. It's not anybody's fault. - I'm sorry, sweetheart. (birds chirping) (Masha snorting) - What're you doing, Masha? Don't tell me, another gourmet breakfast. My sister's not gonna believe any of this. Here Masha, talk into this. It's a recorder pen. This way I have proof. Like this. ♪ Do you like to dance from your head to your feet ♪ ♪ Do you like to dance in the hot summer heat, hey, hey, hey ♪ ♪ Do you like to dance from your head to your feet ♪ ♪ Do you like to dance in the hot summer heat ♪ (Masha grunting) Masha, talk into this. (Masha grunting) You know, Masha, we should take this blind apart. Come on, Masha, come help me. (whimsical music) Yeah, good job, Masha. - Ever go for a bear in Russia? - No, I drink only vodka. - I said bear, Vladimir, not beer. - [Vladimir] Ah. So, what's the plan? - We're gonna take a logging road up to Kauai Mountain, and hike in for a bear. I've got a blind hidden up there. I get a bear with it every time. (speaking in foreign language) - [Hunting Guide] What? - Good. (whimsical music) - There's the town, Masha! Oh, I can't wait to call my parents. They better have pizza in the town! (whimsical music) I don't think anyone's lived here for a very long time. (crow cawing) Now, we're really lost. (crow cawing) (plane engine roaring) You hear that? There's a plane! Please, please, please let them see me. (plane engine roaring) I'm here, down here! (Masha grunting) (Emily crying) (mysterious music) A mountain, that's where we have to climb for them to see us. - And we fully covered the area around the river, so we have to assume she's in the woods, so we'll extend the search grids further into the forest. - And what is this right here? - That's an ancient ruin, that's nothing. - Couldn't we just extend this circle to include it? - Yeah, it's spreading ourselves a little thin for an area she's not likely to go in. This is Kauai Mountain. It's very rugged territory. There's no way she could possibly go up there alone. (cougar snarling) - Nice kitty. (cougar snarling) (suspenseful music) (cougar snarling) (Masha growling) (mysterious music) Cool, this is a big cave, Masha. No snakes in here, I hope. - Mr. and Mrs. Bradley? I need to ask you a question. - What is it, Sergeant? Does this by any chance belong to your daughter? - Yeah, I gave that to her. - Where'd you find it? - Some ground searchers found that pen near a hunters blind that had been torn apart, apparently by a bear. - What, you think that a bear attacked Emily? - We're not saying that, ma'am, but play it. (Masha grunting) (whimsical music) (Emily sneezes) - I don't know how Masha survives out here on her own. It's really tough living in the wilderness (sneezes), but at least she's got her independence. (fish thuds) Gross, ew, Masha! (Emily gasps) (Emily grunts) - The police told the paper that they think that a bear got to Emily. - Melissa, Emily is alive. I know she's alive, and we're not going home until we find her. (suspenseful music) - That looks like Emily's, that looks like Emily's bike! - [Sara] What? - It is, stop, go back, that's Emily's bike. - Are you sure? - [Melissa] Yes. - [Sara] Is it hers? - Yeah, it is, it's her bike. (suspenseful music) - Come on, come on. (suspenseful music) (knocking on door) Hello, hello! Excuse me, sir, where did you get that bike? - Emily left it here. - You were at the protest the other day. - I'm John Ours. - Yes, well, when did Emily leave the bike here? - Come in, I'll tell you all about it. - Where are the stupid planes? (suspenseful music) - Just keep still. - Just keep still. You'll get your shot. - Come on, bear. Show your furry face. (suspenseful music) Got her! (rock thuds) (gun firing) - What're you doing? - Since when do bears throw rocks? - Bears don't throw rocks. - Then who just throw rock at me? - I didn't see a rock. Maybe it was the kick of your gun. - I'm telling you somebody or something just threw a rock at me and took off. - (laughs) You're becoming the king of excuses, you know that? - Oh my, well, I see you like to keep pets. - Not really, I just take care of them until they're well enough to return to the forest. - Are all of them sick? - They suffer from herbicide poisoning. - Very toxic herbicides. The loggers are too lazy to cut through the brush, so instead they just spray everything in their path. - Trouble is they breath the spray and or eat the plants, and it makes them ill. - I see, so tell me again. You took Emily to meet Melissa? - Yeah, I felt it was dangerous for a person so young to be traveling alone, so I offered my help. When I last saw her she had just bravely saved a bear's life, and she was leaving the camp with you. When I came home I heard the terrible news. - Well um, the searchers, they found this recording pen. - Well um, the searchers, they found this recording pen. It belongs to Emily, just listen. (Masha grunting) - [John] That would be the bear. - Police believe that it's a bear, and that the bear has attacked Emily. - You have no need to worry, Sara. Your daughter will return soon. Your daughter will return soon. She'll be a stronger person for having made this journey. (suspenseful music) - These are the hunter's, aren't they? (Masha grunting) It's the enemy camp. We must be very careful. No, Masha. (Masha grunting) I know you're mad they tried to shoot you, but I don't think we should hang around here very long. They might come back. (Masha grunting) Masha! (Masha chewing) Yes! (whimsical music) We have a radio, Masha. I've seen this in movies. Mayday, mayday, ah, 10-4, over and out. (loggers chattering) - More coffee, boys? - Oh, yeah. - Yes, please, sir. - Hello, can anyone hear me on this thing? - Hey, guys, quiet, quiet, please. - What's up? - Nothing, I just thought I heard something. - Oh, no. - Hello, well, it's in the movies. Hello, this is Emily Bradley. Can anyone hear me out there? - This is Scott at Great Pacific. I hear you, Emily. Do you copy, over? - I hear you. Can you come and get me? - Whose CB are you on? Has someone found you? - No, I sneaked into one of the hunters tent to use the radio and. (Masha grunting) - That sounds like a bear. - Emily, what was that? Are you okay? - Shh, go away. I'm fine. (Masha grunting) - [Scott] Emily, why don't you tell the hunters that you're lost, and get them to take you to the police. - No, they'll kill Masha. (suspenseful music) (Masha grunting) Can you come and get me? I'm on a mountain. - [Scott] What mountain? Do you know where you are? - It's near some old ruins. - Well, would you look at that. Take your shot. (gun firing) (suspenseful music) (gun firing) (suspenseful music) - Emily, do you copy, over? Emily, Emily, do you copy? - [Melissa] What's going on? - I think I know where your sister is, come on. (suspenseful music) - [Hunting Guide] There! (gun firing) (suspenseful music) (Emily grunting) (gun firing) - I thought I saw it. (suspenseful music) (Emily grunting) (suspenseful music) - [Hunting Guide] There! (gun firing) (speaking in foreign language) (Masha grunting) - Masha! (suspenseful music) Uh oh. (Masha whimpering) (snake hissing) (suspenseful music) (snake hissing) (suspenseful music) - Well, finish her off. (Masha whimpering) - Hold on. - What? - Well, look where you're aiming. You don't want a bear head mounted in your living room that's got a bullet hole in it. Shoot her here, here. (suspenseful music) (bear growling) - I hate snakes! (helicopter humming) Help, I'm here, down here, help! (helicopter humming) Come back, please, come back. - I don't know what to tell ya. This is the only mountain near the ancient ruins. (mysterious music) - [Melissa] Scott, look at that cliff down there! - Somebody's signaling. Hey, Al, take it to your right. (whimsical music) - Yes! (whimsical music) - Come on, come on! (whimsical music) Come on! (whimsical music) - Oh, Emily, I'm so glad that you're okay. - [Emily] I missed you. - [Melissa] Everyone, we found Emily, she's alive. (rescue team cheering) (whimsical music) (Masha whimpering) - [Emily] I see her. - Where? - We have to get Masha to a vet. - You serious? - We have to take the bear with us. - I don't have the right gear to transport a bear. - She's been shot. She could die if she doesn't get help. - I'm sorry, kid, I can't. - Why not, Al? I've seen this chopper lift trees the size of small cars. What the heck, why not a bear, huh? - She saved my life, please. (whimsical music) - Everyone, to Emily Bradley, the bravest member of Paw Patrol. - Hear, hear. - [Daniel] Hear, hear. - Here, it's yours. - Cool. - And these are for you. I hope you feel better. - Thanks. - [Scott] Anyways, I gotta get going to work. - Oh, you're not gonna stick around for a bit? - Actually, I only came by to uh, to drop this off. - That's the tape. How'd you get that? - Don't ask. - You do know we're gonna have to use this against your father's company. - Yeah, I know. - Thank you. - See ya. - Don't forget, I have to interview you for my story. - [Scott] Okay. - Well, this oughta make the front page. - [Emily] Soon Masha was well again. John took care of her and made her all better, and she was almost ready to go back to the forest again. We both are going to be okay. (whimsical music) - Emily. - Emily. (whimsical music) - [Emily] Masha went back to her beautiful forest, because bears need a home just like we do, and I'm gonna help Melissa and Paw Patrol to make sure that Masha's home is kept safe for her and her friends.
