MARCH 2018 We're going in, Ute? SCARY HOUSE INVESTIGATION - Sure. - Is it crowded? Are we seriously going in, Te? Is it safe? - It's crowded. - Crowded? But, it's okay. No one is angry. It's okay. It's after office hours. Come on in. Slowly. - Te... - What's wrong, Te? - No, no! - What's wrong, Te? Dear Allah, this girl is so brave. No need to look. Don't look? So what should I do, Te? There's something above us. - Above us? - Exactly above us? What does it look like? Hanging. Hanging. - Really, Te? - Hey, Ajil, don't. Ajil, listen to her. No, I'm just curious. Who knows... You have no spiritual powers. She does, and she said no. There are more peeking now. What about here? In the corner. Which corner, Te? There are many corners. That corner. - That corner? - Don't point. - Argh, my leg! - Argh, cockroaches! - Ajil! - Sorry, sorry, I swear. Remember, you sleep outside tonight. Sorry, something touched my feet. Something went past you. - A boy or a girl, Te? - Really, Te? It's getting hotter here, I'm getting nervous. Seriously, I swear. All right, calm down. Calm yourselves. Viewers, calm yourselves. Te, what's in here? The ruler of this territory. - The king? - Yes, he's on patrol. He just wants to be greeted. - Greeted?! - We have to say... May peace be upon you, Raden Aji. - May peace be upon you, Raden Aji. - May peace be upon you, Raden Aji. Well, you tell him to calm down. We're not spending the night here, really. They are not the type who hold grudges. They don't like to prank. They probably just like to tease. Ute, what's that on your right? - What's on our right? - That, over there. - Where? - There, right there. I saw something move, I swear. I swear, I just saw something move. AUGUST 2019 Hello! You're back again with me, Ute, on Terawang Tangan (hand reading). Palm lines consist of three main lines. The first is the heart line. - Then, the head line. - Yes. And finally, the life line. Your life line is quite long and clearly visible. It means you are energetic and healthy, you don't easily get sick. But, at the base of the thumb, it splits in two. Why? Perhaps, when you were a kid, you often got sick? Sensing the mystical, the supernatural... It happens very often, to this day. Yes, you can see based on the trauma... Three people will not survive! Three people will not survive! Keanu and I want to clarify the situation about the Terawang channel which is no longer active. We will make a new channel. It will be better than Terawang. The name is Mystical, Funny 'n Total. Otherwise known as MKN. Please like and comment. - Share it with your friends. - Just watch. Bye, everyone. Thank you for watching, bye. JUNE 2022 Hello, guys. Your hand is covering. Hi, guys. Right now, Ajil and I are going to Cirebon. Yes. Can you move back a little? Shut up. Maybe you've never seen Umay on our YouTube channel. But Umay here is our old friend, and he is a filmmaker. You're a filmmaker? Yes. What kind of movies have you made? Film assignments on campus. Films on campus, assignments. We're not that different. So now I, Keanu, and Umay are going to Cirebon... - to make content. - We're picking up his friends? Yes, we are going to pick up your friends. - They... - They're majoring in dance. - Okay. - I'm majoring in film. I want... What's it called? I want to record... - their research process in Cirebon. - Okay. - Oh, so it will be a documentary? - A documentary. Why did you name it MKN? Because we are Mystery... Mystical! - Mystical. - Funny. - MFT, not MKN. - MKN. If it's MFT... I don't like the T. I like the N. What should I do? MFNT, right? Mystery, Funny 'n Total. Yes, I don't want the "Total," but "'n Total." Why "'n Total"? Because there's "'n Tot" in the name. So people will remember. Stop. Watch where I'm going. - I go in too? - I'll hold it. May. - Have you met them? - No. What is this, a vlog? Making vlogs? - No, silly. This is a documentary. - What? Oh, hello. So, this is Umay Shahab's campus, guys. We will see Umay meeting his future wife. So, guys, because Umay likes Arla, he paid for all the expenses for our trip to Cirebon. Awesome, right? - For real? - Go up, you idiot. Just go up, there. - This is what we do every day. - We'll fix the tempo first. Isn't that right, La? Right? - Yes. - We practice every day, right? So we can be perfect and not make mistakes. Right? Arla. Seven... Hey! I have to go, guys. Bye! Take off your shoes first. - What? - Take off your shoes first. Sacred limit. Wait there. A bit far. Wait, wait. Hello. Oh, you're the one. Yes. Turn right. How about you, are you all ready? Ready? Wait, I'm preparing. All right, gosh. Just prepare. Scary setup. These are all expensive, guys. You talk too much. Here's our source. She's also Umay's... Can't you leave me alone? Gosh. - I agreed to make a documentary. - Yes. Not to make your YouTube content. Because my friends are YouTubers, I'm sure they can also help you make behind-the-scenes footage because... They can. Because... If they bother us and ruin the assignment... - They won't. - It will be on you. It won't be ruined. Hi, I'm Arla. I'm in the Faculty of Dance, final semester. And I'm going to Cirebon. We're going to research the Cirebon mask dance. I'll be with Maura and Jojo, working on our thesis. It's inspired by the maestros of mask dance, like the late Mimi Rasinah, Mimi Tumus... And coincidentally this is something that I haven't explored much myself. Okay, great. - All good? - All good. - I'm the one that's scared. - Me, take my shot. I have questions about the camera. I want to be a YouTuber too. Please, we've had it with your IG stories. - Oh! - What? - Let's talk about Keanu. - It's really hot here, you know? Didn't you two have another YouTube channel? Oh, right. With that girl, right? - Yes! It was Ute. - Yes. No wonder I feel like I've seen you and Ajil. What was the name? Come on, let's discuss something else, okay? Okay, let's change the topic. Umay, Jil, let's eat. I have to, um... Catch the sunset. I have to take a beauty shot for my documentary's opening. There's food in the back. Snacks. - Where? - In the middle. There. - Bread, that's all we got. - You want some bread? You want me to eat biscuits!? The important thing is to eat, right? It won't be long. Hi, I'm back. Miss me? So, we have arrived in Cirebon. Come on, put it on. Help her, let's hurry. Maura has been helping from the start. What are you doing? I'm helping too. Support. I'm the "hurray team." Don't be upset. Umay won't like you anymore. I don't care. You know back then, In Dono movies... On their beach scenes, they always had these girls. Warkop girls. Come on. Pose, pose. Damn! The name is here, but it's just the road. The rest is not here anymore because it's not loading. There are no other cars, damn it. - Umay. - Huh? - Are we lost? - Yes. No need to think about me and my friends who are tired of dancing for you, okay? For your documentary. Just look at your friends. I feel sorry for them. They also want to eat. - There are needs that I have to fulfill... - Your needs, yeah. It's your need too. That I accommodate. No, wait... - Ajil, don't be like that. - Ajil, what the hell? I'd rather hear this car horn than your incoherent bickering. Don't be like that. The three of us here are having a hard time. Please understand each other. - I'm trying to understand you too. - All right, should we stop here? - Should we stop here? - Keanu too. - Jil, I don't want this car to stop, Jil. - I don't understand anything. - All right, I'm going. - Yes, but... - Don't fight, please. - Okay. The benefit is for the three of us. Damn it, what the hell was that? What was that? All right, let's just bury it. - What? - Let's just bury it. Where should we bury it? Do you have a shovel? What should we bury it with? - So what are you going to do? - Try. We can't just leave it like this. Our journey is just beginning. We'll be here for a month. Do you want us to have bad luck? - Jil, pick it up with your clothes. - Nothing's wrong with... All right, Jil... Umay! - Forgive us. - Umay! Forgive us, Cat. Arla! Do you have any sanitizer or anything like that? Are you going to leave it like that? What else? I asked for forgiveness. We're just passing by. Sorry, Arla... Come on, find a place to eat. - What's important is our good intent. - Come on. - Can you shut up? - Come on. - Please stop. - You want us to get back soon, right? May, don't be like that. - Oh, this is the square. - The Great Mosque. - Here's the square. - This is the square. The square! What is this place? I'm so tired, Jil. Come on. "Hotel Asia." Which way? - How much? - No. Excuse me. May, we're seriously staying here? What about other options? There are no options. This place has the best price for two weeks. - Yes? - Reservation for two rooms. For Umay. Ma'am, can we order some food? You can't. It's late. - It's late, so we can't? - Yes. There's nothing at all? - No. - All right, all right. - This way. - Okay. What's this? - What? - Here. This is our toilet? Is this the bathroom? What's that for? What? What for? So... Like, when people... - "fool around" here... - Oh my God. Well, that's where they clean themselves. - Oh God... - Is your friend that stupid? - Huh? - Is your friend that stupid? - Yes... - Yes, I know. - This is... - But please think about us. I've seen the room. Think about me too. I told you before. - What, about the budget? - Yes, of course. Let's move to another hotel. I'll pay. - You'll pay for everything? - Yes. - Everything? - Yes. You'll pay for my gas? Everything? The trip? And if the distance to the dance school is further away, you'll pay for that too? You'll pay for eating at another hotel where everything's more expensive? - The problem is... - For two weeks, you'll pay? No, this place is inhabitable. Perhaps you can be louder, so... Yes, ma'am. Try speaking louder. Then the receptionist lady will get angry. She'll call people around here and they'll beat us up. - It's okay, speak louder. - Look right there. That's my vlog. I'll edit it. Hello. Hi, guys. Fuck you, Umay! Piece of shit! I can't sleep in a place like this. I can't take it anymore. I've done it all just to make my parents proud. I have to do all of this just to have that. Jo? Just a moment. Yes, Nu? Jo? What's wrong, Jo? Why are you crying, Jo? Nothing. What's wrong, Nu? I want to ask for help. I'm scared. The bathroom is so far away. I want to take a shower. Can you please accompany me? Where are Umay and Ajil? I don't know where Umay is. Ajil sleeps like a log. Okay, hold on. - Are you all right, Jo? - I'm okay. Just a moment. Hey, out of the way. Move, you idiot. I'm recording. - Move. - Don't bother people this late, you idiot. - Why are you bothering me? Get lost. - You suck. - Stupid Umay. - Shut up. Wait, what do we have here? Coin rub. What's in here? Damn it! What was that? - Jil, Jil. - What is it? Don't tell the girls. Here. Do you see it? A storeroom, idiot. Come on, let's go. - Come on. - Come on, Mau. Maura, come on. - Yes, hello. - Badriyah. - This is Ajil, Jojo, and Maura. - Hello, Jojo. Hi. We're the ones doing the research. We are looking for Mimi Kemuning. - Miss, who are you? - Badriyah. When can we visit the dance school? - Now is all right. - Now? Yes, you can. Please introduce her. Oh, right. This is Badriyah. She's our fixer. We met her because of our social media post. And actually, we didn't find Badriyah. Badriyah was the one who found us. Hello, hi. He's a local here. We're just talking... For content. I don't know what all this is, but it's delicious. Enjoy your meal. - Which one's the house? - This one. We're here, miss. We're here? May peace be upon you. - Hello? - Looks like no one lives here. It smells damp, you know? So uncomfortable. - Are you sure this is the place? - Just a minute. - Do you come here often? - It's like nobody's lived here for ages. No, but my uncle said Mimi Ning, used to live here. Yes, it says "dance school." - I swear, a 1,5 hour trip. So tired. - Yes, we can read the sign. - Maybe we... - Hi, sir. - Good day, sir. Hi, sir. - Sir. - Badriyah. - Keanu. - Excuse us, sir. - Excuse us. Can I smoke in the house, sir? - Those fabrics are nice, sir. - Ajil. - Yes, sir. They're still very durable. - This house is perfect for making content. For content. - These clothes come with their masks. - Looks awesome. - Amazing. - And this one's for... This is Mimi Ning's room. - Want to look inside? - Yes, sir, if we may. All right, one moment. Wait here. Let him cleanse the room. Huh? What? I don't know. - These are her old pictures? - Yes. - My God, so pretty. - That's Mimi Ning's photo. Oh, photos... Oh. Everything is well-preserved. - It's still all here, sir. - Yes. I'm more interested in these masks. - Like a horror movie set, huh? - Yeah. Now, this... These are the masks that they wear when they dance. Yes, yes. What is this, sir? A room. Usually, after the dancers performed, when it was late, they'd sleep here. - Oh, spent the night. - Yes, spent the night here. If you want to wait here, while I look for Mimi Ning, it's okay. - Oh... - We have booked a hotel in... - Let's stay here instead. - All right, it's okay. Staying here is better. Easier access, right? - What's that behind you, sir? - Ah, that... Gamelan storage room. This is really cool. But nobody lives here, sir? Just me, to take care of things. - But you live near here, sir? - Yes, I live next door. What is this for, sir? What? Sorry. This item especially... Do not open this. - Oh, sorry, sir. - I'm sorry. Sir, may I know, where did Mimi Kemuning go, and why did she stop dancing? Well, they said that Mimi Ning was asked to sign something by the government, when in fact, everyone knew that Mimi Nining... Mimi Nining can't read. So. Then, suddenly... Well, Mimi Nining was accused of misappropriating the funds for the dance art development. The news spread. - After that, Mimi Nining was disappointed. - Yes. She decided not to dance anymore. She left this place. I and all my friends have come all the way from Jakarta. Um, coincidentally... We'd like to make the Caruban Larang Dance School and Mimi Kemuning the topic for our thesis. And coincidentally, I also intend to get a scholarship, sir. So if there's even the slightest possibility for us to meet Mimi Kemuning, can you help us? Well... I'll try. But I can't promise anything. Hello. Welcome back to the MKN channel. I'm in Cirebon. This is a really good location. Perfect for horror stories. I happen to have a story. Very scary. So, there was an ambulance driver. His name was Mamat. Now, Mamat was offered a job to deliver a dead body. But the destination was far away, out of town. So, he needed a friend to take turns driving, see? Finally, he took his son. His name was Ujul. "Jul, go with me, okay?" Finally, they left. It was in the middle of the night. He was speeding. Suddenly someone passed in front of the car. Bam! Mamat, the father woke up. "What's wrong? Why did you brake suddenly like that?" Ujul said, "So what?!" No, no, kidding. "I just hit a person." "What person?" "I don't know, Dad. I hit a person." "Speak properly!" "All right, I actually hit a cat." "What cat?" He hit his son, "Hey!" The son said, "Damn it!" No, kidding. They delivered the corpse. All done, they went home. So, as an ambulance driver, after delivering a corpse, the car has to be washed, the ambulance. "Jul, you wash it. I'm going to bed." Mamat went to sleep. Ujul said, "Fine, maybe later." "I'm tired too. I'll take a shower first." He took a shower. After jerking off, he got tired and fell asleep. Mamat had a wife. Her name was Ipeh. At 2 a.m., there was a sound at the door. Bang, bang! "Yeah, hold on." Like that. You know, when someone knocks on the door, they should be facing the front, right? Like, here's the door. I'm the one knocking. Like this, right? But the person faced backward, like this. Can you imagine? Suddenly the person turned around. Bam! It was her husband's face, Mamat. "I told you to wash the ambulance!" Ipeh was shocked. "Huh?" From behind her, Mamat came out of his room. He'd been sleeping. "Peh, who are you talking to?" When she looked, there was no one in front of the door. I'll help you after this Mamat content. Here's Mamat. After delivering the corpse... What's with you? The one behind him is Ujul. - Have you eaten yet? - Not yet. Hold on. - Here, I'll put your stuff here, okay? - Yes. Be careful. I'll put some on top, okay? Excuse me. That's someone else's property. I'm scared to even point at it and you want to open it. Are you crazy? - Oh, how scary. - Stop acting like it's a horror movie. This was the comedy part. - Thank you for coming with me to buy food. - Yes, you're welcome. By the way, Badriyah, you are from here, right? - Yes. - Ladies. I'm recording... Don't... Not there, I moved the chairs. - Just move them again. - Easy for you to say. - Not here. - Hey, stop! There's the camera there, look. - May. - Come on, May. - Help me grab the water gallon, please. - Let's eat here for a minute. Poor guy. Okay, guys, we're having lunch. We have some fried rice. Because in this place, the fried rice is "noon fried rice." That's right. Shut up! Makes me want to scream. I swear, Badriyah hasn't eaten since this morning. - Miss! - Ms. Badriyah. Let's eat, miss. No thanks, miss. I ate at home earlier. - Miss? Bad? - Yes. I call her Bad, Bad. I'm so tired of all of you. Mau, you'll choke yourself. Don't die just yet. - Oh, she hit her head! - Don't be like that. No, no! Badriyah, don't open it! Ms. Badriyah, remember what Mr. Djalil said. We mustn't open this. I'm sorry, miss. Because it was dusty, I thought it needed to be cleaned. This... This is what's inside? This is so old. What year is this? That's the Cirebon Palace in the '40s, sir. Smells like flowers, huh? Ken, we'll be rich. - Arla. - Yes? Do you remember the position? - We're recording this. - The outfits are complete. Don't change the position. - The smell is... - Smells great, seriously. Seriously. Maybe this could be our thesis material? Sure. Take some pictures. Allah is the Greatest. - Umay! - May! Stop playing music. I'm really scared Mr. Djalil will come, I swear. What? - Mr. Djalil will come. - No, he's looking for... who? Mimi Kemuning. - That's... - It looks like... Yes, Jil. - Really good. Can we do this? - I'm serious, this is money. Maura! Jojo! - What? - You startled me. - Can we? - We got the assignment for our research. Seriously? - Arla, you go. - Okay. So, we just got the link to this article from our dance teacher, Mrs. Dainta. About... - So it turns out... - So it turns out... The artifacts we just found in this box are evidence of this lost dance. So, in the 1940s, in the Cirebon Palace area, there was a very popular dance that was performed to welcome royal guests. But why is it called the lost dance? Was there no successor? Or...? - We don't know. - There wasn't any. No one preserved this dance. - It's been forgotten. - It disappeared. So now, we are officially looking for the lost dance. I'm very excited. What happened here?! You startled me. - Uh, sir... - Why did you open this box? Mr. Djalil, may I ask if you know who this is? Oh, this... I think it's... She used to be the legend of this dance school. Her name... Suryani. She's Suryani. She left the Cirebon Palace. Since... She left and... Well, no one else knew the dance. Back with me, Keanu, on the YouTube live stream Mystical, Funny 'n Total. I will be accompanied by a dancer. She is very good at dancing, and very beautiful. Her name is Jojo. Please come into the frame. Very interesting. There are lots of heirlooms here. For example, ordinary dolls. If we just leave them for a long time, something may inhabit them. How much more so this dance equipment, right? - Yes. - Right? Traditional dances are... um... they're very cultural, right? Indonesian culture is mystical. - Yes. - Am I right? There are many types of mask dance, right, Jo? What are they? - There's the Samba mask dance. - Samba. The one I performed yesterday. At the beach? So the dancers used to learn to dance here. There's this too, the leathered horse. We have a gamelan set too. THIS IS JUST A GIMMICK They say, if we play it, something will come. WHERE'S THE GHOST? IT'S JUST WHAT THEY SAY RIGHT? WHO WILL COME? WHAT'S WRONG WITH JOJO? STARTING TO FEEL SOMETHING? Let's see. SHE CLOSED HER EYES LOL GIMMICK JUST GO TO SLEEP, JO It looks so difficult. Very difficult. Any longer, and I'll exorcise you. IT'S A PRANK Keep quiet. LOL IT'S TERRIBLE What's wrong, Jo? I TOLD YOU - Jo? - I'm tired, damn it. I want to sleep. - Come on, Jo... - Jo... Hey, calm yourselves down. There will be more guest stars. I'll summon one first. I'M SO CALM THEN WHAT? This is a ritual that Keanu often does for summoning. This guest star. It has to be the right person. I'm looking for her. Where is she? Welcome. - Back with me. - Nu. - On our live... What? - Nu. - What? - I'm sleepy, Nu. I know you're sleepy, but it'll just be a moment. Help us out, Mau. Turns out that in this house, in this dance school, something already existed. IT LOOKS SCARY Even before this building was made. This is very interesting. But I dare not do this myself. WHERE ARE YOU TAKING HER TO? THE PLACE IS SO SCARY This is the well, guys. THERE ARE SO MANY WELLS IN MY HOMETOWN - This? - Yes. In the past, they said... there were a lot of natives put in here by... DARK By the Japanese army. - Huh, what do you mean? - Put in? There were many natives who were killed here. - Dumped here? - But we don't know... Damn it! What is that? Damn it, don't do that! - I want to hit... - No, no! Dear Allah, have mercy! - Ouch! - Dear Allah. - Uh, Jil... - Hey! That was so stupid. - What? No, no. - I didn't sign up for this. - Turn it off. - Wait, if I turn it off... I said turn it off! YouTube will blank our live feed! - Please wait. - Turn it off. You didn't ask me to discuss it. - You're crazy. - We met the guy, Arif, yesterday. Who's Arif? I didn't say a single word to Arif, asshole! - Because you were with them all the time. - Hey, can you please... - Calm down. - What do you mean, I was with them? - I've never had a problem with taking... - Jil, enough. I drive, do all kinds of things. I don't care, whatever. Because I care about you. But you give no feedback. I should've stayed friends with Ute! Bastard! We create content, Keanu! You know we make content but without that fake kuntilanak shit, Ajil! Hey, knock it off! - Hey, shut up. - You shut up, asshole! You shut up, asshole! You bastard! That's enough, break it up. No, I want to know why he's like this. I'm just asking. - Sorry, I asked nicely. - Jil, don't listen. I regret having a bullshit person like you as a friend. Fine, then don't! Go with Ute, that shaman. - Eat that! - Ajil, stop. Occult dog shit. Terawang! Hello, everybody. MKN CLARIFICATION VIDEO MKN here. Back with us. Here...

We're so sorry. - We're not like that, guys. - We're so sorry. Last night was garbage. But... I'm here to say, I don't know what happened last night. - MKN is not like that, as you know, guys. - No. Our previous content, it's not been like that, so... KEEP GOING, MKN!

Go back. - Calm down. Come on. - Come on. Let's leave. - Wait. We need to replace yesterday's content. Be patient. Keep recording. - Hey. - Huh? What? That iron from before. Here. Oh, Allah. Okay, it's clear. - Are you okay? - All good. For... Dear Allah! Keanu! Allah is the Greatest! - What was that? - Ken... This is where you bathe corpses, Ken. Ken, what's that sound? Run! You hear that? - The water's on! - The water's on! Ken! All right, Ken. Hold the camera. I swear. I can't take it anymore. Guys. I'm asking for your help. If you... If we don't survive... Huh? Huh? What? What? There is a ghost! Run! - There? Or there? - This way. This way. Calm down. Over here. - Ken. - Come on, hurry up. - Hurry! - Damn it. Hurry up, Jil. Come on. Wait. Damn it! Ken! Come on, Jil. Switch. Dear Allah, have mercy. Dear Allah, have mercy. What? - Ken... - What? Follow me. Ken! Get out of here! What happened? Are you okay? What? Ute? - Get out! - What's going on? What is it? - What's going on? - Everyone's safe? Safe? What's wrong? - I'll go back in. I'm going to Ute. - What are you doing? - Just stay here. - Ute is alone! Jil! Who told you to play jelangkung here? Why are you here, huh? - Answer me first. Who played jelangkung? - Answer me. What are you doing here? Ken... Not even a thank you? I saved you. - I'm asking nicely. - Ute... - I saved you. - I'm asking nicely. No gratitude at all. What are you doing here? - Remember. - Ken, hey. Give it a rest. I've been your friend for 8, 9 years. I never taught you to play jelangkung in a place like this. As a friend, I also have never... - What? - Stolen your stuff. - This is risky, you know? - Hey... - What risk? - Do you know what kind of place this is? What do you know? Who taught you? Please stop this. Yes, we're sorry, Te. Crazy, this girl is deaf. - Sorry, this... - Whatever. - You thief. Bitch. - Ken. Fine, whatever with the jelangkung. Who opened the box which shouldn't be opened? - Box? - Huh? - Who opened it... - Jil, let's go back! You startled me, stupid. - Sorry. Without me, Terawang... - Is that channel yours? Excuse me. Without me, what will it be? I'm the indigo. What the heck? What did you do? You were just the creative writer. As an indigo, you weren't so creative, bitch! Enough. The neighbors are watching. I feel bad. - They might get upset at us. - He's the one being loud. - Can you lower your voices? - Yes. - Come with me. - Okay. - Ken... - I want to close the door. All right, all right. Calm down. I just want to close the door. Gosh! Do you remember why I took the Terawang channel? Three years ago. I received a dream. I had that dream many times. It was from my companion spirit. It said, "Tigo tiyang boten wilujeng." - Tigo tiyang... - Boten wilujeng. Which means? "Three people will not survive." I never uploaded this because... See for yourself. Tigo tiyang boten wilujeng. My companion spirit got so angry at me. And I saw a box, what I said earlier. It mustn't be opened, but it's been opened. - Jil. - Hey. - Ajil. - Sorry, sorry. Ute, I'm sorry if we're bothering you. Um... But, Ute, can we ask you for help? We have the photos. This is Suryani's photo. Here are the pictures of her and the dancing team. So, these photos are from the box which mustn't be opened. We need to know, where can we learn the dance? We need... either the successor or anyone trained, I don't know. Nowadays, to find something missing, we can share a thread on Twitter. - Damn it, May. - There, problem solved. What was the information? Their latest news? The point is, no one knew where they went. Gone. They were made into "jugun ianfu." - Huh? - "Jugun ianfu"? Jugun ianfu. - Slaves? - The Japanese army's sex slaves. I need something more personal. Ute? What's wrong, Te? Te, what's wrong? - Ute? - What's happening? Damn it! - What's the matter? - Allah is the Greatest! Get some water. - What happened? - I don't know, she's coughing blood. - Pick her up. - All right, come on. Careful. Drink first, Te. Come on, there, there. - There's so much blood on the floor. - Are you okay? - Are you all right, Te? - What's wrong, Te? - Te? - What now? - Ah, shit. Guys. - Oh no. Suryani wants to dance in front of all of you. Huh? Let's leave. - Umay! - Hey, don't! - Umay! - Get out, get out. Get out. Close the door, Jil. Close it! Close it, Jil! The commenters are still mocking us, calling it a setup. - No one believes us. - Last night, I mean. I mean, it's crazy, you know? The problem is the same every day. I'm tired. I'm heading back. - Damn it! - Why did you call me? No, no... Sorry. Just kidding, man. What's with her? Not showering. Bare feet... Watch where she's going. Damn it! - This guy is really... - Can't you wait a second? - Jil, hold him off. - We're talking about something important. Is he still mad? There is one way, but I don't recommend it. Well, basically Suryani said, she wants to preserve the dance. She wants people to see it. - So there can be a successor. - Okay, we want to see it too. That's our goal too, so... But the method that's not recommended, you mean...? - What should we do? - Yeah. - Welcome. - Yes, we can start soon. - Can you do it, Umay? - I can't. - Use yours. - All right, I'll do it. - Ready, Arla? - Ready. I intend to summon a friend to come. I wish for the one called Suryani to be present here. Dance, Suryani. Child, halt! Stop this, child. Stop. Don't continue. Child, it's me, Mimi. Please, sir. My goodness, stop. - Please stop this! Dear Allah! - Mimi... It can't be stopped. Arla. Maura! Mau, come on, wake up. - Can I see her? - Yes, please. Child. Child? Don't touch her. Don't touch Maura! Arla. Yes, yes. I know, hold on. - This is a hospital. - Calm down. There's something you don't understand, child. Something you don't comprehend. I just want to explain. - There, there. - But... This dance is rare. It mustn't leave the palace. If you insist on learning this dance, you will not survive. Don't continue this. Maura's family? - Yes? - Please come to the room immediately. Come on! - Maura! - Clear! Calm down, Jo. Ken! According to our medical diagnosis... everything's fine with her, all good. We're still looking for the answer. So I ask you, Ajil and friends, to be patient or follow my advice from before. Return Maura to her family in Jakarta. It could be a near-death experience. - Her soul... A near-death experience. - What? Near death? Her soul is in another realm, and... it could be that Suryani is holding her. Come on, the sanest decision would be to stop all these projects. Documentary, thesis, whatever. We have a victim here. I think the best decision is for you guys to return to Jakarta. Move Maura to a bigger hospital that's more sophisticated. Well, try talking to them. I'm just recording. - No, no. - I'm telling you. - That's it, I'm leaving. I'm done. - Please don't. I have nothing else to do here. No, there is more to do, Te. Only you understand this. She's afraid that the curse will also fall on the children who wanted to learn the dance? Yes, it's possible. Because indeed... Please wait, sir. Doing the ritual is so wrong. It brings risks. I don't want to take any more risks. - What's going on? - If it is risky... - why didn't you insist on preventing it? - What's the matter, Jil? - What do you know? - I'm not hiding anything. - There's a way to save Maura. I know. - That's just your assumption. - There's a way to save Maura. - No, no. - I'm sure. - I'm leaving. My work is done here. How can you save Maura? Ute knows how to save Maura. But she won't tell us. - No, no. - Save Maura? How do we save Maura? Listen, that's just Ajil's assumption. - Ute, please, please. - My job is done here. - Please. - I'm leaving. If there is a chance, no matter how small, please. - There isn't any! - Won't you try it? It's you who wants to perform this ritual. I don't want to take any risks! If there's a way, please help us! Ute told me there was. If she tells me how to do it, I will tell you, yes. I'm sorry. - You idiot, I don't want to! - Ute! - Please, please! - Go on, hit me. That's enough. We don't need her! - Just go home! - Listen to him. Never come again. No reconciliation. I don't want to know you anymore. I no longer care about you, you hear me? I don't want to see you again! I don't want to miss you anymore! Take Terawang with you! No matter how much I care for you, I will not look for you again. Ute is my friend, not yours, you know? - I'm the one who hurts the most, you know. - Yes, I know. I'm so tired of feeling this. I told you not to let her come again. Let's find another way. It's no use, okay? Come on. Come on, find a way that makes more sense. She's not going to help us anymore. You gave them false hope, you know? Yes, because I know she... Know what? What you should know is that Ute is cruel, you know that? Ute left us, Jil! But she's waiting for you now... I really hate drama like this. I don't want this. Do you know why I took over Terawang? It's old news, bitch! - Not that. - It's old news! You left me, Te! - Keanu, listen first. - I have another reason you don't know. - Do you want to know? - I don't care about your excuses. I had a dream... I don't care about your dreams, your excuses. I had a dream that all three of us will die. We mustn't do this. We can't go on. Why did I come back? I had that dream again. Chances are that all three of us will die together. - Turn off the camera. Turn it off. - Wait. - I don't want this recorded! - All right, I can edit it later. Sit down. You know, right? I sometimes get visions. Just snippets, montages, I don't know what it is. In my head, I saw the three of us. If I didn't stop, I was afraid that it would happen. What did I do? I pulled the plug on Terawang. You think it was easy? You think I wanted that? I didn't want it either. I'm sure if I'd told you about the dream three years ago, you'd have tried to figure it out. "Screw it, Te. Let's find a way." Right? You don't even believe it now. Do you believe me? What's there to believe? You left us, Te. Stop it. No need to be crazy and ask us to believe you, damn it. She has the video, Ken. Okay. I took the Terawang channel, right? The dream stopped. But suddenly, it came again. And there was a box behind there in my dream. I don't know if it was a coincidence or what. So I came here to prevent it from happening. To keep the three of us safe. But you foolishly joined them. You helped them with their work. What was the reason? To create content? What's it for you? Content? What about them? Scholarship? Thesis? I've been helping MKN since you weren't around. Right? Your stink of sweat. You stink of incense. Oh, you. So Ute explained earlier. Regarding... this thing that doesn't make sense to us. About Maura. Nothing's wrong with her medical record, but she remains in a coma. Uh, her soul... What was it? Maura's spirit has been taken by Suryani. Oh, God. And if we really... want Maura to return here, Suryani has one condition. What? We must watch Suryani's dance in person, and we have to make sure that the dance will be preserved. That's what we did yesterday. Look what happened to Maura. Yes. There is another ritual. Not like yesterday. Suryani doesn't come here. - Instead, we must go to her realm. - Okay. And the way is, as Ute said earlier, the Pati Geni ritual. What is that? What do you mean? The ritual to move to another realm by being buried alive. Te, what do you mean by being buried alive? - Well, buried. - Yes, I know that. Buried alive. But what do you mean? To enter the other realm. Isn't there another way? There isn't. - That's the only one. - That's all? And you're sure Maura will return if we do that? When we perform the Pati Geni, we go to another world. We still have to find Maura. But we will all return, right? Hello, sis? Hold on. Oh, shit. What's wrong, Jo? Hold on, guys. Jo, come on. - Hey, come on. - I can't do this. I'll plug this in the box's hole. For your air. Later, if anything happens, just pull it. Also, the end of the thread will be tied around the finger of one of us. - Me, me. - Whose finger? Yours? Get in, May. - What? - Get in. Ready? Ute. I'm sorry, Te. If you can't hold it anymore or if there's any other issue, pull the thread. Yes? Okay? I can't start the ritual, if the box is not closed, or if we're not fully buried. - Yes? - Okay. - Jil. Ken. - Yes. You good? Okay, close it, sir. Oh, shit! Careful, close your eyes, guys. - Jo, don't cry yet. - Ken. - Ute, I'm sorry, Te. - Nu. I love you so much. I love you so much! Ken, try pulling the thread. Test it first. The thread is ready. Guys, don't cry. Bury them, sir! - Dear Allah. - Allah is the Greatest! Open it! - Ute! - Te. Hey, don't shout. Don't shout, guys. Jo, Jo. I want to get out! Ute! Make room. Move aside. Okay. Close it, sir. Bury us more, sir! Is it done? The sound of dirt has stopped. Okay. My intention is for Pati Geni. Smoke followed by fire and light. I return to the darkness, like the beginning of life in the forest realm. In the cave of the mother's womb, four brothers become five. The birth of the baby. The fluid, the placenta. Four directions, five bodies, united before God. My intention is for Pati Geni. Okay. Ute? Is this done yet, Te? No, we're still waiting. - I'm going to pull it, Te. - Ken, don't. Isn't this enough, Te? - Are you sure? - I'll pull it, Te. - Ken. - Ken. Not yet, Ken. I can't stand it anymore. Te, I'll pull it. - Ken, wait a bit. - By the name of Allah. - Ken! - I can't stand it anymore! - Keanu! - Ken, did you break it?! - Ken? Keanu! - Help! Sir! Mr. Djalil! Help! Mr. Djalil! - Te, what should we do? - Te. Te, how do we get out? I don't know. What should we do? What should we do, Ta? There is no god but Allah. It's your fault, Keanu! Hey, what's that sound? There is no god but Allah. There is no god but Allah. - Dear Allah. - We're moving! What's going on? Te, what is this? Ute! There is no god but Allah. Open! Get out! Let's go, Nu. Te, where are we? Let's go. Hey, are we there? Ajil! Ute. Te, have we arrived yet? Have we? Why is it bright? Why? Who are they? Hey, Te! There are people! It's an earthquake. Get away! - What's wrong? - Get away from here! Run! Come on! - Ute, come on! - Keanu, run! - Run! - Let's run! You fool! Run! Nu. What are they talking about? - You're lying, Ute. - Don't know. Didn't we already leave? Ken. Keanu. Shall we continue walking? - Let's keep going? - We want to go home. Ute. - We're all getting out of here. - We want to go home, Te. Ute. - Te, what's wrong? - What happened? They're coming with us. They will be my responsibility. Gosh, it's crazy. - So many rocks. - So tired. Te, which way? Huh? What's wrong? - Let her be. - Huh? This way. We climb? Or down there? Through here. - Gosh. - Are you serious? One by one, walk backward, holding on to the sides. Why, Te? What? Okay, it's safe. Don't be surprised. One by one, walk backward, holding on to the sides. Okay? Why is it dark? What do you mean? I swear, it's so dark. Dark? - Te? - Just walk backward slowly. - Slowly, La. - Careful. Be careful. Hold on. What's wrong? It's really dark. - May. - Hey. - You're behind me, right? - All good. - Pop, what should we do? - I'm here, calm down. Jil, come in. - Slow down, Jil. - I'm all right. Where to now, Te? - We're here again, Dha. - Ute? - Come on, come on. - Te. Ouch. How can it be like this? - Where are we going, Te? - I don't know. - What do you mean you don't know? - Te, which way? It's my first time here too. I don't know! Damn it! Then how will we find my friend? - Shut up. - Te, we trusted you! Calm down. Give her some time. We're here because of her! We trusted her solution! Arla... If you want to know where to go, shut up. Listen to what is around us. Understand? Stand back. Ute, what's wrong with her? Te? - Allah is the Greatest. - Where's my staff? - Allah is the Greatest. Ute. - Staff. - What's wrong, Te? - Where's my staff? Keep your distance. This is my staff. - What is happening now? - Te... When the living stay silent... Sadha! Do not be sad, granddaughter of Pramudya Wardani. How pretty. How pretty. Jo, come on. For Maura's sake. Remember Maura. Why is she just walking around? Umay? Bring your ear close, to my friend. - Search. - May... - Yes, I... - Search. Damn it, what's that? What is that? Jil. When the living stay silent, the dead speak. Yes, go on. I'll go with you. - In the name of Allah. - Allah is the Greatest. May peace be upon you. Allah is the Greatest. What did he say? I didn't hear. May peace be upon you. May peace be upon you. May... - Get away from there, May. - I just... - I only heard it in my ear. - May... May, what happened? - Te? - Te, wake up. I just heard... I don't know if it was "burial" or "bury." "Bury the dead." - What does that mean? - I don't know! Not Maura, right? Pick her up. Help Ute. All good, Te? Ken, help Ute. Nu, help Ute. Jo. Stop it. I seek forgiveness from Allah. What is it? You're okay, right? Watch out. Damn it. What was the hint? Umay? Bury the dead. Now you have to bury it. Why me? Ajil ran it over. Because at that time, Ajil was ready to bury it. Yes, it was Ajil who hit it. But you chose to not bury it. You rushed me so we'd get to the hotel quickly and everything. - So we all... we are all in agreement. - Seriously, these two are still fighting. It's your responsibility now. Yours! "It's your responsibility now." Shit! Flashlight. What do I have to bury it with? - A rock, find something. - Think of anything, find a way. Or just use your hands if you have to. You can't be angry either. You were wrong too. You dumped it on the side of the road. Hold my camera. If you drop or scratch it, I'll bury you. Come on, no need to fight. Things are bad already. - Just bury it. - Arla, you too, enough. I'll dump you if you die here. Stop it. This girl has a bitchy mouth. Come on. - Let's take a rest. - Bring it over there. Poppy... Poppy and Migi... How long have you been here? What year is this? - There, there. - What year is it? It's okay. Just focus on finding Maura. Let's hurry out of here, okay? We have to get out of here and the key is Maura. Okay? Te, we want to go home. - Help us, Te! - Yes. I know. How deep did you dig? Quite deep. Where's my camera? There's your grave, check it out. Check it first. Make sure, Arla. It's good. No need to make it so nice. - How else do you want it? - Hey. Hey! - Hey! - Damn it! - Damn it! - Guys. - What's that? - Flashlight, please. - Te, what are you doing? - No, point the flashlight here. "Ndherekake uniane selo." What does that mean? "Follow the sound of the rock." - Come on. - I think it says "rock", right? - Yes, rock... - What's the sound of the rock, Te? - Te? - Come on, that way. - Here, hold this. - Shit, no. It was from a corpse. - All right, Te. - Come on, Te. - Come on, Te! - Yes, yes. Sound of the rock. Allah is the Greatest! - Switch. - All right. Lower your voice. Listen to what's around you, okay? - Careful. - Gosh. Rock sound. The sound is from our right. I don't want to do this. I can't stand it anymore. I want to go back. - What was the clue? - Be quiet, sis. - What's wrong? - The clue is the sound of the rock. - I don't want to go there, I'm afraid! - We have to go there. - That way? - Pass through there? Te, what is that? The instructions say we have to go through there. I can't. - I can't do this. - You can do it. We're not lost anymore. This is the only way. We have to save our friend. Come on. Please. Migi won't come. - She won't come. - Not so loud, La. - Come on, don't stay here for long. - Okay, I'll go first. Why are they just standing there? Walk in a row, one by one, slowly. Come on, Jo. Okay. - Ajil, wait for me. - Let's go. Okay. Allah is the Greatest. Hurry! - Come on. - We're all here. Te, what is that? Te, what's that? - Ute! - Te, come on! - No, no. - Come on, Te! Hold on, hold on! Wait. - What? - No, listen to the dead, hold on. Te? One person should remain here. - Run! - Ajil! - Come on! - Wait! Hey! I'm alone! I'm so stupid. Allah is the Greatest! Dear Allah! Jil. Ajil. Maura? Maura! Come with me, Jil. - Ra? - Hurry up, Jil. - Where are we... Wait. I'll get my camera. - Hurry, Jil. Ra? Maura! Jil. Ajil. Ra? Damn it. Dear Allah! We'd better stick to our main goal and look for Maura. - Let's find Maura first. - Don't be so loud. - Ajil is also in danger. - You don't have to be so loud, please. If we find Maura and go home, what about Ajil? Te, enough. We've lost a lot of our friends. Enough. I'm sure we can find Maura first. - After that... - Hey! Damn it! Hey! Run! Watch out! Dear Allah! - Go back. - Run! - Stupid. - Run! I want to go home! I don't want to be here! - I want to go home! - Yes, we will go home. I don't want to see anything else! We will go home! - We will go home. Ute won't leave us. - Come on, Keanu. Wait! - Jil! - Jil! - Jo, step aside! - Jo! - Get out of there! - No, hold on, hold on! Suryani. Suryani's dance. - Hold. - The missing dancers? Damn it. - Keep quiet. - What's wrong? Shut up, shut up. Can you hear the gamelan sound? Come on. - Can you hear that? - Come on. - From my left. - I can't do this anymore! Where are the others, Pop? Poppy, Sadha. Umay. That's Umay's voice. May! This way. We have to watch this dance until it ends. So we can go home. May, it's Badriyah! Shit. - Hold on, hold on. Don't. - We have to find Maura, Te. Te? So we can go home. Stop, hold on. Te? Te... Te? - Dear Allah, have mercy. - Te. Te, come back here. - Let's get out of here, Te. Come on. - Te. They were kidnapped by Japanese soldiers, right? They managed to escape from the camp. But after they escaped... they committed suicide together. Damn. They couldn't live with the shame. Huh! Te? Follow me. - Ajil, be careful. - Yes, yes. - Dear Allah. - Maura! Maura! - Hold on, hold on! Just a moment. - Te! I'm not sure it's Maura. Don't get too close. Check her first, Te. Check her. Maura! What's happening?! She's back in the hospital! She went back to the hospital, okay? All right, let's go home! Make way. Okay, here, here. Allah is the Greatest. Te. - Where? - Ute. Which way, Te? This is where we return. Where? Jump down. We want to go home, Te. - All right, come on. - Come on. No time to think about it, come on. I'm sure you can. - I'm scared. - You can do it. - In the name of Allah. - Ken. I'll jump first. Okay? - Come on, come on, La. - Be careful. Come on. May, you or me first? You, come on. - Safe? - Be careful, Jil. It's safe. Come on, Mig. - Why? - I can't. Try again. You can do it. Te, come on. - Come on. You can. - I can't. - Let's go home! - We've been here for too long! Ute. - Te. Let's go. - No! I made a promise! - Ute. Come on, Te, there's no time. - We can't go home. - No. - You have to go home. - No, I promised... - Go home! - You have to go home! - No! Ute, listen to me. Listen to me! It's getting bright. The sun is about to rise. You have to go home now. - No! - You have to go home. You have to go home, please. - Te, come on. - Please. I made a promise! Forgive me. - Open up! - Open up! - Open up! Help! - Open up! - Where's my sister? - Miea! - Where's my sister? - Miea! - Miea! - Where's my sister? Where are my friends? "Tigo tiyang boten wilujeng." Three of your friends did not survive. I'm sorry. Forgive me. Miea, I'm sorry. I'm sorry. Guys, turns out we're still vlogging, guys. You thought I'd died, right? I'll hit you, yeah. Please say something this way. Look this way and say something to the MKN audience, those who have followed our journey from the beginning to Cirebon. Say something. I want to dance.
