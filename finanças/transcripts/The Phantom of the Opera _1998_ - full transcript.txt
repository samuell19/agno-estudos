Are you all right? I hope to have fun tonight. This way, sir. He was really kind... Come on, let go of the rope! Stop! -Hey, Gustave! It's lunchtime. Hurry up! -What? Aren't you tired of hanging there like a spider? What the hell is that? Marcel! Pull me up! -What's wrong? -Help me! -Help me! -Let's lift him up! Quickly! Help me! Oh, my God! Help me, Marcel! Help me! Marcel, help me! Who's there? Who's there? Is anyone there? Christine, where are you? I was looking all over for you, my little bird. Come, we have to try your costume. Oh, my goodness. I'll come in a minute, okay? Excuse me? Nothing, my Lady. I thought you said something. No, I didn't. But it's true. I was thinking about you. Thoughts that made me feel surprised. And I'm not easily surprised. You were thinking about me. Why? Because your beautiful voice fills my heart with a heavenly light. Who...? Listening to you is sublime. Wonderful. But this is our secret. Don't tell anyone. -You will know the next time we meet up. -How? When you hear my thoughts, you will know where to go. Yes. I can hear you. Christine. Christine Daae. Don't worry, I won't tell anyone. Gosh! It's so cold. No! No! Her beautiful eyes are so sad She has a fever She doesn't even talk to me My dear, you're different lately. It's not just me saying that. Your mind is always off to somewhere else. Don't tell me you're afraid because of Carlotta? -She's jealous. - I know. Of course, if I were ugly like a crow, and smelled of sweat like her... I would be jealous, too. Come in. -Someone sent these roses. -We couldn't tell it. -For Miss Daae. -Put them over there. - I didn't think they were for me. -Thank you, Kiki. Thank you. They're wonderful. You're so lucky. That must have been very expensive. It must be from a great fan of yours. -Baron Raoul de Chagny sent them. -The one who drools over you! Don't tell me you're in love with that petty man. Where are you? What? Marc! Thank you! Yes, I know she hates me. What should I do? This Maison is a real mess! It's scandalous! Screw it! Yes, sir. I'll be right over. This Degas is an incredible artist. Yes, incredible indeed. Did you bring some sweets for our charming little protegees”? Obviously. I have four pounds of Swiss chocolate. -Good morning, doctor. May I come in? -My dear Montluc, even if I'd say no, -you would come in anyhow. -Nothing gets past Le Coq Républicain. Or your greedy mouth. Mr. Ignace, you're in charge of rodent control at the Opera. Right? Correct. For eight years. I captured 4,837... of those dirty damn beasts! I collect their tails in formaldehyde. -You're very good at your job. -The best! They say somebody forced you to stick your hand in a rat trap. It wasn't somebody. It was nothing! What do you mean, "nothing"? It was like an invisible force. A mysterious force! A creature from hell. Doctor, it hurts! -Is that my thumb? -I'm afraid so. Damn it! I can see my bone! Strange things are happening at the Paris Opera House. Le Coq Républicain is determined to pursue its investigation. -Are you afraid of me? -No. I'm cold. Your scent. Your female scent... flows in my veins like ocean waves. -Your scarf... -Take it, it's yours. -It's yours. -Yes. Christine, together we could do great things. Soon, the whole world will be at your feet. Our lives will be a joyful and happy celebration. Believe me. I believe you. -Trust me. - I trust you. My sweet darling. My love. -Did you get the tools? -Yes, I did. Give me the hammer. Listen. -What are you doing here? -You know what? No. What? - I saw him! -Who? The Phantom! Are you drunk, maybe? No. I saw him with my own eyes. Like I see you now. -Come on, enough! - I swear! I followed him. -It was something... -Something what? Great! -Great? Go on! -Yes. Not here, darling. Meet me after work. But one thing is for sure... your Alfred is a hero. Legend? It's not a legend, Mr. Journalist. Believe me. Ghost aren't real, here or elsewhere. I don't know about elsewhere. But here at the Opera House, I can assure you he's real. Want proof? I met him right here, in this box! -In this box? -Yes. It's undergoing a restoration and none of us likes coming here. And what does this Phantom look like? I haven't had the guts to look at him. Of course. It gets cold when he comes by. Really? They say he loves deepness, darkness, and that he's been living here underground since before the theater was built. Do you know this theater has four floors under the stage? Moreover, it seems down there there's life, a river and lakes! Don't you think it's very cold suddenly? Come on. Let's go. No phantom can scare your Alfred. Not one. I fought in the Versailles riot! Are you sure he didn't see you? Don't be silly. He can't have eyes in his back! I followed him like a leopard. His hideout is underneath. I walked through hundreds, thousands of tunnels. I went across passages heading to dark caverns. Shit. When I think of it... When you think of what? Thank God I left marks to come back, otherwise I'd still be there. Alfred, why did you take such a big risk? -There's treasure down there. A fortune. -A treasure”? A fortune? Are you serious? What else would you hide down there? Just think, my darling. If you marked the path, we can follow it again. It will be easy. A real treasure! -And it waits for us! We deserve it. -You bet. We deserve it. Right. We could live like royalty does! Alfred? What? Chocolate? And you? Excuse me. Who is that man who sketches all the time? Edgar Degas, the artist. He likes drawing dance school pupils. Others give them chocolate. Do you like it? -Good morning. -Milady. I should be very angry with you, Mr. de Chagny. What have I done that's so terrible? You know very well. On my honor, I swear I don't. My only crime is that I have met you. How can I put into words what I feel in my heart? Your flowers are wasted on me. I've never liked roses. You don't like roses? I prefer simpler flowers. However, the language you used in your letter... How can I say it? It's difficult to explain what I felt by reading it. For the first time in my life... I felt like someone could understand me. It was as if I'd just found a lost friend. I would like to be your friend. Will you allow it? Raoul... I'll allow you to be the brother I never had. And if we have to face the Phantom? I'll gut him, I promise. Paulette, how are we going to carry the treasure? We'll put it here! Alfred! -What's wrong? -I don't like walking behind you. Hey! Fine. Go first. -What does the Phantom look like? -I doubt he's really a phantom. -Isn't he? -No. Phantoms are like ghosts, wrapped in white sheets with holes for their eyes. He's dressed in total black, with a long leather cape. He's dressed like a real gentleman! -He's not scary, then. -No. Don't worry. I heard you're here to steal my treasure. No! I swear. It was Paulette. That bitch! I admire you a lot, Mr. Phantom. I'm not a phantom. I'm a rat. Oh, I'm sorry. I love animals. Alfred! Where are you? Answer me! Where are you?! No! The Phantom! -What's the matter? -The Phantom! The Phantom? What? Mr. Buquet! Frightening these poor girls, aren't you ashamed? I did it because they have to learn. Learn what? Not to trust the Phantom. Don't be ridiculous. You shouldn't drink like that. It was almost a year ago... when good old Gustave and his two workers... disappeared without a trace. Apparently, they went too deep underground. That's his world. No one ever comes back. He's hunting again. He's here in the theater! I saw him the other night. He was hiding behind some machinery. He was hanging over the stage... like a spider! What was he doing? He was listening to Christine singing. Everyone else had already left. She was alone on the stage, and sang like a nightingale. Do you remember, Milady? I remember. Your voice was wonderful, not like Carlotta's. She moos like a drunken cow, if I may say so. So you're the manager now. It's just a change in titles. All I want to do is manage this beautiful place in the same great way and with the same great skills you did. My skills didn't prevent you and your corrupt political friends from plotting to replace me just six months before my retirement! Come in. Pourdieu. Here comes another thief. -So you're pleased to see me. -You're a rogue! Come on, gentlemen, let's drink the champagne of the Republican brotherhood. Nicolaud! I've left you a present! What present? The Phantom! The Phantom of the Opera! -He's dying! -No, it's just a malaria episode. He'll be fine in a minute. He said something about a phantom. -What phantom? - I don't know. A sore throat. A nasty red sore throat. It's worsening as rapidly as anything I've ever seen. Until ten minutes ago I was fine. Cancel the performance. Maestro, maybe there's a solution. Why don't you try her substitute? She knows the role very well. -Substitute? Who is she? -Christine Daae. She's very good. She has been overcome with emotion. She's so young and inexperienced. It's because of Maestro Gounod. He's too impetuous. Take a breath, dear child. Deeper. Sniff it. Don't be scared. Good, this way. Now, all of you get out. Come on. I said, get out of here, please. So... It's nothing serious, but you should be quiet. -All right? Try and get some sleep. -Yes. I'll be visiting you tomorrow. The cold makes me shiver. You won't always be cold. -You must be very tired. - I sang for you. I gave you my soul, and I almost died of It. Angels cried tonight. Am I losing my mind? What you're trying to say about Christine, I can't understand, Jerome. Please. The word has spread. Jerome de Chagny's brother is in love with Christine Daae. Me in love? Funny! You laugh badly... and lie even worse. Look, I'm just her friend. Nothing more. Really? Then have fun with her. She's very charming, I agree, but... Don't look at me like that, little brother. This evening I'm taking you to a place for initiates only... where I hope you can cheer yourself up. Look at that. Satan's Litanies! You, the most knowing and beautiful among angels. Betrayed by fate, deprived of all praise. Have mercy on my long suffering! The Drunken Boat. Sweeter than the flesh of ripe apples to children, the green water penetrates my pinewood hull! -It arises ever stronger. -Without Rimbaud there would be no redemption in poetry, idiot! Baudelaire is the greatest, you degenerate fool! -Rimbaud! -Baudelaire! -Rimbaud! -Baudelaire! Rimbaud! Christine? -Is it you, Christine? -I'm not Christine. I'm Rose. Rose "Velvet Mouth." Vade retro, Satan a! Damn you! I hate you! -Raoul! -God will punish you! You disgust me! -What are you doing?! -You disgust me! Raoul! You're so pretty. Have another chocolate. I'll open it for you. It's Swiss chocolate. No! -It's from Geneva. - I don't want it. Help me! Stay away from me! Wait! What a spoiled child. Where are you? Darling? Where are you? Wait! Where are you? Wait! My little ballerina. The Big Bad Wolf is coming! I just want to give you some chocolate. I won't hurt you. I'm here! Where are you? You're so pretty! So nice! Be a good girl.. for me. Please, sweetheart. Be nice! Go home. Lightly. That's it. Stop. -Where have you been? -The Phantom ate Mr. Pourdieu! Of course he did! Tell us a better story. It's true. I saw him! You're a bad girl! You shouldn't lie. Thirty-eight! Yes! With my machine, we'll triple production. I swear it on my name. Revenge! I'll drag that beast from his lair and cut him to pieces! I didn't expect you so early, sweetheart. Why do you keep hiding that pipe? I know you smoke. I found that scented Dutch tobacco you like so much. Thank you. -Can I have some coffee and a donut? -With butter and jam? -And some honey, too. -Yes. -Okay? I'm so hungry. -Yes. I'll go. I'll go. Without knowing anything about love, is it possible to fall in love with two men at the same time? Christine! Come to me! -Come to me, Christine! -Yes. Sing, Christine. Sing for me. Oh, yes. Oh, yes. My love! Where are you from? I was abandoned at birth on the river of time and space. I was nourished and raised... by creatures who have become my friends, my brothers. This is the reason of my double nature, and I call this underground world my home. Medusa's ring will lead you to my kingdom. No idea. She disappeared three or four hours ago. -Disappeared? -Don't worry. She's just gone out. -Where could she be? -Perhaps at her singing lesson. Ah, yes, her singing lesson! Do you really think so? Love is too pure to be embraced by doubts such as yours. Please tell her I came by. Sure. Of course I'll tell her. Tonight you will sing. It's time to replace Carlotta. -There will be a surprise at the gala. -A surprise? Something to do with the law of gravity. The law of universal attraction. I have to go, but you stay here. I'll come back soon. -No, I don't want to be here alone. -Stay here! No. I'm coming, too. -Do as I say! Stay here! -I'm coming, too! No, I don't want to stay here! Where are you going? Wait! I hate you! I hate this place! My dear Carlotta, I am so excited! I have great news. Huge news! You can't even imagine it. It's a big deal! We're sold out! We had to turn people away. It's a victory! Incredible! Incredible? No, that's normal. Who is singing? Carlotta! -Of course, it's you. -Mr. Poligny, excuse me. Madame? Have you brought next season's contract? Yes, of course. Here it is. -Do you need it translated in Italian? -No need. Marc, go and get the costumes. I want to try them on. You will not sing Romeo and Juliet. -What? -Or I'll punish you. Got it, fat cow? How dare you address me like that?! Have you gone mad, Poligny? But I didn't say anything! You think I'm deaf? Is this French humor? Fuck off! You called me "fat cow!" -No, I didn't! -We'll discuss about my contract later! Get out, you lump of shit! I hope you spit blood. Get out! Carlotta! Carlotta! -Carlotta! -Marc? -Marc? -I'm here. Marc! -Carlotta! -Marc? Carlotta! COSTUME LABORATORY Even a puppet! Damn it! Marc! Where are you? Come out! THE PRODIGAL SON Juliette? Francoise? Hide! You won't sing tonight... if you care about your big boobs! Oh! Mama! ROMEO AND JULIET BY CHARLES GOUNOD CARLOTTAALTIERI AS JULIET -What happened? -Nothing. -Nothing? -Nothing, Mama! Did you fight over the new contract? I am Carlotta Altieri. And tonight, I will sing Juliet! I'll kill them all! Don't worry, it's a joke. Go in, please. Don't worry. Hey, you! Come here, please. Quickly. It's really good. May I, sir? What's the matter? Help! Help! Excuse us, coming through here! Help! Where is the manager's office? Thank you. Ten people dead and many injured. Some of them in bad condition. We received an anonymous letter, a threat letter handed over to Maestro Gounod. We thought it was a joke. Come to think of it, my predecessor said there was a curse on the Opera House. -Any news? -No. She can't have disappeared. You're always together. -You must know something. -I don't. Maybe someone else. -Who? Tell me. -I don't know. Someone who loves her-- maybe more than you. Come on. Come with me. Hurry up! You're going to sing! - I won't. -You will be Juliet. I said I won't. At the cost of how many lives? You'll sing Juliet, and I'll be there with you. - I hate you! -Yes. Love and hate are one. You'll get used to me and this life. Do you want that fool, that Raoul de Chagny? You deserve more. Much more. -No! -Yes! Oh, yes! Christine! My love! -Don't disappear like this again. -Don't ever let me do it again. This way. -How did you find this way? -Honorine found it. Behind the mirror. -Let's go, he can see us here. -Who? Who are you talking about? You can't understand. You're my light. But there's a deep darkness inside me. I'm not that innocent. You got it? No one is innocent. Look. Everyone has a dark side. Christine, don't be afraid of that. It's human nature. Believe me. Believe me. I'd like to see the sky. Come. Come. Christine, where is he? Is he real? Or does he only exist in that dark corner of your soul? Both. His will is my will. His thoughts are my actions. Raoul, I need help. I have no defense. Our love is your defense. Our love will deflect his thoughts. The stronger will be our love, the weaker he'll become. Soon, he'll be powerless. Trust me. Raoul, promise me you'll never let me go. Promise. Yes, my love, I will never leave you. I promise you. My little nightingale! Come, I knew she was here. Where have you been, dear? We were so worried! You can tell us about it one day. Let's go. -Maestro Gounod wants to talk to you now. -It's your debut night. -And Carlotta? -Poor thing. You can't imagine. It would take six months to tell it! -Raoul... -I promised, my love. I know her. -I know her. She's Christine Daae. -Oh, God! She and her innocent attitude! But she's the Phantom's whore! His whore! I saw her down there, in the basement of the Opera House! Sleeping with that horrible murderer! Both of them must die! Death to the monsters! -Christine! -Raoul, stop there! Stop him! Let me through. -Stop him! -Fantastic! -Sir... -Give that to me! -What happened? -No clue. I think it was the Phantom. Did you see it? He kidnapped my singer, we must get her back! Mine. Mine. You're mine! We will live alone in my dark world, until death do us part. Help, Raoul! Help me! I'm here! -Christine! -Where are you, Raoul? -Christine! -Raoul! -Help! -Raoul? Raoul? Forgive me. I'm sorry. Forgive me. Hurry! Follow me! Hurry! We have to catch him! This way! Oh, my God. - I feel sick. -Everything will be fine. I feel sick. No, Christine. We haven't time to rest. We're close. -Ah, the Baron with his gun! -Move away from her! Sure. Christine, life goes on. We can't stay here. They'll kill you if they catch you. They're here! Hurry! Hurry! We found them! Help her. Help her. What are you waiting for? -Help her. -No! -Let's take her away from here. -No! Hurry, they're running away! Raoul, get into the boat and take the oars. Christine, you must get into it, too. Quickly! They're down here, run! Sit down! -Follow the cave to the river. -No! Why?! Raoul, row! Faster! No! Stop it! Why?! My world is over and so am I. No! I won't! Go towards the light. Don't move! Get those two on the boat, too! No! No! Don't let them get away! No! Death to the monster! My love! My love! No! Christine! Don't leave me!
