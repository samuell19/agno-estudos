Yakuza Like a Dragon One item priced at 122 yen. One item priced at 98 yen. What are you eyeballing me for? I'm not looking at you... What, yakuza can't come to a convenience store? I didn't say that... What, something wrong with yakuza buying potato chips? I didn't say that, sir... Yes? Yes. Okay.)!- What, really? Yes, I understand. How much? Your total is 1,303 yen. 1,300... Make the receipt out to "Ue." I said hands behind your head, damn it! Don't move. Don't move. Hey! This is a bank, so why isn't there any money here? As I've been saying, I only followed the head office's orders. I don't get it! Why': there no money? I don't get it! Why's there no money? Just shoot him, Imanishi! You shoot. Hell no, what if it goes off? I don't want to either! Shoot him, Imanishi. Wait, I'm Imanishi. Shoot him! Shoot him if you're a man, Nakanishi! Shoot him if you're a man, Nakanishi! You do it! Shoot, Nakanishi! Shoot, Nakanishi! You promised! You said you would! I didn’t! Imanishi! I didn’t! Imanishi! Shoot! Shoot, Nakanishi! Imanishi! Imanishi! Nakanishi! Shoot, Imanishi! Imanishi! Shoot, Imanishi! Imanishi! Shoot, Nakanishi! Imanishi! Imanishi! Nakanishi! Make way! Make way! Clear out! Out of the way! Out of the way! Move! Kirameki Bank, Kamurocho Branch Mr. Date... What are you guys freaking doing, working so slowly in this damn heat? Section four isn't part of this. We know Kamurocho inside and out! Who are the suspects? It's two guys. They're calling themselves Imanishi and Nakanishi. What the hell? They a crappy stand-up act? Here you go. Apparently it's a modified weapon. They're gun maniacs. This heat is bringing out the crazies. How much money was at the bank? Well, that's the thing... What is it? Apparently most of it wasn't there. What, you just woke up or something? Excuse me please. I'm sorry. Make way. Thank you. Um, it's barley tea. Oh, thanks. Oh, thanks. Thank you. Excuse me, about the air conditioner... Can it go up more? Oh, it's old. That's the max. Huh? It broke. Shoot, Nakanishi! Shoot, Nakanishi! You shoot, Imanishi! Nakanishi! Nakanishi! Imanishi! Shoot! Ow, what the hell, Nakanishi? Ow, what the hell, Nakanishi? Shoot, Imanishi! You do it! Shoot! You do it! Shoot! Nakanishi! Are you serious... Wow... The hell was that... So nice and cool! Done? Yeah. Yeah. Me too! I'm starving. Let's get dinner. Let's go. Oh, before that, could we stop at Sancho Nante? Why? It looks like my watch battery is about to die... But you sell them here too. Ours don't last long. Then I guess we have to. Original Discount Store Sancho Name Doesn't that look good? Are you looking for something? Yeah. Die. Cheers, everyone! It's imported. Everyone, drink! He won't talk? Mr. Kazama from the Tojo clan asked me to. Hey, aren't you hot in that? Who is he? I was told not to ask. He wanted to keep him here for a while. Ow... It's dangerous. Run. What's that? No! You hurt? Please excuse us. I'm sorry about that. It's fine. So what were you looking for? Dog food. The temperature in Tokyo is now 88 degrees. The record high for the Kanto area's consecutive sultry nights keeps on changing. It's hot! It's getting hotter! The Tojo clan': 10 billion in the BF Kirameki Bank disappeared all of a sudden. What bank? What? I don't get these bank names lately. Mr. Majima, never mind the bank's name. What about the 10 billion? Why? You've never read the Nikkei Times? What's that? Nowadays, most IT firms have 30 billion like it's pocket change. Why are you widening your eyes over just 10 billion? It's a home run. You guys have got to read the Nikkei Times, got it? Yes, boss! Isn't there something more interesting going on? Okay, raise your hands. Raise your hands or die. Okay, you there. Apparently, Kazuma Kiryu, formerly of the Tojo clan, is out of jail. Really, Kiryu, huh? Seems he's linked to the missing 10 billion. Really? Where'd the info come from? It's a rumor. That's interesting. Thank you very much! And where's Kiryu now? Um... He should be somewhere... Man, you don't know? You're coming, right, guys? Yeah. We're going to go see Kiryu! Yes, boss! I'm in -Majima. Hey! Be right back - Majima I got this. Here. What is it? What the hell? Since the register was open. Since the register was open. But that doesn't mean you should've taken it. I'm going to go return this. Why? Gonna tell them, "I'm returning what I stole"? No... You'll get arrested. Well, I'm not the one who took it. You know, it hit me. What? It's pretty easy to steal money. Let's go on a stealing spree. Wait, why do you want to do that? Because it's so hot these days. Wait, that's not an excuse. We'll definitely get arrested. But I've got a weapon. Inside. Ow! I picked it up. You're worse than a yakuza. No no no, I can't do it. Fine. Then I'll do it alone. Hot.. Hot... Hot... It's too hot... It's so hot! Damn it... The gun's gonna slip out of my hand... That's why I said not to wear knitted masks! Stop blaming it all on me! You said to do this today! The day didn't matter! We shouldn't have worn knitted masks! Shut up, Imanishi! Shut up, Imanishi! It's hot! It's hot! Shut up! Shut up! Shut up! Shut up! You shut up! It's hot! It's hot! Quiet! It's so freaking hot! It's so freaking hot! Shut up! Shut up! I want the mask off! I see. I get it. You've got it rough. Thanks for the help. I'll treat you to dinner or something soon. See you. What went missing was part of the Tojo clan's funds. Was it transferred? Was it transferred? Beats me. 10 billion total. 10 billion total. 10 billion? It was split between a few different branches, and someone withdrew it all at once. Banks can get that much cash that fast? From the branches all over Tokyo, right? This small branch probably got hit hard and had to give most of its cash. Those two idiots filed in after the cash truck left. Hey, track down the truck. Seems it's missing. Missing? Yakuza stuff means it's section four': turn. Wait, Mr. Date! These idiots took over a bank with no money. What should we do? Isn't there something wrong with this? Beats me. I'm not section one. Thanks for the barley tea. Thanks for the barley tea. You're welcome. Hold on! Here, eat up. Is it good? I'm glad. Thank you, mister. Let's go. To where? What about the doggie? See you. What is it? Who the hell are you? What are you looking at? Mr. Owner, who the hell is he? He's Mr. Kazama': guest. I see. Is this supposed to be a thank you? It's delicious. Sekigyumaru Beef Bowl! Sekigyumaru Beef Bowl! Open it quick! Right! Hurry, Satoru! Hurry, Satoru! Yeah, I know! Idiot, don't say my name! Sorry. Okay, let's go! Hurry. This way, this way. Here? I can't see! That way... It's hot... It's hot... It's so hot... I told you it was hot. So hot... Hey, Yui... Is there something going on that you need money for? Barn! Ouch... Let's Let's W-what's going on? Kiryu... Kiryu... Kiryu... Has anyone seen Kiryu? Has anyone seen Kiryu? Kiryu... Where are you? Kiryu! Majima! Can't you walk normally like everybody else? Okay, daddy. With everyone here, there's gonna be lots of home runs today. Play ball! Roxy, how's it going? So-so, I guess. What about you, Maji? So-so. Mr. Majima! I'll follow you to your grave! Oh, it's Goro Majima. Want some? Who tried to have Kiryu killed at Sancho? That's 50,000 yen. Okay, that's 100,000 yen. Who was it? T-the Nishikiyama clan, most likely... Why? 200,000 yen. Okay, 200,000 yen. Why? I don't know... K-Kiryu is apparently dragging around a kid with him. She might know something. Do you know anything else? Thank you. You're not hurt, are you? Thank you very much. I'm gonna take a souvenir. You guys still going at it? Kiryu is going "Lone Wolf and Cub." Should stand out. Look for him. Yes, boss! Yes, boss! You shouldn't spit on the street. You're going to make this city dirty. Right? Right. Drink up. It's not my fault. He just followed me. Yo! Who are you? You're breaking my heart, Kiryu. Mr. Date? Do I look washed up or something? That incident 10 years ago got me into section four. My wife and kids left me too. Looks like you're doing well. Nice to see you again. When did you get out? Yesterday. The moment you got out of jail, this happened. What did you do? Nothing. The Tojo clan': 10 billion disappeared. I'm sure you heard. Yes. And you, an ex-Tojo clan member, got out. Every clan thinks you're connected to it. Talk. I'm just looking for this girl's mother. Her mother? She apparently works at one of the shops here in town. She doesn't know where she is though. What's your name? Haruka. I didn't ask you. What's your mother's name? I won't tell you. Information means life or death here, right? So I'm being extra careful. Man, don't corrupt her mind. You really don't know? If I knew, I'd tell you, Mr. Date. How's Mr. Kazama doing? What, you haven't seen him since getting out? I can't get a hold of him. How is he doing? I haven't heard his name lately. There's a heat-island effect. It's 3 degrees hotter than 10 years ago. Keep yourself hydrated! Drink up. It seems there's a heat-island effect. I think I'm going to be dehydrated soon. Your face has a rash? I'm allergic. You've got allergies? Excuse me... Excuse me! Please... Could we turn face up? It's hot! Don't shout! It's irritating! Your voice is irritating, Imanishi! You can turn face up! Reporting! All the hostages turned face up instead of face down! And? And what? And? Um, and... Is that it? Yes, sir... Could it be they're planning on shooting them one by one? Excuse me. Please let me through. Please. Please help yourself if you'd like one. No, I'm on duty right now. Reporting! A shooting on Pink Street! Possibly a shotgun. I don't care! Tell it to whoever': got jurisdiction! Why don't you all have some too? P-Please. Are you serious? Pawnshops make a lot of money, huh? Yes, we're a membership-only store. Let's go. Hurry, hurry. Let's go. Hurry, hurry. Wait, hold on! This is... What? This smells so good. I've tried it before at Isetan. Oh... Wait, we can buy that with this money. If we become wanted, we can't go to Isetan! Hey, old man. Hey, old man. This one! That one! Give me that one! That one, that one! Okay.)!- France is the best country for perfumes. Nobody! This way, this way! Hot... It's hot... It's hot... It's hot... It's hot... It's hot... Amazing... Smells so good! Here! Yeah. How much is there? Whoa, there's like 700,000. 700,000? 700,000? Yeah. Man, that's all, huh... What? Then how much did you want? Like 5 million or 10 million. Why so much? Let's go to the next one. Hey, Yui... Oh, yeah. Let's get a gun. I know a store that's rumored to be selling guns. We can buy one. Let's go. Hurry! So hot, so hot... Kiryu! What's that? Yeah, we don't know where Mr. Kazama went. I see. There's no way Mr. Kazama would go missing. 10 billion, huh... Apparently he was in an argument with the Tojo clan': board of directors. Though he's not the type to be taken down that easily... Was there a girl named Mizuki who used to come here? She's her mother. Yuya, when was the last time Mizuki came here? She was a regular? She was a regular? Yes. I think the last time was about a month ago. A month... She's looking for Mizuki. She can't get a hold of her. Mizuki put her in an orphanage, and she was working in this town. But no word since. Oh, since a few days ago, we've been letting him stay as a favor to Mr. Kazama. He said not to ask questions, so I didn't ask anything. It's delicious. I know you're busy, but could you collect some info? Of course. Oh, please use this. It's become more popular to have one. If anything happens, I'll contact you there. Just push here... I know how. Thanks. Not at all. Also, could you look after him? Sure. Wait here, okay? Watch your back. It's definitely Majima? These over-the-top things are his trademark. What did the store owner say? What did the store owner say? He won't talk. Then go back to the precinct already. This shop's a good point for info. If it's closed long, Majima will come running here. Can you guys beat him? Well... Okay, pull out! Pull out! That's a bad idea. Kiryu and Majima might butt heads. Kiryu? He's out? It's the battle of the Nishiki monsters. The defense force won't come save you! Pull out! Hurry up! Pull out! Pull out... Pull out... Sorry, out of the way. Jeez, move. What is it? It stinks! Old-man stench... It smells? You stink! What are you doing? Miss... Miss... It's so bad I want to punch you! What the hell is with you? I smell... This is... Yumi. My friend. How do you know Yumi? Mister, how do you know her? She's an old acquaintance. She's my mom's older sister. Where is she? She's working at a place called Serena. Say so sooner. It's because you didn't ask me... You... I'm not "you." I'm Haruka. Kim Ki-duk. "Receiver unknown" Your name? Park. You hungry? Alcohol will do. You're two days late. Something happened? Man, a troublesome one is in the mix... I know, right? Oh, my younger brother. He looks just like me, right? Would you like more beer? No, we're good now. Eat. It's probably better than Oukubo's. I came to Kamurocho, and I got some information. Mr. Kazama is missing... Did you go looking for him? loan'! find him. Lau Kalong in Yokohama didn't know either. So that's the result. I was set up. They aren't easy guys to handle. It's my first time here. It's interesting. If it's in place of pain killers, this will work better than makgeolli. Why did Seoul send you in? To kill Kyohei Jingu. What? Know him? The average Japanese don't know him. The Beast of Kamurocho. Could it be what everyone's been screaming about... The 10 billion? Jingu is moving under someone's command. On the outside, he acts like a politician, but he was collecting money working with the Tojo clan. Jingu was the one who pulled the 10 billion. What's he planning on doing with all that money? That I wasn't told. But Seoul is trying to stop this. That's why I am here. How can you do such a dangerous mission without knowing that? It's better than the Kim Tae-Jung incident. Won't be that bloody. Is Mr. Kazama safe? Won't know. AH I can do is pray. I was told to gather weapons on site. Where? North on Pink Street, there's a DVD shop called Beam. R's in the basement. They have weapons and info. Hey, are you okay? This way I can aim better. You an alcoholic? I messed up in the north... I did lots, including torture. Is Yumi dead? Then what about Mom? Why does everyone die? It's not fair. They all died before me... Scared of being alone? I'm not scared... You're just like Yumi. Haruka. If you're not sure they're dead, don't decide that they are. You want to see your mom, right? Then don't give up. Hello? Here he is. Hello? Is this Mr. Kiryu? Yeah. Yeah. It's Kazuki. That guy disappeared. I can't show my face to Mr. Kazama this way. Where are you right now? Um, the theater-front plaza. Is the shop on Pink Street still there? You mean Beam? It's a DVD shop now. Oh, if we go there... Let's meet up. I think asking him is the fastest way. Kiryu. Majima. Boom! Fm in - Majima I'm in - Majima Long time no see, Majima. I'm telling you in advance. I'm not interested in the 10 billion. That thing 10 years ago... That's right. We haven't settled it yet. You guys, stay back. Yes, boss. Stay back. We don't have time for... Oh, two youngsters I don't know. Good evening. You want something? Could I get a gun? How old are you? 21! You're 21? How cute. That's not true... Yeah! You know how to shoot? Tonight's a busy night. He's good... The legendary Kazuma Kiryu. Even our bro... Mr. Majima, please let it slide... Okay, let's continue. You trained in jail, huh? Right, Kiryu? Of course... You're gonna lose your arms next. I'm not gonna lose... I'm not gonna lose... I'm not... I'm... I'm not gonna lose... You want that? You're into this, huh? I need a gun stock and sight with this as the base. And a silencer. 2 cases of ammo. You'll need one more. You can speak it? Wrapped? I heard Jingu will appear tonight. Know where? Jingu, huh? Whenever he shows up, it's at Millennium Tower. There's a bar called Ares on the 66th floor. There's a woman there. How much for that info? R's free. If the Beast of Kamurocho disappears, then this country should get a little better. He goes by car? No. He goes directly by helicopter. Anywhere I could test this out? Anywhere, as long as it's the theater-front plaza. You can easily get on multi-tenant buildings' roofs. Try shooting signs. So which do you guys want? Well... Any, as long as it's amazing. Yeah, an amazing one. They're amateurs. It's heavy. Wow... Release the safety to shoot. 9 bullets go in the magazine. It's easy. What'd he say? That it's easy. Thank you. Here, the ammo. Say, what are you guys trying to do? Um, I don't really know. I just want money. Wait... Hey. There. Hey, Yui! Hello, Beam. Yeah, it's going so-so. Yes, it's a pair of young ones. They should be wandering around with a travel bag and a 9 mm auto. Yeah. But I don't think they know about the 10 billion. Yeah, about 20 years old? I took a picture, so I'll send it your way. It's these times, so just in case. It's good. It's delicious. It's definitely expensive. It's because you demanded the expensive ones. Thank you for the food. If they order anything pricier than that, I'm definitely going to snipe them. Excuse me, but would a few of you get off? Kill him and you'll hear it. We can't give him treatment like this. If he dies, it's your faults. What did you just say? You're gonna kill our bro? Just let me treat him! What are you doing? I'm back... Bro... Where are we now? We just left Kamurocho. Go back, moron. I can't be in a hospital at a fun time like this. Please lie down! Don't touch him! Don't ambulances run on people's taxes? Don't undermine the tax payers! Hey! Go back to Kamurocho. No, it's dangerous. What are you doing? Hey. I have a simple question. What is it? You need money, don't you? Everyone needs that. That's your bad habit. What is? You stir up stuff with people, but you freak out when it comes down to it. You stirred it up! Did I? Yeah! Where should we hit next? How would I know? I still don't have enough money! Hey, what the hell was that? What did you mean? It's them. There's no mistake. What is it? What, huh? Is it me? What the hell are you thinking? You stupid bitch! You stupid bitch! Don't come near me! Run. You can't do it. Oh, you gonna do it? Shoot Shoot, man. Come on, shoot! Stay back! A gun? He bought it here? Right. He had no money. Maybe he took a short-term job? I just sell it to them. Don't bother, Kazuki. He's never blabbed no matter what anyone did. He makes them mad so they'll hit him. He's an extreme masochist. Masochist? Masochists are this. So good... It's been a while, Mr. Kiryu. We're looking for two women. Their names are Mizuki and Yumi. I don't know a Mizuki. And Yumi? Oh, she used to work at Serena a while ago. We don't know where she's gone either. If something happened in this town and they have to hide, it's usually at Tougenkyo. Tougenkyo? What's that? It's a small bath place. Serena was broken into. Who do you think did it? Most likely the Nishikiyama group. The guys who struck at Sancho. The Nishikiyama clan... The Nishikiyama clan... Akira Nishikiyama': Nishikiyama clan. You used to hang out with him back in the day, right? The reason? Finding and asking Yumi might be the fastest answer. I heard you three are all out of the same orphanage. We don't know where Mr. Kazama ended up. Do you know anything? Hey, Stardust. It's best not to go after that Korean guy. He's Korean? Why not? For the good of Japan. Don't talk nonsense. I'm sorry I can't help. I... Don't worry about it. Go look for that guy. Right. Mr. Kiryu... Tomorrow, let's go drink, okay? Sure. Kazuki is cool. Don't fall for a host. They'll get you in the end. What was that about? What's going on? Who was that guy? I don't know. There's no way you don't. Hey, Yui! What are you hiding from me? Come on! Hey! What's the meaning of this? What are you doing? Stay back! Yui! Yui! Shut What's that? Can you shoot me? Take me lightly and I'll kill... What the hell are you doing? There's no way I'm going to have your kid. There's no way I'm going to have your kid... It's okay. I'm not having it... What the hell is that? I'm sorry... I only have 700,000... I borrowed a lot of money from him. In the beginning, it was just a little, but it grew to a ridiculous amount. Yui... I'm not having it. Satoru... I'm not. Yui? Yui! Yui!Yui! Yui... I shot again... What is this? I guess it doesn't hurt that much. Tougenkyo This is the bathhouse? That's right. You brought a child with you? No bath. I don't know her professional name, but we're looking for a girl named Yumi. Still... Please step into the lobby for now. This way, please. Get down! Kiryu. We see each other a lot. Bro... Where's Yumi? Why don't you look for her yourself? Guys, don't lay a hand on the kid. That's not something a human being does. Got it? Yes, boss! Kiryu... It's a doubleheader! Hey! Is Yumi here or not? Which is it? Haruka! Go check the second floor! No way! Go! I can't! I can't! It's okay! Majima isn't a guy who'd lie! Go! Time out. You're looking for your mom, right? I hope you find her. If you kill Mr. Kiryu, I'm going to kill you. That's not good... Okay, start shooting. This is your last chance. Is Yumi here? Kiryu... You're so cool... Haruka! Haruka! Haruka! You find her? You find her? She's not here. You looked everywhere? Kiryu... Are you ready to play hardball? Go. Go. Go. Go. Bro... Why don't we just end it here? No way. No way! Oh, it's Kiryu! Kiryu... It was fun. Man... Who is it? Mr. Kazama... Mister! The Nishikiyama group was holding him captive. I brought him here. Kazuma, her mother is at Ares in Millennium Tower. And the 10 billion that disappeared is there too. Seems Mizuki stole the 10 billion that Jingu and the Tojo clan gathered. Why is that? Something between a man and a woman, but I don't know details. It's trouble, Kiryu. Apparently Nishiki is after that 10 billion. Go. Kiryu. You'd better not die. Haruka. You're not scared? I'm okay, as long as I'm with you. Are you going to make it? Yeah, I'll be fine. Are you sure? Yeah. Okay.)!- Then let's get to the hospital. Don't... They'll catch us. Thanks. If you don't stitch up that wound, it'll open right up. A girl was kidnapped. There's no time to stitch it up. Man, the yakuza world isn't easy, huh? I'm glad I'm a pharmacist. Men who fight should drink this! Revives physical strength to the max! Maintain heat status Staminan X Staminan XX Staminan Spark It's going to spill! What's that? What? Is it backup? No, I didn't hear anything. Mister! Nishiki. I'm going to stand at the top of the Tojo clan in my own way. I want to let Haruka see her mother. That's it. You can't in that condition. Mister! Mister!

Fm in - Majima Did I catch a cold? Haruka... Hey, Haruka! Haruka! Haruka! Are you okay? Haruka! Haruka! Haruka! Haruka! Mizuki... Yumi is dead. You're still alive. Can you stand? Yeah. Mister...
