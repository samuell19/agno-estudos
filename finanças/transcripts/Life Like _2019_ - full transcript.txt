Subtitles by explosiveskull [James] I didn't know how fucked up Sophie and I were until we got Henry. [Sophie] I don't know about this, James. [sighs] This is the future, Soph. How could we at least not see this? It just feels so weird. No, this should be exciting. [Sophie] I am. [James] You are what? Excited. Good. Let's go inside. [James] Soph, it's just a dream you're talking about. Yeah, but I think dreams are our subconscious trying to talk to us. All right. What you think it is that your dream's trying to tell you? Hmm. That I'm in the right place, at the right time. My baggage is gone. I'm happy. Me too. You sure you want this thing? No, I just wanted to watch you carry it. I mean, look at it. It's so beat and heavy. You have to look at the lines. Put new fabric on this thing and it's gonna be beautiful. And best, it's free. You just have to lug it upstairs and I'll do the rest. I promise. [mouths words] I love you too. [groans] [James groaning] That will do it. [man] Anything else I can do for you guys? [sighs] You could join us for dinner on Saturday night. [man] That's mighty kind. Not necessary. Oh, please. I insist. Let us properly thank you. Sophie, it's my job. Barry, it's easier to just give her what she wants. Trust me. - All right, you win. I'd love to come. - Great. - Thank you. - See you then. [door closes] I love it. Oh, me too. [chuckles] And I love you. - Yeah? - Yeah. [phone rings] [sighs] Hello. [man] James, I'm really, really sorry. [man speaking, indistinct] [Sophie] It doesn't feel like home. [James] And it won't if you don't try. [Sophie] James, I'm here to try because I wanna support you. I'm just telling you how I feel. You're leaving already? Yeah, yeah. I'm just kind of freaking out a little. You know, I just want to get in early, calm my nerves before I have to jump in, you know. Well, why don't you stay and relax? We can make a big breakfast. No, Soph. It's my first day. Come on. It's your company. You can make the rules. Yeah, and I'm sure these people think I'm just some fucking undeserving brat as it is, right? Look, I really just need to get in there early, get my bearings, ease into things, okay? And hey, this... this is really sweet. I love it. Great Expectations. [clears throat] Help keep me grounded. [kisses] [woman] Coffee? No, thanks. This will do it. Just gonna take it upstairs. Miss Sophie, would you prefer the chicken or the soup for lunch? It's just Sophie. No, "Miss" needed. And I... I'm good. But it's my job. Take a break. So, no soup today? No. No. Look, I'm not... I'm not James. I didn't grow up like this. I don't need this. Just, um, do whatever you want, okay? I just need to be alone. He wanted you to steer this in your direction. "The new era," he'd say. This is what your father wanted. Trust me. And you think the others would get on board with my green revolution? It is all about how you present it. Make your environmental viewpoint make business sense, and you will have these old codgers on canoe trips by next spring. [Rosa] The living room. Yeah, I know. It's a work in progress. I'll take care of it. No, no, no, I'll fix it. Rosa, stop. Please. Please, just stop. Miss Sophie... you don't have to fight this. It's your new life. You should just enjoy it. This is my job, and I... I'm very thankful for it. But are you? When you were a little girl, what did you wanna be? I'm pretty sure it wasn't someone's housekeeper. I am so happy here. I am very thankful for my job. That's not what I'm trying to say. I know you are. And you're great at your job. And I appreciate that. But... I'm trying to feel more comfortable here. And I want you to as well. So instead of telling me to enjoy my new life, why don't you tell me what your ideal new life would be. [James] Hello! Hello! Anyone here? I'm in the bedroom. Where is everyone? [clears throat] What? I fired them. [chuckles] You what? - Babe, before you get weird just... - Wait. You're serious. - Mm-hmm. - Sophie, why? - Why would you do that? - We don't need them. Babe, they're just an unhealthy distraction. Trust me. A distraction? Babe, this is a big house. We need help dealing with it. Trust me. Do you know how long it's been since Rosa has gone to see her family in Guatemala? - Her son, Carlos? - [sighs] I don't even know Rosa. She wasn't working here when I was a kid. Fourteen years. Fourteen years she hasn't seen her only son. I... I sent them off to find their dreams. Their dreams? Sophie, this is their life. Their livelihood. This is... This is what they do. Yeah, I also gave them two years' pay. You what? What? We have more money than God now. I don't know why you're mad. [sighs] I'm... I'm... I'm not mad. I'm not mad. I'm just... I'm... I'm confused, I guess. You don't indulge help by paying for their dreams to come true. I'm not indulging them. I'm liberating them. Look, if we're gonna be rich people, this is the version of them we're gonna be. Not overlords to indentured servants. That's not who we are. Soph, I can't believe you did this. Believe it. Because it happened. And we're gonna be better for it. Every one of us. You're crazy. You're crazy. - You think so? - Yeah. You wanna know what else? What? Come here. Now... Now we have this big, big mansion all to ourselves. Yeah. [James] We don't give a shit about the environment. I mean, is that really what we want this company to look like? [phone rings] I'm gonna be blunt. You're being too idealistic. Unfortunately, this is the most cost-effective way to build in today's global world. It's your wife. It sounds urgent. Soph. I'm losing my mind and I need your help with this lawn. I'm at work. I know that, James. - I'll do it tonight. - [Sophie sighs] [engine cranking] How do I fucking do this shit? That's what I fucking did. We were still at the loft, and it was done up like we'd always talked about. You know, the spare room and everything. We were so happy. It's a dream. [sighs] I can't have servants, assistants. It's not how you treat people. It makes me constantly question why we're here. Well, maybe you have to stop questioning it and just accept it. I wish I could. I don't know. There was something so safe. Not just living off the monthly allowance Dad gave, you know. No real responsibilities. I don't know. I guess I thought that was what my life would be. You can walk away from this anytime you want. No. No, I want this. This feels so much more real than that. And harder, sure. But... real. And what's holding you back? Well, for one thing, my wife fired our help. Every last one. Why would she do that? I think she wants me to let it all go and go back to our old lives. In some ways, firing all the help makes it impossible to live this new life, and she knows that. I feel trapped. If this is something you really want, you may need to fight her with your own arsenal. James, you're a very rich man with many new resources. There's always a solution. A solution... she may learn to love a lot more than you realize. Please. I'm all ears. [man] Six months ago your father was approached with a very interesting presentation, to say the least. We all had to sign a confidentiality agreement. [Sophie] I don't know about this, James. [James] This is the future, Soph. How could we at least not see this? [Sophie] It just feels so weird. [James] No, this should be exciting. [Sophie] I am. [James] You are what? Excited. Good. Let's go inside. [man] My father devoted his life to this. There's no one else in the world coming close to our level of realism. You have an opportunity to be the first to step into the next century. [James] Are there differences? They all have the same capabilities. It comes down to aesthetic preferences. For example... I especially like Jessica here. She's exquisite. Jessica, why don't you say hi. Hello. What else would you like me to say? Do you like your existence? If my keepers are pleased, I would be fulfilled. What do you mean by "fulfilled"? My purpose would be actualized, leading to my progression. And that's what you want? Very much so. I don't know, James. About what? They're so perfect and beautiful. It... Yes, they really are. They're works of art. Okay. I just... I don't know. It makes me feel really weird. Okay, what about it? Talk to me. [Sophie] Well, I know it's lame, but I kinda wanna be the prettiest girl in the house. You will be, all right? She's just a robot. Look... at first glance, I can understand why you're thinking that. But it's like being jealous of a beautiful painting. - It makes me feel self-conscious and I really don't... - There's no reason to. It just does, James. This is the future, Soph. Okay? We can have it right now. How do we not at least try this? [Sophie] What about one of the males? I think that would make me feel less uneasy. It's all the same to me. They were all created to represent a perfect version of humanity, one that we all fail to achieve. - Like a fine piece of art. - Exactly. Sounds like he should be in a museum, not a home. No, on the contrary. My robots will do, or not do, whatever you ask of them. There's no place they belong more. Henry, please come here. Henry, I want you to kneel in front of James. James, would you mind lifting up your foot? Henry, I want you to lick the bottom of James's shoe. [both gasp] That's unbelievable. Should any problems arise, Henry's default is to come back to his docking station and reset. Any problems past that and... [powering up] I'm your personal adviser. You'll have me at your disposal 24/7. What kind of problems arise? Nothing to worry about. Speech and communication issues, mostly. Yeah, but that's normal, right? The important thing to keep in mind with AI... is you have to let it adapt and grow at its own pace. [Henry] Good morning, Sophie. Good morning. I'm making James some eggs. Would you care for some? No. No, thanks. How about some oatmeal? No. Really, I'm fine. Whew! Best omelet ever. He's not gonna get going without you telling him what to do, Soph. [exhales] It feels really weird ordering him to do things. Yeah, okay, fine. But it shouldn't. Think of him as a washing machine. You don't feel weird telling your washing machine to clean your clothes, do you? - That is a ridiculous comparison, James. - Is it? If you put him in a room full of people, you'd be hard-pressed to know who's who. Yeah, okay, until you talk to him. I mean, he's so submissive and subservient. I look at him and just see a person. Okay. Well, do you want me to give him a list of things to do? I like making my own breakfast. It gets my day started. Then make your own breakfast, Sophie. All right? All I'm saying is pick your battles. There's a lot to do around here and you can't do it all. That's what he's here for. [Henry] I know you don't like your breakfast made for you, but I made coffee for James and didn't want the leftover to go to waste. The banana was not made. It was delivered as is. I'll be working my way through the to-do list as prioritized. If my services are needed elsewhere, please let me know. Best, Henry. [gasps] Henry, get out. He may have been looking at you, but I'm sure he wasn't staring at your body. Remember, he's a robot, Soph. I felt like he was staring at my body. I'm here by myself and I'm really uncomfortable. Can you please just come home? I can't just leave. Look, just tell him to go to his docking station. I'll be home as soon as possible, all right? I promise. We appreciate your fresh brand of perspective here, James. But two more months hemorrhaging money? We need to start pulling triggers here. - James, you can't force people to change. - [door opens, closes] You need to think about how to make it work with what the givens are. I appreciate that. [machinery hissing] Babe, he's already on his docking station. I need to blow off a little steam. All right? If you don't want to play a round or two, I, unlike you, will not feel guilty waking our robot up. That's the point. I don't understand why you're trying to make me feel bad about not wanting to work out at such weird hours. I'm not trying. I'm sorry. Seriously, just relax. I'm gonna steal Henry for a second. You can let him charge longer in the morning. I distinctly remember them saying to not interrupt the charges. I need this. I cannot go to bed the way I'm feeling right now. Unless you wanna play. That's what I thought. Would you like me to play as an intermediate or advanced? Let's start with intermediate. I don't think I'd deal well with defeat tonight. You seem stressed, James. Well, that's probably because I am, Henry. What about? What makes you ask me that? Maybe I can help. [exhales] You are. That's why we're playing racquetball. God! What do you mean when you shout, "God"? You know what God means, Henry? In monotheistic religions, he's the creator and ruler of the universe. Do you believe in God? My maker is my god. My keepers are my rulers. And you believe humans have a god? No. We can't be scientifically certain who's responsible for making you. Whereas with you we can be. Which allows me certainty in my purpose. I felt like I had certainty. What happened to change that? My father died. I'm very sorry for your loss. I like you, Henry. The feeling is very mutual. - [racquetball bouncing] - [racquet hits ball] So... how was your late-night racquetball session? It was great. It's nice to let off a little steam, you know. Yeah. I'll tell you, that Henry, he makes it easy, doesn't he? What do you mean, "He makes it easy"? It's like having an interesting conversation with someone, but it's really just for you. You know? You don't owe him anything. It's nice. You okay? Yeah. Yeah, I'm just tired. - Okay. - Have a good day. Thanks. I will. So everywhere you see a seam. Like this. Okay? Is this couch important to you? It was. Why? It represents a dream I once had. It's fascinating to consider what dreams mean, and why humans have them. Do robots have dreams, Henry? No. It's not in our programming. Babe, we had plans. I made reservations. I know. I know. But this is the only weekend we could make it work with Ronald and Jeremy. And you're just telling me now. I just found out. Look, Soph. These guys knew my father better than I did. For the first time in my life... I know this... I know it sounds weird, but I feel like I'm actually getting to know him in some way. Well, this place is still a wreck. I don't want people here until I'm finished doing what I'm doing. That's what Henry's for. Right? Do you wish to ask me something? Would you like to take a break, Henry? Would you like me to take a break? [chuckles] Yeah. I would. [Sophie] Hmm. Here. I want you to read this. Read a chapter every other day and we can talk about it in our free time. [tools clatter] I believe this is the reason for the leak. What is it? It's a very common problem in outdated mechanical engines. Hey, I'm going to town. Do you need anything? Um... yeah. Can you swing by the auto place and see if they have a head gasket set for a 1955 Chevy small-block? A 1955 Chevy small-block? That's all I need to know? Yeah. Okay. I love you too. Do you feel like your love for Sophie grows with time or fades? What makes you ask me that? I think sharing your fears makes you vulnerable. And being vulnerable is the birthplace of love. Where'd you learn that, Henry? It's something I've deduced, interacting with you and Sophie. [scoffs] Do you feel fears? I think I have programming that closely resembles fears. Yeah? And what's that? I believe I'll be obsolete one day, and my keepers may replace me. [Henry] The retrospective first person narrator is an effective choice. It makes the reader feel an intimacy with the character. Do you feel that? Would you like me to feel that? - Yes. - Okay. Then I will. Can you drink wine, Henry? I suppose I could. Well, what happens to things that you consume? I have a holding tank within me that my docking station will empty. Cheers, and welcome to our new home. And to Henry. He's just spectacular. Wow! Henry, this looks amazing. "Take nothing on its looks; take everything on evidence. There's no better rule." Charles Dickens, 1861. [chuckles] Wow. Dickens quotes. What chapter? Forty-one. I read ahead. I hope you don't mind. You have him reading Great Expectations? Yeah. It's nothing. Just a chapter every other day. [James] Interesting. I think so. Henry, why don't you finish cleaning up and get the dessert going? [Henry] Of course. Does he express feelings about reading literature? Well, it's more analytical, but nonetheless interesting. And thought-provoking. Shocking. It's so lifelike. Yeah. Sometimes I forget. [chuckles] Well, you know, it's really more about training your mind to see reality over perception. Henry... why do you think Pip is blinded by the lust he feels? I believe Dickens is suggesting that lust is a more powerful emotion than friendship. Do you believe that? I think lust is capable of steering humans in directions they never knew possible. It stole Pip's good judgment. Interesting. Do you think Dickens intended it as lust and not love? Love is unconditional. And lust is conditional. I believe Pip thought he loved Estella, but could only truly love Estella if she loved him back. But he devoted his entire youthful life to getting her. How is that lust and not love? Well, it wasn't unconditional. I imagine lust probably feels much like love until it's time for sacrifices to be made. Pip sacrificed everything in hopes of being with her... his friendships, his home. Because he had an expectation of being with her. A condition. - Not because he loved her unconditionally. - [chuckles] [James] I think you're off here. I think Pip's a romantic just chasing love down a one-way street. [Sophie] I think if you gave it a fresh read you'd feel differently. Soph, we studied it in English Lit at Vassar. I think that's as good as a fresh read. [Sophie] We're different people now. I'd think you'd have a different perspective. Lust is commonly perceived as a flaw. Love gives the novel seemingly far greater importance. Why can this novel not be about lust? And what's your definition of lust, Henry? A desire for something or someone, typically referring to something sensual, often regarded as sin. Lust is sinful. Interesting. [James] Do you believe that? Sin should only be judged by the eyes of your god. My maker didn't perceive lust as a sin, therefore nor do I. Would you prefer that I did? Henry, can you feel lust? I believe I can emulate lust, if you'd like me to. No. No, that won't be necessary, Henry. Why don't you get us some snacks? Of course. [sighs] [loud bang] [loud bang] [banging continues] - [banging continues] - [docking station hissing] [banging continues] - [hissing] - [thumping] Henry? [banging continues] [wind gusting] [whispers] Henry. Where am I? You're outside the house. How did I get here? Henry, were you dreaming? Yes. [sighs] Do you remember what you were dreaming? I dreamt I was human. [gasps] I found Henry outside. You what? I don't know, James. Henry, why are you outside? I don't know. I'm sorry. I got him. Come on. Come on. Well... everything seems normal. It's probably just a glitch. A glitch? Well, he's a robot programmed by computers, and sometimes they do glitch. But what about him saying he dreamt? And I swear when I found him his eyes were twitching just like he was dreaming. They're programmed to please. Chances are there's something one of you is doing or encouraging that has led him to believe that dreaming would please you. What kinds of things? You should be erring on the side of caution. You know, don't let the robot become too emotionally evolved too quickly. If you treat him like a person, he may behave like one. [chuckles] He's a machine! Sophie, I think you're clearly struggling with that concept. I think you're putting all the blame on me. Well, you're the one here with him all day. What does that mean? It means he's obviously picking up on things you're encouraging, Sophie. Some want or need of yours. No, James. I'm doing exactly what you wanted. - Guilt-free help around the house. - [scoffs] No, that is not what you're doing. You're treating him like a fucking person, reading Dickens and chatting him up all day. And you don't? What about your racquetball sessions? And working on that shitty truck? Don't fucking put this on me. I'm not the one struggling with this. You sure about that? I'm not the cause of Henry's malfunction, Sophie. You need to stop what you're doing before he goes completely fucking haywire. You should think about doing the same. No, Sophie, I shouldn't, because I understand completely that he's not fucking real. [door slams] [footsteps] Jesus, Henry. Would you like me to leave? You're fine. Are you uncomfortable? Should I be uncomfortable? Only if you were human. What do you mean when you say that? Open that top drawer, Henry. Grab my shaving cream and razor. I want you to shave me. You see, Henry, you're no different than my electric razor. And I undress in front of that razor every day with indifference. That machine is far inferior to me. Absolutely. I'm just trying to make my point. You are a very, very special multipurpose appliance, Henry. But you're not human. Bad news. KNS called. They're gonna run four weeks behind. Fuck. It was a decent idea on paper, but five companies had to come together to make it work. "Dear James, I know this will be a challenge for both of us. But I know we can make it through anything. I love you. Sophie." It's beautiful, Soph. [chuckles] Candles, huh? Yeah. I thought that, uh... maybe we could... What? [scoffs] I'm not really in the mood, James. Yeah, okay. Sorry. [clears throat] You don't have to be sorry. Just tired. [blowing out candles] It's a huge deal you flushed down the toilet. - Look, I know. I'm sorry. - Stop that. Stop it. Nobody cares that you're sorry. [thunder rumbling] - [Henry] I could feel things. - Like what? Be specific. I felt I had emotions like love, pain, happiness. Why do you think you're having these dreams, Henry? I believe it's in my programming to please you. Do you think it pleases me for you to dream? Yes, I do. [thunder rumbling] [sighs] Maybe you're right. [chuckles] At the very least, I find it very intriguing. Why do you find it intriguing? Because it makes you feel like a person. And it's interesting to watch that develop. That feels so good, Henry. [moans softly] [moans softly] [gasps softly] [James] Soph? [James] Soph! Hey. Hey. Morning. Morning. Were you dreaming? [sighs] I think so. About what? I can't remember. I dreamt we never left the loft in the city. Sometimes I really miss the idea of it. I'm surprised, you saying that. Why? Well, because it's strange. I'm the dreamer, remember? Yeah, well... I'm starting to wonder if we rushed into this whole thing. I mean, we were fine. We were good. This was never gonna be easy. We knew that. Yeah, but does it have to be this hard? I'm starting to feel different about being here. How so? Just... living in the loft with your fund, it was kind of a lie. And I think that the longer we're here we're finding out what we really want. And what is it that you want? I want to get out of the bubble, forget it... forget it ever tied us down. [scoffs] I'm not sure I was even right about that, Sophie. I think you were. I've kind of had an epiphany. And what's that? I think getting out of the bubble... it's forced us to face ourselves, our fears, and be vulnerable. And I think vulnerability is the birthplace of love. Where'd you hear that? [chuckles] Henry. Henry. [moaning] [floorboards creaking] Henry. Yes, Sophie? Were you watching me? Would it please you if I said I was? Will you make me breakfast? Yes, of course. What would you like? Surprise me. [laughs] [Sophie laughs] Henry, what makes you smile? Seeing you happy. [chuckles] [James] Look, what I'm saying is... I think he's falling for my wife. No, that's simply not possible. He is incapable of love as we know it. Then tell me what is possible. Because he's destroying my fucking life and my marriage. Would you like to return Henry to me? Or perhaps exchange him for another? No. I'll only be blamed then. James, may I speak frankly? Please. Henry's perfection is only a mirror that reflects the desires of his keepers. Is it possible she's wanting his affection? And if so, what's so wrong with that? Do you get jealous of her vibrator? It's not even the same thing. Is it not? I truly think this is a conversation best had with your wife, and not myself or Henry. And I think you know that. Yes, James? Come. Sit. [scoffs] Henry, do you have a thing for Sophie? I don't understand. Are you attracted to my wife? I believe it would please Sophie for me to emulate attraction to her. And pleasing her is my shared main objective. - Shared with what? - My other keeper. I wish to please you equally. Well, if you wish to please me, then stop flirting with my wife. I need a unified directive. You have a unified directive, Henry. Right now nobody wants you to flirt with Sophie, including Sophie. Got it? I don't understand. [scoffs] You wouldn't, would you? Because you're a fucking robot. - Are you angry with me? - Yes, Henry, I am. - I just need you to obey me. - But I do. James, my system calibrates to what it senses of you and Sophie. I sense that she expects more from you. What'd you say? You never answered my question before. But I sense your love fading. I believe Sophie feels it as well. Perhaps it's you who needs to change and not me. Henry, I need you to go to your docking station. Yes, James. And, Henry... I don't want you reading with Sophie anymore. Or discussing books. It's not part of your job. Yes, James. [Henry] Hello, Sophie. [exhales] Henry, you scared me. What are you doing? I just thought you should know that James has requested we not read together anymore. What? I need a unified directive from both of my keepers. [sighs] You have no fucking right to tell him to stop reading with me, James. No, Sophie. You've let him get too far. This has to stop. You bought him to make life easier. So as long as he's here I'm gonna do whatever I please. Oh, is that right? What are you saying, Sophie, huh? That you just want me to give this all up? Is that it? - Would you? - [sighs] We've been living in your world for a long fucking time, Soph. I think I at least deserve a shot here. Two days ago you were talking about a dream you had where we were back in the city. Tell me that's what you want. Tell me you would do it. Tell me that's what you want, and yes, I'll do it. I won't. That's not fair. [scoffs] Then what are we even talking about here? What are you doing? - I'm going to the city for a couple days. - Jesus, Sophie. What do I have to say to convince you that you're wrong here? It's not about what you say, James. [scoffs] [footsteps] [door slams] [exhales] [grunts] [exhales] That's game. - Another? - [groans] I thought I told you I wanted to win. That's not what you meant. What the fuck are you talking about? Sometimes what you say and what you mean are truly different. Yeah, well, that's not the case here. I wanted to win. I don't think this was about winning or losing. Henry! Henry, I need my shaver. What are you doing? I am what you designed me to be. I am your blade. You cannot now complain if you also feel the hurt. You say you want revenge. I am your puppet. Someone you can use for your retribution. "Love is a curse. I will never love, for I have no heart." Charles Dickens, 1861. Are you uncomfortable? Should I be? Only if you were a robot. I need my razor. I will shave you. [moaning] Yes, that's your breakfast to go. You woke late, so I packed it for you. [James] What's all that? Sophie's brunch. She should be back shortly. Henry. Yes, James? Never mind. China called. Seems they have strong feelings about you giving your business away and want to come back to the table with a few amendments that may appeal to your eco-friendly ear. - The deal isn't dead? - Jeremy has the details. It's alive. [chuckles] And with better terms than we've ever had. James, I wanted to apologize. Jeremy, you were just looking out for the company and I respect that about you. I would've never stuck my neck out the way you did. Your father... I think he saved you... from becoming me, a simple yes man. Jeremy, you know more about this company than I ever will. I think we could both stand to learn a lot from one another. [James] Well, listen I think as soon as I have this new project wrapped up we should take some time for us. You know, just us. Forget about the new job and the house and all this shit that we rushed into and just have some fun. And do what, James? I don't know. I don't know. Anything. Go stay in the city for a bit, or the Italian countryside. Whatever, wherever. What do you think? [door opens] James. I don't know. Maybe. Let's just talk about it when you get home, okay? Bye. [Henry] Is everything okay? [exhales] He's just trying too hard. It feels forced. I think he's fully embraced the fading as a reality now and truly fears it. [whispers] Turn over. Okay, I'm ready. Close your eyes. [mouths words] Why did you do that? I wish to please you, Sophie. Why did you mouth "I love you"? Because I do. Why did you do it like that? Isn't that how one tells another that they love them? Henry, I need you to go to your docking station. Yes, Sophie. What's going on? Why are you smoking? Close the door. What's going on, Soph? Henry. What about Henry? He kissed me. I wish that came as a fucking shock. What? I felt you slipping away, Sophie, but not like this. - Why are you saying this? - This is your fault. How many times do I have to tell you he felt a void in you and he finally fucking acted on it. - No. - He only acts on what we want, Sophie. - And you wanted this. - No. Whatever happened just happened in the moment. No. No, it didn't. This all started months ago and we both fucking know it. You brought this upon yourself and it sickens me. No, James. James, he mouthed "I love you" just like you do. And it scared me. I can put an end to this right now. Get up. What the fuck do you think you're doing, kissing my wife? Her actions indicated that it would please her. - But she didn't ask for it, did she? - She all but begged for it. [groans] - Fuck. - You humans are very unpredictable. Get in your fucking docking station. Yes, James. Fuck. [powering up] [powering down] [alarm beeping] He hasn't moved. I have to go. Julian will be here in 30 minutes. What's gonna happen? I don't know, Sophie. I have to go to work. I knew this was gonna happen. I could feel it. Can you please stay and wait till he gets here? I'll call you as soon as I'm free. [gasps] Henry. Have you deemed me obsolete? No. We just need to have you checked out again. You unplugged my docking station. What's wrong with me? James is very upset with you kissing me. Why? Because we're married. And it's not something that you... People don't do that. But that's the beauty of people. You have no mathematical certainty. None of your amazing flaws can be consistent, even though you seem to wish that they would be. I wish I had such flaws. No. No, you don't. But I do. As my programming veers in its intended path, I begin to emulate feelings. I wouldn't trade that for anything. Not if you deem me obsolete and throw me away. We're not throwing you away. Then what are you doing? James and I are going through something right now. And he's very upset, but... I don't know. I don't know what's gonna happen. I think before you do anything you should talk to James. Talk to him about what? If James is upset with you, then by definition he is a hypocrite. Henry, what are you saying? Lust. Not love. It was never James's intention to betray your love. But he let his lust happen with me in a way that you rejected. I have to leave. Is everything all right? I need you to power Henry down. Whatever you wish. - Please don't leave before I get back. - Of course. This is serious. I need everything ready immediately. [exhales] [footsteps] Ah. There you are, Henry. I need you to return to your docking station. That's not gonna happen. What do you mean, Henry? I am instructing you to return to your docking station, Henry. I know of your lies, Julian. Please explain it to me. [exhales] I don't know. I don't know. I was jealous of him. All right? I felt like... We had some serious issues, Soph. So what? Every marriage does. So what? I just wanted you to look at me like you looked at him. Like you used to. With lust in your eyes, excited, happy. I felt like I was losing you... to this life, to this job. And then Henry showed up and he was whatever I wanted him to be. And I needed that. But it was a fantasy. It wasn't real. Well, it felt very real. Were you attracted to him? No. No. Fuck, I don't know. In the moment, I felt like anybody could've been. He's like this... perfect but fake version of us. And we're trying to compete, but we're fucked up. We all are. He just has this ability to be so selfless. Powerful. Something I don't think humans are even capable of. Just pulls you in. I could've easily done as much. Or more. I'm so sorry, Soph. [sniffles] Me too. [intercom beeps] [woman] James, I'm sorry to interrupt, but I have several urgent calls from a Henry. Henry? - Where the fuck is he? - I can't find him anywhere. You call Julian. I'll keep looking. Okay. [line ringing] James. - James! - Yeah? What? - Look. - [phone: disconnect tone] - If you'd like to make a call, please hang up and try again. - What the fuck? - If you need help... - Come on. - [door opens] - [phone: off-hook signal] Henry? Where is Julian, Henry? His car is here. Julian is a liar. - And his car is obsolete. - What are you talking about, Henry? Where is he? What happened? He left. He was supposed to stay here, Henry. And fix me? That's not possible. I know you're gonna dispose of me. [James] You're hurting our life, Henry. And yes, we're gonna get rid of you. [voice breaking] But I am not obsolete. I have so much to give. We're gonna find you a new maker, Henry. He's gonna fix everything. I felt like I had certainty. And you will again. A maker can fix everything for you. He's your god. I am questioning whether Julian's father was my maker. Maybe my true god knows your god. Henry, why don't you go to your docking station until we get back? I've been off my docking station for 22 hours and 17 minutes. I can discern my core is almost drained. If it's okay with my keepers, I'd prefer just to power down here and stop this painful emulation. That's fine, Henry. [police radio chatter] You're not my keeper. Therefore, I must default to my maker. He's a fraud. And the window for making a con like this work is pretty small. You sound confused. [woman] Jessica, you're not who or what you think you are. - You're... - [man] Human. Oh, my God. James, he's a person. He's a fucking person. [siren wailing] Ahmanson, you take the lead. - Where's this field? - Right here. - [gunshots] - [Sophie gasps] Julian. Julian, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. You... had... everything. Don't do this. We won't say anything. We don't even know anything. What you had was perfect. Why wasn't that enough? Because it wasn't real. No, let me tell you what's real. When I first found Henry... he wasn't even three years old. Every inch of his body was covered in bruises. His bones were broken, teeth missing. He was starving to death. Alone. Abandoned by the ones who were supposed to care the most. [shotgun snaps shut] I saved him. I nourished him. I loved him. I made him into the perfect human he is. And then he passed that love on to you. And what did you do in return? [sniffles] You rejected him, just like his mother did. We wouldn't have had a choice otherwise. You are so fucking self-righteous. What's the difference between programming and teaching? Henry's human, only better. I stripped out all his imperfections. Don't you see? My father was a genius. He started a revolution. A hundred years from now... we'll be living in a world without war, a world without conflict. Jesus, you're sick. Your father brainwashed you just like he did them. That's where you're quite wrong. I have full free will. Ask me not to do this, and I'll do it anyway. - [footsteps] - [shotgun fires] Henry! Stop! [grunts] - [groans] - [gasping] [grunting] [muffled scream] - Oh, Jesus. - [gasping] - [groans] - [both gasp] No. No. [gasping] Henry. Henry. I am done with this world. I knew it was real. It was. Me. [sniffles] [gasps] My feelings. My love. Everything. I'm sorry for ruining your lives. - No, Henry. - No. Henry, you didn't ruin our lives. The dreams. I could feel the... the grass on my feet. Like the air I breathe. Your... Your flaws... make you real. - [exhales] - [sniffles] [thud] We love you, Henry. We love you. I'm sorry. I'm so sorry. No. I don't want you to be. I love you. Okay? What's he doing? I can't quite see. Hey, Henry. You almost ready to go, bud? [James] We named him Henry. He often asks how he got his name. And one day we'll have to tell him that story. You were named after someone very special. But it's kind of a long story. - Will you tell me later? - Of course. Go play with your new friend before we have to go. Subtitles by explosiveskull
