He's no son of mine. That's what he says. Oh, and what does he mean by that? Well he reckons, that when I was in the hospital, after having Cyril, they give me the wrong baby, by mistake. Oh don't he talk bloody ridiculous. Cause, that's what I told him, there's no mistaking them. Now take their earlobes, to begin with. Cyrils got Bert's earlobes all over. What? All over?

And what's more, I'm getting bleeding fed up with having you, hanging about the house all day long. About time you found yourself a job, you could keep for more than five minutes. Instead of all this gallivanting around, trying to be a playboy, or something. Messing about, with silly little bits of tarts. Alright, alright, you'll get on anyone's nerves, moaning all the time. I think I got a right to moan. How old are ya? Getting on for eighteen, and look at ya. laying about like a old age pensioner. Like the rest of these yobs you hang around with. A lot of you could do with a bar of soap each. And get a bloody haircut. Your beginning to look like a right pansy. Oh give it a rest will ya. Rest? You were born with that word in your mouth. Rest. You ain't done a full weeks work since you left school a couple of years ago. Excuses. That's all you got. Excuses. And more excuses. You think me and your mother supposed to keep you forever?

What's the matter with you lot these days. And put that comic down when I'm talking to you! You seem to think the world owes you something. When I was a kid. Here we go again. When I was a kid, we didn't have it as easy as you got it nowadays. We didn't have none of these, Hydrogen bombs. And band of bomb marches and all what got now. That's your Dads Sometimes we didn't even have a enough grub on the table for all of us. Are you leaving that? They'll go mad for that in China. Bread and dripping was all we had. And lucky to get it. Hang about I'll get me violin and give you a bit of accompaniment. You'll get the back of my hand across your face, if you aren't careful. Do you want more tea? You ain't talking to your street corner yobbos now, you know. Well he's always on about when he was a kid, things have changed a bit since then you know. Things have changed alright, you all want something for nothing these days. And when I was a kid, If we wanted something, we had to work for it, a bloody sight harder than you work in your life, mate. Yeah, and just look where it's got ya. Right. That is it. That is it. I'm telling ya. Either you gets yourself a job, or out you go. I mean it. Here, here's tonight's paper. You look through that and find yourself something. And don't crease the sports page, I wants to read it, for work out the dogs. I've just about had enough of you and your shenanigans. Sam, leave him alone. Oh, by the way. Where's your precious little Joey? After six again, and the little git still ain't home. You wait till he comes rolling in. I've heard some right nice things about him today. (Children playing) Here, why don't you look where you're going? Why don't you shut your face? I'll tell your mother on you, I will. Ohh, pest of a kid (Whistling) A merry evening, to one and all. Where do you think you been? School finishes half past four, don't it? Been round me mates house, you don't get moaned at round there. Ah, don't you get saucy. I've had enough with this one here, without your contributions. Now. Who is this Elsie Morcambe? Don't ask me, never heard of her. Well that's funny. That is funny. Cause she's heard of you. And so has her old man. He comes round me works this afternoon. We had a nice little chat. All about you. And his little girl. What about his little girl? Well, it a be as if this here, Elsie Morcambe, and your little boy, have been having, afternoons off from school together, for who knows how long. Had a rare old time with her father and his suggestions as to what they've been up to. Nearly ended up with me punching him to mouth. Big headed nickle. I could have had him over What happened then, Sam? This geezer said, he's had the school board round, asking what kept his little girl away from her lessons in the afternoon. When he asked his little Elsie, who should be the Romeo of the piece, but our darling little boy. Oh, don't break his heart cruel father, he's suffered enough. You'll suffer in a minute. I don't think it very funny either. Lord knows what the pair of them have been up to. Well then Sam, what's gonna happen now? Her old man ain't gonna take it any farther. But I can promise you one thing, you better come straight home from school in future my boy, else you'll get the tanning of your life. Right where you're turning hard. What you need is a damn good hiding. Well why don't you give him one then? Instead of just talking about it. You're just as bad as they are. I've a damn good mind to. Right here and now. Anyone would think I done a crime or something. You probably have. You can thank me for getting you out of it. And how long has all this been going on? I say good luck to him. Best time to learn is when you're young, innit? Now don't start taking his part. It's obvious he don't need any encouragement from you. I'm going out. Joey. This is your final warning. Don't you dare move a step outside of this house tonight. (Laugh) Alf, you look though that paper and find yourself something, else you know what. I don't understand you kids. Why can't you find yourself something worthwhile to do. Like what? Greyhound racing? We gotta have our little bit of pleasure too, you know. What about your exams this year? I can't see you pass at anything, if this is the way you been carrying on. You'll end up a layabout, like your brother. Do you think that bothers me? They can do what they like, with their stupid exams. [Upbeat jazz music] We don't want any bother now, do we? No we don't want no trouble, we just want our money back. Now look fellas, think of it, from my point of view. To give everybody their money back, I'd have to close the place, wouldn't I? Yeah. Well then you couldn't come in here, could you? No. You wouldn't like that would ya? - No. No, well I mean you'll have to make up your mind, what would you rather have, eh? Our money back. - Yeah Them machines are definitely fixed mate. You must be making a packet. Suppose I give you all a free go. Turn him over. No! Well how much then? Three and six. Three and six? You're out of your mind? you've only just come in here, how could you have spent Three and six? I was here last night, weren't I? Yeah. I saw ya. And the night before that? Yeah, that's right. Two bob. - Shilling. And sixpence a piece. Ah, look be reasonable fellas. Lets turn him over. Alright, yea. When you've finished that, I want you to wash the things up for me. I've got to go out tonight. Oh me again? Why can't somebody else do it for a change? Because I'm telling you, that's why. Where you going then? Bingo again? Yeah, you don't mind do you? Blimey, I reckon you'd sleep down there, if you had half a chance. Anyway, why can't Doris wash the things up? It's a woman's job, if you can call her a woman. Now don't talk about your sister like that. Wouldn't be fair to ask her after a long days work. She's never in any bother. She's a good girl to me. Good girl. Cor blimey, I can tell you a few things about her, and that twit she brings home at night, when you're all in bed. Now shut up Alf. I don't wanna know any tales. You just do what you're told, and don't bother about other peoples business. I gotta go now. Tell Doris when she comes in, her tea's in the oven. A woman's work is never done. Here Mum, lend us half a dollar will you? That's a joke innit? Lend us? Come on. I ain't even got a fag, anyway. Give it back to you Friday, when I get me Dole, straight up. Oh Lord knows why I do these things. I must be mad. Oh, and I don't want that Herbie Shadbolt round here. That boy's a troublemaker. You know you're being told to stay away from him. Give us one then. It's me last one, straight up, Alf. Always is, innit. Oh, here you are then. What's up with you, then? I've gotta hurry. Freddie will be round at seven. Where's Mum? Clickety click. Again? Don't tell me, we got that creep in here again tonight? I could see me laying one his chops, the way he carries on. Jealousy, will get you nowhere. Yeah, I'm sure, I'm jealous of that stuck up burk. Here. And if he comes anymore lip with me, like he did the other night, he will be stuck up. Right up against the wall, and me kicking his head in. Your tea's in the oven, and Mother said wash those things up for her. Anyway, when Lord Frederick comes a calling, you can take him straight to your room. You'll find it more comfortable in there, than in the old parlour there, won't she? Keep our mouths shut, won't we. For a couple Bob. Is that all you think of? No, cause it ain't. I think of other things as well don't I. Like a punch up, with drippy witch. Cor blimey, I must say he got a marvelous taste in birds. Still I suppose he gets what he wants. Why don't you shut your face.

Wanna hear the springs go. # No one seems to notice me, isn't it a sin. # What a crazy world we're living in. # Mother says I look a yob, me trousers are too tight. # She think's you ought to get a job and not stay out all night. # She doesn't like your haircut. She says me friends are lousy. # And then she says, it's getting late, can't miss me ousey-ousey. # Dad's gone down the dog track, Mother's playing bingo. # Me Brother's fiddling with the telly, trying to make the thing go. # And no one seems to notice me, oh isn't it a sin. # What a crazy world we're living in. # The law caught us out thieving, took us down the nick. # The sergeant made out his report, and layed it on real thick. # He said I'll fetch your parents, we answered with a grin. # Save yourself the trouble, mate, you'll never find 'em in. # We've been slaving, in the home. Trying to make ends meet. # Trying to bring our kids up right, and keep 'em off the street. # But no one seems to notice us, isn't it a sin. # What a crazy world we're living in. # Dad's gone down the dog track, Mother's playing bingo. # All our mates are layabouts, you wanna hear their lingo. # No one seems to notice us, isn't it a sin. # What a crazy world we're living in. # What a crazy world we're living in.
