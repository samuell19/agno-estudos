(MultiCom Jingle) (rhythmic rock music) (dog pants and whines) (distant dogs bark) (mysterious instrumental music) (dogs barking) (cat yowling) (explosive bang) (gasps) (car alarm blaring) (otherworldly warbling) (gasps) (heavy metal rock music) (bike tires squeaking) (glass crunches) - Hey there, Stenson. Tryin' to wake up the entire neighborhood? - Hey, Mr. Jonas. How's everything with the Neighborhood Watch? - Oh, let me tell you, it's been a heck of a night. That freak lightening storm we had has every dog in the neighborhood spooked. I spent half the night poking around back yards to make sure that's all they were barking at. Go ahead, try it now. - Alright, cool, thanks. You know, maybe those dogs have a reason to be freaked. Whatever it was shattered our streetlight. - Don't believe everything you read, Billy. It was a lightning storm, nothing more. - Well, they're sending in the SETIs. Know who they are? They research extraterrestrial life. They don't look into lightning strikes. - Yeah, I've heard of 'em. Just another waste of the taxpayers' money. Keep it. - I can't take this. - I have a whole drawer full of them. Use it on an extraterrestrial, if they hold you up on your way to Mrs. Gibson's. Can't keep her waiting, you know. - Thanks. - Thank you. (upbeat rock music) - You are late again, young Mr. Stenson. - Sorry, Mrs. Gibson. - [Gibson] You ought to be. I see no reason why my paper shouldn't be on my porch by the time I get up in the morning. - I'll try harder, really, I will. - Why a old kid like you delivering papers, anyway? Shouldn't you be out driving too fast and getting into trouble with the cops? - Well, I'm savin' up for a car so I can, Mrs. Gibson. It's extra money and they can't find anyone to take the route. And you ask me that every time I come by, remember? - (scoffs) Of course I remember, smart aleck. Maybe I just don't like your bicycle. (upbeat rock music) (suspenseful music) (guitar chords) (ominous tones) - Yeah. - I'm telling you, it wasn't there yesterday morning. Not even tire tracks, no footprints, nothing. Just sitting there in the middle of the block, with this weird gargoyle or something like that. - Gargoyle? That's cool. - Except, there were no windows, man. No doors, either. It's like one of those spaceships you see on the midnight movie. No propulsion system goes around without making a sound and just hums before landing. I mean, how else could it have gotten there, without making a trace? - You think you saw a UFO. - Is he for real? - He's always making stuff like that up. You should see his room, it's full of monsters and creepy stuff. I don't know why my parents let him keep it all. Hey. - What's funny? - Katie's little brother saw a UFO. - Wait. - Haha, very funny. (laughing) - Alright, what do we do? - You have access to the school's video camera, right? - Yeah, but if I get caught taking any of that stuff off the school property-- - Come on. I mean, how cool would it be if we actually got this on videotape before the SETI team arrives? - Yeah, how cool would it be if I got kicked out of every public school in the US? - Kevin, you're always telling me how you wanna be a camera man, right? I mean, think about it, think about the attention we'd get. Kevin, follow your dreams. Pulitzer-prize winning cameraman. Boy hero who showed this world, that we are not alone. Who knows, maybe you'll even get to meet the president. - Well a Pulitzer would be cool to help my career. - Sweet. - Oh no, UFPs, look at them all! - Yeah, unidentified flying potatoes. (laughing) - I love these things. I don't know why Mom won't buy them for us. - Maybe 'cause she knows that eating too many of these will turn you into a techno geek like our buddy Kev here. - Leave him alone. - What's the matter, Stenson? Afraid pencil-butt here will go hungry? - Yeah, like maybe there won't be enough of him to dissect when he's abducted by the UFO? - Are you kidding? With that sack he carries, that spaceship wouldn't be able to lift off with him on board, they'll be stuck here. - You're stuck looking like your ugly face. - Hey, hey, guys. He didn't say anything, did you, Bill? - No, I didn't say anything. Important. (bell rings) - By 1848, the California Gold Rush was in full swing. The town of Knollwood prospered as entire families settled here. The trouble was, the surrounding hills didn't yield any gold. Prospectors started leaving town. In order to keep food on their tables, those who stayed formed a coalition. Together, they began mining for coal, and Knollwood Mining Company became one of America's first employee-owned companies. All that changed when one of the miners discovered a large diamond. Is there a problem here, Kevin? - No, sir. I was... - [Teacher] Talking in the middle of my lesson. - Actually, he was just saying that, something that size couldn't possibly be a diamond. - And you agree with him? - Come on, sir. I don't think my mom would wear that thing on her finger. - I see. Maybe she'd rather wear this instead, dubbed the Light of the Moon. It is the largest diamond in recorded history. The population soared as people came here looking to strike it rich. Months passed without anything but coal being found. Miners dug further and further through unstable ground, and in the frenzy, catastrophe struck. 12 miners became trapped in one of the shafts. Local legend has it, the mine is still haunted, with those 12 dead men. - Good one, Mr. D. Spooked me right up there. - What ever happened to the diamond? - Good question. No one really knows. It was being transported by steam locomotive to a museum in New York. It left the night of the mine disaster. Three days later, a message came in. It never made it through the Cascade Mountain pass. Simply vanished. Into the moonlit night. (bell rings) Papers are due on Wednesday, no excuses! - [Boy] Yeah, okay. - What's with them? - [Bill] Oh, that's the Andersons. They're not too big on kids much. - This place is weird, man. Every house looks exactly the same. And what's with these little kids? - Kevin's not here, Mrs. Anderson. Kevin's gone away. - Stop it! - Redrum! - You know I hate that, man. - Hey, there's the Danvers' place, he's pretty cool. Except for the lawn ornaments. - He only moved here a few years ago. He used to be a professional soccer player for Romania. - Romania, cool, that's where Dracula comes from. How come he doesn't have an accent? I want to you give you a B but it's not good, I give you a C. No? - Wait a minute, you haven't heard about this? - About what? - Well, 20 years ago he was flying to America for some World Cup demonstration thing, when his plane crashed into the side of Mount Miguel. Danvers was the only survivor. Ever since then he never went back to Romania. Whoa! Is that it? Oh, man. You were right, man, this thing is trippy. Trippiness! (suspenseful music) - What are you boys doing here? (Kevin yelps) You boys don't belong in here. This is a private property. - Um-- - You are trespassing. - We were just, uh-- - I don't want to see you back here unless you are delivering papers. And you'd better be on time when you do. - Yes, ma'am. (suspenseful music) Hey, dad, did you read the paper today? - [Dad] Let me guess, the article that mentioned the strange lights in the sky, right? - Yeah. Do you think the SETI team will find anything? - [Dad] Those guys setting up the old observatory? What do you think they're gonna find? - Come on, like a UFO. - There are a millions explanations for what could cause those lights. A low-flying plane, I don't know. - So, has rocket-boy here been telling you about the UFO he saw this morning? - The one you saw? Oh, Bill, you can't make up stories like that. Not at your age. - I'm not making it up, why else would the government send in a team of SETI specialists? - You're never gonna fit in at school if you don't stop acting so weird, paperboy. - I don't wanna fit in with your stupid friends anyway. - Bill, that's enough. - I'm sorry. Bride of Frankenstein. - Billy. - She's got these friends who are made up like they're in a monster movie and they have these pet gorillas who keep picking on me and Kev. - You ask for it, dweeb. - Oh, I'm sorry, I forgot about the part where I asked Andy and Randy to please throw mashed potatoes at me and I also-- - Billy, that's enough. Eat. And, Katie. You don't help by calling your brother a dweeb. (upbeat rock music) (moody music) (tapping) (beeping) - You know those games will rot your brains. What's left of them. Wait here, I'll be back. (ominous tones) (high-pitched whine) (eerie atmospheric music) It is always dark in the space between stars. And now that darkness comes to Knollwood. (door hisses and rumbles) - [Man] Easy. Come on, all right. - Be careful, guys, this is the system. - [Man] Oh, good save. - $50,000 worth of satellite up-link and I bust it before we get it set-up. - Let's just get this stuff inside. I want it up and operational by sunset. - Ah, There's no way. - Sure there is. (thuds) Okay. Not a problem. (eerie atmospheric music) (explosion blasts) (alarm wails) (alarm wails) (dogs bark) (Bill screams) (glass shatters) - [Man] GPS hyperlink extensions are online. Washington's authorized the use of all four transponders. - Perfect timing, we should be able to link up to the CompSite satellite in about, about two minutes. - Oh, great. We only missed sunset by about nine hours. Can we go back to the motel now? - Nope, I wanna run a geo thermal scan of the town first. Establish a normal reading so we have our records booked. - Oh, feels good. - You gonna finish that? - No, here. I prefer not to eat my dinner at six in the morning anyhow. - Yes. (beeping) That should be the power transformer on Eterna Road. And that's the incinerator, here we go. This one, this one's reading harder blows and it's coming from an unpopulated area. - Whatever it is, it's not bothering those train tracks. - The engine tower's about a mile away from it. It was the announced development cycle. - Well, it's too late to get any sleep now. What do you say we go check it out? - [Man] Good idea. - The heat sensors and video gear are still in the van. - You want to go now? - Have to, if we wait 'til the sun's fully up, the sensors won't be as effective. - Guys, anyway I can renegotiate my part so I'm getting paid by the hour? Guys? (upbeat rock music) (eerie atmospheric music) (siren wails) (high-pitched tone) (electricity zaps) - You all right, kid? - [Long-Haired Man] Where did that green light come from? - [Bill] It came from there. All I did was touch it. Wait a minute, wait a minute, you're that team from SETI. - Oh yeah, yeah, Mike, Paula and Hank. - Hi, I'm Bill Stenson. - You from around here? - Uh, I live in Knollwood Estates. It's like three blocks from here. But this thing, whatever you wanna call it, is not from around here. It's only been here a couple of days. I noticed it the morning after I saw the UFO. - You saw a UFO? - Yeah. - Alright, Mike, get the C1 case from the van. I wanna do an elemental scan. Paula, you take Bill back to the van. I wanna see if we can get this thing to discharge again. - That's cool. So do these guys know what they're doing? - They might not look like, but yeah, they do. They are two of the best, that's why they were sent. And your town is a hot spot right now, and they want to find out what's up. - So what's your job? - My job? Public relations. You can't imagine what the people think when they see us roll into town. (chuckles) It's a little weird sometimes, but it's fun. Ah, the other thing I do is keep them from getting into trouble. (torch hisses) Like right now, for example, you stay here. (suspenseful music) Did you find anything or are you just about to destroy someone's personal property to make my life more difficult? - No, this metal isn't like anything I've seen before. I mean, there are traces of Mercury, but it's definitely not one of the periodic elements. - Yeah, we wanna see that it has the same flashpoint as any of the lampton series. - Like the kid said, this ain't from around here. - Wait a minute, you mean you don't know what the thing is made of, so you are going to light it on fire to see? - Yeah. - What if it's made of, uh, silver dynamite? You could set fire to North America doing that. - Uh-uh! - Yeah. - Heads up! (electricity zaps) - Oh, yeah! - Did you ever see anything on Earth do that before? - Man! Mike, get the camera from the van. We've got to get this on tape! Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa! Listen, listen, kid, thanks so much for your help, but uh, we're dealing with a potentially dangerous situation here. I think it would be best if you left right now. - No, I found it. - Okay, (chuckles) fair enough. Listen, if you leave now, come by the old observatory after school, I'll personally show you around the base of operations. Let you in on our findings. I'll even make you an honorary member of the SETI team. What do you say? - Okay, if I can bring my friend Kevin along. - Deal! Oh, Bill, not a word of this to anyone. - No. Bye. - Yeah. (laughs) (suspenseful music) (Gibson growls) (chuckles) Uh, Houston, we have a problem. This thing isn't touching the ground. (laughs) Tell Mike to hurry up! - [Raspy Voice] I've come too far to be stopped now. You told me everything was in order. - Don't worry. I'll take care of this little problem myself. - Guys! Guys? Major scientific discovery here, needs a little attention. Hello! Uh, come on, guys, this is not funny. Hey, guys? - He said he'd make me an honorary member of the SETI team. - Oh, wicked. And then he's gonna show us all their stuff? - Dude, I was in the van. You should see the equipment they have. Heat sensors, geothermal up-links, GPS equipment. I can't wait to see what they have in the old observatory. - So I should bring my camera, right? - The mutants. - Hey look, everyone, it's the little green men from outer space. - He's not that little. - Yeah, but he sure is pretty green. You okay, Kev? - Leave him alone. - Shut up, dude, he wasn't talking to you. - Yeah, Katie, your brother sure is clumsy. - Alright, that's enough, alright? You've made your point. The smaller they are, they farther they fly, now lay off. - [Andy] You're next, man. - Andy. Randy. You two know better than that. - You okay, man? (suspenseful music) (computer bleeps) (phone bleeps) - Yeah, hi, get me the sheriff's office. (gasps) Let me guess, you're the sheriff? - No. (Hank groans) Neighborhood Watch. (snarls) - [Bill] Hey, we're here. - Bring me to your leader. - [Jonas] Stenson. - Mr. Jonas. Did we come at a bad time? - No, no, of course not. I just dropped by to welcome Hank here to Knollwood, on behalf of the Neighborhood Watch group. - Well, we came for the tour, but we could come back later. - Yeah, we could come back if you would-- - No, no, perfect timing. - Well then, I best be going. I wouldn't wanna spoil your little tour. Besides, Mrs. Gibson asked me to stop by her house. Seems there have been some trespassers over in her neighborhood. I'll catch you later, Hank. I know the other members of the Neighborhood Watch group are dying to meet you. Perhaps we'll all stop by. Later. - Whoa, weird guy! (machine whines) - Did you guys... Never mind, never mind. Look, on second thought, maybe best if you came back some other time. - Where are Mike and Paula? (Hank chuckles) - I wish I knew. - What do you mean? - They're gone, vanished. This is all I found. - Found where? - This morning, after you left they both disappeared. - These are the old mine shafts. - Mine shafts? - Yeah. - Hey, there must be some underneath that silver thing. Maybe they found a down shaft. - Mine shafts, that would explain the geothermal readings I'm getting from the equipments. - Hey, well we could help you find them. - Oh no, not me, those mines have been condemned for over 100 years, they're dangerous. Not to mention haunted. Well, they are. - No. Nope, nope. I'll go check with the sheriff, I'm sure he can help me get some men together and help me search the area. - Really? - Yeah, yeah. - Is it okay if I catch a ride to tomorrow's game with Vanessa's mom? - Katie, I thought we were all going together. - I know, it's just Vanessa's mom's got this amazing convertible. - Sounds okay to me. Just be sure and look for us up in the stands. - Bill, honey, you hardy touched your dinner. (doorbell rings) - Dad, can you get that? It's Jesse, we're going to a little pre-game party. - If it's Jesse, why don't you get it? - Dad, I can't let him see me in these rags. - [Dad] Hi there, Jesse, come on in. - Thanks. - [Mom] Jesse, can I get you anything? - Oh, no thanks, Mrs. Stenson. Hey, Bill. - Hey. - [Dad] You guys, you know each other? - [Jesse] Oh, sure. - So, are you all ready for the big game? - I hope so. - Oh, don't be nervous. You are going to do great. - Well, Huntsville's got a great team this year, so it's gonna be tough game. - Between you and those twins you have on your line, your team's been unstoppable. (Mom laughs) - Hey, you. - Hey. - [Katie] Don't wait up for me. - Hey. - Very funny. - Remember, 12:30 on the dot, no later. - Sure thing, Mrs. Stenson. - Okay, bye. - Bye. (suspenseful music) - Katie just left, you've got dish duty. - Oh what, she left? I gotta tell her something before she went. - Leave her be, she's fine, she's with Jesse. - Yeah, she's fine, nothing to worry about. Unless of course the Neighborhood Watch happens by, and starts a fighting. (sighs) (leaves crunch) (suspenseful music) (Kevin shouts) Back in a second. (Kevin shouts) - Didn't mean to scare ya, Bill. - I wasn't scared. - Sure you weren't. - What are you doing out here? The eclipse isn't until tomorrow. - Ah, see, this is even better. See, I overheard Chloe and Vanessa talking in the nurse's office today because after Mr. Daniels' class I was all vomiting and just sick and spitting up my-- - Kev. Kev, Kev. - Oh yeah, I know where the soccer team is having that pre-game party tonight. And all the cheerleaders are going to be there. - Yeah and my sister, she just left, so what? - Well, they're having it on Tombstone Hill. - By the old mine shaft. - Yeah. - I've gotta make sure they won't be in those mine shafts. - Whoa, wait a minute, I just wanted to spy on their party, not break it up. - Kevin, you saw how spooked Hank was, there is something weird going on in this town, we both know it. - Wait, whoa, what are you doing? - There's something else you should know. What do you know about vampires, Kevin? - [Kevin] Vampires, I saw this movie with this guy, this vampire chews off her face. (wolf howls) - It's true. Every night, the ghosts of the 12 dead miners, roam around the dark shafts looking for a way out. But, a night like this is different. The light of the full moon draws the miners all the way out of the shafts. (Randy shouts and laughs) - Gotcha! (laughs) - You guys are such jerks. - You are good. - No, you're good. - Together we're better! - Together we're better! (cheer and laugh) - Knollwood Wolves, Knollwood Wolves, Knollwood Wolves! Knollwood Wolves, Knollwood Wolves, Knollwood Wolves! - What's up? - Whatever you do, just, promise me you won't start acting like those two. - Who, Andy and Randy? Not a chance. - What's gotten into them? - They've always been obnoxious. - You don't see a difference? They've changed. - Knollwood! Knollwood! - I don't know how to describe it, it's like... It's like when you look in their eyes, they're not even real anymore. - They're just excited about the game, you know? Let them have their fun, they're harmless. - Knollwood Wolves! - Katie? Are you ready to go? - Where are you going? - Vanessa's technically grounded. She's supposed to be at my house studying, I told her I'd walk her home so her parents don't go basaltic. - Well, I'll take you home. - No, you stay here and have fun. Talk to you tomorrow. - Well, this isn't gonna be much fun without you here, so, why don't you let me take you home? - Okay. - Alright. (Andy and Randy howl) - [Kevin] Oh, there they are. Hey, they're burnin' somethin' in the fire over there. - Do you see Katie? - Uh, no. Hey, that thing in the fire looks like a body, man. - I wanna see. - Alright, one, two, three. - Knollwood Wolves, Knollwood Wolves, Knollwood Wolves! Knollwood Wolves, Knollwood Wolves! - That's not a body. It's a dummy, man, Huntsville Goldworst uniform. - Well, what do you want from me? It's dark out, it looks like a body and it's on fire. Where are you going? - I gotta make sure no one goes in or out of those mines. - Well, I'm not going. Especially since you told me about the... - Kevin, Katie is supposed to be out here somewhere. - Well yeah, but... Well fine, I'll stay here. (suspenseful music) Bill? Bill? Billy? - This is crazy. Kevin? - Hey, hey, I can't see anything. - Hank? - What are you guys doing here? - Uh, there's a party over the hill. We wanna go make sure no one goes near the mine. - You should leave. - [Bill] Where's the rest of your team? - [Hank] Still lookin' for 'em. - What about the sheriff? - I can't find him, let alone Paula and Mike. - Well, did you check the station? - Yeah, it's the first place I checked. There's no one there, in fact, this whole place is like a ghost town. - What do you mean? - It's like everybody closed up shop and left. - Well, where do you think they went? - To the safety of their homes, which is where you two should be right now. - Yeah, yeah, Bill, we gotta go. - Yeah, listen to your buddy, I feel like things are gonna get a whole lot worse before daybreak. - Uh well, it's been fun, but I gotta run. Come on, are you coming with me? - Come on, we can't leave now. - Uh, sure we can. Come on, Bill, let's go. - No, I'm gonna stay. - Suit yourself, I'm gonna go back into town and uh, grab some help, alright? I'll be back with some firepower. - Thanks. (eerie music) You're going the wrong way. - Look, kid, I told you to go home, now beat it. - You see this sign? - Yeah, what's it mean, pirates are here? - Maybe danger, Hank. This tunnel leads to the one that collapsed and killed those miners. - Yeah well, the readings I'm getting indicate some kind of movement down here. - I really think you're going the wrong way. You see, this one, the one with the wood, that's a lot safer. - Alright. How did you get to be such an expert on this place? - I did a project on the Knollwood Mines. (clattering) You know they say this place is haunted. - Haunted miners I could deal with. I just hope we don't run into any more crossing guards with bad dental plans. There's a light down there. - [Denvers] Everyone is gathered, it is time. - Mr. Denvers? That was my history teacher, what is he doing with that-- - Extraterrestrial that used to be Mike. - [Bill] This stuff doesn't happen for real, does it? - [Hank] Don't ask me, kid. - Man, (pants) somebody's gone to a lot of trouble to make this mine home. - Master Vlathos traveled great distances to find this. At the time he arrived, it had already been found by a mortal man. The humans did not realize the awesome power they had unearthed, but Vlathos knew. He snatched it away from them. I give you... The Light of the Moon! (aliens growl and snarl) This is no ordinary gemstone. There are only two others like it on this earth which come close to its power and beauty, but this, this one forms the centerpiece of the Trinity of Darkness. When the Trinity comes together, the light of the Sun and the Moon, will forever leave this world. And this Earth will be plunged forever into eternal darkness then, children, my master, Vlathos, will call his people from the stars, and Knollwood will serve as their first feeding ground and you will live forever as their servants. (Vlathos snarls) (aliens snarl and growl) (Vlathos snarls) (gems chime) (aliens snarl and growl) - I have been waiting for centuries for this moment to arrive. In a few hours, the Sun shall rise and fall on the town of Knollwood for the last time. Tomorrow at this hour, the Moon will walk the sky, and when it crawls with the Sun, blackness shall reign. And the minions of the Moon will rule the Earth! (roars) (whooshes) - Oh man, the Sun and Moon did something to that diamond? That's bad, right? - That's bad. It's very bad. It's very, very, very, very bad. - So what do we do now? - We can't leave here without bringing the stone. Take it to a phone, call somebody with some experience in dealing with stuff like this. What? You're gonna get yourself killed. (whispers) What can we do to stop them? We're two guys, come on. - I don't see my sister up there, or Paula. But those people, those creatures look pretty much like the people from my paper route. That means Vlathos has a new diamond not too far from home. - Let's go. (wolf howls) (eerie atmospheric music) (Andy snarls) (girl screams) - [TV Reporter] Communication lines are sketchy, in and out of Knollwood. Channel 8's reporter on the scene has been out of contact with us for the last two hours. We have unconfirmed reports of more strange lights and even the Moon itself-- - Oh, hi, Billy. - Goodnight, Mom. - Goodnight, honey. - [TV Reporter] Yes, it looks like a good night to stay inside and just watch our midnight late-night horror flick. (dark piano music) (knocks) (door creaks) (wolf howls) (moody rock music) - [Hank] You showed up. - What choice do I have? Did you try her cellphone again? - Nothing. Long-distance phone lines are down, I even went back to the sheriff's office and tried the radio. Vlathos has generated some kind of interference field over the whole town. I tried driving out, but there was sheriff's car with Mr. Jonas deputy blocking the bridge. - So what are we doing in a library? Shouldn't we be out trying something like, I don't know, sharpening stakes or hanging garlic from the street lights? - 'Cause I am not gonna go up and stick a garden stake into that bad boy unless I know he's not gonna stake me back. I'm a scientist, Bill, I don't commit to a line of action unless I have empirical evidence. - And you joined SETI because their filing cabinets are filled with evidence? - My father picked this up in Roswell, New Mexico. - Roswell? The Roswell, the UFO Area 51, men in black, that Roswell? - He picked it up at the crash site. He was there that night. Part of the cleanup crew. He spent the rest of his life trying to tell anyone who'd listen what he'd seen. I was one of the ones who listened. Empirical evidence. (otherworldly chimes) - Ready to go, coach. Team's suited up and ready to go. - Any sign of Andy or Randy? - Not yet. What'll we do if they don't show? - Well, I'll just have to alter my game-plan, then. I wanna show you something. - The Sun. - What? - The Sun, sunlight, each one of these agrees on one thing. Check this out. If a vampire is exposed to sunlight, it will burn, and if enough of him is burnt, it will kill him. And you don't even have to get close to this guy, we'll just phase him with sunlight. - What about his little undead army? - Okay, they're not immortal until the head guy, Dracula, Vlathos, says they are. They can walk around in the sun all they want. That's why they're useful to him. But they'd die like everyone else. We'll just drop a big rock on 'em, or hit them with a cave pin, anything. - Bill, they're your neighbors. - Hank, anyone trying to bite me and turn me into some kind of space vampire is officially no longer my teacher, my neighbor, or my best friend. Anyway, they should turn back to normal, if we take out the head vampire. In theory. - In theory? - Yep. (Hank sighs) - Man, I need more coffee. I need a computer. (spectators cheer) - [Announcer] Let's warmly welcome our visiting team, the Huntsville Goldbagger. (spectators jeer) And now, making their way onto the pitch, our home team, the Knollwood Wolves! (spectators cheer and applaud) (machine hums) - That is one sick lookin' Sun. - Nothing. Alright. Okay. Vlathos said, "when the Moon walks the sky, "and crawls with the Sun," he was talking about-- - The lunar eclipse, it's tonight. - Yeah, now a total lunar eclipse occurs when the Sun, Earth and Moon are in a straight line, and the shadow of the Earth falls on the Moon. Now when this happens, there's a distant gravitational line from the Sun to the Moon that passes through the Earth. This lineup does wonky things with tides, but... It also creates power point, a mini gravitational well on the Moon's side of the Earth. - So, why Knollwood? - It's the nexus. - So we're in direct line between the Sun and the Moon. That's why Vlathos is here now. (Hank sighs) - And you thought he was here for the soccer finals. - White and red, red and white. Red and white are here to fight. Watch your back 'cause Knollwood Wolves will attack. All you people over here we need to hear you loud and clear. Stomp your feet, clap your hands. Make some noise in the stands, cheer our boys to victory. - Excuse me now. Thank you. - There's hardly anybody here. - I know. - We need to hear you loud and clear. Stomp your feet, clap your hands. - Hi, Kev. - Hi, Kevin. - Is Bill with you? - No, (mumbles). - [Cheerleaders] Stomp your feet and clap your hands. Make some noise in the stands, cheer our boys to victory. Red and white, red and white are here to fight. High school players, watch your back. Knollwood Wolves will attack. All you people over here we need to hear you loud and clear. Stomp your feet, clap your hands. Make some noise in the stands. - Are they ready, coach? - I've found them, they should be here any minute. (audience cheers and applauds) You boys had better be ready to play. - Rip roaring and ready, coach. - We've been practicing. - Yeah, all night practicing. - Go get changed and cleaned up, you've got two minutes. (suspenseful music) (phone bleeps) - Okay. Come on, internet, don't fail me now. (computer bleeps) (machine zaps and crackles) Hm. I guess Danvers and his alien buddy or his vampires, they've obviously shut down the access to the net. (Bill sighs) - Actually, my server sometimes does that if I key in a bad password. Hey, check this out. The first recorded lunar eclipse was in June 1849. That's the same night that the mine collapsed, and it's also the night that the Light of the Moon diamond disappeared. - Then there's another one in 1869, 1889, 1939, 1959, 1979. - Every 20 years. And something weird and unexplained happens every time. People disappear, lights in the sky. - Even in a plane crash. - Danvers. - This is a very special game, and this is a very special day. I want you guys to play like there's no tomorrow. - [Players] Yeah! - [Danvers] Let's make Huntsville pay for all those years they won and we lost. - Yeah! - Let's show them why Knollwood rules the day! - [Players] Yeah! Knollwood, Knollwood, Knollwood, Knollwood, Knollwood! (suspenseful music) (whistle blows) - [Man] Hey, let's go! (lively music) (players shout) - Come on! (spectators cheer and applaud) (Mom laughs) (otherworldly tones) - Wow, there's light, but no heat. - Hey, hey! Don't touch that. That shaft is pure sunlight. The Trinity wants the Sun's light, not its energy, but if nothing else, that'll give you the world's fastest tan. - Cool. (Hank chuckles) (moody music) (machine bleeps) Ready? (aliens snore and snarl) - They say the darkest spot is just beneath the candle. - A spot that is gonna make it difficult to get that diamond. Best friends don't make the best welcome mat. - I already sense that. You wanna wait till their alarm goes off or... - I got the trigger. - And I lost the coin toss. Wish me luck. - Hank! I'm so happy it's you. - Paula, what happened? - I don't know. I blacked out at the van and when came out I was surrounded by this. I am ever glad to see you. - Mike's one of them now. - I know, I know. We have to get out of here. - No, Paula. - Why not? - There's something we have to do. - What do you wanna do? - [Hank] Listen, I want you to just stay here. - Hank. - Holy! (Paula snarls) (spectators shout and cheer) (whistle blows) (spectators cheer and applaud) - Knollwood Wolves on the attack. Come so brave on their back. Go Jesse! Woo! (Randy and Andy snarl) (whistle blows) - Way to go, boys! Good work! (spectators cheer) That's it, Jesse, keep it up! (otherworldly chimes) (suspenseful music) (aliens snarl and yawn) (lively music) (spectators cheer) (whistle blows) Take five, boys, we've got this one in the bag! (cheerleaders cheer) - Hey, you! You're all sweaty. - Katie, I've got something to tell you. Come here. It's about Andy and Randy. - They're on fire today, aren't they? Maybe you were right, maybe it is just the game that makes them act a little weird. - [Jesse] Actually, it's a little bit more than that. (Katie screams) (whistle blows) (Paula snarls) (Bill chokes) - Welcome to the dark, bug. - Try somethin'. (Vlathos grunts) - Swiss. Good steel. (laughs) For carving apples. Not exactly a killing blade. - Oh, my glasses! (groans) Paula! That hurt! (aliens snarl) This is not funny. Take off, we'll lose the dentures and let's go home, huh? - Join us, little man. We need as much young blood as we can get in our army. Soon your little town will forever say goodbye to the Sun, and the Moon. And remember, in the darkness, there is no choice. Join us now, or you will become a midnight snack for my people. - Hank! My neighbors are getting a little out of control here. - The snake pit. Go on, get off! I'm serious, back! (aliens groan) (spectators cheer and applaud) - Cheer our boys to victory. Huntsville players turn and flee. There's only one thing left to say. Knollwood Wolves rule the day. - Almost there, boys. Almost there. - Hey! (grunts) - I am tired of you, human. - I think this is yours! (Vlathos screams) (Vlathos screams) - Don't foul him, don't foul him! - Coach? - Coach, are you okay? - Are you okay? (otherworldly chimes) (Vlathos screams) - No! (whistle blows) - Oh my god. (whistle blows) - What? - What is that? (Kevin snarls) - Sit down, Kevin. - Take me home. It's awful. (chimes) (Vlathos screams) - Get them! Get them! (screams) - Jesse. Andy, Randy. To me. Let's bring the girl, her brother's giving us trouble. - What's the little dweeb done this time? (all snarl) - Now! (machine bleeps) (Vlathos groans) - It's only sunlight. - Kinda like the way it brightens up the place, you know? - You can stand there and mock with immunity, humans, for less than five minutes, but you can see, the Trinity of the Darkness, it still drinks the light of your Sun. In 212 seconds, this light will be spent. The Sun will set on the world, for a final time, and then, we'll see where this taunting of your master gets you. - But your power won't be complete until the total lunar eclipse lines up with the Sun and the Moon. (Vlathos laughs) - I am amazed by how dense this human race truly is. And you, a fledgling space cadet. When the Sun sets, the security vents dies with it. (laughs) - What happens to the Light of the Moon once it's sucked in all the light? Who will handle it for you? It can't be one of these losers. - That's where I come in. - Katie! - As you can see, Bill, I am unaffected by the Sun's light. Therefor I will be the bearer of the Light of the Moon, and I will sit at Master Vlathos' right hand, ruling the armies of the night. (chuckles) I would reserve a special place for you and my young friend there. But unfortunately, you both would last only a very short time in the dark. - You know, I hate the dark. You can't see anything and you're always out buying flashlight batteries, it is such a hassle. - But if you had one of these, you wouldn't have to worry about paying an electric bill for the next 2,000 years! - The Sun has set, the diamond is unstable, until the eclipse is completed. Have a care with it. - Bill? You hold the light of the Sun and the Moon in your hands. It's a volatile and dangerous thing for everyone here. Including you and your sister. (aliens snarl) Katie, make your brother behave. - Billy. You've always wanted something like this to be true. - Forget it, Katie. When was the last time I did anything you asked me to do? This is the only way. - Child! Give me the diamond now! And I will spare you and your kin. - I tell you what, you take these two, and we keep that one and we'll call it square, huh? (Vlathos screams) - Give me the diamond! - Okay! (Vlathos screams) - [Vlathos] My people! (screams) (people talking over each other) (peaceful atmospheric music) (group cheer) (upbeat music) - Hey, thanks for being such a loser, and not listening to your sister back there. - I promise I never will. - Katie! - Momma. - Oh, man. I missed all the good stuff. All I did all day was watch some stupid soccer game. Weird guy. - So how did we do? - Well, we lost, by default, because Jesse here bit the ref. (chuckles) - Hey, wait a minute. - What? - You didn't miss everything. If Vlathos is dead, his spaceship is still here. - No way! - Yeah. - Well... Hello, Pulitzer. (suspenseful tones) (moody electronic music)
