Still not finished? Get on with it! Sorry to keep you waiting. We're currently printing the new calendar for the Imperial Palace and we're a bit behind on the rest of our orders. It's a large order and we're responsible for all the copies for the Western region. - You're late! How many have you got? - 300. Bring the other 200 by tonight or I'll only pay you half. Please make your selection from this catalogue. These aren't quite what I was after. My client wants something classic. I was told that Mohei could sort it out. ls he here? - Wake Mohei up. Master Kuze is here. - Yes, sir. Printing a special calendar for every house, that's like having a tree that bears golden fruit. Most other merchants are experiencing a slump in business but this place seems to be thriving. The owner of this place is very hard to please and very particular. Maybe he does it by paying his staff next to nothing! Mohei, you have to get up. Master Kuze is here. He wants the sample of gold brocade. It's in the second... Listen, you'll find it in the second cupboard along. You're the only one who can tell the brocades apart. Please get up. Quickly. There's no rest for the wicked! Osan? Osan? Osan? What is it? What are you doing here? - Where's lshun? - He's out. Good. Listen, I have a favour to ask of you. I'll come in through there. - Osan, I have no one else... - Good clay, madam. - Can you lend me ﬁve kan of gold? - Good day. It's all a bit sudden. If it's to pay off your debts to courtesans again... No, not at all! It's for the interest payments on the home. Our family home? My loans to the courtesans haven't been returned yet, so I'm in real trouble. I've had to ask others to lend me some money. Please, I'm begging you. Please help me out. I've raised enough to pay off a third of the interest, but I'm missing the rest. If I don't pay it in three days, they'll throw me in prison. I can't believe you're in this position! - Madam? - What is it? Your mother is here to see you. Don't tell her you've seen me. I'll be back tomorrow for the money. I'm just taking this up to Mohei. See to the back rooms for me. She runs around for Mohei like she's his wife. I wonder what Mohei thinks of Otama. If you're so worried, why don't you go and ask him, then? - I've prepared you some broth. - Thank you. Listen to you, you should be resting. I have work to do. I won't be able to care for you while madam's mother is here. - Her mother, you say? - Yes. Otama, has anything strange happened in their family? I have no idea. Here you go. Eat up before it goes cold. - There. - Otama! Coming! I'll see you later. Thank you so much. - Otama! - She's so impatient. Your brother has never been that clever... and we've tended to scorn him since your father passed away. I've remonstrated with him, but if he's arrested, just imagine the damage it will do to our business. We must avoid this shame at all costs. You know how quickly rumours can spread in business. It's a terrible embarrassment to me, but could you ask your husband just once more to help us out? I will ask him. Ever since I was engaged to become his wife, I have always felt so ashamed asking him for money. Welcome back, sir. Welcome back, sir. - How's the work going for the Minister? - Well, Mohei's been in bed with a cold. Get him up! I promised it would be completed by this evening. - Have you been with the Minister, sir? - Yes. These nobles deign to drink with us only when we're the ones paying. - Welcome home, sir. - Welcome back. Welcome home, sir. - Where's Osan? - She's with her mother, sir. I see... Welcome home, sir. Welcome home. Welcome back, master. Pass me a headrest. So, have you thought about it? Please, let go of me, master. Don't be like that. Just think of the benefits for you. You have no parents, no family, and I'm offering you a life of luxury. I prefer to remain just as I am, thank you. You might, but I certainly don't! To tell you the truth... I'm engaged to be married. What? Don't tell lies. I'm not lying. Tell me, who is he? Don't make it up. Who is he? It's Mohei. Mohei? Please, I beg you, do not come to my room anymore. I'll come whenever I please, until you give me the answer I want. Welcome home, my dear. Forgive me for not coming sooner. I'm exhausted. I had to stay out drinking with the Minister all night. - Your mother's gone? - Yes. - What did she want? - Well, she... - If she's after money, tell her I refuse! - No... she came to see the neighbours. Speaking of which, Sukeyemon told me you'd offered my sister some capital. But your elder sister asked for the money. I refuse to lend money even to my siblings! Oh, Mohei... are you feeling up to this? I'm fine. I'm all right to do some work. Are you sure? - How did you know that's the one? - Just by watching. - So, do you intend to marry a printer? - Of course. What's wrong? I'm sorry to trouble you, but if the master should mention me to you, would you please say that we're engaged to be married? I can't do that. The master is chasing after me so much, it's the only thing I could say to deter him. The master? I couldn't. I'd do anything for you, but I couldn't tell lies. But I'm bound by a contract and cannot leave here. - Of course not. - Would you rather I gave in to him? Not at all. I've thought many times of telling his wife. You mustn't, that would be a disaster. Primarily, his wife would suffer more than he would. Listen... In any event, you must do nothing that would tarnish the family's reputation. You'll just have to put up with it for now, understand? You mustn't forget that you're just an employee here. Right? Hey, everybody! Some adulterous lovers are to be crucified! Come quick! - It's the wife and servant of a samurai. - A samurai's wife and his own servant? - Right. - There they are! Make way! Make way! Make way! They'll be nailed to a cross and then left there for public viewing. It's a dishonour upon their entire family. This is the cruel fate that awaits adulterers. If a samurai does not kill the adulterer himself, he loses his rank. Surely it's better to die by the hand of one's husband than suffer such a fate. Oh, Mohei... have you recovered from your illness? Yes, thank you for your concern, madam. That's good. Madam? I heard your mother had arrived. ls there anything wrong? Why do you ask? There is nothing at all wrong. Mohei, why is it that men have the right to commit adultery, yet if a woman is caught, she's nailed to a cross? - It's a cruel injustice! - Watch what you say. Why must they be crucified? They didn't kill anyone or steal anything! - It's absolutely tragic. - Don't you feel pity for them, Mohei? Of course I feel pity for them, but they broke the law, that's why they're being punished. Thank you. - I brought you a warm drink. - What is it? It's eggnog. Drink it quickly. Thank you. Mohei. Mohei! ls it all ready? - I managed to finish it. - I bet it almost killed you. I'll take it up to the master. I'm accompanying him to the Minister's house, so I'll take it over for you. Make sure the rest of the work is done by tonight. I shall. Mohei? - Mohei? - Yes? How can I help you? Yesterday, you asked me about my family, didn't you? Yes... Well, there is a favour I'd like to ask of you. - Will you come with me? - Yes. It's humiliating having to talk to you about this... I understand. Your brother is going through hard times, like most businessmen are. How much does he require? He needs five kan of gold. What? I thought you were going to ask for 50 or even 100 kan! Not at all, but I dare not ask my husband for it. I've borrowed heavily from him ever since we were first married. I understand that, madam. I do all the accounts so I know. Just leave it to me. - I don't want you to get into trouble. - Please don't worry. It's just another way for me to be of service to the family of my master. I can easily come up with the amount. I knew I could rely on you, but I never thought you'd be able to help this much. - Thank you so much. Thank you. - Please, don't... Welcome home, sir. Welcome back. The Minister was very pleased with your work. Really? That's good. Are you feeling better? Don't tire yourself out now. I'm fine, thank you. You're the only one I can rely on to deal with the important jobs. Here are the calendars for the Imperial Palace, sir. Good, good. Also, I need your seal on a receipt for an order, sir. Yes, of course. Here, take it. MONEY ORDER SIGNED - ISHUN Mohei... what are you up to? You're back... - You look well. - What's this? I was just signing a receipt. But you've stamped the seal on a blank page. I need to take out an emergency loan of five kan of gold. I'll return it within 20 days. Just turn a blind eye, will you? What do you need it for? Listen, you and I have often done this for even larger amounts. That may be so, but we never stamped the master's seal on a blank page. I'd have told you beforehand if I could. Please, overlook it this once. Right, then. In that case, you can add another two kan for me. Sukeyemon, I'll pass that amount to you another way. Mohei, what you're doing is dangerous. If you're caught, you'll be had for fraud. Just think about that. Even if you are the favourite of the master and his wife. You're right. It was wrong of me. Very wrong. I'm going to apologise directly to the master. - Hold on. - What for? Just do what I asked of you. Mohei! - What's the meaning of this? - It's only five kan of gold. "Only" five kan? I don't care how trifling the amount, it's still my money! How dare you? Explain yourself! The simple reason is that I need the money. I can't just accept your excuses and forget about it. You owe your apprenticeship to me! Have you forgotten that? Do you need the money to pay off debts you owe to a geisha house? No, sir. You know that I would never frequent such places, sir. What's going on? - He misused the master's seal. - Master! If you refuse to speak, we'll let the authorities get the truth out of you! Master, it was I... Master, please forgive me! It was I who requested the money. A loan for what? Well... my uncle cannot survive as a masterless samurai, he's being pressured by his creditors and he's talking of suicide. That's the reason why I asked Mohei to help me. - You two seem awfully close. - Not at all, sir... You wouldn't do this if she was just a friend. Master! Mohei simply acted out of pity for Otama. I beg you to have mercy on him. Please forgive them. No! It's obvious, they're lovers! Sir, do with me as you will, but think of Otama, one day she will marry... Hey, Sukeyemon. Put Mohei in the storeroom. I'll hand you to the authorities tomorrow. And keep an eye on Otama. I'm going out. I'll be back later. Otama and Mohei would never do such a thing. This doesn't concern you! - Please forgive them. - Back to work, all of you! You should have listened to me. You've just thrown away all that you've worked so hard for. You know, in this day and age, how the master takes money off us to fund his own petty vices. And like a fool, you've just fallen into his trap! You idiot! - Don't take your eyes off him. - Yes, sir. Mohei. Madam sent this for you. - Madam did? - Yes. I see. Thank you. Madam... I'm not worthy to receive you in my room. I came to say thank you for before. This whole affair is my fault. Forgive me. Your fault, madam? Didn't you know? You are fond of Mohei, I can tell. Please... I will talk to the master and ask him to pardon you both. No, the master will never pardon us. WhV not? I do not wish to upset you, madam, and I wish to remain silent on the matter. But the truth is... the master... What about the master? He torments me constantly. He wants to set me up in a house so he can take advantage of me. To spare myself, I lied and told him that I was engaged to be married to Mohei. - That's why he's so angry with me. - What on earth...? To avenge himself, lam certain that he will come to visit me tonight. Here? To your sleeping quarters? Are you sure? YES, he has done so many times before. No... And he has the audacity to reproach others for their behaviour! He refuses to lend money to help his own flesh and blood and yet offers to buy you a house. Seems we're born into this world merely to labour. Aren't you awake yet? - Careful of the fire. - Yes, sir! Otama? Otama, it's me, Mohei. That was good of you to speak up before and spare madam any disgrace. Quiet, don't say anything. I intend to leave this house tonight for good. But I wanted to thank you first. Mohei... Madam? What are you doing here? Otama has probably told you... I feel like I've been completely let down. lam here to catch my husband out. I want to have a serious talk with him, and to save you and Otama. So Otama has told you everything? You wish to leave here, Mohei? Yes. Once I'm handed over to the authorities, I won't be able to find the money to help you. If I leave now, I can try to borrow the money for you. You're still thinking about that after all that's happened? I want to make amends for my mistake. Mohei, I will ask my husband to be lenient with you. Madam, it would do no good. I know the master well, he would never forgive me. I must leave. But I can't let you leave... when I am the cause of your misfortune. What are you doing, you fools? Wake up! Mohei's not here! Mohei! You idiots! Master! Master! Madam, please wake up! Madam! Madam, Mohei has escaped. Please get up. Madam? Otama? What are you doing here? - You mustn't go. - You mustn't stop me, madam. Go back to the storeroom and wait there until... - Enough, madam. - Please! Mohei. Wait, Mohei! Stop, Mohei! Stop! You've come to spend the rest of the evening with me, eh? Master! Master! - Something terrible has happened! - What is it? What do you mean, "something terrible"? Clear off, you lot! Please, you must believe me. I swear I'm not lying. Why should I believe you? Firstly, what were you doing in a servant's room? If you must know, I wanted to discuss something with you. And you would have been obligated to listen to me. Why couldn't you discuss it with me here? You just wanted to sleep with him! So, you refuse to listen to my explanation. There is nothing more to say. Osan! Osan... you know what someone of your rank must do now! Master! Master! - Master, where are you? - Ah, master. - Did you find him? - No, sir. - You searched all over? - Absolutely everywhere, sir. And not one of you found him? What should we do, sir? Well, you must tell no one... no one what happened this evening, understand? But we can't stop Mohei talking. Go to the authorities and file a complaint for the theft of my seal! I had a feeling he was planning something. And he's involved your wife in the whole thing, too, sir. And to think they'd been carrying on and nobody noticed a thing! Hold your tongue! Go tell the authorities, quick! What are you doing lagging behind? Get going! Osan! Osan! Osan? Madam? Mohei! What are you doing? I no longer want to remain in that house. Listen, madam... As his wife, I thought at least he'd trust me. I now realise what kind of a man he really is. Like a fool... I was completely ignorant until now. Madam... The master's accusation of adultery stems from a simple misunderstanding. He's impulsive and he's passed judgment too quickly. For tonight, it'd be better for you to go to your mother's house. - Let me take you there. - No, I don't want to go to my mother's. I just want to take myself far away from here. Don't say that. What about you? Where will you go? Well, I plan to go to Osaka. Osaka? I have to raise some money for your brother, and it would be easier to do if I went to Osaka. I shall go with you. You must take me. Impossible! If we do that, then people will surelyjudge us to be lovers! We'll be crucified. I see... You go, then. I'll find my own way somehow. Please, if you say that, you'll make it harder for me to leave. What should I do, then? Madam! Does the ship for Osaka leave from here? Yes, that's right. This is the first time I've ever spent a night in an inn. - It's so cold. - Yes. Excuse me. I've brought you some hot water. There you go. May I prepare your sleeping arrangements? Yes, please. How's your cold? My cold? It's completely disappeared, what with all the fuss. Hey, what are you doing? A single pillow will suffice. I won't be sleeping here. - Warm the room up well. - Yes, sir. Forgive me, I assumed that you'd be sleeping here. I must have been confused, sorry. Sorry. Goodnight. Mohei, I'm frightened. Stay here with me tonight. I couldn't possibly sleep in the same room as you, madam. Please, you must get some rest. Mohei... People's fate takes such strange turns, doesn't it? Even in a single day, we have been reduced to this. There's no one at fault. Let's worry about tomorrow when tomorrow comes. Just forget your worries and get some sleep. I'll try to get some sleep, too. Goodnight. Yes... goodnight. Not seeing him for a day Feels to me like a thousand days... The master harasses his managers about their accounts, but he lavishes expenses on us! Such expenses are but a drop in the ocean compared to the payoff he'll get in return. He's rich because he has a monopoly on the sale of calendars. If he can't find cause for celebration in that, then fortune will turn him old before his time. Today must be the best day of the year for this house. Otama, don't look so sad. You'll end up breaking your heart and what good will that do you? Listen, Madam and Mohei will surely return. You have to lift your spirits. All right? Ministers, honourable Chamberlain, lam deeply honoured by your visit to my humble home. This is a rare privilege for my family. You're always very generous. It is a pleasure to participate in the festivities with you. The delivery of the calendar is an auspicious day for you, and we are very happy to share in your good luck. Thank you, you are too good to me. - Master lsan has arrived, sir. - Oh, lsan? I appreciate you dropping by when you must be so busy. I stopped by to congratulate you on the publication of the latest calendar. Thank you very much. Please, won't you sit with us? May I present lsan, who printed the parchments for the retired Emperor? He deserves at least the same compliments that you bestow on me. lam honoured, gentlemen. Please, be seated. I notice that your wife isn't here. Yes... well... she went to visit her mother who's feeling poorly. That's a pity. It's been a long time. I was looking forward to seeing her lovely face. lsan, please accept a toast. Master... Excuse me for one moment, gentlemen. |shun's business is becoming more and more prosperous. On the other hand, though... officials in the royal household fall more and more heavily in his debt. lshun is very shrewd. If only I could be as half as clever as him. Many of the officials are at his mercy financially. I've heard it said that in Osaka recently the merchant Yodoya overstretched himself financially and ended up in bankruptcy. I heard that many samurai officials breathed a sigh of relief. Unfortunately, our Great Printer doesn't take such risks. He doesn't, you're right. Absolutely right. She's not hiding at Gifuya House, her mother's place. She must have eloped with him. Send men down every road out of town. Tell them, if they find them, bring back Osan alone. And what if the authorities arrest them first? They won't admit to adultery for fear of crucifixion. As the net closes in, they could be capable of anything. That's why you must act swiftly. - I want a quiet word. - This room is not fit to receive you, sir. I have a favour to ask you. Will you purchase this from me for eight kan of gold? It's a famous piece by Teika Fujiwara. You'll be able to sell it easily. - And I need the money right away. - Very well. - There you are, sir. - Many thanks. So it's true, after all? Nothing escapes your ears, master. If you don't act quickly, the reputation of this business will be ruined. But he's smart enough to get himself out of trouble. With help from his friends in high places, the status of a samurai. You really think that's possible? He hasn't informed the authorities, has he? He wouldn't dare. For the master... his reputation is more important than anything else. His business will collapse if those two adulterers are arrested. Listen, if this house's reputation is ruined, then the title of Great Printer will pass to me. At this moment, I have no successor. So... would you be interested? You mean that I will become a master printer and take your place? You don't want to remain an employee all your life, do you? The position is yours. Do we have an understanding? Thanks. You can go now. Welcome home, madam. Take this blessed talisman and place it on the altar. I compliment you on your singing voice. That delicate melody was beautiful. That's quite a talent you have, sir. My only talent is for hedonism. - Very droll, sir. - It's true. Thank you for visiting us. Not at all, madam. The number of students I teach nowadays is getting fewer and fewer. It's an absolute pleasure coming here to teach your son. It feels like paradise to me, being here! It feels like hell to me sometimes! You may not be coming round much more from now on. Go safely. "Hell"? What do you mean, "it's hell"? Each day, I live frugally and pray to the gods. You don't give a damn about anything! I know it's pointless to try and fight the creditors. You're just weak-willed. I don't know what else I can do. I realise that I'm going to be arrested. My sister has decided to leave her husband and elope with her lover. Our home and all our valuables will be confiscated. That completes the fall of the House of Gifuya, doesn't it, Mother? I refuse to believe whatever lshun the Great Printer says. Osan is incapable of ever committing such a crime. What are you talking about, Mother? It all started when you forced Osan into marriage with a man 30 years her senior. I did what I had to, to save the House of Gifuya. If Osan has run away, then it must be for some other reason. It would have been easier if she'd just killed herself. Master? Master? Master... What is it? The courier just delivered this package. It's from Osaka. - You may go now. - Yes, sir. And this... Mother, this has arrived from Osan. "In the hope of saving you, "I have borrowed money from an acquaintance. "I am sending you the five kan of gold that you requested." Look, Mother, look, it's money! "Please believe none of the rumours and lies "that you have no doubt heard about me. "Brother, I ask of you, please, to take good care of our mother. "Your loving sister, Osan." May the gods be praised! What's she doing in Osaka? Thank you, Osan. Osan! - ls it an inspection? - Yes. I wonder what it's all about? - They're not here, sir. - Very well. You can go. Thank you, sir. - Pilgrims in our group can pass through. - What's that about? They're looking for the wife of the Great Printer of Kyoto. Let's pass through. In here! - Not here? - No. But he was with a woman, right? But she wasn't dressed like the wife of such an eminent man. There are serious charges of forgery and adultery against them. That's why we have strict orders to apprehend them. Search everywhere! They must be nearby! The master must have filed a complaint with the authorities. What shall we do? It's impossible for us to get to Kyoto now. We'll have to head to Lake Biwa instead. What do we do once we get to the lake? How far can we run with the authorities on our trail? - This is the only place to hide! - They're not here! - Return to the main highway! - Yes, sir! I would rather die than suffer the shame of being arrested. Madam, what are you saying? - It's definitely them, no mistake? - Yes, sir. In there. Good. Excuse me, an inspector is here. Your names? My name is Kyubei. And this is my sister Tami. Residing in Tenma, Osaka. - You say your name is Kyubei? - Yes. Why are you here? We're just passing through. I see. It must be them. I'll stay and guard them. You go quickly to the magistrate's. Hey, go as quickly as you can. We've been discovered. We have to leave. I can't keep running away. I don't want to be a fugitive. I can't live a life of shame. Mohei... let me die, I'm begging you. Please... Please... We have to leave now. Madame Osan... are you ready? Because of me... you are now being forced to give up your life. Can you ever forgive me? What are you saying, madam? It has given me great pleasure to serve you, madam. I can say it now... The heavens won't punish me if I am unable to hold back these last words. I have always... I have always... I have always loved you, madam. - Loved me? - Yes. Please... hold me. Hold me tight. Madame Osan... What have you resolved to do? Forgive me. Forgive me. After what you've just said... it changes everything. What do you mean? I no longer want to die. I want to live! Mohei! - Did you call for me, Master? - Come in. Listen closely... I want you to go to Katada immediately to find their cadavers. I've just been informed that they drowned themselves in Lake Biwa. A double suicide... sir? It's imperative that you keep this secret. If you find them, separate Osan's body from Mohei‘s. It would be terrible if their bodies were found together. Understand? Now go quickly. - Just imagine, a double suicide! - Really? Isn't that just a rumour? No, someone saw them jump into the lake, arm in arm. What's wrong, Otama? You're just jealous of madam running away with Mohei. "l am so jealous of you, madam!" Be quiet! Leave me alone. Don't separate the cadavers if they are intertwined, right? Remove them carefully, just as they are, understand? Don't separate them, understand? Beautiful day, isn't it? Are you heading for Kyoto? I'm going to stay the night in Saga at my daughter's house. - Oh, I see. Well, have a good trip. - Thank you. - Can we just rest here a while? - For as long as you wish. - What's the matter with her? - She hurt her leg while walking. Her leg? Oh, she's sprained it all right. Poor thing, it must be hard for her on this road. I have a good remedy for her. Thank you, that's very kind of you. Can we make it down to the village before nightfall? That's still a long way to go. Come and rest, madam. I will ask if they'll take us in for the night. It's hard for you at this high altitude. Would it be possible for us to stay here this evening? Of course, of course. I'll just get that medicine for you. We're in luck. Just bear with it a little longer. I'll wash your feet for you. I wish I could attend to my hair, it must be filthy. I'm sorry you have to suffer all these indignities. I must apologise to you for being such a nuisance and injuring my leg. But I'm happier than I've felt for a long time. Honestly, I feel so happy. According to the notice posted up in Saga, it's only me that the authorities are searching for. I think that the master will be more lenient towards you. Stop talking like that. This ointment will numb all the pain in your foot. - Let me see your ankle. - Thank you. Where does it hurt? Let's have a look. What elegant feet you have. So where are you heading? We're going to see the statue of Manjushri at Kirido. Oh, that sounds very nice. Does it hurt just there? Where has the gentleman gone? Mohei! Why are you running away? How can you be so cruel to abandon me like that? I have caused you so much misfortune. Please forgive me. Osan... You must go back to your husband. He will welcome you with open arms. I'm begging you to return to him. You really think that I can go on living without you? You are no longer my servant... you are my husband, my master! I'm sorry for what I said, I'm sorry. I will never leave you again, for the rest of my life! I live as a masterless samurai and I refuse to rely on my niece for money. But I regret that she has caused you so much trouble by lying to you because of her foolish love for Mohei. Otama, make your valedictions. I thank you for your generosity over the years. You didn't take the blame when you were brought before the master. - All of this is your fault. - Please forgive her. I'll take that for you. - Otama, write to me, won't you? - Take care of yourself. Take care. Excuse me! I am the chestnut merchant, I call by once a year. Would you like to buy some? You caught me by surprise. Madam isn't here. You'll have to come back later. Madam isn't here? Then it really was her I saw. - You saw her? - Really? I caught a glimpse of her in Saga, at the foot of Mount Atago. - Was she alone? - No. - Was she with an employee? - Yes, that's right. What a state of affairs. This is going to cause me so much trouble. Master! Master! They're still alive, both of them. They're not dead. A woodsman saw them yesterday at the foot of Mount Atago. - Alive? - Yes. That means they must be going to Mohei's father's place. You must track them down. Bring back only Osan. Leave Mohei down there and let the village authorities deal with him. I understand. So, they're alive... Who's there? It's me. - Who? - It's me. Father! I don't know you. It's me, Mohei. My son is no bandit pursued by the authorities. Have the authorities already been here? Think of the trouble you'll cause the villagers by being here! You should have remained loyal to your master instead! Mohei, let's go. But we've come all this way. There's a cabin at the back for passing travellers, you can use that. Go quickly! You can rest here. Madame Osan... we won't be given refuge in this place. I think you're right. You can stay here, but you must leave before dawn. I'm sure there must be some good reason for your flight, but don't let yourselves be arrested before my eyes. Eat this quickly. Here. I've prepared something for you to eat tomorrow. Madame Osan... As a child, I would often come here... and daydream about going to Kyoto to make my fortune. What a beautiful dream it was. I would be so happy if I could live here with you in peace forever. Genbeﬂ Come inside. As I explained to you yesterday, you can be arrested as an accomplice for hiding Mohei. Some people are certain that they saw them on the road. They both must be here. Don't deny it. The entire village will be punished otherwise. How can you lie and let us all be punished? You have your tenant farm thanks to the Great Printer. The master is now burdened by worry because of what your son has done. ls this how you show your thanks to your benefactor? I will beg the master to forgive Mohei. Just be honest and tell me if the madam is here. Don't you feel guilty for betraying the master like this? You're no better than an animal! Please forgive me. - They're here, then? - Yes. Madam, please wake up. - What are you doing? - Madam! Come quietly, madam. Come quietly. Mohei! I gaze at the blossoms The spirit of Spring... If she returns to your household, we can make up a suitable pretext for her, whatever Mohei says. - Isn't that right? - Yes. Thank you so much. If you could say that she's been at her mother's house all along... - Very well. - In return, do me that favour... Say no more. Your name has already been struck from my register. ls that so? Perhaps our debts may be cleared in return for your peace of mind? Very droll, sir. Your rival, lsan, is spreading malicious rumours concerning this matter. He's saying that your wife has a lover. Eh? ls that true, sir? After the master has looked after him for so long, that wretch pays him back with such treachery. Enough, enough! Thank you for your loyalty, gentlemen. Thank you for listening. - It was splendid, thank you. - Thank you, sir. I am indebted to you for showing such kindness towards my sister. I always have. But the important lesson to learn is that one should always marry a loyal woman. - Please accept a toast. - Thank you. Thank you, sir. Father, set me free, please! I can't die like this. If you escape, then what will you do? Even if you were free, you'd never be able to live with the master's wife! Stop talking such rubbish! - You don't understand how I feel. - I'm happier that way! Here. Tomorrow the Kyoto authorities will come for you. ls that true? Yes. What have I done to deserve such a son? You ungrateful fool! Make sure you don't do anything shameful, understand? Get going! Please don't cause your mother any more upset. If you don't return to your husband, where will you go, then? He's forgiven you, instead of killing you along with your lover! If it happens again, it will be the end of you! Don't be too severe with her. Your mother understands very well what you're going through. But listen... Mohei has been arrested. I'm not telling you that for the sake of your marriage or your family, but because you must forget all about him and go back to your husband for your own good. I went to see lshun and did everything I could to intercede on your behalf. Do you realise that? You will return to your husband and that's that! You will return immediately! Do you understand that? Immediately! Mohei... - Mohei! - Osan... Osan! Madam... I know I shouldn't have come... No, you shouldn't. And this is no place to discuss it. Come into the house. Come inside. Mohei, I can't believe you escaped. Yes. I gave up hope of ever seeing you again. No matter what happens to us, I never want to leave your side. I will never leave you! It isn't much... but here's some warm sake to comfort you. Please forgive my intrusion. Listen, Mohei, you've taken a great risk coming here. What are you going to do now? Your unbridled passion is making the situation impossible. Yes... At least you've seen each other once more... you can be happy. But now, Mohei, it's best that you leave Kyoto at once. I have something for you. It's not much but please take it for the journey. Mother, I won't let Mohei leave alone! What are you saying? Are you trying to ruin both your husband and our house? You didn't come here with that intention, did you, Mohei? I came here to find Osan Don't be so foolish! You fools! Doki! Doki! Mohei, you must give yourself up to the authorities. That way everyone will be saved. Please, do it for Osan! I'm begging you. Mohei, please! Mohei! Mohei! I want to give myself up... but I can no longer do so. Where's Mohei? In there? - Mother, they've gone! - No! - Osan? - They've escaped! - Sukeyemon! - Osan! They can't have got far. Quick! Ah, Master lshun, did you know that Mohei has been arrested? Arrested ? And they say that your wife was with him. - Osan? - Yes. They wanted to bring her here, but she refused to leave Mohei's side. They say that they've both confessed to adultery. She's confessed to adultery. They also say that you failed to inform the authorities about her elopement. I can understand your leniency towards her, your wife is very beautiful. Master! Master! Master, the government envoys are here! Welcome them courteously. Master lsan, you must forgive me, I'm slightly overcome by it all. I'm sorry to be the bearer of such bad news. Come inside! "You are hereby informed that the Great Printer lshun, "having deliberately abstained from informing "on the adulterous affair between his wife and employee Mohei, "is sentenced to exile plus confiscation of all his chattels." To think, a house so mighty brought to its knees like this! The master has been exiled, and even Sukeyemon has been banished. - Unbelievable. - It's like a nightmare. Tell me, why did Sukeyemon receive such a punishment? He'd made a fortune from forging the master's accounts. Good riddance to the two of them, they had to go. It's the procession of the condemned! Make way! - Move! - Out of the way! It's so sad. She must be suffering so much. I have never seen the Madame look so joyful, though. Mohei, as well... his expression is so serene. It's hard to imagine that they're on their way to die.
