[Shorty] I am Shorty, a shipboard computer of what’s left of the Misanthrope. Some three years ago the Misanthrope crashed on an uncharted planet amongst the local free worlds. Pascal, the last captain of the Misanthrope was marooned along with me. This is the story of our final voyage. Since I cannot predict effects of ongoing memory damage, I want to get this on the record while I still can. The ship was heading for the planet Bogar of the Free Worlds. Where Pascal could retire in modest comfort. [dramatic music] [alarm beeping] [Shorty] Pascal, we have a problem! Pascal we have a problem! Pascal! ♪ Da, da, da, da Da, da, da, da ♪ [Pascal coughing] What? Aft scanners indicate we are perused by an alien battleship that I tentatively identified previously. When last we spoke of this you rather constructively decided to become inebriated and pass out. What's your next move commander? We're waiting Pascal, any time you're ready. [Pascal singing] ♪ Early to Bed ♪ ♪ And early to rise ♪ ♪ Makes a man healthy Wealthy and wise ♪ [thump] [Shorty] Ah yes, some calisthenics at oh seven hundred Try and stick to the problem Pascal. The battleship is closing in on our starboard hull, kindly look at the monitor. [Pascal] Relax Shorty. It's just another cowboy hauling grow dung from one shit-hole world to another. Not to worry. [Shorty] You'd be pleased to know that I am programmed to worry. When you left the military did you also leave your senses? What is your next move? [Pascal] Coffee. [Shorty sighs] [Shorty] That's a fine move sir. Let's sit this one out, why don't we and pour ourselves a steaming hot mug of aromatic santhese. I mean, I like a man who doesn't panic. The time for evasive action is growing short. Pascal, are you listening to me? They say that all light in the universe is old light. [Shorty] Oh, no! For that reason we see the past when we look at the stars, [Shorty] Pascal, it is still possible for you to save the Misanthrope. Not so Shorty. It's destiny reflected. We're dust. It will suck us up along with everything else that never mattered. It will swallow us all and then the great greedy will swallow itself. Then everything that ever was... never was. Put that in your star log buddy. [Shorty] Pascal, I'm detecting an energy buildup aboard the alien vessel. There's a high probability, the ship is preparing to attack. [Pascal] I don't get it. I don’t get it. What do they want, from me? Our cargo is not worth the fuel it takes to push it. Even so, we're followed to the empty margins of the universe. [Shorty] My review of the cargo manifest confirms your opinion Pascal, energy readings indicate a pre-firing mode. Right Shorty, listen up. Give me a hundred and eighty degrees. [Shorty] Confirmed sir. -Plot inverting spiral. -[Shorty] Course plotted. Engage randomizing laterals. [Shorty] Program engaged. [Pascal] Advise me of incoming fire on the vector grid. [Shorty] Defensive matrix program engaged. What's that? Either it's a planet, or you've just discovered the first blue hole. Thanks a lot Shorty. [Shorty] No harm in a little levity under pressure. Wait a second. Let's use its shadow. [Shorty] Pascal if you are contemplating a sling shot maneuver I must point out that this ship no longer has the structural integrity... Incoming fire at seventy two degrees! Pascal, Pascal! Use that planetary momentum Shorty, in for the tight curve, hug the horizon then whoosh. Slingshot, blow cargo for cover. Home free! [Shorty] Alien plasma impact in 30 seconds. -Power? -[Shorty] Increasing! -Power! -[Shorty] Power threshold... Power! Fuck! [Shorty] You cannot comply. [Pascal] The bitch must! No, no Shorty, make her. [Shorty] Auxiliary power boost and override? [Pascal] Now! Alien plasma at 15 seconds and closing. All right, grab it short hairs. Slingshot, confound them, blow cargo bays. Negative on cargo bay detonation. Blow back-ups then. Negative. Back up system failure. Alien plasma at five and closing, four, three, two, one. [crash] No! Damage report: Main drive failure, atmospheric reflection, sub orbital speed and declining I am trying to restart engines. Planetary impact inevitable. Extending decline capacity. Pascal, acknowledge! Pascal! Exterior hull rupture. Sealing off hull. Pascal, please acknowledge! Restart failure and flying off vectoring rockets only. Approaching planetary surface. Nothing matters anymore. I'm free. I'm free. [engine whirring] [static noise] [Shorty] We could not know at the time that another vessel was watching from a safe distance. The Miranda, the flagship of the Motherhood. A matriarchy which dominates the local free worlds. Pascal, once worked for The Motherhood. On the bridge is the man he once worked for, Admiral Hardman, Supreme Commander of the Motherhood forces. Beside him is the clairvoyant, Major Charlie Vault. Clairvoyants are supposed to keep Mothers military in line. Vault was sent to investigate Admiral Hardman whose loyalty had been questioned. However the good Admiral has turned Vault into his ally. Amazing. Aliens haven’t floated strategic hardware in a 100 years. [Charlie] It's a power play, an obvious ploy. Let's get it over with. [Shorty] Ah yes, the aliens. All cultures need an enemy so the Motherhood chose them. Aliens are users of the drug Horizon. A drug formed from interstellar dust. Aliens are human descendants of a religious colony. Horizon has the effect of repressing their desire to communicate. So their leadership found the drug convenient to impose spiritual obedience on their followers. Horizon made them alien to our minds. Aliens defied the Motherhood. And now they surface with strategic class hardware. And now Captain, you're going to intercept and destroy them... with your usual impressive efficiency. [console bleeping] [dramatic music] [Pascal shivering] That's one way to slow down a ship. [Shorty] Given that I found us the only piece of land on this planet, I'd say I performed with adequate effectiveness. [Pascal] If you don't mind atomizing the pilot. [Shorty] We still exist, do we not? I always wanted a holiday by the sea. [Shorty] I activated the automatic distress signal just before impact. I estimate the signal propagated for 13.2 seconds. There is a 47% probability that the signal will reach another vessel within an effective rescue range. There won't be a rescue. [intriguing music] [Shorty] Above us the Miranda was entering orbit around Pascal's planet. Set up your own courier. That's not your usual style Hardman. It's only logical Vault. Aliens were getting stronger. My personal position was threatened. I needed a provocation. Anyways. Anyways, anyways he set himself up. Someone in particular? Pascal? You didn't! Yes. Yes. Yes, I did boy. He's as good as dead then. Out of your mind, I don't want to hear about him anymore. This means what? You knew aliens had a battleship. No, but it was a lot of Horizon. I wanted to draw out their big guns. You did that all right. Bad move setting up Pascal for the raid. He's a powerful negative force in your patterns Hardman. Your shadow. He's dead! He was... he was powerless. Asshole died. [Shorty] A disconnection from my ship-board circuitry, I find myself strangely underemployed. I feel as if I have got too much time on my hands. I need a sense of purpose! Perhaps I can make myself useful of solving the mystery of why the alien battleship attacked us. The risk of reprisal by the Motherhood is not consistent with alien behavior. The only reasonable deduction is that The Misanthrope had something onboard that the Aliens wanted. On the other hand the cargo manifest revealed nothing of particular value to the aliens. Pascal, what is your input? I repeat Pascal. What is your input? Cut me deep Shorty. Play me something that will break my spine. [Shorty] I don’t think we have it. Lyrical enough to suck brains through this old hands nose and death wrap me like an ancient Egyptian before Ra. Pascal, just what would it take to stop this orgy of self-pity? Just play me something I can't stand. [Shorty] Very well. [country music plays] ♪ I see her smiling face on the Streets and everywhere ♪ ♪ If the phone should ring I'll get it ♪ ♪ Just hoping she'll be there ♪ ♪ This motel that I'm a crashing Ain't no Holiday Inn ♪ ♪ It's a hell of a place And a mess that I'm in ♪ ♪ But She's gone Yeah she's gone ♪ I'm hungry. [Shorty] The ships food re-hydrator is in a state of permanent disrepair. Pascal, feed thyself. Okay Mother! I surrender. Mom! Mommy! [Shorty] Look on the bright side Pascal. We seemed to have escaped The Motherhood. That is what you've always wanted. Still I wonder why we were attacked. There's no accounting for the random violence in the universe Shorty. That's the nature of things. I am too old Shorty. Too old, tell Mother I’ve changed. It’s over. Early to bed, early to rise. I like it. I’ll sing it in the maternal choir. Now! I’ve changed. Honest to fuck! Just one good thought. God please, just one. One good thought. Just youngsters slaughtered. Fools ambition. Ass head. Now it's my turn. Not slaughtered. Just nibbled away. Picked clean to nothing. To nothingness. Perchance to dream. Aye, there’s the rub. [Shorty] You did your job Pascal, so did your crew. There’s no need for further self-blame. Like all humans, you have a fondness for rumination. So what else is new? The universe is spinning. Spinning. Spinning… [fire crackling] It's over. [gasps] What a dream I had Shorty. [Shorty] A dream. About what? Fire. [Shorty] I know Pascal, it’s your sickness. Oh, I’m sick? [Shorty] Yes, Pascal. [ominous music] Shorty! [Shorty] Relax Pascal. It’s just a dream. How can you tell? [Shorty] Trust me. Sleep Pascal, rest. Mother says the aliens and their drug silent addiction to a god they’ve forgotten are a threat to decency in the universe. Well I’ve never liked fanatics myself. Compromise is the way. Moderation in all things, except art. That’s what I think. So we’re going to prove these horizon adjusting fanatics can’t build a battleship and get away with it. Lucky. Lucky. Lucky. No thrill like intimacy with the enemy. [Shorty] Good morning. How are you feeling my friend? You were tossing and turning all night. [coughs] I think I’m coming down with something. [Shorty] Indeed you are Pascal. You’re suffering from delirium due to exposure. Shorty, I need… [Shorty] I am programmed to respond to the inflection patterns in your speech. If I am reading the tone correctly, you now desire a contraband substance. I recall the time we smuggled Gene-co Kinetic Resonators into the Evangelical Colony. I remember that. Freedom world. Sex plus guilt equals control. A small blow against the Motherhood. [Shorty] I believe you referred to it as a blow job against the Motherhood and three weeks later they brought you up on charges of misogyny. Misogyny? They were so wrong Shortcakes. Never wronger. I resent only the banality of predictable behavior. It would be the same in any culture. Mine happens to be the Motherhood. You did scream rather loudly when the deputies took you away. I was still married then. Dorothy backed me up too. She was great. [Shorty] But, you left her. We were becoming predictable. No one's to blame. You’re getting me off topic here Shorty. I need you to do an enviro- physiological diagnostic on me. I’d love to oblige but half my wires are severed. I can’t guarantee proper access routing. [typing] [Shorty] Confidential file. No, no, no. Not psychological profile… [Shorty] Restricted access. Command eyes only. Stop now. Exit file. What a minute. [Shorty] Captain Pascal. Psychological profile. Testimony sources, military, civil and personal. First witness, Human Resources Officer Adrian Flowers. Era Danny Star lines. [Adrian] I am Adrian Flowers. Human Resources Officer for Era Danny Star lines. We engaged Captain Pascal as a staff pilot. On the first day of June 2124. He was let go the same day. I have nothing to add. [Dorothy] Pascal wasn't family inclined. Not even from the beginning. We never pretended that. I wanted a child. My child. [Pascal] That was a long time away in space. [Dorothy] We always told the truth. That was our deal. It worked. That's the way it goes. [Hardman] Don't judge Pascal. We're surrounded by fanatics. The Aliens, the Motherhood. What? You defend the Motherhood. Horizon? Horizon is repression. Silence. Its dealers are my enemies. But doesn’t The Motherhood also deny freedom? Who is our enemy Pascal? Doesn’t The Motherhood also offend humanity? We’ve become prisoners unto ourselves. But I will create visionary nations by shattering two degenerate ones. What’s your plan, sir? The Motherhood will emerge triumphant over alien power. Yet... and this is perfect. Somewhere very near the jaws of victory, the Motherhood will devour itself, dealing Horizon. Dealing as common pus. Like the architects of the tower of babel. I plan the inevitability of destruction, in the fabric of success. You are slaughtering innocents in pursuit of a great speech. You object, but you know I am right. Damn it Pascal! I have the power, the vision. You must stand by me. Lay your hands, on the reigns of destiny. You’re the only one who can understand. The only one who can share vision. Don’t let me down. Pascal. [fire crackling] [mysterious music] Hardman wake up. What is it? The hiccup in the firmament A dissonant note in the music of the spheres. Oh for god sakes Charlie Vault talk English. A call from the dead. He is very smart. You suppose… He defies again the odds. He? Not a weapon on board, yet still he chooses to fight. His maneuvers can’t help him. On the contrary they cast his ship into planetary gravity inviting, one reasons… certain destruction. His ship races towards a predictable end. Yet he regains control seconds before impact. In those moments a distress signal. A plea for help, betrays the Misanthrope. Pascal! He’s brilliant, the devil. I taught him everything he knows. His distress signal tells the story in light speed. Doesn’t the music of the universe ever tire your brain? He could still be alive, he might be. Doesn’t matter. It means they didn’t recover the Horizon. [console bleeping] Awake Pascal, being right isn’t substitute for affection. All our friends said I was such an asshole because of what I left behind. I do regret some things. My son. I don’t blame you. It's no one's fault. It's just that time has a wonderful way of shifting guilt around. [Russian accent] Still so bitter Pascal. The fire... singed their hair clean. Revealing them to be grotesque babes in death. I remained resolved, doing it because belief in the war and the Motherhood. Hardman later said the difference in what side of the war you were on was only a matter of theater. Easy for him, he gets the nice costume. Zetio. First Officer saint. Angel she is... warns me that maybe Hardman is less than he seems. Oh no I say. The Admiral is okay. The Admiral will deliver us. I tell Zetio. What side of the war? What side of what for? What side of the bed? What side your bread is buttered upon? Horizon. Horizon. Horizon. In weightlessness... the blood forms into little spheres. Floating little balloons. It was a party time on board the Corvette Hamilton. Later I learned that even as we fought to rid The Motherhood of Horizon, the under-decks of my Corvette were fairly packed with the damn shit. Hey! The good Admiral had been dealing to the enemy. I know this sort of thing is not unique in human history, but its uncommonly negative when it happens to you. Disappointed... I confront the good Admiral. He says, some blah blah. Real freedom manifests in the dynamic rupture between powers. His idea... maybe. But a moral monolith, I messiah come lately, owe it to my crew to find some meaning in the decrepit tale that was their death. Too bad. Not a chance. Nothing deeper hidden. So... so, so. I go to Mother, investigate this guy! Leave the Admiral alone everyone says. Don’t judge. Work hard, play hard they say. Everything was all right until you came along, they say. Not his fault sings the chorus. Who are you to throw the first stone? So crew died. Don’t you wash your blame in accusation of a proven loyal officer. Hey. I took them all on. For a while. But Admiral 'God' Hardman, has a very long arm. Even under investigation every mission assigned is destined to martyr me. I know that Hardman is scared now. But... even as he tries to kill me, I full knowing... miss the vengeful motherfucker. So I get too old to care, being antisocial was a habit by then. But all that was years ago, relative to where you are on the curve of light. [console bleeping] I want to examine the crash site. It's absurd. A battleship vulnerable during atmospheric maneuvers. Xaxx. You’re afraid. No, the good Captain is right. I’ll take the shuttle. Xaxx might be too squeaky clean, but you should listen. Putrefaction. Xaxx? She’s right. It’s a hell of a risk taking the shuttle. Don’t expose yourself on the basis of a petty vendetta. The Horizon is worth recovering Charlie Vault. Let’s say he is alive. If so what then? Will you finish him Hardman? Let nature do it. Let him go. [Pascal] First rule of human behavior Shorty. The reason we do it all, to keep the party going. I mean never ever break the illusion that it's all okay. People hate you when you do that. Hey up there. It's show-time folks! Hey honey, we’re out of beer again. [Russian accent] You mean, you’re out of beer again. [Russian accent] I don’t even like beer. Right. I take you into my home, you piss on my rug. Hey is this a party or what? I’ve seen you Pascal, it's self-destructive behavior. It’s bad for you, it’s bad for me, it’s bad for business. You’re fucked boy, bye bye. [Shorty] You feel better now Pascal? I don’t need any of you. I don’t need your god damn safety nets, your vulgar masks, squeaky clean safe sex conversations, TV Sundays, locked the door, love nest, cash is the answer. Sex plus guilt is control. Motherhood menagerie. [Shorty] Very well Pascal. Expunge the evil from your past, but rejecting those who care about you serves little purpose. [Dorothy] Don't need us Pascal? Fine... you took on the forces. A Lord Admiral no less. Then rage bloody minded and get angry at all authority. For flex the rules. Seems I was too strong for you then. It seems I had the wide shoulders then. It seems we had friends then, for what? To prove all are forsaken in the end? Right Pascal? All dead. Jesus Pascal. That is pathetic. Yeah. Jesus Pascal. That's me the fucking messiah. You mean give an inch Pascal, you would have had it all. Now it seems to give an inch. [Dorothy] Poor Pascal. Never accepted halfway measures. You believed in the system and death turned you back. That was your ticket. Not to believe in anything at all. A noble choice. High road is no road Pascal. Pascal, that's something you never... That's something you never understood. He is making sense. I am naked honey. Ideals are nothing compared to loyalty. Right. Ideals are always corrupted. Loyalty has a chance. A toast to the Motherhood... and all the emotional disorders stored in the family closet. [Shorty] Warning! Warning! Alien vessel. Help me. Alien attack! Alien attack! Aliens draining my power unit. Alien attack! Alien attack! [distorted signal] Shorty! [Shorty] Pascal! [sparks] [engine droning] [wind blowing] Pascal? I’ve come to take you home. Hey Pascal, you got even. You equalized it. [Charlie] Hardman, what are you doing? We a plant. [Charlie] Get what you came for and leave. You get it. I warned you. Let him go. [Hardman] Jesus Pascal. The curve of light speed leaves you younger than me. But you are the very mathematic of decline. The mathematical messiah. You owe me boy. [radio] Attention Admiral Hardman we have observed tactical movement on the alien ship. Please return to Miranda. Right. Die Here! [shuttle engines] [sad music] [console bleeping] In the war years I learned how each alien spy develops personality and predictability, but it takes time. Time I don’t think the admiral has. Something else, you’ve noticed repertoire between Hardman and the Intelligence Officer. It's not our business. In any event nobody wants to lay charges in an investigation in what took place during a war everyone wants to forget. Agreed. We don’t know that the admiral was ever guilty of anything. [announcer] Battleship launch event from alien vessel. Fighter closing on planetary atmosphere. [announcer] Admiral Hardman please attend the bridge. Shit. What do they want? [announcer] An alien fighter admiral. Request clearance to fire. Very well. I’m coming. Shit. Alien fighter in scanner. Nobody wins. Lock in fire. [alarm] [crash] Jackpot. I ask ya, what are the odds? What are the odds of something like this happening? [imitates snare hit] You don’t look like you’re from anywhere that I know of but then I don’t know everyone from everywhere, so… I’ll just keep talking to myself if you don’t mind. You let me know if I am making any sense okay? Are you really here? Or is it just my poor addled brain out there flashing an image of a woman who refuses to talk to me. Hey! [Pascal exclaims] Hello. Are you an alien? Of course you're alien. Nobody else here fits the description. I mean who else but an alien would look right over someone's head into the clouds when someone's asking a question? Territory. Yours and mine. That’s just fine by me. I met a man from your world once, only once. Very old, aged from the high end of light curve, he was preserved from the day before your people were Alien. We were drinking. I come from another world he says. Don’t we all I say. No. you don’t understand. He’s looking at me with these luminous eyes, like he’s saying to impress me that he means it. They don’t talk there, no words Words are illegal, language is anguish. Fanatics Captain Pascal, you’ve never seen fanatics. I joke that he should meet Hardman. They decided he says... that truth lies only in action. Words subvert, twist, pervert And because words substitute for life lived, they make us unreliable, amoral, tempted by the change we foment on the ledge of consciousness. He grabs my arm tight, I was 14 years old, on that day a whole planet just shut up. That’s all. Now I wouldn’t believe a story like that. But then how could I disbelieve it. So, you see I knew your great great granddaddy way back when you people were human, and bullshit artists like the rest of us. Good night. Sweet dreams. Dorothy come to bed. [mysterious music] [console bleeps] [Hardman] It’s growing stronger. I don’t know why. [Charlie] Because Pascal distracted you. But they’re here for a reason. And yet, I will destroy them. I assure it very soon Vault. I bought your beautiful dream Hardman. A man who could get his hands dirty to build something new. I can support that. I appreciate it. But here we are. No dynamic rupture Hardman. Are you waiting for the right moment? Or are you just another illusion, another fake? Are you perhaps, just what you seem? Talking dreams to justify petty evil. Perhaps Hardman, I should have done my job. Perhaps I should call off this mission and continue Mother's investigation. I would never let you down Charlie. Okay Hardman. Prove it. [happy music] [music continues] Hey alien. You. [Pascal] There are two things I like about you. The thing I like the most about you is you don’t have anything to say. Let's just say, I was born into a circumstance of disappointing human reference. Yeah, the feeling is mutual guys. Anyhow, where I'm from people always have something to say. It’s a real pain. Some guy always unloading his burden of intelligence. Now personally I find burden enough attending to the basic chemical imperatives. That's a real burden. Sex is the worst one. It makes you stupid. Intelligence just withers in pursuit of sex. I’m talking men here right. Guys just do the stupidest things in the universe for sex. Not women. Women don’t do stupid things for sex. Women do stupid things for relationships. Yeah, I’m generalizing, that's what Dorothy would say. Anyhow. I look around figure out what I can, to establish the rules for survival right? What else can a guy hope to do? I started to say the things I liked about you, there were two right? One, two, oh yeah. The other thing I like about you, I get the impression you want to slit my throat. Now what's nice about that is, you never tried to pretend that it isn’t true. God damn a guy could learn to like that in a person. The thing that pisses me off about you, one, you’re trying to slit my throat, and two, I don’t know what you’re doing here. Wouldn’t care to fill me in on that hey? [laser noises] Not again. Not them again. No! No. Animals, fucking animals! It’s okay. Yeah. Betrayal hurts. [chimes clinking] [inspiring music] Power? Okay Shorty. Let's take this one step at a time. I gave up Shorty. Not like Hardman. The guys a paragon of a paradigm, he knows my parameters so well he uses me after he used me. I ought to have done something about that. [chimes clinking] [Shorty] Shorty, is that your name now? Shorty. [Shorty] That is my name not yours. [Shorty chattering] Did you feel any pain? [Shorty] No pain… no gain Pascal. Self-improvement is so very good for the spirit. [Shorty] He’s back and he’s better than ever! [chattering] [Shorty] There is an alien female present. Why I can see again brother. My scanning ability has been restored. I am now receiving telemetry from an indefinite range. There is an alien female present. Scanning alien female. Warning Pascal, the alien is carrying a knife. Take evasive action immediately. Evidently I have much input to catch up on, this encounter requires further analysis. Aha, both the alien battleship and the female’s escape pod possess the same technology. Analysis of alien female now available. Physiology indicates human origin, however magnetic resonance scan of the cerebral hemispheres shows only rudimentary development of the females expressive speech processing service. The female is incapable of oral communication. The data suggests the female has been habituated to the drug Horizon since birth. Shit. That’s it. Eat it up you fucking barbarian. [evocative music] [console bleeping] No. No. No! There are too many officers who never got their hands dirty. Too many politicians looking to hang a military man. [Charlie] They can’t hang you Hardman. You’re a fucking magician. Only I can do that. They’ll burn me the next time some pathetic fuck up finds Horizon in a coffee bag. I’m grateful the Motherhood sent such a visionary woman to keep an eye on me. [strange music] Horizon on the Misanthrope Shorty. [Shorty] Yes I know Pascal, another victory for the Motherhood. Renders the art of humiliation in rather grand strokes doesn’t it? [Shorty] Pardon me? There’s Horizon on board. [Shorty] Which provides a reason for her presence. And it’s not just obsession that keeps dragging bits of Hardman through my damaged brain. I took a look at her wreck Shorty, she sustained enemy fire before crashing. [Shorty] And what's your point? We may be abandoned on this rock Shortcakes... but the local universe is more crowded than we thought. I will scan the upper atmosphere for any spacecraft. Damn. [console bleeping] [muttering] [Hardman] Captain Xaxx! Now is the time for the dynamic rupture. Time to kill the enemy. Admiral, this is not the right choice. It's growing stronger and from what I can see… This is what she saw! It's your fault. Your cowardice killing us but I will not let it happen. I will destroy the enemy, now! There is no option for delay! [Shorty] I have just completed my sensor scan Pascal. And I have discovered two space craft in this sector. One is the alien vessel which attacked us and the other is the Motherhoods flagship the Miranda. In monitoring their movements I have deduced that they are both preparing for battle. We could be in for a smashing fireworks display. [Shorty] Pascal, what are you doing? There is only a one point two percent chance that you will be able to construct a vessel capable of achieving orbit. Pascal. Do you hear me? Stupid. [Pascal grunts] [romantic music] You don’t understand. I’m the only man in the universe who isn’t ruled by his balls. On the other hand. [alarms] [Hardman internal] I am the architect of the tower of babel. I deposit the seed of destruction that is within the conception of success. That’s why we are here. [explosion] [Shorty] Pascal telemetry from both ships has been abruptly terminated. My sensors detect a large mass of debris in orbit around the planet. A sweep of the area reveals no vessels and no other life forms. We are alone. [Pascal] Hey. Wait a minute. [exciting music] Hey. What gives now? For a week it’s all about sex. This way, that way every way. Then it’s over, like that. What did I do? She draws lines, the crazy drawing of lines with me on one side or the other. In or out. I hate it. [Shorty] She’s from a world of silence. Yeah? Well it’s my fucking planet. [Shorty] Where all action has its purpose. For generations they’ve enforced this behavior. I doubt she would make for sex unless she was damn sure this was the time to expect optimal results. Oh no, not daddy again. [mysterious music] [Pascal sings] Oh for Christ’s sake. She’s my own daughter. Pascal. Pascal. [exciting music] [Shorty] There is only a 6,3 percent probability that this construction can ever become a space worthy machine. I do remind Pascal of this from time to time. Even so, despite his apparent happiness here he persists upon the creation of an improbable escape. His fantasy must also have its effect on me, because it occurs to me that there will be little purpose in my committing this record if he does not ultimately succeed. [static noise]
