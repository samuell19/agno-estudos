- There she is. - Oh, hello hello. Why didn't you let me call you a car? Oh, I... I'm so... nevermind. Wow. This is... ahh. - I told you. - It's really something. Yeah. I told you. I'm really glad you're here. Come on. I'll introduce you. Awesome. Everyone! Our costume designer and makeup artist has arrived. Ah, that's great. Go and introduce yourself. Ah wait, sorry. You didn't give me a lot of details. Who's who? Relax. You'll be fine. Can I get you a drink? It's 10 in the morning. Right. Hi. Welcome. Hi, yeah. Are you, are you the director? Um, uh yeah! Oh, right! Yeah, I know I know, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I feel like I'm just like joining you mid-step. Yeah, well, hopefully you get in sync. Yeah. What brought you to us? Oh, my uh, my godmother's the producer. Are you serious? Yeah, yeah. What about you? Oh, just dumb luck, really. Yeah. Oh, yeah. Cool. Well I guess that just... Kinda sums it up, right? Jewelry? - Yeah. - Who? Room for one more? Oh, of course. Pull up a seat. Thanks. Are you part of the show? Costumes. And makeup. That sounds so cool. I wish I could do that. I mean, anything'd be better than folding people's dirty underwear all day. Who works here besides you guys? Just us. How's the food? Ah. The best I've ever had. You know who he is? Holy shit! Is... is that? Mm-hmm. Youngest master chef in European history. And he made me a Denver omelette. I guess he's friends with the people who own this place? And so they flew him in from Berlin, just for the show. Holy fuck, where am I? Who the hell even knows? If I could have everyone's attention, please! Hi. First of all, I just want to thank each and every one of you for coming out today. I can't tell you what it means to me. I... I couldn't make this a reality without you. This has been a career-long dream of mine. A culmination of four years of hard work. You are now all officially part of a new, theatrical experience, Murder Mystery 2.0. For the next month, you are going to be living and breathing this play and these characters. And if we do our jobs properly, our audience should be teleported into a whole new world. A kind of a virtual-reality, if you will. But with the best kind of avatars: Actual actors who play their parts 24 hours a day. To the next month! Next month! Yes. And to my actors! And to my angel. Who without your unending and creative support, none of this would be possible. And to all of you. My magnum opus, "The Light From the Tower!" Cheers! Cheers! Cheers. Hey, your uh, godmother showed me your sketches. - Gorgeous. - Oh! Super excited to see them come to life. Thank you! Thanks, yeah. So what was your um, your, like inspiration- -Yeah I feel like you really understand what I want here. Yeah, no I mean... Yeah, this is definitely... It seems like a... Like a really cool project. Yup. Um... There is something I'm like not totally clear on, though. Um... So when you said that you want the actors to... live their parts, like 24/7, did you mean that literally? Or... - Of course not! - Yeah. No. I just... I want them to... be able to immerse themselves in the experience. I want... no connection between them and the real world, you know? With that I believe it creates an... unobstructed... view... to their... process. Hmmm. Yeah, well, it makes me glad I'm just the costumer. Same. Hey... What are you thinking about? Nothing... Just that it's really beautiful here. Mmm. I really wish Dad could have seen this. I wish I could have met him. But hey, look. You know what? It's damp out here... Let's go inside. We don't want our leading lady catching a cold now, do we? - No. - Come on, let's go. Alright. - I love you so much. - Mmmm. Oh! Oh! Oh, I'm... I'm, I'm sorry. It's okay. I'm sorry, I..I didn't realize you guys were rehearsing. Relax. We're not rehearsing. Ohhh... okay. We're engaged. Oh, wow! I didn't realize you guys were engaged in real life. They thought it would be more realistic. I can see why. See you tomorrow. Oh! It's nice to meet you. Mm-hm! Mm-hm! Yeah, right. Bitch interrupting... Hey. Hey! You look like you're a thousand miles away. What are you thinking about? Nothing. Okay. You can't start lying to me until after we're married. We're actors. Lying is what we do. Wow... We haven't been here 24 hours and you're already making it bleak. Oh come on. Aren't you at least a little freaked out about the next month? No. It's just a job. It's nothing we haven't done before. Yes, it is. There's always been a barrier between us and the audience. There's always been a barrier between us and the character. Now, they can touch us... And they can see what we see. We can't hide anything. We can't get away from the work. At all. Okay, okay. We have each other. We can just be each other's safety nets. Yeah, and even there, we're engaged, and our characters are engaged. It's still a continuation of the work! We're.... Ah, is there any place for any of us to escape? Okay. I think... that you're overthinking this a little bit. Okay? Alright? It's gonna be okay. Actually, that reminds me... Hey, what's that all about? You said you'd leave it on forever. Well, I don't want to lose it during rehearsal. Hurry up, we're about to start the read-thru. Yeah, can you come here a second? Something wrong? I don't know about these costumes. What's wrong with them? What's the hold up? We're about to start the read-thru. Apparently, we have a problem. It's the costumes. They're not what I selected. Okay, well, this is what we brought. I signed off on them myself with the head of the costume department at NYU, so um... Maybe they just look different to you. Uh, well, that's impossible, because I took detailed photos and sketches of everything. I wrote down all the ID numbers, I can show you- -We don't have time for this. Um, maybe you can just change your vision, okay right? Visions change all the time, let's just deal with it, alright? Let's go! Nice going. What's his deal? Don't worry, he's just used to getting his own way. But he's a talented guy who happens to be a very, very old friend of mine. So if I were you, I'd do my best to make friends, little girl. Of course! Fucking bitch. I don't understand. I love you. And I think you know that. I can't. Tim bursts into the room and spots the two. He pulls out a gun. Rosie throws herself in front of Gabe. No! Get out of the way, Rosie! No, Tim. Please don't do this. You bastard! Tim advances on the pair, tears Rosie away from Gabe, and the two men struggle violently for the gun. A shot rings out. Rosie screams. Tim stands up, looking down at his friend's body, surprised that he actually did it. He turns to Rosie. How could you? How could I? This is your mess! Tim walks past Rosie as she looks at him wide-eyed. Clean it up? Clean it up! Rosie bursts into tears. She then stands up and addresses Tim. No! You bastard! I hate you! He was the one good thing in my life. Ah. That's what you used to call m.... to say... a-about me. But with him it was true. You never needed me, never wanted me. I've... heard enough. Hmm... Uh, line? Line! Line, line! Really? You've got the script right there. I don't, I don't have it highlighted. I... I've heard enough. I've... I've heard quite enough. From you. Line, line! I, I expect you to be ready to leave in an hour. The train arrives in one hours. Have your bags packed. I'm not leaving! Tim turns back to his fiancé.. Um....sorry.... Just gonna... Grab these... Don't mind me... Oh yeah, uh, thank you, housekeeper. Mm-hmm. Okay. Tim turns back to his fiancé. Yes, you are. No, I can't. Rosie kneels down beside Gabe's body. Tim just looks down at them. Fine. Stay here. Alone. You've made a fine tomb, dear. Tim leaves. Rosie addresses the corpse of her lover. It will be our temple. End of play. Great job, team! Great job! Alright! Let's take uh... ten minutes? And, we will be back. Alright, that's ten, everyone! So, what do you think? What's wrong? Get off me! Just... I wasn't really getting much from you. Well, it was just a read-thru. You need to take this seriously. I'm trying! But it's not very good. It's not exactly Shakespeare. And it's not even original. This is gonna be great, huh? I don't trust him. So what'd you think? It sounds good. Thanks. I'm really proud of it. I've been working on this script for so long... I practically have it memorized. But hearing it out loud for the first time today... ...really made it sound new. You haven't done a read-thru before? No. Wait, why? I just, I just mean that, it, that it, it... seems like the actors are already... really comfortable with... the material. That's good casting, baby! I know these guys from NYU. Everyone there has seemed to think they're going places. Especially that guy! Yeah! This guy's going places! Haha! Uh, when did you guys graduate? Hmm. Mm. Yo! What kind of job is this? What are you talking about? Why would you put a 22-year-old kid in charge of something like this, okay? He doesn't, he doesn't even have any experience outside of the classroom. It wasn't really up to me. What are you talking about? You're the producer! It's like, it's like the one thing that you do! Aren't you worried about your investment? Not exactly. His parents own this place, and they're paying for all of it. All I had to do was find talent. Including you. I'm just here to babysit and make sure he doesn't burn the house down. Wait, wait, wait a minute! Are you fucking kidding me? This is... this is just.... It's a, it's a pet project for some rich kid?! Oh god! You told me that a lot of important people were involved with this. I just.. Why didn't you just tell me the truth? First of all, I'm not fucking kidding you. And second of all, there are a lot of important people involved in this. Maybe just not the ones you wanted. And third of all, this could very easily advance your career, just like everyone else's, so I suggest you take a breath, calm down, and find a way to make it work. Ohhh, I don't fucking believe this! Believe it! The script may not be very good, and the director may have more money than talent, but you have a real opportunity to showcase yourself. That's why I insisted you be here. Oh, and by the way... Watch your fucking language. Are you serious right now? Remember, I'm just here to babysit, darling. Aaaaarghhhhh!! Shit! That's the thing, that's the thing. It's about a bear. It's about a bear trying to find his mom in the forest! I know! How many times has that been done? But the problem was, it turned out the whole time, it was a midget in a bear costume! Are you kidding me? They fucking used a midget? Uh-huh! No way! We could get a real midget. Did I mention how nice it is to be working with you again? You know I... I missed you. I'm sure you have. You want to... take this party upstairs? Yes... But not with you. Thanks for the lovely mess. Watch your tone. No drinking on the job, please. By the way, rehearsals officially start today. So, no one's leaving the grounds except you. Okay? And please make sure that the garage stays closed at all times. What if there's an emergency? At all times. Okay. Okay...? Okay, sir. Hey, what's up, Chef? How 'bout some waffles? Oui, monsieur. My man. Oh, um... By the way, this morning the internet wasn't working. I think the wi-fi is broken. No, it's not. Turned it off. Why? There was no internet in the 1920s. Wow. Is that for me? Yes. It's beautiful. Thank you. Uh, actually, I'm glad you're here. I'd like you to try it on. So I can make some alterations. Hey! Hey, we've been looking for you. We're about to start rehearsal. What do you think? Oh, it's nice... Looks a little tight, though. Where? Just overall. Have you gained some weight, babe? Dude, seriously?! I'm just saying. It looks a little tight. It's okay! I'll be there in a minute. Just get me out of this! Jesus... He didn't mean it. You sure about that? He's under a lot of pressure. And we aren't? For the record, I think you look perfect. Do you understand, right? You're both vying for the same woman! Alright, the stakes could not be higher! Alright? So I need to see it. I need to feel it. Okay? Um, hey, um... I need to talk to you, man. We're in the middle of something. Okay, this is important. Fine... Take a break guys. What is so important? I just don't think we should be using this room. It's too small. How long have they been at it? I don't know, what is it with those two? Ah, you know, little boys. They always have to prove who's bigger. Well, this better not continue for the rest of rehearsal. Is that a threat? No. Just an observation. I am not having this conversation again. Okay, it's just too small. Exactly. It's small. It adds to the claustrophobia, the feeling of the scene! It is perfect for this scene! By the way, I couldn't get into my email last night. I think the wi-fi is down. It's not so much down as off. Say what now? Our fearless leader doesn't want any distractions. Um....no. Okay so where's the audience gonna stand, huh? It's not practical! Art is not practical. Hey come on, the party's about to start. I don't feel like it. Yeah, well I don't think we have a choice. Come on, everyone's waiting. No. Okay... Is everything a joke to you? Yeah. Pretty much. In this business, if you don't laugh, you cry, and if you cry too much, you go crazy. And I've seen you go crazy way too many times. Fuck you. Dude, you take this way too seriously sometimes. And by sometimes, I mean all the time. Yeah, because I have to. This is all I know how to do. I'm not good at anything else. And what am I good at? Pretending to be other people. I'm good at lying and holding myself up for inspection. That's fucked up! And what happens if I fail? What happens then? Dude, come on... And I'm just... Everybody sees me as just another guy... Just another guy who doesn't know who he is. Have you tried talking to- -She wouldn't understand. I was gonna say therapist. Seriously? Well, yeah. I knew you wouldn't get it. Where are you going? The party! You're right! I really don't have a choice. Alright, everybody! I just want to make a quick toast... to my wonderful actors... my wonderful crew.. and... everyone else here... for a absolutely, wonderful job, well-done on our Day 1... Do you know how to do this? Ah, I got it, I got it. You got it, boss. Yeah... There we go! Now the party's started! I just want to say... thank you, everyone. And to a very, very successful... first day! - Woo! - Yay! There we go, baby! Let's do this! Yeah! Here we go. Come on! Let's do this. You want a full pour, none of this "toast." Uh-uh-uh-uh! No no no no no. No drinking on the job! Yo! You know Chef can get us some hookers, right? Like some bushy mountain people, or... you know, the shaved college types? Bush? Are you paying? Mm-hm. Good. Yeah, okay. Oh, oh, cheffy, cheffy! What are you making? None of your motherfucking concern! Alright. Uh... duck a l'orange. Mmm! Cool! That uh, that confit last night was... awesome. "Cool?" I wouldn't say cool, I would say "sophisticated." Hey um... Why don't we go upstairs and celebrate? Celebrate what? Today was a disaster. We didn't accomplish anything. Nobody knows what they're doing, and it's making us look bad. But it's just the first day. Besides, you're doing good work. You really don't get it, do you? Wh...? I guess I don't. I guess you don't. Well... What's wrong, now? You saw how things went today. Okay, I do not think I have ever heard a director say that they need to stage a confrontation scene in a garden because they "found the rocks compelling." That is insane! Will you relax?! It's important to me that you know that that's insane. Relax! We have good actors, that's 60% of the battle. That is like saying that war is 60% bullets, so fuck it, let's just go take that fucking hill okay? What about bombs? And, and flamethrowers? And I don't know, a little bit of strategy? Okay? Flamethrowers, how delightfully archaic. Please join us in the 21st Century. I think you'll like it. We have drones, now! Please don't do that, don't do that, okay? I am not in a position where I can afford to fail. Will you relax? This is a passion project of a well-connected, 22-year-old nobody. We have nothing to lose and everything to gain! Just get what you can out of the experience and... I don't know, enjoy the party? Jesus fucking Christ! What the fuck is wrong with you?! Hello? In here. Oh, hello. What exactly is the plan? I was hoping we could revisit our previous conversation. I thought that was over. Hardly... When I like something, I keep it. I am so glad I bumped into you. Not as glad as I am. Hey. Do you want to run lines? Ahh... No. Okay. I hate these pants, they're so itchy. How did people in the 20s wear such heavy layers? I was abducted by aliens last night. Huh? Just making sure you're paying attention. You are so needy! What's wrong, Princess? Shh! You jerk! When are you gonna stop calling me that? When you stop acting like such a brat! Ah! You! Ow! You're the worst! Okay, okay! Okay. Okay. But seriously, what's wrong? Well... Does he seem a little different to you? Well, you know how he is when he gets into actor mode. Well, yeah, but I mean, does it seem a little different? You've known him longer than I have. Are you seriously worried? No... It's just... You know, it's weird how you can love a person without knowing much about them. It's so quiet here. Yeah, it's beautiful, isn't it? Sure. What's wrong? I do not understand the script, okay?! It makes no goddamn sense, and it's pissing me off! How so? Never mind. I'll figure it out. Please don't stop talking to me. Good morning. Good morning! Usual? Yes. Please. Holy shit! What? I have a "usual" from a Michelin-starred chef... And it feels normal. Okay? Like this is just my life now. You know? And it's only been a week. I know, it's strange how it gets to you. What do you mean? I have prepared food, uh... for a lot of very rich people for a very long time, and uh... If there's one thing I've learned, It's that, as soon as you get a little too much of anything... You cannot go back to a lot of little things. Suddenly, everything just isn't enough. You know, I'm not hungry anymore. C'est la vie. Don't you think that this is a little unnecessary? It's in the script. It was added to the script. I don't think that this is safe, okay? Oh my god, I am not having this conversation right now. Guys, huddle up. I hope he breaks his fucking neck up, okay? Okay, so. I want you to grab her by the neck. You're gonna push her up against the railing, like you're gonna throw her off the edge. Okay? Dude, I don't know. What don't you know? I don't think it's a good idea. Yeah, I, I, I really don't see the point of this scene. Okay, sweetheart. He just found out you had an affair, and now you're gonna tell me he's not gonna try to kill you? Okay. Let's do this. I want you here. I want you... there. Okay. - Lift her up. - Wait, what?! - Grab her by the throat. - Okay. There we go. Hold up! What's gonna keep her from falling? He's not gonna let her fall. Just grab her by the throat and let's see what happens. Wait, no. I, I, I, I don't like this. Please just let me go. No no no, this is perfect. This is the exact tone that I want. Please, no, let me go. Let me go, let me go, please! Nope, let it... Keep it going. - Please just let me go. - Keep it going. Stop! Let me go. Wait! Hey! Uhhh! The hell you doing? - Are you okay? - Yeah, I'm fine. Excuse me! What the fuck?! I'm not comfortable with this! You are being so unprofessional right now! I am being unprofessional because I'm worried about my friend plummeting off a building?! Wait! Wait wait wait wait wait! I just need a break, okay? - Wait! - Please I just need a break! I was- -I know, I know, I know, I know! It's okay, okay? Everything is gonna be okay. As long as we keep cool. Okay? Why are you being so nice to me? Um...'cause guys are jerks. I just want to create something. Well? Well, what? Aren't you going to go after her? No. Unbelievable! Hey hey hey! We're not done here. Jesus Christ... I enjoyed that. Hey. You okay? No! What am I even doing here? #actorlife? You suck. I know. I do. I really do. But it's not that bad. Better than our student showcase. Oh geezus, don't remind me! What're you reading? - The Crucible? - Yeah! Yikes! Is that judgment I hear? No, I just don't get what it is with you and Arthur Miller. I mean, of all the playwrights to be obsessed over, why him? I was in this play when I was eleven. That's a little dark for an eleven-year-old. I was always a kind of weird little kid. But this is why I became an actor. The first time I got up on stage and said my lines, something just felt right. I just, I knew I wanted to do this for the rest of my life. And finally being able to express all the emotions that I wasn't allowed to, and.. being able to go to that dark place. Mmm. Don't you people believe in therapy? No! Acting's better than therapy! Oh? I mean, with acting, I can just shut off my brain and be somebody else and tell a whole new story. It's really kind of like a meditation. That's probably why I love that maniac I'm engaged to. There's something dark about him, too. We were made from the same twisted stuff, and it just feeds off each other. There's your Oscar speech! You know, I've known you for a long time, and I have never heard you talk like that. I just can't seem to figure you out. Mmm. Guess I can't call you Princess anymore. It's really quiet here... I don't know how anyone could live in a place like this and stay sane. It's gonna be okay, weirdo. Is that my new nickname? Yeah. Great! - Awesome. - Haha, awesome! Stupid! Well if you just wanna keep reading that! - Okay, well, then fine, well then- - I'll get out of your hair- -Okay, great! Maybe I want you to go. Just a reminder that it is dark. So I don't want you to hurt your little eyeballs. Morning. Good morning. How'd you sleep? Good. You? Fine. What's wrong? Nothing. I just think I'm going a little stir-crazy. Oh, I can relate to that. Especially with such a dysfunctional group of people. I'm sorry, I know that you're friends. Oh, no, don't worry about it. I get it... I love them, but I am well-aware of their shortcomings. Well-aware. I don't know when it happened, but at some point, I became the unofficial backstage therapist. That makes sense. Out of everyone here, you seem the most inclined to actually listen. Thank you. But real talk, though. What is your friend's problem? Nothing. He's just a perfectionist. I think that's why I got this job. I'm the only scene partner he hasn't gone totally ape-shit on. Wouldn't be surprised if he took playing this part 24/7 thing as a personal challenge. Doesn't that worry you? No, it's just the kind of guy he is. You know, they both mean a lot to me, and they're both under a lot of pressure, so I'm happy to listen when things are bad and just pick up the pieces. Still, you'd think two people who were engaged would want to talk to each other about their problems, rather than a mutual friend. It's cute that you think that. - Yeah, it sounded naïve as I was saying it. - Yeah. No, but I, I see what you're saying, and I think that sometimes relationships look different to the people inside of them. That's oddly poetic. Thank you. I heard that on "The Office." You are my favorite. Alright! How we lookin'? We're almost done. We're running behind. You asked me to finish this, didn't you? What? It is nice. I know, right? Yeah? Ooh, I like the tie. It kind of matches your dress. It matches my dress, yeah. - I mean... - It's cute. - Why... - It does feel good! I know, right? They're getting along. Mm-hm. If I was her fiancé, I'd be worried. Okay! We're good. Great! Places, everybody! Alright. Action! Gabe, you are such a fool. You laugh, but you can't deny that I'm right. I do deny it. I wholeheartedly deny it. Then why do you stay? What? Do you love him? What kind of a question is that? An honest one, from one friend to another. Gabe, please! Hold! Okay... Why are you standing there? Um... I mean, why is Rosie the character standing here? A man who is not your man just confessed his love to you. You're not gonna slap him in the face and run out of the room? Well, it's just because... I guess... Okay, there's no guessing. No guessing! Because I love... love him, too. Exactly! So why am I not seeing that? I just, I don't think it's right for my character to show too much affection right now. I still love Tim. Okay, but you have to be open to the possibilities, okay? And right now, you're playing attitudes, instead of playing actions. What do you mean? I mean you're a little flat. A little dull. So, do whatever you gotta do, and let's get going here. Come on. Ready? Yes. Where from? Right. From your last line. Mm-hmm. And... Action! An honest one, from one friend to another. Gabe, please. Answer me! Why are you doing this? 'Cause if you were mine, I wouldn't treat you like that. Gabe... Gabe, we tried this a long time ago, but it just, it didn't work. You have to know I'll always care about you. It's not even half of what I want. Stop. Hold! Yes! That is exactly what I want. Okay! I want to run it again. Places, everybody. What'd you think? Very good. Good? That was fantastic! Did you see the way he looked at her? It's like a fat kid looking at a taco. Man... So uh... You excited for today? Mmm. Is that a yes or a no? I don't know. Wait, what are you talking about? Well, we are halfway through. Which means, time to blow off some steam. Oh, you're right! When do they get here? As soon as you call "hold" on the last scene. I knew there was a reason I hired you. Man, I have been cooped up for so long. I really need this. You're sick. I love it. Ahh. Yeah. Alright! Congratulations, gang! We are officially halfway through the rehearsal process, and in honor of all your hard work, we have decided to throw you a little party. Alright? We're bringing in some friends from New York, courtesy of the chef. Now you've all worked hard, so trust me. You've earned this. Besides, it'll be a really good time to get into character. Because this... Will be a real, Roaring 20s Bacchanal! Unbelievable! Shush! Oh my god, this is such a bad idea! Get off your high horse. You know, it wouldn't hurt you to get a little drunk and fuck a stranger. Have you always been like this? Oh my god! Oh my god, that's it! What? Ahh! That's it! You are here for the party! This is... This is just, this is summer vacation to you! You said that you were here to babysit. But I'm here to babysit you! Look me in the eye and tell me I'm wrong. Tread lightly, darling. What'd I tell you? Little asshole... You're a little asshole with a tie... Hey. Hey. What you uh, doing out here by yourself? I know what kind of party this is. And I've already got more than I can handle. Come with me. I'm good. Excuse me? I said, I'm good! Why don't you go find somebody your own age? Oh, nice! Oh my god! Don't want to lose it! Mmmm.. Hi. Hi. You look like the kind of girl who doesn't say no. Not if I'm getting paid. Oh... Well, then. Hey, you had your chance. Mind if I join? You up for it? 'Kay. There's an upcharge. Okay by me. Who stole my hat? Who has my hat? You took my hat! Tiffany! Bad girl, we don't steal. Mmmm.... I'm so... No! Wait, no! Don't get my hat! Oh you don't have my hat. She has my hat. Oh my god, it does look good on you. I know. I think it looks really good. And your hair looks good. Mmmm... I like your hair. You like my hair? I like his hair. I have nice hair. You do have nice hair! I have, I have the flow. I have the flow. You do. You're very wavy... It's flowing. I ride the wave, baby! Keep flowing. I ride the wave... Wearing a tie... Which is cool... Ooooh… Uh-oh... Is this a weapon? No... oh... Mmm. Hmm.... He's such a goob, right? Mmm. He's cute, I like him. Yeah. I'm glad you all came. Me too. Hey! I want to talk to you! See I want to talk to you! Where were you last night?! Around. Seriously? They throw a party with a bunch of sluts for us, and all you can say is "around?!" Calm down! And you disappear all night? No! I want to talk about it. Where were you and who were you with? Come on! Places! Alright! And... Action! I don't understand, Rosie. I've tried to explain, Tim. But it doesn't make any sense. I love you! Don't you know that? I don't know! What do you mean? Don't I show it?! No! Not anymore. I just... I don't know you, anymore. Nice! Nice! Your stage directions suck. Nice night. Mm-hmm... Doesn't that concern you? Nah. Why? Oh, it's just like a scientist doing research. It doesn't mean anything. The hell it doesn't! What's it to you? Nothing. Bullshit! I beg your pardon? And I know about you two. You know what, there's something else... Hungry actors have no sense of discretion. Yeah. Not that that's ever stopped you. You have quite the reputation around campus. Oh, don't you seem to know a lot? And I know something else... What's that? You like revenge. Mm-hmm. Yeah, I know a couple actresses who, uh... lost big roles because they came between you and your conquests. So what? I don't have time for airheads with bigger tits than brains. Is that so wrong? Uh, no. Not at all. You're a strong woman who demands loyalty. And what about you? What about me? Oh, please. You don't think I know about your reputation on campus? You're a perfectionist, to the point of obsession. Remind me, how many of your scene partners quit because you took things too far? Not that I blame you. You're a professional. You demand excellence. From everyone. Just out of curiosity... What did she tell you about herself? Hey, you. Hey, yourself. That was uh, fun last night. Yeah, it must have been. I have some bruises in some very strange places. Heh. Yeah, I had forgotten how good you are at that. Well, alcohol and a third party helps. Mmm... So... Care to revisit? No. What? Why? It was what it was, and now it's over. Seriously. Look, just because I like to have a little bit of fun with you occasionally, doesn't mean I want to spend all my time with you. Besides.. What could possibly top last night? Ah, ha. Hey. You okay? I don't really know anymore, haha. Okay... That hardly seems necessary. I disagree. Ha. What's eating you? Hahaha. Pun. Not intended. Okay, seriously, what's... what's wrong? Have you been hearing odd sounds at night? Okay, Chef. I'm gonna need you to stay with me, okay? What do you mean, uh? I don't know if you've noticed, but everyone in this house is collectively losing their fucking minds. So, I'm gonna need you to pull it together. I mean, shit is going to hit the fan, and when it does, I'm gonna need you to help me clean up the mess. Clearly the actors aren't the only ones with a flair for the dramatic. You know I'm right. Oh and the noises you've been hearing at night... Those are just the sounds that people make when they're cornered. And that's a lot scarier than any ghost. Can't argue with that. None of this works, does it? Hmm? What we're doing here. None of it makes any sense. A cheap version of "The Great Gatsby" in a stone house that's more STEVEN KING!! Than it is F. SCOTT FITZGERALD!! People are gonna laugh at us. Ahhh... I'm never gonna work again. And why the fuck is there a TV in here?! Why can't you just fucking tell me what's wrong?! Oh my god... You keep yelling. Keep it down. What do you mean, that's yelling? What is wrong with you? Why not- -How can I concentrate on the work if you're yelling in my ear?! Because you won't talk to me! You are yelling! I won't talk to you! I just want you to talk to me! Why should I talk to you, when you won't even dedicate yourself to the work?! You fucking wimped out in the bell tower, and I had to sit there and watch you cower in fear! How can I fucking listen to someone who's gotten so much goddamn- -You're really psychotic! I fucking hate you! No, dude, I'm telling you. The bed has to stay right here, okay? The lighting is perfect. - But it looks stupid here! - Here we go again... I bet you those two won't even notice if it- -Okay, no, I am done talking about this, okay?! The bed stays! Places, everybody! Outside! Now. I want to talk to you. Excuse me? Look. I put up with this bullshit for so long, because I owed your daddy a favor. But enough is enough! Okay, fine! Take a break, everybody, Jesus Christ! So, now what? You heard him. Take a break, everyone. I'm sorry you didn't get to rehearse your scene. I was really looking forward to it. Yeah.... Do you want me to wait up for you? Okay. Yo, seriously, man. What the fuck?! Why did you call me out like that in front of everybody? Because you don't know what you're doing, and everyone in there fucking knows it! Shut up! Really? Oh! Oh, is that all you got, little boy? Oh! Oh, fuck! Fuck! Dude! Did you really just- -Dude, dude! I'm sorry! - Oh, fuck you- - Oh shit! You know, you really are doing a good job. Of course, you're used to playing different parts. You've been doing this for a long time. You know how to carry yourself when you need to. You know when to say the right things, and you're certainly good at improv. But... I think you're scared. So, what did you say your father did again? See, your charming fiancé told me that he was a banker, and that he and your mom died in a car accident. See, I find that interesting, because according to my research, he was actually a single father, and a mechanic, in who-gives-a-shit, Iowa. And of course, his death was just as dramatic as a fiery car crash... Cardiac arrest from a massive overdose. Did I get my facts straight? Hey! Stop it! - No! - Back off! - That little shit has no fucking- - Go back! That's it! I'm calling the police! Don't you fucking dare! No! Now, I can understand why you'd want to lie. New city, new life. But what do you think your rich friends would think, if they found out the truth about you? And as for that young man you were just lying in bed with, I don't think he'd take the news so well. Beauty rarely has any heart. It's nothing personal. I think you're a nice girl, but... I want you to know that I see you. And honestly, I think this whole thing is gonna blow up in your face. You don't belong in this world, and you never will. Good job on that scene last night. That was... fucking great. Thanks. Yeah. Thanks. You okay? Not really. What's wrong? I just feel like I've been living with this character for so long, I'm forgetting myself. You know? Yeah, I know what you mean. Really? Yeah... We've been cut off from everything, for I don't... I don't even know how long anymore. I have not seen or talked to my family in weeks. I have no idea what is going in the outside world. And I just... I just feel like... This is my life now. I dress you people. That's it. That is my whole existence. Can I ask you something? Of course. What if you liked someone, but you'd lied to them? Okay? Well, do you tell them? And how much do I like them? You weren't really sure? I mean, you were kind of mixed up about it. Is this person the chef? 'Cause I'm definitely in love with him. I'm, I'm serious. - Oh. Right, sorry. - It's okay. Um... Well, how big is the lie? Really big. Like, life-changing. Oooh. Yeah. Um... You know, if I really cared about the person then I would tell them, and then if they didn't take it well, then I guess I'd just know I was better off. Yeah. Thank you. Yeah. Of course. Um... I know I wasn't very nice to you when you first got here, but I'm really glad that you're here now. Thanks. Yeah. Yeah, me too. What was that all about? I don't know. She has the look. What look? Cabin fever. We all have that look. She hasn't been eating, neither. Ughhh, I know, I thought that her costumes were looking a little bit looser. I don't blame her, that boyfriend of hers seems like an ass. I know! I hate how he talks to her! Well, either she's going crazy like the rest of us... Or she's lovesick. Like there's a difference. Clean that spoon! Hey! What's up? Hey! Um... There's something I kind of want to talk to you about. Okay? Like, this is, this is difficult for me, but I wanted you to hear it from me, and not somebody else- -You don't really like pistachio ice cream! You were just humoring me! Um... I'm being kind of serious right now. Okay? Yeah. Yeah, I can see that. Um... I lied to you. I'm not from New York. My family wasn't rich. The only family I have is my dad, and he, um... Well, the only reason I got into NYU was because of a scholarship. Please say something. Why did you lie? I wanted to be somebody else. Anybody else. And I wanted you all to like me. You hate me now, don't you? No. I'm worried about why you thought you needed to lie. Did you really think none of us would like you if we knew the truth? I don't really know. Look, I don't care about that shit. Seriously. I don't. How long have you been living like this? I don't know. I've been living with the same lies for a really long time. And they just feel real now. That... That is seriously messed up. Please don't judge me. I'm not judging you. I'm worried about you. You deserve better than this. Who else have you told? Nobody. Just you. Seriously? Mm-hmm. Why did you tell me now? Because, um... I care about you. Yeah? Yeah. Good morning! Oh, geez! What the hell? Oh, I'm sorry. Where were you last night? Doing some research. I missed you. Did you? Yes! I've missed you this whole time! Oh, what do you mean? You know what I mean. I mean, ever since we got here, I just feel like you... I'm sorry, um... I don't think I can do this anymore. Hmm. Well, it's good that you're finding that out now. How would you ever survive on a real project? Are you serious? Not everything is about our craft! I am talking about us! I am your fiancée. I know. I know, alright? That's what makes this so hard! What are you talking about? What...? Ooooooh. My god... Mmmm. I'm sorry, babe. Oh I'm sorry! Is it that maybe there's something lacking in your performance? It certainly seemed that way to me. More kegels… Can anybody hear me? I'm so tired of how quiet it is here. And I'm tired of pretending to be something that I'm not. Do you hear me? Hey, what's wrong? Do you hear it, too? Hear what? Hear what? The house... It's talking to me! We can do this. We can do this. It's okay. Just let us go back downstairs okay? Thank you. You can do it. Hey. You can do it, okay? Okay. I'm so glad you're here. I know, me too. We're gonna get you cleaned up and we gotta put on that dress, it looks so fucking incredible, okay? I need you to stand up... Stand up. Let's go... The last, right here... Places. How was she? Action. How could you? What are you talking about? What, you think I wouldn't find out? You don't deserve her. You were supposed to be my friend, you son of a-! Hold! Stop! Hey, hey guys! Guys, guys, break it! Up! Come back when you cool off. Thanks. What the fuck, man? You know what? This whole thing started out kind of funny, but now it's affecting their work. You have let this entire situation get out of hand. Me? Yes, you. There is more to directing than ordering people around and spouting sanctimonious bullshit. Yeah, well you're no saint in this, either. Excuse me, what the fuck is going on? What do you think? I don't fucking know. All I know is that the actors have gone insane, and I want to know why. Think about it. Oh, wait, did she... Did she cheat on him? Duh. How do you know that?! Okay, look. We need to stop this. We need to shut this whole thing down. Yeah, we can't do that. Okay- -We have a product to deliver, on time, - whether we like it- - I know. - Or not. - Yes, I know. I really needed this to work, too. Okay? But honestly, I don't care anymore. Alright? I have no idea how fucking long I've been here. I don't know what time of day it is, I don't know if it's night. Hey! Listen to me! He has been torturing her and pushing her away for weeks, and it's only gotten worse, alright? We need to shut this whole stupid project down now, before somebody gets seriously hurt. Where you going? Oh! We have to work on our next scene! No! I don't think you really have a choice, sweetheart! No no no no! Please! Come here! No! Damnit! Still one bar. Hey! Hey hey! Where are you going? Did you see anyone go back just now? It's all very logical. How am I supposed to react in such a far-fetched situation? Oh my god... what did you do you? Just some necessary research. That was our goal, wasn't it? - No. - Mm?... To live these characters 24/7. Wasn't that our goal? Didn't it make our performances that much better?! Let go of me! I, I don't understand. He is insane! Okay, we need to call the police. Okay, you've been under a lot of stress lately, and I think your mind is playing tricks on you- -Fuck you! Excuse me?! I don't have time for this! Please. Please just tell me you didn't push me away on purpose, just so you would know how it would feel! Why would you do that?! You really shouldn't have lied to me. I didn't, I didn't lie to you! You're lying to me right now! How could you sleep with that idiot? How could you do that to me? At least it will make for a good story for- You're still lying. You're still lying to me. Don't do that. Please, don't do that! Stop lying to me! Stop it! Or I'm gonna fucking drop you! Please... I get it. At least now I know what it feels like. Mmmm! Oh my god! Oh my god! Jesus Fucking Christ!
