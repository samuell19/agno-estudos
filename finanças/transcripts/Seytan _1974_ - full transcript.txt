Goodmorning Ahmet, There are mice up at the attic. They made too much noise last night. Buy a few traps and set them up. The attic is clean, madam. I don't think there are any mice up there. All right then we've got clean rats. Do as I am saying. As you wish, madam. Suzan... Which lesson will you teach to Gul? Today we will study mathematics. How is she doing? If you ask the truth, not so good. Ok... We will talk about this with you later. Hello! How are you, Ayten? Hello Ekrem! Where have you been? You got lost again. I wanted to visit you. I will be waiting. How was today's lesson? Not bad. Where is Gul? I'm here mommy. And now i'm hugging the most beautiful mom of the world. And now i'm kissing the most beautiful daughter of the world. Tell me, what is sixteen multiplied by sixteen? Quit asking math mom. You have to see the sculptures(!) I made. I know. You are painting(!) so good. But also, you have to know math, too. First this... Then this... Then that... Then I made these ones. Great, aren't they? They are all so great. For being the only customer of this famous sculptor, will you be buying my sculptures? Of course I will buy. What an odd world you have... Welcome, my niece. You are welcome, too, uncle. Come and give me a hug. While waiting you, I was reading the essays of your new book. You wrote lots of incredible things again. Who get's these? Your end will look like mine. You will be poor like your uncle. Boy looks like uncle they say. If only I could be like you. It is a great honor for me. Your mother's condition breaks my heart, Tugrul I haven't seen my sister like this before. An old and sick lady, living alone in that very big old house... She got ruined more, when you left that house. You are right. My mother's condition breaks my heart, too uncle. There is nothing to do. My sister sees the truth better than us. What can be done depents on money. You choosed the hard way for yourself, Tugrul. You are not using your education on medical for earning money. If you were not writing the books who are read by no one, but a rich doctor, your mothers' condition would have been better. You are right. I became a bookwriter, whose books are read by anyone. No, no... I don't belame you. On the contrary, I am so proud of you, Tugrul Mom... Mom Tugrul? Welcome my son. My beautiful mommy. My only. How are you? You are alright, aren't you? What happens if i'm alright, Tugrul? You be alright. Don't think about me mom. I'm ok. You are the one who is sick, who needs attention. Your uncle came last night. He talked the same as you do. My uncle is right. Some day, we will move to a pretty house. There will be people around it. That day, you will not be listening radio alone. This is my home Tugrul, do you understand? I'm not going anywhere but here. Your behaviour is strange. Are you troubled by something? Don't hide your sorrow from me. There is nothing wrong, mommy. Gul? Are you the one who plays with this Ouija? Yes, I am playing with it. Do you know how to play? Of course I know. But this game is played by two at least. I always play it alone. Do you want to see how I play? You mean... you don't want to play with me ? No, I want to play but Captain Lersen(!) does not want to play with you. Who is this Captain Lersen? Don't know, just a soul. I ask and he answers. Ok, ask then. Captain Lersen, my mom is a beautiful woman, isn't she? Why aren't you answering ? Captain Lersen, what you are doing is called rudeness. Honey, maybe he is sleeping. No, he never sleeps. Then you need some sleeping. Will you be calling Mr. Ekrem to my birthday? Where did that name just came to your mind? I know that Mr. Ekrem wants to marry with you. Where did this came from ? Birds talked to me. Mom, you will be marrying with him, right? What next! I haven't even think about. He is just a good friend of mine. That's all. Do you love him as much as my dad? As much as your dad? Listen my pretty daughter. I never wanted to talk these with you but... you have to know somethings from now on. I can never love another man but your dad. Now sleep. Close your eyes. Hello... Hello! Yes! I'm calling outside of the city. Are you joking with me reception ? I have been waiting for half an hour on the phone! What do you mean 311 is not answering ? No, I don't understand. Of course it is your duty! Shut up! Don't talk so much! Call that goddamned room again i'm telling you! Don't shout so much, Gul will wake up. These make men crazy! Ok, ok. I'm waiting. The real guilty is the man who is Gul's father. How can he not be coming to his only daughter's birthday? I have ask it to him. Yes? Yes! Which room number? Are you deaf?! 311 numbered room I said! God damn you! Will you write a complaint? Go to the deepest part of the hell! Hello? Hello! Outside the city? No, I do not want to talk. What are you doing here? My bed is shaking, I couldn't sleep. You mush have dreamed it. "Devil" Soul abduction and exorcise ceremony... ...under the light of the modern opinions about mental illnesses. "by Tugrul Bilge" Ahmet, was that you ? Yes, madam. See, there are no rats. All traps are empty. I'm not mad! I'm not mad! Let me go! You know, your mother wanted nobody with her. We even called the doctor so hardly. You had to take my mother to another hospital, uncle. Does it had to be a mental institute? Why haven't you informed me? There was no time to inform you. You have to accept your mother's mental condition, Tugrul. What would it changed if I even informed you? Would you hospitalized your mother to a private one? Do you have money? Who are you looking for? Excuse us. We wanted to see Fatma Bilge. The new patient. Are you a relative? Yes. I am her brother. This is her son. Ok, come in. No, I am not coming. You go on Tugrul, I will wait here. It would be better if you don't. Why? Your mother is having hyterics. Don't see her like that. No, I want to see her. Ok. My lovely, look at him! Stop stop! Go away... Come here, come on! I said go away! Sit down! Mom... Mommy... Look I came. Why did you put me out here, Tugrul? Mom, I will take you out of here. Why did you lock me here ? Why I am saying ? Why ? Mom, please don't talk like that. Shut up for the name of god. I will get you out of here. Suzan, is this your book? No, I saw that book for the first time. Did you put this book to the attic? You know that I don't like books. Have you seen this book before ? No, I haven't. You know i can't read. One second please, pardon me. At which barber have you been made these hairs Madam Gul? It does not concern you. Don't touch my hairs. And also, I got tired of your cold jokes. We never get along well with each other, don't we. At least be nice to me at your birthday. I say that comes from my heart. You are worried about something. You are worried about your father not coming to your birthday, don't you? This also not concerns you. Are you fighting again? I am tired of your fights. Your daughter does not look like you in no way. She is my only. Ekrem, I wanted to ask you something. Last day, while we were playing tennis, there was a man with you. Who was he? You asked the man. Doctor, psychologist, writer and a scholar. What he does is writing these days. But I don't think that anybody reads what he is writing. Does he have a book published? Yes, there is. He wrote a book titled "Devil". Devil? I know that book. So he is the one that writes these nonsense. What is his name? Tugrul... Tugrul Bilge... Gul? Are you sleeping my child? Ooooh... We have company. My girl... My child, what happened to you? Excuse us, Gul is a little sick. My only, what is it? Mommy, please tell me, what is wrong with me? You have nothing wrong my girl. Take your pill now,.. ...there will be nothing to worry tomorrow. Mommy... Why god lets people to get mistaken? We will talk these later. You sleep now. No stain left already. No madam. Wanted to clean... Mommy ! Mommy, stop this please! Mommy, save me! No, I haven't fulfilled my obligations for my mom. Look, I am telling again. You have to get rid of this sense of guilt. She suffered a lot just for me so I can get my education. Did you forget that she even panhandled? I know all of these. But what will it solve to think these all the time? Ok, now go and sleep. I have to go. Let me, let me go! God will curse you all! Let me go! I will kill you ! What you saw was a clear symptom of the disease. The disease is caused by the defected electrochemical activity of the brain. There is a disorder on the upper side of your daughter's brain. The images that she saw is a symptom of the disease. For example, the shaking of the bed. No doctor, no! The shaking bed was not a dream! All of the bed was shaking with my daughter! Madam, there is no shaking bed. First of all, we have to fully examine the brain, and determine the form of the disorder,... and clean the wound on the brain. Amazing. There is nothing on the xrays. Do you want to take another array of xrays? No. It is not a necessity. But I want to see the girl again. Hello. Yes. Yes I'm Dr. Kasim I am coming right now! Gul is getting worse Dr. Is this a periodic spasm? What spasm doctor? Something else is happening to this kid. Mom! Hold me mom! I can not stop! I can not stop, mom! Stop me, mom! My girl, look doctors are here! Everyting will pass. Hold me! Get that hand off me you bastard! Doctor... What is happening to my daughter, will you tell me? What is this? Some psychological factors came all together. Because of these factors, the kid's personality is changing. This psychological change shows itself as pyschophysically(!). Doctor, I don't understand this medical jargon. So, you mean... What is with my girl? I am still thinking that there is a symptom on the upper side of the brain. Doctor, you keep insisting on this upperside of the brain, but saying nothing more! Haven't you seen the kid upstairs? Haven't you heard her voice? She is crying out like there is a second person inside. Don't you even understand this? My god, what is this happening to us ?! Madam, in medical history there were so few double personality cases. The cause of the cases are psychopatalojical(!) symptoms. I want to look at this case from a more logical side. So what do you think you can do? If you give us the permission, we want to check the spinal cord, too. If we can't get the results we want from these test, we can think about other possibilities. And at this time, we must not forget the shock therapy. A shock therapy? The results of tests of the spinal cord are negative. I am sorry, but we were not able to understand the cause of the sickness. The shock therapy is also a vain. Now, what are we doing? I can estimate that, it is time to study the case psychologically. We will show our patient to a psychiatrist. Where did you go, leaving Gul alone? Are you crazy? How can you make a mistake like this when the servant and the cook are on permission? No, I didn't leave Gul alone. Mr. Ekrem was here, I left Gul to him and went to the pharmacy. This is a bigger mistake. Why did you leave Gul to Ekrem? Didn't I warn you for not letting anybody to learn my daughter's condition. Hello... Yes... What? Ekrem is dead? Where? My god... Mr. Ekrem is dead? Yes... Ekrem is dead. Right near to the house. He fell from the stairs and broke his neck. But, how it can be possible. He was right here a few moments ago. Just look at the pendulum, dear girl. Think of nothing. Amazing. This was too easy. She hypnotized immediately. Will you be able to talk to me? Yes. How old are you? Twelve. Is there another person inside you? Sometimes, there is. Then, who is this person? I don't know. Is that Captain Lersen inside you? I don't know! If that is Captain Lersen, will you let me talk to him? No. Why? I'm afraid. Maybe he leaves you, if I talk to him. Do you want him to leave you? Yes. Now I am talking to the other person inside Gul. You are hypnotized like Gul. You have to answer all my questions. Who are you, what is your name? It is strange that a psychologist that cares about the physical world. I don't remember that we met each other before. Yes, we don't know each other. We will meet now. I'm the Superintendent Kadri Erdem of police for homicide. I'm pleased. Do you have an order for me? Not at all. I will ask just a few questions. Yes, ask please. "Devil" Soul abduction and exorcise ceremony... ...under the light of the modern opinions about mental illnesses. Written by Tugrul Bilge. It's a good book. I read it at once. You are making a compliment. What do you think about the death of your friend Ekrem? Don't know. It must be an accident. Have you seen the corpse of Ekrem? No. I haven't Devils break the sorcerers' or victims' necks by turning them backwards. Is this the truth? If you pay attention, what you read is not my idea. I just mentioned a myth in there. Ekrem's body was found at the bottom of a long and steep staircase. His head was looking backwards, and his neck was broken. Can't his neck broke and turn back when he fell? I don't think that something like that can happen. If this is not an accident, it is absolute that the murder has the signatures of murderers... ... who choosed devilish ways. I think as much as the same as you do. Do you believe in devil? No... I don't... Ekrem visited a house near to the murder or scene, before he killed, or died. Do you know the owner of the house, Ms. Ayten? No, I don't. I suppose, we are face to face with an unkown pyschological disorder... which we haven't met ever in our age. We can only explain Gul's condition,... ...by the soul related disorders of the people of ancient ages. On these cases, the patient believes that another soul exist inside his body. Doctor... I don't understand what you mean. Is my daughter going to get cured ? Or does she stay in this condition ever? Tell me this only. I'm afraid that, your daughter has to stay in a mental clinic for a much long time. No ! I will never put my daughter in an asylum or a mad house. My god, what is this happening to us? Even getting an improvement is doubtful,... there is another way for the cure. Then, what is this way for the cure? It is getting out the second personality, by using a powerful inspiration. Just the inspirer must be capable to make the patient believe this. Who left this book opener in Gul's room? Who put this devil headed filthiness in to this house ? One of you did this, it is absolute. Go on, don't hush, talk! This cursed, this filthy thing didn't come to the house by itself, didn't it ! I wanted to see Ms. Ayten. I am, who am I meeting? I'm the Superintendent Kadri Erdem of police for homicide. Is your visit about the death of Ekrem? Yes. Does your daughter remember the night that Ekrem entered her room... ...before the death or murder of him? Ekrem is murdered? Why ? Why ? We are not sure if he is murdered or not. I am only talking about a probability. But how can this be possible? No, don't get excited. You, please just answer my question. Does your daughter remember the night that Ekrem entered here room... ... or not. I don't estimate that my daughter will remember what happened that night. Why is that? Gul is a little sick. Doctors gave her too much sedatives to her that night. I am sorry for your daughter's sickness. What kind of an illness is this? Is it a heavy one? We don't know what the sickness is. We hope it will be cured soon. I hope so. Then you don't think that your daughter will remember the events of the night. I'm afraid yes. The state is serious. It is as much strange as it is serious. What do you mean? I mean this. A huge man like Ekrem enters the room of that sick kid... ...and fells from the window like he pushed himself. Also, after a fall like this simple, his neck breaks and his head turns backwards. When we found his body, his face was looking to his back. A devilish way to kill, this is. I can't understand what you mean. Let me explain further my thoughts. I think that Ekrem was killed and thrown away from the window... ...by a more powerful person. But if there is no one but your daughter in the room,... i can't solve how this murder committed or this accident happened. You are right. This is hard. Are you sure that there we no other person in the house? Yes. I am absolutely sure. A complicated situation. Are you reading this book? No. I haven't read that yet. Do you believe in these stuff? No. I don't believe. I know how hard to have a child. I have a daughter also. God be with you. Good bye. Can you please ask your daughter again if she remembers the night? I don't think she will remember. Good bye. Ms. Ayten? I'm Tugrul Bilge. I am so happy that you came. Has Ekrem ever mentioned me? No. We didn't have much common with Ekrem. Well, did he ever mentioned my daughter and her sickness? I haven't knew you had a daughter. Why did you ask to see me? Can I ask you ? I read your book. I wanted to talk you about banishing devils. I mean exorcism. Excuse me. I don't understand. What do you think about the soul of a person captured by devil, and the cure? You can find enough answers for that in the books written in 16th century. No one believes in these stuff in our age. But you have a written book about this subject. I wrote what I know, not what I believe in that book. Then you don't believe that someone can be possessed by devil. After working on mental illnesses and psychological disorders at the university... believing in these is a little bit hard. My daughter is possessed by devil. I need an exorcist. Do you know someone like that? Do not believe these things. Go to the doctors and psychiatrists before it is too late. I went all. None of them did anything. Exorcism is dangerously depends on inspiration. While there is nothing wrong, idea of being in a possession of devil... ...unite with the person's personality. I have no other way. I want to see your daughter myself for once. But as a doctor and a psychologist. No. I can't let you see my daughter as a doctor, as a psychologist. Nobody is helping me. What is this happening to me? Don't be sad. I will come to your house as a human(!). Get well soon, Gul. I am a friend of your mother. Can you tell me what your sickness is? I want to help you. Unfasten these bonds on my wrists. Then you may hurt yourself. Then shut up, don't talk. If you want, first we can introduce ourselves. My name is Tugrul Bilge. And I'm the Devil. Come on, now untie me. If you are the devil, then you can untie yourself. This would be a very simple display. If I untie myself, then I would prevent you to make me a favor. As I know, devil loves to make evil things. You are like a fox. But you are not a believer. Whom am I not believing? You know who you don't believe. Also you are a not believing in me too. Where is Gul? She is here. In me... Then, show me Gul. No... you can not see her... You also don't know where Gul is. I am the Devil. I know. Then where is she? She is in hell. Your mother is in hell too Tugrul. Do you want to send her a message ? If you know that my mother is dead, then you must already know her second name. Come on tell me... I am sorry but your girl must be hospitalized in a mental institution as soon as possible. No. I said already that I will not allow something like that before. I can't put my girl in an asylum. And which institution are you talking about? That creature up there is not a mental patient. With her face, sound, and behaviour she is a devil. Do you believe that your daughter is really the devil? You saw her too. Then what is your opinion? Devil, or mental patient? Devil or mental disorder. But before I can help you, i need to know the truth. Whatever you do... ...just save my daughter. What about exorcism? For a time, forget that. Did you know that my mother died recently? Yes. I heard that from Ekrem. Was your daughter aware of that? No, she doesn't I'm sure that she never heard this. Why you ask? Not important. It would be better if you were not dealt with this empty labour... Why don't you start the exorcism? Don't you afraid of the exorcism? No... On the contrary, I am happy that we will become one. What do you mean by saying "we"? Gul and you will be becoming one? Of course not my dear fellow, you and I will become one. You did this? Yes. Ok, then do it again. I will do whenever I want. No do it now. Haven't you heard? I will do whenever I want. Irar lavento, Isn't that? (* meant "Ego te abslovo" maybe?) Then you can speak Latin? Nerra torgo sarrugteo. (* what?) Quan to moni I esti? (* meant "Quod nomen mihi est?" ?) Nienti bojo! Quan to moni I esti? Deplemunte otanta! (* meant "La plume de ma tante." maybe?) For how long do you intent to stay in Gul? As long as I can stay on world. Then, you never told me your name. I said I am the devil! Are you deaf!? I'm the Devil! It was too difficult to make her talk. But I recorded so much on tape. You will be the only one who listens to these tapes, won't you? I don't want anybody to know my kid's disease. Maybe I can make a linguist friend of mine listen to it. You have to trust me on this. I wanted to make a confession to you. Go on then, i'm listening. You know that Gul killed Ekrem, don't you? No. I don't know. Gul, had thrown Ekrem from the window. You don't really know if your daughter killed him. I saw Gul, turning her head backwards with my own eyes. Only Devils make this move they say. (babbles) I would say the same thing if I listened this for a thousand times. It is not possible for me to be wrong. These sounds are just Turkish, spoken backwards. This is so strange. Almost unbelievable. Look. Let's listen the same tape reversed from here. You will understand then. "Leave me alone!" "Get out of my sight!" "What kind of a man are you?" "I said I am the Devil!" "I said I am the Devil!" "Signs seen at the sky." "The doors of the hell are opened." Here, you heard it too. Then, what do you think of the latin speaking? All of the latin speaking is true*. Words are intact. (* what a linguist...) But girl has no latin education. After this is your concern. "Leave me alone" "Get out of my sight" "What kind of a man are you?" "I said I am the Devil!" "I said I am the Devil!" "Leave me alone" "Get out of my sight" "What kind of a man are you?" "I said I am the Devil!" "I said I am the Devil!" "Signs seen at the sky" "The doors of the hell are opened" "I said I am the Devil!" Yes? Who? Ok, I am coming right now. What is it, what's going on? I want to show you something. Something strange happened. Let's go upstairs. Look. "Help me" So you came to take some wisdom from me, Tugrul Bilge. Yes, sir. I hope you won't grudge your help from me. Do you believe in that the soul of this kid stolen by the devil? I believe that exorcism is a powerful inspiration. But on the other side, I am helpless in a field where my knowledge does not reach. I have friend who knows this so called exorcism. He was in middle east recently. Is he in Istanbul right now? Yes he is. At this time he is writing a book about this subject. I hope that he excepts to help you. Ms. Ayten. Is Tugrul Bilge here? Yes, he is here. We were waiting for you. Come in. Welcome, sir. I'm Tugrul Bilge. Meeting with you is an honour. I'm happy to meet you, my son. Do you need rest, before starting? We need to start immediately. Do you have any questions of what happened lately? No. There is no need for that. But, you have to be so careful. You will never talk with it. Don't forget that it is the devil. Devil can say all the lie it can, to decieve us. Devil's main target is not the one who he possessed, ... it's us. That cursed creature, adds truth to lies to drag us in pain. You never forget what I said. You must definitely avoid talking to the devil. All right sir. Then... let's go upstairs now. This time you will loose, absolutely. Shut up, you vile devil, trickster, cursed creature. What is that water in the bottle? Zemzem water (* search google) What will you do with that? Wait and you will see. With the name of god... Your not be opposed mightines is eternal, my god. You keep us not being beaten by our rage. Only your high existence can keep the man and all creatures apart from the evil. My God. I find shelter in your holy name. I praise your greatness. Your boundless power will end this torture... made by the creature you created from the fires, to the one you created from mud. Don't grudge your power from this little servant of yours... ...for saving this little girl's possessed soul from the cursed devil. My God. You ordered all of your angels to prostrate... ...for the men you created from dust, mud and clot. Only one who opposed you was,... ...the devil you created from fire. You cursed the devil that day,... ...who not accepted the highness of the men. Today, the oldest and the one under oath enemy of the men devil... ...got this little servant of yours in its black claws. Let the servant and believer men to... ...crouch down your grace which you never grudge from your all creations. Damn the devil, who is the enemy of the man, who is the vile! The creator of all the universes,... ...the only possessor of the life and death,.. ...my dear god. Banish this cruel devil, from the soul of this innocent servant. Show the true path, to this faultless child's mind. Fill with faith and belief, this sinless body. Be grieved you ill-omened devil! Take your black claws from that little soul of yours,... ...with the fear of the wrath of god! Mighty god cursed you eternally you unjust devil! Get away from here! Live back in the darkness of the hell! Evil will never be victorious over the good. I banish you wicked soul. Hell fugitive... Men enemy, vile devil! My god, we take shelter of you! Crush and destroy this executioner. You filthy crone. You tramp crock You can never overcome me! I already settled down in this little kid. She can never escape off me. Hell fugitive... Vile devil! You will never deceive men with your filthy lies. The eternal enemy of the sacred justice, vile devil! Mighty god orders you! Get out of that soul! Tremble with fear before the wrath of god! The source of the all evil, monstrous devil! The mean and treacherous who decieves the nations. Killer and merciless who is the enemy of the life. The one orders you, is god himself! Let this child go! Go away from here! Crumble! Inviter to death! Devil with no life! (* devil with no testicles -- one to one convertion) I just speak to you with the name of god,.. ...leave this innocent child's soul! Be grieved! Be destroyed! God's grace be upon you. God's grace be upon you. God's grace be upon you. (* forgot ? :) ) God's grace be upon you. (* hehe) Tie the devil up, be quick. All other personalities but the original one, are the attack styles of the devil, nothing else. I know. You doubt my words. But I want you to know,.. ...that I came face to face with this devil before. He is a powerfull one. His deceiving power is endless. Why ? Why you put me in the asylum, Tugrul? Shame on you. You put me in an asylum together, with your uncle. No... You are not my mother! I'm your mother, Tugrul. You know this, too. But in her time, you also denied your own mother. You are the devil! Then you started to believe in devil. I'm your mother, Tugrul. Which you left in the ruined old house. Your poor mother. You never become rich, never made me live in a pretty house. My life got rotten in houses with cockroaches. Here is the arrogant crock, who calls me devil. Old dotard. Don't believe in him, Tugrul. Haven't I told you not to talk to the devil? Come on, get out. Don't listen to him, Tugrul. Look, you are deserting me again. No, don't go, stay here Tugrul. Will my daughter die? No. She won't die. Vile Devil! I will never let you kill this girl! No! No! No! My daughter... my kid... Answer my questions by squeezing my hand. Once for yes, twice for no. Did someone throw you from the window? You committed suicide? Are you telling me the truth? Gul? Come on girl, we are being late. I'm comming mommy. Hi. You must have thought for a long journey. Yes. How is your daughter? Fine. She remembers nothing. And I haven't told what have happened. You made the right move. Gul must know nothing. I told you that I had a girl too. Here I came. Come on, aren't we leaving mommy? Let me introduce you my daughter. This man is a friend Gul. Nice to meet you sir. Nice to meet you too little girl. I just wish a great journey to you. You are a very kind person. Goodbye. "The End" (* at last)
