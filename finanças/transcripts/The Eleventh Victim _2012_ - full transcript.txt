"the death of ophelia." Painted around 1852 By sir john everett millais. [engine roaring] You okay? The painting depicts ophelia, A character in shakespeare's play "hamlet," Singing while floating in a brook, Just before she drowned [pleading in terror] no, please... [teacher]: Now, millais painted the background first... [killer whispers]: Shh. [teacher]: And then had a model pose for ophelia. Does anyone know who that model was? Leola? It's okay. It's okay... [sobbing in terror] [leola]: Elizabeth siddal. She who modeled for the pre-raphaelite brotherhood. She was the woman In most all of dante gabriel rossetti's Earliest paintings. Very good, leola. Come on, put that on. Put it on. Come on! Come on, come on. Next week, we're going to move on to georgia o'keefe And her work in new mexico. That's chapter eight in world art. Please, don't just look at it online. [sobbing] You're going to be magnificent. [gasping for air] Shh... [sobbing] no... [strangling and choking] [soothingly] it's almost done. Shh... It's okay. [choking] [whimpering and strangling] [gasps in fright] [sighs] [takes a shaky breath] [♪] [shutter clicks] [door crashes] Put your hands where I can see 'em! Do it now! Let me see your hands! [hidden rifles blast] [groaning in pain] Go, go, go! Man down! Man down! [wailing sirens approach] Freeze! Let me see your hands! [laughing maniacally] Get on the ground! [handcuffs snap shut] [cocking gun] Seven women. Seven innocent young women Whose families waited for them to come home, But they never did, Because they crossed paths with cruise. He fancied himself an artist, And so, just as he had done six times before, Clint burrell cruise put his signature On what would be his final victim, 25-year-old leola sheldon. But lacking the talent to create his own art, He used these women To recreate the works Of infinitely more talented Men and women. Goya, moore. Fuseli, And, in leola's case, Millais' "the death of ophelia." It's in your hands now. You are the only voice those women have. Please, please, convict this man. Return a verdict that speaks the truth. Show him the same mercy that he showed his victims. None. Thank you. Well, it's a nice story, But I've got reasonable doubt On the chain of custody of the dna evidence. You know it's not consistent in all seven cases. Well, you muddied the water pretty well, But I have faith in the jury. I think I may be about to hand the great hailey dean Her first loss. That would be funny, Because you gave her her most wins. [door opens] [gavel bangs] You need to stand. We find the defendant, Clint burrell cruise, Guilty on all seven counts of murder in the first degree. [murmuring of shock, scattered applause] Don't worry. I'll get started on your appeal. I'm sure you will. You were very good. I look forward to seeing you again. Not where you're going. [chuckles] You think you're sending me to hell? I think nobody deserves to go there more than you. Finch! How about I send you to hell first? [taser crackles] [screaming] [gasping for air] [gasping in fright] no! No! [breathing hard] [cheering and applause] Toast! Toast! Everybody, settle down. Okay. This is particularly difficult for me, To say goodbye to a guy Saved my ass on more than one occasion. Garlan fincher, Who, um, who has decided To leave the wilds of atlanta For the more pleasant climes of afghanistan. [crowd murmurs in shock] At your age? Hey, I still got skills. We know about your skills. [laughter and hooting] To our colleague and friend, Finch, You will be missed. -Cheers. -Cheers. Cheers. I'll miss you... [chatting pleasantly] Hey. It's been months since the trial. And he's still in my head. I can't do it anymore, finch. I'm leaving the da's office. You can't quit because of One crazy scumbag. Try one too many crazy scumbags. I want to help people before they're killed. You're going back to therapy. Yeah. I got an office in manhattan. New york! Thanks for always being there for me, finch. Hey, I always will be. You better. [chuckles] [♪] [clears throat] Doctor. Doctor. Have a great day. You do the same. Oh, dana. You're here. You look shocked. I'm not always late. Yes, you are. Okay, I am. But last night, I went out for dinner, And it was wonderful, And breakfast was even better. Nice. Walter? Walter is so over. It's justin now. And he is? A broker at goldman's. Just met him Oh. Another dating website, I see. This one's for people Looking for their jewish soulmate. And you are looking for your jewish soulmate? This week, I am. That's my cup. Uh, I was, uh, making it for you. Oh, uh, celia polaski is your first patient. Thanks. What's the point? Of what? Of trying! If the campbell gallery Was prepared to show your work, Then it stands to reason that another gallery will. Clayton was my patron Ever since I got out of purchase. He was the only one that really believed in my art. He was your champion. Yeah, but he went ahead and died Before we could get the show off the ground. You could put a show up on your own. How? All you need is a space, right? I have a friend-- Who has a big home furnishing store Down on houston. Maybe you could put your art up there. I'm sure she'd be willing to take a look at your stuff. You know what, After we're finished here, I'll text her. What if she hates them? What if she doesn't? You can't give up On your art. It's the thing you do best. You gave up the law, And that was the thing that you did best. The law was a temporary detour for me. This is what I love. This is what I do best. Isn't it? Maybe. [chuckles] Thanks. [pills rattling] [cell phone chimes] Hey, finch! Hey, counselor! You know I like that I can still call you that. What are you working on today You can't tell me about? Same old, same old. Keeping the world safe for democracy. You okay? Yeah, just... I had the dream again. I wake up, and I can't breathe. I just feel his hands around my neck, you know? It's been two years. You'd think I'd be over it by now. The therapist needs a therapist. Guess so. Listen, hail. When cruise is executed next month, You will have closure. At least I won't have to see his face anymore. Excuse me, judge carter? Mr. Leonard. What you got there, matthew? Petition for a new trial. I'm eating my lunch here, son. I know, sir, and I am sorry about that, But my client's life is on the line. All right, sit down. Let's see it. Thank you. I'm okay, thank you. Cruise. Cruise! What is it? Someone to see you. I'm busy. Well... Is it enough? You're asking me my opinion on my own brief? I'm asking if you think this boy is innocent. You know I can't answer that. Open 36. [door locks buzz] Let's go. [matt]: I believe there is proof That there was inconsistencies With the dna evidence. Hell, three cases got thrown out Over evidence that was mishandled With the exact same atlanta p.D. Officers. All right, matthew. Give me time to read it through. I'll have a decision Later today. Thank you, your honor. [door locks buzz] I'll see him later on today... It's going to be at least 90 minutes. Okay, jenny... Cruise, How are you doing? They drop a needle on me in three weeks-- How do you think I'm doing? Oh, nobody told you. Okay, listen-- No, man, you listen. You listen. I've done everything that you told me to do. I waited, I waited through that trial. I've been waiting In that stinking cell. Why? Because you told me that everything would be okay. The appeal-- No more talk of appeals. I have been listening to you For two years, And what do we have to show for it? You get your fancy limousine, Me, I get potassium chloride, So don't you talk to me-- They're not executing you. What? [bailiff]: Cruise, if you could just sign here, We'll get you processed as quickly as possible. They're letting you go. You're a free man. [chuckles in disbelief] Where is everybody? Who? The tv, reporters, protesters. No one knows you're getting out today. The court went along with that? It's for you own safety. We keep out of the press for a few days, You find somewhere to stay, And we make a new trial date. There are a lot of people Who would like to see you dead, cruise. Relatives, boyfriends. They should thank me. Just watch what you say. Okay, remember, you are innocent Until proven guilty, Again. You really did it. You got me out. Yeah. I owe you. You're damn right. But she owes me more. Wait, what are you going to do? Don't you worry about that. You just get that new trial ready. You can't leave the state. Wait a minute-- Cruise-- It's okay. It's okay. It's okay! You've got a second chance here, okay? A real second chance. You hear me? Don't screw that up. I won't screw it up. [bus engine starts] [door hisses open] We'll be stopping here for a short break in florence. Please keep your tickets handy, folks. [engine stops] Hi. [shakes box of matches] You need a light? Oh, sure. [strikes match] Where you headed, up to raleigh? No, my sister in ohio. You? New york city. Hmm. Family? No. No, no family. I'm an artist. I've got a job that I'm doing. Wish I was going to new york instead of columbus. Oh, god, you'd love it, you really would. Beautiful woman like yourself, I think you'd fit right in. [chuckling] Maybe 10 years ago. Before I had my kids. No. Are you serious? You're kidding, right? You're beautiful. I don't want to be inappropriate, But the graceful lines Of your neck and your shoulders is... Perfect. How about that? You really are. You're like... You're like botticelli's "venus," you know? You know botticelli? No. Oh, my goodness, he's amazing. What you're saying sounds great. Keep going. Keep going. [gasps in fright] [muffled shouts] [calling out] [choking and gasping] You think you can kill my art, you bitch? Huh? You think you can-- My work! My art's eternal, you understand that? [choking] Don't you understand that? Don't you understand that? Why won't you try-- [bus horn blares, muffling scream] [daydream fades] What? I said, "keep going." Oh. Yes. Are you all right? Thanks. She's done it again. I thought the interview was going well, But then I hear my sister's voice in my head. "you'll screw it up, You always do." And I did. And there was tammy, gloating. What? I want to you to apologize to tammy. What? I haven't done anything to her. She ruined my whole childhood. What do I have to apologize to her for? She may have made your childhood terrible, But it's you who's giving those memories So much control Over your life today. I mean, it's just created a wedge Between you two. Those kids don't exist anymore. You can't let your past Have this much power over you now. I'll try. That's all you can do. Let me know how it goes. [♪] [chains break] [rebar whooshes through the air] [rebar clattering distantly] Perfect. [typing rapidly] You have one more to see today. What? No, I don't have anybody else-- 6'1", 185 pounds, Brown hair, Blue eyes... -Doctor. -Doctor. Ready to get sweaty? Oh, yeah. ...So little lexi reice says, "I know, that's why I do it!" And she launches her elastic bands From her braces Across the room, Hitting her brother, max, right in the side of the head. Oh, he's going to be in therapy. I'm sure a lot of future therapy patients Get their start in the dentist's chair. Yeah, getting my patients to talk Is sometimes like pulling teeth. Careful, I'll tell my union. At least I don't have to sedate my patients. Well, often. [cell phone rings] Okay, hang on. Patient emergency? Uh, no, it's dana. "how is it going?" She's very concerned about my social life. Hold on. Shoelace untied. [lace snaps] Ugh. Damn. [hailey screams] finch! [choking] How about I send you to hell first? What's wrong? Uh, nothing. I just got a really bad headache. Can we call it a night? Yeah. Okay. Tammy? I didn't wake you up, did I? No, I'm not in any trouble. I... I don't need money. Listen, I just wanted to say something to you. I'm sorry. For what? For everything. For blaming you for everything that's gone wrong in my life. [laughs] No, I haven't been drinking. I'm serious. I love you, And I just want us to be sisters again, That's all. So I'll see you at mom's on Saturday, right? [chuckles] Yes, I'll be there this time. [beeps phone off] [dials new number] [chuckles happily] [hailey's voicemail]: You have reached Mid-town therapy. The office is closed. Please leave a message. Doctor dean? Hailey? I did what you said, and... [laughing] I can't believe how good I feel right now. [screaming in terror] [muffled cries] [choking and struggling] [melissa falls silent] [shutter clicks] Morning! Hey. How was your run? It was good. You texted me last night. What was going on? I was out at finnegan's with justin And needed a rescue. It's not going well? All he could talk about Was his action figure collection. On to the next! Good attitude. Hold on. You were the last one out last night, right? I totally locked it. Oh, my god. Okay, don't touch anything. -What's going on? -We've been broken into. I locked it when I left, I swear-- Okay, Just call the police. Hey. You going to be all right? Yeah, I'm good. Go ahead and go. I know you have patients waiting. Look, about last night. I'm sorry if I said anything that upset you-- No, you were great. It's just... Headaches, And the weather change kind of made it worse. All right. Well, if you need me, you know where I am. Just across the hall, torturing children. Correct. Just follow the screaming. Thanks. Boss? Yeah? These gentlemen are here to see you. Oh, two detectives. I must rate. I'm sorry, have we met before? Uh, no. I've just worked around detectives Long enough to know what you look like. Really? I didn't think we were that obvious. You can't help it. Okay, so I came in around 8:45, Saw the place was tossed. The front door was open, it was unlocked-- Uh, sorry, excuse me. We didn't come here for that. Then why are you here? Um... [clears throat awkwardly] Do you mind if we talk alone for a minute, please? I'll be at my desk. Not touching anything. Okay, what do you want, detective..? Kolker. Ethan kolker, Mid-town division. Uh, miss dean, A woman was found dead this morning In the east side park. I'm sorry to tell you this, But the victim was your patient, melissa everett. What? How? Well, Do you really-- No, I'd like to know. How? She was strangled. Who would want to kill melissa? Well, we were, uh, Kind of hoping you might have a little insight. The last item in her date book was an appointment with you. Did you happen to see her after that? No. Mm-mm. Your office was also the last number Called from her cell phone. Do you mind? [beeps playback button] [machine voice]: You have one new message. [beep] [melissa]: Dr. Dean? Hailey? I did what you said, and... [laughs giddily] I can't believe how good I feel right now. [screams of terror] [static crackling] [beep] [clears throat awkwardly] Uh... Do you have any idea what was she talking about? What was that thing that you asked her to do? If you don't mind. It was just part of her therapy. You know that I don't have to give you Any information without a subpoena. Yeah, I-I know. Doctor-patient privilege. I was just kind of hoping you'd spare me that. But, all right, just the facts, then. What time did she leave here, do you know? No, uh... It will be on my client calendar. Which is missing. I have... Patient files... Some of them are missing. Miss everett's? Yeah. So its possible that the person that broke in here Wanted that file. Do you have any back-ups? I have personal notes at home. I could go through them And see if there's anything in there That could help you. Okay. All right. Thank you. Here. My office e-mail's on there. So, uh, let me know if you find anything. Thank you. My god. Melissa. Who would do something like that. Why her? I wish I knew. [choking] [gasps in fright] [breathing heavily] What is this? Names and addresses Of my patients whose files are missing. What about the files? You're lucky I gave you that much information Without their permission. [clears throat] So, why did you? Because I'm worried about their safety. What are you going to do about that? Uh... What would you like me to do? I'd like you to post men outside my office, Their homes. Okay, I'll see what I can do. Good. Did you, uh, get a chance To look at your personal files? Did you come up with any ideas On who might have wanted to kill miss everett? Yes, I looked through my notes. She never mentioned anything About a conflict or a grudge with anybody. Except her sister. So, she had a fight with her sister? No, she was just working through Some childhood issues. What about you guys, have you come up with any leads? [clears throat awkwardly] We're, uh... You know, we're working on a... Working on a theory. You like me for this, Don't you? Excuse me? What are you talking about? You know exactly what I'm talking about. You think I killed melissa. Is there any reason why I should think that? Why would I do that? I don't know. I'm not a psychologist. You're not much of a detective, either. Hey. Now, there's no need for that. You just accused me of killing a patient, A friend! I've done no such thing. I'm merely doing my job. That's all. You, of all, should know I'd be remiss If I didn't follow up on every possibility. [sighing] Look, if, uh, If you can think of anything else You might have forgotten... Yeah, I'll call you. I'd like to be kept in the loop on this, detective. Of course. I'll be in touch. Good. Hi. Hi. We need to talk. Hailey, the police have been here. What did they tell you? They said a patient of yours was killed, That it might be connected To a break-in at your office, That files were taken, including mine. Her name was melissa. I told them, just a day ago, I thought I saw her leaving your office as I was coming in. The day before she... [fighting tears] Am I a terrible person because I was worried It could have been me? If someone's coming after your patients, They have my file, too. Celia, that does not mean That anything is going to happen to you. But it could. I don't have any money to leave town. What am I supposed to do? Listen to me, You cannot live your life in fear, okay? Things like that don't just happen. They do. They happen all the time, hailey. [♪] [crowd murmuring in concern] [siren wails] Miss dean? I'm so sorry, but there's been a shooting. [sobbing quietly] Okay, bring in your art, And we'll put up a display next week. Okay. Thank you. [car speeding, horn blares] Hey! [muffled screams] It's okay, it's okay, it's okay. It's okay. Shh... No, no, no, no.... [choking] It's okay, it's okay, it's okay. Shh. Shh. It's okay... It's okay. It's okay... Shh, it's okay. Shh, shh. No, no, no. [hushing and shushing as celia falls silent and dies] [shutter clicking] I didn't see you around the office all day. Yeah, I canceled my appointments. I went to some of my patients' homes, The ones whose files were taken. How did that go? Well, the men all wanted referrals for new therapists, But the women are sticking with me. That's great. Hailey, are you doing okay? Adam, you know when we first met, I told you there were some things That I didn't want to talk about? You don't have to. You know you never have to do anything you don't want to. No. I have to. I... I was engaged when I was in college. Will batten. And, uh, three weeks before our wedding... My whole world changed. Will was murdered. Murdered... A shooting. He walked in on some guys robbing our apartment. Hailey, I'm so sorry. So I turned to law. Became a prosecutor. And why did you stop? My last case. Clint burrell cruise. He was a failed artist, turned murderer. He was the worst thing I ever tried. He killed seven women. Strangled them. My god. When cruise was convicted, I realized... I didn't want to spend my days looking at crime scenes, And my nights reading autopsy reports anymore. That's when I decided to come up here And to do what I had always wanted to do, Become a therapist. I thought that, you know, I thought I put all that pain and death behind me, But... Now, with melissa's killing, All those old feelings just keep coming up. Detective kolker. Excuse me, I'm sorry. Can I talk to you for a second? Can it wait until tomorrow? No. I'm afraid not. Okay, detective, what have you got? I got a second victim. It's celia poloski. Celia? No... Now, you didn't show up at work today. Can you tell me where you were For the last eight hours, please? I... I saw you, And I... I went and saw some patients out of the office, And adam and I went to the gym. Midtown health club. We signed in, you can check. Miss dean, You mind telling me where you were The night melissa everett was killed? What the hell are you saying, You think she did it? I care about melissa and celia. I'm sure you did. I'm afraid you're coming with us. [handcuffs rattle] [club music plays] Kevin? Dana! It is such a pleasure To finally meet you. Yeah. Your-your emails... [exhales] [chuckling] Yeah. Wow. May I? Just... Just... You need to change your profile picture. I do? Yes, you do. You absolutely do. It does not do you justice. You are absolutely beautiful. Wow! Seriously, um... You're incredible. I don't think I would call myself that. Why not? I don't understand Why people don't appreciate their own appearance. I mean, you are exceptionally beautiful. Trust me, I know. This is-this is what I do. I'm an artist. I-I know What real beauty is. You're perfection. Thank you. Don't thank me, thank your mom and dad. [laughs] They've got the genes, right? Excuse me. Hi. Can I have what she's having? Thank you. I want to know everything, okay? You're an executive assistant..? To a therapist. Wow. That's a good thing, that's maybe not a good thing. [laughs] Tell me about your boss. She's-- [glasses clinking] [laughs] cheers. Cheers. [remembering finch]: For every 20 we catch, Only one will make it to trial. Most will cut a deal with the da's office. I'm not interested in making deals with criminals. You're saying you're going to change The way the prosecutor's office works? That's right. Does it always smell like that in here? You should smell it in August. If you make it that long. I'll be here. You know, I think you will be. [door opens] Miss dean? That was cute. What? Making me wait here for three hours. Oh, well, I was... I was busy. Hmm. I think you were trying to rattle me. Really? Did it work? No. Okay. Let's see if this can shake you up a little. Miss dean? Celia poloski, Melissa everett. Now, each woman was killed Shortly after meeting with you. Both these women trusted you. Kind of makes them easy victims. That doesn't mean I killed them. Both strangled... And this-- A knot of string, Tied around their ring finger. You ever see anything like this before? You'd better watch Your chain of custody on that evidence, detective. Come on. We both know what this is. Each woman killed with the same modus operandi As your most famous case. Clint cruise. Have you checked his whereabouts? Yeah. He's still on death row in atlanta, Where you put him. So, who else could be so obsessed With your last case? I don't know. You tell me. I'll ask the questions. All right, then start. All I've been hearing is declaratory statements so far. Oh, I'm sorry. Is this moving too fast for you? Okay, well, Let's take miss poloski. You do admit That you went to visit her at her workplace On the day that she was murdered. Yes. Well, isn't that a little unusual, miss dean? 'cause, I mean, I've never had a doctor Visit me at work before. Maybe you've never had a doctor Who cared if you got better or not. You recognize The positioning of their bodies. Famous artwork. It took a day to figure these two out. So frederic leighton's "flaming June," And gustave courbet's "sleeping woman on a hammock." What exactly was the nature Of your relationship with miss poloski? What are you fishing for, detective? What, do you get some sort of sex thrill Out of it? Is that what it was for you, with these women? Some weird sex thing? Okay, you know what, you are a moron. Why are you wasting time Interrogating me When there is some killer out there Stalking my patients! Just calm down, miss dean. Please. Okay, you know what, detective kolker? I'm in here. I assume you've worked up a motive for me? So, let's hear it. The psych boys think you've cracked. Killed your own patients Using the exact methods of cruise, Who you became obsessed with during the course of your case. Huh. Thin. You deny having any emotional problems? You've been on prescription antidepressants Since the trial. You gonna bring in half of new york? There's also The positioning of the bodies, The knot of twine. Pull string. Right. From an artist's pencil. Stuff only you would know. Stuff anybody who followed the trials In the atlanta newspaper would know. [sighs] The string was from a davie wrap charcoal pencil. You ever own one before? No. It was wrapped around their ring finger, Like an engagement ring. You... You spent some time in treatment After your fiance died, didn't you? Was murdered. Wouldn't you? This is ridiculous. I just want to say something, This is the kind of investigation That used to make me cringe when I was a prosecutor. Your detective over here, He questioned me in the restaurant Without reading me my rights, So that'll be suppressed in court for sure. You guys are familiar with The "the fruit of the poisonous tree" concept, Aren't you? Yeah. Any evidence That flows from illegal beginnings Is no good? So, unless you fellas have any concrete evidence That links me to these crimes, I suggest you let me go. Now. Not yet. Do you recognize this? "hailey, always seeking sanity, love will." This pen, Given to you by your fiance, Was found in celia poloski's hand. This is your pen, isn't it, miss dean? Yes. Can you explain How it came to be in the victim's hand At the time of her death? No, I can't. There you go. Hailey dean, We're officially charging you With the murders of melissa everett And celia poloski. Officers? You'll have time to look for sanity On your ride over to rikers. You have the right to remain silent. If you give up that right, Anything you say can and will be held against you In a court of law... [handcuffs snap shut] [sighs heavily] Phone call? [mumbles] mm. You gonna call your lawyer? I am a lawyer. At least, I used to be. [call ringing] Come on... If you know me, you know where I am, And that you shouldn't be calling me now. The rest of you can leave a message. If I live, I'll call you back. Finch, I'm in trouble. Somebody is screwing with me. Somebody who knows my past. And it has to do with the cruise case. Call dana in my office. She knows where I am. You're very good. He had to be there. He's here. Okay, I've got to talk to detective kolker-- You got your phone call. No, you don't understand-- No, all I know is you've been processed And I have to take you back to your cell-- No, listen to me, it's really important. Can you just give him a message? I'll pass it along. Let's go. [punching in number] [ringing] [voice over intercom]: Hello? Hello! I've got a package here for hailey dean, But I can't read this suite number. [voice]: Miss dean's in 506. 506! Listen, you want me to leave it out here? Out front? [voice]: I'll buzz you in, sir. Thank you. [door locks buzz] Open 10. [door locks buzz] [sniffing] [muttering]: Hailey... E is. What? How? When? Four days ago. [scoffs in disbelief] Atlanta doj had a gag order on it Because of the death threats. They just released this information. Right now we're waiting for a report On his current whereabouts from his parole officer. So, that would make him Prime suspect in these homicides, right? Yes, it would. And the city of new york Is officially sorry For their mistake. [clears throat awkwardly] Why don't you just walk me to the door, detective-- Whoa, whoa, wait. Wait a minute. Just one more thing. What? How did your pen end up at the crime scene? I lost that pen years ago at cruise's trial. He must have picked it up, Put it by celia's body, sending a message. A message? Not for you, for me. He's coming after me. Are you okay? Uh, yeah, thank you for coming to get me. Well, it's beats hearing little debbie greene wail While I drill her teeth. My hero. Chivalry is not dead. I guess not. Take you home? Let me just stop by my house first, Then I need to go to the office. Are you sure? Yeah, I have work to do. Okay. Keep the change. Hey, can I come in? No, I'm okay. Oh. Okay. Adam, I think it would be best If you stayed away from me for a while. Look, if somebody is targeting my patients, Then nobody in my life is safe. Well, what are the police going to do about it? I've asked for surveillance. Hailey, I'm worried about you. Don't be. I can handle it, okay? I just... I just don't want you to get involved in this. I am involved, lady, And until the police give you some protection, I'm not letting you out of my sight. Thank you. I'll just be another minute, okay? Get yourself a drink. Thanks. Damn it, fincher, where are you? [dialing rapidly] [cell phone rings] Hailey dean? How's life in the big apple? Who let cruise out of jail? Well, he was granted a new trial on appeal. You did that? I was doing my job. He's a killer, matt. Well, the judge didn't agree. He tried to kill me In open court. Why didn't anybody inform me? [sighs] God, hailey, look, Someone from the da's office should have contacted you. At the very least, matt, You should have called me. You're right. I'm sorry. Look, where is he now? Unknown. He didn't report in to his parole officer. Well, We have two homicides here that match his m.O. My god. You think it's him. I think he's playing some sick game with me. Okay, what can I do from here? The police are dragging their feet On getting me an order of protection. I'll call, see what I can do. Okay. Midtown division. Detective kolker. Kolker. Got it. I'll call right away. Thanks. [beeps phone off] [remembering finch]: Okay, like I showed you. [shots blasting] Don't aim for the head, You're not freaking annie oakley. Aim between the belly and the neck, And keep shooting Until he goes down. I don't even know why I'm doing this. I have you. You're a prosecutor. There's gonna be people that want to hurt you, And I'm not going to be around all the time. Again. Reload. Finch... In the marines... Yeah? You killed people, right? Because I had to. Not because I wanted to. I don't know if I could do that. If you had been there... Will? Could you have pulled the trigger to save his life? To save a life? Yeah. I could kill. You just have to remember, Nobody wants to kill-- Except the people you prosecute. Again. [shots blasting] All set. Are you sure you want to go to the office today? Yeah, I'm sure. All right, well, I'm just down the hall If you need me. Okay. Dinner tonight? Asti's? Yeah. I'll meet you there. I can walk you there. It's okay. It's just across the street. I'll be fine. Okay. Okay. Oh, my god, hail, are you okay? Yeah. I got your message. I canceled everyone on the schedule today. Oh, hey, I went out with that guy, kevin, last night. I had the best time-- Dana, it's not that I don't care. It's just that I don't have time right now. [♪] [knocks hesitantly] Yeah? Can I go now? Oh. Yeah, I'm sorry. I didn't know you were still here. I'm supposed to see kevin-- You don't want to see him, I forgot. I'm sorry, dana. I've just been really busy. Kevin... Are you happy? Yeah. He really appreciates what's special about me, And I've never been with an artist before. An artist? Yeah, he even drew me. Can you imagine? Like how leo drew kate, Except in my apartment, not on the titanic. Show me. The picture? I kinda didn't have any clothes on-- Him. Show me him. That's kevin. Dana. I want you to go to midtown police station, okay? I want you to see detective kolker. You remember the man that came here the other day? And do what? Show him this. Stay there with him, don't go home. Don't go anywhere else, Do you understand me? I don't understand. Listen to me, I don't want you texting kevin. I don't want you calling him-- You're scaring me! You should be scared. He is not who you think he is. He is extremely dangerous, okay? Go to the police station. Go. [dialing rapidly] Detective kolker. No. Can you get him? No, don't give me his voice mail. Give him this message, okay? Personally. Tell him to call hailey dean. Important? Life or death. No... No. No... [screams] No, no-- [muffled screams] [shushing her impatiently] Shh, shh... [hailey falls silent] Shh... Hello, counsellor. Good. Very good. Should I put in the rollatini? Just give her a few more minutes. [dialing number] [cell phone rings nearby] [groans groggily] [cell phone's ring sharpens] [gasps in horror] [struggling] If it's important... I'm sure they'll leave a message. Found this. A smith and wesson chiefs special. I thought guns weren't your style. I prefer a brush, that's true, But different tools For different jobs. I've always fancied myself more of a renaissance man. But I've also always felt That every artist should be able to adapt. I can be whoever I want to be. You sure can't be an artist. I've seen your work. What is that supposed to be? You like it? This is my passion. This, This is my magnum opus. Look at this. This... This, miss dean, This is my masterpiece. "the death of cleopatra." And I'm supposed to be cleopatra? It's my art. You're a part of my art-- No, I don't want to be a part of your art. You're a hack, and you know it. What do you know? You and... And your fancy cars And your penthouse suites... The purpose of life, miss dean... Is to leave behind something That proved you were here. Well, this is mine! No... No, no, no, dana. Dana, dana... Oh, no. Why did you have to kill her? This was about me. Why did you have to kill her-- To hurt you! I thought it was hilarious That the police, those stupid cops, Actually pulled you in. [laughs] When I think about... All those people You put away for life. About what a bonus, You know, The grand and glorious hailey dean, Actually spending some time behind bars herself. How did that feel? Anybody who I put in jail was guilty, Including you-- Who are you to judge me? [whimpering in terror] When I am finished, You'll understand. [mumbling in protest] [choking and strangling] [gasping in terror] [choking and gasping] [screaming in pain] [chair smashing] [screams, kicks thud] [ripping off tape] You're a real ball-buster, dean! [laughing] I'll give you that. Whoo! [laughing in triumph] [smashing panel] [breathing hard] [whistles, teasing] There's no sense In delaying the inevitable any longer! You should thank me, you know! You and me, I'd say we had this... This date coming for a very long time. Hailey! You're beautiful, Just like all those other women! They thought they were beautiful! Thought they knew what love meant! But they were wrong! It's just some Shallow misunderstanding Of the transient value of their flesh! I showed them what real beauty is. Forever beauty, eternal beauty. Now the world will always remember them. They'll never forget them. I gave them forever! I can give you that gift. The world will never forget them! They'll never grow old! Today's your day! [stabbing] [groaning in pain] [shot blasts] [groaning] I don't plan on dying anytime soon. There will be more. We're not finished. What "we"? You can't stop us. You can't stop us... [sirens wailing] Hey. You got him. What? It's over. You got him. Yeah. I guess so. Miss dean. You want to tell me what happened? Caught your killer. You're welcome. [chuckles ruefully] I'm still gonna need a full statement in my office. Tomorrow morning. I know how to find you. Listen, uh, miss dean, I wanted to say, I... I just want you to know that I'm very sorry for... You know, everything I put you through. And, uh... I think this belongs to you. What? I'm just, I'm just happy you're alive. Hailey? In here! Hailey, I'm so glad you could see me. My god, so, you're okay, then? Oh, yeah. Have a seat. I heard about your harrowing ordeal. I'm just glad you made it. Have you talked to cruise yet? No. He still can't talk. He's lost a lot of blood, But... He's going to make it. That's too bad. It would have been easier for you if he didn't. What do you mean? The extradition. It's going to be a tough one, right? Yeah. New york and atlanta both want him. It'll be ugly, But I guess I'll just work it out. Yeah, you always do. Anyway, hailey, like I said, I'm just glad he didn't hurt you-- Before cruise passed out, he said something. He said, "we gave them immortality." "we." Why would he say that? Because cruise is crazy. He... He thought of himself as royalty. You know, he would use the imperial "we." He was always referring to himself in the third person. I don't think so. You want to hear my theory? I think he had an accomplice. I think he had somebody That made it possible for him to kill. Somebody that knew the system. Somebody who killed with him, protected him. And cruise told you this? Hailey, he's trying to confuse you. Obfuscate. No, matt, that's what you do. You would have gotten away with it, If it hadn't been... For this-- Cruise planted my pen at one of the crime scenes. There's no way He could have gotten it out of the courtroom that day Undetected. He went to jail and they searched him. That leaves you. You're the only one Who could have picked it up that day. I remember the look I saw on your face When the verdict was read-- I didn't realize it at the time, But you were happy. You wanted him convicted. You gave cruise my pen. [scoffing in indignation] Okay, look. He just... Wanted a souvenir. You gave cruise my pen Because you were his partner. Prove it. You were his lawyer on an assault rap 10 years ago. His first arrest. It was some hooker. I was preparing his defense and he just... Admitted that he was trying To work up the nerve to kill her. Then he started talking about his theory, The great works of art-- But you thought You would teach him better, huh? [shutter clicks] [shutter clicks] It's perfect. Let's go. [hailey]: You teamed up. You'd love to try and prove that, wouldn't you? I will. Actually, I'm thinking about coming out of retirement Just to try both of you. Cruise for dana, melissa and celia. And you, for the other seven women You guys killed in atlanta. How exactly? You don't have any hard evidence against me. Cruise does, though. He threatened to go public with it If you didn't get him out of jail. So you got him out of jail. But you still had a problem. A new trial might turn up some dna That belongs to you on those the crime scenes. So you had to kill cruise. But first, you needed him to kill me. Wow. I would love to see you try to make that fly in court. Only problem is, cruise isn't dead. I'm pretty sure I can convince him That he shouldn't take the fall on this Alone again. Another round of dna testing, matt, You're done. [sucks teeth resignedly] Well, that's too bad. You know... I started off... With small animals. Then I progressed to young girls, Just homeless, so... You know what I find fascinating? Is what you can get away with in society When you make more than 200k a year. It's like... People just want to trust you. So, what, you're going to kill me Right here in my office? What's the narrative on that? [voice heavy with tears] it's really quite sad, officer. I mean, I came in here, and she just got violent. She blamed me for her patients' deaths. And, uh, I mean, I was the one that got cruise his appeal, And I guess she was overcome With grief, or guilt, or... I mean, she attacked me. Then she pulls out this gun, and there's a struggle, And it just-- It just went off. Nobody's going to buy that. Oh, angel, I'm a lawyer, remember? You're a killer. Yeah, well, There's no sense in denying that now. Only you and I are going to know... You are the 11th victim. [shots blasting] [groaning in pain] You okay? Yeah. I think I'm deaf. But alive. [groaning] Did you get all that? Are you kidding me? Clearest confession I ever recorded. [sighs] Thank you, judge, for the warrant. Pick him up. You got the right to remain silent. If you give up that right, Anything you say Can and will be used against you In a court of law. If you don't have an attorney, on will be assigned to you. Took you long enough. I had to travel 7,000 miles In the back of a transport plane. Cut me some slack. Slack cut. So, what are you going to do? You ready to go back to law? Maybe. But first, I have an appointment with my dentist. Your dentist? Yeah. Thanks. I just have to put something away, Then I'm all yours. [♪] [monitors beep steadily] [telephone rings] Detective kolker. What? When? Cruise escaped! He killed a doctor. Listen up! I need an apb for clinton burrell cruise! Extremely dangerous! [sirens wail past] [♪]
