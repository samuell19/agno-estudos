Don't scare yourself. Run! [Guardian of the Palace] [Heishui Country.] [That's a place paved with gold.] [How elegant and magnificent it was back then.] [However, the prosperous world lost to a quick sand in the end.] [Heishui Country sank to the bottom of the sand overnight...] [and disappeared.] [All kinds of evil desires live with thoughts.] [All kinds of evil desires gone without thoughts.] [The Golden Moon Gem located in the underground palace.] [Since ancient times, that path is full of skeletons.] [Many people is gone forever.] [They're dying for fortune.] [Folks.] [We just arrived to this place.] [Sorry if our performances are not great.] [Support us with money if you can, if not, just cheer for us.] [There are many people who came here to do business recently.] [Our town is small,] [but everywhere is at war now,] [only our town is at peace.] [All businessmen from north and south came here to do business.] [Everything is sold here.] [Look, another troupe came here to perform.] -Ready? -Come and look, stone-breaking on chest! Come! Endure it. Nothing's wrong. His leg is harder than the hammer. -Again! -[Look.] [Isn't that Jiu Yue's fiance, Zhang Tian?] -[He looked so smart now.] -Hello, everyone. [He's under General Feng now.] [You need to call him as Lieutenant Zhang now.] Hello, everyone. Suddenly, at the northwest hillside, a group of people on horses appear. There're thousands of them. They went straight to Mobei Camp... and the defenders are caught unprepared. It all happens in a blink. At the east of the defenders, gunshots are heard, another group of people on horses appear. This round, the defenders suffer a crushing defeat. People can only see clearly at this time. In this army, everyone is holding a flag with the word "Feng". Just like that, Feng Pei Chuan's army defeated the defenders.... and became the new king of Mobei. Good! Good! Bring them more good wine. -Alright. -Young Master is back. Come here. Such a good dog. Give me. Jiu Yue. Come, Grandmother Liu's medicine jar is back. Continue to boil medicine for her. Alright. Come, let's continue. -Young Master, up. -Young Master, drink this. Let's drink, everyone! Cheers! Drink more. Tian Ya... Something happened at Heishui Inn! What? Young Master, take the medicine kit. Jiu Yue, let's go. Drink some water. Come, eat some. Da Han. When did this happen? What has she eaten recently? Two days ago, it started from her arm. I didn't care about it at the time. She only ate some porridge and biscuits. You'll be alright, Xiao Bao. Brother Tian Ya. How about uncle? He's fine yesterday noon. He only ate a few buns. I didn't expect him to be like this today. Jiu Yue, come here. Look, I guessed it right. It's really a plague. The disease spreads from the limbs to the whole body. There's no cure when it reaches the Baihui Point after three days. But this disease... has only been recorded in the history of ancient Heishui Country. Why the plague breaks out suddenly? General Feng? Zhang Tian, when did you come back? I've heard a lot about you, Brother Tian Ya. I came here to ask you to search for Golden Moon Gem. As I know, the Golden Moon Gem can cure the plague. I believe you two won't do nothing... and let the people of Heishui Town... die one after another. People is in trouble, of course I'll do my best. But I don't know about... the gem you mentioned just now. If there's nothing else, please go. Brother Tian Ya. You're looking for Chang Feng, right? I can help you. We'll look for him ourselves. Don't need to trouble you. Qiu Lu. -Master! -Father! Jiu Yue! Young Master, don't be afraid. I'm here. Mr. Wang has been invited to stay in my house for a few days. I know that the four of you have been to the ancient Heishui Country. Chang Feng is missing... and Mr. Wang is old. Only you two know about the location of ancient Heishui Country. Before you get the gem, I'll take good care of him. The lives of people in Heishui Town depend on you two. I can promise you... but I have a condition. Say it. My master once said that... the Golden Moon Gem is an auspicious thing. The soldiers have negative aura, they can't go near it. So, you can't go with us. Alright. You'll depart early tomorrow morning. I'll arrange someone to fetch you. Young Master, don't be afraid. [Can you stop?] [I...] [Master hasn't come out after so long.] [No, I must go take a look.] [Brother Chang Feng.] [My father asked us not to go.] [It has been so long, what if something happened to him?] [Yeah.] [You two stay here. I'll go take a look.] [No! We go together.] [Let's go together.] -[Let's go.] -[Alright.] [Master!] [Master!] [Father!] [Careful.] [Father!] [Master!] [Jiu Yue, go.] [Master!] [Master?] [Master!] [Father!] [Master!] -[Father!] -[Master, are you alright?] -[What's wrong?] -[Father, what's wrong?] [Master, don't scare me.] [What's wrong?] [Brother Chang Feng, what's wrong with him?] [You're save.] -[You're save, father.] -[Are you alright, master?] [Stop talking.] [Bring him out immediately.] [Alright. Come, master.] [Come.] [Let's go, master.] [Master, let's leave.] [Don't be afraid, you're save.] [Careful!] [Run!] [Father.] [Where's Brother Chang Feng?] [Jiu Yue, watch him.] -[Chang Feng!] -[Tian Ya!] [Brother Chang Feng!] [Brother Chang Feng!] Every time when you fail to find Brother Chang Feng, you'll come here and drink a jug of wine. It's the seventh jar. Since young, I lose to Brother Chang Feng in everything. I lose to him in sheep joint game. I lose to him in horse riding race. I lose to him in wrestling. I lose to him in sword skills. Even in drinking, I'll get drunk first. So, I swore... to beat him once. No matter in what. No matter what, I'll find him. -We'll go together. -It's too dangerous, you must not go. I don't care. I want to go with you. Even if we die, we must die together. Huang, take water to Young Lady Feng. Yes. -Jiu Yue. -Young Lady Feng, drink some water. Brother Tian Ya. Tian Ya. The utmost priority is to find the gem and cure the plague. I'll explain the others to you later. Brother Tian Ya, eat this and go. It's disgusting, I have no appetite. Tian Ya, don't worry. I've arranged people to take care of Uncle Wang. Tian Ya, what have you learned from your master in all these years? Story-telling, cure disease or see Fengshui? Astronomy and geography, Yin and Yang, Bagua, Medicine and divination, Astrology, ancient Chinese divination tradition, Fortune Telling. I learn everything that brings money. What's wrong, Lieutenant Zhang? You're interested in these as well? Let's go, Jiu Yue. Alright. Young Master, let's go. It's all gone. General, Young Lady Feng has departed. It's all gone. It's all gone. Brother Tian Ya. Brother Tian Ya! I ask you. Why do General Feng's willing to send his daughter to follow us? I'm not sure either. But when she passed by me just now, I felt strange. As if we knew each other before. General, we should depart now. I, Feng Pei Chuan, has been in war half of my life. I fought again when defeated. Finally, I came to this desert. I have no alternative. This is my only chance. Tian Ya, how much longer... to reach the entrance of the palace of ancient Heishui Country? We'll reach when it's time. Just follow me. Stop asking. Don't move! Don't move! Hand over all valuable things! Don't force me to take actions. Brothers. We're just passing by. We don't have anything valuable. Don't move! Don't move! Wu Nian, don't move! Run! Young Master, come back! Be careful of your dog life! Wu Nian, stop chasing them! Why are you so stubborn? Run! Run! Run! Hurry! Tornado. Run! -Young Master, run! -Run! -Hurry! -Run! Run! Run! Run! Run! Run! Hurry! Run! Hurry! Run! Run! Hide, hurry! Wu Nian! Brother Tian Ya! Brother Tian Ya! Everyone's alright? Let's go! What are you doing just now? Don't you know how strong the wind is? You're dead if you get blown away! Brother Tian Ya, are you alright? Wu Nian. Wu Nian, give me the whip! Don't move! Brother Tian Ya! Jiu Yue! Young Master, are you alright? Don't be afraid. Brother Tian Ya! -Jiu Yue, are you alright? -Yes. Young Lady Feng, are you alright? Yes. Let's go now. Otherwise, we'll be buried alive. -Young Master. -Young Master, let's go. Jiu Yue, here. Brother Tian Ya, why do I feel that something's following us? Don't scare yourself. We fell into the fire beacon tower of ancient Heishui Country. -You didn't come here before? -No. You broke in? What do you mean? Young Lady Wu Nian, listen here. We're not thieves. Don't need to explain it. Just bring us to the exit. -You! -Brother Tian Ya! Ms. Wu Nian. Brother Tian Ya, Brother Chang Feng, my father and I... are not thieves. Come out. Jiu Yue, hurry! Coming. Master. Father. When did you find out? We found out long ago. We've been following you for some time. Father, what's this place? This is the palace of ancient Heishui Country. This is the legendary palace of ancient Heishui Country? What are we waiting for? Let's go! Stand there. Nobody can enter. Why not? This is unfair. I'll go down first. You guys guard here and wait for me to return. Alright. Master. What is that? Gunpowder. The real entrance is inside. I'll come out after blow up the entrance. Careful, master. There're many treasures in the underground palace. But there're more danger too. How did your father find the entrance to the underground palace? Also, why did he go there? My father doesn't want people to kill themselves for fortune. -So, he blows up the entrance. -Jiu Yue, it's enough. What happened to him in there? I don't know. I didn't enter before. Oxygen level is getting low. We have to leave here quickly. But where's the exit? Come, over here. Everyone follow him. Everyone must follow closely and don't touch anything. Let's go. Young Master, stop barking. Come here. Let's go. The entrance is blocked. Brat, do you know the way or not? Do you know... we're out of food and drinks? We all have to die here. Huang, enough. Why are you anxious? Just remove the stone. Ask two people to help. You guys help me. Help me to move this away. Hurry! Use your strength. Come, this one. Brother Chang Feng. Come, use your strength. Brother Chang Feng. Brother Chang Feng! Come. Hurry and help them! Hurry. Brother Chang Feng! Brother Chang Feng! Tian Ya! Tian Ya, calm down! -Go away! -Help them! Tian Ya, calm down. There's still hope. Let's continue to find. Brothers, let's go. There's still hope. Everyone, stay vigilant and follow closely! The previous tornado took us off course. We just need to go upstream along this river. Lieutenant Zhang, we don't have much food and drinks left. Young Master, come back! This is the secret garden of Heishui Country Advisor. We'll reach the palace after pass through this forest. Everyone, stay close. Don't fall behind. Young Master, come back! Don't run around! Young Master! Young Master, let's go. Don't touch! Brother! Everyone must stay close. Don't fall behind. The closer to the palace entrance, the more dangerous it is. Let's go. Something's wrong with these plants. Don't touch anything. Let's go. Everyone, be careful! Run! Don't get caught! Go, hurry. Hurry! Wu Nian! Wu Nian! Wu Nian, are you alright? Jiu Yue, follow me! Young Master, over here! Wu Nian, hold on. We'll be out soon. Jiu Yue! Jiu Yue. Let's go. Wu Nian, hold on. We'll be out soon. Protect him until he finds the Golden Moon Gem. Father. Kill him then. Jiu Yue! Jiu Yue! Wu Nian, are you alright? I'm alright. Go look for Jiu Yue. Alright. We're the descendants of the advisor. Guarding the gem is our innate mission. Mother! You're awake? You inhaled the seeds of poisonous moss and fainted just now. After you eat my medicine, you'll be alright after a while. Take it. I heard that... alcohol is an escape from reality. Since young, I run away when encounter a problem. I'm an orphan. If not for my master, I'm dead long ago. When someone bully me, Brother Chang Feng will be the first one to help me. Sadly, he's gone. My master has lost his sanity. I swore to... take good care of Jiu Yue. But now... I'm so useless. Actually, I envy you. You envy me? Why? You got a master, a brother... and a good sister like Jiu Yue. At least you still have someone worth protecting. I don't have anyone except my godfather. I don't have siblings nor friends. My godfather is good to me... but I always feel there's a gap between us. You... You're saying... you're not General Feng's biological daughter? General. Lieutenant Zhang, where are the others? We're separated just now. Young Lady Feng might be with Tian Ya. Let's go. Hurry! I'm an orphan just like you. When I was very young, my godfather adopted me. I've never seen what my biological parents look like. I think... they should be dead. No wonder he'll let you come to such a dangerous place. I'm not saying he's bad. We're friends from now on. Come. Good friends. You're brave and kind. Let me tell you a story. [Jiao Jiao, come here!] [What's wrong?] [Come here!] [A snake.] [Jiao Jiao, what happened to your eyes just now?] [The snake became quiet after seeing you.] [It's on fire!] [Don't go! It's dangerous!] [No! I must find my mother!] [Help!] [Stay here, don't move.] [Hey! I'm afraid!] [I'm afraid.] [Help!] [Don't!] [Don't kill me!] [Please spare me.] [Jiao Jiao!] -[Because I'm afraid, since then...] -[Jiao Jiao, come back!] -[I've never seen Jiao Jiao again.] -[Jiao Jiao!] [If only I follow Jiao Jiao back then.] [If only I didn't leave Brother Chang Feng behind.] [My cowardliness made me lose a friend and a brother.] I wonder what happened to Jiao Jiao. I wonder if she's alive. Jiao Jiao? Yeah, Jiao Jiao. Do you know her? But your eyes... It's not safe here. Our top priority should be find Jiu Yue. Brother Tian Ya! -Jiu Yue. -Father. Don't be afraid. -Let's go. -Young Master, let's go. -Go and test it. -Yes! Haunted Swamp? Seems like you knew about this. Let her go. Wait! I'll do it. I swore to take good care of you. I won't be a coward this time. Brother Tian Ya. It's the flying serpent formation that we played when we're young. These pillars are arranged according to the flying serpent constellation. The Twenty Two Stars of Flying Serpent. North of Yingshi constellation, shape like a snake. The element of flying serpent is Earth. Shu Earth bad for Gui Water. Step on east, walk on Kan. Seven points to the left, lone tiger out of mountain. Pose like sparrowhawk. Five feet five inch to the right, the flying serpent find path. Tiger go through the forest, three whip rattlesnake. Bing Fire bad for Geng Metal. Step on southwest, walk on Gen. A boy toss ball, Kui Star turn direction. Point the stars, kick the moon. Point the stars, kick the moon? Point the stars, kick the moon. Father, I'll go. Remember my words. Come! Pluck the grass and find the snake, fish the moon from the water. Azure Dragon on the left. White Tiger on the right. Diagonal sleeves sway willow, hidden flowers. Seven stars fight over land dragon. Point to the sky and earth. Vermilion Bird on top, Black Tortoise at bottom. Go out from the Life Gate! Jiao Jiao? Jiao Jiao! You're Jiao Jiao! Protect him until he finds the Golden Moon Gem. Jiao Jiao! Jiao Jiao, do you remember me? -Hurry! Follow me! -Run! -Run! -Let's go! Follow me! We'll reach soon! Hurry! Jiao Jiao, are you alright? Tian Ya, open the door. Brother Tian Ya, you can't open the door. My father said it can't fall into the wrong hands. General. Brother Tian Ya. It's alright. Metal elements. Water elements. Fire elements. Earth elements. Wood elements. Let's go. Fire! Don't hit own people. Stop! Follow me! Young Lady Feng, let's go! Come! -Here. -Jiu Yue, follow me. Jiao Jiao, stay close. Jiu Yue. Lieutenant Zhang. Stand up! General. Let's go. What are these? I don't know. Jiu Yue, move! He's useless now. [The descendant of advisor?] [You're the descendant of Heishui advisor?] The descendant of Heishui advisor? Jiao Jiao. Stand there. [Why are you here?] [Tell me.] To take the Golden Moon Gem. Jiao Jiao, are you talking with it? [The descendants of advisor need to protect the gem for generations.] [Did you come to get the gem to restore the country?] I don't know what you're talking about. There's a plague in Heishui Town. Many people has died. Only the gem can save them. [Plague?] [Heishui Country has been asleep in the underground for a thousand years.] [Your ancestors believed that...] [as long as the Golden Moon Gem is here,] [Heishui Country will be able to recover one day.] [Whether you want to keep the gem here...] [while waiting for the chance to restore the country...] [or take it to help them,] [it's up to you.] [Jiao Jiao, do you know who is this?] [Ancestor.] [Yes, this is our ancestor,] [the advisor of Heishui Country.] [Although our country is destroyed,] [our ancestor has said that...] [as long as we have the Golden Moon Gem,] [we'll have hope to restore the country.] [Jiao Jiao.] [We must guard the gem for generations...] [so that it's not snatched away by bad people, alright?] [Alright.] [You're good.] [Don't go, it's dangerous!] [No! I must find my mother!] [Stay here, don't move.] [I'm afraid!] [Mother!] [Bring us to find the Golden Moon Gem!] [Keep dreaming!] [Mother!] [Mother!] [Bring her.] [General, this...] [You'll understand it in the future.] [A man who is never content is like a snake trying to swallow an elephant.] [In the end, he pursue a narrow gain while neglecting a greater danger.] Jiao Jiao! Jiao Jiao. Jiao... You want to take the gem just for your selfish desire. As long as Golden Moon Gem is here, it'll give life to here again... and fulfill the ancestral wishes. Jiao Jiao. What are you talking about? We take the gem to save the people in town. Jiao Jiao. You just covet the power of the gem and the treasures here. Golden Moon Gem belongs to Heishui Country. Nobody can take it! If compared to the restoration of the country, nothing else is important. Look at this. You and I are descendants of Heishui Country. Also Jiu Yue, my master and Brother Chang Feng. Our mission is to protect the treasure of Heishui Country... until the day when the country is restored. If so, your mission will be achieved soon. Jiao Jiao. If compared to the restoration of the country, the lives of the people in town are more important. If they're dead, it'll be meaningless even if the country is restored. Jiao Jiao. -[Is it nice?] -[Yes.] [I'll eat more then.] [Wu Nian, hold on.] [We'll be out soon.] [The gem has spirit, but no difference between good and evil.] [But people are unpredictable.] [All kinds of evil desires live with thoughts.] [All kinds of evil desires gone without thoughts.] [The vicissitudes of life depend on one's thought.] [The gem was left by your ancestors.] [If you insist to take it away,] [I won't stop you.] [You took the gem from me.] [My mission has ended.] [The fate of everyone here will be under your control.] How dare you snatch it! Give it back! Wu Nian! You killed my mother! Wu Nian. Duck! Let go! You let go! I won't! You let go! -You let go! -You let go! He ate the gem. You jerk, spit it out! I've waited too long for this day. I can finally fulfill my hegemony. End the war and a peaceful world. Aren't these... your wishes? Your mother and your master... are too stubborn. What did the people do wrong? Those insignificant people... are not worth mentioning. Besides, I gave the greatest value for their death! They die for good reasons. You jerk. Today, I'll show you... who's dying for good reasons! Spit it out! Spit it out! Young Master. It's going to collapse. Go! Run! Don't even think to leave. -Run! -Run! Young Master!
