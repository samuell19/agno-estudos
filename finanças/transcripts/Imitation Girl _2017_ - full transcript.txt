[thunder rumbles] [somber ethereal music] [cars hum] - [Boy] Hey, hey guys. - [Man] What's up. You got the stuff? - [Man] Yup. - [Boy] Alright, oh, baby. - [Man] What'll it be?

I got 17. - [Man] 17, alright, that'll do. - [Boy] Thanks, man. - [Man] Alright, man. - [Boy] Bye. [gentle guitar music] [somber ethereal music] [low rumbling] [bells clang] [gloomy string music] [bird squawks] [somber ethereal music] [Imitation gasps] [Julianna hums] - [Julianna] How'd it go? - You know, she sat on my face, which was this complete surprise but I think, in the end, it's gonna be kinda special. [pop music] - [Crew Member] Five minutes everyone. [rock music] - Jules. - Hey, baby. - Hey. [rock music] [pulsating dance music] - Hey. You should really lock the door, Jules. - It's a bad habit. [birds squawk] [somber ethereal music] [Imitation yells] [somber ethereal music] [Imitation groans] [somber ethereal music] - Hey. - Hey, Margueritte. - How much do I owe you? - Oh, um, it's three. - You okay? - Yeah, yeah, I'm fine. - [Margueritte] You can come out with us later, if you want. - Oh, okay, yeah, maybe. - Somebody should really cast me as your mother in a scene. Reality, you know, young guy, teenager, some mother daughter action. - Yeah, yeah. - Yeah. I'll bring it up to Larry. [sirens wail] [upbeat rock music] - Hey. - Have a good day. - Hi. - Hey. - What, are you covering for Theo? - Yep. - Baby? - Uh-huh? What? - Do you ever think about starting your own bar? - What? - I don't know, don't you want to? - Not really, no. - I think you'd be good at it. - Yeah, maybe I would. I don't know, that's something I'd have to think about, you know? Plus, I'm pretty happy with the way things are right now. You know? - Oh. - Rough day at work? Oh, come on, don't be sulky. - [Julianna] I'll be sulky if I want to. [toilet flushes] - Hello? Are you alright? Are you okay? [lock clicks] Tub, sink, toilet. [water gurgles] [gentle guitar music] Okay? - Okay? [speaks foreign language] [crickets chirp] [dog barks] - [Shygirl] Are you gonna finish that? - No, you want it? - You were really good in your scene today. - So were you, Shy. - I had to pee the whole time. - Well, you looked great. - Thanks. - Excuse me. Are you Richard Harrison's daughter, by chance? - Oh my god, Mrs. Phan. - I thought that was you. - Hi, Dorothy taught me piano for several years, way back when. - Oh, Julie Harrison. Oh, I almost didn't recognize you. - It's me. - Are you still playing the piano? You had quite a bit of Richard's talent, as I recall. - I never stopped. I play from time to time, when I have time [chuckles]. - Oh, I'm glad to hear it. You know, we're holding a competition this month for the conservatory's line up for next year. - The conservatory? - That's right. I would love to hear you play again. You did the Chopin "Prelude", right? Why don't you bring it in? We'll see what you got, you are Richard Harrison's daughter, after all. - It's an entrance competition? - [Mrs. Phan] That's right, for next year. - I'll do that. - Oh, good. It was very nice to see you, Julie. I hope you're taking care of yourself. - [Shygirl] She seems nice. - Mrs. Phan, Mrs. Phan? Hey, sorry, when? - Oh, of course, it's on the 21st at the conservatory on 7th Avenue. - Okay, great. - I'll add your name to the list and you can check in at the front desk. We start at 9 AM, okay? - Great. Thank you. - See you. [Khahar gasps] - Look after her today? I have to go to class. Just look after her today, okay? - Okay. [speaking foreign language] [urine tickles] [Imitation sighs] [toilet flushes] [Khahar speaks foreign language] [birds chirp] [Julianna sighs] [Julianna plays piano] - You know, things with my wife just haven't been the same but then out there on the field, goddamn it, I saw you and I knew, I want you. I wanna be in you. - That's your line, Julianna. - I'm sorry, I'm sorry, can we take it back? - [Larry] Alright, take it from my wife, Brian. - You cool, Jules? - It's okay, go ahead. - [Brian] Things with my wife just haven't been the same but then I was out on the field today and I saw you and I knew right then, I fucking want you, god. I wanna be in you. - I've never been with a man before. Will it, will it hurt? - [Brian] I'm gonna go straight for the end zone. - [Larry] Great, great, great, great. - [speaks foreign language] [gentle guitar music] [speaks foreign language] [women laugh] [women speak foreign language] And you cut... [gentle music] [speaks foreign language] [gentle guitar music] [Julianna sniffs] [muffled dance music] [muffled dance music] - With these mirrors, it's difficult to tell. You are aiming at me, aren't you? I'm aiming at you, lover. [dance music] Oh my god, it's so cold. [dance music] [dance music] [muffled dance music] [Julianna sniffs] - [Shygirl] Yes. - [Steve] Girl after my own heart, what's your name? - My friend's call me Shy Girl 'cause you know, I'm a little shy but my real name is Annie. - I like that. What do you do, Annie? - Well, I'm a performer, actually. Mostly a dancer. - [Steve] Wow, that's cool. I work in finance. It's very exciting. - [Shygirl] That is exciting, what kind of finance stuff? - [Steve] Hash fund trading, my firm has about 100 million in assets under management and we like to exploit whatever opportunities we can find in the market to get the highest active return or alpha. - How do you do that? - Do you have a half an hour for me to explain it to you [chuckles]? Two Macallan's on the rocks, please. It's all arbitrage strategies, we look at everything we can from stocks, bonds, mutual funds... - Thank you. I know where I know you from. Triple Exorcist, right? You're that girl, you're the possessed girl. - Satan, guide my cock. - [Both] Exorcize my cunt [laughs]. - You were so hot in that. [Julianna sighs] - Do you wanna split a cab? [gentle guitar music] [television chatters] [door thuds] - Hi. - Hi. Yesterday, I wasn't quite myself. - Oh. Okay. [Saghi laughs] [exotic music] - I like this body and I think I like whiskey. - I think I like it too. [exotic music] [cars honk] [sirens wail] [jackhammer thuds] - Hey. - Hey. Morning. - Morning. Sorry, this is all I've got. - Thank you. I need coffee. - Do you want me to go get some? - [Karen] Oh no. - Are you sure? - [Karen] It's fine. - I'm sorry. Not exactly a breakfast of champions. - [Karen] That's okay. - Sorry. - You live here by yourself? - Uh no, with my boyfriend. Things have kind of been... - I actually have to go. I want to see you again. Would you like that? - [Julianna] Yeah, yeah, I would. - [Karen] Bye. - Bye. [Julianna sighs] Fuckin' fruity loops. [birds chirp] - [speaks foreign language] [gentle guitar music] [gentle guitar music] [gentle guitar music] [gentle music] [gentle music] [door bell buzzes] - Shit. Hello? - [Karen] It's Karen. - Oh hey, come on up, door's open. Hey. - [Karen] Hey. - I'm sorry, I just got back from a shoot. - [Karen] I'm early, it's okay [chuckles]. - Okay, you can sit down, I just need to freshen up real quick and then we can go. - No problem. - Okay, can I get you something? - I'm fine. - A drink? Okay well, there's the bar, so help yourself, if you'd like and I'll be five minutes. - There's no rush, don't worry about it. - Oh hey. - You selling this? - Hmm? - [Karen] What the fuck are you doing? - Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, what the fuck, stop it, stop it, stop it, what the fuck! [toilet flushes] Are you fucking kidding me, what the fuck is wrong with you? - [Karen] Calm down. - What the fuck, you fucking psycho. What the fuck, are you gonna fucking pay for this? - [Karen] You should be thanking me. - What the fuck is wrong with you? Get the fuck out of my apartment, get the fuck out of my fucking apartment, get the fuck out, get the, fuck you, fuck you! You fucking psycho, fuck you! Fuck me, fuck! - It's not that I'm angry, Max, believe me, this shit happens 24 fucking seven, it's just I'm disappointed, consistently disappointed. Look, the freelance life is about the A's, availability, affordability, affability. You're definitely available, you're a part time fucking bartender, you were affordable, when you delivered and didn't cost me an arm and a leg having to make up for your incompetence. - [Max] I know, I'm really-- - Shut the fuck up, I'm gonna let this one go because it wasn't that much fucking shit but I'm going to politely ask you to step the fuck up because you're hardly my employee of the month right now, capeesh? So, I got another gig for you because I'm Saint fucking Nicholas, okay? - Great, awesome, thank you so much, Lou. I appreciate it. - [Lou] Let's go. - I won't let you down, man. - I'm sorry, Max. I didn't know. It was a stupid thing. I didn't mean to fuck anything up, you have to believe me. - [Max] Yeah. Well, you did. [gentle guitar music] [gentle guitar music] [gentle guitar music] - Ow, fuck! [Julianna sighs] [somber ethereal music] [bell dings] Oh, fuck! [muffled piano music] Excuse me, do you know where the bathroom is? [muffled piano music] - [Audition Judge] Please take a seat. What is that? - Oh, it's my music. - [Audition Judge] You're not off book? - No. - It's alright, Julianna, continue. [Julianna plays piano] Thank you, Julianna. - Fuck, fuck. [knock at door] - Julianna, how you feeling today? - I'm fine, Larry, how are you? - Great, great, great. So, we wanna try and get this in one take, okay, for the experiential guys, kind of a choose your own adventure thing. So, you're on a school trip with the football team. - Can I ask you a question? - Sure. - Do you remember why you got into this? I mean, instead of anything else, 'cause it was easy, 'cause of the money? I can't remember why I got into it, instead of anything else. I guess I just found me, you know, in the path of least of resistance or something. It's so simple, what we do. It's...it's so, it's so boring. We don't bring any beauty into this world. It's just sex, we don't bring anything of ourselves, it's just bodies. - Okay. You know what, you're being silly. Julianna, you're good at this. Now, I don't know about bringing beauty into the world or whatever the hell else, but you are good at this. Most people don't have the time or energy to think about bringing beauty into the world but you, you are lucky. You're good at something and people enjoy it. You know, it's not an awful way to spend your life. I've been doing it since I was a teenager. All I'm saying is, it's not so bad. Right? [gloomy string music] - Ready. [TV chatters] [pop music] - [Brian] Things with my wife just haven't been the same and I saw you out on the field and I knew, I want you. I want to be in you. - [Julianna] I've never been with a man before. Will it...will it hurt? [somber ethereal music] [somber ethereal music] [somber ethereal music] [car horns honk] [sirens wail] [somber ethereal music] - You're Julianna Fox. [somber ethereal music] - I don't have a twin. - No. - I've seen you, looking at me in the mirror. - I've been looking for you, for your face. - You've already got it. - You're a strange people, unique in this universe. I hope you know that. I've seen you as well. My not twin, my ether, the other of my selves. I've seen you through the looking glass. Would you like to see what's on the other side? [ethereal music] - Do you want some water? - Thank you. [ethereal music] I'm tired. Such a strange thing. A body that grows weak, why?
