Tom.. - Hello, ma'am. - Hello, preacher. - How are you? - I'm fine. Want to see the menu? No, I think I'll just have the usual. Alright. Kinda slow, isn't it? I hear they are calling for rain. I will cause distress onto men for they have sinned against the Lord. 'And their blood shall run out as the dust.' And their flesh... as dung. You have come among us to cleanse the world, my son. And by blood. H! Hello. I'm Dan... er, Dr. Daniel Potter. I had an appointment with Dr. -30 am. But my car broke down, I couldn't get to a phone. "'Hope I can still see him" I'm afraid you can't. Well.. Do you have any idea... when I might be able to see him? - You can't see him at all. - 'Why? Isn't he here?' - No, he's here. - Then.. You have any idea when he'll be free? - Leo's always free. - Is he free now? - He's always free. - 'Then why can't I see him?' Because he's invisible. 'Melody was a receptionist before she was admitted here.' It's good therapy for her. Thanks for coming to my rescue anyway. No problem. I felt the same way when I first got here. Everything seems turned upside down but when you see the results... - I know. - It's... Scumbag. His work is really incredible. It's like a miracle the way he gets through to people everyone else has written off. His methods may seem a little bizarre, but they work. I've been here since Leo founded the hospital six years ago. Feels like forever. Have you actually met him yourself? No-no, just on the phone. But I think we're gonna understand each other. Well, be prepared for anything. He's very unique. Leo? 'This is Dr. Potter.' I know. I know. - Great to see you, Dan. - Leo. Thanks. So now tell me. What are you experiencing? Well, actually, I... haven't had much of a chance to react yet. I was a little amused by your receptionist though. What happened? Nothing, it's just that when I asked if I could see you she said you were invisible. To Melody, I am invisible. Sounds like Bain is completely off the wall. That's quite possible. He does get results though. - Maybe that's your problem. - What's that? Maybe you gotta be a little crazy to be a good shrink. - Yikes. - Deb! God, Dan. It's alright, I'll just make another one. You know, a little bit of Krazy Glue and you'd never know this was broken. Better get Epoxy. 'What's the matter with Krazy Glue?' You could get your fingers stuck together. Then you'd have to go to the hospital. Come on, don't get serious. I am serious. I read about it in the National Enquirer. When do you read the National Enquirer? Wait a... wait a minute... will you wait a minute? Where does she read the National Enquirer? Don't ask me. I can't keep up with her. - What was this thing anyway? - Matching flower vase. What about these guys on the third floor? Guys on the third floor.. I-I don't know. I haven't met them yet. They sound like a pretty rough bunch though. I don't see why you can't have an office and treat neurotics like everybody else. Well, guess I just prefer psychopaths. What else can I say? As far as I'm concerned those men on the third floor are voyagers too. The state wouldn't let me keep them here unless I had maximum security. I said no. No way. I'm running a haven here, not a jail house. So we have this special security system on the third floor only. No bars. All run by electricity. Aren't these men still-still potentially violent? What do you expect? It's a violent society. Anyway, they've passed that point on their journey. They're working through other things now. Actually what I feel about all this crap is they are better off in there. Too scary outside. They wouldn't survive. - Hey, Leo. - What do you say, Ray. This is Ray Curtis. Dan Potter, Ray is the floor monitor. Hey, Ray. How you doing? How you doing? Everything alright today? So far. Hawkes set off the window alarm again last night. But, aside from that.. - ...everything is cool. - Good. - Good luck. - Thanks, Ray. Frank Hawkes. Frank Hawkes was a prisoner of war in Somalia. So it's important for him to feel that he knows the way out wherever he is. Hello, friends. This is Dan Potter. He's gonna be helping you along for a while. Where's Harry Merton? Dr. Merton had to leave to help people somewhere else. - 'Dan, this is Ronald Elster.' - 'Hi, Ronald.' 'Colonel Frank Hawkes.' 'Frank.' - This is Byron Sutcliff. - Hi, Byron. Byron used to be a minister. He's very deeply into his own space just now. Our friend over there is John Skaggs. 'That's the bleeder?' 'John doesn't particularly like to show his face to strangers.' 'Well..' Dr. Bain has told me how much you all admired Harry Merton. Unfortunately, he did have to leave and I'm here now. Well, I guess, I'll see you later. Dr. Potter! Happy... trails. I hear you, Frank. Potter... killed.. ...Harry Murton. Now.. ...Potter... wants to kill... us. He that smiteth a man that he die shall surely be put to death. We'll kill Potter when he comes back. - Not here. - 'Where?' - Outside. - We-we can't get out. 'We'll get out..' ...when the time... is right. Dan, I really wish you'd pick up Toni. You know, this is gonna be a tough day for me. She can get a taxi at the airport. I don't know if I can handle her myself. Come on. Sure you can. - Are you finished with this? - Yeah. The last time you saw Toni she wasn't feeling very well. No foolin'. Look, I've talked to her on the phone and I've spoken to her doctor. She's fine. She's probably... better off now than she was before the whole thing happened. I hope so. Breakdowns can sometimes be very cleansing. Why don't you give her a chance? She's a great girl, you know. Don't you think you better get dressed for school? - As soon as I finish. - When might that be? As long as it takes. I don't speed read, you know. Well, you better start. Free yourself up, Dan. Come on. Loosen yourself up. You're not at Payne Whitney anymore. We don't lock people up here and fry their brains with electricity. Sit down. People here aren't called patients. They are voyagers. Do you mind if I smoke? - No, not if you need to. - Need to? I don't need to. I... want to. Oregon sinsemilla. It's a great herb. Boy. You see, Dan, what the medical gang calls schizophrenics are people who've taken a journey into the inmost reaches of the psyche. Most psychiatrists haven't the guts to follow them there. But I believe in you, Dan. I believe in you. Always remember what the Hindu mystic said. Mind... moving fast... is crazy. Mind slow is saint. Mind stopped.. ...is God. Ray, this is quite nice. Quiet nice. Thank you. - Have a seat. - Sure. Would you, er, like some herbal tea? No, thanks. No, thanks. That's cool. Dr. Potter, Hawkes says that you killed the last doctor. So, they're going to kill you back. Okay. So, what are you gonna do? Nothing. What you described to me is pretty common among people in treatment. A man like Hawkes, I mean he's got a problem. Paranoia. He can't accept the fact that Harry Merton would leave for another job. Well, that all sounds fine in psychiatry class, Dr. Potter. But I'm telling you that these guys are very very intense, man. Check this out. Electricity, man. The only thing that separates me from them is electricity. Byron, hi. I need a match, doctor. You're not supposed to have matches, Byron. Leo let's me have 'em. Then you should go and ask Leo. I will send my anger upon thee and judge thee according to thy ways and recompense upon thee all thy abominations. - Hey, preacher, my man... - Don't you call me preacher. We can talk about this later. Okay, Byron. The end is come. It watcheth for thee. Fucking maniacs, man. My intestines come up out of my body. They wrap around the bed and grab me by the throat and try to strangle me. Excuse me. Leo, I need a match. A match? Sure. Keep the pack. Then I have to say the Lord's prayer backwards three times or else my body turns into porcelain. Well... Mave, this is what you do. The next time you feel your intestine coming out just... move your hands... in front of your face three times... like that. Yes and then the intestines will stay inside. And you won't turn to porcelain. I promise. Thank you, doctor. Excuse me, ma'am. Byron, Byron. Byron. Byron. Byron. Byron. Come here. Can somebody get him another shirt? - I'll take care of it, Leo. - Please. Leo. What was it you just say to him? I told him if he didn't stop all this nonsense I would hoist him up and cut him in half. Sometimes you have to be forceful with him. - Hi. - Hey, girl. - How are ya? - Fabulous. Look at me. You got a great house. And you got lots and lots of land that's really really good. You got any Rastafarians around? Who? Who? You know, reggae, Rastafarians. I'm into music now. Really into music. I started playing the drums. I met a guy. He's a guitar player... Wait, slow down, okay. Let's take your stuff inside. I'll show you to your room and you can tell me everything. Sorry, I'm just excited. No, don't be sorry. I'm excited too. C'mon. Excuse the mess. Looks great. - Where's Lyla? - She's at school. - She'll be home around three. - She know I'm here? Yeah! She's really excited. Put your stuff in this chest if you want. Sure. So.. ...how are you, hon? I'm fine. Really, I'm fine. There's no problem. - You look great. - Thanks. Hey, there's a dynamite band that's playing at Springwood this weekend. I was thinking of taking you and Danny to see it. What do you think? I don't know about Dan. If he doesn't wanna go, we could drag him along. We could go single. I'm really glad you're here, you know. Yeah, I know. Frank. Frank, do you have a minute? I have years, doctor. You were pretty close to Harry Merton, weren't you? Why? Harry says you were. Have you been in contact with him at all since he left? Why should I be? You're good friends. You wanna stay in touch. If we were friends, I suppose we might. You know where he is though? Some place in Philadelphia. Look.. I find this line of interrogation fairly... meaningless. What is your point? There is no point. Just wanted to touch base, that's all. You know, you shouldn't take. Ray Curtis too seriously, doctor. He's not very reliable. Why do you say that? He's too high strung. But that doesn't mean that he's a bad person. That's just his trip. Like Bain says. Fatty's trip is to rape little girls. Preacher likes to set fire to churches. That's his trip. Unfortunately, he does it when there are people inside. I'm here 'cause I enjoy the social life. There are no crazy people, doctor. We are all just on vacation. I hear that the Haven's really far out. No, no. The Haven is not far out. No, tell her about the bleeder, hon. I haven't seen my sister in over six months. C'mon. What's a bleeder? We rushed through dinner to go to this God knows... What's the bleeder? Remember, about three or four years ago this guy went around strangling everybody. When he did, he got a nose bleed. He's got him. He's got this other guy, a 400 pound child molester... 'Will you stop it' I don't wanna talk about work. I'd like to talk to my sister. Honey, she's gonna be here for a week. 'I'm not ready for this.' I wouldn't drive this far to see my analyst. C'mon, Danny. This is a really great band. They came all the way from New York to Springwood. You're gonna like them. They have a good reputation. - Who are they? - They're the Sic Fucks. - My God. - Danny, c'mon. They are good. - Are they loud? - Of course, they are loud. You can't appreciate it unless it's loud. - Hey. - Hey, how you doin'? - A. - Hey, that's my brother. It's 18 bucks. You cannot be serious. - They're crazy. - Definitely not. I have enough insanity in my life. I don't wanna pay for it. Bearable, bearable... barely, barely. Where the hell did she go? It's penetrating! 'What the fuck is going on here?' Well, God has heard my prayers. What the fuck! Come on. Shit! 'My God! It's a blackout.' What the hell is this? Danny, what if it's a blackout? Don't worry, sweetheart. It's not necessarily a blackout everywhere just because the lights went out here. I made the lights go out. 'Officials at the Fairwell Nuclear Power Plant' 'continue to deny rumors that the power failure' 'is due to a malfunction in the nuclear reactor.' They are lying. This is another Three Mile Island. We gotta get out of here. "'The blackout is either an act of sabotage or an act of God" 'Let's get out of here.' Shit. Shit! Hey, fellas. Hey. Hey-hey, we-we-we're friends, right? 'I mean, look, listen. I have stood behind you, man.' All the way down the line. That's the truth. 'I am your friend, alright?' Say away, stay away. Get back. Wait, wait. Hey, man. Look, look.. Don't man.. - This is a joke, right? - BLASPHEMER. That is right, that is right. I am a sinner, man. I-I-I that's the truth. His.. I'm a sinner, man. I-I know. I, look.. 'That's the truth, alright. Please, just forgive me.' It will be better not to give him glory when one of their great has fallen. 'He's become a harbinger of evil.' Evil, evil. Jesus. Let's go. Bunky, honey. Hi. - Hi, Mrs. Potter. - 'How's Lyla?' She's terrific. Phone seems to be working okay. We were watching TV in the kitchen. A little while later, the TV and everything just went dead. I am not able to get through to The Haven. You know. I hope they don't fix the blackout too soon. It's sort of fun. Hold it. Stay right where you are. - What's your business here? - I'm the doctor here. What's going on? - Two men were killed. - What? The auxillary generator conked auxiliary out and The Bleeder and a couple others just waltzed right outta here. Jesus. Who, who did they kill? - Well, the guard they had... - Ray Curtis? - Right and the doctor. - Not Bain? No, no, Larkin or something like that. ...where are the men now? All we know is they stole a car and they're wearing their hospital outfits. They shouldn't be too hard to catch. What the.. My God. What's wrong? - Do you see this ice cream? - That's the worst. That's ridiculous. Let's have a health fruit sundae. My God. 'Lyla!' God, you scared us to death. Why aren't you in bed? You've been smoking pot again? You know it's no good for you. Well. Why don't you go back to bed and we'll be more quiet. We promise. Aunt Toni will tuck you in. - Goodnight. - Goodnight. Are you afraid of the dark? - Sometimes. Aren't you? - No. - Not ever? - No. Maybe when I was a kid. I don't remember. When I was a little kid I was scared to death to be alone in the dark. I always knew that there was something I couldn't see that wanted to get me. In the closet.. ...or outside the window. But the worst thing of all was the thing under the bed. What kind of thing? I never knew. But I was terrified if my foot hung over the end of the bed, a hand or a claw would come out and grab me so I would wrap myself up in the blanket and make sure nothing stuck out and then, I knew I was safe. Then you must have been a pretty mixed up kid. Yeah, maybe. He's-he's bleeding. - Hi, everybody. - 'Hi.' - 'Hello.' - Have a good day. - See you later. I love you. - 'Bye.' That.. I want... that. What're you? Some kind of asshole? - Hi. - 'Hey, Nell.' - So, how you doing? - Incredible. So... what do you think? ...well, it's nice. - Nice? - Yeah. I mean, don't you think it's incredible? It's good. Don't you think it says something? Yeah. It-it does. It's good. Very good. You really wanna go to this demonstration? Yeah. There's gonna be state troopers there. You gotta stand up for what you believe in. Yeah, I know. Okay, so, how about a poster for me? This one is for you. Wait till you see mine. Okay. I have a telegram for Dr. Potter. Well, he's not in. I'll take it. I may only give it to him. I'm his wife. You can give it to me. - When will he return? - I don't know. Sometime this afternoon. You wanna come back later? You can rest assured, I will. - 'Can you believe that guy?' - Weird. Where do they get these guys from! Okay now. Please bear with us, everybody. And we'll be through as soon as we can. Has anybody seen David, Lisa or Sunshine? - I love the sunshine. - Shut up. Maybe you can help us. He loves me. I know he loves you. Everybody loves you, Judith. Okay. Okay, that's it. Thank you, everybody. 'You've been really helpful. You can go.' Alright, children. There's a barbeque on the lawn. Is that the Sibelius you're playing on that? Bye-bye, children. Bye-bye, Fred. Bye, Perry. Bye, Mavis. Bye. Bye-bye. Goodbye. So we're still missing six, Leo. Not counting the men from the third floor. Those men were moving along so well. Now, I suppose the authorities will close the whole operation down. 'They don't understand.' The men's violence is a cry of pain. But nobody hears it. The three men they murdered heard them, Leo. What exactly are you trying to say, Dan? Don't you think that you've lost sight.. They've killed three people, Leo. He has a point, Leo. Alright, they're crazy. Isn't everybody? Mom. 'Mom.' Where's my mother? She's not here. She asked me to take care of you till she gets back. Are you a babysitter? That's right. - Where do you live? - In Springwood. Your mother said we should go up to your room until she gets home. I don't wanna go to my room. Come on, cutie. Don't call me cutie. Uff. We can have a lot of fun up there. How come my mother called you instead of Bunky? Bunky wasn't home. You got paper in your room? Why? I-I'll tell you in a minute. You got scissors? I-I-I can show you how to make any kind of thing in the world out of paper. Finish your milk and we'll go upstairs. Okay? I promise I won't try to hold your hand again. Excuse me? Excuse me, officer? May I make a phone call, please. I've been waiting here for an hour now. - You'll have to wait your turn. - No. You don't understand. My girl's coming home from school. There's nobody to meet her. I'd like to call my husband. Lady, everybody's got problems. You should've thought of that before you broke the law. What do you mean? Come on. When this plant blows up, your ass is gonna go with it. Kids are gonna melt down. It's really... - Come on, missy. - I can take care of myself. I'm ahead of you for the phone. You can have my place. - You don't have to do that. - She'll go in my place. - Thank you very much. - Let's go. Make it quick. - What? You get hit by a cop? - Forgot to duck. My brother's a doctor, he should check it out. No. That's okay. No. Really. He should check it out. Hello. - 'Hi, Bunky. It's Dr. Potter.' - Hi. 'I'd like you to do me a big favor.' 'I'm stuck at the Haven and my wife's arrested' 'at the nuclear demonstration.' 'She can't get home for a while. We're worried about Lyla.' Well. I'll go see how she's doing. 'Great. Thanks.' Lyla. Lyla. 'Lyla's fine. She is napping.' - I didn't want to wake her. - 'That's great.' So, do you want me to stay until you and Mrs. Potter get back? 'If you wouldn't mind, it will be couple of hours.' That's no problem. Well, I'll-I'll see you when you get back. 'I'll see you and thanks really.' - That's okay. Bye. - 'I'll see you.' Bunky? Bunky? What took you so long? We've only got an hour now. - Hold it. - What's the matter now? - Didn't you hear that? - What? - I heard a noise. - Come on. Come on. I said stop it. - I heard a noise. - What kind of noise? I... I think it came from that closet over there. Well, maybe it's the cat. They don't have a cat. - So what am I supposed to do? - Well, look in the closet. - And then you'll be happy? - Yes. You want me to do anything else? You wanna hear the Gettysburg Address again? Please. Okay, okay. I mean, this is ridiculous. Okay? Billy? Billy? God. Open. He was nice. He made these little.. Dan, what happened? Hi, sweetheart. There's nothing to worry about. Just a scare. Detective Burnett.. - This is my wife, Nell. - Hi. Hi. What happened? One of the men from The Haven who escaped is here. - What? - Don't worry. Lyla's fine. He didn't do anything. He didn't do anything? He was here, wasn't he? Excuse me. I'll talk to you later. Actually, Lyla said he was very nice. He showed her how to make some things out of paper. Then, he went away, and she took her nap. Well, that's just great. Well, actually I'm.. I'm pretty relieved that that's all that happened. He didn't touch her or do anything. Why was he here then? I suppose he wanted to talk. He must trust me. What do you mean "talk?" You're having a tea party? Sweetheart, that's not doing any good. Hey, hey, hey. Tom, this is my brother, Danny. Danny, this is Tom. - Hi. Tom Smith. - Hi. How do you do? Tom's the guy that gave us a lift home from jail. - Lyla. - Howdy. As you see, he literally got busted at the demonstration. Looks like y'all have your hands full. - Guess I better be going. - Hold on. We told Tom he could stay for dinner. He's a real nice guy. He is nice. He gave me his turn, so I could call you. I wouldn't mind having another man here tonight. - Sure. It's fine with me. - Sure. We found two set of footprints going out the back. Then we lost 'em in the woods. Did the girl's car ever turn up? - Nothing so far. - Girl, what girl? Nobody seems to know where Bunky is. - My God! - Come on, Nell. She's probably out with her boyfriend. He did come by to pick her. Her mom must be going out of her mind. Sorry to bother you, Mrs. Potter but your husband's probably right. 'Under these circumstances, we have to be' 'a little more careful about things' 'that ordinarily wouldn't amount to anything.' If you should hear anything funny, just give us a call. We'll get somebody out here right away. Okay. Wait-wait a minute, Jim. We already have an extra plate for dinner so why don't you join us? You can handle it, can't you? - Sure. - Well.. C'mon, we make some good food. Why do you suppose Dan isn't answering? - Maybe they went out. - Where did they go to? You'd think in the circumstances the restaurants would all be closed? You're probably right. You don't think he's deliberately not answering because he thinks I'm trying to reach him. I wouldn't rule it out. He was being hostile this afternoon. Maybe he's acting out. Do you really think so? Well, I wouldn't take it personally. He was very tired. 'Yeah, I grew up in San Diego. Grew up sailing boats.' 'Got interested in racing tactics.' 'And then went to USC and majored in geology.' So that's when I first started getting interested in wind powers and alternate energy source. Turns out, an old buddy from Springwood had the same ideas so, here I am. - Making windmills? - Yeah, that's right. It's better than tilting at them. So you can actually run a house off a windmill? That depends on the needs of the house and how much wind you get. How much power does the average setup generate? 'How much power does the average setup generate?' - What was that? - What? That sound. Didn't you hear that? - Yeah, I heard it. - But what was it? I know, I know we're a little on the edge here tonight but let's take it easy, okay? And this is an old house. There are all kinds of sounds. 'They're in and out of this house.' And if we're anxious, we're gonna start to imagine that we hear things that aren't even there. It's like m-my mother. She hears sounds coming outta the TV. Everyone hears sounds from the TV. Not when it's turned off. Is that normal or what? Normal? I don't know what's normal anymore. Now, what was that? Excuse me, folks. Dave, you think we should call somebody for help? Take it easy, Mrs. Potter. There's plenty of time for that. You sure you don't want help looking around out there? No! Just wait inside. Can you see anything out there? No, ma'am. It looks pretty quiet. I'm just gonna check around front. Nick, no! What do you want me to do? He's bleeding. Hold it! Look.. I think we better protect ourselves, don't you? What are we gonna do? You check the windows in the library. 'I'll get the windows down here.' Toni, go to the kitchen, make sure the back door is locked and then check the windows upstairs. Nell, call the police. - What do I do? - You don't do anything. Stick with your mother and stay away from the windows. Get the windows in the library. 'No. Drapes aren't down there.' Danny, it's locked. Great. Now check upstairs. - There's no drapes in there. - Just lock the windows. Look, everybody, stay out of the library. It's dead. - Toni, are you okay? - Danny, I can't. - What? What? - I can't go up. - Tom, would you.. - Yeah, yeah, sure. - Honey, what's the matter? - N-nothing. - I'm sorry. - It's okay. Toni, it's okay. I was really scared. I think I'm gonna freak out. No. I shouldn't have sent you upstairs anyway. It's not the same as it was before. You are right to be upset now. I'd be worried about you if you weren't. Danny, I can't deal with this. You can. You can and you will. 'What is it?' What is it? Burnett, he... he isn't there anymore. I'm sorry. Everything's locked up tight. Tom. Burnett, he's gone. 'Danny, I need a Valium really bad.' - Where are they? - Upstairs. - Damn it! - I think I need one too. You don't need anything, Pudding. I'm really worried, dad. This is a very serious situation. Look, we're all worried, Lyla. Sometimes you just have to make the best of it. I'd rather take a Valium. Go block that window. - Block it. - Find something! The plates rack in the dining room. My God! Where are you going? Your Valium. That oughta keep 'em out for a while. 'I'm sorry, sir. I already told you.' 'The line is out of order.' I know, but what exactly did you mean by that? 'What I mean is, the line is out of order.' 'Don't you understand English?' There's no reason to be hostile. 'I wasn't being hostile, sir.' Thank you. Now, she has a serious problem. Don't you think we should call the police, Leo? Never. 'Alright, let's try to look at this thing rationally.' They're obviously armed. They're completely unpredictable and we have to assume that they aren't going away until they accomplish whatever they've set out to do and under the circumstances, I would say that's obvious. Well, maybe somebody heard us scream and called the cops. That's quite possible. And if someone tried to call us, they would discover that the lines were cut. Nah, cut line is an open circuit. The phone will ring but there wouldn't be any answer. Shit! Wonder where Burnett is? They're bound to call here. The problem with that, sweetheart, is that could be ten minutes, or it could be four hours. You'd.. We-we've gotta get outta here and get help or.. 'How?' The only thing I can think of is that somehow I have to get out there to the car. I'll go out to the car. 'No, I can't ask you to do that.' I can handle it. You should stay here with your family. What's that? I think.. It's a car. - It isa car. - My God, it's the cops. Wait here. My God! It's Leo Bain. Leo, get back into the car. Get the cops. We're under.. Get the cops. There you are. I was worried about you. Leo, the men from the third floor are here. They have weapons. There's something wrong with your telephone. 'Leo, the men from the third floor are here.' The men from the third floor. - Leo! - Get in the car! Are they inside? Out there. Out there, Leo. Great. I'll find them, and we'll talk. 'Leo, they have weapons.' Dan, you're going the wrong way about this. These people are still disturbed from their escape. Leo, for Christ's sake.. I want to get each and everyone of them back into his space in time. Hey! Hey you, hey! Hey, you guys out there, this is Leo Bain. Why don't you come out? We can explore a few things together. It's all over. He's outta his mind. Come on. This could be a very important time for us. 'Right now, let's use it.' 'Try to stay open to what I'm about.' My God! There's Byron. Leo, there's Byron! 'Leo, it's Byron.' Byron? Byron! Byron. Byron, you're looking great. How you feeling, Byron? My God! Look at him! 'Byron... Tell me, what are you experiencing right now? Watch out, Leo! I'm so glad this crazy outside world hasn't disturbed you. My God! Leo, please. Quick, get in. My God! Byron.. Remember the Ten Commandments? Byron.. God, said... "Thou shalt not kill." "Thou shalt not kill." "Vengeance is mine, sayeth the Lord." Tom.. 'Can you see what's going on out there?' I don't see anything. I-I don't know what to do. Honey, why is this happening? What do they want? It's me. I didn't even think of it. - What's you? - It's me. They think that I killed Harry Merton. Who is Harry Merton? Harry Merton's the doctor at the hospital before I got there. Ray Curtis was trying to tell me about it yesterday. Jesus! Get into the other room. Please get into the other room. - What's he doing? - I don't know. Frank, Frank Hawkes, can you hear me? Please get into the other room. I know you think I killed Harry Merton. I understand your reasoning. But it's not true, and I can prove it to you. 'Dr. Merton is at the Winfield Hospital' 'in Philadelphia.' 'If you call them up, they'll tell you that he's there.' 'I know that you believe in what's right.' 'And you'll fight for it.' 'But your thoughts are wrong.' 'Will you call?' You don't have to answer if you don't want to, Frank. You really think he's gonna call? I don't know. I don't know. Come here, Pudding. It's pretty hard to convince him. Paranoid schizophrenic, that his delusions aren't real. He could talk to Merton on the telephone and still think that it was just... an elaborate plot to deceive him. What about the others? No. It's Hawkes. Hawkes is running this show. Jesus Christ, it's Burnett. - Let's grab this. - Yeah. 'Fill that hole.' The window. 'This is what we're gonna do. We've gotta block this window.' Come on. Let's board up every window in this house. Hurry up! - 'Hurry, Nell!' - Hurry up! Here. Get her outta here. Will you get her into the other room? Go into the other room. 'Hurry!' 'Raise that table up in there.' - 'Get her outta here.' - 'Okay!' 'Will you get out of here, Lyla?' Get away from the window. What happened? - It came through the window. - What came through the window? But all the windows are closed. - It isn't real. - Is everything alright? What's happening to me? I'm getting sick again. No. No, you are not getting sick again. This is just your way of dealing with what's happening to us. - Now, try to hold on. - I'm trying. Look, you've not been breathing. Remember what I told you. Breathe deeply. Breathe deeply. Hopefully, we'll never have to go through this again. - Hopefully is right. - No kidding around. Who's kidding? They're in the basement. It sounds like they are in the basement. - Here. - No! - They're upstairs. - Get into the kitchen. 'Daddy, there's a fire.' - Where? - 'In the basement.' Christ! It must be Preacher. Where is the fire extinguisher? You're not going down there. Where did you put the fire extinguisher? I'd like to put out the fire in the basement. - Alright, stop screaming at me. - I'm sorry. Take care of them. I'm going down. Get rid of this chair. Put it back when I go down. Don't open the door unless you know it's me. Sure. It's me. Open the door. Alright. I'm going to the car, and I'm going to drive it to the porch. As soon as.. After I leave here wait for 30 seconds and run to the front door and be prepared to jump in the car as soon as I pull it up. Alright. - And take the flashlight. - No, don't need it. Come on, come on, come on! My God. My God. It's the bleeder. Mom! - Do it. - No! Do it. Pudding. 'So..' It's not just us crazy ones who kill. We all kill... doctor when we must. And we all die.. ...when it's time. Frank. Frank, please.. Just don't kill my family, Frank. Stay. Just-just don't kill my family. '...who escaped from the Haven Mental Hospital' 'during the first night of the blackout.' 'Police report the search continues.' 'For more on this, we have a special live report' 'from Jim Gable at the Winfield State Mental hospital' 'in Philadelphia.' 'Thanks, Cindy... That's Harry Merton. '...with Dr. Harry Merton, former assistant director..' That's Harry Merton. Merton, Frank. 'You worked closely with the four escaped psychopaths' 'during your time at The Haven, is that correct?' Jim, we really don't like to use the term "psychopath." It's a label that isn't very helpful in terms of dealing with these people. 'We prefer to call them voyagers.' 'Frank.' It's Harry Merton. 'He is alive. You see it?' Be quiet. '..Considerable difficulty integrating themselves' 'into so-called normal society' 'but they worked through that quite some time ago 'in a rather dramatic way, I would think.' 'But these men killed at least two people' 'during their escape.' Yes, and they were probably quite confused at the time. 'Aside from that, I'm absolutely certain that the progress..' That's... Harry Merton. 'Thank you, Dr. Merton. Back to you, Cindy.' 'Thanks, Jim. This just in.' 'Donald Hoover, vice-president of Columbia Power and Light' 'just concluded a press conference..' I guess we made it. You. It's a six-dollar cover. Hey, asshole. You gotta pay to get in. Hey, Face. You were here Tuesday night. You were standing by me at the bar, remember? Isn't this fuckin' band... really pink? Pink. I love 'em. So fucking angry. Hey, Face. You wouldn't dare. You know.. You really dare?
