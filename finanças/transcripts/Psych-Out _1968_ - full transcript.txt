No, I'm not kidding you. She can read lips, but I'll bet you anything she's deaf. What do you say, Elwood? Bad taste, man. [men laugh] Let's kill her and eat her.

But you don't have an address? There is no such thing as an address. It's the city dump. [psychedelic music] The Minister seemed like such a nice man. How can he stand these people and the way they dress? I've never seen so many... things. Things and more things that people spent their lives to buy. An output of a productive society, man. Junk.

[Stoney] I'm not getting near that stuff. They don't even know what's in it. [Elwood] They say it's LSD, cocaine and methedrine. It's like driving a Ferrari with the gas pedal strapped to the floor.

I'm not going to stop you from anything. Everything is cool. I'm going to take this with me, it's a shrine. I... I need it for meditation, the truth. [chuckles softly] The truth is in the fire. [Stoney] Listen Steve, your sister is here. You know what I just said? That's really true. You're a little high, so... Absolute concentration. You can see the flame. Your sister is here. We've been looking all over for you. Your sister is here. My little sister, Jenny? She's been trying to find you, man. You mean, that my little sister Jenny really made it? Listen, you want to come with me right now, man? I'll take you to her. Oh, no. No... I tell you what. You give me a day to get my head straight and I will come. Okay. Don't tell her you've seen me here. Okay. [chuckles] She was the... She was the sweetest little kid. Now, it's been a long time since I left her there. Where? Oh, at the house where we were little. I ran from the misery of that house as soon as I was old enough to. I left there the day that... [ding] The day that they took her things away. What things? -Just... -[bell dings] -Kids things, you know. -[bell dings] Things that a little kid collects. It was just a box of nonsense, but they were important things to her. They belonged to her. A treasure-chest full of inviolable personal belongings of incontestable ownership. I mean that those things were hers. They belong to her. You see, I had a mother, that was a very ugly woman. She had a fake awful voice. [inaudible] A patient voice. It was as stifling as the clothes that she wore. And she had a hatred for everything that grew or walked. Anything that had a chance in life, she hated. She had one of those knowing, understanding, forgiving smiles... Her touch was just like a stin. She was clever, too. She was clever at thinking up new punishments. And then... Then Jenny became like a... a wounded animal, a stricken animal. She was in a great deal of pai. She was snatching at air. When she grabbed hold of my mother's leg, she grabbed hold like she was grabbing on to save her life. She was actually grabbing on as if the limb was totally disembodied from her bitch enemy above her. [inaudible] Then it happened to her. Something terrible happened to her. She just didn't seem like a little girl any more. She seemed like a dying animal that was trying to run away from its pain. It was as if the most terrible thing that could ever happen to you.. had finally made itself clear to her. [music ends] And I... I don't really remember what I saw. [psychedelic music] Except... Something... black started sliding out of her mouth. Tendrils. Like she was trying to spew forth all of her hatre. [inhuman screeching] [screaming] I mean, talk about a lack of communication. People not being able to understand each other. Now, Jenny's got it made. Because since that day... that pitiful little thing has never heard a single sound.

Is it the fame or the fortune? Oh man... Dave, you bare relentless. Tell me your philosophy, Stoney. Let's talk about something important. What color Continental will you buy? Cantaloupe, man. That's interesting. Let me ask you this. How do you stand on monogrammed shirts? Love them, Mac, love them. Wear them for underwear all the time, you know. Anything with my initials on it. Individual against the "collective, conforming society" and all that. Well, I don't care what your bag is, man. As long as you're honest about what you want. Well, I'm honest, very honest. [Dave] Listen Stoney, what you really want is that little broad that just groped you. The one you made the date upstairs with. What you really want to do is... do that. But here comes Jenny. So, what are you going to do? Shall we be honest and tell her the truth? Or why not tell her you have a meeting with your agent and have to slip away? Or you tell her you love her? She'll never know. It's done all the time in straight circles. Hi. I've been looking all over for you, to congratulate you. [Dave] Go on, tell her. I'll back you up. -Hi. -Hi. Hey, why don't you come over and sit with me? I've got us a plate of food. You're all guts Tony, go and have your dinner. Yeah. Well, uh... Uh... I'm not real hungry right now, so maybe a little later, okay? Besides, I've got something else that I have to do. I think we've all got to do our own thing. Right? Man, what a free spirit. Well Jenny, I guess it's you and me. [people laughing] [laughing continues] [tense psychedelic music] [fast paced music] [music ends] You going to take that? Yeah, I'll take it. You kidding? Wow, I think you're... You couldn't have been getting too much from Stoney anyway. No. Right. [laughs] And now Stoney's off, having himself a ball. He sure is. You're going to sit here and be a martyr. -No, I am not-- -Now, why do people play games like that? Whether they made it with me is not the important thing. It's facing your appetites and your curiosity. I might be better than Stoney. Close your eyes. Hey, I can't close my eyes. Then I won't be able to see your lips. That's alright. Close your eyes. The Phantom strikes again. [laughs] See, now you're angry. You're angry at Stoney and you want revenge. Well I think anger is an honest emotion. So I'll help you get revenge. [Jenny laughs] Just beautiful. Damn it Jenny, what the hell is the matter with you? Hey, we've all got to do our own thing, remember? Shut up, Dave. Listen Stoney, nothing happened. Nothing happened? What do you call "nothing"? What happened? I get here a little bit too soon? [Dave] Hey, get this middle-class morality. Listen to the great free-thinker. Stick around Dave. I'll be finished in a minute. Stick around and have a ball. Damn it, stop it Stoney, stop it! [Dave] The moment of truth and you go square, Stoney. [Stoney] Not at all man, not at all. Use the pad. Have a ball. I don't care and I'm sure the bitch doesn't mind, do you, Jenny? Don't turn me off! I want to tell you not to dirty the sheets until I get another chick to clean them, that's all. [Dave] You're righteous, Stoney, but you're not very hip. Maybe I'm not. In any case, don't forget to crawl back in your hole when you're finished, man. [sighs] Reality is a rotten place to be. So, you want a shot of this? There's enough in there for two trips. [sobbing] Dave. Dave, I'm scared. Don't be scared. It's cool. You know... You know the only reason I came here was to find my brother. Oh, wait. How about this? "God is in the flame." What does it mean? I don't know, it's a little esoteric for me, but there's an address on the back. [sighs] I'm getting stoned already. Thanks! Reality is a deadly bore. [bell dings] Dave, where'd she go? She's far away. Come on, tell me. She's on a trip. A long trip. What are you saying? [sighs] She's gone to the end of the Universe, on STP. And she's out on the street alone? She's gone to seek The Seeker. She hides and you seek her. Hey! You sick, crazy bastard. Do you understand that she does not know that drug? And that something could happen to her? She could be hurt. Come on! [laughing] [laughing] Hey, what is it man? Drugs, or something? I don't know. He set fire to the house and he won't come out. Why'd he do that? I don't know. Why does someone jump out a window? -Hey! -Please, hurry! [all shouting] [Jenny] Steve? Don't! Steve! Steve, please... Somebody help him, help him! Steve! Steve, don't... Steve! Steve! No, no! Don't touch me! Don't touch me! No! No! No! No! No! No! Don't touch me! No, no, no! No! No! [psychedelic music] [music ends] [distorted music] -[loud, rapid, heartbeat] -[wind howling] [musical note zooming past] [distorted noises zooming past] [distorted car horns] [tyres screeching] -[screams] -[cars zooming past loudly] Jenny, don't move! Jenny, stay there! -[car honks] -[tyres screech] [car honks] Dave, don't! [Jenny screams] [tyres screech] [Dave screams] [somber music] Reality is a deadly place. I hope this trip was a good one.
