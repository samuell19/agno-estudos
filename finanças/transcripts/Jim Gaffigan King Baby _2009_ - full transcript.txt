( blues music playing ) ( crowd cheering ) YEAH YEAH YEAH YEAH YEAH YEAH! YEAH! YEAH YEAH! YEAH YEAH YEAH YEAH YEAH YEAH! YEAH YEAH YEAH YEAH YEAH YEAH! I JUST DO THIS FOR AN HOUR. YEAH YEAH YEAH YEAH! "THAT WAS THE WORST SHOW I'VE EVER SEEN! I PAID OVER $40. AFTER THE SERVICE FEE, IT WAS $90." CONVENIENCE CHARGE? CONVENIENT WAY TO RIP US OFF. ( falsetto ) HE'S LIKE PEARL JAM. HE'S TAKING ON THE MAN. HEY, WAIT A MINUTE. HE LOOKS LIKE THE MAN. HE'S KIND OF PUDGY. MAYBE HE ATE THE MAN. I DON'T EVEN KNOW WHAT MAN WE'RE TALKING ABOUT. I THOUGHT HE'D BE PALER. AT LEAST AS PALE AS THAT CD WHERE HE LOOKS LIKE A PEDOPHILE. ( cheering ) ( falsetto ) WELL, HE WAS GOOD IN "CAPOTE." HOW LARGE IS HIS HEAD? IS HE STORING ANOTHER HEAD INSIDE OF THERE? HE COULD BE A MASCOT. HE COULD BE A MASCOT FOR THE MORMONS. I'M ALREADY SICK OF THIS VOICE. WHEN'S HE GONNA START CRACKING IT? ( normal ) IT IS GREAT TO BE HERE IN AUSTIN. THANK YOU FOR COMING OUT. ( cheering ) GREAT TO BE HERE. I'VE HAD SO MUCH FUN HERE. I HAVE. I WENT BOWLING. I DON'T MEAN TO BRAG. REALLY, THERE ARE TWO TYPES OF PEOPLE THAT GO BOWLING. THERE ARE PEOPLE THAT REALLY REALLY LOVE BOWLING, AND THEN THERE ARE PEOPLE THAT ARE LIKE, "WOULDN'T IT BE HYSTERICAL IF WE WENT BOWLING?" 'CAUSE FOR MOST OF US BOWLING IS THE ACTIVITY YOU DO AFTER YOU'VE DONE EVERYTHING ELSE. IT'S LIKE, "WELL, WE COULD GO BOWLING OR WE COULD JUST HANG OURSELVES. WHY DON'T WE GO BOWLING?" NO ONE IS EVER JEALOUS WHEN THEY HEAR YOU WENT BOWLING. "OH, YOU WENT BOWLING? GLAD I COULDN'T MAKE IT." BOWLING'S GREAT. YOU GOT TO LOVE A SPORT YOU CAN EAT WHILE YOU PLAY IT. NEVER SEE THAT IN TENNIS. "HEY, BEFORE YOU SERVE, LET ME DIG INTO THESE NACHOS." IT'S A DIFFERENT SPORT. THERE'S AN ASHTRAY BUILT INTO THE BOWLING EQUIPMENT. POKER DOESN'T EVEN HAVE THAT. AND THAT HAND-DRYER THING? IF YOU'RE SWEATING WHILE YOU'RE BOWLING, YOU'RE OUT OF SHAPE. AND IF YOU'RE OUT OF SHAPE AND YOU'RE BOWLING, YOU'RE PROBABLY A PROFESSIONAL BOWLER. THERE'S NOTHING REALLY HEALTHY ABOUT BOWLING. IT HAS TO BE THE GERMAPHOBE'S NIGHTMARE. "HERE, PUT ON THESE MOIST SHOES 10,000 PEOPLE WORE AND STICK YOUR FINGERS IN THESE DIRTY HOLES. NOW YOU HAVE THE FLU." HOW DIRTY ARE THOSE HOLES? IT'S NOT LIKE THOSE BALLS WEAR OUT. THEY PROBABLY HAVEN'T MANUFACTURED A BOWLING BALL IN 1,000 YEARS. SOMEONE'S OUT THERE IS USING FRED FLINTSTONE'S RIGHT NOW. ( falsetto ) THAT IS PREPOSTEROUS. ( normal ) I DON'T OWN A BOWLING BALL 'CAUSE I'M NOT A WEIRDO. "YEAH, I WANT TO VOLUNTEER TO CARRY AROUND A 50-LB BALL. CAN YOU PUT IT IN A BIG UGLY PURSE? THAT'S HOW I WANT TO MEET THE LADIES." "OH, COULDN'T HELP BUT NOTICE YOU STARING AT MY PURSE. IT'S FILLED WITH A BIG BLUE BALL. MIND IF I FOLLOW YOU AROUND THE PARKING LOT? I'LL JUST BE HUMMING." ( humming ) â™ª BALL IN THE BAG. THAT'S THE WORST SONG EVER. I ALWAYS HAVE TO PICK OUT MY BOWLING BALL. I CAN NEVER FIND THE RIGHT ONE. I'M LIKE, "THIS ONE IS TOO HEAVY. THIS ONE IS GOOD, BUT IT'S PINK. AND MY FINGERS DON'T FIT." HOW DO THEY DECIDE ON THOSE FINGER SIZES? THEY'RE EITHER FOR A FIVE-YEAR-OLD GIRL OR THE INCREDIBLE HULK. HOW BIG ARE SOME PEOPLE'S FINGERS? SOME GUY WEARING A CATCHER'S MITT? "YEAH, IT'S GOOD. I CAN STILL CATCH THE GAME. DON'T WORRY ABOUT IT." THOSE BOWLING SHOES, NO UPDATE THERE. "YOU NEED OUR SPECIAL SHOES BEFORE YOU CAN ROLL OUR MAGIC BALL." SOME PEOPLE HAVE THEIR OWN BOWLING BALL AND THEIR OWN BOWLING SHOES AND NO FRIENDS. ( falsetto ) THAT'S MEAN. I CAN SAY THAT 'CAUSE I LIKE BOWLING. I WATCH BOWLING ON TV, 'CAUSE I USE MY TIME WISELY. I SAW THIS COLLEGE-TEAM CHAMPIONSHIP. EACH TEAM HAD THEIR OWN COACH. WHAT KIND OF STRATEGY ADVICE IS A BOWLING COACH GIVING? "YOU KNOW WHAT? THIS TIME, TIMMY, I WANT YOU TO KNOCK DOWN ALL THE PINS." "ARE YOU SURE?" "TRUST ME. JUST DO IT, SON!" THAT'S WEIRD. BOWLING SEEMS SILLY, YET WE ALL TAKE IT VERY SERIOUSLY, RIGHT? TILL WE GET THAT FIRST GUTTER BALL WE'RE LIKE, "LET ME SHOW YOU HOW IT'S DONE." ( laughs ) "THIS IS A STUPID SPORT." THERE'S FEW MOMENTS IN LIFE AS HUMILIATING AS THAT GUTTER BALL. THE WORST PART IS THEN YOU HAVE TO MAKE THAT TURN BACK TO YOUR FRIENDS. "THAT BALL'S BROKEN. IT'S TILTED DOWN THERE." YOU NEVER WANT TO BE THE WORST BOWLER OF THE GROUP 'CAUSE EVERYONE TREATS YOU LIKE YOU HAVE CANCER. "YOU CAN DO IT. WE'RE PRAYING FOR YOU." THE ADVICE STARTS: "USE A HEAVIER BALL. KEEP YOUR ARM STRAIGHT. YOU SHOULD GET A VASECTOMY." IF YOU'RE REALLY BAD AT BOWLING LIKE ME, THEY'LL ASK IF YOU WANT THE BUMPERS UP. IT'S NOT LIKE BOWLING'S THAT COMPLEX ANYWAY. "YOU WANT THE BUMPERS? WE CAN GET RID OF THE PINS. WHY DON'T YOU TAKE THIS COLORING BOOK AND SIT IN THE CORNER?" BUT I LIKE BOWLING. IT'S PERFECT FOR THE LAZY MAN. NO OTHER SPORT HAS A MACHINE THAT ROLLS THE BALL BACK TO YOU AT ARM LEVEL. "ALL RIGHT, I'LL KEEP PLAYING. IS THERE ANY WAY I CAN DO THIS IN A CHAIR OR SOMETHING?" I JUST PREFER THE EASY WAY IN LIFE. I DO. I SEE AN ESCALATOR, I GET EXCITED. I'M LIKE, "SWEET! ALL I'VE GOT TO DO IS KEEP MY BALANCE." PEOPLE LOOK SO BORED ON ESCALATORS. THEY'RE ALWAYS LIKE... ( sighs ) THEY SHOULD BE LIKE, "I'M GOING UP STAIRS WITHOUT MOVING MY LEGS!" I LIKE TO PRETEND I'M IN CHARGE OF THE ESCALATOR. TURN TO THE PEOPLE BEHIND ME, "YOU GUYS FOLLOW ME. STAND THERE, KEEP THAT PACE." EVER BEEN ON AN ESCALATOR AND SOMEONE STARTS WALKING UP BEHIND YOU? I'M LIKE, "SETTLE DOWN, WEIRDO. THIS IS ONE OF THE GOOD PARTS OF LIFE." HOW ABOUT THOSE PEOPLE THAT TAKE THE STAIRS RIGHT NEXT TO THE ESCALATOR? "WHAT ARE YOU DRUNK? THIS THING IS FREE. YOU DON'T NEED A TICKET." THEY'RE ALWAYS LIKE, "I'M TAKING THE STAIRS 'CAUSE I'M WATCHING MY CHOLESTEROL." THEN HALFWAY UP THEY ALWAYS HAVE THAT LOOK IN THEIR EYES: "I'VE MADE AN ENORMOUS MISTAKE. THESE STAIRS ARE HARD." THE ESCALATOR DEFINITELY MAKES YOU LOOK DOWN ON STAIRS. "YOU'RE NOTHING MORE THAN AN ORGANIZED HILL." THE ONLY THING WORSE THAN WALKING UP STAIRS IS WALKING UP AN ESCALATOR THAT'S NOT WORKING. "WHAT'S THE POINT? IT'S LIKE HAVING A DEAD BUTLER." COME ON. ( falsetto ) MY BUTLER DIED LAST WEEK. WE ALL LOOK SO CONFUSED WHEN WE ENCOUNTER THE ESCALATOR THAT'S NOT WORKING. "HOW AM I SUPPOSED TO GET UP THERE? I'M TRAPPED! HELP! HELP!" I DON'T LIKE IT WHEN THEY SEPARATE THE UP AND THE DOWN ESCALATOR. THEY DO THAT IN MALLS. YOU'RE LIKE, "HERE'S THE DOWN ESCALATOR, WHERE'S THE UP?" "OH, THAT'S CONVENIENTLY LOCATED A MILE AWAY. DID YOU BRING A CANOE? 'CAUSE THERE'S A RIVER." IT ALSO AMAZING AFTER ALL OUR TECHNOLOGICAL ADVANCEMENTS WE STILL CAN'T GET THE ESCALATOR HANDRAIL TO GO THE SAME SPEED AS THE ESCALATOR. "LOOKS LIKE MY HAND'S GONNA GET UP THERE BEFORE ME. SEE YOU UP THERE, HAND. I'D WAVE BUT I DON'T HAVE A HAND." THE MOVING SIDEWALK? THAT'S LIKE THE COUSIN OF THE ESCALATOR. THOSE ARE SWEET. THERE IS ALWAYS THAT MOMENT WHEN I'M GETTING OFF A MOVING SIDEWALK WHERE I'M LIKE, "HOW DO I WALK AGAIN? I HAVEN'T DONE IT IN LIKE 10'. LEARNING TO WALK AGAIN." YOU EVER FIND YOURSELF WALKING ON A MOVING SIDEWALK? YOU START PASSING PEOPLE. FOR A SECOND, DON'T YOU FEEL BIONIC? YOU'RE LIKE, DUN-DUN-DUN. "SEE YOU SLOWPOKES AT THE CINNABON." DUN-DUN-DUN. "HE'S LIKE A PROFESSIONAL WALKER. HE'S LIKE 'WALKER, TEXAS RANGER' WALKER." ( cheering ) HAVE YOU BEEN ON THE MOVING SIDEWALK THAT HAS THE ANNOUNCEMENT? "SIDEWALK IS ENDING." ARE WE THAT DUMB? WERE THERE PEOPLE STANDING AT THE END, "THIS IS GOING REAL SLOW NOW. OH, IT STOPPED? WHY DIDN'T THEY MAKE AN ANNOUNCEMENT? I DON'T HAVE TIME TO LOOK DOWN. I'M BUSY DAYDREAMING HERE." ( falsetto ) THAT'S JUST WEIRD. I WENT CAMPING RECENTLY FOR THIS NEXT JOKE. I MARRIED A WOMAN WHO LOVES TO CAMP AND I AM WHAT YOU WOULD CALL INDOORSY. I'M SURPRISED WE CAN STILL GET PEOPLE TO CAMP. "HEY, WANT TO BURN A COUPLE OF VACATION DAYS SLEEPING ON THE GROUND OUTSIDE?" UH, NO. "WHAT IF I TOLD YOU YOU GET TO CRAP STANDING UP IN THE WOODS?" I STILL WOULDN'T WANT TO GO. "YOU'LL WAKE UP FREEZING COVERED IN A RASH." ALL RIGHT, I'LL GO. MY WIFE ALWAYS BRINGS UP, "CAMPING IS A TRADITION IN MY FAMILY." HEY, IT WAS A TRADITION IN EVERYONE'S FAMILY TILL WE CAME UP WITH THE HOUSE. MY PARENTS NEVER TOOK ME CAMPING. YOU KNOW WHY? 'CAUSE THEY LOVED ME. "IT'LL GET YOU CLOSER TO NATURE." I WANT TO KEEP THE RELATIONSHIP PROFESSIONAL. IF IT'S SO GREAT OUTSIDE WHY ARE ALL THE BUGS TRYING TO GET IN MY HOUSE? SOME PLACES YOU HAVE TO PAY TO CAMP. YOU HAVE TO PAY TO SLEEP OUTSIDE. THAT'S GOT TO BE INSULTING TO THE HOMELESS PEOPLE. "HOW MUCH THIS COST YOU?" "I LIVE OUT HERE!" "THAT MUST BE REALLY EXPENSIVE." OCCASIONALLY AT THE CAMPSITE YOU'LL SEE THE WINNEBAGO. THAT'S KIND OF CHEATING, ISN'T IT? "OH, THAT'S WHAT I FORGOT. MY HOUSE." THERE'S ALWAYS THAT ONE COUPLE AT EVERY CAMPSITE THAT'S BEEN CAMPING FOR WAY TOO LONG. THEY HAVE THE FOLDING CHAIRS, THE CHRISTMAS LIGHTS IN JULY. "WE'D LOVE TO HAVE YOU FOR DINNER." I'M SURE YOU WOULD. NOW HOW DO I GET A PADLOCK ON MY TENT SO WE'RE NOT EATEN BY MA AND PA DAHMER? ( falsetto ) HAPPY CAMPER. HAS ANYONE EVER REALLY BEEN A HAPPY CAMPER? 'CAUSE WHENEVER WE USE THAT TERM WE'RE BEING SARCASTIC. "HE IS NOT A HAPPY CAMPER." WHY DON'T WE JUST CALL HIM A CAMPER? HE'S MISERABLE. YOU KNOW WHO'S A HAPPY CAMPER? THE GUY LEAVING THE CAMPSITE. HE'S THE HAPPIEST CAMPER. HE GETS TO TAKE A SHOWER. ( falsetto ) HE RUINED CAMPING FOR ME. TO BE FAIR, IT IS BEAUTIFUL DURING THE DAY. BUT AT NIGHT YOU'RE ALWAYS LIKE, "WE'RE ALL GONNA DIE! THERE'S MONSTERS OUT THERE. I SEE THEIR EYES." I PROBABLY WOULDN'T BE SO SCARED IF I WASN'T SLEEPING IN A BAG. "HEY, LET'S PREPACKAGE OURSELVES FOR THE SERIAL KILLER, HUH? I CAN'T GET AWAY, CAN YOU?" "I CAN HOP FOR A LITTLE, BUT I'M DEAD MEAT." YOU EVER HAVE TO GO TO THE BATHROOM IN THE MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT? YOU ALWAYS LOOK AT YOUR FRIENDS, "NICE KNOWING YOU. ANYONE WANT TO COME AND GET KILLED WITH ME OR YOU WANT TO GET KILLED LOOKING FOR ME? WE'RE ALL DEAD." IT'S NOT JUST SERIAL KILLERS. THERE'S BEARS OUT THERE. LAST TIME I WENT I GOT THIS PAMPHLET THAT SAID IF A BEAR APPROACHES YOU'RE SUPPOSED TO PLAY DEAD. REALLY? WE'RE GONNA RELY ON MY ACTING SKILLS? PLAY DEAD? WHO CAME UP WITH THAT? MAYBE THE BEARS? "PLAY DEAD, COVER YOURSELF IN HONEY, CLIMB ON A LARGE WHITE PLATE. DON'T TRY TO RUN AWAY FROM US-- I MEAN, THE BEARS." HOW DOES THAT EVEN WORK? "THERE'S A BEAR. UGH! I HOPE THE BEAR THINKS WE DIE STANDING UP." AS IF BEARS HAVE SOME ETHICAL CODE: "I DON'T MESS WITH DEAD BODIES. I'M A BEAR, NOT AN ANIMAL." ( falsetto) THAT WAS THE WORST IMPRESSION OF A BEAR EVER. PLAY DEAD. I'M NOT SAYING THAT STRATEGY DIDN'T WORK ONCE. BUT WHEN THEY FIND A BODY THAT'S BEEN MAULED BY A BEAR, HOW DO THEY KNOW THAT GUY WASN'T PLAYING DEAD? MAYBE HE WAS THE BEST AT IT. AND THE BEAR WAS LIKE, "GREAT PERFORMANCE, BUT I'M STARVING AND HE LOOKS LIKE A BURRITO." WHY ARE WE EVEN CAMPING WHERE THERE'S WILD ANIMALS? THAT WOULDN'T BE A SELLING POINT FOR ANYTHING ELSE. "IT'S A BEAUTIFUL GOLF COURSE, PLUS AROUND THE NINTH HOLE THERE'S A PACK OF WOLVES. IF THEY START RUNNING AT YOU, JUST PLAY THROUGH." THE ONLY THING I LIKE TO DO OUTSIDE IS LIE IN A HAMMOCK. THAT'S ALL ABOUT DOING NOTHING. IT'S HARD TO DO ANYTHING ONCE YOU GET IN A HAMMOCK 'CAUSE YOU CAN'T GET OUT. IT'S LIKE A GIANT NET FOR CATCHING LAZY PEOPLE. "I CAN'T EVEN DRINK IN THIS!" ALL YOU CAN DO IS RELAX. YOU NEVER SEE SOMEONE CRYING IN A HAMMOCK. "MY LIFE IS-- OH, THIS IS DELIGHTFUL." YOU EVER GET IN A HAMMOCK WITH SOMEONE ELSE? YOU'D BETTER BE DATING THEM, 'CAUSE IT LOOKS LIKE YOU'RE TRYING TO START A FAMILY. I GOT IN A HAMMOCK WITH MY COUSIN, HE STILL WON'T TALK TO ME. ( falsetto ) HE MADE THE HAMMOCK A DIRTY THING. I HAVE A NICE BED. I DON'T BELIEVE IN MAKING THE BED THOUGH. MY WIFE IS ALWAYS LIKE, "WHY DON'T YOU EVER MAKE THE BED?" FOR THE SAME REASON I DON'T TIE MY SHOES AFTER I TAKE THEM OFF. IT DOESN'T MAKE SENSE. YOU KNOW? WE'RE NOT PUTTING THIS THING IN STORAGE. HELL, I'M HOPING TO COME BACK IN A COUPLE OF HOURS AND I WOULD LIKE IT OPEN, 'CAUSE WHEN OUR BED IS MADE IT'S COVERED IN 40 PILLOWS LIKE WE'RE STOCKPILING AMMO FOR THE GLOBAL PILLOW FIGHT. I ASK MY WIFE, I'M LIKE, "WHAT'S THE DEAL WITH ALL THESE PILLOWS?" "THEY'RE FOR DECORATION." HOW OFTEN ARE YOU GIVING A TOUR OF OUR BEDROOM? AND HAS ANYONE EVER BEEN IMPRESSED BY PILLOWS? LIKE SOMEONE'S GONNA LEAVE YOUR BEDROOM, "I DIDN'T KNOW THEY WERE DOING THAT WELL. THEY GOT LIKE 40, 50 PILLOWS ON THAT BED. THEY'RE ROLLING IN DOWN." ( falsetto ) PILLOW JOKES? REALLY? IS THAT WHAT HE'S DOING? I DIDN'T KNOW IT WAS GOING TO BE SO EDGY. I DIDN'T COME HERE TO BE SHOCKED INTO LAUGHTER. EXCUSE ME. I HAD A BED DAY TODAY. YOU EVER HANG OUT IN BED ALL DAY? ANYONE ELSE DO HEROIN? NO? ( falsetto ) THAT'S NOT FUNNY. THOSE BED DAYS ARE THE BEST. PEOPLE RARELY VOLUNTEER THAT INFORMATION. "SORRY I'M LATE. I DIDN'T GET OUT OF BED UNTIL 5:00 P.M." "OH, WERE YOU SICK?" "NO, I WAS IN HEAVEN. JUST FANTASIZING ABOUT BEING IN A COMA." BREAKFAST IN BED. BREAKFAST IN BED, THAT IS A FANTASY. 'CAUSE IT GIVES YOU THE OPTION OF GOING BACK TO SLEEP WHEN YOU'RE DONE. "IT WOULD BE RUDE TO EAT AND RUN. I SHOULD STICK AROUND, SEE IF THERE'S LUNCH IN BED." AND EATING WHILE YOU'RE LYING DOWN IS BEAUTIFUL. TOO BAD HOSPITALS HAVE THAT SICKNESS REQUIREMENT, 'CAUSE I WOULD CHECK IN MANANA. "WHAT ARE YOUR SYMPTOMS?" "I'M HUNGRY AND I COULD GO FOR A NAP. STAT." OF COURSE WHAT MAKES BREAKFAST IN BED SO SPECIAL IS YOU'RE LYING DOWN AND EATING BACON-- THE MOST BEAUTIFUL THING ON EARTH. - ( cheering ) - BACON. BACON'S THE BEST. EVEN THE FRYING OF BACON SOUNDS LIKE APPLAUSE. IT'S LIKE... ( imitates applause ) YAY, BACON! YOU WANT TO KNOW HOW GOOD BACON IS? TO IMPROVE OTHER FOOD THEY WRAP IT IN BACON. IF IT WEREN'T FOR BACON, WE WOULDN'T EVEN KNOW WHAT A WATER CHESTNUT IS. "THANK YOU, BACON. SINCERELY, WATER CHESTNUT III." AND THOSE BITS OF BACON? BITS OF BACON ARE LIKE THE FAIRY DUST OF THE FOOD COMMUNITY. YOU DON'T WANT THIS BAKED POTATO? BRRRING! NOW IT'S YOUR FAVORITE PART OF THE MEAL. NOT INTERESTED IN A SALAD? BIPPITY-BOPPITY BACON! I JUST TURNED IT INTO AN ENTREE. BUT ONCE YOU PUT BACON IN A SALAD IT'S NO LONGER A SALAD. IT JUST BECOMES A GAME OF FIND THE BACON IN THE LETTUCE. IT'S LIKE YOU'RE PANNING FOR GOLD. "EUREKA! BACON!" NOT TOO MANY WAYS TO PREPARE BACON. YOU CAN EITHER FRY IT OR GET BOTULISM. IT'S AMAZING THE SHRINKAGE THAT OCCURS. YOU START WITH A POUND, YOU END UP WITH A BOOKMARK. REALLY THE ONLY BAD PART ABOUT BACON IS IT MAKES YOU THIRSTY FOR MORE BACON. I NEVER FEEL LIKE I GET ENOUGH BACON. AT BREAKFAST IT'S LIKE THEY'RE RATIONING IT. "HERE'S YOUR TWO STRIPS OF BACON." "I WANT MORE! MORE BACON!" WHENEVER YOU'RE AT A BRUNCH BUFFET AND YOU SEE THAT BIG METAL TRAY FILLED WITH THE 4,000 PIECES OF BACON, DON'T YOU ALMOST EXPECT A RAINBOW TO BE COMING OUT OF IT? "I FOUND IT! I FOUND THE SOURCE OF ALL BACON!" THAT BACON TRAY IS ALWAYS AT THE END OF THE BUFFET. YOU REGRET ALL THE STUFF ON YOUR PLATE. "WHAT AM I DOING WITH ALL THIS WORTHLESS FRUIT? I SHOULD HAVE WAITED. IF I HAD KNOWN YOU WERE HERE, I WOULD HAVE WAITED. I WOULD EAT ONLY YOU, BACON." BUT YOU CAN'T EAT ONLY BACON 'CAUSE IT'S TERRIBLE FOR YOU. YOU KNOW BACON IS BAD WHEN A HEALTHIER CHOICE IS A DONUT. BACON IS LIKE THE OPPOSITE OF MEDICINE. IT'S LIKE, "TAKE THAT, LIPITOR. I'M BACON." WE'VE KNOWN BACON IS BAD FOR US FOR THOUSANDS OF YEARS. IT'S LITERALLY A RESTRICTION ON ENTERING CERTAIN RELIGIONS. "OUR RULES: NO KILLING, NO CHEATING ON YOUR WIFE, NO BACON--" "WHOA WHOA WHOA. WHAT WAS THAT LAST ONE?" "NO BACON." "I'M IN THE WRONG LINE. IS THERE A BACON LINE AROUND HERE?" ( falsetto ) HOW MANY BACON JOKES IS THIS GUY GONNA DO? I MEAN, I LIKE BACON, BUT COME ON. THE PIG IS AN AMAZING ANIMAL. YOU FEED A PIG AN APPLE, IT MAKES BACON. I FIND THAT IMPRESSIVE. LET'S SEE MICHAEL PHELPS DO THAT, HUH? ( cheering ) THE PIG-- THE PIG IS TURNING AN APPLE-- ESSENTIALLY GARBAGE-- INTO BACON. THAT'S MAGIC, OR THE MOST SUCCESSFUL RECYCLING PROGRAM EVER. REALLY, THE PIG IS MAN'S BEST FRIEND. I LOVE DOGS, BUT PIGS WOULD BE GOOD COMPANIONS. THEN WHEN THEY DIE, YOU COULD HAVE A BARBECUE. "SORRY YOUR PIG DIED. CAN I COME OVER FOR BREAKFAST... AND HAVE SOME BACON?" BACON IS THAT GOOD. I BET IF YOU PUT BITS OF BACON ON A STRIP OF BACON, YOU COULD TRAVEL BACK IN TIME. IT'S LIKE A TASTY VORTEX. BE KIND OF REDUNDANT FOR ME 'CAUSE I WOULD JUST TRAVEL BACK TO WHEN I WAS EATING BACON. IT WOULD BE A BACON-TO-BACON TIME-SPACE CONTINUUM. ( falsetto ) THAT'S A NERDY-ASS BACON JOKE. FATBACK-- SUPPOSEDLY FATBACK IS LIKE BACON ON STEROIDS. I'VE NEVER TRIED FATBACK, PROBABLY 'CAUSE IT'S CALLED FATBACK. I DON'T KNOW WHICH WORD CREEPS ME OUT MORE-- FAT OR BACK. WHY DON'T THEY JUST THROW IN "HAIRY" WHILE THEY'RE AT IT? "THIS IS SOME DELICIOUS HAIRY FATBACK. THAT REMINDS ME-- YOUR UNCLE CALLED." ( falsetto ) THAT'S GOTTA BE THE END OF THE BACON JOKES. I EVEN LIKE THE NAME BACON. YOU CAN'T TELL ME THE SUCCESS OF KEVIN BACON ISN'T SOMEHOW TIED TO HIS NAME. ( cheering ) YOU'RE NOT GOING OUT TO SEE A KEVIN HOT-DOG MOVIE. "WHO'S IN THIS MOVIE? KEVIN BACON? SOUNDS GOOD." BACON! I LIKE MEAT, I DO. I LIKE ALL KINDS OF MEAT, EVEN BOLOGNA. ( falsetto ) I KNEW HE WAS WHITE TRASH. I DON'T EVEN KNOW IF BOLOGNA IS A MEAT. I DON'T THINK MEAT'S SUPPOSED TO CATCH ON FIRE LIKE THAT. WHAT'S INTERESTING ABOUT BOLOGNA-- IT'S NOT JUST A MEAT, IT'S AN INSULT. "THAT'S A BUNCH OF BOLOGNA. YOU'RE FULL OF BOLOGNA." THAT KIND OF IMPLIES BOLOGNA MAKES YOU LIE. I EAT BOLOGNA ALL THE TIME... OR MAYBE I DON'T. MAYBE THAT'S JUST THE BOLOGNA TALKING. HAVE YOU SEEN THE BOLOGNA THAT HAS THE OLIVES IN IT? WHO IS THAT FOR? "I LIKE MY BOLOGNA LIKE A MARTINI-- WITH AN OLIVE." I'LL HAVE THE BOLOGNA SANDWICH, DIRTY. EVERYTHING ABOUT BOLOGNA IS SILLY. WHO DECIDED ON THE PRONUNCIATION OF THE WORD "BOLOGNA"? "ALL RIGHT, HOW DO YOU WANT TO PRONOUNCE THIS WORD?" "BALONEY!" "I DON'T KNOW IF YOU SAW, THERE'S A 'G' IN THE WORD." "I DON'T SEE NO 'G' IN 'BALONEY.'" "OKAY, THE WORD DOES END WITH AN 'A.'" "WE'RE GOING WITH 'BALONEY'! TRUST ME, I CAME UP WITH 'COLONEL.'" I AM TRYING TO BE MORE RESPONSIBLE. I'M A FATHER NOW. THAT'S RIGHT. I BECAME A PRIEST. THANK YOU. BLESS YOU. IT'S INTERESTING. WHEN I WAS SINGLE, I NEVER REALLY SAW MYSELF AS A FAMILY MAN, BUT NOW THAT I'M MARRIED AND I HAVE TWO BEAUTIFUL CHILDREN, IT'S REALLY MADE ME APPRECIATE BEING ALONE. IT'S HARD. MY DAUGHTER'S FOUR. MY SON'S TWO. I TELL YOU IT'S EXHAUSTING WATCHING MY WIFE DO ALL THAT WORK. SHE SHOULD GET SOME HELP. I CAN BARELY NAP THROUGH THE SCREAMING. MY WIFE DOES DO EVERYTHING. IT'S HARD TO COMPLAIN AROUND THE MOTHER OF A SMALL CHILD. "YEAH, I DIDN'T GET MUCH SLEEP LAST NIGHT." "OH REALLY? I SLEPT FOR A MINUTE. AND I WAS BREASTFEEDING DURING THAT MINUTE." "THAT'S ROUGH. CAN YOU GET ME A BEER?" ( falsetto ) HE IS A JERK. TELL YA, EXPLAINING THINGS TO MY KIDS MAKES ME REALIZE HOW LITTLE I KNOW. RECENTLY MY SON POINTED TO AN ANTENNA AND SAID, "LOOK, DADDY, STICK!" I SAID, "ACTUALLY, THAT'S AN ANTENNA" HE GOES, "WHAT'S AN ANTENNA?" "IT'S A STICK. IT'S A SILVER STICK. YOU NAILED IT, BUDDY." I ALWAYS FEEL DUMB. IT DOESN'T HELP THAT MY WIFE SPELLS EVERYTHING IN FRONT OF MY KIDS. "DON'T TELL ANYONE ABOUT THE I-C-E-C-R-E-A-M." "WHO'S IN THE EMERGENCY ROOM? AND WHY DO I WANT A DILLY BAR?" 'CAUSE YOU CAN'T SAY THE WORDS "ICE CREAM" IN FRONT OF A FOUR-YEAR-OLD. THEY HEAR A COMMITMENT. "YEAH, I'LL HAVE ICE CREAM." "DADDY WAS JUST SAYING THE WORDS 'ICE CREAM.'" "I'LL HAVE IT RIGHT NOW. CHOCOLATE." I WENT TO A BIRTHDAY PARTY FOR A FOUR-YEAR-OLD. THAT WAS AWKWARD... PROBABLY 'CAUSE I WASN'T INVITED. THE CAKE CAME OUT. I LOVE HOW WE SERVE ICE CREAM WITH CAKE. "YOU KNOW WHAT'D BE GOOD WITH THIS SUGAR BREAD? SOME FROZEN SUGAR MILK. LET'S GIVE IT TO THE FOUR-YEAR-OLDS, SEE HOW THEY RESPOND. THEY'RE GOING CRAZY." MY SON'S BEEN WALKING FOR A WHILE. IT'S AMAZING. BABIES, THEY LEARN TO WALK AND THEY'RE ALREADY TRYING TO GET AWAY. "TIME FOR A BATH." ( mimics laughter ) "WHERE ARE YOU GOING? WHAT, YOU GOT AN ESCAPE CAR OUTSIDE? YOU CAN'T REACH THE DOORKNOB, YOU ONLY KNOW US; WHAT'S YOUR PLAN?" THINK IT THROUGH, BUDDY. THINK IT THROUGH. 'COURSE IF YOU HAVE A BOY, YOU HAVE TO DEAL WITH THE CIRCUMCISION QUESTION. MEN LOVE THAT TOPIC. "COULD YOU TALK ABOUT SOMETHING ELSE LIKE PRISON RAPE? ANYTHING." "CIRCUMCISION" IS A SCARY WORD. I LOOKED IT UP IN THE DICTIONARY. IT JUST SAID "OW! FROM THE LATIN FOR 'AH!'" WE WENT THROUGH WITH IT ONLY 'CAUSE MY SON REQUESTED IT. IT IS PRETTY CRAZY. OBVIOUSLY IT STARTED AS A RELIGIOUS TRADITION, CIRCUMCISION, BUT HOW'D THEY EVEN COME UP WITH THE IDEA? WERE THERE A BUNCH OF RELIGIOUS LEADERS GATHERED AND ONE GUY WAS LIKE, "ALL RIGHT, HOW SHALL WE HONOR GOD?" ANOTHER ONE'S GOING, "I SAY WE DON'T EAT PORK." "I DON'T KNOW. I LIKE BACON. ANYONE GOT ANYTHING ELSE?" "WHAT IF WE CUT OFF PART OF OUR PENIS?" "ALL RIGHT, NO PORK. WE'LL GO NO PORK. I WANT THAT MAN REMOVED!" MY WIFE TOLD ME THAT IN THE BIBLE ABRAHAM CIRCUMCISED HIMSELF. WOW. I CAN'T EVEN GET TO THE BANK BEFORE IT CLOSES. ABRAHAM DID IT. GOD TOLD HIM TO DO IT. I WOULD'VE LOVED TO HAVE OVERHEARD THAT CONVERSATION. "ABRAHAM." "OH HEY, GOD. HOW ARE YOU DOING?" "I NEED YOU TO DO SOMETHING FOR ME." "SURE, YOU'RE GOD." "I NEED YOU TO CIRCUMCISE YOURSELF." "I THINK WE GOT A BAD CONNECTION. COULD YOU SEND ME AN EMAIL? ARE YOU ON FACEBOOK YET?" I TELL YOU THOSE CHALLENGES IN THE BIBLE TOOK A LEAP IN DIFFICULTY. "DON'T EAT THIS APPLE. BUILD ME A BOAT. CUT OFF PART OF YOUR PENIS." "WHAT IF I BUILD YOU TWO BOATS?" HOW DID ABRAHAM EVEN TELL HIS WIFE? MAYBE HE DIDN'T. HE WAS JUST GETTING OUT OF THE SHOWER, SHE WAS LIKE, "WHAT THE HELL HAVE YOU DONE?" "HONEY, I CAN EXPLAIN. GOD TOLD ME TO DO IT." "IF GOD TOLD YOU TO JUMP OFF A BRIDGE-- IF GOD TOLD YOU TO SACRIFICE OUR FIRST--" "ACTUALLY, I HAVE TO TALK TO YOU ABOUT THAT ONE." YEAH, ABRAHAM, HE WENT THROUGH THE WRINGER. IT'S NOT LIKE JESUS HAD A CAKEWALK THOUGH. YOU THINK JESUS EVER TRIED TO TALK GOD OUT OF SOME OF THAT STUFF? "HEY, DAD, YOU KNOW THAT WHOLE CRUCIFIXION THING?" "YES, YOU'RE DYING ON THE CROSS FOR ALL MANKIND'S SINS." "YEAH YEAH, HEAR ME OUT. WHAT IF INSTEAD OF THAT WE DID A BIG FUNDRAISER?" "NO. NOW GET CRACKING ON YOUR MIRACLES." JESUS PERFORMED SO MANY MIRACLES. DO YOU THINK THE CARPENTRY EVER CAME UP WHEN HE WAS DOING THE MIRACLES? "JESUS, IF YOU COULD CURE OUR SON'S BLINDNESS-- AND WE'D LOVE SOME SHELVES RIGHT HERE. I DON'T KNOW IF YOU WANT TO DO THE BLINDNESS, THEN THE SHELVES. WE NEED THE SHELVES BY TUESDAY. OF COURSE WE'D LOVE OUR SON TO SEE THOSE SHELVES." POPEYE'S IS MY FAVORITE FRIED CHICKEN. I LOVE POPEYE'S. I LOVE THAT NAME. "OH, I GET IT. POPEYE WAS A SAILOR AND YOUR FOOD GOES THROUGH ME LIKE A TORPEDO. THAT MAKES SENSE. POPEYE ATE SPINACH AND NOW I HAVE DYSENTERY. POPEYE HAD MUSCLES; I CAN'T STAND UP." MAYBE THEY'RE NOT TALKING ABOUT THE CARTOON CHARACTER POPEYE. MAYBE THEY'RE TALKING ABOUT WHAT HAPPENS TO YOUR EYES AFTER YOU EAT THE FOOD. "I GOTTA GO TO THE BATHROOM." I EAT THE FAST FOOD, I DO. IT'S AMAZING HOW OUR ATTITUDE ON FAST FOOD CHANGES. WHEN YOU'RE A KID IT'S YOUR FAVORITE PLACE, BUT AS AN ADULT YOU LOOK AT FAST FOOD LIKE SOMEONE YOU USED TO DATE. "I CAN'T BELIEVE I EVER WENT THERE." THEN THE NEXT NIGHT, "WELL, IT'S LATE... AND I'M DRUNK SO..." WE'RE ALL SO EMBARRASSED TO EAT FAST FOOD. YOU EVER GO IN THERE, EVERYONE'S SITTING BY THEMSELVES, THEY'RE HUNCHED OVER WEARING A SKI MASK? "DON'T TELL MY WIFE I'M HERE!" THEY KNOW WE'RE EMBARRASSED TO EAT FAST FOOD. THAT'S WHY THEY INVENTED THE DRIVE-THRU. "LOOK, NO ONE HAS TO SEE YOU. JUST DRIVE AROUND BACK. WE'LL HAND IT OUT THE WINDOW." THAT DRIVE-THRU'S PRETTY CONVENIENT, RIGHT? EXCEPT FOR THAT FINAL STRETCH FOR YOUR FOOD. YOU'RE LIKE, "CAN YOU BRING YOUR BUILDING CLOSER TO MY CAR? DO I HAVE TO DO EVERYTHING? WHAT A PAIN IN THE ASS!" ( falsetto ) WHY IS HE REACHING OUT THE PASSENGER SIDE OF THE CAR? THESE FAST FOOD PLACES ARE SO FAST AND EASY, THEY'VE RUINED ME FOR REGULAR RESTAURANTS. WHENEVER I'M IN A REGULAR RESTAURANT, I'M ALWAYS LIKE, "LET'S SEE. I WILL ORDER THE HAMBURGER. WHERE IS IT?" "SIR, HOW WOULD YOU LIKE YOUR HAMBURGER DONE?" "RIGHT NOW. WHERE IS IT? AND CAN YOU WRAP IT IN PAPER SO I FEEL LIKE I'M OPENING A PRESENT? OR MAYBE PUT IT IN A STYROFOAM CLAM SHELL AND PRESENT IT LIKE AN ENGAGEMENT RING? I DO." TOO BAD ALL THE FOOD AT FAST FOOD PLACES IS SO BAD FOR YOU. I LOVE HOW THERE'S THE OPTION OF A MILKSHAKE. "I SHOULDN'T, BUT I'M IN A HURRY, SO I'LL GET A BURGER AND FRIES AND TO DRINK, I'LL HAVE THE LARGE CUP OF MELTED ICE CREAM. DO YOU HAVE AN E.K.G. MACHINE BACK THERE?" MOST RESTAURANTS TRY AND SET A MOOD. YOU GO IN THERE, YOU'RE LIKE, "I FEEL LIKE I'M IN A TUSCAN VILLA." FAST FOOD PLACES ARE BRIGHTLY LIT, SMELL LIKE DISINFECTANT. THE FURNITURE'S BOLTED DOWN. "WHERE AM I, A MENTAL INSTITUTION? WE GOTTA GET OUT OF HERE!" I LOVE THE FAST FOOD. I DO WISH I WAS THERE WHEN THEY DECIDED ON THE SIZE OF THOSE KETCHUP PACKETS. I'M NOT SAYING I NEED A GALLON, BUT MAYBE ENOUGH FOR MORE THAN ONE FRY. I ALWAYS END UP OPENING 20. I LOOK LIKE A HEROIN ADDICT. "I'M GONNA PARTY ONCE I GET SET UP HERE!" HAS ANYONE EVER USED JUST ONE KETCHUP PACKET? "DO YOU HAVE A HALF OF A QUARTER OF AN OUNCE OF KETCHUP? IT'S JUST SO DARN RICH. I NEED A RESEALABLE PACKET, ONE THAT I COULD STORE IN MY PURSE." THEY ALWAYS GIVE YOU THREE PACKETS. WHEN YOU GO BACK UP AND ASK FOR MORE, THE GUY HANDING THEM OUT ALWAYS TREATS YOU LIKE YOU'RE TAKING FROM HIS PERSONAL STASH. "LOOKS LIKE MY KIDS AREN'T HAVING KETCHUP TONIGHT. ENJOY, KETCHUP GLUTTON." SOMETIMES PRINTED ON THE KETCHUP PACKET IT WILL SAY "NOT FOR RESALE." I DIDN'T EVEN KNOW THAT WAS AN ISSUE. I'VE BEEN TO A LOT OF FLEA MARKETS-- NO KETCHUP PACKETS. YOU KNOW WHAT? IF YOU'RE IN A POSITION WHERE YOU HAVE TO SELL KETCHUP PACKETS, I DON'T THINK THAT'S GONNA HOLD YOU BACK. "WE NEED MONEY. MAYBE WE SHOULD SELL THESE KETCHUP PACK-- OH, WE CAN'T. IT SAYS 'NOT FOR RESALE.' DANG IT!" IF YOU'RE LUCKY, YOU'LL GET A KETCHUP PACKET THAT'S LABELED AS FANCY KETCHUP. KETCHUP, YOU'RE BEING MODEST. YOU'RE WAY MORE THAN FANCY. YOU'RE ELEGANT. I KNOW IT'S ALL RELATIVE, BUT WHAT KIND OF LIFE ARE YOU LEADING WHERE YOU CONSIDER KETCHUP FANCY? "WELL, WE AIN'T RICH FOLK, BUT ON SPECIAL OCCASIONS, I'LL BREAK OUT THE KETCHUP. GRANDMA'S BIRTHDAY, MAKE HER FEEL LIKE A CELEBRITY." ( falsetto ) KETCHUP. SOME FAST FOOD PLACES, THEY HAVE THAT KETCHUP PUMP. IT'S LIKE A KEG. THEY GIVE YOU THE PAPER SHOT GLASS. I ALWAYS LIKE TO HANG AROUND THERE, TRY AND MEET THE LADIES. "HERE, I'LL PUMP FOR YOU. YOU COME TO THIS WENDY'S OFTEN? MY ROOMMATE AND I, WE GOT A PONY PUMP BACK AT MY DORM. HERE'S AN EXTRA SHOT FOR YOUR CUTE FRIEND." HOW MANY SHOTS OF KETCHUP DO YOU GET? I USUALLY GET, LIKE, THREE, BUT IF I'VE HAD A BAD DAY, I'LL GET FIVE. MY WIFE THINKS I'M TRASH 'CAUSE I USE A LOT OF KETCHUP ON MY SUSHI. I FIND IT GETS RID OF THE FISH FLAVOR. HOW ABOUT THOSE PEOPLE THAT DON'T USE KETCHUP? WHAT ARE THEY CALLED AGAIN? AL QAEDA? UGH! ( falsetto ) KETCHUP. THE UPSIDE-DOWN BOTTLE OF KETCHUP, HAVE YOU SEEN THAT? DON'T YOU THINK IT'S A LITTLE EMBARRASSING HOW LONG IT TOOK US TO COME UP WITH THE UPSIDE-DOWN BOTTLE? IT WAS ONLY, LIKE, SIX MONTHS AGO. SOME GUY WAS LIKE, "YOU KNOW... WE ONLY USE IT LIKE THIS. WHY DON'T WE JUST PUT THE CAP ON THE BOTTOM?" "HAVE PEOPLE BEEN COMPLAINING KETCHUP IS HARD TO GET OUT OF THE BOTTLE?" "FOR, LIKE, 100 YEARS." "I'LL TALK TO OUR GRAVITY EXPERTS." KETCHUP. ( falsetto ) I NEVER THOUGHT I'D MISS A BACON JOKE. SALSA IS LIKE THE MEXICAN KETCHUP. MARINARA'S THE ITALIAN KETCHUP, AND BRITISH FOOD IS TERRIBLE. ACTUALLY VINEGAR IS THE BRITISH KETCHUP. HOW BAD IS YOUR FOOD WHEN ADDING VINEGAR IMPROVES IT? YOU KNOW WHAT I USE VINEGAR FOR? CLEANING WINDOWS. ( falsetto ) THE BRITISH ARE OUR ONLY ALLIES. WHY WOULD HE BE SO RECKLESS WITH HIS EDGY KETCHUP JOKES? YOU GUYS LOVE THE HOT SAUCE DOWN HERE, DON'T YOU? ( cheering ) YOU EVER NOTICE PEOPLE THAT ARE REALLY INTO HOT SAUCE ARE ALWAYS CHALLENGING YOU? "HEY, WHY DON'T YOU GET THE SUPER HOT FIRE-ENGINE SAUCE?" "'CAUSE I DON'T FEEL LIKE THE SUPER HOT FIRE-ENGINE DIARRHEA. HOW ABOUT THAT FOR A REASON, HUH? I'M NOT INTO WEARING DIAPERS, OKAY?" SPEAKING OF DIAPERS, I WENT TO WAFFLE HOUSE LAST NIGHT. I'LL TELL YOU, I THOUGHT THE IHOP WAS A DUMP UNTIL I WENT INTO A WAFFLE HOUSE. THEY'RE NOT EVEN TRYING IN THERE. HERE'S SOMETHING YOU'LL NEVER HEAR IN A WAFFLE HOUSE: "NICE JOB CLEANING UP!" NOW IF YOU'VE NEVER BEEN TO A WAFFLE HOUSE, JUST IMAGINE A GAS-STATION BATHROOM THAT SELLS WAFFLES, AND YOU'VE BEEN TO A WAFFLE HOUSE. I LOVE WAFFLE HOUSE. AND NOT JUST 'CAUSE WATCHING SOMEONE FRY AN EGG WHILE THEY'RE SMOKING REMINDS ME OF MY DAD. IT'S THE PEOPLE IN THERE. IT'S LIKE A WHITE-TRASH CONVENTION, OR FOR ME A FAMILY REUNION. IT'S SO WHITE TRASH IN THERE, IT MAKES THE IHOP APPEAR INTERNATIONAL. I'VE SEEN A GUN FIVE TIMES IN MY LIFE. THREE OF THEM HAVE BEEN IN WAFFLE HOUSE. THERE'S DEFINITELY A DANGEROUS FEEL TO 'EM. EVEN THE WAFFLE HOUSE SIGN LOOKS LIKE A RANSOM NOTE. THERE'S ALWAYS A LETTER OUT. OCCASIONALLY IT'LL BE THE "W," SO IT'LL READ "AFFLE HOUSE." "THAT'S WHERE I WANNA GO AT 2:00 A.M." THAT'S WHEN EVERYONE GOES. THEIR SLOGAN SHOULD BE, "IT'S 2:00 A.M., STILL TIME TO MAKE ONE MORE BAD DECISION." YOU GO IN THERE, EVERYONE'S DRUNK. YOU KNOW EVERYONE'S DRUNK IN WAFFLE HOUSE 'CAUSE THEY HAVE PICTURES OF THE FOOD ON THE MENU. HOW DRUNK DO YOU HAVE TO BE TO NOT REMEMBER WHAT A WAFFLE LOOKS LIKE? "OH, YEAH, IT'S LIKE A PLAID PANCAKE." "I'LL HAVE 12 OF THOSE FOR A NICKEL." YOU EVER GO INTO WAFFLE HOUSE DURING THE DAY? THAT'S WEIRD. "THIS PLACE LOOKS FAMILIAR. I THINK I THREW UP IN HERE. OH, THERE IT IS." ALL RIGHT, THAT IS ALL. THANK YOU SO MUCH, YOU GUYS.
