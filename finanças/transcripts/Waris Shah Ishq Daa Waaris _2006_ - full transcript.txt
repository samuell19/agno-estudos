Ripped by gdhaliwal23 Underlying the Indian ethos, lies a strain of music, ingrained as it were, in life's every facet, from birth to death.. It's music, gracing every occasion.. from changing of season's winds, to the festival of colors (Holi), the Night of Light (Diwali), seasons of sowing and harvest and indeed, for life's every moment.. There is music to it. Music reached its zenith during the reign of.. Emperor Akbar. The musician Tansen was one of the gems in his court It is believed that Tansen could bring rain by singing Raag Malhar And could light lamps by singing Raag Deepak 'Reminiscent, my heart' 'Reminiscent, my heart' 'Reminiscent, my heart' 'Whatever pleasure you wish' 'Reminiscent, my heart' 'In bad times nobody is your friend' 'Foolish man does not understand' 'Reminiscent, my heart' Aurangzeb's reign marked music's decline He believed, music distances man from God So he thought that it should be strictly banned. And Aurangzeb wrote a decree.. To stamp out music and musicians from his regime Hear one, hear all.. All eminent and common people hear this. By this royal decree.. Aurangzeb, the Conqueror of the World, ...forbids in his realm all song and music Anyone singing songs, of whatever kind be held captive.. ...and may even be hanged You dare to violate the royal decree ? You are under arrest Salah-uddin.. is my decree against music being implemented ? Majesty, it is being implemented. But many a Sufi has run away from cities Now in refuge in distant reaches, they won't stop their sly rebellion They are to be found and hanged. - So it shall be done, Majesty You foolish man, I am giving you advice.' 'l am giving you advice.' 'You are asleep, but God is awake' You are under arrest for violating the royal decree Who has died, whose coffin do you bear ? My Lord.. The Art of Melody The Music that you sentenced to death That Music we go to bury That infidel, so very astute.. ...it seems to return to life after every death Make sure to bury him so deep that it never raises its head again The Great Akbar died So also Aurangzeb passed But the ban on music continued In turn, Mohammed Shah Rangeela ruled then, Nadir Shah invaded India and Punjab, standing in the way of every invader was destroyed again and again The one central power dis-integrated and various rulers continued.. To suppress music in their own ways Learned Master, has music been buried forever ? No, many Sufi masters keep it alive, they will preserve music forever And Allah has created such circumstance.. ...in the life of a person.. | can feel his coming.. to Kasoor, searching for me.. He is the man, who shall bring alive music upon this land That one, even I am waiting for him, impatiently So long to journey's end Sir.. Where may I find Mohi-u-ddin Makhdoom sahib ? You do not look like a madman, but it's a crazy question you ask What seek you of him ? His kindness, I wish to be his disciple | see, you must be mad He is a Muslim but he speaks the language of infidels He dares to call himself a god. He sings, dances His followers are likely to incur the king's wrath.. Are you sticking your head out for the hangman's noose ? Go back For me, life and death are same But say, where can I find the Master? After the king banned musicians, these bards fled from cities.. To inhospitable terrain. If you have run into bad times, you may run into him in the jungles of Kasoor Makhdoom Baba (Baba: Father, Master) Makhdoom Baba! Makhdoom Baba! Makhdoom Baba! Waaris.. Baba...? So finally, you come ? Yes, Baba Come Welcome Baba ! Waaris, how I waited for you I regret your mother's passing But unless the mother, the one you loved the most.. Had not left you alone in this world, were it not for your family who ostracized you.. Would you have ever come to me ? Baba, you know all about me ? All that has come to pass and all that is to come Praise be to Allah Waaris, the world will remember me because you have been my disciple My Learned Master, despite all my flaws, you accept me ? Yes, come From now, whatever was mine is yours Waaris, you are adept at poetry But what you lack in, is passion, your lyrics lack a certain pathos, that reflection of personal anguish, or the universal Have you ever been in love ? That's what's lacking You can never make love come to be, it only comes to be It's God's gift You've not known the joy of loving, nor despair in longing Learned Master, that means, I have been drawing lines in water ? In your time, you too shall reap the riches of pathos Until then, patience I will, Baba Who among you is Makhdoom ? Faiyyaz Khan, so you have come ? Then do your master's bidding People of Kasoor say you practise music.. ...and you teach music, you sing, dance.. And you even claim to be a god ?Is that true ? Faiyyaz Khan, in love, the devotee attains Allah When the veil is lifted from your eyes, you too are God You are under arrest I know Waaris, for the droplet to merge with the Ocean, now comes the time.. For the lover to meet his beloved Come on. Untie him Makhdoom, there's still time for you to confess and repent Tell your disciples, what you spoke of was rebellion I may still be kind upon you I may spare your life 'The free spirit bows not before might' 'Like free stars, in skies of the night' 'Like a free river, running to seas' 'In the seas, end all mighty rivers' 'But oceans never flow into rivers' 'The droplet mingles with seas, the Ocean it becomes' 'The droplet mingles with seas, the Ocean it becomes' 'In loving embrace of Death, freed the Spirit becomes' 'The droplet mingles with seas, the Ocean it becomes' 'The world is transient, what is, will come to an end' 'Love, only love lives, it's Allah's gift to us who live' 'The world is transient, what is, will come to an end' 'Love, only love lives, it's Allah's gift to us who live' 'l love so much, I even love Death' 'Then Death is no punishment, if you have faith' 'Then Death is no punishment, if you have faith' 'The droplet mingles with seas, the Ocean it becomes' 'In loving embrace of Death, freed the Spirit becomes' Amen! - Amen! Right here, shall stand a memorial to Baba Makhdoom and from afar.. Men of all religions and creed will travel here seeking solace Waaris Shah, this is my legacy. Go forth to Malkahans.. And live there, amongst the people, while you write the ballad, 'Heer And until you have completed your task, live there.. For there still are those who cherish music 'We are like kites, soaring in skies.." 'We are like kites, soaring in skies.." 'We are like kites, soaring in skies.." 'Until in a tie of strings, are torn our ties, suddenly' 'What, o'what gain is there in renting us apart ?* 'what gain is there in renting us apart ?* 'Like kites we are, in skies' 'We are like kites, soaring in skies.." 'We are like kites, soaring in skies.." 'Oh how we wish we could soar in open skies,' 'Oh how we wish we could soar in open skies,' 'where the blue is vast and cool blows the breeze, | wish to bathe in clouds' 'Then suddenly tempests strike, sorrow envelops my life' 'Then suddenly tempests strike, sorrow envelops my life' 'My heart trembles, what o 'what gain is there in renting us apart ?" 'What gain is there in renting us apart ?* 'Like kites we are, in skies, 'We are like kites, soaring in skies.." 'We are like kites, soaring in skies.." 'Rising from earth, to roam the skies" 'rising from earth, to roam the skies" 'Then suddenly mishap strikes, strife envelops my life' 'Then suddenly mishap strikes, strife envelops my life' 'Hand in hand, I want to walk, till the very end" 'Hand in hand, I want to walk, till the very end" I shall never doubt you, my friend" 'What, o 'what gain is there in renting us apart ?* 'what gain is there in renting us apart ?* 'Like kites we are, in skies' 'We are like kites, soaring in skies.." 'We are like kites, soaring in skies.." Pardon me, may I know how leads the road to Malkahans ? Oh rosy lips, that hide the redden tongue, perched upon the perfectly shaped face Teeth like jasmine buds, your smile betrays pearls Beauty, blossoming like the fruit in the middle of deserts Rano, ask this stranger, does he flatter your beauty or mine ? Rano-ji, I am Waaris Shah | obey my master's command to travel to Malkahans, to write my 'Heer" Rano ask him, is his Heer more beautiful than I am ? Rano, remind her, she is God's creation 'Heer' is to be my humble creation How can they compare ? Rano-ji.. You still haven't told me what way to Malkahans Rano, but this stranger stands right in Malkahans Ask him, where he has to go ? Choudhary-saheb's house There ! And he's telling that to Choudhary-saheb's daughter Rano, it's our duty to help the traveler You get along, I'll show him the way Come In that case, you will be a guest in my house The mosque compound is the right place to write 'Heer' Whatever you prefer As you wish. Bhagpari.. Yes ? You will take food to him, twice a day Father, ask him whether he'd prefer to eat what I cook Well.. let me ask Rano Rano...? Didn't you say, you're single ? Is Rano.. I mean, are you married...? Rano, my goat On arrival, he made friends with her May Allah so deign, that you bring to eternal fame this place I live right across, if you need anything, do not hesitate I am obliged, Imam-saheb May God be with you - God be with you Do you realize, whom you have given shelter ? An infidel This town will come to ruin. Drive that Satan out of this town Qazi-saheb, is this your writ, or your personal opinion ? Malik-saheb I am.. In the name of the merciful Lord I begin, thankfully,* 'for out of love, He created this Universe' 'He is the first One who loved' "And His prophet was in love with Him' Brilliant Qazi, do you call this lover of Allah's prophet an infidel ? Maybe the spies gave me wrong news.. but it's a song he sings, no ? Qazi, even the Muezzin's call to prayer is rendered like a song Music abounds in The Lord's creation, in the chirping of birds, ...the cuckoo's song You'll imprison them all ? "When Heer brings the delicacies for her lover Ranjha, 'with her hands,* 'when lovingly she feeds the bread dipped in butter,' "With the love, she cares for him,* 'not missing the smallest emotion...! 'Every emotion there is to Waaris Shah..* 'she peels, reveals, layer by layer' Who are you ? What are you doing here, at this time ? What I am.. is lost in the magic of what you sing Tell me when you remember Also tell me, who I am Oh !I remember ! I am Bhagpari And you, Waaris Shah | came with supper, for you - Put it down I'll eat, when I'm hungry Are you asking me to leave ? How can a beggar ask you to leave ? Yes, you may ask me to leave Abida, Nasreen, come ! Noora.. we girls should go to the mosque A magician has come to town, in a melody and passionate poetry, he talks about love. Quick! Let's go 'Amongst her many friends who come with her," 'her enchanting beauty makes her vain' 'Oh, the flashing vine-like pearls in her ears' "Who gives he this grace of angels ?* Saabo...? O'Saabo.. what for have you come here ? Bhagpari, the waters, the winds, the Sun and Moon and lores of love.. To all nature, all have equal claim And it's been my habit from childhood to do as I wish, to take what I wish Well Waaris-ji, what do you say ? If you ask that of a fakir what I am given, is my destiny All else, is an unattainable illusion in eyes When the light goes out.. and who in world, knows when ? Waaris Shah is the dispossessed, a fakir All strings are held in His hands.. what Bhagpari ? You speak deep thoughts I shall leave 'Let never mysteries of love be unraveled' 'Let no one bespeak these mysteries' 'True is the lover, who bares not his pain' 'and suffers in silence' O'poet.. even I can play that pipe This pipe is called a flute Music is not in the flute, but in the person.. Who breathes music into it. - Then, I'm bursting with music Wait, hold Rano Pass me the pipe And hear me out In here...? Poet, why does the music inside me not pour out ? The rapport between that music and the flute must be established How so ? Like so When it touches your lips, it sounds so sweet, why ? When it passed to me from your lips I felt it sweet too Why ? The mysteries of nature are revealed slowly Slowly then, it must teach me so much May I keep it ? Yes What cost ? If you learn to play it it's priceless. Else, worthless | see I shall leave Come Rano 'Secretly, Waaris Shah, we must nurture our.. ...emotions from worldly people' Who...? Bhagpari.. at this odd hour ? I wondered what to give in exchange for the pipe Take.. my most precious possession A dove ? This naughty thing is called 'Tattler' Every mischief of yours.. He will carry to me Now, the next lesson about the flute ? Of course Blow into the hole, all your breath I shall leave Poet, rein the Tattler in. At every chance, he flies to me I'm writing Heer's tale, might he be writing mine ? Can my name too figure in the Tattler's tale ? Now stop writing and eat Your wish is my command "O'dove, my courier...! "O'dove, my courier...! 'For God's sake.." 'For God's sake.." 'You are the bird who binds lovers together,' 'o'courier of passions may you be forever' 'o'courier of passions may you be forever' "O'dove, my courier...! 'For God's sake.." 'For God's sake.."

Patience, he will make our town famous He's leading the young boys and girls astray He's singing, violating the king's law and he is inciting the people I will have to complain to the governor about him Qazi, forget the boys and girls. You don't get carried away A quack is a threat to life A priest of infirm convictions is a threat to the creed Qazi Gyasuddin, if your accusations are proven true, Waaris Shah maybe hanged. - My Lord, just order his arrest He will confess Waaris is to be arrested and presented before me Forgive my trespasses, my Lord Choudhary, Malik, all the boys, girls, they're all his fans A chance of rebellion The arrest may be made by night Waaris Shah...? Yes ? By the governor's orders, on charges of blasphemy, you are arrested Bring him along Waaris Shah, what have you to say in your defence ? All accusations are false In the music of minstrels one transcends to God, a way to reach Him It brings one face to face with the Divine The fiery manifestation of which was witnessed by Moses upon Mount Sinai Music can show the same miracle. The fire which burns no one, only lights an ecstasy If you can't perform this miracle, do you know what will befall you ? Forgive me, Lord What's to befall upon you and I were decided the day when we were born The rest I leave to Allah Do not play with words. Just say, can you perform the miracle ? A shrine to Baba Makhdoom stands in Kasoor I shall perform the miracle in the presence of my mentor 'Allah-hu.. 'Allah-hu.. 'Allah-hu, sing my strings' 'Allah-hu, sing my strings' 'Allah-hu, sing my strings' 'Allah-hu, sing my strings' 'Lovers pray in every breath, you prescribe only five times ?* 'All Bulle Shah possesses is a single rosary' 'All he chants is Allah's name' 'Allah-hu, sing my strings' 'Allah-hu, sing my strings' 'Allah-hu, sing my strings' 'Allah-hu, sing my strings' 'Allah-hu..

You are truly Allah's devotee | have said my prayers, | observed every ritual But the light which now rises from within.. I never felt before Waaris Shah, may your name and the name of your Heer live forever So I pray Come Poet.. Say.. You will have Heer and Ranjha unite, won't you ? The storyteller brings to life the players in his tale.. And he becomes their minion and what consequences they reach, are no more the storyteller's dictate But circumstance, which they find themselves in, will decide Then why do I feel as if I know so intimately, your Heer and Ranjha ? Baba Makhdoom said, some experiences are universal, some personal Yours ? Personal You know Heer and Ranjha ? As closely as I know myself .. and you But you do not know the culmination, neither yours nor mine Baba Makhdoom knows 'Seething in anger she charged, arm upraised to strike' 'that beauteous visage, torments the man' 'Ranjha wakes out of a dream, What a wonder, my love' 'Heer rewards with a smile,” 'It's her Ranjha, who carries the flute, his earrings shine' 'Behind the locks flowing on her face, she blushes' 'Between beauty and amour, it was love at first sight' 'Heer is overwhelmed, shy' Saabo, come to your senses. Have you gone mad ? I'm crazen in your love This is no love, but lust What you blame to be lust is God's truth In the union of man and woman creation is propagated Saabo, do not lay waste your youth. Marry a man your parents choose And bear out God's truth Waaris, do not spurn me lest | turn into a venomous serpent The charmer fears no snake That, only time will tell Praise be to Allah, The Merciful and most Benevolent Heer...? Father, lassi (lassi: yogurt drink) No, daughter. What a morning, | haven't heard Waaris Shah's voice It's as if the Sun has not risen God bless, I hope he is in good health I'll find out...? No child, I shall go You keep up with your mother and the chores, you'll marry soon This town is as cold as a graveyard without Waaris Shah's voice We'll soon be called the Silent City. A breaking of hearts makes no sound Can you guess what next is to happen to Heer and Ranjha ? Don't ask me, go and ask Waaris. - But today, he has been silent All day, he hasn't sung a verse Waaris, how can this be possible ? We have taken you as one of our own Flowers are known by their thorns My manuscript is gone, my art is lost I wish, I died Your life is God's gift. Only He gives, only He takes. By any creed.. Suicide is sin, to be punished in Hell What worse a Hell can there be, my Heer is gone God willing, you may still find it If the mint from which the coins were stolen, still stands.. Why grieve ? The kingdom of the heart lies ruined - But what's come over Waaris ? Waaris knows, or God knows. - His Heer manuscript is stolen So much of effort gone to waste, the poor thing is morose If you want the manuscript of Heer, come at midnight to the old castle Give me my desire, I'll give you yours too 'I'm set afire in my passion for you' 'This fire I've lit only for you' 'I'm set afire in my passion for you' 'This fire I've lit only for you' 'Stoke the embers or douse my fire.. 'Stoke the embers or douse my fire, 1 give into your wish, tonight' 'But only for you, my fires I lit' 'But only for you, my fires I lit' "You are proud and vain for your beauty' 'Only girlish mischief and conceit are upon your mind' 'Lovers, fakirs, cobras, bees,..

Enough of niceties-courtesies, Waaris Now, we transact ? Saabo, love's portent is lost when you begin transacting Look Waaris, you want the Heer manuscript and I want you If I am not to have you, then the fires that consume me will also destroy Heer Is that fair exchange ? Saabo, if you ask me to pick between honor and heart.. Then my answer is honor Very well then, Waaris I'll put to fire your heart Waaris, do not break our hearts, do not leave Remember what you swore to your Master If you lose courage and leave this town, then who will write Heer ? Do not leave, Waaris Poet, your Master's command, here you must bring Heer to life Here lies the story so far Some you sent to me through the Tattler dove ; the rest I heard in your own words, | committed to memory Take.. your tale Anything else you wish ? AsSalamu Alaykum, Aunt. - WaAlaykum AsSalaam, my boy AsSalamu Alaykum, Ashraf Miyan. - WaAlaykum AsSalaam, Inayat Miyan Chaudhary saheb, AsSalamu Alaykum. WaAlaykum AsSalaam. - Inayat, welcome Where have you been ? - Kabul, Balkh and Bukhara Will you be in town for a while ? - He must be raring to leave What can I do, I'm footloose Then we'll hatch a plan to tie you down Leave him be, let him go home. His folks must be expecting him Yes, I'll be on my way. - God be with you Saabo, Abba, Ammi.. I'm home {(Abba: Father ; Ammi: Mother) Good boy! Halt! Abba...! - Inayat my boy.. AsSalamu Alaykum, Abba. - WaAlaykum AsSalaam Brother! Saabo, what news of you ? You're home, son ? - AsSalamu Alaykum Live long, son I missed all of you. - We were counting days, son How feeble my son looks. - Not at all What have you brought for me ? - Mother and sister, stop pestering Fetch him water to drink. Go. -You take out what you have for me So many things, sister 'Every logic I shall accept, 'but no one can erase this thing ever' 'Being in love is such a disease, 'heads may roll, but love'll cease, never' This is for me ? - It's for Bhagpari This is for me! - It's also for Bhagpari Is this for me ? - For Bhagpari, but you can keep it Everyone I find, has Bhagpari on his mind Enough of running off to Balkh and Bukhara Now stay at home, marry Bhagpari and tend the farmland I'm going over to fix the wedding date Bhagpari is yours, how long can I keep her in my care Each year, you keep putting off the wedding date It's why I'm here. It's the only way | can stop Inayat from running off It's time to get him married to Bhagpari Every silken dress, the sight of jewelry in gold and silver, always makes me wonder.. How pretty my Bhagpari will look in it ? 'In testing times, to sacrifice love' 'In pining for a lost love, is true love too' 'If truth be told, now speak it true' 'Now is the time to belie falsehood' A lover drowned herself in ariver.." 'When love's pangs were too much to bear' 'Q'Waaris Shah, if it must be suicide. 'Then come, fall in love' Who is Waaris Shah, how long has he been having an affair with Bhagpari? It's none of the sort, son. He's a poet He came to town to write poetry He has melody, boy and girls flock to him to hear his verse Our Saabo goes too, yes Saabo ? -Yes Abba Don't worry I'll visit Bhagpari's house, to put a stop to it all But the dove ? - There's a cure for it too Have no worries. Prepare for the wedding Very good. God keep you. - God keep you Whose messages does the dove bring ? - Only verses of 'Heer' from Waaris Stop this exchange of letters with strangers Waaris is no stranger to us. - Don't talk rubbish You are about to wed Inayat. - My wedding ? Without my consent ? Never was a girl's consent asked, you take for a husband the man of your parents' choice Consent is a man's right. It's tradition, it's law Can I not be married to Waaris ? I love him Silence ! Never again bring such words to mouth.. ...it'll be the ruination of you and him Till the day you wed, you'll stay indoors Bhagpari You are about to marry, stop coming here Can all do as bidden ? If they wish, they can Can you speak a lie ? No Can you elope with me ? Bhagpari You can't ? You can't, can you ? Then ask not of flower not to be fragrant Beg not of thorns, not to prick. I will do what's in my powers What is beyond me, I am bounden to 'Heer, love's ecstasy cannot be savored..' 'if it's adulterated with what's stolen or lustful' "O'Waaris Shah, the goldsmith knows.." 'How priceless gold is corrupted' Waaris, open your eyes. It's me, Saabo Saabo, what have you left to burn ? Much The Tattler will tattle no more, nor Bhagpari fetches you your bread She is to wed.. my brother Now I shall be coming Have you more arrows in your quiver? Yes Then poison my bread A dead Waaris, is what use to me ? I want this Waaris, alive Supper 'Fires of love, so hard to suffer' 'Love, the greatest tutor, tempers every other emotion' 'Waaris Shah the fakir, who renounces all else, ...0'let his prayers bear fruit' 'In culmination, let Heer's love be requited' Bhagpari, your fiance accuses that you and Waaris are in love. Is it true ? True Waaris Shah What have you to say ? It is true So you both confess your crime ? What crime is done ? Love captivates the world of Creation the earth and heavens, Qazi Love is the root, the seed of creation Will you refute God's commandment ? It's unbecoming of the Wise, to speak falsehoods while reciting scriptures Teach me not these philosophies If it's no physical relationship, are the two of you willing.. To face the test of chastity ? Yes You shall walk upon burning coals If a single blister is suffered, you will be punished with death 'When you have made pure your Soul, then witness love's test' 'When you have made pure your Soul, then witness love's test' 'When you have made pure your Soul, then witness love's test' 'In zealous sacrifice, set yourself afire, then witness' 'When you have made pure your Soul, then witness love's test' 'When you have made pure your Soul, then witness love's test' 'Witness in romances, this culmination of love' 'Witness in romances, this culmination of love' 'One who is ruined, is given.

Which you shall pay to Waaris Waaris, this miracle is proof, that you are in love with Allah And Allah loves you Take, the price for your victory and my loss Imam saheb, what use are gold coins to me ? Use it for the mosque Imam saheb, I wish to speak with Waaris in private Waaris Shah.. What do you think.. you have won ? You are lost You have lost Your victory betrays your defeat, my loss is my gain A beautiful death, that only one in a million lovers are destined to court.. Could have been yours, had you only suffered the blisters Wretched you live, so wretched you shall die Bhagpari was destined to be mine The vows were made long ago She will wed me Even the date is fixed | only came to invite you Inayat, if I tell you that you do not hurt me, it'd be a lie I'm no angel I am human This day on, I shall not remain the Waaris I was Maybe it's this day, that my Master told me about.. The pain will enrich my pen What is mine to seek ? To reap the riches of pathos or Bhagpari ? Futile is the seeking of the path when the guiding hand is no more But I'll take what God gives What you deserve is not in God's hands, but in mine But, even I am no angel Waaris, what's come over you ? Why are you speaking of renunciation ? At this time so many desires must be blossoming in your heart Do not ask me what's happened In the drawing of each breath I feel the incision of a double-edged sword I know In the emptinesses of your heart a pathos has awakened Was it the riches of such a pathos that Baba Makhdoom alluded to ? He had said, what I lack is passion Waaris, only on one condition, | shall accept you as my disciple The riches of all pathos you reap, you shall spend in writing Heer And until Heer is completed, you shall live in Malkahans Bhagpari, daughter of Ishfaqullah Chaudhary.. Your wedding is to be solemnized with Inayat, son of Rashid Malik Do you give consent ? I ask a second time, do you concede to marriage with Inayat Malik ? For the last time, do you concede to marriage with Inayat Malik ? Bhagpari.. Bhagpari...! -Oh? The bride has conceded Congratulations.. - Happy tidings Congratulations Chaudhary saheb 'Without sacrifice, this love can never blossom' 'The pathways of love are not easy' 'Until doomsday, won't heal the wounds.! 'Those inflicted by love's knives' Waaris Shah, Bhagpari is now estranged to you. Now forget her She was always a stranger, only my memories of her were mine, they still remain Let go of your memories, in dreams of me And forget the one for whose sake I have renounced all ? 'Heer says, O'Ranjha woe betide' 'l have no shame left' 'l have renounced all I had' 'Yet you have no mercy for me ?* 'Like the wailing bird I cry all day, night' 'l am struck by a dementia' "O'Waaris, have I no sympathizer left' 'O'whom am I to tell my woes ?* That's all for today. Go home, everyone Saabo, you too. It's time to start the kitchen fires You know when I cook, when I eat, you know not of my heart ? That I know, too I have earned your ire Still you do not look upon me, even as a foe ? You are no foe of mine, no one is, not even Qazi I have heard, in one's heart, there's place for only two, friend and foe Even in hatred is a kind of loving, a sort of kinship, no ? Even this kinship of hatred is not mine ? Stab a sword into water, but water is not severed, Saabo Where do they go, who find neither love nor hatred ? Estranged once, I am to remain a stranger forever ? Ones who set their hearts, attain God before sinners like me attain God before He calls us Easier said than done Where are you coming from ? Where I go every day To Waaris Shah ? Why ask when you know ? You and I are married. It's your duty to obey your husband's command Never again, shall you go to see him Except about Allah, His Prophet and Waaris Shah, every command of yours, I shall obey You own me, body and life If you wish, you may have my life Your body, yes. But it's one else who owns your heart Such is true, but who has a hold on the heart ? Do you have a hold upon your heart? Your body is mine and your heart is with someone else ? This sharing, I do not accept At wish, you may divorce me I want to possess you, heart and soul. And you want freedom from me? Remember this Bhagpari, if you won't give in to me body and soul, then you will not belong to anyone else Saabo, what happened to you ? Noora, my heart won't relent, nor my heart's love It's as if my hunger, my thirst, is there no more All the while I feel as if a fire is consuming my body Strange malaise, you should see the apothecary No doctor has any cure for this disease that's love Waaris Shah surely has. He knows love's every mystery You tell me to ask a cure of the man who inflicted this ill ? Is that the story ? Then go to Baba Makhdoom's shrine and pray Your purpose will be served O'Makhdoom Baba, Giver of the wishes of many.. Grant me my wish too If you won't grant me my wish, how will I know how great you are Give to me Waaris Without Waaris, what use is this life ? The sin of my death be upon you Give me Waaris Saabo.. Saabo.. Look, I have brought for you Henna, the bride's wedding colors Makhdoom Baba sends it For me 7? What you have brought for me, paint me with your own hands Recite for me, some new verse from 'Heer' Saabo, after this day, Waaris will never sing a verse You wished for me, I have come, to become yours But your share of me, will only be a mortal form What do you mean ? My Master's dream will go unrealized Heer will never be completed What.. I may have you, but never completely ? | am to remain incomplete ...so also my Waaris ? No, not this Waaris I desired. Once tied to me, his Heer is abandoned? Then what do I say to Baba Makhdoom ? Say.. Saabo has set you free Now you have more memories to add to Heer The sacrifice of a million Saabos your verses deserve But I was trying to catch a shadow, what a fool I was Inayat, the thorn that pricks you, is the same that's pricking me I have lost once. Chaudhary and Malik are his fans Even the governor became his fan. And this son of mine feeds himself fat No hopes that he might ever lessen his father's burden Throwing him out of this town is impossible But throwing him out of the world is possible Can you go to that extent ? - Anything, for the fires I burn in Qazi saheb, in your court.. ...we have been convicted and punished several times Sinners that we are, what makes you call upon us ? Turn of circumstance Speak openly please. - Waaris Shah, you know him? Yes, a traveler I hear. He lives in the mosque, writing Heer He has to be killed and his body, disposed of This case won't come up for hearing in your court ? In no court Quick It all went well ? Your bidding is done, Qazi saheb. -No one saw ? You left behind no evidence ? -We're old hands and you know it Bhagpari.. The laddoo is your favorite, is it not 2?2? What gives, you seem elated ? Yes.. listen.. Do you see red in my hands ? No Never mind, tomorrow or day after, you'll know the secret of my joys Eat a laddoo AsSalaamu Alaykum. - WaAlaykum AsSalaam Malik saheb, no sound of Waaris ? - Even I've been wondering.. 'All noble deeds are God's own' 'l the doer, seek no credit' "Waaris Shah of Jandiala.." 'Became a disciple.." 'Of Makhdoom of Kasoor' AsSalaamu Alaykum. - WaAlaykum AsSalaam Sirs, so early in the morning ? You could have asked for me This morning we didn't hear any verse from Heer, so we worried.. And we thought, let's take a look, is everything all right ? Last night, my Master visited me. And how time flew, in his company Waaris.. Waaris.. Master.. it's you ! How far has Heer progressed ? - You know better Come out in the open, | wish to speak with you Come 'As one sows so shall he reap' 'On judgment day, all scores are settled' 'For all gives and takes, reward and retribution' 'There, Justice is handed out to you' 'No one lives here forever' 'Only one who.. ...has lovingly renounced will live forever' 'You'll know it for yourselves...! 'Come judgment day' Bhagpari.. The completion of Heer is a matter of joy Also a sorrow for separating from a dear friend These are your memories and mine My gift to you Poet, Heer belonged to and.. .Will always belong to Waaris Shah for all time Are those whom you leave behind ever to hope of seeing you again ? Saabo, as if I'm astride a willful horse, it's reins aren't in my hands, my feet flailing, outside stirrups Not only mine, it's the destiny of all ; taking us where we are destined to be Whether it'll bring me back here, I do not know All I know is, returning isn't in my hands The monk's lot is to travel, let others build cities What are you staring at ? Your smile Even that's not for me This aloofness, I cannot bear anymore Bhagpari The fires that burn me will be quenched.. Only in my death Or yours Say, should I drink this poison ? Or you ? I am the root cause of all this strife My death is desirable You won't let me live, you won't even let me die ? Tell me, what do I do ? And what doldo ? No!
