I thought you wanted to quit. It’s menthol. Really? Okay, you’re right. Do you have gum? Nope. Hold on, I’ve got some. Seriously? They‘re the best! Dora, are there train tracks ahead? What train tracks? Well, according to this map we have to turn left after the train tracks, then there is a lake, we turn right at the castle, and then we should basically be - - Let me have a look, Lukas. So, we have to turn right up ahead and then go straight. Then we’re there. Amateur. You’re an amateur. Damn! WANDA: Great job. Now no one can read it. It’s not how I remember it. - It’s pretty run down since grandpa moved to the city. Hmm, true. Why haven’t we come here sooner? Damn it. Hey dude, you have the key? Dora? You have the key, right? Feels great to get away for a while. Get a room. - Idiot. Where do you know Anton from? - University. Ah, so you’re studying? Yeah, sports. Sports, that’s what I thought. How long have you known each other? No idea, two years? So it’s been a while. Do you hang out a lot? Here. My ID, Nancy Drew. I don’t understand. That’s how an interrogation works, right? Careful. Dude. Yeah, time has stopped a little around here. A little? Do you want a drink? Sure. So, should we head to the lake? Let’s unpack first. And Lukas - - Hey! Are you crazy? Woah, that was close. Can anyone tell me what time it is? Sure, it’s half past fi - - Ooh! Seriously? It’s just lemoade, I - - No, don’t. Everything alright? Yeah, I’m changing. That’s really wet. Relax. I’m going to bed. Sleep well. OK then, good night. Good night! Sweet dreams! Night. Aren’t you tired? No, I’ll join you later. Okay. Have you done this before? Is there a trick? Damn. ANTON: Wanda is pretty nice actually. LUKAS: Uh huh. But when new people are around she can be a bit annoying. Are you alright? - Uh huh. Dora wants to move in together. No, my stick- Hmm. Anton? Are you awake? Good morning. I thought you were still asleep. Yes. Sorry. Don't, Dora. What’s up? Good morning, beautiful people! Good morning. Did you sleep well? Yup. Good morning. Morning. Music? How about a swim after breakfast? So? What else do you do? Any interesting hobbies? Come on, tell me. Why didn’t we take the car? Anyone want to play with the beach ball? Sure, why not? Want to swim to the other side? Sure. Hey, what about the beach ball now? Everything alright? - Yeah. What? Dora. Dora! So, who are you looking for Anton? You’re annoying. Anton! Can you help me with the dishes, please? Yeah. In a minute! Today! - Are you crazy? And what’s up with Lukas? What’s your fucking problem Dora? DORA: What is my problem? I want to know what your problem is. Lukas, maybe it’s time to admit that you’re into Anton. You can’t be serious. Is that why you were - ANTON: What? That’s why I was like what? ANTON: Dora. Dora! I'm sorry. Me too. Lukas, I'm sorry. I don’t know what - - Anton. It's alright. Gum anybody? I thought you wanted to quit? It’s menthol. - Really? Okay, you’re right. Do you have gum? Nope. Hold on, I’ve got some. No, damn it. Dora, are there train tracks ahead? What train tracks? Well, according to this map we have to turn left after the train tracks, then there is lake, we turn right after the castle- Show me that, Lukas. - No, I got this. I have to know if I need to turn left or not. Yes! - No! Dude. What a dump. Well, Sir? Do you need help? Boo! - Oh man, Dora! You silly cow. I just remembered grandpa‘s old story. Right! The legend he always talked about. A silver necklace - BOTH: - with a red jewel. Ah, here it is. Girls, we can go! I know the way now. It’s not how I remember it. - It’s pretty run down, ever since grandpa moved to the city. Hmm, true. Why haven’t we come here sooner? Dude, you have the key? Do you want a drink? - Sure. So, should we head to the lake? Let’s unpack first. Well, Lukas? With - Hey, are you crazy? - That was close. Are you guys alright? - No. Wanda almost ruined my clothes. - But I didn't. Anton? Looks like the necklace from the legend, don’t you think? How crazy it would be, if the legend was true. What legend? About the silver necklace in the woods behind the castle. So you’re calling that pile of rubble a castle. Tell the story. According to grandpa, a man went into the woods many years ago to chop wood. And just as he was about to cut down the tree, he saw something shiny on the roots. A beautiful silver necklace with a big jewel. The man took it home and gave it to his wife. But then the forest took the necklace back. And brave adventurers still search for the lost necklace in the woods. Pretty scary. For a five-year-old. I see, Wanda. This weekend we’ll go on a treasure hunt. Did you see that? What? There was a light. Well, Wanda? Are you seeing ghosts? There was a light. DORA: Good morning, I thought you were still sleeping. ANTON: Yes. ANTON: Sorry. ANTON: Don't, Dora. DORA: What's up? Good morning, beautiful people! Sleep well? - Yep. Music? I’ve been thinking about the necklace. Morning. - Morning. Morning. Why is there a drawing of the necklace behind the picture in grandpa's house? Who knows. Maybe we’ll find more if we look around. Well then. I’d like that. And I already know where to begin. I wasn’t serious about that whole searching thing. Well done, Wanda. This, little cousin, is just the beginning. A diary. That's grandpa's. And? Anything interesting in it? Maybe something about a necklace? [November 17th, 1963] [My search begins during a thunderstorm] [a silver necklace with a red jewel] [July 23rd, 1964] [Sunburn, glowing shovel] [Searched the southern forest – no necklace!] [on the wrong trail] [February 17th, 1969] [For the sake of my wife-] [I shall end this treasure hunt] [May 1st, 1975] [It’s almost like the forest had me under a spell.] [Storm, rain, a swarm of mosquitos.] [August 7th, 1986] [Again, I feel the spirit of the legend.] [The answer must be close.] [on a photo expedition] [April 19th, 1992] [crates long forgotten] [Clues lead to nothing.] [March 21st, 1997] [Last try failed. I’m at a loss] So, girls? What have you found? Aw, come on. I’m dying of boredom here. Also, I’ve reached my maximum tan. Our grandparents also investigated the legend and are actually convinced that it’s true. That explains why the suitcase only has photos and notes about the legend in it. Nothing else? How are we supposed to find anything with that? We? Maybe we’ll find something else in the house. Come on, grandpa. Pick up the phone. Hey people! I think I‘ve found something. Who walks so late through night in wind and the woods, he has teeth“ “Squire von Ribbeck at Ribeck to Havelland when he met Nathan the Mysterious“ “Lift up your heads, ye mighty gate, You walked in the woods – and lead me there,“ „And find nothing – That was my treasure.“ Huh? And now? We have to think. - Thanks, I would have never considered that. - Shh! We might be very close. So let’s go through it line by line: “Who walks so late through night in wind and the woods, he has teeth-“ I got it. They are verses. Not bad, sir. Not bad. I think it was clear to everyone that they were verses. Except for Lukas, maybe. So again from the beginning: “Who walks so late through night in wind-“ It’s supposed to be: „Who rides". “Who rides so late through night and wind.” What now? - Well, you just have to know where to look. Or you simply know it. Lukas is right. I think there are wrong words in the other verses as well. [rides] [and] [shark] [in] [wise] [door] [I] [went] [so] [seeking] [meaning] DORA: "Riding and shark in wise door I went so seek meaning." DORA: Huh? I know where we have to go now. Really? - No! What’s this nonsense supposed to mean? ANTON: Nothing. Maybe we missed something. But we’ve looked everywhere. I think someone played a trick on us. I don’t want to do it anymore. - But... Sorry Wanda, but it was worth a shot. Let’s take a break for now. I’ll catch up with you later. WANDA: Go into the forest, to the mysterious gate- WANDA: You go and find the treasure. Guys, I’ve got it! The wrong words are the solution. I know where we have to go. Are you coming or what? Come on, Lukas! - Yes! WANDA: This has to be it. Okay. You have some explaining to do. How did you figure that out? The dragon. ANTON: Of course! Didn’t think you were capable of that, Wanda. Yes, yes. Congratulations. Well I’m not going to climb in that ruin. I’m not suicidal. Let’s just go to the gate first. Hey, Wanda. Look, we’ve found something. Go on, you open it. I wonder how much we can sell it for on ebay? Come on, it was fun, wasn’t it? Very funny. Someone really tricked us. WANDA: Oh man, be careful you idiot. LUKAS: Sorry. WANDA: What now? “My dearest Dora, my dearest Wanda, "I hope you had a great weekend. I’m sorry that I couldn’t be there" "to see your dissapointed faces when you found the treasure." "But don’t be mad, I went through the same thing years ago," "just like your mothers, my father and his brothers and sisters." "I’m proud, that you not only found the treasure but also this letter." "I hope you enjoyed it. See you soon, your grandpa.“ Your grandpa is nuts. I thought you wanted to quit. It's Menthol. Really? Yeah you're right. Do you have gum? Nope. Wait, I've got some. Shit. What the hell are you doing, Dora? I threw the cigarette against the window, and - And that’s why you have to kill us? Smoking is deadly, huh? Ha ha, very funny, Lukas. There was someone in the road. What? There was someone in the road. Didn't you see him? No. - Nope. No. There was someone in the road. Dora, are there train tracks ahead? What? Train tracks. I'm going to bed. Sleep well. Anton? Anton? Yes, I’m coming. Good night then. - Night. Good night. Sweet dreams. And, how is - - I think I’m going to sleep. What the hell? Who turned on the music? What is that? Turn it off! What’s with that noise? Why are you partying? It wasn’t us. - That thing turned itself on. Your thing turns itself on. I'm going to wake up Wanda. So? - So? Sleep well? - Mhm. And you? - Yeah. Wanda is gone. What do you mean "gone"? - Well, she's not there. Ah. She probably just went to the lake. She really wanted to go there yesterday. No, her bathing suit is still in her room and her bed wasn’t used. Have you checked the attic yet? Why would I do that? - Hey! Calm down. We have to go look for her. - Dora, calm down first. Where exactly do you want to look for her? Are you her cousin, or am I? Luckily, I’m not. - Exactly. I know Wanda. She would never just run off without saying anything or at least leaving a note. - Okay. At least try calling her first. [This is the Mailbox of the wonderful Wanda-] She doesn’t pick up. Can we please go look for her now? Dora. Where exactly do you want to look? You were with her last night around the campfire. Did she say anything? No, man. No idea. I went to bed right after you. Maybe she did go to the lake. Let’s look there. Sure. And last night she went to relax with a drink in a lounge chair. Do you have a better idea? Why didn’t we take the car? Wanda? Wanda! Come on. She's not here. She has to be here somewhere. Maybe we should just go home. Dora. I think he is right. Maybe she already went back home. I don’t think so. She would have called us already. We should keep looking. I’ll try calling her again. It's no use. I told you it’s no use. - It’s worth a try. At least we want to find Wanda. What’s that supposed to mean? - Come on, man, you don’t even want to find her. - Guys? I think you’re overreacting. - So, you call that overreacting? Guys, shut up! - What is it? Shh! Do you hear that? That’s coming from the forest. Come on, let’s go. Guys! Oh god! Okay, we have to call the police. And what do you want to tell them? “We’re somewhere in the forest“, or what? Yes. I don’t know, man. But we have to do something. Yeah, yeah. We have to wait 24 hours before we can report her missing. Bullshit, where did you get that from - I read it. You read it - Yes, I did! Guys. Whatever, I’m calling them now. Dude. Did you guys just see that shit? What was that? - No idea. Lukas! - It's no use. We have to go after him! - We can't. We can’t leave him alone also. - He left us alone. Are you serious? Yes, we have to go find Wanda. - And you don’t give a fuck about Lukas? No, but I- - Shut up! Anton. - You won’t tell me what to do anymore. I’m going to look for Lukas. You either come with me or you don’t. No? Alright. Anton! Anton. It‘s not real. It‘s not real. It‘s not real. It‘s not real. Anton. Anton. Do you have gum? - Nope. Hold on, I've got some. Shit.
