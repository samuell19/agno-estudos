[Atmospheric music] [Thunder clap] [Splitting wood] Inside... inside. Terms of the agreement? Williams warned me you'd be a slippery fucker. Where's the rest of it? Half now, half when the boat comes. That's not what we agreed. Those are my terms. Camp down on the beach. These marshes are ours. The boat will be coming in the beginning of the month. I'll come to collect the rest when it arrives. Williams said it would be days. Did he? You're fuckin' lucky it's coming at all. 'Course if you'd rather stay I mean. No. Didn't think so. You stay away from us, do you hear? If the Queen's justices come looking, you get no protection from us... understood? Fuck off. God go with you. [Unnerving music] [Crackling fire] What is it? You should have told me. Liz, I'm doing this for you. For us. So we get a place of our own, a place away from all this. No more tents. No more tents? Four walls? - Four Walls. A roof? - And a baby in your belly. At the end of the month, when the boats arrive we'll have enough money to get away from here. Hasn't happened yet- - Our time will come. The good Lord will look favourably upon us. He will listen and he will bless us. I promise. What about Patience? I promised to look after you. Patience too. [Sad music] [The sound of love making] [Thunder erupts as dawn breaks] [A crow caws] Come on. Breakfast's ready. [The wind blows] [Unnerving music] Jacob! Fucking listen to me. Why won't you stand up to him? Look at him. What hold has he got over you? I left- - TILD! We left everything for you. For this!? You call yourself a man? You're a coward. Go on. Go on. Go on! Show me what I'm good for. Go on... go on. I won't warn you again. You're pathetic. Pathetic! [David laughs] You need to keep her on a tighter leash Jacob. Wouldn't let any woman of mine talk to me like that. You need to take another wife. One that does what she's fucking told. [Laughs] What about Ben? He doesn't mind sharing, does he Kat? I'd have something to say about it. I don't doubt it. Still though, a man has ways to stop a sow's mouth. And a sow's got teeth to bite it off. [Laughs] She's not lying. You like a shriveled purse don't you Ben? Someone should I suppose? What about Patience? What do you think Patience? Could you satisfy Jacob? She might be a cursed wort but I bet she knows where to fucking put it, eh? Nothing to say for yourself Patience? I think we have an agreement then Jacob. - David! So eager. Not a word of complaint. See most ladies they like to play disinterest, but not Patience. No no no. She would happily cream the milk of another woman's husband. You're a bad girl Patience, but then again you already know that don't you? See the problem remains. Whilst a man loves a woman who can hold her own tongue. Every once in awhile, he likes a bit of conversation. A little praise whilst in the rough. That's enough David. You have to admit she's not much of a talker, but I bet she moans like a fucking bitch in heat. Oh, here we go. Ssssshhhhh...[She stutters/stammers] No we got that bit. [He imatates her stutter/stammer] Go on Patience, you can do it. [He laughs] I was only having a bit of jest Patience! Having a bit of fun. [Wind blows harshly] Ssssshhhhhhhhhh...[Stutters/sta Shut[Stutters/stammers] Shut... Shut... Shut... [Stutters/stammers] The...[Stutters/stammers attempting to sing] Tttttt... there... wwww... were [Trying to catch her breath] There were three... Ravens Sat on a tree. Down a down, hay down, a down They were black as black might be With a down Then one of them said to his mate Where shall we our breakfast take? With a down, derrie, derrie, derrie, down, down. Please don't stop. Sorry, I- I didn't mean to scare. No, no, no, here, look, here. Like this. [Gentle music] Here, look... ..like this.. It's not finished yet. Nearly... take... Rumi. Hello. What is your name? I am pleased to meet you. Good day to you. [Waves crash inn] [Someone sobbing] Haven't I worked hard, Patience? Prayed hard. God knows I've wanted hard enough. I thought I was late with my courses. But my bleed came today. I think I must be cursed. Maybe it's this place. Maybe we're all cursed. No. The girl can't go hungry. - You work, you eat. That's what we agreed when we started this. She don't eat today, she'll work harder tomorrow. No. [He chews loudly] [Wind whistles] [Sighs] R... Ru... Ruu...[Stutters/stammers] mi Ruu... mi You mustn't starve. No matter what he says. [Someone is urinating] [Heavy breathing] Patience, Patience, Patience... I've tried with you. Haven't I tried? Huh? Welcomed you in, taken you on. You know most men. They wouldn't have put up with you Patience. But not me. I was only having a bit of fun today. Don't you like fun? Girl like you ought to like a bit of fun. It's the most you can hope for. You shouldn't have run away today, Patience. How can I protect you if I don't know where you are? If you won't do what I say, how can I protect you? I want to help you, Patience. Why won't you let me help you? I want us to be a family, you know, like a proper family You. Me. Liz. Would you like that? I'm going to go now. I just want you to think on it. You're a good girl. [Sorrowful music] Good girl. [Lighter Music] [Laughter] [They laugh] Down in yonder green field. [Sings] Down a down, hay down, a down There lies a Knight slain under his shield, with a down... His hounds they lie down at his feet So well they can their Master keep. With a down, derrie, derrie, derrie, down, down. She buried him before the prime. Down a down, hay down, hay down She was dead herself there in some time with a down. God send every gentleman. Such hawks, such hounds and such women. With a down, derrie, derrie, derrie, down, down. [Thunder clap] [He breathes heavily] Let me show you. Knife. In. Up. [Ripping Flesh] Quick as a bird. Huh? It's easy. [She breathes heavily] [Light romantic music] [Bucket placed on the ground] [Lonely music] [Heavy Breathing] [Thunder rumbles] [Ave Maria - sung by choir] [Humming] [Sings] When I past dance, and sing and dance. [Humming] [Sudden music] [Whimpering] Let her go! Let her go. [Smack] [Smack] [Gasps] [Smack..smack..smack] Stay away from her. You stay away from her. You fucking stay away from her, or I'll fucking kill you. Do you hear me? I'll cut your fucking throat. I'll cut your fucking throat. Fucking pikey. [Gasping] [Whimpering] Come on you. You fucking cunt, you. Come on. [Thud] [Slap] G-g-g-Come on! What are you saying, Patience? Spit it out for once in your fucking life. What is this? This? This is a whore. A little whore who thought she was too good for my word. - David! She was with the Gyptian boy. The Gyptian boy. Weren't you Patience? Huh? Spreading her legs for him. Or you would have been, had I not found you in time. The question is, Patience. What... What do we do to a law breaking whore? - It's not her fault! He bewitched her. - He bewitched her! What do you think, Patience? Huh? Did he cast a spell on you? Did he? Go on, you can tell me. You can tell me. Did he cast a spell on you? Or did you like it? Did you want it? You fucking wanted it didn't you? Yes, you fucking did. You wanted him between your legs. You're as wet as the fucking marsh for that boy. You allowed yourself to be used by a leather-faced incubus. Huh? A demon, sent by the devil to spread more of his wicked kind. To spread his seed in her cunt. What's this? What's this? The devil's idol. The devil's idol! A devil's mark. Witch! Yes. YES. Yes, Beth. Witch. Yes. And you know what we do to witches? Do you? Of course not. You're so innocent. We burn the devil out of them. We burn the devil out of them! David, no! Please, no! DAVID! Fucking... whore. [Crying] Sssshhhh Defy me again. And I will burn the... fffffff... fucking witch out of you! [Spits] There's your devil's fucking idol. [Fire pops and crackles] Almighty and most merciful father. We have erred and strayed from thy ways like lost sheep. We have followed too much the devices and desires of our own hearts... [Ominous music ] [Voices distorted and can't be heard] [Thunder rumbles] Back before nightfall. [The cart wheels squeaks and rumble] Patience. Jacob, Take this. Not talking to me, Patience? Huh? [Sighs] Come on, Patience. Come on. I don't want any bad blood between us. One day you're going to thank me for stopping that night-skinned runt from getting into your cunt. Don't do anything silly, Patience. Don't do anything silly when I'm gone, because I'll know. You know that, don't you? You know if I found out you did anything silly, I wouldn't be happy. And I don't think- I don't think you like me when I'm not happy, do you? Do you, Patience? Help your sister while I'm away. You're a good girl, Patience. Such a good girl. Jacob. Come on. We'll be back by nightfall. [The cart wheels squeak and rumble] Patience Arif. You should not be here. Go. Back, where you belong. Back to your people. Arif. [Speaks in native language] Hello. I am glad you have come. [Sounds of the sea and wildlife at night] [The fire crackling] [Speaks in her native language] [Music -light/romantic] [Kissing] [Panting] [Kissing and panting] David couldn't get a price at market, but there might be somewhere that will take it. It's a day's journey away. Where the FUCK have you been? Take the food from your sister. She's coming with us. I thought you wanted me to come? I need you to look after the place while I'm gone, I need you to look after it. You're the only one that I trust. Hey, I need you to do that for me, will you? Please? Go on. Go on. - That's got everything on it? - Yeah. Yeah. Good. [Music - ominous] [The cart wheels squeak and rumble] PATIENCE. Come on. [The fire crackles] [Howling noises in the trees] There's demons in the trees out here. Spirits trapped in old tree stumps. They say that... howling and whistling- you hear? That's them. Screaming to get out. You don't have to be scared. Know, I won't let anything happen to you. Well this is fun and cozy, isn't it? Ah? What have I missed? I tell you what I'm missing Entertainment. Hey Patience? Look at me when I'm talking to you Patience. There's a good girl. So, as I was saying... ..the only thing missing... ..what do you say Patience? Girl like you, ought to be able to entertain a man. Hmm? Oh come on, don't be shy. It's not as though I haven't seen it before. Huh? Why don't you show us? How you entertained that Gyptian boy... on the beach? How you witched him. No? Hmmm... ..won't play, won't talk... ..maybe she'll sing. Yeah... ..that's right, we hear you. When you think... ..no one's looking, when you... when you think no one's watching... ..and no one's looking, we hear you. Can't speak, but can screech like a fucking Lapwing. [Laughs] Why don't you give us a song? Could use a laugh. [Stutters/stammers] What's that, Patience? [Stutters/stammers] I don't know that one myself. [Stutters/stammers] Poor little Patience. All alone in the woods. P-P-P-P-Patience... [Trees creak and grown] It's alright... ..he shouldn't have done that... ..shouldn't have tried to shame you. I should have stopped him. It's not right. There's something about you, Patience. You scare him... ..you do. He can't control you and it makes him sick... ..drives him mad... ..then, it would drive any man mad. It's alright, Patience, you don't need to pretend anymore. It's all a game to you, isn't it? I've seen you, look at me... hmm. Catching my eye, sending me smiles. I know what you're doing Patience. A man can read the signs. Pl... nnn... nnn...[Stutters/stamm nnn... nn...[Stutters/stamme nnn... nn... nnnn...[Stutter [Squelch of a knife through flesh] [Choking] [Heavy panting] [Cries out] [Grunting] They were right, weren't they? Weren't they? Jacob and Mathilde. All this time, putting your charms on me. Witching me. Huh? [Sobbing] Ah, you're the devil aren't you. Oh God. You're the devil, aren't you. [Grunts and groans] Devil... Devil... Devil... [The wind and trees fade into grunts] [Gasp] [Heavy breathing] [The fire crackles] [A soft cry] [Bird song] I need you to get up. Come on. [Slow-burn ominous music] I need you to get undressed. Please. Please. Come on. Take off your clothes. Wait here until I come back. I won't be long. Understood? Yeah. [The cart clanks over the uneven ground] [Singing] One of them said to his mate, Where shall we our breakfast take? With a down, derrie, derrie, down, down. [The thud of drums in the distance] [Strange, distorted singing] [Thunder claps] Devil. Put them on. [Birdsong] Come on, get up. Come on. [Ominous music] [Birds caw in the distance] [The trundling of the cart] Listen to me, Patience. We both know what happened last night. We both know what you made me do. I know what you did and you know really, don't you? Huh? But we don't want anyone else to know, do we? We don't want anyone else thinking dangerous thoughts. Because they wouldn't understand. Would they? They wouldn't see this as something best kept between us. You and your little tricks. And it will Patience. I'll tell them. I'll tell them all, if that's what you want? What would your sister say? Huh? If she knew what you were? [Ominous drum beat] Fucking disgusting. [Sniffs] Stop it! [The crack of breaking wood] You're back. Patience. What are these? David. What are these? Where's Jacob? [Foreboding music grows] I'm sorry, I'm sorry Mathilde. No wife should have to hear this, but Jacob left me with no choice. David, where is he? Mathilde. What is going on? Well, it's a shameful thing that's going on. A shameful thing, but your husband is a thief and an adulterer. What are you talking about? I don't know what else to say Mathilde. That a man would do that to his wife. Do that to his people. Do what? There was a girl, on the road, a common strumpet, he disappeared with her, believe me when I say I tried to warn them off, but- I thought he'd spend himself with her and come crawling back. But he didn't. We looked everywhere for him, didn't we Patience? Didn't we look everywhere for him? I'm so sorry, Mathilde - and after everything you've given up for him. Mathilde. Mathilde. That's not the worst of it though, Jacob was holding the money for the sale, when he disappeared to wet his wick. All of it? All of it indeed, Kat. All of it. It's a sorry thing what he's done to us all. What he's done to Mathilde. It's a terrible thing, to do that to a woman and the children. It's a terrible thing. How'd she, get those clothes then, if the money's gone? I bartered for them is all? If you must know, Patience tore her dress while pushing that barrow I wasn't gonna have one of my own arriving in the grand hall with her petticoat on show, now was I Kat? You're a cold sot Kat. Thinking of clothes at a time like this. When a woman's just lost her husband? Really? It's like I said. It's terrible thing what happened, you do well to remember that. We wait for the boat to come in for the gyptians. I'll go collect the money. Divvy it up, and then we move on. Go our separate ways. [Scrubbing] [Whimpers] [Sobbing] [The wind whistles] [Choral singing] [Patience desperately tries to speak] [Stutters/stammers her name] [Sobbing] [ Broken sobbing] [The rushing of the sea] I came for you last night. Waiting, I wanted to see you. There is something wrong? Please, look at me, look. Look at me. [Spits] [Thunder rumbles] David. [Grunts] Why did Patience get those clothes? [Sighs] Fuck, Liz, I already told you She ripped her dress. That money was for us, our future. You, me, our child. What happened to putting us first? I always put us first. What is this David? That, my beautiful wife, is mine. From the gyptians. Money. Liar. Excuse me? My God. How could you do this to them? I'll have nothing to do with this. God will never grant us a child for this. You're right Liz, you're always right. I led us on a dark path. I see that now. I didn't mean to. Everything I that do, I do for you. I do that for Patience, too. I'm sorry. No. No. You think I'm blind to this, you do. You think I'm blind to this. But I see, I see them, I see the way they look at me. - I see the way you look at me. - David. All I've done is protect you, but does anybody see that? No. No, they don't, you, you don't see that. Even you don't see that. I do see that. No. No. No, you're with them out there. Oh, you're with them out there, aren't you? They've wormed their way in to you. They've wormed their way into you- and I need to cut it out. Will you tell me I need to cut it out? Is that right for me to fucking do? Get up, you fuck. - No - No one could turn me against you. Fuck. You. Fuck. You're everything to me. You, and Patience, you girls. You're everything to me. You, you're everything to me. You and Patience. You girls. You want me dead. You want me dead. I fucking smell it. No, no, no, you're my husband. Then maybe I do it for you, huh? - No, don't. Don't. - Maybe I do it for you? Stop it. Stop it. [Sobbing] Where is he? He's gone to the village. We're leaving then, you should come with us. I can't Kat. Then let us take Patience. No. I can't leave. Neither of us can. He won't let us go. Well, if you change your mind, we'll be at Fishtoft. There's work there. God speed to you both. I shall miss you and your squawking, little lapwing. [Desolate music] [Cheering and chattering] Put it down. Get on with it. Alright, alright, alright. Ready? It's all going in. Come on then. Go on, go on. Come on. [Cheering] Liar, these are loaded. [Desolate Music] [Sobbing] [Thunder rumbles] [Unnerving Music] [Thunder claps] [Axw scraping wood] [Music builds] [Screams] [Grunts] [Screaming] [Thud] Get off her, get off. [Smack..smack..smack] [Yells] [Screaming - spluttering] [Sobbing] [Screams] This is the way it is. This is the only way it has to be. The only way, I can save our souls, [Thunder claps] forgive our sins. It's the only way we can be together. This is what you've always wanted, what you've always wanted. [Sobbing] but I'm so tired. I'm so tired But I'm gonna make it better. I'm gonna make it better. I'm gonna make it better. No, David. No. It's the only way. No..no..no..David. No..no..no, please. I'll make it quick, I promise, I just wanted to say... [Squelch] P... P... P... It's beautiful... [Thud] [Whimpering] [Hopeful music]
