GO now. Next. Quickly. Hey, you, bastard! Don't touch my water! When I'm done drinking. Don't touch, I'm telling you! Help! Help! He can't swim! He's going to drown! Help! Help! Come on, come on, to work! Take him to the tent. To work. Wait for me outside, Clay. To work. The show is over. Let's hurry. To work. It's not a big deal. He drank the cup, that's all. You were brave, but it could have cost you dearly. I told you to be careful. Your eyes are a mess. I am not an eye specialist, but in your place, I would avoid to fight. One punch and you can be blind forever. I'll try to keep myself cool. I know it's a tour de force to stay 20 years in a corner like here without having trouble with anyone. Maybe less, doctor. - Perhaps less. - Try to escape. They would get you back in 24 hours. We would offer them a nice reward. And lots of people would love to stop the best trigger in the Union. I know. Clay, tell me the truth. Does it really exist, this witness you mentioned in court? Maybe. So why did he not testify? Go ask him. Who is it? What would that be for, doctor? To reopen the file. Just to make me happy? Come on, it's junk! He would say it was self-defense. Is it true that you shot with your eyes closed? It happens, when it amuses me. - How do you do it? - I smell them like dogs. If what I'm told is true, you must have a sixth sense. Do not move! Throw down your weapons! You too! - Clay, you don't stand a chance. - We will see! If there is one that moves, I'm taking the doctor down! Do you believe me now? Do not pull! Throw down your gun. Get off your horse. Don't try to stop me. Is that clear? Get off. For you, the journey is over. What are you going to do? On the other side is New Mexico. Helping friends over there. I have a lot of lead. I don't risk getting caught. As far as you are concerned, within an hour or two, the soldiers will come and get you. One day or another, they will find you. They will find me when I decide. And at that moment... I will be able to prove my innocence, if I am not dead. In either case, I will be free and no longer a prisoner... like today. Come on, give me all your money. I only have 20 dollars. We are poorly paid by the state. That's enough. Hold out. You will need it against the Indians and the beasts. I knew you were crazy, but not at this point. Clay, if I want, I can kill you! Yes, I know, but you have to want to! Goodbye, doctor! Your son will be happy to see you. They shouldn"t be long. Don't we have the right to touch the daughter-in-law? Think a bit. The chief only wants Ortiz's father. Here they are. Bastards! Assassins! - The chief wanted him alive. - He was going to shoot! - Take a look in the cart. - Someone comes! He doesn't look like he's armed. Take care of him. We're leaving, Tom. You will tell the chief that you killed the old man. You don't have a sense of hospitality in New Mexico. Gather the horses and go. They could come back. Understood? - He's dumb. - Rather hard of hearing. Nobody ever gives him orders except me. I have to thank you. Why? Because you saved my life. I defended my skin, yes. Who was that? Domingo Ortiz's father. Ah! - You're with the Mexicans? - I'm Ortiz's wife. - And you? - Nobody's husband. I mean, you, which side are you on? I am independent. In any case, for the moment. And in the future? I will see. In the village I will say that they come to pick you up. In your place, I would try to avoid Mesa Encantada. It is a man named Fox who runs the village, and he's dangerous. I like dangerous people. You just killed a man of Fox. I don't like Fox's men. - This one, for example! - Who is he? Minnesota Clay. Here is one who could restore order here. Jake, be kind to serve me. I'm yours, Nancy. Some water. We don't serve water here. Do you know someone named Fox, Five Aces Fox? Are you coming here to ask such questions? And I think that you must be hard of hearing. I'll ask you the question again. Do you know a guy named Fox? You want to know things, do you. Here we are fast on the trigger. It's the same for me. Whoever was with you this morning could have told you. He plays dead now. Are you the one who shot my brother down? What are you looking at? It is an ordinary revolver. Yes, it's an ordinary revolver, except that the guy who holds it is named Minnesota Clay. Hi, Fox. You are lucky to have been born under a lucky star. Get out. Get out all of you! It's been a long time. Since the day I had to kill the Luke brothers. - You were there. - Yes I remember. Why didn't you attend the trial to say that I had acted in self-defense? I was wanted. That's why I couldn't testify. That day, someone... forced the Luke brothers to provoke me. I know who. Why did you do that, Fox? It is the children who ask why! And the hatred we have for someone is often inexplicable. See, you're faster than me. This is one reason like any other. I warn you. Don't try to take advantage of your advantage. The law condemns anyone who kills a sheriff. Tell me very sincerely, it must surprise you that the old fox has moved to the other side of the barricade. Doesn't that amaze you? Don't play with it too much. Be very careful with this thing. I won't shoot you down. I need you alive, not dead. I know it well. Clay, I'll make you an offer. - Join my gang. - No thanks. It does not interest me. I take what I want. Mr. Clay! - Hi, Mr. Clay! - Clay is enough. Not sir. You are famous here. I know the Dallas case, the duel in San Antonio. Andy Barrett. You were a friend of my father. I saw you shoot this guy. It was great! He was pointing at you and you continued to move forward. He fired, you jumped off your horse, and presto! And I took a bath. How did you go about it? I want to learn to do the same. Please take me as a helper. - Why? - To clean up the country. From what? Didn't you come here to tidy up? - No. - Help us, Mr. Clay. Clay. Here, life is hell. First, there was the Ortiz gang, the Mexicans. They robbed and killed mercilessly. We are peaceful. We did not rebel. The people of the village instructed Fox to deliver them from Ortiz. It was worse. He made himself a sheriff and became the master of the country. So we have two bands: One inside, the other outside. While waiting for one to eliminate the other, they attack those people who would like to live in peace. This was always like that. I will not join any camp or take on a helper. I could be of help to you. Teach me how to shoot a pistol. Do you want to find yourself in the cemetery, like So many young people? - But... - Don't insist, Andy. I know what to do. I am going to the hotel. Above all, do not go there. This is the headquarters of Fox'S men. Look, here they are coming! Every day they cross the village and have fun scaring people. Attention, Nancy! Hey Dutch, I bet a Dollar that you can't get that one. You'll see! Don't shoot! Put that rifle away. - I want revenge. - It's an order! Cease fire, everyone! - Save your ammunition for Ortiz. - That's bad luck. Now was the time or never to get rid of him. We will create the opportunity ourselves. Thank you. Without you, I would never have been able to make it. What is it? Do you have any discomfort? Answer. - What are you feeling? - It's nothing. Nothing. Dirt in the eye. And you, how are you? Now better, yes. When the shots rang out, my horse got carried away. Your face is covered with dust. A little water will do you good, sir... Clay, Minnesota Clay. No thanks. I am Nancy Mullighan. This is the first time that I see you. You are not from the Fox Gang... or the Ortiz gang? No. I'm just passing by. Before you go, you should visit us. I live with my uncle Jonathan, near the river. We had a school, but my uncle is too old, So I am replacing him. Once a week, in the judge's office. But I'll have to give it up. People no longer send their children there. What you have seen is common. It is getting more serious every day. That will change, I assure you. It will be fine. He calmed down. Go home quietly, Nancy. I'm going to visit the Miltons. I have medicine for their daughter. Here you are! Nancy, I knew Mr. Clay would be able to stop your cart. It wasn't difficult for Mr. Clay... I mean for Clay. You're too late, Andy. We don't need you anymore. - You know each other. - I met him a few times. We have known each other for almost 10 years! But by sight, that's it. Well. Decide for yourself whether or not you know each other. But one thing is certain... Nancy's horse is still nervous. It would be better if you took her home. Heard you, Clay. Do not worry. If anyone needs an escort, it's Andy. Why do you say that? It makes me happy to go with you. Escort each other. I'll bring her home safe and sound. - Goodbye, Nancy. - Goodbye. Hi Andy. Goodbye! Hey! Are you going? Wait for me! I have to escort you! Wait for me, Nancy! Jonathan... I won't have anything until Tuesday. I lack dry wood, scrap metal. And above all, I lack inspiration. By all the saints! Clay! In the flesh. You don't seem happy to see me. I'm glad you're alive, but that's it. You shouldn't have come back. Leave this cursed country immediately, it is the shame of men. Do you know Drunner? It is a forced labor camp. This is where I was a prisoner. It makes me happy to see you again. But go on your way. It is better for you and for everyone. My path ends here. I am at home. My daughter is here. You saw her? Yes, I saw her. This morning. A girl like Nancy... You are wrong to let her circulate alone. This wouldn't have happened if she had had a real father. I did what I could for her. I served as a father, mother, doctor, uncle, brother. I gave her everything, except the breast, of course, but that is more nature's fault than mine. Well... that's the past, all that. But while her mother died giving birth to her, you had gone on an adventure. Is it true that Nancy is as beautiful as her mother? Yes. That is true. Nancy... she's a spitting image of her mother. When I saw her, I thought it was Betty. - Does she know about me? - No. I told her her father was dead too. It is wiser. I thank you for everything you have done for my daughter. It gives me a funny feeling to use that word. I understand you, Clay. But Nancy mustn't know the truth. I'll never tell her. I swear. Mexicans! Good evening, my friends. Hey, American! The general wants to meet Minnesota Clay. Who is the general? Don Domingo Ortiz Mendoza. Everything you see is his. Well... I arrive, friend. See you soon. You saw nothing, heard nothing. Understood? Here we are. Goodbye, Andy. I hope you don't blame me too much for going with you, but Clay asked me to. Yes, Clay. Funny, that's not the name he told me. What was he doing with us with 2 men from the Ortiz gang? - You know him? - Yes. Minnesota Clay, he is a friend of my father. Your uncle knows him too. He came to teach me how to shoot. And when I do, neither Fox nor Ortiz will lay down the law. No! I refuse to spend my life bringing flowers to your grave. But then, you care about me! You care about me... As far as I'm concerned, that's not the case. Is that clear? Yes, Mr. Jonathan. I just drove Nancy back. Do not get mad. Here he is. And one for avenging my father. And two for having refused the proposal of that bastard Fox. And three, because I too have a little proposal for you. What do you want from me? Help me get rid of Fox. I heard you were a better shot than Fox. If you kill him, I'll reward you. Why do you want me to shoot him? Ask your men. You can enter and leave the village as you want, not my men. We are only safe here, and Fox in his village. The first to put his nose out gets shot by the other. I have enough. I want you to help me become the sole master of Mesa Encantada. Give me a drink! Refusing wine to a lady back home, it's as if we wanted to insult her. That is true. When a pretty woman offers you a drink, you must drink, amigo! He might not be thirsty, who knows? We want him to drink anyway. Isn't that right, general? Estella is right. It is offending his host to force him. I don't care, I can't take strangers and it is no exception to the rule! I guessed why you're so scared of Fox, General. You are assisted by fools. Stop! You see, if another would have told me half of it, he would already be dead! And who would have killed me? You, Ortiz? Or that pickaxe head? I am aiming between your two eyes. Wow! You are as fast as lightning. By giving you this money, I got the best deal of my life. So, do we have a deal? Your offer is interesting, but give me time to think it over. Think about it until tomorrow. Estella, prepare what you need. He's going to sleep here. He can think about it as much as he wants. Isn't it true? Wake up! I am awake. I can only sleep with one eye closed. - What do you want? - Your life is in danger. - I know how to defend myself. - You're deluding yourself. You must get away without delay. I am not afraid of anyone. And Ortiz was kind. He will change his mind when he finds out... that there is a reward for your head. - How do you know? - I have informants. Ortiz is going to attack Jonathan's farm, your friend. - Is that true? - Why would I lie? What do I know? How can the fate of my friends or mine interest you? I don't care about your friends. But you I don't forget, I owe you my life. Recognition does not exist. And why does he attack a farm? Ortiz wants to burn everything to attract Fox and face him in a duel. Okay. Let's go. Not around here. Come that way. - Goodbye. - Goodbye. Thanks, Estella. You know this remains to be done. Do not pull! It's me, Clay! Come closer, Mr. Clay! I didn't recognize you! - Are you alone? - Yes. Uncle Jonathan had to go down to the village. It is better to be careful. When I'm alone, I don't let anyone near even if it is necessary to shoot. My uncle had an appointment with the judge... I shouldn"t be telling you that. I don't know what's on your mind. Did Jonathan tell you nothing about me? No, nothing. If not that you were his friend and a first-rate shooter. This is my mother. Ah yes, your mother. And this is her medal that I have. I have one, too. Look. We saw a lot of them at the time. They go well together. I give it to you as a present. Thank you. Nancy! Oh it's you. Why did you come back? What do you want? I want to talk to you. It is pointless. It does not lead to anything to talk. Today I had to bring $ 50 to that Fox thief. It represents a fortune to me. They won't leave until they've taken our last dime. We should take action, but everyone is fleeing. Basically, we are all cowards. We better give up and get the hell out of here. That is indeed an idea worthy of a coward. If that is what you came to tell me you can go! Jonathan, you are going to listen to what I have to say. What gives you the right to give orders to my uncle? It's a long story. Nancy, go to bed and leave us alone. Ortiz will not be long. You have to go. I am not running away. A reward is offered to anyone who will bring me back. $ 10,000 is a pretty good sum. They put a reward out for an escapee. This money would allow you to buy a small farm away from Mesa Encantada. Nancy and you could live there peacefully and happily. So here is what I decided. You're going to go with Nancy to Drunner's camp. Denounce me, tell them I'm here. Captain Warren will come and find me. No. I will never denounce a friend! Calm down. I know what I'm doing. I am not crazy. The presence of the federal police in the village will force the Mexicans and Fox to be quiet. And maybe I'll get Fox to tell them what he knows to clear me. For once, I will have done something that will benefit everyone. Think about it, Mr. Fox. $ 80 a day is too much for us. We cannot pay this amount. Try not to pay, and you will see. Tranquility has a price. My men are costing me a fortune. Defending this town against Ortiz is very risky. Then you will pay me. All right, Judge? That's enough! Who is it? A man named Andy. He lives on the outskirts of the village. Why do you beat him up? Because he refuses to pay. This is the opportunity to make an example of it. You hear? Understand. A message for you, boss. Now is the time to get down to business. Be ready to go when I tell you to. Gather everyone, even the reinforcements. If all goes well, we won't regret it. Come on, hurry up! You did a good job. Be careful, no one should see you. You will have to be back at the camp before daybreak. Fulgenzio! - What? What's the matter? - They stabbed him. What is happening? Ramirez was stabbed. - Who could have done that? - Quintin! Rafael! What happened? General! The safe with the money is gone! - It has been robbed? - Yes. Who was on duty? Here it was Ramirez. I was on the other side of the camp. But I didn't see anything at all. - Who did that? - I don't know. - Who took the money? - I dunno. - Tell me the truth! - I dunno. - Swear it to me! - I saw nothing, I swear! - Who is it? - I was there. Leave him! It is not him. It's the American. How do you know? He is no longer a prisoner. It can only be him. None of your men have ever stolen from you. He killed Ramirez, he stole the gold and he fled. Here is the proof. He saw the American flee. The bastard! I'll go looking for him in hell, if I have to! Miguel, get the men together. Francisco, post two men here. The others will come with me. The American will pay me for it. I swear. I give you my word! - I know where he is. - Where is he? At his friend Jonathan's, like the last time. You are definitely right. Otherwise, I will go to the village. Wait for me here. I will also settle his account with Fox. Mesa Encantada is ours! Death to the gringos! To the death of the gringos! Long live Ortiz! Hurry up, Jonathan. Nancy! Clay! Let's go! The Mexicans are coming! Fast, fast! - I'm covering that side. - Sit down. I'm hit but I can still shoot. Nancy, get down! Get down, I tell you! Hold this! It is loaded. A gun! Give me that. So much the better, she was awful. The hut is solid and we have ammunition. An hour or two, no more. Is there another way out? Yes. Behind the house. Andy, go test the area. Thank you. Are you not afraid? - Only for my uncle. - Calm down. The cart is there. We can run away. Francisco, Rafael, try an approach! It is better to stay covered. The American shoots well. Shoot, but shoot! - Save yourself! - And you? I'll join you soon. Go there quickly! You too, Jonathan! Okay. Goodbye, Clay. Climb, Nancy! Look, they are escaping! The American is not in the cart. Francisco, I see straw. Go set it on fire. Yes my general. We'll see if he's going to resist, the American. When he comes out I forbid you to shoot. I want to take him down myself. Hey, American! So are you going out? Or you prefer to die like a grilled pig? Come on, tell me where you put the money that you stole from me. Speak! Where did you hide my money? Take this! Talk, gringo! Damn it! We were ambushed. Hi, Ortiz. This meeting does not seem to delight you as much as me. You lose nothing for waiting! It was bound to happen sooner or later. General, the time has come to express your last wishes. I want to know who betrayed me! Haven't you guessed it? Hey, Estella! So was that you, bitch? General, don't be rude to a lady. I trusted you and you set a trap for me. It will not happen like that! Stop, that's enough! This time, we settled his account for good. Poor Ortiz. He was nice. Isn't that right, Estella? Congratulations. Everything went very well. Look at this... The American is still alive. Excellent news. I have to admit that Ortiz didn't give us a hard job. No, don't damage him too much. Just right. It would be silly to finish him off. Don't tell me you care about his life. It is worth 10,000 dollars. You are right. Take him back to the village. He will still serve us. Fine, gentlemen. You will get what I promised you. Poor Raschietto, are you worried? You wanted to shoot him, Minnesota Clay. Shut up, you, I didn't ring the bell! - You were brave. - Ortiz swallowed it all. It was even too easy. We only have one thing left to do. The inhabitants of Mesa Encantada will have to pay. And then... we'll get out of here. Flee? Why? One day or another... the army is going to meddle in our affairs, and things are going to turn out badly. Yes, you're right. Let's go, you and I, very far from here. - The high life is ours! - You and me? Today you want to live the high life with me. But you'll meet smarter men than the old Fox. So what... you will reserve the same fate for me as for poor Ortiz. Is it not true? Not, Estella. I have always trusted cards but never women. Cards aren't always on your side, but they don't kill. Be content with this present. For the work you did... it's already very good. Raschietto! What if they don't want to come? They will come. Call the judge, the doctor and the others. And Clay, what do we do with him? I don't forget that, don't worry. Go on, gentlemen. Hurry up. You should get some rest, Nancy. You must be tired. I'm worried. - Do you think he could have escaped? - Of course. Clay is very smart. He had to hide while waiting for the night. He's a resourceful guy. And remember, he is second to none as a shooter. Already as a youngster he achieved a lot. He hit his target with his eyes closed, without even aiming. His weapon is his passion. His faithful companion. I got rid of Ortiz for you. I want a reward. Forgive me, but we pay you every week. These were just down payments. Now I want the balance. I'll leave you a man worth a big reward. He is locked up there, well tied up, and he is getting ready to be executed. Yes, I had better leave him dead. Alive, he could be dangerous. As for me, I wouldn't want him to take Ortiz's place. This little attention will cost you $ 20,000. You will give it to me before tonight. Clay. Clay. Listen to me. It is important. Fox has already fired several of his guys. Did you come to tell me that? Yes. I want to help you. So... untie me. Don't you wonder why I'm doing this? You have already betrayed Ortiz. Now it's Fox's turn. You will kill him! He intends to leave me and run away with all the money he can raise, the bastard! You will avenge me. I wouldn't know anything better to do. But what will happen to you? When they find out that I have acted against Fox, they will leave me in peace. Good. - Is there no one outside? - No. The men are all at the saloon. Pretend you're drunk if we meet someone. Hey, compadre! What are you doing with this woman in your state? My pretty girl, leave him and come with me. Are you coming? Answer, let me see you. But I know you! It is you who... Go to sleep! - Do you know the place? - Yes. - Do you know where Andy lives? - Yes, but... You will take me there. If there are two of us, we won't be noticed. Andy! - Someone's coming. - It's Clay. - Jonathan! - He's in bad shape. - What did they do to him? - Sit down. We must go and warn the army. You're hurt. Andy is going to go. We must save the village. The army must arrive by tomorrow. - Or it will be too late. - Count on me. I will stay here and watch. If the situation worsens, I "I'll stop Fox myself. Andy will have to shoot down those who seek to stop him. All right, Clay. Only shoot if you are in danger. Andy! Please don't be reckless. I will think of you and I will be careful. You were the one who let him get away! Admit it! Why would we do this? He's an assassin, a convict. Yes, an innocent convict and also a great marksman. You hope to use him. Do you think I'll let myself be intimidated? No... Now you don't owe me $ 20,000, but another $ 50,000! You'll give them back to me with Clay in an hour. If you don't follow my orders to the letter, with every passing hour, I will kill one of you. The countdown has begun. Okay, good. We will do our best. But Minnesota Clay... You will also deliver him to me within an hour. You did see? My men are nervous. Very nervous. He's going to kill a person every hour that goes by. That's what Jonathan said, you heard it. What do you think you will do? Answer. I can't let these people die because of me. But what are you going to do? Confront them without delay. There are five men. They will kill you. In the saloon for sure. But I'll wait for them outside, and you'll tell him. It's risky... but it will save a life. Yes. Clay, we're going to put both of our lives in jeopardy. Looks like Fox is more keen on finding you than having the money. He's not going to be disappointed. I'll give him what he wants. Give me a gun. I need one. No. As you are, you don't have a single chance. Give me a gun, Jonathan! Okay! It's sweet as music. How beautifully they ring. Clay escaped. I know. And I also know who helped him escape. And you know it too. Isn't it true? This time, you weren't deceitful. You have played the cards on the table. Where is he? Outside. He's waiting for you. Who is with him? No one, Fox. He is alone. Give me the bible, Raschietto. And now swear it's not a trap. Swear to me that Clay is on the street and that no one is with him. Be very careful, Estella. This will be your last oath. Then you will die. I'm not afraid, Fox. I am no longer afraid of anyone. Clay is alone outside! Swear it. Swear it! I swear it, I swear it! Kill me if you want, but you'll pay for it! Listen. There is one thing left to do before ending this day: Liquidate Clay. Is that clear? Get rid of her. You sure have it, Fox. This bastard is half blind. He shoots while looking up to the sky. Clay! Let yourself be seen! The final game is between you and me the decisive part, Clay! Fox! I know you're here, Clay. But you don't shoot because you hope to take me alive so that I may testify on your behalf. I also know that you can't see clearly anymore. I would have liked to kill you slowly, in front of your daughter. Do you remember? This is where we met her mother, Elisabeth, a long time ago. But for me, it's like it was yesterday. 18 years old. I have had a stubborn hatred for you for 18 years. I hate you since the day you laid eyes on Elisabeth. I hate you ever since she preferred you over me. Now I got you, Clay. And I want to make your Killing last. Your magazine is empty. I counted the shots fired. I can no longer see clearly, but I can hear very well. You'll have to stay there until the soldiers arrive. I want to see you hanged. But I won't hesitate to shoot if you try to run away. Come on. Clay is inside. He's blind and I can kill him. If you want me to spare him, move forward in silence. Clay! Please, Clay! He wanted me to shoot you. What a coward! It was on you that he wanted to pour out his hatred. I was about to shoot when I heard your bracelet jingling. This is the sound that saved you. I would have liked to deliver him alive to the soldiers because Fox was the only one able to testify... of my innocence. Fox cleared you in front of everyone in the saloon. Nancy, so I'll made it... Clay! Help! You will receive the reward for arresting Minnesota Clay, even though his innocence has been established. He will be rehabilitated, I'm sure. The village will find peace. Reopen your school. Thank you. Clay, hurry, we've got a long way to go! Come on! Yes, if I see anything with it! Dr Stevens said you shouldn't take them off. Here we are! Forward! It's incredible. This guy has seven lives, like cats. Take care of her. I will be back for your wedding. - Stay. - A formality to settle. He's a good boy. You will be happy. Goodbye, Clay. Goodbye. Do you think he's coming back? I'm sure. I would put my hand in the fire for it. Goodbye! Goodbye, Clay! Bye! Did you tell him? No. I did not have the courage. But it's better. Take care of her, like you always have. Goodbye. Goodbye, friend.
