It's so goddamn black out there. Pilots won't come here unless there's red illum. No moonlight. Alisa was really freaked when I told her I was coming here. Do yourself a favor, man. Don't call home. Like Sergeant Romesha. Fucks with his head too much to call home, right, Ro? I'll call home when I'm on a bird out of this valley. Until then, don't think about your wives. Goddamn it, fuck. Sir, sir. Is he fucking smoking hash again? Come on, Faulkner, for fuck's sake. Black night X-ray, this is Husky 2. We're one minute from bringing the boys in and deliver the blow. Roger, that Husky 2. This is X-ray. Thanks for making our troop whole. Unload from the right. Home, sweet home, warriors. All right, Sergeant. Holy shit, guys, we're here. Hey, how you doing, guys? - Captain! - How you doing, sir? Welcome to the dark side of the moon, gentlemen. Delighted, sir. Jesus, Yunger, get your fucking head down. Carter? I'll get the supplies, sir. All right, real men have arrived! Let's introduce some hot dollar. You guys are late to the party, man. Got my fucking bunk ready? Hey, new guys, bunks with the folded blankets are open. Make yourselves at home. Hey, you fucking pussies. Where am I bunking, cowgirl? I won't ask, if you won't tell. Ah, shit. Picking up tricks from the locals, I see, huh? - Good to see you, man. - Good to see you, bud. God, you smell like a bag of dicks. Well, I thought that was the musk you like. Hey, not that one, Cherry. That's Libert's. - Find a different bunk. - Who's Libert? What the fuck, man. Hey, show some respect, goddamn it. Who's Libert? Fuck you is who he is. Put that down. Go grab your bunk right there. Grab your goddamn bunk, man. Hey, nice to meet you, too, Sergeant. There's no way I'm going underneath you unless it's fucking made out of titanium. - You understand? - Keep talking. I'm gonna kick that fucking ass, man. You don't know what muscle looks like, boy. Yeah, fuck you, too. Come here, man. Give me a fucking hug. Hey, you can't move the castle diagonally. I'm your superior. I can move it however the fuck I like. That's what I'm saying. I don't think I would stand a chance. At least we have a garden. - A real Garden of Eden. - Gotta be shitting me. Look at this place. Yeah, the Taliban have a nice fucking view of us, don't they? - Fuck me, man. - Fucking retarded, I know. They usually come up that draw, on the back side, take a few fucking shots, and then just, like, get the hell out. Aren't we supposed to be on top of the mountain to win this thing? Don't be logical, Scusa. Yeah, let's get moving. This is a joke, right? Not funny ha ha. It's more like a black comedy. Shit. I love getting fucked in this shit bowl. Man, we're not fucked. Maybe this place is like an opportunity, you know? Yeah, how do we protect this piece of shit? Better question would be, "Why?" What do you mean, boys? Like they say, freedom ain't free. - Tighten this motherfucker. - Sitting fucking ducks. - Good morning. - Hey there, Martin. - Hello, brother Martin. - Well, hello. Must be the honkies. Heard someone talking about freedom. Speaking of a black comedy... - Already at it, huh? - Oh, yeah. Working on a beast, this big motherfucker right here. How'd it get out here? Some colonel in Jalalabad had something to prove. Brought this big motherfucker over here through these shitty-ass roads. Yeah, risked life and limb, but just not his own. Fucking officers. Yeah, heard that story before. Yeah, it's the Tali's favorite target. They take at least one shot at it every day. Hey, leave that dog alone! What the fuck you doing? Hey, hey, it's okay. What the fuck was that? The dog, it has, uh, fleas. Yeah, we all have fucking fleas. It doesn't mean you gotta fucking kill it, motherfucker! Field to Red Dragon, contact. Taliban's firing from the Olive Garden! Got it! I see 'em, man. I see 'em. - Fuck. - Whoo-hoo! Come on, you motherfuckers! Asshole! Fucking watch it, fucking Yunger! What do we got? Sir, we've got RPGs from the Olive Garden and a fuck load of rifle fire. Damn. Bundy won again, huh? - I'm fucking out, Ro. - What? Ugh, I only brought my starter belt! Mace, Mace, we need more 240! Give me that 2-fucking-40, Mace! This is LRAS 2, we need more ammo. Over! Let's show 'em some love with the 1-20s. Willie and Pete. Carter! Can I help you, Carter? What the fuck you doing with my 240? - What the fuck you mean? - Where the fuck is my 240 ammo, man? Mace said LRAS 2, which is a 50 cal... Bullshit. I said 240! Go get my fucking ammo, man! - Well, then why didn't you say... - I fucking did! Stop talking, and go get the right ammo. Go, go! - Fucking Carter. - Fuck me, do your fucking job! Mortars, this is X-ray. CO wants you to put some 1-20s in the Olive Garden. I'll say again, 1-20s in the Olive Garden. Over. Thomson, we got Olive Garden, baby. Here we fucking go again! Let's light these motherfuckers up! Whoa, cease fire. Mace, cease fire! - We got 'em. - Whoo! - Good job, fellas. - Oh, he gone. - Hey, baby! - Well, that really blew some minds. Damn, that's cold, bro. - Too soon? - Mortaritaville saves the day again. This is Red 2. End of mission. Target destroyed. Thank you for your service, D-Rod and Thomson. Oh, man, that was the shit, man. I got it all. - You wait till you see this footage, boys. - Yunger. Yunger, you dick! Uh-oh. - Welcome home, Cherry. - You listen to me, Yunger. You ever a fucking fire a weapon at me that close again, and I'll fucking kill you myself. - Gallegos, stop. - Fucking understand me? - Gallegos! - Fuck you, Yunger. - You okay, Yunger? - I'm fine. - You good, man? - Goddamn Cherry shoots over my fucking head. - Hey, Yunger. - All right, guys. What? He could have fucking killed me! Get up, get up. What? Are you his mother now, Ro? We all learn lessons out here. - Leave that fucker in the dirt. - You're doing good, kid. I'm cool, Sergeant. I'm cool. You're cool, Yunger. Ah, check it out, Mace. Here comes my fucking 240 ammo. Typical Carter. - What a fucking day. - Is that it? Is that all? You can't argue and fight at the same time. - What? - You can't argue and fight at the same time. Don't do it again. Go on. Whatever. It's not gonna work that way. Get back here. Go to parade rest. Repeat after me. "I will not argue and fight at the same time." I will not argue and fight at the same time. Sound off this time. I will not argue. - Sound off! - I will not argue... Let's not ruin a beautiful morning, gentlemen. ...and fight... - Thank you for your service. - Thank you for your service. - ...at the same time. - Medic needs a fucking litter! - Aw, fuck! - Fucking move! You're gonna be okay, man. You're gonna be okay. Jacobs, come on. Stay with us, pal. Doc, what you need? Just keep everyone back. Jacobs, you're gonna be all right. I'm gonna need a fucking litter! I lost two of my brothers back home, fucking gang banging. They looked just fucking like that. I told you this place is a shithole. Yeah. Well, it's ours now. I'm coming, I'm coming. - Jesus, what the fuck happened? - The motherfuckers. All right, what do you need? That's it, this way. It's all you, Larson. My bad. Jacobs got out of surgery okay. They even say he's gonna fucking come back here. Holy shit, man. The guy lost half his fucking face. - Out. - That's fucking unbelievable. There's no way I thought he'd be back out here after that shit. Jacobs is a squared away dude, man. Squared away ain't got nothing to do with it, ham balls. You're a cherry. You're a private. You don't know. Fenty was squared away. Fritchy was squared away. - Snail. - Who's Snail? Snail was one of the best soldiers we knew. And just like that, he was shot in the face in Iraq, out of nowhere. Yeah. Doesn't matter what kind of soldier you are. Good, bad. As far as I'm concerned, we all stay alive out here, we win. You guys got any extra charges for the shitters? By the wack shack, man. There's an ammo can full of 'em. Take 'em all. Jesus, call to prayer. Five times a fucking day, man. Ro, you in or you out? - I'll play for him. - I'll take two. Sit here, look through these cards. Smoking hash isn't the answer. There's only 54 of us. That's it. And we all count on each other. You being high out there endangers all of us. It's not gonna happen again, sir. You're not the only one who came here with substance abuse issues. But you're the only one who persists. I should kick you out of here... - I don't have a substance abuse issue. - Yes, you do. You do. Mmm-hmm. I'm busting you down to private, and you're burning shit till I tell you to stop. One more chance, okay? - Sir. - You're dismissed. Thank you, sir. Evening, sir. Maybe he should forfeit some pay. Pay don't mean nothing to these guys out here. You take away their free time, it's like being in prison. Hi, guys. Hey, hey, listen up. Hello! - Is this thing working? - Yes, sir. Loud and clear. The army made it, nope. - This everybody? - Yes, sir. Okay. Look, we're making great progress here in Kamdesh, but we still got a lot of work to do. Our outpost is still a target of insurgents, - in case you hadn't noticed. - Hmm, oh, right. So how do we do our jobs and stay safe? We need to keep a good relationship with the locals. Hmm? Respect keeps us safe. So we'll call for another shura. The lead elders in the valley will attend. They will bring some of the younger men with them. Probably some of those assholes who've been shooting at us. That's right. You know they are. I will continue to speak softly in the valley, offering more projects and handshakes. But on the other hand, I will carry all of you like a big fucking stick. - Fuck, yeah, sir. - Sir. Only way this thing works. I'm afraid you don't have a big enough stick. That's right. All right. With your shield or on it. On our shields, sir. - Let's go. - Yes, sir. Yes, sir. Salam alaikum. Salam alaikum. Salam alaikum. Carter, Griffin. - Sir. - Sir. You boys are joining me. - Sir, some of those dudes are armed. - I noticed. Sir, there is a price on your head. That's why you're joining me. Keep your alien invader costumes on. Fuck the cigarette. Sorry, Dad. He says, "Why have you come here?" He says, you haven't been here for 40 years. No, no. That was the Russians. We're American. American. They really not understand this or they just fucking with me? Sir, it's 556. It's one of our bullets. Our job is to separate the Taliban and the ordinary people. We do that, the ordinary people won't get caught in the crossfire. I can give you money, contracts, projects, if you help. You know what this means? This man fired his rifle yesterday. We were attacked yesterday. I must report the attack on my outpost. I will lose honor with my elders. I can regain my honor in two ways. One way is for all of you to lay down your arms... ...and watch as your communities flourish with the help of the United States and Allah. And what is the other way? Why get into such ugliness? And of course, the United States will compensate anyone... ...who lays down their arms. Sir, these dudes shot at us yesterday. You wanna let 'em go? Yes, I do. You are a good guest. We will call you "Amat." "Highly praised one." - I love you. - I love you. - I love you. - I love you! - I love you. - If you don't say it like you mean it, - you'll be there all night. - I love you! - Louder! - I love you! Holy shit, mate. What the fuck? Fuck. Doing this gives you fucking cancer. Cancer? You fucking serious? Well, shit, who knows what these assholes are shitting out. Could you stop while I've got my fucking face in it? Shit detail is the Agent Orange of today. Just stop talking, man. Doing should be against UCMJ. This shit gives you cancer. Fucking kills you. What's so funny, Carter? Hey, this ain't no fucking laughing matter, man. That you think it's cancer that's going to kill you. Yeah, he fucking got you there, Mace. Good of you to make it, Faulkner. What's that? Late as always. I was picking up charges for Mortaritaville, asshole. Well, fucking done here, man. I've seen the pictures, bro. She's a classy lady. - They've been making the rounds. - Classy? What the fuck? They're good, man. Shit. Look, fuck it, anyway. I'm remarrying the woman I divorced. And she's pregnant by some other fucking dude. Yeah, well, have fun with that, buddy. Gonna raise the kid like they're my own. - Great idea. - Huh! I never really took you for the saint type there, Gallegos. Love is love, Hardt. Love is fucking love. I hear you. - There he is. - Camel Lights, right? Thanks. These are not Camel Lights. Hey, Taliban motherfuckers! Not so tough without night vision, huh? ♪ Party every day ♪ I love you. - Hey, Mace. - Yes, Sergeant? Trying to wake up all of fucking Nuristan here? Sorry, Sergeant. You smell like dog shit, Mace. Thank you, Sergeant. - I love you. - I love you. - I love you. - Love is in the air. That's good. Oh, shit. Goddamn, Mace. I picture you more of like a name tag kind of guy. Like a waitress. I was a Home Depot salesman. Was that before or after you got kicked out of the Marines? - Here you go. - Oh, thanks. I didn't get kicked out of the Marines, Sergeant. I got demoted for fighting. I had a little bit of a temper problem back then, so I got out. So you took your marine skills to Home Depot? No, then I was a cook at Denny's. I was a lumberjack, projectionist at my local theater. And then I was a sales associate at Home Depot, but only at Christmas time, Sergeant. After that, I cleaned, helped take care of the elderly, worked on cars for a little while as a mechanic. Not certified, but still a fucking mechanic. I was a barnacle sweeper for a small period of time. After that, I was lugging around hot tubs to different houses, but we call them hot tub transporters. Then the Army took me. - I love you. - You hearing this guy? Remind me not to stand next to him in the middle of a firefight. - Excuse me, Sergeant? - You heard me, Carter. Okay, we're gonna settle this Mini-Me and Gary Coleman argument once and for all. And, uh, no temper problem now? Carter? Oh, I love you. Touch glove, make love. Come on, boys! You boys are real calm until you get some shrapnel stuck in your ass. How much longer is it gonna be? - Scusa, hurry up before my grandma dies, man. - Hey, Scusa. Two minutes, man. Hugs and kisses to the the missus. - Come on. - No, no, no. - They love it. They love it. - Hey, Scusa. Yo, I wanna see one of your wife in costume, man. Hey, you know what? Jesus! fuck! Hey, get to fucking cover. - Gallegos, take point. - Tree top, tree top. Shit, shit, shit. On me, on me! Where the fuck is he? Yunger? This better be a fucking joke! Sir? Give me that fucking photo, you sick little fucker! - Get out here! - You dirty bastard. Are you jerking off to my fucking wife? Get the fuck out here! Are you fucking kidding me? - I'm sorry, okay? She's so pretty. - Get the fuck down! Yunger, you were beating your meat to his wife? Say you're fucking sorry. Start pushing! I'm sorry, Olivia. I'm sorry, Olivia. - Huh? - I'm sorry. It's "Mrs. Hardt." I'm sorry, Mrs. Hardt. - Are you fucking kidding me? - Ow! Loud and clear. - Loud and fucking clear. - What's up, sir? Boss wants us to move that damn LMTV back to Naray. Seriously? Why? I guess they need it. That's bullshit. Sir, that thing is way too big to navigate these shit-ass roads. Well, it got here somehow. Everybody who brought that monster over here was almost killed. The roads are too small. It's more dangerous than the goddamn Taliban, especially after the rain, sir. You know, I'm close with the CSM over there. I could reach out. Guys, brass gave us a mission. We're gonna deliver like we always do. All right. Who are we gonna get to drive it? Sir, are you sure you wouldn't rather have one of the enlisted men behind the wheel? Can't always have all the fun, Bundy. You're in command now. Please, try not to invade Pakistan or something. I'll do my best, sir. Please be careful, sir. Captain Keating, sir. We're here, Red 5 Delta. Go ahead. Wanna make a little room, Sergeant? This is Red 5 Delta. Sir, I just had a thought. Shouldn't Gallegos be driving the truck? I mean, that's how he got his whole family across the border. Over. Oh, boy. Here it comes. Bitch! I could fuck you for that, white boy, but your freaky ass might fall in love. It's gonna take 'em all night just to travel 13 fucking miles, man. Fucked up, sir. Yes, it is, Kirk. Yes, it is fucked up. Captain, the bees eat through the sugar in just a few days. It's a time release barrier, so the bees get used to the queen's pheromones and don't kill her. I wouldn't touch anybody else's fucking honey except my own. And here I thought we'd run out of things to talk about. Don't worry. I got it, Sergeant. - I trust you, sir. - Just hug these walls. That's a good idea, sir. Maybe it is time for you to call home, Ro. No, no. I call home, and all I'll end up doing is lying. What's the point in that? How about you, sir? You call home? Parents and my fiance, yeah, all the time. What about you, Carter? Oh, nobody wants to hear from me, sir. Oh, I doubt that's true. You don't know my ex-wife wife. Look, I'm proud to be here. I get it. I see it. We're gonna win by getting their hearts and minds. Yeah, we want their hearts and minds, and they want our blood and guts, right? Red 2, this is X-ray. We got a reaper on station in your vicinity picking up an unknown hotspot 200 meters ahead. Advise, proceed with caution. I'll go check it out, sir. What is that? It looks... It's a chicken. A dead chicken. It's just a dead chicken. Go on through. You know, Sergeant, I used to be a Mormon, too. I was raised as one, anyways. I'm not sure that's gonna make us friends, Carter. I don't need friends, Sergeant. At least not these guys. I got news for you. These guys are probably the best you're ever gonna do. Yeah, I don't, uh... I don't know about that. All this frat boy shit and joking around, got their fucking dicks in their hands, this is not the place for it, Sergeant. Marines would never go for what happens around here. - You know that. - Yeah, yeah, I remember. - You're a Marine. - Yeah. Guys, what's the holdup, huh? - Come on through. - What, man? I needed a leak. Look, I'm sick of your shit, okay? You wanna know why no one likes you? It's because you're always the odd man out. You're always on the fucking sidelines. Even if it is "frat boy shit," Larson's right. Nobody knows if they can trust you. Come on. Move. Watch it, ladies. Shit. Come on, Carter. - What's wrong with you? - I'm okay. Fuck! You know what, Sergeant? I don't care if I'm a specialist. Fuck! Oh, God. - Guys, what the fuck was that, man? - Six is down. We need ropes and a litter ASAP. We need immediate medevac. Six is down. The fucking LMTV came off a cliff. Fuck. That's good copy. Readings are all about now. Birds are about 40 mikes out. Send me the land line. Over. Ready, aim, fire. Ready, aim, fire. Ready, aim, fire. God, please watch over him and grant him passage into the next life. Amen. All right, guys. Back to work. I pledge allegiance to your pussy. Time's almost up, Griff. Specialist. Is that how mama taught you how to wear panties? Griffin, this is your new commander, Captain Yllescas. How are you doing, sir? Sir, those were Maria Kirilenko's. The tennis star. - She sent 'em as a gift, if you can believe that. - Is that right? Ah, well, who needs Toby Keith, when you can fucking sniff those. Yeah, we're a little short on recreation around here. Chris Cordova. - Hey, Rob Yllescas. - Nice to meet you. - And this is Dr. Courville. - Ah, good to meet you, sir. Griffin, help him with his bags. - Uh, yes, sir. - Thanks. To ever think we were enemies with the Russians. I guess the guys come in here a lot for these, huh? That and the working internet, sometimes. What do you guys deal with here mostly? Ah, it's mostly aid to the locals. Gunshot wounds when the assholes are firing at us. You guys got a MASCAL plan? It's not fucking good. We got this room for two and the cafe outside for two. We can't refrigerate blood. Once we drop the 9 line, it's almost two hours before we get any helos in here for medevacs. All right, what can I do? You can close this damn place down. Amen to that. Over here are ANA troops. In the back is our mortar pit. - Sir. - Oh, Lakis. He's our ANA trainer. - Nice to meet you. - Nice to meet you. I'm your, uh, coalition force from Latvia, sir. Great. How are the ANA soldiers? Some of them are okay when I can get them off of their asses. The 6th Kandek don't have the best reputation, sir. Hey, it's your chance to put your leadership on display. Embrace the suck. Embarrass the suck? Like I was saying, our mortar pit. Those guys, Thomson, Rodriguez, Breeding, they really save our asses, sir. - That so? - Yeah. Yeah, it's all numbers and angles. The mortars are the only thing that reach that ridge line. Without 'em, we're fucked. - Hey, brother Ro. - Oh, perfect. - Kirk. - Yeah. He's one of our best team leaders, sir. Meet Captain Yllescas. - Nice to meet you. - Sir. I wish we didn't have to meet you. I'll try to live up to all that. Good to have you, sir. Grab a fucking sponge. Get my back. Yeah, fuck yourself. Over here is our mosque. Gunfire! - Motherfuckers! - Goddamn it, shit! Treetops! Right! Come right! Brace yourself, boys! Get em! Get em! Hey, what do you think? You think the new boss is gonna make us do a fucking patrol every time they take a pot shot at us? Never try to understand the officer, Mace. A different breed. They even fuck with the lights on. Goddamn it, quit your bitching, man. This ain't so bad. Fucking nature walk with God, right, boys? If God was real, then these guys wouldn't be trying to kill us every goddamn day and Keating would still be around here. God works in mysterious ways, Sergeant. Yeah, so I guess God's plan is our chaos, then, huh? Jesus fucking Christ, man. What you looking at, Sergeant? Seeing what they see. What's that, Ro? Dead Americans. Goddamn, you're a fucking buzzkill, man. Every time they take a pot shot at us, they're figuring us out. When the big one comes, they'll have us dialed in. And how would do it, if you were them? What? How would you do it, if you were them? How would I do it? Well, first I'd knock out our mortar pit. Without that, we're fucked. Then I'd start hammering our stand-to trucks, armored Humvees, especially LRAS 2. That protects our mortars. Take out our ammo depot, so we can't resupply. And then I'd hit our generator, effectively kill our comms. And then I'd start sending fighters on the switchbacks. It'd be a race to get inside the wire before air support. Yeah, but even then it's gonna take a few hours. The B1s come all the way from fucking Qatar. Yeah, that's right, Carter. Yeah. I'd get inside our camp, take our ECP, divide us in half. Pretty much then we're fucked. Goddamn it, Ro. Who the fuck pissed in your Cheerios? Well... Sorry, pal. But that's life at Camp Keating. Any thought how we stop 'em, Sarge? We don't. - There you go. - I'm good. Hey, guys. You think what fucking happened to Captain Keating made it back to the news in the States? The only news people give a shit about back in the States is who's fucking Paris Hilton. Who the fuck hasn't? I saw her picture getting out of the car. Goddamn it, even the fucking hajis have seen her snatch. Yeah, 1 Night in Paris, Taliban bestseller. Ah, there you go. Goddamn it. It's a good day when God made my ass, right, sir? You know what? Somebody's gotta be fit around here for when we go hand-to-hand with these fucks. - Know what I'm saying? - If you go mouth-to-mouth, this war would be over. I'll fuck you till you love me, boy. You just keep working on those man tits, Gallegos. They're intimidated by it. Somebody's gotta win this fucking war, man. Okay. Let's go. Let me spot you, boy. Hey, Ro. Let's go, let's go. - Hey, Ro. - Come on. What's going on? Hey, how's it going, man? How you doing? Come here. Come here! Fuck! Shit. Warning shot! Fuck! Motherfucker. Jesus Christ! Watch where you're going, you haji fuck! Motherfucker. I should fucking wax you. - What the fuck, is he blind? - What's going on, Sergeant? What's this? What's this, huh? What's this? He's taking photos of our camp, sir. I'll fucking kill him. Fucker's taking photos. Must be to show the enemy what we see here from here. Huh, what is this? What is this? Is this a gift? Is this a gift from the Taliban? So, don't you want one? You're looking at my scars? Yeah, you'd be fucked up, too, if you had a kid-beating dad like my old man. And he was a fucking cop. Americans can have fucked up lives, too. Drunk a whole bottle of carpet cleaner once. I puked that up. Couldn't go through with it. I did have a great mom, though. I should probably call her... Did you ever see your mom, because of the... Didn't sign up for Jeopardy!, Thomson. Shit me. Uh, Sergeant. It's called a fucking burqa. A burqa, yeah. Um, what did he do? Told us the elders from Kamu paid him to take photos of our camp. Probably for the fucking Talibans. We'll call another shura, find out what the fuck happened. It is important that we find out which elders in Kamu paid Nasir. Good boy, good boy, not bad boy. What he was doing was a red flag for us. Red flag? A communist flag? - A warning sign. - Oh. It is important that we investigate. Your son will not be hurt. If he is innocent, he'll be back in two or three days. He says, you have broke Commander Keating's promise. You haven't paid them, and now you steal their children, too. This money? It's for building a school. For bringing power and water to... What's that place called? - Urmul, sir. - Urmul. But now I have to hold on to this. Until you help me. It is an honor to be among such courageous men. Men who love peace. Men who want that peace to spread. And the projects will spread. If we all work together. - Inshallah. - Inshallah. Inshallah. Half the Afghan men from the last shura are gone. Yeah. The fighting-age ones. - Griffin, come here. - Sir. You got a good handle on this shit, right? I mean, you're Cherokee or something, I don't know. You're a tribe. They're a tribe. It's Chippewa, sir. But, uh, you know, I didn't grow up smoking a peace pipe around the fire with my father and the tribal elders. But, uh, you know, I know not to piss them off. I know that we get shot at a lot less when the villagers are happy. That way we can focus on the mission. You know what our mission is? Not really, sir. Well, we can't accomplish our mission if we can't survive. The elders will come around. They need us as much as we need them. Yes, sir. Hey, Larson, you're SOG, right? - Yeah, what's up, Sergeant? - Mohammed, come here. Tell him exactly what you told me. - Salam alaikum, sir. - Salam, bro. I've just been to the village, sir. My sources are telling me the Talibans are coming on us. - Okay. - The villagers are not happy, sir. They are complaining about their money, the school, the road. The previous shura didn't go well, sir. Everything... And I really believe, sir, this time my sources are telling me that the Talibans are coming on us. - How many are gonna come on us? - A lot, sir. I don't know, a lot. You think like, um, in a row, or at the same time... Sir, are you laughing at me? - No, no. - I'm sorry. Sir, do you know what the problem is? The British invaded us, and they didn't listen to us. They thought we were stupid. - They were crushed down. - All right. The Russians invaded us. They thought we were stupid, and they were crushed down. Mohammed, Mohammed! And now you make the same mistake, sir! Mohammed, we don't need a fucking history lesson, Okay? - You know why we don't listen to you? - Why? Because every week, you tell us the same damn thing! - Because... - You're always crying... You're always crying wolf. Of course, we, we have the Taliban surrounding us all the time. We're in the middle of Afghanistan. We get hit every single day. You coming in and yelling, "The Taliban is coming. The Taliban is coming," is just added pressure, man. I don't need to learn about the fucking battle of Normandy from you. It's cool, man. We heard you. It's okay. - Sir... - Thank you. I have a little family. - I really don't want to die. - We know. And I don't want you to die as well. - That's all, sir. - Thank you. - We won't let you down. - I've done my job. Thank you, Mohammed. You're still my second favorite Mohammed. Guy hates dick jokes. - Yeah. - Think he's you serious? I think he'll be serious when he's the one that's running and hiding. Yeah. I wouldn't trade this for anything. That right, private? You'd rather hump gear or a couple of porn stars? I'd rather hump gear. Well, shit, Yunger. Thank you for your service. Thank you for your service! It's worth it for the brotherhood, man. Look at us, band of brothers! Like me and Sergeant Martin. We can just say anything to one another, and we're still tight as fuck, man, and always will be after this, right? Shit, he can call me a white trash motherfucker, - and I could call him a nigger, and it doesn't even matter. - Wait, what? What the fuck you just say to me? You can call me what? Yo, Yunger, you about to get your ass whooped. You Whiskey Tango cousin fucker you. - Chill, man. - Go ahead, say that shit again, man. - I'll slap your fucking nose off. - All right, knock it off! You got my blessing to kick his Whiskey Tango ass when we get back. You're a dead man, Yunger. What are they saying? Can't even make out this dialect. I think they're talking about scarves. You don't... You don't speak the goddamn dialect? All right, secure the far side. Sir, let us. Carter. Carter, come here. Kirk, you go. - You got it. - Yunger, on me. Welcome to Denny's. I'll be your server, Carter. Don't mind the Goth makeup. I just hate myself. Well, okay, rock star, I'll have a grand slam then. What? Carter, that was pretty good, man. - Okay, good to go! - No? Captain Yllescas, this bridge is for shit, sir. Embrace the suck, Yunger. Yes. Yes, sir. I got a question. Your old man in the military? Yes, sir, West Point, class of '84. - Really? - Yeah. You know a guy named Nick Coddington? Yeah, I think he did, actually. He's a fucking prick. - You like football, sir? - I do like football, yeah. - Thanks for asking. - Are you, uh, you a basket fan, right? - Yeah, yeah, yeah. - Yeah, I think they're gonna... We got someone down there. Goddamn it, man, where's that coming from? Get the fuck down now! Fuck! Goddamn it! Anyone got eyes? Thomson, call it in. I see movement, 11 o'clock. Norman, get your fucking ass down there and grab him. Yunger. Hey, you okay? Hey, man! ♪ Everybody cries ♪ ♪ Everybody dies ♪ ♪ Did you take the lonely path? ♪ ♪ Beneath the darkening sky ♪ ♪ We start to question why ♪ I think I had like, a piece of his brain in my mouth, man. - Blew him right up. - Oh, Yunger. Yunger, you okay? They just blew him up, Sergeant. Yeah. Yeah, I know. I was there. They just blew him up, man. I think I had like, a piece of his brain in my mouth. Yeah. Yeah, I know, man. That was, uh... - It was bad. - I'm a bad soldier, Sergeant. - You know, my dad was right. I don't think I can... - No, no, no, no. You're a good soldier. - You're a good soldier, Yunger. - Don't fucking bull... Don't bullshit me, man. I'm not bullshitting you, okay? I feel so fucked up, Sergeant, man. Sir, I feel so fucked up. I know. I know what you're going through, okay? The same thing happened to me in Iraq. I watched my best friend die. A fucking sniper. But, Yunger... Yunger, you listen to me. I got a wife and kids to come home to, and I made them promises. So I need you to make a choice. You gotta get your shit together, or we're gonna get you out of here. Sergeant. I'm fucking... fucking trying, man. - I just... - Listen to me. Sergeant! Get him to the aid station. We're gonna medevac him out. All right, guys, let's go. Yunger, it's time to go. We'll see you in a few months. Don't let him touch the ground! That's it? All on. HESCOS are pretty beat up. We got double-strand concertina wire and trip flares around the entire perimeter. We're thinking about making it triple-strand, sir. And given all the attacks here, sir I really think we should change our Claymore mines. As I understand it, they've been out there for over a year, - and are probably ineffective... - We'll get into all that later. How many ANA here? Uh, 80 on the payroll, when they all show up, which is never. We get 20 at a time, at best. Sort of what I thought. - This the TOC? - It is, sir. New orders have come down. We're closing this outpost come July. July, sir? July 6th. That's where I want you to concentrate all your efforts, - closing shop. - Yes, sir. Goodnight, gentlemen. I'll see you in the morning. - Good night, sir. - Good night, sir. July, huh? Good night. Sir. What is this? It's an Afghan voter ID card, sir. It was at the bridge where Captain Yllescas was targ... targeted. It most likely fell out of the prick's pocket that killed our captain. Tell him, Malak. I'm afraid it's true, sir. I, uh, remember this man. He was one of the workers at the hydroelectric plant. Somebody who we we're employing. We're not sure which village he's in. But I can saddle up the men, find him. Absolutely not. The squadron has appointed an investigating officer. We will wait on him to get here. Sir, by the time he gets here, that suspect will be gone. I am not gonna have you guys antagonize the population by rousing families in the villages. Colonel Spicer will have my ass. With all due respect, Captain Broward, I think the Colonel would appreciate it if... What the Colonel would appreciate is we do our jobs and properly, especially since we're outta here come July. The man killed our commander. I know. Justice will be served, Sergeant. Let's get this to the proper authorities. Sir. Okay? Okay, sir. Thank you. - Private. - Sir. Let's get this to the burn pit. Yes, sir. Aw, man. - Thank you, sir. - There you go. Have fun dreams. Take this. I don't want anybody getting malaria and spitting blood and shit. - Hey, Scusa. - I finished. I finished my application. Application for what? This guy wants to be an officer. No, no. I wanna go to flight school. Flight school, Scusa? Shit, I wouldn't let you hand out peanuts on the Afghan Air, my friend. Thanks, Kirk. That's really nice of you. - Hey, hey, hey. - Goodbye, ladies. You're gonna be a good pilot and a good officer. Thanks, Sergeant. But I ain't calling you "sir" ever. Hey, it's all good, Sergeant. You can call me whatever you want. I'll think of something. I'm sure you will. Really? An officer and a pilot? - Yeah. - Good luck with those goggles. What's up, guys? - Morning, Sergeant. - Morning, Sergeant. - How you hanging? - Not too bad. Scusa stole my fucking cheese tortellini. Now I got Asian beef strips. Hey, my one-year-old loves 'em? Let me see those. I'll show you what you do with this Asian beef dicks. .Come here. Come here, Franklin. Come on, buddy. Hey, see? Even the dogs don't eat this shit. Don't abuse my dog, Sergeant. - Shit! Shit! - Recon, Sergeant! - Scusa! - Yes. - Pre-fire! - Yes, Sergeant! Six, Red 2, taking sniper fire at LRAS 2, over. We have movement at the treetop. Requesting fire mission CRP Bravo 5. This is Six. Can you positively identify target? We have movement at the tree farm. Our mortars are laid on, sir. Do you have PID? Captain Broward, our mortars are laid on. We have dudes who we're getting sniped from. It's fucking obvious where we're being shot from. Over. Do you have PID? Do you see a weapon? Fucking PID. - Scusa! - Yeah. We have PID? Uh, I see... - I see movement! - Great. We have PID, sir. Clear to engage. Fuck you. Tree farm! One round! Thomson, pack of smokes says you miss! Now you know I love a smoke! Rules of engagement are different here. You cannot shoot someone for acting suspicious. Suspicious? So where were the bullets coming from, sir? You must PID a weapon or a radio in an enemy's hand. That comes straight from McChrystal. You want your next tour to be in Leavenworth? Well, someone should tell McChrystal that we're not out here selling popsicles, sir. Excessive force alienates the locals and causes greater risk. You better grass that fucking sentiment now. Furthermore, who knows when we'll be resupplied? And we can't waste ammo. And one more thing, Sergeant. You ever speak to me like that again, I'll send you to squadron. You wanna be a staff bitch and leave your men? No, sir. President Karzai doesn't want American forces to leave before the Afghan election. General McChrystal agrees. You need to let the men know. So we're not closing the outpost in July? - That's correct. - Got it. I'm sorry. Maybe October. The good news is, you'll all receive an extra $1,000 a month. That's all. - Thanks, Bundy. - Let's go. - Afternoon, sir. - Sir. Let's get these to the burn pit. Where do you want these? Set them right there on the desk. Let's get them to the burn pit. You got it, sir. Fucking unbelievable. You got another picture from home, I see. Yeah, check out these. You are a man obsessed, I swear. Mmm-hmm. Who wouldn't be? You are a lucky guy, but I don't know if it's healthy to, uh, dwell on her out here. At least on guard and all, you know? Yeah, I know, I just... I keep thinking about where the big one's gonna come from. Hey, fuck it. If they come, they come. This is our reality now. - I know, I know. - Okay? Focus. Only thing that keeps running through my head is how ungrateful I was when I was at home. Look, man, we're gonna get out of here and see our friends, our families, our loved ones, Sophie. We're gonna have a chance to make things right. - Yeah. - Okay? - Yeah. - That's where I need you at right now. Okay. Okay. Hey, you know what I'm gonna do when I get back home? Tell me. - I'm gonna take her in her room. - Yeah. - Yeah, gonna hug her. - Mmm-hmm. - Gonna hold her. - Mmm-hmm. - And let her kiss me all over. - Yeah. Never gonna let her go. - Yeah, that's one lucky girl. - Mmm-hmm. - Belly rubs for days. - Yeah. - Sir. - What's up, Carter? Can I speak to you under the commander's open door policy? Yeah, What's going on? Everyone's worried about the new CO. Okay, how so? He doesn't know what he's doing. He's scared. It's obvious. He doesn't leave the TOC except to take a shit. Even then, he does it with an escort. I carry his piss every other day to the burn pit. The men call him Broward the Coward. Carter, take a seat. Take a seat, Carter. Come on. You ever heard of, uh, Captain Bostick or Colonel Fenty? No, sir. They're two commanders who lost their lives in this shithole before Keating and Yllescas. Okay. This commander is a 37-year-old captain, who has seen a whole lot of death in Iraq before he got here. And he's probably seen more firefights than you've seen in the movies. And despite all that, despite the shitty odds stacked against him, he's here anyway. People much smarter than you or I put him here, and that's it. We will all do as he fucking says, Carter. Yes, sir. And, Carter... I better never, ever, ever hear that fucking nickname again, from you or anybody else. Good to go? Yes, sir. Thank you. You awake, Carter? Yeah, I'm awake, Sergeant. Good. 'Cause I don't exactly feel like lugging my ass out there to check on you. Well, all, all good out here. Just because I'm not watching, doesn't mean God isn't. You know, Jesus was a pacifist, Sergeant. I joined... volunteered for a war. You understand? I think that, uh... I think that tells you where, where God and I stand. You read the Bible, Carter? Violent as hell. Full of stories about Christians using force for good. Yeah, I've read it. Muslims think they're good, using force for good, too. Well, we can't both be right. We can both be wrong. Keep your ass awake. Out. Yeah, fuck you. I see movement, but I don't see a weapon. Maybe it's a spotter. Shit, shit, shit! Fuck! Well, that one was closer! Yeah, 150 meters. They're walking them in. I can't believe these fuckers have mortars now. - Son of a bitch! - Shots fired. Yankee, Foxtrot, 15627. Sir, those grid coordinates are 40 miles away. You mean Yankee, Echo? - Yeah, shit. - Yankee, Echo. Now he's fucking spooked. He's calling the wrong fucking coordinates! 15627890. Let's get some Willie Pete on their asses. They were walking mortars in and at night. Which means they have night vision now, sir. Has this ever happened before? No, sir. Well, where'd they get 'em from? Fucking ANA? I don't know, but we'll get accountability, sir. Captain Broward. Captain. Okay, make sure that happens. - You got it, sir. - What is it, Specialist? There's a situation at the ANA gate, sir. What's the situation? There's elders from the village. Fuck. You killed his daughter, Captain, with white phosphorous in the mortar attack last night. If his daughter is dead, then you have my sincerest condolences. No "if," sir. Sir, this isn't our job, This girl's been dead for days. This is what Americans bring. This is the death you bring. No, this is Taliban. This isn't us. The American government will pay a condolence fee of 3,500 once... - Sir, permission to speak. - Speak, Sergeant. They killed this girl, sir. And now they're fucking cashing in, sir. I understand, Sergeant. Let me handle this. Everybody knows you are leaving soon. If we do not get paid now, we will never get paid. Why do you say, we're leaving? We're not leaving. - Why does he say we're leaving? - No idea, sir. He claims the dog bit him, sir. Get this man to our medic. We'll take care of him. It's not so simple. To be bitten by a dog is extremely shameful in our culture. They expect retribution. They want retribution, sir. This is fucking bullshit. Fuck! What the fuck? It'd be great if we could all hang out, just playing with dogs, Witness Specialist Scusa, but we're soldiers in Afghanistan. We're not in a fucking dog park. Pay this man from the commander's discretionary fund. 1,000, 2,000, 3,000, 4,000, 5,000, 6,000! I don't care what anyone fucking says, man, that shit's torture. Fuck that. Broward should have a go. I lasted 10 seconds. A year ago in Iraq. Boosting morale? Trying, sir. I've been relieved of duty, gentlemen. A bird's gonna get me out of here in a day or two. Captain Stoney Portis is gonna take over in a couple of weeks. And the sorties to close down Combat Outpost Keating October 6th. You're in charge until then, Lieutenant. Sir. Gentlemen. - Sir. - Sir. - Sir. - Sir. Stoney Portis is bad ass, man. Dude's legit. Didn't you fuckers hear him? - What? - We're going home. Just when I was starting to have some fucking fun, right? I mean, we've heard this shit before, right? Yeah, they wouldn't have scheduled the birds, man, if... if it wasn't happening for real. He's right. - That's a good point. - Yeah. The Taliban cannot fucking find out about this. All right? None of this gets talked about in Skype, radio, e-mails, nothing. - Check? - Check. They ain't getting the drop on us, LT. Because, guys, our mission from now on is what it's always been. Yeah. To survive. Hey, hey, can you hear me? You think I don't like being there with him? He's growing up without me. Just... You know this is how it goes. Remember, it's all good. You know I love you. Okay. If it's getting that bad for you, I'll get out, okay? I'll finish this deployment, and we'll start a family. I gotta go now, baby. I love you. All right, keep me in your prayers, okay? And tell Dad to stop being a wise ass. Okay, God bless, Mama. Love to you and Dad, all right? I poured the whole thing on his head. Yeah, I know. Oh, yeah, no, it was fine. He didn't really... All right, uh, I gotta go, Mom. I love you, too. Brittany, is that my son? Put him on the phone. Hazim, hey, man! I'm just working on my fucking tan. I'm not fucking cussing. I love you, Blue Eyes. Bye. Yeah, yeah, eating enough. Love you, Gam-Gam. Trust me, babe, I quit. I wouldn't touch those things. Uh, me too. Me too. ♪ Six, seven, eight, nine, ten ♪ ♪ I put that fish right back again ♪ I have to go, sweetheart, and you have to get to bed. Oh, fuck it. Okay, on the news... When you watch the news on TV, you see bad guys doing bad things to good people like you and mommy? It's my job to take care of the bad guys, to find them and to kill them, sweetie. Okay, Miller, go get some sleep, man. Hey, Gallegos. Walked around this whole base like a half hour ago. Uh... Fresh batteries. Everyone's fucking good, man. Get some rack, man. Rack out. Mace, relief, buddy, just as soon as I am, all right? Morning, Sergeant. Hey, Sergeant. - Yeah. - If you had to fuck one guy, gun to your head, who would it be? No gun necessary. Chuck Norris. I always thought a beard would feel nice. Yeah, seems excessive. Hundreds are coming on us! They... The Taliban... The villagers are all gone. The Talibans are here! The villagers are all gone. The Talibans are here! Hundreds are coming on us! Hundreds are coming on us! That's what she said. Seriously, he fucking said that before. Last week, twice. - I know. - Guy needs a new catchphrase. Fuck me. Just another fucking day in Afghanistan. Bro, that incoming or outgoing? Outgoing? Nope, incoming. Hey, get up! All right, boys, we got contact. Everybody get up, now! Fucking here too. Jesus Christ. Fuck! Wong, what do we got? Sir, guard post reporting heavy contact. From where? Switchbacks, north face, fucking everywhere. Why aren't our fucking mortars up, Wong? Why aren't our fucking mortars up?

LRAS, move your ass. I'm heading to ECP. No fucking around. - ECP, Good, good. - I'm sending your ass to the shura buildings. We fucked up there. Why you sending me, Ro? You ready? This is the big one. Saddle up! Easy there, mate. It's gonna be a long fucking day. Look at these Afghan cowards! We gotta get to Larson. We gotta get to LRAS soon, man. - All right. - On me. Let's do it. Fuck! Friendlies, friendlies, friendlies! I'm coming, Thomson. Fuck! Friendlies coming in. Here to save your ass, Larson! Olive Garden! Move further to the left, further to the left! - On target, keep engaging, keep engaging! - Tell me what I am looking at! - Need any help? - Keep it. No, we're gonna need fucking ammo. RPG raw, Hector 100... Stand-to One, I'm fucking black on ammo. Fucking black on .50 cal. Get out of the fucking way! Fucker! Get up, Carter. Get the fuck up! Let's go!

We're out of ammunition. We need air support. Get your shit together, and get your men to fucking fight. We gotta free up our mortars, or none of us are getting out of here fucking alive.

Open the fucking door, Mace. Get it open. Get the fuck in here, bro. - I have the 240. - 240's fucking down, bro.

Let him in, Carter. - Who's that? - Oh, shit, I heard you needed ammo! - Come on, get in. - Get in, get in! Hurry up! Let him in here! Oh, fuck! Nice of you to join the party, Martin. - You must like this. It's like Cinco de Mayo. - RPG! Oh, fuck! Gallegos, how you holding up over there? Ro? I don't know, man. We got a shitload of gunfire from the fucking south, man. Well, other than that, you're fine, right? Yeah, I guess. Look, I got a machine gun set up. You think you guys can make it back to the barracks? I don't know if you can lay down enough fucking fire, but go for it. Over. All right. Be ready. Gregory, you ready? - Good to go! - Good. Help!

The only way we're getting those guys out there... - Hey, Ro. - We're gonna lose another vehicle. - Ro, hear me out here, man. - What? LRAS 2 is stranded, okay? They are inoperable. I'm taking Truck I. - I'm going with Faulkner. - I'm going, too. - We're gonna get those guys out of here. - Yo, yo, yo, Ro. Listen, Ro, we gotta get this arm checked out. I'm fine, I'm fine. I just came from there. - It's a cluster fuck. - What, you wanna bleed out? Listen, Gallegos is telling everybody to stay back - for a fucking reason. - Fuck that, man. Dead bodies attract more dead bodies. We have two KIAs already, okay? And we got Kirk in the fucking aid station, man. Kirk's in the fucking aid station. - Kirk? - Yeah, fucking Kirk, Sergeant. Okay, okay. Check this. You do this, you do it smart, okay? Fine. Use that maintenance shed for cover. You don't go up the middle. No, that's too far out of the way, man. Don't rush for failure. Fine, okay, come on. Let's go, Griffin. Don't worry about that. Just set it, set it, splint it, move on, okay? I tried everything, man. Six, this is LRAS 1, I got a fucking sniper over here. I need your sniper rifle! Where's that ammo? Koppes! Koppes, you okay? Where's that sniper? He's behind me. Same guy who killed Scusa. - Fuck. - Allahu Akbar! Shit. 12 o clock up on the treetops! LRAS 1, do you copy? LRAS 1, come in! Man, come here. Oh, where... Keep doing what you're doing. - I'm up the ECP. - I got you. Sir, I hear them fucking laughing, right outside... Hey, hey, Claymores. Roger. Fucking Claymores aren't working. Goddamned fucking Broward. Hey, hey. We may die today, but let's kill as many of these motherfuckers as we can, all right? Roger that. Frag these dudes, frag these dudes. Roger. Smoke 'em for three. One one-thousand, two one-thousand, three. Eat shit, motherfucker! Go, go, go! - Friendlies! Friendlies! - Friendlies, hold! Fuck! Find cover! You got ammo? - Yeah, man. - What are we doing, Sergeant? You're gonna drive us over to LRAS 2, and we're gonna get those guys the fuck out of there. Sergeant, fucking that we are. Quick, get up in the turret. Close that fucking door. Oh, shit! Motherfucker. Ammo. Gallegos, this is Hardt. We're driving to you now. Stay put. We're gonna get you out of there. Do not drive that fucking truck over here, Hardt. Do you hear me? Keep fucking pushing! Hardt. Are you good? Are you good? Look at me. Griff, get down! Fuck, fuck. You good? - Can you drive? - Yeah. Okay, okay, let's go. We gotta get over there. - You good? - Yes. We're fucking stuck. I think we're on a bump. Fuck! Hardt? - Hardt, are you good? - Fuck. Gallegos, I'm sorry. Fucking hell, Gallegos. I'm sorry we couldn't help. Fuck, I'm sorry. Fuck! I fucking told you, man! Will you please get the fuck out of here, man? Hang in there. Sergeant, those ANA don't look good. - What? - I think we got people in the fucking wire, man. Jesus. Those fucking Taliban. Those fucking Taliban, let's fucking kill those fuckers. All right, all right, all right. Look at me. This is what we're gonna do. You two are gonna make a run for it. You're gonna run like fucking hell. I'm gonna get in this turret, and I'm gonna cover fire you. - Yes. - Okay. Yes, Sergeant! - I'll see you soon, guys. - Fucking go. - Let's go! Fuck, yeah! - Fuck yeah! Fuck! Allahu Akbar! Lakis, on me! Friendly, friendly, friendly! - Whoa, shit. - Sergeant. - Fuck! - Charlie in the wire, Charlie in the wire! - Who's Charlie? - Fucking enemy, enemy in the wire! Holy fuck. They've got an RPG pointed right at me. Hardt? Hardt? Sarge, Griffin's dead, too. These your ANA? Not mine. These cocksuckers think they already won. Hit 'em with the 203. This is X-ray. Enemy in the wire, enemy in the wire. - Everybody fall back. - You see? They're fucking everywhere. Sergeant, what the fuck do we do? Enemy in the wire, enemy in the wire. Everyone into Alamo position. No, not today. - Romesha. - Sergeant! This is Black Knight VI. Quick reaction force has landed on the mountain. We will be there as soon as we can. Out. Roger, Captain Portis. We're gonna hang onto what we can. But it'd be really fucking nice to see you, sir. Over. Guidons, guidons, guidons. Alamo, Alamo, Alamo. - Collapse to the core. - Fuck that. We need to retake this camp. We don't have any mortars, air support, the manpower. We don't have any accountability. LT's right, Ro. We need to dig in, hold on to what we can, - and wait for support. - Stop. Helicopters alone won't save us. Our ammo depot is 40 yards away. It has everything we need to stay in this fight. We start there, and we plug our leaks. Take back our front gate, where the enemy is just walking the fuck in. And you get a machine gun on that dining hall. Everybody good? - We lost power! - Everybody good? Hey, you good? - LT. - Are the radios up? LT, our men are trapped out here. Let me do this, sir. You're sure you can make it happen? Yes. All right, if we're gonna do this, we gotta call a net switch. We got enemy in the wire. They probably got one of our radios. The men out there that are trapped, they're gonna be cut off, but we gotta do it. All right? - Check? - Check. Ro, wait for Hill's machine gun, all right? Check. X-ray, X-ray, do you copy? Motherfucking cocksucker! What? We lost comms, boys. What's the plan, G? - Gallegos, what are we doing, Sergeant? - Okay, here's what we do. We take cover at the rocks. We go to latrines. We'll pass latrines, past the laundry trailers, and then we haul ass to the TOC. I'll hang back and provide cover. It's gonna take a long fucking time. - I'll cover with you. - Everybody in? It's not up to us, man. You're senior. It's on you. It's your decision. Mace, keep the fuck up. - Martin, you're gonna okay. - Let's do it. Come on, bitch. - Carter! - Is everybody fucking in? We're going first, Carter. - I love you, faggots. Let's go. - Larson, Carter, you're out first. - On my fire! - Let's fucking move it. Go! RPG! You guys okay? Go, I got you covered! Go! Get out of here! Get up. - Mace is hurt, guys. - We're on you, we're on you. - Come on! - Fast. Cover me! Carter, cover me! Shit, these motherfuckers! Go! Quit dragging your ass, shit! Come on, man. We're nearly there. Gallegos! I'm good. Motherfuckers! Gallegos is down! How bad is it? Hey, watch your six! Coming to you! Carter! Carter, get in the truck! What the fuck happened to Mace and Martin? Fuck! What happened to Mace and Martin? I don't know! Hey, Red Platoon, I need volunteers. We're taking this bitch back. Hell yeah, Ro. Count me in. - You got me? - Good. Gregory? I don't think I can make it, Ro. - I've got his gun. - Jones, good man. Miller, Dannelley, let's go. Motherfuck... Ow, mother... Shit. Red II, X-ray, where the fuck's that machine gun? The machine gun is on its way. Just hang on. Shit. Shit. X-ray, we gotta move. We gotta get to the front gate now. They're right on top of us. Negative, Red II. Hold your position. Wait for cover fire. Sorry, what was that? You're coming in broken. Goddamn it, Ro. No. Oh, fuck. All right, guys. Let's go. I've never killed anyone before. Me too. - You got any smokes in that? - What? A pack of cigarettes. Wouldn't you be lucky? - Fuck. Mace. - Help! Mace, he's crawling to us. - Help me, please. - Shit, it's Mace! He's crawling to us. Mace is calling at us! Tell him to get behind that fucking rock for cover. - Mace! - Behind the rock! Get the rock... Get cover behind the rock! We'll come after you in a second! Fuck! He's okay, man. He has cover. He's fucking bleeding. He's fucking bleeding out. Carter, he has cover. - Carter, what are you doing? - Take cover. - I'm going out there. - Carter, what the fuck are you doing? Carter! - What are you fucking doing, man? - What the fuck? What do you mean, what the fuck am I doing? He's bleeding out! Dude, he has fucking cover there. We have cover here. There are only two of us! You wanna fucking die trying to save him? Mace, wait, Mace, wait! Jones, Dannelley, Lakis, ammo. Ras. Hey, 203! Dannelley, blind spot! You okay? Aid station, go! Ras, let's get these fuckers! Go. You keep that gun up until we get the front gate, okay? We take back the front gate, we take back this outpost. Love the pressure, Ro. This net, any station, this net, this is Red Dragon over. I got half a mag left. You? Take some of mine. Fuck. Any station this net, any station this net, this is Red Dragon, over. Think there's any one of us alive? Think we're it, huh? I don't know, man. Fuck this! I can get to him. Larson, I can fucking get to him. - He's right fucking there. - Dead bodies attract dead bodies, all right? I don't want you trying to win a fucking medal. Hey, Mace, stay right there, don't fucking move! We're coming as soon as we can! Fuck, fuck. Sergeant, Sergeant, Sergeant. - Carter, please. - Sergeant. God, stop talking. Stop. What are you gonna do when you get to him? I'm gonna render him fucking aid, man. Where are you gonna take him? His best chance is in here with us. - I agree. I agree. - Agreed? So? I'll cover you, okay? - Thank you. - All right? - Thank you. - Take a fucking breath. All right? Conserve your fucking ammo. Are you ready? - Let's go. - Let's go. You all right, Mace? My ankle is fucked up. It's okay. - Carter, is he alive? - Oh, baby, you're looking good. Fuck you, gay motherfucker. All right, man, just as soon as I can find it. - Hang with me. - Bunch of fucking... Hang with me. Ah, this is nothing, man. Where's your nuts, motherfucker? I know. I know, baby. Here we go. Come on, you a man or not? Huh? You got it. There you go. There you go, brother. I know! I think Sergeant Gallegos is dead. Fuck. Hey, but you're not gonna die, okay? - You stay with me, okay? - I'm gonna fucking die, Carter. No, you're not. No, you're not, fucker. You're dying of cancer, remember? You're dying of fucking cancer. Now, come on. Put your arms around me. - Put your arms... - Give me a fucking sec! Put your arms around me! Just like we're dancing. Carter, is he okay? Fat hobbit fuck. Find yourself a fucking parade. - Larson! - Put him in the front! Get in the truck. I'll cover you! Thanks! - Get in the truck! - Fuck me. Mace! Mace! Mace! - Mace! - You guys got a cigarette? Ras, 203. Stop, Ras. Allahu Akbar! Friendly, friendly, friendly. Geez, Ras, hit him with a CS grenade? No, high explosive, standard. Shit. Get the fire extinguisher. Good shot. Go. ECP clear. Take the guards out. Go. Just a little air support now, boys. X-ray, we're at the front gate. No one's getting in here. Oh, shit. Oh. Oh, come on, come on. Oh, shit. There's too many. God help us all. X-ray, target destroyed. Thank you for your service, ma'am. There's more where that came from. Hey. He's not gonna make it. Yeah, I know. So I'm gonna go on recon. If I'm not back in 10 minutes, then I made it or don't worry about me. Eyes open. You got me? Hm, yeah. fuck. Fuck. Yo, Mace. No, fucking what? - Gun to your head. - Gun to my head? Gun to your head, a guy you gotta fuck. Who is it? Gun to your head. - Oh, fuck. - Which guy? Fucking, uh... This is Blue Four Golf. Is anyone still alive? Request permission to engage up ahead. Keep your eyes open, Mace. Keep them open. Mace, look, look. Carter. American voices. I heard American voices! Get in here, get in here, get in here! You hear that, Mace? X-ray, X-ray, this is Red Dragon, over. This is the high point right there. Red Dragon, go ahead. What's going on? We're still trapped in LRAS 2. Gallegos is KIA. Hardt's missing. Carter and I are okay. - Okay? - And Mace is pretty jacked up. - You look me in the fucking eye. - He's hurting surgical. He's gonna need to get the aid station as soon as possible. We need some serious covering fire, over. Glad to hear you boys are still breathing. I'm gonna wrangle you some cover. We got a B1 bomber coming in from Qatar. When it drops its payload, it's gonna be a son of a bitch. When it hits, I need every weapon we have on camp. LRAS 2, that ought to be enough cover for you guys to make a run for it, over. This is Red Dragon. Wilco. Bombs away, all nets acknowledge. 30 seconds. Let these fuckers go. Hey, stay put. 171, this is X-ray. Emergency mission on my graphics, over. Drop everything you can on the switchbacks. X-ray, I copy. Get your boys down. We're gonna get close. - Carter, good luck, man. - Five, four... - Mace, stay with us. - ...three... ...two, one. You're gonna be all right. - Go, go, go! - Let's go! Hang the fuck on, Mace! We're hauling fucking ass! Whoa! There's Griffin! Come on! Move! Come on! You got it, Carter. Keep going. We're coming in! We got Mace! We're coming in! Make way! Make way! Carter, let go. Let go, Carter. Carter! Let go, Carter! Stay with us. I put the tourniquet on 15 minutes ago. He's... He's been bleeding... 15 minutes. 45. He's been bleeding out for 45 minutes. Come on, Mace, hang in there. Hang in there, Mace! Fuck yeah, you beautiful fuckers! Bird is coming in! Larson! Damn glad to see you. - Yellow. - I love you, too, man. Activity on the North face. Hardt and Martin are missing. Griffin and Gallegos are KIA. Hey, you know where they are? Got a stent in your carotid artery. His body's sending all his blood to his vital organs. - That's good. - No, no, no, stay with me. Hey, Cordova, that's good, right? No, it's not. His blood pressure's too weak. If he doesn't get out of this valley in the next hour, he won't make it. And there's no birds getting in here till after nightfall. It's time to get radical. As you can hear, air support is out there, doing the Lord's fucking work, right? Captain Portis and the quick reaction force is on their way. We're almost done, guys. Jesus Christ. X-ray, this is Black Knights VI with the QRF. Got eyes on the COP, over. Roger that, sir. We'll see you soon. Bone One Eight, you have eyes on my position? I copy. I think I see the last of 'em. 500 meters north, 50 degrees. Let's end this thing. Roger that. Glad they're on our side. A+ve. I'm A+ve. I'm A+ve. Hey, Doc. What Does that mean? What's going on? We can't perform surgery on him here. And what the fuck does that mean? Medevac won't be here for a few hours, which means he needs fresh blood if he wants to live. This is the only thing we can do. We're not sterile, and we can't test for disease. - Okay. - Our fresh blood is all we can do to save him. - Fuck. - Come on. Hey, Mace. - Mace, come on. Stick with me. - You'll be good, buddy. You might be a little light in the loafers, because it's fucking officer blood, but... All right, I need you to put a call in on the radio. Everybody with A+ve blood needs to get their ass to the aid station, okay? We need as much fucking blood as we can get. Fuck, Mohammed. Get out of there. Go on. I told you the Taliban would attack. - I know my country. - All right, go, go, go. Heard on the radio you guys need blood. Yeah, we need a second bag. You A+ve? - A-fucking-positive. - All right, give me this. All right. - You all right, Mace? - Stay with me, buddy. You all right, Mace? - We're gonna get you medevac soon, Mace. - How's he doing? We fucking won, man. We fucking won. We'll get you back home to Amanda and Mac, man. Come on, you're good. Come on, motherfucker. Let's go. Come on. You got him? - You got him? - Yeah. Come on, bro. Come on, bro. Come on, bro. You're good, man. I'm Lieutenant Bundermann. Captain Portis. Welcome to Outpost Keating, sir. All your men accounted for, Lieutenant? 27 wounded, seven dead, a dozen ANA severely wounded. Specialist Mace is pretty banged up. The medics are... They're optimistic, sir. He's got all of our blood in him. I'm sorry, sir. I know now's not the time. It is the time. Lieutenant, you did a hell of a job here. You took fucking command. What do you wanna salvage, sir? Nothing. Tomorrow, we blow this shithole off the face of the earth. That Hardt? Yes, Sergeant. Sergeant? Yeah, okay.

Faulkner, Ro, you guys are injured. I need you to get on that bird and leave tonight. I wanna leave with everybody else, sir, if that's okay. We're good, sir. Yo, run the line all the way. It won't fit on the truck, you put it where it'll burn. Yeah, roger. Mace didn't make it. What? Mace didn't make it! Hello? Hello? Hon, is... Is that you? I'm happy you came to talk. Well, Sergeant Hal said I had to. Well, you don't have to. - Only if you want to. - He said I needed to. Mm. You're very pretty. Thank you. So can you tell me what happened? What? When? During the battle. What... What about it? Do you remember what happened with you in the battle? Mm-hm. I didn't save... I didn't save him. Who? Mace. Mace, he was your friend. No. No, he was not. - I'm scared. - I know. It's scary, but I promise it will help to talk about it. I'm sorry. - It's okay. - Give me a sec. It's okay. Ty, can you breathe for me? In and out.

He went towards... towards Gallegos. And that's when I said, "Hey, Sergeant Larson, Mace is alive. "I can get to him. He's right there." And, uh, I think he looked, and he says, "No, you can't get to him." I say, "No, he's right there. I can get to him." And he says, "You're no good to him dead." And, uh... and I knew. I knew he was right, but it... It ate me up so bad. I need a break. Hold on. Yeah. Take as much time as you need. Finished out the belt and scurried on back, and I called Gallegos and told him... I told him I was sorry. Clint, you're one guy with no ammunition, facing 400 Taliban, all of whom have the high ground. You could always try, though. We'd landed, uh, at nighttime, but even at night, you could tell the silhouettes of the mountain and the sky were... Did not give us... It did not give you a very good sense of "this is a safe place." It gave me a quick sense of impending doom, that it was just a matter of time before a bad thing happens, and... And we're gonna... We'll be in trouble. I remember when I first landed at Keating. Um, I got off the helicopter. And when you got off the helicopter, you're supposed to take a knee, 'cause the propeller blades create such a prop blast that it, like, pushes you over. But I was just, like, staring with my mouth open, looking at the... At all... Like, the mountains, and just being in the valley, and it was so strange. I remember being down in the middle of it, and just looking up, and up, and up. And finally, I could see, like, the top of... Of the... The switchbacks. And it was just like that all the way around. Being able to play myself is... Is unique. You know, it's a very... I don't know if that happens very often in this industry. But as we were saying, just the realness of here, it's put me back into that mindset, and I've tried to embrace that, you know, with the uniform and, you know, the names of all those soldiers that were lost, that are still walking around here, you know, doing their role. Um, I think it's special, you know. And to be able to play myself, I'm very grateful that I'm still alive. And it's almost an obligation, I feel, to bring authenticity to this film. At... At LRAS 2, five men gave their lives to save mine. They were either directly at that position or supporting it. And so when I wear the medal, I think about them. I also wear the memorial bracelet, and in fact, most people think of Memorial Day as a time to celebrate or... Or have hot dogs, but it's actually a very somber time, to where we recognize what a lot of men and women have died for. When I came in with the QRF down the switchbacks, it was nighttime, and you could see the flames against the canyon walls. Um, and in the flicker of the flames kind of dancing on the canyon walls behind it, and in the buildings over the course of that night, started... They were razed. I mean, they started falling to the ground. Yeah. And I remember as I... As I walked the outpost when the battle was over, and the buildings were literally falling to the ground, I would see, um, black spots on the ground that were dark as motor oil. And then the flame, the light of the flames from the buildings would kind of illuminate it, just enough for me to see that it was a very deep color of red, and that's when I realized, "Oh, this is where... This is where one of our soldiers died." It's a very hard terrain out in Nuristan. It's incredibly difficult to... To win a battle when you're in the low ground like that. It's... It's near impossible. I mean, the only reason it was possible for these guys was because of some very strong leadership, uh, at the camp itself, and because they had an immense amount of air support, um, once it finally came in. I want people to know about Stephan Mace. I want, you know, more people to know about Justin Gallegos and the six others who died that day. Vernon Martin, I knew him for... For about three or four years. Scusa, I knew him for about three or four years from our deployment to Iraq together. And so, I mean, these... They were incredible people, incredible humans. Uh, that... I think it's important for more people to know about these eight that sacrificed themselves and hopefully spark an interest in learning more about others that have sacrificed themselves for the greater good of the United States' security. In my own words, I would describe Combat Outpost Keating as a... I don't know. I read somewhere in the Bible, the gates of heaven and the gates of hell are in the same spot. So at the time of the firefight, this was the... The gates of hell. But watching men, you know, sacrifice themselves to protect each other, you can see the true form of what, uh, brotherhood and love is. And so therefore, it would be the gates of heaven as well. That's the best way I can describe it.
