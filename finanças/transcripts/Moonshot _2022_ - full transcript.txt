Okay, here we go. Hi, I'm Walt and this is my official application for the Kovi Industries Student Mars Program. Not that the last 36 applications weren't official, it's just this is my final one. because they are actually making me graduate after this semester, so... Okay. I was raised by a single mom. She had, like, 100 careers. We moved around like crazy, so I never really had a home base. But one time when I was, like, six, she took me to see this solar eclipse and from that moment on all I wanted to do was go to the Sun. And I know that you can't actually go to the Sun. My mom would try to tell me that, but I would just stare at it. Uh, and I was obsessed. Because there was more out there than the new town, or the new school which always felt like the same town and the same school and I think if I could've gotten the chance to just go up there and look back I would've seen... where I fit in, in this crazy universe. Exploration is the way that we discover where we truly belong and I just... I don't belong here. Which is all to say that I think I would be a perfect fit for the Geological Survey Team, or Propulsions Analysis Department. Botany and Terraformation Crew, Security Detail, Rover Repair. Look, if you need someone to make you coffees, I'm your guy. I am your guy. That's it. Um... Okay. Well, with any luck, the next time you see me uh, I will be on Mars. Let's face it. This planet isn't cutting it anymore. I'm self-made billionaire, Leon Kovi and I cannot wait to meet you on Mars. Walt! Oat milk latte. Light foam. Oat milk latte. Light foam. This obsession with Mars is borderline unhealthy and you are on the wrong side of that border. Exactly. Should I fire you, so you can go there? Let's do it, Walt. I'll fire you. It truly would be my pleasure. No, Gary. I love it here. Maybe tomorrow. - Oat milk latte? - Light... foam? - Gary? - Yes, Walt? Did she just smile at me? Honestly, I'd say she smiled past you. - Analysis. - There is a 52% chance of romantic interest. But a 48% chance she pities you due to your low status position as an assistant barista to a robot on a university campus. Shall I continue? I honestly feel like I'm gonna get accepted this time. You're projecting. So what? Leon Kovi was 25 when he became the very first man to set foot on Mars. And here we are, just settling for the same classes and jobs and parties that our parents went to, and their parents went to before them and their parents went to before them... So you're not coming to the party? - Of course, I'm coming to the party. - Great. Come on. - You're carrying the booze. - No, come on. - We're gonna forget about it and I'm gonna take it to work. - Walt, I'm gonna need you to keep the whole Walt-ing thing in check tonight. - "Walt-ing"? - Bummer monologues. - Leon Kovi hero worship. - It's not hero worship. - That came with the application packet. - Not the frame. Don't you wanna be part of something special? Walt. You're not special. I'm not special. Most people, not special. Listen, someday, you're gonna meet someone and make something special with them. Like a memory. Or a weird, well, baby thing. But until then, drink this and for the love of God do not bring up Mars. This place is nuts. Do you live here? Oh, no. Some trust fund girl. You know, when I was little, I had this fantasy that my mom... Ooh, let's not. Yeah. Bathroom? It's beautiful. Hi, Sophie. Okay, show me yours. Hi, Calvin. Hi, human Sophie. Nine months. Nine months until my parents' contract is up and we return to Earth. Nine more months without touching you. At least this way, you will know when I want to touch you and vice versa. Well, I hope touching me is a lot more fun than touching one of these. No, no, no, it is. The texture's for, like... Can you guys please stop talking about touching each other in here? - Hi, Brandon. - Hi, Sophie. Jan, can you get Brandon out of here? - Will you stop calling her Jan? It's "Mom." - Jan, get your idiot son out! Why would you grab my butt? Now the hole. Dude, way too much, dawg! Get out of here. - Is that on Mars? - Oh! What are you doing? Get out! Just looking for the bathroom. Who walks into bathrooms without knocking? Walt. Is this live? How did they solve for the time delay? It's called quantum splicing. Don't talk to him. I don't know this man. - Could we exchange emails or something? - No! Mine's just "Walt" five times at... I'm sorry. I can replace it. Unless it's expensive. - Get out. - Right now? Yes, right now! Sorry. Jules tricked me into throwing a party. - And yet you're in your room. - Uh, nope. It's not really a party. It's more of a soiree. Sophie, it's fine. I'm late for work. Love you. - Love you. - Love you, Mom. Go. Mingle. We'll be back soon. And in the meantime, it might be good for you to have some new experiences. Nothing's more overrated than new. There's a title for your thesis. Sophie, go. I'll make sure Calvin calls you tomorrow. - Night, Jan. - Goodnight. You know, I've been at this school for three years. Always said that I'd explore these woods. Never have. Guess I thought that I would just... I've been going to this school for five years. Oh, five years, okay. And I always said I'd explore these woods too. But know what? Somebody already did. A long, long time ago. It's over. There's nothing left to discover. You're okay, man. You're a good listener. I'm sorry. I've never seen light flirting take such a dark turn. Basically my superpower. Just one brief conversation with me will really leave you questioning everything. Not the hero we need, but maybe the one we deserve. You know, in about 14 seconds you're going to get the sudden urge to jump. Oh, no. You're safe. I'm already in the midst of an existential crisis. Oh, well. In that case, Walt, at your service. - Ginny. - Ginny? Yeah, the, uh, astrophysics major? How did you know that? I was in your Intro to Fluid Dynamics class. Freshmen year. This is the part where you at least pretend to remember me. - Oh, my God! Walt! Wow. - Yeah, thank you. Thank you. Changed your major? Sixteen times. Only for personal reasons like... I have no idea what physics is. But enough about me. Tell me about your crisis. What's going on? Well, I'm supposed to move tomorrow. Big move, actually in, uh, seven hours and... Let's just say it's a big commitment and I'm not a big commitment kinda gal. Are you saying we're in one of those classic "we-only- have-tonight" scenarios? Will spending it with you make me wanna stay? Now, the thing about here, is that it's mostly garbage. As you can see, to your left and to your right there's literal garbage overflowing from these receptacles at all times. - Yeah. - And it might magically seem to disappear but it's really just added to that big floating pile of garbage in the Pacific Ocean. Currently the size of Texas and visible from space. How scenic. Now, the one great thing about this particular garbage factory is its connection to the last best chance any of us have at a real adventure. The Kovi Industries Mars Program. So that's how they got you here. Yeah. But tomorrow another ship will leave for Mars without me. You could always rob a bank and buy a ticket. - Yeah, I'd have to rob, like, nine banks. - Hmm. I have considered the old air ducts plan. You know, hide in the air ducts survive on stolen food. Pee in bottles that you dump into other people's toilets while they sleep. And hope they would be so impressed when I arrive that they just let me stay. Curious how you spin garbage into this spot. This is a garbage-free zone. It's like Mars. Did you know that they send all of their trash back to Earth on the return flights? Okay, I gotta know. Why Mars? I feel like if I had been born like 600 years ago I would've stolen a boat and just set sail by now. And I probably would've died. Oh, definitely would've died. But it would've been an adventure. You know? And now there's Mars and I keep applying, but 36 rejections later and I'm starting to get the feeling that... They don't need extraordinary mediocrity? Yeah. That's funny. No, I get it. "Mars has been our mirror our foil. A telltale reflection of what has been deepest in our hearts. We've seen in Mars the utopia, a wilderness, a sanctuary. With so few landmarks, guideposts, or constraints all is possible. Mars has been a blank canvas and tenderly our human seeking has rushed to fill it." Did you come up with that? No. Oh. Sarah Stewart Johnson. Astronomer. - Smart. - Hmm. I think when you look at something from this distance, it's all possibility. Then every step you take toward that strips it away until it is what it is. And what it always has been. I'll miss you. - Walt, from Earth. - Okay. If you ever make it up there, give me a call. Up where? Mars. You convinced me. Wait. What? The application window for tomorrow's launch is closed. - Would you like to apply for next year's mission? - No. I need you to check an existing application. Applicant ID 781-2439. Thirty-seven applications found. Application one, rejected. - Application two, rejected. - Stop, stop. Please stop. Application 37 is pending review and I need you to approve it. I need to be on that ship tomorrow. To be with the girl of my dreams who has slowly stopped responding to my texts. My chance at a relationship is imploding like a dying star. - Do you understand? - I do, Walt. And I sincerely hope you can ask her out in 412 days, - after next year's mission. - Okay. Angie. Angie. I hate to say these words. I really do. - I need to speak with your supervisor. - Of course. - One moment. - Yes, Angie! I am Alan, Angie's supervisor. - Yes, Alan! Go, Alan! - Reviewing now. - Application rejected. - No! - Alan! - Commercial tickets are still available for the discounted price of $937,000. Wow, wow, wow! Who could afford that? - Greetings, Walt. - Sorry I'm late, Gary. Do not worry. I have already docked your pay. The lonely human at table 7B has not moved for five hours and 11 minutes. Shit. I know her. I broke her orb. Tell her to order a beverage or leave. Oh, come on, Gary. Oh, come on, Walt. Hey! You probably don't remember me. You broke my orb. Good memory. Is that supposed to make us even? No. But if you don't order anything, you can't use the Wi-Fi and sit here like a black hole of sadness. - Company policy. It is. - Stupid policy. And you're gonna have to pay for that. Because if I do, Gary will just ask you to leave. Are you serious? Rarely. But right now, yes. Yay. How's the Mars boyfriend? He's great. - Yeah, he got his Martian dream job, so... - Wow. ...one year of long distance just became indefinite. And then my Wi-Fi cut out. Probably because of all the calls with him trying to make it work. And now I'm sitting here, suffering in public and paying for drinks that I didn't order. So you tell Gary, I hope he gets malware. I hope she fails to find long-term companionship and learns the pain of a solitary life. I'm not paying for that one. Believe it or not, I might be the only person here who knows exactly what you're going through. Because you're causing it? No. Because my girlfriend left for Mars a month ago and hasn't texted me back in three days. How long have you guys been together? Since ninth grade. So, eight years. Eight years? - How did you manage that? - We had a plan. One year, long distance and then he comes back to Earth and I graduate and we use his terraforming expertise and my focus on eco reconstruction to jump-start an algae-based waste reduction technology. - What? - Plants that eat garbage, okay? It's how we're gonna save the world. - You're smart. - I know. And what about you guys? Ginny? We've been dating since freshman year-ish. It got serious recently. What does this Mars genius have that I don't? - Everything. Yeah. - Everything? Could you actually be more specific? I'm trying to figure out why they keep rejecting my applications. He checks all the boxes. Oh. You mean, literally. Okay, let's see. "Quiet. Strong jaw. Mental fortitude. Six-pack. Good family, cool mom." I have a cool mom. Yeah? You guys close? No. I mean "cool," like when she was going through the divorce I was able to just do whatever I wanted from 12 on. Anyhow. "Hates video games. Pragmatic and high-earning potential." - It's interesting. - What? That's an impossible checklist. - That's my cue. - You know, if you really love this guy I do know a way that you can get on that ship tomorrow. Two words. Air ducts. - Or I could just buy a ticket. - Yeah, for like a million dollars. Do you have a million dollars? - My finances are personal. - Oh, my God. Oh, my God. That means you have at least two million dollars. What are you doing here? Buy a ticket! - It's your last chance for a year. - I can't. You have the money. I have aerophobia. Well, we're all afraid of arrows. Oh, my God! I'm afraid of flying. - And now I'm trapped. - You're trapped? I'm trapped. - Gary, door! - I can't even get through security to see a shuttle launch up-close. - Unlock the door, Gary. - I'm afraid I can't do that. Perhaps it's malware. You can transcend time and space. In the name of love. The ultimate adventure. I'm filing a complaint to corporate right now. Open the door. No need to call corporate. A simple misunderstanding. Walk away. Just like I knew you would. - You don't know anything about me. - I know everything about you. No! The only people who know me are 55 million miles away! The only people who know me are 55 million miles away. The only people that know me are... Gary? Oh, God, that's sad. No, no. No. Please, please. Don't call corporate on Gary. He's just gonna take it out on me. Calvin is on Mars. Jan, Brandon, Jim, they're all there. How many boyfriends do you have? It's really that simple. Goodbye, Walt. Hey. I know I went radio silent for a hot minute, but I promise this will make up for it because... you just got the world's first interstellar cat video. This little genius snuck into one of our escape pods back on Earth. Now, she's gonna be the first cat on Mars. I named her Ripley. Say hi. This little genius snuck into one of our escape pods back on Earth. - ...into one of our escape pods back on Earth. - Oh, my God. Walt, I saw you consuming alcohol. I must administer a breathalyzer. - Breathe on my face. - Bye, Gary. - I'll miss you. - Goodbye, Walt. I have already forgotten you. Okay. You can do this. You're okay. I'm billionaire astronaut Leon Kovi and it's my pleasure to welcome you to the Kovi Industries International Spaceport. Together, we can build a better world on a different world. - Hey! - Oh, my God. What are you doing here? And what are you wearing? I just came to see the launch. And I got all this duty-free. Wore it right out of the store. Duty-free doesn't mean free. You just robbed a gift shop. What? No. Wait, really? Look, I just came to apologize. I was a dick. Also, I need a favor. You are the ingrown toenail of humanity. - Leave me alone. - Just hear me out for one minute. All I need is for you to tell security I'm your family - so I can accompany you to the gate. - What? No. God! I'm leaving this planet largely because of you. And I totally understand. Again, so, so sorry. - It's just... - It's just, "Go away." You had a plan, right? So you know what it feels like when that plan gets taken from you. How it just kills you? I barely got in this school. I took out 100 loans and I worked a dozen crappy jobs because this was my plan. To go to Mars. And now Ginny is there and I have to be with her. I have to adventure with her. Just like you. - Just like Kelvin. - Calvin. Just like Calvin. But now Ginny is gone. And all I have left is one last chance to see a rocket launch up close which I have dreamt about for as long as I can remember. Sophie... you can keep my dream alive, if only for a couple more hours. Please. Please help me. You are not allowed to talk. And on the first colonial mission the ship's hull was damaged. Kovi had to survive in the air ducts. Now, he almost died, but his lung capacity is unparalleled. My lung capacity is also kind of unparalleled. When I was a kid, I actually went under in the wave pool. I was down there for, like, three minutes before anyone could even pull me back up. They all thought I drowned, but I really just passed out. That's why I never go to the bathroom in the wave pool. Did you know that this whole building is triple-reinforced with concrete? Space concrete. In case the shuttle explodes on the launchpad. Which has only happened twice. - What's happening? - Shut up. It's something I have to do when I'm nervous. - I dance to relieve tension. - No, no, no. I'm into it. - Don't make fun of me. - I'm not. This is the first interesting thing I've seen you do. I hate when boys do that. As if they are the arbiters of all that is interesting. Final call for all zones. Final boarding call for all zones. - Okay. This is it. - This is it. Goodbye forever, Walt. - Well, maybe not forever. - Forever. Oh, I actually got you something. Don't worry, I paid for it this time. But Duty Free should really change its name. - Walt. - Right. Yeah. Thank you for everything. Also, makes us even for the orb. Sure. We're even. Last guest on. Locking up the gate. One Mississippi. Two Mississippi. Three Mississippi. Cosmic background temperature is currently minus 455 degrees Fahrenheit. Welcome to the Kovi Industries standard-issue escape pod. Our orbital shuttle will gently transfer you to the Olarun Four, our state-of-the-art cruiser, where you'll enjoy the journey to Mars in unparalleled comfort. And remember, once we take off, there is literally no turning back. ♪ Goodbye earthling Hope to see you soon ♪ ♪ We'll miss you lots We'll miss your thoughts But not your CO-2 ♪ Ten, nine, eight, seven, six, five, - four, three, two, one. - I am coming to Mars. Hey, that wasn't so bad, was it? Considering we all could have blown up. Just kidding. You're now docking with the Olarun Four where you'll enjoy complimentary gravity, a self-guided spacewalk. Welcome to the Olarun Four, your home for the next 35 days. I'm self-made billionaire Leon Kovi and I cannot wait to meet you on Mars. You did it! You're on the ship! - Yay, Sophie! - You made it! Calvin isn't worth it! Bye! I love you! Right this way. - Straight down the hallway. - I love you. Call me. Captain Tarter, you are needed on the flight deck. Although the computer is piloting the ship. - You. - I work here. Oh, thank God it's you. You asshole! - Wait, wait, wait. - You used me. No. A little. I can explain. I'm gonna hide in that air duct. You're never gonna see me again. Until you get caught. Or die. I'm not gonna get caught. - I already caught you. - Exactly. What are the chances that's gonna happen again? - You're so strong. - Shut up. They will run your information, they will link you to me. I brought you through security. - Aiding and abetting. - Yeah, but you didn't know. Best case scenario, they send us back in escape pods. No, I can't get back on one of those things. And you go to the jail for five to ten. I would be put on a no-fly list indefinitely. I can't see Calvin or any of them. For years, we'll... What are you doing? I'm texting Ginny. I broke your orb by accident. It is a closed network. You text Ginny, anyone, you... We get caught. Then let's get in the air ducts. Come with me. Hello, Sophie. Initiating ambient sound control. Hey. You cannot, under any circumstances, leave my room, okay? - What? - I will sneak you in food. There's a bathroom. It'll be like camping. Okay, clearly you've never gone camping before and I'm not going to spend my first trip to space on the toilet. Because you prefer the air ducts? Because what do you think happens when two people are trapped in the same room together? When two humans are confined for an extended period it results in either more humans, or fewer humans. - Who is that? - That's Cornelia. Complimentary AI for the journey. And I'm your captain, Tarter. Captain Tarter. Calvin. - I like your sauce. - It's Captain. The sauce is my father. What the fuck? I don't remember you from orientation. What happened? Did you have to come right back and just rip his jumpsuit off? - Yeah? - This is Sophie, my girlfriend. Long-term girlfriend. I don't believe it. I'm gonna have to rename this corridor Lovers' Lane. Tabby! Celeste! Come meet your new neighbors. Hello. I'm Tabby. - This is Celeste. - Hi. I'm Celeste. - Sophie. - Calvin. - I'm a scientist. - Engineer. - Double threat. - Enough shoptalk. Tabby and Celeste over here, or can I call you Taboo and Celery? They've been engaged for nine years. We are actually not engaged. Yet. It's just when we were talking earlier I was saying, "We'll probably get engaged once we get to Mars." - Congratulations? - You know, as captain, I could marry all of you guys. I mean, not like a four-way thing. - Two weddings. - We should do this. - No. - Full disclosure. I just need to have a party on this ship. Honestly. I can pilot a four-billion-dollar spaceship through an asteroid belt, but I can't get one of you guys to let loose. You know what I'm talking about? You don't. Well, it was nice to meet you. Yeah. Okay. All right, you guys. Just need to see your ID so I can check you in, and I'll be out of your love nest. I don't seem to have my ID on me. I don't wanna hold you up. I can run it by the bridge later. I knew it. You're the looks, she's the brains. Yeah. Listen, when you find it, just scan it on the wall and Cornelia will log you in. 'Kay? Awesome. Ooh, happy early birthday. How old is she gonna be? Trick question. You never say a woman's age. How old do I look? Trick question. A-hole. - It's your birthday? - In two weeks. - Listen, I gotta... - We should throw a party! I don't do birthdays. Jehovah's Witness? No. They're arbitrary, and we don't need any extra attention. Well, extra attention is kinda the point. Oh, no, I see what you mean. All onboard data flows through the manifest, which is controlled by the ship's log. So if anyone knows how to print you an ID, it's them. How do you know all this stuff? Do you think I would let the love of my life take one of these ships across the solar system without knowing exactly how it's made? Don't say that like it's normal. Hello? R-I-G... G? Huh. Says here you were already on the Olarun Two. Oh, there... Earl, this is a clerical error. You know how computers just get buggy sometimes? Why are you two standing so far apart? Most young couples are all over each other, kissing... at an alarming frequency. Yeah. That makes sense. Right, sweetie? Ah! Say, Earl... what's this? Space wine. Cool. I usually drink alone. I gave Carla a glass... but she can't hold her liquor. Carla? Oh. Carla, the computer. You can't hold your liquor. Uh... Earl... Oh! All right. Soft reboot, Earl. How do you know how to do all this? My thesis is on eliminating planned obsolescence and universal mechanical literacy as key tools to promote biospheric sustainability. It'd be kind of ironic if I didn't know how to fix it, you know? Yeah. Yeah, I know, I know. I do know... It's ironic. Earl, is that you? I had the most terrible dream. Let's get you that ID. Hello, Calvin. Hello, Calvin. Hello, Calvin. Your photo will show up in all the system reports so as long as no one does a deep search, you should be fine. Calvin hates social media. Okay. Amazing. Wow. My heart is racing. What are we doing next? Next? We lay low. What? No. Oh, my heart. - Gary? - Cornelia. Cornelia, is my heart normal? Your biorhythms are elevated. You may be experiencing cardiac arrest... or sexual reproduction. Oh, it's definitely not sexual reproduction. Okay. We need a routine. Be seen enough not to draw attention. Oh, here we go. A lecture series by a few of the Mars specialists on board. Hard pass. - Bathing in zero G... - Soft maybe. Food tube cooking, spacewalk... Spacewalk? No. You need a partner for that and there's no way I'm getting off the ship until it lands. Come on, Sophie. We are in the clear. Let's go have some fun. We're not gonna get caught. They're not gonna kick us off. Check it. Cornelia? Greetings, Calvin-Walt. Nope. Just Calvin. Cornelia, wasn't there a stowaway on the Olarun Three? Yes. A feline was discovered. And isn't that cat now the very first cat on Mars? - No. - See? What? She is awaiting trial for her crimes against the company. Ripley. And that's why we stick to the plan. - What's this? - Calvin's practice interviews. If you're going to be him, you have to get to know him. You filmed them? I will download his thesis for you and explain it to you, and show you some of the messages he sent me. The PG ones. You mean the boring ones. Cornelia, please dim the lights. This is gonna suck, isn't it? Only for 35 days. We can do quizzes at 7:00 a.m. and 8:00 p.m. - Two a day? - Yes! What about... personal intimacy time? We share that room. Exercise some self-control. Hey, there she is. - Sorry, do we have a call scheduled? - No, no, we didn't. I just thought that you might be in the mood. Got to shit. Wrong room! Wrong room! Whoa! Whoa! Hypocrite! Hypocrite! Hypocrite! Sophie! Sophie? - You get 10 minutes a day. - 15. - Twelve. - Fine. Humans. AI. A crucial relationship that should always remain professional. Even I struggle to follow. We would love it if you would do a lecture on terraforming. - No. - Since you are the expert. He had a traumatic accident on stage last year and he's recovering still. Did you get an erection? - What? - Yes. - Oh, my God. - Wow. - You have to keep a low profile. - I am. People wanna hang out with me even after the erection rumors. It's weird, I know. It's never happened to me before. It's because they wanna hang out with Calvin. Ginny doesn't care if I work out. She does. No, she doesn't. She does. Hey. No. Pick it up. Given my major in biochemical engineering and my parents' existing employment at Kovi Industries. Not that I should be hired... through nepotism or something like that. I just mean that maybe if I could... - Hey, relax. - I am relaxed. You're doing fine. Why don't you talk about how we use the same tech on Earth to aid in waste reduction... - Sophie. - ...develop new bioplastics, and innovate... - Sophie. - Please just focus on the camera. If I deviate too much, they'll just skip to the next applicant, okay? Sure. Rolling. Good night, sweet passengers. May your dreams be filled with the counting of electric sheep. Hey! You're coming to Mars? - And then you go radio silent? - Mother... - Hello, Sophie. - Privacy! Privacy! - Wait! Are you watching porn? - You're coming to Mars? - What? No! - Lights! Pause. Just pause. Play. Hi. You're coming to Mars? And then you go radio silent? I don't know if you're serious or not... - but call me. - You logged in? Are you kidding? I couldn't tell if Ginny was actually excited that I was coming to Mars. I'm just trying to get a more scientific answer. You're using facial recognition software to find out if your girlfriend likes you? Likelihood of romantic interest... - 82%. - Yeah! - Who was that? - I am Gary. That's Cornelia. I reprogrammed her name and voice to Gary. After Gary. You can't do that. I'm lonely. And you don't let me talk to anyone. No. You can't change things without telling me, okay? There's a plan and we stick to the plan. If we don't, we go to jail, or we get ejected into the sun. You can't just unilaterally change things because you're insecure about your relationship. Oh, I'm sorry. Are you talking to me or are you talking to Calvin right now? What's that supposed to mean? I didn't change your plans. Calvin did. I didn't ditch you to go to Mars for a job, Calvin did. I didn't refuse to send you nudes. Those texts were off-limits. I saw them by accident. Where are you going? I saw Earl eating ice cream, but they don't serve it in the cafeteria, which means he's got his own little supply that I'm gonna steal from because I am stressed. And when I'm stressed, I need sugar. No! I work here! Does that ever really work? Most of the time, yeah. We have to get out of here. We are going to get caught. You are the only person that ever catches me. Okay. Okay. If you're gonna be here, you gotta pull your weight. I know you're not used to this sort of sneaking around, espionage thing. I am. I'm the expert here, so I'm gonna be looking for the refrigeration unit. The cooling kind. Like that one? Okay. Come on. Guess this means I'm kinda grounded for the rest of the flight? - Kinda. - Copy that. And can you please keep your opinions about my relationship to yourself? You've no idea what we've been through. Hello, Sophie. You're right. Ambient sound control activated. Sorry. Okay. Apology accepted. You know, you're almost always right. Even in those last three arguments with Calvin. And I know I shouldn't have read them... but you were right. It's honestly creepy and kind of annoying how right you are all the time. Especially as someone who is wrong almost all the time. Never right. Well, except right now. Me saying that you're right... Okay. I got it. Thanks. Now, let's go. And you're totally right to lock me in here for the rest of the trip. But can we please start my house arrest tomorrow? Why? This is made out of algae? Smells like it. This is pretty bad. It's awful. Calvin would love it. Okay, that's... probably true. I don't know how he does it. Does what? Super focused, algae genius thing. Like it's all he thinks about. It's not all he thinks about. Okay, well... the great thing about being Walt, is that he's not smart enough to think about any one thing for too long. I miss Walt. Good guy. Handsome. So, what about you and Ginny? What about us? You're flying to Mars for her. You must have some sort of plan. I don't know. I steal the spaceship... travel the stars... adventure. What? You've been on a spaceship, traveling through the stars your entire life. Earth. In a billion years... we will never build or find anything quite like it. It's our only spaceship. What could we possibly do out here that we couldn't do there? You ever worry the wrong person is headed to the wrong planet? Me and Calvin? No. We'll be back. Once his contract is up... First his turn, then my turn. Right. The plan. We're building a life together. And when you find something extraordinary, you fight for it. Sacrifice for it. Protect it. Yes. Because what most of us fail to appreciate... when presented with something truly unique, is that it will only ever exist once. You read my thesis. I may have even understood it. That is weirdly touching. That algae really isn't sitting well. Don't mention algae. Hello, peers. Unfortunately, I've just learned that our scheduled speaker, Doctor Franklin Dearborn... has come down with a mild case of "space madness." - Awesome. - And his scheduled presentation on the theoretical limits of quantum propulsion is being rescheduled. However, I was logging on to one of the community terminals and I came across this fascinating thesis presentation. There it is. Calvin Riggins... - Oh, shit. - Oh, my God. ...is our very modest but very accomplished expert in terraformation. And I'm hoping he'll save the day by coming up here and teaching us a bit about how Mars will someday be as green as Earth. Hopefully, greener, as Earth is dying. Come on up here, Calvin. - What do I do? - I don't know. Maybe just riff. Isn't, like, talking your superpower? Calvin! One second. Calvin! Calvin! Calvin! Calvin! Give me one of your earbuds. We'll use it like a walkie-talkie. You can just tell me what to say. I left them in the room. Get up here! Have them eject me towards the sun. Calvin! All right, here he comes! He's coming up! Don't worry. If you get an erection, keep going. Uh, hi. I'm Calvin. I'm a terraformologist. Zinger! Let's start with the basics. Terraforming... which comes from the Latin term "Terra..." - Oh, God. - ...meaning "Earth..." and forming... That's forming. "Changing Mars for us." Changing for us. Changing... Someone a lot smarter than me once said that Mars is like our mirror. The reflection of what is deepest in our hearts. Calvin, that's so true. After traveling with you guys for the last few weeks, I don't really know if that's true anymore. When I look at you, I see the smartest people on the planet. And you've spent your entire lives trying to check an impossible set of boxes... for Mars. And I get it. Mars is awesome. I applied to this program, like, 37 times. But maybe when you find that thing that you're willing to cross the entire universe to be with... just make sure it's ready to do the same for you. Don't terraform yourself. It's your life, too. Thanks for listening! I'm done. That was it? A little short. Tabby... let's get married. What? I mean engaged to get married. Calvin's presentation, it was useless from a technical perspective... but he's right. I should have never put Mars before us. Before you. Oh, my God. Oh, my God. What say you, woman? Yes! Yes! Listen up, everybody. Mandatory engagement party in T-minus 30 minutes. It's finally happening! A real dance party! It's time to shine, bitch. Hey! Hey. Did you make this? I didn't pack a dress. You are so annoyingly good at things. Coming from a guy that just inspired an engagement party with a speech pulled from the deepest recesses of his own ass. Oh, this isn't an engagement party. What are you talking about? It's a birthday party. I don't do birthdays. You also don't fly on rockets or conspire with stowaways. I think you just gotta face it. You're a space criminal now. Now make a wish. And don't wish to go on a spacewalk with me because that's, kind of, an open-door policy. Any time. Any time. Please. Spacewalk. My wish. You got it. Do you wanna get your parents on a video call? My parents died when I was 14. What? I'm so sorry. I had no idea. Calvin's family took me in. Well, Jan, actually. She didn't even hesitate. It was just, "Here's your room." "What are your favorite meals?" and "I'm ready to go shopping whenever you are." You know, Calvin probably wouldn't go to a party like this. Okay. I'll go peacefully. Just let me have one more song. No, I mean... you should be Walt tonight. 'Cause you miss him so much. Come on, Tsukino. Yeah! - Oh, my God, it's our room. - Here we go. Ambient sound control activated. I should really go hang up this dress. Yeah, let's keep it on. Think of it like a really big bib. That space wine hits extra hard with this altitude. Oh, my God, Walt. We are in space, not high in the sky. Do you have any idea how space works? I'm sorry. Sometimes you're just so dumb and it makes me so angry. I know. Makes me angry too. Gary, can you please dim the lights? I feel like a Hot Pocket. Hey. What should we do for my birthday? Something old Sophie couldn't... but new Sophie can. I can't do this. You can totally do this. - We're gonna die. - Eventually. In glorious battle. - Let's go back inside. - No. Look at me. On three. What? What on three? You know what on three. Seriously? One. One. - Two. - Two. - Three. - Three. Whoa. Kovi Industries is not responsible for your actions on this spacewalk. Should your tether break, we must assume user error. Please launch yourselves onto the platform. Come on. Getting closer isn't gonna change the view. Getting closer always changes the view. No, no, no. Stay. You can do this. You can do this. He is no better than you. You're brave. You're strong. You can do this. Is it everything you imagined? No. Of course it's not. It's so much better. What the hell was that? I don't know. Please remain calm, human passengers as there is nothing you can do to increase your odds of survival. All right. Listen up, everybody. Roughly 11 minutes ago, our hull was breached by an unidentified piece of debris. Our O2 reserves have been pierced, so we'll be docking at the Mars orbital station, and we'll take a freight shuttle to the surface. Come with me. Hello, Sophie. They're checking IDs at the Mars database, which is basically space customs. So the moment they scan yours, they're gonna see that Calvin is already on Mars. Oh, shit. Question. Do you think you can fit in my suitcase? That feels like a first draft idea. Okay. Well, if you weren't so gangly then it might work. What if we say there are two Calvins? The one on Mars is already the imposter. I could sleep with Captain Tarter. I know that I'm her type. It's like a honeypot scheme. We know that she's indebted to me after that point, and not because I want to or anything, but because it, - you know, would help us... - Okay, stop. How do you feel about air ducts? O2 reserves dropping. Human passengers are advised to remain calm and breathe as little as possible. Sophie for Walt. Sophie for Walt. Do you read me? One hundred bucks says you just said that into your wrist. No. Liar. Shut up. You need to focus. At the next junction, turn left. Turning left. - Turned left. - Okay. This shaft connects to the orbital station. Take me to the what, Sophie? Do not, under any circumstances, go towards the turbine. - Sophie. - Walt. Walt. Walt? Passengers are advised to move to Sub-concourse A. Do not, under any circumstances... lose faith in yourself. Come on, Walt. This is a lot easier. Walt. Walt. Walt? Walt? Are you up there? Of course. You picked the wrong shaft. You idiot. You moron. Hey. I'm here. I'm here. Why wouldn't you say so? I thought you were gonna do the whole "She thought he was dead and then she revealed "that she actually thought he was a great guy" thing. You need to get upstairs with everyone else. I'm gonna be totally fine down here. It's pretty cramped up there, and they already checked my ID so... Is that a tent? Mmm-hmm. This feels wrong. Sophie. We're camping. Think of it like foraging. This is camping-adjacent at best. Come on. Use your imagination. Smells bad. It's uncomfortable. You can go to the bathroom anywhere you want. Just like camping. I think we need a view. Beginning orbital rotation. Estimated time to arrival, 14 hours. Where to go first? Wait. Lights. Good idea. Wow. Titan. Good choice. Try Europa. I feel like it's staring at me. Then look away. No. That's exactly what it wants. I can tell this is getting painful for you. Yeah. Did you just break it? No. Just wait. It's the beginning. Of what? Of everything. Are those stars? Dark matter collecting under the force of gravity. Invisible strings just pulling everything into place. And celestial bodies just... follow. What happened? I think the universe just ended. - We should... - I just... You... We should probably get some sleep. - Yeah. - Yeah. "Buy a small country." "Kidnap Gary from the coffee shop." He never leaves. "Get brain augmenting chip installed." Yeah. I wanna read other people's minds. This is an impossible checklist. I deserve that. Where are we? We are about five minutes from where I grew up. It's basically an illegal dump site. My dad used to bring me out here. Cool. It was so dangerous. Like, exposed wires everywhere, and broken glass, and I got electrocuted, like, 100 times. - That's awesome. - Yeah. And it smelled terrible. Like, so bad. We were gonna save the world, one broken thing at a time. I loved it. Sophie? Where are you? Call me. I should probably go up and call him. Hey. I've been messaging you since we heard about the collision. Why haven't you called? My... My tablet died. You can't disappear like that, okay? Jan has been losing her mind. - Brandon got, like, really quiet. - I just... Which has never happened before. Listen, I need to tell you something. Wait... Where are you? It was supposed to be a surprise, but... Okay, check it out. This is your room. My room? It was Mom's idea. My dad built a soldering station. Brandon put together a hydroponic garden. And... and your folks. Already moved in. Just waiting on your arrival. I love it. I know I don't articulate things well... sometimes, emotions, but... I know. You said you wanted to tell me something? No. I'll see you soon. I'll see you when you land. Walt. Huh? Tell me what you think. I'm gonna hide in one of these storage boxes with this O2 canister. When you find me, in one of the storage units... in about... two-and-a-half... Let's say two hours, just to be safe. I can't. Are you afraid that I'm gonna be dead? No. Walt. Look, if the box smells like a dead body... just keep walking. I can't help you anymore. I'm sorry. But this is my life. I can't risk it. Calvin... is here. His family... My family is here. And Ginny is here. Stop acting like our situations are even remotely the same. Right. You're not supposed to be here. And you are? 'Cause you can buy a ticket. That's not fair. You know what's not fair? Try getting this close to your dreams and having someone tell you you're not good enough 37 times. Or meeting the girl of your dreams the night before she goes to another planet, or having to work... Wait. What? How long have you and Ginny been together? Since freshmen year-ish. How "ish"? The night before she left for Mars-ish. I'm gonna throw up. No, don't do that, 'cause then I'm gonna throw up. I can't believe how selfish you are. You are so obsessed with escaping your average existence that you would blow up my life, her life, for what? For some sort of adventure? For some stupid journal entry? Sophie, I couldn't blow up your life if I tried. You're living his life. That's ridiculous. Do you think he's gonna move for you? Do you think he's gonna go back to Earth for you? That he's not going to get offered a better job, and you're gonna go along with it, like you always do? You don't know anything about him. I actually do. I've had to be him. He's never gonna meet you halfway. He's never going to follow you. You're a coward, Sophie. Someday... when that stupid journal is filled... you're gonna flip through it and realize just how pointless it all was. Sophie... I'm here because I am wanted here. You are here because no one cares where you are. Identification confirmed. Greetings, Walt from Earth. You are under arrest on Mars. Hello, Calvin. And here we are. Wow. - Welcome home! - Welcome home! Hi. I missed you. I missed you. You will be kept here until the return launch. If you cannot afford an attorney, one will be provided for you. There are currently no human attorneys on Mars. If you're not here to rescue me, can you just leave? Hey, stranger. What? How are you here? I know a guy. You know a guy? This is Edgar. 'Sup? Hey, guy. Two minutes? He's awesome. You know what? He is awesome. Wow. He is also my boyfriend. My new boyfriend. Oh. You're dating my guard? You followed me to Mars after one night. Kind of needed to start dating a security guard. Just to be clear... you're not here to rescue me? No. But I did bring you some company. Ripley? Oh, my God. Hi. What are you doing here? I thought you were arrested. Time to go. You'll be okay, Walt. I mean, we both know who you're really in love with. Mars. Mars. And you made it. More or less. It says his application was rejected like 100 times. - Wow, 100 times? - 37. I don't understand why someone would wanna be somewhere they do not belong. - Yeah, you've got a point. - Well, I think it's exciting. Did you and the stowaway cross paths, Sophie? - No. - No? No. He must've been hiding. - Really? - In the air ducts or something. - Wow. Can you just imagine? - That is so stupid. So, any idea what you're gonna do now that you're here? I recommended her for a spot on my team. What? Well, they love you for it. You're totally qualified and they're always looking for young candidates who can carry out the next phase. The next phase? Yeah, the 12-year life-cycle trials. Wake up, Walt. Did you just talk? It's time to go. Gary? Is that you? I didn't really think the cat could talk. Clear? Copy. Come closer. Hello? Okay. Ripley. Hello, Walt. Holy shit. It's you. Leon Kovi. I have that same picture right by my bed. That sounded weird. I've thought about meeting you for a really, really long time. As have I. What? I have been monitoring your progress since you first entered that escape pod back on Earth. Oh, shit. Bob, you seeing this kid? Yep, kid thinks he's invisible. You have cameras everywhere? Bob says, everybody just act like you don't see him. Why didn't you arrest me? Well, I ran a profile and the risk of you impacting the journey in a meaningful way was below zero which I didn't even think was mathematically possible, but it was, it was a negative number, Walt. There was some concern that you would die in the air ducts. And the smell of your rotting carcass might disturb some of the paying guests. Bets were made. I won. That girl had nothing to do with it. - Walt! - She did. But I forced her. Not, like, forced her. Blackmail. Light blackmail. There is no such thing as "light blackmail," okay? There's no diet blackmail. You blackmailed her, it's fine. So, what happens now? Well, the board has voted to write this off as a security systems test. Ship you back to Earth and tie you up in so much legal trouble that the world at large will never hear from you again. Can I at least get my own escape pod? Walt, I hate the board. So, I leaked the security footage. I shared your whole journey with the world. Oh. You what? It's become so popular. Look how happy it makes people. I'm told it's called "Walt-ing." She's Walt-ing. He's Walt-ing. They're all Walt-ing. Walt-ing? I, myself, can't Walt. I have a bad back. But Alan here has Walted. Haven't you, Alan? I am hiding. I am a sneaky, sneaky human boy. It's very, very fresh. And now the board is terrified of a PR backlash. Please, sit. You remind me of a young me, Walt. Emotionally, that is. Intellectually, it's more of an apples to... whatever a much smarter fruit is. What's a smarter fruit, Walt? Papaya? Papaya! Yes. I'm the papaya. Do you know why the papaya came to Mars, Walt? Taxes? No, I'm a billionaire, Walt, I don't pay taxes. I bet the papaya came for the exact same reason as the simple little apple. Love? Love? How old are you? No. You wouldn't settle for the relentless onslaught of the quotidian that is life on Earth, so you came here... to Mars. This is not just a playground for the wealthy, Walt. It's a continuation of our species' rich history of curiosity and exploration. Now, we need the public and our investors to understand that. I think that you and I could help each other. You, a barista. Assistant barista. A barista's assistant. Unremarkable in every way. Truly middle of-the-road, by all metrics. Okay, I got it. Stowing away for an historic journey against impossible odds, secretly facilitated by me, of course, to discover something that just might make his meaningless little life just a smidgeon, just a tickle more meaningful. Now, that is a story people wanna hear, Walt. Oh, what's this? Walt, this has your name on it. - This is a contract. - Contract? Ceding control of your likeness to Kovi Industries for exclusive use in promotional materials in perpetuity across all universes, known and unknown. And in exchange... you may stay here. Are you serious? Welcome to Mars, Walt. Gary! Gary! Could I have solved world hunger with my money, Walt? Sure. Dozens of times over. But don't you think it's better that I came to Mars to inspire the next generation of young people - to solve world hunger? - Looking good, guys. How handsome. - Sure. - Yes, I agree. Sexy. Hey, Gary. What are they doing down there? Preparing the return vessel for launch. At the conclusion of each orbital cycle, the humans celebrate their domination of this lifeless planet. After the festivities, broken objects of little value are sent back to Earth for long-term storage. You mean, garbage? Yes. Like sexual reproduction, making garbage brings humans great happiness. But looking at it causes deep shame. It must be hidden. Are we supposed to be here? No. I have asked you to return to the habitat 11 times. All right, Gary. You win. I am Victor. Hey, Ga... Victor? Yes, Walt? I'm gonna need some tools. I don't even understand why you wanna go to this thing. It's the return party. It's gonna be fun. Plus, you can't work all the time. Which reminds me, when can I tell them you can start? Start what? The job. With my team. I don't know if it's the right fit. Um... It's the perfect fit. I mean, it's the same schedule. I still have to finish my thesis anyway so... Yes, I know, but, well, you don't need it anymore. You're here. You have a job offer. You can graduate without it. You know, it's the past. It's not the past. It's supposed to be the future. My future. Yeah, no. Good stuff, guys. Shoot me in the face. That is getting old. Oh! It almost came to that, honey, trust. I voted to eject you, but Kovi, he's a softy. You knew the whole time too? Walt, I have an IQ of 165 and I can pilot a four billion-dollar spaceship... Through an asteroid belt. Yeah. I'm sorry. It's okay. So, how you enjoying Mars? Honestly, I thought it would be different. I thought that I would get here and I would be changed or something. But now I'm here and it's exactly the same. Walt, it doesn't matter how far you travel, you can never escape yourself. Did you just come up with that? No, bitch. That is a very common phrase. - How have you not heard that before? - Never heard it. Thank God you pretty, 'cause you dumb. You pretty, but you dumb. I'm gonna talk to somebody smarter. I should go say hi to the team. Oh. Okay. Hey. Is that supposed to make us even? No. You gotta pay for that. So, where is the amazing Ginny? She is with the amazing Edgar. Her new boyfriend. You were right, though. She was just an excuse. I'm sorry. For everything. So, um, you sticking around for a while? Uh, yeah, looks like it. You? Yeah, looks like it. That's too bad. Oh. ♪ Goodbye, earthling Say hello to the Moon ♪ ♪ We'll miss you lots. We'll miss your thoughts ♪ ♪ But not your C02 ♪ What is that? Nothing. Just something silly someone gave me. Sophie. You know... nothing could ever change how much we care for you. No matter what happens between you and Calvin. Nothing's gonna happen. Well... if it did, we're your family, your constant. You're allowed to change. Wouldn't it be, like, crazy awkward? I think I know my son better than anyone. He's already crazy awkward. Sophie, go, wander. Figure out what you want. We're not going anywhere. Hey. Hey. Can we talk? I'm so sorry, Walt. I'm so sorry. Launch logistics, everyone's yapping in my ear. Where were we? Ad campaign. Right. Walt, do you remember how I told you, you could stay? Yeah? Well, we just finished the first run of our new campaign and there's been a change of plans. Seriously? Can I please just have my own escape pod? How about your very own spaceship? What? We're sending you to Ceres. It's a tiny, little dwarf planet in the main asteroid belt between us and Jupiter. And you are gonna be the very first person to ever set foot on her. Again, what? We've set up an outpost. And it's time for a ribbon cutting. You're gonna set up the ribbon, you're gonna cut the ribbon. It's gonna be very exciting. We want you there. That's... That's amazing. Thank you. Hmm. But, why me? - Can I be honest with you? - Yeah. People cannot get over how average you are. It's like a superpower or something, I don't know what it is. They look at you, and they think, "If this guy can do it, then I can do literally anything." I'll take it. Great. Good choice. Listen, you should probably get in touch with your family, friends or anyone who's important to you, 'cause you're not gonna see them for a few years. I gotta take this. Sorry, Walt. Hello. Yeah, I just ran it by him. Yeah, he's happy. He's super happy. It'll be an adventure. He's gonna be like the Little Prince. He'll be great. Hey, Alan? Yes, Walt. Could you place a call for me, please? Of course. Who would you like me to call? Sophie Tsukino. I'm sorry. Sophie Tsukino is no longer registered as a resident. What? She is the sole passenger on today's return shuttle to Earth. My records indicate she has already boarded the ship. Oh, it stinks in here. This ship smells so bad. Walt. Actually it makes sense. It's literally filled with garbage. Sir, that seat is for authorized personnel only. I know, I'm sorry. Okay. Wait, how do I... - It's the button directly... - I can't see. - Sorry. - Just hold the button. No, no, no. Just hold the down button. The same thing you did to get here. I got it. Sorry. I got it. Expect a fine. Really? Walt? Sophie? What are you doing here? I'm following you. Back to Earth. Even though I didn't invite you, or even tell you I was leaving. Making it all the more romantic? You literally did the exact same thing for another girl last month. Okay, yes. I did recently travel across the universe for love. No, no, not love. You barely knew that girl. Correct. But I do know you. You're the most frustratingly, brilliantly, - contradictorily... - Not a word. ...annoyingly talented person I've ever met. Every time I'm with you, you make me feel so dumb. In the best way possible. I'd rather be Mars's garbage flying back to Earth than boring old Walt, flipping rocks on Mars alone. So you're really gonna give up this whole Mars adventure thing? I'm not giving up anything. You're the adventure. Ah! Goddammit. What? You come in here with no plan at all just expecting everything to magically work out and then somehow, you pull that line out of your ass? Yeah. You are so annoying. I know.
