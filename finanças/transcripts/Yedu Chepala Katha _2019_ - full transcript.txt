What do women want? What do men desire? A never-ending quest. The most dangerous and also the most beautiful one in this nature is a woman I'm in the middle of an ocean by the time I comprehended certainty. I've found another guy like me on the shore.

To overcome the fear of girls, he used get satisfied by abusing their souls with the skill that I taught. Leave me Leave me Don't hurt me I'm a very sensitive, I'm more scared than you. I'm scared of girls than ghosts. Only once, please! I do this with spirits because I cannot touch them and it helps me to get over the phobia. - I'm scared of you. - Do ghosts panic? - Ghost? What shall I do now? - I will tell, Just do as I say. - I won't - You have to. - Please, I won't. I cannot - Do it... -Do it by looking at me and my beauty. Say - You are very handsome - Say it again. - You are very handsome - Say, "Sundar, Sundar! I’m mad about you." - Sundar I want to stop it, please - Where is romance? Where is romance in your face?

If he cannot decide whether it is love, fear, sorrow at the moment he can neither be a man nor a human. - Sundar Idiot Sundar, I committed suicide due to my husband's torture. Now, you are torturing me. - Don't you know Telugu? - No. - How should I communicate now?

You cannot do anything and why do you make us girls do this? Along with abusing spirits and getting satisfied, he committed a bigger crime. He has fallen in love - I love you She heard about his love a few moments before her death. She started to love him deeply.I realized that girls won't think straight even as spirits. - Meera, Meera, Why are you angry with me? Did I ever say no to you love? - Please let me touch you. - Meera, Meera Meera, You loved my soul because you are a spirit. Meera, if you are alive, you would not have even looked at me. How can I leave you? Meera? Darling? Darling? Where are you? Where did she go? Gotcha. I'm here, I'm coming Why are you hiding your face? Please let me know my mistake. Meera, Meera, Meera, I will not call you again if you don't respond.Remember, I will commit suicide too Smile, please smile. , if you don't I will tell you a fasak joke. You will roll on the floor and laugh. Hey smile, don't kill so many like this, only once fasak. - I want to touch you, hug you, kiss you. - I don't like to show my face to anyone, that's why I carry an umbrella with me, not because of the weather. Even I don't like this face, how did you love me? - Your eyes are beautiful. Guruji - Guruji, Look at me and say whether I'm happy or not - Why don't you be happy, except rape you are abusing spirits in all the possible ways. But there is some spark in your eye, what is the matter? - I'm in love Guruji. - With whom? - It's the same girl guruji, that girl. - The one alive or dead? - I proposed her a few moments before her death, after her death she accepted me, I gave her a name Guruji, Meera. - What? - Meera. - No, you are doing the same mistake as I did. - Guruji, Guruji, I want to feel my Meera's spirit Guruji. - Teach me how can I accomplish it. - Means? Finally, you have arrived at the same position as me. Naturally, your hormones are manipulating you. First things first, your Meera should have died a virgin. If you want to feel that spirit you have to make her occupy another body, and the other body has to accept it. Find a girl who can accept it. A 21 grams weight that was hidden in our body, which escapes the body and wanders not knowing what to do. You call them ghosts and are scared of them. In reality, they are scared of humans. f we can take control of them, they will listen to whatever we say. I'm living with them. - Are there any ghosts in this house? - Not a ghost. - Then? - Spirit, I want to touch my Meera. Find the reason for your pregnancy. Only I can help you, and only you can help me. Meera's spirit will enter into your body and will make love to me.Hugs me, Kisses me, your body will be medium for us, is it okay with you? Only if you accept it completely, the spirit can come into you, if you are scared it is not possible. - I don't have anything to lose. I don't anybody to trust me why would I be scared. Even if I was dead, they might have imagined that I ran away. I want to know why this happened before I die. I just want to know how I got this pregnancy. I will do anything you say. - Let's think about your problem first. Bhavana, you had sex on a day within Feb 13, 14, 15. Try to remind, Where were you in those three days? Whom did you meet? Before that, if you know any clinic around, get the reports of intact hymen test. - Intact hymen? - A kind of virginity test, just to know whether you got pregnant in a natural way or not. - What's the issue, madam? why did you come again? - I need some test reports. - Which one? - Virginity test - Oh my god! - Did you get it? - Yes, come with me Who is that guy? He is torturing me not you. This pregnancy is not due to rape, I can assure you on that, did you get it? Think about what to do with this, not how you got this. We can only abort this within 3 months. - Madam. - Yes. - Done with all the work, madam. - Okay, Ravi, can you please call Radha. - It's okay madam, I will do it. - You cannot do it, call Radha. - No, madam, however, she will assign it to me, tell me. - Are you doing all the work? - It's okay, madam, I'm doing all her works, I can anything. - Okay, wait for two minutes. - Madam, rent? - Rent? Did I ever ask you rent? - Okay, madam, thanks, madam. - Shit, I'm such a waste fellow. I'm sure, my photo will be aired on TV one day. - Hey Ravi, what happened? - You idiot, you would have told me this is vodka - No! it's not my, its Radha's - I will kill you, everyone is taking me for granted, everyone is playing with me. - Why are you shouting like that? Did she ask you rent? Aren't we doing all the stuff for the rent? - Not we, me, I'm doing, not you. She is playing with my weaknesses.Will her husband, who is in Dubai massage her legs? - Why am I having these bumper offers? - Okay then, come with us. If we can steal one extra mobile phone, it would be enough, you don't have to do all this stuff. - No! I did plenty of sins, that's enough, I don't want add-ons. - Okay, sister won't ask us rent, she donates blood once in three months. - Whats wrong in helping her with household works? - We are helping with daily chores. - Then? - After bathing, she asked me to massage her legs. - What's wrong with that? she might have a towel, right? - Yeah, she tied that to her head. - ah? - ah! - Where is your hand? Where did you bite her? - Radha, I have to leave right now, can you please have your breakfast outside? - Hey Ravi, wait I will go, I have some work. - Hey, I know what you do in the bathroom by lingering there for hours. - Hey, others might take it wrong? - Everyone knows about you, What would you do in the bathroom for so long? - Girls won't have that - Stop swearing - Swear words, you heard? I see... - I'm a girl, I'm a girl - You? - Yes. - Die - Please repair the bolt guys, I'm vexed of singing this song. Let's try a new song. What does? What does? I need more. Enough its enough. Holi is at my doorstep because of you. - I have to bath in between all this torture. - Come - Hey, what's that? - Do you want me to switch on the light? - Hard to distinguish between Radha and Ravi. Why don't you sing? - A******e! I was singing. - What did you sing? have you listen to the original one? Why are you bathing without any music sense? - I'll kill you. What does? What does? do you want? I don't know the next part - Radha? - Yes! - Can you pass me the Arun Clinic's address? - It is a worst clinic, that doctor is a sadist, don't waste your time - Do we have any other options? - We are living in a society where people thinks donating blood might affect their sex life. - When we don't know about this disease, Did we ever donate blood? Everyone has to be kind when we need something, right? We are living because of some good souls who are donating blood regularly, Okay? We appreciate the value of blood only when we need it. How can we expect someone to donate blood for free while we have to buy a water packet for Rs 2? The donor is a god for me. Sir, Sir, Sir Sir is there anyone inside? - What? - Sir, I'm a thalassemia patient, I have to inject blood every 30 days. I didn't find a donor this month, I would be grateful if you refer someone, sir. - Which group? - O positive, sir. - Mine also. - Sir, sorry sir, I came here for the donor, I could not control myself as I found a donor, please don't mind sir. - Did I say anything about donating my blood? I need the blood as much as you need, did you get it? - Sir? - I will inform you if I find the same group donor, You can talk to him. Sir, you know about thalassemia, right? I will die if I don't inject blood every 30 days. I'm an ITI student, I can service your machines for free sir. Please donate the blood for me, sir. Please sir Sir, If you don't mind can you please give me your mobile number? - Mobile? I don't use such things. - Are you serious? You don't have a mobile or you don't like to share contact details with me? - Get lost - I thought you have a mobile. If you don't mind, though it is old, it works fine. I have an extra mobile, please take it, sir. You have to take it, it is my gift. - Hey! Hey! - Listen to me, sir. - Why don't you listen? Hey, stop! Do you know her? - She is an angel who donated blood to this orphan, without even questioning. Love at first sight, sir. Sir, sir, sir, do you know her? I thought of proposing her right there, I'm formatting the mobile sir. Done, sir. - What's your name? - Ravi - Ravi, I have to tell you something, I don't know how you will take it. - It's okay, sir. I don't have anything to lose. Is it regarding Bhavana, sir? - Bhavana is pregnant, while she tried to commit suicide I saved her. - Sir? - Think wisely, if you can fabricate a story you can save her life. You have to confess that you are the reason for her pregnancy just till we know the truth. You said you love her, is that true? - Yes, sir. - Then you should confess. She helped me when no one even bothered, I would do anything to help her, sir. I will tell her that I'm the father of her kid. - Hey Ravi, I heard that fellow is cunning. Be careful, I don't think he is as good as you say. - some stupid. - Hey Radha, I have told you not to talk about donors like that. - Okay, Why are you so serious about some respected stupid, can't you ask her? - She wanted to commit suicide since she doesn't know the reason for pregnancy. If she learns I know, I can't imagine how she reacts. She wouldn't have done anything naughty. If she did, she could have aborted secretly. Something is fishy, She should live. - Hey Ravi, I think it's her employer Shall we kick his ass? What do you say? - You idiot. - Why are you kicking me? - Why did you beat him while he is trying to support you? Do you think only you have feelings? We also have feelings, do you know how many times I have cried? - Even he knows about my love, ask him. Hey Pandu, tell him. - Yes, even I'm loving her. - Look, it is mutual, that is called love. Yours is like a sim without a signal. Don't cry Pandu, I will search for someone of your size. Sorry, Pandu. - No... Beer... Radha, that's your beer only - Leave it. Stupid! - Keep this vehicle inside, it might rain. Hey, this vehicle will not work. Done with tinkering. We have to paint this. Lower ham is weak. - Hey Ravi, wake up man. - Move that lorry - You slept well, no? I didn't have sleep all night. - Why? did you bring this lorry here? - Go inside and sleep, go. - This is a turbojet engine - Please try to understand my condition, Ravi.

I saved your life by donating my blood. Is this your loyalty? Do you think this is love? - Is it enough, sir? - You are great Ravi. To be good in their lover's perspective, People commit mistakes. Though you are innocent, you took the blame and is sacrificing her. You are greate, Ravi. I love you - Why are you saying it as a message in the cinema climax? Does that mean everything is over? - Nothing like that, Bhavana's life is important Someday she will get back to you when she understands your love. - Is it sir? your looks and your words don't at all match sir. - I have accomplished what I always wanted to guruji. I'm going to meet Meera. - How? - Bhavana, I'm going to call Meera's soul into Bhavana's body, I am sexually going to meet her. - That's wrong Sundar. You cannot manipulate a girl's body. Only the girl whom you love is yours Others' body is not yours You can only get that is yours. if you go after something that doesn't belong to you. It will be your end - Guruji, Guruji, Guruji you are the one who taught me how to call souls into the body. - That's why, I did not teach you completely. - Why? - Don't end up chasing something that is not yours. - No, no you know. - Guruji, I beg you, please teach me, I will meet Meera once. I will not use it again. - Leave me. - Guruji please teach me, Guruji. - You are misusing the skill I taught. - Guruji, Guruji, I won't let you go. - Sundar, Sundar, I will not teach you completely. - Guruji! - Do you know why? - Sundar, I have taught the skill of talking to the spirits after death. - But I know how to talk to souls, even yours. - What do you like the most? - Being selfish, Guruji. - Why? - Selfishness is pure Guruji. - Will you do anything for your selfish reasons? - Yes, I will. - Can you kill me? - Guruji as you said, there is no death, only change of souls. - Bhavana, you, me and Meera, we three are same. She believed that Ravi did it. She developed anger on him and sympathy on me at the same time. She will agree even if I propose her. After that, we 3 can stay happily ever after. Am I right Meera? Meera? Shall we do it? It will be good. Meera...Meera...Meera... Its me Sundar, your Sundar. Meera? - Men will be men, you are not humans You only need the body of a woman not her feelings. - Meera... - I felt great that you are loving a spirit. - Meera's spirit never came into me. - Bhavana, Bhavana., I did nothing. This is so unfair. - Leave me! - Bhavana... - Leave me - I did not touch you. I felt meera. Listen to me, Bhavana, don't leave me, Bhavana...- You can go to prostitues for your needs. Leave me. It's not love. It's lust. - Bhavan... - Don't think love and sex are same. - You can find love in sex but love doesn't need sex - Bhavana? - Sir, I know them, sir I will be right back. - Hello, who are you? - It's me, madam. - I don't have change, please go. - No, I'm not a beggar, I think you forgot me, You came and undressed on terrace, that day. - Hey, what are you talking? - Wait sir, you weren't present that day. - I think all the lunatics are roaming on roads. Is it because her husband? We both belong to same category, Ah! She started exposing. How to control? No one let me do my work. - Tempt Ravi, I got Zandu Balm for you. - Zandu Balm! I thought women in Red light area are trying to satisfy their desires. But they are really great. I cannot do this anymore. Ammu is better than this Amruthanjan I know you will come, I used to commit in my dreams. Madam, we belong to same profession, please listen to me. Lets talk. You might get hurt, due to Zandu Balm. Try to understand Hey, is it blood? Did she bite you? This is not fair, you should have called me Don't talk to me. Buddy, how much will it cost to get Lipo? - What's happening here? - He made this room a brothel. Ravi... - I don't know whom to trust. - Bhavana, stop crying. - We are neither good nor a sadist like Sundar. Especially, Ravi. Everything is confusing, especially this guy's condition. Any girl he got tempted to, will come to his place and rape him. - Do you know any kind of black magic, like Sundaram? - It's all my mistake, there is nothing wrong of me getting tempted by looking at a girl. but you are trying to save my life, and I got horny then, honestly I feel so guilty. Shit, Its my fate! When you came into my dreams, I felt it would be nice if only this dream is true. But, I just realized that's not a dream. Sorry, But my love for you is true, madam. - Wait, wait, even I stay with you. You sleep, beside me, you lay hands on me. But, you never told me that you dream about me. Why? Whats the reason? Bhavana just a minute. We will be right back. Move aside - I thought it was a dream Radha. Listen to me. - What will you do to him? - Enough of your stories about dreams. - You know me right? - Shit, I wanted to be a virgin, you ruined everything. - Bhavana, it's me Sundar. Listen to me carefully once. If I wanted only sex, I would not ask a pregnant like you I wanted sex with love or death. I will commit suicide the same place where I saved you. My life is in your hands now. It's your wish now. - Okay, wipe your tears and come. We will do something about it. - Bhavana left, She might have heard us Without my knowledge, I'm playing with so many peoples' lives Radha. - Its not your fault. Something is fishy! The one who knows your weakness is playing with you. Isn't it? - What will they gain by playing with me Radha? - you have heard, what Bhavana told about Sundaram right? - I'm least bothered about it. I must save Bhavana. I will go beg her father straight away, I'm prepared for anything. - Hey, Ravi! - Ammu... - Sundar, Sundar Sundar - Bhavana, why should I die, think about it, do you like to see me die? You are crying for me. That means you like my desire, come. - Sundar, why are you behaving like this? - I taught you didn't like me. You are crying, that means you are loving me. You touched me only once, I cannot control myself, please let me feel you. I never knew it is hell, Please agree once, Bhavana. Let's get married, and I will even take care of your kids. I would have forced you long ago, if I wanted. But I don't want it. Please, I'm scared of myself Try to understand. Lets do it here. No one will come. Just act like you did earlier. - Please leave me, I undestood You gave me hopes on life and now, you are making me commit suicide. Kill me or I will commit suicide. - Bhavana, I won't let you die. I cannot accomplish by living. I should die. Your words right? You cannot save me this time. - Why are you rushing, death will come to everyone. If you die forcefully You will become a devil and kill me. Did I save you for that? Please think, Why should I save you from commiting suicide? My wish is stronger. If your body doesn't accept it, I will torture your spirit. Then you will only get to see my sadism, do you want to see it? You don't have any other options. I will come everyday till you accept me or dead. No one will come to save you Diwakar, help me with this for one last time. - Brother, it's an unidentified body, I can't hold it for much longer. - This is the last time, I won't ask you anymore. - Okay, brother. - Get it to the pump house near the beach. I wil pay as much as you want. - Mr Sundar, you should call a soul on to me. - Who are you? - You do that, right? I will do whatever you want me to do. - Hello, - Yes, I promise. - Okay, come. Whats the matter? - Matter only. My friend had a oneside love story, she committed suicide. - Oh my god! - No touchings She is dead with unfufilled desires. Now, that girl want to have sex with that guy. - You mean sex? - Yeah, I need your help for that. - What should I do? - If you can call her spirit into my body, I will go and have sex with him. -Oh, you will have sex with him? - Yes - What about me? - What is it with you? - The same thing... - Oh, ok ok, my friend's blood. - Move the vehicle, It's urgent. - Sorry, the vehicle won't move. - Oh you idiotic lady. - Already, Amrutha soul has entered somebody. - Will you give me a lift, I will give you whatever you want. - I will not touch living girls. - what's there behind? - What else will be there in a mortuary van? It's a dead body. Super figure. - Are you taking a dead body? - Inform me after you die. - Don't do anything to my Meera. I need my Meera. Please, I don't want anything from Bhavana and you. - Means? - My death is very dangerous, don't let me die. - Meera's body has been burned. - How? - Why Meera's soul cannot be called into anybody, Guruji? - Spirit should be a virgin. VIRGIN VIRGIN - Meera will not touch anyone even in dream. - Good morning, Madam. - Don't try to touch me while teaching. - Okay, madam. - Hey, why did you touch? This door is also not opening, let's switch places quickly, vehicles might come. - Careful, careful, careful - You are sitting on my gear, madam. - Don't touch me, move. Move You idiot. - Sundar, I will tell you a story. A story about seven fishes Not the moral storythat you heard in childhood. I yoiu want next birth, you should love generously. Then only, we can get other incarnations, and meet our loved ones again and again. - Amrutha, Amrutha Bhavana? Bhavana? Bhavana? Can you look at me? How did you come here? - Guruji, can I have a rebirth if I die now? - You should know that, Sundar. - Hey Ravi, Ravi, Come here Do you remember me?

Don't you think girls have feelings like you? Why are you talking to me like this? - Try to understand. - Now you are my husband, you have to do it even if you don't like it. Let's go, that shutter is open - You are talking like a prostitute. - Hey! Ravi!! - I'm scared! - Will you give money or not? - If you want this prostitiute's money, come and sleep with me all night.
