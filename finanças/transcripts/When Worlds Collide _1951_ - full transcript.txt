Narrator: Needles in a heavenly haystack. There are more stars in the heavens than there are human beings on Earth. Through telescopes, men of science constantly search the infinitesimal corners of our solar system, seeking new discoveries, hoping to better understand the laws of the universe. Observatories dedicated to the study of astronomy often are set in high and remote places, but there is none more remote than Mount Kenna Observatory in this part of South Africa. If our calculations prove to be correct, this will be the most frightening discovery of all time. These two bodies have traveled almost a million miles in two weeks. Is that Randall? I hope so. Stanley, I want Randall to leave as quickly as possible. All the plates are ready, cataloged and marked for identification. Here are tonight's plates, Doctor. Good. Include them. I told Professor Hendron I'd send as much detail as we had. Paul, Stanley. It won't be necessary to tell Randall what he's carrying. Z-5-M-A-P, Dave Randall from Johannesburg, Cabin Monoplane. Request permission to land. Over. Hello, Randall. This is Russ Curtis, Mount Kenna field. Visibility fine. Take runway three. Approach from southwest at 500. There's a car waiting here to take you up to Dr. Bronson at the observatory. Over. Over. Thank you, Mount Kenna field. Hello, Randall. How are you, Stan? You must have been held up at Mount Kenna field. We knew you arrived two hours ago. Oh, I had a friend's aunt for a passenger. I had to get the old lady home first. I'm Emery Bronson. Hello, Doctor. You've been well recommended to us, Mr. Randall. You shouldn't have taken much recommendation. I understand all you want is a package delivered. Did you bring your passport to the United States? Yes. But who gets delivery of what? Your recommendations said I could depend on a lack of curiosity. Dr. Bronson, I don't care what you're doing or why. All I want to know is where do I go, and how soon do I get paid? I didn't mean to be rude. It's just that secrecy is very important now. You'll fly your plane to Lisbon, then take the transatlantic clipper to New York. The delivery will be made to Dr. Hendron at the Cosmos Observatory. Here are several poses of Dr. Hendron. The delivery must be made to him personally. Remember that. To Dr. Hendron only. Right. You'll require this for expenses. I'm supposed to get paid $1,500 plus the expenses. Hendron will pay you on delivery. Time is all that counts. The money doesn't matter at all. With me, Doctor, money always matters. Perhaps now, but the day may arrive when money won't mean anything. Not to you, nor anyone. When that happens to me, I'll be six feet under. Good luck, Randall. There was another radiogram for you at the last stop, Mr. Randall. Thank you. I hope you're enjoying your trip. Yeah, it's very nice. Thanks. Honestly, the inspection takes longer than the trip abroad. I brought Clara a few things. She's so appreciative. 50% duty? I'd rather junk the stuff right here. I think that's the man, the one carrying the black box. I'll see. David Randall? That's right. May I see your passport, please? Thank you. Fine. I'll handle this, Jim. Give him his luggage, will you? That brown one over there. Right this way, please. Here's your man. How do you do? I'm Joyce Hendron, Professor Hendron's daughter. We're to go straight to the observatory. This is better than having a motorcycle escort. You'll need a pass to get out of the building. The pass. Thank you. You're welcome. Right this way, Mr. Randall. Donovan: Mr. Randall! Oh, Mr. Randall! Mr. Randall, I'm Donovan from the sentinel. Some other time. We've raised our offer to $7,500. Here's a check to your order. No, thanks. I'm working on a better offer. I can't imagine how the Sentinel even had a hint about your errand, but it's difficult to keep secrets from the newspapers. I'm glad you turned them down. You know what it would mean if the public had this information prematurely. Of course. We've been praying Dr. Bronson is wrong, that these pictures will show some error in his calculations. Mmm-hmm. Don't you find yourself wishing? Wouldn't you almost rather not know? On, it's better to know. I wish I had your courage. But I'm frightened. As frightened as all those people would be if they knew. I haven't the courage to face the end of the world. Joyce. I'm glad you waited for me. So am I. Tony, this is Mr. Randall. Dr. Drake. How are you? How do you do? Alice, didn't my father know Dr. Drake was here? I told Alice not to bother him. He has some people with him. It's a special meeting of the observatory's trustees. They'll want to see you right away. You smoke? Yeah, thanks. I'll try one. Have a south African one. You part of this deal, Doctor? This stargazing? No. No, I confine my gazing to the eye, ear, nose, and throat. I'm an M.D. I gather you're not an astronomer, either. Me? No, I'm just a high-priced messenger boy who's beginning to have doubts about the sanity of astronomers. They ought to stick to making wrong predictions about the weather. Astronomy is a very exact science. Maybe so, but when they start telling me doomsday is just around the corner, we part company. Who's been telling you that? Mr. Randall? Come right this way. Hello, Tony. Come along, if you want to. Please. One second. Please, I have people waiting. I'm supposed to make sure. Oh, yes, of course. They check. Who told you that, about doomsday? Why, Doc, I thought you were practically a member of the family. Put it on the desk, Randall. Please. Oh, thank you, dear. Dr. Bronson said I was to get $1,500. I'll take care of it. This is supposed to be COD. Hold still, please. Thank you. Would you mind waiting in the anteroom, Mr. Randall? He knows all the details, dad. Dr. Bronson and I have no secrets from each other. Bronson been at this study a long time? Two years. But I first heard from him 10 days ago. He wanted me to check his findings. Give this data to DA. "D" for differential, "A" for analyzer. Differential analyzer. DA. Naturally. We'll check these through the viewer. Dr. Henaron, the key. Later, Randall, later. Sometimes I wish I didn't know Bronson's capabilities so well. He rarely leaves any margin for error. This was Bronson's first discovery, Bellus, a star, a dozen times larger than our Earth. Bellus has been approaching Earth at tremendous speed. Bronson's second discovery, a new planet. Bronson named it Zyra, and his measurements show this new body revolves around Bellus more rapidly than Earth revolves around the sun. Hmm, this is in the constellation of Scorpio. Dr. Frye, notice the position of these new bodies. Yes. Yes, I see. But here again, Bellus and Zyra have changed position. Now, just how fast they've been moving and their eventual destination are among the mathematical problems now being determined by our differential analyzer. We'll have the results in a few hours. Zyra is about the same size as our Earth. Both these bodies are coming into our solar system. If Bronson's readings are correct, they will destroy the Earth. How far away from us are they? The calculator will be precise. I would estimate about three billion miles. Billion? Let people start worrying 100 years from now. Mr. Randall, you've been flying ships faster than sound for many years. These bodies are moving thousands of times faster. They could be upon us in less than one year. Now, I repeat, all this depends on Bronson's findings being correct. The planet Zyra will pass very close to us, close enough to influence the tides. Oceans will be torn from their depths. Tidal waves hundreds of feet high will sweep in from the coasts. There will be giant earthquakes. Handfuls of people may survive if provisions are made. We'll make them, every possible effort. Whatever help my factories can give, we will give gladly. It will be useless. Soon after, Bellus will come into direct collision with the Earth. Our world will end. There is no error. I always wanted to do this. Want to try it? It's funny, I keep thinking about a Mr. Simmons. One of those incurable cases. I used to wonder how he felt the day he asked me how much longer he had to live. Now, I think I know. Joyce? Yes? Let's not put off getting married. There isn't any reason to wait now, is there? I promised dad I'd wait. There'll be so much to do. Darling, your father will be the first to agree with me. The time that's left should be ours. We're entitled to be that selfish when we know what's coming. I'd feel better if I talked to dad first. He'll be home the day after tomorrow. Dr. Drake? Yes. There is a call for you. They said it was the hospital. Oh, thank you. Excuse me. I'll be right back. Now, I never used to believe my mother's stories about Americans being the most progressive people. I thought she was boasting because she was born here. But this is proof of progress. They charge for drinks by the inch. Look, stargazer, arithmetic's your department. Now, how much is seven times two-and-a-half dollars, huh? Real progress, $17.50 per bottle. Want to tell me something, stargazer? What is it? You and the doctor going to get married? I don't know. Maybe you could tell me where I could find out. Why? I'd like to stop being just an interested bystander. Bronson gets in tomorrow. I'll have to tell him how right he was. He said the day was coming when money wouldn't mean a thing to me. May I trouble you for another light? Thank you, madam. This is the day. Money to burn. Oh! As chairman of this assembly, I have a very definite duty to perform. I do not intend questioning the scientific accuracy of your statement. I am not a scientist and thus, I am not qualified to question your findings. But I must ask one question, that all the delegates here want answered. I hope I have your confidence. You are satisfied that there is no error? You are confident that all the facts are correct? Yes, sir. The effect of Zyra's passing should be felt about 1:00 on the afternoon of July 24th. Mister Chairman - I wish to put a question to the learned doctor what about the giant star, Bellus? Can the doctor tell us when this second body will threaten? Nineteen days later. Bellus will crush the Earth on the morning of August 12th. This is not a publicity-seeking campaign. We are completely aware that most of our colleagues ridicule our findings. But believing what we do, we have no choice but to ask for this hearing. Mr. Chairman, we are here to give these gentlemen the hearing they requested. Therefore I ask you, Dr. Hendron, if it is with complete certainty that you tell us the world will end on next August 12th? Precisely that, sir. A civilization almost as old as time itself will be wiped away? All human life will be destroyed? There is a possibility, a very remote one, that a few people may be saved. The world will be destroyed, but a few people will be saved? The world, our world, will come to an end on August 12th, in slightly more than eight months. There is no margin for error in that, sir. But we believe that the planet Zyra once contained living matter. We believe, and this is theory, not certainty, that some form of vegetation may still exist on Zyra. You are proposing that we all pack our trunks and move to... Zyra? No, sir. But we are hoping that, with God's help and guidance, a few people may do exactly that. A 20th-century Noah's ark, huh? Yes, one or more of them, as many as can be built in this short time. Eventually, as Zyra and Bellus speed closer toward us, even a layman will be able to see the danger. Much as a train looms up in the distance, in an instant, it is upon you. With enough funds, labor, and material, Dr. Frye believes that rocket ships can be built to fly to Zyra, which will be closest to us. But, remember, eight months is very little time for construction. Only if work begins immediately can this be done. If you wait until the danger is visible to the naked eye, it will be too late to escape. Bellus and Zyra will be upon us and crush the Earth. That is the most absurd. Dr. Ottinger, of the Estabrook Observatory. Gentlemen, my colleagues, Dr. Felix Zenta, Professor of Astronomy at Cornwall University, and Dr. Jonathan Wilson, President of the International Planetary Research Institute, and I have examined the photographs and data submitted by Drs. Hendron and Bronson. Our findings show there is no cause for alarm. No reason to spend billions of dollars to build spaceships which never will be needed. And suppose they were built? Do either of you believe that spaceships can fly to any planet? It is theoretically possible. I, too, believe in theories, Doctor, but when you tell me flying to another planet is a possibility, you're out of the realm of theory. You're in a dream world of the impossible. Even if the world were to end would it be less unpleasant to die out in space than here on firm ground? The world will not end. Certainly, these new bodies will pass our planet. Heavenly bodies frequently do. But we are still here. Predicting the end of the world is an annual crackpot event in our society, an attempt to corner the newspaper headlines. But I did not expect a man of Dr. Hendron's background to join this headline-hunting parade. Read all about it! End of the world just around the corner! Read all about it! Get your... Let's be thankful for small favors. The subcommittee didn't believe a word we told them, but at least they didn't ridicule us. No one believes us. How will we ever interest enough private capital? It's hopeless. I believe you, Bob. I'll buy you a start on your rocket ship. At my age, I'll settle for the satisfaction that I contributed toward salvaging something from our old world. Hey, I'm older and richer than you are. I'll arrange the lease on a large enough camp, one of the government's old proving ground sites. Why, between Marsden and me, you'll have enough to start construction. Wonderful, Spiro. Wonderful! I'll arrange the details for our next meeting. Right. Super. Gentlemen. Have you got a minute, dad? I'm marking time. We have an appointment with Sydney Stanton. Is he going to give you the rest of the money you need? I hope so. He phoned for the appointment. Tony's outside. Well, I'm sure he didn't come to see me. He wants to marry me now. I don't blame him. Isn't marriage what you want, honey? Oh, I've liked Tony more than any other man. I was always sure we would get married one of these days. Joyce, dear, there isn't time for uncertainty. You have to answer this question. Do you want to spend what time is left with Tony, as his wife? I wish I could answer it. I suppose it really doesn't matter. And it is what Tony wants. Not what you want? I don't know that, either. Oh, dad, I'm so mixed up. I can't think straight. Do I know this subject of your confusion? Dave Randall. I don't know why, when, or where, dad. I've told myself I like being with him only because he's someone new, someone different. Yes? Woman: Mr. Stanton is here. Tell Dr. Frye, and send in Mr. Stanton. You told me to answer the question for you, Joyce, remember? Let Tony wait a while longer. And you, you give me two minutes after Stanton leaves to figure out a good excuse to keep Dave Randall right here. Oh, thanks, dad. Thanks. Dr. Hendron. Mr. Stanton. This is Dr. Frye. Doctor of what? Dr. Frye is the Dean of the eastern school of technology. All right, I'm in here safe and sound. Go outside and read the magazines. What about this Noah's ark? Will it get to that new planet? In theory. On the calculation of some engineers, such a flight is possible. Two of your observatory trustees, Marsden and Spiro, tell me that you have an equipped campsite, but you need money to finish building the ship. A great deal of money. Millions. Amounts don't stagger me. I'm just weighing the percentages. Your word against the word of other astronomers, Wilson, Ottinger, Zenta. I've talked to them. They think you're a crackpot. I know. It will mean liquidating some of my business interests. It may mean the salvation of a civilization. Their salvation doesn't interest me! Mine does. I'm no humanitarian like your friends, Marsden and Spiro. I just don't relish dying. What are the chances of existence on this new planet? We don't know. We can only hope they're good. Millions for theories. The end of the world is no theory to us, Mr. Stanton. If I thought it was, I wouldn't be here. All right, I'll pay for the rest of your ark. Hendron: Splendid. One thing, I select the people who'll go with us. This won't be a commercial liner. There may be space for 40 or 50 human beings, some machinery and livestock, the minimum needs to begin a new life. You're not qualified to select those people. Nevertheless, I reserve that privilege. Make up your mind. It is made up. You admit you don't relish dying. You're willing to put up this money as life insurance. The guarantee that if the world ends, you'll be among the few with a chance to reach this new world. That makes my proposition a simple one. Your money for your life. We'll do the picking together, half and half. No. Why not? Why should you set yourself up as the only one to give life or take it away? The proposition still stands. Your money for your life. You know I can't refuse. Build it. "Herzog, Mason, Fitzsimmons, Brown, "Parson, Grossman, Stone, Ising, Matisse, "Garson, Marachek, Van Dyke, Duvall, Ortego, Cassinelli." You are the men selected. Gentlemen, this is a rough design of our ship. Now, instead of taking off in the customary manner, straight up, we will conserve fuel by using a mile-long slide to give us impetus. For this slide, the ship will be cradled on a rocket-propelled undercarriage, which will be automatically released at the end of the run. At approximately this point, the wing engines will be turned on, and here, the full power of all engines will be used to carry us out of the gravitational pull of the Earth. We will then be in free ascent, and no power will be used until we reach the gravitational pull of Zyra, at which time the ship will be operated as a normal aircraft. Similar rocket ships are also being constructed in other countries. Now, about our camp and its working conditions. Dave Randall, who is assisting Dr. Hendron, will talk to you about that. Dave. Thank you, Dr. Frye. First, I want to say you men were selected because you are the top engineering students here. The agricultural students, our mechanics, all our men and women were picked this way. The project needs you because you are fine technicians. You are healthy. You are free to make your own decision. There is no guarantee that the ship will reach Zyra, but those who will make the flight will be chosen by lot sometime before the worlds collide. Now, only about 40 persons can be taken, and already, there are more than 600 people working on this project. Go down in the bunker first. Man on PA: Joyce Hendron, please take your new arrivals to dormitory C. Got the cards for this group? Yes, sir. Are my cards ready, Jerry? Right here, Miss Hendron. All right, fellows, this way. Thanks. I'll leave these at the clinic. Follow me, girls. Dr. Frye, there is a call for you from the microfilm laboratory. Eddie: Julie! Attention, new arrivals. I'll see you later. Attention, please. Check in at the medical clinic within 30 minutes. Attention, new arrivals. Attention, please. Check in at the medical clinic within 30 minutes. Dr. Bronson, please. Dr. Bronson, will you go to the chart room? Attention, main garage. Two jeeps are needed immediately at the foot of the ramp approach. Animals now waiting for unloading oh east end side. Hello, Tony. Joyce! Did you have a nice trip? Seventy new people. Where's dad? Dr. Ottinger asked him to come to New York for a conference with Wilson and Zenta. Oh, well, I'll put these new cards in the file. Is this the new design? That's right. The drawings came while you were away. Bronson tells me Ottinger and the other doubting thomases have jumped over to our side of the fence. That will put an end to the newspapers calling me a lunatic. "Stanton's Folly." With time running out on them, they'll wish they had a fleet of Stanton's follies. No. They admit our calculations on Zyra and Bellus are correct, but they insist our flight is an impossibility. Even in other countries where ships are being built, most scientists say the flight isn't possible. And you? I believe as I did before. In theory, it should work... Always theories. Jigsaw puzzles on paper. Aren't you fellows ever positive? Only about doomsday. A representative of the government will warn the people tomorrow. Provisions will be made to evacuate them to mountain locations. What provisions have you made to protect us when the panic starts? I haven't thought about it. I have. I don't deal in theories. I deal in realities. Ferris! Ferris! Yes, sir? Bring in those boxes. I brought enough rifles to stop a small army. There won't be any panic in this camp. Stop theorizing. Once the havoc is over, every mother's son remaining alive will try to get here and climb aboard our ship. People are more civilized than that. They know only a handful can make the flight. You've spent too much time with the stars. You don't know anything about living, the law of the jungle, the human jungle. I do. I've spent my life at it. You don't know what your civilized people will do to cling to life. I do, because I know I'd cling if I had to kill to do it. And so will you. We're the lucky ones, the handful with a chance to reach another world. And we'll use those guns. You'll use them, Doctor, to keep your only chance to stay alive. Ferris. Ferris! Man on TV: There can be no question that some crisis impends. The secretary is on his way from the committee room. We will have his message in a moment or two. Secretary: My friends, it is imperative that you listen closely, for this is a matter of life or death. Your lives, the lives of everyone on Earth. At 1:00 on July 24th, Zyra, a new planet, will pass so close to the Earth, it will cause vast destruction. There is no doubt about the coming of Zyra. Remember, there is no doubt. By 1:00 on that day, all populations must have been evacuated from coastal areas. Plans have been made, and all that can be done will be done. When I was a kid, I read a book about the world coming to an end. I remember being so scared, I didn't dare go to sleep. And in the morning, the sun came out and everything looked so wonderful, I forgot the story. Life was beautiful all over again. The same sun will be shining on the new world. Look, stargazer, I don't figure in this new world. For the past couple of months, you and I have been telling recruits that the few who will make the trip will be needed in the new world. Scientists like you and your father, Tony, farmers and mechanics, you have things to offer, but you won't be needing aerial taxi drivers for another hundred years. Dad promised me that... Dad said we'd need you. Thanks. Thanks, but Noah would have turned down my application fast. But Dave... I'm not applying for this trip. Use a little arithmetic. The ship's cargo is limited. Every pound will count. I weigh as much as a couple of lambs, three dozen chickens, one healthy farmer. We're coming in. Better see that they're strapped down. Randall calling plateau tower. Come in, please. Over. Man 1 on radio: Schedules of train, bus, and plane departures will be made available... Man 2: Plateau tower. Man on PA: Attention, please. Attention, please. The commanding general will speak to you. Stand by. General: This is an official order. The evacuation will now proceed in an orderly manner. There will be planes enough for all. Women and children will be loaded aboard first. Families will not be separated for long. I repeat this. Families will only be separated for the duration of the evacuation flight. Women and children will now proceed to the designated planes. Man on TV: Never before in the history of the world has humanity felt so close to God. As Zyra inexorably rushes toward us, perhaps to destroy the Earth, men and women of all races and creeds pause to think, to pray, and to atone. As the evacuation of coastal cities progressed, tales of individual acts of heroism and sacrifice poured into newspaper offices. With few exceptions, transportation and utility workers volunteered to remain at their posts until the evacuation is completed. Overnight, populations of inland cities were more than doubled. Deserted, the once-great city of New York is a ghost town. Ten million mighty, roaring machines suddenly shut off, waiting for the approach of Zyra. The silence, an eerie foretelling of the destruction to come at 1:00, the hour of doom. According to your figures, by how we were supposed to feel the effects of Zyra's passing. Tidal waves, oceans torn from their beds. Millions of dollars for a false alarm. Ottinger called you a crackpot. I think all you scientists are crackpots. Nothing is going to happen. Ferris. Joyce, are you all right? Yes, dad. I'm over here. Man on PA: Attention! The ship is breaking loose! Emergency crews to ramp! Emergency crews to ramp! Move those I-beams to the ship! Come on! Go to the crane! Use the hook to stop the undercarriage! Right. Lower the block! Look out! The crane is falling! Bronson. Man on radio: This is emergency camp nine again. Is anyone left? Can anyone hear us? We are located 11 miles due north of Middletown. Emergency camp nine repeating... About 100 miles from here. There is a desperate need here for drinking water. Anything else for the helicopter, Doctor? Yeah, those boxes. I'll bring the rest. Repeating. We are remaining on the air. Repeating. Can anyone hear us? We need drinking water and medical supplies, plasma, penicillin and sulfa. You needn't come along, Randall. I can fly a helicopter. I've done a lot of this parcel dropping. I can handle it without you. You sound as if somebody rubbed you the wrong way. That's an excellent diagnosis. Would you like to prescribe a cure? You're the doctor. You name it. Now or later? We need drinking water and medical supplies desperately! Plasma, penicillin, sulfa. Later. Come on. Is anyone left? Can anyone hear us? What's that? For a minute, Doc, I thought maybe now was that "later" you mentioned. I gave it a passing thought. We cannot postpone the inevitable. This meeting was called to choose those who will make the attempt to reach Zyra. As most of you already know, our human cargo must be restricted to 7,000 pounds, 44 persons. Every pound consumes fuel, a commodity we cannot waste if the flight is to have any chance. About 900 pounds already have been spoken for. Mr. Stanton, Dr. Frye, my daughter, myself, Dr. Drake, and Mr. Randall. Unless there is some objection, we intend including another 40 pounds. Our latest addition to the camp. Now to again emphasize our fuel problem, most of it will be consumed in overcoming Earth's gravitational pull. But once this has been accomplished, engines will be turned off until we come into the gravitational pull of the new world. But then, in turning the ship completely around, every ounce of fuel will be needed to avoid crashing. Dr. Frye and I hope we have worked out a sound plan. For the sake of efficiency, it would be unwise for one man to know he is not to go, whether the man working at his side is among the fortunate few. In this envelope is a list of numbers, the numbers of those who will go. In these boxes, we have placed numbered disks. The one on the left for the women, the other for the men. Each of you will select and keep one disk. This list will be posted on the dormitory bulletin boards shortly before the takeoff. Is this plan satisfactory? If there are no objections, please start the drawing. This is the men's box. Your box here. You pick both numbers. This is the women's box. You're already listed. Hello, Dave. I've been looking for you. Not to quarrel about your sense of ethics, just to ask you why. I haven't any more right to a ride on that ship than any other man in this camp. I'll Grant you that. I'll even admit my motive was a selfish one. I want to do things according to Hoyle, Dave, but, well, Joyce is pretty important to me. And to me. I'm glad. I'd do anything to insure her chances, wouldn't you? It isn't a free ride for Joyce. She's qualified to go. No more than some others. We're stretching the point because she's important to both of us. But why not, for her sake, stretch the point a bit farther to include you? No. Now, look, Doctor, I've wrestled with this thing for weeks. I can give you a dozen reasons why I shouldn't go. Can you give me one good reason to include me? She wants you, Dave. That'll change. Tony will be there. She's used to having him around. They would have been married if I hadn't come into the picture. Anyhow, why worry? Maybe I drew a lucky number. You didn't take any number from that box. I had the exact number of disks in it, one for every man and woman, except the six people I named. If you had taken a number, we would have been one short. OK, Doctor, the drawing is over. You can't open a new one or issue new numbers without starting a revolution among the lucky winners. It's about time I donated something to this setup. I won't be needed. I never have been. Anyhow, I didn't give up much by not drawing. What's one chance in 600? Leaving me will save fuel. Let it stay that way. And, Doctor, I hope you won't say anything to Joyce. Good night. Man on PA: Attention, everyone. Bellus growing larger, getting closer every hour. And with every hour, the time left to us gets shorter, so hurry. More welders are needed by number three construction crew. Please rush. Less than seven days left. We're falling behind schedule. Trucks are waiting to load plasma and medical supplies. They should have been aboard now. Hurry! Hurry! Attention, please. Less than six days left to Bellus. We're still falling behind schedule. Number five construction crew, report to the main bunker. Hurry. Now, this engine's all right. Let's try this one. I'll take it. It'll work out all right, Joyce. Please. Everyone, only 79 hours left before the collision with Bellus. We're still more than three hours behind schedule. Make it up! Hurry! Worried? No. This ship is really put together. If anything can make it to the new world, this one will do it. Dave? Yeah? How long would it take to learn this flight panel board? A few weeks, maybe. But Dr. Frye knows the inside and outside of every knob on the panel. He can operate it almost in his sleep. I hope so. What'll happen when he blacks out? Everyone will black out in the fast climb. But the direction will be set. This will hold you on course. All the way to Zyra? No, but far enough. The blackout won't last too long. A few minutes, tops. This is no time to start doubting the ship, Doc. I'm not. I know how well it's been put together. The trouble is, I just learned how Frye's put together. Hmm? His chance of coming out of a blackout isn't good. Well, I've seen older men make it. His heart won't hold together. No coronary condition like his could stand that pressure. When did you discover that? Yesterday, when I made his cardiograph test. I haven't told anyone yet, not even Frye. Well, don't. It won't help to scare everyone. Like doomsday, that can't be avoided. We can't let Frye handle this flight. Look, Doc, maybe... Maybe... no. Dr. Hendron and Frye must be told. I can't take that responsibility. That isn't what I wanted to say. No, I mean, you're right. You'll have to tell them, I guess. There's no other choice. Anything happens to Frye when we get out into space... I don't suppose it makes any difference crashing from 1,500 miles up or dying right here on Earth when Bellus hits. Either way, you're just plain dead. After the blackout, one of the technology students, Eddie Cummings, maybe, could take over if Frye tells him what to do. If Frye is able to tell him after the blackout. Look, Dave, you're hedging. Why? We both know who else can handle this flight. Maybe not as good as Frye, but good enough. You haven't any doubts about being able to fly this ship, have you? No, I can fly her. Well, there isn't anyone else. Dave, you're our life insurance. If Frye doesn't make it, you'll be able to land the ship. For months, I've tried to find a legitimate reason to go along. I never could. Maybe things were meant to happen this way. Diagnose it any way you want. All I know is, I feel a lot easier not having to tell Frye the news about himself. Be right back. Dave: Joyce! This is the last of the chloroform. Put it somewhere handy to the animal pens. You gonna give the animals a Mickey Finn, Doc? If we don't, the pressure will drive them mad. This way, they'll stay strapped down. Wouldn't want to see them kick the ship apart, would you? No, sir. I'll never forget what you did for Dave and me, Tony. Well, I told you the doctor would fix everything. Come here, whatsis. Come on, now. Well, where are you from, boy? He's mine! Where'd you get him, Mike? Downtown. You mean, down at the airfield? Uh-huh. He was walking around. I hate to remind you, but you said the doctor could fix everything. Oh, that's right, I did, didn't I? Well, let's weigh him. Incidentally, he's a she. Joyce: Nine pounds, two ounces. Sure. Whatsis is gonna pinch-hit for a couple of plump chickens. Isn't that wonderful? Man on PA: This is urgent! Twenty-three hours left, and we're still 32 minutes behind schedule! Those posted to make the attempt to reach Zyra report without delay to Dr. Drake. Well, what did you expect? My number! It's on! It's on the list! Julie, I'm on the list! Julie! Julie! Julie! My number! I'm on the list! Julie! No, Julie, no. Now, remember, if we delay the takeoff tomorrow as long as possible, Zyra's position will form a perfect orbit with ours. I hope we can retain that extra fuel to keep us flying over Zyra while we look for landing room. Zyra will be about here in relation to Earth. If you can hold the ship to this curve, we will be able to meet her orbit and run on a parallel. The fuel will last much longer with less cargo. Why risk our necks by taking so many people? You and that chair weigh 186 pounds. That's worth a lot of fuel, Mr. Stanton. Would you like to donate that weight? No more than you want to donate your life or your daughter's. I paid for finishing this ship. Without me, you would have been wiped out with the rest of the world. Before you opened your pocketbook, you tried to make this a personal enterprise, a private rocket ship for your own special use. This project was started by real humanitarians, by Marsden and Spiro. They gave their money with no strings attached. You're not here under any special license. You're always shouting for facts, not theories. Well, remember these facts. Our chance of reaching the new world is as thin as your chance of ever becoming a humanitarian. If we do make it, will there be a place to land? Will the air be fit to breathe? Will there be water? Vegetable life? Men and women here have been praying for God's help and guidance. Not your kind of hypocritical praying, but the kind that comes from deep inside a man. I'm sorry. I'll come back later. No, no, Eddie. Come right in. We can't put things off till later. I just wanted to leave this for someone else to use. He has a girl. Julie Cummings. I guess he doesn't want to leave her. There's that extra fuel. He must weigh close to 180. You heard him volunteer to stay behind. Shut the door. You're not taking it from him. He turned it back of his own free will. Get out, Ferris. The other side of the door for you! Ferris: Shut up. This is one of the good ones, isn't it? I'm sorry. The people have all been selected. I'm going, too. Put that gun down. I'd almost rather kill you than go along. For seven years, ever since I started pushing this chair around, I've hated your insides. You're a very easy man to hate. I'd like to reason things out with you, Ferris. - You see... - No! You three are running things here. You're going to tell everybody I'm going. This is my number. That's all the reasoning I want to know. And if I don't go... He was going to kill us. You d better give it to me. I told you this would happen. And not just Ferris. There'll be others, all of them. They won't just sit still and wait to die here. He may be right. Now, this one's dead and there's been a lot of bad feeling. One boy was stabbed right after the list was posted. There's been a couple of fistfights. I told you. It's dog-eat-dog, the law of the jungle. I guess we can't risk his being right. What do we do now? Well, we can move the women on board, lock the ramp gates. The men can wait outside the ship until we take off. The guns are in my room, boxes of them. That's out. We'll have to move people and animals as quietly as possible. Dave? There's a girl... Julie Cummings. Tell her there's been a mix-up in the listing. She and Eddie Garson are going. We'll gamble on less flying time over the new world. Let me tell you... Don't say it, Stanton! Don't say anything. The last dawn. I think we can start boarding. All right, everyone, inside the ship! I'll bring Mr. Stanton. And why should our lives be decided by a raffle? How do we know the drawing wasn't fixed? It should have been done by voting! Let's take the ship away from them! Hey, Mike! Gangway, boys. Here are the guns old man Stanton left. Mike: That's all we need! Let's go! Grab a gun. Wait, fellows, there's no sense in this! We all agreed to the drawing! Listen to him! Listen! You can take the ship, sure. Then what? Only 40 of you can get away. Don't you see? Then the rest of us will get rid of that 40 and the next 40 until we kill each other, or we all get caught when the worlds collide. Stick around till the collision puts you out of your misery. Come on! Get me on board. You were right, Mr. Stanton. You're a better judge of people than I am. Get me on board. No, Hendron. What are you doing? Stop him! Hendron, what are you doing? No. Wait! Help! Dr. Hendron! Get on board! Hurry! Get on board! Hold the gangplank! Dr. Hendron! Hold the ramp! Wait! We're the extra fuel they might need, Stanton. The new world isn't for us. It's for the young. Dave! The ship is moving! Stand by! Frye: We're out of the pressure zone. The engines are off. We're on course. You invented those cardiographs for my benefit. Yours and Joyce's. How's it look? A quarter full. Better than we expected. We'll need every bit of it. Or we'll hit the new world head-on at ten miles a second. We're getting close. In a minute or two, we'll feel the pull. Turn the ship. Start all engines. We're slowing. Can I cut one engine? Not yet. Keep them all going. We're using fuel too fast. We have no choice! Keep all the engines going. The ship has turned for landing, Dave. Take over. Frye: Thirty-five thousand. 30 thousand. Twenty-five. Cut wing engines one and six. Frye: Twenty-two thousand. 20. I'm going to level off. Brace yourselves! We're leveling the ship! Anywhere. Land anywhere. We've got to. Not yet. Check your belts! Fuel's gone. There's an opening! There go the engines. I'll bring it around and try to glide in. It looks frozen. I hope so. We're going to find out. We made it! We're here! We're on Zyra! Let's get out! Congratulations! A wonderful landing! Nice going! Dave, wait! Don't open the outer door until we've tested the atmosphere. We'll get a sample through the airlock. Never mind. Good air or bad, it's the only place we can go! We better wait here. Best air I ever tasted. Break out the gangplank! Mike! Where is he? Hey, Mike, don't you want to see the sunrise? Our first citizens. And they're all mine. Dave: They sure are. Tony: Every one. Well, let's leave whatsis and the puppies here. Now, let's go look at the first sunrise, huh?
