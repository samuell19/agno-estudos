I brought my friends over for dinner. - Yes, sir. - Good. - Ah Ming, Chun let's go swim. - Great! Get in here! - Ah Ming, come in! - Yeah! Come join us! Enjoy yourselves, I want to be alone. - Why won't you come in? - Well, enjoy yourself! Hey, Ah Ming! Chun Yin, happy birthday! This broach is for your birthday. - Thank you. - Try it on. Okay. It's really beautiful. I already bought the tickets for the movie... Hey, guys get in. Let's go for a cruise on my dad's boat. Can we wait Wei is coming too. Come on, let's get in the car. I have something for you. - Happy birthday. - Thanks. Here. Open it and tell me if you like it. It's so beautiful! I love it, thank you! She don't get it. I can't tell her. That I love her so deeply. And I'm losing her... Father... We're too poor. You were always bullied and were forced to commit suicide. No way... Even if it costs me my life. I must get Chun Yin back. She belongs to me! To me! Ah Ming, why do you drink and smoke so much? - Mom, I'm fine. - You know you can tell me any problems you have. I'm fine... Mom, I have good news. - Really what is it! - I've been accepted to the Nanyang University. That is amazing son! It's good to get an education. But... University costs so much. - Yeah, it costs hundreds of thousands. - What? I don't have enough saved. How will we pay for this? I can work part time... - I'm sure at least a 100 thousand will be enough. - 100 thousand is enough!? I've been saving up money for several years just for a day like this. I have 80 thousand in the bank. Tomorrow I'll borrow the other two thousand and it'll be enough. Thank you mom! - I'll never forget what you've done for me. - You must study hard okay? And after you graduate you'll have a wonderfully good job. Go to the bank and get the money tomorrow. Please do this for your father and make him proud. Ah Ming, this is so sudden you deciding to go to school. And we wish you weren't going. - I'll be back soon. - I'm going to the States next month. We'll keep in touch. And don't forget me, write or please call. Yes... Excuse me. - Ah Ming! - Mom, I told you not to come. I have to see you leave. You're my only son and I'm so proud. - Please don't be sad and take care. - I know, just don't forget to write. - Mom, I need to go the plane's leaving soon. - I'm leaving, good bye. - Goodbye. - Goodbye and good luck. Ah Ming, who's the old lady? She's...she's my servant. I need to catch the plane. See you Ah Wei. See you. Goodbye Yin... Goodbye. Ah Ming, hurry get in. Sorry, I'm running so late. - I thought you forgot about me. - No, of course not. I'm late because my car kept breaking down on the way. So were you able to find that master who can teach me curses? Yeah, his name is La Pin. This is his address. Thanks, can you take me there now? I don't get why you want to see this guy. Let's go, stop wasting time. Come on. Ah Ming, the car can't go through the 'Black Forest'. Just go down that road until you see his hut. Okay. - Be careful, I'm taking off now. Bye. - Goodbye. - Bye. - Bye. So, it's you again. I did what you wanted last time. Yes, Master... - Was there a problem last time? - No, it was perfect, thank you. So, what is it now? I fell in love with another man. But, something isn't right about him. No matter how well I treat him... He don't seem to care about me. Master, I really love him. - I must have him. - How old is he? Is he already married? You must know, I won't do anything to ruin a family. His name is Ah Won... We knew each other when we were children. We grew up together and he hasn't married yet. He is 25 years old. That's good. This is just an ordinary "Love Curse". I guarantee you will have him at once. But... If lives are not entwined by fate... The "Love Curse" will disappear after 3 months. - Understand? - I understand. Now... I'll perform the ceremony. Now, get up and get dressed. This is the Lotus-Leaf Rice... take it home and get him to eat it. After that, he will be enamoured by you. Remember... - This Curse only lasts for 3 months. - Thank you, Master. Go... Young man. The ceremony is over you may come in. Master. Young man... What do you want me to do for you? Well, nothing...Master... I want to be your disciple... And learn the art of Curses from you... Bullshit! I do not accept disciples. Except... Those who have true wisdom. I don't know if I have this wisdom. But, I am honest and will... Work hard. I brought you some money. It is all my savings. Please accept it. Do you know... That if you learn the Curses your life will be shorted? I don't care. I will accept it the results. Forget it. Take you money and leave. Master... If you knew my life you'd take pity on me. My family is very poor... My father committed suicide... My mother worked very hard to raise me. I suffered a lot... Even my best friend bullies me. Master, he stole my girlfriend... Shut up! You really are poor. You should study hard and be a good man. You must not learn the Curses. - Now go! - Master... Please don't send me away. I came from Hong Kong to learn... - Get going! - Master! Master! Master! - Go! - Master... - Master, please let me stay! Master! - Get lost! Master... Master...Master! I don't want to go! Master! Take pity on me! Master! Master! Damn, my guts... And it's midnight... I'm so hungry. Maybe I can get a meal in my dreams. Ah Won. It's late, why are you here? I made some rice and have some here for you. Oh, rice! You can go. I'm not hungry. I spent all day making this rice. It's good, try some. But, I'm not hungry. But since you brought it. I'll taste it. It's kind of salty. But, is it good? It has a strange smell. Ah, there's hair in it! It's a edible herb, it's good for you. Edible herb? Doesn't seem like it. Why's it so curly? It's really good. It's good for your health. Young man... You really have patience. Master... I beg you... Please let me stay. You must know the Curses are only used to save people. You may not use them to cause harm. - Can you promise me this? - I promise. If you use the Curses to cause harm to people... I will not forgive you. If I do anything wrong from your teachings, I will die. Good. A Curse Master must learn how to use the Five Poisons. Follow me. You have to practise here for forty-nine days. If you can withstand the five poisons I will teach you the Curses. If you're afraid you may leave now. I won't take any money. I'm not afraid. I'm not... Stay in here. If you can't stand it leave anytime. I will leave you your meals at the door. Master, here take the money. I'm not afraid. I'm not afraid. No...I must go through with it. Even if I die. This is a powerful method of using poisons. It can completely change you. And give you the ability to become immune. In three days... You will be healed. Not bad. The results are excellent. You've been in here for 49 days. Shave your beard and take a bath. I will teach you the art of the Curse. Thank you Master. Ah Ming... I will teach you the preliminary knowledge of the Curse. First you must remember... The curse can both safe and harm people. Use it the right way... the kind way... Or your life could end. You must remember this... If you use it for evil... Your life span is reduced. And I will not forgive you and you will die a terrible death. And more importantly... My curses can only be used here in Nanyang. It has no power anywhere else. Watch carefully and follow me. - Do it. - Yes. You must concentrate and recite it continuously. Think about it and recite it. Think about it and recite it. Think about it and recite it. Stop... My disciple you have the oral wisdom. I will continue to teach you... At my side. Thank you Master! I will do everything to not ruin your trust. You really are a good disciple. From now on we are in this through thin... And thick! Why are you walking so fast? You should hurry, I don't think I can stay. I sure won't like that. My baby! My honey! My baby... My baby... Oh! I can't believe you! You came here and didn't tell me! It's none of your business. What's wrong with you? Why do hide things from me? Who are you? Why are you here? Get lost! You're the one who needs to get lost! Stop it! Stop it! You two stop it! Get out of here! Baby, are you okay? Like I told you... What I gave you was an ordinary Love Curse. You could only have his body, not his love. If you really love him... I can give you a 'Crazy Love Curse'. But, you'll have to pay for it. If I get him back... I'll pay any price. Fine. Ah Ming... You've been learning the arts, you perform the 'Crazy Love Curse'. I will watch your skill. Master, I will not disappoint you. - Lady, what's wrong? - Nothing, just bad stomach pains. Don't worry, come with me I have medicine at home. Come... Come... Careful... Sit down. - I'll get the medicine. - Hurry, it hurts! Here! - Does it hurt there? - No, higher up. - Is it here? - No, higher, higher up! Higher? Higher! Higher... Here. Thank you. Ah Doo, I can't stand it, help me! Please help me. Ah Doo, I can't live without you! Ah Doo, be with me! Ah Doo, come on be with me! Be with me! No! Just one more time! - Just once? - Yes, just once. My God... Master? Master? Master? I need another drink... Mr. Fong, your wife is on the phone. Hello. Yes, I'm heading home. Evening sir. I know I'm ugly... But, I still need love. My twin sister... Found the Curse Master. He performed the ceremony for her and she married Ah Woon. Now they are happy together. I need to meet that Curse Master. And make him love me... Ah Fong, you're back. Are you tired? Here, have a drink. I've read the report. The hotel is declining. How are you going to fix it? Father...I'm doing everything I can to make it a success. But, hotel isn't the only problem right now. I'm not the only one responsible. I don't care about that. You're the boss, fix it. Don't assume just because she's my daughter, that I'll forgive you. Father, I understand. Dad, Ah Fong works really hard. You can't put all the blame on him for the business. No good is no good. Don't make excuses. Something is wrong... Ah Fong... Don't let what he said bother you too much. You always work so hard... Ah Ling? I'm glad I hired that detective to take these photos of you cheating! What do you have to say for yourself? Speak up! - Father... - I won't listen to you! You were poor before you married... But, my daughter loved you... I let you manage one of my hotels. Divorce me daughter now! - Father, please give me a chance. - Shut up and get lost! Fine... I'm leaving. - Dad! - And don't come back! Master, thank you for the Curse. It really worked. Ah Fong loves me very much. Take the money, it's all thanks to you. Oh, I know you and your Master. Did you put a Curse on me? Yes. It was me. To tell the truth... my Curse is very powerful. You can't change it. You must treat her good. If you don't you will die horribly. Don't think of her as ugly, she'll be beautiful in your dreams. Goodbye. My family and business... I've lost it all. Why did you do this? Why did you Curse me? You forgot. I worked for you. And you said to me... That no one would ever want me. How can you forget that? And that's why I put a Curse on you. Oh, is that why you look so familiar. It's you... I remember now... That's nice. - This is our fate. - No, I must go home! We are now the same. Master... I've learned many things from you. I'm going home to see my mother. This wine is a blessing to you. Please accept this offering. I will accept this. Go home and see your mother. Mom, I'm home. Who are you? I just got back from abroad and I'm looking for my mom. She passed away, you can find her grave on the hill. Ah Wei! - Come on down! - Coming! Look, Ah Ming! - Ah Ming! - Hey! You came home! It's so nice to see you! Hey, we thought you forgot all about us. - How could I forget, I just got back. - Want to come with us? - Sure - Come on get in. So how was school? It was really very boring. So, I came back as soon as I graduated. Hey, we just got back a few days ago too. We were planning our wedding. I'm going to marry Chun Yin. Look. Congrats. Thanks. Looks like a storm's coming in, I'm cold too. Here you go. - Anything for you. - Thanks. Wei... Have you guys every heard about this place? There's a legend about all these people who drowned out here. They say their ghosts still wander around out here. Don't be scared. Ah Ming, don't try and scare her. I'm not joking. I'm just telling you the story. If I see them I'll warn you. Look, there's someone wearing white clothes! Come on, just stop it. Ah Yin, it's okay, don't be afraid. Ah Ming? Ah Ming! A ghost! A ghost! Ah Ming what happened? There's a ghost! There's a ghost! Ah Ming, come on, let me help you up. - Doctor is it serious? - It is serious. What can be done? Right now, we can only tend to his wounds. He must stay here. See the nurse to register him. What'll we do? He's been here for 2 weeks. And there's no progress in his recovery. His blood seems to be poisoned. But, we can't find what it is. He may only have a week to live. Doctor, please save his life. Ah Ming... How do you feel? I...I was seriously hurt... You'll get better. You have to hold on. - I think I'm going to die soon. - No, you'll get better... They'll save you... In Nanyang... I know a Curse Master named La Pin... He is powerful and can cure all kinds of disease. I think he can save me... - I'll go right away and find him. - I'm coming too! Thanks... Thank you... You are my saviours... Don't worry about it, just tell me how to find him. His name is La Pin... He lives in a hut in the Black Forest... Ah Ming, relax we'll go and find this Curse Master for you. Ah Ming, you'll be saved. Ah Ming, you must rest. We'll return as fast as we can. We'll get the next flight. Come on, let's go. Come on... Chun Yin... Ah Wei... I can't thank you enough... We'll see you soon as we get back. - Why'd you stop? - You have to walk the rest. - A little further. - I can't... You need to get out here. - Here's the money. - Thanks. Are we lost? Look! Maybe that's it. Are you looking for me? Are you Master La Pin? - I am. - I'm Ah Wei... - And this is Chun Yin. - Oh... From your appearance, I believe you came from Hong Kong. - What is wrong? - Do you know Ah Ming? Ah Ming... He is a good friend. He was bit by a ghost in Hong Kong. He is seriously hurt. The doctor can't tell the cause of his wound. He said he only has a week left to live. That is unfortunate. He asked us to find you. He said you can save him. Master, please can you save him? Helping people is my obligation. But, you must help me to save him. What can we do? We will do anything you say. It is very simple. I need some of your hair young lady. And some drops of blood. I can make some medicine. If he takes this medicine, he will be cured. Well? Yes, I'll do it. - Ah Wei. - Chun Yin. Okay, you can go. We are staying at the Valley Hotel. I'll tell you when the medicine is ready. Here's the key sir. Excuse me. I'm sorry. - Get out of here! Go! Go! - Chun Yin! - Chun Yin? - Get lost! Go! Get! Get out! Chun Yin! - It's you! - It's pointless trying to chase her. And you are? My name's Sofia. Your girlfriend... She has been cursed. Now only I can save her from that Curse. This is my address. Find me if you need me. Wear this God to protect yourself from the Curses of La Pin Thank you. It's useless. Chun Yin... Chun Yin... Chun Yin... Come to me! I'm waiting for you! Quick, come to me! Ah Ming! Chun Yin... I found you at last. But, your wounds. I'm fine now. So, I came to find you. I've longed for you. I thought I'd die. I love you... I've suffered so much... It nearly cost me my life. I love you so much. I'll never leave you. My dear, you will be with me forever. My soul, my body... Are yours. My love... My love... Take me... My love... My dear... I want you... My love... It's good. Good... It's so good... Who are you? You're mistaken, I don't know you. Get off... Convinced now? This woman... She's a ghost made by La Pin. She's actually dead. Now let's go to La Pin's. Someone's coming. Put on your clothes, let's go. - What should we do? - Don't worry. They won't hurt you, I'm here to protect you. Take it easy and rest over here. Ah Ming, stay with me. I won't leave. We will never separate. Like you said, we will be together forever. Stay here and don't come out. Chun Yin, I have to deal with this witch. After I kill her, we'll go far away from here. - We'll live happily together. - No, don't leave. I must go with you. You can't, she'll kill you. I'm not afraid. We will die together. Listen Chun Yin...listen. Wait here for me. Chun Yin, close your eyes. Listen... - What are you doing? - Chun Yin, forgive me. It's because I love you. I can't let you get hurt. After I kill her, I'll come get you. - Chun Yin. - Ah Ming. Please, hurry back to me. I will... Ah Ming... I'll wait for you. If you don't come back, I'll die. You aren't La Pin! Who the hell are you? Tell me! So, it's you. You're La Pin's disciple. Where's La Pin? I killed my Master... I killed him with a glass of poisoned wine. I was forced to since he tried to control everything I did, so better to kill him. You are such a wicked man. You should die for what you did to your Master. That would be justice. Ah Ming!
