WILLI TOBLER AND THE DECLINE OF THE 6TH FLEET The year 2040! There is a planet orbiting around the star Krüger 60. The galactic administration and the Supreme Command for the 6th Fleet are stationed on this planet. I crept up to the evil battle this evening with such fear My name is Dr. Willi Lerchenberg. I was born on the planet Count Grafenbeer. Count Grafenbeer is my homeland. I would naturally defend my homeland if there was a prospect of winning. I went to school on Count Grafenbeer. I studied there. I'm a cybernetic scientist. I have 20 students whom I had the privilege of teaching. I know that my planet, Count Grafenbeer, will be conquered and destroyed by one of the three galactic forces shortly. On 27 April 2040 units of the History-Destroyer Fleet lifted off from their pads in the other direction They wiped out 20 planets, including "Count Grafenbeer." In the cellars I'm married tn Dorle Steinbach. I have three children. We have to make it to the launch pad! - Grab the suitcase. Hurry! Run! Hurry to the launch pad! The engine The in 5 minutes. The engine won't start. I think it misfired. "I own a space glider." We fly to the Ashram Kanopus. I see that an enemy attack in underway on Kanopus. I can see the escape vessels, escape vessels leaving, fleeing from Kanopus. We must remain here. -Yes, let me have a look. No. Let me do this here. Let me take care of it. Now pay attention to the children and leave me Just leave me be. We're married. What more do you want? Oh, just stop that! That's enough now. You like Willi. You only have dreams. Back there! Come on. Don't make -You have to be quiet. Quiet! Be quiet back there! I've said it one hundred times! And you take care of the kids! We're in danger! I need concentrate hard in a situation like this. And don't fool around back there. They're coming! We have to go! Masked by the sun Wolf 249 escaping detection "I have relocated my family somewhere else and from now on I am named Tobler." "He who skates on thin ice will not breakthrough only if he keeps skating as fast as possible." We from the 112th "cold-blooded" 9 November 2036 We attack the planet Japetus. This is Heinz Künnecke, watchman, at the MPG for galactic science on planet Japetus. The staff has already left the institute. The bombing of planet Japetus is incessant. I am now at the large transmitter. Heinz Künnecke, watchman Asking for the constants which institute researchers were working on. Astronauts know this table equates to 54 years of scientific research. I'm considering leaving the institute. No chances of escape. The destruction is terrible. The destroyer of Japetus This is Heinz Künnicke. I'm sending the last images of our fine institute. Our conservatory, our flowers, our library, these valuable hooks. I'm standing and transmitting the last of the constants. One astronomical unit. This is the watchman at the MPG institute. The planet's being bombed incessantly. I have little time. I need to add a light year. 9.461 times 10 to the power of? cm equals 6.324 times 10 to the power 4 A.U. Dutch Schultz lost an entire division in 2031. The radius of the Milky Way system is 15,000 Masses of refugees are on the move! In the current situation of the galactic civil war I refuse to a) have a family, b) participate in research and education, c) commit myself to any cause. For this reason, I have relocated my family. I have stepped down from researching and teaching and rid myself of any commitment. In complete plasticity I am now approaching the administration planet, or the city planet, of Krüger 60. "Immediately upon landing on Krüger 60 I shall seek out the Admiral." The Admiral will respond: "Tobler, I have been awaiting you." You may, Willi Tobler. Admiral, I come from Grafenbeer. This is Bohm speaking, admiral of the 6th Fleet. The 6th Fleet has been put under my command to protect Krüger 60, the capital of the galaxy. We virtually have the control here. The quest for peace did not prevent us from ending up in chaos. We fight our comrades in the 1st Fleet and former comrades of the nomadic fleet. The History-Destroyer Fleet are coming from the rear. As High Commander of the finest force the galaxy has ever seen, I have a dilemma. The situation is hopeless. It does have one advantage. If you don't know our moves, you cannot anticipate them. Were it different, we wouldn't be at our posts much longer. Admiral of the 6th Fleet, Hugo Bohm, Command office Reporting from Grafenbeer for service on Krüger 60. As announced by telegram, I offer my services in the tertiary and quadary fields. First, I'm an information theorist. Second, a cybernetic scientist. Third, a system analyst. Fourth, a system researcher. Fifth, a prognostication, mathematician, knowledge theorist, logistician, logician, as well as practical researcher. As a practical researcher I can also take on menial jobs, particularly stress-relieving work such as washing shirts or socks, and cleaning shoes. Mr. Tobler, I did not receive your telegrams, yet I shall engage you as third press spokesman. I swear - I, Willi Tobler, swear To uphold the principles - To uphold the principles Of the constitution - Of the constitution And all deadlines. -And all deadlines unconditionally. Your task here, Admiral, is to build up a public image, an image that is belligerent, confident of success, youthful, unwavering, intrepid Yes, yes exactly. I am not against it in principle. Certainly. But I still think it is utter nonsense to hoist an admiral up on a platform and simulate a space attack. Chest out, Admiral. Chest out! Admiral, eye-catching. Admiral, face bold. Admiral, uniform. Allow me to contain your stomach some. Admiral no, no, no. Tobler, where is the camera? Admiral, crouch down tightly. Imagine yourself in a state of emergency in space. Everything depends on your skills for survival. Fire, Admiral! Fire! Admiral! Tell me what is happening, not what I should be thinking. Admiral, follow the stage directions! The mustache is perfect, but just don't purse your lips. It makes you look afraid. Open lips look belligerent. And when firing, breathe out freely, Admiral. Admiral, fire! Admiral, I thank you in the name of all our listeners, of all our brave soldiers. The conquest of new markets has brought monopolies and the 6th Fleet ever deeper into the southern Milky Way. Each year new planets are conquered. The 6th Fleet is currently planning to attack the settler planet east of Ophir. Their opponent is the 1st Fleet, which is defending the settlers. "Krüger 60 breached!" As combat reporter in the Mira sector We have to show people whatever images of space we can and these images have to show interesting events, so people at home can join in, share the experience, and identify with it in their surroundings. Ready, Willi. Time for the commentary. Please ring he“, greet, present the commentary. This is Willi Tobler speaking. "I am Paula Stihi, agent for the 1st Fleet My target is H. Bohm, Admiral of the 6th Fleet." "I'm helping the Admiral experience a third childhood." "To no avail!" Regional Cabinet meeting, Wega Sector I also welcome the representative of the minority groups. A lost world - No. - Silence! Silence. It's time for a vote now! I said silence. Gentlemen, I recommend you Thirdly, a very important method: You must act satisfyingly when you communicate with those you govern. Satisfy means you must gratify those you govern. Your message must inspire, excite, and also, once you provide inspiration through actions, with information, with communications needs, all this with satisfaction and round off all the excitement satisfactorily, with satisfaction and tranquility. A resolution in which a representative of the underprivileged planets even participated. Ladies and gentlemen, what is the reality of it? The representatives of the order convene at this table in unanimity. We see an empty table, and then nothing at all. And then we see another long table, and there at the end Gentlemen, I do not need to add anything to this description. Hymn of Wega Like the unspoiled heart of a dove, the streets look polished from above (the trucks, away the stiffs they cart and the blood is scrubbed off hard). Nannies stroll with mummy's boys Mr. Tobler, I have reports of you abusing your position as 3rd spokesman by releasing reports which cause shifts on the stock markets in the interests of a large corporation. And you received large kickbacks for doing so. I was merely cooperating with companies we know in the services of the Air Fleet. The risk bonuses and allowances Risk bonuses? You purchased a planet! But these things only happened You know I only have limited contracts for my work for our cause, and I need Working for the cause does not permit you to violate regulations. But - Not to that extent. This collaboration at your bidding extends beyond Mr. Tobler "at my bidding"! At my... at your bidding, to get information with limited means, I require certain allowances - In view of your attitude To develop my personality - Mr. Tobler, don't tell me any more. I do not wish to hear another word. - I beg for your understanding here. Mr. Tobler, you've enjoyed my understanding long enough, because I gave you that position against my beliefs. I did not only offer all my time to you, Admiral. You did not give me your time. - Rather the common cause Yes, and you have greatly damaged this common cause. I deserve some security. - Mr. Tobler, don't interrupt. Let us stop here, Mr. Tobler. I ask you to go softly on me - Go softly You know, You know how a court martial would judge your behaviour. Mr. Tobler, I ask that you be quiet! Mr. Tobler, I have decided to transfer you for disciplinary reasons to the 16th Cruiser Flotilla as sublieutenant. Admiral, I thank you. And go pack your things, Mr. Tobler. "For disciplinary reasons Willi Tobler is transferred to the Ice Belt front" "27 billion trillion miles away from Krüger 60" Units of the 6th Fleet are battling the insurgent settler-planets. The units of the settler-planets have become very menacing. I'll be happy to make it out alive. The enemy will come from the Ice Belt "How can I get myself out of this mess?" Trapped! 46th 8| 22nd light div. "We shoot like mad for a while." "I breakthrough!" "Emergency landing on Nofaru" "We stored our egg bombs here 5 years ago." "I'm being attacked I walk without shoes. You don't walk with your feet it's not merely mechanical You walk with your eyes I would say you don't walk with your eyes, you walk with your thoughts. Everything that you've learned is focused on walking I have So I don't fall or hurt myself in this situation I would've been finished I have developed a tactic for walking where I select the specific points upon which I would step. "Desert inhabitants!" Comrades, don't kill me! I'm Willi Tobler, a human in the same situation as you are. I can do more than you. I promise I will take you "I pretend to be dead." "How do I get from the enemy-held planet Jupetus across the front of the civil war." "As a stowaway in the bomb bay of an enemy ship" The spaceship isn't designed for humans. Height: 80 cm. It's not wide enough to stretch out in any direction. I must get out of here. Out! Out! It's to cramped for me in here. I want to get out of here. I can't move my feet any more. I can only move my hands. I want out! I want to get out of here! 3 million kilometres to Krüger 60! The 83rd Starfighter Cruisers "Flora" "Hornet" "Wasp" Battle cruiser "Anticipatory Dog" "Can it still fly?" "Yes." Sub-lieutenant Willi Tobler. Sub-lieutenant Tobler, I hereby appoint you captain and commander of the 6th Destroyer Flotilla. You now command 5 starships. Thank you, Admiral. Beyond the reach of both enemy and his superior, Tobler's gang eke out a living on the front-lines of Mira Norbert Nonpareil Norseman I Norseman II Nizam Hello, Willi. - Hallo, Karl. What are you doing? - I'm calculating retreats. Any interference? Do you have interference? Then via the reference system of the sun Mira to the Wega sector. We can wait there and ignite braking rockets. Hello, Karl! Hello, Karl! Willi! - Karl. -Willi. -Yes. Turn off deflectors. May/June 42 The devastation of TERRA sealed off by the 112th Fleet History-Destroyer Fleet The enemy sends 3 space tank corps through the gap. The opponent shoots into our ranks Close down weapons' systems. Space commanders Sauerwein, Angermeyer, Johnson, take the point. "The kettle allows only one means of escape" The sun Mira A ball of gas 30,000°C "Penetration of flank!" A-16 to A-17. A-16 to commander A-17. - I'm masked by Mira's shade. Surrounded by the enemy, trying to penetrate the sun's corona. Gentlemen, I can't account for my actions. I command you to pass through the sun Mira. Karl, help! Help! Help! Sauerwein, Angermeyer, Johnson, Bergler, Gundlach, Berteaux, help! Help, help, help Help. Help me. Help me. 80 km into the sun Karl, help me. Help. We're through or we're melting! Help, help! "Through!" Assemble. Sauerwein, Angermeyer, Johnson, Bergler, Gundlach, comrades. I am ready to answer for myself before a court-martial. Space commanders, form up for departure to Krüger 60. Long live the president! Switching to space division frequency. "The experts will be amazed "The day on which there were no executions The insurgents are blowflies. My troops are special units. My ideal plan is to move troops on the field with the tenderness of a masseur. I permit the special unit leaders 1. To withdraw 2. To arrest 3. To decimate Reporting for duty as announced by telegraph. Permit me to point out that although I have seen much and survived many tough situations, I have not faltered one centimeter from the government's principles, my experiences or contemplations. "I re-appoint you, Willi Tobler, 3rd press spokesman." H. Bohm, Chief Admiral My dear viewers Attention, Willi. Rolling. Rolling in 3 seconds. This is Willi Tobler speaking. Good morning, ladies and gentlemen. I come to you from the south galaxy. Good morning, ladies and gentlemen. I come to you from the south galaxy. Good day, ladies and gentlemen. I come to you from the south galaxy. Please say today's message, Willi. Off. Cannae Cannae, flank attack, flank technique. The high art This is Willi Tobler speaking. The high art of the flank attack is used by field commanders. You see it often in the history of war and also in our stratospheric campaigns. Right flank, left flank, and then they're trapped. Differentiation in military strategy is the flank attack. A good flank attack doesn't happen in the center but materialises from the right or left side, unexpectedly, progressing toward the enemy. Ladies and gentlemen, a flank attack is the creativity of the art of war. 6th Fleet heading toward Sledged Onions. Victory over Sledged Onions! "The front ranks of the 6th Fleet conquer Ophir" 14 January 2042 6th Fleet attacks the settler planets Remaining forces form defense lines. "I order the attack on Feodor Liedke!" Mr Bodenheim, I repeat: let the 3rd Division - in the early morning at the city limits of Feodor Liedke. Are we ready? Good morning, listeners. Good morning, ladies and gentlemen. Coming to you from the south galaxy, this is Willi Tobler. There are minority systems that have called our actions "acts of war". This is Willi Tobler speaking to you from the south galaxy. We are on We are close to the sun Mira and are observing the interesting formations of spaceship fleets. "We advance no further at the city limits of Feodor Liedke." "Occupying the edge of Feodor Liedke, the 6th Fleet is under attack." "Our leadership expects: tanks" We land! Briefing with the Chief of Staff: von Carlowitz Admiral, please look to the left. You'll see we are running thin there. The enemy has sliced us in half. On the left here appears to be a reconnaissance unit which wants to move to the front. Continuing. Time will tell. I don't think we will last more than 3 days. The enemy has cut through in the middle with a very fast spearhead and forced a retreat. We are fighting while retreating. Placing ourselves at the enemies' head we fight our way backwards, with forward swordplay, going backwards. With one last effort, we try to hold back the enemy and cut him off at the front line. I don't know if it will work. He has passed us without knowing that we are still inside. We'll now try to quietly retreat to the right to lure our enemy into the offside trap. If you pay careful attention here to how the left flank looks above. Even our front ranks are surrounded, the front ranks of the retreat. Admiral, may l sum it up for the report? In Area 1, fighting. In Area 2, combat situations of varying degrees in different positions. -Yes, sir. And in Area 3, which you haven't yet mentioned, may l say victory But it is clear we can escape. Victory. - Victory. That means victory. That means victory. -Yes, sir. I like the order. But it can be changed at anytime. The front ranks of the 6th Fleet are surrounded and have surrendered. "The old outhouse is in flames. The ass is in danger. We are the men with the hoses. Hurrah, the fire brigade is here." Now comes vengeance. Retaliation. It means war, gentlemen. Admiral Bohm: "In this case we will use biochemical weapons." "We will jettison dark clouds in front of the sun to supercool the planet" Police File for professional criminals 'The Life Of An Elephant' by the author of 'The Life Of A Bear' "To feel like a new man high up in the celestial sky in uncharted lands. Roaring past the lips, Up goes the ship!" "Silent is the house of ill-repute, the whores are resting, A horny toad is in the salon The madame scratches her heinie On the mullion hangs balloon. Do you like my song? - Very expressive. Will the comrades like it? - Downright effective. I truly enjoy seeing it spread around the table. I think the whole room will sing it. I need to get out of here. My legs are tingling. They're asleep. I need some movement. I need to walk. Unfortunately the troops began to rebel in droves. Mr. Tobler, what shall we do? Think of something. Look to the left. The space ships are dancing around like bluebottles. 21 January 2043 "The Chief of Staff just manages to escape from his own convoy." Tobler, listen. What's going on? Listen, what's going on? The wrong program Interference from the enemy. Our vehicles were misled on purpose. We have to intervene, or everything will fall apart. But what enemy would that be, Admiral? We have triumphed over our last enemy. Yes, in principle we have no enemies. I don't get it either. We have conquered all enemies, yet here they are. You must try to control the upper ranks. The individual ships aren't important for our job here. I've lost contact to the command fleet. I don't know It seems the entire fleet is disintegrating. They're zipping around from left to right down there. And I thought it was the opposite way around. We need to advance to Krüger 60, Admiral. I have a date on Krüger 60 tonight. And what about my date at the station on Krüger 60 tonight? We'll tell Command Central - Inform the Major. A direct order: Advance to Krüger 60. Save yourselves! Fleets 1 and 3. Fleets 1 and 3, listen to my orders! The admirals have been stripped of power. I command you to advance to Krüger 60. General Dr. Wetland, have the Major wait for me at 18:00. You're responsible for my sexual field rations! Call Kautschke! - No. Call Kautschke! - No, he is a traitor. Call Kautschke. He has the ray. - Bring the commanders! You fink! Who got you in the military? You're a failure through and through. Everything must go by my command. - Calm yourself. You must remain subjective - Oh, you slow-worm! You bore me. I'll have your head. - Drive back your subjectivity. Call each and every commander. - I have already informed them. They will meet with me at dusk. They'll hear from me! Call each and every one of them. I've lost radio contact. Switch over to the secret frequencies. - I can't do that either. This is Rear Admiral v. Carlowitz, Chief of Staff of the 6th Fleet. Ladies and gentlemen, our troops have not mutinied. I bid you to stay calm. It is only galactic interference. Our opponent may have a hand in it too. Impossible! We have no opponents. We vanquished them all. Have faith in us and our command. You have - I only have 5 trustworthy generals. Call them all. - Koppermann, Uhlig, Böttcher, Homm, Henkel and Wetland. And Knautschke is very important. - Knautschke is a traitor. But he knows the way through to Krüger 60. We'll only get to the Command post - I don't want to hear his name again! Knautschke controls the Major. 50 call him. I can deal with him. You stand back. -Yes, save the Major. Major Paula Stihi "I am an agent." "I disclose what I learn to the enemies of the Admiral." "I do love him so, and I have valid reasons for it." "He discovered who I really am and didn't betray me" Comrade Zack Weber died here on Planet Caymann "I am Chief Justice Davis" My fact-finding mission: War crimes of the 6th Fleet When I die, it cannot be by chance. "Chief Justice Davis died while cleaning his weapon" "Funeral transport to Krüger 60" A military strategy of Justice Davis! Chief Justice Davis presses charges! I've really had to fight my way through. But everything has worked out well. One needs to unload some ballast at times, but something new always comes along. Often it's more interesting than the old thing. You actually improve yourself even if, we" Often you think you've gotten worse, but you've actually got better. Actually I'm doing quite well. I get around quite a bit and I'm free. No one can order me around. They can think they can, but it's not so. I need to decide by 16:00 on which side of the civil war I stand. So I've started to study philosophy. In extreme situations of danger I retreat to the libraries and study the basics. Books that I didn't get to read in the last 30 years. "I choose the side of those in power!" The victors do not want to have Willi Tobler as spokesman. Weitling, I can't go on. I won't be made out to be a criminal. I need a mission. I won't let myself I won't let myself be made inferior. You must help me, so the revolutionary government helps me. You have contacts. You're mistaken. It is not a revolutionary government. There is no government. Period. Those conditions you assumed are gone. There is nothing more to do. You must go. Go. You must leave the planet. Help me. I need a mission. Without a doubt. I can't go to the hospital. I'd go crazy on the isolation ward. You won't go mad. There are only 2 options. Either - I want to remain in the fray. You cannot. You must understand that. You must see the situation. Your time in the limelight is over. I really need a job. I need afield of activity. And I'll do anything put my way. Okay. Fine. Go to the provinces. Take a ship, a small one. Take some propaganda material with you and go deep into the provinces. Yes. One thing is crystal clear. If you stay in the limelight, if you try to stick around I want to try to. I want to be a part of it. They'll beat you. Beat you to death. Is it that serious? -Yes. Agreed? -You must help Do you agree? - Help me. I'll do anything. I'll leave. Anything but the isolation ward. You can come on the information tour with me. We'll travel together. Okay? Thank you, Weitling. Aboard the propaganda ship "Ursus" The transfer of power served to shed light on war crimes. The victors pulled out after 100 days. "Tobler is on the wrong side!" I try to dispose of the pamphlets on the information ship. "The material cannot be cast off!" Willi Tobler. - Occupation? Spokesman for the 6th Fleet. - Former spokesman. I am the chief inspector. Anything you say can and will be used against you. I must say I've worked for the government for 30 years. If I am to be punished for such a small blunder, I will reject any praise from the government in the future. You are accused of collaborating with the 100-day revolutionary committees. I was drawn into it by a close friend. You attempted to destroy incriminating evidence on your ship. Those materials were insignificant. It was propaganda. We have confiscated it as evidence. I refuse to comment on that. This is pointless! Last name? - Weitling. Occupation? - Assistant secretary. Please remove your glasses. Sign here. Sadism leads to fascism. And I'm beginning to see where sadism comes from. The symbol of intelligence is the snail's shell. With its feeling face it also smells, if you care to believe Mephistopheles. WILLI TOBLER AND THE DECLINE OF THE 6TH FLEET Forward!
