Where am I? (SCOFFS) 6th and Washington. Right. 6th and Washington. Got it. Is there anything else? Yeah. Can I get back in? Oh, God. Fine. Yes. Thank you, thank you. Okay, so can you give me a ride back to the tour bus? Do I look like a taxi service? No, but you look like a pizza delivery service. So if I order pizza, can't you just deliver me with it? (SIGHS) Okay. Yay! (ENGINE STARTS) (SIGHS) (SIGHS) Great. Why don't you just call them? Yeah. This is so weird. What? This has never happened before. What, you've never been on your own? I mean, no, not that. I mean, just... They probably have no idea that I'm not on the bus. Usually they always know where I am. Well, congrats on having a new life experience. I'm sure it'll be just thrilling for you. So are you gonna call them or not? (SIGHS) No. Actually, no, I'm not. Why not? I mean, they're already on their way to Vegas. My mom's probably asleep. What's the point? (SIGHS) I can probably just get a flight tomorrow or something. (SCOFFS) Must be nice. Yeah. So what, do you want me to take you to a hotel or something? Eh... Hotels can be pretty tricky. Once they know who I am, word gets out, that's just a pain. Plus, I don't have my security. Right. Yeah. So where do you want me to take you? Well, don't you live around here? Yeah, why? No! Come on, why not? Are you insane? I'm not gonna bring you home with me. Come on, I got to sleep somewhere. I can crash on your couch. (GASPS) What am I gonna tell my parents? You don't tell your parents. Even better. Come on, they'd insist on calling my mom or whatever. It's too awkward. And sneaking you into my bedroom late at night isn't? I'll pay you. $100. $200. I said no! $500. $500 cash, I'll be gone first thing. Come on, you could obviously use the money. (SCOFFS) Excuse me? You deliver pizzas. So? So, I assume it's not for fun. Come on, $500 cash, I'll be gone first thing. What do you say? One night. I'll be gone by morning. And you sleep on the floor. Perfect. So, do we have a deal? Deal. I'm Jordan. Emily. Emily. So... What now? Well, my shift's almost over, but it's gonna be hours before my parents go to bed. So we're gonna have to kill some time. Okay. So... What do you want to do? You tell me, you're the one who lives here. (SCOFFS) I don't know. I mean, do you know any places where I won't get recognized? (UPBEAT INSTRUMENTAL MUSIC) All right. It's on like Donkey Kong. Okay. Thank you. All right. Why does it keep going left? (LAUGHS) So good. It's crazy. It's been like 10 years, cut me some slack. All right. Okay. Looks like you come here often. I didn't see it. I didn't see it. Okay. EMILY: All right, all right. Round two. Round two, here we go. Let's see. (LAUGHS) I think I'm being hustled. (SCOFFS) So I'm guessing bowling really isn't the popular sport around here. (LAUGHS) Yeah, definitely not. It's, uh... It's why I like it. What do you mean? (BREATHES DEEPLY) It's just nice to have someplace to get away. You know? Someplace that's just yours. Don't have to deal with people and all their stuff. All right, I can feel that. So, what about you? What do you like to do for fun? I don't know. Video games, I guess. You know, I'm mostly working, so I don't get to go out much. How is that possible? (CHUCKLES) Hmm? I mean, you... You're a celebrity. So? So I'm pretty sure that means you can do whatever you want. It's not as easy as it looks, trust me. Come on. It really can't be that bad. All right, well, not necessarily bad, just... I don't know, I started performing when I was really young. Singing, auditioning, taking classes. I had a manager when I was eight. So that doesn't really leave time for me to do, you know, normal stuff. Right. Well, did you want to do all that, or were you, you know, like, forced into it? No, I wanted it. Like, I definitely wanted it. And you know, my mom was a little reluctant at first, but I practically begged her every single day, and she eventually made it happen for me. Well, that's nice. That she cared that much. Oh, yeah. (SIGHS) My career is her whole life. So I can never really complain. You know? I'm the kid that's gotten everything he's ever wanted. You know, not many people can say that. Yeah, that's for sure. (SCOFFS) Enough about me, though. What about you? What about me? I mean, all I know is that, you know, you're in high school, you live with your parents, and you deliver pizzas. Oh, don't forget about all the bowling. Ah! Yes. Never forget about the bowling. (LAUGHS) But seriously, what's your story? I don't have a story. Oh, come on. Everybody has a story. Not really. No. Um... Family? Two parents, only child. Friends? Well, I'm in high school. So... Mmm. Unless I want to get wasted every weekend and see how many guys I can hook up with, (CHUCKLES) yeah, um, my options are pretty limited. Okay. Um. Oh. Movie? Favorite movie? I prefer reading. Okay, favorite book? Who can pick only one? Oh, my God. Now you're just being stubborn. No, not really. Look, not everyone started working when they were eight. It's... It's great that you have it all figured out for yourself, but don't assume everyone else does. Nobody has it all figured out. Believe me. (WHISPERING) Go through my window, it's the second one. I'll let you in. (WHISPERING) Okay. (DOG BARKING IN DISTANCE) JORDAN: (SOFTLY) Oh... Whoa! This is awesome. Is this yours? Uh... Yeah. Okay, I am impressed. It's really not that good. Oh, come on. I'm still working on it. What do you mean, you don't have a story? I don't know. You know what it's like to put your art out there. (SCOFFS) I do not make art. Let me just grab you a blanket and a pillow. So is this what you want to do? Yeah. Um... I got accepted into a bunch of art schools. It's not cheap. I've been saving forever, but I still need a scholarship, which is kind of complicated. Why? Um. It all depends on my portfolio. It's not just about technique. Kind of art I'm into, it's a little hard to show. How so? (CHUCKLES) You got plenty around here. Um. So this is street art, right? My room doesn't count. I mean, the whole point of this style is to take everyday objects like walls and settings, and change them. You know, make art a part of everyday life. Not just stuck in a museum or a gallery. That's really cool. Yeah, except for the part where it's illegal. (CHUCKLES) I live in a small town, and my dad's a cop. Kind of limits my options. (SIGHS) Um... I, uh... I need to get changed. Oh, right. I'll just turn around. Uh... No, you can go in there. The closet, like right there? Yeah. That'd be great. That works, too. Just... Yeah. (CHUCKLES) (EMILY SIGHS) Wow! Nice closet. EMILY: (LAUGHS) Sorry. I've never had a boy in my room, okay? Let alone a celebrity. It's kind of weird. JORDAN: Well, congrats on having a new life experience. (CHUCKLES) (EXHALES) Okay, you can come out now. You... You good? Yep. JORDAN: Hey. You awake? (SOFTLY) Yeah. What's wrong? Nothing. (BREATHING DEEPLY) I can't sleep. Seriously? Can you? No. I know, right? Sometimes... Sometimes when I can't sleep, I like to just... Listen to the quiet. It's like the whole world stops just a few hours. Like... Like time is frozen. Yeah. Gets me thinking. About what? Life. Like how... I don't know. How nothing is really real. Who we are, who people think we are... How it just seems so fake. 'Cause at the end of the day... It doesn't really matter, you know? I know that doesn't make any sense. No, I get it. (EXHALES) My whole life is like that. People always tell me what to wear, and what to do, and say. All day, every day. And somebody is always watching. I always have to be careful, you know. So this is the only time that's really mine. Maybe that's why I can't sleep. Yeah. I mean... Just the other day you were this guy on the radio. Now, (CHUCKLES) you're lying on my floor... And that should be weird, but it's not. Not really. 'Cause at the end of the day, you're just a guy. Gee, thanks. You know what I mean. (EXHALES) Yeah, I do. (EXCLAIMS) What the heck? Oh, my God. It wasn't a dream. (YAWNS) Where am I? My bedroom floor. Your bedroom? Mmm-hmm. Right. God, you scared the heck out of me. Then we're even. Hi. Hey. (BOTH CHUCKLE) Wait, crap. What time is it? I don't know. Maybe like 8:00? I got to call my mom. Yeah, and we got to get you out of my house. Do you think your parents are awake yet? Definitely. What are we gonna do? Um... Let me get changed. I have an idea. (YAWNING) Okay. (SNIFFS) Yeah. I know, she's a real firecracker, that one. Yeah, I told her green and she went white. She's a funny one. Go out the window and be quiet. I'm gonna distract them. KAREN: No, I didn't get that from her. I think they said France, but... I don't know. Hey. Yeah, I just... I just have no clue which direction she's gonna go with that. Good morning. What? Trish, hang on one second. Honey, do you want some oatmeal? EMILY: Uh... No. I... No. What are you guys doing today? (LAUGHING) Hello? What? Really? When was the last time we had a real conversation? Or had a meal together, or talked about anything other than what we had to do that day? I mean, when was the last time that I saw you without your phone glued to your hand? It's just work, you know this. (SCOFFS) I mean, in, like, six months, I am gone. I leave for college. And who knows how much we'll see each other after that. So you can decide what's important. Just think about it, okay? What do you think that was all about? (CELL PHONE RINGING) (RINGING STOPS) Do you want some oatmeal? JORDAN: (CHUCKLES) That was awesome. I'm horrible. No, you're not. You told the truth. It was inspiring. I've never spoken to them like that before. I mean, was it for distraction, or did you mean it? Both. Okay, so you have nothing to feel bad about. Yeah, well, let's not waste it. We got to get you to the airport. Yeah, about that. What? Well, my show isn't till tomorrow night, so technically I don't have to fly out today. So what, you just want to stay here? Well, I mean, I didn't plan all of this. It's just... I actually kind of like it. It's kind of like a little vacation. Hanging out at a bowling alley and sleeping on my floor. I mean, no managers, no security, no press, no screaming fans. Fair enough. This is the most normal I've felt in years. So what do you say? Got any plans? Me? Uh, not really. Well, then, do you want to hang? Sure, I guess. Awesome. There's one thing I got to take care of real quick, and then we're good to do whatever. What's that? MRS. JAYE: And then this morning, I thought maybe he went out for breakfast, but then he hasn't come back. And I can't imagine that he would decide now in his life to take off, when he's a major superstar, and that's why I'm so concerned... (CELL PHONE VIBRATING) Oh! Hello? JORDAN: Hey, Mom. Jordan? Yeah, it's me. Are you all right? Yes, I'm fine. Everything's okay. Oh... What happened? You just disappeared. Your GPS is off. What... I know. I turned it off. What? Why? Look, I'll explain everything later. I'll fly back in tomorrow, just in time for the show. No, no. That is unacceptable. You do not get to... Relax, okay? I said I'm fine. I'll check in later. Jordan, don't you dare. You need... How'd she take it? (EXHALES) As well as could be expected. (SIGHS) He's okay. He's okay, everybody. He's okay. Officer, thank you for your time. Apparently, my son has taken off and we'll see him tomorrow. Want to grab some food? Um, yeah. I could eat. Come on. My treat. But first, I feel like I should get new clothes. (CHUCKLES) Yeah. (BLOWS RASPBERRY) (BOTH CHUCKLE) Oh, my God. I can barely recognize you. Yeah, well, that's my image. Why? Well, because for some reason, teenage girls seem to like it more. And that's who buys my albums and my tour tickets. Well, I don't get it. That right there is how I got caught last night. I was just standing here when some girls happened to come by. (LAUGHS) Are you serious? Oh, my God. That's perfect. What? Poor things were probably so confused. Hey, don't talk about my fans like they're idiots. And don't say that they're idiots because they like me. Fine. But I will point out that you literally ran away from them. Oh, come on. They were just a little too enthusiastic. Sometimes they don't understand the concept of personal space. It's because they feel like they know the real me. Is that weird? What? People, like, these random strangers acting like they know everything about you. Intimate detail. Oh, yeah. Definitely weird. They feel like they know the real Jordan Jaye, but they don't. Just what some press agent decided was good for my image, AKA not me. Really? Really. Okay, favorite color. Is it A, blue, B, green, or C, orange? JORDAN: I guess, A, blue. (MIMICS BUZZER) Sorry. The correct answer is C, orange. (CHUCKLES) Like a sunset. "Like a sunset"? Mmm-hmm. I don't know where they get this stuff from. Well, if Jordan Jaye is one thing, it's romantic. Yeah, next. Okay, here's the big one. It's the final question. "What is Jordan Jaye's favorite movie?" Is it A, The Avengers, B, Maze Runner, or C, oh, The Notebook. (BOTH CHUCKLE) Um, I'm gonna have to go with D, none of the above. Sorry, that's not an option. Try again. Please tell me it's not C. Mmm. I can't do that. (SIGHS) Wow. So according to the Jordan Jaye compatibility quiz, you are... "Strangers in the night. "You have nothing in common." (LAUGHS) Is that what it says? Yeah. What are the other choices? Um... "Facebook friends," and "Match made in heaven." Yeah, I feel dirty. You're right, though, they know nothing about you. Told you. Oh! What? No! What? Get under the table. Ow! What was that for? Do it! Now! What are you... What, now? Yes! (PLATES CLATTERING) JORDAN: Ow! God! (SIGHS) What is your problem? Nothing. Really? Then can you please stop staring at me and my friends with your judgy look all over your face? Don't flatter yourself. What are you doing here, Jessica? You don't own the place, Emily. Well, no, but I didn't think you came here anymore. Why wouldn't I come here? It's adorable. I don't know, it's not the popular place to hang out. There's no one to show off to. Thought that's all that mattered to you. Wow. Wow. You are pathetic. Sitting there, thinking that you are just so much better than everyone else. Well, at least I don't pretend to be someone I'm not. Oh. Well, at least people know I actually exist. God, do you really think that you're gonna just go to New York and be this, like, great artist? 'Cause that's hilarious. Hilarious. Because you're a nobody. And you will be a nobody no matter where you go. So I'm gonna come here whenever I want, and if you don't like it, how about you go find somewhere else to judge people from? Okay. Yeah. Lot of calories on that table, Emily. Lot of calories. Okay, she's gone. Get up. Friend of yours? Yeah, believe it or not, she used to be. Gosh. Uh, so what's with all the hostility, then? Uh, she wanted to be popular. I didn't care. She changed, wanted everyone else to like her, and when I didn't, she dropped me. (SCOFFS) Ah. Now I get why you want to get out of here so bad. Yeah. You know what? Let's get you out of here before someone recognizes you. Maybe there's like a back door or something. Or, we could just do this. What are you doing? (SOFTLY) I got this. I got this. (SIGHS) Hi. I'm Jordan Jaye. Yeah, I know. Great. That'll save us some time. Okay, so here's the thing. I happened to see some of Emily's artwork on Instagram, and I was just blown away. You don't see that type of talent every day, am I right? Of course I'm right. Anyway, I came here hoping to convince her to, you know, design my next album cover. But apparently, she's not a fan. Doesn't want to "compromise her artistic integrity." But, you being a friend of hers, I was hoping you might want to help convince her. What do you say? (CAMERA CLICKING) Can I see that? Thank you. Wouldn't want to be getting sued, huh? Come on, we're leaving. What? What? Come on, I was making a friend. Was that... Why was he... That was... Ugh. What the heck were you thinking? (LAUGHS) What? She deserved it. I thought you wanted to keep a low profile. Now everyone's gonna know you're here. Oh, come on. Who's gonna believe her? And if they do, I'll be long gone by then, relax. You're... You're unbelievable. Come on. You're welcome. And besides, don't listen to her. Come on, your stuff is great. More people need to see it. Not someday, not in college, right here, right now. Let's tag the school tonight. (LAUGHS) What? No! No, I'm not gonna break into my own school. Come on, come on. Let's make 'em eat their words. You... You are crazy. Just crazy enough. Oh, come on. How would we even get in? I'll take care of it. What if we get caught? We won't get caught. Come on, live a little. Isn't that what art's all about? Real life, real emotions. Well, this is it. Come on, let's be in this moment. What do you say? Okay, we're gonna need supplies. Great, there you go. There you go. (ELECTRONIC MUSIC PLAYING) EMILY: Look for spray paint. JORDAN: Gotcha. Yeah, it would look great. Ooh, this would be a good idea. EMILY: Oh, yeah. So we don't die. Good thinking. I think so. (LAUGHING) Oh, they saw me. JORDAN: Come on, let's go. So, your parents aren't around much, huh? Uh, no. Not really. That a good thing or a bad thing? Mmm... Neither. I don't know. They're not bad parents, they're just busy. Must be nice. My mom is always around. Why? She's my manager. (LAUGHS) Like a mom-ager? (LAUGHS) Exactly. Hmm. I don't know. Sometimes I wish she was just my mom. She push you a lot? Yeah, but it's 'cause she thinks I want it. You don't? Hold on. What? (CAR APPROACHING) Uh, I think my parents are home. Okay, um, just get in the house. I'll... Dang it. There's that... Hi. Hey, Em. Oh, hi, sweetie. What are you guys doing home? We're making dinner. We're gonna sit down and eat together as a family. Like tonight? Yes, tonight. (LAUGHS) Your father and I talked about what you said earlier, and you're right. Yeah. We should have more time together, away from phones and work. (CHUCKLES) Uh... That's great, but could we maybe do this like, tomorrow night? I thought that... Oh, it's just, um... What, do you have plans? Well... (DOORBELL RINGS) Hello. Hi, Mr. Lowe. I've heard a lot about you. I'm Jay. I'm a friend of Emily's. Emily. Your... Hey, Jay. Hi, Emily. Oh, thank you. Um... As I was saying, me and Jay were gonna hang out for a bit tonight, so... Yeah, she was helping me out with art class. KAREN: Richard, who's at the... Oh, hello. Hi. Honey, this is Jay. Nice to meet you. Nice to meet you, too. Anyway, Jay, um, my parents wanted to have dinner tonight, so... Oh, we didn't know that you had plans. Oh. EMILY: Well... Why don't you join us for dinner? Oh, Mom. No, he doesn't... JORDAN: I'd love to. Have a bite, and then you guys can take off. Okay. Sure. So, are you, uh... You two... Oh! No. No. Dad, no. That's ridiculous. (CHUCKLES) Just checking. Yeah. Yeah. Okay. Richard, why don't we go get dinner started? (JORDAN LAUGHS) What are you thinking? What? It's just dinner. What if they recognize you? They won't. (LAUGHS) You look very familiar. Um, maybe you saw him at my school. Maybe. I get that a lot. I kind of have that face. Oh, the food is amazing, by the way. You guys are really good cooks. Well, thank you, Jay. We don't get a chance to very often, but hopefully that's gonna change. (CHUCKLES) So you two go to the same school? Yeah. Yep. Same school. We share art class together. She's really good. KAREN: Are you into the same kind of art as Emily? Oh, no. I'm nowhere near as good as her. She's really talented. She could be the next Banksy. Who? Banksy. He's a street artist who puts art and stuff up on buildings, public buildings. Public buildings? Illegally, I'm assuming. Well, yeah, but most people would kill to have him paint on their building. I mean, he's famous. Does gallery shows, sells tons at auction, even has a documentary written about him. It was actually nominated for an Oscar. Oh, really? Yeah. He's a celebrity. And the best thing about his work is that it always says something. That's why he does it in public. 'Cause it always has a message. And I think Emily could be just as great. Thank you. Jay. Anyways, I'm more into music. (SIGHS) Really? Yep. Is that what you want to do, you want to be a musician? Maybe. I thought so at first, but I'm not so sure right now. You know, I used to have a band back in college. Dad... What? I did. And Jay, I got to be honest with you, it can be a real struggle. I mean, there's a lot of competition out there, so if that's what you want to do, you better be sure about it. The same thing we say to Emily. Oh, come on, Richard. Don't discourage him. I'm not. Babe, all I'm saying is if that's what he wants, it should be for the right reasons. It shouldn't be about fortune or fame, or anything like that. It should be about the music. And if only a dozen people were to hear him play, it's enough. 'Cause he has something to say. I'll be sure to keep that in mind. Okay. Got some of my old CDs laying around from back in the day, if you want to go check 'em out. We really got to get going. Let's do it! Of course. Come on. (SIGHS) Just, hey, 10 minutes and then we can do whatever, okay? He's adorable. Mom! Stop. I already told you, it's... It's not like that. Not yet. Look, I'm pretty sure he has a girlfriend. Pretty sure, or absolutely sure? I don't know. Well, maybe you should ask him. Mom! No. It doesn't matter. I'm going off to New York. He's going off to, like, travel. It's just not gonna happen. Would it be the worst thing in the world if something did? There's no such thing as the right time. Baby, life doesn't come with guarantees. Every now and then, you just have to take a chance. Think about it. Okay. We got to go. Dad! It's getting late. (LAUGHING) I do not understand you. What? I'm a parent kind of guy. Thanks for what you said in there. It was true. (LAUGHS) I can't believe you did that. (LAUGHS) What? It was fun. Your mom and dad are great. Now, are you excited to do this or what? Yeah, you're the one who wanted dinner. All right, let's go. Let's do this. Okay. Now I'm officially a criminal. What's the worst that could happen? This is such a bad idea. You keep saying that. Relax. Okay, where should we start? This way. EMILY: It's so weird being here at night. JORDAN: It's weird being here at all. I don't think I've ever been inside of a high school. Makes me wonder, you know, what it would have been like if I had never gotten famous. EMILY: Yeah, life is full of what-ifs. Yeah, like, maybe I would have been in the school choir, singing songs, dreaming of stardom. Maybe. Or maybe you'd be like one of those guys who says he's "in a band," and he plays three chords, two songs, and plays at parties to get with girls. (LAUGHS) Don't say that to your dad. Please. Who do you think told me? So, ever wonder if you should have done things differently? Yeah, sometimes. But I don't know, it's a tradeoff. Like, maybe I'd still be friends with Jessica, but then I wouldn't be focused on my art. Wouldn't be going to New York. Wouldn't have met you. And I definitely wouldn't be doing this. Okay. Here. (SIGHS) Cool. EMILY: (SIGHS) Okay. (ROUSING INSTRUMENTAL MUSIC) Nice. What's next? I don't think I could do it. I mean, putting my own art out there is nerve-wracking enough. Performing live? I'd get stage fright. Eh. You get used to it. Do you like it? Singing in front of tens of thousands of fans? Mmm. Yes and no. Come on, it's got to be pretty cool. All those people listening to what you have to say. Cheering for you. Yeah, but that's just the thing. They're not actually cheering for me. (SIGHS) I have this whole team of professionals that choose what I wear, what I sing... Everything. (SIGHS) I'm just playing a part. So? I mean, not all singers write their own songs. That's true. But at least they get to pick their own songs. When I first started out, I didn't just want to be a singer. I wanted to express myself through music. Well, then, why don't you change it? It's not that easy. Sure it is. I mean, you already have a huge audience. Just make the kind of music you want to make. Maybe I don't have anything to say. I don't believe that. Maybe no one will like it. (SIGHS) Well, I think as long as you like it, that's all that really matters. I guess. You know, there are so many people out there just desperately trying to get noticed. Instead of feeling trapped, you should try and see this as an opportunity. (LAUGHS) Life doesn't come with guarantees. Sometimes you just have to take a chance. (SIGHS) Come on. We're not done yet. Number 22, Jordan Jaye with the game-winning shot. Ah! Ah! You are such a dork. (CHUCKLES) All right. Where are we doing this? Right here. We're gonna need more light, though. I got it. Hey, what's this? (ELECTRONIC MUSIC PLAYING) JORDAN: Whoa. Okay, this is awesome. Why is this happening? It's left over from homecoming. Come on, let's try it out. (LAUGHS) No. Oh, come on. Why not? I don't dance. Yes, you do. Everyone dances. No, you don't understand. I literally cannot dance. Come on. Anybody can dance. You just got to try. Just got to get in the groove. Get into it. Got to get into the rhythm, you know? Little groove? There you go. See, baby steps. It's all in the hustle. (LAUGHS) So bad. There you go. See? There you go, you got it. I knew you had it in you. (LAUGHS) (SOFT MUSIC PLAYING) (SIGHS) (LAUGHS) Come on. Coward. Oh, my God. Fine. (LAUGHS) I guess this isn't so bad. Not much of a school dance type girl, are you? Bunch of drunk teenagers acting stupid and hooking up? No, thanks. I think it sounds kind of fun. Okay, then you can go. Maybe I will. Sure. Seriously. When's your next dance? I don't know, prom. Perfect. I'll come by after tour, swing by and could be your date. Sounds fun, right? Jordan... What? Stop. Stop what? Let's not do this. I have no idea what you're talking about. Let's not pretend like we're gonna see each other after this. Why not? 'Cause it's just not gonna happen. So you're telling me after all this, it's just over? Yeah. Why wouldn't it be? Why are you being like this? Being like what? Realistic? (SCOFFS) God, we just met like two days ago, Jordan. (MUSIC STOPS) I'm going off to school, you have a life to get back to. It's just not gonna happen. Maybe I'm not going back. Of course you are. You're not stupid enough to throw it all away. Look, you're just bored and you're unhappy, and you're using me as an excuse to not deal with it. But I'm just some girl who gave you a ride. And in a week from now, it'll be like this never happened, okay? And that's... That's fine with me. So you didn't feel anything? That's not the point. Uh, yeah, it kind of is. (SNIFFLES) Don't you have a girlfriend? What? No. Oh, really? Then what about Nikki Brown? Did you google me? Do not change the subject. No, okay. We dated for like five minutes, but it's over. All right? Our managers set us up, and she still acts like we're dating for publicity reasons. And that was okay with you? I didn't think it mattered. (SCOFFS) See, this is exactly what I'm talking about. Celebrity ex-girlfriends, and managers, and publicity. You're a part of this whole other world, and I am just me. And that's totally fine, seriously. (SOFTLY) Can we please just do this and get out of here? Yeah. (SOFT INSTRUMENTAL MUSIC) Look. I'm sorry. I don't know why I got like that. No, I'm sorry. I shouldn't have put you on the spot. You were just being nice. I'm the one who got all serious. No, but you're right. We did just meet. I don't know, I just... I was having such a fun time. Got carried away. Me, too. I mean, I've had a... I've had a really great time. And what you've done for me, I'm really grateful. Don't be. I got just as much out of all this as you did. Maybe more. Okay. So we're good? We're great. Great. Hey, what time is it? Looks like after 6:00. Come on. Something I want to show you. (SOFT INSTRUMENTAL MUSIC) Car should be here soon. (SIGHS) So, what's after Vegas? Chicago, I think. I don't actually know. What about after the tour's over? Not sure. (EXHALES) So I was thinking about what we talked about earlier. Yeah? I think I'm gonna try a different approach. See what happens. (LAUGHS) That's great. Yeah. For the first time in a long time, I feel pretty great. Kind of like anything's possible. So what about you? What do you think's gonna happen on Monday? (BREATHES DEEPLY) I have no idea. I don't really care. I just know things are gonna be different. I think that's all that matters. (EXHALES) Listen, this has been one of the best times I've had in a long, long time. I'm not gonna forget it in a week. Yeah, me either. Give me your phone. (CHUCKLES) Okay, this is my number. All right? Like, no one has this number. (CHUCKLES) I want to hear everything that happens, okay? Okay. (BOTH EXHALE) You're gonna do great. I know it. So are you. Bye, Emily. Bye. (EXHALES) Jordan. EMILY: Art for me has always been about change. Changing the way you see a building, a town, yourself. But I've finally realized people can do that, too. It's easy to think that nobody understands, that other people have it easier. But everyone is struggling in different ways, and in the end, we all want the same things. To figure out who we are and where we fit in. It's a question with no simple answer. You just have to try your best, make an effort, make mistakes. Time will pass, and things will get better, step by step. There's a whole big world out there. Whole world beyond me, beyond you, beyond everyone. There are millions of people, each with their own story to tell. But if you're lucky, you'll get to be a part of it, and they'll get to be a part of yours. (CELL PHONE RINGING) Hey. How's Tokyo? What time is it there? JORDAN: Early. So, you all packed? (EXHALES) Yeah. I think I am. So? So what? Come on. You know what. I have no idea what you're talking about. Are you going or not? I don't know. I haven't decided yet. Oh, come on. Yes, you have. KAREN: Emily, can you come out here? Uh, yeah. I'll be out in a few. Okay, I got to go. I promise I'll take a bunch of pictures. Get some sleep. Later. (SIGHS) (SOFT INSTRUMENTAL MUSIC) (EXHALES) Oh, you look beautiful. Thank you. Look outside. (CHUCKLES) I thought you were in Tokyo. We leave Monday. Took the weekend off. You never fail to surprise me. I told you I wanted to go to prom. You showed me that you have to have an actual life. I know. You showed me that, too. You look amazing in that dress, by the way. (CHUCKLES) Thanks. That's a nice tux. Oh! (CHUCKLES) Thank you. Thank you very much. So, ready for another new life experience? Yeah. Let's go. (UPBEAT MUSIC PLAYING) (FANS CHEERING) Jordan! Jordan! Jordan! Jordan! Jordan! Jordan! Jordan! Jordan! Jordan! (ELECTRONIC MUSIC PLAYING) (SOFT INSTRUMENTAL MUSIC) (CELL PHONE ALARM BEEPING) Yeah, of course it's frustrating. You've been planning this for what, months? Right. Okay, did anyone take a statement? (SIGHS) Keys? Was there any video footage at all? KAREN: Yeah, please.
