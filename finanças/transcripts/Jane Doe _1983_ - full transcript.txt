[WATER FLOWING] [MUSIC PLAYING] [DOG BARKS] BOY: Harry. Harry! Harry! Come on, Harry. [DOG BARKS] Harry. Come on, Harry! [DOG BARKS] [GASPS] [SCREAMS] [SIRENS] [POLICE RADIO CHATTER] [CHATTER] REPORTER: Get a close-up, will you? EMT: Come on, hurry up. We're losing her. [CHATTER] REPORTER: Great. Terrific. Find anything? Not yet. Same MO. See if they can get the press out of there, Willy. They're walking all over the evidence. [POLICE RADIO CHATTER] I'll give it a shot. [POLICE RADIO CHATTER] [CHATTER] Let's-- let's move-- let's move it. Is this a roadside strangle, Lieutenant? No comment. There's been five killings in three months. 11 weeks, Terry. Well, what action are the police taking? Right now, we're trying to get you people off the evidence. POLICEMAN: All right, let's go. Come on. Move them out. [CHATTER] C'mon, give us a break. [POLICE RADIO CHATTER] [CHATTER] - Willy. Decoy the press. Clean up around here. I'm going to the hospital. [SIRENS] EMT: One-one, two-one, three-one, four-one-- HOSPITAL ANNOUNCEMENT: Trauma team to Emergency. EMT: One one thousand, two one thousand, three one thousand-- HOSPITAL ANNOUNCEMENT: Trauma team to Emergency, stat. Five one thousand, one one thousand. OK, we've got an approximately 30-year-old female strangulation. And she just went into cardiac arrest. OK, let's go in the next room. She was, uh, found in a shallow grave. [CHATTER] DOCTOR: Get the gurney down there. EMT: I've got to pick up. DOCTOR 2: [INAUDIBLE] on the double. DOCTOR: Drop that side. All right, here we go. Easy. OK. OK, here we go. DOCTOR: OK, where's my [INAUDIBLE] OK, let's get her hooked up to the monitor. Start ventilating her. One thousand three, one thousand four, one thousand five. One thousand one, one thousand two, one thousand three, one thousand four, one thousand five. One thousand one-- - Do we have any pulses? No pulse. [INAUDIBLE] OK, recommend [INAUDIBLE].. Let's get ready to shock her. Let's get the pads on. Back off. Ready? Everybody off. Let's get set to shock her. Everyone ready? [BUZZ] OK, do we have a pulse? We have a pulse, real slow. OK, let's go for a blood pressure. OK, let's get ready for an [INAUDIBLE] and then an [INAUDIBLE] DOCTOR: Cardio enzymes? By the way, do we know who she is? Jane Doe. OK, she feels really cold to me. Let's get a temperature on her and see if she's hypothermic. HOSPITAL ANNOUNCEMENT: Dr. Silver, telephone. Dr. Silver, telephone. Dr. Ravinsky, office. Dr. Ravinsky, call your office. Here, pulse is coming up now. OK, let's go for a repeat blood pressure. NURSE: Blood pressure 100 [INAUDIBLE] now. DOCTOR: [INAUDIBLE] OK? - Yeah. OK, let's call for some of blood work and some x-rays here. And we'll continue the workup. [BEEPING] Hey, Doc, is she gonna make it? This woman has been beaten, strangled, buried for five or six hours at least. She's lucky the grave was shallow and the dirt was loose. And the only reason she survived that is because she got so cold. What? The body needs less oxygen when it's cold. Listen, Doc, there's a guy out there who's murdered four women. This woman is the only witness. We'd like to know if she's going to make it. She's in severe shock and still unconscious. But there's no broken bones and no internal injuries. So if she survives the shock-- When are you gonna know? When she wakes up and tells us. [BEEPING] - You find anything? - Not much. This guys is clean and careful every time. Not that careful. He left this one breathing. Yeah, he pulled her across here, like she was still struggling. She alive? So far. Pulled the water. Must have been in a hurry. Yeah, the grave wasn't as neat or deep as the others. LIEUTENANT QUINN: That's why she had a chance. Hm? LIEUTENANT QUINN: Her body temperature dropped, needed less oxygen. Probably saw someone coming and had to get out of here fast. - Probably. POLICEMAN: Lieutenant? Come over here. It's the hospital. Quinn here. POLICEMAN (OVER RADIO): She's made it. She's stable. They moved her out of Intensive. I'm on my way. POLICEMAN (OVER RADIO): 10-4. [SIRENS] [CLEARS THROAT] [WHIMPERS] Hello. Don't be frightened. I'll just stay a moment. Where am I. You are in the county hospital. Who are you? My name is Lieutenant Quinn. I'd like to get a statement from you. I don't, uh-- can't, uh-- what am I doing here? LIEUTENANT QUINN: What's your name? You're from the police? Yes, I've been assigned to your case. I'd like you to tell me what happened to you last night. What's today? Can you identify the man who attacked you? Somebody attacked me? You don't remember being attacked? [TRIES TO CATCH BREATH] No. What's the last thing you remember? [SIRENS] I don't. You don't what? Remember. I don't remember anything. - At all? - No. LIEUTENANT QUINN: Listen. Listen, let's try again. What's your name? [CRYING] I don't know. [DOOR OPENS AND CLOSES] All right, Lieutenant. Please leave us alone now. [SOBBING] Hello. I'm Addie Coleman. Dr. Beck asked me to stop and check up on you when you woke up. - You're a doctor? - Yes. I'm a psychiatrist. Now look, you're very safe here. And you can talk to me. Now, you tell me your name. When they found you, you had no identification. I don't know. Anything you tell me will be held in strict confidence. My God, what happened? Where are you from? Where do you live? I don't remember. How old are you? Is there anything you do remember-- a friend, place, perhaps a song? Look, look, I really do want to help you. You've been a great deal. Now, tell me what you do remember. Hm? Dark. My head hurt. I opened my eyes. I was in this room. [CRYING] All right, shh. Shh. Shh. All right. You're all right now. It's all right to feel confused and frightened, because it will pass. And what you're feeling is just temporary. Can you help me? I think so if you try. What happened? Why can't I remember? I don't know exactly. But we'll find out when we work together. I think what you went through was so terrible that you're not ready to remember it just now. So don't you try too hard. Now, you try to get some rest. I'll see you later. [DOOR CLOSES] [WHIMPERS] What the hell were you doing? You can't just go barging into a patient's room that way. Listen, Doctor, I'm sorry if I upset her. But I have to talk to her, and I have to talk to her now. Well, you're not going back in there. She can't even tell you her name What's wrong with her? Well, it's a dissociative reaction-- disorientation, loss of memory induced by severe trauma. Does that means she has amnesia? Yes. I think it's psychological, not organic, but I'll have to see the tests. Well, how long's she going to be out of touch? Well, it's hard to tell. You never know. Could be two hours, two days, two months. I don't know. - Two months? The recovery depends on her emotional security. Now, if we could find somebody who knows her-- a friend, family, somebody-- I have to communicate with this woman. Well, I'll do everything possible, Lieutenant. It'll just take time. We don't have time. Look, Lieutenant, if you push her too hard and make her too aware of what she's been through, you'll just deepen her fears, and you'll drive her memory further away. Now, just let it come back naturally. That'll happen when she begins to feel safe again. You don't seem to understand. She is not safe. Well, don't you dare tell her that. We may lose her forever. Nurse, I want the television and the telephone disconnected in Jane Doe's room. - Yes, Doctor. All right, I'm going to give her some time, but I sure hope she comes around before we have another dead body to deal with. You know what I mean? Nothing to the press. I don't want anybody to know that this dame is alive. [SIRENS] What'd you get from the lab? - Nothing. This guys is slick. He never gives us anything. What about the footprints? Rain made the ground too soggy. They say they were between sizes 9 and 11. [INAUDIBLE] sounds like a 10. We got nothing. I want you to get all the missing person reports on this Jane Doe that match her-- height, weight, age, coloring, everything. For the county? For the county, for the state, for the whole country. I want to find out who she is. That'll take days. Get Kerry to help you. I want it 24 hours. [CHATTER] [PHONE RINGING] What are you waiting on? I just want you to know that I had nothing to do with it. With the murder, Willy? I know that. - You don't know that. - I don't know what? What is this, a contest? What's going on? [BREATHING UNEVENLY] I thought this was my case. It is. What are you overriding my orders for? Because I'm your boss. It's what they call a chain of command. You tell them. I tell you. Get it? I did not want this in the press, Cap. I know you didn't. That's why they have people like me in charge of people like you. This community is frightened. If we've got a live witness, they want to know about it. Makes them feel safer. Makes them like us more. When they like us more, I like you more. Ah, consider it a way of getting along better. I counter-manage your orders as an act of friendship. What if the guy reads the headlines, leaves town before we catch him? Lieutenant, there's nothing I'd like better than having that guy leave this town. He's just going to kill someplace else. But he won't be doing it here. I can't take care of the whole world. My job is to protect this place. And if he stays, I hope you realize you've made this woman a target. So protect her. Catch the guy. That's your job, huh? NURSE: Well, it's a CAT scan. Lets us know if there's any physical damage to the brain. Hm, CAT scan. There once was a man from Japan whose poetry never was scanned. When they asked him why, he gave this reply, I just put as many words in the last line as I possibly can. - What? - Hm? What was that? What? Just wait here a second. I'll be right back. [DOOR OPENS AND CLOSES] NURSE: Perfect. There's a movie I want to see in town. Oh, really? Well, let's go. NURSE: All right. [GIGGLES] [CHATTER] [CAR STARTS] [GASPS] [RATTLING] Open! Open! [SIGHS] [PANTING] [SCREAMS] - Whoa. Whoa. Whoa. It's all right. It's Lieutenant Quinn. It's all right. You're all right. [CRYING] Sir, I don't know how she got past. She was there, and then she was gone. You're relieved here. Go on back downtown. [CAR ZOOMING] [FOOTSTEPS] [WHIMPERING] Now, if I had known your men were not going to do a good job, I would have had one of my nurses watching her. We weren't looking for her to go after her. We were on the alert for someone trying to get in. Well, it's typical behavior for amnesiacs to go wandering. Now, they have to be watched every minute. Hope you haven't done too much damage. If someone had told her she was in danger, I doubt if she'd have gone wandering off like that. Well, she's got enough to be afraid of. The last thing in the world she needs to know is that there's some killer still after her. Fear is protective. It keeps people from taking chances. If you ask me, that's what she needs. She's got so much fear in her right now, she can't remember who she is. JANE DOE: I saw the newspaper. Somebody tried to kill me. I saw my picture! I'm sorry you did. Now, let's just sit down-- I don't want to sit down! I want you to help me. DR. COLEMAN: I can't help you when you run away. You are not helping me. You act like you are, but you're not. You have every right to feel frightened right now. You are keeping things from me. You're not telling me everything you know. It's a very difficult problem. Now, we're trying to deal with it as-- Don't give me that psychiatric bull. Now, I want answers-- answers! Right now, I want you to settle down. I don't want to settle down. [GLASS BREAKING] You're get hysterical, and when you're-- Of course I'm hysterical. Now, I understand how you feel. How can you understand how I feel? Did you ever see a newspaper with a picture of yourself in it and not know who that person is? No. JANE DOE: Well. But you have to trust me, because I know how to help you if you'll only let me. Now, I'm going to give you something to calm you down, because I don't want you to hurt yourself. Please, my consciousness is all I have. If you take it away, I'll be nothing. [CRIES] - All right. JANE DOE: [CRYING] - Shh. Shh. Shh. Shh. Shh. Shh. - [WHIMPERING] All right. Come on. Now, I want you to feel comfortable. And if you want something to make you sleep, you just tell me, and I'll-- I'll order it. All right, could you tell me how you felt when you saw the newspaper? - I panicked. I was afraid and cold. You see, it was cold when we found you. I think you associate cold with what happened to you. Look, I don't know if it's a memory or what but I had this vision. It only lasted for a minute, and I don't know what it means. Do you remember what you saw? Trees-- tall, tall trees. And-- and the wind was blowing, and there were branches coming at me. - Good, good. - And it's night. - That's good. You see, that is good. Yeah? That is your memory trying to resurface. That's wonderful Now, I want you to relax, and you try to get some sleep. And tomorrow, we'll talk about it again, all right? You just relax. [BREATHING HEAVILY] This Roadside Strangler, is he trying to kill me? We don't know. But he can't get to you. HOSPITAL ANNOUNCEMENT: Visiting hours are now over. All visitors please leave the hospital in five minutes. Next visiting hours will be tomorrow from 11:00 to 2:00. [PHONE RINGING] Central. Ms. Caruthers. Can you tell me the room number for the roadside strangler's victim? I'd like to send her some flowers. One moment, sir. I'll check. HOSPITAL ANNOUNCEMENT: Visiting hours are now over. There's a man calling on line 87 asking questions about the strangler victim. Well, just hang in there. Keep him on the line. Put a tracer on 87. Uh, I'm sorry, I'm not sure what room they moved her too. Uh, if you just be patient another second, I'll try to find a doctor to ask. Hello? Hello? He didn't hang up. Traced the call to one of the public phones right here in the lobby. This is it. Rope it off, and get the dusters in here. Why'd he leave it off the hook? What'd he know we can trace it? He's a wise guy, Willy. I can't believe he had the guts to walk right in here. He's playing with us. I think he's telling us he'll be back. [MOANING] [FOOTSTEPS] [MOANING] [SCRAPING] Ah! [GASPING] [SIRENS] [POLICE RADIO CHATTER] Ah, come on, don't drink that stuff. Let the coffee attack the donut first so it's weaker when it starts on you. I got a cast iron gut, Willy. Coffee doesn't have a chance when it gets down there. You got those NPRs? Yeah, here. You know, the way you treat your body is definitely police brutality. These up-to-date? As of 10 o'clock last night. This all of them? Just the ones that match her description. Well, let's get started. It's not there. - How do you know that? - Went through them already. Let's go through them again. I went through them twice. Come on, look, you're giving yourself an ulcer. Here, have a donut. I don't want a donut. I want to collar this guy. Lieutenant Quinn, they found an abandoned car, an '81 blue sedan parked up the road behind some trees. Name and address? Yeah, it's a local, Manning-- a Victoria Shaffer, 27443 Bay Drive. Thank you. [PHONE RINGING, CHATTER] This could be our Jane Doe. Why am I referred to as Jane Doe? That's what we call people when we don't know who they are. Guess that makes it official. Hm? I'm nobody. Oh, it doesn't mean that at all. It's just that we need some way of referring to you. Is there another name you'd be more comfortable with? No. Jane's all right, I guess. It's just that it makes me feel like a character in a first grade book. Look, Spot, see Jane run? That's very good. You remember books. That's good. If you want to get past the first grade, I'll be impressed. I want to be somebody again. You are somebody. We just don't know who. [RADIO CRACKLING] POLICEMAN (OVER RADIO): Unit Four, Unit Four, go to 27443 Bay Drive. Check out the ownership of abandoned car to one Victoria Shaffer. Step on it. POLICEMAN 2 (OVER RADIO): What's the rush? POLICEMAN (OVER RADIO): Quinn thinks it belongs to the Jane Doe. [KNOCKING] [DOOR OPENS] Good morning. [DOOR CLOSES] Remember me? You, I remember. It's me I forgot. You the admirer? I guess so, yeah. Who's Victoria Shaffer? Well, I thought you might know. You look tired. I'm due for a vacation. Going South for a month. [WATER RUNNING] Am I Victoria Shaffer? Well, we don't know yet. We're checking. If you find out, will you tell me? Absolutely. Lieutenant? Was I raped? - No. Thanks. [DOOR CLOSES] [TAPE REWINDING] TAPE RECORDING: This is your introduction to conversational Spanish. Lesson number one-- Como esta usted? Repeat after me. [KNOCKING] Yeah. Lieutenant? I've just heard Victoria Shaffer's here in the hospital. I would like to see her. Who are you? My name is David Shaffer. I'm Victoria's husband. Where is she? Why haven't we heard from you before this? He was out of town. Let him talk. I've been away on a business trip. I had no idea there was a problem until I came home. Yeah, I was there when the cab arrived. When's the last time you spoke to her? Monday night when she took me to the airport. Don't you call home when you're away on trips. I did, but there was no answer. But that's not unusual for Tori. She said she was going away for a few days while I was gone. Tori likes to go off every now and then and think. Listen, I'll be glad to answer any of your questions later. Right now, I'd like to see my wife. Hello, I'm Dr. Coleman. I understand you're the husband. Yes, David Shaffer. How is she? May I see her? Do you mind if I ask this gentleman a few questions? Excuse me, Lieutenant, may I point out that this is a hospital and not the police station? And you have no legal authority in this matter. As a matter of fact, neither do I. Now Jane is-- Victoria. Victoria is neither under arrest, nor has she been committed. To answer your question, Mr. Shaffer, it's up to Victoria. If she's willing to see you, she may. And if she's comfortable with the idea, I'll certainly recommended it. - Thank you. Did he check out? Yeah, he's her husband all right. I tell you, I went through the house. It's full of the two of them. Pictures, degrees, you name it, they've got it or did it. Believe me, they are very well-off. Roadside Strangler probably got her on the way back from the airport. It's the right road, and her car's pointed towards her home. Did you check the car for prints? I found what only you'd expect to find. [PHONE RINGING] [DOOR OPENS] You don't suppose I dress like this, do you? I don't think so. You're an English professor. How do you know that? Your husband just told. - I'm married? - Mhm. And he's here, and he wants to see you. It never occurred to me I might have a husband. Well, you do. Now, if you're not up to seeing him, you don't have to right now. - I just had a terrible thought. - What's that? Well, what if I get my old life back and find out it's a total wreck? He seems like a very nice man. If I don't like him, can I throw him back? You can throw them my way. How's that? [GIGGLING] And your name is Victoria. They call you Tori. - Tori? Mhm. Tori. Tori Doe. No, no, no, Tori Shaffer? Like it? No. Well, nobody likes their name. Really? I was just getting used to Jane. All right, bring him in. Now, I think it would be good if you saw him alone. And I'll be right outside if you need me. Shall we? Come in. Hi. Hello. - Do you know me? - No. How are you? They say I'm OK. I'm sorry. It's awkward. Blind dates are tough, aren't they? Yes. [GIGGLES] So, do you come here often? [NERVOUS LAUGHTER] I'm sorry. David? Yes. Um, tell me about us. [SIGHS] We've been married two years, have a beautiful house on the bay. You're 32-years-old. You teach English at the University. And right now, you're on sabbatical. Children? Not yet. You wanted to finish your dissertation. We travel a lot. You like that. Family? You're an only child. Your mother and father have both passed away. What do you do? I make investments. Works out pretty well. So do you know how I got into all of this? You took me to the airport Monday night, and then you went off by yourself for a few days. Off, all alone? Yes. Yes. Every once in a while, you get this bug, and you just take off, usually when I'm away. I used to worry about you a lot, and just when I'm getting used to it, this has to happen. It sounds like I'm a lot of trouble. You're worth it. I know you've been through a tremendous ordeal. But I'm hoping you'll want to come home. The idea of leaving with someone you can't remember has got to be frightening. Of course it is. But look, on the other hand, you've only known us for three days. Three days is all my life. But you've known David for several years. If you want to get your memory back, you've got to go where your memories are. If you want to feel safe, you've got to be with people who love you. Now, we can't give you that here. It's a scary proposition. Scary maybe. But look, you've got to take some chances before you get better. And we'll keep in touch. I'll always be here. [CHATTER] HOSPITAL ANNOUNCEMENT: Dr. Ravinsky, Office. Dr. Ravinsky, call the office. I've decided to go. I don't think that's a very good idea. This hospital is no place for her. She's much better off in her own home with someone who cares. Security'd be a lot easier for us to maintain here at the hospital. It's gonna take an awful lot of my men to protect her at home. You're going to watch our house? Mr. Shaffer, your wife is the only person alive who can identify this killer. Naturally, we'd like to protect her. The killer doesn't know where she lives. Don't you think all your men around the place are just going to draw attention to us? You want to take that chance? No. Lieutenant, um, going home may be the only way I'll find out who I am. Until then, I'm not use to your case anyway. Well, the case isn't the only thing I'm worried about. VICTORIA: Is this where we live? - Yes. Does any of this look familiar to you? No. [DOOR CLOSES] Where do you want us, Lieutenant? Take the gate, Charlie. Would you care for the grand tour? - All right. - Hm. Does this seem as crazy to you as it does to me? Sure. Anything? No. [LAUGHS] Cabo San Lucas, Mexico, two years ago. And over there is where you never did a dish. Oh. [GIGGLES] My degrees? Uh-huh. Ah, they're probably designed for just such an occasion. When someone can't remember that they're smart, they can go read it on their wall. [LAUGHS] [GRUNTS] Still have a great sense of humor. [LAUGHS] It just proves that talk isn't connected to the brain. Think he knows what he's doing? How should I know? I'm only three days old. I think he has delusions of adequacy. TOY: How like the winter hath my absence been? [DINGING] [CLACKING] [HEART BEATING] [SCARY MUSIC] [SCRAPING] Make it stop. Make it stop! Have I frightened? No more. Enough! - Why? - No. I want to leave this room. [BIRDS CHIRPING] [CLANGING] You know, I'll have to have my own room. I'll need a little time, David. You see, to me, you're still a stranger. Of course. I understand. I don't want you to do anything that would make you feel uncomfortable. I'll stay in the guest room. Thank you. TAPE RECORDING: Pasando el puente. LIEUTENANT QUINN: Puente. TAPE RECORDING: Dome la izquierda. LIEUTENANT QUINN: Dome [SPEAKING SPANISH POORLY] TAPE RECORDING: Si, esta un buen restaurante. Restaurante TAPE RECORDING: La rancharita. La rancharita. [HEART BEATING, EERIE NOISES] [FOOTSTEPS] [SCREAMS] [SCREAMS] [GASPING] [PANTING] [SCREAMS] No! Oh, David! Oh, David! [CRYING] Oh, oh. It's OK. I'm right here. [CRYING] I was having a nightmare, and I-- Yes, you were. Oh, baby. It's OK. I was afraid somebody had tried to break into your room. [KNOCKING] [PANTING] It' all right. It's OK. [KNOCKING] It's OK. I'll be right back. I'm just going to see who that is, all right? [KNOCKING] [WHIMPERING] [KNOCKING] What the hell's going on in here? She had a dream. Somebody try to get in here? I don't think so. Don't you guys ever sleep? I drink a lot of coffee. POLICEMAN (OVER RADIO): Lieutenant Quinn, Lieutenant Quinn, 16. Quinn here. POLICEMAN (OVER RADIO): We've got another one, Cyprus Park. This one's a jogger. I'm five minutes away. [CAR STARTS] [TIRES SQUEAL] NEWS ANCHOR (ON TV): There's been a new development in the Roadside Strangler case. Apparently, a sixth victim has been found. Let's go to our live-action camera and Ann Petry. ANN PETRY (ON TV): The sixth victim was found here in this secluded spot early this morning. Again, it was death by strangulation. Again, of course, the victim was a woman. The difference this morning is that a note has been found with the body. Unfortunately, we do not know what is in that note. However, I see Lieutenant Bill Quinn who has been on the case from the beginning. Lieutenant Quinn, if we could speak to a moment. There has been a note found. Can tell us what is in the note that was found with the body? No, I can't. ANN PETRY (ON TV): Lieutenant Quinn, we are talking about the sixth murder in this community by the Roadside Strangler. Can you give us any information? No comment. ANN PETRY (ON TV): How about the who that was in the hospital, the fifth victim, the amnesiac? Can you give us any information there? LIEUTENANT QUINN (ON TV): No. ANN PETRY (ON TV): Well, once again, we are-- don't seem to be getting much cooperation for the police. [HEART BEATING, EERIE NOISES] --as they happen. This is Ann Petry for Action News. NEWS ANCHOR (ON TV): Thank you, Ann. As we said-- [LEAVES CRUNCHING] [SHOVEL SCRAPING, HEART BEATING]- [HORN HONKING] [ENGINE RUNNING] [TIRES SQUEAKING] What's the matter with you, lady? You nuts or something? I'll take care of this. Stand loose. [DOOR SHUTS] Come on. Why do you do this to me? I'm too young to have a heart attack. Oh yeah? You don't look that young to me. [SIGHS] Must be the coffee. [CAR PULLS AWAY] What are you running away from? I don't know. When I saw that girl's body on TV, I just felt like it was my fault. - Well, don't blame yourself. - Yeah? Who should I blame? - Blame me. Everyone else does. Do you have a girl? Or are you married, Lieutenant? No, but you are. So they tell me. You want me to take you home? Not yet. I don't feel comfortable in that house. You know, I feel so sorry for that man. There are pictures of us together all over the place, and it looks like we're having so much fun. You want to go downtown with me to look at some pictures, mugshots. You know, they might stir your memory. It's worth a try. - Sure. Let's try it. This is Quinn 16. POLICEMAN (OVER RADIO): 16, go ahead. Yeah, call David Shaffer, and tell him I got his wife. POLICEMAN (OVER RADIO): Roger. I copy. VICTORIA: Dr. Coleman said there are two ways to get my memory back. One is to wait and let it come back slowly. The other is to sort of face the whole business head-on, sort of shock myself into remembering. That's the fastest way. Well, why didn't you do that first? I forget. I've got amnesia, you know? You didn't forget that. Why? She said I might go off the deep end. Well, I don't know anything about that. Maybe she's right. Maybe. But she's not me. I have to know what happened. From now on, I don't want you to hold anything back from me. OK, what do you want to know? Everything. Let's go, other office. Right over here. It started 11 weeks ago. Lisa Melbourne, 19-years-old-- she was found right there. Alba Goodman was found nine days later right here. And Janet Lewis, 27-years-old, she was found there two weeks later. 10 days after that, we found the Cramer girl there. All the murders had the same MO-- young woman strangled, nude body found in a shallow grave in a remote area, none of them sexually molested. Two weeks after that, we found you right there. This going to be too much for you? No. Go on. LIEUTENANT QUINN: Today's victim, we still haven't identified her. What do you know about the killer? Well, we have a psychiatric profile based on his MO. He's a compulsive personality, probably gets a big charge out of the killing and the publicity he's getting. I'd say he's probably read every magazine, newspaper, seen every television account. We try to keep it out of the press, but-- Do you think you'll catch him? I know we'll catch him. This guy has a flair for the dramatic, which means he's going to have to expose himself more and more. We'll get him. Let's get started. Take a seat. [PHONE RINGING] [CHATTER] This is a file of known possibles. [POLICE RADIO CHATTER] Look at all these guys carefully. If anything rings a bell, I'll be right out there at my desk. VICTORIA: All right. [GUNSHOT] [CLICK] [GUNSHOT] [CLICK] [GUNSHOT] [CHATTER, PHONE RINGING] [POLICE RADIO CHATTER] Was there any picture that made you feel anything? A shiver, a tingle, anything? I have an idea. LIEUTENANT QUINN: What? Why don't you take me to the place where I was buried? If that doesn't shake me up, I don't know what would. I don't know about that. It's my decision. [CAR ACCELERATING] Thanks. Right up there. Sure you want to go through with this? Yes. Straight ahead. [THUNDER, RAIN FALLING] Tell me what happened. Last Thursday morning around dawn, I got a call they found another body. When I arrived here, they were digging you out of this grave. You were nude, had been strangled, and were as cold as a fish. Nobody expected you to be alive. They were wrapping you in a sheet getting ready to take you to the morgue when one of the medics detected a sign of life. [WHIMPERING] DAVID: Leave her alone. [MOANING SOFTLY] Just what the hell did you think you were doing bringing her up here like this? It's her decision. And you think she's capable of making that kind of decision? She doesn't even know who she is. LIEUTENANT QUINN: That's the objective, to find out who she is. - Yeah. I'm OK. All you're interested in is your job. You don't care what happens to her. I'm taking her away from here. Then, she'll be safe. How did you find us? I went to the police station. Officer Dean told me you brought her up here. My god, hasn't she been through enough? [DOOR CLOSES] [CAR STARTS] [CHATTER] [POLICE RADIO CHATTER] Anything new, guys? Uh, Captain wants to see you. [POLICE RADIO CHATTER] [KNOCKING] You ever heard of a guy named Rudolph Favor? Rudolph Favor? Sounds like a dancer from Vienna. What about him? - He's a psychic. - A what? A psychic. You know, one of those guys who commune with the spirits. Never heard of him. Well,I'm bringing him in to give you a hand. The hell you are. I don't need a hand. You need something, Quinn. Right now, you got nothing. A psychic's a dumb idea. You're gonna turn this thing into a circus. Tell me you got something, or I'm bringing in the psyching. Oh, man, come-- give me 48 hours. I've got an idea. You want to hear it? No, I don't want to hear it. If it works, great. If it doesn't work, you take the fall. You don't have to yell, Cap. My deafness has cleared up since I knocked off the coffee. Results in 48 hours, or your partner's going to be a dancer from Vienna. VICTORIA: Mm. DAVID: [NON-ENGLISH SPEEHC] VICTORIA: [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH] [GIGGLING] [KISS] [KNOCKING] Just a minute. [KNOCKING] May I come in? David, let him in. It wasn't his fault. How ya doin'? I'm alive. That's something. Did you remember anything? No. You guys going somewhere? We're considering it. It isn't safe for her here. You said so yourself. Listen, you want me to catch this maniac, don't you? Well, I've got an idea, if you're willing to try it. What do you have in mind? A press conference. I think we can lure this guy in. As far as anybody knows, you're still in the hospital, and the press is dying to talk to you. We'll hold it at the hospital, and we'll get you out there soon as it's over. You'll be perfectly safe. I don't like it. How do we do it? Simple. We lied to the press. How are you feeling? Do your remember anything? Have you recovered/ is it true that you had amnesia and you have been unable to identify your killer? Until last night, I couldn't remember anything. Now, I remember who I am and where I'm from. But the police have asked me not to say. Do you remember who attacked you? Can you identify your killer? If I saw him. I'm working now on a drawing with police artists. We think in a community this size, someone will recognize the killer once we start circulating the drawing. When will you have the drawing finished? By tomorrow. That's pretty much all we got, guys. Thanks. Jane Doe has suddenly remembered who she is. The fifth victim of the Roadside Strangler has recovered her memory, and now, she's helping police track down the killer. Today, she held a news conference from her hospital bed. Action News was there. REPORTER (ON TV): What does this guy look like? Can you describe him? LIEUTENANT QUINN (ON TV): We'll know what he looks like when we get the drawing done, Terry. Right now, we just-- you know, we don't have it finished. I'll be finished tomorrow, and then everybody will see what he looks like. REPORTER (ON TV): Well, I was trying to think of the public out there who would like, A, to protect themselves, and B, perhaps even to help the police in their search. Is he short? Oh, I think, um, Lieutenant Quinn is right. We're working on it right now, and it's coming back little by little. And we'll have it as soon as-- as soon as I can remember everything. REPORTER (ON TV): Nothing about hair or clothes, speech pattern? Care for a drink, lieutenant? No, gracias, nunca cuando trabajo, senor. DAVID: What? - Never when I work. - Very good. You speak Spanish, huh? I guess so. Fluently. You're remembering more and more all the time, Tori. Wish I could remember something I said sometime. [GUNSHOT] [GLASS SHATTERS] [SCREAMS] POLICEMAN 1: We've got gunfire! POLICEMAN 2: Did you see it, [INAUDIBLE]?? Where was that? [POLICE RADIO CHATTER, SIRENS] POLICEMAN 1: Who's up there? Are you all right? I think so. - Let's get out of here. - [INAUDIBLE] [SIRENS] DAVID: How the hell did he know where we lived? Wish I knew. POLICEMAN 1: Are you good up there? POLICEMAN 2: Yeah. POLICEMAN 1: See anything? POLICEMAN 2: No, how about you? [POLICE RADIO CHATTER] [INAUDIBLE], over here. POLICEMAN 1: [INAUDIBLE] [POLICE RADIO CHATTER] POLICEMAN 2: What about now? POLICEMAN 1: She's OK. [CAR ACCELERATES] [POLICE RADIO CHATTER] You OK? Of course she's not OK. The bullet missed her by inches. You said you'd have enough men here so that this-- [INAUDIBLE] I found this in the trees. How far away was it? - Ah, at least 200 yards. - Take it downtown. See if you can trace it. Now, my security was effective. That guy couldn't get within 200 yards of this house. At that distance, even an expert's not going to hit a target through a glass window. He misjudged his abilities. [KNOCKING] You Harry Johnson? Yes. You're under arrest. What's the charge? Attempted murder. Read the rap, Willy. You have the right to remain silent-- Officer, you're making a terrible mistake. We have a search warrant. You don't need one. I have nothing to hide. Put your hands behind your back, please. --any statements must be made of your own-- LIEUTENANT QUINN: Cuff him, Willy. Let's go. Where were you last night? At home. You were home all evening, were you? Yes. Alone? Do you live with anyone? No. I don't suppose it's a crime to live alone, hm? It's not an alibi either, pal. We found a rifle registered to you. Well, good, I-- is it in good condition? Why? Well, it was stolen from my car right after I bought it. I didn't even have a chance to get insurance for it yet. VICTORIA: So did I always hate packing? Mhm. [PHONE RINGING] No, thank you. Stimulants-- very unhealthy. What do you got? He reported the rifle stolen. We can't use this in court. Yeah, we don't have one shred of hard evidence. I don't care. This is the guy, I know it. I'm inclined to agree with you, but, uh, we can't book him. And we can't even hold him. - I'm holding him anyway. - You crazy? Captain will have your head, and the DA will bury what's left of it. So you have to let him go. Uh, Lieutenant, I saw the news tonight, and I heard that you have a witness who can identify this Roadside Strangler. I'd be happy to stand in a line-up in order to establish my innocence. If I were you, pal, I'd park my butt back in that chair. And don't get out of it without an invitation. [CHATTER] You know, if we put him in the lineup and she can't identify him, he walks. He asked for it. If we don't do it for him, he walks anyway. I'll call Jane. - Aw, come on. She wouldn't recognize your mother. Maybe we'll get lucky. The sight of this guy could shake her up. [PHONE RINGING] - Hello? - This is Quinn. Let me speak to Jane. You'll be happy to know you're going to get your privacy back. We got him. Just a minute. Hey, Tori, it's Quinn. They've got the killer. [FOOTSTEPS] You've got him? We think so. Listen, we need you to come down and pick him out of a lineup in order to hold him. You think you can handle that? - I'll try. When? Right now. Otherwise, I'm going to have to let him go. TORI (ON PHONE): I'll be right down. You're terrific. [SHOVEL SCRAPING, HEART BEATING, EERIE NOISES] DAVID: Are you all right? - Yes. Excuse me, we're here to see Lieutenant Quinn. Oh, yes, he's expecting you. [BUZZ] Please, uh, come this way. Thank you. Several men are going to appear before you. You'll be able to see them, but they will not be able to see you. Each one of them has been assigned a number. If you want to refer him, refer to him by number only. [CAMERA CLICKING] When the lineup's completed, I want you to fill out the card. If you cannot identify anyone, so indicate. If you need to communicate with me, write it down. No talking. Number one, step forward. Step back. Number two, step forward. Step back. Number three, step forward. Step back. Number four, step forward. Remove your hat. Look them carefully. [INAUDIBLE] Mr. Shaffer, no talking, please. Put your hat back on. Step back. Number five, step forward. [PHONE RINGING] Step back. I'm sorry. Hey, it's not your fault. It's my dumb idea. I suppose now you have to let the killer go. - I suppose. - Oh, that does it. We're going to be on the road tonight. Quinn, we hit the jackpot. We just got a reply from the FBI lab in Washington about the notes we found on the last victim. Even though, uh, he'd wiped it clean, the lab lifted the paste-on letters, and they found a print in the glue. Johnson's for sure? You got it, huh? The creep nailed himself. Which one was he? Cinco, the last one. You're safe now. Let's go home. We can be on the road in an hour. Going away, are you? Goodbye, Lieutenant. I'll check up on. Tori. Thank you. [DOOR CLOSES] Willy, I want to go talk to Johnson. [DOOR OPENS] She didn't identify me, did she? [DOOR CLOSES] LIEUTENANT QUINN: She wasn't ready to make a positive ID, but we don't need her. We got you anyway. Oh, really? Yeah, we got our print report back from the FBI. They found one of your prints in the glue on the note you left. With that and your rifle, we could get a conviction with a jury of lifers from San Quentin. Tell me something. Why did you volunteer for the lineup? Because I knew she couldn't identify me. Then, why'd you make an attempt on her life? You missed her on purpose, didn't ya? I'll bet you're a chess player, aren't you? I've won a few games. Chess game? He wasn't satisfied with getting caught, Willy. He needed something better, something more flamboyant. Didn't you? He wanted to get caught and still get away with it. So what does he do? He leads us right to himself, thinking he had the perfect alibi. What perfect alibi? He takes a pawn shot at a witness who claims she can identify the Roadside Strangler. Only, she's got amnesia. So when she can't identify him, he gets off scot-free not only on that charge but all the charges. What's a man with your mind doing working for a hick town like this? Collaring basket cases like you. Tell me, why'd you leave the note in the first place? Because I am not a bungler. I hated those headlines that say, "Killer Makes Mistake." Everybody makes mistakes, pal. I told you I am not a bungler. You caught me with your first-class police work. You were operating on my level, first-class. I would never have botched a job like the one done on that woman, never. She wasn't one of yours? [LAUGHS] Of course not. You mean to tell me you never went near that Shaffer woman? Never. If I had, she'd be dead like all the rest. You're going to a very dark place now, pal, hopefully never to be heard from again. [THUD] Lock this guy up. [DOOR SLAMS] If he didn't kill her, who did? Did you tell Shaffer where the grave site was? No. Well, I told him you were there, but I didn't tell me where it was. And it wasn't in the paper. Now I know why he was so worried. He was afraid she'd remember. And when she does, she's dead. You know, the doctor said once you felt safe, you'd start to remember. Anything? - No. [CAR STARTS] [TIRES SQUEAL] [EERIE NOISES, WINDSHIELD WIPERS] Could you turn on the heater? I'm cold again. You always love Mexico. [FLASHBACK] VICTORIA: I'm leaving you, David. DAVID: I'll never let you leave me. [FLASHBACK OVER] Best place to get your memory back. We'll be a long way from here, just the two of us again. [CAR ACCELERATING] [HEART BEATING, SHOVEL SCRAPING] [BRAKES SQUEAL] Is anything wrong? No, just don't feel well. Looking at the man who tried to kill me is upsetting me. Are you starting to remember again? No. But in time, I will. - Yeah. Why don't we just grab our backs and go? We can be in Cabo San Lucas by lunch. OK, I'll be ready in a couple of minutes. OPERATOR (ON PHONE): Operator. Connect me with police headquarters. OPERATOR (ON PHONE): Sorry, I can't hear you. The police, connect me with the police. OPERATOR (ON PHONE): I'm ringing. POLICEMAN (ON PHONE): Sargent Ferns. Uh, Lieutenant Quinn, please. POLICEMAN (ON PHONE): Just a moment. I'll connect. Hello? Hello? [TAPS] [TAP] [TAP] [PANTING] [KEYS JINGLING] Damn. [CAR ENGINE SPUTTERING] [THUD] Tori. Tori? I won't hurt you. I love you. [CAR ENGINE SPUTTERING] Tori? Tori. Ah! Ah! You can't leave me! Ah! You want to leave? [SCREAMING] [CAR ENGINE SPUTTERING] (YELLING) Open up! [BANGING] [GLASS BREAKING] [SCREAMS] [CAR ENGINE STARTS] [TIRES SQUEALING] [CAR ACCELERATING] [SCREAMING] [GLASS BREAKING] [SCREAMING] David, stop it! [TIRES SQUEALING] Pull over! Pull over! Pull over! Pull over! [BANG] [TIRES SQUEALING] 16. Send a backup to the Shaffer house. POLICEMAN (OVER RADIO): 10-4. [TIRES SQUEALING, CAR ACCELERATING] Oh god. [ENGINE SPUTTERING] [SIGHS] [PANTING] [TIRES SQUEALING, CAR ACCELERATING] [CRASHING, TIRES SQUEALING] [CRASHING] [EXPLOSION] [CRYING] Oh god.
