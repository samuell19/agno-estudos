[WHISPERING] How much time do we have? We have about 15 minutes, and then we really have to get out of here. HOW ABOUT SIGNING ONE FOR MY GOOD FRIEND CAMERON? JAKE, BEFORE YOU START, THERE'S SOMETHING YOU HAVE TO UNDERSTAND. I DID THIS FOR YOU, TOO. YOU KNOW, I COULD HAVE CHOSEN ANYBODY. LUCKY ME. AND I HAVE A CHECK FOR YOU. WHAT CHECK? 25% OF ALL THE PROCEEDS FROM THE BOOK. IT'S THE LEAST I COULD DO. LOOK, MAN. I AIN'T NEVER ASKED YOU FOR NOTHING, AND I DAMN SURE DON'T NEED YOUR PROCEEDS. COME ON, JAKE. THIS IS YOUR WAY OUT. THERE'S A SUBSTANTIAL AMOUNT OF MONEY IN THAT ENVELOPE. YOU DON'T GET IT, MAN. I HATE WHAT YOU DID, NOT JUST BECAUSE OF ME, MAN, BUT ALL THESE PEOPLE OUT HERE WHO IN TROUBLE AND NEED HELP. YOU CREATED THIS FANTASY WORLD, MAN. YOU GOT PEOPLE THINKING THEY DON'T NEED TO HELP OUT. I PLAYED MY DRUM FOR 3 HOURS TODAY. I GOT 17 CENT, BUT I SIGNED TWO AUTOGRAPHS. PUTS A PRETTY FUCKED UP SPIN ON THINGS, DON'T YOU THINK, CAM? I'M SORRY, JAKE. I JUST TRIED TO DO WHAT WAS BEST FOR YOU. BEST FOR ME? BY MAKING ME FEEL LIKE A PRISONER IN MY OWN HOME? WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT? I'M TALKING ABOUT THE PRESS, MAN! THEY ALL OVER MY ASS! THEY ASKING QUESTIONS, THEY'RE TAKING PICTURES. DAMN, MAN. I'M LIKE A GODDAMN PRISONER IN MY OWN HOUSE! I APOLOGIZE. I NEVER MEANT IT TO TURN OUT LIKE THIS FOR YOU. YOU KNOW WHAT THE WORST PART IS? MAN, THE WORST PART IS I TRUSTED YOU, MAN. I BEEN READING PEOPLE MY WHOLE LIFE, BUT I REALLY SCREWED UP WITH YOU BECAUSE YOU'RE A LIAR. YOU'RE LIVING A LIE, BUT I BELIEVED YOU. IT WASN'T ALL A LIE, JAKE. THE MUSIC STUFF, MY SON. I DID HIT ROCK BOTTOM. I GUESS THAT'S WHERE THE TRUTH ENDED. COME ON, JAKE. TAKE THE CHECK. SEE, THAT'S YOUR PROBLEM. YOU THINK IT'S ALL ABOUT THE MONEY. I GOT TO GO, CAM, OR PHILLIP OR WHATEVER THE FUCK YOUR NAME IS. WHERE ARE YOU OFF TO, JAKE? OH. I'LL BE AROUND, YOU KNOW, DENYING MY EXISTENCE. VERONICA. [CHURCH BELLS RINGING] [NO AUDIO] HEY, YOU! YEAH, YOU. WHAT ARE YOU DOING OUT HERE? WHY DON'T YOU GET YOUR ASS OVER TO A SHELTER? I'M HERE FOR MY PARADE. HERE FOR YOUR WHAT? MY PARADE. YOUR PARADE?
