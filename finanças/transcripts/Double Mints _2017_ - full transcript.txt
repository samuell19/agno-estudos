How's it going? Good. As expected. It's nearly done. Right, right. You can leave first if you want. I'll finish up. Really? Sorry. It's like I'm pushing this onto you. Something suddenly came up... Sorry. You're too nice on him. Isn't it fine? We've been staying late everyday lately. Yes, hello. Mitsuo-kun? I'm sorry, who is this? It's Mitsuo. Mitsuo... Mitsuo-kun? Come here now. I killed a woman. You're smart, right? Do something. First... Let's get rid of the body. Let's go to the mountain. If the two of us dug a hole, I think we can hide a woman's body. We'll need tools, shovels. Mitsuo-kun. You're noisy. It really has been a while. - Naruyama Ryoko? - Yes. Then, the boys. Adachi Kenji. Yes. Such low energy. It's your first day of school. - Nigami Ataru. - Yes. Ichikawa Mitsuo. - Yes. - Yes. You have the same first and last names? Ah but the kanji is different... What should I do in this case? Um... Then... The Ichikawa with 'numbers'? Yes. Yes. The Ichikawa with 'city'? Yes. Yes. - Ihara Kosuke. - Yes. Micchan, you sure do some horrible things. And to someone with the same name! So cruel! You're a demon! The devil! Yeah! You're no joke, Micchan. Adachi. Yes. - Iguchi. - Yes. Ichikawa. Where's Ichikawa? One Ichikawa is here, right? Yes. Where's the other one? Who knows. Is he skipping? I thought he'd be more serious. It's so hot~ Today's lesson is the worst. I know, vault jumping is so much trouble. And why do we have to bring these? He's ordering us around. How do we carry these anyway? One by one? He says we won't vault jump today, bring the mat instead. - Really? - For real? Say it sooner! Well, but... The mat is still... Grab that side. One, two.. Ah, it's heavy. That side okay? We have carry this vertically. - Can we? - Should we call someone? Nah, we can do it. Are you sure? Ah, we did it. - Hold on, help. - Close the door. Should I let you out, Mitsuo? If you promise to obey me forever, I'll let you out of here. Be my dog. Okay. Dogs don't speak. Woof. One more time. Woof. Don't you ever forget this! That ring... This? It's cheap. Cause she kept saying she wanted a matching pair. Chicks really dig... ...shit like this, don't they. You should throw it away. Yeah. Mitsuo-kun, you dig, too. She's yours, isn't she. I feel sick. You promised, didn't you. That you'd obey me forever. You're my dog. Damn you. Selfishly dying on me. Hey. You do it. Don't go back to Tokyo until it's afternoon. As I thought... It's impossible. I'm turning myself in. What are you saying? It's impossible. I... I didn't mean to kill her. I... I loved her! Oi, what are you doing! The hell!? Oi, Mitsuo! I'll kill you! Kill me then. Huh? You can barely stand. Oi. Oi! Found a cutie! - Are you hitting on me~? - What are you up to? I'm not~ I'm waiting for my boyfriend. Boyfriend? Forget him~ No, let go! You're really my type but I can't today~ - Why not today? - Cause I have a boyfriend! Wait! - You'll make him mad. - Why? What is this? You're her boyfriend? Mitsuo-kun! Stop it! Don't be jealous~ Oi, don't fuck with me! Die, asshole! Drop dead! Ow! - Don't fuck with me! I'll kill you! - That hurt! Asami? Asami? Asami? Asami! - I think I drank too much. - You drank too much again~? Oi, come on. Wake up. How much did you drink... You're gonna be okay. You just drank too much. Are you kidding me? Found anything? Nothing. Did you really bury her here? There's no doubt. There were signs of a dug hole, right? Weren't you just drunk and dreamed about it? Like hell. Then how did you get here? My friend drove me... That's right, the ring! I buried a ring with her. Did you find it? If you say any more shit we're not letting you off. Everyone, great work! We're stopping here, sorry. Sorry. What is the meaning of this... Sorry. Sorry. Let's go. You... We're letting you go now, but we won't let you off next time. But I'm telling the truth... Punk... Yes. Good work. It's Nakaoka-san. You didn't have to come here. It's no big deal. This kid... He's an underling from "that group" right? Underling... More like an errand boy they use here and there. We went all the way up the mountain, too. He must've been drunk. He says he buried the corpse and everything... But in the end there was no corpse, was there!? How unfortunate. Can I light a cigarette? No way in hell. I'm sorry. Mitsuo, you wait here. What the hell. I was apologizing. How cocky. Saeki-san... Thank you very much! Just sleep. Here. I... I... I'm sorry! Who do you think you're talking to? You were all beaten by the Murakawa Group... Well, well. Okuda. You were beaten up this bad... And you ran your mouth. Telling them all about our group. Can't help it. I... didn't say... If I was beat up this bad... Even I would've croaked. Can't help it. Good work. What are you doing? Call the police. And tell them you did it. You okay? Want me to call an ambulance? Mitsuo, come. Yes. How do you plan on finishing off the Murakawa Group? Let's look at their next move first. They might try and buy themselves out. I don't see you in a week, and now here you are. I'm sorry. If you're taking a break, contact us. Yeah. Not "yeah"! Yes. Then. You can start working again, right? Yes. Ichikawa-san, um... Someone's here to see you. Who is it? He says he's with the police... The police? Yes... Okay, thanks. Yes. Ah, Ichikawa-san. Nice to meet you, I'm Nakaoka from the Shinjuku PD. It's a wonderful company. Can I see your badge? Ah, excuse me. Please, come in. Should we change places? It's fine. It's not like I did anything. Go ahead. Do system engineers earn a lot? So-so, I guess. By the way, don't police officers work in pairs? Or is that just in TV dramas? No, that's usually how it is. But I don't work well with others... I work better alone. This time especially. Right. You look like you don't have friends. In a drunk fit, he accidentally killed a woman. Then he buried her body with his friend in the mountain. He buried the matching ring they bought, too. Do you know what this is about? Who knows. That guy's always drunk. Are you married? How about you? Excuse me. That's quite a nice ring. It is, right? I really like it. Then please excuse me. Really? I'll come again. Sure, please come anytime. I'll be your friend. Oh, Mitsuo. You have a guest. Thanks for the other day. Sit down. Yes. What did you want to talk about? I just came to see his face today. Then fucking go to Mitsuo's place! Pipe down! What a cute face. Can I ask you something? What is it? The world of yakuza is nothing but men, right? You know, like, temptations-wise. Or in other words... Is intercourse between males considered normal? Is it that good, I wonder? What is? A man's body. What are you trying to say, fucker!? Stop. So that's what you mean. Well... To each their own, I guess. I'll leave you two alone. Let's go. Don't officers work in pairs? Or is that just in TV dramas? The other Mitsuo-san asked me the same thing. When you have the same name... Are you connected like twins are? You went to see Mitsuo? Do you remember this ring? Look. It's the matching ring you bought. Mitsuo-kun! We found it. The woman's body! Saeki-san. You're carrying quite the burden when the group is undergoing some rough times. Well then. Mitsuo. Where the fuck did you hide the body? They found her. An officer came by with her ring... Don't fuck with me... This is cause you hid it someplace shitty, right! What do I do... This is all your fault. It's all your fault! Calm down. That was fake. You've got nothing to worry about. Don't worry. Just do something. Mitsuo-kun? Then I'll contact you later. Hey, who is it? It's not a woman, right? Hang up already. Did it last long? Well, we went through a lot. What do you mean? Mitsuo-kun? Cut it out, Mitsuo-kun! I'll call the cops! Explain this, Mitsuo. You can see for yourself, can't you? She wasn't dead. It was close, though. She lost consciousness, and she was dehydrated. After you left I dug her back up and cleaned her up. I gave her some water and let her sleep, the next day she woke up just fine. I have no idea what you're talking about. Wait, what is this? What is it? I just explained things roughly to her, I told her she just drank too much. Hey... Wait, wait... What is this? Apparently she drank so much that night she doesn't remember anything. What do you mean "that night"? Lucky, right. Hey... Wait, wait! You taste like Mitsuo-kun, after all! You're gross! Why did you do all this? I wanted to get a hold of your weakness. That's not it, is it? You wanted to piss me off... So I'll do something nasty to you, right? You pervert! It's all because of you... Your eyes... Seriously... Stop this... I have no idea what's going on between you two... It's gross- What was that! Scram. I'll kill you. I'm leaving! Suck it. You really are a dog. Orange juice, no ice. Matching looks today? Officer, you can have this. Good work. Remember what I said last time? Let's go on a date. She said the others might come with their boyfriends. Mitsuo-kun, are you listening? Yeah. What's wrong? Is there someone else you like...? Of course not. Can I go to your place next time? No. Wait until my birthday. I want my first time to be special. Micchan! Oi, Micchan! Hurry! Sorry, sorry. It was funny. You know those free syrups in family restaurants? I can make calpis with that. This guy keeps drinking calpis from that. It's seriously stupid. You idiot. It's Ichikawa. Nice timing! What are you doing? Way to go. She's cute! Are you going out? You are!? - Since when? - You guys! Seriously? What's good about him? When did you start going out? With that girl from the other day. You mean Ricchan? Ah, so she's Ricchan. Rina? Risa? Rika? Ritsuko? Ritsuko. - Ritsuko? - Ritsuko. So, since when? Around the end of 8th grade. Did you do it already? Mitsuo-kun? Huh? Who is it? A delivery. They got the address wrong. Do you like music? Did you think it was Mitsuo? Even though you have the same name, you're completely different! Of course. That guy's a closeted pervert. No way. Mitsuo-kun is? Yeah. Your nails are so pretty. This? A girl from my class is good at it. Show me more. I'm done. Mitsuo-kun? Why? Wait... Wait... It's fine already. It's fine. Before we end this... No... No... Be quiet. Good day, everyone. Today, the fourth lecture on philosopher Plato's feast. Let's recall the contents we've gone through. Phaedrus thought that Eros should be respected, as he is the oldest god, and for he is the origin of virtue and all that is good, and the one with power to bestow happiness. Should I save some for you? Since I've been in your care lately. I'm good. I ain't giving you any, idiot~ So sleepy~ Turn the boring TV off already. In the past, it was believed there were three types of humans. Men, women, and the half men and half female. They were called the "androgynous." They had four arms and four legs, two heads, and two reproductive organs. The androgynous were very arrogant, so one day, god separated them into two, and they spend all eternity looking for their other half. As the third type, they were often referred to as bisexuals, but what are they really? Me and Mitsuo-kun, we must have been... ...one body. One that was separated. You're dangerous. Mitsuo-kun! That's enough. Yes. Mitsuo-kun... Mitsuo-kun. Mitsuo... You had a lackey? How very cocky of you. Who are you people? Stop... What's with you people! Mitsuo. Mitsuo? You're called Mitsuo too? What a pain in the ass. Simply put... He was lifting from the profits. Huh? Oi. What's wrong? Oi! He passed out? What should I do with this... This is a problem. I had a job for him tomorrow. You wanna do it? I'm sorry. - Thank you. - No problem. Hello. How is it? I'm done. Where are you right now? In front of the house. Hold on. Someone will come. Ichikawa-san. Not working today? Oi! Here's your fee. I bought it on the way. Would you like some? You've got guts. Shopping in the middle of a job? A souvenir for Mitsuo, huh. You're weird. I'll give you, Mr. Helper, a special bonus that I'm sure you'll enjoy. A first-unveiled, uncensored DVD. It's some academy award-worthy work, you know. Is this recording? If the red light is on, it is. Let's get started. I'm really sorry! Stand up, fucker! Look. What's wrong? Oi! Please forgive me, Saeki-san! Saeki-san! Here I go. Don't move. Saeki-san... Saeki-san... You saw? I did. Mitsuo-kun! Mitsuo... You look horrible. I thought you were gonna die... Water... I did. I died... ...and came back to life. Come here. Closer. Closer. This morning, a shootout happened in Tokyo's Toshima ward. The victim was 47-year-old Ikegami Tatsuji-san, a member of the violent "A" Group. The shootout occured in Ikegami-san's apartment, and as of now, the perpetrator is out on the loose and yet to be found. The police claims they've started investigations... It's finally begun. You guys should be careful. Yes. Mitsuo, sit. Yes. You want out? Even if you say that, you weren't even a member to begin with. Just slowly fade and disappear. So why? That's exactly why I want a clean break. I see. Bring that over. You've done a lot for me... So... I'm thankful, but, I don't want to leave any loose ends. So you want closure, huh. Here you are. I see. Then I might as well have you do one last job for me. You're kind of a part-timer, too, so it's perfect for you. You don't have to hit them. Just shoot around and scare them. Do yakuzas do that? That's no good. No, no, no. Is that what they do? I've never seen that. Who're you? Oi, what's up with you, punk. You lost? Are you listening? Brat! What are you doing here!? Can you hear us!? Your ears work!? What's your problem! If you've got no business here then scram! Fuck off or we'll kill you! Oi! You messing with us? Let's see... Like this? Ow... It hurts... Don't shoot me for real... Hello, Mitsuo-kun? Mitsuo, where are you right now? I just got home. You? Mitsuo-kun? Never mind. Mitsuo-kun? I knew you'd show up here! Oh my, how horrible you look. What's with you! You sure were flashy. You still have it, right? Shut up! You're just being used by those yakuza... You won't be held responsible! Mitsuo-san. Mitsuo-san! Mitsuo-san! Mitsuo-san! Mitsuo-san! The other Mitsuo-san must be worried! Shut up! Let's stop this. I know you're a decent guy! Let's just... Stay away... Stay away! Stay away! Stay away! Next. Today, in regards to the shootout that occured, the police are charging the suspect, Ichikawa Mitsuo, for attempted murder and illegal possession of firearms, and consider him a fugitive. The suspect is still on the run, and just moments ago in Shinjuku, he was also in a shootout with a police officer, and is now being pursued. Damn it... Mitsuo-kun, where are you? Yes. Oh, doggy. It's your master. He made quite a bit of trouble. There it is. Mitsuo-kun? Mitsuo-kun! Calm down, doggy. He's just out from the meds. What... What the hell did you make him do!? It seems his leg was shot when he was running away. When he was running away...? His leg was shot? Way to blow things out of proportion. Why... It's all your fault! Hey... There's an injured person here. You got him involved and treated him as an expendable... And made him a criminal! That's not right, doggy. This guy... He was from our world to begin with. Mitsuo-kun? Mitsuo-kun... Mitsuo-kun? Mitsuo-kun! Why...? Why is he here? I told you not to tell him, didn't I!? Why...! Ow... You're both so loud. Be thankful I got a doctor to take care of you. You wanted closure, right? Stay here for now. I'll contact you later. I should go too. You should sleep in my room. Thank you. That guy... Is he dead? We don't know yet. He's dead? I killed him... Mitsuo-kun, it's okay... Shut up! Or I'll kill you! Kill me then. I will! I will...! I... You... Hey. That talk about the round humans on TV. Do you remember? Yeah. Separated in half by god in his anger, and since then... Humans yearn for the other half they've lost. And wish for their other half. Mitsuo. Hey. Now that the two separate parts have become one again... What happens? The two halves are holding on to each other... Combine, and roll around like a ball... Where are we going? Where can we go? Mitsuo-kun? Mitsuo-kun? Mitsuo-kun! Mitsuo-kun! Mitsuo-kun! Why do you always disappear!? Mitsuo-kun! Hello? Where is Mitsuo-kun? You know, right? He says he wants to cut off ties with you. Is he there? He's not here. Let's say goodbye, doggy. This is his wish. He can't come back here. He doesn't want to drag you with him, so he disappeared. You understand, right? You're the one that doesn't understand. What was that? I can tell the cops everything about the shootout, you know. Do you know what you're saying? Of course I'm not planning to. But it isn't about if I do or don't, it's that if I want to, I could. There's only one think I ask. Where is Mitsuo-kun right now? It's him. It's too windy today. It's cold. I'm going in this? The Mitsui route is the best, so... Damn you. Don't fuck with me! Leave! I said don't come here! Now I can't go back either! What are you doing? That's dangerous. I'm Kim from the Huang family. Once you're in Korea, go in the land route. It's going to be rough. Your brothers will be waiting. What did he say? No idea. It's brighter now. Painkillers. It's yours, right? Just drink it. Did you drink it? Yeah. Mitsuo. Will you die with me?
