What do you mean wrong? She's been staying with us for about three weeks and I haven't heard her speak Maybe she is a mute Come on, be serious Sorry, yeah go on I don't know what to do If I can only figure out who she is Francis, do you have any idea? I'm sure you are wrong Otis has too much sense for that kind of thing Oh well he is a man isn't he? She is probably 19 and has huge tits! Estelle! Francis spends all her time with Karen and I'm getting tired of it She knows Karen is unbalanced and needs help, but won't admit it She said she is shy, because she is different What do you think? I think she needs a Psychiatrist Francis says no She's a wise lady She said it would scandalize the Compton name Really, you can't be serious That calls for another double Maybe you can talk to her Sure I can talk to her It will be my great pleasure to talk with her You know Don, that is one mighty pretty lady You know I say to Estelle all the time I say look how pretty Francis is Don't I Don? You're in great shape I'll call ya tomorrow Try not to break anything when you hit the floor You know she's my best friend We even went to school together In fact I introduced her to Don Otis, would you stop it I am trying to think Listen, my husband, your wife are here and Estelle knows What about Estelles nose? I'm not drunk Fran, really here I'll show you Will you stop it? What are you crazy? Look Either you leave me alone, or you will have to leave I love you Franny, you said you couldn't get along without me I'll leave Estelle I'm going inside I think you should go home an affair is not like a marriage it ends If you want to stay our friend don't ruin this party I'm sorry I don't want to hurt you Good night Otis Fran How long has this affair been going on? You can't be serious, Otis is one of my oldest friends Aha, you knew who I was talking about, that proves it That proves nothing I think he just had a little too much to drink tonight, that's all I think the party went very well don't you? Elliot seemed very taken with your ideas do you think you will get the contract? Fran, lets not talk about business You know I find it very stimulating that other men find you attractive Sometimes I forget how beautiful you really are Thank you kind sir Fran you are a cock stirring sight Donald, don't be disgusting Disgusting? Do you find it disgusting that I find you so damned attractive? Come here wench, let me make love to you Alright, let's get it over with. Is that a way to talk to a husband that wants to cherish your body? Donald I know you You use sex when you are trying to avoid something Well that is not very complimentary to either one of us You are right, there is something I want to talk about Oh really? Not Otis again? It's Karen. I'm running out of excuses for her Our friends know she lives here, no one is allowed to see her Fran it's like having a monster hidden away in the attic It's really embarrasing Well isn't that too damn bad! Look let's not fight about it All I am saying is something has to be done The girl isn't well. Well what do you want me to do? Throw her out in the street? Have the state support her? I promised father when he died I would take care of her Well the best thing you can do is get some professional help anyway that is what Otis thinks It's not my field, but I think it's beyond that Oh you think so do you? and Otis thinks whatever he thinks Who in the hell asked him? The girl probably needs to be hospitalized. I told you before I am not having any one in the Compton family put into a mental institution. Francis, Otis is an analyst I think he is qualified Try and be reasonable I am totally reasonable Karen is just tired She needs her rest She's getting worse everyday I think she needs a doctor You don't want her here, you don't want her at the beach really I don't know what you want from me This is what I want It has been a long time A very long time Karen isn't here now is she? No Need I say more? Poor Francis, it's been so long, she forgot how Just because I am not a sex maniac like you Don That feels good You know you are right, we should do this more often Any time Madam As you can see and feel, I am always at your disposal Darling, let's have a baby Baby?

Unless you don't live here Maybe you just got tired of walking down the beach and you are crashing here Ok It's none of my business But you don't have to be afraid I am not gonna hurt you I mean look at you, you are shivering You must be ice cold You wanna put my hat on? You know you are ten percent warmer with a hat on I know because I work emergency year round winter storms, sleet storms Hey! (loud weird noises) You know what I am gonna do?

Ok Just don't cut yourself Wanna help me build a fire? Chop some wood with that big knife? Karen What, what's that? Karen? My name is Karen Well, see we are really getting someplace Karen That is a very pretty name You know, if someone came in here right now they would get completely the wrong idea Little Karen was being a bad girl with a big strong man I could be a murder, or a rapist, or your secret lover, or anything But I'm not You know I got this crazy idea that I am not a man, alone in a deserted house, on an empty island with a beautiful woman I'm just your big brother just protecting my poor little sister This is really a weird one nothing to fear from Larry the Letch wait till the guys hear this Well, we can be warm Here, in about two minutes, you will be as warm as a cat Well this is cozy isn't it? It's a little weird, but it's cozy You know when I was a kid, my family used to take me to a little beach house, it was a beach shack not a house. I would stay there all summer with my mother (drowned out by weird noises) Hey Karen, what is this? I am your big brother remember? I have never taken advantage of a lady in distress and I am not going to start now What is wrong Larry? Don't I appeal to you? Certainly a big stud like you, couldn't be afraid of a little girl like me I don't know what's going on here, but I know I don't like it First you're hot and then you're cold, then you're ten years old, and then you're an old whore? Well I think you're nuts So what if I am I am still a woman Why don't you give it to me Larry, I'll show you how What the hell? I get paid by the hour Is that what you want Karen? Feels good? That's good That's how you do it Larry Plunge it in deeper You like that? Feels good? I like to see you have fun. Oh rub me hard Larry Should I do it a little faster? Like that? I got plenty more. I am big and I'm strong It's all for you Karen All for pretty little Karen That's it. You getting there? You getting there Karen? Good, well I don't feel much like your big brother anymore You like it? Yeah it's good, I can tell you like it You gonna come soon, you gonna come soon? I've got all you need You like it? Is that what you want? Should I got faster? Yeah like that? Is that good? Is that what you like? You like that? Do ya? Ok That's it Larry, that's how Ooo that's how you give it to me Try one of these, it's a new recipe crab meat and sour cream Ugh, that sounds disgusting No one is forcing them down your throat, dear I'll choose to ignore her Hey let me tell you two what's happened My alma mater has asked me to deliver a series of lectures next semester on the subject of breasts Are we going to talk about Karen, or aren't we? Hey Karen, feel good? Yeah Good, now it's my turn, lay down Yeah, lay down, that's the way we do it Karen You get yours, and I get mine! I don't want to! Sure you do Noooo (dark music) Well off hand, from what I know about the case I'd say there is probably nothing seriously wrong with her Sounds a little removed Personally I find that refreshingly unpretentious The Dr. Vorel method of double talk But if you insist I can recommend a top man in the field Could you call him for us tomorrow? Now wait a minute, I haven't agreed to this yet Well what are you waiting for? It can't hurt Karen and it might help her and as for the good Compton name It will be kept so quiet, that the doctor himself won't know she is Well I guess I have no choice What do you think Otis? Do you think it's a good idea? Well that's hard to say without further observation She probably needs a little rest, you know to calm her nerves God help the mentally ill well I need another drink Looks like rain, I think we better goin (knocking) Hello! Anybody there? Is somebody home! It's only me, Mrs. Grudkow I live up the beach Leaving ever light on in the house! In the middle of the day. Selfish! Everybody today is just selfish! Haven't you ever heard of the energy crisis? I am going to have to have a word with these people. (roll out the barrels (We will have a barrel of fun) (Roll out the barrels we've got the blues on the run) (Zing boom tararrel, sing out a song of good cheer) (Now's the time to roll the barrel, for the gang's all here) I used to be in the chorus in college you know Second alto I would have never guessed except you have told me one hundred times Thanks for the compliment, my own husband Now now children, no fighting Francis, are you gonna serve us dinner or are we gonna sit here and starve to death? Are physical pleasures all you think about? Yes!

But know I see it's you dear Are you alright? I mean are you all alone here? I mean everyone else is gone All the houses are closed for the season You are a very brave girl aren't you dear I mean my late husband, God rest that mans soul used to always say, that a woman alone is like a foot without a shoe You know I've never seen this house before I'll bet it's as beautiful inside as it is out there Oh let me see Would you like to come in? Oh yes it is beautiful up here Isn't it? You know I thought it would be like this with the beams and all You know when I first saw all the lights on I couldn't figure out what kind of place it could be You really don't need all these lights on darling, you have all this perfect sunshine coming right in, we all have to do something about conserving energy Everyone must do his bit in this world. There isn't that a lot better? You don't mind if I rest do ya? I've been walking all day on the beach and it really gets to ya Oh... Sand all over your table You aren't very neat are ya?

It's on fire Fannie It wants to get rubbed, I want to get fucked. You ever feel like that Fanny? You're crazy, you let me out of here! I thought you wanted to see the rest of the house? I could show it to you (laughing) Wanted to see the house? Hey did I do something right? No I did, Prescott signed the contract and we moved the complex to London Now what do you think of your husband? They've asked me to come out almost immediatly so I can start the preliminary plans so I guess we will be leaving as soon as we can close out the apartment Just think of it, Hyde Park, the pubs, the Queen of England You know Francis, I think, I have always wanted to live abroad Hey love, what's the matter? You seem to have lost your enthusiasm What about Karen? Well what about her? Did you make an appointment for her yet? No Well now is the perfect time to make that decision once and for all Either commit her to an institution or let her take care of herself She is old enough How can you be so cruel, you know I will never leave without Karen Francis please be reasonable, We can't take Karen with us Now if you don't go with me I'll have to turn down the job. You know I can't let you do that Alright, I'll call her, I'll make the appointment But I am not leaving here, without knowing she is being taken care of That's my reasonable girl. I only hope it's not too late Why should it be too late? That's strange, where would she be at this time of night? (strange sounds) I want us to be happy, the way we used to be I just want my wife back Poor guy, has it really been that hard on you? I've missed you I know you are always worrying and thinking about her You know I am really starting to get worried, Karen hasn't answered the phone in two days. Oh I am sure she is alright, Otis doesn't think there anything to worry about I suppose you are right Look at this, it's amazing junk you pick up in ten years of marriage I supposed I will end up throwing most of this away I can't see Don paying storage on all this junk Never, not a chance (strange sounds) YOu! oww!! Come on Tommy, let's eat, you promised me a picnic on the beach remember? Come on let's go I'm tired, can't you let a guy rest? Look I'm hungry, I haven't had anythin to eat since breakfast Is this what's its gonna be like when we get married? It'll be worse than this, you asked me remember? Ok let's go.

In the middle of a public beach? Do you want us to get arrested? and besides I'm freezing Can't we go back, please? How about that house over there?

Seems pretty quiet Yeah it does Yeah I guess there really isn't anybody here. Nope, closed for the season Oh Tom, I am so excited I've never made love in a deserted house before Yeah it might be a little Kinky.

I am leaving right now Look honey, even if there is something wrong, what good could you do? Estelle do you think Otis could be imposed upon to bring Karen back to the city? I wouldn't normally ask, but you can see how upset Francis is. Oh I am sure he wouldn't mind at all Don, I'll call right away, but I can't guarantee I'll find him there Dr. Vorel please His wife Hello Karen It's me Otis, remember? You don't want to talk to me do you Karen? I'll bet you don't want to talk to anybody You don't like intruders do you Karen? You don't have to be afraid of me You can trust me I am not going to hurt you. I am not going to take anything. Maybe we could talk a little, make you feel better? Would you like that Karen?

I can't understand why Francis is so upset I can't see where she got the... Oh Jeez She got the idea that you were in such desperate trouble You know sometimes our relatives create problems where they dont because of their own inadequacies You seem perfectly normal to me in fact better than normal Well I can't sit around here all day, I better get back to Francis report that her sister is perfectly sane You know I never had a better day in my life I am gonna take a shower, why don't you fix us some coffee huh? Karen, please please, now I have to leave sorry.
