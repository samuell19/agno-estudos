What I remember most is coming home when it was dark and cold. My fingers and toes hurt so bad, I thought they might fall off. Sometimes I got real scared because I was all alone. I remember getting home and mom would make me something warm. My dad would make this big fire and rub my hands and feet, and then... I was saved. What time is it? It's Saturday. Then I can go back to sleep. Yeah, go back to sleep. I'm still sleeping. I'm sleeping, too. Are you still sleeping? Mm-hmm. Should I lock the door? It's locked. Yeah. [Giggling] Did dad say you could use that? I asked him. Here, could you test it for me? Yeah, sure. You ready? Yeah. [Buzz] I'm selling girl scout cookies. You like them with or without razorblades? Thank you. Matt. Oh, my god, it's stuck. Chris, let me out. Hello. Is your mother home? Come on, Chris! I'm serious. It's not opening. Shh! You're going to wake your dad. Chris is being mean and we're hungry. Will you fend for yourself? I'll be out in a minute. Your night thing is wrong. Sometimes I wear it like this. God is great, god is good... Matt, would you keep it down? I'm trying to read the sports page. And we thank him for our food. Amen. Mom, these eggs are extremely slimy. [Refrigerator rattling] Dad just touches something in the back, and it stops. Don't put your hand back there. You can get electrocuted. You know, it actually happened to somebody. [Rattling] [Rattling stops] Did you take the seeds out of my orange juice? Yes. I strained it this thing still doesn't work. John, the new tiles came yesterday. I have to go down to the site for a few hours. You said you'd do it this weekend. Tomorrow. It'll be a great new kitchen. It was a great old kitchen, remember when we had walls? Tomorrow. First thing. You want to drive to the site? Yeah. Give me the keys. Beth, what did you do with my sunglasses? What did I do with them? Open that. I know I gave them to you. He did give them to you. Thank you. Yeah? [Chris] They simply disappeared. Oh... Would you find them for me? Hup! Thanks for breakfast, mom. Great. Later, creator. [Car engine starts] It's got a nice fit, really. Excellent. Keep up the good work, alright? This thing has to be poured Monday morning. John, I'm pumping now. I'll have you roughed in tonight. Don't fool around with me. Hi, dad! [Car approaching] Where have you been? We went to the movies. You weren't in. It was a great movie. There was this fat kid, and he had never done it. His friends got him this prostitute. John. They watched him from a closet while he did it. But it was interesting and educational too, because it had this really good story. This kid had this dream to have a mustang. It was like flashdance but not as deep. It was good, mom. It was excellent. What does it mean when a girl says "I'm late"? I don't get it. I'm late. John. There were prostitutes in this movie, but it wasn't about prostitutes. [Telephone rings] What was it about, John? It was about guys and coming of age and growing up. Guys. It was cute. It was shit. [Chris] Dad, phone! Beth, you're making a very big deal out of this. It was nothing. Come on, John, admit it. You're always doing this. The backhoe operator hit a main. I have to get down there. Oh, can't someone else go? Ok, you go. Oh, very funny. There is no one else. I'll be back as soon as I can. Give the kids some dinner, ok? It could go on a while. We'll wait. Mom, can you come out here? Not now, Matty. I'm busy. Mom, you'd better come out here. Evan? Beth... There's been an accident. Is John alright? He's at the hospital. There was an explosion. Is John ok? Excuse me. Yes? I'm looking for my husband. Is he a patient? No. A visitor? No. Um... I... see, I've come to identify him. He's deceased? You want the estelle Simon wing.

[Laughter] Hey, you! Piggy face! Hey, Matt, you want a plate? Ok. I'll get you a couple of meatballs. Um, I'd like to give you a number. This is a counselor that my mother saw after my father died. You don't have to use it. Thanks. Buy yourself something, something really expensive. You'd be surprised. Excuse me. [Children shouting] ♪ ♪ I wanted to put my arms around him. I didn't. I was about to cry. I didn't want... I was embarrassed. All my friends were there. I didn't want to break down or something. No one could do what he does. Just... you know, it's like he... He's, like, in charge of everything, and... he runs everything. How could you get by without him? Oh, my god. [Crying] Oh, take it easy. I'm not going to cry. Matty, it's good to cry. I'm not going to cry. Why not? Because. Tell John's subs you can't write any checks until the estate is out of probate. Ok? Now, I'm coming up with the figure of $63,000. That's what John owes. Jesus Christ. Well, that's everything. That's carpenters, electricians, masons, sheet metalist, everyone... all there. What about life insurance? Well, I'll get a job. Beth, we're talking about $63,000. Well, a good job. I think that's a great idea. Maybe we know somebody. Gary? I have a customer whose sister runs a chain of these fancy food stores in Baltimore. They sell gourmet spaghettis. But it's in Baltimore. That's a two-hour commute. No, I'm not going to move. I'll find something here. I know I will. Something good. I will. Oh... Oh, Beth. Hi. Laura. Hi. How are you? I haven't seen you since, uh... How are you doing? How are the boys? Fine, fine. We're all fine. Great. Yeah. I have a job. Oh, great. Really? Doing what?

[Engine starts] Maryland state lottery presents the big spin with this week's lucky winner. Please help me welcome Mr. Richard hoverty. Chris? Yo. Hey, can you come down here? Yo? Chris, this is Sam Burrows. He's the manager of the store. He's interested in buying the truck. Where is the truck? The truck's not for sale. Well, actually, honey, it is. Well, actually, honey, it's not. Chris, where is the truck? I don't know, Sam. I'm sorry I dragged you all the way out here. Don't worry about it, ok? Christopher Michael! Folks, luck is really nothing more than preparation meeting opportunity. How dare you talk to me like that! You're not selling the truck. That is not for you to say! It's not fair! Dad said it was going to be mine! Where is the truck, Chris? What are you doing? You don't smoke. You want to die of cancer? Tell me where the truck is, honey. No. Sell something else. What? Something of yours, for instance. How about that? Well, it's all mine. What about that? The car, the truck, the house, the bills, the debts, you and Matt... He left it all to me. You can't do anything till the estate's out of probate, remember? Come on! [Cheering] I've never won anything before in my life. Thanks for joining us. We'll see you next week on the million-dollar minute! Don't forget to buy your tickets! [Speaking cantonese] [Clatter] [Dog barking] What was that noise? Raccoons. What are you doing up? Raccoons. We have to have a talk. You know, in the past, when things... when we had problems, we'd work them out. We didn't have problems in the past. Oh, sure we did, but there were two of us then, and we worked them out together. You boys were young, and that's what parents do. But now... Now I need your help. Does that scare you? It doesn't scare me. It doesn't scare me. Well, good. [Kettle whistles] Now, here's the thing. The last couple of weeks, I've been a little worried, just a little bit, about money, you know, because we don't have a whole lot of it, and I was wondering... I was thinking... What you might think if I sold the house. Where would we live? You're selling the house? This house? My house? Our house, yes. Forget it. If we move, I could get a better job. Why can't you get a better job here? We could live in a place that has a real kitchen with walls and a landlord who fixes things when they're broken. Would I have to change schools? Forget it. No way. I didn't tell you the best part yet. This is stupid! You know where I think we should move? To Baltimore. No way. Forget it. Now, I know how much you both like Baltimore because it's got wonderful stores and restaurants, and you're always wanting to go there. No. We were lying. What do you want me to do, huh? Do you want food and clothes? I'm selling the house because we need the money. Why didn't you save for a rainy day? Well, we did save some. You know, your father worked very hard, and we own this house. He took real good care of us, and he was a good father. If either of you ever say anything at all... I didn't mean that. I don't know what else to do. Well... Maybe you could get a good job. Maybe you could make a lot of money. Then maybe we can come back. Think we'll ever be able to come back? Maybe. [Engine starts] Sometimes you got to let it warm up for a few minutes. I wouldn't take it to any of those car washes. Those brushes can really screw up the paint job. I won't be washing it that much. Just a truck, right? Children feel right at home in this house. Notice the original flooring, the original woodwork, and that lovely carved molding? The kitchen is right in there. The dishwasher has already been installed, and the stove... [Doorbell buzzes] [Buzz] [Siren] [Jackhammer drilling] [Shouting in Spanish] Where to? Yeah, um... Just down the hall. That, that, that second bedroom will be real good. Thanks. This is a swell place, mom. They even have suicideproof windows. Why are there so many locks on the doors? To keep us from escaping back to our real house, where we should be living. Just try to be helpful, Chris. Mom, where do we eat? In the dining area, of course. That the part of the living room with the table and the bikes? Why don't you get a job in an air-conditioner store? It's hot in here. Why don't you go get us some cold drinks? Can I come with you? No, thank you. Ok. What are you doing? Bye. [Ding] [Ding] [Ding] [Ding] [Ding] [Ding] [Ding] [Ding] My little brother did that, pushed all the buttons. I didn't want you to think it was me. Why do you care what I think? I haven't exactly had this kind of experience before, but, um... I am interested in food. I love food. I know food. I, I, I eat food. Do you smoke? No, no, I don't, absolutely not. I never smoke. Annie, could you get me a pack of vantage ultra lights and a bottle of ramlosa? Thank you, babe. I was told you had some experience. Well, I could cook, and I could sell. I could learn to... I just wasn't up to breaking in a new girl. Ok. I'm sorry. Listen, I appreciate... Fuck it. You're here. Assistant manager, right? Yes. Yes. Great. This is what I want you to do... Run to the grocery. Get a head of lettuce, some strawberries, and two lemons. Lettuce, lemons, strawberries. Ok. Do you like doing this? No. Good. You feel like an idiot, Beth? Yes. Fine. The most fun thing I did this summer was that I went on a raft trip with my parents. My brother fell in the water and almost drowned. It was real fun. Uh, Matthew macauley. The most fun thing I did this summer was... Was... What was it, Matthew? The most fun thing I did this summer was, my ma took me to see something. That was the most fun thing. You didn't say anything about school today, Matty. I had fun. Mom, are you going to be working every day? Well, I have to, honey. I smell vomit. That's parmesan cheese, Matt. Smells like vomit. I heard you the first time. Chris, what are you walking like that for? I told you I got basketball tryouts. I got to stretch my achilles tendons. Be a lawyer. Lawyers make a lot of money. She can't just be a lawyer. I can if I want to. Sure, you can. I can be anything, Chris. I need you to believe in me. It's important that you have faith in me. I have faith in you. I have faith in you. Good. So now, what do we do? Pray? - You sure you don't mind? - Uh-uh. Good. Here's the address. It's a big building. Can't miss it. Well, maybe you can. Don't.

How long did I say we were separated? 14 months? Yeah. That's right. We don't have to talk about this. Oh, yeah. Perhaps we shouldn't. I mean, um, uh, unless, of course, you know, you want to. No. Oh. [Horn blows] So it wasn't an affair or anything. Yeah, it was. Not mine, unfortunately. Where were you? I've been waiting up. You said you were coming home, and you didn't. Where were you?

Those are some muffins I baked. Aren't we getting ambitious. When would you make these? Well, I bake sometimes when I can't sleep or if I need to relax or if I need to earn some extra money.

Does it feel like brillo? No, honey. It looks just fine. Hi. I'm Charles. You must be Matt. Something's wrong with the texture. Maybe some new creme rinse. Hi. I was just 40 or 50 blocks south, and I thought I'd stop in. Well, come on in. Great box collection. Well, we're still unpacking. It's taking us a while. Did you meet Matt? Yeah. He let me in. Did you say hello, Matt? Hello. Hello. Well, come on in. Oh, you know the six-month rule. Uh, anything still in the box six months after the move will stay in the box forever. Yeah. God, that was witty. God, I wish I would have said that. Matt, you play handball? No. I'll teach you. It's a great inner-city skill. [Crash] What's next, avoiding dog shit? Well, thank you, Chris. You remember Chris, don't you? Yeah. Your hair. What? Is something wrong with your hair? What are you talking about? I don't know. Maybe it's your creme rinse. Jesus! I'm out of here. Chris, what time are you coming home? I hate parties. Then why go? I don't know. It's warm in here. Oh. Well, I've been baking. Yeah. I saw. Ha ha ha! Let me have your wrist. Hmm? Just for a second. It's an old baker's trick. You feel anything? Yeah, sort of. Kind of. Not really. Huh. That's your napkin. You can use it. Oh, yeah. Thanks. I never cook for myself, but I love to cook for others. [Soft music playing] You cook? No. Never? Sometimes popcorn. What do you think we should do after dinner? After we eat? Mm-hmm. Dessert. After dessert. Well, we could go to a movie. You can't visit in a movie. All right. Um... We could make popcorn and watch TV. Here's what I thought... You finish dinner, and then we have dessert. Ok? All right. Then I take you for a drive, show you around the city. Sure. And after that, we come back here, and then, if we still like each other, we make love. Reese memorial's two blocks up. That's where I work. You want me to pull over? No. I'm fine, really, all right? You sure? Yeah. I have this thing about chicken, you know. Sometimes I faint when I eat it. You sure?

You're uncomfortable with my being here, and if I were really a nice guy, I'd let you off the hook and I'd leave. No. You really are. You are a nice guy. Look, I'm doing the best I can right now. I have to work... And I have to keep my boys together. Having an affair is not high on my list of priorities. If you don't get it, I'm sorry. I... I'm sorry. I made you feel bad. That's exactly the opposite of what I'm trying to do. I like you. I'd like to be closer to you. If it can't be physical, let's go bowling. Do you smoke?

So much for fun. Why don't you run out and get me some more basil? I don't run places, Lisa. If you want somebody to run for you, you should have hired a thoroughbred. Well, excuse me. The next time you ask me to run, babe, I'm gonna run out that door. I'm gonna keep running till I find another job. If that's offensive to you, then fire me. Okay, you're fired. What? You're fired. Hey, mama. Mom, I need a protractor. A what? I have a quiz tomorrow. Couldn't you have told me before? The stores are all closed. I told you last week. Couldn't you have reminded me? I remind you of everything now. I never used to have to. You never listen. I listen, Matthew. I listen to you. I listen to Chris. I listen to everybody. A protractor. That's that thing with the point, right? Oh, no, that's a compass. That's a half-moon thing, right? I'm not stupid. I went to high school. I'm artistic. I'm creative. You're home early. I'll get you a protractor. It doesn't matter that the stores are closed. I'll find a protractor store and I'll break in. Mom, this is Jody. She lives around here. Hello, Beth.

And if I can be of any assistance to you, please don't hesitate to get in touch. I'm pretty good at helping people. Bye, hon. Bye. Good to meet you, Beth. [Door closes] I don't remember giving you permission to have company... Hon. I didn't know I needed permission just to talk to someone. Hey, look. If you're going to be entertaining nurses, yes, you need my permission. You're damn right you need my permission. Dad wouldn't have cared. Dad isn't here, and I'm making the rules now.

You can have breakfast at home. Chris, I don't know what's going on here, but you are not to spend the night again. Beth, perhaps... Mrs. Macauley, hon. Mrs. Macauley, perhaps this isn't your decision to make. Oh, you don't think so? No, I don't. Come on. Right now, Chris. Mrs. Macauley, I know you're going through some personal problems... You're my problem. I know you have some problems. No, you're my problem! I'd like to help you. Where the hell did you get that shirt? Jody bought them for me. I kind of like them. God. Mrs. Macauley, I really don't want you in my house if you can't treat us with some degree of courtesy. Why don't you hit the streets and find a nice little 10-year-old, and then you can really go to town. Chris, I want you home. Tonight is family night. You will be with your family. Chris, did you set? No, not yet. Let's set the table. I'm ready to serve. From now on, every week, we'll be together, doing different things as a family. This is great. It's educational, too. Could we go now? Come on. We'll all share with each other our thoughts and experiences from the past week. So who wants to go first? All right. Well, then I'll go first. Well, I'm still looking for a job. I'm pretty hopeful that I'll find something next week. I don't want either of you to be afraid, but we should watch things for a while. Chris, if you feel you need, you know, more spending money, you might consider the possibility of getting a part-time job. I think the part-time job idea is a good one... Good. Because I'm moving in with Jody. The hell you are. You know, mom, remember we had that talk, and you told me I was going to have to become more of the man of the family? I guess that's just what happened. You're only 17. How are you going to support this girl? What about school? I'm still going to go to school and everything. She gets paid lots of money. She makes more than you. [Matt] How much? Uh, could I say something? It would make things easier for you, at least money-wise. How much does she make? Could I add something? Maybe it's not such a bad idea. I'll still be in the building. I can help out and stuff. This is not a good idea. Maybe there's another way to look at it. I can't believe you're defending him. I'm not defending him. Well, yes, you are. You're taking his side. Wait. Wait a second. Who's talking about sides here? We are. We're talking about sides, you and me. You're sticking up for him. You always do that. I don't always do anything, Beth. I haven't been around here long enough to always do anything. I'm going to take a walk. Wait, mom. Mom. Great. This sucks. I'm out of here. Wait, Chris. Wait, Chris! I want to ask you something. Have you looked for work this week? Yes. Has any been offered to you? Nope. O.k. Sign here, please. [Arf arf arf] O.k., I got it. We're splitting everything, right? O.k. This isn't bad. I could go about 40. I could do that for you. This one has four heads. Oh. Thank you for telling me. It's worth more. I don't see a remote. Did you guys forget the remote? I don't know. No remote. If you had a remote, I could go 60, maybe 70. The way we're looking at things now, we're talking 25, tops, 'cause... You know, picture it... You're on the couch, you got your drink, your food, your girl, you're watching a nice pornie, now you want to fast-forward the talking parts. Are you going to go to the set each time? Nobody's going to do that. Would you do that? No. I'd use the remote. 60. 70. Anything else? Yeah. I need some lottery tickets. How many you need there? 70. Hey. I thank you, my father thanks you, and god bless you. [Chirping] [Whistles] These are good. They look sharp. Did you check the rise? The rise is fine. Better check. I said it's fine. We're fine. Good. Let's try these. [Whistling] [Chirping] ♪ ♪ ♪ whoa! [Telephone rings] [Shouting] [Ring] [Ring] Give me a hug. Squeeze me. Squeeze me. Arg! Ha ha! Faking to the left. Going up for a jump shot and... oh! 7, oh, 6. 8. She's going back for... One more shot. Shot put! Out the window. Here we go. Here we... Take the whole goddamn tray. How about that? [Growling] Weird. This is so weird. Why would mom buy a bird? I don't know. Its name's Mary Louise. How long has she been resting? Four days. This is so weird. Mom? Ma? Mom? Matty? Mom, it's family night. What time is it? It's almost 5:00. Are you still tired? You can sleep if you want to. Let's do this tomorrow, o.K., Matty, huh? O.k. I don't feel good right now. O.k. Matty? Matty, do you want me to fix you something? Did you eat anything? I'm all right. Let me fix you... I'll fix you something. Do you want some milk? Sure. No milk. How about some juice? Fine. No juice. How about some water? O.k. Do you want anything else? No. This is great. Thanks. Let me know if you want something else. God is great, god is good. God, we thank you for our food. Amen. Hey, Chris. Um, did I borrow this album from you? No, I don't think so. It's not yours, huh? It's so weird. Chris, is everything... Is everything all right? Yeah, it's fine. Is there somewhere we could talk? Yeah. Yeah. Let's, uh... Let's go outside. Are you and my mom still friends? I think so. I mean, you don't come around too much anymore. Yeah, that's true, but I like to think we're... That I'm her friend. You definitely can. She's a good friend to have, too. She's loyal. She's got a great personality. Everybody likes her, everybody that knows her. She's a terrific person, your mom. She is. She really is. So why don't you come by anymore? There must be some good reason. Well, it's kind of hard to explain, Chris. Look, I know I haven't been very nice to you some of the time. It's not that I don't like you. It's just that sometimes it takes me longer to get used to new people. Once you get to know me, I can be real friendly. This has nothing to do with you. You were fine. I wasn't fine! I know that! I apologize. Give me another chance. You and I can be friends. I'll go to interesting music concerts with you. I'll mow your lawn if you ever grow one. Because my mom really liked having you as a friend. She doesn't know anyone here. She's starting to get sad again. When she had you as a friend, she had someone to talk to. I know I was a real pain in the ass. I promise I won't be. You probably don't believe me. Give me another chance. I can't stand to see my mom so lonely.

Well... Let's go. [Playing looney tunes theme] Thank you very much for coming out this evening. We appreciate your patronage. Please drive safely going home. Aah! Aah! Aah! Aah! Aah! Grrr! Beth. Beth. Beth, can you hear me? Do you know who I am? Yes! Will you go away? Did we take anything? Uh-huh. Did we put anything in our mouth? Yes. What? A Beth-cake. What's that? Never mind. Could I have some privacy, please? Hon, why don't you head back to my apartment? Give us girls a little privacy. Why are we so groggy? Can we sit up? Will you please leave? Why are we so groggy? Well, because we've been in bed for five days, you nitwit! Get out of my bedroom. Are you sick? Yes. What's wrong? I'm sick. You are? Yes. Well, let's get you better. [Vacuuming] Beth, I've made some fresh coffee, and I'd like you to join me. Would you please go away? Beth, I've made some coffee, and I'd like you to join me right now. God! Get your damn hands off of me! Aah! Are you crazy or what? What is the matter with you? Get your damn hands off me! Are you crazy? Let go of me! Aah! Let go of me! Aah! No! Aah! O.k., that's it! When you're clean and quiet, we'll talk. Aah! Thank you. You're welcome. I'm much better now. Good. You can go. We're not finished yet. We're not? No. I'm much better now. [Sigh] We're going to need some warm clothes. We are? I'm fine, really. Tell me what you'd like to wear. Settle down, everybody. Settle down. Before we begin, I have an announcement to make. You may be wondering why Winston was absent today. Well, he's not sick after all. We were informed that Winston was one of the big winners in this week's lottery... Wow! Cool! And will become eligible for the big spin. Isn't that great? O.k., that's enough. Let's settle down. Now, take your books out so we can begin the lesson we started yesterday. Matthew, just a minute. Matthew! Everyone, stay seated. Winston, Matt's here. There's some delis in the dining room. Help yourself. Don't be shy. Hi, Matt. Why didn't you tell me? Tell you what? That we won. What do you mean? We split everything, remember? Come on, that is not what you said. You said split the tickets. No. That's not true. O.k., ask Dale if you don't believe me. She was there. I got to go. I want my share. It's not your share. I want my share. I want my share. It's not your share. Hi, Matt. Is there something wrong here? The ticket was both of ours. We split the tickets. Matt got half, and I got half. The winner was in my half. Ask Dale. You're such a liar. Dale, could you come in here for a minute, sweetheart? Matt says the winning ticket was his also. Is this true? They were supposed to split the tickets, and then Winston had the winner. No. That's not true. This is for my mom. She needs it. Matt, try and be fair here. If I don't get this, she might die. She really might. Did you look at your tickets? You might have a winner, too. We stole things... Hey, Winston! Come here, you little millionaire. Come on. Come on. Don't do anything fancy for me. Sorry, Matt. Everyone says that Winston had the winner. Do you want to stick around for a while, have a bite to eat, or do you want to head on home? I was thinking about you the other day. I was thinking, what if someday I got married... And I do want to... And had this husband that I really loved, and he died? I'd be so sad that I'd be... I'd be tired. I saw a picture of him. He was very handsome. Chris doesn't say much about him, but he did tell me about this trip you all took to yellowstone and how you had a broken toe because Matt dropped a cooler on your foot, and John carried you for 2 miles. You were very lucky to have someone who loved you so much. No one would ever carry me 2 miles. Oh, I'm sure they would. No. I'm a size 12 already. I don't think so. Where are we going, Jody? Do you know? Further. A little further. Oh, no. Oh, no, no, no. I did this with another friend once. My friend was very depressed, suicidal, even, and I thought of this. What happened to your friend? Oh, she's institutionalized now. But I still like the idea, don't you? Mom, did Matt get back yet? Isn't he with you? He was supposed to meet me after school, and he never showed up. He's probably at the Buckley's. I called up there. He left two hours ago. He started out riding off down that way. Don't put me on hold. Is that Matty? Did he call? I'm calling about my brother Matthew macauley. He's 9 years old. He's got brown hair. I don't know what to do. I called the police. I called the hospitals. He's wearing a yellow sweatshirt and blue jeans. Look, he's not at his friend's house. We know what his habits are, and we're not going to wait 24 hours. Now, damn it. I'm a citizen. I'm a professional musician, and I want some action. Mrs. Macauley? Mrs. Macauley, I'm officer Rogers. This is officer rotiz. We're checking up on Matthew. Have you heard anything? No. Anything from the neighbors? Nothing. [Ring] Yes? Yes. Bless you. Thank you. He's in bingham. He went to bingham. He went home. I'll wait here. Hi, Matty. [Doorbell buzzes] It's a great doorbell, Matt. It still works. Oh, Matty. Matty, do you miss this place? No. I miss you. Oh, Matty. Are you mad at me? Are you? Matt, listen... I want you to talk to me. I love you so much. I care about you more than anything else in the world. You must know that, and you must know you can always talk to me. I can't. Why? I don't want to say bad things. You don't always have to be such a good boy. I do. Why? Because you like me that way. Oh, Matty, I love you any way. I need you, but sometimes, you know, you have to tell me what you need and what you want. I want... What, honey? I want to see him again... Just one more time. Does he know about me? Does he know I'm in the fourth grade? Yes, I think he does. Does he know I do bad things? What bad things? Stealing. Well, he knows we'll make things right. Do you think he still loves me? Yes, Matt, yes. Will the hurt stop? You know what I read once? That heartbreak is life educating us. You understand what that means? That we're learning something from this? That's right. Raspberry genoise. It's incredible. White German chocolate cake. It's incredible. Hazelnut praline, your favorite. You'll love them. Let me in. Come on. You know, it's funny. Before, I used to watch you work, and I'd think, here you are, taking care of yourself, prospering, even. But most of all... Surviving, which I certainly do respect you for. I really do. And I've seen how you use your aggression and hostility and inconsiderate self-centeredness to great advantage, you know? I mean, I've learned something from you, Lisa. I really have. That you should be more hostile, self-centered, and what was the other one? No, no, no, no, no. No. You see, I don't have to be. You know why? Because I got you. I can stay the way I am. It's a great... It's a great partnership, Lisa. It really is. Yeah, I'm very excited about it. It's a great opportunity, and i... ahem... I'm determined to make it work. I really am. Beth. There are a couple of other... Beth. What? It's been almost four years since my marriage fell apart. You know how hard it was for you to have been left with two boys? It was harder to have been left alone. I'm going to charge a fortune for these babies. Hi. Hi. You're Nina? Yes. We never met. I'm Beth. Yes. Hello. I brought this basket of food. Could I just leave it with you? Food? I... Charles! Charles, I didn't want to interrupt anything, really. I just came by because I wanted to say thank you. You know, when I got pretty crazy there, I think maybe I scared you a little bit. Didn't I, just a little bit? Yeah. I know, and I apologize. You know, you were... You were real generous to me. I don't why you did it, but you did it, and, uh... And I want to thank you for it. So, that's it. Thank you. You know, I wouldn't ascribe such pure motives to me. No? I lied about the bowling. So you guys are back together, huh? No. Joey's here. She's picking him up. Hey, man. Bye. Bye. Well, they sure do love their daddies, don't they? [Matt] What I remember most is family night. Mom got pretty strict about this idea, so we had a lot of family nights. There is no way i'm wearing this thing. Uh-uh. I remember Chris stopped wearing Jody's shirts, but then he started cutting his own shirts in half. Matt wants to go for a ride. Family night. You know the deal. O.k. Do you want to go with us? Sometimes friends would join us for family night. Sometimes we'd just be by ourselves. All right, cool. Later, creator. I remember once we went on some boats, and I got to drive one by myself. That was good. Most of all, I just remember being together, 'cause then... I was saved. Captioning performed by the national captioning institute, inc.
