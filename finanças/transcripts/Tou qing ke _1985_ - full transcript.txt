(hits thudding) - Hey are you all right? - Please, keep this necklace for me. It is very important to me, please. (gasps) I'll come back and get it after the war. - Don't worry, I'll keep it for you, my name is Loba. - Thank you very much, go on! (dramatic music) (tense music) (bushes rustling) (sword whistling) (explosions booming) (sword whistling) (explosions booming) (sword whistling) (weapons clanging) - Ya!

(cheering) - Drink up, Chang, ha ha, ha ha ha, yeah! (revelers chattering) (revelers laughing) Congratulations Wang Lee, yes, have a drink! (laughing) - I think he knows that the ultimate goal in life, (mumbles), you got to achieve, is to enjoy yourself! - You're right, you're quite right there! We've all got to try-- - Drink up! - And enjoy yourselves! (chattering) - Drink up! (cheering) - Come on! (cheering) (chattering) (laughing) - Wang Lee! (laughing) (chattering) - Hey! - Hey! Hey, Wang Lee, write your name on my butt, will you? Come on! - What, down there? - Yeah, come on, Wang Lee! - Should I sign my name, eh? - Come on! - Why don't you put your fingerprints on it? - (shushing) No! I draw a picture instead, heh heh. (laughing) - [Girl] Wang Lee! (laughing) (chattering) - Look how happy our champion is. - Of course. He'll never lose now, not with me as his manager. - See I won-- - Hey, the boss is here. Come and bring some drinks! Give me that. Mrs. Lo, Boss. - Thanks. A toast, to the iron lady of the boxing ring! (friend laughing) - Hey! - Congratulations. - Thank you. - Hey Boss, a champion, and a beauty, a champion and a beauty, a great match, don't you think, huh, huh? Sorry, hmm. - Wang Lee, the new champion. - Cheers! - My new club will be open very soon, and I want to put you in charge of it, because I think with you around, there'll be no trouble. - Well, thank you very much, Boss. I'll do my very best. - Good. - And that's right, you know, we'll follow the champion wherever he goes. - Hey, you should sign her on! (laughing) - Uh, telephone, Boss! - Mrs. Lo, when will you organize a woman's match and let us-- (laughing) - Yes! - That would be wonderful! I guarantee you'll make a lot of money on that! Why not bring mud wrestling, (laughs), yeah! (laughing) - Hey, cut it out, will ya? - You can't-- - Get out of my way! - Okay! - Let him in! - Go on! - Come on! - Get out of-- - Look, you! (laughter) - Wang Lee, two foreigners are here and they're making trouble, you better take a look. - Oh? - Over there. (revelers murmuring) - All right. (shouting) Hey now what do you want? - Where is the boss? - I'm sorry, we're closed! - We want to see your boss, dipshit! - Now look, you two, I told you already, we're closed! - You-- - Uh, whatever these gentlemen want, I'll handle 'em, guys. I'm sorry, David Lo has just left the place, but can I help you out at all? - Well, we want to see David Lo! It's important, I want to see him now! - Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, you, get out! (grunting) - And as for you, you little yellow shithead, I'm not gonna take any more-- - You son of a bitch! (hits thudding) - Stop that! - Boss, Boss! - What's going on here? - They're here causing trouble! - Oh Anthony, my friend! David, I'm sorry. Why didn't somebody tell me they're here? They're my friends! Please come along with me, please. (tense music) - Hmph. (knocking) - Come in! - Right, good news, Boss, everything's okay. All the concerned parties have been fixed, we're clear now. The new club in Wenchang can open for business any time. Also remember that bitch, her contract? I fixed her, there's no more problems! - Never mind that now. Here, take a look at this? - Huh? Hey Boss, you're good. You're clever to have thought of this. These games will be legalized soon, it's a brilliant idea! - Aagh! - Good! - That's not what I meant! You see the necklace that that blonde's wearing? I don't care what it costs or how you do it, you get it for me! - So, it's that important huh? Right, I'll handle it. - It's very important! If you can get it back, I won't have any worries. Otherwise, I could be finished. - (chuckles) Relax, Boss, you just leave it up to me! I got a Korean friend, Kol Pak, he's a versatile man! - Right, I'll leave it to you, but get me results! - (laughs) Don't worry, Boss! You can have anything in the world if you got money. I'll ask Pak to find us the men we need for the job. (tense music) - You bastard. You want to challenge me, you must be tired of life. - They're gonna fight. (hits thudding) (grunting) - Hi! (fist thudding) (groaning) Ha! - Ow! (fist thudding) (heads thumping) (fist thudding) (groaning) (moaning) (groaning) (fist thudding) (groaning) - Ya! (fist thudding) Ya! (fist thudding) (grunting) (hits thudding) (grunting) (hits thudding) (grunting) (hits thudding) - You can beat him. (grunting) (hits thudding) (groaning) (hits thudding) (grunting) (dramatic music) - Ya! (hit thudding) (screaming) (groaning) (thumping) (groaning) - Hey kid, the boxing game is very dangerous. Doesn't pay much, why don't you quit it? - Well I like it, I've always wanted to be in the ring. It's the only thing I can do. - But you know kid, you're a very fine boxer. You should be making a lot more than this. There are plenty of opportunities in this world to make yourself a fortune. - I know, but I've no choice. I have no other qualifications. - I know a man who's asked me to find people like you to go and work for him. - People like me? - When the job's done, you'll get a large sum of money. It'll be more than enough to keep you for the rest of your life! - Really, that sounds like it's very good! - But you must do everything I tell you to. This job involves a necklace. The boss wants to get it back, you see. You must be successful, no matter what. I'm sure you can hack it. (energetic music) (grunting) (hits thudding) (energetic music) - Here you must be tired, take a break now, come on. - Oh all right. - Huh? (sensual music) (clattering) - Brother, I've brought you some drinks here! I knew you'd be practicing! - Hey, don't you have to work today? - Brother, practice to me is much more important. Here, have one of these. Lisa, you want one of them? - No, thanks. You carry on. - Hey now, Lisa! - [Lisa] I'll call you later. - Okay, I'll see ya! Ha Soi, you got work to do! You shouldn't waste your time here! - I want to learn boxing. - You should work hard now, and save some money to buy your own boat! It's no use working for others, because if you do that, you're never gonna get on in this world! - I saved a few grand now, but it's not for the boat. I want to use it to fly around southeast Asia, to see you fight. (laughs) I want to be your cheerleader! - You think I'll win? - Hey you're in excellent condition, better than Ali, even Rocky can't compare to you! Here, try this! - Heh, hmm. You really do care about me, heh heh! Here's looking at ya, huh? (romantic music) (water splashing) (romantic music) (moaning) (groaning) - It's late, why don't you sleep? - I'm not tired, I can't sleep. - I'm very tired. Read a book, or watch TV or something like that. - What's wrong with you? You're always tired these days! - Come on, just let me sleep, will ya? (thumping) - Umph! You're a really selfish old bastard! I'm sick of this! (water splashing) (grunting) (gasping) Just finished training? - (laughs) Yes, heh heh. What brings you here? (tense music) (romantic music) - I'm sorry. (splashing water) (sultry nightclub music) - Jimmy, you look like you could use some company. - Uh, no thank you, I'm not used to this. This is the first time I've been to a bar room. - Hi darling, you're here now. - Ah sweetheart! (girl giggling) Sit down, sit down, come on. - Excuse me, I'm gonna go out for a walk. - Hey, where are you going so-- - [Jimmy] That's okay I'll be right back. - Uh Jimmy! (sultry nightclub music) (grunting) (fists thudding) (grunting) (hits thudding) - Hiya! (foot thudding) (crunching) - Ah! (groans) - Goddamn it! You said that guy Pak could do anything! Now look what's happened! If we don't fix this soon, you and I are both in trouble! - Boss, take it easy! - How can I take it easy when the guy's dead? And that Korean kid still doesn't know I'm his boss! - Well, we'll think of something! - We must do something now, time's running out! I want that necklace by next month at the latest! - That necklace is really important? - (sighs) It's very complicated! The Korean gang split the necklace in two. One part went to the Bald-Headed Gang, and the other to the Redhead. He's got many hitmen, guys like this, right? This is him here, I think he's behind it all. - We don't have much time left. Why don't we just send a hitman to take care of him? - That's easy to say, but who can I send? - Wang Lee, he's the best! - You think he'd do it? - Heh heh, money can buy most things. If it really pays, he'll do it! (somber music) (train chuffing) - I was brought up with my brother. I was real close to him and now he's been murdered. I must find the murderer. - Do you know who killed him? - No, but I'll take you to see a man. He's my brother's boss. He'll pay you good money to kill the murderer. Are you willing to do it? - (sighs) I never kill for money. I just can't bring myself to do it. - Jimmy, do you know how much I love you? - What, me? - Yeah, we've only known each other for a short time, yet I find that you're the only man I can depend on. I don't think I can live without you. - Linda. (romantic music) - Jimmy! - Hi Linda! - Come in! (tense music) - Not bad, you look smart. - You wanted to see me? - Let me introduce myself, I was Pak's boss. You can work for me like he did, if you want to. - How, you want me to kill for you, huh, hmm? - Heh, if you want to avenge Pak, you'll do exactly as I say. Go to the King's Pool tomorrow, and take the necklace back from the Bald-Headed Gang. They're the ones that killed Pak. (balls cracking) (suspenseful music) (hits thudding) (grunting) (ball clattering) (grunting) (hits thudding) (stick whooshing) (grunting) (thumping) (grunting) (hits thudding) (grunting) (crunching) (grunting) (hits thudding) (grunting) (audience shouting) (wrestlers grunting) (hits thudding) (grunting) - [Jimmy] Another five bucks! (girls squealing) Ya! (hits thudding) (grunting) (guests chattering) (hits thudding) (impact echoing) (tense music) - Hey, how are you doing? - Hello! (relaxing music) - Wang Lee? - What is it? What do you want? - You're really going to southeast Asia? - Yeah, that's right. It's always been my ambition to take part in that tournament. - You're doing pretty well. And the pay is very good, you don't need to work so hard. But if you have financial problems, then I can help you. - That's very kind of you, but I don't need your money. (guests chattering) - Master! - Hmm? - There's some foreign men to see you. - Excuse me. Oh, Anthony, hello, how are you? Look, I've got a party going inside there. Could we talk later? - No, I want to talk to you right now! You may not have the time, but for sure I do! Get in the car! - Hey, what is this? - Come on, get in! - Hey! - Come on! - Help, help, help! - Huh? - Help! - Hey there, you two! Go and get Wang Lee, the boss is calling, go! - Hey! - Come on! Shut up, get moving! - Take it easy! (motor revving) (suspenseful music) - Mr. Lo, my boss said your time is up! When you gonna give us that necklace? Let me tell you! Rome's been calling me every day about this! How long do you want us to wait! - Yeah, how long? - We're not gonna take any more of this! We're taking care of you! (engine roaring) (tires squealing) Get out of the car, come on! Come on! - Come on! - Get moving! (Lo grunting) - Move it, come on, get over there! (shouting) Come on, move it! (grunting) - Ah! What do you want from me? - Mr. Lo, listen to me. You know you can't get away that easily. You know what the Chinese proverb says. "The son must always carry his father's old debts." - I won't lie to you, I stake it on my reputation! There's no use you forcing me, I know nothing about it! - And we don't give a damn, just give us the necklace! - I really have nothing to do with it! My father had the necklace, don't you understand? - If you got any brains, you'll hand the necklace over to us. So have you got that now, do you understand that? Otherwise we'll shoot ya! - It won't help you, you can kill me-- (fist thumping) (grunting) - Come on! (tires squealing) - Ah! (hits thudding) (grunting) Ha! (thudding) (grunting) (board thudding) Ha! (board whooshing) (hits thudding) (grunting) (weapons clattering) (grunting) (hits thudding) (grunting) - Come on, come on! (grunting) (hits thudding) (weapons clattering) - Okay, okay! (hits thudding) No, no no no, no! Hey, guys, come on! Come on! - Hey Boss, are you okay then? - (groans) You came in time! - Hey Lo, you gonna listen! We're not gonna give this up so easily! We'll give you just one more month, or you're gonna end up face-down in the ocean, you understand? Get lost! (motor revving) - [Wang] Boss, why don't you just leave everything to me? You really mustn't worry. - Master, your tea. - Thanks, you can go. All right, I'll explain it. The ninja appeared in Hong Kong during the second World War. A foreigner was very badly hurt, so he gave the necklace to my father for safekeeping, 'til after the war. Later on my father was found by the ninja and they stole the necklace from him. At that time, I got some information. I was told that it was carved with a code number, which I believe was a Swiss bank account. The mafia came after me. They were a bunch of rude Italians, and they demanded the two necklaces from me. But I didn't have them. My father had lost his, and the Korean guy had the other one, of course. - It's really complicated. - So you see, I want you to get the necklace back from Korea, and those bastards, I want you to kill 'em all. - You want me to kill? I'm sorry, heh heh, I don't need that. - How much can you make boxing? Just enough to make a living. Do this and you'll make a thousand times more than that! - I make enough to keep me going. Murder's against the law. I'm sorry, find someone else. (somber music) - That's all you ever do, isn't it, train all the time. When's it gonna stop, hm? - Look, you know I gotta take part in this special tournament! After I've won, then I'll open a gym, and then, then we can get married. - (sighs) Are you so sure you're gonna win? As people say, some mountains are too high. - (sigha) I have confidence, I'm ready for it! Don't you worry, I'm gonna win. - This is the last fight, hmm? - Hmm, okay, I promise you. - Okay. (romantic music) No... - Come on, we're getting married soon anyway! - Then let's wait 'til we're married, okay? (sighs) (dramatic music) (hits thudding) (grunting) - Oh, ah! (spring reverberating) - Ha Soi! (moaning) Hey, hey, did I hurt you, are you okay? - I'm okay, don't worry! I, I'm used to this sort of thing! Come on! - Come on, let's do it. Here, there. Okay? (hits thudding) (grunting) - Brother! (grunting) What's she doing here? - Huh, oh! - You better take a break. You've been working too hard. - Hi, Lisa! - You women don't know nothing! A fighter must practice, he can't stop in the middle. - Excuse me. (thumping) You don't talk like that! You cut it out now, will ya? You can't talk to her like that 'cause she's my manageress. - Wow! Well, you must be very capable! Can you arrange a match for me, huh? (chuckling) - He's just talking, you never mind him. - So tell me young man, can you box too? - Uh... (thumping) - No, he can't. - Well, sure I can! I'm brother Lee's student, and he's a champion! I can't be that bad, heh, am I right? - Take no notice, he means well, but he's just a kid. Hey Ha Soi, now you take yourself off jogging. (romantic music) - I found you a flat yesterday. It would make a great gym for you. (breathing heavily) (moaning) (sighing) (grunting) (sighing) - Oh god! (moaning) - Oh my god! (breathing heavily) (birds chirping) The boss wants to see you tomorrow. - I won't go, I don't want to see him for the time being. - Jimmy, what are you planning to do? - You'll find out very soon. - He suspects you, you must be really careful. - He does? - Don't hide it from me. I know you've got the necklace, and you've gone and hidden it. - Linda, you know I'm doing this for the two of us. - For the two of us. - Remember I told you I wanted to get married. That'll cost a lot of money, I don't have it! (hits thudding) (grunting) - [Linda] Whoo! (grunting) (hits thudding) (comical music) (grunting) (thudding) (grunting) (head thudding) - [Linda] Oh! (water splashing) - More goons. Linda, you stay here while I go take care of them, okay. (sighing) (grunting) (hits thudding) (water splashing) I think it must be Redhead that sent you. Now you go back and tell him not to try again! Let's go! (relaxing music) - Jimmy, I'm scared! Redhead won't let us get away so easily. - Don't be scared, I'm with you. - I'm relying on you. - Let's enjoy ourselves tonight. (sensual music) (sighing) (moaning) (grunting) (gasping) (crying in ecstasy) (moaning) - Ah! - Linda! - Here, let me help you. (sighing) - No, I'm too sensitive. (sighing) Oh Linda, now stop that I have to go! Ah Linda, stop! - Come on! (sighing) - I've got to go! (sighing) Now Linda! Hey! Hey! (hit thudding) Hello, how are you? - I'm fine, you smartass! (grunting) (hits thudding) Yeah, man. - My goodness, you're not bad at all! So tell me, who was it sent you here? - It's Redhead, he's the one who wants you dead, man! - I don't care what color he is. What I want is for you to try this punch! (hits thudding) (grunting) - Now show me what else you can do. - Hey listen buddy, you haven't seen anything yet! Now you're gonna see something! (grunting ) (hits thudding) Ya! (hits thudding) (grunting) Ya! (hits thudding) (grunting) (screaming) - Good news, Boss! That Redhead tried to use a girl to trap Jimmy! But it turns out that the girl has really fallen in love with Jimmy! And both of them have betrayed Redhead! He's got some real problems! - What's so good about that? If Jimmy's got the necklace, we're finished! - What about Wang Lee? - That bastard, he wouldn't do it. - Really? - You said you could handle this, and we don't have much time! What do we do now? - I know that you and Linda are trying to betray me. - You can have the necklace, but on one condition. - You want to bargain? I think you're over-estimating yourself. - 200,000, in US dollars. - 200,000? - Linda and I are gonna get married. You see, I need the money. (laughing) - You must know, that Linda is my woman. She's marrying no one. You want 200,000 US? Maybe I'll think about that. (clicking) That bastard just left my office, get rid of him right now. (tense music) (dramatic music) (suspenseful music) (grunting) (hits thudding) (glass shattering) (grunting) (hits thudding) (glass shattering) (grunting) (hits thudding) (glass shattering) (grunting) (hits thudding) (door slamming) (motor revving) (screaming) (shouting) (hits thudding) (tires squealing) (fist thudding) (tires squealing) (screaming) (crashing) (relaxing music) - Lisa? - Mm hm? - I'll put some oil on for you. - Mm, thanks. (suspenseful music) (relaxing music) Do you have any idea when you can first feel a baby's heartbeat? - I don't know, I've never had a baby. (sighing) - I went to the doctor yesterday. He says that I'm pregnant. - What? What did you say, you're kidding me! - I wouldn't joke about this. - Oh, what do we do, then? - Well, you certainly can't leave me now. (tense music) (clicking) - Huh? (chuckling) - What are you doing on my boat? - We followed you, for many days. - Give me the camera! - No way! Look! - Give it to me! - Behind you! (dramatic music) (hits thudding) (grunting) (water splashing) (hits thudding) - This is nonsense, stop this, ya bastards! (whistling) Uh, hold it! - Don't do anything stupid! - Heh heh, you never thought of this (laughs). - Don't move! - Go ahead, shoot! - Tie 'em up and take 'em to the Boss. - Go on, go on! (shouting) (water splashing) - Go on, shoot him! (spears whooshing) (water splashing) (motor revving) - Ha Soi, Ha Soi! - Brother, I'm coming, wait up! (water splashing) - Don't let him get away! (motor revving) - Here! Brother, catch this! (splashing) (motor revving) (dramatic music) (panting) - They're coming! - Let's go! (motor revving) - Hurry up you guys, after them! - You got it! (motor revving) - Faster! - [Jimmy] Faster! - Hurry up, we're right behind them now! - Can't, there's too many in the boat! - Forget it, we've got no chance. - Lisa, don't go! - You know everything now, we've got nothing left to say! Anyway we're not married, so it's goodbye! - Lisa, I didn't blame you, why are you so nasty? - I don't love you anymore, all right, just get it! - Lisa! (sad music) Johnny, Lisa's gone, I couldn't hold her. - Well Boss, you let her go then. She's found another man now. She's no use, let her go, don't get upset. She's just a woman. - You're right. (slamming) - Um, ah... - Jenny! - Where have you been, I was worried about you! - Jenny, I've got to go to Thailand, and I want you to come with me. - You want me to go with you? - Uh huh. - Uh hm? Are you leaving right now? But why, why are you going to Thailand? Come on, tell me! - Don't ask questions. If you want to come, you meet me at the airport tomorrow. - Oh. (door clicking) (dramatic music) Who is this woman? - Uh she, she uh, uh... - I'll tell you the truth, I'm having his baby now. Wang Lee, I've broken up with David Lo. Let's go to the States together. - Well, is that true? - You, uh, you mustn't believe what she says! And that's not true at all! - You've got to tell the truth! - Lisa, I've made up my mind! We can't go on like this! I'm leaving with Jenny. - Wang Lee no! Oh! (gasping) Stay there! (dramatic music) I've given up everything for you! - Lisa, don't be stupid! - You were a nobody before you met me! It was me who made you a champion. You'd still be a bum if it wasn't for me! - Now take it easy, put that gun down! - You ungrateful shit, we'll settle this today! - Lisa, come on, take it easy, we can talk! - Oh! Oh, get off me! - Give me the gun! (grunting) Lisa! - I want to kill you! - Lisa, will you let go of the gun! - You bastard! - You got to behave yourself, woman! (Lisa whimpering) Look, stop being so damn stupid! - Get off! (whimpering) - Let go, let go! Let go, I say, will ya, let go! - No! (crying) (gun firing) (dramatic music) (poignant music) - Wang Lee! - Huh, huh! - So now you're a murderer! - And we're all witnesses to the crime! You'll end up in jail! Right, you've got no choice! There's only one thing you can do, go to Korea, right now! I'll fix this. (motor revving) These are the Koreans that have the necklace. When your job is done, come back to Hong Kong and get married. - [Ha Soi] Brother! - You better get going. - Right! Jenny! - Brother! - Wang Lee, don't forget to write to us! And look after yourself in Korea. - Yeah, I will, now don't you go worrying, huh? - Mm-mm. - Brother, I hear that those Korean girls are really pretty. Don't make a mess of yourself! - You! Don't you talk rubbish! My fiancee doesn't like that! - Don't worry, I'll take good care of her (laughs)! - Ha Soi, I rely upon you, to take good care of Jenny. And I've already rented that place to start our own gymnasium. - You must come back soon for the opening ceremony. - Yeah brother, don't forget that you said you'd make me assistant manager, right? Hey brother, it's time to go. - Uh huh, yeah, it is. - You're right. - Come on. - Come on. (aircraft engine roaring) (relaxing music) - Hello! The Italian boss, he sends you his congratulations. You've finally got Wang Lee on the plane. So the first step of your plan has succeeded. - I've never failed in anything that I promised. I'm much smarter than I look, you see. - You're not only smart, you're a genius. - Really? (chuckling) - Mmm. Not now, back to business. - (laughs) Sure. - This check is the first payment. You'll get the rest when the job's completed. - Let's have dinner together, okay? - Mm hmm. (aggressive music) - Sir! - Who are you? - My boss is expecting you. Would you please come this way? (laughing) - I've been looking for you for some time. Glad you could make it, let's have a talk. Mister, you're good, sit down. - Please. - Please. Do you know just who your boss really is? He's David Lo, my boss too. You're being used, and I've come to help you. (suspenseful music) Do you know, you're in a bad situation. You've taken that necklace from the Bald gang, and Redhead won't leave it there. He'll send his men to kill you! - I want money for the necklace, 200,000 US. - Is it worth that much? You must be reasonable. If it's 20,000, well, maybe. I could fix you up. - What if I don't accept? - Well, if you won't give us that necklace, I'm afraid I'll kill ya! (hits thudding) (grunting) (weapons whistling) (thudding) (grunting) (weapons whistling) (grunting) - [Messenger] Hold it, hold it! (tense music) - Please go in. - My friend, long time no see. - I have some business to discuss with you. - Is that so? (grunting) (dramatic music) I hear that you're now working for Redhead. - He sent me here to talk with you. - Oh yeah? - The thing is this. A killer has come here from Hong Kong. He's after my boss's neck. - [Ninja Master] Really? - I hear his kung fu is very good. - [Ninja Master] What's his name? - You don't need to know because we'll get him together. - This sounds very interesting.

Now he's risking his neck in Korea, we can reap the benefits. - You really think so? It's the Italians and David Lo who'll get the benefit. We're only the pawns in this game. - You're really the only thing that I need. - I want a big house, and a limousine. Can you afford that? - You see with my brains, we can afford to buy you a Rolls-Royce. - A Rolls-Royce, you mean that, huh? You wouldn't lie to me? - Of course I mean it. I'll get you anything that you'll ever need. - Aw. (romantic music) (tense music) (gun firing) (grunting) (gun firing) (groaning) (tense music) (moaning) (tense music) - You've done a good job.

A, two, hyphen, one four, one two three, five six nine. I'll repeat it back to you, just to make sure. A two, one four, one two three, five six nine. That correct? You've done a marvelous job, thank you very much. You better get yourself back here soon, your girlfriend's waiting, bye bye! Hey okay, gentlemen!

(gun firing) (gunshot echoing) (laughing) - Good job. - Well done, you're very clever, Johnny. With your brains, you don't need that stupid man anyway, you agree? - Heh heh, that's right, you are a much better businessman. (laughing) - I thank all of you for all your assistance. - When we arrive in Switzerland, we'll draw the money out of the bank immediately. $5 million will be put into your account. - [Gangster] And if you come to Italy, you must look us up. (laughing) - That's right! - Right! - Thank you very much, I will.

(tense music) - Hey wait a minute! - Wait! - There must be some mistake! He didn't do anything, no! - Wait! - Come on, get him out of here! - Come on! - Stop, oh don't! (dramatic music)
