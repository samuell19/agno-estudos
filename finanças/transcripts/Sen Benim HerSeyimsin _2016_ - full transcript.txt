Directed by Eugenio Derbez, adapted from "Instructions Not Included" by Guillermo Rios, Leticia Lopez Margalli and Eugenio Derbez. Let me tell you about my father. His name is Cesur Çıralı. He was different from all others. According to him, life was made of coincidences and fear. He used to say, embrace coincidences and conquer fear. He was afraid of nothing. No one. He wanted me to be fearless. "Fear is like a wild animal." What animal, Dad? -Like a wolf. -Why a wolf? Because... if the wolf senses you're scared, he attacks, but if you... ...look him in the eye without being scared, if you don't step back, -you can tame him. -OK. Then he will be the one running away. To conquer your fear, you need to feed your courage. You need to make your heart roar. Like this. Roar. Roar. -Roar. -What? Just like that. Roar! Roar! There were two kinds of fear. Little ones. Big ones. We started with the small ones. Please, roar. Roar. Roar. -Roar. -Don't be scared, son. -Please, roar. -You're a lion! Nothing to be scared of. Conquer that fear. Roar. Please, Dad. Please, roar. Don't be scared. Roar. Roar. Like I said, he was different. -What's this, Dad? -An ancient tomb. Dad. Don't be scared. Roar. Roar. Roar. My dad wasn't preparing me only for the dangers and fear of this world. He was preparing me for the ones that he didn't know. The fear of the other worlds. OK, Dad. I conquered it. I am brave. Let me out. A little more, son. Beat that fear. Wolf. -Wolf. -What wolf, son? -Calm down. Come. -Wolf. There are no wolves here, son. What wolf? OK, calm down. -There are no wolves. Come. -I saw a wolf. Calm down. There are no wolves here. OK? I just saw a wolf. -There are no wolves here. -Let me go! I saw it. I think, if it was today, they would have hospitalized him or arrested him. Dad. This is too high. I can't jump. He worked a lot on my fears. -What are you doing, Daddy? -For your own good, my lion. -What are you doing? -Just do it once. -Just let it go! -You won't be scared anymore. -For God's sake. -Come on, for your own sake. -Let go. -Roar! Dad! But he failed. Cancer conquered my dad before I conquered my fears. There was no one else to push me. And I could never jump by myself. I couldn't. I couldn't embrace the coincidences. I couldn't conquer my fears. Neither small ones, nor middle ones. And certainly not the big ones. I don't get it. Don't you love me? Of course I do. And my biggest fear was... My love. I'm going to make you so happy. Everything is going to be beautiful. ...the mother of all fears. Dearest husband. Marriage. Dearest husband. -Do you love me, Sedat? -A lot. -Why? -Because you're special. You're different. You're special. So special. So different. So special. So very special. Unique. I love you. Je t'aime. Ich liebe dich. Te amo. Watashi wa, anata o aishiteimasu. Do you love me? I adore you. You're the love of my life. 20 MONTHS LATER Sedat. -Yes? -You don't recognize me? Not really. You were madly in love with me. I was the love of your life. -How? -Pınar. -Pınar. -I'm Pınar. Pınar. Pınar. Pınar. Oh, Pınar. Yes. Because you adored me. I was special. Unique. -Yes. Your son? -My daughter. -So you got married. -No, you idiot. She's yours. Your daughter. -What? I don't have a daughter. -Now you do. Is this a joke? Do I look like I'm joking? I hope it's not. Let me explain. I don't have a daughter. I didn't have any. I won't have any! What do I do with one anyway? And she doesn't look like me at all. She sleeps. I never sleep. I'll tell you all about it but I came here with a cab and I don't have any money. Do you have 50 lira change? 50 lira is no change. It's paper. I don't have it on me. And now... My God... This is... For real... -That's all I have left. -OK. Let me give this to you. -And hold this please. -She's asleep. Won't she wake up? I'll be right back. You'll be here before she wakes up, Pınar? Because if she wakes up... Pınar. Sedat. 75 MINUTES LATER I think she's hungry. Is there a bottle in her bag? I don't think she's coming to get her back. She thinks she's mine. -What do you mean? -She says it's my daughter. Oh. Where are you going? This is a bit stressful for me, dear. It's a bit too complicated. -I should go. -But what about our weekend plans? You said you didn't want kids. You were single. I don't want any and I am single. Could you please listen? Drop it, for God's sake. -Aslı. Please listen to me! I'm single. -I'm late for the doctor's. -I swear I am. -Goodbye. You don't think that your mother... ...left you here like this, huh? You don't think she ran away or something? -Hello. -It's Pınar. Pınar. Pınar. Oh, Pınar. Where are you? Sedat... I'm so sorry. Take care of Duygu, OK? I can't do it. I really wanted and tried... ...but I couldn't. -My family doesn't know about her. -Wait a minute. -Please tell me where you are. -I can't. I'm so sorry. Pınar. What about the 50 lira? What kind of idiot am I? What kind of idiot? What to do? Calm, now. We'll figure it out. -Hello? -Ezgi, are you at the café? -Yes. -Great. I'll be right there. If you don't make a sound next time I leave you, I swear to God, I'll leave and never come back. Understood? Come on. Come on, Tarık. There's nothing to think about. Don't rush things, my dear. I need some time to think. There's only one move to make. I was thinking about that. See? What are you doing, Ezgi? Anyone know how to change diapers? Looks like that was all she needed. Of course, she was crying. -What's her name? -There was an ID. Duygu. And her father is Sedat Çıralı. How come? How is that even possible? I wasn't there. It's not so hard to find someone to do that. She didn't even eat a sandwich. -What sandwich? -A veggie sandwich. Oh, Tarık. I think you better keep her. It's time for you to start a family. What are you talking about, Ezgi? What about my job? What job? You're not a CEO or something! I can't take care of a kid. It will be the end of my life. Bye, freedom. Bye, tourist babes. You don't have anyone. No mother, no father, no siblings. You have us. She would do you good. No. I can't. Food, school, doctors... I can't even take care of myself. What do I do with this? I think you'd be a great father. You have a child's soul. You'll be her best friend. No, I can't. It's going to be difficult to feed her. I'll have to watch the same cartoon a thousand times. Then she will have boobs and ask me weird questions. She will date a maniac. She'll try to get married to an idiot. I'll hate both the boy and his father. Then she will start to defend them. And she will have kids of her own. You wouldn't do this to me, would you? Wow. Why don't you make a call to Angelina Jolie? She gets a baby from every country. She might take yours, too. I hope Angelina comes to get you, Tarık. Who's Anjeline? -I have an idea. -What? Let's go to your place. Move. -Let's go to my place. -Come on. I looked her up on Facebook and all the rest. She doesn't have anything. I just found a few pictures. -And that. -Give it to me. There should be something from Pınar around here. I would have remembered. There! I told you! -She's sent me a letter? -And you didn't even open it. Look at the stamp. It's been 18 months. -Isn't there an address or anything? -Just wait. Nope. None. She says, "I missed you. Especially when we were having a bath, your small..." OK. I remember everything now. Yes. Like marble. The hotel. I swear. Look at that. The texture. The trees. The garden. Magnificent. Sedat. Hotel Atlantis. -Where is Atlantis? -North of Yozgat. -Atlantis is the name of the hotel. -Oh. It looks like she spent some time over there. Maybe she worked there. It means you need to go to Istanbul. -To Istanbul? Never been. Never will. -Why not? What's in Istanbul? They eat people there. It's just a one hour flight. Piece of cake. He's scared of flying. I'm not scared of flying. I don't like the food they serve. -And the stewards are arrogant. -Sedat, my dear friend. That's your only chance. Either you go to Istanbul, or you accept being a father. That's a coincidence like fate. You'll see. You'll fall in love with her. She will become your everything. I'm begging you, don't cry. I'm so terribly sorry. She's not used to... What can I do? She's just a baby. Baby. What can I do? I'm not so used to it either. OK, you're not crying. Don't bite my hand. She's biting my hand. Shall I start to cry, now? Duygu, please. That's definitely not the right thing to do. Please, I'm begging you. A kid... It's just... She's upset because of exam results. Brother... You... Merciless... Merciless! I'm not coming! Yes. Don't cry. For God's sake. Stop. I don't know what to do either. And I think I'll start crying as well. It's a good thing that you stopped crying now. Don't think I don't love you because I'm taking you to your mother. You'll be much happier with her. You know my situation. And Istanbul is a great city. Fantastic schools. Movies, theaters... After all... ...it's a 5,000-year-old city! And you know, Istanbul is the bridge between Europe and Asia. You can go to school on any side. TWO HOURS LATER What now? Hungry again? Didn't you eat this morning? Stop, stop. Stop, OK. OK. What's that on your mouth? Stop. OK, I'm taking care of it. Good. You see? It's warm. OK. OK. Pınar! Stop. I'm coming! Here I am! Oh, what a lovely thing. -Where are you going? -To Istanbul. Hop in. I'm Şadan. -Thank you. In the back? -In the back. Your car is awesome. A real classic. I saw it in a newspaper, though. Air conditioning. A nice invention. It becomes like San Salvador. It hums gently. Unbelievable. But it's also good to keep the original. This is cooler. More authentic. With all that sweat dripping. What kind of smell is that? Is the kid sick or something? No. This one was a fart of mine. You better change it. I will. As soon as I find one that doesn't cry. -I'm talking about the diaper. -Why would I change it? Am I the father of this child? Aren't you the father? OK, right after I eat my sandwich. Now. Good idea. Because it started to become... Finally, brother. Why didn't you do it three hours ago? Look how relieved she is now. She could have waited for a gas station! She did it just like me. You are really like me, girl. My daughter. Thank you for everything, Şadan. -Farewell, Sedat. -Thank you. -Take good care of Duygu, OK? -OK. Thank you very much, Şadan. You're really a great man. -Excuse me. -Yes? I need to ask something. I'm looking for a friend. Pınar. Do you know her? Yes, I do know her. She was here for a yoga internship. And then they took her to the managerial floor. But she quit last year. I heard she moved abroad. -Abroad? -Yes. England. Or something. That's what I heard, but her best friend should know better. Who's that? I don't remember her name. But you'll find her there. Where is the managerial floor? In the other building. You can go by the pool. OK, thank you very much. But kids are not allowed there. OK, I'll find a solution. Thank you. Excuse me. Could I drop off my little girl for five minutes, can you keep an eye on her? Just right over here. -No problem. -Just keep an eye. -OK. No worries. -Thank you very much. So I'll just... Thank you. I'll be right back. Thank you very much. Come on, now. Computer effects, for God's sake! We need to do the real thing. I need a decent stuntman. The American has just left. You're so blind. He's going to jump from the tenth floor. -May I have Pınar's phone... -My friend. I'll say it one more time. Don't we have a stuntman that can jump from the tenth floor in our country? There never was? What are you talking about! Just go and see some Cüneyt Arkın movies. They did amazing things even though they didn't have today's technology. If they heard... The room is ready. The hotel is ready. We have the permission. I just need a stuntman before the crew comes back from lunch. That's it. What do you mean, no? Yes, the assistant is here. Showing me pictures of actresses. What is that? I need a 60-year-old mom! He's here with me. He just showed me the picture of a pretty girl. Huh. Yes. Tell that stupid casting director of yours that I will destroy her and her career. Could I ask for Pınar's phone number? Aren't you supposed to be working? Huh? What are you doing there? I just don't understand. Yes, your assistant is here. He's wandering around. Then what's this guy doing here? Why would I know his name? Just tell me you're going to find a stuntman. Duygu. Duygu. Duygu. Duygu. Can nobody hear me? Duygu! Help! I'm coming, Duygu. I'm coming. Roar! Roar! Roar. Roar. Roar. Roar. Roar! Sweetie, are you alright? Were you scared, my girl? I promise I will never leave you. Never. OK. OK. What did you do, my friend? What did you do? I have never seen anything like that. You jumped from the tenth floor without a blink for this little girl. You... I was waiting for a stuntman, you know? A foreign one. "Where is the safety rope?" "Not without an airbag." "Not after five o'clock." Someone who says things like that. But then you showed up. You're Turkish. You're a stuntman. I always say... "Do what no one else does." Right? -What was your name? -Sedat. Sedat. My dear Sedat. My Sedat. You're going to see... Money will flow... No, brother, I live in Çıralı. I'll take my girl back to Çıralı. We're doing good there. Sedat, what are you talking about? What Çıralı? This is Istanbul. Life is here. Everything is here. I don't really think it's good for us. I say you're going to be the number one. You'll be the king. Everybody will want to work with you. You're going to be so rich! Think of the future of this little girl. She will go to the best schools. Sedat. You have a God given gift, boy. Don't waste it. Please. I'm asking you. Because... ...this is your fate. This is your and her fate. TWO YEARS OLD Over here. Inwards. OK? Right here. THREE YEARS OLD FOUR YEARS OLD Did you draw this? -Yes. -Come here. Good girl. FIVE YEARS OLD My girl, Duygu. And the lion... Keep on sleeping, pretty girl. Come on, my girl. SIX YEARS OLD Happy birthday, Duygu. Go away! SEVEN YEARS OLD EIGHT YEARS OLD Roar. Roar. Roar. Roar. Roar. Roar. Roar. Roar. They're waiting for you. OK, I'll be there. Why do you go to the bathroom before every stunt? Are you scared? Why would I be scared? I'm concentrating. What does that mean? It means, I'm thinking. I think I've just heard your thoughts. -Where's your daddy, Duygu? -He's concentrating. OK, girl. You go to the set. I'll be coming with your father. Sedat, what's going on? Everybody's waiting for you. You know how much an hour costs. Every time I ask myself, why am I still doing this job? Because there is no one else who does it. You're making a ton of money working two days a week. Duygu is happy. I'm happy. Turkish moviemakers are happy. The advertisers are grateful. The TV people are still waiting for their turn. Everybody wants to work with you, Sedat. OK? This and that. Come on. Roar. Roar. Roar, Sedat. Come on. Come on, please. Roar. Come on. Roar. You know, my mother found Alpaslan's sword in France in a castle just like this one. Where's the boss' coffee? You won't believe what you see. This guy is really something. -Who's the girl? -His daughter. And his manager. He only speaks to her. You need to tell her what you want him to hear. -Why? -It's the guy's superstition. Oh, OK. Are you ready, Sedat? We're ready. Yes. OK? Ready. Scene 67. 1/1. Action. I'm asking you one last time. Where are Alpaslan's headquarters? I'll never tell. Never. Go to hell, sucker from Byzantium. Your choice. Cut. Good. No one moves, friends. Let's get our stuntman. -Is he ready? -Good luck. Guys, be careful. OK, we're ready. OK, we're clearing the set. Are you scared, Daddy? No way, what fear? I'm concentrating. You're really deep, this time. I'm breathing deeply. Don't you worry. Roar. -Ready. -Roar. Action. Roar. Roar! Cut. Are you OK, Sedat? That was good, Sedat. But remember, you are a fearless Seljuq soldier. Watch your expression while hitting the wall. OK? One more. Were you scared, Daddy? Never. Let's do one more. Give me your hand. Roar. One last time! Run. Move away. I'll handle this. No pain, no scar, no accident, no sadness could take you away from me. Why is it not working? No pain, no scar, no accident, no sadness could take you away from me. -You didn't knock on wood. -But I touched your head. Daddy. I want to become like you when I grow up. -A stuntman? -No. Immortal. Just like you. -Hello. -Hello, Duygu. Mr. Çıralı, your mail wouldn't fit in the box. So I took it. Thanks, Şükrü. And the payment for the water tank. But I gave it. I have a good memory. I never forget things like that. -I gave it yesterday. -You didn't. -I did. -You didn't. -I did. -You didn't. OK, I didn't. -There. -Thank you. I'll take a note. Great, OK. Come on. Daddy, is Şükrü a little forgetful? Yes. Mr. Çıralı... I wrote it but it looks like you still didn't pay for it. OK, Şükrü. Sedat, hello. -What's up, Ayşıl? -Good. Good. But the bathtub. It leaks again. I can't seem to stop it. Can you take a look? I'll come later. That'll be great. -Does it leak all over? -Yes, the whole bathtub. OK, no problem. Ah, Duygu. I'll see you later, OK. Bye! -Ayşıl's bathtub always leaks. -Yes, my dear. I think you'd better help her. Of course. It's always good to help neighbors. It's a good deed. Come on. Come on, now. Are you in? I am. Do you miss Grandpa? Of course I miss him. So tell me again. But you know it by heart now, Duygu. Just one more time. OK. -Your grandpa's name was Cesur... -Çıralı. He was afraid of nothing. No one. -He had a big... -Heart. No, he had a big beer belly. Come on, tell the truth. When I was just a little older than you, your grandpa took me to the Düden Waterfalls. We went all the way up. We looked down. The water was flowing and flowing. He brought me to the edge. I looked down. It was unbelievably high. He wanted me to be fearless. He waited. He waited. He waited. And suddenly he pushed me. Don't laugh. I was really scared. But after that day, I feared nothing. When will I jump from there? What jump? You'll never jump from there. Please, Daddy! I want to be fearless, too. Well done. Plenty of letters again. Let us see... Bills, letter from Özgil, bills, bills. My God, what is this? I don't understand. What is this? It's from my mother! She sent me a letter. "Dear daughter. It's been a long time since I wrote to you, because after I settled things between Batman and Superman, I had to go to Tanzania, Africa. It was a very important mission. The most beautiful baby rhinoceros of Tanzania was ill. And we had to save it. After I walked between trees for two days, I found the rhinoceros next to a river. Its horn was broken. So I took it to the hospital. And I had to fight jackals and bad hunters on the way. But in the end, we managed to save the rhinoceros. The Tanzanian government named the rhinoceros Duygu. There is a Duygu in Africa now. My dear girl, I miss you so much. I think about you all the time. My only consolation is that your daddy is always with you. Your daddy is the world's most good hearted, bravest, funniest and most handsome dad. You should be proud of him. He's the world's greatest dad. Tell your father to help Ayşıl with the leaks on her bathtub. It's a good deed. Your mother who loves you above all." A mother's heart. You know that you have a doctor's appointment? I won't go. Needles and a ton of medicine every time. I can't believe you're scared of needles. I'm not scared. Good God. I just don't want them to see my butt. I think you are scared to go by yourself. Would you like me to come? Would you come? Yes, but you need to learn to go by yourself. I cannot be with you all the time. What's that supposed to mean? What will you do when I go to college? When I get married? You need to learn to go to the doctor's by yourself. I won't let you get married. I can walk by myself from here. OK, good. Have a good one. Good morning, Mr. Çıralı. Could I see you for five minutes? Sure. Mr. Çınarlı, Duygu has a lot of absence days. She didn't come yesterday, either. She was with me on the Manzikert Hero set. A historical film. Like Conquest. Foundation. Salvation. Resurrection. Like The Resurrection of the Foundation. And the day before. We went to the park together. Duygu's teachers are concerned, too. Duygu has a very strong imagination. A little too much. What’s the problem? This is a very special stone. My mother brought it from the moon. But, Duygu, this looks like a normal stone. It's not. It's from the moon. My mother is the first Turkish astronaut. Listen, Mr. Çınarlı, I have never seen such an involved father. And Duygu is a happy girl. Isn't that the most important thing? Forgive me, but... her being in such an imaginary state of mind is not so healthy for the future. It seems like in order to make her forget the absence of her mother... If it's not too private, can I ask what happened to her? She went to pay the cab fare. See... It didn't hurt! I didn't feel the pain because you're here. Take good care of your father, Duygu. He has to take all his medicine, OK? Don't worry, Yıldırım. Where are my vitamins? Learn from Duygu. She never forgets her vitamins. Did you see the new toys in the waiting room? Where? Go check under the secretary's desk! I have no good news. The last treatment didn't work either. -How long do I have? -Not too much. I'm so sorry, Sedat. Daddy. Daddy. Are you OK? Daddy. Daddy. -What happened? -Nothing, my baby. -I think it's the needle. -Does it hurt too much? I mean, a little. But... ...you know what? What? Roar! Roar! Roar! Roar! Daddy. I'm feeling dizzy, Daddy. It was a shaky ride. Let's go home. Don't worry. I'm fine. Come, sweetheart. Oh, sorry, sweetheart. I thought you were my girl. -What happened, Duygu? -Nothing. I wish my mother was here. My friends are always making fun of me because I don't have a mother. Never mind. Let them take care of their own business. If she loves me so much, how come my mother never comes to see me? Let's just stop. Somewhere quiet. I have something to tell you, Birol. But I don't want to see the crowd. -Be quick. Say it. -So please just wait for a moment. I need two seconds. I need you to find an actress that will become Duygu's mother. Are you crazy? It's the most stupid thing I have ever heard. Please do it for Duygu. Are you a maniac? No way! I'll go for number 9. OK? Number 9. Please. Thank you. Welcome. Your name? -Nermin. -We're watching you, Nermin. Duygu. I'm your mother, Pınar. My dearest daughter. My baby. OK, miss. Thank you. Let's just tell her that her mother is in Somalia on a mission with James Bond! No. Enough with stories. She needs to meet her. -Do whatever it takes. -OK. So I'll pick one. Uhm... Number 3. Please. -Nod bad, huh? Number 3? -OK. -Welcome. Your name? -Hasan. I think number 9 is very good? A little makeup and it will be OK. Because 9 was like... Thank you, Miss. Thank you. Please. Quickly. If 9 is like that, then 10? I'm exhausted. Let's just not do this. Was that 3? I'm so nervous. -Who is this? -I'm Sedat. I came to pick Duygu up. Yes, Şükrü? I called him to fix Ayşıl's bathtub. That's a good thing to do, Duygu. I checked all the pipes but I found nothing. And now we need to pay him for his work. -Speaking of payment, the water tank... -OK. Let's take care of that. Please. Thank you for your service. Thank you, too, Mr. Çınarlı. I'll take note. Well done, girl. You became so thoughtful. -Come on, now. -Come on. -I'm really tired today. -I'm tired, too. Let's see what we’ve got here... Duygu. From Mommy. Mommy sent a letter. -Hello. -Hello. Hi. I'm Duygu's mother. Oh, yes. Duygu's mother. Yes. "Dear Duygu, I've just finished my meeting with Obama. Things are running smoothly in Palestine and Israel. Tomorrow I'm heading to the North Pole to save penguins. I heard that some penguins at the camp misbehaved a little and some others were hurt while gliding on ice. That's why they need help. As soon as I'm done there, I'll be coming to see you. This time nothing will stop me from seeing you. I've missed you so much. I can't wait for the moment I'll be hugging you." I understand you're being cold. No, it's just because we're on the phone. I'm warmer, normally. What I'm trying to say... I called because... No need to get excited. Birol will take care of everything about the payment. This has nothing to do with money. I know it's been a long time. It hasn't been that long... Sedat, we definitely need to meet and talk. I understand. Now if you're trying to... ...make arrangements for getting the job, let me tell you, it's Birol's decision. I mean it's Birol who is going to decide who Duygu's mother will be. What are you talking about? I'm Duygu's mother. It's Pınar. Pınar. Daddy! You won't believe it. -My mother is coming. -Your mother is coming. Her? I don't think so. No. Maybe. It's been a long time. Not her either. Thank God! That? -Not her, Dad. -Then where is that woman? Mommy? Duygu? Watch out. -Does Duygu know th... -Duygu doesn't know anything. She thinks we were married for three years and got divorced. And then... Dear. -Mommy. -Baby. This park is smaller than the ones in Africa, right? Of course it is, Duygu. Don't run. After I left the hotel, I went to England for a master's degree. I'm still there. I'm here for about a week every month. How did you find us? I found some news about you online. Then we tracked you through... We? My dad is a lawyer. So his firm... Great. So what are you going to do now? I'd like to spend more time with Duygu, now. -I want to become close with her. -Then? Then... I don't know. She's so sweet, so beautiful, Sedat. You raised her so beautifully. Thank you. I was worried for a second you wouldn't like your own daughter. -Mommy. -Baby. After you went to Africa after meeting Batman and Superman... -I did what? -It's getting late. Shall we get some ice-cream and go home? My mother is coming with us, right? You like it? -Is it all yours? -Half of it is my father's. I can't believe it. After your apartment in Çıralı... Çıralı. Have you ever been to the Mediterranean for a mission, Mother? -What mission? -Mission, expedition, all these... international travels. Everything you've accomplished. -The ones for the United Nations... -What? They got united. You're a hero, Pınar. We're proud of you. I have all your letters. I know by heart all the places you went to. Come. My letters? Your letters. The ones you wrote from all around the world. I kept them all. How you split the swell, how you found Noah's Ark, your race with Lightning McQueen, how you saved Private Ryan, how you found the sword of Alpaslan and how you healed the rhinoceros. And there's more. There are quite a few... At least once a week. Brad Pitt, George Clooney, Kıvanç Tatlıtuğ, they are all here. Oh, Messi. I don't know what they like about this boy. Did you forget about the signed picture you sent to Duygu? I didn't. No. I remember. Was it too cold in Everest, Mommy? Duygu, why don't we talk a little about you. How is your life? How is school? How are your friends? I am so curious. School is good. My friends are good, too. Tell me, was it too cold? Was it cold? Yes, a little, of course. The more you go up... -She's asleep. -That's how she is. As soon as her head touches the pillow... Why didn't you tell her the truth? I don't know. I thought about it but... I didn't know how to do it. I couldn't tell her that her mother didn't want her, left her and never called once. -Thank you. -I didn't do it for you. Sedat, you did a great job. She is magnificent. Smart, happy, full of life. I don't know what would have happened without you. I'll sleep here. You go in my bedroom. OK? Good night. Good night. My mom is here. My mom is back. I told you. This is my mother. My mom came. My mom. Here is my mother. That's my mom. It's her mother. The cab driver had no change... You said that you were going to tell me something. Oh, yes... That... -Yes? -Four years ago, in Mardin, we were shooting The Legend of Manzikert 8. It was sort of a series. I had a little accident, there. It's normal. Part of the job. And they brought me to a private hospital. Duygu was there, too. -The doctors told me... -Sorry. -I need to answer this. -Sure. Hello? Now? OK. I'll be there. The meeting I had... They rescheduled it for earlier. I need to be there. Taxi! I really have to go. You were talking about the Legend of Manzikert Mardin? The Legend of Manzikert 8. I jumped from the tower on the seventh. I hit the floor at the end. But the eighth starts with the fall... Anyway, you have more urgent things to do. And my head... I don't want to rush this matter. OK, so I'll call you after the meeting? -OK, sure. -OK. And I didn't have the time to take cash out. Do you have 50 lira on you? Won't you come back? So you didn't tell her? I didn't have the chance. But I decided not to tell her. Why not? I think you need to. Why? You know it. I know it. That's enough. I don't need anyone else's pity. So you say... So what did you feel when you saw her? At first, I didn't recognize her. Because she was... The prince goes first. The prince first. There. On the side. -Sorry. -It's OK. She was like someone else. She was a lot prettier than I remembered. -You know, years ago... -I told you something. You kill the prince first, then the mother. The vizier goes last. The vizier is the last one. There is an order for this. It's that simple. -I'm sorry, Sedat. -It's OK. Do I have to say this? I didn't show it, but I was impressed with her. The last time I saw her she was kind of different, she was weird. I said, The Prince! Don't you understand? Why is it so hard? The prince goes first. -Sorry, Sedat. -It's OK. She seemed more judicious, rational. I even thought to myself to take her to dinner. This is not a massage. You need to choke him. Just choke him already. Enough is enough. -This is how you do it. -Sedat, just keep away. -And you hold it. -OK. -Everyone chokes the other. -They will choke them. -Do you miss Çıralı? -A lot. Didn't you take Duygu to Çıralı? I think I've talked so much about it that I'm afraid she'll be disappointed. -She's asleep again. -This is Duygu. She sleeps everywhere. How did you leave her? Excuse me? Why did you come back? Why now? I told you. I was curious. I wanted to see her. To know her. I thought I could make up for my mistake. Or just to relieve yourself? To feel better about yourself? Maybe at the beginning. But it all changed after I met her. I was struck. Now that I think about it... if things were different, we could be a family. Why can't we? Are you serious? Yes. Why not? Not for me or for you. That's Duygu's biggest wish. Do you do everything she asks you to? Almost. It's not necessary for us to be together just to make her happy. And I'm engaged. How? We met in England. He's Turkish, too. He will come and meet Duygu tomorrow. Is that OK with you? No problem, of course. My father is taller. My father has more hair. My father... ...is more like my father. -Welcome. -Hello. -This is Duygu. -Hello, I'm Kaan. -Her father, Sedat. -Hello. Have a seat. I heard your father is a stuntman. Is that right? He's the best stuntman in Turkey. In Europe! He does scenes no one else does. He flies from cars, hangs from cliffs, fights wild animals, -spills water from his eyes. -When did I do that? -You did it just that once. -Oh, that. Just a small trick. No movie can be shot without my father. It means he is really brave. It comes from Grandpa. His name is Cesur Çıralı. -It really was Cesur Çıralı. -Oh. Daddy, shall we invite mommy and Kaan to the set? Let's show them how courageous you are. He's gonna jump from the eighth floor, OK? OK, I'll tell him. Tell your dad he's gonna jump from the eighth floor. I wanted the tenth floor, but they said no. My dad can easily jump from the 12th floor. Are you sure? What's going on, Duygu? They want you to jump from a higher point. OK, but only one more. OK? I think this will be high enough. I'd rather jump from the floor below, though. -OK. -What's he saying? This is OK, but he wants 10,000 lira more. And a PlayStation. Deal. You're one brave man, mister. Yeah, it's OK, teacher, me too, fine. Thanks and yes... Are we OK, he understood? He doesn't look like he got it quite right. Duygu. OK. Everybody back to one. Let's have our actor and stuntman ready. What? Isn't it early? The lights aren't set yet. The director could be mad, you know. It happened this one time we were early. I jumped one day before I should have. I'm begging you. Please don't do this. Don't to it. I'm begging you. Brother, I'm begging. Cut. Send in the stunt. Prepare the stuntman. You'll see how brave he is. The bravest man in the world. You know, he jumped from a waterfall when he was ten. Really? He promised me. He's going to make me jump too. Everything is ready. What is ready? No one told me about this set-up. Kids, I'm starting to get nervous. Hold it. Which floor are we on? This is too high. We didn't agree on this. This is too high. We just spoke with the director. Action. Please. Just a minute. Just a minute. I'm begging, please. I'm really begging. This is too high for me. It's not supposed to be like that! I'm begging you guys, please. Wow, he's a really good actor. It's time to end it. Sir! I'm saying please! What kind of building is that? I'm begging you. Please. I'm begging! Sir! Let's cut! Cut! I cut it! I did it! What's going on? Why did he yell "cut"? Sir, he never agreed to it. His daughter was lying. You, did you lie to me? I thought it was real. What happened? Brother, Duygu said that you agreed on the 12th floor. That's why he's angry. What's going on? We had a deal. This is unbelievable. OK, Duygu is right. I'm going to jump. I just wanted it to be more realistic. It was part of the act. Tell that prick not to yell at my girl. I'll jump. OK. Teacher, I'm coming. I'm ready. OK? I'm ready. Yeah. Come on. See how it's done. OK. I'll jump. OK. Roar. Roar. Roar. Roar. I'm ready. Action. Roar! God! -Run! -Come! Sedat! Did you shoot? Don't be alarmed. It happens every time. Then I resurrect him. Move away. -Move away. -Let him breathe. Step back. No pain, no scar, no accident, no sadness could take you away from me. What did Duygu tell you today? -That "No pain, no scar" thing. -It's our play. Like a spell. I pretend to be dead. And she brings me back to life. Aren't you scared that it might become real? Who will take care of her if something happens to you? You have no family. No relatives. And your job is very dangerous. This is just how I can give her what she needs. Aren't you spoiling her? What's the matter? A little love and affection won't hurt anyone. But you are exaggerating. She lives in a dream world. Our daughter is shining despite all the bad things in this world. Because she doesn't live in the real world. What is it to you? What gives you the right to tell me all this after all these years? I'm her mother. You can't be her mother just by saying it, Pınar. I'm in her life now. Whether you accept it or not. Duygu, we're going to see each other a lot more. We're going to live in London with Kaan for a while, but I'll come and see you every month. And maybe you would like to come to see us during holidays. If your father lets you. Aren't you going to travel around the world and help animals? Aren't you going to save people? Duygu... I've never been to the moon. Nor the North Pole. Nor Africa. I've never met Batman. Your father told you these stories... ...because he didn't want you to know that... You lied to me. He had to. I always wanted you to love and remember your mom. All this doesn't matter anymore. We will be together, from now on. I'll always be with you. From London, Mom? Duygu, I'll see you soon, OK? Why can't I come with you? You will come during holidays, sweetie. But I want to come now. But you need to go to school. Just for a few days. Please? But if you come with me your dad will be all alone. My father is always with me. I just want to spend more time with my mother. Pınar, we'll miss the flight. Let her miss the flight. But please stay a little longer. I promise you, I'll be back as soon as I can. OK? Don't be sad. -Liar. -What? You're a liar. You tricked me. Liar. -What's going on? Just calm down. -Just leave. Please listen. -Get out of my room. -Duygu... Get out of my room. I don't love you anymore. Go. What happened, Duygu? Did your mom go on holiday with Spider-Man? Sedat Çıralı is not home. I need to give this document to him personally. There he is. What is it, Şükrü? -The water tank issue is still... -I'll take care of the water tank. There is a document for you. I need an ID. Sure. Good God. Let's go. Thank you. -What is it? -A notice of legal process. Your honor... ...it is true that I left my daughter and haven't seen her for years. And I deeply regret that. Her father, Sedat, tried his best while I wasn't around. And I can't deny he did the best he could. But our daughter lives in a dream world. She thinks her father is immortal. Instead of going to school, she spends her time on film sets with her father and watches him risk his life. I don't think this should be acceptable for an eight-year-old girl. Duygu needs some order, somebody who knows the required responsibilities. Duygu needs her mother, Your Honor. That's why I need to take custody of my child. It is decreed that... ...in order to listen to other statements and gather professional counseling, the next session will be held on July 12th. In the meantime, by having to let the father know 24 hours in advance, it is permitted that the mother, Pınar Bilgeli, sees her daughter twice a week. Sedat, you need to find a more secure job. According to the ministry of labor, it's the third most dangerous job. Really? What are the first two? Construction worker and bomb disposal expert. -Pınar. Why? -Please, later. Sedat, please. I need a minute. I need to say something. Why are you trying to separate us? Because anything can happen to you. This was out of the question a month ago. You were going to see her on holidays. Why now? Why are you trying to take Duygu away from me? Answer me. Why? Because I'm her mother. Because I fell in love with her the moment I saw her. Because it won't be enough to see her only on holidays or a week per month. Do you understand? Because I don't want a life without her. Do you want to go live with your mother? I know, OK. You hang around together today and I'll meet you later at home. OK? I can feel they are going to take her away from me. And she would want her mother, too. What more could I do for her? If Duygu wants it too, they'll take her away from me. Why would they take her? Could they find a better father? What if they do? Why don't you tell about the situation? They won't touch you if you do. You could keep her, then. What would I do without her? Think positive. Do "Karma". Do "Secret". Do "Whammy". Do something. Holy Turkish Justice. Your Honor. Sedat... ...for his daughter... ...has jumped from the tenth floor. I witnessed it. That's how we met. On that day, I saw... ...how he adores his daughter. I'm asking you, Your Honor, how many fathers would do that? What kind of dad would leave his ten-month-old daughter next to a pool, tie her to the ceiling to keep her from falling from the bed? Mr. Çınarlı is a great father. He does everything she needs. Anything you can imagine... He can't draw a line between loving and spoiling. Mr. Çınarlı is a great person, as far as I'm concerned. Pınar is one of the strongest people I've known. She is my life. I'm here for years. For her. I can't tell if I'm a good father. But there is one thing I know. She's happy when she's with me. Your Honor, if somebody told you you had a child and you needed to take care of her... and that you would become attached deeply, and if that same person, years after she'd become all you've got, came and told you, "Enough. This is my child. Give her back," what would you do? What would you say? Would you give up on your child? Would you give up? She is my life. What is it with you? I don't know. I swear, it's like in American movies. I'm so excited. Before announcing the verdict, I'd like to say something personal. According to the laws, in general, when there is a case that concerns custody, the tendency is towards the mother. I'm a mother. And I think it's the right thing to do. But, in this case, my conscience and my authority tells me to do the opposite. We have with us a father... ...who changed his life for his daughter... ...and who jumped from the tenth floor of a building to protect her... ...and who looks up to her above any other matter. The only parent the girl has ever known. And because he was both the mother and the father for this child, I grant custody to Sedat Çıralı. Please take note. It is considered by the court. You shouldn't have told him she was his daughter. So what is it? Are we wrapping everything up? You heard the judge. She has to have a normal life. She will go to school regularly. And you won't fly off the roofs. Let the ladder stay, Duygu. Leave it. Oh, Erdal. Come. What is it? Pınar appealed to the court again. She wants a DNA test. I'm sorry, Mr. Çınarlı. Your daughter. -What? I don't have a daughter. -Now you do. Duygu, are you ready? Here. Keep this. You'll remember me. Can I give you 50 lira for the cab? OK, sure. Duygu, I'm waiting downstairs. Remember, you're my everything. You too. And I don't want to go. Don't leave me, Daddy. I can't live without you. Sedat. Sedat, we're getting late. Sedat. Sedat, we're late. Sedat. Duygu. Move away. Duygu? Sedat? Why didn't we come here by car? Because they would have looked for it. Then why are we walking, Daddy? I just wanted you to see this road. We walked on it years ago. So there it is. What do we do when we get there? -Whatever you like. -I'd really like a Turkish coffee. Good idea. What's that! Is it Şadan? -What happened? -Nothing. Come. Come. Come here. Hello, could you... -Jump in. -Great. Come, my baby. It's the same! Come on, Tarık. It's been half an hour. I need to think, for God's sake. Wait. Sedat! -I can't believe it. -Wow, Sedat. -Where did you come from? -Where is the baby? Just come here. Let me look at the baby! Magnificent! My God! Look at her. -She grew up. -Didn't she? What an unfaithful man you became. You didn't come to see us even once! Like you came to Istanbul all the time. I have a hard time bringing Tarık to the café. And he never wants to leave Çıralı! Never mind. We're here from now on. What a beautiful girl you became. Come over here. -What did I tell you? -Nothing to say. You were right. Thanks to you, your coward dad saw Istanbul. My dad's a coward? Yes, he couldn't even climb on a chair to change a light bulb. -He had a fear of heights. -I don't believe it. This is true. But thanks to you and my dad, I conquered all my fears. Princess, what would you like to do? I want to realize my biggest dream. What is it? -We're going to jump from the waterfalls. -Downwards? -Let me introduce you to your Tarık. -Pleased to meet you. Downwards. -Birol, where are they? -I don't know. Please tell us where they are. Or else, Sedat will be in trouble. I don't know. I am asking you. Where is my daughter? I know you know. I said, I don't know. I wouldn't tell even if I knew. Listen, brother. You really need to tell us where they are before I tear this place apart and put you all in jail. That maniac, irresponsible friend of yours has kidnapped Pınar's daughter. Just tell us where they are. Politeness! Who the hell are you? That maniac, irresponsible man you're talking about... ...for the last four years has been asking himself if it's the last day he's spending with her. Roar. -Roar. -Roar. -Roar! -Roar! Isn't it more beautiful than the waterfall? There are worse things in life than being pushed from a waterfall. Finally, I understand what my father did. It was just his way of saying "I love you, son." He didn't use words. He did it by pushing me, by getting me ready for life. Wolves were always there, but thanks to Duygu, I have learned a lot about fear and life. Sometimes eight years is worth 80 years... ...and sometimes, with 50 lira, you make the best investment possible. Seeing her happiness was worth everything. While she was running on the sand I asked myself when she would get tired. It didn't last long, but hey... ...life is full of coincidences and surprises... ...and my surprise was that girl who was full of life. And sometimes, the surprise is a little hole in your heart that you have since the day you were born. And the doctor's was that he simply didn't have an explanation. And one day, that hole in the heart, grows wider like a butterfly. It puts you in a coma or you fall into a sleep that you'll never wake up from. Finally, it happened. Duygu left us two weeks after... ...she realized her biggest dream. ONE YEAR LATER There are worse things in life than being pushed from a waterfall. I live with the memoires of the two people I loved the most. One taught me how to start to live, and the other to keep on living no matter what. I know that Duygu is somewhere up there, on a waterfall, happy next to her grandpa. They give me power even if they're not here with me. They keep me going.
