Who's ready to get married? Maggie! You definitely saved the day, Maggie. All in a wedding day's work. I still don't see how you got the dress across town so quickly. Well, a professional bridesmaid never reveals her secrets. Oh, they are ready for photos and the bride is looking for you. Ok, uh, oh. Hold this. Are these... veil weights? Yeah. So, the breeze doesn't blow the veil out of place. What else have you got in there? Anything a bride might night. You know, we've got, uh, stress balls. Chalk to cover up any wine stains. Uh-huh. EpiPen for any guest who forgot to mention - that they have a nut allergy. - Ah. And I always keep a stand-in wedding ring. You'd be shocked how often the best man loses the real one. Maggie... We're about to do photos outside but I'd love to get one with you and the bridesmaids. Yeah, of course. I wouldn't miss it. Oh, I'll talk to you later? 9:00 PM your place. - Let's go, let's go! - Have fun. [Bride] Say bridesmaids! [camera shutter clicks] [cheerful music] [doorbell rings] You are a lifesaver. Actually, I'd say you are. The way the bride's parents were singing your praises. Business is booming, I take it? A little too much, actually. I have been spending so much time at weddings lately that when I try to go to sleep, I actually count groomsmen. They're never where they're supposed to be. - Groomsmen? - Yeah. Maybe your subconscious is trying to tell you something. Yeah, that I need a vacation. I was going to say romance. Oh! Haha. Very funny. Too bad you couldn't clone yourself. My thoughts exactly. Which is actually why I have been planning to scale my business. So, after I get seed money, I was thinking of hiring five bridesmaids, training them and then I can spread happiness far and wide. I even wrote up a little business plan. Professional Bridesmaids Inc. Mmhmm. Maggie! That is a fantastic idea. Thanks. Now, if only the bank agreed. They just shot down my loan request yet again. They need references but I can't give up my clients. Yeah, that's the thing about this job. A lot of clients want you under the radar so doing it well means no one knows that you're working at all. Well, I may have a solution. Yeah? I know you were planning on taking a break, but... you heard that over on Columbus the mayor's daughter's getting married? Yeah, I mean, hard not to. It's like Ohio's version of a Kennedy wedding. Well, their wedding planner dropped out. Well, actually, more like got fired. What? What happened? He was getting kickbacks from the vendors and the mayor doesn't want even a hint of bad press. Anyway, they hired me to replace him. What? Nora, that's amazing. Oh, my gosh. You're gonna nail it. Thanks! But, with a stressed-out bride and the wedding in only two weeks, they could really use someone like you. And maybe it'll help with your loan situation. They mayor has a lot of connections, including bankers. Maybe a word from him is exactly what you need. Ooof. I mean, that would be amazing. Glad you think so 'cause I already mentioned you to the mayor and he's intrigued. This could be great for the both of you. I don't know, two weeks? I mean that's like, really, really soon. I know, I know it is, but, you'll talk to him anyway, right? Ok. Ok, I will talk to him. Yes! [glasses clink] [camera shutter clicks] How's this one? The focus group's prefer the sleeves rolled up, sir. Ready to take hold of the city's biggest problems. Spoken like a true campaign manager. [knocking] Hi. Can we help you? Your uh, your wedding planner called me. I'm Maggie Bailey. Right, you must be the... - Let's take five, shall we? - Yeah. Please. Oh, thank you. You must be the... I, I... I don't actually even know what you call it. The professional bridesmaid. Right. So, how is that different from a wedding planner? My job is all about bridal support. So, a meddling mother in law? I have museum day passes handy. Bickering bridesmaids? I keep spas on speed-dial. See the, uh, the pressures of being a bride can be really overwhelming and so my job is to keep it easy and fun while handling all those last-minute problems that always seem to come up. Oh, and they will. That's what my wife used to say. Yeah. Um... we lost my wife, Carol, three years ago. Oh. She was the perfect partner in every way. I wouldn't have been elected to the school council, let alone mayor if not for her grace and tact. Well, I'm so sorry. She sounds very special, sir. She was just like Alexis. Lexi stepped right into her shoes. She helped keep my constituents happy and I want to give her the wedding she deserves. Our current challenge is the mayor is facing a special election in just under two months and we've invited press to cover the wedding. I completely understand, and if you hire me, I will take as much off the bride's shoulders as possible. Alright then. Let's give it a try. Thomas will help you with the details. Right. Now, you still live in Logan, correct? Yeah. Perfect. No one here should recognize you. Uh... Discretion is of the utmost importance to us. Ok, yeah, for me as well. For what I do, discretion is vital. Good. So I and Thomas here and uh Lexi will be the only ones who know who really are. Oh, and Nora. Nora, yeah, the wedding planner. Um, she told me about your bank issue. Oh. Emma Spencer from Midwestern Savings is an advocate of women-led business. She'll be at the wedding, and, uh, I'd be happy to introduce you. Oh, wow, um, a referral like that would be amazing. And you'll move into the mansion until after the wedding. Of course. Um, uh... Of course? It's better for us that you're on call and as close to Alexis as possible. This is Lexi's big day and I want everything to go perfectly. And most of all... no bad press. No bad press. No bad press. You got it. [Maggie] So yeah, that's it. I'm hired. I knew they'd see your value. Well, thanks again, Nora. And hey, if you see the bride, will you tell her that I will be there soon to meet her and give her my background story. Hi. Sounds good. Where are you? Um, I think it's called Evergreen Park? Yeah, it's some hiking trail I passed on my way into town. And lucky for me, I had my gym bag in the car. Did I tell you that they want me on call? Yes, and living at the mansion. I'm there now. The bride says she wants to have the ceremony right here on this property, but this old barn's gonna need a lot of work. Well, hey, if anyone can do it, it's you, Nora. Thanks, hun. So, I'll talk to you later. - Bye. - Bye. [Henry] Woah! Oh no! Look out! - Ok! - Oh! Are you ok? Yeah, no, I'm ok. I'm fine. Are you ok? Yeah, I'm fine. I mean, my pride's never gonna recover. - [laughing] - I'm so sorry. My friend lent me his bike because mine's in the shop, and he didn't tell me that the back break, like, pops out. - It's ok. - Ok I promise. It's ok. No, I was just coming out here to destress and... Yeah, I guess I gotta start again. I don't know. Yeah, me too. Me too. I come out here to zen out. I needed it today 'cause I'm starting a new job this afternoon. Oh, uh, do you mind if I help you then? You've got some, yeah... ok turn around, you've got some... yeah. Oh, ok, ok, I think you're good. Yes, very presentable. - Thank you. - Yeah. I could say the same for you. Well, nothing more healing than being out in nature, right? Right. Breathing in the fresh air and listening to the wind. Mmhmm. Getting a little carried away, aren't I? Oh, no, no, not at all. I mean, you make it sound very poetic. I don't know... There's a word for it. Yeah, no there is. It's, uh, Shinrin-Yoku. Well, otherwise known as uh, [both] Forrest bathing. Great minds think alike. [chuckles] Yeah. [phone chimes] Oh, that's my, uh, it's my... I gotta... Oh. - Yeah. - Yeah. I mean, enjoy your de-stressing. - Thank you. - Cool. Good luck. Oh, oh, you've got... uh... No, no, that's fine. I'll, Ill, I'll get it later. Ok. Alright. - Ok, bye. - Bye. It's always sad when a great paper like the Register News shuts down, but Columbuzz is happy to have you. Thank you, Kay, I'm excited to hit the ground running. Sorry, we couldn't bring you on staff quite yet but I'm sure you're going to ace this. Ok, so where do I start? Local desk, crime beat? Actually, I have an assignment you'd be perfect for. I understand you cover City Hall and interviewed Mayor Shepard? Yes, several times. Oh, what's the angle? Is it tensions with the Development Board? Or maybe how close his election is running? Actually, his daughter, Alexis, is getting married in a couple weeks to a pro hockey player. Uh, and... And it's going to be a high-profile event with national appeal and we're the only site granted full access. Our wedding guy's on paternity leave so I need you for this. Uh, ok. Well Kay, I do, um, serious news. So, you want me to do a story on a wedding? I see a series. 500-800 words a day in the run-up. Each one a new theme. Dress, flowers, profiles. So... so, I'm more um, like Woodward and Bernstein and it sounds like you want Martha Stewart. Henry, there's a reason why th Regiswent under and we're thriving. Like I said in the interview, we do some politics but our main focus is listicles, celebrities, games. But I don't know anything about weddings. I know you want to do political news, Henry. [Henry] Yeah. [Kay] But I need you to do the wedding first. Remember, this job's on a trial basis. You deliver on the wedding, consider yourself permanent here. The next story you write can be whatever you want. Well, I have been trying to interview the mayor about his position on the rezoning of Evergreen Park. There's a council vote coming up on whether to build condos. [Kay] Mmm. So, maybe I could quickly try to corner him while I'm there? If there is an opportunity, but focus on the wedding first. Deal? Deal. [cheerful music] Woah. Hi, um, are you with the florist or the caterer? I'm so sorry, my schedule's a mess. Oh, no, that's ok. I'm actually the professional bridesmaid. You must be Alexis. I'm Maggie. Oh, right. Hi. It's so good to meet you. Come in. Thank you. You can leave your bags here. Ok. Follow me. I have to admit, I was a little skeptical when my dad talked about hiring you. Well, you know what? That is totally normal. But I am just here to give you a little bit of extra help. So, I understand that your cousin is your Maid of Honor? Yes. Chloe. And the other bridesmaids, Ruthie and Shannon were my sorority sisters in college. Got it. Please have a seat. Thank you. Uh, so how has it all been going so far? Um, honestly? Everything's moving in a million different directions. Shannon is a fashion influencer who's really blowing up right now and Ruthie is planning her own wedding while juggling law school and Chloe... is Chloe. What do you mean? Well, I love my cousin, but she's younger in more ways than one and not the most organized person. She really wanted to be Maid of Honor so I said yes. We used to be closer but she's been off traveling and I thought this would be a good opportunity to reconnect. She's planning the bridal shower and struggling. Well, that is totally something that I can help you with, so don't worry. How is the groom holding up? Um, Dylan? With playoffs, I feel like I barely see him. But, his season's ending so he should be back soon. I kind of feel like you're handling a lot of this on your own. Yeah. [tender music] Is that... is that your mom? You know, your dad told me what happened. I'm so sorry, Alexis. Thank you. I do wish she could be at the wedding. Of course. But, her friend, Darlene, is going to be there. We stayed in touch and her and my mom were so close. So it'll be like having a little piece of her at the wedding with me. [phone chimes] Oh. We are meeting up with the bridesmaids soon. So let's get you settled in. Yeah. Oh, you know what, I should probably give you my cover story then, before you go. I may have jumped the gun on that. So, I was out with the girls last night for drinks and they asked about you and I just froze and there was a bottle of wine in front of me, so I might have told them that you're a wine distributor in from New York. You know, I went to school in Ithaca, so... I can roll with that part. I just... might have to wing it with the whole wine thing. I also told them your name is Maisie. Maisie? Uh... Ok. It was the first name that popped into my head. My mom bought her for me when I was 10. She always made me feel safe. Well, then Maisie it is. Alright, shall we go meet the other bridesmaids? - Yes. - Ok. [upbeat music] ♪ Ladies... I would like to introduce you to Maisie. Maisie, this is Chloe, Ruthie and Shannon. Hi. Hi! It's nice to meet everybody. Likewise, hi. Funny Alexis never mentioned you before, Maisie. Oh, well, I've heard of all of you. Yes, Chloe, our intrepid world traveler. So jealous. And Shannon, our fashion icon, which, by the way, I am your newest fan. And Ruthie, I heard that you are planning your own wedding while also juggling law school.. I mean, that's... that's amazing. I know it sounds like a lot, but I promise it won't be a distraction. [phone chimes] [gasps] I got the Powell's room for my shower! [laughing] Yes! Oh, sorry. How does everybody feel about margaritas? Oh, yeah. Excuse me. Margaritas for the table, please. Absolutely. Shannon, do you think you'd survive 30 minutes without sharing anything? Sorry. It's part of the gig, gotta feed the followers. So Maisie, how do you know Alexis? Oh, uh... We, uh, met on a cruise when we were younger. Yeah. A cruise? I don't remember you going on any cruise. Don't you remember? You were gonna come but you decided to go to that camp in New York? Don't tell me you don't remember Anthony Whats-his-name? Oh, right! That was the summer that you found romance novels and I thought I was living one. [laughs] But Maisie... Maisie, why is that name so familiar? Oh, by the way, Chloe, if you need anything at all for the bridal shower, I am here to help. I've got everything covered. I'm closing in on where we'll hold your bridal shower, Alexis. Oh, oh, so nothing's locked in yet for that? No. But, I've put out feelers and I'll find a venue soon and everything will fall into place. So, you know, since the bridal shower's only four days away, what if I took a thing or two off of your plate for that? Like, going over the guest list or flowers, or literally anything. Thank you, but as I said, I've got things well in hand. - Ok. - Of course. I'm sure you do. Though, since you're our wine expert, maybe you can order the wine for the shower. What's the name of the winery you work for? Oh, it's up, it's Chateau... um, Chateau des Gateaux, yeah. House of cakes? Oh, you speak French. I do. I would link to your site but there's no social media presence. Oh, yeah, you know, it's a really, really tiny label. - Super small. - Yeah. Drinks? - This one's for you. - Thank you. Here you go, Chloe. Oh. Thank you. [Shannon] Ok, hang on. Wedding selfie! Everyone say bridesmaid! [all] Bridesmaid! Ah, sir. You won't believe the reporter who's been assigned to cover the wedding... Henry Whittington. Mr. Relentless? Mm. I thought the Registry went under. It did. He's resurfaced at that website we've already said yes too. Right. He's gonna ask me about Evergreen Park. Taking a position either way will alienate 50 percent of the voters, so, I think, it's best that you avoid him at all costs. I agree. Oh my gosh! So sorry. - I'm sorry. - Sorry! - Oh, you. - You. - Hi. - Hi. Wait, what are you doing here? Um, somebody let me in. 'Cause I'm a reporter. I'm covering the wedding. Oh, I'm a... I'm a bridesmaid. Wait, let me guess. Matching pink dresses and matching pink shoes. You know, actually, the tradition of matching bridesmaids goes back to Roman times when the bride's friends would dress alike to confuse evil spirits. - Oh. - Yeah. What are you, a bridesmaid expert? Oh. [laughs] No, I just have a lot of cousins, so I've been to a lot of weddings. I'm Henry. Oh. I didn't catch your name. Oh, I'm a Mag-zee. Maisie Ryder. - Maisie. - Yeah. That's an interesting name. Thanks. You know, it's so funny. It's so funny that we met here again. [laughing] You know, we may not be hiking this time, but I am definitely lost in the woods, 'cause, you know, I don't usually cover weddings. - Oh, yeah. - Right. What do you do? Oh, I'm a... I'm a wine distributor in from New York. I, uh, am gonna stay here through the wedding. Right on time, Mr. Whittington. Thomas Melon. Thomas. Yes, we met before. Yes. Yes, I remember. Alexis and Dylan are just in the other room around the corner. I will join you in a minute. Ok. Ok, well I'll see you later, Maisie. Bye. Do you know that reporter? Uh, we... we just... we actually just ran into each other on a hike. So, no, I don't... I don't actually really know him. Well, please try to keep it that way. He's going to be around here a lot. So... you two met at a fundraiser? Yes, my father was speaking at a barbecue to raise money for after-school sports. It's a charity I volunteer with. And I was talking to some kids and I went over to the lunch table to get a burger. Dylan got the last one, but then he gave me his and it was so sweet and he just, he just gave me this look. Hunger? [Dylan] More like love at first sight. And then we just clicked. Did you raise the money for the after-school programs? Mmhmm. Double over what we raised the year before. What did you spend it on? Which specific programs? And did that effect your funding from the city or did that remain constant? May I remind you, you are here to write about a wedding. Not the municipal budgets. Right. Yeah, sorry. Sorry. Um, instinct. I used to be an investigative reporter. Trust me, I know. Well, this seems like a good place to stop for now. I believe you two have another appointment. - Yes? - Thank you. Oh, yeah. Thank you. Thanks. Thomas? Um, you know, as long as I'm here, I would love to speak with the mayor about his position on the future of Evergreen Park. Well, I'm sure you understand the mayor's a busy man. I do, it's just that Evergreen Park is such an important issue. Henry, just focus on the wedding. Please. That was not my best work. Oh. Guess I'm a little rusty when it comes to human interest stories. Hm, that's one way to put it. I just can't help it though. I've always been an investigative reporter. You know, when I was six I busted Santa Claus with a video camera and a trip wire. Oh. The truth is, I don't really know much about weddings though. You speak bride. Do you mind if I use that info on the bridesmaids dresses that you gave me? Sure, yeah. I'm happy to help. I might have to reach out. You know, just if I have any follow-up questions. Well, you know where to find me, so... In the spirit of the wedding, I do! Uh, do you want me to walk you out? - Sure, yeah. - Ok. Hey, Alexis. How's it going? Um, Nora texted. Chloe muddled the order for the centerpieces for the shower and now everybody is texting me, asking where to go for the shower because it's not updated on the bridal website, but we don't have a location. So... Well, hey, Alexis, this is exactly the sort of thing that I am here to help you with, ok? Look, first, I am going to iron out the mishap with the florist. And I have a connection at the Arbor Club. That would be the perfect location for your shower. And you know what? I can get them to contact Chloe, so she won't even know that I helped. - That would be great. - Yeah. [phone chimes] Shannon just texted. Apparently some designer she knows wants to provide the bridesmaids dresses, but we chose the dresses. Well, I'll handle that too. You just tell me what you want me to do. Whatever causes the lease conflict. Ok, Alexis, this is your wedding. You get to decide what you want. The colors, the styles, everything. I just want everything to go smoothly. Did you know that Dylan's team wanted us to use the team colors for the wedding? What are the team colors? Red, white and blue. Even Thomas thought it would be too on the nose for the campaign so, it took Thomas and the team owner over a week to compromise on my bouquet. Yeah, I know. Sometimes people just get so focused on the details of a wedding that they kind of forget what it's all really about. And that's just celebrating your love with your family and your friends, right? So, we're gonna fix this. Starting with the bridesmaids dresses. Which one do you want? The original ones we chose. And I like those ones. Ok, great. Then that's what we're wearing. [sighs] Don't worry about anything, ok? That's my job. Thank you. Sorry to interrupt. Maggie, a word please? Uh, sure. Did you need help with something? You seem to get along with that reporter quite well. Uh, yeah. Yeah, well he seems nice. Yes. Yes, he is nice. He has also been assigned to cover this story every day until the wedding. Oh, uh, every day. Wow. Ok. So, we would very much appreciate it if you could sort of be his press liaison. Sorry, I don't really understand. Just keep him focused on the wedding and away from the mayor. That's not really part of my job. Isn't it? As I recall, your job is to make sure the wedding goes well for the bride and not to let any other concerns distract from her big day. I mean, I guess I could show him the ins and outs of the wedding. Perfect. That's all we're asking. Ok. Oh, and Maggie, whatever happens, just don't tell him that you're a professional bridesmaid. Of course. Great. Oh, thank you! These are gonna make the perfect centerpieces for the bridal shower. Thanks. - Hey. - Oh, hey. Thomas said you'd be coming by. Yeah, he has got me chasing a late-breaking story involving, um... Daffodils. Oh, well those are daisies, but so close. So close. Next time. Well hey, it looks like I am your new wedding liaison, whether you like it or not. Oh, I'm not complaining... about the company, at least. [clears throat] Not sure what you can teach me about weddings though. Ok wait, come here. Come here. Ok, look. These are all the different kinds of bouquets that the florist is making for weddings this week. And this is a fun fact. Did you know that the wedding bouquet dates back to ancient times when brides would carry different kinds of herbs or flowers to ward off evil spirits? Oh, just like how the bridesmaids would wear the same dress to confuse evil spirits? Huh. Yeah. Sure were a lot of evil spirits back then. But then, in the Middle Ages, the bouquet helped in different ways. See, brides were considered to be lucky, so after a wedding guests might try to rip off a piece of the bride's outfit for some good luck themselves. Well, that doesn't sound very lucky to me. Precisely, which is why a bouquet became something that a bride would toss as she made a hasty exit in all of the chaos. Oooh. Well, all these complicated rituals just to get to two simple words... I do. Well, yeah. I guess, but I don't know, I kind of think that all the rituals are what make a wedding so important, you know? It's all the ancient traditions complete with the wonderful outfits. Really, it's all about making a lifelong commitment in front of your family and your friends. Kind of like a public promise between two people to love and support each other in the good times and the bad. Can you... would you mind slowing down, 'cause this is really good stuff, I mean... Mmhmm. No, I mean, people love weddings, right? But, you know, usually for the frills and you clearly like the meaning behind things. Yeah, I do. I don't know, I mean, the way that I see it, the best moments in life. I think they come from the people that you share them with. Mmhmm. And the history before. So... I don't know. I kind of think it's all tied together somehow. Yeah, so like you don't have a story until you have the full context. Something like that. But, uh, come on. You, this is all silly to you. No, no. I never said that. Uh-huh. No, I... I believe in all those things. Um, you know, love and commitment and I just think that it's a little funny that sometimes love and commitment come down to choosing buttercream or fondue frosting. Fondue? I'm pretty sure that you meant fondant, not fondue. - Oh. - [laughs] Yeah. I'm very glad that you are not in charge of picking out the wedding cake. - Ok, ok. - Disgusting. Anyway, my point is that, um, you have given me a lot to think about. My mind is officially boggled. So... So thank you. You're welcome. [tranquil music] Girls, this is all so perfect. Yeah, thanks Shannon for treating us all to this. Oh, it's one of the perks of the job. I just have to make a post or two, #spa-life. Drink it in, ladies. Speaking of drinking it in, this wine you brought is delicious, Maisie. What is this, a Chablis? It's uh... oh, it's a secret recipe. Uh, all I know is that it's delicious. I'll get you a couple bottles. Oh, thank you. Yeah, I'd love it. But, I do need to cut out soon so Tad and I can check out a DJ for our reception. [gasps] Just wait till you see the bridesmaids dresses that Fabrizzio Lux wants to send. Trim-silk camisoles, matching column skirts. We're all sample sizes, right? But, Shannon, we already chose the bridesmaids dresses. No one says no to Fabrizzio. Uh, you know, I couldn't agree with you more. You couldn't? I did a deep dive into his work and his dresses are amazing. But, his accessories are even better. So, I had a little idea. I was thinking, since our dresses are already picked out, what if we had him handle our accessories? You know, like the best of both worlds? - Yeah. - Smart. I'll text him now. Great. [whispers] Thank you. Well, I have good news too. The perfect venue reached out with a promotion and I was able to book it for your bridal shower! Do you need any help with anything? You know, with uh, gift bags or games or, hey, what about the e-vites? I already sent them out. Oh, ok. Oh, what about the wedding website? All taken care of. But thanks, Maisie, for offering. Gotcha. I read your new piece. I loved the part where you tied the bride's wedding bouquet to the bouquets role in history. Is all that true? Yeah, 100 percent. Actually, between you and me, one of the bridesmaids took pity on me so you may have an inside source. Maybe if you ask her nicely she'll take pity on you again. And what's all that? Oh, this is my next big scoop. Stop the presses because I have been invited to help come pick up the wedding gown from the fitters. Hm. [Henry] I am going to need your help. I'm in unfamiliar territory. Oh, woah, what is all of this? Ruching, a Blouson waist. - Mmhmm. - And a surplus neckline. Wow. Someone has been doing their homework. Well, what can I say, a reporter has to know their subject. And today, the subject is... Is this. [laughs] Ok, I'm gonna teach you a couple basics that you need to know. Yeah. Starting with... styles. Oh, okay, some brides want something romantic. Uh-huh. Soft and uh, whimsical and very feminine. On you it works. Ok. Hold this. Ok, alright. And for other brides... Other brides, it is all about... oh! - The accessories. - Oh. The fancy appliqués and the beading and all the sequins. Certainly makes a statement. Yeah. A bold one. There you go. And then, other brides, they want something modern or fairy tale, or artistic. And if it was for you? For me? Which one would you chose? I would pick... Yeah. See? It's simple and elegant. ♪ Dum, dum, dum, dum... Dum, dum, dum, dum... ♪ [dramatic] No wait, no, stop the music. I can't go through with this wedding. Oh, no. But the dress is perfect! [laughs] Have you ever thought about walking down the aisle... as a bride? No comment. [chuckles] In my line of work, no comment usually means yes. Are you always so mysterious? Are you always so inquisitive? Of course. If there's something I'm interested in. Or, you know, someone, in this case. I'm sorry though, I don't... I don't mean to pry. Ok. Uh, so, David and I, we met in college. Started dating. And he always said that he was gonna propose after he finished his masters, but, uh, well the closer and closer we got to the wedding, the more distant that he got. And then eventually he told me that he wasn't sure if he was ready for that kind of commitment. Two days before the wedding I said thanks but no thanks. Yeah, I don't know. I just feel like the man I marry one day should be all in. I think you made the right decision. [chuckles] Ok, so what about you? No comment. No comment? No, no, no. A reporter has to answer questions too. Fair enough. Um, when my last relationship ended, I was busy chasing leads for this big story. It turns out the real story, um, was that she was seeing somebody else. And I... I missed it. I'm sorry. Anyway, this has been very illuminating for me. Yes. So, um, any bride who wades through thousands of options without losing her mind deserves a medal. Yeah. Mmhmm. I think, I have my next story, actually. - Oh? - Thanks to you. Well, no problem. - One last follow-up question. - Mmhmm. Do you have time to grab a drink or something? Just professionally, of course. Just to say thanks for all your help. I so want to. I really, really do, but I'm supposed to be getting everything together for the bridal shower and picking up wine and all that kind of stuff. Pretty partial to a good Shiraz. You? No, I'm more of a Syrah person myself. Syrah and Shiraz are the same grape. Yeah. I was just kidding. Ok. - It's like que Syrah, Shiraz. - Here's the dress, thank you. - You're welcome. - Thanks. Ok, bye, Henry. [Maggie] Bye. Maggie! Oh! Just a heads up, since the wedding will be held on the mansion grounds, for security purposed we'll be doing a little walk-through here tomorrow morning with Nora, the wedding planner. Yeah, ok, great. I will be here. Meanwhile, I've been receiving quite a few calls from guests asking about the location of the bridal shower. Now, isn't this something you should be handling instead of me? Yes. Ok, well, technically, since Chloe is the Maid of Honor, she is the one in charge. But, between you and me, I helped her secure a great location but she assures me that she has the rest totally under control. Please see that she does. Will do. Thank you, Maggie. Thank you, Thomas. So the caterers are confirmed and the carpenters will assemble the arbor on Friday and... Ok, Maggie. What's going on? Hm? Oh, no, it's nothing. Come on, when you invited me to dinner I knew something was up. Spill. Ok. So, Alexis wants to get closer to Chloe but she doesn't want me stepping on Chloe's toes with the planning. But, the bridal shower is in only two days and there is still so much left to do. So, I have to make sure that the shower goes off without a hitch while somehow doing it all on the sly. I don't know. This is not like you, Maggie. You never get flustered. Maybe I'm losing my touch. Is there something else going on? Ok, well, Thomas is using me to distract that reporter, Henry, from cornering the mayor for some kind of interview. They asked you to do that? Yeah. Ok, and that's not the worst part. The worst part is that Henry is... he's really nice. I haven't connected with anyone in a really long time and I can't even tell him the truth. And I know that working under cover and all that is part of the job, but this is the first time I feel really bad about misleading somebody. I'm sorry, Maggie. If you tell him the truth, it'll be a PR nightmare. Yeah. I know, I know. Just hang in there. Deliver on this wedding and then you'll get your recommendation from the mayor. You're right. I just have to keep a professional distance. I just hate having to hide who I really am. [typing] Hi, uh, Luanne's Gifts? I was calling to confirm the goodie bags for the Shepard shower tomorrow? Oh, no, not a baby shower. This is definitely a bridal shower. Yes, I am sure. Bridal shower, not baby shower. And actually, while I have you, can you confirm the quantity that was ordered? Oh, yeah, that should actually be three dozen. Not 360. Just probably a little typo. Can you make that correction and just reimburse the card on file? That would be great. Ok, thanks so much. Bye. Someone's busy. Oh, yeah, tell me about it. I feel like I am going a little crazy trying to keep everything on track for the shower. Some of the things were never done. You know, actually, it looks like Chloe never put the address for the shower onto the wedding website. So, gotta fix that too. But, actually, we gotta go to your presentation. So, let's go. So, I'll create an aisle here lined elegantly with chairs on each side for the ceremony. Then after the ceremony, we'll transform the space with lighting, romantic decor, then your guests can head over to the gorgeous tent for dinner and dancing. - That sounds perfect. - Mmhmm. Great! Are we still at 100 guests? We're currently at 150. We have to make sure that all of the mayor's top supporters are invited. Yes, can't forget them. Thomas, can I have a look at that list? Yes, I suppose. Hey, don't worry, honey. I'll go talk it through with him, okay? Thank you. Hey. Are you, are you ok? Yeah. I'm just thinking about my mom. How is everything going with the shower? I'm on it. Could you confirm with Chloe that Darlene is coming, please? Yes, I already did, but I will double-check for you. - Thank you. - Yeah. Hey, Thomas, sorry, just wanted to catch up before you ran off. Um, what is happening with the one-on-one I requested with the mayor? The mayor is extremely busy. Yeah, you mentioned that, it's just that the public trail is so important and I really think the voters deserve to know where the mayor stands. Yes, well I'll be sure to pass that along. But let me just remind you why you're here, though. Oh, never mind. There he is. - Maisie? - Yeah. Your help would be appreciated. Thank you. Oh, oh... Henry! Henry! Henry, hey! - Hi. - Hi. Do you want to share a ride to the dance lesson? Um... Sure. - Great. - Great. - Hello. - Hi. [clapping] Partner up, everyone. It's time for our dance lesson. No one wants a wedding party who doesn't know how to dance. Today, I'll be teaching you the basic steps for a few different styles of dance. I think we'll begin with a waltz which of course is a much more romantic style of dance. Perfect for a wedding. Ok. Partner up, please. Looks like we are just one guy short, so... Best man's caught in traffic. Well, I see a warm body. - Are you-me? - Uh-huh. Oh, no. I'm just here to cover the story. Well, you can cover it from the dance floor. Yes, but then that would make me part of the story. Which is crossing a journalistic red line. A gentleman does not leave a young lady waiting. Now! Dance! Sorry, about this. Don't be sorry. I mean, it could be fun. Yeah. [Nadine] Everyone follow along. Um, ok. I'm just gonna show you a basic waltz step, I guess. Ok, so, give me your hand. Ok. And put this one on my back. Ok. So, just follow me. So we're gonna go back, and to the side, now back to you, and now this way. Yeah. Like that. Uh, this seems kind of hard. You got it. Ok, so maybe, um, something like this? Ok. You know how to dance? Explain, please. My parents are dance instructors, so I took my first steps on a dance floor. You are just full of surprises. And you are full of mystery. Yeah, dancing is like the one thing at a wedding I can pull off. By the way, I know what you're up to. You do? You've clearly been asked to keep me away from the mayor. Uh... Right? I'm sorry about that, I just... It's kind of a long story and I'm stuck in the middle. That's alright. I'm used to dancing around obstacles. Oh. I'll corner the mayor eventually. Ok, so, uh, what exactly did you want to talk to him about anyway? Heard you mention Evergreen Park? Yeah. There's a proposal to build condos right in the middle of it. Can they do that? They can if they have approval. - But enough about work. - Yeah. Although I haven't had a chance to write about the most interesting part of the wedding. What's that? You. - Me? - Yeah. Really? You know, getting a bridesmaid's perspective on things. Oh. Yeah. You know, it could be a good story. Yeah. So... how about dinner later? Need to keep tabs on me, right? You'll know exactly where I am. Ok, this is just dinner, right? Mmhmm. And not a date? - Oh, no. - Mmhmm. - Just asking you questions. - Mmhmm. And I will just answer them. So, I guess, we can do that. Oh, good. Good. [classical music] [laughing] That was just... Uh, no. I liked Alexis from the minute that we met. We just, we clicked. I really am so happy for her and Dylan. So, we've established that you love weddings. Mmhmm. But is there a specific part that stands out? A wedding is such a life-changing experience. It's like a day when everything just feels right in the world. Right. Ok, um, I think I sound obsessed. I'm sorry. No. Well, yes, but it's endearing. [laughing] Ok. So, where do you think this obsession comes from? Uh, yeah, I think it came from my dad. He was a justice of the peace. I spent a lot of my weekends with him, helping him out. So, yeah, I kind of found my joy at weddings. Mmhmm. You still do? I mean, look, what you do for a living. What... What do you mean? You're a wine distributor. You must go to weddings all the time. Yeah. Sorry, I mean yeah. I like to peak in on the weddings of some of my clients. So, what about you? How did you get into journalism? Um, you know, I've just always loved reporting. You know, working my sources and digging up the facts. You know, I'm gonna take my reporter hat off now, though, because I am at a beautiful restaurant with a beautiful woman. Well, so, do you still think that weddings are a big ol' waste of time? You know what? Thanks to you, maybe I'm starting to see them in a new light. What? Oh, hey, fun fact. Did you know that merlot means young blackbird in French? - I did not. - Mmhmm. - That is fun. - Mmhmm. But this is Chianti. Hey. Still trying to find the perfect dress for the shower? Well, with everyone making all the other wedding choices, this is one of the few choices I can make on my own. - One problem. - Hm? I can't decide. Is this too long? Uh, no. No, I personally love tea length. But the one with the sleeves? That's nice too. I don't know. Hey, what if I told you that I have one more option to show you? Hold on. You want to try on one more dress? - That's my mom's. - Mmhmm. Where did you find it? The truth is, I could not stop thinking about that photo of your mom you showed me in the living room. Where your dad was sworn in as mayor. Just something about your mom in this dress was really special. So, I asked your dad and he pointed me to the attic and, I don't know, I just thought it was worth a shot. I always loved this dress. So, do you think you found the perfect dress for the shower now? - I think so. - Yay! Oh, and Darlene, she's gonna be at the shower? Yes. Yeah, I peaked at Chloe's list at the dance rehearsal and she definitely rsvp'd. Ok. So Darlene's pretty important to you, huh? She was there for me when my mom was sick. I want her at the bridal shower so that she knows how important she still is to me. [Chloe] Who's ready for their bridal shower? - Yes! - Ok. Oh, nice. Um, Chloe? Chloe, can I talk to you one second? Um, this isn't really the venue for the bridal shower. Of course it is. I booked it myself. No, no, sorry, the shower is at the Arbor Club. Oh, the Arbor Club. They called me with an offer. Yeah, exactly. But I already booked this place, so. [phone vibrating] This phone keep buzzing. Uh... Why am I getting texts that there are guests waiting at the Arbor Club? Ok, um this is all my fault. I put the wrong address on the wedding website. Why would you do that? Do you know what? I will fix everything. You just take Alexis upstairs, ok? Honestly, Maisie. Ok. Um... Um... Hi. Uh, you wouldn't happen to have a shuttle van, would you? Maisie, there you are. You've been gone for 20 minutes. Is everything ok? Yeah, no, just a small hiccup that should be solved shortly. But, uh... wow. Look at the amazing job that Chloe did in here. I was just saying that everything looks so beautiful and... intimate. Oh, well you know some of the guests they got held up but they should be here in no time. I don't see Darlene, is she one of the guests that got held up? Uh, well Darlene rsvp'd so she should be here soon. But, you know, for now I just need you to stay in the moment because otherwise your shower will be over and you'll have missed the whole thing, right? You're right. I should just pull myself together. - Classic picture! - Oh, go ahead. You guys are so cute. Is that dress vintage, Lex? Yes. Yes. - Oh! - Hey. - Hi! - Fancy seeing you here. Yeah. Is everything ok? Yes. Yes. No, I'm just so surprised to see you at a bridal shower. Really thought that's where you would draw the line. Oh, there is no line anymore. I guess I'm caught up in the story. Oh. Oh, my editor wants me to take some pics this time, so. Oh. Mind if I snap a few of you? Of me? Oh, I mean, surely you could use any of the other bridesmaids here. Why would I do that? I don't know if I want to be in the article. Please. Ok. Ok, fine. Yeah, sure. Ok. Oh. Oh, what? Oh, no something in my teeth? You're making the flowers look bad. - Ok, go do your job! - You do your job. What, my, job? You're a bridesmaid. Your job is to have fun. That's right. Have fun. - I am having fun. - Good. Yes. Oh, hi. Ok, thank goodness you guys are here. Um, here, come and sit over here. Welcome to the bridal shower. Yes! See. - I still don't see Darlene. - Oh. Lunch is about to be served and I was going to do my speech. Oh. What's wrong? Darlene, her mom's friend, still isn't here. Oh, but Darlene is here. She is? That's Darlene right there. No, that's Darlene Hastings. She works with my dad. My mom's friend is Darlene Hughes. Oh. Their names are so close. Wait, does this mean that Darlene Hughes wasn't invited to the shower at all? I must have confused the two Darlenes and left one off when I sent out the e-vites. And that means when I double-checked your list I must have thought that Darlene was invited. It's no one's fault. We all know whose fault it is, it's mine. No, no, Alexis. I am so sorry. No, I just, um... I think I need some air. Um... Maisie, is there anything I can do to help? Henry, I'm so sorry. I have to go. My friends and associates sent to the wrong location? We hired you to make sure this exact sort of thing didn't happen. I'm so sorry for letting you down. It's not about letting me down, you let Alexis down. She was heartbroken that Darlene wasn't there. You should have headed this off. I understand if you want to terminate our agreement. That's not gonna happen. Lex? It might be best if we... Best for who, Dad? Maggie's job is supporting me, not managing optics. - Alexis, it's ok... - No. Chloe resisted you every step of the way. And, being forced to keep tabs on Henry couldn't have helped. I simply suggested that she combine her current duties with a little PR. I have given in on every decision on this wedding. My wedding. But I'm not budging on this. Maggie stays. Well, I guess we've been told. Maisie? Maisie. - Oh, hey. - Hey. Hi. Wait, what are you doing here? You don't really look like you're dressed for a hike. Oh right, yeah, no. I was hoping I would run into you. Really? - Yeah. - Oh. Remember when we first met, you said you came out here to de-stress? Mmhmm. Well, yesterday you seemed stressed. So, sorry we didn't get to talk more then. No, I'm sorry. I just was feeling really bad that I let Alexis down is all. Well, I mean, you're just one bridesmaid. You can't take responsibility for everything that happens. I don't know about that. I mean, Alexis is a friend now. Now? No, I mean, she's always been a friend. Right. I just wish that the shower had gone more smoothly is all. But hey, I read your article on it and it was really nice. - Oh? - Yeah. You really wrote from the heart on that one. Well, I had a lot of help. So, my next article is gonna be on this place. Well, the development plans for it, at least. It's great that you're bringing public awareness to it. I have only been in town for a little bit and I already love it here. It seems like a lot of people love this trail too, so. Yeah, still need the mayor to weigh in though. And of course he's avoiding me. Well, I mean, pressuring at home doesn't seem to be working, so maybe you just have to wait until after the wedding. Yeah, or after the election. Yeah. Maybe, yeah. Hey, what's up? What is it? You don't have to hide anything from me. No, I just don't always know what I'm aloud to say to you. You know, as your press contact and all - Yeah. - Yeah. Well, you won't always be my press contact. Right? [both laugh] Do you want to go on a date? Hm? After the wedding? Like a date date? Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, I would really like to. Yeah. I mean, if you still want to, by then. Well, why wouldn't I? No reason. Ok. [phone chimes] Oh, uh, hold on. Sorry, one second. Oh. Something important? Um, actually yeah. I'm sorry, I have to go. - Ok. - Ok. - Ok, bye. - Bye. ♪ Maisie, thanks for coming so quickly. Hey. I hope you don't mind. I was getting my fitting done. Is everything ok? Not really. Um, this morning I saw a big refund on my credit card from the gift bag vendor. When I called to see if it was an error, they told me what you did. Yeah, no, um... look, I'm really sorry about that. I should have, I should have talked to you... Don't be. You fixed my mistake. Just one, in a long line. I hadn't even remembered to put vegan options on the menu until lunch was being served. And I'm vegan! Maybe if I had started sooner I wouldn't have gotten so overwhelmed, but... you helped me. I'm not sure how helpful I was by sending half the guests to the wrong shower location, but... Which you fixed. I mean it, Maisie, thank you. You're welcome. [teary] I can't stop thinking about Alexis' face when Darlene didn't show up. I let Alexis down in a big way... once again. What do you mean, "once again"? The summer Aunt Carol was sick, I was off on my travels. I didn't come back to help. You were doing your own thing, you know. I'm sure that Alexis understands that. Alexis wedding, I thought this was my chance to prove I could be there for her. I think I understand why you wanted to be Maid of Honor so much. I just wish I could make it up to Alexis like when we were little. Why? What did you guys do? Aunt Carol had this rule for Alexis and me when we were growing up. If we had a tiff playing together, whoever made the other one mad had to throw a tea party in the backyard. [laughs] Hey, that's what we're gonna do. Throw a tea party in the backyard? I have an idea. So, have a look at the new itinerary, basically everything's been pushed by about an hour. Got it, thank you Thomas. Oh, yeah, that looks great. Thanks. Mayor Shepard? Mr. Whittington. Caught me off guard. I apologize. I'm late for a meeting, can't talk. Got it. I'm doing a story on the complex at Evergreen Park. Voters have a right to know whether you're in favor of rezoning to make way for condos. Actually, it may surprise you but I am more focusing on my daughter's wedding right now. I understand that, but this is an important issue that voters might want to know about. No comment. I just don't think her end should be... Oh. Yeah, no. Oh, Dad. Hey, hun. Did you want to look at the seating chart? Oh, I'm sure it's gonna be great. Uh, has Henry been asking you about Evergreen Park? Uh, he mentioned the rezoning. But he's been really focused on the wedding. Anyway we can limit his access moving forward? He's been covering the wedding just as you requested. I'm afraid she's right, sir. Cutting him off now might stir up more trouble and lead to even more reporters and more questions. So, we're stuck with him. It would seem so. Oh, that's just great. No bad press. Ok. [Alexis] What are we doing here, of all places? It's a surprise. Just trust me. - And Chloe's here? - Mmhmm. I think that she has something that she wants to tell you. What is this place? Everything looks amazing. Does this remind you of anything? Like, when we were little and one of us made a mistake. Our backyard tea parties? It's the least I could do, Lexi. Chloe, it's ok. No, it's not. I let you down and not just at the shower. The summer I went abroad while your mom was sick... I should have been there for you. Oh. I should have tried harder, these past few weeks. Maisie tried to help me every step of the way, I just was too blind and too stubborn to listen. But, I finally wised up and I let her help on a little surprise. Oh, my goodness. Darlene! I wouldn't have missed this for the world. This is just the best surprise ever. Oh. Do you know what it means, that you did this? No. I just cashed in a couple miles and flew her in on a red eye. No big deal. Really. It means that you can do anything. Including stepping into the spotlight and letting yourself be seen. Thank you. Ok, come on. Ok. I am going to... oh, uh... I'll be right back. - Ok. - On second. Well, well. [clinking tea cups] Didn't think that you were a fan of afternoon tea. Oh, you know I'm doing a listicle. - Hm. - Yeah. What brings you here? Oh, just uh meeting up with a couple friends. [laughing] Sounds like things are going well. Um, look Henry, I have to... I have to tell you something. Ok, sure. Actually, I guess it's more like I need to confess something. This sounds serious. Yeah, it kind of is. Maisie! Alright, we have to take a photo of all of us together. You have to be in it. Wait, wait, wait. What were you going to tell me? Um, just that I... Maisie! I better go. Okay. Bye. Good luck with your listicle. [jazz music playing] I'd say this assignment has been a total success. The professional bridesmaid does it again. Ah. The call of the kitchen. I'm proud of you. [jazz music playing] I'm not here to talk politics. Neither am I. I promise. I just wanted to say one thing. Only one. [laughs] Yes. I wanted to apologize for the gotcha moment outside your office the other day. You might be the first journalist who's ever apologized for anything. We're not known for our humility. I could say the same thing about politicians. Right. Why don't you call the office and set up an appointment to chat. As much as it pains me, you're right. The voters do need to know where I stand on Evergreen Park. Preserving green spaces in urban areas is a high priority of mine. Really? Absolutely. Thank you, Mr. Mayor. Of course. ♪ Call it kismet or karma or pure luck. Whatever the reason, I am incredible grateful that Alexis and Dylan have found each other and I just can't wait to see them get married tomorrow. [crowd murmuring] And uh, if Alexis's mother, Carol, were here, she would be.. She'd be smiling too. And, I know that she'd say, heaven honey, don't hold this up with one of your long speeches. So, um, here's to Alexis and Dylan and a wonderful life together. To Alexis and Dylan! [guests] To Alexis and Dylan! - Thank you, Dad. - I'm so proud of you, honey. Hi. Well, that was a wonderful speech, Mr. Mayor. It's just hard to believe the wedding's tomorrow. Oh. How's our girl doing? You know, she's in... she's in really high spirits. You deserve a lot of credit for that. You have helped Alexis enormously. Thank you. That really means a lot to me. [laughs] A professional bridesmaid... I mean, it might be one of the odder careers I've run across, but you are worth every penny and more, Maggie. I'm pretty sure you mean Maisie. [Mayor] Yes, yeah, well not for much longer though, right? Maisie? I'm more of a Syrah person, myself. Syrah and Shiraz are the same grape. Oh, and uh, Emma Spencer from Midwestern Savings is here tonight and I will introduce you later as promised. Oh, yes. Thank you. Thanks. Maggie. Uh, yeah. Oh, sorry, I thought that you said Maisie. No. No, you didn't, Maggie. I don't have to be a reporter to know when I'm not being told the truth. I um... Uh... Follow me. Come here. I'm so sorry, sorry. I kept seeing red flags and I just kept ignoring them 'cause I guess I wanted to trust you. Please can you just let me explain? I don't understand, why could you not just tell me the truth? I'm sorry that I didn't just tell you the truth, ok? But my job requires me to be anonymous. I help brides get through their big day with the least amount of stress possible. Well, you've kept me from the real story. You kept me from who you really are. Ok, but I promise that I was going to tell you the truth. As soon as the wedding was over. Everything that I feel for you, Henry, it's all real. Look, I have to ask you, are you planning on putting any of this in the article now that you know the truth? Because you really can't do that, please. Did you really ask me that? Am I just some tabloid reporter to you? No, no, Henry, no. Come on, please, you know me better than that. I thought I did. [sorrowful music] Henry, please. [Kay] What's with the text you sent? Yeah, Kay, hate to ask but can someone else cover the wedding today, cause I want to focus completely on the Evergreen Park story. Tell me why you want off the wedding. Uh, let's just say I got taken in by a source Hm. And I fell into a journalist's biggest no-no, which I became part of the story. You wrote a lot about a certain Maisie, your inside source. Thought you didn't have a nose for news. Well, Henry, I might not be an investigative reporter, but I am a woman. And it seems like this "source" means a lot to you. Uh... What if she wasn't telling me the whole story? What's your heart telling you? Are you ok? No, not really. Don't be so hard on yourself. Yeah, kind of tough not to be. I really like Henry. I was so close to the finish line, too. And you're positive Henry won't share this big scoop with the world? I mean, he was so hurt that I even asked. You had to ask, sweetie. This is your career we're talking about. But now Henry thinks I'm an imposter, so, uh, yeah, that's that. Hey, listen. You are the most authentic person I've ever met. And if Henry can't see that, that's his problem. Is it? 'Cause it kind of feels like mine. Ok. Be honest. Do I look ok? You look beyond beautiful. [clears throat] You look incredible, sweetheart.
