Yes, we call it the Inugami Mansion Old Mr. Inugami died 7 months ago There was a grand funeral After all, everyone around here depended on Inugami Pharmaceuticals That lady in the boat Is she a member of the family?

No He's a key suspect He claims to be a detective Is that right? I think so I contacted my associates in Tokyo to verify his identify They said he's very reliable Wakabayashi hired you? In addition to the letter He also sent me this book He mentioned that something awful will happen to the Inugami family Say, even if something will happen... How did he know? He seemed to believe in it It appears that way What? Sahei Inugami's will is locked up in the safe at the office I think someone read it You think it's Wakabayashi? We're the only ones with access Result of the autopsy shows poison in his lungs About the will... Anything suspicious? Probably Why did Wakabayashi read the will? Mr. Kindaichi Just like Wakabayashi I need your help in this matter Really? You saved my life! Now that Wakabayashi is dead I was worried about paying for the inn Why didn't you read the will? The will involves 9 people They must all be present Who's not here? There's someone with no blood relation Someone Sahei Inugami was very fond of Miss Tamayo Nonomiya Who's missing? Sukekiyo, the only son of his eldest daughter Matsuko Sukekiyo enlisted in the army After the war He wrote a letter home But he never came back About 2 weeks ago He returned to Hakata suddenly Madam Matsuko left to meet him Other than Madam Matsuko How many children did Master Sahei have? He was never legally married He had 3 daughters of different mothers Matsuko is the eldest Takeko is the second daughter who lives in Tokyo Her husband Toranosuke is the branch manager in Tokyo They have a son, Suketake and a daughter, Sayoko Mother, that's Aunt Matsuko's koto You're playing it without her permission She'll be upset! Where is she? She said Sukekiyo has left the army and wanted us here She sent a telegram from Hakata And told us to come as soon as possible But she's not here herself! It has been 15 days She always does as she pleases Did something happen? Sayoko - Grandpa... - What about him? His will is all that matters I'll wait as long it takes Hey, Suketake This is not good I thought it'll only take a few days I didn't expect it to drag on like this There's food shortage in Tokyo You're better off here Right, Father? You're back! What took you so long, Koukichi? I'm back! You're late! Checking up on Headquarters? Stop imagining things Umeko is the youngest daughter Her husband Koukichi is the branch manager in Kobe Suketomo is their only son You're late, Father! How are things with Sayoko? I'm only doing this for you Don't talk nonsense! I'm with Sayoko She'll get her share for sure Along with our share It'll be a huge sum Right? Phone call for you, Madam Umeko Really? I see Here's Umeko That was Matsuko Is she back? Always the big sister Such perfect timing Takeko, Umeko Just the 2 of you? Yes, we did what you asked! Something the matter? Who's this? This is Sukekiyo Mr. Kindaichi It's you! You're all dressed up, where are you off to? The will is inside I'm off to the Inugami residence They're all here? Yes, came back last night Please come with me, Mr. Kindaichi Me? I told them you'll replace Wakabayashi They reluctantly agreed I'm so nervous I'm shaking Sorry to keep you waiting This is Mr. Yokomizo Kindaichi Last will of Testament I'm prepared to read you the will But before that I have a request for Madam Matsuko This gentleman... is he really Mr. Sukekiyo? Not that I doubt your word But his face... What are you saying? Are you implying someone is posing as Sukekiyo? No, that's not what I mean What does everyone else think? Should I proceed? No Umeko - Yes? What do you think? At least have him remove the mask and let us see his face Naturally Take off your mask, Sukekiyo When he was in the army He was severely disfigured That's why he wears a mask We were detained because we had this mask custom-made in Tokyo Do it for these heartless people Remove your mask! That will do, Sukekiyo Mr. Furutachi Are you satisfied? I'm sure he's Sukekiyo You have my word as his mother Hurry and read the will I understand I shall begin The symbols of the entire Inugami estate The Axe, the Koto and Chrysanthemum are entailed, under the following conditions to Tamayo Nonomiya What? To Tamayo? Regarding her spouse She must choose from Mr. Sahei Inugami 3 grandsons Sukekiyo, Suketake and Suketomo She has the right to choose her husband If she chooses not to marry any of the grandsons and marry someone else She'll lose her entire inheritance In the event, none of the grandsons wishes to marry Tamayo or at the time of death They will lose their inheritance Tamayo may choose to marry anyone she so desires In the event Tamayo loses her inheritance or at the time of death The grandsons will, in proper order inherit the Inugami estate which will be equally divided into 5 shares Sukekiyo, Suketake and Suketomo will each inherit 1 share The remaining 2 shares will be given to Kikuno Seisyo's son Sizuma Kikuno Seisyo? In the event Tamayo Sukekiyo, Suketake and Suketomo are dead The entire Inugami estate will go to Sizuma Sesiyo In the event Sizuma Sesiyo cannot be located Or if his death is confirmed At the time all other successors are dead The entire business and estate will be handled by the Inugami Foundation This is a lie! A fake! Someone is trying to steal the estate This is not a fake I have verified it as a lawyer This cannot be real! The will is legally binding We must act accordingly What about us? We're his daughters! What kind of will is this? How dare you call yourself a lawyer? This girl with no blood relations cannot possibly inherit everything We waited so long for something so absurd! How can we face Tamayo? I can't believe this is happening! This is outrageous! Hey! Not only Tamayo Seisyo and her son got a big share too Shut up! Don't bring that up! We have absolutely nothing to do with them He left me out of the will! You're not the only one What about me? Don't get too excited! Can you calm down? We must stay calm If Suketake marries Tamayo We'll inherit everything I'm not reconciled to that Don't cry, Sayoko Takeko, according to Koukichi's calculations If Tamayo loses the inheritance Suketomo's share of the estate amounts to almost 550 million! Even though one fifth sounds absurd It's enough to buy you 5 or 6 high-rises on the busiest street in Kobe You're too naive Everything is likely to go to Tamayo I want to know Why is Sizuma Seisyo entitled to anything? Exactly! Mr. Furutachi is right The will is legally binding When Father was around 50 That maid Seisyo bore him a bastard son I can't stand to let her inherit anything Don't mind Seisyo What about our mothers? That's right! If Sizuma is still alive How old is he? Same age as Sukekiyo We must curse Tamayo and Sizuma That's too dangerous I've been driving for 14 years No, I mean Miss Tamayo To the members of the Inugami family She's a thorn in their flesh As long as she's alive She decides who gets what You mean someone wants to kill her? Or the contrary Contrary? If she hates them all And is in love with someone else And she doesn't want to lose the inheritance Killing them is the only solution I heard she had several accidents Yesterday's boat incident was the 3rd one Yes The killer posing as the victim is a very common thing People in your line of work are always so suspicious? Human beings can't be so cold-blooded... No But someone has become just that Don't forget Mr. Wakabayahsi is murdered Mr. Furutachi Did Mr. Wakabayashi love anyone? Come to think of it He's secretly in love with Miss Tamayo Miss Tamayo? Before they go off to war People would come here and leave their hand prints and pray for good luck Why are we doing this? This can prove whether that stranger is Sukekiyo Different people have different hand prints I intend to check that man's print against this one Be our witness, Mr. Furutachi To confirm Sukekiyo's print That's why we invited you here You're saying you don't think that's Sukekiyo? Naturally But Madam Matsuko was so certain You don't understand her If Sukekiyo is dead She'll have nothing Did you think of this? No, the Head of the shrine did and contacted us How thoughtful! I had actually forgotten about this Someone else reminded me Sukekiyo left his print before his enlistment Who was that? Miss Tamayo Excuse me... Remember this watch? It was broken You fixed it for me It broke down again during the war Since you were the only who can fix it I have been waiting for you Can you help me? Who is it? It's open Do you have a room? Aunt Matsuko You object to Sukekiyo making a print? How many times must I tell you? Even if he's disfigured He is definitely Sukekiyo But... All the more reason to let him do it and put our minds to rest What do you think, Umeko? I agree If you refuse you'll arouse even more suspicion! Sukekiyo Your mother may object But this matters concerns you Will you do it? Sukekiyo is the most legitimate heir In the olden days He's the crown prince, your master Now you're treating him like a criminal I will never let him do something so ridiculous even if he wants to Let's go, Sukekiyo Hey! Don't run away! Please fill in your name and address Do it for me Me? I told you I can't do that All guests must do it themselves This is the law since the Tenpo days Or perhaps from further back The Tax department is very strict after the war I must go by the book Can't you do it for me? I can't write! If he refuses that means he's an impostor Don't scare me! It fell out when I opened the door You gave me such a scare! How is it possible he can't write? I left the log book with him He's weird Maybe there's a scar on his face He never took off the scarf Did he pay? That's suspicious! You going out? It's late, where are you going? Going out Come over at once Wakabayashi was right! Something happened! You can't go in! Mr. Kindaichi Mr. Furutachi, what happened? Please come this way Enzo made the chrysanthemum mannequins It was Master Sahei's hobby Enzo makes it every year It's from the puppet play The chrysanthemum field in the 3rd act Can you tell, Mr. Kindaichi? They resemble the family members That's a human head... Is that Suketake? Who discovered him? Enzo Enzo? Calm down, Takeko Don't be like this, Mother Don't... I have to go see Suketake - Don't be ridiculous! - Mother! I want revenge! I want to kill the killer! No wonder Takeko has gone mad Why put the head here? That's a lot of work! The Police needs the living room This is so disturbing! Suketake met with such a brutal death Everyone is at a loss I forgot to tell you something What is it? The young man with the mask We can't confirm if he's Sukekiyo You mean comparing the prints? Suketake suggested it Matsuko was furious And they started arguing If that Sukekiyo is an impostor He's afraid Suketake will suspect him Am I right, Commissioner? The thought of it scares me I didn't want to bring it up But it's best you know about it Inoue! Thanks for your help! You may go A family feud! She's just a nag, nothing else The scene of the crime should be the terrace We assume the killer chopped off Suketake's head and threw the body into the lake We must retrieve the body That's easy for you to say Algae from the bottom of the lake are entangling like a woman's hair You won't find anything Oh, right... Mr. Furutachi Suketake and Wakabayashi's deaths are related to the will We must know its content Please hand it over as part of the evidence Alright? Forensics? How many are here? I found this on the floor You recognize this brooch? Yes Whose is it? I think it's Miss Tamayo's Miss Tamayo? Maybe she dropped it before last night? When we discussed the prints last night She was still wearing it I remember that clearly - Madam Mastuko needs me? - Yes About the prints She has agreed to let Sukekiyo do it We want you there as a witness She was against it yesterday! How strange! Everyone is here Sukekiyo will make a print You'll all be his witness Last time I found the idea absurd So I was dead set against it But Suketake has been murdered And people suspect Sukekiyo and I killed him Who would do such a thing? They may not speak it But the thought has crossed their minds That's why Sukekiyo volunteered to do this That will do, Madam Matsuko I'll pass it to the Police for verification Is this your brooch? Yes! Where did you find it? At the scene of the crime I... I asked you here Sorry I'm late You never asked for me I'm a bit surprised This watch has Sukekiyo's finger prints Compare this with the hand print I didn't expect you to help us I just want to clear things up as soon as possible I'm sorry to bother you But you can use the finger prints I'll get on it tomorrow You don't think that man is Sukekiyo? Good night Miss Tamayo Can we talk? There's nothing to talk about Among the 3 of us Who will you choose? I've always liked you Not because of the inheritance I haven't decided, goodbye! - Miss Tamayo! - Don't! You'll be mine... If you do that again, I'll kill you I was terrified Enzo escorted me from the terrace Is that it? Yes Did you call the Police? Yes The body was moved to Guanyin Cape in a boat that belongs to the family We found the tools used to cut off the head The boat bears the Inugami symbol Enzo is in charge of the boat house When he was questioned He didn't mention any missing boats This should be the key to the boat house He discovered the human head He was also the last one to see Suketake alive Tamayo's statement was ambiguous And there were no witnesses What's their relationship? The late Master Sahei brought him home 10 years ago He was enlisted in the war Nobody knows his background Master Sahei ordered him to guard Tamayo with his life This is what Enzo told the other servants If Tamayo asks him he'll kill for her Tamayo and Enzo... I get it They're the killers Follow them - Yes Mr. Furutachi Any word on the hand prints? I'm still waiting There's something else, Commissioner Innkeeper - Here? - Yes When did the masked man leave? Around 5 o'clock Show me the guest log - The log! - Yes! What is this? - Sanpei Yamada? - Yes This handwriting is awful He didn't write it - Did you? - No My wife did Hello! What are you doing here? We must think alike The blood stained boat was abandoned at the Cape I came to check the neighborhood And I found this inn Sorry to interrupt Do you still need me? No - Right! If there was a man in army uniform The investigation may take a different turn I thought the case was related to the will The killer must be from within the family Now it can be an outsider The veteran was at the inn between 8 to 10pm last night During that time the Inugami family was busy with the prints Looks like there are 2 masked men 2? Sorry to keep you waiting This is Mr. Fujisaki from Forensics We have the results Please begin, Mr. Fujisaki I'm here to disclose the results I'll omit the technical terms and get to the point These 2 prints are identical Therefore, this gentleman is without a doubt, Mr. Sukekiyo This is solid proof Did you hear that? Any more questions? I don't think so That is to say You acknowledge he's Sukekiyo Mr. Furutachi and this gentleman Thank you for your help This is rationed Thank you You like to smoke? Yes What about Madam Matsuko and Takeko? They all do, why? Nothing Something's wrong with Mother You're all tired We only keep vigil till midnight Please get some rest Let's go Sure A word with you, Miss Tamayo? Want some tea? I prefer something sweet Let's talk in my room No, we'll do it here What is it you wish to say? About my brother I heard he saw you before he was killed What did you talk about? I told the Police everything I don't care about my brother I don't want you to choose Suketomo Now there are only 2 candidates One has a face too ugly to look at Naturally I'm worried I'm pregnant Really? With Suketomo's child Listen to me If you choose Suketomo I'll hate you forever What is it? I saw someone He jumped from the balcony Maybe it's a thief What was that? It's Sukekiyo - Is he dead? - May I? Is he dead? No, he's unconscious Someone knocked him out The estimated time of death is between 11 pm and midnight The cause of death is a fatal wound into the chest from the back What about the murder weapon? Something sharp like scissors Scissors? The kind with a heavy handle like shears Only women use shears Find the owner The killer used the shears to kill And chopped off the head with an axe The killer must have prepared both weapons I think 2 people used different weapons There are 2 killers? Just an assumption By the way Did you find the watch on the body? No, although Tamayo said she gave it to Suketake It must be a lie A pretty girl like that won't lie People are either good or bad I thought we agreed You're not to come here again Yet you called I'm so sorry... The family has become the center of attention You must have heard Must be tough on you! Then you should leave me alone I heard Takeko and Umeko are still supporting their mothers That's their business Take this and leave I'll do as you say I'm afraid This is the last time we'll see each other Take care "Inugami family" Are you finished? Yes, it was delicious I made them myself What's the best? Raw eggs! That's too much! "The Sahei Inugami Story" After the Sino-Japanese and Russo-Japanese wars as well as the World War I Inugami Pharmaceuticals had exceptional growth I want to know the secret Is it related to the case? Probably Mr. Furutachi The secret of "The Sahei Inugami Story" What's the secret? I'm not too sure I don't want to bring it up Do you want more victims? There'll be more killings? Hard to say But very likely Poppy? The foundation of Inugami Pharmaceuticals is this special root mixed with other drugs Sahei Inugami was familiar with poppy Perhaps that was before he came here and started the family He founded the company at age of 23 He planted poppy at the beginning You should know You can extract drugs from poppy Like opium, morphine and heroin It's illegal to grow poppy Sahei Inugami used his connections and got permission to purchase huge quantities of these drugs For our military Inugami drugs were as effective as bombs and firearms on the battlefront That was most unfortunate Wars are brutal! There you are! I've been looking for you Something the matter? Kindaichi is here with the Commissioner It appears to be something important We're to meet in the living room Come! Really? Alright! Who is it? Speak up! Who's there? Help! Shears? Yes According to the servants You have borrowed Madam Takeko's shears Can I take a look? Yes... Well? I wanted to put flowers in Suketake's memorial hall But I couldn't find it It was there then? The day Suketake was killed What happened to the shears? We have confirmed A pair of shears killed Suketake You think I'm the killer? That's unforgivable! Please calm down, Madam Umeko The murder of the Inugami family is no longer a local matter But one of national interest So? We need your help in this investigation But I need your help with my life Mr. Enzo? Is this Enzo? Yes Miss Tamayo is now in the empty house inside the village She's unconscious Fetch her now! Don't tell anyone Go now! Haru! Oh! I've been waiting for you Are you hungry? Eat all you want Sorry to bother you I'm glad you know a college professor Did you see him? Yes What kind of poison is this? Using acetic acid to create an alkaloid compound Someone laced the cigarettes with poison to come up with special white crystals Special? Did the professor explain this? It's probably a plant extract He needs more time to get a detail analysis I see. Please... Did he mention poppy? The main ingredient is morphine Yes, there are traces of it Really? Please... You're not eating? I don't have time Really? Bill please! You've been a great help! A professor of pharmacology among the regulars of Nasu Inn Does he go there often? Let me - No I insist on paying That won't be necessary I'll get my fees I'm sorry Since last year I need to use the bathroom more often Really? Shall I start from the beginning? Please Well? How can she play with a death in the family? Where is Suketomo? He's late When you inhale the poison and the smoke It'll irritate the lungs And rupture the veins, resulting in instant death That's why the poison is not in the stomach but in the lungs Wakabayashi didn't die from food poison But from inhaling the poison You're working hard on the case Yes! You're on the wrong track No, this is the way to resolve the case Where have you been? Sukekiyo? I heard you have left the army Must be rough on you! Sorry I didn't send my regards I heard about what happened Don't be too sad Thank you Those rumors are awful The newspapers reports are out of line Blind people like me are spared from such troubles Perhaps I'm the lucky one It's 4 o'clock Wake up! Suketomo is not back yet! I'm worried - Sayoko! - Morning! Suketomo hasn't been back I haven't seen him since yesterday afternoon We should call the Police I thought you hate the Police That's a separate matter He's not a mouse He can't possibly hide in here Calm down! Please don't cry, Aunt Umeko This is awful! Please perform the autopsy This is not the scene of the crime The body has been moved again? Look None of the tiles are broken Commissioner A string from a koto? He's strangled by a string? No, maybe just a camouflage First chrysanthemum, now koto What does that mean? I can't believe Suketomo is dead Hard to believe You were the last one to see Suketake alive And now this This is not good The Police will suspect you I want to make sure, Miss Tamayo Suketomo covered your nose on the boat You don't remember anything afterwards? I vaguely remember someone yelling Like they were arguing Was there someone else? Could that be the killer? Not necessarily It's your fault, Commissioner When you foolishly suspect I was the killer My dear Suketomo is being killed You have an obligation to me to catch this killer Must be Tamayo Don't jump to conclusions You can't interfere with the investigation You believe that girl? My Suketomo will never resort to using chloroform I know because I'm his Mother Tamayo is lying to protect herself But a girl can't move the body to the roof Then it must be Enzo Matsuko You must be relieved Suketake and Suketomo are dead Only Sukekiyo is left You'll get your wish Commissioner I heard there was a string on Suketomo's neck Is that true? But the actual weapon is something much thicker First is chrysanthemum, then koto Axe, chrysanthemum and koto What does that mean? Matsuko To avenge Suketake and Suketomo We must bring that up I can't stand it anymore Such an evil, horrible incident I must reveal the family scandal We all have different mothers Father was never legally married Our mothers-sole purpose was to satisfy Father's sexual desire When he was 52 or 53 He had the audacity to impregnate the maid That girl Kikuno gave him a son And Father gave her the 3 family treasures An axe, koto and chrysanthemum That's absurd! That's unforgivable! We decided to teach Kikuno a lesson And retrieve the treasures We found Kikuno on a farm I curse you I will take revenge some day Kikuno was crying when she swore to take revenge Madam Takeko thinks this is related to the murders? They were merciless Never cross a woman Mr. Furutachi What became of Kikuno and her son? She went to Toyama and stayed with relatives She died in an air raid Her life is so tragic I heard Sizuma enlisted in the army And was never heard from again I get it The veteran is Sizuma He's the killer He wants the inheritance to himself so he sets out to kill the others Inoue Send out a warrant for his arrest Axe, koto and chrysanthemum The last Head of the Shrine Taiji Nonomiya first came up with the names And made an axe, koto and chrysanthemum in gold They became shrine treasures When Sahei Inugami started his business Mr. Nonomiya gave them to him as a present But they remained in the shrine for safe keeping? Yes Axe, koto and chrysanthemum Axe, koto and chrysanthemum They were supposed to guard the shrine Now they have become a curse The axe is left You think there'll be another murder? Where was old Mr. Inugami born? It's unknown He was a drifter He was 17 when he arrived at Nasu He passed out in front of the shrine like a hungry dog Mr. Nonomiya saved his life The money he needed to start the business also came from Mr. Nonomiya Taiji Nonomiya and Sahei Inugami's fates have since then become one Are they homosexuals? Where did you hear that? From Mr. Furutachi How is this related to the case? Mr. Oyama Are you related to the Nonomiya family? We're distant relatives How long have you been here? 15 years Mr. Oyama To prevent further tragedies Please tell me everything you know including the smallest incidents about the Inugamis and the Nonomiyas Miss Tamayo is Mr. Inugami's granddaughter? From these chests in the Nasu Shrine warehouse There are old documents I didn't believe it at first about Miss Tamayo's secret identity I kept my mouth shut and never told anyone until now - Yes I used to love old books And you? No... I was going through these chests And I found out the unusual relationship between Taiji Nonomiya and Master Sahei Even though Nonomiya was married He was unable to consummate the relationship with his wife So he was very fond of Master Sahei His virginal wife Haruyo eventually had an affair with Master Sahei When Nonomiya found out He gave them his blessing and encouraged them to be together Why would he do that? Perhaps to make it up to Haruyo for what he failed to give her Or he was afraid how people will judge him He could not divorce his wife and be with Master Sahei openly According to Master Sahei's diary That period was most painful to him He respected Taiji Nonomiya and truly loved Madam Haruyo They later had a daughter, Kanko Taiji Nonomiya treated Kanko as his own When Kanko got married She gave birth to Miss Tamayo Master Sahei loved Miss Tamayo and was very fond of her Because she's his granddaughter The tycoon who dominated Shinshu led a secret life Mr. Furutachi I have a feeling the multiple murders at hand is a result of Master Sahei's will power Mr. Kindaichi He passed away 7 months ago How is that possible? You're right, this is preposterous What's wrong with me? The only woman he loved was the wife of his benefactor He let off his long suppressed emotions through money, women, power And other human desires and vices He ruined many lives Madam Kikuno The Inugami sisters and their mothers Matsuko, go back inside! We must say goodbye Don't worry about me Your Father gave me a lot of money I have to go You'll soon grow up Mr. Furutachi Where is Madam Matsuko's mother? I haven't seen her for 7 or 8 years Mr. Oyama saw her recently in the neighborhood I think her name is Ozono Beyond those hills is where her brother lives But she doesn't go there often Make up your mind, Miss Tamayo Suketake and Suketomo are dead Sukekiyo is your only choice for a husband I want to know your decision You're not talking? You have no other choice I refuse What? Do you know what you're saying? If you refuse to marry Sukekiyo You'll lose your inheritance You don't care? Say something, Miss Tamayo Auntie, this man is not Sukekiyo Sukekiyo Mother I am Sukekiyo Alright? Where have you been? I've been looking for you I want to talk to you The warehouse is fine How can you not be my son? Tamayo is lying! I don't know anymore Say something, Sukekiyo She's right Your beloved Sukekiyo has disappeared Who are you? I am Sizuma Seisyo You and your sisters have tortured and humiliated my mother I am Kikuno Seisyo's son, Sizuma My mother died when I was 9 She cursed you on her death bed You and your whole family I promised myself I will take my revenge I will avenge my Mother Because of a sad twist of fate When I enlisted in the army I met Sukekiyo in the battlefield in Burma I approached him And promised to let bygones be bygones We're of the same height and build And we got along well Your son was a good man When the war escalated Our troops were separated His unit was wiped out I managed to stay alive despite my disfigurement Even my voice changed The hatred towards your family kept me alive I decided to pose as Sukekiyo because I wanted the Inugami estate It seems like a game I'll enjoy Dip it in the water again Is that Sukekiyo's body? Yes, the head was chopped by an axe It's now complete Axe, koto and chrysanthemum 3 different methods of murder It happened again! Sukekiyo was murdered! Where have you been? It's not important anymore Commissioner, can you get the dead man's hand print and finger prints? Finger prints? That's what Miss Tamayo said She did? The hand prints matched last time That's the problem Well? This is odd This is a totally different print He's not Sukekiyo? You can say that They swapped What? Using the mask The real Sukekiyo swapped with the impostor Whose body did we just find? Probably Sizuma Really? I get it! The veteran at the inn is the killer Sukekiyo Stay back! I'm the killer I killed Suketake, Suketomo and Sizuma Sukekiyo, I... I'm a wanted criminal, I probably won't get away I'm prepared Say no more! I intended to die in battle I didn't care But I wanted to see you Leave the family, Tamayo Forget everything and start a new life Understand? Mr. Kindaichi You didn't come back to the inn Yes Where are you going now? I'm going out! To work on the case? Let me come with you I want to go with you I'm in a hurry! See you later Are you following me? Long time no see No wonder you're upset It's my fault Miss Tamayo became a murder suspect But don't worry I'll disappear soon enough What are you doing? Sukekiyo I'm sorry to bother you I heard Sukekiyo showed up "My Confession" Sukekiyo Inugami Did he write this? Please take a look I don't want to turn this in to the Police I, Sukekiyo Inugami committed the recent murders This is my confession This is his way of saying goodbye I think so too Miss Tamayo You know the body in the lake is not Sukekiyo? I may make a mistake with anyone else but not Sukekiyo Let me keep this for now What happened, Enzo? Is it Sukekiyo? Did you write this? You threatened Sizuma to help you kill Suketake and Suketomo And you offered him a share of the estate Right? Yes You killed Sizuma because you can't agree on the terms? No You intended to kill Sizuma all along? Can't be! It was Sizuma who threatened you! Sukekiyo You can't possibly kill everyone In Wakabayashi's case He died on September 19th You came home on the 20th I didn't kill Wakabayashi I'm only responsible for the Inugami murders Did you hear that, Commissioner? Sukekiyo admitted he was the veteran who showed up at the inn in the middle of the night When you arrived at Hakata You read about the impostors from the papers With an intention to swap with him and pretending that nothing had happened You showed up at the inn in a mask You left the inn at 10pm that night Snuck inside the house to look for the impostor You were right Sizuma was the impostor But since Sizuma was disfigured You couldn't swap back Then Suketake showed up and you went into hiding When Miss Tamayo came Things happened the way she described it After she left with Enzo Suketake was murdered And you witnessed it You saw the killer? You mean this man is not the killer? You want to protect the killer So you wrote the confession and took action But paper can't hold fire Only if you tell us the truth can you save the killer Madam Matsuko is the killer, right? It's Kindaichi Come in Excuse me What do you want? Can you tell me whether the body in the lake is Sukekiyo? The Police called this morning Madam Matsuko, Sukekiyo is in custody Where is he? Sukekiyo is suspected of 3 murders That's absurd! Sukekiyo is not a killer That's right, he's not Because you are What proof do you have against me? You told Mr. Wakabayashi to read the will Me? Wakabayashi took your money But got scared after he read the will And came to me for help Shut up! So you silenced him Who do you think you are? What right do you have? You're not the Police I was in Hakata when Wakabayashi died I was perplexed by that too Killers often arrange for their own alibi To kill Mr. Wakabayashi at will You laced poison and went away If I knew about the will I wouldn't be so surprised when it was announced I went to see your Mother at Iwagi Village I wanted to know more about Master Sahei Inugami But I found out something else Your Mother saw you when you gave cigarettes to Mr. Wakabayashi You paid your Mother off When you went to Hakata She saw you at the Nasu station I have cut off relations with her She's no longer my mother Who'd believe her? After you killed Wakabayashi You went after Suketake You didn't know Sukekiyo was on the terrace that night Sukekiyo? He was with Sizuma Sukekiyo After you left, Sizuma promised Sukekiyo He wouldn't expose you as long as Sukekiyo followed his orders From then onwards Sukekiyo has reluctantly become Sizuma's slave I'm doing this to save your Mother A woman is too weak to chop off a human head When you saw Suketake's head on the mannequin You were probably more surprised than anyone else Even the killer doesn't know the accomplice But the accomplice took care of the bodies That's the most unusual thing about these murders You and your sisters were left out of the will In order to force Miss Tamayo to marry Sukekiyo You murdered these people But you didn't realize Miss Tamayo is Master Sahei's granddaughter Miss Tamayo's mother is the daughter of Master Sahei and Haruyo Nonomiya I have a feeling Maser Sahei is somehow using you to make his dream come true Tamayo is not the descendant of Nonomiya? Impossible... Let me see Sukekiyo Sukekiyo Sukekiyo Mother You're safe! It's wonderful! When your unit was wiped out in Burma I lost all hope to live I prayed to the Gods not to take you and let you live My prayers have been answered I didn't expect to see you again It has been 5 years I'll never forget that day in the rain when you joined the Matsumoto unit If you're alive Why didn't you come home? Because of my mistake my unit was wiped out I was too ashamed to come home I missed you so much in Hakata I made the most ridiculous mistake I mistook Sizuma for you You must forgive me A twist of fate A terrible twist of fate A recurring terrible twist of fate I can't believe Matsuko is the killer I don't believe it Please explain yourself, Commissioner I'm not over reacting But this is too absurd, too horrible I can barely speak! Calm down, Umeko How can I? Matsuko killed your son too! Madam Matsuko is most unfortunate Why must we suffer such horrible fates? Please calm down Under Mr. Kindaichi's persuasion Madam Matsuko calmed down when she saw Sukekiyo We should go see her It started out as a twist of fate But when they keep recurring and overlap To take advantage of it requires high intelligence The kind Sizuma was trained for in the army Because it's a must on the battlefront! Because of the hand print Sizuma was afraid he'll be exposed as an impostor So he ordered Sukekiyo to swap with him that night Sukekiyo stayed behind wearing the mask Sizuma put on the army uniform And disposed of the headless corpse He abandoned the boat at Guanyin Cape and returned to the inn in Sukekiyo's place When the print was made the next day Obviously they matched The night, they swapped again Before that day It did occur to me that man was not Sukekiyo But when the prints matched I was really happy Even for a split second I should never doubt my son When my koto teacher came that night Something happened and I lost myself again! Or perhaps someone was controlling me That's ruthless! My poor Suketomo Don't cry! After the fight Suketomo was exhausted That's cruel! He snuck back into the house Sukekiyo and Sizuma moved him to the roof? Yes Why did you call Enzo asking him to escort Miss Tamayo home but instead you came back here? I was worried about Tamayo What about the string? Sizuma said it's the curse of the 3 treasures After chrysanthemum, he must use the string According to the koto teacher When Madam Matsuko was playing The teacher said After playing for 4 or 5 years You can already hear chaos from the sound of the koto There was a death in the family Yet she still wanted her lesson That was the first questionable point At first, she played well But after the break I realized her index finger was wounded Yet she tried to hide it and finished the song in pain That was particularly strange I was determined to pose as Sukekiyo And take the entire estate Everything will be mine! Tamayo, the inheritance, everything I won I have beaten the Inugami family Did you leave Sizuma's body in the lake? Takeko Umeko Please forgive me I had no choice Father had us, but not out of love I hate him But I can't escape his legacy The night we kept vigil for Suketake Who snuck into Miss Tamayo's room? Sizuma Why? He found out about Miss Tamayo's plan And wanted to steal the watch But Suketake didn't have it on him I didn't know about the finger prints The watch fell out when his body hit the ground I picked it up When you killed Suketake and Suketomo Didn't you think of the consequences? All I wanted was to get them out of the way Whether I'll get caught or a death sentence I simply didn't care Will Sukekiyo be found guilty? Probably Regardless of his reasons He was an accomplice after the fact How heavy is his penalty? I don't know Death penalty? Unlikely. The judge will use his discretion Miss Tamayo Will you wait for Sukekiyo? I will If he wants me to That's wonderful! You put a hole in Miss Tamayo's boat And read the will, right? Sukekiyo Free Tamayo from your grandfather's legacy Damn... She laced the cigarettes with the same poison that killed Wakabayashi Say goodbye to Mr. Kindaichi for me I'm going It's still early! $3,500 is your fee $427 is your allowance Thank you I'll count it - Please! Thanks for your help, Mr. Kindaichi I'll give you a receipt That's not necessary I must - May I borrow this? - Please Here's some money It's a token of my appreciation I can't take that - Don't say that! - No! - Please accept it! Such an incredible case! I doubt if the Police alone would have been able to crack this case Thanks for your help! If I knew about the crux of this case It wouldn't have claimed 5 lives I'm very sorry Please forgive me Really? That's such a shame The Commissioner and Miss Tamayo And the waitress wish to see you off I'll be there of course Oh no! I hate goodbyes! It's so distressing! When is the earlier train? How can you do this? Furutachi Law Offices Hello! I'll find out at the station Can you do anything? I'm off! Thanks for everything You're seeing M r. Kindaichi off too?
