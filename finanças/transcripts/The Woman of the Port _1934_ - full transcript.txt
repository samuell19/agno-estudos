THE WOMAN OF THE PORT Let's get some water Do you want some more? - I'll get you! - I bet you don't! Yes! No! Uh! Be careful, Rosario! Did you hurt yourself? Did you? Are you o.k? I'm so happy! I'm scared... my dad... I'll talk to him, it'll be fine. I hope that I'll get a better job, then... Victorio. We must get some white fabric. You're obsessed with that coffin Not long now! Manuel. Yes, sir. Take the 70cm box to this address. How are you Basilio? I'm fine Rosario, thank you. How are you daddy? Where have you been Rosario? I went for a walk with Victorio. I don't like you going out with him. You don't understand, he loves me, he's waiting to get a pay rise so he can come and talk to you. When do you want to go for a walk? What will Rosario say? Rosario is just a friend. A friend, I thought that... What? What is it doctor? Tell him to follow my instructions, if something happens call me again. Is it serious doctor? He might relapse tonight. One moment doctor. - Take this doctor. - Thank you. The doctor looks concerned. Poor Don Antonio. What's the girl going to do if her father dies? I'll get the medicine. Girls are better at coping alone. Her! She'll starve. Her boyfriend can support her. If they get married! I don't see him rushing to get married. I'm glad she didn't ask us to pay for the medicine I couldn't even save for the drops for my rheumatism. I didn't have anything! I'd like to help her, but charity begins at home. Hello Rosario! Nice to see you! - I didn't want to come Don Basilio. - Why? Because I like you! Don't be silly. I like you. An old man's passion! Rosario. Don't talk to me like that Basilio, I'm very sad. - Is it your father again? - Yes. The doctor's positive, but... What? We don't have the money, I wanted... You wanted to borrow it, didn't you? My father will pay you back. You owe me a lot, always the same! I can't. Unless you... What, Don Basilio? No, not here! It's up to you! For your dad! You could have anything you want. Don Basilio! Well, if you aren't reasonable... My dad's job made him ill. He made you money! I paid him well. You destroyed my dad's life. And now you want me to... - Wait Rosario, wait. - Get off me, get off me. It'll be your fault if my dad dies! It's up to you! Do you want to buy anything? She's going to see her boyfriend... I'd never ask for money from a man who's not my husband. It's you! Let me explain, she's from my town! Don't say anything. Listen, Rosario... Don't talk to me! - What do you want? - From you, nothing! I told you not to come up! I love you, Rosario. Do you? You said you'd marry me just to get what you wanted. Shut up, Rosario! They can hear us. Let them hear! I don't care. For God's sake! Shut up! My father is dying. Holy Mary! Now I know why her father's dying! I thought you'd be on my side I know I can't count on you! Listen, Rosario. Get off me! Leave me, bastard! We have to tell the housekeeper... You're so right Doña Lupe! Of course! Witches! Bastard! Good evening. Is Antonio still ill? Yes, Don Francisco, very ill. God knows! Painkillers please. - Do you have a prescription? - Yes sir. You need a prescription. It's 2.50. Do you want it? Yes... Can I pay you later? I'll pay you! Please, don't be mean. I'll do what you want. My father is dying. Take it! I hope your dad gets better. Thank you, sir, thank you! We'll be broke if you go on this way. Stop it woman! The rich will pay. Hello. Coming to the carnival? I can't, my dad's still unwell. Come on, I'll lend you a costume. No! Not now. If dad's better I'll go tomorrow. Tomorrow then! Bye! See you tomorrow. Dad! Dad! It's her fault that her dad died. It isn't my fault! It isn't! Poor Rosario. I heard her crying - I'd like to keep her company. - No! But mum, she's alone. I pity her also, but she's a bad girl and I don't want you to be friends. Nobody is keeping her company. Nobody ever will! We all know what she's like. Poor Rosario. Take one coffin to Don Antonio's. Yes sir. - This one? - Yes, that one, that one. Take it to the cemetery later. Aren't you going to the funeral? Later, I don't want to get in trouble. All right! Gentlemen! Kill the bad mood! Bad mood, die! Die! No, no please! My God! Leave me, please! Back off, idiots! It's Don Antonio's funeral! Back off! Move! It's Don Antonio's funeral! It's Don Antonio's funeral! It's Don Antonio's funeral! It's Don Antonio's funeral! Move! You were hoping for this. I've nobody to defend me. Don't be like that Rosario. I'm not trying anything, I just want to keep you company. Leave me alone, go! Why are you so sad? I remember my uncle Germano. What happened to him? He died because of a bad throat. What? His throat? He was strangled. Very funny, come on! Tomorrow we'll be in your homeland... Yes! Don't you feel anything? Of course! I've been away too long! You feel something when you return! Us sailors don't have a home though. The sea is home to us. I'd like to go back to Buenos Aires, to see my parents, but for now there's no chance. Life's like that, you get on with it. Don't be sad! Distant sad light of the suburb. My distant grey city. Love's now but a sad memory. She came and remembered my passion. I forget on the waves of the sea. But I wish for my boat to return. The soul in my song keeps searching. So tell her I'm trying to forget. The soul in my song keeps searching. So tell her I'm trying to forget. The soul in my song keeps searching. So tell her I'm trying to forget. You're very good! You know, I used to have a great voice... ...but now I just croak Turn portside! ¡Veracruz! Land, at last! All crew to stations! To stations! Ok, low down! Deck crew, Franca! Ok captain, let's go!

What would you say to her? I would tell her that I saw Alberto. Where? In Havana. Where was he going? To Buenos Aires, I think. Do you really know Alberto? Why do you ask again? I've already said yes! What do you want him for? Nothing! Maybe you know him! No! Why do you insist then? Don't tell him that you saw me or you spoke to me. - Promise! - Good. He should know that his parents died. How do you know? Promise you'll keep a secret! I promise! I'm his sister! Rosario! Alberto! Rosario! Rosario! How would I know? Tell me! How did this happen? Don't blame me, Alberto! When dad died, I had no choice. I thought you were dead... I didn't recognize you. When I left you were a little girl. And now... ...how come you didn't recognize me? I see so many men! They all look the same to me! Rosario! My sister! My God! What happened? She was crying. Leave me! Rosario! Rosario! Rosario! Rosario! Rosario! Rosario! Rosario! Rosario!
