I assume you have no objections. - Why us? - Pardon? - Why us? Uh, this is Russell Hayes, Robert. Uh, he drives the van and shifts around the equipment. - They did request for him to be included. - He's the roadie. I see. I think it's rather more a question of, "Why them?" than, "Why us?", as far as you're concerned? Hm? Basically, what I have in mind is this: That with the right management, we can turn the group into a success. Since it's their wish, you're welcome to be involved for the present. - Still the roadie. - That's what I said. Anything else? Right. Tony will put you in the picture as to where we go from here. But, uh, do you actually like what we do? My personal preference really doesn't come into it. Let me put it this way: I don't smoke cigarettes, but I manage to sell a few. All right? You see, it's all a matter of packaging, Paul. - Packaging, promotion. - I'm not a bloody fish finger! [Tony laughs] Yes, but that's part of the problem. They're a well-known commodity.

You've had quite a time of it out there, I hear! - We were shot at! Real bullets, you know. - Yes, I know! Just been reading about it. Extraordinary. You are front page news. - Well, who was it? Anybody we know? - [laughs] I don't think so. It's a nice bit of free publicity. What, being shot in the arse from some stinking boat? Who needs it? You need it! No, you need it! Come and meet everyone! In you come. - Ah, Tony. Anyone hurt? - No, actually. - Good. Judy! Now come and meet these gentlemen. - Barry, Paul, Charlie. - Hello. Stoker. And Russell, the road manager. And Maggie. - Angie! - Angie! Angie. My wife, Judy. - Hello. - Now, let's have a drink. This calls for celebration. - What, us nearly getting killed? No, the fact that we've probably sold another twenty thousand records. I'll have a rum and black, ta. - Darling. - Hmm? - A rum and black. - Erm. - Now why don't you come meet everyone? Yes, uh, whiskey? Why don't you help yourselves? Stoker, there's someone I'd like you to meet. Brian. Stoker, this is Brian Sommers. He'll be handling your publicity in the future. Brian, this is Stoker, who is the vocalist for the group. - I'm not the vocalist, I'm the singer. - Well, how do you do? - I'm all right. I think we ought to organise some sort of photocall for the press shortly. Something flame-orientated, hm? You know, something to do with fire, burning. How about a picture of us sliding down a greasy pole in a fire station? - Yes, that's an idea! - In the nude, maybe. - Hmm. - Give us a drink, Russ, will ya? - Excuse me. [television announcer] There'll be an emergency session of the United Nations security council tomorrow. The battle for the pirate radio stations entered a new phase today when armed men attacked Radio City which is transmitting from the old wartime forts in the Thames Estuary. Although there were no casualties, the rock group Flame had a narrow escape and they had to be airlifted from the fort by helicopter. A spokesman for the Ministry of Defence says that although the forts have... [loud gushing] - Your brainwave, wasn't it, Stoker? - I was only joking, I never though he'd take me seriously! - This your idea? - Yeah! But I was only kidding! - Still, good publicity! - [Paul] That all you think about? Getting your face in the papers? - Oh, that's enough, uh, I think gentlemen. Thank you, Tony. - Yes, OK fellas. - [Seymour] They've got to get to the BBC in 20 minutes so... - Listen, fellas, we must get moving. Now then, I've laid on Disc and Jackie for Friday morning. - But we must get Susie Magazine done tomorrow. - Oh screw Susie...

That's all they, all they, that's all they had... - This is the wrong colour! - Well that's all they had, I'm telling you! They're all closed round 'ere. I've been miles looking for that. - Well listen, do you want it or not? - No, I don't! [photographer] This way, Barry. [shutter clicks] Still worth the money, Russell? [crowd chants] We want Flame!
