As I said, this is gonna be a survival hike with limited food and no weapons, but in case of an emergency, you do have a food drop. We're gonna try and make it without it. If anyone has any second thoughts, the time to back out is now. All right, if there's no objections, the trip starts right now. Let's pick up our gear and hike on over to the big birds. Hey Steve. Hey Tucker. What kind of goods are you peddling? Oowee, you're putting some fat on there, chico. Yeah. That ain't good for your heart, especially up here in this thin air. Come on now, Steve. Ever since you been up here, I never seen a group like that. Young kid, his mother, and the Indian, and the cripple, for Christ's sake, what the hell is he doing here? That's Roy Moore, old buddy, NFL old pro. Now if you'd quit chasing bear around, you'd know that. Besides, we're only going to sugar meadow, out on the top of the mountain. It's all downhill for this group. Yeah, but... Will you look at that? I never seen one of them down this low before. Well Tucker, I'll see you in two weeks. You just make sure there's a lot of cold beer here when I get back. But I'm not joking now. We've been having all types of accidents up here the last week or so, and they just don't seem to stop. So you take that to your mountain. Okay. What'd you say your last name was? Santee. Jenson is my name. I'm an advertiser. Ecology, that's why I'm here. Get it firsthand, that's where it's all at today. You know that commercial on TV with the Indian with the tear in his eye? That great? Indians don't cry, you know. Come on, Mandy, smile, we're gonna have a good time. We came on this trip to try and pull together again, remember? If you paid more attention to me and a little less to your law office, Frank, we wouldn't need this trip. How you two kids doing? All right. Fine. Hey you don't look like you have much muscle there. How you gonna fist fight those wild animals? I'm stronger than you think, Mr. Buckner. Why don't you kids get that second chopper? Which one is it? Right over there. Okay, thanks. Gonna be a rough trip, Professor. Doing it for science? To hell with science, Mr. Buckner. I gotta get away once in a while. You travel pretty heavy for a man that wants to get away. I know. I'm a camera buff, see. My hobbies are photography and birds. Figure I'll get my fill of both on this trip. You first. Thanks Kemo Sabe. Kemo Sabe? That's funny. Silver bullet. Hey Professor. Why don't you get in that other chopper? Sure. Hey, I know where I've seen you before. Yeah? You're anchorman of the evening news, right? That's anchorwoman, in case you hadn't noticed the difference, Mr. Buckner. All right, Miss Marsh. Why don't you ride in the second chopper with me? I got a story that just might interest you. I'll bet you have, but you see, I'm on vacation now. This does remind me of a rodeo I covered once though. I was up to my ears in bull then too. There you go. Bob, this is terrific. This is great. Thanks, Professor. It's gonna be a rough trip. Are you big and bad enough to handle it? John bad, why, he wrote the book on it. Come on, get in. Ma. He's gonna be all right, Mrs. Goodwyn. I hope so. Christ's sake, does it have to be this fast? Enough already, Jenson? Gonna have to send you back to Madison Avenue. Hey Moore. Hey, hike one two three football player, how you like to tackle this? Mighty pretty lake right over that ridge. Wanna take a walk over and take a swim? Do I get an exclusive on that invitation or shall I broadcast it to the rest of the group? Forget it. Already my feet are killing me. A Danny Boone I'm not. It's those little beans in there they're trying to get to. Yeah, squirrels and chipmunks. See them in there, yeah? Hey y'all quit laughing at my cooking, huh! They taste good, I think. Mrs. Goodwyn. Drink it. For Christ's sakes, don't bathe in it, ma'am. Don't bathe in it, he says, like I need this. You sure you can hold me now? Yes I'm sure. Professor. That's gonna be beautiful. You see something, Mr. Santee? What is it, Santee? I don't know. There's no sound. Just old Indian medicine man making jokes. Like back on the reservation, eh, Kemo Sabe? My boy! Get that bird away from my boy! Get him away! Bob, I'm scared. That was weird. I've never seen anything like it. Neither have I. Is that normal, I mean what just happened? There's no news story here, miss anchor lady. Now there's nothing to worry about. All right, we still have three miles before we get to the next campsite. Load up. Hello, dog. Don't like to be friendly, huh? Well. Get me a size and a beer, will you, hon? Ordering chili size. It's a weird day. Sun will drill right through you and it ain't even hot. Hey Tucker, think the sun's gonna get through all that? Let me tell you, we been catching rainwater in the siv around here for the past week, ain't we? Well it ain't over yet. Thank you, Suzie. Got a report on a couple bare snake bites. They came right at them, seven rattlers. The way they were bit up. It's weird, huh? God sent a plague down on us because we're just a bunch of no good fellows. We sure are that, Sam. The ozone layer is of profound importance because it protects us from the harmful effects of the sun's radiation. Got a pair of queens here? I wanna listen to this. I been hearing that ozone crap all day. The earth's ozone layer was being depleted by a constant release of various chemical wastes in the atmosphere. Like that martian attack hoax we heard on the radio a long time ago, ain't it? Yeah, I remember. Maggie hoarded up 12 quarts of garlic dill pickles under her bed, just in case he attacked the house. Sam, nobody's listening, man. A complete report to the nation will be released later on this evening. Although the effect on living organisms is not yet known, people are being advised to remain indoors whenever possible, especially those in high altitude areas where the sun's rays will be naturally stronger. Reports from all over the world are flooding in. We'll bring you further bulletins on this situation as it continues to develop. Jesus. I told you that sun seemed damn peculiar today. Suzie. Give me a piece of pineapple pie and dump some ice cream on it. John, stop throwing those rocks! Cut that out, your mom's gonna get mad at you - throwing those rocks. - Hit him. Made this hike a dozen times. Nothing to worry about. Watch your step, man. We're not sure what the event might be, but it's believed that the results will be stronger in higher altitudes. Hey mom. I just heard something weird. Yeah well don't bother me now, John. I don't know what I'm doing up this godforsaken mountain anyway. It should be your father's job! That's his job, it should be! Kind of hard growing up, huh, son? She's always doing that. Well, you know how older folks are. Sometimes they can be pretty foolish. Hey, Mr. Goodwyn, why don't you take the point and I'll try to keep up with you, okay? Okay, Mr. Santee, but if I go too fast for you, you just holler, I'll slow down. Okay. Wow. Will you look at this. Imagine running into someone way up here. Well, looks like no one's home. Imagine somebody going off and just leaving a fire burning like this. It just doesn't seem right. Yeah, it does seem strange. They're probably off hunting, fishing, hiking, or something. Wonder who they are. Well whoever they are, they'll be back before long. This whole walking thing is crazy. Would sane people walk all the way to the top of a mountain to set up a tent to walk around some more? Crazy. You'll get used to it, mom. Yeah. Tomorrow you'll be doing as good as I am. It's okay, son. First day's always the hardest. I'm thinking we'll make camp right over there. They might not like it, our invading their privacy like this. Like it? They're gonna love it, fun-loving group like us. Come on. I think it's best we keep the fire up tonight and post a guard. You really think it's that serious? I don't know. There's something strange in the woods and I don't know what it is. Could you do me a favor, Santee? Could you keep this to yourself for a while? We don't really know what's going on, and well, these city folks, sure wouldn't take much to panic them. Okay, I'll share the watch with you tonight. Wake me at 2:30. And don't worry, nobody's gonna know anything like that. John! John, stop throwing those rocks! John, you'll get lost! Do you hear me? John, if you can't act decent, I'll take you home! John, get back here! You stop throwing rocks or I scalp you. - You better be quiet, Mrs. - Goodwyn, he'll scalp you. I don't know what I'm doing here anyway. I should be in Beverly Hills, where any civilized person would be. Mrs. Goodwyn, he's a good boy. All he needs is guidance. You think I don't try? It's not easy being a mother and a father. Mr. Santee, a boy should have a father. He really needs somebody he can talk to. What do I know about the woods and the hiking? You know where his father is right now? At some Beverly Hills cocktail party pulling off another one of his big deals. - The problem is yours, Mrs. - Goodwyn, not your husband's. When I was a boy, my father couldn't wait to get off the reservation. Even changed his name to Mr. White. I spent half my life living as Mr. White, and one day I discovered I was really Daniel Santee. Now my mother spent all that time thinking it was my father's job to bring me up. Don't make the same mistake. When I left his father, I thought everything would be easy, we'd have fun together. The young are so different today. They want different things. The boy's himself, Mrs. Goodwyn. Guide him. Don't force him. Excuse me. Ladies and gentlemen, excuse me. Might I suggest that we get some sleep? We have a lot of walking to do in the morning. Good idea. Thank you. Wanna take a walk in the willows, my little chickadee? God, that's bad. He's cute. Reminds me of a couple I once knew. Yeah. Let's just hope he doesn't find any law books to cuddle up with at night. Excuse me, can I have my sleeping bag? I still can't help but wonder where these people are. I know, I know, you said they probably just wandered off too far to get back by dark. Come on, Steve. I'm a reporter. Now I don't know if the others noticed it or not, but the only thing missing around here to make the mystery complete, our untouched mugs of steaming coffee. With an imagination like that, should've been a novelist. Tell me, how'd you become one of those news ladies? Well first, I was sent to college to become something practical, like a schoolteacher. So what happened? I had an affair with a journalism professor. The affair was a dud, but the course was terrific. Well now, you know what should do, don't you? What? You ought to take my course, advanced woodlore. Buck, I tell you, after the professor, I swore off instructors for life. Take it easy, take it easy, she'll be all right! She'll be all right! I'm sorry. Take it easy. All right, we're gonna head directly to the food drop area. You and Mandy take most of the supplies. When you get to the ranger station, they'll call in a chopper and get you on down to town. Great. Now take this map and don't take any shortcuts. Here, take that. You got the matches? Yeah, I got them. Now build a fire every night and sleep sitting up. Keep her very close to you. If you can, try to find caves to sleep in. Sleep sitting up? You don't think that... He doesn't think anything. Now the animal might've been sick, that's all. You just make it, remember. Don't leave her alone five minutes, okay? I won't. Do as we tell you and keep going, okay? Okay. You get up to that ranger station, you tell them to send that chopper up and buzz us, just for the hell of it, all right? Okay. You ready? You're gonna be fine. Be better, okay? I will, thanks. Frank, she's still pretty weak. Don't push her too hard, okay? I'll take good care of her. I know you will. You two are gonna be all right. Let's go, honey. Bye. Take care. Goodbye, Mandy. All right, let's pack it up. I thought people were supposed to be safe in groups. Little did I realize it doesn't always work out that way. Do you think that Mandy will be all right? Oh yeah, I think she was more frightened than anything else. She's so pretty. I hope she won't be scarred for life. No. I think that's part of the reason that Steve let them go back down, so that she could get proper medical attention and there wouldn't be any scarring, so don't worry. I think you never should've got your tail out of a La Costa Spa. Hey you watch your mouth. Give me that. Thank you. That was a very nice thing to do, huh? Yeah. Hey there Steve. What do you think it was last night? The wolf, coyote? I don't know. I'm beginning to think this whole thing is crap, this no food, no weapons business, live with nature ho ho ho ho. People have problems in cities. I'm not talking about the city, sonny, I'm talking about out here where you can die from starvation or be eaten by big teeth when you don't have protection. All right, Mr. Jenson. We survive without weapons. The forest, it'll provide us food. Yeah, I know, you're scratching moss off the rocks. I made a TV commercial about that once. Hey Jenson. If you take this, it's better protection. Me no need spear. Me mighty warrior. What's the matter? Can't you talk plain? Hey come on, I'm only kidding. You're an Indian. That's nothing to be ashamed of. Come on, I'm just making a little joke, Kemo Sabe. Very funny. No, it's not funny. I'll take it. You don't need a spear, fellow. You need a cane. Just watch yourselves. The footing get pretty loose around here. You all right? Frank, they're all over the place. Come on. They want us to leave. Come on. All right, watch your step. Careful. They're following us. Why? Why would they do that? It's all right. It's all right. We'll be okay. We've gotta keep moving. Come on. What do they want with us? What in the hell do they want with us? Mandy. We're gonna make it out of here in one piece. You've gotta pull yourself together, you understand? We've got a long way to go. Oh my god. Just as I knew it. Come on, come on, let me help you up. There's nothing gonna hurt you, come on. Get away! Get your hands away! How did I ever think we could be together? God I hate you. I hate you! All right, dammit, get up yourself. Get up and move before these damn birds eat your eyes out! Come on! Mandy! Help me, somebody! I'm coming! Hold on! Hold on! Hold on, Mandy! Hold on! Mandy! All right, let's keep together, it ain't far. I know you're tired. Hey mom. Yeah, son? They're saying something weird on the radio. What? What are they saying? I don't know, it's broken up. Wait a minute. Here, no, give it to me, John. I can do it, John. Mom, it's my radio! - Mom! - Give it to me. I can get it mom. - I'll get it, mom! - John! Dammit, mom. John, never mind that. What did the men say? They were talking about ozone radiation. Everybody's getting out of the high altitudes. John, look, was it a program or a play or what? No, it was a reporter on a news broadcast or something. It was all broken up. It didn't make sense. It doesn't work. Oh great. Maybe we can dry the connections. Hey hotshot, we're out of food. I know. Where's that food that's supposed to be around here? It's up ahead. You say. That's right, I say. You hear that? Hotshot says there's food up ahead, that's if he's reading his map right. Well what the hell, let's get going. I'm hungry. Okay, Mr. Jenson, get your ass in gear and let's go. Hotshot's losing his cool. Little girl, who are you? What's your name? Your parents, are they here? No, of course they're not. Of course they're not. Hey, here's something to eat. Come on, take it. Well, there it is, let's go get it. Food! All right now, let's take it easy. Let's don't twist an ankle. I'm right behind you! Get it Johnny! There it is! I can't wait, I am so starving! All right, go get it Johnny! I knew Mr. Buckner knew what he was doing! Mr. Buckner! Look! There's nothing here but garbage, garbage. Didn't anybody plan one damn thing for this? How about it, Buckner? We got our asses in gear. Is this what you call a food supply? Just calm down, Mr. Jenson. Just calm down. Mr. Buckner, I'm hungry. Don't worry, Johnny, we'll find something. This is just terrific, animals biting people and no food. What do you suggest we do now, hotshot? One thing for sure, a lot of well-fed animals running around. Do you know if this ozone thing has got something to do with it? I don't know what it is, but I feel it. Like what? Like an overworked imagination, which we don't need right now. No no no no no no, it's not my imagination. Whatever it is, it's not my imagination. Look, it's like I just said, great, there's no food, and mighty animal spirits are stalking the land. Now what the hell are we gonna do? In the first place, nothing's gonna happen, not as long as we stay together. Now Frank and Mandy, they ought to get down to that ranger station sometime today. Ought to be help up here by first light the latest. That's fine, but what do we do? Do we stay here or move on? What? That chopper doesn't show, we move on. All right. There's one thing. We gotta act like we got no one but ourselves to get us down off this mountain. Now hold on just a minute, hotshot. I think it's a big mistake for us to go wandering away from here. Yeah. Maybe it's just lessens the chances of us getting picked up. Absolutely. We go out there and get stuck in the middle of nowhere, and you haven't been right so far, hotshot. Mighty advertising executive speak with empty head. We've been stuck in the middle of nowhere ever since those copters dropped us off. Listen, Kemo Sabe, those copters brought this food here, they know where this place is. It's a point in his goddamn map. Hey wait a minute! So this is not in the middle of nowhere! I think the thing we ought to do is just to sit tight, find whatever food we can around here. Smart boy. All right, the debate's over. Hold on now, wait a minute. This is important. It's important enough for us all to take a vote on it. Let's take one. The way I see it is we can all just stay here and we can defend ourselves, now can't we, hotshot? I said can't we, hotshot? Don't call me hotshot. I'll call you any damn thing I like. Your batting average is pretty bad. The radio said the high country's been evacuated. Now I'm with Steve. We move fast and we get down. And I'm with Steve. Mr. Buckner, as far as I'm concerned, you're still calling the shots here. Yeah, me too. We gonna make camp here tonight. First thing in the morning, we're gonna gather as much food as we can. Then we're gonna head down the valley. Now that's it. Let's make camp. I've got it. You go back to sleep. Okay, okay. Early in the morning. Broadway Joey ain't here, but old man Tucker's available. Jeez you sleep sound. I was beginning to think they got you. Bert. Is that you? What's up? I got the Army here. It's really hit the fan on this ozone business. Tucker, animals are going crazy everywhere. What? It's going on everywhere above 5,000 feet. We gotta clear everybody out, the campers, the cabins, the whole damn town. When? We're gonna start with the town right now, tonight. Now? Hell, it's after midnight! You can't drag people out like that! You'll scare them half to death! Tucker, this is martial law. You get Rena down to the city and you get your tail here now! Okay! Okay. That loon is damn peculiar. Wow. Well, nothing. Nothing. Oh Jesus. Hey! Dammit, dog, get out of here! Get, dog! Rena! Rena! Dammit, Rena, get your clothes on. What is it? Shut up. Just the rats! The rats have gone crazy. Now come on! Tucker, I don't like going down without you. Yeah, I know, but I have work to do, so you just keep your windows rolled up and stay in line with the others, and when you get to the motel, you call me and let me know you're okay. As soon as I finish with this, I'll come down and get you. All right, Tucker. All right. Don't worry, you hear? All right. All right, gentlemen, you've all been assigned numbers. Wait just a minute. When your number is called, please proceed to the vehicle in an orderly fashion. We will attempt to avert panic. Okay, you all have your numbers and I don't expect to have any trouble from you. What in the world happened to you? Rats. Damn rats. Well? Hey listen, Tucker, crack of dawn, we hit those mountains and pull everybody out of there. Man, I got that Buckner group up in the high peaks. I had a feeling something bad was gonna happen. I just knew it. You got some more torches. Will these be enough? They ought to be. Do you think they'll help? Oh sure. All animals are afraid of fire. What time do you have? We have 35 minutes left. I feel like every animal out there is watching us. Me too. What I don't understand is why. I wish I knew. How did they get those food containers open? Simple. Engineering skill learned from evolutionary adaptation. Simple. Roy Moore has cancer, doesn't he? Gee, I don't know, Terry. But I think so. Yeah. All the geniuses in my field said he just played one season too many. What a shame. A young man like that. Terrible waste. The book I read said something about scientists being cold and calculating. I read that book too. I didn't believe it either. Help me! Get away! Did you see its teeth? Are you okay? Yeah. Yeah, I think so. Cats are not supposed to attack in groups. Yeah, we don't have enough fire. That's what it is, not enough fire. We should've stayed awake on watch. Don't give me that. I was awake. First Mandy, and now this. Where are the helicopters you promised us? Where are they? Mom. Get in there! Where are they? Enough. Yeah, how can we defend ourselves without weapons, Buckner? Enough! All the screaming and yelling isn't gonna help any of us. It's gonna be dawn in about 30 minutes. Then we'll go get about gathering food. Just relax. Just relax. Oh it stings. Maybe you're allergic to the sun. The sun? How come I wasn't allergic to it in Beverly Hills or the Riviera? Maybe in Beverly Hills or the Riviera, it didn't know you was rich. Oh, you're very funny! It's a stick! I thought it was a snake. Got another one. Hey, Mr. Santee, I think I see one. Easy, easy. Easy! Easy. Here professor, hold onto it, hey! All right, I got one! All right! Get it, Prof! Well, we'll pack up all the food we can carry. If we leave now we can get down in two days. I've been thinking. After that attack last night, I think we should all go up to the ranger tower where Frank went. Can it, Jenson. No, you can it. You're not the big mocker anymore. I say we go up to the tower. The big what, Mr. Jenson? Big mocker. Boss, Professor. Advertising executive talk. Now you were the head of this thing at the start. That's when it was a game, you understand, a simple, safe amusement park game called Survival? Make your point. The point is it's not a game anymore! Should be obvious even to you. Hell, I could take care of us better than hotshot has done. Use your head. The only way we're gonna get out of this is if we stay together. Well let me tell you something, hotshot, I use my head all the time. A lot of people use their butts. Now it's 30 miles back down there in the valley and 15 miles up to the ranger tower. Sure, Jenson, 15 miles up to the tower. The radio said evacuate, not go back up! We're going down the valley, Mr. Jenson, and I'd like you to join us. Well I'm not through talking yet, hotshot. My name is Steve, Mr. Jenson. Did it ever occur to you if Frank and Mandy had made it to that ranger station, there'd be a chopper here now? So that's what you think now, huh? Like when you told them to go on, they'd be okay. You don't think that now, huh? There was gonna be food at devil's drop. Where's that food now, huh? I'm going up to the tower. How about you, Denning? Steve, I think he's right. Damn right I'm right. How about you, pretty lady? I think you're crazy. All right, folks. Helicopter up at the ranger tower, tonight. Back in town, warm food, warm bed. Who's gonna join me? I think that's a very good idea. I think it's a terrible idea. Hey come on, I think Mr. Jenson makes sense. No, let's stay with Steve. Come on. Let go. Sweetheart, you stay with hotshot here, and you'll end up being bear bait. I'll take the stick this time, Kemo Sabe. Leave your packs if you want to. We leave now, we'll be there by nightfall. John, come on, we're going. John! Will you come? Excuse me. Will you come when I call you? Come on, pick up the pack, let's go! We move! Move! Bye bye. Sorry. Go, go already. Old saying, my friend. You can't save fools from themselves. Can't drag them with me, dammit. Okay, pathfinder, lead the way. Head on down that way, football star. Look at the size of him. Oh my god, they're like an army. They're everyplace. Let's go. Look at that, baby. I told you we'd find a way out. Come on, we're safe. There's people here. See? Hey, anybody here? Anyone here? Hello? Anybody here? It's just that nobody's around. Come on, let's move it. Where are the warm beds and food you promised, Mr. Advertising Executive? We would've been better off staying with Buckner! You're not with hotshot Buckner now. You're with me, Miss Beverly Hills Bitch, so shut up and keep moving! Get going! You can't talk to my... You little cockroach! You gonna tell me about survival? Leave my boy alone! Just shut up! You leave my boy alone! Shut up, you little cockroach, or I'll shove you off the cliff! Up there, there's an old mine shaft. Watch out, don't slip. Hurry up. Thank you very much, but I think I can. Come on, it's really gonna open up? Moving up there. Keep moving. We're all tired! Put that pack on! You don't know where you're going! Put that pack on, you bitch! We're going around in circles! Stop hurting my mother! All right, Jenson, enough's enough! What, did somebody die so you could take charge? We're not going any further! We need rest! This is good whether you... Oh my god! You lily-livered punk! I'm running this camping trip! I take what I want and I give you what I wanna give you! Understand that? Stop it, please! Please! Right now I want that! Come on, baby. You're gonna have a real man now. You're crazy! No! Jenson! I'll kill you! Oh my god! You're thinking about the others, aren't you? Yeah. So was I. Do you really think Jenson will be able to take care of them? I don't know. I been thinking about the way he was acting, and that ozone thing. Might be going further than just animals. You mean us? Why not? I spent most of my time reporting about life, not experiencing it. Now it's like that report's about me, and I've wasted so much time. Steve, I'm really scared. Hey, come on now, come on. We'll be okay. According to the last broadcast, lower altitude's still safe. How come you know so much? Well now, that information's part of my course in advanced woodlore. You ready to sign up? Yes, Professor. Leg's getting worse, isn't it? No, it'll be all right. You wanna hear one of my lectures? One of my short ones. No. It's good. It'll take your mind off your leg. All living things die. You're a lot of laughs. Everything evolves in and out. 155,000,000 years ago, there were no animals, just insects and reptiles, that's all. That's big news, Prof. Hey, I'm just trying to tell you something. I know. I know what you're trying to tell me. You're trying to tell me that I shouldn't give a damn that cancer's eating my bones away. Mr. Moore. He's trying to tell you there is no answer. No fair, no unfair. Just accept. Accept? Accept. Why don't we just kill ourselves and be done with it then? Maybe we will. Maybe we already have. If you're not satisfied with the arrangements, you can complain to the management. Or pray. If there's a god left up there to believe in! My father who art in heaven, you made a jack ass out of me for years! It's never been you for me! Melville's god, that's a god I believe in! You see what you want and take it! You take it! I'm gonna do just that. I fought for you. I won you. You belong to me. Please. Please no. I killed a man for you. Please no. I own you. I own you! Now get up! Get up! Get up! No! No! No! No! No! Kill him, mother! Kill him! Go ahead, kill me! Kill him! Who will lead you off this goddamn mountain? Kill him! Who will feed you? Kill him! Right, kill me! Kill him! You can't kill me anyway! You haven't got the guts! Get that cockroach kid out of here, both of you! Bastard. It's a road, baby, it's a road. All right, baby. Look at that, baby. Isn't that the most beautiful thing you ever saw? Oh my god! Look at them! The place is swarming with them! Hello! Hello! Hello, anybody home? Hello there! Anybody here? Hello! Hello, is anybody home here? I've got a sick child! Please! We need help! I need a phone, a doctor! Please! Stop it and stop it now! Stop it! I can't stand this! You're a bad girl, bad! Now you just wait for me here, you understand? And don't you move! No! No! Oh god, I'm sorry. I am so sorry. I'll never leave you anywhere again. I swear it, never again. Come on. It's gonna be okay, it doesn't matter. My car's right up ahead there on the next block, by the hotel. It's gonna be all right. Hey! Hey you! Hey you there! Please wait right here, okay? Hey! Hey, fellow. God what is this? What is all this? Now listen to me. I know what I said to you before about leaving you alone and all that, but I've got to, just for a minute. Do you understand? I've gotta get to my car. You see that little blue one over there? Then I'm gonna bring it right back here to get you. You gotta wait in here until I get back, no matter what. Right here with the doors and windows shut tight, the way they are right now. You musn't follow me, not at all. Promise? Help me! Help me! Please help me! Oh god! Oh god! Help me! Little girl! Let's rest a minute. Logging camp ahead. How far? Oh, about seven, eight miles. Terry. Thank you. What about your turn? I'm not thirsty. Canteen's been evolved, Prof, in and out. We're gonna make it. It doesn't matter anymore. Gotta keep going, man. Yeah, okay. Come on. Come on, let's go. Roy. Yeah. Mom! Look! John! John, come back! John! Come back! John! Careful! Careful. John, back! John! Hurry, mama! Run! Run, Beth! Run! Run! Well there it is. We'll rest here tonight. A touch of civilization. As Shirley would say, the Beverly Hilton it isn't. I never thought I could be so tired. Well, woo, you're not alone. I wonder how much they charge a night here. Not too much. Oh look. What I wouldn't give for a cold one of these. You gotta accept, Prof. Let's check out some of the other cabins. Head for that cabin! Go go go! Keep moving! Come on, Prof! Hurry up! Watch your step! Let's go let's go! Daniel, shut it! Daniel. But they're dogs, just dogs. It looks like they've gone. Tell you what. We better get out of here before they get back. Get out of here! Get out, you hear me? Head for the water! Let's get in! But I can't swim! Dammit! Water, get in the water! She can't swim! Let's break this loose! What about Roy and the Professor? They've had it. They've had it. Get on! Jesus! Come on! Get on the raft, Daniel! Hang on, Terry! Mama! Beth, wake up! Mama, look what's happened! They're all dead. What killed them, mom? Beth, we made it! We made it! We did it, ma! Oh we made it, John! Look at it! Land base to Unit 3. Situation report, please. Dead animals and looters everywhere. This place looks like World War III hit it. That confirms Sector 2's report. Above 5,000, all animals are dying. Human survivors appear to be immune. Can you mop up and report survivors immediately? Roger base. Three clear. Base to chopper 2. Go ahead, base. Any survivors in your sector? Got three we found in a wrecked chopper. We're bringing them in now. 10-4. Check them into State General on touchdown. We're trying to find out why some of the people have immunity. Roger base. Damn looter, should've known better than to come in here with all these animals. Hell of a price to pay. Thank god this thing didn't go on any longer or there wouldn't be anybody left. Field division to all units. Environmental Protection Agency report shift in the ozone level continues to correct itself. The virus mutation infecting animal and human life is unable to sustain itself as the sun's radiation decreases to normal levels. All altitudes will be completely safe within 24 hours. Hey commander, looks like something's moving over there in the Jeep! All altitudes will be safe within 24 hours. Unit 3 back to base. Just found a little six or seven-year-old girl, near shock but seems to be okay. Looks like we're gonna be okay. It's over.
