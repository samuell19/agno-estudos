THE WEDDING MARCH VIENNA - Anno Domini 1914 with its oldest guardian, St. Stephen's guiding - comforting- consoling and its so contrasting symbol, the "Iron Man"- a remnant of the Middle Ages heartless - soulless - threatening where Hapsburg's throne stands - Glorious and Proud. In the shadow of the Emperor's Palace - aloof, feudal, imposing but crumbling stands the residence of the Princes von Wildeliebe-Rauffenburg. Maria Immaculata, Princess von Wildeliebe-Rauffenburg. "Your Highness, today is 'Corpus Christi'..." "All right!" Prince Ottokar von Wildeliebe-Rauffenburg His Majesty's Chamberlain and Lord Steward General of Cavalry - Captain of all Guards. "...and get the hell out!" "Well - say it!" "Come on - say it!" "You - ugly old fool!" "If you could only see yourself!" "It's pitiful!" The "love child" of this ideal, blissful union slumbered still. His Highness, Nicholas Ehrhart Hans Karl Maria, Prince von Wildeliebe-Rauffenburg His Majesty's Chamberlain and First Lieutenant of the Imperial and Royal Life Guard-Mounted. "Your Highness, today is 'Corpus Christi'..." "Why this unusual pleasure?" "I thought - I might drive over with you, Papa!" "If you think you can touch me - forget about it!" "I'm in a terrible hole!" "Blow out your brains!" "...or..." "...marry money!" "Well - I'll see Mama about it!" "How much does the hand kiss cost this morning?" "No joking, Mother - I'm in a terrible hole!" "Stop your poker and your expensive girlies..." "...or marry money!" "Marry money - that's all I hear!" "I'll tell you what we'll do..." "...select the bride, Mother - and I'll walk down the aisle with her..." "...to the Wedding March - tomorrow!" "But remember - she must have money..." "...mountains of money!" "Meanwhile, if you can let me have a little..." Then, Corpus Christi - the greatest religious and military celebration of the year. "Just stick around me, folks!" "That's the truth, Frau Schrammell - my boy, Schani, always gets the best place!" "You said it, Herr Eberle - the girl that gets him for a husband is lucky!" "Did you get that - Mitzi?" "Didn't you hear your mother say you're lucky?" "Are you harpin' again on the same old thing?" "What do you think I'm hangin' 'round you fer - huh?" "I thought we came here to see the Procession - an' not to talk!" "Well - if Herr Schani wants to talk about it now..." "I don't see why you shouldn't wanta!" "Saphead! You're goin' to lose the best chance you'll ever have!" "You don't want our Mitzi to marry a man she doesn't love?" "Ain't that a nice view?" "Ain't we got no right to see nothin' a-tall?" "That's one o' them swells that don't do nothin'..." "...lots o' gold tassels an' plumes..." "...and we're payin' fer it!" "But he looks nice - don't he?" "Just gimme his masquerade - an' watch me!" "Don't they smell sweet?" "I ain't smellin' nothin' - but the stink o' horses!" "Married?" "If it weren't for old man Schweisser's corn-plaster business..." "...his daughter would not be such a bad match for Nicki - would she?" "...and old Schweisser himself is so very ambitious." "I'd thought of it myself..." "...but - the girl limps!" "What's a little limp - with twenty millions!" "Is she badly hurt?" "You are under arrest!" Then, the Procession - the Procession that Mitzi had waited so long to see. There is no such thing as accident. It is Fate - mis-named. "My father." "How are you?" "Much better - Thanks!" "I don't know how to thank you." "Herr Oberleutnant!" "My name is - Nicki." "Nicki - what?" "I'll bet you have a name - a kilometer long!" "So let's make it - just Nicki!" "I thought - you might like them!" "I might like them!" "...the best I ever had - was when father bought for me..." "...a five-cent bag of jelly beans!" Then, dreamy Nussdorf. "I ain't goin' to let that skirt-chaser ruin Mitzi's chances with Schani!" After the guests had gone. "You owe me a kiss, Mitzi." "You blew out the match!" "Our beautiful 'Blue Danube'!" "Down there - the 'Danube-Maids' come to the shore - some times..." "...to see them means happiness - an' luck..." "...an' love!" "I never saw them - an' I s'pose I never will!" "But I'm satisfied just so I don't ever see the 'Iron Man'!" "What do they say about him?" "They say - some nights he comes to life..." "...an' drags away a 'Danube-Maid'!" "An' to the ones who see him..." "...comes Sorrow - Grief - an' Death!" "You believe that, Mitzerl?" "It is nothing - but the people's foolish fancies!" "That's my Fairy Coach..." "...where I dream an' wish I'd see the 'Danube-Maids'!" "Perhaps I'll bring you luck - and we shall see them!" "A drive through Paradise!" "You were made for love - Mitzerl!" "You mustn't say the things to me..." "...that you say to your fine ladies..." "...because I might believe them." "I want you to believe them!" "An' - you'll come again?" A few days afterward, Schani was released from prison. "Jailbird!" "Seen Mitzi yet?" "The way this woman-hound's been chasin' Mitzi is somethin' awful!" "Well - he believes in workin' fast!" "She's out in the buggy!" "Oh - so that's the way you feel - huh?" "...that's what I get fer goin' to jail fer you!" "You mushin' 'round with this here sow-bone!" "Just let me get my hands on him!" "I'll kick his glass-eyed mug to goulash!" Then, in that little crooked house - in that little crooked street. "...a kiss all around - and then I leave you." "Are you leaving before old Schweisser's party?" "Tonight I crave apple blossoms!" "Apple blossoms! What do you mean?" "I'm going to meet a real nice girl." "At this hour of the morning?" "It's when her parents snore the loudest!" "I was afraid you would not come." "I was on duty - I couldn't get away!" "This-h is - my party!" Schweisser's Red Raven Corn Plasters "...now listen... Highness... I... h-have... a... p-proposition..." "...y-you... h-have... a n-nice son!" "...a-an'... n-no - m-money!" "...u-understand?" "...a-an'... I h-have... a n-nice... g-girl..." "...a-and... l-lots - o-o'... m-money!!" "...u-understand??" "...N-Now... h-how... a-about... m-my d-daughter..." "...a-an'... Y-YOUR -- son...?" "...u-understand??" "I-I'll... fix... your... s-son... u-up - right." "...u-understand??" "How much do I get?" "Five Hunder' Thousan' Kronen!" "HOW MUCH?" "One million kronen!" "...t-thass... a... gentleman's... agreement..." "...u-understand??" "...an' you will come again?" "...an' love me always?" "Always!" "The 'Iron Man'!" "Nothing but shadows, dear - and fog!" It was mid-morning before Schweisser dragged himself home- to face his daughter. "I... I was with His Highness Prince von Wildeliebe-Rauffenburg..." "We have arranged for you and his son Prince Nicki..." "...to get married!" "But I have never even met the Prince!" "You will - soon." "How could he be in love with me?" "You have twenty millions!" "Money couldn't make a man feel love!" "Don't be a silly little goose - love will come - in time." "Princess Cecelia - doesn't that sound nice?" "A limping Princess!" "I presume you even proposed to the young lady..." "...or did you leave that insignificant little detail to me?" "Did it ever occur to you that I might be in love with somebody else?" "You - in love?" "You idiot!" "Of course, you two wouldn't know - but some people do fall in love - really!" "But marriage is one thing and love another!" "N'est-ce pas - Ottokar?" "I am tired of this nonsense!" "I command!" "The wedding is on the First of June!" "How dare he talk to me that way!" "But, Nicki..." "...this would mean so much money!" "How much?" "A huge fortune!" "Seems to me that girl limps - on both legs!" "Peace be with you, my child..." Then, Nature mourned - the birds were hushed - it rained, rained, and rained. "Your father wants you at the Inn, Schani." "I wanta show you somethin'..." "...here's good news o' your Prince Charmin'!" "Now he's gave you the kick - how about an honest offer?" "There ain't many guys as broadminded as me!" "Let's get hooked up proper, an' for good!" "I love you - Mitzerl!" "I hate you!" "I hate you!" "I love him!" "And I always will!" "I'll kill that dirty dog..." "...when he comes out o' church today!" "...until death doth you part!" "Nicki..." "I love these apple blossoms." "So do I." "Please don't! I'll marry you..." "...honest I will!" "So... I'm good enough now?" "All right - we'll get married!" "Say your last 'Ta-Ta' to him!" "Who was that sweet girl - in tears?" "...and that awful looking man?" "I - I never saw them before!" "How beautiful - these apple blossoms are!" "Won't they always remind you...?" "Yes - always!"
