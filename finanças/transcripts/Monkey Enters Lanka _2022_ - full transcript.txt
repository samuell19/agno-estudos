The world's fastest growing crime is abduction and human trafficking In 201724 million victims were estimated worldwide Those who don't know history are doomed to repeat it This film is based on a true event Due to years of cultural adaptations across Asia Elements may have been subject to artistic liberties Lanka, a once prosperous land ruled by the wealthy king Kubera now stands robbed and overthrown by a tyrant king Ravana Women from all corners of the Earth are being snatched against their will to satisfy Ravana's lust and perverted thrills Let go of me Let go of me Your... Where is your leader? If your leader is so powerful Why can't he face us? We will fight our way out of this! I was only beginning to witness Lanka's sad state of affairs but however much I want to, I cannot yet interfere for the reason I was here were for matters else for a dear friend.. Lord Rama I had promised to help His beloved wife has been missing for almost a year a matter, no loving couple could ever bear Don't worry They say thatâ€¦ Ravana cannot rape anyone, he needs their consent This is due to a curse... Once Ravana tried to molest a girl called Vedavati to escape him she set herself on fire, her last words cursing him... That if he dared rape anyone again... he will burst into flames and die Since then they say he is afraid to molest anyone All clues pointed towards Lanka's tyrant king if I find the princess here the hellish planets will shudder at the havoc I will bring My only sister is dead Curse you Ravana you filthy pig may your wives, lands and riches burn before your very eyes You may wonder just exactly who am I? My feats have made even Yama, the God of Death cry I have acquired many names over my long life But none of those matter to me any longer I am the servant of Rama, here to help find his wife Mother, does Ravana really have 10 heads? Sssh Please, leave me I do not like this "like"? I will torture you into liking it The aura was dark everywhere I turned for men had abandoned righteousness with lust they burned Lust leads to greed, greed leads to anger anger leads to suffering, which was clear amongst Ravana's Lanka Listen to me very carefully that lady has driven our king to madness there is some divine power in her You mean the one in the Asoka gardens right? Yes As soon as I saw her, I knew it was Sita I was looking at a divine soul, the universe beneath her So you see every living being is a fragment of the ultimate there is the supreme soul and the energy force of nature that nature is feminine Never undermine your own nature as a female The soul doesn't have a gender I hope that makes you happy for the morning Although her distress of separation from Rama was clear, her golden aura radiated more than the gold paved city for which she didn't seem to care Sita the way you talk of Rama, almost makes us fall in love with him too We have never heard of such an ideal man, ideal king, ideal husband where you left us last was where you stayed in the forest and saw the golden deer Do tell us more Sister the very day I saw the golden deer was the very fateful day I saw Lord Rama for the last time when I saw the deer I was hypnotised with desire desire of ownership the very trait that leads to one's downfall my loving Rama went to catch it for me that's when your... king... Oh no! The King is coming Run! We will be killed if caught here! Upon seeing Ravan, I realised what had become of him this was a man who had fallen to his own ego Sita, Sita beauty of all beauties whose face glows more radiantly than the sunrise by this tree if only you would look at me I would make all my wives your handmaidens immediately Oh why? Why does she not see this handsome Ravan? And his might? And put up this uneccessary fight? Darling I stayed awake the entire night and wrote this for you Will I turn away again without your love? You know many women die for my glance yet you still stick to your old, traditional marriage vows speak, please say something Can a lotus flower grow in the light of a firefly? You do not know of Rama's radiance you are but an insect in comparison nor have you faced his arrows in battle You clearly displayed your so-called might when you abducted me only, and only when I was all alone to you women are objects but in the kingdom of Lord Rama every woman is treated as a Goddess Sita you have offered me one too many insults Have I not been a gentleman to you waiting for your consent Name me one king who has as much wealth as I do You could have anything you desire The wise do not find happiness in material things They find their joy looking within themselves Alright, I'm getting tired of this Pleasures conceived in the world of the senses alone have a beginning and an end and eventually lead to misery nothing material is permanent happiness And please be honest You are no gentleman the real reason you have waited for my consent is because of your curse that if you were to make love to one without her consent you would burst into flames How do you know that? Whose been speaking behind my back? Speak up Who told you this? How do you know this? Who has been speaking behind my back Speak up Sita I have given you too much luxury You are my property now You belong to me Do you understand? I should behead you here I do not fear you or your blade strike now... and you will only relieve me from my sorrow of being separated from my Lord O Ravana there are many concubines for you to enjoy today Why waste your time with her? Security You Do what you will with Sita but in one month, if she doesn't accept me willingly I will draw my sword again and this time her head will lie at my feet and so will all of yours and so will yours Look my husband has taken a liking to you if you don't give in, he will kill you I don't understand this kingdom has everything you would ever want it can make your dreams come true, just say yes that is all you have to do, just give in just compromise This poor soul has endured a lot of sorrow, torment and pain I wanted to liberate her immediately, so it didn't happen again right now, if I make any move I put the mission and her at risk I must be stealthy and wait until night, so the task can be accomplished these moments felt like the passing of an entire age I couldn't wait to tell her of Rama, cheer her up and then show these demons my rage Only one month left Haven't forgotten me have you? The once beautiful Surpanakha who any man would die for turned down by the handsome Rama for you after what his brother did to me watch and see what my brother Ravana will do to you To the very personification of nobility and righteousness Glory to Rama Darling to his citizens and adhered to by many sages Glory to Lord Rama Whose heart belongs to princess Sita Glory to Lord Rama What trickery is this? Who now searches heartbroken for his beloved wife Sita and sent this monkey to find her Glory to Lord Rama Please don't fear me divine Mother I came as Lord Rama's messenger I've never seen you in Rama's kingdom Who are you? How do you know my Lord and his anthem? I have many names, but he calls me Hanuman you may do also much has happened since you went missing now armies of monkeys are in search parties spanning all corners of the Earth helping Rama find you Lord Rama? Search parties looking for me? Is it really true? My Lord hasn't forgotten about me? Divine Mother, I know it is hard to believe but Lord Rama was confident I would be the one to find you and so he gave me this ring to present to you as a token of trust How is he? He must have been so distraught from my sudden dissapearance by bodily health he may look well but I can barely begin to describe his distress, being separated from you He loves you twice as much as you love him he asked me to deliver this message Sita Ever since I have been separated from you Everything has become its reverse Fresh and tender leaves on trees look like fire The moon scorches like the sun Lotuses look like spears Fragrant breezes sound like hissing serpents I long with all my heart to see you again Divine Mother it brought much sorrow to my heart to see the pain in the eyes of King Rama and now after meeting you today I cannot bare to see another in pain of being separated from their loved one I wish I could take you back with me right now but I see no practical way of doing so O Hanuman I'm so grateful for you You have delivered me from my sorrows However I worry for the state of several other women here like me I do not wish to leave them as they are I wish to wait for Lord Rama he will help bring reform to this society Indeed, I have seen the state of women in this dark kingdom yet, you had the strength to fight back Now that you have been located Await Rama's arrows fill these skies and wipe out these demons I will insure you and Lord Rama reunite soon just begin reciting his glories and before you can be finished, we will be back Hanuman I'm so pleased to have met you and to hear of my husband but if I were to recite all his glories it would take me years please don't make it that long Here take this he will know it is mine May I ask, Hanuman? How do you know Lord Rama? What brought this alliance between man and monkey? He came to us seeking for help and my kind, we never turn anybody down as you know the rules state Rama is forbidden from entering any city But... I have witnessed myself how he doesn't need a kingdom to be King he is the loving friend of the poor, and treats all equally all my monkey friends now serve him and will be ready to lay their life down for him O Hanuman But Hanuman have you seen how big and ferocious the people here are? Some apparently have battled beings on heavenly planets I worry For yourself and your... monkeys do you think you have the strength or experience in warfare? Even Lord Yama, the God of Death, shudders when he hears my name I am sworn to help and protect those who come to me and those who pledge allegiance to Lord Rama What you are about to witness now is just a teaser of what my army is capable of Let me insure no demon torments you again until I return with Lord Rama Once Ravana is done with Sita who do you think he is going to pass... Fruit thief in the Ashoka gardens, kill it immediately Hand me the weapon of Lord Brahma (Brahmastra) I hope you all become better men in your next lives Once I've crushed your filthy skulls I shall slay this beast and prove that I am Meganath Son of Ravan You and you prove yourselves Don't you worry, it's not over yet I purposely fell to that weapon as towards it's creator I have much respect Strip off his armour and take him to the King Who are you monkey? And how dare you injure my men? Have you not heard my name and trembled with fear? I am here as the messenger of Lord Rama Hanuman Have you no heard my Lord's name and trembled with fear? He who single-handedly defeated mighty tyrants mightier than you Foolish monkey You dare threaten me, the mighty Ravan with a name of a mere human being? Impotent monkey I am not the least troubled by your provocations Nor by your Rama Now How dare you steal fruits from my garden and injure my men? Funny The theft of a mere fruit enrages you Yet you have no problem with righteousness to abduct human beings against their will How dare you? Regarding your men They attacked me with intention to kill I attacked back Self defense Ravana It's Lord Ravana Please Heed my advice Return the princess Sita to her rightful husband and give up your evil ways Man is never beyond redemption My King is compassionate He will forgive you Really? I require the forgiveness of a mere human being? You know, Ravana If it wasn't for your ego Your sense of "I, I, I, Me, Me, Me, Mine, Mine, Mine" You could be a great King, like Rama Ravana will be damned, before he takes advice from a lowly monkey Just who do you think you are? Do you not know where you stand? You have been caught by the great Ravan Correction You have not caught the messenger of Lord Rama The messenger of Rama let himself be caught to get a good look at the fool who waged war with his mighty Rama What I mean is It is I who has captured you I will have you tortured and beheaded Choose your words wisely Hah Fool, there is no weapon on Earth or any other Heavenly planet belonging to any God that can harm me I could finish you right now if I wished But as a messenger I would be insulting King Rama since I am missing a mandate from him Kill this creature immediately Stop Forgive me your grace I'm sorry to interrupt But, it is against all statecraft to kill a messenger Vibishan, my brother what good timing What do you suggest that we do with him then? Well, you might be able to punish him but we cannot kill him A monkey's tail Is it's most precious possession If he were human I would have defaced him Such that he would not show his face again in a crowd But as we are dealing with a monkey How would he show his bottom to the rest of the pack (Laughter) Bind his tail to rags and set it on fire Hanuman The fire does not burn you It is all in the mind I will make sure your protected from it You have proven yourself as a yogi and kept your vow of celebacy I grant you the 8 supernatural powers (Ashta Siddhi) and 9 abilities (Nava Niddhi) Now Arise Remember your promise to Rama Arise (Please come to us, O Rama) (Will you come to save us, Hare Rama) (Please arrive soon, our beloved Rama) (Not only Sita, please know we too await you desperately) Hanuman, my dear friend You are twice as dear to me as my own blood brothers I know you will be the one to find my beloved Sita I trust in you Remember how you shook the heavens as a mere child Remember that title you once held Great sage, Equivalent of heaven Hare Rama HARE RAMA O fools of Ravana Slaves of arrogance Is this all you have got? Lord Ravana I'm sorry I failed you Please spare my wives and daughters, please RAVANA I will leave you at the mercy of Lord Rama Just know that I could have killed you today If he had permitted me But my mission was only, and only to locate Sita But when I return with the mighty Rama you better be ready to surrender Lord Shiva has come to free us all Soon Ravana will prepare for war But at least for now, Sita wouldn't suffer anymore As I watched the biting flames leave Sita untouched I realised something which will be told through many ages to come Sita wasn't the one being saved from Lanka Lanka was the one being saved By Sita (To Be Continued) Lanka is now known as Sri Lanka Written and Directed by Saie S Surendra Based on the epic Ramayanam, Ramacaritamanas, Ramakien, Bhagavad Gita and Journey to the West Shri Ram Jai Ram Jai Jai Ram Sita Ram Sita Ram Sita Ram Jai Jai Ram Hare Rama Hare Rama Rama Rama Hare Hare Hare Krishna Hare Krishna Krishna Krishna Hare Hare
