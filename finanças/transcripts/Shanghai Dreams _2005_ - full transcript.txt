Don't be so stubborn Do or not? What's up, Laowu? It is enough to give here some critiques. Where do you get the shoes? Whether are they bought by that bastard or not? No No? Don't be so stubborn Whatever you like to say! It's not the case at all. Okay, tell me where they come from? I picked it up outside. What? You pick it up? Ai! Could you pick up one more! I've found that you are abnormal these days! You always got out whenever you could It is nonsense what I told you, isn't it? So and the letter I burned, isn't it? Ai! Take them off! Take them off! Take them off! It is disgusting to look at them. I warn you If you still keep touch with him, What I throw out is not only the shoes! What do you see! Play the piano! Okay, don't be so angry! Your father is also for you! His only expectation is that you could go to college. Master a kind of skill when your brother is still little. So you can leave here honorably. I won't go anywhere! You don't understand. This is not our home. My grandmother does not love us at all. She does not wish we could go back to Shanghai. How can you say that your grandmother doesn't love you? When you went to Shanghai to visit her Your grandmother bought you dozens of new clothes, didn't her? Who your grandmother was angry with are your father and l. When we came here that time she is against with that, We not only oppose with her but also said that she is an antediluvian. Ai! When people are young, They always think the elder are wrong. They do not know what is right until they grow up to be adults. I don't want to know this. Neither do l. Okay, if you continue to be like this, Your father would get angry again. Come on! Finish your washing and the go to sleep. What's up, do you feel better? My head always gets hurt every night. In my opinion, stop taking the medicine. It is no use with it. Listen to it the interrupting sound become more and more serious these days. Stop doing if you cannot hear it clearly. So we won't have to worry about you. Ai! You will never understand. Staying in this hilly gully If I don't listen to it, I will know nothing. Laowu I feel Qinghong is down in spirits recently Could you please don't follow her tomorrow. If you continue do like that, I am afraid... Okay, Okay As for this thing, I don't need your reminding. I know what I should do. What are you going to do? Relax! Do it fast. Qinghong Qinghong Qinghong Dad, the dinner is okay. Okay Hey, Qinghong, How are you doing? Auntie Zhenzhen Qinghong is here You haven't had your dinner, have you? Auntie happened to cook a fish-head soup! Come on Come on Ai, I'd better stay outside. What's up, Qinghong? Are you angry with father again? Come on Her father is really boring. He follows her everyday just as she is a prisoner. He has gone too far. How are you, Uncle? Qinghong, take your seats please. The Laowu is too strict. Zhenzhen go to take a bench. Qinghong, it doesn't matter! Have the dinner first. After we finish the dinner Your uncle will take you to your home. Your father wouldn't do anything to you. In fact, the parents are for you to be good Yeah But he can't be like this even though he is for us. Sometime the stricter the parents are the worse are the outcomes. Stop talking; nobody would take you as a dummy. Ai! How is the work transfer of Laowu. It is said that it's not very good. The main reason is that the factory is reluctant to let him go. In the morning, he has quarreled with Laoge. I found he was in a very bad mood these days. But he shouldn't take it out on us because of his bad mood. Don't add fuel to the flames. Don't wait! Let's eat. Little brother, come to have dinner Stop, go on waiting. What are you doing? We won't have the dinner until she comes back today. This is your fault. I have told you about that many times, If children do the wrong things they should be educated indeed. But you took her as a prisoner. She is old enough, Have you think about her sense of self-esteem? It is because of you. You always talk about my fault here and there in front of children. Now, Your daughter oppose with me openly, You are satisfied, aren't you? Think about your education method, How can she agree with you? How good a person you are! You are so good at peacemaker. Okay, both of us work as peacemaker. If something is wrong who take the responsibility? I haven't found there will be anything wrong. You haven't found! At what time have you found? What can you find? Once you have found it it will be too late! How do l? How do l? I know In these years All your intelligible dissatisfaction is because of me! Yeah, it's I who encumbered you that time! It's I who wanted to come here. I know I am wrong. But you can't hate me for an entire lifetime. We have live like this for so many years How do you want me to be? How do I want you to be? How do I want to be? What I want is that our children will never live like us to have a same ten-year life. Therefore, l, just like a dog, follow our leaders everyday to beg for this or beg for that What I want is that they can go back home go back to Shanghai How about you? Only an easiest word You are wrong You are wrong Can you change all these things? Can you start over these ten years? About the litter girl, you are also clearly about her, her those love letters! Aha, and also her high-heel shoes You have seen it, haven't you? How can we indulge her? If we allow them to develop freely We will be regret in future. Can we indulge her? I don't mean to indulge her, The child is old enough You should be in a suitable way I don't know what's the suitable way I just know We came from Shanghai Our Children must go back to Shanghai. It's nice, isn't it? Hey, The third class will hold a ball this weekend. Let's go there together If I go there, my father would beat me to death. How dare he? What's the era now! He always is so conventional. I'll talk to him tomorrow Let's go there together Hey, you can't do anything absurd. Nothing special You don't know it In fact, this ball have been held for several times And the elder don't know it at all and it's very nice I will call you tomorrow saying we go to review courses together. You go there alone. I don't want to go. You girl! I know you clearest. In fact, you desire to go much more than anyone. You are somewhat same to Lin Daiyu. Okay Okay! Don't be boring. Hey! Have you heard that? What? Lv Jun Which Lv Jun The guy looks very handsome! He has been dismissed by his factory. And his mother has some problem with her brain. Er! What's wrong with him? Well, I can't understand What a handsome boy he is! How can he fall in love with that girl of farm? And you don't know the girl is heavy with child now. Her parents came here for fight! His family is in a big trouble now. Why trouble? The girl is pregnant! So they can marry each other. Ai! It's the marriage that is troublesome. The girl is of farm. How is the farm? Why can't he marry the girl of farm? Is it your idea? If it were l, I would never marry her. If only we go back to Shanghai one day how should I do with her? Who are willing to go back to Shanghai! Anyway my dad have said my family will go back to Shanghai sooner or later. Laowu Laowu! It's me. We send Qinghong back Open the door, please! Let's her leave here! She has place to go doesn't she? Why does she come back? Laowu! Please open the door. Qinghong hasn't gone anywhere She was in my home to talk about the study with Zhenzhen. Go to open the door Meifen!

There is a lecture of district today It's about National Matriculation Test. Oh yes, it's presented by people coming from Beijing. The teacher said we could go if we like. I don't wanna go But my Dad force me to Oh! This is good thing! Hey, Qinghong! What an important thing it is! Why not told me about it? Hey, answer me! Well, It's because of you, isn't it? Think about your temper! How dare she talk with you? How does my temper? My temper Have I lost my temper on anything of study? Obviously it is because she doesn't understand what's wrong and what's right! Well, keep silent please! Okay, don't be angry! You can go now, let's me do it. No, I don't go! Think about yourself! You always want to go out However when it comes to the study you don't go! I don't go! What are you saying? Say! Go or not? Go or not? Come on! Xiaozhen, I'd better not go there! Why? Nothing! I really don't wanna go there. And I can't dance. Neither can l! How difficult you could get outside for one time! Let's have a look at that! If it's not interesting, we won't go next time. For me, Okay Let's go, Qinghong Come on! Xiaozhen, we'd better leave here! No, just for one more moment. Hey! Lv Jun, Lv Jun comes here! They are of Chiguang factory. How does Chiguang Factory. Last time they hold the ball who are prevented to take part in? Ok! Let's go! Who is so chaos? Who? Who? It was certainly the people of Chiguang Factory who did it. Let's go! Don't leave! Stop! Xiaozhen Xiaozhen Come on! Come on! Come on! Xiaozhen Qinghong! Don't be so sad! Wait me for a while, Ok? I didn't know it is so dull. We would have not been there if we knew it is like this. Qinghong, I really didn't know there would be such things. Could you listen to my explanation? Well, Xiaozhen. I am really not angry with you. I just wanna to go home. You'd better go home now Dance Wu Qinghong! You become so capable! Right? You also learned to lie and brag? Well, how dare you deceive me! Oh, it's it! It is not the first time that you deceived me! Well, so we have to change the education way! Tell me! How to do with it? Answer me! If you don't say, I warn you From tomorrow on, You can't go anywhere after class. You can only stay at home. And I am gonna to meet Laogu tomorrow I will let he give Xiaozhen some lessons. Too fie-fie It's enough, Laowu It is enough to care your own children Why do you wanna interfere others? Why not? It is irresponsible to let her slide do you know it? Okay! Okay! Criticize me of no suitable method. How to do with suitable method? I will be only in my way! I warn you Don't go to bed this evening Make a deep self-reflection! And write a profound review. What kind of teacher from Beijing Let's go, Qinghong You go first. I will never be willing to go back to home. What do you want to do? If he is still irrational like that, I will go to talk with him Well, don't be so sad We are gonna to practice in Chiguang Factory several days later, aren't we? We could enjoy a good time then Nobody cares us, Okay? Whose? Send it back immediately! Tell him I don't need it Move! I think it's really going to change this time. Laobao went back to Shanghai and wrote that It is changing outside. Especially Guangzhou, it's nearest to Hong Kong. It changes very fast. But it will be too long for our turn. Therefore we can't continue to wait. All the active people have gone out for development. Laobao said They took responsible crew system there. Paid by piecework salary. They could earn more than 300 for a month. Oh, they are so adventurous But it seems to be no guarantee. It's not without guarantee but only a bit more tired. More pay for more work. Nobody would slack off. Nobody would be willing to slack off if there is money to earn. We are too conservatory! I think it won't be so fast even though it will change. I think money is not the most important thing. What is most important is to leave here. Even we could earn countless money if we also stay in this hill gully. Ai, especially our children! Right! This is where the rub is! The key is our child It's nothing important for us Yes or no You are really too veridical. Only for a word, the revolution of whole family comes out. It is said that the salary would be promoted for three levels but no promotion has been made till now right? Please ask somebody else Who go back to Shanghai for Spring Festival? It will cost one-month salary for a trip. And even though you go back there How does it? Who will admit a relative from countryside? Anyway, I won't go back. If I go back, it is fairness to go back with my Hu Kou and Record. I don't believe that I can't earn my life without the Hu Kou and Record. Have a look at Shenzhen and Guangzhou Individuals such as self-employed householder and family with ten thousand are too many to count over. In my opinion, the only thing the society recognizes later is money. Ai, I agree! But we come here to develop the third line, It is the policy of Party They won't let us alone before the policy is clear if we really go out ourselves I think it is really somewhat a risk. Hey! Guys! There must be bleeding and death for revolution. How can you change your life if you don't take some risks? If you stay here, you will have no future at all! Laobao is right the example! So short a time he left here, How much money he earn for a month now! Yes! Shanghai is Shanghai indeed. Anyway, I won't change my attitude. To cultivate me, the Party sent me to the third line To cultivate my children I will be bound to send them back to Shanghai. Laowu You looks different! You were very active when you came here that time. Ai! My children were too little that time. She just came to the world. I have no choice. Ha-ha! You were not reluctant to leave your wife Don't talk about this. Who knew it's like this that time Ai, how couldn't I come here? So what? Let's us make the decision If we continue to wait the factory won't give us the chance to leave. It's much better that we leave here ourselves rather than just waiting. Let's think it over for sometime Mr. Wu Oh, how are you? The water seems to be not warm enough Mr. Wu, keep your washing, I'll go. Hey! Wait a moment, wash for a while with me. I happen to have something to talk with you. How old are you? How long have you come to workshop? About two months You have not been admitted to formal worker, have you? No, I haven't. You seem to take replace of your father. Ai! He should be work hurt. Are your family indigenes? Yes In Wudang District About the thing of you and Qinghong, I have heard some of that My daughter was also not very happy The youths of your age always get into impulse. Easy to do the wrong things and reluctant to obey with what the elders say. Of course, when you get to such a age, I won't oppose you to make friends But you should pay attention to if it is practical or not. Maybe you also know Our family would leave here sooner or later. And go back to Shanghai My daughter is still gonna go to college. He has many things to do in future. I think you also don't want to delay her. Mr Wu, in fact, we really In fact, I am for you. Well, it is not an easy thing for you to enter into this factory. Your family surely won't hope you can't be admitted to a former worker because of something expected. I have also talked with Qinghong several times these days. She could understand my intention. She is my daughter after all. For some things, even she understood but if you want she told you about that, she is girl after all, she will be shy about that. So I do it for her. She hopes you won't go to look for her later. And won't write those letters to her. If only she go back to Shanghai one day, You will be not too suffering. Right? Do you understand what I told you? Well, you declare your attitude. Okay Okay Okay! I'd better not force you to declare. Or you would criticize me of wrong way. I used not to be good at talking. I talked with you so much but all of that are from the bottom of heart. For the weight of it you'd better consider it seriously. I can't agree with what you do! You have gone too far! What kinds of things are in his mind? I am very clear about it. She seems to go for study. Nobody knew what she did stealthily. She thought I couldn't control her this way. She is for study, not for other thing What's more this is the unified arrangement of school I have investigated this. It is only a practice. Only have a look at workshop and have a touch on machine! It's not a big deal. Laowu. Have you think about that? How does the child think about you for what you did? She will hate us for a life. Hate? Now she hates us! She will feel it too late to acknowledge us in future! Okay, listen to me for this thing. Write the application of absence. I don't agree I could follow your with the issue of home I won't write it. Are you silly? Think about we can't control her now even she is around us. The practice should be outside for such a long time. If that guy follow her to there on the sneak. If they stay together and if they then it will be too late to regret. Why do you still stay here? Write it! Mr. Zhao, this is the application for leave of absence. Qinghong is very good at all aspects except for the health. Yes! Yes! Yes! Come on! She used to be like this when she was very young. Have a smoke! Our school attaches great importance to the practice this time. It is really a pity to miss it. Yes! Yes! Qinghong Qinghong Qinghong, are you here? Qinghong Qinghong How many days? Two days She can't continue to be like this. People can't tolerate for no food for a day. Wu Zemin I should criticize you for this. For whatever, she is big girl now, right? Even if you want to educate her you can't go too far. Ai! How do I go too far? I look after her with good food and drink everyday The only goal is that she could study very well. Go to college in future. Do I go too far? Your wish is of course right all of us hold the feeling. But you should be clear about that you daughter has been good enough I still persuade our Xiaozhen to learn from her. You worry like this is somewhat overdone. Meifen you should also talk about this with Laowu How can I argue over him! I say one word, following by his ten words. I cannot tolerate it myself. Again starts How can you so good at being a good egg? How do I do with your daughter? Have I abused her? Okay! I don't care You care. Enough! What are you quarrelling for at this time? Okay, It is impossible for her not to eat. Laowu, you should also slide away now. It is no use whatever you say this time. We take Qinghong to our home for several days and Xiaozhen is coming back Let them live together. How are you? How cold you hands feel Come on! How warm it is! Do you feel better? Do you know? My mother has told me that You father has acknowledged the corn. Now he just feel embarrassed to tack you back. How nice it is! We should punish them right in this way. But you can't always eat nothing. You will be starved. You can eat something stealthily when they are absent Let me see whether you have been starved to be thinner. Don't kid me. Go on! Tell you a mystery. What mystery? So you can't tell others. What are you afraid of! You should promise. You can't tell anyone including your parents. I have nothing to talk with them. Do you know that? That Lv Jun has come to look for me. For what? Anyway, you should promise me you would never tell anyone. We What's up with you? Have you already? Xu! Don't be heard by my Mama. Really? We have promised We would never be apart. But But he and the girl have done that haven't they? He has told me that he didn't love the girl at all. It is because of his sudden impulse. Can you believe such words? Well I knew you were bound to be like a hen with one chicken when you heard this. I just want to say it out. Well, stop talking now I want to sleep. I am so sleepy! It is not so bad that you smoke drink and fight with others. But now You went so far to ruin girls. You hooligan Dad, It's not only my fault. Don't call me Dad I am not your Dad You are my Dad Stop Don't draw me. It's you who indulge him. Laoli Stop Bastard! Apologize to the girl! Son of bitch! Uncle Lu, we can talk about everything. Stop! Stop! Get down! Get down! Stop! Stop! Son of bitch I warn you, guy, you' better not hold the idea that I am too old to catch you. Today wherever you run to Where I will follow you. Go back to home.

May you have a lovely son soon! He has said that he said he would never get married. I have told you! You can't believe what he said.. It has been like this Don't be so sad, okay? The girl is of countryside! How to do with countryside? We are of farm too, aren't we? And the girl has been so heavy with child. What's wrong with you? So mysterious Nothing I just want to stay with you for a while. Qinghong If we do not live here, Do you think where we could go? Where can we live if not here? This is our home. Xiaozhen What's wrong with you? Don't scare me! Nothing! Look how you are scared. I will never do that silly thing! I'm just thinking Why can't we live a better life? Maybe that kind of life is right in some place far from here. You mean Shanghai? Qinghong, you're my best friends aren't you? We would never be apart. Right? What are you talking about? Xiaozhen Look how you are scared. I'm fine. I will go! Qinghong Is your Mama home? She is in kitchen Something's come up! Xiaozen and the son of Lv eloped together. Qinghong Your father and I go to Xiaozhen's home. You look after the house and your brother. Stay well at home. Don't go out Don't venomously slander! How can you say that our Xiaozhen cajoled your son? You have to make it clear in front of all the people. Who is it if it's not she? All the people know that Lao Lv, It's enough! All the people knew it was your daughter who looked for our Xiaojun. Rumor! Stigmatization! Rumor! Stigmatization! You can just blah blah. Let me tell you. I have a letter you daughter write to my son. Hey! It would be clear about who cajoled just at a glance. Ai-Ya! Lao Lv, what do you want to do. The word on it I will flush to read. Have a look at it Every time I think about that I will elope with you, I will Nonsense! Rumor! Stigmatization! Whose idea is it? Is it clear? I warn you In fact, it is obviously your son who is not mannered. He had made a girl to be heavy with child he also came to cajole my daughter. It's lucky for you that I haven't On the contrary the idea of your taking it out on me! It's enough, Ai! Is it meaningful to talk about this? Yes! To begin with now, the key is that the children have run away, right? Yes! The most important thing is to find them. It will be no end if you can't find my daughter. I help you Listen to me, Listen to me! Now, the most important thing is that We get apart to look for them. Right! Right! Right! Railway station Bus station yeah yeah yeah! Somebody has gone there oh, you telegraph to Shanghai asking their grandfather and grandmother about them. Is there any message? You are back How is it? I've looked for them anywhere I can. The telegraph has been sent to Shanghai. We can do nothing but to wait for the information. The Laogu was so worried that he had shed a tear. Such an old people he also can't help tearing. Have you watched that? That is the outcome of no control. It is too late to regret now. He called this afternoon He calls the workshop He also urges me to leave. I have shown my cards to the factory. I will leave if they agree I will leave too even if they disagree What did they say? What else they could say? No change at all Such a bunch of bastards I tell you I have made my decision Tomorrow I call those guys such as Wang Enhua to talk about it once more. If they still hesitate I won't wait for them We starts to prepare these days Whenever we prepare it over we will go immediately. If we really do like this I'm somewhat afraid. Our Hu Kou and record It's doesn't matter for me. But how to do with our children? They will have no way to go to school We'll cross that bridge when we come to it. The whole country is changing There will eventually be methods for it. Oh, right Remember! Never breathe a word of it outside. Extending exercise Ready one two three four five six seven eight two two three four five six seven eight Laowu How are you? Come in, please Qinghong prepare some water for your uncles Ai my head feels so hurt every night that I can't drink any more. I open the outlook for you. Look! What smoking is it? Well Laoyang told me about this in our office yesterday. Having all smiled and ached with stomach that time. Come on I think it feels somewhat like cigar when smoke heavily. It's lighter that cigar yes the taste of cigar is too smoky. It's the time in these days the signal was always interrupted. Okay, Okay! It's okay! I'm late It doesn't matter Have you drunk? I feel cold I have been waiting you here everyday. But I haven't promise you anything. But do you remember what we said here the first time. I've never forgotten it Neither have l But We are impossible Why? We are going to leave here So, so, so you have been avoiding me? No I I just think we are too young There are dozens of things we don't understand yet Why do you hold the same tone with your father? Tell me if you leave here how to do with me? You will be good Did you just come here to tell me this today? No I Is it because I'm not from Shanghai as you? Did you look down upon me? What's the difference for people from Shanghai? Who has prescribed that people from Shanghai can't marry people of other places? I'll go. Goodbye Wait a minute I pick it back Xiaogen I can't accept it. Xiaogen Don't be like that I beg you! Xiaogen, Don't be like this Xiaogen. Don't be like this. I beg you! I beg you. Have you heard that? The party committee of factory held a special conference yesterday afternoon. None of us who requested to transfer work will be authorized. They said they are afraid of the chain-reaction. Authorize one following dozens of people who want to leave. Where did you get this message? Anyway we should come up with an idea We can't always wait like a fool. Laowang, you are acquainted with the leader of factory. Go to find someone to talk about it with the leaders It was decided by the party committee Nobody could function. If we want to leave here the only way is to escape. Laolv Don't only smoke. Say something about this. I I want to find my son firstly. It's fate. I'm afraid that I will live my life here forever. If we succeed to escape from here, and if Shanghai won't accept us that will be just one word. If you want to come back then it's really not an easy deal. What's more, the factory would never accept us if we come back. Qinghong Qinghong Where is your sister? I don't know Why do you still stay up? It's better to go to bed early.

So he confessed It is said that the rapist will be sentenced very heavily. It seems as if it should It's impossible Laowu also worry about this. He has asked about it specially. It should be not that case people of this age never consider the outcome whatever they do what a young man he is! Do harm to both other people and himself. Meifen Laogu told me that it's you who wanted to divorce, wasn't it? I would give you some critiques. Though Laowu is some abnormal you should not talk about this now. For such a long time you have pasted together anyway! At this time, you can never fight each other. The main thing is the child I think Qinghong can't continue to be like this. You must come up with an idea quickly. What idea can I have? All is up to him No matter who it's up to. If it is good for the child it's good anyway. Meifen trust me! He wanted to go back to Shanghai didn't he? I think it maybe the best method Qinghong We are leaving Give it to me. Is there somebody finding out? That's okay, nobody saw us!
