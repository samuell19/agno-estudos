Yeah? Uh... Uh... No. Say again? Jumping Music? No, mate. Mmm. Uh... Try next door. Ta-ta. You playing music now? Yeah. Can't sleep with the shower on. That my protein shake? Ah! Aah! Ooh. Ooh! Oi! Oi! Hey, you hear Jojo got sucked off by a lady journalist? Yeah, she had a deadline. He made her give him shines before he talked to her. Jojo. You don't like Jojo? Make a lovely couple, you two. Who makes the tea? You reckon he'll play tomorrow? - He strikes the ball clean. - Can't control it, though. Yeah, but his left foot, though. Yeah, he thinks he's Roberto fucking Carlos. Hits the target about as much, too. Well, that ain't gonna help you sleep. Doughnut. Have to clean your teeth again! I need some pussy, man. It's killing me. We could get a girl, take it in turns, one on, one off. You know them girls hanging in the lobby? Yeah. One of them looked like your sister. Shut up! Oh, Kenny! Danny and Leesy slipped them security guys some money to send them a couple of birds up. Yeah. But Jojo reckons they're plants, though. What. No, like special agents, man. They want their home team to win, so they come here and have sex with us. Right. I'm enjoying this theory. Because when you cum, that's your energy gone. Everyone knows that. What PE syllabus did your school do? What do I need GCSEs for? This is the Champions League, man. We made it. After tomorrow, ain't no looking back. We ain't even gonna play tomorrow. We'll just be keeping the bench warm all game. Just like last week and the week before. Jase, you... You are having me on, right? We're gonna start tomorrow. I hope you do know that. Right. We've been at this academy since we were eight. Uh, seven. All them other kids have fallen, by the way. Now, it's just me, you and Jojo. It's that new generation, we've been groomed. Jase, this is our time. I got something to show you. Jojo and Leesy tag-teamed these girls in Blackburn. Nah, nah, nah. I don't wanna watch Jojo's sorry arse bobbing up and down. Fuckin' hell. I mean, this is it. Oi. My dick's bigger than his. This is it, this is it. This bit kills me. Oh, no! "Oh, no! No!" Ahhh! That is classic! Have you seen his missus? Leesy's? Yeah, man. Do you feel bad for her? No, no, no. She must have known that man's got urges when she married him. Always dipping his willy somewhere he shouldn't be. How comes it never gets in the papers? It's not like he even tries to hide it. He's got a deal with them. Huh? You got a story you wanna keep out of papers, then you gotta find another story. Right. That is all, they don't actually care. Your agent not tell you this? Hmm? No, no. My dad handles all that. You wanna get yourself a proper agent, mate. See that? What? That. What's that? That is my celebration. Mmm. I'm going to trademark that. Put it on all my merchandise. It looks like you got a bit of dirt in your eye. Ah, ten years from now, all the little kids are going to be doing that. Are they, Ade? Yeah, you watch. What? God, you black boys. Always moisturizing. Hey, what was the name of that girl you pulled in that club? Echoes? Echoes, Echoes, Echoes. Go on. Did, uh... Did she have a tight pussy? Was it shaved? Can I ask you a question, Ade? Is it dirty? How do you square your all-consuming hunt for minge with your Christian faith? What kind of question's that? Well, I'm just giving you some practice for all them interviews you're doing. Yeah, well. You know... Black warrior prince needs his pussy, so... He likes talking about it. Huh? More pussy than you. You've been checking? Ignorant white man. I wouldn't worry, Ade. I'm sure your dad's covered you in a blanket of prayer. Sweet. Make fun of my dad! Uh, he's a nutter, and you've said it yourself. Yeah, well, he's my dad, all right? "Do you know Jesus, Jason? Do you know him in your heart?" - Straight off the bat. - Don't start. "Oh, hello, Mr. Lotomo." "Do you know Jesus?" All right, all right. Like, what was that, um... What was that thing he said? Um... "If there is sin in your..." "If there is sin in your heart, cast it out!" "How can a man outrun the devil, if the devil is in your heart?" It's the longest grace I've ever heard. My tea was cold by the time he'd finished. Imagine living with him. You believe him, though? Some of it. Yeah. What for? You should try it. Don't you fucking dare! No, don't try and convert me. I'm just saying, mate. You're a closet nut. He cracks me up, your dad. He likes you. Oh, by telling me I got the devil in my heart? That's his... That's his way. That actually means he respects you. Does he ever tell you you got the devil in your heart? You recording this? You'll wipe over the tape, man. What, Jojo's skanky home porn? There's a loss to world cinema. Stop pointing it at me. Oi! What do you reckon about Deano? Mmm. If Deano was a lolly, he'd lick himself to death. Yeah, a couple weeks back, after drills, we was all in the shower... Hmm? And everyone was talking about squad. These times, we didn't know we'd be in it. Hmm. And Deano was there. And before, I thought, "This guy's a prick. Always in your face in training, giving you a little kick." And he'd come up to me, and he's all asking me about myself, right? Man's taking a proper interest. You know, Deano, you know, he's all saying, "Don't sweat it. I know what it's like. Don't worry." - And I'm thinking, "This guy's actually all right." - Yeah. And then... Then I notice everyone is laughing, because Deano is pissing down my leg. The whole time we're talking, he is pissing down my leg in the shower. Why you laughing? Oh, he's like that with everyone. Oh, what, has he pissed down your leg? Nah. I think he's a bit racist. Nah. Well, not racist, but the things he says, though... It's a sign of affection. Pissing on my leg? He's from Portsmouth. It's cultural. Besides, he never passes it in five-a-side. Uh-huh. Told me he rated you. Yeah. On the coach when we were playing cards. Is that what you lot talk about? Compared you to Bergkamp. Bergkamp? Said you got the potential to be the next Dennis Bergkamp. Or was it Dennis Wise? Fuck off. Ah, it was "the black Dennis Wise." That's what he called you. - Yeah, yeah. You should be on telly, mate. - Hoo-hoo, I will be, mate. He's gonna regret when I take his place. Pass and move. Drop. Pass and move. Pass and move. How come you do your own boots, man? I like the smell of polish. Get you hard, does it? Not as hard as your sister when she sits on my face. -I done told you, man. What? Is she not like the other girls, Ade? Is she special? All right. All right. Oi, I think she likes me, though. Is that your ritual? Every Saturday, Dad would lay his paper down, pop the telly on, polish his boots in the front room. Mum would go spare. That his kit, yeah? Come to all your games, don't he? Mm-hmm. - In his Jag. - Yeah, one of 'em. "One of 'em"? How many houses you got again? Uh... He's a builder. It's what he does. Mmm. Yeah, my dad's too busy with his sermons. Well, he came to that thing you was in for your, um, drama exam. Rah. I forgot you'd come to that. Yeah, well, you were good in that. Yeah, what was that thing you did where you had that red material you pulled, and then... That was abstract movement, yeah. That represent... -Nah. No, I'm just remembering. It was... "Oh, oh. I love this person." - No, it was good. - Mmm. I was surprised you'd come to that. Give us a blast. Go on! Aah! I can't do it to order. Ah, too much pressure? Make sure you wash your hands! How'd you know how to play poker? What's that, mate? On the bus. You was playing with the older lot. Ah, yeah, yeah. He'd win me pocket money back off me. What? Yeah, he'd give me pocket money, we'd play cards, then he'd win it back. Said it was a lesson in life. Would you teach me to play? Jase? Ade! It is me, Babatunde. What the fuck, man? Your long-lost brother from Nigeria! Are you kidding me? Come here, Ade. Show your brother some love. Get the fuck away from me! Oh! Why you treat me so harshly? I've come so far to see you. Hey, it is me. Your brother from Nigeria you did not know you had. Your father had many children... Seriously, get the fuck away from me. Why you so sad to see Babatunde? Ade! Ade, Ade, come on, mate. I'm only having a laugh. Oi. Oi. It's just a bit of banter. You old geez? You all right, me old diamond? I want to see your plums. Two for a pound! Two for a pound! Would you like a cup of tea? Crumpet, me lady? Come and have a look! - Yeah, mate. - I'm on your bed, brother. What is that? - Get your hands off my plums. - Aah! Two plums in a brown bag! You want these plums? Oh! Oh, you dirty bugger. Oh, I just tasted your chocolate, salty balls. Aah! I've got chocolate on my balls! No, no, no, no, no. I'm never having chocolate spread again! I ain't answering that. - Oi, budge up. - Oi! Play poker. What? You, play poker? What? You serious? Yeah. Oh, don't be funny. Come on, you need a certain type of brain. You think you're smarter than me? Oh, shush. Let's just leave it, yeah? No, no, no. Oh, wait. How much you win today? Huh? Ah. Is that because you're so good at poker? What is this? The big boys didn't let you into their game? Don't know. A monkey. - Five-hundred. - Yeah. Yeah, Ade, pounds, English pounds. Five-hundred pounds. In half an hour. Ha-ha-ha! Well, next week, I'll win it back. Ooh, if you're playing. Yeah? What's that supposed to mean? You might not be picked next week. Well, we both might not be picked. I will be. Okay. So you're saying you're better than me? - Come on. - Ah. Let's leave it, yeah? No, no, actually, I'm intrigued. Oh, no, no. Oh, I understand. What? Ah! I understand. You don't understand nothing. You're just saying that to seem more mysterious, like you know something. Pressure's getting to you. It's making you act up. I ain't the one who messed up today, okay? What you talking about? What do you think I'm talking about? Do you really want to do this? You were supposed to be marking him. You were supposed to be covering. - It was your zone! - I pushed up. It was your zone! That was the whole point of the session. We were playing the overlap. That means my man becomes your man, vice versa. Every time before I've pushed on, you dropped back. - So I pushed up that time. - I was already up. Look, it wasn't me coach shouted at. I know. I know it wasn't. What was I supposed to do? Not go flying up when I was already up, leaving us open at the back! It was only a training game! Well, I'm saying, in the game, don't leave me looking like I lost my man. I'm saying, in the game, don't lose your man. Uh! We were playing the overlap. That means my man... - Don't just fucking walk off... - I'm going for a piss. No, we were talking, don't just walk off. - Oh, yes, okay. - Good. Oh, just so you know, I'll be leaving a space this side of the room. You think it's too big, Jase, you might want to push up and cover it. Next time you fancy a shot at glory, how about you give me a bit of advance notice, you cunt? They were laughing at you. Deano, Leesy, laughing at taking your money at cards and how you think you're one of the boys. That's bollocks. Said they thought you was a bit suspect. When you was in the shower. Different. "Different." What's that supposed to mean, huh? A bit... You know, man. No, I don't know. A bit posh, mate. "Posh"? "Posh"? I'm from Stanford-le-fucking-Hope! You ain't exactly from the ends, are you? I'm having a beer. Cracking up, is it? Look, let's not pretend like we don't know what's going on. They can't keep us both on, not with this new formation. Yeah, I know that, Ade. I am not thick. There is a window. I can see it closing. If I'm in a better position tomorrow, and I'm on, will you pass me the ball? This guy... When your chance come, Jase, you best take it, 'cause that's what I'm going to do. It's nothing personal. Really. Maybe I need this more than you. This is stupid. Look, whatever happens, we will always be brothers, yeah? - Here. - No. We got a game tomorrow. Ade, are you leaving me hanging? Ade... We're brothers. You doughnut. Frickin' hell, man. What's the mat... Oi! - Huh. - Oh, you fucker! Don't stop. - Huh? - Oh, yes, yes. Don't stop. Don't stop. - Do you want to squeeze me plums? - I'll squeeze your plums. He does it all! Mental! What the fuck? I'll feel your plums. You got a fucking hard-on! No, I don't. No, you did, mate. I felt it. You had a fucking hard-on. -Nah, man. You did. I won't be keeping this to myself. - Please, man. Mate, it's nothing. I... - Oh, no, man, no. No, I'll tell everyone about this. Look, look, I get nervous before a game, is all. Yeah, yeah. Pulling your leg. Doughnut. Oi, I'm pulling your leg. Loads of people get a hard-on before a game. Now, I do. I get a massive hard-on. Yeah, of course. You all right? All right? You look scared. Oh. Give us a cuddle. You bum boy. Oh... Oh... - You're very hugable, Ade. - Piss off. Doughnut. Oh. Oh, God! What a blow. Oh, fuck. If he's broken it, I won't be happy. - Oh, fuck. - I reckon it's an improvement, actually. Oh, well, that's nice. Sympathy. My nan hits harder than that. Oh, shit! - Serves you right, you cheeky bastard. - Aah! Oh, fuck. Mm-hmm. Blood on your shirt, bust-up nose. You look well fit. Yeah? Girls like that, bit of blood? Oh, yeah. I love a fella who can't handle himself. Think I broke his camera, the twat. I know. Why do you think he was so upset? You know what, I'd have floored him if you hadn't got in the fucking way. Hold your head back, soft lad. Oh, careful, careful, careful, careful. Aah! Them bouncers were like bosh. He was shitting himself. I know, I could smell it. Oi, oi, oi. - Huh? - Ooh. - Maybes a bit. - Ah. Ah. Clean yourself up, you little slut. Get us a shirt. Uh, should be some clobber on the bed. Someone's been eating their Shredded Wheat. Huh? Oh, you look like you're taking a shit. What's that? Is that your sexy face? No. It's my cum face. Oh, does that happen a lot? Getting hassle off the paparazzi? Oh, normally they're all right. It's all fun and games. I'm going to go have a piss. -All right. Oh, fucking hell. No, you're all right, pet. Well, it's your loss. It's a whopper. Ah. Fucking hell. Put some music on! Something jolly! Remote's in the wall! Got it! Right. * Hold my hand, stand by me. Is this what you listen to? What are you, 16? Oi! Fuck off, he's a mate. Did me birthday out in Miami. Are you serious? * Rescue me * Let me be the one To love you forever * * Forever * 'Cause nothing in this world Can stop the sun from shining * * And now you're around me But it's not the same * * When everything Goes my way... * Jesus, man. Footballers. Fuck me. Are you a ninja? It's a bit like where I live. Uh. Do you come out here often? Uh... Yeah, I try to stay on an extra day if we got a game down here if I can. They know me. They're discrete. You got family down here? Yeah. Mum and Dad still out east. Mmm. -Let's do this inside. Fuck off. You're not on a promise. Oh, why, you think you can resist me? - All right. Easy, tiger. - Oh, come on, I'm horny. Oh, my God. Nothing. It's just you. What? You're not how I thought you'd be. I thought you'd be less... Intelligent? Needy. "Needy"? That's the wrong word. "Vulnerable." "Vulnerable." It's like you need constant stimulation. Yeah, I do need constant stimulation. I bet you were one of 'em really annoying kids that needs constant attention. - Teachers fucking loved me. - Oh, you were one of those kids. Ah. I was quite popular. And what happened? Oh, what? Oh, what. Oh, I did, didn't I? Or is it because I called you vulnerable? Let me tell you something, right? My first proper game five years back... You're your own favorite subject. We was in Romania. It was my mate's first game, too. Away game in Romania. We were nervous as shit. Shh! And the ball comes to me at the edge of the box this high. And I had a choice then... ...whether to knock it out to my mate, or take the shot, 30 yards out. He was in a better position. I should have passed, I didn't. I hit it first time, bosh, top corner. Before I had time to blink, it had gone in, bang! Just like that. Goal of the season. What, so this is just a story about how great you are? No! You called me vulnerable, and I'm just saying, you got to take your chances where they come 'cause life ain't fair, and when it comes to it, there ain't no room for emotion. And how did your mate feel, the one that you didn't pass to? Mmm, never asked. Is he still your mate? Yo. Just, uh, put it on the side there, please, mate. What you looking at? Whoa. Come on. Show us what you got. Come on! Come on! Give us a private show. It's my night off. You were dancing in the club tonight. Well, that was work. I like to keep work and my private life separate. Oh. Yeah? I'm just going to go ahead powder my nose. Mm-hmm. A nice, long, hot one dedicated you. I'll show you mine if you show me yours. What? Your moves! Ah! All right. Yeah, baby. Yeah, you like? - Mm-hmm, there's plenty more where that came from. - Go on, then. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah. You know, I'd say you'd better call emergency services - 'cause some of these are dangerous. - You nearly took me eye out. There's, uh, this, uh... There's this. There's this. There's this. What's this, what's this cheeky little fellow? What's he doing, eh? He's on fire. The boy is on fire. What is that, Lord of the Dance? You are in the presence of something special here. Ah, yeah, special's the word. That routine you did at the club tonight, that was impressive. Yeah, well, it's harder than people think. Or kicking a ball? - Do you like that? - Just there. Show us your tits. Slow down, man. Take it off. Come on, take it off. Come on, take it off. I said, take it off. I said, take it off. Come on. Sorry. Sorry. I can't do this. Can't do what? This. I can't do this. I'm just... Is this what you're after? Can I have my bag, please? I'm... I'm just going to go. No, you don't. Just give us me bag. Well, it's got me stuff. Lipstick, tissues. What. Yeah, what else? There might be a bit of fluff and a tampon, I'm not sure. And the camera? Mm-hmm. There's a camera on my phone, if that's what you're talking about. Mm-hmm. What are you doing? - Right, I'm calling the police. - No, you ain't calling no one. I'm calling them. You paranoid bastard. Good. We'll have a chat with them about this and all, shall we? Fuck. It wasn't my idea. They approached me. I've never done this before, all right? I'm not that sort of person. Oh, yeah. Well, apparently you are. Look, I thought I could do it, but I was wrong, all right? Just... Just give us me keys and me purse. I'm... I'm just going to go. You can't go. Why can't I? 'Cause of what you signed, darlin'. What? How do you know what I signed or I didn't sign? Did you know about this? What, do you... Do you think I'm fucking stupid? Of course, I know. Are you saying that you planned this? What the fuck is going on, 'cause this is... Why would you... Why would you film yourself cheating on your wife? Was this... Was this a dare? Or some way of proving that you're a... A man or... Ah... Let's have a drink. I got the mood wrong. You know, I misjudged things. Come on, let's have a drink. I was just talking sexy, you know, I was talking a bit dirty. I was trying to get you into it. Thought you'd be into it. That's all. It was just sexy talk. I didn't mean nothing. I thought you'd like it, but you didn't. I got the mood wrong, so let's just... Look, let's just take it nice and slow. You think we're still going to do this? Well, why not? Why not? It'll be a laugh. Yeah. What, making a sex tape and selling it to the papers, what, that's a laugh for you, is it? What, that's a fucking weekend for you? Do you know what? - No, you don't. - I've had enough. - No, no. - You put your hands on me, - and I'll scream my fucking head off! - Keep your voice down. Don't tell me to keep my voice down. Fine, but let's just keep our fucking heads, all right? Let's talk like mature fucking adults. Is that what you think we are? I want to know what's going on. - Just sit yourself down. - I don't want to sit down! Oh, my fucking God. Lyndsey, darling, I'm gathering my thoughts, all right? I can't think with all this fucking hoopla. I'm gathering my thoughts. Jesus. Look. It's nothing. Some... Some little dickhead's shooting his mouth off telling stories. It's just fucking bullshit. It doesn't matter what's bullshit, because it ain't true. Well, if it doesn't matter, why you doing this? Because he's telling stories. Well, what kind of stories? Look, uh, this is what I am trying to explain to you, if you'd just listen. It doesn't matter what kind of stories, because they ain't true. What kind of stories? Look... I'm having trouble with my wife. That's all you need to know. And this is your way of solving it? Who is advising you, Russell fucking Brand? Look, we ain't together no more. Okay? We ain't together no more, and people don't know yet, and she's trying to stop me seeing my kids. And these kinds of rumors are exactly the thing I don't need right now. What kind of rumors? Oh, my God. What? You're gay! That's what this is, that's what this fella's been saying, isn't it? "Gay." Are you out your fucking mind? "Gay"? Of course, I'm not gay. Look at me. I'm a footballer. Oh, yeah, yeah, 'cause it's such a man's game. All of them buff lads together and no one ever fancies a fuck? What, are you monks? Don't know what you're talking about. That's why you're always doubling up with girls, isn't it? Even the straight lads can't get a hard-on without another fuckin' fella in the room. People rely on me. I got responsibilities. - People expect things. - And what's that got to do with being gay? I got fans. I got a family. I'm a fucking role model. "A role model"? Little kids have posters of me on their wall. Grown men and women buy fucking shirts, key rings, mouse mats with my name on. Men get razor blades because they're the ones I use. Japanese people drink the same whiskey as me, and it's all because of the kind of man I am. So if you think I'm just going to rock up to Mardi Gras - with fucking feathers falling out of my arse... - Oh, yeah. 'Cause that's what happens. ...and the next day play football in front of 70,000 fans, you're in cloud fucking cuckoo land, darling. Oh, my God. 'Cause I ain't gay. Gay ain't even an option. Jesus Christ, Jason, what year do you think this is? What year? It's fucking 1966 out there, darling, hmm? It's fucking 1066. You know what? I worked hard for this. I sweated blood, so if you think I'm just going to give it up 'cause some scratchy little cunt is shooting his mouth off, trying to make a few quid, fuck off! Do you know what? Maybe I will sit down. No, you stay on your feet! Do you... Do you think it's just me, hmm? Do you think people are truthful? The whole world is full of people pretending to be something they're not. The fuck I do or don't do with my life is up to me, right? No one else decides, so if I say, "I ain't gay," I ain't gay. The only thing that matters is what I do on the pitch. So, if there are things I need to get my head in the right place, if I need a wife and kid, yeah, if I need to fuck a woman, or a man, you know what, or a fucking apricot, for that matter, then that's what I do. Look... Let's just do this, huh? Let's just do it. You'll get your money. Everyone's happy. Yeah, it's just that, um... I'm just not sure I want to anymore, do you know what I mean? You know what? Fuck off, as if you've got a choice. You don't know the first thing about me. You don't know what I need or what don't need. So don't tell me what I can or I can't do. 'Cause you're not the one that gets to fucking decide. Look, do you want this fucking money or not? Nah. I want double what we agreed. Okay. All right. Double it is. We'll have to, um, reset it. It's got us talking on it. Have you done this before? Yeah. They were supposed to find someone who had done it before. I told them I'd done it before. Because they wanted someone who'd done it before. You're not getting me. This isn't me. I'm playing a role, but you'd know all about that, wouldn't you? - Just make it look good, all right? - Oh, don't worry, I will. Who is he? Who are you thinking about? Because I can tell by looking in your eyes it isn't me, is it? Come here, you cunt. Good to see you, man. You haven't changed. Look at you. Well, apart from that. What is that? This? It's what a man looks like. Yeah. Come in. Drink? Got a nice Sancerre on the go. Yeah. Nice Sancerre sounds, uh... Saw your website for your company. Some lovely testimonials. "Excellent finish." - Yeah. - That was Jojo and his missus. It's all right, innit? I got so much respect for you, Ade. Thanks. What do you reckon? - Yeah, man, it's good. Mmm. - Yeah. Plenty more where that came from. Where's all your stuff? Mmm, everything's in storage. Karen got our place, just for the kids, really. - Yeah, I was sorry to hear that, man. - Yeah. Check this out. Bosh! So do you get to see 'em, the kids? Um, well, you know, it's tricky, that. I don't want to confuse 'em. You've seen the tape? Well, I didn't watch it, but... Expensive 12 minutes that was. If I'd known how popular it'd be, I'd have drawn it out, turned it into a box set. Um, pass us them pills, will ya? Chop, chop. Seeing as you're up, uh, fetch us a beer. The fridge is just there. What did your last slave die of? AIDS. AIDS. They're, uh... They're for my knee. - I'm so used to them now, I forget. - Mmm. Do you still play? I turn up. Marshes. Hackney Marshes! Pitches still shit? Yes. I bet you're like Ronaldo with that lot. I am quite good, actually. Ah! "Ronaldo of the Marshes." My old man used to play there. Yeah. Read about it. Sorry, man. I didn't mind him skimming a bit, you know, it's my dad. But it got silly. I had the taxman onto me. Oh, you know, he's got his golf. Two hundred years old, that. Belonged to Napoleon. How's your knee? I heard you had keyhole. Arthroscopy. Pretty standard op these days. I ain't the same over five yards, but got it up here. I had it booked in a year back, but they brought that Sierra Leone kid in. I thought, "Can't take time off now, I'd lose my place." But after that sending off, thought, "Missing the end of season, may as well get it sorted." Five-match ban. That was pretty serious, man. Cunt had it coming. Pretty bad tackle, man. Giving it that all game and just... Ah... My mum was a bit shocked, to be honest, you know? My concentration. My time away, it's done me good. Go on, then, you're on. Oh! See if you can beat my time. Hotel not got a gym? Oh... I can't be done with the hassle, sweating away, someone wants an autograph for his nephew every two seconds. Makes a good training base. Room service. Chef here's got two stars. They got a 20-meter pool, too. I got me own key. I use it in the middle of the night when it's quiet. The amount of energy drinks I'm on with this training regime, I'm up half the night. Painkillers don't help. My clock is all wonky. I don't know if it's fucking night or fucking day. 1k every day. Good boy! Do you do tumble turns? Proper turns, like on the Olympics. It's quite fun, this. See that dot? That's you. See the other dot? Uh-huh. That's me. Ah. Well, you'll mess your nice shirt up. Oh. Paul Smith, woo! Fuck off. Jojo says you're out of contract. - Says you're looking for a club. - Yeah. I'm having a bit of a stocktake. Ah. Something about a club in India? Super League. That's where the money is. They're setting up the infrastructure, getting players in. Well, good enough for Del Piero. End of his career. You're getting old, is it? You sound out of breath, mate. Don't have a heart attack on me. You're worried about them young pups taking your place. Mmm. Got ten seconds to catch me up. Mmm. Harder than it looks, innit? So, what's this job, then? Oh. Jojo's missus is dead impressed. I ain't heard the end of her walk-in shower. Here it is. You have to use your finger. Otherwise, it doesn't... - Yeah, I have got one. - That's one of the new ones. Need some water, man. Oh, yeah, I'll put some tonic in. Tonic, man. Stop fannying about. This is what I'm on about. What do you reckon? It's nice. See? That's the terrace. South-facing, gets the sun all day. Right on the Med. Decent views. - All right, what do you want then? - Uh, whole thing, really. Well, I can, but, you know, I'm a plumber. I mean, you'd want to find someone local. Greece. Yeah, okay, Greece, yeah. There's a find-a-builder thing in Greece. You got to look on forums. Go online. Yeah. I thought it might be nice to do some work in the sun, be nice for you. Nice? It'll be like an oven, mate. Well, you can use it while you're out there. Have some mates out. Think of the parties. I'd visit. - Could have emailed this. - Well, it ain't as friendly, though. What you laughing at? That room in Romania. Do you remember? What made you think of that? Last time I saw you, pretty much. That was a mad night, wasn't it? Was it? No. Don't be a dick. There's only 100 bottles of this. I got the last case. - No, honestly. - We had that game the next day. The one I scored in. Thanks for reminding me. A lot's changed since then. Married. Divorced. Two kids. Jojo mentioned you were seeing someone. Gary. So, what's he like? He's all right. Yeah, he's good to me. Do you live together? No. I mean, well, we like our own space, you know? Oh, it's nothing funny. It's just, uh... Just the way it is. Do your teammates know about him from down the Marshes? Yeah, they're cool with it. I mean, there's some banter, but nothing... Does he go down the pub after the game? Beers with the lads? Yeah, sometimes. Do you hold hands? In the pub, I mean. Depends what pub. Yeah. - Mind if I, uh... - Yeah, do us one while you're at it. Uh... It's hard to meet people. You've got about a million followers on Twitter! Real people, you know? Mm-mmm. They have these parties that are exclusively for famous people and billionaires. You have to check your phone in at the door. You been to America? Never got round to it. Well, you should. It's got everything. Midwest, I adore the Midwest. You can drive for ten hours and not see a fucking soul. Where else does that happen, eh? There's nothing, just silence. Can hear your own heartbeat. About that night, er, I just want to clear the air, 'cause it's the kind of thing, if you don't talk about it, you put too much weight on it, you know? "Oh, this thing happened when we were kids." - Right. - You know, turn it into something it's not. I mean, when I got your text, I... Yeah, I mean, you could get all psychological on it, but... It was just shits and giggles, weren't it? Doughnut. Uh, it's getting late, man. I should, uh... Uh, no, you... You just got here. Yeah. I got work tomorrow. Nah. No, no, no. We should do something. What's up with you? Well, mark the occasion. - What, it's been eight, nine years? - Ten. Yeah, when was the last time you had a proper blowout like the old days? Come on! No. Tomorrow's another day. Tonight's me and you, mate. Go on! Let yourself off the leash. You're staying. You know you are. - You know you are. - All right. Shall we throw the telly out the window? Go on, then. Right, you get that end, I'll get the other end. Yep. One, two, three. Oh, mate. We're going to need a screwdriver. I'll ring down and get 'em to bring one up. What, "Can I borrow a screwdriver?" -I ain't going to tell 'em why. Am I? No, imagine if you did. - Shall I? - Yeah. - I'm gonna do it. - Yeah. I would like a screwdriver. Oh, no, uh, the tool. Yeah, I need to get the telly off the wall. Sweet. Yo! Good to see you, mate. Life has not been the same without you! Here we go, here we go. Come on! All right, mate, all right, all right, chill! Jesus! You know what? It's a shame you didn't do your badges. You could've gone into management. You'd have been good at that. Yeah, well, apparently, people don't like to take orders from a black man. I got a lot of respect for you, Ade. Working man like yourself. What's that got to do with anything? No, I'm just saying, you are a grafter. "A grafter"? Why are you being all... "You respect me." It means I respect you. Yeah, but why keep saying it? You said it twice now. Maybe it's because you're making me repeat myself. All this, "Be nice for you to work in the sun." What does that mean? Uh... Ade, we were having a laugh. Ade! I ain't making this up. Ade, why you so sad? Don't do that fucking voice, yeah? I don't like it. Are you pulling that card on me? Just don't. I don't like it. We ain't kids no more. Oh, talk about a sense of humor breakdown. Don't fucking get me started. Jesus, Ade, what is it you can't handle here? Huh, the booze, the pills, or the failure? Which one is it? No, no! I'm just curious. Come on. God, I'm sorry things didn't pan out, but it ain't my fault. That's what you think this is. Oh, what, what? You'd rather be fixing toilets than doing what I do? What, cooped up here like a nutter going for midnight swims? - Yes, I would. - Bullshit. You're jealous. Jase, no one gets to do the thing they dreamed about when they was a kid. That's life, mate. Except I do, Ade. I do. - 'Course I'd rather be playing professional. 'Course I... - Thank you! You're acting like you made some killer point. I'm a grown man. I moved on. - Mm-hmm, so why are you here, then? - 'Cause you asked me here. Oh, things must be going really well for you. Drop everything, drive 200 miles like that. Where does Gary think you are? Away on business? I am on business. You asked me for a quote. You just wanted a taste, didn't you, hmm? See how the other half lives, recapture the old glory. Feel a part of something, is that it? Think what you want. Oh, do you tell your teammates you played with me, hmm? You do, don't you? I bet they love it. I bet they buy you drinks. I bet you tell 'em all the stories, how you used to be someone, how you were this close, but it never happened because you didn't get the luck. That's right, I didn't get the luck. I was the better player and you know it. - That's right, Ade. You were the better player. - Thank you. Still, you managed to fuck it up. But that's you all over, innit? Not enough bottle, not enough heart. I didn't bottle it. I never had the chance. - You had your chance. You didn't take it. - You never passed me the ball. - Well, I didn't need to Ade. I scored. - I was in the better position. No, the better position's the one you score from. That was the position I was in. - You said you'd pass me the ball. - Well, it's not the playground. It don't work like that in the big boys' game. No, that was my only chance. I was subbed off after that. No, you were subbed off because, two minutes' later, you gave the ball away in our half, and they scored. I was taking the man on. Nine times out of ten, I'd have skinned him. I did it every time in training. We're all George Best in the back garden. All right. I made a bad choice. My mind wasn't in the right place. Why wasn't your mind in the right place? You know why. But we discussed this. I thought it was nothing. You keep telling yourself that all you want, but we both know what went on in that room. What? A hand job? The hand job I gave you when we were kids. You're harping on about a wank you had ten years ago? Ade, I'm sorry if you got confused. "Confused"? You're the one who got confused. All right. Okay, I'll tell you why I did what I did. I did it to get in your head, throw you off balance, make sure you weren't right for the game. Bullshit. I didn't have your pace or your first touch, but what I did have was this. I've always had it. It's an instinct to know what needs to be done and then do it. That is all. It wasn't the hand job I got confused about. Jesus fucking... What. It was the way you held me all night. Kissed me. Told me you loved me. Next morning, I got on the coach. I waited for you. When you stepped on, I looked up and I smiled at you. You just walked by. You didn't even look. Afterward, I tried talking to you, but you were with the other lads being a big man, 'cause you scored. Next week, squad list goes up, my name's not there, yours is. They don't renew my contract. Jase, I texted you, I left voicemails. Nothing. How could you do that? After everything that passed between us. I can't remember every detail, to be completely honest, Ade. A lot has changed since then. I have had other things to worry about the last ten years. Then why did you invite me here, Jase, if you've got so many other things going on? Just to see if you'd come back. Back where? To this room. -I never been here before. What you talking about? You just said "come back." This is the first time I've been here. I know. So what do you mean, you wanted to see if I'd come back? To see if you'd come back to... To me. Jase? Jase. Jase, you can't just leave it there. What'd you mean by that? Hey. This young man's brought our screwdriver. So, what do you want with this? We thought we might chuck the telly out the window. It's proper bolted on, mate. Seriously. You got no chance. You won't tell anyone, will you? Jason... We're in the middle of something here. - Yeah, I'd say. What's your name? - Harry. I'd say Harry was in the middle of something, wouldn't you? It's a pleasure to meet you, Harry. Oh, it's a pleasure to meet you, Jason. This is Ade. Say hello to Ade, Harry. You all right, Ade? Hello. Ade's shy. Oi. - Oh! - Jase, he's at work. It's all right. I clocked off ten minutes ago. Ah! Just take four, see how you get on. I'll have double, I reckon. By the looks of things, I'm playing catch-up. Ooh! Good man! So, hang on, if you've clocked off, how come you're still here? I'm always looking for the party, me. Oh! Do you hear that, Ade? Harry loves to party. Jase, we're talking about something here. Ade, we're having a laugh. Here, will you take a piccie for us? Oh, you won't put that online, will you? 'Course not. Come on, Ade, don't be a spoilsport. Oh, God... It's all right. I'll do a selfie. Fucking hell. Ooh. Yeah, one more. What you laughing at? When I was younger, that video of you and that lap dancer was a bit of a staple. I put it on once when I was shagging my girlfriend. I took a selfie of me and her watching you. Sent it to all my mates. We broke up soon after that. I hate girls who haven't got a sense of humor. Oh! It's important. - Yeah! - Mmm. Is that real? Mm. Really? Mmm. Am I the most famous person you've ever met? Uh, yeah? Fuck. Though I once met Jimmy Savile. He'd come to my school. They wouldn't invite him now, I don't reckon. - He's dead. - Yeah, and that. He's funny, isn't he? You... You're funny. Yeah. Yeah, I am, actually. What do you think we should do with Harry, Ade? Well, I'm up for anything, really. I mean, my mates say I've got no boundaries. I'm one of those people that can just drink and drink. And I don't get drunk. I don't even get hangovers. All right, you've had your fun. It's time Harry left, Jase. Either he's off, or I'm out. I'm not messing around. I don't care either way. Just make a decision. Oh. Well, it wouldn't be the first time you lost your nerve. What was that? Hmm? Don't think I don't know what you're doing. What am I doing? Ade, what am I doing, hmm? What am I doing? What the fuck am I... Do you know what I'm doing? I don't know what I'm doing. What am I doing, huh? What am I doing? Aha! What am I doing, Harry? I don't know! What am I doing? What, you think this is too much for me? Oh, what am I doing? What am I doing? What am I doing? You think I'm afraid of this? What am I doing, mate? What the fuck am I doing? - Ade! Ade! - Shut the fuck up! All right. Let's do this. Why don't we play a game? What's the game? Ooh! All in good time, Harry. All in good time. This is bonkers. Reminds me of this stag do I went on in Krakow, right? White water rafting in the morning, Auschwitz in the afternoon, back to the hotel for a shower, quick bite to eat, then on to a sex club. - Here. - Mmm, mmm. Cheers. And the best man, he got this prossie. Now, she sits the groom down on a chair, and does this full-on strip show down to her knickers, whipped cream on her tits and that, and then, I'm not lying... She unzips him, sprays some of the cream on his cock, and starts noshing him off like she's not had a hot dinner in weeks. His dad's there, his uncle, father of the bride, and we're all, like, shouting things. This is the best bit. Just as the groom's about to pop, and you can tell he's getting close 'cause his eyes are going like he's having an epi, this prossie shoves her hands into her pants, reaches back, and flops out the biggest cock you've ever seen. It's a fucking lady boy. We were like, "Where the fuck you stashing that?" 'Cause she had this tiny little thong on. Oh, and the fucking groom's face, though. He cried, actually. It went a bit dark. So what's the game, then? Forfeit or dare. - What's the forfeit? - You drink from the bucket. I ask you to do something, you don't wanna do it, you have to drink. All right, then. Take off your shirt. Oh. And your trousers. Oh. Yeah. That's right. That was easy. Go on, Ade. Do you see anything you fancy? Yeah. Let's have a go with this bucket, then. Oh. Go on, one more. Jase. Fucking hell, you boys play hard. Yeah. For a moment there, I thought you'd lost the plot a bit. Everything went dark, and then there was this bright light, and... Well, it was like what my Aunt Ada said happened when she had a heart attack and woke up and saw Jesus stood next to fucking Elton John. Right, I did it. I got a belter! This is for you. I dare you to kiss him with tongues. Boom! Yeah. Yeah, why not? Now, don't do anything you're not comfortable with, Ade. Look at you. All serious. I got a better idea. What is it? It's not my turn. -It doesn't matter. I think he likes you. - Yeah. - Fucking hell. - Go on. - I never kissed a fella before. Are you sure he wants to? He's got a right face on him. I don't think Ade knows what he wants. Or maybe he does. Now, get the fuck out. I said, get the fuck out! Get the fuck off me, you homo. I'll go when he says to go. He's right. Fuck off. Party's over. You were fun for five minutes. I'm bored now. You fucking pair of shit hounds. What am I, the warm. You know, no wonder you're a shit footballer these days. 'Cause every time you get one-on-one with the goalkeeper, you can't work out whether to put the ball in the net, or his dick in your mouth. Yeah, laugh it up, you queer bastard! It's about as funny as another man putting your kids to bed. Ow! Don't! Fucking weirdo! - Get up. - No, no, no. - No! - Get in! Get in! Jase! - Good boy, good boy. Good doggie. - Jase! Ah! Fucking psycho faggot! You think we don't know what goes on in here? Lads up and down the stairs all hours. You think we don't know? Oh, tell your friends, Harry, get some free drinks. Yeah, this is going on Twitter, mate. See how you like that. Harry, son, I got people for that. This goes on Twitter, I'll own your house and your nan's house, and your children's house, if you ever get that far. Now, off you trot, son. There's grown-ups talking. Do you reckon he was showing off? I don't think you're well. No? I'm tip-top, mate. I don't know what you're talking about. What am I here for? Truth be told, I was thinking of retraining as a plumber. Thought you could give me some tips. That's good, Jase. That's very good. The villa. I want you to have it. It's yours. You could live there. I could visit. We could look at the view. My, um... My knee's chalk. Ever seen a mountain crumble, fall into the sea? Could go anytime. Now that you need me, you want me to stay? You're the last thing I remember of any value. When I got your text, Jase, I had some notion... I can't. I'm sorry. I just can't. Well, it was only a suggestion. I don't know why you're making a thing of it. Do you know what I feel when I look at you? Is it pity? You mean you got the moral high ground, because you fix people's toilets for a living? I scored at the San Siro. Eighty thousand people rose to their feet. I inspire love, devotion. What do you get, Ade? Invoices? I love someone, and he loves me. Oh, yeah. Yeah. The great love affair with Gary. Don't tell me it doesn't eat away at you. "What if What if?" Look me in the eyes and tell me there aren't moments when you wouldn't give everything to live the way I do. Just what I thought. You haven't the nerve to live like I do, Ade. It would scare the shit out of you. Do you want to know why I never returned your calls? It's because I didn't want to be infected by your failure. - Well, at least I live in the real world. - Oh! I live in the same world you do, mate. Just better parts of it. You must be very happy, then. Please. Please, Ade... I don't know what to do! Did you really do it to get into my head, Jase? I don't know. Fuck.
