(children laughing) - See you tomorrow then? - Bye, Jane. - Bye Jane! - Bye, Bye! - See you at school, Jane. - See you tomorrow, bye. (gentle, melancholic instrumental music) - Miss! Miss Stuart! She took another turn this morning, for the worst. The ambulance come and got her. - Your grandmother is waiting outside, Miss Jane. You'll be living with her now, at least until your mother comes out of the hospital. - I'll be needing the key back, Miss. (horn beeps) (gentle, melancholic instrumental music) - Come and kiss your poor grandmother. Don't dawdle. (melancholic instrumental music) No wonder your mother succumbed to polio, living in a neighborhood like this, trying to be so independent. She wouldn't listen to me. We must nurse her back to health now. Your situation is going to improve considerably, too, Jane Stuart. You have to be outfitted with a new uniform, as you'll be going to a private school now. There are legions of well-mannered girls to make new friends with at St. Agnes, and your cousin Phyllis will introduce you to all the right people. - [Jane] But what about my old friends, Grandmother? When can I see them? - You won't need your old friends any more, Jane. Your life will never be the same again. You understand? (melancholic instrumental music) (kids chattering) - [Man] Alice! - [Girl] Daddy, Daddy, you're home! - [Man] Hello, darling, how's my little girl? (kids chattering) - Oh, there you are, Jane. I found them, after all. Last term's notes on the French Revolution, dear. - [Jane] Oh, yes, thank you, Mrs. Stanley. - Have a good read, and cheer up. You'll adjust to St. Agnes in time. My girls always do. - [Jane] Yes, ma'am. (girls laughing) - I see Junky Jane has got extra work again. - Don't rub it in, I wish she weren't related to me. She and her mother are the skeletons in our closet. - It's so depressing when public school flotsam washes up at St. Agnes, Phyllis darling. I do feel embarrassed for you. - Pity her brain's not as big as her feet. - Perhaps we should check. - [Phyllis] Yes, what a good idea! Throw it to me. - Give it to me! - No! - [Student] Give it to me! (girls shouting) Run, run! - [Boy] Thanks, Jody, I'll see you later. - Watch out! - [Bully] Didn't they teach you to ride at that cheap school you went to? - Watch out for the cart! (shouting) (banging) (clucking) My boss is going to kill me, for crying out loud. - Give me a hand up, will you? - A good kick in the rear end's what I'd love to give ya! - Shut your face, you little brat. Don't speak to me in that tone of voice. - You got what you deserve, you dumb broad. - Jody Turner, where are you? Fighting and brawling like a turkey cock every time I turn me back. You're supposed to help with supper. Thankless little guttersnipe! Get in! - From now on, mind your own beeswax. I wish you weren't my cousin, either. - Don't give yourself airs, Junky Jane. You're just as vulgar as your friends. How typical of someone whose mother and father don't live together. - Of course they don't, my father's dead. - Oh, no, he's not. He's alive. - That's not true. He died when I was a baby. - Someone's certainly pulled the wool over your eyes. - Jane, your mother left your father when you were a baby. - What are you talking about? - There was some simply ghastly scandal, wasn't there? - [Phyllis] Mother wouldn't say exactly. - Shut up, it's not true! - Of course, if you hadn't been born, they wouldn't have had to lie about it. Such splendid dirty linin, Junky Jane. And you never said a word. Who'd have thought you had it in you? A dull little thing like you. (girls giggle) (girls shout) (fluttery, melancholic instrumental music) - [Jody] Them roses was mine. Them roses was mine. I ain't gonna work for that cow no more. Next time, I'll belt that cook in the kisser. - Can I help you? Can I help you? - Mrs. Bolwinn give me some roses to pitch out, and I kept them 'cause they were so pretty. Then the cook comes along, accuses me of stealing. - No. - She did, too, and then she stamped on them. Look it, every single blooming one of them. - Why would she do a thing like that? - She says I ain't fit to be seen in this frock, and if I don't get meself spruced up, she'll chuck me out. I work good and hard around here for my keep, I do. One of these days, I'm gonna run away for good. Then see how she likes her potatoes peeled. - Why don't you come over to my house? I've got lots of clean dresses. (upbeat instrumental music) - This ain't no boardinghouse, is it? - [Jane] What's your name? - [Jody] Josephine Turner, but everybody calls me Jody. - Mine's Jane Stuart. - Cook said it was Victoria. - No, it's Jane. My first name's Victoria after my grandmother, but I'm Jane. - I wish I could live here. I ain't had a new nothing in my whole life. I'm gonna run away and work as some cook's helper in some faraway country inn. You wanna come with me? - I'd love it. - Who's that then? - My mother. - She's a beauty, ain't she? You're a spitting image of her, you are. - Oh, she's much prettier than I am. - Honest, I means it. You're as pretty as she is any day. - She's in the hospital. I'm not allowed to see her, and I'm afraid she'll never come home. That's why I have to live here. - At least you got a ma. I ain't got no one. My folks been dead since I was a kid. - Victoria, I. Oh, I beg your pardon, I didn't realize you'd brought someone home from school. Well, aren't you going to introduce us? - Grandmother, I'd like you to meet Jody, from next door. Jody, this is my grandmother Mrs. Victoria Moore Kennedy, and my cousin Phyllis. - Why, I. The scullery girl? How dare you bring riffraff into this house! Get out of here at once, girl! - Jody! How could you do that to her? Jody! Jody! (melancholic instrumental music) Jody! Jody! Jody? - What you want? - Jody, I'm sorry. You can still keep the dress. - Thanks. I ain't riffraff, you know. I know I ain't like you, neither, and your people, but I ain't riffraff. My folks was respectable, and I work hard to pay my own way. - I know my grandmother seems horrible, but couldn't we be friends still, Jody? (gentle instrumental music) - All right. - Jane! Jane! Your grandma's fit to be tied. Come on in now, darling. - Coming! If Cook says anything to you about the dress, Jody, tell her to come and speak to Jane Stuart. (car rumbles) - Will you hurry up and finish the lesson, Jane? I'm tired of babysitting you. You can just fend for yourself from now on at St. Agnes. (horn honks) I shall tell Grandmother that you don't listen to a word I say, if you don't smarten up. I'm only doing this, you know, because Grandmother has promised me a trip to England next summer. Everyone in my class is simply dying to go abroad these days, but no one can afford it. Jane, are you listening to me? - Mother! - Come back here, Jane! You haven't finished the chap. Grandmother! - I wouldn't run like that if I were you, Victoria. I do not want you upsetting her. - Why didn't you tell me she was coming home? - The doctors weren't sure when they'd release her. She's still very frail, Victoria Jane. How she ever imagined she could earn a living all on her own with a child to take care of. - Glory be to God, Miss Robin! Oh, isn't that face the dearest sight? - It's good to have you home, Robin. - [Robin] Thank you, Gertrude. (dramatic instrumental music) - Mommy! Mommy, I missed you. - Gertrude, wrap that stole around your sister. Victoria Jane, you're squeezing your mother half to death. Mary, take her bags. Jane, run along now, finish your lessons. You're home now, precious, and we must do everything to help you regain your strength. Mustn't we, Gertrude? Come here. - [Robin] It's good to be home, Mother. - And I'm so looking forward to showing you off. You must lose that silly cane if you're going to be seen in public again. We have a wonderful trip to England planned for you, and a list of social functions-- - Oh, England would be a wonderful opportunity for Jane, too, Mother. (gentle instrumental music) - [Grandmother] Everything is going to be the way it used to be, before you met him. - It's quite reassuring to think of living here again after all this time, Gertrude. - I'm not surprised you decided to stay, really. I always warned you that you'd need more than looks to survive in this world. - Oh, take that apron off! I'm going to get it. - I want to help you, Mary. - If you're grandmother catches you helping me in here, she's going to refuse to touch a leaf of that salad. Off you go now, and greet your friends and relatives, Jane. - But I hate my relatives, Mary, especially Phyllis. They're such snobs. - Your cousin Phyllis is ladylike and well behaved. You would be wise to take note of her manners and be a little friendlier with her, Victoria Jane. - How lovely of you both to come. - Robin, come along, we must see Mother. - She doesn't look at all well, Aunt Florence. If you ask me, this is only the calm before the storm. - I can hardly disagree with you, dear. Victoria Kennedy has been covering up for that poor child for years. Still waters run deep in this house, to be sure. (guests chattering) (gentle piano music) - Mother's been so terribly generous, sending Jane to St. Agnes'. I certainly couldn't have afforded it. - Have you made many nice friends there, Jane? - Well, my history teacher Mrs. Stanley's been very nice. She's given me all her old notes on the French Revolution. - Oh, the Revolution, how nice. Tell me about it. - Good evening, Florence. - She probably doesn't even know the dates of the French Revolution. I told you, Grandmother, I have to hold her hand through everything. - It's all right, dear, put the tray down. Go see Mary in the kitchen. - Victoria Jane fancies herself a domestic, Florence, and I must say, I do not approve. - Mary, my father's ready for the toast. Well, Grandmother certainly won't be taking you to England with us this summer, when you can't even answer a simple history question. - How do you know? - Because you just made an idiot of yourself, and we all want to disown you, you know. Grandmother says you take after your father. It isn't any wonder Aunt Robin left him. - That's a lie. - I asked Father, and he said that it is so true that your father's alive. Apparently, he lives out on some island in the Maritimes. He's a writer, and he doesn't even have two cents to rub together. So there. (guests chattering) - Mommy, I have to speak to you, alone, please. - Whatever you have to say to your mother, you can say in front of all of is. - It's all right, dear, what is it? - Is my father still alive? - Jane-- - [Jane] Is he? - Yes, he is. (clanging) - [Mary] For the love of Mike, Miss Jane! - Oh, never mind, we're getting used to it. William, will you do the honors, please. Robin, sit down. All this folderol will only make the child sulky and emotional. - You're too hard on her, Mother. - Mother. I would like to take this opportunity to toast our dear sister's return to the nest. We've been on tenterhooks, obviously. The damn polio. I just want to say welcome home, dear sister, and this time, may it be home to stay. - [Family And Friends] Home to stay. (thunder rumbles) (sad instrumental music) - I'm sorry. Please, forgive me. - Victoria Jane, get up. How dare you humiliate your mother and myself in front of all those people. - We should never have lied to her in the first place. - We agreed it was best for everyone to forget. Who told you about your father? - Phyllis said you left him, and Agnes Ripley said it was all my fault. - No, of course it wasn't, dearest. It had nothing to do with you. - What happened then, what did he do? - He made your mother's life miserable. - It wasn't miserable. It was a wonderful life for a while. - She married him against my wishes, and lived to regret it. That's all you need to know. I don't want you ever to mention him again. As far as we are concerned, he is dead. - Mother. - Get to bed, child. We're all exhausted. - Why does she talk that way about him? - She doesn't really mean it, Jane. She just has some old-fashioned opinions about things. Oh, it won't always be this way, dear. It's just that it's Mother's house, and we just have to learn to live by her rules until things are better. - [Jane] Mommy, you're right. Don't cry, Mom, I'm sorry. (tender instrumental music) - I'll be all right in a minute, dear. It's just that it's hard to forget about someone like that, that's all. Perhaps we should never have married in the first place. Something irreparable happened. He was really in love with someone else. (banging) (melancholic instrumental music) (lightning cracks) (melancholic instrumental music) (tinkling instrumental music) - It's hard to forget someone like that. (tinkling instrumental music) (Jane gasps) - [Jane] Good morning, Mommy. - Good morning, dear. - [Jane] Mary and I made you a nice, healthy breakfast. - Oh, it looks marvelous, it really does look lovely, thank you. - [Gertrude] Good morning, Robin. - Here it is! At last, our invitation to the Simpsons at home. Everyone else has had theirs for days. You've got to put this invalid existence behind you. So many of the right people will be there. Ah, there's such a great deal of mail for you, darling. A letter from Mrs. Kirby about that frightful bazaar that she holds each fall. Plead illness, darling. Such a social climber. And the Hamiltons have asked you to Charlie's wedding at the Yacht Club. You have to invite an escort, of course. Yes, well, this one's for you, also. Would you like me to read it for you, Robin? - No, no, let me. - What is it, Mother? - What's wrong? - Sit down, Jane. - It's from your father. He says I have to send you to him. He's claiming his right. - Let me see it. What sheer audacity. After all these years. Call George Bowers at Eliot and Eliot, Mother. - Nothing will happen without my say so. I'm sure there's a perfectly rational way of dealing with this without lawyers. - We really have no case, Mother. Andrew Stuart has a perfectly legal right to see his own daughter whenever he wishes. After all, Robin abandoned him. - But to take her out of school. The man must be half crazed. - If you antagonize him, he could try to take her away from you altogether. - Folderol! He cares nothing for her. He's only trying to antagonize us. - I did suggest from the beginning, if you remember, that you consider divorce. - It's out of the question. - He could have asked for a lot more, you know. My professional recommendation is to let her go until Christmas. He'll lose interest once we've conceded the point. - Please, don't let them send me, Mother. - Go and listen to the radio in the study with Phyllis. - Figured out what that big dumb secret is they're hiding from you? - What exactly is a divorce? - Don't you know anything? It's when married people get unmarried. I suppose the French did it a lot during the Revolution. They're a difficult thing to get. It simply isn't done, you know. - [William] He could've asked for a lot more, you know, a lot more. - [Grandmother] That husband of yours destroys the lives of everyone around him. What happened to the Morrow woman proved fatal. - Regardless of what people say about Evelyn Morrow, nothing was ever proved against Andrew at the inquest. (gently dramatic instrumental music) - I have to stay with him til Christmas. I wish you could come with me. I'm afraid of my father. He must've done something terrible to make people hate him. - You should've put your foot down right away. Now look at the mess you're in. - Where is that girl? The train won't wait for her. - Victoria Jane! Jane! Jane! - Now don't you take no nonsense from anyone now, not even an ax murderer. - I'm delighted you could chaperone her to PEI and school, Blake. Well, do give my regards to your daughter, Mrs. Stanley. We wish great luck in her new teaching position. - Thank you, Mrs. Kennedy. - Get in the car, child, for heaven's sake. - [Mrs. Stanley] We'll go over all her studies on the train together. - We're quite relieved that at least Victoria Jane's education will be in good hands under your daughter's tutelage. Christmas will come soon enough. Don't think the train is going to wait for you. Goodbye now, Mrs. Stanley. - Goodbye, Mrs. Kennedy. (melancholic instrumental music) (banging) - Jody Turner, where are you? Jody Turner, you get in here out of that mud! It's lazy, good for nothing, churly brats like you that drive a decent woman to drink! (dramatic instrumental music) You get back here, Jody Turner, before I box your ears. - Stop! Stop! - Mind the horse, girl. - [Jody] Can you give me a lift to Union Station? (train whistle blares) (bell tolls) (exciting instrumental music) - [Conductor] All aboard! (upbeat instrumental music) All aboard! (upbeat instrumental music) - Hold on, hold on. Got a ticket, do you, girl? - Please, don't throw me off, Mister. - A runaway, eh? I oughta throw you off, learn you a lesson. - You don't understand. It's my granny, see? She's dying, and I'm about to see her for the last time in my entire life. - I have no time for sympathy. I'm putting you off at the next stop. Them's the rules. - I'm a good worker, I am. I'll work my way there. Any job and I'll do it. Gimme a chance, sir. I'll work for however long it takes me to to pay me way. - Well, egad. We are short staffed in the dining car. Can you wash dishes? - I was born washing dishes. - All right, all right, all right. You can work for your ticket, but the first time you slacks off, I'm throwing you off to the police, mind? - Thanks, sir. God bless you for letting me get to my dying granny. - All right, get along with ya. (melancholic instrumental music) - So, of course, I said to my daughter Cecily that if she thought this man Daniel Kent was the person she wanted to spend the rest of her life with, she should accept his marriage proposal. What wedding arrangements I got to make when I get there. Oh, you haven't eaten a bite. - I'm not very hungry, thank you, Mrs. Stanley. - There, there, it'll all turn out right in the end. - Don't you try nothing. Person has to wait til Christmas for clean dishes around here. - You cooks is me cross in life, honest to Pete. (delicate instrumental music) Jane! Blimey! - Hey, get back here! You can't just run off. - Bloody hell. - Your time ain't finished yet. - This is the connecting line to the island ferry. Oh, dear. - Now where are they off to? - Check with the bank. - Where'd that little brat go? - Who? - I turned my back for one minute and she's out the door! - [Conductor] Who, Jody? She must be around here somewhere. - [Cook] What are we gonna do, you gotta find her. - [Man] Hey, you, that's my bike. You little rascal, get back here. That's my bike! Thief, thief! - Look out! (horse whinnies) (crashing) - Arrest that girl, that kid stole my bike. She ruined my wheel. - Goodness, a child. - Quick, get her! Get her! - Jimminy! - [Cook] Quick! Quickly, get her! - [Cop] Get her before she gets underneath the train! (exciting instrumental music) - All right, all right, all right, I'll pay for the blooming bike! Only I ain't got no money. You'll have to give me a job, sir. God bless you for the rest of my life. Just don't throw me in the clink! - And how am I supposed to get back to the island, hmm? (dramatic instrumental music) - You can never rely on these boats. I hope your father isn't too impatient. Oh, we'll get to the island soon. (dramatic instrumental music) - Mother, Mother! - Yoo hoo! - So good to see you. - You look wonderful! - [Woman] Look who I met at the station, Mother. It's Irene Stuart. - Hello, Irene. Jane, I'd like you to meet my daughter Cecily. - Hello, Jane. - [Mrs. Stanley] And your Aunt Irene. - So this is our dear, little Victoria Jane. - Just Jane, if you please. - Of course, you dear, funny child, it can be Jane. Your father's dreadful car broke down, so I've come instead. - We have to be off, but I'm so looking forward to having you in my class, Jane. See you next week. - Goodbye, and thank you so again. - Goodbye, goodbye, Jane. Poor child. - We should be going, too. So your Grandmother Kennedy is good to you, isn't she, Janey? - Yes, very good. - What has she told you about your father? - I've never been allowed to discuss him. - Well, surely she must've said something about him. She never did care much for your father, you know. I thought she might take her spite out on you. You know, it was really she who made all the trouble between your parents. You're not at all like your mother. She was the prettiest little thing I ever saw. I've heard she's been ill, poor dear. She always was, well, frail, I suppose you could call it. Such a pity. Now, there's nothing wrong with your father's blood. I can vouch for that. I've always been more like a mother to him than a sister. - [Jane] When will I see my father? - [Irene] Your father will pick you up at my place tomorrow. - [Jane] Where is your place, Aunt Irene? - I suppose I shouldn't really call it my place, should I? It's just that I've lived for so long at the Morrows', I really feel I belong there. - The Morrows? - Surely you know who the Morrows are. Finest family on the island. They've always been very close to us. I first came here as secretary to old Mr. Morrow. His eldest daughter Evelyn and I, just like that. (dramatic instrumental music) Come along, my dear, Lillian's dying to meet you. - Is Lillian a Morrow, too? - Well, of course, my dear. She's Evelyn's younger sister. I'm her personal secretary and companion. There you are, Aggie. Would you take Miss Jane's bags up to the guestroom? To the guestroom. - Which guestroom would that be, Miss Stuart? Miss Lillian's or Miss Evelyn's? - Well, I suppose it will have to be Miss Evelyn's. The plumbing's still not fixed in Lillian's. Aggie's strong as an ox, just a bit deaf. Take your coat off, my dear. My, what a great mane of hair you have, dear. I can just tell how hard it must be to manage. - [Jane] Will Evelyn be here, too? - For heaven's sake, don't mention her name in front of Lillian. - [Jane] But they're sisters, aren't they? - Yes, but Evelyn's dead. Come. Lillian, dear, I do hope we're not too late for tea. The train was quite a bit behind schedule. - So this is Jane Stuart. You have the look of your father about you, Jane. - My, but she looks to me to be the image of her Grandmother Kennedy, Lillian. - Andrew and I have always been very good friends. I hope that we'll be able to continue that friendship. - Yes, I hope so. - Did you know, Lillian and Evelyn were the toast of the island in their day? Here they are as children. They were sweethearts of your father's. Lillian is still so attractive, don't you think? Thank you, Aggie. Come on, Jane. - Where does that door lead to? - To Evelyn's bedroom. I always keep it locked. This was her guestroom, you see. Nothing has been changed in there in the past 10 years. - What did she die of, Aunt Irene? - Her car was found at the bottom of the North Shore Cliffs. She must have lost her way in the blizzard that night, and she drove over the edge. Poor Evelyn. Ah, me. I should know better than to tire you. You must be exhausted. You can't imagine how happy I am to have Andrew's little girl, my only niece, near me at last. Good night, lovey. - [Jane] Good night, Aunt Irene. (tinkling instrumental music) - [Man] Evelyn! Evelyn, come back! - Come back! Come back! Come back! (wind whistles) (swirling instrumental music) - It's hard to forget someone like that. (tinkling instrumental music) (door creaks) - Aunt Irene? (door creaks) (wind moans) (haunting instrumental music) "Andrew Stuart and Evelyn Morrow "at the time of their engagement." (door slams) (tense instrumental music) - I see somebody picking at her breakfast. (car rumbles) - Aggie, would you get the door, please? - It's only your father, lovey. I'd recognize the sound of that old hearse of his any time. Don't be nervous, dear. You stay right here and I'll bring your father in to meet you. (dog barks) - [Jane] Get off, get away! - It's all right! He won't hurt you. He won't hurt you, he just loves people. Aggie, take him outside, will you? - Was that you screaming like a banshee, Jane? What the neighbors will think, I can't imagine. Well, aren't you going to kiss your father? Come on. Isn't she a daughter to be proud of? Fetch your things, Jane. We're leaving at once. - [Lillian] Andrew, won't you stay and have some coffee? - I'm afraid I can't, thanks, Lillian. I've decided to open up Lantern Hill. I want Jane to live with me there. - Lantern Hill? - Goodness, do you have enough food and supplies? - Don't trouble yourself. We'll pick up what we need on the road. - No trouble at all, won't take a minute. Aggie, give me some help. - Are you out of your mind? Why do you want to take her back there? - I can't keep a child cooped up in my apartment. Besides, it's close to Cecily Stanley's school. - And the local tongues will all be wagging if you go back, won't they? That part of your life is over, Andrew. Just let it go, think about the future. - Let me manage my own life, Irene. - You've made such a success of it so far. - Mind your own business. I intend to handle this in my own way, Irene, alone. There's no need for you to come along. - She's got a secretive strain in her I don't like. Old Mrs. Kennedy will never be dead while Jane is alive. - Knows how to hold her tongue, is that it? - More than that, she's... If there's anything else you need, well, you let us know, Drew. (dog barks) - I made your favorite, fresh water crescent tomato, and peanut butter for Jane. She hardly touched her breakfast. And there's some fresh milk and staples. - Thanks, Lilly. You're always so thoughtful. - You be careful of the poison ivy, dear, and the mice. Don't let that rundown old house depress you, Jane! We can always come and rescue you. (upbeat instrumental music) - I bought you some toffee, here. (upbeat instrumental music) What have they told you about me? - Nobody will tell me anything. - I see. Well, we're neither of us much for talking. I'd rather people left me alone, too. (car rumbles) Grab the wheel! For Pete's sake, grab the wheel! (comical instrumental music) Gas it! Gas it! (car rumbles) That a girl! - [Jane] The brakes don't work! - They retired months ago. Move over. Move over! (upbeat instrumental music) (Jane shouts) (splashing) That's a good boy. (dog barks) It's all right. You're safe now. (birds cry) There's Lantern Hill. (birds cry) (upbeat instrumental music) - [Jane] Why did you send for me now? - I felt compelled to know who you are, Janey. I can't explain why I sent for you. It doesn't matter what you've been told about me. I felt you needed to make up your own mind. Well, the old place has magic in it. You can see the sea, it's just over the hilltop there. What a darn fool, I forgot the key. I think the easiest thing to do would be if you went in through that little window. (upbeat instrumental music) Pull hard. Now, good, can you squeeze in? All right in there? Go downstairs and open up the door. There should be a key beside it. I'll be along, you go on in. I think I've got to go back to Bright River, see if I can get someone to help me budge the car. (birds cry) I'll leave the dog. - All right. (delicate instrumental music) Mommy. (gentle instrumental music) Evelyn. (clanging) (cow moos) - [Boy] Hey, there's somebody at Lantern Hill! - [Boy] Keep away from there, that place is bad luck! - [Boy] I'm gonna go see who it is. - [Boy] Come on, Jimmy-John, let's go. Old Man Stuart's liable to push you over the cliff. - [Jimmy-John] Hey, you girl, come out here. - Come on, Jimmy-John, let's go! (birds cry) - Jane? I'm sorry I was gone so long. The car is still stuck. I've got a tow truck coming in the morning. You've got this place looking exactly as I remember it. Do you remember this place, Jane? The old clock's still working. This is a superior job, Jane. Look what you've been making, cookies. - I like to cook. - Well, that's marvelous, I can't cook at all. You didn't want to come here, Jane. (sighs) I heard your mother was ill. How is she? - She's all right now. She nearly died, though. - Did she want you to come? - No. - Come with me, there's something I want to show you. You've known the sea before, Jane. You were born beside it. Now you've come home. (birds cry) (bell tolls) (kids chatter) - Owen Meade stop that. Leave your brother alone. All right, class, now I want everyone to take their seats and settle down. Shirley Alastair. Hello, Mr. Stuart, good morning. - Good morning. - Thank you for bringing Jane. Class, I would like to introduce you to Jane Stuart, a student of my mother's from Toronto. She's to spend time with us while she's living here at Lantern Hill with her father. Jane, you may be seated here. - Bye. - Goodbye, Mr. Stuart. I hope you'll become best friends with everyone in the class during your stay, Jane. - Did you see the new girl? - There she is, there she is. The new girl, there she is, there she is. - [Student] I don't like her skirt. (girls laugh) - [Jimmy-John] Hey, you. - What do you want? - Is it true your pa's a writer and all? - He's a journalist. - Does he put live people in his stories then? - I suppose so. - Owen's scared he'll put him in one. He says you live in a marble house in Toronto. - Well, we don't. - Do you have satin bedspreads? He says you do. - No. (Owen shouts) - Hey, lay off of me, Owen! - Ah, come on, Jimmy-John, you can't be lollygagging with a witless girl, her parents divorced and all. - They are not divorced. Leave me alone. - Now see what you've done. She'll tell her pa and he'll put you in one of his stories about dead people. - Go and do your chores, Jimmy-John, before you have my boot in your mouth for supper. - She don't even have satin bedspreads. You're a liar! (gentle instrumental music) - Hey, you, watch out you don't slip. That cove down there, that's where Evelyn Morrow's car was found. - So? - He was with her the night she was killed. Didn't your pa tell you? How he pushed the car over the cliff, with her in it? Her ghost's been seen walking these cliffs, you know? Did he tell you that? Ghosts don't rest until their wrongs are put right, you know. So you just better watch out that she don't push you over. That would be a great way at getting back at your pa. (Owen laughs) (swirling instrumental music) - And how is school? Have you made lots of new friends? - Mrs. Stanley's daughter's very nice. - And what about the children in your class? Have you gotten to know them? - People around here aren't very friendly, Aunt Irene. - Don't be silly, dearest. You must be imagining things. You just haven't gotten used to things here. I can tell. Oh, I see Andrew's found Lillian. Oh, and Dr. Arnett. He delivered you, Jane. Your father and Lillian make such a handsome couple. (dog barks) Well, let's call them to dinner, shall we? - I'm very impressed with your culinary talents, Miss Stuart. How'd you learn all this? - When Mother was working, I made all the meals and looked after the apartment. - Yes, you're wonderfully able, dear. But you have given her too much responsibility, Drew. - She's a very capable girl. She even helped me drive the car the other day when the brake conked out. - Right into the pond. Well, just as long as you don't let her drive it along the North Shore Cliffs. - Oh, come on, Doc, let's go for a walk. I rarely get a chance to enjoy North Shore twilight, Andrew. Come on, Jane. - [Jane] I'll be along later. - What great chums they've been all these years. Lillian's been so supportive of your father. Too many memories in this gloomy place, though. - Dad said we're gonna fix it up, the way it was when you were young. - I'm sure he will, Janey. Let me borrow an old apron and help you tidy up. (gentle instrumental music) We shall look forward to seeing you and Daniel at your engagement party. - [Cecily] Oh, yes. - Oh, there she is. Jane! Jane, darling, I haven't seen you all week. Come along, I'll give you a ride. Come on. Lillian and I are hoping to coax Andrew into going. Good luck again, dear. - All right. - It was lovely talking to you. - I'll see you next week. - Bye bye. - Bye bye. (car rumbles) - We know it's only been three weeks of school, but I understand from Cecily Stanley, you haven't fit in very well with the others in your class. It's just that people around here find it awkward that your parents are separated. You know, you don't have to stay here if you're not happy. I could speak to your father and explain. I think it's selfish of him, bringing you all this way just to settle a guilty conscience. Oh, he was probably hoping for some kind of family reconciliation, after all these years. - [Worker] Throw the baggage over, Jody. (train whistle blares) - I won't be a moment, lovey. I'm just going to pick up the mail. - Jane, Jane! - Jody! - Jane! I've been looking for you everywhere! Only, I couldn't remember your dad's last name. - It's Stuart, Andrew Stuart. We live at Lantern Hill, a farm on the North Shore. - Don't worry, I'll find ya! - Who is that kid? - She's my friend. I'm living in Bright River with Jim the Post. - Come along, Jane, we can leave now. - Thanks for the ride. I can get home on my own, it's not far. Sorry. - Jane, Jane Stuart! Jane Stuart, come back here! For heaven's sake. (dog barks) - It's Aunt Irene. - No, she never said anything to me. All right. Irene just told me that you as much as said you wanted to go home this afternoon, and that you deliberately jumped out of her car and tried to get away by running after a train. - No, that's not it at all. - What's got into you, Jane? If you don't wanna stay away, I won't hold you. Irene has offered to drive you to the station tomorrow. - No, she asked me things, that's all. I didn't know what to say. She wants me to go home. - That's ridiculous. - She acted as though it was my fault, the way the other kids look at me, tell me how strange I am 'cause you and Mom don't live together anymore. - You mustn't believe every passing remark your Aunt Irene makes. She does these things deliberately. I never should've brought you back here, Jane. I'm sorry. She's always interfering, and I intend to talk to her about it. (dog barks) - What did I do, Doc? - Don't take it to heart, Jane. I've known your father a long time, and I know how happy he is you've been able to come back. Andrew, can I get a lift back into town? - You better jump in quick. (car rumbles) - Psst, hey, you, Miss Stuck-up. - You know my name's Jane. - Well, you better come quick, Jane. Owen's gone and made a bet with the Titus sisters about you. - What kind of a bet? - He says you're 14 if you're a day, and they say, no, you can't be, you're only 12. - Well, I am 12. Now go away and leave me alone. - That's the point, can you prove it? They got 25 cents in a pickle jar, and I'm betting with them against Owen. - What do people think I am anyway? Of course I can prove it. (upbeat instrumental music) How can they know my age? I don't even know who they are. - Hepzibah told them. - Who's Hepzibah? - She's special, that one. It's her house the Titus sisters live in, see? They take care of her, but the ways I's sees it, she really looks after them. (gentle instrumental music) - Can this really be Andrew Stuart's little girl, sister? - She doesn't look all bad now, does she? - Shocking pale, though, wouldn't you say? - Come up, Jane Stuart. I've been waiting for ya. - Are you Hepzibah? - She's 12 and she can prove it. - Keep quiet, Jimmy-John. - Let me go! - Let me see your eyes, girl. - [Sister] I prefer blue eyes myself. - Not my taste. I only admire green eyes. - What about my 25 cents? - It ain't yours yet, Jimmy-John. She ain't proved nothing. - Open the Bible, child. Show them your age. - [Jane] Look, I was born in 1923. - See, I win, I win! - Come back here, Jimmy-John! - Come up, Jane. Well, and now we can have our cranberry tea in peace. Your mother's recovering nicely, dear. She'll be back in the island in no time. - But what do you mean? - I said a prayer for her, regular like this spring. - Did you know my mother well? - All the time she lived here. I used to take butter and eggs down to her at Lantern Hill. She loved that place, she did. She trusted me. I was there, helping her, the night you were born. - [Sister] There's only been two divorces on PEI in the past 60 years. - [Sister] I know, they are not divorced. - Nonsense, it was all Evelyn's doing. - Are you talking about Evelyn Morrow? - [Sister] Well, of course she's talking about Evelyn Morrow. - A temper like a volcano, that one. Self-centered, spoiled. She and Irene Stuart were like two peas in a pod. - Whatever anyone says, she loved your father. - My father? - Why, of course, they were engaged. - Irene was in heaven, absolute heaven. - She was mad determined to have him marry into the Morrow family. It was her goal in life, always craving to be accepted. She thought, with him married to either of the Morrow girls, it would do it for her. - Only, it was a fool's paradise, don't you see? He went off to war-- - Stop interrupting, Violet! - I'm not the one interrupting. No sooner back than your dear mother comes along, vacationing in that big hotel on the North Shore. - Your father and mother fell in love, hook, line, and sinker, don't you see? They eloped. - Evelyn would never have suited him anyway. She was far too selfish. - And that two-faced Irene. Sweet poison, that one. You'd have thought Andrew Stuart never wanted children the way Irene went on about it. - She did everything to wreck that marriage and influence Andrew, to be sure. Irene might have had her way if the baby hadn't come along and spoiled her plan. - You mean me? - That tongue of yours is hinged in the middle, sister. - What she means, dear, is, well, that Irene was always hinting, don't you know, that they weren't ready for children. - But what she really hoped was that the marriage wouldn't last, you see-- - Violet! - And that what? - And that your father might-- - Find happiness again. - With Evelyn. - What do you mean? (wind whistles) Hepzibah. (sinuous instrumental music) (crows caw) (owl hoots) (soft instrumental music) (wind whistles) (tinkling instrumental music) (crow caws) (tense instrumental music) There's something out there, I saw it. I was lost and something brought me back here. - Now, now. Your father's on his way. There now. You mustn't be frightened. I want to talk to you. What is it, child? - Did they really not want me? - I told you I was there that night you were born. I've been watching you all your life. Your mother and dad were the happiest couple on all the island. - Why didn't they stay together? - It wasn't for lack of love, that's for sure. Crazy about each other they were, and about you, too. - Then Dad didn't love Evelyn. - No, that was a boyhood thing. Irene pushed him into it. - Why did Mom leave? - They let other people interfere. They give in. So they did, without a fight. That's why I sent for you. But Evelyn needs help, too. - But Evelyn's dead. - Sometimes a troubled soul needs to make peace with itself. - What I saw in the woods looked like Evelyn. Owen said Dad pushed Evelyn's car over the cliff. Do you think Dad would ever do that? - Oh, now, you don't believe that, do you? Why, he wouldn't squash the tick that bit him, more's the pity. No, it's not his fault. There's things here that needs putting to rights. Sometimes, there's no knowing why a bird will foul its own nest. Happens in families, too. Only, when it happens, it takes a bit of spit and spark to clean things up. And, sometimes, a few honesty spoken. And you're the only one who can help your family now. But, first, you gotta decide what it is you want, and then you have to fight for it. - Can you help me? - Let me hear you say it out loud, child. Tell me what you want. - My mother and my father and me together. (tender instrumental music) (car rumbles) (wind whistles) (knocking) - Good evening, Hepzibah, have you seen my little girl? She's 12 years old. You remember her, don't you? She's staying with me now at Lantern Hill but I'm afraid she's run away. Jane? I've been looking everywhere. What are you doing here? - It got all misty and foggy. I couldn't see properly. - Now you mind what I say, Jane Stuart. If you need help, you come back to me. And don't you pay any heed to any more gossip. Gossip makes geese, that's what I say. - Hepzibah. What are you doing with this? - [Jane] Well, Jimmy-John and-- - How long have you been here? And what's all this about gossip? - Jimmy-John brought me over for a visit, and the Tituses started talking, and I love you, Dad. (tender instrumental music) - I love you, too, Jane. And I'm sorry I was so upset tonight. But I've spoken to Irene, and she says she's sorry, she made a mistake. Don't ever think I never cared for you, Jane. - I don't ever wanna leave. - I don't want you to leave, either. Let's just make the best of the time we have together. (car rumbles) (tender instrumental music) (wind whistles) - I've come for Jane of Lantern Hill! - [Jane] Jody! What's wrong with the door? - I wasn't sure I'd get a welcome from your dad. - [Jane] Oh, he wouldn't mind. - Are they treating you fairly? - Well, his wife fancies adopting me. She don't got no kids. The post office is making me work for him til I pay him for the broken bike. I don't want no trouble. (clock chimes) Criminy, I've gotta get this flipping bike back. Him and his precious bike. You'd think he's got the bloody crown jewels under his bum instead of a plain, ordinary two-wheeler. - Couldn't you stay here, with us? - Thanks, can't, though. Railway's got me in a contract with Jim. - You know where we live now, Jody. Come back and see us anytime. - Thanks, sir, but I've always looked after me self. - I'll be back in an hour. (rooster crows) So that's the whole story, Jody. - [Jody] Blimey, what a mess. - Maybe Mother decided she didn't love him. You think so, Jody? - You can't go marrying someone unless you love them. That just ain't the way it's done. Least ways, not in the movies. - Well, maybe she stopped loving him because Grandmother ordered her to. - Would you stop loving your dad because your gran made you? - Well, no, now that she's living with Grandmother again, she can't stand up to her. (cows moo) Quick, climb up on the fence! - What for? It's only cows, Jane. - Come on! (Jody moos) Stop it, Jody! - If you won't stand up to a bunch of cows, you can't go blaming your mom for not standing up to your gran. Don't let everyone boss you around the way they do. Give some people an inch, they'll take a blooming mile, you know. (Jody moos) - Hey, leave them cows alone! - Says who? I'll poke your eye out, spotty face. You heard me. On your way, bossy. (Jody moos) (horn blares) - Jane. Jane. I couldn't get through on the phone. - [Jane] Dad takes it off the hook when he's working. - Lillian's Great-Great Aunt Frida Morrow just passed away. We'll need Andrew to come with us overnight to Fredericton. Men can be so helpful at times like this. Tell your father to meet us in town in an hour. - Was her aunt a friend of Dad's? - Well, not exactly, but I'd like him to come for Lillian's sake. - You're always hinting at things, Aunt Irene. Why can't you just come right out and say what you mean? - I beg your pardon. If it weren't for you-- - And if it weren't for her what, rubberneck? A troublemaker, that's what you are. - How dare you talk like that to me. Who is this pest? - No pesty than you are. Trying to cause trouble between her mom and dad, hoping he'd marry your precious Evelyn Morrow. - What are you talking about? You don't know the first thing about Evelyn Morrow. - All I know is that she drove like a flipping disaster, right over the cliff. - I shall see your father gets the message myself, Miss Jane Stuart! - [Jane] Aunt Irene, I didn't think-- - I haven't time to waste with guttersnipes. - And I don't much like talking to busybodies, neither! So there, Miss Nosy Parker! - Jody! - Well, that's what she is, parking her big nose all over other people's business. Off to Fredericton, huh. I wouldn't put it past that old bag to try to marry him off to that Lillian. She's so lovey-dovey with them Morrows. (laughing) Sure enough touchy about that Evelyn, eh? - I'd give my eyeteeth to know more about who she really was. - Why don't you go look in her room, dopey? Didn't you tell me Irene keeps it like some kind of museum? - We couldn't. - Why not? They'll all be with dopey dead Auntie Frida in Fridatown tonight. We'll have the place to ourselves. (cow moos) - If you hardly knew her, I don't see why you even have to go. - I'm going because of Lillian. When the chips were down, she stuck by me. The least I can do is be a friend to her. I'll leave the dog. You be good now. I'll see you tomorrow. (gentle instrumental music) - [Jane] I'm worried Dad won't stand up to Aunt Irene. - Oh, never mind. Maybe we can find out what really happened to her. See, I told you we'd get in. - This is silly, Jody. The door to Evelyn's room is always locked. - This place give me the willies good and proper. Oh boy, oh boy, oh boy, oh boy. - [Jane] Aggie's deaf. - Look! - [Jane] It's Evelyn's room. - It's open. (tinkling instrumental music) Proper glam, ain't it? Come have a bounce. What's up? - It's Evelyn. See? Look how sad her eyes are. - This is a museum. Hey, look at all this junk. She kept all of Evelyn's blooming clothes and everything. How do I look? Hey. A letter. To Mrs. Andrew Stuart. - Give it to me. It's from Evelyn. She must have torn up their engagement photo. - Come on. Read it out loud. - "Dear Robin, "how can I face either of you again after today? "What I said to you was a lie. "I know now I mean nothing to Andrew. "I should never have listened to Irene. "She tried to make me believe "something that doesn't exist anymore. "It's over. "Forgive me." - Blimey. I bet you it weren't no accident. She drove over that cliff on purpose. I bet she's done herself in. It's just like in the movies. - Irene must have hidden the letter all those years. - Trying to save her own bleeding neck, just hoping your ma would leave. - She might not have left him if she'd known the truth. - Well, I gotta go. Don't let that letter out of your sight. (train whistle blares) - There you are. Come on in, why don't you? You little maggot. I warned you not to break my bike again. - I only borrowed the bike, Jim, I didn't break it! Leave me alone! (Jim groans) - [Jim] Get the police after you. Lock you up forever. (banging) - [Jane] Jody! Let me in! - Get away with you, girl, go on, get off. Do you want him after you, too? - [Jane] What happened to Jody? What have you done to her? You let her go! You can't keep her! - She belongs to us now. She's been making trouble. We can do whatever we pleases. Now get away! (wind whistles) (mournful instrumental music) - Evelyn! Evelyn! (wind whistles) - Dad! (wind whistles) Dad! (banging) (wind whistles) (eerie instrumental music) Does Evelyn want me to keep it? - Show the letter to your father. He's ready to see what Irene has done. But it's him must speak the truth now, if he's to win her back. Now, you stand fast, hmm? You've the might to mend the harm that's been done. - What about Jody, Hepzibah? I've got to help her, too. I've got to get her away. - Of course, you do. Of course, you do. Girls! - What is it? - Did you call us? - Yes, come on. - What is it? - Oh, what a surprise, hello, Jane. How are you, dear? It's very nice to see you. - Very nice to see you. - Jane Stuart and I have been talking, haven't we? When I'm gone, when I'm gone, I need to know that you girls are being taken care of. Now, Jane here was thinking about... Well, Jane, speak up, speak up. - I was thinking, well, wondering if you'd ever thought of adopting someone? - We did talk about that. - Yes, we did. A boy! We always said a boy, sister. - You know very well we know nothing about dressing a boy, Justina. It will have to be a girl. - They've been squabbling over this for years. - A little girl of 10 with emerald eyes and dark-- - Blue eyes and fair, curling hair. - I think I know the very girl. Her name's Josephine Turner and you'll love her. (thunder rumbles) - Is she pretty? - We certainly wouldn't want an ugly child. - She has very nice eyes. She's a bit thin, and she's never had any nice clothes, but she'll be very attractive when she grows up. - There wouldn't be any danger of her having, you know, unpleasant insects about her? - Absolutely not! Jody use to live on Blythe Avenue in Toronto. That's a very respectable neighborhood, you know. - And now she lives with Jim the Post at Bright River. - Dear me. - Poor child. - I imagine if there is a problem, I mean, a fine-toothed comb might do the trick. That is, if the child has, you know, unpleasant insects. (thunder rumbles) - No. - I'm afraid not. - You don't want her? - [Violet] She's from away. - It just wouldn't do. But thank you for suggesting it, dear. - Now, that's been taken care of. (lightning cracks) We'll see you first thing in the morning. Now, mind you bring that girl here as soon as ever you can. - [Jane] But-- - You just bring her to us. Now, hurry up before the rain starts, go on. (gently dramatic instrumental music) - Jody? Are you there? You come with me right now, Jody Turner. I've got a place. (Jim grunts) (dramatic instrumental music) - Let's have our tea. I'm not going to wait any longer. - Here, sister. - We'll have our toast and jam. - Where have you been, Jane Stuart? - Miss Violet, Miss Justina, I have a favor to ask you. - Where is she? - Who? - Our little girl. - You promised, Jane Stuart. - Jody? You mean you really do want her? - Why, of course, we do. - What have you done with her? - She brung her here where she belongs. (tender instrumental music) - Dear heart. - Poor soul. - Your power is greater than you know, Jane Stuart. (tender instrumental music) (car rumbles) (birds cry) - Jane? I'm home. - Dad. - Where did you find this? - In Evelyn's room. - [Andrew] In Evelyn's room? Did Aggie let you in? - I know you won't believe me, but I felt like Evelyn led me to it. - [Andrew] Jane, Evelyn's dead. - She wants you to understand what happened. She wants to right the wrong she did to you and Mom. Irene kept it from you all these years. - Do you know what you're saying? - Dad, I think so. - [Andrew] I wanted to protect you from all this. - Wait, Dad. I knew you wouldn't believe me. - I don't wanna believe it. - What really happened to Evelyn? Tell me, please. (tender instrumental music) - I never told your mother this, but I found out from Dr. Arnett that Evelyn was coming by to see Robin when I was away. She kept telling her to leave the island, that she'd never be happy here, and that I was still in love with her. When I found out, I went after Evelyn and told her I never wanted to see her again. She was furiously angry. It was later that night that she lost her way in the blizzard and was killed. The verdict at the inquest was accidental death but that didn't stop people from talking. Your mother took it all very hard because I couldn't talk about it. It was too painful. Somehow, I've always felt guilty about everything that happened, Jane. Your grandmother kept writing, begging Robin to come back to Toronto. One day, she took you with her. Just for a visit, she said, but she never came back. - Why didn't you write? - I did. But Mrs. Kennedy wrote back, telling me that Robin no longer wished to communicate. - I'm sure Mom never got your letter. Grandmother wouldn't have forwarded it. Perhaps it's not too late. - It's been too long. It's over and done with. There's nothing you can do. I'm going to start a new life. It's enough that we found each other. (rolling instrumental music) - [Lillian] Look at this. Andrew! (rolling instrumental music) - Whoa, here you are, Lillian. - [Lillian] Look at those. - And if you need any more, you know where to come. - I'll take two for the ride. Bye, take care. Andrew, I'm sorry about what Irene did. It's a closed book. - I understand. (melancholic instrumental music) - I'd like to buy an apple, please. Thank you. - I can help get Lantern Hill organized again. The sun's come out. You got a ticket? Don't worry, Irene's not coming. Things will settle down now that Jane's leaving. - Morning, Mr. Solt. - Morning, Miss. Jody! Bless my stars! Come into an inheritance, have you? - I buys me own way now. Jane! - Jody! - Jane dear, we're planning on buying a cow. - So she can have a glass of warm milk. - Every night. And we've knitted her two sweaters. - [Violet] Show Jane, dear. - See, I wear two at the same time. That way, there's no hard feelings. - Goodbye, dear, have a happy Christmas. We are so much obliged to you. - You won't forget to write and tell me how Hepzibah's doing, will you? - Oh, she's just tired I expect. Don't you worry so much. I'll keep an eye on her. See you, Jane. - Bye, Jody. - Goodbye, Jane. Your father and I will plant your garden this spring. - You will write to me, Dad, won't you? - I'll write, but I can't promise you'll get my letters. I'll get you back here somehow. Here, a spot of hard cash for you. Have a merry Christmas, Jane. - You can't spare this, Dad. - Now, now, never mind. Editors have been generous with me this fall. Since you've been about, my work has improved tremendously. You write to me as soon as you get home. What have you done with your bag? - I must have left it at the stall. - I'll get it, you hop on the train and find your seat. - Aunt Irene. Lillian said you weren't coming. - Why did you show him the letter? - It wasn't for you to keep. - I'd like it back now, Jane. - No, Aunt Irene. - For the sake of Evelyn's reputation, leave her memory in peace. Haven't you done enough, turning my brother and Lillian against me? They're all the family I have. - What about my family? - Oh. - You made Mom leave Dad. You hid the letter so she'd believe dad still loved Evelyn. - Your mother left him of her own choice. She's quite happy where she is. - Is she? - Jane? Jane? Jane? - There's no point in showing your mother that letter now. You don't want to raise her hopes. She'll only be disappointed, all over again. - What are you talking about? - Don't you realize? You're too late, dear, much too late. You mustn't forget Lillian. - [Conductor] All aboard. (train whistle blares) (exciting instrumental music) - [Andrew] Did she get on? I can't find her. - She must have, oh, look, the train's leaving. - Dad! - Jane! What's wrong? Don't worry, sweetheart, I'll send it in the mail. Chin up, sweetheart, you'll be back soon. - Goodbye, Dad! Goodbye! (sweeping instrumental music) - [Irene Voiceover] There's no point in showing your mother that letter now. It's too late, dear, much too late. (train whistle blares) - [Hepzibah Voicepver] It's him must speak the truth if he's to win her back. (graceful instrumental music) - One way, Bright River. - Better hurry, she going in a minute. - Don't worry, I'll make it. (train whistle blows) (sweeping instrumental music) Operator? - No use, Missy. The line's been down since suppertime, when the storm hit. Oh, she's a real doozy, this one. You better stay here til the worst's over. The phone will be up in an hour. - It's all right, really. I know my way. (plucky instrumental music) Evelyn. (tinkling instrumental music) It's all right, Evelyn. The letter won't make any difference anymore. Dad's got to do the rest on his own. (tinkling instrumental music) Rest now, Evelyn. (sweeping instrumental music) - [Andrew] Jane? My God, how did you get here? - Are you going to marry Lillian Morrow? - Have you gone crazy? Why would I marry Lillian? - Why shouldn't you marry her? - What in heaven's name is going on here? - Tell me why you can't marry Lillian. - She's a good woman and an old friend, but I could never marry her because-- - Because why? - Because I'm still in love with your mother. - Get on the phone and tell her! - I can't just call her up like that. Anyway, the lines are down from the storm. - Maybe the phone at the station is working now. You have to tell her now. We can't waste any more time. - [Andrew] How did you get back here through the blizzard, Jane? (phone rings) - Hello. Hello, who is this? - This is Andrew Stuart, Mrs. Kennedy. I'd like to speak to Robin, my wife. - I'm afraid she's lying down. Where is my granddaughter, Mr. Stuart? - Jane is staying here. She's not coming back. - Andrew, who is this? Is that you, Andrew? When can we expect Jane? - Robin. - What's she saying, Dad? What's she saying? - Robin, it's me, Andrew. - She knows who you are, Dad. Tell her, go on. - Is Jane there? - Yes, she's here, Jane's here. - Tell her! - Tell her what? - Tell her that you love her. She has to come at once, that something important has happened. Tell her to take the next train. - You have to come at once. Something important has happened. - Is Jane hurt? Is she all right? - He's only trying to deceive you. He wants to keep the child. - [Andrew] No, she's all right. - Oh, thank God. - Robin, I love you, I want you to come back. Did you hear me? I love you and want you to come back. (static hisses) - What's that man saying to you? - I said I love you! - What? (static hisses) - She cut me off. (train whistle blares) - You cut us off. - There's no point in any further discussion. A lawyer's what we need now. - How dare you? I was talking to my husband, and you cut me off. - Brandy, Gertrude. - I'll call William straight away and get him to speak to that man's lawyer about a divorce. - Divorce, what are you talking about? - I know now I was wrong, letting things drag on all these years. We have to consider our strategy carefully. There can be no question as to who gets custody. And I-- - Mother, please. This is not some kind of war. - I'm only trying to protect you, my dear. - You've tried for years to make me believe that he didn't love me. I don't hate him, Mother. - How can you speak to me like that? After all I've done for you, all these years. - Oh, Mother, please. You know I didn't mean it like that, but I have to do something. Hello, operator? - [Operator] Operator, may I help you? - Operator, yes, I would like the operator for Prince Edward Island. - [Operator] Through what exchange, please? - [Robin] It's in the town of Bright River. - [Operator] I'm sorry, ma'am, that line has been disconnected. - Are you sure? Will you try again, please? - [Operator] No, ma'am, the line is dead. - Thank you. (melancholic instrumental music) (knocking) - Jody. How did you know I was here? - Hepzibah knew you'd come back. Don't ask me how, but she knew. You gotta come quick, Jane. She's slipping away. - Hurry, Dad, please. Hepzibah has to get well. She has to see Mom when she gets here. - Look, she's not coming, Jane. She hung up the phone on me. She doesn't want anything to do with me. - I don't believe it. She's coming. You'll see when the train gets here. (gentle instrumental music) - The light hurts my eyes, Violet. Oh, there you are. You were right to do what you did. - Mother's coming back, isn't she? - She don't have your strength, child. Spirit's willing. You've always had the power to bring her back. Hold my hand now. Stand fast. Good and strong. - Please, wait, until she gets here. You have to speak to her. What would we do without you? - You don't need me anymore. (gentle instrumental music) - [Jane] Hepzibah. (gentle instrumental music) (train whistle blares) - We've been doing this for three weeks. This is pointless, Jane. I'm going. - Dad, please, wait. You have to be patient. I know she's coming. If not today then maybe tomorrow. - It's foolish, sweetheart, she's not coming. - Mother. (dramatic instrumental music) - You've come back to stay, haven't you? - Yes, Andrew. (graceful instrumental music) (insects chirrup) (bird cries) (brassy instrumental music)
