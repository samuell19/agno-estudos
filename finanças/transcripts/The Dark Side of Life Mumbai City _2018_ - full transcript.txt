Anand, don't irritate me so early in the morning. Petrol, diesel prices going up... value of gold going down... ...whether the 'Lok pal' bill will pass or not... you know everything, right? You speak with lot of confidence. But, when it comes to you... you fail. This is the problem with ordinary people like us. We decode the complicated things easily. But, we are unable to solve our own problems. Yes. Anand, did you pay the broker? Yes, I did. I gave him the cheque. Parul, you know... Since the time we have come here to live in this 'big' society... ...my confidence level has increased. Level? Level. Hello, sir. You were supposed to meet Sameer Khanna this hour. Uh... yes. But sir, his brother died in accident yesterday. Idiot. Don't use such words for the dead. I am telling you. This was your chance. You could have gone there to offer your condolences... ...and you could have told him... that, it could have been him, instead of his brother. Then, what could have happened to his wife and children? But sir, this is... Anand, what if you don't complete your target this month? It will happen. I am going to get a big policy. Worth one Crore. One Crore? Nothing is going to happen in one Crore, Ravi. Verma, I'll be a little late for the office. No. My daughter has come from hostel. Who changed the channel? Oh! Nifty points up. Shall we have breakfast? Yes. Have you brushed your teeth? Yes. Prove. Oh, okay. Fresh. Let's go. 'Little princess is arriving to have her breakfast.' Here. Sir, if you allow, then, can I speak to Mr. Kanojia? I'll talk to Kumar tonight. Hey, hello... What, brother? Can't you understand? What happened? I have told you so many times that, do not park your car inside the society campus. Park it outside. Haven't I? Can't you behave properly? Hello... tell your wife, don't interrupt in the middle. You have to take your car out, right now. Look, how he's talking. I am saying right. I am talking to him. Look... Sharma... The parking slot is anyways vacant. Oh, it's vacant. Do one thing. Bring two trucks loaded with bricks. Why? Seize the place. Construct a bungalow for yourself. That'll we great. Nonsense talking. Since how long you have been here? One month. It means, there is still a period of 10 months pending. You want to live here for the next 10 months or not? You are a tenant, so, your car has to be parked outside. Understood? Car has to go out. Watchman, get his car out. What does he think of himself? We are going through bad times, otherwise, I could have retaliated. Our life has become worse than dogs. Bloody... rascal... Being a chairman, he thinks, he is the landlord. They have no idea. How hard we both are trying to manage the rent. And now, this humiliation. Sexologist. Tracy... What is this? Don't you think... that you need this? You are taunting me... ...because of your needs. If you had understood my needs... ...then, there was no need to taunt. What do you mean? Voren... A person is called a man not only when he is good outside... but on bed too. C'mon, move. Hey, stop. Stop the car. A person is called a man not only when he is good outside, but on bed too. Where are you coming from? Kashmir. Sir, they are from Kashmir. Stop them. Get out from the car. Yes? What did you just say to the girl? Nothing. What are you guys doing? Get out. Why her? Name? Zohra. Search her. Sir, this is a ladies constable's job. What if she is a suicide bomber? Leave her. How can you search her? Take him away. Go back. Please. Pallav, wait. I think, something is wrong. Hey, hero! Are you new here? Yes. It's been two days. 'God, please help me.' 'God...' Hey, you. Stop. Being a man, you cannot search a woman. Will you do it, then? Have you seen yourself? You are not sober. How will you search her? Wait a minute. Excuse me. Hello, hello... excuse me. Please, we need help. Just for a minute... Listen, hello... Let's go. They are making a ruckus. Are you sure? Just leave. Please, listen to me. Let's go. Hello... She is not drunk. What? If you have any doubt on her... she will search her. Not you. Come. Hey, hero! Where do you stay? I haven't found a place to stay yet. So, I am here on road. You look like a decent boy. Then, why didn't you get a place? I found a place in a chawl. But, when they found out that, I am a Hindu, they threw me out. Okay. You write down my number. If you have nowhere to go, then, give me a call. 9908896499 My name is Shabbo. Let's go. I got a message from inspector. Thank you. One coffee with extra sugar. Sugar prices have gone up. Hmm. Can I drop you somewhere? No. Thanks. He is new in Mumbai. He doesn't have a place to stay. I won't rape you. I am a decent girl. Come. By tomorrow morning, I'll get a place to stay. So... Thank you. Till then, I'll show you Mumbai. Come. I am Kavya. Prince. Are you a singer? Yes. Great. So, your first live performance in Mumbai, will be for me, right? Tanya, I'll be down in two minutes. How is Tanya? She is fine. Dady, why don't you marry her? Because... I am scared. That she would come in between us. She should be scared instead. What if I come in between both of you guys. That is not possible. You know why? Because... you always... want me to be happy. And you love me a lot. Doesn't she? Means? She too will cherish your happiness. Maybe. Why are you not confident? Because it is about her feelings. How can I say? How do you know my feelings? Because you are my daughter. But, isn't she your girlfriend? Yes. But there is a difference between a girlfriend and daughter. But, father and boyfriend are same. You are talking same like your mother. This time, you have to introduce me to Tanya. Then, I'll tell you, how much she loves you. But, you opinion can be wrong also. It can't. Because I don't love her. Means? You love her... That's why, you said, maybe. Yes. But, I'll only answer either yes or no. No one can win from you. Right? Now sleep. Did you brush your teeth? Yes. Prove. Fresh. Fresh. Sleep. Come. Sleep. Here. Goodnight. Goodnight. Come. Is this your house? No. This is Montu's house. His family has gone to USA. So, we do group study here. Hi, Montu. Hey, guys. Meet my new friend, Prince. Hi! And listen... Tonight we will listen to a live music. Yey! So, what's new Vicky? Only diamonds. You wait, I am coming. Okay? Vicky, the diamond king. Just a king. You are the diamond, I wish to buy. You mean, compro? I would love to compro. How many of them? Excuse me. Well, how long can you go? Bull shit. Hello. Sumit. C'mon, let's dance. Please, please, please. No. You go. I can't. If you don't want to dance... then, why do you come here? We are talking business. Please, please. Okay. Hey! C'mon, yey! I don't know how to dance. And dancing in front of all, would be like... There is nothing big in it. Have four to five shots of tequila and then, automatically you'll start dancing. On 7th, PPL is going to announce their IPO. This time, I guarantee you that, it's going to get double. Did I ever ask you for any guarantee? Just tell me the amount, I'll send you tomorrow. Thank you. Stop. Stop. Stop. What happened? I want to pee. But, here? I want to do it. You don't have to. Oh! Oh God! Pallav... When are we getting married? Is this a place to talk, Kad? My mom asks me everyday. "Even after getting separated, I still live somewhere inside you." "Even after getting separated, I still live somewhere inside you." "Then, I became so lonely." "That I lost myself." "Then, I became so lonely." "That I lost myself." "I'll cry in your absence for a long time." "I'll just think of you day and night." "I'll cry in your absence for a long time." "I'll just think of you day and night." "Without you." "Life has also." "Become strange." "Blanket of sadness." "Covering it all over, happiness slept." "Now there is only loneliness." "Within me and outside." "There is a an emptiness." "I'll cry in your absence for a long time." "I'll just think of you day and night." "I'll cry in your absence for a long time." "I'll just think of you day and night" You wanted a Russian? No. After interrogating my whole body... ...you missed the encounter. Or else, your bullets got over? No. Just... ...the safety lock got stuck. Can I tell you one thing? Do a check-up of your safety lock. At least find out... ...whether it's stuck or it's not functioning anymore. Hello... who is it? This is Prince. Yes, Prince. Tell me. Shabbo, I have reached near the temple. Okay. Ask someone, where is Girnar society. Okay, Girnar society. Okay. Yes. Excuse me. Yes. Where is Girnar society? Over there. I did a huge mistake... ...by calling you to Mumbai. Why are you blaming yourself? This was my decision. That inspector was behaving like... ...as if we are not from Kashmir... but from Pakistan. Just because we are Muslims. If this was the case... then, that Hindu girl wouldn't have helped us. Forget him. Can forget? I am a psychiatrist. You should have gone to a sexologist. Yes. My wife had sent me there. But... I came to you. It means that, you know you are physically fit. But... there is something... which disturbs... ...your concentration. Hmm. I was in 6th class. My... teacher... caught me smoking. 'Should I inform your grandfather that you smoke?' 'No, sir.' 'You pants are wet. Remove it.' Oh... you have been molested. Hmm. Some sugar. Hmm? Hmm. Baba has helped all these people here by giving them shelter. Even they didn't get home to stay in Mumbai? They had their own houses, but, their children threw them out. Baba... Shabbo. Baba... let him stay with you. Who is he to you? No one. What is his name? Hindu. I mean... my name is Prince. And I... am a Muslim. Zulfikar Hussein. My name is Zulfikar Hussein. Baba... Hmm. Just because he is a Hindu, Muslims are not giving him a place to stay. And Hindu's are not letting him stay because he is a bachelor. No one asks Shabbo about her religion. Am I right, Shabbo? Till the time, you don't get a place, you can stay here. But, yes... ...like a human being. Uhh! But, if you don't like me then, Why are you letting me stay? Dear... We need to put lot of efforts for everyone's happiness. And you are not happy... because I am a Hindu. My happiness lies in... first and foremost, if all the... religious leaders can come together and find the answer to... ...God, as we call it... Whether he is a Hindu or a Muslim. Drink it. This is vegetarian. Brother, make two plates. Why does everyone thinks that... a girl roams with it in her hand. What happened? Same thing. My boss. He only wants one thing. Anand, taking loan is not possible. What happened in your office? Boss gave me the ultimatum. If I don't complete the target this month, then, I don't know, what will happen. Do you remember, Parul? When we came to this city... I thought, I'll own this city. Never came to know, when did the city bought us. I don't know, how and when it will happen? Credit card bill is pending. We haven't yet paid this month's car EMI. And tomorrow or day after tomorrow... We have to pay the rent as well. Look, I'll manage this month's rent. But... we don't pay the car installment... Okay. Everything will be fine. 'Pani Puri'. Don't eat 'Pani Puri' or else your throat will get disturb. How much? 30 rupees. You must thank God. He knows that, we... are not in a position to afford a kid. HE has taken the blame on himself. Everything will be alright. Abdul... Yes. From tomorrow, get only vegetarian food. Why? Have you changed your faith? Okay! So now, do I have to eat non-veg to prove my faith? Why are you eating vegetarian food because of me? Because I don't want to spoil your religion. My religion is not so fragile that, it would get spoil. Is it? But, I have only known this. If it goes down by 100 points... then, buy 4000 more. Right, sir. But... Trust me. Ravi... In share market, always be a... bull. Hmm. As you wish, sir. Okay... How much we have invested till now in PPL? Sir, 25 Crores! And how much is our's and how much is theirs? Sir, our's is 10, and 15 of investors. Fantastic. Yes, mother. I am fine. Yes. I am staying in the same place. Don't worry. Everything is fine. Yes, I am totally fine. Okay. Okay, bye. Who else is there in your family? Me and my mom. And Daddy? When I was just three years old... my daddy... Left us. Oh. Sorry. It's been 30 years now... Dad never said sorry. Then... why are you saying? Why am I saying it? You are right. You have come here... to become a singer, right? No. Actually, mother wants me to become a singer. I just want to make a lot of money quickly. For mom or for Kavya? Actually, there is someone... for whom I need to get medical treatment done. Who? Who is it, Prince? Whom I hate the most. Oh! Interesting. The one you hate the most... you want to cure that person by making a lot of money. Can I ask you the reason, why? Yes, because... mom loves him very much. Oh! Two little birds sitting on a wall. Yeah. So, let's do it tomorrow. Is there a problem? Daddy, catch. Yes, yes. Oh... Sharma, no risk, no gain. Understood? Daddy, catch. He is your son, right? Irfan. Wrong. I'm his... Where is Irfan? United States of America. Doesn't he come to meet you? Even now I remember everything of my father... and my mother. But Irfan... at the age of 20, he forgot everything which his parents had taught him... and left for America. And what about mother? Ameena. Ameena... couldn't wait for Irfan. What's so special in this news? What? What is it, which is making you so angry? My contract is going to over with your company. After that, we will get married. Wasn't this decided before? Did I say anything wrong in the media? If you want to spoil your career... No problem. Nobody can stop you. Why did you say my name? Then whose name I should taken? I'm sleeping with you since seven years. Just shut up. You shut up. What did you think of me? A whore! You never wanted to marry me. You were just using me. You were just using me. My career... My future... Kad. Just leave me, you bastard. What are you doing? Leave me. Listen to me. Just leave me. Listen to me. Listen to me. Please. I love you. If you don't marry, I'll commit suicide. Baby, listen to me. Listen to me. I know it. I am trying to make you understand something else. You are not an ordinary girl. You are a super model. You cannot publicize about your marriage. I'll marry you. I forgot to tell you. Nonu was saying that, we should get marry. Nonu is a kid. What do you want? Even I want to. Whatever you want... you are getting it. After marriage... you won't get something new. Meer, brother. Hello. Hello. How are you Abid? By the grace of God, I'm fine. If there is any problem... Well... That is all okay. I couldn't ask you in front of Zohra. We were told of Delhi. Why suddenly Mumbai? About this... only Hazrat can tell you. But till the time you don't meet him... be alert with the police. He was in the wanted list for a long time. But, how is he here? He was disturbing a lot, hence, I got him here and killed him. Sunny Leone! Nice choice. I came to know that, you can't control yourself on duty. At least have some respect for the uniform. They were from Kashmir. There was no lady constable. So... There are so many member of parliament from Kashmir... Will you search them in the same way? What if the media had come to know about this? So what? They would have suspended me. What else? Only you? Voren... The entire department gets shaky. You have just got married recently... and such is your condition. Tell me one thing. Tracy doesn't let you come close to her, right? Today was a bad day for share market. PPL company's IPO... Yes, my child. How are you daddy? I'm okay. I am a little busy. Daddy, come home early. We'll have dinner together. Yes. I'll try. Okay? Okay. I love you my child. I love you too. The producers have invested 500 Crores. The people who have invested money on this IPO... they are totally shocked and they can see their downfall. Many of them have committed suicide... due to the major downfall in the stock market. Parul. As you know, I want to reduce the staff in the office. But I can save you from laying off. If... If I sleep with you. Ritu. Yes, sir. Keep this money for you. Money? But it's not the month end yet. No actually... I've sold this house. So from tomorrow... ...you... Sir... Give me the address of your new house, I'll come there. You won't be able to come. It's far away. Who are you? I'm Anand, is your sir at home? Yes. Sir. Anand sir has come to meet you. May I? Come in. Yes? Hello, good evening sir, I'm Anand. Come, sit. Hello! Ya! Have we met before? Yes! I called you last week. I'm the insurance agent. Anand Ratna Working, remember? Yes, I'm the one. No, Anand, I think... you got pretty late. No, you called me today. So maybe, I called you too early. In fact... I've purchased some other policy, so... It won't be possible. Oh! I'm sorry. Oh! Okay, thank you! Okay! For how long will you smoke? Should we go inside? We will. Sorry! We will go. Both of us are jobless now. What will we do going home? And we also don't have to wake up early. What is it Zohra? You seem to be worried. I saw a dream at night. Since then I'm worried. What did you see in the dream? It was a strange one. Your father was crying during his funeral. But that funeral was of his young days. The father who cried... was old. A dream is just a dream, Zohra. You shouldn't think about it much. I'm thinking about something else, Mir. What do you mean? I hope you are not doing anything wrong... since you anger for losing your dear ones. Don't you trust me? I do. That is why, I fear it might break someday. The intelligence bureau has warned the Mumbai police... that some terrorists can target some of the crowded... places of the city. The police force has increased the security due to Diwali celebrations. Religious places, airports, railway stations, malls and cinema halls... Yes? Tell me. What's it? Haven't you not given the brokerage to that broker? We gave him the cheque. Did you? Really? The cheque has bounced. He comes in the society thrice but still he... doesn't get to meet you. What is going on? Actually, we... We... What? I learned today that a... lot of people visit you. They ask in the society about your office address. What is going on? We don't know who... Are you guys under debts and when people come over... to ask for money, you don't open the door in-spite of being home. It's nothing like that. This is our personal matter. Wait a minute. Oh, I see... its your personal matter. Who are you? Sorry! You are the tenants. So this is not your but our personal matter. Understood? What will you understand, you tenants? You might someday shift from here, but I'll... ...be answerable to the society. One minute. You please come inside... Why should I come inside? Look, please, I'll... ...pay his money next week. You will have to. You will have to pay. And listen to me for once. I'm making very clear. No creditor should visit here. You please come in... Why should I? I'll give you the notice to vacate the flat in just one day. You bloody tenants! Personal matter, my foot! Prince. Any progress? Kavya has given me a chance to sing a tough track. But... the ones who can give me work... doesn't let me in. Even a stone doesn't take a shape of the God without a hammer. You think you will achieve everything without facing troubles? Go on. Anand... is this what... we dreamt about our life? Then why are we alive? Dad... I gave money to Sumit, not to the stock market. Dad, I want to share something with you. I'll talk to you later. You never have time for me. Hey listen... you don't behave like your stupid mother. Sir, I didn't inform you first but... Mr. Khanna is calling me again and again. He is abusing me. When one goes through bad times... people tend to behave like this. These are office papers. Give it to Mr. Khanna. Mr. Kumar. Can I call... you in 5 minutes? Thanks! "Madness." "Waywardness." "Madness." "Waywardness." "Madness is with me." New face of Caza. "Shadows." "Isolation." Bloody, Pallav. How can you do this? My story is... not different than Abid. I was very young... when the mentor while leaving the mosque... was attacked by the soldiers. My younger brother grew up... to be a wise and talented boy. The police killed him... calling him terrorist in a fake encounter. My mother was so traumatized seeing the dead body of her young son... that she died in front of me. "There's no use..." of living". "There are roads but no destination." "There's no use..." of living". "There are roads but no destination." "I'm finding you everywhere." "Why are you oblivious to me. Loneliness." "Sadness." "Alienation." "It is with me." "Madness." "Waywardness." "Madness is with me." You gave the office to Mr. Khanna. Now what will you give to Mr. Kumar? House. "Those fading..." "...pictures." Then where will you stay? "The bad luck..." You... are over. "Those fading pictures." Now I'm completely over. "The bad luck..." Just now. "Why was I punished for this?" I'll leave. I have to take mom out. Excuse me. Tanya. Yes. Say bye to mom on my behalf. Bye? "Madness." "Waywardness." "Madness is with me." "Shadows, Isolation." "Helplessness is with me" What is this? Are you playing with it? Play it after putting on the safety lock. If the bullet would have hit you wrongly... people would have thought that a policeman committed suicide. I don't understand what... kind of phone is this. I don't get any calls. Show it to me. Hey, there it rings. Hello! Hello! Hello! Hello! Hello! Hello, Irfan! Hello... I'm not Irfan, I'm Anand. I'm so sorry sir. I'm the insurance agent. Listen Mr. Zulfikar. I'm suggesting you this policy being an older brother. Hello! Oh no! Oh, sorry! What happened? The lace is stuck inside. It's not stuck inside. Even Irfan... couldn't tie the lace... of his pajamas properly. He used to be the same... while tying the lace. You miss Irfan too much, isn't it? No! Did he shift to the US... because he was upset with you? Irfan did quite a lot of things in the last 20 years... which made me upset. But I didn't leave him. Parents do not leave their kids for... the mistakes they commit. Maybe... because of the generation gap. You failed to understand him. Generation gap? Son, there was a still a generation gap when I was... 35-years-old and he was 10-years-old. Maybe, he settled in the US... for having a good future. But Irfan was only my future. Maybe. I was wrong. Okay then, see you tomorrow. Thank you! Thank you so much. Thank you! I've a recording on 15th. You will have to come along. Why? Because... I've no one else apart from you. Really? Listen, young man... your work has started. I want you to make arrangement for your living somewhere else. Do you really want me to go? Yes! Because I don't want to get attached to you. And I don't want this relation... to become just like Irfan and I share. Zohra, I'm helpless. Or else, I wouldn't had send you home alone. Hey, stop the taxi. Hello! Yes? Hold one. Wait! Zohra I'll just come. Hello, yes? Hold on for a minute. It was an important call Zohra and I have been asked to come immediately. Don't wait for me Zohra. Okay. Goodbye. Goodbye. "The heart is beating and I'm teary-eyed." "Tells me day and night." "There is a vacuum inside my heart all the time." "With my tears like an omen." "I remain immersed within myself." "This is my only madness." You haven't slept yet? I'm not feeling sleepy. Are you waiting for brother Irfan's call? I apologize for reading your diary. Happy Birthday father. "I am wandering alone, along with my heart." "I am wandering alone, along with my heart." "I am wandering alone, along with my heart." "I am wandering alone, along with my heart." "Wandering." "Wandering." "Take a decision to live inside me." "By God, I am yours and you are mine." "You are my teacher and guardian." "You are equivalent to all." "This is my only madness." "I am wandering alone, along with my heart." "I am wandering alone, along with my heart." "I am wandering alone, along with my heart." "Wandering." "Wandering." Sir? Yes? It's my last day in office in Ravi. I will stay for some more time... You may leave. Okay sir. Ravi? Sir? Thank you. Aren't you happy? 'Keep looking with care at your shadow during your journey, ' 'By doing so, you may not have' 'the feeling of being alone.' I've always celebrated Irfan's birthday lavishly. But I don't think that he'll even perform my last rites properly. Why is it that the parents are ready to sacrifice everything for their children's happiness. But those very kids, when they grow up, are not willing to do anything for their parents' happiness. Kavya? Kavya. You'll not agree. A 'kick' is required in life. Your 'kick' is a really bad one. Is your family aware of it? Everyone else knows other than family. Anyways, what family do I have? I just have a father. Just for telling people. Your father has come back? And your... boyfriend? I mean is he aware of it? His alcoholism... by trying to make him get out his alcoholic ways, I've become an alcoholic and I continue to be one. But in the process I've lost him. And now I'm single. Will you be my boyfriend? "Madness." "Madness" Did you bring? Yes. You didn't have any problems right? No. Things which are illegal to sell are easily available. Don't you think Parul, that after taking the decision, we are feeling relaxed? Yes. There was a feeling of suffocation. It seems like that's over now. And as it is, there's no guarantee of lives of commoners like us. Sooner or later we would have died. We could even get killed in a bomb blast tomorrow, who knows. Or maybe some life threatening disease can take our lives away. Even if we escape that somehow, we'll surely die starving. That's why it's better to die as per our wish. Is there any money left? Yes. After paying up some small bills, and keeping some amount aside for cremation, around 2000 rupees was left. I've taken that out. Why? Let's eat some good food. I'm ordering Chinese then. Chinese. It's the last day of our lives. Isn't it? "There is nothing left to achieve in life." "There are ways but no destination." "To find you, I wander from one place to another." "Why are you ignorant of me. Loneliness." "Dishonor." "Strangeness, is in me" "Madness, Wandering." "There is a fog like feeling which exists within me." Other than you there are other associates of mine who are at it. All the bombs should blast at the same time. 435 rupees. Give some change madam, how do I get change for 2000 rupees. Keep it. But madam... Yes keep it and keep this as well. It works. This can't be possible. Monu is related to you. No. She is the daughter of the dancer from the 'Beer Bar'. When I had refused to let her into my house then there's no way my decision will be otherwise for her daughter also. Someone who isn't alive anymore... If the truth is unbearable for you then why have you come to me? It's about the life of Nonu dad. You go and drop her in some orphanage. I doubt whether you are her father also. What is the guarantee that you are my father? Leave it son. There's no use. Wherever you are going, take Nonu along with you. Sir Singer Prince has come. Ask him to sit. All of this was possible because of Kavya. I will tell her today that how much I love her. Okay bye now. How are you dear? Sorry sir I was late. Not 'was'. You rather came early. It's just that you left your fate behind. Means? The song that you were supposed to sing, is now being sung by the hero himself. I guess I'm unlucky. It's not that. I'm the one who is unlucky. For not being able to work with a good singer like you. Take care. Hello Kavya? Kavya is in the ICU. She's in a serious state. What? What happened to her? She's had an overdose of drugs. She's very serious. What? You come to Lilavati Hospital as quickly as you can. Yes I'm coming right away. "The heart is beating and I'm teary-eyed." "Tells me day and night." "There is a vacuum all the time." "Inside my heart." Prince. Allah! "With my tears like an omen." "I remain immersed within myself." "This is my only madness." "I am wandering alone, along with my heart." "I am wandering alone, along with my heart." "I am wandering alone, along with my heart." "I am wandering alone, along with my heart." "Madness." "Madness" I Kadambari Chauhan, Thanks for your love guys. I love you too. But you know what? I am scared of falling down. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm going to commit suicide. I'll just be back. Belated Happy Birthday dear. Th.. Thank you mom. Did you get your birthday gift? Yes mom. Did you like it? It's so beautiful like you. Okay listen. Today is a very important day in your life. Enjoy it to the fullest. Okay? Bye dear. Yes mom. Love you. Bye. "Like a fading photograph." "Destiny filled with sadness." "Like a fading photograph." "Destiny filled with sadness." "Why did I get this punishment." "God, what was my mistake." "Impatience, Helplessness." "Attachments of heart are with me." "Madness, Wandering." "There is a fog like feeling which exists within me." "Shadows, Isolation." Kavya? Kavya... "Helplessness within me." Kavya. "Madness, Wandering." "There is a fog like feeling which exists within me." "Shadows, Isolation." "There is helplessness within me." "Madness, Wandering." "There is a fog like feeling which exists within me" I have never hidden anything from you in my entire life. Never! You... If... If you have any desire in your heart then tell me. Desire? In office, girls often drank in parties. I have never done. I had thought that if I get a good opportunity in life, I'll drink with you. But... Parul? Take. Your last drink. What better opportunity will you get? Cheers! Now we'll meet in heaven. In heaven? I don't know if Allah will give me a place in hell or not. What about Hajrat? By listening to any stranger, you want to commit suicide and then call it 'Jihad'. Will it indeed be Jihad? But brother you too have come here when you were summoned by him. He is foolish. He is of the opinion that he is using me. But in reality, I'm the one using him. I didn't exactly get you. It's not Jihad Hamid. It's revenge. Revenge. Even you are doing that. Just that you feel that you are doing it in the name of Jihad. If you've come this far thinking that by doing this you'll reach heaven, then better you back off now. I know how to diffuse a bomb. Open your button. What will you do now brother? I know that I'm going to commit suicide. Suicide. Why have you called us sir. What's the matter? Sorry to call you so late in the night. The delivery boy who ran away with your cellphone? You guys must have lost hope. But I have caught him. Robbery? No. We had only given this mobile to him. What about 1565 rupees? He didn't have change so I asked him to keep it. So much of tipping? Is it a crime to tip someone? Wait. What work do you do? You are the same person who that night with the Kashmiri girl... Let me do the talking please. But why are you asking me. Ask him. So I am talking to him. I am talking to him. You may leave now. Let's go. One minute... You wait for me I'm coming. Okay. Inspector sir. Take this and go. No, no. I had some work with you. Yes tell me. Look, don't take it otherwise, can you lend me 100 rupees? It's that... Do I look stupid to you? Nothing of that sort. Why are you feeling that way? Me and my wife were sitting in the house idly, so... your constable came and picked us up and brought us here. I don't have a wallet and my wife doesn't have any money in her purse. The petrol in my car has also got over. Either give me some money or drop us back home. Thank you. Inspector sir I won't be able to return you this money. I don't need. Thank you. Okay. Do you want to have an ice cream? Ice cream? What happened? You go in. I'm coming. Who has come so late in the night? I'm coming. C'mon, come out. Hey! C'mon now, come, come. Hey! Please leave me. My vest will tear. Your vest will tear? I will take off your sarong and make you parade naked in the society.. Hey! Please leave me. My vest will tear. You are the secretary of the society right? Park your car first. Come rascal. Yes that I'll do at your place. The Watchman is seeing us. Not good. You consider yourself a king. The Watchman is seeing? Considering yourself a king, come! Come, come, come! C'mon move your car now. You parked your car at the place you wished. But remember that today onwards you won't get any food to eat. Yes you are right. Hello? Parul. Sorry... sorry to disturb you sir. I actually wanted to ask you something. So late in the night? It's that I won't be able to ask you tomorrow. Okay tell me. Sir... You... Yes. In order to reach this post. Tell me. How many men have you made your wife sleep with? In your language if I have to say then with how many have you had a relation of 'give and take'? What? How dare you?? How dare you say such a thing? Stay in your limits. You... You are fired? Fire? Who are you to fire me? I'll fire you now. Means? See what I do tomorrow. Parul, Parul please listen to me. You got scared right? Just keep quiet. What happened? What happened? Why did you stop speaking? You got scared? Parul? You are good at abusing. He won't be able to sleep the entire night now. Is there coffee in the house? Yes. Are we going to jump from here daddy? Yes dear. I hope you aren't feeling scared to do so. I am feeling scared actually. But I know as soon as we jump from here, you will become a Superman and save me. So we are going to write a suicide note right? You... spoil my tea set. Sorry. 'As soon as we jump from here, you will become a Superman and save me'. 'You will become a Superman and save me'. Yes? Sister, this is Sumit Balsaria. Can I drop Noor to hostel right now? Yes sir? Actually I had to go somewhere and I was taking her along with me but... I changed my plan. We don't allow to come so late in the night Mr. Balsaria. You could come early morning. Oh, okay. So I'll drop her tomorrow morning. Okay. Thank you. I'm ready. Then why are wasting time in cleaning? That's because a lot of people are going to come tomorrow. What will they think about the way we lived. Daddy? Yes dear. I don't want to go to the hostel daddy. You have to go to the hostel dear. I'm leaving tomorrow. I'll be gone for quite a few days. Only on one condition. What? You would have to call me up every morning. There's no phone there dear. But I can't live without you daddy. You have to learn to live without me dear. I am... going far away. Let's go to sleep now. Have you brushed your teeth? Yes. Fresh... The taxi which is overturned behind me, In there there's a lady, who is stuck still. Policemen are trying to evacuate the area as the bomb can blast anytime. Sorry ma'am. Your membership has been cancelled. Do you know who I am? Do you know who I am? You can't stop me! I need to go in! Pallav. I said let me go in. Sir, please try and explain madam. What... Me... I have to go in. It's okay. She is with me. Okay sir. Fine. The bomb squad is yet to reach the spot. But a brave police inspector of the Mumbai Police has reached the taxi in order to save the lady. Jesus! Kadambari Chauhan. Of course... Sumit Balsaria. Dance? Sir doesn't dance. Kumar sir is yet to come right? I don't have any news about him. Give it to him when he comes. Okay. Give me 4 tequila shots. Yes sir. Good that mother died before. What if she was alive today? She would have been saddened by our decision. If your family gets to know about this they'll say that I'm the one responsible. I don't exist for dad right from the beginning. And what he always felt will turn into reality today. "Life." "Life." "Life." Life". "Life." "At least by mistake." "Meet me some day." "What's the use of these desires, which doesn't even let you breathe" I'm sorry mother. I'm very sorry. "What's the use of these desires, which doesn't even let you breathe." "Desire to live." "Efforts for death." "Efforts for death." "Oh life, Oh life." "Oh life, Oh life." "At least by mistake." "Meet us some day." "At least by mistake, meet us some day." "Whatever little you gave us." "You took it all away within a second." "What did you do." "You betrayal, your business." "Oh life, Oh life." "Oh life, Oh life." "At least by mistake, '." "Meet us some day." "At least by mistake, meet us some day" Jesus. Tracy! We didn't die. But it was not a coincidence. It was a lesson for us. The way we spent that night without any fear, we could have spent the rest of our lives that way as well. If we started living for ourselves instead of others. 'As per the reports from Mumbai, a girl named Zohra was traveling in the taxi. She came to Mumbai from Kashmir few days back. Inspector Voren did save Zohra. But he himself got martyred in this incident. Hello, hello, hello madam? Trusting a stranger so much in no time... that you have brought me to your house? After many years of trust, I believed someone as my own. He too was a stranger. Why did you save me. I should be the one asking that why did you do such a foolish act after all. There wasn't a reason to live. Is it? I read the reason in your suicide note. If I thought like you, then when I failed in the 10th standard, I should have committed suicide then only. But I didn't commit suicide because I passed when I was in the 9th standard. The one I loved, loved someone else. But I didn't commit suicide because my father and mother loved me very very much. Amina came into my life. She loved me immensely. I wanted a girl, but we had a boy instead. Doctors had told me that. Amina couldn't conceive a second child. Then also I didn't commit suicide. I'd thought that when Irfan gets married, I'll give a lot of love to his wife just like I'd give to my daughter. Irfan too left. But, then too I didn't commit suicide. That's because I had Amina with me. Then Amina also left me. Then also I didn't commit suicide. I'd thought maybe someday Irfan will come back. There are some dreams son which may never get fulfilled dear. But in order to live it's very important to have some misconceptions. A model's career is short-lived Sumit. This would have happened sooner or later. But unfortunately, the person I wanted to spend the rest of my life with, cheated me. Kadambari, for such a person who probably was never yours? Isn't it stupid to give life for such a person? You are also doing something stupid. Your depts won't be cleared automatically if you give up your life. Maybe by staying alive you could clear them up. You have a reason to live also. Your daughter. Where's the patient? He is in the bathroom. Hello.- Hello Prince? Your father's health has really deteriorated. We are taking him to the hospital. You send the money quickly. You... SMS me the account number, I will send the money today itself. Who are you? I... I'm Prince's friend. Listen... please give my regards to his mother. Whose mother? Prince's mother. He didn't tell you? It's been 10 years since his mother's death. What?- Yes. Nonu, guess who is it? Tania. Oh my God, Kadambari Chauhan? Why did you lie to me? What? That her name is Tania? What's happening? He was saying that your name is Tania. Oh God! I love you dad. I love you too baby. But she loves you a lot. The bell rang... just a minute. Kumar sir you? Hello Sumit. Where's Nonu? She is inside. And what's all this? What sir? I've heard that you've given your office to Khanna and you'd left these property papers for me? Why? I can't understand what has happened to you. Could you explain it to me Sumit? I hope you aren't planning something like suicide. Nothing can happen by just planning sir. What is destined to happen will happen. Look Sumit. Such a big decision people usually doesn't take by thinking about others. They take in their own interest. And remember one thing. Business isn't always about profits. Sometimes one has to incur losses too. I'm saying from personal experience. Your papers. Experience saves one from taking wrong decisions sir. But one gathers experience... by taking wrong decisions. I know but what I'm telling you, you should try and understand that too. Thank you sir. Okay I'm leaving now. "What is this life all about". Sometimes it snatches away everything in one stroke that was given in abundance. And sometimes it gives back whatever that was snatched away. But to understand such dynamics, it's very important to be alive. Nonu? Yes mother. Zulfiqar uncle is absolutely fine. Yes absolutely fine. You don't worry. Everything's fine. Your mother is indeed very lucky. You've kept her alive even after her death. But there are some unfortunate parents, whose children have made them non existent even when they are alive. Father! Just... waiting for the death certificate to come. "At least by mistake." "Meet us one day." "I'm leaving this city and going back to my village." "I don't think I can ever muster the courage to tell Zohra that." "I had planted the bomb in the taxi that she was sitting in." "I was the killer of inspector Warren that saved her." The want of revenge had turned me into a monster. "Oh Almighty, please pardon me..." "I don't deserve forgiveness," "but if possible, Almighty" forgive me for killing an innocent person". You forget everything. Irfan had lost his teddy once in his childhood. He had cried a lot that day. Amina and I, had tried a lot to find that teddy but we couldn't. God forbid, if something happened to this teddy of mine, I wouldn't have been able to take this pain. Sorry father. Remember one thing son. Lose in life but never lose hope in life. Because in order to change defeat into a win, it's very important to stay alive in life. "When you are not there." "I wander from one place to another." "Shattered." "When there is no thought." "Of yours." "That moment feels like a crime." "The water in my eyes." "You are written on them." "You were there in my heart, but." "I saw you in my eyes." "Never drops through the eyelids." "You never go from within." "You never go from within." "You never go from within." "You never go from within." "You never go from within." "I was under an impression that." "It was just a phase which is gone." "A phase which is gone." "But what is this thing inside me." "You remained inside me like a fragrance." "The emptiness in me." "Erase it some day." "You lit me up and forgot." "Come and blow it off some day." "I keep on burning but never melt down." "You never go from within." "You never go from within." "You never go from within." "You never go from within." "You never go from within." Thank you father. "Without you, this wouldn't have been possible". This song, "I would like to dedicate this song to my father". My dear... to Kavya my true love. Unfortunately. Kavya and my mother is not in this world anymore but. 'I hope they are happier there. "Let me walk a few steps as per my wish." "I've followed your calling always, dear life".
