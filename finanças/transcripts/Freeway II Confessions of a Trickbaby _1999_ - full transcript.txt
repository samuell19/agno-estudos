(MultiCom Jingle) (upbeat hip hop music) - Crystal Van Meter, your life represents a juvenile justice system gone so awry. What a tragedy. Yet to continue allowing you to traffic in drugs, to rob and beat foolish men on the pretext of having a good time, that would only serve to compound that tragedy. Now in view of this eating disorder, I'm directing the Youth Authority to place you into a medical facility where you'll get some help. Then, on your 19th birthday, you'll be turned over to the Department of Corrections to serve a term of no less than 25 years Frontera Institute for Women. (gavel bangs) - What kind of bullshit? Well, this ain't over, not by a long shot. We gonna reverse this bitch. Then I'm gonna get you off, baby. My word is bomb. Be strong. (upbeat mariachi music) - [Crystal] Don't push me, fucker! - You just get sentenced? She's got a sentence, I can tell. What you got? - I really don't wanna talk, all right? - I just got life. - All right. Gotta something to smile about. - Crystal, says here you're bulimic. When'd you eat last? Well, we don't tolerate eating disorders here, miss. You're gonna have some supper. And someone's gonna sit down, make sure you eat every bite. Let's go. (heaving) - Hey, did you really get fed through a tube? - [Crystal] I really don't wanna talk now. - Want me to eat your pussy? - No. Go to sleep. - My name's Cyclona. - Go to sleep, Cyclona. - Hey. - [Crystal] What? - What's your name? - My real name's Crystal. Most people call me White Girl. - I like Crystal, but White Girl's more you. (moans) I love you. I love you. I love you, Sporty Spice. (moaning) I love you, Sporty Spice. Oh yeah. - Look, if you don't cut that out, I'm gonna bust your goddamn head! (Cyclona speaking in foreign language) Aw, man. (Cyclona speaking in foreign language) (Cyclona chuckling) - Shh. - Hey. Hey you. Wanna tell me how you get life? - Yeah, but if you laugh, you're gonna have a real bad night. (ethereal synthesizer music) - It's not the sorta thing a person laughs at. - I got up this morning, right, and I heard this voice. And so I'm looking to see where it's coming from. It told me so much shit. (chuckling) - So who'd you kill? - I'm not telling. - Oh, man. 25 years of this. - [Cyclona] Hey White Girl. - Huh? - You want a back rub? (Cyclona whimpering) - [Guard] What's her story? - You're asking me, goddammit? - I had my period, okay? So don't have a fucking cow! (upbeat rock music) (chuckling) - Crystal. Just in time for lunch. You know the drill. - What the hell is it? - It's turkey, Blanca. Now eat. You too, Mousy, come on. Stop playing with your food. I want those plates clean when I get back. (loud heaving) - You keep on with that shit and you're just gonna end up dead. What, you think they're gonna let you off for humanitarian reasons? - [White Girl] They ain't letting me out. I know that. - So, who do you do it for? - I'd tell you, but then I'd have to kill you. - Y'all barfed again? You know, maybe you won't have to barf so much if you got yourself a little-- (toilet flushes) - Yeah, mine's as big as a bucket. - It's too bad we're stuck in this place. I know this woman who'd straighten your shit out so fast. - Like I need my shit straightened out. - She's this nun named Sister Gomez. You oughta go to chapel with me next weekend. We could pray for her to intercede for you. - You want me to pray to Sister Gomez? - Sister Gomez's goodness could reach you even to this place. - You girls have all been warned about purging. It's clear you didn't take the warning seriously. Now you're gonna see worst there is indeed. (upbeat rock music) - [White Girl] What is it? - Oh, a little Prolixin, a little cortisone. It's gonna suppress your gag reflex. Pretty creative, don't you think? - So we can't make ourselves throw up. - You're aren't gonna feel very good tonight, Crystal, none of you girls are. If this is what it takes, guess it's what we're gonna have to do. (hawks loudly) Charming. Come on. You need some rest. - Hey White Girl. Hey White Girl, you awake? - You know, Cyclona, (chuckles) if this is a booty call, you're wasting your time. - This ain't no booty call. - I gotta get some sleep. Why don't you get the fuck outta here. Go play with yourself or something. - You'll be going to state prison soon, huh? - [White Girl] Yeah, so what? - So you're gonna be all old when you get out, huh? - You'll be in a fucking coffin, so there. - Frontera's maximum security, okay? Once we get to Frontera, that's it, man, we're fucked. Check it out, the clinic is over by this fence. I got some shit buried there that we could use to get through it. - Even if we got through the fence, we'd still need a place to go afterward. - I know this place. It's so fucking rad. (chuckles) - I don't know. I'm awful fucking recognizable these days. - What, 'cause you've been on TV? I've been on America's Most Wanted three times. The place I'm talking about, that don't mean shit. Fuck. Think about it, okay? - Take some orange juice, Crystal. Eat your breakfast burrito. - I hate those fucking things. - Eat your breakfast burrito, Crystal. Won't do you any good to look at it. (suspenseful synthesizer music) I need some assistance here! - Come on, Crystal, you're just making it harder on yourself. - Sit down, Crystal! Eat your food! You want it through a tube again?! It's your choice! (loud splashing) (screams) - Now take her down, White Girl! Go, girl, go! (laughing) - Get her outta here! (loud thud) (groans) - [Cyclona] Get off me! Get off me! (girls cheering) Get off me! Fucking let me go! - Everyone down to number seven! I can't believe this! One month in isolation, Crystal! And another charge! I hope it's worth it. - Yeah, it was, fucking vomit head! (loud thud) (upbeat hip hop music) Fuck you! (moaning) (loud clacks) - Ready to be a good girl now, Crystal? (upbeat rock music) - Yo, yo, man, I heard she got caught molesting that fucked up girl in the wheelchair. And all they managed to do is go to those stupid sexaholics classes they got on Wednesdays. - [Blonde Woman] You mean that bitch who got her spine shot up by the cops? - No, that spazzy cholo with the coppertone hair and that brain disease, so she can't talk or move or nothing, but she thinks just fine. - That bitch is a total perv. She better keep her ass away from me. - You know, I don't get why that coppertone bitch is even here. I mean, she can't talk, she can't move, nothing. And what are they even fucking with us for? I mean, we're all going to the pen for the rest of our lives anyway. - It's all a bunch of fucking perverts. Why else do you think someone would work in a prison? - You know that's true. - This prison isn't that bad. - Oh! - Yeah! (heaving) (chattering) - Keep going. - Oh yeah, oh yeah! - You go, girl. Get on with your bad self. - Yeah, oh yeah! - Come on, get it out. (heaving) - [Crystal] Give me that fucking bucket. - Come on. (coughing) - Bring her out! - [Crystal] Hurry up, I'm getting an urge to purge. - Keep going, girl! - Oh! (heaving) (women cheering) (whimpering) - I gotta get outta here, White Girl. I can't take it no more. - Cyclona, you're here for murder. - It was a mistake, okay?! Fuck! If I don't get outta here, I'm gonna kill myself. - Will you give them that satisfaction? - Hey, I'm only 19, okay? If I kill myself, those fuckers will lose their jobs so fast, they won't know what hit them. - Oh, you think they'd cry over you? - Fuck! - What about this hideout you've been talking about? - It's in Baja. - Mexico? That's just great. - Hey, we make it to Mexico, we're home free. - What, you know people who'd help us? - Yeah, that nun I told you about, Sister Gomez. - She's a nun. Fuckin' A. She's not gonna help us. - Yeah, she will! Do you know what she used to call me when I was little? Her little movie star. - Yeah, and now you're an all grownup convicted killer. You think she's just gonna greet you with open arms? - Sister Gomez's arms are always open, and there's room for both of us. - They can't keep me in this shithole, sticking me with their needles, running tubes down my throat. Problem is, you don't always have a real good grip on reality, and for this to work, everything you say has gotta be real. - Hey, I can be straight. I mean, all I gotta do is take my Stelazine and my Thorazine and my Haldol-- - Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, you gotta take that shit everyday. Otherwise, you can forget about even riding with me. - Yeah, but my mouth gets all dry and I can't turn my neck and-- - Do you know what you are? Just way too outta control. - Hey, I gotta whole bunch. I was saving them to kill myself. (clattering) - [Nurse] Hey, you know you're not supposed to be here! (phone ringing) - Crystal? How you doing, baby? You felling all right, pumpkin? - What are you crazy? I'm totally fucked here. - I went before the State Board of Appeals yesterday, and Judge Calton's had some concerns of a very technical nature, made me feel quite optimistic. You know what me and you are gonna do? If everything starts going our way, we gonna do some ecstasy, then I'm gonna freak your ass hard. You down for that, baby? - Hey, that's great, Mr. Butz, but I can't get by on just wishes. You get what I'm telling you? - Wait, what's up, Crystal? What you trying to say? - Look, I gotta go now. You have a real nice day now, Mr. Butz. - Wait, wait, Crystal! Damn! (upbeat hip hop music) (grunting) - Let me at that fucking thing! (grunting) (loud rip) (groans) Ah, fuck! - Take a seat, Junior, before everything gets cold. - Oh, I can't, Grandma. I got a date with Patty tonight. - Not in my car, you don't, Mr. DUI. - And not looking like that, I hope. - Ah, don't worry. She likes the Dodge anyway. Besides, I think I'm gonna have the fuel line fixed before dark. - [White Girl] This fucking thing gonna kill me? - I don't know, but it sure is gonna sting 'cause of all the bug shit and piss. (White Girl groans) Hey, now I can tell everyone I got to see your ass. It's a nice tight, little ass too. Maybe I oughta suck out the poison like they do on TV. - Yeah, you just try. Well, if this thing gets much worse, you might have to go it alone. - Yeah? What would you do? - I don't know. Kill myself, probably. - I can do that. - Do what? - Kill you. - Got any friends we could call? - Whole world hates my guts. - Oh. What about family? My family's all in jail. - My family's all dead. - Well, I'm sorry to hear that, Cyclona. - Why don't you wait here, and I'll come back as soon as I can work it. - [Radio Host] White people unite. The traders, resplincers, and the New World Order threw us into dissent in the behest of-- (loud thuds) (groans) The satanic Jews to destroy the white race. - [Man] I see here that you and Vanessa were arrested together twice. - We needed money, thought it'd be all grownup turning tricks on Warren Avenue. Was only gonna jack them off is all. - [Man] Did you ever see Vanessa-- (ominous synthesizer music) - Don't move, don't you fucking move, puto cracker. I swear I'll drink your fucking blood. Are we alone? Don't lie to me, grandpa! - My wife is upstairs. - Get up slow, real slow. - The hell, Cyclona? I've been freezing out here. - [Cyclona] I'm here, aren't I? Check it out! - [White Girl] This will work. - That house has got everything, White Girl. Come on, I wanna show you so bad. - What about a gun, did you find a gun? - No, but there's chicken, and all this doctor shit, and there's probably something there for that thing on your leg. And there's this old-fashioned vibrator, the kind you plug in the wall. - Oh, man. Where you think they went, leaving this TV on? - Who gives a shit, as long as they ain't here. - Just don't want the three fucking bears blow in while I'm going through all their shit, all right? You check upstairs already? - Of course I did, I mean, what do you think, I'm stupid or what? - Hey, this shit's for infected cows. - You want me to shoot you up? Just pull them panties down for Cyclona and I'll stick you real good. - Would you stop hitting on me all the time? No, I'm serious. Every chance you get, you starting with all that fucking dyke shit. "You want me to eat you out?" "You want a fucking back rub?" "Oh, you got such a nice ass." "You look just like Sporty Spice when you bend over." Swear to fucking God, you're worse than a goddamn-- - I said I was sorry, okay? Why you wanna make me feel like a dog? - [White Girl] Shoot myself up just fine. - I like shooting up girls. It makes me hot. - Fucking big ass cow needle. It's gonna be a moment to remember. Ow! Shit. Ow! - Man, oh, man. These people really like to eat. I am stuffed like a motherfucking pig, White Girl, I swear to God. - You know, we've only just begun. - Yeah, well, you go, girl. You just do your thing, okay? I'm gonna go upstairs, take a shower, give myself a little makeover. Anyone comes, you know what to do, don't you? Hey! You do know what you do, don't you? - I know what to do better than you do. - [Cyclona] Just wanted to be sure. - Now why don't you go upstairs and talk to your bunkies or whatever it is you do, all right? I don't want to fucking see your face right now. - Fine.

Hey Cyclona! Where's my little spick? Cyclona? (buzzing) (breathing loudly) What you doing here, Cyclona? (ominous synthesizer music) - Why are you so far away? I cannot see you all the way over there. - Could've tied them up, Cyclona. Holy shit, we could've put them in the basement or something. - He tried to rape me, okay? You don't know nothing! (screams) - What's up with you fucking yourself with a goddamn vibrator? Answer me, goddammit! - Don't be hitting me! You're not my fucking mother! - [White Girl] Okay, listen, you and me are splitting up. - Wait, you're leaving me? No. - Just shut the fuck up and listen, okay? I'm talking to you like an adult. Only thing I want is to find some place quiet and blend in. All you wanna do is raise hell. - Look, I know you're all smart 'cause you always have your shit altogether, but I can't do that, okay? I know it, but I'm willing to learn. - Cyclona, you just killed two senior citizens. Where's your fucking heart? (loud slap) Where's your fucking brain? You stopped taking your medicine, haven't you? - Yeah, 'cause it makes me feel totally fucked! Look, I'm so sorry that I'm not all super happy and together like you, you fucking barbie ass punk! - Yeah, maybe you're too much of a bitch to try. - Yeah, maybe you don't got fucking voices chasing you around, telling you shit, like, "You're just a dirty slut!" And how you got cancer in your heart and in your bones! It feels really okay to be all alone! I'm gonna blow it, and they're gonna catch me and put me in one of their cages forever. - You're a goddamn serial killer. - I don't need to be getting called names right now, White Girl. Right now, I'm really shaky. - You belong in a fucking cage. - Look, please, I won't do it again! I promise I won't! - To even think about you and me being together, you'd have to do what I say and when I say it. - Don't be running no power trip stuff here right now, okay? - Oh, you think it's about power?! This is about you being too fucking outta control! We go around killing people, they're just gonna pile up that many more cops until they catch us. - Okay. You know what, okay, fine. You're the boss, okay? - Yeah? - Yeah. - Yeah? Then take your medicine now. Open your mouth, goddammit. - What for? - So I can see! Yeah. Swallow those motherfucking pills before I kill you, goddammit. (whimpers) Okay, now listen to me! What you did in here has got nothing to do with me! We get pinched, you got a moral duty to let them know you was working strictly solo, you understand? I will fucking kill you if you betray me on this! - Yeah. We ain't get pinched. - Wanna leave here now or what? - What, and go out there and freeze to death? - What, you wanna do more sex shit with them dead people? - No, I wanna clean up, okay? Why don't you just go downstairs and, like, rest your leg 'cause it's probably the last chance you'll get. And I'll just come down later, okay? - [Man] That'll be all for now. Thank you. - [News Anchor] We interrupt this program to bring you the latest news on the prison breakout, live on the scene. - Despite their age and their appearance, I'd have to say these girls are about as dangerous a pair of customers this agency's ever had to contend with. The Garcia girl's a deviant, sexual psychopath. She killed and dismembered her entire family. - [Reporter] What about the Van Meter girl? A lot of people think the system gave her a pretty raw deal. - Excuse me? She burglarized her entire neighborhood. She's a car thief, a drug dealer, an armed robber that specializes in posing as a prostitute. This is not some angel we're talking about. This is a criminal. This is a dangerous felon. - Hey Cyclona, are you coming down?! - Do you think an arrest is imminent? - We've got two possible outcomes, either we find them and we arrest them, or we kill them. - Better hope you don't find me, Mr. Cop. - [News Anchor] We will keep you up to date as this story unfolds. And now, back to tonight's movie. (loud clunk) - Rise and shine, you dirty slut. So, what do you think of my new look? - Think you look like a big dyke. - They're looking for two girls, White Girl. Now anyone asks, you can tell them I'm your little brother. - If I tell them anything, you're just gonna kill them anyway. - I'm not doing that shit no more, remember? How's your leg? - Better. Man, that stuff worked good. - It's 'cause I prayed for you. I found some clothes outside. I think you should wear the scarf. It'll make you look more girly. - What do you care if I look all girly? - The more you look like a girl, the more I feel like a boy. What's for breakfast? - [White Girl] I ate everything. - [Cyclona] Damn, girl. - Well, we better fire this place up and get. - I'm glad we're gonna be together, White Girl. (flames roaring) - [White Girl] Hey, what's that you got there? - Some shit we might need later. I can't believe they had no guns in there. Every white person in the world has a bunch of guns, you know? - Ah, fuck. (loud crash) Give me the keys and shut up, all right? Man, what was he doing under this fucking thing, anyway? I mean, is this car even gonna work? - Fixing the fuel line. It's okay, I took care of it. Jerk. Had it held together with a piece of string. - He was fixing his fuel line? - Look, that's before we talked, okay? I said I wasn't gonna do that shit anymore. - Ah. (loud cracking) God. - [Cyclona] I think you broke his legs. - Ah, I'm so fucking mad at you, goddamn cholo bitch. Stupid, sick ass asshole. (sighs) - Can I talk now? - No. - You wanna beer? You think they're gonna be able to tie us into those people back there? - Oh, you're worried about that now? - Tell me, how does a girl get into barfing? - Look, it's just one subject I'm just not into, okay? What do you wanna get into all that shit for, huh? What, you wanna be entertained? You wanna laugh at what a sick fucking bitch I am? - No. Just so stupid sometimes, I swear. - What do you wanna know for? - 'Cause I love you. Can I not love you? - Look, Cyclona, if I knew white girls barfed, I'd be a millionaire. - So did you do it when you were little? - Remember this one time, my mama was doing county time. Damn, she used to love her crank. I's how come she named me Crystal. Anyhow, I was staying with this foster family. (upbeat hip hop music) That first time, I didn't throw up or nothing. Back then, that would've seem so crazy. (car honks) - Shit, White Girl, shit! (tires screeching) (laughing) (car honks) (laughing) (cars honking) - Yeah! Shit! - Oh shit. Freak. - Got it, got it. - I don't know, White Girl, barfing is just about the worst thing I could ever think of doing. Whenever I throw up, just before, I always get the same image in mind, right before I'm about to heave. Makes me think of the first time I blew my dad. (upbeat mariachi music) (heaves) - Doing your dad definitely qualifies as some memorable shit. I know, I've been there. - Before I threw up, I remember there being these really bright lights and they hurt my eyes so bad. And I never told nobody this, I swear, but there was a flying saucer and beings from another world there and everything. - You're telling me aliens flew all the way down to Earth just to watch you blow your dad? - I'm telling you, I think that they were doing medical experiments on me or something. I remember getting stuck with all these needles, and feeling like I was on dope and shit. And all these probes were going in and out of my body. - I'm not gonna say what all those probes sound like. - And then Sister Gomez was there, making them lights and monster people go away, making me feel all safe. - [White Girl] That's what you brought along? Spray paint? - After the number you did in the kitchen, this is all that was left. Lucky we got this. (can hissing) (inhales) (tires screech) - Oh shit. Oh shit, oh shit, oh shit! - Fuck! - Shit! - Think they saw us. Lie down. - Better fucking hope not! Don't even fucking look at them, Cyclona. Don't even look at their ugly pig faces. - If I had a big fucking gun, I'd blow off his big, fat pig fucking-- - Yeah, but you fucking don't, so just keep your mouth shut and act normal. - I'm gonna piss in my pants if they don't go away. - Oh fuck, man. Crack me another one of those beers, all right? Fuck. Oh, what the fuck's matter with you? - I pissed in my pants, okay? (whimpers) - Cyclona, it's okay. - It's fucked up. Now, I'm gonna smell like pee. You're not gonna tell nobody, are you? - I'd never tell anyone. Look, Cyclona, we're playing for high stakes here. Sometimes when people play for high stakes, they piss their pants. - I know, but it's still embarrassing. - Man, look, come here. Come on now. Get in the car. We've better get, all right? - [Cyclona] Okay. - [White Girl] Hey, you know we were on TV last night. - Was it bad? - It wasn't very nice. How come you never mentioned before that those people you killed just happened to be your family? - 'Cause I like being popular. I was so little the first time my dad got to me that I can't even have no kids. I'm supposed to act normal. This one time in Nogales, I had to go to the hospital and get my guts all stitched up. - You used to live in Mexico? - Yeah, but I ain't exactly no Mexican. - Spick. - Hey, I'm an Apache, okay? - Wah, wah, wah, wah, wah, wah, wah, spick! (chuckles) - Everyone thinks we're all lazy and shit. (laughs) And then when I turned 13, my dad brought us up permanent. Worst thing ever happened to me. - What, moving to the US? - 'Cause we had to leave our church, and I didn't have Sister Gomez standing between me and my dad no more. (can hissing) (inhales) - So you think your dad's why you're all into women? - No way. I was born to eat chocha. - You're drooling. I think if I were to have my face all up in some woman's box, I'd probably barf in it. - Don't talk anymore, White Girl. I'm huffing. Besides, you'd probably barf in anything. (inhales) (inhales) (tires screeching) Shit, White Girl! Holy shit, we're flying! - Fuck! Woo! - [Cyclona] We're flying! (laughing) Wait, I think we're outta beer. (laughs) - Ah shit! Ow! Where are you? (laughing) Come on! Ah! Ah, no more. This ain't hallow. (mumbling) (laughing) Wait, I have paint. (mumbles) (mumbles) Well, we've got two options. We go up the hill, down the hill. Down the hill! (laughing) - [Cyclona] White Girl, you being boss? - Yeah, fuck it, I'll be a boss, bitch! I'm the boss, bitch! - Hey, wait, wait, I got another can of paint! - Ow! Yo, there's a can of paint in my pussy! Bitch. - Yeah, that's it. Girl, I like to keep you out the joint, but you gotta keep your mouth shut. - I know-- - Can't you see that you're your own worst enemy? - I know I fucked up, Mr. Butz. - [Mr. Butz] Oof! - Jeremy Butz? - Yeah, what's up? - My name's Crefilo. This is my partner, Detective Dollar. - Yeah, I recognize you. You're Crystal's arresting officers, right? - You wanna cut that out? This is a courthouse. - Ease up, baby. (sighs) What can I do for you? - Are you aware that Crystal busted outta jail yesterday? - Well, nobody contacted me. - You haven't spoken to her? - I did have a conversation by phone with her yesterday morning to explain the appeal. - Look, neither of us has ever been comfortable with the sentence that Crystal got. - Well, I wish you'd have brought that up during the sentencing phase. - She slashed one of our people with a broken bottle. Do you know what the department would've done to us if we'd come up publicly for her? - She stole a bag of crank from her mama, tried to cash it in, and y'all gave her 25 years? What the fuck kinda country are we living up in here?! - Hey, just spare us the outrage. - Fucking right wing piece of pig shit! This bitch is choking me. - Let him go. Give it up. Come on, here we go. - She's choking me. Bitch is choking me. (gurgling) - Come on. - Let that bitch go! This nigga's about to break you off a piece of some whoop ass! Oh, you didn't know I was a black belt in dim mak, did you? Come on, get you some! - Let it go. You wait over there, okay? - You know, y'all really got to do something about your psychological testing, man, goddamn. - Your client's traveling with a little friend she met in lockup named Angela Garcia. Ever hear of her? - You're talking about that serial killer from Apple Valley? - Garcia bitch has murdered everyone who's ever been close to her. Family, social worker, shot them all in the face. She kills again, your client's going down with her, no doubt about it. - [Cyclona] We're out, totally out. - Good 'cause I think I nearly killed half of my brain cells with huffing all of that shit. - [Cyclona] I'm getting cold. Aren't you getting cold? - Yeah, so let's get away from this fucking water. (train horn wailing) Yo, man, it's close! Come on, let's go for it. (bell tolling) (train horn wailing) (train rumbling) - [Cyclona] You okay? - Just thinking how stupid we're gonna look when we get strapped down for our lethal injections. - Compared to what the state's got planned for us, that hot shot be kindness. - When the state owns your ass, you gotta dance till the state's please you. (chuckles) Gotta light her up. (laughs) Woo! Woo. Well, hello there, children. My name is Larry. - That's Hansel and I'm Gretel, okay? - Well, ain't that fucking cute? Looks like I got me some traveling companions! (barks) (laughs) Do you have any money? - What do you wanna know if we got any money for? - Just so happens that I have something in my little bag of tricks here that might appeal to the lady of the house, some genuine rock, cocaine from California. - We don't need your shit, mister. - Just trying to be friendly and see what I can get. But in the end, I'm gonna take what I need. - You mean you're gonna take what you want? - You are a smart girl. Ain't she smart? You got a smart mouth too, don't you?! Got a little smart mouth! Why don't we get your spick brother over here, pull down them little smarty pants, you can get down on them wobbly wet knees of yours. Yeah, suck my big fucking-- (loud thud) (groans) (loud thuds) (groaning) (loud thuds) - Goddamn! (laughing) - Oh, man, let's go through his fucking shit! (mellow rock music) Finally! Man, it's a good fucking thing he went for his pecker instead of these two things. - Yeah, it's good thing he's so fucking stupid, man! - Oh yes. Oh yes, oh yes, oh yes, indeed. I believe we have some crack cocaine. He was one fun guy, huh? - Yeah, real fun. - Watch out, I think he shit himself. - I have never been able to take that guy on my own. And if I had had another man touching me again, I don't think I would've been able to stand it. I'm never gonna forget you fighting for me. The other person's ever fought for me was Sister Gomez. (sighs) You sleep good, nina. Your angel Cyclona's watching over you tonight. (bell tolling) (train hissing) (suspenseful synthesizer music) (loud clank) - Thought I lost you. - Check it out. - That's soup. - Right on. I got some smokes, some change. - So who'd you kill this time? - Some kind of nightwatchman or something. He was gonna rape me. Wanna eat now? (ethereal synthesizer music) I'm so thirsty! It feels like somebody took a big, greasy shit in my mouth! - Real nice, Cyclona. Here, have some more whisky. - I'm really starting to hate this stuff now. - Gonna die if this train don't stop soon. - Oh shit. Oh Lord, please, please protect us from all the wicked and miserable people lurking in the shadows, seeking to harm me and my bunkie, White Girl. Oh holy Christian protector, Saint Barbara, do not permit any interruption on our journey. And please intercede on our behalf against the police with their guns and their helicopters, and their wicked thoughts and their motherfucking evil intentions. And protect us from all harm. Amen. (ethereal synthesizer and drum music) (bell tolling) - [White Girl] All right, let's do it. What? - I'm not going out there! - Ah shit, what is your problem? - Sister Gomez came to see me last night. - Look, would you just get off the goddamn train? - She told me how this train's taking us to a place of safety. And how if we get off, we're gonna be totally fucked and our souls are gonna belong to Satan. - This train's been rolling for days. I mean, they gotta stop to crew changes or change the fucking gas, whatever the fuck it is they do! - Yeah, but what if we can't find our way back?! - Cyclona, don't worry about it, okay? I got a plan. - You know, these rocks are worthy money. I mean, you could've sold them to some kids. - Yeah, but we need a stash of crack like we need a case of the shits. Besides, I like robbing tricks. It's easier. A lot more satisfying too. - Hey White Girl, I found some water! Why is it all fishy? Tastes like motor oil. - 'Cause it's bad. Blech! Wash it down with some of that. Maybe it'll help kill the germs. - Can we go back now, please? We're gonna get all sick from this bad dog water. - [White Girl] Come on. (upbeat guitar and harmonica music) - [Cyclona] All the rocks are gone. What do you think could've happened to them? - [White Girl] Just calm down, okay? - Well, where are they? - How about they're around the corner and not be a butt, Cyclona? - We're totally fucked. We're totally fucked. We're doomed. - Holy shit. Just shut your mouth already, okay?! God! If you can keep from being completely crazy, then I promise you everything will be okay, all right?! - I got the mark of the beast and now they're gonna put me in one of their cages for sure! - [White Girl] Come look at me. Stop running around! - I can't, I got the walkies. I got the walkies and I just can't stop! - [White Girl] Look, you've lots of time, okay?! - If I get pinched, you gotta kill me first, okay? You can't let them get to me! - I won't let them get you, okay? - Swear to me that you'll kill me first, okay? Otherwise, you can just go fuck yourself! - Look, I swear! I'll kill you, I promise. Let's get the fuck outta here! (ominous synthesizer music) - It's the border patrol! That must be Mexico down there! I told you that train was taking us some place special. (siren wails) - Hey officer, what's up? - The hell you girls doing out here? (gun clicks) - Don't move! Don't you fucking move! - Take it easy. - Get their guns. Yo, put your hands behind your head now! You wanna get shot, goddammit? - Let me have your backup! - I don't have a-- - All you puto crackers all have backups, I've seen it on TV! Now let me have it! - Listen, I don't have a backup. I don't-- (gun firing) - No! - You're such a pussy, White Girl. See, he could've raped us with that-- - See, I'm gonna kill you for that! (loud thuds) Get on up, you psycho bitch! Get on up so I can fucking kill you! (screaming) Get on up, you fucking psycho! (police radio chattering) (ominous synthesizer music) You see that? - [Cyclona] If we stay here, our lives are over, White Girl. We gotta go to Mexico right now. Are you ready for that? - Yeah. Let's do it. (sirens wailing) Come on! Come on, give me your hand. - Oh, we're here! Oh, we're actually here! - Man, what do you think, the law ain't gonna be after us just 'cause we're in Mexico?! - [Cyclona] Trust me, it ain't gonna be like up north! - Come on. - God. Really beat the shit outta me, White Girl. My face still hurts. - Couldn't do worse. What were you thinking going off like that? - I wasn't thinking. I was coming. I must've got off five or six times. - Ah God. Ah Jesus. - I'm a big pervert, huh? - I really don't wanna hear it, okay? - Made my chocha so wet, even through the Stelazine. And let me tell you, it's hard getting wet behind that Stelazine shit. - Better shut up. - Why am I like that? - 'Cause you're a piece of shit. Now shut up. How much money you get off of them old people? - Who me? - How much, goddammit? - $400 maybe. - When were you planning on telling me? - I don't know, I woulda though. - Yeah, right. How well you know this shithole, Cyclona? - Hey, I know Tijuana like I know myself. And it ain't a shithole! Shouldn't be so negative. Are you gonna break my head now? (upbeat mariachi music) (loud crash) (yelling in foreign language) (upbeat mariachi music) - Feels weird not worrying about no cops getting up in my face. - I know! It even smells different. (inhales) - Yeah, it smells like garbage and dog shit. - Oh, you're wrong. It smells like freedom. This is your country now, White Girl. You gotta look at her. You gotta look at her, you gotta love her. Now, come on, let's get something to eat. And no barfing 'cause you don't need to do that no more. You're the one in control now. (speaking in foreign language) I can't wait to show you Tijuana tomorrow, White Girl. We'll buy some new clothes. We'll get our hair done. We'll have a really nice lunch. Check it out. Gonna go for it? - Well, I figured I'd do the usual number on them. - Oh, come on. We need the money. Fuck that shit! We're in TJ now! - Take them, goddammit. (coughing) Okay? Let's do some fucking work. (loud whacks) - White Girl, come on! We're sleeping in a real bed tonight! (sighs) Feels good, don't it? - Yeah, feels good. - What are you thinking about? - I haven't been fucked in nearly two years. - Maybe you'll like the guys in Mexico. I mean, they got nice manners. I guess they're kinda cute. - Nah, it won't work. I only date black guys. - How come you only date black guys? - Both hate white men.

I understand your client escaped from custody and is suspect in several brutal murders. - Your Honor, that is not an established fact. - Sit down! Makes me sick to do this, it really does. Nevertheless, despite overwhelming evidence pointing to her guilt, it is the decision of this court that the convictions of Crystal Van Meter in the California Superior Court are hereby reversed. (chuckles) And I remind you, sir, your client has been freed on purely a technicality. - You don't have to tell me twice. Yes siree do, Bob. (laughs) - Think this dress is tight enough? Damn, I better not fart or I'll blow my shoes off. - What are you, crazy? All the hookers in TJ wear stuff like that. - You got no sense of humor at all, you know that? - Look, you wanna rob tricks, you gotta blend in.

Oh my God. Oh my God, White Girl. It's Sister Gomez. She's here in Tijuana. We don't gotta go to Nogales or nothing. (sighs) I knew that train was taking us some place special. - [Detective Dollar] Are these the two females you saw? - That's the white girl. I can't be sure about the other one, but I'm pretty sure she was the shooter. She blew those agents away. Then the white girl get mad, beat the living shit out of her. - What do you think? - I think we're going to Tijuana. - I'm so excited! I can't believe it! (tapping) (grunts) We're looking for Sister Gomez. (growling) (loud thud) Don't fuck with me or I'll kick your monkey ass all over the street!

(loud thud) (groans) (speaks in foreign language) (grunts) (groans) (loud thud) (groans) - Look around, is sleepy. (speaking in foreign language) Go to sleep. Go to bed, little mice. - Oh my God, Sister Gomez. It's me. Angela Garcia. Don't you remember me? - Is you? My little movie star. Where have you been? - She used to call me her little movie star when I was little. - Hi, my name is Crystal, mostly called White Girl. - Check it out. She's looking into your soul. - You have a demon inside you, little gringa. And your demon is a hungry demon, which is never ever satisfied. - Told you she'd take care of your shit. - And your demon is angry demon, which is thirsty for the blood of the human being. - Can you help me? Can you intercede with Saint Jude and make my life bearable again? - Oh, si, si, si, but first, you no bring something for me? - This is all we've got right now, but we can get more. I beseech you, Sister Gomez. We need a place of sanctuary where we'll be safe from the police. - You run from the policia? You have done many, many bad things, my child, but I saw your demon. - When can you start? - Your demon must be kept in bondage, and you will suffer greatly, but when we finish, your demon will go back to his true home, in the darkness. - What about my bunkie, White Girl? - Your little gringa's friend is a hungry demon. Must be fed. Mucho, mucho, mucho. And when it is satisfied and off his guard, we can send it into the darkness too. - I don't know, Sister. Her demon can eat so much. You gotta see it to believe it. - Trust Sister Gomez. She know what to do. - The little mice come to me with the hunger in their tummies. I feed them with many cakes and pies. I know I ask nothing for me. To keep their tummies full cost mucho dinero. - We can make so much money. - Not you. You must stay within these walls once sexo season begins, my pretty, pretty bunny. - White Girl could get you the money. You could do that, couldn't you? - I guess. (upbeat mariachi music) (singing in foreign language) (speaking in foreign language) - Oh, hey, Mr. Mexican, wanna get some frenching going? - Gringa, (speaking in foreign language). - Si, Americano. Muy bueno. (speaking in foreign language) - Oh yeah, blonde pussy, all soft and wet and yummy. Taste just like candy. Oh, and I need something to put inside it so bad!

(gun fires) Okay, now let me see your wiener! (loud whack) (loud thud) (groans) (knocking) - Oh, you are very good at the making of the money, no? - Huh, yeah, had a lot of practice. - How much you keep for yourself? - [White Girl] About $300. - You think it's right you keep this money? (gentle guitar music) - I'll bust you open like a goddamn watermelon. - Come, sit down, little gringa. It's time now. (speaks in foreign language) This is for you and your hungry demon. - Where's Cyclona? - You just think about the wonderful (speaks in foreign language). Sweet, creamy butter, fresh milk from a jet black goat, the finest pork, the rarest red and green chilis, and my special flan. Shows from (speaks in foreign language). In ingles. - Thanks a lot. - [News Anchor] Authorities now believe the two escapees from the California Youth Authority, Angela Garcia and Crystal Van Meter, are responsible for the shooting deaths of those two INS agents outside of San Diego yesterday. - [Mr. Butz] I have no doubt that my client will be exonerated, that she was last week by the Court of Appeals. - [Reporter] Have you heard from Crystal since her escape? - [Mr. Butz] No, I have not. - [Reporter] In the hope your client is watching this program, is there anything you'd like to say to her? - Crystal, baby, sister came through for us, girl. (chuckles) Come on home now! It's time to stop running, turn yourself in! Don't do this to yourself, baby. Let's let the healing begin, okay? Anymore questions? All right, get the camera outta my face, man. - No-- (TV clicks) - You enjoy my sweet pork, little gringa? - Right now, I wanna see Cyclona, so let's cut the bullshit, okay? - She struggling to save her soul. You no see her now. - Shit. - I clean up here. We have big day tomorrow. - What's up for tomorrow? - You must continue to feed, but you must no throw up. - You want me to eat like this everyday? - Then the demon will be careless and stick his head out from your tummy. And we can pull on his head till he's out of your stomach. - How much weight are we talking about here? - Many kilos. But many senors like the heavy woman, so choose to be prostitute. Come, little gringa. You must go on the scale. (burps) (groans) (burps) (burps) Come, hungry one. (burps) - You know, back in jail, I got kinda allergic to having people tell me what to eat and weigh me out like some kind an animal. - [Sister Gomez] You know what may help, little hungry one? - I don't wanna be bulimic no more. (ethereal synthesizer music) I just wanna be pretty. - Oh. (speaks in foreign language) Go on the scale. Good. Flacco? - [Flacco] Si. - Flacco will take you to your room. He will give you some water and vinegar, and you can clean your little white chocha. (Flacco speaks in foreign language) - Hey, I didn't fuck nobody out there, okay? (speaks in foreign language) I didn't fuck nobody! Hey! (lock clicks) Hey, what the hell?! (gasps) (gurgles) (heaving) - The gringo was seen last night at La Adelitas. Many men reported being robbed by a young Americana, promising a night of very, very good sex. - We'd like to be part of your investigation. - We'll show you how we treat the criminals here in Mexico, huh? - Wait, hold up. What, you just gonna shoot them? - Do you want no shoot? - No, we don't wanna shoot. - I'm carrying a weapon. You got a problem with that? - Si. It's passable, you know? No problem. (chuckles) (Sister Gomez humming) - [White Girl] Why'd you lock me up last night? - [Sister Gomez] It is muy necessary to contain your demon. - Look, lady, I wanna see Cyclona, and I wanna see her now. - Tonight, you can bring more (speaks in foreign language), then I make you my delicious tamales. They are the finest in all of Baha. - Why can't you talk straight for just one second? - Why you care so much for my baby Angela? There's nothing you can do for her. Why you not just walk away? - Mm. 'Cause I feel like I owe her something. (clapping) - Gracias, gracias, (speaks in foreign language). Gracias. We are Mexicanos, beloved of the Gods. We have the second sight, which no other people possesses. We see backwards and forward in the time. And we know in the most natural properties that everything is connected, our future and our past. (clapping) - How you like my country, senor? - There sure a lot of whores. There she is. - [Crefilo] Let's do it. - No, no, we wait, senor, because there's two criminals. We watch, we follow, then we catch them both. - Here she comes. - [Officer] Now she rob him. - That has not been established as fact. - Yeah, right. - It's true, we watch. - Oh. Gracias. Adios. Gracias. Muy mucho, mucho gracias, senor. Mucho gracias. (knocking) (speaking in foreign language) (door clacks) - (speaks in foreign language), senor. First, we go for the backup, okay? (speaking in foreign language) (sighs) - You bring something for me? Oh. (sighs) (sighs) Money? - [White Girl] Where'd all the kids go? - No more little mice. (gasps) (ominous synthesizer music) (whimpering) (speaking in foreign language) (yelling in foreign language) - Go! (yelling in foreign language) (yelling in foreign language) Go! (yelling in foreign language) (suspenseful orchestral music) Oh shit. Just hold on. White Girl. It's me. (whimpering) It's me, White Girl, Cyclona. Calm down. Calm down. Okay, it's okay. Shh. Shh. Shh. (whimpering) Come here. Come on. It's okay. (whimpering) - She's a cannibal, White Girl. She killed these two kids right in front of me and she was gonna feed them to you. She was gonna make tamales (speaking in foreign language). (groans) She was gonna try and make you fat, and when you couldn't get fat no more, she was gonna make you into gordita tamales. (whimpers) She beat the fuck outta me with this whip and she made me watch all these videos of all these guys molesting me when I was little. - That's why she always called you her little movie star. That's what you were! And all those lights and shit you're always talking about, what do you think all this shit is?! That flying saucer and all those fucking aliens, fuck, man! Damn, this is where it all started! This is where she worked you so you'd get fucked by a bunch of suck ass grownups. She was making videos and selling them to perverts. You and me are gonna go upstairs and kill everybody. You ready for that? - I can't. I'm scared of her. - Don't be scared no more. (gun fires) (shrieking) Come on, get the fuck outta here. (speaking in foreign language) (panting) (dog growls) (chattering) (guns click) (speaking in foreign language) You people lived way too long. - I have lived 1,000 centuries, and I will live 1,000 more. You think you are a killer? - Bitch, I am a minister of death. (upbeat mariachi music) (guns firing) (laughing) - [Cyclona] Watch out, White Girl! (gun fires) (groans) (laughing) (sirens wailing) (loud whack) - There's your Sister Gomez! Fucking a pecker, goddammit! She's a man! She's a man! - I trusted you so much! - My little movie star. - You fucking hell cunt! (loud whack) (dog barking) (grunting) (loud whacks) (sirens wailing) Help me drag this bitch, Cyclona. (grunts) Why'd you kill all them kids, huh?! Why'd you kill all them kids?! Why'd you kill all them kids?! - They're muy necessary for the sexo and the blood. - You piece of shit! I'm gonna ruin you for what you did, you hear?! I'm gonna ruin you! (grunts) She's a cannibal, right? - She chopped up them kids right in front of me so she could make them into tamales! - Ah, in the fucking oven she goes! (upbeat mariachi music) (grunting) - [Sister Gomez] No, no. (grunting) - [White Girl] Piece of shit! - My baby Angela, you'll do this thing to me? My father, Jupiter, will send many armies to put you to your death! No! (flames roaring) (screaming) - Roast in peace. (speaking in foreign language) - What a trip, huh? - [White Girl] At least now you know how you got so fucked up. - It was her, huh? - She played her part. Your fucked up family did the rest. It was right to kill your family, Cyclona. - Nobody ever told me that before. - Once you started, you couldn't stop. It's not your fault. It's natural what you did. I would've done the same. - [Officer] Come out with your hands on your head now! (gasps) - I hear pigs outside. What do the pigs want? - What do you think they want? - Remember what you promised me? Remember you promised me that you weren't gonna let them put me in one of their little cages? - [Officer] Come out with your hands over your head now! - Maybe we can shoot our way out. - I don't give a fuck no more, Crystal. I'm ready for my new life. Maybe in Nueva, La Soloca this time! (crying) (mellow rock music) Don't worry about it, Crystal. In my new life, I have wings! And claws! (whimpering) I look good, huh, (speaks in foreign language)? (ominous synthesizer music) (gun clicks) (gun fires) (mellow guitar music) - [Officer] Come out with your hands over your head now! (loud thuds) (loud crash) (speaking in foreign language) (gun clicks) - Don't move, you motherfucking pig. Don't you fucking move. (ominous synthesizer music) Tell them to put their guns down now. - You don't escape from here, gringita. - I know that. I just wanna talk about a deal. You motherfuckers know how to deal, don't you? (guns clacking) (mellow guitar music) (crying) - Many bodies in (speaks in foreign language), huh? Sister Gomez, she was a man who was eating human beings. She committed suicide in the oven. - What about the Garcia girl? - Shot to death with a (speaks in foreign language). But before she die, she make a declaration of murders, make all the murders in the (speaks in foreign language). The gringa is very, very innocent, you know? Hero for a time. - You aren't gonna hold her? - The man she robbed, after promising a night of very, very good sex, you know, they got familias. They no testify, so there's no reason to keep her. - Crystal, how you doing, baby doll? - Hi. I'm okay, how are you? Hey Detective Dollar. Hey Detective Crefilo. How you all doing? - Hello Crystal. You thirsty? You hungry? You want something to eat? - Nah. (dog growls) (dog growls) I ain't hungry no more.
