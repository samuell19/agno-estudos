Zanot, do you read me? Shit! -Don't move! Police! -Don't worry, I'm a cop too. What the hell is going on here? Let me show you my badge. Put your hands in the air! The little one. See that car there? Let's get you onto the car. Gently… Gently! All right? My car… It's the Renault 25. Will you be okay? Up there. Hurry! -Well? -Get out of here. Did you find it? Get out of here! Shit! Asshole! Got a cigarette? You're hurt. It's nothing. Occupational hazard? I'm not a thief. Petit, are you there? Hey, Petit? Damn it. Answer me. That wasn't my fault! Can't you read? It says, "Stop!" I need to get this man to the hospital. -Is he hurt? -God damn it. Sir, we need to report this. Hello? Sir? -There's a guy bleeding out in here! -Don't yell at me! Calm down! -Here. -Give me your phone number then. Give me your details, and I'll leave. Police. We're taking your car. You can't take my car. Come on. Hey! What am I supposed to you? You can't just leave me out here! Shit. What happened? Sophie, find an OR. -Blood pressure 84. -Pulse 130. Pulse 130. I need you to go to the station for me. Tell them where I am. Christian Monge. O-positive. Did you hear that? He's O-positive. Come on, hurry up! You come too. We'll take a look at that hand. Nathalie, take care of the younger one, please. How did you do it? I caught it on something. It could get infected, you know. I can't let you live like this. Thank you. -Nathalie, can I see you for a second? -I'll be right there. Nathalie. That's a pretty name. You can stay there. Did you know it was a gunshot wound? I'm obliged to detain you. Nathalie, if you don't mind. All right. You should be fine. There's a coffee machine over there. THE SAND FIDDLE TOMORROW'S PRESIDENT? Laurence? -What do you want? -How's it going? So you do know how to talk to girls. Is he in? -Who? Your father? -Yeah. He's coming back from Moscow. Didn't his beloved Koksis die? It's Kosicz. And that's not funny, you know. He was attacked. He almost died. We're all very concerned. Cup of coffee? I don't have time. Not even an espresso? No coffee. Not now. Not with you. Is that clear? Is she making your life a misery? Have you even slept? You look terrible. Did you go all out for your birthday? Yeah, all out, for sure. Inspector. What do you have that for? Was it a gift? Don't be a dick. Just drop it. What kind of bullshit are you on this time? You need to visit the printer and pick up the film. No, not that. Come on. Your dad said so. My dad's a pain in the ass! I'm so sick of this stupid job. Go on, say that to his face. When you get to where he is. I don't believe in God, is that it? Then don't do as he tells you. You infidel. Listen, my dad isn't innocent. Just take a look in his desk drawers. "Just take a look in his desk drawers." I wish. -Shit. -What? My lighter. Damn it. You're having a great start to the week. Hey! Don't forget about the printer! I'm here to see Kaufmann. Do you have an appointment? I'm from the house. Do you work here? No, the house. He's my father. Go ahead. -Yes? -It's me. -The prodigal son returns. -I need something. Open up. Shouldn't you be at the printer? Are you in trouble? You were 30 years ago, right? Actually, it was my birthday yesterday. I'm sorry. I forgot. Come in. The police have been here all morning. Your father, an endangered publisher. Imagine that. But you wouldn't care, in any case. It isn't your fight. Yeah. A lost generation, without ideals, I know. Exactly. Without ideals. What do you think of your life? You come, you go. You're all the same. You have everything, you take advantage of everything, and you never question it. But you're right. If you believe in nothing, and nothing will happen. Yes? No. He's not doing it. It's canceled. There's just the reception in Buttes-Chaumont. Yes. At two o'clock. Right. See you tomorrow. What are you doing snooping around? I left something in the garage. The garage? Go on then. Hurry up. I need to get going. FREE THE WRITERS JOSEF KOSICZ: PARIS' WRITER CANDIDATE Taking an interest in the world around you? -Did you find it? -No. Well, back to work. I'm not paying you to read the papers. Here, give this to Laurence. -Laurence. -Go on, get out of here. I'm sorry about your colleague. My colleague? Where'd you get that? I need to speak with you. It's important. Not now. I need to see him. He died. Last night. You didn't know? I'll wait for you at the station. At the front entrance. At one o'clock. One o'clock. Hey! Wait! Everyone's been looking all over for you. You shouldn't have taken your bandage off. Aren't you gonna get that? I'm busy. Can I see your ticket, please? Thanks. Sorry about that. -Have a nice day. -You too. Stop blocking the entrance, please! Are you looking for something? I'm waiting for someone. Well, you can't stay here. -Sorry, I just-- -You can't stay here! Off you go. All right. Fine! Is this allowed? Come on. -Did you hurt your hand? -Yeah. -Do you think they'll let us in there? -Let's go. Where are you from? I was born in Lithuania. Do you know where Lithuania is? The French tend to be pretty bad at geography. Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania. The Baltic countries. Did you learn French going through customs? I wasn't raised over there. I grew up in Switzerland. I thought you couldn't leave the USSR before. That's funny. You ask the same questions as Monge. Are you giving the same answers? Listen to me. Christian… Monge agreed to help me recover some crucial documents. He was on the verge of finding them. And now he's dead. What kind of documents? Why should I trust you? I don't even know your name. It's Alissa. Don't you care what my name is? You're Luc, right? What happened? Who killed him? I can't tell you anything. That's top secret. -You know what? -What? -Nothing. -Tell me! Can I have my lighter back? Luc, I need you to help me. Give it back, and we'll see. Is that all you care about? Your lighter? Here. That's what I think of your lighter. That's my lighter! I don't believe this. No way. Damn it. Am I interrupting? Practicing for a test? Yeah, I'm sick of this place. I'm joining the police. Are you sure you're big enough? Can you piss without hands? Asshole! -You can't be here. -Don't touch me! Okay. You need to leave. Out. -I'll be back later. -Yeah, OK. What a pain in the ass! Who is she? Some Russian chick. I don't know. She's desperate to see your dad. She's been here twice already. She's a real nuisance. What's with the face, Columbo? Hello. Did you guys order pizza? Yeah. One royal and one calzone. Come. I'll pay you. Hey, Mariolo! Your pizzas are getting cold. Yeah, thanks. You should wear a helmet. This isn't Naples. What about your seatbelt? I'll tell you where to shove my seatbelt. Hey, Mariolo. Okay? -Okay. -Now get going. It's green. Go! All right. I'm going to be working late tonight. Are you all right? Who's that? So you want to play cop with me? There's something about your story I don't get. There's nothing to understand! You have nothing, you know nothing, so leave me alone! Don't speak to me like that. Alissa, who is this guy? I'll explain later. Were you with him last night? Vera, please. This is not the time! Okay? I'm sorry. That's Vera. A friend of mine. ‪She's having a hard time here in France. I can see that. Can we go for a walk? I was there that night when Monge got shot. You were there? Pierre Kaufmann, the editor. He's the one who has the documents I need. Kaufmann? Monge was sure they were hiding in his house. -He never said anything to you? -No, nothing. Why were you there then? I followed him. Did you have a bad feeling about him? ‪Yeah, that's right. Luc, we have to go back there. I'm a cop, not a thief. Then I'll go alone. Luc, don't leave me. I need you. I need you too. Shall we? Is this yours? No. I stole it so I could follow you. Did you enjoy that? Machine. He's not home. Do you know his number by heart? Yeah, it's my job. Wait for me here. That's disgusting. It's fine. -Can you put something else on? -I'm trying to listen. Any updates since yesterday? No, nothing. If you ask me, they're making a real mess of it. Of course they are. Shit. -Goodnight. -Goodnight, sir. How rich do you think he is anyway? Mr. Kaufmann! Mr. Kaufmann! Who's that? I didn't see anyone before. I absolutely must speak to Josef Kosicz. It's imperative. -Mr. Kaufmann, please! -Miss. This is unbelievable! I have a private life. You have no right to be here. ‪-Miss, you can’t be here. ‪-Please! That's it. Do your job! See how it's done? Keep a cool head. Stay calm. This is ridiculous. PIERRE KAUFMANN MARS TOWER, PARIS I don't believe this! Can't I get some peace and quiet for once? What are you doing here? What about you? Printing your next book? Honestly, this is unbelievable. You don't belong here! I'm your son, aren't I? No way. You will never set foot here again, got it? Get out! -Good night, Laurence. -Enough! Out! Keep your eyes open. I'm not kidding. What's this guy doing here? Did you see him go in? What's the matter with you? That's his son! His son? Yes! The Kaufmann boy. I can't remember his name. -Are you sure? -Very sure. More than sure. Are you satisfied? Well? Here it is. God damn it. -What do you want? -Where is she? Why are you here? Tell me, or I'll have you deported! Stupid French cop. Try that again, and I'll eat you alive! ‪Come here. That's none of your business! Are you sure this is your bike? It's all right. She's with me. Are you okay? What's going on? ‪NATIONAL POLICE Do you think you're Superman or something? You guys watch way too much TV. Do you have a rogatory errand? Anything at all? You'd better come with us so we can check. Are you an investigating officer? Who's your superior? Your sector? Come on, guys. I told you. She's with me. Look at him! Don't give me that face, buddy. We just like to rile you guys up a bit. We'll leave you to it. Miss. You shouldn't take others' mail. Can we go, please? -Who's that? -He helped me. -Hello. -Hello. Irina Danayev. Hi. Thank you for helping Alissa. These documents are crucial to us. Who are you exactly? He's a police officer. A police officer? What's in the documents? It has nothing to do with the French police. I'm not too sure about that. Apart from organized theft, what is it that you do? I'm a lawyer. This wasn't theft. These documents are part of a file I'm responsible for. Oh, yeah? Then let's see what's in them. All right. Let's go. But I warn you, what's in there, as you say, falls under international law. Which clearly is beyond your competencies. We'll see about that. Everything is in order. We can take a look. Wait! I don’t want you to ever see him again. Alissa! Irina? No, she can’t come to the phone right now. Are you at home? Give me your number. I’ll just write it down. Hold on, let me get a pen. Let me write that down. Nine, four… Four, two… Nineteen… Three, six… One, five. Will you be in all evening? Until six o’clock? OK. I’ll have her call you back by six. By six o’clock. All right, then. A priori, everything’s going well. Do you want some? You haven't eaten since yesterday. They're really good. What's with the tape? Help me out here. Say something. Why is Kaufmann involved in all this? One answer, one French fry. Do you want me to get down on my hands and knees? I have to see him. Who? Kosicz. Do you want to see him? We have to report him. He's my father. Do you want to try? Where did you learn how to do that? I served in the Red Army. Do you want to try? No. Are you afraid? Are you sure? Your father's a star, huh? This crowd could be here for anything. Have you stopped speaking again? Why are we wasting our time here? You could call him. I don't have his number. How long has it been? What does it matter? I'm not giving you my life story. That's a shame. All right, coming through. I'm not Madonna. -Let him through! -Let him through. Josef Kosicz doesn't owe you anything. It's all right. It's good to be here in Paris, France, after so many years. It's been a long time. I wish to thank the French government. My publisher. Thanks also to the press. We have to face the dark side. I'm very determined, as I know you are. There is no democracy. If there is only weakness. To face the oppression. Thank you very much. I am a free man! Laurence? Luc? This is impossible. They're crazy! He's still alive! Your father's looking for you. Where are they? -What? -Which hotel? What do you want to do? Tell me, which hotel? They're at the Sofitel, but you can't go. Luc, wait! You can't! -Are you okay? -What did she say? Come on. Wait. Let me do it. Sofitel, how may I help you? Is Joseph Kosicz here? What's it about? I'm Kaufman's son. The editor. So what? Can I see him? No. But I work for my father. You could work for mine, the answer is still "no." You have a nice day now. Kind of an asshole, huh? Let him do what he wants. He can kiss my ass. Sorry. -Which floor? -Twenty-two, please. Are you okay? Go that way. I'll meet you upstairs. What did you do? Do you think this is funny? If I squeeze here, I can kill you. Do you realize that? Answer me. I can't hear you. Why did you shoot so close? You almost killed me. Moron. What about the journalist? Did you do that on purpose? What am I doing with him? We let it happen. My God. ‪Take care of him. What are you doing here? Police. Do you think I'm an idiot? Let him go. Did you hear her? All right. How was I supposed to know? Shit, you're a pain in the ass! -Are you okay? -Yes. Did you see him? No, they're on high alert. We need to get out of here. Wait, come with me. What are you doing with that? It's for my own protection. Monge loaned it to me, just in case. "Just in case"? You're lying. So are you. We make a good team then. Where are you staying tonight? At Vera's. In her bed? Are you jealous? I can take you home with me. -No. -I have a view of the Eiffel Tower. No. After you. Not like Switzerland, huh? Don't you carry a gun? No, I signed the Non-Proliferation Treaty. You're probably the only one. You're doing pretty well. Yeah, I know. I meant as a police officer. Yeah, that too. Where did you get the badge? Monge loaned it to me, "just in case." Am I fired? Not yet. Turn around. Move over. Your father's a great writer. It's so sad and empty here. It was my mother's apartment. -I'm going to leave. -Where will you go? Home with you. I'll ask your father for your hand. We don't even know one another. I'll take care of it. How will you manage? I need to be alone with him, one on one. Yes, boss. ‪Good night. Ten o'clock, Paris City Hall. Too late. Mass on Rue Daru… Canceled. Two o'clock, Russian Embassy. That needs a capital "R." Thank you. Six o'clock, press conference at the National School of Chemistry. -I'm doing my best. -You’re sweet. Eight o'clock, Parc des Princes… There's a soccer match. Do you know where he's eating? Do you know all of this is top secret, Columbo? No kidding. I don't know what you're thinking. You're not dragging us into some bullshit, are you? Not just some bullshit. A whole load of it. Where's the tape? I don't have it on me, Irina. You can search me. What did you do with it? -Come on! -Hang on, I-- No arguing! Come with us. All right, I'm coming. I said I'm coming! You're a liar and a thief. Do you say mass at that church? That church? It's seen a lot of things. Before the wall fell, we helped dissidents in the Soviet bloc. Now we're trying to open investigations against the former leaders of the political police. It's very difficult. Now you know the significance of that tape, you can give it back. Why did Kaufmann have it? Do you mean your father? It was you in the photograph. What photograph? In front of the Soviet Embassy. Did he keep that? Your father helped us a long time ago. He believed in certain things. And then… His career changed all of that. Luc, one last time, where is that tape? -He's holding it against Kosicz. -Where is it? It's been destroyed. That's impossible. I don't believe you! We've locked people up. We've burned manuscripts. People are dead! It's our past, our life! You don't know anything about this. What right do you have to meddle in it? Did you want to hurt your father? You can destroy evidence, but you can never destroy the truth. Who is Alissa? The daughter of a great writer. NATIONAL SCHOOL OF CHEMISTRY, PHYSICS AND BIOLOGY Where is he? You could at least say hello. -Hello. Where is he? -At the end of the hall. Wait. He's with Kosicz! Are you all right? It's fine. He can go. I don't know what's gotten into him lately. ‪Shut up. ‪Excuse me. -No smoking. -Sorry. How's it going? Nothing extravagant tonight. Let's stick to the plan. Who do you think you're talking to, Kaufmann? Don't use that tone with me. You can drop the act. Don't forget what I have on you. If I so decide it, Josef Kosicz is finished. Would you really kill the goose that lays the golden eggs? Not if it stays in my coop. It's pretty cramped in your coop. And it stinks. Leave it. I'll do it myself. Dirty Jew. Without me, you're dead. You seem less sure of that than usual. Meditation exercise. I'm not used to having my life under threat. What are you exactly? DGES? DTS? A cop? -Police. -Police? And yet you're walking around like this unarmed? Aren't you afraid? An officer without a weapon is like a knife without a blade, as we say. Is there something you want to tell me? Reveal your secrets. Who is the man you shot? Which one? I saw you on video. That wasn't a pen in your hand. A blast from the past. Where is this video you speak of? What do you want from me? Do you think I'm going to get down on my knees and beg? What is it you know, little cop? Anyway, there's nothing more anyone can do to me now. I've got them by the balls. They'll be ridiculed if they let that slip. Their writer-candidate, a murderer! Funny, isn't it? I'm sorry. Why do you think they're protecting me? Think about it, little cop. You don't know what power is. You have your badge, your gun. That must give you a little hard-on. Real power is something else. Off you go, and you can stick that tape up your ass. How can you write what you write, and… Where's that tape? Your daughter has it in a safe place. -My daughter? -Yes. She's here in Paris. She wants to see you. You're very difficult to get hold of, Mr. Kosicz. Here? In Paris? Does she want to see me? Why now? How do I know you're telling the truth anyway? -You don't. -I don’t. Where did she get the tape? From Kaufmann? Of course. What has she said about me? How is she? I think she's afraid of you. Does she know something? About who you really are? I'd be surprised. We cut pages and pages. They said, "Your writing style is too harsh, too sharp." But we could always discuss it. The conflict with censorship is difficult when a book is weak. If a work is of great quality, there are no problems. Are you saying that the censors loved literature? Of course! Censors are not necessarily uncultured boors. I've met many who are incredibly refined. Mr. Kosicz, it's been rumored that you're leaving the Pierre Kaufmann publishing house. That would delight many people in the industry but that is, of course, false. I categorically deny that and-- Pierre Kaufmann was brave enough to publish me. He took that risk. He will always be a hero to me. No. But I indeed made the decision to respond favorably to the offer Grasset Publishers made me. I would like to take this opportunity to announce the news officially. Senella Roux from Libération. What's your relationship like with the former dissidents? Your name doesn't appear in their memoirs. After Gorbachev, not only did we change regimes, we also changed our memory. That wasn't what I asked. That is my answer. Anna Poninska from Le Monde. How has the recent attack you suffered inspired you to reflect upon? Violence. He got scared! ‪Wait! Violence is first and foremost an act against those who exercise it. It is therefore also a meditation on humankind, on ourselves. Is that the paradox you wished to express in The Sand Fiddle? Absolutely not. -I do have some qualms-- -No! About imposing this terrible book on you. You KGB bastard! ‪They’re going to find out! You’ll be sued! ‪What are you telling them? ‪You think no one knows? Sergey Rozanov ! ‪KGB scum! Let go of me! Ladies and gentlemen, we apologize for that incident. We'll continue to take questions. Luc! Give me that tape immediately. Never. Give it to me! Everyone's obsessed with that tape. This is not a joke, Luc! It's all right. He's my father. What do you want with it? I don't know. TF1, CANAL, what do you think? They won't run it. You didn't tell me you needed a stepping stone to succeed. What do you know about life? You can't even earn your own living. I'd rather lose it than be like you. "Die or lie." Céline wrote that. Don't start with the quotes. You always have a story ready. You're 30 years old, Luc. Isn't it a little late to kill your father? Pierre? Why are you publishing a murderer? I don't need to take lessons from you! I don't give a damn what you think. Live your life, then you'll see! You got it. -Pierre! -I'm coming. You have until tonight! You don't scare me. Have you read the book they're promoting? No. -Or any of his work? -No. That's a shame. It's great stuff. It's an incredible story. Wait. Irina? You've lost. We've all lost. Let me explain. It's over now, Pierre. Excuse me, sir. -Want some? -No. Hello? It's me. I spoke to him. He wants to see you. Are you listening? Yes, I'm listening. Is that all you can say? You sound odd. You okay? We're meeting at the Parc des Princes. Meet me by the main entrance, Porte d'Auteuil. Okay. See you in an hour. Are you sure you're okay? See you later, Luc. "See you later, Luc." Damn, maybe I was too harsh. What’s the matter? What’s wrong? Where are you going? Please… Don’t go. Stay here, with me. Alissa! Vera, I have to go. You won't see me again. Where are you going? To see him? -Do you love him? -Vera. -Do you love him? Is that it? -Yes! You’re lying! I know you’re lying! Go on. I know where you’re going and what you’re going to do! I'm going alone. We agreed that I would show up first. If not, he'll be suspicious. This is between him and me. Let me go. You can't just drop me like that. I'm on your side. You're on my side? No, I'm a diehard PSG fan. -No matter what? -No matter what. So young man! What's the score? One-zero for PSG. Is Vera with you? Vera? You'll pay for what you did to my father! Your father? Who are you? Veluskas. Alissa Veluskas. Let's get out of here. Let's go! Come on! What the hell is this? Having a little party? Don't you dare move. -Two cops, two dead. -Let’s get out of here! ‪Does that ring any bells? Stop! Police! Who are these clowns? Stop! Don't mind me. I'll be back soon. Apply pressure to the wound. -Give me the keys. -OK. -The keys! -OK. And the cigarettes. Be careful with the car. No! Not the car, please! Why would you shoot? Do you know how much a car like that costs? I don't care. What do I do now? Don't worry about it. Just file a complaint. -All right. -And don't be a pain in the ass. My father was a literature professor in Vilnius. He was a writer. His manuscripts were confiscated. When things turned nasty, Kosicz, who was the head of the KGB, changed his name. He posed as a writer. The Sand Fiddle was the last novel my father wrote. What about Vera? I met her in Geneva. Kosicz got rid of her and left her in some fancy boarding school. Do you still love her? Yes, but not like you think. What do we do with this? Are you awake? We've reached the border. Subtitle translation by: Rebecca Schofield
