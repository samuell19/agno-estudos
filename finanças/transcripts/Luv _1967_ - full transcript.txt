Harry Berlin! I thought so! Sure enough, it's old Harry Berlin himself. Harry, how you been doing? Why, it must be 15 years. We had that party after graduation. And that was the last time that I saw you. It's 15 years. Is it 15 years? It's 15 years. Hard to believe. As a matter of fact, it's 15 years next month. Time sure flies. Yeah, yeah, yeah, it sure does. Fifteen years next... Fifteen years. Who are you? Milt! Milt Manville! Your old classmate at Poly Arts U. Milt! Milt Manville! Sure, rich old Milt. That's right. Uh-huh. Say, Harry, I've been doing just wonderful for myself. Terrific. I got into the brokerage business. You know, stocks, bonds, securities, you know. Well, the money is just pouring in. I'm doing fabulous. And at night, I have a little sideline, secondhand bric-a-brac and personal accessories, on my own. Great racket. Easy dollar. And, hey, Harry, got myself married. Oh, yeah, I went and did it. I finally did it. Ellen. Wonderful, wonderful girl. Hey, Harry, look at this watch. Solid gold. Twenty-two carats. Hey, Harry, silk underwear. It's imported. Isn't that something? Harry... Smell that. Go ahead, smell it. Smell it. Not bad, huh? French cologne. So what's been happening for you? Go ahead. Let me hear about it. Say, I got a great idea. Where were you headed? No place special, right? Well, I'll tell you what, I'm taking you home to dinner. No arguments. I insist. El, he used to be my best friend. You don't have to knock yourself out with anything fancy. He's a marvelous human being. Wait until you meet him. You're going to love him, I know it. We'll be there in 20 minutes, yeah. Yeah, yeah... Harry! What are you doing? Will you let me get it over with, Milt, huh? Harry, stop talking that way. Please? Harry, stop it. Will you take your hands off me, Milt? Get a hold of yourself. Will you let me go, Milt, please? Just get a hold of yourself. Will you let me end it all, Milt? Harry, Harry, please. It doesn't make any sense. Just relax, Harry. Everything is going to be all right. It's gonna be all right. You should have let me jump off the bridge, Milt. Come here, Harry. Come here. You have to get ahold of yourself. You have to settle down. Listen to me. What you need is a good, stiff drink. What will it be, Harry? Two-thirds water, one-third milk. Did you get that? And I'll have a martini, very dry. All right, Harry, here. Come on in the back. We'll sit, we'll talk. You'll feel better, believe me. That's right. All right. Get straightened out. Now, tell me, Harry. What's come over you? End of the line, Milt. Everything's just falling apart. What things? What? The world. People. Life. Death. The old question. I'm choked with them. I wasn't out of school two weeks when it happened. Out of the blue it hit me. Excuse me, Harry. Excuse me. I left my wallet at home. On a Sunday... Could you lend me five dollars? Sunday afternoon, hot! Lazy, Sunday afternoon. I was sitting in the park, just thinking of the future. Daydreaming. Suddenly I looked up, and there in front of me was... How am I going to put it in words, Milt? It was a dog. A fox terrier. I swear it was a fox. I think it was a fox terrier. You can't tell with those little dogs. They're all mixed up. Let's just say it was a dog. A dog. It was a dog. Right, and it was there in front of me. Just sitting on its hind legs. The thing of it was, Milt, he was laughing. As loud and as clear as I'm talking to you right now. He was laughing. I couldn't believe what was... Then he got up and he came up to me. When he got up to me, Milt, he raised his leg and... No... All over my gabardine pants. And then he just turned around and walked away. All so unreal. Senseless. Why me? Out of all of the people in the... Hundreds and thousands of people. Why me? Can you give me a reason? Huh? That started it. From that time on, everything changed for me. I became aware. Oh, I became aware of the whole rotten, senseless, stinking deal. Nothing mattered to me after that. Nothing. Nothing? Harry, your plans to go to medical school? I couldn't. The book you were writing? No use. Harry, your Greek studies? I couldn't. I couldn't go on. I tried to find some answers. Oh, I went everywhere. Studied with a Brahmin in Calcutta, a Buddhist in Tibet, a Rabbi in Los Angeles, nothing. Absolutely nothing. I didn't know what to do with myself. Where to turn... I started drinking, gambling, started living in whorehouses, smoking marijuana. Oh... Took guitar lessons. Nothing. Still nothing. So today, Milt, I was going to end it all. One last stupid gesture of disgust. That's terrible. Harry, at this moment, I'm ashamed. I'm ashamed to have been your classmate at Poly Arts U. At school everything was so different. I expected so much from myself, the world, the sun, the stars. You remember what they used to call me? Dostoyevsky. That's it. Dostoyevsky. What ambition I had. What energy. Now, ask me what I believe in, Milt. What do you believe in, Harry? I believe in nothing, Milt. Nothing? Nothing. But how can a man go on living if he doesn't believe in anything? That's exactly the problem I've got to face. How could you have changed so much? At school you were so full of life. You were so full of energy. Harry, do you remember? Remember how we used to march down the field together in our red and gold uniforms? You leading the Poly Arts All-Girl Band on the right. And me leading them on the left, and our batons twirling in the air. Don't you remember, Harry, huh? Huh? I remember. I remember. Hey, hey, hey! That a boy, Harry. That a boy. That a boy. Ah... Um... Hey, hey, hey! Hey, hey, hey! You won't be sorry you came, Harry. She's a wonderful girl. And a wonderful cook. Wait until she sees you. Is she going to be thrilled! Yeah. There it is, Harry. This is it. This is the reward for diligence, self-confidence and perseverance. Twenty-five thousand, not including the trees. Nothing succeeds like success. Come on, Harry. The place is yours. That's a dog! That's a dog, Milt! Get rid of the dog, Milt! Milt! The dog... He's just trying to say "hello," Harry. No, he's a dog, Milt! He's only a puppy, Harry. Milt, please, be a friend. He's only a puppy. Harry, Harry, Harry... He likes you. He hates me. Milt, please! Please? I'll chain him up. I'll chain him up. Chain him up. Right, right. Come on, pup. Come on. Come on. That's a boy. That's a boy. All right, Harry. He really likes you, Harry. I can tell. Ellen, we're here. Come on, Harry. Come on in, Harry. It's all right now. All right, Harry. It's all right. Come on. Nice dog. Come on, fella. Yeah, he really likes you, Harry. Ellen? Ellen? Ellen? Now, Ellen, you agreed that you were going to cook dinner for my friend. Now what's fair is fair. What's that? What does it look like, Milt? A chart. You are absolutely right, Milt. It is a chart. I've been working on it since yesterday. Let me explain it to you. These black vertical lines divide our five years of marriage into months. These blue vertical lines divide those months into weeks. Now, every time this red horizontal line hits a blue vertical line that indicates the number of sexual experiences over a seven-day period. El... El, for Pete's sakes, we can talk about this later. We can talk about it now, Milt. Your attention, please. You will notice that at the beginning of our marriage, the red horizontal line hits the blue vertical line at the rate of some fifteen to sixteen times a week. But as the marriage progresses, this becomes less and less and less until a period that starts some 18 months ago. After which, the red horizontal line does not hit the blue vertical line once. Not once, Milt. I have nothing further to say. Milt? Milt! This is it, huh? This is the reward for diligence and self-confidence and perseverance? This is it? Yeah. Then let me get it over with. Harry? Harry, will you cut that out? Harry, will you cut that out? Harry? Harry, let go, let go. Let go of that. Harry, there's plenty of time for that. Milt, be a friend and let me do it, huh? Listen to you, defeated and crushed. That's terrible, just terrible! Harry... Why don't you ask me what I believe in? What do you believe in, Milt? I believe in love. Love? Love. I don't know if I can love. Uh-huh. You don't know? How could I? You don't mean? Not once. Oh, Harry. Harry, to have lived and never to have loved... No wonder you're unhappy. Harry, love changes everything. Love is the most important thing in the world. There's nothing like it. Nothing. Do you know, I'm more in love today than on the day I got married. No kidding. That's right. But my wife, she won't give me a divorce. Come on. I want to show you her picture. Your wife? No. The girl I want to marry. Linda. Come on, Harry. Come on. Close the door. Look, Harry, she's very athletic, she's a gym teacher. She's in great shape. Oh, Harry... Harry, you don't know how much I love this woman. But as long as I'm married, she won't even speak to me. Watch. Watch. Private business phone. So she won't listen in. Hold the phone. Hello? Linda? You see? Why won't your wife give you a divorce? Oh, a divorce. Harry, you see... You don't know about women. All I have to do is ask Ellen for a divorce and she'll die first. You know, Harry, I only got one hope. And that is if Ellen wants a divorce first. You see, if she could only, if she could meet somebody. A man, you know. Harry. Buddy. Old classmate of mine. Uh-uh. Harry, Harry. Pal... No, no. Nothing doing. Definitely not, Milt! Is this what I get for saving your life? Talk about gratitude, Harry. All I'm asking you to do is meet her. Milt, I'm leaving. Okay, okay. Listen, that's your privilege. Huh? Wait, Milt! I can't go on living this way. Loving one woman and living with another. Don't be a fool, Milt! Nothing doing, Harry! Hey, hey! Wait a minute, Milt! That's not like you, Milt. You were always so level-headed. Harry... Hm? Just meet her. She's an exceptional woman, Harry. She has a photographic memory. And she paints, and she makes charts and she plays the guitar... Classical or flamenco? I don't know. I play flamenco. Whatever she does, she does it very good. And, Harry, she reads, books I never heard of, with hard covers. Just meet her, just stay to dinner. All right, I'll stay to dinner, but that's as far as it goes. Oh, what's come over you? Nothing, dear, nothing. You remember me telling you about Harry? Top man at Poly Arts U. Voted "Most Likely To Succeed." Well, El, you're going to love him. He's just a marvelous human being. And you two have so much in common. You know what the fellows used to call him? Dostoyevsky. What a guy! Plays a terrific guitar. And, El, he's not superficial. Oh, no. Concerned with basic questions. You know, life, death... Things like that. Been everywhere. Calcutta, Tibet, Los Angeles. Mm-hmm. Led an All-Girls' Band... He almost wrote a book. You know, kind of an intellectual adventurer. But a heck of a nice guy to boot. Have to darken those a little. Does wonders for your eyes. Gives them that deep, almost oriental look. There we are. Oh, that's much better. Much better. Yeah, put this on. For dinner? You're wasting your time, Milt. Women aren't interested in me. That's not true, Harry. You're educated and you've traveled, and you're handsome, in your own way. Yeah, I don't know. What about my fits? What fits? It can happen any time. Without warning, my whole body becomes paralyzed. I can't move a muscle... Harry! Harry! Harry! What is it? Harry, look at me! Speak to me, Harry. Speak to me! That's the way it happens, Milt. But, Harry, why don't you see a doctor? A specialist... What for? I know what it is. The will to live just drops right out of me, Milt. "Why move?" I say to myself. That's not all. Sometimes I can't see. I lose the power of sight completely. And Milt... Where are you? Milt? Where'd you go, Milt? Huh? Here. Milt, where are you? I'm right here. Harry! Help me a little, Milt. Here, Harry. Harry, I'm here. Milt! I got you. I got you. All right. Just watch it. Watch it. Okay, here. Now sit. Sit, sit down. Down. That's right. Thank you, Milt. I'm okay now. Oh, Harry, that's awful. "Why see?" I say to myself. Why be a witness to it? Why, Milt, why? I don't know, Harry. I don't know. What did you say, Milt? I said, "I don't know." I can't hear you, Milt. Will you speak slowly? I'll try to read your lips. There must be something you can... I can hear you now. Another one of my fits. Sound becomes so painful to me, Milt. So, "Why listen?" I say to myself, why? What was that, Harry? What? Harry, there's nothing coming out. Oh, no. That too? It's beautiful. Harry Berlin. Ellen Manville. My best classmate, and my best wife. How do you do? Harry says, "How do you do?" Yes, well, how do you do? Uh, say, El, what was that book you were reading last night? The one with the hardcovers. I don't remember. Excuse me. How much? Eighty-five cents. Do you hear that? He wants 85 cents for it. - Ha! - All right, 75. Sixty. Seventy. Sixty-five. Sold. Say, El, I was just telling Harry how great you play the guitar. I don't play it great, Milt. I'm only a very, very talented amateur. Excuse me. It's not true. She's really very good at it. How much you want for it? Uh, I think we can talk about that downstairs. Classical or flamenco? Pardon? Classical or flamenco? Um, flamenco. Me, too. Very nice, very nice. This is all French brocade. French, huh? French. Seven bucks. Not a chance. Very nice. Very nice. Thank you. Harry, Harry. Uh, excuse me for one moment. Could you loan me a dollar? I want to make change. No, Milt. Not tonight. Hun, I've got to. Milt, not tonight. Please. El, there's gold in the garbage cans of the city. Milt, we have got to talk. Talk to Harry. Very nice. Very nice, yes. Where's Milt? Milt! What about my six bucks? She's a wonderful girl, isn't she, Harry? Sure. Milt! Try and understand her, Harry. She's had a very hard time. Yeah, Milt! Hey! For crying out loud, Milt! How am I going to get home, Milt? Mm-hmm-mm-hmm. The stars. Yes. Mm-hmm. Star light, star bright. First star I see tonight. I wish I were. I wish I might. Uh... You make a wish. Ha! I wish... I wish I were a lesbian. You don't mean that. Oh, I certainly do. Then I wouldn't have all these demeaning problems. You'd have other problems. Like what? Picking up girls, for one thing. Oh, no. Be very easy. I'd just have to learn how to be a liar and a hypocrite. There's more to it than that. You know what you have to pay for a haircut these days? Oh-ho-ho-ho. Where's the nearest subway? I know. Milt told me everything. Well, it'll work. It'll work out. Sometimes it happens that way. I can't stand it anymore. Wait a minute. Hey, where are you going? Over a cliff. Into a tree. What does it matter? Well, drop me off at the subway. What do you think made me the way I am? You don't have to answer that. When I look back, I realize that it couldn't have worked out very differently. My childhood was impossible. Mm-hmm. Absolutely impossible. It was tortured, it was lonely. Have you ever lived with an alcoholic? My grandparents drank. Oh, yes? Enough to have delirium tremens? My grandmother shook a little. Well, it's not the same thing. Oh, no. It is not the same thing. You... My parents were divorced when I was four years old. I spent six months with one, six months with the other. They passed me back and forth like an old sack. Ellen, please. Will you watch what... I've been passed, you've been passed. I was passed when I was five years old. I was passed from my parents to my grandparents. My grandparents forgot to pass me back. I felt so guilty about the divorce. I thought I'd caused it. I didn't know, I... My parents... Ah! Hi. What a tasteless thing to do! Harry. Ah! Harry, are you all right? Harry. Oh, why me? Of all the noses in the world, why... Oh, I'm so sorry. I'm dying. Harry... I'm dying. You're not dying, Harry. I'm dying. I hear heavenly music. I'm dying. Harry, you're not dying. That's an amusement park. An amusement... I'm dying and I've never even been to an amusement park. I've always been lonely, Harry. You see, on the one hand I possess a cold, calculating mind. Mm-hmm. Sharp as a razor. Incisive. Penetrating. And men are afraid of that. Yeah. It's a threat to their feelings of masculine superiority. Yeah, yeah. My power of analysis, my photographic memory. They resent all that. Yeah, well, some men are like that. Ask me a question, Harry. Ask me a question. Um, how many states did Al Smith win in the election of 1928? In 1928 the presidential candidate Alfred E. Smith won eight states. Arkansas, Alabama, Georgia, Louisiana, Massachusetts, Mississippi, Rhode Island and South Carolina. You're right. I resent that. You see. Now there's so little for me to believe in. So little to keep me going. Yeah, yeah. What about love? Love? Love. I don't know. Once, maybe. Once is more than most people get, I'll tell you. Oh, you know nothing about women, Harry. For a woman to have never known love is not tragic. Because the dream is still there. But when love becomes a shabby, cynical emotion... That's what destroys her. Because the dream is gone. And she becomes an animal, Harry. She becomes a vicious, little creature who doesn't deserve to live! Look, Harry! Look! Put it away! I know he's lying to me, Harry. I know he's seeing another woman, Harry. Get it away. I won't stand for it! I won't let him, Harry! Look, will you put that thing away! Oh! What's left for me, Harry? I don't know. I don't make friends easily. I can't start again. Don't you see, Harry? There's only one thing for me to do. Yes, oh, yes, yes! Ah! Please, let me do it, Harry! Please let me. It's better this way, Harry. Ellen! I can't swim, Ellen! Let me do it! Ellen, please. A smart girl like you! For cryin' out loud! Ellen, don't! Goodbye, everybody! Goodbye, everybody! Please! Oh, God! Here we go again! I've been a great deal of trouble to you. Forget it. I don't often meet people who are so kind. Forget it! I just feel like I have to... Oh, forget it, please! I said forget it! What is the matter with you? You're giving me a headache. I'm getting sick. Why, have a little pity for the nice guy, huh? Please. You've never been in love, have you, Harry? Love? Yes, yes. Love, Harry. Love. It's there, in all of us. Before you said that you... It's hard to kill a dream, Harry. I'm trying to explain, Ellen. Will you please listen? What's the use? The jig is up. The chips are... That's right, Harry. Let yourself go. Hey, this is fun! I'm having fun! Sing, Harry, sing! Yes, sing! Ellen, I think I've fallen for you. Oh, but Harry! Can it possibly be? Look, I've never felt this way before. My heart is beating like a banging door. It's such fun being with someone like you. Dostoyevsky! Ellen Manville! I didn't think it could happen to me, again. I feel weak all over. Harry, do you still think there's nothing? No, no. Life is a mystery! Oh, Harry. Harry, do you hear the birds singing? Yes, yes. Here, birdies! Here, birdies. Oh, Harry, Harry. Oh, Harry, harry. Do you see the moon, Harry? Beautiful, beautiful moon. It's our moon, Harry. Say it, Harry. Yes! Say what? You know. Wait, you mean? Say it. It's not easy. Say it, Harry! I love you, Ellen! Oh, Harry! Oh, Harry! Linda! Linda! Linda, listen to me! She wants a divorce! She's giving me a divorce! Linda, she's giving me a divorce! Milt! Linda, my love! Oh, Milt! Milt! Linda! Milt! Milt! Oh, Linda! Linda! Milt! Milt! Linda! Linda! Linda! Milt! Milt! Oh, Linda! Linda! Milt! Milt! Oh, Linda. Now I want to stress that the division of all property and possessions will be completely fair and equitable. I hate squabbling. And besides, you're both adult, mature people. So is Milt. Now, first the matter of the, of the dog. Who gets the dog? Milt does. I couldn't bear to be separated from my dog, Harry. Yes, well, Mrs. Manville gets the dog. Now, a-about the house... Well, in that regard, I think that we... Mrs. Manville gets the house. You see the wife always gets the house. And of course, you'll continue with the mortgage payments. Look, El. Now, I've never told you this before, but I couldn't start school until I was eight years old because I didn't have a pair of shoes to wear. Now lucky for me, the kid downstairs got hit by an ice-cream truck and I got his shoes. But even then, they were too tight for my feet. I couldn't walk. I was put into a special class for disabled children. You think that was bad? Oh. Whenever it snowed, my grandparents locked me out of the house. A skinny kid with a torn jacket, a paper bag for a hat. Knocking and yelling, "Let me in! Please, let me in!" Paradise. What did they used to feed you for breakfast? A glass filled with two-thirds water and one-third milk. Coffee grounds. That's what I got. With sugar? Not on your life. I ate it straight, like oatmeal. Your old man ever beat you? He did. With what? A strap. A chain. You were both lucky and you didn't know it. Lucky? Did anybody ever call you a bastard? A relative or a stranger? Relative. I never even had a birthday party. I never knew when my birthday was until I got a notice from my draft board. What kind of presents did they used to give you for Christmas? Presents. When I was five years old my grandparents bought a dozen donuts. Every Christmas until I was 17 and I got a donut. Did anyone ever try to rape you? Um... When I was 15 years old, two boys grabbed me. If I hadn't kicked and screamed... Now, please! Please! We've got a lot of property here to divide up. What about all that junk in the cellar? It's Milt's. Milt accumulated that with his own two hands. Thanks, El. No, fair is fair. I don't want anything I'm not entitled to, Milt. Linda, my love. Linda, I'm coming! Harry. Harry, am I the first woman you ever loved? The very first. But Harry... But, Harry, you have slept with other women, haven't you? How many, Harry? I'd like to know. Ellen! I don't remember. An approximate figure will do. Twenty-eight. Twenty-eight. Twenty-eight different women or one woman 28 times? Six women once, and one woman 22 times. Oh... Thank you, Harry. Thank you for being honest. Ellen. What about you? Harry, I don't know exactly what you mean. No, you know. I told you. Now it's your turn and, you know. This contains the whole story. But Harry, remember that he was my husband. It had nothing to do with personal likes or dislikes. I'll read it later. Ellen. Ellen. Hey. Ellen. Harry. Ellen. Ellen! Ellen. Ellen! Ellen! You do love me, don't you? Oh, Harry, you know I do. How much? Tell me how much. That's very hard, Harry. I mean, love is really not a commodity that you can measure by degree. How much do you love me? A lot. An awful lot. But how much? I see what you mean. You see then... You see the problem. You see. That's a problem. Ow! Ooh! What did you do that for? Do you still love me? Yes. Yes, I do. That proves it. If you can love me after I did that to... Harry, has your love for me changed? Harry? Harry, has it? Harry? Harry? All right, it's all right. Oh, Harry. Harry. Harry, now I know I didn't make a mistake. Oh, Harry. Harry, I'm going to be a good wife to you, Harry. Harry, I have no qualms about getting a job. I've no qualms about going to work. Anything, until you get on your feet. Harry, I learned a great deal being married to Milt and this time... Well? I love you, Harry. As much as before? Yes, Harry, as much as before. I love you, Harry. Harry Berlin is happy. For the first time in 15 years. Harry Berlin is happy! He's happy! Ellen, I'm not going to disappoint you. I'm going to make good. I know I will. Harry Berlin is going to pull himself together. Has your love for me decreased in any way, Harry? Has it? It's cold. Answer my question, Harry. No. Ellen, I love you. Everything is clearing up for me. I... I have a feeling I could start to write poetry again. I wrote tons of it in school. "Under a star-lit window. "Two lovers lay in bed. "Naked up to their shoulders. "For neither had a head." Oh, Harry! Harry! Harry! Ellen! Harry! Do you love me? I love you. Turn around. Do what I told you. Harry, I love you, Harry. Harry? No, my coat. My coat! Oh, no! Oh, my coat! Oh, my coat! Oh, my coat! Do you still love me? Oh, no. I bought it with my own money. Answer me, yes or no. Do you still love me or don't you? I love you, Harry. I love you. Oh, Ellen. I love you. I love you. I love you, Harry. Ellen! I love you! I love you, Harry, I love you. I never thought I'd get married at City Hall. What's the difference, dear? It's only a legality. Legality? It's the most important day in a woman's life. Well, for a man too, dear. But we mustn't be extravagant. You know. Darling, I've tried to explain. I've put every cent I had into fixing up the new apartment. Now just wait until you see it. Now Linda... Linda. Our own home. I've been counting the minutes. Harry. Harry? Harry? Harry? Harry? Harry! Harry! Harry! Harry! Harry! Harry! Harry? Harry? Harry. Oh, Linda, Linda. Get the dog. Ellen, out with the dog, please. Come down from there, Harry. He loves you. He hates me. Come. Come on. Come. Out. Fine. All clear? All clear. Where's my paper hat? I don't know. Well, I need it. Harry, I'm late for work. I want my paper hat. Here. What are you reading? Help wanted... Male. Mm-hmm. Listen, Harry, there are some very tempting jobs listed here. Listen to this one. "Night watchman. Ammunition dump. Pension plan. Paid vacation." You gotta have experience. Here's one that says, "No experience necessary." Look, Harry. "Tracey's Department Store. Immediate openings. Absolutely anyone accepted." Oh sure, "Anyone accepted." Anyone accepted, unless he happens to have a bum leg. There's nothing wrong with your leg, Harry. Oh, no? Then why doesn't it... You're right. That's moving. I can walk again! Harry Berlin can walk again! Hmm. Then you'll go to Tracey's Department Store? El, I just made a big decision. This fall, I'm applying for medical school. Medical school? I know how you feel. I understand. Night calls, blood all over my clothes. It's not going to be easy. But that will be my laboratory. Yes. Yeah, working... Working without sleep. Filling that place with smelly chemicals. Just trial and error until at last the Harry Berlin vaccine is perfected. It'll be worth it. All the frustrations and heartache, the disappointment. I'm going to work, Harry. Ellen! One thing I ask. Tie up that dog. Gotta sterilize this place. Paint it up. Linda, get up, you lazy slob! Linda, rise and shine, Linda! Try getting up, Linda, we all do it. Come on. Come on. Come on. Up! Up! That's it, that's it! That's it. You can do it. You can do it. That's it. That's it. What a good girl. Oh, Milt. What a good girl, yes. There you are. Now, Linda. Linda, can you hear me? I'm tired. From what? From all those years of calisthenics. Do you know how many knee bends I've done? But you've had six weeks solid rest. I'll bet I've done three million knee bends. We need money. We have money problems. My settlement with Ellen has left me stone broke. Tomorrow there's another mortgage payment on the house. Ninety-three dollars. Where am I going to get $93? I don't know, Milt. We have a client who wants a chaise lounge. How much? Eight. Eight. I need 30. Ten. Fifteen. Twelve. Sold. Take it when she's having her nap. Manville, we'd better go over these accounts together. Uh, yes, sir. It should only take a few hours. Sit down. Sit down. Linda. Linda. You're dressed! I'm leaving, before you sell everything. What? What have I sold? I may be dumb, Milt, but I'm not that dumb! I know there was a chaise lounge there! Mr. Manville, I want to assure you now that the division of all property and possessions will be completely fair and equitable. El? Milt. Milt Manville. What a small world! El, how are you? I'm fine. I'm just fine. How are you? Just fine. Fine. Oh, fine. Fine. How is, uh, Linda? How's Linda? Couldn't be better. Oh, fine. And Harry? He's... He's happy, Milt. He's happy. Well I, uh, I guess things worked out just perfectly for both of us, didn't it, huh? I mean, do I thank you or what do I... Milt, do you find that you laugh more? That's it. That's it, El. El, you hit it. Is it it? Laugh. Linda and I, we get up in the morning and we just start laughing. It's crazy, right? She laughs and... For no reason. This is crazy, everything. I don't know what... El... El, I can't lie to you, um... Linda left me. She, uh... Linda's walked out on me. Oh... Oh, I'm awfully sorry. If you went after her, reasoned with her. Who wants her? That slob! Milt! El, she's a witch. I mean it. I mean it. Hm. Surely not. She changed overnight. She was a different person. I mean physically, too. She started to grow a mustache. Well, that's not an uncommon affliction in some women. Perhaps if you had given her sympathy. I should have given her shaving cream. Milt. El, she quit her job and she'd lay around in bed and eat bonbons all day. Did she keep the apartment clean? Keep it clean? Hit me. Go ahead, hit me. Right there. Now! I mean, am I exaggerating? That's despicable! I mean that is absolutely despicable! Just despicable. Well, she is, she's despicable. Just despicable. Was there ever a speck of dust in our house? No El, no. Did I lie in bed all day and eat bonbons? No. No, El. Why didn't I, Milt? Ask me why. Why, El? Because I was a jerk, that's why. No, El. No, sir. Oh, yes. You were never a jerk, El. No, sir. Oh, yes, I was a jerk. No. Oh, yes. I feel this is inappropriate, I really don't want to hear it. Don't want to hear, Milt. I'm not going to listen. I'm not going to listen, Milt. Not listening. Not listening. Okay, okay. Oh, oh, oh, El, El, El. Okay. Listen. Just tell me you love Harry Berlin and I promise, I promise you'll never see me again. Love Harry Berlin? Just say those words, and it's goodbye to Milt Manville and his silly, stupid, but sometimes lovable ways. You talk about misery. You don't know what misery is. He... Who is he? What is he? He's not human, Milt. He lies in a corner all day. No. Yes. With a paper bag on his head. Well, then, El... Why? But why, El? Ask me what I believe in, Milt. What do you believe in, El? I believe in marriage, Milt. That's something you could never understand. I believe in a man coming home at 5:00 shouting, "What's for dinner, hon?" I believe in being a good wife and mother. But where is the man to whom I can be a good wife, Milt? Where are the children who cry out for my arms and the milk in my breasts? Here. Here I am. No, Milt. No. It's too late. El... El, what if I were to tell you that I'm willing to give up my second-hand bric-a-brac business? You mean... I mean, I'm willing to stop scrounging in garbage cans. But Milt, it means so much to you. What's for dinner, hon? Steak, puree of turnips, and mashed lima beans. Everything you like. Harry Berlin has fixed the left clavicle. Wonderful, Harry. Very nice. Look. Look. Mm-hmm. Oh, yes, very nice, Harry. Quite nice. Um, Harry, I, uh... I want to talk to you. Please sit down. What would I do without you? How would I live without you? Hug me, hold me, my sweet precious. I love you so much. Harry, not now. Harry. Harry. I need you. Sit up. Sit up properly. What is it, my sweet? Stop it, Harry, please. My darling. Harry, please, stop it and pay attention. Please. This is important. Harry, I have tried. I have tried to be a good wife to you. Bur despite all my efforts, our marriage is a failure. Our marriage, a failure? Yes, Harry. A failure. I don't know what to say, Ellen. This comes as a complete shock. Up until this very moment, I thought we were a happily married couple. You thought... I had no idea. How could you think that? What? Didn't you hear me walking the floor nights? Didn't you hear me crying in the bathroom? No. What did you think I was doing in the bathroom all night? I didn't want to think about it. I used to wake up in the middle of the night. I'd say to myself, "What is she doing in the bathroom so long?" But I didn't want to change you. Ellen, I wanted you to stay just as you were. Is that a crime? Harry, our marriage is a failure. It has been a failure since the first day. I don't have one memory worth keeping. Oh, no. Oh, no. Ellen, we had lots of good times together. Remember? Remember what? Where's my paper hat? I don't have your... Well, somebody's got my paper hat. It's not on my head, is it? Harry, I want a divorce. Oh... I don't believe it. I do not believe it's happening. Not to us, not to Harry and Ellen Berlin. What did I do wrong? What did I do wrong? Explain it. Give me a reason. I can give you a dozen reasons. Here's one. These black vertical lines divide our six weeks of marriage into days. Now, wherever the red horizontal line hits a black vertical line, that indicates one sexual experience over a 24-hour period. Where's the red horizontal line? There is none. Now do you understand? Why didn't you tell me? Hm? I've never been married before. You have. You should have told me. A lot of good that would have done. Why do you say that? Because no normal man could have behaved the way you have behaved these past six weeks. And I'd rather not say any more. No, no, no. Go ahead. It will be painful. Go ahead. Say it. All right. All right. You don't love me, Harry. You are incapable of that kind of love. You loved, all this time, you really loved Milt. What? That's right. Milt Manville. And you married me as a substitute figure because you could not confront him and your own latent homosexuality. What are you saying, Ellen? I'm saying you're queer, Harry. It can't be. I'm-I'm sorry. I'm really sor... You asked for it. I love Milt Manville? That's right, Harry. I'm afraid that you do. I don't even like the guy. Don't you, Harry? Don't you really? The way he has of laughing? The way his eyes sparkle when he gets excited, hm? No. No, no. Oh, no. No. I love you! I love you. I'm going to prove it to you! I'll show you. I'll make you happy. Harry... Oh, my little honey-bunny. I'll make you happy. Put me down. We'll both be happy... Stop it. Harry, stop it. Harry. Harry, will you put me down. Harry? I'll show you. Harry! I'll make you happy. My ducky-wucky! My mashy-mashy! Harry... I'll give it to you! Happy! Happy-happy-happy. Stop it, Harry. Stop it. Harry. Harry. Stop it! Stop it! Stop it! What's wrong? I'm trying to do what you told me to. For crying out loud! Is there no satisfying a woman? Are you expecting someone? Yes, I am. The man I love. Hello, Harry. You love Milt Manville? Yes, Harry. Get out of my house! Your house? I just made the mortgage payment. Get out! Milt, get out! Harry. Harry, listen. Now look, I understand that this is painful. After all, we've known one another. Don't try anything funny. Just get out of my house. Ellen, get him out. I don't believe it. Fifteen years, my best friend. Milt, how could you do this to me? Harry, listen. Get a grip on yourself. What did you... I can't hear what you're saying, Milt. I'm not going to read your lips. Just get out. Get him out, get him out of the house, Ellen. Harry. Wherever he is, get him out of the house. No, he didn't agree. Where are you? Harry. Harry. You're still here, Milt. Get out! Harry. We love each other. Please try to see it from our point of view. We're human beings too. Harry! You'd better go, Milt. He took it very hard. Yes, he took it very hard. Ellen, where are you going? I am going to say goodbye to Milt. And if you behave yourself, I'll be back in a minute. A minute. A thousand and one! Thousand and two! Thousand and three... It's no use, Milt. He'll never give me a divorce. But he's got to. But he won't. You saw that he won't. There's got to be a way. If he could only meet somebody. A woman... Something, you know. How would he meet someone? He never leaves the house. He wouldn't meet them. He sits with that paper bag on his head. Linda. Linda? Linda. If he could meet Linda, she's still pretty, El. She's not as pretty as you. But she's left you. But I could arrange something. It's not going to be hard. If I could just get Linda to speak to me and if you can just get Harry out of the house. We can have a meeting. The four of us in a restaurant. If you can afford it? Right? Certainly. Anything. Oh, yes. I love you. I love you. I love you, Milt. I love you. I love you... Ellen! It's a minute! Tomorrow night. Tomorrow night. I'll make all the arrangements. I'll make the arrangements. - El. El. - Ellen! Pants. Pants. Milt. Harry likes Japanese food. Japanese. Japanese. I love you. I love you. I love you. I love you. It's a minute, seven. Ellen! Ellen. Harry. I've got something to tell you. I've just made a big decision. I'm doing this just for you. Just to please you. I love you. I believe in love. And love means sacrifice. Hm? So, I'm going to take one of those immediate openings at Tracey's Department Store. Just relax, lady, everything's just fine. Oh, here he comes now. Just a second, folks. All right, stand back, folks. Stand back, please. You're too high! Calm down, ladies. You're too low! Oh... Keep calm, ladies. Just a minute, please. Uh, hold it there, hold it. Hold it, that's close enough. Watch your step, ladies. Watch your step. Watch your step, please. Step up, please. Where can I find the shower curtains? The third floor. Fifth? You'll try the eighth. Off we get. We'll get to the rear. Beachwear. Women's beachwear? Women's beachwear? Women's beachwear? Which floor, please? Which floor is women's beachwear on? Just speak slowly? I'll try to read the lips. I said, "Which floor is woman's beachwear?" The car is full. Watch the doors. Nobody panic! Nobody panic! Don't forget our movie date tonight. I'll see you at 7:00. Stop! Come back! Hold on, lady! Oh, my. There's a customer on your roof! Whiskey sour? Huh? Oh, yes. Yes, uh, that... That's here. Bourbon Old Fashioned? Mine here. No, there. Vodka gimlet? There. Two-thirds sake and one-third milk? Yes, that's... That's fine. They never should have put me in that elevator. Ellen? Where are you, Ellen? Ellen? Let me take your hand, Harry. Over here. I tell you, my ears are still ringing. Your shoes, please. My what? Your shoes. You gotta take your shoes off. My shoes... Why do I take my shoes off? Well, it's a Japanese restaurant and that's how they do things here. They took my cane. They'll give it back to you. Why did they take my cane? What are they doing to me now? They're putting on a Hopi coat for you. A Hopi coat? Hopi-Hopi? There we go. Where's my cane. Give him his cane back. I tell you, man wasn't made to travel vertically. So sorry. He's in the wrong booth. Elevators are against the law of gravity. I'll tell you something else. We'll never make it to the moon. All day long, up, down... Ellen? Where am I? Here I am, Harry. Walk straight ahead. Now turn right. Sharp right. Turn again. This way. Give me the cane, Harry. Right, now, Harry... Harry, cross your feet and bend your knees. I can't, I'm paralyzed. Harry, you have to sit down, see. Why me? Because it's a Japanese restaurant. Don't you like Japanese food? My stomach hurts. Harry, bend your knees. Hello, Harry. What is he doing here? Harry, I told you Milt was going to be here. Ha-ha. No, you didn't. Harry, do not make a scene. I did tell you that Milt was going to be here. Harry, we've already ordered your drink. He has had such a trying day. Well, then a drink is going to do him good. Where is my six bucks? We're going to settle up in a minute, Harry. In the meantime, drink up. Come on. Sure. Have a drink, Harry. Have a little bit of a drink. To Linda. Oh, to Linda. Yeah, to Linda... To Linda. Who's Linda? Oh, she's a wonderful, wonderful girl. Isn't she, El? She's a wonderful girl. She is a wonderful girl. To Linda. To Linda. To Linda. To Linda. To Linda. Harry, you've got a real treat in store for you, believe me. I've had Sukiyaki before. No, not Sukiyaki, Linda. Just wait until you meet her. I don't want to meet her. Oh, sure you do. I mean, if ever two people had a lot in common, it's you two. Oh, no. Now, wait a minute. I'm a happily married man, Milt. Harry, I'm only asking you to meet her. Come on, be a sport. Will you cut that out? I'm looking for a friend. Linda, glad you could make it. You look great, just as neat as a pin. Why am I here, Milt? Oh, just a friendly meal. You're hurting me. Terribly sorry, Harry. El... Uh, Ellen, uh, this is Linda. Mrs. Berlin? How do you do, Mrs. Manville? Yes. Uh, fine. That's just fine. And now we're going to sit down. And then we're going to get you your drink, and then we're going to meet Harry. That's right. Here we are, sure. Uh, Harry? Harry, this is Linda. I'm not interested, Milt. Isn't he something, huh? He's a tease. Come on, Harry, just say, "Hello." Hello. Hello. Oh, it's you! Linda! Linda. Check please. Linda, wait. Just get to know him. Know him? I hate him! Hate is the closest thing to love. Linda, please be reasonable. Just have a quiet dinner with him. Let me go! Shoes... Shoes, where are they? That's a hint. That's all. That's it. Harry, you'd better give her a divorce. I told you... That's it. Harry, we're not made of stone. You're putting on my shoe, Milt. We got feelings too. And if we can't do it legal, then we'll find other ways. What other ways? Ways, ways, I find ways. You're making a scene, Milt. I'm not making a scene. I have a right. I love you. And I'm taking you home. You haven't got a home. I did have until you came along! Come on. Ellen, I forbid it! I forbid it! Your check, sir. My check? You pay breakage. You pay dry cleaning. He pays! He owes me six bucks! Let's go. Thank you. Ellen! Ellen, come back! Let's rock. Who says I don't have a house? Milt, it's no use. It's no use. I have a house. He'll never give me a divorce. Yeah, well, I'll have him sent away. That would take years. And money. Money, yeah. Well, then I'll think of another way. Milt! Milt, he's following us. Oh, he's gonna get killed! There's another way. El. Hello? Where are you? All you had to do was one simple lousy thing. You said you'd have him down here at 10:00. I know, but you see, I forgot what was on television tonight. The scalpel. Give him the scalpel! Will you... Okay. Maybe tomorrow night. No. It's tonight or never. Now El, just stay calm. Keep your head. And meet me on the bridge after he goes to sleep. I'll get him down here somehow. Trust me. They'll lose him. Milt, why can't I know how you're getting him down here? Trust me, will you? Just trust me. Why can't I know how you're getting him here? What's... El, you're not trusting me. I asked you to trust me. Now do that. I do trust you. But I love you. I want to share in whatever guilt there is. Will you shut up and trust me? I love you, too. Now talk about something else. Milt, Milt... Look, there's a horse and wagon up on the pedestrian way. So what? But isn't that funny, a horse and wagon on the pedestrian way? No, it's not funny. It's perfectly normal. They're not allowed on the expressway. Why are you so irritable with me? I'm not irritable. I just know why everything has to be a discussion. Milt, they dropped something off the cart. Let me out! Please! Let me out of here! It's Harry! Harry was in the cart! Is that how you got him down here? Trust me, El! What was that? Ellen! What happened? Ellen! You saved me! You saved me from the kidnappers! Milt? Milt? Ellen, how will I ever repay you? You risked your life to save mine! Ellen, you love me. Milt! Milt! You love me, I always knew you loved me. Oh, Ellen, the birds, the stars, the moon... our moon. Milt! Milt! Why do you keep saying "Milt"? Milt is down there. Milt! Milt? There he is! They're dragging him into that boat. Hey, Milt! What are you doing down there? He's safe. You crazy nut! Shall I go down there? Ellen. No, I'd better stay here. Ellen... Ellen, will you please stand still? I'm trying to thank you for saving my life. Forget it. Ellen, when the chips were down, your love for me came through. Harry, I don't love you. Yes, you do. No, I don't. I have never loved you. I will never love you. Now that I've lived with you, I find that you are an utterly obnoxious person. All right. That's a beginning. That's a start. You really love me, Harry? Yes, I do. How much? Everything. I... All right, Harry. Prove it. Well, just tell me how. That way, Harry. You don't mean... Yes. Goodbye, Harry. Oh, I can't watch. Yeah. Harry? Harry? Harry? Harry. Okay, Harry. Come on. Snap out of it. Come on! Ellen! Ellen! Okay, come on. Harry, come on. Out of it, Harry. Come on. Come on, Harry. Harry, come on. Harry. Snap out of it... Milt... Oh, Milt. Are you all right? He tried to kill me. You saw it. She was a witness, Harry. I was so worried. I didn't know what to do. I didn't know if you were safe. Why is he standing with his hands out? Oh, I can't... I can't wake him up. Harry. Harry. He won't wake up. Harry. Harry. Harry. Harry. Harry. Come on, Harry. Harry? Come on, Harry. Come on, Harry. Harry? Harry, come on. Snap out of it. Harry? Harry? Harry? Come on. Harry? Harry, come on. Come on, Harry. Harry, snap out of it. Harry. El. Why bother? What? What do you mean? I mean, what are we doing? Just grab his feet. Now? Yeah, grab his feet. El... El, it's the best way. Oh... Soon we'll be together. Oh... Grab his feet? Just grab his feet. Milt, I'm nervous. I don't think I can go through with this. Just look in my eyes, sweetheart, and say, "I love you, Milt Manville." I love you, Milt Manville. And I love you. Now push, dear. I love you, Milt Manville, I love you, Milt Manville. Quickly. I said push. I love you, Milt Manville. Push! Push, dear! Push! I love you, Milt Manville. El, you're pushing me out. El... I love you, Milt Manville. El! I love you, Milt Manville. I love you. Ellen! Milt! Ellen! Help! Darling, are you all right? Yeah, I'm all right. Answer me. I just did, I'm all right. Nothing to worry about. Milt! Hey, Milt, what is the matter with you? And where's my six bucks? Milt! Don't just stand there talking to him, do something! Help! Help! Help. Never mind. Never mind. Hey, help! I love you, Milt Manville. Milt, are you all right? Ellen! I love you, Milt Manville. I love you, Milt Manville. Hey, help! Milt? Are you all right? Help! Help! Ouch. Easy. Easy. Don't tip the board, El. Hey, help! Quick, my dear. Quickly. Ellen? You're kneeling on my wrist. Yes. Pardon me. Hold on! Nobody panic! One, two, three, four... Help! Help! Somebody help! Help is here! Help! Hey, I've done it! Somebody's coming. One, two, three, four... Help! Quick! Help me! They're coming! Help. My wife, my best friend, they're stuck on the scaffold... Quickly. Quickly, dear. Milt Manville is down there on the scaffold with my wife. Milt? Help me. That's better, El. Pull that rope over there. Hard. Pull that rope. Hard. I appreciate this, Harry. You must admit, this is nice of him. Oh, yes. Well, Harry is not a bad person. No. Sorry about pushing you off, Milt. Well, we all make mistakes, El. Something seems to have gone wrong. Harry? Matter of time. Harry, Harry, pull your end. How long's it looking? I'm going to fall, Milt. We're tilting! Yes. I think you gotta keep on pulling! Linda! It's not going to work. Linda, you'd better give me a slack! Oh! Linda! Linda! Oh... I can't swim! Somebody help me! I can't sw... I love you, El. I love you, Milt. I love you much more than you love me. No, Milt, I love you more. This is it. I'm lost in the murky water. Why not, why not? Why... Oh. Don't bother about me. Save the others. I love you. Not as much as I love you, Milt. Oh, more than you love me. You couldn't love more than I love you, Milt. Save the others. I don't want to live. I've got nothing to live for. No love. No hope. Oh, save me! Swim, girl, swim!
