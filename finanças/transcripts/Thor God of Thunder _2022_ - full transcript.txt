[music] How come they feed him better than us? Oh, look who's late with my meal again. Uh, Ivar. Would you be a gentlemen and get me more olives, please? It's my birthday, after all. Give out your hand. All right, I'll bite. - [spits] - [laughs] - I'm going for more wine. - [laughing] [door squeals] So long, Ivar. [grunts] Yes. Ivar? Ivar! [grunts] You will never escape. Odin and Thor will find you. I've already escaped. [neck cracks] [echoing snarls] [distant sounds of screaming] [distant shouting] MAN: Loki has escaped! Search every room! MAN 2: Search the castle! Loki! Stop this madness right now. Midgard will fall. And I will replant this tree. When that happens, you can either join me or you can be against me. But I assure you, it will be too late, for I will have all the power. Only a fool would seek a shattered world. There would be nothing left for you to rule! I will not allow you to fulfill the destiny of Ragnarok. It was not the answer I'd hoped for, but if you get in the way, so be it. Your magic does not work... in my throne room. I don't need magic to defeat your old, decrepit soul. Without your staff, you are nothing! Loki, stop this now. What, are you afraid that once I release the Great Wolf, that he will hunt you down and fulfill his destiny - by destroying you? - There can still be peace. [grunting] I took no pleasure in your sentencing. Yet there I was, rotting away in that dungeon. I spent far too long idly by... mocked and ridiculed by the people, our people, while you've sat there in that throne room, doing nothing for our world. I can finish what I started all those years ago! [grunting] Surrender, Loki. Surrender! Thor is on his way. And you have no escape. Surrender? I am just getting started, Odin. Aah! Thor! [thunder rumbling] Ugh... Odin... I warned you. [thrumming] [electricity sizzling] Father! Father! [thunder crashing] [thunder crashing] Oh! No! Father. Father! Rag... Ragnarok. Father, save your strength. - I'll get help. - No, no. Loki... Loki is going to Midgard... to awaken Fenrir and destroy the tree of the Nine Realms that will then regrow in Loki's control! Fenrir... Fenrir was imprisoned. Never to be set free. The mortals, they don't understand. They don't understand what they... they have released. How do I stop it, Father? You need to find... the other half of the Vargr amulet. If the two halves are put together, they could destroy the Great Wolf. You must follow him. You cannot let him succeed. Where do I find the amulet? It was given to a mortal king many years ago. Even I... do not know where it resides. You need to find Fenrir's tomb! Father... Father? Father! Father! [rumbling] That's a 2.6. What do you think, Grace, 2.6.? Huh? - That earthquake. - What earthquake? Hand me the hilt. Why do you keep looking at that? [sighs] See this? Yeah. Looks like a kite. You think indigenous Native Americans are flying kites? Is this some kind of sporting goods store from 200 years ago? Can you at least pretend you know petroglyphs? Hey, you want a geologist? I'm your guy. You want someone to do a coffee run, still your guy. You want somebody to identify indigenous symbols? - Not your guy. - Clearly. And besides, this isn't indigenous Native Americans. What is it? This is the symbol of Fenrir, the Great Wolf. He was a god, with the power to destroy Odin. Odin? Like Thor. Like that Odin? Yep. And legend has it that Fenrir was so mean and uncontrolled that he tried to start the end of times. If he were to fulfill his prophecy, then he would destroy the Nine Realms and kill Odin and his wife, Frigg. What happened to Fenrir? They captured him and imprisoned him for all eternity. Let's hope he doesn't escape. Grace. Hey, Adrian. Grace here just discovered Valhalla. And the end of the world. That's pretty cool, right? Dr. Sagias wants us to hold off. - Why? - Well, he's worried that we're experiencing foreshock leading up to one big earthquake. No, he-- tell Dr. Sagias you don't know if a foreshock is a foreshock unless it's preceded by a bigger quake, and the main event may not happen for months. Look, let me just call him, I'll talk to him... - No, it's more than that. - What do you mean? It's a cluster of quakes, and they've been happening at the same time and apparently around the whole world. No, you can't have two quakes at once, let alone a cluster of them. But let me get online, and I'll check the USGS, and I'll look at their seismographs, okay? Okay. Adrian, look. - Migration period? - Yeah. Vikings. I can see that. It's easily over a thousand years old. Adrian, this is everything. We can prove that Vikings traveled across North America all the way to California, way before anyone ever thought. It could be a plunder. You know, a souvenir from battle. I mean, Vikings were already in Newfoundland by this time. That's fine. But look closely at these rocks. I see petroglyphs of other symbols, all Norse. - This makes no sense. - Adrian, this is a Viking tomb, and we just have to get inside. There's no record of Vikings making it this far west. I know! This is like when... Cope and Marsh discovered huge dinosaur bones in the United States in the 1800s. No one knew they could make it this far. Sorry. I can't open it until we get the all clear. We're so close. We just have to open this tomb. I'll go inside, I'll see inside for just a moment. I'll get a site survey out here in a week. I can get it certified in less than two weeks. Two weeks makes no difference for a tomb that's been here for a thousand years. I'll get my team here to secure the site so Dr. Sagias is more comfortable. Okay. And then we'll have this turned around in a week. [rumbling] Everyone okay? It opened by itself. Give me the rock saw. I'm going to go get help. I'll talk to Dr. Sagias. Hi. Yes, I need to speak to Dr. Sagias now. It's Adrian at the site. Flashlight? It's 30,000 lumens. [beeping] - What's that beeping? - That's me. Hydrogen levels are really high. Dangerous? Probably happened when the door opened. Yeah, when hydrogen meets oxygen, it's pretty explosive. Yeah-- it also makes water. Yeah. Nick, you won't believe what just happened. Not much in here. Maybe we're not the first to open it. No. Viking tombs were not like Egyptian tombs. Very basic. I'm surprised it has petroglyphs. Must have been someone special. Or something. I don't see a body. Vikings were usually cremated. So this isn't a tomb? I don't know. Could be a shrine. What did the symbols say? - [gasping] - Sorry. Just talked to Dr. Sagias. He doesn't want us in here. Come on. You gotta be kidding me right now. He wants to send a structural engineer out here to make sure it's safe. Okay. Okay. Come on, Grace. Got it. Grace, come on. [beeping] [sighing] Definitely Norse. I see more of the wolf hieroglyphs. Fenrir? Yes, but... I see some Native American symbols, too, like early. Tongva symbols. So, this tomb was a joint venture between indigenous tribes and the Vikings? Taking a guess, but... maybe both groups built this because they both had a vested interest. In building a Viking tomb? Why would the Tongva tribes do that? Respect? Or fear. Look at these symbols. That's a Valknut, symbol of death. That's Yggdrasil, tree of the Nine Realms. That's Tongva for bad spirit, sun. Maybe it's not a tomb. Maybe it's something else. Like what? Anything. A passageway, a room, a shrine. A prison. For the wolf god that wants to eat the sun and destroy the Nine Realms. Stop. Two cultures teaming together to build a prison. Why? [whooshing] Whoa, whoa. I don't think so. - Excuse me, sir. - Do not touch me. This is a secure area. We need to see some I.D. Some I.D.? What is I.D.? Do you not know who I am? Sir, you could be Abraham Lincoln walking in here with John Wilkes Booth. And I'd still need I.D. Clearly must be some friends of yours. You're not in charge, are you? I.D. Enough with the I.D. Who's in charge? That'd be Dr. Nick Sagias, executive director at the Odinkar Museum. That guy. Dr. Sagias. Handsome fellow. May I go in? - I need to call this in. - No, you don't. No, I don't. Afternoon, Dr. Sagias. It's great to see you. Would you like me to get the team and meet you at the site? Won't be necessary. All right. Sounds good. Been in prison far too long, my friend. I know what you're going through. The wait is over. I can't believe I missed that. What? That's thulite. That's why it has that pink tint to it. - Thulite? - Yeah, it's Norwegian. These are huge rocks. What are they doing here? Would they travel across the country with tons of thulite? You can't find thulite in California. Not a thousand years ago. I mean, they found something similar at Searles Lake, but deep. Really deep-- you'd need 19th century engineering - to extract it. - Hey, Dr. Choi. Morning, Harold. Did Sagias say he was coming in today? No, I just spoke to him on the phone. Why? I'm pretty sure he's here. - What? - I think he's in the tomb. [rumbling] Did you authorize the explosives? - Why would I do that? - Harold, call 911. Nick? Hello? Grace, I think the room got bigger. Another door opened! - Nick! - Whoa, whoa, whoa! - It's a lot of hydrogen! - We should wait outside. Listen, my guess is this time there was a volatile chemical reaction. Another door. Who cares? Let's go! We're looking for Nick. No, this is a volatile site that just exploded and possibly killed someone. We need to go. - He could be hurt. - Dr. Choi? First responders are on their way, but they've got questions because it's a dig site. Hello? Patrick, let's go. Patrick! Patrick... [beeping] [coughing] Patrick! - Patrick! - Adrian. Patrick, let's go. Wait, wait, that's Dr. Sagias. Oh my God. Nick? Don't touch me. It's okay, Dr. Sagias. You're at the dig site. There was an explosion. Nick, it's me, Adrian Quinn. Are you... Are you hurt? Are you okay? I don't want your help, okay? They found him. Yeah, he's just a little stunned. All right, everybody, it's not safe here. We got to get everybody out. Sir? Dr. Sagias, I'm going to lead you to the surface, all right? Stay away from me. All of you! Nick. It's me, Grace. I do not require your assistance at this time. Why are you here, Nick? I came... to visit the prison of Fenrir myself. How did you know this was the prison of Fenrir? We need to go outside. This room is too unstable. We need to leave. That's fine. I'll go with Patrick here. You all leave. Okay. - You got him? - I'm fine, fine, just-- yeah. Uh-uh. Did Nick seem off to you? No one said anything about him showing up to the site. He's like that. Yeah, but you just talked to him. I talked to him on the phone. He could have been on his way to the site. Right. Look, Nick is eccentric. Could have been stunned from the blast. Did you notice he's not limping? He always has a cane. I mean, we should have heard him or at least seen him. How'd he sneak past us? I'm gonna make a few calls. I'm not sure what's going on, - but it doesn't feel right. - I'm going to go back. What? I was just wondering if you were worth saving. Excuse me? I thought you wanted me to help you out of here, Dr. Sagias. Then help. [phone ringing] You reached security, this is Greg. How can I help you? Yes. Hi, I'm Grace Choi. I'm one of the archeologists working with Sagias. I was wondering if I could speak with him. I'm afraid that Dr. Sagias is in a meeting. You have to call back later. He's in a meeting? Did he go to the site? No, I just buzzed in his lunch about 10 minutes ago. He's been at the museum all day. - Okay. Thanks. - Of course. Is there anything else I can help with? Is there anything wrong? Could you have him call me when he's done? Tell him it's important. Certainly. I'll have him call you back at once. Thanks, Greg. - Harold. - Yeah? Toss me your radio. [clearing throat] Patrick? Quinn? Come in, over? Can anyone hear me, over? Come on. Follow me. [distant sounds of battle] What is all this? A sentry station. Guards? For what? Fenrir. Nick! - Nick, stop! - At last. Stop. I'm sorry, but there are procedures for stuff like this. I'm sorry? You can't just take things from an excavation site. We have to log it. But more importantly, we have to get out of here now. Dr. Sagias... Open the urn. - Nick! - Now. Open the urn. Patrick. Patrick, stop! I can't breathe. [choking] Much better. Thank you, Doctor. Without your assistance, I would've never been able to retrieve the Great Wolf's fang. You can't remove that. I don't understand. Who are you? [laughing] Where are my manners? Why, I'm Loki. Get away from him. That's not Nick. That's the guy! That's the guy that got past me. What do you want? What's rightfully mine, of course. He's controlling Patrick somehow. Grace, we got to get out of here. What have you done to Patrick? Well, unfortunately, Odin made it so that a God is unable to unearth the Great Wolf. So I needed a mortal, and the good doctor here was willing and able. And now that I have the fang... there's just one more thing to do. [screaming] Patrick! - No! - Get out of here! Go! Save yourself! Go! Ah! You heard him, save yourself. - Go! - Save yourselves! Go! [growling] Ah! - Are you okay? - Yeah, I think so. [chuckling] There he is. I was wondering when you'd show up, Thor. Looks like you were not as good at hiding your whereabouts as you think. You will pay for your crimes against Asgard. Crimes? What crimes? Liberating this planet? Freeing the mortals. I believe you're the one committing the crime, Thor. [roars] [shouting] I'm afraid it's too late, for Fenrir is awake. [growling] [shouts] The end of the world is near. I must run. No. No! Loki! Loki! [panting] - You okay? - Yeah, I think so. Wait, Grace! Wait, wait. Excuse me. Hi, uh... I'm, uh... Grace. I'm Dr. Grace Choi. I'm site manager at this excavation. Um, uh-uh. That's Loki, so... You must be Thor. You know of my name? How? Well... the hammer. Mjolnir? You know of it? Norse mythology is my specialty. Well... Not mythology, I guess. You studied us. Then you may know where Loki is. You can help me. Um, maybe? The fate of your world depends upon it and your knowledge of us. Well, when you put it like that. Come with me. Okay. The Fang of Fenrir. Do not touch that. Wait, what happened to the markings on your face? War paint of the gods. It manifests during battle. Wait-- hey! That's Yggdrasil, the tree of the Nine Realms. You know of it? Yeah. Basically each branch holds a part of the universe. Earth is part of it. This is what Loki is after. He seeks to destroy the tree and plant a new one that he could control. And that's why he needs Fenrir? Loki can destroy the tree. But attacking each realm, that will be difficult. Fenrir will grow stronger and bigger, and he will devour each realm. Where's the tree? My father said it's nearby. Fenrir was imprisoned when he got too close to it. The gods stopped Fenrir. We are just mortals. No one is asking you to do this. I will take on this challenge myself. No, we can't let Patrick die. Your friend is right. Fenrir grows more powerful and your friend, he will disappear forever. We can stop them. This is what I like about your kind. The odds are against you. Yet you choose to fight for one another. - Can we fight them? - No. Just tell me where they are and I will fight them on my own. No. You want my help, that I'm going with you. Me, too. Stubborn, foolish. But full of heart. Fine. We will travel together. So where are we going? Loki has awakened Fenrir with the Vargr amulet. But he only has one half. If we find the other half before he realizes his mistake, we have a chance of stopping Fenrir from devouring the tree. So we have to locate the other half of the amulet. Indeed. - Sagias. - Yes. - What is this? - Not a what, who. Doctor Nicholas Sagias. If anyone knows where to locate the second half of the amulet, he does. [rumbling] That is Fenrir. He grows more powerful by the moment. If we do not stop Loki, Fenrir will be unstoppable. This hammer is amazing. No one can wield Mjolnir... unless they are worthy. Of course. [car horn honking] This is the most impressive form of transportation. Have you been able to reach Dr. Sagias at all? Mm-mm. Our knowledge of you mortals is flawed. What do you mean? Well, the last time our paths crossed, you had swords and ships. When was the last time you were on Earth, exactly? Long before your time. We humans have come a long way. [rumbling] [shrieks] Another quake? Hold on. Hold on! - What are you doing? - We have to get to Nick. I'm gonna drive right through. We don't have another choice. [shouting] [panting] Oh, fantastic. You would have made a most formidable Valkyrie. [laughing] I'll take that as a compliment. Please, don't do that again. Yes! Again, again, again. Let's go! Yes. [door closing] Hello? It's Grace Choi! Quinn, try and reach Nick again. Okay. Step aside. I will open this door. Sorry. Adrian? Sagias is just waiting for you. Come on in. So, is this a cosplay thing? - What? - The guy in the costume. No. I'm Thor of Asgard, Son of Odin. Of course you are. Dr. Sagias? Oh, hey. So is this... Thor, our Norse god? The one and only. - I know it sounds... - No, no, no. [speaks Norse] The end of days. [speaks Norse] Ragnarok. And? So, he knows the... the ancient tongue. That doesn't... that doesn't mean anything to me. Okay. So he's Thor. Got it. We are wasting time. Do you know where the other half of the amulet is? I assume Patrick is the human host for Fenrir the Wolf? - How did you... - Well, he's not here. You would have said something if... if he died. Right? Because Fenrir needs a human host. Correct? They are becoming more frequent. Fenrir grows more powerful. As I said on the phone in the van, this is why we need the second piece of the amulet of Vargr. The full amulet is the only thing that can stop Fenrir and prevent Loki from destroying the world. So you know what it is? Come with me. That is a burial boat. Not meant for battle? Meant for travel to Valhalla. You should not have taken this from their tomb. We study it. Learn from it. You have cursed yourselves by disturbing the dead. What are those statues? - Jormungandr. - The World Serpent. We almost lost them in the quake earlier. We secured them as you guys arrived. Those are one of the crown jewels of the exhibit. Jormungandr is a child of Loki. Why do you have this cursed thing here? - Thor! - Whoa, whoa! They must be destroyed. Wait! Very rare and extremely valuable, this stuff. We're here for the amulet. Let's just get it to you so we can leave. Great. Come, Fenrir. Soon. Soon, my child. Right here. The amulet. Beautiful. When we put these halves together, we will stop Fenrir. Now, how do we find Loki? [phone beeping] Oh, my God. I have to go home. I have to find my boyfriend. Is this even possible? Australia and New Zealand. The tsunami is heading here. [phone ringing] The earth will quake. Floods will come. The end is near. We need to get to higher elevation. - I have to go, I have to-- - Hey, hey, you need to stay with us. We'll leave together. It may be too late. Ragnarok has begun. Fenrir. Why do you hurt? I don't understand, you... you should not feel pain. You can't. What am I missing? What is happening? What is happening? ODIN: Loki... You've made a grave mistake, my son. Odin. - Odin, you are dead. - ODIN: Am I? You are dead, you are no more! And you are in Asgard. No, no, no. Just more of your tricks. I killed you. And yet... You stand before me. No, no, it's-- it's just an illusion. Maybe my time in Valhalla was not yet. Maybe you're scared. You're scared, that's why you came back. No. I came back to warn you to stop this foolishness. This trick of yours will backfire. The prophecy has been foretold. I will start the end of days. You will be dead before you find the other half of the amulet. The other half? You would have figured this out eventually. But I have a deal for you. Stop this right now and come... sit beside me. And we shall rule together. Together? You must think I'm mad. No. The end of days has been foretold. I will win. I will destroy the Nine Realms, and Fenrir will hunt you down in the halls of Asgard and eat your heart out-- oh, glorious Odin! [laughing] Odin! Odin! No! Odin... Odin. Come, Fenrir. We must find the other half of the amulet. Now. [Fenrir whimpers] [sirens blaring] Grab whatever you can. We have to go. I know. We should wait here. Loki is coming. We have 15 minutes before this whole building will be underwater. Please just grab what you can and let's get in my car. Loki is coming here. No offense, but you are immortal. We are not. We need to leave. You have something that belongs to me. You are playing a dangerous game, Loki. - We need to leave. - Let's go. Give me the amulet, and I promise your deaths will be quick and painless. [screams] [grunts] [shouts] [grunting] [thunder] Stop this madness, Loki. Never. [shouts] What are those things? Looks like Loki's let out his children. They're blocking the exits. We gotta get out of here, or we're going to die here. Wait. What are you doing? Wait! [shouts] Hey, hey, what are you doing? These aren't going to do anything against those animated sentries. I don't think we have any other choice. [grunting] The amulet. [screaming] [shouts] No! Loki! [Fenrir growls] Where did Loki go? He fled and he possesses both halves of the amulet. Fenrir will be unstoppable now. I'm sorry, Nick. We have to go. The tsunami will be here any minute. If we stay here, we're going to die. We'll figure out another way as we get to higher elevation. [rumbling] This is not your time to enter Valhalla. Adrian! I could not save her. Nick. [sobs] We lost her. We lost her, we lost Adrian. We-- We lost Adrian. We lost Greg. And we lost the amulet. It's okay. - [sobbing] We lost everything. - I... can't get them back. If we can still find the amulet... can you save us? Is it too late? It is never too late to give up hope. It's going to be okay. It's going to be okay. I can't do this. I can't. Can't bring them back. Okay? Odin, father. Bring your daughter home. She waits for the final journey. Has she earned her place... Or in darkness to roam. She's gone. Okay? - I'm here. - Do you think we can stop him? Humans... have endured a lot of suffering and almost extinction but we survived. Plagues, famine, drought, everything. But you know what? We survived. And we will survive this, too. You have got to hold on-- we have got to make something of all of this. Absolutely. Good. Nick, we need to find the laptop. I know. Did you find it? No. Something better. It's a Valknut. The symbol of Odin. Your star. It's a catalyst. It can open a portal for communication. What about up here? With connection, power. Things like that. Father. Father! I thought surely that Loki had taken you from us. My death was not to be. Mighty Odin. You can come. You can come to Earth and help us. - We need you. - I can't. I'm too weak. I'm amazed at this connection. There should be no connection between the Realms with me in this shape. Yes, well, the mortals, they have the Valknut relic now. A relic from a-- a time long forgotten. Yes, yes indeed. And Loki? What of him? Fenrir has awakened. And Loki has both halves of the amulet. Earthquakes are-- are shaking this planet to its core. And the flooding is wreaking havoc everywhere. Has Loki approached the tree of the Nine Realms? [Thor muttering] I'm not sure. Then time is not on your side, my son. You must kill the beast before it gets strong enough to devour the realms straight from the tree. I fear this is too much to ask of them. - Them? - Yes. Mortals. Morals have been accompanying me in this, and they've been valiant in their efforts to help. Help is good. Listen, if you cannot reclaim the amulet, there is only one other way you can destroy Fenrir. That which can create may also destroy. Father... the connection is weakening. Do you know, where is Loki, where is he? The Valknut is not strong enough to keep the connection. Where, Father? Where are they? Loki is... with Fenrir in Vigrid, the fields of battle. There exists a bridge between worlds. It's... it's a cave. There you will find Yggdrasil. Father... Father! Father, please don't go! We need you. I need you. Father, please! Please, Father! My father... he's alive. - My father's alive! - That's good, right? Yes, yes. Yes. There's still hope. If we can find Loki and Fenrir, and defeat them. So he's sending help? No. He's far too weak for that. He must regain his strength first. We can't wait. We have a plan. I will find Loki. Where is he? Did your father tell you? Yes. Yes, he did. He's near Fenrir's tomb. There's a cave. Yes, I know, where we did our site survey. It's a few miles east of the dig and the sequoias. It's by Boyden Cavern. It's very deep. [rumbling] This structure is going to collapse. You'll survive. We won't. We have to get off the roof. I understand that. But Main Street is under the Pacific Ocean right now. This is our safest place, right here. I will go find Loki, and I will come back for you two. Maybe I can get one of the... benefactor's helicopters, but even if I can get one, it'll have to be far enough away from this water. Wait. Of course. - What? - Your idea. - What idea? - The water. The water. I can't swim with this leg. Who said anything about swimming? Do you have a question? Thousands. Why did you leave Earth? I never left Earth. I just was not needed. But you're needed now. To protect the Nine Realms. Yes. Why does saving us mean so much to you? Your world is a part of the Nine Realms. And I am the protector of the Nine Realms. My grandfather... he created this world. He gave his life for it. His flesh and blood. Made the mountains and the sea. My father Odin... He was the caretaker. And this is where I met my beloved Sif. Ahh, the golden haired goddess. Where is she now? Asgard... with my father. Wait. You see that? - There, see? - [cawing] The Ravens. Huginn, Muninn. Odin's messengers. They only answer to him. He said he would try to send help if he could. We need to follow them. Are you sure? I'm certain. He must know where Loki is. Is he sending any more help? I think we're going to need all the help we can get. I do not know. Sending his ravens may have spent what little power he has left, but he knows how valuable this world is. It cannot fall. We need to dock the ship and start climbing. We may get more waves with this tsunami. What choice do we have? You okay, Nick? I'm good. Let's keep going. What's Asgard like? Much like this world. It's a wonderful thing. Your planet is beautiful and spectacular. Yet Loki wants to destroy it. Loki does not see Earth the way I see it. He sees Earth as power and control. In the stories I was told Loki was a trickster, a rabble rouser, not someone who wanted to destroy the realm. He seeks to control the realms, but in reality, he just wants a playground for his dark fantasies. Loki's not happy unless he is tricking or deceiving everyone. He will not be happy when he realizes he's only fooling himself. Let's hope he never gets there. Unfortunately, it is pre-ordained. Fenrir will grow, and he will devour the tree. Loki will kill my father, Odin. I thought you said that-- He is destined for these things. But you're here. You're here to stop it, right? Yes. But you said it was preordained. Loki wins. Every story has a writer. Every story has a predestiny. But not every writer is the same. Not every story is the same. So there's a chance Loki's story doesn't end the way he wants it to. Now you are getting it. - Okay, Doctor? - Fine. - We can come back for you. - No. I'm okay. You can get on my back. Uh, no, I'm okay. Thanks. Nonsense, come on. Okay. Here we go. Yeah. All right. Thor is carrying me. That's what we're doing. Oh, yep. - Thank you. - You're very welcome, friend. [cawing] The Ravens. They're saying Loki is this way. I don't see another entrance. Is there another way in? Let me speak to you for a minute. - Really? Now, here? - Yeah, yeah. Right now. We're out of our league here. We're going to help. We're playing with the gods, and their games. We're just mortals. - I understand. - No, you don't. Loki's dangerous enough on his own. But Fenrir, this wolf, it's a whole 'nother thing. We have Thor. Ragnarok. It's the end of the world as we know it. - It's not 100%. - Close enough. That's enough for me to try-- hey. As my old mentor used to tell me, we have to make this matter. Wait. Loki's in there. I can sense it. Move away. Stay with me. I can see the way. There's no shame. You've gotten this far. No. No, let's go kick some Norse god's ass, shall we? Come on. It's the Tree of Nine Realms. The Tree of Nine Realms is very powerful. Loki will need all his magic and tricks to destroy it. And once he destroys it? He will plant a new one. One that he can control. And then he will control all the realms in the universe. How do we stop this? You don't. You're too late. Fenrir, kill them! Go, now! Come on, Thor. [growls] [shouting] [grunts] [whimpers] Nick? Come on. Nick! Back here. Are you okay? Yeah, yeah, I think so. Do you see Thor? No. Grace... You know he's a god, don't you? Who can get hurt. We have to find him. The rocks are loose. I think we have a way out. - We have to hurry. - Okay, let's go. [panting] [grunts] Oh, that wound looks nasty, Thor. I hope it doesn't hurt too much. I do not need my lightning. I can defeat you with my hammer. Fenrir! [barking] [shouting] [Loki laughs] [shouting] Feel my power, Thor! Enough is enough. [laughs] There you are. [gasps] Thor! Nick, we have to do something. Enough with this nonsense, mortals. You cannot win! It's over. I have the complete amulet. Control of the Nine Realms and the Great Wolf is mine once again. If you don't mind, I have a tree to plant. Thor, my son. Awake. Where am I? Where is this place? You don't recognize your home? My home? My home. This is one of many possibilities. But only one can be real. And that is up to you, and what you decide. They are unstoppable, Father. Father, what more can I do that I've not already done? The floods. The floods have nearly consumed the earth. And the tree is almost dead because of my failure. They may be near, but the earth is not lost. Why do you consider defeat when the Earthlings fight on? They may have their problems, but when they're faced with death, they rush in head on. They will die for the right cause without worry. We could learn a lot from them. You are Thor of Asgard. Son of Odin. A great, great warrior. Thunder and lightning beckon at your call. My power no longer answers to me. Your power has not left you, my son, it has just been corrupted by Fenrir's bite. I am not strong enough without it. You don't need to defeat Loki. Ragnarok lies down with the Beast. It always has. That beast has no weakness! Everything has a weakness, my son. I would not have entrusted you with this task if I did not think that you could do it. Remember who you are. And remember what you have. I cannot do this without your strength, Father. It is impossible. My strength has and always will be with you. Wait, Father, please. Please don't go, Father. Please wait, Father. It's all right, my son. You only have a short way to go. The earth needs you. Your friends, they need you. They fight on, but they cannot defeat Loki. They need Thor, the God of Thunder. [grunting] [shouts] [snarling] Thor, stop this! Accept defeat. Never. Then I will make it a quick and painless death. Fenrir, destroy him! Thor, the fang! [shouting] Patrick! You have killed Fenrir. You have killed my wolf! [Thor chuckles] The earth still stands, brother. You have not won. You still mock me! I may have lost the realms, but I will have vengeance. I will kill you once and for all. You couldn't kill Odin. Brother, you will not kill me. Odin is gone. Odin is dead. - Odin is but an illusion! - [laughing] Oh, stupid brother. How do you think we found this place? Even weakened, Odin has managed to defeat you. Even with your planning, and your power... - Careful. - And you have failed. Because that's your destiny, brother. You will always fail! As long as there is someone to oppose you. No. No, no! [screaming] [screaming] Earth will never fall to the likes of you. How? You are but a mortal! How? Surrender and I will spare your life, brother. - Spare me? - Yes. Spare me, oh brother. Spare me this nonsense. Please stop, brother, please. So what? I can rot in that prison for your worthless father? Stop. Stop. No, never again. Never! - No! - This ends here, brother! No! Loki! Brother! Grace. Grace-- Grace. Is it over? Is Loki... Loki is dead. It is over. Come, let's go. That hammer of yours, it's pretty heavy. You are a true warrior, Grace. Only the worthy can wield Mjolnir. Nick. Nick! It's over. We stopped Ragnarok. So what now? [growling] I thought you killed Fenrir. He should be dead! Patrick. Grace! Are you okay? We need to get him out of here. He needs a doctor. Oh, good to see you. Is Earth okay? It is. At least for now. That's a good sign. A good sign indeed. They call me home to Asgard. Will we see you again? If you need me, I will return. Your world is under my protection. Did you mean what you said? About Adrian and Greg in Valhalla? Yes. Your friends will be celebrated amongst the gods. You have my word. Still a mess. A lot of lives were lost here today. Yes, there were. I'm sorry for your losses. Thank you, my friend. Thank you, all of you. You're so brave. It is time. Stand back. Okay. So I met a god today. That's above my pay grade. Man, that guy's awesome. Yeah, he is. [distant cheers] Thor! [laughing] [chattering] Father. Rise, my son. Rise. And what of your brother, Loki? Father, he is... he is dead. He left me no choice. He would not yield. If I had not stopped him, he would have destroyed the Nine Realms. I should have known. He was a fool. But he was my brother, and I loved him dearly. Still... you did something good. The earthlings are a resilient people. In times of crisis, they come together to help their fellow man. Thanks to you, they have a chance to rebuild. The earthlings and Asgard will forever be in your debt. Oh, Father, I... I did not have the heart to tell the mortals that... Fenrir still lives in this amulet. His soul forever. [sighs] All of this was prophesized, and the end was because of all of our decisions. Come. Rejoice! Rejoice, for the Nine Realms... are at peace once again. Thor! To Asgard! ALL: To Asgard! To Asgard, my son. Yes, Father. [cheering] [thunder crashing] [music]
