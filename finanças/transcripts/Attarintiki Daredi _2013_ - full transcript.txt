(tyre screeching) Who are you? (door slamming) Leave me...leave me... (gasping) (burble) (sobbing) Do you've tissues? First settle your issue. (rustle) Why did you bring me? Didn't bring but kidnapped you. (tapping) Why? Why do we eat biryani? For strength! Why do we kidnap? For money! Unable to get the call through. Till the man who engaged us to kidnap you comes here, please tell your story to pass the time. I'll tell if you give me phone. You want phone? Don't you want police station address? Take it. (thud) But don't make any call. No SMS too. (blips) He came to my home 3 months ago... I thought he loves me. I eloped with him. But now he says he came for my mother. For mother? Have tea. Tell clearly. This story started in Milan 3 months ago... Where is it? Italy! Where is that? Europe! Where is that? Do you want geography of the place or my history? Tell me. There's a super rich family known as Nandas! There's an old man known as Raghunandan in the 11th floor of that office. Did you love him? - I loved his grandson! Is he rich? Rs.1 lakh crores! One lakh crores?! How many zeroes? You gang can settle down in life if you sell his wrist watch, okay? That's why he's so proud. Do you remember ISF? That's investment fund, right? It holds 7% of shares in our company. A man known as Praveen Nalla has bought it. What does he want? That chair, father! Oh! Tell him to buy spending 60 Euros. He's buying our shares spending 100 millions. Threatening, those who refuse to sell. To tell the truth, he's stooping down to hooliganism. Whatever he may do, our family holds 60% shares in this company. 40% only, father. 20% belongs to your daughter Sunanda. She didn't any attend board meeting in 25 years. Didn't claim ownership. That's why he started buying our shares. Talk to him. He owns a yacht, he lives in it, neither he picks calls nor attends meeting. How do we catch him? How is he getting our details? To let in fresh air, we open doors, father. Dust too enters along with it. Why don't you tell Gautham? So many of us couldn't do anything, what can a lone man do? Hey, bullet is just half an inch! But it kills a six foot man! How would it be if the bullet is six foot tall? My grandson Gautham Nanda is like that! Raghu, no...Raghu... Hey...ssshhh! This meeting is over. (burble) Hey...hey... (splash) (background music) (panting) (fan whirring) (clanking) (helicopter fan whirring) I am seeing him! I got him! Yeah, it's him...it's him. He's unarmed. He looks dangerous. Go down...go down... (helicopter engine whirring) Hey, hands up! Don't move... Don't move! (rustle) (gunshots) (helicopter engine whirring) Crap! I don't know what happened! Rewind and see! Okay. (rustle) (gunshots) (gunshots) (gunshots) (gunshots) (gunshots) (thud) (gunshots) (gunshots) (gunshots) (helicopter engine whirring) Do you think it's great to kidnap me from my boat? Do you think it's great to buy my company's shares clandestinely? You can get energy if you eat the apple on your table. But if you try to steal another's apple, look, you've to be brought here by force. May I ask you a question? What do you get buying my company? Happiness. (gunshot) (gunshot) (gunshot) - Hey! Yes, this is fear! (painful moan) This is pain! How would happiness be? Find it. Is it in money? Is it in clubs with girls? Or is it in the soap the girls use? Till you find it, don't ever dare look at us. There's a chance you may find happiness if you go searching. If I kill you, no one can find your body too. Hey, don't play with mane of lion because it is sleeping, likewise don't dare get yourself photographed with it. (gunshots) (gunshot) (engine buzzing) (gunshot) (gunshots) (chuckle) Did you ask him, what happiness is? (chuckle) But, do you know what my happiness is? Umm... All these chairs must be filled. With my daughter, son-in-law and granddaughters. This room must get filled with their laughter. Then, my heart would be filled with happiness. In 3 months, I'll turn 80! (chuckle) I used to get a gift for you on your every birthday. Will you get me a gift this time? Will you bring your aunt here? Will you stand up? Eh? You've been restricted to a wheel chair for 2 years now. Will you get up from it? You can't get up, he too can't bring her here. Hey... You sent her away, why are you shouting on me now? Yes, I got angry since she married against my wishes, I sent them away, now I want them back. You've been thinking about her for 25 years, did she ever call you at least once? She's a girl, she'll have pride. I'm your son, father, I too have anger. We came here leaving motherland to make him forget about her. Where else can I take him, so that she'll leave him alone? Father...father...umm... Father, like we're facing a problem, a village got flooded, a man started swimming to other bank with his wife and children, unable to carry the weight, he dumped his wife, then dumped his daughter, lastly he dumped his son too, he reached the shore alone, but all his life, he thought of the three people he dumped, and spent his life in tears. Whether it is luck or not, we're still carrying him, shall we dump him midway? Or shall we carry the distance with difficulty and live happily thereafter? She won't come, it's your madness, she'll not come. (purring) Every year we send clothes, jewels and flowers on her birthday, they come back to us withered and crumpled. He shuts himself in his room for 10 days disappointed. Banging his door continuously, my hands and heart have become hard. We don't need her. No need to think of her. Father! Father! I got up! I'm standing on my legs! Will you bring your aunt here? In search of cloud that has migrated from sky... The sky itself is going to foreign... In search of the rain drop that fell from the peak... It has left residence to go into exile... Is he mighty, archer, sun or a demon? He's a man of steel... He's powerful lightning... Is he protector or defender or is he expert to test fire itself? A strange war without an enemy... A wound down deep in heart... A walking courage... An epitome of bravery... A tough heart to take any poison... He's a six feet bullet... He's a rocket fired by courage... Bill, please. He paid the bill. Thank you. He paid for our lunch. He's the sound of silence of rays of fire that engulfs the world... He's the unseen hailstorm that lashes the earth... He's the fury of rough sea hidden inside a conch... He's King Ashoka to overcome sorrows... He's a six feet bullet... He's a rocket fired by courage... He shows the place of origin to the branches that left roots to grow... He shows east to the Sun which changes direction to set in west... Is he Ravana or Rama or Krishna to win over hearts... Is he a soldier or worker or a man to do impossible... He's a six feet bullet... He's a rocket fired by courage... In search of cloud that has migrated from sky... The sky itself is going to foreign... In search of the rain drop that fell from the peak... It has left residence to go into exile... (whizzing) This is Hyderabad, sir. Traffic is too bad, Goddess Peddamma Talli is famous god. Sir, she's your aunt Sunanda. She was thin earlier but now little fat and strong. He's your uncle Rajashekar. He had curly hair, got rich and lost the curls. They used to have a 3 star hotel, now they've a 5 star hotel, which is running into loses, your uncle is lawyer in court, your aunt is the judge in home, they have two children, two brothers and two wives. Eh? I mean each have one wife. Tell me about my aunt not about useless things. Without knowing these details, how can you plan and take aunt home? Rama planned to build a bridge after reaching sea, he didn't plan a bridge in forest before coming to sea. I didn't mean like that sir. - Will you please keep shut? For your good... (slap) Why not just put a plaster to his mouth? Sorry boss, didn't get that idea. Did you get hurt, Balu? - No problem, sir. Umm... He says no problem, what if anyone attacks me? Eh? Ummm? That's okay, where's uncle's house? It's in Jubilee Hills, but he's in that bus. That bus? He's returning from Chennai. Where are you going, sir? - To follow. Then? Hey Balu... - Sir! Did I write any book on 'How To Bring Aunt Home'? Just do whatever you feel like doing. Is there anyone to receive us or not? A new batch is waiting for us, sir. Come. - Come. (engine buzzing) I want a car urgently. - Car...? (engine buzzing) Hey, that's my car! - How much? Is it taxi to ask about fare? - What's the price? Rs.70 lakhs! Pay him, Balu. What's this man? Take American Express cheque that's equal to cash. Would I give car if you pay cash? Should we give a warning too? Taxi! (engine buzzing) Thanks. - Eh? (engine buzzing) (moaning) (gasping) (engine buzzing) (gasping) (knocking) (footsteps) Sir! What happened, sir? I think he's having an heart attack, need to take him to hospital immediately. A small suggestion. - What? He'll die in 5 minutes, after that your aunt would become a widow, right? It's very easy to convince a widow and take her home. What do you say? (slap) (phone ring) Rajarathnam, I need little time to settle your loan. Would 50 years be enough, madam? I too have eyes, I too can see angrily. Be on the job. I think we need some dignity here. When you sought loan, I want 10 crores and 25 crores, you speak very well in chaste Telugu, when I ask you to repay, you start speaking in English. You build this hotel with my money. They want us also to pay bill for a coffee here.- Hello... They'll not repay the loan. Madam, your husband is in James Hospital. He had an heart attack. Am I narrating Benhur film as a ballad? Why am I blabbering alone? Jesus! Why should I lend money and get hurt? When good people are hurt, they cry. When bad people like me are hurt, they'll make others cry. I'll wait for the time she has no kerchief and make her cry. (background music) There's much better hospital 5 kms away from here, why didn't you take him there? Cemetery is just 2 kms away only. Had he delayed by few minutes, you'd have gone there. He brought him here at right time. You better thank him. I expected she would thank you profoundly, but why is she holding collar and scolding you? If she's a person to pause for a moment and think, why would we come this far, Balu? How are you now? The man who brought me here... Murthy! - Madam! Tell driver to bring my briefcase from car. Take a lakh from it and give him. Okay, madam. You gave up billions to live with me. But today I'm still alive because of that man, can giving money show our gratitude, Nandu? Hello! Madam is calling you. Umm.. One minute... Keep the phone on, you'll know what I'm talking to them inside. Okay, sir. Don't be sleepy, be alert. - Okay, sir. Your name? Siddharth...Siddhu! What do you do? Call ambulance driver. Driver, sir. What's a driver doing in airport? That is... - My fiancé is in Dubai. I was working in Dubai, just now came to India. Did you come for short period or for good? Actually, there was a fire accident in the place I work, actually I saved my boss Sheikh, his wife and kids. If you save anyone, you must get a raise in pay, why would anyone fire you? Actually according to Dubai rules, since I saw their women, they said sorry and sent me away spending as much money as possible. firing me as their driver and send me away. Without bothering about money, send the driver away. Why are you telling this so many times? To make us understand. Driver! Excuse me. If you deliver this suitcase, what would you get? What else? I'll get salary this month also as I get every month. If you give it to us, you'll get a 70 lakh worth car. Why are you thinking? You're talking but not giving the keys. Take it. Take it. Why did you bring it? What happened to the driver? He left the job. - Why? He said he would buy a 70 lakh car but not work for you. By the way, who are you? - Patient on that bed. Sir! - Eh? You can't have children anymore. - I know. I think he left the job for you. If you don't have any objection, you can join us as driver. I'm in difficulties losing my job, why would I've any objection, sir? If you're in difficulties, it's like Ambani is begging. Appointing him without knowing his credentials... Murthy! - Madam! You're damn lucky! Salary expectation?- As you wish. To pay him, your entire family must rob a bank. Day after tomorrow is auspicious day, join the duty. Okay sir. - Come. Bye, sir. Worship lord of the lords... O glorious lord.... Worship lord of the lords... O glorious lord.... He's enemy of demon King Ravana... Most valiant Lord Rama... Worship lord of the lords... O glorious lord... Like waves of fragrance of millions of flower filling the air... He moved like breeze with smile... To move stones with the wetness of warmth... He came down like the benevolent rain God... He's sky, a never ending void... Melting clouds are his domain... He's the one who burns down the differences... His eyes are illuminating the world... Protecting relationships and lives are his forte... Worship lord of the lords... O glorious lord.... Worship lord of the lords... O glorious lord.... He's enemy of demon King Ravana... Most valiant Lord Rama... Worship lord of the lords... O glorious lord... Wow... (claps) Morning, sir...morning. - Thanks. Why are you watching so intently? They dance for us, right? - Is it? Bend your head...bend! I'll pluck out your eyes. If you're so possessive, don't have daughters. If you do, then don't teach them to dance. If they show it is glamour, if we see it's vulgar. People are taking our lives. - Am I? Madam! May I? Sure...sure... - Thank you. Aah! Hey...hey... (giggle) What's this? This is a home with girls, why are you taking so much liberty? Be careful. You chide like this and get her married to some sadist from IIT. He'll use all his intelligence to torture them. You'll know then. Who is he? - He's... I'm Siddhu. - Nice meeting you. Pleasure is mine, madam. Why are you shaking hands with driver? Leave her hand. You come, madam. It's okay! Thank you, madam. - So, cool. Nice! Your dance very nicely. - Thank you...thank you... Your eye brows were like reverse Nike symbol, you moved it fantastically up and down! Are you really a driver? I'm... - He's returned from Dubai, come sir. You go. - This way...this way... Enough of seeing her. - Bye. I'm telling you, 9 to 5 is your duty hours, Saturdays and Sundays are holidays, no holidays for festivals and no bonus too. When madam presses this bell twice, you must come immediately. If she presses the third time? - Another driver will come in your place. (shriek) (thud) Oh my God! Can't you see a man falling down? Why should you shake hands with a driver? (giggle) You... You won't long last. Really? Let me see! Who is he? - New driver. Is it you who took my brother to hospital? He doesn't look like a driver. So, use him for household work also. What's the priest doing here? Women have taken a vow to offer prayer if brother comes home safely. Give the list to me. Incense sticks? - Got it. Flowers? - Keeping it there. Camphor? - Got a kilo! Betel leaves? - Ready. Coconuts? - In store room. Why are you looking at me? Am I so handsome? No...he said coconuts are in room, get it. Why are you looking perplexed? Didn't get me? Why are you still here? Go! Oil, nine grains, flower garlands, well made list. Don't know whatever I eat gets stocked here! (panting) Thank you. - Welcome, madam. (shriek) What happened? Who is he? How could he enter my room? Who asked you to enter her room? You told me to get coconuts from upstairs... Coconuts are in store room. He pointed the finger up... Pointed up? Will you go wherever I point? I would show up for God, will you go up there also? Why are you making it a big issue? Shameless girl! He made the mistake, why should I be ashamed? Why did you do like that? You appear to be a good man. I didn't know putting zip is such a grave mistake, madam. If I hurt you so much... I can correct it immediately. How? - How? Like this! Aaah! Will you zip up and down madam's dress? Is she a mannequin in shop? Get out...get out. Hey...what happened? - What am I to tell you, sir? Your second daughter Sashi's dress, he zipped and unzipped... I can't tell that, sir. He doesn't know where the coconuts are? He knows where my heart is, right? There are girls in this house, how could you behave like this? Remove him. - What's this trouble in prayers? That's it, sir. Whatever you may think, he's not right for this home. She's the one to decide what's right or wrong to this home. Fill up the tank. It's like bringing home a snake. What can we do? Hello, madam! You are...? - Nurse! Nurse? - Yes. I expected a lady as nurse. Ladies are becoming expecting mothers, so I'm here. Are you disappointed? - No, nothing like that. Oh crap! It's like a heroine taking bath in oil and coming out without wiping it. Use olive oil. For lunch make omelettes with egg whites only. Add milk with spinach, it's good for heart. Okay, what should I cook for you? That list was for me. How would I know what patient's requirement is? Please ask him. Oh! Why are you giving pose like Pedarayudu? Do you consider yourself a big business magnate? Why are you acting like a billionaire? Why is he silent? You don't have the body language of a driver. Do you know that? Drivers used caps like this in 1960's, sir. In 1980's caps disappeared. Now they put caps on owners and drive the cars. Are they item girls to show bodies? Where's the body language? I've planned that too, sir. NTR as driver in film 'Taxi Ramudu'! Oh I see...get in... Good day...good taxi... I'll tell you the story on the way, come... ANR in the film 'Donga Ramudu'. Drop the kids in school. Driver is new, show him the way. Who will pay the taxi fare? Would your father pay? You're a driver, show some respect. Get my luggage. - Who is he? He's Chiranjeevi. - He's doing it very well. He's not acting anymore, sir. - Why? His son is acting now. What are you doing then? I'll mix all this and fix it. You get me ice pack. Any progress in aunt's matter, sir Very good. If my uncle comes home drunk every night and beats her, she would cry for leaving her family, but the matter here isn't that, they've made her sit on a golden throne! Bloody progress! Why would aunt or uncle come if you act like driver or cleaner? They won't come. (shriek) Do you've any idea? - No... Don't criticize without an alternative. They'll get angry. My uncle isn't keeping good health, if he knows the reason of my coming here, won't he kick the bucket in shock? I'm sure he would. Is my relationship with aunt any good? It's worse! Won't she throw me out if I tell her? She'll surely. I must tell her at an opportune time, right? You must tell at right time. To tell her, I must be in their home, right? You must, sir. To stay there, other than as driver, what else can I do? Nobody can do anything, you've to be a driver. Tell that to him. Extra-ordinary, sir. There's no truth in it. I swear, sir. There's no feeling in your praise. - How can it be, sir? Only fear rules in situations like this, sir. If you pass comments on people who pay you salaries, your live will turn upside down, bloody idiot! Got it? - Got it, sir. Get the fool down. I'm like a knife, I can cut vegetables as well as necks. I don't have emotions, only duty! This dialogue isn't matching this scene, sir. Does Mephistopheles beard suit you? Are we not tolerating it? Shut your gob and listen. Good night, sir. Sir, this is your daughter's Harvard application form. These are bank account statement details. This is scholarship form. I need 10 latest photos of your daughter, sir. Is it okay to give like this, father? (shattering) Why are you getting tensed? I didn't commit any murder. Just got married, that's all! Father, he's Shekar, he did Master of Law. He said he would die if I don't marry him. I threatened him that you would die if you marry me. He didn't get scared. He asked I'm an ordinary advocate, would your rich family accept me as their son-in-law? I told him my father too came from ordinary family. My father loves me dearly. I told him my father wouldn't say no to me. He would watch like fool whatever I do, I don't give him a damn, if you want, see it, did you marry to show him this? Father, that is... I hugged you when you cried, but if you go against, I'll rip you apart. Just got married... just got married? I'm planning to send you to Harvard. Why did you make me stand here? I wanted to make you sit next to me in board meetings. But you tonsured my head cleanly. I'm conducting a sacrifice for your well being, and you're taking my life here. Father! - Who is your father? I hoped you wouldn't say a word if I married him. If you really had trust on me, you shouldn't have come after marriage, you should've come to me with him before that, you should've sought my permission, I'll not accept, you must make a plea, it'll take a year, 2...may take 4 or 5 years also. You must wait till then, and then marry him. That's what you should've done if you really had trust on me. Didn't you find anyone better than him? He can't even be an assistant to a junior lawyer in my office. Father, look from my side. I can see future with him, I can see a family! I can see your ruination! Why don't you please listen to her, Raghu? (slap) He too is advising me because of you. Go! Go...go...go away! What are you looking at? Go away! Go! Go! I wanted to you to share my wealth equally with my son, you removed me like a speck of dust. (sanskrit hymns) What's this, father? - Stop the sacrifice. I mustn't hear her footsteps in this house. I mustn't see her smile on these walls. (crackle) Nothing she likes or her clothes, her connection with this family, her right to be heir of this family, her blood relationship with this family, nothing must remain! Remove it! Good morning, sir. - Morning. (indistinct English song) Sir, dust! - No problem, Balu. Looks like that male nurse has seen it, what am I to tell him? Let's tell him the truth. He would understand it. What's in it? I can understand Telugu very well, tell me. Nothing, I'm not a driver but Sunanda's nephew, we own many steel factories in Spain, I'm here to convince my aunt and take her to my grandfather. You like her elder daughter Pramila, if she says yes, you'd marry her too, right? Am I right? - Wow Guru! That's it. - How could you? Because I'm also a billionaire like you. I sell plastics in France. I've joined as nurse there to marry their younger daughter Sashi. Wow! What a coincidence! - What? I mean coincidence! That's why steel and plastic have mixed so well. Right, isn't it? I'll beat you with slippers. You'd have missed your bus, he would've given you lift, door would've got stuck, he would've opened it for you, seeing dust on your pant, he would've dusted it. For that why to lie about steel factories in Spain and Sunanda's relative. I'll get angry. I'm telling you, you own this car, you're their driver, what I say is final! Why are you dressed like marriage band? Change it, I'm getting irritated. Why did he brush it off as marriage band? Did you get it now? The world never believes if you tell the truth. Be brave, I'll go to work. - Okay sir. Madam! Sorry, it happened unwittingly. Actually Murthy, accountant Murthy, he guided me wrongly, it happened like that, I'm really sorry...sorry. You? Siddhu, your driver. (sighing) Look Siddhu! If that chair hurts my leg, taking a photo of the chair, keeping it in my bedroom, would I decide to take revenge on it? Why would we get angry on chairs? Isn't it? You too are like that to me. Why would I get into trouble with chairs, sofas, drivers and servants? Go...go, mind your business. (sigh) Aunty, geyser isn't working. - I know. Why? - No power. I want hot water. Ready! I'm in bath towel, send it up. I'm working, I can't come now. I'll not accept if you don't bring it. Your husband will get it for you. Eh? If I had husband, he'll not only bring water, he would apply soap to me also. Send it up! Why did you come here? Bucket was lying downstairs. If so, would you bring it? They told me to do any job on joining day, right? That's why! Would you murder if asked to? What can be more comfortable than murdering in a lawyer's home? Aren't you ashamed to enter a lady's bathroom? Look at that lizard! How it is ogling at you! Would you stop taking bath because that lizard is seeing? Lizards, insects and drivers like me, you mustn't bother about them, without bothering about them, take a good bath. I'll wait here only, if you want I'll get another bucket. Are you daring to take on me? I'll get you thrown out from here in a week. Many make great effort to make others laugh with their jokes, but when you get angry, you make me laugh out loud! Are you making me laughing stock? I'm not afraid, I'll take bath. May I remove the towel? May I? But I don't see men taking bath. Hey... How could you get a heart attack? You take good care of yourself. What happened really? That day after I had lunch, I was feeling little uneasy, moreover flight journey, feeling heaviness in chest, thought it could be gastric trouble, after getting down, I had Eno salt, when I was driving, there was a severe pain in my left hand, I understood, I felt I'm finished, I wanted to open the door, I wanted to open the lock but... I felt if someone had come to my help. But I couldn't do anything. I was not able to do anything. Then, he came at the right moment. Breaking the window and taking to hospital is like a dream to me, my wife, my children, my brothers, their children, all are very young, not one of them is married, only that was in my mind, strength of a thread is known only when it snaps, value of relationships are realised only when we leave, it's true, not just for me, he came for my entire family, thank you...thank you... What else can I tell other than this? Had my mother been alive, she would've built a temple for you. What would your family have done in this situation, mummy? I don't have anyone, they're all dead and gone. (background music) Brother! If you go out, get me two cigarettes. Buy few beedies too. What? - Buy beedies, don't feel shy. (slap) - Oh my God! Beedies? You too get cigarettes. (slap) - Oh my God! Why are you beating me? - Should I get you cigarettes? (slap) - Oh my God! Do you know with whom you're talking to? You're not worth even to wipe my shoes. Should I get you cigarettes? Come...come out! Come...come... - I asked you friendly. Please listen to me, sir. Did you see that coffee shop? - I've seen it. Was it there yesterday? - No. I don't know what coffee I would've, American, filter or anything. It was opened for my sake only. - Is it? For me only! How dare you ask me to get cigarettes! Will you buy beedies for me? (slap) - Oh my God! Come here. Did you see that shop here yesterday? No! If they ask for vegetables or coconuts, I don't know to shop, so thi s shop is being run for me only. They'll keep everything packed and ready. What did you ask me to do get now? Buy cigarettes for you. If I get cigarettes for you, will you gift beedies to me? (slap) Come here, did you see cans in his hands? Did you see? One has diesel and another has petrol, I don't know what to fill in which car, when I apply the brake, they'll come and fill it up, they'll fill up the tank, what did you ask me? Should I buy cigarettes for you? Cigarettes? (slap) So many are working for me to keep me a driver, are you telling me to work for you? Already they say we're dead. - Is it? How would an extra large sixed man feel in small size? I don't know, sir. - Show him. Why is coming behind me? What's he going to do? I'm getting suffocated! I'm too had the same feeling. Same feeling. Should I buy you cigarettes? (slap) - Oh my God! Why are you beating him, sir? Ask them to beat him. Were paying salaries. - That's true. Yeah. - Go ahead. Come on, beat him. Sir...sir...please move, sir... Sir...sorry, sir! I thought you were joking. Are you my brother-in-law to joke? - No sir. Balu! - Sir! Compared to my earlier days, I'm cooler now, right? You're much better compared to early, sir. You've calmed down. You're cool now. Right, I too noticed it. - Yes...yes... Pay and send him. Give it all. Sir, its Rs.10 lakhs, he can't handle it. Oh! Sir...sir...thanks, sir... What's the number, brother? You were right, Balu. He can't handle too much money. If anyone give Rs.10 lakhs, break it open and take it, why are you asking the number? (bang) Hey, luck is knocking your door, Padhu! But bad luck is firmly locked inside your bedroom. So, manage with this Rs.1000 for now. Enjoy! - Enjoy? Do festival! Festival? - Yes. Bye...bye... Hey, Gaurav! - I don't want, mummy. (english song) Where are you going? I told you about Wednesday party, right? The line mustn't be seen. Can I wipe it, mummy? I'll kill you. If I mean shouldn't seen, wear a dress covering it. Go! Please... Go! Playing fool with me. Siddhu, we need to go out. Where to? Fire in eyes! Oh my God! Are you going to a party? Yes. But you promised to go by evening. Mother asked us to change the dress. We got late. I've been waiting here for you since long time. Madam, if you don't mind, can I say something? I'm finding it difficult to hold it. You're going to a party with such long dresses, what a traditional family yours is! We can hardly find anyone like this. I'm really very proud, madam. To get associated with your family, it's the good deeds of my early life to get associated with a family like yours. Siddhu! - Madam...madam... See on the left side! Mother goes regularly that side to reach her club. Is it, madam? - Look on the right side... Look at that coffee shop... Sister loves to have coffee there only. - Oh, wonderful, madam. That's on my daddy's office route. - Yes madam. If you go that side, we'll reach our hotel. This too. Can you the building on left side? I learn to play piano there. Fantastic, madam. Wonderful, madam... wonderful, madam. Hey! Did you change dress while telling me address? Are you disappointed in missing it? Why are you inciting him? Siddhu, have your dinner and wait for us. Sure, madam...sure. - Come. Go...go... (phone ring) Hello! Whom do you want? Sashi...somewhere here only... I'm Sashi! Poor man may be here for us. He won't come in the way unless he gets ragged. The Sashi I'm searching will be half of you. Am I so fat? I was saying about height. How am I? - Very good. That's all? You're beautiful too. - That's it. You're sexy too. What's your name? Siddhu...Siddhu... Siddhu! (moans) Did we meet before? No...never... Promise, this is the first time. I mean it. - Come with me. Why are you man handling me? Please...Oh God! Yuck! What are you drinking? Vodka. Oh...excuse me. Yuck! What's this? - Cocktail. Have you stopped having plain water? Umm! Oh my God! Oh my God! What a boy! He has filled my heart without leaving a millimeter place... Like a terrorist with dagger like eyes... Like a sorcerer with hypnotic eyes... He's troubling me... catch him...catch him... It's time to party now... It's time to party now... Sing whatever you can mouth... Dance whatever your body can... It's time to party... It's time to party... Drink whatever your hands lay on... World is a swing, swing to your heart... It's time to party... It's time to party... Come on...come on... chill it...chill it... Come one...come on... let's rock it! Come on...come on... let's rock it, shake it... Come on...come on... let's have the fun! It's time to party now... It's time to party now... Come O girl... It's time to party... let's rock it... It's time to party, now... Come O girl... Are Tatas and Birlas greater than us? Oh my God! What a boy! He has filled my heart without leaving a millimeter place... Like a terrorist with dagger like eyes... Like a sorcerer with hypnotic eyes... He's troubling me... catch him...catch him... I'm like the filament in Edison's bulb... Your mere touch can switch me on... I'm silent fire like microwave... If you give me your heart, I'll show you my talent... It's time to party... It's time to party... Hey boy! Are you a clone of love code? Hey girl, so much following for just one look... It's time to party now... It's time to party now... Come O girl... It's time to party now... let's rock it... (unknown language) My name is Margareta, I was born like a cocktail... Steal my beauty with your eyes... Youth is a garden of flower without a watchman... If you invite, I'll land like a dragon fly... It's time to party... It's time to party... Hello...hello... Hey boy, should we invite you? Baby...baby... Hey girl, don't you want me to enter the arena? It's time to party now... It's time to party now... Come O girl... It's time to party now... let's rock it... It's time to party... It's time to party... It's time to party... My red dupatta is flying in wind... My red dupatta is waving in air... Hey! - What? Why did you stop us? I'm off duty now, right? Start the car. Have you gone mad? Huh? Have you gone mad? Who would be madder than you? Hey! Do you feel you're a great beauty? Here comes Queen Victoria! While creating Lord Brahma took lunch break and left you half done. That's why you're so... Hey, I'll kill you! Hey...hey... Pramila madam, please come here. Wow! Look how docile she is. Look at her patience. That cuteness. Look at those big eyes! Any man would love to fall into it and take a swim. Thank you. Don't look down, fans like me would get hurt. Why are you feeling so shy? He's scolding me. - He's not beating, be happy for it. Be happy. Moreover he's drunk. Indeed. Give the keys. You're off the duty, right? Give the keys. I'll get you fired from job. Oh mother! If I lose my job, how would I eat food and take bath? I'm really scared, mother. If half built house like you is so proud, I'm tall like a seven story building, how proud should I be? What do you say, onlookers? (moans) Hey Sashi, soot of the house! She's crying! Start the car, for my sake. Not just car for you, I can take her life also, madam. Come. Sashi, come. What do you feel on seeing the eldest girl? I feel the dress is too short. I feel she would become our madam in short cut. You mean they... - Enough, let's move. Oh God! Oh God! Good morning, madam. Yes...you only madam. Do you remember what you said last night? It wasn't me, madam. Oh! - Umm... I'll tell my mother about last night's incident. Not only this, you'll lose job and roam on streets. Please madam, don't hit my livelihood. I've only one job, I don't have money also. Mother! Madam, please, madam... Madam... - Mother... Don't hit the livelihood of a worker, madam. Don't hit his livelihood, it's wrong, madam. Mother, last night Siddhu created a big scene. Okay, call him. Siddhu...Siddhu... Siddhu! Mummy is calling you. Madam. Take out the car, need to go out. - Sure, madam. Bye madam. (snigger) (engine buzzing) I thought hotel owner means very old woman. She's very young. Those who took loan are young but lender is getting old. I'm not refusing to repay the loan. How will you repay it? I'm discussing a deal with a software company, if deal is okay, for next 3 years we'll 40% occupancy. That'll not materialize, madam. Simple, your hotel would get raided tomorrow, we'll catch few call girls, company would tear the contract and walk out. Don't unnecessarily go against ego. Look at my face, do I look like a egoistic man? If I remove my beard, I'll be like Amul baby. Really, sir. She need not repay me, I'll pay 25 extra, tell her to give the hotel to me. Am I asking too much? Never heard any better deal than this in my life, madam. Jesus! Are you ready? I'm ready. If you're adamant like this, my man is short tempered. Unnecessarily in angry mood he may harm your husband. Why would I not get angry? When I eat salt and spice! I'll get angry. I'll do something, I'll cut something. Cutting this or someone's neck aren't much different. That will move when I cut and this will not. That's the only difference. Go to road number 12! - Madam! What you're doing is wrong, sir? Keep your hands on heart and think. I'll never keep hands on heart except while sleeping. Who are you, man? - Me? I'm a driver. Why are you discussing with a driver? Throw him out. When an ACP is here, how dare you beat my men! I'll kill you! Are you a goon? You mad man! Have I come to any exhibition? To watch if you fire at me! One who fears will shout and brave will bear it. No need to tell which category you belong to. Are you a great man if you beat four men? I'm old city Parameshwar! Every Sunday I play card game with Home Minister. State or central? Call him. - Sir? He told you his name, right? Call him. Sir...sir...I'll call him. Hello... What? What's that built up? Who that man is in half suit? Who are you calling now? Will you settle things on phone? Should we accept your phone settlement? My hair has turned gray, I'm using dye. You'll get the call. (phone ring) Hello! Who is it, brother? What happened, brother? Down your gun! Down it. Sorry, sir. I don't have any connection with him, sir. They invited me for marriage and offered chicken, so I came. Chicken isn't tasty too. What happened, brother? Asking me, what had happened? I'm finished. Before calling me for any settlement, know the back ground of people you're facing! Call from central Home Minister. Gave me a lesson on phone. He wants me in Delhi by tomorrow. Are you watching any film? You'll die man! He's dinosaur, run away! Sir, am I still in the post or dismissed? You come here, sir. I'll find and tell you. (screeching) If you give loan, should they've to sell their hotel to you? If not will you kill them? If they sell, buy it, that's business. Don't try to usurp it. It's outrageous! I'm here to protect her. Who is there to save you from me? Sir, he may die in fear. My anger isn't easing, what am I to do? Come here. Hey you! Where's my hand and where your cheek is? (slap) (siren) I'll not beat you this time. If the torn agreement doesn't reach her hands in 30 minutes. Lord Jesus! Please don't finish that sentence. I'll not give you that opportunity. Trust me. Do you've paper and pen? To respectable sister Sunanda, madam, you're like a sister to me! Madam, you're like a sister to me. It was my mistake to behave like that with you. Here's the agreement you singed. I'm giving it back to you. If you need any help in future, I'll do it as your brother. For whatever had happened... - I'm ashamed of. What do you say for forgive in Telugu? Please forgive me, madam. What happened? An hour ago, Satan took over me, madam. I wanted your hotel. Now, Jesus is in my heart! I'm returning it to you. Why did you change dramatically? When I got her to sign by force, nobody asked me why? Now I'm reformed and returning it, why are you asking so many questions? Yes, no need of details when rogues reform. Not that... - Madam! There's a great power behind you, madam. Till that is with you, nobody can dare touch you, madam. Lord Jesus! Why was he looking at you, Siddhu? Nothing like that. He did! Keep quiet, don't say like that, Pramila. (giggling) I'm sacred, Pramila. There's some magic in you! Anyone would fall for it. She rolled her eyes like top... She rolled her curls... She made me roll over her sexy waist... Oh God! She's Bapu's girl... Oh my God, she's a jasmine twig... She took the colour from rubber bangles... She applied red colour on her cheeks... She flew me like a kite with her ribbon... Oh God, is her sight gum? Oh God, she's an enchantress... She felled me with her rosy lips... She won over me waging a war without swords... She danced on my heart... Watching her dance steps, I lost my sleep... Oh God! She's Bapu's girl... Oh my God, she's a jasmine twig... Humming a song while drying clothes on the terrace... She sang a song to squeeze my heart out... While serving me with a glass of coffee... Touching me with her gentle body... She electrified me with inciting desires with the live wire of passion... She seasoned me like they do while cooking vegetables... Wherever she looks, it appears like she's seeing me... She stitched into my heart the thread used for making flower garland... She imprisoned me with sari end... She says hello early morning... She invades my dreams as night falls... All her memories haunt as far as she goes away... Oh God! She's Bapu's girl... Oh my God, she's a jasmine twig... She gently pushed into some magical world... She locked the door and lost the keys... She carried my heart to the clouds... Without making noise, she took away the ladder... She took my heart in her hand and closed the fist... The wind of her beauty raised me back into life again... She imprinted many a sweet nothings with her thoughts... She put goggles of love to my eyes... Princess of Kosala, a beautiful girl who raked up desires in me... She made me a garland of beads and wore it around her neck... Oh God! She's Bapu's girl... Oh my God, she's a jasmine twig... Eating ice cream... (laugh) Don't tell my mother about eating ice cream. She fears I may put on weight. I don't like smoking. Come closer, I'll tell you a story. Two thieves from Stuartpuram went to steal a home, both of them faced each other, if anyone of them shouts, inmates would wake up, they'll thrash them, so both of them cleverly did one thing, both shared equally the booty, and went away as they came. What's the moral of the story, dear? When you have an ice cream, I'll close my eyes, when I smoke cigarette, close your nose. Mind your business. If you want, take it. Do you know them, Pramila? Umm? - No. Why are you beating up while talking to her? What were you talking to her? Her ear rings were nice, inquiring about where she bought it.. Mummy bought it. Who are you calling? - Her mummy. To know where she bought it. - No need. No? When you don't need it, why were you asking silly things? There's a rule to tell lies too. At least one of the gang appears like buying an earring. Everyone appears like a thief! (slap) He may get hurt, Siddhu! Mad Pramila! What are you saying? I hit to hurt them, right? Strongly! Driver! Siddhu! That's why people have names. Instead of rings and bangles, buy something useful to men. Am I right, Pramila? - Umm... (thud) Move! (tyre screeching) Take care of him! (engine buzzing) Rajesh, get the bike. What are you looking around? Sister must be with me in 5 minutes. Do something. Hey...hey... (engine revving) (engine revving) (creaking) (clanking) (tyre screeching) Still got 2 more minutes in the time you gave me, get your sister, go. He's near her. He doesn't have courage to kill anyone, he doesn't have commitment to die too. Get her! Go. (engine buzzing) Who are they? - I don't know, father. Can you recognise them? - No. Why didn't you go to police? We mustn't leave such incidents simply. It's time for wedding invitations not court summons. Well said. We mustn't go public over such issues. We must cover such incidents under the carpet. Don't arrange felicitations to Siddhu for saving her. By the way, what happened to Siddhu? He beat them, how can he get hurt? He may have beat them, he brought you home safely. Call Dr.Navin here. - Okay, brother. When he was angry, my father used to do just like this. My brother used to tease me that I too have the same habit. When I left home, he had a son of this height. He was very intelligent. When I say fill the tank, any driver would ask for money, he won't leave with the keys, he doesn't know that, I and your father grew up together for 20 years, I can see him in you, when you speak, I can hear your grandfather, can't I recognise you? He can throw out his daughter from home every easily, but I can't even dismiss a car driver. That's why you're still here. Has your grandpa lost his grip due to old age? Did he ask you to bring me? He didn't send me happily after I got married, he sent me away with my husband bleeding. (crackle) Is that all you can do, father? When police said about threat from my enemies, Father, let's sit and talk it out. Father, please!- I know! But my enemy was born in my home.- Father! I raised her myself. - What are you doing, father? Father! I'll wipe her out myself. Father! This is what I can do! (gunshot) Shekar! (thud) (moaning) (painful moans) Father! Shekar! Shekar! We didn't come here expecting you'd welcome us, father. I thought you'd understand us. I know you'd shout at us. I thought of enduring it. I expected your anger, father. But I couldn't expect your hatred. You killed me there. You died here. The place where my husband's blood spilled is cemetery to me. Come. Please Nandu, listen to me. Don't worry brother, I'll not file a case on father. Come. I'm not angry on you. Because I've to remember you for that. I don't like it. I don't lose anything if you stay here. It isn't of any use to you. But one thing, Shekar got a heart attack as soon as you came. You saved him. Hotel is in problems, you solved it. Today Pramila got kidnapped, you saved her. If these incidents had happened naturally, it's okay. If it was planned and solved by you, impressing us and were planning to take us to your grandpa, I too have a gun and license for it. But I won't miss the target like your grandpa. (squirting) I saw everything sir. You both had a good talk. Who? You both! (Slap) Who were talking? - She talked, sir. Why did you say both then? I thought you'd convince your aunt and take her to your grandpa. Grandfather? (Slap) She was talking, how could she get convinced by it? But she knew I was Gautham. We got caught playing hide and seek in a floodlit stadium. Like fools! Did your aunt chide you in front of entire family, right? If we were just two, why would entire family be there? Bloody idiot! - Thank you, sir. You're not fit to talk anyway, you're unfit to get angry with too. Sir, if you promise not to beat, I'll say something. Cry it off! Nobody else knows that you're her nephew other than your aunt, right? No, she won't tell anyone. Take advantage of it and use it. Don't beat around the bush, come to the point directly. Tell you love her with aunt's elder daughter Pramila. Would she follow me if I say so? She's crazy about you, sir. She'll die for you, sir. On hearing your name, she'd say beau...beau... Balu, finish it quickly. I'm dying with tension to hear rest of it. Tell me what's next? She loves you very much, sir. She'll eat you alive with her eyes, sir. Just go to her and say I love you. She'll immediately follow you like a Pomeranian dog. Your aunt will also follow you in the next flight. Balu, you did make a valuable suggestion. I want to kiss you. (sigh) I lost my confidence hearing my aunt's chiding remarks. Balu, I need little encouragement. Ummm...ummm... Ummm... What do you want, son? If Pramila sees me? - She'll get tempted. If I talk to her? - She'll melt. If I touch her? - She'll get connected. Ummm...ummm... If you stay here, you'll get late. Ummm... (cracking) Hey! What are you doing? Stop! Why did you stop me? - Why do you want to kill yourself? Why should I live? Will you stop asking questions and answer me? Why should I live when I don't get what I like? I think she knows I'm going away. Why will you not get it? What you like is right before you! It's yours any day. Not mine. She's feeling because I'm a driver. Prami, I'm not a driver as you think. - Yes, you're a rogue. You separated me from my lover. (smashing) Aah! Lover? Who is he? - Rohit, the man you beat in mall. He kidnapped you, right? Had he kidnapped me, I would've shouted, right? We love each other for 3 years now. We had decided to run away today and marry. You spoiled everything. Are you happy now? He's getting married tomorrow night. He's getting married night, right? I'll bring him by morning. He has been taken away by the marriage party. Where? Hmm.. Neelamani weds Rohit! Siddappa Naidu is village head of that place. One daughter and two sons. Second son is very violent. He cut the hand for stealing his daughter's bag. Can you bring my future husband from such a house? I'll bring. - Will you go now? I need little time to recover from such shocks. I need time. Meanwhile, you take a bath in the tub. Use drier to dry your hair. But don't join both, please! It's my responsibility to unite you both. My responsibility! I can see the marriage canopy... The auspicious time to unite... Did you hear, sir? What a situational song! (slap) Open the suitcases. Continue the stay in hotel. Keep plane in parking bay. Take me to a hospital. Seenu! - Sir! I want to go to Chittoor, get me a vehicle. One of you come with me. - For driving, sir? To get scolded and beaten up when I'm angry. Someone wants to go to Chittoor, a group fell on my feet. You know, I'm very sentimental, he'll drive, I'll show directions. This is Rohit's photo. I'll give their address. He's not that great. Bad photography. Your choice too is bad. Please bring him carefully. She's not saying at least go carefully. Eh? - Nothing. Okay...okay! I'm sure they've stolen something. Mummy... (shriek) (thud) Umm? Umm...? Umm? Umm...umm... Umm.. I don't have any complaint in life without you... (engine buzzing) Girls have no taste. He's like a TV tower wearing shirt. She loves him. She's much better, the younger one will surely select a terrorist. What are your sweet memories with her? Nothing sir, recently she said I lost my purse, and asked did you take it? Why didn't you hit back with slippers? When I asked why? She said purse rhymes with nurse, so I asked you. Rhyming? If she loses a tractor would she ask a doctor? No need to think of her, sir. Seeing her is bad omen and crossing her path is death. Looks just like her. Oh my God! Do you've to travel so long to reach from there to here? Respect? You didn't get hurt, did you? (music of Ghajini playing) Order two dosas, please. - Two dosas, brother. I think she would've fallen into jeep from balcony. She has lost her mind. It's amnesia, Padhu. When will she remember her past? - 3 pesarattu. How would I know? - Pesarattu! Isn't it? What happened to me? Nothing, your parents didn't agree for our marriage. Add onions in pesarattu. - Why? You're my aunt's daughter. Our families are at loggerheads. That's why we've eloped. Don't use oil, use ghee. Don't I've sisters? You've a sister, she loves someone. A sand laden lorry hit him. It's not wrong to add cashew nuts too for them. Who is he? - Doctor! He prescribed medicines for you, right? Isn't it, doctor? Clever boy! Where's his stethoscope? I sold it to buy diesel. Don't bill them. Beau! Eh? You're my beau, right? Right! When she addresses me like that I'm overcome with feelings. Beau! You're rich, right? Problem must be in your home, why are we facing it in my house? She has forgotten the past but not logic. A fear the rich kids have bad habits. Naturally! But you don't look like that, beau. Thank you. Actually your grandpa is the only one to agree for our marriage. Is he any less? He has left billions for you. No need to talk about that now, Padhu. Just for information, right? Sashi! - Beau! Would you like to speak to your grandpa on phone? Umm...umm...umm.. You sit as it is. Grandpa!!! - Talk! (blips) Hello! Give phone to grandpa! Sir, Gautham. How are you, sunny? Would you like to speak to your granddaughter? Would she speak to me? Talk to him. Grandpa, I'm Sashi here. How are you, dear? I'm fine, grandpa. But my parents didn't approve it. How can they accept so easily? What has happened wasn't a small issue, right? Whether it is big or small, it's over, right? Why should we hang on to it for years? Though you're young, what you said is right. Is it wrong to marry uncle's son? Marriage? Nothing, grandpa. - Playing fun with aunt's daughter? Something similar. Shall I call you later? I felt like crying on hearing grandpa's voice. Everything will be fine. - Thank you, beau. Great! Please get up, dear. He's here. What's this? Your love story may be old, but this sari is new, before they finish eating pesarattu please wear this sari. Eh? Take it. Thank you. Go! My pulse rate raced on seeing you... Why is it so? Without seeing you my eyes went hammer and tongs on each other... Why did it do like that? Go that side.. My pulse rate raced on seeing you... Why is it so? Without seeing you my eyes went hammer and tongs on each other... Why did it do like that? Don't know what it is...what magic you spread with just a look... Don't know what it is...you gave me a disease with your body shake... Like a drowning flood, burning fire, you took my life, dear... On seeing you.... My little heart... My pulse rate raced on seeing you... Why is it so? Without seeing you my eyes went hammer and tongs on each other... Why did it do like that? Once more with feeling! Oh no! Such a vast sky...endless blue... How could you fill all that in your little fish eyes? You rocked me! It's true that gold is hidden inside earth... But growing on earth and moving, you've re-written the history... When you break into a jig in sari... Shall I follow you like an ant? When you move swinging like a boat... May I follow you like wind? Let's be together like Radha-Krishna and pain-sadness... Without seeing you my eyes went hammer and tongs on each other... Why did it do like that? Daughter-in-law without mother-in-law is great lady... Mother-in-law without daughter-in-law is great lady... Daughter-in-law...son's wife! Where's cream in fresh milk... Where's moonlight in hot milk... (ovation) Please dance, yaar! Who so ever may have painted the picture of Mona Lisa... I'm sure he hasn't seen the milky beauty of you... What's the use? One who took away the Kohinoor diamond may be a King... Poor man doesn't know the shine of that diamond is in you... If you're born and brought up like this... How much can I sing in praise of you? I've used all the words I know in Telugu to write this song... Like Sirivennela's songs and Veturi's lyrics, you're so sweet, my dear... On seeing you.... My little heart... My pulse rate raced on seeing you... Why is it so? Without seeing you my eyes went hammer and tongs on each other... Why did it do like that? (engine purring) (sigh) Why have we come here, dear? - To take a small parcel. Shall I wait here? Will you wait? My sweet darling, come. What will you do waiting here? You promised to marry me. Will you marry me? - I do. I think you'd go on honeymoon before that marriage happens, come. You go, I'll follow. Come. - Shall I go? Will you wait? - It's not nice, let's go. Come...come... Beau! He'll come back, not going away. He'll come back in few minutes. Come...why are you getting ready? Getting ready to fight? Wait, I'll settle this issue. How? Asking me how? You said you're a billionaire, did I believe it? Let me use the same formula here. If they ask, let's tell them we're here to take away the groom. They'll offer sweets and send us in.- Come. Do something. Greetings sir. - Greetings. Give it. Take sweets. You are...? - I'm bride's second brother. He's elder brother. You are...? - We're here to kidnap the groom. (laughing) Didn't I tell they'll not believe the truth? The groom up there doesn't like your sister, he loves another girl, he sought our help and we're here. Padhu, they didn't ask all that details. Truth isn't a DVD movie! To press pause button as and when you feel! It's a film in theatre! Once the titles start, curtains mustn't come down till it is over. Where's the groom? - Upstairs. This way, sir. Didn't I say sweets? They don't believe if I tell truth also, fools. Truth is like fire. One who says my feel the burn but one who hears will feel its warmth. Keep those things there! They say there's more in a marriage that will stop! Infact I feel pity for these guys! Don't know what it is! Why are you dull? I should be marrying her but I'm marrying her. How would I be other than dull? Stop crying like a girl and come with us. If they know, they'll kill us. They gave your address. Look at this long hair man, he's very good man. He offered sweets too. Who among you is the leader? Padhu sir leads in everything! For what? Why are you looking at me furiously? Will you beat me? (shriek) (splat) (bang) He appears like a good man! Elderly man! Oh my God! One second delay I would've lost my head instead of hair. Oh my God! Did you get it now? Truth burns both teller and listener. Oh my God! They're following us! (engines buzzing) (tyre screeching) (engines revving) Hey! Oh no! They're closing in! They're closing in! (tyres screeching) (engines revving) Go fast! (tyres screeching) (engines revving) (engines revving) Go...go... (tyres screeching) No road, don't go! I should be in home, how did I come here? She got back her past! Oh God! (splash) They're closing in, go fast! (crash) (clanking) Where am I? Don't leave them, come on, boys! They're coming! - Didn't he kidnap my sister? (clanking) Who changed my dress? I'm coming to kill you. What's this? Tell me who changed this? Tell me! Come...come with me. - You did something... So many people are coming! What's this trouble for? Who are you? You don't know, I'm really serious, tell me now! (gasping) (thud) Who is father of the running away man? Who is the father of unconscious man? Umm.. Hey beating up my son, how dare you are talking to me leisurely! Look, in chess board King is an old man just like you, Just one step this side or that side. But why do people call him as king? Because Minister is next to him. That's his strength! Who is your strength? Who gives you the power to twirl your moustache? Whose muscles make you boast? Whose courage makes you take out a dagger? Who is he? He can bring down an elephant with one punch! He's my man! My bull! This is my pride! If you touch it, it's like beating me, if you wear it, it's like I'm dead. Wow! Good timing! If you touch it, it's like beating me, if you wear it, it's like I'm dead. Why not add a good rhythm to it? It could become a good song. Hack him in the name of Ahobhilam Lord Narasimhaswamy! Never step on snake's hood because it's resting. Are you a great man if you beat one man? Each one of my men will play swing with live wires. But never play with power plant! You'll get blown up! One must catch their own thing! Never try to catch another one's, this will be the result. What? Be careful! How can he take him? He must marry my daughter. Agreed it's your daughter's marriage but death to another daughter. Which is more difficult? There's clarity in my question. Would there be surety in your answer? Listen to me, Siddappa! If useful, use here only. Use wherever you can if you remember. I'm like lion. It can't shave and I can. That's the only difference. All other characters are same! Kick of having the last laugh is terrible! Get in! Get in quickly, he may beat me. Before taking such a big decision, you've guts to discuss with driver, but don't you've the sense of telling your parents? No sir... - What no? Who is he? What does he do? How would he look after you after marriage? Don't you want to know anything? What do you say, Nandu? If you love, we'll kill, if you marry, we'll burn you, we're not that foolish to say like this. But we love you. We respect your love. You've so much respect for your daughter's love, that man has got no respect for my daughter's marriage. I wanted her marriage feast to spread the delicious smell to 10 villages around. But this trouble has reached 100 villages. How embarrassing! His father took the dowry, he dishonoured me. My life has become good for nothing. It seems you're a famous lawyer, please do justice to us. Tell me! Have it, sir. The lady who served you buttermilk is my sister. My brother-in-law left her for festival promising come back for her in 10 days, 30 festivals have passed since then, he didn't turn up, sir. If food is left, servants will eat it, if a girl remains in home, you can never eat a meal peacefully. You're at loss if you force your daughter as his wife. Your name... - Siddappa! Siddappa! Tell me what did you spend for the marriage? I'll take it as my daughter's marriage and bear the entire cost. What? Will you pay me? Are you such a great man to buy the honour of Siddappa? Hey! Who said that? Show me! How dare you raise weapon at him! Bring it down. Hey...hey...put it down. This is for cutting crops. Not to cut throats! If you wish to beat, hit this man. he agreed to the marriage without asking his son. Why are they after comedian in the fight between hero and villain? (clanking) They're good people, that's why they're still talking to us, father. Had they been like us, they would've got us thrown out! Sorry sir. In sorrow my father... I'm asking forgiveness on his behalf. It was his mistake to offer your money. For the loss of your honour, honour of my home, we'll give our second daughter in marriage to your younger son. Take her with you, brother. Give her, I'll consider her as my daughter. I'll look after her well. My wife too isn't here to offer you traditionally turmeric and vermillion. No problem. Give her. I don't think you're not here to take your aunt. But to arrange her daughters' marriages. (engines buzzing) I didn't understand why they fired you in Dubai after saving their family. Why should anyone give up a good man? I've started to understand now. We offer prayers to Pipal tree and call it as God, but it grows on our house wall, we cut it. Marriages are happening because of you. But if that elderly man gets irritated with you, marriages would get cancelled. Siddhu, you're like medicine. It too has expiry date. I think you'd have understood me. (background music) (phone ring) Hello! Father! Grandpa is not well! BP is fluctuating rapidly for the last two days. Since morning he's struggling to breathe. He's being given oxygen. Come back, Gautham. Forget your aunt, at least be here to see your grandpa for the last time. No use in me seeing him, he must see aunt. I'll bring her. I'll bring aunt on his birthday. I'll keep up my promise. Tell him to stay alive till then and keep his word. Can you hear me? Tell this in his ears. Tell him to stay alive till I come back. Tell him to stay alive! One opportunity! Just one! He brought me as simple as bringing a suitcase, Prami. Thank you, Siddhu. Thank you...thank you, so much. Why are you praising him so much? As if he won a war against Pakistan. Why are you so jealous? Stay here for few more minutes, your husband will get jealous. Go! You're number one is spoiling any occasion. Sashi, please reduce your anger. Because your fiancé is little mad. So, better cool it off. Whom should I marry then? Whom should I marry? Should I marry one who takes me into his lap and talks? Should I marry one who feeds me fondly? Surprised to know how I remember all this! Yes. Beat that nurse and he... Do you know what my problem is? You! The day you entered home, I liked you! I fell flat on sight! What do you want, Sashi? Little peace of mind. Umm...okay. Bloody eyes! Though I don't want, it's entering my dreams too. Can I marry a driver for that? My sister is marrying an MBA! Her children would study in Oakridge! Will my children study in Municipal school? That's why I used to shout at you wantonly. Go away man! From my heart and my home! When I come near you, I'll get strange dirty thoughts! My heart beat races! Cheeks turn warm! Legs start shivering. Now also! I'm wearing long skirt, nobody can see it. I didn't want to tell you. Anyway you don't have an entry into my home. There's no way we can meet again. That's why I told you. I've to tell you one more thing. Close your ears! I said I want to tell. Did I say you must hear it? I love you! No, go to hell! Oh my God, I can't believe you said that! Or am I dreaming that I might just hear that... My heart is racing like Cheetah... So, I want to sing this new song... Hey girl! You knocked me out with just a slip of tongue... Hey Monster princess, you said I love you biting your teeth... You laid a beautiful trap... Your love gun shot hit my heart... Which is right and which is left...? I'm intoxicated without having a drink... Like using cat ball to spread jasmine... Like a bomb blew under my shirt pocket... I'm getting crazy ideas... You made me go bonkers... You made me go bonkers... Oh my God, I can't believe you said that! Or am I dreaming that I might just hear that... My heart is racing like Cheetah... So, I want to sing this new song... Your lips are strawberries... Your words are Cadbury... You're a walking nursery of flowers of beauty... Colourful gallery of dreams in my eyes... Your mischievous eyes are filled with intoxicants... Aunt's daughter has spread charm of fragrance... Offer diamonds on your beautiful smile... I'll hug as new found love is taking over me... You made me go bonkers... You made me go bonkers... I'm in chaos like sound blast in Goddess kali festival... I'm feeling like I've had drug laced Bengali sweet... Wearing a cowboy's dress... Riding the horse of Rayalu... Staying put on earth... I feel like stepping one moon... Getting incoming calls in a cell without SIM card... Using coal of Singareni as face powder... I'm getting such crazy ideas... You made me go bonkers... You made me go bonkers... Unlike me, tie your husband to apron strings like your mother. You won't spare sister-in-law even in blessing. Isn't it little difficult to bless for someone who scolds always? Murthy! - Madam! You keep pounding! (phone ring) Hello! It's me Siddappa! I called to tell you something. Tell me, brother. Bhaskar, my brother's son. He's coming to your house tomorrow morning. He must conduct this marriage. That's it! Baddam Bhaskar! He went to Uganda with just Rs.2 lakhs investment, he bought a 10 acre farm, he ploughed the land, he hit a diamond mine! With one shot, he hit big time. That's all, in 5 years he made nearly Rs.50000 crores. Thank you. Dry and use it! Don't lose it! Okay? Rs.2 lakhs as tip! Why are you surprised for this? He has a wish to win the coveted Oscar too. No way! So, he instituted Bhaskar Award and produced a film. Film? What's the film? Inspired by Gladiator, he made a film Radiator! How dare you show your back to me! Slave, remove your helmet and tell your name to me. My name is Maximus Decimus Meridius. Father to a murdered son, husband to a murdered wife, and I'll have my vengeance in this life, (lightning) Or the next! He's the director and he's the hero! Our bad luck is, he plays the heroine's role too! Look at that dirty thing! If I didn't have my mom and dad's blessings, I wouldn't have reached this stage, when people who watched this film, and said each scene was like a diamond. Tear are rolling down from my eyes. Why will you not cry? You had to sell 60 diamonds to finish the film, right? (snigger) You must know another detail about him. Madam! Rs.2 lakh investment he stole it from this home only. He worked in your place only. Boss, I've news for you. Some Bhaskar is coming and people here are tensed he may cancel the marriage. Now, your aunt will know the value of our boss. (slap) What would we get if she's sad? She must realize and must come with us. That's our goal, right? Balu! - Sir! Who can stop us if we enter aunt's house along with Bhaskar? Who can stop us? Nobody can stop us. That's why, do one thing. What do you want me to do, sir? As soon as Bhaskar lands in India, we must buy a job with him. Difficult, sir. (slap) Difficult but we can buy, before I could complete, why did you slap me? (slap) I'm getting irritated for giving a pause, how dare you give an explanation for that! Bloody fool! (engines buzzing) The home where I worked once! People who threw me out! Why are they looking at me surprised? Looking at you! What are you doing here? That is... - He? He's my personal. He was working with us till recently. If he quits job with you, he'll become a good man like this. If you throw anyone out, he would become a great man like me. Have it. - Why? I got rank! - Is it? I'll throw up if I eat this. Just wait, Rs.2 lakhs! Buy new clothes. Sir, that's Rs.2 lakhs! After all Rs.2 lakhs! You stole the same amount from this house and got kicked out, right? If you kick, gate too would return in double speed. This is Bhaskar! That's why I came with this speed. I love music! - I love women! Every man has his wish! Making a statement for it. Have it. How come your cheeks have become so chubby? Using any medicine? - Yes, I'm using Homeo. Continue it. All the best. Bhaskar sir is very naughty. Coffee. How many children? - Two! You're maintaining body very well. Why are you struggling? What happened? It's paining. Won't I feel pain if I hold? Go! Says painful, don't I know that? Sir, I've understood now why people clap for hero when he beats the villain. Hair rising! Really? - Yeah! Hey, Bhaskar! How are you? Please hold this! I think she's coming to hug you, sir. It's better to put finger in plug. It's been years since I saw you. If I knew you'd miss me so much, I'd have sent my photo. Carry on with your cooking. Thank God, she's gone. She was really ugly as a little girl in gowns. How come she has grown to be so sexy! (glass shattering) Eh! - What's that? I'll give only expressions, you must do the job. Wait, I'll clear it. Hello Bhaskar! - Greetings, madam. How do you do? - Doing fine, madam. I've little work, I'll be back. Okay, madam. Why did you do that, sir? What did I do? - You bowed to her. I did it involuntarily. Bhaskar, your uncle Siddappa told about you on phone. You must conduct the marriage. - Really? Hey... How much are you expecting from me? Little bit of civility! Civility? Goddess of Wealth wants to enter his home, why is he talking about rules, regulations and signals? He insulted you and hurt us, sir. That's why we stop this marriage and celebrate it. Have some water. Did you see the younger daughter? You love her? I want her! If you want her, you need to meet a man. Who? With a smile and blessing the devotees... And love his devotees... You're rocking...O Babaji.... Changing lungis and wearing it as shirt... When you bend down... You're rocking...O Babaji.... Life without you is nothing but darkness... If you don't smile, I'm in chaos... A bottle of scent or a bottle of liquor is nothing compared to your eyes... You're one of a kind in this world... You're rocking...O Babaji.... You're rocking...O Babaji.... Move...move...move... Plantain leaf for food... tobacco for lime... Touch Swamy's holy feet for washing off sins... Plantain leaf for food... tobacco for lime... Touch Swamy's holy feet for washing off sins... Plantain leaf for food... tobacco for lime... Touch Swamy's holy feet for washing off sins... You're rocking...O Babaji.... You're rocking...O Babaji.... (humming a tune) What's that tree? Baba got enlightened under that tree. That's why it is known as Wisdom tree. Friends, devotees of God! - Lord! People plough to raise paddy! But you ploughed to get diamonds. What else do you want, son? Just because hunger is satiated, do we stop begging, Swamy? I've three wishes. - What's that? I'm here to attend a marriage. Sashi...she mustn't get married! It won't happen! I want her. She'll marry which no one can imagine, is it okay to you, son? Since I won't imagine she'll marry me, so she's all mine. Eh? - Yeah! What else? My mines and my diamonds, my currency and my arrogancy, they must always be with me. What you started with would always be with you, Baddam! Son Baddam! - Swamy! To make all your wishes come true, the tree must be in your home. Tree? Almond tree in the backyard of Bhaskar's home! It'll lift you up from difficulties! Well said...well said... Car can't hold it, Swamy! - It'll come in air. Ever since I came I've seen only applying dot and combing hair, I'm yet to see your face, Swamy! Show mercy on me and show your face once... I beg you! Can you bear if I turn? I'm turning now! - Turning! Don't blame me for the consequences. - I'll not. I can't see anything. - Me too! New devotee has been blessed with Baba's divine glimpse! Hail Baba! - It's your good fortune! You had the glimpse of Baba on your first visit. Why so many covers? If you lie, leaves will fall, you'll die! Let me test it. I look like Mahesh Babu. Leaves fell, sir. I can see it. I'm very intelligent. Fell again. - Fell, you lied. I'm an idiot! - That's true, sir. Not a leave fell, so... - I can see that. Why are you telling me? Why did you come here? Go away from here. I don't want you. No...go away! May I go away? Where do you want me to go? Go away! I hate you. Go away! Who is there? What? What happened? Asking me what happened? Is it respectable house or public garden? What happened, sir? - Asking me what has happened? A girl about to marry is romancing servant... Why are you looking shocked? Am I narrating any epic? They both were in each other's hug. I think people watching it would die getting suffocated. What? What's your problem? You were saying something. Your girl is fire! Leaves didn't fall, sir. I was wrong. Did you observe one thing? - What's it? Leaves fell without wind blowing. That too when you were talking about a topic. It didn't fell earlier and then later, did you observe this? I heard about mad people but seeing them for the first time in life. I think he said something. Nothing, your madam is calling. - Is it? Coming, madam. Is it false that girl and our boy were hugging each other, sir? It could be a lie. But what I'm planning to do with Sashi tonight is real. Bhaskar loves arts. - Is it? Lalitha...Kala... - Who are they? It means fine arts not girls, sir. Since you said fine arts, I mean games like medley of songs and tombola... How about gilli, marbles and others! These are not arts! Theatre! It's on the verge of extinction. We must give a new life to it. He wants to get the second one to bed. I too love theatre, sir. - I'll make you perform it. What's the play's name, sir? - Ahalya is innocent girl! Then, we must find two girls. Ahalya and innocent are not two girls. Ahalya is innocent. So much twist in title itself! You cunning fellow! I've plenty of twists in the story! What's the concept, sir? Gautham and Ahalya are a couple, Indra loves Ahalya since a long time, - Isn't it wrong, sir? If he asks, Ahalya too would say the same, he made a plan, before dawn breaks at 5 am, by 4 am... (rooster cooing) ...he cooed like a rooster! Gautham as usual took the towel and left to river bank for bath. Taking this opportunity, Indra disguises himself as Gautham, and goes to Ahalya, seeing Ahalya with carnal desires, he patted sleeping Ahalya on shoulder to wake her up. (pat) Enough of seeing me, deliver your dialogue. Swamy! Didn't you go to the river? When you're in the room, why would I go to river? saying this he pushed her on the bed, he passionately occupied her. Hey! You went to take bath, right? Why did you come so early? Are you blind? I took the towel but forgot soap. I took a dip and came back. Take the soap and have a good clean bath. What? I said take the soap and have a good clean bath. What would you do with my wife meanwhile? I'm Indra, I can do anything. Then, I'm Gautham. I too can do anything. I'll punch...pinch...bite... (slap) (snapping) (punches) Only one man beat me but why do I feel like many hands? Something wrong. Roles...reverse. (rooster cooing) Ahalya, where's my towel? Patting shoulder... If you pat as and where you wish, why do you need me or script? (chuckle) She got serious when I patted, why is she laughing when he does it? Swamy! - Devi! Didn't you go to the river? You're in my heart, how can I go to the river? (chuckle) Good! We used room in script, right? I think he has improvised it. Didn't you do it by patting on buttocks? How can you compare him with me? I'll show what improvisation is! - Come, my dear... I'm unable to bear this separation, dear. Please imprison me in your arms. What's this? - Please do something. What's this? Leave her! What's this? Didn't you take bath in river? - Am I like you? No bath, I just washed my face, that's all. Why didn't you show this intelligence before? What are you saying? You've such a big watch on hand, if rooster cocks, if you leave a sleeping wife, - So what? people like me would get into the bed with her, right? What are you blabbering? What's that? What's that? Why are you raising your voice? - I'll raise my hand also. (slaps) Why are you beating me? - Not just beat, I'll bite you. Oh no! (punches) (moaning) This time, I'll play Ahalya. Fight and kill yourselves. You get up...get up...go... (rooster cooing) Has it dawned so quickly? Why are you still sleeping, Ahalya? Where's my towel? Pat on the shoulders. Should you pat him also there? What sex appeal does he have? Didn't you go to river, Swamy? When you're in room, what would I do in the river? Devi! - Yes. Come. - You come closer. Hey... Hey... With whom you're having an affair? With whom you're having an affair? - Didn't you go to take bath, Swamy? I did go but suspected you're having an affair with someone I came back. Come, this side. - Okay. Why don't you beat him? I'll beat him but first I'll beat you. I'll beat him later but tell me one thing, What's it? You're my wife for 25 years, right? - Yes. If so, can't you differentiate between husband and paramour? I mean... - You mean? Go ahead. I mean... - You're crossing limits. Do you know what would I do with women like you? Do you know what would I do? - What will you do? May I tell you? - Tell me. I'll tell you...I'll tell you... Not just beat, I must bite you. Bite...bite... (shriek) Do you need the role of Ahalya for your beauty? Why this dangerous desire at this age? I got it now. I'm just a spectator! Fight and kill yourselves. Please entertain me. That's all! (rooster cooing) Dawned so quickly? Where's my towel? I'll see how he can beat me! I'll also see, sir. She's senseless anyway! What happened to you? You know she's not your wife, right? Will you beat her now? - Not her but you...you... Actually I mustn't beat you. Hello Baddam, sir! Do you know what's happening here? - I wrote the play, right? Right? Is he her husband? - No, he's Indra. In such a scene, Ahalya, the man who has come now is not your husband Gautham, he's treacherous rogue Indra, instead of telling her the truth, pushing your pot belly up and pushing everything else behind, what are you watching legs wide spread and moving it? Will you beat me for this point too? I'll beat you on any point. The nation is facing so much flak because of people like you. Thrash him! (punches) Katamarayudu...Kadiri Narasimha... Katamarayudu...Kadiri Narasimha... Katamarayudu...Kadiri Narasimha... Great hunter, I trust you... Great hunter, I trust you... O lord, you rule over me... You mauled the devil with anger... Taking on the might... O lord, you rule over me... You appeared and vanished in a flash... You gave Vedas to Brahmins... O lord, you rule over me... You mauled the devil with anger... Taking on the might... O lord, you rule over me... I beg you, madam, I think he'll kill me. Please send him out., madam. Why are you raising hell? Come here, Bhaskar. I want to talk to you, please come in. What are you up to? If Bhaskar gets irritated he may tell his uncle, and stop this marriage, can you take that responsibility? You want Sunanda. But the woman here is Sunanda Shekar. Shekar won't get separated from my name, Sunanda will not come to your home. Go away...from this home and our lives! Did you get the entire list, Priest? - Yes, sir. Why aren't you still ready? Groom's people would be here in an hour. Does she really like this marriage? You're not having any secret twists, right? Why don't you answer your uncle? Alarm failed to ring, why are you getting tensed for this? Amulu, come here. Saris are upstairs... - Madam... Okay. Definitely. I'll come. I said I'll come. Okay. Cut it. Cut the call. (engine purring) Sashi sister is missing. Her clothes and jewels too are missing. What else? She would've eloped with Siddhu. How do you know? Like this, she said that before me. Why didn't you tell me that earlier? I thought she would forget her love and marry the man chosen by family... Earlier he took away future son-in-law now future daughter-in-law. You said you sent him out of home. Who brought him here again? I know a thing. But I don't know if it is true or false. Tell me the thing, I'll give the explanation. If it's lie, leaves will fall, uncle. What do you lose if leaves fall? Tree will die. If tree dies, I too would die, uncle. What's that nonsense? Not nonsense, I and tree are one and same. We're connected with each other, you know. If you kill a bird with it, you can at least eat it. What will you get if you fire at me? If kept, I'll stink and if you burn, just ash. If you don't tell what really had happened, people will tell tales about you. Why are you so dull? Your mother told me to leave home. Shall we both go away together? - Where to? Chennai. - How? Catch a train. They'll know from my hotel desk if it is flight. Can you live with a driver like me? Any doubt? I don't want anything. True! 4 or 5 crores is enough. - 4 or 5 crores? We need to live, right? (chuckle) (engine buzzing) I didn't tell any lie now, right? It didn't fall for your lies but Siddhu used this remote control. Thimmapur Hail Lord Murugan! Hail Lord Murugan! Hail Lord Murugan! Hail Lord Murugan! Hail Lord Murugan! Hail Lord Murugan! (birds fluttering) What are you thinking? There are many cars in Chennai for you to drive. There are many buildings for me to design. Don't worry. If we don't find any job, if we sell this necklace, we can live recklessly for a year. You don't get tensed. Okay? Without wasting time, if we've a son or daughter, and send their photo, my parents will come for us. (whistling) (clanking) (shriek) Sir, please give me alms! A ticket to Mumbai please. - This train goes to Madras. Give me a ticket to some place, sir. If you don't I may die in suffocation. Do you know to read Urdu? After seeing him beating our men, I've learnt Chinese and painting too. Sit here. Hail Lord Murugan! Hail Lord Murugan! Hail Lord Murugan! Hail Lord Murugan! Hail Lord Murugan! Hail Lord Murugan! Lord Jesus! I'm seeing him for the first time in my life. I made vow to visit Velankanni Mary church on my knees. These are my tickets. This is certificate of physically handicap. You beat me recently, right sir? I lost two teeth. Losing anything which God gave would make me handicap, right? That's why I got this certificate, sir. Can I board the train? Thank you. God bless you, my son. Siddhu! Flight is ready, sir. Why flight? Waste of money for flight. No need to buy tickets, he owns flight. It is ready on runway now. We've taken permission to bring cars on platform, sir. No need. Isn't Siddhu a driver? After seeing us, if you're asking us this question, I don't know if you're mad or foolish! (phone ring) Boss, they're here! Balu! - Sir? I want 0this station for 15 minutes. If you ask suddenly now... There's a price for everything, buy it. What about the passengers? Send them by special flights. If there are no airports, send them by cars. Send a message to Ministry, request the station master. Threaten him if he refuses, if still he refuses, kill him. This meeting is very important for me...very important. I'm giving you 5 minutes. 5 minutes! (speeding train) (slap) (slap) How dare you want my daughter! Come here...come... Nobody can bridge the distance between front and back seat of a car. Aren't you ashamed of eloping with a driver? Leave her. See who is holding whom and then speak! How dare you answer me! I'll kill you! I'll kill you! - Hey, move... I'll kill you. (chuckle) You'd be having a theory why a car driver shouldn't marry your daughter, why a penny worth lawyer shouldn't marry his daughter, her father shouldn't have a theory, right? You can go to his home after marrying. But you can't bear to see your daughter with a suitcase. You'll exile a family for getting shot on shoulder, but you can point a gun on my head! Yours is love and what others do is desire! If you do it is role model, if others do, it's haste! If you shout, it is affection, if my grandpa shouts, it's arrogance. Isn't it? Who are you? The lady you married, I'm her nephew. A man who is burning with the memories, I'm his son! Grandson of a man is fighting death. Thousands of crores, factories in 10 countries, one lakh workers, nothing of this gives us content, we're just poor people. Heir of Nandas! What has changed since then, aunt? It was in grandpa's hand and now he's carrying it. That's the only difference, right? If my grandpa was wrong then, what you did now is also wrong, leave your daughter, I'll take her with me, if you're right now, then he was right that day! You come with me, I'll take you with me. I'm telling you this to convince with my intelligence, aunt. My aim is to tell you and grandpa both were wrong. If the price of his haste is losing you, the price of your anger is losing parents' home for 25 years. The day you left home, had you turned for a second, aunt, you'd have heard another shriek, had you heard that shriek, these 25 years would've been different, aunt. Totally different! You don't worry, brother. I'll not file any case on your father. Come. What has happened to me? Am I God if I make some money? Would I shoot my own daughter? Man like me mustn't live. I'll die! I'll die! - Stop, father! Enough of the disaster this house has seen today. If I die... - No, father... Please don't stop me. No, father... - Don't stop me...don't stop me! Please father... (gunshot) (shriek) (gasping) Janani! Janani! (crying) (pitter-patter) (crying) (crackle) (clank) (speeding train) You left grandpa for hurting uncle's shoulder, what should I do with grandpa who killed my mother, aunt? Why did a gun fire which was silent for 10 years? Isn't it because of you? How much I should hate you and that old man? But I didn't do like that. I grew up holding his hand. Just because he asked me, I came to you as your driver and opened the door for you. Can't you come and open the door of his home, aunt? Every problem in life gives us two ways, One is filled with love and another with hatred. I chose the first and you chose the second way. Come to my way once, aunt. Just once! As a child I didn't know why I had no mother, didn't understand why you won't come, I used to be very angry, aunt, I used to wage invisible war with unseen enemy, aunt. Invisible war! Living good isn't living away, live happily with relatives! Though we earned a lot, we could never fill the void left by you, aunt. Still we keep a plate on dining table, a room in our home, 25 paise of every rupee we earn, we've kept it for you, aunt. We love you so much, aunt. Just say one word, I'll stand guard against all your difficulties. For one mistake, we've been saying sorry for 25 long years, aunt. We're saying sorry! We can't wait anymore, aunt. Can't wait anymore. If possible forgive us or else punish us. But please recognise us for God's sake, aunt! (background music) Make a call, Gautham. I want to talk to father. I'm worried. Where you win isn't great but where to bend makes you greater! Gautham...come. He's no more a mother less child! He has mother now. Shekar, my nephew! Our son-in-law! He's right. - No! He's great! What? What great? Will he use my love to convince my mother? Let him use it, how did you know his history? There's internet on phone, his name gives hundreds of pages. Why did you kidnap me? They didn't do it, I engaged them to do it. Bhaskar? Sashi! We don't want your jewels or your money. Come, boys. Please give me your watch, brother. Why? - As your memorabilia, brother. Is it? Okay.
