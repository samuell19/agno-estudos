No, not there. That way. you two go that way! They're saying Karim is the thief. He even stole the prophet's ring. He's crazy to come here! I hope that when I get caught, I'll be tied up and thrown into the hot oil. - Do you think he's still in the palace? - It would be wonderful if you came in the bedroom. If he dares to come to my room, I will know what to do. How can you say that? You would be as scared of him as we are. I don't. Karim is a man like everyone else. Remember your old nurse 's advice . When dealing with men, have a firm hand. No, Ayessa. If Prince Osmar wants me, I just want to please him. Did you hear that? She is already in love. I've loved him since I first saw him.

We need to search your rooms! - How dare you enter my room? - Forgive me, Princess Amina. But a thief is loose in the palace and we have orders to search everywhere. - There's someone there. - There's no one there! - He is not here. - Excuse me, princess. Stay with Allah. Forgive me, princess. Forgive me. - I think it's gold. - It's very light. I think I should dye it darker. Go, dye it again. Go! All right, expert. Come here and tell me when to stop. Next, please. Ahmud, the mason. If he doesn't pay the owners five gold coins by tomorrow, his daughter will be sold into slavery. Ah yes! There it is. Allah bless you, Karim. May you have a hundred children. Thank you, friend. Thank you. Well that's it for today! Nothing else. What would these people have done without your help, Karim? Someone else would have helped. Farid. Buy yourself some food. Otherwise it won't grow. Thank you, Karim. What can I do for you? you've already done enough. you are the only one in Baghdad who strives to help the poor. That's pretty unusual for a thief, isn't it, Karim? Robbery is the only thing I know how to do. Unless you have another suggestion. Well... it depends. you want the Sultan's job? A Sultan among thieves. By the way, what were you doing in the palace that day? Soon, you will know. Life is a long road. And only Allah knows the route, my boy. Good luck, Karim. Wait!

That is my greatest wish, Prince Osmar. Amina, my sweet daughter. I chose your fiance. Prince Osmar. you will love him and obey him. As you know, he will be your master and lord. Soon, Baghdad will have a new sovereign. The noble Prince Osmar. I have decided that he will take my place when he marries my daughter. I have chosen you as my bride and queen. And I will make Baghdad the most powerful city in the world. Together, our forces will conquer the world. And now, drop the veil, for I want to look at you. As is my right. Prince Osmar will be your husband. You can show him your face. need to get over your shyness, my dear. So let my hand take off your veil. The same hand that will take up arms to defend you and your kingdom. I don't believe in the strength of your sword, Prince Osmar. You can't defend my kingdom if you can't defend yourself against a thief. - This could result in war! - Forgive her, she's just a child. A child to whom I wish only happiness. you were once young. - She'll fall in love with you and then... - I can't accept that! Wonderful! Good, you agree with me. Let's set your wedding date , when my daughter falls in love with you. you have the courage of a lion, but here you will need the cunning of the fox. - Where do you want to go? - Prince, I've known Amina since she was born. - If you take my advice... - Advice? With an army of 20,000 men you wo need your advice. wo n't You won't have to use your men. If you do as I say, you will have Baghdad and the princess without having to fight. And then he will remember his humble servant in his days of greatness. Your humble servant. Princess. you tricked my guards, thief. But I saw him. Princess, I had to come. Why? One day, Allah decided to punish a man for his sins. He put him to sleep and woke him up in paradise. But after a short period, he sent it back to Earth. And from that day forward, even the most beautiful things on Earth, seemed ugly and worthless. That's what happened to me, Princess. Since I looked into your eyes yesterday. No! My father has already chosen my fiance. Don't try to see me again. It's dangerous. Karim, even though I loved him, - we could never see each other. - I'll find a way. I will do something to measure up to you. I promise. Yesterday, I gave you a ring that didn't belong to me. I know. I gave it back to my father. Please keep this. 00:23:16,262 --> 00:23:17,456 Amina! But there's something that has n't been stolen. It was my mother's. I love you, Princess. - Amina! - Wait for me. I'll do it for you. There he is! He's on the roof! - What are you doing here? Go away! - That's what I'm trying. You do n't have time to waste! Get out! Thanks for the help, but I know what I'm doing. Go, everyone! Let's go! But why are they... What are they waiting for? Walk! - Where are they sending us? - Where they take those who don't pay taxes. - To the mills? - Walk! Yes. Close the gates. Gamal, I decided to listen to your suggestion. So listen to this, great prince. This contains a foolproof potion. The girl who drinks falls in love with the man who delivers her. It's absolutely foolproof, unless... . If the girl is already in love, And die. it will wither away. Yes, but since she was born, the princess has only known one man: Her father. How could you have fallen in love with someone? No, you will be the first. This potion will help you make your wishes of love and power come true , prince. It is written that there is no hope for the disease. There is no doubt about it. It's clear she loves someone else. That's why she got sick. Your magician is to blame. - Tell him who he is and I'll have him killed! - That won't be necessary. I want the magician's name , Gamal! - Ignorant... - But it wasn't his fault. After all, he told us what could happen. Let's go in and hear what the sages are talking about. Your Highness, my colleagues and I agree that some principles are at work. Stop babbling! you are here to cure my daughter and not to talk nonsense. They talk and talk... But they don't say anything. - What do you want? - Majesty, an old man is outside. I've never seen him before, but... He said he knows the remedy for his daughter's illness. - Don't you want to see him? - The Sultan is busy. Send him away! No, wait! Whoever... Whoever can help her... ...can to enter. I will see him. So? Great Sultan, listen to your humble servant. Only one medicine can save your daughter. Only one blue rose. A blue rose? What nonsense is this? What do you think we are, old man? Wait a minute. Haven't I seen him before? No, that's impossible, Excellency. A blue rose? You must be kidding. That doesn't exist. Whoever finds this flower and brings it to the princess will not only save her, he will also be her husband. need to understand that this is no ordinary flower. you bring one with you? No, Your Highness. Another will find her. And you will bring it to your daughter. Someone who loves you so much that he'll risk everything. Even your life. Glorious, I'm just waiting for your signal to have the pleasure of throwing that old dog out into the street. That blue rose! Incredible! Listen, order that tomorrow we will celebrate your daughter's wedding to Prince Osmar. And the healthy smile will return to the princess's lips. This man you're wrong. miserable fool! How dare you? I'm going to put you in the snake pit. Take it. It's your belt. I believe in you, venerable sir. But tell me... How does someone look for the blue rose? Whoever wants to look for this rose should be armed with courage, intelligence and love. And he will have to go through the seven doors. The seven doors? The first of the seven doors is to the east. She can be seen where she is not. Gamal! Proclaim to all the people that whoever finds and brings this blue rose will have my permission to marry my daughter and will be the new Sultan of Baghdad. Tomorrow, at dawn, whoever wants to look for the rose must dress in blue and must be brought to the palace, to me. So go! Fast! Open the gates. Come in. Come on. ! Walk. ! At your posts! you there! Come here! Let's go. Take those bags. ! Work! - Karim, what are you doing here? - I have no idea. Silence! Work! Both! Work! I lost all contact with the outside world. - So you don't know. - WHA? Princess Amina is very sick. It's very serious. - Some say she was poisoned. - By whom? I don't know! Nobody knows. I need to get out of here! Need! Need! Look! Look in the sky! Who knows where it will land ? I hear they're the souls of the damned on their way to hell. That's why they leave a trail of fire. Now is the time. Noble guards, you are mistaken. stars turn to pearls. That's what happens to them. Prisoner! Who gave you the right to speak to us? Don't yell at him, this man is smart. Yesterday, when I lost my money, he found it with some magic words. Let's hear your fairy tale, it helps pass the time. It's not a fairy tale, noble captain. Sometimes, on nights like this, the moisture in the air turns shooting stars into pearls. I wouldn't mind if pearls started falling from the sky like he said. - I hope to be around when it happens. - I notice. What would you do if you found pearls? Me? If I got my hands on some pearls, The first thing I would do is buy a young wife and sell my old one. For nothing. Anytime. Look! Look at this! - See how close you came! - There's another one. - I've never seen it so close! - you heard? - What? - Something fell out. Could be... See! What did I say? - He was right. - Let me see. A pearl fell from the sky and I found it! I found! Found it! It's mine! I found! Look! Another pearl has fallen! Another pearl fell there. Let's go. Hurry! The others will get them all! Very well, start walking, but in silence. The time has come. Wait for me! Let me see one! Look carefully, there may be others! - I think I heard another one fall! - Where? - Around here somewhere. - There could be hundreds! They're on the run! Don't let them get away! Karim? you got back just in time. you seem to know everything. Why didn't you help me escape? There are circumstances in which you must take care of yourself. Anyway. See those men? They are going to the Sultan wearing blue, as he ordered. It has been decreed that whoever manages to find and bring the blue rose to the princess, and therefore to heal of your infirmity, will be your husband and will inherit the throne of Baghdad. A blue rose? Dear Sultan, I have the right to refuse to participate in this ridiculous quest. you know you promised me your daughter's hand. However, I am willing to take on anyone looking for that rose. If it exists, I will find it. I guarantee. you were generous, Osmar. Allah will help you find it. If He doesn't help, you'll regret it. I intend to rule Baghdad. Sultan Almighty, the strength of arms is the greatest guarantee of the greatness of a nation. If Allah chooses me as his successor, my armies will be at your disposal. you all know the prophecy. Anyone looking for the blue rose must pass the seven-door test. The first of the seven ports is in the far east. It can be seen where it is not. So take the oracle. - I'm sure I've seen him before. - I'm sure it was someone else. No! I'm sure, right here in the palace, not long ago. you were well dressed that day. Wait... I'm starting to remember. I knew I had seen you before. Right here in the hallway... The day Prince Osmar arrived and... you are the thief! My daughter's life worth more than my kingdom. Your Sultan has just spoken. May Allah be with you all. Generous Sultan, forgive my delay. I am the lowest of your subjects. My name is Karim. Let me look for the blue rose. Karim? Even the humblest of my subjects is welcome. But for what reasons, Karim, do you... ...want to look for the rose? Only one, sir. I want Princess Amina to get well. Let her smile again. This is the imposter Karim, the thief. A man whose head is at a premium. A man who dared to present himself to Your Excellency posing as Prince Osmar. Arrest him! Wise and fair, I appeal to your sense of justice. The proclamation said that anyone could participate in the search. you don't want the people of Baghdad to say that the Sultan has not kept his word. Sure! I wouldn't want to. No, Great Sultan. This man wants to escape punishment by using a malicious argument. If his argument is valid, any thief can marry Princess Amina. Wise, what if I'm the man Allah chose to find the blue rose? Think carefully, sir. It's your daughter's life. Release him. Enough! It is an insult to allow this thief to join us! - You need to decide: Me or the thief! - Arrest him! Take him away! Don't let him get away, you fools! Don't let it! - We got him! - Let me go! That's not the thief. you're right. - There he is! - Arrest that man! He is the thief! Arrest him! - Hold him! - Idiots. me go! Let me go! - Please forgive me, Prince. - You idiot... Please forgive me. Like a servile dog, I beg you. There he goes! - What is he doing? - I do not know! Watch out! This way! Open the door! Open the door! Open the door! Lock the doors! Catch the thief! Catch thief! Catch the thief! He will be here soon. Catch thief! Stop that man! Farid! Farid! - I was looking for you. - you need to go to the princess. Say I'm leaving and I'm going to try to come back with the blue rose. - But how am I going to get into the palace? - Use your head, you'll find a way. All right, I will. Allah was good to me. Now do as I say. - Bye. - Bye, Karim. My lady is not interested in your jewelry. In that case, here's something that will please you. That excellent stuff. Coming from far away China! I do not know. I'll show you and let's see. Amine. Amina, my little doll. You can't keep refusing all of life's wonderful gifts. - Life is not a pleasure for me. - No... have to have hope. The man you will love is looking for the rose. I'm sure you'll find her and bring her here. Ayessa, there's only one man I love and he doesn't even know about the search. I'm sorry, but she doesn't want to. Madam. What do you want? You were supposed to go with your lord. It's about Karim. - Really ? - Yes ma'am. Come on. I feel we have many dangers ahead. I hope that at least one of us succeeds. Why not? I'm used to danger. the Great Allah, in his wisdom, already chosen one of us? - did you hear anything? - It's just the horses. They are restless. Let's get some rest, we have a long journey ahead. Water. That's the thief. It's Karim! And he has water! Thank you, Karim. you saved my life. Drink. Thank you. - I needed water. - Give some to others. This water will have to last until reach the next Oasis. And then where will we go? Anyone who wants to find the blue rose must go through the seven doors. The first door is on the east and can be seen where it is not. Very good. We are in the East. Where is the first door? Somebody tell me. At where? Look! Look! I see the door. It seems to be close, but it could be a day trip. It's just a mirage. Perhaps the first of the seven doors. She can be seen where she is not. Where are you going? Come back here! We need to get there before nightfall. Quickly. The first door! We will see. Help! Help! - What's going on? - The trees are moving! Help me. Help me. Hurry, let's get out of here! Help. The second door. I am Kadeejah. you faced many dangers to get to me. you are very brave. Welcome, Karim. - do you know my name? - Clear. Accept my hospitality and stay with me for a while. I am very grateful for your kindness. But I have to continue my journey. you could stay alone for the night. It is more important to continue my search. Don't worry, Karim. I know what you're thinking. No one will find the blue rose before you. How do you know? If you promise to stay with me until tomorrow, I'll let you see your princess. All right, I promise. My daughter, I bring you good news. Someone is here to see you. He was the first to come back, thanks to Allah. faced a thousand dangers, but my love for you helped me to overcome all obstacles. Amine. The blue rose. Osmar, you are the prince of princes. - you... - What does that mean? I'm a victim of black magic. you saw it yourself, the rose was blue. Yes, it was black magic. Sultan, for the last time, I ask you to keep your word with me. Bring the real blue rose, and I will keep my word. I will return to this palace, but I will return as lord of Baghdad! Karim. - I have to go. Before it's too late. - But you saw Amina. Remember your promise to stay with me until tomorrow? Tomorrow, I myself will reveal the secret of where the blue rose is hidden. believe me. And you need to trust me. Take our guest to your room and see if he is comfortable. Thank you. Hassam. Karim, in the world you left behind, friends become traitors and love turns to hate. But here everything is different, friends are true and love lasts forever. Why don't you stay here with me? I know you're leaving tomorrow, but just for tonight, let me believe you're not leaving . you are a beautiful woman, Kadeejah. If I stayed, I don't think I'd ever want to leave. - So you really need to leave? - Yes, I need. Karim. Would you like to make a toast? - To what, Kadeejah? - A toast to the love you denied me. If you really love me, I'll stay. Let's drink. - Both of us. - To a long life together, dear Karim. How dare you come see me, you idiot? I came again to offer my humble services. Your services... If it weren't for your services, I would have everything I came here to get! - you failed me! - Listen to me one more time, sir. - I promise you will be lord of Baghdad. - Speak! As you know, the sultan is a stubborn fool and will do anything to resist him now. So? If you take a loved one hostage, he may change his mind. The only person in this world the sultan loves: His daughter. I bring it to you. me go! Hurry up with it! Thank you. Wait. you! - Welcome, friend. - In the name of Allah, - Tell me who you are. - Soon you will know, Karim. you were the only one who overcame all the obstacles. I'm proud of you. But... did you see everything? Everything. you were deserving, Karim. I'm glad I helped a little bit. My son, here is the symbol of the my humble appreciation. A gem. This is a noble gift for a thief. Be careful! It's a magical gem. you will get what you want. Anything. But only once. Just a wish, Karim. I thank you from the bottom of my heart, glorious sir. Read it. Great Sultan of Baghdad, I, Prince Osmar, Ruler of the Land Between Two Rivers, I declare myself ruler of Baghdad, and I order you to open the gates of the city and do the honors due to me and my army. Bring her here! Amine. Your daughter will pay with her life if she puts up any resistance. Prince Osmar! There is a new law in Baghdad! Any man who takes a woman by force will be punished with 50 lashes. Enough! I'm going to teach you a lesson you won't forget! Get him! Put her back in my tent! Next! Next! Next! Twenty! 35! Here! Catch him and kill him! 36, 37, 38, 39, 40, 41. 42! 43, 44, 45... 46, 47, 48. 49... Fifty! It was all in vain. All in vain. The blue rose was destroyed. I don't believe Allah wants it that way. - Karim! - Karim! Karim. My princess, there is only one power in the world that can bring happiness to those who have lost her. It's love. If you love me, Amina, this is a blue rose. Yes, Karim. It's a blue rose. Father! Look! - Who is that old man? - Who? That one! I've seen him a lot recently. - See? - Yeah. He even gave me a piece of jewelry like his. That's impossible, boy! It's true, he helped me a lot. But you don't know what you say. This man has been dead for years. It was my uncle. The Great Sultan Araquém I, glory of my... Of our dynasty. END
