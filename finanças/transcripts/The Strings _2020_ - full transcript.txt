I already left, so... A week. I don't know, it was just simpler this way. I was trying to avoid... Yes, you essentially. Look, I can't really talk right now. I was just calling you as some kind of courtesy. Yeah, let's just talk later. 'Kay, bye. ♪ Oh ♪ ♪ Is a sin ♪ ♪ Oh ♪ ♪ Peeled all our skin off ♪ ♪ Does it show when my bone's exposed ♪ Fucking stop. Here we are. So an inertial reference frame is one where I guess Newtonian physics applies, it's a reference frame that is either staying still or is moving at a constant speed. Really, we're just not including accelerating reference frames. And I think this inertial reference frames is what makes special relativity special as opposed to general relativity, which you can deal with acceleration and likewise gravity. And to the speed of light and free space is the same in all inertial reference frames as well. Okay? So that speed of light is a constant when we're talking about inertial reference frames. Fuck. Fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck... fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck... Hi! I made it. - I'm alive. - Hi. Hi. The drive was pretty bad, honestly. Everyone was giving me shit about it before and I didn't believe them, but the storm was brutal. Speaking of brutal, did you talk to Derek? He was sending me messages, but I didn't write back. Ugh, sorry. Thanks. Yeah, I called him from Quebec. Uh, I was hoping to get his voicemail, honestly, but he picked up. We talked for like three seconds and then I dipped. Good call. Hey, pan me around. I want a tour. Hmm. I like your floor studio. Thank you. And as she brought the painting. You know it. Whose place is this again, your grandma's? Uh, no, it's my aunt's. Oh, cool. Yeah, there's a basement, too. Yeah, and...? Sorry, I just straight up don't remember there being a basement. I mean, that's pretty weird. Then again, I seem to forget way more important shit than that. True. That checks out. So how's it been going? It's been pretty good. I went to the beach this morning, which is really cool. The whole bay was, like, totally frozen over, which I didn't expect. That's cool. Getting any writing done, though? Um, it's okay. Getting this set up was good, but I don't know, it couldn't get much done today. My inbox is like a fucking distracting shitstorm for the ages. I bet... lots of changes. Yeah. I bet it will pick up once you start digging in a bit. I'm doing, um, a shoot with that girl, Grace, on Tuesday. Oh, is that the one who took the photos of you in Chinatown? Yeah, the haunted restaurant. She lives in Charlottetown now. - Cool. Those were sick - Yeah. I assume she'll probably want to take me to some equally fucked-up location out here. Correct me if I'm wrong, but didn't you say things got, like, a little flirty last time? I don't think I've ever said the word flirty to you in my life. I don't know. No, I don't know. I guess she was sweet and professional. Maybe I said I had a bit of a crush, but... Derek and I were still circling the drain or whatever at that point. Right. Gross. Easy there. It's cool. ♪ I didn't want ♪ ♪ And I don't know ♪ ♪ You anymore ♪ So, sparser? Kind of... less piano, I think. I don't know, we'll see. Can't wait to hear. Hopefully it shouldn't be too long. I want to get it out pretty quick. Kind of have to, actually. - How's the cottage? - It's good. Kind of weird to be back. So much more space than I'm used to. For sure. It's nice to get out and about today, though. Thanks for doing this. Where are we going to go next? Well, I've been wanting to shoot at this place, this empty farmhouse for forever... kind of been hoarding it. - Really? What's the deal? - Okay, well, let me look it up quick so I don't miss anything. I was supposed to memorize this last night to impress you, but I got a bit drunk. Me, too. All right, so in 1888, Annie Millman found her husband, James, drowned in a bathtub. At first they thought it was an accident, but later they ruled it as a homicide and arrested Annie; later, she confessed, saying she was hearing voices in her head. She asked for the death penalty, didn't get it, so she cut her wrists in jail. Apparently after that, nobody stayed in the house for very long until '71, when Joseph and Sue Welter moved in and began renovations. One day Joseph was working on the roof of the house and he threw his toolbox over the edge and it hit Sue in the head, killing her. And after that, he just vanished. Apparently, he was a really good swimmer, though, and used to swim at the beach every morning. So everybody says he just drowned himself in the ocean. - Shit, that's crazy. - Yeah. And the sister said a whole bunch of weird stuff was going on in the house. Anyways, it's been empty ever since. I didn't know you guys had stories like that out here. Pretty much all we got... that and potatoes. It's literally the exact same job I had when I was in high school. I'm hoping by the summer to have enough saved up to try Toronto again, but I don't know. It's not the worst here, really. Or maybe it is. I'm not too sure. Well, I mean, you have the ocean, right, so could definitely be worse. That is true. Think I'm almost ready to get back at it. How's my make up? You look great. ♪ I went wandering ♪ ♪ Wondering ♪ ♪ What it would bring ♪ And so here we have a Penrose diagram. This diamond contains the spacetime of the Universe, where the top and bottom corners signify infinite time, while the left and right represent infinite space, this boundary here, shared by the inverted triangle, is the event horizon. And up here at the top, this sawtooth edge is the singularity of our black hole. Yeah, it's sounding like we talked about it, - I think you'll dig it. - Great. How many tracks is it feeling like? Three most likely. Uh, there's definitely one that's standing out - more, though. - Perfect. Sounds like they want to put it out in April. Probably do a video for each? Cool. That sounds good. So could you manage a quick set for me? Mark's Lounge, Thursday night? I thought we agreed I'm not doing shows right now. - Yeah, no, we did... - It's January. No one's even going to be there. Look, I've known these guys a long time, you'd really be doing me a solid. You know, it'd just be great if for once things just went the way we planned. I'm tired of doing every last person fucking favor. Twenty five minutes. Yeah, that's fine. - Great. - All right, thanks. Yeah, well, I should probably go get back to it. Definitely. And don't forget the time difference out there as it applies to the interview tomorrow. Yeah, I got it. Also, just remember, I'm only talking about the new music, not the band hiatus and definitely not any of that Derek shit. Yeah, yeah... no, they know. It's cool. Our three-dimensional Universe is bound to a membrane which floats through a higher dimensional bulk. In this model, other brains each containing their own universe and reality are also moving through this hyperspace bulk. Interactions with other brains could influence our universe and introduce effects not possible in a more basic cosmological framework. Other string theory models postulate that these higher dimensions are compactified, right here in our Universe, within our known physical dimensions. Yeah, it's different sound, for sure. No more live drums, some guitar, maybe, but it's not what's driving the music anymore. For the first time, it's not a band, it's me. I don't mean to disregard or belittle anything that came before by saying that, but... I don't know... people change, you know, and so must the music. I want to be simpler, more direct. Yeah, well, it's winter, so, it's definitely... About death, more than birth or rebirth, I guess, but I think that's working. It's really kind of tragically beautiful here in the winter, so stark. I've been getting really into physics. You know, looking behind what's responsible for all this shit we take for granted. Trying to search those spaces for metaphor. I don't want to write lyrics about love or whatever bullshit anymore, you know? Uh... No plans regarding that. I thought we talked about this, I... Yeah, look, I... I know what they want. Trust me, I do, I'm not insulated. I do all this shit myself. I read the comments. Look, in the end, it doesn't matter if the new music is better, it just matters that it's the right music. Look, I'm really not interested in going into this. I'm sorry, I've got to put you on hold for a sec, okay? Bruce? You have one unheard message. Catherine, they, uh, just sent me a draft of the article, you call me back. ♪ Toxic ice, dirty ice ♪ ♪ Find me someone great ♪ ♪ Hard to taste when you wake ♪ ♪ But you long for something fake ♪ ♪ Ice that hurts, ice that burns ♪ ♪ Watch you dance and sway ♪ ♪ Through water lights on Monday nights ♪ ♪ Watch me walk away ♪ ♪ You say you don't sleep ♪ ♪ Anymore, I say I don't sleep ♪ ♪ Anymore, you say you won't keep ♪ ♪ Anymore, I say I won't keep ♪ ♪ Anymore ♪ ♪ Anymore ♪ ♪ White noise ♪ ♪ Is all that's left for me to fight, but it's ♪ ♪ It's all that gets me to sleep ♪ ♪ At night, so it's ♪ ♪ Won't tell you when to talk or use the right choice ♪ ♪ And white words are ♪ ♪ You say you don't sleep ♪ ♪ Anymore; I say I don't sleep ♪ ♪ Anymore; you say you won't keep ♪ ♪ Anymore; I say I won't keep ♪ ♪ Anymore; you say you don't sleep ♪ ♪ Anymore; I say I don't sleep ♪ ♪ Anymore; you say you won't keep ♪ ♪ Anymore; I say I won't keep ♪ ♪ Anymore ♪ ♪ Anymore ♪ ♪ Anymo-ore ♪ ♪ Anymore ♪ It's just two more nights...

Probably, but I don't know. I don't think that's it. Just need to get some sleep. - How's the music going? - I don't know. I've had some productive moments, but they've been kind of fleeting. Feel like all my distractions just followed me. Also, that interview was the worst. Shit. How was the show? Dead. Grace was there, though. We had some drinks. Well, that's something.

I've just been really busy this week. I took a quick look at them, though, and I didn't notice anything. - Oh, okay. - Why? What's up? Uh... Nothing, I'm probably just losing my shit. I don't know. I thought I could, like, see something in the photos, - and since then... - Really? Yeah. Since then, I can't really sleep. I keep on waking up and thinking I hear or see something, and... I don't know... in the morning, I guess I just feel stupid. Well, what have you seen? It's probably nothing... like, shapes and shadows, I guess. It's just that when you wake up in the middle of the night, it's like there's no... There is no context for anything. Anything seems possible. Yeah! It's like being in another reality, almost.

No. Yes. No. Yes. Yes. I will. Grace? Shit. Hey, you reached the voicemail of Grace. Leave your name and number and I'll get back to you as soon as I can. Bye! Grace? Grace. I've got you!
