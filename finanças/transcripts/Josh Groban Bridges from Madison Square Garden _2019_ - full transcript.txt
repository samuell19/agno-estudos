You were also thinking of my parents. was so thinking of your parents. Everybody who knows me will know that every pointf ght eventually goes back to my parents. But this song is about sticng iout. This song is about creating memories together that last a feme. Whenever I'm lucky enough to do this, I know you feel the same when you're on stage, we get to create these memories. It's like, blink and you miss it, and they go by so fast. So, I'm trying in my old age now, to take on these memories and to take a mental photograph. And be present. And be present. It's harder. Yeah. It's about being present with the one you love. And so, we're going to d thisong r yonow.

All right. I'm going to leave you with this one. It is a very strange time and it is a particular privilege to be in music ringheseimes because it's a time when we can remind each other through the arts, about our humanity about what makes us similar when everything around us is telling us how different we are and how much we should fear each other and hate each other. And New York is a city that's always understood that. So, thank you, New York, for being a beacon of light to the world with that message. And thank you for inviting us here in that spirit. It's been a privilege, it really has. We need more bridges and less walls. This is Bridge Over Troubled Water.
