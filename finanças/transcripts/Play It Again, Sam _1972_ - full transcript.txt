Hallo? Hallo? Radio tower? Lisbon plane taking off in ten minutes. East runway. Thank you. Hallo? Hallo? Radio tower? Lisbon plane taking off in ten minutes. East runway. Thank you. Hallo? Hallo? Radio tower? Lisbon plane taking off in ten minutes. East runway. Thank you. Certainly, Rick, anything you say. Find Mr Laszlo's luggage and put it on the plane. This way, please. You don't mind, you fill in the names. That'll make it even more official. You think of everything. And the names are Mr and Mrs Victor Laszlo. Why my name, Richard? Because you're getting on that plane. I don't understand. What about you? I'm staying until the plane gets away. No! What has happened? Last night - Last night we said a great many things. You said I was to do the thinking for both of us. I've done a lot of it and it adds up to one thing. You getting on that plane with Victor where you belong. You've got to listen to me. You have any idea what you'd have to look forward to if you stayed? Nine chances out of ten we'd both wind up in a concentration camp. Major Strasser would insist. You're saying this only to make me go. I'm saying it because it's true. We both know you belong with Victor. You're part of his work, the thing that keeps him going. If that plane leaves and you're not with him, you'll regret it. Maybe not today, maybe not tomorrow, but soon, and for the rest of your life. "But what about us?" "We'll always have Paris." "We didn't have, we'd lost it until you came to Casablanca." "We got it back last night." "I said I would never leave you." "And you never will." "I'm no good at being noble, but it doesn't take much to see that the problems of three little people don't amount to a hill of beans in this crazy world." Someday you'll understand that. Now, now. Here's looking at you, kid. "("AS TIME GOES BY" PLAYS)" "(MUSIC BECOMES DRAMATIC)" "(CAR HORN)" There's something you should know before you leave. I don't ask you to explain anything. I'm going to because it may make a difference later on. You said you know about Ilsa and me. Yes. "You didn't know she was at my place last night when you were." "She came there for the letters of transit. Isn't that true, Ilsa?" "Yes." "She tried everything to get them and nothing worked." "She did her best to convince me that she was still in love with me." "That was all over long ago." "For your sake she pretended it wasn't and I let her pretend." "I understand." "Here it is." "Thanks." "Are you ready, Ilsa?" "Yes, I'm ready." "Goodbye, Rick." "God bless you." Better hurry or you'll miss that plane. "Might be a good idea for you to disappear from Casablanca for a while." "There's a Free French garrison at Brazzaville." "I could be induced to arrange a passage." "My letter of transit? I could use a trip." "It doesn't make any difference about our bet, you still owe me 10,000 Francs." "That 10,000 Francs should pay our expenses." "Our expenses?" Louis, I think this is the beginning of a beautiful friendship. (TRIUMPHANT MUSIC) 'Who am I kidding?' 'I'm not like that.' 'I never was, I never will be.' 'That's strictly the movies.' I'm so depressed. Maybe if I took two more aspirin it would help. That would make... two, four, six aspirin. Turning into an aspirin junkie. Next I'll be boiling the cotton at the top of the bottle to get extra. 'I never should have signed these papers.' Let her take me to court. Two years of marriage down the drain like that. I couldn't believe what she said to me. She was like a stranger, not like my wife, like a total stranger. I don't want any alimony. You can have everything. I just want out. Can't we discuss it? We discussed it 50 times. It's no use. Why? I don't know. I can't stand the marriage. I don't find you any fun. I feel you suffocate me. I don't feel any rapport with you. I don't dig you physically. For God's sake, Allan, don't take it personal. I won't take it personal. I'll just kill myself, that's all. If only I knew where my damn analyst was vacationing. Where do they go every August? They leave the city. Every summer the city is full of people who are crazy till Labor Day. So what if I reach him? What's he going to tell me? No matter what I say, he tells me it's a sexual problem. Isn't that ridiculous? How can it be a sexual problem? We weren't even having relations. Maybe once in a while. She used to watch television during it. Change channels with the remote control switch. Why should a divorce bother me so? What the hell, maybe I'm better off without her. Why not? I'm young, I'm healthy, I've got a good job. This could be my chance to step out a little bit. If she can swing, so can I. I'll turn this place into a nightclub. I'll get broads up here like you wouldn't believe. Swingers, freaks, nymphomaniacs. Dental hygienists. She didn't want me, I'm not going to push myself on her. I couldn't believe what she said to me the day that she left. I want a new life. I want to go skiing, I want to go dancing. I want to go to the beach, I want to ride through Europe on a motorcycle. All we ever do is see movies. I write for a film magazine. Besides, I happen to like movies. You like movies because you're one of life's great watchers. I'm not like that. I'm a doer. I want to laugh, I want to participate. We never laugh together. How can you say that? I don't know about you, but I'm constantly laughing. I chuckle, I giggle, I guffaw occasionally. Why didn't this come up when we were dating? Things were different. You were more aggressive. Everybody is during courtship. It's natural. You're trying to impress the other person. You can't expect me to keep up that charm. I'd have a heart attack. Goodbye, Allan. My lawyer will call your lawyer. I don't have a lawyer. Have him call my doctor. What's the matter with me? Why can't I be cool? What's the secret? (MAN) There's no secret, kid. Dames are simple. I never met one that didn't understand a slap in the mouth or a slug from a .45. Yeah, because you're Bogart. I could never hit Nancy, it's not that type of relationship. Where'd you learn that word, from one of those head shrinkers? I'm not like you. In Casablanca when you lost Ingrid Bergman weren't you crushed? Nothing a little bourbon and soda wouldn't fix. I can't drink. My body will not tolerate alcohol. Take my advice and forget this fancy relationship stuff. The world is full of dames. All you've got to do is whistle. He's right. The world is full of dames. All you've got to do is whistle. The world is full of dames. All you've got to do is whistle. All you've got to do is whistle. He's right. "Nothing a little bourbon and soda couldn't fix." (DOOR BUZZER) Allan, are you alright? You poor thing. Why didn't you call as soon as she left? I didn't want to bother you. Not bother us? What are friends for? What reason did she give for wanting a divorce? She wants a laugh. She doesn't laugh enough. Insufficient laughter, that's grounds for divorce. And skiing. She wants to go skiing. She wants to ski down a mountain laughing like an idiot. Let me call my office and tell them where I am. I ran out of a business meeting. They must have thought I was crazy. Have you heard from her? I heard from Schulman and Weiss. They had me sign some papers and Nancy went to Mexico. Funny, we went to Mexico on our honeymoon. Spent the entire two weeks in bed. I had dysentery. Hello. George? Did they agree to the terms? Oh, hell. Well, if we blow it, we blow it. My God, can't you cook anything but TV dinners? Who bothers to cook 'em? I suck 'em frozen. Let me tell you where you can reach me. I'll be at 362-9296 for a while. Then I'll be at 648-0024 for about 15 minutes. Then I'll be at 752-0420 and then home at 621-4598. Yeah. Right, George. Bye-bye. There's a booth on the corner, you want me to run down and get the number? You'll be passing it. I'm sorry, Al. She wants to be a swinger. All of a sudden married life is no good for her. Don't get worked up. I gave her a home and affection and security. This was a little girl I found waiting tables at the Hip Bagel. I used to go in there every night and over-tip her. $1.50 on a 35 cent cheque. Allan, Nancy was impulsive, we all knew that. But she didn't leave impulsively. She talked about it for months. I just couldn't believe she'd go through with it. It's good you found out now. You're young, you can both make new lives. I'm 29. The height of my sexual potency was ten years ago. Oh, Allan, look at the bright side. You're free. You'll go out, there'll be girls, you'll go to parties. Have affairs with married women. Sexual relations with girls of every race, creed and colour. You get tired of that. Besides, those things never happen to me. I managed to fool one girl into loving me and now she's gone. You see how he downgrades himself? Don't you think there are plenty of women who would find him attractive? Hmm? Oh, yes, of course. The world is full of eligible women. But not like Nancy. She was a lovely thing. I used to lay in bed at night and watch her sleep. Once in a while she'd wake up and catch me. She'd let out a scream. He really loved her. I feel like crying. Why do you feel like crying? A man makes an investment, it doesn't pay off. Can I get an aspirin? I'm getting a headache. He's having a breakdown and you're getting sick. Don't get upset. I'm not, I just had a very rough day today. You want an aspirin, too? No. I ate all the aspirin. What about Darvon? That's OK. My analyst suggested Darvon when I had migraines. I used to get migraines, but my analyst cured me. Now I get cold sores. I still do. Ugly ones from tension. I don't think analysis can help me. I need a lobotomy. With mine on vacation I feel paralysed. You should get married and move into a hospital. You want a fresco with the Darvon? Unless you have apple juice. Apple juice and Darvon is fantastic together. Have you ever had Lithium and tomato juice? I haven't, but another neurotic tells me they're unbelievable. Could I get a Coke with nothing in it? I'll get the pills. Have you ever had Lithium and tomato juice? I haven't, but another neurotic tells me they're unbelievable. Have you ever had Lithium and tomato juice? I haven't, but another neurotic tells me they're unbelievable. Could I get a Coke with nothing in it? Could I get a Coke with nothing in it? I'll get the pills. I'll get the pills. He never should have married Nancy. He never mentioned anything. I thought they were getting along. It's because you're so busy you never see what's going on. Didn't you think it was strange that he was married and yet couldn't get a date on New year's Eve? OK, don't get overwrought. Hello, this is Mr Christie. I'm no longer at 752-0420. I'm going to be home at 621-4598. What? Yes, I'll hold on. These things upset me. I'm experiencing a wave of insecurity. You're experiencing a wave of insecurity? I'll tell you what happened to me. I bought 100 acres of land in Florida. Turns out 98 of them have quicksand. My syndicate wanted to build a golf course. Now what? The only thing we can do is to build a three-hole course with the biggest sand trap in the world. What are you taking a pill for? I'm tense. Why? The whole subject of divorce is traumatic for me. But he's getting divorced, not us. It's the idea of it. I guess I've never gotten over my parents' divorce. It's about time. Come here. You're so insecure. I wish I could - Hello, Dick. That deal is unacceptable. The figures are lousy. I can't take it in that form. Marjorie, did Mr Hardy call? I'm at 922-3299. I'll be - I'm picking my wife up. What? Who? Allan Felix. Alright, I'll call him later. Bye-bye. Allan's calling again. We got to find him a girl. Someone he can be with and get excited about. Well, find a nice girl for him. There must be somebody. Not many single ones. What about Carol? Engaged. What about her? Doreen? She's living with a priest. How about the tall one with blonde hair? Sarita for Allan? My God, she'd eat him alive. There'd be nothing left but his glasses. I think this is going to be a little bit of a problem. Mr Christie, there's a call for you. Yes? I've got a great idea. Linda and I are going out for dinner tonight. We'll invite some nice girl and the four of us will go together. No. You've got to get out and start meeting girls. I haven't looked at another woman in two years. I'm out of practise. When I was in practise I was out of practise. You've invested your emotions in a losing stock. It was wiped out. It dropped off. What do you do? You reinvest. Maybe in a more stable stock. Something with long-term growth possibilities. Who are you going to fix me up with, General Motors? Come on, shape up. A pretty girl. She'd have to be damn good to do anything for my morale. Who can we get for him? You don't even have anybody in mind? We have several people. What kind do you like? He likes neurotics. I like blondes. Little blondes with long hair and short skirts and boots and big chests and bright and witty and perceptive. Don't set yourself ridiculous standards. She must be beautiful with long hair and a big bust? And a good behind, something I can sink my teeth into. He was always very fussy. Right, but look at the result. Right, you never went out. Sally Keller has long hair and a good-sized chest. What's good size? I don't know, like this, I guess. She's not the brightest girl. What does she do? She works for an astrologer. Forget it. Come on, you might even get her into bed. With my luck I won't be able to get her into a chair. The girls with the looks that you want don't have great minds. I don't know why we're making so much fuss over dinner companionship. I don't even want that, I can't go out. I'm still attached to Nancy. Will you forget about Nancy? She's gone. That's true. She wanted to be free so she could swing. Come on, darling, think of somebody. I don't even want that, I can't go out. I'm still attached to Nancy. Will you forget about Nancy? She's gone. I don't even want that, I can't go out. I'm still attached to Nancy. Will you forget about Nancy? She's gone. That's true. Will you forget about Nancy? She's gone. That's true. She wanted to be free so she could swing. Oh, baby, this is wonderful. My ex-husband would never take me on a motorcycle. He fell off a scooter once and broke his collarbone. I don't mean a motor scooter either, I mean the kind you push with your foot. Movies, that's his whole life. He's a watcher. I'm a doer. It's been so long since I've been made love to by a tall, strong, handsome, blue-eyed, blond man. We're divorced two weeks, she's dating a Nazi. Hey, what about Sharon? Yeah, what about Sharon? I like the name. Sharon works for Jack, the photographer. She's his assistant. She's a bright girl and very cute. Let's go. Call her. Perfect. What are you going to tell her? I'm going to see if she's free for dinner. Don't mention the divorce. Tell her my wife's dead. Leave it to us. I don't know if we should go through with this. Tension's beginning to set in. My stomach is jumping. Sharon, please. Linda Christie. I don't want to hear this. Hi, Sharon? It's Linda. How are you? Fine. (ALLAN HUMS NOISILY) Dick and I are going to dinner tonight with an old friend and we thought you might want to join us. Huh? No, that's nothing. We just have the radio on. Allan Felix. No, you don't know him. A writer, a widower. Tell her my wife died in a mine shaft explosion. He's lots of fun. I think you'll like him. If she doesn't want to do it, forget it. I don't need this aggravation. We'll pick you up with the car, 8 o'clock. Simple dress. Sure. Flats are OK. Let her wear heels. What am I, Toulouse Lautrec? OK, bye-bye. You're set. I really have mixed feelings about this. What if I have this chick in bed and Nancy comes back? Let's not hope for too much this first night. Did she say anything about me? What could she say? She doesn't know you. You never said I was a widower. I got you the date. You tell her the part about your wife's death. I'm excited about this. We'll pick Sharon up first, she lives near us. We'll get you at 8:10pm. I can't stay out late. I've got to get up early. We can eat at the Pier at Sausalito. It's a perfect night to dine out. Wonderful, it's so romantic. The food is terrible there. Besides, I think it's gonna rain. You gonna be alright? I'll be fine. I'll shower and douse my body with Canoe. I'm going home. Today I'm going to brush all my teeth. I think he and Sharon ought to hit it off, don't you? Yeah? You don't think so? He'll probably calm down by tonight. I wish she'd seen me before. I hate to be there on a blind date when a girl first sets eyes on me. What if she's disappointed and laughs or screams? Ridiculous. Has a girl ever once reacted by laughing or screaming? Once. A little co-ed from Brooklyn College. Came to the door, saw me and passed out. She was weak from dieting, though. What the hell? Bogart was short. That never seemed to bother anybody. You're starting off on the wrong foot, kid. Negative, you mean. Sure. You're letting her get the best of you before the game even starts. What's that stuff you was putting on your face? That's Canoe, an aftershave lotion. What about all that other stuff? That's Lavoris, Mennen spray deodorant and Johnson Johnson baby powder. For Christ's sake, you're gonna smell like a French cat house. I need them. Why, you ashamed to sweat? I want to make an impression. You know, kid, somewheres in life you got turned around. It's her job to smell nice for you. Whatever you do, don't tell her you don't drink, she'll think you're a boy scout. And don't get nervous. You know, kid, somewheres in life you got turned around. It's her job to smell nice for you. You know, kid, somewheres in life you got turned around. It's her job to smell nice for you. Whatever you do, don't tell her you don't drink, It's her job to smell nice for you. Whatever you do, don't tell her you don't drink, she'll think you're a boy scout. And don't get nervous. You know he's right. A lot of women are turned on by a masculine, earthy quality. Shouldn't have put so much Binoca under my arms. Wouldn't it be great if Sharon and I hit it off at first sight? (IMPERSONATES BOGART) Why not? They say that dames are simple. I never met one who didn't understand a slap in the mouth or a slug from a .45. Come here, Sharon. Oh, Allan. You are fantastic. Up until tonight the doctors had told me that I was frigid. Oh, I want to thank you for proving them wrong. You got any girlfriends with the same problem, bring them over. When Dick and Linda spoke of you they used terms like "brilliant" and "genius". But they didn't say that you were also an animal. Sorry I had to slap you around, sweetheart. But you got hysterical when I said "no more". Oh, Allan. Oh, Allan. (DOOR BUZZER) Yes? It's Linda. Linda? Yes. I'm alone. Sharon's with Dick. They're parking. He sent me ahead to make sure everything's OK. Everything's fine. I didn't realise it was so late. What did you do, break a bottle of shaving lotion? I'm wearing too much? It's a touch strong. Not terrible. Once we get out you won't even notice. I better set this place up quickly. The place is fine. We're just going to have a quick drink and go. A few carefully placed objects will create the proper impression. You're not going to leave half-open books lying around like you're reading them? It creates an image. You don't need an image. Got just the thing. My 100 yard dash medal. You're not going to leave out a track medal. Why not? I paid $20 for it. I've got a big decision to make. Do I go with Oscar Peterson or Bartok String Quartet No 5? Why don't you play Oscar Peterson and leave Bartok out so everybody can see it? That's a good idea. I've never seen anybody go to so much trouble to impress a date, particularly such a casual date. If you devoted this much time with Nancy I don't see why she left you. I did. I used to write her poems and take her to candlelit restaurants and order in French. The waiter would bring all the wrong things. Maybe if you just leaned across the candlelight and kissed her. I tried. She used to say, "Christ, not here, everybody's staring." Once in a little bistro on Union Street my sleeve caught fire. You laughed, it's funny, right? She took it as a symbol of my clumsiness, which I guess it was. (DOOR BUZZER) Tremendous poise. I'm an absolute master. (JAZZ PIANO MUSIC) Come on in. Allan. This is Sharon. Hello. (GRUNTS) I was just telling Dick I've got friends on this block in the house across the street. You know the Gibsons? No. Hal and Elinor Gibson, they're a fantastic couple. He's an interior decorator. Really? That's sort of a hobby of mine. Oh. The key to interior decorating is to avoid looking like you used a decorator. I've got to make one quick call. Linda, are you wearing Jasmine? Me? No. What are we drinking? I'll have a J&B on the rocks. I'll have a Harveys Bristol Cream, please. I'll have the usual. Bourbon and water. Oh, a Bourbon man. I've got to cut down on my drinking. I'm putting away a quart a day. I'll have the usual. Bourbon and water. Oh, a Bourbon man. I'll have the usual. Bourbon and water. Oh, a Bourbon man. I've got to cut down on my drinking. I'm putting away a quart a day. Bourbon and water. Oh, a Bourbon man. I've got to cut down on my drinking. I'm putting away a quart a day. I've got to cut down on my drinking. I'm putting away a quart a day. This is Mr Christie. I'm no longer at 431-5997. I'm going to be at Mr Fe- What time did that come in? Yeah. Sharon did a movie. Oh? Underground. Stag film? Underground, very arty, 16mm. Allan is interested in cinema. Really? What do you do? I'm a writer. Nothing much. Film Weekly. Articles, essays, criticism. This film I did got very good reviews. As a matter of fact, I got singled out. I was the only girl in it with nine men. Really? What was it called? Maybe I saw it. Gang-bang. You know these films have the raunchiest titles. Really it wasn't a bit sexy. You were all out of Bourbon so I made it straight water. It's so humid out, I think it's going to rain. Maybe that's why I've got this headache. I get terrible sinus attacks. You should have them drained. That's why it's silly to go to the Pier. Do you think you could turn the music down a little bit? Of course. What's the point of going to an outdoor restaurant in the rain? You used to like to take me walking in the rain. I love the rain. It washes memories off the sidewalk of life. (RECORD SCRATCHES LOUDLY) Gee, Allan, you really have the delicate touch. Allan is a trifle tense. He had a little misfortune with his wife. Dick... His wife? Well, his ex-wife. She's gone. She's dead. How awful. Well, she's not really dead. Technically not dead, but we're not dating. She left him. I'm sorry. Well... Is he on anything? He's been under some strain lately. This is Mr Christie. I'm at the Hong Fat Noodle Company. That's 824-7996. Yeah, right. OK, bye-bye. Let me tell you what's really interesting. When they eat rice with chopsticks authentically, they bring it up to their mouth like this and it's a shovelling move that you get with your arm. Just sort of... What's the matter? Would you excuse me a second? I'll be right back. She likes me. What? I can read women. She wants me to come on with her. She digs me. She's playing it very coolly. I'm going to come on with her later. Well, good night. Thanks for dinner. It's only 10 o'clock. I've got this headache and I've got to get up early. I'll walk you upstairs. That's OK. No, no, honey. This city's a jungle. I better go. I'm not down in an hour, sub-let my apartment. You know any other girls? I don't know if any of my friends are his type. Most the girls I know are fairly normal. He's just over anxious, that's all. As soon as she came over he went into his act. Well, good night. You know, Sharon, a dame like you and a guy like... How did it go with Sharon? Really? I keep striking out with women and you keep laughing. Everybody's insecure, not just you. No, you're wrong, Dick is. Me? Are you kidding? Ask my analyst. I keep striking out with women and you keep laughing. Everybody's insecure, not just you. I keep striking out with women and you keep laughing. Everybody's insecure, not just you. No, you're wrong, Dick is. Me? Are you kidding? Ask my analyst. No, you're wrong, Dick is. Emotionally disturbed women are interesting. Maybe a nice pervert or something. Jennifer? What do you mean, crazy? It will strictly be sex. She's too weird to have a relationship with. I don't mind just sex. That would be great. I prefer a girl who doesn't get hung up on me. I definitely think we should try it. I really appreciate this. I know it must be a drag for you. You know who's not insecure? Bogart. That's not real life. You set too high a standard. If you're gonna identify, who am I gonna pick? My rabbi? Bogart's a perfect image. "You don't have to pick anybody, you're you." I know that you can't believe that. Anyway, onward to Jennifer. (WHISTLES) (COUGHS) Allan, I won't deny it. I'm a nymphomaniac. I discovered sex very early. I slept with everybody. My school teacher, my sister's husband, the string section of the New York Philharmonic. I want to have sex all the time, play all the time. Otherwise you're just down. Why be down? The best way to get up is sex. I'm not like my sisters. They're so inhibited. They never want to do anything. I believe in having sex as often, as freely and as intensely as possible. (SCREAMS) What do you take me for? 'How did I misread those signs?' This stuff just knocks me out. Do you realise we're in a room that holds some of the highest achievements of Western civilisation? There's no girls. Oh, look at that Rouault. It's pretty. Yeah. If you could have any painting, what would you pick? A Van Gogh. Any Van Gogh. Me too. I feel some sort of mystical attraction for Van Gogh. Why is that? I don't know. I just know he was a great painter and cut off his ear for a girl. That's the kind of thing you'd do for a girl. I'd have to like her a lot. I wonder if Dick would cut his ear off for me. I don't think you would ask him. He's been very busy lately. Must be fantastic to be loved so intensely. Why don't we split and see if there's any action at the Berkeley museum? This is ridiculous. Hey, there's one. She's great. Go ahead, speak to her. No. You kidding? Go on before the room gets - Go on, give it a try. What am I gonna say? That's what we're here for. Go on. Casual, casual. That's quite a lovely Jackson Pollock, isn't it? Yes, it is. What does it say to you? It restates the negativeness of the universe, the hideous lonely emptiness of existence. Nothingness, the predicament of man forced to live in a barren, godless eternity like a tiny flame flickering in an immense void with nothing but waste, horror and degradation forming a useless, bleak straitjacket in a black, absurd cosmos. What are you doing Saturday night? Committing suicide. What about Friday night? If they're beautiful, they're crazy. Great beauty drives a woman crazy. What's he ranting about? What about Friday night? What about Friday night? If they're beautiful, they're crazy. Great beauty drives a woman crazy. If they're beautiful, they're crazy. Great beauty drives a woman crazy. What's he ranting about? If they're beautiful, they're crazy. Great beauty drives a woman crazy. I'm red-headed, I'm fair-skinned. I don't tan, I stroke. A lot of good women go to the beach at weekends. Secretaries, receptionists. I want a really great woman. Look, Madame Curie's dead, who else is there? I thought you were too busy to go away on the weekend. A few guys from the office will be there. I've got meetings lined up. Do you think we'll get to see you? I've got you pencilled in for dinner. Very funny. Are there spiders at the beach? Come on! Anything with more than two legs that walks across my chest kills me. We've got to find him a broad. That's for sure. We've got to find him some broad. I'm carsick. Come on, we're going to drop you in the bay. Hello, this is Mr Christie. I'm no longer at 731-0711. I'll be at 885-0714. That's good for the whole weekend. It's a terrific beach house. I'm glad you like it. Let's burn it down for the insurance. There's a single bed in here! What happens if I get lucky? You make love on the beach. On the beach? Yeah. I'll be making love in the sand, the tide will come in and carry me off and I'll score and drown at the same time. Look at that. That is pretty. Look out there. Oh, yeah. That's really beautiful. The fog's going to creep in. Look, you can see the seagulls flying over the cesspool. (FUNK MUSIC) Hey, this is fun. I haven't been to a place like this in such a long time. I'm getting a heart attack. I can't believe that girl. It's 392-8098. She's a doll. I would sell my mother to the Arabs for her. Why don't you ask her to dance? You've been staring for an hour. I can't, I don't know her. I can't stay much longer. I've got to get up early to play tennis with guys from the office. You want one dance, honey? We can't do those dances. You have to be under 16 to look good. I love you, miss, whoever you are. I want to have your child. Alright, get up and do it. No, I can't dance. Come on. I'm scared. I had measles as a child. My body won't function. Come on, Allan, go. Now start dancing. Ready? I'll keep count. One, two. One, two. Right, now go and say something to her. One, two. One, two. One, two. Allan, try something more meaningful. Three, four, three, four. Speak to her, Allan. You interested in dancing at all? Get lost, creep. What did she say? She'd rather not. Even if we buy two more lots we're going to have to wait to build. It's still cheaper to hold on to them. It's not going to stay at these prices. It will require a loan and to use our current holdings as collateral. Don't you understand? You've got a lot going for you. You're bright and funny and even romantic if you'd only believe it. I don't see why you put on a false mask when you meet a girl. Will we be able to build, even in the new tax year? What's the point of building if the interest rate might go down? I keep saying, just be yourself, a girl will fall in love with you. I don't see why you put on a false mask when you meet a girl. Will we be able to build, even in the new tax year? I don't see why you put on a false mask when you meet a girl. Will we be able to build, even in the new tax year? What's the point of building if the interest rate might go down? Will we be able to build, even in the new tax year? What's the point of building if the interest rate might go down? I keep saying, just be yourself, a girl will fall in love with you. It will make a big difference if you're going to pay $600. It's a great opportunity. The new tax year you may have half a per cent more interest rate. I got you a present because I know it's your birthday. How do you know? You mentioned the date and I remembered it because it's the same date my mother had her hysterectomy. Oh, Allan. It's lovely. It's beautiful. A plastic skunk. It looked so cute and I heard you say skunks are your favourite animal. I'm so touched I don't know what to say. Do you like it? I love it. It doesn't do anything, it's just a skunk. I think she liked your present better than mine. I'm serious. She usually gets excited when I get her something. All she could talk about was her skunk. It's your imagination. I don't know. She's moody lately. Because you neglect her. I know I neglect her. Did she say something? She doesn't have to. I see the two of you together. Yeah? Plus she said something. Probably nothing we haven't been through. She's a very insecure girl. She needs attention. What has she got to be insecure about? I'm crazy about her. Because I'm too busy at this particular time to dote on her? You have to understand, she's used to being fussed over. She's very pretty, high marks in college. I sometimes think she married me because I didn't fawn over her. Not that I don't want to. You must admit you're driven. You know what's happening with the stock market? Read the papers. Where are we going? There she is. She works at my office. I met her here yesterday. She just broke up with her boyfriend. There's too many people at the table. Doesn't make a difference. I don't think I want to. We'll do it later. What do you want me to say? Ask her to dinner. I can't ask her to dinner. Why can't you and Linda come? Because I have to work tonight. Julie, this is Allan Felix. Would you like to go to dinner this evening? That's right to the point. That was pretty fast. Forgive me... They needed tossing anyhow. Hey, let's go in there and get stoned and watch the freaks. You sure you don't want to go to the movies? There's an Eric von Stroheim festival. Come on! Want to dance? No, thanks. Didn't ask you, I asked her. I don't want to dance either. The hell is this? It's 7Up. On the waggon, doctor's orders. My hand shakes. It's like battle fatigue. This guy kills me. What's your name, honey? Julie. Julie? It's a nice name, Julie. Got to get the kid back to the orphanage. I take her out once a year to the zoo and the circus. Excuse me now. Sit down. I'd love to stay, but I've got to be up early tomorrow. Going to Temple. It's my people's Sabbath. Chris. Chris is coming over, is he? I want you to meet this good looking broad. Thanks for inviting us over. Just get right in here. I love parties. You'd look real good on the back of my chopper. You fellas seen the new production of The Trojan Women? They're perfect. What are you doing? Financial reports. Which are not fun. Have you seen Allan around lately? No. Oh, he was here before. He's out tonight. On a date? Yes, I fixed him up. You did? Mm-hmm. Who with? One of the girls at the office. He's out tonight. On a date? Yes, I fixed him up. You did? Mm-hmm. Who with? One of the girls at the office. You did? Mm-hmm. Who with? One of the girls at the office. Who with? One of the girls at the office. Is Julie the blonde one with big eyes? Blonde, big eyes, very earthy. Always wears tight clothes with see-through blouses. Every guy in the office has a thing for her. You think she's right for Allan? Mm-hmm. Because to me she doesn't seem like the type. No, he liked her. Really? Yes. How do you know? I could feel it. Did he say anything? Hey, I'm trying to work. OK, I'm sorry. Those guys are following us. Don't worry, I'm a fast runner. Where are you going with that chick? Don't look back, I don't have my Bible. I'm scared. I'm gonna go into my fake limp. Let's all go on a little party. Fellas, I'm a veteran. Why don't you get rid of this creep? I'll take you for a ride on my chopper. Take your hands off her. Did I say that? Alright, shorty. Your tattoo's coming off on my neck. I'm going to start screaming. Don't worry, sweetheart, I can handle this. Start screaming. Allan, is that you? Yes. How did it go, fella? I got into a fight. What? You got into a fight? With who? Some guys were getting tough with Julie. Had to teach them a lesson. Are you alright? I'm fine. I snapped my chin down onto some guy's fist and hit another one in the knee with my nose. Where's Julie? She ran off with the leader. They're getting married. They're heading for Mexico. It never would have worked with Julie. She's Protestant and I'm Catholic and there's a great religious abyss. Who were these guys? They said they were hairdressers. (LAUGHS) Hard to believe, though. You want us to call a doctor? No, I'm fine. I could use a three-foot band-aid until the pain subsides. She's laughing and my sex life is turning into the Petrified Forest. Very funny. 'Ten million women in the country and I can't wind up with one.' 'Come on, you had some laughs with Linda.' 'Yeah, with Linda, there's no pressure with Linda.' 'I'm not trying to make her.' 'I'm sure if I met her on a date we wouldn't have any fun at all.' 'It's the girls I try to score with I can't get to first base with.' I'm turning into the strike-out king of San Francisco. Allan, what do you expect? Didn't I always say you're not the romantic type? What's the matter with me, Nancy? You're a dreamer. You're awkward, you're clumsy. They can see how desperate you are. You know this, you said it yourself. Don't go by that girl tonight, she was nothing. I was toying with her. Face it, you may be very sweet, but you're not sexy. Don't be so sure. You never said that when we were married. I was thinking it. I bet she was. I wonder if she actually had an orgasm in the two years we were married or did she fake it that night? I bet she was. I wonder if she actually had an orgasm I bet she was. I wonder if she actually had an orgasm in the two years we were married or did she fake it that night? I wonder if she actually had an orgasm in the two years we were married or did she fake it that night? in the two years we were married or did she fake it that night? Allan Felix, an old friend of hers from high school. I dated her once. Do you remember? I'm stunned. It was 11 years ago. That's right. Short with red hair and glasses. Yes. No, that's cleared up. Well, how can I get in touch with her? Really? She still feels that way? It's been 11 years. When did you last speak with her? Yes? Last week, huh? And she specified that she didn't want you to give me the number? I see. OK, thank you. Yes. OK. Excuse me, could you tell me where Mr Felix is? Right through that door. He's in the projection room. Thank you. Allan? Are you busy? What are you doing here? I don't feel so hot. What's the matter? What do you have for an anxiety attack? I need a tranquilliser. I'm a drug store. What's wrong? I have this throbbing in the pit of my stomach. How do you know it's anxiety and not fear? My stomach feels jumpy. Do you find it hard to breathe? I feel frightened and I don't know what over. I get that. What is it? Fear or anxiety? Homosexual panic. I always get this way when Dick goes on a business trip. He had to fly to Cleveland. I got up, helped him pack, drove him to the airport and threw up in the United Airlines terminal. It's a good terminal, I've thrown up there. I don't know what it is that upsets me. Fear of separation. An interesting psychological phenomenon. I had to go to Washington once. Even though I was the one leaving, I got sick. When I returned, my wife threw up. My analyst would say I'm feeling guilty because I want him to go. That's funny, I can't understand you. You're such a knockout. Why are you such a mass of symptoms? Why is anybody screwed up? I guess it happens when you're a child. You think you're ugly. Your parents get divorced, you feel abandoned. You must have the same sort of thing. My parents never got divorced, although I begged them to. I know you think I'm real nice and I appreciate it. It's good for my ego. I do, and I'm hyper critical. I have a tendency to reject before I get rejected. That way I save a lot of time and money. Hey, no date tonight? I had a date with a girl but she called it off. Some kind of Polish holiday. Why don't we go out to dinner and maybe hit a movie? OK. I have a better idea. Why don't we have dinner at my house because The Late Show is showing The Big Sleep tonight. You have anything for me to cook? I have frozen steaks and a bottle of champagne left. What are you doing with champagne? Launch a ship? I tried to cook at home to impress a girl. I tried to make beef stroganoff. How did it taste? It's still on the wall. I'll buy some stuff and bring it over and fix it. That would be fabulous. I'll get some asparagus and salad and desert. I love to cook but I never get a chance. Dick's so busy. Great. Get a whole lot of stuff. You can open the champagne, but not if I'm the only one who'll drink it. I'll have one or two, but you have to put me to bed if I dance naked. It's going to be great. I've got a terrific rapport with Linda. I hate to see her depressed. It'll be real nice, a nice cosy evening in. Build a little fire. Get some candles at the store, set up some atmosphere. We can open a bottle of champagne. Women are such suckers for champagne, it makes them crazy. Makes them crazy. Wait a minute, what am I talking about? This is Linda, Dick's wife. (BOGART) So, you finally fell in love with her, eh? I just got carried away. Come on, kid, you don't have to feel guilty. Guilty over what? Two lonely people with a tremendous amount in common have dinner together. We're platonic friends. There's nothing platonic about the way she thinks of you. How can you tell? What do you want her to do? Attack you? Guilty over what? Two lonely people with a tremendous amount in common have dinner together. We're platonic friends. Guilty over what? Two lonely people with a tremendous amount in common have dinner together. We're platonic friends. There's nothing platonic about the way she thinks of you. have dinner together. We're platonic friends. There's nothing platonic about the way she thinks of you. How can you tell? What do you want her to do? Attack you? There's nothing platonic about the way she thinks of you. How can you tell? What do you want her to do? Attack you? She loves you, not him. He's not the romantic type. He could be if he tried. Don't listen to him. Don't listen to her. We're in a supermarket. Get a grip on yourself. She's married. And to your best friend. They're never going to get a divorce either. Why can't I ever get a break? 'I'd like you to do me a favour.' I've fallen in love with another woman. Don't ask me how, it just happened. We're going off to Alaska together. She's an Eskimo. You and Linda have always been fond of one another. I thought while I'm gone you'll look after her. Of course. Well, I'm off to Alaska. If you need me, I'll be at frozen tundra 6-9290. I'm so tense. I don't know what's wrong. She'll be here any second. She is always complimenting me. I know she likes me. But does she like me that way? What the hell, I could test her. Linda, my darling. I could make an advance. What could possibly go wrong? Linda, my darling. Allan, don't. It was meant to be. Take your hands off me, you must be crazy. Linda, my love. Allan, I'm a married woman. Rape! Let's not get carried away. I'm not an appealing guy. I thought that a girl like Linda could fall for me? I'm kidding myself. Where the hell is she anyhow? By now she could have had her goddamn steak and been out of here. (DOOR BUZZER) I feel so light. That Librium I took is really beginning to work. Look, maybe you'd better not have any champagne. What the hell? If I get carried away you can always call the police. How long did you say Dick was out of town for? He'll be back tomorrow. There's a new Truffaut film at the Regency. You're kidding? We're all set. Besides, it's starting to rain. I just remembered, that great Ida Lupino movie's on Channel 4. The one where she's happily married and suddenly becomes involved with her husband's best friend. How does it end? She kills them and herself. Let's go out. I really want to see that movie. It's a fascinating theme. Do you think it's possible to love two people at once? What do you mean? A wife happily married suddenly finds out she loves another man. Not that she doesn't love her husband, just that she loves somebody else. Do you think that's very possible? Do you? Very. Very possible and probably very common. Love is such a strange phenomenon. Strange and exquisite. > Go ahead, make your move. No, I can't. Go ahead, take her and kiss her. Is anything wrong? Go ahead, she wants it. Hurry, before she moves out of position. Kiss her, kid. I guess I'd better be doing the potatoes. Well, kid, you blew it. I can't do it. How does it look? I invite her over and come on like a sex degenerate. What am I, a rapist? You're getting carried away. You think too much. Just do it. We're platonic friends. I can't spoil that. She'll slap my face. I've had my face slapped plenty of times. But your glasses don't go flying across the room. You're going to disappoint her, kid. I can't. Here we are. You can start on this. Did you read in the papers another Oakland woman was raped? I was nowhere near Oakland. Do they know who did it? They haven't a clue. Must be very clever. You've got to have something to rape so many women and get away with it. If anybody tried to rape me I'd pretend to go along with it, then grab the nearest heavy object and let him have it. That is unless of course I was enjoying it. They say it's a secret desire of every woman. I guess that depends on who's doing the raping. then grab the nearest heavy object and let him have it. That is unless of course I was enjoying it. That is unless of course I was enjoying it. That is unless of course I was enjoying it. They say it's a secret desire of every woman. They say it's a secret desire of every woman. I guess that depends on who's doing the raping. They say it's a secret desire of every woman. I guess that depends on who's doing the raping. Oh, I feel so light. That drink is going right to my head. I'm floating. Go ahead, kiss her. I can't. She's ready. How can you be sure? Believe me, I'm sure. She'll pull back. She's sitting and waiting. Now don't screw up. I'm gonna try, but I'm gonna go slow. If she screams, I'll pretend it was a joke. Hurry up. She better laugh. (PHONE RINGS) Hello? Dick? Yes, she's here. She came over before. I was going out. I had a Polish date. It's for you. It's from Cleveland. It's Dick. Are you upset? I was startled by the ring. I want her out, I can't handle this. I'll cause an international incident. Hello, darling. She loves him. Why am I kidding myself? Will you relax? You're as nervous as Lizabeth Scott was before I blew her brains out. All you got to do is make your move and you're home free. This is crazy. We're going to wind up on the front page of the National Enquirer. OK. Goodbye. Yes, I will. Dick sounded a little down. I think he's having trouble in Cleveland. How come he never takes you with him when he goes on out-of-town trips? I'm afraid to fly. My analyst says it's an excuse. He never asks me along, though. Who knows, maybe he's got something going on the side. Would that bother you? Sure, not if I didn't know. So it would hurt Dick a lot if you ever had a casual affair with anybody else? I don't think I could have a casual affair. No? I don't take those things lightly. If I felt for another man there'd have to be something more there than just a fling. I'd have to feel something more serious, in - Are you shaking? Chilly. Just chilly. It's not very cold. Anyway, I'm not the type for an affair. I don't think I could take the excitement involved. Besides, I'm not glamorous enough. You're uncommonly beautiful. When I go out with you and all those beautiful young girls I feel as though life has passed me by. I should be selling chocolates at Fannie Farmer. Those girls are not in your league. Keep talking, you're saving my life. I have such an inferiority complex. You're handling yourself very well. Now kiss her. Please. You built up to it beautifully. I don't have the nerve. Tell her how beautiful she is. I just told her. Again. You really are an unusually beautiful person. I don't know what to say. You are exceptionally beautiful. You're a very beautiful girl. You're uncommonly beautiful. You're unusually beauti- Alright already! It's been so long since anybody's said that to me. Now move closer to her. How close? The length of your lips. That's very close. Come on, move. Now what? Now tell her that she moves something in you that you can't control. You're kidding. Go ahead. From me it's corny. She'll love it. Fred Astaire looks great in tails, I look lousy. Leave Fred Astaire out of this and say something. I love the time we've spent together. So have I. Was that alright? I don't want to use your other line - You're doing fine, kid. Now tell her she has the most irresistible eyes you've ever seen. You have the most eyes I've ever seen on any person. Your eyes - Allan, your hand is trembling. That's because you're near. Pardon me? Tell her that. That's because you're near. You really know what to say, don't you? Now, tell her that you've met a lot of dames, but she is really something special. That she wouldn't believe. Oh, no? I have met a lot of dames, but you are really something special. Really? She bought it. but she is really something special. That she wouldn't believe. Oh, no? Oh, no? I have met a lot of dames, but you are really something special. I have met a lot of dames, but you are really something special. Really? She bought it. I have met a lot of dames, but you are really something special. That I can't do. Go on! I'll try. Now, get ready for the big move and do exactly as I tell you. I warned you to leave my ex-husband alone. Well, I guess I better fix the steaks. Linda. Hmm? Your eyes... are like two thick steaks. Allan, don't. I'll pay for the lamp. I think I love you. No, I insist on paying for the lamp. Forget the lamp. I'm so clumsy. Will you please take $10? Forget the damn lamp. Give me $5, we'll call it even. Allan, don't. You're making a mistake. I was joking. I was just testing you. It was not a technical kiss. It was platonic. I better go home. You're making an enormous mistake to think that I was dallying - Please, Allan, I'll be fine. Linda, you're getting it wrong. I attacked her. I'm a vicious jungle beast. She's panicky. By the time she gets home she'll be hysterical. What am I gonna tell Dick? She'll probably go to police headquarters. What did I do? I'm not Bogart, I never will be. I'm a disgrace to my sex. I should get a job in an Arabian palace as a eunuch. (DOOR BUZZER) There's the vice squad. Allan. Linda. Allan, did you say you loved me? ("AS TIME GOES BY" PLAYS) I still can't believe it. I haven't slept that well in years. Is it noon yet? No, it's 7:00. 7:00? I didn't realise it was so early. You were fantastic last night in bed. Thanks. How do you feel now? I think the Pepto-Bismol helped. What were you thinking about while we were doing it? Willie Mays. You always think of baseball players when you're making love? Keeps me going. I couldn't figure out why you kept yelling "slide". I guess it would probably be best if you told Dick. What will I say? It happened, it happened. It's not your fault, it's not my fault. You felt like a woman last night and I felt like a man. And that's what those kind of people do. But we can't sneak around and have an affair. It's so cheap. Well, no. Got to be honest with him. You just have to tell him that the two of you have grown apart and that you and I have fallen in love. That's if you love me. I do, Allan. Then we have to tell him the truth. I'm so tense. Maybe I'd better tell him. I've known him longer than you have. No, I'd prefer to do it. Maybe you'd better do it. Tell him what, though? Tell him that the two of us are right for each other and that maybe you ought to think about getting your stuff and moving out and maybe moving in with me, give it a try. I think as long as we handle this in a mature way, as long as I'm mature and you're mature and both of use are mature, we can achieve a certain maturation that guarantees maturiosity. Well, you're mature and very wise. Well, I think the key to wiseness is maturiositude. Why is it always so complicated? we can achieve a certain maturation that guarantees maturiosity. Well, you're mature and very wise. Well, I think the key to wiseness is maturiositude. Well, you're mature and very wise. Well, I think the key to wiseness is maturiositude. Why is it always so complicated? Well, I think the key to wiseness is maturiositude. Why is it always so complicated? If you want me, I'll be home on the floor having an anxiety attack. Kid, she loves you. Why not? I was dynamite in bed last night. That lucky girl. I gave her my best moves. (WHISTLES) (DOG BARKS) Excuse me. Could I - I want to take a look at the music box in the window. There's a nice brown sort of small music box. > Allan. Allan. Nancy. What are you doing here? I saw you walk in. I was calling you. Didn't you hear? No, I was - I was thinking about some stuff. Still daydreaming. How are you? OK. How are you? I'm OK. I just got back from New York. I'm going to move back there. Really? Is that so? Yeah. I don't know what to say. So, what are you doing? You know, the usual. Going to the movies. Staring off into space. Are you seeing someone? No. You know, I go out. But not... How are Dick and Linda? She's fine. I wouldn't know. At least you're in a lot better spirits than when I moved out. I am, because you got me on an up-day. Is this the music box you wanted? It's pretty. I need to keep my paperclips in something. You know... Listen, I have an appointment with a diet doctor. You don't seem overweight to me. Let's not have that argument again. Right. Right. Bye. So long. It was nice seeing you. Thanks. You too. 'That was real cool.' 'Why not? She never understood me.' 'I'm complicated.' 'I think Linda understands that.' 'Linda finds me exciting.' 'What the hell, Dick will understand.' 'Why not? Because of our social encounters, romance has developed.' 'It's a natural thing amongst sophisticated people.' You sent for me? Yes. Good. Great. Quite. Scotch? Fine. Hmm? Please. Soda? A dash. Linda and I are in love. Just as well. I've come from my doctor. He's given me two months to live. Good, then you don't mind. Not a bit. Cheers. Cheers. Dick and I have been through a lot together. He's my best friend. This is terrible. This is going to hurt him, I know it. How could they? My wife and my best friend. I loved her. I loved him. Why didn't I see it coming? Me, who had the foresight to buy Polaroid at 8 1/2. 'Dick is an emotional guy.' 'He's liable to God knows what, kill himself or something.' Kill himself? Do you ever think what he might do to you? You've heard the unwritten law, you take a guy's wife, you humiliate him. You've seen enough Italian movies. And Dick's got a temper. Bastardo. (SPEAKS ITALIAN) Stupido, eh? Imbecile! Imbecile! Imbecile! Imbecile! Imbecile! Imbecile! Imbecile! Allan. Allan. What are you doing here? You're supposed to be in Cleveland. I had to come home. Allan, I've got to talk to you. (MUSIC BOX PLAYS) I've got a problem. What do you mean? Allan. I think Linda is having an affair. I called her at home, she's not there. These past few weeks she's been distant and distracted. Little things only a husband would notice. I don't understand it. You've seen her a lot these past few weeks. She's changed. The other night she spoke about having an affair in her sleep. Did she mention any names? Only yours. When I woke her and questioned her she said it was just a nightmare. I keep trying to think of who it could be. It's got to be somebody I don't know, somebody she met through work. An agent or an ad executive. Photographer. Maybe an actor. Don't get upset. I love her. She leaves me, I'll kill myself. Since when are you so emotional? I've never been in love with anyone before in my whole life. If I find out who the guy is, I'll kill him, I swear. I neglected her and now she's involved with some stud. If I haven't already lost her to someone, I am going to make up for everything. I'm going to change. I'm going to do everything I can to make her life with me fun and exciting. Because without her it wouldn't be worth living. I was up all last night in a hotel room in Cleveland and thought I'm losing her, it's too bad, I'll survive. I panicked and I called her. She was out. When I called her here she said she was going home. Where did she stay? Calm yourself. I've got to find her and stop her and beg her forgiveness before it's too late. I want her to get on that plane with me and go to Cleveland. I want her with me all the time. I want to hear her laugh and speak. I want to pamper her. I want to take care of her. I'm sorry for carrying on like this, but you're the only friend in the world who would understand. I understand. Look, Allan, if she - Allan, if she calls, tell her I've got to talk to her. Tell her I'll see her at home. (I'll tell her.) Thanks. Thanks a lot. How can I break up his home? He's crazy about her. I never realised how much. He never realised how much. (PHONE RINGS) Yes? Hello, Linda. Hello? I'm in the middle of a conversation might now. I'll call you back. Linda, don't - So that's really it? (PHONE RINGS) Yes? Hello, Linda. I have to speak to you. Have you told him anything yet? Who is that? Is that him? This is Allan. Allan, I'll speak to you later. Don't hang up the phone! Hello, Linda, listen. This is urgent. You sound terrible. (SPEAKS CHINESE) Excuse me. That wasn't her. I just hope you know what you're doing. Oh, Di- (PHONE RINGS) Hello, Linda. (STAMMERS) Is the coast clear? Can I speak? I really ought to be in Cleveland. There's an important session. Wait, Dick. Dick! Say... Just answer in... I'll speak to you later, Allan. Hello, Linda. (STAMMERS) Is the coast clear? Can I speak? I really ought to be in Cleveland. There's an important session. I really ought to be in Cleveland. There's an important session. Wait, Dick. Dick! I really ought to be in Cleveland. There's an important session. Wait, Dick. Dick! Say... Just answer in... I'll speak to you later, Allan. Wait, Dick. Dick! Say... Just answer in... I'll speak to you later, Allan. Say... Just answer in... I'll speak to you later, Allan. I've got to speak to her before she says anything to him. You looking for the Christies, they just left for the airport. Just now? Together? One right after the other. Taxi! I'll tell her it's over, that's all. It was fun, but we lost our heads. What if it's too late? What if Linda's really hooked on me? Once a woman's been made love to by someone who can really do it great... I was incredible last night in bed. I never once had to sit up and consult the manual. Love is very different for a woman, it's a complicated phenomenon. I don't know what to expect, I've never broken off with a girl before. You told me you loved me. Try and take it gracefully. But the time we spent together, the closeness, the promises. Linda, please. You mean too much to me. I can't let you go. Don't get difficult. I'm sorry. Sorry's not enough. You think I'm some sort of play toy? What can I say? Give me the letter. What letter? Philip, give me the letter. There is no letter. I want the letter. Give me the letter. You're going crazy. You can't treat me like this. Don't pull the trigger, I'm a bleeder! Pull yourself together, kid, you're hysterical. You should feel encouraged. When you weren't coming on phoney you got a pretty good dame to fall for you. You never thought you could make it with dames. You can. It's got to end and I don't know how. It's not that hard, kid. Watch. Come here, sweetheart. Yes, darling? It's over. What is? Us. Over? That's right, toots, over. Kaput. That simple, eh? That's right. Supposing I say no? Won't do you any good. And will this? Come off it, sugar, you never could use a rod. But why does it have to end before it can begin? Because you play too rough for me, sugar. It was you that killed Johnson. Parker found out about it so you killed him. But that wasn't good enough, you wanted to finish me off. You couldn't when I was facing you so you'd get me to turn my back. But not me, sugar. Now let's go. You're taking the fall. That's all there is to it. For you, because you're Bogart. Everybody is, kid, at certain times. You're doing something now I didn't think you had in you. You're passing up a tomato because you don't want to hurt a guy. If I did that there wouldn't be a dry eye in the house. But I'm heartbroken over it. All the more reason you should feel proud of it. You think so? Sure. Listen, kid, there's other things in life besides dames. One of them is to know you did a right thing for a pal. Think it over. Can you tell me what gate the flight to Cleveland is on? Yes. It's gate 15. Where's the plane to Cleveland? Gate 15, sir. Linda! Linda! Linda! Linda! Wait. Allan, what are you doing here? I have something very important to tell you. So do I. Linda - Do you realise what a wonderful thing has happened? Linda! Linda! Linda! Wait. Allan, what are you doing here? Linda! Linda! Wait. Allan, what are you doing here? I have something very important to tell you. Linda! Linda! Wait. Allan, what are you doing here? I have something very important to tell you. So do I. Linda - I have something very important to tell you. So do I. Linda - Do you realise what a wonderful thing has happened? Doesn't that surprise you? You didn't have to do anything. You didn't have to leave any half-open books lying around. You didn't have to have on the proper mood music. I even saw you in your underwear with the days of the week written on them. We have to call it quits. Yes, I know. Pardon me? Suddenly everything became very clear. When I asked myself, do I really want to break off my marriage, the answer was no. I love Dick. And although someone as wonderful as you is very tempting, I can't imagine my life without him. You can't? He needs me, Allan. And in some unexplainable way, I need him. I know he needs you. This is the first time I've been affected by anyone besides Dick. I'm already in love with you. Unless I stop it now, I'll become too deeply involved to go back to him. I don't regret a moment of what's happened because what it's done for me is to reaffirm my feelings for Dick. Linda, I understand, really. You sure? You're not just saying that to make things easy? I'm saying it because it's true. Inside we both know you belong to Dick. You're part of his work, the thing that keeps him going. If that plane leaves and you're not on it you'll regret it. Maybe not today, maybe not tomorrow, but soon, and for the rest of your life. That's beautiful. It's from Casablanca. I've waited my whole life to say it. I thought I saw you here. What's going on? There's something you should know before you two leave. Us? You're coming with me? Look, nobody owes me any explanations. I'm going to anyhow because it may mean something to you later on. You said you thought Linda was having an affair. Yes. What you didn't know is that she was at my house when you called. She came over to baby-sit with me because I was lonely. Isn't that right, Linda? Yes. Over the past weeks I've fallen in love with her. I hoped she felt the same way. I tried everything but all she could talk about was you. I understand, Allan. I hope you do. We'd better be going. I'll call you, Allan. (DRAMATIC VERSION OF "AS TIME GOES BY" PLAYS) That was great. You've really developed yourself a little style. Yeah. I do have a certain amount of style, don't I? Well, I guess you won't be needing me any more. There's nothing I can tell you now that you don't already know. I guess that's so. I guess the secret's not being you, it's being me. True, you're not too tall and kind of ugly, but what the hell, I'm short enough and ugly enough to succeed on my own.
