THE WORD "GATAO" ORIGINALLY REFERRED TO RELIGIOUS PRACTICES AND ACTIVITIES THAT UNITED LOCAL INFLUENCES OF THE "ZENGTAO" ORGANIZATION. NOWADAYS, IT HAS BECOME ANOTHER WORD FOR "GANGSTER." Come on. Eighteen! - Still nothing. - Let me do it. Eighteen! Hey. Excuse me... A- Chuan. Doing well lately? If you want to follow Wen-Jeng, give us a heads up. Or it'll make things awkward for me. That's right, A-Chuan. That's not very nice, you know? When are you returning the money you owe to Boss? Say something. Fuck, didn't you hear him? Say something. I think we may as well take him back. - Let's go. - What are you doing? Fuck. Someone's coming! Let's go. Ching-Fong! Let's go! Fuck... A- Shiong, go! Drop your weapons! Hands on your head! These three years have been long. I did a lot of thinking. The world outside has changed. The A-Hua I knew growing up has a small business inside the market. If it wasn't for me, he would never have joined the gang. Or got stabbed protecting me. A- Guo. He's the bodyguard of Yong-Sun. In charge of his safety. A- Kai. He's just following Ching-Fong around. With no opinion of his own, like always. Ching-Fong. He's inside the core operation. Everybody thinks he will be the successor to Dingzeng. So you're saying that the market area belongs to the Dingzeng gang? What more is there to say? Wen-Jeng. The market has always belonged to Dingzeng. Do you think it's right to just come as you wish? Fuck! Cut the old crap. Now even the president gets elected every four years. If you hang onto this forever, what should our gang do for a living? Let me tell you. I will never give up the market. If you're not happy, tell your boss to come. I'm not here to discuss things. If you dare step in here again, - I will kill you. - Just try! Stop! They say that the blind have two holes for eyes. You don't even have one hole! What are you saying to my boss? Shut up! Damn, shut up! Greet brother Wen-Jeng. Greetings, brother Wen-Jeng. Mr.Hsu, will 35 do? Take off 0.5 from the chest, it will look smarter. Yes. I will mark that down for you. FUNERAL HALL OF MR. HSU WAN-HE Bow three times for respect, please bow. Bow again, the third bow. End of ceremony. POLICE Thank you. Presenting flowers. Bow three times for respect, please bow. Bow again. The third bow. End of ceremony. The family express their gratitude. Thank you. Yong-Sun from Dingzeng. Why did you want to see me? Michael. You have no business here. You should go back to America. Don't you understand? There's a lot of things you don't understand in Taiwan. Things you won't be able to handle. I will take care of your dad's business. You can go now. This is my world, motherfucker. Inmate 0520, released. Stop looking, you want to come back? Got you! Got... go to hell! I just got out. Sorry. - Wow. - What? You're a whole new level now. Brother Shiong. You fool. How come only you came? Yong-Sun told them to take care of some business. Yong-Sun is waiting for you. Hold on. Here, there's one here. Never coming back! What's this at the back? That's my wife. - Your wife. - Don't underestimate her. She's even got a C cup. Are you a pervert? I'm driving! Honestly, what plans do you have this time? Look who's back! Looks like you forgot. Auntie, A-Shiong is back. Auntie. - This apple is for you. - Thank you. Auntie, you're not being fair. How about me? I'm just kidding with you. I don't need one. Using the market as the center, the seven streets surrounding it is our Gatao. Dingzeng is the place where I grew up. I'm so happy to see you. You haven't had my fish balls for so long, here's some for you. It's the people. You're kind, thank you. These people watched me grow up. Grandma comes here for her clothes. - Auntie. - Your grandma hasn't been for a while. Your hair hasn't changed. I just love being beautiful. You've put in effort, the side perm. Here... is home for me. Okay, will do. - Master. - Hey, isn't this A-Shiong? When did you get back? Congratulations. - You've got to be more accurate. - Come visit. See who's back? Oh! Brother Shiong! Haven't seen you for a while. Yes. You've put on weight. - Did you miss me? - Yeah. - You have clients waiting. - Okay. I'm going to go make some money. Hey, pretty wife. I'll put you right here. Make your husband rich! Take your time. I want the necklace. The necklace? Great choice. A- Hua. What? You wrote me saying that you were selling boutique products. Is this what you were referring to? These are from Japan. You have no idea how much these old ladies love them, silly boy. Yes, please wait. For you. I have clients waiting. Now... This one? I'll sell for 100. Give me 100 and I'll take it. Here you go. Can I have it cheaper if I buy three? Cheaper for three? You really want three? How many husbands do you have? - A-Hua. - Hm? I'm going to visit Grandma. Wait, I'll go with you. Don't worry. Yes, take your time. Hey, A-Shiong. Silly brother. Okay. A- Shiong. We'll have a drink tonight. Grandma. It's good that you're back. It's good that you're back. Come. Step over the fire stove. Dear God, gods and deities, you all saw that my A-Shiong has returned. Please let him be solid and responsible. Be a good kid, and find a good job. You don't have to worry. I've grown up. That's good. That's good. Come, let's light incense for your mother. Tell her you're back. XU-RI CONSTRUCTION CONSULTANT CORP. You just gamble your days away, eh? Didn't you see? Fuck, put these away. You want the world to know how many firearms you have? What the hell, are we in chaos now? A- Guo. Give everybody their share for the month. Take it. All right. Come. And you don't need any? - There you go. - Don't spend it too fast. Give some to your parents too. Do you hear me? Yes. I thought A-Shiong had arrived. I prepared so much food. I still have to cook it. Cheers. Congrats, A-Shiong! A- Shiong, this is for you. The last few years have been tough. A- Shiong... haven't drank in so long. Brother. Congrats, this is to you. A- Guo, stop making A-Shiong drink. Or soon he'll faint. A- Shiong, this is to you. Damn you. You're underestimating A-Shiong. He never refused a drink when he was out with me on business. - Never got drunk. - That's impressive. Didn't you know? Boss, now I've got to have a drink with you. - Really. - Come on. Down it. It's all right. I'm happy he's back. - Here. - We split the drink. Here. Thank you for taking care of me. All right. Downing the lot. Nice. Like a man. Now, who else wants to have a drink with me. Me. I was busy. That's why I didn't go pick you up. Don't overthink it, brother. How dare you. You didn't even come for me. Are you done with your bonding? Done bonding? Everybody is here. I have an announcement to make. Now that A-Shiong's back, he has to work and start contributing. So, I have a job for him. From now on, he will be in charge of the market. Ching-Fong, what do you think? Leaving it up to you, Boss. You'll take care of the market. If you need any help, go to Ching-Fong. - Here's to the commanding team. - Cheers. Come on, everybody. Here... Brother Shiong! - Bottoms up - Down it! Cheers. A- Shiong. What's this? Buying big gifts now? It was a hard time for you. Silly brother. I knew you were going to say that. It's better that I get caught than have everyone going down. Honestly, did you ever regret it? Regret... Grandma is family. Brothers are for life. But being a gangster? I really don't know anymore. Gangster life... Any death today, will be forgotten by tomorrow. Just help A-Hua with his business in the market. Keep an eye out for things there. Brother. Thanks. LOTUS Morning. What's this? You need to go shit or what? No, I haven't eaten. Come on, I'm hungry. Give me a bite. Are we in chaos now? - Giao, you scared me to death. - What the hell? I was here to chase away the flies. Chase flies? Chase flies my ass. I bet you're the beetle. Go away! Take a look at yourself, Fatty. You're running out of space to gain more weight. Go! Go away! Fuck. You adulterous couple! That's not right. You robbing couple! A- Shiong. A- Shiong. It's really you, Giao. When did you get back? Recently. That's not right. You should have come and visited me before. Have you seen Leilei? Why are you here? This is A-Hua's store. Selling bras. Are you selling bras now? Oh please, selling here? Go tell your boss. Tell him to give you a job that matches your potential. Don't sell this. Don't worry. If your boss can't handle this, come and see me. Got it? I got your back. Uncle, there's a large piece of land we own next to the Jiang-Guo Market. Actually, I'm into reconstruction. So I was thinking, the market... I'd like to do an integration. If successful... There's at least few billion new Taiwan dollars of profit. Is this Taiwan Cypress? I'd appreciate the help, Uncle. Come over here. This Jiang-Guo market you just mentioned. The managing fee we receive each month is far from little. You can't just walk in and change things. It will be awkward for me. The Yong-Sun that I know, is open to reasonable discussion. Your dad hasn't been gone long. And you've just recently taken up the reins. No matter what, you should still show some respect for the rules left by your elders. Rules are meant to be changed. When we were in the States, we didn't have any rules. Every gang has their own way of running things. Speaking for the police, just as long as they don't resume drastic measures, we'll stay out of it. I'll send someone to retrieve the things inside. Also, this is not America. We do things differently here. There are rules. My rules. Want some dry meat sticks? Is this your stall? The owner is in the hospital for dermatosis. He's not here, you... Hold on... Oh wow, look at that body. I'm guessing you must be an A cup and a C nipple. C nipple my ass! Pervert, freak! Hey! Your flowers. Hey, Giao. - Selling flowers? - No. There's a slut wearing a green skirt up front. Give this to her. - I'll help you give it back. - Okay. Not too much meat, please. Okay, no meat. A- Shiong, what are you doing here? No, this is... There was... a customer forgot it. Hurry, ma'am. Don't worry, let me help you. Hold this. I'll push, don't worry. Don't run. Stop running. The police are here! Don't run! Hurry... Stop running! Stop running. Stop! They're gone... Wait... Go in. Inside. Sorry, you have to pay for the parking. You're funny. The market belongs to Dingzeng. I've never heard of this. You're from Dingzeng, so what? Are you new here? Dingzeng's zone is only until section two. This is section three. This zone belongs to Daqiaotou. Get it? How much? One hundred a day. If you'd like to pay monthly, there's 31 days in this month. You can just pay for 30. I'll give you a discount. Granny. I'll help you with it, come. - Thank you. - No worries. Grandma, this is too good. Amazing... - Smells great. - Be careful. - It's hot. - Grandma. Hi Ching-Fong. Now… You're here. Haven't seen you in so long. Long time no see. - What happened to your hand? - Nothing. - I'm going inside. - Sit down. Happy that A-Shiong is back? Yes. - Come eat with us. - Okay. Come, while it's still hot. - So good. - Let's eat. Come on. Great. Yes, thanks. Leilei's not here yet? - Ching-Fong, sorry. - Leilei. Hi, sorry I'm late. - Pumpkin vermicelli - Pumpkin vermicelli! - You're here, Leilei. - Yes, Grandma. This is to punish you for being late. You blame me? And you didn't even say you got out. Are we not friends? - Hurry up... - All right, here's to you. What's up with the slow drinking? Girls need to have some grace. Did you know that while you were gone, she went and tattooed her butt? Is this graceful enough for you? Young people these days can do whatever they like. Just be natural and happy. - See? - Right. Just be yourself. Here, don't be shy. Let me tell you. The braised pork here, it's delicious. You know who brings me this braised pork? Everyday. Those years that A-Shiong was away, I receive this braised pork everyday with no fear of my high blood pressure. Eating all this, at my age? Eating this at my age... - You're talking about cholesterol levels? - Yes. Who bought this? Who brought this? Grandma. Let me know what you'd like to eat, and I'll get it for you. I told you. Fish and vegetables. - Fish. - Yes. Here, eat some fish. You eat it... Take it. A- Shiong. A- Hua. He grew up with you. Always agreeing with what you had to say. Following you around. You have to take care of him. I know, Grandma. Everyone, I hope you will all stay safe. Listen to Grandma. - Cheers. - Cheers. Cheers... - Eat fish. - Yeah. Yes. What? Grandma. We have some things to take care of. We'll eat with you another day. You haven't even finished. I'm sorry. - Thank you, Grandma. - Brother. I'll go and take a look, don't worry. Take care of Leilei. A- Shiong. You're still on parole. Let us go. Take care of Grandma. Leilei and Grandma, I'll be back soon. Grandma. Boss. Here... Do you want beef or pork? - I'm here for the managing fees. - For... what? - Managing fees. - Shit. We paid Dingzeng the fees already. Oh, you have a bad memory. Really, you didn't know? Listen. Hey! I'm from Aogang. Starting this month, we'll collect the fees. Hear that? Firearms? We have more than you do. People? We got more people too. So how about it? - Come on. - Send them to hell. Fuck! - What the fuck! - Fuck! Fuck you. What the fuck. Be careful. Let me tell you something. I'm A-Shiong from Dingzeng. Today, I'm going to save you some face. If you have a problem, we can talk about it another day. Let's go. Fuck you. Fuck you, yeah, go like a wimp! Great job... This braised pork is the best. Hi Grand-aunt. Hi Auntie. Hi Grandma. - You're awake? - Yes. Why are you so late today? No work? It's my day off today. Let me help you. What happened to your hand? Nothing, I sprained it. Sprained it? Don't worry, Grandma. It's nothing. You tell me not to worry. Let me ask you, when was the last time I wasn't worried about you? Listen to me now. When you came back, didn't I tell you to take responsibility? Find a normal job? Stop hanging around with those people. You won't be able to concentrate. You don't listen. Grandma, don't worry about this. I'm safe and sound. You tell me not to worry. Do you know how old I am? I don't have that many years left. I'm seventy-something. I won't be able to worry for another 30 years. Michael. What do you want? I recently finished integrating this piece of land. In half a year, it will become a busy tourist night market. My target customers are the endless groups of Chinese tourists. I need a competent person to manage this. Do you want to join me? Are you right in the head? I'm with Yong-Sun. You won't understand. You won't need to follow my orders. Once you are the boss of Dingzeng... we will be equals. A- Hua, what color did you say this box was? Black. - Black. - Yes. - Brother. - Hi, Ching-Fong. - Why are you here? - Hi, A-Shiong. How's the market? Not bad. - What are you doing? - Just going to the toilet. Let us do it. You always go to the toilet when we need you. I'll be right back. Be right back? It's always like this. Thanks, brother. Ching-Fong. Fuck, don't you listen? Don't take drugs again. Asshole. Hi, Boss. - I didn't. - Okay. Understood. Brother. What happened? Nothing. Nothing? - A-Hua. - Don't look at me, I don't know anything. Fuck, are you guys my brothers or what? Why won't you tell me? Fuck, we're in this together. Calm down. Hi, Uncle. Today, we're going to sort things out. Have a conversation. All right? Yong-Sun. Don't think that I don't know what you're doing. For the sake of your father, I haven't taken action against you. Those are the morals in our society. Yong-Sun. What age are you living in? Stop mentioning history. What are you saying to my boss? We can talk equality when you become boss. Fuck you! Who do you think you are? Yong-Sun. You're a man with reason. I don't understand. Don't you want to enjoy your later years in peace? Fuck! What did you say? So what? Fuck you! Don't you understand? What world do you live in? I'm trying to make money for everyone! I'm giving you all a chance! What, and I don't exist? Your territory, my territory... This is my damn territory! Are you going to sit down? Hi, Auntie. Sorry to bother you. Not at all. I let you wait so long. Not at all. Please sit. Frog. Yes? Sorry to bother you. I just wanted to say that A-Shiong has never stayed out of trouble since he was little. When he goes out, I often wait for him long past midnight. I'm worried when I come home and see him with wounds all over his body. And also... I see that he has blood on his clothes. Auntie, don't worry. I'll take care of this. Thank you. My biggesst wish is for A-Shiong to have a stable life. That's all. I understand. Packing up already? You sold quite a lot. - Hi, Yong-Sun. - Hi Shu-Fen, where's your husband? He went to get the kids. Yong-Sun, how are you? - How's business? - It's doing okay. Go to A-Shiong if you have any problems. Yes, I will. Giao is not here? Not sure what he's been up to. He hasn't been here for days. I see. - Hello, Miracle Teller. - Yong-Sun, you're not busy today? Just having a look around. Please sit... Want to know your fortune? Yes? Okay, let's do it. - Bamboo slips or word reading? - Word reading. Okay, write here. Here, please. Yong-Sun. The character you wrote here, "friend," looks steady and powerful. It tells your success in everything. People from all trades respect you. You know how to talk. - Come, pay for the session. - No need… - Yes… - No… Thank you, Yong-Sun. Thank you… The word "friend"... if you cover the top, it will mean "rebel." I would like a pack of cigarettes, please. It's you. Oh gosh, are you wearing children's clothes? Oh please, your boobs are falling out. Stop saying that, please. If I wore a lot, would you still come? You're right. There are certain difficulties you must endure for this job. Say... It looks like business is good inside. I'm the best in gambling. Yes... Leilei, your dad is here for you. Thank you. - Why are you here? - Yeah. Daddy came here to see you. Are you liking it here? It's okay. Have you eaten? Yes. Anybody bullying you? No. If someone does, let me know. What's wrong, Dad? - It's… - Money. Yeah… It's always about money. No, not always. Sometimes. - Don't get upset... - How much is it this time? This much. Come on. Dad, this is the last 2000 I'm going to give you. I don't have any more to give. This is the last time. No, that's not right. It's not 2000. Damn, that's a big difference. It's 200,000. Two hundred thousand? Yes... please don't get upset. Dad, why do you need 200,000? It's hard doing business in the market. But you didn't need to bet 200,000. Don't be upset, smile. Please, don't be upset. - What do you want me to do? - Come on, don't be mad. - Hi, Giao. - Hi, Ching-Fong. Leilei, share this coffee with your colleagues. Thank you. Well, I'll get going. I'll come with you. Oh... okay. What was that about? No, nothing. It's all right, just tell me. Well, business is not doing well. I needed some cash for some turnaround. I thought I could borrow it from Leilei. As soon as she heard the figure, she got mad. She has a bad temper. I'll have someone give it to you. No need... Giao, we are family. No problem. Are you sure? Yes. All right, thank you. - Be on your way. - Okay. TO YONG-SUN: HAPPINESS LIES IN GIVING HELP TO OTHERS Yong-Sun. The renovation of the market will generate huge profits. Many groups are rooting for it. Could you not reconsider? This kid, Michael. He's young and vigorous. Very hard to control. - Hi, Boss. - You're back. - Hello, Fisherman Boss. - Hello, Chairman. The people from the market... see if they want to exchange their current space for three times as much. Yong-Sun. You're the best at handling this. We have mouths to feed. It's not easy being a boss now. Boss. Help us out. As long as it's fair. These people make a living out of these stalls. Everybody has a family to feed. If we destroy the market, we're not sure when it'll be right again. It's also unclear how we're going to collect the fees in the future. If by any chance they lose money, how can we ask them to call us boss? I'm on it. A- Shiong. Stay with me. Don't make a move until I say so. Today, we have all the prettiest ladies in the store for you. She's Apple, that's Karen. She's Lulu, and here's Victoria. Which one do you like? What's wrong? All right ladies, let's not get in Michael's way for romance. Please leave. Lulu, pour some wine for Michael. Here's to you, Michael. What's wrong? Don't move! Put down the gun. I don't want anyone getting hurt. You're next. Sibala! Go to hell! I got a 10, drink up. You lost... Not drinking? All right, I'll drink. You strip. She'll strip. Pour the drinks... Strip... Your turn... Yeah! Oh, baby. Your scars are so manly. That's right. We gangsters fight for real, it's not just all talk. Right? - I think you just use your dick. - Fuck you. Did you know we were taking care of that Michael from Daqiaotou? Michael? I heard that he's hot. - Hot? - Fuck. As hot as me? What are you laughing at? You're a bad boy. But... I think Michael is pretty smart. He knew that we'd be coming for him. His backup got there really fast. Scary. We're not scared, that's for sure. See A-Guo there? He can fight 10 people at once. Our A-Guo can go one against 10. Seriously? Using a knife or gun? Of course a gun. A water gun. And then A-Kai... What? Are you surrendering? Shit. You win this round. As for Ching-Fong, he takes them on as they come. One by one. Of course, he's my idol. Just as well A-Shiong showed up. Just like that, he had Michael by the neck with a knife. Michael's face looked like shit. A- Shiong, couldn't have done it without you. Here's to you. If it wasn't for A-Shiong, we'd all be dead. Ching-Fong. Here's to you. - Here's to you. - Here. Brother. Here, cheers. Are you for real? Hey… Told you you can't drink, you still try. When do you want it? Not telling you. What are you doing? You guys keep up the fun. Bye, Brother. I'm going to get busy. Put on a condom. How did you know he needed to be reminded? Right. A- Guo, here. Pour me some. I'm going to the toilet. What's wrong? I'm tired. You can go. Why can't I hit the target? Madame. Wrong eye. Close this side, and open this eye. Aim through this hole here. So it's aligned. See, like this. Here. Shoot. Yes. Again. Got it. Like this. What plans do you have for the future? I'll work hard. And take care of Grandma. Your Grandma will be happy to hear that. - Thanks. - No worries. It's cold, you should go in. You won so many of these for me before. They hardly fit inside the house. You keep this one for me. Bye. Here, have some fruit. Wow, it's so sweet. A- Shiong's grandma brought it over today. What did she say? Did she say that he just got out? And she's worried that he'll get into trouble again? He's her only grandson. Just got out from jail. I understand her feeling as a parent. But a man needs to fight. Honestly, I really like this kid. And do you know why? Why? Because... he's like you when you were young. Popular, and friendly with people. So actually, you just like yourself. But really... I'm getting old. Time to let go. I'm planning on handing over everything to A-Shiong. CHING-FONG Yes? But do you think Ching-Fong will be okay with it? What's happening now? Also... If you try anything with the market, I will kill you. I actually admire you. You have skills. You have the potential to be a boss. Let me ask you something. Are you going to follow Yong-Sun forever? And he will hand over everything to you? I heard he has decided to give A-Shiong the market. Don't tell me you don't want something for yourself? You guys call yourselves Gatao, gangster brothers, with all that old-fashioned family shit. But when it's time to share the profit, it's the boss that gets it all. You can only wait for him to spare you a little extra. You work your ass off for him. Do you think it's worth it? It's different with me. We just want results. We pay according to your performance. It's like managing an enterprise. This is my world. And yours? Are you done? Fuck you! I won't do it again. - Hi, Ching-Fong. - What happened? Boss caught him doing drugs. He was having seizures. Doing drugs. Doing drugs! Whores, gambling and drugs. None of them makes you a man! When are you going to become a man? Kneel properly. I won't do it again! I won't do it again! And he will hand over everything to you? You have the potential to be a boss. Once you are the boss of Dingzeng... we will be equals. Ching-Fong. Ching-Fong. Why drink so much when you can't drink? A- Feng, give me a wet towel. Ching-Fong. Ching-Fong. I'll massage him a bit. - Why'd you drink so much? - Ching-Fong. - There's no use. - What? Fuck you. - I'm going to buy something. - Be quick. - A-Shiong asked me to deliver something. - All right. Can I have a pack of cigarettes? A- Guo... Fuck. Hey, get the guys together! - Grandma, I'm going out for a bit. - Wait. I said wait! What's the hurry? Here. This is a safety charm. Take it and stay safe. - You have to promise me something. - Okay. Stop fooling around. - Know how to think for yourself. - I know, Grandma. Know what? I haven't even finished. Start the IV and the electrocardiogram. Heart rate? One millimeter of bosmin, one every three minutes. - What's happening? - We're performing first aid. Wait! Stay here, we're still doing first aid. Please wait here. Sit and wait. Boss. Go and see how A-Shiong is, calm him down. I have plans. Got to pay to be a gangster. Did you see that? I should be the one lying in there! Hey, feels weird, huh? When A-Hua's not here, I have no one to fight with. Feels a bit lonely. Don't worry. He'll be okay. Hi, Leilei. I'll let you guys talk. Come out here. What's up with you now? You won't pick up your phone. I don't know where you are. You want revenge, right? It's none of your business. And you take responsibility for everything. You always swallow your words. Can you cry, shout, do something? I'm begging you. I saw your grandma the other day. You know that she's really worried? Can you care about how she feels? The other day, I thought it was you who got taken. Did you know how scared I was? Do you know how I worry you might be next? Could you please care about how I feel? Whatever... Whatever you want, I'm not the kind of man for you. And Ching-Fong is? Careful. A- Shiong to the rescue. - Get down here, A-Shiong! - Get down here. Get up here. - You threw a big one! - Watch it! You'd better watch out! How do you feel? About what? Leilei. You think she's pretty? What are you asking? How about... we get half each. Fuck. She's a person, not a thing. You said so yourself. I get what you get. But she's Leilei. A- Shiong. A- Guo, go back and rest. I'll stay. Take it. It's been chaotic lately. A- Hua, you followed me on this path. I didn't take care of you, it's all my fault. You have to get well. You have to get well. You have to get well. That's betting everything. Right. Nice. Still here? It's hard to win. Yesterday, A-Chuan nearly lost everything. But won it all back before leaving. Two hundred? You're short by how much? Oh nothing. Silly brother. If you can lend me some money, I'll pay interest. You have my word. Don't be silly, I won't take interest. Seriously, how much do you need? Get in. This is the one million you owe. Plus interest is three million. That's not possible. It's only for a few days. That's a lot of interest. You don't have the money. Your daughter has money? She can become a prostitute. - No way. - She's so pretty. There should be good business. No, it's me who owes you the money. I'll give it back. It's got nothing to do with my daughter. Please. Leave her alone, I beg you. Pick it up. The money inside is for you. And you won't need to pay me back. Thank you… But... You have to do something for me. Giao, what's up? Yes. What? Right. Okay... wait for me. Boss. Giao wants to meet up with me. - Okay, come back for dinner when you can. - Yes. Let me off at the intersection up front. A- Guo, please park the car for me. Going to the toilet. Get out. Don't worry, go park the car. Yes. A- Shiong, where are you? I'm just taking Grandma shopping, why? Something's up today. Watch out for yourself. Okay. Who was it? It's nothing, don't worry. Ching-Fong. Over here. What's up Giao? It's nothing, I thought that... I was thinking... have you seen Leilei recently? Owing money again? - How much? - No. I know, don't worry. Come on. I don't need money. I just wanted to have a chat with you. - All right... let's talk another day. - No... Ah! Grandma. A- Kai. What the hell? Don't go back. Just leave it to Michael. You'll be the boss tomorrow. Doesn't that work for you? No? Who do you think I am? What do you take me for? Am I that kind of person? How can I not take action? I... Grandma. Grandma. Grandma. It's all right. Grandma, you'll be all right. Grandma. Wake up. I'll listen to you. Will you wake up? Grandma! Grandma, wake up! Grandma! I will seek revenge for you, Boss. Anything from A-Shiong? TIMELY WIND AND RAIN - Notify me when I can share some profits. - Yes… Let's work together, okay? - Yes…Thank you - Here. Thank you. Here... Michael. Thank you… - Thanks for your help. - Thank you. Thank you all... Thank you, that's great... I'm happy to be voted Chairman for the Fisherman's Association. I want to thank Michael. Michael, please come up and say a few words for us. - No... - Yes… Come… We value your opinion. Chairman. That was very kind of you. Too kind. We all know that Daqiaotou recently integrated a new piece of land. It will become a commercial center. In the future, Wen-Jeng and I will be giving Chairman our full support. Let's turn this fishing port into a tourist destination. Let's all make some money! What do you say? Do you say yes? Yes! Let's go. Come on... A- Shiong! Let's go! Come on! A- Shiong, I thank the skies for you. Fate has brought us together, as grandmother and grandson. I often thought of that time when I said goodbye to your mother at the hospital. You held a pacifier in your mouth. You looked up at me with those big round eyes. I felt so much pain, but I didn't dare cry out loud. You were still so young. I had to raise you up somehow, even if it would be hard. You know, when you went to jail for your brothers, all these years, I never stopped worrying about you. I'm getting old. I don't know how many years I have left with you. I can only pray to Bodhisattva. Everyday, I wish for your safety and hope you come home in one piece. But being a gangster… I really don't know anymore. Gangster life... Any death today, will be forgotten by tomorrow. Subtitle translation by Diana Chen
