That's all? 13,30€ I'll let you know when I get going and we can meet up there. Ok, cool. Good, see you in a bit. Ok, ciao. Fuck! You fucking asshole! Stop that shit! What the fuck! 1 love money and money loves me. I am always open to new ways of making money. Making money is fun. Money is flowing into my life from all directions. 1 allow myself to be rich. 1 pay my bills gratefully and with love. Dana are you coming? Lunch is ready. No way I'm sitting at the same table with that psycho! Don't talk that way about your own brother, ok! My brother? That freak was hiding on the balcony wearing a horse head mask. 1 hate him! Why do you always have to scare everyone? Does it make you happy when other people are afraid of you? Give me the gear. Take off the fucking mask and give me the gear! What are you doing? I'm jacking off thinking about you! - You can do it for real. - Yeah? Where do you live? Doesn't matter ... I have a red Audi ... I'm parked near the Gay Museum... - Know where that is? - Yeah, I know. I'm only doing it anonymously. I'll put a mask for you on top of the car. Ok, look over there. Get up! Get outta here! Run! Every day good things enter into your life anew. Life is a joy, and fills me with new energy. My success makes me attractive and desirable. Life loves me. People see that I am a successful person. Where did you get that money? I earned it. I don't want it. Gay Museum Get lost you shithead! If things really go wrong: if you close the front door behind you and leave the key inside, then you have to help yourself. I'll show you how, with just a little piece of metal, you can open the door yourself. You only need this small right-angle piece, you stick it here in the doorjam... and voila, the door opens. What are you doing? Moor corpse from Giistrow Some Germanic and Celtic tribes used to sink homosexual men in swamps. - Hi Rachid. - Hello. Long time no see. 1 have a whole lot to do at the moment. - Is Tom there? - Yeah sure, he's in his room. Are you going already? Yeah, Tom wasn't there. But he was just in his room. Daniel, it's you. - And what is so surprising about that? - Nothing. Tell me something, how do you know that you are going crazy? When you think it is impossible for you to be crazy, no matter how sick you are acting. 1 am getting more and more forgetful. You think forgetfulness is a sign of insanity... but that's more like hypochondria of an intellectual. I can't find my underwear anymore. So what? I constantly need to buy new socks. Socks, ok... but underwear?! Maybe you left them at a lover's place. Bullshit, I'm much too middle class for that. I've never left something just lying around somewhere. That sounds like self-pity. Funny. I'm thinking about having a doctor prescribe me some testosteron, I've been so tired lately. - Can I call you back later? - Sure, of course. - Sorry about the mess. - No problem. - Cool place. - Thanks. Been living here long? Three years. What are you reading? I'm a lecturer at a university. Can you still get a hard on? Sure. Good morning. The first gay marriages, or marriage contracts, existed already in the 14th century at the height of piracy. Many of the pirates were men who had chosen a life among men... and aboard these ships there were what we would today call same-sex unions... with written agreements passing on a pirate's property to his partner in case one of them should die. The goal of homophobia is to make gays and lesbians and everything else that doesn't correspond to heteronormativity invisible. What are your experiences? What forms do homophobia and transphobia take today? - Yes. - A new form goes like this: I'm so tolerant that I don't want to know anything about your sexuality. I don't need to look at any films about it, hear or read anything about it... that's all superfluous, because I know all about it already. That's the same thing as me saying to a heterosexual: don't talk anymore about your sexuality, we don't want to hear anymore about it, don't talk about it anymore. Don't make anymore films, books or novels about it, we know all about it, save it for yourself. Yeah, I would be for that. What we are about to hear is the transcription of an interrogation from the 10th century. The text and the questions have not been altered. Question: Have you engaged in fornication in the same way that you engaged in sodomy? Namely by inserting your penis into a man from behind, that is, into his buttocks; and in this fashion carried out sodomitic intercourse? Question: Have you taken hold of someone else's penis with your hand, while he has taken hold of yours, and both of you used your hands to arouse each other's penises so that due to said stimulation semen has flowed onto the ground in front of you? Knowledgeable, no? The man knows what he is talking about. a little bit too well... Wishful thinking. Tell me, what's going on with you and Florian? 1 haven't heard anything more from him. 1 sent him a WhatsApp-message, - but he probably doesn't have any time. - Oh god. 1 was wearing a torn t-shirt, so he probably thought 1 was some kind of construction worker who was banging him. How dumb is that? Do you remember Andre? - The guy with the Israel fetish? - Turkish fetish. - Maybe Turkish. - But I don't mean him, 1 mean Andre Fischer. - The musical fan? - Oh, him. Ex Musical Fan! You remember, he had a huge crush on that real nice guy. Do I remember? Anyway, things were going great until the guy went home with Andre for the first time. All around the apartment there were musical posters: "Starlight Express", "Lion King", "Cats". All that crap was hanging everywhere. Anyway, in that setting the dude couldn't get a hard on anymore. And since then Andre Fischer hasn't heard anymore from him. So look at this. - Is that in "Berghain™? - Nope, that's his apartment. Within two days he completely redecorated the entire apartment. Look at this, just "minimalism" everywhere. What does he do on the weekend if he is not watching musicals? What else: sex. Anonymous sex, of course. What planet are you on? Well, maybe he watches action films at the "Cinemaxx"? Yeah maybe, it's never too late to become a real man. A beer. Get lost you shithead! No, I don't even know him. Closing time. - Already that late? - Yeah. - Goodnight. - Goodnight. Hey. Everything Ok? Yeah. Hair color? 1 don't know the hair color. Blond, brown, I don't know. Like I said, he was wearing a mask. A rubber mask? Rubber, latex, I don't really know. And you didn't know the man? 1 didn't see his face. Beside that, I don't know anyone who would come visit me in the night with a mask on his head. Please sign here. How good are the chances that the perpetrator will be caught? Not particularly good. Yeah, Ok. - Close the door securely. - Yeah, sure. The door is secure again. Here is the spare key. Have a nice day. - Thanks. - Goodbye. Here, I brought you something. - What is this? - Mace. Thanks, I don't need it. Keep it. Don't you think that it was political enemies? - The bar is in the middle of Neukdlin. - Yeah, still. There are enough homophobes. If it was just random, they would not have disguised themselves. They didn't disguise themselves. But you said they did. 1 said that I could not recognize anyone. Everything happened so fast. And there was that strange fetish guy who helped you. Creepy. Aren't you afraid? Actually, yes. I think I need get out of Berlin for a few days. What's up? Can you give me Tim's number? What are you planning to do? Do you want to kill someone or what? Take out your phone. 82341 Thanks. What do you want from me? The door was open. You didn't close it correctly. I didn't think that you were such a good kisser. 1 didn't either. We hide behind masks, behind fetishes, behind roles, behind muscles, behind beards, behind fashions, behind behaviors, behind straight-acting; behind youthfulness, behind beauty, behind normalcy and inconspicuousness: behind the hate against unmanliness Maybe anonymous sex is the continuation of our Invisibility the darkroom from which we haven't emerged. The shadow in which we are hiding from one another; from ourselves and what we really are. Maybe we're standing at the very beginning. Our visibility has just begun.
