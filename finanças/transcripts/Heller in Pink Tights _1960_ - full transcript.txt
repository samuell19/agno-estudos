- Go on, William! - Yes, sir. After them, Sheriff! Come on! After them! They're coming closer, William! Let them out! What are you doing? Keep after them. They're getting away. They got away. That there writ ain't no good west of Nebraska, Mr. Hodges. "Speak the speech." "Speak the speech, I pray you, as I pronounced it to you... "trippingly on the tongue; but if you mouth it, as many of your players do... - "I hed as lief..." - Not "hed." "Had." - "I had." - Head, had. "...had as lief the town crier spoke my lines." What are they up to now, baby? They're just rehearsing, Mama. So he's forgiven her. This is the third time that she's gone off on a buying spree... picked herself out a whole new wardrobe and charged it to Healy. So we have to skip town. Doesn't he know that if the law ever catches up with us, he'll lose his show? My clothes can't stand another horserace with a sheriff. It's Angie's fault. She'll be the ruination of us all. - She is fun, Mama. - She's a flirt. And a teaser. - What's a teaser, Mama? - Never you mind, baby. You're too innocent. She just looks at a man, and right away he starts... scraping sand with both feet. Look at Tom Healy. He doesn't know whether he's coming or going. Thinking she'll marry him. Why should he marry her when they already go to... Tut-tut. He'll never have any peace until he does marry her. And he knows it. And neither will she. Do you think that she'll give up her freedom? No, sirree... she won't give up her freedom. She's too full of the dickens. One of these days she's gonna be caught. Just watch and see. She is going to be caught, and it'll be the ruination of us all. How do you do? Mr. Montague. When I was a young actor, I used to worry about my voice holding out. - Now it's my kidneys. - Oh, ladies? Mrs. Hathaway. Miss Southby. - Baby, pull your skirt down. - Yes, Mama. Miss Rossini. Allow me. - I'm Pierce. You Healy? - At your service. The Great Healy Dramatic and Concert Company's arrived... to entertain, amaze, and amuse. - You'd better. - May I present our players? - Miss Della Southby. - Della, the unapproachable. Our charming soubrette. Known far and wide, Mr. Pierce, as the leading child actress on the stage. And Mrs. Lorna Hathaway, the divine. What's her changes? Flute-playing and bird calls. And Mr. Manfred Montague. Master of villainy and 26 dialects. And last, but far from least... direct from her performance before the crowned heads of Europe, her native land... and famed for her feats of prestidigitation, Miss Angela Rossini. Now you're talking, Healy. A well-dressed man like you, Mr. Pierce... you need a flower for your buttonhole. Very clever. Now, little lady... if you'd like to see the theater, I have the best theater in Cheyenne. Our town has got 22 of them, but my theater is the very best. Mr. Pierce, you have someone to take our pictures. How sweet of you. Look, Tom, a photographer. Places, everyone. What are you doing? I'm taking a picture. You're in the way. All right, boys, lift them up. All together. Get a good hold, don't let them slip. - They're sure heavy, ain't they? - It's all that lead in them. I've got to get this before they stiffen up too much. How were they killed? Killed in a gunfight. This way, folks. Mabry! I'll take your gun now, Mabry. For a minute there I thought we were gonna have a dead sheriff. Professional killer. Folks, follow me. The theater's right up this way. Lock him up, Sheriff. - You got to lock him up. - I got no grounds, Santis. - He made them draw. - That ain't enough, you know that. You'll get this back when you leave town, Mabry. Who's paying you, Mabry? Who wants the three of us dead? De Leon? That's who it is, ain't it? Because we won't sell out to him. Well, it's our claim. He ain't got no right to our claim. And he don't run Cheyenne like he does Bonanza. We got the law on our side here. Yes, sir, you sure have. You got it right here on your side. - Save the boards, we might need 'em again. - Who tied these knots? You better hope it does you more good than it did them. Got the latest equipment straight from Chicago. I've got this whole setup for the people who want action back here. That is, if they ain't getting it on the stage. Fine bar you have here, too. It's genuine mahogany. I've got your contracts up in my office. They're all made out. Yes, sir, a fine piece of old mahogany. You see, we consider this engagement as we would New York or Philadelphia. The Healy Company, Mr. Pierce, has the same high standards of performance. My throat is so dry. The stage is right out that way. - There you are, my dear. - Thank you, dearie. It's this accursed dust. Recovered, Mrs. Hathaway? Toute recovered, Mr. Montague. Baby. Miss Rossini. Yes? You can come up here, too. I'd like to show you my office. Thank you very much. - Now, it ain't very big, but it's cozy. - It's lovely. Nothing to read there, Healy. Same deal I give all the shows. - I think that... - Now. Look right through this window and you can see the actors. You have a charming proscenium, Mr. Pierce. Over here. Look this way and I can see my dealers. Keeps them on their toes, knowing I can see them. Yes, very clever. Mr. Pierce, my understanding was we were to split 70-30. - You have it 30-70. - Same numbers. - Yes, but in the wrong place. - I'll fix it later. You said you have some house scenery? - Sure. Loads of it. Right through there. - I'd like to see it. After you, Miss Rossini. I'll come along. I want to look at your lovely pictures. I've got everything. Everything from center-door fancy to kitchen and woods. - "Whether 'tis nobler in the mind..." - All right. Folks, there's no dressing rooms, so you'll dress in the hotel. It's right through this door here. It's the best hotel in Cheyenne. Mabry, I wanna talk to you. You back, Santis? Mabry, how much you want to leave me alone? You got Jensen and Slote. Me, I'm the only one that's left. I ain't going up for that claim. You can tell De Leon he can keep it all... like he wants. Me, I'm running. Ain't that enough? - What more does he want? - Ask him. I'm asking you. I'm begging you. Don't beg. You ain't no dog. You're a man. Don't beg. Tom! - Yes, Angie? - Don't leave me. Wait a minute. Nobody's leaving you. Is that for something you did or something you're going to do? For nothing. For you. - Angie. - Yes? Angie, now you know that we're broke. If we don't make it here, I don't know what we'll do. So, Angie... - Angie, please, no tricks? - But what could I do? Angie, no monkey business, huh? Signed, Mabry. Let me read this back to you, Mr. Mabry. It goes to Mr. De Leon... - Miners Exchange, Bonanza. Is that right? - That's right. A wire from Cheyenne, Mr. De Leon. From Mabry. Says he's filled two of the orders and thinks he can deliver the third right quick. Get ready the money you're going to owe him for the job. I sure wouldn't mind some of what he's gonna get. You will never be a businessman, Goober. You part with money much too easily. To owe is one thing, to pay is quite another. Giddap. What's he mean by that? I ain't sure, but I'm glad I ain't Mabry. You look lovely, honey. Lorna, aren't you two ready yet? - Yes, Tom. - You're holding up the rehearsal, baby. You know, you still look pretty good. Honey, get ready. We're rehearsing. Come on. Music. I fear you not and laugh at your anger. For I have proved my courage in battle. - A vile seducer outrages... - What's that? - What's what? - What did he just say? "A vile seducer." That's what I thought he said. What kind of a show are you giving here, anyway? This is a comic opera, Mr. Pierce. La Belle H?l?ne. You know, the story of Helen of Troy? It's one of our big, big successes. You see, in this I play Paris. He's a son of the king of Troy, and he's... - The handsomest man in the world. - Him? - Yes. - Of course, I wear heavy makeup. What part do you play? I play H?l?ne. The most beautiful woman. That I can believe. And this is my husband. - You married? - No. In the play. But I'm not in love with my husband. I am, how do you say, flighty? And besides, he is much older than I am. Always wanting me to behave myself and to do what he thinks is good for me. But I'm young and very beautiful, and do only what I enjoy. Nope. It won't go in Cheyenne. - No? - But this is a classic, Mr. Pierce. What's so classy about her running around with you instead of her husband? But he is so much nicer, and he lets me do what I want. Last month, the mayor's wife started running around with a young stud like him... and the mayor shot him stone dead. There wasn't a man in town... that didn't shake his hand for doing it, even the sheriff. No, Healy, you can't get away with making fun out of marriage in Cheyenne. But it's all right to kill people in Cheyenne? Mr. Pierce, why don't you wait until you see the show... with the pretty costumes and the orchestra playing... And the customers leaving? Chew up a little scenery... that's what they want around here: Blood and thunder. If all you got is this fiddle-faddle, you can pack up and keep going. I don't want you. You're losing your charm, baby. Well, Doc? All right, we'll rehearse later. Tom? - Hi, Angie. Look. - What? That's what goes here in Cheyenne, cheap acrobats. Since we can't do La Belle H?l?ne, we should do... Mazeppa. That has a lot of blood and thunder, and a man on a wild horse. - You mean a dummy filled with straw. - The horse is real. But they see real horses out here all the time. We should do Mazeppa... but I'll do the ride. - You play a man? - I play a man. - Come on, it's dangerous. - Why? They'd have to tie you on the horse, he might throw you. - We would be a big success. - Not if you were hurt. You worry too much. About me, about the show... Somebody has to worry. You know, the wolves are at our door. We don't satisfy Pierce, we don't eat. We'll eat the wolves. Pierce is a big fool. - But he owns the theater. - He should own a stable. You should own this theater. It should be the Healy Theater. The Healy Company and the Healy Theater. That's a lot of Healy. You'd put on all the best plays. You'd be very successful. - And what would you be? - The star. And people would come all the way from San Francisco to see me do... the wild horse ride from Mazeppa. Tom, I was just trying to help, you know. That helps. You know, Angie, I've been knocking around for a long time. It'd be nice to settle down... and maybe you and me... Tom, you're getting too serious now. Well, now, you... You come out here and you say you want to help. You know how I feel. A little help here, a little help there... and right away we are married. Look, you haven't been asked yet. Why are you so angry? Because I tell you the truth? Listen, you do so much for me. No one has ever done so much. - And now that I want to help you... - Look, you want to help? - Of course I do. - Go and put on a kimono. You get me so mixed up, I don't know which one to put on. The red one. Sometimes I don't know what you want. I want everything. You want too much. Angie, why don't you go and get some sleep? We have a big day tomorrow, trying to decide what to do. You might have to start practicing on that horse. Love and honor unite around my wishes. Still, the extraordinary emotion of Olinska haunt me... her disturbed looks, her eyes moist with tears. For what is her hand without her heart? Who art thou? Thy rival. What is thy will, thou brash intruder? - Thy death. - Coward. If our arms were equal... They are so. Behold, I wear no armor. Aim at my heart. It has now no defense but courage. And this good sword. Have at thee now. I yield. - I am revenged. - Guard. Great Heavens! The Palatine assassinated. My rival. Vengeance! You shall obtain it, and whoever the murderer may prove... it will be terrible. That is my assassin. Remove the mantle that conceals the wretch. No. Mazeppa, Prince of Tartary! Kill him! No! Stand back! Back, Olinska. He shall suffer the penalty inflicted on rebel slaves. Bring forth the fiery, untamed horse. Tie that vile Tartar on his back and turn him loose. Strip him of his clothes. Then, let the murderer be borne through sands... and rocks and wilds... till thirst and hunger, and scorching suns... kill him piecemeal! Where is the fiery, untamed steed? Oh, my father! Pardon for him who loves your daughter! Unworthy girl. All the power on earth cannot assuage my vengeance! Dearest father. - Dearest child, thou canst do nothing. - In mercy, hear me. Plead not for me, Olinska. Perish as I may... it is sufficient glory that I die for thee! Now launch the traitor forth! And let the story of his fate strike terror throughout Poland! Down! Angie, are you all right? You were more scared than I was. I was scared for the horse. Listen to them. They like it. Like it? They love it! Come on, let's go! Look, everybody. Change quick. We'll start the second act in 10 minutes. There they are. It's Hodges. Thought you got away, didn't you? Slap that plaster on them, Sheriff. - Stop that woman. - Sorry, I got a writ of attachment. - It's not legal here. - It's legal, all right. I got it right here in Cheyenne. - Will you please go and change? - No, you're not getting out of my sight. They're just going to the hotel, Mr. Hodges. Now, Angie. Excuse me. A man claims you actors ordered a load of dresses and skipped without paying. - They ain't actors, they're crooks. - What are you? If I'd come to your room, you would've given me the dresses free. Mr. Pierce, thank goodness you are here. What are you standing around for? You got a second act. Got to close the show, Sam. Man here's got a writ. - I don't care. He can't close my show. - You want to start a riot? Listen to the audience. They'll tear the place down. - We've got to finish our performance. - Don't pay them no mind. - I know this bunch. - Where could we go? - We are helpless. - Here, little lady. Thank you. You see what I mean? See that look in her eye? You'll get your money in the morning. Wait just a minute. You can come back in the morning with that paper, Ed. - Can't, Sam. - You're running for election again, ain't you? - Next month. - How many votes this out-of-town fella got? I'll be back in the morning, Healy. You be here. They're gonna finish the performance. Better have that money in the morning. Upon my word, Mr. Pierce. Oh, Angie. Thank you, Mr. Pierce. Come on in, let's see the show. You too, Ed. Fine show, Sam. - That's my policy. Always the best. - Fine show, Sam. You are a kind man, Mr. Pierce. - Thank you. - I only try to help people. You need any more help, you know where to find me. In your charming little office? I'm there 24 hours a day. You are kind. Then the safe fell off the elevator and Pat went up and down. And then he fell kaplunk on the sidewalk. Mike looked down and he said, "Glory be, is it dead he is?" - Doc. - And he says, "Pat, speak to me, and..." - Doc, have you seen Angie? - No, I haven't seen her. You got something figured out? Not yet. And then he said, "Why should I speak to you?" Meet Miss Della Southby. Della, the unapproachable. For only 50?, for one half of $1... you can visit. Oh, you fortunate man. For 50 cents, you get a picture of Miss Della. For only 50 cents apiece, and the very special price of $2... - Lorna. - What? - Where's Angie? - Have you lost her again? Why, we haven't seen her anywhere, Mr. Healy. Haven't you seen her anywhere, baby? You look at him like that again, I'll smack you. - I was only being polite. - I'll take three. Why don't you take Miss Della right into your home? She'll keep you so comfy on those cold and Ionely nights on the range. Good night. You go back to the hotel now and get your sleep. Remember, you're not a young man anymore. I'm as young as I feel. You look as charming in that dress as I knew you would. Thanks to you. - Our troubles are gone. - What do you mean? Mr. Pierce has taken over the money we owed that silly fat man. Mr. Pierce is taking... Tell me, what do you mean, "Mr. Pierce has taken over"? He took over what we owe for the dresses. Now we owe him the money. He likes us? - He does it for business. - Did you put up some security? What could I put up? I don't know. We are a great success and he wants to keep us here, that's all. How much time is he giving you? In a week, two weeks, we'll make enough... Didn't you promise to, you know, meet him? - That's later tonight. - That's tonight? - Yes, but I'll put him off. - Oh, Angie. Doc. Mr. Montague. But he's easy to handle, that type. He's so sure of himself. What's the do? We're shooting the moon. Get the other two started, huh? Just when my kidneys were settling down. But we don't have to go. We can pay him back in a week. He won't wait a week. This type doesn't wait at all. These men are wild out here. They are? You do your pitch with Doc. I'll see you in your room later. But I'll take care. I promise you. - I did it so we could stay. - I know why you did it. We are such a success here, for the first time. - We'll be a success someplace else. - I make things bad for you. Not ever bad. Impossible, sometimes, but never bad. I know why you're doing this, too. Why you give up what you want. I'm just trying to hold the show together. - No, because you watch out for me. - So? Is that bad? No, never bad. Wrong, sometimes... but never bad. You do your pitch with Doc. I'll see you in your room later. Carte de v/s/te. We're shooting the moon. Take the kid and make your exit and meet me at the hotel. - Thank you. - 50 cents, gentlemen. Sam, do you still want me to keep an eye on them? Nah, they ain't skipping town. Not tonight, they ain't. - You can't ever be sure with actors. - I can be sure. I'm real sure about tonight. Artistic poses by Miss Angela Rossini. Nothing here, nothing there. Allez- oop. $1, please. The same poses that have stirred the hearts of the red-blooded American males... from the great Atlantic to the blue Pacific. $1, please. $1 for these lively, spicy portraits. Thank you. $1 to set the blood tingling through your veins. Thank you. Who wants Angela Rossini? Take her beauty home with you tonight. Thank you. Who wants Angela Rossini? I'm going out this way. You follow in a little while. We haven't made enough money. I'm going to see if I can make some more so we can stay here. Whatever you do, don't lose what we got. I don't know why I play this darned game. I can't win for losing. - Can anyone play in this game? - We don't have women, ma'am. I would love to so much. I've just learned it and it is so amusing. Let her sit in, Tom. Give us the best-Iooking game in town. How sweet of you. Thank you. - May I sit down? - Yes, ma'am. You sure had them whooping and hollering. Mighty slick ride you made up there. Jacks or better to open. You know what that means, lady? Well, I think so. It's open. - Cards, lady. - Three? - Two. - Three for me. Dealer takes two. Anybody here can't afford to lose $10? May I put in another $10? You can put in as much as you got there on the table, lady. Just $10 for now. - I'm out. - I'll call. - Not me. - I'm out. Is this good? Three tens? That's good enough. I like this game so much. Hiya, Doc. Where's Angie? Is she coming? She's right behind me. - Mama? - What, baby? I can't put any more on. Then carry them, darling. It's more ladylike, anyway. Now, remember, we're just out for a stroll. Parasol. Mother first. $100. And $100 more. Too much for me. $200. And $200 more. But that's all I've got. You are not allowed... Table stakes, Mabry. You can't raise more than she's got showing. - That's too bad. - Wait. I would like to bet more, if you would. Well, there it is. - What're you gonna put up against it? - Me. You're mighty sure you're gonna win. Will you take the bet? All I can lose is money. What've you got? Four sevens. Four jacks. I hate to leave, gentlemen, but I really have to go. I'll pay you tomorrow. I generally collect right after I win a pot. - Later. Not now. - Now. Mabry! Santis, he hasn't got a gun. Turn around, Mabry. I ain't gonna shoot you in the back. You wait for me up in your room. Sheriff! All right, keep them back. Stay back. Keep away. - Mabry, this time you're not gonna get... - He drawed on me, Sheriff. - Ask any one of the boys. - That's right, Sheriff. I tried to stop him. Are you gonna let him get away with shooting up my place? - You want to swear out a complaint? - I got an engagement. - Wait a minute. - I've got an engagement. I'll swear out a complaint: Disturbing the peace. Come on, Mabry. All you'll do is march me down to that judge and he's got to let me go. Come on, Mabry. Honey, I'm sorry I'm late, but that fool sheriff... Here I am, little lady. What's going on in here? - They've skipped. - They sure ain't here. I knew I never should have put them in that room. Never give actors a room with a balcony. Don't even give them a window. You mean they went out over here? They'll do it every time. And after all I done for that little lady. I was just coming about some alterations on Miss Rossini's dress. I know what you was coming for, but you're too late. They've skipped. Why don't you go after them? They're probably headed for Bonanza. If I don't get them, the Indians will. Passel of them just jumped the reservation. Burning and killing all over the place. - It's your money. - No, it's not. Our deal is off. - You guaranteed what they owed me. - Show it to me in writing. - I got witnesses. - Not in this town, you ain't. I'll take you to court. You'll have a different tone before... - I'm waiting, Hodges! - Is that so? Well, you... I have a job for you. Mabry's on his way back. If he gets here, it will cost me a great deal of money. I don't want him to get here. There is no sense looking all over the country for him. He has to come over the ridge road. So pick a good spot and stay there... until he comes. All of us? I hope it will be enough. Mabry's worth six of you. So don't give him a chance. - Mama, did we get somewhere? - How should I know? Where's the rest of the wire? Give me a hand with this pole. How many more we gotta do today? Keep it in line, now! - Excuse me. - What's all this? The Healy Dramatic Company, sir. - Show people? - Yes, sir. Gotta pay these men double wages to get them out here... and they can't even set a pole straight. Excuse me, sir, is there any water around here? We're running pretty dry. - Just over that ridge there's a stream. - Thank you. - I see the storm pulled your wire down. - Injuns pulled it down. Come on, get your back into it! Indians, around here? Raiding up and down the line. They say the cavalry's driven them up north. That's what they say. You mean these are dangerous Indians? I ain't got these bluecoats along just for company. Where are they going? Howdy, ma'am. - Hey, lady, where'd you come from? - Watch out. What a surprise. Gentlemen, Miss Della Southby. Come on, baby. Gentlemen, how would you like to take Miss Della home with you? For 50?, for just one half of $1... you may have a picture. Mister, we're headed for Bonanza. Surely that's safe? That's to the south. Safe as any place in this country. Mister, would you get those females out of here? It's hard enough putting up this wire with the Injuns around. - Just trying to help you. - Carte de v/s/te, anyone? Goodbye, boys. Come to see our show the next time you're in town. Mama, a man! - Where? - Over there. - Doc! - Yes, Lorna? We got company. - What? - Look what's coming. - Turn it on, Ted! They're after us again. - Is it the sheriff? Let's not stay to find out. Give it all you've got. Come on, you damn nags! Hold on, baby. We're off again. Ted, let them out. - He's gaining! - He's gaining, Ted! He's gone, Mama. He's gone. I think maybe we lost him. - See him? - No, I haven't seen him anywhere. - Anybody home? - Mabry. - What are you doing out here? - Scared you, didn't I? We thought you were the sheriff. He's still in Cheyenne, figuring out where I got that other gun. - What gun? - Never mind. - Where are you folks going? - Bonanza. Ain't that a caution? So am I. - No. - Mind if I ride along? Gets kind of Ionesome riding all by yourself. This is rough country, you never know when you can use an extra hand. - That might not be a... - Tom. I would like to talk with you for a moment. - Excuse me a moment. - I got nothing but time. - Pretty country, ain't it? - Don't it ever end? Tom, why do we need him? You have a map, you know the way. - Just in case we run into trouble. - What kind of trouble? He's just going to ride along with us, just another hand... He is a killer. He could kill us all in our sleep. Angie, this man kills for money. You have money? No. - Mabry. You're welcome to come along. - Thank you kindly. Ted! Let's move on. You can make camp over there. There's plenty of water for the horses. I'm gonna scout around a little bit. I might not be back till sunup. Mabry. Any special reason? Don't build the fires too high. - Don't drag the costume, baby. - Yes, Mama. Mama has to wear it. This rain certainly didn't do us any good. This armor's a soggy mess. You're doing a good job, Doc. - Mr. Healy, I put your breakfast over there. - Thank you, Della. - Is Mabry back yet? - No, not yet. Good. Listen, everybody. Don't go too far away. - I'm gonna look around. - Where would I go? - Hello. - Who are they, Mama? They're Indians. Maybe they live around here someplace. Do you live around here? You speakee English? - Why, they're hungry. - I'll fix you something to eat. - Tom! - We've got visitors. Come on. Hello. Will you all start moving over towards the wagons? Tom, I think they're hungry. - Why, Tom? Come on. - Just shut up and do as I say. What did you do? - They just wanted food! - You killed them! Maybe I ought to let them kill you. Like they killed some soldier to get this. We better move fast. The one who got away will be back with his friends. I figure these three for a scouting party. Ted and Bill, where are they? - Our drivers. - Ted! Bill! Mama? Don't look, baby. Guess we'll have to bury them. No time for that. I'll get the horses. But to leave them like this, it... They don't know the difference. We'll have to leave the wagons. Just take what's important. - Come on, everybody. - Come, baby. Doc, will you come on? Come on. - Lorna, come on. Let's go. - Mama. Hey, perk up, pop. - Hey, Healy. - Yeah? Better get moving. I'll go on ahead. - Yeah, I'll send them along. - Okay. - Come on, Mama. - Your costumes, baby. All your best parts. Little Eva, Fanchon the Cricket, and Mother's Helper. Oh, Mama, throw them away. I'm 20 years old. - Well, I am. - Lorna, come on, let's go. - No. - Come on, baby. - Leave me here. - Let's not make a scene. - Leave me to the Indians. - Get on your horse. What does it matter? I'm dead already. - My child just killed me. - Come on, get up there, Lorna. - Oh, baby. - After all I've done for that girl. - After all I've done for you. - Get on! - You know I gave up my career for her? - Yes, I know, baby. And she's only 16. That's all she is. Everybody knows that. - I was a baby myself when I had her. - I know. - Hold on to the saddle, baby. - Della! Wait for me. Angie, can you please take this? Let's rest up. Over there. Why do you stay with us? Why don't you go when you can? I got to protect my property, ain't I? How are your kidneys, Doc? - Easy, Doc. - Thanks, Healy. - Snoogie. - Yes, dear. - I'll help you, Mama. - If you would, please, Mr. Healy. Of course, Mrs. Hathaway. - Stretch your pretty legs. - Thank you. Mama, don't be mad. - Did you see anything, Mabry? - No sign of them. But that don't mean anything. We just have to keep moving. Mabry, according to my map... there's a mission on the way to Bonanza. That's a long pull over rough country. Right over that mountain. You got snow, you got wind. You got trails where you take one wrong step and you're over the edge. Look, Mabry. If you don't want to come along, you don't have to. You've done a lot for us. I don't want you to feel you have to stay. I don't mind. I was raised to do good, and I like to do it whenever I can. No, I'll stay with you. - You feel better, Doc? - Ain't as strong as I used to be, Tom. Take it easy and rest. He better be ready to move soon. We can't sit here too much longer. - They can't go on like this. The women... - I'm thinking of the women. Them Injuns are riding without their squaws. You keep watch. I'm going to nose around a little bit. And remember, if they come, you're shooting downhill, so aim at their knees. - Get me some branches for a fire, will you? - What about the smoke? We got to take that chance. It's too cold without a fire. Course, there's other ways of keeping warm, but they ain't proper. I wouldn't care if it was proper or not, with somebody like him. Mama. Baby, that's a very attractive man. Isn't he, Angie? You look like you didn't sleep so good last night. I slept fine, thank you. Mabry, we're in the middle of a lot of trouble out here. You know, snow and Indians, a lot of trouble. Don't make any more. - I'm here to help you, Healy. - We're very grateful. But if I'm too much trouble for you, all you gotta do is say "git." I'll go. We need you, you know that. I ain't a man to look for trouble, but I don't run from it. I usually run from it, but not always. I can't figure it. He should have been here long ago. You know what? I think he's coming over the mountain. - Through all that snow? - There's Indians loose, maybe he had to. He ain't coming this way, that's for sure. You three wait here another couple of days, then head on back. I'm heading for the mountain. You going up against Mabry alone? He ain't looking for me, I'm looking for him. Besides, I can spot that horse of his a mile away. Mr. Mabry ain't never gonna know who shot him dead. Hey, Doc. That sun feels good, huh? Good on the old bones? It feels good to be warm, I can tell you that. Lorna! No more snow. We're almost there. - How about Indians? - No more Indians. Thank you, Mabry. The pleasure's mine, ma'am. Here, Della, let me help you. You know what? You're as pretty as the morning. Thank you, Mr. Healy. - Aren't you old enough to call me Tom? - Why, yes, Tom. - You've done it again, Tom. - Yes, Angie, we've done it again. - If that mission's where you say it is. - Maps don't lie, Mabry. Yeah, but people do. And they make the maps. You'd better start brushing up on your lines, Angie. We'll be on the stage before you know it. Come on. Would you get me some water, Angie? I'm all dried out. I'll bring you some champagne. - I'd be privileged to help you with that. - Tom will help me. Tom? - You scared to go down with me? - I'm frightened only of Indians. There ain't no Indians around here, I told you that. - You scared I might collect my bet? - What bet? What are you talking about? - I played poker with him and lost. - When did you play poker with him? I'll tell you later. Right now, we are in danger. - Ain't no danger here. - You stay out of this, Mabry. - You'll get your money. - It ain't money that she lost. What did you lose? - Tom, we are in a country of wild... - What did you bet that you lost? Myself. But I had four sevens. Tom, I would have told you. - How much was in the pot? - $800, $900. Against her? - Well, you got her cheap. - Tom. What do you want me to do, win you back? I'm a very poor poker player. - It was only a game with... - I'm too old for games. He'll get over it. He always does. Is it time, Mabry? Have you stopped waiting? You look so sure of yourself. Why? Because you know what I am. You do, don't you? Better than he does. And I know you. We're alike, the two of us. All we care about is what we want. They could have found us. Drop it! You thought it was me. Why? Why are you doing this? Who sent you, Gallagher? Who sent you? You wouldn't have tried this yourself, not on me. - Who's paying you? - Nobody! Well, who are they after? De Leon? They're trying to get me so they can get to him? Who's dumb enough? Who thinks they could take us? Mabry, I'll help you. Stay out of Bonanza. - I'm taking you there. - No! - Tom, are you all right? - Yeah, I'm all right. When I saw you falling on the ground, I thought you... It's nothing. But you are hurt. Let me help you. I can take care of it. Who's paying you? Mabry, I'll help you. Who sent you? De Leon sent me to kill you. - You're not getting off that easy. - I'm telling you. I did a job for him and I'm gonna collect. You'll never collect. He owes you too much. He don't wanna pay you, Mabry. You know what he's like. I'm telling you the truth. Get out of here. You mean that? But not back to Bonanza. I can't go back, Mabry, after missing you. He'd string me up. I don't want him to know you missed me. If he's hurt bad, you better get him to the mission. It's just over the hill. Over the hill? We're saved. Tom, we're saved. Mabry. Here. I wouldn't know how to use it anyway. Get the agent. My name is Healy, sir... manager of the Healy Dramatic and Concert Company. We've had a bit of a hard going, as you can see. If you'd be kind enough to assist the ladies... He's dead. I know it, he's dead. Put him on the bed in my office. Easy, boys. He's hit in the leg. Would you like me to get you something? Some water, something to eat? No, thank you. You slept a long time, you were so tired. - You feeling better? - Fine. The doctor said you would be walking around in a week. - You all comfortable where they've put you? - Yes, I'm fine. Better than sleeping out on those rocks, or all cramped up in that wagon. - Not better than the wagon. - The wagon wasn't much. Every time it rained, we all went swimming. To tell you the truth, when I saw them burning... I was relieved. I've been talking to the agent. He's going to buy the horses. You're breaking up the company? It wasn't much of a company. Kind of foolish, when you come right down to it. - Tom, listen to me. I'm sorry l... - There's nothing to be sorry about. - I wish l... - There's nothing to wish for. "Everything happens for the best," that's my new motto. We weren't getting anywhere. We were just wasting time. It's good we found it out. Saves everybody a lot of time. After a while, time is the most important thing. - Oh, Tom, you... - Angie, there's nothing to say. - Oh, he means nothing. - No lies. No more lies. It's easy for you to say that because it's easy for you to tell the truth. It has never been easy for me. What you want to do, you do. I want to tell you the truth. I don't think you know what the truth is anymore. I want to... That's what the truth is to you: What you want. You tell the Doc where you're going to be. When we sell the horses, I'll send you your share. What are you gonna do now? What I've always done: Get a job somewhere. What you need is a stake, not just a job. Enough to get you to San Francisco, get you some pretty clothes. I know where you can get that stake. Is there someone even you can't kill? You got no call talking to me like that. If I didn't kill some of them Indians, you wouldn't be here. I'm sorry. You're right, Mabry. You did so much for us. Then don't go treating me like dirt. You ain't no better than me. I'm worse, Mabry. Much worse. What do I do to get this, what did you call it, stake? There's a fellow named De Leon who owes me $5,000. For killing those men in Cheyenne? Yeah, he wanted them killed, and he was paying good for it. Now he wants you killed, so he won't have to pay you. That's right. I must admit, it's a way to save money. I want you to get that $5,000 for me. With a gun? No, with a note from me, telling him to give it to you. Sure, and he will give it to me just like that? He's what they call a respectable man, Mr. De Leon. They'd run him out of town if they knew he was going around having people killed. They might even hang him. With what I know on him, he'll give you that money. And then? - Then he'll have you trailed. - To you. But you ain't coming to me. You're staying right there in Bonanza. I'm coming to you. When? I don't know when, but you'll hear from me. There's $500 of it for you. Just for holding it? Just for you. You said you would give me a note. Yeah. I ain't got such a good hand. Think you could write it out for me? I mean I can't write it out so good. No, sir, I can't write at all. I can't read and I can't write none. But that don't mean I'm dirt. You are not dirt. Maybe with all that money, we could go to San Francisco. On a train. We'd have a high old time with all that money. What shall I write? We'll be in Bonanza in a couple of weeks. Will you be there? He's finished with me at last. He'll get over it. I've lived long enough to know that much. Whatever it is, they always get over it. You wait for me till I get in Bonanza. We'll persuade the natives there to part with some of their gold. And what a time we'll have, just you and me. Champagne all around. You take care of yourself. - I'll miss you. - I'll miss you, too, Angie. - You'll be hearing from me. - I'll be there. You be careful. Real careful. De Leon ain't no Sam Pierce. - He'd just as soon kill you as look at you. - Not the way he'll look at me. Come on, go! Come in. I brought you some hot soup, Tom. Thank you. You must get your strength back, you know. - Why? - Oh, you! Let me do that. You're still too weak, you'll cut yourself. - Have you ever used one of those before? - No, but I'll learn. I'm a very fast learner. Do you know I learned the whole part of Mazeppa in just one week? - You did? - Yes. And La Belle H?l?ne. I learned all of H?l?ne in no time at all. You learned those parts? In case of emergency. I knew how unreliable she was. Let's be fair, Della. She never missed a performance. But the way she played them. I mean, there was simply no excuse for it... playing opposite an actor like you. I've had a lot of experience. I'd give anything to play opposite an actor like you. You know, Della, you've changed in the last few weeks. You've kind of grown up. Of course, you are a little young for those parts, but maybe... I'm not as young as Mama says I am. Or as you think I am, Tom. I'm 20 years old. I'm 43. - Oh, you don't look it. - Well, I feel it. Look, Della, thank you for the soup and the close shave. Somebody has to play those parts, and she's not here. Della, there are no parts, there are no plays and there's no Healy Company. Hotel's right over there, ma'am. Nice clean rooms. Thank you. I'm just in, and I'd like to have something very, very pretty. No need to explain, dearie. You need a dress, we'll see that you get one. Here they are. Come in the parlor and we'll get you all fitted up. Take your spoon out of your cup while you drink, Gladys. - What'd you say you were, dearie? - An actress. Yeah. We're all actresses, ain't we? I loan this t?te-?-t?te chair to the opera house every time there's a show. What a lovely room. I try to keep it homey. Let's see. No, that's too big. That's no good. Oh, this is a nice one. I think a tuck here and there... Get me my sewing basket, Edna. - Yes, ma'am. - This is a beautiful dress. I made this dress for a dear, sweet girl. Passed away from the pneumonia. Never did know her right name. And she said to me... Her very last words, she said: "Mrs. Haddock, when I'm gone... "give this dress to one of the other girls, you hear?" She was Southern, poor child. And you're the first girl that's come along that was the right size. I won't be able to pay you right away, but... Don't worry about that. Just make some man pay, that's all I ask. For this purpose, a furnace was added with a capacity of 30 tons a day... using two blowers, one crusher, and a steam engine of 40 horsepower. Additional profit from this operation is expected to approach... 20% of the total investment. It is also recommended that the shipment of ore, coke, and bullion... be entirely taken over by the De Leon Transport Company... since this will ensure a marked saving in the transportation costs. - In my office. - Yes, sir. The advantages are economic, and not without savings to the company. Gentlemen. We'll have to continue the meeting some other time, I'm sorry. - Perfectly all right. - An important matter. I must give it my immediate attention. - My apologies, Mayor. - Goodbye. - How do I know this is true? - You don't. You've seen Mabry? He's alive? That man you sent, what was his name, Gallagher? It's a pity, a young man like that to have such bad eyesight. - Who are you? - Does it matter? Is this your family? How sweet. The boys look just like you. I could have you arrested, you know. Thrown into jail for trying to blackmail me. That's a serious crime. So is murder. In some places, even more serious. That depends on who the murderer is, Miss... Rossini. May I have the money, Mr. De Leon? You are very sure I'll give it to you. Mabry said you were a clever man. And a rich one. For a clever and rich man to save $5,000 and lose everything... it's, how do you say, a false saving? - You, too, are clever. - Yeah. But not rich. - You could be. - Yes, I know. All I would have to do is tell you where Mabry is and what he plans to do. He'll never be missed. And whatever he's offered you, I can offer a girl like you more. - Much more. - But you don't know the kind of girl I am. But what does a girl like you want, Miss Rossini? Money. Mabry's money. You see, you don't know the kind I am. You think I'm clever, but I'm really not. The money, Mr. De Leon, please. - It's in the other office. - I'll wait. Goober. There's a girl in my office. She'll be leaving in a few minutes. Get downstairs with Joe and follow her. Don't let her out of your sight. - Just watch her, that's all? - That's enough. - She's going to meet Mabry. - Mabry? - I thought he was... - Just do as I tell you. Now, go on. Thank you. - Aren't you going to count it? - We trust you, Mr. De Leon. How did Mabry ever find someone like you? It must have been his lucky day. Bye. - Don't forget your curlers, baby. - I won't be needing them anymore, Mama. But, baby, we're going to be among people again. - I like my hair this way. - Baby, it makes you look so old. Call me Della, Mama, that's what you named me. I'm 20 years old. Next month I'm going to be 21. The end of next month. - Goodbye, pop. - The wagon's ready, Doc. Goodbye. And thanks for everything. Well, Mabry, I... If you ever want to see a show, look us up. Whatever else happened, you did save our lives. I want to thank you for that. Maybe sometime I'll be in your neck of the woods, and you can save my life. You know, I probably would. Well, folks, we're here. Doc, you'll have your drink in a few minutes. Driver! Stop! Tom, look. Well, I've got to give her credit. - Don't be so quick about it. - She got you a theater, Snoogie. Come, Lorna, I'm not the only Healy. It's a common name. - Let's go inside, Mama. - Yes, Della. No, that doesn't work. Let's try something else. Here. This carpet. Just put it on. Let's get ready. Come on, let's start with the first act. You in the middle, over here. Where's the other boy? Come on. There. All right. "My pretty girl has left her nest so early this morning." - Angela. - It sure is good to see you again, Angie. I didn't think we'd ever see you. You naughty thing, you. Now, where are the dressing rooms? - Just back there. You'll find it. - Thank you. - Where'd you get the money? - I stole it from Mabry. Does he know it yet? There is nothing he can do. It's your theater, in your name. Did you think you could just give me this and I would take it? Even the way you think... did you really think I would take it? Not really. I just hoped. I wanted to do something for you. Something nice. So you... I don't know, you could think of me as... You see? I only think of myself. You're lucky to be rid of me. But the theater is yours, and I'll go whenever you want me to. - What are you rehearsing? Is that Mazeppa? - Yeah. It's staged all wrong. Everything is wrong. I'm trying to make costumes from I don't know what... old rags and carpets. And these people have no experience. They can't act and I don't know how to tell them. The horses didn't bring as much as I'd hoped. I don't want anything. Doc and the girls can't go to San Francisco without a new wardrobe. No manager would look at them, you know that. I'll stage Mazeppa for you and play it... until I can make enough money to pay back what I owe. - You can play your part, if you like. - I'd like to. - That's the only reason I'm staying. - I understand. I know. Everybody take your places. We'll pick up the rehearsal where we left off. Ladies and gentlemen, this is Mr. Healy. "Why, how is it my pretty bird..." "Has left her nest so early this morning?" Ladies. "Those downcast eyes and colorless cheeks assure me... "she has passed a sleepless night." - "I am deeply to be pitied." - "Pitied?" "You to be pitied? When there's news of nothing else..." ...throughout the castle except the news of your approaching marriage... to the young nobleman so rich, so elegant. Those nuptials can never take place. My heart, my soul, each energy of my existence... all is Casimir's. Casimir's! Heavens! That friendless youth. Someone approaches. 'Tis he. 'Tis Casimir. Good heavens, how agitated. Noble lady. Oh, speak without reserve, Casimir. My second mother here knows all. Before her, then, pronounce my fate. - Oh, your fate. - Yes. On you and on this moment, depend the destinies of my life. Like the show? It's too bad you can't see the rest of it. Gets mighty exciting later on. Adieu, my love. - Hello. - I ain't got much time. Old De Leon's got his boys watching this place. Did you get that money? - You're a real gooder. - I have something to tell you. - Just tell me where that money is. - I spent it. Hello, Mabry. How many times do I have to tell you not to move on my lines? - But you always told me... - On other actors', Della, not on Mother's. Listen, I was lucky to get it. Everyone said it's worth much more than $5,000. And I'll pay you back every cent. - Where do you think you're going? - I'm going onstage. - You ain't going nowhere. - What do you mean? What are you standing around for? You're on next. You stay out of this, Healy. Keep your business with him out of the theater. - Go play your part. - I said stay out of it. When my cue comes, I will be onstage. And we'll talk after the show. You and me'll talk right now. You trying to make a fool out of me. I don't like that. I'm only trying to explain. - There's your cue. Go on. - Don't give me no trouble. You come on over here. I wanna talk. You let her go. She has to go on the stage. Mabry. Please don't. These amateurs are the curse of my life. You get on the stage. Run. I'm gonna kill you, Healy. I demand an... I demand an explanation. There's a man in our dressing room. And he's drunk. That your room? Hold it, Joe. They got any other ways in here? - Who's after you? - De Leon. He missed me once, but he'll make sure this time. Lock the door on the other side of the stage. You come with me. Come here. Can you see them out there? Count, with the utmost joy I shall attend thee. - They're out there. - All right. You stay here and don't try anything. I don't want you spoiling my show. My esteemed Count Castellan. Only pressing matters of state could have kept me from your presence. It was my wish, my fair Olinska... to present to thee my homage, but ancient custom does not permit... a Palatine of Poland to offer his vows in person... till after a solemn ceremony. The Countess's coronet must be presented to the intended... and she returns her ring in exchange. From that moment, she is his affianced bride. My envoy this day will come on this very important mission. Good night, my sweet Olinska. - Who art thou? - Thy rival. Have at thee. That is my assassin. Remove the mantle that conceals the wretch. - Healy. - Take it easy. Just enjoy the show. - Back, Olinska. - No! He shall suffer the punishments inflicted on rebel slaves. I'm getting out of here. You listen to me. There's an old mine just north of town. - I can wait there for you till morning. - I can't get the money by then. - Mabry. - In a minute. Look, you're in my neck of the woods. You want me to save your life? Then come on. I'll be waiting for you. Now, launch the traitor forth! It's Mabry! Well, he made it. He got a... - Don't be too long, Mama. - I won't, Della. - Snoogie, come have supper with us. - Later. Snoogie, forget her or don't forget her, but we can settle down now. - We've got a theater. - All right, come on, Mama. - Are you coming, Tom? - I'll meet you later. Let's go, Mama. You can't say we didn't open with a bang. I'm sorry I took so long. First to find that silly man, and then to get him to open that silly bank. And that ride. I thought I would never find Mabry. But I had to give him back his $5,000. He helped us so much. I didn't want him to think I would cheat him. You got $5,000? - That was all I owed him. - In the middle of the night? Some things are easier to get at night. And this time I could put up real security. - What did you put up? - The Healy Theater. The theater? This is in my name. I signed your name. Mrs. Thomas Healy. But the man said it was all right. He thinks we'll be a big success in Bonanza. Of course, we'll have to stay here for a... I know. I haven't been asked yet. - I ask you, Angie. - Thank you. I have to put out the lights. But it was wrong of you to hit Mabry. - He hit me first. - That's no excuse. It's against your nature. And I want a man of your nature, not his. - Angie. - Also, you are much stronger than he is. You could have hurt him.
