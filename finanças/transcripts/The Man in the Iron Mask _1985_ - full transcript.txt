Will you examine him yourself? - Your word is enough, Peronne. - [de Chevreuse] Here is the letter from our mistress. - Our humble duty to our Mistress Madame.

Where was the letter? - It must've blown down the well. Oh, poor boy, he's so honest, what are we to do? - We must do our duty and inform the Queen. (suspenseful music) (Queen sobs) - But what am I do to my, Lord Bishop? - Your Majesty, what can you do, except act for the good of France.

(drum rattles) - [Philippe] Perrone, Monsieur LaCrosse. Help me. - Philippe, Philippe. - In the name of France. (horse whinnies) (bugles play) (crowd banters) - My goodness, Athos this is all too grand for a retired country gentleman, like me. My clothes are years out of date. - But your stout heart, Porthos, will always be in fashion. Look, here's an old friend. - What, Aramis, is it you old boy? - I am now the Bishop of Vaun, Porthos. Where have you been all these years? - In the country? - So I see. - This is Monsieur Fouquet, the King's chief minister. - Monsieur Fouquet, oh, my goodness, what an honor, sir. I never thought to meet so important a man as yourself. - Your servant, sir, your esteemed servant. - Athos, do all courtiers behave so rudely? - They look after themselves, old friend. - Oh, who looks after France? - Aramis, in his way I believe. - I'm afraid I never did like him. Neither did D'Artagnan. - Well, we don't discuss that now, Porthos. Look, there's the King's mother, the old Queen and her lady in waiting, Madame de Chevreuse. - [Porthos] And that, who's that bad-tempered gentleman? - That's Monsieur Colbert, the King's second minister and Fouquet's deadly enemy. - I'm glad he's not my enemy, I must say. - Do you see how Colbert fumes? What a vulgar cockroach the man is. - I have a plan, sir that will establish you forever in the King's favor and crush cockroach Colbert. - You have? - Invite the king to your mansion at Vaux. Flatter him with his own portrait. Astonish him with music and fireworks. Make him feel a king. - I will, My Lord Bishop. What a staunch friend you are. (bugles play) - His sacred majesty, King Louis XIV of France. (esteemed music) - Well, D'Artagnan and where is your old friend Porthos? - Here, your Majesty! God, save your Majesty! - You are welcome, sir, because we know how well you served our father. So what business do we have today? - Monsieur Colbert Seeks a private audience. - In which I hope with the aid of these papers, sire, to prove that Mr. Fouquet has spent millions of your taxes upon his own house at Vaux-le-Vicomte. (crowd gasps) - I am outraged sire and I utterly deny the charge. - Naturally, what else do you say? - Sire, I invite you and your court to be my guests at Vaux, where you may judge my loyalty for yourself. - We accept, astound us, Fouquet. Our court will travel to Vaux. (horses trot) (whimsical music) - Careful, careful, and be see you maintain attention. Careful. - Don't worry, Porthos, you'll be the most fashionable man at Vaux. - Fashionable, he'll be- - Halt, whoever you are, halt. Now, return the needle to me. (whimsical music) Oh, perfect, magnificent. My masterpiece, even I am 83-years-old. (group applauds slowly) - I say, Percerin, can we move? - Monsieur D'Artagnan, you know better than to enter this establishment like a calvary charge. - The fact is we want a new coat for our old friend, Porthos, here. - You've got dozens of coats. - They've all shrunk. - Shrunk, my coats do not shrink, Monsieur Porthos. Gentlemen expand. - All the same, you oblige, eh, Percerin? - Measure this gentleman, two tapes for Mr. Porthos. - Two tapes, one to measure my honor no doubt. - Good old, Porthos, good old boy. - I say, D'Artagnan, I like that green silk over there. - That, Monsieur, is the most expensive material in all Paris or a part of course, from the lengths woven solely for his majesty. - It doesn't look very expensive. - It came from China on the backs of elephants. - Oh good, I'll have it. - What size is Monsieur? (playful music) - 898, chest 360. - Well come on, Percerin, we can bear it. - Waist 482. - Do you want my last tooth to fall out. - Mr. D'Artagnan, a word if I may. - Courage, old boy. - All I can say is phew. - Phew? - One thing that I had forgotten about Paris is that it takes more courage to enter a tailor than to fight a battle. - Monsieur D'Artagnan, elephants may have brought this cloth to France, but I will not ruin it to make a suit for a rhinoceros. - A rhinoceros. - Your friend. - Monsieur Percerin, you are the king of tailors and we obey your every whim. The fact is my dear old, Porthos, so many gentlemen, want new clothes for the fete, that there is insufficient material to cover you. - You mean I've got to wear this old thing? - I'm afraid so. - That's less than I've deserved. - Your devotion to France deserves whatever you want, old friend. - [Porthos] Bravo, Aramis, bravo. - Monsieur Percerin, I have a request from Monsieur Fouquet. He wishes to astonish the king with a portrait. Might the artist come here to sketch his Majesty's new coat, which is already called your masterpiece? - Here it is my Lord, of course your painter may record it for posterity. - Aramis, will you dine with us? - Alas, I cannot, I have religious duties to perform. (dog howls) (tense dramatic music) (prisoners scream) - Shut up, dogs. - What's that? - More of the Bastille's inhabitants. (laughs sinisterly) This is the cell, your honor. - [Fouquet] Wait here. (tense dramatic music) - Who are you, what do you want? - Your name is Philippe is it not? - I remember you, but where from? - Your childhood, when you live with LaCrosse and Perrone at the old manor house. - My childhood, did I have a childhood? - [Fouquet] Is your name, Philippe? - Yes, can you place me? - Yes accompanied the lady who came every month from the Queen. I mean from my benefactor. - Yes, I am Aramis, Bishop of Vaux and how long have you been here? - I am not allowed to speak. - Do you know why you are here? Strange, you are without a mirror. Now, compare your face with this. (tense dramatic music) - Who painted this? How can he know what I look like? - The portrait is not of you, it is of his Majesty, Louis XIV. - The King? - Your brother, sire. - My brother? - Your identical twin. (painting smashes) Everything is explained, is it not? - Yes, everything is explained. - Do you wish to escape from this place? - Yes. - You wish, sire, is my command. (owl hoots) - What you are saying is that one good turn deserves another. What do you want? - A letter of release for a prisoner in the Bastille. - What prisoner? - I Will write in the name. - Impossible. - The prisoner I assure you will not his majesty, the King. - Will you swear to that? Then, I agree. (horse neighs) (engaging dramatic music) - The order is signed by Monsieur Fouquet. Drive on. (horse gallops) (tense dramatic music) Your Majesty, I have dreamed of this moment for many years, yet the choice is yours. I can send you to a safe place where no one will find you and you can live quietly in freedom forever Or if you will apply to me your Chief Minister, I can make you the King of France. I repeat the choice is yours. - You forget that I owe loyalty to my brother. - Your brother, sire listens to evil men. - [Philippe] What evil men. - Fouquet, Colbert, but what France needs is honesty. - Which I can give? - Yes, sire, you can. (engaging dramatic music) - Sir, take to where the throne of France is to be found. (engaging dramatic music) - Sire, It is my honor to welcome the Sun King to my modest chateau. - Thank you, Fouquet. - This way, sire. - Sergeant, post your sentries. - Sir. - This sire is where you will rest the chamber of Morpheus, the God of sleep, who is, you will observe painted on the ceiling. (engaging dramatic music) - [Aramis] Do you see him? - [Philippe] Yes. - Your brother. - Yes. - Study him and all you can for when you take his place. (engaging dramatic music) - Look at him, Fouquet actually believes that he can save himself by groveling. - How can any of save ourselves, Monsieur Colbert, from unexpected fate? - More chicken legs, more wine. (guests banter) (crowd gasps) (crowd applauds gently) - A passable likeness, Monsieur Fouquet. You must do better if your entertainments are to astonish us. - Indeed, sire, our display of ballet and fireworks has been designed to reflect the splendor of Louis XIV the Sun King of France. (crowd banters) (drum rattles) (triumphant orchestral music) (gentle piano music) (intense balletic music) (crowd applauds) - Well done, Colbert, you have proven Fouquet's gifts. No amount of fireworks and splendor can alter his fate. - It is merely my duty, sire. - We will seize his possessions and banish him. He has betrayed our trust, unlike you, our loyal Colbert. - Porthos, for the sake of friendship and our old loyalties, may I swear you to secrecy? - A secret, I will say you may. - France is in danger. Don't ask how, our mission must be accomplished. Will you help me? - Dangerous, eh, you may rely upon me and France may rely upon me also. - Yes, indeed, such loyalty deserves its reward and no doubt the king will make you a duke. - I, a duke? - On my honor. - I'm your man. - Meet me at the cellars at midnight. - At midnight. (engaging dramatic music) (door taps) - Brave work, my Lord. - That is braver. Look, have this. - [Phillipe] My brother's coat. - A copy. A perfect fit. - So, is my brother in his chamber? - He is, your Majesty. (clock strikes) - There, that settles the business of Monsieur Fouquet. We will deal with him in the morning. Now, leave us, we are fatigued. (storm rumbles) (pensive piano music) Do we dream? Where are we? Are we asleep? Who are you? This is treason. We are the King's- (voice is muffled) - Take him away, quickly. Now, your Majesty, perfect. Now, start the mechanism. (machine rattles) - I am the King of France. (engaging dramatic music) - There was a mistake That's prisoner is never to be released. (dark dramatic music) - We are the King of France, you must restore. You fools. Someone will pay, there has been a terrible mistake. Release me, we are the King of France. We are the King of France. We are the King. We are your King. Help! We are the King of France. (engaging dramatic music) Help! We are the King of France. (mice scurry) (triumphant opera music) (jaunty music) - My life is finished, the King ignores me. - Mr. Fouquet, side with me and you will become 10 times as rich as you are now. - [Fouquet] Well, how can that be? - Walk with us and I will tell you what has happened. (engaging dramatic music) - No, never, I am a man of honor. I will not save myself at the price of a crime and who knows of a civil war. - But there are two identical kings. - Captain D'Artagnan. - [D'Artagnan] Sir? - Arrest these men. They have betrayed France. - What, come on now D'Artagnan old boy. We're friends. - Musketeers, arrest these men. (engaging dramatic music) (mice squeak) (chains rattle) - There has been a mistake. This prisoner will be released and come with me. (pensive piano music) Courage, sire, all is not lost. - Your Majesty's mother, Queen Anne and Madame de Chevreuse. - Good morning, mother, I, we trust you slept well. - Very well indeed, thank you Louis. - [Phillipe] Madame de Chevreuse. - Your Majesty, might I say that your Majesty looks particularly refreshed this morning. - We thank you Madame and return the compliment. - Monsieur Colbert. - Monsieur Colbert, good morning, more papers I see. - Your Majesty, more proof against Monsieur Fouquet. - Captain D'Artagnan? - Sire? - Where is Mr. Fouquet? - Sire, he has gone to Paris. - [Philippe] To Paris, why can that be? - [D'Artagnan] On account of some danger against your person, sire. - Danger to a person? What can endanger a person except Monsieur Fouquet? (Colbert chuckles) We do not jest, Colbert. - Where is the Bishop of Vaux? - Sire, Aramis is under arrest. - Under arrest? By whose orders? - Monsieur's Fouquet's. - Release him. We have an important announcement to make concerning our good Bishop of Vaux. - [Guard] Make way for the King, make way. - The King, we are the King. (tense dramatic music) - Well, brother? - Brother? - Mother, acknowledge us as the King. Mother, acknowledge us as the King. (Queen squeals) - Monsieur Fouquet, who is this imposter? - D'Artagnan, which of us is truly the king. (tense dramatic music) - Monsieur, you are my prisoner. - But I trusted you Aramis and you have betrayed me, - [Aramis] Fool. - What? - [Aramis] Fat fool. - I deserve better than that, Aramis, after all these years. - What we deserve, Porthos, is what we get. - Aramis, Porthos, I've pleaded for your lives and the king has granted them, but you'll be exiled forever now, here's someone to say, farewell. - Old friends, how could you do it? - I wanted to be a duke. - I wanted to create dukes. I regret nothing. - As for you, Monsieur Fouquet, do not think that your show of loyalty has impressed us. You have to dismissed. Monsieur Colbert here will take your place. (Queen sobs) - Oh, do stop crying, mother. My punishment is just, mother. I was foolish. I believed that the bishops lies were true. (Queen sobs) Now I must bear it like the king I am. (hammer tolls) (steam rises) - There we are, lads, a mask fit for a king. - Or would be king. (heraldic music) (horses gallop) (engaging dramatic music) Right on time, Boulanger. Kindly have this box taken aboard. We sail immediately. - At once Captain D'Artagnan. (Boulanger whistles) (Philippe groans) Right lads, jump to it, let go forward and go up. Hoist the main fold. (engaging dramatic music) (storm rumbles) (speaks in foreign language) - And what is she, Raoul? (speaks in foreign language) Press on. - Captain Boulanger. - What is this Raoul beget? - Beget, a bomb boat. (speaks in foreign language) - Sacre le bleu. - Monsieur, save us. - And I will lads. - Save us, from what? - A storm's coming near us, I'm putting her about. Take in the old shoal. - Captain, we're changing course. - (speaks foreign language) - The what? - Tis she's a cursed wind you of these shores, all defied by no man. - Hold your course, I say. (speaks foreign language) - Kill him I say and the feather in his hat. - My feather is a badge of honor. (coffin shakes) (speaks in foreign language) - Get off me you big ape. (voice muffled by mask) - Tis a ghost? - Attack him! (engaging dramatic music) (intense action music) (speaks in foreign language) - Gerard Boulanger, be a man, hold your course. - There that way. (tense dramatic music) (storm roars) (Philippe sighs) (melancholic music) - I cannot save you from this imprisonment. Even though on the boat, you saved my life. I am a soldier and I obey my orders. I serve France but never so well as you and by accepting this punishment, I've saved us all from civil war. I must go now to Paris to tell your brother that his will has been done. - D'Artagnan. - I am forever, our Majesty's obedient servant. Long live the king. (water ripples) - Don't leave the King! (melancholic music) (engaging theme music)
