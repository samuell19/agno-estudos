And this is Swifty. I guess we call him a mouth piece. And I am Heather. I just do the driving. It's Breezy. Heather. We're the Akins family. Call her Breezy. - Heather. - Breezy. Hold it. Come here. Where do you guys live? Back the way we came. OK, I want two of you to help me hitch up this trailer. I want the rest of you in the camper, now. Good to go! Home sweet home. OK, where are your folks? I told you they ain't here. If they're not here, where are they? They're just not available. Not in a while. I see six bunks. What's going on here? Our truck's washing away in the red river. That's what's going on. I don't wanna hear another word about that truck. You understand? That smart mouth of your is gonna get you in trouble, boy. We're already in trouble. You don't know anything about being in trouble. I don't find out what you did with my parts, I'm gonna sling all six of you in the state reformatory in Houston. What is the form-story? It's a place for bad little boys. It's a jail. I don't wanna go to no form-story. Me neither. You ain't gonna sling messy-morning in crummy places. That ain't no lie. Me either. Holy shit. It's big John. Don't tell him we told you nothing, mister. Who's big John? Get your asses out here on the double. - Who is big John? - Stay in here, please. Just stay in here. What the hell you got in here? You suppose to strip cars, not steal them. Ain't that same rig you stripped down at over Twellenger station? It's quite of scam you got going, sheriff. Who the hell are you? You should know, you got all my parts. You'll have the hell of the time proving anything. Take a blind judge of your brother-in-law not see what you're up to. Let me waste some John. - Let me lamb blast him. - Shut up Otis. I'm black you fell in to a real thick pile of beans, boy. We got you for... break in and exit at over Twellenger. And the second degree larceny at the diner. Whatever else I can think of. Cuff him. Hey, take it easy. You're gonna read me my right? What about my phone call? Oh, sure. Let me get you a dial tone. Add "resisting arrest" to that list, Otis. I knew I think of something. Ah-ha! - Bingo. - Oh! Whoo-whoo-whoo. Un-dork-a-dee! Whoo-wooh! I need a red seven. Ooh, red seven, come on home to papa. Ah-dee. What you're doing here, boy? Bringing some food for the prisoner. How come? 'Cause he saved my brother's life. That's how come. What you got there? Fruit. Fruit? Let me see that. Ain't one of your tricks, is it? No, sir. Ain't nothing but fruit here. I thought for a second you tried to pull a fast food. How do you like that for a fast food? Easy boy. Take it easy. It's real gun you got there. On your knees, cowboy. You kidding. Oh, my God! You're not kidding. Don't shoot. Please, don't shoot. I'm on my knees. I'm on my knees. See? I can't...I can't do this. I do what he says if I were you, Otis. Are you sure these bullets are real? Wait. Hey, hold it... What you gonna do? You gonna kill me? You know it's not a bad idea, Otis. Lucky for you, I am a non-violent man. Let's go. Holy shit! It's big John. OK, here. Otis! You got in progrip, boy?

OK, pedal it. Come on. I don't get a vote. This is piece of cake, boy. There! How long we got? How long we got for what? - What are you guys uo to, now? - Come on. Break it. Go! Count down ten. Ten. Nine. Eight. We got you, boser. Don't hitch. - Three. - Oh, my God! Two. One. Hey, Lord Almighty! - It's working! - All right! Yeah! All right. Nothing but clear highway behind us. He'll fire us. Whoa! What's with this radio? That thing's been broken for two years. What's the fuck can fix it if it ain't broken. I guess you leaned that by now. Not very much I don't know about car. My Pa was the best mechanic in the west Texas. That ain't no lie. You have a bathroom in here? I did have. I took it out when I put my office in the back. Could you pull over? Little Harry's got to go. Be careful. Slow. OK, go ahead. You're a race car driver, mister? I used to be. I might have been again if I didn't run into you guys. Why you quit in the first place? What happended? He might be in a bad crash. Probably nearly killed his ass. Maybe, he lost his nerve. Nah. It was the booze. Turned in to a slash. Slug, Harry. A no good lousy Alfie. It was a woman. Must be a woman broken his heart. A washed-up, broken hearted, chicken shit, acky bumb. God! What imagination! I don't suppose one of you guys would want to tell me how you start stripping cars, wouldn't you? Our folks were killed in a wreck. And we got kicked out of our house. But, we had to keep eating. So,... Doc stripped a car one night out front of Twellenger. And big John caught us. And set you up in business. - Yeah. - Yeah. Uhuh. So, that's how you became a big time crooks, huh? - Right. - Yeah. You know, you could have called a county authority or something. Wrong. Big John told us he'd bust us up. He says our relatives are all over. Uncle Pete at Spokey. Aunt Harriet at Lentz. And Aunt Ester who I was in a bath to go I can't always she smells. Where? You know why. Heat rotten her feet or something. And nobody or nothing's gonna bust us up. That ain't no lie. - Where're headed? - Shreveport. - Take us there? - Oh, no. I told you Breezy. - Son-of-a-bitch wouldn't listen. - Watch your mouth Shifty. It's Swifty! SWIFTY! You toad sucker. Shut up Swifty. You got to take us to Shreveport, mister. I'm taking you to the next town, period. But, all these small Texas towns are the same. They all just call big John. - Please. - Please. Please. Please. Shreveport. And that's it. - Yeah. - Yeah. Good. Still beating. So, wake me up when we got to Shreveport. I don't wanna miss nothing. Hee-hee yah! Whoa! Wait for it. Whoa! Come on, guys. Don't look at me like that. Now, we talk about this. You're gonna spend the night in a motel... and tomorrow morning... you go down to the bus depot, four blocks away, you take your bus anywhere in the world you want to go. I'm trying to get back in the race after two years. That requires a 100% concentration. I don't need one thing to distract me. Let alone six. Whoa! What are we gonna do, now? All right party. Hey, Brewster! How're you doing? Oh, yeah. What's up Doc? Watch it cowboy. - Howdy, Bug. - Oh, oh, oh. Oh, you always have an interesting way of saying 'hello'. As I remember, you never particularly dislike my 'good-bye' either. Well, one thing I can say about you when you say good-bye,... you mean good-bye. Sorry about that. I don't know what happened. Ms. Lilah. Would you OK this check, honey? Yeah, sure, Eddie. I can't tell you how many time I want to just pick up the phone... Hey, Brew, you're gonna win tomorrow? I'm gonna try. My life was so screwed up that day, you know? - Just... I couldn't... - Hey, Brewster! Come on over. I'll be there in a minute. No, I guess what I'm trying to tell you. Come on, Brew. Why don't you go be with the boys? And I'll talk to you later, OK? - Hey, Bug? - Hmm? I got better idea. I relly have missed you, you know? - Here. - All right. I got it. Give me half-inch. - Here. - Beautiful. Give me another half-inch. Louis, go get those tires over there. Come on. Start the clock, Harry. A car's coming. A car's coming. There cupping wheeler. - Someone is coming. - All right. Slow him down. OK, what's the up time? Ten, nine, eight... - What's that? - Whoa! Hey! - Fire! - We're gonna tell someone. - Hey, let's have another pitcher up here. - Hey, a fire out there. - Fire? - What? Fire? Come one. Time! Time. - Doc, they're coming. - You got the tires? - There's wild bash... - You're not gonna make it. Just give me ten seconds. Jesus! Here. Give me a hand. Come on. It sure is lucky that fire didn't get near our cars. Or we all will be running around that track tomorrow. How did it get started? Probably, some drunk cowboy put the button in the dumpster. Well, excuse us boys, but... this man needs a good meal and a place to lay his pretty head. Yeah, excuse us boys. - Put its main frame - Right. And you left six kids in the middle of nowhere? No, I wouldn't call a motel middle of nowhere. What you expect me to do? I don't know. If they were my kids, I really wouldn't appreciate if somebody just... Honey! They're not your kids, honey. I know. And certainly, not my kids. My God, can you imagine people on the road with six kids? I can't even take care of myself. Yeah, well, I know that. Look at me. Do I look like a father to you? Uh-huh. Maybe, because you look like everything to me. Hey, Brew! Wake up. I'm coming. - Our cars had been stripped. - What? They got Stan's new tires, they got my gearbox, they got Hank's carburetor. - I'll be right out. - Brew. You've been hit real bad. Be right out. Yes, I know-I know the same little bastards to try to get even with me. Brewster? I've ever found the skunk who'd done it, I'm gonna bend monkey wrench over his brain pan. Well, whoever ripped us off is half way to New Orleans by now. I don't know about you guys, but... if I don't hustle up some parts, I'll be watching this race from the stands. See you guys later. - All right, Brewy. - So long, Brew. What the hell you think you're doing? We just thought we got your car back in shape before we left. At the least we can do. I don't suppose it daunts on you, people are making a living on these? I mean, what if somebody stole your partools? Someone once did. Oh, when these guys find out what you've done. They'll never know it was you. Those stupid son-of-a-bitch aren't that smart. So far as they know, you got stripped too. Look guys. - Breezy. - Heather. You guys were gonna leave last night. Adios, good-bye, farewell. That was our deal, remember that? We don't make deal with ex-cons. We all only try to help. Well, can't give the parts back. Maybe, I can sell them to get the guys some money somehow. So, out. Every body out. Could you at least take us to the interstate? We can hitch from there. I'll take you to the interstate. But, I gotta get rid of these parts first. Over here. We know. Yeah. Just so you don't get any idea. Hey, Clarence! Hey, hey, Brewster! Hey, man, where you've been hiding? I got some parts for you. Hey, that's good. I can always do for parts for me. They're out on my van. You wanna help me get them? Sure. Hey, come on in while I get my keys. Where've you been hiding? I haven't seen you in a long time. We were you racing in the Baton Rouge those years. I heard about your crash? It probably scared me more that hurt me. Don't you get in a race after that? I almost did. I went out to California. I just ran around on somebody dirt track out there and... Little bastards. You got anything else I can drive? Nope. I just sell parts. I ain't got no whole car. I catch you later, Clarence. I gotta find the way to track and fast. Clarence! Can you give me a hand over here? Clarence. I got a funniest feeling, he's gonna need that. Hey, thanks. - How about a ride to the track? - Sure, hop in. Dog don't bite. He's friendly. We got a race coming up here folks. The best cars, the best drivers, the fastest qualified... - Turn it off. - in time we ever had. Why, they sure came through for you there. What Lilah sees in you, I'll never know, Brewster. Hey, Brew. Whay do you pay your crew with, all day suckers? - Hold it. - Hold it. Hey, Brewster. What do you think? Hot, huh? I think you guys are gonna get us all killed. Well, when you see those cars parked in them crates there, we just naturally thought you want to get started as soon as possible. See how you got your race coming up pretty quick, right? Yeah. You see now your car got screwed up like Hogen's goat? Yeah. You mean you guys have those parts crated in here? We did have things come in as ordered. The driver let me sign. I said I was your daughter. And nobody else asking any questions? There was some comment about you and someone named Lilah. Who's Lilah? Lilah's friend of mine. That's what we figured. Come on, Brew. Why don't you take her out for qualifying? Yeah. You said you want to make a come back. This car is hot. I'll say it is. If you have, Brew, you got a chance. Besides, you can use the prize money to pay back your buddies. He ain't gonna do it. I know he wouldn't do it. Yellow belly, gutless slob. Okay. Once and for all, I'm gonna show you guys stripping cars and fish bite fall in Arkansas, won't make it in a Louisiana track. All right. Out of sting. I like to direct your attention to the track now. We got car number fourty-nine, coming out on the track. The driver, owner, Brewster Baker, back on the circuit after two years out of competition. Let see if Baker can qualify on his first attempt from the come back trail. The best time of two laps. Well, Baker seems to very determine as he gets the green flag... Baker is driving a Chevy Camaro. - Yeah. - Come on. High bid of qualified time under 18 seconds. Time for Brew Bake's first lap, 15.42 seconds. That would ensure his spot in the starting line up. Coming up, Baker's second flag now... Oh, Baker's qualified time is 17.38 seconds. He'll be starting back in the pack, but at least, he qualified. On the track now is car number 101. The driver is Alvin Crowe, a consistant winner here at Shreveport. - How did she run? - It's OK. That would qualify fifteen in the field of twenty. All right. - Change the gear, we're running too high. - We're running the five-ten now. Make it five-eighteen. Give it two bounds left in left rear. The race starts in 30 minutes. Come on. Get ready for the start of Dixie 100 folks, the feature race here at Shreveport. The cars will take one lap before the green flag. It's freak day for racing and freak field of cars and drivers. You got Harley Crommer Nipol with Stan Johnson next to him. And it would count upon the green flag, folks, we're about to get under way. And there's the green glag. And the race is on. Johnson in car number thirty, Keith Toricalvin in car number one. Ron Dawson in car number twenty-eight. Time? 18.2 seconds. Car number 101 got the big challenge by Stan Johnson in car number 30. Ok, Crowe in car number 101 is still in first place. Johnson in car number 30 in second. But, he is being challenged in every turn by Ron Dawson in car number 28. Quickley in the 17 car in fourth. Joe's driving the Pontiac number 53 in fifth. Ron Dawson takes the lead. Time? 54.9 seconds. Folks, this is gotta be the most exiting Dixie 100 in history. Brewster Baker in car number 49 has been moving up to the field. He's now standing seventh. Leslie Fermit car number 18 is trying to get the grip on sixth place. Three cars are out of the race. Yes, the twin Rick Jones and Rick Berk all out of the race. There's the green flag. We have four laps to go. It's Johnson in the lead, Dawson in second, and Crowe in third. And here is the surprise. Brewster Baker is up there with the leaders in fourth place. An incredible ride for the man on the come back trail. And we cross the finish line. Johnson has won here at Dixie 100. Dawson takes second and Crowe third. Baker is in fourth, Palansy in fifth. What and exciting race folks! And none of the drivers in the freeway track was injured, ladies and gentlemen. Great Brew. Son-of-a-bitch did pretty good, didn't he? Did pretty good. Fourth place, you call that pretty good? You were great Brew. You were sure fantastic. Thanks. Hey, guys! Hey, you won Stan. Sure got tire of chasing your ass's bit. Hey, fourth ain't bad. How did he expect? Here you go guys. All right. Pay day. You know, it could have been a lot more if I hadn't had paid those guys back for those parts you stole. What they have said? You guys are damn lucky, they didn't call police on you too. It fells good having little green in the pocket, doesn't it? The liile mind ties down. Where's your gear? It's inside. Don't you think you better get it? Brewster, you ain't gonna leave us here. Yeah, he's leaving, Harry. But, Brewter, we got to stay with your car. Hold it. Shreveport was the end of the line. That was our deal. And he keeps his deal. - Howdy Bug. - Hi. Just come looking for you and say 'so long'. He's good at that. Breezy, this is the Lilah we've been talking about. - Hi, Heather. - Hi. Hey, you guys want the iceream cones before you leave? - These kids are good machanics. - Humm. I know. Hey, what did you say your relatives are from? All over. Eight chocolate chips, please. Make mine a banana split. Add some large nuts, please. Any other guys want banana split? Oh, come on, guys. Cheer up. Hey, I got an idea. I'll take you to the airport, put you on an airplane, buy you tickets to see your relatives. You know, I'm really jealous of these guys. - They got to go to Hawai. - No shit, Dick Tracy. I bet that's the same mouth you eat out of. Here's your cones. Banana split will be ready in a minute. - OK. - Seven-eighty. Nah, just keep the chance. Here you go. Brewster, don't you want to stay with us? Well, I like to, Harry. But, what I'm gonna do with six kids? I'm not father material. Tell him, Bug. You're doing just fine. We ain't get wait neither. Get the hell out of here. We'll find our own way. Come on. Let's get our stuff. Wait a minute. Does that mean you don't want me to take you to the airport? At least, the son-of-a-bitch can hear. Hey, guys. Come on. I'm really trying to help you. Tell him Bug. - Shove it, mister. - Don't you talk to her that way. He's talking to you, mister. Oh, hell with you guys. Find your own way. The airport is out of my way anyhow. I'll call you later, Bug. You no good, rotten, washed up, fork tongue, black hearted, double dealing, backstabbing, alci bum! Ok. It's OK. We could've been great together. All right, all right. All right, all right. Every body is doing OK. Hey, Brewster. I think I know what your trouble is. What's that? Well, your caburetor ain't harden, your generator ain't in it, and your piston ain't... well, it ain't working either. That's real cute. How did those kids do this thing. Oh, no. It can't be. Welcome to your nightmare. Look, who's back. Bob Barker and the boys. We got no choice but to stick with you till the better thing turns up. It's only way we can stay together. And Lilah agreed. - Oh, Lilah agreed? - Uhuh. You want to correct her style. She sends her regard. She does, huh? What do you think? Give us a chance to get this car going? - Please. - Please. Please. Please. Please. Please. I can give you piecing like old times. Last week's old times? Look, guys, if I do this. It's under one condition. Nobody touches another's driver's car. I want no five finger discount, understand? It's easy. No problem. - Terk, can I take your picture? - Yeah, go ahead. Ahah hah. Well,... If it isn't the famous Brewster Baker. A bunch of midget for the pit-crew. Hey, sorry, Brew. I mean it's saddest thing I've ever seen in my life. If you want the money, all you have to do is ask, you know? The check book way. To see my old boss come to, uh, something like this. Kiss off, mister. You did very well down at Shreveport. Like easy pop to what? Fourth? Huh? Must have been a lot of dead meat in that race. Kick his ass, Brewster. Don't take that shit from this fungus faced toad sucker! I'd tell the little punk there that, uh... he shouldn't be talking to me like that if I were you. He's right, Swifty. Be polite. Mr. Logan here's a very sensitive man. On second thought, I got a good mind to turn this little kid loose and let him just whip your ass, Terk! That's funny, Brew. Yeah, that's real funny. That's good one. You know what? I'd look out tomorrow if I were you. 'Cause I'm gonna be out on that track. Just waiting for you to screw up. Just once. If... you qualified, that is. Hey, Terk. Shove it. Who the hell is he? I don't think he lies you much. He don't like anything much. He don't like winning, he don't like loosing,... and you're right, he don't like me. What did you do to him? Nah, it's not what I did to him. It's what he did to me. See, he was my chief mechanic for a year. But, what he really wants to do is drive. So, he told my sponsors I was loosing my stuf. And he played around with my car a little bt too. You didn't know? Not until it was too late. He rigged my breaks till it deak two years ago. I crashed into the wall. So, my sponsors dropped me and conveniently picked up Mr. Logan. That's one bad dude. He's real bad. Shit. He don't scare me. Oh, he don't, huh? Well, just the same we're gonna stay away from the Terk, aren't we guys? - Breezy? - Heather. Aren't we? - Yeah. - Yeah. Oh, yeah, Brewster. You know you're gonna need a new set of heads. You got a hair line crack in yours. That's two thousand dollars. We can make through another race with those. All right. I know you guys may think that grown men should not be frighten. I tell you, I was scare to death. It was the fastest I had ever driven in my life. And we were side by side. And old Billy Flint crashed through the wall... and was sailing out in this lake. And in this dark murky water, that we all knew had an alligator in it. Alligators. Then there come old Billy Flint, just to gurgle in for air. And they stop the race. Holy shit! Then up come this man eater... jumping up with the head the size of a shovel... and the body the size of washing machine. I mean this mother was big. And there was a big swirld of black water. That was the last we ever saw... of poor Billy Flint. You know what we did find when we pull his car out of the mud? What, Brew? We found alligator teeth the size of cut silver dollars embedded in the fender. And no tires. I mean that alligator was so mean, he ate the damn tires. - Yuck! - Yuck, man! You know what? I bet that's why they made handbugs out of alligators from this part of the country. I don't get it. Because of their rubber content. That's what make them water proof, - you goons. - Ah, we know you're crazy. I don't be lieve that. - You guys,... - Ready for bed, every body. - How do you...? - You guys believe everything. - Guys. - Good night, Brew. Good night guys. - You need to be cool. - I love it. Nothing better than a bunch of suckers. - Brew? - Yep. Have you talked to Lilah, lately? Yeah, why? I don't know. She's just real nice. Good night. Good night, Breezy. Hey, Brewster! Hi, Loni. I miss you around here. You miss anything in this place. Ha! They don't make them like you any more, cowboy. I notice that. And make me hungry. Yeah. Younger and cheaper. You do anything later? Yeah, I'm makeing phone calls. You kidding me? Well, if you change your mind. You know where to find me. Hey! You're the famous Terkitch. Well, you've found him. That me. My name is Bobby E. Lee. Thay named me after the General. Yeah? Tell me. What a pretty thing like you doing in here this time of night? Bobby E. Lee. Well, it's just so hot and muggy out tonight... and I was just dying for a cool drink. And I spotted you under the car there looking so hot yyourself. And I said "Bobby Lee, you ought to accept what for a cool one". Well now, this is my lucky night. Let's say, uh... we go to my trailer. I mean, we'll pour a few beers and... I'll show couple of things that I got. - Ive seen you drive. - Yeah? Yeah. And I like the way you shift your gears. I bet the girls can't keep their hands off you. Enough of the Terk to go around, girl. Hmm, that's for sure. You stand here and watch the door. Here it is. He had the manifold, Doc. Stupid son of a bitch is just making it easy. Give me a five-eight. All clear. That's one hell of the tattoo. Yeah. Bobby E. Lee. Uh-huh. It's cute name. What was that? I didn't hear nothing. Well, I did. I didn't hear nothing, except the beat of my own heart. I better go check it out. Why don't you... check me out instead? I do like what I see. Well, I just... help you out this little thing, huh? Why don't I... help you... out? Be my guest. I'm waiting, girl. Why don't we... go back there? I think that's good idea. Watch out. A mirror above the bed? I just can't believe my good fortune. - What's that? - Huh? What the hell... Ow, God... Damn! Damn. Go to the bathroom? You want a soda? - No. - No. You go to bed? Shit. I thought you guys were going to bed when I left. Where did you go? We've been out. - To movie. - Bowling. Yeah, we were at the movies. - Yeah, we were just... - Oh, really? What movie did you see? - Strong Man. - Dracula. Don't give me that crap. You don't get dirty hands going to the movies. Where have you been? And just where the hell have you been? You suppose to be here taking care of these kids. Breezy, come back here. What are these guys doing out this time of night? That boy is seven years old. He has no business... - Damn it, Breezy, I'm talking to you. - Don't yell at me. What we do is our business. - What you... - Brewster, don't be mad. You guys go inside.

You've ever done anything you're ashame of? It's just... I got thing inside of me... I can't stop, probably. Like what? Last night, when I was walking... I didn't even think about the boys. Not once. I kept thinking about myself. I want... I want to be with kids my own age. I want to go to high school. I want a boyfriend. I want... Oh, you'll think it's dumb. Oh, I don't know. Try me. I want... I want to be a cheerleader. I don't think it's dumb at all. Still don't want to lose those time. Those're good time alright. Do you think that's selfish? Nobody who has ever seen you with those kids... would accuse you of being selfish. Brew? If I really run away last night,... would you be taking care of the boys? I don't know, Heather. Well, at least, you know my name. In our 50-lap race with 35 cars all over the south, And now back, action on the track. Buck Carter in car number 19 and Ralp Barnes got tangled up on that back stretch and now, we're under a caution. This Biloxi track always seems to provide it share of thrills.

It's only a matter of laps before he blew it. Sure enough. Boom! You go back there, young man. What is wrong with you guys? Who the hell am I talking to? But, Terk's rat, Brew. Hey, stealing is stealing, Pal, and I don't want to be any part of it, OK? I don't wanna beat Terk... unless I am the best driver with the best car. Not by cheating. As for you, young lady.

Great round, Brewster. Did you ever expect you'd be back in big time racing so soon? Yeah, Carl. I didn't do it all by myself. Beleive me, I got a lot of help.

And good morning, ladies and gentlemen. We're at the 22nd run of the Atlanta 500. Temperature is right now at the high 70's, sky partly cloudy. John, it ought to be a perfect day for racing, and from behind the scene's drama, we have an ineresting development in the pit, right now. Uh, most unusal story in years. Brewster Baker, who's been off the circuit for two years, has been burning up the smaller tracks for the last four months with the help of the pit crew kids. Kids! Sixteen to seven. And we're gonna down in the garage area, have an interview with them, right now. Brewster Baker and the Six Pack. Congratulations to the Six Pack for qualifying seventh. Thanks. Is Brewster Bake here? I like a word with him. No. He, uh... had to go... go shake the doo off his lily thing. He had to what? Umm, he had... he had to take a piss. And that's the story from down here in the garage area. Back to you in the booth. Well, there you have it John. Race hasn't even started yet, and Baker is already in for a piss stuff. All of the cars that finished their NASCAR's inspection, ladies and gentlemen. And the reverend Bill Bayes is at the beautiful chapel service in the garage area where most of the drivers and the race officials were friends. May I have your attention, please. Will all of the crew chiefs move their cars to the sarting positions on Pit road. Also, all drivers please report to the competition director, Bill Gazerway, in the drivers' lounge at 11:30 AM. Number one. We have 500 miles of car driving in historical today, folks. But for the moment, we got some really pretty thing to look at. I refer to the beautiful racing queens, Watson Mayhew and her corner of lovely young ladies while waiting. In that hole where Brew laid, it looked like socket in the pulled tooth. Yeah, he probably searched trying to figure out how did he got that nod on his head. What the hell? Little midgets try to bluffing. He ain't there. On the pos, from Mooresville, North Carolina, Dale Earnhardt. Lining in the second spot, from Chesapeake, Virginia, young Ricky Rudd. Starting in third, from Hyattsville... Hey, Fred! We don't have the driver here. He's coming. I told you, he'll be here. - He better be... - Two minutes. OK, you got your two minutes. Then we'll move this car off this lane. From North Carolina, Richard Petty. Guys, I think it's time we ask the Lord his spirit. I don't think he's gonna show. Lord? As you know, we ain't been good at all. We stole car parts and we used bad language. You see now, we met a very good man, Brewster. The Lord knows that. Just tell him to get here quick. Brew! Come on, come on. Brew, come on. Brew! Get my belt. To all personels, please, clear the pit road. Let's race in before the start of this race. All personels, please, clear the pit road. - Yeah. Hi Breezy. - Oh, there's Pete. - Hi, guys. - Hi, Breezy. Gentlemen, start your engines. The starters are getting them under way but high price cars. A fourty car field of the best, the fastest drivers in NASCAR grand national racing. They're moving off down pit road A beautiful deployed field of the supervision of the starter, Harold Cander. We got the official count on today's attendants,... fifty five thousand, four hundred and sevety two. At 5th gear, 60 miles an hour, these cars appear to be crawling. Now, the race cars move down over the fourth turn bunny. And it looks like we're gonna have a starter. And we have a starter. Now at turn 1 with Dale Earnhardt in the lead. Ricky Rudd's right there beside him, and the others are packed inside. Oh, what a great start for this group of 500! It's Earnhardt, Kahne, and Ricky Rudd running one, two, three. After that, we get Baker, Logan, and Bill Elliott behind. There they are now. They are all headed toward the turn number 3. Oh, we got a fume... Yes, that's car needs Sailor with the blown engine. That's the first fleg in the afternoon. The drivers all hold their positions right now while the dragon is cleared. Too bad for Silor. Out so soon. He's moving up! He's moving up! We're headed at 187 flag, but if you check your score... Now the back stretch, we had car 46. That's Ricky Round blowing the engine. The rest of the field maneuvering around Ricky as we go to a yellow flag. You're gonna see all of the cars checking in the pits now, while Round's car being pulled out from the track. That's tough break for Ricky Round. Look like Brewster Baker taking on right side rubber and fuel at very fast band pit time Sam Pinsky at that corner manage Baker's Six Pack for this race. And believe you me, they're doing a great job And also it's giving him a great boost by his Hawaii traffic crew. And now Logan and Baker both move ahead a couple of notches. And to the 4th and 5th spots with Logan having a slight edge. But the leader is Harry Gant with Theodore Art in the 15 car challenging. Buddy Baker in the number 1 car has started as they move through the slow traffic. It has time for that last lap for 37 seconds flat. Here's Baker in the Ford and Logan in the Buick And they seem to put up with each other. They move up along later At this point, ladies and gentlemen, you got only six cars now in the lead lap, all the rest of the field are one lap down. Adn you got seven starters who are no longer in this race. But, you can count n one thing. And that is that all seven other drivers will be competing at talent they got just two week's rpoblem today. We have 10 laps to go folks. And this is close as they come. Buddy Baker is still the man to beat. But his lead is getting shorter every turn by the number 3 car of Ricky Rudd. And tucked in right behind the two leaders are cars number 73, the Hawaii tropic Buick driven by Terk Logan and the 47 T-Bird of Brewster Baker. The lead changes hand on turn number 3. But, now the uno car's back again. The two leaders bumped on the front straight away. They bump again and again. Wait a minute, we have a terrible crash. Ricky Rudd slammed into the wall. Car number 94 truck kicks Rudd from the rear. Brewster Baker and Terk Logan who were running 3rd and 4th are now the leaders as they are called in to the pits. Come on in Brew.You're not tired. We're gonna win it. Only Baker and Logan are in the lead lap. So, the race is between Baker's Ford T-Bird and the Buick of Logan. That was probably the worst crash we ever had here at this speedway. But luckily, none of the drivers involved in this crash got hurt as far as we can see. Where are Breezy and Doc? We're gonna win it Brew! Come on, let's go! Let's go! Where the hell are the kids? Damn it! That sheriff got them, Brew. He's taking them back to Texas. Just go now. Go Brew! Do you get it what? Go, damn it! That's an order! Terk Logan is down off the jack and there he goes. Now, Baker is in the way. He's catching up to Logan right over... He makes a hard left turn, cutting off Logan who plowed into the pit wall. Both leaders are out of the race. We're gonna find out what happened? Brewster! Brewster, come on. Not this time, boy. I'm in charge of my chargees. - I want those kids, sheriff. - I just bet you do. I'm on my way to Baker's car now. I'll be there in a minute. Well, I got the red warrant from the state of Texas and extradition papers from the state of Georgia. pardon me, officer. Brewster, what makes you take that wrong turn? Well Chris, I don't think I took the wrong turn. I tell you, this sheriff here is from the same hometown as my Six Pack. And he has driven all the way from texas to arrest these six harden criminals here. How about that, sheriff? Look, I'm...I'm a Texas law officer. I don't have to talk in front of no damn camera. Ask one of the kids. They'll tell you what is going on? That sounds like a gret story. How about some comments, sheriff? Can we talk about this in private somwhere? Oh, there is no need to do that, sheriff. We are on network TV with the good chance that the Governor of Texas and... the good people who elected you to office are watching. And now is your chance to explain to them why you come here to arrest these six little kids. Well, we-we didn't come here to arrest them exactly. - Can I say 'Howdy' to the folks back home? - Shut up, Otis. Well, what did you come for? Well,... we-we were sent to-to check on them. - Yeah. - To check on them? Yeah. See, these children are rophans. We have to make sure they have proper supervision. Well, I can see they're getting that. So, I'm very proud to report to the good people of the great state of Texas that these children are in the capable hands of mister... Brewster Baker. No shit, Dick Tracy. Hey! Whoa! Whoa!
