Evening, Sir. Here. Save up for school. Five hundred? We can't save up with this. You're stingy! Take that. Hey! Watch your mouth! Damn. Come back here! Give me back my money! Happy? Relax, dammit! That one's kinda cute. Saying someone's cute when you're still a virgin. Stop it. Hey! My friend wants to say hi. Stop it! Damn you. You wouldn't dare, would you? Just quit it, man. Let's take turns driving. - I don't want to. - Just hurry up! Don't be so lazy. Damn, why is your ass so pointy? Your ass is! Did you just fart? A little. You little shit. Look, your place. Shut up. Sissies will be sissies. Don't be shy. You lost your virginity to one of them right? Yeah, yeah. Don't be like this. Drive. Drive! I'm scared. You just said I'm one of them. Where are you headed? Take me with you. We can go for a threesome. Take that. I'll give you a package deal. Full service. Front or back is fine. He actually likes it from behind. Front, back, I can do them all. Of course you can. What do you say, sweetie? How dare you guys! Your jokes are not funny. Just admit that you're still a virgin. Fuck you. Hey dummy. Make proper notes, I want your writing to be readable. Okay. I'm bored. Let's skip class. But how do we do it? Don't worry. Look! There's a naked lady! Dammit. Such a genius. Ma'am. May I go to the toilet? Look at that fool. He's peeing in the field! Look at your crazy boyfriend! He's not circumsized! No, he is. That's why it's tiny! That poor child. He must have been under the influence. Hey, where are you going? Classes aren't dismissed yet. Come on, Sir, it's like you've never been young. Take it easy, man. Where do you think you're going? Hey, where are you going? See you tomorrow! I haven't seen you in a while. - I've missed you. - Me too, baby. Lies. I swear, I've been busy at work. Working hard or hardly working? Working hard, baby. My CDs are here! You never have the time for me. Then what's this? For you, right? Awesome. Baby, I gotta go back to work. Don't forget to call me. Of course. Take care, baby. Bye. - Look at this. Not bad, eh? - Not bad. Hi babe, the new CDs are not bad. Yeah, but we don't have cash right now. Can we pay by the end of the month? No. You want it, you gotta pay for it. Come on, don't be like that with your own friend. Do you not trust us? We'll give you something else as a promise. - Yeah. - Like what? How about if the two of you... ...kiss in front of me? - Ew, no. He would love it. - Shut up you little shit. Take my shoes. Another pair of dirty shoes? Look over there. Not enough. Fine. I'll give you everything I have. Including my dignity. Come on. Please? Please. Just like that. Where do we go next? Let's go find something to drink. Hey! Happy now? Next time I want to see both of you naked. If it's with you, I'd love to. Me too. But if it's with you, you'd be hard. Yours is tiny, it won't turn me on. Shut up, I'm bigger. What's bigger is only your ball sack. Fuck you! Faggot! Faggots... What's wrong? Like what you see? Pang, just take it easy. What's so funny? Hey asshole, are you trying to pick a fight? I'd rather work or be a whore. Instead of fighting you. - You're the one picking a fight. - Damn. I'm gonna kill you! Okay friend, see you later. Where do you think you're going? I'll come with you. Finish them! Don't run, asshole! Don't run! Why are you running away too? - I haven't been working out. - Hey! Faggot! Come here! Don't run! Sorry, Miss. What are you doing? Making me lose focus. It takes a long time to concentrate. Both of you... - He did it first. - It's Ipang, Mom. - Afternoon, Auntie. - You guys smell. Why are you undressed like this? The car's aircon stopped working. So you undressed. Are you crazy? I think you need to take him to the doctor. Look, he forced me to undress. Ouch. Stop sucking up to my mom. - She smells nice. - Hey! I have a patient this evening, try to keep it down, okay? Stop! You're a mess! You seem very tense lately. Control your tempo. This is an old song, isn't it? You're still playing badly. We're playing exactly like we did, nothing has changed. Then don't play exactly like you did. What song are we playing? We only have one. There, you know. Let's do it again. Come on. Stop stop stop! You're overdoing it. Don't try to outshine others. We're a band, you're not solo. How am I overdoing it? You never come in properly. Nugi? Nugi? Eat that. I'm leaving. The dinner is there you just need to heat it up. Don't practice for too long. You have school tomorrow. Okay! - Bye! - Bye, Auntie. Have fun! Enough, let's wrap up for today. What? - Shut up. - You shut up. Man, you need to face reality. Your mom is still young. She's pretty, and she's straight. It's normal that she has a boyfriend. It's none of your business. She must have needs. Just like us. But for us... Fuck you. Don't talk dirty about my mom. She is not you. See. You still can't accept the truth. - Your mom must have needs... - I will hit you. Say that again and I will hit you. Have some respect. That's my mom. Okay. Well if I were your mother I wouldn't be able to hold it in... Honey. Tell Ipang to study. And turn off his tape. It's noisy. Okay, one sec. You keep studying. If you're too diligent, no girl would like you. Really? I'm telling you. When I was your age, I have kissed all the girls in class. - Cool huh? - Are you serious? Of course, then the next year... ...I was able to kiss all the girls in school! Isn't that cool? Even the teachers? Of course not! She stinks. I haven't even kissed one. But I like this one girl in my class. But she doesn't even see me. Is she pretty? She's pretty! Make a move starting tomorrow. But how? Why aren't you studying? I already did. What did you study? I was teaching Dido. About... biology. Biology? Elementary students don't study biology. Dido? What are you doing? Good morning. Good morning, Ma'am! Today, we'll be having an oral examination. Ugh, what a bitch. You will be tested one by one based on the attendance list. What subject is this? As if it would make any difference. Silence! This is not a concert! You don't need to shout like that! Understood? Okay. I will give you 15 minutes to reread your notes. But after that... All your notes should be put on my desk. Understood? Yes, Ma'am. Ma'am, Jerry is having a seizure! What is it? What is it? Do it properly, you dumbass. What's happening to Jerry? Let us take him to the clinic, Ma'am. This happens often, it's in his blood. Yes we'll take care of him. Nobody is here. That is heaven on earth. That's why you shouldn't study too much. You'll lose your mind. Only sissies like to study. Are you a sissy? - No. - Good. Einstein, Darwin, and Newton got nothing. If we see girls like these, the earth's gravitation can change. Understood? He doesn't get it, dummy. Listen. When you die, no one is gonna ask you about the theory of relativity. But you will regret it if you die without indulging in these. Awesome, huh? I hope I live a long life. What the hell? You sissy. She's here! Scatter! Fake a seizure again! - Come on, take care of it. - No, this was your idea! Just hurry! Hey, what do you think you're doing here? I looked for you at the clinic and you weren't there. Why didn't you come back to class? Jerry is getting worse. We were about to take him home and now he has trouble breathing. Thanks to Nugi, he's gonna give CPR. We don't want Jerry to die. Come on, Nugi. Hurry up, Nugi. Ugh, your breath stinks. Come on Nugi, do it! Nugi, why are you blowing on his mouth? Are you trying to fool me? You do it. I can't. I have asthma, Ma'am. Do it. Hurry! Quickly! Did you not brush your teeth? It's how he smells. Quickly! He's dying. So you both have kissed a guy? Shit. Don't yell at me! - Sorry. - Look at you. The hell are you yelling for? So what's it like? Addictive? Ipang loves it. It was his idea. You sissy. - Me? It was you! - You started it. Come on, don't make me hit you. Did you use your tongue? You just love making us the object of your fantasy, don't you? Well, why not? It was actually Ipang's fantasy, kissing a guy. Fuck you! Just admit it! I got into this because of you. I am straight. Did you lose your virginity to a girl or a guy? Hmm, no wonder your ass is huge. Hey, tell your friend to hire our band if there's a gig. Okay. If we make it big, you can be one of the groupies. I would do it now. If you wanna be a groupie, you need to sleep with one of us. Yeah. - Hell no. - Hell yes! So pick one, me or Ipang? I wonder who. Pick me. I am 3 cm longer than Ipang. Your ball sack's diameter is 3 cm. Ew, no what the hell. Did you really measure it? Just for comparison. You are both disgusting. I gotta go. Wait, answer it first. Who would you pick? Take a picture and send it to me. I would win. Mine looks better in photos compared to yours. Yours is like a jungle, it's like a bush. I would definitely win. You spit on me. Hey asshole! Why did you spit on me! Come down here! Sorry, dude! You're the idiot, why did you stand there? Not my fault. Come down here! You come up here! - Enough. - Wait there! I'll wait til tomorrow! Let's just go, I'm not in the mood. Don't worry, let's just wait. He's skinny after all. There he is! You take care of that. Don't pretend like you know me, okay. - Hey asshole! - You're an asshole. Shut up, asshole! Don't try to run. Who's running? I'm not afraid. You can't mess with us. - Why are you dragging me into this? - Hey, assholes! Watch your mouth, or I'll fuck your mom! Don't bring my mother into this. I hate being friends with you. It's just a punch. Just a punch? If you're trying to fight, keep me out of it. Act like I don't know you. - I still want to live. - You upset? Another fight? Don't you have a more creative hobby? If something happens to you, I won't be paying for the hospital bills. Now go and get ready. We're having dinner with my friend. Gotta go. Say hi for me to your future dad. Here's your tea. Where have you been? Got into another fight? It's nothing. Nothing? Have a seat. - Look at you. - I'm fine, Mom. What are you actually doing? You're flunking at school. What is it that you want? What, you wanna just play with your band and pick fights? Hmm? I would rather have you prioritize school. Instead of focusing on your band, aimlessly. Aimlessly? What do you mean aimless? It has nothing to do with it. - Fights are normal. - What do you want to be? You want to just play music for all your life? Yes. And it's not "just". What your father is saying that being in a band is fine... ...as long as you stay in school. No, Mom. He hates it when I play music. Look, whenever there is a problem... ...he always relates it to the band. Right, Dad? Right. I don't like you playing music. What kind of dream is being a musician? Hear that, Mom? - It's not that... - I've had enough. I'm tired of hearing this. Where do you think you're going? Ipang! Paul and I are thinking of making our own aromatherapy shop. Paul is really skilled at making aromatherapy for medication. He studied in India. Right, Paul? Yes, I was learning how to meditate. But I ran out of money, so I started working at a shop that sells aromatherapy for medication. So you were a laborer. - Nugi. - Yes. You can say that. Paul, would you like some more salad? This is my special recipe. I added mint to clear the mind. Sure, why not. Paul is a vegetarian like me. Goats are, too. That's true, but I don't eat living things. Well I don't eat animals alive. I eat them in the form of satay. Sure, why not. You say that all the time. So your hobby is being in a band? Sorry, not a hobby. It's a dream. Nugi, be polite. I'm leaving. Nugi! - Sorry, Paul. - It's okay. So you want to be a musician? I believe that one day you will be a famous musician. I want to be like you. You're awesome. Awesome what? You can kiss all the girls in school. I can't even kiss one. I couldn't kiss Ranti. I think she doesn't like me. But you're smart. But no one wants to be with me. I want to be like you. You're awesome. When am I going to grow like you? Grow how... look, who taught you to smoke? Kids cannot smoke, you just said you wanted to grow! Let's hang out. Where? Let's just go. If they ask, just say you don't know where I am. - Okay? - Yeah. You'll see. One day we will be on that stage. I believe you. Nugi, why are you being so quiet? It's like you don't know him. It's alright. He just met his future step-dad. Right? That again? What's wrong if your mom has a boyfriend? She has the rights to have one. Let's not talk about this. I told you, she needs... Shut up, asshole. Aww, he's upset. You're really... Stop stop stop! That was a mess. We need to change our name. What does that have to do with anything? Maybe if we changed our name, we can play better. We only have one song. But we've changed our name 30 times. So? I have an idea. It's foreign, but sick. Vagina. Cool, huh? It means vagina, the reproductive organ of a woman. You want us to be associated to women's sex organ? Shit, really? No wonder it sounds familiar. Of course because your mind is always dirty. Your face is dirty. But as a symbolic thing it's pretty cool. It has character. Maybe we don't need to change the name, but the members. Fuck you, what do you mean? You have a problem with me? Why would you think about symbols... ...when you could work on improving your skills. You say that like you're so awesome with your playing. Where are you going? Gotta go. French lessons. What kind of rocker takes French lessons? I gotta go too. I need to pick up my girlfriend. This person just tried to give me advice. Think of our band! Not your girlfriend! You both suck. How are we going to improve if this always happens? Gotta go, man. See ya. Go and have fun with your girlfriend. My dad said... Being a musician is not a dream. Fuck this shit. Same. My mom said so, too. I used to want to be a graphic designer. Then why didn't you? I didn't have the money to enroll. I live alone here in Jakarta. My dad killed himself after his company went bankrupt. My mother became an alcoholic and she's been sick for years. She lives with my sibling in Bandung. Seriously? Bitter, huh? But that's life. Does your boyfriend know? My boyfriend has a wife. He said they're getting divorced. But they're still together now. You sure he loves you? No. Then why are you still with him? He promised to pay for my tuition. Do you love him? Maybe. I don't know. Love sometimes make people become irrational. Have you ever... ...fallen in love? Can't be bothered. I want to focus on my band. Girls only make it harder. But I'll be fine having a little fun. Gotta go pee. And you? Ever fallen in love? No. Not once? Haven't found the right person. Love can make you really happy... ...but it can also make you really hurt. So... The relationship you have now... ...is making you happier or hurt more? I'm used to getting hurt. Sometimes pain can be beautiful. When you get used to it. I don't get it. You don't need to understand love. Just feel it. Let's head back. I'm sleepy. If you'd be my girlfriend, I would love to be in a relationship. Stop it. I'm serious. I've liked you since the first time I saw you. Whatever. What else should I say? I'm tired of having this talk. I don't mind you being a little naughty. At least don't be stupid! What are you going to do with your scores like this? Answer me. You already know what I want to be. A musician? Fine. But if you keep flunking like this, I will have to stop your band activities. I want to continue with the band. You need to see your father. Maybe you can become better if it's with him. Yeah, your life would be better too, right? No one would bother you and your boyfriends. Right? What are you saying? Why are you saying that? This has nothing to do with the band. It's about you and your boyfriends. That's why you want to send me to dad's. Look, Jim Morrison! Cool, huh? Who is it? Jim Morrison, The Doors' vocalist! It's on my shirt. Oh, The Doors. "Oh, The Doors"? You say that like it's your friend! You see this? This is what happens when you are being too lenient with him. I'm not lenient, it's just that you can't be strict with him. What do you mean? Every time I scold him... You keep defending him. Now, look. I don't defend him. Say it, "I love Ipang!" - No. - Say it! No because you're ugly! Oh, I see how it is. - Ok, ok, ok. - What? I love Ipang! Where are you going! I love you! I love you! I am a lecturer. How am I not able to educate my own son? What would people say? Why do you care what people say? He is our son. Yes. But he is an embarrassment to me. I think... It's time for us to tell Ipang who he really is. He's big enough now. I'm afraid if we wait, it might be too late. What do you mean? You mean... You want to tell Ipang that he's adopted? How could you? I think it's the best. I don't know what else to do with that kid. Right now? When else? Yeah. When are you planning to tell me that? After all this time, why didn't you tell me? Listen, Ipang. It's not easy for us to tell you the truth. We needed to find the right time to tell you. So that time is now? After you all realize that I'm just a stupid kid... ...useless, and only wants to play music? And not able to set a good example for Dido? Am I right? We didn't mean to... I'm different. I'm not a part of this family, am I? Ipang. To be honest... I don't know what to say. I can't go back home. Don't be so hasty. You need to think carefully. I'm the reckless one in my family. Now I just need time. To be alone. To contemplate. For the holidays... Why don't you come with me to see my father? Isn't he in the US? Turns out he's been here for a year. And... He's ready to meet me now. What do you think? Come on, man. It's just us guys. And we can have fun together. Come on. You sure this is it? Judging from the address, it should be. - Afternoon. - Good afternoon. - Is this Mr. Maryadi's house? - Yes. - You must be Nugi. - Yes. Come in, he's been waiting. Maybe he remarried. I guess. Even if he did, my mom never told me. - But you sure this is his house? - Yes. If you said your dad did taekwondo... ...how come I don't feel the vibe here? That was back when I was 6 years old. Ok thank you. That's our practice for today. Please memorize all the steps. Okay? I can't come the day after tomorrow. My husband just came back from out of town. Gotta recharge him first. Must be fun having a pilot as a husband. You haven't been with him? No wonder you got the moves. Nugi, you should go to the dining room. - Me? - Yes. You wait here for a moment, okay? Okay. Hi. No wonder. Remember who is at home. Can't I have some refreshments once in a while? Hi, good looking! Hello. Remember your place. If Demi Moore can do it, I can do it. You should remember that you have three children at home. Who are you? I'm Ipang. Go home, go home to your husbands and children. Bye Ipang! Gotta go too. Bye Ipang! Bye. Did you have a hard time finding the address? Not at all. Please, have a drink. If it's not sweet enough, would you like some sugar? Thanks, it's okay. I'm cutting off sugar. So I can't drink sweet stuff. I'm here to see my father. You look just like your mom. You know my mother? I'm here to see my father. If I may know, what's your relationship with him? There's a lot that your mother didn't tell you. Because she wanted me to tell you face to face. I'm confused. Who are you? Nugi. The person you are looking for is right in front of you. What do you mean? I'm your father. I mean. I used to be your father. Sorry, I tripped. Please don't joke around. I'm not joking. You are my son. Shut up. I don't want to talk. Let's just sleep then. Let's just put our shirts back on. Come on sleepyheads, wake up! Wake up, wash up, then have breakfast. Hurry, wake up! Ew, why are these filthy shoes in here? So annoying. No more shoes inside the room, okay? You two are disgusting. Wake up or I will spray you. No waking up late in this house. So hurry and wake up, take a shower and have breakfast. Okay, okay. Hey, wake up. Eat up! This is called love fried rice. Because it's made with love. And this is care juice. Because it's made with a lot of care. It's good for you. Come on, Nugi, try the juice. Ipang? Sorry, Uncle. I mean, Auntie. I don't normally drink juice in the morning. I might have digestive problems. Alright, Auntie. I'll have some. Alright, now dig in! Do you want more eggs, Nugi? I'll cook them for you. I can make it cloud-shaped if you want. No, thanks. For you, Ipang? Sure, Auntie. I'll make it for you. I really love cooking. When Nugi was a little boy, I used to cook a lot. Do you still remember? I used to make eggs shaped like an airplane. Remember? Do you like cooking, Ipang? Me? Not at all. But my mom loves to. Young men these days feel ashamed to go to the kitchen. But here, it's different. Once you're done eating, you should do your own dishes. The help only comes once a week here. Because I want to keep my privacy. I'm gonna go and get ready. You two come with me to the supermarket. We're going shopping? Soy sauce, sugar, chili... Check, check, check... What else? Ah, air freshener. You both are disgusting and smelly. I should get as many air fresheners as I can. Let's go. You sure you don't want to get anything else? Q-tips maybe? You have been so silent, I thought you were deaf. Just kidding. If you change your hair and part it to the right... ...you would look cuter. Aw, you're too nice. I bet you would. Nugi, come and dance salsa with me! Come on, honey, you'll make it more fun! Can I borrow your car? I need to get some clothes at home. See ya. I know. It must be hard for you to accept all of this. And I know. You must be disappointed and upset. I won't force you to accept me for who I am. But you also need to know... ...that I became like this not without a reason. What I know... ...is that in a family... ...you have a father... ...and a mother. So I don't care about anything else. We're pretty similar. We're both running away from reality. And it's wrong. But I can't just live with people who aren't like me. They're not different, but I am. I'm a loser and I don't deserve to live there. You're not a loser. You're just saying that. But my dad. Has he ever thought of that? Did he call you a loser? He never said it to my face. But it's the same thing. And he's right. I'm a loser who doesn't know his place. If they aren't my real parents... Then who are my parents? Ipang. Parents don't always mean those who gave birth to you. They have been taking care of you until now. As for me... My own parents didn't take care of me. Life is not perfect. If love hurts... ...and life is not perfect... ...then what is beautiful? Where have you been? Getting clothes? No. I drove around. That took you so long. I love this place. It's just a flea market but there's so many antique stuff you can't find in stores. Your ripped jeans wouldn't sell here, though. Auntie, the more ripped it is, the cooler it looks. Yeah, for cleaning the floor of my house. What's so good about ripped pants? Nugi, which one looks better? Purple or red? They're the same. Ugh, you have bad taste. How about you, Ipang? Purple or red? Purple is the color of widows... ...but red seems brighter? Yeah, I think red suits you better. It's... It's eyecatching. Such a smart one. You have better taste than Nugi. Thief! He took my bag! Help! Stay out of this, lady. Buzz off. Move away. I'm sorry. I'm sorry! Bad boy. That's my mom! My bag! Thank you so much, sister! Can I get some tissue? Once again, thank you, sis! Thank you! Damn, you were so cool, Auntie! I never knew. Look, he's knocked out! Now my nails are ruined. I spent so much time making it look like Krisdayanti's. Can you take me to the salon for a manicure? I can't go around with nails like this. - Yeah. - Of course, we'll take you. Would you help me? What? I have been wanting to join a salsa competition. Salsa? But in this neighborhood, none of the husbands want to learn salsa. For salsa competitions, you need to have a partner. Would you learn with me? Not me. Ipang is good at it. Me? No way. Please? No. No matter how much you pay us. No thank you. Yeah, why would rockers move their hips like that. We're rockers, not dancers. Right? Yeah. Please? My leg often gets a cramp, Auntie. - Please. - I'm busy with the band. Please? Please? Gosh. Why did we choose horror? I can't watch scary things like this. You could knock down a thief but get scared at this? I'm powerful but I'm also sensitive. Look, ugh it's the ghost. Oh God. - Oh no. - Keep quiet, you're embarrassing us. Is it gone yet? Is it gone? It's gone. Don't shout. People are looking. Oh no. Why is it now sad? Is this horror or drama? So sad. So touching. There, there. Stop crying, Auntie. But why did the good looking one die? What a shame. I know, there there. The hero looks like a young Sean Connery. So handsome. Hello? Hello? Hello? Is this you, Ipang? Hello? Who was it? I don't know. When is Ipang coming home? Just be patient, sweetie. Come here. Help me cut off the leaves. Me? Yes, you. Who else is standing there? Cut off the leaves. Careful, don't ruin the crown. This one? Nugi said... ...you have a problem with your parents? Yeah. Any parent would want the best for their children. But they aren't my parents. But they love you, don't they? Fights are normal. But don't make it separate you from your parents. They must be sad having to lose you. Aren't you sad for losing them? I am, but... Okay then. I was just giving a little advice. Do you like flowers? No. You should from now on. So I can have a friend who helps me with this. Just ask Nugi, Auntie, I don't get this. What's your zodiac? - Virgo. - Perfect. Virgos are good with plants. Including making flower bouquets. You're bluffing. Hey, watch your mouth. How's your boyfriend? We broke up. Really? Why? His wife, of course. It's not worth it waiting for him. If I don't have the money to study, oh well. Life itself is a lesson. - And it's free. - True, don't worry about it. You have me as the replacement. Besides, my mom would love to pay for her daughter-in-law's studies. Ipang, you're being quiet. Are you bored? Yeah he's bored. Because he hasn't had a wet dream yet. Do you miss Dido? I wonder what he looks like now? I can't introduce you to Nugi just yet. Yeah, but I can't stay away from you too long, Mariana. I understand. Oh shit. Nugi! You're home. Nugi. This is... Ongky. I should get going. - Nugi. - Save it. I don't wanna hear a thing. Please don't get mad at me. Listen, I have my own life. And... You have your own life. So from now on, let's just live our lives. Nugi! Where are we going? Away from this shitty life. Ipang, join us! Ipang. Come on. Why are you just sitting down? - Have fun! - Hey. Come here and stop meditating, idiot. Let's have fun. Don't sulk. You look fucking ugly man. Fuck you, like you're so handsome. Wait a sec. What's wrong with you? Don't know. Just forget about everything. Let's just have some fun. Here, let's take shots. For our dreams to become famous rockstars. - And for losers like me. - Life sucks! Rock and roll! I'm so sad that it turned out like this. It's okay. It's not easy for Nugi to process all of this. He needs time. I know. I even prepared myself. If Nugi never accepts me as one of his parents... Don't overthink it. You don't know what it's like to be me. People misunderstand me. They bully me, and laugh at me. But what hurts me the most... ...is if my own son would not accept me. There, there. It's okay. Look. She looks so innocent when she's sleeping. Who would have guessed her life is so messy? It seems that I'm really falling for her. Ugh, my head is spinning. I'm gonna go get something to eat. You're awake? Do you still have a headache? A little. What? Is something wrong? Fuck, I left my wallet. So this is what it is? Listen, don't just point fingers. Where are you going? You can't just leave. Listen to me! What? What are you gonna say? - Traitor. - Watch your mouth. - Fuck you. - Fuck you! If you like her, then say so! - Loser! - Look who is leaving! You're the loser! How are you? You said you wanted to talk. Just cut to the chase. We all want you to come home. Your poor mother... She keeps crying about you. And Dido keeps asking for you. For what? I'm nobody. You... You are our son. You're Dido's brother. And nothing can ever change that. Yeah but for what? I'm just an embarrassment to the family. It'd be better if I'm not around. I have been tough on you. But that's because I care. One day you will have big responsibilities. With your own family. That is what I want to teach you. However... My method was... ...wrong. I'm sorry. I'm sorry too. For causing too much problems for the family. Ipang. I ask you to think about it carefully. Then make a decision. And whatever you decide on, you should know... That you... ...will always be our son. And all of us... We love you. Oh right. Dido asked me to give this to you. Yes. I'm fine. Nugi is home. You take care. Thank God. I feel better now. Please take care of him, darling. You know... I really love your father. And whatever the condition we are in now... ...it doesn't change how much I love him. You know why? Because it's written in the stars. And I'm okay with it. As long as it makes him happy. I shouldn't have been born. A child can never repay his parents. What he can do, though, is to make them happy. Your father has had too many people leave his life. I thought... ...you and dad could get back together. You look ugly. - Why are you here? - What's wrong? You got a problem? Go away, I'm still sleepy. You stink. Fuck you. Where's Sandra? Why are you asking? I want to apologize. I was wrong. It wasn't right for me to say that. When you left... ...she left too. I'm sorry, man. Forget about it. You should leave this place. You have no money left, right? But I need your help. - Doing what? - Well... I'll tell you later. Okay? - What's that? - What? I don't know, look over here. What... You stink! You've missed me, haven't you? You made me smell your fart! Relax! That hurt! Let's give a round of applause! Next is contestant number eight! Congratulations. Both of you were spectacular. Thanks, Auntie. - I gotta go get my stuff. - Okay. Thank you, Nugi. I'm so touched. You're welcome. Mom. What did you just call me? Don't make me say it again. Say it again. It makes me happy. Mom. Great, you're crying. Please don't cry. These are happy tears. Okay, take a deep breath. Breathe in. Hold it. And breathe out. But I want to hear it one more time. Okay fine. Dido! Where have you been? We all love you. Mom keeps crying. Everytime she remembers you. Will you come home? I miss you. Okay. I'll come home. By the way, I made a move on Ranti. I kissed her! That's my boy! In the name of God, we have reached the end of the show. I will announce the third place right now. The bronze medal goes to contestant number four! What a hot couple! And for second place, the winner is... Mrs. Sianipar, your child is waiting at the security. Because the child has lost the mother, how can this happen? Moral decadence. The second place goes to contestants number eight! The perfect combination of old and young! Hey, asshole! Hey, you! This jerk! - What is this? - What's your problem? Your face sucks! Fuck you! Fuck you all! Fuck you! Catch me if you can! Hey stop there! Catch us, idiot! You dumb fool, always making problems. You just had to pull your pants down. It's called spotlight, we're new, so gotta give them something to talk about. - Nonsense. - Whatever. Hey, how did you fall for him? Because he's nuts. Nuts, and I'm huge, right? - I'm bigger. - You believe him? Pull down your pants! You rock, baby. But why is your underwear striped? It was a present from Dido!
