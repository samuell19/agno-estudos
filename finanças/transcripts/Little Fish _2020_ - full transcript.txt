Nothing. EMMA VOICEOVER: I was so sad the day I met you. (LIGHT DRAMATIC MUSIC) (ENGINE RUMBLING) (SIRENS WAILING) I can't remember why. (SIRENS WAILING) Just stop listening. Stop thinking. Tune it out. What's that thing you're supposed to do? Count sheep? One sheep, two sheep, (LIGHT DRAMATIC MUSIC) black sheep, blue sheep. (DOG WHINES) Blue. I wonder if Blue ever worries. Nah. Blue doesn't worry. All these little pieces. (FIREWORKS SIZZLING) So much to remember. (MUFFLED TALKING) That smoke smell in Jude's hair. Samantha telling stories of the road and Ben agonizing over the playlist. What was the song? I can't remember anymore. Focus on the important things. Jude Andrew Williams.

No, no, no, just that cowards like me only text. JUDE: Oh, well, well, I did text, but then I realized I wasn't gonna get to hear that cool accent again. So, uh... (LAUGHS) Um, um. I'm at a Halloween party so sorry if it's a little bit loud. JUDE: Yeah, me too. How is yours? Yeah, it's fine. Just a typical Halloween party. JUDE: Cool, well, uh you better get back to it then. Actually it's a bag of wank. JUDE: It's what? It's just shit, it's really shit. JUDE: I bet you my Halloween party is 10 times worse. Prove it. (UPBEAT MUSIC) Can't it wait till tomorrow? A dog might've been hit by a car, the details are unclear. Do you want me to come with you? No, no, no, no, you stay here. Have fun and I'll speak to you tomorrow. (ENGINE RUMBLING) Hey! Are you George Washington? (LAUGHS) No. No, I'm Claude Bourgelat. Who's Clark Bergo... - Who's Claude- - Come on up, I'll buzz you. Which way am I going? Just that way. (LIGHT MUSIC) (DOOR BUZZING) Claude Bourgelat, the French veterinary surgeon who actually opened up the very first veterinary practices in Lyon. Lyon. Is your costume a guy who Googles things and pretends he already knew 'em? (LAUGHS) That is my costume. Yeah, funny, you're actually the only person to get it right. - Shall I.. Can I? - Yeah, come meet these clowns, come on. (LIGHT MUSIC) Welcome. Come, come. Everybody, this is Emma. Emma, this is everybody. EMMA VOICEOVER: Jude Andrew Williams. He always had a camera in his hand and a photograph in his mind. Yeah, come on, man! EMMA VOICEOVER: He could seem guarded at first but if you ever needed to know how he really felt you could just look at his pictures. (LIGHT MUSIC) (CAMERA CLICKS) (MUFFLED TALKING) It was hard to believe that was only the beginning. (LIGHT MUSIC) (MUFFLED TALKING) (CAMERA CLICKS) Can I kiss you? I'm not available. Right. Tom. Tim. Tim. That's even worse. (EMMA LAUGHS) So, do you love him? - No. - No? Then why are you with him? It's just what's happening right now. Yeah, but that's not even true 'cause you're here right now. I, uh, I can respect that you're doing your thing, just take note that I asked I guess. Noted. After you. (LIGHT MUSIC) That didn't happen! (DOOR SQUEAKS) EMMA VOICEOVER: It feels wrong to make this about us. It's bigger than that. (LIGHT MUSIC) So much bigger. We'd hear stories from somewhere like the coast of Maryland or Florida. Always there, not here. Like the story of the man stranded in the ocean picked up by a fishing boat. It turned out he was another fisherman, his boat washed up to shore four days later. He said he couldn't remember how to steer it so he decided to swim home. Or the woman in the marathon who forgot to stop running. (ENGINE RUMBLING) (SIREN WAILING) There's something quite beautiful to these stories at first. But then a pilot forgot how to fly. They call it NIA. Neuroinflammatory Affliction. It can affect anyone, and there's no cure. Ben was the first person we knew to get sick. We say get sick, but that's not really it. Some people snap all at once, other people fade away. I'm not really sure which one is worse. (BLANKETS RUSTLING) Sup? Nothing apparently. Fell asleep. (LIGHT MUSIC) (LIGHT CLICKS) (BIRDS CHIRPING) Jude? - Yeah? - Hey, I'm going now. All right.

Awesome, that's awesome. - You should come. - Tonight? Yeah. Well, I gotta check with my wife. - Wife? - Yeah, I got married. Get the fuck outta here. Holy shit, man. - Man, we gotta catch up. - Yeah. You got a minute? Yeah, I got a minute. - You need a hand or what? - Yeah, of course, come on. - All right. - Are you still rolling with the same crew? JUDE: Yeah, I still see 'em. Yeah, yeah, yeah, what happened?

We wanted pictures of the girls getting ready. We paid for pictures of the girls getting ready. Yeah, I understand, I- - No, no, I don't think you do understand. Those moments are gone, we don't get those back. We had to get my nephew here to take pictures. Yeah, sorry, sir. I'll get a full deposit back to you. Hey, hey. Just take some fucking pictures. - Okay. - Yes, sir. (MUFFLED TALKING) (PHONE RINGING) MOM: Hi, love. Hi, Mom. MOM: How is it, then? Yeah, fine. How was Germany? MOM: Oh, didn't I tell you? That trip got postponed. I'm still at home, but I'll be going there in a few weeks. Mom, you have to tell me these things, I'm coming to see you in a month. - Hun- - Will you be back by then? MOM: I thought I did tell ya. Didn't I? But don't worry, I'll be back. How are ya? I'm okay. Work's getting stressful, but I'm looking forward to coming and seeing ya. I wish they hadn't grounded all those flights so I could come sooner, but it's all right. MOM: Oh, remind me. Is David coming with ya? - Jude? - What? EMMA: Jude. MOM: Oh, God, what did I say? Chris, Henry, David, Jude. You know I was never good with names anyhow. (LIGHT DRAMATIC MUSIC) Yeah. Yeah, no, but it's not the first time you've forgotten, Mom. I know I told ya I could only get the one ticket. MOM: Of course, that's right. Well, hug Jude for me, will ya? Yeah. Mom. MOM: What? Are you feeling okay? MOM: Yes, love. I'm great. You let me do the worrying over here. (LIGHT DRAMATIC MUSIC) (ENGINE RUMBLING) You all right? Yeah, you? I'm not even a vet anymore, I'm just an executioner. I hate it. I had to put down the most beautiful pup today, she had the most expressive eyes. They were like human eyes. I was gonna call you and see if I could take her home. Let's... Please let's not get into that again. It's just one dog. No, but it's not just one. If we take one we'll probably take 17 and we already got Blue, we don't have room. You know that we can't. (ENGINE RUMBLING) (MUFFLED TALKING) What's happening? (LIGHT DRAMATIC MUSIC) MAN: Why are you stopping? (TALKING OVER EACH OTHER) Yeah, I don't think this bus is going anywhere. WOMAN: What is happening right now? MAN: Attention. If you are lost or need assistance, call 707 and have your ID ready. If someone you know is lost or missing, check the missing person database or call 811 (EMMA HUMMING) (JUDE HUMMING) (KNIFE TAPPING) Do you think anybody's immune? Oh yeah. Me, for instance. All right, so it doesn't affect the geniuses amongst us. (GASPS) What if the only person who's immune already has Alzheimers? Ooh. So you'd never know. Ooh, yeah. That is so fucked up that's probably how it is. Or what if this is just the next phase of human evolution and we should just embrace it? We fucked everything up so badly that the only way to survive this is just by forgetting. Mm hmm, yeah, I like that, too. (DOG BARKS) What about dogs? Do you think dogs are susceptible? Unclear. They rely more on associative memories, so just don't change the way you smell and keep feeding him and you'll be fine. Hey, don't you fucking forget about me, Blue! Oh, I'm sorry, bud. I didn't think you'd take that so seriously. Yeah, I love you, too. Yeah, sorry, buddy. (JUDE SIGHS) It's a shame we can't take some of them. The dogs. (LIGHT MUSIC) They've been putting down so many recently. What? Yeah, just like a puppy or something. I'm sure Blue wouldn't mind. What? You said we couldn't. When? We had an argument about this last week and then we were just about to get into it again on the bus. Very good. - Jude, I'm- - Almost. This is an ongoing argument that we've been having, we were just about to get into it half an hour ago. It was just now. I don't remember that. Oh my God. (LIGHT DRAMATIC MUSIC) Did you know this was happening? No, how am I gonna know I forgot? Do you know who I am? Yeah, you're my wife, Emma Veta. Where did we meet? What's your father's name? - Where did you grow up? - Emma! (LIGHT DRAMATIC MUSIC) This is gonna be like Ben, isn't it? EMMA VOICEOVER: When your disaster is everyone's disaster, how do you grieve? When Ben first started losing his memory he wanted us to record every song he'd ever written before they were all gone. (LIGHT MUSIC) (WOMAN HUMS) Wanna do it again? One, two, three, four. (LIGHT MUSIC) You got this. Just relax, you got this. It's not happening. It's not happening, it's just not happening. You got it. If you want, we can just record the guitar first and the vocals and then I can open up the bass. JUDE: Yeah, sounds good. SAM: Okay.

What about you? What about me? What are you doing? Oh, well, I've been around a lot with Ben and Sam touring, - taking pictures. - Yeah. For different bands, different magazines. EMMA: Oh, cool. Yeah. I helped them record. It was a cool way to spend the first half of my 20s, but things got a little outta hand with drinking, drugs. Uh, Sam's parents were out here so we came here to dry out and kinda never really left. Is that why you don't drink anymore? Yeah. What was it that happened to make you stop? That's a pretty intense second date question. Sorry. I'm just being nosy. Just tell me to shut up. So, actually, do you want me to leave? I'll go. No, it's all right, I'll go. You stay here.

DORMER: So, how long would you say you've been experiencing symptoms of NIA? JUDE: Like a month. I can remember some things, but other things are just gone. Like details, I can't do details. Like I can remember people, who they are, but I can't zero in. Your brain may be trying to bridge the gaps, taking other moments you still remember and merging with false memories. (TAPPING) (JUDE GASPS) JUDE: So, the treatment. Is it like what? It's like a pill or? DORMER: We'll be doing an oral CP. JUDE: Sorry, what? An oral cranial puncture. Think of it as clearing a clogged pathway. The brain is separated into four major lobes. The one most closely associated with memory being temporal. Now, we remove the lateral through he roof of the mouth. (HIGH PITCHED RINGING) (DISTORTED TALKING) Inter-cranial hypertensions. (HIGH PITCHED RINGING) (DISTORTED TALKING) (DRAMATIC MUSIC) - Jude? - Yeah? Are you okay? Yeah. But what are the risks? We have some literature we can send home with you that really walks you through the ins and outs of the procedure. It's not complicated, but there are significant risks. We have a counselor on hand to help make sure you understand what we're dealing with. (LIGHT DRAMATIC MUSIC) (BIRDS CHIRPING) EMMA VOICEOVER: To identify a neuroinflammation begin by asking baseline questions. What's your name? How old are ya? What's your favorite color? This is all they've given ya? Brain teasers? I thought there was supposed to be some sort of procedure. Yeah, it's brain teasers and... And? Surgery. They take like a metal straw and... (JUDE SIGHS) I don't wanna do it, Em. What'd the doctor say? They don't even know if it's gonna work, it's like a trial. Let's see and find out, let's poke around in some dude's skull and hope we don't cripple him and make him go blind. I'm not doing it, man. I could just wind up with no memory, no legs, and no eyes. And if I'm gonna forget who I am then I'd at least like to be able to see where I'm going. EMMA: So you made up your mind then. Yeah. Do I not get a say in this? Emma, you can't ask me - to sit there while- - But Jude, I am asking ya, I am asking ya, I have to ask ya. I get it, you don't wanna go blind or end up in a wheelchair but if there's a chance that we can stop it then I don't understand why you won't try. - I know you're upset- - I'm not fucking upset, Jude! Well, you don't sound very not fucking upset! My mom's starting to fade. Why didn't you tell me? Because I can't do anything about it, Jude. I've got a ticket that I can't change for weeks from now and now I've got this, I've got you. So what am I supposed to do? Just go off to England while my husband forgets about me? I'm not fucking doing that. I'm not losing my mom and my husband in the same breath, so I need you to explain it to me. Can you explain it to me why you won't do this? What? Because you don't care? No, of course I fucking care, Emma. This is happening to me. This is fucking scary for me, too. I'm scared. I'm fucking scared. (EMMA SNIFFLES) Who am I? How old am I? What's my favorite color?

I wanna fucking marry you. - Yeah? - Yeah. (LIGHT DRAMATIC MUSIC) Shit. Change your mind already? No, I don't have a ring. Then buy me a fish. Yeah?

I don't fucking know her! No, no, no, this is your house. This is your house. - It is, right? - Yeah, that's Samantha. - Sam. - I don't know Sam. Man, you've been together for a while.

Moments ago DPC issued a statement indicating that the early results of their controversial NIA treatments are quote overwhelmingly positive. Now, in that same statement they also say that due to overwhelming demand that they are not able to accept any new applicants. What do you make of that? I guess if this treatment is having some success, that's wonderful news. WOMAN: Overwhelmingly positive certainly sounds like they - might be onto something. - What can I get you? REPORTER: It does, but they have already closed off a very selective monitor to the general public and I assume that the FDA has been- - Tea. REPORTER: There are people with loved ones who are afflicted with this who want a chance. WOMAN: Stop, don't touch me! MAN: Stop here! WOMAN: Stop it! Get away from me! MAN: Stop! Stop it! WOMAN: Stop! Turn the boat around! WOMAN: Stop the boat! We have to go back, we have to go back. Stop! I don't know who you are! - Help me! - Stop her! (DRAMATIC MUSIC) - Stop her! - Help me! - Okay. - Help me! - What's happening? - Help! Turn the boat around! No, stop touching me, please. Just get away from me. We have to go back, please! Don't! Stop it! Back off, back up. Get away! Em? WOMAN: Go back, we need to go back! - Em? - Jude! JUDE: Em! (DRAMATIC MUSIC) (WATER SPLASHING) MAN: Hurry! Throw it in! MAN: Turn the boat around! (LIGHT DRAMATIC MUSIC) (MUFFLED YELLING) EMMA VOICEOVER: Overwhelmingly positive results. The first sign of a cure and they shut everyone out. (EVERYONE YELLING) (SMASHING) It's no wonder people are going crazy. And while they went crazy all we could do was wait. Wait to hear that we got an in. Wait to hear that we were gonna be okay. (SIRENS WAILING) We're gonna be okay. This procedure works. A viral video is causing a stir today of a Dr. Sam Tomlin of the DPC walking viewers through a step-by-step tutorial of the procedure which supposedly puts a halt to NIA symptoms. (SIRENS WAILING) Already we're getting reports from local emergency rooms of more than a dozen new patients who've attempted the procedure on themselves. EMMA VOICEOVER: We're gonna be okay. We have increased police presence and cannot stress enough this is not a proven cure. Step back now! REPORTER: It is, at best, a promising lead in the road to a cure. (GLASS SHATTERING) We urge everyone to remain calm. (SMASHING) EMMA VOICEOVER: We're gonna be okay. (PHONE BUZZING) Hello? Yes, speaking. Sorry, I thought he was already in. Yeah, that's... that's not possible. Um, can I speak to Dr. Dormer please? Well, can I talk to someone? Who's your supervisor? Yeah, but there's been a mistake and you need to check again. Or I need to someone who can sort it out. Fine. Yeah, fine. (LIGHT DRAMATIC MUSIC) Fuck. Jude. They said they didn't take you 'cause you've got drugs in your system. What? EMMA: You know what they're talking about? Nope. Jude, you can't lie to me about this stuff. Emma, I swear to God, I've been sober for five years. You know that, I wouldn't just fuck things up like that. So what? They're just lying? Unless it's a mistake. What did they say? They said they found cocaine in your system and now you can't get the procedure done. Is that true? No, it can't be true. (LIGHT MUSIC) EMMA: Jude. Fuck. What? I ran into an old friend from way back and I used to party a lot with him. I thought we just caught up. I don't remember, but that's the only time I could've... So it's possible, then. (JUDE SIGHS) (EMMA CLEARS THROAT) I just need a minute. (SIGHS) Damn. (BIRDS CHIRPING) SAM: I can't do this. What do you mean? He's been forgetting pieces of himself for the last six months. Tonight he just forgot me. Oh, darling. This is going to get worse. I love him, Emma. I love him so much. But it's a sinking ship. I can either tie myself to him and get dragged down or cut loose and try to stay alive. I understand, but- - I don't think you understand, Emma. I truly hope you never have to understand. The man who promised he was gonna love me forever, he just tried to stab me with a kitchen knife that my mother gave him. What the fuck am I supposed to do right now? EMMA VOICEOVER: They lost each other. (BIRDS CHIRPING) But I won't lose you. Tell me about our first kiss. Jude. The walls, there were these black shapes. (LIGHT DRAMATIC MUSIC) Well, I don't remember the walls. Can I kiss you? Our first kiss can't be in line for the loo. I didn't say that. JUDE: No? No, I said I'm not available. Right, Tim. EMMA: Tom. But I thought his name was Tim. Yeah, but you always called him Tom. - Tom. - Tim. Tim. That's even worse. So, do you love him? - No. - No? You didn't even have to think about it. No, I didn't. Tell me about the walls. I don't remember the walls. (LIGHT MUSIC) What's this? JUDE: It's a picture of you. What's this? Do you know who I am? JUDE: You're Emma. Then why'd you have to write this down? I'm doing my best. When were we married, Jude? April. No, uh, August. August? When did we get married, Jude? Uh, it was a Wednesday in August. Just... Just focus on the details, the memory has dozens of threads to the other memories. Was it in a church? I don't know. Was it a big wedding? Steps. Steps. Yeah, we kissed on some steps. It was a Thursday, it was just us, we decided we didn't wanna wait until the date. EMMA: What color was the dress? JUDE: White. Blue. Do you remember who was there? (MUFFLED TALKING) (SOMBER MUSIC) Uh... Ben. Samantha. Congratulations. I love you, I'm so happy. He played us a song. - I wrote this for you. - No, no, no. He gave us a song. Our song. (LIGHT MUSIC) ♪ Stay awake just to burn you into my mind ♪ ♪ Don't fall asleep till I see you and I close my eyes ♪ ♪ Pull you closer just to feel you breathing ♪ ♪ Blend your flesh to mine ♪ Close your eyes. Why? Just close 'em. ♪ Darkness when I close my eyes ♪ (LIGHT MUSIC) Do you remember meeting me? (WATER SPLASHING) A waterpark. I remember a waterpark and it was October, it was cold. Hi. It was the day they shutdown the park. Everything was going outta business, every day was something's last day. We were the oldest people there. We were the only people there. ♪ I'll take you dancing in the flickering lights ♪ ♪ I'll spin your hand ♪ I was so sad the day I met you. JUDE: Why? Can't remember. I just know that after I saw you I wasn't sad anymore. ♪ Just to see you dancing ♪ (WATER SPLASHING) (EMMA GRUNTS) We were married October 14th of last year. We didn't have a wedding, we just went right to the courthouse. Ben and Sam were there. Your dad was there. Your friends, my friends. It was a mad dash with no warning and still so many people made it. I'm so sorry I don't remember. It's not your fault, though. (LIGHT MUSIC) I haven't forgotten how I feel. EMMA VOICEOVER: So much to remember. All these little pieces. For some people NIA is a slow drip, for others it's a stop all at once. For you it's slow. This can work. (RAIN PATTERING) Okay, left! No, my left! Keep going! Perfect! Pretty fucking cool, huh? EMMA: Yeah, it's cool! Hang on. (CAMERA CLICKS) EMMA VOICEOVER: Every day he rediscovers the city. JUDE: Oh, fuck, fuck, fuck! EMMA VOICEOVER: Places we had known in special ways were strange again. Move back. All right. I think it took. EMMA VOICEOVER: Some things were easy. Hang on. EMMA VOICEOVER: And some things are hard. Have we been here before? No. No, we haven't. EMMA VOICEOVER: Because his losses were mine, too. (WATER TRICKLING) What the? What is this, a fish? Yeah. I got it with you. Do you like it? (EMMA LAUGHS) What, what, what? What? Oh, my God. No! (EMMA LAUGHS) - We got matching tats. - We did indeed. EMMA VOICEOVER: Do I know you better than you know yourself? Right now, maybe. Why did we tattoo fish? (LIGHT DRAMATIC MUSIC) (KNOCKING) - Oh, thank god! - What? (JUDE SIGHS) Oh shit, I couldn't, uh... I knew that we lived on Ormand but I couldn't remember which door so I just knocked on 'em all and nobody wanted to help me. Darling. Here you go. It's okay. EMMA VOICEOVER: I find myself wondering how to build a future if you keep having to rebuild the past. Yeah, it woulda been nice to know that I fucking had this and I don't know. (DOGS BARKING) EMMA VOICEOVER: Life goes forwards, not backwards. I'm still reading about the brain, taking notes. I don't know, feeling like I'm doing something. (PAPER RUSTLING) (PHONE BUZZING) Mom? MAN: Uh, is this Emma Ryerson? Oh my God, is she okay? MAN: She's all right. We identified her. She's in the hospital now and people are looking after her. Does she know who she is? MAN: She knows her first name. Bits and pieces. Um... Could you tell her that Emma, that her daughter loves her and I haven't forgotten and that I'm gonna try and be there as soon as I can. Would you tell her that please? (GULLS CAWING) EMMA VOICEOVER: What were we even trying to save? Our experiences together? Is that all I love about him? I wish I could look at him and just find what went missing. But he looks the same. Jude, I'm so tired of this. (LIGHT DRAMATIC MUSIC) JUDE: I have to ask you something. Okay. I'm not sure how. Is it scary? Yeah. I've been doing some reading about the procedure and what they were gonna do to me. Okay. And I was thinking we could do it. Do it? Yeah, or you could do it. At work. Are you being serious? Yeah, I know it sounds crazy, but they have these videos online and they swear that it worked. No, they swear that it worked. You take this long needle and you find this nerve at the base of the brain- - You didn't wanna do it when professionals were gonna do it, Jude, I'm a vet. Yeah, I know, but I'm going, Em. We have to try and I'm gonna feel better knowing that it's you. No, you can't ask me to do that. No, but I am asking you. But what if, um... What if something goes wrong or I hurt you or I make it worse or you get an infection? Well, I wouldn't of asked you if I hadn't thought about all of that. I trust you. I don't know what else to do. I don't know what else there is. (LIGHT DRAMATIC MUSIC) (ENGINE RUMBLING) (DOG BARKING) (KEYS JINGLING) (DOGS BARKING) (DOOR THUDS) Stay here, I'm gonna go and check. (LIGHT DRAMATIC MUSIC) (DOG BARKING) (DOOR CLICKS) Okay, we're all safe. (LIGHT DRAMATIC MUSIC) MAN: This ridge should soften into a membrane that will give a little when you push it. This area will be the puncture point. Okay. Okay, this is what we use to open dog's mouths when we clean the teeth. It won't really fit, but it will stop you from biting. Wider. How's that? How do I look? (MUFFLED TALKING) (LIGHT DRAMATIC MUSIC) (DOGS BARKING) (EMMA SIGHS) Um... Carfentanil could kill you so I'm gonna give you some Telazol for the pain- (JUDE GROANS) - Jude- - No drugs, I gotta be... - I wanna be- - Jude. No, please, fuck that shit. Come on. (JUDE SIGHS) (DOGS BARKING) (SUSPENSEFUL MUSIC) - (JUDE SIGHS) - You ready? (JUDE HUMS) - I'm ready. - You ready? Yeah, yeah. Take a deep breath. Deep breath. (SUSPENSEFUL MUSIC) Breathe. Deep breath. Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. You all right? You all right? Yeah, we got this. Come on, come on. Yo! Yo! (JUDE GROANS) All right, let's get it. Come on. EMMA: Are you sure? Yeah, yeah, yeah. Let's go, let's go, let's go. (LIGHT DRAMATIC MUSIC) Here we go, come on. Okay, deep breath. (JUDE GROANS) Deep breath, deep breath, deep breath. Deep breath. (JUDE GROANS) Jude, I don't know. (JOAN GROANS) (SHOE SQUEAKING) Jude, I don't know, I don't know. (JUDE SCREAMS) (DRAMATIC MUSIC) (BIRDS CHIRPING) (LIGHT MUSIC) Close your eyes. - Why? - Just close 'em. All right, pretend we're somewhere hot. - Okay. - Like the jungle. EMMA: No, Hawaii. Hawaii? (EMMA HUMS) All right, so we're in Hawaii. Let's pretend we just got married. EMMA: We did just get married. Oh yeah. So, all right, it's our honeymoon, we're in Hawaii, and we're in the water but you gotta sneak off because there is jellyfish and sharks. And the water is dead clear so I'll be able to spot 'em a mile away. No, but it's like three a.m. so it's dark. And if you look out onto the horizon you can see like la lightnening storm=. Am I naked? Hell yeah, it's a honeymoon. Always. Me, too. Sounds perfect. Yeah. Perfect Hawaiian honeymoon. Don't ever forget it. (THUNDER RUMBLING) Easy. Easy. What happened? You blacked out. - I blacked out? - Yeah. Jude, slowly, slowly. Oh. Did we get it? I'm not sure. How long was I out for? 10 minutes. (SIGHS) Oh, for God sake, Jude. It was so scary. (LIGHT DRAMATIC MUSIC) EMMA VOICEOVER: Did I hurt ya? Did I help ya? How long until we'll know? (LIGHT DRAMATIC MUSIC) (ZIPPER BUZZING) (BAG RUSTLING) You going somewhere? Who are you? What? Oh, fuck off. Fuck off, Jude. For fuck's sake! That's so annoying! How could you tell? I could see you chew your lip you were trying to do your stupid smile you stupid twat. - Sorry. - Oh, thank you. Good morning. (JUDE SIGHS) Hey, can we take the car, just go do like a road trip or something? Put this guy in the back seat. Do you feel up for that? Yeah. Yeah, I could use the air. (LIGHT MUSIC) (ENGINE RUMBLING) Out of all the concerts that you've been to, what was the worst? Uh... Oh, I saw Courtney Love in Vegas. She came out, sang one line, and got hit with a chocolate bar and left. (LAUGHS) No. She said, "Fuck you, Las Vegas!" (BOTH LAUGHING) And then she left. What about you? Uh, you at karaoke last year. Absolutely traumatic experience for me and everyone around. Traumatic? Oh, completely tone deaf. It's good you have hands, though. (JUDE LAUGHS) Everything shuts down when you start singing. ♪ Do do do do ♪ ♪ Do do do do ♪ ♪ Do be do be be ♪ It's the face that you do as well. I can't even look at ya. (JUDE LAUGHS) (LIGHT MUSIC) I folded my ears in on themselves 'cause I can't do it. (LIGHT MUSIC) (CAMERA CLICKS) - Oh, is that fun? - Blue! Is that fun? (DOG BARKS) Blue, Blue! - Catalog, Blue. - Blue! Yeah, boy. EMMA: Have you got the key? Huh? Have you got the key? Yeah, he said the mailbox. (METAL SCREECHING) No? Hang on. (BIRDS CHIRPING) (KEYS JINGLING) - He must have forgot. - Okay. (FIRE CRACKLING) I still have no news on my mom. Still? Did you try your aunt? Yeah, I've tried her as well. Yeah, I got something I need to say to you but it doesn't feel like the right time. But I don't feel like I can wait. Okay. Uh... I wrote it down so I wouldn't mess it up. (JUDE SIGHS) There's no easy way to say this, but it didn't work. (LIGHT MUSIC) I woke up this morning and I didn't recognize you. So it definitely didn't work. Emma, now I'm starting to forget even you. (PAPER RUSTLING) Dear Emma, I wanted to write this to you, I wanted to say this to you while I still have as much of me as I do. Every morning I wake up and I have to look at Polaroids with names on 'em just so I can remember that he's Blue. Or like this morning when we left I had to let you go out first because I couldn't remember which car was ours. There's chaos all around us, people freaking out looking for cures, we're losing our friends, you're losing your mom, borders are sealed, flights are grounded, and people are getting lost on their own streets. And in the middle of it it feels like it's just us doing whatever the fuck we can. So I wanted to come out here while it's still quiet so that I could look you in the eye in case before I'm all gone and tell you that you are the love of my life because you make me laugh every day and you make my life worth living and you make me feel like I'm not alone. And if things were normal, then you'd be the person that'd make it okay that I gotta grow old and die someday because at least I got to spend some of that time with you. But things aren't normal and so I guess instead, or as well, I love you because you stayed. Because when things got scary you knuckled down and you stayed. And you got me through each day. And I hope I did the same for you, or I hope that I can still do the same for you somehow. Yeah, yeah, I just had to because I feel we gotta be real. Yeah. (LIGHT DRAMATIC MUSIC) (LIPS SMACKING) (LIGHT MUSIC) (BIRDS CHIRPING) (MUFFLED TALKING) (DOG BARKING) JUDE: What's this? Come on. Come on. (JUDE WHISTLING) Oh, come here. Yeah, yeah. You can't get that stick. You can't get there first. You can't get that stick. You can't get that stick. - Hey! - Hey. This dog's cool. His name's Blue. Oh, Blue! Yeah. Yeah. (BLUE BARKS) Yeah, Blue. Come on. (LIGHT MUSIC) What? Come on. (ENGINE RUMBLING) (LIGHT MUSIC) EMMA: Oh no, are they turning us around? JUDE: Uh, I don't know. (SIREN WAILS) (WINDOW HUMMING) OFFICER: IDs please. Is this road closed, sir, or what? OFFICER: Just the IDs. Why? OFFICER: Government mandated for the missing persons database. We're not missing. Not yet. Okay, go on through. (LIGHT DRAMATIC MUSIC) (ENGINE RUMBLING) How many today? Oh, just one. Maybe people are remembering to close their gates. Yeah, well, I've got that. Cheers. Here you are. Here you go. Thank you. - Here. - Thank you much. That'll take care of it. Let me give you this. (LIGHT MUSIC) Thanks. Hey, um, just wondering if you know where Frank is. He's the guy that usually comes here. He's called Frank. ANNIE: Frank hasn't been here in weeks. I'm Annie. Do you not remember me? No, of course I knew, I was just wondering if you've heard from Frank. No, I haven't. (DOOR SLAMS) Sorry. (LIGHT DRAMATIC MUSIC) (PAPER RUSTLING) (HIGH PITCHED RINGING) (LIGHT MUSIC) Where you off to? On the hike. Why do you wanna go on a hike? It's winter, it'll be cold. I asked you last night, you said we could go on a hike. Yeah, you're right, I did say that I just didn't think you'd remember. Are you coming or? Yeah. (CAMERA CLICKS) (LIGHT MUSIC) (BIRDS CHIRPING) Come on. (ROCKS RUSTLING) Beautiful, huh? Come on, let's get it. What? - Let's go, like- - Oh, Jude. Just go like here. Right there. EMMA: For fuck's sake. What do you want me to do? You know, just do your thing. Oh, Jude, this is... This is gonna look shit. Turn around. - Nightmare. - Look, whale. Oh, Jude, I'm not in the mood for this. - That's good. - No. - Yeah, walk towards me. - Enough, enough. Yeah, that's good, that's good, that's good. Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. Yes. (WAVES CRASHING) (BIRDS CHIRPING) Oh shit, can I get one more? Just here? Yeah, yeah, yeah. (EMMA GROANS) Yes! (CAMERA CLICKS) It's a nice camera. I hope it turns out. (LIGHT DRAMATIC MUSIC) Jude? Jude. Hey. - Jude. - What? - Everything okay? - No, no, no. - What? - No, no, Jude. You all right? - No. - Is there a problem? - Jude, who am I? - Huh? - Who am I? - I don't Know. Do not touch me, please. No, Jude, look at me, look at me. What, what, can I help? - I'm your wife. - Can I help? - What? - I'm your wife, Emma. - All right, I can't do this. - Jude, Jude. - Jude, I'm your wife. - Out of my personal space - here, can you- - Jude, I'm your wife. Jude, look at me. Who am I? No, don't touch me, man. Look, we left the house this morning- - Are you fucking crazy? We left the house this morning. All right, all right, I don't- - Who am I and what's my favorite color? - Are you deranged? - Who am I, what's my fav- - Are you deranged? - Jude, Jude, just relax. - Will you not touch me? - Just relax. - Fuck, man. - Jude. - Please, we leave together. - Will you not touch me? - I just told you once. - Jude, I'm going crazy. Please, just look me. Jude, look at- (THUDDING) (HEAVY BREATHING) Listen, I don't know if you're a psychopath or you're sick or what's going on but it's got nothing to do with me, all right? I'm sorry I pushed you. I'll see if I can get you some help. (WAVES SLOSHING) Jude! (LIGHT DRAMATIC MUSIC) Jude. (HEAVY BREATHING) (EMMA CRIES) (LIGHTS CLICKING) (DRAMATIC MUSIC) (DRAMATIC MUSIC) EMMA VOICEOVER: I was so sad the day I met ya. Oh, hello. (LAUGHS) Hello. Who are you?
