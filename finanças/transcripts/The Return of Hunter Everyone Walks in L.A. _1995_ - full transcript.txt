(gentle music) (birds cawing) - Hey. Race you to the monkey bars. You look like a Klingon that landed on your head on the Venice boardwalk. - Stop showing off and come down from there. (Vicki laughs) (phone ringing) - You okay? - Yeah. (phone ringing) (dial tone ringing) - Hello. - [Dispatcher] Parker Center to four-king-10, patching through to four-king-20. - Four-king-10, over. - Lieutenant, this is Harry McBride. Sir, I'm sorry, I tried to reach you at home, but no go there. I'm actually in your neighborhood now, across the street in the parking lot, the Surf Side Fitness Center. We have a stabbing victim, Caucasian woman, late 20s. Sir, I think you might want to come take a look at this one. - I'll be there in 10 minutes, Harry. Four-king-10 out. (dispatcher chattering on radio) (solemn music) Harry. - Lieutenant. - I gotta tell ya, I don't miss this. - [Harry] No sir. - Stan, what's up? - The victim's name is Rachel Kincaid, age 29. She lives in Marina Del Rey, approximate time of death six hours ago, she was leaving the gym. ME says it looks right-handed. She was cut from the lower right, straight across the upper left. - We talk to family members yet? - We had her boyfriend here till about a half hour ago. We let him go. The rest of the family's back east. - Could he be a suspect? - No sir. - He took one look and coughed up his breakfast. We do have a witness. (siren trills) Blonde lady there, aerobics suit on, saw a white male, late 30s, leaving the lot in a hurry. - Okay, get her to a sketch artist, have the full report on my desk by five o'clock. 5:05 I'm outta there. - Sir, that's some rough life up there on the high command, eh? - It's one of the many perks of being a lieutenant. Carry on, Harry. - Oh man. - Whoa, whoa, don't sit down, this is the gift you had me pick up for Vicki, you have to do the card yourself, that's where I draw the line. - Great. What'd you think of it? - I'm impressed. - Thanks, Lucille. - What did it cost? - Less than she would spend, more than you can afford. - Ah. - Okay, you have a 9:15 robbery homicide meeting, you have a briefing with the deputy chief, and mid-quarter reviews are due at the middle of this month, which is tomorrow. - You're a regular calendar girl, Lucille Banks. - I'll assume that's not a sexist remark for which I'll have to file harassment charges. Oh, oh, oh oh! Your insurance check came in for the earthquake damage! - Ah, great. Been waiting months for this thing. I'm so tired of living out of a box, oh yeah. - Well, if you need anything. - Lucille. Thank you. - Hi Captain. - Hey, Lucille. So, what you got there? - Insurance check, Charlie. - Hmm, about time. - Yeah. - So how you doing? - Not bad for a Thursday. What's on your mind? - Oh, can't a guy come in and say "hello, how are ya?" - Yeah, how are ya? - Great, how about you? - Well, it's Valentine's Day, Charlie, and there was a murder this morning. - Yeah. Hell of a city, huh? - McBride is on it. - I want you to go easy on me. - You lost me. - Tomorrow night at my retirement roast. Everybody's gonna be getting up telling their favorite little anecdote-- - Just a second. You think that I would stand up there and tell some embarrassing story about you? - That's exactly what I'm talking about, and if the Haskill incident is even metioned-- - Yeah, Lucille. - [Lucille] Vicki's on the line. - Well, hold that thought, Johnny. Hi. - Hi, honey. I made great time, I just hope I can get back on the 405 before it becomes a parking lot. - I want you to know that I made reservations for two tonight at eight o'clock at Picaccio's. - Picaccio's? I'm impressed. Dating habits have come a long way, Lieutenant Hunter. - Well, we could go to Denny's, but after all, it is Valentine's Day. - No, no, no, Picaccio's is just fine, hey Dad. - Hi dollface. - Let me talk to Rick. - Tommy wants to say hello. - Did you buy Mom a present? It's Valentine's Day. - Yup, sure did. - What is it? Tell me what it is. - Oh, I can't tell you what it is. Your mom will show you when she gets home. - That's enough, Tommy. Go on upstairs and get changed. - [Tommy] Okay. - Yeah, we saddle up right now, we can go riding before lunch, okay? - All right! - All right! - Listen, I have to swing by the office and then I need to referee the installation at the Brewstein house, he'll love the couches, he'll hate them when he finds out how much they cost. Why don't I just meet you at the restaurant? - That's a good idea. - I love you, Lieutenant Hunter. - I love you. - Bye. - Bye. - Real good to see you, baby. - I can't stay all day. - Well, you're gonna stay for lunch, and then I'm gonna take Tommy fishing and your sister's coming by with the baby, and then you better right Avatar, she's gonna die of neglect. - I love it when you tell me what to do, Dad. I do. - Lucille, where's that store again? - Beverly Drive, south of Wilshire. - I'll be in briefings and then you can clock me out for lunch. - So. - So what? - So tomorrow night. - Oh look, Charlie, tomorrow is your night, your special night, there's no way I'd stand up there and tell an embarrassing story about you. No, no. Your friendship means way, way too much. - Now, I know that's bull, I know what you're up to, Hunter! (birds chirping) - [Clerk] Thank you. - [Frank] A little far west to see you, Lieutenant. - Well, believe it or not, Frank, I know how to find Beverly Hills. How long you been married? - 23 glorious years. - What do you think of that? - Well, I think the size of a ring isn't important, it's the weight of the thought behind it that counts. - You're a true politician, Frank. - I'll take that as a compliment. - It was meant to be one. Oh, and by the way, Frank, listen, I wanna say thank you very much for the help on the Rodriguez case. I never thought you'd push for murder one. - Neither did the Times. That's why I did it. - Law and order look good on the campaign trail, Frank? Especially now. - Oh no no, I'm only the district attorney. I am not officially a candidate for any other office in this state. - How many times a day do you say that? - Oh, as many times as I can, Hunter. (chuckles) Buh-bye, thank you. - Yes. (chuckles) (gentle music) Happy Valentine's Day. - Neiman Marcus? Rick. - Open it. - Oh, Rick. It's gorgeous. - You remember we looked at that the other day? - [Vicki] Yeah. - It's got a cute little place there for your (mumbles). - Yeah, I know. - Oh, your turn. - For me? - Happy Valentine's Day. - Thanks. Uh-oh. This looks like a serious gift. "My Love Forever, Vicki." I must be the luckiest guy in the LAPD. - Oh, yeah. This coming from a man who owned a house on the Northridge fault line. - Oh, listen. I finally got my insurance check. - Oh, great. You know, prices are still low, you should really think about buying something. - Mm-hmm, I was thinking maybe the Hollywood Hills. - Too many mud slides. - Topanga Canyon. - Charlie lost his place there in the fire. - You're right about that. - You should move into my place in Malibu, bank the money. - No, I don't think I could take advantage of a successful professional woman such as yourself. But we could fix that. You could marry me. - Oh, Rick. - What do you say, Vicki? - I say yes. (sinister music) Rick. (car engine starting) (suspenseful music) - Black Mercedes. (Vicki sighs) - Why won't he leave me alone? It's been two years, for god's sake. - I'll take care of this in the morning. (elevator bell dings) (people chattering) - Elizabeth, that looks terrific. - [Elizabeth] Thank you, Harry. - Sam, hi. - Harry. - Hey Lar. - [Man] If you can get a handle on that, I'd really appreciate it, because I've got a meeting with-- - Lieutenant. Sir. I'm afraid we're out of luck on the Kincaid case. The line at the coroner's office was around the block. I did, however, manage to dip into the favor bank and procure this. - Oh, Harry, you are a sweetheart. I knew they had their problems. I didn't think it went this far. - I'm afraid so, sir. Evidently two NBA championships will buy you a sealed file plus a couple hundred hours of community service. - Putting the ball through the hoop is a good thing. Putting yourself through school is even better. Now, if you think this is gonna help you through life better than this, you're gonna be in more foul trouble than you can imagine. Stay in school. There's no better way to get ahead in life. - And cut. Russ, how was that for you? - [Russ] Very nice. - Okay, great, we should move on. Matt, that was terrific. I wanna go one more time with a closer shot, I need about 10 minutes to set it up. - Whatever you need, Steve, I'm all yours. - Thank you, thank you. Russ, let's talk about this next shot. (people chattering) - Hey, Rick. - It's a good message, Matt. - What can I do for you? - Well, you can start off by telling what you were doing prowling around Vicki's house last night. You're lucky I didn't shoot you in your ass. - Look, I still love Vicki, and nothing personal, but it kills me to see you with my family. - And? - And I went by her house on the way home last night and I saw your car in the driveway. - She's afraid of you, Matt. - That is ridiculous, I'd never hurt Vicki. - Your record for domestic violence is well established. - Those records were sealed by the court. - Yes they were. - Anyway, that's all in the past, and actually, it's none of your damn business, is it? - It is now. I've asked Vicki to marry me, Matt. - That so. Has she told Tommy yet? - No, not yet. Look, I understand your feelings, you should understand mine. You can't go to the house anymore. You can't harass her. And you can never, ever lay your hands on her again, you understand me? Those days are over. Nothing personal. (water splashing) (phone ringing) - Hello? - [Rick] Hey, how you doing? - [Vicki] Exhausted. Will you still love me when I'm pregnant and out of shape? - Better believe it. - Good, I can stop peddling. - Listen, I completely forgot about Charlie's retirement party tonight. - How late you think you're gonna be? - Late, this thing isn't even gonna get off the ground till nine or 10 o'clock. - Oh, by the way, did you have a chance to talk to Matt? - Yes. - What'd you say? - Well, I told him to lay off, and I think he got that. I also told him we're getting married. - Oh, Rick. I wish you hadn't have done that, I shoulda been the one to tell him. - I know it, Vicki, you should've, but it just came out, I'm sorry. - It'll be okay, I'll just, I'll call him tomorrow. - I love you. - Yeah. Have fun. (phone beeps) (Vicki sighs) (phone clicks) - And now, from robbery homicide, your favorite funny man, earthquake victim, and a close, close personal friend of Charlie Devane, Lieutenant Rick Hunter. (crowd applauding and cheering) - It's a pleasure for me to be here with Charlie on his night, congratulations Charlie. This evening's dinner would not be complete without the story to end all stories, I think we all know what that is, at least some of us do, and that is the story of Thomas P. Haskill. - Wait a minute now. Come on, you promised me. - Well I know I promised, but it is your night, I'm stuck for a story, besides, we'd all like to hear it, wouldn't we? (crowd applauding and cheering) (sinister music) (intercom buzzing) - Who is it? - Vicki, honey, it's me, I wanna talk to you. - It's late, Matt. - So, are you going to marry Hunter? - Can we please talk about this tomorrow? - No, I wanna talk now. - Matt, forget it, you've been drinking. - Sweetheart. I drove all the way out here. - Please go home. I do need to talk to you, but not right now. Matt? (glass shattering) (Vicki screams) (sinister music) - I'm home, dear. - Get the hell outta here, Matt, before I call the police. - Call the police? I thought they were here. Yo, Mr. Police Officer! - Matt, you're drunk! - Oh, not the detective, must run in the family, huh? Where's Tommy? - He's at my father's for the weekend. I want you to leave. - I don't want you to marry Hunter. I want us to be a family again. I never meant to hurt you and Tommy, you know that. I love you so much. How many times do I have to say I'm sorry? - You're sorry? You break into my house like this? I don't appreciate this, Matt. - Yeah, well I don't appreciate the visit from your little friend, lover boy super cop. Is he really super, huh? Does he wear that gun in bed? Does he pull out those cuffs and does he place you under arrest?! (glass shatters) (Matt grunts) - Get out! - That's more like it. That's my girl. - I'm warning you, Matt, you get the hell out of my house now! - No, I'm warning you! (Vicki grunts) You play on my team or you don't play at all. - Anyway, Thomas P. Haskilll looks right at Charlie, right straight in the face, and says, "listen, you wanted me in the black skirt "and pumps before, why not now, buster?" (audience laughing) (audience applauding) (audience cheering) - [Emcee] Well, that sort of wraps things up, I wanna thank you all for coming tonight. - Let me have a club soda with sherry. - [Emcee] You're welcome to stay around, we've got another, oh, an hour, an hour and a half here. (phone ringing) - Hello? - Hey, Vicki. You all right? - Matt was here. He was drunk. - I'm coming over there. - No, no, no, it's okay, he's gone. It's okay. - I'll be right there. (phone beeps) (phone clicks) (intercom buzzing) - [Vicki] Go away, Matt! (suspenseful music) (banging on door) (line ringing) - [Operator] 911 emergency. - My ex-husband's at my door, he's gonna hit me again. Please. - [Operator] And his name, please? - Matt Sherry. - [Operator] And your address. - It's 7033 Old Malibu Road. (engine roaring) (suspenseful music) (doorknob rattling) (dispatcher chattering on radio) (Vicki shouts) (Vicki screaming) (tires squealing) - Wait a second, Hunter. - Female, white. (sinister music) (solemn music) - I sent McBride and Lewis to pick up Matt Sherry. I just don't know how to tell you how sorry I am, Rick. - Bastard killed her, Charlie. (banging knocker) (dog barking) - [Harry] Matt Sherry? - Yeah? - LAPD. I'm Sergeant Detective Harry McBride, homicide. This is my partner, Detective Stan Lewis. - Evening, Coach. - I'm sorry to have to be the one to inform you that your ex-wife, Vicki Sherry, has been murdered, sir. (solemn music) - What? What the hell are you talking about? - Actually, we're gonna need you to come downtown, we need to ask you a few questions. - Am I under arrest? - Not at this time. - Maybe I should call my attorney. - Maybe you should, sir. - I know, but we're gonna wrap this up just as soon as possible. What time did you say you left the bar again? - Around 11:15. - 11:15 plus 45, so that puts you at the house on Old Malibu Road around midnight. Now you were all angry, and that's when you got in an argument? - I wanted to see my son. - Right, but unfortunately he wasn't there. How long would you say the argument went on for? - 10 minutes. - And that's when you hit her. - Yes. - More than once? - No. - [Michael] My client will seek counseling for his aggressive behavior. - What time did you get to the house the night before, when Lieutenant Hunter saw your car? (Matt sighs) - A little after two in the morning. - Now, how many drinks did you have that night, Coach? - The same number I told you about an hour ago. - And then the following day is when you got in the argument with Lieutenant Hunter? - Argument, no, I think if you'll check your notes, you'll see that we discussed his recent engagement. - And how'd that make you feel? His being engaged to your ex-wife. - How many times do I have to answer the same questions, Michael? - All right, let's review, shall we? Yes he had too much to drink, yes he stopped by to see his ex-wife, yes they had an argument, no he did not kill her. Captain, either charge my client right now or I want him released on his own recognizance. If you're not prepared to make that decision, I suggest you speak with (mumbling). (people chattering) - [Rick] Charlie, I want this case. - That's not gonna happen, department regulations, and besides, we're gonna have to let him go. - No! He's a 187 suspect, you know this! We've got 72 hours to hold this guy, now come on, Charlie, it's been less than 10. - Look, it came from up top and that's all I can say. - Is that the way it's gonna be around here, huh? The mayor calls the DA, the DA calls the chief, the chief calls you and you kick the dog? Is that the way it's gonna be? - If we arrest him and we were wrong, we're gonna get screwed, you know that. - Wrong? Come on, Charlie, you know what time he left the bar, we have the 911 call, there's fingerprints all over the house, for crying out loud, what do you want? - When the DA figures we got enough to charge him, we'll pick him up again, all right? He's not going anywhere, come on, wake up. (people chattering) - Hey. (men shouting) - And I'm gonna prove it! (men shouting) - Rick, come on. Let's go. Come on now, break it up. Come on, that's okay. - [Man] Let's go, come on. - [Man] Come on now, come on. (phone ringing) (horn honking) (people shouting) - Did you kill your ex-wife? - No, I didn't. - Shut up, Matt. - Have you been charged with anything? - My client has not been charged with any crime. He's cooperating completely with the LAPD. (people chattering) - How long were you questioned? - He was detained for four or five hours, he's free to go on his own way now, if you'll excuse us, it's been a long night for all of us. (people shouting) - Are you a suspect at this point, Coach? - [Man] Excuse me please. - I wanna see my son right now. (solemn music) (siren trilling) - This quiet, upscale neighborhood in Bel-Air has been turned upside-down with the events of the last 24 hours. Coach Matt Sherry returned here several hours ago, accompanied by his high-powered attorney Michael Katz. Channel three has learned that the championship coach had previously been arrested for spousal abuse two years ago. Those records reportedly remain sealed in a deal struck with the DA's office. Police sources also confirm that Coach Sherry is the only suspect in the brutal killing of Vicki Sherry at this time. From the hills of Bel-Air, I'm Sally Vogel, Action News 3. - Perfect. They want us over in Malibu in 20 minutes. - Oh god, it's gonna look like I'm at two places at once. All right, come on, we'll take Sunset to PCH. - Let's do it. - I canceled your afternoon meetings. If there's anything you want me to do, Hunter, just ask. (sinister music) - I'd like to go upstairs. (solemn music) - Lieutenant, you really shouldn't be here. - I know, Harry. But I am here. This been printed, Harry? - Yes sir, it has. (gentle music) Lieutenant? It'll be a real circus. - Don't let these people keep you from being a good cop, Harry. From doing your job, you understand me? - Yes sir. Lieutenant? I'm real sorry about what happened. Maybe you oughta go home, get yourself some sleep. - Yeah. - Vicki Sherry lived with her 10-year-old son Tommy in this pricey Malibu beach house, which she received as part of her divorce settlement from Coach Matt Sherry. - Police had apparently been to this residence before in response to 911 emergency calls from Vicki Sherry. - Coach Sherry maintains a mansion in Bel-Air reportedly worth more than $5 million, that house is a good 20-minute drive from the murder site. - Police investigators have returned to this Malibu beach house murder scene looking for any physical evidence that might tie Coach Matt Sherry to the brutal murder of his ex-wife. Roberto, bank that, we'll pick it up in a minute, come on. Lieutenant Hunter! Lieutenant Hunter, is it true you were engaged to the victim? - No comment. - Channel three happen to know you were engaged to Vicki Sherry. - What is your name? - Sally Vogel. - You have a stupid job, Sally. And get that out of my face. - Mr. Sherry is a suspect in this case, but only a suspect. Now, he's been asked not to leave the city, and his attorney has voluntarily given us his passport. - Is it true that Coach Sherry had an argument with his ex-wife the night of the murder? - I will not comment on what went on between the two individuals. - There have been reports that Coach Sherry had previously been charged with spousal abuse and that those records were sealed. - Yeah, well, if the records were sealed I couldn't possibly comment on them, now could I? - Well then they do exist. - I have no comment on that. I've got time for two more questions. - Will his popularity affect your case? - [Frank] I have no comment on that. - Is he the only suspect? - [Frank] I have no comment, Mr. Brody. - Pete, how you doing? - Oh, not bad. Considering. Her sister's taking it really hard. - How's Tommy doing? - Well. Matt came up to see him, and... Did he kill my baby? And when he was here, he swore he didn't do it. I know he loved her. Well, they had problems, but I can't believe he'd do anything like this. I can't believe she's gone. - [Tommy] Rick. - Tommy. (gentle music) (horse whinnying) - They said on TV that my dad killed my mom. I know that's not true. My dad loved my mom. You loved her too, didn't you? - Yes, Tommy, very much. - One night, a man had a dream that he was walking along the beach with the lord. Across the sky, flashed scenes from his life. For each scene, he noticed two sets of footprints in the sand. One belonged to him, and the other to the lord. But during the most troublesome periods, there was only one set of footprints. He asked the lord, "why would you leave me "when I needed you most?" The lord said to the man, "my precious, precious child, "I love you, and I would never leave you "during the times of trial and suffering. "When you see only one set of footprints, "it was then that I carried you." - I'll take Jenny home. (helicopter whirring) (siren wailing) - Hello, Pat. - Rick. I am so sorry. - Thank you. - You know if there's anything I can do. - You can get rid of that press for me. - Yeah, well, I fought it, but every other station's here, so. - Besides, it's a good story, right? - Call me? I'm around if you wanna talk. - Okay. - I can't believe he has the nerve to show up here. - Sorry, do I know you? - Yeah. I was a friend of Vicki's from the gym. I'm so sorry. You have to bring the man who did this to justice. (solemn music) (solemn music) - Hunter, I been looking for you, I finally got this report on the Kincaid case. - Finally, put it on my desk, Lewis. By the way, where's your partner? - Grand jury. On your desk? - Yeah, on the desk. - An interesting twist in the Matt Sherry case as sources confirm that Vicki Sherry, the murder victim, was engaged to be married to Rick Hunter, a lieutenant in the Los Angeles police department. It is believed that that announcement of their impending marriage may have triggered Matt Sherry's actions the night of the murder. - Lieutenant. - Harry. You got a minute? - Always. - Battaglia have a case there? - Judging by the TV coverage and the media, yeah, absolutely. - I mean does he have hard evidence? - Well, no, no. But what he's trying to do is get the grand jury to indict with what we have right now. - That's good. - Well no, not necessarily, no, since everybody knows that Frank's been trying to build this case in the press, and all he's gotta do is just push it just a little bit further and public opinion's going the other way. And sir, I mean, I don't know if you're aware of this, but Frank's the one who leaked the information about spousal abuse to that reporter, Sally Vogel? - Battaglia did that? - Yes sir, and I can tell you where and when. How about midnight at the Bel-Air Hotel. Rumor around here says that Sally and Frank have been going out for almost a year. So hard evidence or not, Matt Sherry's gonna be a tough guy to convict in this town. - Why hasn't my client been arrested? And why are they taking this to the grand jury and not a preliminary hearing? I'll tell you why, because they don't want us there. My client is innocent, and when that is made clear, this city is going to have to pay for damaging the reptutation of a national here. Thank you, that'll be all for today, folks. (reporters shouting) Lieutenant Hunter. Sorry about your loss, it's a terrible tragedy. - Thank you very much. - Look, I know you think Matt Sherry killed his ex-wife, he didn't. - Let me ask you something, Counselor. How much money does it take to get off after you've murdered somebody? A million, $2 million? All the killer has? What is it, the sliding scale or what? - Lieutenant, there was no weapon, no witnesses, none of Matt Sherry's blood was found at the crime scene, you don't even have enough for an indictment, much less a conviction. - A conviction? You can't convict anybody in this town of anything anymore. No, let me tell you about Los Angeles, Counselor. Two brothers decide to murder their rich parents in cold blood, they confess, no problem, as long as they do it in LA, no conviction. Two punks decide to throw a brick through a truck driver's head during a riot. No problems, as long as the riot's in Los Angeles. - Lieutenant-- - No, four police officers are caught on videotape beating a black motorist. Turns into a race issue. They're tried twice. They're convicted of violating his civil rights? No, the truth is, Counselor, everybody walks in LA. - Very well. I'll see you in court, Hunter. - I'm bringing in Jerry Lands from Dallas and Jack Garrett from New York, he's a DNA expert. I've gotta call in Dershowitz in case we have to appeal a conviction, and I've hired Bernard Daly Bernard to do the PR. - I have a publicist. - Well these guys aren't publicists, Matt, they're opinion makers and spin doctors, and that's just what we need right now. (horn honking) - Michael, I didn't kill her. - Of course you didn't, Matt. (phones ringing) (people chattering) - Hold all my calls, Lucille. (door closes) (solemn music) (mysterious music) - This is Sally Vogel reporting live from the mansion of Coach Matt Sherry in Bel-Air, where friends, neighbors, and even total strangers continue to express their grief and outrage over the brutal murder of Coach Sherry's estranged wife, Vicki. Everyone seems to have an opinion in this bizarre case, which has captured the imaginations of not only Los Angeles, but of the entire nation. - He did it, man, he did it. He was pumped up on Jones and he wasted her, you know? If you ask me, I think it was drug-related. That's just my own personal theory. - He was abusing her. He was jealous that she was engaged to this police officer, and he went wild. I don't care if he's President of the United States, if he did it, then he should go to jail. - No, Matt Sherry is a winner. I've always liked him, on the court, off the court, there's no way he's gonna foul out of a game like that. Trust me, he didn't do it. - Thanks for your time. - My pleasure. - Just what we need, more hero worshipers like that guy. Oh, find me a yuppie who can't believe he did it. - Jeez, can you believe these people? - You watch, he'll get off. All the defense'll need is one juror who's a fan to get a hung jury. Santa Claus could be a mass murderer and he'd walk if he did the crime wearing the little red suit. - You are a fountain of insight, Miss Vogel. (both chuckle) - Come on, next victim. - Okay, now, I mean, it amazes me anybody could think that this guy is guilty. You look at him. I mean, he's got amazing charisma, he's a sharp guy, every guy I know wants to be Matt Sherry. I mean, think about it, really. He's rich, he's successful, he's a nice guy, everyone loves him. Why would he be so stupid as to throw away his life like that? No way, not the coach, absolutely no way. (solemn music) - [Sally] Once again looking for any physical evidence that might tie Coach Matt Sherry to the brutal murder of his ex-wife. - Excuse me. - Just a minute, I'm really into this. - [Sally] Lieutenant Hunter, Lieutenant Hunter. - No comment. - [Sally] Is it true that you were engaged to the victim? - I'm Lieutenant Hunter, LAPD. - Oh, hey, you're the cop-- - That's right, that's me. Like to ask you a couple questions about Rachel Kincaid? - Oh god, that poor thing. - Now when you were questioned the day after the murder, you said that you were off that night. - Yeah, I had the flu, I was out a couple days. - Ever see that man before? - I don't think so. - [Rick] You're sure? I mean, he wasn't working out here, he wasn't outside hanging around, any place? - No. But we get a lot of people in here 'cause we're open all night. - I see. Did you know Vicki Sherry? - Only from TV. When did you put on the guard? - Well, the next day after Rachel got killed. - Would it be possible to get a complete membership list from here? - Sure, no problem. Mind if I ask you a question? Why haven't you arrested Matt Sherry? I mean, everyone knows he did it. (solemn music) (phone ringing) (line ringing) - [Rick] Hello? - Lieutenant Hunter. What brings you out so late? - Who's this? - Just a friend with a mutual interest. Catching the killer of Vicki Sherry and Rachel Kincaid. - Yeah, what do you want? - I just want to express my condolences, I mean, Vicki was a lovely woman. She looked so cute in that red Stanford T-shirt. See, that's what she was wearing when I came to the door. Let me think, was that in the newspaper? You know, not that I recall. - Hey, who the hell are you? - Everybody's gonna know my name before this is over. I'm gonna be famous, just like you. - Where are you? - You'll figure that out. - [Rick] Hey, who are you? What do you know about Vicki Sherry? (suspenseful music) (gunshot bangs) (gun clicks) - [Charlie] Vicki's death is tied to this Rachel Kincaid and the guy confessed on the phone? - [Rick] That's what he said. - Well, you know what you're saying, you're saying that Matt Sherry didn't kill Vicki. - It looks that way, Charlie. - I wonder what Battaglia's gonna tell the grand jury now. - Well, I don't know, but it should be interesting. - Captain, the uniforms did find one shell casing from a 308 on the roof of the gym. - They're running ballistics now. - I think we oughta close that gym down, at least temporarily. - That's a good idea. Stan, how'd this guy find my number? - Probably scanned off of ESN. We can put a trace on your line, triangulate it if he calls again. - Lieutenant, piece of cake on the sailors. - Good, let's do that, huh? This is our boy. Run that through NCI computers. Find out everything you can on this guy. Harry, we got a lot of work to do, let's go. (siren wailing) (people chattering) (reporters shouting) - Lieutenant Hunter! Assuming Matt Sherry's indicted, do you think the DA should push for the death penalty? - Let me tell you something, Sally, everybody has a right to a fair trial. That takes place in the courts, not on network television, not on CNN. Matt Sherry hasn't even been indicted yet, and you people have him packing his bags for San Quentin. - But Lieutenant Hunter-- - Just a sec. - That sounds strange coming from the fiance of the victim. - I'm still a police officer. You do your jobs, let us do ours. (people chattering) - All right, let's call Pat Lafferty at the station and get that six o'clock lead slot cleared. Woo, we just won the sound byte of the month. - [Pat] How do you like being the center of all this attention? - Well, I don't, Pat. I wish you people would keep my picture the hell off the TV, make my job a lot easier. - It's your 15 minutes, Rick. - How's that? - Andy Warhol, you know, he predicted all of us would eventually have 15 minutes of fame. - He's dead, isn't he? - Yes, he is. But his 15 minutes came before he died. - Ms. Lafferty, with all due respect, I don't understand how you people are allowed to just say whatever you want and then chalk it up to a police informant or an unknown source. - Because that's the way they want it. - Right, who's they? - The lawyers, the police department, you guys wouldn't believe the stuff that's being leaked to us every day on this case. - [Rick] Like the DA's office leaking sealed documents on Matt Sherry's arrest? - Now you're fishing, Rick. - Am I? - Sorry to interrupt. Larry, I need you to pull up the raw footage on the Sherry file, I think it's on eight. - Yeah, sure, give me five seconds. - Lieutenant Hunter. Taking the studio tour? - No, actually I thought I'd just come by and see you. - Oh, well good, you can watch the news with me. You're the lead story at six o'clock. (people chattering) - Let me tell you something, Sally, everybody has a right to a fair trial. But that takes place in the courts, not on network television or CNN. Now, Matt Sherry hasn't even been indicted yet, and you people have him packing his bags for San Quentin. - But Lieutenant Hunter-- - Just a second. - [Sally] That sounds a little strange coming from the fiance of the victim. - Still a police officer. You do your jobs, let us do ours. - Do you have to run that? - Did you have to say it? - Here's your funeral stuff. (people chattering) - Yeah, that's him. - Back it up, Larry. - Backing it up, fasten your seat belts. - I know that face. - How? - I did a pop of him yesterday at the Sherry mansion. Something about fouling out of the game. - Could I see that? - Yeah, Larry, pull last night's 11 o'clock piece, the one we fed to the network? - [Larry] Yeah, you got it. (tape rewinding) - What's going on? - He's executing a court order, Sally, that's all I can tell you. - [Sally] A court order on the Matt Sherry case? - You do ask an awful lot of questions, don't you? - That's why they pay me the moderate bucks. - No, Matt Sherry is a winner, I've always liked him, on the court, off the court, there's no way he's gonna foul out of the game like that. Trust me, he didn't do it. - Harry? I want to know everything I can about that guy. - Yes! Gotcha, pay up. - Two out of three. - This is for the championship of the world. That's never two out of three. - All right, champ. Come on, I'll buy you a soda over there, huh? - Can you explain something about hockey to me? - Well, if it's about the strike, Tommy, I don't think I can. - No, no, I understand that. That's just people being greedy. What I don't get is off-sides. - In hockey? - Yeah. Could you straighten that out for me? - Yeah, sure. Off-sides in hockey. When a guy wants to take a shot when he's past the blue line, I think it's a blue line. Anyway, there has to be a guy between him and the goal. - But the goalie's between him and the goal. - I know, there's gotta be another guy, though. (phone ringing) - Why? - Well, I don't know, I think it's something that some Canadian figured out a long time ago, huh? Excuse me. Yeah, Hunter. - Lieutenant. Turns out Jack Valko is the name that goes with the face. I got an address on him over here in Westwood, his sister's old apartment. Now why don't I meet you in front of the Village Theater? - All right, Harry, good work. Give me 25 minutes, I'll meet you there. (people chattering) (horn honking) (reporters shouting) - [Reporter] Lieutenant Hunter, we're live! Do you have a statement? - Open the gate! (people chattering) - [Reporter] Come on, now! Come on, we got a job to do! - [Man] For crying out loud. - [Reporter] Lieutenant Hunter! - Hey, kiddo, how was the pier? - It was awesome. Me and Rick must have played every game in the place. It was great, wasn't it, Rick? - Sure was, Tommy. Thanks son. - I had a great time. Thank you. - Thank you. Matt. I know what this ordeal has done to you. - You have no idea what it's done to me. - Hang in there. - What does that mean? (solemn music) (horn honking) - What do you got, Harry? - Jack Valko, no car, no DMV. Served seven years for a killing up in Seattle. Used a knife. The warden up at Walla-Walla says that our boy'd do just about anything to get his face on TV. Hunger strikes, prisoner's rights, you name it. Oh, and get this, one time he incited a near-riot over the viewing privileges of a TV show called Cops in the convicts' lounge. Oh no, he's just a stand-up guy. I mean, he's a gem. I mean, evidently, he derives some kind of perverse pleasure out of all this lurid media coverage. - Don't we all. - Well yeah, but Valko's shrink told us that he's just doing all this stuff for a little attention. He actually wants to get caught. - Well, if he actually wants to get caught, why doesn't he just turn himself in? (people chattering on television) Harry. - Clear, Hunter. Look at this, Lieutenant. Valko's got himself two police scanners. Whole routine. - This guy's sick. (phone ringing) Hello. - Welcome to my humble home. - Silent alarm? - Very good. - I'm impressed, Jack, can you tell? - Oh, you know my name, huh? - [Rick] Oh, I know all about you, Jack, your TV appearances. - You know I saw you on TV, Hunter, standing up for the rights of the accused, very noble. - And I saw you too, Jack. Standing out in front of Matt Sherry's mansion. - I thought I came off rather well, don't you? Passionate, distinct, great flair for metaphor? - Oh, I don't know, I think you come off better in person. - Ah, Vicki's funeral, yeah. I'm glad we had a chance to meet. - We should do it again sometime. - So why did you close down my gym, Hunter? I'm concerned about those beautiful women, how are they gonna stay in shape? - Why'd you pick that place, Jack? - Because all the nice ones work out at night. I gotta go. - Jack. When I do get my hands on you, there's not gonna be any speeches for the rights of criminals. (phone clicks) Harry? - We got him. (people chattering) - [Reporter] Lieutenant Hunter, Channel 6 News. Do you have any significant leads? - Thank you very much. Excuse me. - [Reporter] Lieutenant Hunter, excuse me, I'll just ask you one question, please. (intercom buzzes) - Yeah? - [Receptionist] Lieutenant Hunter's here to see you, sir. - All right, send him in. (knocking on door) Well, Lieutenant Hunter, come on in, I've got a few minutes before my next press conference. Lorraine, this is Rick Hunter, Lorraine. - Lorraine. - Listen, first of all, Rick. I'd like to express my condolences. I know how close you two were and about your plans for the future. Listen, I want you to understand that this whole Matt Sherry matter is a lose-lose situation for me. - Yeah, how's that? - Well, if he goes to jail, I'll never get reelected, much less run for higher office, and if he walks, the whole country'll be crying, "no justice for the rich." - No, actually, it's a win-win for you. You see, no matter what happens to Matt Sherry, it's good for Frank Battaglia. And besides, Frank, Matt Sherry didn't do it. I have a very strong lead on another suspect. (intercom buzzes) - What! - [Reporter] The press is waiting for you, sir, they've assembled in the rotunda area. - I'm on my way. Well what the hell do you want me to do, Hunter? - I wouldn't let public opinion dictate my actions, Frank. And I'd be very, very careful of what I say to certain members of the press. Fix him up good, Lorraine, he looks a little pale. - No. (dispatcher chattering on radio) - There's three there. Why don't you check it out? - Can do. (people chattering) (bicycle bell ringing) - That's it. That's our boy's phone. 555-7295. (solemn music) - Let's make that call now. - This is four-king-20, requesting you proceed with the crime broadcast, repeating it every 30 seconds. Repeating it every 30 seconds, out. - [Dispatcher] I roger, four-king-20. - Hope he's listening to the police scanner. - He's listening, all right. - [Dispatcher] All units in the vicinity of Ocean Front Walk in Venice, APB for suspect Jack Valko, V for Valko, white male, 35, five-11, 170, suspect wanted in multiple murders, is believed to be a dimwitted media freak, a miserable pedophile, a sexual deviant, and a general no-class low-life piece of pond scum. (dispatcher chattering on radio) (tense music) - That him? - Yeah, that's him. - Get outta here! (phone ringing) (dispatcher chattering) - Hello, Jack. - What the hell is that crap on the radio, Hunter? I thought we had a relationship here. - Don't be so sensitive. We have a relationship. After all, you are wanted for murder. - I'll just get a good lawyer, that's all you need in LA, you know? - Now look, Jack, my partner would like to have a word with you. - Mr. Valko, hi. - I don't wanna talk to you. - Hey listen, that was quite an impressive setup you had in Westwood there. Those TVs and VCRs, I mean, truth be told, I don't even know how to set a timer. - Yeah, put Hunter back on. - In two seconds here, I'd just like to take this opportunity to ask you a programming question. - Where's Hunter! - [Harry] He'll be right with ya. Now, I'm the kind of (dramatic music) to watch one show while I'm taping. (suspenseful music) (tires squealing) - Hey! - Whoa, hey! - Four-king-20, officer in pursuit of perp on foot heading south of Venice boardwalk, requesting backup. (tires squealing) Valko! (tires squealing) (horn honking) Come on! (horn honking) Four-king-20, officer still in need of assistance. - Get out! Get out now! Move it! (tires squealing) (suspenseful music) You wanna play, Hunter? We'll play! (tires squealing) - Lieutenant! (crashing) (explosions booming) (crowd applauding) - [Woman On Intercom] Dr. Kahn to OR two. - You know what was weird out there today, Charlie, people just stood there cheering. Didn't seem to make any difference that there could've been a man in that car dying. It was like some weird perverted stunt show they were watching. They just stood there, applauding. - You've become the show, huh? Half those people probably recognized you from the tube. That's the way the world is today. Believe me. People are sick. Listen, you got a minute? - [Rick] Yeah, sure. - You know, I kinda wish that I'd been out there with you guys today, does that sound crazy? - [Rick] No. - Well anyway, started me thinking about the job. The rewards of doing the job, the department. I realized how important it is to me. You and I are cops, Hunter. That's what we're supposed to be. What happened to Vicki made me sort of rethink a lot of things in my life. And anyway, I've decided I'm not gonna retire. I'm in for the long haul, so, let's get this guy. - Welcome back, Charlie. (people chattering) Get Pete Morgan on the phone for me, would you please? (light music) - [Bartender] Here you go. - Thank you. Pete, there's something I've been wanting to talk to you about. And I wanted to tell you personally. - What is it? - There's been a lot of things said in the press about Vicki's death and Matt. I just want you to hear it from me. Matt didn't do it. - How you know that? - Because we have a lead on the guy that did. - You sure? - Yeah, he's confessed to two killings. Vicki's and a woman by the name of Rachel Kincaid. - Does Matt know about this? - [Rick] No, not yet. (Pete sighs) You know, this is such great news. Tommy's gonna have a place to go home to. - Yes he will. - Wait, this guy that did it is still out there? - Yes he is, Pete, but not for long. - I don't know where we're heading, you know? People's emotions are running wild because of something somebody tells 'em on TV. - Look, Pete. I thought Matt did it. I mean, everything pointed to it. - Thank god he didn't. Boy, that would've been too much to take. Listen, shorty. You're always gonna be part of my family. (both patting) (tense music) (phone ringing) - Hunter. - [Jack] That's a very touching picture, Hunter. Who's the old guy, Vicki's dad? - Where are ya, Jack? You sound close. - Oh, I'm very close. Listen, I enjoyed our little chase this morning. You're in better shape than I thought. - Why don't we get together real soon, I'll show you what kind of shape I'm really in. - Well, to tell you the truth, I'm really unhappy. See, I don't feel I'm getting the coverage I deserve. Matt Sherry's getting all my air time, that's your fault. - Well, why don't you turn yourself in? I guarantee you'll be all over the news. - You know, I saw Matt Sherry drive away from the house that night. If I'd have gotten there 10 minutes earlier and heard their argument, I never woulda killed her. Not if I knew people might think he did it. - I'm gonna kill you, Jack. - Is that right? Oh, by the way, that reminds me, I've been a bad boy, sorry. But as you know, I have this desperate need for attention. - Now you listen to me. - No, you shut up! You listen to me! There is a dead girl in an alley behind the promenade because you closed my gym. I want my 15 minutes of fame, dammit! Now for every day you don't catch me, there'll be one more girl. I want you to think about that tonight when you're alone in bed. Do that for me, Hunter. (eerie music) (cameras clicking) (siren wailing) (dispatcher chattering on radio) - Absolutely not, Lieutenant, I got a tide of public opinion against this man. - Who happens to be innocent. - Maybe he's innocent. So you want me to announce to the whole country that Matt Sherry is no longer a suspect and some crackpot that's calling you on the phone is the killer. - Yeah. - No. - Wait a minute, if we don't do something to stop this guy, someone else is gonna get killed. - And let me tell you something, if you don't do it, I will, and I don't give a damn about the repercussions. - Charlie, if you are so sure that this guy did it, bring him in. Alive. - [Charlie] Rick, he said alive. - How you feeling, Sergeant? (solemn music) - Who are you? - You know me. Remember we talked on the phone right before your accident? (Harry moans) Looking for this? Just wanted to see if you're all right. Why haven't you told the world the truth about Matt Sherry? About me? - We decided not to do you any favors. - Wall to wall, every station, all I see is that lousy basketball coach, that oughta be me. - He won a few more games than you did. - I think I could push my numbers up. - I think that that would be a mistake on your part. - Do you? Well, I guess that's up to your boss, isn't it? - Do you have any idea what Lieutenant Hunter's gonna do to you? - Yeah, he delivered that little news flash. Listen, I'm gonna leave you the address of a motel in West Hollywood. Little something there for ya. Even Hunter can't screw this one up. (eerie music) You rest. (solemn music) (eerie music) Evening, Lieutenant Hunter. I wanted to make this a face-to-face meeting, but you get so stressed whenever we get together. I really wanted to make this tape to officially confess. See, I killed Rachel Kincaid outside the gym. Vicki Sherry was next on the list, but they put a security guard in front of the gym and I just had to go to Malibu, so anyway. This is the murder weapon. I'm sure even your lame forensics department can confirm that. I'll leave it around here for you someplace, I don't know. Maybe the wishing well, maybe not. You'll find it. But I want you to listen very carefully. I want this tape broadcast on all the networks within 24 hours. Matt Sherry looks so distressed. I want to relive him of the burden of being falsely accused of a crime he didn't commit. My crime. My crime. Now, for every day this tape is delayed, what am I talking, you know the deal. Listen, I gotta go, so I'll see you on Cops. - We'll put that tape on the air. - Shut that off! - Lieutenant Hunter, isn't it true you have another suspect in the Matt Sherry case? - I said shut it off. - Keep rolling. - [Rick] Give me that. - Oh. - Hey, be careful with that. - How'd you two guys find me? - We got an anonymous call at the station, guy said he was a friend of yours from Venice. - Uh-huh. I'm confiscating this tape as evidence of an ongoing police investigation. - Well hey, you have no right. - Shut up. - Wait a minute, you are way outta line here. - Yeah, and you're gonna get somebody killed. Give me your wrists. - What do you think you're doing? - You're under arrest. - For what? - Obstruction of justice and interfering with a police officer's investigation. - Oh, you gotta be kidding! - Does it look like I'm kidding? Have a good night. - You are in big trouble, Hunter! (door closes) (eerie music) - I know how to catch him. First of all, let me just say that I had very good reason for handcuffing you to the bed post that night. I was in hot pursuit of a 187 suspect, and I did not want to jeopardize the life of a civilian. - Even me? - Even you. Albeit my behavior was a little-- - Rash? - Rash. Apology accepted? Great. Now I have a deal for you. - And what's in it for us? - Exclusive footage of the capture of the killer of Vicki Sherry. - And what do you want? - A little help with some editing? (solemn music) - All right, Tracy, thank you. Repeating our top story from five o'clock, we have a late-breaking development in the Matt Sherry case. For all the details, let's go to Sally Vogel at the pond in Anaheim. Sally. - The focus of the Matt Sherry investigation has shifted to the pond in Anaheim tonight, where Coach Sherry reports to work every day. Investigators believe that the still-unfound murder weapon may be located somewhere inside this massive building. In yet another bizarre twist-- - No. - Channel three has exclusive footage from a man claiming to be the killer of Vicki Sherry. I'm standing here with Lieutenant Rick Hunter, who is, as you all know, the LAPD officer who was engaged to Vicki Sherry. Lieutenant Hunter, I know you were opposed to us broadcasting this tape, but could you tell me what you make of this bizarre confession? - It's complete nonsense, and it's irresponsible of you people to put this guy on the air. He's a sick, whacked out media freak. We have hundreds of tapes like this. People confessing to everything from the Manson killings to the kidnapping of the Lindbergh baby. - We do? - Are you having any luck in your search for the murder weapon? - We're cautiously optimistic. - And do you anticipate an arrest any time soon in this case? - Yes I do. - [Sally] Okay, let's roll the tape. - Here's the murder weapon. I killed Rachel Kincaid, that's my crime. I want this tape broadcast on all the networks. Vicki Sherry was next on the list. Matt Sherry looks so distressed. My crime. I'll see you on Cops. I'll see you on Cops. I'll see you on Cops. No! - Well, there you have it, a strange case gets even stranger. And if there's any more of you out there with taped confessions, do us a favor and send them to channel six. Reporting live-- (Jack shouting) I'm Sally Vogel for Action News 3. Back to you... (electricity buzzing) (television set crashes) (tense music) - Been expecting you, Jack. - You made a fool outta me. - I made a fool outta you? Did what you asked, put you on television. - Are we alone? - It's just me and you. - Well, why don't you come out and play, Hunter? (gun clicks) - Sealed off every exit, Jack. No way out, just me and you. (gunshot bangs) (suspenseful music) Jack, I'm gonna say this one time. Drop your weapon and lay face down on the floor, put your hands behind your back. (gunshot bangs) I'm gonna take that as a no. (gunshots banging) (electricity buzzes) (Rick grunts) (Rick groans) - Very persistent, Hunter. Hang on, Hunter. They got a home game on Tuesday. - Valko. I have confession to make. I lied. We're not alone. See 'em down near the lights? The media, they're all for you. - Getting anything? - This is your 15 seconds of fame, Jack. - It's 15 minutes, you idiot. - No. I think I got it right in your case. You're gonna spend the rest of your life in jail, Jack. (cameras clicking) You know how hard it is for me not to kill you? (Jack laughing) - I gotta go. (Jack shouting) (cameras clicking) (Jack shouting) (glass shattering) (people gasping) (cameras clicking) (people chattering) - I got the whole shot. (cameras clicking) - We knew from the start that Matt Sherry was innocent, and that's why we delayed in asking the grand jury for an indictment. Now what we had here was a media frenzy, without the benefit of the facts that we had in hand. Now, any questions, anybody? - [Reporter] Sir, are you running for United States Senator? - Remind me to keep up with this guy, will you? - Yeah, right. (chuckles) - No no no, I'm just glad this whole ordeal has ended and I can turn my attention back to my son. And my team. I'm very grateful to Lieutenant Rick Hunter for encouraging me to seek counseling regarding my inexcusable behavior towards women. (solemn music) - Hey, how was the fishing, buddy? - [Tommy] It was great. - Ah, that's good, that's good. - Matt. - Thanks. - [Vicki] My darling Lieutenant Hunter. I know it's awfully formal of me to write you a thank you note, but it's something I was always nagged to do by my mother, may she rest in peace. The ring is so beautiful, but not nearly as beautiful as you. It symbolizes the happiness you've brought to me, and will always be a constant reminder of the place you hold in my heart. Together we will have the family we've always talked about. Again I say yes to your proposal. My love forever, Vicki. (solemn music) (solemn music)
