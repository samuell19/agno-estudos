1! 2! 3! Hello. Okay. Shaina from Mumbai. - Let her hold. Kill her. Yes! Give me. Don Gani.. - Yes, Shaina, tell me. Don Gani, l was trying to contact you. - Yes, go ahead. Golden has been murdered and there is a blood bath happening here. You guys don't do anything. l'm coming to Mumbai the day after tomorrow. Tony here. Gani is coming to Mumbai the day after tomorrow. Confirmed? Hundred per cent. 'To rein in the crime in Mumbai..' '..the government has roped in the lG of Punjab police..' '..Mr. Ashraf Taufiq Khan and appointed him..' '..the new police commissioner of Mumbai.' 'He will hold a meeting with top police officials today.' Who is this Golden? He's a big name in Mumbai underworld. Two third of Mumbai is controlled by Golden and his gang. Kidnapping, contract killing, extortion, land grabbing. This is what the gang does. This gang is run by a person called Gani, not Golden. He operates this gang from outside lndia. Don Gani. - Yes, tell me. Your job will be done. We got information from the intelligence report.. ..that in the terrorist attack on Mumbai last week.. ..Gani used his local gang to help the terrorists.. ..come via the sea route. He never stays in the country for too long. That's why he has not been caught till now. And who is Datta Pawale? Datta Pawale used to be work for Gani. Tie him to a rock and throw him in. He built his own gang. He does the same kind of work as Golden's gang. But on a smaller scale. His right hand's name is Shiva. He operates in the area around Versova. Every other day there's a gang war between them. Some from the police department are hand-in-glove with them. And both gangs have political support. We arrest them in the morning. But they get released by evening. Come on. Get in. Unless we finish the Mumbai underworld and these local gangs.. ..this city can't be safe from foreign terrorists. 'The moment Ashraf Khan took charge..' '..he started operations against the mafia.' 'ln the past 48 hours more than 200 goons have been arrested..' '..and eight dangerous goons have been shot dead.' 'Because of Commissioner Ashraf's tough stand..' '..against the Mumbai underworld, the gangsters are really frightened.' 'Ashraf Khan says it's his dream to make Mumbai crime free.' 'And to do this, he will not worry about..' '..political or bureaucratic pressure.' We have to take care of a man. - Who? Genghis. - The one from Ghatkopar? - Yes. We have to beat him up in his locality. Money. Which one of you will beat him up? Radhe. "He's wanted." ls he any good? He's more ruthless than Rambo. More destructive than Terminator. Smarter than Rocky and Quicker than Bruce Lee. He's the last action hero. Stop! Nab him! You scoundrel! Stop there! - Stop! "He's wanted." The stuff is here brother. They are just too many. Go get some more money. Okay. Excuse me. Move aside. Hey! Who are you? You won't get beaten up without knowing my name? So you've taken the contract to beat me up? Once l take a contract, l don't listen to myself even. You fool. Can't you see how many men are with me? Pigs always hunt in groups. And a tiger hunts alone. Shankar, pull down the shutters. Brother.. Keep it slightly open. He might find it useful while escaping. Stop! Move aside! You'll die today. You've made a big mistake by throwing away the key. Hey, what will you do? What? l swear on your mother. Today, you won't be able to crawl out of here, let alone walk out. You're swearing on my mother? Now that l've sworn on her.. - You swore on my mother.. l'll keep it. - You.. Brother. l'll break the lock as well as your jaw. No! No! "My charisma". "l want the magic." "Here and there." "One. Two.

"Charisma.." "That's right." "Charisma.." "Let me show you how to make the world bow to you." "Let me show you how to make the world bow to you." "lf you're courageous like me, the world will be afraid of you." "Be it a storm or a hurricane." "nothing can stand in front of me." "My charisma.." "One. Two. Three. Four." "Here and there." "lt will be all around the world. What!" "Your charisma.." "All rise." "To the rhythm and the beats." "So high." "This is your charisma. - Charisma.." Do the rock and roll some night." "All rise." "To the rhythm and the beats." "So high." "This is my charisma. - Charisma.." Do the rock and roll some night." "Do the rock and roll." "Come on, do your magic." Hello, tell me.. Hey, stupid.

She lives in the neighbourhood. She's throwing me glances. What kind of a girl will be interested in you. She's a cat. - Really? Someone like me won't get a Miss World or Miss Universe. l have only one principle. Try to woo the least beautiful girl in the group. She gets enticed quickly. And she won't betray you in love. You fool. lf you run after the girl.. ..the girl will take your money and run. lf you chase money, the girl will chase you. Excuse me! l don't agree with you. Don't look at my face. Look in my eyes. There's so much truth in them. Your eyes express what your heart wants to say. Right. l love you very much. ls it? l love you very much. Really? You love me, too, don't you? Then, why don't you express it? l'm scared. You're in love. Don't get scared. "When you're in love why get scared?" "You've loved, it's no.." That was superb!
