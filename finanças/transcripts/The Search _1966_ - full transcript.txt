At the end of the 19th century, Spain woke from the dream of Restoration a dream which began with the coronation of Alfonso XII. The men of the Restoration truly believed that the fraternal struggles, which had lasted 50 years were now behind them. They believed that Spain would have a future full of progress and happiness. The so-called Colonial Disaster put an end to those dreams. Our country, no longer a colonial power, with a socially and technically backward agricultural system, with weak industries, with a constantly growing population, faced a modern world in the worst possible situation. It seemed that that world developed and that we stagnated. The men of the Restoration didn't understand the working world. Workers demanded higher salaries, improved living conditions, social security and unemployment pay. In their speeches, government officials, claimed that the working class was a victim of betrayals, tricks and absurd illusions. In the streets, the idea of "social issues" emerged. Even if one could rise up from the working class to a position privilege, many would fall from the working class to delinquency. Thousands of emigrants from the country, forced into the cities by hunger, created an overwhelming army of misery and ignorance. Among the workers and delinquents there was a motley group of beggars, prostitutes, scoundrels, layabouts, pickpockets... This is the world where Manuel, a young man who came to Madrid, began his struggle to survive. For him, just as for his country, the future represented a mixture of threat, uncertainty, and confusion. THE SEARCH Film freely inspired by the novel of the same name by Pio Baroja. BOARDING HOUSE ENTRANCE - You could knock, Petra. - Knock! Claro, it's not every day that young men end up here... You knock, pig, you're the one who should let us know when you're there! Sit down. - May I? - You're hungry? -Yes. As you see, everything here is measured and counted. But where have you gone, Petra? - He's your son? -Yes, he's mine. - I figured as much. - But where's he going to go here? - It won't be for long. Anyway, he won't be a bother. He can serve food or take messages... - He can stay. - Thank you, Ms. Casiana. Don't thank me. - And you know it won't be for long. - Yes, ma'am. You heard, right? Some gift from you and your uncles. Tell me what happened. Your uncle didn't tell me anything. What have you done? - Me, nothing. -Then why did you get sent here so suddenly? He said he'd tell you in a letter. It's true, mother, he asked me which I preferred: to stay in the village or come to Madrid. - I said come to Madrid. - To Madrid, of course. - And what am I to do with you...? - Look how young he is. Get out of here! You should be ashamed! Hey, country boy, are you serving the table or just hanging around? - Calm down, don Aurelio. - But don't talk politics, gentlemen. What most impresses me is the smell of this burnt meat. - I saw that Cuba business coming. - Believe me, there are worse things. - What? -The saddest thing is that when we came back, we were ignored. What did you expect? To be carried on their shoulders? In the end, you got a good beating. Like they say, "if you had guts, a rooster would have made you sing. " - That's it, just guts. - But you're all still doing fine. Help me. Let's go. - You make a lot of money, right? - Money? Do you think if I earned good money I would live here? No one here has a dime. - Bring me some water, son. The glasses are in the sink. Are you trying to kill me? - But, but... what did I do, mother? - You have the nerve to ask? - I didn't do anything. -Be quiet, others will hear. Go to bed, now. Everything's fine. Just tell your teacher. Don't worry, ma'am. You'll have it. - We'll see... -You'll have it... - Thank you. -Goodbye. - Bye, Justita. - Shall we go? Hey, boy. Bring me a glass of water. Come on, hurry! Let's go, dear. No, no, no. You have to go up now. - Where are you coming from, scamp? - What? -I already saw you. - You like the girl? -Well... - Sure, she's very pretty. Don't just stand there, come in. You know, you're very handsome yourself. My word, how timid you are. Don't listen to her. Here, I'll give you something you'll like. - You'll like it a lot. - Ok. Pardon me. Have a seat. Sit down. This will make your cares go away. - I'll give you a bit. - Thanks. - You want to take care of me? - No... How old are you? Tell me. Everyone here is down on their luck. Ms. Casiana is a bitch. And since you'll be here for a while... You'll get yourself dirty. Drink, you'll get used to it. I went to Cuba when I was young, I was sick of being tired and hungry all the time, and for a moment over there, I had everything. I've also been to New Orleans. You know where that is? Well... no. I had a song that was very popular. All the men would follow me around. A woman with all this, and who's as happy as me, will always attract men in the street. When I left Havana God help me... Come back soon. - I have to open the... - But come back. - Well, can I pass? - Oh, sure. Here. Give me that, I'll help you. - Will you? -Leave it here. I'll come right back. - Ok, there it is. Could I? - Here. -What a nasty woman. Listen... - What are you going to do now? - I'll bring this suit. - Are you coming? - Me? - Who else would it be? Come on. - Wait for me. What's your name? Did I ask you? What's it matter? You might not talk much, but you're good for something. - Hey, but what's your name? - You're a pain. - And you like waiting tables? - Very much. I have to help my mother. - Where did you live before? - In Almazan. - Hey, boy, we won the big one! - What's up? -A peseta. Come on. Hurry! Did you see? - We've got to celebrate. - How? - Don't you see? - But what's going on? He's probably drunk. Run! They say he started drinking when the marquis died. It's probably true. You're always the same. - Are you hurt? - No. - You don't want water? - No. - This water brings good luck. - Luck? Why? - Don't you want to be rich? - Sure! You're so dumb! Where are you going? This is the street where I live. I live in there. - You're really not hurt? - No. Are you? Wait, Justa. We'll see each other in a few days. Just a bit more. No, that's enough! - You're going alone!. - You're coming with me! - It's alright now. Leave me alone! - I said... You'd go with your own mother, you drunk! - Are you coming up or what?. - Would you be quiet? - You bitch, I'll...! -But what's going on? - As if you could with a woman! You, come up. - Let go, don't handle me. - You coming inside with me! Let me give that girl what she deserves! - Let me go, I insist. - Get lost! I said you're coming up. Will you go now? Old drunk. Come on. Come closer, hand me my hat. A carriage. Look for a carriage. A carriage... please. That whore! She'll see. She'll remember me. - Whoa, horse! - Carriage... - Slut! - He's sick, huh? Let's go. - You'll pay for it. - Be careful. Come on up. Careful. - So now where? I have to take him somewhere. -I don't know. What's your name? I can't read. Don Norberto Martinez de Osorio. - Paseo de Recoletos, 15. - Martinez de Osorio... Well, hold up, young man. Just some sick man! If you ever need anything, you can find me at this number. You did me a favor. And I always pay favors back. Git up, horse. But what are you doing? Tell me!... We both have to pay for it? That's why you came all the way from the village? You're just like your father, the very same! You've done it in the end. You'll be happy. Tomorrow you'll go with your uncle Ignacio. We'll see if working does you good. You heard Ms. Casiana, you're going to sleep tonight without dinner. Damn it! Working all my life to end up chopped up by a shoemaker, and do you know why? Because no one cares anymore, and only the sloppy ones are left. So, do you like Madrid? I spend all my time shut up in the boarding house. I only left one day a week, you know? You'll see how we have fun. - Why is your brother upset? - Leandro? He's not mad, that's just how he is. It's just Milagros that gets him upset. I should have ended up with her. - All done? - Yep. Hand me the bread. Let him be, woman, he seems like a good kid. And don't start again. It's just about the food. "Where four can eat, so can five. " Who knows, maybe the good times will come back with him around. The good times! Whenever I hear that I want to die laughing! Don't pay attention. You know something? I'm glad you're here. It gives me someone to talk to. This family is too serious. Everything is like a funeral. Leandro. Wait for me, grandma. What's going on? Hey, Manolo. - Do you like them? - Yeah. They're for Milagros, Leandro's fiancee. - Should we play the lottery? - I've never played it. All the better. We're going to play a number together. Pick one you like, I'll take care of the details. In the end we'll have the last laugh at my wife. - Do you want to fix yourself up? - Yes. I told you, he's nuts. I'll wait for you below. - Good bye, dad. - Bye. - Hey, where's "El Bizco"? - I don't know. Give me a cigarette. Here, don't burn yourself. Do you have any money? But what...? Who's that? - Manolo, this is Rosa. - Hi. Bye. - Hi, Pepe. And "El Bizco"? - Over there, with grandma. - What is he doing with her? - The trouble he brings as always... - Who's that? -He's my cousin. This is Pepe. Hi, Bizco. You could have waited a bit. Leave me alone for now. - What's up? - This is my cousin Manuel. What do I care? - Hi grandma. - Say that to your mother, punk! What, you don't like it? Where are you going? She's a bit blunt, but she's worth it. You'll see. - I'm heading off. I'm going to see my mother. -Your mother? That's what you call your work? That's not work or anything, Manuel. Not work, and it doesn't pay. Better than being in the boarding house. Better in that dump than anywhere else, but taking apart shoes? Come over here. You know, you're right. In the shoe shop I don't earn much... but I get along well with my cousin, and anyway... you've got to start somewhere. I won't be there forever. It's not so bad. I'll find something else. All your life? One of these days they'll take my dresses to my house. just like I do now, and I'll give them a tip every time. What are you doing here? I've been... with Justa. Justa? And who is Justa? My girlfriend. You have a girlfriend? She'll make you bitter, just like Milagros does with me. Justa, no. Justa... What are you doing? Get up already. - What time is it? - The middle of the afternoon. - Where to? -With Bizco and the others. They're waiting. - Look, I'm hungry. Could I eat something? - I saw a bit of bread outside, but since you're not in a rush... You're always hungry. - I didn't know he was married. - Really? He's in your family. Got to be honorable. - What's wrong? - Nothing, same as always. This family. Come on, be quick! You don't know what you're saying. And what's more, she's my cousin but more like my own daughter. Can I offer you? No. Really. - Do you want some? - No. Leave me alone. Leave me alone, I said! What's wrong now? Let go. Go away! If my father were here you wouldn't be doing this! - What's wrong? -It's Leandro, it's Leandro. - There he goes, mother. Hoodlum! - What? You think we don't know...! - If he were poor as a rat, I'd marry him! - Hoodlum! - You're one to talk! Remember your husband! Go home! - Ok, it's fine now. - But what must they think? You've just got to leave Milagros. Forget about her. Let him marry his mother, or whoever he wants. Don't listen, they're all the same. Knock her with a stick and she'll follow you like a dog. Don't tell your son that, let them work it out themselves. It's all the same to me, but I have to watch him pacing around here like a nut. Come on, let's go. - You have money? - Not a cent. Can you ask your father for some? My old man? He give me a smack every time I ask. Since the shop started struggling, no one can stand him. - Give me a cigarette. - This is the last one. Some kind of trouble he's in, right? Rosa! - What? - Vidal is coming! Hey, get lost! Now! Hey, come back. Come back. Where's Rosa? - Where have you been? - Looking for you. Hi, Manuel. - Why weren't you at the bar? - I thought you were here. Come on. You, stay there! - Where are they going? - They've hooked in a country boy. They'll be at the caves. Come on over. They don't miss a trick. Well, with the money they'll earn... ...we're going to have fun today. - Do you want to play? You have some money? Money? And you... you have a girl? I think so, but she's not around here. Will you let me play? Hey, don't get mad. Vidal told me you have a girlfriend. Bring her around so we can meet her... and if she's a good girl, all the better. We'll all like to be around her. What's going on with you? That girl, and any other... we won't complain. All right, all right...! Let me go! - Bizco, leave it, Bizco. - Go! Run! - Go, hurry! - Leave him alone! I'll kill him! Let go! Here, I'll try to stop him. You eat it. Will you let me go? - Hey, where are they all going? - Them? Same as me, to the diocese. Come with me. Let's go. Come on, run. - What do they do there? - They pray, and stuff like that. - What the ladies teach them. - That's what they're waiting for? Today they give out sheets. Sheets? You're not coming in, young man? - Me? - Yes, come on. I'm asking to see if you'll sell me the sheet. The sheet? But they really hand out sheets? Sure they do. I can use the sheet for my work, get it? - And they don't care? - Why would they care! You get in line and there's nothing more to it. But you think they'll let me go in? Sure they will. Come on, I'll give you a quarter for it. - Ok, a quarter for the sheet. - Deal. Ok, but be quick. Go on, son, don't be scared. Hail Mary, full of grace, the Lord be with you. Blessed art though amongst women, and blessed is the fruit of thy womb. Hail Mary, mother of God, pray for us sinners, now and at the hour of death. Amen. Hail, Mary, full of grace, the Lord is with you. Blessed art though amongst women, and blessed is the fruit of thy womb. Where did you get so much money? I told you, from my job. Anyway, it's not that much. I'll get more... I swear it. Well, that really got to you. You were so strange the other day. And when you have a lot of money, what will you buy me? I don't know, whatever you want. - You've never swum in the river? - In the village, yes. - If you put your feet in, I'll give you a kiss. -Ok, watch me. Hey, don't go. Wait, Justa. I give up. You've never had a girlfriend? No... No... don't kiss me. No. No, please, don't kiss me. Are you upset? If you're upset, you're just a fool. Come on. A quarter for the sheet? When Bizco and I went in, we got at least two. One quarter seems fine to me, for just being there and praying a bit. Look, we've got to get to the fair. How much do you have left? Very little. Just a nickel... and some pennies. What did you spend it on, if I can ask? With Justa. Spending money on girls? You have to learn to get it from them. Want one? Are you going to the fair? I don't know. Well everything will go fine, of course. And if you think about it, you're set... With three of us it's enough. - You're sure there's no danger? - I'm sure there is. Again? Don't you see everyone's committed already? - In just a bit we'll head over there. - Ok. - And Manuel? -As we agreed. He'll wait here, on lookout. Looking out for what? - You explain it. -What do I do? I didn't tell you before, ...until we knew it would work. - Come on. - Do you know don Mario? - Don't be late. - Yes. - Well, you just have to watch out. If you see him leave, go toward his house and tell us. But you have to get there before he does. - And what are you going to do? - Don't ask, and keep your eyes open, and we'll divide everything up evenly. Listen, it's just that I... But what's wrong? Don't worry, there's no danger. Oh, listen... pay the bill. What's going on? You know that guy? - Me? I don't know. - Don't listen to him. - He just follows me everywhere. - Don't look at him. - If you want, I'll tell him something. - Oh, no. AMAZING SEE THE SKINNIEST WOMAN - Hey there, no pushing. - And Vidal? -Hi. - I don't know. Hey, what happened to your eye? -Nothing. What do you say? We could go in if you want. No, no, it's ok. I've got it. Or I should be able to. Here it is. - Two. - Here you are. It was Vidal... Your cousin. Let's go. - My treat this time. - Fine. Come on, let's go. You're leaving me for this guy? - Yeah, so what? - So what? You'll see so what. - Don't be scared, this... - Hey, you shut up. What are you doing? - Calm down! - What's going on? Let go! He killed her! Get him! He's getting away! Careful, don't get closer! He's crazy! Leandro! Clear out. Clear out please. Come on, ma'am. Come here. Come with us. - But are you really leaving? - You said it. I can't take any more. What do you want me to do, die of boredom with the old folks? Help clean the spiderwebs out of the workshop? I wasn't born for that, Manolo. Come with us, don't be a fool. What will you do in the workshop? So, have you decided? Make up your mind quick. We're leaving tonight. Tonight? After everything that's happened, I'm just confused. - But all this matters to you? - Don't talk like that. I'm just not soft like you. Do whatever you want. You are useless. Last night when you were looking out for us you left us with our asses hanging out. We're lucky nothing happened. You could have ruined us! - Don't yell, Vidal. - But how could I have warned you? What's done is done. But we could have gone to jail. Don't go, Manuel. - Where are you going? - Now you're going to feel bad for him? So what will you do? I don't know. I don't know what to think. I can't go back with my uncle... What would you do? Tell me, what would you do? You have to decide for yourself. I'm not in your place, Manolo. Justa! It's my father. I have to go. What you have to do is find a job. And forget about your cousin. Wait. Tell me when I can see you again. I don't know. I have to go, you heard. We'll see each other some other time. What do you want? Good evening, sir. You gave me this card. Don't you remember? You said if I ever needed anything, ...that I should come see you... - Of course, I remember. Have a seat. What can I do for you? I need work. Come here. Let's see, what do you know how to do? Well, I've been... in... in a boarding house... taking messages and waiting tables. And then in a cobblers workshop. Ok. You'll go to this address. Understand? - Do I wait for you below? - Fine. Ask for don Enrique. - Ok, young man. Good luck. - Thank you. Thank you very much, sir. Good bye. Hey, you... Come here. Come on, hurry up. Act lively, or I'll shove you in the oven like a bread roll. Put this on, Berber. Why do you always call me Berber? Because you are a Berber. And where are you from? From Almazan. And what did you think Madrid was? The same thing happened to me as happened to you. I'm just another Berber. You hear me? We're all Berbers. What a recommendation. He must not be an important gentleman. It's not his fault, the problem is me. I had to escape. I've brought you something. What is it? I made it. It's to eat. Have some. - Its so pretty. - It's very good, it's sweet. - It has anise. Do you like it? - I do. Well, I have to go. It's late... and I have to heat up the oven. Could we see each other on Thursday? I don't know. Stop by the shop ahead of time. Manolo. Manolo. Get up, someone's asking for you out there. - Who is it? - I don't know. Go out and see. Come on. - Are you Manuel, Petra's son? - Yes. Your mother is sick. She asked for you. - Can I go? - Go on. She's dead. - Do you want a drink? - No, thank you. Here. This is what she had saved up. Seven pesetas. It's not much... but now they're yours. I don't want you to go hungry. Stop by every once in a while, whenever you need. - Here. - No, put it away. It was your mother's. Keep it. If you need anything, let me know. - Do you want a glass of anise? - No. Well, you finally showed up. I heard about the death of your poor mother from Leandra. I'm sorry. Well, what can I do for you? Do you know if there's any work for me in anything? - What happened? - Nothing. - I don't know... -And tomorrow...! ...you came at a very bad time. ... this has to be arranged right away. - Wait. - We can't keep on like this. - It wasn't like that. -Yeah, just words. Words, always words. This has to be fixed. Yeah, great excuses, but it won't help. - It's that with this... - But they're more involved than you. Now take this. Correct it yourself. Here are the instructions. Come back in a few days and we'll see. There's no rush. People are a bit worked up. - I might have some work from you in a few days. -For me? - Hey, does anyone live here? - They closed it a bit ago. There were scandals. - Are you coming with me? - No, it's getting late. Bye, dear. It's been so long. What are you doing here? Come on, come with me. Have a drink with us. Sit down. So you're Manuel. Justa told me a lot about you. - Can't you stay for a while? - No, no, I'm in a hurry. I was in the area... and I wanted to see how you were. You're skinnier. Maybe... What are you doing now? Well... I've just started... I'm working in a print shop. - Ok, I need to go. - If you need to. - Pleased to meet you. - Bye, kid. - Come back some time, Manuel. - Oh... sure. Bye. Does Ignacio's son Vidal still come by here? It's been a long time since he's been here. - And Bizco? - If I see him I'll string him up. Ok, you've had enough! Clear out, outside! Want one? Did you sleep here? Where do you live? - Nowhere. - Just like me. Let me have one. Thanks. - It's cold. - I'm fine. - What's your name? - They call me Exposito. - Why do they call you that? - Because I don't have parents. And you... ...you've never had a home? - Me? No. Never, never? You have a...? - Where do you sleep? - Wherever I can. - And is there water around here? - Here... there's none. - And what do you eat? - Whatever I can get. But... but how can you live like this? - How do you manage? - I do what I can. I pick up butts, sell sand. When I don't earn anything, I go to the barracks. - What for? - To get a meal. A meal? And where is the barracks? - You want to go too? - Yeah. It's allowed, right? Well, let's get going. It might get late. It's a ways away. First we'll go to the bend to see if we can fish for something. - Hey... and where do I eat with? - That's a good point. Maybe someone who finishes up will let you borrow their plate. Can I eat with you? Sit down if you want. Grandma, could you lend me your pail? I'll give it back soon. If you give me half your food, I will. Have mine if you want. Ingrate! You know the cave of the cripple? The one near San Blas hill? We're going there to see if "La rubia" y "La chata" are there. Who are they? - You'll like them. - I think I know them. - You? - Yes, me. Let's go. I want to meet them. - What's going on? - They wanted to see you. - It's you. What do you want? - To introduce you to these friends. I already know them. - My own father can't come in here broke! - What, are you going to pay? - She's a friend. - You can come in. - I don't know you. - Come in. - I said no! - Shut up, cripple! - Hey, the cops are coming! - Come on, hurry! Run, everybody run! They'll catch us! Hey... Vidal! - Isn't this your cousin? - What does that idiot want? You're not going? Manolo! - What are you doing here? - Sit down. Have a glass. Things don't seem to be going well for you. And for you guys are they going better? He'll tell you. We've got a good business. If you want to join up... Well what do you think? For me what's done is done. Agreed? Agreed. Sure. Here, have a drink. - Who is this guy? - You'll see, we'll have a good time. - Can I sit down? - Sure, have a seat. Don't get up. And... What if I can't hack it? Why wouldn't you be able to? Anyone in the world could. It's just that not everyone is given what they need. No. I don't like Bizco. You'll get used to him. He seems worse than he is. I don't trust him. I just don't like him. Don't pay attention to him. - Are we close? - We'll be there soon. - I can't go any further. - Come on, it's just a bit more. You know what a cushion is. - Who is that girl from the lunch counter? - You like her? You haven't learned anything, have you? Now tell me what you've been up to all this time. Come on. And what have you all been doing? Have you been working? Working? No chance. We've had some really hard times... but now, things will be better. Here it is. That's the face of working people. - Hi, Vidal. - Hi. You think the three of us will get along? Here it is. Come in, and don't say more dumb things. - What's wrong? - Nothing. - And Bizco? - He's there. Ask him what we're doing. Bizco... Vidal asks why we're waiting. Let's go. Vidal. Vidal, there it is. - Tonight. - Some advice, in case they catch us... we don't have to run. We can stay inside, quiet. Why? Get caught inside, it's robbery in progress. Six months, and easy ones, but if they catch you fleeing, then it's a full-scale robbery, and you won't be out for a long time. I've learned the hard way. - Well, I'm escaping if I can. - You'd be making a mistake. What do you care? That's my business. See you tomorrow. But... Why did you come here? Wait. It's been so long. Come here. - Why do you want to see me? - What do you think? Hush. Who was that guy? You met him. - We're going to get married. - I'd like to see him. He doesn't love you. He'd only take advantage of you. Well, aren't you jealous. Me? Manuel... I have to do it. You don't understand. But it's you I love. Everything that... he can give you, I can give you too, you'll see. You? Yes, me. You haven't changed, you're the same as always. Justa, Justa. What are you doing? Where are you going? - Run, go! It's my father. - Bye. What are you doing here? Come inside. Careful with the glass. Break it with a stone. What's wrong? Be quick. Here. Quiet! I'll head down there. This is all you found? Come on, man, sit down. - We have 10 reales, minus the bottle. - You want a glass of wine? Between three... 80 cents a piece. And this coin, heads or tails? Ok? - Where are you going? - Let him be. I already told you that he wouldn't change. Manolo! Hey, Manolo, wait up! - Remember about tomorrow. -Tomorrow? - It won't be like at the fair. - Wait, where are you going? - I'm tired, I'm going to sleep. - Tell Rosa that we won't be long, she should wait for me. -Fine. What is it? You're not working today either? - A cigarette? - I don't have one. You don't have anything else to do, huh? Here. Bye. - Give me a little, son. - But why do you chase them out? What? Nothing, nothing. - Well, are you going or not? - We're going, now. - Something's up with you. - With me? Why? You should know. You've been going around in circles for an hour without talking. Why didn't you go with them today? Tell me why. No reason. What do you care? I'm telling you that it does matter to me. If you don't want to talk, then don't. I know... why you didn't go with them. Why's that? And Vidal? He won't find out, you'll see. And if he does find out, then what? Doesn't he send you out every night for the same thing? That's the only thing I know for sure. The only thing! Next time I'll be luckier. No... I'm going. Why don't you come with me? Rosa! Is Manolo in there? Rosa! Go, Manuel. Hurry. Tell that jackass to come out! Manuel... We have to run. it's a shoddy job, but we have to do it quick, ...all three of us. - You know I'm not good at this. Just stay on your feet, ok? Leave him alone for once. Let Rosa come out, she has more guts than him. Do whatever you want, I'm not going. - But where are you going? - "I'm not going". I already knew that. I told you, I warned you, and you know why he's not coming? Because he's a chicken! Go on, say it yourself, chicken. Should I remind you of your mother? You, asshole. Be careful. Say it to me again, come on. You asked for it. - No, Vidal, don't do it. - Wait, I want to see if he's a man. No, Vidal, no. Bizco, leave him alone. Leave him alone! No, you're going to kill him! Manuel, go, run! You shut up! Don't get involved in this! I'll beat him to death! Let go of the knife. Leave me be! Throw the knife away. Run, quick! - The cops are coming! - Go Manuel, run! - You come here. - Hide! - Come here! - Let me go! Let me go! THE END
