Everyone needs a plan. That's what my mom told me as she was carrying me north across the border. Everyone needs a plan. I'm 22 years old and still undocumented. Illegal. I don't care what you call it, really. They're all just other words for afraid. I grew up knowing that any one of us, my mom, my dad, my sisters, could be basically kidnapped by the government. My mother and my brother were just taken by immigration. My dad was detained in front of me on my way to school. Most immigrants pass through a kind of purgatory on their way out of the country. A detention center. Inside, there's been cases of abuse and even mysterious death. Well, tonight, I have one question. How can I get in? Our inside man was Claudio Rojas. He just didn't know it yet. Yeah? - Yes. - Okay. Claudio Rojas! Papa? We have an order for your deportation. 19108. 1950YN. In cases like your father's there's really nothing that can be done. We can help speed up his deportation. Okay, thanks. My name is Marco Saavedra. I am undocumented and unafraid. I am originally from Oaxaca, Mexico. I crossed the border at the age of three through the Sonoran Desert. Went to school in Massachusetts. I believe that none of us are free as long as one family is suffering deportation or separation. Everyone needs a plan. For two years I've been working with a group. We're all young illegals. Our mission? Stop the deportations. It was self defense. Our strategy? Organize, escalate, shut something down. We came outta the shadows and stopped a few deportations. Our own. The new plan? Get into the Broward Detention Center and get people out. What was the number again? Come on Marco, 207. All right. See you guys soon, I hope. Good luck. The Border Patrol. My own personal Death Star. Customs and Border Protection is twice the size of the FBI. The largest law enforcement agency the world has ever known. What can I do for ya? Hi. I'm looking for my cousin. Your cousin, why? We may think he, he's detained by the Border Patrol. Is he an illegal alien? Does he have papers to be here? No, he don't have papers. Did he come here, to America illegally? We all came together. Do you have papers to be here legally? No. You know I have to arrest you. Oh. Keep your hands behind your back. Come on, turn around, now. Put your hands behind your back. I've determined you're in this country illegally. You're gonna be transported to a detention facility and most likely deported given your previous arrest. Any questions? No. They called Broward a model detention center. Detainees with no criminal record, minimum security, TVs in every room. I kept telling myself it was a Florida motel where I couldn't check out. A year ago I was reading Kafka. Now I was living it. Because none of the men in here committed crimes, they weren't being legally punished. And so they don't get a right to a trial before getting locked up. They don't get a court appointed lawyer. They don't even get a sentence. They just get warehoused. I'm with the National Immigrant Youth Alliance. Now who's on the mess hall for turn over? Rojas. Call from an inmate at Broward Transitional Center. This call is subject to recording and monitoring. Mohammad, did you know they have solitary in here? Sure. You did? And you didn't tell me this? Why, are you scared? No, I'm not scared. Of course not. I just didn't know. Just don't get sent there. And also, we have somebody comin' by later, they're gonna bring you some paperwork. Gotta go my love, Maria. Okay, okay, bye. Okay, it's going. Should I speak up louder or is that fine? - Just so I know I'm not... - That's good. Okay. I hate videos. Let's go. Hi everybody, my name's Mohammad. I am undocumented. My parents immigrated here from Iran when I was just three years old. If you were deported where would you be deported to? If I was deported I would be deported to Iran, and because I'm gay that's probably not the best place to go. Please support the youth, support education, pass the DREAM Act. The federal bill would give undocumented immigrants brought to the U.S. as children a pathway to permanent citizenship. One day my mom just learned about the DREAM Act and what she told me was, "Don't ever search for it "'cause the government will find us somehow." And so the first thing I did is I Googled the DREAM Act. From there I sorta got connected with other undocumented youth. Essentially what we're gonna do from now is the training is still gonna happen. It's gonna start as soon as we kick everybody else out. We're just gonna do the legal part for the folks that are doing the action, so we'll talk about that. We're here ask Senator McCain to cosponsor the DREAM Act. So we're here to ask him to cosponsor the bill right now. Five protestors, reportedly all illegal immigrants are refusing to leave. Marking one of the first known instances activists have risked deportation. DREAM Act now! DREAM Act now! DREAM Act now! DREAM Act now! How do you wish to plead, Sir? Not guilty. The one thing that every undocumented kid is told is if you see a police officer run and hide because you could get turned over to immigration. What we learned is that to actually have power as an immigrant, you have to do the exact opposite. Whenever we got arrested publicly, ICE was nowhere to be found. - Let's go, let's go. - Let's go, turn around. Let's go. So once we sort of had the safety of knowing we could not be deported, we sort of had infinite possibilities. Okay. Hey, I'm working with a group and we're tryin' to get people outta here. I was wondering if I could give you their number? Wait, get people out? How? Well, how'd you end up in here? So stupid, man. I don't have a driver's license, so I was riding my bike on the sidewalk and I get stopped by the cops. They hand me over to ICE. But the flip side is this. As quick as they sweep you up they can release you. All it takes is someone from ICE, from the President on down to make that call. That's what our group does. We put pressure on those people. Let me see your book. Call this number. Tell 'em Marco told you to call. Copy that, comin' now. I want that cleaned up by lunch. Sure thing, boss. You got a minute? Sure. From India? Sri Lanka. How long you been in here? Two years. Hey, my friend, my friend. Oh. He's resisting. Hey, do not resist. Up against the wall. Grab the ankles, damn it. Do not resist! Hi. Do you know a guy named Marco? He said I should call you, and to tell you I'm a DREAMER at Broward. We basically did this whole intake when people called us. We got their name, their alien number, how they got detained, their history. Ismael, what's his story, Viri? Ismael came by himself to the U.S. at the age of 12 and he's from Guatemala and he has been here since and he's 18 years old now. Every deportation can be stopped. The government has the power to grant discretion for anybody not to be deported. Yeah, so it's the National ICE in D.C. that can do something. The perfect example is Obama's uncle who's undocumented. He had a DUI. His deportation was stopped. Once it was like okay, this case is solid, we started an online petition. Every time somebody would sign the petition, there was an automatic email that was generated that was sent to the personal email of someone that worked at Immigration. We had probably 4,000 signatures in just the period of like, 12 hours. His name is Ismael. 5360, 5360. Ismael, I got a question for you, man. What's your room number inside? 264? Obama was saying, "We're not jailing people "unless they are criminals." Hey, question for you. Do you have a GED or high school diploma? At this point there was already the online petition calling for his release, but we needed more. We reached out to Senator Nelson and Ted Deutch who's a representative because his district is the Broward Detention Center. The purpose of petitions was really to annoy the hell out of the offices. Some offices clearly were overwhelmed by the calls that came in. It's because of the National Immigrant Youth Alliance that we were first made aware of what was happening at this facility. That's why we got involved. Okay, I'm gonna hand you back to Bryan but I'm all good at my end. Ismael Garcia? Ismael Garcia? Are you Ismael? Come with me to processing, let's go. I ain't got all day. Yes, hi. I'm calling to find out the status of a case. Okay. What is his name? Ismael. I-S-M-A-E-L. Okay, he has been released? Yes. Okay, okay. That's what I wanted to know. Thank you. - You're welcome. - Okay, buh bye. Buh bye. Ismael got released. DREAMER released, DREAMER released, - DREAMER released! - Ismael got released. Here you go. Okay. So I call my dad and my dad comes in, and as soon as he came in, like Border Patrol showed up. So, they were like, "Okay, we have to take you in." I was there for three months with my dad. But my dad came out with a different deal. He came out with the condition of leaving the country after three months. Oh, Marco. Thank you. Call the group that freed Ismael. Call this number with your case, they're waiting for your call. Hey, this message - is for Viridiana... - Hold on. - Hello, hello? - Hi, I'm calling on behalf of my husband who is at BTC Detention Center. Calls were coming in from sunrise to sundown everyday. - My brother is in ICE. - My husband. - My cousin. - He's in the Broward County Detention Center. And I was wanting to see... The 600 man warehoused in here all had different cases. Ismael was easy. Claudio will be hard. To get him out was gonna take a big campaign. Time, people, planning. Whether or not he got to stay in the country was a question of who will move faster? Us or them? The GEO Group has a contract to run this facility on behalf of Homeland Security. The job program allows detainees to get involved and be productive. Look at your credentials. Speak English, Spanish. Got some computer skills. With that you're lookin' at library and or nurse station. That was my first legitimate job interview, and my first legal job in this country. Working for the GEO Group earning a dollar a day. Take the aspirin. It should help control the swelling. Come on, please. What do you want? Oh, the Job Office sent me. Oh, yeah. First mission, run this to the station on the east wing. Thank you. Nurse told me to take these to the east wing. Since the company only paid a dollar a day, they had to offer something else as compensation. Visitors. If you agreed to work, you get more visitors. That's why most men worked in here. That's why I took a job, too. - Get through, come back. - Yeah. I didn't even know there was a woman side to the detention center until Marco turns himself in and he gets in and he's like, "Yeah, there's a woman's side." And then Mo is like, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding. This little light bulb went on and he's like, "Hey Viri." And I'm like, "Yeah, I know. "I know what you're gonna say." But like Ricardo could - be here and Ricardo the east. - Okay, guys let's go eat. Viri, are you ready to get detained? So how did you meet each other 'cause you all come from different state? We all did organizing around legislation, and so we all kind of talked to each other on the phone for awhile, - those sorts - Oh, wow. - of things and then... - Have you heard of it? - The DREAM Act? - No. Oh. Do you know there's an immigration detention center in Broward? So they have 600 men and 100 women and they're in there for like eight months. Six, seven months. So she's gonna go there to find a story so that we can work on the cases. She's the bait. She's our bait, yeah. There you go. I think that's the best analysis of what's going on here. I'm gonna have my birthday in detention. I mean, I had a dress on and like, makeup, my hair was done. I called my mom and my dad and I said, "This is what I'm about to do." They were scared for their daughter. I remember me telling them, "Well, the reality is that these people could be you." She's gonna walk to the Border Patrol. You remember the Border Patrol building, right? - Yeah. - The one on the left. - Yeah. - The parking lot was empty. Yeah. Go in. I'm looking for my friend, Marco. Left here. The idea for Viridiana to infiltrate was to escalate. Are you like, lost? Me no papers. Okay, how did you get here? Who dropped you off? Can one of you guys get out here? Wrong place. Sorry. Damn it, why did she dress so fancy? They saw the Mustang? They asked if someone dropped her off and that he wanted to know the truth, what's going on. Okay, tell her not to walk here. Tell her to keep walking. Just keep walking, tell her... Just keep walking. She came in the car, slammed the door. Her face was red, just really upset. He's an asshole. It wasn't just enough to go turn myself in. I needed to prepare to actually play this role. All visitors be advised, all bags and large personal belongings will be searched. Berlinger here to see Saavedra. Radam, short for Radical Adam. He was a U.S. citizen, the only one in our group. - ID. - Since most of the guys in here have undocumented families, those families can't come visit. My parents couldn't visit me. Go in. Mo and Viri couldn't visit me. But Radical Adam could. Hi. Hey. - I'm Radam. - Yeah, I know. Mo told me. You doin' okay? A lot better than most of these guys in here. I miss my mom's cooking. She has a restaurant, right? Yeah, Mexican food in New York. I keep tellin' her to call it The Five Burros but... Okay, well let's do this. There's a senator who's interested in learning more about Claudio's case. There's not much time. I'll come back in an hour to pick his up. - Okay. - Now there are waivers in there for the other urgent cases, too. Raoul Contralis, Gustafo Galindo, Pablo Oriano. Okay, I'll try to get 'em all done. Thanks. Okay, these are basically permission slips to waive your right to privacy. Spread 'em. Dispatch. Everything's in there. Beni didn't sign. I'm working on getting you some money for your commissary, you can buy some better food. With the privacy waivers out, the team on the outside could build powerful campaigns to press for the detainees to be freed. Oh, fuck this shit. Don't tell me the call dropped. My call dropped, too. - Were you the same? - Yeah. Beni had been in the U.S. for 10 years trying to get asylum. He had been tortured back in his home country. I understand why he didn't wanna sign the waiver. He didn't like government documents. But his asylum request was denied, and now he was in limbo. Beni? Call from an inmate at Broward Transitional Center. Mohammad, they're deporting Beni. His flight leaves tonight. Yeah, yeah, I know. He just called his wife. Hey, can you please, please, please try and find out what time his flight is? Hey Claudio? Okay, but what do I tell him? So, tell him to try and refuse to board. Like, do the same strategy as Andy that he did, which was he told the pilot that he was afraid his life was in danger. He refused to board. Tell him to refuse to put on his seatbelt and those sorts of things. I mean, ICE can't drug him right there on the spot if they want to, but can you please, please, please try and find out what time his flight is? Okay, okay, I'll try. And call me back right away. I'll do it. 'Cause what he told his wife is that he's gonna get moved at 11. What are you lookin' at, man? Let's go. - Hey, Anita? - Hey, Mo? Yes. Hey, so we had somebody just call the deportation officer. Uh huh. And they said that he refused to board so they're bringing him back to Broward. Oh my God! And he's for sure? Yeah, so that's what the deportation officer said that he's on his way back to Broward because he refused to board. Oh my God. Let's see if we can use the urgency right now and get them to release him. Okay, perfect, Mo. Thank you very much. No problem. I'll talk to you soon, buh bye. Bye. Aw, she's so happy. Aw. She's so happy. That's too much. I can't handle it. She's so happy. I can't handle it hearing somebody cry. And that's just because he's coming back to Broward. - I know. - We need to get him out - I know. - right away. There was a man that reached out to us. His wife was detained, Maria. We said to him there's a girl from our team who's gonna turn herself in. Oh, this is perfect. It's a complete different look. This is how you get detained. In order to get Viridiana inside we had to sort of become the stereotypes that we advocated against. Really? This is not believable. Mister, I'm here to turn myself in. - No, too modest. - Too formal. Too DREAMER. Too DREAMER. - I'm here to... - It's gotta be Spanish. I here turn self in. You've been taking too many calls. I can almost compare it to a theater play. Mo being the director and Marco and I being actors. - All right. - You're very good when you're whining as well. Like, when you made it sound very whiny. No, no, like very whiny - in terms of like... - No, I know. - That's what I'm tryin' to... - 'Cause then more of your sadness came out in it, and that's really good 'cause it's natural desperation. So make it sound desperate. I'm going up there to see if they'll let me in. Yeah and when you go up there, be like I wanna go to Border Patrol, I wanna go to Border Patrol. And he's like, wait, why are you coming? You wanna smoke before you go? No, I don't wanna smoke before I go. Do you want a shot of Patron? No, I don't want a shot of Patron. - You good? - Good luck, Viri. Yeah, I'm gonna cry - so that I do it - Perfect, perfect. - because if not I'm gonna... - Be emotional. - Damn it. - Did you hang up? She hung up. Should I call her again? No. Hello? - Hello? - Hi. Oh hi. Hi, how are you? Who am I speaking with? Santiago. - Don't say a last name. - I'm sorry? Santiago. Don't say a last name. Okay, hi Santiago. My name is Santiago, too. Oh. So I like that name. Okay. Check this out. Okay. Do you speak Spanish or English? Which one's better - for you 'cause I... - English. English. I prefer English. Okay. All right. Hey, is your mother there? My mother? Yes. Yeah, can I talk to your mother? It makes it easier for me. She doesn't speak English. Yeah, no, I'll speak Spanish to your mother. She says that she doesn't feel comfortable speakin' on the phone. Okay. He bought it. Line it up! Let's go! Line it up! Let's go. Viri, I have a question for you. Yeah? At what point did you stop talking in only Spanish? When I finally made it to BTC. Okay, okay. Cool. Hey, and you saw Marco? I saw him, yeah. Aw, cute. Just careful not to attract too much attention. Yeah, I'm not. I'm just being really quiet. - Okay. - Because people are kind of like not really trusting. - Yeah. - There's word that there might be some infiltrators or people who get along with the officers. Found our guy, boss. So you're back. Who do you work for? I'm not working for anyone. Are you a lawyer? No. I'm visiting a detainee. I made an appointment. I don't know what you're up to, but from now on things are gonna be very different. Get him out. The facility came up with a new policy that said, "Oh, you're not allowed to bring documents "in if you're just a visitor." Kind of freaking out because without the privacy waiver, we can't get people out in a day or two, we can't get members of Congress moving because they all need this permission slip. Okay. Okay. Samuel had just seen his name on the board. In 48 hours he's gonna be loaded up on a plane and sent back to Honduras. Here he had an American wife and four citizen children. Back there gangs had killed his two brothers. Does he have a criminal record? Has he ever been arrested besides this? According to ICE policy your husband's not supposed to be in there at all. And he is. So would you be willing to make your case public? Are you okay with that? These are my four kids. My husband was stopped by the police on the way to work. He was arrested for havin' an expired license. At this moment he could be deported, at any moment, and my kids are gonna be without a father. - Another break? - No, Sir. - Get up! - It's my first break. Every time I turn around you're sitting down. No, that's not true. Please, boss, it's not true. Get to work. Hey, Ashan, are you okay? What was that all about? Who cares? The guy's an ass. Yeah, he's an asshole. All right, man. Hey? Are you still giving out that number? My friends called it. When? A week ago. What'd they say? I'm not sure. I think Mohammad is trying to help him. God help me. Samuel had been taken to processing. Time was running out. We had to get his paperwork out, now. Hey Ashan. Hey. Hey, I was wondering, and it's okay if you don't want to, but would you be able to do something? It's not for me, it's for... For Mohammad? Samuel's asylum application, 13 privacy waivers and a letter to mom promising I'll come back to help with the restaurant if I ever get outta here. All right, here we go. Step out, watch your step. Single file. Single file, watch your step. Come on. Yes, I have somebody that's being deported in a couple hours and I was told to call headquarters and speak to somebody who's on call. It's very urgent. We filed an emergency stay of removal and there hasn't been a decision and we haven't heard anything but the family member contacted us and said they're being deported at five in the morning. Samuel Rosales. Come with me. Come with me. Beni, you gotta help us out, buddy. We got a job to do. Miss Moran, I'm here with Beni. No. Hello? We just need a minute to discuss a few things with him. Clear the yard. You're coming with us, asshole. - No, no, no, no! - We're putting you on a plane. No, no! God damn it, you're comin'. No, no, no, no. I had my birthday in there. So I remember talking to Mo and saying like, "I don't know how much longer "I'm gonna be able to stay here." Hey, Neema, you want my biscuit? Ever since I did time at McDonald's I stay away from them. I was quiet back then. My mom used to say , which means like, I never broke a plate, but it really means like, I was careful, always followed the rules. You? Well, I always followed the rules, big time. Graduated top of my class. And then I learned that I couldn't go to college, so I had to learn how to make biscuits. I shoulda just partied by ass off in high school. What you sayin'? If the group does it then I'll do it, too. If we do it as a group then we can get a lot of media attention. Listen to Mr. TV now. No, but listen. What is the point if no one's watching? 30 days? He's fasting right now for like, this is, what? 16 days maybe, already. Tomorrow will be like 17. So, that's another thing that concerns me, 'cause I don't know how he is. Like, he talks on the phone and he said that he's fine but, like I don't see him, I don't see his face, I don't see his expressions and stuff, so, it worries me a lot. - Claudio? - Hey. The plan was that Mo would go to the media, go public with the campaign, put national pressure on ICE. But no one was taking the story. What? - Hey look. - What? Neema. It is true? Everyone was like. And oh my,. Viri? Yeah? If you go public, will my name be on the news? We don't have to use your name. - It could just be... - No. I want my husband to see. Her name is Neema, she's from Congo. Her husband was beating her and she finally went to the cops to turn him in. Like, she thought she was doing the right thing and they detained her. She's been here for almost three years and she hasn't been able to see her son the whole time. Yeah, three years. Mr. TV man. You saw it? We want to join the fast. He said we're gonna bring down the wall. - Line up, please. - Viridiana Martinez, welcome to "Democracy Now!" Why were you willing to be arrested and deported to find out what was happening inside this jail? I have found several stories of women who have been held for over a year. We want the immediate release of all low priority cases here at Broward. What now? We stop eating with the men. Stop eating? The men are already doing it. Food sucks anyway, right? Let's do it. This is months before the election. Elaine where have the candidates been focusing in Florida lately? It's pretty evenly split between republicans and democrats. However, there is also a large group of Hispanic voters. Obama needs the Latino vote. He's going after the Latino vote. We have sort of a national effort with the petition and everything online trying to push for these deportations to be stopped. Claudio Rojas, he's an Argentinian father whose been in there since February, and he's actually the reason why we even infiltrated this detention center. If Obama was serious about all of this, he could just give us an executive order, very simple, and that's something that is an actual law that has to be followed with actual rules and actual accountability. Hey, so this group you're workin' with, who are they? The National Immigrant Youth Alliance. What exactly do they want? What do they want? Freedom. Wait. Wait, hold on, hold on. Handle this fool. Hey. Hey, are you okay? - What... - Quiet. Warden? They're here. Sit. We've reviewed your cases. You're both here illegally. You both have prior arrests. But today I got some good news. You both qualified for immediate release. Release? Yeah, immediately. Just like that? Oh, we'll give you a few minutes to pull your belongings together. What changed about our case? Look, all I need is the name and address of the person that's comin' to pick ya up. We need to make a phone call. You got that name for me? Actually several. We're not leavin' until these men get released. What did you say? You gotta be kidding me. These women deserve to be released just as much as I do. On my list, Claudio Rojas. He has a family here. Maria Soledad is a political refugee from Venezuela. Are you really planning to send her home to be killed? Would you please just give me the name and address of the person comin' to pick you up? Stop right there. We came to pick up Viridiana. Just stay right here. They'll bring her out. Why can't we just come pick her up? - 'Cause I said no. - 51. 10/4. It's about, it's 15 people. I'm not leaving. We're not leaving. We have a situation in the courtyard. We need boots on the ground. The Broward County Sheriff's Office has been called. In 10 minutes you can walk out or be hauled out. Everyone needs a plan, but sometimes you have to improvise. Stand back, stand back. Undocumented, unafraid. Undocumented, unafraid. Undocumented, unafraid. Now you're not scared? Please leave - our property now. - My name is Viridiana. That's nice. I don't work for you. - Viridiana, Viridiana? - Please go. What is the fear? I don't understand what the fear is? Bye, Viridiana. - But I wanna know... - Another two more weeks. You want me to leave but where are the other people that need to be out here that should not be held inside, and yet they still are and they're waiting for answers and nobody will give us answers. Marco? Marco? Marco, woo! Hey. Oh, good to see you out. - Hey, how you doin'? - You got a new shirt. Yeah. How are you? - That sounds good. - Aw, they're gonna get out. - Yeah. - You mom is coming... In every family I have been able to see my own family and that's sacred. Family is sacred. What would I want someone to do for my family? Hurry up. Gather your belongings. I can pick you up! I'm picking my wife up! It's hard to be in there to like, - just trust whoever you know. - Yeah. Like there's a lot at stake. Hey, how are you? - Good, good. - How are you? Good, good, how are you? - Oh man. - Long drive? Oh man, you have no idea. You have no idea. - Okay. - What the hell? Oh my God. ♪ Happy birthday to you ♪ Oh, you guys! ♪ Happy birthday to you ♪ ♪ Happy birthday dear Viridiana ♪ ♪ Happy birthday to you ♪ Infiltrating! Infiltrating! 2012! Thank you so much. We have to put you in isolation for your own safety. You lost 12 pounds in the last 10 days and we're worried about your health. Okay. Bye. 360 people didn't go to breakfast, but they're saying that it's even smaller now. The people that are lining up for meals. Claudio told me that he had already lost his family. What else does he have to lose? So, I'm choosing to go back in jail again as a symbol knowing that I will see my mother Natalia, my father Antonio, my sister Yahida and Carolina. And believing that that same organizing will allow Claudio to see Emiliano and his wife and son again. The fact that you're all here, they're gonna see that on the TV and they're gonna be able to wake up tomorrow and have more hope than they did today. So every time you chant, you chant loud. Undocumented! Unafraid! Undocumented! Unafraid! Undocumented! Unafraid! Undocumented! Unafraid! Undocumented! Unafraid! These folks don't have drivers license. They can't visit their families in there. They're tried everything else. They're tried the senator, they've tried everything and unfortunately it feels like they've read some civil rights books and I don't know. Undocumented! Unafraid! Undocumented! Unafraid! Undocumented! Unafraid! Undocumented! Unafraid! Undocumented! Unafraid! Undocumented! Unafraid! Undocumented, unafraid. Undocumented, unafraid. Undocumented, unafraid. Undocumented, unafraid. Undocumented, unafraid! Going into Broward we kinda jokingly said that we were just gonna bring it to a halt. It was an out of control facility just by the simple fact that people were empowered. They're not trained to deal with people who hold their heads up. In my perfect world, I wouldn't be a part of it. I would've been able to go to college and I would've been living my life. Currently, I work at my family's restaurant. I'm involved in the Immigrant Rights Movement. I don't know how I think about the decision now but I definitely have more hesitancy now than I did back then. Let's take a look at the electoral college map right now. With that win in Wisconsin, look at how close he is. Right now he has 257 electoral votes. He needs 13 more. 270 to be elected President of the United States. He is getting incredibly, incredibly close. Now people will believe the worst. My husband is currently in an immigration jail. I have three kids that depend on him. Outrage turning into frustration and tears as a mom is deported. Her family members say she was trying to do the right thing. Checking in with ICE is required.
