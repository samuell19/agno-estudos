Woahaha! Hey! Woah! L-l-l-look out! H-h-here I come! Ready or not! Haha! Tadaa! Hmm, may I introduce myself, I am Seymour S. Sassafrass &amp; company. This is the Seymour S. Sassafrass, and this is the company! I am a peddler by trade, by trade and by golly, by golly, by golly, I deal in magic and moonbeams and pretty, pretty colors. Ohhhh, yes! I can sell you the most perfect pink, or the most blissful blue, or a simply euphoric yellow. Heheh! That, of course, is why I'm here in April Valley, delivering all these colors to Peter Cottontail, so he can paint his Easter eggs, you know. What? You say you've never been to April Valley before? Well, that's okay. I'll show you around. This way, please. Now you see? April Valley's where all the Easter bunnies live and work. Oh, yes. Ah! April Valley's finest candy carvers. Meet Milk- chocolate Angelo, and Leonardo de Bittersweet, hehe. And over there is the famous Easter bunny bonnet founder. Now, of course, it's all very nice here, thanks to Peter Cottontail. Hmm? You've never heard of Peter Cottontail? Great chattering chip chicks! They've never heard of Peter Cottontail! (echoing) They've never heard of Peter Cottontail?! Why, he's the number-one Chief Easter bunny around here, see? Y-you-- you mean you never heard how he almost lost the job? (gasp) Oh my, you actually mean you never heard how a terrible, wicked nasty rabbit named Irontail almost became the Easter bunny? (evil laughing) Montrezaur! Montrezaur! Away! Away-! Here, if you peek into this magic egg, you'll see the whole story just as it happened. Peter was just a young whippersnapper, sort of a junior Easter bunny. ♪ Here comes Peter Cottontail ♪ ♪ Hoppin' down the bunny trail ♪ ♪ Hippity, hoppity, Easter's on its way ♪ ♪ Bringin' every girl and boy ♪ ♪ Baskets full of Easter joy ♪ ♪ Things to make your Easter bright and gay ♪ Well, it all began one bright and sunny springtime right here in April Valley. The former Chief Easter bunny, Colonel Wellington B. Bunny, --oh, he was a fine old gent-- was getting on in years, and he figured it was just about time for him to retire. Of course, it was his sworn duty to appoint a worthy successor. [Colonel] No, it's out of the question... that one could, hmm.. Wait! Peter Cottontail-- Just a moment, now here's a likely candidate. Er, I really don't think Cottontail's your man, sir. I mean, he is boastful, he has no sense of responsibility, and sometimes, sometimes he fibs! - Oh, well I know he's not perfect, but he's got real spunk and ingenuity. Reminds me of me when I was his age. But-- I never dreamed I'd get to be Chief Easter bunny! Peter, you're telling a fib! Every time you tell a fib, your left ear droops! Oh, heheh, well I guess I did think about the job once or twice. Uh, lots of times. Peter, good heavens, Peter, my boy, you've got to shape up and reform if you want to be Chief Easter bunny. ♪ There are tulips that need tending ♪ ♪ And baskets that need mending ♪ ♪ The jellybeans are piling up in heaps ♪ ♪ There are eggs that need collecting ♪ ♪ And hens who are expecting ♪ ♪ In Spring, the Easter bunny never sleeps ♪ ♪ There are bonnets that need sewing ♪ ♪ And gardens that need hoeing ♪ ♪ Some chocolate chicks have broken out in peeps! ♪ ♪ There are colors that are running ♪ ♪ And workers who are sunning ♪ ♪ In Spring, the Easter bunny never sleeps ♪ ♪ Bright and early Easter morning ♪ ♪ All the work must be done ♪ ♪ Eggs ready to roll in time for the fun ♪ ♪ For, like Santa Claus, the bunny has not one single day ♪ ♪ There are children waiting everywhere ♪ ♪ Their candy no delay! ♪ ♪ So get all those tulips tended ♪ ♪ And every basket mended ♪ ♪ It's not a game we're playing; it's for keeps! ♪ ♪ Get those bows and ribbons tied on ♪ ♪ For you will be relied on ♪ ♪ Every Spring the Easter bunny never sleeps, never sleeps ♪ [Irontail] I won't allow Cottontail to be the new Chief Easter bunny! I must be the new ruler of April Valley! You, sir? Yes. Years ago, a small child rollerskated over my tail. Since then, I have had to wear this artificial one made of iron, instead of having a nice, fluffy, while cotton tail, like that Peter. But it was an accident, sir. The child didn't mean to- I don't care! Since that time, I have detested all children. But then, why be Easter bunny? To get even, heheh. When I'm through with April Valley, we'll never be bothered by children again. (Laughs) Here, son. Here... is your official egg basket. Carry, carry it with pride. I will, sir! - I hereby officially declare you Chief Easter bun- [Irontail] Just a mean old minute! Hm, hm. Just in time. - For what, Irontail?! - Here is the Constitution of April Valley. It says that the Chief Easter bunny shall be the one who delivers the most eggs. - I know that! That's why I've chosen- - Well, when it comes to delivering eggs, Peter Cottontail is, eheh, real squeamish carrots to January Q. Irontail! I propose a contest to see who can deliver the most eggs. - That's absolutely out of the question! [Peter] Wait a minute, Colonel. I'm not afraid of Irontail. I know I can lick him any day! [Irontail] Ha! - Peter, this is no time for bragging. - No, no, I insist, Colonel! A contest is the fair way of deciding who's best. (softly) Don't worry, it'll be me! - Hehehe, well, you better head wind, Peter. Because once I give my word, I shall stick to it. (crowd chattering) [Colonel] Therefore, I have decided that whoever delivers the most eggs tomorrow, Easter, will be the new ruler of April Valley. (cheers) - (chuckles) You've got to win, Peter. Absolutely have to win. Irontail will do terrible things to April Valley. Make sure, make sure you get up bright and early tomorrow so you can do your best. [Sassafrass] But Peter was so sure he'd win the next day, that instead of getting lots of sleep, he had a big party with all his friends. And it was very late when he finally went to bed. I've gotta get up on time tomorrow! (yawn) Five- thirty, Ben, remember? (tiredly) ♪ There are tulips that need tending ♪ ♪ And baskets that need mending ♪ ♪ In Spring the Easter bunny never sleeps... sleeps... sleeps... [Sassafrass] But you can be certain that old Irontail wasn't going to play fair. [Ben] No funny- no funny- no funny business, now. - (laughs) Oh, no, of course not. I have a little gift for you! Because, uh, well, because I like chickens so much. Aww! Bubbu-bubble-bubblegum! Corn-flavored bubblegum! My f-f-fa-favorite!! (laughs) April Valley is as good as mine! (laughs) (gulp) [Sassafrass] You see, it was magic bubblegum guaranteed to seal the lips of an alarm- clock rooster. Those bubbles cocka-doodle-do'd so far away, Peter never heard them. He slept on and on and on all through Easter day. Now, nobody wanted an egg from an unpleasant old bunny, like Irontail. As a matter of fact, though he tried all day long, he was only able to give away one single egg. However, since Peter slept through Easter and didn't deliver any eggs at all, Irontail won. And he now ruled April Valley. ♪ Every tulip that needs tending ♪ ♪ will get a proper bending ♪ ♪ and jellybeans will rot upon their heaps ♪ Haha! ♪ All the hens who are expecting ♪ ♪ will get no more protecting ♪ ♪ For in Spring the Easter bunny always sleeps! ♪ ♪ And from this time forward, ♪ ♪ all Easter eggs shall be colored ♪ ♪ a shade of mud and new concrete ♪ Haha! ♪ Instead of chocolate bunnies and chicks, I commission the candy sculptors to make tarantulas and octopuses! And I hereby declare an end to Easter bonnets. From now on, there will only be Easter galoshes. (crowd moans) ♪ I need lots of peace and quiet ♪ ♪ and Easter won't deny it ♪ ♪ Every Spring the Easter bunny always sleeps! ♪ (laughs) [Sassafrass] Peter Cottontail, who realized that his bragging and irresponsibility had let everybody down, left April Valley in disgrace. - But- but I'll make it up, somehow! I'll make it up if it's the last thing I do! And that's when I came into the story. Ah, beg pardon, Peter. - Huh? - You're sleeping on my big toe. You really must have been tuckered out to use a big toe as a pillow. - Gee, I'm sorry, Mr. Sassafrass. (chuckles) Well, that's alright. It's my pleasure, Peter. Well, rather my big toe's pleasure, heheh. - Where are we? - In my garden. This is the garden of surprises where I grow all the vegetables I use to make the pretty colors. Heh, it's kinda magical, if I do say so my magical self, heheh! [Peter] Why do you call it the garden of surprises? - Everybody asks that question! And I answer: Why not call it the garden of surprises? I mean, I never know what's coming up. Sometimes I plant beans and roses surprise me. Why, once I planted pumpkins, and do you know what came up? - Huh? No, what? Pumpkins. Now, that was a surprise. Hmm! Well, it's always easier to change colors than to change labels. - Well, nobody will ever be able to change my label... it reads "failure." - Oh, don't be so depressed, Peter! When you are depressed, it gets to be very...erm... depressing! Heheh - But Easter's all over and I lost! - Easter, over? Hah, nothing's ever really all over, Peter. Follow me! There it is. My Yestermorrowber. - Why do you call it your Yestermorrowber? - 'Cause that's what I call it! Heheh. You see, it can transport you into yesterday or tomorrow, whereas most crafts go from here to there, mine travels from now to then, and from then to when. (chuckles) Meet the pilot. Antoine, Antoine! (French accent) Hello, hello, hello. - A worm? [Antoine] Pardon, monsieur. I hold the rank of caterpillar. - We've got our first passenger, Antoine. His name is Peter Cottontail. Now, show him how it all works. - Of course, I will do that, with pleasure. You will notice the many switches and buttons and knobs, eh? (chuckles) They're beautiful, eh? They are labelled le future and le past. And here, of course, we have more controls to transport one to the holidays. A button for Christmas, a lever for Halloween, so, Thanksgiving, Mother's Day, St. Patrick's Day, Valentine's Day, Arbor Day, and this pretty one, for Easter. - Hey! I get it. All I have to do is hop into the basket and have you take me back to Easter! - That's correct. Then you can deliver your eggs, as you should have done in the first place, win the contest, and toss old Irontail out. - Let's go! To Easter, Antoine! - Of course! Oui, certainement, Pierre! Good luck, Peter. - Thanks for everything, Mr. Sassafrass! - But I didn't give you everything. - Huh? ♪ [lyrics] If I could only get back to yesterday ♪ ♪ Today would be a perfect day ♪ ♪ If I could only get back to yesterday ♪ ♪ Oh the different things I'd do and say ♪ ♪ I'd be a different man ♪ ♪ if I had a second chance ♪ ♪ Wouldn't you, wouldn't you? ♪ ♪ I'd make a special plan ♪ ♪ If I had a second chance ♪ [Irontail] A thousand crimson curses, urgh! I forgot all about Sassafrass' silly time machine. Well, hehe, I'll put a creepy crimp in their pathetic plans. (chuckles) Now understand my plans... Now catch up with them, and by all means, play dirty! (laughs) Are we almost at Easter, Antoine? - Soon, Pierre, soon. We are traveling one hundred hours an hour. Hey, there is something that is very wrong with the controls! They indicate approximately to Easter, yet, by my calculations - - mon dieu! Mon dieu, we're coming down! Prepare for the crash- landing! [Sassafrass] And because the control wires were all fouled out, Easter was lost, and they crashed right down in the middle of Mother's Day. (giggling) [Peter] Happy Easter! [Mother] Easter? It's Mother's Day. [Boy] You forgot us on Easter. [Mother] I'll say you did. Oh, I don't mind for myself, but there were no eggs for the children. - And no Easter bonnet for Mom. - Well, I'll make it all up now! Here, my pleasure! - Aw, who wants Easter eggs on Mother's Day? [Sassafrass] And wherever Peter went on Mother's Day, the reaction was exactly the same. Antoine did his best to repair the damaged time controls. - It works! Hehe! And, I, of course, sense a holiday, no? A holiday, yes! But the 4th of July! [Antoine] We are falling! This is an outrageous situation! This is an outrageous situation! [Peter] We made it. [Antoine] That, mon amie, is obvious. Thanks, of course, to my superb piloting. - Superb? We're a long way from Easter. - Ah, well... tell me, Pierre, in the woods of April Valley, does it say the eggs must be given at Easter? - No, but who wants Easter eggs on the 4th of July? They didn't even want them on Mother's Day! - Easter eggs? No. But, uh, 4th of July eggs? What I am saying, mon amie, is that one should and must improvise. ♪ People believe what their hearts tell their eyes ♪ ♪ So when you can't get it all together, improvise ♪ ♪ When you can't get it all together, improvise ♪ ♪ When you can't get it all together, when you can't get it all together, ♪ ♪ When you can't get it all together, improvise! ♪ [Peter] Lucky, Mr. Sassafrass packed a box full of his paints aboard.

[Sassafrass] Oh, it's not that I knew what was gonna happen - not really, heheh. Well, anyway, Peter went out with his 4th of July eggs. Gee, I wonder if anybody will really want my eggs. - Well, that's all, fellas. [Blond boy] Aw, it was just getting good. [Red-haired boy] I'll do anything for more fireworks! - Boy, I could really get rid of these if they were firecrackers! Hmm. - Well, let's go home. - (fake voice) Well, well, well. Hello fellows! - It's a rabbit. - I'm Uncle Sam- Sam, your Independence Day bunny! - We're looking for firecrackers. You got firecrackers, rabbit? - Uh, firecrackers, uh, well as a matter of fact, I do! These are red, white, and blue, uh, egg- shaped torpedoes! You know, you toss them on the ground, and kerbloom! - Oh, boy! Torpedoes! - Wow! We'll take all you got! (Both) Yeah! Gimme! Lemme at 'em!

Watch out! You'll break them! Come on, Antoine, let's go! - What's the matter? - We are coming down again! - Gee, it's so foggy and dank and spooky out! What a terrible Easter! - Easter?! Pierre, we are halfway around the year from Easter. This is H-allowee---n! - Halloween? Hey, wait a minute. I'll paint my eggs orange and black and be, um, be the Halloween bunny! [Irontail] Blast that wretched rabbit! Oh, what am I worrying about? (low chuckle) If I can't defeat Peter Cottontail on Halloween, then when can I? (chuckles) I mean, it's, uh, my kind of day. [Esmeralda] Go ahead, it's your nickle! (wicked laughter) Irontail? Not THE Irontail? January "Boom- Boom" Irontail? [Irontail on phone] Ah, Madame Esmeralda! and how is my favorite witch today? - Well, Halloween's my busy season, dont'cha know. After Halloween, I'm pooped as a petrified poltergeist. (laughs loudly) - Heheh, yes. Well, I wonder if you could find time to do me a little favor, hm-hm? I mean, there's a certain rabbit I want to frighten away. [Esmeralda] Haunt a rabbit? Great! You know me! (laughs) I just love to tease hares! (wicked laughter) [Antoine] Well I... I improvise and I improvise, and still I cannot get it all together. (wicked laughter) [Peter] (laughs) (wicked laugh) - (laughs) Come on, what's the joke? Let me in on it! What's so funny? - There's no joke! I'm a wicked Halloween witch! I do simply horrendous things. I can turn blue and purple and green - BOO! I'm as spooky as Frankenstein! - Hey, that's great! Uh, can you do Colonel Bunny? I can! (Colonel's voice) "Peter, my boy, I have some advice for you." - Aw, you're not supposed to enjoy my evil powers! Oh, I failed. Here I am, only 379, a has- been! (crying) - Oh, uh, don- don- don't cry! I didn't mean to make you unhappy! Say, there's no rule that says a witch can't have a Halloween egg! Here, you may have my first. - For me? A present? Oh, I must tell the whole weirdo community! All the ghosts, witches, werewolves, everybody! They'll be so happy to receive Halloween eggs! Nobody ever thinks to treat the tricksters! (gleeful laughter) [Sassafrass] Well, old Esmeralda rounded up the entire clan and they all wanted one of Peter's eggs. [Irontail] Great mealy- mouthed meatballs, ugh! The skies are laden with egg- crazy race! I cannot let this happen! Peter will win! There's only one way to take care of those eggs- destroy them for good! Montrezaur! Get them and destroy them! Boy, look at all those ghosts! Yowee, I'll have to go back to April Valley for more eggs! No! - Smash them, Montrezaur! Smash them all! (wicked laughter) Those eggs are done for! (laughter) - Take off, Antoine! We've gotta catch those eggs before they hit the ground! - Great twisted tarantulas! Haul those eggs, Montrizaur! Haul them! [Antoine] So, how do we do, eh? - We've got to get back to Halloween so I can give these eggs to the ghosts! - That, I am afraid, mon amie Pierre, is impossible. - No, they couldn't go back. But Antoine had to land his craft so he could continue his repairs. And where do you think they came down? [Peter] Thanksgiving! Oh, just smell all those goodies cooking down there. How do I look? - What. Are you supposed. To be. Eh? An Easter turkey, or Thanksgiving bunny? - Oh, who cares? As long as I can give away these eggs. - Eggs? (hick) Don't mention food to me. I'm stuffed to the gills after this Thanksgiving feast. [Family] We're all stuffed! [Sassafrass] Everybody everywhere was so stuffed that Peter couldn't give away a single egg. - Boy, i- it's cold! - Thank you for this information, I do not realize this fact otherwise, eh. (sneeze) - Antoine! Look up there! Santa Claus! That's why it's so cold! - Well, it must be Noel. Christmas Eve. These stupid controls are still all wet! - Hi, Santa! Hi! - Hello, Peter! - Watch out for Irontail, Santa! - Oh, I'm not afraid, haha. Merry Christmas, Peter! Merry Christmas! - Same to you, Santa!

The street's deserted. - Of course! Everyone has finished with their Christmas shopping, and are now snug and warm at home- eh, you are too late again, mon amie. - I guess so. It seemed like such a good idea! - Well, at least I, too, am snug and warm. Oh- ho- ho. (crying) Gee who's crying? Sounds like it's coming from that hat shop. Gee, it's Bonnie! Bonnie Bonnet! She left April Valley years ago! (tapping) Hi, Bonnie! Why are ya crying? - Oh, Peter! I'm so glad to see you, baby! Nobody wants me! What a way for a lady to end up! Unbought, on Christmas eve! (sobs) - Wait a minute! [Shopkeep] Sorry, I'm closing up. - Uh, b- but, y- you can't leave Bonnie all alone on Christmas eve! - Ah, that ridiculous hat? Who wants an Easter bonnet this time of year? - I'll take her. I'm sure I can find a home for Bonnie. - You, a silly little rabbit? Whatever would you use for money? - Oh, I have lots of money! Darn it. Wait a minute. I'll trade you my Christmas eggs for Bonnie. - Christmas eggs? - Yeah, see? In that basket out there on the sidewalk. [Shopkeep] Why, they're beautiful! - Deal? - Deal. - Dea-l! - Deal! - Deal? (all laugh) - Gee, I forgot I was wearing this Santa suit. [Shopkeep screams] - What is it? - Somebody's stealing the Christmas eggs! It's another rabbit! - Careless, careless! Hehehe Musn't let these things lie about! (wicked laugh) Yes, Peter Cottontail! This time, I'm personally taking care of these eggs. Away, away Montrizaur! Awa-y! - Come back! Come back with those eggs! [Antoine] I do insist you return those eggs! - I shall hide these eggs where you will never find them again! (laughs) - We've got to catch him! [Antoine] Pierre! Pierre! P-Pierre! W- why do you go off without your friend? - Hang on, Bonnie! [Bonnie] Not so fa-a-ast! - Can't go slow, Bonnie. I've got to catch Irontail! The whole future of April Valley depends on it! - Pierre! Pierre! Come back for me! - Antoine! Antoine, we forgot all about it! We must go back! B- But I can't! I can't! I don't know how to make it go backwards! - Au revoir, mon amie! Au revoir! - You ridiculous rabbit, ha! You'll never catch me! (laughs) - What are you doing with those eggs? Well, you know they belong to Peter Cottontail. - Oh, why don't you stick to your own holiday? [Sassafrass] Hm, well Santa got the egg basket back to Peter, and poor Peter, he couldn't even stop the Yestermorrorber, not even to say thank you. - I sure do miss Antoine. [Sassafrass] Peter thought he'd try being the New Year's Eve bunny, but he couldn't bring the Yestermorrowber to a stop. - It's no use. I'll never figure out how to run this thing. I guess we're lost, lost up here in time. - You never tried this one, Peter! It says "stop." - Huh? A- As a matter of fact, I was just about to try that button out. - Oh, how beautiful! What is it? - All those heart lanterns! It must be a St. Valentine's Day skating party! Sure, that's it! Bonnie, do you know what I'm gonna do? - Don't tell me, let me guess.

Oh, heheh, hi. - I hate to bother you, but could you help me put my skates on? - Oh, no bother at all! - My name's Donna. - Hi, Donna. - Oh, I recognize you from your picture in the paper. You're Peter Cottontail. - Oh, no, my name's Harold. Uh, Harold Hossenfeffer. Aw... I guess I'm Peter Cottontail. - Well, you shouldn't be ashamed. Anybody can make one mistake. You just overslept. - Gee, t-that's a kind thing to say. - I mean it. - Yeah... yeah! Donna, would you skate with me? - I'd love to. But aren't you going somewhere with those eggs? - Ah, they can wait. Here, for you. - Oh, Peter! A Valentine!
