How are you doing? Eh, I guess I'm okay. - Sit down. - Thank you. The reason I brought you together this evening is... this year I turn 80, and I'll be over the hill. So I have decided to take this occasion to retire. Now, about my successor... Hanamura. I think it is proper that you take over. The second generation of the Doba Family. The head of the family has heavy responsibilities. I assume you approve and are prepared. Yes. Thank you very much, Boss, for bestowing your guidance upon us over a truly long time. Although I am just still training in the business, I intend to double my devotion and lay down my life for the sake of expanding the Doba Family to a new level. Then do it. Yes, sir. By the way... we must hold a reception to celebrate this succession. Well, concerning that... with the new laws in the world now, I'm thinking that it is not a good idea to needlessly provoke the police or media. So I think we can just make it a small affair. Hanamura! Don't misunderstand me! It will be a grand occasion to celebrate my retirement! Hell, I was the one who built this family! I raised you up from the post-war black market under my personal care. So allow me this! Our first succession ceremony. Why do we need to refrain from this auspicious honor? Are you that afraid of the new laws? Who cares about the cops! They're just... Boss! Hanamura! Do your job! Hurry, hurry. Toshi, please understand Boss's feelings. For Boss's sake, too, we must have a magnificent ceremony. Brother Tabuchi, you be preparation chairman. I'm counting on you. Sendo. Yes. You help him and take charge of everything. Yes. Brother Tominaga, you take care of the money. Yes, sir. With that, I thank you all. Yes. Ceremony Day Decided: An Auspicious Day in July. Special Expenses: Decided. Suizan Inn Ceremony Venue: Decided Similar to a matchmaker at a wedding ceremony, the mediator Mediator: Decided Similar to a matchmaker at a wedding ceremony, the mediator Mediator: Decided shoulders an important role in Yakuza pledge ceremonies. The arbitrator, like a priest at a wedding, Arbitrator: Decided The arbitrator, like a priest at a wedding, Arbitrator: Decided is in charge of the ceremony. Celebration of July 1992 Guests' Sign-in Book KEISHO SAKAZUKI (Succession) Four Days Before the Succession Ceremony How do you feel, Boss? It's nothing to worry about. It's just an exam. It's nothing. Go ahead and ask the doctor. About the arbitration, yes, I'll diligently conduct it. This is a problem. We cannot have the ceremony without an arbitrator. In six months, we've managed to decide on a mediator, on seating arrangements, and on reception hall preparations. The ceremony is just four days away, so we cannot afford to take any chances. Go find someone to take his place. A substitute? Think of it as insurance. If Karigane can arbitrate, that'll be fine. But if he can't, we'll have a substitute do it. Go find a replacement, and don't let Karigane know. There's nobody who'll do it with just four days' notice! We will pay. It's not the money, arbitrators have a lot of pride in their social status. You were a huckster, weren't you? Which family? The Umegasaki Family in Ibaraki. Are they affiliated with Mr. Karigane? No, they are not. Ok, go fetch Umegasaki. That's an order. Persuade the replacement of his fate, and drag him back here. Three Days Before the Succession Ceremony "Persuade the replacement of his fate and drag him in." What the hell's he talking about? Is he friggin' joking?! Stupid boss! Stupid order! Screw it all! He knows nothing about Umegasaki's boss... The guy will lose it when he hears the word "substitute." We'll be killed! Is that Umegasaki boss really such a fearsome guy? Nobody could beat him. But if anyone did defeat him, he'd become famous. From Hokkaido in the north to Okinawa in the south, proud and crazy fighters came to challenge him. And he'd tear 'em to pieces, just tear 'em to pieces... STOP! I'm son-y! How stupid can you be?! Hey, move it! I'll kill you! Sure is nice weather today, isn't it... You idiot! You suck. I'll drive! Chief, do you know how to drive? We con men, you know, drive trucks all over the country! Chief, maybe slow down on curves. Shut the hell up! Our meeting's at 1:00. If we're one minute late, fists will be flying. Concentrate on driving. What time is it? It's only 12:00. Okay, let's call him. Dial his number. Okay, go ahead. Go ahead? Remember the number. It's (0292) 23-3456. Okay. Hello. Is this the Umegasaki Family? Oh, Boss, thank you for personally taking my call. This is Shigata. We are on the way to your place. We will most definitely come visit you at 1:00. Thanks... thank you very much. An accident? Ambulance? You friggin' idiot! Don't you know what'll happen if the cops hear about it? You will be dragged away and arrested! Huh? Don't worry about Shigeta. Geez-just leave him there! Okay. I'm sorry, Chief. - Do not forget the cash! - The cash? Thank-you money for the arbitrator. Shigeta has it. Chief, please get a grip. The cash... I got it. Sony. You understand? Bring the replacement, at any cost, to Tokyo today. You want me to do it? Is anyone else there? Beg on your knees if you have to! No, but I think it'll be impossible. Look. I'd like to ride. C'mon! Did he understand? Uncle, rent me your horse! MY horse? Just for a bit. How about a hundred dollars. - I'm a rich rice farmer. - C'mon, c'mon. I'll introduce you to some young ladies. Wait! Hold on. Move it, horse! One passenger! Get ahead of it! The road split. Damn it! Excuse me. Congratulations! Ibaraki-guchi, Ibaraki-guchi. Wait! Train! Whoa! One person transferring! One adult ticket. Thank you very much for your patronage. This train is bound for Hitachi Factory. Yes on Route 294. Yeah. A black van has flipped over in a rice field. About one critical injury. Please send an ambulance. If not a Mercedes, an American car or such is fine. We ain't got no foreign minivans way out hare. - Okay, any car is okay. - We ain't got that either. Isn't this a car rental place?! It says you have everything from busses to tractors! Go ahead and make fun of a rural car rental place. I guess I was being impatient and said too much. Anything's okay as long as it runs. Joso Rent-a-Car Auntie... Auntie! A-a-a-untie! What?! Oops. What're you catching? Clams. Ahh, for miso soup. The extract. The extract? Liver medicine. Ah, liver medicine for your Dad who likes to drink. What the heck are you tryin' to do? You tryin' to hit on me up here? No, no...? Should I? Actually um, I'm looking for the Umegasaki Boss's house. Thanks. Bye-bye. What an unsociable woman... Umegasaki Guess this is what you'd call a "Mito Mercedes." Tear them apart one by one... one by one. You don't need a sword to kill a street vendor... Three days of rain would be enough. Peddling blue skies must be tough, too. I don't need no newspaper. - I'm not selling newspapers. - Then what? I've come to see the honorable boss. - The boss? - Yes. I am the boss. How rude of me. Um, I am a new member of the Doba Family. My name is Shoichi Yoshinari. You're from the Doba Family? Excuse me. The Doba Family... you must be Shigeta's underling? I drove here with him. What happened to Shigeta? He said one o'clock... Well, about that... Actually we had an accident, and he's in critical condition. I was going to call you right after he was taken to the ER, but then the police came to take their report. No way I could call you with them right there, so I'm late. You must be angry, and I am deeply sorry. You sure do talk a lot, don't you. You're not a yakuza at heart, are you? Could you tell? I did sales for a brokerage firm. The truth is that I've only been a yakuza for a few months. I'm no teen-aged punk, so why the heck did I join this world? You may wonder that. I wonder that myself. Woman problems? Money problems? Hah, probably both. Is she your daughter? Nope, that's my wife. Oh, so you are the boss's wife?! I'm so sorry about what happened before. He is from the Doba Family. My name is Shoichi Yoshinari. I have not heard from Shigeta for decades and then he suddenly calls. What in the world does he want? Yes, about that... I am only here because Shigeta couldn't come. So please understand that, and kindly listen to me. You are free to refuse, so I entreat you to not become angry. Okay, okay, enough with the preface. This is truly a difficult thing to say. It has been decided that we will hold a second generation succession ceremony. I heard about it. The police have their eyes on us, even cracking down on our previously overlooked pachinko prize exchanges. The damn media, our enemy is making a big deal of it. We underlings wonder, "Why the pompous ceremony?" especially in these times. That's what being a yakuza is. If a father tells a son to do something, he naturally obeys. I completely agree with you, sir. For that ceremony, the arbitrator was to be... It's Mr. Karigane, isn't it? Well, yesterday, Mr. Karigane was suddenly hospitalized. Even though I am making this request on behalf of Shigeta, I know that it is truly, truly impolite, but would you... Praise Amida Buddha, Praise Amida Buddha. ...possibly consider being the substitute? "Sunny, sunny monk boy Sunny monk boy "Give us some nice weather tomorrow "Like a heavenly dream once upon a time "If it clears, I'll give you a golden bell." And our boss said, even if you end up not doing it, please accept the fee. I know this very rude, but here is money for the preparations. Preparation Money "Sunny sunny monk boy Sunny monk boy "Send us some nice weather tomorrow "If it should get cloudy and the sky weeps "Them I'll snip your head off!" Please. Huh? Please, this way. I thank you for coming. I am Daisaku Monden, head of the eleventh generation of the Umegasaki Family of Joshu. I am pleased to make your acquaintance. Ah... yes, thank you. Please raise your head. Yes. The messenger's words have indeed been delivered. As for me, I will respectfully endeavor to be the substitute for the honorable Mr. Karigane. Does that mean you accept the request?! Tokyo Royal Palace Hotel I am Sendo of the Hanamura branch of the Doba Family. Although I'm inexperienced, I am in charge of the ceremony. On this day, I would like to humbly and truly thank you for taking this unreasonable task to heart. What about that Shigeta jerk saying no way he'd accept it? Man, he was mad as hell. As soon as I said substitute, he thrust his sword into the floor. I thought I was gonna be killed. Anyway, I kept on bowing and begging on my knees, and so, in the end, my tears finally won him over. Mr. Karigane must not know about the substitute. Do not forget that. Yes, I really drilled it into him that this was his fate. - You take care of them. - What? Stay here overnight and look after them. Just detain them here until the ceremony is over. Hirase, give him the money. Have him write "self-employed" when he checks into this hotel. The cops are on edge. By law, checking in under an alias can get you arrested. Am I "self-employed," too? You idiot. Don't write any company, just "employee." San-in Misasa, Hot Springs Resort Guests have arrived! Thank you for coming. Please, this way. Welcome. We don't have reservations. Take us to your priciest room. Escorting guests. Guests have arrived! How is this room? Is it to your liking? It is perfect. Well, that's good. You must be hungry. There are good restaurants outside, but this hotel's Chinese restaurant has quite the reputation. Chinese. Boss it looks like it's all rented out. That's a problem for a first-class hotel. Okay, Boss, let's try someplace outside. No, my wife is tired tonight, so how about that yakiniku place? Yakiniku? Are you really okay with oolong tea? The important ceremony is near at hand. On such occasions, I do not drink. Spoken like a pro. I should take the words of a wise man to heart. Is she the one who drinks that clam extract? "Bum like a flame Desire "I can't get as crazy about love "As I can about dance, dance, dance. "Oh, yeah, I am lonely "Get up, get up, get up, burning heart." Yes, clap, clap. I am the resort owner. This is truly impolite, but since you are a first-time guest, would you mind paying a small deposit? Take it all. Please do not joke like that, sir. You saying that's not enough money? If that's so, then take this. Boy, that lady is a big drinker. But he sure is a looker. What's she doing with the yakuza? Who knows? Even I'm a yakuza. The Tokyo Stock Exchange has announced that this period's general statement reflects the stock market's extreme sluggishness. Capitalized gains and losses... Mom and Dad probably think I'm still working for the securities company. Hello, Yoshinari residence... Mom, it's me. Sho-chan! You okay? You haven't called for a while. How are ya doin'? I'm okay How are you? Well, you know, father retired, right? I was looking forward to sleeping in everyday, but... Why? I was born in a normal family in Hiroshima. I went to college in Tokyo. Got a job in Tokyo. At a stock brokerage. Oh, were you in the middle of something? Hey, Brother. Why are you here with Mr. Sakamoto? Didn't you tell me something last time? You said there's an interesting stock. You mean Ibuki Pharmaceuticals? Yeah. Our family, too, has to somehow get more money. We have to make loads of money in some way. Sakamoto will supply the funds. You'll get burned with Ibuki Pharmaceuticals. Heh, who the hell is he? This idiot lost all our extra money. Yeah, this jerk said we'd definitely make money. Stay outta this! You want some more punishment? You want more?! That thirty grand was just chicken feed, man. I'm also known as "The Cobra of Kabuto Financial District." No man would sit silent after being played by a punk like you! Be obedient and return the money. If not, you'll pay with your life? You choose! If I had any money to return, I'd have returned it long ago! Go ahead - kill me quickly. Do it quickly! Hold on, young man. Stop trying to look cool. You wanna throw away your life for a measly 30 grand? Give me a break! You're not the only ones to whom I owe money. I've been stealing and losing my company's money, too. Fm going to jail anyway. - So isn't it better to die? - Wait, wait! He's always been a broker who can't make money. This guy with the lip service? A broker'? That's not a good fit. Okay. You want me to become a yakuza? Okay, I'll do it! I know my brokerage's system inside and out. I'll blackmail them with that knowledge and pay you back. Remember this! I will faithfully return my debt to you, tied with a ribbon. I'll even add in the interest. How's your job doin'? I quit that. Now I'm job-hopping. Job-hopping? What's that? It's like doing part-time jobs. Where are you calling from today? The Hotel Royal Palace. Some firms let part-timers use such high-priced hotels? Well, that is because I am that highly valued. If it's such a good firm, then you must work hard so they'll make you an employee. Yes, yes. Good night. I'll call you again. I'm in front of the resort. According to police, The suspect who has barricaded himself in there is Taka Endo, ex-leader in the Doba Family of Tokyo organized gangs. This evening around six, he and his common-law wife entered the resort... He shot again. Again. - Oh my god. - This is a very dangerous scene. Obey police instructions. Get down over there! Okay, storm in. Riot police have finally stormed in and apparently overpowered him. I told them they'd get burned by Ibuki. I can see the suspect Taka Endo. Endo and Doba Family members were under police surveillance. This April they lost money on Ibuki Pharmaceuticals stocks. Endo ran away, leaving behind huge debts. Signs indicate he had little money to escape and so was driven into a comer. The suspect, Endo, was arrested in the end. You bastard. Why're you runnin' to the stinking cops?! Give it back. Gimme my money back! Two Days Before the Succession Ceremony It's open. Good morning. Boss? Boss, what happened to you? My wife drinks so damn much, I can't do anything about it. She was a raging drunk all night. I couldn't get a wink of sleep. She drank all this? She drank all of these? That's gotta be tough on you. She drinks like this every day? Nothing needs to be done now, so please keep resting. Boss called, so I'm going to the ceremony hall. - The ceremony hall? - Yes. Me, too. I'm going, too. I have to preview the hall in case I'm needed to serve as arbitrator. Boss, they all won't fit in two rows. Well, we have to make three rows then. The problem is... who are we gonna have in the third row. Boss. Oh, hello. I came to take a look around the hall for future reference. Yes, please this way. Headquarters just contacted us about the attendants, Boss. - Please excuse me - Don't worry about me. Just getting calligraphers for name banners is difficult. No. This artful writing is called "kaki-age." That sounds tasty, doesn't it? Actually, it kinda sounds like tempura. "Kaki-age" is the writing of the names of the bosses from all over Japan who will be present. Even the tiniest mistake is not permitted. It is a sacred act. Boss wants you. Excuse me. What do you want, Boss? Why'd he come here? He said he wanted to preview the venue. Karigane left the hospital, and will arrive here soon. It's a big problem if they meet, so have him leave immediately. - Okay. - Yoshinari. This is important. Go get Shigeta's finger. My chiefs finger? When I demoted him, he said he wanted a respectable life. That's what The Family does. When any member leaves The Family on his own, we slice off his finger. Be sure to remember this. Yes. I... um, my boss suddenly... needs me for something. I should be back in the evening. Please go back and relax at the hotel and I'll pick you up for dinner again. - Thank you for coming out. - I am the arbitrator. - How are you doing? - Ahh, don't worry. I'm fine. Actually this was not my original job. I was used, by a boss ten years my junior. In public, I was called a worthless idiot. I felled one command and now at my age I have to return to a regular job? You know any good businesses I could get into? I truly understand your feelings. I really understand, but I hear this is "Family Policy." Gimme my gun. Surely you know that when members leave The Family, saying they want to make an honest living, they always have to chop a finger off. Gimme the gun. C'mon, Chief. If I don't bring your finger back... that boss will have my finger snipped instead. Please, let's just do this. Be a man. - What did you come to do? - Not me, my boss... You gonna have your finger cut off? It's painful. I don't like it. Chop your finger off? No. - I do not like this. - I don't wanna cut it either. Stop! Force him, and you'll be committing bodily harm. Bodily harm? - I'm calling the police - Whaddya doin'? - What're you thinking? - What are YOU thinking! Wait! Ouch-ouch-ouch! Dammit... That hurt. Is something wrong with your finger, too, sir? After I was told to cut the pinky, my stomach... Some stomach medicine? You have a headache? We have aspirin, too. Please. With water. Maybe this business doesn't suit me either. What's this guy? If you bother a pro, you're gonna get burned. What?! Tryin' to act cool, huh? You bastard! Get him! Damn. I'll call an ambulance. You punk! Okay, okay, let me go. My stomach hurts. My head hurts. Mine goes up easily. Ah, it's back. In that case... I told you you're gonna get burned. Someone will help him. Thanks. Shigeta Hello. Ah, is this you, madam? This is Yoshinari. I know I'm late. I'd like to speak with Boss. He's gone to sleep. Is that so? I thought I'd be back earlier in the evening, but I got in another car accident. Yes, especially since we had reservations at Tokyo's best tempura restaurant. Please convey to him my sincere apology concerning my lateness. Yes, I will come by again to see how you two are doing tomorrow. Good night. Are the clothing stores here still open? Yes. Boss Daisaku's clothing allowance, and such, is about $4,000. This, yes, this. Hello. Is this you, madam? Sony to bother you again. This is Yoshinari. Did I not tell you that he was asleep? No, not him I would like to talk to you about something in person. It won't take long. I'll meet you downstairs in the main bar in ten minutes. Thank you. Yes, yes. This is Yoshinari. It's me. Yes, it's me. Dad? Where are you now? Your mom was wondering what kind of company lets its part-timers stay in high-class hotels. She's worried that maybe you're doing some strange thing again. Hare, this is from Mom. Do you really not trust me? No, no. I was relieved to see your face. You don't do bad things. You have a good and kind face. - Right? - Yes, that's right. They've been smiling and looking at me for a while. Are they college students? Maybe I'll go ask them? - No, Shoichi. It's rude. - No, it's okay. - The one on the left, yeah? - Uh, yeah. Can you keep that gentleman over there company all night? Sure, I can. $1,000 for you. And $500 for you. You be a student from Sacred Hearts. And you be from Gakushu-in. You're both sophomores. Take him out of here for me within thirty seconds. So what do you want? If you're looking for romance, find another woman. Far from romance. No, I have a favor to ask you concerning your husband. Having said that, you aren't drinking today, are you? What did you want to say? It's about your husband this morning. You were drinking all last night, and lost all control. And, well, Boss couldn't get a wink of sleep. If he gets so tired out that ha won't be able to serve as arbitrator, I'll have to take responsibility. And I would get more than a scolding from our leader. Is there something funny? I'm being serious here. After the ceremony in two days, you're free to drink as much as you want. Our boss won't be sewing as arbitrator. Mr. Karigane was released from the hospital. He's an 80-year-old grandpa. And he's got a bad heart. And we have no idea when he might keel over again. What shall I get for you? Chinese wine. - We do not have that - Weren't you listening? Chinese wine. I'll have oolong tea. If by chance Boss is called upon and does a bad job, it will be your fault. Women like you... ruin men. Again and again... I put money in, but why, oh why do you reject it? Out of Stock but why, oh why do you reject it? But why, oh why do you reject it? I'm still in training for this occupation. Please forgive me in advance for misspeaking... Every last one of those guys need to... just stop makin' a fool outta me. Excuse me, are you related to the deceased? Or are you a friend? Do you live in the neighborhood? From the Staff at Taiyo Company Stupid Karigane. Stupid Sasagogawara ceremony style. An arbitrator must write the "kaki-age" with his soul. It'd be better to have nothing than to have this garbage. Don't touch our company name cards, you bastard! You, you get outta here! Get out! Damn you! Ah, there's Grandpa! The Day Before the Succession Ceremony We will begin the ceremony on time tomorrow. Your boss wants to see the Giants' game tonight? Yes, I see. I will somehow take care of it. They're sold out! Huh? They cancelled the Shinkansen and took a plane? By plane... Get your ass to Haneda! - Let's go! - Hurry to Haneda! Hey, the cops are tailing you! They'll haul you in for any violation, so be careful! The name-taking succession and retirement cups are the especially celebratory parts of the sake-exchange pledge. In Sasagogawara Style, we decorate gorgeously and generously. Yes, sir, this is truly magnificent. Now tomorrow’s ceremony is all on your shoulders. Thank you in advance for your efforts. I'll take care of it. In my eighty years, I've sewed as arbitrator dozens, hundreds of times. Hey, Tominaga, get out here! Gimme my money 'back! Outta my way! Come, Sakamoto, let's talk about this later. Thanks to you, asshole, I've been dishonored. I went bankrupt! As discussed merely loaned the funds to Endo but then you bastards made this mess by taking my money. I absolutely do not permit wearing shoes in here before the ceremony! Shaddup. Beat it, old man! Hey! Do you have any idea who you're talkin' to? Huh? I'm broke! I ain't got nothin' else to lose! Thirty million dollars. Return that thirty million to me. Or you want me to destroy your ceremony? Pull yourself together President. Die, you! Get him...die! Doba Stop that. Hey, be careful in the water. Boss won't be called by the police or anything, will he? Boss will riot be troubled at all. I will manage and take responsibility for tomorrow’s succession ceremony. Don't worry about it at all. Yes, madam. This necklace is for Mom. A necktie for Yan. And a patterned cloth shirt for you, Dad. I also put your hotel bill on my expanse account. Is it really okay? Thanks for taking care of everything. - What? - You smell like perfume. - Really? - Nah, just kidding. If you act nervous, Mom will know. To the Yaesu gate. Keep the change. Dad take this. See you. - Hey, idiot! - Bro'. You turned your phone off? Boss is really pissed! His wife got really drunk, so I was busy dealing with that. Whatever. The arbitrator collapsed and the hall is in shambles. "Um! up - get in! So, did you find another venue for the ceremony? I'm sorry, but no, we did not. Me killing myself is not gonna solve this problem. Caterers are running around for the sake of our boss. Boss will be disgraced. But not only that... Our Family will lose face completely, and be the laughingstock of the industry. None of us will be able to make a living. This is the critical moment of our Family collapsing or not. You understand this, don't you? Find a venue! Don't stop until you find it! Yes, sir. Chairman, I have an idea. - What? Who're you? - He's a new member. Idiot. How dare you address the chain-nan directly! Hold on. If he has something to say, let him say it. Yes. At this late time, I think it's impossible to find a regular ceremony hall. Two days ago, I saw that the Chinese restaurant in my hotel was completely rented out. This was at the Royal Palace. That place would be large enough. You think Chinese is okay for the sake-exchange pledge? Isn't that like a wedding at a noodle shop? We can paint over the gaudy red walls, get rid of tables and chairs, and lay down tatami mats. Call them. I'll talk. Connect me with President Tsurumaki. Just tell him it's Hanamura of the Doba Family. Ah, President... No. ... actually I have a special favor to ask of you. You have a Chinese restaurant, right? Yes, we'd like to rent it out from now and all day tomorrow. Hey, stupid, this is your once-in-a-lifetime chance to do a favor for me. Who the hell was it that saved your company when it was being taken over? The cops? Tell them you didn't know you rented it to yakuza. Say you've already accepted the deposit. And that you can't cancel now. Deal with it! Got it? I got the ceremony hall. Let's go do it at Fukujuro's in Royal Palace. Unloading instructions are over here. You're all right, all right. His chance to become arbitrator has come... It's true! Boss will finally become a true arbitrator, rather than a substitute. I've been really selling them on him and somehow! was able to pull some strings and... - Where are you goin'? - To pick up Boss. Driver... To the Kanto Funeral Home at 27 Sanei-cho. Yes, got it. Funeral home? Did an acquaintance or someone pass away? I haven't seen anyone so incredible in quite a while. Here is samurai-like mercy. Now go take him back. - Well. - Okay. If he didn't have this on him, there'd have been a big problem if I'd had no way to contact you. Thank you for your concern. Here is a small token of apology... for all the inconvenience that we have caused. Does this happen all the time? That must be very difficult for you, too, madam. - Manager Akaishi? - Yes. Excuse me. Give them a ride to their hotel... and use our car. So it's you who's the drunkard... And the clam extract... You really had me fooled. Yet you brazenly kept on drinking... Boss, you gotta get yourself together. We're here. It's the calligrapher. Please, this way. Madam, please go ahead on up to your room. - So the papers are ready? - Yes. Bro, this is a mistake. Let's go down to the basement, please. What's a hearse doing here? - This is not a good omen. - Let them through. A little more. - We need more help. - We'll get more people soon. Mannequins coming through. Boss, please pull yourself together. You're gonna be the arbitrator! - Huh? Me? - Yes, you're on. Mr. Karigane unexpectedly had a heart attack. So you are going to be the arbitrator. - Really? - Yes, it's true. The day to shine has come, has it not, madam? Brush... ink-stone! Ink-stone? What's he talking about? - He's feeling like "kaki-age." - "Kaki-age"? Ah, those name banners. Not "name banners." I told you, it's "kaki-age." It's not a tempura restaurant. Forget about that, for now. "Kaki-age" is an arbitrator's life! Are you serious, man? There's a hundred sheets? Writers are quickly doing them downstairs. Let them do it. They must let me handle it. It has to be the arbitrator's job! Or else I can't do it! I won't do it! Madam, say something. You know better than anyone that he's useless right now. If we don't somehow get that man to serve properly as arbitrator, and get my boss's seal of approval, I'm gonna fail and will have a hard time. Or else, madam, will you chop off my finger for me? Guz' I really hate pain. I'm not the only one who will have failed. You've been listening to me with indifference for a while, but it's your husband who is the biggest failure. He can't work drunk. We'd be the joke of the industry. Is he saying, "The hell with it"? Ha can't remain a yakuza then. I would prefer that. I hate the yakuza. After all, he cannot quit the yakuza on his own, so this time if he disgraces himself and cannot continue as a yakuza, I'll be happy. Whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa. What word did you spit out? "Disgrace himself"? And you hate yakuza? Who was that yakuza you fell in love with? - Fell in love with? - Yeah. - Me? - Yeah. Who? With you. Now is not the time for you two to be quarreling. Boss, so you can really write those name banners? Not "name banners"! Yes, "kaki-age." I'm sorry. Can you really write them now? If I said I could write them, I can write the! "Kaki-age!" "Kaki-age!" Stop, stop! We're gonna do 'em all over! - Whaddya mean? - Who cares? The arbitrator said he will rewrite them all. How dare you talk to your sworn brother that way! Ah, no good. I can't get into it. Bring me a drink. Really? You call yourself a man? You just promised you'd write without drinking. I didn't say that to you. Bring me a drink. If you want to drink, why not go drink and come back? Madam, what are you sayin'? If he drinks one, he won't be able to stop. You're the one who said if he gets sloshed, he can't serve as arbitrator tomorrow. Crap! Yes? Hey. The way you just talked to me... I'm busy. Spit it out! Is the writing done? He's writing now! That little... Oh, excuse me. Hey, you! This ain't over. Excuse us. Yo! Harassing regular people plays right into the cops' hands. Please control yourself. All right. It's the chairman. The soon-to-be successor Chairman Hanamura is here! Sake. Bring me sake. I'm fine with showing him in this shape. Then it'll be over. Finished. If II be refreshing. And after that, I'll be the one who'll chop off my finger. I told you I hate pain. Boss, bear with me for a sec, just pretend you're writing. Sake... Madam. Sake... Oh, Chairman. And Boss. Well, please. On top of requesting the arbitrator, I thought I'd greet him. We did make arrangements for calligraphers, but he... said that writing name banners is an arbitrator's life. Now, like that, he's writing alone with great urgency. Is that so? Then maybe we shouldn't interrupt him. That's true... he is concentrating right now. - I am very sorry. - No, that's okay. When you have a chance, tell him I stopped by just for a greeting. - Yes. - Yo. What are these mannequins for? This is, um... to master person placement of the ceremony. Hey. I'll give him the message. Mark my words. After all this is over... I'm gonna whack this bozo with my shoe. Boss, excuse me. I beg of you to stick to it! By any means, please finish writing the name banners. Not "name banners," "kaki-age." Name banners. "Kaki-age." Name banners. Ka-ki-a-ge. Okay as you say it's "kaki-age." Then please finish the "kaki-age." Sake. Well, after that the future will take care of itself. Here, Boss, drink all you want. So for now, let's have you write all of them. I won't stop you. Drink all you want, do a terrible job, then please quit being yakuza. Listen, you. You want this mug ripped up? - You want it? - That's a yakuza! An unraveled yakuza, right! I wonder howl ended up with this man. I did not want to be the wife of a yakuza. I was born into a regular family in Tokyo, moved to Mito for Dad's job. After high school I got a job at a credit union. I was 18! And the first time my boss took ma to a bar, I met him. I had no idea that he was a yakuza. He seemed far more eloquent than the boss I was with. He hid his Ibaraki accent and asked me... "What's your blood type?" I'm O-type, he's B-type. "Hey, B and O are compatible. What's your sign?" "I'm Virgo," he says. A yakuza who's a Virgo... that's a freakin' lie. I was suddenly deceived. In a relatively short time I had given him $700K. On top of that, my parents disowned me and my relatives severed connections. Even so, fool that! am, I supplied him money intentionally and served three years in jail for him. He bought a diamond ring... and was waiting for me when I got out. And again, I was suddenly fooled. After we got married, he sold the ring off. All gambling and women. Gambling and women. Of course! I'm disgusted with him. This time I'm leaving you. Leaving me? I'm kicking you out. Take that... from the head of a large... 100-year-old family. I'm tired of hearing about the head of the large family. You have zero followers. And you shamelessly accepted the $30,000 preparation money. I'm not such a worthless guy. So why didn't you refuse it? Women... do women understand men's feelings? I do not want to understand. Even a yakuza's worth is decided by money these days. Does making a lot of money make you a great yakuza? They're just merchants. If you don't have any money, you won't attract youngsters. Oh, oh, oh... what has this world coma to? The old days were good. The Inari Festival... the broiled squid at the beach house... com, lots of young men. The 11th generation of Umegasaki will collapse on my watch. I am so sorry. Who are you apologizing to? A boss brings a family together then his duty is to choose his successor. Look, if you're gonna apologize, apologize to me. Do you not understand my feelings of having my family collapse on my watch? You haven't done anything good for me. Apologize to me! I was mortified to hear that I was the substitute. But such are the times. Maybe this is the last time for yakuza to have such a big succession announcement ceremony. Though I'm the substitute, I may need to perform. If I the family destroyer, get the chance to serve as arbitrator, I want them to remember that "The Umegasaki Family is here!" Let's make that memory! So let's make the name banners for that purpose. - It's "kaki-age." - "Kaki-age." "Kaki-age." Yes. Okay. I'll do it! - Let's write. - Ok, let's write. - Put the sake over there. - Okay. Let's get fired up with a solid hit. Let's do it!! No, YOU hit ME. Who? Me? Here goes... Please forgive me. Not like that. Boss. - Are you okay? - I'm all right. Spread the paper out nicely... nicely. I beg of you. Nicety now. That's good. - Rub down the ink-stick. - Yes. Um, madam. Facing batter #4, O'Malley. The first pitch is a strike... Hida is on the mound, throwing the second pitch... Yo, the game's already started. - I just got 'em. - Hurry up! What's that, now? $1,000 for one? Is that a $500 ticket? Those punks are rippin' us off...! Who's the yakuza here?! Stop it, you Idiot! Red, number ten. Bingo! Bingo! Bingo! Are these prizes okay? We'll exchange them later. Do not let them gamble with money at this place. - If cops come in, it's over. - Yes, okay. Boss. They're all done. I got it. You did it, didn't you? And you didn't need the alcohol to do it. Thanks. No mistakes, right? Right. Megumi. Megumi? Wow, that was scary. Thank you for tomorrow. And thank you. I hear the ceremony depends on the arbitrator. With Boss, I'm sure it'll all be fine. - Thanks so much for today. - It was nothing. I should thank you And sorry about criticizing you. That's mutual. Um! Good night. Good night. Sho-chan, it's me. Thanks for the tie. And then... about your gift for the wedding... just a little is okay. Okay, see you. Shoichi, for you to be passed by your little brother is disappointing. That's why I told you... Dad, want me to tell Mom about your affair? Hold on a sec, Dad. Yes? Madam? What happened? I have nowhere to go. Hold me... Please hold me. Madam... Hay, Shoichi. With this... now I can leave him. Why didn't you break up with him until now? Being divorced once is not such a big deal these days. Divorced from a yakuza. Who will take a woman like that? How about me...? You're a yakuza, too. Breaking up with one yakuza, than marrying another... is repeating the same thing. Well, if 1... No. What's all that noise? I'm checking now, so please wait a second. "If you hear my request, "I'll let you drink lots of sweet sake. "Sunny, sunny monk boy Sunny monk boy "Send us some nice weather tomorrow "If it should get cloudy and the sky weeps "Then I'll snip your head off! "Sunny, sunny monk boy Sunny monk boy "Sunny, sunny monk boy Sunny monk boy "Send us some nice weather tomorrow." Sir, please get a hold of yourself. - Are you all right? - Take him to the lobby for now. - Please wait. - Excuse us. Honey, it's me! Yeah? It's me. You understand don't you? Okay, let's go. "Sunny, sunny monk boy Sunny monk boy" I had a dream. It was in mid-ceremony, and I was paralyzed... and couldn't move at all. I was painfully embarrassed in front of everyone. When I woke up you weren't there. "Sunny, sunny monk boy Sunny monk boy "Send us some nice weather tomorrow" If that man gets so crazy in the head with sake, then he cannot perform the important duty of arbitrator. Right? I can only resign myself to kindly implore Boss Yachimori who has offered to stand in for the substitute. Boss. We kindly beg the favor of you... to please serve as the arbitrator tomorrow. I'll take care of it. Yes. Weren't you with him and watching him? That crazy drunk can't work as arbitrator! The Day of the Succession Ceremony Unfortunately... I understand. However... When tomorrow comes, he'll have no memory of last night. Is there any way...? I see... It's impossible, isn't it? Madam, didn't you want him to fail so he'd be made to quit? I don't know why, though. Please. If not for him, then for me. No matter how much I want to do it for you, an impossibility is still an impossibility. Also my boss said I have to be on my best behavior for now. Give Boss my regards. Arbitrator Yachimori "Sunny, sunny monk boy Sunny monk boy "Send us some nice weather tomorrow "If it should..." I'm gonna do it. Come, Boss. Why does the arbitrator have to sneak in this way? - Your entrance is here. - My entrance? Wait hare, please. Madam, too. Doba Hanamura I wanna drink. No, I can't. Endure. He'll be okay, right? I'll be mixed into concrete and sunk in Tokyo Bay. Thank you for waiting so long. The succession ceremony for the 2nd generation of the Doba Family will now commence. I have to inform everyone here of a change. We had asked Mr. Karigane, the president of the Sasagohara Union, to be today's arbitrator, - but he fell ill suddenly, - Just one drink. And even though his will was strong, and he was eager to serve as arbitrator... Just a little swig... You're on. It is truly unfortunate but his replacement is... Arbitrator: Umegasaki Family's Daisaku Monden Mr. Daisaku Monden, from the 11th generation of the Umegasaki Family of Joshu, will be our arbitrator. Greetings to all. Many styles, schools, and forms of the cup-pledge ceremony have been handed down from ancient times. As in the style introduced to the Umegasaki Family, first, the sake shall be tasted once more for poison. - Quite a different style. - Sure is unusual. The sake is acceptable. How inexcusable it is to be sitting cross-legged at a sacred ceremony! According to the mediation of Mr. Hideto Sakurada, boss of the 6th generation of the Ibuki Family, the one who can transfer power is Mr. Eikichi Doba, the founder and boss of the Doba Family. The gentleman to succeed him for the 2nd generation is chain-nan of the Doba Family, Mister Toshimitsu Hanamura. And obediently sewing as arbitrator is myself: last name, Monden, first name, Daisaku, of the Umegasaki Family of Joshu. I ask the soon-to-be predecessor Mr. Doba... to accept this sake as sincere support of your successor, Toshimitsu Hanamura. I say to the founder, Eikichi Doba, I will pour this cup that is a wish from the founder to the 2nd generation for continued prosperity. Fill it to the brim, please. As you say, I will fill it to the brim. I say to the mediator, in accordance with the founder's words, the cup is filled to the brim. Please inspect it carefully. It is acceptable. To the successor-to-be, Mr. Toshimitsu Hanamura, after drinking up this cup you will assume the heavy responsibilities of the boss of the 2nd generation of the Doha Family. Please drink with that resolve and store the cup deep in your pocket. Deed of Conveyance One: Soul... One Family. One: Secret road of chivalry... One scroll. One: Prosperity fan... One pair. One: Territory... One whole. One: Hemp cloth... One roll. One: Family Flag... One flag. I duly transfer the above to you on this auspicious day in July, 1992. The seal of founder and chain-nan of the Doba Family, Eikichi Doba. The 2nd generation chain-nan of the Doba Family is Mr. Toshimitsu Hanamura. To the two of you involved, I ask you to switch seats. Now that you've switched seats, Mr. Toshimitsu Hanamura is the new head of the Doba Family! With the celebratory clap of our hands this succession ceremony is hereby concluded. Ready... Congratulations! I've seen many arbitrators, but this was my first time seeing such a spirited and passionate person like you. For an old person it was the best farewell. Thank you. Thank you. You disgraced Boss Yachimori. And Boss Sendo has lost face completely. Chop your finger off. Do it! Everything worked out okay, so no need, yeah? Are you screwing with me? Put your finger out, you! Boss! Your finger! Understand this: This isn't over. You say it's not over, meaning that I will be buried in concrete. - ...in Tokyo Bay - Repercussions. Repercussions? We're severing relations with you. You will never earn money with the yakuza again. Thank you very much. Boss and brother... Thinking about it, it has been only a few months. It was a short period that seemed long. Thank you so much for your help. I really appreciate all your kindness. Three Days Later Tripping up here started everything. It's turned out to be quite the repercussion for us. I was lucky that I could quit the yakuza without having to chop off my finger. I love you. I love you. Good bye. It's riding up again. Madam, are you driving? Return that car, please. Give Boss my regards. Take it easy on the sake. Here's a farewell gift for you. You gave him your kimono coat. Is that okay? That was the last curtain call for an old-fashioned guy like me. What can I do with such an elegant thing? Cant wear it to bed. Cant wear it around town. It's too soon for New Year's and I can't throw it away either. Give me back my finger! Wait!
