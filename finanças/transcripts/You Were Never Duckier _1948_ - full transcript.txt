Five dollars for the best duck! You mean I came all the way from Dubuque for a measly five bucks? Five thousand dollars for the best rooster? Why, they can't do this to me! (LISPING) It's unconstitutional! It's... It's... Brother, could I use 5,000 smackereenees! Hey, there must be a way! There must be! (MUTTERING) Let me see now. Let's see. Let me see. (HUMMING) Hmm. So far, so good. (DAFFY WHISTLES) I do have the darndest dreams. (SNORING) (CLUCKING) (CHUCKLING) CHICKENHAWK: And this is a Rhode Island Red! And that's a White Minorca. This is a Cochin China rooster. Gee, Pa, you sure know your chickens! Well, yes, Henery, I'm probably the finest judge of chicken flesh of any chicken hawk in this part of the country. Now, it's time for little chicken hawks to get some shut-eye! Good night. Gosh, I bet me old man would be proud of me if I was to catch him one of them big, fat, eating chickens. This looks like a good place to catch a chicken! Now, here's what I call a real chicken! Huh! I must be walking in my sleep. But how could I be walking in my sleep if I'm awake enough to know I'm walking in my sleep? The strange things people do in their sleep! Especially if they're awake! What's going on around here? (EX CLAIMING) A very small and insignificant chicken rustler. Listen, squab! Stealing just an ordinary, everyday chicken is crime enough, but to attempt to snatch a genuine pedigreed Red Island Rhode Buffordington prize rooster... Is that what you are? (LISPING) Of a certainty, small fry. What else? Jeepers, the old man will flip his lid over this one! All right, seagull! Are you coming with me quietly or do I have to slap you around some? Oh, sarsyparila! And just where are you planning to take me, super-sparrow! I'm taking you to me old man, the greatest judge of chicken flesh in the world! Yeah? Well, I don't care if he's a... He's... Chicken judge! Chicken judge, judge of chickens. Sufferin' succotash! What are we waiting for? Lead the way, sonny, to your esteemed father! Hey, by the way, what sort of cigars does he smoke? DAFFY: Hmm, quaint sort of place for a judge's domicile! Hey, Pa, look at what I brung you! Look at what I brung you! A chicken! And what a chicken! Brother! Get a load of this gorgeous plumage! Feast your eyes on this upstanding comb. And besides, I'm the only five-gaited rooster in the world! So, why not save yourself the trouble and judge me right now. (STAMMERING) Judge... Judge... What was the name? Chickenhawk! George K. Chickenhawk! Chicken hawk! Chicken hawk eats us chickens! Well, so long. I got to go. I think my Judge is burning, fudge! My fudge is burning, Judge. I mean, my mother wants me. I got to crochet a cake! (STAMMERING) Goodbye! Help. (BANGING) I distinctly said, "Help!" (HUMMING) Mr. Chickenhawk, sir, you're making a ghastly mistake! I'm an impostor, a charlatan, a fake! I'm a duck masquerading in the guise of a chicken! Look, I'll prove it! (QUACKING) That ought to convince you. (HUMMING) I know what it is. It's these appurtenances that deceive you. (CHUCKLES) Look, just part of the disguise, see? It slipped. (CHUCKLES NERVOUSLY) I didn't know you cared. (LAUGHS HYSTERICALLY) (SIGHING) The trouble you can get into just because you want 5,000 bucks. Five thousand bucks! Sufferin' succotash! I got to get back there before the judging starts! And the first prize of $5,000 for the best rooster goes to this splendid Rhode Island Red Buffordington! Congratulations! What a phony! And now, the five dollar prize for the best duck. Oh, well! Who am I to sneer at a fast fiver? Congratulations. (QUACKING) English - SDH
