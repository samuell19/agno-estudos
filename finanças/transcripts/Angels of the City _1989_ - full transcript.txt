NEWSCASTER: This is Rim Powwow Brow with the KHIT 102 News, Los Angeles. From Washington DC, we bring you good news, but some people are saying it's not so good. President Bush declares that it is his quest, as well as his desire, to put the deficit at an all time low. His projection of making us all believers is to cut back on our defense budget just enough as to allow the country breathing. President Bush says that this will buy us time and enable his administration to furnish more employment. It's still another human night in the LA city on this second Friday in July, but the cavalry may be on the way. Our weather report tells us that the slow fading 90 degrees will be met by a 60% to 70% chance of showers later on during this evening. Now, onto sports. They call him-- Get lost. You dating? How much? How you want? Plenty. $100. $100? Listen? You got the $100, we can talk. You don't, hit the road. You worth $100? Baby, what I've got for you will take you straight to heaven. And what I got, bitch, will take you straight to hell. [THEME - ROBERT TEPPER, "ANGELS OF THE CITY] THEME SONG: Angels of the city. Hey, little girl, tell me what's your name? I give you love, a diamond ring. You be my woman tonight. For candy kisses by candlelight. Hey, little girl, you belong to me. You give me money from off the street. So girl don't step out of line, because I'm the law and that's a crime. Angels of the city looking pretty. [inaudible],, you might get yourself dead. Angels of the city, [inaudible] city. It's the [inaudible] pretty. This ain't no game, baby. Look at me. I hold the key to eternity. No place to run or to hide. You've got one choice, live or die. I am the man, baby, understand. I make commands, you're in my plans. So girl, don't step out of line, because soon you'll find you're mine, you're mine. Angels of the city, you're looking pretty. You might just get dead. And so, Mr. Randall, I know you understand what you think I said, but I'm not sure you realize that what you heard is not what I meant. Oh, Mr. Cameron, now you got me all confused here. And in the words of my fellow sociologist, precisely. OK, people, for your next assignment-- [groaning] Take the weekend, and interview someone with a interesting occupation, and how said occupation relates to our lifestyles. For example, say you interview a bus driver. You will find out that he or she has a particular disdain for people. That he deals with people of a lower income bracket and they wait hours for a bus, and that he cuts people off constantly just to make the route, huh? That is not what I want to hear. I want to hear his ideas on how to improve our lives if he were in a powerful position to do so. Any questions? Miss Johnson. Well, how do we find a bus driver to interview? Ask. You'll find there are people who are just dying to be the center of attraction. Mr. Calvin, feels like someone else we know, huh? Stop it. Can we ask anybody? Like a a gangster? Gangster? What a bonehead. A gangster? Sure, by all means. Just, please, be careful. Ah, the ever effervescent Mr. Randall. Thanks, Mr. C. Can you give us some examples of whom to interview? Whom? No. Be creative and don't, don't, come in here with some made up person, because I'll know. Believe me, I'll know. Have a good weekend. We always do something on Friday night. Oh, I'm sorry, something came up. Came up? What are you talking about? - What? Oh, I get it. You guys got some kind of special interviews to do tonight? No, we have other plans. What's going on? Can't tell you. [interposing voices] Oh, does she have you wrapped? Wienies. - I'll call you tonight. - OK. Bye. - Bye. Bye. I think they have a double date tonight. You're sick, man, you know that? Those girls, they love us. Hey, I'm not saying anything about Cathy, but can I ask you something? Shoot. When you and Cathy are, you know, fucking, do you guys do it for hours? Oh, yeah. Nick can do it all night and all day and still want it. Yeah, so? And what I don't understand is how they can do without it for days at a time. Man, I don't know what you're getting at, but I do know at 11 o'clock tonight, those girls are going to be back in their dorm rooms sleeping like angels. I'm going to let you buy me a beer. Well, I appreciate that. Big of you. I know it. Yahoo, that's some lucky bullshit. Ivy league, junior. That's what I call a real sweet shot. Thanks, man. What say we make the game a little more interesting? What'd you have in mind? $5 a game. Rack? Whoa, Mick, check it out. I'd like to interview her. I bet you would. Go call the girls, man. Just called them. They're not at home. Damn. MICK: Rich, come here. Oh, baby. Did you see that? She just gave that guy money. RICHIE: That's her pimp, man. MICK: He doesn't look like a pimp. She's absolutely beautiful. She's a whore. I bet you she'd be a good subject to write about, huh? From a small town in New York. It's called Erno. I was always too big for my age. Didn't really fit in with the other kids. My mom took out when we were three. My dad had to raise us alone. He raped me when I was 10. So when I was 16, I met this drug dealer. He used to beat me a lot. I had a couple abortions. I needed a job, you know, so I became a waitress, and then I got a job at Kmart. Now, I'm a hooker. Did you like working at Kmart? What are you laughing at? She's pulling your leg, man. You mean, it's not true? No, I never worked at Kmart. Come on, baby, get the credit. Come on. Come on, baby. Yeah. Come on, baby. Come on, do it for Carmen. Me. Come on. What's the matter, Mick? I stretch her out too much for ya? Fuck you, dude. No, fuck me, Mick. Come on. Come on, baby, do it for Carmen. That was good, school boy. I'll go get washed up. Well, man, took you long enough. Oh, too much booze. Hey, how much for another go? $200 or I could call a friend. Four's a party. Hey, I like the sound of that. What do you say, Richie? Yeah, Richie, what do you say? Not tonight, sweetheart. Come on, what's the matter. I never had two chicks before. Oh, come on, I never had two chicks before. It is every man's fantasy. Sorry, dude. The only fantasy [inaudible] I have tonight is cram for an exam. Yeah, Mick, what about You Sorry, he's the one with the money. I'm really nervous. This is a bunch of shit. Silence. We shall have no disturbances during the ceremonial rite. You will now bow your heads in respect. I am the high priestess, Sister Stephanie. So alas your night has come. You have chosen Tri Delta to be your sorority, and now, it's time for you to show your trust and loyalty. I hate this bitch already. Don't get me in trouble. In these boxes before me lay the ceremonial garments that you are to wear while performing your initiation rite. They have been blessed in the name of Tri Delta. Tonight, you may be granted the privilege of becoming sisters of Tri Delta. Tonight, you will be given the opportunity to prove yourself worthy of this sanctuary. Katherine and Wendy, sisters, you shall dress for the evening as prostitutes. You shall then pick up your John and proceeds to collect $100 for your trick. Are we supposed to sleep with them? That will be your choice. Looking good. Stunning. Perfect. Oh, come on. It's going to be fun. Lighten up. Kathy? Yeah. I don't want anybody to see us like this, or dressed in these clothes. Don't tell me you're changing your mind. I just don't want anybody to see us like this. Don't worry about it. We'll park down by the side exit. No one even ever goes out that way. We'll park down in the parking lot, but down by the boulevard. We'll be all right. I still don't like it. You know, there's a lot of weird people on the block at night. Kathy? Yeah? I'm scared. Of what? I mean, what if we get picked up? That's the whole idea. No, I mean, what if we really get picked up? I don't want to do it with a complete stranger. Don't be silly. Well, you know, Mick thinks the deepest, darkest secret a woman has is a desire to be a whore. Well, Mick, is an asshole. Come on, let's go. I don't know. Cheap bastard. Hello, Carmen, how's tricks? You know, you made a lot more money with me, Carmen. What are you doing here? I just want to see how my best girl is doing. How are ya? Answer me! I'm fine. I'm OK. I just want to know if Gold treats you better than me? He treats me OK. What do you need me to do, A? Gold killed my best girl. I'll come back to you, A. It'll be like before but better. Will you? Yes. I don't think so. They're still not home. Maybe they're just not answering their phone? Shit. I must have dropped my wallet, man, back at that hotel. Come on, man, let's go. I'm not going anywhere. Oh, come on, man, let's go. You got no money in it. I got my father's credit cards in there. And if he gets some bill from Frederick's of Hollywood, I'm in deep shit. I'm going. That's what I'm doing. Go. Can I borrow $50? What for? If I'm going, I might as well get laid. (SINGING) Everything is beautiful in it's own way. And if I ever had it to give, it's beautiful-- Hey. Two pretty [inaudible]. (SINGING) I got the wine if you've got the time. I'm talking to you. Shit, I'm looking for some easy pussy tonight. You'll look like you might be down. I'm talking to you. What's wrong? Too cute to talk to me or something? Huh? Huh? Shit, you all need your asses kicked. Teach you some respect around here. Think your shit don't stink. Hey, faggot, why don't you leave them alone? Your dick's about the size of a thimble anyhow, so get lost. Go on, beat it. You got a cigarette? WENDY: Sure. What's your name? Marie. Thanks a lot. Yeah, thanks. It is written that all man of power shall stick together and live forever. Everything will happen according to our plans, gentlemen. And remember, you are in good hands with Gold. Devaris, show our guests the door, please? Have a pleasant evening, my friends. Money makes the world go around, Devaris, and with this, the world is mine. Our take is about $10,000 short this month. I don't trust these Chinese bastards. I think they sell us this shit, so they can move it on our distributors. No, we don't have to worry about them. They're OK. Then, we better find out who is moving in on our affairs. I already know. Who? Lee. But he's no bother. He's a boy playing in a man's game, and his time is almost over. We've also been getting pressure from the cops. Some of them want bigger payoffs, the others special favors. We've really got to talk about this Gold. Later. Later. Let me change my clothes, wash my face, have a drink, then we'll finish business. Kapeesh? Kapeesh Gina, fix me a drink, baby. What would you like, baby? What I always drink. Get the damn drink. Gold has been running his turf for an awful long time. It ain't going to be all that easy just to move him out. Bullshit. How long do you think it will be before we're controlling the whole southeast area? You see, Dylan, your problem is you worry too much, and you ask too many questions. And I got the answers. Hollywood Boulevard, I won it. Gold doesn't know yet, but tonight, he's a dead motherfucker. I've got a big deal going down with a prominent San Francisco banker for some big bucks, probably more money than either of us has ever seen in our whole lives. And with that, I'm the man. Are you waiting for Christmas or something? The money. $200? It'll be better tomorrow night, baby. I want $500 tonight. OK, Lee, OK, but I-- I don't want no backtalk, bitch. I just want my money. You understand? Money. - I understand. I understand. Sorry. You should be. OK. Thanks a lot. Mr. Gold? Mr. Gold? What? The police, they just found Carmen in a hotel. She's dead. Son of a bitch. What do you want to do? I want you to talk to that shitbag Lee, arrange a meeting. He won't come. Put the word out. Get all my girls off the streets, and grab a couple of his. He'll talk to me then. As you say, Mr. Gold. Hey, pretty girl, what you doing? What-- you-- My ladies. So who are you two? Excuse me? You working for Lee? I beg your pardon? What are you doing on this corner, Miss Girlfriend? Oh, I'm Katherine Foy and this is Wendy Johnson. We're not going to take anything away from you or anything. You see, we're joining this sorority, and this is our initiation, but we don't have to sleep with anyone or anything. It's college rules. Yeah, college rules. But what's your name? Oh, Roxy. What's it to you? Oh, here's something for your corner. $10? OK, college girls, you can be prostitutes for the night, just stay over there and have fun. You want to go for it? Oh, no. But thanks anyways. You go ahead. You ready, homeboy? [inaudible] All right. I don't like this. [honking] Hey, girls, you want to party? Come on, let's go talk to him. No. NERD: Hey, girls, you want to party? I don't like this. Excuse me, sir. Come on, he doesn't look so bad. WENDY: Let's just back and tell Stephanie we did it. No. You know she'll catch us in a lie. Well, come on, let's go. Well, my friend really doesn't feel up to it tonight, but thanks anyways. Carmen, it's me, Mick. I left my wallet in there. Where is it? DETECTIVE CHANCE: Looking for this? Yeah. Hey. I'm Detective John Chance. Now, I didn't mean to scare you. But I figured whoever killed the whore might come back looking for is wallet. Killed? Carmen? I didn't kill her. - No? - No! Convince me. I swear to you. Who was here? Were you here alone, huh? Yes. You're lying to me Mick Randall. Don't lie to me, man. It makes me very angry. It makes me think that you think I'm an idiot. You're in deep shit. Now, you tell me everything that happened here. I was with a friend. We picked her up at a bar, and we came here. - You own any firearms? - What? Smart guns, pistols, automatic weapons. You own anything like that, huh? - No. - Where you from? - Maryland. Maryland, oh, nice country. Ever go hunting there with your daddy? No. Yeah. What did you hunt? Geese, ducks, and rabbits. Carmen was shot through the head, blew the back of her head off. Tell me what kind of gun was used to kill her. I'm gonna be sick. Uh-huh. Yeah, OK. Yeah, I'll tell him. They've picked up a couple of workers. They want to talk. Want to meet. This is it. Get the men ready. It's showdown time. So good of you to come on such short notice, Mr. Lee. I see your threads have improved. Yeah, well, I dressed just for you. Now what do you want to talk about, Mr. Gold? I want you to get off my turf. You killed Jazzy. She was my best worker. You killed Tiffany. So that makes us even. We keep killing off each other's girls, we don't make money. the Understand? You understand. You want me out of the southeast area, well, it's going to cost ya $50,000. Bullshit. Do we have a deal?

Who are you? Detective Chance. Sit down. I have a few questions I want to ask you, and I want you to keep your mouth shut at all times. What's this all about? The prostitute you picked up earlier this evening, Carmen, she was murdered. OK. I want you to start from this afternoon. I want to know everything, every hour on the hour, until now. Go. I hope we lost him. God, I hope so. Do you think that was them? Yeah, I think that was them. We gotta get out of here. - I think you're right. - Let's go. KATHY: Do you know where we are? WENDY: I think East LA. We need to find a phone. KATHY: We will. Come on, let's keep going. You got a cigarette? Sure. Have another one? Sorry, all out. Who do you girls work for? Nobody. You want a pimp? No. But I'd settle for a phone. What's your names? I'm Wendy. This is Katherine. I'm Carlos. You girls lost? Our car broke down about three blocks away. What kind of car? A Rolls. You drive a Rolls? Please, can you get us to a phone? OK, walk this way. You girls make a lot of money, right? Look, we're not hookers. No? No. Sure do look like hookers to me. Well, we're not. We go to college. No shit? No shit. I never made it with a college girl. How old are you? 15. You shouldn't be talking about sex and money all the time. What else is there to talk about? Wait a minute. We're going back the same way we came. Are you sure there's telephones in there? Don't worry. Be chill. Just follow me. Well, well, well, Carlos, what have you got here? I found them wandering around our turf. She drives a Rolls. A Rolls Royce? Yep. Let's see what you got. Hey, I think I'm rich. Well, can I at least have a quarter for a telephone call please? She want a quarter. Sure, why not? Get the hell out of here. Wait, but-- but, wait a minute. Wait a minute. Don't we get to fuck them first? [sirens] Assholes! Let's get them. I'm gonna kill those bitches. - Thanks a lot. - Thanks. Bye bye. Come on, Wendy, we have to hurry up. These heels are killing me. God, why'd you have to call that guy an asshole? Because he was an asshole. Anyway, we got away, didn't we? Yeah, just barely. - Barely is good enough for me. - What are you doing? Come on, we got to get out of here. We will, I just want to rest my feet a second. What a wonderful time we're having. Don't rub it in, OK? Let's join the Tri Delta sorority, Wendy. It's so much fun. It's the in thing to do, Wendy. Come on, we'll have a great time. I get the point. Kathy, lighten up. I was just teasing. God, I wish this whole night was one big tease. I mean, what a nightmare. Why don't we just go out with Mick and Richie like we always do? I tell you, I don't know. You want to hear something funny? Mick asked me to marry him last week. Can you believe that? I really care about that guy. I do. He is so funny. But marriage, jeez. Then why did you say I should move in with Richie, huh? OK, OK, so sue me. It's just that you never know what your future is going to be like until it's right there slapped in front of your face. I don't even know what I want to do 5 or 10 years from now. But I do know one thing, I've got to know who I am before I make any hard choices about my life. Yep, that's me. So what do you think, kiddo? I think we'd better get out of here. Yeah, you're right. Let's go. Hi. You ladies thirsty? It's cheap, but oh so delicious. Oh, we're lost and we're looking for a telephone. Oh, kind of hard to find one them in this neck of the woods. Hey, watch you all dressed like that for? Coming from a costume party or something? It's a long story. Well, I got time. They call me Mojo. Oh, I'm Katherine. I'm Wendy. So you all lost, huh? Well, I believe you might be able to find a phone in that all night joint up there. Three blocks up and around the corner. You all ain't never been in this part of town before, have ya? No. You gotta be careful around these parts. I mean, there's a lot of dangerous people around here. But don't let that scare ya none, just get them before they get you. I mean, kick ass first, and then take names. Yeah. How did you end up here? Me? Well, that's my long story. I used to be a boxer. Yeah, ranked number five in the world, and then the army drafted me, and the war came. They treated me pretty good. Yeah. Finally came home, I think it was 1947. I broke a rednecks are for calling me a nigger in Atlanta, Georgia. Broke his arm in two. Yeah. And then, well, I went to jail, did a 10 spot on that chain gang. Life's a bitch, and then you die. Nobody ever said it was supposed to be easy. Me or anybody. Hey, hey, what you all girls do? Oh, we go to college. That's nice. Well, y'all better get out of here and get to that phone because it's a lot of people around here that they ain't got but one thing on their mind. You know what I mean? Yeah, y'all better get to that phone now. Thanks a lot. Yeah. Bye. Yeah. OK. God bless you now. God bless you. Excuse us? Do you think maybe we can use a telephone? You want to come in, I need the password. Password? Password. Hey, look, we've really been through an ordeal tonight. We just need to use the telephone. No password, no in. I don't believe this. Well, do you think maybe we can talk to the manager? I need the password. Hey, look, we really need to use the phone. Are you going to let us in or not? Password. Password? Password. Oh, fuck. Why didn't you just say that in the first place? I gotta pee, OK? I'm going to find a bathroom. All right. Excuse me, do you have a telephone? Excuse me, do you have a telephone? No. You don't have a telephone? Well, can you tell me where one is? One what? Telephone. We don't have one. I know you don't have one. Can you tell me where one is? Grocery store, six blocks. Which way? That way. Want a drink? Do I want a drink? Can I have a glass of water, please? Thank you. WENDY: Kathy. Kathy? Kathy, this is David. I asked him if he'd take us to a phone. He said he'd drive us home. - You have a car? - Yes. Great, let's go. In a while. I owe this joint. We close in an hour. You hungry? This dump makes the best chicken in the world. We don't have any money. My treat. No, thank you, but we'll settle for a drink. Walk this way. So we drove down this dead end, got out, and we started running. They were going to kill us. All this mess because we wanted to join a stupid sorority. Well, at least one thing came out right tonight. What's that? I'm glad I ran into you. Me too. Was his name Gold? That's what they called him. Let's get out of here. Take this. - I don't know how to use it. You don't have to. Just keep it. Sit here and don't say a word. I'm sorry, gentlemen, but we were just about to close for the night. All right. Mr. Gold? Get down. On the floor. Drop it. My buddy you just wasted. You're a dead bitch. Give me your car keys. Give them the keys. Give them the keys. Look out the window and see if you can see a sign. I can't make it out. It's too dark. Anderson. It says Anderson. Well, am I supposed to keep going straight? I don't know. Is he dead? No, I don't think so. We gotta take him to a hospital. Help me. Let's get him-- help me. [gunshot] Come on, baby. Come on. Come on. Open the door up, bitch. Open it up. Come on. Open the door. Open it. Open it. Come on, bitch. You're dead, bitch. Leave us alone. Shoot him. You don't want to shoot me. Shoot him. Take it easy. What do you want from us? We didn't do anything. Come on, sweetheart. A friend of mine told me that she wouldn't bring a child into this horrible world. Now, I thought about it for a long time, how bad is this world? When I compared it to the beginning of time, I realized that evil of mankind has existed with us from the beginning. What's haunted me though for many sleepless nights is what is it going to be like at the turn of the century? And the answer to that is an optimistic one if you listen to Maria Whitehouse. Marie is a 16-year-old who quit high school to get a job in a paper mill so she could help her divorced mother and her nine-year-old brother, Jimmy. Her mother, who brought home a date named Wayne, beat her repeatedly and raped Marie. Her mother always made up with Wayne though, and when Marie asked why. Her mother replied that it's normal for a man to slap his woman once in a while. When Marie told me that her mother married this man, she ran away from home and moved to LA. She lived on the streets and worked in a pizza place. Her boyfriend beats her up once in a while, but she won't end up like her mother. Marie's a heroin addict and she's hooking for a living. And her pimp tells her that as soon as she makes enough money that he'll buy her a restaurant. Marie works very hard for him, and she takes all the S and M tricks. I asked why the sadomasochism? And she replied that it pays a lot more money and she likes the special attention she gets from her boyfriend when he tends to her cuts and bruises. And that's it. Class dismissed. Kathy, that was wonderful. Can we keep up with Marie for this term project? Yeah. Why didn't you write about your own tragedy? I don't know. When I listen to other people's stories, it makes me feel like I'm not alone. Can I-- can I ask you a very private question that you don't have to answer if you don't want to? How does this affect your relationship with Richard or with any man? It's in my next report. I can't wait. I've been sleeping a lot lately. First time in a while. I talked to Dr. Marini, and he tells me you're coming along just fine. Oh, and I wrote to your parents. Your parents are coming to visit this weekend. They've been kind of busy, you know? Your sister had another baby. A baby girl. I don't think that her husband is going to quit until they get that boy. I see Mick sometimes. He's doing pretty good. He's been working out. And Richie, I don't know, he gets mad at me a lot. I try to make him understand that I just need time. Time to-- well, you know. Wendy, you're my best friend, and I miss you. I really miss you. To a very brave and beautiful lady. The police want to see me again tomorrow. What for? I'm not sure. When is this going to end? Haven't you been through enough? Why didn't you tell me you slept with that prostitute Carmen? Who said I did? KATHY: I found out. I didn't. Well, it doesn't matter. I just want to know why. Mick told you. Son-of-a-bitch. Mick didn't tell me. Detective Chance did. Now, how would he Know I want to hear it from you. I thought you were sleeping around that night. We had a couple of drinks, we just did it. Why'd you pay for it? Why didn't you do it with any girl, a girl at a disco, or at the dorms? I don't know. She was just there. KATHY: She was just there? Like I said, we had a couple of drinks. Yeah, I know. You had one too many drinks, and she was just there. You make it sound so awful. It is, Richie, believe me. It is. GOLD: Devaris, get Banoni on the phone, and you tell him, we won't take a penny less than $30,000. Got it? As you say Mr. Gold. I'm gonna take a shower. and the bitch, what's her name? Katherine Foy. GOLD: Yeah, her. She lives in an apartment alone, right? And she's got a cop for a bodyguard. A cop? A cop? Do I know him? No. It don't matter. We get her tonight. No matter what, we get her tonight. That pretty sweet thing is mine tonight. Miss Foy, please away from the window. Oh, I'm sorry. Just try to relax. You just move in? Yeah, about two weeks ago. I haven't had time to settle down yet. And you call me Kathy. Kathy. You into deep sea diving or something? Oh, that, it belongs to Richie. Richie? My boyfriend. That man, Gold, what do you think he's going to do? Gold is out on bail. It was set at $500,000, and he came up with it. So you do think he'll come after me? It's hard to say. The judge warned him if he came near you, he'd throw him back in jail forever, and I'll be with you morning, noon, and night until the trial. Well, what about school? Are you going to follow me there? Wherever you go, I go. Those are my orders. Well, I hope you like English Lit. I have a two hour lecture at 8:00. I'm sorry, but you can't be out past sundown. What? It's for your own protection, and I hate babysitting. But those are your orders. Exactly. Can I help you unpack? Sure. You give me one excuse after another. I'm not giving you an excuse. I'm not going to do it with someone else in the apartment. Tell him to leave. No. RICH: With me. I can protect you. What? You think as soon as he leaves? I can just get in the mood just like that? I can't wine and dine you because he won't let me. Besides, we used to do it in the dorm room with Wendy in the next damn bed. Well, I don't want to do it, all right? You don't want to do it? Or you don't want to do with me? Are you sleeping with that cop out there? I don't want to talk about, OK? Why? Because you're a spoiled, immature little kid, who can't take no for an answer. Kathy, if I walk out this door, you're never going to see me again. I mean it. Are you leaving? Fuck you, pig. Sorry I caused you all this trouble. No, you're not. You're right, I'm not.
