Marcus Wright, Marcus Wright, you're next. - Marcus Wright. - Marcus, okay, right over here. Please be ready when we call you. We're moving very, very fast, and we do not have time to wait for you. Trust me, Lars von Trier wouldn't put up with this shit. Come on, really, did she just - talk to me like that? - Bitch. Okay, why do you think you should be cast as Solitary Confinement? Is it bad to say that I could really use the money? The other game shows, you know, they ask you a lot of questions. I was never really any good at that. What does the idea of solitary confinement mean to you? Total lack of control over your surroundings, and dictating what you do and how you do it, giving that control over to someone else. It means to strip away all illusions and to be alone and, therefore, to face yourself. Why will an audience want to watch you on this show? Look at me. I will charm them with my wit, my intelligence, my incredible ability to sing. I think I'll be able to maintain my composure the best, probably be a relief. I mean look at me. I like me. You like me too. You ain't gonna tell me you like me, but you like me. I will try to make fun jokes and puns, keep things light and be a shining example of overcoming obstacles. I will try. Uh, what is the most interesting thing about you? Give a fuck about anything, I don't care. Is that I am a single mother to two young cats and one old one. My ability to focus, you know, like really zone in. I'm a female helicopter pilot, and a badass pilot at that. My cock. Is that, does that offend you? Well it should. This is reality and that's what you want. So my answer is my cock. What is your strategy for winning the show? Take care of myself, imagine stuff. I'm gonna take a systematic approach with a test that tests my vision, my sight, all my senses. Focus, you know, Shiva would go out into the forest in Samadhi for like weeks at a time. That's gonna be my strategy. I don't think I really need a strategy. Do the things that I normally do, um, but without any communication. I will win the show by just talking, talking, talking. What are you most afraid of? Probably being alone, but if there's an audience, are you really alone? Of something happening to my cat David. He's my special boy, and also of dying alone. Losin'. I'm not afraid of anything. I work in reality TV. I'm not afraid of nothin'. Try me. Stillness and quiet, so that's gonna be interesting. Drowning. And what would you do with the million dollar prize if you win? Well, I would buy more snow globes. I would, um, get my cats a better flea medicine and more furniture. For starters, I know that the, um, one million is probably more than those things. First of all, I'm gonna tell everyone I told you so. Then I'm gonna get a sports car. I'm gonna move to Miami. Then I'm gonna tell everyone to eat a dick. My wife, uh, she needs two operations, therapy and medication, and business has been slow, so the money hasn't been there to keep up with the health insurance. I would do the smart thing and I would put a down payment on a house and invest it. I know that might not be as interesting as like buying a pink corvette or something, but I'm also not an idiot. Can you do me a favor and quit reading from your script? Just answer the damn question. You know what? I come in here and I've been disrespected the whole time. You sit behind your little prefabricated table, livin' your prefabricated lives, sayin' someone else's lines. You're a fucking cunt. But all the while, you sit there danglin' your carrot. Jump, rabbit, jump. I'm not your rabbit. I'm sorry. This isn't at all what I thought it was. I'll see myself out. - My God. - Wow. If I call your name, please exit this door into the casting room. If I do not call your name, please stay here and do not leave. We have Marcus Wright. - I mean, - Fuck. They're gonna come back for us, - obviously. - They better. We're like the best thing - to happen. - I'm thirsty, hungry, and I have to pee. I've been here fore like five hours. I wonder if like they'll give us - a massage when we go back. - Fire my chump agent. You think? Excuse me. Geez, whoa. Congratulations to you all, you've made it to the final round. The producer's assistant will be in momentarily to explain the next step in the process. Until then we do understand that you're very excited, please do not share this information with anyone at this time. Thank you. Gosh, what an attitude. We're gonna win a million fucking dollars! Aren't you excited? I'm fucking excited! Man! - Oh my God. - Oh! - My God. - College debt go away. All right. Hey everyone. Oh, hey. Let's start with a round of applause for all of you. You've earned a spot in the first ever 24 hour live feed reality web series with a grand prize of $1 million. That means one of you in this room is going to be a millionaire. That's awesome. Yay. Now, I have to go over a few details, and then I have some extra special news to share with you. But first your schedule. You're gonna have a medical exam, just to make sure you're all physically fit to enter the competition. Then we'll have interviews. This will be a chance for you to show the audience how you really feel. This is your 15 minutes of fame. Afterwards, we're going to have a brief meeting with a producer of the show. You're not going to see the solitary confinement area before you enter it for the competition, but the producer will tell you a little bit about it. Then you'll go to a green room and wait until you're notified that it's time to enter solitary confinement. Yes! I don't know if I should be happy or scared. Now for that extra special news. The show has just been picked up for a second season. - What? - Oh my, wow. We haven't even announced the cast, and we already know we're a hit. So as a reward to you, the winner will now receive $2 million. Yes, yes, oh my God. Congratulations and welcome again to solitary confinement. Contestant: All right, yeah! Enjoy your stay. Right back at ya. - She's so hospitable. - What, - what? - Wait, we're not going home? - That shit's tonight. - Oh. - That shit's tonight. - Oh my goodness. - Wow. - Okay. - Tonight? - Excuse me, - did you talk to my agent? - I got this. Tonight, I gotta put my dog out. - Okay. - My God, - what am I gonna do? - You mean, we're really not - going home? - We didn't sign anymore - paperwork. - Okay. - Maybe that's the next step. - I still got this. - I still got this. - Yeah, maybe, - hopefully. - Yeah, but, hey, at least - it's two million now, right? - Oh, yeah, yeah. - I mean, that's true. - Double the money. I love it, I love it! All right. I'm sorry where should I, just look here? Either at the camera, or you can look at me if you like. All right, I'm Marcus Wright, Los Angeles, yoga enthusiast, instructor, do a lot of carpentry, basically kind of a handyman, not tied down to one schedule. Really when it comes down to it, it's to get rid of debt. If I can get myself locked up and win $2 million, $2 million. It'd be like a new day, a new life. I was being pressured from my parents and therapist, to be honest, just kind of a last resort. Kind of to appease them, I thought doing something extreme and completely out of my comfort zone might be the best solution, might be peaceful. You know, walking around every second of the day, always feeling just like a constant sadness, like a really, really heavy heart, I don't know, I just, it seems insane in itself to take this step, but why not? I'm 26 years old, and I'm a pharmacist, pharmacy technician, either, really doesn't matter. You have to live a fairly regimented lifestyle, because sometimes your hours flip, and I tend to live a more regimented lifestyle than others. Friends and my coworkers all call me Mr. Robot for fun because I'm always on time. Never late, never early, just always on time. And I think that having that regimented lifestyle is gonna help me quite a bit. I'm Korean-American, parents are immigrants from, of course, the motherland of South Korea, not North Korea, South Korea. I work as a social media manager for a startup company. Social media is something I just love doing. If I had a weakness, it would be in that regard, like, you know, social media's all about chatter and being caught up in the world, and I personally like to be caught up in the world, because I like to think that I'm pretty knowledgeable in these kind of things. When I just have quiet and stillness and I can't look at my phone and everything, that's when I get a little antsy, that's when I get a little jumpy, and I'm not sure what to do with myself. I would say that every time I'm in a quiet and/or intimate situation with my significant other or my good friends or just whoever, my first instinct is to look at my phone. You know, I think in recent years I've found it harder and harder to wrap my head around getting older. So it's a challenge like this, it's good timing, it's good timing. I need this, because I want to challenge myself. That's what I've been doing my entire life, and it's not that I don't wanna lose my youth. I'm just not ready to be an old man. So you said you prepped for it. What have you, uh, how have you been prepping? I actually started sleeping on my floor. Um, 'cause my bed is really comfortable at home. It's really comfortable. Megan, I love you so much. This is for you. I hope that, uh, I hope I can win for you and you can live as many years as you want and play as many games as you want. I'm looking forward to the, to the, uh, confinement. It's going to be quite a test of my will. I see that there are some strong competitors here. This should make for an interesting competition. Uh, what else about me? Um, I'm very outdoorsy. My husband and I got married two years ago, and it's been really good. No kids, no kids yet, so no pressure. Um, yeah, um, gosh. My husband, um, just lost his job, and he's real upset about it, and that's sort of how I came upon here. I figured it'd be really nice to be able to be sole breadwinner for a little while, maybe he can go back to school and, you know, pursue his dream career. It'd be really awesome. See at one time I had everything. I was a professional athlete, playin' football. Ended up screwin' that up a little bit. Got thrown in jail, some things happened there, but, uh, I'm out now. I pretty much don't have anything, and I wanna have something, and I wanna succeed at something, and I want people to look at me differently. Sure, I know I made some mistakes. Come in. Here's the doctor's files. I'm Hillard May, the creator and producer of Solitary Confinement. Welcome, cast. Now, I want to congratulate you on making it to the show. I can tell you that we feel that you are the most able candidates there is. You guys are gonna be great. Now, I know you have questions, but here's all the information you're gonna receive. First, at some point tonight you will be taken and brought to a bathroom where you will be given the clothes you're allowed to wear. You will not have shoes. We have to consider your safety, so you will not have anything with you with which you could harm yourself. Once in your cell, you will have a camera in the corner, and when you are ready to come out, you simply look toward the camera, cross your arms above your head in an X, and just yell, I quit. Within a few minutes, you'll be released. Now while inside you will be filmed 24/7 and broadcast over the internet, so everything you do and say will be seen. You will not be freed unless you quit. Food will be delivered once a day. It'll be enough food for the entire day. Now the whole idea of this show is to test your will to go on. When the last contestant remains, we will free that person and they will win $2 million and the fame that winning the first season of Solitary Confinement brings. - Nice. - Wow. - Good luck. - Awesome. Thank you. I don't know, I should probably be home in a couple of hours, but it's taking a really, really long time. You should see this casting director, she's a total bitch. And like these girls and these guys, I don't even know where they found these people from. I swear they're, I don't know, they're not from here. Hold on, give me a second. I would really like a cafe mocha. No whip, skim, anyone? It's showtime. Jesus, what are meathead one - and meathead two? - Yeah. What is your problem? You're comin' with me. What the fuck?

And you too, bitch, cunt, all day being a fucking asshole, and then you're gonna watch these fucking guys watch me get naked. No, don't you fucking say anything, bitch. Hope the $12 an hour is worth it, dumbass. - Yeah. - Hey, I'm just doing my job. Okay? - Take her clothes. - Okay. So I just have to stand here and shower? You know what, fuck you, I don't even fucking care. It's a pair of boobs and an ass. Oh, hello. - Two. - You are gorgeous. Hi, oh, isn't this a nice little perk.

Two million, two million. Two fuckin' million dollars. That's the only reason why I'm doin' this. Towel, lotion? We don't have a towel - for you. - Perfume? Nothin'. I'll use your shirt. I'll dry you. Um, what is this? You've got to be kidding me, right? Put 'em on. You expect me to wear this on national television? Have you seen this? It's hardly my color. I think it suits you perfectly. Wants a towel. I want lotion more than a towel. Now what? Bring him his clothes. Thank you, darlin'. You enjoy the show? I need a towel. Really? What is this? Wow, wow, why don't you hold that for me, okay? Sorry to cover up for ya. I know you wanted to look as long as you could, but it is what it is. Do I get a towel? No, ma'am. Hand me clothes. There you go. I can dry you if you want. This is ridiculous. Yeah. Cold as can be. You can at least give a man some hot water. Hello, beautiful. - Hello. - Bring me his clothes. Hello, gorgeous. What, no towel? What you gonna do with it, put it around your head? You look like a towel head. Get dressed. Funny, man. This guy. You the funny man. What now? Clothes, awesome.

Fuck you guys, seriously. You done? Yeah. Oh, what the fuck, again, motherfuckers? Oh fuck. Fuck. What the, where's the door? How the fuck did you guys get me in here? Jesus Christ, you guys are taking a lot more effort than I thought. Well, that's great, you didn't get my fuckin' glasses. 10, 11, 12, 13. 13. That's a bucket. A bucket? I think I'm afraid to open this box. Lovely. Do you push me through this little-ass hole or what? No shit. Fuckin', that's on? That's on. Hello there. Yeah. Oh shit. The thing is is that you guys don't know who you're fuckin' with. See, I told you, told you before, I've done all this type of shit, well, maybe not quite like this, but, uh, yeah, I was in the joint. And you know what? I got out. Oh my God. All right. I read somewhere routine is ideal and try not to sleep, but how the fuck does one keep themselves busy in a fucking room with nothing in it? You you didn't give us toilet paper, and then you don't give us utensils or a sink. That's foul. Women are just inherently more intelligent and just better sense of things. Yes, we always like to blame that they have emotional mood swings and PMS and blame it all on that, but, no, men are just equally capable of being pretty dumbasses as well. Hi, I'm 84, and I'm gonna frickin' win this thing and get a million dollars. I can do this fuckin' room. I'm gonna redecorate. Ready? Set. Done. I've got my kitchen over here. Got the bedroom, got the bathroom slash fuckin' area where I hang out, and then I got the man cave over here, and it's, uh, it's gonna be good. I'm kind of a well rounded guy, you know, like musically and shit, you know. Like, I like, uh, I like all kinds of shit, man. I like country music, too. A lot of people don't know that about me and shit, you know. I like some country music, shit. We can do this, piece of cake. Two million. I bet you can't see that now.

So it was really cute and all how you were, you know, not talking to me and being all part of the show, but it's kinda getting old really quickly. Come on, you can talk to me and just edit it out.

I don't mean to be a diva, but I'm just wondering if I could get like some different food or like some medicine or something. Uh, I'm not exactly sure what's a matter. It could be the smell of the bucket that's making me sick or some of the leftover food in there. Actually, I'm pretty fucking sure, sure it's those things. What the fuck! What?

Did you know that in 1776 when the founding fathers of America were drafting the Declaration of Independence, a man sat at his desk in Konigsberg, Germany and drafted a philosophical work which was the diametric opposite of the philosophical premises upon which the Declaration of Independence of the United States was based. That man's name was Immanuel Kant, K-A-N-T. But, I think a more appropriate name would've been Immanuel Cunt, because that indeed he was. Fuck you, fuck you! Fuck you! Fuck you!

This, that didn't mean anything, did it? It's not a game. Go away, you can just. Hello! Jesus fucking Christ. I would take my time here to share with you my views on these things. The United States was based upon the freedom of the individual, whereas communism and socialism, dictatorships, some dictatorships, if you like, are based upon collectivism, which is basically, decisions are made for the benefit of the greater good without regard to the individual. And if you explore where that has led, the communist new upon the founding of the USSR that they would never make it. They will achieve technical efficiency, but never economic efficiency or success.

I mean, you always notice that the movies, there's always like, you know, there's always the girlfriend who has like the really stupid or douchey or evil boyfriend, and she's like, ah, I'm too dumb to, you know, to just break up with him, you know, thinking, you know, she can't do it until like the ugly ass, mediocre looking hero has to come and be like, oh, I'll save the day, but then the girl is like, no, I just wanna friend zone you and then the movie progresses, and then at some point the guy somehow convinces the girl that, you know, she's like amazing and like she finally dumps the guy, the evil, douchey boyfriend, and then they finally. I just wanna live my life, be a happy person and normal and fuck it and be around people. After this, I'm gonna be around fuckin' people. It's better than this. Anything, anything is better than this. I can't, you gotta let me go. How long have I been here? You gotta let me out. I gave up. I gave up. You're killing me! I gave, I gave up. God, I want you here right now. I want you with me so bad, just tell me what to do, just tell me what to fucking do, just tell me what to do. I don't wanna make this decision for you by myself. Oh my God, oh my God, oh my God. Watching right now, watching this, like do you agree? Like, just, I mean, I can't see if you agree or disagree. Thumbs up, thumbs down, just like, what do you think about that? I mean, this is a very concerning topic. You know, we always see the same old shit. Or, or better yet, you know, it's always like one guy and like seven women and each of 'em are fucked up, like fuck, there's the hooker with a heart of gold, the psychotic ex-girlfriend, or some, some shit like that. I mean, like, it's just, it's just old and boring, and you know there always has to be like this cheesy romance thing. I just, I can't, I hate it, I can't do this. I just, I fucking can't do this. This is too fucking much. I did not sign up for this, lack of fucking food and fucking, I can't, I can't do it. This is fucking bullshit, it's fuckin' bullshit. You guys are gonna fucking starve me to death. Okay, God, fuck it. No, no, no, no, no, no, no, a million dollars is not worth it. It's not fucking worth it. Come, come get me out.

Um, I'm sorry I'm probably overreacting, and I've, uh, I don't know, there was a lot of rules, there was a long contract, maybe I didn't read everything, maybe like there's a certain amount of hours until I get released, but I would like to get out now, so if someone is watching this, and, uh, I'm gonna be sick, if somebody is watching this, and, uh, can please fucking like call someone or tell someone that I would like to come out, that would be great. Please do this for me right now. Um, I can't tell if I'm overreacting. I don't have like a scope. Um, all I know is that I don't feel okay. And maybe I'll get out and we'll all have a good laugh later about how I lost my shit on TV and everyone thought it was really fucking funny. But right now I need to come out. I'm so.
